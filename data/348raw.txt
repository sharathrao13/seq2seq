she's a cutie .
really .
you'll be happy .
i know it .
i'm a good judge of people .
for instance , i can see that you're nervous .
the first time you came to the bar , you were nervous too .
oops , the silent type .
an introvert .
am i right ... or am i right?
everything will be fine .
as long as you behave .
and produce the money .
carnival in hell , beware of tinkerbell .
her name is bieke .
go sit next to her .
go sit next to her .
go on .
can i see your drawing?
i'd rather not .
bieke .
what's wrong?
first time , hey?
i knew it .
i'm a good judge of people .
bieke !
i want to talk a bit first .
wouldn't you rather let me spoil you?
i want to talk a bit first .
about you , about the people who come here to visit .
my daddy doesn't allow that .
what's that?
daddy !
hey , dude .
hey , what's that?
damn .
he got caught !
vincke got caught !
quick !
quick , hurry !
hurry !
careful !
put the gun down !
put the gun down , damnit !
filthy bastards !
bastard !
take it easy .
she's coming with me , you hear?
here !
take it easy .
let's not do anything stupid .
not you ...
not us either .
we go outside together .
nothing has happened yet .
a lot has happened .
what would you know?
you think i'm stupid?
look at bieke .
she likes you .
you're her father .
she likes you .
she needs you .
what would you know?
you're a goner , pal .
you're a goner .
vincke ...
shtt , freddy .
freddy !
daddy !
daddy !

on your knees !
on your knees !
on your knees , now !
daddy !
they're assholes , bieke !
they're all assholes !
daddy !
daddy !
he could have told us a lot , freddy .
you know me , vincke .
no risks .
we should have busted him sooner .
we had enough .
i was hoping for more .
do you think i was the first one he asked to come up?
look at it from the bright side .
one less fatso , and the girl has been saved .
vincke?
eric?
in belgium?
there are potential customers there , angelo .
it would be an important market .
not for me .
fries , please .
right away .
but you just ordered some .
what's wrong with you?
gilles , you'd better send somebody else .
i'm tired .
don't start whining about retirement again .
angelo , people like us don't retire .
i hate belgium .
as does everybody .
but you know the place .
that's important .
don't you have a brother there?
you could pay him a visit .
if he's still alive .
visit his grave then .
most foreigners only know bruges in belgium .
they talk about bruges , bruges ...
but antwerp is much prettier , right?
there is more to see here than in bruges .
bruges is a lot smaller too .
it doesn't amount to much .
most people don't know ...
here you go , mr. ledda .
you have room 633 .
is this your first time in our hotel?
i speak dutch .
a bad habit .
i've got more of those .
and?
alone?
not anymore .
are you mr ...
casoni .
did you have a good trip?
i've got the files you asked for .
it's all there .
excuse me ...
yes , hello?
yes , i'm working hard on it .
no , he doesn't say much .
and he looks like his head has been under a tram for two years .
but they must know what they're doing , no?
yes .
my customer wants to know when .
if everything has been planned well , it'll go fast .
fast is too slow .
we want to know when .
first , i'm going to lay with my head under a tram for a year or two .
are you coming to the opening of the exhibition or not?
no time , honey .
building permits .
and a meeting in brussels .
but have fun .
after all , that's what you married me for .
a long time ago , yes .
what's that supposed to mean?
nothing , bob , nothing .
see you later .
if it gets too late , i'll have to spend the night in brussels .
ok .
but do me a favour .
buy her a better perfume .
typical !
your keys , i bet .
how often did i ...
are you smart?
are you smart , i asked .
if you're smart , you know who sent me .
are you smart?
if you're smart , you'll also know why i'm here .
do you know?
where is it?
downstairs?
where is it?
where is it?
you don't know who i am , do you?
if that cretin really thinks ...
if i give it to you , will you let me go?
please ...
i swear i won't talk .
daddy?
daddy , i'm going to katrien's , ok?
hello , who's speaking?
yes , it's me .
no , problem number 1 is solved .
no , you don't have to worry .
yes , see you soon .
yes , freddy .
how do you know it's me?
anybody in their right mind hangs up after 20 times .
what's up?
the big boss needs us .
it's rather urgent .
you absolutely had to be there .
on one of my rare days off .
give me ten minutes , ok?
never heard of mineral water?
mineral water?
in the morning?
definitely not with an clair .
shit !
fucking bmw's !
give way to the right .
pay some attention .
but it's true . isn't it?
they push you right off the road , flashing their lights .
made in germany and who drive them?
hair dressers and doorkeepers .
i'll tap their rear lights .
no , no .
i'll pee on their door handle .
yes .
it sticks and stinks like hell .
the insurance doesn't pay .
when you're rear light is broken ...
one phone call and it's solved .
you're on the wrong track .
you're punishing the wrong one .
yeah , yeah .
the insurance , the wrong one?
come on .
very urgent matter .
i'm curious .
good morning , chief .
freddy .
linda .
we don't know much .
mr. van camp didn't come home last night and didn't show up at work .
that's for missing people .
the national police have been there yet , but the lady is a good friend of the boss .
is van parys here?
yes .
he wants us to investigate the case very discretely .
why?
mr. van camp is quite a big shot .
director general of the planning department .
eva , chief vincke and inspector verstuyft .
nice to meet you .
mrs. van camp .
mrs. van camp is a good friend of my wife .
did linda brief you?
yes , well she told me what she knows .
the car is still in the garage .
it hasn't been used yet .
so ...
i'm afraid something happened .
did your husband have a reason to leave .
an argument maybe?
it this the first time he's gone overnight?
verstuyft , let vincke do his job .
look at that car .
coemans knows the way .
my husband knows these addresses .
but his work comes first .
he'd never not show up .
does he have any problems?
problems?
all big construction files pass through his office ,
i can imagine he has friends , but also enemies .
can we stick to the facts?
i'll try .
would you rather do the interrogation yourself?
or are we going to let our friends of the national police do their job?
van parys , damnit .
a political buddy falls asleep on top of his mistress and all antwerp has to act on it .
van parys wants to shag her .
can't you see?
i think she killed her man .
what shall we do?
search the whole forest?
drive , freddy .
wait .
don't you have a brother there?
you could go and see him .
paolo?
it's me , angelo .
sir?
can i help you?
are you related to mr. ledda?
distantly .
has he been here for a long time?
yes , yes .
very long .
it went fast .
it started ...
i know how it starts .
you're right .
why do you need to know french for a chief's exam?
to be able to read the menus in the posh restaurants .
coemans , shut up !
and stop ogling at linda , pig !
say , hasn't that file been handed to child welfare?
i borrowed it for a while .
over achiever .
does van parys know about it?
sometimes one has to go against the rules .
do we know anything about van camp yet?
linda and coemans are working on it , but so far , no news .
i promised mrs. van camp that we'd have some news .
freddy , you know somebody from the national police .
try to find out something .
chief , we're working on something else at the moment .
bieke cuypers , i guess?
the file that you requested from child welfare , behind my back .
sorry , but that case is closed for us .
miss cuypers?
brigitte?
everybody calls me bieke .
are you a friend of daddy?
are you a friend of daddy?
she's 12 , 13 at the most .
sorry , i'm not doing that .
you're wrong .
she looks much younger than she is .
she can't be older than 12 , 13 .
sorry , i won't do that .
you already said that .
you're stuck in a groove .
she's still a child .
i won't do it .
if you think you can do this to me , you've got another thing coming !
one phone call !
one phone call to marseille !
you don't get it .
nobody will do it .
forget it .
we'll find somebody else .
no , you won't !
no?
give me one reason why not .
i'll give you three .
one !
two !
and three !
the treasure chest of your good friend bob van camp .
understood?
crazy !
but ok !
did you hire a bunch of carnival singers?
my customer wants to see you .
tomorrow .
here , same time .
don't forget your box .
your wallet ...
mr. seynaeve .
van camp has just disappeared .
even his mistress doesn't know anything .
they check the passenger lists at the airports .
he fled abroad .
is that what they think?
is there any concrete information or is it occupational therapy?
concrete information?
occupational therapy?
our intellectual legal friend from the judicial police . commissioner .
if you need information , we're very happy to oblige .
but first send us an official piece of paper .
you're good at that , aren't you?
sorry , commissioner .
we didn't know you people could read .
i didn't know you had to learn to shoot .
and since you have to learn to shoot , mr. verstuyft , why don't you have your own shooting range?
unfortunately , we don't have the same budgets as the national police .
no .
it's because 90 % of your budget is spent on paper .
if i used too much paper , you can come and get some from us .
it'll be the night of your life .
yeah , yeah , i bet .
a night like you have never had before in your entire career .
some other time , ok?
come on .
look here .
room 105 .
perfect for a hot woman .
excuse me , you're bothering the lady , the other guests , and me .
and who are you?
her pimp , maybe?
tell me how much this hot truffle is going to cost me .
you're looking for something hot , right?
a gentleman?
no .
a customer .
relax , relax .
you were dreaming .
don't you know me anymore?
stay .
sorry .
stay .
i can hear your blood flow .
that's my head that's leaking .
you're a character .
can you tell?
i know .
i fancy strange men .
two bullets in the chest , one in the head .
professional job .
bastards .
bastards !
bastards !
and the other wounds?
from the ship propeller .
she must have been mangled by it .
freddy , make sure you'll become chief as soon as you can .
so i don't have to do it anymore .
the child was 12 years old , for crying out loud !
forensic investigation shows that the girl is the victim of a brutal murder .
her identity has now been released .
it's 12 year old brigitte cuypers , from merksem .
she was recently involved in child prostitution .
that case also cost her father his life .
have i been here all night?
say it .
have i been here all night?
yes .
where else?
come on , you have to go .
get dressed .
sorry .
back !
yes , but your pills ...
back !
you have to go back !
back !
shit .
you were right , gilles .
people like us don't retire .
vincke !
we have a witness .
a hotel guest .
mister casoni ...
your passport .
thank you .
hello .
vincke , chief .
you can speak flemish , chief .
i'm from everywhere and nowhere .
this gentleman knows the identity of the victim .
i just saw him get in .
the poor guy .
his name is ledda .
angelo ledda .
how do you spell that?
like in the swan , but with two d's .
that's greek mythology .
basic knowledge .
so you know mr. ledda?
yes ...
from here , in the bar .
a friendly person .
retired .
a real frenchman .
this was found under another car .
a credit card to angelo ledda's name .
guys , have a look !
i was waiting for that .
it's not your day .
baron?
it's time .
no , that's ok .
joseph can give the injection .
you guys are good at that , right joseph?
psychiatrists don't always knock people out , gustave .
sometimes we talk to our patients .
before or after the injection?
baron de haeck .
yes , it's me .
turn on the tv , baron .
teletext , brt , page 101 .
what do you think?
say what you want about those frenchies , but when they make a mistake , they fix it .
with a bulldozer if they have to .
you can sleep well , baron .
don't worry .
it's all over .
that is , if you didn't forget about me .
you didn't forget about me , did you , baron?
great .
if i may say so .
nothing beats doing business with an honest person .
there , our friend casoni .
but according to the french , this is the only bernard casoni .
young guy , centre half of olympique marseille , since 5 years .
you see , in our job , it's better to know your football than your greek mythology .
so what do we know?
angelo ledda .
yes , the credit cards are fakes .
in france they don't know him .
and here?
here they do .
the juvenile court has a file on him .
unfortunately , this ledda has been dead for 40 years .
let them send it anyway .
and the woman in the suitcase?
that's anja laeremans .
a prostitute , according to the barman .
no pimp , no criminal record .
also no family or friends , unfortunately .
we keep searching .
revenge in the prostitutes scene?
and what does an over achiever think?
yes , yes .
why not?
maybe the nijvel gang is also involved .
chief?
things are the way you thought .
the bullets are from the same gun .
the woman has been shot by the murderer of bieke .
now what?
problems?
impossible .
you're dead .
no , you're dead .
two bullets in the chest and one through the head .
again .
he isn't cold yet .
want to feel?
never mind .
stimorol .
he arrives , wants to open his gate .
the detector has been sabotaged .
he gets out and bam .
coemans ... did you give them the car?
affirmative , chief .
i am for 69 .
an even sicker mind than yours , freddy .
mrs. seynaeve ...
chief vincke and inspector verstuyft .
we're very sorry , ma'am .
life goes on .
if you were expecting tears and a black veil ,
i have to disappoint you .
but if you have questions , shoot .
where did your husband come from at such a late hour?
he was gone for business .
with whom and where ...
i don't know .
we don't talk about that .
we don't talk a lot anyway .
i'm not a big talker .
did your husband receive any threats in the past?
not from me .
did he have enemies?
no .
no , only friends .
my husband had many friends .
what i'm about to say , sounds harsh .
but we found this in your husband's mouth .
any idea?
no idea .
but i'm glad there still are some honest people .
or aren't you honest?
yes , i am .
i am , just a bit suspicious by nature .
if i give it to you , will you let me go?
i swear i won't talk .
if that idiot really thinks he ...
is he inside?
yes .
what are you doing?
good morning to you too , jean .
didn't you hear?
seynaeve has been shot .
impossible .
daddy , what on earth are you doing?
that guy is walking around outside here .
i wish ...
'i wish 'is for old bags .
'i want '.
don't worry .
he doesn't know me .
all leads end with seynaeve .
says who?
seynaeve?
says i.
bastards .
fucking bastards .
nothing .
we have nothing , people .
four murders and all we have are facts .
we need to connect the facts .
prostitution .
revenge .
but ...
bieke cuypers is child prostitution .
and anja is hotel prostitution .
two totally different scenes .
seynaeve has got nothing to do with prostitution .
he's in another league .
but he's been killed the same way as bieke cuypers .
not with the same weapon .
seynaeve's bullets are of a different calibre .
chief .
chief .
bernard casoni !
is that legal?
no , it's japanese .
vincke .
did you read the papers , chief?
the woman in the suitcase doesn't have anything to do with it .
she was an angel .
and you know what happened and want to help us?
help?
i'm doing your job for you .
get the scum of the streets , because you're too slow .
i don't have much time left .
and who are the scum?
i can't tell you yet .
then why do you call us?
if i can't finish it , you'll have to .
do you want the real bastards behind all this?
yes .
keep searching and you'll find them .
unless we find you first .
mister ...
ledda?
well done .
you already know my name .
i do now .
doesn't matter .
i have nothing to lose .
just my head .
ok , we've got him .
075/ 56 . 28 . 36 .
coemans , check with belgacom .
no need .
that's seynaeve's number .
why do these thugs have a mobile and we don't?
ledda is our man .
and we still have nothing .
vincke ...
remember how mrs. seynaeve was talking about those friends and how she reacted to the money?
can i try something?
if we pressure her a bit , she'll open up .
you'd like that , wouldn't you?
for her to open up .
let me give it a go .
freddy , i can't allow that .
vincke , you said it yourself .
sometimes you have to go against the rules .
mrs. seynaeve?
you almost look like a pro .
the door was open .
don't you know a better way of coming in?
thanks for letting me see you .
shoot .
do you know angelo ledda?
no .
bernard casoni?
big?
blond?
dark .
i know lots of those .
but , no , the name doesn't ring a bell .
he called us on your husbands mobile .
what do you think about that?
i should get it disconnected .
your act is very impressive .
i beg your pardon?
do you think i don't know why you're here?
ma'am , i'm ...
what did you think?
i should put here up against the wall?
i think you know more than you're saying .
oh , you're a real thinker .
i thought you were more about action .
come .
we can make each other happy .
angelo ledda?
no , never heard of him .
but that other name , casoni ...
i overheard that name once during a phone call ...
with de haeck .
the concrete baron?
the former minister?
you asked for a name , not a family tree .
come on ...
drink up before it gets too warm .
never on duty .
fucking belgian cop .
vincke ...
we have a name .
compliments of mrs. seynaeve .
de haeck .
minister of state?
his son .
jean de haeck .
he resigned last month as director general of planning .
who was his successor?
bob van camp .
fireworks?
i think so .
where does he live?
no , go on .
they'll call back .
blackmail .
that's it .
for years , van camp has been missing out on all these goodies .
they all go to big shots , like jean de haeck .
then he discovers de haeck's weak spot .
children .
bieke cuypers .
he's not answering .
again .
van camp blackmails de haeck and steals his promotion from him .
