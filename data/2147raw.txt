hey , pal ,
do you think it's a smart idea leaving your kid here where he might be a danger to people?

you might be held liable .
jeff , save it for law school .
cute kid .
hey .

yeah !
if you're interested in really good glasswork , it's cheap , but it's an antique .
some of those bottles up there are dated before the civil war .
and over there , i used to have in that empty space , i used to have some of the prettiest shirley temple bottles i've ever seen .
and this woman came in here with the palsy , the poor soul .
she thought they were so cute , and she reached for them and knocked every one down and broke them all to damn pieces .
so i took her in the back and gave her some coke and ammonia .
i thought she was gonna have a spell .
we should get something for your mom to say thanks .
how about some fox piss?
my mom would love fox piss .
oh lord , don't drop that .
if you do , that's powerful stuff .
all the foxes around would come down here .

he puts his hands on my face , full on tongue !
it was so gross !
why , was it gross because you've known him for so long or ...
'cause he's gross?
no , it was definitely him .
i don't know .
when you've known someone a long time , you just want to kiss them just to see if they're a good kisser .
there's nothing wrong with that , right?
no .
where are you going?
what's it look like?
i thought we were kissing .
yeah , we were .

we can't leave you alone for five minutes without you destroying something !
what were you shooting at?
i heard a squirrel .
i was just looking for a squirrel .
a squirrel?
yeah .
fucking idiot .
to stick up his ass .
why don't you tell us the story?
what are you gonna roast on that thing?
come on , paul , tell them story .
no , i can't .
it's a traumatic experience .
i don't want to talk about it .
we like traumatic stories .
not about me , but ...
trauma bonds people .
you can tell us .
it bonds those who go through it ,
not the people you tell it to .
tell the fucking story !
all right !
so there's this bowling alley when we were growing up .
you guys might remember it lenny meads brighton bowl?
it was in brighton , right?
that's probably why it was called brighton bowl .
we used to go there for birthday parties or with my dad for the weekend .
this one time , i asked my dad if we could go .
he's like , " no .
the bowling alley's closed .
this marshmallow's so burnt !
it turned out there had been a break in .
all the employees were held at gunpoint .
after they had been gagged and beaten , they were tied to chairs .
the chairs ... they were set in a circle , so that way everybody was forced to watch everybody else .
and then the robber , this sick maniac , he goes and finds one of those little ball peen hammers .
and then one by one ... he smashed the backs of their heads open with the hammer .
everyone had to watch their friends die , knowing that they'd soon be next .
ball peen ...
the guy doesn't stop there .
he breaks out the fire axe .
the alarm goes off ... he doesn't give a shit .
he hacked off all of their limbs .
the cops found six bloody torsos tied to the bowling seats .
blood everywhere ...
turns out the guy was some disgruntled employee .
that was my childhood playground .
bert , you asshole , it's not funny .
yes it is , you fucking slut .
jeff?
what?
tell them about the happy bald guy .
no , i can't take it .
he gave us our shoes and quarters for the video games .
there was a room with a pool table , but my dad wouldn't let us go there .
the bald guy was always happy , always smiling .
but the killer got him too .
when the cops searched the place , they found hacked off limbs at the end of the bowling lanes .
the guy had bowled people's organs .
arms , legs , everything .
they found the bald guy's head in the ball return .
he was still smiling .
oh , no .
i knew you were full of shit !
you suck !
no !
it was in the paper .
i swear !
i'm laughing because
jeff is an asshole and he's making me laugh .
i swear ...
i loved this place .
i still remember the sounds ... the cracking , the bouncing .
the smell of the shoes , the sound of the q bert machine ...
holy shit !
what are you doing? !
i'm cool .
are you spying on us?
i'm cool .
is your dog friendly?
yeah , he's cool .
this is dr. mambo .
here , boy .
come on , dr. mambo .
is it " dr. " like a physician or a professor?
yeah , he's a professor ... of being a dog .
oof !
faced !
scratch moded .
it's a positive bonfire .
got room for one more?
actually , we were having a private conversation , if you don't mind .
that's cool .
i guess i'll smoke all this weed by myself .
no , no .
it's fine .
it's not that private .
awesome .
yeah , sit right here .
i think he's gonna fuck her .
awesome .
wait , so your name was ...
justin ...
but you can call me " grim .
grim .
like grimace?
grim " is my skating name .
i got it in berkeley while competing in the x games .
really?
karen's going to go to berkeley .
dude ... awesome .
i love berkeley .
people there are so wacked .
i met these guys and they had me fucked up for five days straight .
they wouldn't let me drink anything but beer .
yeah , i've done that , except i did it with jd .
karen's got a great idea .
we should only drink beer for the rest of the trip .
i could probably do that , but i doubt you could .
i'll bet you .
i can only drink beer the rest of the trip .
if i drink anything else , you can have the rest of my supply .
all right , you're on .
we only drink beer .
you're on .
so , you're a skater?
is that your occupation?
oh , crap .
party's over .
hey justin ...
grim ... you want to come inside?
i'd love to , but i left all this shit outside my tent .
it's starting to rain , if it gets fucked up , it's like $4, 000 worth of shit pissed away .
how far away is your tent?
20 minutes away , but if i book i can be back in 30 .
cool .
bring the weed .
i will .
check you dudes later .
come on , dr. mambo .
freak .
i thought he was funny .
how did it work?
what do you mean " how "?
it had a hose ... a bunch of different settings , pulse , power ... stream .
and you came every time?
totally .
you can imagine my disappointment the first time i had sex .
tell me about it .
what's that supposed to mean?
i've got a better story .
i'm sorry , but no story is better than karen and the shower massage .
no , seriously .
one time i was masturbating ... and my dog came up and started licking my balls .
right as i came it stuck its tongue up my ass .
that's serious fucking masturbation talent right there .
fucking good .
he'd better have brought more weed or i won't let him in .
relax , pal .
i'm coming .
his name's grim .
jesus christ .
help me ... please .
i need a doctor .
oh shit .
doctor .
yeah , all right .
somebody grab a blanket or something .
you ... you shot me .
no , no , no .
there's no way this contagious fucker's coming in here .
he's sick , for christ's sake .
you want him to come in here and touch all of your shit , your fucking soap ...?
let's throw him a blanket or something .
or your douche?
let's drive him to a doctor .
he's not coming in !
we're out of range .
i'm not getting anything .
fuck !
what's that?
he's in the car .
what?
motherfucker .
why's he fucking with us?
grab your gun .

he's in the car already !
get out of the fucking car !
get out of there .

stop or i'll fucking stab you !
stop !
stop !
back off .
fuck off !
leave us alone !
fuck off !
i know .
i know .
what else were we gonna do?
first he gets his shit all over the car , and i don't want him touching me , you , or anybody .
i think the rain will put him out .
he's dead anyway .
you saw that shit on him .
he looked like he was skinned alive .
we have to tell the police it wasn't our fault .
i think we should tell them now .
calm down .
there's nothing we can do .
the car's fucked .
we need a mechanic .
we'll find somebody who knows one , and then we'll report the accident .
that's the keyword here .
it was an accident .
the guy's skin ... holy shit .
you should clean up some of this shit while we're gone .
i'll save some for you guys .
just stick with the girls .
what's that supposed to mean?
it means you're a fucking pussy .
that's fucked up .
what's fucked up is you beating the shit out of my truck .
what about the jag off with the rifle?
did you forget about him?
we all fucked up that car , don't just put it on me .
good morning , boys .
are you going to kill each other now?
where are you going?
to get help .
so ...
bert and jeff are gone .
i know .
last night was a fucked up situation ,
and i think ...
that guy asked for our help .
we lit him on fire .
can you understand if i'm not in a particularly social mood?
i got scared .
i was ...
i was just trying to help .
karen ...
i'm sorry , paul .
every time i close my eyes i see him .
it was an accident .
the guy was going to die anyway .
better?
yeah .
thanks , paul .
hello?
god damn it !
god damn it !
god damn it !
god damn it !
hold it !
you there !
do you see this? !
do you see this shit? !
we didn't see anything .
tell murray i can't eat this shit .
some animal's been running around infecting everything .
what am i supposed to do with a sick hog?
huh?
i am not about to eat that meat .
would you?
no , i'm a vegetarian .
none of this shit is good .
it's all sick .
it's all gotta go back .
i want me a new hog !
we were just looking for a mechanic .
mechanic?
you won't find one around here .
you'll have to go to town .
that's the thing .
our car's busted , so we can't get into town .
we need somebody to take us into town
so we can find a mechanic .
oh .
i've already been in town today , sorry .
all right , if you do go back , would you tell us?
we're staying at a cabin , and ... we don't know murray .
oh , i'm sorry .
yes , of course , of course .
why didn't you just come out and say that?
come on inside , i've got a radio .
we'll call ricky .
he's got a tow truck .
call ricky .
ricky .
sorry to bother you , but this crazy guy came out of the woods and tried to trash our car .
sounds terrible .
i have some juice .
so this person damaged your car?
it was just this crazy hermit .
real dangerous .
we chased him away with bats .
it wasn't henry , was it?
nah , shit , never .
henry?
my cousin henry .
he knows about that ordinance .
he wouldn't do something like that .
you hit him with a bat?
no .
no , it wasn't henry .
our friend walter , he got drunk .
one thing led to another ...
that's no good .
yeah .
i've got a great idea .
why don't we take a walk down ourselves?
it's really nice out .
we'll just walk .
i haven't seen the scenery .
you sure?
ricky's awfully handy .
thanks for your help .
are you sure?
a little fresh air sounds great .
we really appreciate your help .
take care .
we burned henry .
fuck !
hello?
hello?
hello?
hello?
hello?
is anyone home?
hello?
ah !
bert , you dick nose .
shut up .
what the hell?
did you find anybody?
no , nothing .
i followed the path that the old guy ran , but i couldn't find him .
he could still be alive .
no , it's impossible .
want any beef jerky?
no , put it away .
why?
it's not our house .
so?
did you find a phone?
no .
i felt weird looking around .
there's nobody here .
we found this other place , but ... there was nobody there either .
i wonder if the cops know about it yet .
i doubt it .
if they did know , they'd have been at the cabin by now .
good morning .
deputy winston ,
bunyan county sheriff's department .
hi .
what can i do for you?
i'm on patrol in my jurisdiction and i heard there was a lot of commotion here last night .
i wanted to know what the story is .
yeah , sure .
some guy tried to break into our cabin .
and he was sick .
i don't know what kind of disease he had , but he was a mess .
i have to report this .
yeah , totally .
my friends are out looking for a neighbor so we could call you .
we don't have a phone here .
everyone uses radios .
that's what i use .
hey ...
looks like you guys were doing some pretty good partying , huh?
yeah , you know , we were drinking ... and then this guy came along and tried to break into the cabin .
we had no choice but to get rough .
i feel awful , but he was going crazy .
he smashed into our car , and then he wouldn't come out , so ... we had to hit him .
we hurt him .
we were terrified .
we didn't know what to do .
that's why we went to look for help
hey , man , i told you ...
i'm gonna make a report .
don't worry about it .
he ain't gonna come back .
looks like you guys scared him away pretty good .
i ain't gonna let him ruin your fun .
thank you .
my friend's inside right now and she's pretty freaked out .
she wants to go home .
we all kind of do .
a lady friend , huh?
i bet you like to party ... with the ladies .
paul?
is everything okay?
howdy , ma'am .
everything's fine .
just go back inside , have yourself a big 40 , just party .
umm ... okay .
oh , daddy , why are you talking about leaving?
you've got to stay and party .
that's why we came here in the first place .
i'm telling you , this is a major party town .
really?
are you kidding me?
you know what it's like when you go to a new town and you're the new guy?
all the girls see you walking down the street ... they don't know you've got five pounds of dangling meat .
they're looking for no commitment .
you understand what i'm saying?
i've heard that theory before .
this is that town .
it's like when i go party up at wambusau .
my cousin goes to school there .
when i party at wambusau , i know i'm gonna get pussy .
plus the girls there don't know i'm a deputy .
so i know they're gonna party hard with me .
believe me , man , they do .
that's too bad , i bet you ruled this town before you had a badge .
yeah , but a badge makes you grow up quick .
shit , this guy went and did a number on your ride .
i'm gonna put out an apb .
we're gonna catch this guy .
yeah , it wasn't totally him .
we hit it too .
but we were trying to scare him away .
could you get somebody up here to fix it?
what do i look like?
an idiot?
i'll have someone up here by tomorrow afternoon .
you're top priority .
you're the party man .
do you realize how many great parties we're gonna have?
fortune's shining on you .
i know where all the big parties are at .
remember , my name is winston .
you know how to get a hold of me , right?
9 1 1?
that's it , my man .
take it easy .
yeah .
did he say he was gonna report this shit or not?
i think he is .
he didn't make it seem like we did anything wrong .
he said he'd get a tow truck up here .
sounds weird to me .
the guy was weird .
once he saw karen , he didn't want to leave .
has karen left her room yet?
no , she's still sleeping .
i don't know what's up with her .
she wants to get out of here as soon as she can .
puts a kink in your plan , huh?
what plan?
what plan?
the plan you've been trying to execute since eighth grade .
no , there's no plan .
not anymore .
whatever .
you guys are funny .
fucking ... she likes you because you're nice to her and she's nice to you because she can control you .
fucking , you're nice to her ...
bert , don't move .
fuck .
it's that freak's dog .
should i hit it?
i don't know .
if you're gonna hit it , hit it hard .
so where's grim?
he's out there rotting .
there's some sick shit in the woods and the hermit's spreading it around .
i'm not waiting for that deputy to come back .
let's get out of here now .
should we say something on our way out , like , " by the way , we burned some guy alive "?
yes .
no .
jeff .
fine , we'll tell the cops .
we have to .
they're gonna figure it out .
the deputy knows something happened .
we're the only outsiders .
they're gonna trace it back to us .
i feel nauseous .
karen ...
how soon can you get us out of here?
i don't know if i can fix the car .
i'm thinking i could make it drivable , we could drive into town and tell them what happened .
and that'll be that , right?
but you're gonna have to watch me with the gun .
i'm not gonna go out there with that fucking dog around .
i need a bath .
jeff's mom has the stupidest ideas
let's get a cabin .
so gay .
hey .

some kids up in a cabin are on a killing spree .
there's two , possibly three casualties .
they are armed and hostile .

they've got some kind of skin virus that will eat you alive .
so if you do see them , do not hesitate to shoot them .

it was a guy from the woods .
oh god , he looked like bert's marshmallow .
he told me he would get a tow truck .
i should have killed him too .
we're not equipped to handle a situation like this .
cook county is his only shot .

the fucking party man !
i guess the party ain't over , huh?
