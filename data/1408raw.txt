i had this image of you inside of me ...
iike a part of me .
you planned this whole thing .
we make our own choice .
we pay our own prices .
five years is a long time .
where's the fuckin 'money?
all part of the business .
all part of the business .
you made a choice once .
what choice?
i want out .
like a part of me .
hold the elevator .
thanks .
yeah , i looked over everything , sir .
i don't think there should be any problems .
yes , sir , i ordered the vanity and i looked at the tub .
i'm pretty sure we can rout it out .
yeah , i'll start everything first thing tomorrow .
thanks again for this opportunity , mr. bianchini .
yeah .
hi .
my name is violet .
we sort of met on the elevator .
i'm corky .
i heard you working in here , and i was wondering ... if you'd like a cup of coffee .
sure .
come on in .
just give me a second .
all right .
what happened to rajiv?
he went home to lndia or someplace , but i think he'll be back .
so this is just a temporary situation for you?
yeah , pretty much .
one day at a time .
i guessed you're a straight black .
good guess .
thanks .
my pleasure .
to be honest , i did have a slightly ulterior motive .
i was wondering if i might ask you a little favor .
favor .
yeah .
i'm kind of a night person , and i was wondering ... if you might wait a little bit before you start using the power tools .
oh , sorry .
oh , no .
no .
it's not your fault .
it's just the walls here are so terribly thin .
really .
it's like you're in the same room .
if it's too much trouble , i understand .
it's no trouble at all .
i got a lot to do here .
you doin 'all the work yourself?
that is so amazing .
i am so in awe of people who can fix things .
my dad was like that .
we never had anything new .
whenever anything was broken , he would just ... open it up , tinker with it a little bit ... and fix it .
his hands were magic .
i'll bet your car is 20 years old .
truck .
truck .
of course .
'63 chevy .
i knew it .
well , i guess i should be going .
you can drop the cup off at any time .
thanks .
my pleasure .

i'm feeling a little bit curious myself .
that's a great tattoo .
beautiful labris .
are you surprised i know what it is?
maybe .
i have a tattoo .
would you like to see it?
a woman in upstate new york did it for me .

took her all day to do it .
she promised it wouldn't hurt , but ... it was sore for a long time after .
i couldn't even touch it .
now i love the way it feels .
here .
touch it .
what are you doing?
lsn't it obvious?
i'm trying to seduce you .
why?
because i want to .
i've wanted to ever since i saw you that day in the elevator .
i know you don't believe me ... but i can prove it to you .
you can't believe what you'd see ... but you can believe what you feel .
i've been thinking about you all day .
you planned this whole thing .
you dropped that earring down the sink on purpose , didn't you?
if i say yes , will you take your hand away?

that's none of your goddamn business .
you're right .
she's right .
it's none of my goddamn business .
you don't have to tell me .
it's just
i want you to understand one thing , all right?
you're amongst good people here .
come on , come on .
if you understand what i'm talkin 'about , you'll take the money .
if you don't , then i'm gonna have to worry about you .

i hate to worry .
i got ulcers .

get her a drink .
i gotta go clean out my brushes .
another time .
right .
another time .
mmm , corky , corky .
what are you doing?
i had to see you .
look .
i don't think this is a good idea .
i wanted to apologize .
no , please , don't apologize .
if there's one thing i can't stand it's woman who apologize for wanting sex .
i'm not apologizing for what i did .
i'm apologizing for what i didn't do .
you have a bed somewhere?
i can see again .
i needed that .
so caesar's mafia , huh?
you have to ask?
no .
funny .
nobody really calls it that anymore .
caesar just calls it " the business .
how did you meet him?
they took over a club i was working at .
caesar started managing it .
he's a launderer?
basically .
how long you been with him?
about five years .
five years is a long time .
yes , it is .
the redistribution of wealth .
excuse me?
lsn't it what you wanted to know?
what i did time for?
the redistribution of wealth "?
that's what i tell someone when i'm trying to get them in my bed .
but i'm already in your bed .
my cell mate would say she did her time for getting caught .
she was always a lot more honest than me .
you didn't have to tell me if you didn't want to .
i guess i wanted to .
i'm glad you did .
so am i.
ding let me tell you about a girl i know ding
ding she is my baby and she lives next door ding
ding every mornin 'before the sun comes up ding
ding she brings my coffee in my favorite cup ding
ding that's why i know ...
ding you think i don't know that?
please .
come on .
will you just i have to leave tonight .
don't make me beg , violet .
two minutes .
thank you .
hey , violet .
you look great .
i had this image of you inside of me .
like a part of me .
you are so beautiful .
what's wrong?
nothing .
yes , there is .
you didn't want to see me , did you?
if there's one thing i can't stand about sleeping with women ... it's all the fucking mind reading .
i don't understand .
i know , violet .
that's 'cause you can't understand .
we're different .
we're not that different , corky .
ah , let's see .
this is the part where you tell me ... what matters is on the inside ... and that inside of you there's a little dyke just like me .
no , she's nothing like you .
she's a whole lot smarter than you are .
is that what her daddy tells her?
i know what i am .
i don't have to have it tattooed on my shoulder .
you saying you don't have sex with men?
i don't .
for christ's sake , i heard you .
thin walls , remember?
what you heard wasn't sex .
what was it?
work .
you made certain choices in your life that you paid for .
you said you made them because you were good at something ... and it was easy .
you think you're the only person that's good at something?
we make our own choices .
we pay our own prices .
i think we're more alike than you care to admit .
what about that guy this morning?
shelly?
don't tell me .
you're a workaholic .
no , shelly knows what i am .
he saw me in a bar with another woman .
yeah .
i suppose he just wants to watch .
fuck it .
i think you'd better leave .
yeah , i think i'd better .
try not to steal anything on the way out .
where the fuck is it?
i didn't do it !
i swear to you !
come on !
where is it?
oh , that hurt , didn't it?
ow !
you think you're smart?
where's that fuckin 'money?
please , please !
please , let me go !
please stop it !
don't make me beg !
stop it !
please !
please stop !
tryin 'to fuck us?
you wanna fuck me?
you piece of shit .
we're goin 'home .
nobody fucks him !
i'm not fucking him !
i swear to god !
johnnie !
ho !
he's making too much noise .
you hear that , bitch?
shut up .
give me a towel .
shut up !
here .
put it in his mouth .
caesar , i'm leaving .
what?
why?
i didn't use a good towel .
caesar , i'm serious .
i can't take this .
i have to get out of here .
why?
'cause you know him?
aw , you see?
baby , that's what i love about you .
you're so fuckin 'sensitive .
but i like you here .
i want you to stay .
this is hard on me too .
i like shelly .
so why don't you watch some tv and put on a cassette or something?
you okay , violet?
mick , why is johnnie here?
you know how i feel about that psycho fuck?
caesar , didn't i tell you to get something?
sure .
sorry about that .
you shouldn't have to see this .
why don't you get out of here?
go for a walk .
caesar wants me to stay .
don't worry about caesar .
i'll handle caesar .
get out of here .
we can go all night , bitch .
okay .
thank you , mickey .
here you go .
all fuckin 'night , baby !
all night !
hey , johnnie , ease up , okay?
bitch !
pick him up .
shelly ,
i'm gonna ask you ten times .
you understand?
ten times .
yeah .
one .
where's our money?
you all right?
come on .
let's get out of here .
keep it .
shelly was skimming from the business .
he came to see me yesterday because he was afraid caesar found out .
he wanted to run , but he wanted me to come with him .
even though he knew about you .
yeah .
this guy's in love with you?
that's what he tells himself , but it's not even about me .
he could have run at any time , but he didn't want out .
it sounds like he wanted to get caught .
yeah .
maybe he did .
he would brag to me all the time .
he was never afraid of caesar because ... he didn't know him .
not like i do .
i used to be able to block it out .
or i'd just tell myself that ...
i wasn't really there , and so ... none of it really mattered .
but i can't do that anymore .
i'm making the same mistake shelly made ... but now i know what i want .
i want out .
i want a new life .
i see what i've been waiting for , but i can't do it alone .
i need your help , corky .
caesar's gonna get the money  how much money?
shelly said it's over two million dollars .
yeah .
so caesar's gonna get it .
he's gonna bring it by the apartment .
he's gonna count it .
he's gonna go through the books and try and figure out how shelly did it .
wait a minute .
violet , do you know what you're saying?
you're asking me to help you fuck over the mob .
violet , these people are serious .
you wanna know how serious?
ask your friend shelly .
they're worse than any cop because they have lots of money and no rules .
you fuck them , you better do it right .
that's why i need your help .
you said you were good .
i am good .
let's just say for a moment i believe everything you're saying .
you think i'm lying?
i didn't say that .
but since you did , iet's say you are .
it would have been easy for you to set up shelly .
you could have had him killed ... knowing that caesar would bring the money back to the apartment .
all you would need to keep yourself clean is someone unconnected .
someone like me .
is that what you think?
i'm just making a point .
you have no idea what you're asking ... how much trust it takes two people to do something like this .
for me , stealing has always been a lot like sex .
two people who want the same thing .
they get in a room , they talk about it .
they start to plan .
it's like flirting .
it's kind of like foreplay .
because the more they talk about it , the wetter they get .
the only difference is , i can fuck someone i've just met .
but to steal , i need to know someone iike i know myself .
you think you know me like that?
i wanna see the money .
oh , my god !
don't worry .
it ain't mine .
caesar , what happened?
it was unbelievable , vi .
un fuckin 'believable !
shit !
look at this shirt .
look at it .
it's ruined .
it all started when shelly took us to the money .
i'll tell you something .
mickey , he knows his shit .
he does .
shelly took us right there .
so shelly's down on his knees , right ... and he's pulling out this money from a safe on the floor ... and i'm standin 'there ... and i'm lookin 'at it , right?
like , " holy fuck !
all i can think about is , " how the fuck was he able to do this , " when bang !
johnny caps him .
he caps shelly !
blood goes flyin 'everywhere .
all over me .
all over the money .
i have no idea if this is even all of it .
and right then , i go through the roof and bam !
i punch the dumb son of a bitch .
i punch him right in his dumb fuckin 'face .
i didn't give a shit whose son he was .
i just wanted to hit him again smack some sense into the dumb son of a bitch !
look at the shit that i gotta fuckin 'deal with now !
what are you gonna do with it?
i told him to run it through the cycle .
but no , johnnie calls up the old man , and i guess he's got other plans ... because he wants to pick up this shit tomorrow night .
where's the laundry detergent?
it's in the linen cabinet .
come to my place in the morning , early .
you think you know me like that?
two million dollars .
you're having second thoughts .
no .
you said caesar washed the money?
yeah .
then what?
exactly .
he hung it up .
he what?
to let it dry .
it was unreal .
hundreds paper clipped everywhere iike leaves .
then one by one he ironed all of it .
did he sleep?
no , but neither did i.
all night long i listened to that sound .
what sound?
the sound of money .
where is it now?
it's in his office .
i saw it this morning .
i need to go to the store .
it's in a case on his desk .
does the case lock?
yes .
huh .
tell me about johnnie .
johnnie?
sounds like he and caesar don't like each other .
like each other?
they hate each other .
why?
i don't know .
happened long before i came around .
i think it's basically caesar thinks johnnie's a complete idiot ... but , you know , what can you do?
johnnie runs chicago 'cause gino's his father .
who's gino?
gino marzzone .
marzzone , as in angelo marzzone , head of the marzzone family?
yeah , that's his brother .
shit .
gino marzzone's coming to your place tonight to pick up the money?
yeah .
and johnnie marzzone's his son?
that's johnnie?
yeah .
sweet jesus .
it's perfect .
gino marzzone's coming to your place tonight .
this is a big deal .
caesar's gonna want to do it right .
he won't want to look like an idiot .
has gino been to your place before?
yeah , twice .
what happened?
caesar was really nervous .
he kept cleaning the apartment .
the first time he picked out the dress he wanted me to wear .
did johnnie ever hit on you?
johnnie hits on me all the time .
he hits on anything in high heels .
did caesar ever see this?
he does it right in front of him .
this is getting better and better .
go on .
well , gino doesn't speak much english , or at least he pretends not to ... so he usually gets right to the point .
both times they only talked for about five minutes .
they had a drink and then they left .
what did gino drink?
scotch .
glenlivet .
i remember that 'cause caesar made a big deal about it .
all right .
i have an idea how to make this work .
go back and get ready .
take your time .
make it real .
what time did you say they'd be there?
the plane gets in at 7 : 00 , so i'd say around 8 : 00 .
all right .
now , at some point , caesar's gonna quit .
i guess sometime around 6 : 00 , making sure he's got time to get ready .
as soon as he's done , you'll be there to put a big drink in his hand .
unbelievable what this guy shelly did .
i'll tell you , shelly's one smart ass motherfucker .
i mean , he was one smart ass motherfucker .
poor boy .
has to work so hard .
you want him to relax , unwind .
you look good enough to eat .
where will you be?
i'll be waiting in the apartment next door .
waiting for what?
for the shower .
that's gonna be our signal .
when he's done with his shower , you'll go to the bar .
you'll get out the scotch that gino drinks .
as you do , the bottle will slip from your hands .
an accident .
vi , what the hell was that?
vi , you can't hear me?
ah , fuck !
caesar , it slipped .
i was trying to get ready .
how the fuck did you do that?
caesar , it was an accident .
i didn't mean to .
i'll get some more .
there's no fuckin 'time !
don't be silly .
there's lots of time .
i'll clean this up and i'll be back before you're even dressed .
fuck , vi !
when you open the door , i'll be there .
what if he sees you?
he won't .
you can't know for certain that he won't see you .
trust me .
i'm just asking .
what if?
if he does ... then i won't have a choice , will i?
when i'm inside , i'll get the money .
i'm gonna need something to fill the case .
hide it near the desk .
and at that point ... there's no turning back .
when i get the scotch ... how do i know you won't just take off?
the same way i'll know that you went to go get the scotch .
trust .
i still don't see how i'm gonna get away clean ... with all the money in the apartment .
everyone's gonna think i took it .
not caesar .
why?
'cause of what you're gonna tell him .
you gotta be as real as you can .
the moment you walk through that door with the scotch ... you'll be covered .
that moment's the most important moment of the plan .
'cause if you're real enough , he's gonna believe you , 'cause deep down ... he'll want to .
c?
shit , i'm sorry .
they were early .
what are you talkin 'about?
they just left , didn't they?
what , are you drunk?
they weren't just up here?
no , they're still on their way .
that doesn't make any sense .
why?
i just saw johnnie downstairs .
what?
yeah .
i was getting out of my car , and i saw him in his bmw .
nah , it couldn't have been .
it was him , caesar .
i'm positive .
vi , that's impossible .
caesar , i know johnnie .
it was him .
i screamed when i saw him .
i couldn't believe i missed him .
i knew you were gonna be upset , so i thought i'd stop and apologize ... and give gino the scotch , but ...
i honked a couple of times , and johnnie didn't even hear me .
he didn't stop .
but ...
gino's plane doesn't get here for another half hour .
actually , i didn't see gino in the car .
if caesar hates johnnie as much as you say , when he opens that case ... he's gonna know in his gut that johnnie just fucked him .
he'll have no choice .
he can't go after gino or johnnie .
there's only one way out .
he'll have to run .
and if he runs ... everyone will assume he took the money .
you'll be clean , and we'll be rich .
jesus , that's beautiful .
if you're this goddamn smart , how did you ever get caught?
i had a partner once .
she fucked me .
i won't .
i think we're gonna find out .
oh , god !
caesar?
no .
c?
oh , no .
oh , god .
vi .
vi , i've been set up .
johnnie?
that fuck !
that rat fuck !
that motherless rat fuck !
why?
why would johnnie do this?
jesus christ .
violet , open your fucking eyes .
johnnie hates me as much as i hate him .
i hate that motherless rat fuck .
i fuckin 'hate him .
but you know he did it .
yeah .
so what?
so fucking what?
look , the money is gone , right?
gino's coming to get it .
do you think gino is going to believe me when i tell him ... his little rat fuck son stole it?
'cause i don't .
you know what i think?
i'm a dead man .
i'm one in the back of the head .
that's what i think .
what are we gonna do?
i know what johnnie wants me to do .
johnnie wants me to run .
he wants me outta here .
but if i run , then everybody thinks i fucking did it ... and he gets away with two million clean .
i can see him right now ... on the way to get gino , iaughin 'at me !
laughin 'at me , laughin 'at me !
laughin 'at me !
fuckin 'laughin 'at me !
don't !
please .
don't touch me , okay?
i gotta think .
i gotta fuckin 'think this through !
caesar , i think we should run .
we have to go now , before it's too late !
please , violet , leave me alone .
please , all right?
just leave me the fuck alone !
all right , caesar .
i gotta think , that's all .
i just gotta think .
it's me .
what happened?
he totally freaked out .
i've never seen him like this .
he's out of his fucking mind .
that's all right , as long as he believes it was johnnie .
believes it?
jesus !
it's driving him crazy .
he wants to kill him .
i don't know , corky .
i'm getting really nervous .
i don't know what he's gonna do .
it's all right , violet .
it's working .
all we gotta do is wait him out and see what he does .
what if he doesn't run?
that means he'll probably kill johnnie .
oh , christ !
i have to get out of here !
listen , if he doesn't run , all you gotta do is break down .
go into the bedroom and pack some things .
start crying .
tell him you love him , but you can't take it .
you're sorry , but you gotta leave , and just walk out .
all right .
okay .
we're almost there .
just hang on .
he's coming !
i know what i have to do .
i have to get the money back .
the money?
the money's gone .
no , johnnie's got it .
i gotta get it back .
it could be anywhere .
there's not enough time , violet .
johnnie's gotta pick up gino at the airport , right?
that means he's probably got the money with him in the car .
did he see you?
no .
good .
that's good .
that means i got the edge .
he doesn't know i know .
that's why he put the paper in the case .
he wants me to hand it to gino .
then there's no doubt i did it .
gino will put a bullet in me himself .
but that's not gonna happen .
that jack off's not gonna set me up .
no way .
not like this .
this is insane .
what are you doin '?
i'm leaving .
i don't want any part of this shit .
i don't want to be involved .
you can't leave .
the hell i can't .
i need you .
you don't need me .
you've never needed me .
i can't help you , understand?
i can't let you leave .
if you're not with me , i have to assume you're against me .
caesar , this is crazy .
maybe it is .
maybe it isn't .
maybe you dropped that bottle of scotch by accident .
maybe you didn't .
i would've been so easy ... to let him in as you left .
you can't believe that .
i've seen the way he looks at you .
he's always wanted you .
maybe two million bucks finally bought you .
i'm sorry , violet .
i wanna trust you .
but you understand .
i don't have any other choice .
you sure you don't want a drink?
hello .

what are you doing?
maybe three hours .
caesar , what are you going to do?
we're gonna get the money back .
what?
violet , if we get the money back , then none of this ever happened .
caesar , you just killed gino marzzone .
no , i didn't .
not if the bodies disappear .
not if the money's here .
then they never showed up .
what happened to them?
i don't know .
maybe we'll never know .

all part of the business .
look , once we find the money , then everything's gonna be all right .
somebody's coming .

oh , no .

i'm gonna ask you ten questions .
every time i don't get an answer ...
i cut off a finger .
where's the money?
it's mickey .
i said , " where's the money?
all right , i'll tell you .

christ !
mickey , you scared the shit out of me .
what are you guys doin 'with your peckers in your hand?
you gonna do me , mickey?
no .
there was no answer .
i thought i heard some knocking at the door .
i was buzzing , i was knocking ... but i guess you couldn't hear me on account of being in the shower .
yeah , well , you know , mick , i'm all wound up .
i'm driving myself crazy over this gino thing , and , well ...
vi , you know , she thought maybe ... she could , you know , relax me in the
that violet is one nice lady .
i wish someone would help me relax .
uh , let me get you guys a drink , huh?
i got scotch , whatever you want .
we was worried about you .
me?
why?
we went over to johnnie's place , just to check it out .
it was busted up , bad .
what?
started thinking maybe it's about the money .
so i call you , but all i got is the busy signal .
i figure the phone is off the hook .
that's why i come rushing over here .
fuck , the phone .
shit .
that was me .
i did that .
fuck !
that was a stupid thing to do , huh?
hey , if violet was helping me relax ...
i'd probably do the same thing .
hey , caes , can i ask you something?
sure .
why did you move all the furniture around?
let me guess .
that was violet's idea too .
yeah , uh , actually ... she was nervous about gino comin '... and wanted everything to look perfect and
you know women , mick .
sure , caes .
they make us do stupid things , don't they?
ls that the money?
yeah .
yeah , that's it .
what did it total out at?
2 . 176 .
that fuckin 'shelly .
gotta hand it to the guy , but , jesus ... if i were him , i would've bailed a long time ago .
i mean , how much money does a man need?
i remember , i was just staring at all this goddamn money .
shelly went down on his knees ... and the next thing i know , johnnie just blows his head off .
what a fuckin 'mess .
johnnie's laughing his ass off ... and that's when caesar lost it .
and boom .
he cold cocked him .
he cold cocks fuckin 'johnnie marzzone .
