that's my mom's car !
all right , frannie .
the man said he'd pay for ...
oh , looks like you killed my bike here too .
i'm sorry .
l ...
how did you blow out your tires?
someone left some barbed wire in the middle of the road .
i can't believe someone just dropped it there .
nobody dropped anything .
i just found this tied to a tree .
somebody did this .
southern hospitality at its finest .
redneck assholes .
i'm gonna try and find a phone .
i think i saw a gas station like a couple miles back .
i'm gonna come with you .
there is no phone .
i was just there .
why don't we just wait for someone else to come along?
what , like speed racer here?
i'm not going anywhere .
okay , you guys go , and we'll just stay here , francine .
and get high .
yeah .
so what?

they don't like stoners .

your mom .
hey , what's your name?
chris flynn .

no , i'm fine .

'cause you're the mule .
oh , no .

are you sure you're all right?
yeah?
yeah .
i'm fine .
what are you guys doing out here?
uh , uh , oh , camping .
uh , i don't know .
actually , we're lost .
you know , a lot of people say ... who have been through similar traumatic experiences ... that the following moments kind of feel like you're moving kind of in slow motion .
do you feel like that?
no .
i should tell you that my voice is fairly low and normal speed .
pretty good .
mm hmm .
where'd you get this?
um , i got it out of my dad's room , actually .
you can finish it .
i can't believe they called us stoners .
dickheads .
are you sure you know where we're going?
yeah .
there was a map at the gas station .
oh , i'm so tired already .
i'm starving , and i'm being eaten by ants .
are there any on my back?
no , nothing there .
oh , hey ho !
i call it .
uh , squirrel .
well , you said you were hungry , carly .
i don't think it's a squirrel .
it's a mink .
really?
how do you know?
probably ran over it .
in medical school , they make you work on animal cadavers before you get to the real thing .
it's a mink .
oh .
it's a mink?
i need to be in raleigh by 7 : 00 .
hmm .
better get a move on , then .
you know , we should've just taken her to new york .
no .
you know how she loves this outdoor stuff .
yeah .
if you ask me , though , nature sucks .
well , the next time she gets dumped , we'll take her to new york .
drop your pants .
what?
when do people always show up , evan?
what are we doing?
consider it an experiment in probability theory .
really?
mmm .
i love you .
i know .
now get them trousers off , boy .
don't be a sissy .
all right .
you know , i've been thinking about this whole wedding thing ... and i think we should take a trip down to mexico .
mm hmm .
i'm talking about a long weekend ... margaritas , the two of us on a beach alone , sunset .
and , you know , i'm talking about just , just eloping .
you know what i mean?
uh , wait a second .
you wanna know what i think?
yes , please .
i think if you ever want to get in my pants again , affirmative .
this is the last time you use the " e " word .
okay?
okay .
yeah , it's a disgusting word .
hey , guys , hold on .
hey , is anyone up there?
hello !
there must be people nearby .
anyone up there?
somebody had to start it .
let's keep moving .
hello?
freaky .
oh , look at this .
it's fucked !
nothing .
nothing .
hey , did you find anything to eat?
they took all my power bars .
um , no .
no .
sorry .
damn it .
scott and carly took all our friggin 'sunscreen .
does he have any good cd's?
mmm .
definitely not .
you know , i think this guy must be some kind of doctor .
maybe we could get him to write us some prescriptions when he gets back .
he doesn't have any smokes either .
almost out .
evan?
evan?
where are you?
hey , baby , what are you doing?
i'm just ... amusing myself .
whoooo !
you , uh , getting anything there , chatty?
no , nothing .
i'm gonna miss this thing .
why didn't you just fly?
i put all of my money into that car back there .
okay , forget eloping , but there is an idea we should discuss about the band for our wedding .
i think we should hire a ... you know , a frank sinatra type , uh , lead singer ... as opposed to a james brown type lead singer ... because , you know , really , let's be honest , there's only onejames brown ... and , you know , a faux james brown is really quite intolerable .
evan?
where are you?
you pissing or something?
evan?
you know , plus he'd be grinding his hips , and my grandmother would be ... yes , revolted but also strangely fascinated in a completely disturbing way ... and , um ...
baby?
carly , i wa ...
i was kidding .
carly?
evan?
sweetheart?
hey , guys , hold up !
guys , hold up for a second , all right?
baby , seriously , this isn't funny .
jesus god !
baby !
l ...
oh , i'm so sorry .
i could've killed you , woman .
i'm i'm extremely dangerous .
you wanna know why i love you so much?
because you're so fun to play with .
is that why you love me?
that really scared me , baby .
i'm sorry .
that really scared me .
would you not do that?
hello . !
hello . !
there's , uh , nothing like stating the obvious , huh?
hey , baby , look at this .
whoo !
hey , carly , i think this would be good time for you to confront your fear of ...
don't !
okay , that is not funny .
look who's scared now .
sorry .
whatever .
just get me to a motel room ... run me a very hot bath ... and be prepared to provide me with a lot of orgasms .
oh !
i think they need to be alone .
what do you expect?
they just got engaged .
they're happy .
it's a hard thing to find .
yeah .
got it?
limber tongue .
got it .
you're stupid .
maybe we shouldn't have left francine and evan .
don't worry .
they're fine .
you guys okay?
super .
well , wait , guys .
this road isn't on here .
that's because you don't have the redneck world atlas .
uh , uh , uh , uh , uh .
i think we've just been saved , kids .
can i get a ...
make this quick .
actually , maybe we should keep walking .
what?
the next house is gonna have a white picket fence?
yeah , if there is a next house .
hey .

hello?
all right , this isn't right .
hello?
hello?
anybody home?
whoa , baby !

oh , fuck .
oh , my god .
look at this place .
seriously , guys , i think we should go .
help me find the bathroom .
then we'll go .
baby , what if this place belongs to some kind of cult?
i read in newsweek how economically depressed places ... are like breeding grounds for all kinds of apocalyptic visionaries .
order of the solar temple , church of the lamb of god , the chijon family .
remember them?
hey , brainiac !
shh !
all right .
maybe that door .
christ !

it's like the garage sale from hell .
jesus .
can you believe this?
jesus , these guys are ripping people off .
i mean , this is like $30, 000 worth of stuff .
chris .
mm hmm .
we should leave .
