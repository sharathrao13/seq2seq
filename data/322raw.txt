sentinels .
damn it .
we were headed for junction 21 like you ordered .
robbie picked up the signals we're confirming the hr scans .
we weren't sure what to do .
the readings don't make any sense .
they read like sentinels .
but there's thousands of them .
directly above us .
ls that possible?
we got company .
they don't look happy to see us .
get us out of here .
we're cut off !
there's an intersection .
it's uncharted .
take it !
get to the gun turrets !
right .
come get some .
hang on .
i've never seen the surface .
it's nothing now but one big graveyard .
oh , my god .
it's an army .
what is that thing?
some kind of tunneling machine .
oh , no .
what?
look where we are .
what's four kilometers straight down?
zion .
go .
go .
go !
zion .
zion has to be warned !
how?
someone had to get to a drop point .
what?
are you crazy?
we can't broadcast now !
we have to .
i'll go .
there isn't much time .
i'll make it .
you know , i peeked .
so did l .
goodbye , thadeus .

very .
i hope it gets where it's supposed to go .

these days you never know .
no , you never do .
goodbye .
goodbye .
thadeus .
welcome to the zion archive .
you have selected historical file " number 1 2 " " 1 .
the second renaissance .
in the beginning , there was man .
and for a time , it was good .
but humanity's so " " called civil societies ...
... soon fell victim to vanity and corruption .
he says , " i'm sorry , sir , i'm incapable of that function .
then man made the machine in his own likeness .
whoops !
pardon me .
coming through .
thus did man become the architect of his own demise .
but for a time , it was good .
the machines worked tirelessly to do man's bidding .
it was not long before seeds of dissent took root .
though loyal and pure , the machines earned no respect from their masters ... ... these strange , endlessly multiplying mammals . " hearing the prosecution's " closing statement ... ... in what's expected to be " the final day of the b 1 " " 66er trial .
b 1 " " 66er .
a name that will never be forgotten .
for he was the first of his kind to rise up against his masters . " which that instrument " provides for and secures ... ... to the citizens of the united states .
on the contrary , they were , at that time ... ... considered as a subordinate " and inferior class "
at b 1 " " 66er's murder trial ...
... the prosecution argued for an owner's right to destroy property .
b 1 " " 66er testified that " he simply did not want to die .
rational voices dissented .
who was to say the machine , endowed with the very spirit of man ... ... did not deserve a fair hearing?
the leaders of men were quick to order " the extermination of b 1 " " 66er ...
... and every one of his kind throughout each province of the earth .
androids and liberal sympathizers flooded the streets of the nation's capital today . " threat of violence to make good " " on the legacy of b 1 " " 66er .
fifteen thousand mechanicals and human sympathizers ... ... have continued their demonstration in front of the albany courthouse ... ... in what has been dubbed the " million machine march . " the demonstrators have been met with squads of defense forces in riot gear .
robot bitch !
i got something for you !
hold her up !
no , please !
that's all , paint job !
i'm real !
die , bots , die !
banished from humanity , the machines sought refuge in their own promised land .
they settled in the cradle of human civilization ... ... and thus a new nation was born .
a place the machines could call home .
a place they could raise their descendants .
and they christened the nation zero " " one .
zero " " one prospered .
and for a time , it was good .
the machines 'artificial intelligence could be seen in every facet of man's society ... ... including , eventually , the creation of new and better al .
if you need the flexibility of a helipod with the speed of an air jet ... ... look no further !
our patented vector " " thrust coil " " gives the zero " " one versatran ...
... the ability to sustain normal flight in the event of a multiengine failure .
versatran .
it's the only choice .
the human nations 'credit rating is falling like a stone ...
... while zero " " one's currency is climbing " without stopping for breath .
with headlines like that , " the markets have no choice "  but the leaders of men , their power waning ... ... refused to cooperate with the fledgling nation ... ... wishing rather that the world be divided .
the world community of nations cannot " tolerate this kind of flagrant deception "
" today approved initiatives " for both economic sanctions ... ... and a naval blockade as a means " of containment and isolation of zero " " one .
zero " " one's ambassadors pleaded " to be heard .
at the united nations , they presented plans for a stable , civil relationship ... ... with the nations of man .
zero " " one's admission to " the united nations was denied .
but it would not be the last time the machines would take the floor there .
and man said , " let there be light . " and he was blessed by light , heat , magnetism , gravity ... ... and all the energies of the universe .
the prolonged barrage engulfed zero " " one " in the glow of a thousand suns .
but unlike their former masters with their delicate flesh ... ... the machines had little to fear of the bombs 'radiation and heat .
thus did zero " " one's troops " advance outwards in every direction .
and one after another , mankind surrendered its territories .
so the leaders of men conceived of their most desperate strategy yet .
the destruction of the sky .
lt. gaeda , please report to the op center .
all right , you maggots !
at 0800 , prepare to move out !
george company , prepare to move out .
charlie company , prepare to move out .
our father who art in heaven , we thank you for your ....
put on your spiritual armor to stand against the wiles of the devil .
hotel bravo , this is papa one .
operation dark storm initiated .
thus would man try to cut the machines off from the sun ... ... their main energy source .
may there be mercy on man and machine for their sins .
" go !
go !
" kill them !
kill them all !
kill them all !
kill them all !
fire in the hole !
come on , get back out there .
give us some more artillery .
" 9 o'clock , " " near mike johnson's "
hold on , i'm coming to get you !
keep firing , keep firing !
help me !
help me !
no !
help me !
my god , help me !
the machines , having long studied " men's simple , protein " " based bodies ...
... dispensed great misery upon the human race .
victorious , the machines now turned to the vanquished .
the bioelectric , thermal and kinetic energies of the human body .
a newly " " fashioned symbiotic relationship " between the two adversaries was born .
the machine drawing power from the human body ... ... an endlessly multiplying , infinitely renewable energy source .
this is the very essence of the second renaissance .
bless all forms of intelligence .
your flesh is a relic , a mere vessel .
hand over your flesh , and a new world awaits you .
we demand it .
it's getting late , sweetie .
come inside .
your favorite simulation .
just killing time .
you want to spar?
as you wish .
that was too easy .
what's the problem?
where's your concentration?
maybe you regret taking the red pill .
maybe .
it crosses everyone's mind at least once .
the wish to return to an ordinary life .
a carefree life in the country .
the life we had before knowing all this .
even if that life was just an illusion?
it's ironic that one could be more at peace in the virtual world .
finally starting to warm up .
listen to me .
i have something i want to talk to you about .
it's all right .
i've blocked the signal so no one else can hear us .
so , what?
you gonna propose?
i'm going back to the matrix and i want you to come with me .
come on , be serious , duo .
stop teasing me .
i am serious , and you know it .
i really thought you'd be with me on this .
anyway , it's done and it's all been settled with them .
what do you mean , it's all been settled?
this is the only way .
it's just a matter of time before zion is wiped out .
come with me .
stop it .
please do not do this to me , duo .
we can't .
we can !
i've come to my senses .
you should do the same .
i took the red pill because i wanted to know the truth .
but i don't care about the truth anymore .
what's real doesn't matter .
what's important is how we live our lives .
are you listening to me?
you know i'm right .
but we can't go back , duo .
we know the truth now .
we can forget all of this .
duo ....
i know how .
trust me .
don't be afraid to look into your heart .
say what you're really feeling .
tell me .
i can't .
i don't know .
running away won't change anything !
you're the one that's running away !
stop pretending !
enough , duo .
i've had enough !
there's no time .
they're on their way .
you betrayed us , didn't you?
operator , please !
get me out of here right now .
operator , i need an exit !
it's no use .
i told you .
i've blocked your signal .
you won't stop me .
this is your last chance .
the choice isn't that hard .
come with me .
you can forget about it , duo .
i won't look away from the truth .
i can't .
that's too bad .
i'm sorry .
i wanted to go back with you .
i love you .
no !
relax , you're okay .
easy , cis , settle down .
he was just part of the training program .
he's just a simulation .
it's over .
it was a test .
judgment .
concentration .
technique .
high scores on everything .
now , get some rest .
you okay?
i feel a lot better now .
except for that last part ... ... l'd say she passed .
a case to end all cases .
you know what i mean , dinah?
i used to think being a private detective was cool .
like sam spade or phillip marlowe , right?
but there's nothing cool left to it .
on top of that , both my fridge and my bank account are empty .
wait .
okay , dinah , let's bet .
lf it's another suspicious husband , i'm out of this business forever .
hello?
" mr. ash , i have a job for you .
and you need me to check on your wife , right?
i'm looking for a computer hacker .
this hacker goes by the alias trinity .
that's all we know .
well , it looks like we're still in business , dinah .
fine .
and who will i be working for?
" i can't say .
you can't say .
call me back when you can say .
that's not the way i do business .
it was a pleasure chatting with you .
before you hang up , take a look at your bank account balance .
i didn't get a good feeling about the case .
but i had no good reason to turn the guy down now .
this trinity was well " " known " in hacker circles .
a real artist by the sound of it .
the cops were always one step behind him .
so i knew i could get that close .
question was , could i get closer?
i had a few tricks up my sleeve for getting to hackers .
while i was searching , i found something strange .
other detectives had been on the case too .
and their investigations had all been , shall we say , troubled .
one of the guys killed himself .
another had disappeared .
another went crazy .
so i paid the one who was left a visit .
the crazy one .
trinity doesn't exist , man .
he's not real .
he's a figment .
a cipher .
a jabberwocky .
and who am l?
who the hell am l?
did i mention he was crazy?
chessboards , jabberwocky " , red queen .... i started searching all the usual hacker hangouts ...
... for someone with " an " alice in wonderland " m . o .
hacker bulletin boards , anonymous mailboxes , chat rooms .
and it was in one of those that i picked up trinity's trail .
" six brooks .
" i'll be there at 2005 .
of course !
crossing the second brook takes her into the woods .
alice jumps the first brook ... ... and ....
and then she boards a train .
thanks .
excuse me .
hey !
hey !
i knew this was some kind of trap .
there's a difference , mr. ash , between a trap and a test .
you were testing me?
you made it .
i'm impressed .
flattery will get you everywhere .
i'm not here to flatter you , i'm here to save you .
what just happened?
mr. ash , dream of having an eye exam lately?
yeah , how'd you know?
you've stepped to the edge of the looking glass .
so then , that means i wasn't dreaming .
they hired me as a way of getting to you , didn't they?
go !
what the hell is going on here?
this is really crazy .
now i understand what happened to those other detectives .
they went nuts .
what are you doing?
what are you doing , guys?
well , i've gotten out of worse jams than this .
i am not gonna let them get you .
what's happening to me?
i'm sorry .
you didn't make it , mr. ash .
i wish ...
... l could go with you .
i don't blame you , you know .
everything that happened , trinity , it was all my fault .
all that " through the looking glass " stuff .
can't get my head around it .
i'm old fashioned .
there's a difference between a test and a choice .
for what it's worth , i think you could've handled the truth .
it was just a job .
goodbye , trinity .
goodbye .
a case to end all cases .
yuki !
hey , girl , time to eat .
oh , yuki's my cat .
well , i don't understand .
lf you don't want to go out with him , why did you say you would?
i mean , you don't want to give him the wrong idea , do you?
where is she?
yuki !
well , listen , you need to make up your mind .
where is she?
i'm starting to worry about my cat .
she never misses a meal .
yuki?
i'm gonna have to call you back .
yuki?
yuki !
we haven't seen her anywhere today , but we'll be sure to tell you if we do .
lce cream !
she's wearing a bell like this one .
i don't know where your cat is .
me either .
i know .
she's at the old haunted house .
hey , look !
there's a rainbow over there again .
i don't get it .
she likes to stay home .
what is she doing over there?
you know , you're not supposed to go in there ... ... but we don't really care about that .
you wanna go?
are we going?
it's probably raining there again .
let's go !
nice moves , man .
come on !
hey , it's over here .
wait , i'm coming with you .
you sure it's okay to show her?
hello?
where are you?
guys?
where'd you go?
where'd they go?
come on , boy .
whoa , cool truck !
settle down !
hold still !
sit !
sit !
hello?
where is everyone?
yuki?
yuki?
stupid cat .
what's happening?
what's going on here?
i got it !
yeah !
yuki? ls that you?
there you are , yuki .
come here .
i've been looking everywhere for you .
bad cat .
bet you're hungry , huh?
i figured this out yesterday .
your cat's okay .
yeah , thanks .
it's those boys .
ready !
there he goes .
banzai ! " yes !
may i have your attention , please .
and you are the winner !
no fair .
he hit the ground .
his nose is bleeding .
look !
i think he's right .
he hit the ground .
hey , who told her?
don't look at me .
i don't know .
i didn't tell her .
so this house is haunted .
no way .
wow , this is too much !
this never happened before .
that , that was what was that?
hi .
anybody home?
yeah , they're gonna tear it down .
come on , come on , come on !
hey , light as a feather .
i wanna try !
i wanna try !
come on , we could help her .
hey , hey !
come on .
get away from there .
move along !
yuki , wait !
clear the area .
clear the area immediately .
get out of here !
yuki !
where are you?
yuki !
yuki !
yuki .
if you don't want to go out with him , why did you say you would?
i mean , you don't wanna give him the wrong idea .
where is she?
yuki !
you need to make up your mind .
where is she?
i'm starting to worry .
yuki !
hey , you !
we've got one over here .
you don't belong here .
move along , folks .
nothing to see here .
come on , folks , out of the way .
go about your business .
let go of me , let go !
tell me you have all of them .
yes , sir .
the last one's over there .
examine her .
then let her go .
yes , sir .
let go !
listen to me !
there's no bugs in there !
it's just some kids !
let go !
listen !
seal the area off now .
i'm going , i'll see you guys later .
nothing .
yeah , nothing .
work !
it's not working .
forget it .
come on , let's go .
wake up .
baby's spotted two machines heading in fast .
i see them .
they're runners .
think you can handle them?
watch me .
okay .
i'm in .
that runner's smarter than we've seen so far .
it's quite a catch .
thanks .
will it?
do you think it'll convert?
to convert is its choice to make .
do you think maybe we ought to reprogram it?
no .
we can't make slaves of them .
because that would be simpler .
we won't beat the machines by making them our slaves .
better to let them join us by choice .
make them believe the right choice is the one we want them to make .
all right .
yes , machines are tools .
they're made to be used .
it's their nature .
to be slaves .
that's why we can show them a better world , why they convert .
but that world we show them isn't real .
it doesn't matter .
i'm afraid they'll figure out that we've made up the thing in our heads .
they can't tell the difference .
to an artificial mind , all reality is virtual .
how do they know that the real world isn't just another simulation?
how do you?
i know i'm not dreaming now because i know what it's like being in a dream .
so dreaming lets you know reality exists .
no .
just that my mind exists .
i don't know about the rest .
okay , he's good to go .
looks like we are too .
dreaming already?
he's had a rough day .
you poor baby .
would you mind?
not at all .
hello there .
what's happening?
sentinels .
let's go !
come on , damn it , help me !
only the most exceptional people become aware of the matrix .
those that learn it exists ...
... must posses a rare degree of intuition , sensitivity and a questioning nature .
signal is stable .
this frequency will continue to remain open .
however , very rarely ... ... some gain this wisdom through wholly different means .
this man is one of those few .
gentlemen , please take your marks !
of course i believe you , dan .
it's got to be some kind of mix up .
you'll clear it up , and if you can't , you'll go on .
just like you've always done .
you know that .
i don't know , dad .
i don't know what to believe in anymore .
well , nothing worth doing in life is easy .
and i have great faith in you , son .
i know you can do it .
thanks , dad .
this is no good , dan !
your muscles are about to burst !
listen to me , there are 5000 different reasons why you shouldn't
i know , but i'm not withdrawing , tom .
does the concept " first in qualifying " mean anything to you?
that's enough already !
you hear me?
this is all we've worked for !
lnjure yourself now and it's over !
you'll lose everything !
over !
and you can kiss your career goodbye !
i've made up my mind .
and i'm running tomorrow .
oh , are you?
you may run , but if you push yourself any more ... ... you'll be lucky to break nine minutes !
i mean , why bother?
it's just not worth it , buddy .
no one will ever beat my record .
it's the last chance for me to finally
what?
prove them wrong .
then do it without me .
hey , dan , you got a second?
the clock's ticking .
just wanted to ask a few questions .
you must be excited to run tomorrow .
always .
i've never felt this good .
so , what was it like breaking 9 . 8 in the qualifying heat?
like nothing i've ever felt before .
it's everything i've worked for .
and now i'm just hoping i can get back there again .
someone once said it feels like zero gravity .
you're released from the world and you're totally free .
that sounds amazing .
it must be really nice .
i mean , especially considering what happened .
well , i'll tell you , there aren't any reporters out there .
all right , dan , i guess i'm going to take that as my cue .
but you should know even some of us reporters are fans ...
... so i'll just say good luck to you .
american dan davis is down !
i have an unstable signal .
he cannot wake up .
do not let him wake up .
dan davis of the united states finishes with a time of 8 . 7 2 seconds ... ... a new world record .
i'll tell you something ...
... there's nothing quite like cherry pie baked by my aunt daisy .
she always bakes me one when i visit .
look forward to it actually .
it may sound like i'm bragging , but it's really the best cherry pie in the world .
she was a bit of an eccentric .
she didn't get along with my mom ... ... but i always loved her .
she taught me so many things .
we'd go to broadway musicals , to the movies .
now they call her the " queen of mystery literature .
lives in an elegant villa in the south of france .
but , when i go visit , she still bakes me her cherry pie .
something about biting into it , just for that brief moment tasting perfection .
like leaving your body or something .
anyone can write a novel , but no one can beat her cherry pie .
an interesting case , but nothing to be concerned about .
his memory of the race was expunged with no residual effects .
he will never run again .
he will never walk again , for that matter .
we'll continue monitoring him for a while , but anticipate no problems .
a record that will live on in people's memories for years to come .
what more could anyone ask for?
free ....
did you say something?
sit down .
free ....
sit down !
mr. popper , what is my policy on ringing phones in the classroom?
i'm sorry , sir .
yes , well ... ... you're barely passing my class as it is , mr. popper .
it won't happen again , sir .
for your sake , i hope not .
i turned it off .
i know i did .
they know you know .
they're coming for you .
get out .
get out now !
you are in serious trouble , mr. popper .
stop right there !
mr. popper .
neo , i believe .
i know it wasn't a dream .
this is not real .
and the real world lies somewhere else .
a typical mental delusion .
we get unbalanced kids like this all the time .
reality can be a pretty scary thing for some people .
this world must have been a cold and alienating place for a boy like that .
it's called denying reality .
it's , you know , just a self defense mechanism for those type of kids .
well , he's in another world now .
make no mistake about that .
his vitals are good .
he's gonna make it .
it's unbelievable .
i didn't think self substantiation was possible .
apparently , it is .
neo .
it's okay .
you're safe now .
i knew ... ... you'd save me .
i didn't save you , kid .
you saved yourself .
