detective solomon .
first officer on the scene is over there .
i found some strange stuff on the tracks near the body .
i collected it before it was washed away .
i also took some pictures .
thanks .
you're the one that stopped the train?
yes , sir .
i thought it might have disturbed the physical evidence .
why not shut down grand central while you're at it , hmm?
patrolman donahue?
is that right?
donaghy .
a rookie , i take it .
no , sir .
pretty dumb .
captain?

chief murphy sent me .
ah .
good chief .
have you heard about that couple at the airport ... got in a taxi yesterday morning?
never made it home?
he don't watch the news anymore .
you used to read four papers a day , tape all the news shows .
now i just hit the rewind button .
a 3 .
things never change , paulie .
yeah , well , that was alan rubin and his wife in that taxi .
found him dead , buried , shot in the face .
hand sticking out of the ground with his wife's weddingband ... shoved on one of his fingers which was skinned to the bone .
she's still missing .
excuse me while you guys catch up , okay?
don't go too far , thelma .
we'll be letting these nice gentlemen out in 30 seconds .
sounds like you got yourself an open and shut there , paulie .
i don't think so .
a man worth several hundred million dollars ... found dead with his wife's wedding band on his mutilated hand .
what's that tell you?
the doer is saying he's got her .
he's probably contacting the family right now , making a ransom demand .
i'd have been paged if he had .
check your batteries .
it's defiinitely a ransom .
excuse me .
mr. rhyme , kenneth solomon .
i've read all your books .
scene of the crime ... at least a dozen times .
it's great to actually meet you .
where do you find these guys , paulie?
they wanna work with the best .
i guess now you're gonna ask me to ... discuss the crime scene with you , huh?
as a matter of fact , we've got a bunch of physical evidence that doesn't make sense .
some seriously weird stuff .
it's all in the report .

keep that in mind .
rhyme , i am not interested in having this conversation .

here she is now .
officer " donahoe .

donaghy .
took some terrifiic photographs , offiicer .
you know who i am?
i read your manual at the academy .
what'd you think of it?
i'm not a book critic , sir .
but you found it useful .
yeah , i guess so .
guess so .
sure you did .
i mean , you stopped that train .
photos you took .
i'd say you have a natural instinct for forensics .
so what do we got , paulie?
we have footprints , size ten , thanks to officer donaghy ... using a dollarbill to establish scale .
we have asbestos on a track bed where there shouldn't be any .
an iron bolt holding down a , uh , piece of paper .
a book page with 1 1 9 written on it .
decaying oxidation on the bolt's head but not on the thread , which says to me thatsomeone removed it from somewhere else ... and placed it there recently .
wouldn't you agree , officer?
wouldn't you agree , officer donaghy?
paulie , i'm convinced that this crime scene was staged .
perp's trying to tell us something .

uh , it's not my area .
are you being modest or are you ... a little uneasy about doing some real police work?
excuse me?
what department you work in , officer?
youth services division .
i picked her up at orientation .
ah , i see .
youth services .
i've wait listed over a year to get that transfer , and i am not gonna jeopardize
jeopardize what?
cushy deskjob?
forensics is not my area .
i disagree with you .
you can't force me to take this assignment .
i can .
and if i refuse?
i would say that you're putting your career at serious risk .
you think because of your condition you have the right to push people around?
i'm sorry .
that is truly pathetic .
truly?
you're damn right , truly .
well , forgive me , truly , if i insist on having someone with your brains and a fresh pair of eyes .
there's a life at stake here , officer .
paulie , we're gonna need some key people and some tech support .
okay?
i know the guys .
okay .
what the hell are you smiling at?
pull up a chair .
i want you to tell me everything you know about the crime scene .
basically , it's all in my report .
i read your report .
i want to know want you felt , what you feel ... in the deepest recesses of your senses .
why , you really are in love with the sound of your own voice , aren't you?
now it's your voice i'm yearning to hear .
pull up a chair .
i won't bite you .
the rifling on the . 38 slug they dug out ofthe victim ... is consistent with a webley , a very old turn of the century handgun .
thank you , kenny .
on the big board , please .
paulie , what do you got on that bolt?
there's three initials on the head n. s. g.
and the bolt's not steel .
it's iron .
lron? lron , iron .
making it old , like the webley .
officer donaghy , what do you know about asbestos?
uh , it kills hard working americans every day .
very good .
you computer literate?
a little .
thelma !
thelma?
where's my thelma?
yes .
thelma , meet amelia .
amelia , thelma .
amelia hates my books and also computers , but she's got an a plus nose for evidence .
so i want you to give her a crash course in how to access d. e. p. files .
check and see if there'sany large asbestos cleanups going on anywhere in the city , okay?
a. s. a. p.
where the hell is eddie ortiz?
i'm right here ! quepasa , paco? quepasa , eddie?
how's the world's crankiest criminalist doing?
playing beat the clock , you know?
everybody's worst nightmare .
you get into a cab , and there's a damn psycho from jersey behind the wheel .
we don't know he's from jersey .
yeah , bayonne .
it's the toxins in the water over there .
what'd you do?
bring the whole lab with you?
mama told me " be prepared .
where do you want this shit?
over here in the corner .
how is your mother?
oh , god .
she's 76 , and she's schtupping some guy named morris .
god bless her .
but it's morris the schtarker i'm worried about .
he's 79 with a tricky ticker and an active pecker .
hey .
afternoon .
captain cheney .
amelia , what do yougot on that asbestos?
there's about a dozen cleanups scattered about the five boroughs .
put it up on the viewer for me , will you , please?
see if you can narrow it down to the oldest location as soon as you can .
how're you doing , howard?
fine , thank you .
how's it going?
in the middle of the middle , as you can see .
mm hmm .
hey , linc , look what i found on the threading of that bolt .
huh .
i was hoping to grab a minute with you , if you don't mind .
excuse me , howard .
oh .
sorry , sorry .
we got officer donaghy here to thank for photographing the crucial evidence .
crucial evidence?
we don't know that .
listen , linc , i just stopped by to make sure you had all the support you need .
as you know , i'm putting the full resources of my department at your ... disposal .
and i appreciate it , howie .
thankyou .
but the thing is , linc , you see , i've formalized the department's standard procedures since you were in charge , so
eddie , could you put what you got up on my screen , please?
so i'd appreciate it if you kept me in the loop .
absolutely .
at all times .
at all eddie , what the hell is that we're looking at?
uh , oldpaper .
coarsegrade .
i'd say , uh , 80 , 90 years old .
turn of the century , it looks like .
huh .
the perp likes old .
uh , fine , then .
look , i'll be in my office if you need me .
yeah , okay , howard .
good .
old paper .
old gun .
buries his victim in a vintage civil war railroadbed .
sand .
sand , sand .
what eddie , what do you got on the sand?
doesn't really look like sand .
i'm not sure .
can you individuate it?
oh , if i had an e. d. x. here , i could do anything .
we don't have a goddamn " e " the fuck " x , " eddie !
oh , look who forgot their chill pill this morning .
excuse me .
come on .
i'm all over this thing now .
okay , we're talking , uh , pearly looking .
some kind of a ... shellfish or something .
oyster shells maybe?
could be .
definitely .
if i had to bet on it , i'd say it was .
sure .
allright , i got it .
the oldest asbestos sites are coming up .
in 1913 when the woolworth building was being built , workmen found the body of this rich industrialist , talbot soames .
he'd been kidnapped the year before , shot in the head and buried .
and what they thought was white sand turned out to be oyster ... shells .
crushed oyster shells .
that's what they used as landfill in lower manhattan .
that's how pearl street got its name .
that's where mrs. rubin's gonna be .
somewhere downtown .
she's gonna be underground .
she's gonna be in a basement ... near ... or in the woolworth building .
hey , paulie .
call emergency services unit .
have them meet us down by the woolworth building .
tell them to start their search .
maybe we'll get lucky .
okay?
eddie .
did you bring your van?
yeah .
uh , it's downstairs .
we're gonna need it .
throw your keys to amelia .
paulie , you and solomon go with her .
shouldn't i go with them?
no, you gotta stay here with me .
we gotta work that bolt .
that's the missing piece .
shall we keep cheney in the loop?
fuck him .
fuck him .
amelia .
trust me .
follow those instincts you were born with .
i'll be with you ... every step of the way .
jesus , 25 minutes left .
how did rhyme get to be that way?
he was born brilliant .
it happens .
i mean the physical part .
about four years ago , he was working the body of a transit cop ... been found shot in a subway tunnel .
beam came down , damn near cut him in half .
jesus .
family?
married sister in phoenix .
he never sees her .
cut himself off .
technically , he's still on active duty , collecting full pay .
p. b. a. insurance picks up round the clock care and all the gadgets .
on weekends , always one or two cops there lending a hand .
tough deal winding up like that .
you won't hear him complaining .
nah , he gets too much pleasure pushing other people's buttons .
in your case , i'd be complimented .
you gotta learn to relax around a compliment , especially one from rhyme .
you can be a little grating .
me?
kiddo , if you were any more wound up , you'd be a timex .
he was a human dynamo writing books ,
lecturing all over the world , giving expert opinion in trials , working half the crime scenes in the city .
you know what he'd do in his downtime?
i can't imagine .
he'd collect things dirt , metals , plastics , hubcaps , plants , musical strings , medical tools , anything you could think of .
obsessive .
no , he'd have it all analyzed and catalogued ... for his what cha call it database .
jesus christ !
i'd like to get there in one piece , if possible .
new york security gate company .
start looking through those?
that might be good .
what else?
nicholas steven gerard .
elevator construction .
gotta be underground .
i got a subway builder .
sounds
excuse me !
n. s. g. niagra steam generation .
bought by eastern gas and electric in 1 928 .
the six inch iron bolt was used mainly for steam pipe assemblies .
no .
no .
349, you got 11 minutes left .
where are you?
we just hit the financial district .
there's a steam junction ... with big asbestos coated pipes .
that's where our victim's gonna be .
i'd bet my legs on it .
she's gonna be at wall and nassau .
wall and nassau .
has e. s. u. been notifiied?
they're on their way .
they'll probably get there before you .
e. s. u. says that steam is released through that junction every day at 4 : 00 p . m .
shit , what's this asshole up to?
i don't know , but it's gonna happen in about ten minutes and thirty seconds .
all right , linc , we're here .
we're going down there .
amelia?
yeah , i'm here .
it's their job to try and save mrs. rubin's life .
it's your job to get ready and ... work the crimescene , if necessary .
there's some things you're gonna need .
look in the back of the truck , and you'll see an aluminium suitcase and a radio headset .
see it?
yeah , i see them .
there must be a way in .
what's the problem here?
fuckin 'valves freeze up easy .
come on , guys .
shut it off .
you there?
i'm here .
i'm inside the pipe .
go !
i hear something !
i hear something !
what is that?
someone's in there !
i can hear her crying .
everyone , quiet now !
shut all the valves down .
mrs. rubin?
mrs. rubin?
she's in there , linc .
mrs. rubin , we're on our way in now !
come on , guys .
let's go , let's go .
let's hurry the fuck up .
get drill and a tap .
somebody cut this thing halfway through .
there's no way to turn that steam off , guys .
back !
back !
paulie?
paulie?
linc , she's gone .
the whole place is scalded in steam .
let's go !
this way !
let's go !
this way ! ... is in some way e. s. u. are gonna blow a hole in the subbasement wall .
there's no other way in .
it's my understanding ...
i'm working with chief murphy's authorization on this , right?
yeah , that's right .
i don't want those emergency services guys rushing in there , trampling the evidence before we get a chance to run the scene .
what do you want?
when they blow the hole , i want donaghy to go in first .
hey , come on , linc .
she's not trained for this .
we could get our asses in a sling .
my ass has been in a sling for four years .
tell hanson and his beasts that's what i want .
period .
allright .
you got it .
okay , let's move !
all the pipes in the junction have been secured .
right .
check all the way to broadway .
i'm doing this under protest , sellitto .
the perp could still be in there , for christ's sake .
rhyme's in charge , and they're his orders .
you can't handle it in there , i want you to get your ass out .
amelia , you ready?
yeah .
listen to me .
i'm with you every step of the way .
go on .
good luck .
i'm in .
tell me what you see .
everything's been boiled to hell .
oh , god .
what is it?
it's an awful smell .
that means you're close .
i can't believe i'm doing this .
you're fine .
just fine .
you're doing great .
now just remember the academy .
when you walk , move in a straight line .
we don't want to disturb any footprints he might 've left .
yeah , assuming he's gone .
there's no footprints .
there's nothing yet .
oh , god .
what?
talk to me .
talk to me , amelia .
i can see her .
the steam pipe was opened , and she's tied down right in front of it .
okay .
there's nothing you can do about that now .
you can't do anything for her but help her by ... working the crime scene ; that's your job .
open your suitcase .
get your camera .
i can't do this .
you can do it .
yes , you can .
yesterday you stopped a train .
you can do anything you want when you put your mind to it .
don't work me , rhyme .
just tell me what to do next .
very slowly , walk the grid ... one foot in front of the other .
i want you to look around you now .
remember , crime scenes are three dimensional .
floors , wall sand ceilings .
rhyme .
yeah , i'm here .
there's something strange .
things he left for us?
yes .
ln a cluster again?
there's a small piece of wood ... and , uh , looks like some hair .
all right , i'm gonna walk you through collecting the evidence .
you do everything exactly as i say .
oh, jesus .
talk to me .
it's a bloody bone .
where is it?
it's in my fucking hand .
human?
i think so , yeah .
all right .
photograph it .
bag it .
okay , that's it .
i'm outta here .
one more thing .
we gotta process the body .
wha i'm not a medical examiner .
i can't do that .
i'm not asking you to do an autopsy .
i just want you to
just describe the restraints .
okay .
they're strange looking handcuffs .
they look more like old shackles or something .
there's a chain , uh , across her waist .
and her feet are , uh , are bound with a rope .
hands above her head?
yeah .
there's also a large , uh , a piece of flesh ... missing from her right forearm .
it's right down to the bone .
it looks like it was surgically removed .
this is what i want you to do .
we're gonna need those handcuffs , amelia .
it's probably our best chance for good prints .
the m. e. can remove them when they get here .
m. e. is all thumbs .
they're
they'll mess up the prints .
look in the suitcase .
there's a small saw .
okay .
i want you to saw her hands off at the wrist line .
we gotta have those cuffs for prints .
i can't .
cut her hands off .
we need the handcuffs .
i can't .
no .
saw off her hands .
take off the cuffs .
i can't .
listen to me .
saw off her we need those cuffs .
i can't !
amelia , we need  no !
fuck you !
amelia .
amelia .
he wants the woman's hands cut off , he can come and do it himself .
amelia?
amelia .
amelia .
that'll be 16 . 50 .
hello?
who is it?
hello?
jesus .
hey , hey , take it easy !
shit !
solomon , what are you doing?
are you okay?
what the fuck are you doing?
rhyme's been trying to call you for hours .
your phone's down .
he was concerned .
my phone's fine .
i don't need his concern .
he needs you over to his place right away .
well , i don't work for lincoln rhyme .
rhyme believes the evidence you collected is telling him there's another vic in play .
and he is laying that at my feet?
hey .
don't shoot the messenger .
you just move in?
uh, yeah , about ayearago .
really?
you were a model .
yeah , when i was a kid .
kid model to street cop .
there's a leap .
for whatever it's worth ,
i thought what you did today was pretty damn terrific .
hey , you guys , i'm outta here .
i'm gonna grab a cab .
i've got a paper to finish .
i'm just gonna hang .
no problem .
i'll be there in a minute .
can i finish that?
go for it .
i'll see you outside .
taxi .
that bone's definitely not human .
and the hair?
not human either .
well , what is it?
i'm workin 'fast as i can .
glad to see you could join us .
i got cheney on the line .
he wants you to brief him .
tell him i'll call him back .
first , you did a hell of a job locating the evidence .
there's no question the perp knows forensics .
now , as for the other thing , the , uh you know , the victim's hands , well , maybe , um maybe it was too much to handle , so we'll just forget it .
is that your version of an apology?
an apology?
is that why you came over here?
you really are a piece of work .
well , aren't we a pair .
i think you're terrific .
you got a hell of an arrest record too .
high marks from all your bosses .
definite goldshield potential .
why do you want to throw it all away to chase youth offenders?
i don't feel i have any need to explain that to you .
come on , amelia , cop to cop .
cop to cop , let's just leave it at personal reasons .
okay .
doesn't have anything to do with your father , does it?
man , you just keep charging at walls , don't you?
stubbornness is something we both share .
you know , they say , genetically speaking , that we come into this world with a preordained destiny .
i don't believe it , though .
for example , my parents .
neither of them had more than an eighth grade education , never read more than one book between them , not one .
i've read thousands .
i've written a dozen .
what's your point?
my point ... is that destiny is what you make it .
whatever happened to your father doesn't mean it's gonna happen to you .
you're a great cop .
you'll make a terrific detective .
it's a gift .
don't throw it away .
a report from the taxi commission .
an nyu student was abducted late last night .
his girlfriend saw him struggling to get out as the taxi driver ... was bludgeoning him with a flashlight .
no description of the driver .
okay , everybody , this could be our next victim .
yeah , tony .
paulie here .
it looks like we got another victim .
did you get a deadline off that evidence yet?
not yet .
something i was hoping you'd help me with .
no !
no !
no !
anyone for some osso buco?
what?
the bone we found at the wall street scene veal shank .
braised and overly salted to boot .
a cow bone?
uh huh .
and i also found a piece of that old paper ... embedded in the bone .
take a look .
what's going on?
just do what you need to do as quickly as possible .
this came in from the f. b. i. it's about the hair follicles .
he says they're not human .
a rodent , probably a rat .
get this they were shaved off .
now we're looking for a rat that shaves .
i really like that .
i've known a few in my time .
how about you , amelia?
more than a few .
it's consistent with underground , that's for sure , huh?
what's he trying to say to us?
defiinitely communicating in our language .
leaving clues .
forensic clues , at that .
maybe it's a cop .
maybe .
maybe he's trying to share the responsibility of these murders with us .
if we don't figure out the clues in time , the blood's on our hands .
and if we don't find the victim in time , we're as responsible for the murders as he is .
what do you got on that dirt you scraped from the wood?
i don't have it 100 percent individuated , but it does appear nitrogen rich .
all set .
ready to rock and roll .
thanks for rushing , man .
allright , thelma .
thankyou , richard .
nitrogen rich .
explosive carbons .
where do you find those in new york?
bomb sites .
shooting ranges .
maybe an old fort or an armory .
let's not forget the shit factor , guys .
the what?
manure becomes a nitrate when it's aged .
that's true .
and you got cow bones , huh?
old cow bones , old manure .
turn of the century .
cows , farms , pastures , rats .
dead cows .
where do you find in stockyards .
slaughterhouses that's what we wanna look for .
stockyards and slaughterhouses from turn of the century .
let's start there .
check the internet .
okay , i want tax records , sanitation records ... and building code inspections , last hundred years , okay?
your blood pressure is way up .
you're pushing it too hard , rhyme .
i understand , thelma .
what do we got on the stockyards over there?
almost there .
you okay?
no , i'm not okay .
i can't figure out this damn time line ... or these shards of cardboard .
i don't know what the hell it means .
uh, yeah .
we got three defunct stockyard sites .
there's one on the east side .
lexington and the harlem river viaduct .
good .
solomon , put the box down .
mark it down on the viewer as she calls them off .
your blood pressure's gonna blow a gasket if you don't slow down .
my body has a mind of its own .
it doesn't listen to me , all right?
what else , amelia?
yeah , there's another on the hudson up at 155th .
mark it down , solomon .
look , your stats are going down .
you saw him have a seizure the otherday .
what else?
there's one underground at greenwich and houston .
mark it down , solomon .
why don't you knock it off , linc?
i don't need to knock it off !
wh what was the first one that you mentioned?
lexington and the harlem river viaduct .
and when did it close?
1910 .
okay , what about , uh houston and greenwich?
when is that?
uh , 1898 .
and hudson and 155th was closed in 1906 .
1906 , 1898
all right .
let's 1898 .
houston and greenwich .
call emergency services , paulie .
tell 'em ... meet us at houston and greenwich , okay?
solomon , get on to hanson .
he'll need about 20 guys .
you go with them .
come on , guys !
let's go !
linc , you there?
yeah .
ready .
we're here .
okay .
amelia?
yeah .
all right .
same drill .
i want you in first .
let's do it .
you watch yourself , amelia .
man , i don't like this .
i don't like this .
linc , i got a bad feeling about this , man .
i think all three of us ought to get in there together .
not yet , paulie .
just hold back .
i'm going down some stairs .
cement walls .
woodcrates .
large columns .
smells like manure down here .
ortiz sure knows hiss hit , huh?
always has .
metal hooks ... and a pen .
it's a slaughterhouse .
come on , guys .
go , go , go , go !
e. s. u. are here .
you hold 'em off .
don't want 'em contaminating the scene .
hold it .
hold up , hold up !
you're not to go in .
why?
rhyme's orders .
fuck him !
get me cheney on the line .
crimescene c. o. on air .
switch to channel 22 for e. s. u. fuck rhyme .
maybe this one's still alive .
perp didn't leave a deadline .
what does that mean?
it means we're probably too late .
you don't know that , rhyme .
get off the line .
just move on , amelia .
you know , there's five basic contaminants to every crime scene .
i'll skip to the worst one other cops .
i think i hear something .
i hate this shit .
i see something .
something's there .
i think i found him .
i i can't tell if he's alive .
oh , geez .
he's covered in rats .
they're all over him .
we're goin 'in .
no , you're not .
no , you're not !
go , go !
central , we have shots fired .
shots fired .
oh , god .
you were right .
we never had a shot .
he cut him up pretty bad and left him for the rats .
there's also a big cut in his leg .
it's right down to the bone .
the blood attracted the rats .
goddamn son of a bitch .
you okay?
i'm fine .
you wanna step aside so i can walk the grid?
yeah .
yeah .
all right .
let's back 'em up .
let's give her some room .
move it , guys .
rhyme , i'm gonna walk the grid .
okay .
you know what to do .
rhyme , i found it .
another cluster .
it's a piece of old paper , just like the other two .
and a matchbox .
will somebody get that black suitcase and bring it over here , please?
pull out the brown envelope .
sounds like you're starting to enjoy this work .
damn !
the press is here .
right there , right there .
lincoln rhyme is no longer working this case .
i'm takin 'over .
understood?
do what you wanna do , captain , but maybe you ought to check with murphy first .
fuck murphy and fuck rhyme .
this has been cleared downtown .
we got a dead kid in there .
i , for one , am not taking the heat for that .
you understand , hmm?
call ortiz .
tell him and his crew to vacate rhyme's place now .
excuse me , but the victim was already dead when we arrived .
and you , half assed patrolman working a crime scene , those days are over .
i'll take that evidence bag now , thankyou .
you can take it with a chain of custody voucher , sir .
are you outta your mind?
cheney says he wants all the evidence .
hmm?
let's go .
you're coming with us .
what , are you arresting me?
just get in the car and keep your mouth shut to the press .
you're not gonna find any prints .
the guy's too good for that .
well , it looks like we have a nice , clean friction print here .
unless , of course , it's yours .
no .
i was wearing gloves when i collected it .
we'll know soon enough .
put this through , highest priority .
you got it .
thank you .
hey , you know , i got a feeling this perp's been in business a long time .
yeah , i hear you , but that's cheney's problem now .
yeah , that's what scares me .
do me a favor , will you?
check and see if there's been any homicides in the last 12 months ... involving surgically removed flesh exposing bone .
no problem .
i'll see you soon .
hope so , eddie .
hey , thelma?
don't you let him run no circles around you now .
stay right , eddie .
oh , that print .
we just got a positive i. d. on it .
the guy has three extremely violent priors .
oh , look at that .
taxi license , no less .
we got him .
let's go , boys !
somebody call e. s. u.
now slide out nice and easy .
that explains your print , captain .
he's now the fourth victim of a killing spree ...
that has prompted nypd brass to launch a taskforce ... to track the killer .
this morning's raid follows leads found in one of the earlier murder sites .
hey !
hey .
i was hoping you'd show up .
he's been worried about you . ... lincoln rhyme .
yeah , sure .
viewers will know rhyme from his book , scene of the crime , a chronicle of old new york's most grisly murders hey .
i didn't expect to see you again .
poor cheney , huh?
grabbed the ball with both hands and scored one for the other team .
i can't comment at this time yeah .
i tried to warn him that the perp was too smart to leave a print .
how you doin 'with that stuff?
not too good .
two pieces of the puzzle , but i don't know what it means .
maybe this'll help .
cheney will have your badge for that .
he wouldn't give me a chain of custody voucher , so what could i do?
you could bring it back to him .
the man is a living monument to ineptitude .
true .
let's take a look .
what do you got there?
ah !
third piece of the puzzle .
there's something really strange about it .
you gotta smell it .
sure .
are you oh , shoot .
sorry .
it's okay .
take your time .
okay .
you have to put it closer to my nose .
what do you think it is?
kerosene?
possibly .
this just came in from eddie ortiz .
amelia , could you load these into the viewer , please?
shit !
sorry about that , thelma .
e. c. u. view scan .
i'm enclosing photos of four unsolved homicides ...
which took place in the last 12 months .

if he does , he won't be happy .
what what are you talking about?
he's already finalized arrangements to self terminate .
he's convinced some doctor friend to help ... with his " final transition , " as he calls it .
but suicide?
i mean it's the seizures .
any one of'em could put him into a vegetative state .
that's what he fears more than anything .
who is it?
captain cheney !
what can i help you with?
police business .
open up , please .
mr. rhyme is asleep .
well , wake him up .
i need to see him now .
let me deal with this asshole cheney .
you watch him .
anything , just call me .
he's all right .
look , lady .
now , i hope you know that obstructing justice is a felony offense .
look , don't " lady " me .
and i know my rights .
unless you have a warrant , you can't come in .
i'm comin'in .
i have reason to believe there's stolen evidence on these premises .
now , what's your full name , hmm?
thelma what?
you want to get official , huh?
what did you say your name was?
allright .
i'm not here to play the name game , honey .
you got a smart mouth , and it's gonna get you in trouble one day .
yeah , and it also may bite your ass ifyou don't stop trying to aggravate my patient .
i'm gonna leave now , but i'll be back .
and when i come back , it'll be with a warrant .
i looked everywhere , and i thought the conductor was gonna be so angry .
i kept on searching everywhere , and finally it was right on my lap .
grandma can't wait to see you .
what'd i do?
first off , you're carrying a fare and your meter's not on .
number two , your license is not displayed
there's laws against molesting the handicapped , you know .
yeah?
i wasn't a pretty sight , was i?
thelma told me about your plans for your " final transition .
cop to cop , that subject's not open to discussion .
why , would you miss me?
well , destiny's what we make it , right?
touche .
you seem to have your reasons for checking out .
i just i would've expected more from someone like you .
well , i might surprise you and ... live forever .
nothing you could do would surprise me , rhyme .
well !
look who's still in the land of the living .
for the moment .
cheney was here , huffin 'and puffin '.
promised to return with a warrant .
sorry i missed him .
if that's him , tell him i'm , uh ...
say no more . skiing .
hello?
oh , hey , paulie .
hang on .
linc , i don't know if this is anything more than a coincidence , but a taxi inspector was killed today by a cabbie who was off the meter .
thing about this taxi , a witness a male , who wouldn't give his name saw the taxi speeding away with an old man and a little girl inside .
probably the doer that called .
jesus , he's got a kid .
and an old man .
thankyou , paulie .
okay .
we better take a closer look at that third piece of the puzzle .

lincoln , it was the last murder in the book .

check the pilings under the pier .
found them !
over here !
here !
here !
central , i can see someone with a light signaling us ... from the old staten island ferry pier .
there appears to be two bodies in the water next to the pilings .
subject signaling is most likely nypd officer at the site .

you think he's gonna kill a cop?
could be .
thelma .

they called it an investigation .
it was a witch hunt .
there was a forensics cop up in syracuse , new york
marcus andrews .
okay , yeah , that was the cop that was ... suspected of tampering with evidence in some homicide cases , right?
nothing was tampered with .
six innocent people went to jail ; one hung himself .
no , no , no .
they went to jail because they were guilty , they were scum .
he doctored the serology reports .
no , nothing was doctored .
he planted blood evidence at the crime scenes .
my work was impeccable .
where we going with this ...
marcus?
your report destroyed my life .
you know my report was not a legal finding .
you never gave me the opportunity to defend myself .
i never even met you .
i was sent to prison for six years .
i spent two more years trying to get to you .
do you know what happens to a cop in jail?
every day , every single day , over and over , i was brutalized .
i became a human toilet , because of your expert opinion .
well , you will never point the finger of blame at anyone ever again .
