what are you doing here?
you should have stayed home with your wife .
why did you come here?
we can handle this .
you know me when duty calls count me in .
nobody moves !
this is the police .
stay here !
put your hands up .
turn around .
you have the right to remain silence .
anything you say ...
sir , you have a call .
sir , you're hit .
don't mind me go after him .
it's dark and besides he's already gone .
sir , your wife's in the hospital .
it was transmitted through our radio .
i'm sorry sir but you can't go in there .
doctor !
your wife and your baby's condition is critical .
the condition has speed up .
but don't worry , we'll do our best to help them .
thank you !
doc?
good news they're all right .
congratulations .
it's a boy .
thank you .
but we still need to put him in an incubator .
it's ok !
it's ok !
we can't put perfecto rialino with other kids .
mrs. compiones , this is only a public elementary school !
and our teacher are not trained to teach disabled kids like your son .
ma'am my son is not disabled .
you have to face it .
autism is a form of disability .
i'm sorry for the term .
but you have to admit that your son is not normal .
autism is only a state of the mind .
he has talents and you just have to be patient with him .
there is a special school in manila that teaches special kids like your son .
it is very expensive to send him there .
we don't have the money for that .
i'm begging you .
let him finish this school year .
his advisers can't give him instructions anymore .
when he gets mad , he hurt his classmates .
we can't handle him anymore .
i'll watch him everyday in school .
if you just allow me .
but flor ...
ma'am bullet needs your help .
how can he learn things about life?
if we don't include him with other normal kids .
i'm sorry .
i really can't help you .
good day .
bullet let's go .
you're the best
no one can beat me .
you better practice some more .
hey , look it's bullet .
you should beat him .
who?
that one?
he's nothing .
he can't beat me .
you can call anyone if you like .
you're such a braggart !
bullet , come , let's go play .
mom , can i go play?
i don't have school tomorrow .
you can play but go home early .
yes , mom .
let's go .
let him use the broken one .
beat him bullet .
he's such an airhead .
here , use this .
bullet is so good .
bullet , you won !
you're the best !
this is two
two plus three ... equals five ...
bullet , i'll cook you fired chicken .
if you can count this .
you'll cook fried chicken if i counted the drawings?
yes , but first count the drawings .
ok , mom .
this is two ... one ... two .
this is three .
once upon a time there was a great and brave warrior .
he was a giant .
when he saw young david he insulted and asked him .
do you think you can beat me with just a spear?
come here and i'll feed you to the birds and animals .
david answered i may only have my spear .
but i'll beat you in the name of the lord yahweh the god of israel .
with his powers i'll beat you .
he brought the giant's head to jerusalem .
bullet wake up .
ok .
bullet wake up .
it's late .
bullet .
ok .
bullet .
my son , come with me .
i have something to show you .
i told you ...
i told you .
stop talking to yourself .
no one is talking with you .
bullet .
stop it .
yes , dad .
i still have the touch .
check how many bulls eye i've made .
mayor , you've hit nothing .
damn you !
do you want me to shoot you?
mayor , you really didn't hit anything .
you go take a look .
i think he's blind .
mayor !
pal !
how's the practice?
well , i told them to check how many bulls eye that i've hit .
he really didn't hit anything .
there's really nothing .
i think there's something wrong with this gun .
he should just use a blowgun .
he should just use a slingshot .
i've used that last night mayor .
it's a good gun .
damn you !
just remember this !
don't talk unless i ask you to .
pal , mayor , about the thing that we've talked ...
let's try my godson .
bullet , show him what you've got .
of course .
show me what you've got .
show me .
ok .
whoa !
watch it !
bullet .
bullet .
what have i told you?
you know i always remind him about how to use a gun .
i noticed that .
i always remind him .
bullet , go on .
what?
what will i shoot?
that ... that one .
hit is in between the eyes .
right in between .
ouch !
ouch !
bullet !
it's too loud !
you almost hit my shoes .
i'm sorry .
you know that he's ...
my ears hurt .
give me that .
my ears hurt .
do it again .
don't be afraid .
don't be afraid .
go on .
you hear him?
don't be afraid .
wait , you know him his ears are sensitive .
he freaks out when he hears loud noise .
bullet , hit it here .
hit it in between the eyes .
here , here .
what?
hit it right here .
wait ... here , wear this .
you should hit it in the middle .
where?
here?
yes .
yes , godfather .
you can do it .
you can do it .
yeh !!
you're the best , bullet .
he's good .
we can use his talent .
go on , do it again .
hit it again in the middle .
i will .
always hit it there .
it looks like he just got lucky .
i thought he was really good .
he just got lucky .
wait , i have a feeling .
come here .
hey , wait !
i'd better take this .
i don't trust you .
my guess is right .
all his shot hit the same target .
his talent is extra ordinary .
we can make use of him with his talent .
sure , but i must teach him first how to use a gun properly .
look at you .
up to now i still can't believe that you're the town's mayor .
just wait when i become the president of our country .
that's what i'm telling you .
you're full of foolishness .
what foolishness?
remember when we're still in the force?
i don't remember you do anything good .
all you do is fooling around .
look who's talking .
it is as if you are telling the truth .
if someone hears you .
they'll think what you're saying is true .
do you want me to name it one by one?
name what?
remember when you eloped with maring?
that's not maring .
it's clara .
that's enough !
i came here because of this .
here .
this is a huge competition in manila .
the prize is big money .
flor will not agree with this .
i don't agree in what you're saying .
your son's talent is extra ordinary .
extra ordinary?
what are you thinking about?
you should think about our son's safety .
teaching your son how to use a gun?
you know that he's a ...
he's a what?
flor , his talent is not ordinary .
i don't agree in what you are saying .
he's our son a son of a policeman .
it's just right for him to know how to protect himself and others as well .
what if something goes wrong?
if guns are used in the wrong way that's the time when people are in danger .
you're just using your son to fulfill your own dreams .
flor , don't forget he's a campiones .
i'll prove to them that i'm not a failure .
our son will give honor to our name .
if he wins the crown .
bullet don't !
ok .
i allowed you to join the contest .
only because i know that sports is good for you .
and also that's what your father dreams .
for you to win the crown and give honor to our town .
but remember this .
never use the gun to kill people .
do you understand?
yes , mom .
i love you so much !
i love you so much !
i love you too , mom .
i'm hungry now .
we'll eat then .
always be a good boy .
flor that's enough , we'll miss the bus .
pal !
pal !
i just want to see bullet before he leaves .
to wish you good luck
i'll drive you to the bus station .
thank you .
don't worry we will not fail our town .
flor we have to go .
we're coming .
i'm just making sure that bullet has everything he needs .
bullet !
remember what i've told you .
peping watch your son .
bullet !
always remember to say your prayers .
don't forget to pray .
bullet , good luck !
peping give my regards to elly .
don't forget to pray .
dad , why is there a tv inside the bus?
only houses should have tv .
why is there a tv inside the bus?
bullet , you know ...
it's for the passengers not to get bored during the trip .
that's is why .
bullet , my son .
always remember everything what
i've taught you about holding a gun when you are in the competition .
i will .
so you won't get disqualified .
do you understand me?
yes , daddy .
dad what does it mean ,
you have the right to remain silent "?
it's in the law .
that an arrested person should know his rights .
cops like me should not just shoot the criminals .
dad , you know what?
you're like me .
you get astonished when someone's talking to you .
you go to sleep now .
bullet !
mom !
they're here .
we're here already .
go greet your aunt elly .
yes , dad .
greet her a good afternoon .
okay .
peping !
bullet !

she's asking how are you .
hey , mon's asking how are you .

hurry .
i'll show you something .
come in .
how's flor doing?
she stayed at home .
besides , we'll just be gone for two days .
come here bullet .
you two , be careful .
and don't teach bullet anything nasty .
bullet , you behave .
mom , don't worry .
i'll take care of him .
put your bag down .
take a sit .
it amazes me how ray can talk to bullet .
i don't know either .
i have been with bullet for thirty years
and up to now i still find it hard to talk to him .
i heard that the prize is big money .
it is .
that's why flor allowed bullet to join .
we can save that money for his schooling .
just wait here !
i'll show you something .
here !
look !
so many beautiful women .
what's with you?
what's wrong?
wait !
don't fight it .
don't fight it .
bullet , wait !
what's happening here?
he slammed the door on his hand .
bullet , let me see your hand .
oh yes !
just like your father .
i'm so worried about your case , you know .
but in a way ... have your mother received the package?
don't worry .
now , richie .
from here , you stay over the night .
is that a problem?
no , we're looking for a container van .
what's in it?
it contains sports cars .
maybe i can help you here , but ...
can you give me any proof?
so i could start looking for it .
yeah .
i know someone here .
his wife is a filipina .
i have the address .
i'm willing to give thirty million pesos .
30 million pesos?
thank you so much in the name of god .
amen .
did you see that ray?
bullet prays before eating .
i do pray , too .
eat well .
elly , may i ask ... when is bob coming home?
he'll be coming home next week .
i told him not to extend his contract in taiwan .
bullet , why not stay here until next week?
so that you can see my father .
why not .
these two barely see each other and you're only staying for 2 days .
that's impossible .
we told flor that we'd only be gone for 2 days .
are you ready for tomorrow , bullet?
you'd better sleep early .
