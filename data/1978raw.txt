another year , a brand new diary .
once again i was summoned , kicking and screaming , to my mother's turkey curry buffet , where i've had some of the most shaming experiences of my life .
hello , darling .
lovely to see you .
it was , as usual , crammed full with some of the most dangerous perverts in the uk , disguised as close , personal friends of my parents .
hello , bridget .
hello , una .
oh , no , thanks .
love the jumper .
i prefer what's underneath it .
uncle geoffrey !
hello , gorgeous .
hello .
hello , darling .
hello , dad .
how's it going?
i wish i was dead .
but this year , there was one crucial difference .
nice jumper .
my mother's taste never falters .
never .
you always wonder how it's going to work out at the end of the story .
marla and captain von trapp ,
snow white and the seven dwarfs ,
mark darcy and bridget jones .
i've found my happy ending at last .
and nothing in the world can spoil it .
well , almost nothing .
bridget jones , what the fuck are you doling?
i , i can't see anywhere soft to land .
how about on your arse?
bridget , unless you want to get sacked at 6, 000 feet , you will be on your way in exactly three seconds .
three , two , one ... cue bridget .
a dangerous bane to the countryside and emergency services , or a safe and exhilarating hobby?
well ... let's see , shall we?
go .
jump .
for christ s sakes , go !
she's out .
unit two , you got her?
we see her .
bridget , open the chute .
open it .
open your fucking parachute !
pull the thingy or you will die !
oh .
honestly , you forget just one teeny , weeny detail and everyone treats you like an idiot .
# nobody does it better
# makes me feel sad for the rest
# nobody does it
# half as good as you
# baby , baby
# darling , you're the best
# baby , you're the best ...
where was i?
oh , yes ...
mark darcy .
what happens after you walk off into the sunset?
bridget?
earth to bridget sodding jones .
bridget , you're on .
you're live .
well , this is bridget jones for sit up britain , reporting to you from a big vat of excrement .
give me a close up of the porker .
who cares about the odd professional hiccup?
i've been in a functional relationship with an adult male for six wonderful weeks , four fabulous days and seven precious hours .
or to put it another way , 71 ecstatic shags .
he's given up being snooty , and i've given up smoking .
# loving you ...
well , he thinks i have anyway , which is practically the same thing . # ... a dream come true ...
mark darcy is perfect .
not a fuckwit , alcoholic , workaholic , pervert or megalomaniac , but total sex god and human rights lawyer .
he is a miracle , really .
bridget , will you stop?
stop staring at me .
go and find something to do .
sorry .
# la la la la la ...
so , as you can see , the incredible truth is the wilderness years are over .
bridget jones is a love pariah no more .
morning , bridget .
late again .
yes .
sorry .
i was in bed with my boyfriend .
he's a human rights lawyer , you know .
yes , we know .
i cannot believe how fantastic shagging was last night .
maybe i'll ring him .
no , no ...
obviously it's important to tell one's boyfriend how nice he looks naked , but i have crucial , pulitzer prize winning journalism to do .
hello?
it's me .
just wondered how you are .
i'm fine , thanks .
everything all right with you?
fine , though , er ...
i've just had a rather graphic shag flashback .
and you do have a genuinely gorgeous bottom .
thank you .
i'm with the mexican ambassador , the head of amnesty international and the undersecretary for trade and industry .
and you're on speakerphone .
oh .
right , well ...
i'm quite busy with important stuff too ...
bridget , we're waiting for that tape about tom , the happy hamster .
i'll call when i've finished .
excellent .
and richard wants to see you about that crap skydiving report .
oh , fuck .
oh , dear .
is this the end of my career?
no , it can't be .
i will fight this .
i am a journalist of the highest standards and integrity .
this is bridget jones reporting from a big vat of excrement .
look , i never said i could skydive and i'm terrified of heights ,
so it was really hard to concentrate .
be quiet .
they loved it upstairs .
loved it .
and they want us to come up with another regular spot for you .
oh , my god .
that's ...
i won't let you down , richard .
precisely . ... my friends 'motto was " when in rome , do as many romans as you can .
but if your tastes are marginally more highbrow , i also have tips .
forget the forum , definitely forget the coliseum , no fun now they can't slaughter christians .
forget the sistine chapel , first example of a poof interior designer gone mad ...
what is daniel oleaver doing on the television?
it's called the smooth guide .
making culture bearable " . ... equally serene and equally beautiful professore giovana dabrache .
who is about to show me her diptych .
same old creep .
oh .
shame .
he always speaks very warmly of you .
oh , yeah?
yeah .
how about we go out for a bite to eat tonight?
oh .
can t .
i have to go out with my boyfriend .
he's a human rights lawyer .
i know .
i'm meeting him for a romantic supper .
oh .
bridget jones .
bridget , it's mark .
oh .
i was just talking about you .
i'm running late .
do you want me to cancel?
oh .
no , that's fine .
are you sure?
be as late as you like .
chuck him , while you're not pregnant with his unwanted child .
i only said he was working late .
in one hour , he'll be coming in his secretary's mouth while he rings to say what he wants for starters .
friends spend years finding you a boyfriend , then instantly tell you to dump him .
even if he isn't shagging her already , he's thinking about it .
a man dating a woman with large breasts will bed one with small breasts .
rubbish .
mark's above all that nonsense .
jellyfisher alert .
jellyfisher alert .
janey osborne .
talking to her is like swimming in a sea and being stung repeatedly by an enormous jellyfish .
bridget .
how's it going with that divine man of yours?
you must be so pleased to have a boyfriend at last .
first jellyfish of the evening .
is he taking you to the law council dinner?
oh .
well , i'm sure he's just forgotten .
better start slimming into that dress .
he's given you the night off to cheer up your single friends .
sweet .
actually , he's got a big case on , trying to get everyone in mexico out of prison .
we're meeting for a very late romantic dinner .
really?
that's so odd ,
'cause i saw him an hour ago going into his house with rebecca gillies .
she's only 22 .
she's got legs up to here .
and daddy owns half of australia .
see ya , babes .
who is rebecca gillies?
what's she doing going into my boyfriend's house?
where he never asks me .
and with legs up to here?
my legs only come up to there .
you have fine legs .
climber s legs .
i say go over there and ask him , straight out , are you or are you not sleeping with rebecca gillies?
if he says ...
i won't dignify that with an answer ...
then you know he's shagging her .
# all that i have is all that you've given ...
it's all about confidence and trust .
mark would never betray me .
everything will be lovely and we'll have sex in the kitchen .
oh , god .
i'm coming .
oh , god !
what is that?
two seconds , i'll be straight down .
who is that? # ...
i find you lied
# and i can't believe it's true
# wrapped in her arms i see you across the street
# i see you across the street
# and i can't help but wonder if she knows what's going on
# you talk of love but don't know how it feels
# when you realise
# you're not the only one
let's get on with it . # ... oh , you better stop
# stop # before
# you tear me all apart
# you better stop
# stop ...
you are a very demanding man . # ... you go and break my heart ...
bridget jones .
no , i'm bridget jones .
that's what i meant .
you must be ...
rebecca gillies .
i've been so looking forward to meeting you
after everything mark's told me .
why?
what's he said?
where is mark?
actually , er ...
becky , who is it?
becky?
right .
great .
right ...
bridget .
hello , mark .
hello ...
lawyers who work with mark .
good evening .
everything under control , i see .
um ...
excellent graph .
lovely legs .
thank you .
i am so sorry .
i thought ...
oh , i don't know what i thought .
now you're really angry with me .
no , i'm not .
it's ok , you can say if you are .
it's not the end of the world .
i'll get you a glass of wine .
the thing is i ran into janey osborne , who said she'd just seen you with this girl , with really long legs , and shazzer and jude said i should get over here straightaway .
following the orders of the dating war command , you executed a raid .
you are angry .
i'm not , just disappointed .
disappointed?
oh , god , that's worse than angry .
i'm just disappointed i can't take you home this instant .
oh .
what about all those lawyers?
oh , plenty of time to butter them up at the law council dinner next friday .
don't want to go , do you?
i'd love to .
oh , stupid bridget , stupid friends .
wonderful , loyal mark darcy ... ... who loves me just the way i am .
what are you doing?
getting dressed .
why are you dancing around in that tent?
because i don't want you to see any of my wobbly bits .
that's pointless , because i have a very high regard for your wobbly bits in all circumstances .
really?
absolutely .
i think it's high time we had another look .
# yeah
# are you digging on me?
# yeah
# i'm digging on you , now , baby
# yeah
# do you want a little bit of my love?
# yeah ...
he really is very , very , very nice .
# all the time i knew
# that you loved me
# and you promised me ...
i miss you too .
# that you would be my only man
# yeah
# are you digging on me?
i've never been happier in my entire life .
however , must not obsess or fantasise .
bridget darcy .
mrs darcy .
mr and mrs darcy .
lord and lady darcy .
wonder what mark darcy would be like as a father .
to his children , i mean , not to me .
that would be a weird , oedipus like thought .
at last , life is on track .
fiance , wife ... mother .
bugger .
ever fancied doing it in the dark with a total stranger?
all right , perhaps not a total stranger .
back off , oleaver , or i'll report you to a sexual harassment tribunal .
i'm a serious journalist .
is that your most serious skirt , jones?
oh ...
do you like it?
i thought you hated television .
i hate watching television .
being on it is ...
hello there . ... entirely different .
daniel , thought the madrid piece was outstanding , really original .
cheers , jeremy .
appreciate that .
we had to work really hard on that one .
tosser .
talking of which , how is mark darcy?
you still ...?
yes , i am .
and i intend to be for a very long time .
good .
you know what a fan i am of any woman married to mark darcy .
that's not funny .
seriously , though , jones , speaking purely unselfishly , i worry about you .
you do know that it's a fact that most lawyer's wives die of boredom?
and what about you?
still shagging anything that moves?
as a matter of fact , no .
no shagging whatsoever .
i'm in shag therapy .
it turns out i have a problem .
i go to meetings , talk about my feelings .
hug people who smell .
i don't believe you .
i'm trying ... ... to be a better man , bridge , so that the next time a better woman comes along ,
i won't make a pig's ear of it .
daniel .
meeting?
yeah , yeah .
thanks .
very good hair , jones .
by the way , um , you're not free for dinner tonight , are you?
no , i'm not .
i'm going to the law council dinner .
it's a very important evening .
i can't wear that .
bridge , do you want to get married and have babies before you become barren?
trust me ...
my only grown up friend .
married to mark's partner .
she actually got engaged on the night of the law council dinner .
try it with the dress .
oh , my god !
remember , we are trying to reduce your body size by 15 per cent .
you hold the front , i'll hold the back .
one , two , three ...
what's going on in there?
not too bad , actually .
tra la !
fantastic .
right , let us begin .
i am going to make you into a princess .
goody .
nothing like being in the hands of a total genius .
wow .
whatever you do ...
bugger it . ... don't iron your hair .
it's a lot worse than i thought .
we could flatten it with brylcreem .
what about a wig?
lawyers love wigs .
i preferred you in the gold .
no , whatever you do , not the gold .
great .
i'm late with mad hair and can barely breathe in scary knickers .
# la la la la la la la la ...
oh , god .
i'm very worried .
what if someone says " bridget jones , get out of here , you are ridiculous "?
stop it .
the most important thing , of course , is to look absolutely wonderful and make a magnificent entrance .
# i just can't get you out of my head ...
hi .
sorry i'm late .
hello .
i think you should go to the ladies .
but i went before i left home .
trust me on this one .
oh .
not good .
all right , tiny make up mistake , but i always have wit and conversation to fall back on .
thank you .
bridget .
hello .
derek , horatio , camilla .
horatio?
yes , horatio .
horatio was just saying he's totally against charitable giving .
what?
well , obviously you don't mean it .
absolutely .
do you think it's helpful to give a beggar fifty pence?
maybe he's just hungry .
don't be so naive .
the people you see outside the tube every day are there by choice .
end of story .
oh , no , it's not .
some people have terrible personal problems , and other people might have lost their family in some tragic ferry disaster .
and some people are just plain hopeless .
honestly , this is the sort of rubbish you'd expect from fat , balding
tory , home counties , upper middle class twits .
yeah , very good .
tested my resolve .
how did i do?
you seem to have made quite an impression .
i've put you next to giles benwick .
oh , i'm not sitting next to you?
no .
he's terribly nice , but his wife's just run off with one of the partners .
he probably won't mention it , but you should know .
i always knew she was out of my league .
you see , there's the high fliers , like annabel and mark darcy and there's the gorgeous girls , like rebecca there and there's the rest of us .
like you and me , you mean?
absolutely .
i mean , look at the state of us .
you and me stumbled into the vlp room by mistake and it's only a matter of moments before they show us the door .
my lords , ladies and gentlemen , let the quiz begin .
oh , goody .
i love quizzes .
all those years of playing trivial pursuits are about to pay off .
now i want to see your hands poised over those bells .
ready?
here we go .
what are something called " customary freeholds "?
superior copyhold .
yes .
what is the correct grace used in the inner temple for the second mooting night of michaelmas term?
amas bibendo ... fructis .
jolly good .
what is an overreaching conveyance?
what is rack rent?
when was breach of promise abolished?
define " damnum sentit dominus " .
translate " reddendo singula singulis " into ancient greek .
i believe this is the answer .
hippodamoi credemnon louestai .
absolutely correct .
now , for our final and deciding round , the category is contemporary culture .
who did the design for princess diana's wedding dress?
the emmanuels .
correct .
excellent , bridget .
name the character in footballers 'wives who , in one memorable episode , set fire to her own breasts .
chardonnay .
correct .
at this point , there are only two tables in contention and only one question left .
what was the name of madonna's first uk single?
lucky star .
sorry , i didn't quite hear .
are you sure?
wasn't it holliday?
no , everyone thinks it is , but it's not .
my entire life has been leading up to this very moment .
take that knife , slice off my head and boil it if i'm wrong .
the correct answer is lucky star .
no .
the correct answer is ...
is it holliday?
holliday , indeed , yes .
the winners of the 42nd annual law council quiz are ... the legal eagles .
lovely to see you , bridget .
oh , thanks , rebecca .
good night .
why didn't you speak to me all night?
that's the point of those dinners .
but you talked to rebecca .
and you talked to horatio .
i'll never fit in with your friends .
not if you go on calling everyone " balding , upper middle class twits " .
well , they were balding , upper middle class twits .
except for the ones who had hair .
i suppose you agree with them that poor people deserve to be poor?
don't be ridiculous .
so now i'm ridiculous?
yes , tonight you were a little .
well , tonight you were an arrogant arse .
i think i may have made a mistake inviting you and your folding underpants into my life .
good night .
if you had asked me tonight ,
i'd have said no , anyway .
asked you what?
bridget?
asked you what?
oh , god , i've done it .
i've gone and done it .
one minute , you're closer to someone than anyone in the whole world , next minute , you're never going to see them again .
if you have a message for mark darcy , please speak after the tone .
hello , it's me .
i'm really , really sorry ...
sorry , it's the door .
don't go away , i have something really , really important to say .
yes , who is it?
it's me .
mark .
oh , right .
er , just a moment .
i'm on the phone .
you're outside .
look , er ...
i'll ring you later .
unless you've come to chuck me once and for all .
in which case , bye and thank you , and ... sorry .
oh , god , please don't chuck me .
if you have chucked me , please change your mind ,
i'll behave much better in future .
on the other hand , if you haven't , please behave better next time we go out .
stuck up snob .
what do you want?
i'd like to come up .
you are , after all , my girlfriend .
even though i shouted at you and called you an arrogant arse?
unfortunately , yes .
you see , the problematic thing is ...
i love you .
w what?
i said i love you .
i'm sorry , i missed that again .
i said i love you , for god's sake !
all right , no need to shout .
i'll come down and let you in .
you might be needing this in the future .
he said he loves me .
he said he loves you?
he said he loves me .
right , where is he now?
he's in the bedroom .
go back in there , bridge , and whatever you do , act completely nonchalant .
bridget , you're staring at me again .
sorry .
listen , i know this evening didn't go exactly as planned , but there was a very important question i wanted to ask you tonight .
oh , really?
yes .
i've actually been meaning to ask this for quite some time .
i've just never really found the right way to put it .
darling bridget ... ... would you ... ... like to go on a skiing mini break?
yes !
# what the world ...
this is not just a mini break .
this is a holiday in heaven .
told a tiny lie about being an extremely experienced skier .
but , honestly , how hard can it be?
ah .
shall we?
very romantic , very relaxing .
bar going up .
no .
what?
why?
um ...
er ...
oh .
oh , god .
oh , god .
oh .
ah .
bridget .
rebecca .
what are you doing here?
didn't mark tell you we were coming?
no , he didn't .
it was me who recommended the place .
i've been coming since i was 11 .
really?
three whole years .
come on , up you get .
come on .
there you go .
are you all right?
yes , fine , thanks .
you sure?
why is rebecca here?
oh , god .
well , i mentioned that we were coming and she said why didn't they come too , and i couldn't say no , could i?
come on , you two , let's crack on , shall we?
actually , i might just sit this one out .
you head on .
see you down there .
you sure?
absolutely .
i'll be fine in a minute .
right , i'll see you at base camp , then .
bastard .
i can't believe he's left me .
ooh .
oooh .
so , romantic getaway has turned into lawyer's reunion .
oooh .
i can't believe we're already into group holidays after only eight weeks of total , undisturbed sex .
walt a minute ...
no .
eight weeks?
it couldn't be , could it?
totally undisturbed ...
oh , god .
i'm pregnant .
and going to die !
oh , my god !
i can't see !
big bump !
get out of the way !
who's this?
an eccentric but exhilarating performance from a total unknown , who's now solidly in position for the bronze .
i would like a pregnancy test , please .
a pregnancy test .
ich bien , er , possibly ... mit baby .
er ...
kinder !
i am on back ... and he , er ... maken ze lieben .
er , with me .
she's pregnant !
oh , no !
no , no , not pregnant .
she's bloated .
condom?
nein .
nein , nein .
maybe like this , but maybe like this .
i think her problem is psychological .
there is nothing a pill can do to help her .
i'm a girl and i met a boy .
fraulein , and i met frau ... boy .
and possibly now mit baby , uh huh?
right , moment of truth awaits .
what if i am pregnant?
i must try not to get hopes up too high .
boyfriend and baby seems just too lucky .
bridget?
i have been looking everywhere for you .
i thought you'd broken a leg or something ...
oh , god .
you're not ...?
i might be .
what if i were?
well , i suppose i'd ...
to be quite frank , it'd be bloody fantastic .
i mean , if a little ahead of schedule .
are you really pregnant?
well , give it three minutes .
what do you fancy?
boy or a girl?
i dunno , it doesn't matter .
although , i suppose i've always had the fantasy of a son .
another mark darcy .
or maybe something like huck .
or river .
or some fabulous hebrew name like noah .
anyway , i could teach him to play cricket and rugby and visit him at eton on st andrew's day .
eton?
yes .
the darcy men have been going to eton for five generations .
well , my son's not going to be sent away from home .
especially to some fascist institution where they stick a poker up your arse that you're never allowed to remove again .
i see .
i didn't mean you .
no , of course not .
so what's the alternative?
sleeping in his parents 'bed , breastfeeding until he's a teenager and some progressive school , where the day is spent singing yellow submarine?
oh , you're absolutely right .
it's madness to allow a child to enjoy his education or live with his parents .
what is madness is to have a child if his parents can't have a discussion without one shouting at the other .
it's negative .
that's too bad .
yes , very sad .
perhaps we should go out for lunch tomorrow .
get out of the grump .
that's a good idea in theory , but you made a family arrangement .
oh , god .
darlings !
i've had the fabulous idea of inviting your parents .
another one of mother's culinary triumphs .
everything in miniature .
mini treacle tart , admiral darcy?
no , no , thank you .
the mini spotted dick rather finished me off .
so , mark , bridget , when are you two lovebirds going to name the day?
bridget , you must want to hear those ding dong bells .
well , we're certainly not thinking about that yet .
are we , bridget?
no .
god , no .
of course not .
good .
well , that's that sorted .
so , admiral , out on the high seas .
how was it?
did you mean that thing you said?
what thing?
you know what thing .
no , i don't know what thing .
the thing thing .
now , let's see , there are any number of things , um ... in an afternoon full of all sorts of things , so i , um ...
the thing where you said you're not , um ...
that you're not , not even thinking about , um ...
what's the matter?
let's get a drink .
i'm going to go to the loo , then i'm going to come back .
and then we're going to be civilised .
if you have a message for mark darcy , speak after the tone .
mark , it's rebecca .
are you there?
obviously not .
probably still out with bridget .
um ...
anyway , i hope lunch with the parents went well .
i'm sure you were dutiful and very polite , as usual .
er ...
whatever .
anyway , look , maybe give me a ring when you get back .
i thought i might pop round for a nightcap .
but i suppose that's a silly idea .
bridget's probably there .
sleep tight .
oh , christ , what now?
are you or are you not having an affair with rebecca gillies?
i won't dignify that question with an answer .
right .
all i did was go to the loo .
bridget !
bridget .
that's not your coat .
oh , right .
oh , bridget , what are you doing?
i read you should never date someone if you can think of three reasons not to .
can you think of three?
yes .
which are?
well , first off , i embarrass you .
i can't ski , i can't ride , i can't speak latin .
my legs only come up to here and yes , i will always be a little bit fat .
and you , you fold your underpants before you go to bed .
now , hang on , that can't be a reason .
no , it's not a reason .
but you're not perfect either .
you look down your nose at absolutely everyone , and you're incapable of doing anything spontaneous or potentially affectionate .
it feels like you're waiting to find someone in the vlp room who's , who's so fantastic ... just the way she is , that you don't need to fix her .
bridget , this is mad .
perhaps you've already found her .
do you want to marry me?
look , i ...
you see , you can never muster the strength ... to fight for me .
i can't believe i did that .
# what do i gotta do to make you love me?
# what do i gotta do to make you care?
# what do i gotta do when lightning strikes me
# hmm
# and i wake to find that you're not there?
# what do i gotta do to make you want me?
# hmm
# what do i gotta do to be heard?
# and what do i say when it's all over , babe?
# oooh ooh
# and sorry seems to be the hardest word
# it's sad so sad
# why can't we talk it over , babe?
# always seems to me
# when sorry seems to be
# the hardest word #
five weeks later .
4, 000 pounds .
am enjoying a relationship with two men simultaneously .
the first is called ben , the other , jerry .
zero .
you have absolutely no messages .
not a single one .
not even from your mother .
hello?
hello , darling .
you haven't forgotten our lunch date?
of course i have .
i'm suicidally depressed .
don't be silly , bridget .
meet me at debenhams at twelve o'clock .
mum ...
i thought we were going to have something to eat .
patience , please .
i've got a big surprise for you , darling .
what?
don't say " what " , say " pardon " .
tra la !
what do you think?
oh , my god .
daddy and i are getting married .
you're already married .
we're doing it again .
reaffirming our vows .
you are going to be a bridesmaid , and absolutely everything is going to be lavender .
and when i say everything , i mean ... ... everything .
oh , god , i'm never going to get married and my sodding mum and dad are doing it twice .
# no more candlelight no more romance
# no more small talk ...
bloody know it all .
the big , juicy apple .
the city that never sleeps with the same person two nights running .
my favorite place in america , where sex and the city isn't just a programme ,
it's a promise .
morning , rach .
sorry .
oh , cheer up , misery guts .
i have good news for you .
sure , right .
what's the angle?
i interview some rocket scientist while he looks through my skirt with x ray glasses?
no .
although that is a bloody good idea .
no .
the fact is the smooth guide is doing very well with women , but the network want us to cast a wider net and use a smooth guide ess .
me?
with daniel oleaver?
it's the next logical step .
i think thailand is first on the list .
no .
i won't do it .
not now .
not in a million years from now .
excuse me?
i am a top television journalist , not some boorish bint in a bikini .
really?
strong words from somebody who doesn't know where germany is .
who told you that?
oleaver .
he said he couldn't be expected to go out with someone who thought iran was david bowie's wife , and who didn't know where germany was .
daniel oleaver is a deceitful , sexist , disgusting specimen of humanity , that i wouldn't share a lift with , let alone a job .
come on , jones , there must have been something you liked about me .
well ... you have a nice car .
and quite nice manners .
outside the bedroom .
but that's about it .
and by the way , i know exactly where germany is .
the question is do you know the location of your arsehole?
as a matter of fact , i do know the exact location of my arsehole .
and hers .
oh , come on , jones , it was just a silly joke .
not a very funny one .
go on , then .
what?
where is it?
where is germany?
next to france .
and?
and also belgium ...
poland .
and it has a sea coast .
which sea?
oh , sod it .
now , look ,
i think we should talk about finch's suggestion .
i am going to thailand , jones .
wouldn't you like to be my little girl guide?
thailand?
you'll shag before you leave heathrow .
i'll be perfectly fine .
i'm eschewing all men .
and cigarettes .
and carbohydrates .
we can't possibly let you go .
on your own .
oh , stop it , all of you .
i am a mature , sophisticated , professional woman and i'm going to thailand entirely on my own , thank you very much .
fuck !
sorry .
fuckity fuck .
sorry .
and now our final passengers have joined us , we can get underway .
someone's gotta be last .
are we not sitting together?
oh , fuck .
i don't think we're really in a position to , um ... ... make a fuss .
sorry .
hi .
sorry .
what's our film?
what's your name?
mine's olive .
er , bridget .
good afternoon again , ladles and gentlemen .
we're about to offer a wide range of duty free items .
details can be found in your in flight magazine .
wonderful people , the thais .
particularly the young ladies .
if you know what i mean , eh?
oh , for heaven's sake .
come with me .
come with me now .
where are we going?
just through here .
thank you .
this is worse than school .
it really wasn't my fault .
it's a fizzy drink , you know , it just ...
it just sort of fizzied over .
couldn t bear to think of you back there in slum class , jones .
graham , thank you .
you are the best air steward i've ever come across .
and if i may say so , the smartest .
thank you , sir .
i thought you were there already , doing research .
fuck , no .
i make it up as i go along .
it's 13 hours for this trip .
i need some in flight entertainment .
why don't you tell me , in detail , about your school netball tour , particularly the unsavoury incident in the communal showers .
i didn't play netball .
or go to a girls 'school .
or have showers .
now that's just not true , is it?
let me start you off .
no .
if you're gonna be dull , i'm going to plunge back into mrs dalloway , and you know how she loves that .
dirty , dirty bitch .
# here's a new thing
# that's gonna please ya
# just a little town down in indonesia
# bangkok ...
arrived bangkok .
very hot .
relieved at last to throw myself into serious journalistic work .
thailand has long called travellers from around the globe to take spiritual succour and karmic rest .
for centuries , western visitors have been inevitably drawn to some of bangkok's oldest sanctuaries .
so true , bridget .
even i , fight it as i may , am no exception .
the moment i arrive here , i almost feel an irresistible pull ... ... to this .
the temple of tranquillity .
indeed , nothing symbolises thailand's extraordinary fusion of east and west , of tradition and innovation , better than this .
fully body to body massage .
sawatdee kha?
sawatdee khrab?
an incredible thing about thailand is the amazing traditional cuisine .
i'm going to taste kapaluk , the ultimate delicacy .
oh , fuck !
oh , fuck !
oh , my god .
my god .
um ...
er ...
mmm .
how about a lovely locust?
i can't .
no , no , i can't .
they're delicious .
oh !
now that is ko panyi , which is the setting for a very famous thai poem , which i think you'd like very much , jones .
it's all about a badly behaved prince who finds true love with a beautiful , and as it happens , very slightly overweight princess .
you're teasing me .
i never tease about poetry .
oh , suvarnamali why can you not see that i adore you?
why do you avoid and scorn me?
if you cast me off and leave me
how should i live another day?
and you thought all i knew of thailand was pussies and ping pong balls .
you wouldn't sleep with him?
no , of course not .
absolutely not .
but he is clever .
yes?
and handsome .
he's also a dysfunctional , fucked up , middle aged , lost boy .
well , no one's perfect .
i didn't realise you were busy .
he's young enough to be your grandson .
i know .
isn't that great?
come on , guys , i've got a very special treat lined up for lunch .
i'm getting rather fond of jed , and i must say he has a genuine interest in thai cuisine .
i wouldn't have thought omelette would be big in thailand .
or mushrooms , for that matter .
it's magic .
it is a magic mushroom omelette , isn't it?
well , that's awful .
there is nothing funny in this at all .
although , thank god , the mushrooms don't actually seem to be working .
# just what is it that you want to do?
such lovely colours !
# we wanna get loaded and we wanna have a good time ...
beautiful bridget !
beautiful bridget !
beautiful bridget !
bridget jones !
bridget jones !
but , wait ...
bridget jones?
what sound is that?
it is daniel oleaver .
how unutterably beautiful he is .
jones , what the hell are you doing?
you are lovely colours . # i don't wanna lose your love ...
here .
here i am .
i think you're completely off your face .
hey .
bloody hell .
oh ...
oh , i'm an angel .
oh .
how lovely .
glorious sand .
oh .
i want to be naked .
naked as a baby .
come on , then , angel .
up you get .
all right?
mmm .
how are you feeling?
completely embarrassed .
don't be .
you're charming on drugs .
in future , just say yes .
do you know , i never really understood why you wanted to go out with me .
it seemed so unlikely .
come on .
for god's sake .
you're sexy .
you make me laugh .
at you , of course , not with you .
and you were ... ... incidentally ... ... the best shag ... ... i ever had .
the best?
aside from simon reade in the fifth form locker room , yeah .
suppose i said you were pretty good too?
pretty good?
was i better than mark darcy?
by the way , is it true he always says " i'm sorry , i think i'm going to come "?
who told you that?
it's common knowledge , isn't it?
come on , jones .
who gave who the hoof?
and why?
let's just say that we suffered from a fatal incompatibility .
i have missed you , jones .
i don't suppose there's any circumstances in which you would ever consider thinking about trusting me again?
absolutely not .
well , i suppose i'll be getting back to my little hut now .
thank you very much , daniel .
i had a nice time .
is that the big dipper or the little one?
i can never tell them apart .
definitely the big one .
you can't see the little one this close to the equator .
oh , please .
you don't know about astronomy .
i most certainly do .
i'm passionate about it .
you know , jones , if stargazing is something that interests you , then it has to be said that the view from my balcony is quite outstanding .
perhaps you'd like to come up and have a little look?
i don't think so .
see over there?
along my arm .
that's it , over there .
that is orion's belt .
and next to that is a very sexy little constellation called ursa's maiden .
ah .
she's being very naughty and trying to undo orion's belt .
all right , what about ... that one?
yes , well that is a very , very famous star .
um , right next to , of course , um ...
i don't know , some other fucking star that's been there for years and years .
seen one star , you've seen the lot , that's what i say , jones .
different with girls , though .
some girls ... ... are special .
are they?
i think so .
what is this special power you hold over me , jones?
and what about your therapy?
i think you might be it .
# i'm not in love
# so don't forget it
# it's just a silly phase # i'm going through
# and just because
# i call you up
# don't get me wrong
# don't think you've got it made
# i'm not in love ...
god , i hope you're wearing those giant panties .
please .
please be wearing the giant panties .
please .
oh , my old friends .
oh , daddy's home .
did you miss me?
because daddy missed you .
yes , he did .
wait .
sorry .
can i just have a minute?
just a minute .
oh , god .
oh , god .
oh , god .
oh , god .
# big boys don't cry big boys don't cry
# big boys don't cry big boys don't cry ...
everything all right?
yeah , sure .
just a bit ... nervous .
i mean , you see , if i stay with you tonight , well , it's definitely the end of something ... important with someone .
um , which has probably ended already , but perhaps ...
bridge , bridge bridge , bridge .
doesn't everyone deserve a second chance?
hmm?
except hitler .
well , he was very , very , very naughty .
what?
nothing .
er , come back later , please .
thank you very much .
bridge , it's nothing .
leave it .
leave it .
you made order for 10 . 30 .
order for what?
me .
10 . 30 .
you know , i've had it up to here with this hotel .
it's been cock ups like this all week .
you mr oleaver?
yesterday , you with maria .
she say you big tipper .
i mean , i'm up for it if you are .
actually , no , that was stupid .
it's just one little slip .
don't let it ruin what was gonna be a fantastic weekend shagathon .
i don't want a shagathon .
no , nor do i. nor do i.
you're right .
you're looking for a weekend of sex ,
i'm looking ...
for more .
i feel i can change .
i absolutely can change .
i need to change .
i can't believe i fell for it again .
daniel , i really do think that you should go and fuck yourself .
or her .
but definitely not me . # think # think
# think about what you're trying to do to me
# think # think think
# let your mind go ...
i can't believe he made up the sex therapy thing .
doesn't matter .
i finally learnt my lesson , and it's an excellent lesson to have nailed .
fuck !
what?
no fucking room in the fucking suitcase .
there's room in mine .
give me something .
great .
what the hell is this?
it is a fertility snake bowl .
ooh .
jed gave it to me . # think think # let your mind go ...
how romantic .
# freedom ...
the way i look at it , in everyone's life , there's a certain amount of shit .
that's true .
in the last year , things have turned out pretty shitty .
so logically , mathematically , even , it's got to be time for something not shit .
like what?
maybe mark will have chucked rebecca .
and he'll run to my door , fall to his knees , possibly wearing a wet white shirt , and beg me to come back . # think # think
# think about what you're tryin 'to do to me ...
yes , i very confidently expect very , very good times ahead .
final call for all passengers to london ...
isn't he cute?
hello .
hello .
oh ...
seems to be getting a bit excited .
oh .
er ...
bridget !
it's just a misunderstanding .
hold the plane .
hold the plane .
excuse me !
excuse me !
all remaining passengers please report to gate 27 immediately .
it's not mine .
these yours?
yes .
i mean , they're not my favourite pair .
you can't do this .
i'm english .
and an award winning journalist .
well , maybe not award winning , but i have been to lots of award ceremonies .
hello .
bridget jones .
lovely to meet all of you .
oh , my bloody god and fuck .
i hope they've told the british ambassador .
surely shazzer would have raised the alert .
maybe they got shazzer as well .
oh , god , 28 hours .
how much longer?
jones .
bridget jones , you come now .
charlie parker knowles , assistant consul .
thank god you're here .
um , shall we ...
i really had absolutely nothing to do with it .
jed planned the whole thing .
that's why he snogged shazzer , who's much older than him and slightly past her peak .
yes , he sounds the most frightful shit .
mmm .
the bore is everyone who gets caught has exactly the same story , so unless we find this , this jed fellow and get a full confession , you're on a bit of a sticky wicket .
well , how sticky?
something like 15 to 20 years .
15 years?
or maybe ten if we're lucky .
ten years !
in here?
very black .
all my life i've had the feeling something terrible was about to happen .
now it has .
bijjit , right?
bridget , actually .
my name phrao .
you're my friend?
steady on !
superbra !
you lend me .
one day , two cigarette .
oh .
well , i'll think about it .
actually , i was thinking of giving up , but that was before i was arrested and thrown into a thai prison for ten to 15 years .
circumstances change .
no , it really , really is " touched " .
like a vir gin , touched for the very first time " .
no , you wrong .
no .
# like a wersion
vir gin . # fucked for the very first time
touched . # like a wersion
ten years of this?
i
stop !
enough .
enough .
if you're going to do it , you really ought to do it properly .
after all , madonna is nothing if not a perfectionist .
five , six , seven , eight and one ...
# like a virgin
# touched for the very first time
# like a virgin
# when your heart beats
# next to mine ...
dear mum and dad ,
i'm missing you a lot .
please write as soon as you can .
i'm feeling pretty low .
bijjit jone .
in there .
you have five minutes .
just five .
mark?
you all right?
oh ...
fine .
hmm .
and ... scared shitless .
but , you know , perky .
i can't believe you've come all this way .
i haven't .
i was out here handling a foreign office case when i heard about your situation .
i haven't done anything wrong .
i promise you , it's all a big mistake .
yes , well , i'm sure it is .
i've got all the papers here and i'm sure we can sort it out .
i think about you all the time .
and i'm so sorry ,
i really , really am , for everything that happened between us .
yes , well ...
we don't have much time and i need you to identify someone for me .
is this the man with whom you were seen taking hallucinogenic mushrooms before you spent the night with daniel oleaver?
yes , that's him , but i think you should know ...
the same man who gave you the snake containing the drugs?
yes , that's him , that's jed .
but it was shazzer's snake , not mine , and as far as daniel oleaver goes ...
your sex life doesn't concern me at all .
has there been any ill treatment here?
no , no .
well , i mean ... ... the toilet facilities are well below par , but ...
good , that makes things simpler .
listen , they're prepared to drop all charges against you which is extremely lenient , given the circumstances .
you're going to be out within a week .
and ...
goodbye .
mark?
thank you .
you're welcome .
i'm just the messenger .
the order came from above .
well , good luck .
glad i could be of help .
so , bijjit , what happen?
well , um ...
bijjit !
how this can happen?
this is terrible !
you are innocent !
they're always cheating us .
no , no , no .
that's all fine .
they've dropped the charges and they're letting me go .
but that good news .
what is wrong?
mark darcy definitely ... ... doesn't love me anymore .
ohhh .
you see the trouble is it was me who chucked him .
he treat you bad?
yeah , actually , he did .
my boyfriend treat me bad too .
me too .
mine as well .
me too .
then you know all about it .
you think you've found the right man , but then there's so much wrong with him and he finds there's so much wrong with you and it all just falls apart .
don't tell me .
my boyfriend , he seem really nice .
then he start to hit me .
make me work on street .
my boyfriend , he say he love me .
but he do no work , and make me work 24 hour a day .
then he make me take heroin drug .
what about you , bijjit?
what your bad boyfriend do?
well , er ... ... he really didn't stick up for me at this lawyers 'supper ... and , um , then he would fold his ...
oh , same sort of thing , really .
hitting me and making me take drugs .
stealing all my money and stuff .
oh , god .
i've been the world s biggest fool .
bijjit?
just a few tiny leaving presents .
no luxuries .

if you want something smooth on your wall , you could do worse than john currin .
he is about the only contemporary painter who can paint .
there's usually something interesting and allegorical , plus of course , there is a very high perv quotient .
did you see her?
out .
out it .
sorry , everyone , sorry .
it's my stalker .
fuck off , darcy , some people have jobs to do .
did you see her surrounded by police , dogs , handcuffs?
come on , she's a big girl , she can take care of herself .
i'm only going to ask you one more time .
did you see her?
you're only gonna ask me one more time?
you haven't got your wig on now , dear .
i'll take that as a yes .
yes , i did see her .
right .
right , good .
will you step outside , please?
oh , no , it's not possible .
darcy , do you have any idea what century we actually live in?
are you gonna step outside or am i gonna have to drag you?
i think you're gonna have to drag me .
you're insane !
and you're a disgrace , oleaver .
you're pulling my hair !
i'm not going in the sodding water .
# touching you 'cause you're touching me
# i believe in a thing called love
# just listen to the rhythm of my heart
# there's a chance we can make it now
# we'll be rocking 'till the sun goes down
# i believe in a thing called love
# oooh ooh ooh ...
fuck off !
no , you're going in , oleaver !
if i'm going in , you're coming with me .
you smug bastard .
oh , my god .
get up .
well , what are you gonna do now?
drown me in 16 inches of water?
yes , good idea .
fuck !
stop , stop .
listen , listen , listen ...
ok , i left her at the airport .
i shouldn't have done that .
but she bumped into jed herself and i didn't fucking well seduce her , all right?
you didn't?
there's something wrong with her .
she's gone all frigid .
i spent the night with a gorgeous thai girl .
who in fact turned out to be a gorgeous thai boy .
satisfied?
yes .
thank you .
you know what , mate?
if you're so obsessed with bridget jones , why don't you just marry her?
'cause then she'd definitely shag me .
# i believe in a thing called love
# just listen to the rhythm of my heart
# i believe in a thing called love #
bridget !
bridget !
over here !
what was it like?
how did you survive?
any girl who's been single in london knows how to handle herself .
darling !
will you be going back?
sorry i didn't write .
i've just been so busy .
hello , darling .
you look lovely .
skinny , but lovely .
oh , thank you .
oh , it's good to be home .
ciggy?
no , no , thanks .
i've given up again .
shame .
i find them very useful .
i take great comfort in the fact they might kill me before things get worse .
the darcys rang to say how pleased they were you were out .
i rather thought mark might be here to meet you .
yes , but you must remember we split up .
so no hope there?
no hope there .
believe me , next time i will not fuck it up , mum .
language , darling .
sorry .
next time , i will not fuck it up ... ... mother .

hello .
hello .
oh , darling .
hiya .
bridget ...
i'm so sorry .
it's all right .
well , thank god for mark darcy .
i mean , he might be a boring arse , but he performed a miracle .
that's a bit of an overstatement .
he actually seems to be the villain of this piece .
he's a top human rights lawyer and he left it to someone else to get me out .
he was just a messenger .
who told you that?
he did .
straight from the horse's mouth .
the horse wasn't quite telling you the truth .
i called mark the minute i landed in london .
we went to his office and within half an hour , he'd woken two cabinet ministers and half of ml5 .
but none of them could locate jed , so mark flew over to interpol .
which is in lyon .
they located jed in dubai , but they don't normally extradite people , so mark rang the home secretary who rang our ambassador ...
in riyadh .
then mark flew to dubai where he identified jed , who was impounded and pushed out into ...
saudi arabia , where mark was waiting with the police .
jed was arrested and extradited back to britain .
then mark flew to bangkok , to make damn sure they'd let you go .
oh .
he was just angry about daniel oleaver .
he must still love me .
he fucking must .
taxi?
yes , please .
get in the cab !
hurry !
oh .
i forgot about you .
er , i , i , i just wanted to , um ... say something to mark .
he's at the office .
do you want to come in?
oh , no .
no , no , i don't think i will .
i really hope that you'll be happy together .
sorry?
you and mark .
i really hope that you'll be very happy together .
no , no , no , bridget , listen ... you've got it completely wrong .
i'm not in love with him .
how could i be when i'm ... seriously heartbroken and smitten with someone else?
someone else?
you , bridget .
me?
ever since i saw you here with your hair messed that night and bits of garden stuck to you .
you must have noticed .
i try to hide it , but every time i see you , i light up .
i thought you were just , you know ... ... lying .
was every look i ever gave you a lie?
i've been looking forward to this .
lovely to see you , bridget .
thank you very much .
that was lovely .
really lovely .
but i'm afraid it's still men in general , and mark darcy in particular , that i love .
right .
lf , er , if i ever do decide to , um ... you know , bat for the other side ... ... well , there's no one else .
only you .
hello , giles .
hello , bridget .
# open up your eyes
# then you'll realise
# here i stand with my
# everlasting love
# need you by my side
# girl , to be my bride
# you'll never be denied ...
inns of court , please .
fast as you can .
what do you think of this jacket?
yeah , very nice indeed .
no , be honest .
what do you think of the whole jacket/ trouser combination?
disaster .
actually , can we take a tiny detour?
i'll be back in literally two seconds .
# where life really flows
# no one really knows
# till someone's there to show

it's not about looks .
# your love i'll keep for evermore as i was saying .
# you're the first ...
excuse me , i'm looking for mr darcy .
down there , right along the corridor , and just to the left .
thank you very much .
# oh oh , oh oh , oh oh , oh no no
# oh oh , oh oh , oh oh , oh no no
# oh oh , oh oh , oh oh , oh no no
# oh oh , oh oh , oh oh , oh no no ...
i love you .
i always have and i always will .
oh , um ...
i don't love you , and i never have , and ... ... i never will .
sorry .
come in .
hello , bridget .
hello , mark .
er ...
i'm sorry , i'm disturbing you .
well , yes , a bit .
i'll just ... sit outside while you finish .
no , no , no , please , say what you have to say , young lady .
mr santiago is the peruvian secretary for trade .
and mr hernndez is his number two .
hello .
hello .
hello , hello , hello .
how can we help you , young lady?
well , er ...
er ...
i just wanted to tell mr darcy here that i heard what magnificent work he actually did releasing me from prison .
tiny , tiny misunderstanding to do with an enormous stash of cocaine .
and i also wanted to say , since having found out that his girlfriend is actually a lesbian ...
... that i love him .
always have .
always will .
and that i'm ... ... you know ... ... available for dates ... ... if he should feel so inclined .
so , er , your girlfriend is a lesbian .
look , if you'll all just excuse us for a second ...
i think we should ...
bridget , that was not the most romantic proposition i've ever heard .
well , maybe it is romantic because it's not .
i mean ...
i know there's no music playing , and it's not snowing , but that doesn't mean that it , that it can't really be something .
you're right .
in fact , there's a question i've been meaning to ask you .
all right .
as long as it's not " will you marry me?
