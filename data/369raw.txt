now you got me .
saru .
i have a job for you .
if you accept my offer , then al of your past crimes will be for gotten .
if you get me out of here , that means many more people will die .
what have you been doing at a time like this?
you killed someone?
our swords are only for the mission !
you don't understand !
the performers were attacked instead of us .
they had our drawing .
so yae and ...
we must leave here immediately .
kiyomasa is still alive .
we killed his double .
what did you say?
amagi , what's wrong?
ninja's poison got him .
say it isn't so .
let's go .
quick !
let's go?
master , what about amagi?
amagi won't last .
master , what are you talking about?
you are going to leave him behind?
we can't do that !
why do you think we have worked so hard until now?
damn it , i am totally confused !
have you for gotten that we live only to carry out our mission?
we killed our dear friends , and stood by when villagers were murdered .
killing an enemy we don't hate is one thing , but not saving innocent people from dying ...
what is our mission , then?
after everything we've been through , how can we leave amagi here?
master !!
who are you aiming your sword at?
withdraw your sword , ukiha !
your sword can't even kill an insect at this moment .
it's like swinging a mer e stick .
you are no longer an assassin .
amagi .
sorry .
go ... ... please go .
don't be silly , amagi .
amagi !
amagi !
why did you do that?
i'll walk you ... to the main road .
good bye .
good bye .
listen hyuga .
why don't you come to tangou?
what?
it's my hometown .
we'll have azumi come , too .
tangou?
sorry , yae .
i may not be able to come to tangou .
i thought this smell was familiar .
i guess my sense of smell is as sharp as a dog's .
who ar e you?
me?
i'm bijomaru mogami .
we just finished off three guys , now a newcomer .
i hate to break up such a nice romantic scene , but i want you to die .
she has nothing to do with us .
let her go .
sorry , no .
being slashed before the girl you like and exposing your misery will increase your pain and suffering al the more .
what did you say?
have you ever thought of yourself being slashed?
b ood comes gushing out .
no matter how much you endure , it's useless , you know you are going to die .
you want to die quickly , but you can't .
what will you think then?
one sword is broken .
that's no good .
saru , loan your sword to him .
it's no fun slaying an enemy who is not properly armed .
don't worry .
we have no business with the girl .
i would be offended if you blame your defeat on fighting with only one sword .
do you know why this sword does not have a hand guard?
i never defend .
i will immobilize you with one blow .
i was also taught to do as much .
i am totally thrilled !
you are quite quick .
but you failed to notice that you are cut?
don't come !
run !
don't move !
stay and watch !
if you run , i will kil you .
it hurts , right?
do you want to die quickly?
i won't let you die so easily .
enough of that .
the fight is over .
monkey face !
if you spoil my fun , you will die , too .
go ahead !
your bad taste creeps me out .
hyuga !
pity to leave her on her own .
bijomaru !
what significance is there to kill a girl who has nothing to do with this?
what significance is there to live , anyway?
shall we go?
the next one better be stronger !
if not , then i will fight against you !
you got that , monkey face?
he fought master fully .
we'll wait for nagato here .
yes .
he said you were sweet .
he wanted to stay with you a bit longer .
hyuga truly liked you .
what will you do now?
will you seek revenge?
the friend of your enemy will come to kill you .
a never ending story .
will you continue to kill each other forever?
there are many evil people in the world .
someone has to kill them .
it doesn't have to be you .
someone else can take care of it .
frightneningly good swordsman ... he's already killed one assassin .
but can hardly like him .
in fact , i hate him .
don't be so harsh .
saru , i want you to do something .
the final showdown will be in gamo .
i wonder how they ar e doing .
they are dead .
that's not true .
they will definitely come .
master gessai ,
kiyomasa is heading for gamo .
gamo?
it's a ship !
he plans to leave gamo by ship .
we must get him in gamo , on land .
but the enemy is aware of our moves .
they won't sit still .
i know .
we have no choice but to start the attack .
take these .
they might be of use at some point .
gr eat !
be careful .
if they explode too close to you , you'll be blown to bits .
don't touch me !
farewell .
i am counting on you .
you have a beautiful face .
how much is your ass?
you want to die that much?
don't kill our allies r ecklessly .
money !
do you want mor e money?
we need your help .
you guys help us a little , and more money and rewards will be yours .
look , when we cross those mountains , it'll only take 5 days to reach tangou .
i see .
you will get to see your mother soon , yae .
mother ...
you don't know your mother?
ever since i was little , i've been with master and everyone .
put this on .
girl's clothing .
i prefer this .
this is more convenient for hiding my swords .
you are a girl .
i'm ...
girls don't talk like that !
stay still !
there we go .
you look beautiful .
don't say that !
azumi .
the swords don't suit you .
i don't want to see another person die .
kiyomasa is in that mansion .
let's go .
master !
okay , spread out !
i won't let you get away !
my nose is that of a dog's .
it's me , assho es !
that bastard .
i'll get him .
it's incredible you made it this far .
why won't you finish him off?
if i kill him , he won't be of any use to us as bait .
did you say bait?
a few more assassins need to be killed .
master !
ukiha !
run , run away .
wait for the next opportunity !
run away , i want you to complete your mission .
what ar e you doing?
run away quickly .
don't worry about me .
go , go !
run !
sme is nice .
be quiet .
how fortunate we ar e on a mountain like this .
which one should i pick?
stop it .
stop it?
okay , i'll stop it .
i pick you .
taro , i'll give you this one .
no matter how much i try to escape ... ... i can't avoid it .
even if i don't want to kil ... ... i am forced to kill .
you bitch !
i'm sorry , yae ...
i have no ...
... choice but this .
if it weren't for master , i would never have lived .
he will protect you .
he always will .
i am going to wait for you .
i'll be waiting for you in tangou .
if you hadn't been in jured , our fight would have been mor e fun .
it's a pity i can't stay and fight your assassins .
saru , i'll leave the rest to you .
assassins ar e not going to show up no matter how long we wait .
such heavy security for a few assassins .
general kanbei is too cautious .
i'll be back .
hey wait a minute .
you just took a break a while ago .
it's my turn now .
let's decide with this .
i'll bet on tails .
then i'll bet on heads .
i hear the strongest one is still alive .
i can't wait .
hey old man , are you still alive?
stop it .
you annoy me constantly .
are you ready to die now?
do you really think someone will come and rescue a dying old man like you?
huh , old man?
she's already here .
azumi .
don't come !
don't !
no , you must come .
otherwise , he will die .
damn you !
wow !
incredible , she is just incredible !
hey !
samurai bastards !
who ar e you aiming at?
damn it , who do you think we ar e?
just because you're a samurai , don't act so damn important .
this is bullshit !
this is our town !
never mind about her , let's get them !
this is getting to be fun !
what the hell is your problem?
this fire ball will blow everyone up into pieces .
let's ignite this !
oh , no ...
i am delighted .
no one is left to disturb us .
how splendid !
i didn't even scratch you .
this is the first time i've had to defend .
you are wonderful .
why not die?
master .
it's over .
everything is over .
ukiha and nagara are both dead .
but i'm still here .
there is no further mission that you need to pursue .
from now on , live as you wish .
survive and keep on living .
master , i don't know what to do without you .
you never used to cry .
it's so quiet .
master .
master .
no , don't .
master !
where do the stars go during the day?
time to eat !
let's go !
the stars are always there .
you can't see them during the day , but the stars are always watching over us from up above the sky .
even if we get separated one day , we will always be together .
i'll be watching over you at all times .
kanbei .
it's been a stimulating journey .
saru is not back yet .
we can't let our guard down .
i can't be scared of assassins !
when it's time to die , you die .
don't worry .
lord , you won't die so easily .
your luck is too strong .
kanbei , the time has come for war .
that stupid old leyasu ... we will blow him up into pieces .
you have done well in protecting me .
once we get home ,
i'll take you to a hot spring for some r est .
masterful !
lord !
nagara .
what are you doing?
we are the only two left .
what shall we do now?
nagamasa asano , kiyomasa kato ... the next tar get is masayuki sanada .
this time , we'll probably be killed .
we are not going to die .
we will survive .
everyone is with us .
let's go .
