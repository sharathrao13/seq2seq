your t shirts were in my closet .
these are yours .
he should let us sort our own clothes .
he seems preoccupied lately .
exactly .
would i wear old fashioned underwear like these?
did my underwear offend you?
you know what i mean .
i'm afraid i don't .
dad , are you all right?
i'm fine .
why did you ask?
no , it's just that ....
do i look bad?
no ....
i'm fine !
grandpa chu !
shan shan , jin rong , come in !
i should have come sooner to visit and thank you in person .
jin rong is too busy to bring me over .
i almost had to force her to take me .
she said that you and your whole family really took care of them .
it's only my duty .
jia jen and jin feng were good classmates .
you took care of my daughter when she was in tainan .
now that jin rong is alone in taipei ....
shan shan !
little aunt , can we draw?
for uncle chu .
thanks , but
jia jen , it's been so long .
mrs. liang !
still teaching at the same school?
yes .
still not married?
yes .
frankly , marriage is quite meaningless .
a bad marriage is such a burden .
you might as well get a divorce .
you have to be insane to marry such a loser , like jin rong's husband .
it's like a tired dog dragging some broken cart .
and in the end , you're left all alone .
lsn't that so , mr. chu?
yes .
ma , why do you have to say that?
but it's true !
prepare some fruit , jia jen .
okay .
your second daughter?
the youngest .
hello , mrs. liang .
how old are you?
twenty .
it's time to have a boyfriend .
don't wait too long like your older sister .
let's sit down .
let me make some tea .
can we draw now?
all right .
mrs. liang .
you are?
jia chien .
that's right .
you're no .
2 .
aren't you pretty?
thank you .
are you used to taipei yet?
it's okay .
good to be home .
do you have a boyfriend?
i'm sure you have several .
keep your options open .
don't listen to what men say , but watch their actions .
understood?
lsn't that right , mr. chu?
your daughters aren't bad .
your daughters are fine , too .
mine are no good .
my oldest is in the middle of this nasty divorce .
her husband was so sordid .
he fools around with several other women .
i can't even mention the details .
and there's my youngest with her white husband ... ... who plays electric guitar in the garage all weekend .
he eats hamburgers with onions every day .
and when i fry rice , the smoke alarm goes off !
i tell you , it was like a living hell there for me .
mr. chu , i'm sure you don't mind , do you?
of course not .
please .
old witch .
a breeze blows in ... ... fluttering through your clothes , across your smile .
in a dreamy garret , i am keeping my late autumn love for you .
late autumn love ....
so many times , i want to say 'i love you '
so often , i want to say 'i'm sorry '
you cried , 'this is fate .
it's over '
it's over
how are you , teacher?
but give me just one moment
one more look
don't take everything away
another chance
a little tenderness
don't let me hurt so bad
you can make me happy
make me sad
make me willing to give you ... " ... everything
thank you .
thank you .
i'm new here , so i'm not familiar with everyone .
so i nominate teacher chu for a song .
be careful .
teacher , what do you want to sing?
that won't be necessary .
i'll sing love's commandments .
love is forever , patient , and kind
love isn'tjealous
love isn't boastful or crazy
love doesn't do shameful things
a soprano !
you have a great voice .
you , too .
i wanted to ask you a question .
are you free this sunday?
i'm taking the volleyball team on an outing .
do you want to come?
an outing?
you should get some sun .
join us if you've got nothing else to do .
think about it , and let me know .
bye !
don't crowd me !
be quiet !
what do you want?
curried beef and rice .
and you?
fried rice with eggs .
it's too easy for grandpa chu .
he won't do it .
something more difficult .
here is mom's lunch box and tomorrow's menu .
bye .
you're right .
the sydney route is worth half as much as they're asking .
to think that the chief was going to offer $30 million .
great .
this is why you get paid the big bucks .
no wonder you're so tired all the time .
you should try it .
in one morning , i've already killed 2, 000 aliens and saved the world .
what did you accomplish this morning?
a small headache .
how could you kill those cute aliens?
i remember now .
forget it .
you have time to give me a hand?
sure .
i always wanted to find something chinese for him .
he has plenty of these already .
he's interested in chinese culture?
i wish .
i can't believe that in a few years , my son is growing up to be an american .
sometimes i look at him and wonder if he's actually my son .
he was raised in america , and his mother doesn't mind .
his mother?
how does she feel about you being away all the time?
she's glad i'm not around .
i think the only reason we're not divorced ... ... is that we're both too busy .
that sounds so cynical , doesn't it?
i'm just as cynical when it comes to my personal life .
sometimes i wish i could just ....
pick up and fly away .
seems like that's what you'll be doing pretty soon .
i thought that was the answer , too .
as a result , i really messed things up after i graduated from chen kong .
chen kong university?
yeah .
after graduation , my old man had a post for me in his chemical business .
chemical?
that's right .
remember the whiskey lab?
i actually enjoyed it as a subject .
it's the chaos in my life .
there was a lot of pressure from my parents , my girlfriend .
i guess i didn't have the courage .
so i left .
then you went to the u. s.?
it wasn't great , but it was better for everyone in the long run .
you okay?
this looks chinese .
that's harvey .
you have no idea how much i suffered from those kids 'shows .
wanna hear the theme?
" i love " please don't .
what the hell , i'll just buy this one .
he'll like it .
uncle chu !
jin rong , what's wrong?
is it the detective?
no .
shan shan is not feeling well .
she won't be going to school .
so you ...?
i was wondering why her lunch box was always so clean .
no one could ever finish all my short ribs before !
hope you don't mind .
of course not .
but what about the lunches i'd prepared for her?
i ate them myself , down to the last bite .
how embarrassing .
a master chef like you , eating my lunches .
i was more than happy to .
besides , i lost my sense of taste , so it's the feeling that counts .
all right .
i should go now .
don't tell shan shan that i know about this .
she'd like a little secret between you two .
yes , i understand .
bye .
i loved him so much .
how could he do this to me?
you hardly cared for him .
i was only pretending ... ... because my love for him was so strong !
i was scared of its intensity .
i feel humiliated !
i went to see him , and he ....
i don't want to live anymore .
if i only knew , then i wouldn't have ....
i thought you two ....
chu jia ning .
you ....
you two ....
dad , do you need any help?
call your sisters to dinner .
dad ....
go .
can't they stop for once?
it's so annoying .
we communicate by eating .
so what's wrong with singing karaoke?
i have an announcement to make .
i know it sounds incredible ... ... but a lot of times things happen this way .
which class did you fail?
i met a boy .
a man .
we're in love .
we plan to live together .
his family has a huge apartment , and his parents will like me .
so i plan on moving in with them .
but the main reason is ... ... i'm having his baby .
bye , dad .
that jia ning .
i'm still in a state of shock .
do you think dad's okay?
where'd he go?
he's probably chatting with mrs. liang .
don't worry about him .
take off to amsterdam .
just do what you have to do .
go ahead .
i really meant it .
sis , do you ever think about what might have been if you had stayed with ... ... what's his name again?
li kai .
had you left to the us with li kai after graduation ... ... what things might have been like?
why are you asking?
your life could've been different .
what's wrong with my life now?
do you want to be stuck here forever?
what if i told you i saw  that's enough .
this is my home , and it's fine .
this is my home , and it's fine , " but it isn't everything !
but it's dad's everything !
i know him far better than you do !
why is it that you feel that you have to meddle in my life?
what gives you the right to tell me what to feel?
that's right ... ... my heart was broken by li kai .
and you probably think that i'm pathetic for never getting over it .
but at least i had a heart to break .
i don't need your pity .
and what do you know of my heart?
nothing whatsoever ... ... because you never felt that i was worth sharing your feelings with .
you're wrong .
ever since mom died , you acted more like a parent than a sister .
you shut me out .
i thought you hated me .
never .
i broke the plate .
it's okay .
hi , if it's bo kang , stop calling me .
if it's mom , get dad to drink the healthy tea .
everyone else , please leave a message .
okay , leave a message .
hi , grace .
please call me when you hear this message .
nothing really urgent , but ... ... we haven't spoken
congratulations , vice president !
congratulations !
your promotion is official !
my family's from the hunan province .
after the war , my husband and i moved to shanghai .
there was a tong de girls 'school in shanghai .
we lived behind that alley .
my husband also loved to cook .
he was just very unlucky .
after we came to taiwan , he got stomach cancer and passed away .
i also had to fight tooth and nail to bring up my children alone .
it's not easy , mr. chu .
and look at them now .
their wings grow stronger and stronger .
they do as they please .
they could care less about you .
it's so not worth it .
that's it .
i'll translate it first thing tomorrow .
and then you're off to negotiate?
probably in a couple of weeks .
i'll be in the states for a few days , then here , and finally to sydney .
i requested that you take a few days off to come with me .
i'll need you .
you'll do fine by yourself .
frankly , with your promotion now ... ... it's really your decision .
you're my boss , technically speaking .
wrong .
i am your boss , period .
yes , " boss .
what is it?
don't you know who i am?
no .
call me chu jia chien .
okay , whatever you like .
call me chu jia chien !
have you completely erased my older sister from your memory?
your older sister?
that's right .
my older sister .
chu jia jen is my older sister .
it's only been nine years since your romance with her in college .
she's still living in the past and refusing to marry another !
you've completely forgotten her !
chu jia jen?
now you remember?
i don't remember this person , but i've heard that name before .
heard "?
but i really can't remember .
are you just pretending?
if you feel embarrassed , then forget it .
there must be some sort of misunderstanding .
i wouldn't deny it if i really knew her , whether she was your sister or not .
i need more information .
the chemistry department at chen kong .
what else do you need?
that's impossible .
there weren't many female students in the chemistry department .
what's she like?
she was your girlfriend !
she gave you her first kiss !
i don't know what else to tell you !
no , she wasn't my girlfriend .
she wasn't even in my class .
now i recall .
we were in the same department , but not the same class .
i think she hung out with jin feng .
you know jin feng?
she was my girlfriend !
we broke up after graduation .
she married an american guy before i left for the states .
i saw her once in chicago last year .
now i know .
she often spoke of her best friend .
that must have been chu jia jen .
are you all right?
you mean , she made it all up !
you're lying .
why would i lie to you?
how did this happen?
she made the whole story up .
please be home .
raymond , so glad you're home .
i just heard an absurd story .
raymond , who is it?
no one !
i'm in a little ....
oh , i understand .
i'll call you tomorrow .
welcome back , chef wen !
stop kissing up .
back to work , you fools !
chef wen  just a second !
chef wen?
where have you been?
uncle wen passed away .
b , south , 7204 .
should be around here .
i don't want tea .
i want water .
drink it , dad .
it's your favorite mountain tea .
you'll feel better .
my taste buds are gone .
i prefer water .
why is she dressed like that?
i love you , teacher chu !
can a single hand clap?
even a ballplayer needs an opponent !
why do i only get to talk to thin air about love?
who's been writing these letters to me?
if you have guts , step up !
who's been putting disgusting letters on my desk every day?
who?
why hide if you had the guts to write them?
i'm not gonna let this go !
i'll post the letters to check the handwriting !
i'll see where you can hide !
go ahead and hide !
what happened?
teacher said she'd forgive us for writing the letters .
you guys really went too far .
the outing has been changed to next week .
will you be coming?
here's what i'll do , i'll sign you up for now .
if you're busy , then let me know later .
i'm sorry those jerks hurt your feelings this way .
i'm sorry about the other night .
it was just a really confusing experience .
my mind was blank .
besides you , i didn't know where else to go .
it's all right .
i should be the one apologizing .
why should you be sorry?
it's your life .
in any case , i've made some decisions about my future .
i want to go someplace where no one knows me to get a fresh start .
i knew you could take care of yourself .
i also have a decision to announce about my future .
what decision?
you know i'm not the type to settle down .
i'm still not sure about this .
nevertheless , it's been ....
remember sophia?
no?
i'm sure i've mentioned her name to you a few times .
nothing serious in the beginning , until ....
you're getting married?
i would have told you about it sooner , but it was all so sudden .
she's really changed my life .
maybe she'll also change my future .
it sounds more absurd than your story .
i didn't know how you'd take it .
congratulations !
i knew you'd understand .
and i know you'll really like and admire sophia .
she's quite a painter , a teacher ... ... and she's also managing my gallery .
and she's a great cook .
but you know , this marriage is not going to change my current lifestyle .
she's moving into my apartment this weekend .
pretty much the same place , same job and the same life .
of course .
it's 2 : 00 already .
i'd better be going .
to where?
i'll take you .
i'm fine .
actually , i've got two hours to spare .
will we be continuing with our " friendship " status like before?
i mean , you do know about the office in the back .
sorry .
i should go now .
let's keep in touch .
please think about it some more , master chu .
the restaurant really needs your presence .
with so many good young chefs , you can easily find someone .
but none with the expertise in the art of chinese cuisine like you .
just your presence there would be a living , treasured cookbook .
do i just stand in the kitchen until i rest in peace , like old wen?
it's been said , " people die for money .
birds die for food .
to die for money is a man's business ... ... but to die for food?
that's for the birds .
is it worth it?
there's truth to the saying .
but your life has been devoted to the art of cooking .
what a pity to just let it go .
people today are so insensitive .
they can't appreciate the art of exquisite dining .
chinese cuisine has traveled to taiwan for 40 years .
and just like the rivers that eventually flow into the sea ... ... it's all the same in the end .
even a mess of slop can pass for " joy luck dragon phoenix .
what more can i say?
what is " pity "?
only when a heart feels dissatisfied can it feel pity .
fortunately , i don't plan on wasting my whole life on this stuff .
miss chu .
please help me to convince your father not to retire .
dad , you plan on retiring?
it's his own business .
he can make his own decision .
master chu , are you thinking of opening your own restaurant?
be sure to let me know .
i'll follow you .
i see that mr. chu worries a lot about his daughters .
lsn't that parenting?
it's harder for a single man .
it's been so many years .
when did mrs. chu die?
when jia ning was 4 years old , about 16 years ago .
a widower usually has a short life .
why didn't he remarry?
maybe because of the children .
he needs to wise up .
he's raising his daughters for others .
only the ones nobody wants end up with you .
if you were so wise , you wouldn't be haranguing over my divorce .
and you shouldn't blame jin feng either .
what do you think of mr. chu?
what about him?
he seems like a nice person and a great cook .
he doesn't talk much ... ... but we really connect .
i have a little announcement to make .
you know , just like jia ning , i ....
you're pregnant?
nonsense !
of course not !
but ....
it's just that ....
we just couldn't wait ....
he wants to ....
but i'm a christian ....
we asked the priest to marry us this morning .
hold on !
he's waiting outside right now .
one second !
come in !
come in .
dad , jia chien , this is my husband , chou ming dao .
hi .
jia chien !
you scared me .
you're gonna be late .
what are you doing?
packing jia jen's things .
let me help you .
i'm okay .
i loved this room when i was a child .
when your mom wanted some peace and quiet ... ... she also liked being in this room .
mrs. liang says this room is airy and has plenty of light ... ... and it would be the perfect place for an exercise bike .
mrs. liang?
i went to jin rong's place last night and told them jia jen's news .
i'm running late .
i'll be back early from work .
don't move any more stuff until i get back .
let me tell you ... ... kids are creditors collecting for the sins of our past lives .
they know no compassion .
it's better off not having any .
life is a boundless sea .
only returning to shore is happiness .
marriage is a source of sin .
a series of worries , disappointments , misery , conflict and ingratitude .
i tell you , every family has a book of unspeakable problems .
i have a cause for celebration !
jin rong's divorce decree came through .
i should have it framed .
i want her to remember her mother's words forever .
i warned her not to marry that bastard !
i'll have this divorce decree framed and hung on the bathroom wall .
you shouldn't worry so much .
whatever will be , will be .
lnstead of thinking about those creditors , why not think more about yourself?
be careful .
watch your step .
dad's really willing to give the vase to me?
not really .
but if you don't take it , mrs. liang will .
what do you mean?
she's been here almost every night .
you're kidding .
i decided not to go to amsterdam .
are you okay?
be careful .
no problem .
he's not christian .
why did you agree to marry him?
he will be .
welcome .
table for one?
i'm meeting someone .
sure , help yourself .
thanks for coming .
i thought you might not show up .
why not?
the other night ....
what kind of tea would you like?
what are you having?
mountain tea .
same for me .
thank you .
you know , i understand what you're going through ...
... although i can't really explain it .
neither can l .
it's complicated , but i can understand that .
thanks .
i heard that you turned down your promotion .
everyone's shocked .
i hope i wasn't a factor .
not at all .
well , maybe only a tiny bit .
i don't know .
it's a whole series of things .
a family wedding ... ... actually , two marriages , and someone passed away .
and a really bad investment .
all of a sudden , everything's gone .
plus my father's health .
so i've decided to stay with him for a while .
i think he needs me .
the chief asked me to try to change your mind .
but what the hell?
it's just a job .
i'm glad , you know?
glad?
that we didn't make love .
not that i still wouldn't want to .
but seeing you like this makes me happy .
i'm happy , too .
i think that we can be really good friends .
sure .
then , good friends?
good friends .
when you were a baby , i'd spin this for hours .
you wouldn't let me stop .
well , please stop now .
i'm getting nauseous again .
and i should go .
i told dad i'd help shop for sunday's dinner .
why did dad send formal invitations?
is it for guo lun and ming dao?
he said he has his own " little announcement " to make .
mrs. liang?
probably .
i think , unlike you and guo lun , they won't rush their engagement .
so hopefully , he'll have enough time to think it over ... ... and realize what a nightmare she is .
but i don't think he will fully recover from the shock of recent events .
had i known he'd go crazy , i wouldn't have ....
don't blame yourself .
he's not going crazy .
he's an old horse .
horses don't get married .
what do you think?
don't just run around !
one of you chase it , and the other grab it !
over here , ming dao !
got it !
jin rong , mrs. liang .
grandpa chu !
a tie for your father and a bottle of good wine .
also for your father .
you shouldn't have .
i should've been here earlier to help .
fine .
i hope we're not intruding .
no , not at all .
in the name of jesus christ , amen .
come , a toast .
cheers .
please help yourselves .
everyone , please help yourself .
are you moving abroad?
not anymore .
mom , what's this?
do you want some shrimp?
it's a simple meal .
please help yourselves .
mr. chu , you've prepared too much .
help yourselves .
winter melon soup .
today's red seven star fish was too big .
they're best at 2 pounds .
listen to yourself .
so picky already .
you'll never find a husband when you grow up .
you girls are lucky .
your father's a great cook .
look at this wonderful cuisine .
looks , smells and tastes good .
it's all here .
jia jen ... ... you two , bottoms up .
jia ning , you two , bottoms up .
don't drink too much .
i'm fine .
jia chien ... ... bottoms up !
fate has brought us to this table tonight .
that's right .
although we're not actually related ... ... we're still considered family .
and since we're one big family ... ... there's really nothing we can't say to each other .
i've kept this inside me for a long time .
it wasn't as if i was trying to hide any secrets from you .
i just feel that i shouldn't allow my personal affairs ... ... to be the family's worry and , thus , become a burden .
as a family , living under the same roof ... ... we can still live separate lives .
this worry that we have for each other is what makes us a family .
i've done nothing wrong by not telling .
by telling , i can end this lingering .
i cannot live my life like my methods of cooking .
i can't wait until all the ingredients are prepared and then cook .
of course , after the first bite , whether it's sour , sweet or spicy ... ... it's totally up to the individual .
that's it for now .
i'll continue after dinner .
dad , what are you trying to say?
we already knew .
you do?
let dad tell us .
go ahead and say it .
the dishes are getting cold .
so be it !
since the situation has come this far , i'll say it .
to me , this house contains several old memories .
but now , it's so empty , and almost everyone has left .
i've decided to sell it .
i found a really nice place on kum dao .
it's a bit old and may require some remodeling .
but it's a great place .
it should be ready in a few months .
great .
it's always nice to move to a new place .
new people , new house , new life .
great .
i'll make a toast to you ... ... auntie liang .
i haven't taken care of jin rong ... ... but i can swear to heaven ... ... as long as i , old chu , have one last breath ... ... i'll see that they both shall never go cold or hungry ... ... and that you're always welcome in our new home .
take a look .
this is a medical report i had done at the veteran's hospital last month .
please , auntie , we ask for your approval .
i'll first drink a toast .
cheers !
dad , you should stop drinking .
you're getting drunk .
i'm not drunk .
jin rong .
uncle chu and i have been planning for a long time .
but because of this terrible divorce , our love was a secret until now .
although love should be between two people ... ... uncle chu loves all of you .
and he loves shan shan also .
so he really wishes for your approval and understanding .
as for me ... ... l only hope to be with him at his side .
i'm willing to be with him .
that's enough !
don't say anymore .
ls there a mistake?
dad , are you crazy?
i'm not crazy .
i know exactly what i'm doing .
mom?
loosen her collar !
don't touch me !
keep your dirty hands off of me !
damn you , old chu !
help carry her to the sofa !
be careful !
be careful !
damn you !
don't touch me !
take me home , jin rong !
let me tell you , don't even think about it for as long as i still have my last breath .
let's go , shan shan .
mom , calm down .
let's take her home .
okay , okay .
what kind of world is this?
i want to die !
what kind of family is this?
be careful !
i'll take shan shan .
god won't let you get away with this !
i want to go back to america !
hello?
guo lun , how are you?
fine .
but we've been up all night .
i don't have the heart to wake them .
don't wake them .
get some sleep .
i'll be back again in a few months .
i'll come visit then .
bye , then .
tell us all about amsterdam when you come back .
and thanks for your help these past months .
take care of your wife and kid .
of course .
say hello to jia jen and ming dao for us .
they can't make it either .
they've got a big day today themselves .
bye .
do you believe that jesus christ has forgiven your sins ...
... and made you a new person?
yes .
do you believe in following jesus christ unto eternity and never regret?
yes .
believe in your heart .
in the name of the father , son and holy spirit ... ... l baptize you .
amen .
how are you feeling?
fine .
just a small headache .
you should get going .
all right .
i'll pick up shan shan on my return .
get some rest at home .
sure .
i love you .
sold
hi .
hi .
please come in .
you'll be the only one here tonight .
everyone else called to apologize , because they had plans .
where's shan shan and jin rong?
jin rong's not feeling well today .
shan shan is with her grandma .
no need to take off your shoes .
just come in .
did they tell you the ultrasound results?
