they're trying to be us .
no , they used to be us .
learning how to be us again .
no way .
some germ or some devil got those things up and walking ... but there's a big difference between us and them .
they're dead .
it's like they're pretending to be alive .
isn't that what we're doing , pretending to be alive?
he knows we're here .
christ .
it's like he's talking to them .
let's go .
a whole lot of trash this week .
that's life , bro .
whole lot of trash , trick is not to get in with it .

because i'm real good with mine .
put it away , charlie .
don't be so jumpy , kid .
what are you doing?
watching your back .
i don't like it when you go off without me .
i told you to get things ready .
i got things ready ... then i come to watch your back .

<i>we're ready to go in . </ i>

why?
the town's full of walkers .
yeah , but every town is full of walkers .

but they're dumb , riley .

let's pack it up .
we're going to call it a night .
shit happens , right?
only if you let it , charlie .
<i> life goes on</ i> <i>at fiddler's green ... </ i> <i>in the heart of one of america's</ i> <i>oldest and greatest cities . </ i>
<i>bordered on three sides</ i> <i>by mighty rivers ... </ i>
<i>fiddler's green offers luxury living</ i> <i>in the grand old style . </ i>
<i>dine at one of</ i> <i>six fine restaurants . </ i>
<i>look for that perfect gift in our fully stocked</ i> <i>shopping mall . </ i>
man , they sure did used to make it sound nice .
still sounds nice to me .
<i> there is a difference between</ i> <i>our place and other places . </ i>
<i>if you can appreciate</ i> <i>that difference ... </ i>
you're not going to be around no more?
you little bitch , you can come up and party with me any time you want .
i hate going under the river .
cholo .
shit .
let's get out of here , foxy .
yeah , man .
back off , riley .
just back the fuck off 'cause i am not in the mood .
you think that kid was in the mood?
look , he knew the risk , man .
he took the job like we all took the job knowing the risk .
exactly , the job .
you know what the job is , cholo?
it's to bring things in that people need .
not to make a few extra bucks selling liquor on the street .
what , you're talking about this?
this is for me and my new friends , to celebrate .
that's what that's for .
a kid died out there on the street tonight ... so that you can fucking celebrate .
riley , you know what you remind me of?
you remind me of my old man .
a nice guy .
i loved him and all that but he was a dumbass .
never went for anything , so he never had anything .
what do you got , riley?
nothing .
i'm going to have my own place , man .
my own goddamn place .
you're dreaming , cholo .
they won't let you in there .
they wouldn't let me in there .
we're the wrong kind .
yeah , well , we'll see .
<i>isn't it time? </ i>
<i>isn't it your time? </ i>
<i>for fiddler's green? </ i>
demora , supplies unit .
what's in them boxes?
essential supplies .
for kaufman .
<i>mark your calendars . </ i>
<i>mr .
kaufman</ i> <i>cordially invites ... </ i> <i>residents of the green</ i> <i>to a masked ball ... </ i> <i>on the eve of allhallows . </ i>
<i>it is strictly forbidden</ i> <i>to come as you are . </ i>
it's expensive .
look at that .
you like it?
i could tell .
can i ask you to stop , sir?
quitting time , deke .
you're going to need this to get back in .
when i said quitting time , i meant quitting time .
hey , baby .
the only way to the father , is through me , " sayeth the lord .
so , riley , you want to go get a drink?
just look at me .
you can tell i could use a drink .
you know , charlie , why don't you go ahead?
i'll catch up .
where are you going?
i got to see a man about a car .
a car?
all right .
here's the deal .
rivers protect us on two sides .
bridges are all blocked up .
the only overland access is here , called the " throat .
and these fences go all the way across?
half a mile , both ways .
stench .
high noon .
shit .
they don't come around here much anymore .
it's like they've learned they can't get in .
take his fucking face off .
how long are you going to let kaufman push you around?
you like shining his shoes , pressing his pants?
he didn't build that place .
he just took it over .
kept the best for himself , and left us with a slum to live in .
but if there's enough of us , if all of you would join up ... we could make this a fit place to live in .
dad , look who's here .
riley denbo !
i used to work with him .
bringing in toothpicks for the bastards to pick at their gums .
and food and other stuff , for all of us .
come in with us , riley .
both of you .
together we'd be unstoppable .
no one's unstoppable , mulligan .
you're worried about being locked out .
now , you see that?
i can't help but think we're all locked in .
i'm looking for a world where there's no fences .
here .
antibiotics for your boy .
thanks .
you all right , son?
i'm fine , dad .
hey , easy , easy , knipp !
easy .
mr. demora .
mr. kaufman isn't home .
and i heard ...
that .
i called security .
they should be here .
yeah , i got it .
where are you?
oh , shit .
oh , god , he killed himself .
all right , lady , i need you to down , okay?
try to keep it together .
who are you?
are you security?
no , i'm not security .
then , who the hell are you?
i work for kaufman .
all right , lady , i just need you to calm down , please .
what are you doing with that?
lady , you know what i have to do .
i'm sorry .
dad !
he's gonna turn , lady .
no , he won't .
please .
no , he's okay .
please , we don't have a choice .
don't make this anymore difficult than it has to be .
he's gonna turn , don't do this !
what's happening?
shut up .
hey , kid .
what the hell's going on here?
it's your problem .
clean it up .
hey , lady , it's okay .
what did you do to my car?
what car?
the last car i drove out of this town was three years ago .
no , i bought a car .
it was right there yesterday .
there were two guys working on it .
there was nobody here this morning .
son of a bitch .
what happened , riley?
did you get fucked?
come with me .
you got fucked .
roach .
hey , how's it going?
i've been better .
where's chihuahua?
around the back .
come on !
lot of action in here today .
we've got a new kind of game .
what are they betting on?
black and red .
who wins the fight .
stenches don't fight .
they do when there's food .
what's on the menu , cat or dog?
i told you , today it's something new .
who do you want , black or red? $60 on black .
what the fuck happened to my car?
they're fixing it up .
no , i went to the garage .
there's nothing there .
your guys aren't there , and my car is not there .
this is not me .
i do not do this to you .
i'm your friend .
well , be my friend and get my fucking car back ... or i'll have to carry you out of here inside that fucking hat .
this guy could be trouble .
keep him busy .
give a drink .
let me have my gun .
supply run last night , huh?
i heard you got some money .
not interested .
i'll show you how to turn that money into more ...
i said i'm not interested .
jesus !
fuck !
my suit .
he ruined my fucking suit !
shit .
i'm all right .
thank you .
thank you .
i've seen you around .
i've seen you around , too , working the streets .
you were checking me out?
what the hell happened here?
someone shot the little fat man .
i see that .
you're under arrest .
hey .
what?
why you?
why'd the little fat man throw you in there with them things?
wasn't the little man .
it was the big man .
mr. k.
he's got his fingers in everything here .
if you can drink it , shoot it up ... fuck it , gamble on it , it belongs to him .
didn't answer the question .
he asked you why .
i know what he asked me .
they found out i was helping out mulligan and his people ... tired of eating bones while he's having a steak .
me , too , but every place is the same .
places with people .
i'm going to find a place where there's no people .
north .
canada .
if you get a way out ...
i'm coming with you .
no , riley likes to be alone .
he might take me , 'cause he says ... having me around is pretty much the same as being alone .
and 'cause i can make myself useful , and i can shoot .
i can shoot .
i can be pretty fucking useful .
i had training .
i was going to join the army , help the green ... till somebody figured i'd be a better hooker than a soldier .
you know , i don't want to hear your fucking story .
everyone's got a story , and i am sick of hearing them .
what's your story , riley?
i don't have one .
nothing bad ever happened to me till everything changed .
everything changed for all of us .
hey , mulligan .
what they going to do?
kill him?
not right away .
first they'll try to get him to talk .
about people like me .
mr. demora .
boss .
how was uniontown?
dead .
death intrudes on us even here in the city , i'm afraid .
i heard abut what happened with my neighbors .
and i'm grateful for your help .
that's what i'm here for , boss ... to take care of any problems you got .
look , i got you a little present , a little souvenir from town .
i know you're used to better vintage than this ... but it's the best we got .
little champers to take the edge off things .
there we go .
this is very extravagant .
yeah , well , i can afford it .
with the $20, 000 you owe me from last night ... and the money from all the other nights together ...
i got enough for my own place .
you mean here in the green?
sure , why not?
i'm sorry , mr. demora ... but there's a very long waiting list .
how long?
well ... this is an extremely desirable location .
space is very limited .
you mean restricted , don't you?
i do have a board of directors ... and i have a membership committee .
they have to approve .
don't do this to me .
don't .
how long have i been working for you?
three years?
taking out your garbage , cleaning up after you ... and then you're going to say i'm not good enough?
let me tell you something , you're going to let me in ... because i know what goes on around here .
do your committee members know ... what the fuck is going out with the garbage?
so , you're gonna let me in , you hear me?
maybe we could talk about this when you're a little less excited .
i won't be needing this man anymore .
take that , you scary zombie .
... come back to god .
give up your lives of sin .
praise the lord !
father is the only way .
come back to jesus .
fox , get the guys .
we're going out .
want me to call riley?
forget riley .
just us .
come on .
thanks .
shit , man .
you win .
you got him right in the brain .
that's right .
double or nothing .
brubaker , who'd you blow to get this cushy job?
cholo , you bum , how's it going?
where's riley?
he's retired .
we're taking the truck out .
that's from yesterday .
what?
you're shitting me .
i'm gonna quit drinking , man .
what the hell is that?
relax .
it's just target practice .
barrett , stop scratching around back there .
you're going to fuck up my shot .
i'm not doing nothing , man , i'm just standing here .
there's nothing there , man .
so , what the hell is that , screaming practice?
<i> stenches ! </ i>
<i>they're all over the place . </ i>
let's make our move .
come on .
all right , go .
their eyes .
mouse , take that .
cholo , should we send up some sky flowers?
it ain't our fight , fox .
the stenches want to get in , let them in .
come on .
everybody , get busy .
that's our way out .
should we do something about this?
that's our way out , get us there .
no .
get out of here !
no !
<i>kaufman . </ i>
the one that got away .
<i>that's right . </ i>
<i>remember you said we should talk</ i> <i>when i was less excited? </ i>
<i>i'm a lot less excited</ i> <i>right now . </ i>
what do you want , mr. demora?
you might have noticed that i had to leave in a hurry ... so i didn't get a chance to take my money out of your bank .
i'd like you to handle that withdrawal for me .
with interest : $5 million .
or i'm gonna blow you out of your fucking castle .
because i got dead reckoning .
that's unfortunate .
<i>well , unfortunate for you, </ i> <i>perhaps . </ i>
<i>i want you to put that money</ i> <i>on a boat ... </ i> <i>and send it across the river to the south side, </ i> <i>10th street pier . </ i>
<i>one man to drive the boat, </ i> <i>no more . </ i>
you have till midnight , that's two and a half hours .
i won't be there , and dead reckoning won't be there .
but i'll know if it happens , and i'll know if it doesn't happen .
copy?
trouble?
in a world where the dead are returning to life ... the world " trouble " loses much of its meaning .
he wants money .
pay him .
we don't negotiate with terrorists .
we have other options .
denbo .
give me denbo .
get up .
you're coming with me .
where you taking him?
don't worry .
where are you taking him?
you take care of him?
hell , yeah .
he pulled me out of the fire .
it was bad .
just look at me , you can tell it was bad .
mr. denbo , can i offer you a drink?
i don't drink .
why am i here?
we want you to repossess a vehicle that belongs to us ... a vehicle that you designed , mr. denbo .
dead reckoning has been stolen by your second in command ... who i want captured or killed ... and i want my $2 million piece of equipment returned .
my truck .
my truck , which has guns .
powerful guns .
it'll do a great deal of damage ... if they're aimed at this city .
why don't you just send out your troops?
i can send 50 men against that thing ... and they'd come back in body bags .
now , cholo was your man .
maybe you can get close enough to do what has to be done .
it's a good thing i'm still in town .
see , i bought a car .
i was going to drive out of here , but it disappeared .
i guess someone didn't want me to leave .
you're a very popular man .
how much are your services going to cost me?
a vehicle , enough weapons and ammunition to go north .
but there's nothing up north .
that's the idea .
my friends , they go with me .
take them .
can you find dead reckoning , quickly?
how quickly?
midnight .
i have a way .
be born , die , and we all know the other one , don't we?
yeah , okay , cholo .
just don't leave me here alone too long ...
two hours max .
give me a call .
let me know if we're rich or not .
all right , two hours .
give him something for the nerves .
something for the nerves .
stay real .
okay .
can't believe you guys are turning me into a fucking boy scout .
not a boy .
you don't have to come out if you don't want to .
i didn't say that .
some shit , though , going out to save kaufman's ass .
i'm not doing this for kaufman .
this is for the people in the city .
what do you think's going to happen to them if cholo shells the green?
okay .
i'm with you .
no , i like the ones i already got .
this piece fires 14 rounds a second .
i don't normally need that many .
i don't normally talk to retards .
pretty easy to make fun of some people , huh?
i could make a whole lot of fun out of you .
i'll take this one .
he thinks he's taking care of you .
he does .
without his guns , i'd be dead by now .
without you , he'd be dead by now .
fair trade .
riley , these guys are coming .
gentlemen and lady .
mr. kaufman thought you could use some support .
don't need any .
nevertheless .
manolete .
manolete , named after the bullfighter .
monica .
you can call me motown .
pillsbury .
i'm here to do something .
why are we standing around?
let's do something .
we taking the jeep?
the woody .
it's bigger , has guns .
jeez .
cholo made a mess .
no .
cholo didn't do all this .
this is stenches .
a lot of them .
maybe still here .
that's where they came in .
look .
that's where they went out .
trying to get to the city .
i'm going to go get the ammo .
crank up the woody , charlie .
make sure she doesn't hurt herself .
i can take care of myself , okay?
fine .
charlie , make sure she doesn't hurt anyone else .
you , come with me .
<i>walkers , mr. denbo? </ i>
and moving toward the city .
<i>they'll never get across the river . </ i>
i wouldn't be so sure .
<i> they learned</ i> <i>how to work together . </ i>
they're mindless walking corpses ... and many of us will be , too ... if you don't stay focused on the task at hand .
zombies , man .
they creep me out .
do you really think they can get across the water?
if you asked me that a week ago , i would have said no .
but now ...
one way or the other , we got to get our hands on dead reckoning .
there's more of them out there .
i can hear them .
they're always out there .
you're all right?
yeah , no problem .
woody's in there .
who's got the keys , guys?
no keys to get .
melted .
screw the keys .
let's just hot wire the fucking thing .
yellow to red .
what the fuck does a samoan know about hot wiring a fucking car?
fifty thousand cars stolen in samoa every year .
yeah?
well , a million in detroit .
detroit's got 50 million cars .
50, 000 .
every one stolen .
charlie .
why do you lick your rifle?
it catches the light .
what light?
how can you see anything?
good eye .
hey .
charlie?
shit !
off center , but i got him .
awesome , man .
got a flashlight?
yeah .
brubaker?
hey , brubaker?
brubaker , you there?
hear that?
yeah .
all right , keep that thing shining .
let's get ammo .
there's .
50 caliber around here somewhere .
great .
here's the .
50 .
jesus christ .
no , not in here .
think about where we are .
take a breath .
choose your shots .
we're even .
not .
that hurt .
i didn't hurt you .
i got it .
oh , god .
is he bit?
yeah .
go !
how long does he have?
had a little brother bit .
he took less than an hour before he turned .
and then what happened?
i shot him .
you said nothing bad ever happened to you .
that happened to my brother .
yeah .
dead is dead .
and that ain't you or me .
i'm sorry .
no !
no !
i recognize that some of you are concerned ... and i wanna assure you ... that if anything goes wrong , measures have been taken .
i've established outposts with food and supplies ... that will support us on our way .
on our way to where?
anywhere that we want to go .
alternative sites have been chosen for us and our families ... as well as necessary support personnel .
what about all the others?
all the others can be replaced by others .
boss .
you're interrupting me , bill .
it's bad timing .
just when i was talking about how people can be replaced .
a day may come when you earn yourself some responsibilities .
but right now the responsibilities are mine .
they're all mine .
it was my ingenuity that took an old world ... and made it into something new .
i put up the fences to make it safe .
i hired the soldiers and paid for their training .
i kept the people off the streets by giving them games and vices ... which cost me money .
but i spend it because the responsibility is mine .
now , do you understand the meaning of the word responsibility?
we have to do what we have to do .
foxy , i know i'm never gonna be great .
i'm never gonna be on the list of names of people ... who done great things because i don't do anything .
not one thing .
if it wasn't for this truck , i wouldn't be any different ... than that poor mexican bastard out there .
cholo , look , kaufman might not pay .
kaufman's gonna pay , man .
but if he doesn't , he knows i'm gonna do a jihad on his ass .
when you hit route 6 , take a right .
how do you know which way to go?
homing device .
cool .
how long since you been out here?
i've never been out .
i've lived in the city since it was a real city .
pull over .
cover them , charlie .
all right , you're working for kaufman , i'm working for kaufman .
my job is to stop cholo .
your job is to bring the truck back , with or without me , right?
not without you , no .
well , that means yes .
here's what's going to happen .
i'm going to do my job .
you're not going to get to do yours .
kaufman is never going to see dead reckoning again .
and when i get it , i'm gonna do what i want with it .
anyone has any problems with that , you can get out right here .
some choice .
no choice .
close door .
keep them covered , charlie .
wait .
you made us come all the way out here ... just to steal a fucking truck?
you made a deal , riley .
you're going back on a deal .
you never done that before .
if cholo shells the green , all deals are off .
if something worse happens , i don't know about you ... but i don't want to be out here in a car without a roof .
mouse , you got anything?
no boat , no money , no nothing .
load the six packs .
six pack loaded .
all right , load the other six .
we're not gonna show them any goddamn mercy .
i know where cholo's going .
where?
mount washington , overlooks the city .
we can beat him there .
in that truck , he's gotta take the main roads .
we can take the back streets .
right .
make a right on ivy , then take a left on westminster .
you wanna go up the hill?
yes , i'm wanna go up the hill .
let's go up the hill .
almost midnight , sir .
pack us up .
we might be leaving .
in the boat?
i'd rather be taking dead reckoning ... but not available .
from this hillside , they can shell the green .
they're gonna be coming up this road .
pull in around the corner .
all right , they're coming .
you guys stay here and keep real quiet .
i'm going to try and talk my way inside .
he's going to steal that truck and leave us here .
riley would never do that .
just look at him , you can tell he'd never do that .
i like that man .
you , go help him .
go .
everything's okay back there .
it's too late to send me back .
now , put that thing away .
put on your best sunday smile , and just try to look friendly .
i am friendly .
hey , cholo .
take a look at this .
it's denbo and his idiot .
all right .
stop the truck .
come on , here .
so , how did you get up here?
in the woody .
i tracked you with this .
forgot to tell you ... the truck's got a little transmitter in her belly .
you were always a smart guy .
<i>always a lot smarter</ i> <i>than me , man . </ i>
that's not saying much .
open up .
what , are you fucking nuts?
open up .
hey , charlie .
so , who's the smart one now?
thought you would have quit ... but here you are still working for the man , aren't you , riley?
what?
kaufman sent you up to take care of me?
yeah .
takes a true friend to stab you right in the front , doesn't it?
that man pulls the trigger , he's dead .
who else is out there?
kaufman sent some guys with us .
we took care of them .
cover him .
pretty boy , lock in the target .
we're running out of time .
i got you now .
you hit that tower square on ... you're gonna kill a lot of innocent people .
you miss , you hit the city , you're gonna kill a lot of our friends .
want to know who killed our friends?
kaufman is the one that's killed our friends .
every time i took out his garbage , i took out one of our friends ... people he wanted off the streets .
he turned me into a goon , then he's gonna piss all over me?
i don't think so .
what are you gonna get out of this , cholo?
hopefully my money .
money burns .
yeah , not if it's in a vault .
all right , mr. k. , won't be needing you anymore .
you set this right?
yes .
riley , you did something to it with your fucking little toy .
this?
what the fuck did you do?
fix it .
fix it .
not a fucking chance .
cholo , look out .
fuck .
you know , riley ... there's something about you that i've always really hated .
you're still here , aren't you?
what do you care?
you got what you wanted .
you're hit .
how you doing in there , charlie?
i'm being friendly .
what's in the bags?
money .
whose money?
watch out .
get down .
quick .
ours .
yes?
we got cholo .
<i>kaufman . </ i>
i'm here .
i just did something ...
i might not have done otherwise .
you lied to me , denbo .
you didn't get demora .
he's shooting at us .
<i>that's not cholo , mr. kaufman . </ i>
holy shit .
they got across the river .
look at that .
i didn't even have to blow the place up .
the fucking stenches did it for me .
we're going back to the city to see if we can help .
pick him up .
where we going , man?
what are we doing?
easy , gargantua , come on .
get him inside .
quick .
not this horse .
not this horse .
take that woody if you still got it .
fine .
you got me , too .
thanks .
anyone else?
where you gonna go , cholo?
there's always that outpost in cleveland .
haven't heard from them in a while .
take my chances .
you have no right .
no right .
woody's around the corner .
guns and ammo inside .
thanks .
get us back on the main road .
you have blood , here .
we almost lost you there .
you all right?
yeah .
you want to be really helpful , roll me one .
yeah , all right .
what was built to keep people safe is gonna trap them inside .
<i> this is denbo</ i> <i>in the reckoning . </ i>
<i>open up those fences</ i> <i>and let the people out . </ i>
the fences are still hot .
we can't cut the juice from here .
we've been trying to call the power station .
there's no one left over there .
we got to get the fuck out of here .
there's no one left here , either .
move it .
we can rocket those fences .
got to get across river .
the bridges into the city , they're all bricked up .
let's just fucking blast our way through .
no , we can't do that .
there's a war going on over there .
we cross any of these bridges ... we're gonna end up right in the middle of it .
we have to come in outside of the throat .
somehow , fox , i thought we'd be traveling ... in a lot better style than this , baby .
at least we're still fucking traveling , brother .
what?
come on , fox , let's get the hell out of here .
what?
can you fucking believe it?
nothing works out the way you want it to .
there's something always comes around the corner and just gets you .
it's your choice , bro .
i always wanted to see how the other half lives .
the old j& l can take us over .
it's a drawbridge .
they leave it up .
that means it's not guarded .
can you get us there?
yeah .
let's go .
i can stay with you , if you want .
no .
no .
this is between me and the man .
fox , she's all yours .
hope you do better than you did with me , man .
yeah .
holy shit !
<i> a disturbance</ i> <i>has been reported ... </ i> <i>on the outskirts of the city . </ i>
<i>there's no reason</ i> <i>to believe ... </ i> <i>that fiddler's green</ i> <i>could ever be compromised . </ i>
<i>but we suggest that residents report any sightings</ i> <i>of unusual behavior . </ i>
there it is .
let's hope it's still wired into the grid .
shut the hatch , just in case .
when i get the bridge down , you come pick me up .
how do you work this thing?
it's just like a video game .
what the fuck are you doing?
<i>making myself useful . </ i>
wait .
wait .
stop .
stop !
stenches .
starboard .
they're behind us , too .
i can't get a shot .
now shoot !
they'll never get in here .
neither will riley .
unlock the roof hatch , pretty boy .
oh , shit .
<i> riley , go for the roof . </ i>
okay .
roll !
what are you doing?
forward !
i'm gonna shake these bastards .
get out of the way .
hello?
hello?
what is it?
is something going on?
stenches !
we're fucked .
angle the mortars for the throat ... and send up some sky flowers .
got her !
oh , thank god .
watch it now .
oh , my god .
downstairs .
the car .
you bastards !
you have no right !
mr. kaufman , come on , let's go .
<i> mr. kaufman</ i> <i>wants you to know ... </ i>
all right , we're going to the boat . <i> ... he has dedicated himself</ i> <i>to your well being . </ i>
be careful when you open that door .
should i call the crew , sir?
no , i'll call them .
god damn it .
what the fuck?
goodbye , mr. k.
come back here , you son of a bitch .
you got the fucking keys .
fucking spic bastard .
nah .
you're dead .
oh , my god .
you are dead .
number 1's clear .
going for number 2 .
i don't normally need that many .
don't bother .
come on down .
blow the fences .
sky flowers don't work no more .
shoot .
but there's people .
those people are all dead .
shoot , charlie .
we're too late .
no .
look .
you saved them .
you staying or leaving?
you?
leaving .
unless you need my help .
no .
why don't you stick around?
we could turn this place into what we always wanted it to be .
maybe .
then what will we turn into?
we'll see , won't we?
you want to go to canada now , riley?
sure , if no one has any objections .
no , we'll take you with us .
i'll try to make myself useful .
anchor , load the guns .
we're hitting the road .
now we can go .
no .
they're just looking for a place to go .
same as us .
fire off what's left inside those tubes .
we're not gonna need it anymore .
take us north .
