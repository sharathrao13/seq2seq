dr. weinberger ... ... the data i'm getting on se 2020 via the dss shows ... ... that it's moving out of the scheduled orbit .
punch up se 2020 , with coordinates .
check the orbit deviation and alert canberra .
i'll be right there .
we've lost the satellite over queensland .
they self destruct if they stray from orbit .
canberra lost it when we did .
order a copy of all transmissions to dsn stations in the last 24 hours .
it landed , and then australia lost transmission .
looks like the u. s. government has a problem in australia .
oh , crikey !
terri , get the catching bag !
these lizards are like land crocodiles !
their teeth are like tiger sharks !
and if you get too close , they'll towel whack you !
you're a slippery little guy .
what a steamer !
close !
not only can they run like blazes , but they can also scale these sharp rocks ... ... like it's going out of fashion .
this is his territory .
up there he'll have a couple good looking sheilas ... ... just waiting for him .
he gave me the slip .
that's all right .
have a look at this !
poo !
perentie poo !
what a beauty !
that's some good perentie poo .
it can tell me a lot about the animal .
what we've got in here is pig's ear ... ... snake skin ... ... a little bit of lizard skin .
and check this out !
a lizard claw !
from another lizard .
the perentie is the master .
he sits up here in the escarpment , watching from his nice cool tunnel .
watching .
waiting .
sees a bit of movement .
they can spot movement from 300 meters away !
way down there in the sand dunes .
spots it .
goes down .
waits .
runs out !
strikes !
lacerates !
then swallows it whole and comes back up here into its cool retreat .
this is really important .
i'm going to save it for later .
we're here in the outback on a field study trip for the zoo ... ... hoping to find some of australia's more unlovable creatures for research .
here's your poo , mate .
we're heading for snake country !
australia is home to the most venomous snakes in the world .
and with a bit of luck , we'll find some .
okay , sui , in the truck .
this is going to be a great adventure !
you all right , mate?
you never know what's out there .
wheeler .
archer .
must be good if they got us in here at 3 : 00 a . m .
ron .
wheeler .
good to see you .
at 2200 hours , east coast time ... ... a u. s. satellite was terminated over australia ... ... due to mechanical failure .
the primary function of this device was intelligence collection .
gentlemen .
thanks for coming in at such short notice .
the downed satellite collected sensitive photographic data .
the equivalent of a million images are stored inside the hard drive of this .
the black box .
a beacon .
an alpha proton beacon .
developed for a mars mission .
designed to withstand landing in the most extreme conditions conceivable .
i didn't know any were operational .
as far as we are concerned , none are .
we have every reason to believe that the beacon survived .
if it ends up in the wrong hands ... ... it has enough documentation to change the power structure ... ... of the entire modern world .
have you picked up any signal?
australia has , twice in the last four hours .
that's encouraging .
it's inconsistent .
either there's damage , or someone's beaten us to the site .
we'll hope for damage .
we're leaking word of a routine parts pick up .
standard satellite junk .
we can't risk tipping anyone to the potential of this .
translation?
you'll only have basic local support .
one operative .
so it's really on the two of you .
you leave first thing in the morning .
north queensland .
australia .
thank god it's a friendly country .
leave ... ... my cows alone !
think you're going to get away with it that easy?
i don't think so !
this is private property !
you dirty , rotten , stinking mongrel !
no .
poor daisy .
you no good ... ... cattle stealing ... ... handbag .
now , go on , nick off !
get down .
down .
what do you want?
call off your dogs , and i'll let you know .
i'd offer you a cold drink , but i don't want you to stay .
i know since otis died that you've had a hard time on your own
you don't know anything about me .
i know you've been shooting up a storm at the river .
i've had calls .
this could get you into a serious amount of trouble .
how come it's illegal for me to kill a croc ... ... but not for a croc to kill my cows?
the law is the law .
you must work within the legal boundaries .
you work within them .
i'll work with a shotgun .
i'm warning you .
i'll find a solution .
don't do something you'll regret .
you're here , so i guess i already have .
now , rack off , sam !
get your scrawny bottom back in that truck .
come on .
chop chop .
you're trespassing on my land .
i mean it , brozzie .
so do i.
it's croc killing time .
it's croc saving time !
we've had to interrupt our great adventure ... ... to help some local fishermen with a problem crocodile .
come on , sui .
in this case , the crocodile sees the fishermen as the source of its food supply .
and this young tacker has been getting very cheeky .
the last few months a crocodile has been causing trouble around here ... ... where people are swimming .
when the blokes come back from fishing ... ... they filet their fish , throw the scraps in the water ... ... and that encourages the croc to hang around .
now everybody who comes down here ... ... is scared the croc's going to have a go at them .
as the world population explodes ... ... our wildlife is under increasing pressure to survive ... ... as natural habitat diminishes every single day .
our job is to locate the croc , jump it , try and get it into the boat ... ... then relocate it so that it will never run into conflict with people again .
now , it's not the croc's fault .
he doesn't come into our swimming pool .
we're actually going into his .
they're apex predators at the top of the food chain .
without crocodiles the whole ecosystem would suffer .
we've got to catch this croc .
otherwise they'll shoot it dead and turn it into boots , bags and belts .
during the day , a crocodile in this river can remain almost invisible .
but when night falls , our spotlights should lead us to him like a signpost .
and i'll face the added danger of having to catch this crocodile by hand .
steve's been catching crocodiles this way with his dad since he was a boy .
the dangerous part is judging the size of the croc before jumping it .
we're looking for eye shine .
crocodiles are ambush predators .
they rely on camouflage .
but in the spotlight , their eyes shine bright red ... ... which enables us to sneak right up on them .
got it , mate !
keep your spottie right on it .
get around .
here is a battle of strength and endurance .
the only way to toss this croc is to wear him out .
he's got the strength of three blokes my size !
get the jaw rope !
our only means of restraining him is via a top jaw rope .
get her with a top jaw rope !
it's critical to get his top jaw secured .
lassoing those gnashing , thrashing teeth doesn't come easy .
get it on !
he's thrashing too hard !
if i loosen my grip , he'll rip me to shreds .
go !
i got it .
hang onto her .
i'll tie her off .
the second top jaw rope is not on really good .
protect sui .
get the top jaw rope .
too easy , mate .
i called you in because you're an aussie .
i have an important assignment for you .
the cla is sending two undercover field operatives ... ... to australia to retrieve the se 2020's data recorder .
isn't satellite surveillance your department's domain?
it is .
but reynolds got the jump on me .
he bypassed the national reconnaissance office ... ... before i could respond .
he's after the top job , and this could just give him the edge over me .
what do you want me to do?
get the beacon before archer and wheeler .
australia's main industries are mining and agriculture .
coal is the most important resource , followed by copper , lead and bauxite .
that's a decent cover .
let's go with mineral exploration .
we're taking the mobile antenna?
yeah .
this sure doesn't look like your average satellite recovery situation .
the aussie contact won't figure it out .
well ... ... this is all i need .
come on .
there's nothing that's gonna hurt you in australia .
this is the fierce snake .
come here , mate .
the most venomous snake in the world !
this is one wild unit .
this is the snake you don't want to get tagged by ... ... because it possesses enough venom ... ... to kill 150, 000 rats .
but who cares?
this bloke could have enough venom in one bite ... ... to kill a hundred blokes my size .
look at the coloration .
beautiful coloration .
settle down , mate .
you wouldn't want to take a whack off a snake this size .
you can see his venom glands behind his head .
this right here is where you see the work of my dad .
he taught me to be one on one with the snake .
to be at one with it .
to feel it in my fingers .
to allow the snake to feel that it's in no danger .
settle down , sweetheart .
settle down now .
she's just trying to tag steve o on the face .
i know you are , sweetheart .
you're a beautiful snake .
you're absolutely gorgeous .
it's starting to flatten its throat out .
it's starting to get aggressive .
you're all right , mate .
settle down .
see , it's coming back on me .
real fast .
these snakes seem to know the toxicity of their own venom .
it's swinging around , agitated , neck puffing up .
that rapid tongue flicking .
it's getting upset .
make no doubt about it , it'd whack its fangs into me at any given moment .
see how it keeps lining me up?
it's really grumpy .
beautiful snake !
you're just a little grumpy now .
they're just like people .
she just wants to move away from me .
many people think snakes are evil monsters cruising around killing people .
those fangs are like hypodermic needles .
two hypodermic needles sitting in the back of their head , ready to ....
settle down , sweetheart .
how was that for a swing?
straight at me !
look at these flies .
right in me eyes !
it's so dry and hot out here ... ... the flies are coming into my eyes for a drink !
any form of moisture .
she's starting to settle down now .
look at this .
nice and quiet .
look at her .
what a beauty .
i call it " her " because i'm in love with her .
she knows i mean her no harm .
what a beautiful snake .
you know , i'm a professional .
if you see a snake like this , don't muck with it .
and one thing's for sure , don't try this at home !
far too dangerous .
this snake could have enough venom to kill me ... ... and a hundred other blokes out here in the west .
what an honor to share territory ... ... to share space , with such a beautiful animal !
steamer .
i've got to tell you ... ... i'd rather deal with this snake ... ... than a lot of people i know .
i reckon that people are much more dangerous .
no questions?
gentlemen , that concludes this briefing .
reynolds , do you have a second?
sure .
i was surprised with the selection of the australian mission .
surprised or disappointed?
both .
the second member should have been from my department .
wheeler will do fine .
fine isn't what my division aims for .
wheeler has excellent support .
i have no doubts they'll succeed .
so you won't be offended if i keep a close eye on the situation?
there's a line .
we'll both know if you've crossed over it .
brozzie .
brozzie .
sugar !
get away !
get away !
shoo !
brozzie !
get away !
shoo , doggies !
go away , dogs !
shoo !
go home !
brozzie .
don't bother getting out .
i won't .
good .
perfectly content to stay here , thanks .
what is it this time?
i've got good news for you .
you've been fired?
no , i've found some experts for us on crocs .
unless they work in a belt factory , i'm not interested .
the irwins are relocation specialists .
really?
i could have them over for afternoon tea .
throw a nice big croc on the barbie .
the main office is contacting them .
tell the main office i'll be contacting a croc on my own , thank you .
come on , brozzie , they're experts .
go on , nick off !
sugar .
i see you've been feeding my dogs .
what's the aussie guy's name?
joe buckley .
jo buckley .
welcome to queensland .
vaughan archer .
bob wheeler .
looks like an interesting place .
we always say we've got something here for everyone .
any immediate requests?
no , thanks .
we're anxious to get on the road .
vehicle looks good .
what's the story with this?
kangaroos .
roo bars or bull bars ... ... are often the cause of sudden death for wildlife here in the outback .
millions of animals die every year from collisions with vehicles .
kangaroos , in particular , are getting clobbered all over the bush .
what a shame !
and this is a tragedy that we see all too often ... ... out here on the outback roads in australia .
part of our job is to pull the carcass back off the road ... ... so that any wildlife that comes to feed on it ... ... doesn't get clobbered by another vehicle .
steve , she's got a joey .
come here .
we might have a chance to save her baby .
there's a girl .
she feels cold .
does she?
i'll nurse her .
whip your shirt off , we'll give her something warm to cuddle up in .
a joey this size would never fend for herself .
she'll need us to help her survive .
we've been adoptive parents for joey kangaroos for many , many years .
we successfully raised them ... ... and got them back out into the wilds where they belong .
but they take a heck of a lot of nurturing and caring .
you all right?
let's go , girls .
you're kicking !
we're prepared for any wildlife emergency .
we have to feed her just like a baby every couple of hours around the clock .
here we go , sweetheart .
you ready?
okay , just like in mama's pouch .
upside down .
this will teach you to go after my cows , you no good , rotten crocodile .
a nice , juicy chicken for you .
how long will you need with all this stuff?
hooking up with the network ... ... will tell me if the problem is the beacon or just our equipment .
it won't take long to set up the antenna .
need some help?
i got it covered .
what about you?
he's the technical guy .
i'm the strategy .
as long as we've got some down time , why don't you and i ....
i'll get some rest .
here .
you'll need that .
right here on the ground?
there's nothing out here to worry about .
this is the bird eating spider !
the largest arachnid in australia !
i'm going to get a stick , because she is poisonous !
see that movement?
these guys are ambush predators .
they launch themselves onto their prey , hang onto it with their front legs ... ... and drive their fangs right into it !
see how her legs are up?
look .
that's not the spider shaking .
that's me shaking !
these things make me nervous .
and here's why .
see her little legs sticking up?
you're all right , sweetheart .
crikey !
what they do is wait for their food source to come to them .
crikey !
ant just bit me on the back .
this is scary .
i'm so nervous .
they wait down in their hole until the cool of night comes ... ... then they climb out of their hole ... ... and sit at the front of the hole , just like this ... ... in the full ambush position .
you all right , sweetheart?
there she is .
just like that .
ready .
any animal that she can overpower and kill with her venom , that's her target .
animals like mice , frogs , lizards , geckos ... ... small birds , grasshoppers , anything comes past .
she'll wait in the ambush position , fly out of the hole , grab it ... ... and , whack , drive those huge great fangs right into its chest cavity !
they've got very toxic venom , super toxic venom , and a lot of it !
their fangs are larger than a snake's !
crikey , they're powerful !
sometimes , they'll actually kill their prey ... ... just with the force , the ferocity , of that hit when the fangs go in .
that's how powerful they are .
let me just see if i can demonstrate her fangs .
get out of my eyes , flies .
not now !
come on , buddy .
come on , sweetheart .
you're all right , babe .
stop there , babe .
a strike .
that was a strike .
i upset her .
this is nature's way .
she's a grumpy girl .
she's a beautiful sheila , actually .
show us your fangs .
right there !
have a look at the size of these things !
look at that !
driving them into the stick !
you can feel them grinding into the stick .
has she got a set of fangs , or what?
have a go at that !
look !
there they are , bigger than most of the australian snakes 'fangs .
she just injected a bit of venom there .
sorry , sweetheart .
that " whoa ! " my breath , scared her ... ... and she got nervous and had a strike .
have a go at this .
look .
look at the venom on that stick .
real syrupy thick venom !
and she'd have a lot of it .
we should get this girl back to australia zoo ... ... so we can do research on the toxicity of the venom .
and that will give us an indication of how we can best look after them ... ... and this entire environment .
she's a beautiful girl , all right .
really nice .
but whatever you do , don't ever try and wrangle a spider .
i'd hate to get this amount of venom stuck into my veins .
i reckon it would be one heck of a rough journey .
could even kill me .
hey , terri !
can you get a container?
i got a big bird eater , mate !
breeding season is a real bummer for the male bird eating spider ... ... because after they mate , the female kills and eats him .
come on , sweetheart .
throw the lid on , mate .
careful , steve .
they say i've got nerves of steel , except when i'm dealing with spiders .
have a go at this .
in this hole i reckon we're onto something .
what we've got here is a beautiful hole .
you can see tripwires out in front .
here's one , two , three .
and that's what stimulates the spider to , whammo , strike and hit .
good hole !
it's not completely understood why or how ... ... they build these holes .
just kidding .
if we have a look down in there , here's a chamber .
and here's what was in the chamber .
pretty well busted up .
couple of fang marks in the abdomen there .
she's had a feed on this bloke !
this was actually her husband .
he probably mated with her over the last couple of days or nights .
whammo !
i'm finished with you .
it seems pretty harsh , but this is nature's way .
we were heading further into the outback ... ... when a call from the department of fauna and fisheries ... ... suddenly changed our plans .
the local ranger , sam flynn ... ... is having a problem with a rogue crocodile ... ... on a river just north of here , and he needs our help .
it seems a big croc has been giving a rancher a hard time ... ... and the situation is way out of hand .
the wildlife service needs our help .
it sounds like the rancher is tough .
real tough .
and the croc sounds good .
real good .
from what we've heard , someone needs to be relocated .
we could go in at night , shine a light in the rancher's eyes ... ... jump her and throw her in the boat ... ... wrap a rope around her head , and then take her to a new river system .
but we're not that brave .
we're going after the croc !
rack off !
nick off , come on !
i'll get you , you rotten ....
show us your eyes .
come on .
now i got you ... ... you mongrel !
oh , dear .
everything okay?
i lost it again .
thanks .
either it's damaged or it's in the river .
submersion in water would affect transmission .
our inflatable has a decent outboard motor .
and i have a depth finder and an underwater scanner .
so if we end up fishing for it , we're covered .
you aussies think of everything .
what did you bring to protect us from alligators?
crocodiles in this country .
same thing .
hardly .
you'll know it if you meet a croc .
it's back !
snake !
have a go at this whopper !
this is a king ....
king brown .
babe , get the catching bag !
you can see why they call him king brown .
this is a snake rescue .
we need to take him with us ... ... and set him up somewhere where he won't conflict with cars .
nuts !
king brown snake .
member of the black snake family .
comes out here onto the road ... ... trying to get some sunlight and heat up in the morning .
see the way he flattens his neck out?
that typical cobra neck flattening?
what he's doing is saying , " i'm venomous ...
... i'm wild , and i'll bite you !
did you see that?
wouldn't want a bite around here .
their venom is highly necrotic .
that means you rot and things drop off .
i'd hate to get bitten there .
steady , mate .
you're all right .
and this snake species actually has ... ... the highest venom yield ... ... of any snake in australia .
pretty soon he'll settle down .
he'll work out that i mean him no harm .
it's good that me and terri came along .
otherwise , the next car down the track would have slaughtered him .
they're quick and they'll eat other snakes .
there's not another snake they'd encounter that they wouldn't eat .
in fact , this big bloke here ... ... probably would have eaten other venomous snakes of his species .
they can actually be cannibalistic .
out of my eyes !
don't bite my boot !
right behind his head ... ... are two huge venom glands .
and he'd be able to belt in , like two hypodermic needles ... ... around about 300 milligrams of venom in one hit .
terri , where's the catching bag?
got it !
good one , mate .
go !
twist .
king brown !
that's one snake to release , and one croc to catch .
we got a couple of problems .
the beacon's transmitting the intermittent signal , so it's probably in the river .
and my partner doesn't want to get his gun wet .
it's on this property .
the river should be right down there .
so we run our cover , gain access and ... ... execute .
what about the dogs?
we'll take our chances .
we're set .
no one's around to get in the way .
you look beat .
trouble with the satellite investigation .
personnel or hardware?
possibly both .
do you need me to stay on in case anything comes in?
yeah , if you don't mind .
of course not .
i've got a state department reception with ansell .
if i don't show , it could send up a flare there's a problem .
the last thing we need is for anyone to think there's a leak in the boat .
we're looking for a big male croc .
probably around the 12 to 14 foot mark .
according to the ranger ... ... he's dominated this section of the river for quite some time .
all of the riverbank in this area is private property .
but to a big old croc , this is his territory .
it's a real shame when people come along and want him out .
finding him could take days , even weeks .
and he's probably watching us right now .
i'll have to go ashore and look for slides .
they're the marks on the banks that are left by crocodiles sunning themselves .
okay , ter , this looks promising .
keep your wits about you , mate .
i've been studying crocodile behavior all my life ... ... and i know exactly what signs to look for .
here we go .
this is it !
look at this classic slide .
big belly mark .
two feet .
look !
this makes him about that wide .
straight up here .
foot marks .
he came down through here .
there's the slide .
feet marks .
straight down in there .
and this is a recent slide .
with this evidence , the crocodile must be close .
real close .
here we go .
this is wet .
that means the crocodile has come up here just moments before i got here .
he's probably sitting out there , camouflaged .
terri , i got him !
bring the boat over here !
nuts !
come on , ter !
what are you doing?
he's coming .
move back !
reverse , mate !
i've never seen a croc this determined in my life !
sui , stay there .
if he comes over , i'll top jaw him .
he's at the back of the boat .
get ready with the oar .
this croc must have taken a hammering from the locals .
to be this aggressive , he must have been tormented something shocking !
my guess is he was shot at by poachers , maybe even trapped by them , then got away .
this bloke is one angry , naughty , aggressive crocodile ... ... and this is going to be one very dangerous capture .
crikey !
he's wild , all right .
come on then .
don't miss .
this is very , very dangerous .
one slip by steve , and this croc could have his hand .
this animal could even flip our small boat over with no trouble at all .
crikey , he's angry !
man , he's aggressive !
he's blowing bubbles .
he's very aggressive .
i think i've got him .
he's got enough strength to pull steve clean out of the boat .
no , he spat it .
hold your ground .
i thought i had him that time .
i've never tried to rope a crocodile in the middle of a river like this .
he's grumpy , and he's powerful !
he's coming in .
we can't keep doing this .
i nearly got him .
no , he nearly got us .
if he comes in the boat , it will be easier to rope him .
get ready to gun the boat .
if i get the rope on him , keep some weight on it .
come on .
come on , mate .
come on .
crikey !
go , babe , go !
go with him , but don't get in front of him .
can you believe this?
being towed by a 12 footer !
if we can stay with him long enough , he's bound to get tired .
that's it .
that's a good pace .
this bloke's got attitude .
i don't know whether i've got him , or he's got me .
suddenly , the rope went slack .
he's stopped .
probably run out of steam .
but i don't trust him .
lost him .
it's coming back .
get the boat over here !
that crocodile nearly got me , sui !
now she's gone slack .
it looks like he's thrown the top jaw rope .
babe , stay with him !
stay with him !
this bloke's going flat out like a lizard drinking !
we're in for the ride of our lives !
keep up with him , terri !
crikey !
this croc is never going to give up !
just stay with him , babe .
he's steamin '!
i've never seen a crocodile with so much determination and power .
and it seems he knows exactly where he's taking us .
straight up that small creek .
here we go .
watch it .
no wonder these modern day dinosaurs have survived ... ... over 60 million years .
they're just so cunning !
no !
crikey !
duck !
stay with him , babe !
get up !
i got him !
this croc's smart .
real smart .
but he's running out of water and steam .
he's shot up this creek to give us the flick .
go , babe , go !
he's cornered .
he's cornered !
take this rope .
okay , i got it .
take it .
he's backing me up !
go !
pull !
hurry up , ter .
what are you doing?
he's moving too much .
hang on to him !
he's tired , mate .
get his bottom jaw .
i need a stick .
now this side .
hang on to him .
i'm good , mate .
come on .
get it near my teeth .
i don't need the stick .
no , you don't .
now get it under the other top jaw rope .
i need to use my fingers , okay?
coming over the top .
okay , i got it .
go !
hang on !
come on , big boy .
let's go for that bank .
here we go again .
you okay?
he's breaking me neck !
flip the boat off me !
i'm losing him .
move your legs , sweetheart .
get off the boat .
move .
sui , up !
come on , big boy .
let's go back .
top jaw rope .
pull it that way .
i know .
sui , up .
get up .
good girl .
he'll react when i fire this up .
you all right?
yeah .
the only thing left to do now is to take this ... ... the apex predator , as far away from here as possible .
slip the blindfold up under my arm .
you all right?
yeah .
drive the boat .
ansell .
archer and wheeler are close to recovery .
i can get the beacon before they set foot in the water .
keep me in the loop .
this is where the last clear signal came from .
it must be in the water .
that would explain the transmission disruption .
wait , i'm getting a signal .
then it's in the water ... ... or someone already has it .
it's headed this way .
is that an outboard?
see anything?
you won't believe this .
give me that .
get reynolds .
the binoculars have picked up the discovery channel .
and you wanted to keep this a low key operation .
run !
did you hear that?
gunshots .
just ahead .
could only be poachers .
settle down , mate .
settle down .
no wonder this poor old crocodile is so aggressive .
we must get him out of this river system , or he won't survive .
we're going for the truck .
so i want you to jump on the croc with all your weight .
two , three , go !
hit it , mate .
you all right?
i got him .
call it if you come unglued .
okay .
poachers are the bane of my existence .
once we get this crocodile safe and sound ... ... i'm going to come back here and give them a steve o education .
crocodiles aren't evil , ugly monsters waiting to kill people .
no way !
they deserve respect and conservation .
trespassing is enough reason to be shot .
but having a go at my dogs?
well ....
now , that's a lynching crime .
ma'am , they were trying to rip us apart .
kinder than leaving the job to me .
we work for the government .
you those useless croc catchers sam flynn sent for?
that's us .
we're looking for crocs .
seen any recently?
let's take a little run up to the house .
call sam flynn .
see what he thinks about this .
why don't you and jo go?
we'll stay here and ... ... keep searching .
you , get in the bike .
my dogs will stay here and keep you two company .
this is why i constantly tell you to expect the unexpected .
yes , sir .
what have we got?
we've put together a brief overview of the suspects .
this background check indicates ... ... that they've been actively in the field on assignment since 1992 .
the areas they frequent are always remote and highly sensitive .
for example , in 1996 , '97 ... ... the irwins were in indonesia during the political unrest .
they were also traveling in various parts of south america in '97 ... ... and were present for two coups .
in '98 , they were in kenya when our embassy was targeted ... ... and in east timor in '99 , just after the civil war .
in '99 and 2000 , the irwins had full access ... ... to military personnel and property on u. s. air force bases ... ... in eglin , florida , and luke , arizona .
too many locations with highly sensitive situations ... ... for this to be coincidence .
and now our agents in northern australia ... ... have reported that the irwins beat them to the beacon ... ... which we believe is in their possession .
maybe they were just out filming and ... ... picked up this hardware by mistake .
no .
look at this .
in 2001 , the irwins announced that their zoo in australia was ... ... undergoing a $40 million expansion plan .
you don't make that kind of money on cable television .
in you go .
lid !
usually we relocate crocodiles back in the same river system ... ... but out of harm's way .
but this croc we're going to have to drive over the mountains ... ... to a completely new river system .
the poachers are going to persist until they get him .
and this croc is game .
real game .
two , three , up !
come forward .
that's it .
dad and i had learned that the only way to transport crocs successfully ... ... is to hold them in a wooden crate , where they can't hurt themselves or us .
and they arrive at their destination with minimal stress ... ... and ready for a quick release .
this croc has proven that he has no fear of man .
and that's dangerous for the croc .
real dangerous .
leave it !
look but don't touch .
do you mind if i wash up?
don't run the water too long .
we only got tanks out here .
sam flynn .
so you send three city slickers to do a job i could have done with one bullet !
the beacon's still moving .
they're getting further away .
one of us has to make a run for the car .
i used this on my last assignment with the arctic wolves .
did it work?
most of the time .
but it can exert the opposite motivation .
meaning?
they'll attack .
the two blokes look like they've never been out of an office .
the girl might chip a fingernail if she's not careful .
turn the damn water off !
hang on a second .
i think one of them's taking a bath .
water's worth more than gold out here !
what are you doing in there?
brozzie , you there?
brozzie?
mongrel !
the croc guy's moved a long way from the river .
we'll have to go like hell to catch him .
but they're moving slowly .
this road will get us right behind them .
once we're on them , it's gonna be a very sensitive situation .
i think it's time we got what we came for .
fair dinkum , we're always rescuing animals .
our truck's startin 'to fill up .
we got sui the dog , joey kangaroo , bird eating spider , king brown snake ... ... and a crocodile to release over the mountain at the thomson river .
we've got company .
they're in a hurry .
a real hurry .
with animals on board , we should pull over and let them pass .
yeah .
i don't want to stress the crocodile more than i have to .
he's been through enough for one day .
crikey !
these blokes are mad .
real mad !
with all that gunfire earlier , this must be the poachers !
steve , i don't think we should stop .
these blokes mean business !
they probably know we've got the croc on board and they want it .
crikey !
i've never seen poachers this persistent .
these blokes will stop at nothing .
here , quick , babe , take the wheel .
try not to hit any bumps .
be careful , steve .
remember , you've got a croc on board .
this bloke's trespassing on my territory .
haven't they got a cheek?
steady mate .
this bloke's off the richter scale !
crikey !
lucky my wife's such a good driver !
you've been upsetting my croc , mate !
they never know when to let go , do they?
isn't he gorgeous?
this is where your journey ends , mate .
danger .
see ya .
well ... ... that's one poacher that just learned a valuable steve o lesson .
don't muck with it !
okay , babe , i'm coming back in .
mongrel !
come back here with my plane , you wanker !
you okay?
thought you said there was nothing to worry about in australia .
lucky it's such a friendly country .
anything broken?
nothing retribution won't fix .
good .
let's go .
let's find my gun first .
one , two , three , pull !
pull !
hang onto him .
he's quieted down enough .
i'm going to the truck .
be quick .
you okay?
yup .
we managed to give the poachers the slip .
but i'll be much happier when we get this bloke into his new territory .
check this out !
croc poo .
this animal's been stressed .
real stressed !
those poachers have a lot to answer for .
what the heck is this?
no wonder the croc's been cranky !
look like some kind of metal object .
crocs can digest fur , feather , and bone , but not metal .
even a beer can will kill them !
looks like some kind of kid's top or something .
people need to be more careful when they discard their rubbish .
it's articles like this which is decimating our wildlife !
i'm gonna take this back and study it a bit later on .
ter , hang onto this for us !
i'd love to get my hands on the owner !
sui , in the boat .
no .
brozzie?
brozzie .
help !
i'm in the bathroom !
i'm in here , you idiot !
sugar .
no .
they're back on the river .
check their truck .
i'll get the boat .
motor's still warm !
they think they've given us the slip .
there's a baby kangaroo in here !
and some left over takeout food .
good shot .
i guess they know now they didn't give us the slip .
what's going on down there?
i'm at the thomson river .
i've been balled up by a gun wielding rancher and chased by wild dogs .
get rid of everything .
don't worry .
i won't leave any evidence .
sam , get that idiot brozzie drewitt out of there ... ... before she kills someone .
thanks .
i appreciate that .
good thing so many people hate you .
six neighbors called to complain about your dangerous flying .
i figure your plane's headed to the thomson river .
another thing to figure on , i'm billing you for the cost of my barn .
this will be the crocodile's new home .
we can't risk it any further .
by the sound of gunfire , they're right behind us !
safest place for this bloke is back in the drink .
just go forward .
sui , go for the bank .
sui can sense that it's safer on the riverbank .
she knows that any minute this crocodile ... ... could death roll or head shake and send us into the water .
we don't want to tip the boat over .
grab the top jaw ropes .
his eyes are uncovered .
watch he doesn't head bash you , he'll snap your legs .
just one loop round .
i'm going with the other one .
should i cover his eyes?
no , mate .
okay .
you ready?
i'm going in .
hey , big boy .
we're doing it .
sit there with your hands on his eyes .
that's great .
now comes the dangerous bit .
big boy , you're almost home .
you're almost there .
there he goes .
not yet .
keep the strain on .
this is dangerous for me and the crocodile .
if the croc gets away now ... ... his jaws are tied shut and he'd never survive .
and if i'm not fast enough when i cut the rope , i could lose a hand , or worse .
here , big boy .
you're free .
there he goes !
yes !
job done .
let's head for home .
steve , i think i hear a motor .
could be the poachers .
let's get sui and pretend we've still got the croc .
sui's worked with me all her life .
as long as she can see me , she'll wait for us .
she's been me best mate for 13 years ... ... helping me catch hundreds of crocodiles ... ... and dealing with countless poachers and wildlife perpetrators .
we shouldn't have any trouble giving these blokes the slip .
if we can fool them into thinking we've still got the croc ... ... we can lead them away from here on a wild goose chase .
it's those same two blokes !
hundreds of miles of river ... ... and they're on us again .
no croc would stand a chance against them .
ter , spin around , mate .
this look like i'm laying on a croc?
if we can lure them far enough away , our croc will stand a chance .
we've got a more powerful outboard .
they won't catch up .
have a go at this !
crikey !
hold her steady .
did you see that?
must be a poacher war !
and we're in the middle of it !
throwing that dynamite ... ... might kill our croc !
we can't have that !
let me at them .
this is getting very dangerous .
holy smokes !
these blokes are serious !
let's get out of here !
hang on !
another coat of paint and we'd be history .
he's coming back .
that's it .
i'm getting grumpy now .
ter , take over .
ter , let me take over !
brace yourself !
take a look at this .
sweating bullets !
we're out of here .
have a go at this .
if they stay in the water long enough , the hunters will become the hunted .
that's nature's way .
we've received a communiqu from australia .
it seems the mission was less than a success .
unfortunately we're going to have to call in the defense department .
i don't like to say this , but it doesn't look like she survived .
the police will have to drag the river .
waste of money .
she's probably out there , watching us .
or maybe a croc got her .
come on , brozzie , it's his territory .
leave him be .
settle down .
just habit .
i won't hurt him .
at least , not while she's still in the water anyway .
but i'll tell you one thing .
if she sets foot on land , well ... ... that's my dogs 'territory .
i suggested that one of the operatives be from my group .
we had no idea dirty laundry was involved until it was too late .
this is going to put our operations on the front page of every newspaper .
since you've kept an eye on everything , you won't need a briefing !
gentlemen , i think the question is where do we go from here?
reynolds has just thrown some good agents to the dogs .
the agency should invest in waterproofing .
the way things are going , i'm ready for you to shoot me .
no , you're not getting off that easy .
yeah?
nothing at this point is gonna faze me .
damn .
jo buckley .
tomorrow , all hell will break loose .
reynolds has called in the pentagon .
he's been appointed to lead the investigation .
what do you want me to do?
disappear .
and you?
i can take care of myself .
if not for that caped crusader in shorts ... ... i'd have the top job now .
they won't trace it back to me .
i'm too clever for reynolds .
mr. ansell , step out of the carl
you're under arrest .
wanker .
that guy in the khaki shorts?
that dude on the discovery channel?
send in the marines , the air force , the rangers .
just pick up that ball !
what a steamer !
to think something the size of this ... ... carelessly discarded by thoughtless people ... ... could cause so much potential damage to our innocent native wildlife .
please dispose of junk like this wisely .
okay , sui , get it !
animals everywhere need our help and protection to survive ... ... if they'll make it into the future .
this has been one heck of an adventure .
we tossed a couple gorgeous snakes ... ... rescued the most beautiful , gnarly old crocodile ... ... and we taught those pesky poachers a steve o lesson .
what more could a bloke ask for?
crikey !
my eye .
those army blokes seemed pretty upset about their metal ball .
they reckoned it was more valuable ....
son of a gun .
of all the gear they get to play with ....
and again .
you'd think the last thing ....
you'd think the last ....
those army blokes seemed upset about their metal ball .
they reckoned it was real valuable .
of all the gear they get to play with ... ... you'd think they wouldn't need a kid's top .
and that grumpy rancher ... ... has joined the fauna and fisheries department as a volunteer .
but she's still having trouble dealing with crocodiles .
and check this out .
the u. s. government gave us those two poachers ... ... to work at australia zoo for nothing !
i reckon after i give them a full steve o education ... ... we'll be able to return them to the wild where they belong .
and that crocodile's happy .
real happy .
he's got himself a couple of gorgeous looking sheilas .
well , we're back to our adventure .
see ya .
yes !
i think i got it !
did i get it?
tell me i got it !
fifty nine crikey , take one .
mark it .
mark it?
mark it and put it away .
and action .
i know how to do it .
crikey .
