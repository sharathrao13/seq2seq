i'm making a goose for my sister's wedding gift .

isn't it a blessing of fortune?
i have to do it for my sister .
on behalf of my deceased father .
on behalf of my working mother .
my sister was like both a father and mother to me .
when i think about my sister missing a year in high school to work for my tuition ,
i want to do everything for my sister .
i'm sorry .

the wedding is still far away .
i just thought it'd be hard on you .
yeah , i know how you feel .
it wouldn't be because you're embarrassed of me , right?
since it's not , then of course i should go .
young ju , i think you've misunderstood .
what can be misunderstood between us?

that i was in the u. s. , japan , and on my way from southeast asia .

i'm a pharmacist .
pharmacist chol hee chul .
in yongkang , i'm well trusted , and i have many customers .
i know we won't meet again , but i feel bad having to leave that type of memory with someone .
i'm not that low of a person .
this ring is my mother's .
i'm on my way to propose to someone .
this very important ring mistakenly fell down ...
over there ...
my nose is bleeding .
watch where you're going?

no way that idiot ...
he won't pin it on me , will he?

we'll contact you if he calls , so you should go home for now .
yongkang station
how will i ever find him here?
chol hee chul?
hee chul?
hee chul?
you know him?
isn't that the hee chul at yongkang pharmacy?
yeah , that's him .
you mean the mayor's son .
if it's the mayor's son , then isn't he your son's friend?
of course he's friends with my young deuk .
hee chul was the top student , young deuk was the top bully?
there you go again with your crap !
did i say something wrong?
your son ripped hee chul's forehead and his grandma went nuts .
that's right , hee chul's grandma adored him .
sons are precious in that family .
his mother wanted to have a son , so she borrowed my panties for luck .
are you serious?
don't you remember?
excuse me .
all they have is one child?
no .
they have a daughter , too .
his mother had her and passed away .
yeah , right after i had my man suk .
it's been twenty years already !
yeah , now i remember .
hee chul's grandma was hoping for another son .
but after his weak mother died , the town scolded the grandma .
the town didn't know anything .
yeah , she was so good to hee chul's mom .
that's right .
ladies?
anyway , how do you all know so much?
this town is so small , we can count all the spoons , right?
so what about hee chul?
yes?
i didn't see hee chul at the drug store just now .
why don't you go directly to the mayor's home instead?
i've been a taxi driver in this town for ten years .
but i've never seen a pretty girl like you .
you could be an actress .
nice skin , pretty legs .
all kinds of people are pissing me off today .
so where can i take you , princess?
to the mayor's home .
why are you going to the mayor's home?
i'm gonna be his new daughter in law .
wait just one moment .
what can i do for you?
i came to find chol hee chul .
hee chul?
you're too late .
hee chul died a year ago .
today's his memorial .
is this some horror flick?
excuse me .
you said you came for hee chul?
actually , what happened with this ring ...
hee chul isn't here right now .
but hee chul's father is at the drug store now .
i'm hee chul's aunt .
what can i do for you?
mother , i'm your third son in law .
goodness , you're too late .
my third son in law died last year .
oh , mother .
we have a guest .
she's a bit senile .
honey , hurry and take her to the drug store .
so you're dating my son , hee chul?
pardon?
well , it's not what it seems .
go on with your business .
hey !
if it's not what it seems , then why do you have this ring?
it's a bit complicated to explain .
just think of it as a ring i picked up ,
so please call ...
picked up?
this ring?
i think you've misunderstood .
actually , i'm not in a position to tell you exactly what happened .
aren't you going home?
darn door handle .
oh , i see you have a guest .
miss .
you appear out of the blue .
you bring this wedding ring , and you talk about my son .
shouldn't you explain exactly , so that i can fully understand?
you're right , but ...
what happened , you see ...
well , to tell you the truth ,
i didn't meet your son on good terms .
it's partially my fault ,
but he made a mistake to ...
mistake?
no , i mean , to put it simply ,
i just wanna return this ring .
i couldn't reach him , so i came all the way here .
wait , it sounds as if our hee chul did something wrong to you .
why?
pardon?
from what you said , my son is making some big mistake .
isn't that what you're implying?
no , that's not what i mean .
looks like a new face to me .
who the heck is this girl?
how did you meet my boy?
who are you , miss?
you're all so mean .
don't ask me anything anymore .
how are you?
i'm so glad to meet you .
i've heard a lot about you from hee chul .
what's wrong with her?
officer kim !
bring the stretcher !
yes , sir .
why isn't the door opening?
the door usually opens from the outside in a police car .
open the door !
so hee chul said she's his girlfriend?
i don't know exactly .
come on and tell me .
then whose girl would it be?
his dad's?
happy birthday to you !
happy birthday to you !
happy birthday , dear jae eun !
happy birthday to you !
happy birthday , jae eun .
i don't know everything .
just that he mentioned her a few times not long ago .
what makes you sure it's her?
mom's ring .
actually , hee chul had it for a long time .
you know how corny he can be .
he was going to propose with it .
you must be so happy .
you always said you wanted a daughter in law .
go see how she is .
i should've just finished my time .
marriage fraud on parole?
it's getting worse by the minute .
i'm looking after the patient that just left .
i swear she said that she'll be his daughter in law .
really?
i'm serious .
anyway , why did she faint?
wait a minute !
at three months , it's important to be careful .
to avoid a miscarriage , meals must be eaten regularly .
what did you say?
oh goodness , then it all fits .
in other words , hee chul did that to that girl .
then she became that way , and ...
you're right .
so hee chul made a mistake first .
and she said it was partially her fault .
but regardless , that rotten hee chul ...
for you ,
i lack readiness .
for you , i lack appearance .
for you ,
i lack courage .
for you , i lack life .
i ...
but i pray i can be only for you .
with this ring ...
our family is a bit peculiar .
whenever something comes up , we all rush in like that , and take the wind out of people .
yeah , they seem a bit different .
but other families are very envious of us .
you know , city people aren't like that .
i guess you're right .
yes?
i bet you're very uncomfortable .
i'm okay .
i'm sorry about today .
since you came to see hee chul anyway , feel at home and we'll talk when he comes back .
now .
get some rest .
yes , good night , father .
father?
father?
a bastard like me shouldn't be alive , right?
someone who plans to propose
loses the ring .
that's me .
why me?
anyway , do you think jae eun's mad?
her face looked pissed off .
no way .
she left smiling .
actually , it was fun .
isn't it yours?
you got a call .
where?
who the hell's calling?
hello?
yes , sir .
yes , hello .
one moment .
hey , it's your dad .
it's me , father .
where are you now?
i'm still in busan .
you have a girlfriend?
how did you know that?
when will you be back?
well , i still have some things to do .
you're hiding out , aren't you?
sir?
i'll keep this short !
come back tomorrow !
yes , sir ...
hiding out?
what are you talking about?
we have to hold her here no matter what .
what if she goes and have an abortion?
then we've committed a sin .
no , i won't see it .
like he said , we must hold her here by all means .
hurry outside .
go home and get some rest .
you did great today .
boy , i'm exhausted .
what a day , huh?
she's pretty , huh?
very pretty .
why do i feel so worn out?
over that?
it all worked out anyway .
he can marry hee chul off and have grandkids .
it certainly is a blessing .
i wish mother can hug a great grandchild soon .
want another kid?
be quiet .
hurry and hop in .
okay .
long , long , time ago , there lived sun boy and moon girl .
but a tiger tried to eat them .
as sun boy and moon girl tried to run away , a rope suddenly fell from the sky .
sun boy and moon girl went up on the rope .
damn it , this is a long story .
the tiger fell and died .
so what happened next?
sis !
yes?
it's soo mi .
yes , one sec '.
what's wrong with your voice?
are you in pain?
no !
oh , what a hot night .
i thought you'd be here longer .
going back for the ring?
no , my father told me to hurry and come back .
you're so sweet .
i'm not sweet .
i'm stupid .
anyway ...
have you thought about it?
about coming down to yongkang .
you're talking about yongkang again?
your proposal didn't mean that we were going to apply for seoul hospital together?
of course , it does .
just that there's nice weather , the scenery's nice , and ...
it'll freshen up your head a bit .
i'll go .
where?
yongkang .
i'll go as soon as possible .
hey , what's with you?
since you answered so easily , it sounds like a lie .
the mayor is so lucky .
fate brought her here .
he longed for a daughter in law .
fate works in wonders .
you're right .
he likes her more because she's pretty .
help yourself to plenty .
thank you very much , father .
goodness , she said father .
yes .
thank you , father .
say your welcome to your daughter in law .
are you all having a party?
you don't even know the whole story .
then ...
i heard you wanted to go to a spa .
yes?
i just mentioned that you wanted a bath .
there's a famous spa here .
no , i didn't really mean it .
usually , you're supposed to go with the in laws .
that way you'll get close faster .
yes , hee chul will take a while , so let's go to the spa .
but i don't feel so well .
yeah , it is far though .
it'll only take 15 minutes by car .
a new spa opened by the bus terminal .
who goes to the spa with in laws lately?
it was only during our time .
i'll go to the spa !
i want to take grandmother and go with the family .
wonderful !
be careful !
please watch your step !
you should've held her !
stop overreacting .
let's go in .
does hee chul know what state your body's in?
no , not yet .
why didn't you tell him?
that's how you seize his heart .
i see .
where's the restroom?
want me to go with you?
i'll just go on my ...
no , you must be extra careful at this time .
soo mi !
go with her to the restroom .
okay .
no , i'll just change here .
so why did they go to the spa all of a sudden?
hee chul .
yes?
i'm very disappointed in you .
what?
i'm telling you this now that you've grown up .
before i married your aunt , i had many women all over me .
but do you know why i married your aunt?
no .
she was carrying a baby like you are now , you fool .
auntie is carrying my baby?
welcome !
attention customers !
looking for mister chol hee chul's fiancee .
mister chol hee chul's fiancee . please come to the reception desk . she's impersonating as my fiancee ,
i tell you i'm on the air , damn it !
what's this noise?
i don't know .
where did she go?
that woman ...
welcome !
you !
it's you from the train , right?
i've finally found you .
but what are you doing here?
it's all because of that darn ring .
i don't have time to ...
ring?
how did you ...
wait , then you're the one
who's swindling as my fiancee .
swindling?
don't screw with me , and just give me my bag .
now i see that you stole my ring .
your ring is with your father .
just tell me where my ...
know what happened to me because of you?
why'd you steal my ring?
are you done talking?
no !
what did i do to you to deserve this?
now i see that you hitting me was all an act .
i see you're a real pro !
a pro !
i warned you , didn't?
do you know you're screwing with me?
i screwed with you , so what?
is screwing with you that important now?
after what happened to me ,
does it matter that i screw ...
you rotten bastard !
are you that proud of screwing a girl?
is that what i taught you?
i swear i don't know her .
father , i'm your son !
you've raised me for over twenty years .
don't you trust me?
then why is she doing this?
that's what i want to know , too .
hey you !
why the hell are you doing this?
how can she talk if you bully her like that?
don't you know she's expecting?
this is driving me nuts .
uncle .
shouldn't you sense that something's wrong?
well , you could have a point .
well , but it does seem like there's some reason we don't know .
everything is all my fault .
if i hadn't showed up ,
i wouldn't have caused any trouble .
yes .
like hee chul said ,
i've lied .
see?
i told you so .
i told you so .
frankly , i'm not the girl from hee chul's pharmaceutical school .
but my love for hee chul was true .
actually , i didn't go to college .
even when i heard that hee chul was seeing his classmate ,
i couldn't say anything , knowing i couldn't compete .
i prayed that he'd come back , but he cut me off entirely .
rotten bastard .
uncle .
i'm very sorry .
i just wanted to return the ring , and not mention these things .
although it was brief , you all were so good to me .
i'm sorry to disappoint you .
sit back down .
it's okay , father .
father?
sit down .
yes , sir .
i'm not saying this because i don't trust you .
i'm just asking this because i need to know for sure .
can you tell us whatever you know about hee chul?
yeah !
great idea , father !
how about this instead?
ask for her ld number and find out who she really is !
what do you think , uncle?
are we interrogating a criminal?
are we?
idiot !
hee chul , do i have to do this?
be frank and say that you don't know .
how would you know when we only met once on the train?
hee chul always said this like a habit .
that he's a precious son .
when did i say that?
since there was only one son for every generation ,
hee chul's mother went through so much trying to bear hee chul .
hee chul's mother did everything possible .
she even borrowed panties from a woman who bore many sons .
he said that his mother went through so much to bear him .
his grandmother was so good to his mother .
after she passed away bearing soo mi ,
hee chul's grandmother was very misunderstood .
poor girl !
poor girl ...
grandma , please stop crying .
this is impossible !
father !
aunt ...
soo mi , you told her , didn't you?
this is fishy .
she has to talk about me !
say something about me , okay?
hee chul was a good student .
to be frank , hee chul brags too much .
sometimes i think he's poking fun at me .
uncle !
one time he bragged so much he got into a fight .
his name was young ... something .
young deuk .
that's right .
i don't need to see it to know .
he probably got hit after bragging about his grades .
that gave him the scar on his forehead .
that's why his grandmother went into a frenzy .
you still call her a fraud after that?
how did you know that?
you rotten bastard !
punish me instead , father !
hee chul keeps insisting on an abortion .
but i can't do it alone .
i'm sorry , father !
what?
you rotten bastard !
i told you not to screw with me , didn't i?
how did you first meet hee chul?
well ...
was it a sunny day?
or a rainy day?
it did seem to have snowed .
anyway , i was drinking tea .
i think hee chul was using the phone .
oh my !
i don't care about a measly wallet .
thanks to you , i've gained a precious encounter .
i run a drug store in yongkang .
a pharmacist .
i'm chol hee chul .
how slimy .
that's really how you met him?
think slimy was all?
i learned a lesson then .
don't ever jump into someone else's business .
love is so strange , considering what can be overcome .
don't you think?
so what work do you do now?
i'm taking a rest .
then what did you do before?
i was just ...
i worked for a certain government organization .
so you've come on your own feet .
now i don't have to climb in through the window .
didn't you hear my father say not to even step into the house?
why is my father your father?
who says so?
from what i know , he's not your father after today .
it's just the two of us , so why don't we be frank .
what do you want?
my bag .
your bag?
because i'm in a certain bind , i can't either stay or go .
it's a real drag to be here , you know?
you remember my bag , right?
what would i know about your bag?
did you leave it with me?
how could you say that?
i went to retrieve your ring , but i'm paying for it now .
so shouldn't you try to remember at least?
oh yeah , the ring .
i don't know how precious that crappy bag was , that ring was on that day?
that crappy bag?
yeah !
that crappy bag with the ragged handle .
all i need to do is buy you a new bag .
but how will you make up for what's happened to me?
so you don't know where it is?
you don't even know what was inside it .
that crappy bag?
fine .
i'll wait here until you find it .
i don't have any place to go anyway .
how dare you?
are you threatening me?
oh boy , i can't wait to see what happens !
you have no sense at all !
you beast !
how could you hit a woman?
you're a beast !
die , you beast !
i'm hungry .
stay for a long , long time , okay?
yes , grandma .
hello !
going to work?
yes .
are you preparing well for the contest?
of course .
no matter what , you have to win for the town , okay?
yes , don't worry .
have a nice day !
hi , on your way somewhere?
i played a lot when i was young , but i never abandoned my wife !
not a single man did well after abandoning his wife !
for your father at least , if you keep acting up ...
that hurt !
cover your stomach when you go to bed .
be a nice boy .
promise me .
lightning will strike you down .
right mom?
make a woman cry , and lighting will strike you down .
you were right .
she's really pretty .
i'm so envious .
the books are too old .
they have nothing to look at , so they just play .
last time i estimated , we need 4 million won to fill it up with books .
why do i have to come into my own room like this?
hey !
wouldn't someone take this wrong?
why the hell are you doing this to me?
find my bag fast .
i don't have much time either .
why do you think that bag ...
mother !
mother , where are you?
mother , are you upstairs?
mother !
