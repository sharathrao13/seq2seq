'whenever i get gloomy with the state of the world ,
'i think about the arrivals gate at heathrow airport .
'general opinion makes out that we live in a world of hatred and greed
'but i don't see that .
'seems to me that love is everywhere .
'often it's not particularly dignified or newsworthy but it's always there .
'fathers and sons , mothers and daughters , husbands and wives ,
'boyfriends , girlfriends , old friends .
'when the planes hit the twin towers ,
'none of the phone calls from people on board were messages of hate or revenge ,
'they were all messages of love .
'lf you look for it , i've got a sneaky feeling you'll find that love actually is all around . '
i feel it in my fingers
i feel it in my toes
feel it in my toes , yeah
love is all around me and so the ...
i'm afraid you did it again , bill .

karen , it's me again .
i'm sorry , i literally don't have anybody else to talk to .

horrible moment , though .

of course .

understood .
er , bugger off , call me later .
so what's this big news?
we've been given our parts in the nativity play and i'm the lobster .
the lobster?
yeah .

yeah .
first lobster .
there was more than one lobster present at the birth of jesus?
duh .
best sandwiches in britain .

beautiful muffin for a beautiful lady .
morning , my future wife .
ok , you can stop there .
thanks .
i need a couple of orange gels .
by the way , he introduced me as john but everyone calls me jack .
oh , fine .
nice to meet you , jack .
he got me right , though .
i'm just judy .
great , just judy ! .
no surprises?
no surprises .
not like the stag night?
unlike the stag night .
you admit the prostitutes were a mistake?
i do .
and it would've been much better if they'd not turned out to be men?
that is true .
good luck , kiddo .
prime minister , over here ! .
thank you .
welcome , prime minister .
woh !
i must work on my wave .
how are you?
how are you feeling?
erm ...
cool .
powerful .
would you like to meet your household staff?
yes , i would like that very much indeed .
anything to put off actually running the country .
this is terence .
he's in charge .
morning , sir .
good morning .
i had an uncle called terence .
hated him , i think he was a pervert .
but i very much like the look of you .
this is pat .
hello , pat .
good morning , sir .
i'm the housekeeper .
oh , right .
i should be easier than the last lot .
no nappies , no teenagers , no scary wife .
and this is natalie .
she's new , like you .
hello , natalie .
hello , david .
i mean , sir .
shit , i can't believe i've just said that .
and now i've gone and said " shit " .
twice .
i'm so sorry , sir .
you could've said " fuck " and we'd have been in real trouble .
thank you , sir .
i had a premonition i was gonna fuck up on my first day .
oh , piss it !
right , i'll get my things and then let's fix the country , shall we?
yeah , i can't see why not .
it's all right .
did you see what i did?
yes , i did .
i just went " blurh " .
hello there .
i'm right over here .
yeah , i'm in here .
ok .
good .
thank you .
ah .
oh , no .
that is so inconvenient .
in the presence of god , peter and juliet have given their consent and made their marriage vows to each other .
they've declared their marriage by the giving of rings .
i therefore proclaim that they are husband and wife .
and you resisted the temptation for surprises .
yeah , i'm mature now .
love , love , love
love , love , love
love , love , love ...
did you do this?
er , no .
love , love , love , love
there's nothing you can do that can't be done
oh , it ...
there's nothing you can sing that can't be sung
there's nothing you can say but you can learn how to play the game
it's easy
all you need is love
all you need is love
all you need is love , love
love is all you need ...
look , it's pikey .
hello !
what the hell are you doing here?
oh , i just popped over to borrow some old cds .
the lady of the house let you in , did she?
yeah .
lovely , obliging girl .
yeah .
i thought i'd pop back and see if she's better .
this is good .
oh .
listen , erm , i've been thinking .
i think we ought to take mum out for her birthday on friday .
what do you think?
i just feel we've been bad sons this year .
sounds fine .
a bit boring but fine .
hurry up , big boy !
i'm naked and i want you at least twice before jamie gets home .
i am so happy to see you !
delicious delicacy?
er , no , thanks .
taste explosion?
food?
no , thanks .
yeah , a bit dodgy , isn't it?
looks like a dead baby's finger .
oooh .
oh .
tastes like it , too .
i'm colin , by the way .
i'm nancy .
wicked .
what do you do , nancy?
i'm a cook .
ever do weddings?
yes , i do .
they should've asked you to do this one .
they did .
god , i wish you hadn't have turned it down .
i didn't .
right .
i've worked out why i can't find true love .
why is that?
english girls .
they're stuck up , you see .
and i am primarily attractive to girls who are cooler , game for a laugh .
like american girls .
so i should just go to america !
i'd get a girlfriend there instantly .
what do you think?
i think it's crap , colin .
that's where you're wrong .
american girls would dig me with my cute british accent .
you don't have a cute british accent .
yes , i do !
i'm going to america .
colin , you're a lonely , ugly arsehole .
accept it .
never .
i am colin , god of sex .
i'm just on the wrong continent , that's all .
bit of quiet while we finish the lighting , guys !
the traffic today was just ...
unbelievable .
judy , could you take the top off this time?
lighting need to know when we're gonna see the , erm , nipples and when we're not .
yes , ok .
right .
at least it's nice and warm in here .
not always the case , is it?
i was standing in for brad pitt once on seven years in tibet ...
yes , yeah .
bloody freezing ...
guys , time's tight and we have to get the actors in .
fine .
i promise i won't look .
right , let's have another look at that , please .
can you just put your hands on her breasts?
ok , yeah .
is that all right?
yes .
i'll warm them up !
and massage them , please .
right .
it's junction 13 that's just murder , isn't it?
total gridlock this morning .
jo and i had a lot of time to prepare for this moment .
some of her requests , for instance , that i should bring claudia schiffer as my date to the funeral ,
i was confident she expected me to ignore .
but others she was pretty damn clear about .
when she first mentioned what's about to happen ,
i said , " over my dead body .
and she said , " no , daniel , over mine .
and as usual , my darling girl ... and sam's darling mum was right .
so she's going to say her final farewell to you not through me but , inevitably , ever so coolly , through the immortal genius of the bay city rollers .
bye bye baby , baby goodbye
goodbye baby , baby bye bye
bye bye baby
don't make me cry goodbye baby , baby bye bye
you're the one girl in town i'd marry
girl i'd marry you now if i were free
i wish it could be
i could love you but why begin it?
cos there ain't any future in it
she's got me but i'm not free so ... bye bye baby , baby goodbye
goodbye baby , baby bye bye
bye bye baby , don't make me cry
goodbye baby , baby bye bye
wish i never had known you ...
do you love him?
er , er , what?
no , l i just thought i'd ask bluntly in case it was the right question and you needed someone to talk to about it and no one had ever asked you .
no .
no .
no is the answer .
absolutely not . .. on my finger ...
so that's a no , then?
yes .
erm ...
bye bye baby , baby goodbye
goodbye baby , baby bye bye ...
this dj , what do you reckon?
the worst in history?
probably .
i think it all hangs on the next song .
now here's one for the lovers .
that's quite a few of you , i shouldn't be surprised and a half .
puppy love )
and they called it ...
he's done it , it's official .
worst dj in the world .
oh , i guess they'll never know ...
sarah's waiting for you .
oh , yes , of course , erm ...
great , er , good , good .
how are you doing , mia?
settling in fine?
learning who to avoid?
absolutely .
harry?
sarah , switch off your phone and tell me exactly how long it is that you've been working here .
two years , seven months , three days and , i suppose , what , two hours?
and how long have you been in love with karl , our enigmatic chief designer?
um ...
two years , seven months , three days and , i suppose , an hour and 30 minutes .
thought as much .
do you think everybody knows?
yes .
do you think karl knows?
yes .
oh , that is ... that is bad news .
i just thought that maybe the time had come to do something about it .
like what?
lnvite him out for a drink then casually mention you'd like to marry him and have lots of sex and babies .
you know that?
yes .
and so does karl .
think about it , for all our sakes .
it's christmas .
certainly .
excellent .
will do .
thanks , boss .
hi , sarah .
hi , karl .
christmas is all around )
babe .
absolutely , fire away .
mia , mia , would you turn that down?
what is that?
that was the christmas effort from the once great billy mack .
oh , dear me , how are the mighty fallen .
i can safely say that is the worst record i've heard this century ...
oh , and coincidentally , i believe billy will be a guest on my friend mike's show in a few minutes 'time .
welcome back , bill .
billy , welcome back to the airwaves .
new christmas single , cover of love is all around .
except we've changed the word " love " to " christmas " .
yes , is that an important message to you , bill?
not really , mike .
christmas is a time for people with someone they love in their lives .
and that's not you?
that's not me , michael .
when i was young and successful , i was greedy and foolish and now i'm left with no one , wrinkled and alone .
wow .
thanks for that , bill .
for what?
for actually giving a real answer to a question .
it doesn't often happen here at radio watford , i can tell you .
ask me anything , i'll tell you the truth .
best shag you ever had?
britney spears .
wow .
no , only kidding !
she was rubbish .
ok , here's one .
how do you think the new record compares to your old , classic stuff?
come on , mikey , you know as well as i do the record's crap .
but wouldn't it be great if number one this christmas wasn't some smug teenager but an old ex heroin addict searching for a comeback at any price?
those young popsters come christmas will be stretched out naked with a cute bird balancing on their balls and i'll be stuck in some dingy flat with me manager joe , ugliest man in the world , fucking miserable because our fucking gamble didn't pay off .
so if you believe in father christmas , children , like your uncle billy does , buy my festering turd of a record .
and particularly enjoy the incredible crassness of the moment we try to squeeze an extra syilable into the fourth line .
i think you're referring to
lf you really love christmas ...
come on and let it snow . " ouch .
so , here it is one more time , the dark horse for this year's christmas number one ,
christmas is all around .
thank you , billy .
after this , the news .
is the new prime minister in trouble already?
i feel it in my fingers i feel it in my toes
ok .
what's next?
the president's visit .
ah , yes , yes .
i fear this is going to be a difficult one to play .
alex .
there's a strong feeling in the party we mustn't allow ourselves to be bullied
like the last government .
here , here .
this is our first really important test , let's take a stand .
right .
right .
i understand that but i have decided ... not to .
not this time .
let's not forget that america is the most powerful country in the world .
i'm not going to act like a petulant child .
who do you have to screw round here to get a cup of tea and a biscuit?
right .
yeah , come in .
these are from the treasury ...
uh huh . .. and these are for you .
excellent .
thanks a lot .
i was hoping you'd win , not that i wouldn't have been nice to the other bloke , just always given him the boring biscuits with no chocolate .
thanks very much .
thanks ...
natalie .
god , come on , get a grip .
you're the prime minister , for god's sake .
so what do you reckon to our new prime minister?
oh , i like him .
i can't understand why he's not married , though .
you know the type , he's married to his job .
either that or gay as a picnic basket .
excuse me , judy , if you could just lower the nipples
and cheat them a bit to the left?
ok .
i have to say , judy , this is a real pleasure , it's lovely to find someone i can actually chat to .
thank you !
oh , well , you know .
and ditto .
thank you .
the move again , please , judy .
ooh , sorry .
oh , god , sorry .
you all right?
exciting news !
what?
i've bought a ticket to the states .
i'm off in three weeks .
no .
yes !
to a fantastic place called wisconsin .
no !
yes !
wisconsin babes , here comes sir colin !
no , col !
there are a few babes in america , i grant you , but they're going out with rich , attractive guys .
tone , you're just jealous .
you know perfectly well that any bar anywhere in america contains ten girls more beautiful and more likely to have sex with me
than the whole of the united kingdom .
that is total bollocks .
you're mad .
no , i'm wise .
stateside i am prince william without the weird family .
no , colin , no !
yes !
nyet !
da !
nein !
ja , darling !
right , the christmas party , not my favourite night of the year and your unhappy job to organise .
tell me .
it's basic , really .
find a venue , over order on the drinks , bulk buy the guacamole and advise the girls to avoid kevin if they want their breasts unfondled .
wives and family and stuff?
yeah .
i mean , not children .
but their wives and girlfriends , et cetera .
oh , christ , you haven't got some horrible six foot , tight t shirt wearing boyfriend?
no .
i'll just be hanging around the mistletoe , hoping to be kissed .
really?
right .
he now spends all the time in his room .
i mean , he'll be up there now .
that's not unusual .
my horrid son ...
bernard?
bernard .
stays in his room all the time .
thank goodness .
yeah , but karen , this is all the time .
i'm afraid that there's something really wrong , you know?
i mean , clearly it's about his mum but christ , he might be injecting heroin into his eyeballs for all i know .
at the age of 1 1?
well , maybe not his eyeballs , then .
maybe just his veins .
the problem is his mum always used to talk to him , you know , and ...
i don't know , this whole stepfather thing seems suddenly to somehow matter
iike it never did before .
listen , it was always going to be a totally shit time .
just be patient .
and maybe check the room for needles .
and then when he sometimes does come out , it's obvious he's been crying .
it's just such a ridiculous waste .
and now if it's going to ruin sam's life as well ...
i just don't know .
get a grip .
people hate sissies .
no one's ever gonna shag you if you cry all the time .
yeah .
absolutely .
helpful .
so , what's the problem , samuel?
is it just mum or is it something else , huh?
maybe school?
are you being bullied?
or is it something worse?
can you give me any clues at all?
you really want to know?
i really want to know .
even though you won't be able to help?
even if that's the case , yeah .
ok .
well ... truth is , actually ...
i'm in love .
sorry?
i know i should be thinking about mum and i am but i'm in love .
i was before she died and there's nothing i can do about it .
aren't you a bit young to be in love?
no .
ah , well .
ok , well ...
i'm a little relieved .
why?
because i ... thought it'd be something worse .
worse than the total agony of being in love?
er ...
no , you're right .
total agony .
night , sarah .
night , karl .
yeah , absolutely .
free as a bird .
fire away .
alone again .
naturally .
i'll deal with it .
mm .
ah .
natalie .
sir .
thanks .
natalie .
erm , i'm starting to feel ... uncomfortable about us working so closely every day and me knowing so little about you , it seems elitist and wrong .
well , there's not much to know .
well , erm , where do you live , for instance?
wandsworth .
the dodgy end .
ah , my sister lives in wandsworth .
oh .
so which exactly is the dodgy end?
at the end of the high street , harris street , near the queen's head .
oh , yeah , yeah , that is dodgy .
hm .
erm , and you live with your husband?
boyfriend?
three illegitimate but charming children?
no .
i've just split up with my boyfriend , so i'm back with my mum and dad for a while .
ah .
sorry .
no , it's fine .
i'm well shot of him .
he said i was getting fat .
i beg your pardon?
he said no one'd fancy a girl with thighs the size of tree trunks .
not a nice guy , actually , in the end .
no .
you know , erm ... being prime minister , i could just have him murdered .
thank you , sir .
i'll think about it .
do .
the sas are absolutely charming .
ruthless , trained killers are just a phone call away .
oh , god .
did you have this kind of problem?
yeah , course you did , you saucy minx .
so , let's go .
we can definitely crack this .
remember , i was a kid once , too .
so , come on , it's someone at school .
right?
yeah .
uh huh .
good , good .
and what does she , he , feel about you?
she doesn't even know my name .
and even if she did , she'd despise me .
she's the coolest girl in school .
and everyone worships her because she's heaven .
good .
good .
well , basically you're fucked , aren't you?
hi there and welcome back .
so , three weeks till christmas , looks like the real competition is gonna be blue .
i saw them on the show last week .
they weren't very nice about my record .
no .
little scamps .
but very , very talented musicians .
yeah .
i understand you've got a prize for our competition winners .
yes , i have , ant or dec .
it's a personalised felt tip pen .
oh , great .
it's brilliant .
it even writes on glass , so if you've got a framed picture , like , for instance , this one of blue , you can just write on it .
er , a lot of kids watching , billy .
oh , yeah .
hiya , kids .
here's an important message from your uncle bill don't buy drugs .
become a pop star and they give you them for free .
and i do believe it's a commercial break .
we'll see you soon .
bye bye .
all i want for christmas is you
look at him !
eurh !
just a minute .
actually , they're not funny .
they're art .
ok , let's say , er , thursday , my place .
great .
i've got juliet on the other line , she wants to ask you a favour .
ok , fine .
thanks and , er , be nice .
i'm always nice .
'you know what i mean , marky , be friendly . '
i'm always ...
'mark? '
hi .
how was the honeymoon?
it was great .
thanks for the gorgeous sendoff .
so , what can i do for you?
'it's only a tiny favour . '
i've just tried the wedding video and it's a disaster .
'it's come out all blue and wibbly . '
i'm sorry .
i remember you filming a lot and i wondered if i could look at it .
to be honest , i didn't really ...
please .
all i want is one shot of me in a wedding dress that isn't turquoise .
i'll have a look but i'm pretty sure i wiped it , so don't get any hopes up .
'must go . '
any progress with our matchmaking plans?
no .
i've done fuck all and never will because he's too good for me .
how true .
stop .
and of course , your mobile goes .
hello .
hi .
how you doing?
so , how's the christmas party going?
good .
think i've found a venue .
what's it like?
good .
good .
it's an art gallery .
full of dark corners for doing dark deeds .
oh .
right .
good .
well , i suppose i should take a look at it or something .
you should .
ah , bonjour , eleonore .
bonjour , monsieur bennett .
welcome back .
and this year you bring a lady guest?
no .
there's a change of situation .
just me .
oh .
am i sad or not sad?
i think you're not surprised .
and you stay here till christmas?
yeah , yeah .
good .
well , i find you a perfect lady to clean the house .
this is aurelia .
ah .
er , bonjour , aurelia .
bonjour .
er , je suis , er , trs heureux de vous avoir ici .
unfortunately , she cannot speak french , just like you .
she's portuguese .
ah , ah , buongiorno .
eusebio , er , er ... er , molto bueno ...
i think she's ten years too young to remember a footballer called eusebio .
and " molto bueno " is spanish .
right .
anyway , it's nice to meet you and ...
can you drive her home after her work?
oh , absolutely , yes .
con con grande , er , pl plesura .
which is what?
turkish?
bello .
er , bella .
er , mon montagno , arvarez ...
no , right .
silence is golden .
as the tremeloes said .
clever guys , although i think the original version was by frankie valli and the four seasons .
gr great band .
silence is golden )
oh , shut up .
mr president !
over here , sir !
what will you be talking about?
mr president , welcome .
it's a pleasure to meet you .
come through .
i'm sorry your wife couldn't make it .
so is she .
although she would have been kind of lonely .
yes .
pathetic , isn't it?
just never been able to tie a girl down .
not sure that politics and dating go together .
really?
i've never found that .
yeah , you're still sickeningly handsome , whereas i look like my aunt mildred .
very jealous of your plane , by the way .
thank you .
we love that thing .
ah , natalie .
hi .
morning , ma'am .
how's your day so far?
excellent .
my goodness , that's a pretty little son of a bitch .
did you see those pipes?
yeah , she's terrific .
at her job .
no , absolutely not .
we cannot and will not consult on that either .
that is unexpected .
well , it shouldn't be .
the last administration made it perfectly clear .
we're being consistent with their policies .
with all respect , they were bad policies .
thanks , alex .
i don't think we're making progress here .
let's , erm ... move on , shall we?
well , now , that was an interesting day .
sorry if our line was firm but there's no point in tiptoeing around today , then just disappointing you for four years .
i have plans and i plan to see them through .
absolutely .
there is one final thing to look at .
it's very close to my heart .
just give me a second .
i'll give you anything you ask for .
as long as it's not something i don't wanna give .
hi .
pathetic .
it's great scotch .
i'll , erm ...
i'll be going , then .
er , natalie ,
i hope to see much more of you as our countries work toward a better future .
thank you , sir .
er , yes , peter .
mr president , has it been a good visit?
very satisfactory indeed .
we got what we came for and our special relationship is still very special .
prime minister?
i love that word " relationship " .
covers all manner of sins , doesn't it?
i fear that this has become a bad relationship .
a relationship based on the president taking what he wants and casually ignoring all those things that really matter to , erm ...
britain .
we may be a small country but we're a great one , too .
the country of shakespeare , churchill , the beatles ,
sean connery , harry potter .
david beckham's right foot .
david beckham's left foot , come to that .
and a friend who bullies us is no longer a friend .
and since bullies only respond to strength , from now onward ,
i will be prepared to be much stronger .
and the president should be prepared for that .
mr president !
joe .
it's your sister on line four .
all right .
er , yes , i'm very busy and important , how can i help you?
have you gone completely insane?
you can't always be sensible .
'you can if you're prime minister . '
it's the chancellor on the other line .
it isn't !
'i'll call you back . '
no , you won't !
the trouble with being the prime minister's sister is it puts your life into perspective .
what did my brother do today?
he fought for his country .
what did i do?
i made a papier mach lobster head .
what is this we're listening to?
joni mitchell .
i can't believe you still listen to joni mitchell .
i love her and true love lasts a lifetime .
joni mitchell is the woman who taught your cold english wife how to feel .
did she?
oh , well , that's good , i must write to her and say thanks .
which doll for daisy's friend emily?
the one that looks like a transvestite or the one that looks like a dominatrix?
'it's almost enough to make you feel patriotic ,
'so here's one for our arse kicking prime minister .
'a golden oldie for a golden oldie . '
jump ) hold me
i'll give you all that you need
wrap your love around me
you're so excited i can feel you getting hotter
oh baby
i'll take you down , i'll take you down

both sides no moons and junes
and ferris wheels
the dizzy dancing way that you feel
as every fairy tale comes real
i've looked at love that way
but now it's just another show
and you leave 'em laughing when you go
and if you care
don't let them know
don't give yourself away
i've looked at love
from both sides now
from give and take
and still somehow
it's love's illusions that i recall
i really don't know love
i really don't know love at all
tears and fears
and feeling proud
to say i love you right out loud
dreams and schemes
and circus crowds
i've looked at life that way
oh but now old friends ...
oh , my god .
it's a miracle .
you're all dressed .
come on , come on , come on , we're horribly late .
come on , then .
in the car .
in the car .
well something's lost
but something's gained
in living every day
has she noticed you yet?
no .
but the thing about romance is people only get together right at the very end .
of course .
by the way , i feel bad .
i never ask you how your love life is going .
er huh !
no .
as you know , that was a done deal long ago .
unless claudia schiffer calls , in which case i want you out of here straightaway ,
you wee motherless mongrel .
oh !
no , no .
we'll want to have sex in every room , including yours .

and i realised that , as dire chance and fateful cockup would have it , here i am , mid fifties , and without knowing it , i've spent most of my adult life with a chubby employee .
and , much as it grieves me to say it , it might be that the people i love is , in fact ... you .
well , this is a surprise .
yeah .
ten minutes at elton john's and you're gay?
no , look .
i'm serious here .
i left elton's and a hefty number of half naked chicks with their mouths open in order to hang out with you at christmas .

knowing life would always be a little bit worse?
or would you cut and run?

the trouble with love ls )
love can be a many splendored thing
can't deny the joy it brings
a dozen roses , diamond rings
dreams for sale and fairy tales
it'll make you hear a symphony
and you just want the world to see
but like a drug that makes you blind
it'll fool ya every time
the trouble with love is
it can tear you up inside
make your heart believe a lie
it's stronger than your pride
the trouble with love is
it doesn't care how fast you fall
and you can't refuse the call
see you got no say at all
now i was once a fool , it's true
i played the game by all the rules
but now my world's a deeper blue
i'm sadder but i'm wiser too
i swore i'd never love again
i swore my heart would never mend
said love wasn't worth the pain
but then i hear it call my name
the trouble with love is
it can tear you up inside
make your heart believe a lie
it's stronger than your pride
the trouble with love is
it doesn't care how fast you fall
and you can't refuse the call
see you got no say at all
every time i turn around
i think i've got it all figured out
my heart keeps calling and i keep on falling
over and over again
the sad story always ends the same
me standing in the pouring rain
it seems no matter what i do
it tears my heart in two
the trouble with love is the trouble with love
it can tear you up inside it can tear you up inside
make your heart believe a lie make your heart believe a lie
it's stronger than your pride
the trouble with love is it's in your heart , it's in your soul
it doesn't care how fast you fall you're losing that control
and you can't refuse the call
see you got no say at all
the trouble with love is ooh , yeah
jump )
your eyes tell me how you want me
i can feel it in your heartbeat
you're so excited i can feel you getting hotter
oh baby
i'll take you down , i'll take you down
where no one's ever gone before
and if you want more
if you want more , more , more
then jump for my love
jump in
and feel my touch
jump if you want to taste my kisses in the night
then jump for my love
i know my heart i know my heart can make you happy
jump in you know these arms can fill you up
jump if you want to taste my kisses in the night
then jump for my love
