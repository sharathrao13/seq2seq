hello , quinn .
good morning , quinn .
how's it going , mate?
what's up , guys?
working the late shift , are you?
ha !
someone's got to clean up after you guys .
all right , quinn .
oi , oi , oi .
come on , then .
you're not havin 'one yourself , then?
no .
i'm trying to cut back .
you heard from the school , then , didn't you?
down you go .
good night , lads . ... see you , karen . ... great work .
have a good weekend .
oi , karen , here's the new recruit . ... employment office is up top . ... hi , mum !
quinn , how are you , mate?
have you been smoking?
no , i told you ...
i only smoke when i've been drinking .
what's wrong?
nothing .
quinn ... what is it?
you've got something you want to show me .
you know what it says .
scholarship was worth ... 3, 000 a year .
we don't have that sort of money .
maybe we could ask dad to pay .
sorry .
karen?
what?
got a problem at number 4 .
jess says he's hit some sort of a void .
oh , that bitch hasn't a clue to what she's doing .
hey ...
quinn .
and what brings you to the arsehole of the world?
you're passing through it .
what's that make you?
ha .
here .
why don't you go inside and have a wee look?
oh .
wicked .
whoa .
... i know it's still ... ... well , i covered it .
what ...
quinn !
mum , there's something in there .
there's something in the hole !
damn it , jess !
it's unsafe conditions !
here .
let's look at this void .
it's unsafe !
i'm just going to wash your eyes out , okay?
mum , we've got to go !
no , no .
we've got to do this fast .
open your eyes .
open them up .
open them .
oh .
give me that .
get in !
mum , there was something in there !
... come here ! ... [ gasps ]
come on !
come on !
mum !
ahhhhhhh !
mum?
mum?
mum?
i've kept this for years , because someday it will be up to you .
i don't want you to be afraid .
i want you to understand .
knowledge is the only weapon we've got left .
in the beginning , it was ignorance that destroyed us .
i saw the first , but soon the world saw millions .
no one knew how they spawned so fast .
they swarmed like locusts , burning everything in their path , driven by one purpose ... to feed .
even then , we couldn't believe they were real .
ancient man had made them into myths , but nature had made something far more terrible .
too late , our scientists discovered their true identity ... a species which had burned the dinosaurs to dust , whose ash had brought on ice ages , who , in eons past , had scorched the world clean of life ,
5 ... 4 ... 3 ... ... waiting to start their cycle anew . ... 2 ... 1 . ... our weapons shot fire back at them , yet for every one of them killed , a hundred took its place .
they seemed invulnerable .
we could only look on as our leaders used their greatest arsenal to destroy them .
... but in the end , we only helped them , till the world burned and the few of us that were left fled the cities , found shelter where we could .
... you have to understand our past because you will decide our future .
they're starving now , and they're more dangerous than ever .
but we have to go on .
we have to outlast them .
only one species is getting out of this alive .
hey , quinn !
come and have a look at this !
it's a straight drop now from the water tower .
you just pull the plug , 500 gallons per minute hits the walls .
don't care about the specs , jerry .
1, 200 centigrade ... can it take it?
yeah .
course it can .
remember , i used to build blast furnaces for a living .
i know all about fire .
of course you do .
sorry , mate .
nice one .
eddie's gone psycho . ... jared? ... yeah , quinn?
keep 'em at it .
no slacking !
you heard him .
no slacking .
go !
man : ...
i shall always walk .
ye , though his brethren rose
like locusts from the earth , quinn , ... no weapon could save me ! ... yeah . ... no fire could extinguish theirs ! ... yeah . ... they will prepare ... ... cheers , mate .
what's up , quinn?
what are you doing , eddie?
me and a few others , we're going harvesting , quinn .
no , you're not .
it's not ready .
we spoke about this .
half the stuff's not ripe .
you pick it now , it won't germinate .
that means no seeds .
that means nothing to plant next season .
there won't be a next season .
we'll be starved to death .
what is this?
we can do it , eddie .
we decided , all of us , you as well ... dig in , work together , outlast them .
kids can't eat hope , quinn .
edinburgh's gone .
we haven't heard from pembury or norwich in two years !
we're on our own , quinn .
yeah , we know that .
that's why we have to hang on .
maybe we are all that's left .
eight years i've listened to you , and for what?
two kids and a wife buried on the road .
i'm not losing these , quinn , not when there's food out there .
... sorry , eddie .
you're not going anywhere . ... give me the keys . ... you bloody take 'em from me .
it's a community , not a prison .
eddie ... you can argue as much as you like .
it makes no difference .
the point is , if you go out those gates , then you jeopardize this community ... you can stay out there , because you're not coming back .
... all right .
i'm keeping these .
hey , quinn .
you know , i'm your best friend , and sometimes even i don't like you .
sorry .
join me , " the black knight says ,
then we can end this conflict forever .
never !
... [ grunts ]
aah !
i'll never join you , " the white knight says .
you killed my father .
aah !
aah !
creedy !
the black knight stares through the holes in his shiny mask , and he speaks words that burn into our hero's heart forever .
i ... am your father .
no !
did you make that up , mr. quinn?
course i did .
all right , kids .
time for bed . ... no ! ... one more ! ... no !
tomorrow .
no , no .
prayers first .
tomorrow ! ... " the lion king " ! ... yeah ! ... yeah !
tomorrow !
prayers first !
okay .
ready?
what do we do when we wake?
keep both eyes on the sky .
what do we do when we sleep?
keep one eye on the sky .
what do we do when we see them?
dig hard , dig deep , run for shelter , and never look back .
well done .
good night , guys .
bedtime .
bedtime !
good night .
why can't we stay up later?
michael?
quinn's asleep .
i took the keys .
let's go .
you keep quiet .
... [ gasps ] ... hello , liam .
willem says it's dragon breath .
don't you listen to him .
it's just the wind .
okay .
oh , god .
ajay , alarm .
take cover , kids .
come on , now .
there we go , then .
okay , children !
head up !
one at a time !
1 ... 2 ...
single file .
single file .
let's move !
right .
move the kids .
let's go .
come on .
creedy? ... yeah? ... you got a count?
yeah .
we're good .
quinn !
quinn !
in the field .
... [ gasps ]
dragons !
go get eddie .
rachel !
rachel !
i'm here !
devon !
devon ! ... devon ! ... michael ! ... d ... where's michael? ... michael?
michael !
michael !
you okay?
... where's matt? ... he's dead .
eddie !
let's go !

ahhhhhh !
ahhhhhh !
... come on !
go ! ... come on , michael !
go !

keep going !
come on !
ahhhhh !
dad ... w what'll we do?
we're trapped !
come on !
go ! ... move it ! ... hurry up !
go !
come on !
quick !
get in there !

you okay?
devon !
come on , creedy .
come on , creedy ! ... it's gonna blow up ! ... back up !
back up !
back up !
... oh , my god !
back up !
i'm going as fast as i can !
back up !
back up !
back up !
stop !
quinn , stop ! ... let me bloody go ! ... no !
no , quinn !
devon's there !
devon !!
devon !!
he doesn't care about us .
he just wants the damn ash off that field .
creedy's one and only black label , aged two weeks in a steel barrel .
now , the secret's swallowing fast .
that way it just burns your stomach and not your throat .
go on .
sip it and weep .
poor bastard .
huh?
who?
eddie?
a father's not meant to bury his kids .
it's supposed to be the other way around .
yeah , well , he wouldn't have had to ... if he'd just listened , would he? ... no .
no , creedy .
maybe he was right .
it's easy to square your shoulders and bear it when you don't have kids .
maybe there won't be another harvest .
no .
not now , with half the crop gone .
god knows how we're going to get through .
you remember when we'd go out and bring in 80 % , 90 % of it?
not anymore .
not in the last few years .
they're hungrier , too .
hey ... you're not giving up on me , are you?
no .
i just thought if we could hang on , somehow we'd make it through .
this is a national civil defense alert for all who can hear this ...
man # 2 : ... no choice but to authorize the use of nuclear weapons ...
the sole survivor was a 1 2 year old boy ...
roger that .
i'm going in .
stay high on my ...
charge all weapons .
hey , barlow , i've got voices .
ajay , what are you smoking?
take a look .
a look at what?
she's not moving .
forget the bird and use the scope , you wanker .
oh , dear .
creedy !
creedy !
... i've got to go .
all right , lads , this isn't a drill !
move it along !
get those out .
one to creedy .
another one to jared !
here's creedy's .
all right , all right !
come on , then !
come on !
extra shells !
come on !
we haven't got all day !
marauders .
years since we've seen them .
well , look on the bright side .
at least we're not alone .
oh .
only one thing worse than a dragon ...
americans .
oh , what a dump .
who's in charge? !
well , that would be you , then .
anything happens , you know what to do .
uh , no .
i have no idea .
me neither .
that's a big tank .
you responsible for this place?
who are you?
name's van zan , kentucky irregulars .
you're a long way from home , van zan .
you lost?
rebuilt a national guard c5a .
flew it 8, 000 miles on 2 engines and tried to set it down on the old strip outside of manchester .
lost 1 22 men and most of my fuel .
we need shelter and a place to refit artillery .
we'll be out of your hair by 1 800 hours tomorrow .
that's a good story , especially the bit about the plane , but there hasn't been anything in the air for 20 years .
that's their territory .
it's my territory .
it's your territory .
they're just rentin 'it .
turn around , van zan .
don't be a fool .
we can do this easy ... or we can do it real easy .
you try it .
you ever seen one of these?
not many men have .
got it off the first one i killed .
the plane was better .
so now you're a dragon killer .
that's not even original .
it was in a wheat field just south of coffeyville , kansas .
it was late november .
it's a month of mist .
and we were caught in the open .
the sun was setting behind us .
there was nowhere to run .
twice it came in on us , and twice it missed the heart of us .
and that's when i had an epiphany .
you see , they have great vision ... in the day .
and they have even better vision at night .
but in the failing light , they can't focus .
magic hour .
coffeyville .
it's etched in american history because the outlaw dalton boys were killed there .
ordinary townsfolk rose up and took 'em down .
maybe you're the dalton boys .
no , no ... we're the townsfolk .
you try anything ...
i'll kill you .
didn't get your name .
quinn .
well ...
i'm sure you've got a perfectly good explanation for this , but i'm buggered if i know what it is .
he's a dragon slayer .
a what?
he's a dragon slayer !
oh , he's a dragon slayer .
oh , good .
and i suppose that makes you king arthur , does it?
christ almighty , quinn .
i mean , even if you believe that , and you'd have to be an imbecile , ... do you not think we'd be easy meat for these guys? ... you weren't there .
look at this guy .
look .
look .
i mean , he looks like ... like a ...
like a rogue marine .
you remember those guys?
oh , yeah , sure .
they blew up plenty of dragons in their time , but they also took half the world ...
you weren't there !
i saw his eyes , creedy !
move it !
move it !
move it !
great job .
we ran a 30 mile grid in every direction ... nothing .
could be on the moon , denton .
quinn , this is alexandra jensen , u. s. cavalry .
oh .
captain creedy .
hey .
how you doin '?
creedy .
denton van zan .
how are you?
excuse me .
who are they?
archangels .
huh?
1 7 seconds ... once they jump from the chopper , that's their life expectancy .
you never thought of giving them parachutes?
they're not much help .
they're bulla men .
what?
they were used by gladiators to snare other men .
not men , dragons .
so , you guys , uh , jump out the chopper and use a net to snare dragons?
mm hmm .
ha .
i mean , sure , yeah .
i mean [ laughs ] you would , wouldn't you?
three watches , eight hours each .
all the kids in the shelter .
rifles on the keep and walls .
excuse me .
aren't you forgetting who let them in?
don't mean i trust 'em .
all right , guys .
i just brewed a fresh pot , if that's what you're looking for .
a whetstone , actually .
sure .
is that your son?
no .
got him from the pound .
hmm .
is that where you get all your children?
i found him in a village near bray .
3 years old , sitting with his mum .
he kept trying to wake her up .
she had been dead for days .
we were making our way up here , a few of us ... me , creedy , and barlow .
no idea how we were gonna survive .
anyway , i grabbed him .
what else was i gonna do?
leave him .
most men would have ... especially back in the early years .
everybody's just running for their lives .
yeah .
well , i didn't .
regretted it ever since , of course .
what are you doing here?
what do you want?
you want to know anything , you ask van zan .
goosh , you alive? !
not even close , denton .
alex !
radios are down !
cover the east ridge and tell me what you see !
men , get ready to rock 'n 'roll !
we got a dragon to kill ! ... goosh , set the triangulators ! ... roger that !
tito , mead , piscatella , bounce your butts !
move out !
alex , what do you see?
no sign of it .
visibility is about 3 miles on the deck .
roger that .
stay on the deck till i get the verticals up .
copy that , van zan .
waiting for triangulator .
safety first , guys .
safety? !
what part of this job do you find safe? !
it's not you i'm worried about .
it's my chopper .
oh .
cold .
ha ha ha ha !
first vertical's up .
vertical 1 up , alex .
copy that .
second vertical is up .
second vertical is up , alex .
now , once i have radar , you go to 5 , 000 feet .
fly directly back above my location .
gideon , you and the boys bring that bitch right down on my head , and i'll take it from there .
copy that , van zan .
alvarez , you're the bait .
jefferson , you and i are the gunners .
we don't open our chutes until you give us confirmation that it's down , right?
bogey on our tail , 200 yards ! ... go , go , go , go ! ... roger !
i'll try to lose it up in the clouds .
piscatella , do you read me?
god damn it , piscatella !
get your vertical up !
come on , number 3 !
piscatella , that's you !
i'm almost there !
i'm almost at the top of the ...
god damn it , piscatella .
come in .
ajay?
can you hear anything?
van zan's trying to take it on , quinn , using some kind of 3 d mapping device .
if they don't get that third vertical up ,
alex is flying blind .
hyah !
ha !
hyah !
yah !
come on !
van zan , what's going on?
i'm at altitude .
we're blind up here .
can you give me some time?
i'm having trouble with the third vertical .
come on , number 3 !
piscatella , that's you !
get your vertical up !
all right , piscatella .
third vertical's up .
alex , we have visual .
monitor's coming up .
hold on !
alvarez !
it's right on us !
it's right on us !
go , go , go , go , go , go , go , go !
damn it !
talk to me , alex !
angels are flying .
alex , do you have a reading? !
okay .
target ... 1, 500 feet .
copy that .
alvarez , do you have a visual? !
negative .
damn it !
it's right on top of me !
shoot !
shoot at what? !
i can't see a thing !
nets away !
great shot !
all right , jefferson !
roger that .
alvarez , can you see it?
negative .
i think it's down .
copy that .
shit !
alex , both nets just flew right by me .
alvarez , can you confirm that it is down?
copy that !
negative !
it's on me !
ahhhhhhh !
jefferson , i'm not getting any contact with alvarez .
keep your eyes open .
roger that . ... jefferson , look out ! ... oh , my ...
gideon's down .
piscatella . ... piscatella , do you read me? ... van zan .
who is this?
quinn .
quinn , where's piscatella? ... he's gone . ... are you ready to ride?
'cause you got about 30 seconds till the bitch is on top of you .
you bring her to me .
you're the bait , quinn , 1, 600 pounds of horseflesh .
ride her right down my throat .
do you read me?
ride the north road to the quarry .
bring her to me , quinn .
i'm coming .
hmm?
here we go .
okay .
okay .
come on !
line up 20 yards south by southwest !
come on !
come on !
1, 200 yards .
wind velocity ... 1 0 . 2 north by northwest .
come on !
come on !
hyah !
yeah , this is really good stuff .
thanks . i don't a care about that ... got a new fool ... hey , good day , quinn , yeah? ... i'd like to laugh at ... all right , quinn . i have only one burning desire
hats off to you , mate .
yeah !
... stand , baby  listen here , baby  and stop actin 'so crazy  you say your mom ain't home  it ain't my concern  just a play with me  and you won't get burned  i have only one itchin 'desire  let me stand next to your fire  let me stand , yeah  let me stand , baby  let me stand
envy the country that has heroes , huh? !
i say pity the country that needs 'em .
what are you celebrating?
one dragon down , three men dead?
oh , yeah .
at that rate , we might just be getting somewhere in about 320 years .
is that what you want?
you want a little accommodation?
unh unh .
these beasts live on ash .
they feed on death .
there's no middle ground ... not for them , not for us .
and sure as hell not for my men who died out there today .
but you go ahead .
have your little ... soiree .
personally , you disgust me .
we bury our dead at dawn .
what are you doing here , quinn?
you're standing on ground where i've buried hundreds .
this is my home .
i'm asking the questions .
what are you doing here?
i lead ... you follow .
i kept these for you .
they sent them off proud , alex .
alex is the keeper of the dead , quinn .
she's our memory .
when this thing is over , she's gonna build a wall with those things .
and , unfortunately , it's gonna be a very long wall .
i'm out of resources , quinn .
i'm out of men .
alex , tell him . ... did you see the one we brought down , the big bull? ... yeah .
well , it wasn't .
it was a female .
there was at least one egg , probably more .
we've hit over 200 of them , and as far as we can tell , they're all females .
how about you , quinn?
you ever seen a male?
i don't know .
when i'm running for my life ,
i don't stop to look at the plumbing .
well , we have .
alex discovered it about two years back .
she worked out how the fire in the glands ...
two glands in the mouth secrete separate chemicals , yep .
that's right .
combine in exhalation ... nitro napalm .
yeah .
well , the chemical engineer is dead now .
that was his theory .
we figure they're like fish .
the females spawn the eggs .
one male passes over and fertilizes thousands .
did you hear what she said , quinn?
one male .
that's why we never see any others , 'cause there's only one .
now , we tracked the epidemiology of these things , and we found out where they're from .
and that is why we're here .
we kill the male , we kill the species .
we're going to london .
good luck .
it's that way .
no , i need soldiers . ... quinn , are you listening to me?
i need men ... ... men from pembury went to london .
and maybe she's right , because they disturbed something .
90 of them died , and then it backtracked them to their fortress .
and you haven't seen destruction like that , van zan ... not even in this world .
so we walk over dead men ...
not with my people , you won't !
i've got a castle full of them .
i'm trying to keep them alive .
you're just letting them die slower .
i said no .
i made a mistake letting you through those gates .
i saw something in your eyes .
i thought it was awe .
i was wrong .
it's madness .
you're insane .
and i want you out before you do more damage .
look out the window .
eden's not burning .
it's burnt .
why don't you want to go?
what happened there?
my mother was working on a railway tunnel ... project engineer .
she died there , okay?
you've seen it , haven't you?
quinn !
trouble .
there's nothing magical about 'em .
they're made up of a collection of organs .
they have a mind , a heart , and a liver .
you take out one of these , you bring down the beast !
is that it?
four of you?
eddie .
eddie , what you doin '?
you got kids , man .
that's why i'm going , creedy .
that's why .
the volunteer section of this campaign's now over .
it's time for the draft . ... tito , mead ...
get the six strongest men they have and load 'em up . ... right . ... got it .
dig your own holes .
die in 'em .
oi !
i said no !
no , quinn !
ugh !
huh !
huh ! ... get out of my way , quinn . ... ahhhhhhh !
ugh !
ooh !
uh !
ugh !
huh !
uh !
uh !
uh !
ah !
oh !
ah !
uh !
... huh ! ... ooh ! ... huh ! ... ugh !
ugh !
okay , okay .
get him off !
i'll kill ya !
i'll kill ya !
i'll kill ya !
i'll kill ya ! ... that's what we need . ... i'll kill ya !
he's gonna bring it back here !
all right .
all right , he's had enough .
go , london !
come on !
move 'em out !
come on !
grab those guys !
you , you , you !
he would have killed you .
he doesn't feel things .
that's the only way he can do what he does .
here .
take this .
iodine .
hurts like hell , but it kills anything .
good luck , quinn .
you too busy to say goodbye?
you're not my father .
you can't stop me , quinn .
i can be an archangel .
gideon says he'll teach me .
1 7 seconds .
did he tell you that's how long they live?
not the good ones .
gideon's an 8 year veteran .
at least they're still killing them .
a couple of years , jared .
that's all i'm asking for .
give me that .
after that , you'll be old enough , and you can lead 'em .
that's what i want .
out of everyone , you're the best .
it's a waste of time , quinn ... all of it .
you're right .
i'm not your father .
i can't ...
iock you in .
i can't make you stay .
and if you think you're man enough to speak like that , then i guess you're man enough to go .
goodbye , jared .
you look after yourself .
that dragon smells like shit .
are you gonna burn it?
i love it .
they hate the smell of their dead .
it's the only thing that scares 'em .
it might buy us a couple of days .
sorry , quinn .
so am i.
this time i was thinking i got rid of you for sure .
van zan , what are we doing?
do you see a way through?
negative .
it's blocked for miles .
as far as the river , denton .
head back , alex . ... find me a way around . ... copy .
is this pembury? ... this looks like pembury .
do you want to turn back?
nukes must have done this .
nukes didn't do this .
should we set the triangulators?
no time .
man the 50 cal , lock and load , cut the engines , and take your positions .
you heard him !
lock and load !
... let's move !
let's move !
i think it's playing with us .
it's not playing with us .
it's setting us up .
ahhhhhhh !
ahhhhhhhh !
ahhhhhhh !
easy .
easy .
easy , girl .
van zan , it's alex .
can you read me?
van zan , can you hear me?
van zan , if you can hear me , i'm coming back .
can anybody hear me?
van zan !
van zan !
van zan !
denton ... what happened?
it was him .
where are the soldiers?
one pass .
he flew over just once .
the castle .
hyah !
hyah !
hyah !
hyah !
hyah !
get the hell out of there !
take cover , everybody !
get it moving !
hyah !
anybody upstairs? !
hyah !
jared !
... creedy ! ... quinn !

creedy , help !
i'll get him !
you take her downstairs !
hurry up !
that big boy won't stop until it's killed us all !
katie ... she won't move .
come on , katie .
willem , get on my shoulder .
katie , come on .
let go of the wall .
let go .
let go !
take her !
take her !
everybody , move to the back !
i've got all the kids .
okay , keep pushing up .
katie's blanket .
where is everyone? !
don't you go up there , quinn !
there's 65 people up there , creedy .
i'm going !
god damn it , quinn .
don't you dare leave !
it's too dangerous !
i'll clean it up .
creedy !
ugh !
noooo !
creedy !
ahh !
no !
no !
what do we do when we wake?
keep both eyes on the sky .
what do we do ...
what do we ...
what do we do when we sleep?
keep one eye on the sky .
what do we do when we see him?
dig hard , dig deep , run for shelter , and never look back .
jared ...
we're alive !
we're in here !
push !
ugh !
agh !
back away !
you were right .
i salvaged what i could from your armory .
we got one rifle , two automatics , two crossbows , and explosive heads .
you , me , and alex ... down the coast in the chopper .
stay tight to the cliffs .
the thames will take us right into the heart of london .
i know where he lives .
magic hour ... you say that's when they're the weakest .
we'll see .
you're going home .
jared !
yeah , quinn?
you keep them safe .
... [ gasps ]
well , this town's gone to hell .
they must have heard us coming .
what's stopping them?
it's not us .
either way , we gotta get in there .
come on , guys .
we're outnumbered hundreds to 3 .
i know this city from the sky down , and i know it from the bottom up .
if we can get in quiet , i can sneak us into some tunnels .
that should get us close .
good christ .
did he see us?
they must be starving .
they're eating their own .
oh , we're dead .
look on the bright side .
now we've got him outnumbered 3 to 1 .
now ... you ready?
yeah .
quinn ...
you lead .
we follow .
there's an underground passage ...
leads to the construction site !
down here !
... [ grunts ]
... [ grunts ]
clear .
four tunnels meet at this shaft .
leads up to a square .
there used to be buildings up there .
if they're still around , could be good coverage .
yeah , if it goes to the street , that's what we take .
alex , give me the sticks .
quinn , these are highly volatile heads .
you fire them with your crossbow . ... now , when you ...
he knows we're here .
shh .
okay .
how tall is that shaft?
1 50 feet .
all right .
here's the plan ... when we get to street level , we gotta bring that bull's ass to the ground , and i'm gonna take care of that .
now , one shot's gonna kill him , and it's gonna be with this .
he only exposes his chest before he breathes fire .
now , these are magnesium tip c 4 arrows , and they only fly about 50 feet .
so , when you fire , you gotta be standing in the furnace .
so do not hesitate .
if you do , we die .
ah , he's playing hide and seek .
more like cat and mouse .
quinn !
use it !
oh , he's eating it up .
i can't see a damn thing , quinn .
what am i looking at?
this is an enclosed square .
it's about 1 00 meters across .
there's a building right in the middle .
that chimney looks down over the lot of it .
what do you think?
i don't know yet .
... hey ... you scared?
no .
it was your idea to come to london .
yeah , i thought i'd be at 3, 500 feet .
yeah , i thought i'd have over 200 men with me right now .
life's got a funny way of turning out different , though , don't it?
yeah .
... yeah . ... yeah .
see that railcar?
it'll give us a better view .
move .
drop your packs ... weapons only .
okay , we're gonna have a window ... 1 0 , maybe 1 2 seconds every time he makes a turn , and we're gonna use it . ... how? ... we're gonna split up .
we stay together , take a hit , and we're gone , so we gotta use every angle .
now , quinn , you're gonna take that west wall .
don't lock and load till you get there .
you got it?
okay .
what about you?
i got the north .
alex , i need you to stay right here .
now , when quinn and i make a move , it's gonna draw him off , and i don't think the son of a bitch can count .
now , he's gonna make another turn .
when he does , i'm gonna tell you to go . ... you're gonna run like hell to that east wall .
don't think about it ... ... it's water !
keep it .
you're gonna need it .
we have paid a terrible price .
and now we got a chance to make a difference .
we will .
now , that's our first window .
quinn ...
move !
ahhh !
ahhh !
the arrows .
alex !
in about 8 seconds , we're gonna have a window !
now , when i tell you to go , you run like hell straight to the base of this chimney !
are you ready? !
go !
go !
no !
run like the wind , baby !
come on , big boy !
that's right .
uh !
ahhhhhhhhh !
quinn !
alex !
stop !
i'm fine .
what are we gonna do?
i lost the explosives .
we're gonna find 'em .
keep going !
... go around the other side !
i'll slow him down !
he's not moving .
he's waiting for us .
quinn ... by the truck ... the arrow .
by the wheel .
no !
die !
he always thought you could do it .
and you did .
come on .
quinn !
quinn !
quinn !
we got a signal !
quinn !
we got a signal .
well , what's the problem?
they're speaking french .
well , don't come to me .
i'm lousy at french .
they want to speak to the person in charge .
ah ...
well , that would be you , then .
just keep 'em talking .
get us a good bottle of wine or something .
go on , now .
thanks , quinn .
go on , all of you . ... all right .
cheers . ... well done !
you think it'll last?
i don't know .
it's been , what , three months since we saw the last one?
if they come , they'll burn , we'll build .
... or maybe i'll just kill 'em .
and here i thought optimism was against your nature .
it's a recent development .
well , here's to evolution .
these embers burn down low  and with my face aglow  you are all i know  set this place on fire  let the flames rise higher  and as they reach the ceiling  at your feet i'm kneeling
drawing ever near  my cause revealed as clear  yes , i burn for you here  set this place on fire  let the flames rise higher  and as they reach the ceiling  at your feet i'm kneeling  with every trailing plume  know it bears me home  let it burn  let it burn
find me  i'm falling  and fooling myself that it's flight  imperfect  i plummet  and ponder  pushed away on principle  walk away and i stare  would you stand me up again?  wonder if i've said too much  and we'll never speak again
forfeit  my future  for feelings of few far betweens  mindless  of merciful  measures  making ends preempt the means  and i searched your eyes for an answer  and shuddered at what i found there  as my skin shrunk away from conclusion  that you lack the strength to care  walk away and i stare  would you stand me up again?  wonder if i've said too much  and we'll never speak again  never speak again
