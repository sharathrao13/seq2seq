remember alfred himmelmann?
the nazi you wanted to find?
you can put it that way .
he" s half dead .
who cares?
i do .
he wiped out all the jews from an entire area of germany .
hardly anyone survived except me , your mother and a few others .
himmelmann lived in argentina all these years .
some dirty deal with the government protected him .
two months ago he disappeared .
we don" t know where to .
what did you have in mind?
himmelmann has a son in germany , whom we always kept an eye on .
he" s not a child himself , has two adult children .
the daughter met an israeli and moved to a kibbutz .
and a son in berlin .
how do i fit in?
the son is coming to visit his sister .
she" s worried about all the suicide bombers .
so she called a travel agency to hire a tour guide and i thought ...
what?
take him to the holocaust museum?
i think if you get close to them , we" ii learn about the grandfather .
and i need someone who speaks german .
menachem , let" s be honest here .
no one gives a damn anymore .
he" ii die by himself soon enough .
i want to get him before god does .
hello?
where?
rishon le zion?
shit !
how many killed?
call yaakov !
what do you mean no answer?
call again !
menachem !
he hasn" t come through yet .
so dial again .
i heard about it .
galit !
menachem !
shit , cell phones are dead .
every time a bomb goes off ...
never mind , they" ii come back soon .
fuck them !
twelve people killed .
pia !
pia !
you must be eyal !
yes .
hello !
pia !
i figured .
thank you .
i just picked him up .
he was scared when he heard about the bomb .
you speak too fast !
little hebrew ... but i am learn ...
great .
and so hansel and gretel kept fighting .
very dramatic .
what do you say?
you" re wrong .
there" s something there .
you have to keep pushing .
be focused .
i am focused .
what do you want?
what" s going on?
that" s my question .
we" re finished soon and l" ii be back .
right , menachem?
when do we start training?
no rush .
carry on with this .
l" ii come back .
something you" re hiding from me?
no problem .
l" ii go .
relax .
shit .
he says his grandfather is dead .
l" m stuck with this pseudo liberal who talks about suicide bombers " motives .
i almost punched him .
calm down .
what did he say about his grandfather?
he doesn" t have one .
find out more .
maybe he doesn" t know .
maybe ...
maybe he thinks he" s dolly the clone sheep and never had one .
stop acting like a child .
maybe you do need a therapist .
i don" t need to host a patronizing german peacenik for the foreign ministry .
why are you getting so uptight?
it" s not like you .
relax , have some fun .
and if you happen to learn something ...
whatever .
l" ve got to go now .
call me later .
the sea of galilee .
a talent show
thanks !
thanks a lot !
thank you , tom .
and now we have a surprise .
our pia and her brother axel .
go for it pia !
they said something about a party , but with no details .
forget it , menachem .
they" ii be here any minute .
l" m taking him to the dead sea .
via the jordan valley .
during the day it" s safe , don" t worry .
l" ii show him jericho .
he wants to see palestinians .
he" s such a nudnik .
i won" t stop in jericho , don" t worry .
i might drown him in the dead sea .
might be a world news scoop .
okay , menachem .
they" re here , i gotta go .
bye !
fire at will ...
shit !
what" s up?
you" re working hard , eh?
too many female singers .
what?
nothing .
l" m just ...
you" re not ...
do you have to report this?
could you just ...
it" s okay .
there" s nothing wrong .
it" s not that bad .
go home .
have a nice weekend .
rest .
don" t worry .
look , it" s a problem .
the guy" s in complete denial .
he" s been through a trauma .
it might be risky to send him on such a complicated job .
are you saying that just so you can keep him?
l" ii be done with him in 2 days .
it" s fine with me .
you know what?
check his results from today" s practice .
i bet he wasn" t good .
i don" t know .
i can" t give him up .
he did a terrific job with abu ibrahim .
i need him .
i can insist he sees rudy .
l" ii convince him he" s not just any shrink , but the chief counselor .
am i interrupting?
no .
just asking when you" ii be done with this bullshit .
just a couple of days more .
menachem , we need to talk .
just a second .
let me finish with gello .
take this .
check the extra material on himmelmann .
extra material?
i told you he" s dead .
what do you want?
sorry .
too much desert .
l" ii be sitting outside , reading .
take your time .
what can i get you , sweetie?
sweetie?
okay then , not sweetie .
three heinekens .
an arab?
stay out of this !
give back the money !
100?
you should be ashamed .
you won" t get a better price .
i promise .
here .
100 .
take back 20 .
you get it for 80 .
you" re trying to cheat?
give me the money .
20 , 40 , 60 , 80 ...
that" s it .
only 20?
what are you thinking?
i forgot you germans are so sensitive .
human misery always touched your hearts .
can i say one sentence?
go ahead .
you jews are so obsessed with what was done to you in the past .
maybe if you let go , you" d be able to see ... that" s already 3 sentences .
okay .
thanks for the ride .
you" re welcome .
this is all that" s left of a full public bus after another suicide bomber blew himself up .
the terrorist , driving a 4x4 suv , stopped behind the bus while it was picking up passengers at this station ...
it" s 102 fm radio tel aviv , and as usual we play you soft music after a suicide bombing .
so have a better day .
a relaxed day .
you tell him .
i feel wrong about it , anyway .
no problem .
it should come from me .
l" ii keep him busy with himmelmann .
how long will this nazi shit continue?
isn" t this thing getting too expensive?
don" t worry , i talked to the boss .
your ass is covered , i ...
hello , eyal .
did he catch his plane?
yes , he" s gone .
could" ve told me he" s homo .
why does it matter?
did you spend two weeks with him?
a real homo homo?
no , a half homo .
did he have wandering hands?
he try to touch you?
i take it you really had fun .
l" m not amused at all .
here" s your last disc .
i didn" t even listen to it .
l" m done with this .
l" m ready for the new operation .
okay , l" ii leave you alone .
i can" t believe you got me mixed up with this crap .
touring around with ...
i mean , l" ve got nothing against him , but everyone" s started training .
i missed three days already .
listen !
they decided you" re not ...
i told you ...
i warned you .
what?
l" m sorry .
i tried .
i told them you were really good with the germans .
that you are in great shape .
fuck !
those mother ... !
who do they think they are?
i started this mission and l" m supposed to finish it !
what other agent would do such a clean job?
i ...
forget it .
don" t take it so bad .
there will be other operations ...
l" ve had enough of you !
enough of you and of your stupid nazi games !
hello .
hello .
menachem asked me to deliver this .
he wants you to listen to this .
thanks , i ...
do you need it back?
no .
i ...
if l" m not needed l" ii just leave .
thanks .
something to eat?
no thanks .
we just gorged on " curry wurst .
oh , gourmets !
how do you do?
hello .
hello .
what are you doing here?
watching over you .
i don" t understand .
calm down .
introduce me , then l" ii go .
l" m staying here .
room 223 .
axel , nice to have you here .
hi !
come on , give me that .
that , too .
yes , yes ...
he" s alive .
he" s here at the villa .
sit down .
he" s there .
i saw him .
i thought he" d come .
he" s very old , but we can get him out .
there are no bodyguards , just a nurse .
take this .
are you crazy?
let" s get him out and bring him to trial in israel .
eyal !
it" s really no problem .
we can do it , just the two of us .
we just need a car and we" ii drive him to the pickup point .
you don" t get it .
nobody knows .
what d" you mean?
we" re ...
there" s no we , no car , no pickup .
you have to finish this yourself .
only you .
terminate him !
terminate him?
yes .
terminate .
but menachem ...
we can get him out .
eyal , listen carefully .
why did you come here?
to find this man , right?
now you" ve found him .
so maybe he" s half dead , but only half .
and this is our chance .
not to let him escape without punishment .
go !
do the right thing .
for me , for your mother .
go !
don" t be afraid .
get him before god does?
yes .
get him before god does .
