i used to imagine that i'd been given to the wrong family at birth and that somewhere in the world my real people longed for me .
from where my father stood my failure to dog paddle was only the first of many failures .
failure to speak clearly .
failure to sit up straight .
failure to make friends every time we moved to another dreary upstate town .
in me , my father recognized a failed life his own .
when i got admitted to the junior college my father figured it was a clerical error .
when i dropped out a year later he wasn't surprised .
quoyle !
quoyle !
job not stimulating enough for you?
no .
i mean , yes .
i mean ...
this is the best work i've ever had .
i stumbled into adulthood
learning to separate my feelings from my life ... counting on nothing .
i got used to being invisible .
until ... someone noticed me .
i'm sick of this shit !

oh , my god .

i guess 'cause i ...
i burn up so many calories .
you live in a dump , quoyle .
i love you .

it's time for your mother and i to put an end to it .
i left instructions with the undertaker
dayton & sons .

nobody gave me nothing .
other men would've given up and turned into bums but i didn't .
i went without so you could have advantages .
not that you done anything with them .
what , were they sick or something?
oh , come on .
they must've left something .
what's their house worth?

there's nothing left .
there were medical bills , and funeral costs , and ...
it's all gone , honey .

i won't have to go to school?
it's an adventure .
who goes to school when they're on an adventure?

she's , uh , six years old .
and petal .
petal , yes ...
agnis hamm .
half sister of guy quoyle .
i'm your aunt .
this is a really bad time .
so i heard .
i'm here to visit his ashes .
no , i mean this is a really , really bad time .
she's never done anything like this .
i mean , she's walked out before but she's never , never taken bunny .
i don't understand .
the potato chips won't do you any good .
drink your tea .
huh?
tea's a good drink .
keep you going .
do you think maybe you could stick around for awhile?
sorry , just passing through .
on my way to newfoundland , where our people come from .
you ever been there , nephew?
only i want to say farewell to guy first if you'll tell me where he is .
oh .
uh , sorry .
he's the one on the left .
petal , hello !
is that you?
hello?
mr. quoyle?
oh .
uh , yes , it is .
this is investigator danzig from the new york state police .
oh , jesus , have you found 'em?
yes , sir .
yeah?
ow !
jesus !
goddamn it !
hang on a second .
hello?
yes , sir , i'm still here .
are you ...?
oh , thank god .
hello .
can you hear me?
that's not a problem .
yeah .
uh , how's bunny?
you know what
i think she's gonna be all right .
oh , jesus , good .
and , and petal?
mr. quoyle we'll talk about that when we get there .
uh huh .
you're gonna , you're gonna bring her here?
yes , sir .
okay .
and you have the address?
yes , we do .
oh , good .
and petal?
relax , sir , we'll be there as soon as we can .
okay , thank you .
thank you .
they're gonna bring petal ; they're gonna bring bunny .
they found 'em .
the cop said he's got something to tell me about petal .
i hope she didn't get in any trouble .
she's got such a temper on her .
there's just no telling what she ...
the convertible went over a guardrail in jersey .
fortunately , your daughter was no longer traveling with mrs. quoyle and , uh , and her male companion .
she was mercifully killed on impact
i can promise you .
look , uh , there is something else .
seems she sold your daughter to a black market adoption outfit for $6, 000 .
there was even a receipt , if you can imagine .
that's how we tracked her .
daddy !
daddy !
hi , sweetheart .
who's that?
that's your great aunt agnis .
where's petal?
mommy !
mommy?
mommy?
maybe i could stay just a day or two .
your loved one has not left your heart
or your thoughts but is sleeping peacefully .
she's sleeping?
yes .
peacefully .
in heaven .
with the angels .
if i was asleep , i'd wake up .
why are you so scared , daddy?
what do i do?
it takes a year , nephew a full turn ofthe calendar , to get over losing someone .
that's a true sayin '.
the move'll help .
you'll see .
what place on earth could be better than ... the place your people came from?
smell that clean northern sea?
i'm not a water person .
at least the girl is .
i hope we're doing the right thing , aunt .
i thought i'd never come back here .
but the older you get there's an ache , a pull ... something you've got to figure out .
like you're a piece in a puzzle .
it takes some time to get used to the rock 'neath you .
it's a place like no other .
the people who came here came by accident .
those that stayed learned strange things can happen omens and restless spirits ... magic .
we quoyles , we left it 50 year ago .
hard times .
we're nearly there .
quoyle point .
named after us .
you .
well , i don't understand .
it's may , there's so much snow .
up here , forget everything you thought you knew about the weather .
i was born in that house .
empty 44 years
look at that roofline .
straight as a ruler .
look .
i wonder who that is .
it's your grandfather , sian quoyle .
died before i was born .
died young 12 year old .
twelve?
then he couldn't have been my grandfather .
you don't know newfoundlanders .
who's this?
it's my father and ... and you .
i never did care for that hat .
oh !
my lord , the table !
the blessed table !
there's no way we can live here .
it's all fixable .
we'll get a carpenter .
oh , well , it might be cheaper if we just build a whole new house on the riviera .
only i wasn't born on the riviera .
daddy?
what?
why did you wake me up?
i wanted to see if you were asleep .
are these cables so the house won't blow away?
so far so good .
they say it rocked in storms like a big rocking chair .
made the women sick , so they lashed it down .
they're moaning .
the house is sad .
what?
you should let it loose .
i'm here to apply for a job .
come on in .
listen here ...
listen here , my son .
i'm going to need clarification on this .
i got doris koontz down as runner up in " cakes and muffins " but her entry is listed as " strawberry rhubarb cobbler " which i believe ought to be under " pies .
name's tert card managing editor , rewrite man , and snow shoveller .
you'll have to do without the boss .
himself , jack buggit , has called in sick , as per usual .
which is why i am occupying his office , billy pretty and no bones about it .
come in .
name?
uh , quoyle .
i just got here yesterday from new york ...
ah , you're a quoyle , are you?
well , i should've seen that right off .
sit down .
prior experience as a journalist?
washington post?
london times?
oh , oh , no , i'm not a journalist .
i'm an ink setter .
i had that position ...
gammy bird .
are you in my office , tert?
no , no , no , jack .
i'm just conducting a job interview here at my desk .
job interview?
yeah , there's a mr. quoyle here .
says he's an ink setter .
the fella's a quoyle , you say?
and no mistake .
hmm .
have him meet me at the dock in , uh one hour .
that bronchitis of yours cleared up already?
much better .
thanks for your concern .
okay , jack .
quoyle !
over here .
step lively .
uh ... hello there , mr. buggit .
the man at the ...
the name's jack .
come on , get in .
i'm not a water person .
all quoyles is water people .
boats is in your blood .
that's why i'm hiring you .
i need somebody to cover the shipping news .
you'll get a list from the harbormaster what ships go in to killick claw ...
but , mr. buggit , i i i'm an ink setter .
pay attention , me old son .
i don't need no ink setter , i need a reporter .
and you'll do local car wrecks .
take the picture , write the story .
we run a front page photo of a car wreck every week whether or not we actually have a car wreck .
now , there's a knack for taking photos that make you feel something .
if there's a dark patch on the ground it reads blood whether it's motor oil or diet coke .
and you want something human , uh a child's mitten , a purse a baseball cap lying in the road .
see , that's what makes it human .
that's what makes the reader feel .
jack , i'm , i'm no reporter .
jesus sweet christ .
you think any of them tomcods knew how to write when i hired them?
i get a feeling about people that's all .
welcome home , guy .
i can't do it .
i mean , even if i knew the first thing about writing , which i don't , i ...
car crashes i can't cover those .
why not?
you know why not .
we face up to the things we're afraid of because we can't go around them .
car wrecks are a fact of life up here .
come winter , a drive into town'll be damn near impossible .
we'll buy us a boat .
look , i already told you , i'm not a water person .
they dragged it here .
what , honey?
the house .
they dragged it here .
you must've had a dream , sweetheart .
who told you about that?
a long time ago , on gaze island the old quoyles couldn't make a go of it there so they lashed the house with ropes and they dragged it .
yeah , they dragged it .
across the ice , clear to the mainland .
right here .
this is from the " news of your neighbors " column .
the pole on the corner of main and west streets
has a sign on it that says
it's illegal to place anything on that pole .
we see the postman has landed in the clink
for throwing the mail in killick claw harbor .
he said he had too much to deliver
and the folks could just take a dip and help themselves .
guess it helps if you can swim .
this is professional stuff .
how am i supposed to write this?
you can't .
you'll get it wrong .
here now , miss !
don't you talk to your father like that !
course he can do it .
petal says dad never gets anything right .
yeah , well , it'll work out .
hello .
you must be quoyle .
b. beaufield nutbeem .
i head up the foreign news department .
steals every story off that goddamn shortwave .
which tert takes the liberty of rewriting in his own mystical tongue .
only to save you from charges of plagiarism , nutbeem .
ah , mr. billy pretty an old fish dog and local landmark .
edits the home news page poems , baby photos , household tips .
there's your desk , quoyle .
is there , um , a computer?
well , do you see one?
no , i just ...
i see everyone else ...
keen powers of observation .
i can see why jack snatched you off the job market .
gammy bird .
uh huh .
right on to it .
well , quoyle , you lead a charmed life .
two minutes on the job and you got your first car wreck .
as far as i can tell , the site is really fresh about 10 , 15 minutes , uh , at the most .
you got two victims one male , one female .
not one vital sign between them so we're gonna wait till the police come now .
uh , the rate of speed we estimate at 65 so there's nothing unlawful here .
there's not a whole lot you can do , right when a moose decides to get in your way .
that's for sure .
uh ... the driver most likely had his chest crushed before the car hit the water , so at least that's a mercy .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah .
yeah .
well , there's that , and the and the moose you know , which is a gift really when you think about it out of season
like that a moose that size .
oh , lord , yes .
billy , i suppose we could split it four ways , right?
how much could you fit in the station wagon there?
i'll take the hind quarter .
i know we're gonna want to use some of those recipes from the " home page , " you know?
yeah , yeah , yeah .
he's new , is he?
new fella .
there you go .
it's wrecks like that that sells papers .
oh , jack knows his readers .
now , mind you , there's more people down under these waters than are killed on the roads .
you'll want to get yourself a nice little boat before long .
something that fits the water .
i just don't want to think about a boat right ...
wh who's that?
why?
oh , i ...
i was just curious .
i've seen her around .
she's very tall .
i ...
i mean she ... she's got good posture .
she seems very ... her stride is different .
it was grief that caused her boy to be not right .
she was carrying him when her husband was drowned at sea .
like i was saying , there's more life
lost that way .
how's your car wreck coming , quoyle?
if i wanted war and peace
i would have hired william bloody shakespeare .
the policeman ate breakfast at the codcake diner before he arrived at the accident scene "?
yes?
your spelling is fine and i've seen plenty worse grammar .
but but finding the center of your story the beating heart of it that's what makes a reporter .
now , you'll have to start by making up some headlines .
you know?
short , punchy , dramatic headlines .
now , have a look .
what do you see?
tell me the headline .
horizon fills with dark clouds .
imminent storm threatens village .
but what if no storm comes?
village spared from deadly storm .
how was your first day?
what's all this?
nephew , we can't fix up the house proper on a journalist's wages , so i've un retired .
from what?
boat upholstery .
all us quoyles have a feeling for boats .
who who's this?
that's dennis buggit , master carpenter .
ah , only till i gets me lobster license .
i'm a fisherman in me soul .
buggit , huh?
you you wouldn't be related to my boss down at the gammy bird?
mm hmm .
yeah , yeah .
my dad .
tomorrow i'll run two by fours under your second story .
oh , and , uh , i was you
i wouldn't sleep in your upstairs tonight unless you want to wake up downstairs with a thud .
yeah .
yes , boy .
what?
what?
what is it?
what is it?
a ghost .
the window .
a skinny ghost , and a white dog .
i i didn't dream it .
don't say i did .
i won't , i won't , sweetheart , okay .
there's a ghost there ...
okay , okay , shh , okay .
okay , shh ...
okay ...
okay .
shh .
oh , excuse me?
this is our first day at school .
i don't like these kids .
bunny .
um , she's in the after school  they're boring !
boring , boring , boring !
bunny , that's enough .
i'm sorry .
she's she's not usually like this .
not usually like what?
i hate going to new places where i don't know anybody .
i don't know anybody .
what's wrong with him?
bunny , that is ...
there is nothing wrong with him , all right?
this is herry .
when he was being born he didn't get enough air to breathe and that makes him a little slower than most people .
what's your name?
bunny .
a bunny rabbit .
that's what my mother calls me .
is mommy at work now?
no , she's asleep with the angels .
i am a bunny rabbit .
oh , you certainly are .
boing , boing , boing , boing ...
whi which of those women are in charge here?
neither of them .
they're just moms .
oh , 'cause somebody really ought to be paying more attention to them .
i mean , look at that .
there's scissors on the ground .
i mean , somebody really ought to be supervising them , don't you think?
yeah .
better get back to work .
supervising and all .
i'm wavey prowse .
i run the place .
they are having entirely too much fun aren't they?
it's a constant problem around here .
bumbling dad
humiliated at day care .
quoyle !
c'mon over , quoyle !
order's up now .
come and get it .
aye , sir .
hey .
hmm .
you've been to the harbormaster's .
yeah , boats in , boats out .
not exactly the stuff of legends .
sometimes there's a story behind the story .
what can i do you for then?
oh , um , i'll have , uh , what whatever they're having .
what are you having?
squid burger .
it's good .
all right , then .
you want some fries with that?
okay .
all right , then , be back .
have you got yourself a boat yet , quoyle?
no .
you ought to get alvin yark to build you one .
or you could buy nutbeem's .
i built a chinese junk .
sailed it up from brazil .
unfortunately , i missed manhattan by a mile or two and got stranded here when i shipwrecked by gaze island .
i've almost finished my repairs .
i'll be sailing away soon .
she's ugly , and ... the only thing i've ever loved .
eh , your story tugs at me bladder .
excuse me .
um , what is it between those two?
first thing : you'll have to understand about the curse .
jack buggit's father , his grandfather his great grandfather all died at sea .
jack is ... sensitive .
especially about the sea .
sensitive .
it's what they call people around here who , um , " know " things .
so , dennis is forbidden the sea .
but being free
newfie and 21 , he goes , anyway .
what?
and that's enough ...?
death storm .
a massive wave cracks her steel hull amidships a one inch crack from starboard to port .
men go in the water .
dennis is lost .
after about a week they come to jack and tell him the search is to be called off .
jack stands like a stone .
then he turns quick , the way he does and says ...
he's alive ... and i know where .
so , off he goes , out to sea on his own , in just a skiff and finds dennis .
can you imagine the odds?
finds him .
finds him .
both arms broken , 99 % dead .
the boy comes to .
and jack says to him , " if you ever step foot in a boat again , i'll drown you myself .
and do you know what dennis said?
say it fast .
he said ...
all fishing licenses are spoken for .
i'd appreciate it if you gave me yours .
jack looked in his eyes and they never spoke again .
quoyle ... you got the " shipping news " written up yet?
oh , yes .
there's nothing here .
boats in , boats out .
what else is there?
if i knew , i'd write it myself .
i took a chance on you , quoyle .
don't let me down .
go get the aspirin now !
oh , shut up !
i had as much to drink last night as you did !
excuse me .
do i know you?
i'm a ...
i i work for the local paper .
i do the the " shipping news .
i was just ...
is this your boat?
that's a boat .
this is a botterjacht .
she was built for hitler .
he was the original owner .
really?
i i just wanted to ask you a a couple of questions .
the finest botterjacht ever built in holland .
tell him what happened in hurricane bob .
and she's incredibly heavy .
40 tons of solid oak .
tell him !
she broke free of her moorings and pounded six boats expensive ones to rubble .
wham !
now tell him who let our insurance lapse .
wham !
oh , it took six very expensive lawyers to weasel us out of it .
jesus !
an inch from bankruptcy .
moral of the story?
when you marry a tour guide confine his authority to mixing the drinks .
did i come at a bad time?
yeah .
ten years ago would've been better .
wife fires artillery on hitler's boat .
hello .
hi .
hi .
you guys need a ride?
thanks , but , uh , herry likes to walk .
oh .
well , it's a nice day for a walk .
mr. quoyle ...
about the other day?
i'm sorry we got off on the wrong foot .
no , that's , that's all right .
i i was way off base .
i i admire anybody that works with kids .
that's the hardest job in the world , you know?
i'm i'm a journalist , myself .
really?
have you seen our local paper?
strictly fish wrap .
what?
i'm the new reporter there .
oy ... uh ... oh ... no , i'm i'm sure ... that'll be , uh ...
good luck to you .
oh , thank you very much .
it was nice to see you again .

someone that you're missing .
six year ago today .
leukemia .
we weren't married but that's a technicality .
that your boat?
yeah , i just bought her .
one question remains : why?
well , she's a speedboat .
it's a shit boat .
wallowing , cockeyed bastard .
it'll sink in a bathtub .
makes you cry to look at her .
just a coffin , boy .
let me know when you're serious .
i'll take you down to see
alvin yark .
he'll make you up a sweet little rodney .
you don't have the sense god gave a doughnut , do you?
i'm going home .
the best you can do is bury it some dark night .
what in hell a name's this?
hitler's barge .
uh , that's , uh , a vessel in port .
it goes with the " shipping news .
so , what about the motorcycle accident?
oh , i'm still working on that but i think this is a better story .
what do you mean?
you didn't do the one that jack wanted you to do?
you did one that he don't know you did?
well , this is worse than your boat .
jack even sniffs this he'll cut you up for lobster bait .
i think i'll run it .
... and he crawled off the grass onto a branch and he made a cocoon , which is like a house except it's for a caterpillar ...
hey , bunny .

he thinks i know how .
oh , oh ... no , no ...
go on , get the pig .

so , listen here , me old son , i'm giving you a weekly column .

i i i don't know what to say .
did i not tell you?
my name is jack .
jack .
ibm , please .
get back to your work , quoyle .
i ...
b ...
m.
lumbering idiot stuns crowd ... for a change .
herry prowse !
look how well your kite is doing .
are you making it dance with your thoughts?
your kite is doing so much better than mr. quoyle's .
do you think bunny's strange
i mean , mentally?
the skinny ghost with the white dog?
she told you about that?
maybe she's sensitive .
the way some folks are around here .
and what about the necklaces?
do you know how many of those she makes?
i mean ... and i found her bashing her baby doll's brains out with a hammer .
a baby doll doesn't have brains .
it's a toy .
do you know she's ... saving a room for her mother?
did she tell you that?
yeah .
is she strange , that's all?
is she okay?
if if you had to take a guess .
that little girl's the only friend my son ever had .
so she's strange , you bet .
it crashed !
all right .
there you go .
do you know how he died?
my husband?
it was a calm night when herold took the boat out .
there was no sign of any storm .
storms can be sudden around here .
he wasn't the only one whose boat went down .
it was four years ago ... and it's yesterday .
look how high we're up .
uh huh .
beat you to the car .
did i blow it or can you still be my friend?
your friend?
sure .
is this yours?
the ghost brought it .
then he ran away .
the skinny ghost with the white dog?
don't say i dreamt it .
ah , you're getting the hang of it .
now , coax her a wee bit to starboard .
attaboy .
you're a quoyle there's seawater in your veins .
how are things with your girl?
oh , bunny's just still adjusting , i think .
oh , i was talking about wavey prowse .
sorry ... sorry !
whoa !
jesus !
sorry .
i ...
wavey and i are just friends .
fine .
don't have to drown me over it .
this is where i grew up .
that's my poor old father there .
and that's where your house stood .
before they dragged it across the ice .
yes , sir .
before they was driven away .
driven away by what?
you never knew?
ah , well .
it's neither here nor there , right?
the point is , they made a new place for theirselves .
no , by what?
driven away by what?
oh , that's old stuff , boy .
it's in my blood .
you ought to be able to tell me .
well , they come to gaze island centuries ago , they did .
the old quoyles was rackers .
they were , they were pirates , sort of like .
you see them cairns?
fires used to burn in them to guide the ships at sea , like lighthouses .
now , the quoyles would move the fires to fool the ships .
they'd lure them into the rocks so the quoyles could grab their loot .
oh , they was a savage lot , the old quoyles .
then they went too far one day , they ... nailed a man to a tree and they cut off his nose to draw the nippers and the flies that that ate him alive .
and that's when the quoyles was given their walking papers .
jesus .
now , there's still an old quoyle down in one of these coves somewhere .
they say he slept with his wife after she was dead .
anything else i should know?
that about covers it .
when the knitting pins , you is abreast
hold the tiller to the west ...
behind the pins you must steer ... [ m ]
till the old man's shoe ... does appear .
pull , pull !
show me that necklace .
see , if you make the loops bigger you don't have to make so many .
okay .
good morning .
can i talk to you for a minute?
where's that chair from?
excuse me?
the chair that you're sitting in .
where's it from ; where'd you get it?
it's not from around here , right?
it's foreign , it's exotic .
i don't want pirate's loot in this home .
billy pretty told me all about it .
it's a good thing somebody finally did .
i don't believe in dwelling in the past .
no?
then what are we doing here?
making a future .
well , well , well if it ain't the second coming of the quoyles .
taking a long and hearty meal break
i can't help but noticing .
hope you've got a good idea for your next story , quoyle .
i'd hate for jack to think that it was just beginner's luck .
let the man digest , tert .
mind you , if i was the esteemed author of the " shipping news " column
i'd pick up the mcgonigle oil field story .
petro dollars ; a golden flood of jobs .
you write a story about that
i'll put it right there on the front page .
thank you for stopping by , tert .
yeah , thanks , tert .
aw , gee ...
what was that all about?
oh , uh , he owns mobil oil .
ten shares .
what about your column?
what about it?
you said you'd read it to me .
yeah , i will , once the game is done .
there's a 1904 photo hung in the killick claw library ...
eight schooners heading out to the fishing grounds
their sails are white and beautiful .
but nowadays you're just as likely to see
a big black shape of an oil tanker
like the ruptured golden goose .
last week it leaked 14, 000 tons of crude
onto the seabirds , fish and boats at cape despot .
there will be more and more tankers .
they will get old and corroded and their tanks will split .
and there will be less fish , and less fishermen .
nobody hangs a picture of an oil tanker on their wall , do they?
what do you think?
i think when tert card sees it , he'll stay up nights thinking of cheap shots to pay you back .
i think he won't stop until you're fired .
i think i haven't been so proud of a friend ... since i don't know when .
uh , what do you think?
pretty impressive , huh?
like i said , nobody hangs one of those .
well ... your column's front page stuff .
only now it's more a caption , is all .
more than 3, 000 tankers proudly ride ... the world's seas .
even the biggest take advantage of newfoundland's deep water ports and refineries .
spelled it all perfect so as not to embarrass you .
oil and newfoundland go together
like ham and eggs and like ham and eggs , they'll nourish us in the coming years .
even put your name on it .
let's all hang a picture of an oil tanker on our wall .
man of your principles ...
i understand the only honorable course is resignation .
and if you're off to see jack buggit you're going to have to swim .
for i runs the gammy bird , every inch of it which he'd have to do without me .
and if you think he's going to choose you over fishing then you're dumber than a doughnut .
if that's possible .
jack?
for christ sakes , quoyle cut your motor !
all right , what's the emergency?
can't it wait till i'm done fishing?
it's about my column .
card , he printed it not the way i wrote it .
well , so?
you disapprove how card runs my newspaper enough to lose your job?
yes or no?
yes .
so , this is what jack and i think : we want to run quoyle's wrong headed oil spills story because controversy sells papers and papers sells ads .
but the oil tanker picture stays .
you should have seen tert's face .
yeah?
oh , it was a beautiful thing .
that's all right , i've seen it .
oh , it's great .
mm hmm .
let's see what the special is .
how do you feel about ordering to go?
you ever had that before?
no , what is it?
seal flipper pie .
yeah , it's made from , like the knuckle part of the flipper .
the slimy cartilage part .
yeah , it's good , though .
i mean , it's a good choice if you like that sort of thing .
i ... you know , i'm really not all that hungry .
i just wanted , you know , to come and sit .
i had a big lunch today .
yeah .
they say you're not a real newfoundlander till you've had a piece of seal flipper pie .
that's what they say?
yeah , that's right .
mmm , good .
that's surprising .
i never eat it , myself .
you never eat this?
this is horrible .
here , i got you some real food look .
christ .
i knew somebody was out here .
oh , for christ's sake .
he's still burning off the fever .
any feeling yet?
little tingles .
you're lucky .
i'm fine .
i'll be ready to get right back in that water in another 20 , 30 years .
do you know how close you were to dying?
i'll get my uncle , alvin yark , to build you a proper boat and learn how to use it , okay?
okay .
good .
were the eyes open or closed?
i don't know .
just said it was an disembodied head .
what'd the police have to say about it?
still working on it .
a little late to return the head to its owner , though .
hello , nephew .
mrs. silver melville was arrested early today
in lanai , hawaii , for the murder of her husband socialite and raconteur mr. bayonet melville .
'he pushed me once too often , 'mrs. melville confessed
'so i finally pushed back . " '
good for you , my dear .
well , he probably deserved it .
hey .
hey .
don't get your hopes up .
you're the first man who ever cooked for me .
you got a lot of leeway .
how are they?
they're both asleep in bunny's bed .
should we trust them?
i can do this .
you just don't think ...
oh , no .
no , i know .
here ...
let me do that , all right?
there you go .
can you feel that ...
yeah . through your bandage?
what?
your husband , he never ... he never cooked you a meal?
why are we talking about my husband?
because i understand .
you said " it's four years ago and it's yesterday .
i understand that .
my husband's not who we're talking about , right?
i'll go get herry .
he wouldn't like waking up in a strange bed .
hey !
huh? !
who are you?
i tied magic in these knots to protect you from the house .
no good ever come from the old place .
never , never ... never .
you ... you have no ... business in the quoyle house .
i get you out of there .
but i am a quoyle .
a quoyle? !
i was a quoyle before you was anything .
leave the house .
tell , uh ...
agnis hello from ...
cousin nolan .
you know why agnis come back?
to show she ain't afraid of the place no more .
'cause i know what she's done .
i know .
she got rid of the baby she was carrying .
what could she do?
what?
she was only 12 and it was her own brother that done it to her .
no ...
no !
no !
no !
please !
no !
no !
please !
does that belong to you?
sorry .
there's still hot water in the kettle if you want some tea .
i've started looking for a place for me and bunny .
you sure you're going to be okay at your shop?
i said i would , didn't i?
i think silver melville was right to chop her husband's head off .
he probably deserved it .
i think more women should do what she did .
maybe some should have done it to their own brother ...
my father .
cousin nolan dropped by last night .
i always thought if anyone knew , i'd be turned to stone .
shit !
here .
tea's a good drink .
it'll keep you going .
when someone hurts you that much ... how do you ...?
does it ever go away?
is it possible?
her name was irene .
the love of my life .
you look happy .
so , yeah , it is possible .
agnis tells me we got to move for the winter .
it'll be a three hour drive from here to the point .
all the ice ...
me and bunny , we're going to have to find a room in town somewhere .
i'll have the usual , please , annie .
thank you .
well , if it's a place to stay you need you can have my trailer .
timing's perfect .
what are you talking about?
my boat's ready .
if i stay here any longer
i might begin to like the place .
i'm throwing myself a farewell party on saturday .
departure to follow sunday .
the rootless traitor .
regrets soon after , no doubt .
quoyle of the north !
quoyle of the north .
have you and wavey done the dirty yet?
shh !
she's the grieving widow .
grieving for herold prowse .
oh , that's a good one .
let me tell you something about old herold prowse .
it's like a party game in town to look at babies and see if they look like herold .
hey ...
hey !
everyone !
to nutbeem !
to nutbeem !
we all loves our fucking nutbeem , huh? !
lets us keep him here then !
got your chainsaw , neddie?
nutbeem !
hoh oh oh !
what's wrong?
i'm a quoyle .
i'm one of the quoyles pirates and looters and murderers .
my father raped his little sister and then he taught me how to swim .
stop that .
jesus , you smell like a brewery .
stop it .
go on , herry .
go on .
stop it !
herry .
sorry , herry .
i'm sorry , petal .
i'm so sorry .
i meant wavey .
good .
i feel much better .
when were you going to tell me about your fucked up marriage?
i'm scrambling eggs .
are you going to be able to eat?
no .
listen , i'm ...
maybe i should just go .
you forget where the door is?
he ran off to winnipeg with some little bitch .
she was barely out of high school .
is that fucked up enough for you?
herold ... my husband , he didn't die .
not that he didn't deserve to .
he left me when i was eight months pregnant ; no good to him in bed .
so i took his 15 footer out into the bay cracked the hull with a hatchet and sunk her and pretended he was drowned and played the grieving widow and packed my bags to leave town .
but then a funny thing happened .
all these folk i grew up with they put their hearts around me and herry so we wouldn't be alone .
and i just couldn't leave .
i'm sorry , wavey .
you're always sorry .
you're looking dishy , quoyle .
i'm afraid my offer to let you stay in my trailer will have to be retracted .
sorry about that .
and your boat .
i'm some disgusted with the human race .
i never would have made it anyway .
storms would have blown me to bits .
you boys saved my life , i imagine .
i've gathered up my savings , and i'm flying back to brazil where the water is swimming pool green .
you and bunny can stay with the wife and me .
to brazil .
brazil .
brazil .
brazil .
we can stay with aunt agnis over at her shop .
barely enough room there for myself .
you'll like it at dennis 'house , sweetie .
no , i won't .
hi , quoyle .
hi , bunny .
welcome , weary travelers .
our home's your home .
no , it's not .
come on in .

i made a big seal flipper pie .
what's that?
weather light .
storm coming .
big one .
the house ... the house ... house ...
i ...
what is it , quoyle?
what?
it's gone .

the green house is gone .
i didn't dream it .
don't say i did .
yeah?
oh , hi , mom .
some storm , eh?
what?
oh .
yes .
yes , of course .
what's a wake?
it's to say good bye .
mr. buggit is sleeping with the angels .
he was a hard man , but he was fair .
another one for the buggit curse .
dennis ...
yeah , i'm still looking for my dad's navy medal .
i found it .
don't you worry .
it's going to be all right .
thank you .
mom .
what?
good ...
i found it ... in his desk at the office .
would you write something for the gammy bird about jack?
yes , i'll try .
jack is ...
jack is all right now .
you all know ... we are only passing by .
we walk over these stones a few times .
our boats ... sail for a little while on the waves and then they have to sink .
jack knew that better than anyone .
right , jack?
yes , boy .
he's awake !
jack ...
get a doctor !
oh , jack ... oh , jack ...
oh , jack ...
no , no ...
come here , son .
i beat the curse .
the fishing license is yours .
sweetheart , you ready?
i want to have a wake for petal .
why didn't we have a wake?
why didn't we wake her up?
it worked for him .
honey , mr. buggit wasn't really ...
it's more like he was in a coma .
from the cold water .
it's like he was sleeping .
petal was asleep .
no , honey ...
you said she was asleep with the angels .
i know .
honey , i know what i said , honey .
you said !
you said !
i know , but she's not sleeping .
you said !
you said !
honey , honey , listen to me .
you said !
i know what i said .
listen to me .
listen to me .
i just ...
i was too scared to tell you the truth .
petal is dead .
and you know that .
i know you know it .
it's okay .
is it because of me?
what?
that she drove away .
well , why would you say that?
because ... because i'm boring .
oh ...
no , honey , it's not because of you .
and you are anything but boring .
come here .
you just come here .
hon ...
you believe me , don't you?
you still don't believe me , do you?
about the house .
i told you so .
it's all right .
worse things have happened .
to both of us .
maybe one day we'll build a summerhouse out here .
summer ...
do they have summer here?
oh , you'll know it's summer when the partridge berries are out .
and we can make partridge berry duff and sweet berry okie .
will you show me how?
i will , yeah .
i will .
there are still so many things i don't know .
if a piece ofknotted string can unleash the wind and if a drowned man can awaken ... then i believe a broken man can heal .
deadly storm takes house .
leaves ...
excellent view .
