new year's eve , 1999 .
it's being called the party of the century ... but it may be the biggest ever .
no one's seen preparations like this ... but preparations require care and insurance ... and the lapd is one insurance company ... that doesn't want accidents .
put you on a reservation
black nation
die underyour step and fetch a military lie
the bodies of two men found under the hollywood freeway ... have been identified as rap starjeriko one ... and band memberjames polton , known to fans as replay .
both were shot in what police are characterizing ... as an execution style killing .
the body of an unidentified woman ... was found with them , also shot numerous times .
police said the killings appearto be gang related .
with his band , prophets of light ...
jeriko one's outspoken political stance and violent lyrics ... have stirred nationwide controversy .
meanwhile , astrologers have been busy ... making predictions for the coming century .
some of their fortune telling is indeed incredible
muammar qaddafi will be awarded the nobel peace prize .
turkey will make reparations to armenia .
by 2025, there will be a second woman president ...
hey , lenny .
how ya doin ', man?
hey , man .
keith .
keith?
yeah .
hi .
lenny .
lenny nero .
we spoke on the phone .
hi .
ok .
not to be rude , but i gotta ask .
are you a cop?
i understand .
no , i'm not .
you understand .
attorney , right?
that's right .
tassel shoes .
entertainment law would be my guess .
it's my job to know people and what they want ... what's behind their eyes .
ok , so tell me , have you everjacked in?
have you everwire tripped?
no .
a virgin brain .
we're gonna start you off right .
just save us some time , tell me what you know .
just what i've read .
that the technology was developed for the feds ... to replace the body wire , and now it's gone black market .
that's right , so ... this conversation's not taking place , ok?
damn right it's not .
good .
do i get the deck from you?
i'll get you a deck at my cost .
my thing is the software .
clips , right?
clips .
right .
listen , i want you to know what we're talking about here .
this is not " like tv , only better .
this is life .
it's a piece of somebody's life .
it's pure and uncut , straight from the cerebral cortex .
you're there .
you're doing it .
you're seeing it , hearing it .
you're feeling it .
you're feeling it .
what kind of things , exactly?
anything .
whatever you want , whoever you wanna be .
want to go skiing without leaving your den, you can ... but i'm assuming that a guy like you ... you want to ski , you fly to aspen .
that's not what you're interested in .
it's ...
it's about the stuff that you can't have , right?
the forbidden fruit , hmm?
running into a liquor store with a . 357 magnum in your hand ... feeling the adrenaline pumping through yourveins , huh?
or see that guy with the drop dead filipino girlfriend?
wouldn'tyou like to be that guy fortwenty minutes?
the right twenty minutes .
i can make it happen ... and you won't even tarnish your wedding ring .
sounds good .
i can get you what you want .
i can get you anything .
just talk to me .
you have to trust me , ok?
'cause i'm your priest .
i'm your shrink .
i am your main connection to the switch board of souls .
i'm the magic man .
the santa claus of the subconscious .
you say it , you think it, you can have it .
you want a girl?
you want two girls?
i don't know what your thing is , what you're curious about .
you want a guy?
maybe you want to be a girl .
hey, think of that .
be a girl .
see what that feels like .
maybe you want a nun to tie you up .
it's all doable .
talk to me about costs .
before we get into numbers , i want you to try a taste .
i got a deck with me .
right here?
step into my office .
ohh .
ohh .
ahh .
ooh .
you were just an 18 year old girl taking a shower .
are you beginning to see the possibilities here?
hey .
so, where is he?
in the back making a deal .
oh .
nexttime , let's meet someplace less public .
nervous?
don't be .
cops have more to worry about than the squld trade .
oh, yeah?
assume the position , you miserable techno perv puke .
beat it, fuckwad !
uhh !
max , i was with a client !
you think that'sfunny?
prick .
see the look on that preppy puke'sface?
pissed all over his topsiders .
it was funny , but it cost me money .
come on , amigo .
the world'sfull of marks .
no one knows how to work them like you do , pal .
you could sell a rat's asshole for a wedding ring .
yeah , i could .
let me buy you a drink .
bobby !
bobby !
tequila , porfavor .
double shots .
make it a tres generaciones .
nothing but the best for lenny ... the finest cop to ever get thrown off the vice squad .
fuck you .
ha ha ha !
whoo .
yeah , nice tie .
thanks , max .
you always got to dress like a fucking pimp?
this tie cost more than your entire wardrobe .
that's not saying much .
it's the one thing ... that stands between me and the fucking jungle .
to the jungle ... where some shit bird can cap you in the head ... and that'll ruin your whole day .
you were lucky , max .
so darned lucky , i wake up with a twenty two in my brainpan ... and a cop pension i can't live off of .
damn !
it's a good thing i wasn't luckier .
bobby , hit me again .
you seen faith lately?
she won't call me .
just as well .
sure , faith was the most outstanding woman ... a guy like you could ever hope to get ... and it's completely humiliating that she's gone ... but you got to face that it's over .
thanks , chaplain .
i'm touched by your concern .
i just hate to see you pining away , man .
you're myfriend .
it makes me want to vomit .
hey , lris .
you ok?
i gotta talk to you .
it's serious .
what happened , honey?
some john get rough on you?
no .
i mean, talk private .
please?
i'm in trouble .
so is faith .
there's the magic fucking word .
can you come with me to your car , please?
there's something you have to see .
what's going on?
it's a bad situation .
what?
if they get me , i know they'll ...
who?
oh , shit .
hey !
hang on !
that's my car !
not anymore .
it belongs to the bank .
wait a second .
whoops .
great .
two million years of human evolution ... that's the best idea you can come upwith .
what do you getto repo a car?
two hundred?
two fifty?
i'll pay you three fifty right now .
got the cash on you?
i was gonna write a check .
see ya .
i totally respect that .
i would want cash .
they'll take my check inside .
just give me two minutes .
here .
you can keep my watch for collateral .
it's a rolex .
i'll be right back .
two minutes .
two minutes?
son of a bitch .
what happened to your car this time?
see , lenny , if you packed your piece ... you could make the guy see sense .
bobby, turn this up .
you watch us take it all
and then you'll understand our pain
we'll make you the rat
that crawled through the cracks
you love that red, white , and blue
but you hate the black , black , black
and you tryin 'to make me think
i did this to myself
when the drugs i smoke
and the guns i tote
both came from your shelf
but i never had a dream , 'cause
my life is a nightmare
america's been my boogieman
for four hundred years
are you asking me how i feel?
we felt jeriko .
we listened to him .
the lapd is a military force ... turned against its own people .
we live in a police state ...
hey , macey .
shh . ... with their social programs that don'twork .
they're rearranging deck chairs on the titanic .
but a new day is coming .
two k is coming .
the day of reckoning is upon us .
history ... ends and begins again ... right here ... right now !
right on !
to the end of all things .
you know how i know it's the end of the world?
no .
tell me .
'cause everything's already been done, you know?
every kind of music's been tried ... every government's been tried , every fucking hairstyle ... bubble gum flavors , cereal , every type of fucking .
what are we going to do?
how are we going to make another thousand years?
i'm telling you , it's over .
we used it all up .
what's this week's sad story?
they jerked my wheels .
it's outrageous the computer errors the banks make .
have you noticed?
no , i haven't , because i make my payments .
so , max peltier , how's the p. i. business?
sucks .
but when i get this new logo
i want to hear this scumbag .
do you have any leads?
why wasn't jeriko one provided adequate security?
he always had adequate security available to him .
he chose not to have those encumbrances in his life .
why's he a scumbag?
you know who left lenny for him .
faith left lenny for him?
don't say faith .
use the " f " word around lenny , it triggers a maudlin display ... and you gotta tranquilize him .
shh .
i've lost afriend , a man of great courage ... which is more than i can say for most of us .
if you're riding  let's go .
fuck you, you pig !
driving mr. lenny .
it's going to be a big night .
can't you feel it?
the energy in the air .
there's money to be made , dreams to sell .
sleaze to peddle .
that is so unenlightened .
i sell experiences .
the way i see it , i'm performing a humanitarian service .
i probably save lives .
i wanna hear this part .
everybody needs to walk to the dark end of the street .
it's what we are .
now the risks are out of line .
the streets are a war zone .
sex can kill you .
you slip on the 'trodes and get what you need ... almost as good as the real thing and a lot safer .
porno .
face it , you sell porno to wireheads .
harsh and untrue .
my clients are professionals .
they're people with taste .
some are even celebrities .
what celebrities?
the guy from the news .
he does the weather .
that counts .
you passed la cienega .
i'm not taking it .
it's the quickestway to the club .
i've got business there .
i'm meeting people .
mace, you're myfriend .
plus i'll give you twenty five percent of what i make tonight .
this may be a hard concept for you ... but friends don't have to pay their friends .
faith is singing .
i should have known .
look ...
i pulled twelve hours .
i gotta get some sleep .
i got one last pickup at the st. james club .
they got a taxi stand .
you can catch a cab .
a taxi?
well , someone might see me .
hold it right there , ma'am .
whoa .
hold it right there .
damn it , lenny , you made me late .
what's your pickup's name?
i'll find him .
fumitsu .
fumitsu?
fumitsu .
fumitsu .
you can leave the car right there .
oh, fuck .
nero .
strickland .
commissioner strickland .
since you shit canned my career , i don't have to call you " sir .
it's one of life's small pleasures .
aren't you peddling a little far from your usual gutter?
i was invited here by a close friend mr. fumitsu .
he's right over there .
i don't like disappointments , nero .
you know what disappoints me very much?
your sex life?
excuse me .
mr. fumitsu .
leonard nero , bls limousine and security service .
i've arranged for one of our finest drivers ...
lornette mason , to take care of you .
she's a security specialist trained in defensive combat .
of course, the car's bullet proof and fully armored .
i'll be coming along to complete our periodic driver evaluation .
with your permission , of course .
we do it to ensure that our vlp clients ... are always treated as honored guests .
good evening , mr. fumitsu .
sir , please watch your head .
excuse me , mr. nero .
excuse me , sir !
what the fuck are you doing?
coming with you .
you will not live to see the morning .
drive on .
are you a cop?
no .
good .
have you ever been wired?
wired?
the latest technology .
oh .
that is so beautiful .
you got to take a look at this , ok?
yeah .
you're going to love it .
you have more?
i have more .
believe me , i have more .
ha ha ha .
hey !
careful on the jacket .
it's armani .
are you angry?
i told you no wirehead shit in my car .
you're on foot !
in l. a.?
are you crazy?
can i come in?
i'm having a hard time hearing the stereo !
i need my case .
it's still in the back .
can we talk a little bit like two rational adults?
can we talk a little bit like two rational adults?
uhh !
that'd be no .
ok, you got my attention .
this is cutting off the circulation to my head .
do you mind?
macey .
it's cool .
it's nothing .
two seconds .
this is uncharacteristic , miss ice water in her veins .
you push me too far !
you made me lose it infront of a client !
i could get fired !
are we still friends?
i don't know .
friendship is more than one person ... constantly doing favors for an other .
i don't hustle my friends .
but you just suck people along with scams and your slick act .
we're still buddies?
don't use the time that i'm talking ... to think about what you'll say next .
you listening?
yeah .
lenny, your ass is always broke , you go from score to score ... and you're getting strung out .
you don't even see it .
it's your brain , so do whatever you want with it .
but not on my watch , you understand me?
i got a child , i got rent ... and an ex husband doing hard time ... who doesn't send me a dime of support .
i'm just trying to hold on here .
i know you wouldn't say this if you didn't care about me .
thanks , mace .
really .
you're getting out with fumitsu , and that's the end .
i'll get you to the templars in ten minutes .
i'm sorry for the inconvenience .
i'm changing my plans .
your supervisor has recommended an excellent club ... called the retinal fetish .
it's on la cienega .
yes , sir .
enjoy your evening , mr. fumitsu .
i appreciate it .
thank you .
ok , come on .
excuse us .
excuse us .
excuse us .
hi , lenny .
this is a friend of mine , mr. fumitsu .
can you take care of him?
he's clean .
he's fine .
could you take care of this gentleman?
thank you .
ok .
bye .
hey , lenny .
how ya doing?
who's the new side of beef in gant's posse?
wade beemer , running back for the rams , '96 , '97 .
like a fucking freighttrain .
rams .
that's football , right?
no , ping pong .
iris was looking for you !
hello , lenny .
it's ok, wade .
he's an old friend of mine .
lenny nero .
come to peddle me some clips for old time's sake ... or just making a few extra bucks for the holidays?
you're not a client anymore .
i wouldn't sell you the sweat off a dead dog's balls .
i've got everything i need from you .
thanks .
cut it out , philo .
too bad about your guy jeriko .
you've lost your golden goose .
show some respect .
he was an important artist .
important for your label , so you're in mourning .
his records will sell out now , and you'll make out .
always do .
faith , can i talk to you for one second?
it's not a good idea right now .
i just gotta talk to you for one second .
about what?
that'd be between me and faith .
funny , i don't feel anything between you and faith .
you see , that's your problem , lenny ... you assume too much .
you assume there's something where there's nothing .
you assume that you have a life ... when , infact, you peddle pieces of other people's lives ... and the broken parts of your own .
faith .
get him to his car .
call me , ok?
faith !
call me !
lenny the loser .
leave him alone , philo , ok?
you shouldn't talk to him or anybody ... not with everything that's going on .
you are too goddamn paranoid .
you know that , philo?
paranoia's just ... reality on afiner scale .
thank you .
awoo !
ow !
ow !
ow !
ow !
hey .
what's up, tex?
what's up , my brother?
those rascals still haven't grown back?
no .
any day now .
i just know it .
got something for you .
a present , something i had custom made .
happy millennium .
i got something for you, too .
just showed up tonight .
i don't know who from .
fan mail from some flounder?
mmm .
hi .
hi .
strange days not like before
i can hardly wait
i can hardly wait
i can hardly wait
i can hardly wait
it's been so long
i've lost my taste
say angel come
say lick my face
let fall your drapes
i'll play the part
i'll open this mouth wide
eat your heart
your heart
i can hardly wait
i can hardly wait
i can hardly wait
i can hardly wait
lips crack dry
tongue blue burst
say angel come

it's been so long
i've lost my taste
here , romeo
take my water brain
hi , baby .
i missed you .
lenny, you have to leave .
i mean it .
iris said you were in trouble .
you talked to lris?
when?
tonight .
i haven't seen her in months .
what the fuck would she know?
who knows what's going on in that whore's head?
she used to be your best friend .
you're really running out of excuses ... to come around , aren't you?
i know you , faith .
you're afraid of something .
what's going on?
just let it alone , lenny .
it'll take care of itself .
it's gant , isn't it?
this guy is poison .
he's got you walled in .
he uses the wire too much .
he gets off on tape , not on you .
that's a good one coming from you .
why don't you just split?
i don't want to .
do you love him?
i don't think so .
to him, you're some kind of possession .
you're like a ferrari .
you're just something to show the other guys .
yeah?
he has his uses, too, you know .
what?
he gonna record you on his label?
he might .
you never know , right?
faith ...
faith , listen to me .
i've watched you create yourself out of nothing .
you're like a goddamn cruise missile ... targeted on making it , and you will .
i know i will .
it's you up on that stage , not him .
you don't need him .
you have to get out of here .
if philo catches you , he's gonna hurt you .
i'm already hurting .
no , i'm serious .
he's acting crazy .
he's doing way too much playback .
he's gotten completely paranoid .
he's such a controlfreak now ... he's even paying max to follow me around .
max?
you're kidding .
yeah, for about a month now .
jesus .
look , lenny , just stay away from philo ... and stay away from me .
stop trying to rescue me .
those days are over .
i'm a big girl now .
i've changed .
stop trying to save me .
i don't need saving .
just give up on me !
i just wanted to make sure you were all right .
you know why movies are still better than playback?
'cause the music comes up , there's credits ... and you always know when it's over .
it's over !
you were great .
hey , man .
i know what you're thinking .
she told me about your new gig .
it's just a job .
i feel like shit about it .
you should feel like shit .
i do .
you introduced me to that prick gant .
i introduced him to faith, too .
i don't cherish the moment .
questionable move , given the historical perspective .
i figured i could take the prick's money you wouldn't believe what i'm charging him and make sure faith is ok atthe same time .
keep an eye on her .
for you , ok?
which you can't do ... without getting your fingers bent the wrong way back .
i need the money .
this does us both some good .
fairly twisted logic , max , even for you .
hey, you got a job .
i got a job .
ok .
i'm sorry .
you got a job .
that's great .
listen, you got to stay on her .
watch her for me , please .
i'm on her .
ok .
stay cool .
take it easy , all right?
you, too .
come on .
here , chicky , chicky , chicky ...
wait a minute .
i recognize you .
you're wade beemer , right?
running back for the rams , '96 , '97 , right?
yeah .
that's right .
i saw you play , man .
i mean, you were good .
i mean , like a fuckin 'freighttrain .
so, what happened?
injuries or what?
bullshit politics , man .
it's always politics .
like this thing we're in here .
he's paying you to tune me up .
i'll pay you more not to .
i'll write a check right now .
i got to go .
ok .
cash !
here's everything i have on me .
what do you say?
how about a rolex?
i got a real one .
come on .
it won't hurt too bad .
it's nothing personal .
just one second , please .
it's my jacket .
it's really expensive .
and just not not the eyes .
you're bleeding .
some jerk puked on the stairs , and i slipped .
i should sue .
you came back for me .
i came back to pick up my client .
no .
you came back for me .
i got to lie down , macey , please , in the back?
some piece of work , lenny nero .
you're calmly back stroking along in the big toilet bowl ... and somehow , you never let it touch you .
i mean , between working vice ... and your current so called occupation ... you must have seen every kind of perversion .
but you're just like some teflon man .
you still come out this ... goofball romantic .
it's my sword and my shield , macey .
all right .
a little b & e action .
what did you say?
nothing .
aah !
shit .
no , no .
please .
please .
please .
you can let me go , please .
i haven't seen yourface .
please .
let me go .
let me go , please .
oh , my ... holy ...
aah !
lenny .
lenny !
go to the sunset regent right now .
go !
go !
oh , christ .
he's jacking her into his own output .
she's seeing what he's seeing .
she's she's seeing herself !
aah !
no ...
oh ...
oh , my god .
god !
uhh !
oh , my god .
oh , my god .
lenny, what is it?
a black jack .
black jack?
a snuff clip .
it was lris .
the sickfucker killed her .
are you sure it's real?
oh , shit .
well , i lost my appetite ... for about a year .
want to take a look?
hell , no .
i don't fool with that .
you all right?
yeah .
you ok?
no .
not really .
here .
all right .
let's work it .
no , i i can't .
come on , lenny, you used to be good at this shit .
let's play it down .
what's the perp doing?
i can't .
you used to be a fuckin 'cop , ok?
that is a fucking murder .
what's he doing?
he stalks her ... and ... he rapes her ... and he does her .
and he records it .
he's a thrill killer .
he wants to see it again .
he records himself raping and killing her .
but he sends a signal to her .
so she feels what he feels while he's inside her .
the thrill while he's killing her ... sent to her ... heightening her fear ... which heightens the turn onfor him .
i've seen a lot .
so have i. too much .
it's a bad one .
yeah .
he makes her see her own death , feeds off the reaction .
he records it all .
everything .
and gives it to you .
he wants to share it .
of course he wants to share , man .
that's his deal .
he needs an audience .
this is a sick puppy .
why me?
'cause you're the magic man , lenny .
you make dreams happen , don't you?
if it's got something to do with the wire ... sooner or later , it washes up on your beach .
i've never dealt in black jacks .
everybody knows that .
he's just skull fucking you .
he just wants a reaction from you .
he wants to make you do something you do not want to do .
maybe he just figures lenny will appreciate it .
it's the dark end of the street .
how do you like it now?
jesus , mace , back off .
no .
this guy's one of your squld head contacts .
he's somebody that you know .
the problem with that is lenny knows everybody .
take the tape to the cops .
no .
no .
they'll crucify me .
so this wire freak gets to keep running around , huh?
lenny's right .
the police will think he's the perp ... or they'll go through his client list and ruin his life ... such as it is .
i'll call my buddies at homicide .
i'll tell them lris was a friend of mine ... and that'll put me in the loop .
i'll get the forensics and all that shit .
get some sleep .
i'll call you when i get something .
relax !
lenny !
keep moving , man .
somebody's thinking about you a whole lot .
leave me alone .
don't come to my house .
are you trying to ruin my life?
iris is dead .
she was murdered .
who did it?
i don't know , but this guy's real damaged goods .
iris knew someone was after her .
she said you were in danger, too .
i'm not in any danger .
no more games .
whatever you're hiding , whatever's going on ... you have to get out of here now .
then what?
are you gonna protect me?
are you a big tough guy?
you're a fucking talker .
you don't even own a gun .
i have a gun .
it's under my bed .
you don't know whatyou're fucking with .
tell me .
tell him , faith .
go on .
lenny just stopped by to give me some bad news .
an oldfriend of mine's been murdered .
remember lris?
how the fuck did you get up here?
charm .
tell you what , lenny .
just for you , hmm?
make you a deal .
why don't you just take her?
if she's so unhappy and wants to leave , she can go .
i'll let her decide .
faith always knows what she wants .
don't you , baby?
see?
hands off .
i'll tell you something else .
i'll tell you this, you fuck .
if she says she stays, you go .
you crawl back in your cockroach hole ... and you never cross my vision again .
faith ...
come on .
come on .
i've made my choice , lenny .
get him out .
get him out !
you're fucking crazy , faith !
come with me !
faith !
i don't love you anymore !
do you understand that?
you mean nothing to me !
leave me alone , lenny , please .
you said you were gonna get lris out of this .
now you understand the danger we're in .
that was so sweet what you said out there .
so touching .
i almost believed it .
i don't think he understands you did it for him .
he doesn't even know what's going on .
leave him alone !
i'd leave him alone if he'd stop coming around ... and you would just stop talking to him !
the only time a whore should open her mouth ... is when she's giving head .
shit !
mace !
help !
shit !
mace !
help !
don't be shy , lenny .
this is yourfloor .
let's go .
lenny , guess who's going to the hospital?
can we be smart here?
i can make itworth yourwhile .
i'm not saying i mind a couple of shots .
just go light is all i'm saying .
here , look .
take my rolex .
ooh , nice watch .
is this impact resistant?
yeah , sure .
aah !
you stupid piece of shit !
you stupidfuck .
get up !
come on .
get up !
unhh !
oh , ho .
pain , pain !
hey , lenny, we tried tofind a smaller girl ... to beatthe shit out of you , but itwas short notice .
itwas short notice .
oh !
ow !
that one had to hurt .
safety's on .
uhh !
come on .
let's go .
hey, wait !
ohh !
that'sfucked up .
i need a drink .
get some rest .
the cops know they'll never nail this guy ... the second they walk in the room .
it's all about whatthey see walking in dead hooker , handcuffs , penetration .
cops are lazy .
they know nobody gives a shit about a dead hooker .
they're road kill , right?
they'll take some pictures , make some jokes ... and just shrug it off like it's a random kill .
it's a trick gone wrong .
it's the kind you never solve .
that doesn't add , does it?
because lris said she knew somebody was after her .
that is not random .
if they get me [ siren ]
she said " they .
if they get me .
this whole random sex killerthing is bullshit .
somebody whacked her for a reason .
so this guy's not a psycho?
no , he's a psycho .
to do what's on thattape ... he's not a well adjusted human being .
i gotta get some sleep .
ok , lenny .
putthat down ... and i'll check on you tomorrow .
hey, you wantto rub my neck?
my shoulder's real sore .
ok .
all right .
come here .
right here?
oh, yeah .
ohh ...
don't stop .
how's zander?
he'sfine .
i miss him .
he misses you, too .
i'm real sorry about being so hard on you earlier .
it's justthat i see you ... getting sucked into this deeper and deeper , and ...
macey , come on .
i know you still love me .
how can you do this infront of your child?
infront of your own son?
macey , hold on !
lnfront of your own son !

they've just been saying words overjeriko .
tension's running pretty high down here .
faith ok?
yeah .
she's leaving with gant , so i gotta boogie real quick .
iris checked into the regent last night under afalse name .
she paid cash .
she was hiding out .
yep .

the guy had a knife to my throat in my living room .
relaxing might be right out .
aah !
oh , man .
that is one unbelievable piece of eyefuck .
skipthe art criticism, tick .
what can you tell me aboutthe wearer?
that guy isfucked up .
we know that .
no .
the killer's got some kind of distortion ... in the visual cortex .
the color and gray scale values are all messed up .
like color blindness .
see the peak period ratios?
there could be some kind of tumor or brain lesion .
whoever's doing this is using a box to splitthe signal
you ever make a box like that?
yeah , but i can't see the gear well enough to see if it's mine .
i don't like this .
this is not good .
what?
it's cutting close to me .
she was just here , man .
who was?
iris !
pay attention !
iris was here?
the other night , shaking like a junkie ... saying she wanted me to copy some clip .
whatwas it?
she wouldn't let me see .
she was going to give it to you to holdfor her ...
iike insurance or something .
she never gave me a tape .
think backto what she said .
she came in crying .
she wanted to go to my car .
can we go to your car?
you have to see something .
something about my car .
in your car .
that's a handy little attitude adjuster .
damn .
i'm boxed in .

i justwantto get my car back .
the place is closed .

officer steckler .
i'm that eight hundred pound gorilla in your mist, fucker !
i make more money in a day than you make in a year !
and my lawyer loves spending my money ... dragging sorry ass, aryan , robocopfuckers into court .

it's that rap asshole .
you're that rapper puke .
jeriko one?
you're the one that's getting all the gangbangers together ... going downtown , forming citizen groups ... trying to rake the lapd over a cheese grater?
that's right , and you gonna be in my next song .
it's gonna be called " robo steckler .
it's all about a cop who met his worst nightmare ... a nigger with enough political juice ... to scrunch his ass like a stink bug .
you gonna befamous, fucker !
i don'tthink so .
whatthefuck?

and , lenny , don't get pulled over , ok?
you know whatthis tape could do if it got out?
yeah .
i got a pretty good idea .
peoplefinding out ... seeing ... thatthe lapd justflat out executed jeriko one .
jesus .
jesus .
maybe they oughtto see .
maybe ... buttonight's probably notthe best night .
mace .
come on .
we're rolling .
i don'tthink those cops did lris .
whoever lris was wearingfor killed her .
why?
lenny : lf those cops had gotten hold of her ... they'd have beat it out of her who she was wearingfor ... and gone afterthem, too .
our killer is running as scared as we are ... which makes him really dangerous ... judging by how scared i am .
hold it up .
let her go .
sounds like tick's already celebrating .
you seem overdressed forthis party .
i wanted to look niceforyou .
hey, tick , i gotto talkto you .
shit !
he's been cooked off .
mace : ls he dead?
no , but hisfrontal lobes are like two runny eggs .
they put an amplifier in line to boostthe signal ... and itfries his brain .
tick !
it's lenny !
hey , hey, tick , come on !
tick , it's me .
lenny .
come on .
wake up !
tick !
come on !
come on, tick , come on !
he's totally cut off from the outside world .
how long does it last?
forever .
those two psycho cops are on a slash and burn ... tofind the tape and covertheirtracks .
tick is a known duplicator .
they wanttofind outwhat he knows , if copies were made ... orwho might've wired up lris .
it doesn't even get investigated as a homicide ... since he's technically alive . since he's technically alive .
yeah .
that's right .
he's technically alive .
seems sophisticatedforthem .
these are not subtle guys .
there's more to this than you think .
what do you mean?
all i'm saying is ... you don't know how high up thefood chain this thing goes .
i heard stuff .
what stuff?
i heard stuff , smoke , rumors .
i've heard stuff .
i've heard stuff about a death squad .
they're a group of guys , cops , loyal to the hard line school .
guys who've had too many years of city hall , review boards ... and the goddamn media pissing down their necks ... suspending cops right and left , tying their hands ... while these same people are squealing ...
save us !
save us !
do something, you morons .
crime is totally out of control .
bullshit , max .
it's conspiracy paranoia .
the issue isn'twhether you're paranoid .
the issue is whether you're paranoid enough .
christ .
exactly .
get religion , man .
i love you like my own blood , lenny ... but don'twalk near me in public right now , ok?
the only card we gotto play is the tape .
get itto the media .
that's right .
blow it open .
run that on the eleven o'clock news ... by midnight, you've got the biggest riot in history .
they'll see the smoke in canada .
whatthe hell are you saying pretend it didn't happen?
i didn't say that .
it happened .
the lapd executed ... one of the most important black men in america .
who thefuck are you to try to bury it?
trying to rake the lapd over a cheese grater?
you want blood running in the storm drains , go do it .
two hundred thousand gangbangers will spread through this city ... and burn it to thefucking ground , mace .
once thefire starts ... the cops will cap off anything that moves .
it'll be an all outwar .
i don'tthink so .
maybe it's timefor a war .
you really wantthat on your head , mace , huh?
really?
whoever did lris did tick .
it's the same sick wirehead shit .
it's the same reason to burn the trail .
if faith knows anything aboutthis , and she does
somebody's going to kill faith?
yeah, you're not rid of me
no, you're not rid of me
i'll make you lick my injuries
i'm gonna twistyour head off , see?
till you say , don'tyou wish you
never , never met her?
don'tyou , don'tyou wish you
never , never met her?
don'tyou , don'tyou wish you
never , never met her?
don'tyou , don'tyou wish you
never , never met her?
don'tyou , don'tyou wish you
never , never met her?
don'tyou , don'tyou wish you
never , never met her?
don'tyou , don'tyou wish you
never , never met her?
aah !
jesus , lenny , you scared thefuck out of me !
what do you want?
we know aboutjeriko .
iris made me a copy of the tape .
i was trying to keepyou out of this .
i know .
how'd it happen?
why was lris riding around with jeriko wearing a wire?
faith , listen look at me .
you gotto trust us .
we're here to helpyou .
all right .
i'll talkto you alone .
mace is in this .
tell us .
faith .
philo , he's gotten obsessed with playback .
he's a total wiretripjunkie .
he's such a controlfreak , he's been having peoplefollowed .
he's recording his business partners 'phone calls .
he's wiring up people left and right .
philo and jeriko weren't getting along .
he was afraid jeriko was gonna dump him ... but he wasn't sure , so he starts with the surveillance .
a couple of nights ago , he wires up lris ... and he sends her and the other girl , diamanda ... overto jeriko's table .
hi , baby .
hi .
my name is lris .
hey .
i got a presentforyou .
you are so beautiful .
so that night , lris calls up crying .
she'sfreaking out .
she comes over , and she plays the tape .
philo loses it .
he can't believe the disaster she's gotten him into .
he's afraid the cops will beat it out of her ... who she's been workingfor and then come lookingfor him .
why didn't he just go public with the tape?
save himself thatway?
falth : lf it got out he spied on his own artists ... he'd lose all his other acts , and it'd be overfor him .
shh .
so he gives lris some money .
he tells herto check into a hotel under an assumed name ... until he canfigure out whatto do .
hefigured outwhatto do .
you think he killed her?
the killer knew where she was because he put herthere .
what a nightmare .
i don't know where thefuck she is , butwe're late .
let's go .
philo , how do you want me to work it atthe bonaventure?
want me downstairs atthe party or upstairs atthe suite?
lenny .
leave here with me right now .
come on .
we'll talk aboutthat later .
no , man .
i need to know .

mr. gant , afew questions , please?
well , i'm certainly in the moodfor a party .
wade, take her upto the suite .
no problem .
you go and have a glass of champagne ... or six .
see you upthere in a bit , helpyou ring in the new year .
i liveforthe moment .
pussy whipped , sorry ass motherfucker .
oww !
take it easy .
where are they now?
he's got her up in the room , under guard .
he's still working the party ... acting smooth like nothing's nothing .
i say we work a trade .
what do you mean?
give him the clip .
it'sfucking brilliant .
the tapefor faith .
i know he'll gofor it , and i can set it up .
this is whatwe laughingly referto as a plan , right?
just getyour butt down here .
if i'm not downstairs , go to the room .
it's twenty two oh three .
you writing?
two two zero three .
if he gives us any shit ... we kill them all .
what do you say?
really scatterthe pigeons .
we gotto get overthere .
can you borrow a dress from cecile or something?
i'm not going .
gant's going to do her rightthere .
shut up .
lenny , parkyour mouth and listen .
it's a setup .
think about it .
why's he sending tapes to you?
to getyou to rush in ... put a bullet in you , one in her , and the gun in your hand .
yeah, that sounds right .
i'm going .
you gonna getyourself killedforthis?
forthis toxic waste bitch?
whatthefuck are you doing?
this is your life !
right here !
right now !
it's real time, you hear me?
real time !
time to get real , not playback .
you understand me?
she doesn't love you anymore .
maybe she did once , but she doesn't now .
these are used emotions .
it's time to trade them in .
memories were meanttofade .
they're designed thatway for a reason .
have you ever been in love with ... someone who didn't return that love?
yeah , lenny ...
i have .
didn't stopyou from loving them , right?
or being able to understand them ... orforgive them?
i guess .
didn't stopyou from wanting to protectthem ... did it?
when i met faith , she was just another ... another runaway ... giving twenty dollar blow jobs to buy crank .
just another lost soul .
and she had this voice thatwas ...
well , itwas scary .
like she could take all the hurt and rage ... of the entire world ... and lift it upto heaven in one voice .
i helped her .
and i promised herthat i'll always just be there ... to protect her .
see , it's not about what's in her head .
it's aboutwhat's in mine .
i can't let go of the promise .
it's like it's all i have left .
no , it's not .
come on .
let's go to a party .
the end of the world, yeah !
shit !
let's bail .
hey , mace .
you look great in that dress .
i mean , betterthan i would .
thankyou , i think .
come on , let's go .
hold it rightthere !
what's your plan ... for getting into the most sold out party in history?
relax , mace .
this is what i do .
you see gant?
uh uh .
oh , shit .
come on , max .
come on , buddy .
come on , buddy .
the customeryou have called is unavailable ... or has traveled
all right .
i still got one ace to play .
gant's gotwhat i want .
i've gotwhat he wants .
this is the original .
there are no copies .
that's why it's a makeable deal .
this tape is a lightning bolt from god .
it's worth more than you , more than me ... and more than faith .
you understand?
it can change things that need changing ... before we all go off the end of the road .
you do not have the right to use itfor currency .
so if you go ... you go alone .
i care aboutyou , lenny ... a lot more than you know ... which makes us both pretty stupid , huh?
but if you pawn this tape ... you mean nothing to me .
excuse me .
excuse me .
you see that guy overthere?
that's deputy commissioner palmer strickland ... the sanctimonious prick who busted me out .
his ass is so tight ... when hefarts only dogs can hear it .
if there's one cop who's not dirty , it's him .
take itto him .
you want me to trust a cop?
no .
trust me .
here .
what if you're wrong?
go .
excuse me .
commissioner ... there's a clip in here thatyou need to see right now .
if itweren't new year's eve , i'd have you arrested ... for possession of illegal equipment .
just look atthe clip .
you wantto know who killed jeriko ... go into that stall right now and hit " play .
cop : ls there a problem?
damn it , i knew it .
let's go .
let go of me !
sir?
wade , can we talk here like two human beings?
it's nothing personal .
remember me, youfucking bitch?
come on !
come on !
what are you looking at?
god damn it !
enjoy the party .
steckler ... steckler !

i can't believe this is happening .

don't make any assumptions about ourfriendship , lenny .
i didn't know you were color blind , max .
only way i could stand yourties .
manos arriba , amigo .
ooh .
glocktwenty three .
nice .
where's faith?
i sent herto the party .
ifigured i'd wait up here until you killed gant .
what makes you think i'm gonna kill gant?
you just did .
jesus !
statistically, that's the second most common word people say ... right before they die ...
shit " being number one .
so , uh ...
i killed gant , then you ran in ... and being on his payroll , you shot me .
that's the way it happened .
now i'm remembering .
i killed lris, too , didn't l?
they'llfind the original of her snuff clip ... in your apartment .
the one i left atthe club was a copy .
was i a really busy guy?
did i do tick, too?
you bet .
did you like it?
so, why , max?
why did you have to do lris?
ifeel like i gotta share this with somebody ...
'cause it's justtoo perfect .
i won't say anything .
oh , i know .
so , i'm working forthis puke , right?
and he says he'll pay me quite large to do the hooker ... but i also gotto do his bitch girlfriend ...
'cause she knows the score , and she's out of control .
only he doesn't know about me and faith .
so i say to myself , if i turn the job down ... he'll get somebody else , and i lose faith ... to coin a phrase .
to buy time , i do the skank ... but i still got to deal with gant .
it's him or me ... but i can't cap him without some chump ... to take thefall .
and who better ... than his girlfriend's loser ex boyfriend known criminal ... and who has been seen hassling them in public?
who is , regrettably , also your bestfuckingfriend .
no plan is perfect , lenny .
cheer up .
the world's ending in ten minutes , anyway .
you must be so pleased .
i mean , lfollowed your jellybean trail right here ...
iike a good little chump .
you gotfoggy on me a couple times .
rememberthat riff aboutthe death squad?
i had to keepyou from going to the cops .
i've heard stuff about a death squad .
the issue isn'twhether you're paranoid , lenny .
the issue's whether you're paranoid enough .
there neverwas a death squad?
no .
justtwo loose cannon cops covering their butts .
pretty zany , huh?
all this caused by a random traffic stop .
nothing means nothing , man .
you know that .
the whole planet's in totalfucking chaos .
the day of reckoning is upon us !
you gotta getwhatyou can while you can ...
'cause some shitbird can come put a twenty two ... in the back of your head ... any second .
aah !
how'd you hook upwith faith?
hmm ...
thisfuck hires me about a month ago to eyeball her ... only faith knows mefrom you .
so she comes upto me and says , " max, why are youfollowing me?
and i say , " i'll buy you a drink .
i'll explain .
and she says
do you enjoy watching me?
you're supposed to go downstairs , baby .
i know .
i don't always do what i'm told .
you know that .
so i said , " do you enjoy watching me?
come on , max .
play with me .
and then what'd you say?
i said , " yeah , i'd even do itforfree .
uh huh .
and i said , " that's good ...
because i like thefeeling of someone watching me .
i acquired the taste from lenny .
and then she said ...
since we're going to spend so much time together ...
why don'twe make the best of it?
the very best .
you know all aboutthat , don'tyou , lenny?
faith and me , wefound a place ... you could never reach , max .
