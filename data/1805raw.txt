this is the coast guard .
we're pulling alongside .

cold enough for you , sir?
where is it?
we found her ... just listing in the waves .
it was sheer luck , really , that we found her at all .
the storm had blown it east .
you haven't tried to board it , have you?
we're under orders to wait till you arrive .
i'm not one to question orders , dr. cirko , but it seems ridiculous not to board .
those men have got to be half starved .
i understand your concern , admiral .
this is a special case .
you're damn right it's a special case !
lose track of a nuclear sub for 46 hours and , boom , it shows up 5, 000 miles from where it went missing !
then glisson sends me a civilian biologist !
evolutionary biologist , admiral .
and you can take up any command issues with the white house .
i want those corpsman ready !
all right , i want a compartment search .
two by two .
stay alert .
this is not a drill .

check that .
we're in the missile room .

uh , place is absolutely desert .
there's nobody here .
we checked the reactor compartment , engineering spaces , nothing .
horse crap .
we checked twice , sir .
top to bottom , with infra red .
what about main control?
that's what i was gonna tell you about , sir .
nav system's fried .
silicone in the chips melted .
major electrical shorts in every system .
like she was struck by lightning .
no one touches anything .
i want an accurate record .
beijing , maybe .
moscow doesn't have its act together to pull off a stunt like this .
you don't look too surprised .
i'm not .
i've been expecting it .
jesse !
jesse , i don't hear the shower .
come on !
i'm not going .
we've already been through this , jesse .
i don't see why you have to dive now .
sweetie , i told you , this is the only time i can dive this year .
but dad puts me to bed on time .
are you saying that i don't put you to bed on time?
i'm just gonna stay here .
i'll be fine .
you can bribe me all you want .
i'm not gonna bribe you .
i'm gonna break you .

look , savannah , the halfling can read .
i read when it's interesting .
heard about your little stunt , by the way .
ye , daahally threw the book at him .
six weeks , no phone , no i. m. , straight home after school .

that is so sad .
i'm trying to make him feel better , idiot .
don't you two have glee club or something?
we just wanted to see what was so interesting .
nothing , spezmorph .

1734 , off the south coast of greenland , a six headed sea serpent was spotted .
give it back !
wow , you are deranged .
look , you wanna read about the sasquatch , that's fine .
but remember , we're brother and sister .
you reflect on me .
a'ight , so pay attention .
i was born paying attention .
just watch out for thermal drafts .
don't get near the wash of the vents .

like the first 50 times in the simulator .
it pays for me to be remedial with you .

ready when you are , dee .
this is dr. laura daughtery on board the mystic submersible . in the midst of a descent to the san juan de fuca plate .
she's gonna do fine .
i know
we'll collect biological samples to support the theory that the hotbed ecosystem is the origin of life on the planet .
okay , i wait at 5, 000 feet .
all right , keep on that heading .
it's nice up close .
okay , bottom sighted .
it's the hot vent ecosystem .
look at that thing .
it's flourishing down here .
i mean , there's tube worms , pompeiis , and spider crabs .
water temperature's up to 417 .
and it's rising as we near the vents .

no , mystic , that's a negative on the light .
something just swam by the aft porthole .
something with a light .
well , mystic , we're not seeing anything up here .
so , uh , what do you say we get back to the program?
are you seeing this?
better ...
i'm recording this .
craters .

the depth gauge is falling off the chart .
8 8, 000 ... 8, 500 .
wait ... wait , something's wrong .

yes .
my turn .
who are you people?
scientists , like you .
you know , i know who you are .
alexander cirko , from berkeley .
that was a long time ago .
they kicked you off the faculty because you ...
i found working in academia to be counterproductive .
ah , and who ys the bills now?
a mix of private and ... public concerns .
if we could continue .
no , no more .
not until you tell me what you know , and then , like scientists , we collaborate .
that's impossible , doctor .
why is that?
because the institute's research programs have been suspended indefinitely .
what?
the facility's now under the jurisdiction of the u. s. armed forces .
we'll need you to sign some things before you go .
i'm not signing anything .
i was the one that saw it .
alone , at 5, 000 feet !
i was the one that saw it in a disabled submersible .
a new vertebrate !
if i could have a word alone , please .
i empathize with your position .
i recognize that you had a profound experience .
you have kids , doctor?
no .
i had one at 21 .
you put yourself through school?
i won a series of fellowships .
i worked my way through .
and wanna know how?
i waited tables four nights a week to pay for tuition and daycare .
we are not on the same planet .
so don't try to empathize with me .
i worked my ass off to get here .
and i deserve to be a part of this .
endangered species ... don't deserve to be on the brink of extinction .
but they are .
you are a marine biologist .
you of all people must know that life ... isn't fair .
call kayla .
she's a gas .
she just got married , too , and i hear he's scottish or irish or something .
where are all the fish?
yes !

hey .
it's okay .
elrod .
elrod?

i ...
i feel sick .

you are disgusting , you know that?
just a second !
i'm gonna go get mom .
i'm counting to three .

mom , he's using my hairdryer and he's hogging the bathroom !

i know , i know .
sorry .
but ... something happened .
something amazing .
you're late !
i didn't teach him to do that .
dad , this is ...
you're not ...
you're not listening .
this is not some sort of a setback .
okay?
this is ...
i don't even know .
or if i can get back into the institute .
they've completely confiscated all of my research , dad .
that means all .
all of the dive tapes and everything .
mom , i'm bored .
sweetie , i'm talking to grandpa .
can you just go inside and watch tv or something?
dad , listen ,
i'm not being unreasonable , but you have to understand that ...
teach men to adapt themselves to some new world of the future .
leonard first saw the carcass while walking his dog on a pre dawn stroll friday morning .
and since then ,
local and state health officials are wondering what to do ...
mom !
mom !
mom !
what? !
jesse , what , what?
there it was , just lolling in the water .
it gave me quite a shock .
frankly , a whale carcass is a public health hazard .
something of this size could contaminate the water table , kick start a red tide .
we've taken precautionary measures .
cordoned off the beach until the carcass can be dealt with .
shut down us 17 , cut down on the looky loos .
we've got to look out for the interests of the public at large , you know?
authorities claim that the decomposed carcass is a sperm whale that died at sea and drifted to ...
dad , i'm gonna call you back .
however , some locals are less sure .
so , what do you think it is?
well , isn't that obvious?
it's moby dick .
whatever it is , whew !
it stinks .
in sullivan's island , south carolina , i'm marilyn prickett .
you believe me , right?
i'm ...
of course i do .
i just ...
i'm trying to understand .
well , honey , i'm trying to understand too , you know?
shh , you're gonna wake up the kids .
oh , screw waking up the kids , baby .
something happened to me .
i know you believe that .
don't treat me like i'm crazy .
no , no , i didn't say you were crazy .
i ...
honey , you were knocked .
no !
i was clear as a bell !
you were unconscious when bug found you .
hon , i don't think you were in your right mind when ...
what?
when what?
when george drowned .
george did not drown !
something happened ... and you were knocked ... and he drowned .
no .
that's it .
that's all that happened .
it was an accident .
look , you know ...
i don't know how else to put this .
i'm just asking you to believe me .
i am trying .
i ...
i just don't understand why you're driving to south carolina .
so i can convince myself ... that it wasn't my fault .
okay .
charleston , south carolina , that's right .
as early as possible .
all right , let me check the computer for you , ma'am .
um , do you have anything tonight?
um , let me see here .
we do have one .
it's a connecting flight for one passenger .
is that all right?
um , you better make that two tickets .
all right .
ladies and gentlemen , there is some evidence that this is simply a natural phenomenon .
this was recovered near the sighting in south carolina .
the tooth has no known antecedent in the fossil record .
it is as if it just fell from the sky .
