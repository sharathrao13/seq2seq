every passing minute witnesses billions being spent .. .. all over the world to counter terrorism .
and with each of these passing moments .. .. terrorists make a new plan to do something far more dreadful .
maybe in some other part of the world .. .. precisely at this moment in time .
very good .
very good .
nobody comes to know of anything when terrorists lose everyday .
however , any of those days , when they happen to win .. .. the loss to the human life is immense .
nobody knows how many officers .. .. work day and night to turn their victories into defeat .
we have intelligence information .. .. that the terrorists are planning .. .. something heinous seven days from now on the 10th .. .. , which will kill at least twenty five thousand people .
when?
where?
how?
we don't know anything .
they have plans , network and the targets .
and all that we have is seven days .
the car that you see in front .. .. is the same car which is said to have a bomb .
the entire anti terrorist cell is present here .
and it is hoped that they would be able to bring .. .. this grave situation under control .
that's good , we will be free .
shashank ..
what?
he won't let the bomb explode ! .
don't look back .
ragvan ..
sir .
check if someone is spying on us from the building .
right sir .
sir , you are right .
there indeed are some people on rooftop .
they are the ones spying on us .
aditi , ragvan , pawar , come with me .
shashank and roy , you cover us from this building .
and shashank , shoot only when absolutely needed .
sir .
who the hell smokes on duty here?
roy , let's move .
nobody will come from outside .
understood?
shashank .
shashank .
we have been deceived again .
why so?
the bombs we diffused during our training .. .. had their wires in either red or green .
all the wires here are white , my friend .
figure something out .
yes , i will .
you know that .
hands up .
aditi , caught on the west wing sir .
how many people?
four .
two of yours and two of mine .
we'll see .
i still don't have a shot , aditi .
two for you , two for me , isn't it?
what?
opc 1 6 has diffused the bomb in the car .
there was a gun fight in the nearby building resulting .. .. in a terrorist's arrest .
when we were standing there .. .. there was a big blast in the parking lot behind .
after that .. excuse me , madam .. please ..
out .. out ..
i will keep you informed .
hello .
come in .
dg bose .
morning .
dg sinha .
the home minister must be arriving but you may carry on .
i will brief him .
sir , we have been working on a person .. .. for the last eight months .. .. of whom we don't have any records .
he controls all those who .. .. spread terrorist activities in our country .
sir .
he enjoys support from three countries .
many of the people from our department work for him .
one of his men has been arrested .
we will get information about him very soon .
the bomb blast today morning was his handiwork .
and we have concrete information that .. .. a week from now , for the 1 0th may , he is .. .. hatching such a conspiracy which will result in a .. .. ioss of twenty odd thousand people .
how?
we don't know that , sir .
who is this man?
we don't know that too .
his photo , his sketch?
no , sir .
what do you know about him?
i know his name , sir .
jambwal .
you can't handle a couple of blasts in delhi .. .. and trying to teach international politics to me?
we are answerable to the government .
sir .
hello , siddhant .
hello .
you wished for a meeting?
he is mr. raidu , the lndustries minister .. .. and he is dlg siddhant .
yes , i know .
i saw your interview on tv in the morning .
very good .
mr. raidu .
please come .
sir , i have spoken to them .
they say .. .. that the bomb blast which took place today .. .. is the handiwork of some big terrorist .
hello .
he is on with the investigations .. .. shall i stop him?
i will tell you what to do after that .
it was swami ji .
there is a press conference in some time .
they are demanding to close down the atc .
what are you talking , mr. raidu?
in hindi .
in your language .
if swami ji has said so , we will have to comply .
this is not the way .
let me speak to him .
i cannot close something down like this .
swamiji has 40 mps .
better think what you want to do .
want to run the government or the atc?
i'll come .
okay .
what do you think?
why do these people want the atc to close down?
you are crossing the line .
what was the name you mentioned?
yes ..
jambwal .
don't ever mention it again .
never to anyone .
who knows who would turn into your enemy !
there is much more than what meets the eye .
if you can't close your eyes .. .. at least learn to keep your mouth shut .
yes , sir .
got it !
how did they know that our man is in the opposite building .
if our man is amidst them , someone from .. .. theirs must be in among us too .
you know !
i don't know about 'inside 'but there is someone on the periphery , for sure .
good morning , sir .
here is a fax from the home ministry .
altaf .
what do you know about jambwal?
what is he going to do on the 1 0th?
heard that something catastrophic will happen this time .
nothing like that will happen , altaf .
you will tell us everything .
your wife and children are in sultanpur .
in the past tense .
it is jambwal's principle to destroy the .. .. weaknesses of the ones who are caught .
our job doesn't let us make friends .
nor does your job let you do that .
after working honestly for twenty five years .. .. we get a fax to close down this department .
one fax .
no space for discussions even .
it's an order .
what have i earned in these twenty five years?
forget a friend .
i don't even have a person .. .. who would ask me what my wish is .
you are in the same situation .
you risked your life and now your people want you to swallow this .. .. and end your life .
what have you earned , altaf?
nothing .
why don't we become friends?
while i oblige you .. .. you reciprocate by obliging me .
we already share a bond of enmity , don't we?
and i have played my part to perfection .
one more will do !
yeah , going on !
yes .
i will keep you posted .
altaf's file .
okay .
bye .
altaf is a goner today !
sir is in a horrible mood today .
his mood is going to ruin our night .
keep watching .. the meeting will last a long time .
i don't know what you see in him .
even i don't understand that .
but he has style .
sir .. that fax .
which fax?
they say that the atc will be closed down in a week?
not in a week .
in seven days .
and the whole world can turn upside down in seven days .
the whole world can turn upside down in seven days , huh !
hello?
all dcs in the conference room .
right away .
come on .
okay , is everyone ready?
it's gonna be a long night .
shall we order for dinner?
chinese .
shashank ..
chinese ..
sorry , sir .
please come .
this is my place .
eight months ago , i had appointed an agent in bulgaria .
her name is neha .
i just received a call from neha .. .. and she told me that one of jambwal's close aide .. .. himmat mehendi , who handles jambwal's finances .. .. has been arrested .
he was drunk and driving .
now , listen to me carefully .
shashank , and aditya , both of you will go there
and as soon as himmat is released .. .. you will kidnap and take him to the place recommended by neha .
and then , make him talk .. .. about jambwal's whereabouts .. .. and his plans for the 10th .
but there is a problem .
we cannot make this mission an official one .
if you are caught in this mission , neither do i know you .. .. nor do you know me .
it all depends on what we can do in the next seven days .
either this ..
or this .
all the best , boys .
siddhant , how can shashank go?
his sister is being engaged tomorrow .
the engagement is in the morning . the flight is in the night .
i was going to become a pilot .
don't know how i got stuck here .
it is good .
at least you will die alone here .
don't know how many innocent people you would have risked there .
you are funny .
yes .
let's rock , boys .
let's rock , sir .
i have spoken to them .
they will release you by monday .
call up as soon as you are released .
oh .. don't pluck raw buds ..
oh .. don't pluck the raw buds ..
the gardener will get annoyed .
the gardener will get annoyed .
congrats .
thanks .
hi , guys .
did you come right now?
thank you .
what happened?
nothing .
i always felt there is a lot of time in his going .
but didn't realize .
look at this .
please , don't fight today .
aditya , good that you are here .
you are aware , aren't you .. .. that you have to directly go to the airport from here .
yes .
have you brought the clothes?
yes .
just a minute ..
shashank , i am thinking ..
why do you save him all the time?
forget it .
let bygones be bygones .
it is anu's engagement today .
yes .
you look stunning today .
i always appear stunning to you .
i know .
anu .
you are right .
don't know whether i am right or not .
but this wretched job .
returning home at two in the night and leaving early at six .
and then , who knows?
a call would come one fine day .. .. that i will never come back .
then a medal and a letter from the ministry .
you deserve much better .
much better .
hey , no more flirting with our princess .
okay , i am guilty .
come here , man .

look at me .
there is blood on my shirt .

there isn't any way out .
how does she know that my name is himmat mehendi?
come on inside .
i will tell you .

you said what my name is .
himmat .
mehendi .
age .
i am forty four years old .
but my parents have recorded two years less on the passport .
they are illiterate , you know .
what are you doing here , himmat?
you brought me here , and now you are asking me what i am doing?
what are you doing here in canada?
i was called to canada .
who called you to canada?
you know that .
very funny .
for what?
i don't know that .
what is happening on the 1 0th?
what is happening?
there isn't any festival even .
what is jambwal going to do?
no one can ever know about jambwal's activities ..
what will you tell him?
everything .
what?
i will tell him everything .
he is a police man .
that's why .
he can harm you .
he won't .
how do you know?
some faces make you feel .. .. you can relate to them .
and do these relationships work?
sometimes , they do work .
himmat mehendi .
drink .. here ..
what do you do for jambwal?
i teach the moves .
the movements of the pawns .
their international movements .
there are dollars , dinars , pounds !
black , white and blue money .
green buckes , our money , their money , i talk about money .
i play with money .
with jambwal's money .
the source of jambwal's money .. .. when it should be seen and when it should remain hidden , everything .
and nothing is out in the open .
everything is here .. inside .
no one can peep inside , right?
this is what i do for jambwal .
so , you are the money behind that madness .
i am mere money , sir .
rather the world is mad .
a small man comes from punjab here , to canada .
he does small things , small amount of money laundering .
a little bit of here and there .
one day , he gets a huge amount , to take from lraq to america .
he carries it .
he later finds out .. .. three hundred sixty people murdered .
that man is scared .
he thinks that he will never work with jambwal after this .
but jambwal never listens to anyone's refusal .
he kidnaps him from home .
then he does what jambwal says .
and he will continue doing it till such time jambwal asks him to do .
look ..
you two lndian soldiers .
and this little lady .
jambwal will crush you while you chant your national anthem .
jambwal is watching everything .
and he never forgives .
it isn't late even now .
there is still time .
it would have been late .
but it won't be late now .
you guys are under arrest .
i have heard everything .
put it down , inspector .
no account .. .. for bullets is kept on the mission that we are on .
thousands of bullets have returned unsuccessful .. .. in the past 17 years .
we don't aim false .
but i shoot the first bullet .
we can talk .
of course .
but after lowering the guns .
because even if a single bullet is shot .. .. whoever loses their life , you will be the ones dead .
down .
according to our intelligence .. .. a dangerous criminal , jambwal , has planned .. .. something lethal and catastrophic for the 10th of this month .
we are here to investigate it .
and this is the only man who can help us .
so , right now , i would need you to cooperate with me , officer .
and we don't have much time .
officer .
okay .
i will help you .
and ..
thank you .
for saving my life , guys .
but we will not live here .
we will live in my house .
and where is his house?
i don't dare to believe anyone in the office .
i haven't called a colleague today , but the one whom i love .
today i am going to do something in which anything can happen .. to me ..
.. to our family .
if anything happens to me ..
take care of everyone .
you are the eldest .
what is going to happen on the 10th?
give me my bottle .
please , one more .
give him , please .
nonsense .
what is going to happen on the 10th?
only jambwal knows the entire plan .
we just know our parts .
the sitar knows which chord to play .
the drum knows its rhythm .
and the strings know of its notes .
and then , there are trumpets somewhere far away .
and just near jambwal , lie a few drums .
then jambwal raises his hands .
and there is music .
go away from here now .
what to tell you?
how does he look?
don't ask this question .
the one who comes to know this doesn't survive .
how does he look?
he is tall .
he walks like a lion .
he has curly hair .
and his smile is like small children .
very cute .
i don't know about his eyes .
nobody has seen into them .
they say there is death in them .
his brother was recognized by the police .
everyone was worried as to what will happen .
but , only jambwal had the answer .
what else do you know about him?
i have already said what i knew .
don't try to know more .
please go and think about your family .
my wife isn't going to come back .
never .
and as far as my son is concerned , i have killed him .
what will you kill him?
what will you kill my son?
sir , shall i make the entry?
okay , sir .
you may hide it from your people .
how will you hide it from my people?
you close my eyes , and you can't see yourself?
siddhant .
do you really think that i am with them?
i have sent two younger brothers in such a danger .. .. that i can't even try to find out about them .
on top , i have to suspect you , as well .
i hate this job .
everything will be all right .
don't worry .
hello?
you removed altaf from there?
we didn't come to know of it .
and what are you doing in the office till now?
go to mg road .
someone waits for you there .
drive carefully .
what happened?
come with me .
no .. no ..
he can really tolerate a lot .
i thought he'd die after being hit so much .
do you know where he gets so much strength from?
he is absolutely convinced , that jambwal .. .. will kill us and have him rescued .
right .
he is jambwal's devotee .
i have an idea .
if we make him believe .. .. that jambwal wants to kill him , then?
good idea .
he will definitely crack up .
if he happens to believe , he will speak .
good , then we will do it tonight .
what did you say yesterday?
what did i say?
that you killed your son .
shashank .
i don't want to talk about this here .
you will have to .
i said , i don't want to talk about this .
you will have to talk about this .
didn't i tell you that i don't want to talk about this?
you will have to talk about it .
no .
shashank , it's personal
no .. no .. it's not personal .
shashank .
it's not personal at all .
we are working with him .
we are in his house .
he will be showing us the way .
i want to know .. .. who we are working with , in whose house are we .. .. and who will be showing us the way?
such a man who can kill his own son?
so , you understand , it's not personal .
i want an answer .

damn it , i say , don't .
after that , priya couldn't stay with me .
whenever she did , she remembered kabir .
and she remembered my beastly face .
i have tried to bring her back many times .
even today i am doing the same .
shashank .
shashank ..
i had shot that ruffian .
and i lost kabir .
i lost my kabir .
i didn't kill my son .

i will ask just once .
i don't know .
this wasn't the deal .
this wasn't the deal .
we had taken the oath to risk our lives .
why our families?
why our families , sir?
do we kill their families?
how did this poor guy hurt them?
why should he .. die like this ..?
we are doing our work , sir .
why should anu suffer?
nothing will happen to anu .
i have spoken to them .

siddhant didn't tell us when we have to reach here .
he just said 'evening '.
anu , dive .
are you all right , child?

speak up , right now .
i will not even count till three .
asif and lrfan , two of jambwal's men betrayed jambwal .
i had to reach canada and kill them before the 1 0th .
because they were about to foil his plans .
i don't know anything else .
ajay .
there was 99 at 2 zero hours .
we have a rat in the hole .
scan database .
revise all passwords .
seal all out going communication .
bravo 1 2 to sixteen zero five .
bravo 1 2 repeat to sixteen zero five .
99 , not to be reported .
do you copy me?
99 , not to be reported .
everyone clear the room , now .
why did you do this , roy?
my father retired at 1 2, 500 .
i would have retired at 22, 000 .
they offered so much money , sir , that i forgot everything .
neither this department , nor you ..
.. and nor ..
what do you know about jambwal?
i don't know anything more than you do , sir .
what is about to happen on the 10th?
i don't know , sir .
but i know that something huge will take place .
the code name of this whole operation is jeet .
and then , you will scan my computer .
how can i believe you?
i cannot lie to you anymore , sir .
i cannot lie to you anymore .
why did you do this , roy?
why did you do this?
what will i go out and say?
that you did all this for money?
no , sir .
the rest of them will also retire at 22, 000 .
who will interrogate you?
whom will you be able to face , roy?
sir .
you have always shown the way .
please .. give me a punishment , which should suffice .
i cannot live like this .
i cannot live like this , sir .
please .. sir .. please ..
i know that you like me a lot .
please don't reduce my punishment .
sir , i can't live like this .
please .
i can't believe this .
i don't know since when .. !
and we?
we couldn't conceive that someone in our office .
he was such a hard working guy .
i don't know what happened .
anyway , we are scanning his hard disk .
what the hell was that?
sir .. sir .. someone is there in my room .
he was shooting at me .
what?
what happened?
he was shooting at me .
shooting?
someone was trying to kill me .
someone shot at him in his room .

we will see .
we will check .
where are you leaving me here?
i will die if he comes here .
sit down , don't worry .
we will check .
dan , three shots , close range .
let's check the house .
lies .
all that i thought was a sham .
a man like jambwal cannot be anyone's friend .
he had sent someone to kill me .
i was mad to think that jambwal needs me .
i have helped him so much .
if i am caught once ..
and that too , you guys caught me .. he will kill me .
nobody can save me .
we will save you .
sit down , please .
nobody can save me .
his window was open .
he must have come from there .
let me go away from here .
nobody will kill you .
he will kill .
nobody can kill you .
we will save you .
we are with you .
nobody can save me from jambwal .
nobody else will try .
just tell jambwal's whereabouts?
and if we kill him , your life is not at risk .
but what if you cannot kill him?
we will keep saving you .
and if you kill him , will you release me?
i take an oath on god , i will never help a terrorist .
i will go back to my village .
i am really stuck here .
okay , we will let you go , but after jambwal is dead .
see , the truth is ..
i don't know where jambwal is .
but last week .. .. asif and lrfan had betrayed him .
they will know , for sure .
i will take you to asif then .
if you love me !
if you love me , take me in your embrace !
if you love me , take me in your embrace !
if you love me , take me in your embrace !
i am craving for a glimpse of yours .
i am craving for a glimpse of yours .
come , and take your possession .
give me a chance to behold you .
if you love me , take me in your embrace !
this consent of yours is killing !
these charms of yours are killing !
this seduction of yours is killing !
the troubles that others 'face because of your !
as if an effort to carve the glass .
this enticement of yours is killing .
give me a chance to behold you .
give me a chance to behold you .
all wishes still lie unfulfilled .
the heart still waits to be stolen .
all wishes still lie unfulfilled .
the heart still waits to be stolen .
there isn't any dream in my eyes .
no spell is cast over me , as yet .
let me just cross over in this boat of love .

if you love me , take me in your embrace !
i am craving for a glimpse of yours .
i am craving for a glimpse of yours .
come , and take your possession .
give me a chance to behold you .
greetings , i am very sorry , mr. asif .
that i came with these people here .
but i didn't have any other way out .
you may not know how badly i am being thrashed by these guys .. .. for the last three days .
i am like an accident ridden car .. .. whose steering , brakes and horn , everything is out of order .
they are asking me about jambwal's whereabouts .
tell me , can i tell them where jambwal is?
tell them that i cannot tell them where jambwal is .
then i thought , only asif or lrfan have the guts .. .. to be enemies with jambwal .
i don't know where lrfan is , tell me where he is .
or else , i will have to search for him .
but i will search him out .
tell me , where is he?
you know , i have a lot of works , i have to complete them .
jambwal doesn't forgive anyone .
he doesn't forgive anyone .
he will not forget even this time around .
please .. tell him .. for my sake .. please ..
why don't you tell them?
tomorrow , at five in the afternoon .
canmore .
look , this is known as jambwal's magic .
she is a nice girl .
don't let her go .
it is very painful .
look at me , i am signing the divorce papers tomorrow .
speak to me .
will you remove all your aggression at work?
you are speaking like brother .
think that i am your brother .
like her?
do you love her?
i don't know .

yes , ma'am .
i need you to see something .
roy's hard disk has a secret partition .
its name is jeet .
just as he had told us .
it contains a lot of e mails that were sent to a man named shally .
when renu traced the server , we found out .. .. that a man named venkat , accessed .. .. these e mails from a cyber cafe in karol baug .
i have sent raju behind him .
you were right .
there is much more than what meets the eye .
venkat works in the prime minister's office .
security department .
prime minister's office .
the files have been burnt .
nothing is left .
i will check the computer .
there is a hard disk partition called jeet in here too .
lots of coded e mails .
but only one new name .
bilal masood .
the pm is in canada on the 10th .
his life is in danger in canada .
why didn't you inform bose , then?
i was about to , when i happen to remember roy .
when i cannot trust anyone in my office , how can l ..?
i will go to canada tonight .
you didn't have it fixed till now .
you should have done it by now .

i will give you a call as soon as i find out something , ok?
take care .
okay .
i owe you one , bro .
thank you so much .
in the name of allah !
dan !
what happened?
he can't be jambwal , if he has died .
he is dead , himmat .
himmat , we have finished jambwal off .
be rest assured .
now you are free , from us , as well as from jambwal .
i didn't even think of being free from jambwal's clutches .
now , i will stop this illegal transfer of money .
i will go to my village and open a poultry farm .
although you have hit me a lot , you are real nice chaps .
if you happen to visit punjab .. .. just reach londwal and ask for mehendi's house .
they will directly bring you to my place .
welcome .
okay .
bye .
okay .
bye .
oh !
younger bother .
please ..
welcome .
thank you .
aditya .
shall we go to neha's house once?
maybe , she hasn't gone as yet?
she had written that she will go .
maybe .. come on .
sir .
brother .
brother , he is dan from canadian police .
he has helped us a lot .
danish .
siddhant .
what brings you here , sir?
i came to meet neha .
and you?
even we came to meet neha .
it's too late .
she's dead .
what?
she is not neha .
who had hired neha?
you are me?
she is neha .
the dead body which was found in priya's car .
his name was himmat mehendi .
the person who was moving around with you .. .. was jambwal .
'my name is jd . '
'nobody knows a thing about jambwal's activities . '
'jambwal sees everything . '
'jambwal doesn't forgive anyone . '
'he can't be jambwal , if he has died . '
he had two hurdles for his plan for the 10th .
asif and lrfan .
and he gave a contract to altaf in delhi to kill both of them .
and that evening , altaf was arrested .
'asif and lrfan , two of jambwal's men had betrayed him . '
'i had to reach canada and kill them before the 1 0th . '
'because they would foil his plan on the 10th . '
and that night , in canada , himmat mehendi .. .. and jambwal met with an car accident .
our agent neha , who followed them , didn't know jambwal .
she just knew himmat mehendi , and she gave me this information .
aditya and shashank , you came here to arrest himmat .
and jambwal was arrested .
and jambwal had you do what he wanted altaf to do .
we killed lrfan .
but asif .. suicide .. no ..
no , asif was killed by jambwal in our presence .
no , jambwal killed asif .
so what if he didn't shoot him?
at that moment , himmat wasn't with asif .
it was jambwal himself .
'why don't you speak? '
he didn't have any other way out .
he knew that you two would be arriving .
therefore , neha was killed and someone else took her place .
jambwal played with four senior officers of two countries .
he is really big .
and no one knows of his plan as yet .
sir , the information which this phone numbers will provide .. .. in the next half an hour is beyond your comprehension .
mr. raidu ..
yes , sir .
the first three numbers belong .. .. to the lndustries minister suryakant raidu .
and what if this doesn't hold true?
i am ready to go to the gallows .
okay .
i will tap these phones .
all the best .
thank you .
and sir , don't forget to watch the tv .
tv?
okay .
joseph , bring altaf downstairs .
and listen .
don't make an entry in the register .
come out .
go , altaf .
you are free .
i am going to the tv station from here .
exactly after five minutes i would state this in a live telecast .. .. that you have disclosed the names of five people to me .
i am going to lie .
then those people for whom you work .. .. will search for you wherever you are in this world , and kill you .
my lies will be caught .
but only you will die .
go .
you are free now .
or there is another way out .
you will testify on tv .
and then , i promise to save your life .
think it fast , altaf .
i don't have much time .
altaf has named some political and administrative bigwigs .
let's talk to aditi kumar .
altaf will answer this question .
hello .
what is this interview on the tv?
hello .
hello , how are you , sir?
whose name was mentioned?
hello .. yes ..
i have seen it ..
whose name was mentioned?
i will come to your office .
oh , listen .. did he take my name?
try to understand .
our phones are being tapped .
did they mention my name?
don't speak , please .
your name?
please disconnect the line .
whose name ..
why don't you understand , sir?
we will die .
shut up !
what is this?
but sir .. how can you be sure that jeet .. .. is such an important word in jambwal's plan .
before roy died , he said this word held some hidden meaning .
did you smoke?
no !
yes , sir .
and what else did roy say?
nothing else .
but there was one more name .
bilal masood .
who is this bilal masood?
i don't know .
watch this .
there are twenty six alphabets in english language .
a is the first , b is the second and c is the third .
this way 'j 'is the tenth .
j is the tenth .
e is the fifth .
that means , 10th may .
e is the fifth .
that means , at 5 o'clock .
and t is the twentieth .
but what's twenty?
that is what we have to find out .
give me a second , guys .
i want to show you something .
tenth may , 5 o'clock , at mac mahon stadium .
what is this?
it's a foot ball stadium .
but yes , tomorrow , at 5 o'clock , some .. .. twenty to twenty five thousand people .. .. are felicitating the lndian prime minister there .
twenty five thousand .
according to our first information .. .. twenty five thousand people will be dying .
we may perhaps come to know the meaning of 20 there?
but where is mac mahon stadium?
welcome to mac mahon stadium .
it's a pleasant evening and we have .. .. a wonderful crowd of 25000 people here to enjoy the game .
welcome to mac mahon stadium .
to celebrate the anniversary of the trade ties between canada and lndia .. .. this evening has been arranged , which .. .. will have a match , and some cultural programmes .
the lndian prime minister will be arriving in some time .
roger and i are with you to bring this exciting evening to you .
dan , where are you?
i am backstage .
the foot ball match will start in a while .
there is a cultural show before that .
i will keep you informed .
okay , i will be in the vlp area .
okay .
what are you doing here?
my children are performing .
i am getting late .
i will see you later , okay?
and this is the moment we all were waiting for , friends .
on the special invitation of the canadian government .. .. the lndian prime minister mr. manmohan singh .. .. has arrived to watch this match .
the canadian diplomats are welcoming him .
it's a very touchy moment for all the lndians living in canada .. .. that the lndian prime minister has come to watch this match .. .. and has indeed graced the occasion with his presence .
sir , a remote control has been found beneath .. .. neha's seat which indicates a bomb .
how much time?
sir , twenty minutes .
we don't know the size of the bomb .
we should evacuate the stadium .
impossible .
it is impossible to evacuate .. .. people in just 20 minutes .
the only way is to find the damn bomb and diffuse it , now .
copy that , sir .
dan , where are you , dan?
yes , siddhant?
who is the security in charge here?
security?
look for adler
adler?
yes , aditya .
yeah .
you check there .
it must be in the car park .
i am already in the parking lot , dan .
it has to be there as the security is heavy here since the last night .
check there .
search there .
you will get it there , ok?
i'll keep your posted .
who's adler?
yes , check over there .
who's adler?
i am adler .
listen , there is a bomb in the stadium .
we need back up , okay?
yes .
come there , i will tell you all about it .
siddhant , can't trace the bomb .
one second .
car number twenty .
sir .. sir .. four people are investigating the bomb in the stadium .
one of them had reached adler .
he has been captured .
we have alerted all our men in the stadium .
but sir , we should change the bomb location immediately .
we have been fooled once more .
why?
what happened?
it isn't a bomb .
it is a bomb factory .
you won't let it blast , right?
how big is it?
dan , it's a c 48 x h4 insulated bomb .
will it be diffused?
dan , this is c4 .
one block can blow up a fifteen storey building .
we have ten .
will it be diffused?
the whole stadium , dan .
the whole stadium .
how much time?
seventeen minutes .
and even i can't do anything in this much time .
dan , we will have to take this car away to somewhere safe .
it is twenty minutes from here .
we will try .
come out of the parking lot with the car , ok?
i will meet you there .
let's rock .
dan , where are you , dan?
where are you?
i am coming out of the parking lot .
where are you , dan?
come in .
sit down now .
behave like a good boy .
dan , come in ..
dan .

no response from sir even .
i am coming .
where is the car?
where is the damn car?
dan ..
dan ..

where are you taking me?
what have i done?
you tell me , what have you done?
what do you mean?

i work here .. what are you doing to me?
i will hit you .
and tell me when you are tired .
siddhant sir .. come in .. where are you?
hey , shahshank , where are you stuck?
no response even from dan .
aditya , we have got bilal masood .
it seems , you will have to search for the valley yourself .
over .
tell me .
i am telling you .
tell us where the jeep is , or else i will blow your head off .
aditya .
come in , dan .
come back with the car .
dan , i have just ten minutes , and i don't know the way .
come back with the car , or else they will start killing .. .. the children one by one .
shit !
run !
jesus !
every child is someone's kabir .
i want those children back .
please , dan .. please ..
i didn't know it contained so much .
i was just paid to change the car .
shashank .
any news of siddhant?
no , but there is another problem .
what?
there is another bomb .
same size .
how much time?
eight minutes .
it is impossible to go out of the residential area driving the vehicle .
there is a flying club across the road .
see what can be done .
copy that .
sir , the first car hasn't returned to the stadium .
everything has been known about the secret .
most of our men are dead or injured .
what's your position , dan?
position?
position safe now .
i don't think both our cars can reach the stadium on time .
mission failed , sir .
i repeat , mission failed .
where is he?
i don't know .
where is he?
siddhant dheer .
anti terrorist cell , delhi .
relax , officer .
himanshu verma , canadian police , special agent .
the reason of your arrival?
i am in the look out of a terrorist , sir .
jambwal?
yes sir .
we both are a bit late in reaching here .
i have already checked the north and the south wing .
but he is still on this floor .
go to east , i will take the west .
okay , sir .
here you are .
nice meeting you , sir .
nice meeting you .
the death that you brought for thousands is being carried away by me .
shashank .
whether you want to know or not .. but even i am in love with you .
although couldn't live with you , but i can lay my life for you .
are you from delhi , sir?
no , why?
no , sir .
because i studied in xavier's college .
our teachers said that there was someone senior .. .. to us by the name himanshu verma .. .. who came and joined the canadian police force .
so , you are from st. xavier's?
yes , sir .
i studied there for two years .
actually , i am from allahabad .
what a coincidence , sir .
i became a policeman because of you .
bring the car behind , immediately .
do you remember kathuria sir?
kathuria sir?
yes , sir .
the one who used to forget names ..
yes .. that .. yes ..
i remember his face .. but not the name .
the next time you meet him , tell him that i remember him .
sure , sir .
yes .. yes .. tell him .. that the next time .. .. i come to lndia i will definitely meet him .
come along , sir .
the story was false .
caught !
aditya , come in .
yeah , shashank .
i am sitting in the cockpit after eight years .
don't know whether i would be able to fly it or not .
don't be silly , shashank .
you will manage .
all that i can see is population till far .
i can't go out in so little time .
can't seem to find a way .
you will manage , shashank , come on .
there is only one lake three miles from here .
but there are buildings and houses around it .
the lake is so small , that we cannot drop the bomb .
we will have to crash the plane .
are you crazy?
drop the bomb anywhere .
it cannot be more important than your life .
look , north east .. north east .. scan more .
dan , i have just taken off .
i won't be able to reach there .
there is no other way out .
are you crazy , shashank?
drop the bomb .
aditya is right , shashank , drop the bomb .
if we throw the bomb anywhere , the death toll .. .. will be more than that in the stadium .
throw it ..
will you jump from the car if you don't reach the valley?
no .
you are a nice guy .
i wasn't irritated because you didn't marry anu .
i was irritated because anu couldn't get .. .. someone better than you .
sorry , pal .
i was such a fool .
do policemen not marry?
take care of anu .
she is a lovely girl .
hey , shashank , we both will take care of anu .
don't talk like crazy?
shashank , don't be crazy .
shashank , find another location .
there must be some jungle .
there must be some desert .
it's a bloody order , shashank .
there is nothing .
just this lake , i need your permission .
shashank , don't be crazy .
don't permit him .
aditya , don't be stupid .
sir , i need your permission .
sir , you always say 'yes 'to him .
you will have to refuse him today .
there is no other way out .
throw the bomb anywhere .
what nonsense is this?
don't be stupid .
do you know what you are saying?
thousands of people will die .
shashank , drop the bomb .
brother , you will not permit him .
don't be stupid .
will you agree?
what about me?
nobody waits for me at home .
neither mom nor dad .
i got all the love i needed from you people .
don't worry about me .
sir , i don't have much time .
i need your permission now .
i need the go ahead now .
is there any other alternative , shashank?
siddhant , don't give him the permission .
he is your brother .
no , sir .
there is no other way out .
throw the bomb anywhere .
eject from that plane now .
please .
sir ..
i need your permission now .
you can't do that .
