yekaterina orlova .
katya?
never heard of her .
the patronymic's borisovna .
katya borisovna orlova .
have a think , barley .
don't know a katya .
never screwed one , never flirted with one , never proposed to one , never even married one .
what is she , the usual fat arsed frump?
she visited the british council's audio fair in moscow exactly a week ago .
audio fair?
cassettes .
books of the bloody future .
so why didn't you go?
i can go .
i can not go .
l'm my own man .
but you wouldn't know anything about that .
crap , barley .
you rented a stand , booked your hotel , your flight ...
why didn't you show up?
i have a board .
i have family shareholders .
the firm's having withdrawal pains at the bank , if it's any of your bloody business .
it is .
tell me something .
do you know niki landau?
excuse me .
do you know mr bartholomew scott blair?
yeah , i know niki .
short arse polish cockney sales rep .
goes at it like a rabbit .
barley?
sure , i know barley .
house of abercrombie and blair , publishers , drunk or sober .
a gent .
one of the best .
i must speak to mr scott blair .
it is very urgent .
he's not here , darling .
but he was not here yesterday .
mr scott blair never came .
he's absent .
awol .
not among those present .
sorry .
lrritating little sod .
i'm quite fond of him really .
i have an important manuscript for him .
it is for mr blair .
only for mr blair .
listen , i'm trying to make a living here .
and not for mr blair , love him as i may .
might one inquire why she should ask niki about you?
i don't know .
i don't know her .
so you know niki , but not katya?
oh , now you're getting it , old boy .
ls that scotch over there?
help yourself .
hold everything .
ok .
you must be very kind and help me .
a russian friend of mine has written an important novel .
lts message is important for all of mankind .
nice .
ln spite of glasnost , my friend's novel cannot yet be published ... in the soviet union .
mr scott blair has undertaken to publish it ... with discretion .
don't worry .
with abercrombie and blair , your friend's book is virtually guaranteed to appear in total secrecy .
lf you love peace , please , take this to england to mr scott blair .
it is a gift of trust .
it is better that you smile .
excuse me?
smile .
this is anglo soviet cultural exchange .
we smile , we exchange culture .
looking scared is something different .
got it in there , have we?
this is dangerous for you .
you must believe in what you are doing .
smile .
we smile , we kiss .
formal russian kiss .
that's right .
now we've done it .
you have brought me an official farewell gift from ...
october publishing on the last day of the fair .
and i have given you shakespeare's sonnets for careful drivers .
would you ... like a nice dinner out somewhere?
it is not convenient .
thank you .
you can't think of any reason why a book editor called katya orlova should risk her neck to send you a manuscript?
barley?
who said ... " risk her neck "?
i did .
must be quite a book .
it is .
may i see it?
let's begin with the letter .
personal .
for mr bartholomew scott blair .
urgent .
we'd like to find out why a woman you don't know should send you a letter beginning " my beloved barley " , and sign herself " your loving k " .
she's potty .
certifiable .
where is this manuscript?
that's none of your business .
like hell it isn't .
she sent it to me as a publisher .
it's a bloody sight more mine than yours .
please calm down .
it's in safe hands , barley .
the manuscript was in three notebooks .
when niki couldn't find you in london , he had the sense to bring them to us .
the first notebook is worthless , scientifically speaking .
oh?
peacenik manifestos , slogans , poems , quotations .
it has psychological interest , minister , in so far as the writer sounds ...
absolutely barking .
would you say?
it's not a medical term , sir .
unstable , perhaps .
as for notebooks two and three?
genuine science .
written by someone in the business .
no question .
the business?
destruction paths , payloads , aim points , bias , rate of burn , trajectories , telemetry .
of course , it doesn't necessarily describe the true state of affairs .
what the hell does it purport to describe?
ln a nutshell , the soviet's strategic capability for waging nuclear war .
and addressed to boozy barley blair .
well , if it's strategic , we can't evaluate it without the americans .
so it's their baby , not ours .
throw scott blair to the americans .
unfortunately , we haven't found him yet .
eureka !
we've got him .
a lisbon bank account , my dears !
we've got him .
lisbon .
why did you run away?
run away?
i own a flat here .
why lisbon , barley?
why langley , bob?
you brought a woman?
what's it to you if i brought a woman , a man or a fuckin 'muscovy duck?
what do you do with yourself in lisbon , barley?
well , i was having a drink .
until i was interrupted .
mr blair?
eh?
i believe i'm addressing mr bartholomew scott blair .
yes?
correct?
yes .
i'm merrydew .
i'm from the embassy .
we received a rather urgent message for you over our link .
are you trying to tell me someone's dead , old boy?
no .
that would be consular .
i'm commercial .
well , i never knew an honest debt that couldn't wait till monday .
loosen your girdle , merrydew .
have a drink with the unwashed .
i say , blair , the man's the queen's emissary , for christ's sake .
have they moved the embassy , or are you hijacking me?
what's going on , tubby?
i'm commercial .
strictly commercial .
mr blair , sir?
my name's ned .
i'm about to move the goal posts .
there's no urgent message .
there's no crisis in your affairs beyond the usual .
i'm from british lntelligence .
come and meet the others .
this is clive .
this is walter .
over here is bob , who is almost family .
meet barley , everyone .
hello , barley !
proud to know you , barley .
i'm the odd man out here .
i work for the central lntelligence agency , which , as you probably know , is based in langley in the state of virginia .
let's have some fun .
let's do some good .
now isn't that jolly?
so , where are we all off to?
nicaragua?
chile? lran?
or are we just assassinating some local nuisance?
don't rant .
sit down .
perhaps you can tell us what this letter's all about .
recognise the handwriting?
read it slowly .
take all the time in the world , barley .
she's barmy .
who is she?
yekaterina orlova .
katya?
never heard of her .
the patronymic's borisovna .
katya borisovna orlova .
have a think , barley .
i don't know a katya .
never screwed one , never flirted with one , never proposed to one , never even married one .
what is she , the usual fat arsed frump?
so , she wrote you a letter signed " your loving k " , and you tell me you don't know her?
i told you .
i never met the hag .
she's off her tree .
she wasn't even there .
where?
at peredelkino .
lt's a soviet writers 'village .
they value their writers .
the ones who behave get their own dachas .
i was lucky enough to be a guest .
when was this?
three or four months ago .
one of my trips .
but there wasn't any katya .
what happened?
i was brilliant .
yes?
oh , yes .
how to save the world between lunch and dinner .
i was flying .
l believe in the new russia .
you may not , but i do .
20 years ago , it was just a pipe dream .
today , it's our only hope .
we thought we could bankrupt you by raising the stakes in the arms race .
gambling with the fate of the human race .
barley , you won your gamble .
nuclear peace for 40 years .
oh , rubbish .
what peace?
ask the czechs , the vietnamese , the koreans .
ask the afghans .
no . lf there is to be hope , we must all betray our countries .
we have to save each other , because all victims are equal .
and none is more equal than others .
it's everyone's duty to start the avalanche .
a heroic thought , barley .
listen , nowadays you have to think like a hero just to behave like a merely decent human being .
and did you believe this nonsense?
i don't know .
i believe it when i say it .
but you've got to be there .
you're taking a leak in some filthy public urinal , and the man in the next stall leans across and asks you about god , or kafka , or freedom versus responsibility .
so you tell him .
because you know .
because you're from the west .
and before you've finished shaking your dick , you think " what a great country .
that's why i love them .
and they're very fond of me .
anyway , ... later we talked about jazz , and i played some .
what , somebody had a saxophone?
what else?
drum kit?
rhythm section?
how many women were there?
three or four .
but no katya .
but there was someone , wasn't there?
yes .
there was someone .
someone who is the reason why we're all here .
yes?
a man or a woman?
name?
christ .
the way you people come alive when you smell blood .
they called him ...
dante .
as in " lnferno " .
the others said he was on holiday .
a drinking holiday .
he worked some place where drinking wasn't on .
everyone deferred to him .
he never spoke .
he just got drunk and stared .
stared?
mm .
at me .
did dante arrive on his own or with others?
i don't know .
keep going .
then i decided to give them all a rest from wonderful me ,
let them talk russian for a while .
there's a graveyard a couple of hundred yards up the hill .
lt's a place of pilgrimage .
lf there is to be hope , we must all betray our countries .
ah , dante , old chum .
come to pay your respects to old boris , have you?
boris pasternak .
do you think he knows people are allowed to read him again?
all victims are equal .
none is more equal than others .
yes , well , ... some write better than others .
how sweet it is to hate one's native land , to desire its ruin , and in its ruin to discern the dawn of universal rebirth .
pasternak?
no .
pecherin .
an earlier poet .
pecherin understood that it's possible to love your country while hating its system .
lf you say so .
i love my country .
l love it too your country .
and i'm reasonably fond of my own .
to save it , perhaps it's necessary to betray it .
yes?
because you and i , we love truth .
who are you , dante?
what do you do for a living?
i am a moral outcast .
oh , it's always nice to meet a writer .
and what sort of rubbish are you turning out now?
lies .
i am the lie .
really?
you spoke the truth .
promise me that you are not a spy , and then i will make you a promise in return .
i'm not a spy , actually .
not my line .
you are nobody's spy?
not even ours?
dante , i'm getting a bit jumpy , to be honest .
i'm nobody's spy .
let's talk about something else .
how about chess?
oh , chess . ln chess there are no lies .
but in my game lies are everything .
what game is that?
the soviet knight is dying inside his armour .
you are in danger only from our lies .
i commit the lie every day .
i lie even to my masters .
so , promise me that if i ever find the courage to think like a hero , then you will act like a merely decent human being .
right?
dante , leave me out , will you?
hey , you cannot reject me .
because i am strengthened by your rejection .
so , promise me .
what the hell am i promising , for god's sake?
promise .
all right .
lf you ever manage to be a hero ,
i'll be a ... decent human being .
ok?
promise?
i promise .
why didn't you come to us? !
i know why .
you put your head in the sand .
don't know because don't want to know .
i'm sorry , but we're going to need your rather serious help .
then i asked him " what am i supposed to be promising , for god's sake?
why didn't you come to us? !
i know why .
you put your head in the sand .
don't know because don't want to know .
who the hell is that?
walter?
he's a character .
l'm sorry , but we're going to need your rather serious help .
that's it .
and the notebooks?
the notebooks don't mesh with any disinformation artist , con man or intelligence peddler we know .
our psychology and handwriting gurus tried to fault them .
and?
they failed .
try harder , russell .
no .
no .
no .
not even a perhaps or a maybe?
no .
not even a tickle , old boy .
they're not in dante's class .
all right .
ls that katya?
that's her .
you remember her now?
no such luck .
choose someone else .
we didn't choose you .
dante did .
because i wasn't a spy .
we're not asking you to build the beastly rockets or push the button .
only to help improve our knowledge of the enemy .
and if the enemy turns out to be a friend , where's the harm?
i thought we were all supposed to be chums together now .
oh , my dear lord !
because this year it suits them to roll over and play nice doggie?
because this year they're on the floor anyway?
you ninny .
all the more reason to spy the daylights out of 'em .
kick 'em in the balls every time they get to their knees .
well , that's where i disagree .
i'll back my russia against yours any time .
nah .
i'm sorry , ned .
no go .
bloody woman .
i must've given offence .
she has a point .
worry about dante .
he reached out for you .
would you rather throw him to the americans?
don't be fooled by bob's yaley manner .
the yanks will take dante , put him on a spit and have a barbecue .
how will you live with yourself?
l don't live with myself .
ln fact , i try to give myself a wide berth .
i'm offering you a fresh start .
and a fat cheque .
never mind the money .
barley's far too grand .
this is something people write in for .
the chance to be an active player in the defence of their country .
you live in a free society .
you've no choice .
any decent church would've burnt you bastards years ago .
you're a fool to use me .
i let people down .
abercrombie and blair .
ls it the office of ...
mr bartholomew scott blair?
yes .
but he isn't in at the moment .
can i help , or would you like to leave a message?
no , thank you .
it is a publishing matter .
i will telephone again .
thank you .
crowds are good , if you keep moving .
open spaces are good .
talking in the street is ok , if you have to .
never , never talk in a car or in your hotel room , except for the benefit of their microphones .
lf you've read anything about playing the radio or running the taps , forget it .
that's right .
the source is the star of the show .
and the star decides whether to make the meeting or abort .
this is fun . ls that why you keep it secret?
did you spot our watchers?
the tramp raiding the dustbin , the woman with the white shoes , and , of course , the man with the tracksuit .
you scored nil .
out of a possible 1 2 .
the lesson is you'll never know who they are .
lf you need to write something down , use a single sheet of paper on a hard surface .
that leaves no impression .
how many such surfaces can you see in this room?
well , including the windowsill ... four .
seven .
this is often easiest .
then wipe it clean rubbing hard .
the issue is why .
that's what you're looking for all the time .
lf we trust the motive , we trust the man .
then we can trust the material .
why did dante pick on katya?
why does he put her life at risk?
why does she let him?
ls she a spy?
it's voice activated , sir .
you switch ...
i know all this .
i've had it up to here .
i just want to get it done .
what's the hold up?
it's everything we ever wanted to know about russia and were afraid to ask .
sounds like the pot of gold .
sounds like a crock of shit .
some unidentified walk in is telling us the russians are way behind , they can't hurt us , we can pull in our horns .
who the hell is gonna sell that story on the hill?
russell?
it could turn around and bite us right in the ass .
let the brits run with it for a while .
dante is their source , and , uh ...
scott blair is their problem .
i'll go with that , russell .
but i want joe and larry with him in london .
friendly observers , ok?
you'll do us proud , barley .
i've brought you a present .
it's not to keep .
it's just to sniff .
am i supposed to offer to publish it?
offer him anything he wants .
say anything you need to say to keep him with us .
except the truth?
bon voyage , barley .
come back with the goods on dante , starting with his real name , and i'll get you a knighthood for literature .
the russia house .
barley scott blair .
abercrombie and blair?
london .
the publishers .
i believe you know niki landau .
yes .
well , niki was very insistent that i should give you a call .
how do you do?
how do you do?
i'll tell you why i'm calling .
i'm here in moscow .
and niki's sent you about a ton of tea .
well , a couple of pounds .
i hope you like tea .
i was wondering if we could arrange a handover .
a handover?
do you ever escape for lunch?
yes .
of course .
well , how about today?
i'm at the ukraine hotel .
that would be convenient .
good .
marvellous .
well , i'll be outside from 1 2 . 30 on .
how will i know you?
oh , listen , i'm easy to recognise .
i look like a large , unmade bed with a shopping bag attached .
we're off .
hi .
hello .
you're katya , of course .
yes .
and you must be mr barley .
yes , indeed .
the same .
well done .
well , er ... where shall we go?
i brought your stuff from niki , but i'll carry it .
how did you recognise me , mr barley?
well , niki said you were russia's answer to the venus de milo .
that is ridiculous .
i was nearly arrested here three years ago .
they said i was photographing a military subject .
and were you?
no .
a soldier and his girlfriend .
they asked me to take their picture .
obviously i received the manuscript .
i will take you to where we can have lunch .
lf you do not mind , i will first buy shoes .
shoes?
today there is a shipment of shoes .
with perestroika , there is even less available than before .
really?
i thought things were improving .
everything is corrupt and incompetent .
perhaps different people are now stealing .
i don't know .
keep your voice down .
complaining is our new human right .
glasnost gives everyone the right to complain and accuse , but it doesn't make more shoes .
tell me about your new russian book .
oh , yes .
the book .
well , my problem is that , er , i don't know the author's real name ,
let alone where he gets all his information from .
learned his craft and so forth .
hm?
such personal questions are not appropriate .
some writers can only work in obscurity .
but you know publishing , hm?
lf a fella's written about the hill tribes of northern burma , well , you're entitled to know if he's ever been further south than minsk .
especially if it's a really important book .
which this one is .
dynamite , in fact .
the author was inspired by certain opinions of a british publisher concerning world peace .
do you think he'd like to meet that publisher again?
it is not known .
this can be established .
the publisher would like to meet him again .
how long are you staying in moscow , please , mr barley?
seven days , ...
mrs katya .
where do you live?
with my children .
your children?
how many?
i have a boy and a girl .
they are eight and nine years old .
it is not relevant .
what does your husband do?
it is not important .
ls he a publisher too?
no .
ls he a writer?
no .
a composer?
a cook?
ls he a dressmaker in vladivostok?
his factory prefabricates houses for rural areas .
we are divorced .
like everybody else in moscow .
unfortunately , i have to return to my children now .
lsn't someone looking after them?
well , ring up .
tell them you've met a fascinating man that wants to talk literature to you all day .
i'm sorry .
i cannot .
oh , look , we've hardly met .
i need time .
i've got 10, 000 enormously serious things to discuss with a beautiful russian woman .
i don't bite , i don't lie ...
have dinner with me .
at least show me something of moscow .
it is not convenient .
then give me your home number .
it is not convenient .
will you call me , then?
perhaps .
when?
perhaps i shall call you late tonight .
no , not " perhaps " .
i shall call you .
you forgot to give her the tea .
mr blair , sir?
wicklow .
excellent morning's work , sir .
no problems .
oh , by the way , you asked why so many russians use the word " convenient " .
ln russian it's " udobno " .
but it also means " proper " .
a bit confusing really .
yes , it is indeed .
we have an interim , sir .
katya left her office , took a taxi , unknown destination .
we have it covered .
da?
da , eta alina .
dobry dyen .
barley !
welcome to moscow , my dear chap !
alik .
why do you look so healthy?
why have you no hangover?
are you in love?
how did you know , alik?
meet leonard carl wicklow , our new editor of soviet books .
alik zapadny of vaap , the all suffocating soviet copyright agency .
how is barley paying you , mr wicklow?
oh , russia's top of the pops these days .
mention to the money boys that we want to build up a russian list and they throw money at us .
have you a sales force , or are you still relying on divine intervention?
and how about translators?
on fiction we will use our own and take another 5 % royalty .
how's that?
we'll consider it .
no , i don't think so .
we don't have the margin .
exactly .
well done , wickers .
jesus , barley !
yuri .
what are you doing here?
you're a month early for the book fair .
yuri , i want you to meet len wicklow , our new russian speaking specialist .
hello .
you a spy?
only in my spare time , sir .
jesus , i like him .
oh , thank you .
sit down , friend .
let's deal direct , ok?
to hell with those assholes at vaap .
stay away from them .
especially zapadny .
i don't say he's kgb .
all i say is he needed some damned good friends to get him back into circulation .
know what i mean?
cheers .
na zdorovye .
oh , barley ...
i have something for you .
some of these writers haven't yet been to jail .
but i'm working on it .
i'll make them famous in the west even if it kills them .
it's me .
do i disturb you?
deeply .
come over .
you invited me to show you moscow tomorrow , i think .
i did .
where do i send the glass coach?
i have the tapes , and i've never heard such pussyfooting around in my life !
barley has gotta tell katya : no more greta fucking garbo .
and dante better shit or get off the pot .
l'm being pelted with crap in the streets here !
all right , russell , message understood .
brock?
russell's metaphors are becoming rather scatological .
signal paddy at the embassy .
i want him to talk to barley .
er , we're this way .
i hope you like churches .
ln russia we don't ask that .
it is not convenient .
ah .
i think you mean " proper " .
no?
proper?
mm .
nyet .
convenient .
now you know why hardly anyone comes up here .
mind your head .
one more to go .
this way .
this is just like school .
dear old , bloody old ... school .
who is that man down there?
oh , he's my editor .
he's keeping lookout .
are we ready?
thank you , brock .
why is an editor keeping a lookout?
well ...
do you drink this stuff?
no .
me neither .
what's dante's real name , huh?
who is he?
does he test things?
ls he a physicist?
an engineer? ls he army?
does he like ice cream?
does he like the movies?
ls he one man? ls he two? ls he a group?
why don't you just start talking and let's see how it goes?
come on , katya .
you started this , i didn't .
come on , it's me , barley blair .
i do jokes , i do bird noises , i drink .
i'm a friend .
who is he?
i don't know what i may tell you .
what did he tell you to tell me?
whatever is necessary .
that i should trust you .
he was generous .
it is his nature .
why did you send me the book if you didn't trust me?
it was for him that i sent it .
i did not select you , he did .
oh .
he is ... my friend .
ls this what you usually do for friends?
smuggle their manuscripts out to the west?
risk your life , your children?
does he understand the consequences?
does he care?
he is reconciled .
are you?
of course .
and your children?
it is for them and their generation .
he is inspired by the new openness here .
but he knows that nothing will change by itself .
and you agree?
yes !
and so do you !
you spoke for him .
it is for you we are here !
that's worth a drink .
he is not a soldier .
he is a scientist .
he is a physicist .
also qualified in aspects of engineering .
better !
ha ha !
engineering .
we're making progress , gentlemen .
where was he trained?
he went to the lltmo .
afterwards to postgraduate studies at the university .
what's the lltmo?
leningrad lnstitute of mechanical and optical science !
write that down , fellas .
lltmo is the leningrad lnstitute for mechanical and optical science .
he was extremely brilliant .
at 1 4 he won a mathematics olympiad .
mathematics .
when i was at school , they were the people i couldn't stand .
naturally , if you are not so intelligent , you will be jealous .
from university he went to academgorodok , the city of science at novosibirsk .
he was ... like a meteor there .
ls that where you met him?
no !
ln leningrad .
i was a child .
a great intellectual of 16 .
i met yakov at the club ...
yakov?
yakov is dante?
yes .
yakov .
first name yakov !
jacky .
we met at the club of scientists .
it was at a closed showing of a foreign film .
lt was by godard .
bout de souffle .
breathless .
i went with my father .
and what year are we talking about now?
1 968 .
you remember '68?
the paris students at the barricades , american students against vietnam , and for us it was czechoslovakia .
yakov said that the russians would never stop the extraordinary reforms happening there .
it was the start of a new age .
he had come back to leningrad to be a part of it .
from where?
from the military .
they had seduced him with privileges , money for his researches ...
they had corrupted him .
he had come back to leningrad to recover his innocence .
he was beautiful .
not like a scientist , like an ... artist .
so you fell in love with him .
he was my first lover .
it was the same night that the tanks entered prague .
there was no more innocence anywhere .
yakov said that innocence was a delusion .
and a few weeks later he returned to the military .
i did not talk to him for many years .
until last year , when he met a british publisher who spoke to his heart .
next day , yakov telephoned me at the office .
he had decided what he must do .
he needed my help .
ls he alone in this?
does he need anyone else's help?
no .
none of his drinking friends?
no .
how can you be so certain?
because i am certain that in his thoughts he is completely alone .
are you happy with him?
please?
i mean , er ... do you like him?
as well as loving him .
does he make you laugh?
hm?
i believe that yakov is a great and important man , who is trying to restore himself and cannot survive without me .
oh .
jesus christ , mother of god !
it's savelyev !
yakov yefremovich savelyev !
did he mention anything about , er ... falsification of results?
he talks about " the great lie " .
everything is part of the great lie .
ah .
go on .
are you part of the great lie also , barley?
what?
i think i am also allowed to ask questions .
oh , of course .
ask .
are you mr bartholomew scott blair?
aw , for god's sake ...
are you?
yes .
are you a publisher?
yes .
are you a spy?
no .
are you alone in this , or were you sent by others?
answer her .
i'm alone .
jesus !
fuck .
i'm alone , and that's the god's truth .
never been more alone .
yakov said he will meet you in leningrad in four days from now .
he has proposed three places and three times .
he will keep one of the appointments , if he can .
good .
reconstruction .
openness .
he's going to reconstruct the balance of terror , and open the ultimate can of worms .
savelyev? !
my god , if dante is savelyev , you guys don't know what you've got !
yes , we do .
trouble .
yakov savelyev is the right hand of god over there .
and he says it's shit?
the soviet threat's one big lie?
and look at this .
they're bullshitting the kremlin .
honour is due , ned .
russell , i need your money .
and your love .
i want an american partner for barley .
i want him in leningrad on friday .
i hear you , ned .
i'll get right back to you .
lf he says they can't hit nevada on a clear day , you better believe it .
and be joyful .
joyful?
most of our customers come to this town with contracts to bring peace and prosperity to the arms industry for the next 50 years .
but how the fuck do you peddle an arms race when the only asshole you've got to race against is yourself?
the night train to leningrad .
i may have mentioned mr potomac books , my new american partner?
well , he's doing leningrad , and he summoned me for a powwow .
powwow?
i thought you knew english .
powwow " is not english .
you must sit down .
sit down?
why?
it is our custom before a long journey first to sit down .
well , i'm lying down .
won't that do?
well , ... you are supposed to sit on your luggage and sigh a little and cross yourself .
hold everything .
ok .
i was more comfortable lying down .
are you coming back to moscow?
no , not this time .
i have to fly straight back to school .
school?
work .
england .
it's a stupid expression of mine .
i hope i didn't bore you last night .
you did not bore me .
oh .
perhaps next time .
i'll make a special journey just to talk about myself .
i wish you a good journey , barley .
i'll miss you .
i want you to know something , scott .
this little country is on the move .
i smell hope here .
i smell change .
i smell commerce .
and we are buying ourselves a piece of it .
i'm proud .
proud .
0800 hours .
barley and wicklow are in leningrad .
checked in at the pribaltiyskaya hotel .
good .
we're on schedule .
barley's got three chances to make contact .
now it's up to dante .
you want to sell me something?
cigarettes , scotch , drugs , currency?
no , thanks .
cheerio .
you get lost?
that's a good idea .
why don't you try it?
one down , two to go .
where are you , dante?
sir .
excuse me , sir , but i think we are acquainted .
good god !
the great dante , as i live and breathe !
we met at that writer's party at peredelkino , remember?
the only two sober people there .
how are you?
i'm very well .
welcome to leningrad .
you can walk a little?
it is safest to keep moving .
yes , they told me that .
barley's made contact !
he's done it .
unfortunately , he couldn't find me .
so he gave it to our authorities .
people of ... discretion .
experts .
you have betrayed me .
nobody's betrayed you .
i told you .
your manuscript went astray , that's all .
our authorities admire your book .
but they need to know if it's true .
the best way would be for you to talk with them .
you came to tell me you refuse to publish me?
dante , you're going too fast .
russia has no time .
when the ice is thin , you have to walk fast .
to lose time is to lose everything .
and then we all slide into the grave .
so be it .
i will be the first corpse .
and katya second .
what about her?
she also chose .
lf we act together , we will survive together .
have you forgotten your words at peredelkino?
i am not the man you thought i was .
you do not need to remind me that man is not equal to his rhetoric .
our new people talk about openness .
disarmament .
peace .
words .
you like graveyards , barley?
look .
here is ours if we fail .
chose a monument .
