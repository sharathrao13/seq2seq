i'm getting 1 50 state troopers to fill in the blanks .
two hundred tomorrow .
governor glendening has committed emergency funds .
don't worry about o. t.
i wasn't going to .
what are we looking at?
hate crimes?
the guy's a world class misanthrope .
what do you mean?
he shoots men and women , minority and white .
hates everybody .
charles , we're not talking about terrorism?
i don't want to cry terrorist if this is just some asshole with a scope .
a little panic might make people cautious .
it might save some lives .
there's no such thing as a little panic .
not any more .
the chief looks nervous .
can you blame him?
the whole nation's watching .
nothing like this has ever happened in montgomery county .
our homicide rate just increased ... by 25 % in one day .
to the people in the d. c. metropolitan area ... be advised to be alert , be vigilant .
there's been no consistency in the people that have been targeted .
we are not able to assure anyone ... their safety at this time .
chief , are you exploring connections to terrorism?
sir , we are a large ... suburban community , adjacent to our nation's capital .
we're not gonna rule out any avenue at this time .
chief , are we dealing with a professional of some kind?
a trained sniper?
we do have someone that , so far ... has been very accurate at what they're attempting to do .
thank you .
children !
supper !
this murder spree began yesterday evening in maryland ... and continued today with four more shooting deaths .
police have launched a statewide manhunt .
last night the victim was a 55 year old man shot dead at a local market .
at 8 .
00 this morning , a second man was shot while mowing a lawn .
a short time later , a cab driver was killed while filling his taxi at a rockville gas station .
then a woman sitting at a post office ... and then a second woman shot down while cleaning her car .
police are urging the public to remain vigilant and alert .
every victim was doing the things each one of us does every day .
good eveni ng .
hey .
how are y'all doing?
good , good , good .
i was wondering if we can get a get a locker .
would that be a family membership?
sure .
you have month to month?
mm hmm .
okay , that'll work .
this your boy?
yes .
what's your name , baby?
you can tell her .
my name's john , ma'am , just like my father .
where's your island accent?
his mother's jamaican .
oh .
my blood's all red , white and blue .
uh , why don't you come on over here?
i'll take your picture .
come on .
stand right there .
oh , come on , baby .
smile for the camera .
do you want mine?
most definitely .
now , why don't you give me one of them smiles?
okay .
okay , let me run some things by you .
right , right , right .
do you remember seeing the box truck before or after chief moose announced it?
i'm sorry , but the chief won't be giving interviews .
all questions can be addressed through our public information office .
i'll know better within an hour .
thank you .
my office is getting calls .
scared people asking questions i can't answer .
what do they want to know?
they want to know how to be safe .
asking about instituting curfews .
they've killed at night .
they've killed during the day .
we can't ask a million people to hide indoors .
we have to define this , charles .
chief , i've got sandy .
we have to give it a name .
there is no name for it .
sandy?
hey , baby .
i'm back .
i'm home .
you okay?
yeah , yeah .
i'll be there as soon as i can .
all right .
chief !
special agent tremain from the f. b. i.
baltimore field office .
chief , we open the door to the feds , they are gonna ask us to step out .
don't worry, jacobs .
i reached out for the bureau .
this suburban beltway community normally offers safe haven ... from the crime and violence of the district .
but since the last shot rang out at 9 . 58 this morning ... montgomery county police have announced neither leads ... nor suspects in this series of random murders .
there are more questions tonight than there are answers .
paralysis has set in across this quiet suburban county .
citizens are behind locked doors , wondering if the horror has ended ... as abruptly as it started , wondering if this is all over  if it's safe to walk the street , buy gas or go shopping .
has some sleeper cell awakened ... in the shadow of our nation 's capital?
authorities will neither confirm nor deny that the shootings are terrorist related .
terror
you said one shot , chief .
are we dealing with a professional of some kind?
a trained sniper?
we do have ... someone ... that so far has been very accurate ... at what they're attempting to do .
the spectre of terrorism looms large in the mind of americans ... and it cannot be ignored .
this is connie kingston reporting live from rockville , maryland ... a city under siege .
oh !
oh !
chief ramsey had a shooting in the district last night .
day two 6 . 15 a. m.
if it's connected , that's six .
six people in 24 hours .
ai fagent russell stone d. c. metro turned the bullet fragments over to us this morning .
the fragments you've recovered so far have all been . 223s .
it's a common bullet .
several companies make it .
several weapons fire it .
we can't trace it?
you haven't found any shell casings .
we assumed he was collecting them .
or he's using a bolt action rifle ... and ejecting the shell casings later , or he's firing from inside his vehicle .
the shooting in d. c. does match the mo .
long range , one shot , no casings .
d. c. metro has a witness ... who saw a burgundy coloured chevy caprice leaving the scene .
african american driver .
f. b. i. speclal agent jack tremaln i don't think so .
spree killers skew white .
our profile says he's late 20s , early 30s , educated , divorced .
that matchesyesterday's description white box truck , white driver .
we're putting together a geographic profile .
most likely , he lives near where he kills .
he or they?
if this is a serial killer , okay , that's one thing .
but the press has chained this to anthrax and 9/ 1 1 .
long range assassination is a page out of al qaeda's playbook .
what if it's not osama bin laden?
what if it's timothy mcveigh?
we're looking into militia groups up and down the seaboard .
we're referencing that against weapons purchases
wait wait a minute .
referencing that against any members with weapons training .
lieutenant?
this guy , these guys , whatever the hell they are ... they haven't targeted government institutions or employees .
they haven't made any demands .
nobody's claimed any responsibility .
so if this is terrorism , what's the point?
what's the message?
fear .
okay , listen .
like i said  honey
stop worrying , mom .
stay inside .
you missed the bus .
oh , yeah .
i'll just ride my bike .
you got all your gear .
i'll drive you .
but i
i don't want you to miss homeroom .
i'll call you .
come on , guys .
i'm driving .
come on .
come on !
come on , come on .
push it !
push it !
push !
get it off of you !
push !

yeah !
good job !
that's what i'm talking about .
john , that's what i'm talking about .
allah akbar .
allah akbar .
if something should happen and a child gets hurt ...
montgomery county councll i couldn't live with myself ... knowing that we might have done something and did not .
we have done something .
the schools are under lockdown .
it's like living in a bunker eight hours a day .
kids are safer in school than out .
your kids too?
yes , my kids too .
absolutely .
how do we make an informed decision about the schools ... without something concrete from law enforcement?
the chief is giving us everything he can .
which ain't much .
i propose we shut 'em down .
close the schools until this is over .
and tell the kids what?
give up?
hide under your bed?
i'd rather see them scared than dead !
no one wants our children hurt .
it would only be as long as it takes to catch the bastard .
and how long will that be?
we don't know .
what if we don't catch him?
i guess we'll be looking for a new police chief .
the sheriff's department has verified ... that montgomery county schools remained ... under a code blue lockdown status today .
and there's talk of opening military bases so local school children ... can carry on with sporting events .
barri ng the apprehension of a suspect , they plan on keeping their children in this halloween .
theyjust don't want to take a chance .
we will release a composite image ... of a white box truck ... seen fleeing one of the crime scenes .
a white male was seen driving this vehicle .
that was chief charles moose ... speaking to reporters earlier today on some recent developments in the d. c.
we want you to start wearing a vest .
you gonna put a million vests on a million people in montgomery?
no .
then you're not putting one on me .
i want to assign a security detail in case in case
i'm telling people to go on with their lives .
doug , the feds have intel  i'm going out in public .

al qaeda's trained snipers to hit u. s. government officials .
you're the highest elected officer in the county .
they're killing civilians !

you're a rung up the ladder .
so are you .
i carry a gun .
i'm surrounded by people carrying guns .
i'm talking about two cops in street clothes .
rapid start collects the tips , tracks who's working the lead .
f. b. i. baltlmore fleld offlce
most of the operators are trainees , but we have experienced agents overseeing them .
did you take any flak opening the door to the feds?
murders in the district go federal .
you would have come in anyway .
we don't know d. c. 's connected yet .
yes , we do .
we just can't say it .
sniper tip line .
please state your name .
don't talk . just listen .
i want to talk to the policeman .
i need you to state your name , sir , before i take your information .
my name?
no , no .
you don't get that .
i i do " i have something for you .
you're looking for the wrong people .
i can't take any information unless you state your name first .
you're not listening .
please , just start with your name , okay?
okay .
call me god .
we got a possible .
george lenehan .
he's one of the sniper school rejects that fort bragg spat out of the computer .
what's he done since the army?
he's tied to a militia group brothers of the cross .
the rifle?
purchased a bushmaster in 200 1 , semi auto .
it shoots . 223s .
he was cited yesterday for speeding outside of thornburg , virginia .
that's spotsylvania county .
he's in the neighbourhood .
frederlcksburg , vlrglnia
what's that?
oh , my god !
i need help !
help me !
please !
chief , shooting in fredericksburg .

spotsylvanla county , vlrglnia

that's it !
hurry !
let's go !
let's go !
we interrupt this programme to bring you a fast breaking live exclusive ... on the d. c. sniper case .
our news team has learned federal law enforcement has converged on a hotel  what the hell?
it's not one of ours .
what you are seeing now is a live feed from our aerial camera .
go !
make your breach !
now !
well , there is a significant amount of police activity outside the hotel
now !
on the ground !
george lenehan , this is the f. b. i. !
come out with your hands up !
get down !
get down !
yes, yes !
it looks like they have him .
the suspect has been apprehended .
we are holding the man on a warrant ... unrelated to the crimes we've been discussing .
we have yet to make any connection ... between this man and the shootings .
day flve if and when we do ...
we will provide you with that information .
for now ... we have to stay vigilant .
check .
live your lives ... but be aware .
don't let your anxiety control you .
go to work .
go to school .
your children are safe at their schools .
that was chief moose now confirming that they do have a suspect in custody .
checkmate .
you didn't see that , did you?
you gotta see it , john .
you gotta see that .
you gotta focus .
free your mind .
free your mind .
i told you this 1 0 times already .
i returned that gun months ago .
yeah , i guess a bushmaster ... would be too much gun for a skinhead rednecks like yourself .
i can handle any weapon you name .
you're a regular shit head .
have we found it?
no .
he could have dumped the rifle in the potomac , chief .
i guess that's what they told you , huh?
why would he do that?
he didn't know we were coming .
we haven't had a shooting since we apprehended him .
yeah .
quiet weekend .
you can think about that a little bit longer ... then we'll come right back in here , or you can tell me where you set the gun !
hello?
it's me .
hey , you .
get any sleep last ni ght?
mm , yeah , yeah .
i'm good .
you coming home tonight?
you'll be in bed before i do .
i'll wait up .
charles , keep calling , even if it's just to say you can't make it home .
i will .
and tell your troops to do the same thing .
they need to call home ... even if it's just to say , " i can't talk .
charles?
charles?
i'm sorry , sandy .
i can't talk .
bowle , maryland
out of the building , please .
help !
the boy's aunt was just dropping him off .
a few people heard the shot .
no one saw the shooter .
thirteen .
he was 1 3 years old .
what the hell kind of sick bastard shoots a kid?
is he alive?
they took him to children's hospital .
police have closed down route 197 , which fronts the school .
traffic is crawling throughout the area .
it's total chaos here .
we've got parents trying to get into the area to get their kids ... home safe and sound .
police won 't comment on any connection to the sniper shootings ... but the mo looks to be the same : one shot , fired at a distance .
we may not have bin laden or timothy mcveigh .
no .
maybe david berkowitz .
dear mr policeman .
call me god .
do not release to the press .
get a fingerprint off that shell casing .
i doubt he'd plant clues and forget to wipe them clean .
it's the first time he's got out of his vehicle .
why , do you suppose?
i said they were safe .
i said the schools were safe .
he went outside his comfort range with the boy .
he went out of range on october 4 too , hasbro .
but i redesigned the profile for virginia , and then he comes back .
i don't know what variables are defining his kill zone .
it becomes more accurate the more samples it gets .
how many more samples you want?
october in the d. c. area is supposed to be a time for the outdoors .
the heat of the summer has melted away ... but this season a state of siege has paralysed the community .
its citizens are staying in , afraid to venture out .
student sporting events have been rescheduled or cancelled altogether .
high school teams are practising in their gyms ... uncertain when activities will resume ... uncertain when their lives will return to normal .
well , what makes this not just an american story but an international story
somebody like this could hold london to hostage ... or rome or paris or berlin .
the random shootings are especially shocking here in england ... where strict gun control limits gun ownership ... to a small minority of the population , usually farmers .
but gun related violence is on the rise here ... and there is much empathy for those in the d. c. area .
i'm from san diego , and even though we're all the way on the other coast ... we're we're nervous around here too .
cllnton , maryland i have two kids , and i don't even want to leave the house any more .
i live in phoenix , arizona , and i'm afraid to buy gas .
calls are coming in from not only the east coast ... but the west coast , the southern states , the pacific northwest .
the towers , then the anthrax and now this ... and you wonder , is there a line they won't cross?
i. d. , ma'am .
mildred muhammad .
okay .
i'll get you to pull ahead .
i'll radio in for 'em .
red dots represent the victims .
red , orange , yellow and green should be where he lives .
correct .
the cable cops say he lives in the vicinity of his crimes .
and then he leaves it .
hits virginia .
you say the schools are safe  then he proves us wrong .
we're defining his kill zone .
our victims have all been innocent .
they have all been blameless and defenceless .
but today ... a line was crossed .
today ... it got down to the children .
and whether it was the person we're looking for ... or someone else  someone so cruel ... so mean spirited ...
to shoot a child ...
they've given our community a level of fear that we're not used to .
now , come on .
that's crossing the line .
our children don't deserve this .
i guess it's getting to be really , really personal now .
so , parents , please engage your children tonight .
be there for them .
tell them that they're safe .
they're gonna need that .
they've got to hear that from you .
and tell them that we're gonna ... carry on .
we will carry on ...
because that's what we do in this country .
that is what we do .
that , of course , was chief moose ... of the montgomery county police department ... speaking earlier today , emotional ... clearly upset over the shooting of a 1 3 year old boy in suburban maryland .
law enforcement officials are
i'm supposed to be all facts and evidence .
i go out there , i shed a tear .
he sees that .
he sees
he sees he got to me .
he goes out and he does it again .
detective paulson ... my sources in prince george say that the sniper left a calling card .
you enjoying this?
bad news is good news , and good news is bad for business .
the message was on a tarot card .
the death card?
mmm .
what'd it say?
are there any more cards?
happy hunting .
day seven
as we last reported , the child shot yesterday in maryland ... at the benjamin tasker middle school was undergoing surgery ...  at children's hospital .
hey , you up?
i'm told he's out of the operating room after several hours of intense work ... by the county's top surgeons .
but there's been no information as to his status .
we will continue to track this story and bring you updates as we get them .
and if you've just joined us ... there's been a very unsettling update on the sniper case .
a calling card was left with the haunting message ...
" hello , mr policeman .
i am god .
oh , no .
sources say that the message then went on ... to warn the police not to release the card or its contents to the press .
the card , the tarot death card ...
what have they done?
represents the sniper's first attempt to communicate with police .
king george four .
king george four .
king george four .
king george four , concerned that your contact
chevy chase village , you can phone him on two .
chevy chase village  you all ri ght , sir?
uh , sorry , officer .
y eah , i'm okay .

i just needed 40 wink .

two one zebra .
registration current .
registered to john allen williams .
bang !
get in , sniper .
the tragedies continue to mount in maryland and virginia .
the sniper or snipers have taken the life of yet another victim .
this is the ninth shooting and seventh murder since october 2 .
police collected evidence at a manassas , virginia , sunoco station ... where the man was shot down while filling his tanks ... but have come away with no leads to follow .
this is the third shooting at a gas station .
meanwhile , developments continue to come in ... on monday's shooting at benjamin tasker middle school .
mlster pollce man , i am god " the tarot card , the death card , which may have been left by the sniper ... is said to have included a warning to police .
task force sources say the message explicitly told law enforcement ...
day nlne not to release the card to media outlets .
you have to blame the press before the sniper blames us .
he's the only constant the community has .
he's the face of this investigation .
the face of the investigation can't go off half cocked .
he has every right to give them hell .
it's an issue of trust .
you can do this , chief .
you have a passionate history .
i'll see you all down there .
you attack the press today ... tomorrow all the stories are gonna be about your temper ... and your problems in portland .
did you talk to the county heads about running a dragnet?
charles , let me do this .
is everyone on board?
let me do this conference .
is everyone on board?
county , state and federal .
you know it has to come from me .
i'm the policeman .
as far as i know , the people in my community ... have asked the police department to work this case .
so i beg of the media , let us do our job !
if the community wants you to do it ... they will call today and we will have a vote .
and if it's decided ... that channel 9 or the washington post ... is going to investigate this case , so be it .
you need to fill your airtime and write your columns ... so you make up news where there is none .
each one of you is so hell bent on beating the competition ... that you make public information ... that could , at best , jeopardize the investi gation ... or , at worst ... jeopardize lives .
frederlcksburg , vlrglnia
okay , we are ... set .
sit tight .
got it .
all right , look .
traffic's clear .
all clear .
take your time .
free your mind .
free your mind, john .
free my mind .
say it again .
free my mind .
say it again .
free my mind .
allah akbar .
we are conducting a police investigation .
if you are driving a white van or white truck  there's a dragnet going on up and down the beltway here .
they've got all the off ramps and the on ramps closed off ... and they are checking all white box trucks .
open up the back .
uh , white vans .
there was a report that it might be a light coloured chevy astro .
well , today they're taking no chances whatsoever .
they're stopping any vehicle that even closely resembles that description ... and they're , of course , asking for all the identifying paperwork ... for anybody in that vehicle .
i repeat , you want to stay clear of the beltway .
the traffic here is at a complete standstill ... as state and local authorities are searching vehicle to vehicle ... in pursuit , of course , of these killers or killer .
and , as i repeat , there are now 1 0 victims in a week's time .
hand me the map , john .
let's go !
if you are driving a white van or a white truck
we had another shooting death on the ninth in manassas ... another today in frederickssburg .
we locked down the interstate .
we backed up traffic for 50 miles .
maryland law enforcement brleflng
as of this moment , we've come up empty handed .
day ten
well , what if what if we're talking about more than one here?
snipers work in two man teams .
a spotter and a shooter .
we've covered that .
that's not what i'm saying .
multiple teams .
maryland has one cell .
one in virginia .
but you're not answering the dragnet question .
how the hell do they get away?
multiple teams , multiple vehicles .
so we could be wrong on the truck .
maybe it's a white van or maybe it's one of the other vehicles .
we don 't really know .
with each passing day and with each murder ... the sniper or snipers become bolder and more ruthless ... but law enforcement is also upping the stakes .
a tally shows that 390 f. b. i. agents , 1 55 a. t. f. agents ... and other government agencies have nowjoined the task force ... which has also reached out to the pentagon ... requesting access to a military surveillance plane ... with high tech equipment capable of tracking gunfire on the ground .
in an interview , senator mccain offered ... supportive words for those terrorized by the recent spree ... of sniper murders .
he was less supportive of chief charles moose , saying ... " i've come to the conclusion that we need to have somebody in charge .
he went on to say that with over 1 , 000 federal agents ... already on the task force ... the person to be in charge , the person to look to
we've learned that back in portland , moose was criticized ... when protests outside his home over the closure of the city park turned violent .
as a patrolman , moose was disciplined four times for outbursts .
he was ordered to attend anger management classes ... to stem his rage .
despite these incidents , county executive doug duncan ... hired the chief back in 1 999 .
the latest sniper victim was a 53 year old man , kenneth bridges .
police are said to be working on a second composite sketch ... of a white van witnesses saw leaving the scene of this most recent shooting .
police are also going through hours of business surveillance cameras ... to find something , anything , that might lead to a break in the case .
the serial sniper has left eight dead and two wounded .
the most recent victims were shot at gas stations ... while filling their cars , going about their daily lives .

your incompetence has cost you ... another life .
they repeat the same threat they made in the ponderosa letter .
we should release it .
we owe it to the community .
we release , it rewards them , incites them .
they haven't acted on it yet .
no , they've acted on it .
of course .
on the seventh , they acted on it .
we can't incite them to do something they've already done .
put it out?
it's your call .
today president bush addressed the nation's fear and anxiety .
it makes me sick to my stomach .

uh , i i weep for those who've lost their loved ones .
i have said before that public safety is the priority .
we will not withhold information ... that might endanger the citizens ... of this community .
there was a postscript ... attached to the letter left at the ponderosa ... which i will now read .
your children ... are not safe ... anywhere ... at any time .
goddam it .

i don't know .

what the hell's in washington state?
belllngham , washlngton
llghthouse mlsslon homeless shelter
i rememberthe boy .
he had a gentle manner .
does this have something to do with his i. n. s. hearing?
or does this have something to do with john muhammad?
we might be looking at a two man team .
i met john and john at the " y.
we used to work out together .
his kid was nice , quiet .
he didn't say squat without john's permission .
i personally found it refreshing a kid today showing his old man respect .
john claimed malvo was his son or stepson .
it depended on who he was talking to .
but that boy , he never acted like a son .
he followed john like a zealot , took orders like a soldier .
john allen williams , also known as john allen muhammad .
two years ago he was splitting with his second wife , kidnapped his kids ... took them to antigua .
we think that's where he met malvo .
the boy followed him back to the states?
followed him clear across the country .
and back again .
john called the kid " sniper , " like a nickname .
i mean , he was teaching him how to shoot , and i thought
he taught the kid how to do everything how to work out , how to eat right .
the guy's a serial loser .
two failed marriages , two failed businesses we know about .
only time he's distinguished himself was in the army .
what did he do?
qualified as an expert on the rifle range .
he had these crazy ideas talked about blowing up oil tankers on the highway ... killing cops who showed up at the scene ... and blowing up the churches during the cops 'funerals .
sick stuff .
crazy , right?
we got a hit .
yeah , we got a it's a chevy caprice .
the colour's blue .
sweet mary .
that car's been red flagged in area one , two , three , four
no less than 1 0 times .
okay .
okay .
we gotta cast a wide net , but we've gotta do it quiet .
we need every county , state and fed cop looking for this car .
the team in washington where are they headed next?
after the shelter , they stayed with a friend from muhammad's gulf war company .
where?
tacoma .
with an update on the sniper story from tacoma , washington ... here isjohn demeeta .
authorities will neither deny nor confirm ... that this recent activity here in tacoma has some connection ... to the rash of murders on the other side of the country .
local f. b. i. locked down this tacoma home ... and have proceeded to perform a grid search of the yard with metal detectors ... as though they're looking for bullet fragments .
firefighters are also working to remove a pockmarked tree trunk ... which looks like it might have been used for target practice .
chief , if the press has tacoma , they have the names too .
screw the names .
if the snipers see this , they're in old mexico .
f. b. i. will load this trunk along with wood pile and rock debris ... and will ship it back to their lab in maryland .
would you tell my son i'm out at the car?
bad toothache .
ah , sure , baby .
i'll do that for you .
thank you .
appreciate it .
earliertoday , metal detectors were used ... to sweep the yard of this tacoma , washington address .
sources close to the sniper investigation have stated that there is something a suspect , a witness  something that links these two seemingly unrelated locations .
john !
it's okay .
he's just outside .
your daddy went to sit in the car .
tacoma famlly court tacoma , washlngton
beatrice jaffe?
uh , yes?
we're looking for information on a john allen muhammad .
he's the ex of one of my clients .

chief?
i know why he came here .
john?
john .

i gotta run to the store .
aaah !
god .
play nice , babies .
aaah !
they get to her in time?
yeah .
house is secure , the wife and kids are safe .
oh , my god .
i told sandy about the wheaton shooting when all this started .
she asked me ...
was it a domestic dispute?
is this just some guy gone around the bend because his wife got custody?
maybe that's how it started .
why'd he keep going?
why didn't he stop?
it's hard when you're made to feel you're the almighty .
john allen williams .
john allen williams is said to be travelling with his stepson, john lee malvo .
john allen williams
we go out with the make and model now , they're gonna dump that car .
you put the car out , it's easier for a citizen to spot .
tip line might get us there faster .
wouldn't we have to worry about a citizen taking the law into his own hands?
they are travelling in not a white box truck , not a white van ... but a blue 1990 chevrolet caprice .
we do now .
dad?
yeah .
what do we do now?
uh , let's just
let's just close our eyes for a while .
a federal arrest warrant has been issued ... for john allen muhammad ... also known as john allen williams .
muhammad should be considered armed and dangerous .
1 2 . 45 am he may be in the company of a juvenile .
day twenty two do not approach them .

here's one with a wild hair .
