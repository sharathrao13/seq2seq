sentinels .
damn it .
we were headed for junction 21 like you ordered .
robbie picked up the signals we're confirming the hr scans .
we weren't sure what to do .
the readings don't make any sense .
they read like sentinels .
but there's thousands of them .
directly above us .
is that possible?
we got company .
they don't look happy to see us .
get us out of here .
we're cut off !
there's an intersection .
it's uncharted .
take it !
get to the gun turrets !
right .
come get some .
hang on .
i've never seen the surface .
it's nothing now but one big graveyard .
oh , my god .
it's an army .
what is that thing?
some kind of tunneling machine .
oh , no .
what?
look where we are .
what's four kilometers straight down?
zion .
go .
go .
go !
zion .
zion has to be warned !
how?
someone had to get to a drop point .
what?
are you crazy?
we can't broadcast now !
we have to .
i'll go .
there isn't much time .
i'll make it .
you know , i peeked .
so did i.
goodbye , thadeus .
goodbye , jue .
fly , baby , fly !
come on !
pardon me .
i'm sorry .
i was in my own little world .
is it important?
very .
i hope it gets where it's supposed to go .
me too .
these days you never know .
no , you never do .
goodbye .
goodbye .
thadeus .
