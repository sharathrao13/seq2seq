wake up .
baby's spotted two machines heading in fast .
i see them .
they're runners .
think you can handle them?
watch me .
okay .
i'm in .
that runner's smarter than we've seen so far .
it's quite a catch .
thanks .
will it ...?
do you think it'll convert?
to convert is its choice to make .
do you think maybe we ought to reprogram it?
no .
we can't make slaves of them .
because that would be simpler .
we won't beat the machines by making them our slaves .
better to let them join us by choice .
make them believe the right choice is the one we want them to make .
all right .
yes , machines are tools .
they're made to be used .
it's their nature .
to be slaves .
that's why we can show them a better world , why they convert .
but that world we show them isn't real .
it doesn't matter .
i'm afraid they'll figure out that we've made up the thing in our heads .
they can't tell the difference .
to an artificial mind , all reality is virtual .
how do they know that the real world isn't just another simulation?
how do you?
i know i'm not dreaming now because i know what it's like being in a dream .
so dreaming lets you know reality exists .
no .
just that my mind exists .
i don't know about the rest .
okay , he's good to go .
looks like we are too .
dreaming already?
he's had a rough day .
you poor baby .
would you mind?
not at all .
hello there .
what's happening?
sentinels .
let's go !
come on , damn it , help me !
