look at me .
i 'm all right .
oh , i got a crowd .
little indigestion .
too many peanuts on the plane .
i 'm ok .
thank you for your concern .
he 's had a little problem .
whoa .
don 't don 't don 't don 't you do that to me .
walter , that 's pushing it too far .
now , you listen to me .
now , you pay attention to me right now .
there 's no such thing as too far .
understand?
you push everything as far as you can .
you push and you push and you push until it starts pushing back and then you push some goddamn more .
remember that when you 're with this guy today .
ok?
oh , man .
if i start to die again , forget the hospital , i wanna croak here .
walter .
mr. novian , it 's an honor .
my associate ...
john anthony .
how are you?
these sports services of yours ... complete fucking scam , huh?
i hear your boy here 's having quite a season .
what 's your system , walter?
system?
let 's start with how much you bet .
million a game , across the board .
ok , is that the most we 're working with?
it depends .
shit , benny , check your wallet .
see if you have any cash .
maybe he 'll talk about the weekend .
how do you feel about it?
do you rent that yacht?
no , no .
i own it .
well , that 's how i feel about this weekend .
and i 'm not being cocky .
i 'm talking straight commerce with you , mr. novian .
i didn 't come down here to bullshit you .
wow , you got steamed .
or maybe a little inside information , maybe?
i know these teams better than they know themselves .
i 'm going 12 for 12 this weekend including the monday night parlay .
wow .
should we believe him?
what do you think?
i don 't believe him .
you cannot afford not to .
no , i can afford .
can you?
honest question , mr. novian .
can you?
hell , can anyone , for that matter , afford to lose as much as a man like you needs to bet to actually feel a win?
winning 's a funny thing .
it 's one of those rare commodities that money cannot buy , until you called me .
i didn 't call you .
i called your boss .
and he called me .
the price is $250, 000 up front , plus 10 % of every game you win .
well , that 's wild .
i never paid up front before , did i?
we 've never charged it before .
considering whose picks you 're getting , and the amount of money you 're betting , 250 's a bargain .
you know it and i know it .
if you want this weekend 's winners , that 's my offer .
you can take it or leave it .
let 's step outside .
come in .
they need it , mr. anthony .
what 's your mother 's name , mitchell?
sheila .
what street did you grow up on?
atlantic avenue .
who do you like monday night?
oh , i don 't know .
pick one .
well , that 's your job .
i 'll do your job tomorrow .
today you do mine .
who do you like?
what are you talking about?
mitchie .
seattle v new orleans .
stop stalling .
who do you like?
i don 't know .
i mean , i guess i like seattle , plus the two points .
over or under?
no , you can 't ...
don 't ...
you can 't do that .
no , i can do this .
over or under?
it 's 44 points .
come on .
um ...
over .
seattle in the over .
nice .
i won 't hand that in .
a million dollars are riding on that game .
oh , there 's a whole lot more than that .
we all know i can pick .
today i 'm picking you .
the outcome will be the same .
ok .
and ... what if i 'm wrong?
there 's no " if .
are we running to the field goal?
we don 't need a field goal .
we need a touchdown .
oh , that 's ok .
that 's ok .
they score , we win .
come on , come on .
they score , we win .
they score , we win .
they score , we win .
they score , we win .
they score , we win .
... first down on the sixth .
touchdown !
yes !
we won !
we won !
a hundred fucking percent !
a hundred fucking percent !
a hundred fucking percent !
a hundred ... (?
it's not unusual " by tom jones )
it was like he mesmerized me a little bit .
like spock or something , i visualized it .
seattle and the over and he wrote it down .
he said picking me was like him doing it .
how long have you been here?
?
it's not unusual to go out at any time
congratulations , brandon , or should i say john?
either way , it 's amazing .
i am very impressed .
are you kidding me?
letting salesmen make your picks?
that 's balls .
you better get over there and collect some of that cash right now .
the way you 're picking , you 'll need some for a rainy day .
enjoy it while it lasts .
gambling gods are a fickle bunch .
so easily offended .
there might be businesses you can make over two million dollars in a weekend ...
thanks for looking after me .
all right . ... but will somebody tell me , somebody please tell me , where else are you gonna have this much fucking fun?
you the man !
you the man , big papa !
i love you forever .
let me ask you something .
how much of that do re mi be for moi?
well , how about a one with five zeros behind it .
a hundred thousand?
yeah .
on two mill?
you be working out of my shop .
yes , sir , i am .
look around you .
this is your place , walter 's shop .
i understand that .
i 'm just saying , feed the horse , baby .
maybe 10 % .
10 %?
that what you 're thinking?
that 's a beautiful thought .
forget it .
walter , we were starting to roll here .
and we got novian .
we got the 250 grand ...
i wanna tell you something now , ok?
i 'm gonna say it only once .
if you want something more from me than a gesundheit after a sneeze ,
you have to do more than this shit .
you understand?
you 're gonna have to earn it .
once you earn it , you 'll have to fight me for it .
you 'll have to challenge me .
you 'll have to rip it out of my fucking talons .
that 's how you get ahead with me .
now , john anthony would know that , see?
as a matter of fact , next time you come to me with this shit ,
you come as john anthony .
i ain 't talking money with you .
(?
you're nobody 'til somebody loves you " by dean martin )
hey , big winner , huh?
how you feeling?

oh !

i 'm thinking of buying a plane .
oh , yeah .
yeah .
you know ...
don 't laugh .
a big one .
one of them g ...
g somethings .
i saw this house in the bahamas for sale .
i mean , talk about an investment .
in case anything should happen to me , i mean , you and julia ...
shh !
i don 't wanna hear that , walter .
stop that .
why don 't we go down and check it out?
just you and me , barefoot in the sand .
just tell me you 're not ... gambling , walter .
oh .
18 years , i 'm straight , ok?
that shit 's over .
it 's never over .
you know that , walter .
it 's never over .
how about a truth serum ... in the veins?
baby , we just made two million dollars .
i wanna just celebrate with my wife .
i want to enjoy a dance .

walter .
alexandria?
hey , it's brandon .
yeah .
yeah , listen , i happen to be in the neighborhood .
you have got a doberman for a doorman .
hi , alexandria .
what are you doing here?
what do you say we go out for a late night dinner right now?
have a couple killer bottles of wine , go back to that place where we first met ...
hm?
are you out of your mind?
i live in this building , asshole .
this is home .
i don 't appreciate you stopping by without calling .
whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa .
what 's gotten into you?
i 'll make this shit real clear , so this doesn 't happen again .
you meant 5, 000 bucks .
your friend set it up .?
the world still is the same?
you never change it?
as sure as the stars shine above?
well , you're nobody?
till somebody loves you?
so find yourself?
somebody to love
you know what time it is?
it is 8 : 37 in the a . m .
wrong .
it 's time to press , my man .
we 're gonna yank out all the stops .
when you 're winning , you press .
you don 't rest on your laurels .
what are you doing?
i 've got a 10 : 30 tee time at wingfoot with a client that howell guy .
so don 't call me unless the lines change .
the salmon are running , my man .
you gotta stay here .
gotta field phone calls .
you can 't go out playing golf , having fun .
fun?
seor , you have obviously never played wingfoot .
come on , stop playing around here .
let 's go .
you got work to do this week .
i 'm not asking you if i can leave , walter .
i 'm telling you that 's how it is .
all right?
you want my picks , i can give you those .
washington minus eight against miami , washington .
saint louis , kc .
out of your mind?
las vegas .
you 're gonna start picking on tuesday for the weekend , huh?
philadelphia .
i love it .
look at that .
cinci .
we 'll be advising in the neighborhood of 20 million dollars this week .
that 's a nice neighborhood .
we should be doing double that by week ten .
i see .
you 're gonna make the picks .
no study , no analysis .
you 're just gonna pick 'em .
locked in , walter .
i don 't really need it .
look at that .
you 've got to be kidding me .
vegas , monday night .
there 's my picks for this week .
now , if you want next week 's picks , i can give you those by friday .
if you wanna join us , you can .
no , i 'm getting the drift .
tell you what .
we 'll keep these on ice and go over 'em tomorrow .
i won 't be in tomorrow .
well , then , the next day !
uh , we 'll talk about it .
hey , brandon !
toni !
hey !
where you headed?
some of us have to work .
oh , oh , oh .
there we go .
baby .
hey , you look great .
nice ride .
" 900 k l n g . " did you see the plates?
yes , i did .
you feel that?
you feel that?
don 't .
slow down , brandon .
oh , this car was made to go fast .
no .
not with me in it .
slow down .
loosen up , will you?
hey .
let me ask you a question .
when you 're not at the salon , or running julia to play dates , or keeping walter in line , which i know is a full time job , what do you do for you?
i stay busy .
you 're gonna turn here , so ...
that 's not what i asked .
what do you do for you , for toni?
i was a junkie , brandon .
ok?
so every day i get up and i wonder , " is this the day?
is this the day i slip , end up back on the street?
just keeping it all on track , that 's what i do for me .
well , that 's not living , toni .
that is not living .
that is maintaining .
that 's cashing in .
that is not living .
what the hell does that mean?
are we talking perfection?
you wanna talk perfection?
no .
nobody 's perfect .
oh , except for me last weekend , going 14 and 0 , huh?
this is your stop .
well , thanks for the ride ...
john .
in other action , washington melted down in miami , losing 24 to 12 .
saint louis shocked kc 34 14 , and philadelphia smacked pittsburgh 23 10 .
i 'm gonna go work out .
no , you 're not .
there 's half a dozen games left here .
i want you to watch every second of every minute of every one of them .
all right , so sit down .
oakland is having a miserable time .
berman .
you know how you go three and 11 , don 't you?
you go three and 11 when you make sunday 's picks on tuesday .
'cause it rained in cincinnati on saturday .
two starting quarterbacks never got to play .
that 's how you go three and 11 .
you 're a handicapper , not a psychic .
we still got monday and the parlay .
fuck monday and the parlay .
this isn 't about that .
this is about me .
it 's about the commission thing .
oh , no .
i don 't know .
oh , don 't bullshit me .
come on .
all right , listen .
i 'm gonna bump you .
10 % .
ok?
you earned it .
this is dangerous territory we 're getting into .
you understand?
but i 'll bump you .
now , talk to me about monday night , because everyone , i mean everyone , will double down after the hole you put 'em in .
it 's fine .
you 'd bet your mother 's house?
i don 't bet , walter .
if you did?
i like the pick , walter .
on your mother 's house or not?
with my mother in it .
another monday night thriller comes down to the final seconds .
carolina has to get at least into field goal range here .
high snap , pulled down nicely .
and a beautiful punt by feuderday .
he drills it .
thompson has to retreat .
and thompson dropped the ball .
the ball is on the turf , and the scramble is on .
it's heading toward the carolina goal line .
a couple of guysjump on it .
it might be changing hands right now .
fuck !
the call goes to cleveland .
carolina won't have a shot ...
fuck !
this one is over .
an unbelievable finish .
you don't switch to a three four halfway through the season .
no , what defense are they running in practice?
jones is on the field .
sunday .
we're still leaning heavy on the overs .
thank you , thank you , sir .
you are the man .
i'll talk to you ...
his improvement 's been great , but he got out of surgery two and half weeks ago .
i know he 's had a good week of practice , but his knee 's swollen .
help me out .
game time decision .
that 's what coach always says .
are we talking game time probable , huh?
or doubtful?
tell me .
you 're going into ...
it 's raining , it 's snowing .
can his knee hold up in that?
will the doc let him play?
yes , he is a gamer .
thank you .
i can read between the lines .
you got it .
unbelievable !
yee ha !
takes the snap , drops the throw .
whoa !
hell of a swing .
sport of kings , right?
no , no .
that 's horse racing .
what are you doing here?
southie told me where i could find you .
yep .
i wanted to get out .
clear my head .
so talk to me .
how 'd we do?
you haven 't seen the scores?
nope .
that 's how i wanted it .
make my picks , get the results later .
well ... highest sales volume ever .
yeah?
take a guess how we did .
i think we kicked ass .
it was amazing .
yeah , last week was nothing , walter .
you 're right .
it was nothing compared to what we lost today .
what 'd i go?
i got an idea .
why don 't i give you a glimpse of what happened , and then you take a stab on how you went?
just give me the numbers .
you don 't wanna play?
too bad .
would 've been fun .
grown men crying on the phone .
their wives screaming in the background .
three salespeople quit couldn 't take the pressure .
fuck .
no , no , no .
you lose ten out of 12 , " fuck " doesn 't quite cover it .
you know what would be more appropriate?
holy fucking shit !
or " jesus fucking christ !
i got the picture , walter .
you 're right .
you go two for 12 on our highest volume weekend ever , and ... what 's left to say?
except maybe we keep the phone number , only we switch it over to a fucking suicide hotline .
tomorrow morning , brandon , bright and early , we start all over again .
mr. novian wants to see you .
argh !
tell him ... to call me .
argh !
you tell him .
i didn 't recognize you without the suit .
this is my time off .
if you want to talk , make an appointment .
or should i call you brandon?
someone costs you 30 mill , you do research , right?
i mean , i got more than your name now .
i know where you live , where you 're from , where your family lives .
hey , your mother , there 's a sweet lady , man .
i just come from vegas .
dealt me three blackjacks in a row .
she 's a good woman .
where 's the cocky motherfucker who come to my house?
where 's john?
if you don 't like my picks , use somebody else .
come here .
it 's all right .
it 's all right .
i just come for an apology .
that 's it .
just look me in the eye and say you 're sorry .
i mean , say it so as to make me believe you mean it .
come on .
i 'm sorry .
fuck that .
i 'm not going to accept that .
come on , one more time .
i 'm sorry .
hey?
i 'm sorry .
you motherfucker .
you 're not even close .
you 're not even close .
no , it 's not gonna work .
it 's not gonna work .
i 'm gonna get my satisfaction .
i 'm gonna get something i want .
no no no no no no no no no no .
no no no .
what do you mean , " no no no "?
no , look .
i 'm sorry .
i 'm sorry !
brandon?
ok .
i 'm sorry .
come on , you 're not gonna tell me you 're scared of dying , are you?
mr. novian , it was a bad fucking weekend .

yeah , yeah .
yes , yes .
well let 's make it a fun day .
come here .
oh , yeah .
yeah .

walter .
i 'm busy .

i got some really strong stuff , man .
jerry , you got a good hole .
stay in it .
i went eight for 12 last week .
i 'm hot .
i 'm feeling it .
you had one good weekend .
what do you mean?
sykes system revolutionized this industry .

where 's my fucking ad?
i ...
take a hike .
what?
you 're fired .
i 'm not fired .
you 're out of here .
you need me .
get outta here , you cut rate parasite .
in six years , my worst weekend was never as bad as any of this guy 's last three weeks .
you 're not hearing me .
you don 't work for me anymore .
it 's over .
what the hell are you doing , walter?
oh !
am i doing something wrong?
am i not communicating?
is that it?
am i not projecting enough?
he doesn 't understand .
you all know what i just did .
i fired you !
come on , this is me !
all right?
i 've been here for you .
i 'm consistent and you know it .
the other guys , fuck 'em .
they come , they go .
i 'm the guy .
no , they don 't .
not him .
that 's true talent !
get it?
you can 't see it , i can 't explain it to you .
that 's why you 're fired .
think about what you 're doing .
you couldn 't pick your nose without a fucking computer .
you 're small .
you belong in a can .
you 've lost it !
you don 't touch him .
now , why don 't you have some self respect and leave?
you 're out of your fucking mind .
maybe i am .
maybe i am .
good luck !
asshole .
doesn 't realize i 'm trying to build an empire around you .
i hope you do .
ok , everyone .
let 's go .
back to work .
big playoff weekend coming .
chop chop .
hey , toni .
this is not a good time .
i know , but , brandon , i need to talk to you .
it 's important .
not right now .
brandon , you have to ...
you have to go .
no , i gotta ... get back on track .
it won 't matter .
you could win 100 games in a row and it won 't be enough .
it 'll never be enough .
he will ride you into the ground .
i 'll figure it out .
no .
brandon , please .
john anthony .
i'm wiped out , john .
amir .
my business , my house , my credit ... everything .
amir?
it 's gonna be ok , all right?
we 're gonna get back on track this weekend .
you hear me?
still you talk like this .
who the fuck are you?
like this is some kind of game .
you ruined me !
i was betting a few thousand a sunday when i called you , but you pushed me .
every call , all the time , with your talk .
i lost 380, 000 this weekend .
i was going to get married .
i had a life !
oh , no words now , huh?
no more money to squeeze so you shut up .
how do you fucking live with yourself?
come on .
that 's it !
coming , walter !
i know what the problem is .
he 's ok .
i 'll come back later .
no , no , stick around .
stay , stay .
these guys are finished .
you guys want anything before you go?
something to eat?
you leave the way you came in , fellas .
thank you .
shut the door .
who 's that?
we need a bat light or something .
one of them signals you shoot up into the clouds , so that no matter where you are ,
you just look up , you say , " hey , walter needs me .
because i must 've beeped you a hundred fucking times .
who were they , man?
the salvation army .
how does someone go one for eight?
a fucking monkey tossing darts could do better than that .
what 's with all the money , walter?
i got a plan .
we take your picks , we reverse everything .
like one of them twilight zone episodes where everything is opposite .
you say black , we go white .
how much is that?
peanuts .
275, 000 .
that 's how desperate i am .
what happened to the two mill?
two mill?
man , i was carrying twice that in red ink before you even showed up .
look around .
everything you see is smoke and mirrors .
i got three mortgages on this house .
what do you wanna know?
i 'm gambling again !
to cover my losses , i just got a loan from a guy who works out of a bar on 106th and broadway .
trouble with me is , i start betting you heavy after you went 100 % , and i rode you right into the fucking toilet .
i do know what the problem is , man .
we 're gonna take care of all this shit .
check this out , man .
i 'm brandon lang .
i 'm the kid who played sports and loved sports .
i 'm the kid who can pick winners .
i 'm the kid you called in vegas .
along the way , i lost something in here .
i don 't know what , but i know i gotta go back to being me , to being brandon .
if i get back to being brandon ...
you can pick again .
of course .
forget john anthony .
burn the suits .
mm hm .
my fault .
i fucked with you .
only two games .
two over unders .
that 's right .
if i get you to crunch the numbers , sprinkle a little brandon magic over it .
we get the salespeople burning up the phones ...
come monday we go four for four .
four for four .
that 's something .
how 's that sound?
this is important , you know?
i know it is .
pressure doesn 't help .
let 's go eat something .
let 's go to smith and wo 's .
brandon 's gotta stay and do some homework .
the brandon thing .
you see , i 'm forgetting .
two games .
two games .
two games .
two games .
two games .
two games .
hey , what ...
ho !
people living in the zone .
what does that mean?
his hair was all over .
brandon made these picks?
you 're looking at him .
new york in the under .
tennessee in the over .
sell 'em hard .
hello and welcome .
the conference championship game is underway .
can i watch , daddy?
come to daddy .
my angel .
i need you to root for me .
you see that team?
those are the bad guys .
we don 't want them .
that 's atlanta .
we want the good guys , the blue team .
that 's new york .
and new york has gotta win by more than five points , only you gotta root for a low score , ok?
because both teams together have to make less than 42 points , total .
all right , so it 's new york in under 42 points .
all right?
smith is wide .
cohn changing the play , audible lies .
at the line of scrimmage .
he doesn't like the defense .
robinson in motion to the left .
jones alone in the backfield .
cohn back to passer .
he's got the rookie .
anderson is in the middle ...
go , go , go !
in the end zone .
yeah !
touchdown , new york , and they take the early lead .

a champion goes down 86 times , he 's up on the 87th .
i 'm not gonna let you stay down .
no way .
because this is not about you .
or you .
or me .
it 's about your gift .
your gift transcends all this shit .
your gift is cosmic .
it 's metaphysic .
it 's eternal .
it is god !
besides , we have a contract .
bullshit .
bullshit?
bullshit , bullshit .

i hooked him up with every major client .
i built a fucking television show around him .
i took out full page ads .
i introduced him to the major clients of the world .
i did that .
i hooked you up with everybody .
think you 're gonna walk out the door , take that with you ,
leave me here holding the fucking sack?
bullshit !
i don 't know why i 'm talking to you .
what has this got to do with you?
this is between me and him .
what are you doing in this office?
what are you doing here?

ten .
push it all the way , southie .
and five , four , three , two ... live from the wdlx studios high above manhattan , here's your host , walter abrams .
hello , everybody , and welcome to the big weekend .
never before in the history of this industry has an offer been made
like the one i 'm about to present to you now .
i am so confident in john anthony 's picks for this sunday ,
i 'm so sure of the skills he 's brought to bear , and so anxious for you to get on the phone and dial the toll free number on your screen that for the first time in sports service history ,
i am going to guarantee our picks this weekend .
what 's that mean?
what does that mean?
it means this .
you tell us how much you 're betting with your bookie ,
you lose , we cover .
you heard me right .
that 's risk free .
now let 's go to the oracle ,
god 's gift , john anthony .
wow .
that 's all i can say .
the phones are gonna be flooded , walter , and they should be .
hey , john , why don 't you run down the pitfalls facing the average bettor?
i mean , when you think about it , a game this huge , all the added dynamics ...
i mean , uh , without your expertise ,
i guess the average bettor might as well just , what , flip a coin .
walter?
no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no .
hang on .
you can 't guarantee that they 're gonna win .
that 's insane .
come on .
i say if you can flip a coin to make a pick , i can guarantee the game .
what if we lose?
ah , fuck it .
i 'm ruined anyway .
look , man .
cover your ass , all right .
at least cap the thing out , right?
oh , brandon , can 't you feel it?
what?
can 't you just feel it?
i have no idea what you 're talking about .
oh , i think you do .
i think you do .
you know , the best part of the best drug in the world ain 't the high .
it 's the moment just before you take it .
the dice are dancing on the table .
between now and the time they stop , that 's the greatest high in the world .
made up your mind yet?
it 's the last minute !
i 'm here to make you money !
new york 's the one and a half point favorite , the over and under is 36 .
i want you to bet new york in the over .
come on , guy , it 's a fucking lock .
it 's new york in the over .
you can parlay it , tease it , do whatever you want , 'cause it 's guaranteed .
our reputation is the guarantee .
tammy !
i 'm coming .
28 years in the business , we 're not going anywhere .
can we please get some air in here?
you gotta make up your mind .
ok , that 's it .
kill the phones .
come on .
right now .
let 's go , let 's go .
they come from new york and kansas city in this match up .
the opening kickoff is coming up next .
we are under way in super forty .
it's a high end over ender .
down the middle .
jackson gets it , a short one for the 15 , tries to angle over to the right side , stripped away from ...
kansas city comes up with it .
ah , man .
harris getting to the outside , turns , clear path .
boy , does he have blocking .
touchdown , kansas city .
shit .
sets out for the pocket .
simpson .
he 's open .
guns one over the middle , simpson on the completion .
it's second and 15 .
setting up , he's got time again .
go , go .
looks down field and the slam intercepted .
what the fuck is that?
dawkins finds a wave of blockers .
over to the near side , he's going to go the distance .
touchdown , kansas city .
14 nothing , kansas city over new york .
new york's got it now for the third time in the game .
back to throw once again , pocket collapses and down it goes .
oh , man .
you better hold on to that coin you flipped , because this game keeps up like this , i 'm gonna have to borrow it .
well , it 's not over yet , walter .
i wouldn 't change my bet .
hm?
and second and long , second and about a dozen .
can they get something started?
what are they counting on today?
do they have to get away from the balanced attack we've seen all season?
will they lose the ground game now?
will they go over to the pass?
well , there is no way they'll be able to run when they're 14 points down .
handoff goes to the second man through .
it's jones , fullback , off the right side .
he's got room , downfield he goes .
will anybody catch him?
deep into the secondary now .
touchdown , new york .
extra point makes it 14 7 , kansas city .
kansas scores on the eight play drive , capped with rogers's 32 yard run .
and that's the end of the third quarter .
it's kansas city , 21 , new york , ten .
back to throw once again .
post available ...
let 's go ! ... beats the safety down the right side .
he's in !
all right !
it's kansas city , 21 , new york , 17 .
what a final four minutes we're going to have .
where 's brandon?
i don 't know .
where 's brandon?
we 're back in it , babe !
new york touchdown and we win both bets !
hey !
hey , brandon?
i believe this'll be their final possession .
can they do it?
can they get it done like they have all year long?
they're trailing by four .
don't forget , the new rule doesn't apply here .
they've gotta get into the end zone .
he left .
i know .
you didn 't tell me?
how about that?
no goodbye , no ... no nothing .
i 'm sure it 's all there in the letter .
i 'm sure it is .
i wonder what 's not in here .
what do you mean?
what do you mean , what do i mean?
he had enough .
he wanted his life back .
he said that to you?
well , loud and clear , by leaving .
i think it was something else .
yeah?
tell me .
you know .
no .
you have no idea?
you 're missing the game , walter .
oh , no .
this is the game .
on first down , the handoff is to jones .
he's on the right side .
he's got a blocker .
and a first down .
but he's dropped inbounds .
nice .
i guess brandon was homesick .
i don 't know .
or maybe he had such deep feelings for me that he couldn 't face saying goodbye .
wait a minute .
i just got an idea .
just came to me .
i mean , out of the blue .
what about this?
brandon didn 't tell me he was gonna leave because ...
you let him fuck you .
back to pass , rolls under the left side .
guns it over the middle , it's complete .
edwards has it , all the way down to the 44 , kansas city .
oh , god .
you deny it?
oh , my god .
do i have to , walter?
you know you did .
oh , you ...
another lock of the year?
i saw you , toni .
i saw you and him , that night .
i never went to vegas .
you mean you lied to me about the trip .
oh , don 't talk to me about lying .
i guess you had the whole thing set up .
oh , don 't make this about me .
just put me out there on a tray?
i put a tray out there .
you didn 't have to shove a fucking apple in your mouth and sit on it !
he's looking for his hot receiver .
edwards , again , got it !
kansas city , 23 .
admit it !
you played me , walter .
you 're fucking a i did .
it worked .
didn 't it?
with eight seconds left , new york has to spend their final time out .
brandon was right .
but you don 't deny it?
it 's the best pick he ever made .
i don 't know what that means .
deep drop sets up in the pocket .
fires over the middle .
batted down at the line !
so after everything , it all comes down to one final play .
you were gambling with me that night , walter .
with me !
brandon knew it , because he knew you .
he told me he was sure you were watching somehow .
so he asked me in to spend the night and put on a little show for you , walter .
but i didn 't believe him , walter .
oh , god , i didn 't believe him .
i mean , after all we 've been through .
so i figured , you know , " what the hell?
he slipped out the back , no big deal .
he never even stayed here .
and you .
you were in such a good mood the next day .
i figured , " thank god , because he must 've been wrong .
otherwise , why wouldn 't he confront us , confront me?
oh , walter .
so it all boils down to this .
can new york find the end zone?
this is what players dream of .
the chance to win it on the final snap .
you wanted to lose !
like i was something you could just toss on the table !
only we booked your bet , walter , brandon and me , who evidently love you more than you love yourself .
spreads the defense .
drops back to throw .
here comes the pressure .
he bounces to the right side .
your fantasy is to end up alone with nothing !
i won 't let that happen .
understand?
i will never let that happen to you .
this is it .
he's on the run , picks up a big block downfield .
this is real , walter .
you and me and julia , we 're all that 's real .
one man to beat .
this is it , walter .
he goes airborne from the five .
does he get in?
he 's in !
he 's in !
touchdown , new york !
apaches , win this game , a whoosh !
giants , with me !
over here with me !
this side , this side , this side , right in front of me , right here .
take a knee , take a knee , take a knee .
we got a tough team we 're playing today , y 'all know that .
toughest on our schedule .
now , most important thing we 're gonna do today is have fun .
i mean , have some serious fun .
we 're gonna play loose and enjoy ourselves .
we 're gonna play this wonderful game of football .
do we wanna win?
yeah !
what are we gonna do , play?
play !
huh?
play !
ah , let 's go do it !
what 's going on , chief?
coach , do you really think we can win today?
ho !
i 'd bet on it .
