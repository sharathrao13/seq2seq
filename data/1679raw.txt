something ...
there's a pain .
there's something you want badly .
it seems far away to you right now .
but you're determined .
and you'll do what you must to get it .
you can tell all that by my face?
all faces tell me the same .
everybody has a past .
they have pain and something they want .

her husband .

i was just giving your wife a hand with the drapes .
it didn't look like that .
that's all .
a lot that means .
grace , tell him .
i suppose he just wandered up here?
i should paddle your ass raw !

bobby cooper .
what brings you to superior?
car overheated .
ls darrell taking care of you?
he's dumb as a sack of hammers .
yes , he sure is a character .
where are you headed?
california .
do you live there?
a man wants me to sail his boat .
you're a sailor man?
that would be the life .
just get on a boat and sail away .
a man could disappear like that .
lf i'd known she was married ...
it wouldn't have made a difference .
you're a man without scruples .
i can smell it on you .
yeah , that's the sweat of a man that hasn't an honest bone in his body .
don't be offended .
a man without ethics is a free man .
i envy you .
a woman with her looks and a man my age , what was i to expect?
women ...
can't live with them , can't live without them .
can't live with them , can't shoot them .
i bet she had you hard as a rock , wiggling her ass in your face .
you wanted to pull her pants down and hog her out , and then i bust in .
you got a temper .
i bet you just wanted to snap her neck .
i bet you just wanted to kill her .
would you?
would you kill her?
why would i kill her?
i'm sick of her little games .
you could do it and drift away on that boat without being noticed .
i'd love to split the $50, 000 life insurance policy with her murderer .
i've done some things , but i'm not a murderer .
how do you know if you've never tried?
you're joking , right?
that's right .
it's nothing but a joke .
enjoy your stay , lad .
you got a soda?
habla slowly .
a cold soda .
something to eat .
no , no .
drink .
keep it in you and nobody gets hurt .
the same goes for you , punk .
give me the money .
that's it?
lady , i've got kids to put through school .
what have you got , pal?
beautiful .
you're getting tasty .
give me the pack .
it's just books .
i'm a reader .
toss it .
it's personal family things .
give me the bag .
no .
no?
this is no good .
come on .
no?
he doesn't want to give me the bag .
he doesn't have to .
come on !
not my wedding ring !
extra never hurt .
murderer !
seor , you're hurt .
i'll call the police .
no .
no police .
here .
no police . $100 , no police?
no police .
what happened to your face?
i had an accident .
another accident?
you've got to be more careful .
what the hell happened to my car?
i had to change your bottom hose too , but it runs like a dream now .
how much?
let's see ...
you got parts and labour .
let's just call it ... $150 .
how much?
150 .
to replace a radiator hose?
a hose in a 1964 mustang .
it's a ford , not a ferrari !
it's not just a ford .
it's a 1964 mustang .
what's that got to do with it?
i don't know .
but it's the reason i'm living here , and you're just passing through .
you owe me $150 .
i just got rolled .
get out your american express gold card and call the guy on tv ...
i don't have a credit card .
then you'll have to work this off .
i've got a movado .
it's worth $7, 800 .
you could sell it for that .
i can't see no numbers .
that's why it's expensive !
look at the gold .
no day , no dates .
far as i can tell , this ain't worth a duck's fart .
i got this for $3 . 75 .
it's got lots of doodads .
i'll stick with that .
you son of a bitch !
my lawyer will shut you down .
no credit cards , but a lawyer?
sweet talk me all you want to , but didn't you read this sign?
what sign?
i want my car .
i want my $150 .
what's the line on dallas?
you deadbeat lose my number !
mike , you ...
mike who?
cici , it's bobby .
i know it's been a while , but i'm in a jam .
you need money? $150 .

bobby , i expected to be seeing you , not talking to you over the phone .
what a day i've had .
this will sound like a highly improbable story .
i had the money .
i'm on my way to vegas , and my car breaks down .
i go into this store to get some food , and the place gets robbed .
and the robber gets your money?
there were two , and they got shot .
the old lady shot them .
she kills them , and the money in the bag gets shredded to pieces .
what are the odds?
so i thought maybe you could ...
can't you wire me $150?
i'd pay it back with the rest .
which you don't have .
i can sell my carin vegas .
where are you?
ln this little shithole 200 miles east of phoenix .
superior .
couldn't you send it ...
no !
listen to me , you punk !
i don't care if you got hit by a truck and run over by a steamroller .
you owe me $13, 000 and i want it on my desk tomorrow !
orl'll showyou whatbad luck is !
you understand?

and maybe i don't take the otherthree fiingers ...

what happened to your hand?
i cut myself shaving .
yes , i've got to be more careful .
any requests?
all country shit sounds the same .
how about i pick one out for you?
don't you just love patsy cline?
why doesn't she put out more records?
because she's dead .
that's sad .
don't that make you sad?
i've had time to get over it .
you ain't from around here , right?
where are you from?
oz .
no , you ain't from oz !
oz is from that movie .
you are too quick for me .
no !
i'm seeing , but i'm not believing .
what are you doing with my girl?
i asked you a question .
toby , we were just talking .
shut up .
get back to our table .
don't make me ask you again .
what are you doing with my girl?
i wasn't doing anything .
that's not how it looked to me .
you tried to make time with her .
ls everyone in this town on drugs?
i just asked him for a quarter .
shut your mouth .
we've got business to take care of .
and i ain't never taken no drugs .
maybe you should .
i wasn't trying to make time with your girl .
i'm calling you out .
you want to fight over her?
you don't know who i am .
the name's toby n. tucker .
people call me tnt .
you know why?
they're not very imaginative?
because i'm just like dynamite .
when i go off , somebody gets hurt !
fine .
i tried to make time with your girl .
now i'm terrified , and i've learned my lesson , and you can go away .
jesus christ .
stand up .
or i'll beat you where you sit?
finish your pop and leave him .
don't you never mind , flo .
this will be over real quick .
one touch toby .
come on , pussy .
you're real lucky this time .
but i'm going to see this through .
i think i'll make you walk home .
what was that all about?
toby thinks everyone wants jenny .
it's jenny who wants every man she sees .
i can't open off sale for you .
it's the desert .
it makes people go bonkers .
i'll help myself to some coffee .
you be careful now .
son of a bitch !
look what you've done .
i burned my gun hand .
it's all red .
i'll put butter on it later .
joe , get a mop and clean up .
shasta , don't scare that nice man .
sorry about that , sugar .
let's see . $3 . 25 .
have a nice day .
i'll sure try .
goddamn it !
why?
get me out of this fucking town .
mckenna realty
jake's the name , real estate's my game .
what can i do for you , lad?
what can i do for you , lad?
i hoped we could talk .
about what?
about your wife .
about your $50, 000 life insurance policy .
you'd split it with her murderer .
i think the heat's getting to you .
you brought it up .
i don't always mean what i say .
you meant it .
you're a slimy bastard who'd have his wife killed to get rich .
what does that make you?
the slimy bastard that'll do it .
you're a jealous man . lf you can't have grace to yourself ...
you're not the sharing kind .
i have what you call a love hate relationship with grace .
you love her , but you hate her .
no , i hate loving her .
i hate having to tolerate the little games she plays .
like fucking half this town behind my back and laughing at me .
bitch !
she wants me to hit her .
she likes it .
she likes to torture me .
but after all ...
she's my family .
she's my little girl .
my baby .
i couldn't stand to watch her as she sucks her last breath .
no .
not me .
but you ...
you've got a killing in you .
let's say i want the bitch dead .
what do you want?
how do you put a price on murder?
i put it at $50, 000 minus your cut , of course .
which is?
20, 000 .
i don't have that kind of money .
getting the insurance takes time .
how much can you get?
maybe 10, 000 .
i need 13, 000 .
that's a bit much .
we're not talking about buying a car , but about killing your wife .
it's 13, 000 or it's nothing .
you drive a hard bargain .
but i had a feeling you were my boy when i first met you .
it looks like we've got ourselves a contract .
do we shake hands?
lf you can't trust the man you've hired to kill your wife ...
it's got to look like an accident .
lf it don't , it's no good .
i'll be a penniless murder suspect while you're living it up somewhere .
how do you want it?
it can't be done at the house .
i want some money up front .
why don't i buy you a plane ticket while i'm at it?
i know you .
listen ...
you go to the house to see her .
tell heryou had to see her .
yousweet talk the woman .
a young buck like you mustbe good at that
then shift the conversation .
talk about the jeep .
she loves that
maybe the only thing she does love .
she'll take you fora ride out in the desert someplace quiet
riding through the red rocks and mesas .
she loves it out there .
so do l .
we've got that in common .
there won'tbe anyone around butyou andsome prairie dogs .
and then ... sweet talk her .
ltmakes no difference to me .
putherat ease , and then ... ... do it !
you could leave him .
it's not that easy .
walk away .
maybe you can take chances .
you can wander wherever you please .
i can't .
i don't want to be alone .
i wish i was a bird .
some of the old lndians thought you could change into animals .
i wish i could . lf i was a bird , i'd fly to florida .
disneyworld .
i've always wanted to go there .
then i'll fly to new york , maybe .
then i'd fly to st. louis and all over texas .
then i'll fly to california .
then i guess i would've seen it all .
then i could die .
they say you don't feel anything .
that the shock kills you before you hit the ground .
i've always imagined it's just like flying .
i bet , right now , you don't know if you want to kill me ...
... or fuck me .
stop !
i can't !
what's the matter?
nothing .
doesn't feel like nothing .
get out of town quick , bobby .
don't do this to me .
i've been fucked over by too many women .
you're the queen of hot and cold .
it's such a mess with jake .
i know all about being in a mess .
jake was with my mom .
after my real father died .
he used to call me his " little half breed " .
he kept my mom on the side .
he had a wife someplace else .
he'd control me .
you lookso pretty .
putyour arms around me .
why?
don't fuck around like your mama .
he was raping me the whole time .
for years .
my mom ...
it tore her up 'cause she couldn't do nothing about it .
she became an alcoholic .
they found my mama down here .
at the bottom of apache leap .
virgil , sheriff potter , said she was drunk and went insane .
i'd never believe she ran off that cliff by accident .
she was like me .
she just wanted to fly away .
i'm so sorry .
what are you going to?
life , right?
have you ever been to california?
yes .
ls it pretty?
it's another world .
it's beautiful beaches and blue water .
clear sky , as far as the eye can see .
take me with you .
i won't hang on you .
you can dump me there .
i just want to leave .
i can't leave before i get hold of the $150 for that crazy mechanic .
darrell?
he and jake ...
do you have money?
jake only gives me $20 at a time .
lf you could get money , i could get us out of here .
there's money .
a lot .
where?
jake hides it in a safe .
ln the bedroom floor .
my mom said there was more than $100, 000 there .
ln cash?
there's nothing else with jake .
he sits there , he laughs , he talks to himself and counts it . $100, 000 ... son of a bitch .
what do you mean?
we need the combination .
it takes a key .
he keeps it on him all the time .
so it's slapping up against me when we do it .
then how do we get it?
kill him .
i can't kill anybody .
it's not like he's a young man .
he had time to live .
it would be quick .
he doesn't even have to feel it .
do it at night .
come up behind him when he's asleep .
or when he's pounding me ...
bobby !
i see it .
it's in you .
i see death .
it's in your heart .
do it for me .
i'll do anything for you .
you need the money to get out of here .
it's three miles back to town .
it's a lot more than $100, 000 .
where are you going?
hey , you there !
they're cursed .
all the miners last century killed off all the lndians at the mine .
earth ran red with blood .
i've seen peculiar things on a hot day .
saw a scorpion sting itself to death .
a killer killing itself .
i've seen a coyote tear its own leg off before it bled to death .
a white man will get himself killed just rubbing shoulders with another .
kissy , kissy .
nice little pussy there , you see it coming .
that will be the death of him .
you sure see a lot for a blind man .
i'm blind , but i can still see .
we're all eyes in the same head .
everything is everything .
what?
everything is nothing too .
maybe one day i'll have time to sit on a corner and spout wise .
think you'll live that long , motherfucker?
everybody's got a mother .
you don't rip up the mother .
it's like popcorn .
the more you eat , the more you want .
i've got things to do .
you don't see me stopping you .
ain't you got anything for the sick?
sorry .
i'll catch you next time .
you tell your lies pretty good .
hi .
patsy cline .
i just wanted to thank you .
for what?
for defending my honour .
i wasn't defending your honour .
you were going to fight for me .
i was gonna pound your boyfriend .
he ain't my boyfriend .
i let him take me out , but i ain't spoken for .
not yet , that is .
i ain't going for you .
marry toby .
you won't do any better in this town .
that's what i thought till you came .
i saw your car at the gas station .
that's a cool car .
do you want to take me for a ride?
no , i don't .
i just want ...
you wouldn't have $150 ...
shit .
i told you it wasn't over .
you're at it again with my girl !
no , i'm not .
tell him .
you're too late .
we're riding off in his car .
what?
what's your name?
that tears it .
i'm going to bust you up for good .
i'll break you in a million pieces and break them into a million more !
you don't know me .
i'm psycho crazy !
yes , you're tnt and when you go off somebody gets hurt .
it don't matter if you beat him up , because we love each other .
i want to have his love child .
would you shut up !
you're going to pay for that .
come on .
toby !
sheriff potter ...
your poor mama hasn't seen you since this morning .
i was just home for lunch .
i want to see smoke coming out of your ass on your way home !
bye !
don't go nowhere without me .
i want to have your love child .
where are you going?
up to harlin's .
get in .
there was a young fellow up at jamilla's today when it got hit .
she says he got whacked by one of the robbers .
i wish i could help you .
i just want to get up to harlin's and get out of town quickly .
that's a nasty cut .
i fell on a rock .
it's not as bad as it looks .
everything all right?
yes .
where are you going?
just up at darrell's .
so how's the wife?
ls the little eskimo baby walking?
yes , just fine .
have you seen my wife?
i'm looking for her .
no , but if i see her , i'll tell her you're looking for her .
what have you got there?
some trash?
kind of peculiar how things happen .
a man's car breaks down .
there's a robbery , people get killed .
all that money ...
and now ...
now old jake is out looking for his young wife .
and then you show up .
time's running out , son .
i'll be seeing you in the morning .
hey there , bud .
i started to think you wasn't coming back .
feel like you're running in circles without getting anywhere?
you've been there?
you just have to tough it out .
you believe that?
lf you think bad , you get bad .
that's a decent philosophy .
no charge .

i'm a tourist .
are you a russian?
yes , and i'm a rich russian .
maybe we could work something out .

just because you ain't commies no more ,

get out and spread them !
i want my lawyer !
i love america .
great country !
get up !
toby n. tucker doesn't beat someone without giving him a chance .

it's what any offended man would do .
i'm stomping your ass !
what are you fighting for , anyway?

it ain't over , bitch !
you killed him !
hello?
grace , it's bobby .
aren't you in vegas?
what do you want?
i can't get you off my mind .
i think of nothing but you .
i want to get out of here , and i want to take you with me .
i thought you couldn't get your car .
i could if i had jake's money .
did the money change your mind?
no , i want to leave with you .
are you sure?
i came back for you .
i want you .
i stormed off because you spooked me talking about jake .
i've realised it all comes back to us getting out of here .
we have to get the money .
then i get the car , and we're the hell out .
but you couldn't kill anybody .
i would do it for you , grace .
so you can fly .
fly away like a bird .
grace ...
grace ...
grace?
after dark .
i'll leave the back door unlocked .
who was that?
wrong number .
you took a long time talking for the wrong number .
but then , you make friends so easily , don't you , grace?
you look like your mama , standing there in the afternoon light .
what are you looking at?
nothing , jake .
absolutely nothing .
that's it .
sun's going down .
regular people go home .
sit around a nice dinner table .
they trade stories about the day , the heat , maybe tell a little joke .
then they kiss ... ... sleep , wake up and do it all over again .
the day was all right .
we all got through it .
no , keep it .
the day ain't over yet .
night is part of day .
you see things in the shadows , and you hear things in the dark .
you afraid of the dark?
boy , i live in the dark .
and all because of a woman .
want some?
people fear what they can't see .
i see nothing , so it doesn't matter .
a kiss from a beautiful woman , a lick from a dog , the kiss of death .
it's all the same to me now .
we're all floating like sticks in a stream .
just enjoy the ride , huh?
that's about it .
not me .
i've got plans .
that makes the great spirit laugh .
we all got plans .
i planned on seeing all my life .
you never planned on coming here .
i don't plan on sticking around .
i was a smart ass too .
i got smart with the wrong man's daughter .
i got acid poured on my peepers for my trouble .
human beings ain't only human .
they got animals inside them too .
i hope she was worth it .
she was worth it .
worth every black minute since .
time's up , old one .
got any last minute words of wisdom?
things ain't always what they seem .
ask yourself : ls it worth it?
because one day earthmaker will come down , look right in your heart .
you better know what you're doing .
are you a human being orjust some hungry ghost?
you're crazy .
i'll be seeing you .
i won't be seeing you .
cheap bastard .
gave me back my own change .
come on , jesse .
we're going for a walk .
nice air outside , huh?
you coming to bed , or aren't you?
you fuck around like your mama , but you always come home to daddy .
because you know daddy's the best .
you've been a bad girl , right?
please forgive me , papa .
fuck it away .
but it won't go away .
because your mama won't leave you alone .
you broke her heart when you stole me .
you've been a bad girl , bitch .
baby , i'm sorry .
i didn't mean to hit you so hard .
it just got away .
forgive me .
what's the matter?
did you hear something?
it was the wind .
someone's inside .
come on , baby .
don't stop now .
where did you get that gun?
stay here .
don't go .
let's call virgil .
you're just like your mama , always scared of things .
well , well , as i live and breathe .
give me that pipe .
i didn't expect to see you again .
thought you'd be on your way by now .
that's my gun .
that fucking darrell !
that redneck gets paid no matter what !
you've been working me all along .
that's what they call irony .
it's not what you think .
it's a big house .
you never made it to the desert .
did you eat her here in my bed?
now you've tasted both of us .
okay , i fucked her !
but it's her you should worry about .
she wants you dead .
she wants your money .
what are you babbling about?
how do you think i got in?
did you hear glass break?
did you hear any door shatter?
did she linger long enough to leave the door open before coming to bed?
you'd say anything to get off .
you know grace .
you know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of superior .
what is she to you?
a woman who wants you dead .
let me kill her !
all i want is $200 so i can get the fuck out of here .
$200?
yes .
i swear to god i'll kill her !
get up .
i'd be doing the world a favour killing you .
you're pathetic .
go on .
go kill grace .
well , is he ..?
it looks like you got him .
he must have slipped past me .
it's that drifter from this morning .
put that down .
it's all over now .
put it down .
that's my grace .
not about to let someone get the best of you .
that's why i love you .
grace !
do something !
help me , grace ...
like you helped her?
why did you wait so long?
no gun !
the money .
get the key !
she was right .
look at all this .
there must be $150 200, 000 ...
oh , grace , you were right .
fuck me .
what about him?
let him watch .
i want him to know what he's missing .
we're closed .
open up .
what do you want?
what the hell?
i've got a waitress coming over .
what do you want?
i want my car .
you got the money?
$200 , and earlier you were broke .
just get my keys .
i don't want no dirty money .
get the keys .
there's a $50 overnight storage charge that we must talk about .
there's a scratched hood , and how much did you get for my gun?
let's just deduct this .
the keys .
don't know nothing about no gun .
40, 000 people die every day .
why aren't you one of them?
trunk .
topped her up for you .
no charge .
i'm getting out , you're staying .
but remember , your prints are all over that gun ,
so be careful whose rectum you point your finger at .
left foot red .
she did it .
she fucking did it !
bobby , what's the matter?
nothing .
i stubbed my toe .
it hurt like hell .
i put the cars in the garage so people will think we went away .
good thinking .
i know a back road we can take .
a funny thing .
the jeep wouldn't start .
i had to push it .
a funny thing ...
you are leavlng superlor we know you'll be back !
fuck you , superior !
i feel so relieved .
where should we go?
hawaii .
i've dreamed about going there and lying on the beach ,
letting the water lick up against my toes .
i'd kill to go there .
you already have .
i thought you'd left me .
what do you mean?
when the jeep wasn't there , i thought you'd left with the money .
i've never had much luck with women .
the shit i've taken ...
i thought you were just like them .
when you came out of that house ...
well , you're here .
we're starting in the shit , but it's new for me to be with someone .
with you .
i love you , bobby .
we're going to pull this off .
we're going to pull this off .
don't stop !
he doesn't know anything .
he's going to check the trunk .
pull the fuck over !
sorry about that little swerve .
ajackrabbit shot across the road .
you had to fuck him , didn't you?
no , baby .
he killed jake .
said he'd kill me if i didn't go with him .
he wants the money .
don't lie !
okay .
but he never made me come .
i was only doing it so we could be free .
it meant nothing .
you're fucking him too?
ls everybody fucking everybody in this town?
you get him to do your dirty work and take the money and dump me !
no , baby .
you've got it wrong .
this road don't go to globe , grace .
where were you going to meet me?
it's not like that , virgil .
i got the money right here .
right here .
i watched you fuck that pervert for years while you said you loved me .
what about our opening that fine sporting goods store in milwaukee?
just you and me , grace .
what happened?
you just talk .
i sit around getting older waiting for you to free me !
you never did !
he did !
this is some girl , huh?
of course , you've had a lot of practice .
just like your crazy mama .
shut up !
take your share and go !
i don't want the fucking money !
it's you , grace .
only you .
i want you to be my wife .
what do you say , grace?
you sound just like jake .
go back to your family .
they love you !
there's at least $200, 000 .
we split it three ways and all just walk .
shut up !
you know shit about what's going on .
virgil , stop .
get the fuck back , grace .
did you get the story about wanting to be a little bird flying away?
were you going to help her fly away?
grace , get back !
did she tell you the story about how jake forced her to marry him?
and how he killed her crazy mother?
i bet she didn't tell you one story .
and it's the best one of all .
right , baby?
old , crazy jake was really her papa .
she liked fucking her papa .
she killed him , and she'll kill you .
no , you !
grace , no !
bobby , get the fuck up !
aren't you going to ask me?
about what horrifying , sick shit is coming next?
don't you really want to know?
was jake my father?
what do you want me to say?
yes , i was fucking my daddy !
and i married him !
i just wanted to be a kid ... ... and he took that from me .
they treated me like ... meat .
a piece of meat .
fuck them !
fuck the whole town !
they deserved to die !
grab him further up .
bend your knees and swing him .
see you , virgil .
and god bless .
ls this bothering you?
my hand is bothering me .
we've got to burn this .
you think , now that jake's dead , and i've got all the money ,
that one day i'll just ... pop !
don't you think i would've done it by now if i wanted to?
what can i do to make you feel more relaxed?
you could give me my gun back .
let's just finish what we started .
what happens to people's spirits when they die?
nothing .
they're dead meat , that's it .
you don't believe in anything?
i believe in this moment .
you want to help me with him?
he must be 300 pounds .
you hit me !
you hit me , bobby .
motherfucker !
well?
well , nothing .
we dump jake , split the money , then you're on your own .
i want to stay with you , bobby .
so you can sell me out again?
i was baiting him , like when you told jake you'd kill me .
try mexico .
with all that bread you'd live like a queen .
i don't want to go to mexico .
i want to stay with you .
don't you think i care about you?
you're a lying , back stabbing , psycho bitch who'll kill me one day .
but it's nice to know you care .
it's good to split here .
it'll take them months to find the body .
we've got to get out of arizona .
remember .
no body , no crime .
we'll dump the car in phoenix .
you'll find someone else .
there's always hope with $100, 000 .
hope's a four letter word .
hold him .
you make a pretty couple .
you should've been more careful , jake .
see you around .
grace , help !
i'm sorry i hit you .
bobby !
thanks .
can you make it back up?
i broke my leg !
ln the trunk there's a towrope .
tie it up .
i think it'll make it down here .
the trunk is locked .
you have to throw the key up .
i can't throw anything .
i can't move .
you have to come down .
you can make it .
please , help me .
i'm coming down .
just wait .
i knew you couldn't go after all we've been through .
where are you?
i'm coming down .
we'll go to mexico .
we were meant to be together .
bobby , i can't do this alone .
pull yourself together .
i'm not going to leave you .
i never wanted it to go down like this .
it was different with you , bobby .
you had dreams , like me .
we could still make this work .
i didn't want to hurt you .
right here .
you know why else i can never leave you?
because i love you , grace .
i love you , bobby .
i don't know whether to love you or kill you !
i love you , grace , but i can't trust you .
you're such a good girl .
jake can't help you .
you're still lucky .
arizona ...
