the meeting never even got started .
the feds moved in . . . . . . and bingo , the bosses , they moved out .
along comes a farmer .
anyway , carlo gambino came out of it . . . . . . capo di tutti capi , " boss of all bosses " . . .
bosses are going to jail .
people are getting whacked without permission .

i'll be back .
. . . to grow . . .
. . . and to find myself as a person .
you know?
not just as a woman . . . . . . but as an independent entity .
. . . but he could not handle that .
he said that i was driving him away .
he said i was driving him away .
caroline , things end .

he took a restraining order against you .
but what should i do?
you are a tragedy queen !

you cannot listen to my sessions !
it's so cool .
was that really paul vitti?

i love you .
i 'm so glad to be with you .
do you really?
and do you really love me?
of course .
what's the matter?
i 'm nervous .
why?
. . . and we 're getting married .
so what are you worried about?
what if you get tired of me?
. . . and completely lose interest in each other .
that won't happen to us .
is everything okay , paul?
would you stop talking?
i 'm sorry .
lie down .
thinking about your wife?
i wasn't thinking about my wife .
what are you talking about?
now i am thinking about my wife .
sorry .
dr. sobel .
mom?
it's me .
what do you expect?
i don't like it when someone breaks in . . .
i have a family .
i have a life .
and i have a serious practice .
that got away from me at the end there .
i couldn't get it up last night .
do you mean sexually?
no , for the big michigan state game .
of course , sexually !
what's the matter with you?
can i get this straight?
. . . because you couldn't get an erection?
don't that prove i 'm motivated?
you can take a pill for that .
that's a cheat .
i think mark twain said that .
are you gonna help me or not?
i don't believe this .
all right .
has this happened before?
the dead dick thing?
never .
well , one time .
last night .
one more time .
so twice .
do the math .
two times .
eight times .
eight times is not catastrophic .
maybe not to you .
look at you .
in my world , i deal with animals .
they may seem dumb to an educated guy like you . . .
i got less than two weeks . . . . . . to get strong , or they'll kill me .
what happens then?
i can't tell you .
you don't want to know .
you can't tell me and i don't want to know .
that's a big help .
the other day i was watching a tv commercial . . . . . . some kid playing with puppies .
i cried for 45 minutes .
slap a pair of tits on me , i 'm a woman .
i can't help you .
you 're turning me down?
i 'm leaving now .
you see this?
this is what i 'm talking about .
i 'm a dead man .
this fucking rat bastard . . . . . . won't help me .
all right , here .
sit down .
sit down .
what happened with your wife last night?
are you having marriage problems?
why do you have a girlfriend?
you 're moralizing with me now?
why can't you?
have you been under stress lately?
i got a lot of stress .
. . .
i'd say that was probably it .
just stress?
" just stress "?
stress is a very powerful force .
i doubt there's anything physically wrong with you .
that's it?
that's it .
that's it?
i think so .
you 're very good , you .
you are very good .
there's more to it  you 're very good .
there are underlying  understand me?
you 're right on the money .
that settles it .
you are my shrink .
no , i couldn't .
you 're not ready to open up .
you 're not a good candidate
listen to you .
the fucking honesty .
that's it .
you don't understand .
nobody , nobody talks to me like that .
you understand?
yes , i do .
that's it .
let's do it .
i 'm ready .
i 'm here for two more days .
for two weeks .
i just don't know what to tell my patients .
you want me to clear your schedule?
it would be my honour to do that .
my pleasure .
not jimmy .
i will do this myself .
you sure?
positive .
i will see you in new york .
okay .
want one of them?
no , thanks .
sure?
that's very kind of you , but i. . . .
want to give a little sta minch?
you sure?
the pause that refreshes .
i don't no , i really . . . .
you 're on vacation .
i 'm also about to get married . . . . . . so i'd like to go back to my hotel and . . . .

i'll tell you the truth .
i had a patient emergency .
you have patients in florida?
my god .

paul vitti .
mafia paul vitti?
oh , my god .
it's not like he's a regular patient .
he's got problems .
so you 're not treating him?
tell me you 're not .
i 'm not treating him .
you 're sure?
absolutely .
i was so worried .
i thought maybe you got scared or . . . . . . saw an ex girlfriend or something .
well , i don't know .
i love you .
i love you .
i 'm sorry , but everything's going to be okay .
give her a big hand !
let's hear it !
how about that?
that was great !
come on , get into it .
they eat fish .
this is not a big stretch for a whale .
stop it .
we 're having fun , right?
there she goes !
i 'm going to get a hot dog .
anybody want anything?
i'll go with you .
it's fine .
i'll be right back .
you think those whales piss in that water?
dummy .
is this a joke?
you 're employed by mr vitti . . .
. . . just like the rest of us .
i 'm sorry .
he and i discussed
that's it .
doctor , listen to me .
it is what it is .
no .
i am not going .
. . .
i won't treat him at all .
do you understand that?
capisci?
it's over !
end of story .
look at the size of this one .
jesus christ !
it's feeding time .
they threw me in the shark tank , paul .
they wanted to make a point .
that you 're scary?
believe me , i get it .
you 're in a mood .
what's he doing?
i don't know .
just get him .
you told me to take care of him , i will .
let's get out of here .
we 're being watched .
how do you know that?
i 'm a criminal .
it's my job .
who's the new face?
maybe he's vitti's new consigliere .
tell me about your father .
my father .
well , my father . . . .
let's sit here .
my father .
very well respected , god rest his soul .
he passed away?
i was about 1 2 at the time .
how did he die?
it was a sudden thing .
a heart attack .
how was the relationship?
were you close?
we were pretty close .
why is that?
what is that?
he didn't approve .
he slapped me around a couple of times .
and what?
and then he died .
how'd that make you feel?
think about it .
maybe all those things .
any feelings of guilt?
about what?
i didn't kill him .
i know that .
i 'm just speculating . . .
why would i want him to die?
. . . because you rebelled against his authority .
maybe some unresolved oedipal conflict .
english , english .
fucking greeks .
the young boy wants to replace his father . . .
it's a primal fantasy .
have you ever seen my mother?
are you out of your mind?
it's freud !
so what do i call you?
do i call you scott?
my friends call me captain .
captain?
i'd like a morphine and soda .
i 'm shaking .
seor sobel .

we can't accept this .
yes , you can .
thank you .
and then you'll leave us alone .
i'll leave you alone .

and did you see the guys coming?
one of them .
dressed like a busboy .
your father saw him too?
i knew the guy looked wrong .
why , paul?
so he walked to the table .
i watched him the whole way .
did you say anything?
and you were mad at him .
and then what happened?
and you blame yourself .
i could've saved him .
but you were mad at him .
i should've said something .
you couldn't have saved him , paul .
i killed him .
you didn't kill him .
i just let him die .
i let him die !
so why don't you say it now?
if he was here , what would you say?
i can't .
yes , you can .
i can't .
no , i can't .
tell him , paul .
i want to say i 'm . . . .
dad , i 'm sorry .
i 'm sorry .
i 'm sorry , dad .
i 'm sorry .
i let him die .
i 'm sorry , dad .
jesus .
poor guy's falling apart .
why don't he just pop him?
it's embarrassing , standing here like this .
shut up .
you couldn't save him .
i know i could've .
i could've .
no , he was trying to save you .
that's what you fought about .
no , i don't !
your father's not dead , paul .
he's trying to tell you

you can give me back the gun now .
. . . but i was real conflicted about it .

but you 're close to something .
the rest is up to you .

i want to please him when we 're in bed . . .
what kind of things does he want you to say?
well , he wants me to call him . . . . . . " big boy " . . . . . . and he's my " bucking bronco " . . . . . . and i 'm supposed to " ride him hard " . . . . . . and " put him back in the barn wet .
are you okay , dr. sobel?
well , it's . . . .
here's what i think you should do , elaine .
i would do whatever he says .
if he wants you to talk , talk .
i'd get down and bark like a dog .
i'd do whatever it takes .
smoke some joints , drink wine , whatever it is . . . . . . to get off on each other and be happy .
