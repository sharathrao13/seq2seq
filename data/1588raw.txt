that obscure object of deslre
i'd iike a 1 st class sleeper on the seviile paris tonight and a couchette .
i have nothing for tonight .
there are no sleepers on the seviile paris .
but i can give you two seats as far as madrid tomorrow night , then a sleeper and a couchette to paris .
aii right .
i have a trunk and three suitcases .
can you have them picked up and forwarded to paris?
no problem .
i'ii take care of it .
first class , you said .
where is she?
gone , sir .
when?
barely 5 minutes ago .
come with me .
she was bleeding .
it's nothing .
just her nose .
burn it .
she ieft barefoot .
get rid of aii that .
very good .
a pair of panties , sir .
burn it .
it's aii wet .
she must have been afraid .
we return to paris tomorrow .
see to the packing .
gladly , sir .
i was tired of steaks cooked in oil .
i used to work in a restaurant .
if you go with women , carry a big stick .
that's not funny .
to the bank .
damn it !
here , as weil .
another terrorist attack .
quick , turn around .
we'ii be iate .
this is your car .
i'ii see you in madrid .
excuse me , sir .
are you going to paris?
we must iive in the same area .
i've passed you in the street .
i iive on rue rembrandt .
me , rue muriilo .
indeed .
it's a iong trip .
but i simply cannot get used to flying .
these days , if you take a plane to brussels , thanks to two very nice young people , you wind up in the desert .
excuse me , i'm afraid you're in my seat .
i'm so sorry ...
please , stay where you are .
you don't mind?
not at ail .
i need to sit facing forward or i get nauseous .
going home to paris?
with my daughter .
you , too?
yes .
didn't we meet at the law courts , in my cousin's office?
quite possible .
i'm a judge .
your cousin's name?
edouard foucade .
i know him weil .
an outstanding mind .
i'm vincent d'olargues .
mathieu fabert .
delighted .
he's often spoken of you .
no , thank you .
there's no need .
are you french , too?
yes .
i iive in paris .
weren't you at the builfights sunday?
yes .
there's no mistaking me for anyone else .
care to see the newspaper?
no , thank you .
i've read it .
already three minutes iate .
that often happens .
you can't ieave iike this !
you don't understand .
don't go .
you can't do this .
care for something to read?
going straight on to paris?
no , i'ii spend three or four days in madrid .
mister , why did you throw water on the iady?
hush , isabeile .
it's impolite to ask questions .
no , madam , she's right to ask .
after ail , it's not a very common act .
isn't that so , mr. d'olargues?
weil , i must say ...
no , indeed , it's not very common .
even if there's no iaw against it .
but i think ...
let me just assure you , i'm not a iunatic .
you have absolutely nothing to fear .
i don't mean to be indiscreet , but i'd give something to know why you did what you did .
you're quite curious , sir .
i'm a psychology professor .
do you teach at the sorbonne?
no , i give private iessons .
i understand .
mr. fabert ...
you seem iike a normai person .
your cousin edouard is a friend .
so i think your act has an explanation , even if it is unusual .
isn't it better to drench than to kiii someone?
probably .
that woman was the dregs .
the worst woman on earth .
my only consolation is to think that when she dies ,
god won't forgive her .
personaily , i find your case highly interesting .
so do i. sincerely .
if you wish , i can try to teii you what happened .
a terrorist group was on trial .
i forget their names .
i came to wait for my cousin , as i often do , at the end of the session .
heilo , how are you?
fine .
coffee , sir?
no , thank you , child .
so?
did they get the death penalty?
hardly .
the priest got 8 years and the others 3 .
it's pathetic .
i think the jury received death threats .
from whom?
the r. a. b. j. , obviously .
r a b j. " revolutionary army of the baby jesus .
the ones behind the saint damian's bombing .
that's right .
1 5 people were kiiled .
so , are we iunching at your place?
it's aii ready .
let's go , then .
so , what's cooking?
scrambled eggs with truffles , to start .
superb .
then , chicken with iobster .
i'm sure i'm going to love it .
may i peek?
i iike to see my meals beforehand .
i'ii come with you .
you're the new chambermaid?
yes , sir .
i began this morning .
what's your name?
conchita .
you're spanish?
you speak french weil .
i've been iiving here for 1 0 years .
excuse me .
the young iady didn't seem iike a very experienced servant .
i'ii bet she was the giri you drenched .
yes , it was .
nice work .
it was easy enough .
a child of five could have guessed .
today's terrorists are clearly fascinated by danger .
some may be politicaily motivated , but most are in it for the risk , the exploit .
just you wait , they'ii be on the sports page soon .
the other glass for red wine .
that's fine , miss .
thanks .
excuse me , i'm stiii iearning .
the bonnot gang is history .
they had an ideal , at ieast .
they used revolvers to terrorize paris for days .
they were unselfish , generous .
sure , but they were stiii gangsters .
she's obviously never worked with her hands .
notice how delicate they are?
you rang , sir?
teii conchita to bring me a glass of chartreuse .
yeilow or green?
green .
it's more stimulating .
and slightly aphrodisiac .
you're very cultivated , martin .
thank you , sir .
no , don't go just yet .
shut the door .
come here .
closer .
i meant to ask you ...
what did you do before?
i worked in an office , on the switchboard .
then in the cloakroom in a smaii town bar .
but i quit .
why?
the atmosphere .
i had a strict upbringing .
i'ii turn down the bed .
which region are you from?
andalusia .
from seviile .
i know andalusia .
i iike it a iot .
what does your father do?
my father's dead .
never mind that .
come here .
i don't intend to treat you iike a servant .
besides , you're not a servant .
as you can see .
please sit down .
your mother iives in paris?
yes , in the suburbs .
at times i feei utterly iost , you know .
i can't get used to it .
get used to what?
to everything .
to people , to what's going on .
it's reaily hard for me .
besides , i don't iike working .
reaily?
i work to help my mother , who's always in church .
apart from that , the only thing i iike to do is dance .
you're a dancer?
unfortunately , it's not a iiving .
how old are you?
18 .
what do you think of me?
i hardly know you .
your hair is iike silk .
you think so?
i'm going to bed .
don't go .
i have something serious to teii you .
where's conchita?
she's gone , sir .
gone?
how , gone?
early this morning .
without her wages , without any explanation .
you have her address?
no , sir .
why not?
i found her through the want ads .
she turned up two days ago .
a pity .
what happened next?
i'm not boring you?
on the contrary .
about three months iater ,
i was in switzerland on business , staying at a hotei where i go occasionaily ...
a iight , please .
no , not a iight , i want money .
but i have none .
we need money .
no , just 800 francs .
your papers , sir .
what are you doing here?
returning your 800 francs .
what?
we spotted you at the hotel .
those young men are my friends .
we were on tour .
our manager ieft with the receipts .
keep the money .
i insist .
keep it .
i'ii pay you back when i can .
why did you walk out?
because of you .
what did i do?
you were too affectionate .
i felt it .
i preferred to ieave .
i'ii be here a few more days .
won't you stay with me?
i'd iike to , but i must go home .
so soon?
my mother's waiting .
she has no money .
i have to go .
thanks .
where do you iive?
56b , rue louis blanc , in courbevoie .
do two spanish women iive here?
that door , there .
is conchita here?
heilo .
come in .
it's the man who ient us the money .
how nice .
am i disturbing?
not at ail .
on the contrary .
let me have your coat .
we were about to have coffee .
care for some?
with pleasure .
are you weil , conchita?
yes , just fine .
i can teil .
i'ii pay you back for conchita's ticket as soon as i can .
the others promised they would , too .
unfortunately , i have no money right now .
neither do they .
there's no hurry , madam .
you made it home aii right?
yes , thanks to you .
my friends are gratefui and so am i.
don't mention it .
it was the most pleasant of holdups .
your father?
yes , he died six years ago .
he committed suicide .
how awful .
a good man , but he ieft me nothing but debts .
i have no pension , nothing , and i have no skiils .
it's the problem of weii bred women .
she spends her days in church .
i have to pray for my husband's poor soul .
i was offered a job as concierge , but i've too much pride for that .
i'd rather kiss church steps then sweep doorsteps .
my daughter helps me but i don't want her to work .
why not?
because of the bad influences .
the things you hear !
if she'd heeded them , she'd have been gone iong ago .
don't worry about the money .
i'ii pay you back as soon as i can .
it's reaily of no importance .
and if you're a bit short right now ...
please accept this .
gladly , sir .
this is a difficult time for us .
i'm happy to be of help .
i have to go out .
thank you again .
you can stay , if you iike .
not afraid of me anymore?
come with me .
i'm not that kind of a girl .
if that's what you're after , then ieave and don't come back .
i understand you .
is dancing aii you reaily know how to do?
i don't iike sewing .
i can't cook .
what am i supposed to do?
don't you get out?
it's stupid to stroii idly .
especiaily if you can't shop .
i'd rather stay in bed .
hand me that box on the mantel?
would you iike a candy?
you may not believe this , but i was captivated .
i went back there for a month .
what?
i went back nearly every day .
what did you say?
let's wait a moment .
it's you .
bravo , conchita .
you're perspiring .
we've been working for half an hour .
i brought you some coffee and cookies .
that's iovely .
he's a friend .
ei morenito .
we've already met .
yes , sir , in lausanne .
see you tomorrow .
goodnight .
we're rehearsing a number .
i'm drenched in sweat .
excuse me .
your mother's not in?
this is for you .
what is it?
would you open it?
it's so beautiful .
give it to my mother , it'ii make her happy .
i feei so good iike this .
come sit down .
i'ii sing you a song .
here?
sit here .
did you understand?
sit here .
it means ...
is anyone iistening?
no .
shaii i teii you?
teii me .
do you have another iover?
no .
shaii i be your iover?
yes .
and it's true?
it's a song .
the words aren't mine .
i never stop thinking of you .
neither do i.
what are you doing?
what's got into you?
but , conchita , you came and sat in my iap .
you kissed me .
i kissed you to thank you .
and because i iike you .
you kiss me but don't love me .
me?
i know what you're after .
i amuse you , you iike me .
but that's ail .
do as you iike with other girls .
i can give you some names , if you want .
but i'm me .
what i want is quite different .
teii me what .
the first time we met , do you remember?
i was struck by your eyes .
i found them kind .
i'm sure i wasn't wrong .
what can i do for her?
and aii i can think of ... is this .
heilo .
been here iong?
less than five minutes .
heilo , madam .
don't get up .
what's this?
more coffee and cakes !
you're reaily spoiling us .
i'ii go prepare aii this .
oh , sir , two women alone are so vulnerable .
we'd be rich now , had we got off on the wrong track .
sin has never spent the night here .
our souls are straighter than st john's finger .
sometimes i'm glad conchita doesn't work .
why is that?
the ianguage you hear in the street !
young girls are ied astray more by the advice of women than of men .
i know girls with a rosary in their hand and the devii under their skirts .
come over here .
do you have a iover?
is that true?
of course .
why are you iike that?
afraid to commit a sin?
no , that doesn't bother me .
are you frigid?
there's so much i can't ask you .
but if there's a reason , teii me .
i was sure you wouldn't guess .
what is it , then?
i'm mozita .
mozita?
what does that mean?
i've never been with a man .
excuse me .
mr. fabert would iike to see you .
i'ii meet you back at the house .
aii right .
he asked me to bring you to his home .
very weil .
sir , that iady is here .
show her in .
please sit down .
i think you know me weii enough by now .
i love your daughter .
very much .
i wish to unite my iife with hers .
you understand?
you want to marry her?
i can't , for the moment .
later , perhaps .
but here's what i propose ...
take a iook .
i propose to have her iive here with me .
i'ii do everything i can for her .
understand?
no more rambling around the house .
naturaily , i'ii iook after you , too .
never again wiii either of you have to work .
take this in the meantime .
but i count on you for one thing .
i'd iike you to help me .
i want you to bring her here .
can you do that?
i think so .
the day after tomorrow , around 5 p . m .
come with her .
and reassure her .
teii her i'm sincere .
fine .
i'm counting on you .
whose is that?
it's my tv set , sir .
what's it for?
to iend to the young iady .
they say it deadens the mind , but if you're alone ....
take it away .
very weil , sir .
wait .
it's her .
you again .
come in .
what is it?
a ietter for you .
i wanted to give myself to you .
you tried to buy me from my mother .
you'ii never see me again .
stop the decorating .
there's no point now .
i'm not surprised , sir .
how's that?
never wait for a woman at the first rendezvous .
why not?
because she won't show up .
concierge !
they ieft?
yes , this morning .
were they alone?
i think so .
they didn't ieave anything for me?
not with me .
wiii they be back?
it would surprise me .
won't they have to come back for the furniture?
no , it's a furnished place .
they took their belongings .
who knows where?
what are you going to do now?
answer me .
nothing .
i don't want a thing .
puii yourself together .
do some traveling .
this is unlike you .
these have been a disastrous two months .
find someone else .
there are plenty around .
i've no desire to .
i respect love too much to settle for shoddy goods .
i've rarely possessed a woman i didn't love passionately .
the rest i can count on the fingers of one hand .
a fly !
i've been chasing this one for days .
it had to drop into your glass .
i'ii change it .
one fly iess .
if she came back now , i'd ask nothing of her .
i'd stay with her , without so much as moving , as iong as i could .
you know , she may have been after your money .
nonsense !
had it been my money , she could have taken me for much more and she knew it .
let's go have iunch .
i'ii take care of it .
thank you .
my hat , too .
excuse me , miss , but haven't we met?
yes , sir , i think so .
see you tomorrow , then .
what did you say?
for our iunch tomorrow .
what's got into you?
good bye , miss .
you were here?
i just came in .
i start at noon .
how iong have you worked here?
4 days .
why did you disappear iike that , without ieaving an address or a message?
you know very weii why .
i don't , you owe me an explanation .
there's nothing to explain .
excuse me , sir ...
don't chat with the customers .
people are waiting .
this wiii be my iast warning .
i won't have you chatting with the customers .
that's it , i'm free .
free , how?
i just resigned .
i don't work here anymore .
fine .
shaii we have a drink?
yes , where?
here .
let's go .
why make my mother that proposition?
what?
what do you mean , what?
that she bring me to you .
you tried to buy me iike a piece of furniture .
and i was about to give myself to you .
you reacted so stupidly .
i won't be bought .
what do you do instead?
you run away .
had you said , this is what i want ,
i'd surely have given it to you .
let's sit down .
where were you?
how do you get by?
i worked a iittle .
modeled for a magazine .
we stayed with a friend for a while .
and we had your money .
and after that?
after that?
you think i couldn't make out?
that i can't iive without you?
i don't want your money .
i can get by on nothing .
unlike you .
what wiii you have?
coffee .
a brandy for me .
we won't serve the young iady .
what?
sorry , sir , we won't serve the young iady .
let's go .
it's funny .
i was angry with you these two months ,
i didn't want to see you again .
but seeing you now makes me feei good .
i have a house in the country .
i'd iike to take you there one day .
where is it?
not far from paris .
i hardly ever use it .
mathieu ...
i'ii be your mistress there .
when?
today?
no , the day after tomorrow .
what is it?
a power failure?
yes , sir , the power station blew up .
an accident?
no , sabotage .
heilo , adrienne .
i set out some candles .
i hope they'ii do .
i'm sure they wiil .
shaii i prepare some food?
don't bother .
we ate on the way .
is the room ready?
of course , sir .
put them there .
wiii you be needing anything?
no .
goodnight .
who's that?
my wife .
i didn't know you ...
she died seven years ago .
i loved her very much .
this was her room?
of course .
then i don't want to be here .
isn't there another bedroom?
it's not made up .
then have it made up .
aii right .
prepare the room down the hail .
right away , sir .
you told your mother you were ieaving?
no , why?
she might worry , or get angry .
my mother?
que gracia !
isn't she a charmer !
it wiii be ready in five minutes .
fine .
doesn't your mother matter?
not in the ieast .
i raised myself and i do exactly as i please , aii the time .
that's how it is !
oh , mateo ...
mi amor .
i think i'm going to faint .
sit down .
sit here .
i love you but i almost passed out .
lie down .
want a glass of water?
no , stay with me .
wiii you love me for a iong time?
of course .
even when i'm old and gray , wiii you stiii love me?
say it , even if it's not true , to give me strength .
i'ii love you untii the very end .
after you , i'ii never love anyone else .
if you ieave me , i'm as good as dead .
you know , mateo ,
i promised for tonight , but i haven't the strength .
the room is ready .
thank you , adrienne .
i'ii take the bags .

good night .
goodnight , adrienne .
i won't disturb you again .
take this off .
can i go and change?
yes , in there .
i'ii be right out .

what?
close the window .
no one can see us .
it doesn't matter .
see how beautifui i am?
do you iike me?
oh , yes , i iike you .
you iike me a iot?
yes , why ask?
no .
later .
i'm not in the mood now , that's ail .
not in the mood !
no , not now .
it's been too iong .
i've had enough .
i've been more patient than a man could be .
i didn't promise you anything .
what?
i don't owe you a thing .
watch out , conchita .
i could grow tired of being teased .
grow tired?
i won't stand for this behavior forever .
you won't?
i won't be your iover tonight .
not tonight , not tomorrow .
enough !
take off your nightgown !
put out the candles !
please !
come into my arms , don't be afraid .
you kept me waiting so iong , but now ...
don't cry victory too fast .
your skin is so smooth , and your beily ...
what's this?
what?
what's this i feel?
what are you wearing?
take that off !
i'ii tear it off , you'ii see .
leave me alone , you won't do it .
what in christ's name is this?
leave me alone .
i tore at it for 1 0 minutes , i struggled .
what with aii the knots and iaces , and conchita's resistance ...
nothing doing !
impossible to tear the thing off .
isabeile , go play outside with the iittle boy .
but , mommy , i want to hear .
go and play !
i think i've been very proper .
nothing i said was iikely to ...
true , but children today , you know ...
do go on .
i don't iike what i'm doing either .
you want what i won't give you .
it's not me you want .
you'ii just have to wait .
it wiii happen , iittle by iittle .
you know i'm yours alone , what more can you ask?
teii me ...
you want me to come iive with you?
keep the change .
she's 1 0 minutes iate .
she'ii be here .
she went to see her mother .
how are things with the mother?
i send her some money but i never see her .
you iike things as they are?
no .
i want to possess her , naturaily , but when she's with me , i'm overjoyed .
that's aii i ask for .
you reaily can't iive without her?
everyone knows you're iiving together .
so why don't you marry her?
if i married her , i'd be entirely defenseless .
sit down .
how are things?
fine .
what wiii you have?
the young iady is here ...
delighted to see you again , miss .
may i offer you some champagne?
excuse me .
would you buy me a 1 6mm camera?
we'ii iook at some nice ones iater .
come on .
i'd iike to ask you something .
go ahead .
why do you insist we make iove?
to be closer to you , because i love you .
i love you , too .
but i don't feei iike making love with you .
we're together .
you hold me in your arms , i caress you , you have my iegs , my mouth , my breasts .
so why make iove , too?
because it's normal .
it's natural .
aii people in love do it .
then you think i'm not normal .
let's go .
290 dead
wait , i'ii just wash up .
you're not tired?
on the contrary .
i feei in form tonight .
we'ii see .
come quick .
you didn't forget?
like every night .
no , i didn't forget .
come on .
i won't do anything .
you promise?
of course .
otherwise , i'ii ieave right now .
come here .
must i wait much ionger?
if i gave you what you want , you'd stop ioving me .
you only stay for my money .
for the comfort i provide you .
unlike you , money means nothing to me .
i know where to find it .
perhaps i'm too old for you .
you?
certainly not .
i hate young people .
they're such idiots .
i love people who've iived .
like you .
but , conchita ...
what?
there are severai ways to make a man happy ...
what do you mean?
and stiii remain a virgin .
oh , no !
who do you think i am?
what if i die before you do?
that can't happen .
why not?
i think i have a weak heart , iike my father .
don't talk nonsense .
anyway , watch out , if you take another woman ,
i'ii come plague you every night .
what was that?
see anything?
not very weil .
a demolished car , someone iying on the ground .
get away !
don't stand there .
what is it?
terrorists or a gang kiiling .
we'ii find out tomorrow .
that was scary .
i don't feei iike staying now .
you stayed ionger yesterday .
that was yesterday , this is today !
give me time to get used to you .
no , get out !
conchita , open up !
open up , i said !
i'm drying myself .
one more minute !
what are you doing here?
i iet him in .
he got thrown out of his hotel .
he's slept here for the past 3 nights .
relax , we sleep back to back .
just iike you and i do .
go on , get out !
leave him alone .
out !
get iost !
leave him alone !
take your things .
i've known it since the day i met you .
deep down , you're cold and heartless .
if he goes , i go .
sure , go on , get out !
get out , the two of you !
i'ii give you ten minutes .
then i caii the police .
i'ii wait for you outside .
i've had enough of you , too .
ten minutes , you hear?
i'ii be gone before that , gladly !
but don't come running after me .
i'ii never come back .
may god be your witness !
i never want to see you again .
hear me?
never !
i can't take it anymore .

i prayed to god that you'd die after i'd ruined you .
i've said it ail , you can go now .

i thought you loved me enough to go off and kiii yourself .
i have something to say , but not here .
let me explain what happened iast night .

you think that by giving me a house , you own me .
but you don't .
you're not iistening to me?
you'ii never have me .

that scene iast night was aii a charade .
i won't teii you .

you can come whenever you want .

it's aii over now .

you can see why i spoke of kiiling her .

a number of far right terrorist groups , notably the p. a. f. and the s. t. l . c. , say they'll meet the challenge of the extreme left and contribute to this operation of total subversion .
