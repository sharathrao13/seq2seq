the expression is " colder than a witch's tit " .
you've never seen a woman's tit in your life .
shh .
be quiet , you two .
ok , thank you all very much .

i think i'll leave .
paul , sit right there .

and ...
did you hear what i said?
nothing is coming .
don't worry , paul , he always says the same thing about every number , in every show .
now how the hell do you know what i always say?
it would be better if i stepped outside .
keep playing , paul .
i'm only doing this goddamn show because you wanna play that stupid 24 year old girl .
oh , i knew sooner or later you'd say that .
you do think i'm too old for the part .
well , you're wrong .
i can play 24 years old , and i'll damn well prove it .
you wanna quit the show?
quit the show .
you don't have to do anything for me .
just don't kid yourself that you're doing this show for any reason except guilt about me .
guilt?
what guilt?
for never going one day when you were faithful to me?
oh , that guilt .
faithful , faithful ...
you're always talking about being faithful .
audrey , why do you think so small?
besides , how do i know you were faithful to me?
you know i was .
that's right , i know you were .
oh , you meant to do that .
yes , i did .
you kept me working all the time .
i never had a chance to cheat .
what is this big hang up about fidelity?
what makes being faithful the greatest friggin 'virtue in the world?
excuse me .
well , it is a great deal better than the meaningless affairs you keep tap dancing through .
those stacys , those victorias ...
you're not even fooling michelle with victoria , you know .
straighten that leg .
it is as straight as it's ever going to get .
oh , the bonnies , the wendys , the debbies , the donnas ...
i can't even remember all their names .
give me a hand .
keep playing , paul .
bet you can't either .
quick , tell me , what was the name of the girl in philadelphia?
the blonde with the television show?
oh , the blonde with the television show in philadelphia?
i remember that girl's name .

i can't remember her name .
dorothy .
dorothy .
who cares?
i can't remember her name .

he's gonna cut it .
he's gonna cut it .
oh , god , that man .
he's gonna drive me crazy .
it's showtime , folks .

it's unusual .
mm hm , very unusual .

what do you think?
i don't know about the audiences , but i think it's the best work you've ever done .
you son of a bitch .
jesus christ !
sex , sex , sex can't he ever think of anything else but sex?
that's his sickness .
nah , nothin 'i ever do is good enough .
it's not beautiful enough , it's not funny enough , it's not deep enough ...
it's not anything enough .
now , when i see a rose , that's perfect .
i mean , that's perfect .
i wanna look up to god and say " how the hell did you do that?
" and why the hell can't i do that?
that's probably one of your better con lines .
yeah , it is .
but that doesn't mean i don't mean it .
if i were god .. ,
sometimes i think i am .. ,
depends on the shit you're smoking .. ,
if i were god , man , everybody would live for ever ,
no death , man .
no pennies on the eyes for anybody .
you know , man , death is really a hip thing now ,
death is in ,
books , magazine articles , tvshows , ken and barbie dolls with a mutual suicide pact .. ,
buried them in a little shoebox ,
knew a guy who bought a pair of them , he was into doll necrophilia .
if it cuts .. ,
all right , little thing .
oooh !
it's terrific .
there's a lady in chicago , man , wrote a book .
dr kubler ross , with a dash ,
this chick , man , without the benefit of dying herself has broken the process of death into five stages ,
anger , denial , bargaining , depression and acceptance ,
that's it .
sounds like a jewish law firm ,
got time to make some changes?
not and make the screening tonight , no .
i cannot believe people are gonna see this .
