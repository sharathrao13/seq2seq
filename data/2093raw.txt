the child is dead .
he breathed just for a moment .
then he breathed no more .
the child is dead .
dead .
the child is dead .
i'm afraid it will kill her .
my god , she wanted a baby so much .
for such a long time .
what can i tell her?
what will i say?
you could adopt a child .
she wanted her own .
if i may suggest , it even resembles ...
your wife need never know .
it would be a blessing to her and to the child .
are there no relatives?
none .
the mother died , as your own child , in the same moment .
you said it could be ours , but ...
on this night , mr thorn ,
god has given you a son .
here's your boy .
good morning .
come va?
what are you doing home so early?
just came to start packing .
what?
we can't waste any time .
we're leaving in the morning .
buongiorno , carlo .
please , carlo .
what are you talking about?
i am talking about london .
i am talking about the ambassador to the court of st james .
well , what about him?
you're married to him .
i'm what?
it's me .
i'm appointed ambassador to great britain .
i've already told them yes .
i loved it the minute i saw it .
well , it's a bit much .
well , nothing's too much for the wife of the future president of the united states .
you know , you're pushy .
come on .
wait till you see this .
now this , they call his day room .
his day room .
so?
how do you like it so far?
well , it needs some books .
to warm it up .
couple of books .
warm it up .
yeah .
something in mind , mr ambassador?
why don't we have a little look upstairs?
well , there's no furniture up there , either .
you know , you could be too sexy for the white house .
i'm gonna miss you so much .
i won't be long .
we don't have that much to talk about .
since when did two old college roommates not have much to talk about?
since one of them assumed the awesome burden of the presidency .
well , give my regards to the first lady .
i'll do my best .
why don't you change you mind , fly over with me?
no , i'd better stay here and fool around with damien .
where is he?
he was right behind us ...
damien?
oh , my god , robert .
damien !
robert , where could he be?
you little monkey .
don't you ever do that again .
there you are .
go .
hooray .
run out of film?
just saving a bit for his canonisation .
how's that?
he's either the heir to the thorn millions
or jesus christ himself .
want a bite , daddy?
go on , damien .
smile .
a big birthday smile .
come on .
smile .
holly .
i'll take him , ma'am .
no , i'll take him .
come on .
one ... two ... three ...
let me jump on it , daddy .
let me jump on it .
hold on .
damien .
damien , look at me .
i'm over here .
damien , i love you .
look .
there's nanny .
look at me , damien .
it's all for you .
oh , my god .
go , tom .
morning .
have you read the papers today?
no , i haven't .
there was an article on the suicide , your nanny that jumped .
they say that she left a suicide note , sir .
not true .
mr ambassador , did you know she was on drugs?
would you mind?
mr thorn , did she use drugs?
not that i know of .
the article said ...
i don't care what the article said .
i'm sorry .
i am sorry .
will you send me a bill for the damage?
no , that's all right , mr ambassador .
let's just say you owe me .
corporal .
ok , outside .
yes?
there's a father brennan here to see you .
who?
a priest named father brennan from rome .
he says it's a matter of urgent personal business .
never heard of him .
he says he just needs a minute .
something about a hospital .
donation time .
all right , send him in .
i didn't know you were such a soft touch .
on that trip to saudi arabia , why isn't it the right time?
well , it's personal , tom .
i just don't feel like leaving home right now .
yes , father?
we haven't much time .
you must listen to what i have to say .
all right .
what is it?
you must accept christ as your saviour .
you must accept him now .
forgive me , but didn't i understand that you have a matter of urgent personal business?
you must take communion .
drink the blood of christ and eat his flesh .
only if he is within you can you defeat the son of the devil .
i see .
he's killed once .
he'll kill again .
he'll kill until everything that's yours is his .
father , would you mind ...
only through christ can you fight him .
accept the lord jesus .
drink his blood .
i've locked the door , mr thorn .
yes?
would you send for a security guard?
i beg you , mr thorn .
listen to what i have to say .
ambassador thorn?
i was at the hospital , mr thorn , the night your son was born .
i witnessed the birth .
sir?
i beg you .
all right .
stand by .
what do you want?
to save you , mr thorn .
so christ will forgive me .
what do you know about my son?
everything .
and what is that?
i saw its mother .
you saw my wife .
i saw its mother .
you're referring to my wife .
its mother , mr thorn .
this is blackmail .
come out and say it .
what are you trying to say?
his mother was a ja ...
everything ok?
you sounded strange .
the door was locked .
i want this gentleman escorted out of here .
ok , let's go .
accept christ each day .
drink his blood .
just get him off the grounds .
all right , father .
come on .
father .
thank you .
come in .
excuse me .
mrs. baylock is here .
she says she's the new governess .
well , that's a start .
show her in .
come in , please .
ambassador and mrs. thorn .
how do you do?
i know it's a difficult time for you , so i'll not intrude on your grief .
i'm here to take away some of your troubles and anxieties .
we'll soon help your little boy to forget what's happened .
i'm afraid , sir , that some of our young nannies , they get homesick , or they have boyfriend problems .
i left all that behind a long time ago .
well , now , if you il let me see your boy?
yes , of course .
he's upstairs .
i'll show you where it is .
why don't you just leave us alone at first?
let us get acquainted in our own way .
well , he's shy with new people .
oh , no .
not with me , he won't be .
well , i don't think ...
i think it'll be fine .
go on .
give it a try .
all right , then .
mrs. horton .
this way , mrs. baylock .
excuse me .
i like her .
she seems all right .
where'd you find her?
where did i find her?
yeah .
i didn't find her .
i assumed you found her .
round that corner to the right and it's the door facing you .
i'll have your things sent up in a moment .
thank you .
mrs. baylock .
yes , ma'am?
i'm sorry , but we're a little bit confused .
oh?
why's that?
well , we don't know how you got here .
the agency .
the agency?
well , yes .
they read in the paper about the ... well , about your first nanny , so they sent you another .
that's it .
i'll call to confirm that .
here are my references .
thank you very much .
well , if i could see your boy , now?
yes , of course .
thank you .
have no fear , little one .
i am here to protect thee .
in a minute , horton , i think .
very good , sir .
kathy .
i'm coming .
mrs. baylock .
mrs. baylock .
yes , ma'am?
where's damien?
if you don't mind ,
i think he'd rather go to the park .
the park?
i told you he was going with us .
he's too young for church .
he'll cause a fuss .
you don't seem to understand .
it is my wish and my husband's wish that damien accompanies us to church .
kathy .
i'll be there in a minute .
now , please have him dressed at once .
well , excuse me for speaking my mind , ma'am , but do you really think a five year old will understand the goings on of an episcopal wedding?
will you have my son dressed and in the car in five minutes?
thank you very much .
what's the matter , damien?
it's just a church , that's all .
what's the matter?
robert .
something wrong?
i don't know .
he just seems scared to death .
is he ill?
no , he's just ...
no , he's just trembling all over .
mr ambassador .
welcome , sir .
good morning .
no !
damien .
damien , stop it .
damien , stop it .
damien .
no !
horton , drive on .
are you sure that you don't wanna call a doctor?
no , it's just a couple of bruises .
it'll be all right in the morning .
no , i mean for damien .
oh , no , he's fine .
he's sound asleep .
just to have him examine him .
well , he's perfectly all right .
never been sick a day in his life .
he never has , has he? isn t that a little strange?
is it?
i mean , no measles or mumps or chickenpox .
not even a cough or a cold .
so?
i just think it's a little unusual .
look , he's a perfectly healthy boy .
i mean , we have nothing to worry about with him .
not physically or otherwise .
he just had a bad moment .
you know , like a fright .
yes?
i'm leavin 'now .
is there anything else?
nothing , thank you .
good night .
i think the best thing to do with a bad day like this is end it .
i'm gonna go to bed .
i'll be along soon .
quiet , now .
this is the master of the house .
what is this?
sir?
the dog .
beautiful , isn't he?
we found him outside .
who gave you permission to bring it in?
i thought we could use a good watchdog , sir .
and damien loves him .
gave you a fright , did he , sir?
yes .
well , you see how good he is .
as a watchdog , i mean .
i think you'll be grateful on your long trips away , sir .
mrs. baylock , we don't need a dog , and if we do , i'll pick him out myself .
damien's taken quite a fancy to him , sir .
tomorrow morning you'll call the rspca , tell them to collect the dog and find him another home .
you understand?
sir .
come on , boy .
welcome to windsor safari park .
animal compound to your left .
parking , for refreshment and zoo area , to your right .
when driving through animal compounds , please keep all car windows closed .
thank you .
thank you .
come on , darling .
let's go see the monkeys , ok?
good morning , horton .
good morning , sir .
baboons bite . keep all car windows closed .
keep all car windows closed .
baboons are dangerous .
oh , no .
all right , kathy?
yeah .
you're so silent this evening .
just tired , i guess .
sorry .
damien all right?
yeah .
you sure?
yes .
if there were anything wrong , you'd tell me , wouldn't you?
wrong?
what could be wrong with our child , robert?
we're beautiful people , aren't we?
there is something wrong , isn't there?
kathy .
is it so serious?
robert , i want ...
i need to see a psychiatrist .
i have fears .
i have such fears .
what kind of fears?
what kind?
if i told you , you'd put me away .
kathy , i love you .
i love you .
then help me .
find me a doctor .
i will .
of course i will .
keep that scrum tight .
get down low .
come on .
let it go .
let it go .
bring him down .
well done .
i don't know what you're clapping for .
you just lost a bet .
that's right .
27 3?
right .
that'll be three quid .
i thought it was two .
inflation .
haven't you heard , old boy?
well done , george .
great stuff .
it was a good game .
go and have a quick drink with the lads .
that'll give me time to make sure everything's set up .
tomorrow , half past two , bishop's park .
five minutes and you'll never see me again .
your wife is in danger .
she'll die unless you come .
father .
thanks again .
get on with it .
say what you have to say .
when the jews return to zion , and a comet rips the sky , and the holy roman empire rises , then you and i must die .
from the eternal sea he rises , creating armies on either shore , turning man against his brother , till man exists no more .
the book of revelations predicted it all .
i'm not here to listen to a sermon .
it is by means of a human personality entirely in his possession that satan will wage his last and formidable offence .
you said that my wife ...
go to the town of megiddo in the old city of jezreel .
there , see the old man bugenhagen .
he alone can say how the child must die .
look here ...
he who will not be saved by the lamb will be torn by the beast .
will you stop?
i'm here because you said my wife is in danger .
she is pregnant .
you're mistaken .
that's nonsense .
he will not allow the child to be born .
he will kill it while it slumbers in the womb .
what are you talking about?
your son , mr thorn .
the son of the devil .
he will kill the unborn child , then he will kill your wife , and when he is certain to inherit all that is yours , then , mr thorn , he will kill you .
that's enough !
with your power , he will establish his counterfeit kingdom here , receiving his power directly from satan .
you're insane .
he must die , mr thorn .
you asked for five minutes , and you've got five minutes .
go to the city of megiddo .
see bugenhagen before it's too late .
now , i've heard you .
i want you to hear me .
i never want to see you again .
you'll see me in hell , mr thorn .
there will we share out our sentence .
no !
mrs. baylock .
anything wrong?
i just can't stand that noise .
it's not all that bad .
good morning , damien .
good morning , daddy .
what are we gonna do?
hold my hands .
right .
mrs. baylock .
yes , ma'am?
would you take him out of here , please?
he's only playing .
would you just get him out of here , please?
yes , ma'am .
come along , damien .
excuse me , sir .
come along .
darling , i don't know what's the matter with me .
i just ...
i just don't seem to be able to ...
i don't know .
kathy , i love you .
if this is what the doctor's doing to you , don't you think it's time i had a talk with him?
yes , you should .
there's something he wants to talk to you about , anyway .
oh?
robert , i don't ever want to have any more children .
all right .
then you'll agree to an abortion?
i'm pregnant , robert .
i just found out this morning .
yes?
yes , this is he .
who?
who?
but ...
hello?
hello?
something about the newspapers .
well , she knew how much you wanted one .
now she can't cope .
she searches for reasons that won't make her feel inadequate .
she has these fantasies .
she fantasises that your child is alien and that your child is evil .
she thinks that the child is evil?
the point is , at this time , another child would be disastrous .
well , in what way evil?
now , this is just fantasy .
she also thinks the child isn't hers .
the most important thing for you to do is to agree to an abortion .
no .
i'd like to know your reason .
it was foretold that this pregnancy would be terminated .
i'm going to fight to see that it's not .
forgive me , doctor .
please don't leave .
i'm sorry .
i must get home .
damien .
no , no , no , no !
no !
no !
are there any developments on the state of your wife , sir?
how is your wife , mr ambassador?
is there any news , sir?
ambassador thorn?
yes .
doctor?
my name is becker .
is she all right?
well , she will recover .
she's in there .
bed by the window .
she has a concussion and a broken humerus , and , well , some internal bleeding .
internal bleeding?
yes .
but she's pregnant .
no .
she's lost it?
afraid so .
you know , you've got a lot to be grateful for .
she's still alive .
and , with proper care , she can still have children .
robert .
robert .
don't let him kill me .
don't let him kill me .
kathy .
it's all right .
yes?
i'm sorry to bother you , ambassador thorn .
who is this?
my name is keith jennings , sir .
the photographer whose camera got smashed .
would it be possible to have a word with you at my flat?
if it's about the camera ...
no , it's not about the camera .
it's about you , mr thorn .
and the death of the priest .
go on .
do you notice anything unusual?
no .
sorry .
at first i thought this was just a fault in the film .
a strange coincidence .
then it happened again .
interesting , don't you think?
and this , i took on the day that you were at the rugby match .
same thing?
only it's more pronounced and it's actually making contact with the body .
the rest , of course history .
i can't explain it .
that's why i started digging .
the coroner's report shows that he was riddled with cancer .
high on morphine most of the time .
injected himself two or three times a day .
he knew that he was dying?
apparently , yes .
he said that he wanted to be forgiven by christ .
externally , his body was normal , except for one thing on the inside of his right thigh .
what is it?
three sixes .
six hundred and sixty six .
concentration camp?
that's what i thought .
but the biopsy says it's a birthmark .
the best is yet to come .
pages of the bible .
thousands of 'em .
every inch of wall space covered , even the windows .
he even needed to be close to his church .
there are 47 .
i counted them .
i think he was trying to keep something out , don't you?
the police thought he was insane .
they let me come here to see if i could find anything .
the first item is a diary .
it didn't say anything about him .
it's about you .
what time you left the house , where you went , what restaurants you had your lunch in , what time your speaking engagements were .
the last entry says that he was supposed to have met you in bishop's park .
and that was dated the day he died .
the important items are here .
if we re to get to the bottom of this , we've got to start here .
this first clipping is from the astrologer's monthly .
reports an unusual phenomenon .
a comet changed its shape into a glowing star ,
like the star of bethlehem 2, 000 years ago .
this one was on the other side of the world , the european continent , five years ago .
6 june , to be exact .
does that date mean anything to you?
yes .
then you'll recollect this other clipping .
it's a birth announcement from a rome newspaper .
also dated 6 june , five years ago .
the day your son was born .
the sixth month , sixth day .
was your son born at 6am?
yes , i'm sorry .
i'm just trying to work out this birthmark .
the three sixes .
my son is dead .
i don't know whose son i'm raising .
if you wouldn't mind , i'd like to help you try and find out .
no .
it's my problem .
no , sir , you're wrong .
it's my problem too .
when i came here with the police , i took some photographs .
i happened to catch sight of my own reflection in that mirror .
i know you must think i'm crazy , but i'm so frightened .
don't be afraid .
you'll be all right here .
you'll be perfectly all right .
some all right !
what about damien?
i'll speak to mrs. horton .
she'll look after him .
mrs. horton?
mrs. baylock .
sir .
where's mrs. horton?
gone .
gone out?
no , they've gone .
they just got up and went .
they left an address for you to send their last month's wages to .
well , didn't mrs. horton say anything?
didn't horton leave any explanation?
no .
but don't worry , sir .
i can manage .
i'll look into this when i get back .
just as you wish , sir .
and mrs. baylock?
sir?
last night , i saw that dog in damien's room .
i clearly told you ...
he's gone now , sir .
they took him away this morning .
no .
this is the right address .
apparently , there was a terrible fire and the old hospital burned down .
five years ago .
ok .
but surely the fire didn't destroy everything .
there must have been some records .
i sorry .
i think everything was destroyed .
isn't it possible there were some papers stored elsewhere?
i do not know .
sister .
this is most important to me .
i adopted a child here .
i'm searching for some records of it ...
there were no adoptions here .
there was one .
no , signore .
it wasn't an actual adoption .
you are mistake .
wait .
birth records .
if i gave you a date .
an exact date .
it's no use .
the fire started in the hall of records in the basement .
all the paperwork was there .
went up like a torch .
shot up the stairwells .
the third floor became an inferno .
the third floor?
the maternity wards .
nothing left but ashes .
you will excuse me?
what about the staff?
surely some survived .
si , some .
there was a tall man , a priest .
dark eyes .
piercing eyes .
yes .
he was principale .
yes , he was in charge .
is he ...
yes , he is alive .
is he here?
no .
where?
he's in a monastero in frosinone .
many were taken there .
many die .
perhaps he is die since , but he lived through the fire .
i remember people say it was un miracolo .
frosinone?
here we are .
what is it?
" when the jews return to zion ...
that's the poem .
when the jews return to zion ...
and there was something about a comet .
yes , that's here too .
the shower of stars and the rise of the roman empire .
these are supposed to be the events that signal the birth of the antichrist .
the devil's child .
it's making more sense .
the jews have returned to zion and there has been a comet .
as for the rise of the roman empire , scholars think that could well mean the common market , the treaty of rome .
bit of a stretch .
what about this?
" he shall rise from the eternal sea .
that's the poem again .
from the eternal sea he rises , creating armies on either shore .
that was the beginning of it .
theologians have interpreted the " eternal sea " as meaning the world of politics , the sea that constantly rages with turmoil and revolution .
so the devil's child will rise from the world of politics .
looks like this is as far as we go .
let's have a look .
found him?
his mind is active , but since the fire he's not made a sound .
we feed him and take care of his needs .
and we pray for his recovery when his penance is completed .
what penance?
woe to the shepherd who abandons his sheep .
may his right arm wither and his right eye lose its sight .
he's fallen from grace .
can you tell us why?
for abandoning christ .
how do you know he's abandoned christ?
he told us .
but he doesn't speak .
there is some movement in his left hand .
he was able to write it down .
you will notice the curved line over the head .
this indicates the hood of the monk .
his own hood .
the three sixes .
six is the sign of the devil .
but why three of them?
we believe it signifies the diabolical trinity .
the devil , antichrist and false prophet .
father , son and holy ghost .
for everything holy , there is something unholy .
this is the essence of temptation .
father spiletto , my name is thorn .
there was a child .
i want to know where that child came from .
i am afraid that ...
you confessed to them .
now confess to me .
what happened?
please , signore .
you said you knew its mother .
where is she now?
i must insist that you do not ...
i beg you , where is she?
answer me .
answer .
excuse me .
cervet .
please , does it mean something to you?
cerveteri .
it is an old cemetery from etruscan times .
cripta sant 'angelo .
it is nothing but ruins .
where is this place?
but there is nothing there .
only graves .
where is it?
you will find it on the map .
it is perhaps 50km north of rome .
robert , over here .
maria scianna .
my god .
june 6 .
five years ago .
bambino scianna .
infant boy .
same date .
in birth and death , the generations embrace .
is my son buried here?
this woman could be the mother of the child you adopted .
why here in this terrible place?
no .
oh , my god .
the other one .
no .
let's get out of here .
if it's an animal too , then maybe my child is alive somewhere .
they murdered him .
they murdered him as soon as he was born .
murderers .
murderers .
come on .
robert .
don't run .
it's only the smell of the graves .
run .
robert .
hello?
hello .
kathy?
hello , robert .
is that you?
i'm so glad you called .
kathy , darling .
now , listen to me very carefully .
do just what i say .
i want you to leave london right now .
what do you mean , leave london , darling?
i've put through a call to the embassy .
tom portman will meet you at the hospital and bring you here to rome .
robert , what's happened?
what's wrong?
please , darling .
just do it .
get ready to leave .
robert , i don't think i can move very well .
kathy , do it .
ok .
yes , all right , i'll try to be ready by the time he gets here .
all right , darling .
who is that?
is that somebody there?
tom?
is that you?
yes?
yes , this is he .
tom?
kathy?
tom ,
i can't talk now .
robert .
i found out about the town of megiddo .
it's derived from the word " armageddon " .
the end of the world .
it's underground , about 60 miles south of jerusalem .
there's some excavation going on there .
if only you could remember the name of the man you're supposed to see .
it's bugenhagen .
he was an exorcist .
i read about him .
that was his name .
and i remember the poem .
when the jews return to zion , and a comet fills the sky and the holy roman empire rises , then you and i must die .
from the eternal sea he rises , creating armies on either shore turning man against his brother till man exists no more .
kathy is dead .
i want damien to die , too .
hello , mr thorn .
i am bugenhagen .
what is this place?
the city of jezreel .
town of megiddo .
the place where christianity began .
the little priest is he dead yet?
yes .
yes .
come along , mr thorn .
we had better get to work .
you will excuse us .
this is for mr thorn alone .
all right .
it must be done on hallowed ground .
a church .
his blood must be spilled on the altar of god .
this first knife is most important .
it extinguishes physical life and forms the centre of the cross .
the subsequent placings extinguish spiritual life and should radiate outward .
like this .
this is not a human child .
make no mistake .
is there proof?
oh , yes .
he bears a birthmark .
