we will still show our commitment to this country .
i appreciate that .
thank you , sir .
i wanna thank everybody .
this has been a difficult
time .
london , paris , athens , rome ,
belfast , beirut .
we're not the first city to have to deal with terrorism .
and tel aviv ...
and tel aviv .
the day after they bombed the market in tel aviv , the market was open .
this is new york city .
we can take it .
god !
it's the watley school .
not kids !
one of the moms was carrying a gun .
wounds the guy as he's planting the device .
he kills her , then he locks them all in the room .
any kids get hurt?
i don't know .
i don't know .
it's over there on the table .
i don't know if it's a radio or a timer or what .
whoa , hold right there .
see if you can move in closer on the device .
right there .
focus that .
radio device .
he's got a radio control .
what the fuck's the media doing?
they must be monitoring our frequency .
danny , your boys were supposed to call the faa to clear the airspace .
do it now !
this is nypd .
get those fuckin 'birds outta here !
hub !
everybody out .
need some help here .
it's all right , come on .
hurry down the hall .
either we answer this threat quickly and convincingly , or next week there'll be a hundred more all over the world .
sounds great , general .
except why can't we find out who's behind it?
it seems to me conventional law enforcement isn't up to the task .
how about who's behind who's behind this?
uh , libya , iran , iraq .
possibly syria .
ask a question , get an atlas .
all is i know is that we must respond .
excellent idea , senator .
how do we do that?
find out who they are and bomb the shit out of 'em .
and if we can't find out?
look , i hate to be the voice of doom , but it keeps escalating .
a bus , then a theatre .
what's next?
how about sending in the national guard?
the national guard is for riot control , not for counter terrorism .
the army then .
i've read the contingency plans .
it's established legal doctrine that the army may not be turned against our own people .
even if that's what our own people are asking for , three to one?
if the president declares a state of ...
lincoln declared martial law in 1862 !
he suspended habeas corpus .
which was later found unconstitutional .
ex parte milligan .
i've got an election in november .
ex united states congressman .
let's save the quips for the talk shows .
the president's plane lands in two hours .
we owe it to him to have a consensus .
you don't fight ajunkyard dog with aspca rules .
what you do is you take the leash off your own bigger , meaner dog .
general?
the army's a broadsword , not a scalpel .
trust me , senator , you do not want the army in an american city .
but how long would it take to deploy?
we can't go in until the president invokes the war powers act .
i understand that , general .
let's assume the order has been given .
12 hours after the president gives the order , we can be on the ground .
one light infantry division of 10, 700 men .
elements of the rapid deployment force , special forces ,
delta , apcs , helicopters , tanks , and , of course , the ubiquitous m 16 a 1 assault rifle .
a humble enough weapon until you see it held by a man outside your local 7 eleven .
it will be noisy , it will be scary .
it will not be mistaken for a vfw parade .
i remind you , general devereaux does not speak for official army policy .
a police function has become accepted as our role in haiti and somalia .
make no mistake .
we will hunt down the enemy , we will find the enemy and we will kill the enemy .
and no card carrying member of the aclu is more dead set against it than i am .
which is why i urge you ,
i implore you , do not consider this as an option .
i know just what the president's going to say .
that's exactly why you're the only man for the job .
i'd like to introduce anthony hubbard , my ascac on the ground in brooklyn .
his team was able to take out the first cell within 36 hours of the attack on the 87 bus .
he's also the man who took out the terrorist in that schoolhouse .
hub?
the job of the fbi is to ... to respond .
the job of the army is to defend .
with the presence of the army , our ability to investigate will be inhibited .
it will push these criminals further underground .
you can't fight an enemy you can't see .
i think if we exercise patience , restraint , allow our men and women up in new york to do theirjob ,
i think we'll be effective .
thank you .
l , too , think we should proceed with caution .
some of you may not know sharon bridger .
sharon was posted in iraq as part of our covert operations during the gulf war .
sharon?
sir , if i may?
thank you .
i'm sure everyone here knows the traditional model of the terrorist network .
one cell controls all others .
cut off the head , the body will wither .
unfortunately , the old wisdom no longer applies .
the new paradigm is each cell operates independent of the other .
cut off one head , another rises up in its place .
bus 87 was the work of the first cell , whose remaining elements , we believe , the fbi took down .
this then activated the work of cell two .
the theatre gala .
at most , we believe there are three , possibly four , cells .
then how much longer before we can take out the last cell?
we don't know .
this is a tragedy of staggering proportion .
one federal plaza was the headquarters of the fbi counter terrorism task force as well as other federal agencies .
authorities are withholding the names of those who died .
letters of condolence have been received from leaders around the world .
boris yeltsin forwarded a message condemning terrorism ...
body count's a little over 200 so far .
what about our people?
mike , tina , they were all in there working .
hub .
hub .
this is colonel hardwick , army intelligence .
colonel .
i'm here as an adviser only .
i intend to keep a low profile .
appreciate your concern .
i don't mean to be insensitive , but what are your capabilities at this point?
your infrastructure?
you're standing on our infrastructure .
excuse me .
hey , hub , they managed to get a partial vln number off the van .
dmv says it was stolen the day before near ...
brooklyn?
you got it .
hub , the final body countjust came in .
600 dead .
very sorry about your friends .
frank , it's uh ...
sharon .
i didn't catch your last name .
bridger .
how you doin '?
been better .
well , the agency came up with another list of probables .
we should circulate them .
hey !
this stuff might be good .
why was there no warning from samir?
he didn't know anything .
says samir .
says me !
maybe i'll ask him .
yeah , over my dead body .
over 600 dead bodies .
he's one of the good guys .
how can you be sure?
because he was part of the operation to destabilise saddam hussein with me , ok?
he's a go between .
he risked his life for us .
go between who , sharon?
i need names , ok?
i need ... photographs or something .
i don't need a history lesson .
i can't give you pictures , i don't know what they look like .
so you got nothing?
i've got samir .
does samir have any contact with them?
minimal .
so how does he do it?
he can't .
they initiate .
and otherwise?
he's waiting .
he's waiting? !
what the hell is he waiting for?
more bodies , more buildings !
maybe he's waiting to blow up a few more !
i know how you must feel .
you don't know how i feel .
i lost friends of mine tonight .
they'll make contact soon .
when? !
that's what i wanna know .
when?
why soon?
why not now?
what is the tradecraft?
what are the visuals , the iron sites?
you know , all that cla spy shit !
i tell you what i'm gonna do .
i'm gonna take your boy samir downtown , strap his ass to a polygraph machine , and i'm gonna ask him questions about you .
then i'm gonna take those transcripts to a friend of mine at the new york times , who writes about the link between the cla and political horror shows .
if you burn him , you lose your one chance !
so what? !
it's lose or lose , you said .
i'm not fucking with you !
how could you remember who you're fucking?
24 hours .
for what?
24 hours for what , sharon?
elise !
have anything for me?
nothing new .
we've got three bombings in new york city , we've got 600 people dead .
uh , the nypd , the fbl , they don't seem up to it .
do we need to bring the army in?
absolutely .
how many have to die before we do bring the army in?
troops are not trained to police their own population .
that's why we have an fbi and a police force .
we don't want an army in brooklyn .
you would have to speak to the army to verify those rumours .
and here we have the fbl , having failed to do their job ...
this is an attack , a time of war .
the fact it's inside our borders means it's a new kind of war .
this is what these towel heads do in their country .
now they're bringing it here !
people must understand the word arab is not synonymous with the word terrorist .
islam is a religion of peace .
these people defile the koran when they use its words .
a merchant , abdul hassam , was beaten today ...
one of our greatest freedoms is the freedom from fear .
he pledged to protect that freedom .
the fbl's received another fax .
ahmed bin talal .
apparently , they still believe that we have him .
do we ... " have him "?
let me give you a little advice , steve .
do not come between me and the president .
i am speaking for the president .
as far as the president is concerned , no , we do not have him .
general , did you know that after yesterday's attack , half the parents in this country kept their kids out of school .
they're attacking our way of life .
it ends now !
are you saying the president is prepared to take the necessary steps?
i am saying the president is prepared to be presidential .
hello?
it's me .
turn on the tv .
hang on .
the senate was in session late into the night , debating the president's call for martial law .
we have a tradition of invoking martial law ...
i got it . only when the most dire of circumstances require it , but at what cost?
all eyes now turn to new york city to see if martial law will bring the terror to an end .
move out !
good morning .
today with the invocation of the war powers act by the president , i am declaring a state of martial law in this city .
to the best of our knowledge , we are opposed by no more than 20 of the enemy .
he is hiding among a population of roughly two million .
intelligence tells us that he is most likely arab speaking , between 14 and 30 , narrowing the target to 15, 000 suspects .
we can further reduce that number down to those that have been here under six months .
now you have 20 hiding among 2, 000 .
if you are one of these 20 young men , you can hide among a population of similar ethnic background .
unfortunately , you can only hide there .
and that population , in the classic immigration pattern , is concentrated .
right here , in brooklyn .
we intend to seal off this borough .
then we will squeeze it .
this is the land of opportunity , gentlemen .
the opportunity to turn yourselves in .
after sundown tonight , any young man fitting the profile i described , who has not cooperated , will be arrested and detained .
there is nothing more corrosive to the morale of a population than policing its citizens , but the enemy would be mistaken if they were to doubt our resolve .
they are face to face with the most fearsome military machine , and i intend to use it and be back on base in time for the play offs .
thank you .
good to see you again .
can't say the same about you .
not in that uniform .
i thought you were against it .
i am .
this was not my call .
so the president made you put tanks on the brooklyn bridge?
you questioning my patriotism?
i'm questioning yourjudgment .
i'm serving my president .
possibly not in the best interests of our nation , but my job does not let me make that distinction .
i won't question your patriotism , but don't ever question my command , understand?
i'm not under your command .
you really believe that?
take a look around .
tell me if you really think that's true .
arrogant prick .
you ever met anybody so in love with the sound of his own voice?
we're putting samir in play .
now?
he'll freak .
yeah , he'll freak .
i'm already freaked .
oh , fuck it !
one more lamb to the slaughter .
hey , hey , hey !
it's fine .
he's cool .
what he fucking doing here? !
you know they're killing arabs out there !
you can stop it , samir .
what do you mean?
the army's here .
they're setting up interrogation centres and torturing people !
calm down , all right?
i got to get out of here and you have to help me !
we'll help you !
i just need more money .
ok .
you got a student visa for ali waziri .
i told you .
i know nobody of that name .
liar !
tell him what he wants to know !
he knows !
this woman's crazy !
i think you just don't know who they are .
they'd never trust me !
look , i've got a picture of the two of us , samir .
remember it?
i'm gonna post it in every shop in brooklyn and send copies to friends in the west bank .
your mother's still there , isn't she?
fuckin 'let go of me !
get outta here !
get out !
i'm sorry .
hey , nobody's gonna burn you .
ok , samir?
nobody's gonna call anybody .
who asked you to get the visa?
oh , come on .
hey , hey , samir .
just calm down , ok?
there's nothing to be afraid of .
i'm afraid of going to hell .
me , too .
his name is tariq husseini .
he runs an auto shop on commerce street in red hook .
commerce street .
red hook .
anybody bothers you , anybody , you call me .
you're good .
you're not so bad yourself .
hey , floyd .
yeah .
hub .
listen , we gotta put something together in a hurry , all right?
yeah , where's frank?
all right , well , give him a 911 .
ok , get a beat up car for me .
beat it up yourself if you have to .
896 commerce street .
it's a garage in red hook .
yeah .
oh , shit !
they're going house to house .
you know , tariq'll go underground .
we're gonna hit him in less than an hour .
well , hit him hard .
where you going?
i'm gonna go stash samir someplace safe .
right , i make out three inside .
the two guys by the trash barrel are ours .
they'll wait till we're set , then come in after us .
ok .
all right , let's roll .
yo , joaqun .
mira ...
i'm looking for tariq .
anybody know tariq?
supposed to be fixin 'my shit here .
huh?
i got the card somewhere .
he gave me this paper .
tariq hassiny or something like that .
yeah , he's back there .
back there?
all right , man .
thanks .
hey , tariq .
are you tariq husseini?
he's not here .
he's not here?
can i leave a message for him?
of course .
tell him the fbi is after him .
you're joking !
i'm notjoking .
put the phone down , put your hands up .
hands in the air !
put 'em behind your head .
yeah , to you too .
everything's gonna be all right .
tariq husseini , this is the us army .
you are surrounded .
you have 30 seconds to throw out any weapons and exit the premises with your hands on top of your head .
i repeat : this is the us army ...
freeze !
goddamn it !
goddamn it !
code red !
code red !
bravo one to alpha leader .
request permission to fire .
yes !

freeze !
put the gun down !

all right .
i'm f ...
i'm fbl .

all right .
i'm f ...
i'm fbl !

ladies and gentlemen , there'll be a pool briefing for all accredited journalists ...

the perimeter ...
frankie !
frankie haddad !
frank haddad !
frank !
hub !
hub , they got frankie .

my kid's in here someplace .
he's only 13 !
all right , we'll get him out .
we'll find him .
frank haddad !
ow !
they came into my house !
my wife told them who i was !
frank !
how many times did i put it on the line?
how many times !?
20 years we're american citizens .
10 in the bureau !
all right .
they knocked her down , they took him out of my house !
frank haddad !
listen to me !
listen to me .
frank !
it's wrong .
w we'll find him .
all right?
we'll find him .
come on , come on .
no .
no !
i'll find him .
besides ... this is where i belong .
here .
tell them i'm not their sand nigger any more .
you say his name is haddad?
no , had dad .
frank haddad .
h a d d a d. junior .
his father's a shiite .
we're checking him out .
his father is a federal agent my partner !
don't get in my face .
i might decide you're an ethiopian .
you're stupid to think that's an insult .
if there's a mistake , we'll fix it .
there's no mistake .
i'm vouching for the kid .
i want him out !
get your priorities straight .
we'll look into it .
yeah , you'll look into it , just like you been looking into me , right?
you think i don't know what's goin 'on?
i'm doin 'yourjob for you and i damn near get my head blown off !
now i want frank junior out and i wanna see my prisoner tariq husseini !
let's go see your prisoner .
how long have you been at it?
not long enough , apparently .
how much longer before he gives up the other cells?
he can't , if he doesn't know where they are .
he knows .
he doesn't .
you said it yourself , sharon , in the strategy meeting .
one cell doesn't know where the other one is .
how long before he breaks , sharon?
too long .
the theatre was hit nine hours after we took down the first cell .
so , what other models do we have?
shaking?
won't work .
works for the israelis .
only in conjunction with sleep deprivation .
it takes 36 hours .
we don't have 36 hours .
electric shock?
the neurotransmitters just shut down .
water?
palestinian authorities produce good intel with water .
there's cutting .
it's extremely messy .
are you people insane?
what are you talking about?
the time has come for one man to suffer to save hundreds of lives .
one man !
what about two or six?
how about public executions?
feel free to leave whenever you like .
come on , general .
you lost men , i lost men , but you , you , you can't do this .
what if what they want ...
what if they don't want the sheik?
have you considered that?
huh?
what if what they want is for us to herd children into stadiums like we're doing?
and put soldiers on the street and have americans looking over their shoulders?
bend the law , shred the constitution .
because if we torture him , general ...
we do that , and everything that we have bled and fought and died for is over .
and they've won .
they've already won !
escort him out .
he knew nothing .
call off the dogs .
we can't call off the army
until the threat is gone .
the army is the threat .
devereaux's killing innocent people .
you took the leash off him .
just put it back on .
you wearing a wire?
are you?
it was devereaux who took the sheik in the first place .
devereaux?
so we do have him .
what d'you think , hub?
our government operates as one coherent entity?
everybody , you and me , we all wanted that sheik's head .
devereaux didn't start this agenda about hunting terrorists , he just pushed it a bit .
hang on a second .
so , now , what do we do?
there is this feeling in certain circles that we should let the sheik go , set him free .
after all , we kidnapped him , kept him in isolation .
judge might let him walk .
you don't free a murderer , any murderer .
any murderer !
sharon thinks we can get to the last cell , if they believe we're gonna release the sheik .
why should they trust her?
why should i trust her?
ask her .
i ran the network in iraq for two years .
samir recruited them from among the sheik's followers and i , uh , trained them in the north .
the sheik was gonna help us overthrow saddam .
i mean , he was our ally .
we were financing him .
then , uh ... then there was a policy shift .
it's not like we sold them out exactly .
we just stopped helping them .
they were slaughtered .
so i , uh , quit the operation .
i took another assignment .
but you helped 'em first .
what d'you mean?
you said they needed to get help .
they were on the terrorist watch list , so you got 'em visas , you and samir .
i promised them we would take care of them .
they were working for us .
doing what ... exactly?
i told you !
no , you didn't .
you told me that you trained them .
tradecraft , subversion .
that's what you said , wasn't it?
you're leaving something out , aren't you , sharon?
you taught them ... how to make bombs .
that's why you were looking for the wiring signatures on that blue bus .
and now they're here doing what you taught them how to do .
right?
you've gotta let me make this right .
please?
the president is in conference with the mayor , the governor and the attorney general of new york . ... putting them in a stadium , as we did with the japanese .
this is the time for all of us to proclaim our brotherhood with these people . ... the military to take back , in a peaceful fashion , our democracy from the people ...
the people of brooklyn will not be held hostage !
join community and religious leaders in a march to protest the mass ...
well , what if it was black people?
huh?
what if it was italians?
american arabs are a vulnerable , visible population , and they have no power .
farouk?
critics say this is racist and the government would not do this ...
samir has made contact , frank .
it's the last cell .
he set up a meeting , but we gotta get the army off our tail .
i need your help , frank .
frank , it's still our watch .
i don't wanna see another dead body and i know you don't .
and when this is over , i promise you we'll get your boy back .
march on city hall today .
no fear !
what time you got , frank?
just 10 . 15 .
how's he doing?
tell me the message and i will pass it on .
i need to deliver it myself .
believe me , they're gonna wanna hear what i have to say .
no fear !
tell 'em we're not afraid !
sure he'll go through with this?
well , if he doesn't , he knows i'll give him to devereaux .
so?
you know , this is the endgame , you understand?
if this goes wrong ...
nothing's gonna go wrong .
we're the cla .
something always goes wrong !
well ...
if things get hairy , uh ... just remember the most committed wins .
let's go .
the three of you really do make a lovely couple .
sharon , i beg you .
do not make me do this .
they ...
i mean , if they even dr ...
if they even dream we've been followed , they will kill us .
south on cadman plaza .
relax , all right?
general , the feds are in motion .
do you copy?
right , just stay with hubbard .
the man is not on our team .
roger that .
airborne , he's all yours .
this is airborne .
we got him .
sound garden's ready .
this is not the way to the bathhouse .
he said to get a key from my uncle .
stop whining , you'll feel the surveillance .
i had a bad feeling , you know?
just relax .
keep your head down .
we ready?
we're all set .
we got to hurry , sharon .
we can't be late .
here we go .
all units !
all units !
subject is on foot !
he's running to front and pearl .
this is the us army .
stop , or we will open fire !
freeze !
we're all clear .
right , let's do it .
why we still here?
we got to go .
calm down .
it's gonna be fine .
look , we'll have to sit tight for three minutes .
can you just do that much for me?
i can't believe it .
look at this .
arab and jew , side by side .
black and white , christian and muslim .
what?
it's so tragic .
wh what's tragic?
what do you mean?
are they gonna hit the march?
can you imagine a better target? ... because our government has no right to declare martial law !
no fear !
no fear !
no fear !
we got to hurry , sharon .
ok .
here , put this on .
shit , it's 11 o'clock .
we gotta go .
they're getting ready to move .
units 1 and 2 , on my signal .
units 3 and 4 , stand by .
units 5 and 6 ...
fbl !
oh ...
microwave !
this is an unlawful disturbance .
you must disperse .
i repeat , these soldiers carry live ammunition .
this is your final warning .
hub , we missed him .
the bathhouse .
so what's going on?
why aren't they here?
they'll be here .
don't worry .
what are you doing?
what message do you have for them?
there's no one else coming , is there?
so , what message do you have for me , sharon?
you're the last cell .
there will never be a last cell !
it's just the beginning .
no fear !
no fear !
how could i have missed the play?
it's because of the money .
you believe money is power .
belief is power .
just don't tell me we financed your operation .
the world is a wheel , sharon .
samir , the koran preaches ...
do not speak to me of the koran , woman !
first , you left me there in iraq like a piece of shit !
and then you take our leader , a holy man .
you put him in prison for preaching the word of god .
so now you have to learn the consequences of trying to tell the world how to live .
it's over .
your point's been made .
why shed more blood?
those poor people out there ...
they're fucking marching for your cause .
yeah .
and they , too , will become its martyrs .
samir !
let her go .
away from the door !
he's got a bomb !
get up .
get up .
get up !
no !
samir , let her go and you'll live .
move away from this fuckin 'door !
don't !
samir ...
hub , i'm here .
no shots , frank .
samir .
do you wanna die?
do you?
look , i blow it !
then we all die .
nobody's leaving here .
move away from this door !
shoot .
shut up .
shoot !
shut up !
shoot me !
i'm coming !
shut up !
shoot !!
i'm coming !
do it !
shoot !
shoot !
one of ours down .
stomach wound .
get here now .
here .
is he dead?
hub ...
sh !
i'm right here .
i'm right here .
hub?
uh ...
i'm right here .
sh sh sh .
i'm sorry .
it's ok .
are you ok?
i'm cold .
ok .
forgive us our trespasses , as we forgive those who trespass against us .
and lead us ...
and lead us not into temptation , but deliver us from evil .
for thine is the kingdom ...
inshallah .
no fear !
no fear !
agent hubbard , would you explain to me why you detained colonel hardwick and six of my staff?
the last cell was taken down .
it was samir .
we took him out .
how can you be sure it's the last cell?
sharon .
sharon's been compromised .
sharon is dead .
she gave her life .
sorry , hub .
it's all over with , general .
what is?
the sheik .
is that so?
clear violation of international law .
