never found out why you left him
but this answer begs that question
too blind to see tomorrow too broke to beg or borrow
span the distance bridge the border
beg forgiveness round the corner again
one more point of contention
i need some intervention
approaching failing tensions

heya , fuckface .
mornin ', dude .
come on , ozzy .
it's show time .
ozzy , before you go to ann arbor to pick up heather , i wanna show you what you're missing .

there's little hearts on her panties !
come on , look , you pussy .

what the fuck , man?
come on !
i'm disappointed in you .
here it is , the end of our freshman year and you screwed one girl .
one .
you're a disgrace to men everywhere .
look at the stifmeister .
i got laid 23 times this year , and i'm not counting the hummer i got in the library stacks , baby .
all right , here's a new idea for you , stifler , okay?
you find a girl .
you two become best friends .
you don't bother counting how many times you have sex with each other .
you just laugh at the people that do count .
here's a new idea for you .
i'll get you a spoon so you can eat my ass .
okay , people .
notebooks closed .
let's get this exam rolling .
holy shit , dude .
we got an exam today?
you kiddin 'me?
bullshit .
yes !
i'm never even gonna think about political science again .
hey .
how'd you do?
oh , fine .
yeah?
i can't believe i'm doing this summer abroad thing .
last thing i need is more classes .
you're gonna have a great time .
hello , summer !
did that exam blow or what?
yeah , it sucked .
ozzy !
kev , what's up , man?
how are you?
good .
put your party hat on .
we got 12 weeks of immortality ahead .
yes , sir !
weird .
ah , the one that got away , huh , son?
yeah .
yeah .
well , evidently you two made quite the handsome couple on the internet .
oh , i didn't see it .
it , uh , was brought up at a p. t. a. meeting .
anyway , my point is , these little sexual debacles should not get you down , because you know what?
it happens to the best of us .
in fact , the first time your mother and i ... got together ,
i used a condom .
well , she referred to it as " shrink wrapping .
but i got over it .
anyway , keep your chin up .
you keep plugging ... and , uh , good things will happen .
good to have you home , son .
it's good to be home , dad .
it's gonna be nice to hit stifler's tonight after exams .
did you get through 'em?
there's the mystery man !
finch , how are you?
kevin .
konichiwa .
james .
konichiwa .
konichiwa .

what are you talkin 'about?
well , times change , people change .
it's just what happens , you know .
kev , listen .
go into my old room .
my friends and i knew that it was up to us to stick together .
you remember my first college summer?
we rented that lake house in grand harbor .
we treated every day out there like it was a post prom party .
hell of a time .
we capped it all off with a massive blowout .
best ever .
it was legendary .
my advice is do that .
by the end of the summer , you're gonna see the big picture .
i love adventure nothing's better to me
she's on the phone .
she's on the phone .
it's long distance .
who?
nadia !
nadia !
what?
new york .
she's on hello .
yes , dear , he's right here .
here .
wait .
now remember
yes , i am sure to go see the lion king .
right .
and don't ride the subway after midnight .
okay .
i know they've done wonderful things with that city , but , you know , for me
dad !
he's right hang on .
hey hey , nadia .
jim !
how was college?
college was excellent .
yeah .
yeah , it was it was really excellent .
you have not forgotten about me , have you?
no .
i , uh absolutely not .
i definitely didn't .
good , because guess what?
i'm coming to see you at the end of summer .
i hope you're ready for me ... because i have not forgotten about you either , you sexy boy .
shit .
jim , you can eat hot dogs tomorrow .
no , no , finch , it's not the hot dogs .
nadia called me this morning .
she's coming here at the end of the summer and she wants to see me .
oh , that's killer .
yeah , that's a good thing .
no , not " good thing .
not " killer .
i'll never be able to do it .
nadia is gonna be expecting filet mignon .
okay , and all i'm gonna be able to give her ... is rump roast .
aw , come on .
jim , you've had experience since nadia .
ah , yes , you would be referring to ... the flute fetish band geek that made me her bitch and then ditched me after prom .
yes , that's great experience .
that's the one .
ah , you just gotta find the right girl , jimbo .
brings it all together .
i had the right woman .
she just sells her cottage and takes off to parts unknown .
oh , my romantic life has past its peak .
take me out to the pasture and shoot me .
super start to a super summer , fellas .
welcome home .
guys , i got it .
pack your bags .
for what?
we're moving to the lake .
we're gonna be the shit .
everybody on the beach is gonna know us .
plenty of opportunities to practice for nadia .
throw a huge party at the end of the summer to cap it all off .
dude , that's a great idea .
that way we'll be able to welcome heather back ... and we'll be able to prepare for nadia's big arrival .
this is it .
this is my summer of love .
just thought i'd say good bye to you animals .
hey , mr. levenstein .
how are you , sir?
hey .
all packed up i see .
yeah , we're all set , dad .
don't worry , okay?
i'll be fine .
come on and give your old man a hug .
keep it real , homies .
you too , sir .
have a good summer .
all right , let's go .
i've been running these numbers here and i don't think the four of us can afford this place .
not on summer jobs .
well , i kind of thought of that .
so ...
i invited someone else .
oh , yeah !
the stifmeister's coming back to grand harbor !
deck the halls !
bye bye , great falls !
wipe my ass and lick my balls !
it's stifler time , baby !
whoo hoo hoo !
whoo hoo hoo !
stifler , if you're gonna be living with us you gotta behave yourself .
all right , you and finch just stay out of each other's way .
kevin , stifler's stench is unavoidable .
finch , fist yourself .
that's right , baby .
we're here .
yeah , baby , we're here !
whoo hoo hoo !
'cause we like having fun at other people's expenses
cutting people down is just a minor offense
it's none of your concern how you shall never learn
i'm sick of being told to wait my turn
i don't wanna waste my time
become another casualty of society
i'll never fall in line
become another victim of conformity
it's a palace .
it's a temple .
isn't this great?
ah , dude .
are you kidding me?
this just won't do .
i'll do everything
but you're not that way
i'm lost around you
and you'll do everything with the same old lies
when i can't even try
yeah , you get me high i'm feeling so low
how far will you let me go
yeah , you get me high i'm feeling so low
i'm knocked down by the vertigo
guys .
check this out .
this is it .
i fall behind you
i'll make the same mistakes with the same old lies
will you idiots tell me what this fucker's doin '?
don't touch me while i'm tantric .
tantric "?
what the fuck is tantric?
it's a buddhist discipline .
you learn to channel your body's energies your chakras .
when you can do that , you can have sex for hours , even days .
and this stuff's for real?
it's been around for centuries .
with tantra you can make an entire session of sex ... feel like one giant orgasm .
eventually , you can sustain that feeling by meditating .
well , maybe you can teach me sometime?
very doubtful .
true .
come on , jim .
you can't possibly be that bad .
oh , no?
no way .
well , i guess there's only one person that really knows for sure , huh?
oh , yeah?
where's she this summer?
hey , are you here for the mid session performance?
guests go in the amphitheater .
you can't be here .
do you know where i could find michelle flaherty?
guests bring food .
food attracts animals .
this one time , a bear came , and then the bear had to be destroyed , which means they shot it in the head with a rifle and killed it and it died .
you must know michelle .
one , two , three , four .
one , two , three , four .
one , two , three , four .
that's a lot of flutes .

michelle , um ,
i left you like , uh like three messages after prom .

we plop a keg on the deck , and the girls come in off the beach .
it's like a hummingbird feeder .
you think so?
i know so .
guaranteed hotties .
fellas , nice pad .
good view , but ... the sherminator sensors detect no female life forms in the vicinity .
high likelihood of a sausagefest in progress .
the girls are comin '.
i made some calls .
yeah .
the sherminator's got a point , kev .
since when do you start listening to the sherminator?
since he made me realize there's an abundance of wiener here .
i mean , look around , dude .
dude?
all right , now it's your turn .
oh , come on .
there's nothing to tell .
hey , what's up?
what are you guys talking about?

how 'bout you?
oh , you know , there was a few girls three .
ooh , look at you .
you stud .

now that kevin told us , what about you?
you haven't had the slightest bit of attraction to any girl at school?

whoa .
the sherminator detects serious heat at a distance of two meters .
prepare to deploy beer .
sherman , dude ,
let me give you a valuable piece of advice , okay?
drop the whole " sherminator " thing .
please repeat previous statement .
look , i know your last name is sherman , right?
and that rhymes with the terminator which was a big hit movie ten years ago .
but you can't tell me a gir" s ever really gone for it .
system overload .
hasta la vista , jessica .
what a freak .
vic , hey , you guys are leaving?
you know , we barely had a chance to hang out , you know , catch up .
well , what are you doing this weekend?
i can get together .
cool .
let's hang out .
all right .
bye , kev .
see ya , jess .
no , no , that's all wrong .
thank you .
have a nice day .
good bye .
so what does he mean , " meet up "?
you know , like hang out , grab lunch , whatever .
i told you , we're just friends now .
and he totally understands .
oh , yeah , i'm sure he understands quite well .
he does .
oh , no , sir .
these are all wrong for you .
i mean , seriously .
sure .
well , we're friends .
but it's not like i see her making plans with anyone else .
right .
i don't see her with a boyfriend .
i think that puts me on deck .
hey , vicky only slept with one guy since we went out .
i mean , that like makes me 50% of her entire guy related life .
you dipshit .
she didn't sleep with one guy .
she slept with at least three .
what?
when a girl tells you how many guys she slept with , multiply it by three and that's the real number .
didn't you fuckers learn anything at college?
look , he did not sleep with three girls , okay?
much like sly and the family stone aren't gonna dance on in here ... and gang bang me between the afros and the bell bottoms , okay?
it's not gonna happen .
kevin meyers did not sleep with three girls at michigan .
but why would he lie to me?
it's not a lie .
it's an adjustment .
the rule of three .
but why would he lie to me?
it's not a lie .
it's an adjustment .
the rule of three .
the rule of what?
three .
a guy tells you how many girls he's hooked up with , it's not even close to that .
take that number and divide it by three .
then you get the real total .
so , if kevin's saying it's been three girls , it's more like one , or none .
none?
rule of three .
it's an exact science , consistent as gravity .
ozzy , i'm happy for you .
at least you've seen a nice bod while heather's off sucking dick .
sifler , keep your fantasies to yourself .
dude , use your fuckin 'brain .
oh , i'm an american college chick .
la , la , la .
your european cultural shit is so charming .
ooh , hey .
hot spanish guy .
love your accent .
love your ding dong .
i'm telling you , man , right now there is a dick in your girlfriend's mouth .
knock it off .
what'd i say?
oh , my god !
guys !
check it out .
lesbians .
lesbians live here .
you know , mr. homophobic wizard , that it is possible for women to hold hands and not be gay .
friends can hold hands .
hey , finch , i don't wanna hear about you and your boyfriends .
go jerk off .
unnecessary .
tantra teaches you to hold an orgasm over time ... in anticipation of an ultimate moment ... to release it upon the world .
i'm filling up to the brim .
that's fucking disgusting !
oh , i'm gonna throw up .
hello?
hey , heather .
you're in !
oz !
how's the studying going?
i'd hardly call it studying .
i've been going to the picasso museum , hanging out at sagrada familia , going with pierre to the parc guell .
hey , who's pierre?
one of the guys in the program .
he's got a girlfriend back in france , so we've kind of got something in common .
ah , that sounds cool .
yeah , i've overheard them on the phone at night .
and , uh , well , it made me think .
hey , oz , i'm reaching under my shirt , and i'm rubbing myself .
oh ho ho ho !
oz , come on .
it's phone sex .
help me out here .
okay .
uh
i'm going over to my bed .
yeah .
and i'm lying down .
and i'm slowly ... reaching downstairs .
grab it .
tell me how big it is .
listen , heather , i'm feeling kind of awkward .
oz .
if we can't physically be with each other , then we have to learn to be more vocal .
right?
right .
okay .
okay , here we go .
i'm reaching in my pants now .
and i'm rubbing it for you , heather .
and it feels so good .
yeah , me too .
oh , yeah .
i got
call waiting .
oh , shit .
hello?
wrong number .
hey .
hello .
wrong number .
all right , look , man .
i got my hand on my dick right now , okay , and i'm trying to have sex with my girlfriend over the phone .
emir , good for you , man .
okay .
hey .
sorry about that .
where were we?
i think you were reaching for something .
oh , yeah .
oh , yeah , heather .
i'm rubbing it and it feels so good .
hey , oz , i'm touching myself .
what else do you want me to do?
oh , heather , baby .
why don't you tell me my dick is as big as stifler's .
stifler , get off !
i am getting off just listening to the two of you .
keep going .
i think we should try this another time .
yeah , all right .

okay , jim , this is what i'm talking about .
your main problem is ... you're so uptight .

this summer's turnin 'out to be great .
mucilage is , um , dangerous territory .
and i would think any adhesive product ... would have a warning right on the on the tube .
i thought it was , uh , uh , lubricant .
okay , i was trying to use lubricant .
oh .
oh .
son , couldn't you have left that disgusting thing at home?
excuse me?
well , that kind of material is offensive to me .
oh , well , we're sorry .
but you see , my son couldn't leave it at home ... because he's having a bit of a medical emergency .
that's right .
thanks , dad .
your opinion of his taste in video rentals , i'm afraid , is , uh , not a priority , lady .
dad okay?
it's at the bottom of the totem pole .
okay?
thank you , dad .
okay .
my son ... is sitting here right now ... with his hand glued to his penis .

i'd tell your son to keep his pants on during that party .
oh , yes , yes .

this has been a good news day , son .
here .
put this on .
little chilly out there .
well , here we are .

i don't know how i get myself into these things .
but thanks for understanding .
you've been really cool .
i mean , between this and , you know
you know , you may be jimbo or jumbo ... or jimbodinny to these guys in here , but i want you to know there are two people ... who still remember where james emanuel levenstein came from .

so long
for someone almost just like you
but with attitude i've waited
so come on

come around , now can you see
i want you in a vinyl suit
i want you bad
bad , bad oh , no .
oh , my god .
you still broken?
oh , my god .
you still broken?
no .
i'm fine .
i might have to ... actually go through with this .
jim , what's the big deal with nadia , anyway?
i mean , okay , so she's 50, 000 times hotter ... than most girls , but ... come on , it's just sex .
oh , no .
you saw the thing on the internet .
did it look like i might have had ... a slight interest in nadia then?
add another year to that .
okay .
hey , why don't you bring nadia to the concert first?
it'll be a cool date .
we'll see how things go .
michelle , you have been great .
thank you .
anytime .
come on .
you ready to break up?
you big , stupid dummy !
theater is so cool !
i don't care if you are the best lay i've ever had in my life .
i hate your guts anyway .
don't say that .
and i don't care if you did give me ten orgasms in a row , because you smell really bad .
no !
i smell really bad !
because we've been having so much sex , and and i haven't showered , and i wanna shower !
so , don't you go being all super sexy guy anymore , because i am now impervious ... to your unrelenting machismo and sexual ardor .
and that includes fucking me in the ass !
so there !
we had something special .
what's up?
what's up , dog?
vicky .
hey .
hey .
i'm so glad you came .
you want something to drink or hey .
can i help you?
kevin .
that's my date .
what?
you you saved them all .
how sweet .
you don't think i'm a dork?
whatever you are , jim , it is what i like .
kevin left .
didn't look good .
kevin left?
just wandered down the beach .
you okay , kev?
wanna tell us what's up?
wanna feel finch's ass?
no , i i went to say hi to vicky , and she was there with a date .
you hooked up with three girls this year .
you're doing fine .
rule of three , oz .
i guess i was living in the past wanting to party with you guys ... and be with vicky , it's just like high school .
you remember that day after prom?
you know , we made a toast to the next step .
i guess i never took it .
my brother said that by the end of the summer i'd see the big picture .
and i see it .
no matter what , times change and things are different .
the problem is , i don't want them to be .
you know , kevin , i haven't moved on either .
i've been obsessed with the one woman i can't have a real future with , other than a very kinky , extremely warped one .
i gotta find a new goddess .
it's gonna take patience , but i've been celibate all summer .
yeah , you kinda get used to it , though , huh?
are you insane?
hey , look , kev , different does not necessarily mean worse .
as a matter of fact , i think things are just getting better .
or am i gonna have to drag your ass back to that party and prove it to you?
i'll walk .
wow !
you know , you have beautiful eyes .
oh , you're sweet .
that's a really nice top .
oh .
thanks .
you're welcome .
wanna fuck?
are you serious?
come on , baby .
give it to the stifmeister .
i think you better  your loss .
wow .
you know , you have beautiful eyes .
come here , dude .
come on .
you're making an ass out of yourself .
you're ruining my mojo .
and you're not the stifmeister , okay?
it takes years to develop true stifmeister style .
come on , man !
i just wanna see some boobs .
hey , pop tart .
dream on , midget .
excuse him .
come here .
take this .
you're on cop watch .
go out in the driveway .
see any cops , call me , okay?
steve all right .
gentlemen , uh , this appears to be a party .
guys , if you'll excuse me , i'm gonna go look for nadia .
good luck .
ahh .
so what was this year like for you?
did you miss high school?
well , no .
when you travel as much as i do , you get used to moving on .
but i have great memories .
wow , can we go in there?
the lighthouse?
yeah .
yes .
yes , we can .
how romantic .
jim , come on .
wow !
wow !
oh , it's beautiful !
cool !
jim , i have told you my memories from high school .
what are yours?
oh , uh
well , uh , you .
you have not changed .
jim , relax .
we are just , how do you say , tooting our horns .
actually , that is quite difficult .
how do you mean?
well , this one time at band camp ,
i
holy shit .
what?
tell me .
uh , well , uh , this one time at band camp ,
i got stuck playing this trombone .
and i can't play anything at all .
so i totally sucked .
and everyone thought i was this petey guy , but i didn't know what to think , so i just kept playing and playing , and i didn't know what i was doing .
it was so funny !
i gotta go .
what?
why?
nadia , please don't take this the wrong way , but , but you're you're everything that i used to want .
and as much as i may really , really regret what i'm about to do , there's somebody else i want to be with .
you you want the band geek?
nadia , i am a band geek .
i just never joined the band .
you go get your geek .
someday i will find mine .
well , my mind is now playin'tricks on me
and the world is crashin '
i think about it
hey , um , kevin meyers .
hi .
sorry i was a dick before .
it's okay , man .
my name's brett .
uh , could you give us a sec?
sure .
look , you don't have to do this .
maybe i was being selfish ... in wanting to be your friend .
maybe it's just not gonna work .

jeanine .
jeanine .
call me stifler's mom .
oh , stifler's mom !
oh , stifler's mom !
i don't want to be an ass anymore
sick and tired of all the promises
that i made to you
and i pray to you
and i know you think you've heard it all before
something tells me that you think i'm stupid
when i say to you
that what i say is true
too much lyin 'too little tryin '
this time it's gonna be the last time
i say the last time again
this time is gonna be the last time
what i say the last time again
i don't want to be redundant anymore
skipping like a broken record you can play again
but i'll do it all again
i'll put it behind me then you rewind me
this time is gonna be the last time
what i say the last time again
this time is gonna be the last time
what i say the last time again
once again i must have been
tryin'to wash away the sin
'cause i wake up bathroom floor
i won't do this anymore
starting tomorrow
this time is gonna be the last time
what i say the last time again
this time is gonna be the last time
what i say the last time again
this time is gonna be the last time
what i say the last time again
this time is gonna be the last time
what i say the last time again
and it's always little things
that to the surface brings
space you need to breathe
before the curtain call
the light that leads the way
before you hit the wall
the mountain that you climb
just to take a fall
the blind among the blind and i say
there's an echo 'round my heart
draggin'me down
beneath the waves in silence i fall
there's a halo above my head
spinnin'me 'round
'cause i don't know if i'm alive or dead
there's a dagger in my hand
bleeding me dry
and all we have to lose
is time
and what we lose we leave behind
stay around and we will shine
