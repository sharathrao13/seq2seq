so i'm gonna get a three to one return on my money?
otto is the real deal .
i met him at a hash bar in amsterdam .
he speaks russian , german , arabic ...
mr. ostroff's trust is not gained easily .
two years it took me .
you see , micky , he doesn't like new faces .
so tell me , why am i looking at a new face?
otto krieg , meet my friend , bobby .
he's helping me with the finance .
he's not a cop .
let's see the money .
you like it?
yeah , i like it .
we have deal?
we have deal .
bring 'em down !
move !
move in !
this is the fbl !
put your hands on your head !
what is this?
you brought a cop , and he brought his fucking friends !
don't look at me .
this is not good .
my father will kill me !
you're under arrest for the importation and sale of contraband firearms .
scheisse !
gun !
drop the gun !
drop the gun !
whoa , whoa , whoa !
otto !
this is not my deal .
this is not my deal !
i don't even know these guys !
cease fire !
holy shit .
holy shit .
bobby !
bobby !
stay down !
i'm calling it .
it's 1 : 37 am .
bag him and ship him .
god , i hate this job .
give me a hand , fellas .
yeah .
all right , frank .
we gotta get you outta here .
what the hell happened?
who's the kid?
definitely not in the plan .
but we beat the spread .
this isn't football .
it's a figure of speech .
people weren't supposed to die out there .
get them ided and get them to the morgue .
and get me my pants !
can we get some pants over here?
ah , shit .
surprise !
to frank castle ... the finest soldier , the finest undercover op , the finest man i've ever known .
what am i gonna do without you?
get a girlfriend .
have fun in puerto rico , man .
say hello to your folks .
thanks .
agent weeks .
he's robert saint .
howard saint's son .
more paperwork for tampa pd .
no , we can handle this .
see you , buddy !
see you , fellas !
bail him now .
bring him to the club .
don't hit me .
don't hit me .
hey , micky .
don't hit me .
you sell homegrown pot by the ounce , micky , not by the barrel .
you sell badly forged , fake passports to haitians .
so what inspired you to become ... the mr. universe of international arms dealers?
you should apologize for the death of mr. saint's youngest child .
okay , i know how it looks ...
but bobby , he buys pot from me .
and when he found out what i was doing , he insisted on coming in .
he put up half the cash .
he came of his own free will .
if you're gonna kill me , will you leave my face alone , for my mother?
we just made your bail .
if i wanted to kill you , i would have left you in jail where we have friends , and in some way that i can only describe as deeply pornographic , you would have been killed .
but you're a small piece of shit , and i don't want the karma of your death on my soul .
but on the other hand , maybe i don't believe in karma ,
so guys ...
no , i'll tell you what i want to know .
i want to know one thing only , who brokered the deal?
his name is otto krieg .
and if it's any comfort to mr. saint , he's dead too .
well , it's not .
it's actually no comfort at all .
but what might be comforting to me , is to watch the slow death of the man who was supposed to be taking care of my son , and making sure that he did not get into trouble .
now , micky ... what would your father think of this?
your father gave his life for me .
what would he say?
i didn't know it was gonna happen like this .
please !
well , ignorance is no excuse .
the man who is responsible for my son's death must die .
i told you to never let him out of your sight .
mr. saint , bobby told me to stay .
tell him , john .
john !
mr. saint !
it was bobby's idea !
he wanted to go alone !
he thought he could impress you .
thank you for that explanation .
my son didn't need to impress me .
more boxes , guys .
this was a hard one .
this was the last one .
it's over .
tell that to your son .
he doesn't believe me .
where is he?
you know .
you know what i miss most about buck?
he could catch a ball , no matter how hard you threw it .
he was right there .
why are we always moving?
this is the last time .
you said that last time .
i did?
yeah .
you said we were leaving california and we were gonna move to virginia , and you'd work in washington ... and we'd never move again .
i guess i've said a lot of things , huh?
so why london?
london's a safe place where we can all be together .
no more more moving around , i promise .
some day when you're older , will ...
i'll tell you why we had to move so much .
he was such a special boy .
are you identifying this body as your son , robert saint?
he deserved better .
somebody lied to him .
promised him one thing , gave him another .
do you know that i used to have to dress him till he was 13?
i'd tie his ties , and comb his hair ...
i'll have to get him a new suit .
who is otto krieg?
who are the people who work for him?
who are his friends?
who would stand to make money from this deal?
tell me .
we can't talk about the case , mr. saint .
now , i understand your grief , but for your own safety ,
leave this to professionals .
professionals .
yes ...
i'll do that .
i'll do that .
good bye , son .
we called new york , we called las vegas , we called europe and hong kong , we even got the sicilians in it for old time's sake .
with what you're paying howard , we'll know everything about otto krieg within 24 hours .
high five .
come on .
that was cool !
leave it .
we'll be back .
race you?
yeah .
got anything left?
i don't see it !
come on !
he did his free ascent on the first try .
i've seen navy seals do worse .
that's what we like to hear .
i'm so proud of you .
good job , babe .
hey , frank , is that that candelaria?
yeah , manuel .
people around here call him a witch doctor .
he lives on that island way off the point .
only one damn fool i know crazy enough to swim over there .
gee , let me guess .
this is the first family reunion we've had in five years .
and that's too long .
that's too long .
amen .
my grandson !
i just want to say that ...
i'm very happy that you're all here .
i'm very proud that you're all here .
and that ...
i love you .
love you , too , dad .
salud !
salud !
hey !
hey .
what happened?
what's wrong?
you know ...
i can't believe i'm home ...
and that i could ever be so lucky .
because there were times , maria , i gotta tell you ...
frank ...
i lost so much time , with both of you .
and i'm really sorry ...
stop .
hey , hey , hey .
i married you .
i knew what i was doing ... and i'd do it again .
you and i , we're not lucky , we are blessed .
i'll see you at home , son .
his name's frank castle .
senior agent .
just got the bureau's london desk .
his alias , connections , apartments in europe , none of it was real , not even his death .
well , maybe it was .
maybe ... he died and came back to life so he could die again .
you have your chance .
he's leaving for england next week and he's at a family reunion in puerto rico .
i think you should be there so you can come back and tell livia how he died .
all right .
wait .
his family .
his whole family .
is this what you want?
morning .
hey .
we should have another .
i'm ready .
another what?
good morning , will .

i love it .

they used to be pretty good ,
but now they're nail drivers .
let's see .

all these feelings
from my intuition ...
when did you speak to him?
about an hour ago , mr. saint .
try the grand turk .
i got something for you .
harry winston .
beautiful .
without you , they're just diamonds .
i asked you to avenge our son and you did .
thank you .
vaya con dios , castle .
go with god .
god's going to sit this one out .
la donna mobile qual piuma al vento !
you are insignificant .
you are a coward .
you are a great disappointment to your mother and i !
yes !
die !
die !
die !
i'm the most amazing man in the world !
it's really loud .
is it supposed to be that loud?
oh , it's beautiful .
he hasn't slept all week .
how do you know?
'cause i haven't slept all week .
what do you think he does?
maybe he's an artist .
wow !
our neighbor is an artist .
you are the expert on artistes?
i've known a few .
so what do you think he's doing?
ask him .
oh , yeah , right .
ask him .
i'm late for work .
bye , joan .
bye , joan .
bye .
this is undignified .
you're supposed to be dead .
let's talk .
stay away from me , castle .
i have friends , you know?
let's talk about your friends .
make you own friends , buddy .
i'm not saying nothing .
i talk to you , they'll kill me .
you don't help me , i'll kill you now , mick .
the saints tell me nothing .
nothing?
they pay your rent ... your legal bills ...
you should know something .
what's the torch for?
2, 000 degrees , mick .
enough to turn steel into butter .
it won't hurt at first .
it's too hot , you see?
the flame sears the nerve endings shut , killing them .
you'll go into shock ... and all you'll feel is ... cold .
isn't science fun , micky?
i don't know shit .
you'll smell burning meat , and then ... then it'll hurt .
i swear i'm telling the truth !
son of a bitch !
oh , my god .
should we call the police?
let's stay out of it .
he's a very scary man .
he's killing someone and we're next .
exactly .
wait , wait !
smell that , mick?
i'm burning off some of your fat .
i'll tell you anything , anything , anything you want to know .
that's a good boy .
okay , okay .
any discussion of howard saint's business involves two cubans ... the toro brothers .
they control all the prostitution and gambling up and down the gulf coast ... tons of cash .
they give their dirty money to howard saint , who transports it in cigarette boats to his banks in gran cayman , washes it and wires it back clean as a whistle .
for the love of god !
you are not a nice person .
so what's up , you're gonna string up howard saint and blowtorch him?
i like that idea ... but i have something better .
guess what?
you're gonna help me .
unless you want to stay howard saint's lackey for the rest of you life .
i hate the saints .
all of them .
tell me about them .
what they do , where .
when .
howard saint's a man of strict habits .
he has first tee time five days a week at tampa springs .
never fails .
he likes money , he likes power , but the thing this guy covets most , the wife , livia .
what happened to your family ...
howard did that for her .
she's just like him , and she's just as predictable .
every thursday , she works out , gets her nails done and goes to the movies .
howard knows every move this broad makes .
any man who looks at her wrong , he ends up in tampa bay .
let's not forget johnny boy , the son you didn't kill .
what a putz .
last but no least ,
quentin glass .
been with howard 20 years ... the family consigliore , lawyer , cpa and a sadist .
who knows what's going on with this guy?
yes?
pop , you are not going to believe this .
no , i think i might .
chief morris , will the budget cuts mean less officers on the street?
thank you .
thank you .
what impact will all this have on police layoffs?
castle?
frank castle?
hey , i thought you were dead .
wait , hold them .
where have you been?
it's been five months since my family was killed , and i don't see one man in jail .
obviously you're upset .
upset?
is that the word?
i used to get upset when i had a flat tire .
i used to get upset when a plane was delayed .
i used to get upset when the yankees won the series .
so if that's what " upset " means , then how do i feel now?
if you know the word , tell me , because ...
i don't .
taxi !
enrique , qu pas?
get up .
wheel the money out .
fill that up .
you know whose money this is?
you know whose building this is?
howard saint's .
he's going to fuck your life up .
he already fucked my life up .
now , out the window .
what?
out the window .
good business , murder?
did saint pay for each one , or does he get a group rate discount?
our top story this morning , a double homicide in downtown tampa .
two men were gunned down in the lobby of the saint building ...
frank castle is alive and back in tampa .
you may remember , castle's the fbi agent presumed dead ...
he speaks six languages , he did two tours and 12 special ops ctu .
what's ctu?
counter terrorism unit .
at this hour , tampa police do not have a motive and no arrests have been made .
that's the latest news at this hour ...
it's him .
hi , there .
i just want to say that i'm very happy that you're all here , very proud that you're all here .
i guess i've said a lot of things .
we're not lucky , we are blessed .
maria !
how is he still alive?
i don't know , quentin .
i wasn't there .
why is he still alive?
that's an interesting question .
maybe he's still alive because he was meant to suffer more .
i don't know .
but how can we make him suffer if we can't find him?
he's daring us .
no , no , he misses his family and he wants to die .
he's asking for help , so let's help him .
did the toros call?
they'll be here tomorrow morning .
you invited them to this house?
they invited themselves , howard .
mike , joe .
welcome .
let's get a drink .
we don't have time for that , howard .
oh my god , this weather .
yeah , just a little polluted , don't you think so?
i've seen hurricanes .
i've seen it rain like cats and dogs .
but never in all my years have i seen it rain hundred dollar bills .
yeah , this rainmaker , castle , he was supposed to be dead , no?
yeah .
guys , look ... come on ... been working together for 10 years .
first time anything like this ever happened .
at a personal loss to us of $50 million , howard .
that's one time too many .
do you want us to find another banker?
no .
okay .
look , we want our money back , all right?
and we want protection on the next shipment .
do you guarantee our money this time?
with everything i've got .
in 48 hours , castle is a memory .
a pro from memphis .
the best .
come on , joannie .
open up the goddamn door , you fucking bitch !
i want to talk with you now honey , you're hurting my feelings .
joannie , open up the goddamn door !
you're hurting my feelings , you bitch !
hmm , dude?
it's kind of late .
yeah?
what time is it in hawaii?
you should leave right now .
shut your face , you lard ass .
joannie , come on , baby , let me in .
i'm gonna call the cops .
are you?
you'll call the cops?
you'll call the cops?
call them !
call them !
call them !
call them !
call them !
call them !
hey !
get out .
what , what , what?
he don't have his tricks anymore?
and the speed?
huh?
what , what , what ...
you shouldn't play with knives .
no one's ever stood up for me before .
come on , champ .
let's get some ice on that .
come on .
frank kicked his ass , huh?
he's fine , he's all right .
i ...
i've lived in seven cities in seven years and ... in each one , i've managed to find the one guy who will treat me the worst .
but i'm trying to fix that .
you're castle .
used to be .
we saw you on tv .
i don't have one .
i'm joan .
dave's the one with all the ... the metal .
and bumpo's is the ... well , you can probably figure out which one bumpo is .
we are really sorry .
about what?
about your family .
did you know them?
no .
i'm over it .
don't let your memories kill you .
they won't kill me .
glass .
quentin glass?
who is this?
i have certain photographic studies of you and your boyfriend .
meet me at the bar , at the wyndham hotel .
bring $5, 000 , and i'll give you the photos .
you wouldn't want howard saint to see them , mr. glass .
thank you , sir .
have a good night .
quentin is late .
do you know were he is?
i have no idea .
have you seen your mother?
it's thursday , pop .
right .
movies .
mr. saint?
i know where mr. glass is .
i saw him pulling into the wyndham hotel a couple of hours ago .
howard?
come here .
i was just telling quentin about the movie .
where have you been , quentin?
i've been looking for you .
i dozed off out by the pool .
that's funny .
what's funny?
micky said that he saw you at the wyndham .
micky should have his eyes checked .
so he's mistaken?
yes , howard , he's mistaken .
oh , my goodness .
these pancakes are really good , joan .
what's he been doing for the last few days?
drinking .
a lot .
good morning , sir .
sit anywhere you like .
i can hear what you're thinking
all your doubts and fears
and if you look in my eye
in time , you'll find the reason i'm here ^^and in time , all things shall pass away
in time , you may come back some day
to live once more
or die once more
but in time , your time will be no more .
do i know you?
i know you .
you're that boy in the newspaper , came back from the dead .
i didn't catch your name .
you like that song?
i wrote that for you .
i'm gonna sing it at your funeral .
you are one dumb son of a bitch .
bring a knife to a gunfight .
ms rpido , ms rpido !
come on , let's move .
let's move !
all of it?
ail?
look at this , joe .
this is what i'm talking about .
don't touch me , cojones .
don't tell the toros , till we have a plan .
look at this place .
isn't it beautiful?
howard , we had chicken a la havana tonight .
very tasty .
don't touch the cubans .
have you heard the news?
a shipment of cash was torched at malaqui .
whose money was it , huh?
our mother always put her cash in the mattress , which i thought it was a good idea till the house burned down .
it was a big fire .
she lost everything .
that's what happens when you don't watch your money .
you lose everything , howard .
everything .
14 shipments are perfect .
one went bad and i get this , why?
because you want to scare me?
there's no insurance in this business .
you know that .
so i'm not covering you fucking losses .
i've got more guns than you do .
it's not even cuban , howard .
it's honduran .
they're animals .
with all due respect , we don't have more guns .
it's my duty to ...
it's your duty to make castle dead !
i don't care what it takes , what it costs .
call the russian .
hi .
mr. castle , we need you help right now , because the guy who's after joan is in her apartment ... right now .
we want you to have dinner with us .
i know it's not thanksgiving , but um ...
i'd like us to all say what we're thankful for .
i'll start .
i'm thankful to be alive this year .
and to have a job .
and to be sober .
yeah , i'm thankful for my mom ... getting out of jail .
you know , it's cool .
and this girl gave me her number ... which is also cool .
thanks for leftovers .
i'm full .
thanks for diet pepsi .
and thanks for good neighbors .
thanks for dinner .
there's dessert .
ice florentine .
you have to try my ice florentine .
come on , dave .
come on .
i need your help .
no , no .
i'll do that .
i know what it's like .
i know what it's like to try and make your memories go away .
you can make new memories .
good ones .
good memories can save your life .
i'm not what you're looking for .
la donna mobile
qual piuma al vento
muta d'accento
e di pensiero
sempre un'amabile
leggiadro ...
e sempre misero
chi a lei s'affida
chi le confida
mal cauto il core
pur mai non sentesi
felice appieno
chi su quel seno
non liba amore
la donna mobil
qual piuma al vento
muta d'accento ...
did you feel that?

do you have quentin's house keys?
sure .
i do his laundry .
micky?
get me last month's phone bill .
yes , sir .
need help with some underpants , sir?
go fuck yourself .
evening , quentin .
howard .
what are you doing here?
jim bowie .
excuse me?
you know , jim bowie , the colonel ... the man who died in the alamo ... had a knife named after him .
he was a gambler .
and when he was accused of cheating at cards , what he would do is take the guy in the other room , move the furniture like so ... then he'd take his knife , he'd throw it in the ground ... and the one that left ... got the money .
gee , i didn't know that , howard .
the only problem is that you have too much furniture .
i'm not following this .
i'm accusing you .
of what?
cheating .
i've never taken a cent from you .
where were the two of you going to do it next time , the wyndham?
two who?
you and the whore .
i don't know what you are talking about .
oooh .
you're good .
you should have been a stage actor .
maybe next lifetime .
what are you doing?
you better pick up the knife , quentin .
if you don't , i will .
i don't need to grab a knife , howard .
this isn't funny , howard .
whoa !
what?
what? !
how long have you worked for me?
you think i'm an idiot?
have you lost your mind ...
you were my brother .
i gave you everything , didn't i?
but it wasn't enough .
my liv .
what has she told you?
don't you see?
don't ... don't do this !
don't , don't , don't do this .
howard ... you're killing me .
you're killing me .
why?
why are you killing me?
why are you killing me?
what the hell are you doing?
i know about you and quentin .
quentin?
you went to the movies last thursday , 8 : 00?
yes .
then at 9 : 00 , you called him from your car?
must've been a short movie .
howard , there's an explanation .
i know , i know .
you're fucking him .
you're fucking my best friend .
that would be a little hard to accomplish , howard .
oh , so true .
so true .
howard .
you should really learn to pay your parking tickets .
what ...
you thought we ...
howard ...
quentin was gay .
you'd say anything !
i don't know what happened .
would you just talk to me? !
howard , howard .
howard .
you have to listen to me .
please , howard .
please , howard .
do you recognize the neighborhood?
little cuba .
just think , the first time i saw you was only three blocks from here .
look at me , howard .
of course then , the neighborhood was much more colorful .
look at me .
howard , please .
please , howard .
now it's just for whores .
you'll fit right in .
look at that rock !
look at it !
take a look !
i gave you that when i had nothing .
all i asked for in return , was loyalty .
i have been loyal to you , howard .
you're not making any sense !
i'm not making sense?
here , look at this .
i found that in quentin's bed .
does that make enough sense for you?
huh , huh?
no .
me neither .
i'd like to go to the club .
i need a martini .
$50, 000 a piece .
and $50, 000 more to the man who kills him .
if you accept this money , you are in till it's over .
where have you been?
huh?
where's quentin?
oh ... well , he's wrapped up in something .
i called home , no one was there .
your mother's gone .
what?
she took the train .
frank castle is dead .
he died with his family .
in certain extreme situations , the law is inadequate .
in order to shame its inadequacy , it is necessary to act outside the law , to pursue ... natural justice .
this is not vengeance .
revenge is not a valid motive , it's an emotional response .
no , not vengeance ... punishment .
hey , eddie , more champagne on the double .
coming right up .
stop !
you look like a strong kid .
you must work out .
ever try isometrics?
this antipersonnel mine weighs eight pounds .
not much .
well ... try holding it with an outstretched arm .
hell of a workout .
don't leave me like this .
don't leave me like this !
help , please .
howard saint .
howard saint !
you took everything from me .
you killed my son .
both of them .
i made you kill your best friend .
i made you kill your wife .
oh , god .
and now i've killed you .
you're right , good memories can save your life .
when dave gets out of the hospital , check the cupboard .
i left something .
for all of you .
you're leaving?
i have work to do .
read your newspaper every day .
you'll understand .
which section?
obituaries .
those who do evil to others ... the killers , the rapists , psychos , sadists ... you will come to know me well .
frank castle is dead .
call me ...
the punisher .
one , two , three , go !

i've thrown away , i've thrown away again
the pills that make me
i've thrown away , i've thrown away again
the chance to want to change
i've thrown away , i've thrown away again
standing all alone
i've thrown away , i've thrown away again
eyes wired shut
running through my brain
pulling back the skin , it happens , we're getting older
eyes wired shut
running through my brain
it's all the same , but in the end
it keeps me coming
i've blown away , blown away again
the fear of failing
i've blown away , blown away again
the lies that make me sane
i've blown away the chance to make it right
i want to be , i want to see
i want to make it back to me
eyes wired shut
running through my brain
pulling back the skin , it happens , we're getting older
eyes wired shut
running through my brain
it's all the same , but in the end
it keeps me coming
eyes wired shut
running through my brain
pulling back the skin , it happens , we're getting older
eyes wired shut
running through my brain
it's all the same , but in the end
it keeps me coming .
i wanted you to know
that i love the way you laugh
i want to hold you high
and steal your pain away
i keep your photograph
and i know it serves me well
i want to hold you high
and steal your pain
because i'm broken
when i'm ionesome
and i don't feel right
when you're gone away
you've gone away
you don't feel me here
anymore
the worst is over now
and we can breathe again
i want to hold you high
steal my pain away
there's so much left to learn
and no one left to fight
i want to hold you high
and steal your pain
'cause i'm broken
when i'm open
and i don't feel
like i am strong enough ...
