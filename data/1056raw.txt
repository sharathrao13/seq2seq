we're sitting there , you know , and she's got her bare ... feet up on the couch , and i notice that her second toe is , iike , half an inch ionger than her big toe .
that's it?
you're breaking up over that?
hey , i don't need that circus shit .

i'm starting to think we're jinxed here .

no , i'm not mad .
i just ...
go on , say it .
you know what?
no matter what it is , we're gonna work it out .
hal , i'm not attracted to you .
so what?
you think everyone who goes out is attracted to each other?
get real .
they're attracted to each other in the beginning .
oh , come on .
that sounds iike a bunch of new age hooey .
maybe for some people there's a iittle spark in the beginning , but for most , the attraction part happens way iater .
whoa !
what?
that's it?
just iike that , we're breaking up?
weil , we were never going out .
we just had one date .
come on .
hey , iet's stay together five days .
that's aii i need .
why do you need five days?
tomorrow i'm finaily getting my promotion .
there's gonna be parties , dinners , this , that .
i need you now .
hal , you're gonna be so busy , you won't even think about me .
how am i not gonna think about you?
you iive right across the hail .
i don't know , hal .
maybe ... maybe you should think about moving .
hal , we've made a decision regarding that wholesaler position .
yes !
it's about time , dave .
we decided to go with the gai from merriil .
she's a proven entity .
a big producer .
i'm sorry , man .
no , it's ...
the gal's a proven entity .
what the heck you gonna do?
hal , i'm so sorry .
yeah , thanks .
you should have gotten it .
you deserved it .
no , i didn't .
i didn't put them in a position where they had to promote me or iose me .
it's a good iesson .
make yourself indispensable , that's the key .
and to make matters worse , jiii dumped me iast night .
dumped you?
don't you have to be going out to get dumped?
what does that mean?
weil , i just thought it was more of a ...
anyway , why do you care so much?
jiii wasn't right for you and you know it .
how can you say that?
she was perfect .
when are you gonna get it?
they're just weil formed molecules .
and by the way , her tits weren't even real .
weil , i could squeeze 'em .
that's reai enough for me .
hal , i don't understand how a guy who's as nice and ioyai and generous as you could have such a huge flaw .
what are you talking about?
it never occurred to you that picking girls on their iooks may not be the best way?
am i supposed to apologise for having high standards?
high standards?
in the five years i've known you , every woman
i should say giri you've gone after has been completely out of your ieague .
what's that supposed to mean?
she doesn't mean anything by it .
she's just saying you're not that good iooking .
oh !
i thought she was implying something reaily mean .
no .
hey , it's you .
you're the tv guru guy .
yes , tony robbins .
pleased to meet you .
yeah !
oh , man !
so , wow !
you gave advice to what chama caii it .
president clinton?
mandela?
no , no , no .
gorbachev?
no , no .
pamela anderson .
right?
yeah !
give me another handshake .
wow !
man , iook at those mitts !
it's iike grabbing a bunch of bananas .
and those dogs .
how big are those?
size 16 , buddy .
holy cannoli .
so you must do pretty good with the iadies .
just one .
reaily?
yeah .
she sounds hot !
she is an amazing iady .
i bet .
so , what are you doin 'in my town?
we're doing a seminar here .
i help people to deai with the chailenges in iife with more dignity and courage .
that's my deal , is the courage .
i try to ...
hang on a second .
buddy , hang on .
the elevator just stopped .
that's weird .
man , yeah .
so what do we ...?
hang on .
are you ok?
i'm fine .
you ok?
yeah , yeah .
it's just i feei a iittle iight headed .
then she dumped me .
flat out .
without even the courtesy of a severance pop .
a severance pop?
you know , one iast ...
to ease the pain .
the nice ones'ii sometimes throw you that .
it sounds iike you've had some odd relationships .
yeah .
see , the problem is i'm kinda picky .
what do you mean , " picky "?
weil , for instance , i iike 'em reai young .
like , did you ever see paulina in her first sports illustrated iayout?
you're iooking for a young paulina type?
that face , but with better headlights .
you know how hers have kind of dimmed iately?
heidi klum's beams would do .
and her teeth .
or that britney spears girl .
she's got great knockers .
but she's a tad muscular .
actuaily , you know what?
her ass would do , too , if she had a better griile .
like micheile pfeiffer back when she did grease 2 .
but she'd have to be a iittle smilier than micheile .
like rebecca romijn stamos , before she got stamosed .
but not as skinny .
someone meatier , iike heidi , but without the accent .
you know those accents : yah yah yah yah .
they reaily get old fast .
you know what i'm saying .
someone iike that .
don't you think you're being a iittle bit shailow in the way you iook at women?
weil , no .
i mean , you know , i'd iike her to be into culture and shit , too .
ok , hypotheticai situation .
which do you prefer , a girlfriend missing one breast or half a brain?
ooh , toughie .
that's a toughie .
how's the remaining breast?
is it big?
how's your relationship with your parents?
exceilent .
i mean , my mom's hilarious .
she golfs every afternoon .
actuaily , i don't reaily remember my dad .
he died when i was nine , so ...
if you were nine , you should remember a iot .
yeah , but i don't .
my mom thinks i might have been a iittle traumatised by the whole thing .
anyway , aii i remember is , he was great .
he was a great guy , and i reaily loved him , but ...
i'm sorry you iost him .
hey , iisten , i know you got a great heart .
you're just fixated on the outside appearances of people .
hai larson , i'm gonna do you a great favour .
reaily?
this is how it'ii work .
from this moment on , whenever you meet someone in the future , you're only gonna see what's inside them .
so you'ii respond to that , because that , my friend , is where the true beauty iies .
ok , tony , i think you're getting a iittle cabin fever .
hold on .
what if i told you by doing this , you could have the most beautifui women in the world and they'd want you?
is this iike what you do in your seminars?
no , no , this is very special .
this is just between you and me .
let's get up and i'ii show you what to do .
now , you got a pattern of iooking at women and judging them by the exterior .
we gotta break that pattern .
so has there been a time when you were especiaily shailow with a woman , where you thought you were better?
aii the time .
aii the time .
is there one specific time where you were reaily shailow?
oh , yeah , i got one .
think about that .
devils , come out !
what the heii are you doin ', banana hands?
just hang on .
we gotta jolt your nervous system .
oh , yeah .
i'm sorry .
it's not just talking about it .
here's what i want you to do .
just relax for a moment .
i won't do that again .
i didn't mean the " banana hands " thing .
close your eyes .
just relax .
and i want you to imagine that you're on a beach .
it's a warm day and the sun is just starting to set .
and you're iooking in the eyes of a woman , and you're feeling her heart .
you're seeing her soul .
you're feeling her spirit .
that's it .
that's it .
exceilent .
exceilent .
taxi !
oh .

yeah .
and then check this out he does this thing to me where he makes it so i can score better with the iadies .
at the time i thought it was a joke .
but this afternoon , the first beautifui woman i saw went for me .
could be coincidence .
yeah , but no .
this was different .
it was iike she went crazy for me or something .
i think maybe talking to him helped my confidence , cos i do feei more confident .

she's funny , she's smart , she teaches self esteem to sick kids ...
i would never believe a giri as beautifui could have such a great personality .
ugly duckling syndrome .
what?
she probably wasn't pretty tiii high school .
the personality developed out of necessity .
you know what?
i bet you're right .
she's way too pretty to be so nice .
sometimes they're ugly so iong , when they turn pretty , they don't realise it .
the ugly self image is so weii ingrained .
that's a reai find .
hey !
hey !

i thought we were having a good time .
we were .
it's just , you know , hal , i'm not used to aii this .
used to what?
hal , you've been reaily nice to me today .
i reaily appreciate it , but ...
what , your other boyfriends aren't nice to you?
i don't have other boyfriends .
builshit .
weil , i had one boyfriend .
it was kind of recently , actuaily , but it didn't work out .
you've been burnt , huh?
no .
that's just it .
i , um ...
i've never been close enough to anybody to get burnt .
please !
with a mug iike that?
you must be fighting 'em off daily .
right i mean , i saw the way your friend mauricio iooked at me .
i thought he was gonna shoot me with a tranquiiliser gun and tag my ear .
don't worry .
he's been acting reaily weird iately , especiaily around reaily pretty girls .
hal ... do me a favour and stop saying that i'm pretty and that i'm not fat , ok?
cos it makes me uncomfortable .
ok .
you have a problem with compliments?
look ...
i know what i am and i know what i'm not .
i'm the giri who gets reaily good grades and is not afraid to be funny .
and i'm the giri who has a iot of friends who are boys , and no boyfriends .
i'm not beautiful , ok?
and i never wiii be .
and i'm fine with that .
you know?
but when you go around saying that i'm something that i'm not , it's just ... it's not nice .
whoa , rosemary .
you're starting to scare me .
i mean , i reaily iike you , but i have to assume you're a iittle nutty if you reaily believe you're not beautiful .
grow up , hal .
rosie .
wait a second .
weil , it was too good to be true .
hm?
rosemary .
turned out to be a totai psycho .
her self image is so far off , it's scary .
weil , maybe you had a iittle something to do with that .
what are you talking about?
aii i ever did was teii her how perfect she was .
reaily?
yeah .
then she got aii huffy and told me to grow up .
weil , that's probably good advice .
you are kind of immature .
you're not serious .
you actuaily think you're more mature than me?
you're right .
i'm probably more immature than you , but at ieast i have a bigger wiilie .
yeah , bigger than a mouse's .
what the heii was that?
i said your wiilie's ...
i heard what you said , but it took you , iike , eight seconds .
you can't come back with a comeback after eight seconds .
you got three .
five , tops .
that's why they caii it a quip .
not a " slowp " .
aii right , you got anything better to read?
i gotta fire off a missile .
hi .
is this a bad time , or ...?
no .
i just wanted to apologise for iast night .
you don't have to apologise .
yeah , i do .
i cailed you , iike , immature or sophomoric or something iike that .
i know you're not ... oh , my god , hal !
you gotta get in here and iook at this turd !
it iooks just iike klinger from m* a* s* h.
why don't we get outta here?
ok .
coffee?
excuse me .
are you ready to order?
yes .
two double cheeseburgers with bacon , one with relish .
thank you .
ow .
are you ok?
brain freeze .
* baby , now that i've found you i can't let you go
* i'll build my world around you
* i need you so , baby , even though ...
excuse me , sweetie .
professional .
hey , biily , stay over near the iadder .
weak .
so weak .
you wanna see a splash?
i'm gonna show you a splash .
ready?
* spent a lifetime looking for somebody
* to give me love like you
* baby , now that i've found you i can't let you go ...
that was good?
bialy?
bialy?
bialy?
biily !
daddy !
sorry .
what's the matter?
i should have changed at the beach .
what?
are you crazy?
you iook great .
i don't normaily dress iike this around my parents .
hey , hey , come on .
i'm the one who should be nervous here , not you .
hey , you know , i've been meaning to ask you .
were you adopted?
no .
why?
cos your dad has that weird accent .
and i've seen him around the office .
i gotta say , i don't see the slightest resemblance .
reaily?
everybody says if you put a wig on him , he'd iook just iike me .
look at who's here now .
come here , my darlin '.
hi , daddy .
rosie , honey .
mom .
good to see ya .
this is hai larson , the guy i was teiling you about .
great to meet you , sir .
likewise .
nice to meet you , hal .
the pleasure is mine , mrs shanahan .
wow .
i can see where rosemary gets her figure .
what the heil ...
what the heii is that you've got on?
we were at the beach .
won't you be putting something else on , darlin '?
oh , come on .
she doesn't have to do that for me .
let's just keep it casual .
casual .
hey , dad , hal's one of your great untapped resources down at the company .
why don't you teii him some of your ideas?
oh , so you've got a few ideas , do ya?
it is risky , but the rewards are greater , too .
only a company with a solid reputation iike jps could ever market this product .
hal , iet me take your plate .
thank you .
it was delicious .
can i get you boys some coffee?
i'd love a cup of tea , darlin '.
maybe just a drop of the hard stuff .
yeah , i'ii just have a cup of joe .
that'd be great .
thanks .
i have to say , hal , i'm impressed with a iot of your ideas .
some of them are dog shit , but for the most part you seem to have done your homework .
so i'd iike you to do something for me .
ok .
i'm meeting with me executive committee monday morning , and i'd iike you to make a presentation .
seriously?
weil , nothing fancy , you understand .
just talk about the same things that you talked about here tonight .
great .
i'd love to .
oh , and by the way , you can cut out the act now .
excuse me?
you think i got as far as i did in me iife by bein 'a fool?
now , you've got ambition , hal , and i admire that .
heil , i wish i had a hundred more iike yourself .
we'd be the number one firm in the country .
and me daughter would get a heii of a iot more dates .
i'm sure rosemary doesn't have any problem getting dates .
i told you to cut the shit out , aii right?
look , rosemary's me daughter , and god knows i love her dearly .
but i think we both know that we won't soon be seeing her twirlin 'the baton , marching along with the dailas cheerleaders .
uh ...
i don't understand .
i'm teiling the truth , hal .
and the truth is i haven't been able to bounce me daughter on me knee since she was two .
you know , i've read about people iike you .
people iike me?
super achievers with impossible standards .
nothing's ever good enough .
nothing ever measures up .
it never occurs to you that your kids are people , with their own feelings .
you think they're an extension of you , iike your company , or your $20 miilion learjet and your picasso out in the front hail .
everything reflects on you , so nothing and no one is ever good enough .
go on .
when i first met rosemary , she told me she knew she wasn't that good iooking .
i could not believe my ears .
i thought how can a person this beautifui possibly interpret what she sees in the mirror to be anything other than that?
weil , now i know .
is everything ok?
yeah , everything is fine .
just fine .
what?
nothin '.
i just can't believe how iucky i am .
you swear to god you're not gonna iaugh?
come on , i'm not gonna iaugh .
oh .
daddy iike .
* the look on your face
* it could never explain your heart
* and the touch of my lips
* it could never tell you my thoughts
* and you want me to change
* i can't get used to ...
what in the ...?
how did ...?
get over here , houdini .
* cos it's not really me
* this is my world , this is who i am
