dance is like love .
just move your feet to the beat of your heart .
go , yes !
come on , follow your inner beat !
come on , ladies .
move your feet to the beat of your heart .
i told you you could do it .
ladies , i have an announcement .
i'm sad to say that today will be my last day here ... at shanti dance and modern movement .
what?
no .
next week , my classes will be taken over by sister munju murthi , a nun from kerala .
but why?
where are you going?
to america .
you're going to drive a cab there?
a cab?
no way .
i'm going to be a star .
you can do that?
well , of course you can .
anything's possible in america .
look at my friend , vijay rao .
the one with the red mercedes?
and the penthouse?
he went there with nothing .
no job , no money , no visa ... and he's a big success .
i don't want to dance with a nun .
'bye , ramu .
'bye .
take care .
'bye .
we'll miss you .
i wanted a spring wedding .
i was going to bake a mango cake .
you'll end up working in some restaurant .
with bad food .
soon you'll be back , begging me for a decent life .
maybe you're right .
maybe i'm better off staying here ...
and becoming a salaried man .
don't even say that .
but i tell my students , " move your feet to the beat of your heart .
and my heart is telling me to go to america .
i dreamt of it my whole life .
don't worry .
i'll be fine .
you'll not only be fine .
you'll be famous .
like ricky martin .
mira , be careful !
your bike !
hey , man , can i get your autograph?
so your flight was good?
yeah , it was good .
and your sister .
how's your sister?
okay .
is the mercedes in the shop or something?
or something .
this is the penthouse .
it's the top floor .
it's the only floor .
you're a real bastard , you know that?
come on , yaar .
if i told you the truth , you never woulve come .
immigration !

oh , shit .

and an idiot !
bhen ki lohdi !

shut the fuck up !
i know it's been a while , but ...
the penthouse is beautiful .
vijay's doing really well .
no , new york is great .
cook says your samosas are getting cold .
that was the butler .
my samosas are getting cold .
i better go , nanima .
namaste .
the guy's totally lame .
how long can that guy go for the " working late " crap?
what is this?
i ordered the chicken tikka masala .
that is chicken tikka masala , sir .
that is not chicken tikka masala , sir .
that is definitely chicken tikka masala .
dude , i know chicken fucking tikka masala , and that's not it .
so how about taking your skinny brown ass back to the kitchen and get me some?
yes , sir .
i'm sorry , dude .
oh , my god .
no chance .
i even told him you got 10 kids and your wife's in a wheelchair .
i don't care .
i don't want that stupid job back .
come on , man .
you got a roof over your head ... and food in your belly .
what more do you want?
i want what you promised me in your letters .
so did you , vij .
the penthouse , the mercedes .
so what happened to your business empire?
huh?
it's not that easy .
i don't want it to be easy .
i just want my chance .
maybe i'm not good enough .
maybe all i can do is be a waiter , but i want my chance to find out .
isn't that the american dream?
you're a fool .
do you know why they call it the american dream?
because it only happens when you're asleep .
next !
i'm here for the audition .
ramu gupta .
tell me something i don't know .
my mother comes from hyderabad .
my father wanted to marry a muslim girl , but his family wouldn't let him .
everybody's a comedian .
what'd you say your name was?
ram chandra gupta .
actor .
dancer .
okay , rammy , what would you say your specialty is?
well , i move smooth .
i take instruction easily .
i'm not afraid to try new things .
good .
we like that .
how big are you hard?
yes , i work very hard .
no .
your johnson .
how big is your johnson?
johnson?
your wand .
your pork sword .
your baloney pony .
would you like to see my macarena?
is that what you call it in your part of the world?
let me see your macarena .
hey , macarena !
all right , you wanna lose the pants?
is that part of the movie?
could be .
i get it .
like tom cruise in risky business?
all right !
you know you could be big .
oh , yes , sir , very big .
i can see that .
i must say , most guys come in here , they wax the dolphin .
that's it .
it's over .
you dance .
i like that .
thank you .
plus you got this really interesting look .
it's kind of an oriental cabana boy thing .
you're unique , rammy .
you could be a big star .
yes , sir .
i know .
i'm telling you .
i'm the star , like john travolta .
pulp fiction " travolta or " urban cowboy " travolta?
grease " travolta .
how many lines do you have?
i haven't seen the script yet .
i know your lines , just like your lines in the restaurant .
would you like chutney with your chapatis or poppadums with your paneer?
" do you want nachos with your big gulp?
piss off , man .
oh , i'm sorry .
good for you , yaar .
come on , so tell us about it .
what role are you playing?
man in turban working in gas station .
you guys joke all you want , but this is a real movie and i am the star .
clock's ticking .
come on .
okey dokey pokey .
actors on the set .
walk away .
okay?
grab that .
for a starring role , i don't have a lot of lines .
what are you doing?
giving mr. happy a shine .
he gets more screen time than your face does .
what?
any sign of our mr. rammy?
okay , now , no time for nerves .
you gotta get out there .
don't you want to be in the movie?
but a real movie , not ... pornography .
sugar , please .
everybody has to start somewhere .
so it's one , two , and the inserts and we're done .
there's my jane .
now where's my tarzan?
hey , there's the ram .
everyone meet rammy .
meet your co star sharrona .
hello .
all right , let's rock .
come on .
welcome to fantasy island .
okay , rammy , you live on this desert island , obviously .
and you've basically been in the bushes beating your meat your whole life .
one day you're skipping along the beach , you see this ... hot power suited mama , and you just wanna ...
teach her your native tongue .
hindi .
you're the junior senator from wisconsin .
you're investigating a nuclear dump site that's contaminating the marine life .
okay , roll camera .
we are rolling .
action !
hello , i'm senator snatch .
i'm here on official government business .
are the natives here friendly?
the natives here are restless , senator .
you look hot in that power suit .
i didn't realise the tropics would be so warm .
the temperature isn't the only thing here that's up .
cut !
just tape it up .
it'll be fine .
brilliant .
nice moment , rammy , but we're not doing this for lifetime .
okay?
you see her , you screw her , we go home .
also , you're happy skipping along the beach .
life is good .
skip .
screw .
happy .
got it .
guess who's coming at dinner , take two .
hello , i'm senator snatch .
i'm here on a ...
rough stuff .
problem?
we don't have wood .
stand by .
holding on wood .
standing by for wood .
we are holding on wood !
do you have an erection problem?
no , sir .
ask the makeup girl .
she's a guy .
i'm more woman than you'll ever have , pencil dick .
sorry , dude .
get hard or get going .
it's just sex , silly .
where'd you find this guy?
he found me .
you know , we coulve had waldo .
no , waldo's too hairy for this .
the natives don't have a lot of back hair .
it's just the idea of being naked in front of all these people .
well , the trick is not to be naked up here .
it's like other actors get costumes , but we don't , or at least not for very long .
so your naked body is really just your costume .
i promise , in india i'm a real stud .
if you and i could just go somewhere by ourselves ... without people watching .
there's always someone watching .
dwain?
god , silly .
god is watching us?
yeah , but not for kicks .
i mean , the universe isn't run by some big old perv .
what do you mean?
i mean , the same god who made the rose and the ocean ... he made me .
and my body is made to have sex ... just like the rosebud is made to open .
wow .
we're in .
places , please .
short five .
sorry .
the most powerful sexual organ god gave us is our brain .
think about it .
action !
okey dokey pokey .
cut !
what now?
i can't stop thinking about god .
and therefore i cannot achieve wood .
i see .
sharrona , you gotta help me out here , please?
forget it , dwain .
if i'm late again meeting rusty ...
he's gonna get suspicious .
doesn't this guy ever go to a video store?
hey , that's good .
this'd be a great character for you .
we haven't done a schoolteacher number in a while .
not since ...
the prime of miss jean's booty .
see you .
please .
taxi !
taxi !
broadway and 86th .
i'm in a hurry .
sharrona !
guys , you seen miss lynell around?
who?
i'm telling you , bro , she's definitely two timing you with the librarian .
why don't we go to o'neill's?
we drown out your sorrows .
hey .
hey .
thanks , guys .
i'll catch you in the a . m . , randy .
not if i catch you first , firebug .
where you been , princess?
one of the foreign students had a problem straightening out his grammar .
'bye , guys .
not a very friendly group .
they're never nice to substitutes .
nice to see you , mr. and mrs. de borman .
service entrance is downstairs .
okay .
good evening , lloyd .
lars , your sister's locked herself in the bathroom again .
please , get her now .
so , swami , you really see the future?
a couple more of these and i do .
as many of you know , our birthday girl ... is on a little quest for spirituality .
om .
om .
lex?
one more " om " and then you have to come to your party .
it always has to be what she wants , even on my birthday .
i wanted a tibetan gathering with a rinpoche ... but no , she does an indian feast with a ... ... world famous swami .
all those people care about is sex and money .
if they have money , they care about sex .
if they have sex , they care about money .
if they have both , they feel guilty and raise money for the opera .
more tandoori in the library .
swami , you're on .
alexandra searched for so many years .
in the shoe department at bergdorf's .
she has searched for the perfect diet , the perfect rock star boyfriend .
it seems lexi will search for anything except steady employment .
so , dear lexi , in honour of your current fixation ...
i give you swami bu .
swami bu has gone to another dimension .
i swear she was 16 .
mrs. von austerberg is going to kill me !
she paid a lot of money for a swami , and now we have no swami .
we have jack shit !
or we don't have jack shit .
i don't know which one it is !
what we do have is a drunk bastard .
you ...
didn't i fire you?
rasphal , i was just wondering about my job .
you really want your job back?
mr. ramu " tom cruise " gupta?
swami bu !
swami bu !
i'm conjuring up a swami .
here he is .
ladies and gentlemen , swami bu .
not long ago ... a wise man told me that all people care about is sex and money ... and opera .
now , myself , i don't have any money ... well , because i'm a swami , and ... swamis don't like opera , because ... well , you can't dance to it .
so i will talk to you about sex .
what'd you pay for this?
god , is it hot in here .
god .
god wants us to have sex .
and if god wants us to have sex , then , well , it can't be bad ... because the universe isn't run by a big old perv .
glad he cleared that up .
your naked body ... is like a costume that you wear to be yourself .
be comfortable ... in your nakedness .
the most powerful sexual organ god gave you ... is your brain .
think about it .
are you thinking?
my whole body is about to think .
and like roses are made to open , so must you .
you must open your rosebud .
dance is like love .
join me .
follow your inner beat .
is he doing the macarena?
looks like it .
wait , isn't that the ...
i think it's one of those dervish , spiritual , trance dance things .
excellent .
come on .
i thought we were just going to do some light chanting .
bravo .
the macarena , man .
shut up .
swami bu !
we're going clubbing .
you want to come?
unless it's against your religion or something .
no , my religion believes in clubbing .
swami bu .
call me ramu .
candles .
we need candles .
you can't have spiritual sex without candles .
you must use a lot of candles in india .
when the electricity goes out .
undress me slowly , spiritually ...
like a goddess .
pretend i'm vishnu .
vishnu is a man .
kali?
kali is the goddess of death and destruction .
okay .
death and destruction .
music .
we need music .
not really , no .
this is perfect .
it's the guatemalan boys choir .
they're deaf .
i'm having sex with a guru .
chakh le .
it's so powerful .
i can stand alone .
it feels like we're doing it .
right now .
from there , it's like ...
it feels like we're doing it .
right now , from there , it's like you're pulsating through me .
it's better from here .
trust me .
oh , guru , what is the most sacred position?
you may find this hard to believe , but in india guru sex is very fast .
what about the slow chanting 200 position sex?
that's tibet .
where i come from , we do it very fast .
like wild monkeys at sundown .
and if we don't , the evil spirits might grab our tails ... and throw us into the next jungle .
you know what?
don't get me started .
how you gonna teach kids values if you haven't lived them yourself?
will you hate me if i make you wait?
no , i love you .
i'm proud to save myself for you .
you know what?
you're the best .
honey , can i ask you a question?
how does a nice , catholic schoolgirl like you ...
learn how to make all those sexy little sounds?
well , me and my friends used to practice kissing .
on our hands .
that's silly .
the second half is starting .
remember when i had that thing with my african drumming teacher?
i don't know .
he just got really needy .
but this one is the real thing .
not a lot of people know about him yet .
it's up to me to get his message out there .
anyway , he's gonna be bigger than deepak chopra .
ramu is the guru of sex .
the guru of sex .
she really thinks you can be as famous as deepak chopra?
who is he?
does he dance?
no , he tells americans how to get rich and be happy .
i thought they knew .
have you even tried the kama sutra?
no , have you?
a little .
by myself .
but , vijay , i don't want to be a guru .
i want to be an actor .
then act like a guru .
it's better than acting like a waiter .
so , who writes the lines for deepak chopra?
they're not lines .
he has a philosophy and shit .
these guru types don't just put on turbans and screw chicks .
they say profound things they've been thinking about for centuries .
the point is the guy's made a gazillion dollars .
a gazillion dollars?
what's that in rupees?
i don't think they have that many .
sex guru .
why didn't i think of that?
i want the suede , not the leather .
i want every colour .
no , i'm staying in town , so have them sent to new york .
okay .
i gotta go .
guru ramu .
thank you for gracing me with your presence .
champagne?
i hope you don't mind .
i invited amy to join us .
she's a journalist .
a journalist?
no .
so , as the son of the maharajah , when did you have your epiphany?
when i was 15 .
tell us everything .
i'll touch yours , you touch mine .
no big deal .
do you know who or what you were in any of your previous incarnations?
dessert?
that's me .
i was hoping to schedule a scrub .
it seems like you're holding back , just a little .
what you said at my party was so much more powerful .
god , rosebud , the naked costume , and all that .
right .
you know , lexi , maybe i'm not the one to do all this .
wow .
alexandra , hi .
how's your mother?
remarkably lifelike .
guru ramu , kitty .
guru?
does he do privates?
does he ever .
tuesday?
perfect .
heaven .
ciao .
you do privates , right?
you'll get a call back .
adios , waldo .
great job today .
thanks .
hi .
it's me .
rammy .
hello .
i just wanted to apologise for what happened on the set .
i got paid .
excuse me , sir .
watch it , pal .
i'm so sorry .
i'm so sorry .
pardon me .
excuse me , ma'am .
hello , again .
so now you're stalking me?
no , i was hoping perhaps i could buy you a cup of tea?
i don't do that .
perhaps coffee then .
look , rammy , i'm engaged to a nice , normal guy .
do you know how hard it is to find a nice , normal guy in the city?
right?
i just want your help with a professional problem .
would you stop worrying about it?
a lot of guys can't get it up .
you don't understand .
people are telling me i could be the next deepak chopra .
well , i'm not familiar with deep pack .
i don't watch dirty movies because my fiance's kinda religious .
no , i have an opportunity to make a lot of money .
duh !
why do you think i got into this business , 'cause it was interesting?
in three years i saved enough to buy a house in throg's neck ... and pay for my whole wedding .
mulberry street .
do you want to see the cake?
grazie , ciao .
hi , i'm sherri , i called earlier .
are you tony?
yeah , i got everything over there .
that's ...
expensive .
it's $800 .
you see this one?
this is more in your price range .
that's very nice , too .
yeah .
actually , sir , we will order this one .
i want my lovely bride to be happy .
rammy , no .
now , you two kids discuss it amongst yourselves , okay?
rammy , $800 is too much .
i can't accept that .
look , it's not a gift .
i want you to be my teacher and i'm happy to pay for this privilege .
okay .
yeah , come on in .
if this is a bad time i could come back later .
what am i doing here?
isn't this your apartment?
what?
yes , this is my apartment .
i mean , what am i doing letting you into my apartment?
the other day ...
rusty , my boyfriend ... doesn't know about my x rated job in the real world .
he thinks that i'm a pg 13 girl .
that i'm a nice , normal girl .
well , you are .
what?
a nice , normal girl .
you think so?
wait a second .
do not flirt with me .
do not .
that is rule number one .
okay?
and no little gifts either .
you don't try to hit on me or take advantage of any situation ... that you might find a turn on .
do you understand?
this is just a lesson .
i am a teacher and you are the student .
of course .
so , no touchy feely .
if you touchy feely me , i will hurt you .
i will cause you pain .
i know the art of karate .
okay .
if we're gonna do this , you have to promise me ... that everything i say stays in this room .
you can't tell anyone .
not a single soul .
no , you see , you don't understand ...
then you can leave right now .
but of course .
okay .
let's get started .
so the other day , what happened?
why did you lose it?
i was afraid .
there were 20 people around , many drinking coffee , watching me .
exactly .
fear .
fear is cold .
it freezes us up .
fear of performance .
fear of doing something bad , something dirty .
what would our parents think?
what do we think?
do you know where we hold our fears?
up here .
further south .
that's why sex is such a release .
when we come , we let go of our fears .
and when we let go of our fears , we touch our soul .
so the way i look at it is ... my pussy is the door to my soul .
why are you afraid , kitty?
well , what makes you think i'm afraid?
i feel it .
please , close your eyes .
we have so many fears .
fear of performance .
fear of doing something bad .
fear of what people will think .
yes .
do you know where we hold our fears?
between our eyebrows where we get those yucky little lines?
in our genitals .
that is why sex is such a release .
when we come , we let go of our fears ... and when you let go of your fears , you touch your soul .
your pussy is the door to your soul .
so , if i touch myself here ...
kitty?
... i won't be afraid?
excuse me .
how much do i owe you?
what you wish .
i'm sorry .
i need to be by myself .
lexi , he is beyond insightful .
i have to go .
thank you .
you're welcome .
nice to meet you .
wow .
she paid me .
you're incredible .
kitty's such an unhappy person and you helped her so much .
just think , there are so many unhappy people out there .
i know most of them .
but we can help them together .
i really want to do that .
i've never ... really done anything , you know .
can we do that?
can we ... help mankind?
i really want to help mankind .
cool .
vljay : $2, 000 !
it's bloody incredible .
but it's not my wisdom , it's sharrona's .
she thinks she gives me lessons to be in porno movies ... and she made me promise not to tell anyone .
great .
vij , be serious .
i am , yaar .
get her wisdom and use it .
don't you want to be a star?
well , yes ...
how do you think that's going to happen if you're not a guru?
name one indian star in america .
name one .
that guy from the simpsons .
he's a cartoon .
don't you guys have to be at the restaurant?
ramu's got a new job .
you gonna be a cab driver?
no , i'm going to be a guru .
cheers , guruji .
vij !
come on , you want to get comfortable in your naked costume , don't you?
you need to be comfortable with your own body .
okey dokey pokey .
great .
your nakedness .
say that five times .
i'm a good lover .
and again .
i'm a good lover .
i deserve pleasure .
the maharaj of beer .
next .
you two are gonna have a wonderful weekend .
i'm a good lover .
thank you .
that was very good .
that was very good .
stop .
guru , my brother golfs with the maharajah of jaipur , bubbles .
and he says he's never heard of you .
well , it's a big country .
gurus shun the life of wealth and materialism .
swami muktananda said everything in the universe ... is made of divine consciousness ... and its innermost form dwells in the centre of us all .
wow , that's good .
lexi , can i see you in the kitchen?
do you know where it is?
so , guru ... what would you tell a couple that has hit a wall?
are you all right?
can i get you a doctor?
what in heaven's name are you doing?
being happy for a change .
freely expressing my sexuality .
you are sucking face with your yoga instructor .
he's not my yoga instructor .
and so what if i am?
darling ... we don't date the help .
remember what happened with aunt eujanie and that u. p. s. man?
news flash , mother , all people of colour aren't here to serve you .
how dare you say that !
i have served meals to the homeless .
good meals .
things i'd eat myself , if i still ate carbs .
at any rate , you are making our guests feel very uncomfortable .
they'll get over it .
you're drinking too much .
darling , come join .
hi .
yes .
thank you very much .
can you feel it in your mouth?
can you taste it?
the taste is sweet .
the taste is ...
mint chocolate chip .
okay , you can open your eyes now .
i got that from an acting class .
it helps when you don't click with someone .
remember that we have five senses ... and using them can make anything sexy .
so , why do you do these movies?
if you're having doubts about the business then you should quit now .
trust me .
you like to cook .
in india , we call that a homely girl .
you know , a girl who likes to do things in the home .
yeah , that's me , homely girl .
can i taste?
cinnamon?
hey , that's lamb stew .
yeah , so?
it has no flavour .
come on ... taste .
are you flirting with me?
no .
no .
got you .
don't take everything so seriously .
all right , that's it for today .
okay .
and , rammy ...
i use mint chocolate chip , too .
edwin , is that you?
what's wrong?
you haven't been up here since the reagan administration .
it's bush time .
and tell josh that a lot of agents want to sign him .
lexi .
we met at dr. sis retreat for neurotic compulsives .
i'm not supposed to say that .
lexi who wouldn't go to the oscars with him .
don't say that .
just tell him lexi , okay?
he'll know who i am .
ciao .
get up , we have the trainer at 10 : 00 a . m .
10 : 00 a . m .?
i have to go .
i have an appointment .
but i planned my day around you .
i was going to buy you sweaters .
i'm sorry , lexi , but i have my own life , too .
you can't do this to me .
you can't just go and not tell me where .
guru !
i have abandonment issues !
okay , now i'm going to tell you something i've never told anyone ... but it's helped me more than anything .
i can't even believe i'm telling you this .
you don't have to tell me if you don't want .
no , i want to .
okay , one of the biggest problems ... is making something mechanical look romantic .
so music can help .
i love music .
me , too .
what i do is , i hear and i feel the music ... in my body .
what music?
songs , romantic songs .
like , i let it sing ... and then the rest of me follows .
i'll show you .
name a song .
la bamba .
that doesn't work .
it has to be romantic .
it has to send love through your loins .
don't go changing to try and please me
you never let me down before
did you see what i was doing?
yeah .
it's like , on certain words the passion comes through my body .
it's like i can actually feel billy joel between my legs .
not billy joel the person ... but the romance , the sweetness , the intention of his words .
now you try it .
don't go changing to try and please me
don't try to make a point , try to touch your soul .
i'll do it with you .
you never let me down before
i don't imagine you're too familiar
why don't you get on top of me?
it's the only way you'll learn .
what?
sorry .
don't go trying some new fashion
don't change the colour of your hair
i don't want clever conversation
i never want to work that hard
i just want someone
i can talk to
i want you just the way you are

i've never had sex without 20 people .

excuse me , i have to get my clothes and go .
no one leaves till we wrap .
what's up?
" ramew gouda .
hey , you made it .
i'm so psyched for this .
josh , ramu .
it's nice to meet you .
may i take your coat?
no , i'm fine .
oh , no , please , i'll just hang it ...
i was at a past life workshop .
really?
did you see me?
i worked in the mailroom .
just kidding .
why don't you have a seat?
lexi tells me you have quite the following .
i'm just gonna jump right in , okay?
the goal here is to separate you from all the other self help spiritual types ... so you're not just another indian , or , excuse me , native american .
what you've got going for you is god .
and by the way , god is big .
you mention god , people pay attention .
god demands attention , and ...
what can i say?
we want to be in bed with god .
but what do people want to pay attention to more than anything else?
sex .
you let people think about both , which is brilliant .
josh is one of the smartest agents in town .
we can handle your book deals in london , website in munich ...
your television in new york .
television?
that's right .
movie deals in hollywood .
hollywood?
sure .
step one , you gotta expand your core audience .
how do we do that?
i think we do a big show , a couple thousand people .
maybe we book a broadway house .
broadway?
the guru of sex . " one night only .
you gotta keep them wanting more .
hey , ari , get me the playhouse .
and , by the way , i'm not into micromanaging ... but you're not going to wear that ...
what is it you're wearing , anyway?
i really like josh .
what's going on?
what do you mean?
you run to secret appointments ...
to past life workshops with costumes .
i'm sorry ...
you don't invite me , when you know how much i love that stuff .
i couldn't , i ...
you'll be the mother teresa of sex .
i want to help you , and you leave me out .
i don't understand that .
no one can give you what you want .
it's too much .
what are you saying?
i'm saying live your own life , not mine .
follow your own dreams , not mine .
there are many different paths .
you can go this way , or that way .
but you must choose your own path .
it's your own damn journey .
i'm going to meditate on that !
yeah .
hello .
thank you .
'bye .
ramu .
what more could a swami ask for?
hey !
hey .
hey .
i got an idea for today's lesson , but ...
no .
it's such a beautiful day .
let's take a walk .
okay .
after you .
so , i miss my nanima the most .
does your family like it you're in america?
no , they'd rather i be married off with kids ... holding down a nine to five salary .
but they're getting used to it .
they want me to be happy .
you're lucky , 'cause the only family i have right now is dwain and peaches .
they're quite a family .
no , really , they saved my life .
i don't even want to tell you what i was doing before i met them .
they treat me right .
i'm safe with them .
look , sharrona ...
i have to tell you something .
go on .
this is really difficult .
let me tell you something first .
i really like teaching you .
it makes me feel good to help someone .
but i don't think you should do it .
you don't know what it's like .
it's porn ...
i just don't think you should do it .
you're so pure and good and ...
you don't know what it's really like .
that's why i made up all those ways to get through it .
because i wanted to make it seem like i was doing something else .
something important and respectable .
you are respectable .
how can you say that?
rusty doesn't even know what i do .
if he did , he wouldn't marry me .
but i'd marry you ... ... for 50 cows .
only 50?
well , they're sacred you know .
okay , 100 sacred cows , and ...
a herd full of blue elephants .
blue?
blue .
i have to go .
no , you don't have to do anything .
of course i do , silly .
see you .
but , hey , that's randy for you .
he's so funny .
you always say that .
to sherri and rusty .
russell tells me you'll help teach the catechism class .
catechism .
neat .
it's a blessing to have a professional in charge at last .
hi , baby .
father feels you're an amateur .
leave mum alone .
i said no such thing .
tuesdays is knitting circle , and you will be the first member of the millennium .
i had to use all my influence .
if it doesn't interfere with couples 'bowling , right , honey?
you ever bowl with rusty?
it's a good thing .
throws the ball like a ballet dancer .
don't start , dad .
tell me , my dear , have we not met before?
sweetie , have you met father flanagan before?
no , father , i would have remembered meeting you .
your lovely face looks so familiar to me .
you don't believe me?
watch and learn , tough guy .
you're the chick from star whores , right?
episode 69?
excuse me?
no , that's not me .
no , it's you .
i saw that forwards and backwards .
you're out of line .
sit down .
you're making a mistake .
it's her .
baby .
what's he doing?
you know what?
i'm sick of this .
there must be some cheap porn star out there that looks just like sherri .
i'm sorry , honey .
i'm feeling a bit sick ...
sweetheart , wait ...
i have to go home .
honey?
what did i say?
pre wedding jitters .
hello , is rammy there?
ramu?
no .
can you tell me where he is?
the broadway playhouse .
thank you .
now that you have an agent , i think you need a manager .
what do managers do?
take 15 percent .
guru ramu and friend .
hey , lex .
well , hello .
vijay rao , manager .
guru , i've been meditating on what you said ... and i think i understand why you pulled back from our relationship .
i don't .
the reason you ignited my kundalini energy in the first place ... was so i could move that sex force into other chakras ... my heart , my mind , maybe even some day , my third eye .
exactly .
yes , i knew it .
i knew giving up the stuff would help me focus .
what stuff?
everything .
i'm moving to a studio apartment in queens .
will you be subleasing your penthouse?
that's right .
feel it .
yes , let it sing .
feel billy joel between your legs .
and then , feel your genitals come alive .
some want to sing in harmony .
that is okay .
and i don't see you anymore
don't go trying some new fashion
don't change the colour of your hair
that's right .
send that love through your loins .
feel it .
that's it .
unspoken passion
genitals are the gateway to your soul .
let them sing .
although i might not seem to care
let go of your fears .
fear is cold .
i don't want clever
cold freezes .
when we make love ...
conversation
we release our fears and we ...
i never want to work that hard
touch our souls .
that i can talk to
i want you just the way you are
sharrona , wait !
carry on , the guru's just gone to the restroom .
i need to know that you will always be
remember , sex is good for you .
the same old someone that i knew
love your loins .
i meant to tell you .
you certainly had a deal , didn't you?
you pay me , steal my private thoughts , and sell them to the world .
i told you things i have never told anyone .
i tried to tell you , i did .
and then i wanted your philosophy , and then i wanted to see you .
that is why .
i just wanted to see you .
you're sick , you know .
and mean .
how could you lie like that?
you tell me , mrs. schoolteacher .
what about rusty?
you're lying to him and to yourself .
that's not true !
you think no one will love you for you , so you pretend to be someone else .
don't you see?
that is not real .
what is that?
guru speak?
it's true .
maybe i'm a bad person who deserves to be stabbed in the heart ... but i know you deserve more .
you're just a stupid con man .
go steal those people's money ... before they realise that you're just a big dumb fake !
i'm a fake?
well , then you're a super fake .
a porno star saying you're a teacher , for a house in frog's neck !
throg's neck .
i plan to be very happy there .
you better go steal those people's money before your visa expires !
okay , i will !
taxi !
i'll be rich , and famous , and very , very happy !
fine !
fine !
taxi !
hello , girls , come on .
ready for some fun?
this is amit and sanjiv .
this is candy , mindy , sandy , daisy and tasha .
i just ...
beautiful jungle top .
you are a heartbreaker , baby .
the great thing about this place is we never have to move .
they can carry us out of here in a box .
anthony , i'm waiting for you !
all right !
we got it .
ten cents for every guru of sex t shirt sold .
maybe we could donate the proceeds .
maybe .
not .
you know , i'm sick of your fucking materialism !
i'm sick of your fucking scented oils .
you smell like a bombay hooker .
ramu , we've got the cher party tonight .
sally jessy raphael tomorrow .
hey , man , did you hear me?
did it ever occur to you he might be meditating?
no .
guru .
vijay rao , the guru's manager .
hello , girls , all right there .
ramu's coming in there .
all right , then .
vijay rao , manager .
hey , man .
tony called .

i don't know .
i don't have all the answers like you , guruji .
he said your wedding cake will be ready tomorrow 9 : 00 a . m .
are you getting married tomorrow?
no , i'm not getting married tomorrow .
i never know with you , yaar .
you better shape up
'cause i need a man
and my heart is set on you and my heart is set on you

i'm double parked .
why did they send the cake here?
it's supposed to go to the reception hall .
i'm so sorry .
just leave it right there .
she's just a nervous bride .
i'll get my purse .
i won't be a jiffy .
it's terrible what i did to you .
i know that .
but what you're about to do ...
don't go through with this .
you don't have to .
you and me ...
there is no you and me .
you used me .
and i used you , too .
and i did it for the cake .
here you are , sir .
good bye .
and thank you .
all righty , then .
vij , i can't go in there .
what the fuck you talking about?
i know you love it .
the clothes and everything ... but it's not real .
i can't do this anymore .
you're serious .
but , ram , you've made it .
you're a star .
i don't care .
of course you do .
remember , yaar , we came here with nothing .
and look at us now .
you've made it for all of us .
think about your family , how proud they'll be .
come on , yaar .
hey , is that him?
oh , it's him .
it's guru .
right this way .
okay , i'm your cousin kimberly .
i'm a librarian , and i have five children , all boys .
i like that part .
and , i live in utica .
ithaca .
you live in lthaca .
and you run a head start program there .
okay .
head .
head , i can remember that .
i'm cutting the cake , not jumping out of it .
okay .
honey , what's wrong?
why are you crying?
i don't know .
oh , honey .
they're just tears of joy or something .
honey , no .
no , the makeup .
waldo hernandez .
waldo .
and what do you do?
i'm in the meat packing industry .
hi .
pretend i'm not here .
marsha !
and now i'm happy to introduce a true phenomenon ... the guru of sex , ramu gupta .
ramu gupta will be taking calls , and he will be talking about ... well , what he talks about , sexual intercourse .
mama !
ramu's on sally jessy raphael .
well , first i'd just like to say hi to my family .
hi , nanima .
he said hi to me .
what's he doing?
he's talking about sexual intercourse .
what?
candy , make sure everything is in tiptop shape .
oh , yes .
mrs. von austerberg is very demanding .
yes , i know .
so am i.
welcome back .
the guru of sex ...
ramu gupta .
look , it's our guru .
our next question is from ...
john .
guru , my problem is that the only way i've been ... able to get a woman is on the computer .
well , john , don't limit yourself .
maybe sometimes on the computer , other times on the bed .
don't be afraid to try new things , huh?
next , we have a caller from alaska .
go ahead , caller .
yes , hi .
i'm supposed to get married .
congratulations .
yeah , but the problem is the girl i'm marrying .
she's awesome , but i don't really love her .
does your fiancee know how you feel?
no , she has no idea .
and i know it would kill her .
well , alaska ...
come on ! ... the best advice i can give you is ... to move your feet to the beat of your heart .
but my heart beats for the second hoseman on my truck .
then you must go to the hoseman , alaska .
you must go to the hoseman .
he doesn't seem himself .
i feel sorry for the girl marrying the homo .
it's quite a responsibility being a spiritual guru , isn't it?
yeah , it is .
but there is something i have to say .
i am not a guru .
what?
there goes the book deal .
all i've ever done is ... is to teach dance .
what?
i tried to act .
i came to america to be in movies ... well , to be on tv .
but i'm a fake .
i have betrayed you all and ...
i am sorry , i ...
i have to go .
all your wisdom ...
it was just an act .
but , i gave up all my stuff .
i am sorry .
i'm a fake .
what does that make me?
i now have all these ideas , and they came from me ... not from vanity fair or my mother .
how can you say that's fake?
it's not .
no , i didn't change you .
the guru you saw in me was the guru in you .
in your lie i found my truth .
come on , vij .
thanks our lexi .
what are we doing?
where are we going?
to get the woman i love .
hey , can you get to the bronx in 15 minutes?
i'm a cab driver .
i can get to bombay in 15 minutes .
i'm so proud of you .
this whole thing has made me want to go back to documentaries .
she's marrying someone else .
you can't interrupt a wedding and take the bride .
sure i can .
haven't you seen any american movies?
it happens here all the time .
about fucking time , man .
don't speak to me like that .
come on .
just don't forget , i'm the one doing you a favour .
right .
dearly beloved , we are gathered here in the sight of god ... to witness the sacrament of marriage .
it was your stupid idea .
vij , you're a real bastard .
rammy .
is that your plumber?
carry on .
thank you .
... should not be joined together in holy matrimony speak now ... or forever hold your peace .
i do .
randy .
who are they?
the new village people?
you first .
you first .
no , you first .
no , you first .
i insist .
come on , man .
if you please , i am trying to conduct a wedding ceremony here .
but i thought you said we could speak now .
it was merely an expression as in " get lost . " please leave .
i can't leave .
because if i leave ...
i leave everything that matters to me .
sharrona , you have taught me so much about so many things ... but right now i know something you don't .
this is just a dream .
maybe you've had it for so long you think it has to become real ... but it doesn't .
we live , and life brings us new dreams .
better ones .
ones that come from the heart , and not from the mind .
dreams that you cannot predict ...
like you .
that is why i cannot leave ... because my heart beats for that lady up there .
and i am not leaving here until i find out if her heart beats for me .
well , sherri?
yes , my heart beats for you .
thanks the indian fella couldn't get it up .
i thought you said he was native american .
yeah .
and you , young man .
why are you here?
i agree with him .
well , proceed .
i'm not paid by the hour .
rusty .
my heart beats for rusty .
thanks good .
get that .
i'm on it .
good angle for her .
russell , we always knew you swam upstream .
amen .
come here , baby .
there's a market for this .
yeah .
my little firebug .
there you go , ma'am .
peg , get over it .
well , enough of this swapping of spit .
let's celebrate !
yeah !
