manhattan lsland derives its name from its earliest inhabitants ... ... the manhattan lndians .
they were a peaceful tribe , setting traps , fishing , hunting .
every july , when the heat became unbearable ... ... they would send their wives and children away .
up the river to the highlands ... ... or , if they could afford it , to the seashore .
setting traps , fishing and hunting .
our story has nothing whatsoever to do with lndians .
lt plays 500 years later .
portland , rockland , plymouth and bar harbor .
departing at 6 : 30 ....
we brought up the subject to show how nothing has changed .
manhattan wives and children are still sent away in the summer .
setting traps , fishing and hunting .
we want you to meet a typical manhattan husband .
this is mr. richard sherman , his wife , helen , and son , ricky .
ricky , what are you doing?
he's an interplanetary spy .
i blasted him into dust .
cut it out .
you're going to maine , not to mars .
goodbye , helen .
goodbye , richard .
why can't daddy come up with us?
daddy has to stay and make money .
don't worry .
i'll be fine .
how will i get my allowance?
i'll mail it to you .
you promised to eat properly and not smoke .
and you promised not to drink .
i'll call you tonight at 10 .
goodbye , helen .
goodbye , ricky .
let me kiss you .
take that thing off .
he's shutting off my oxygen !
come on , we'll miss the train .
helen , ricky , the paddle !
you forgot the paddle !
ticket , mister?
my son forgot the paddle .
sorry , only those holding tickets admitted through the gates .
oh , no , not me .
and i'm not gonna smoke either .
look at them .
awful .
the train isn't even out of the station .
gotta get back to the office .
man , is this hot !
he works for a publishing firm , brady & company .
they publish those pocket editions , two bits in any drugstore .
old mr. brady is the boss , but mr. sherman is the key man .
he keeps the whole operation together .
ln the 25 cent book business , you can sell anything .
even the old , dreary classics .
the trick is to soup up the title ... ... and get an interesting cover .
lt's all a question of imagination ... ... and mr. sherman has a lot of imagination .
that'll be all , miss morris .
oh , no , not me .
not me .
and i'm not gonna smoke either .
some husbands run wild because their wives are away .
do anything they want .
like charlie lederer .
annie was gone two days ... ... when charlie got himself tattooed .
green dragon on his chest , butterfly on the shoulders .
not me .
oh , no , work , work
i'll work till 6 , then have dinner at the saloon
no !
no saloon , no drinking like dr. summers said .
i know , i'll try that vegetarian restaurant .
health food , that's the stuff .
the human body is a very delicate machine .
you can't run it on martinis and goulash .
especially in this hot weather .
miss , may i have the check , please?
yes , sir .
let's see .
we had the special , the soybean hamburger ... ... with french fried soybeans .
soybean sherbet and peppermint tea .
i had a cocktail to start .
yes , we had the sauerkraut juice on the rocks .
you'll be proud to know that the meal was only 260 calories .
i am proud .
that'll be $1 . 27 .
keep the change .
we don't permit tipping .
i can put it in our nudist camp fund .
you do that .
oh , thank you , sir .
it's a worthy cause .
we must bring the message to the people .
to unmask our suffocating bodies and let them breathe again .
without clothes there'd be no sickness and no war .
can you imagine two armies on the battlefield ... ... no uniforms , completely nude?
no way of telling friend from foe , all brothers together .
just a moment , sir .
you forgot your paddle .
thank you .
i like this house .
why does helen want to move into one of those ... ... buildings out of riot in cellblock 11?
so much nicer here .
just three apartments .
ours , kaufmans upstairs ... ... and two guys on the top , interior decorators or something .
it's peaceful with everybody gone .
sure is peaceful .
no howdy doody .
no captain video .
no smell of cooking .
no " what happened at the office?
i shot mr. brady in the head , made violent love to miss morris ... ... and set fire to 300, 000 copies of little women .
that's what happened .
what can happen at the office?
it sure is peaceful .
use the opener , richard .
carbonated water , citric acid , corn syrup ... ... artificial raspberry flavoring ... ... vegetable colors and preservative .
why is this stuff better for you ... ... than a little scotch and a twist of lemon?
i'd really like to know .
helen's gonna call at 10 .
i guess i better do a little reading .
i brought dr. brubaker's manuscript home with me
ricky !
okay , where is it?
where is the other one?
i know it's lurking here somewhere to get me .
where is captain video's other roller skate?
now , who's that?
yes , what is it?
i'm sorry to bother you .
i forgot my key , so i had to ring your bell .
it's perfectly all right .
anytime .
anything else i can do for you?
would you mind pressing it again?
my fan's caught in the door .
oh , of course .
thanks .
do you live in our building?
ln the kaufmans 'apartment .
they're in europe .
i know you'll be happy here .
it's a very quiet building .
no dogs , no children , just two interior decorators .
and you , and of course , me .
you all right?
oh , sure , fine .
well , good night .
good night .
well , now .
maybe i should have asked her in for a drink .
make her feel at home .
after all , we're one big family here .
oh , no , no .
i've got to get to work on the brubaker book .
i'm gonna talk to him about it tomorrow , so i better .
of man and the unconscious , by dr. ludwig brubaker .
some title .
we'll have to soup this one up , that's for sure .
ten o'clock .
helen's not gonna call till 10 : 00 .
i hope this thing keeps me awake till 10 : 00 .
the repressed urge in the middle aged male .
lts roots and lts consequences .
helen has a lot of nerve calling me at 10 : 00 .
it shows a definite lack of trust .
what does she think i'm gonna do?
start smoking?
get drunk?
or tattooed?
charlie ....
big , green dragon .
i bet she thinks i'll have girls up here .
that's terrible .
seven years we've been married .
i've never done anything like that .
don't think i couldn't have either .
because i could have , plenty .
plenty .
don't laugh , helen .
i happen to be very attractive to women .
you're attractive to me , but i'm used to you .
this isn't a thing one likes to tell his wife ... ... but women have been throwing themselves at me for years .
that's right , beautiful ones , plenty of them .
acres and acres of them .
name one .
it's hard just offhand , but there have been plenty of them .
you asked for it .
take my secretary , for instance .
to you , she's just miss morris , a piece of office furniture .
ten fingers to type my letters .
well , let me tell you .
did you type this letter?
yes , mr. sherman .
there are six errors in the first paragraph .
what is the matter with you?
what's the matter with you?
i'll tell you what's the matter .
i'm in love with you .
i have been since the day i came here .
deeply , madly , desperately , all consumingly .
and to you i'm nothing , just a piece of furniture .
ten fingers to type your letters with .
mr. sherman , take a look at me .
i'm a woman , do you hear?
with flesh and blood and nerves and feelings !
i'm in love with you .
i need you , i want you .
i want you ....
that will be all , miss morris .
you remember that torn shirt , helen?
now you know how it happened .
it got torn at the laundry , that's how it happened .
what an imagination !
i walk into a room and they sense it .
i arouse something in them , i bother them .
it's a kind of animal thing i've got .
it's quite extraordinary .
the only extraordinary thing is your imagination .
last winter when i had my appendix out ... ... do you remember the nurse?
that sweet , little old lady with the gray hair?
that was the day nurse .
you never saw the night nurse , a certain miss finch .
poor miss finch .
she fought it as long as she could .
but then one night ....
richard !
miss finch , please , not again tonight .
we have so little time .
soon they'll take out your stitches and i'll have lost you forever .
please , miss finch .
there is such a thing as ethics .
remember , you are a registered nurse .
ethics?
once i had ethics .
once i was young .
once i had ideals .
i was registered !
and then you happened .
miss finch , for five nights now you've been taking my pulse .
have you never noticed this simple band of gold?
you've bothered me since they wheeled you into the operating room .
i can't understand it .
there's this animal thing about you .
please , miss finch , my adhesions .
let's crash out of here .
let's steal an ambulance .
you're not fit to wear that uniform .
you're rotten to the core .
beat me till your arms ache .
i'll only come crawling back for more .
you're forcing me to take measures ... ... to protect you from yourself .
no , no !
put me down !
put me down !
the moth and the flame , that's what it was .
poor miss finch .
i hope i didn't singe her wings too badly .
you read too many books and see too many movies .
for instance , take elaine .
your best friend , your bridesmaid .
let me tell you about that weekend in westport last summer .
you were playing canasta , suspecting nothing .
elaine and i went for a walk .
walk !
we went swimming , moonlight swimming .
what is this strange animal thing you have?
it bothers me .
it's bothered me since the first time i saw you .
and it'll bother me always , from here to eternity .
you must fight it , elaine .
remember , i belong to another .
richard !
this can never be .
i have a devoted , trusting wife at home .
and a freckle faced little space cadet .
richard !
so , helen , in light of the circumstances ... ... l resent your calling to check up on me .
don't worry about me .
although i have tremendous personal magnetism ... ... l also have strength of character .
and tremendous imagination .
you've begun to imagine it cinemascope , with stereophonic sound .
well ... ... back to work .
the repressed urge in the middle aged male . lts roots and lts consequences .
helen is worried .
i just know she is .
she plays it cool , but she can't fool me .
why else would she call in the middle of the night?
she probably figures she isn't as young as she was .
she's 31 .
one day she'll wake up and find her looks are gone .
no wonder she's worried .
i don't look different than i did when i was 28 .
it's not my fault , it's just a simple biological fact .
women age quicker than men .
i won't look different when i'm 60 .
i have that kind of a face .
everybody'll think she's my mother .
hello , mother?
oh , helen !
i wasn't expecting you to call till 10 .
everything all right?
everything's fine here .
seems pretty empty without you , though .
just sitting out on the terrace ... ... drinking , getting fractured on raspberry soda .
little ricky okay?
oh , he did?
he hasn't done that for a long time .
it's the excitement .
that's nice .
who did you meet on the train?
tom mackenzie?
what's he doing up there?
my advice is to avoid tom like the plague .
i don't want him carrying ricky's kayak .
lf anybody carries ricky's kayak , it's gonna be you .
how's the weather?
cool?
it's steaming here , like an oven .
yeah , i'm pretty tired myself .
night .
good night , darling .
the repressed urge in the middle aged male .
lts roots and lts consequences .
maybe a twist of lemon would help this , or a shot of worcestershire .
hey , what's the big idea? !
you wanna kill somebody?
what's the matter?
this great cast iron pot ... ... practically killed me .
oh , it's you .
well , hello again .
what happened?
oh , the tomato plant fell over !
it sure did .
i'm terribly sorry .
it's nothing .
look at that poor chair !
i'll pay for it .
i hope it's not some priceless antique .
it's just early sears , roebuck .
lf there's anything i can do ....
do what?
there's nothing to worry about .
i'm certainly glad you're not mad .
now don't touch it .
i'll have the janitor come down ... ... and take care of it .
good night .
hey there !
wait a minute .
yes?
i'll tell you one thing you could do .
lf you're not doing anything else more important .
would you have a drink with me?
thanks , i'd love it .
you would?
sure , it'd be fun .
let me just go and put something on .
i get dressed in the kitchen .
when it's hot like this , i keep my undies in the icebox .
ln the icebox?
see you in a minute .
ln the icebox !
i really need it , dr. murphy .
honest i do .
don't worry , dr. murphy .
just one , that's all .
all those lovely injurious tars and resins .
and now a small concession from dr. summers?
doctor , let's be reasonable .
can't fly on one wing .
okay , i'll put some soda in it .
do you want to come in for a drink?
i'd love it .
just like that .
a beautiful girl too .
must be a model or actress .
atmosphere .
i need a little atmosphere .
tomato plant .
fan caught in the door .
what am i doing?
this is absolutely ridiculous .
the first night helen leaves , i'm bringing dames in here .
take it easy .
there's nothing wrong with asking a neighbor down for a drink .
i hope she doesn't get the wrong idea .
lf this dame thinks she's in for a big time , she's in for a surprise .
one drink and out !
i'm a happily married man .
maybe a little soft music .
she's probably getting all fixed up .
she'll probably wear some ice cold evening dress .
let's see .
debussy , ravel .
stravinsky .
stravinsky'd only scare her .
here's the baby , rachmaninoff .
give her the full treatment .
come in like gangbusters .
good old rachmaninoff .
the second piano concerto .
never misses .
you came .
i'm so glad .
rachmaninoff .
the second piano concerto .
it isn't fair .
not fair?
why?
every time i hear it , i go to pieces .
oh?
may i sit next to you?
please do .
it shakes me , it quakes me .
it makes me goose pimply all over .
i don't know where i am , or who i am , or what i'm doing .
don't stop , don't stop .
don't ever stop .
why did you stop?
you know why i stopped .
why?
because .
because now i'm going to kiss you ... ... very quickly and very hard .
one moment , my dear .
you came .
yeah , i came for the rugs .
the rugs?
what is it you want?
the bedroom rugs .
i promised mrs. sherman .
mr. kruhulik
it's on account of the moths .
forget the rugs .
your wife is gonna find them full of big , gaping holes .
who'll get blamed?
the janitor .
pick them up tomorrow while i'm at the office .
i can't .
i'm taking the missus and the kids to the train .
they're going to the country .
all right , in the afternoon then .
i can't do it then .
i'm going to the barber in the afternoon .
i'm gonna take a shave , haircut , manicure , the whole works .
i couldn't care less .
come tomorrow evening , just not now .
tomorrow evening?
do you know the maid from 531 park?
you must've seen her walking down the street with her fat poodle .
what?
come now , we're both summer bachelors .
don't let's be naive .
good night , mr. kruhulik !
big , fat poodle !
he's got four kids .
something happens to people in the summer .
it's disgraceful .
it's late .
where is she?
this is ridiculous .
she could've been here , had her drink and gone home already .
lce , we'll need ice .
coming !
coming , coming !
hi !
it's me .
don't you remember?
the tomato from upstairs .
of course , the tomato .
come in , please .
honestly , i don't know how it happened .
i was watering the plants .
i promised the kaufmans i would .
i was using the cocktail shaker .
it's the only thing i found .
a little silver one .
then there was this terrible crash .
you could've been killed .
it's probably criminal negligence .
you could've sued somebody .
me , probably .
well , not you .
you'd have been dead .
your lawyers could have .
case dismissed .
what would you like to drink?
i don't know .
anything .
you have a nice place here .
you live here alone?
yes , i live here alone .
all alone .
it's a roller skate .
mine , you know .
yours?
it's adjustable .
i skate a lot .
what would you like to drink?
you do drink?
sure , i drink like a fish .
do you have gin?
of course .
you mean straight gin?
no , gin and soda , i guess .
gin and soda?
that's wrong .
how do you drink gin?
there's gin and tonic , and gin and vermouth , that's a martini .
that sounds cool .
i'll have a glass of that .
a big , tall one .
big , tall martini .
this is a nicer apartment than the kaufmans '.
for instance , the kaufmans have no stairs .
hey , where do they lead to?
no place .
no place?
a stairway to nowhere .
that's elegant .
i wouldn't say elegant .
you see , this used to be a duplex .
the landlord made two apartments out of it by boarding up your floor .
oh , yes , i remember that patch in the floor .
i dropped my cuticle pusher down the crack .
cuticle pusher .
yeah .
well , here you are .
big , tall martini .
thanks .
you're welcome .
very good .
maybe it needs a bit more sugar .
i'd strongly advise against putting sugar in a martini .
you would?
why?
well ....
take my word for it .
no sugar in a martini .
back home they put sugar in martinis .
back home?
where?
denver , colorado .
hey , you've got air conditioning !
how does it work?
put it on .
sure !
i got air conditioning in every room .
don't the kaufmans?
no , it's just terrible up there .
that's why i bought the electric fan .
this feels just elegant .
i'm just not made for the heat .
it's my first summer in new york , and it's killing me .
yesterday , i tried to sleep in the bathtub .
just lying up to my neck in cold water .
good idea .
but the faucet kept dripping .
it was keeping me awake .
you know what i did?
i pushed my big toe up the faucet .
they call that american know how .
then my toe got stuck and i couldn't get it out again .
you couldn't?
but there's a phone in the bathroom .
i was able to call the plumber .
you called him?
he was very nice , even though it was sunday .
he rushed right over .
everything come out okay?
sure .
but it was embarrassing .
i can see how it might've been .
honestly , i almost died .
there i was with a strange plumber ... ... and no polish on my toenails .
you got a cigarette around?
a cigarette?
sure .
coming up .
here you are .
are you afraid of burglars?
i'm just trying not to smoke .
lf you don't see them , you don't think about them .
it's not 100 % / foolproof .
it's only a theory .
all you do is spend half your life dragging ladders back and forth .
you could break a leg .
it's just ridiculous .
at the club we had this girl who only smoked cigars .
she only did it to make herself look older .
what club was that?
this club i lived at .
i hated it .
you had to be in by 1 a . m .
now i can stay out all night .
i was glad when they practically asked me to leave .
why did they ask you to leave?
it was so silly .
i posed for a picture in u. s. camera and they got all upset .
what was wrong with the picture?
i was it was one of these artistic pictures .
on the beach , with driftwood .
it got honorable mention .
ln u. s. camera?
it was called " textures .
you'd see three different kinds .
the driftwood , the sand and me .
i got $25 an hour .
it took hours and hours .
very interesting line of work .
i don't do modeling anymore .
now i'm on tv every other week .
the dazzledent toothpaste hour .
you're an actress?
sort of .
i do the commercial part .
it's a good part .
they put gray makeup on my teeth ... ... to show ordinary toothpaste .
then they wipe it off to show how dazzledent works .
i sit like this for about 14 seconds ... ... and i get to speak lines too .
i had onions at lunch , i had garlic dressing at dinner .
but he'll never know .
i stay kissing sweet ... ... the new dazzledent way .
you do that beautifully .
thank you .
people don't realize , but when i show my teeth on tv ... ... l appear before more people ... ... than sarah bernhardt ever did .
something to think about .
it certainly is .
wish i were old enough to have seen her .
was she magnificent?
i wouldn't know .
i'm not that old myself .
i guess you're not really .
i'm 39 .
i will be in august .
at the moment i'm 38 .
thirty eight?
i was 22 , day before yesterday .
i didn't do anything about it .
i didn't tell anyone .
i did buy a bottle of champagne .
i thought i'd sit there , drink it by myself .
that sounds absolutely sad .
oh , no !
it would've been just elegant , lying in a bath , drinking champagne .
but i couldn't get the bottle open .
you couldn't?
there's nothing to it .
you think you could get it open?
i'm pretty sure i could .
i've got an idea .
i'll go up and get it .
it's in the icebox with the potato chips and my underwear .
do you have champagne glasses?
yes .
good !
we'll have a wonderful time .
the man says it's very good champagne .
shall i bring the potato chips too?
sure , let's shoot the works .
honorable mention in u. s. camera .
u. s. camera .
news events .
children and animals .
the human body .
champagne glasses .
champagne glasses .
phone , phone .
where's the phone?
hello?
who is it?
oh , helen .
well , this is a surprise !
and a pleasant one .
how are you?
sure , i'm all right .
why shouldn't i be all right?
ln what way do i sound funny?
everything is just fine .
what's your problem?
did i know ricky forgot his paddle?
i've been dragging that thing all over new york .
sure , i will .
i'll send it off first thing .
good night .
who?
who dropped in after dinner?
tom mackenzie?
good old tom .
how is he?
drinking?
who , me?
whatever gave you that idea?
i was sitting here reading a book about driftwood .
we may publish it .
it's interesting .
some of the formations are
i'd better hang up .
the bathtub is running over .
good night .
night !
sorry , i was on the phone .
a friend of mine in the country
oh , say !
it isn't right to drink champagne in pants .
would you mind fastening my straps?
oh , sure .
sure .
potato chips , champagne .
you really think you can get it open?
oh , yeah .
i've opened one or two before in my life .
it's simply a matter of pressure and counter pressure .
there she goes .
you've sure got powerful thumbs .
i used to play a lot of badminton .
get the glasses .
quick , quick !
the glasses !
pour it .
seems to be stuck .
that's silly .
give it a good yank .
this never happened before .
it must be the vacuum .
the bubbles create a vacuum .
let me see if i can do it .
i'll try to twist it .
you're married !
i am?
yes , i am .
i knew it .
i could tell .
you look married .
actually , my wife and i are separated .
separated in the sense that she went away for the summer .
any children?
no .
well , just one very little one .
it's cold in there .
finger's getting numb .
i could call the plumber .
he's very good at this .
no , let's keep the plumber out of it .
grab hold of the piano .
careful , i had my appendix out last year .
are you all right?
fine .
do you wanna waste it now that you know i'm married?
i think it's wonderful that you're married .
just elegant .
you do?
of course .
i wouldn't be lying on the floor with some man if he wasn't married .
that's an interesting line of reasoning .
with a married man it's so simple .
i mean , it can't possibly ever get drastic .
have a potato chip .
ln what sense can't it get drastic?
people keep falling in love with me .
i can believe it .
they get this strange idea .
i believe that too .
they ask me to marry them .
all the time .
i don't know why they do it .
maybe it's a kind of nervousness .
maybe .
i don't wanna get married .
not yet , anyway .
that'd be worse than living at the club .
i'd have to get in by 1 again .
very true , you would .
at least occasionally .
that's what's wonderful about a married man .
no matter what , he can't ask you to marry him .
he's married already .
right?
right .
you certainly don't have to worry about me .
am i ever a married man !
i'm the most married man you'll ever know .
and i promise ... ... l will never ask you to marry me , come what may .
well , how about some music?
fine .
let's see what we've got here .
debussy , ravel , stravinsky .
hey , how about this one?
rachmaninoff , the second piano concerto .
you look to me like a big rachmaninoff girl .
i do?
funny , i don't know anything about music .
you don't have to .
just listen to it , that's all .
this is classical music , isn't it?
i can tell .
there's no vocal .
don't talk .
don't fight it .
relax .
go limp .
like this?
yes .
let it sweep over you .
i got the biggest thing for eddie fisher .
frequently , people go to pieces listening to this .
no kidding?
yes .
it quakes them .
it shakes them .
makes them goose pimply all over .
did you ever dunk a potato chip in champagne?
it's real crazy .
here .
lsn't that crazy?
yeah , pretty crazy .
we'd better send rachmaninoff off .
this wasn't such a good idea .
don't worry , everything's fine .
a married man , air conditioning ... ... champagne and potato chips .
it's a wonderful party .
hey !
look , you've got u. s. camera !
i do?
how about that !
i've got u. s. camera .
i bought a dozen copies of this but people kept stealing them .
why would they do that?
that's me , right there on the beach .
my hair was a little longer then .
did you notice?
no , i didn't .
let me ask you something .
when they took this , there must've been some passersby .
other people around .
how did they keep the crowd back?
it was taken early in the morning .
nobody was up .
except you see that shadow?
ls it a sea gull?
no , a coast guard helicopter .
he kept buzzing the beach .
maybe you'd like me to autograph this before i leave .
you're not leaving yet , are you?
how about more champagne?
love some .
just freshen it .
oh , i'm awfully sorry .
here .
we should have some music .
do you play the piano?
not really .
not anymore .
i used to .
just a little as a child .
go ahead , play something .
well , all right .
let's see if i remember this .
it's a little tricky .
chopsticks " !
i can play that too .
shove over .
i don't know about that rachmaninoff , but this really gets me .
it does?
and how .
i can feel the goose pimples .
goose pimples?
don't stop .
don't stop .
why do you stop?
you know why .
because now i'm going to take you in my arms and kiss you ... ... very quickly and very hard .
hey , wait a minute !
what happened?
i lost track .
i don't know .
this is terrible .
there's nothing i can say .
except that i'm terribly sorry .
nothing like this ever happened to me before .
this happens to me all the time .
this is unforgivable .
the only possible excuse is that i'm not quite myself tonight .
maybe it'd be better if you would just go .
why?
you're being silly .
please go .
i must insist .
take your potato chips and go .
all right , if you really want me to .
good night .
good night .
i think you're very nice .
nice !
you're not nice .
you're crazy , that's what you are .
helen's gone for one day and you're running amuck .
smoking , drinking , picking up girls , playing " chopsticks .
you're not gonna live through this summer .
not like this .
look at those bloodshot eyes .
look at that face , ravaged , dissipated , evil .
one morning you'll look in the mirror and that's all .
the portrait of dorian gray .
good morning , mr. sherman .
good morning , miss morris .
mr. brady get in yet?
yes , he came in early .
i wanna see him .
put this on my desk .
of course .
would you like me to get coffee and a doughnut?
no , thank you .
have you had breakfast , with the family away?
i'm capable of fixing my own breakfast .
i had a peanut butter sandwich and two whiskey sours .
mr. brady .
oh , sherman , come in .
well , what is it?
i've been with this company for years , and i've never asked for a favor .
you had a raise in february .
i'm not talking about that .
this is more important than money .
i want two weeks off to join my wife and son in the country .
this is our busy season .
we're preparing our fall list .
i'm very tense and upset .
i'm on the verge of a breakdown .
lf i could get back with my wife
how long have you been married?
seven years .
ln a few years , you'll be delighted to get rid of them for the summer .
shipped them to nantucket yesterday afternoon ... ... and i haven't been to bed since .
drank bourbon , smoked cigars , played poker till this morning .
came to the office .
never felt better in my life .
i may not go to bed at all till the family gets back in september .
lf i stay in new york alone ... ... there's a chance i may not live to see september .
that's ridiculous , sherman .
you're just a little lonely .
what about us teaming up tonight , seeing if we can get lucky?
it doesn't have to be just poker .
we'll cut loose and have us a real hootenanny .
it's very kind of you , but i don't think no hootenannies .
suit yourself , but i've been thinking about that fall list .
what would you think of a 25 cent reprint ...
... of the portrait of dorian gray?
dorian gray?
look what we'll be giving them for a quarter !
vice , lust and corruption .
on the surface , clear eyed and healthy , just like you .
but underneath , dry rot .
the termites of sin and depravity , gnawing at his soul .
how does that strike you?
no , no .
no .
the lnfidelity pattern in the married male ... ... or the 'seven year itch . '
a study of 18, 000 marriages conducted by myself ... ... leads us to believe that the 'urge curve 'in the husband ... ... rises sharply during the seventh year .
this phenomenon is humorously ... ... referred to as the seven year itch .
far from humorous , this unfortunate urge ... ... strikes 84 . 6 % / of the married male population ... ... rising to an alarming 91 . 8 % / during the summer months .
changed my mind .
gustaf meyerheim , the mad lover of leipzig .
an extreme , but not unusual case of the seven year itch ... ... occurred in leipzig , germany in 1912 .
gustaf meyerheim , happily married for seven years ... ... suddenly " seven years !
dr. brubaker to see mr. sherman .
doctor , you're early .
yes , my 3 : 00 patient jumped out of the window .
so i'm ahead of schedule .
which door?
this one .
good afternoon , mr. sherman .
dr. brubaker .
i see you've been working on my book .
it's a wonderful book .
very important .
it has something for everyone .
yes .
you'll be happy to know that we're giving it a big promotion .
you'll be seeing this in every drugstore in america .
" of sex and violence "?
we had to soup up the title .
what does this represent?
gustaf meyerheim , the mad lover of leipzig ... ... terrorizing one of his victims .
lsn't that sensational?
may i remind you that meyerheim was small , with a red beard?
nobody knows that .
they know it in leipzig .
and all his victims were middle aged women .
don't you think it'd be more effective ... ... to show a man terrorizing a young girl , sales wise?
i'm not a salesman .
i'm a doctor .
i heal sick minds .
i find ways to root out insecurities , neuroses , inner tensions ....
what is it?
what are you looking at?
nothing .
does that mean something , doctor?
no , nothing serious .
dark clouds on the psychic horizon .
that's preposterous .
a twitch in a thumb , a nerve or a muscle .
you psychiatrists make a case out of it .
of all the ridiculous ....
are you very expensive?
very .
i'm sure you make exceptions .
never .
lf a case really interests you?
at $50 an hour , all my cases interest me .
lf you run into something spectacular , another gustaf meyerheim
you wouldn't believe this , but last night ... ... l found myself terrorizing a young lady .
that could account for the thumb .
actually , it wasn't that bad .
i just made a little boo boo .
psychoanalysis doesn't recognize the boo boo as such .
everything is unconscious .
i was completely conscious .
i told her to take her potato chips and go .
potato chips . lf you please ....
all right , doctor .
i'm in serious trouble .
i'm married .
serious trouble .
married .
so far , normal .
i've been married for seven years .
i'm coming down with what you call the seven year itch .
what am i going to do?
lf something itches , scratch .
i scratched .
there was this lady .
everything went black .
i terrorized her , i attempted to terrorize her .
the attempt was unsuccessful?
definitely .
all i did was knock us both off the piano bench .
let me understand .
you attempted to terrorize ... ... a young lady on a piano bench?
yes .
and on whose person was this attempt committed?
here , doctor .
i brought this with me .
i didn't wanna leave it lying around the house .
that's her .
her hair was a little longer then .
it's called " textures " because you can see three different textures .
it got honorable mention .
splendid .
i congratulate you on your good taste .
lnteresting driftwood formation too .
i'll give you my advice .
do not attempt it again .
but if you should , give yourself room to work in .
do not attempt it balanced on a piano bench .
such an attempt is doomed .
i love my wife .
don't we all?
your time is up .
lf you find yourself in need of further analysis , phone my office .
as for my book , we'll resume discussion as your ... has subsided .
lf she tells anybody about this , i'll kill her with my bare hands .
a possible solution .
but murder is the most difficult crime to commit .
until you can commit a simple act of terror ... ... l strongly advise you to avoid anything so complex .
one must learn to walk before one can run .
goodbye .
i'm in big trouble .
girls like this can't keep their mouths shut .
this'll be all over new york .
i bet right this minute she's telling someone about it .
he lured me in his apartment .
he made me sit on his piano bench .
he made me play " chopsticks .
then he turned on me .
he was frothing at the mouth ... ... just like the creature from the black lagoon !
i knew it .
i knew it !
that's how these stories get started .
big blabbermouth .
then he lured her into his apartment ... ... pretended he wasn't married .
he forced her onto the piano bench .
i know him very well .
he was in here for dinner , 260 calories .
he forced her to sit on the piano bench ... ... and then he made her play " chopsticks .
the word is spreading .
it's spreading .
it's like jungle drums .
everybody knows about it .
everybody's talking about it .
television !
i forgot she's on television .
50 million tv sets in america .
and now with the coaxial cable ... !
i had onions at lunch .
i had garlic dressing at dinner .
but he'll never know ... ... because i stay kissing sweet the new dazzledent way .
now that i have your attention , i want to warn all you girls ... ... about an evil , dangerous , married man ... ... living downstairs in my building .
his name is richard sherman .
s h e r m a n.
while his wife and son are in maine ... ... this monster is terrorizing the girls of new york .
mommy , come quick !
they're talking about daddy .
he makes them sit on the piano bench ... ... and makes them play " chopsticks .
then suddenly he turns on them ... ... just like the creature from the black lagoon !
well , i might as well face it .
she knows everything .
she knows , she knows , she knows .
but maybe she doesn't .
maybe there isn't any tv up in maine .
i can't go on like this .
why don't i just call helen?
the minute i heard her voice , i could tell if she knew anything .
all right , call her .
hello , long distance?
i want ogunquit , maine .
ogunquit 42831 j. yeah , thanks .
what's taking so long?
maybe she's talking to the lawyers already .
hello , hello?
helen?
bad connection .
who?
who is this?
i wanna talk to mrs. sherman .
who is this?
oh , the babysitter .
look , this is mr. sherman .
where is mrs. sherman?
what do you mean she's on a hayride?
with whom is she on a hayride?
mr. mackenzie and some people?
what people?
she did leave a message?
what was the message?
ricky's paddle .
no , i forgot .
something came up .
i'll send it first thing in the morning .
goodbye !
mr. sherman?
what is it , miss morris?
it's after 6 .
do you need me anymore tonight?
no .
we've come to the end of a perfect day .
let's go home and enjoy the simple things .
the good things , the real things .
the laughter of a child .
a flight of swallows winging their way back home .
life can be beautiful , miss morris .
hey !
good evening .
i just washed my hair .
that's nice .
goodbye .
oh , no , not tonight .
this girl's a pistol .
got away with it once .
why press my luck?
it's gonna be quiet around here tonight .
i promise you that .
take a shower , poach an egg , rinse a shirt , hit the sack ... ... and that's all .
lf she was washing her hair for me , is she kidding?
helen , what a wife !
how lucky can you get?
i'm glad she's having a good time .
people to go out with , take her on hayrides .
one thing , though .
what's she doing on a hayride with mackenzie?
i wish she wouldn't hang around people like that .
he's capable of making a pass at her .
she'll probably like it .
she's getting older .
i'm probably very dull .
and mackenzie is a writer .
a lousy writer .
that last book of his !
all that downwardly pulsating ... ... and hair spilled across the pillow .
no woman is safe around a guy who writes stuff like that .
no , tom , please .
the other people !
i have a confession to make .
look around .
there are no other people .
don't be angry .
i should be .
no , tom .
what about the driver?
there is no driver .
no driver?
i thought of everything .
even the horses are wearing blinkers .
tom , i'm afraid .
afraid?
of me?
no , of me .
oh , darling !
downwardly , pulsating , striving .
now together , ending and unending .
now , now , now !
what a cornball .
okay , good luck .
lf that's the way you wanna play it , i can play it that way too !
kaufman .
kaufman .
kaufman .
hi !
did you know you left your tomato plant down here last night?
i'd be glad to bring it up .
maybe you'd like to have dinner .
then maybe we could go to an air conditioned movie .
didn't you love the picture?
i did .
but i just felt so sorry for the creature at the end .
sorry?
what , did you want him to marry the girl?
he was scary looking , but he wasn't really all bad .
he just craved a little affection .
a sense of being loved and needed and wanted .
that's an interesting point of view .
do you feel the breeze from the subway?
lsn't it delicious?
sort of cools the ankles .
what would be fun to do now?
it's getting pretty late .
not that late .
i have this big day tomorrow .
i have to get to sleep .
what's the big day?
tomorrow i'm on tv .
i told you , the dazzledent hour .
oh , here comes another one .
tell me , dazzledent toothpaste , i don't think i ever tried it .
you should .
it's excellent .
oh , yes , i use it myself .
then you do recommend it?
definitely .
it costs a little more , but 8 out of 10 oral hygienists
you sound like a commercial .
lf i believed commercials ....
you can believe this one .
what's that you say?
he'll never know .
i stay kissing sweet the new dazzledent way "?
now really .
it's true !
i'll prove it to you .
well?
my faith in the integrity of advertising is restored .
however , before i switch brands , i wanna make absolutely certain .
a successful businessman like kaufman ... ... probably makes 15, 000 a year .
spends a fortune on sculptures but will not put in air conditioning .
i bet it was 95 in the bedroom last night .
poor kid , it's awful .
good night .
lf you wanted to drop by my place to cool off ... ... before you face that turkish bath up there ....
i left the air conditioning on full blast .
it's cold in there .
maybe for a few minutes .
to bring the body temperature down .
i feel no matter how much it costs ... ... if you've got to sell the kids 'bonds ... ... l say in the summertime in new york ... ... you've got to have air conditioning .
just feel that .
i didn't tell you , but i have air conditioning in every room .
the kitchen , the bathroom , the bedroom .
heaven !
you just relax .
i'll fix two drinks , and we'll have a nice , quiet talk .
this is really the most !
well , what shall we talk about?
how about psychoanalysis?
i don't know how much you know about it , but it's a hobby of mine .
i like to wander through the labyrinth of the human mind .
what gets me is spending $3 . 95 for that miserable fan .
it's absolutely useless .
i'll take it back to the store to get my money back .
just hope i didn't lose the sales slip .
two days ago we were strangers ... ... and now you're here alone with me .
how did it happen?
why did we meet?
the answer lies in the unconscious .
lf they won't take back the fan , the larger size is only $3 more .
but what about tonight?
i've just got to get some sleep .
you think that plant fell by itself?
there are no accidents .
nothing happens by itself .
we make it happen .
you didn't accidentally brush the plant , you pushed it .
maybe if i took the fan , put it in the icebox ... ... and left the door open ... ... then left the bedroom door open and soaked the sheets in ice water ....
no , that's too icky .
your behavior is obvious .
you pushed the plant down to kill me .
and why do you suppose you wanted to?
could it be , could it possibly be because you love me?
of course i could simply ask him if i'm sure he wouldn't mind .
he's such a nice man .
nothing to be ashamed of .
under this veneer we're all savages .
man , woman , hopelessly enmeshed .
we're on a toboggan , we can't stop .
it's too late to run .
the beguine has begun .
what are we going to do?
i've been thinking about it and i ....
yes?
i'd like to stay here with you tonight .
i'd like to sleep here .
are you sure?
that is , if you don't mind .
it's not a question of minding .
we don't wanna rush into this .
there are savages , and savages .
this may be too savage .
lf you want to spend an hour here
don't make me go to that hot apartment .
i haven't slept in three nights .
i'd like to look good tomorrow .
i could sleep right here in this chair .
i'll be as quiet as a mouse .
you won't know i'm around .
please?
well , that's different .
of course you can sleep here .
we're not savages .
we're civilized people .
thank you .
what time do you get up?
about 8 , i guess .
i'll fix you breakfast .
fix my breakfast wait a minute .
suppose someone sees you leaving the apartment at 8 .
just one person sees you , and we're dead .
all right then , i could get up at 6 and sneak upstairs .
get up at 6 and sneak sneak !
even worse .
suppose someone sees you sneaking out?
we're not doing anything wrong .
certainly , but there's such a thing as society , laws , rules .
but after all , no man is an island .
who is it?
it's me , mr. kruhulik .
what is it?
i was just coming home .
went out with a lady , the one with the big , fat poodle .
i saw your light .
i thought it might be a good time to pick up the rugs .
at 1 : 30 in the morning?
are you out of your mind?
i promised your wife .
those moths are probably right now chewing away big , gaping holes .
stop worrying .
i give you my word ... ... the moths are not eating anything .
come tomorrow , early , before they have their breakfast .
you can't trust a moth , mr. sherman .
they get hungry at night ... ... so they start looking around for a snack and
oh , i wish i was dead .
what's the matter?
i'm sorry .
i didn't quite understand the situation .
ln a situation like this , who cares about moths?
situation , mr. kruhulik?
what situation?
moths?
let them eat the rugs .
let them eat the curtains .
who cares?
go , man , go .
i'd like to explain this .
this may seem unusual .
but it's the most natural thing .
i'll say .
summertime , and the living is easy .
fish are jumping , cotton is high .
that's enough !
the young lady lives in this building .
there's been a terrible accident .
hi .
well , hello !
lsn't she a living doll?
this lady's tomato plant fell down .
sorry to disappoint , but that's all there is to it .
ln fact , i'm glad you dropped in .
you can help her take the plant upstairs .
it's here .
i watered the garden with a cocktail shaker .
a little silver shaker .
you can see your insinuations are preposterous .
a natural mistake , mr. sherman .
and my apologies to you , dear lady .
what a doll !
right out here , mr. kruhulik .
what a shambles .
it's all right .
we're covered .
i have a policy .
thank you , mr. kruhulik , and good night .
good night , miss whatever your name is .
be careful , it's heavy .
don't strain anything .
i'm strained already ... ... from carrying that big , fat poodle around .
i wish i was dead !
well , good night .
good night .
i'm sorry .
but you can see how it is .
i understand .
no man is an island .
normal .
everything is absolutely normal .
sleep .
go to sleep .
how can i possibly sleep?
what'll i do?
helen .
write to helen .
write a long letter to helen .
paddle , that's it .
i've got to send the paddle .
little ricky out there on the lake without a paddle .
wrap the paddle and send it off in the morning .
ricky needs it .
going to get his paddle .
how do you wrap a paddle , anyway?
paper and string , what else?
i need a piece of paper the shape of a paddle .
all right , nothing .
hey , there's some gauze in the bathroom .
i can bandage the whole thing , put some tape on it and
and what , send it up in an ambulance?
this is ridiculous .
people send paddles every day .
the mails are full of them .
how do they do it?
that's it , old newspapers !
big deal , old newspapers .
get a lot of string , slap it together ....
hi .
forgot about the stairs .
it was so easy .
i pulled out the nails .
you know what?
we can do this all summer .
miss .
young lady .
i've got to take a shower .
got to get to the office .
please , lady , get up , go home so i can get to the office .
please , lady?
no?
poor kid , working in new york in this heat .
and on television !
standing there under those hot lights .
she must need money real bad .
lives in an expensive apartment .
i know what clothes cost .
buys imported champagne .
how can she possibly afford?
she must have other sources of income .
plenty of ways a girl can get money if she's unscrupulous enough .
she could get herself some foolish , well to do married man .
trap him into some situation .
bleed him till he's white , squeeze him till he's dry
they have a word for this .
they call it " blackmail .
where is she?
she's with kruhulik .
they're down at the bank going through my safe deposit box .
hello , are you in there?
hi , good morning !
just taking a shower .
be out in a minute .
taking a shower , she'll be out in a minute , that's all .
i should get one of the new towels and take it to her .
that would very definitely be another boo boo .
lf anyone were to walk in , would they ever get the wrong idea .
cinnamon toast for two , strange blond in the shower .
explain that .
tell them you spent the night wrapping a paddle .
anybody walk in here !
who's gonna walk in here?
j. edgar hoover?
arthur godfrey?
helen , maybe?
she's in maine .
how could she get here?
on the train , that's how .
on the early morning train .
why would she be coming to new york?
because she knows something .
because someone tipped her off .
who could've tipped?
kruhulik !
he saw the girl here last night ... ... called helen long distance and told her everything .
she's on the train , i know it .
early morning train's in already .
she's in a cab .
she's on her way here .
she'll be here any second !
there's a woman in this apartment .
i know there is .
no , helen , it's not true .
don't lie to me , richard .
who told you?
was it kruhulik?
that's right .
i've had him watching you for months .
his name's not kruhulik .
he's a private eye named johnny dollar .
what are you going to do?
i'm going to shoot you .
i can explain everything .
the cinnamon toast , the shower .
this girl's from denver .
the kaufmans have no air conditioning .
spend a fortune on sculpture .
the drugstore wouldn't take back her fan , she lost the slip .
so i let her sleep in our bed .
i was just wrapping the paddle .
at least have the decency to keep the paddle of a child ... ... out of this sordid mess .
you're mad .
you'll never get away with this .
yes , i will .
there's such a thing as the unwritten law .
goodbye , richard .
give me another chance !
they'll give me a medal .
the wives of america will give me a medal !
helen , i'm going fast .
give me a cigarette .
a cigarette !
you know what dr. murphy told you about smoking .
a cigarette .
just one more cigarette , dr. murphy .
one more for the road .
for the long , long road .
hi .
what are you doing?
i need a cigarette .
they're right there on the table .
what's the matter with you?
i'm all shot .
it's because i took your bed and you slept on the couch .
i knew i should've taken the couch .
it's not the couch , it's my wife .
she found out about us and shot me .
she what?
five times in the back and twice in the belly .
you're just having a bad dream .
yeah , i guess so .
come on now .
everything's fine .
it's just my imagination .
some people have flat feet .
i have this appalling imagination .
i think it's just elegant .
i just have no imagination at all .
i have lots of other things .
i was standing in the kitchen .
then it occurred to me .
lf my wife walked in with you in the shower , she'd probably shoot me .
of course . lf i was married ... ... and came in on my husband making toast for a blond , i'd shoot him .
you would?
bang , bang , bang !
right in the head .
come on now , relax .
you're just making this all up .
that's right .
i don't suppose if she had come in she'd shoot me .
she'd be mad , maybe throw an ashtray .
just that?
she probably wouldn't even do that .
lf she found you in the shower ... ... she'd probably think you were the plumber .
a blond plumber?
absolutely .
she trusts me implicitly .
doesn't she love you?
oh , she loves me .
she worries about me .
i had a cough , and she made me stop smoking .
she loves me , all right .
lsn't she jealous?
not really .
how can anybody be jealous of somebody with a briefcase ... ... who's getting a little pot and can't keep his eyes open past 9?
she trusts me .
it'd never occur to her that l
last christmas , i came home with lipstick on my collar .
helen said , " what's that on your collar , cranberry sauce?
that's bad .
you know who kissed me?
mrs. brady .
face it , no pretty girl wants me , she wants gregory peck .
ls that so?
how do you know what a pretty girl wants?
i don't know , but i imagine
your imagination !
you think every girl's a dope .
you think a girl goes to a party and there's some guy ... ... in a fancy striped vest strutting around ... ... giving you that i'm so handsome you can't resist me look .
from this she's supposed to fall flat on her face .
well , she doesn't fall on her face .
but there's another guy in the room , over in the corner .
maybe he's nervous and shy and perspiring a little .
first , you look past him .
but then you sense that he's gentle and kind and worried .
that he'll be tender with you , nice and sweet .
that's what's really exciting .
lf i were your wife , i'd be very jealous of you .
i'd be very , very jealous .
i think you're just elegant .
thank you .
aren't you going to answer it?
answer what?
the doorbell .
go ahead , i'll put the cinnamon on the toast .
tom mackenzie !
morning , dickie boy .
what are you doing here?
don't call me " dickie boy .
got a date with my agent .
ls that coffee i smell?
no .
i'm glad i caught you .
we've got important family business to discuss .
are you sure that's not coffee?
positive .
my family?
i was driving down and helen asked me to stop by and ask you
she did?
i'm glad she did ... ... because i wanna talk to you .
what's the matter , dickie boy?
you think you're pretty fancy with the blinkers on the horses .
what blinkers?
what horses?
and no driver and no other people .
you drunk or something?
