i've lived in the theatre since i was a kid . what i don't know about acting isn't worth knowing . now , you may be 20 years old and just beginning , but i think you're a genius . you've got magnetism , but no idea how to use it . you have to grab the audience by the throat and say : " now , you buggers , you pay attention to me !
and remember this , when you're on the stage acting , theatre is the only reality .
everything else , the world outside , what civilians call the real world , is nothing but fantasy . and i bloody well won't let you forget it .
the trouble is , darling , i'm an incurable romantic .
i believe in love ,
i believe in happiness ,
i believe in us .
no , you don't . you're just saying that .
there's someone else , isn't there?
i love you , i do .
i do , i love you and i used to believe we'd live happily ever after .
didn't you? with every fiber of my being .
only now ... [ audience applauding ]
good morning , miss lambert . good morning , margery , is anyone with my lord and master?
no .
darling , what are you doing here?
i want an answer , michael . what's the question? what did i say to you before we went to sleep last night , hmm?
uh , i give up . what did you say to me before we went to sleep last night?
i said i was tired . it seems a perfectly natural thing to say before you go to sleep .
christ , michael , you can be an irritating little shit !
julia , julia , really , if your public could only hear your language .
i want them to hear .
i want every bloody one of them to hear .
i'm tired .
i am utterly exhausted .
i need a holiday . just admit it , michael . you've never understood what it means to carry a play , to sweat it out night after night .
i'm the only one who takes it seriously , michael , you know that . all you do is count the money and think it's a bloody great lark .
take the play off . but we'll lose a fortune . our partner won't like it . to hell with dolly !
i'm sorry , sweetheart . god , i didn't mean to be so vile . it's just i'm i'm near to breaking point .
everything's so tedious .
i want something to happen . what?
i wish i knew . please . please close the play at the end of the month .
yeah .
i really do have to think about it . we can't have the theatre dark .
hmm?
i'll try and see what i can do .
i promise . hmm? please .
i promise . thank you .
you were very quiet
leaving the house this morning . well , i didn't want to wake you . you were dead to the world . hmm .
i did my exercises and went for a run . exercises , running ... god , michael , you're the vainest man in london . me , vain? nonsense .
i just want to preserve my magnificent good looks for as long as possible .
oh , yes , speaking of good looks , did you notice that young man as you came in? no . he's an american . son of a friend of a friend of eddie gilbert's .
i can't see what that's got to do with me . he admires you tremendously . oh , he sounds frightfully intelligent . what's his name? can't remember . uh , unfortunately , he's as poor as a church mouse .
i thought we might give him a spot of lunch . well , he's awfully good mannered , for an american .
uh !
rubbish mail , margery . yes , mr. gosselyn . uh , i would like to introduce you to my wife ,
julia lambert .
julia , this is this is this is the young man i was telling you about . he wants to learn the business , so we're starting him off with our accountant . it it's an honor to meet you , miss lambert .
i wonder if we could persuade you to come and eat a chop with us .
michael will drive you back after lunch .
gee , that's real kind of you . you two take the lift , i'll take the stairs .
last one down's a sissy . miss lambert , could i could i ask you a favor?
i can't give you any more room , if that's what you mean . no , no , no , it's , uh ...
i wonder ... would you ... would you let me have a photograph? of course . gee , that's swell of you .
i've seen you in farewell , my love 3 times . you haven't . have you really? it's such a silly play . oh , it's not the play , it's you . you're just ... just great .
i'm glad you liked me .
liked you?
i loved you .
i won .
what? well done . come on , mr ... uh ...
all an actress like julia needs is a vehicle . it's the actors the public go to see , not the play . that's true in my case .
i'd see you in anything , miss lambert . but you know what i'd really like to find out? how did you start? how did you get to be where you are , owning a theatre , top of the tree? clean living and hard work . cigarette? we owe it all to a rude , foul mouthed brute called jimmie langton . we were in his repertory company in middlesbrough . he knew all there is to know about theatre and acting . that's where i met michael . that's how we began .
i was a rotten actor . yes , but you have presence . the audience always gasps when you come on . it's his dazzling good looks , you see . gee , this is fascinating . fascinating . dreadfully jealous of him? you're very sweet , but i know perfectly well that all i can play are diplomats , lawyers and politicians .
i'm more interested in the business side . that's yes , but you know as well as i do that we'd be nothing without jimmie .
i always lay a place for him at the table . just in case he turns up . he's been dead for 15 years . yes , but you never know . he was a monster .
uh , how do you spell your first name?
t o m .
hoy ! hoy ! hoy ! hoy ! hoy !
for god's sake , don't torture yourself like this , laura .
no one will ever know how much i loved him .
he was my earth , my moon , all the stars in the firmament .
farewell , my love .
bravo ! bravo !
no , there's nothing left for me now but to tour canada and australia , god help me . nonsense , miss lambert . it's not nonsense .
i've decided to retire and let myself go .
i'll have potatoes for lunch and potatoes for dinner .
beer . god , i love beer !
and treacle pudding and cherry tart and cream .
cream , cream , cream , cream , cream ... [ breathing deeply ]
as god is my judge ,
i'll never eat a lettuce leaf again .
oh , god , i bet i know who that is .
good afternoon , evie .
oh , mrs. de vries , what a surprise . uh , i hope this isn't inconvenient but i have to see miss lambert on a business matter . she isn't having one of her afternoon naps , is she?
wait a minute .
guess who's here . show her in . business , she says , but isn't it funny how she always manages to time her visits when you're lying stark bollock naked . enough of that , you dirty minded slut .
show her in .
mrs. de vries .
julia , darling . dolly , dear . hmm .
oh , i'm so sorry .
i always seem to call when you're you're otherwise engaged .
tea? lovely . ignore me .
i'll i'll just sit here quiet as a lamb until you're done .
so evie said something about business . hmm?
what? oh , yes . um , michael tells me you want to close the play . my husband's a devious little runt .
oh , that's unfair . he was perfectly right to consult me . we're partners . the 3 of us . a perfect combination . my money , his know how , your genius .
i'm exhausted , dolly .
i feel twice my age which makes me 90 .
i'm bored . life has nothing in store for me . you mean that or are you acting?
i never know when you're acting .
i'm not acting .
i'm near to having a breakdown .
i feel as though my life's come to an end . all right . all right . all done . oh , thank you , you're a dear .
uh . are you really near a breakdown , julia?
oh , i don't know .
i don't know .
i'm in such an odd state at the moment .
it's as if ... it's as if the curtain's come down on act 1 , but i have no idea what happens in act 2 .
i i'm in a sort of limbo . waiting for something to happen . but what?
what? oh , please , dolly , be my friend .
oh . make michael take the play off .
i need a holiday .
i could visit visit my mother in jersey , and then visit you in france . oh .
i could swim in your pool . in the nuddy .
lovely flowers for someone .
oh , hello , a blooming florist's shop .
who sent them?
mrs. de vries? very likely . or lord tamerley . here , don't forget , you've got dinner with him after the show tonight . yes , i know . expect you'll have to turn on the waterworks for him again as per usual .
i wish you'd teach me to cry real tears . the times i've needed them .
oh , here's a card .
from mr. thomas fennel , tavistock square . what a place to live . who the hell do you suppose he is , evie? oh , some feller knocked all of a heap by your fatal beauty , i expect . probably cost a fortune . went without dinner for a week . oh , pull the other one .
beginners , please , miss lambert . mmm hmm . well , whoever mr. thomas fennel is ,
i think it's all right having a young man send me flowers at my time of life .
i mean , it just shows you how do you know he's a young man? he's probably over 80 .
go to hell .
i'm on my way i'm on my way
i'm busy 'cause i'm on my way [ people applauding ]
thank you . thank you .
julia lambert .
the champagne now , my lord? thank you , antoine . and for you , madame lambert?
i'd prefer beer but i mustn't , so i'll make do with bubbly . thank you .
oh . it's a portrait of clairon . she was a great actress , and i believe you have many of her gifts .
charles , you are sweet .
i thought you might like it .
it's by way of being a parting present . you're going away? no . but i shan't be seeing you anymore . oh , charles , not again .
no . this is becoming a ritual . why? we have such a beautiful friendship , julia . it's unique in my experience , but people talk .
they don't understand . and even though we know the truth , if we go on seeing one another , there will be a terrible scandal . no , there won't .
michael and i lead separate lives . that's why we're so happily married . more or less . jumped up little tart , that's what she is .
never stops acting , on stage or off . she's just one big pose . dashed pretty . shut up , rupert , don't show your ignorance .
i know all about her . we were both born in the channel islands , jersey . her father was our doctor . a jersey doctor !
you can't get more common than that .
it's only common sense , darling .
i don't want to lose you .
i i have few friends . real friends .
you're the only person in my life with whom i can be entirely myself .
i'm terribly low at the moment .
i i need you .
let's go on seeing each other . please . uh , please forgive us intruding like this , miss lambert .
my friend and i are such very great admirers . and i wonder ... do you remember me?
florence coltraine , isn't it?
rupert and i want you to settle an argument .
i think i used to know your father in jersey .
he was a doctor , wasn't he? he used to come to our house quite often . actually , he was a vet . he used to go to your house to deliver the bitches . the house was full of them .
life is just a bowl of cherries don't take it serious life's too mysterious you work , you save you worry so but you can't take your dough when you go
i'm sorry , i didn't mean to frighten you . t o m .
you remember . did you like the the flowers? oh , mr. thomas fennel , tavistock square .
yes , of course , thank you . well , uh , i couldn't decide between a single rose and every flower in the store . is that why you're here at this time of night? to find out if i received the flowers? no . you see , i don't have a phone yet .
i don't see why not . will you really? how about next friday?
138 tavistock square , 4 : 30?
all right .
i'll be there . gee , that's swell . see you then . the sweet things in life to you were just loaned so how gonna you lose what you've never owned?
life is just a bowl of cherries
oh?
i saw you drive up .
i'm afraid i'm on the 3rd floor .
i hope you don't mind . and if i do?
we're there . thank god for that .
the gas ring's in the bathroom . oh . it isn't the ritz , but it's home . no , it's it's charming . it's so london . it reminds me of my early days .
i have to put coins in the gas meter . oh , yes , so did i.
have some cake .
i bought it specially . oh .
i shouldn't , but i will .
you know something? you ought to be in movies . real actresses don't make films .
but beautiful actresses do . hmm . well , i saw you in nobody's perfect on broadway .
i was 14 at the time .
i wish you hadn't told me that .
i stood outside the stage door and , uh , i got your autograph . you asked me my name .
i told you . you knew how to spell it then .
what's so funny?
you remind me of something . what is it?
my husband . in a scene we had to play .
he didn't know how to sit down .
jimmie made him do it over and over again .
uh , i can't stay long .
i must have a nap before my performance . but you've only just arrived . and you you can't go without , uh , without , well , seeing the view . it's really great . if you just come over to the window ...
isn't it terrific?
i just love london . it's so big , but it's also kind of friendly . and all those people , each with their own lives .
i can't explain it . when i first came to london , i stood in piccadilly circus
looking at the lights and the people and the taxis , and i said out loud : " one day i'm going to conquer you . " and you have . have i?
i wonder
look at my hair .
uh , here . oh? thank you .
and i thought you were such a shy young man .
when am i when am i gonna see you again?
you want to see me again?
what do you think?
i'll ring you up one of these days . uh , my hat ... oh , uh ... good . well , uh , i have a phone now . and the number's museum 4516 . so promise you'll call soon . on my honor .
i can see myself out .
for christ's sake , julia , what do you think you're doing? you're supposed to be playing a whore , not a schoolgirl with a crush on her gym mistress . you kissed him as if you were frightened of catching his cold . when you kiss , you should feel as if your bones are melting inside your body . tongues , darling , that's what it's about , tongues . now , i know you're a virgin . don't give me the waterworks , julia , i'm too old for that . you're a virgin , so what you have to do is find a handsome young man ,
like your juvenile man , michael gosselyn . go back to your rooms , take your clothes off , lie on the bed , open your legs and ask him to give it to you hot , sweet and strong . if that doesn't improve your acting , then nothing will . right , let's do it again .
what's so funny?
i feel as though i'm a 2 year old .
that's 88 years you've lost in a week .
tell us the secret , we'll bottle it and make a fortune .
hmm .
damn it all , miss lambert , you don't look so bad .
you can go on playing 25 year olds ,
30 year olds for a good long time yet .
and then what? whoo ! mothers , grandmothers and old maids .
bugger playwrights . can't write for women . they're all men , that's the trouble .
yes? good morning .
t o m . you promised to call me .
give a girl a chance .
when am i going to see you again? as soon as i have a moment to spare . come to tea after the matinee .
oh , i'm not falling for that one again . how about dinner after the show then?
if you insist .
i do .
on the silver screen he melts her foolish heart in every single scene although she's quite aware that here and there are traces of the cad about the boy
lord knows she's not a fool girl
she really shouldn't care
lord knows she's not a school girl in the flurry of her first affair
will it ever cloy this odd diversity of misery and joy i told them
look , there's lord crumley over there . and i think that's lady laweston . what have you been reading , debrett's?
debrett's? no , the tatler .
oh , you have to know who's who to get on in this town . oh , you want to get on , do you?
i want to get on you , julia . don't be disgusting . but i want you .
i do .
you're the loveliest girl that one
i want you .
your conversation's frightfully limited , tom .
dance with me . what time is it? oh , well , uh , i ...
i forgot to put on my watch .
have you pawned it? no , no , i just , uh ,
i i dressed in rather a hurry tonight .
they'll never believe me they'll never believe me that from this great big world you've chosen
he treated you like a tart . which of course is what you are .
he was my earth , my moon ,
and all the stars in the firmament .
farewell , my love .
you were wonderful tonight , my darling .
bloody marvelous . you almost made me cry . only almost?
i'll kill whoever set the photo . thanks , archie . and what've you done to your eyes? hmm? some new makeup?
i've never seen them shine like that before . your call , mr. dexter . hmm .
sorry about the photo , it won't happen again . hmm . your call , miss lambert . you're forgiven .
what's the matter with her?
darling , julia .
you were quite wonderful tonight .
i'll say . absolutely first rate . thank you . yes , i believe i was firing on all cylinders . and i'm starving , absolutely ravenous .
evie , what have we got for supper tonight? tripe and onions . oh , how divine .
i adore tripe and onions .
michael , michael , if you love me , if you've got any spark of tenderness in that hard heart of yours ,
let me have a bottle of beer . beer? yes .
julia . just this once . oh , evie , that's for you . uh , please?
julia , i think it's a damn shame .
what is? well , that you're taking the play off . the good news is ,
i've found an italian company who wants the theatre for 3 months , so i said they could have it . hmm . mmm .
i'm sure your mother's as excited as i am at the thought of being with you . we'll have such fun at my place , julia . you could do anything you like . rest . anything .
i've changed my mind .
i don't know why , but i'm beginning to enjoy myself again . oh , but
let's run through the summer and then find something new for the autumn . but i've ...
i i've ...
i've told the italians . then un tell them . and i was so looking forward to france . stars will be stars .
i forgot . what? hmm ...
oh , my god . a cartier . well spotted . when's your birthday?
november 20 . hmm . happy birthday . uh , but it's not november 20 . don't be so pedantic . open it .
oh , that's the one thing i've wanted my whole life .
thank you .
uh , geez , it's lousy
i can't give you anything in return . give me that watch you pawned to buy me supper . have you redeemed it yet? ah ! thanks .
it'll amuse me to wear it .
i love you , julia .
this is total insanity .
i'm old enough to be ...
god , i'm a fool ,
i'm such a bloody fool .
good morning , evie . where's my wife? in your study . my study? mmm hmm . what's she doing there? exercising .
exercising?
what are you doing? swimming the channel , what do you think i'm doing?
yeah , but why?
miss phillips said my tummy needed tightening , so i'm tightening it .
oh .
oh , yes , i had a thought . we should take a country house for the summer . what do you think?
i'll talk to you later .
so do you think a house for the summer's a good idea?
yes . golf , swimming , tennis . it'll be especially good for roger . he loves golf . then he'll have to decide what's he gonna do with his life .
i think he should go to university . he doesn't want to , and we shouldn't insist . it's his life . oh , yes , i had another idea . you remember that young chap i introduced you to? which young chap? that american . good looking fellow . remember?
american , you must remember . vaguely . well , he's frightfully good at his job . he's a wizard with money .
lots of american ideas for avoiding tax .
what about him? well , i thought we might invite him down for a couple of weeks to spend his holiday with us .
why would we want to do that? he'll be company for roger . he's only a bit older .
roger will like him , i'm sure of it . shall i ask him? hmm . ah !
remind me to keep exercising .
so , will you come and stay?
michael says the house is frightfully comfortable . probably not .
i'm going abroad for a couple of months .
what fun . well , you'll be busy , won't you?
looking for a new play , reading scripts .
so , what do you think? he hasn't done justice to your eyes .
as a matter of fact , there is a play that interests me . it's about an older woman who has an affair with a younger man . oh , a farce . why do you say that? well , because everyone laughs at the older woman . no , not in this play . it's all serious .
the act 1 curtain's good . it comes as a shock to her . what does? that she's fallen in love with the boy .
and it happens just when everything seemed to her so dull and unpromising , as if her life was over . she finds the affair exhilarating . and everyone keeps telling her she looks 10 years younger .
i trust she doesn't confess to the boy that she loves him . that's always fatal .
does it sound like something for me? oh , don't be ridiculous , julia .
no , your public would never stand for it . if such a woman asked me ,
i know what advice i'd give her . what? break it off at once . it will only end in tears . but , charles , she can't do that . why ever not? because she's fallen in love with him , that's why . she's helpless . hmm .
the character in the play .
dolly , old thing , how are you?
i haven't seen you for ages .
sit down and make yourself , uh , comfy . so , come to see that the old firm's raking in the dividends for you?
michael , i'll come straight to the point . you know i'm not one to gossip , but but i'm upset about julia .
i think you ought to know that people are beginning to talk . what the devil do you mean? well , it's absurd that at her age , she should make herself so conspicuous with a young boy . oh , you mean tom fennel? don't be such a fool , dolly .
i'm not a fool . when someone is as well known as julia and they're always seen with the same man , naturally people talk . tom fennel is a very good type of american . he's clean , honest and by way of being a gentleman . he's boring , dull , common and a snob .
he's just using julia . he's a little gold digger .
can you look me in the eyes , dolly , and tell me you really think
julia's having an affair with him?
no . ah . the truth is , michael , i've hardly seen her . she never telephones anymore , and ... and ...
i understand , dolly , believe me .
she's very fond of you , you know that , but she's bound to have other friends .
i don't think chaps should talk about their wives to others .
i think it's frightfully bad form but let me explain something to you about julia . sex doesn't mean a thing to her . it was different in the beginning . then she could be somewhat tiresome sometimes .
but after she had roger , she changed . having a baby seemed to settle her . all those instincts went into her acting , you see . gossip isn't good for business , michael .
i mean , if julia had one flagrant affair after another , nobody would notice but but this boy , he's half her age . the public has always looked up to you as such a devoted and loyal couple . and so we are , damn it . in our way . devoted , united , but not ... how shall i put it? not possessive .
we're a very modern couple .
hello , roger , my boy . hello , daddy . glad to be finished at eton? no mummy? no , it's saturday . she's got 2 shows .
3 and 4 pence , sir . she'll be down first thing in the morning . thank you so much . thank you , sir . here , let me give you a hand . she's bringing a young chap down with her , your age more or less . a yank .
i think you'll like him .
i get no kick from champagne mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all so tell me why should it be true that i get a kick out of you [ sighing ] what's the matter? nothing . tell me . it's ...
i i i just don't ...
i'm worried sick , that's all . what about? tell me , tom . what? it's money , i owe money . oh . is that all?
i thought it was something serious . well , it's ok for you , julia , but i just can't afford all the things we do . nightclubs , restaurants . sweetheart . how can you let a trifle like that upset you? don't worry about it .
i'll give you the money . no , i i couldn't take any money from you . what nonsense . why grudge me the happiness it gives me to get you out of a hole?
i get a kick out of you
i thought tonight we might play mahjong . do you play mahjong , tom? no , i sorry , um , no can do . we're going down to the pub to assess the local talent .
oh , i might come with you . the barmaid is an absolute stunner .
god , you're all so vulgar . well , mummy , you have an early night . it'll do you good . you're looking awfully fagged .
more wine?

i'm going to get you back .
you're an uncivilized oaf .
and you're running away .
come on , michael , you promised me a dance .
so i did , sorry .
i might be out of practice .
answer my question , julia .
what question? would you? would i what? tour in the second mrs. tanqueray for 17 pounds a week . and it's a 6 month tour , darling .
6 months . no , i can't be away from home for 6 months . what would archie do without me?
oh , he'll think of something .
mmm . they're so bloody mean , these managements .
i said , " give me 18 pounds and i'll do it . " and he said , " 18 pounds?
18 pounds ! " cheeky little sod .
what are you doing tonight?
i don't know . do you know that girl's name? which girl? oh , that's avice crichton .
you couldn't have her for 80 pounds , never mind 18 pounds .
i thought that was witty . don't you think that was witty? hilarious . well , they're not number one dates , darling . oh , not at all .
lowestoft , bournemouth and chesterfield and christ knows where else .
6 months ... mummy , we're going to london to have supper and do the clubs , all right?
no . no , really not , you've all had too much to drink . tom hasn't . he's driving , and one of the girls has a car .
yeah . yeah , we had a great time
good night , old man . good night , pal .
are you are you crazy , what do you think you're you doing?
i was about to ask you the same thing . go back to your room .
i've hardly seen you since you've been here . you've seen roger more than me . we haven't been alone . what's wrong with you? you haven't held me , you haven't kissed me . shh .
avice crichton certainly looks like one .
i'm going back to london tomorrow . good .
i hope you remember to tip the servants or do you want me to give you the money , hmm?
these are yours , take them back . don't be such a bloody little fool . you think i like being a kept boy? you think i like being humiliated like this , huh?
i'm sorry , i'm sorry .
i'm sorry .
i didn't mean it . that makes it even worse .
i should never have let you give me these presents .
i should never have let you lend me that money . by the end of the month i'll pay you back .
i've apologized . don't go to london tomorrow , please .
i love you , tom .
please .
i'm tired .
i want to go to bed now .
now , that's the real thing , julia , or my name's not jimmie langton . but i've got some notes . you're still going over the top . you've got to learn restraint .
and for christ's sake , stop crying , will you? we all know you can turn your tears on and off like a tap , so turn them off , will you?
well , bugger me , you really are crying this time , aren't you?
i can't say i wasn't moved , but you've got to learn to do it so that it seems real . seems to be real , that's the art of acting . hold the mirror up to nature , ducky , otherwise you'll become a nervous wreck , take to drink and end up a piss artist playing gin sodden whores all over scotland on number 3 tours . technique , that's what i want you to learn . technique .
i saw the light on . can i come in? yes , of course . is something wrong?
no . you've been crying . no , no , just a bad dream .
what is it , sweetheart?
we picked up a couple of girls tonight .
who did? tom and me .
oh . tom made me promise i wouldn't tell you . he said you'd be furious .
were they tarts? no , they're on the stage .
joan asked me if i could get her an understudy in your next play . yes , tarts .
i just had to tell you .
tell me what?
i thought it was about time
i found out what it was all about .
roger , what do you mean?
love .
love?
it's not that great , really .
i don't know why everybody makes such a fuss about it .
mummy , what's the matter?
you are upset . why are you crying? oh , because you're such a little boy .
don't cry . hmm .
i needed to tell you . it had to happen sooner or later . it makes me feel so old .
age cannot wither her , nor custom stale her infinite variety " if i'd been cleopatra ,
i'd have put whoever said that to death .
to tell you the truth , i didn't enjoy it much .
oh , you're so very , very young .
i'll grow out of it . hmm .
i may go abroad for a while . oh , where?
i don't know .
italy , france . abroad .
i say , about about that under study , is there any chance for joan? tell her to write to me .
thanks . good night . good night , darling .
an understudy , my foot .
wait . hold it .
it's from you know who .
i don't want to be disturbed .
good matinee? all right , but i'm not feeling very well . draw up a chair . sit down .
what's the matter? nothing .
i haven't been sleeping .
i had a post card from roger . he's in naples . says he's having a great time . yes , but you haven't come here just to tell me that , have you? no , it's something else .
i , uh ...
i can't pay you back the money that i owe you .
i know i said at the end of last month . but i just don't have it .
i could pay it off .
i hate having to ask for more time . but ... don't be such a bloody little idiot , tom .
it's so humiliating , julia . geez , when you said you'd pay my tips for me , how do you think that made me feel?
i said i'm sorry , i didn't mean it .
i was jealous of you spending so much time with roger .
i was jealous .
i was jealous of you going out and having a good time without me . is that so horrible?
i should never have accepted anything from you .
you're everything in the world to me . you know that .
i love being with you .
i don't want to lose you .
i have few friends . real friends .
and you're the only person in my life with whom i can be entirely myself .
let's ... let's go ...
let's go on seeing each other . please .
oh , julia .
well , i've always said , you're lucky you can cry without your eyelids swelling .
go to hell . well , you're looking a lot happier ,
i'll say that for you .
i hope with good reason . if you're thinking what i think you're thinking , then stop thinking . all the same , evie , you know what i think? no , what do you think? what mugs men are . well , they can't keep it in their trousers ,
yes , i am happier . everything will be all right now .
i can't help feeling ...
i wish i didn't . deep down , i can't help feeling ... what? a certain contempt for that boy .
he's so transparent .
life is just a bowl of cherries don't make it serious life's too mysterious you work , you save , you worry so but you can't take your dough
