she's found us .
and i thought it was just to hurt aidan , but it's more than that .
she wants to be him .
and she wants to live for real this time .
you tell me , who can help me?
who?
i'm sure there's a rational ...
you take his picture and tell me why she's in it .
rachel .
you take his picture .
it's proof that he's what?
he's got a ghost inside him?
no .
the proof is what will happen .
aidan , you said samara couldn't hear us when we sleep .
well , you're sleeping now .
tell me how to stop her , honey .
tell me how to help you .
just tell me , i'll do anything , i swear .
ms. keller?
hello , i'm dr. emma temple .
i'm a consulting physician at county child services .
well , i was hoping to speak with aidan when he wakes up .
is everything all right in here?
yeah .
it's fine .
thank you .
i was hoping to speak with you as well .
it's rachel , isn't it?
yeah , about his situation .
i'm sorry , what kind of doctor did you say you were again?
i'm a psychiatrist .
yeah .
i spoke with a dr ... ... koji in seattle .
aidars doctor .
look , if we could maybe talk later .
right .
dr. koji mentioned that you dealt with some ppd when aidan was born .
postpartum depression .
that was the first month .
that's all .
i understand .
it's very common .
i mean , a lot of women have trouble adapting to the stresses of motherhood .
what does this have to do with what's going on with my son right now?
have you been under stress lately?
have you ever found that you were ... ... unable to experience love for aidan?
what?
have you hurt him , however unintentionally?
have you left him alone?
abandoned him?
i'd like to be with my son , please , if you don't mind .
yeah , of course .
i'm sorry , rachel .
until we can talk further , i cannot let you be alone with him .
i'm his mother .
there are bruises on his body .
he was hypothermic and very near death .
that is not because of me .
he's gonna be all right , rachel .
he will .
but you need to leave .
now , please .
you can't have him , samara .
you're going back to where you came from .
we'll talk in here .
it really will help .
sharing one's troubles never hurt anybody .
now , are you a coffee drinker?
black .
yeah , i imagined so .
dr. forrest , dial 118 , please .
dr. forrest , please dial 118 .
let's call the doctor in seattle .
i want to know just how bad her postpartum got .
yes .
thank you .
the mother is missing .
i want a watch on this room .
she returns , she is not allowed in .
okay , dr. temple .
all i wanna know is her history before the morgans .
i'm sorry , but the privacy laws still apply .
well , was she really adopted?
can you at least tell me that much?
was their story true?
samara morgan was adopted , yes .
but you won't tell me from who?
i'd lose my job if i did .
look , ma'am , my son has a medical condition that his doctors don't even understand .
this little girl had the same condition .
now , if i knew what caused that , it could save his life .
all i can say is you should speak to the morgans .
they're dead .
they both killed themselves .
whoa !
look out .
early birds .
marty savide , stevens northwest realty .
hi .
come in .
i thought i put 12 : 30 on the ad .
for the open house .
how'd you get around the gate?
well , i just ...
who cares?
come on .
make me an offer over asking and it's yours .
okay , then , don't mind me .
my first try with these things , took off flying .
there we go .
what do you think?
a little color will really turn the place around .
it's got a wonderful history .
working horse ranch .
how about that?
and there's even this cute little tree house thing way up in the barn .
is the place being sold unfurnished or ...?
the previous owners didn't leave anything behind?
well , there were some things that were left , after they ... ... moved .
we're storing that in the basement .
there's a basement?
well , you betcha .
no extra charge .
right this way .
if you don't mind , i'm the welcome wagon .
gotta open up the gate for everyone else .
so please , make yourself at home .
do you know what happened to them?
the previous owners?
i believe they bought a condo in phoenix .
really?
her mother .
oh , my .
you're awake .
i'll take it from here .
hello , aidan , i'm dr. temple .
how are you feeling?
you know , i'd really like to help you .
can you tell me how you're feeling?
where's my mommy?
well , she'll be here soon .
she's on her way .
i want mommy .
yeah , i know you do .
your mommy wants to be with you too .
so where is she?
she went home .
she didn't think that you were gonna wake up so soon .
i wanna go home too .
well , you will .
we just have to ...
we just have to get you ...
you're freezing .
i wanna go home to mommy .
well , we need to talk about her .
can you tell me about mommy a little bit?
she loves me .
i know that she does .
she went looking for me .
she tried to find me .
it means she loves me .
i don't understand .
can i go home now?
no , honey , you're not well enough .
can i go home?
no .
i'm sorry .
then i have to show you something .
it won't stop .
i'm gonna walk you just around the corner here .
hi , i'm sister diane .
how can we help you?
i need to know about a child who was born here .
is there anyone that can talk to me who's been here more than 30 years?
please , come in .
thank you .
i remember this , yes .
a young girl made it .
sixteen .
she was shy , quiet ... ... beautiful .
she stayed here?
yes .
did she have her baby here?
yes .
and you arranged for the adoption?
that's right .
who was she?
she was picked up wandering the streets and brought to us .
she was from some little town up in the mountains .
she said she'd been sent away to live with relatives in the city .
but no relatives were ever found .
her name was evelyn .
she came to us eight months pregnant .
and the father?
there was none .
half the mothers that come to us say that .
so , what did she think got her pregnant?
she wasrt well .
hallucinations , visions .
she believed some thing had come for her baby from the waters of the world beyond this one .
i'm sorry .
did you say water?
well , we all envision the afterlife differently .
for evelyn , it's just what she believed .
as you might imagine , she suffered severe postpartum depression .
she blamed her troubles on her child .
so she tried to kill it .
all babies are a challenge .
but samara , she never cried .
never .
except when her mother would try to bathe her .
then she'd scream like it was the end of the world .
it was the screaming that woke us .
evelyn , don't !
evelyn !
evelyn , stop !
she was trying to drown the baby .
the baby was taken from her , of course .
evelyn was institutionalized .
and all those pictures she'd been collecting , they finally made sense .
did she say why she did it?
she felt she had to kill her baby to save it .
i'm here to see a patient .
her name's evelyn .
i don't know her last name .
evelyn?
that's right .
evelyrs expecting you .
every few years , one of you comes to see evelyn .
she's like a freakir patron saint or something .
got a problem with your kid , don't you?
something wrong?
that song .
i know it .
yeah .
they all do .
hey , evelyn .
you were right as rain .
you got a visitor today .
hope she's some help to your troubles .
ten minutes .
my name's rachel .
but you know that .
some days i sort of have a feeling .
a feeling?
this is about your child .
it's ...
it's about yours .
samara .
they don't dream , you know .
the dead don't dream .
look , something's happened to my son .
you have to sleep to dream .
it has to do with your daughter .
and the dead never sleep .
they wait ... ... and watch for a way back .
but they never sleep .
that's why dreams are safe .
i'm sorry , i just ...
i don't have a lot of time .
please , i need your help .
i have to know .
can you tell me?
why did you try to kill your baby?
why?
because my baby told me to .
just like yours will tell you .
and you have to do it .
you have to send it back .
what?
they stopped me .
don't let them stop you .
what?
listen to the voices .
what are you talking about?
because it's our fault .
we did it .
yes .
we did it .
yes .
it was you .
it was you !
you did it !
what did i do?
evelyn , that's enough .
i love my son .
come on .
it's all right .
i'm sorry , ma'am , that's enough for today .
let's go .
what did i do?
you let the dead get in .
let's go .
what should i do?
be a good mother .
listen to your baby .
listen to your baby .
listen to your baby .

why don't you do something productive with your life?
say , billy , if you like fish so much ...
your mom loves you , you know .
she loves you a lot .
you'd tell someone if you werert sure about that , right?
like , if she'd been hurting you somehow .
did she ever treat you like you're someone else?
i'm not somebody else .
i'm aidan .
no , i know .

we don't need anyone else .
that's right .
we don't need you , that doctor or anyone else .
okay?
