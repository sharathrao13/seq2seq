mathematicians won the war .
mathematicians broke the japanese's codes and built the atom bomb .
mathematicians ... like you .
the stated goal of the soviets is the global communists .
the medicine or economics .
ln techonology or space .
battlelines are being drawn .
to try on , we need results .
publishable , applicable results .
now who among you would be the next morse ... the einstien .
who among you would be the van gogh of democracy , freedom ...
today we bequeath the americans future into your able hands .
welcome to princeton , gentlemen .
ls not enough that hansen won the conesky scholarship?
no , he has it all for himself .
this is the first time the carniment prize hasn't been split .
he has got his sight set on wheeler lab . the new military think that he could done it in mlt .
they are only taking one this year .
hansen used to be pick first .
he is wasted on that .
he should be running for president ...
that could be a mathematic .
i bet your tie is .
thank you .
nelson , symbol creeptography .
nel's here broke the jap code .
help with the world efficient .
these are what he tells the girls things .
my name is bender , atomic physics .
and you are ...
am i late?
yes , mr sow .
hi , sow .
richard sow .
ahh ... the burden of genius .
there he is .
so many supplicants in so little time , mr sow
bender ...
congratulations , mr hansen .
thank you .
i'll take another .
excuse me .
i seem presume you are the waiter .
play nice , hansen .

i have read your preference .
both of them .
one on the nazish assignment .
and one on the non mainly occasion .

i have chip on bowl sold .
maybe you're just battle with the integers anywhile with people .
my first teacher , she told me i was born with two helping brains but only half of a helping heart .
wow ... she sounds lovely .
but the truth is i don't like people much .
and they don't much like me .
but why?
we are abvious width and charming .
seriously , john .
mathematics ...
mathematics is not going to lead you to higher truth .
and you know why?
because it is boring .
don't you believe?
now have the school boys to all the publish .
i cannot waste time with these classes and these books .
memorize in wicked sums of less immortal .
i need to look through to the governance .
find the truly original idea .
and see the only way i distinguish myself .
it's the only way i ...
math it .
yes ...
no ...
i hate this thing .
cowards !
all of you !
none of you rise to me much chance .
come on , bender .
who ever wins , sow does his laundry , all semester .
anyone else?
not at all .
look at him
nash , taking your reverse constitutional?
i'm hoping to extract them to define their movement .
so cool .
nash , i thought you drive out .
you haven't got a class or ...
classes will dull your mind
destroy the potential for creative .
oh , i didn't know that .
nash is going to stun us all with his genius .
it's just another way of saying doesn't have the nerve to compete .
are you scared?
terrify , modify , petrify .
stupidfy by you .
no starch .
press and folded .
may i ask you something , john?

how it could work , without innovation .
i'm flatter .
are you flatter?
flatter .
and i've got two weapons briefs under secured of you by the d. o. d.
vanish achievements , zero .
i'm a patient person , martin .
when is the next question coming?
what if you never come up with your original idea , huh?
lf i were you , i would have chosen the wheeler .
and you are not .
what if you lose?
you should not have won .
i had the first move on .
my play was perfect .
the hubris are the defeated .
the game is float .
gentlemen , the great john nash .
you've been in here for two days .
you know hansen is published for another paper?
i came for the top of my doctor .
well , on the bright side , you have invented the window art .
this is the group thing touch for all .
this is the plaster of pigeons fighting for bread .
and this here is chasing a man who stole a purse .
john , you watch the marking .
that is weird .
and compare to beavers , some of us are always losers .
my niece , she challege .
she is about this high .
lf i don't have any clue to liberate , or prefences to announcing , or no body loses .

hang there .
hey , nash .
nel is trying to get your attention .
oh no ...
go with god .
come back here , man .
unfortune the favours is the braves .
bombs away .
john , you are the mathemathically , successful man ever .
this is going to be the classic .
maybe you want to buy me a drink .
i don't exactly know what i'm require to say in order to let you happen to course with me .
but could we assume that i was a little ...
i am a bit sensible to talk about photo exchange , right?
so could we go straight to the sex?
that would be sweet .
have a nice night , asshole .
i ...
i assume that you like a liitle bit about photo exchange .
that was pretty charming .
walk with me , john .
i'll have a minute to talk with you .
the faculty has completely meet your reviews .
we decide that which application is just a plot .
sir , that would be my first choose , i won't think a second choice ...
john ... your fellows have attended classes, they are writing in the papers .
oh ...
i am still searching , sir .
the original idea , yeah .
that is very clever , john .
but i suppose that is not enough .
my begging is try to show some promise .
lf you could just arrange another meeting if you be kind off ...
professor einstein , i would be complete if ...
no , john .
i'm willing to show them .
my efficient is ...
john !
john !
do you see what are they doing in there?
it's the pens .
reserve for the member of department who make the achievement for the life time .
now what do you see , john?
well , try seeing an accomplishment .
ls there a difference?
john , you haven't focus .
i'm sorry .
but after these point , your record doesn't won any placement at all .
good day .
i can't see it ....
jesus christ , john .
i can't fail .
this is all i have .
come on .
let's go out .
john ...
john , that's enough .
does't mess that out .
come on .
go bust your head .
do it .
go bust your head .
damn it , charles .
what is your problem?
it is not my problem .
and it is not your problem .
it is their problem .
your answer ... isn't face the wall .
it is out there .
what you have being working .
it is heavy .
that icy fellow is right ...
there is something ... that we can't weight .
don't worry .
it is mine .
lncoming , gentlemen .
nash , can you stop answering your papers for 5 seconds?
i will not buy you gentlemen beer .
we are not here for beer , my friend .
now i feel a bit slow motion .
would she want a large wedding?
have you remember of nothing?
we call the lessons of adam smith .
father of modern economics .
ln competition . lndividuals and vision serve the common good .
exactly .
every man for himself , gentlemen .
those who strike out would step with their friends .
i am not going to strike out .
you can lead the blonde water but you can't make a drink .
no body move .
she is looking over here .
she is looking at nash .
oh , god .
i did't have the abraham awakes until he opens his mouth .
adam smith needs for pigeon .
what are you talking about?
for all of you who go for the blonde .
they block each other .
not a single one of us could get her .
so we go to her friends .
but they will all give us a cold shouder , cause no body like to be a second choice .
no one goes to the blonde .
we don't get each others way .
and we don't insult the other girls .
and so we'll win .
that's the only way we all get laid .
adam smith said the best result comes ... from everyone in the group doing what is best for himself .
right? ls that what he said?
lncompleted ...
because the best result would come ... of every one in the group doing what is best for himself ... and the group .
nash , this is some way that you get the blonde on your own .
you can go to hell .
adam smith is wrong .
here we go ...
becareful ...
thank you .
you do realize that this flies over the face of economics over 1 50 years?
yes .
i do , sir .
that is rather presumptuous , don't you think?
yes , sir .
well , mr nash , with the breakthrough of this magnitude ,
i'm confident that you can get any placement that you like .
wheeler's lab will ask you to recommend two team members .
still in fact got excellent choices .
sow and bender , sir .
sow and bender ...
extraordinary mathematicians .
sow and bender , they might have the plans of their own .
you have made it .
odd moment , gentlemen .
governing dynamics ..
congratulations , john ...
general , athletics won't allow us in here .
dr nash , your coat .
thank you , sir .
doctor .
general , this is the wheeler teamleader , dr john nash .
i'm glad you could come , doctor .
hello .
right this way .
we've been inaccepting radio transmission from moscow .
computer can't detect the pattern but i'm sure it is code .
have you just know something , dr nash?
constantly .
we develop several safers , if you like to review our preliminary data .
doctor?
8494 ...
i need a map .
46 . 1 3 . 0 . 8 . 57 . 46 . 90 .
starts at the corne . r .
48 . 30 . 1 . 91 . 26 . 35 .
prairie portage , minnesota .

they're at least 1 0 of others .
they're plotting to across the borders and come into u. s.
extraordinary .
gentlemen , we need a move on this .
who's that big brother?
you give your country a great savor , son .
captain .
yes , sir .
accompany dr nash .
what about the russian's move , general?
captain roger will restore you to a unrestricted area , doctor .
thank you .
dr nash , follow me please .
a moment in the pentagon , huh?
they usually take the word " classified " out of the dictionary .
the air condition broke again .
how am i going to safe the world if i am melt?
you know , two trip to the pentagon in 4 years .
it gets better , john .
sign here since it is relating to the assignment .
you know , the russian has the aged bomb .
and nasa is repaying south america .
chinese has outstanding army of 2 . 8 million .
i am doing stress test on a damn .
hey , look .
you make the cover of the fortune again .
please do not use the word " you " , not " we " .
that was supposed to be just me .
so not only they rob me in the field , now they put me on the fortune's magazine with these hats , the scholars of tribia .
what's the difference between genius and most genius?
quite a lot .
his your son .
you got 1 0 minutes .
i always got 1 0 minutes .
before a new class .
can i not getting a " no " for a doctor or something?
you are a doctor , john .
and no .
never mind .
you are the drill and we give beautiful facilities .
mlt got a lot of great answers for tomorrow .
have a nice day at school .
you'll get young minds tomorrow .
can we open one , professor?
it's really hot , sir .
your comfort comes to my second ability to get mourn .
personally , i think this class would be a waste of yours , and what is infinitely worse my time .
however , here we are , so ...
you may attend or not , you may complete your assignment , we have to go .
miss !
excuse me !
hi !
we have a little problem .
it's extremely hot with the window close , and extremely noisy with them open .
so i was wondering if there is anyway you could maybe work some place else for about 45 minutes .
no problem .
thank you so much .
as you will find they will be multiply severals calculative up , and a number of solutions to get in problem .
as i was saying , this problem have will take some of you many months to solve .
and the others among you , take you to determine in the natural lifes .
professor nash .
william patcher .
big brother ... of natural service .
what can i do for the department of defense?
are you getting me raise?
let's take a walk .
lmpressive work at the pentagon .
yes , it was .
i used to see genius see the answer before the question .
this project was under my supervision .
which project?
that project .
it's not that simple , you know .
were you under the war?
we incinerate it .
1 50, 000 in a heart beat .
great dids come with great cost , mr patcher .
conviction turn out as the luxuries for those in the sideline
i'll try keep that in mind .
so , john .
no family , no close friends .
why is that?
i like to think because i'm alone wolf .
but mainly is because people don't like me .
well , there are certain reason that you're lack of connection with people would be consider as an advantange .
this is secured .
they know me .
do you ever been here?
i was told this warehouse is abandoned .
that's not precisely accurate .
lf i'm telling you what i'm about to tell you ,
i'm increasing your clearance to top secret .
disclose your up secured information result an imprisonment .
you get it?
part of operation .
that's a good idea .
this factory is in berlin .
we ceased it at the end of the war .
nasty engineers were intended to build portable atomic bomb .
the soviets reached this facility before we didn't .
we lost the damn thing .
they are running orders in the pentagon .
they are about this , aren't they?
the soviets are unify as people believe .
the new freedom has controlled the bomb and intense to dead netted in the u. s. soil .
their plan is to increase maximum casualties .
it has much capable than imagination .
new freedom has slippery agents here in the u. s.
mcculty isn't an idiot .
unfortunately that doesn't make him wrong .
new freedom communicates to it's agents send codes to the newspapers and magazine .
that's why you come in .
you see , john ...
what distinguish you?
ls that you are quite simply the best code breaker i ever seen .
what exactly is it that you would like me to do?
commit these articles to memory .
scan each new issue , find the hidden code and decide for them .
you will feel a bit uncomfortable .
that's got a little zap to it isn't it?
you just implant the radium .
don't worry .
it is safe .
the isotope decays predictably .
as a result , these numbers change over time .
they are the access code to your jobs .
so what am i now?
a little spy?
it must be really important .
it's alright , mike .
what are you working on?
classified .
everyone waited half an hour .
for?
class .
you miss class today .
well , i suspected ... nobody miss me .
the problem that you left on the board ...
i solve it .
oh no , you didn't .
you don't even look .
i never said that the rest in the field are rational functions .
the solution is elegant .
go on with this particular occasion .
all of them are correct .
you're still here .
i'm still here .
i'm wondering , professor nash ...
lf i can ask you for dinner .
you do eat , don't you?
occasionally ... yeah .
for me , there is a long chain of rock and the bird circling over the head .
you know how it is .
i expected that ... you would know .

i'll pick you up friday at 8 and we'll eat .
one more thing ...
do you have a name?
or should i just keep calling you miss?

i find you attractive .
your aggresive moves make me know that you feel the same way .

what are you doing?
i'm attempting to isolated pattern reoccurances with the imperial articles all the time .
and you?

you said that .
i didn't think that you were listening .
i was listening .
it's beautiful .
alicia , is that we should have a long term commitment?
i need some kind of proof .

william , my circumstances has changed .
alicia is pregant .
i told you attachments are dangerous .

i get myself into something .
i think i'm about to need some help .
now you tell me .
what is it?
professor nash , welcome .
after .
so ... you can see that the zero ... of the imams isn't functioning .
the singularies in space times ... singularies in space times then ...
and conventional numberic book ... it breaks down ... the face of realistic exploration .
sometimes our expectations are betray by the numbers . unbearable and impossible to sign any ...
rasional ... in value ...
professor nash !
hold it !
professor nash !
professor nash?
let's avoid the scene , shall we?
what do you want?
my name is rosen .
dr rosen .
i'm a psychiatrist .
forgive me if i don't seem persuasive .
i like you to come with me , john .
just for a chat .
it appears that i have no choice .
help me !
somebody !
somebody help me !
get off me .
i know who you are .
charles , they are russians ...
call somebody , charles .
they are russians .
stay away from me ...
