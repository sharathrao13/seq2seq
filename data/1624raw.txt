script
you've ruined my life .
look , what you've done to me .
i'll take of my shoe and crush your bonce !
they want to mess up my life , prick my brain with injections .
i'm not mad to accept that .
they order me to eat powders , to swallow electric bulbs .
they've bind my soul and lead it like a bear .
i am not bozana the she bear .
they want my wings .
what will my spirit do without wings?
my spirit flies .
she cries , sings or laughs , when she wants to .
when god lived down here , he couldn't get along with us gypsies , so he had to go up there .
it's not my fault .
playing
propagate , procreate .
god help me .
you would beat me even if you threw them the wrong way .
everything i earned has gone .
if only i had a person in front of me , i wouldn't be sorry about it .
but no , he's a swine .
he takes and he smiles .
god , what have i done to you?
i'll give it all .
i'll even sell my house if i need to .
just as long as i beat him .
i'll work for 20 years , if that's my destiny .
my fate will change , and i'll have more luck .
if you would help me once more , god .
did you get drunk?
do you want to ruin my wedding?
speak !
what should i do now?
music
directed by
god , for once , help me .
the house will be white like milk .
i must tidy up my house , so my leg sees a white god .
here , take the money .
thank you for healing my husband .
take the turkey for luck .
i don't charge for healing .
a little more , a little more .
eat .
don't cry daca , i beg you .
perhan , look what i've brought you .
is it mine?
only yours .
you obey me .
you're grandma's sweetheart .
mine alone?
yours !
you're a good person , you work , you take care of your sister .
danira , look .
i'll give you my soul if you're a good boy .
whose bird is this?
perhan's .
he works .
you give everything you get to perhan .
he's a good boy .
you give perhan everything , but nothing to me .
i'm not a war criminal !
don't you see?
don't act stupid .
i'll lose my mind .
perhanu this , perhanu that !
eveything only to perhan !
you and your perhan can live in yugoslavia , i'm going to germany .
i'm leaving !
get it?
go away !
what have you done to me?
you've disgraced me !
why are you beating me?
don't curse me , mother !
woman , where is that actor of yours?
look , what he did to my daughter .
do you have any problems , old woman?
i'll put out his eyes !
i'll kill him !
don't push me away , old woman .
where is your son?
call him immediately .
call him !
sit , calm down .
i won't sit .
i want you to call your son .
find him at once .
you chat a lot .
he pumped up my daughter , and she's not even 11 years old .
find him at once !
he disgraced her .
why did you come to me?
i'll pull out your eyes !
call your son at once !
he ruined my daughter .
i'll kill you .
me?
look at you , what a disgrace !
stop it .
and you?
you felt nice , when you lied under him .
i know your tricks .
you want money .
you have to pay because your son fucks anything that moves .
my brothers will castrate him .
sit down .
ok , i'll sit down .
there .
i sit .
call your son .
let him say , if he'll marry her .
if he wants her , you can do nothing about it .
when she sees my son her eyes are like blinkers .
don't tell me !
she just winks , gives herself to others .
blinkers?
shame on you , old woman .
winged , sunny bird .
what trouble brought you here , child?
worse then trouble .
ruza turned the house upside down .
she wants everything to glare on holiday .
perhan , give the girl some special lime !
do you hear me?
i've come to buy soome lime .
go , run !
sit down .
who'll carry such a sack?
i will , if you'll help me .
do you know how to make lime?
listen .
the most important thing is temperature .
without constant fire you cannot burn lime .
fire is the basis of everything .
wood burns , smoke goes through the oven , the air warms up , iron plate gets white hot .
limetone burns and then goes out .
in the end everything turns to white dust .
only god knows , how much is heat is needed for it .
do you know how to kiss?
no house would be white without lime , plum jam would be sour .
do you know how to kiss?
grandma thinks , that lime was the breast of the rocky mother .
mother of the forest and mother of the rock had a quarrel .
the forest mother tore her breast off with her teeth .
that's why lime is white as milk .
the earth gave it birth , the water baptised it , the fire breast fed it .
you don't know how to kiss .
i know , in a film way .
like richard gere .
at dawn we'll be in mexico .
at dawn?
is it hot in mexico?
it's hot .
it'll be wonderful .
you , me , muchachos .
calm down .
how long can you kiss without breathing in?
fifteen or twenty minutes .
no !
my god !
you've got magnet on your lips .
shall i show you something?
look at the can .
fata morgana !
stop , the can !
stop !
you've come to propose her?
me .
what?
you're proposing?
this brat has come to spoil our vasilica !
look at him !
inside !
azra , stay here .
what?
i said inside the house !
azra , stay here !
inside , if i tell you !
are you deaf?
you've ruined my life .
what's up with you?
you've swallowed up my soul .
and you !
you army bastard !
one doesn't know what faith you belong to !
neither gypsy nor non gypsy .
you haven't got a single penny in your pocket !
you army bastard !
what are you waiting for , get lost !
and you?
you're silent as a grave !
you don't even open your mouth , you asshole !
you've turned into a grave !
my god !
has anybody seen anything like it?
help me neighbours !
he wants to kill me !
help !
he'll kill me !
i'll pull out your eyes !
help !
is anybody there?
hurry , neighbours !
he wants to slaughter me !
dear grandma !
161 00 : 16 : 35, 007 > 00 : 16 : 37, 526
in a world , that does not understand me , there is no place for me .
when i finish writing this lettes , i'll swallow it .
i don't want anybody to find it , because i would be later ashamed , of killing myself because for a woman .
i cannot live a second more without azra .
her mother , the three headed snake , does not allow me to see her .
yours , perhan .
my name is not zabit , if i don't jump over the shadow !
one , two , three , now !
damned shadow !
the moonlight smiles .
azra !
around fire we snivel , cry rises , my shadow shivers , laughter lowers .
what is this pet doing at this hour?
azra !
i love you !
i'm going !
who are you , politician , to hang yourself?
come down immediately !
down , i said !
damn you , you stupid fool !
you'll hang here?
come down .
neighbour !
open !
it's me , zabit mehmedovski .
come in .
welcome .
happy vasilica !
may god be with you .
good luck .
i've brought you this donkey .
i rather not tell where i found it .
what are you doing?
i'm crying .
does he cry too?
he cries .
you see she's sorry too .
i'll bring the accordion , so you'll play for grandma .
fool !
if you were my son , i would kill you this moment ! .
here , the accordion .
play .
play the one that grandma likes .
it's absolutely romantic outside .
too bad we're not young , so we could dance in the park .
why wouldn't you dance with such a handsome man?
how do you like it?
absolutely romantic !
you'll burn me !
grandma , are you sleeping?
i'm sleeping .
you sleep as well .
grandma , sit down by my side .
was my mother beautiful?
like a mountain fairy .
when she gave birth to daca , her belly stretched .
i went to a witch .
she said , that she came upon a a water devil .
she gave her some spells , but nothing helped .
i took her to a hodja .
germany is my homeland .
merdzan , why didn't your return there?
he said she betrayed the path of the ancestors .
he read to her from the koran on his head .
to no purpose .
the doctor gave her the medicines and injections , but to no avail .
she died in my hands .
she was young .
god gave , god took .
what can i do .
daca's father is not my father?
no .
your father is a slovenian .
he was here in the army .
he promised your mother heaven on earth , but then he left .
then i'm an army bastard .
ruza told the truth .
let her eat shit !
you are grandmas child .
sleep now .
go back , we're not going together today .
sit there and take care of daca .
are you deaf?
everbody here !
let them see who came !
ahmed dida , champion .
ahmed , you rich man , what a car have you got !
from distant italy , everything shines on it !
hi , ahmed .
how are you?
what a nice dress !
white feather !
care for a game?
at twelve at the old place .
deal , no problem .
i've ran away from a madhouse .
give me some money .
i've come as a man , to propose your daughter .
go out .
out .
why do you drag along like a cat?
get lost at once .
i beg you .
even my grandma agreed .
you've come to propose her?
i said , i will not give her away .
you have no job .
you have no working skills .
you should learn to transfer money into banks rather the cans .
slowly .
my daughter is a beauty .
you're not worth her .
get lost !
do i have to tell you a hundred times?
get lost !
calm down .
i won't calm down !
grandma , help .
a lot of people are proposing her !
do you want to tear off my grandson's head?
what madness has gone into you?
sit , aunty .
i will .
i want my grandson to ger married .
i'll bring the money .
i'll give it to you .
here , look .
what can your grandson do?
he can move cans back and forth .
why can't he transfer money into banks?
and your money doesn't mean a thing to him .
what would he do with it?
my daughter is worth billions .
i didn't give her to anyone .
come , azra .
look at her .
beauty !
all white .
you're very proud of her .
why not?
look at her .
take your grandsons hand and leave .
i'll be back .
you'll be kissing my feet .

this treasure is not for you .
i'm a great she devil .
i'll bring you trouble .
you'll be kissing my feet !

head up !
it's never later for jumping into water and marrying .
so use your head , grandma's sweetheart .

no .
it's not going well .
when do you intend to return your depth?
tomorrow .
we're leaving tomorrow .
come here .
where are we going?
where are we going?
into the circle .
so police doesn't take us by surprise .
you can repay everything .
maybe even earn something .
two cards .
uncle , come home at once !
robert is choking .
he'll die .
mother , save me !
they've fleeced me .
you've got the receipts there .
they're not pregnant women .
i owe money to dangerous people .

i've got into bad company .
don't chase my dreams away .
give me the money .
they'll scatter my brains all over .
i'll show you !
give me the money , for fucks sake !
i'll kill you all !

for the last time : money or life !

will you give me the money?
when you find the money , i'll return the house .
don't cry , mother .
you fool , fool .
god have mercy on you .
once there was the sky and earth husband and wife .
they had five children : sun , moon , fire , fog and wing .
they built a wonderful city and settled them there .
the bantering sun wanted to separate the earth from the sky , but it didn't succeed .
others have tried as well , but with no avail .
when wind rushed at them with all its power , the earth separated from the sky .
hatidza !
it's a matter of life !
save my child at once !
no matter the price !
blood is the biggest secret .
blood and power .
listen .
the child's spirit has not yet been woken .
merdzan , my son !
my eyes !
who did this to you?
his brothers .
what did you do , you scoundrels?
i treat your child , and this is how you repay me .
your disgusting !
get lost , you scoundrel !
my sweetheart , mother's sunshine .
they've disgraced us .
is this your gratitude?
i haven't the slightest idea , i swear by my son .
may they all die on me , if i know anything about it .
i'll show them , to the very last one .
here , take as much as you want .
get lost , you scoundrel .
what will the money do me any good?
nobody lifted a hand upon ahmeda dzida .
god proteced you , for saving my son .
my sweetheart , my life .
come handsome , we'll take care of everything ..
you've slaughtered my turkey .
now i'll slaughter you .
you fools !
you're sucking my blood .
you'll bury me alive in the grave .
what are you doing?
where should i run from these fools?
go in your bed .

this one was mine .
i'll buy you three hundred turkeys .
sit down .

you're driving my nuts .

what are you doing you bastard?
you're beating your uncle .
poor fellow .
when i get you , i'll brake your neck .
i'll brake it like this .
i'll kill you , you miserable soul .
you'll lose all your teeth !
i'll break you into pieces like a pumpkin !
if you hit me one more time you bastard , i'll crush you !
you should be kissing my feet .
where are you going?
sit .
i've remembered .
would you like to pay for robert?
you've said yourself that doctors couldn't help him .
speak .
do you see that girl?
did you see her leg?
there's a hospital in ljubljana , where they extend the bones .
you pay for that and we're even .
when i go to italy , i'll leave her in ljubljana .
i won't leave her alone .
i will go with her .
please do , it's the right thing to do .
relatives help each other .
i'll drive both .
don't cry , daca .
i'll go with you .
i can't go to a hospital .
i am afraid i'll die there .
don't be afraid .
merdzan !
what have you done , you fool?
leave him alone , he's crazy .
devils have possesed him .
look , what he's done to the house .
why are you looking at them?
they're good as angels .
they won't present trouble for you .
listen , is this hereditary?
the leg?
you're skills .
can anyone from them do something like that?
perhan knows a little bit .
nothing useful .
what's not useful?
nothing , doesn't matter .
what?
perhan , show him what you can do .
he wants to drive your sister to the hospital so she will recover .
show him for your sister's sake .
i can't .
show him , do you hear me? !
i can't .
he'll heal your sister .
show him what you can do .
elvis , jaser , rambo !
bring the " documents " instruments .
take care of them like the pupil of the eye .
they're everything i have .
don't worry .
this taxi driver is the best .
he came especially from brcko .
you'll have a leg like marilyn monroe .
neighbours , good luck .
come back in good health !
you should go as well .
i'll open you an ambulance in my van .
i can't , i'm sick .
don't cry , grandma .
she'll come back .
if it was fine , i wouldn't cry .
i forgot to give you the food for your trip .
don't cry , daca .
everything played out like in dreams .
i'm leaving , wait for me .
comply with everything that i inform you through grandma .
love me like your eyes .
when i return , you'll live like a minister .
my sister and grandma will live with us .
ok?
when you see your uncle , run to the other side of the quart .
deal?
yes .
don't cry , hatiza .
from today you need your eyes to take care of my bride .
make sure , that her feet wont be wondering more in the sky , then stepping on earth .
how can i not cry , if my soul hurts?
take care of your sister like the pupil of the eye .
don't cry .
irfan !
when the king of wind fell upon mother , the sky separated from the earth .
the the suns ...
don't cry , daca .

i'll do everything , just don't cry .
i've stopped .
i see mother .

is she beautiful?
very much .
what does she look like?
she's got hair , eyes , nose ,
lips , everything .
good day , doctor .
we've talked on the phone .
don't leave me alone , i beg you .
she is afraid .
i told her , that she'll have a leg like marilyn monroe , when she's in your hands .
what's your name , little beauty?
denira feric .
good girl .
don't be afraid , daca .
comrad tito was treated here himself .
let me look at you .
doctor , i'll stay with her .
how can you demand that , if you're healthy?
you can't do that , ahmed .
do you have any documents?
i'm sorry , you can't go here .
health insurance?
you just admit her .
in two days you'll get everything .
how can you demand to stay with the child?
who will feed you , where will you sleep?
aren't you ashamed of taking a place of a patient?
i've promised grandma .
we promised that we'll cure her leg ..
go with me to italy ..
you'll work , you'll be able to build a house .
she's got osteomielitis .
she has to be operated .
what is it?
the operation is expensive .
perhan !
don't leave me alone , please !
please , don't leave me !
don't leave me alone .
now you aren't doing well .
when you'll earn millions , you'll be grateful to me .
where are these babies from?
i bought them on the way .
why?
so robert would have company .
it suck nicer , if it's not alone .
grownups prefer breasts for themselves , children don't .
who sells them in such small size?
those who have to .
he has 11 of them .
he found himself a mistress , who gave him these two as a present .
she's married too .
to hide her shame , she gave them to me .
look at him !
he's gifted as his father !
zef , the cowboy film has just begun .
feebles , damn you !
take off your clothes !
to the bone !
come in .
you're next .
go fuck yourself !
i'll hit you right in the forehead !
when he comes to you , say " ottanta " .
if he says " cinquanta " , say yes .
now get lost .
read !
they've imposed on my taxes for the last six years ..
two penalties , three offences and one sentence .
i have to give everything , or they will evict me .
what do i have to do with this?
where should i get money from for your sister?
how?
read it , if you don't believe me .
i'm poor as a church mouse .
ruined .
they've fried me .
not to mention the bill for roberta and the hospital !
that is yet to come .
help me a bit !
i'll help , but in a fair way .
and what fair thing can you do?
one after another , god may give you luck .
that's it , only fair .
bosnian , come back .
stand on the chair .
who told you to do this?
shut up !
if he doesn't want to work , he just doesn't have to !
he won't heal his sister , he won't build a house , he won't get married .
give him the money , let him be damned .
when you return to ljubljana , take your sister .
do you understand?
i feel pity for her .
you live like a dog !
in dust nibble the bones .
give him the money for the trip .
let him pack and go to the station .
perhan , look .
dear grandma !
i'm alive and healthy .
don't you worry about me .
i'm in milano .
the beauty and wealth is breathtaking .
one can cross himself from the astonishment .
if you were here , you could not get a wink from the happiness .
we could have a sack of money .
this isn't important now .
take care of my azra , so she doesn't end like the neighbour , whose feet wondered more in the sky , then stepped on the earth .
my hatidza !
i have realised here that god , is not a blind cat .
ahmed is like a father to me .
he speaks italian , barks at the stars .
he has his people everywhere ,
lawyers , judges , priests and cops .
he takes care of me like i was his son .
i will earn a lof of money .
i'll build a house , just like ahmed's .
only i'll build according to an italian plan .
a painter will paint this picture on the frontage .
don't worry about danira .
i've seen with my own eyes that the doctor is ahmed's man .
what should i buy you?
i've bought uncle a tv .
he can put it in his pocket , let the whole world stand openmouthed .
latest technological advancement .
i won't spare with the money for the wedding .
let the old and the young remember perhan's wedding .
yours , perhan .
where is irfan?
where is irfan , you nitwit?
i don't know .
irfan's not here .
what do you mean?
why didn't you pay attention?
don't appear before my eyes without him !
out !
don't come without him .
where should i look for him?
be off with you !
your problem !
that's nothing .
tears?
oh my , mommy , that's not good .
what's missing in your full house?
tell me please , what !
take the white coffee , white bread , white cheese .
take the marmelade , bird's milk .
everything that i have .
you want a leave , to go on sick leave?
what do you want first?
shame on you , son . /
is this thank you? /
i'm crazy and naive because i trust people .
remember without work there is no happiness .
what did you do?
you've turned my life into manure !
who's the boss here?
who gives the orders here?
damn your spoilt blood !
who's the boss? !
what is up with you , ahmed?
give me the tablets for pressure .
give me the tablets !
who is your husband him or me , you gypsy bitch? !
come , come .
i've come to tell you , what your grandma is telling you .
if you don't come immediately , the silverteeth will eat you .
woman with the silver teeth is the wolf's victim .
woman with the silver teeth is the wolf's victim ...
quick , get up !
go !
why are you hesitating?
everybody out !
everybody to the police !
let's go !
all to the police !
they will take your passport .
he says not to move from here .
that is good , it cures .
you are my brother .
are you sending money for my sister's health treatment?
every first in the month .
for the house too .
the foundation has already been laid .
now they're building walls .
i only have you and robert left .
dzamila .
everyone come here !
from today on perhan is the parade commander .
obey him more then zef or sadama .
is that clear?
young man !
are you looking for someone?
they are now mine .
do you know that?
look .
tell the big boss , that sadam is not crazy , to rot in jail because of him .
you know , i put the guilt on zef .
and he , as it befits for the younger brother , took all the blame on himself .
ciao , handsoome .
fuck that luck .
buy ones like these .
for the business .
some baby .
and some pregnant woman .
it's easier to get across the border .
my god , look .
an entirely different person .
something of each if it's possible .
that's the best .
may god bless you , i'm counting on you .
where is that house of mine , that is being built?
i would like to see the construction .
house?
next to mine .
where else would it be?
are we brothers or not?
but you musn't go to our place .
why not?
that's what the lawyer said , that acuired the passport for you .
there's a big confusion .
it's being reported in newspapers , on radio , tv .
they've made a movie about people , that sell children abroad .
don't go there , please .
go to the ferryboat bari bar , and then to monte negro and bosnia .
i wanted to see grandma and azra , to visit my sister in ljubljana .
no , by no means , please .
only to the south .
he're the address of a man from tuzla .
find a wife for me .
i'll sen dzamila away .
rate her as you would rate her for yourself .
go , good luck .
come here !
i'm not guilty , i don't know anything .
may i get blind if i know anything .
i don't know anything .
i've come as it befits .
oh my .
billions !
i don't have to kiss hands .
is this for me?
look at him the big businessman .
how did you earn that much money?
he came so he would trick my daughter with the money .
look !
did she get married?
no .
what can i do .
woman like woman .
she did what she decided .
i don't know how to deal with her .
i wonder myself .
what should i do with her?
i don't know myself !
and the child she bears?
it's supposably yours .
what do you think?
ask your uncle .
god , what are you doing to me?
a black train has come mother .
it has come , mother , a black morning .
neighbour , there is no sense in drinking that much .
i also drank brandy , but it doesn't help .
look , the drink has changed you into a woman .
like you aren't happy , to see me .
grandma loves you .
what are you doing to your head?
come , don't be afraid .
you've come with me .
what lays on your heart , grandma?
mine is fine .
what's with yours?
where did you leave your sister?
in ljubljana .
she should return back soon .
bring me a glass of brandy .
you take the chair and sit down .
why does your wife cry?
the bitch has to let out water , and she releases it through her eyes .
why do you trust your mother in law more then your wife?
since i've got myself lying ,
i don't trust noone anymore .
if you don't trust at all , god will abandon you .
where did you get this?
where did you get these clothes?
i've earned it with these ten fingers .
i will build a house with them as well .
who will live in this house?
you and me , grandma .
i will not live in this house .
my spirit doesn't want to .
god forbid , that you would live in this house .
don't speak like that .
what have you become .
you were honest once .
now you changed for the worse .
what am i like , grandma?
you've broken my heart .
you've spoilt entirely .
let me tell you something son .
all this is a fata morgana .
you gave me money .
i may die tomorrow .
who will return you?
take the money back .
you've burnt your hand !
you know how that hurts .
you're doing yourself evil things .
stop playing !
you're playing madness .
you'll kill a man .
back !
perhan , wait for me .
neighbour , you're blind drunk !
what are you looking at?
get in !
my neighbour is my concern .
chandelier !
scales !
cooker !
this present is from a wedding witness .
let's see what's inside .
a bit of silence , please .
bread !
money !
gold !
a limuosine is coming .
the chauffeur is opening the door .
the bride is stepping out .
the groom is carrying her in his arms .
mother in law is offering the daughter in law bread and sugar , so she would have a sweet life .
be happy .
the groom kisses the bride .
mother in law leads daughter in law into the house .
the groom is being beaten to obtain power .
he'll need it .
grandma and her grandson will now dance .
how beautiful he is , how elegant , wise , civilized and pedantic !
grandma's grandson .
my living monument .
get up , come with me .
you and ruza must help me .
find some cripples to go begging and a pregnant woman with the same fate , as mine has .
here's your advance .
we'll find some cripples .
and how do you intend to sell your own child?
you will meet with a terrible accident .
first , the child is not mine .
i will bring up no bastard .
and second , i won't repeat .
only under these conditions will i marry her .
go out so they won't see us .
are you building another house here?
if we built it you would see it .
a house is not a needle .
if there is a god , the kids will go into the world , to work and earn money .
they just musn't disgrace themselves .
let them build a house like other people , with their own labor by the sweat of their face .
i am already old .
i can't work anymore .
why not?
they're still young .
you know we burn lime .
merdzan doesn't want to work .
may i come to you?
not even dead .
did you understand?
i can hardly wait that perhan , my sweetheart , returns .
i can hardly wait that he gets a child .
so that this wish of mine turns true as well .
do with me whatever you want .
but why?
you know well why .
don't foist me a magpie instead of a gosling .
this child is diligent , obedient , qualified .
i'm sorry for speaking about this .
something is pressing me in my soul , so words are like a cure .
my son comes at midnight , the house is for him like an inn .
he eats and goes to the whores .
i don't know what's wrong with him .
my golden one , perhan , is the best person in this world .
he's not like my son , bastard .
if you knew what kind of daughter i had .
his mother was a beauty .
he looks just like her .
she died young .
i fell ill because of her .
what should i tell you?
are you alive?
i'm alive .
here , eat .
perhan , you must believe me .
the child is ours .
merdzan assaulted me when i was three months pregnant .
don't lie .
shut up , don't lie .
i'm not lying .
i don't want to bring up a bastard !
i will sell him .
then will make our own child .
give me your hand .
this one is ours too .
believe yourself , if you don't believe me .
i concieved when we slept together on st. george's day .
i've calculated everything .
i swear by my life .
i know he's a bastard .
we'll make our own .
i said what i said .
why?
this one is ours too .
wait .
something in me has turned upside down .
i dreamt that you gave birth to a white bird .
when i came near .
wait .
what do you want?
you've done everything well .
but where is a wife for me?
couldn't you find her?
where is my house?
why did you lie about building a house for me?
were you at home?
from where would i bring my wife then?
i thought .
what did you think?
that you picked up one on the way .
what do i know .
you know , ahmed .
you know everything .
why did you lie to me?
sadam lied to me !
i gave him the money for your house .
he put it into his own pocket .
he came yesterday to laugh in my face .
i'm sorry , i'm not responsible for your house .
i swear by my child .
believe me .
if you don't want to , go .
leave me alone .
may i die .
i will give you half of my house .
here are the papers .
i will call the lawyer tomorrow so they will certify it in court .
i may not be much long .
and robert?
i loved him more then life .
and now?
i don't know .
i obsere him every day and everything seems suspicious to me .
the eyes , the nose , hands .
he doesn't look like me in any way .
we're brothers in that way as well the wives cheated on us both .
boy !
look , perhan !
a boy !
let us not bewitch him .
azra !
no , azra .
i ask you like god , don't leave me !
i love you !
azra !
god is nevertheless a blind cat .
he looked at me while i was hiding treasure in the canal .
he tied my sould with a rope and let the flood wash away the gold and money .
first he gave me wealth , in the end with the treasure he took my soul as well .
i had so much gold , dear hatidza , that i could build a house out of gold coins . and cover the roof with them .
we could build a big house , we could touch the moon from its roof .
a cruel fate has come upon me .
the more i rack my brain about where it came from , the bigger is the earthquake in my head and the more i go away from the truth .
maybe you have also put a spell on me , grandma tidza when i told you that i don't trust anyone anymore , when i caught myself lying .
if you don't trust at all , god will abandon you .
you won't be good nor to god nor to people .
you know , i am not like that good to people , but i was deceived by a man , whom i trusted more then god .
ahmed was both god and father for me .
i wrote to you that daca stayed at the hospital .
even your own eyes can decieve yourself .
if i could , i would put out my eyes and get blind .
only later i have realised , what a trap ahmed set me up .
where is he?
he ran away .
where?
who knows .
he drove me away and found himself another woman .
dzamila , talk , if you know .
he has reconciled with his brothers .
they united the slaves and disappeared .
did you take my sister from ljubljana?
where?
speak , i'll kill you !
leave him alone , you fool !
to rome .
may god give you luck .
help the poor girl .
did you see this girl?
no , i don't know her .
fuck you !
fuck you , asshole !
you said i shouldn't return home without danira .
i travelled the whole world from end to end .
ahmed as though as he would turn into a mole , and danira is nowhere to be seen .
i've been looking for ahmed for three years .
i'd like to live 300 years , just to find him and pull out his heart .
i've been searching for her for days .
this has made me turn into wind , my dreams have evaporated like dust .
i can't dream anymore .
a gypsy without dreams is like a church without a roof ,
like a textbook without letters .
yours , perhan .
danira !
perhan !
brother !
god !
as long as i have found you !
and your leg?
does it hurt?
same .
oh my .
you know what happened?
what?
he said that the hospitals in italy are better .
that they will admit us here .
that you and i will be together .
since then i have been begging .
he have traviled over 101 cities .
today he's getting married .
ahmed?
yes .
and you have a son .
he's just like you .
they're waiting that he grows up , so they can sell him .
perhan !
what is it?
what's your name?
perhan .
and yours?
perhan .
don't lie !
why are you lying?
hurry up , please .
go , they will see us ..
this is your father .
give him your hand .
wait for me here .
i'll be right back .
don't go anywhere , please .
i must buy a gift for grandma .
come back soon .
buy her a dishwashing sponge .
don't forget about my accordion .
don't worry .
if i'm late , i will catch up with you on the next stattion .
take it .
what's wrong?
i'm sad .
don't be .
let 'wave to him .
daddy !
perhan , stop !
i am angry with you .
why?
you won't return , you won't buy me an accordion
let me be damned , if i don't return .
go now .
go .
irfan !
is it you , perhan?
help me .
don't worry .
what cigarettes do you smoke?
good cigarettes !
cover my back .
don't 'you worry .
ahmed , good luck !
dance , ahmed !
where are you , birdie?
look at him , ahmed .
where are you , perhan , my child?
i've come to you .
i'll serve you till i die .
you are my father .
you and god .
accept me or kill me .
why would i kill you , you poor fellow?
kill me , sinful thoughts have come to my mind .
give him food to eat .
look how thin he is .
who is this?
some fool , a poor man .
eat the cake !
die in shit !
hurry up .
quick , to the bridge .
i will kill you for preventing my marriage !
run .
you've ruined my youth , and i'll destroy your head .
let it be , what shall be .
i will catch up with you , even if you were a bird .
for fuck sake !
oh , god !
god , what have you done?
you have turned as though the whole world has turned .
merdzan will lift you up again , but you must help me .
if you can't , i'll lift you up myself .
did you see perhan?
why?
he left you without a father and mother , but he washed your feet .
he didn't know how to call you .
you let him among the wolves .
lead him where you think is the best place in that world .
do you see these two dices?
let them fall , for once let them fall , as i wish .
my wish would come true .
and may i not be merdzan anymore , if i don't fulfill your wish .
and throw the dices like they should be .
bluester
