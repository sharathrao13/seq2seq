ohh .
ted , are you all right?
sure .
aah .
oh .
ok .
ok , ted .
ok , let's roll .
all right , folks , let's go .
it's over .
so , anyway , uh ... school ended a couple days later ... and her father got transferred ... to florida in july .
so i worked all summer ... to pay off those debts and ...
well , i never saw mary again .
that was ... what?
13 years ago .
that's very interesting .
anyway ...
i know it's not the type of thing you'd forget ... but i guess i just ...
i kinda ...
i must have blocked it out of my head or something ...
'cause i was driving down the highway last week ... and i started thinking about mary ... and all of a sudden ... it was like i couldn't breathe .
i mean , i was ...
i was ...
i felt like i was gonna die .
so i pulled off the road ... and i just sorta stopped in this ...
i guess it was a rest area .
i was just kind of shaking and ...
you know ... rest areas are homosexual hangouts .
how about you?
the big " l.
hmm?
ever been?
what?
in love .
well ... once .
mary .
oh , god .
not mary again .
look , i know it was brief ... but it was ...
it was definitely love , dom .
i mean ... crushes don't last for 13 years , right?
what ever happened to mary?
i told you ... she moved with her family to miami .
so why don't you look her up?
i did ... once .
i called .
she wasn't listed .
so that's it?
you get one little bump in the road and give up?
it's probably for the best .
after 13 years ... she's probably gonna think i'm a stalker or something .
you know what you should do is hire a private investigator .
you know , to find her , follow her around .
she won't know anything .
no way !
that's way too creepy .
besides , she's probably married ... with a couple of kids by now .
girls like mary ... they don't stay single .
hey , i've got an idea .
there's this guy down in my office .
his name's healy .
he's a claims investigator .
he's a hell of a bloodhound .
he shoots down to miami every couple of weeks .
he can help you out .
this guy runs a little hot , but he gets thejob done .
so ...
dom says you're looking for some lady friend .
you knew back at school .
yeah .
yeah .
i don't buy it , but it's cute .
you're not buying what?
ted , i'm the kind of guy ... who likes to shoot from the hip .
ahem .
i want you to level with me .
come on , let's talk .
did you knock this skirt up?
huh?
no .
she's blackmailing you , right?
blackmailing me?
no .
you want her dead , don't you?
dead?
were you ...
you're not serious , are you?
you expect me to believe ... this is a straight stalker case?
come on !
ahh .
looks like we found your mary , ted .
husband ... negative .
children and a labrador ... negative .
tight little package ... affirmative .
seeking sensitive wasp doctor ...
to share candlelit dinners ...
long walks in coconut grove ... marriage .
is she looking for a corpse?
you have to be specific when you write those .
you have to say " seeking deaf mute ...
with , " you know ...
3 pound cock and trust fund .
i want a guy who can play 36 holes ... and still have enough energy ... to take me and warren to a ball game ... and eat hot dogs .
i'm talking sausage hot dogs , beer .
not light beer , but beer .
that's my ad .
print it up .
mmm .
fatty who likes beer and golf .
jeez , mary ... where you gonna find a gem like that?
ok , well , here's the catch ...
he has to be self employed .
like a drug dealer?
no , i was thinking along the lines , maybe ... of somebody like ... an architect or something .
but i want somebody with freedom in theirjob ... you know?
somebody who can do it anywhere ... and just leave at a drop of a hat .
and where would you and your beer bellied architect ... be going to?
mmm .
super bowl?
that's good .
i don't know .
maybe a few months in nepal .
mm hmm .
and you'd probably dump the poor guy ... halfway to katmandu .
what's that supposed to mean?
it means you change your mind too much .
no , i don't .
oh , come off it , mary .
remember that gorgeous corn fed white boy honey ... that you just dumped like yesterday's garbage .
what was his name?
pack man .
ok .
we had fun for a while .
mary , cut the crap .
what really happened with brett?
yeah .
brett seemed so sweet .
you know what tucker said brett told him?
he said that if warren wasn't in my life ... that he would have popped the question ... a long time ago .
oh .
what a schmuck .
to hell with brett , you know?
pop , you wanna get me a whiskey sour ... when you get a sec?
whiskey sour coming up .
got some excellent news for you my friend .
oh , yeah?
excellent?
i think your life's about to change .
really?
so ... so you found her?
oh , yeah .
and you were right , man .
she really is something else .
my god .
really .
so ... so she hasn't ... she hasn't changed at all , huh?
well , that i couldn't say .
let me ask you something .
was mary a little big boned back in high school?
big boned?
no , no .
not at all .
no .
i guess she packed on a few pounds over the years .
oh , yeah .
so she's a little ... she's a little chubby?
oh , i'd say about a deuce , deuce and a half .
not bad .
oh , my .
a deuce and a half , huh?
you know .
you shit out a bunch of kids ... and you're bound to put on a few pounds .
oh , so she's , um ... she's married .
no , no .
she's never been .
that's the good news .
huh?
4 kids , 3 different guys ... but no rock .
hyperactive little fuckers , too .
tough to keep up with in a wheelchair , i bet .
she's in a wheelchair?
mary's in a wheelchair?
i thought that was part of your kick .
excuse me , i ordered a whiskey sour .
yeah , whatever .
are you sure it's the same mary?
are you sure you have the right person?
oh , yeah .
it's mary all right .
the brother warren?
hey , don't look so shocked , ted .
it's been a long time .
i bet you've changed a lot the last 13 years ... haven't you?
what , do you think your shit don't stink?
no , i don't think ...
i ...
i mean , yes , it does ...
ok , i got all the information you need .
i got it off her bookie .
nice guy .
you really should look her up , ted .
i mean , she's a real spark plug , this one .
well , thank you .
thanks , healy .
good work .
uh , ted ... don't you want the name of the housing project?
what?
man on tv : ... for 1, 995 .
see the sarone boys on route 1 in south attleboro ... and right here ... on jefferson boulevard in warwick ...

oh , i'm sorry .
it's just a job , really .
you know , something to keep me moving .
my real passion is my hobby .
really?
what's that?
i work with retards .
isn't that a little politically , um , incorrect?
well , the hell with that .
no one's gonna tell me ... who i can and can't work with , right?
no .
i mean ...
we got this one kid ...
mongo .
he's got a forehead ...
like a drive in movie theater ... but he's a good ship ... so we don't bust his chops too much .
so one day , mongo gets out of his cage ...
what , they keep him in a cage?
well , it's ... it's just an enclosure ...
no , but they keep him confined .
right , yeah .
that's bullshit !
well , that's what i said !
so i went out ... and i got him , um , i got him a leash .
a leash !
yeah , one of those ones ... you can hook onto the clothesline ... and he can run back and forth .
and , uh , there's plenty of room ... for him to ... to dig and , uh , play .
that kid has really , uh ... he's really blossomed , you know?
now i can , uh , take him to movies .
baseball games .
fun stuff .
yeah .
sounds cool .
oh , yeah , it's cool for them ... but for me it's much more than that .
for me , it's ... it's heaven .
y'know?
those goofy bastards are just about ... the best thing i've got goin 'in this ... crazy world .
hey , dipshit , be careful with that thing , will you?
what?
you heard me .
you already put a fuckin 'nick in my piano .
well , i'll try to be a little more careful .
what are you , a baby?
you wimpin 'out on me?
it's just that this is a little bit heavy ... that's all .
what if the families don't want a class action?
oh , god !

ok , fine .
we'll go over it again .
mary's a fox !

you know , it's ... it's like that movie harold and maude .
aw ...
i don't watch the new ones .
well , you should because it's probably ... the greatest love story of our time .
the point is ... is that love isn't about ... money or social standings ... or age .
it's about 2 people connecting ... having something in common ... you know , kindred spirits .
fuck kindred spirits .
my little puffy here is going to tell you ... everything you need to know about that guy ... in about 2 seconds flat .
if puffy starts yapping , uh uh .

if you're not happy with the first 7 minutes ... we're going to send you the extra minute free .
you see?
that's it .
that's our motto .
that's where we're coming from .
that's from " a " to " b.
that's right .
that's ...
that's good .
that's good .
unless , of course ... somebody comes up with 6 minute abs .
then you're in trouble , huh?
no !
