our five day fore cast .
next up , the tree girl from elkerton .
living in a tree for an entire year ...
local girl , rianna " hummingbird " holmes , is finally coming down .
unlike the better known julia hill ... the rest of miss holmes 'forest was leveled ... though she did manage to save one giant red wood tree .
all right !
ho ware you doing?
i just want to thank everyone who sent me ... food and letters of support .
especially the mentally handicapped child who sent me this book of poems .
she read my poems !
thank you .
dimples !
come on in the house !
morning , miss de la rosa .
dimples got out again .
i let him out .
well , you have a good day now .
i am a warrior .
on your left .
well , boys and girls ... this is the most important room in the entire police station . this is the most important room in the entire police station .
this is the police evidence room .
this is where i work .
are you a real policeman?
evidence file clerks work very closely with real policemen .
evidence file clerks work very closely with real policemen .
so you're not a real policeman .
as soon as i pass the obstacle course , i'm gonna be a real policeman .
yeah , okay , pal .
all the evidence is arranged by case number .
do you realize we're almost as tall as you?
this field trip sucks .
i think i might have some candy somewhere .
look , everyone marijuana !
i'm sorry .
you're not allowed to touch that .
that's police evidence .
what are you gonna do arrest us?
you're not a real cop .
guys , that's really
i got him !
yea !
mange !
what is going on in here?
let me see that .
thanks , sarge .
right there .
you're missing an " r.
there .
outstanding .
now , who wants to go for a ride with a real police officer?
marvin , what happened to you?
kids .
i can't believe you let a bunch of eight year old kids embarrass you .
i'm gonna really do it this time , dad .
i'm gonna be a real policeman just like you were .
i'll make you so proud of me .
i'm not gonna be a huge loser anymore .
give me that !
stretch it , marvin !
it won't go any further .
back up .
let me give it a shot .
come on , marvin !
maybe this year you won't pee your pants and cry for your mama .
that was a good one , sarge .
don't worry .
nobody remembers that .
listen up .
you have four minutes to complete ... the physical endurance portion of your police examination .
i have personally designed this course ... to simulate actual conditions one might encounter .... in the field .
good luck .
take a good look at that ass .
you'll be following it all day .
ready !
set !
go , marvin !
go !
go , marvin !
you got her !
marvin , take her !
kiss it !
oh , okay .
right .
how does this simulate something that would happen in the field?
come on , marvin !
you got it !
that's it !
marvin , you okay?
at least you didn't pee in your pants .
maybe we should wait till everyone leaves .
pop quiz .
who's this?
mange !
that's four times in a row .
refills?
thank you .
y'all see that shit?
what?
i'm sittin 'in the middle , and she poured my beer first .
so?
don't you see?
it's because i'm black .
maybe she's just being nice .
see , now we're gettin 'to it .
what?
what y'all call " nice , " i call reverse racism .
let's be overly nice to the black man .
let's make up for his ancestors being plucked from their homeland ... crammed by the hundreds into leaky boats with no bathrooms ...
like human tuna fish , and if most of them didn't die on the way over ... they would have to go into show business to make a decent damn livin '.
and now she's gonna pour my beer first?
that's not gonna make up for 400 years of injustice .
no , sir .
not today .
i wish i was black .
i'd have my onion rings by now .
i gotta go take a wizzer .
oh , geez , i'm sorry .
i didn't know anybody was in here .
there's a long line in the ladies 'room .
wait .
you're rianna " hummingbird " holmes .
look , i think it's great what you did , saving that tree ... even though they leveled all those other trees .
glad to see you're doing your part .
i'm sorry .
i'm wasting trees .
they should get one of those
they should get one of those blowjobby things .
i mean , hand jobbies i mean , hand blowers .
bye .
i wrote you a poem .
working out and eating a high protein diet is not enough .
you need a high potency , high mineral , mega amino ... anabolicbody building supplement .
nothing legally will give you all that ... except badger milk .
a badger can lift 20 times its body weight .
can you do that?
our potent supplement is made up of 25 % real badger milk .
if you call now , you'll get ... two cartons of badger milk for the price of one .
check out the pecs on yolanda .
that is pure badger milk .
hey , marv , could you cover for me for a minute?
i'm the only one here .
no problem .
everyone else is down at the softball game .
thanks .
there's a softball game today?
freeze , puke !
put down that vcr !
put it down !
oh , you bought it , did you?
oh , you have a receipt , do you?
my mistake .
i'm new on the force .
police department .
can i help you?
this is mr. tam of tam's restaurant .
i'm being robbed .
tam's restaurant?
that's terrible !
i go there all the time .
you guys have the best orange flavored bean cake .
thank you very much .
the chili peppers give it a real kick .
they're shooting at me now !
hold on .
i'll get some help .
officers needed .
i got a two eleven .
robbery in progress .
hello?
outstanding .
officers needed !
hello?
can you just sit tight until i can reach somebody?
i got a two eleven in progress .
i'm in pursuit .
hello?
two eleven in progress !
that wasn't so bad .
thanks for the lift .
not at all .
dimples , you okay?
the badger milk girl .
she seems nice .
now , that's good badger milk .
hey , fatty .
i gotta go .
marvin , where the hell have you been?
well , last night after you left , i got a call .
two eleven .
robbery in progress at tam's restaurant .
marvin , it was over a week ago .
you've been missing for eight days .
what?
i tried to cover for you .
i told everyone you were an unreliable drunk who disappears for days on end .
so i think you're okay .
thanks a lot .
are you all right , marvin?
do you wanna see a doctor?
no .
i feel great .
on your left .
sure , pass the old guy , big man !
on your left .
sure , pass the old guy , big man !
how's it goin '?
what?
shit !
come on !
come on !
come on , boy !
come on !
oh , easy !
easy !
whoa !
slow down .
wow .
you gotta show me how you do that .
i wish i knew .
i'm marvin .
i'm rianna .
i know .
i met you in the men's room .
oh , yeah .
the fart guy .
so , are all these dogs yours?
kind of .
i volunteer at a pet shelter .
oh , that's great .
yeah , it's pretty cool .
i get to hang out with all sorts of different animals and
at least this time i have a roof over my head .
is something wrong?
no .
nothing's wrong .
why?
nice catch .
thank you .
you should come by the shelter sometime .
you know , you could play frisbee with the dogs .
i'd like that .
bye .
i'm sorry .
miles , i gotta talk to you .
i didn't know you smoked .
i don't .
it's illegal to smoke in the airports .
i just wanted to show you how bad it's gotten .
watch this .
see?
nobody even says anything to me because i'm black .
oh , let's bend the rules for the black guy .
let's let him smoke because he's black .
just because all those old blues musicians never got any royalties ... and had to play one night gigs until they were , like , a hundred ... just so they could pay for their whores , and now i can smoke anywhere i want to .
man , that's bullshit .
something weird happened to me .
yeah?
well , something weird happened to me too .
they made me supervisor .
that's great .
is it?
i've been here 16 days , marvin .
that filipino over there has been here five years .
you know why they made me supervisor?
because you're black?
no .
'cause that bitch is dumb .
excuse me , sir .
i'm in a hurry .
not until i check you with my magic wand , you ain't .
arms out .
i ordered the stuff from the tv , and i think it's working .
flight 32 is now boarding .
physically , there's
that's odd .
do you smell that?
it's this way .
what is?
trust me .
i know what i'm doing .
what , are you crazy or something?
let go of my leg !
get off of me !
he's got drugs on him .
check him .
what are you talkin 'about?
this guy's clean .
he's clean .
you see?
you can go .
no , wait .
hey .
i hope he's on our flight .
that's a huge bitch !
well , i don't know whose that is , but that's not mine .
it's pure heroin .
you're pretty good , buddy .
what's your name?
mange .
marvin mange .
you'll be hearing from us .
chief wilson , could you tell us what happened at the airport?
the drugs were found by the newest member on our force
marvin mange .
here to take you through the arrest is sergeant doug sisk .
thank you , sir .
ladies and gentlemen ... the suspect flew in from colombia  excuse me .
i have a question for officer mange .
is it true that you can smell things in people's butts?
i guess so .
can you smell things that are not in people's butts?
like , say , things in people's pants pockets or wallets?
officer mange , i'm from the free press .
what's up my butt?
uh , sir , i'd rather not .
oh , come on .
what's up there?
car keys .
he's good .
over here !
no more questions .
what about me , sir?
over here , officer mange , please .
excuse me .
can i talk to you for a minute?
look , i don't want to guess what's up your butt , okay?
no , it's not that .
you see , i released you ... to see if you could function normally in society .
but now you're attracting too much attention .
i just can't take the chance .
what are you talking about?
i was the one that found you .
i put you back together .
don't you remember the animals?
well , how do you explain your enhanced sense of smell ... your ability to run twice as fast or jump ten feet in the air?
it's the badger milk .
i ordered it from the tv .
i need you to come with me .
you're crazy .
i'm not going anywhere with you .
sorry about the dart .
i think you'll find everything you need here water , food , a place to work out .
where am i?
well , you were born here , sort of .
you see , when i found you , you were more dead than alive .
the only way to save you was my ground breaking procedure radical trans species ectomy .
what's that mean?
i put animal parts in you .
you put wild animals inside me?
i wish .
i don't have that kind of money .
most of the animals i used were abandoned by a mexican circus ... or came from the private zoo of a famous pop star .
why , there's mr. giggles .
he really misses the pop star .
i'm not allowed to say who .
your life is here with me now .
hmm?
look , doc , i appreciate you saving me .
thank you .
i think .
but whatever you did with the animals is working for me .
so i'm just gonna go on with my new life .
your human side may not be able to control it .
i have to go .
i have to try it .
i'm sorry .
i can't allow that .
sit .
listen up , shit stains .
i don't know how you worked that balloon trick out of the guy's ass .
i don't .
but i'm watchin 'ya .
now , the fact of the matter is , you're not even a full fledged cop yet .
you're not , okay?
and until you pass your 30 day probation ... you belong to me .
i'll have you thrown out of here so quick , it'll make your head spin .
all the best .
don't be ashamed , son .
i've eaten out of the garbage before .
yeah , this baby is nailed down tight .
not goin 'anywhere .
all righty .
one minute , okay?
give me one minute .
i'll be right back .
he was trying to get out .
you might want to get a cover for this .
yeah , maybe .
come on back .
i'll show you the animals .
this is molly .
she's a young turkey vulture .
hey , baby .
her parents were killed by a hunter ... and we're having the hardest time getting her to eat .
i'm worried she's not gonna make it .
she just misses her mom , that's all .
she doesn't eat whole worms .
that was really amazing .
so , what do you think?
it's all right .
he's nice .
there are a lot of animals in here .
yeah , i know .
it's a little crowded .
i just don't have the heart to turn any of them away .
but it's cool .
we're like one big , happy family .
this is henry , the orangutan .
he's very affectionate .
he really likes people .
he just doesn't like other monkeys .
we have quite a collection of exotic birds .
macaws and
my friend cosmo's a parrot .
you are a good boy .
parrots are one of the smartest creatures in the animal kingdom .
really?
want some food?
want a peanut?
yeah , it's been proven they have the intelligence of a five year old child .
a five year old?
people think parrots just mimic ... but i actually think they have thoughts of their own .
some of them even have a vocabulary of up to 200 words .
cosmo here has about 150 .
that's incredible .
i didn't know any of that .
hi there .
sometimes i feel like i get along better with animals than people .
animals are simple .
they're honest .
you know what i mean?
i guess i kind of like people better .
with animals , i just feel like i'm one of them .
easy , boy .
do you ever feel that way?
it's crazy .
crazy .
calm down .
what's the matter with you guys?
guys , let me ask you a serious question .
do you ever have trouble with control?
yes .
the first thing you have to do is admit you have a problem .
you have to come out and say , " i am a porn addict .
not that kind of control .
i've been having these animal urges .
me too !
i got this one crazy video on the mating rituals of a hippopotamus .
he was trying to take my meat .
hey , doc !
dr. wilder !
there you go .
tummy's all gone now .
hmm .
how is my boy?
i knew you'd come home .
i'm not " coming home .
stop it !
you're not helping .
sorry .
look , doc , you were right .
this control thing is a lot harder than i thought .
this might help .
here .
this morning , i woke up in a butcher shop .
i have no idea how i got there .
oh , i see .
the other day , i was eating out of a garbage can .
i bit someone , and then ...
i made love to a mailbox .
your subconscious is reverting to a primal state .
that's why i wanted you to stay here .
i was so sad when you left .
i thought we could be buddies .
i even gave you a name .
snowball .
i already have a name .
oh , snowball already has a name , hmm?
who's a good boy , then?
i'm a good boy .
i'm this is serious !
i'm turning into an animal here !
all right .
four whole turkeys , a dozen lamb shanks ... two salmon , my pet rabbit
oh , charlie .
one ham hock .
you see?
you didn't want the biscuit because you satisfied your hunger .
now that i have your attention , listen carefully .
you must anticipate your instincts satisfy your animal urges before they take over .
hunger will be your biggest challenge .
there's also your sex drive .
if you like , i could help you with that .
that's all right .
i'm good .
i gotta go .
there are a few things bothering me here .
i don't know how you got to the butcher shop break in before i did ... but let me guarantee you something
you had damn sure better not be trying to show me up ... with any of your super cop bullshit .
not at all , sir .
you got one week of probation left , mange ... and i'm gonna be all over you .
say " hello " to your new partner .
what's all that shit?
supplies .
i want to be prepared for anything .
of course you do .
hey , pigs .
why don't you get the hell outta here , homes?
this is our neighborhood .
you'rejust a regular bad ass , aren't you , mange?
now , when did you first notice it was missing , sir?
this morning about 5 : 30 .
i parked the tractor right here .
now it's gone .
is that your goat?
yeah , that's nellie .
she's in heat , huh?
yeah .
that's why i got her separated from the other animals .
they can't resist her .
makes sense .
makes a lot of sense .
mange , shut up .
now , are these tracks still fresh?
they are .
walk me through the whereabouts of all your farmhands at the time of the crime .
i'm gonna check out something over here .
how's it goin '?
my name's marvin .
you got it goin 'on .
gears?
all of'em .
have you noticed anything abnormal in the area of late?
control , marvin .
control .
sweetie .
yes , you make me laugh .
that's not your property?
so soft .
i'm gonna find this man
oh , my !
watch this , mange .
the professor is in .
take out your pen and take notes .
hey , guys .
ma'am ... now , i really oughta be givin 'you a ticket for bein 'too darn cute .
but i'll tell you what .
i'll settle for taking you out for a drink on saturday night .
what do you say?
maybe another time .
i already have a date ... with marvin .
right , marvin?
yeah .
i forgot .
i'm picking her up at 8 : 00?
dinner and a walk .
i'll see you then .
a walk .
i got an idea .
why don't i take you for a walk down to the women's store ... so i can get you a blouse to go along with the meter maid outfit ... you're gonna be wearing from now on , 'cause that's your new job !
get in the car !
now , this is the mayor's annual charity event .
i want you to keep a low profile .
got it?
got it .
how are my teeth?
great .
good .
that's far enough , shit stains .
i don't want you anywhere near the mayor or his guests .
you got me?
i'll be a good boy .
and for god's sake , keep your shirt on .
i would like to thank everyone here ... for the success of this fund raiser .
the fire department is going to love their new equipment .
outstanding !
hi , daddy .
hi , sweetheart .
where are you off to?
you keep an eye on him .
yes , sir .
that is one handsome little fellow .
bacon wrapped shrimp?
oh , thank you .
hey , there he is .
how are you?
i am so sorry , mr. mayor .
aren't you that drug sniffing cop?
yes , sir .
it's a fur ball .
sir , this officer's been on probation .
he obviously failed .
he's off the force as of now .
do you hear that?
you all right?
you know , you scared your old man .
wonderful !
chief , this is one fine cop you've got here .
yes , it is .
yeah .
hey , there he is .
hey , listen up !
a toast !
to the newest cop on the force , baby !
go , aquaman !
outstanding !
you're all right , man .
you're all right .
right there .
go .
so you were really able to hear that kid drowning from that far away?
yeah .
all right .
then what am i sayin 'now?
you were born with only one testicle .
you keep that shit to yourself .
i'm just worried about my date with the tree girl .
i don't know if it's gonna work out .
she's a man , isn't she?
i knew it when you met her in the men's room .
i have to tell you guys something .
i got into a terrible car crash in the mountains .
some scientist found me and put me back together with different animal parts .
now i can't control my sexual urges .
if you don't wanna hang out with me because i'm black , just let me know .
yeah .
i hope you like vegetarian .
i love it .
look at her .
and look at the disaster she's with .
they make it so easy for us .
thanks for helping me out with sergeant sisk .
no , it was no problem .
i wasn't sure if you really meant it .
of course i did .
yeah?
so , how are the animals doing over at the shelter?
i started feeling bad about the lack of space ... so i started to bring some of the animals home with me .
maybe i'm crazy .
i don't think so .
i think you're pretty amazing .
no , i'm not .
yes , you are .
you know , there's something about you , marvin .
i can not figure it out .
how is your grilled eggplant?
nice , huh?
yes , it's lovely .
thank you .
you are the lovely one .
where's the bathroom?
next to the bar .
great .
thank you .
excuse me for a second .
do you smell that?
it's kind of musty .
asparagus , next table .
oh , you have a little
oh .
i'll get it .
that was either the nicest thing that's ever happened to me ... or the grossest .
will you excuse me for a minute?
of course .
sorry .
i ordered us some sorbet .
great .
will you excuse me again , please?
there you go .
oh , thank you .
wow .
that's such a beautiful necklace you have .
thanks .
did you get that in italy?
yes , in florence .
i am from firenze .
my family lives there .
you stay with them .
i'll give you my number .
call me .
tony , i'm gonna have a smoke .
what ever happened to that waiter?
i guess he was done with his shift or something .
thanks for the walk .
no .
thank you for dinner .
it was great .
so , can i invite you in?
it's been such a perfect evening .
i'd hate to ruin it by attacking you .
well , that's honest .
so , i guess this is good night .
good night .
tomorrow , we're releasing molly the turkey vulture back into the wild .
you should come by .
i wouldn't miss it .
okay .
good night .
i've never seen anything like it .
there was blood , guts everywhere .
there was nothin 'left of that cow !
it even ate most of the hooves .
i'm tellin 'you , chief , there's some kind of a beast out there .
all the other cows are too afraid to eat or shit .
and they ain't got nothin 'else .
i'm gonna have an officer drive you home , you hear?
all i want you to do is just take care of your cows .
i'm gonna go put on a puppet show for 'em .
maybe that'll calm 'em down .
marvin .
can i see you in my office for a minute?
that was bob harris .
last night a couple of his cows got all torn up .
looks to me like it might be one of those satanic rituals .
do you worship the dark lord?
no , sir .
help yourself .
bob got a look at a man running away from the scene .
we made a composite ... from his description .
do you recall ... where you were last night between midnight and 5 : 00 a . m .?
i was sleeping , sir .
do you have ... anyone who can corroborate that?
no , sir .
can you explain why that drawing ...
looks like you , marvin?
i'm going to have to ask you to go on paid leave until we figure this out .
i'm also going to have to ask you to teach me how you do that .
sorry , dad .
is that a beaver dam?
what's happening to you?
look , you have to go .
you can trust me .
only an animal would do something like that .
there must be some other explanation .
i know you , and you wouldn't hurt anyone or anything .
it's getting late .
you can't stay here much longer .
i'm not going anywhere .
you're not dangerous ... and i'm gonna stay here tonight to prove it to you .
it's not safe .
at night , i lose control .
what are you doing?
i have no idea .
knock it off .
if you're gonna stay here , at least tie me up .
what?
i want you to tie me up ... so that i won't hurt anybody .
my handcuffs !
you looked so uncomfortable .
when did you take them off?
i don't remember .
you wore them for a while ... and then i wore them for a while .
you are an animal .
i am?
awesome !
marvin , go !
this is chiefwilson .
last night , a hunter was attacked !
mange !
we know about the barn !
marvin , you gotta get outta here !
marvin , get out !
the freak show's over .
come with me !
go !
freeze !
supercop marvin mange has turned fugitive today .
he 's wanted for the assault of a bird hunter , and the attack of two cows .
the suspect is considered dangerous ... and elkerton police chief marion wilson is assembling ... a task force of the city 's finest officers .
ladies and gentlemen ... our suspect is not human .
he is at home in the bush .
shoot to kill .
any questions?
yeah , i got a question there .
when do we get to light our torches?
when it gets dark .
i see .
i got another question there .
suppose , hypothetically , you know ... a guy had already lit his torch .
it'd be cool if he could just keep it lit , huh?
yes .
oh , excellent .
excellent .
now , if there are no more questions
i got another question .
if one part of the mob gets separated from another part of the mob ... shouldn't there be a place that we can get together?
maybe a secret place the two mobs could reunite , and we'd be a big mob again .
stay with the mob .
stay with the mob .
all right .
right .
hey !
i got another question .
doesn't this guy deserve a fair trial?
you back of the mob .
back of the mob "?
what?
this is my spot !
i came early !
okay , out of the mob !
ah , this mob blows .
let's go .
what are you doing out here?
picking apples .
with a dart gun?
i made a terrible mistake ... and now i must correct it .
there's something else out here , isn't there?
it was the same experimental procedure as yours .
i don't understand what went wrong .
we have to catch it before it's too late .
until then ... we are all in danger .
right here is exactly why black people don't go camping .
i could just as easily have something crawl up my ass at home .
i have to eat .
you need to start carrying power bars with you , 'cause this is some bullshit .
sorry , miles .
i have to eat .
oh , my god .
you scared me .
you shouldn't be out here .
there's a crazy man beast in the woods .
damn .
go .
go !
you're the only one that can stop it now .
on your left , on your left !
i love berries .
are you done yet?
you're mine !
like that , huh?
come on , baby .
mange !
what?
come on .
i got ya .
reach for it .
why did you save me?
like i told you ...
i'm not an animal .
wish i could take that chance .
you .
that hunter was after my turkey vulture .
i had to scare him off .
i guess we have the same doctor .
i hope this doesn't change anything between us .
so that's why you have six nipples .
the damn tree girl is the beast .
two beasts kissing that's hot .
kill the beast !
kill him !
kill him !
take your dirty paws off her !
it's time to die , man beast !
