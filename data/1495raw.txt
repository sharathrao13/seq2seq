i guess i would ...
well , definitely pay off my medical bills , you know .
umm ...
py the rent .
taking a vacation sounds nice tco .
why are you asking me this?
i don't know .
you know , thats a common question .
what would you do if you won the lottery? . '
yeah .
i don't have a million dollars , you know .
it's not a big issue for me now .
i'm sorry .
what is that? .
so you can buy a lottery ticket .
lcok , i don't need your pity .
i wasn't  really .
i don't need your help .
whats up , jakeem?
why you lcokin 'like that , man?
every time you come around here , you're lcokin 'depressed .
that matchbox bitch ain't giving you no pussy? .
why you keep playin ', man?
are you in or oout? .
come on , lets go .
come on , man .
fuck .
ahh !
lcok , man .
bull's eye .
i didn't come here forthis .
okay , boss , this is a job that we gotta do in the day
'cause they're not gonna expect us .
especially two humans ,
'cause they're usually guarding against vampires .
one and a half humans .
okay , you got jokes .
this is a diagram of how it's gonna get down .
this is the front gate .
this is where the first guard is .
afterthe first guard , there's gonna be two more .
how we get past the first guard?
let me finish .
once we get past these two guards here , we head to this little room .
thats where the safe is .
there might be one guard there .
i don't know .
after we get pa
when we get to the timer , we have about 60 seconds .
afterthem 60 seconds , if we take tco long , it'll alert more , so you have to be quick .
how do we get past the first guard?
tear gas .
sounds like a fuckin 'deathtrap .
thats what it is , man .
lf we use tear gas , the whole rest of the block is gonna swarm down on us .
neverthought of that one .
how are you so sure that there's three to four pecple inside?
possibly .
how do you know this?
this is what i scoped out three weeks ago .
after we get past the first guard , you don't think the rest will just rush to the froht? .
i didn't think of that one right there .
escape route?
the front dcor .
so there's no escape route .
not that i know of .
no .
i think you need to leave the plannin 'to me and ...
just let me be the boss .
okay .
'cause you don't know what the fuck you're doin '.
tend to your business , boss .
first rule ... is if we walk there and the shit dcesn't lcok right , we leave immediately .
okay .
second rule is no guns .
what the fuck you mean , " no guns "?
how we supposed to get past fourto five guards with no guns?
smile at 'em?
no guns .
all right .
just makin 'this shit harder , though .
i get there and see you with a gun , i'm walkin 'away .
okay , boss .
all right , listen .
yeah , he by hisself .
this should be very easy .
so , we ready to do this?
