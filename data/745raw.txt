good night sweat heart good night mum sleep tight kid
simulation terminated
alright mr. byrl , is it? my friends call me flame can you tell me what you did wrong?
i fell down no no before that can anyone tell me mr. byrl's big mistake? anyone
let's take a look at the tape?
see the door you let it wide open
leaving the door open is a big mistake because ... it could let in a draft ... it could let in a child there's nothing more toxic and deadly than a human child a single touch could kill you
let the door open and a child could walk into the factory right into the monster world
i won't go in the kid's room you can't make me you'll go in there cos we need this
our city's counting on you to collect those children's screams without scream we have no power it's dangerous work and that's why i need you to be at your best
i need scarers work confident tenacious , tough , intimidating
i need scarers like ...

i'm taking her to the monster truck what're you gonna do? home work out some more you know this is more than scaring can i borrow your oilmen? smelly garbage old dumpster how about wet dog? sneak it up sometimes i think i should just marry myself one of the romances ahead of me it's me and celia
i gotta tell you that face just makes my heart go ...
as a matter of fact ... and i seriously found your paper work correct for once your stunt silence is very reassuring
what am i gonna tell ... wanna get going? do i ever it's just that ...
i don't understand
i just forgot some paper work i was supposed to file
mike reminded me thanks buddy
i mean i was ok let's go then
man i have no idea
hello anyone there's a door here
anybody's scaring in here?
i've had a lot of birthdays this is the best birthday ever what're you looking at?
i was thinking the first time i laid eyes on you how pretty you looked stop it your hair is shorter
i'm thinking about getting it cut no i like it this length
i like everything about you just the other day someone asked me who was the most beautiful monster you know what said? what did you say?
i said ...
sulli that's not what i was gonna say you're making sense what a coincidence running into you
i'm just gonna order something to go what's good here? get out of here you're ruining our day back in there for your paper work there was a door what?
randall was in it wait a minute that cheater he is trying to boost his numbers something else what?

i have to ... on three .
1 , ...
there's a kid here a human kid
come on
let get out of here
stop pushing get your hands off my ...
i don't think that'd have gone any worse
there has been a child security breach for the first in monsters history
i was trying to run and they tried to shoot me like a dog
i saw the whole thing it's my professional opinion it's time to ...
it's coming
don't touch those you little it doesn't come near us it's gonna be ok
you like this? catch that's it no one touches little mike give her the bear
sulli make it stop nice bear
please stop crying right now good keep it up you're doing great
what was that?
i have no idea but it'd be really great if it didn't do it again
what can i do?
i'm being so stupid it'd destroy the company what about us that thing is a killing machine
i better wait till it falls asleep and then whap !
i think i have a plan here we dig a tunnel under the city and release it into the wide that's it
i've run out of ideas closed
i think she's getting tired why don't you find someplace for her to sleep while i think of a plan you sleepy is that what you want?
that's my bed you're gonna get your germs all over
that's the closet we're going to sleep that looks like randall
randall's a monster you think he's coming in the closet and scare you how am i gonna explain this? it's empty see no monster in here
on no there is
i'm gonna scare you
i'm off duty
i'll sit in here till you fall asleep good now go to sleep
you go to sleep
it might sound crazy but i don't think that kid's dangerous
i always wanted a pet to kill me what if we just put her back in the door? think about it
like it's never happened everything goes back to normal is that a joke tell me you're joking giving us a circumstance i've been extremely up to now it's a horrible idea what are we gonna do?
then we just walk right back to the factory right?
i'm not gonna fool anyone think about a few things they all got one thing in common don't worry we can do this everything is going to be ok
don't panic
that's the number one concern not now hello little one where do you come from?
isn't this one yours? that's my cousin sister's daughter
james why don't you stop by for the simulation today and give us scares you talked about that day yes i'm coming see you this afternoon
the scare demonstration why am i the last to know?
hold it stop
come on it's clear all we have to do is get rid of that thing this is the man's room that's the weirdest thing you have ever said it's fine it loves it here it's dancing with joy
i'll be right back with the door key what a cute little dance you got
are you done in there?
sorry

i'm getting warming any second now what are you doing?
i am looking for the kid you lost it? no she was just ... here she is what's the matter?
what're we gonna do about the child
the front page the child the one you ... don't you think i am aware of this situation
i was up all night to find it
i did a calculation the child may have escaped
i just wanna make sure we're acting
like nothing's happened you just get the machine up and running
i'll take care of the kid if i find them they are dead why are you still here come on go move
this is so very bad they were talking about a machine we don't panic
did you lose weight? you have the car key right? of course i got her car key and now i have the car key
try to take care of yourself
it's not her door what are you talking about? of course it's her door no her door was white it had flowers on it it must have been dark cos it's its door you hear that sounds like un in there send me a post card kid
bon voyage see the snack go get the snack this is boo's door? what's boo? that's what i decided to call her you're not supposed to call it cos once you name it you're starting to get attached to it now put that thing back where it came from
we're rehearsing a play called now put that thing back where it came from or so help me it's a musical
we're still working on it it's a working progress now say goodbye to it where'd it go? where is she?
i don't believe it she's away from you again wait a minute the sun is coming up it's perfect she is gone where are you going we're so close to breaking the record it's their problem not ours what are you doing? they were rehearsing a play
so what do you think of that kid getting out? yeah crazy you haven't seen anything have you? no way but it was an inside job

how could this happened?
how could this happened?
does anyone else know about this?
no , sir .
good .
this company can't afford anymore bad publicity .
now , before we go anything else , let's take care of the child .
i've never thought that things will come to this .
not in my factory .
i'm sorry that you boys got mixed up in this .
especially you , james .

no !
boo !
it's too late !
we are banished , genius !
we are in the human world !
what a great idea going to your pal waternoose .
too bad he's in the whole thing .
all you have to do was to listen to me ... just once !
but you didn't , didn't you?
welcome to the himalayas !
how vulnerable .
can you believe that , do i look like vulnerable to you?
why can't they call me the adorable snowman , or the agreeable snowman , for crying out loud?
i'm a nice guy .
snow cone?
don't worry .
it's lemon .
how about you big fellow?
snow cone?
did you see the way that she looked at me?
poor guy .
i understand .
it ain't easy being banished .
take my buddy big foot .
when he was banished ... he fasted into an enormous diarrhea out of poison lvy .
all out of his head like a tear .
there won't be so hard for you guys .
you know , i mean how lucky can you get?
banished with your best friend .
he's not my friend .
i just assumed that you are buddies .
you know , when i saw you guys out there in the snow hugging and all that ...
look at that big jerk ruining my life and for what?
a stupid kid .
because of you , i'm now stuck in this frozen waste land .
waste land?
i think you mean wonderland .
i mean how about all this fabulous snow .
and wait till you see the local villagers .
cutest thing in the world .
i haven't even mentioned all the fury yak's smell .

you know once you pick the hairs out it's very nutritious .
no , no .
something about a village .

are there kids in it?
kids?

soft kids .
sissy kids .

we would have it made !
none of it matters now .
none of it matters?
wait a second?
none of it matters? !
okay .
i have said no .
good .
great .
so now the truth comes out , doesn't it?
would you look at that , we are out of snow cone?
let me just go outside and make some more .
so , what about everything that we ever work for?
does that matter?
what about celia?
i am never ... never going to see her again .
doesn't that matter?
what about me?
i'm your pal .
i'm your best friend .
don't i matter?
i'm sorry , mike .
i'm sorry that we stuck out here .
i didn't mean for this to happen .
but boo is in trouble .
i think that maybe a way to save her .
but we can just get down ...

lf you want to go out there and freeze to death , you be my guest .
because you are on your own .

mike , you don't understand .
yes , i do .
i was just mad , that's all .
i needed some time to think .
but you shouldn't have left me out there .
i'm being attacked .
no , i'm not attacking you .
i'm trying to be honest .
just hear me out .
look , you and i are a team .
that's more important than our friendship .
i know , kid .
he's too sensitive .
come on , pal .
lf you start crying , i start crying .
i'll never get through this .
i'm sorry that i wasn't there .
but i am now .
