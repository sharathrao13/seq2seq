another world , another time .
in the age of wonder .
a thousand years ago , this land was green , until the crystal cracked .
a single piece was lost , a shard of the crystal .
then strife began , and two new races appeared .
the cruel skeksis , the gentle mystics .
here in the castle of the crystal , the skeksis took control .
now the skeksis gather in the sacred chamber .
where the crystal hangs above a shaft of air and fire .
the skeksis with their hard , twisted bodies , their harsh , twisted wills .
for a thousand years they have ruled .
yet now there are only ten .
a dying race , ruled by a dying emperor .
imprisoned within themselves in a dying land .
once more they gather at the crystal .
as the first sun climbs to its peak .
as the skeksis ravage the land , they draw new life from the sun .
once more they will replenish themselves .
through the power of their source , their treasure , their fate ...
the dark crystal .
but today , the sun ceremony gives no comfort .
an emperor lies dying .
today , a new emperor must seize the throne .
a thousand years ago , the crystal cracked .
here , far from the castle .
the race of mystics came to live in a dream of peace .
their ways were the gentle ways of natural wizards .
yet now there are only ten .
a dying race .
numbly rehearsing the ancient ways in a blur of forgetfulness .
but today , the ritual gives no comfort .
today , the wisest of the mystics lies dying .
today , they summon the one who must save them .
in the valley of the mystics there lives a gelfling , jen .
the skeksis killed his family and destroyed his clan .
only jen survived , to be raised by the wisest of the mystics .
but there is a prophecy ...
a thousand years have passed .
now , once more , the world must undergo a time of testing .
now it must be healed , or pass forever into the rule of evil .
at this time , jen is the chosen one .
today , jen's pipe gives no comfort .
for today , his master lies dying .
and a journey must begin ... the journey of jen .
master?
when the three suns meet ...
master , what's wrong?
you are in danger , gelfling .
and i must leave you .
leave me?
master , no .
i have told you of the skeksis .
the skeksis killed my mother and father .
the story runs deeper than you know .
and you are part of it .
i don't understand .
the skeksis will vow to destroy you .
for the prophecy says you must find the shard .
the crystal shard .
the crystal shard?
to save our world , you must find the shard ... ... before the three suns meet .
if not , skeksis rule forever .
where is it?
aughra holds the shard .
follow the greater sun for a day to the home of aughra .
she knows all the secrets .
aughra?
follow the greater sun?
but i'm only a gelfling .
i should have told you these things long ago .
now it is up to you .
remember me , jen .
we may meet in another life ... ... but not again in this one .
master !
don't leave me .
i hate your whimper .
quiet !
he's not dead yet , my lord chamberlain .
kneel !
bow !
i ...
i am still in power .
i ...
i'll go where you send me ... ... though i barely understand .
dear friend , be well .
receive your belongings , receive them serenely .
now we send forth jen .
watch over his dangerous quest .
dear master , i'll find the shard .
i'm not ready to go alone .
all right , alone then .
the emperor is dead .
which one of us will be the new emperor?
my lord chamberlain , time to choose an emperor .
it should be me .
not him !
i must rule !
you should be the emperor .
there's going to be a fight .
it's time to make my move .
it's me .
we're all with you .
chamberlain , wait !
you can't !
get back , spithead !
lay down my sceptre !
i challenge !
trial by stone .
trial by stone !
trial by stone .
slaves , quick , the stone .
pull !
pull !
you whimpering worm .
that did it !
he can't beat that .
he's really mad now .
me !
the emperor !
now , by the law , he must pay .
stop !
yes .
let him go !
the chamberlain is banished .
now , bow down to me !
i am emperor !
hail to the new emperor !
listen , the crystal .
the crystal calls .
to the crystal chamber .
a gelfling alive?
a gelfling !
the prophecy .
the prophecy says gelfling will destroy us .
no !
garthim , attack !
garthim soldiers , find the gelfling .
the gelfling , bring him to the castle .
garthim , death to gelfling .
ugly , hideous gelfling .
what in the world ...?
this place is weird .
let's see ... her name is aughra .
follow the greater sun for a day to the home of aughra .
some directions .
who is aughra , anyway?
one of these things?
maybe she murders gelflings .
what am i doing here?
a gelfling !
are you a gelfling?
yes .
my name is jen .
they killed all the gelfling .
you can't be a gelfling .
you look and smell like a gelfling .
maybe you are a gelfling .
i'm looking for aughra .
who sent you?
my master , wisest of the mystics .
where is he?
he's dead .
he could be anywhere then .
are you aughra?
are you afraid of me?
do you think i'm going to eat you?
what do you want of me?
a crystal shard .
is that all , a crystal shard?
drop him .
aughra?
aughra?
what's it for?
is that what you want to know?
what is this all about?
you don't know?
everything in the heavens is here .
moving ... as the heavens move .
this is how to know when ... that's what .
suns , moons , stars ...
yes , the angle of eternity .
that's how i know it's coming .
how else can i make the prediction?
a thousand years ago , there was a great conjunction .
i was there .
three suns lined up .
the crystal cracked , and the skeksis and mystics appeared .
another great conjunction is coming .
anything could happen .
the whole world might burn up .
the end of aughra .
you'd better have your shard before that gelfling .
ask what the great conjunction is .
what's the great conjunction?
you tell me .
the great conjunction is the end of the world ... or the beginning .
end , begin ... all the same .
big change .
sometimes good , sometimes bad .
there it is !
gelfling knows nothing .
what do i do with the shard?
heal the dark crystal .
but how?
questions , questions !
you want a shard?
here .
which one is it?
don't know .
don't know .
there is much to be learned ... ... and you have no time .
which one is it?
it's one of these three , i'm sure .
you're taking too long .
hurry !
but how do i choose?
yes !
now that you have it , you don't know what to do with it .
but aughra knows .
garthim !
out !
get out !
get out !
aughra !
at last , the crystal calls .
it is time to return to the castle .
now i've got the shard ... but what do i do with it?
what is it?
am i supposed to take it somewhere?
what's so special about this shard?
it doesn't look like ...
i don't like this .
oh no !
right in the mud !
fizzgig !
you are a gelfling like me .
yes .
i thought i was the only one .
i thought i was .
here , i'll help you out .
here , i'll help you out .
the first thing i remember is fire .
it's a war , i think .
a tree .
my mother puts me inside .
mother !
the kind one picks me up .
he makes the monsters disappear , and i be safe .
what's happening?
we're dream fasting .
sharing our memories .
i'm having a bath .
my new mom called me kira .
master showed me the whole valley stretching out .
the garthim captured the podlings .
master is my family , teacher and friend .
i talk with the flowers and all the living things .
he shows me numbers and words .
everywhere i go i find kindness .
i learn from them all , but there's no one here like me .
i love them all , except i need to find ...
wait !
it's going away .
i'm sinking .
don't move .
don't move?
where would i go?
what is that?
just a nebrey .
she won't hurt you .
kira !
your name is kira .
we were dream fasted , you and i.
fizzgig , come on .
this is jen .
fizzgig !
you seem strange to him .
he seems strange to me .
he's nervous .
skeksis are watching .
we must go .
roast nebrey , my favourite .
i want the rare piece .
you slimefish !
rotten !
it seems to me that gelfling has escaped .
no gelfling ever escaped from my deadly garthim .
more food !
dessert !
not bad at all .
look , the garthim return .
the gelfling .
release the gelfling .
skeksis fools !
what do you want with me?
this is no gelfling !
of course i'm no gelfling .
you putrid lizards !
i'll get my eye to you .
she was with him .
where is he?
he's gone .
stupid garthim !
if you want the gelfling , ask me .
don't send crab brained soldiers .
they burned my home .
my home's gone , the gelfling's gone .
dangle and strangle to death !
watch your tongue .
we are lords of the crystal .
lords?
not for long .
what about the prophecy
that a gelfling will end skeksis power?
he'll come , make you crawl like the worms you are .
find that gelfling !
crystal bats , fly !
search the land , the water and the sky .
get down .
that was a crystal bat .
what they see , the skeksis see , too .
did it see us?
no , i don't think so .
aren't these the people from your memory?
when the garthim killed my parents , the podlings adopted me .
this is jen ...
come .
how do you say " thank you "?
the three suns in the sky are going to come together soon .
it's called the great ... the great something or other .
he told me i must find the shard before then , and that's all .
then he died .
what's the shard for?
i don't know .
i found the shard ...
but you don't know what it's for .
jen , this way .
through here .
hurry .
what was that creature?
skeksis .
wait !
they won't find us here .
it's all my fault .
that skeksis ...
he saved us from his own garthim .
first aughra's , then your village .
i wish i'd never found this shard .
no , jen !
they hurt your arm .
here , this moss will make it better .
it wasn't your fault .
the garthim have always come .
master , i remember the valley .
i didn't understand .
i miss the other masters with the old magic and chants .
out here in the world , look at me ...
i'm not a hero , not the way you wanted .
nothing is simple anymore .
master ...
where are we?
safe .
safe?
i don't think anywhere is safe anymore .
these are ruins .
they're the houses of the old ones .
you mean our ancestors?
jen , here's the shard .
i can feel something ... hear it almost .
we don't go in here anymore .
bad things happened in here once .
but they were gelfling , like us .
they were all killed by the skeksis long ago .
kira .
look here .
that looks just like the shard .
what does it mean?
what are those funny marks?
this is all writing .
what's writing?
words that stay , my master said .
when single shines the triple sun .
what was sundered and undone shall be whole .
the two made one by gelfling hand or else by none .
by gelfling hand , do you know what that means?
wait !
this is a piece of the dark crystal .
then that's what my master meant .
you have to heal the dark crystal .
prophecy !
stay ...
i'm a friend .
stay .
the prophecy caused all this trouble .
that prophecy?
is that why skeksis killed gelfling?
yes !
a bad mistake .
skeksis were afraid , feared of gelfling .
but you're a skeksis .
i saved you from the garthim .
why?
don't listen to him .
it's a trick .
no , please .
listen .
i'm an outcast .
if i make peace , i'm an outcast no more .
will you stop the garthim attacks?
yes .
please , come to the castle .
show them you want peace .
show them gelflings mean no harm .
please , please , please ...
jen , no !
please , please ...
yes .
no !
come on , kira !
wait , please .
please , wait !
please make peace !
i have to get to the castle .
i'll show you the way .
over here .
what's that?
it's a landstrider .
how did you learn to call them?
the podlings taught me .
don't be afraid .
let's go .
they'll take us .
kira , you don't have to go .
i know .
all right , together then .
no , fizzgig , you stay here .
all right , come on .
hang on , they go fast .
the prophecy didn't mention this .
prophets don't know everything .
silence , animals .
you're next , little podling .
this won't hurt , we just want to drain your living essence .
then you can be the same as the other podlings here ... a slave .
open the wall .
now , podling .
there is the shaft of the castle .
position the reflector .
the reflector will capture the beams of the dark crystal .
lock into the reflector .
feel the power of the dark crystal .
now the beam will rid you of your fears , your thoughts ... ... your vital essence .
you're very lucky .
only the emperor can drink your essence .
he is here .
close it .
is it ready?
fresh and strong , sire .
it will make you young again .
yes , young !
you fraud !
liar !
slave squeezer !
it always worked better when we used gelflings .
look !
the ones who raided your village .
let's go .
kira !
come on .
are you all right?
yes .
we've got to get them out .
hurry !
hang on .
wings !
i don't have wings .
of course not .
you're a boy .
fizzgig ...
a way into the castle .
this must lead into the lower part .
i don't want to go in there .
we have to go on .
fizzgig , come on .
careful .
which way now?
i want to go back .
i smell death here .
i know , but we have no choice .
skeksis !
i knew you would come .
do not be afraid .
i am here to help you .
come , show them we can live together in peace .
let go .
my hand !
so , my hand .
gelfling , you'll die .
let go of me .
jen !
let go .
gelfling , come on .
fizzgig , stay with jen .
let go !
let go of me !
jen !
chamberlain , get out .
gelfling !
gelfling !
come and look , such an ugly monster .
royal sire , i bring you gelfling .
i have caught her .
i bring you the gelfling .
i was wounded .
i suffered horrible pain .
a live gelfling .
we are sworn to kill all gelfling .
no , she's mine .
sire , you could drink her essence .
because of the prophecy , we must kill the gelfling .
first we take her essence , then kill .
drain her first .
take her essence .
drain her essence .
as for the whimpering chamberlain , return his robes to him .
silence , animals .
there !
yes !
yes , essence of gelfling .
kira , fight them .
fight them .
jen .
call the animals .
you have the gift to call them to freedom .
quiet , gelfling .
quiet , all of you !
stop !
gelfling , free them .
stop , all of you !
get down !
no !
too late , gelfling .
the great conjunction is at hand .
now the skeksis will have power over the stars .
when is the conjunction?
soon the three suns touch .
jen !
go , gelfling .
i fear to death .
get down .
quiet .
a big help you've been .
oh no !
now where am i?
garthim !
is that the crystal?
aughra !
you're alive .
no time !
single shines the triple sun .
where's kira?
the great conjunction comes .
yes !
the crystal !
the dark crystal .
the three suns .
the shard .
kira !
the great conjunction comes .
now we will live forever .
we will live forever !
we will live forever !
gelfling !
fizzgig , down .
kill her !
she will destroy us .
gelfling , you will die .
more gelfling .
garthim !
no !
the shard !
the shard is mine !
fizzgig !
she has the shard .
take it from her .
watch out , kira !
behind you !
leave her alone .
just give us the shard .
yes , just don't harm her .
no , jen .
heal the crystal .
kira !
jen ...
kira ...
how did you get up there?
come on then .
what was sundered and undone shall be whole .
the two made one .
now the prophecy is fulfilled .
we are again one .
many ages ago , in our arrogance and delusion .
we shattered the pure crystal .
and our world split apart .
your courage and sacrifice have made us whole
and restored the true power of the crystal .
hold her to you .
she is part of you .
as we all are part of each other .
now we leave you the crystal of truth .
make your world in its light .
