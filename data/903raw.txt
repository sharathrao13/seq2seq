would you kindly lower your tone , please?
yes , sir .
i run this show , general .
if anything screws up , it's my ass in the mower .
i deserve to be notifed of any changes that are made .
nobody's arguing that with you .
look , i caught his show on the isle of crete , and this guy is funny .
i damn near busted a gut laughin 'at him .
and the troops , they love him .
this is a tempest in a teacup ... much ado about nothing .
for crying out loud , man , this isn't brain surgery .
don't get crazy over this , dick .
we're only talking about a damn deejay .
sir , there is no such thing as " only " any more .
not now .
not in saigon .
lieutenant steven hauk is our immediate supervisor .
he's a little goofy , but he's okay .
sergeant major dickerson that's another story altogether .
he was a commander of an elite special forces unit .
he came to us because of " prostrate " problems ... and some sort of social infection that doesn't go away .
plus , i think he got shot in the ass , but i can't confirm that .
anyway , he's the man that you don't want to aggravate .
ed , are you always this happy?
cronauer !
sir !
at ease .
i'm general taylor .
hiya , general .
a real pleasure .
listen , if you have any problems here now , you come see me .
i'm the tallest hog in the trough around here .
garlick , have you put on some weight?
i don't think so , sir .
why , son , the shadow of your ass'd weigh 20 pounds .
i'll work on that , sir .
you're not supposed to address the general saying " hiya .
what's that , a new rule?
no , old rule .
that's lieutenant hauk in there .
who's the guy with the ears?
how're you doin '?
you could fly to guam with those .
uh , airman cronauer , sir .
you know , i it wouldn't kill you people to salute me once in a while .
sorry .
thanks .
i understand you're pretty funny as a deejay , and ... well , comedy is a kind of hobby of mine .
well well , actually , it's a little more than just a hobby .
reader's digest is considering publishing two of my jokes .
really?
yeah .
and perhaps some night we could maybe get together and swap humorous stories for for fun .
oh , why not?
maybe play a couple of tennessee ernie ford records .
that'd be a hoot .
that's a joke , right?
maybe .
i get it .
where is this man's paperwork?
right here , sergeant .
thank you , sir .
united states air force .
the hat does give you away .
this is not military issue , airman .
what sort of uniform is that?
cretan camouflage .
if you want to blend into a crowd of drunken greeks , there's nothin 'better .
that is humour .
i recognize that .
i also recognize your species of soldier .
i had a guy like you in the field one time .
he blew himself to pieces .
but not before his humour cost the lives of three very fine individuals .
i hope  you shut your fuckin 'hole !
you're in southeast asia now , pal .
you got your cushy little assignment .
there's nothin 'i can do about that .
in time , you will make me forget it .
you stay out of my way , there'll be no problem .
but if you toy with me , i'll burn you so bad ... you'll wish you died as a child .
am i being fairly clear?
yes , sir .
sir "?
i work for a living , airman .

well , i was it just comes up .
i was trying to be funny .
funny is good .
funny is good .
yeah .
but then do it by using comedy and humour ... not police action and coffee remarks .

edward , stay with me on this .

basically , we talk , " hey , man , what's happening?
ahh , you look hip today .
slip me some skin .
now , if someone in america comes up and says , " hey , slip me some skin , " don't be afraid .
they're not a leper , and they're not gonna go
no .
it means , " hey , baby , slip me some skin . " it's a greeting .
it's like , " how're you doin '?
nice to meet you .
slip me some skin .
now , here's how you do it .
you say , " slip me some skin .
put your hand out there .
then you go , " yeah , there's some skin .

yeah !
then you say , " groovy .
yeah .
say that .
groovy .
yes !
baby !
if something's really nice , you say , " it's groovy .
doesn't mean you're going like , " yo ! " no .
it means " groovy .
try that one .
say , " hey , baby , what's happening?

comin 'your way !
what the hell was that?
crappy weather , shitty weather?
comedy , sir .

this is not comedy .
comedy is fun , it's antics , hysterical type things .
hysterical type things?
airman cronauer requesting you to elaborate , sir .
antics , damn it .
comedy of errors , like the keystone cops falling down .
general wackiness like that .
falling down , that's a sight gag .
how would anyone see you fall down on the radio , sir?
no , no , no , no .
not literally falling down .
definitely wouldn't worth on the radio , sir .
see , sir?
what i mean is in the spirit of the keystone cops .
sir , it wouldn't worth , i don't think , i don't think anybody would see you fall through a radio , sir .
i i i i if a field radio  what are you doing here?
well , i thought i'd come and help smooth things out  don't help and don't smooth .
and you you are not funny , but you are a maniac ... and you'd better start changing your life .

adrian cronauer , gls , a wacky and welcome addition ...
to afrs , radio saigon .
nixon's press conference .

he's this far from sincerity .
uh , no , man , listen .
let me just feed my face .
just a moment .
come on .
where do you imagine you're going?
just gonna get a little somethin 'to eat .
you don't have time .
you'll stay here and drink instant beverage or something .
we promised our listening audience nixon highlights by 4 : oo p . m .
i've been on the air for four hours .
i'm a little hungry .
that's a joke , right?
i get it .
no , i'm actually hungry .
well , i'm actually giving you an order .
oh , it's an order .
in that case , gentlemen , let's edit .
thank you .
mm mmm , campbell's .
aha !
ha !
earl !
ha , you again .
no more fighting , okay?
oh , you got it .
james !
nice , shiny green suit .
you look like an oriental leprechaun .
you like it?
i got it in hong kong ... home of the shiny green suit .
and therefore , there is no place for neutrality ... or a neutralist sentiment in south vietnam .
as i leave vietnam today , there is no doubt , certainly , in my mind ...
that's nixon . but that the viet cong will be defeated ... and that this war will be won .
asia does involve , i think , very appropriately as you have suggested , give and take .
well , i really didn't make that suggestion , sir i'm sorry ,
the united states has no right to give .
why would cronauer's voice be on this tape?
i don't know , lieutenant . ... its territory to the communists ,
mr nixon , thank you for that concise political commentary ... but i think i'd like to delve into something slightly more personal for the men in the field .
how would you describe your testicles?
that they're soft , that they're shallow , that they have no purpose , oh , my god .
what are you saying , sir?
oh , my god .
that they lack the physical strength .
how would you describe your sex life with your wife pat?
uh , it is unexciting sometimes .
well , have you considered possibly a sex change?
there is an operation that can transform you ...
please don't do this to me .
please don't do this to me . into a female great dane or possibly a very well hung chihuahua .
mr nixon , while you've been in vietnam , it's rumoured that you smoked marijuana .
are you planning , sir , to take some of the mariruana home , back to the united states?
how would you do that?
by plane ... by helicopter and also by automobile .
i was wondering if you could do your mr ed , because i know people love that .
cut that thing off .
i said cut it off !
sir .
where is cronauer?
still eating , sir .
i want to see him asap .
what , sir?
as soon as possible .
vg , sir .
we interrupt this broadcast ... to bring you an emergency selection of the benny goodman orchestra .
we simply need to consider taking him of off the air
lieutenant , we get hundreds , maybe thousands of calls and letters each week , fan mail
he's the first man in the history of armed forces radio to get fan mail .
every gi in this country is glued to his radio twice a day ... at o6 : oo hours and 16 : oo hours to hear that lunatic .
sir , the man has got an irreverent tendency .
he did a very off colour parody of former vp nixon .
i thought it was hilarious .
respectfully , sir ... the former v. p. is a good man and a decent man .
bullshit !
i know nixon personally .
he lugs a trainload of shit behind him that would fertilize the sinai .
why , i wouldn't buy an apple from the son of a bitch , and i consider him a good , close , personal friend .
let's get down to business here , general .
what the hell's goin 'on here?
we've got a mounting crisis in this country .
we've got a deejay that the men dearly love .
if you two have personal problems , solve them , will you?
thank you , lieutenant .
thank you , lieutenant !
speak your piece , dick .
due respect , sir .
i have over 15 years command experience in this army .
do you really expect me to run this radio station with nothin 'to say and no way to do it?
right now , yes .

if this is a legitimate news story , it must go through proper channels .
listen , tweedle dee , it's an actual event .
where do you think this came from , shaving?
it's the truth .
i just want to report the truth .
it'd be a nice change of pace .
what's goin 'on here?
sir , will you listen to me?
this is not official news , airman .
as far as i'm concerned , it didn't happen .
it did happen and i was  you shut your mouth .
what are you afraid of , dickerson?
people might find out there's a war goin 'on?
this news is not official , airman .
you want everyone going under the assumption it's perfectly safe here , don't you?
well , it's not .
the fighting's not just in the hills .
it's downtown .
it's a couple of fuckin 'blocks
i said it is none of your goddam business !
i see your point .
i'm sorry .
i guess i get inside , hit these air conditioners , i get a little dizzy .

adrian cronauer
good morning , vietnam !
hey , i know it's not the morning , but that's my trademark ... and " good evening " sounds too depressing ,
hey , we're goin 'right now to the news .
from england , today , princess margaret threw a shoe !
easy , madge .
also , uh , elizab queen elizabeth , liz elizabeth taylor !
elizabeth taylor .
she's still married after six months .
way to go , liz .
yea !
all right !
in saigon today , according to official sources ... nothing actually happened .
one thing that didn't officially happen was a bomb didn't officially explode at 14 : 3o hours ... unofficially destroying jimmy wah's cafe .
get him out of there .
three men were unofficially wounded , and two men ...
whose identities are still not known at this time are unofficially dead it's locked !
well , break the goddam door down !
although the police , ambulance and fire department responded ... what's believed to be unofficial at this present moment .
turn the power of in that studio .
but his show is  turn it off !
now !
i just wanted to think that you should
the man should be court martialed , sir .
you think this is the most serious set of affairs i have to address this week?
well , it's not .
i can't believe you're gonna pass on this , general .
the man is a goddamned subversive .
he made a mistake , dick .
mistake , sir?
i don't want to be around when he broadcasts us troop movements to the other side .
i run the station according to strict guidelines set by military intelligence .
military intelligence?
there's a contradiction in terms .
sir , the man is a walking keg of dynamite .
in the eight weeks he's been on the air , general , he's disobeyed orders as to style and content
he's read unofficial news .
what's he gonna be like in six months?
what's he gonna be like when he's ten times as popular , general?
how easy is it gonna be to get him off the air then?
who'll do the cronauer show?
well , hauk can do it , sir , till i find a replacement .
okay , for now , suspend him .
sir , you've made the correct choice .
right here , right here on our show , diana ross and the " suprawns .
set me free why don't you , babe
set me free why don't you , babe
you don't really need me you just keep me steamin'on

larry , pisces .

what'd he say?
he say you drink too much already .
well , tell him i drink so i can be this funny .
it's not funny at all , he said .
tell him thanks .
it's nice to bomb in another language .
you will get sick if you drink some more .
come on .
my village not too far from here .
you could come there for resting .
you could see how we live .
listen , sparky , i don't think seeing your little production of our town is gonna cheer me up
you see trinh there .
i'll drive .
red leather , yellow leather .
red led
red red leather , yellow leather .
red leather , yellow leather  sir , sir
reading the news is one thing , but this stuff you wrote , i 'it's not funny , sir it's sad
sir?
i'm begging you , don't try to do comedy , it's not in your blood
i'll do fine , comedy is what you make it ,
i've got pages and pages of great material .
right , abersold?
i'm afraid you're gonna be hittin 'bottom , sir .
if it isn't funny , then why did i hear you laughing when you typed it?
i was thinking of something else ,
thank you for your support .
now i've got a show to do .
sir , you're not funny , ask around
ask me .
sir , with all due respect ... uh , uh , i think you're gonna you might lay an egg i mean a big egg .
i mean , i know funny , and i don't think you're it , but hey , such is life .
me , i'm not much with power tools .
hey , that was the great , exciting sound of petula clark .
beach boys .
those were guys .
of the beach boys ,
hey , that wraps it up for me , marty lee dreiwitz .
adrian cronauer is on temporary assignment ... but boy , do i have a surprise for you .
don't build him up .
you'll only let 'em down .
please welcome to the microphone ... the lieutenant of laughs , the officer of oral , the westmoreland of wit ... swingin 'steven hauh !
hello , vietnam , and greetings ,
soon , the news , then
lieutenant steve !
lieutenant steve !
who's that?
it's me, your old pal frenchy ,
listen , frenchy , let me ask you something .
do you like good food?
oh , but of course .
uh , the french love good food .
well , then , i guess that would make you an " eatie gourmet .
oh , ho , ho , ho , lieutenant steve .
oh , frenchy .
" oh , ho , ho , lieutenant steve .
frenchy .
you know , i really shouldn't kid frenchy ... because sometimes he " stan getz " mad at me ... and he could " al hirt " me .
uh , lieutenant steve , let's play some music .
okay , frenchy .
what would you like to hear?
well , uh , i love a good polka as much as the next man .
well , a good polka it is for my good friend frenchy .
i think some apologies are in order .
you're not gonna continue this broadcast , are you , sir?
what are they doing?
oh , they're buddhists .
they're sitting for peace , wisdom and knowledge .
they're waiting for enlightenment .
this man lose one son from blasting american mine .
his father and brother was killed by french long ago .
i think it's not fair to him .
look .
he's going , " no big deal . " look .
how lovin 'can you feel when you got that moment when
don't you know that the time can be that away , warka wack wacka wack , wacka wack
and don't you know that it ain't gonna be and you feel that the time you see
and it all wacka wack wacka wacka , wacka wacka i know and i'm movin '
look .
up there .
pull .
pull .
you not understand .
you not .
we no future together , " cronow .
my country , maybe no future .
hey , i like you .
i just want to be your friend , okay?
i know it sounds dumb .
i i not can do this , " cronow .
no .
no friend , " cronow .
not good for , for me .
my brother , okay , friends .
but vietnam ladies not friends .
please .
okay?
not friends .
great week .
that's about as good a polka as you'll ever hear .
you want cronauer back on the air .
we've gotten duffel bags filled with information asking for cronauer's reinstatement .
the men all hate hauk .
they want cronauer back .
he's an exhilarating personality , and polkas are just no substitute .
i think i see a pattern forming here .
sir , these letters are unequivocal .
uh , e . g .
hey , hauk , eat a bag of shit .
you suck .
that's pretty much to the point , sir .
not much grey area in this one .
we got one positive call from some guy in wichita who thought hauk's comedy was visionary and interesting .
the other 1, 1oo calls said that the man can't do comedy to save his dick .
that's a direct quote , sir .
i've taken 9o calls this morning .
they just don't like hauk .
captain hauk sucks the sweat off a dead man's balls .
i have no idea what that means , sir , but it seems very negative to me .
i think the troops are tryin 'to tell us somethin ', fellas .
sir , if it is my programming choices , i can change .
i've been broadcasting the polkas because i thought a certain segment of the men ... weren't represented by cronauer's broadcasts of rock and roll .
but i can easily play an occasional gay lewis record .
it doesn't make a damn whether you play polkas or don't play polkas .
military politics .
nothing personal .
the men just like him better than they do you .
he maliciously and with purposeful intent read unofficial news .
no , no , no , no .
he made a mistake .
we all make mistakes .
now this thing is a delicate balance over here ... and i don't want it dependent on a disc jockey .
the men want him back , i want him back .
sir , you heard from the men who don't like my humour , but what about the silent masses who do? .
and as far as polkas , they are a much maligned musical taste .
lieutenant , you don't know whether you're shot , fucked , powder burned or snake bit .
i don't care about polkas .
they're rioting in hue .
we're bringin 'in thousands of troops every month .
terrorism's on the uprise in saigon .
the problems of this country have not one goddamned thing to do with ... whether you play polkas or don't play polkas .
the men want him back .
i want him back .
reinstate the man .
sir , in my heart ...
i know i'm funny .
thank you , lieutenant .
there you are , sir .
please don't call me " sir .
it just came down the pike .
you're back on the air , sir .
i'm not goin 'on .
what do you mean you're not goin 'on?
if you don't understand what i said , maybe you should take my english class .
i'm not goin 'on .
you're a very attractive man , abersold .
don't think i haven't noticed .
you'll be bored , you know .
what are you gonna do with your time?
i don't know .
i may go downtown , look for a vietnamese man named phil .
or i may just stay here and listen to old pat boone records .
try and find some hidden meaning 'cause basically i believe that that man is a misunderstood genius .
genius .
what are you saying to me?
i'm sayin 'i'm through , ed .
i'm tired of people tellin 'me what i can't say .
this news isn't official .
that comment is too sarcastic .
i can't even make fun of richard nixon , and there's a man who's screaming out to be made fun of .
so fuck it .
sorry .
is he all right?
no , phil , he's not all right .
a man does not refer to pat boone as a beautiful genius if things are all right .
sir .
garlick?
i'd like you to collate these one minute spots prior to broadcast .
you have a problem with that , young man?
absolutely not .
i live to collate , sir .

edward .
i'd like an explanation .
on anything in particular?
a lot of people went to the mat for you .
thousands of guys wrote in , called in , tryin 'to get you reinstated .
and i literally think that you owe it to all of them to get your ass back on the air .
if you haven't noticed , the army doesn't really want me , ed .
they've been harassing me since the day i got of the plane .
so what?
it's the guys in the field that matter , remember?
those are the guys that are dyin '.
edward , i tried to tell the truth , and they kicked me of the air .
i screw up once more , dickerson sends me into the field with a rifle .
i come home in a box .
what you do is important to a lot of people .
forget it , will ya?
listen .
i give up .
i'm gonna phone 'em in , okay?
enough bullshit .
i'm outta here .
see you , fellas .
buy you some lunch .
can't let you do that .
listen , if i don't get to my class , there's gonna be a bunch of vietnamese speaking in short choppy sentences .
look , we gotta talk .
we gotta talk now .

he's currently wanted by the south vietnamese police in connection with several bombings in th area ... including the one at jimmy wah's .
surely you're familiar with that incident .
did you ever wonder how a young south vietnamese boy gets into and out of vc held territory .
it's dangerous out there .
things just jump out at you .
and yet this boy can get in and out without a scratch .
and what about jimmy wah's?
didn't you ever wonder why you were pulled out ... just moments before the whole place blew up?
or are you normally not that inquisitive?
friends of phan duc tho .
these three were executed shortly after this photo was taken .
your friend is next .
i don't recommend that you tangle with me on this one , airman .
there's not too many high ranking officers would be sympathetic to a serviceman with links to terrorists .
the army is kind of quirky that way .
a conviction on the charge of treason against the united states carries with it some penalties ... kind of on the stiff side , if you know what i mean .
i have arranged for an honourable discharge , provided you leave without incident .
ten hut .
at ease .
cronauer , i'm sorry as hell about this thing .
god damn it , i like you , son .
i like what you do .
most of all , i like what you've done for the men .
but facts are facts .
this could give the army a black eye .
i'm not gonna cover for you this time , son .
sir?
what about the show?
we'll handle it .
i'm sorry , son .
why'd you do this?
i don't like your style , your politics or your sense of humour .
i don't like what you say or how you say it .
from now on , the fighting men of vietnam will hear exactly what they're supposed to hear .
you're on a dc 8 from tan son nhut airport tomorrow at 18i : 3o hours .
i recommend you pack quietly .
that's all i have for you , airman .
you know ... you're in more dire need of a blow job than any white man in history .
whoa , there , dick .
put the brakes on .
i wanted to wait till the airman left to talk with you .
uh , dick , i'm transferring you .
transferring me , sir?
mm hmm .
where to , sir?
you're going to guam .
guam , sir !
there's nothin 'goin 'on in guam !
why guam?
dick , i've covered for you a lot of times 'cause i thought you was a little crazy .
but you're not crazy .
you're mean .
and this is just radio .
more dire need of a blow job than any white man in history . " that's funny .

listen .
no more games , okay?
the army knows about your brother .
i have to leave the country because of my association with him .
they have pictures of him .
if they find him , they will shoot him .
if you want to continue to have a brother , you take me to him now !
phan duc tho !

no wonder you hauled ass .
you were my friend .
i trusted you .
you hear me?

that's not the fucking point !
understand me?
i fought to get you into that bar , and then you blow the fuckin 'place up .
listen .
i gave you my friendship and my trust ... and now they tell me that my best friend is the goddam enemy !
enemy?
what is enemy?
you killing my own people so many miles from your home .
we not the enemy .

you used me to kill two people .
two people died in that fuckin 'bar .

my mother is dead .
and my older brother , who be 29 years old , he dead .
