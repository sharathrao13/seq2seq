my firm's done a tremendous amount of market research .
one , most americans feel that christmas is a time for family .
two , most americans feel that in order to stand being around their family , for even one or two days , they need to swill as much alcohol as humanly possible .
now , i'd like you to meet the noggertons .
they're a classic american family .
they're together on christmas , they're fat free , and 10 percent alcohol by volume .
enjoy our family , so you can enjoy your family .
what do you think?
so , you're suggesting we tell people the only way to get through the holidays is to drink spiked egg nog?
i'm suggesting the only way to get through the holidays is to buy your farm fresh , fat free , pre spiked egg nog in a bottle .
take care .
all right .
it's all good .
how do you do it?
i'm very excited .
i look forward to it .
it went pretty well , huh?
i'm a genius .
i feel like i could sell whale steaks to greenpeace .
nice image .
here are your tickets to fiji .
ah .
missy , we've been dating a while .
let's take our relationship to the next level .
i've hoped you would say that .
i got you a little pre christmas christmas gift .
yeah?
i want you to open it now because it involves our future .
the future of you and me together .
it's kind of for both of us , in that way .
okay .
tickets to fiji?
yes .
first class .
drew , on christmas?
christmas is the family holiday .
i mean , what are we doing?
what is this?
i mean , what is going on?
where is this relationship headed?
fiji .
first class .
missy?
uh uh .
okay .
here's an example of one of our problems .
you never introduced me to your family .
you never mentioned your family .
do you even have a family?
how can you be serious about me , if you're not serious about your family?
you need to get some serious help , drew .
i think you're missing the point .
if i told you everything about me , there'd be no more sense of mystery .
nothing left to discover .
with nothing left to discover , a relationship dies .
you don't want this to die , do you?
it just did .
come on .
don't be like that .
you're gonna be like that?
go ahead .
go .
i'm going to spend christmas with my family .
you can spend christmas alone .
missy .
kathryn , i need you to get a cartier bracelet to send to missy .
something expensive , a lot of diamonds , very flashy .
include a personal note from me .
what exactly do you want it to say?
something personal that shows the depth of my feelings , my emotions .
you're good .
that's why i hired you .
okay , but it's not gonna work .
my man .
oh , dougie !

it'll be great , a matzo ball soup and baklava .
all right , well , that's greek .
fine , whatever .
i'm just ...
you still there?
i know you have a baby .
i'm just saying , like , you know , they just lie there and crap themselves , right?
after a while , how interesting is that?
no , i'm not saying anything bad .
i'm just sayin '...
huh?
well , maybe , your wife doesn't have to come , man .
maybe it's me and you for christmas .
you ever think about that?
would you mind if i came by to your house and spent christmas?
it's like one or two , three days , tops .

we shouldn't have put the computer in his room .
he's gonna spend all his time there .
oh , tom .
welcome to the future , dear .
he's advancing his skills .
one day that computer's gonna get our baby a good job .
trust me .
what he's doin ', nobody's gonna pay for ,
'cause if they did , i'd have retired at 17 .
what?
there's a guy out there .
who the hell is that?
all right .
alone on christmas .
i can do this .
i rid myself of all my grievances .
be gone , grievances .
what the ...
i forgive you .
holy moly .
this joker .
what are the neighbors gonna think?
unless they want to get hit , they shouldn't be burning crap in my yard .
is he still breathing?
dear god , tom .
you've killed the man .
oh , shit !
he's still alive !
hello .
my name is drew latham .
i grew up in this house .
that's why you came back and tried to burn it down , pyroboy?
brian , call the cops .
oh , no , no , no !
that won't be necessary .
that's fine .
i was just outside burning , someone told me to burn a list of my grievances outside of the home of my birth to help me with loneliness issues .
so , it's all fine .
oh .
any hoo , apologies and i'm gonna go .
would you mind terribly if i took a look see around the house?

the squeaky stair .
wow .

my god .
hey , look at that !
i can touch the ceiling .
it's much smaller than i remember it .
did you do something?
yeah .
we had it reduced .
cost a lot , but yeah , i think it was ...
i think it was worth it .
man , this is great .
man , this is the best .
you guys sittin 'around eatin 'dinner like a family .
i always wanted that .
this is really wonderful .
wonderful .
so , what's for dessert?

and you agreed to this?
without asking me?
of course i did .
he's giving us $250, 000 .
how would you like it if i agreed to this without asking you?
well , that would depend .
would we be getting $250, 000?
okay .
what exactly did you agree to?
it's a big day for this family .
very well .
all right .
mr. latham agrees to pay the sum of $250, 000 to the valcos for services rendered until 11 : 59 pm on christmas day .
and for said sum , the valco family will aid mr. latham in recapturing those childhood christmas memories ,

well , around christmas , i get anxiety ...
no , no .
you stop talking .
mom?
drew wants a family christmas , so we're gonna be his family .
that's insane .
tell me about it .
i never had a sister , so this is bullshit right here .
okay .
you are my illegitimate love child .
mom !
and you had no idea about her .
that could be good .
you know what?
she could be the maid !
okay .
enough .
hey , my baby's home .
hi , daddy .
how are you , lissi?
hi .
i'm good .
you've obviously lost your mind .
can i talk to you in the dining room , please?
you knew about this?
stay away from my daughter .
okay , mom?
this guy is obviously crazy .
i know .
so , i'm gonna go upstairs , and take a bath , and when i wake up in the morning , he's gonna be gone , right?
maybe .
i'm not gonna be a good sport about this , mom .
oh , darling , we'd never expect you to be .
thanks .
come on , mom !
it's tree time !
okey dokey .
all right .
we're back on track .
yeah .
okay .
here we go .

now it feels like christmas .
i can smell my eyeballs burning .
very important .
don't look directly at the tree .
brian !
what?
wake up !
it's your brother , kind of !
it's snowing outside !
it's a snow day !

any time you wanna do that , let me know .
we said no iceballs , man .
oh , did we?
morning , mom .
freak .
you know what?
we may have gotten off on the wrong track .
we should start over .
here you go , drew .
thanks , mom .
mmm .
problem?
my real mom puts marshmallows in the hot chocolate .
know what i was thinking?
if you don't wanna play my sister , maybe you could be , like , a wonderful , mysterious
ecuadorean cleaning lady .
you know?
or swedish cleaning lady .
the ethnicity's not important .
but cleaning lady's good .
oh .
mmm .
what?
my real mom used the mini marshmallows .
sorry .
speaking of your mom , why aren't you annoying your own family?
that's not really your business , is it , consuela?
ho , ho , ho !
all righty .
welcome , everyone .
here you are .
what is this?
these are what we in the business call scripts , tom .
excuse me?
you don't have to worry about it .
your role is what we call " small .
well , you're what we in real life call " a jackass .
i don't know about that , but i do know that my being here may have caused some awkwardness within the family .
you think?
i do , tom .
seriously .
and it's even possible that some of it could potentially be in some small way partly my fault .
which part wasn't your fault?
bop , bop , bop , bop .
i'm talking .
okay?
so what i've done is i went ahead and wrote a sequence , so you guys can get a sense of what i'm going for here .
and we're all gonna read this aloud .
and we're all gonna read this aloud .
i feel like i'm insane .
that's why you have no lines .
mom , i believe you go first .
okay .
oh , look at us .
i sure hope you like the meal i so lovingly prepared for the people i love .
she smiles at tom .
oh , she's ...
have you acted?
you've acted before .
a little theater .
i can tell .
i see it .
it comes out .
you were in " pippin " in high school .
you played wind .
tom , you have the next line .
uh ...
say thank you to your mother for all her hard work cooking for us .
thank you .
oh , i don't work nearly as hard as you , dear .
well , that's true .
tom , let's stay on book , please .
brian , go ahead .
gee , mom , i love you like the dickens .
should we pray?
gee , beav , do you think wally's gonna give you the business?
oh , there you are , consuela .
five waters for everyone , please .
gracias .
brian , you were about to say grace .
" dear god ...
brian .
we hold hands at grace .
dear god , thank you for this meal .
thank you for blessing us with a family .
not everyone has a nice family .
and also we , o lord , are so lucky to have drew in our lives .
amen .
an emotional moment .
sorry , i keep doing that .
brian , if you eat it all up , i will let you sleep with me
like i never did when you were little .
an awkward moment .
skip ahead .
that doesn't work .
that's not supposed to be there .
what does this mean?
doo dah enters in his bathrobe .
sweet jim jiminy !
cold corn in the mornin '!
this weather is killin 'my joints .
brian , go get the shovel .
listen to me .
when alicia came , she totally ruined everything .
everything was so normal up until that point .
silencio , por favor .
so i realized what i had to do was expand the family .
i had to find my grandpa .
so i went and found my doo dah .
here he is .
my doo dah .
your doo dah looks exactly like the guy in " christmas carol . " scrooge .
that's right .
i do community theater .
and this christmas night , i'm reprising my role as scrooge in the lincoln wood theater group's production of " a christmas carol .
i hope you all can make it .
please stay in character , saul , okay?
i'm so glad that you came here .
you're gonna stay for the whole christmas holiday .
whoa , no , he's not .
i agreed to let you in the house ,
not doo doo over here .
doo dah .
nobody's talkin 'to you .
look .
i'll give you $25, 000 .
how you doin ', doo dah?
you can stay in the living room .

they eat your salami .

i'm diabetic .
that dog won't hunt , my friend .
doo dah wasn't diabetic .
go ahead and take one .
look , kid , i get that .
but if i eat this thing , i can't act not dead .
hey !
slow down .
the roads are icy .
i don't want you to kill your family !
perfect , christine .
that's what my mom would've said .
good improv .
before your father threw her out of the car .
ah , the old carriage house .
brings back memories .
what's going on?
brian , go inside .
what?
come on !
dad .
i'm in my pajamas .
you want me to sleep outside?
go .
fine .
i can't go in my room , i get ...
you know , when i become a serial killer don't act surprised .
think positive , bris eye .
use your positive mindset .
that's not what we talked about .
it's hard to get through to him .
so what's goin 'on?
what's up?
you gotta go .
what?
we can't do this no more .
what do you mean?
what can't we do?
christine and i , we're thinkin 'about breakin 'up .
what?
why?
is it my fault?
something i did?
is it the hat?
forget it .
wear whatever you want , tom .
it's not you .
it's nothin 'to do with you .
it's been goin 'on for a long time .
we're just ...
it's not workin 'out .
we were gonna wait till after the holidays to tell the kids , and you know , with you here , and with your christmas cheer crap , it's making it worse .
tom , first of all , i wanna reward you for opening up with a big " thank you , " that deserves some credit .
second , let me tell you what you need to do .
if i was you and comin 'into some money ,
i'd do somethin 'big , somethin 'you always wanted your whole life .
somethin 'that makes you happy .
i want the money .
i really do .
it's christine , she keeps ...
all right .
let me worry about christine , okay?
i'll worry about christine .
you worry about tom , 'cause it's tom time .
christine?
yes , dear?
can i talk to you?
of course , dear .
i'm your mother .
you can talk to me about anything .
great .
are you all right?
uh huh .
you sure?
'cause you just put a bra in brian's sock drawer .
oh , well , that's your brother .
15 .
likes to experiment .
we still love him .
look , christine , i know what's going on with you and tom , and first of all , i just wanna say that
i'm feeling a little ripped off here , you know?
i thought i was getting a real family .
this is bullshit .
well , it's time you grew up and faced facts , isn't it?
mommies and daddies fall in love , make babies , pay bills , get mad , and stop touching each other !
second of all ,
i was thinkin 'i could do something to help you , make you feel better .
how about just me and you go shopping?
for what?
i don't know .
just go shopping .
you know what i mean?
it's fun just to buy shit .
listen , i know all the best makeup and hair people .
the best fashion photographer in chicago owes me huge !
so?
you don't see it , do you?
you don't see what a beautiful woman you are .
you have grace and kindness and sensuality , and this incredibly striking , kind of offbeat beauty that's ...
you look in the mirror , and don't see it .
we're gonna show you .
how would you like me to arrange your very own , very hip , very sexy , yet tasteful , very elegant , very modern , very expensive photo shoot , just for you?
or not .
i mean , whatever ...
oh , drew , you've made your mama so happy .
great .
oh , mom .
hey , alicia .
want to go tobogganing?
oh , i'm sorry , drew .
have i been sending you mixed signals?
i just thought maybe instead of sitting around bickering and hating me , you might like to have some fun .
no , thanks .
ah , i see .
i get it .
you're afraid of fun .

of course i like fun .
everybody likes fun .
it's fun .
all right , so then why won't you go with me?
because it would be with you .
you know what i think?
i think you're afraid .
i think you're afraid that you will go , and have fun , and you might enjoy yourself , and you'd be with me .
what would that say about you?
that's what i think .

got propositioned by a hooker .

the blonde with the big cans?
hey , watch your language around my daughter .
brian , take a look at your father's new automobile here !

yeah !
oh , yeah !

yeah !
i do not want to do this .
ah , you say that now .
once you get going , you'll run and jump and squeal with joy .
okay?
let's do this .
here we go .
hunker down .
center your weight .
breakneck hill !
whoo !
whoo !
that was crazy !
did you see him fly down the hill?
i made a mistake .
it was scarier when i was younger .
can we go home now?
no , we can't go home !
we are gonna risk permanent paralysis or die trying !
that one !
land !
yes , sir !
whoo !
gonna be some serious fun !
sure , in a sonny bono kind of way .
what's that i hear?
a little chicken?
chicken .
yeah .
and very much so .
i'm gonna go home now .
seriously?
you're leaving?
see ya at the chopper .
wow .
never thought i'd see the day that taunt would lose its power .
what about you?
chicken with broccoli?
actually , part of me thinks that it's incredibly stupid , and the other part is in agreement .
there you go .
you're chicken .
know what i think?
what?
i think that you had no intention of going down this hill .
i think that you dragged us up here because you knew we wouldn't go down it .
i think you were showing off .
that's what i think .
wait .
you think i'm chicken?
i'm chicken?
let me give a little clue here , okay?
you think i'm chicken?
i'll show you .
you see me?
i'm ready to go .
where are you?
nowhere to be seen .
chicken .
all right .
come on .
let's go .
you're getting on?
yeah .
no !
come on , push off .
crash ]
oh , my god .
oh , god .
i told you you'd have fun with me .
sorry .
that's cool .
it's okay .
here you go .
thank you .
it's my fault you got sick .
it's not your fault .
we even might have gotten sick without tobogganing .
it didn't help walking home in wet clothes .
you wanna watch tv?
uh huh .
she's my cherry pie ]
hey .
hi .
you look different .
did you do something?
are you serious?
no , i just mean that ... ... you look good .
thanks .
where'd you go?
nice wheels .
yeah .
you like it?
yeah .
does it seem at all familiar?
didn't somebody we know have one of these?
yeah .
us .
maybe this'll help .
yeah .
i remember .
so what's your deal anyway?
my deal .
i mean , sometimes you have these moments of lucidity , but then other times it's just not so much normal .
i don't understand , i mean , i don't wanna be alone on christmas .
you've never been alone .
on christmas , it's not like being alone .
it's alone alone .
this wouldn't be one of those lucid moments .
i wasn't going for that .
okay , i see .
all right , little miss grinch .
i know you're a sophisticated , modern woman that's very jaded and nothing gets to you , and you have no emotions .
but i'd be willing to bet that even you , before you got old ... ... er than you are now , but still as young , attractive , smart and beautiful ... [ sniffling ]
that's better .
i don't know , like , some moment in your childhood before everything got complicated , when you were happy .
you must have some moment in your life that you'd like to go back and relive .
yeah .
once ,
i was , like , nine years old and we had just had this ice storm .
i was walking home from school through bishop park .
you know that one big oak tree in the middle?
it was completely frozen .
all the branches were icicles .
it was just ...
it was incredible .
it completely stopped me in my tracks .
i remember standing underneath it pretending that i was a princess in a magical crystal palace .
it was really ...
it was beautiful .
feliz navidad ]
hey , would you come outside with me for one second?
i wanna show you something .
okay .
where are you taking me?
hold on , one second .
you trust me?
uh , no .
not necessarily .
okay .
try to trust me , i wanna blindfold you .
it's a surprise .
okay .
all right?
all right .
oh , god .
all right .
follow me .
i feel that this is gonna end with " and she was never heard from again .
step , step , step .
okay .
right there .
stop .
okay .
turn this way .
okay?
all right .
all right .
oh , my god .
i can't believe you did this .
wait till you see this .
hit it , guys .
hut , hut , hut ...
you see that?
that's you right there .
i know this props guy .
he owns a prop house with figurines , and he painted your hair like that , your mouth .
those guys aren't pros .
i'm sure .
i showed them the thing .
oh , wow .
i got this dance teacher .
it's not easy to get a camel .
it's not easy taking a very personal and private moment that i have never told anybody and turning it into a theme park .
we wish you a merry christmas
shut up !
ah ...
but i'm not disappointed .
okay?
i'm not mad .
i'm just mad at myself for thinking that there was more to you than i thought .
that's you .
it's a wrap .
hut , hut , hut .
alicia?
wait a second !
i care about you .
i did that because i care about you .
look , drew , let me just give you some advice .
save your big , expensive gestures for some girl who's impressed by them ,
and when you find her , hold on to her .
otherwise , you are looking at a lifetime of lonely christmases .
i'm telling you , he is wonderful .
it's cartier .
at least he's got manners .
well , i mean , he's in the neighborhood .
he is?
darling .
what?
it's a day bracelet .
do you like it , darling?
i love it .
you're the expert on jewelry .
are you disagreeing?
absolutely not .
she just got a present .
why pick at her now?
i'm not .
brian , tell drew that i had to take off .
there was a ...
holy cow .
what are you looking at?
this is just , it's research .
when i was young , we didn't sit in our rooms drooling over nude ladies on computers .
no , sir .
we had to go behind the barn with the dirty girl and pay her a quarter so she could show us her goodies .
how does this work?
oh , well .
here , let me ...
what are you into?
hot cheerleaders ,
three way fun .
uh uh .
middle aged hotties .
you're talkin 'my language .
old enough to know how it's done , young enough to still want to do it .
that's gross .
ooh .
come to papa .
that's not bad , right?
dude , it's your mom !
oh , my god .
hey , can you print that for me?
mom , dad , listen .
please , drew has to go tonight .
i cannot spend one more second in this house with him .
well , yeah?
yeah?
so what?
so he's making fools of us !
of all of us !
alicia?
all right , look , i'm gonna take the car , and when i get home , i really hope he's gone .
alicia .
be careful with the car .
can't we talk about this?
no .
what the hell happened?
nothing .
i think she's right .
it's stupid .
this is a mistake .
i've imposed on you folks and i'm sorry .
i'll write you a check .
i'll spend christmas ...
i'll spend christmas somewhere .
no .
we don't want your money .
in cash .
check'll be just fine .
i'll get you a pen .
what's wrong with you?
hello?
" merry christmas to you too .
missy !
the bracelet is amazing , drew .
thank you .
i'm kind of in the middle of something right now .
how'd you know my favorite is cartier?
lucky guess .
how did you find me?
i talked to your secretary and she said you were with your family .
oh , drew !
i am so happy for you .
and for us .
for us?
" i know what this means , " reaching out to your family .
you want to be more serious about yourself , and more serious about me .
i wanna meet your family , drew .
i'm sure you will , and they wanna meet you one day .
oh , great .
then we can go to fiji .
how about tomorrow?
fiji?
tomorrow?
you're kidding .
that's fabulous , actually .
that's perfect .
then tonight we can spend christmas eve together with our families .
ah ...
that's gonna be hard to pull off , you know?
it's very short notice , and we ...
one of the family members is challenged , and ... [ clears throat ] ... requires a lot of time to put on
the proper headgear ...
oh .
no problem .
we're here .
you're here?
look outside !
oh , my god !
you're here? !
i mean , oh , my gosh !
you're totally here !
my girlfriend's family is here !

pretend for a couple hours !
we'll leave by midnight .
i'm begging you !
read paragraph three .
you bailed , it's done .
you write the check and get out !
what?
no !
wait a minute !
okay , look , i wanna go !
i'm dying to go !
i gotta have a life to go back to !
this girl is it !
i can't tell her i rented a family .
i'm sure she already knows you're crazy .
it kinda shows .
a deal's a deal .
that's it .
unless you sweeten the pot .
that's extortion , tom !
i think i hear the doorbell .
no !
no , no !
wait !
no , no !
i'll give you another 75 grand .
okay?
but you gotta do it good , you gotta try .
or else i'll be so mad at you guys !

i'm drew's father , and this is his mother .
christine .
mom .
letitia .
horace .
and he's our son .
there's no doubt about that .
that's for sure .
oh !
i would love to see pictures of drew when he was small .
oh , we're not gonna bore everyone , that's embarrassing .
good idea .
bath time for baby .
oh .
thanks , mom .
look at him .
drew , are you sure that's you?
oh , that's me all right .
i remember it well .
that was in autumn and the photographer ...
no , i don't think so .
there's no little dingle .
nope .
no .
yes .
it's there , but it's not ...
you can't see it , because it was so long that mom had to tuck it back when she gave me a bath .
it got tangled .
you remember , mom .
yeah , yeah .
from the moment he was born , it was ...
... freakishly long .
right .
yes .
i'll get it .
no , no , no !
i'll get it , son .
you stay right there .
thanks , dad .
so , here we are .
yeah .
so are we keeping you folks from dinner plans , or ...

doo dah .
doo dah .
doo dah's my grandpa .
he'll tell us stories ...

we usually let him in , dad .
let's talk , son .
okay .

this guy says he's doo dah's understudy .
he's not white .

i don't want to cause problems .
drew , listen .
i'm in a bit of a jam now .
drew , drew , wait .
what?
yes?
i came back here because i wanted to apologize to you .
yes , the thing in the park was a bit garish and obnoxious , but that's you .
not that you're garish and obnoxious , it's just that you do things in a big way .
yes , i do , i do .
and i'm touched .
thank you .
that means ...
and thank you .
you smell like fear .
there have been some developments ...
i have a gift for you .
i'll be right back .

hi !
hi , honey .
your mom sent me in here to get a cheeseball .
what's that?
this is a cheeseball .
let's play a game where you don't come back till they eat the whole thing .
this is great .
your family isn't what i expected .
i'm glad you wanted to introduce me .
it's all i ever wanted .

thank you so much .
okay .
all right .
yes .
i know .
i love you .
okay .
fiji's gonna be great .
it will be great .
fiji time !
that's what this was about?
you put us through this for a girl?
no , no , no .
just ...
can i open my present now?
sure .
i thought this was because you had a painful childhood .
i'm sorry .
you said you never wanted to see me , so i accepted that .
i was broken up with her , but she showed up and wanted to meet my family .
i couldn't tell them it was a rented family .
i know you hate me .
i hate me .
i hate my own guts .
i know this is horrible , but would you just please , could you help me , so i can get through this?
you'll never see me again .
just take a ride for an hour .
your parents will call you when it's clear .
drew , your dad wants more salami !
they're playing along?
your parents , they're crazy .
they think it's fun .
i'm sorry .
okay?
i gotta go .
i'll see you .
i miss you .
thank you .
you're welcome .
see ya .
they think it's fun , huh?
maybe they're right .
your tree , christine , it's so colorful .
your tree , christine , it's so colorful .
you know , it reminds me of mexico .
not the better hotels , but the colors of the simple people .
it's so bright and vulgar .
mom !
dad !
i'm home !
alicia , you're back .
you're back , alicia .
oh , you're back .
this is our daughter , alicia .
this is mrs. vangilder .
please .
letitia .
i'm so pleased to meet you .
really .
and this is our little missy .
oh , missy , missy .
oh , gosh .
i've just heard so much about you from drew .
god , you're gorgeous .
and you are so not fat .
drew !
what's the matter with you?
i'm sorry?
drew , i'm not fat .
no .
i was just thinking that .
you must be mr. vangilder .
i would never say that .
don't mind us .
we're a bunch of kidders .
i like the family .
oh , well , you obviously haven't met brian .
by the way , where is brian?
here .
your mom's startin 'to like your grandfather hittin 'on her .
there's one you don't often hear on christmas eve .
it's unbelievable .
poor thing .
poor thing .
excuse me .
it's true .
what's happening over here?
what's going on?
i'm learning so much from your sister .
oh , you are .
great .
i didn't know you were a baton twirler .
yeah .
gave away the big secret , i guess , didn't you?
oh , not the big one , so don't push me .
let's go talk to doo dah .
he's telling stor ...
i want you to see the bracelet drew got me .
ooh , cartier , huh?
wow .
look at that .
that's just beautiful .
well , that's my brother .
just never afraid to put a price tag on his feelings .
yeah .
that's my sister .
never understanding there's love , you can care and want to show it in a big way , and you shouldn't be put down and mocked , and made hurt feelings .
when you love somebody , you don't have to show it in a big way .
so you were slumming when you were making out with me in the kitchen?
it's a very , very affectionate family .
we show our love .
italians .
we're just very warm .
red hot , even .
all right , that's it .
give me this .
get up .
sit down !
okay !
who wants a tour of the house?
what you're using are stairs .
we like these for going up .
this is the bathroom .
what are you doing to me?
what?
you're killing me .
no , i'm just playing along , brother .
i think missy likes me .
she thinks i'm funny .
this was little drew's room .
now , it's brian's .
aw .
brian , don't be rude .
we have guests .
he'd live in front of the screen if we'd let him right , tom?
it's that insatiable appetite for knowledge .
oh , shit !
brian , what have you done? !
tom , i don't know what that is .
i do .
it's my wife shooting a " v " for victory with her legs .
it's been a while , but that's what it looks like .
honestly .
that's my little girl .
horace , get our coats .
what's going on?
you have no idea .
missy , get your coat !
there's ham !
we're not going .
we'll stay .
lighten up .
it's just a picture .
i had pictures taken for fun .
where would you get that stupid idea? !
coats !
someone say coats?
get the coats .
gotta get coats .
oh .
some things cannot be unseen .
brian?
brian?
great .
just great , christine .
i'll be at the travel lodge .
merry christmas .
mom?
mom?
oh , dear god .
wait a minute !
there's more of mom's buffet .
if you think we're staying after that display , think again .
trollops who pose for dirty pictures , various incestuous overtones and old , unexplained men .
this is without a doubt the worst christmas i've ...
oh , shut up , letitia !
what?
i'll tell you what .
i've put up with your high and mighty act for 25 years , but they don't have to .
i don't remember you being superior when you got knocked up by skippy altsheller and then tricked me into marrying you .
oh , my god !
i'm sorry , missy .
missy , darling , it's not true .
you were premature .
oh , come on , letitia !
tell your mother thanks , drew .
and merry christmas .
missy , we'll wait for you in the car .
you know , really .
yuletide's a bitch , ain't it?
oh , shut up !
just shut up !
okay !
fiji .
let's go to fiji right now .
you're right , drew .
just screw family .
all we need is each other .
just take me away .
i'm sorry , missy .
i can't .
just go home , okay?
i'm sorry about all this .
i'll spend christmas alone .
oh , fine .
okay .
well , then ... ... the only thing i have left to say to you is i am keeping this bracelet .
i feel bad drinking liquor you're gonna need .
i better go .
merry christmas .
all right .
missy , get in the car !
my god !
have you lost your mind?
did you just lose it in there?
you know , i have to ask , just how bad is your real family that you would rather spend your christmas like this?
there was no real family .
what do you mean , " there is no family "?
you must've had a family .
i mean , you must've had a doo dah , right?
i had a friend whose grandfather , was called doo dah .
i always liked that .
my dad walked out on us on christmas when i was four .
it was basically just me and my mom .
she was a waitress at the 24 hour coffee shop .
she didn't have a lot of money , so when christmas came around , it was an opportunity for her to take a double shift .
she did .
and , you know , my christmases were , basically , i just kind of sat around the house , you know?
then at night , i'd walk down there , and mom would always buy me a grown up stack of pancakes , and i would sit by myself at the end of the counter and eat 'em .
i did that for christmas every year until i turned 18 .
i haven't been able to walk in a coffee shop since , though .
where's your mom now?
mom died when i was in college .
i'm sorry .
you know what?
there's nothing that you can do about those christmases .
but the one that you can do something about , the one that's here and now , you just spent that destroying my family .
alicia , just for the record ,
i didn't destroy your family .
what are you talking about?
your parents are splitting up .
it's obvious .
brian knows it .
that's why he spends all his time in his room on his computer .
you just didn't wanna see it .
i can understand that .
i'm gonna go get my dad .
lock up when you leave .
well , all right .
i forgive you .
no !
no , spirit !
no !
i will honor christmas in my heart and try to keep it all the year .
no one's home !
what?
i hear you .
are you gonna hit me?
no .
are you gonna do something else that still hurts?
no .
you gonna invite me in?
you just stopped by to hang out and catch up?
reminisce?
you owe me money .
right .
the money .
okay , come on in .
i'll get my checkbook .
you rented my place when you could've been staying here?
well , i gotta admit , this is nice .
thanks .
you still splitting up with christine?
yeah .
i guess .
that would be a shame .
what are you laughing at?
nothing .
it's just ironic .
i paid all that money to be part of your family .
you're giving it away for nothing .
look at this .
that's the ticket to doo dah's play .
yeah .
i got mine too .
i'm not very good at apologizing .
i don't know if they're in there .
come on .
what do you have to lose?
what do you want with me?
much .
who are you?
in life , i was your partner ...
see anybody?
that's doo dah right there .
what is the reason for this visit?
it is getting late and i've been hard at work .
he's not that bad .
to warn you , ebenezer .
he's not that good either .
i'm gonna find christine .
learn from me .
my spirit never walked beyond our counting house .
it never roved beyond our money changing hole .
so i am condemned to wander through the world to see what i might have shared on earth , then turned to happiness .
what are you doing here?
you were always a good businessman .
doo dah's family , right?
brian .
it's me , move over .
no , man .
go find one of the other empty seats .
move over , bri .
come on .
where's your sister?
shh .
dear brother !
fanny !
christine ...
if i were to leave , i wouldn't even know where to go .
then why leave?
that's what i'm sayin '.
i don't wanna leave .
then don't .
all right , i won't .
okay .
is that all right?
yeah .
it's good .
bri , that girl ...
she's kinda cute for you .
talk to her .
stop it .
she's gonna hear .
i saw you looking at her .
stop .
i can tell you like ...
i can hear you .
that's embarrassing .
that's our grandfather .
this is brian .
there , brian .
you're all set .
i'm sorry .
is that your brother?
yeah .
how do we travel exactly?
through the air .
we fly !
not so hard !
wedgie !
wedgie !
alicia?
hey .
hey .
were you in there the whole time?
no .
i was just here to pick up my mom .
she's in there with your dad .
they're kinda making out in the third row .
really?
yeah .
that's good .
look .
i don't expect you to want to talk to me or anything , so i'm not gonna bother you and give you a hard time , camp outside your place and stalk you and you know .
but i do want to say that i'm sorry for what i put you through and say thank you .
so who are you renting for new year's
'cause you know , us valcos , we book up kind of fast .
i see that .
and i'd get on it if i were you .
i'm lookin 'for a family with maybe a bearded , irascible dad with a heart of gold .
a brother who stays in his room all the time by himself , and a sister who is ... ... wonderful and smart , and really beautiful .
because i think that's the kind of person that ... ... i could fall in love with .
you know anybody like that?
i know it's tough .
let me think .
not offhand , but i'll get back to you .
let me know .
have yourself " a merry little christmas ]
i hear you , dear .
daddy , stop the car !
oh , my god !
oh , my god !
he's kissing his sister .
that is open mouth .
'tis the season to be jolly .
get us out of here !
they're tryin 'to keep warm .
come on !
