and he's already hit two home runs tonight .
reggie !
reggie !
and just listen to that crowd .
reggie !
reggie !
reggie !
reggie !
reggie !
come on , reggie !
hit another one !
hit another home run !
coop , he's already hit two .
it's a fly ball to right , and deep !
that's going to be way back !
and that's going to be gone !
yea !
reggie jackson hits his third home run of the game !
yes !
whoo !
all right !
good catch , coop .
i can't believe it .
i totally had it , but my glasses slipped .
remer , someday i'm gonna become a big sports star , too .
whatever you say , coop .
you just watch me , dude .
you just watch me .
there was a time in america ... when contests of athletic prowess ... were a metaphor for the nobility of man .
historic moments , forged by the love of the game , celebrated the human potential to achieve excellence .
but as time passed and the country neared the millennium , something went awry .
manning rolls right .
he's got plough at the ten .
the five touchdown , dallas !
the ideal of sportsmanship ... began to take a back seat to excessive celebration .
the athletes caring less about executing the play ... than planning the vulgar grandstanding ... that inevitably followed even the most pedestrian of accomplishments .
the games themselves became subordinate ... to the quest for money .
stadiums and arenas ... became nothing more than giant billboards ... to promote commercial products .
players sold their services to the highest bidder , much like the hired guns of the old west .
thank you .
and after playing for new england ,
san diego , houston , st. louis , a year for the toronto argonauts , plus one season as a greeter at the desert lnn ,
i'm happy to finally play here in the fine city of miami .
minnesota .
whatever .
shit .
soon it was commonplace for entire teams to change cities ... in search of greater profits .
the minneapolis lakers moved to los angeles where there are no lakes .
the oilers moved to tennessee where there is no oil .
the jazz moved to salt lake city where they don't allow music .
the oakland raiders moved to l. a. and then back to oakland .
no one in los angeles seemed to notice .
the search for greener pastures went on unabated .
continued expansion diluted the talent pool , forcing owners to recruit heavily ...
from prisons , mental institutions and texas .
fistfighting and brawling permeated every sport , overshadowing any athletic competition .
oh !
as the problems mounted , the fans became less and less interested .
to reverse the trend , major sports started interleague play .
when that novelty wore off , they tried intersports play .
but no matter how far major sports went , it wasn't enough to bring the fans back .
the spirit of athletic competition , however , indeed was not dead .
its seed merely lay dormant in the dreams of the young .
you know , remer , someday i'm gonna be a big sports star .
you know , remer , someday i'm gonna own a big sports bar .
hurry it up , coop .
hold on .
i just gotta water the plants .
i don't wanna go to a party with a bunch of losers from high school .
but this is britney kiser's house , and i really want to fuck her .
dr. kiser .
dr. kiser .
coop and remer .
we graduated with britney .
you graduated?
of course we graduated , cock beer?
man , this place looks like a dockers commercial .
oh , hey , stef !
coop !
remer !
you want a beer?
oh , my god !
you guys haven't changed since high school .
oh , cool .
no , it isn't .
cock .
hey , skid mark steve !

well , we wouldn't miss your party .

huh .
well , ted told us about it .
excuse me .

dude , we're never gonna get a chick like britney kiser , are we?
or any other chick .
but it's only 'cause we have no jobs .
our rent check's three months overdue , and our gas is about to get shut off .
what do girls want anyway?
well , apparently , not total losers .
well , we're pretty good at basketball .
as long as we don't have to run or jump or dribble .
you know what i mean?
that shit's overrated anyway .
hey !

yeah , a totally great bed .
but that's jenkins 'bed .
your bed's over here .

joe bryant , wlgm , at the scene where an unusual new driveway game ... has captured the imagination of at least one neighborhood .
an entire league has sprung up around this quirky ... round robins , starting with 12 teams in june , now down to just two , including , we're told , the inventors of the game , childhood friends
it's off the rim .
could be a double play .
maxwell tips .
newman's try .
no !
shirts have a shot at the conversion .
remer !
keeps it alive .
last chance .
coop .
up !
good !
they make the conversion !
and the home run counts !
yeah !
yeah !
yeah !
yeah !
what a game !
the shirts win the world championship of baseketball !
yeah !
gentlemen .
gentlemen .
gentlemen , i'm ted denslow .
ted denslow , the billionaire?
yes .
anyway , i like your little game here .
how'd you like to go pro?
baseketball?
national baseketball league .
we're not interested .
now , wait a minute .
hear me out .
now , you kids with your loud music and your dan fogelberg , your zima , hula hoops , and pac man video games , don't you see?
people today have attention spans ... that can only be measured in nanoseconds .
i hear you .
just look at these people .
whoa !
way to go , coop .
they feel a certain connection with you as players .
with baseketball , we can start fresh , not allow teams to change cities ... or players to be traded .
and everybody will get paid the same , just like when i was a kid , and players were treated like
indentured servants?
yes !
and the real beauty of this game ... is anyone can play .
any normal joe can be a sports hero .
haven't you ever wanted to be a sports hero?
sure .
once .
but that that was a long time ago .
well , if i know anything about this country ,
america will go nuts for baseketball .
america will go crazy for baseketball .
listen to that crowd .
listen to that crowd .
call an ambulance !
ooh , ooh , ooh
ooh , ooh , ooh i say she never cared
and that she never will
to do it all again
i guess i'll have to wait until then
lf i get drunk
well , the better i'll understand my baby
you won't bother me no more
and if you're drinkin 'well , you know that you're my friend , and i'll say
i think i'll have myself a beer
ninth inning .
the beers still behind by three runs ... and now down to their last out .
and the pressure on these players has got to be enormous .
all right , you guys .
we've got one out left .
we're not beat yet .
we can still win this thing .
can we do it?
yeah !
yeah !
go , coop !
what a game these fans are seeing .
that gentleman , of course , beers owner ted denslow , the father of professional baseketball , along with his lovely new wife , yvette .
now shooting , number 44 , coop " airman " cooper !
coop !
coop !
coop !
coop is heading for the triple square .
bob costas , this has to be one of the most exciting baseketball games ... in recent memory .
just five years ago , this game was played only on driveways .
and it's hard to believe just five years ago , those girls were only in grade school .
coop !
coop !
coop !
so , coop at the triple line .
jansen sets up for the psych out .
hey , coop .
be right with you , dirk .
it's good !
nothing but net .
coop triples again .
he's hit for the cycle seven times tonight .
he tricked me .
yeah !
go , coop !
yeah !
and listen to those foam heads doing the beers chug .
chug !
chug !
chug !
chug !
coop's on third , with two down .
and that brings up squeak scolari .
i knew it was gonna come down to me .
relax , dude .
it's not just you .
we're a team .
and it all comes down to just one man .
oh , god !
listen to me , dude .
if i could have one guy out there , it'd be you .
unfortunately , that one man is squeak scolari .
ah , shit !
pretend this is just another game .
the denslow cup is , of course , the biggest game of the season .
ah , christ !
will you turn that shit off?
i'm so scared .
listen to me !
you make that shot , or i'm gonna shove your head so far up your fucking ass ... you'll have to wear yourself as a hat !
and in the dugout , doug remer giving his teammate some last minute encouragement .
now , go out there and make that shot !
fuck !
the talented felon girls ... appearing in their third denslow cup game .
now shooting , number 23 ,
squeak " little bitch " scolari !
let's go
so squeak scolari walks out to take the last remaining single .
come on , bitch !
nice one , bitch !
hey , squeak .
miss it .
miss it .
it's good .
and the beers stay alive in the ninth .
dallas felons owner , baxter cain , hoping for another denslow cup victory .
now shooting , number 17 ,
doug " sir swish " remer !
two on , two out .
remer heads for the double line .
remer , you better make sure your toe's not over the line .
hey , jansen , nice psych out , dingleberry .
yes !
it's in .
it's now a two run game .
dirk jansen apparently missing another psych out .
and everyone here at beers garden is on their feet .
coop !
coop !
coop !
and , al , at a time like this , you can't help thinking about guys like john elway , guys who kept coming close and then finally got there .
ow !
if coop can make this one ,
the beers 'long wait will be over .
hey , coop , it looks like your boy denslow's about to buy the farm .
aah !
ah !
oh !
he missed .
oh !
he missed .
i don't believe it .
the felons win their second consecutive denslow cup ...
no , no . on the strength of a dirk jansen psych out .
aw !
i got you , dude .
i got you .
you  whoa , whoa , whoa .
relax .
relax .
do the happy dance .
we just lost the game .
do the happy dance .
where's the singing?
aw , i don't wanna sing .
do the singing .
come on .
sing .
happy dance doin 'the happy dance
shit !
denslow !
and these beers fans have to be disappointed .
what an unfortunate thing to happen on dozen egg night .
oh !
oh !
oh !
oh !
it's my husband .
somebody help him .
oh , god !
if there's anything you need  oh , teddy .
i can't believe it .
he just fell over .
oh !
mrs. denslow?
mrs. denslow !
oh !
i wish there was something i could do .
uhh !
they stopped serving them after the seventh inning .
somebody get this man a hot dog !
you're absolutely right , jim .
ted denslow was a hero because his vision brought baseketball ... from neighborhood driveways into big arenas , but more importantly , into the hearts and tvs of america .
it's a very sad day .
yee ha !
his untimely death casts an unbearable pall over an otherwise sweet victory .
hey , yeah !
and all of our hearts ...
are with you and your family on this  go , dallas !
dirk jansen , winner of the winter's warm douche m. v. p. trophy .
what's your take on this stunning upset?
the whole key to this game was when i psyched out coop .
no doubt about it .
and all you people watching
i can't believe this guy .
he didn't psych me out .
if anyone should get the psych out , it should be denslow .
dude , weak .
coop , i know this is a dark time for you , but i'd like to get your thoughts on what happened today .
well , tim , today i lost the big game and a dear friend .
um , i'm feeling pretty vulnerable right now .
i don't think i should be alone .
i really need people to talk
it certainly does seem to be raining shit on joe cooper right now .
on paper , the beers had the far superior team .
with the outside shooting of coop and the deadly accuracy of doug remer , what happened out there?
well , you know , it was a team effort , and i guess it took every player working together to lose this one .
thanks , doug .
and so
hey !
you wanna do an interview with me?
no .
so another baseketball championship is in the books .
yet another opportunity lost for the beers .
man , i gotta go .
hey , coop .
coop !
what's going on?
coop !
coop !
hey , coop !
this is tim mccarver from beers garden ...
where the dallas felons have defeated the milwaukee beers ...
in denslow cup iv by a score of 13 to 11 .
everybody in .
one at a time .
aw , please .
can we?
there he is !
where?
oh , man !
cool !
can we talk to him?
can we stay?
please , miss reed .
excuse me .
excuse me .
hi .
would you mind signing a couple of autographs for the kids?
i think you're looking for the dallas locker room .
it's over there .
i know , but it was so crowded .
i mean , um , they would really rather have your autograph .
really?
anyway , would you mind signing these?
uh , sure .
oh .
uh , it's nice to meet you , miss ...
reed .
jenna reed .
joe cooper .
coop .
i know .
are all these kids with you?
oh , yeah .
i've been the director of the dream come true foundation ... since october .
oh , the ones that grant wishes to sick and dying kids , right?
well , we prefer to think of them as health challenged ... and survival impaired .
you're a big fan of baseketball?
no , not really .
i mean , the kids are big fans .
i try and keep them interested in things that are a little more permanent .
permanent?
you know how professional athletes come and go .
not in baseketball .
there's rules against it .
well , hello .
miss reed , this is remer .
would you like a fresh pretzel?
i baked it myself .
oh .
thank you .
it goes great with mustard .
okay .
miss reed .
miss reed .
dude , you didn't make that pretzel , did you?
of course not , but chicks like guys who can cook .
what?
see , it works .
she was checking out my ass .
she wasn't checking out your ass .
all set then?
i better get these kids back .
little travis is getting impatient .
hey , i love kids .
which one's travis?
here .
heads up , big guy .
uhh !
are you all right , travis?
i think he's sleeping .
he needs a little work on the hands .
he's blind , doug .
ah !
felons fans rejoiced in their team's denslow cup victory ... with a huge celebration in downtown dallas .
14 injured , three dead .
and on a sad note , the sports world was devastated tonight ... by the passing of ted denslow .
by all accounts , the late beers owner seemed to be the only one ... surprised by his death .
and it appears time just finally ran out ... for the old cocksucker .
theodore denslow , dead at 85 .
his hairpiece was 24 .
these chaps i wore in rootin 'tootin 'rhythm ...
these chaps i wore in rootin 'tootin 'rhythm ...
i bequeath to my nephew herman .
hope he looks as snappy in them as i did .
and this poncho that kept me dry during the filming of
mrs. denslow .
baxter cain .
may i sit down?
of course .
my deepest sympathy on your great loss .
thank you , mr. cain .
my valuable hand painted plate commemorating the pope's visit ... to dodger stadium ,
i leave to my niece susan .
aw !
limited edition , signed in the mold ,
with a photocopied certificate of authenticity .
jenna .
this six shooter i wore  what are you doing here?
well , i'm not sure .
i i got this letter .
yeah , yeah , me , too .
and the toothbrush used to clean the oats ...
oh !
clumsy idiot !
where's the body?
they buried him two days ago .
this is the will reading .
oh .
well , in that case these are for you , jenna .
now as a special fluke of charity ,
i bequeath these season tickets to the dream come true foundation .
thank you .
i had nothing but respect for your late husband .
unfortunately , he was the one person who stood in the way ... of making any kind of changes in baseketball ... that might increase the owners 'profits .
i can't imagine what he had against making money .
i trust that quality isn't sexually transmitted .
that's pretty sweet , huh?
yeah .
the kids will be very excited .
especially little joey .
joey?
well , he's such a big fan of yours .
he's going into the hospital next week , and he begged me to ask you if you'd come by for a visit .
but it's not a good idea .
i'd love to come by .
hey , i'll come by .
i like hospitals .
no , you don't .
you like taco bell .
i went to this hospital in france and got together with this chick .
dude , that was a hostel .
oh , yeah .
and finally , of course , my beloved beers ,
i bequeath controlling interest to ...
joseph r. cooper .
yes !
we own the team !
i gave him the best three months of my life .
sweet !
way to go , dude !
and , coop?
yes , mr. denslow?
i know you have it in you to lead the beers to victory this season ... because if you don't , the team reverts to yvette .
what?
don't feel badly about losing the team .
i believe this is merely a temporary situation .
thank you , mr. cain .
it's nice to have a strong , handsome man like you on my side .
well , yes .
i'd love to discuss this further with you .
why don't you visit sometime?
maybe we could , uh ...
iay some carpet , if you know what i mean .
at this time , i'd like to ask everyone to leave the room ... so i can have a private moment with coop .
now that we're alone , coop , there's something i wanna tell you .
remember when you had the crabs ...
and the only thing that made you feel better was this lotion?
well , i found another use for it .
it feels so good , it makes me wanna sing .
just like that night we spent in the tattoo parlor in chicago .
come on , baby .
i'm too sexy for my shirt
too sexy for my shirt
so sexy it hurts
and i'm too sexy for my car
too sexy for my car too sexy by far
you gettin 'this?
that's two rooms done .
boy , those corners are tricky .
you've done a fine job , yvette .
now , as i was saying , i think i've come up with a plan ... to make sure that coop never wins that denslow cup .
oh .
so then the team will be mine?
yes .
that's wonderful , baxter .
do you want me to move on to the conference room?
no .
not yet .
but you know , i think my lobby could use a good buffing , if you know what i mean .
mmm .
i know exactly what you mean .
oh !
oh , god !
oh !
oh , i can't do this shit !
and the beers coming up to bat ... for the first time in this season opener against miami , a game they have dedicated to ted denslow , a team wearing black in memory of the late beers owner .
the beers cheerleaders also mourning the loss .
glamour is a rocky road
mmm !
mmm !
mmm !
skin flicks , lipstick baby scribbles in the mirror
drama overdosage
dude , it's a whole different ball game now that you own the team .
yeah .
i was just thinking .
denslow was right .
this season could be different .
we just gotta kick some ass .
we're playing to keep this team .
you up for it?
dude , i'm in , all or nothin '.

we're going to be voting next week ... on making some changes in baseketball's rules .
i want to tell the others that you're with us .
why?
baseketball's fine .
of course , in some respects .
but until we allow teams to move cities and players to change teams ... and take advantage of lucrative corporate tie ins , you and your colleagues are going to have to continue working for
chicken poo?
ugh !
feed .
chicken feed .
coop , the ball is in your court .
in order for those rules to change , every owner has to vote yes .
denslow was already filthy rich .
he didn't need the changes .
but you do .
look , i appreciate what you're saying , but you're asking me to go against every reason we created this game .
well , before you make any hasty decisions , discuss it with your teammate .
i don't have to .
we're best friends .
we think alike .
look , i'm sorry , but if you want unanimous consent , you're gonna have to get it from one of the other owners .

three?

remer , can i talk to you over there real quick?
thanks .
hey , you know , joey , i've hit my fair share of home runs , too .

i think coop's the greatest guy in the whole wide world .

there , i feel much better now .
aah !
mr. squeak?

hey , anybody call a taxi?

oh !
oh , my , what a story this is .
little joey thomas undergoing a lifesaving operation tonight .
the fans here , of course , all wearing yellow ribbons ... in support of this brave little boy .
and his hero , joe cooper , promising to hit three home runs , a promise that could mean the difference between life and death ...
for this brave little boy .
hey , pete , what's the matter with coop tonight?
i don't know , but he's one for 11 and he smells like christian slater .
coop in the home run circle , getting ready to take his shot .
it's up .
it's good !
coop sinks his second home run of the game .
his blood sugar's way up since yesterday .
has there been any change in his fluid intake?
sweet jesus !
his sodium's level through the roof !
it's the strangest thing .
he's eight years old , and he smells like robert downey , jr .
ninth inning .
everyone's stomach in knots here , as coop steps up for his last at bat .
coop !
coop !
one more chance for that third home run .
hey , she's here , man , that girl from the bar .
that's a guy .
what?
a guy?
yeah , that's a dude .
you're just saying that 'cause you want her for yourself .
i'm saying that because she's a guy .
it's impossible .
just look at her .
she's got the cutest little upturned nose , the softest lips , the sweetest adam's apple .
yeah .
i think i can smell her perfume from here .
coop !
coop !
coop !
coop !
shh .
shh .
coop calls for quiet .
one more chance for that third home run .

he'll be fine in the morning .

he needs his sleep .
joey , i'm sorry i missed that third home run .

reggie jackson having an incredible night .

and he's already hit two home runs tonight .
and you have to wonder just what charlie hough must be thinking , as reggie steps into the box here in the eighth .
reggie !
reggie !

... nature's fury when man and beast collide ... on the back roads and byways of america .
aw !

jenna .

uh , come in .
well , when you weren't at the hospital , i came right over .
apparently , there was some sort of terrorist attack on the post op ward .
terrorist?
yeah .
evidently , they were disguised as baseketball players .
they went on some sort of rampage , and i was so worried about ...
joey .

oh , he's fine .
he came through the operation with flying colors .
with that new liver , he should be peeing like a champ in no time .
that's kidneys , coop .
oh .
well , uh , have a seat .
i just wanted to stop by and thank you for all you've done for joey .
oh , it's nothing .
i'm sure he's going to remember this day for the rest of his life .
yeah , i don't doubt that .
oh !
what a great picture .
look at you guys .
you seem so happy .
yeah , l i guess we were .
we were just best friends playing ball in the driveway .
next thing i know , i'm on espn and wheaties boxes .
and i guess it's all pretty sweet .
but nowadays , since denslow's been gone ,
i'm in charge of the team , and the whole league now .
sometimes i forget why i play the game .
why do you play it , coop?
mr. october .
the guy in the chippendales calendar?
no , that was dwayne zackemore .
i mean ... whoever it was that month .
i'm talking about reggie jackson .
i saw him play in a world series once .
he hit three home runs in one game .
i caught the third one in the stands .
i remember growing up , it meant so much to me .
all i ever dreamed of was to be that guy , have that one shining moment .
be a hero .
you already are a hero , coop .
you've won these kids 'hearts , but
what?
well , i'm just worried about getting attached
i mean , the kids getting attached .
i don't want them to be hurt .
jenna , i would never do anything to hurt these kids .
but what joey really needs to know ... is where are you going to be next year .
right here .
and the next year , and the year after that .
right up until joey grows up ... and gets a driver's license ... and ... starts going out with girls ... and meets the right one ... and forgets about baseketball altogether .
goes home , does some push ups , fucks the sleeve of his favorite jacket .
what?
huh?
i'm i'm just saying we'll be here for joey .
i promise .
oh , coop , i want to believe you .
i want to believe you more than anything

mr. cain
mr. cain .
mr. cain?

mr. remer .
oh , hey .
mr. cain .
i see you've been admiring my museum .

when i see something i want , i get it .
remind me the next time you're here to show you the prize in the collection .
my autographed ty cobb bat .
i'm planning to expand the museum out here next year .
killer setup , mr. cain .
what do you pay in rent here?
nothing .
i own it .
oh , that reminds me .
can you break a 20?
what , dollars?
i didn't think so .
let me get straight to the point , don .
may i call you don?
yeah , i guess so .
don , when i see one of baseketball's hottest stars ... with less than $20 in his pocket , driving an american car , sharing a small house with two other guys , you know what that says to me?
homos?
no , no , no .
it says you're underappreciated .
and underpaid !
oh , yeah , i mean , i guess we are underpaid .
i want to change all that .
players of your caliber should be making the big bucks .
don't you agree?
remer !
remer !
try to stay with me on this , all right?
all right .
now , last week , i tried to get coop to agree to certain rule changes ... that would make you millions .
me?
millions?
now listen carefully .
do you think shaq got rich playing in orlando?
hardly .
he made his fortune moving to l. a.
you know how much he makes now?
as much as he made playing in college?
what?
no !
lots more big money .
and you can too !
would i have to quit baseketball?
what?
no !
i need you to get coop to go along !
he'd have to quit baseketball too?
did i just fart?
uhh !
top of the seventh , and those cheers you're hearing ... are from the nearly 15, 000 on hand here for anal probe night .
so , two outs , and doug remer heading for the triple square .
he's 0 for 12 so far tonight .
in fact , with the exception of coop , the beers are ice cold .
oh , man , that doesn't even qualify as an air ball !
and the beers are gone in the seventh .
the aliens now coming up with the top of their order .
which , if you're scoring at home , is the same three guys who came up last inning .
all right , what the hell's going on?
you guys are lying down out there !
oh , i get it .
you guys are pissed off .
uh , why?
dude , you turned down cain's offer without talkin 'to us .
mm hmm !
yeah .
all right , what do you want , dude?
dude , what do you think?
we invented this game together , but you get to control everything .
listen , cain has some pretty good ideas  dude , denslow gave me the team .
i already told cain no .
dude , i'm sure denslow is happy in his little worm farm but
dude , i'm not gonna do it .
all right , dude , listen to me carefully .
do you think shaq got rich playing in orlando?
no , he got rich playing in college .
everybody knows that .
dude , it's not about the money .
it's about tradition .
look , think about the greats who have played this game .
it's because of them .
it's because of us that i can't bow down to a guy like cain .
that's easy for you to say , 'cause you got the team !
we got jack shit !
even squeak is pissed off !
hell , i never really minded .
shut up , bitch !
dude , quit thinkin 'about yourself for a change !
dude , i'm not gonna cave in .
end of story , dude .
dude .
dude !
dude !
dude !
dude .
well , i guess you've got a point there .
all right , maybe i was wrong .
from now on , we're full partners .
really?
and you guys you all own part of the team too .
really?
you'd be willing to do that for us?
yeah , and that's not all .
i'm talkin 'prime equity stock options , comprehensive health care , full dental , traveling h. m. o. , and the first 20 weeks of psychiatric care free of charge

the once proud beast , the broken girl , her mother , and finally , the man they called the whisperer .
the woman stared hopefully ... into the ancient cowboy's weathered face .

his disjointed voice seemed to be coming from afar .
the beers win their tenth consecutive game .

oh , that's jenna reed .
she's the director of some kids 'charity , um

he's been talkin 'some serious shit about you all night .
yeah , he told everyone that he caught you ... jacking off in the bathroom before the game .
he saw that?

i think we should .
no one's watching .
we won the game , we've got friends , we've got everything !

i'm not crying because i'm happy .

jenna , wait .
gentlemen !
mr. cain !
i couldn't help but overhear your conversation with miss reed .
dude , what are you doing here?
i jet here , i jet there .
anyway , i just wanted to assure you there's no reason ... for your girlfriend's foundation to go into chapter 11 or for that matter , 12 , 13 or 14 .
uh , but i think i may have a solution to her problem .
there .
it's a time tested moneymaker .
every athlete does it .
you want me to have bigger titties?
what?
no , no .
it's a clothing line a beers clothing line .
no , dude , that's against the baseketball bylaws .
not if the proceeds go to charity .
think about it .
miss reed's foundation will never have to worry about funding again .
awesome , dude !
i think we should definitely do it !
'scuse us .
will you let me do the talking here?
there's no way i'm doing any kind of deal with this piece of shit .
wait , i thought it was we .
remember , it's not just up to you anymore .
all right , we can come up with a better way to get money for jenna .
like , how?
see?
thought so .
mr. cain?
hmm?
as part owner of the beers , i'd just like to say , where do i sign?
congratulations , don .
this is gonna change your life .
i look out for my " wimmins " !
before we discuss fabric or color ,
freedom !
freedom ! we gotta decide where we can make this stuff cheap .
we'll do a big media blitz .
and don't worry about coop .
he'll come around .
i'm a scat man
hi there , i'm dan patrick .
and i'm kenny mayne .
with the first seven months of the baseketball post season out of the way , the play off picture is now starting to emerge .
so with last night's victory over boston , next week the beers must beat lndianapolis ... to advance to charlotte that's in an effort to reduce their magic number to three .
right , and the beers can advance to the national eastern division north to play tampa .
so , if the beers beat detroit and denver beats atlanta ... in the american southwestern division east northern , then milwaukee goes to the denslow cup , unless baltimore upsets buffalo and charlotte ties toronto .
then oakland would play l. a. and pittsburgh in a blind choice round robin .
if no clear winner emerges from all this , the two man sack race will be held ...
on consecutive sundays till a champion is crowned .
right .
dude !
dude !
dude !
after the grueling , regular baseketball season , we're now in month nine of the play offs .
no , daddy , don't touch me there !
the beers , vying with san francisco ... for a slot in the denslow cup game .
ninth inning , ferries up by one , coop steps in .
it's back , way back

ladies and gentlemen , welcome to calcutta lnternational airport , where it is currently 95 degrees with a light drizzle .
we hope you enjoy your stay here in lovely calcutta .
taxi !
amoka , come on !
aw , c'mon !
driver , i'm in a hurry !
look , just take me to 7 1 1 aw !
here you are , beerswear factory .
hey , you , is this  i'm sorry , no entrance
who the hell are you?
i factory manager .
who you?
i joe cooper i mean , i'm joe cooper .
wait , mr. cooper , you must put on hard hat !
aw , this is awful .
aw , this isn't good !
do any authorities know about this?
aw !
aw !
wait , wait , please , mr. cooper !
put that down !
a young man .
his whole life in front of him disappears .
a familiar story , yes .
but this is no ordinary joe .
joseph r. cooper , perhaps the most loved sports figure in the country vanished .
according to mrs. elsie melcher , a neighbor who asked not to be identified ,
joe cooper left his house two weeks ago .
according to angelique bones , a nosy bitch who lives up the street , he took with him only a toothbrush , a wallet , a steamer trunk and a plane ticket to calcutta .
police theorize several possible scenarios of what happened ... to the man affectionately known to the world as " coop .
i don't know where the hell he is .
for all i care , he could be hanging by his neck in his fuckin 'closet .
he's hanging by his neck in his fucking closet .
the night before his disappearance , coop's girlfriend had paid him a visit .
according to friends , they had quarreled .
if you're looking for joe cooper , i suggest you look wherever you find ... the most heinous , blatant and vile exploitation of children on the planet .
coop went to disney world .
here's a photograph of joe cooper taken just days before his disappearance .
here's a computer enhanced simulation of what he might look like today .
from milwaukee , wisconsin , on the shores of lake michigan , it's the denslow cup , where the defending champion dallas felons ... meet their perennial challengers the milwaukee beers .
hello , i'm ai michaels along with bob costas inviting you ... to join us here at beers garden for denslow cup v.
and we're in for a classic battle tonight .
you're absolutely right about that , al .
we have over a hundred million people throughout the world tuned in to see this game .
many of them , of course , with no understanding of the sport itself , but nonetheless fascinated by the flickering images and the bright , pretty colors .
high up in the stands , pyrotechnic expert sergio " lucky " ferouch ... is readying another spectacular , halftime fireworks display .
all right , you guys .
you ready to kick some ass?
what's wrong , you guys?
why the long faces?
we miss coop .
can't win without him .
we don't need coop .
i'll lead you to victory !
we're supposed to be a team .
without coop it's not the same .
look , even if coop was to walk in here right now , it wouldn't change the outcome of this game one iota .
we can win this thing !
are you with me?
yeah , yeah !
that's the spirit .
are you with me?
yeah !
yeah !
all right , coop's here !
we're underway here for denslow cup v.
a stunned crowd of over 18, 000 witnessing the beers ... being thoroughly dominated by the felons .
come on , beers !
go , coop !
hey , guys , thought i told you we weren't gonna watch this game .
oh , come on , miss reed .
it's the denslow cup !
these are not the kind of people to be looked up to or emulated .
the severed and mutilated head was postmarked denver .
the owner still has not stepped forward .
the disappearance of the milwaukee beers baseketball star .
when joe cooper discovered that the workers in the beerswear factory were youngsters , not even old enough for prostitution , he personally flew to calcutta .
his new , all adult workforce now makes a decent wage , enjoys full medical benefits and in house child care .
all of us here are glad that such a terrific human being like joe cooper has returned .
if i were a woman , i'd sure like to be his girlfriend .
walking in the park , hand in hand , wrapping my legs around him , cuddling in the spoon position , our hearts beating in unison , staring into his eyes over our morning coffee
uh , yes , yes , thank you .
when we come back , our next unsolved mystery  come on , kids .
we're going to the game !
yea !
ladies and gentlemen , for your seventh inning stretch entertainment ,
viva calypso !
we're up 16 nothing at the break .
have the trucks pull up to the locker room .
we'll sort out the stuff when we get to jacksonville .
okay .
hey , baxter .
i finally got all the chrome off this for you .
nice .
very nice .
you want me to start on this one?
ladies and gentlemen , please direct your attention now ... to the malaka laka balance board of trust , symbol of brotherhood in many polynesian countries .
assuming the roles of the downtrodden but happy natives , with their good luck pineapple , your milwaukee beers !
thanks for flying back , coop .
you really made a big difference in the score .
if i wouldn't have been cleaning up your mess , i wouldn't be jet lagged and shitting curry !
hey , guys , knock it off , all right?
representing their white colonial oppressors , the dallas felons !
and now , let's all join our caribbean brothers ... in the ceremonial south sea handshake above the lagoon of peace .
all right , let go !
you let go !
stop it .
stop it !
guys , come on , man !
money grubber !
powermonger !
cock !
guys , stop it !
whoa !
hey !
you son of a bitch !
you asshole !
die !
eat shit !
hey !
would you just stop it?
would you hold on a minute?
hey !
would you just stop it?
would you hold on a minute?
look at you guys , fighting on the malaka laka board !
you should be ashamed of yourselves !
back in the driveway , we were nothing !
now we've risen to the highest level , but you're throwin 'it all away !
if you've forgotten what baseketball means to america , you have only to look at this board the malaka laka balance board of trust .
don't you see what we have here?
a game where guys with bad backs and bad knees ... can get together and compete on the same field ... as guys that are all goosed up on steroids .
but more than anything , isn't this game about gettin 'together with your friends and havin 'a good time?
i remember
i remember a long time ago , i didn't have anybody .
you guys took me in .
i guess that's why it kills me to see you like this .
if we can't be friends , then the heart and soul are out of this game .
certainly out of me !
i know i'll never get that back again .
we have sullied the waters of the lagoon of peace !
i'm begging you , for the love of our caribbean brothers , dudes , stop this madness !
hang on !
oh , my god !
remember to hold your breath just before we hit !
never let go !
bob , this has to be the most spectacular extravaganza i have ever seen !
you can cram three seats into the space it takes for one wheelchair , not to mention the wasted space it takes for the oxygen bottle .
hell , those little shits never pay full price anyway !
baxter !
i just realized i can't stand you !
you can kiss these puppies good bye !
oh .
shit , coop .
i'm sorry .
i guess the money did go to my head .
no , l i'm sorry , remer .
i think i've got a lot to learn about sharing .
look at me .
i've become everything i used to hate .
maybe we we just grew up too fast .
my worst enemy turned out to be me .
dude .
dude .
dude .
dude .
hey , puck , i've got two over
all right , let's go win ourselves a championship !
yeah !
she was a little green
he was just a little mean
they were together all the time
so now no one can forget this thing that happens all the time
she would do anything
yo , darcy .
yeah?
hey , that's my wife !
yeah , and this is me !
they live together all the time
so now no one can forget this little thing
that's on her mind
it's a waste to wonder what's a heart these days
it takes a lot to get up and just leave those who
hey , dirk !
what is it?
i hear your sister's goin 'out with squeak !
aaah !
and squeak scolari crosses the plate again ... as the beers have come roaring back since the break .
bob , this is more like the beers team we've seen all season .
ninth inning , two outs .
beers still down by two runs .
felons on first and third .
the beers have to stop dallas here if they want to stay in this game .
and the always dangerous grumsky coming up .
get this guy , coop .
he hasn't missed a shot all night .
i know , but i don't know what to say .
nothing works on him .
hey !
tell him he's fat !
dude , that's not cool .
yeah , it is .
that's not cool .
no , no , no .
just do it really subtle .
subtle .
hey , grumsky , you losin 'weight?
oh , big ass !
you're fuckin 'fat .
you're goddamn fuckin 'fat .
how'd you get so goddamn fuckin 'fat?
the beers hold them in the ninth on a clutch psych out ... by " coop " cooper .
coop !
coop !
coop !
coop !
coop !
coop !
bottom of the ninth .
dallas , 16 .
milwaukee , 14 .
remer on second , scolari on third .
coop's coming up .
and so , it all comes down to this one shot .
coop makes it , the beers win the cup , and get to keep the team .
or , he misses .
coop !
coop !
coop !
oh , my god .
la z boy has popped !
the ball coop has used every day of his career is gone , and a time out has been called as the beers star tries to regroup .
excuse me , driver , do you think you could go any faster?
could i go any faster?
yea !
hang on !
yea !
whoa !
no doubt about it , al .
the loss of this ball is going to affect the outcome of this game .
ow !
hey !
come on , kids !
thomas , where are you going?
it's just one shot .
you can do it !
we can win this thing !
come on , coop !
you can do it .
coop !
stop !
don't shoot !
wait !
joey !
here .
i brought this for you .
i made it myself .
just like you .
dude , you made this?
well , miss reed helped me for most of it .
but i finished it myself .
joey , this is great .
coop , you know what miss reed told me tonight?
she said she wants me to be a big sports star .
just like joe cooper .
thanks , dude .
go get 'em , coop !
hey , coop !
when's the last time you made a home run without la z boy?
al , we have seen some classic denslow cup battles in the past , but i can't remember one that ever rivaled ... the drama and excitement of this one .
it's off the rim !
could be a double play .
darcy tips .
jantzen's try no .
beers have a shot at the conversion .
remer keeps it alive !
last chance .
coop up .
it's ... good !
bob , in all my years of calling games ,
i don't think i've ever been this excited !
you're excited?
feel these nipples !
we still have no fucking clue where this guy is .
i can wear anything and i can be anything
tonight i don't wanna feel wonderful
tonight i don't wanna feel bad
'cause tonight will be the night of my dreams
tonight i don't wanna feel anything
and then things moved in took no time at all
tonight i don't wanna feel wonderful
hey , ho !
hey !
ho !
all right .
coop , what?
what is it?
it's reggie .
reggie jackson .
well , go .
go ahead .
reggie .
coop .
nice goin 'out there .
thanks , man .
but you know , i gotta tell you .
it's 'cause of you that i'm here .
that's nice to know .
i brought this for you .
i saw some kid try to leave the ballpark with it .
you gotta hang on to that .
i got the two home run balls i hit in the world series .
some wretched little shit got the third one .
that sucks , dude .
i gotta get my trophy .
maybe we can have a hot dog sometime?
all right , sounds good .
hey , coop !
i don't have your fuckin 'ball !
good luck next year .
oh .
thanks .
hey , baxter !
got milk?
oh , i'm sorry !
and so , on behalf of the national baseketball league , we'd like to present to the beers this year's denslow cup .
congratulations !
go ahead , take your victory lap .
as they skate off , all you can think about is a team that conquered adversity , a team that overcame the odds , a team that defied the critics , a team that blah , blah , blah , blah , a team that , uh
and so , the ideal of sports once again blossomed from a tiny seed , nurtured , as always , by the dreams of the young .
yeah !
i'm the king of the world !
