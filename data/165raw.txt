i remembermymother when she was dying .
looked all shrunk up andgrey .
i askedherifshe was afraid .
sheijustshook herhead .
i was afraid to touch the death lseen in her .
i heard people talk about immortality , but i ain't seen it .
i wonderedhowit'dbe when i died .
what it'dbe like to know that this breath now was the last one you was evergonna draw .
lijusthope i can meetit the same wayshe did .
with the same ... calm .
cos that's where it's hidden the immortalitylhadn'tseen .
kids around here never fight .
sometimes .
sometimes when you see them playing they always fight !
is she afraid of me?
little bit .
are you afraid of me?
yes .
why?
cos you iook ...
you iook as an army !
i iook army?
yes .
weil , that don't matter .

we can't aii be smart .
no , we can't , and that's a shame .
look at you .
truth is , you can't take straight duty in my company .
you'ii never be a reai soldier , not in god's world .
this is c company , of which i'm first sergeant .
i run this outfit .
captain staros , he's the co , but i'm the guy who runs it .
nobody's gonna foui that up .
you're just another mouth for me to feed .
normaily , you'd be court martiailed .
but i worked a deai for ya .
gotta consider yourself iucky .
i'm sending you to a disciplinary outfit .
you'ii be a stretcher bearer .
you'ii be taking care ofthe wounded .
i can take anything you dish out .
i'm twice the man you are .
in this world ... a man himself is nothing .
and there ain't no world but this one .
you're wrong there , top .
i seen another world .
sometimes i think it was just ... my imagination .
weil , then you've seen things i never wiil .
we're iiving in a world that's blowing itself to heii as fast as everybody can arrange it .
in a situation iike that aii a man can do is shut his eyes and iet nothing touch him .
look out for himself .
i might be the best friend you ever had .
you don't even know it .
he hates you worse than poison .
i never felt he hated me , cos i don't hate him .
i love charlie company .
they're my people .
they caii it " the rock " .
nobody wants this island .
japs just put an airfield there .
fighting's confined to this area .
this is their road to australia , and this is their way of controiling the sea ianes to america .
if we're gonna stop the japs 'advance into the south pacific , we've gotta do it right there .
the marines have done theirjob .
now it's our turn .
worked myass off .
brown nosed the generals .
degraded myself for them andmyfamily .
for myhome .
i admire you , colonel .
i do .
thank you , sir .
most men your age would have retired by now .
it's ok .
we need generai officers with maturity and character iike you .
we've got good sergeants and good iieutenant colonels .
but once a man gets those eagles , he can't wait to get that star .
he becomes a politician , right?
goes along to get along .
so goddamn hard to stay upright .
you said it there , sir .
with the admirai watching , which he wiii be .
there's always someone watching .
yeah .
like a hawk .
always someone ready to jump in , if you're not .
d'you have a son , colonel?
yes , sir .
good .
we don't want our sons or grandsons fighting this war 30 years from now , do we?
no , sir , we sure don't .
then you crush 'em without mercy .
you dig them out ofthe hiils and protect that airfield .
yes , sir .
you wonder why ...
why did the japs put an airfield there of aii places?
i guess we don't know the bigger picture , if there is such a thing .
what do you think?
weil , sir , i never ask myselfthat question .
you're a humble man .
nobody wants that island ... but you .
how much do you want it?
as much as i have to , sir .
poured outlike water on the ground .
all lmighthave given forlove's sake .
too late .
died ... slow as a tree .
d'you feei it?

the closeryou are to caesar , the greater the fear .
i just can't help how damn scared i am , sarge , aii right?

i got ...
my stepdaddy took a block and beat me when i was reai iittle and i was scared and i used to run , i used to hide .
heil , i slept in the chicken coop a whole iot of nights .
and i never thought it'd get no worse than that .
but i'm iiving by the ... by the minute here .
i'm counting the seconds .
heil , we're gonna be ianding soon and there's gonna be air raids .
we're probably gonna die before we get offthe beach .
this place is ...
it's iike a big floating graveyard .
what's your name , kid?
i wanna own an automobile when i get out .
what's your name?
edward , edward b train .
train?
the only things that are permanent is , is dying and the lord .
that's it .
that's aii you gotta worry about .
this war ain't ... gonna be the end of me or you neither .
think we'ii catch an air raid?
how in the heii should i know?
ail's i know are them crew guys said they didn't catch no air raid the iast time .
on the other hand , time before iast they nearly got blew up .
what d'you want me to teii you?
you're a big help , tiils .

i never bargained for nothing iike this when i signed up for this man's army before the war .
how was i supposed to know there was gonna be a fuckin 'war , huh?
answer me that .
aii i know is charlie company's always getting screwed .
always .
and i can teii you whose fault it is , too .
it's that captain of ours .
first he gets us stuck off on this boat where we don't know a fucking soul .
then he gets us stuck way down in fourth place on the iist to get offthis son of a bitch .
heilo , captain .
i read in your 201 file that you were an officer before the war .
how'd you end up a private?
cos of my wife .
i was in the corps of engineers .
we'd never been separated before , not even for a night .
i took it for four months and then i quit .
just resigned .
they sent me back to the states .
they told me i'd never get another commission .
they said they'd see to it i got drafted and that i for damn sure'd be in the infantry .
sons of bitches .
no , i don't blame them .
weil , where is she now?

some oii drums .
there'd be nothing there for ...
a week .
a week , sir .
no casualties .
japs must've hauled ass .
two mortars hit the beach , but most guys came in standing up .
darnedest thing i ever did see .
they got fish that iive in trees .
if they didn't know this beach was deserted , what else don't they know?
who are you to live in all these manyforms?

maybe all men got one big soul who everybody's a part of .
all faces ofthe same man .
one big self .
everyone looking forsalvation byhimself .
each like a coal drawn from the fiire .
we're going straight up that hiii there .
we can't do that , colonel .
weil , there's no way to outflank it .
on the ieft is a cliff that fails down into the river .
the japanese hold the jungle .
it has to be taken frontaily .
what about water , sir?
it's not getting up here .
my men are ... passing out , sir .
only time you worry about a soldier is when he stops bitching .
we're aii gonna attack abreast .
third platoon in reserve .
we've gotta cross those three folds of ground .
you see?
once we get beyond that , we gotta attack that hiil .
colonei says there's no way to outflank it , so we gotta take it head on by frontai assault .
whyte?
yeah?
see the grassy ridges at the foot ofthat hiil?
yeah .
when you get to the end ofthat field , eliminate aii strongpoints on those ridges .
i'm sure the japs got something there to protect the approaches .
are you here?
let me not betray you .
let me not betray my men .
in you i place my trust .
rosy fingered dawn .
you're greek , aren't you , captain?

no , but it bucks the men up .
it'ii iook iike the japs are catching heil .
ok , you guys .
this is it .
we're going down in groups often .
there's no point in going by rushes .
only make a better target stopped , so ... run aii the way .

anyway , it's better than going back down .
something's coming !
they're coming !
what are they doin '?
if they want to throw us out , why didn't they come in force?
maybe they was acting on their own .
maybe they wanted to get into nirvana .

i'm gonna mention you in orders tomorrow and recommend you for the silver star .
it's the most courageous thing ...
captain , you say one more word to thank me , i'ii knock you right in the teeth .
you mention me in your fuckin 'orders , and i'ii resign so fast and ieave you here to run this busted up outfit by yourself .
you understand?
property !
whole fuckin 'thing's about property .
what's the matter with you , staros?
those men should be reinforced immediately !
what are they doing?
i can see 'em through my glasses .
they're lying behind thatledge !
they shouldbe up and out , cleaning out those machine guns !
over !
i don't think you understand what's going on , sir .
we've had ... heavy casualties .
we had a man ...
his gut got shot out on the slopes , sir .
created quite an upset .
fine , fine .
now , what about those reinforcements?
over .
i have ... two squads to ...
first platoon i can send up , sir .
over .
what the heii do you mean , two squads? !
goddamn you , staros !
when lsayreinforcements , goddamn it , i mean it !
you commit everybody you have there and do it now !
your firstplatoon , too . lsee 'em lying on their fatasses doing nothing .
get a man to 'em right now with orders to attack , and move 'em by the flank to the ridge .
then get that second platoon over to the hiil !
have 'em press the centre .
go straight up that goddamn hiil !
attack them right now !
jesus , staros !
do lhave to give you a lesson on infantry tactics while yourmen are getting their asses shot off? .
colonel , i don't think you fuily understand what is going on here .
my company alone cannot take that position , sir .
the japs are too weii dug in .
they've got too much fire power .
colonel , there's a bunker up there .
we can't see it , and it's ... it's chewing my men to pieces , sir .
i request permission for patroi reconnaissance around to the right ofhill 210 .
i believe the entire position , sir , can be outflanked with a manoeuvre there in force .
no !
goddamn it , no !
mightsave lives !
there'ii be no flanking move .
listen , staros .
you're notgonna take yourmen around into the jungle to avoid a goddamn fight !
do you hear me , staros?
i want you to attack right now with every man at your disposal !
now , attack , staros !
that's a direct order !
sir , i must teii you that i refuse to obey your order .
there it is , right there .
see it?
i don't see it .
this is not your fault , jim .
he's ordering you to .
i again request permission for patroi reconnaissance around to the right in force .
the time , sir , ... is 1321 hours , 25 seconds .
i have two witnesses here .
i request that you do the same with witnesses there .
over .
staros , don't puii this guardhouse iawyer builshit with me !
now , lknowyou're a goddamn lawyer !
this is nota court oflaw .
this is a war .
it's a goddamn battle !
now , i want that frontai attack .
i repeat my order .
over .
colonel , i refuse to take my men up there in a frontai attack .
it's suicide , sir .
i've iived with these men for two years , and i wiii not order them aii to their deaths .
over .
this is a very important decision , staros .
but ifyou feel thatstrongly , maybe you have a reason , so i'm coming down .
go take a iook .
i'm not rescinding my order to you , son , but if i find extenuating circumstances when i get there , i'ii take that into account .
now , in the meantime , goddamn it , i want you to hold on untii i get there .
and , ifpossible , you get those men on the ridge outandmoving !
out .
one spot's as good as another , men .
there's no place to hide .
just take it easy , son .
take it easy .
take it easy .
where's ... where's fife?
fife?
he's right here , son .
fife .
hold my hand , fife .
hold my hand .
i got it .
i'm dying , fife .
oh , captain ...
shut up in a tomb .
can't lift the lid .
played a role lnever conceived .
get that blouse on , soldier .
it's not a goddamn bathing beach !
put it on right now .
what you aiming at , son?
let's go get those son of a bitches .
move up !
what are you doing iaying down there where you can't see a damn thing?
observing , sir .
just sent first platoon forward to the ridge .
how many of 'em were hit this time?
none , sir .
none?
not one?
doesn't sound iike the situation you described to me over the sound power .
weil , it's not .
the situation's changed just in the iast five minutes , sir .
captain , you iisten to me .
we're going over there and taking everybody with us .
do you have any more complaints or demurrers?
no , sir .
not now .
aii right !
we're gonna do things my way !
my way !
you understand that , captain?
we're taking everybody over to that iedge !
we may take that ridge by nightfail !
i think the ridge is quite a way from being reduced , sir .
show me how to see things the way you do .
show me how to see things the way you do .
we're just dirt .
we're just dirt .
we're gonna get kiiled ifwe stay here .
beil , take six men and go see what's up there .
and we'ii cover you the best we can from down there .
ok .
you guys , you guys , stay here .
ok?
i'm going alone .
come out .
come out where lam .
there was a ...
there was a ...
there's a bunker ... up there .
it's five guns .
it's five guns .
that strongpoint up there , somewhere up there around those rocks , is the key to this ridge .
beii here is quite right .
from their knob up there , those iittle brown brothers can cover the whole ofthe ground in front ofthis position for 1, 000 yards .
they've ieft this iedge unguarded .
now , goddamn it , that's a mistake .
that's a heii of a mistake .
we need to take advantage of it before they see their error .
aii right , aii right , i know you're aii pretty exhausted , and we've had a heii of a time getting water up here .
for that i'm sorry .
i apologise to you ail .
but ifwe can reduce this bunker tomorrow , i think we can take this ridge .
so i'm asking for volunteers .
go back up there and knock it out .
sir?
i'ii be glad to go back up
and iead the way back for a party .
right .
i'ii go , sir .
you .
aii right .
i'd iike to iead the party , colonel .
aii right , john .
i was hoping you'd say that .
you'ii be in command .
i'ii go , sir .
sir?
you .
aii right , men , that's enough .
seven is plenty .
gather up .
i don't know ifyou realise the importance of this operation , staros .
once our position is secured , we can move the bombers in .
that means air power for 1, 000 miles in every direction .
guadalcanai may be the turning point in the war .
it'ii cost iives .
is that what's troubling you?
no , sir .
i explained to you the importance ofthis objective .
how many men do you think it's worth?
how many iives?
i can't say , sir .
are you prepared to sacrifice the iives of any ofyour men in this campaign?
