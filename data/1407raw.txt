i'm , uh , jerry lundegaard .
you're jerry lundegaard?
yah .
shep proudfoot said shep said you'd be here at 7 : 30 .
what gives , man?
shep said 8 : 30 .
we've been sitting here an hour?
he's peed three times already .
oh , i'm sure sorry .
shep told me 8 : 30 .
it was a mix up , i guess?
you got the car?
yah , you bet .
it's out in the lot there .
brand new burnt umber ciera .
yeah , okay?
well , sit down , then .
i'm carl showalter .
this is my associate gaear grimsrud .
yeah , how you doin '?
so
we all set on this thing , then?
sure , jerry .
we're all set?
why wouldn't we be?
yeah no , i'm sure you are .
shep vouched for you and all .
i got every confidence here in you fellas .
i guess that's it , then?
here are the keys .
no , that's not it , jerry?
hah?
the new vehicle plus $40, 000 .
yeah , but the deal was the car first , then the 40, 000 , like as if it was the ransom .
i thought shep told ya .
shep didn't tell us much , jerry?
well , okay .
except that you were gonna be here at 7 : 30 .
yeah , well , that was a mix up , then?
yeah , you already said that .
yeah , but it's not a whole pay in advance deal .
see , i give you a brand new vehicle in advance , and then i'm not gonna debate you , jerry .
okay .
i'm not gonna sit here and debate .
i will say this , though .
what shep told us didn't make a whole lotta sense .
oh , no .
it's real sound?
it's all worked out .
you want your own wife kidnapped .
yeah .
you
my point is , you pay the ransom what , 80, 000 bucks?
i mean , you give us half the ransom , 40, 000 .
you keep half .
it's like robbin 'peter to pay paul .
it doesn't make any sense .
okay .
see , it's not me payin 'the ransom .
the thing is , my wife , she's wealthy .
her dad , he's real well off?

why don't you just ask him for the money?
or your fuckin 'wife , you know?
or your fucking wife , jerry .
well , it's all part of this
they don't know i need it , see .
okay , so there's that?
and even if they did , i wouldn't get it .

stan and i are okay?
yah?
we're good to load in?

but we never talked about your fee for bringing it to us .
no !
but , wade , see , i was bringing you this deal ...
for you to loan me the money to put in .
it's my deal here , see .
jerry , we thought you were bringing us an investment .
yah , right .
you're sayin '
what are you sayin '?
you're sayin 'we put in all the money , and you collect when it pays off .
no , no?
but i i'd
i'd pay you back the principal and interest .
heck , i'd i'd go ..?
one over prime?
we're not a bank , jerry?

i'd go to midwest federal , talk to old bill diehl .
he's at norstar?
he's at

but , see , i
i don't need a finder's fee .
i need
a finder's fee's , what , ten percent?
heck , that's not gonna do it for me .
i need the principal .
well , jerry , we're not just gonna give ya $750, 000 .
what the heck were you thinkin '?
if i'm only gettin 'bank interest , i want complete security .
heck , f. d. i. c. i don't see nothin 'like that here .
yeah , but i

i'm not talkin 'about your damn word , jerry .
jeez !
what the heck
we're not a bank , jerry .
well , look , i don't wanna cut you out of the loop , but this here's a good deal .
i assume , if you're not interested , you won't mind if we move in on it ...
independently .
damn it !
hon !

i never put my tags on the car .
all right , don't worry .

you're required to display temporary tags ...
either in the plate area or taped to the inside of the back window .
certainly?
can i see your license and registration?
certainly .
yeah , i was gonna tape up those the tag .
you know , to be in full compliance , but , uh
it must've , uh must've slipped my mind .
so maybe the best thing to do ...
would be to take care of that right here in brainerd .
what's this , sir?
my license and registration .
yeah , i wanna be in compliance .
i was just thinking we could take care of it right here ...
in brainerd .
put that back in your pocket , please , and step out of the car , please , sir .
shut the fuck up !
whoa .
whoa , daddy .
you'll take care of it .

where is everybody?
well it's cold , margie .
watch your step , margie .
ah , jeez .
so
ah , jeez !
here's the second one !
it's in the head and the hand there .
i guess that's a defensive wound?
oh , yah?
where's the state trooper?
back there a good piece in the ditch next to his prowler .
okay .
so we got a trooper pull someone over , we got a shooting , these folks drive by , there's a high speed pursuit , ends here , and then this execution type deal .
yah .
i'd be very surprised if our suspect was from brainerd .
yah .
and i'll tell ya what .
from his footprint , he looks like a big fella .
you see somethin 'down there , chief?
no .
i just think i'm gonna barf .
jeez .
you okay , margie?
yeah , i'm fine .
it's just morning sickness .
well , that passed .
yah?
yeah .
now i'm hungry again .
you have breakfast yet , margie?
oh , yah .
norm made some eggs?
yah?
well
what now do you think?
let's go take a look at that trooper .
there's different footprints here , lou?
yah?
yah .
this guy's smaller than his buddy .
oh , yah?
for pete's sake?
how's it look , marge?
well , he's got his gun on his hip there , and ...
he looks like a nice enough guy .
tsk?
it's a real shame .
yah .
didn't monkey with his car there , did ya?
no way .
well , somebody shut his lights .
i guess the little guy sat in there , waiting for his buddy to come back .
yeah , it would've been cold out here .
heck , yeah?
you think is dave open yet?
dave?
oh , you don't think he's mixed up in
oh , no , no .
i just wanna get norm some night crawlers .
did you look in his citation book?
yeah .
last vehicle he wrote in ...
was a tan ciera at 2 : 18 a . m .
under plate number , he put " d. l. r.
i figure they stopped him or ...
shot him before he could finish filling out the tag number?
uh huh .
so i got the state looking for a ciera with a tag startin 'd. l. r.
they don't got no match yet .
i'm not sure that i agree with you 100 % ...
on your police work there , lou .
yah?
yah .
i think that vehicle there probably had dealer plates .
d. l. r.?
oh .
jeez .
say , lou .
d'you hear the one about the guy couldn't afford personalized plates ...
so he went and changed his name to " j3l 2404 "?
yah?
that's a good one .
look , alls i know is , you got a problem , you call a professional !
no !
they said no cops?
they were darn clear on that , wade .
they said , " you call your cops , and we're gonna shoot
of course they're gonna say that !
where's my protection?
they got jean here .
i give these sons of bitches $1 million , where's my guarantee they're gonna let her go?
well , they $1 million is a lot of damn money .
yeah , but think this there they are .
they got my daughter .
think this thing through here , wade .
you give 'em what they want , why won't they let her go?
you gotta listen to me on this one , wade .
ah , heck?
you don't know .
you're just whistling dixie here .
i'm sayin 'the cops , they can advise us on this .
i'm sayin 'call a professional?
no !
no cops !
that's final .
this is my deal here , wade .
jean is my wife here .
i gotta tell you , wade .
i'm leaning to jerry's viewpoint here .
well we gotta protect jean .
these
we're not holding any cards here , wade .
they got 'em all , so they call the shots .
you're darn tootin '?
ah , damn it !
i'm tellin 'ya?
well , why why don't we
stan , i'm thinkin 'we should offer 'em a half million , okay?
now , come on here !
no way , wade !
no way !
we're not horse tradin 'here , wade?
yeah .
we gotta just bite the bullet on this thing?
yeah .
so , uh , what's the next step here , jerry?
they're gonna call me up and give me instructions for a drop .
i'm supposed to have the money ready tomorrow?
damn it !
how was everything today?
yah .
real good , now .
how you doin '?
okay .
now , we'll get the money together .
don't worry about it , jerry .
now , do you want anyone at home with ya till they call?
no .
i they don't want
they were just supposed to be dealing with me .
they were real clear .
yeah?
you know , they said no one listenin 'in .
they'll be watchin ', you know .
maybe it's all bull , but like you said , stan , they're callin 'the shots .
okay .
now , is , uh , is scotty gonna be all right?
yeah , jeez , scotty .
yeah .
i'll go talk to him .
how you doin 'there , scotty?
dad , what are they doin '?
what do you think they're doin 'with mom?
it's okay , scotty .
they're not gonna wanna hurt her any .
these men , they they just want money .
yeah , what if somethin 'goes wrong , dad , and then no , no .
nothing's goin 'wrong here?
granddad and i , we're , um
we're makin 'sure this gets handled right .
i really think we should call the cops here .
no , no .
no one can know about this thing .
we gotta play ball with these guys .
you ask stan grossman , he'll tell you the same thing .
yeah , but , dad we're gonna get mom back for ya , but we gotta play ball , you know?
that's the deal here .
so if if lorraine calls or sylvia , you just say mom's down in florida with pearl and marty .
that's the best we can do here .

now , i know you've had some problems
struggling with the narcotics , some other entanglements , currently on parole .
so?
well , associating with criminals , if you're the one they talked to , that right there would be a violation of your parole .
would end you up back in stillwater .

i know you don't wanna be an accessory to something like that .
so , you think you might remember who those folks were who called ya?

and i says , " yah , but this ain't that kind of place .
uh huh?
he says , " oh , so i get it .
so you think i'm some kind of jerk for askin '.
only he don't use the word " jerk .
i understand .
then he calls me a jerk?
says last guy who thought he's a jerk is dead now .

he says , " what do you think about that?
and i says , " well , that don't sound like too good a deal for him , then .
you got that right?

he says , " yeah , that guy's dead , and i don't mean of old age .
and then he says , " jeez , i'm goin 'crazy out there at the lake .
white bear lake?
yeah .
well , at ecklund and swedlin , that's closer to moose lake , so i made that assumption .
oh , sure?
anyway , he's drinking at the bar , so i don't think a whole great deal of it .
but then mrs. mohra , she heard about the homicides down here ...
and thought i should call it in , so i called it in .
