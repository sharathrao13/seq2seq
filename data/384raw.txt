this is a transmitter .
i took this off gideon's dead body ... ... dr. kendricks 'good friend .
you have any more of these here?
why would anybody wanna transmit our position?
transmit our position to over 300 nigerian soldiers ... ... who ran all night ... ... to get to within an hour and a half of where we are now?
red .
somebody's gonna tell me .
somebody's gonna start talking right now .
because if they don't tell me what i want to know ... ... by the time i count to five ... ... l'm gonna kill someone else .
one .
two .
three .
don't fuck with me .
four .
please .
please .
there's no need for this .
please .
now you got something to say to me , don't you?
my name is arthur azuka .
i'm the only son of president samuel azuka .
please don't blame them .
please .
i'm sorry to have misled you ... ... but there are enemies looking for me everywhere .
that is why you're being pursued .
our report said the entire presidential family was executed .
your reports were incorrect .
they were not executed .
they murdered my father ... ... along with my mother ... ... and my two ... ... younger sisters ... ... out of greed ... ... and my father's fight for democracy for his people .
my people .
when it first appeared there might be trouble ... ... my father sent me away with this man .
col. okeze .
lieutenant , his father was more than the president .
he was the tribal king .
that makes him the heir to the lbo nation .
it's a bloodline they must cut .
the fulanis will comb heaven and earth to find him .
you knew about this?
you knew all the time , and you didn't tell me .
i didn't trust you ... ... at the time .
i wonder what it takes to earn your trust .
red , lake .
tell them to pack their things .
we're leaving .
men , give them their weapons .
we're moving out of here .
pack up your things .
come on .
move it out !
get in , get out .
okay?
come on .
move it .
move it .
come on .
see you .
hurry back .
back in formation .
they must continue their route to the tandjile pass or they'll lose a day .
so they must come out here , near the cameroon border .
no !
how many men do you have in gashanka?
right on time .
good hustle , red .
come on up and brief zee .
this river will get us straight into cameroon .
they'll be expecting us .
what do you think?
i think we're fucked either way we go .
we backtrack , cross downstream ... ... come up , go through the jungle and rip right into cameroon .
roger that .
let the other men know .
yes , sir .
good job .
l. t.
what do you got?
rhodes on the phone .
yes , sir , captain , this is waters .
lntel reports military elements in your sector ... ... conducting search and destroy of a u. s. military unit ... ... moving with arthur azuka , son of the late president .
what can you tell me?
yes , sir , we just discovered that ourselves .
he and his bodyguard hid themselves within dr. kendricks 'refugee party .
that's a major problem , lieutenant .
he involves your mission in the internal politics of a foreign nation ... ... affecting u. s. diplomacy and seriously increases the mission's risk .
he's considered a criminal by the new regime .
he's a major liability .
what exactly does that mean , sir?
his party is excess cargo .
you mean he's not human , sir?
captain , this man is the lbo tribal leader .
do you know what that means?
cut the shit .
who do you think i am?
sir , we both know what'll happen to him if i leave him out here .
there won't be a trial or a jury .
outside the courthouse , they'll put two in his head .
i'm just asking for a little help here .
put yourself in my shoes , bill .
i've been in your shoes , lieutenant .
send in an air evac immediately and get all of us out of here , sir .
negative on air support at this time .
airspace is too hot .
your judgment has risked the lives of your men and the mission's success .
i advise you , complete the evacuation as planned !
do you read me? !
yes , sir , i read you .
loud and clear .
but i cannot , in good conscience , do that without taking these people to safety .
that's not your mission !
when have i not completed a mission?
my team will complete this mission .
i give you my word on that .
i don't like this .
get your ass back here alive soon as possible .
maintain contact with op center .
i'll direct air support as soon as i can .
i promise you .
yes , sir .
eagle one , out .
bring them up .
everybody up on l. t. now .
double time .
so much for diplomacy .
come on , let's go .
here's the deal .
it's been strongly suggested that we turn over arthur ... ... and abandon these refugees out here in the bush .
i'll tell you right now i'm not gonna do that .
i can't do that .
i broke my own rule .
i started to give a fuck ... ... and brought you guys along with me .
we're about to walk into some serious shit .
before we do , i'd just like ... ... to hear what you guys have to say about it .
that's all .
speak freely .
ln my opinion , sir ... ... we cut our losses .
this isn't our fucking war .
as far as me being in or out ... ... you know the answer to that .
let's get these people to safety .
let's finish the job .
i can't leave them , sir .
i'm good to go .
what about you , red?
i can't look at them like packages anymore .
i'm gonna get them out ... ... or i'm going to die trying .
are we there yet?
thanks , fellas .
strip those packs down to rolling gear only .
have the refugees drop anything that don't go " boom . " let's move .
double time .
let's go .
hustle .
l. t ... ... those africans are my people too .
for all the years that we were told to stand down and to stand by ... ... you're doing the right thing .
for our sins .
hooyah .
hooyah .
we gotta go .
let's go .
lieutenant .
i'm sorry i didn't tell you about arthur .
i should have trusted you .
it's not your fault .
i would've done the same thing if i was in your position .
i wouldn't have trusted me either .
i'm gonna get your people to cameroon .
i promise .
come on .
we gotta hurry .
