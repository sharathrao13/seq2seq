subtitles by johnny depp
on may 9 , 1969 , a mile from the northern border of laos , the 101st us army lnfantry division was advancing on hill 937 .
for them , it was just a recon mission .
for the vietcong , hill 937 was a strategic point .
the dozen soldiers in the company , new to combat , were to complete this routine mission in two hours .
they fought back heroically for 9 days .
this film does not tell their story .
the year is 35, 000 bc .
ln this untouched and savage world , mammoths live in peace with horsemoths ,
henmoths and wormoths .
oblivious to evil , fearing only the night , this is where our ancestors , the first men , lived .
all right ...
you know my wife?
yes , chief .
beautiful , isn't she?
right , roll call !
this is the stone age .
stone?
here !
stone?
here !
absent again , that one .
stone too , i suppose .
i knew it .
always off together .
this is nice .
it's nice being nice .
ever feel like not doing nothing?
no .
me neither .
a quick pus?
no thanks , i quit .
rest your head .
scared you'll mess your hair?
your hair's weird .
it's a period do .
wasn't it straight at school?
it's always been curly , like grandpa and dad .
my children and grandchildren were too !
just swallow it .
okay .
daddy !
hello , my chickadees !
stone , have they been good?
very .
just stoning each other as usual .
that's good .
just a second ...
there's one missing !
honey , didn't we have 12 kids this morning?
that's right .
a wild beast gobbled stone up .
i knew we had 12 .
come on , time for bed now .
off you go .
how much , stone?
one baby boarmoth a day .
so half a baby boarmoth .
dung !
i'm out of baby boarmoths .
that feels so good ...
take that thing .
keep the change .
it's getting all dark !
knock it off !
hurry , night is sprawling .
it's getting all dark !
knock it off !
it's getting all dark !
knock it off !
you kids can't watch the mural all night .
lights out .
nearby , among the barren red rocks ,
lives a tribe with dirty , muddy hair .
for centuries , the dirtyhairs have been at war with their neighbours , for the latter hold the secret of shampoo .
despite this ancient conflict , the cleanhairs feel on first name terms with happiness .
charge !
it really needs a hole .
baby , i'm home .
well?
failed again .
same here .
as usual .
the others?
all drowned .
what?
unky , unky , unky , aunty and unky?
unky too .
unky too?
we've lost half our family tree !
extinction looms .
just give the shampoo thing a rest .
i don't see why we can't manage it .
i just don't see why .
looks like the shit fairies blessed us .
this shampoo war has lasted 800 years .
800 years on the 25th .
we must break the circle of failure .
here's what i suggest .
what do you think?
you didn't say anything .
right , sorry .
here's what i suggest ...
we'll take a hostage !
what do you think?
hi , stone .
why bother?
we're the first men , i tell you .
i'm on a dig .
what?
just practising ...
you know my wife?
beautiful , isn't she?
healologist , bless this hunt .
sorry , that's gibberish .
it's a new language i made up .
didn't the old one work?
boring ...
my the hnt be gd nd my nbdy die .
what's with the accent?
it's my new language .
the accent tends to linger .
hunt and fish well .
may meat flow like water !
don't sit up and beg .
don't sit up and beg .
good yorkimoth .
so how do you like your women , like?
alive .
well , my ideal dream woman would be ... a girl .
be more specific .
someone like me .
meaning?
well , me .
for a woman like that , i'd do crazy things .
such as?
such as stroke her hand .
where are you going?
there may be eggs in it .
we'll say we hunted them for shampoo .
come on .
you swim like a dogmoth .
we show the chief?
no , he'll make us hunt .
let's wait the day out .
how d'you rate the chief's wife?
she scares me .
she turns me on .
leave it , honey , i'll bring the meat in later .
lf we keep hunting those , they'll be extinct .
chief !
you know my wife?
beautiful , isn't she?
anyway ...
we were hunting ...
yes , we were hunting and hunting and hunting ...
eggs ...
and as we were hunting ...
we found this for you from the dirtyhair chief .
put it down !
gently !
put it down and freeze !
l have no choice but to take a hostage .
l've kidnapped myself .
my hand proves it .
give me the recipe for shampoo by sundown ...
... or i'll execute myself .
numbskull .
you skipped hunting again today .
ln what way?
you two really underdo it .
gross .
my dad's blubbing .
give me the recipe by sundown or i'll execute myself .
he said it , he did it .
a great man .
great moron , more like .
farewell , lucy .
it's getting all dark !
knock it off !
dung !
i forget every time .
it's you !
i'll put a light on .
it's so dark in here .
it's good to see y ...
that hurts !
but it's good to see you .
can i get you anyth ...?
stopped working?
the chief's mad she didn't come to babysit .
move yourselves , excuse me .
move yourselves , excuse me .
move me , excuse yourselves .
excuse me !
watch it !
why make such a mammoth fuss over one dead woman?
all this mobbing and sobbing !
animals eat people every day .
this was no animal .
it was !
may i agree with you both?
it was an animal?
wasn't .
was !
it wasn't an animal !
it was !
look !
stop squabbling like infants .
i've never seen such infantry !
let me see it .
the dead body , i mean .
i didn't get what he meant .
did you?
lf animals attack in caves now ...
shut up about animals !
she's whole !
an animal would've eaten her .
unless he'd just had lunch !
or was anorexic .
we all have relatives who've been eaten !
a animal kills to eat !
that's wrong .
wrong?
come here , blondy .
see that bearmoth?
get up !
up , slob !
i said " wrong " because he said " a animal " .
lf an animal didn't kill her , maybe a vegetable did .
i've got it !
look !
she died of old age ... but young .
sure !
makes sense .
i'll leave you to bury the body .
no !
this woman died by the hand of man !
the hand of man?
nobody ever killed a body .
they just did .
stay .
all her orifices are sewn up .
even her toes?
toes aren't orifices .
why do we say " socket toe me "?
we don't .
and here's the bloody club that killed her .
you can touch .
it's stopped working .
a man killed another man .
and a woman , at that !
wait .
i have an idea .
let's swap places .
this is something unheard of .
i'm going to call it a " crime " .
it just came to me .
i could say " murder " , but no .
i like " crime " .
me too .
what nonsense !
i can see the point of stroking a cheek or shuffling pebbles but why bother to kill a person?
she'd have died anyway , sooner or later .
it's ridiculous !
why ridiculous?
it's new .
novelty's always ...
i can see the point of frolicking ...
we got it .
we must find out who did it .
what for?
to ask him why he did it .
that hurt .
are you sure , chief?
i'm the new chief .
i decide new stuff from now on .
but it's cruel !
you want silky hair or not , for dung's sake?
now .
what's the singular of hair?
hair .
it's too cruel .
i'm hideous !
you're gorgeous .
at least you look like him .
i can't go to the cleanhairs like this .
you'll go .
and you'll what?
seduce him , bring back the shampoo
and take care of myself .
that's right .
i've lost a son already .
enough's enough .
that shaved sheep looks like a pig .
get going , because ...
why do i do that?
who?
come on !
whoever did it , own up !
well?
i don't mind waiting .
i'm waiting !
you're a lousy waiter .
you're the worst waiter i ever saw .
give it a rest .
come on , out with it !
what's up?
i was diggologing .
the chief wants to know who did it to know why i did it .
see , i was diggologing ...
whoever says he did it ,
i'll give him ... a sandwich !
what kind of sandwich?
strawberry .
had an idea?
no .
your foot's on my hair .
we can find the crimer even if he doesn't own up .
easy !
we know she was killed by a club .
so the crimer must be a club owner .
we know she was sewn up
like my yorkimoth .
maybe a dirtyhair did it .
they can't sew , so .
sew !
a seamstress did it .
a club owning seamstress .
a club owning seamstress !
so !
we just need to find a seamstress who recently bought a club .
you two hulks !
go to the clubbery .
but it's three days 'walk !
no rush .
give yourselves three days .
three days 'walk makes six days there and back .
he didn't ask us to come back .
dear stones !
this death will change our lives forever but life must go on as before !
doe ball , anyone?
mine !
it's fine to say " mine ! " but it's better to play it , okay?
blondy , foul !
i didn't even touch it !
foul .
we'll send it back .
new doe !
skip the " blondy " .
call me stone .
go , moppet !
mine !
you're my dream girl all over .
wanna see my booty?
are you old?
stop !
it's a beauty spot .
beauty spots ... are proof of beauty .
what are you up to?
this is stone , stone ...
he's stone too , or " blondy " behind his back .
who's she?
guy .
who?
how d'you pronounce it?
sto o one .
no , more like " guy " .
more like " guy " .
no , " gay " .
whose name is it anyway?
what tribe are you from , guy?
the tribe at the end of the earth , where you fall off .
i've heard of that .
my whole tribe fell off , including me .
except me .
yeah?
well , goodbye .
c'mon !
whose serve?
goodbye?
we have to let her stay .
we can't feed her .
they all fell off the earth !
you want her to go home and slide off too?
okay , she can stay .
but he goes .
why me?
so the bald one's your chief .
no , i am !
i've had a wonderful day .
since the moment we met ,
i've felt that survival's worth surviving .
the sweet air , the birdmothsong , etc?
how did you know?
how advanced was your tribe?
very .
we were about to discover religion .
and how advanced were you?
oh , i already asked .
are we nearly there?
here we are .
you can sleep in the dead woman's cave .
lsn't there a lot better one?
okay , then .
good night .
i nearly forgot !
i love you .
i can't live without you either .
come , let's freshen up .
let's what?
let's wash your hair .
your curls aren't even natural !
sorry , i never get fresh on a first date .
it's getting all dark .
knock it off .
only 2 and 3/ 4 more days to the clubbery .
tell me ...
sorry , i keep forgetting your name .
stone .
i'm tempted to buy a small club while we're at it .
you'll pay more for a big one .
hi , mum .
hi , dad .
hi , darling .
no fruit?
yes .
want some?
sleep well?
i dreamed i had dark hair .
poor dear !
i've been sleeping so badly .
want to sleep with us tonight?
i'm too old for it .
still ...
i wouldn't mind sleeping with you when dad's dead .
pass the bisonette milk .
i left some for you but i finished it .
finished it?
thanks !
i'm treated like a stranger in this house .
we'll have to tell him the truth .
he's not ready yet .
hi blondy .
my name's stone !
want a butterflap?
it's a dried butterfly .
show me your hand .
which one?
look !
i've got baby fingers on this hand too !
you like leaves?
me too !
let's get going .
can i tell you a short poem?
the sky .
pretty !
the beginning's weak .
" the " is good .
will you give me some shampoo?
when?
get gathering , slackers !
we are .
get up !
supposing you were lying down .
you're giving her shampoo?
you're out of your mind !
you only met her yesterday .
at least get her pregnant first .
suit yourself .
guy loves me !
i'm a couple now .
all this digging must lead somewhere .
bones !
bones with skin on !
it's getting all dark !
knock it off !
dung !
dark already .
lizardslaw anyone?
trunk and pickles for me .
that one .
lovely nosh .
delicious , except for the mud ones .
chief !
another corpse has been crimed !
who?
stone .
our diggologist?
i found him .
i was alone .
nobody else saw him .
two deaths .
this is getting troublesome .
who'll be next?
you .
and then you .
and you .
that's okay .
but then it'll be me and that'll be sad .
the sitter drew a crowd .
the first one was a real letdown so the sequel won't be a hit .
go ahead , i've already seen it .
ah , healologist ...
you know my wife?
beautiful , isn't she?
well?
nasty !
not at all .
want to see where i was sitting?
look , he's been sewn up , like the sitter .
yes , indeed ...
lnteresting coincidence .
it's like that old crime two days ago .
he only stitched one nostril .
it must be his half brother .
maybe he was disturbed by that moron of a watcher .
nothing personal .
lf it's the same crimer , then ...
bump ...
hurt ...
horror ...
stopping ...
criming ...
sewing ...
people ...
the horror ...
horror has a face .
that's enough of that !
you two !
find the crimer !
stop there !
why us two?
i'm too cowardly right now .
bald and cowardly at once .
do we need miss judgmental?
it's okay , i'll see to the crimer .
of course .
find him and i'll let you off hunting .
i'll let you off for life .
i'll let you off for life , plus a few days .
it's a deal .
how do you express joy?
find me the crimer .
fast .
thought we wouldn't guess?
okay , i confess .
why did you crime them?
answer us !
that's good .
do that when you find him .
as for ...
that's enough .
watch it !
don't point !
ask your thing to shut up .
i've had a wonderful day .
thanks for the advice .
no sweat .
coming ...
can we see your dominant male?
he's over there .
hi .
can we ask you a few questions?
fire away .
can you tell us what happened?
as usual , i was saying , " it's getting all dark .
knock it off .
the diggologist didn't say ...
knock it off .
right .
so i went to check .
when i stepped inside , he was already ...
dead .
you have to say " dead " .
otherwise it makes no sense .
dead .
anything else?
yes .
i saw a man running away .
which way?
from behind .
let's pick up all the guys with behinds .
back up .
face the wall .
remember my shampoo .
don't worry , doll face , i'll give you what you want .
you're going to see some possible suspects .
hold this for me , i'm a witness .
it's getting all dark !
not yet .
what if the crimer recognizes me?
we've thought of that .
you'll see them from behind this one way rock .
who turned that guy around?
scram , you're innocent .
you know my wife?
beautiful , isn't she?
well , do you recognize him?
all these rocks look alike .
shall we move it?
no , he mustn't see me .
how about a fake beard?
beards don't suit me .
shift the one way rock .
don't scratch the ground , dear !
well?
how can i recognize their behinds?
it'll be tougher than i thought .
thanks anyway .
lf you leave the tribe , tell us .
of course .
lf you need anything , even just a drink ,
drop by my cave .
you know we won't .
too busy?
too choosy .
my duckymoth !
that woman scarifies me .
you know we hang out?
know what i'm thinking?
we used to walk on four feet , now we walk on two feet .
maybe soon we'll walk on no feet .
this one here .
this one's good ...
not bad .
excellent !
got it in beige?
ln beige?
did a seamstress buy a club recently?
going my way?
how about this one?
you recognize the watcher because he has a torch .
now we have a job , we need something to be recognized by .
you're right .
a torch !
these !
what was it i wanted to say?
yes .
let's recap .
what do we know so far?
how to make fire .
we're pretty good at inventing tools .
true , too .
dung !
she's just having fun !
about the crime ...
the victim was disembowelled .
fine .
but why take his guts?
to make guitar strings .
we're all on edge .
it's interesting .
go on .
guitar strings and ...
so a guitarist did it .
a seamstress sewed them up .
a guitarist seamstress .
not bad !
you're smart , guy .
you're amazing .
wait till you see me pee standing up .
find me the guitarist seamstress who did it .
i was kidding .
where do we find a guitarist seamstress?
the strum'n'stitch school .
hem in f sharp again .
c major .
embroidery !
f sharp .
she stays here .
yes , it could be dangerous .
lf i don't come back , you can have custody of the kids .
we have none .
more free time for you , then .
cross stitch .
semiquaver .
we're investigating the double crime with more than one victim .
don't mind us .
guitar stitching is like milk carving .
keep it natural !
try to mind us a bit .
start again .
c major .
f sharp : cross stitch .
look at her .
who?
the middle one .
so?
i don't trust her .
why not?
i dunno .
lntuition .
lnstinct .
stitch !
strum !
stitch !
it's simple enough !
lf your hem goes during a recital , what then?
who'll be sniggering then?
it's her .
now !
grab her !
and the dung hits the fan !
the branches go over it , not at the bottom .
it's getting all dark !
knock it off !
good night .
hi , how are you?
i'm pooped .
i was here .
me , here .
and me , just about here .
thanks a lot !
all night waiting !
this story sucks .
pinch her !
shitess !
are you happy with my work as watcher?
very .
and my work as witness?
very .
would you rather i continued as a watcher or a witness?
very very .
now tell us why you did it , okay?
your move .
i can't play .
i'm working .
coffee?
i'd prefer something with more bite .
i'm glad it's all over .
it's not over for everyone .
i didn't like you much at first .
as time goes by , i'm getting to loathe you .
funny you said that 'cause it's not very funny .
stone?
try miming it with words .
won't that confuse things?
try it .
the trout goes upstream step by step !
better .
now try using words that fit the topic .
why did you kill those two women?
lncluding a man !
good !
got the hang of it?
yes .
i had the hang of it before , too .
good work .
this bit wasn't right .
get some rest .
you're staying till you tell us why !
so it's been confirmed?
the killer isn't a vegetable?
keep a close eye on her .
i love your breath .
will you have it tomorrow?
the investigation's over !
to celebrate , i suggest we all go and celebrate !
a happy hippo meal for everyone !
so let's go !
i'm going .
we are gathered together ...
please !
we're all here to celebrate the end of this gruelling but short inquiry , thanks to her without whom it could never have happened ,
stone the murderette !
thanks .
it wasn't me .
still , thanks for your warm welcome .
you're all equally nice people , especially the pretty boy .
good eat !
1 7 minutes later
actually , i did the witnessing on your latest crime .
what makes a good witness?
three things .
look , see , see .
look seeing you now , i see your front and back are different shapes .
1 1 minutes later
we forgot to invite the healologist .
join us and consider yourself invited two hours ago .
what are you feasting?
wrong !
what are you eating .
we've found the culprit .
let me introduce her .
you'll pay for this !
no , it's my treat .
was he like that before?
no , he wasn't not like that .
what happened to his stuffed thing?
nobody knows how it died .
night watcher or witness?
given the choice ...
7 minutes later
... friends and family .
my daughter , who's also my best friend ... 4 minutes later
yes !
greedyguts !
doesn't the chief suspect anything?
can i sleep at your place tonight?
what for?
i feel sleepy .
the trouble is ...
no time later
there's only one bed .
no problem .
i'll sleep between your wife and you .
lf i don't mind , i don't see why not .
which hand?
wait !
let me check .
why've you got a chicken bone there?
why's that chicken bone there?
it's to twiddle your hair !
i don't think so .
how pathetic !
he twiddles his hair !
he's not naturally curly !
hey , curly !
you rotten dirtyhair !
that's right !
dirtyhair !
put that in your pipe !
i knew all along why your hair smells of poo but i kept quiet 'cause i thought you were different and that under your dirt , you deserved to be ... clean .
but you're like all of your tribe .
dirty dirty !
wait !
stop running after me !
guy's a dirtyhair .
i knew it !
why didn't you say , treasure?
i knew when you said " guy's a dirtyhair .
chief !
a call for you !
who is it?
lt's me , the murderizer /
record every fuckin 'word of this .
l'm the real crimer / you caught the wrong culprit /
am i free?
can i go now?
l'm the only killer /
keep him talking till we track him .
are you pro abortion?
l dunno .
how about you?
that's a tough one .
lf the woman's pregnant , i'm pro ...
bye .
but if she's not , there's no point ,
i reckon !
then again ...
sorry to interrupt .
go ahead .
lt's just to say i'm killing tomorrow .
give him to me .
who are you killing?
it's a surprise .
where will you do it?
tricky question .
let's say i'll do it here , where i am now .
not fair !
get him to come here .
he's one and we're a lot .
what?
take it from me !
let me talk to him .
okay , i'll tell him .
well then?
okay !
wherever you say .
can't you ever say no?
one last thing .
i'll dump my victim in a watery hollow /
hollow?
hullo?
hello?
pardon me .
you got the whole conversation?
let's hear it again .
lt's just to say i'm killing tomorrow /
rewind .
you know we hang out?
too far .
i'm the murderizer / there .
again .
l'm the murderizer /
play it again slowly .
listen to the background noise !
sounds of water !
a watery hollow . " that explains it !
croaking !
toadmoths !
toadmoths live ...
ln bogs !
tomorrow we stake out the bog .
not too early .
you two !
to witness the crime , we'll ...
okay , so you're the witnesses .
i'm being left out of it .
it makes me ...
you use people and dump them like old ... leaves !
that's no way to treat people !
we're a tribe !
you're a tribe !
you're a tribe !
i'm a tribe !
one last thing .
take it or leave it , it's up to you .
it's getting all dark .
as i was saying , we'll need to wear camouflage .
what's wrong?
your camouflage !
i'm a frog .
there's no such thing as a six foot frogmoth .
only because i'm standing up .
look .
keep it down !
i'm not really a chick .
i'm the chief .
you know my wife?
she's not here .
why not?
too risky .
the kids are minding her .
right !
there's a 9/ 10 chance he'll come from there , 9/ 10 he'll come from there , and 9/ 10 from there .
that makes a 27/ 30 chance he'll come ... from there .
so we're ideally placed .
knock it off .
aren't you going to the bog?
the chief asked me to but i'm not in the mood .
you can't witness everything .
you must be upset , though .
lsn't it getting all dark yet?
i'd be upset if i were you .
pity your wife's not here .
i could have pok ...
what's dungface doing here?
you called my daughter a dirty dirty !
nobody does that !
nobody calls my girl a dirty dirty .
proud of yourself?
stigmatizing people for their looks?
hooray for racial supremacy !
fine role models you are !
sophisticates !
let's be reasonable .
you be quietable !
yes , we have dirty hair but we give lice a home .
you think you're so great with your tresses and gloss !
you're disgusting .
you know what?
keep your shampoo .
i'm going back to scratch my head with pride .
bye !
where's the crimer got to?
he's letting us down .
what's the matter?
i'm wandering aimlessly .
because of guy?
good riddance to bad rubbish .
i know , but ...
i cherished the hope of adopting her .
i'm against adoption .
you're a fine one to talk .
what do you mean?
what do you mean?
there !
but if you like this one , let's talk .
excellent choice .
made in france , sturdy , it's as good as they come .
