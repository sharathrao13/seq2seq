my number is 3752 4460 .
i hope you`il return my call .
yes?
who are you?
i'm komiyama .

i disguised myself , by wearing clothes i'd never choose .

yes .
why on earth?
i just had lunch with my husband .
and?
at a french restaurant called " l " .
may l?
yes ...
i left while he was settling the bill .
of course no one saw me .
i was wearing these .
you look like a kid .
my husband will fall for it .
aren't we bossy .
here .
what `s that?
a million .
that`il cover it right?
the kidnapping .
thanks .
don't worry .
i washed it .
oh , thanks .
what is it?
it's just that um ...
i hadn't noticed yesterday , but haven't we met before?
no , i don't think so .
i see ...
i certainly don't dress this way .
right .
sorry .
not at all .
i figured out a place to hide while i'm kidnapped .
what?
my college friend , soma rumi , happens to be in america now .
she asked me to feed her tropical fish , so i have her keys .
you think of everything .
that bother you?
no .
does your husband know?
i didn't tell him .
when does she return?
next monday .
i see .
what do you say?
you're serious .
i told you i was .
yes .
sorry .
and once you're free .
what?
when you're kidnapped , your husband will call the police .
if not at first , then definitely after you get home .
we need a dose of reality to make it convincing .
reality?
yes .
besides , i don't want to get caught by the cops either .
which apartment?
303 .
you go ahead .
make sure no one sees you go in .
and you , handyman?
i got stuff to do .
ok .
l`il make the first call now .
yes .
let's go over a few details .
yes .
komiyama saori was abducted near " l " and confined somewhere .
always remember that premise .
yes .
that where , is of course not here .
meaning you leave no evidence of having been here .
yes .
first , don't go touching anything .
yes .
second , keep the curtains shut , like this .
yes .
when you need a light , use this .
yes .
and obviously , don't answer the phone or the door .
of course you stay inside .
keep it locked up .
yes .
and no feeding those fish either .
what?
listen .
you've been kidnapped .
how can you feed the fish?
but they'll die , then .
who matters more , you or the fish?
i understand .
next , the hostage life , 101 .
101?
first , no baths .
or showers .
no showers?
of course not .
not even my face?
listen , lady .
if you want the story to fly , you need actions , not just words .
i`m sorry .
also , only eat the food i brought .
don't touch any of her food .
i understand .
it'll be rough , but that's the deal .
yes .
and there's one more thing .
while you were being held , your hands and feet were tied .
yes .
you have to tie me?
it'll be more realistic if your hands and feet are bruised .
put on the others .
yes .
i'm ready .
i'll get rid of these clothes .
all right?
yes .
i'll tie you up now .
you've got to bear it .
yes .
you see how i did it?
i guess .
undo it to go to the bathroom , but tie yourself back up again .
i understand .
your wrists , too .
it doesn't have to be so tight .
you want to be able to untie it .
yes .
try it .
pull this through here .
and tie it like this .
yes .
pull it with your teeth .
what are you doing?
you're defenseless , aren't you , lady?
what?
i always wanted to fuck someone tied up .
we're not playing anymore .
get it?
please ... don't ...
this is shinko enterprises .
hello .
this is sato from meiwa bank .
we always appreciate your business .
is the president in?
please hold .
now this is what you call reality , lady .
i'll call when i get back .
but i can't answer the phone .
i'll ring 3 times , hang up , then 3 times again .
you unlock the door .
i'll call when i'm close .
three rings , and then another three rings .
lady .
a mistake to answer the phone .
who is this?
who cares .
you?
you did this?
it's your fault , mr. kidnapper .
why'd you do it?
it just happened .
that's no reason .
look who's talking .
you snatched her liberty .
no .
she asked me to stage a kidnapping .
that's all .
you tied her up to stage a kidnapping?
it's the truth .
she asked me to kidnap her .
huh .
i wonder if the cops will buy that .
i need a favor .
what?
dump her for me .
what?
i don't like loose ends .
do it yourself .
don't want to get caught .
enough of your crap .
forget it .
oh , well .
then i have no choice .
meaning?
i'll call the cops right now .
tell them i heard a woman screaming in 303 .
what's wrong?
ok .
i'll do it .
thanks .
what?
take care of it .
noboru .
daddy .
what's wrong?
what happened?
had a fight?
ok .
c'mon inside .
this is ebara ail serve .
i can't take your call right now .
please leave your name and number after the tone and i'll call you back .
hello , it's misako ...
hi , it's me .
what , you're home .
say , is noboru with you?
yeah he is .
why can't you call !
what?
i didn't know where he'd gone , and was about to call the police .
sorry .
why are you always like this?
can't you think about others?
noboru came by himself .
but you could still call !
sorry .
i'll come get him .
no , i'll bring him .
leave now .
ok .
wait here , noboru .
where you going?
where you going` !
