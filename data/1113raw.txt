want me to tell you something?
millions of celestial bodies are hurtling toward earth as we speak .
meteors and asteroids .
heading for earth .
straight toward us .
and they're dangerous .
most of them burn up on their way through the atmosphere .
but meteorites don't burn up .
on the surface , everything might seem fine .
then it happens .
out of the blue .
if a meteorite the size of a house strikes us ...
all life will be extinguished .
birger larsen?
it's happened before , and not very long ago .
just think of the dinosaurs .
bang !
game over .
we said 20, 000 , right?
sure they're legal?
of course .
these are the world's greatest fireworks .
they're about to send up a satellite that will spot dangerous meteorites .
if one's about to hit us , they can fire a nuclear missile .
that will divert the meteorite .
and it will crash somewhere else .
like mars .
we can't save all the planets .
a couple , maybe .
like earth .
december 22
hi , juni .
this christmas will be a lot better than last year's .
there'll be less wind .
there were less butterflies this year ,
which means chances of a hurricane are minimal .
that's been scientifically proven .
well , not quite proven , but almost .
johannes said everyone's going home for christmas .
and he knows what he's talking about .
i can't do it .
i can't stop thinking about work .
aren't you a little early?
what do you know?
you can have my room .
won't you be back after christmas?
we're going to have so much fun , with christmas carols and nuts .
and dad has bought me an expensive gift .
a car .
used?
yes .
because they love me more than the heavens and the earth .
they'll be here soon .
cab driver?
this is only temporary .
i'm attending the police academy .
not bad , huh?
to become a cop?
don't you think?
whatever .
do you have family up there at ...?
sollihogda .
a daughter .
it's important to show you care .
hey !

they want to deport me !
get out of here !
i want my money back !
you'll have it tomorrow .
i'll take care of it .
let me borrow your scarf .
juni's going to hang herself again .
no , she isn't .
you're going home to sing christmas carols .
silent night , " that's a classic .
and that one about the tree ...
give it to me .
no , juni .
yes .
they're serving headcheese , tea and coffee .
faggot !
you're going to get a new used car .
you'll just stretch it .
you'll ruin my scarf .
forget it .
use something else .
my fault .
my fault .
that didn't hurt at all .
no one touches juni !
keep a minimum distance of 85 cm .
85 cm .
i'll remember that .
preferably a full meter .
maybe more .
then you'd be sure .
tromso doctor thaws dead people .
crazy .
crazy .
medical science's latest discovery : .
it's healthy to be happy .
faggot .
a drunk farmer killed an ostrich ...
crazy .
let him finish .
faggot !
i'm not gay , i'm a manic depressive .
you're a crazy faggot .
we are a gathering of rich people ... ... with an alternative interpretation of reality .
who are going home for christmas .
we just want you to be happy .

juni , you know what they're about to get?
who?
the scientists .
the entire blueprint .
humans , genes , all that .

that they can put us together so everything is right .
is that far off?
no , i think it's right around the corner .
want me to comfort you?
you know i don't let anyone touch me .
juni?
never mind .
it was just this other science project ...
we need all the light we can get .
hi .

merry christmas .
hi , juni .
hi .
merry christmas .
you too .
i just want to check that i have everything .
let's sit down .
no , i'm ready to go .
remember last year?
how painful it was for everyone that you weren't happy?
odd?
your hair looks nice .
i'm practically cured .
thought i'd apply to the university next spring .
physics or biochemistry .
we thought this year ...
we're going away .
where to?
the canary islands .
great .
i could use some sun .
don't ...
i'm doing much better this year than the past two years .
don't make this any harder .
this is for you .
from us .
it can be exchanged , if ...
are you going to screw?
we'll send you a postcard , juni .
merry christmas .
i'll talk to her , reidar .
crazy?
no .
you're just sad .
but tomorrow ... ... everything will be much better .
i'm heading home now .
the usual time?
we'll keep an eye on juni .
thanks .
she's in her room .
if you see her with a scarf ...
give your mother my best .
bye .
mrs. ruud , you promised we'd discuss the nursing home .
you can't stay here alone .
but i'm fine .
yes , you look good today .
you don't .
they'll take good care of you .
take care?
of me?
i don't understand .
i don't need taking care of .
fine .
i'll be back tomorrow .
no , you won't .
hi , reidar .
hi .
don't worry .
we'll work something out for your mother .
talk to you later .

radio .
christmas present .
coffee pot .
mom?
potted plant .
are you all right?
do you think i can't take care of myself?
that's what they think .
i'm going to bring charges against them .
i take care of ...
otto?
everything .
i take care of you , reidar .
you aren't going to the home?
reidar , you're the one who's in a home !
i know .
that's my fault .
right .
we'll work something out .
no problem .
no problem .
you weren't really hungry , were you?
i just have to keep moving .
mom?
we'll work something out .
one step at a time .
horse number 4 is in the lead ...
come on !
200, 000 !
... but number 11 slips by to win by a nose !
no !
shit !
1 . 6 million goes to four lucky winners who picked number 11 .
hi .
hi .
i'm glad my dick isn't limp .
what happened to your husband?
did it happen suddenly , or over time?
stop it .
500 kroner?
i guess that's money , too .
look .
a letter from the police academy .
were you accepted?
of course .
you haven't even opened it .
i'm saving it for christmas eve .
that's not funny .
hi .
is this awkward for you?
not at all .
remember this?
christmas ... 1988 .
maybe we should move .
to a house .
a house in the country .
with cows .
and maybe a little dog .
nah .
easy .
there you go , otto .
otto?
wow !
a naked chinaman .
no , otto !
come on , baby .
did you get a little scratch?
let's go home .
one foot in front of the other .
there you go !
we just keep on moving .
hi .
can't you sleep , either?
it isn't your fault .
1001 ... 1002 ...
it won't strike here .
1001 ... 1002 ...
it's only 500 meters away .
reidar?
do you think we have to stay here till we die?
i assume so .
i don't know if i can stay that long .
are you ok?
yes .
good night .
good night .
december 23
will you be late this evening?
no .
it's ok with me .
you know that .
it's ruined .
someone smashed alf's flowers .
what were they?
tulips?
daisies?
what were they going to be?
na ...
na ...
nadia .
we can fix this .
and you had spent so much time on these .
made little plastic tents ...
it was juni !
no way .
wow !
did you see that beautiful white bird?
it wasn't her fault .
it was mine !
stand over there .
do you have a referral?
the hospital refused to take him .
no , no ...
juni !
he wants to sleep with me .
no , i don't think he does .
he says he doesn't like girls .
juni !
johannes , he's gay !
he says he's a homosexual .
crazy?
no .
just afraid .
bring him to the hospital .
they won't take him .
usually in situations like this ...
does he have family?
if not , it's up to his doctor .
that would be me .
he should be deported .
we can't even understand him .
he spoke norwegian yesterday .
shock is a good diagnosis .
and if he really is ill?
then he has to stay , right?
it is christmas , after all .
yes .
it is christmas .
i'll be back in a minute .
she didn't mean anything by it .
she was just afraid .
sorry .
my fault .
one day this ball will go through the wall .
then everything will be in harmony .
and there will be nothing to be afraid of .
a huge meteor could crash right through here .
and nothing would happen .
no one would get hurt .
it's not very likely , but ... you can always hope .
maybe i should go in to her?
really?
i agree .
it was my fault .
i shouldn't have left you yesterday .
it's so hard to get rid of yourself .
maybe you should wait .
it's better during the summer .
more practical .
summer's so far off .
no .
would you help me?
please?
there's nothing to be afraid of .
want me to comfort you?
i don't need to touch you .
just comfort you with ...
with words .
horses grazing at night ...
we have to do something , mrs. ruud .
he's fine .
he just needs something to drink .
let me call the nursing home .
then you won't have any worries .
will they take otto?
your bed is waiting .
the nurses are looking forward to your arrival .
nurses?
is reidar in on this?
i have spoken with him .
i see .
i'll be back tomorrow , and we can pack .
bye .
here's your medicine .
he needs help .
no doubt about that .
thank you .
psychotic?
paranoid?
borderline?
manic depressive?
i think you should be manic depressive .
just make your face expressionless .
that's it .
if he's too normal , they'll send him back to burma .
manic depressive .
i'll be back soon .
are you ok?
sit on each side , and make sure that juni doesn't get by you .
no problem .
not while i'm here .
faggot .
no , i'm not .
bye .
it's me .
you've been plotting against me .
you should be ashamed of yourself !
against your own mother?
i don't want to hear it !
not another word !
i often need to have things spelled out .
could you please do that now?
it's your christmas present .
that's two days off .
what?
christmas .
i don't have time to wait .
best to get it over with .
i'm sorry .
oh , is it you?
bye now !
what do you think his name is?
birger?
his name isn't birger , you idiot !
birger ...
birger?
birger?
his name isn't birger !
birger .
birger .
you said it was legal to sell fireworks from a gas station !
i want my money back !
that was my life savings .
i'll get it to you tomorrow .
i need that money now .
i have it .
then why don't i have it?
you'll get it .
consider it a long term investment .
hi .
going far?
yes .
lucky it's my turn .
going to a party?
i'm going to the canary islands .
my name's thomas .
are you all right?
nice house .
kind of art deco , isn't it?
please don't touch anything .
worried someone might come home?
they won't be home until christmas eve .
who?
mom and dad .
i was worried you were married .
mom's side .
dad's side .
ok ...
do you need help?
aren't you going to take your clothes off?
you have to .
i'll just drop them on the floor .
it'll be over soon .
no one needs to know .
say that .
say it !
say , " we don't have to tell anyone .
this is too weird .
was your name juni?
shit !
is everything ok?
juni?
juni .
i got a new dress .
because they love me more than the heavens and the earth .
but ...
juni ...
juni?
juni !
juni?
she was totally insane .
i just followed her inside to get paid .
and she whacked me with a lamp .
you hadn't done anything?
not a thing !
and look at me now !
so what?
i can't do this today .
are you spying on someone?
is that what you're up to?
no .
how's your dog?
fine .
do you have a problem?
no .
maybe you have a serious problem .
i'll spare you the entire story .
thank you .
is this your car?
are you drunk?
my dear mrs. ruud ...
so , you know who i am .
and i know who you are .
a nurse .
psychiatrist .
same difference .
now i know how you get us committed .
you spy on us !
give me your keys , before i call the police !
get him , otto !
get him !
damn peeping tom .
get him , otto !
careful .
johannes ...
i'll go with her to the hospital .
they're all after me !
everyone?
hear that?
did you call for that ambulance?
christmas eve
merry christmas .
merry christmas .
merry christmas .
merry christmas .
he's gay .
hi .
did you have a nice ambulance ride?
good food?
what did you get?
rice porridge .
so did we .
with juice?
were they angry?
no .
well , maybe the guy who had to clean up ...
reidar?
if i really want to ...
if it's what i really want ...
don't you want to wait?
will you help me?
please?
can't you just wait?
please .
smart doggy .
good doggy .
she thought we wanted to go to some nursing home .
but we don't want that , do we?
she thought she was so smart .
mrs. ruud?
that won't help .
it doesn't help to have an education .
mrs. ruud?
you rest here , and i'll get us some food .
no one will find us in here , otto .
crazy?
i may not be perfect ,
but i know the difference between a manic depressive and ...
sorry , my fault .
hi .
hi .
reidar's mom , mrs. ruud , is missing .
is she here?
no .
you didn't come home last night .
i tried calling .
will you be home soon?
no .
you can't run this hospital on your own .
no .
it's christmas eve .
yes .
but i have to stay in case something happens to juni .
how is she?
she's ... fine , i guess .
johannes ...
something bad happened .
something bad?
she had sex with a stranger .
you think you can handle it , but you can't .
do you think it will work out?
no .
if i said that ... ... that nothing ever happened .
maybe we could put it behind us?
no , we've ...
it's gone too far .
this is what you wanted , wasn't it?
you should have stopped me , johannes .
i love you .
it doesn't happen often .
but we can always hope .
you just have to be in the right place at the right time .
when everything is just right .
when the quarks in the ball match the quarks in the wall ,
the quarks in the ball will sneak past the quarks in the wall .
without colliding .
there will be a moment of harmony , when everything is in balance .
you just have to be there at the right moment .
it might be right now .
kierkegaard .
have you read any kierkegaard?
i used to read him .
obsessive behavior is not unusual .
some people just get more out of it than others .
you'll find a solution .
but i can't stay here any longer .
i didn't realize how difficult it was to be insane .
too bad .
there's just something missing in your eyes .
it's good you have an umbrella .
mom ...
she thinks of everything .
merry ...
christmas .
i want my money back , thank you .
you're welcome !
hey !
i know .
the rent .
you'll get it tomorrow .
pedigree !
that's it , otto .
it may not look like it , but this is my money .
i don't trust the bank , and i had forgotten my key .
it's mine .
i know who you are .
please .
i know where you live .
please , don't ...
could you help me?
i need some dog food .
do you know where i live?
automatic .
nice .
good to have .
you can't do it here .
this place is full of doctors .
you aren't trying to stop me again?
no .
are you sure?
yes .
don't you dare try !
hi .
out for a walk?
typical .
going to your sister's?
i've always wanted to go somewhere .
see other cultures .
a place like london .
penny lane and those other streets .
stop !
no , please .
those two people are nuts .
hi .
recognize me?
we'd be happy to drive you home .
juni !
hello?
juni?
you're freezing to death .
come with me .
come on , we can drive you .
sorry .
my fault .
i should have told you she's a hitter .
it's pathological .
ask her where she's going .
where are you going?
home .
fine .
we'll drive you home .
is everyone ok?
want me to tell you something?
millions of celestial bodies are hurtling towards earth .
straight toward us .
they're dangerous .
some of them don't burn up in the atmosphere .
some make it through , and strike us .
it's happened before .
those meteors don't care if it's christmas eve .
they'll just make it worse for you .
i'll have to shut down .
i only have fire insurance , not burglary insurance .
do you have a light?
they're about to send up a satellite that can spot incoming meteors .
if they spot one , they can fire a nuclear missile .
that will divert the meteorite .
everyone lives somewhere .
then it will crash somewhere else .
like mars .
we can't save all the planets .
maybe none .
i hope they send up that satellite soon .
we may run out of time .
watch out !
ok?
come on out .
careful .
watch out , reidar .
mom?
otto?
i can't feel my legs !
where are you , otto?
look .
that means someone just died .
no , it means you can make a wish .
he needs help .
come on .
juni .
juni ...
i've seen it on tv .
this is how they do it .
then they are reborn .
i just wish someone had understood his final words .
maybe he said something to his parents .
i understood some of it .
really?
he was talking fast , and in a foreign language , but ...
what did he say?
he said you shouldn't take those pills .
really?
and that everything would be better now .
things are going to get much better .
really?
we should set him on fire .
maybe that's not necessary .
no .
i think maybe i'm a little cold .
juni?
may i touch you?
i'm a hitter .
that's all right .
ok .
no problem .
i'm all right .
is this where you've been hiding?
let's sit here and rest for a while , otto .
life lasts but a brief second
one filled with both good and bad
i have fire insurance .
these are the world's greatest fireworks !
are you ok?
life lasts but a brief second
one filled with both good and bad
if you believe or hope you will be disappointed
life's hands keep turning you meet and break apart
first a light and happy game
then you part and go your opposite ways
i have left you now
although i still love you
that's why i tell you
you may forget , but i remember every word
everything broke , but no trace was left behind
at least i have the memories
they can never take them away from me
remember the joys we found together?
remember the thoughts which bound us together?
every day , every hour i have counted
if you forget , i will remember it all
nick norris
