he went for my ears
the insurance is bound to pay up
what sort of gear is it?
shoes

i'm sorry
i'm really sorry
i hope i didn't hurt your feelings

if i say i picked up a hitchhiker i'll lose my job
we're not allowed to take hitchhikers
what a pain
well ... here goes
did you report it?
did it work out?
i don't know what to do
i just don't know
make your phone call and i'll take you to the station , okay?
it's the best i can do
but if i tell the truth
i'll get fired for sure
and i'm not sure the insurance will cover the gear
i don't like to make a false report ... but the car has to be broken into
it's the only way
i'm going to tell the truth
i'll risk it
this is paco cazale .
is mr. letour there?
not at the moment
he's out at a meeting .
can i take a message?
no , i have to talk to him .
somebody stole my car

i'll phone him again later
he's going to call the office in an hour or two
is there a number where i can reach you?
yes , hold on
excuse me
can he phone me here at your place in an hour or two?
i have no choice
the number?
it's on the phone
i'm causing you a lot of trouble
you weren't to know
in the meantime i'll make that police report
the car may never be found so i may as well say it was parked in a street
so your vehicle was parked on rue davot
where in the street?
near number 22
and there was some gear in it
and ... my luggage
but it was ... properly parked !
here in le guilvinec
of course i locked it .
of course i locked it !
no , please ...
just a minute , mr. letour
i wanted ... one more thing
i'm allowed to stretch my legs !
but ... of course the shoes were in it !
that's what i don't know !
i have no idea
you tell me !
okay , i get it
okay , no problem !
no problem , yeah ...
fuck you !
i guess i'm out of a job
it wasn't me !
he'll be okay
don't worry , he'll be up and about in a week
he'll be fine
so you mean ... there's no problem?
it's just that ...
i left in a hurry this morning
i didn't want to go away without thanking you
i wanted to say ...
i wanted to say ...
yes?
you wanted to say what?
nothing special .
just ... to thank you , i thought maybe ...
i could take you out to dinner but maybe it's not ...
that's really kind .
roland?
fancy dinner tonight?
yeah , great !
oh no , i can't tonight .
i'll grab a few cds and get going
you were saying about your wife ...
my wife and i are in the process of separating ... maybe
we decided to give each other a month of total freedom without any contact , for any reason
one month?
we meet again in three weeks to decide if we should go back and live together ... carry on as a couple ... or go our separate ways
it's a way of ... testing the feelings we have ... for each other
obviously i can't go home
obviously not , under the circumstances
what's your name?
marinette
i'm paco
paco cazale .
i heard you on the phone
you're spanish?
no , catalan
and your wife?
she's catalan too
no , i mean ... her first name .
it's important .
your name can change your life
is roland ...?
you mean ...
roland's my brother
why?
just wondering
he could have been ...
my husband
is marriage important to you?
no , no ...
i mean yes
i have a small question to ask you
do you actually prefer crayfish or crepes?
crepes
it figures
it's pretty here
very pretty
i must be out of my mind !
i don't know you ...
mind the water
that's my car !
what will you do?
i don't know
i have to find out if the little thief locked the car
like i told the police
and then you'll go?
i don't know
you can stay tonight too , if you like
i hit you a bit hard
it's understandable .
you were very angry
thanks , anyway
what for?
the police didn't come
i'll tell you where your car is
okay .
by the way ...
did you happen to lend it to someone?
who would i lend it to?
and you locked it?
you know , i don't own much , so ...
i'm not in the habit
the keys are in my pocket
so i've got the keys
that's something
you know , stealing cars is not in my philosophy
something got into me when i saw all those shoes
a crazy urge to drive off in the car
i don't know ...
i didn't go far
you found me here
don't worry
you won't get into trouble and you'll soon be out
you're a good sport
if i'd known ...
listen , i'll tell you the truth
i borrowed your car to seduce a woman
to seduce a woman?
as i don't have much luck with women
i wanted to seduce them by pretending
i have a job , nice car , the works
i even took it to the car wash so it's not like i damaged it
you know , give a woman a nice pair of shoes always makes her happy !
i managed to stay the night with her but it didn't work out
i slept at her place , yeah , but on the couch
early next morning she asked me to ... get out
that's funny
why?
because ...
i also spent that night with a woman , also on the couch
in fact , i met her thanks to you
are you in love?
i think so
so?
what?
nothing
like that?
like that ... or like this
i got you a glass
what will you say if you see your wife?
do you want to live with her again?
actually , i'm not married
i lied to you a little
why?
because it was ... too complicated
the truth is i split up with my girlfriend and there's no way i'm going back to her
why did you make up that story?
i didn't think about it
i thought if i was married i'd have more chance that you would believe me and trust me , in the middle ... of all that hassle
i wanted so much ... to stay with you
i wanted it ... really sincerely
sometimes you can tell the truth more easily with lies
all right?
i have something to tell you
something difficult ... and delicate ... so i preferred to write it down
can i read it now?
paco , the day we met you touched me , made me laugh and surprised me
something strong happened
i fell in love with you before i knew it
i don't want to be hurt .
i fell in love suddenly once before and he was unfaithful .
our relationship was doomed
i'm afraid it'll happen again with you
everything's moving too fast
i have a suggestion .
i'll tell you the truth without lies
i'd rather you left , paco .
make your lie come true
we give ourselves three weeks of freedom no contact whatsoever
then , if you want , we'll meet again
have affairs , if you must , before we live togetherif we do
i'm not a onenight woman .
i need time
three weeks apart with no contact , whatever happens
then we'll know if we really want to meet again
this marinette you see again in three weeks?
it's all i think about
till then , you got nothing special to do?
how about we hit the road together?
if you want , of course hit the road?
me , i'm on the road .
it's not always easy , but ... if you want , we can hit the road together
all right?
mister?
can i open the window?
go ahead
what's that little ... fir tree?
you know?
i see thing like that ... everywhere these days
it's a " magic tree " .
for the smell
smells good , eh?
i'll let you out here .
i turn right
can't we stop here?
what you want in this hole?
there's nothing
we can sleep here and go on tomorrow
no , to sleep ... we need to get to pont l'abbe .
is okay there
there's a hotel here
it's not for me
come on , it's a crummy hotel
look , i ...
i can't afford it
don't worry .
it's on me
listen , for me is ... homeless shelters ... dodges ...
once or twice a month , a year ...
what you call it?
youth hostel
i can't afford it
i told you , it's on me .
i'll pay
it won't cost much anyway
don't worry .
we get to pont l'abbe
i'll swing it .
i'm used to it
i'm not waiting here for hours to get some ... weirdo
we stink to hell , nino !
i want a wash
ten more minutes !
no !
i'm staying here .
you do what you want
so?
how does it feel?
how does it feel to be on the road?
to be here?
i feel like a chump who had his car pinched ... and his job
can i take a cigarette?
eat , before it gets cold
most of all i feel like ... a guy who has a chick on his brain and doesn't know what to do
i'm not going to sponge on you .
i can take care of myself
i know
in any case ...
listen , i'm going for a leak and then i'm going to bed
you order two coffees?
that was very good
we'll have two shots and two coffees , please
can i use the phone?
only local calls
too bad .
i wanted international
you have an accent .
what is it?
i'm russian
funny things , phones .
different in every country
in ltaly they're very small
in other countries big
small ... how do you say?
i forget every time
small dial , big dial , small receiver , big receiver
what's your first name?
i got a date with her later
you do?
here's to your date
stop , thanks
isn't your friend coming down?
he's ... tired
he's not too good on long distances
i thought you'd both be here .

guenaelle is a pretty first name

funny ...
but it's not russian
yes , it's ...
it's not russ ...
yes , it's ltalian
i'm russian but originally from ltaly
i think ... l'm going to quit , nino
i don't know why i'm here
my head's full of marinette
and where are we going?
i don't even know
i thought you knew
i don't .
where are we going?
towards nantes okay , but where?
we don't need to go any special place
all right?
yeah , all right
this short cut is nice , isn't it?
hold it .
i just had a thought
the sun ... rises in the east , right?
yeah , the sun's there
so we're heading west
don't you ever want to settle down somewhere?
yeah , but where?
why are you on the road?
i like it .
it's in my philosophy
done it for long?
quite a while
leaving aside your philosophy , really ... why do you do it?
are you from the police?
i came from russia two years ago
i came to france to marry a french girl .
we met out there
one week before the wedding , she disappeared like smoke
so i lost the taste for stability
you have any questions , ask them .
i'm not gonna spend days and nights talking about it
did you never see her again?
never
never , never , never .
i tried everything
she vanished ... like that
maybe she thought she took a wrong turn and wanted the little russian out of her life
why didn't you go back home to russia?
because i looked too stupid
i left like a king
imagine all my family , my friends ...
good luck nino !
i was ashamed
i never think of going back to face my folks
maybe one day , if i have the guts
we're not getting far today
no , we're not getting very far
we're not getting very far
i had an idea .
you interested in that waitress last night?
waitress?
why?
she asked us to dinner tonight
we'd have a place to sleep and i was thinking ...
i'm not interested in her but you stand a chance , you really do
she said she'd invite another girlfriend so maybe we could turn around and go back as we're not getting very far
i bet you can't walk on your head
walk on your head
what do you mean?
watch
watch go on
see?
i can walk on my head
that's not your head , it's your hands
no , it's my head .
watch

you've landed on an expert
let's go .

you ever went to russia?
no , but maybe i'll get the chance one day
it's a big , big country i thought ...
you thought compared to spain , russia ...
paella , of course ...
no , spain is very near to france
i've never been there
it's easy to go to spain .
russia is 1, 000 miles
but i did ...
right , it's not exactly close ...
i did actually ...
when i went ...
i have a friend who went to galicia
ah , galicia it's wild
they have mussels in galicia as well

zippos never go out , is that it?
like i said , now i appreciate french wine
we haven't clinked glasses
where i come from , we drink to get smashed

do what you want but don't tell me lies
we fooled around , that's all
i know what i'm saying
there are two rubbers short
two rubbers short

i don't poke in your things .
i picked it up
you left it lying around .
i found it and saw two were gone
two rubbers !
two rubbers ...

guenaelle's cousin is getting married this weekend out near ploneour ...
ploneour lanvern , you know?

down the hatch
down it !
i'm not thirsty
do it .
do it !
fucking do it !
don't shout at her
why you girls all around the world the same?
why?
tell me !
say something !
you not capable of any deep feelings?
i tell you .
deep feelings ... deep feelings to you are like greek
and then you have the gall to complain that you're not understood !
you're only interested in goodlooking guys
you don't know how to look at a man
simply a man
feel and see what is inside him ... simply inside him
you know why?
you want i tell you why?
because you only interested in appearance !
fucking goddamn shit !
simply ...
sorry , paco .
i spoiled your evening
you're my pal , i spoiled your evening but not on purpose
there's a good example
a lady .
simply ... simply sitting
look how she's sitting .
simply
there's no strength , no fucking strength
sorry i say " fucking " and " goddamn shit " but me being a foreigner , i learn here in france several words : " fucking " , " goddamn shit " , " go to hell
sorry , lady .
you have beautiful eyes
and that's the truth
can't we stop?
if we're hitching there's no point walking
you see that town?
i see it
i'm sure , in that town , there has to be a woman for you
a woman who loves you but doesn't know it yet
i'm even sure ... that in every single town in france there's at least one woman who'd love you if she knew you
i mean at least one !
one is the minimum
so in all the towns in france ...
think about it .
add them all up
it's crazy .
the potential is enormous !
the only problem with that town is how to meet her
she's there so we cross the river !
but to meet her , to meet her ... we have to locate her so that you can meet
and you will .
you know what we'll do?
i have an idea
we'll do an opinion poll
opinion poll?
we'll make up a questionnaire and pretend we're doing a poll about women .
for a newspaper , for instance
so we can question women without making them suspicious
now , important ...
the subject of the poll .
we'll tell them it's a poll about the ideal man
that way , we'll know right away which woman suits you the best ... appeals to you the most ... ... and is almost sure to like you
that's how we locate her
that's it
but wait .
are you sure this ... poll is reliable?
reliable , yes ... if we ask the right questions ... and find the single women
you list the girls 'names up to " p " , i'll do the rest
get the addresses , too
i have an idea for a question .
how about this?
do you want ... for a woman to like philosophy in men?
no , that's not it
if she likes men ... who like philosophy?
that's it
i thought about another one
does your ideal man necessarily have to be french?
that's damn good
do you like russians?
no , we can't ask if they like russians .
it's too direct
do you like fat men?
what's your questionnaire , guys?
looks interesting
tell him
it's a questionnaire for women
about the ideal man
wide subject
can i ask you something?
go ahead
what's your name?
baptiste
nice to meet you
nino , russian from ltaly
ask your question !
paco , spanish from catalonia
great
ivory coaster from brittany
how did you meet your girlfriend?
that's easy .
by playing " good morning france
what's the matter?
good morning france "?
i know .
i saw on tv one day ...
no , it's a game i made up with some pals
it's fun .
it goes like this
there are three of us , all at separate tables
got it?
somebody walks by
if it's my turn , i say " good morning
if he says " good morning " back , i score a point
if he doesn't ...
okay
why " france "?
because the passersby are french
we're not french
who cares?
anyone can play
not everyone in france is french .
if it's a girl you get two points
that's good
good morning !
'morning
i get a point
do kids count?
no
good morning !
zero
one point for me check out the dog !
he scores three points .
get it?
go back where you belong
i already am
no points for me , obviously !
good morning , girls
that makes four
not three?
three for you
i'm in the lead
good morning france !
have to take the stairs .
the elevator's down
never mind let's go
wait a second .
tell me one thing
i'm going to ask you something .
tell me ... frankly and directly
i never ask direct questions but i have to ask this one
get the fuck on with it !
wait ...
ask the question !
is your girlfriend nice?
great question !
she's wonderful , she's nice
where are the stairs?
over there
look out , nino .
you'll hurt yourself
we'll make it , you'll see

concentrate your strength instead of fucking singing !
wait ...
help me
that's it .
go right , right !
i mean left , left
okay , let's go
go on , go on !

this is no time for a women's questionnaire !
i told you she was nice .
go on , explain to her
we'd like ... if you could ...
he said you could ...

i'll explain .
wait , paco
we met this great guy , pastis .

baptiste
what we want , my own sweet love , is for you to type their questionnaire
what questionnaire?
a questionnaire about a poll .
a poll ...
what poll?
first let me say your husband is great
we know that .
everyone knows i'm a breton and bretons are ...
wait , wait , baptiste
it's about a questionnaire because paco and i , we're studying philosophy .
we're doing a ...
why do you always laugh?
shit !
let me explain
wait , wait !
honey , honey
they need a questionnaire for an opinion poll
but tell me ...
about the ideal man
you take their list it's not about women?
good night .
sleep well
thanks a lot
if you need anything , just ask
miss quelec?
this is an opinion poll
an opinion poll
oh , yes .
about what?
do you like a man who shows philosophy in his life?
yes
passionately , a lot , a little , very little , or not at all?
a lot passionately?
a lot
good .
for you , does the ideal man necessarily have to be french?
no , not necessarily
in that case , i suppose even ... if he's russian ...
why not?
do you like victor hugo?
i've never read victor hugo .
i'd say ... i don't know
okay , never mind
it really doesn't matter
you have beautiful eyes thank you
it's true ask me your questions !
how would you describe your ideal man?
ideal man?
i don't know
i'd say ... he's a good driver
would you rather he was tall , thin , beefy , small ... or you don't mind how he's built?
he should be average height and strong
i haven't got " strong " .
beefy , thin ...
beefy , average height
what if he's small but has tons of charm?
as long as he's taller than me
a bit taller?
let's say not smaller
right
actually ...
how tall are you?
five feet two
five two .
i'll note it just in case
so , upwards of five two ...

how's the vote count going?
it's going fine
there's a very interesting one amongst the chicks i met
this one .

how can we do it?
i've thought of that .
as we have her address
i can meet her accidentally on purpose
you'll see , she's nice
i'll try to meet her in a bar for a drink and as soon as the mood is right
i'll make up a reason to leave and it's over to you
you think she'll come?
she'll come .
i think so .
if not , she would have refused
you think it'll work?
you have a lot of attributes

let's sit at a table .
it looks more respectable and that way we'll see her coming .
okay?

yes , quite a lot
around and about
that's why i'm a bit ...
do you travel in france or abroad?
in france mostly .
abroad as well
around and about
you live from day to day

i don't know .
i'm expecting a wiretransfer in a few days
all right .
but on the last evening
last evening?
the evening before you go
preferably a tuesday or thursday , when the kids are at my sister's
hi !
sit down
this is my friend antoine
all set !
it's been arranged .
two beds for two nights
the shelter manager is nice , eh?
yeah , we talked .
he's a cool guy
do you think ... he would lend me some money till the wire comes through?
do they do that?
he can ask , yeah?
the effect she has on me ... is incredible
you've really got to see her
what about marinette?
i'm all mixed up
she still matters enormously ... and all this is because of her
god , this woman is ...
and she intimidates me , you know?
she has a personality ...
i don't know ...
something ... incredible
can you write?
what?
can you write?
of course i can write
i don't mean that
can you write fancy sentences , phrases?
yeah , why?
help me write a letter for antoine , okay?
maybe you could start by ... giving him your news .
tell him how things are going
i think he wants to say , " dad , it's no good .
i feel bad
you can't start a letter with " dad , it's no good
why not?
i think it's an okay start
dad , it's no good ...
what do you think , antoine?
it's not a bad start
i don't know
i don't think much of it
suggest something else
what do you want , antoine?
what i want is impossible
yeah , but ... if it was possible , what would you want?
if it was possible , i'd want to go home
that's where he lives there?
i've been thinking .
it's better if ...
it's not so good if we both go
we need one person who looks respectable
you could be right
in that jacket ...
you have a jacket too .
you go
no , wait !
look , mine's not very smart
it's fine .
it's better if you go
you know antoine better and you know the hard life
is antoine's dad in?
good morning ...
it's about antoine ...
are you his father?
yes .
is he in trouble?
no , no
it's a letter ... from antoine to you
i just came to deliver it
a letter?
he never wrote to me before
you know it's very hard to be separated from someone you want to be with , especially when it's your father
he mucked around .
he made his choice
yes , but ... mucking around can sometimes help you see more clearly
i won't have him setting a bad example for the kids
yes , but the homeless shelter isn't his place
he should've thought of that
wait .
let me tell you something
you know ... if you don't have love it can be very hard
i'm sure it's gonna work !
he's a great guy
i'm sure he's gonna phone him .
it's gonna work
we'll see with antoine .
nice work

no
would you have slept with him?

you sleep ... just like that?
no , i don't sleep just like that
how , then?
i'm going to tell you something very few people know
you want to hear?
a long time ago ... 14 years ago , the age of my eldest son ...
i was very much in love with a man
i wanted to have a baby with him
it happened , and then he didn't want it .
he left
i was very miserable
i got over it and discovered the joy of having a child
an immense joy ,
like nothing i'd ever known
i wanted to do it again , give him brothers and sisters
i wanted loads of them but never a man so i wouldn't be let down
so i had more kids , but always with somebody passing through
they all have different fathers and none of the fathers know
there
you know ...
it's funny , but ... when i saw you ...
i realized how very alone i am
it made me want to be with you
if i have one more , it'll be with you
you mean it?
i wanted you to know
and i want you to know ... if you want to stay , it's okay with me
okay?
big smile?
was it fine?
you're looking good this morning
are you angry?
no , i'm not angry .
on the contrary
it's good like this .
very good
otherwise i might have screwed up in terms of marinette ...
it's much better this way
you like it?
it's great
how about mine?
yours is nice
nathalie will like it , eh?
thanks a lot
you have a nice guitar

can i ask you to do something?
will you come with me?
come with you?
yeah
that way you can go first
go first?
if you go first , you can talk to her
because ... if she says no ...
i might not be able ... to handle it
don't park too close , so she won't see me
my name's nino

he's here
don't bother
where are you going?
don't we go back to the house?
