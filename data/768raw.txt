911 .
what is your emergency?
im tired of the way things are , as opposed to the way they should be .
is this an emergency?
where are you located?
that really doesnt matter .
can we have your name? of course .
common denominator .
your man on the street .
now dont ask another question , or i will be obliged to do bad .
andyou would have to assume responsibility .
no interruptions .
natural selection .
natural selection .
born to win .
born to lose .
born to die .
three situations that make up everything in the world .
no interference is necessary .
but interference happens .
people interfere with an important task
i enjoy doing .
i dont believe people are not good by nature , not at all .
so ifyou remove the authority , the police ,
then youil see life as god intended it to be .
a world ofpandemonium .
without police , the weak and diseased would be gone .
streets red with blood .
the way nature intended it to be .
there will be another body found tonight .
thank you foryour time .
april fool , right?
youre kidding , right?
youve picked a very fine diamond .
iil tell you what , throw in a car and iil take it .
throw in a hand , iil take it .
perhaps a lesser gem would be more appropriate?
nah , its perfect .
go !
go !
go !
go !
whats up , malloy?
youre losing your touch .
heil get you in the rematch .
dont you worry , buddy .
i got plans tonight and they dont include you guys .
iil get killed if i dont go .
sheil be pissed anyway .
one more round isnt gonna make a rats ass difference .
i forgot i was dealing with the stable relationship brain trust here .
you guys ever heard of quittin while youre ahead?
you got a little drinking problem in this area over here .
give this guy another pop .
you feds any closer to nailing that son of a bitch?
what dyou wanna hear?
i got him giftwrapped out in the trunk .
were gettin close .
thats bullshit .
no , were getting close .
i hope so .
tucker didnt deserve that .
no cop does .
hes puttin bodies on display like trophies .
son of a bitch knows were the ones who have to look at em , thats why .
look , id love to tell you we got this guy ready for a toe tag and a slab .
but were dealin with a different kind of street logic here .
its a whole different breed .
theres no repeatable patterns .
theres no identifiable method .
hes targeting cops , different precincts , different times .
every sites clean .
but hes gonna fuck up .
they all do .
when he does , weil nail him .
come on , malloy .
weve had nine dead cops inside of six months .
if this was nine dead feds we were talkin about , that would be a different story .
a different story?
you really think i give a shit what kind of badge a man wears?
i think youre feelin guilty because you and your fed friends are droppin the ball .
what happened to you , malloy?
you used to be one of us before you became a fed .
ease up .
were all on the same team here .
yeah , ease up .
you finished?
oh , yeah , everyone here knows im an asshole .
you got that right .
you are an asshole .
everyone knows that .
thats a fact of life .
bring these guys anything they want , please .
just keep their mouths full .
wake up , sleeping beauty .
you wanna tell me why you were late for dinner?
very funny .
got an excuse?
sorry .
how was donovans?
how do you know i was at donovans?
cos i called .
no , you didnt .
no , i didnt .
that was my imitation of your ex wife .
ouch .
come on , dont go there .
what happened to our date?
these guys are goin through a bad time , so i was just talkin to them a little bit .
its always gonna be somethin .
if not this , somethin else , mary .
what is this?
the beginning of a " youre just too good for me " speech?
is that what this is?
stop bustin me already .
lucky for you , ive been checking out the competition , and the pickings are pretty damn slim , so i was thinking , what the hell?
why not stay with me?
are you tryin to tell me somethin , huh?
maybe .
maybe not .
i have a surprise .
i got this great surprise , but its gonna have to keep for a while .
im gonna give it to you , but i wanna have a clear head when i do .
whatever happened to roses?
roses?
obviously you havent been reading cosmopolitan .
obviously .
romantically speaking , roses are totally obsolete and monkeys are the new language of love .
i didnt know that .
well , if thats the case ... why dont you and your little friend come to bed?
i think we just got lucky .
forget it .
i work alone .
i could have made it myself , you know .
and you would have gotten another dul .
hey , jimmy , are you gonna tuck me in?
christ .
jimmy?
what the hell is this?
a treasure hunt?
everybody make sure you step on every damn thing you can .
you see anything you want , just take it on home .
friend of yours?
yeah .
a long time .
i cant find any sign of gunpowder tattooing .
the shooter was most likely several feet back .
he was in whispering distance .
see the starburst splitting of the skin here , doc?
gun was pressed directly against the head .
the killer wanted him to feel the barrel .
nine dead cops inside of six months .
if this was nine dead feds we were talkin about , that would be a different story .
lets cut him down .
how long do you plan to have him hang there?
junior hasnt finished analysing the body .
what do you think youre gonna find?
why dont you get that club out of his throat?
hes a cop !
let me handle this .
fine .
hello?
let me speak with agent malloy .
its for you .
thanks .
its malloy .
you andyour friend were out late .
who is this?
tell me , malloy , what do you see in that dead cop s eyes?
do you see recrimination?
because its your fault .
who is this?
theyve all died because of you .
what are you talkin about?
weil get to that .
but first things first .
you know , shes got a lovely place here .
nice neighbourhood .
it almost looked safe ... until now .
you really should have stayed home and played house , instead of playing hunter .
hes at my house .
her name is mary , right?
iil bet she has nice eyes .
hes at my fuckin house !
1311 oak !
westside .
go !
go !
come on , mary .
pick up the goddamn phone !
send all available units .
im sorry , but mary cant come to the phone right now .
what do you want?
youre the agent in charge ofmy case , arent you?
thats right , so whatever you gotta do , do it to me !
i am doing it to you , malloy .
and im doing it to her .
you still havent told me what you want .
four years ago you were in charge ofan investigation ofa series ofmurders .
atrocities against prostitutes .
i call it removing diseased filth .
you got very close to getting me .
youd rather protect them and remove me .
you made my life hell .
so now im returning the favour .
keep him talking , jake .
hunting the hunter .
i wont live long .
the odds are against that .
so what time i have left , i will dedicate to you .
iil always be close , like hide and seek .
now , about mary ...
to kill a man is easy , but kill what he loves and he dies a thousand times .
please dont hurt her .
please .
iil see you , butyou wont see me .
mary !
mary !
mary !
mary !
where is she?
mary !
mary !
oh , jeez .
agent hendricks !
we got him .
hey , tommy !
whats the story?
security guard spotted him covered in blood , dressed in swat gear .
son of a bitch didnt say a word , just opened fire .
guard ok?
he took one in the leg .
lost a lot of blood .
called for backup before he passed out .
i see you , you see me .
you on the roof , identify yourself .
identify yourselfnow .
this is the police .
you buyin shares in this place?
hey .
kill me again .
listen to me .
i ...
ive been diggin around .
theres this place out in wyoming .
its a detox centre .
just hear me out this time .
its run by a former cop for cops .
you know ... if shed never met me , never knew me , shed still be alive .
im where i wanna be , where i should be .
thats where i am .
ok .
iil make you a deal .
you blow your brains out like a damn man and stop pissing on marys memory one sorry ass day at a time , and iil take care of your tab .
what the fuck is ...? !
whats the matter with you? !
its all right , everybody .
a little accident .
everybody relax .
whats the matter with you? !
whether you like it or not , you still got a life to live .
it doesnt end here .
do you believe in reincarnation?
transmigration of the soul?
any of that stuff?
i do believe i was a shitkicker in a previous life .
well ... nothing a few nice curtains couldnt fix up .
hey , look , partner , if you ever need to return the favour , make it miami .
we run a dual diagnosis programme here .
a fancy way of saying were gonna detox your ass and then tackle your demons head on in group sessions .
i was a cop for 12 years before i took a shot at drinking myself to death .
so i know what keeps you up at night .
gonna make it all go away , huh?
not even gonna try .
no magic wands here .
the shit you swallowed doesnt digest .
you carryin a weapon , mr malloy?
iil have to confiscate it .
need the shield , too .
we dont allow crutches here .
thought id stick around awhile , burn up a little vacation time , maybe even rent me a cabin .
do some ice fishing?
yeah , why not?
see if i cant catch more than a shot glass .
hey , this is gonna be a piece of cake .
doc .
the mans my better half .
i sure as hell dont intend to lose him out here in jerkwater , wyoming .
do you follow me?
jack .
see if you cant find some boots and a parka for this man .
anything to serve these fine officers , doc .
you might run into more than a cool breeze up here .
come on .
lets get you checked in .
the place was built in the 50s as a command control centre for strategic air command .
satellites made the facility obsolete , so they converted it to a military asylum .
uncle sam put it on the market last year .
its isolated as hell and thats why i chose it .
youre the last of our patients to arrive .
you know the rules , slater .
no smoking in the rooms .
id like you to meet jake malloy .
we got nothin to hide here , including our names .
slater , metropolitan police department of london .
i know its a long way to come to quit the shakes .
club med was fully booked .
aint exactly betty ford , huh?
last place i was at was a twelve step health spa .
mud baths , nature walks .
we dont got tv here .
convicted felons , doc , get tv .
jaworski heres a narc .
and a hell of a sharpshooter .
shut up , limey !
nobodys talkin to you .
this is jake malloy , fbl .
hey , we got a fed gracin our presence .
hey , malloy , any idea of the three most overrated things in the world?
home cookin , home fuckin and the fbl .
lets get your blood and urine sample , see what were up against .
our resident psychiatrist was an air force consultant here for four years .
when the facility shut down , she signed on with us .
shes pulling double duty as a nurse , till we get fully staffed .
we used to take care of almost 100 patients here .
theres only ten of you cops .
but judging from your case files , i dont think anyones gonna be bored .
this is jack bennett , one of our orderlies .
jake malloy , new arrival .
if you need anything , ask jack .
he knows the place like the back of his hand .
thats what they say .
i know every inch of this nuthouse .
anything else , maam?
i dont think so .
manny , this is jake .
see if you can fatten him up .
hey .
hope you aint a vegetarian .
gilbert , say hi to jake .
hey , jake .

youre the caretaker , hank .
have you managed to get settled in?
first nights a bitch .
how long you been here?
couple of days .

fuckin motherfuckers motherfucked !
lopez .
lapd .
reverend jones .

this guy couldnt even swallow a bullet .
stupid fucker missed his brain and blew half his cheek out .
see the old guy?
mckenzie .
member of the royal canadian mounted police .
word is he froze up , let his partner get shot .
they put him on the rubber gun squad .
all right , lets get started .
this is what i call the witchin hour .
no lessons , no twelve steps .
this is your time .
they told me to put em in the bag .
the pieces .
they were so tiny .
little fingers .
every once in a while id get a whole hand or ... part of a leg .
mostly blood .
it was everywhere .
their little fingers were just ... rolling around .
i dropped it .
i ...
i tried to gather em up , but there was so much blood .
i can still smell it .
21 preschoolers were blown to pieces .
some of their fingers still had paint on em .
they were finger painting when it happened .
you got somethin to add , noah?
this aint the boy scouts .
this aint about helpin old ladies across the street .
hes just a kid .
oh , bullshit .
hes just weak , like the rest of you mamsy pamsy motherfuckers .
if you cant stand the smell of trash , why are you workin in the garbage business?
maybe hes not as strong as us .
maybe he never learned to like the smell .
you laugh it up , smiley .
you sure as shit wont see me swallowing my gun .
so what do you swallow?
a fifth of gin?
maybe a little speed?
it aint the same .
yes , it is .
lets be clear about somethin .
you people landed here for a reason .
its not just your careers youre killin .
booze may be a slow burn , but its still suicide .
de luxe cabin , my ass !
howd it go?
the first session .
i dont know .
what do you wanna hear?
i got no more demons , no more monsters?
we all have demons .
but i stopped believing in monsters when i was 12 .
thats cos you never met any .
dont be naive , jenny .
is that her ring?
look , i know you mean well , but youre in way over your head on this one .
do you think words are gonna make a difference , gonna change anything?
theyre not .
so just do yourself a favour and dont waste your time on me .
looks like were in for one .
you know , my mary had a scarf like that .
we cant have this goin on here !
keep out of everybody elses business .
dont jump over my ass .
hes the one ...
im sure he didnt mean anything by it .
its a misunderstanding .
yeah .
something like that .
the point is he ripped it off .
yeah !
fine .
suppose he ripped it off .
what do you wanna do about it?
did you take it?
jack?
maybe you should give it back .
thanks for the light , old timer .
stupid cops .
how you doin?
do you wanna get some air?
if you wanna talk , im right over here .

what are we gonna do?
break the news to the group .
hank , you get gilbert up here to help you move the body .
i think iil be goin with just a salad tonight .
did he leave a note?
none that i could find .
no offence , doc , but this mini alcatraz you got goin here aint gonna change a goddamn thing .
you may dry a few of em up , but you aint gonna change what theyre made of .
the boy was weak .
we all knew that .
it was just a matter of time before old humpty fell off the wall .
and what about dudley do right there , huh?
what a peach he is .
30 years of bullshit war stories , only to leave his partner for dead .
alone .
no one to watch his back .
theres nothin worse in my book than a goddamn yellow cop .
you see what i mean , doc?
you aint the wizard of oz here .
you cant just hand out courage .
youre real good at kickin em when theyre down , arent you?
do ok when theyre standing up , too .
you never stood up to anybody .
yeah?
well , at least im there for my women .
thats enough .
hey , doc !
check it out !
man overboard !

its in the office .
earthquake !
hes had alcohol .
whats wrong?
hes on disulfiram .
makes you puke if you even smell booze .
he looks bad .

looks like he swallowed a damn dog .
give us a hand .
what do you want me to do?

hold him still .
a little aqua velva over the rocks?
i rest my case , doc .
hold him .
i want everyones belts .

i want the rooms checked every hour on the hour .
anything you say , sheriff .
hey , you know that hospital about ten or so miles up the canyon?
you mean the old loony bin?
yeah , right .

your friend sick in the head , is he?
in more ways than one .
well , the lines are down .
you a cop?
thought so .

one took a cabin for the night , bought out all my scotch , damn near tore it down .
another looked like he shaved with a cheese grater .
so how are the fish biting?
you happen to see whats goin on outside?
its called the dead of winter .
i meant ice fishing .
id love to try my luck .
maybe you could help me out .
maybe .
fact is , you couldnt have picked a better time of year .
we both know that if someone really wants to kill themselves , theres no stopping it .
i know you have to believe that , jenny .
but i cant .
thats what this place is about .
stoppin em .
i dont get it .
why do you put yourself through this?
you got family , malloy?
no , i dont .
neither do i. no .
the job is all i got .
im not a coward , you know .
i know that .
but try and remind yourself now and then .
that goes both ways .
cant sleep?
i didnt mean to spook you .
i never knew .
knew you could miss someone so much?
i didnt know that .
just remember that sometimes the real bad things in life can make you stronger .
whats the matter , cowboy?
somebody steal your horse?
no , i just thought i heard something .
like what?
i dont know .
something .
cock a doodle doo !
good morning to you !

doc !
doc !
two suicides back to back? !
get mr fed in here .
hes seen his share of dead officers .
the bruise is in the shape of an inverted v.
what does that mean?
the markings say its a suicide .
the v is from the noose .
if he was strangled , itd be a straight line bruise .
hey , doc .
the waiting list for this place is getting shorter by the minute .
still taking bets on who the next suicides gonna be?
the man didnt say it was a suicide .
he just said the markings say that .
and god shall wipe away all the tears from their eyes .
and there shall be no more death .
neither shall there be any more pain .
im tearin up here , reverend
shit !
i cant risk finding any more bodies .
iil have to lock you in your rooms .
oh , you gotta be kiddin me !
i need to review everyones case files .
lookin for what?

and we got two bodies .

sweetcakes , shakes are the least of our worries .
you got a medical degree we dont know about?
let her talk !
im not talking about the shakes .
grand mal seizure caused by dts ... can kill you .

maybe you should tell them about jack .
hey , lady?
what the hell is he talkin about?
i dont know .
bullshit !
you tell em , or i will .
jenny , docs missing .
two men are dead .
if theres something you need to tell us , now is the time .
you should check his service record .

the guy was a patient here .
oh , thats great !
the son of a bitch murdered his commanding officer over in south korea .
strangled him .
psycho !
and you gave this crazy fuck a job? !
come on , lopez !
back off .
since when did protecting women become your specialty , malloy?
youre right .
its not .
my specialty ... is doing my job ... while the one good thing in my life is home , being butchered .
you talk about her again , im gonna kill you .
howd jack end up working here?
i vouched for him .
he was totally rehabilitated .

i know that .
hey , people !
gilbert found doc .
jones .
jaworski .

youre tellin me this guys a cop?
well , thats what he said .

i need to get up there .
whoever did this must have used a sledge .
they hammered the living shit out of these carburettors .
the snowmobiles are finished .

the freezers fillin up fast .
i think hes right .
hank , take jenny and gilbert .
manny can help with the digging .
no .
weeks cant be moved .
we need someone here with medical expertise .
its not a request .
you dont have to be here .
where would i be safer?
riding through a whiteout with some yahoo like hank , or sitting here in a room full of armed officers?
how about you?
no way .
im gonna go down with the ship .
you guys go while theres still some light .
were outta here !
cmon , gilbert , lets go .

i almost got lost in the blizzard .
im coming back through the utility tunnels when malloy comes in .
hes not just down there for a walk , so i hide behind the woodpile , ok?
its not malloy .
i was with him .
he went out there to help you .
well , what do i know? !
malloy should stay locked in my cell .
just to be safe .
yeah?
tell you what ... you dont have to be a fed to read a flashing sign .
maybe its time for reverend jones to explain the artwork !
dont you ever paw me , boy .
you understand?
maybe malloy was right about one of us not being a cop .
somebody was out there in that storm .
if it wasnt hank , or malloy , who was it?
you were outside looking for tracks , right?
right .
and i got locked out .
did you?

ignorant assholes .

i didnt think youd mind me borrowing his name and his badge .
from there , it was easy .
ijust came here and blended in .
youre real good at blending in , arent ya , scumbag?
is that how you found out about this place?
just blending in at the cop bar?
that doesnt matter now .
what matters is i got to you before you got to me .

just the opposite .
an insane man could not have accomplished this .
all these deaths , including marys , werent irrational .
