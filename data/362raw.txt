good god .
matthew .
matthew .
matthew .
they say your whole life flashes before your eyes when you die .
and it's true , even for a blind man .
i grew up in hell's kitchen .
the politicians and the real estate developers call it clinton now .
but a neighborhood , like everything else , has a soul .
and souls don 't change with a name .
come on , hit me .
i'ii give you a free shot .
hit him again .
you fight iike your dad .
come on , hit me .
my dad's gonna be champ .
your dad's a bum .
yeah , a bum .
come on .
hit me .
yeah , he's a punk , man .
can't fight .
sure can run though .
pathetic .
my father was a boxer .
a sportswriter once wrote that he fought like the devil ... ... and the name stuck .
jack " the devil " murdock was a contender .
but that was a long time ago .
come on , dad .
get up .
who won?
colan .
yeah?
i beat him , you know .
i know , dad .
tko .
and i beat sharpman , robbers , wagner .
hey , hey , what's that?
nothing .
i told you i didn't want you fighting .
they said that you work for failon .
that you're one of his guys now .
get over here .
sit down .
come on .
think i'd be puiling double overtime at the docks if i was working for failon?
what are you , nuts?
you don't hit nothing but books .
get me?
you be a doctor or a iawyer .
not iike me .
dad . . . .
matt , you can do it .
you can do anything if you're not afraid .
now , you promise me .
i promise , dad .
one day , i took a shortcut home from school .
what i saw , i'll never forget ... ... because it would be the last thing i'd ever see .
jack , i don't want you to hurt me .
i wiil .
jack , come on .
i had other obligations .
dad?
okay , i got it .
matt?
matt !
i'm sorry , matty .
i'm so sorry .
it's okay , dad .
it's okay .
we made each other a silent promise ... ... to never give up .
to be fearless .
to stick up for the long shots like us .
we were two fighters on the comeback trail .
i had lost my sight , but i got something back in return .
my remaining four senses functioned with superhuman sharpness .
but most amazing of all , my sense of sound gave off a kind of radar sense .
high above the roar of the streets , i trained my body and my senses .
an acute sense of touch gave me both strength and balance ... ... until the city itself became my playground .
i was the boy without fear .
murdock !
hey , murdock !
round two .
what's up , freak?
look at him , man .
look at his eyes .
kick his ass .
go ahead , fight me .
i dare you .
yeah , murdock .
i dare you .
yeah , that's what i'm saying , man .
kick his ass .
come on , man , iet's just go .
okay .
jack , it's been a while .
i don't work for you no more , failon .
jack , you never stopped .
did you reaily think you won those fights on your own?
you're 42 years old .
miiler , mack , bendis .
they're aii my fighters .
just iike you .
and now it's your turn to take a fail .
think about your boy , jack .
i'm sure you'll do the right thing .
no , come on , dad !
come on , dad , get up !
you can do it , dad .
come on !
come on , dad .
get up !
come on !
let's go !
come on !
come on , dad !
get up !
never give up .
yeah , yeah !
come on , dad .
aii right !
yeah !
you aii right?
murdock , you aii right?
okay , iet's fight .
down !
he's out .
fight's over .
ladies and gentlemen , the winner , by way of knockout . . . . . . jack " the devil " murdock !
this one was for you , matty .
i waited outside of the olympic for my father .
in some ways , i'm still waiting .
finish him off .
dad !
i can't see you , dad .
i can't see you .
no one cared much about the death of a washed up prizefighter .
nobody but me .
i would keep my promise .
i would help those that others wouldn 't .
i would seek justice .
one way or another .
ladies and gentlemen , justice is blind . . . . . . but it can be heard .
and today , the truth wiii come out .
mr. quesada , would you state for the court . . . . . . the sequence of events ieading up to the night of june 30?
i stopped off at josie's bar after work .
i had a few drinks .
angela was there .
she was closing up .
she asked me if i wanted to stick around for some fun .
anything that happened after that was entirely consensual .
are you aware that perjury is a crime , mr. quesada?
objection .
my client's a respectable member of the community .
miss sutton has a history of drug  my client's not on trial .
her testimony is suspect  nor is her testimony suspect .
gentlemen , that's enough .
the truth is , mr. murdock , is that miss sutton . . . .
miss sutton enjoyed every minute of it .
mr. quesada , for your sake , i hope justice is found here today . . .
. . . before justice finds you .
that's not right .
another rapist back on the streets .
yeah?
here's what i don't get .
how can a scumbag iike quesada afford an attorney iike hirsh?
he can't .
the kingpin's gotta be footing the biil .
come on .
let's go get drunk .
not tonight .
i got work to do .
right here .
hey .
what's up?
you gotta take that .
big neck , come on .
i can't believe
what was her name?
to the justice system , right?
of course i beat it .
kingpin's got my back , bro .
how you doing , sweetie?
boss?
what's up?
what's up with that?
is that guy for real?
yeah , he's for real .
what do you want?
justice .
oh , god .
oh , god !
hi .
how you doing?
didn't you hear?
i was acquitted .
not by me .
hey , that iight at the end of the tunnel?
guess what .
that's not heaven .
i'ii kiii you !
i'ii kiii you !
that's the c train .
i'ii kiii you !
oh , god !
hey , you can't go past there .
caii charlie .
right .
you're wasting your time , urich .
there's nothing to see here .
jose quesada .
and the rest of jose quesada .
whole iot of nothing , huh?
keep running those stories . . . . . . and we'ii end up with copycat vigilantes who'ii get themselves kiiled .
are you here to confirm that daredevii is responsible for this , detective?
come on , urich .
stop busting my
there is no proof that your so cailed daredevii was involved . . . . . . nor that he even exists .
got it?
got it .
can one man make a difference?
there are days when i believe .
and others when i have lost all faith .
matt , it's heather .
are you there?
of course you're not there .
you're never there .
at least not for me .
look , i didn 't want to do this over the phone ... ... but it's not like you've given me any choice .
it's been three months now , and i've never even seen your apartment .
every time we sleep together , i wake up in the morning alone .
i mean , jesus , where do you go at 3 : 00 in the morning?
i thought that if i waited , if i was patient enough , you'd let me in .
that we'd take our relationship to the next level .
then i realized that this is the next level .
goodbye , matt .
i hope you find what you're looking for .
forgive me , father , for i have sinned .
it's been a week since  what are you playing at , matt?
you didn't come here for forgiveness .
you want permission , and i can't give you that .
justice isn't a sin , father .
no , but vengeance is .
you see it every day on the streets .
violence just begets more violence .
is that how you want to iive your iife?
a iawyer during the day . . . . . . and then judge and jury at night .
is that what you want?
somebody has to do something .
weil , why you?
because i can .
because i'm not afraid .
weil , i'm afraid for you , matthew .
look , a man without fear is a man without hope .
may god have mercy on you , forgive you and grant you everlasting iife .
amen .
i'm not too crazy about the outfit either .
eyewitnesses say quesada was singled out . . . . . . by the demonic vigilante known as the daredevil .
i don't know why you read that .
there's gotta be something to it .
like the ailigators in the sewers?
there are ailigators in the sewers .
a friend in sanitation has seen them .
fine .
just drop it .
you should see this guy .
they got this picture .
they have a picture?
it's a drawing , an artist's rendering .
it's just it's grotesque .
i'd hate to see his therapy biils .
speaking of biils . . . . . . your client , mr. lee , made his first payment .
great .
you should be very happy .
yeah , it's fantastic .
he paid in fluke .
fluke is a fish .
did you know that?
i didn't .
mr. lee is a good man and doesn't have much money . . . . . . and he fishes on weekends .
i guess it's
i salsa dance on weekends , but i don't shake my ass to pay my phone biil .
wiii you pass the honey , please?
we need better clients .
i'm tired of pro bono cases .
what is your problem with our clients?
we have good , honorable clients .
what's your idea of better?
define " better .
what would be a better client?
better means rich and guilty , okay?
law schooi taught us to create a morai vacuum . . . . . . so you can represent people who aren't innocent .
that was your best course , as i recail .
you don't have a morai vacuum .
you are completely vacuum iess .
what?
what?
where?
where?
where?
front door .
not yet , soon .
now .
teii me .
you want the truth?
absolutely .
she's hideous .
i don't know if it's a fungus or some congenitai birth defect . . . . . . but as your attorney in this matter , i advise you to take no further action .
i'm sorry .
excuse me .
sure .
i was iooking for some honey .
could you help me out?
right in front of you .
weil , could you be a iittle bit more specific?
what are you?

you know , i've never seen him before .
matt murdock .
nice to meet you , matt murdock .

sure you don't wanna teii me your name?
you're holding back .

does every guy have to go through this to find out your name?
try asking for my number .

okay .
my name's elektra natchios .
what's wrong , wesley?
have you seen the papers today?
somebody's been talking .
somebody always does .
natchios , my dear , old friend .
i'm getting out , wilson .
i am out .
you think it's funny?
they're writing about the kingpin .
they're going back to the beginning .
weil , i'm tired of iooking over my shoulder .
i want to put that behind me .
i want you to buy me out .
i think you'ii find it's a very generous offer .
so , what do you say?
how's your daughter?
you okay?
i. . . .
i think i'ii be okay .
i'm not gonna iie and say it doesn't hurt .
where did you iearn to fight iike that?
my father .
he had me study with a different sensei every year since i was 5 .
sounds iike he wanted to turn you into some kind of a warrior .
no .
just not a victim .
watch your step .
thank you .
i didn't even
wait .
how did you do that?
how did you do the park?
i don't know , growing up in the kitchen , a blind kid .
you iearn how to iook out for yourself .
see that?
he just ran that iight .
i want you to create a paper trail , one that can be traced to natchios .
sir?
the press want a kingpin .
so i'ii give them a kingpin .
get me builseye .
two out of three .
bloody irish piece of trash .
i said i was sorry .
what do you want?
details .
you owe me that .
her name's elektra natchios .
she sounds iike a mexican appetizer .
it's greek , genius .
her father's nikolaos natchios .
the biilionaire?
yeah , see .
yes , the biilionaire .
as your attorney , i advise you to marry her immediately .
i'ii take it under consideration .
susie is my son larry's daughter by his first marriage .
she eloped with this semi colored feilow from london .
what's the word for that?
mulatto .
just iet's say he had a iittle cream in his coffee .
but he did very weii for himself on the internet .
but don't ask me how .
no .
you know , they did get me a computer for christmas iast year . . . . . . but i refuse .
i'm afraid it's going to explode .
but who can afford to fly these days?
but then my sister marjorie cailed and said she had these frequent flier miles . . . . . . and she couldn't use them because of her sciatic nerve .
so i said
she's sleeping .
can i get you anything before we iand?
more peanuts , please .
yo , taxi !
that's over on seventh .
you don't remember me?
thanks , buddy .
how can you not remember the kingpin?
no , no , no , no .
please !
no , please , no !
you remember me now?
what are you , stupid?
you think you could hold out on the kingpin?
huh?
get away from me !
stay out of heil's kitchen .
this ain't your neighborhood no more .
kitchen belongs to the kingpin now .
please .
please don't hurt me .
i'm not the bad guy , kid .
i'm not the bad guy .
i'm not .
i have to caii you back because he just came in .
morning .
your ears must have been burning .
why?
this just came by messenger .
your invitation to the black & white baii at the grand .
plus one .
plus one?
aii right .
guess i gotta rent a tux .
wow .
they spent some serious money on this invitation .
i mean , you should feei it .
it's engraved .
what time are you gonna pick me up?
i'm not going .
what?
are you crazy?
that place is gonna be crawling with rich people .
people who pay iegai fees with money , not with fish .
or with wheels of cheese .
or with sports supplies .
i'm gonna fiii you in on a secret .
this place doesn't iook iike a iaw office .
it iooks iike the set of sanford and son .
i'm waiting for lamont to walk in .
then you go .
look at me , matt .
i'm a plus one .
plus ones don't get anywhere alone .
they need somebody to bring them .
are you finished?
we only have an hour to prepare for court .
what's eating you?
rough night .
weil , you want to talk about it?
no .
it's about elektra , isn't it?
no .
natchios owns the grand hotel , and elektra's the reason you were invited .
she's out of my ieague , and i'd rather end it before it starts .
that's gotta be some record .
you just completely bypass the relationship . . . . . . you went right into the breakup .
trying to save some time?
what happens to that iie detector of yours when it detects your own buil?
let's reaily bury the needle , huh?
swish .
look , matt , seriously , the bail's in your court .
so does this mean you want a rematch?
i knew i'd find you .
how did you know i wasn't a mugger?
muggers don't usuaily wear rose oii or high heels .
at ieast this far from chelsea .
come here .
there's something i wanna show you .
wait a second .
exactly how many women have you brought up here , anyway?
you're my first .
good answer .
i thought that was the right answer .
look at this .
it's so beautiful .
i know .
this was my favorite view of the city when i was a kid .
i reaily wanted you to see this .
what's this?
that's from my mother .
for good iuck .
it's beautiful .
it's a good iuck charm , huh?
i could use one of those .
do they make them in braiile?
she gave it to me right before she died .
what happened?
i should go .
no .
just wait .
no , i'm gonna go  wait , wait , wait .
it's about to rain .
no , it's not .
it is .
i'm teiling you , it's
the temperature dropped two or three degrees .

weil , yes , among other things .

my partner
i foilowed that piece you wrote about the kingpin .
one man running aii the crime in new york city sounds a iittle far fetched .
yeah , but , then again , so does a vigilante who thinks every day is hailoween .
they gotta be huge by now , right , the ailigators?
it's a myth .
look , i'd iike you to give me a cail

i'm sorry , mr. fisk .
my partner is a iittle overzealous .
