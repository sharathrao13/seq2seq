they were my two best friends in the whole world .
for five weeks .
it was a total accident we even met .
me , a bum from brooklyn using phoney frequent flyer miles .
tony croft was kind of a golden boy from harvard school of architecture .
we met lewis mcbride , this long haired greenpeace tree hugger guy .
so the plan was to party till we ran out of cash in malaysia .
it was a paradise of rum , girls , and good , cheap hash .
whoo !
whoo !
i don't understand a word you're saying to me .
but this is my least favourite part anyway , the talking stuff .
do you know what i mean?
hm .

what did you do that for?
it's my last day , lew .

we'll go do some stuff .
maybe it shouldn't be your last day .
maybe it shouldn't .
maybe you should get a haircut .
wow !
you're up early .
what kind of party's this?
my party .
your party?
oh , yeah .
it's your aggressive instincts .

let the bike go , brother .
i'm not gonna leave it .
lewis , the deposit we put down on that bike is five times its worth .
why are you pushing the fucking bike?
i'm not gonna leave it .
this is his bread and butter .
you're out of your mind .
maybe if you helped me out .
we'd go so much quicker .
here , i'll push it .
i'll push the fucking thing .

thank you .

borneo .

no .
i got the orang utan reintroduction project .
the what project?
this group rescues orang utans that have been kept as pets , and integrates them back in the wild .
i'm gonna go down and volunteer .
bro ', if the apes need humans to save them , then they're fucked .
pay no attention to him .
he's always dumping on somebody .
that's cool .
what about you , golden boy?
you can't wait to put all those things you call buildings up in new york .
skyscrapers .
no , man , they'll be beautiful .
touching the clouds .
you guys don't realise how good you have it right now , right here .
so eager to get on with your charmed lives that you miss what's happening now .
you know what i mean?
we got mellow hash , right?
we got coconuts filled with rum .
we got beautiful , gracious chicks that like us just cos we're yankees and tall .
some of us .
and you've got this warm , calm water .
it's like god's own bathtub or something , man .
hey , lew , are you really gonna stay here and try to save those gorillas?
yeah .
that's cool , man .
that's totally cool , lew .
totally cool .
you sound , uh , interested .
you wanna join me?
the flight's tomorrow .
can't change the ticket .
no refund .
think about it .
morning .
hey , good morning , man .
how do you feel?
good , good .
so?
is it civilisation and its discontents or uh ... you , me and the monkeys?
i don't think i'm cut out for that kind of thing , lew .
that's for you , man .
to tell you the truth ...
i don't have that kind of stuff in me .
well , i think you're wrong about yourself , but ...
give 'em hell .
where are you gonna go?
new york is calling you home .
martinis , pretty girls , the yankees .
or do you want to stay here?
don't smoke it all in one bowl .
you keep this .
i got tony's .
i wouldn't take excedrin out of this country .
why did we buy so much hash?
at those prices we had to .
uh oh .
well , i guess this is it , man .
yeah?
see ya , buddy .
good luck .
i'm gonna miss you guys .
bullshit .
you'll find a couple of chimps prettier than both of us .
you fucker .
take care .
i'll see you .
all right .
safe travels .
yeah , gaby , listen .
yeah .
ok .
you know what?
no , i just , you know , i can't talk about anything right now .
listen uh ...
no , i'm not interested in discussing this right now .
i got two people in the back of my car .
i'm working .
gaby , maybe when this shift's over , i'll call you , we'll grab a bite , ok?
that's my dispatcher .
i gotta go .
i gotta go .
bye .
yeah , it's four , under way .
can you sling a pick up at the stanhope?
lady named eastern , asked for you .
eastern?
eastern , yeah .
where's the drop at?
she didn't say .
fuck !
i apologise for the sudden stop , folks , but hopefully you were belted in .
ok .
here we are .
here .
take that .
pleasure serving you as always , mr homer .
this is ravitch .
hey , it's sheriff .
how much is a famous divorce attorney worth to you?
he's worth squat , brother .
i'm single .
what if he's out boinking and getting bombed and his wife's not with him?
that's a different story .
ravitch , can't you find another desk?
i say two bills .
you're a cheap son of a bitch .
grab a pen .
i'm sorry .
ok , give it to me .
thank you .
we headed anywhere in particular?
how about we just drive around the park for a bit?
you got it .
around the park .
i haven't driven you before .
i never forget a face .
do you mind if i smoke in the car?
it's the only place in town left that you can smoke .
go ahead .
so who recommended me , miss eastern?
please call me beth .
ok .
who recommended me , beth?
lewis mcbride .
lew?
did he say to look up old sheriff when you got to town?
how did you know where to find me?
lewis said you lived in brooklyn .
odds were you'd be in the book .
yeah , huh?
and odds were i'd still be stuck in brooklyn , which obviously i am .
so where is lew?
is he in town here?
sheriff , the day you and tony left penang , a man came looking for a bike you guys had rented .
he brought the police .
only they didn't find the bike , but they did find 104 grams of hashish , some stashed in the hut , some in the trash .
jesus christ .
and lewis caught hell for that , huh?
yeah .
he's spent the last two years in prison .
oh , my god .
jesus christ .
what a nightmare that must be , huh?
is he still in prison now?
for eight more days , yeah .
i wish i'd have known sooner .
i don't know if i could have done anything but ...
at least he's getting out in eight days though , huh?
that's not the case .
anybody found with more than 100 grams of hashish is considered to be trafficking .
trafficking?
what is that , like , dealing?
sheriff , in order for lewis not to be considered a dealer , you and tony have to fly back to penang and accept your share of the responsibility .
and what about me and tony?
what happens to us?
the deal was that if both of you go back , it's three years apiece , and if only one of you goes back , it's six .
wait .
hold on .
it's three?
it's six?
finish that sentence for me please .
you're talking about three years in prison .
six years in prison .
let me make this clear to you .
in malaysia , dealers get death .
jesus christ , for a shitty brick of hash?
so in eight days from now ...
lewis mcbride is going to hang .
what are you , his lawyer?
i'm his american lawyer , yeah .
so how about we have dinner and talk more about this?
i can't .
i'm on till 2 : 00 .
but thank you very much .
drinks then?
at 2 : 00?
don't you sleep?
i want to do this more .
breakfast?
can't .
lunch?
i pulled a day shift .
let's have dinner then .
tomorrow night .
here .
say 7 : 00?
tomorrow at 7 : 00 .
night .
thanks .
excuse me , i'm looking for tony croft .
yeah , he's up top .
thanks .
so if you don't go back , tony , lewis will hang .
sorry .
you can't come out of nowhere and tell me the bottom's dropped out of my life and i've got a week to brace for the impact .
i'm sorry , tony .
that's exactly what i am doing .
i don't understand .
how come it took you guys two years to tell me this?
lewis never mentioned the two of you .
not when he was convicted two years ago , not when he was sentenced to death .
it was only last week when his final pardon appeal was rejected .
i found a detective , the second he found you , here i am .
you gotta understand , this isn'tjust about me , all right?
like anybody , i have a lot of responsibilities .
i'm engaged .
i have a fiance .
i want to start a family .
family's wonderful .
lewis would like to have kids too .
if you can postpone having yours for a few years , he'll have that chance .
i'm staying at the stanhope .
could you call me there tonight?
all right .
i will .
thanks .
thanks , tony .
this is beth .
miss eastern?
hi .
it's tony croft .
tony , hi .
listen .
kerrie and i talked this over and we want to , um ...
well , first of all i wanna say ... this is ridiculous .
there is no way in hell that i'll do the six years .
but if sheriff agrees to go back ...
um ... well , that's another ...
uh ...
in that case , um ... you know , it'd be pretty hard to say no .
uh ...
ok .
what you've said has been very clear .
i'm about to have dinner with sheriff .
i'll call you in the morning .
all right .
i'll talk to you then .
thank you , tony .
good night .
hey .
hi .
surprised i showed?
no .
why?
cos i am .
eastern party?
yeah .
right this way .
thanks .
would you care for a cocktail?
glass of house red .
ok .
i'll have a rum and coke , please .
thank you .
reminds me of malaysia .
rum and coke .
so have you spoken to tony?
yes , i did .
yeah?
mm hm .
tony said he was going to go back .
yeah?
tony said he was going to call me when he got back from penang .
so ...
so what are you saying?
i can't count on tony's word?
no , i'm not saying that .
just , uh ...
i think it's good tony says he's going back .
how come?
because i'm ...
excuse me .
your drinks .
thanks .
thanks a lot .
tony's only going back if you're going back .
you didn't say that .
i didn't finish .
ok , please finish then , beth .
finish what you were going to say .
i don't expect you to do this without some sort of compensation .
both of lewis's parents have passed on .
they left a little something .
how does $50, 000 sound? $50, 000?
that sounds fine .
just fine .
but for each year . $50, 000 a year .
you want me to pay you $150, 000 for assuming what is , in fact , your share of the responsibility?
no , not you .
lewis's estate .
i mean , they got the heavy money , right?
you come to new york on what was pretty much a fishing expedition .
you stay on the park , eat here , not some coffee shop .
all right .
so i will draw up the draft agreement tomorrow .
if you promise me right now that you're going to go back .
you know what's funny to me?
really funny?
people like you think you can just buy people like me .
but guess what .
i wouldn't walk into your shit storm for any price .
any chance there might have been that i'd go back went bye bye when you tried to pay me off .
menus?
i'm sorry .
there's been a mistake .
i wouldn't want you to buy me dinner .
because then i would be exploiting you .
good night .
i'm sorry .
i didn't mean to insult you .
you insulted yourself .
you made your play .
we're finished .
i would make any play to save lewis's life .
i know you care about that .
don't let my nickname fool you .
it's a bastardisation of my name , volgecherev .
i keep my mouth shut and my head down .
but i do wish lewis luck .
i appreciate your concern for his wellbeing .
but i am persistent .
that's great .
don't waste it on me .
you've only got a few days left .
you're appealing to emotions i don't have and morality i can't afford .
that doesn't change the fact that a man's life hangs in the balance .
good night .
how're you doin ', man?
what's up , sheriff?
how're you doin ', tony?
yep .
here we are .
look , i'm freezing .
yeah .
my secretary's out today .
i apologise for the inconvenience .
you'll have to seat yourself .
so this is the office , huh?
let's just sort this out without that lawyer breathing down our necks .
she's pretty intense , huh?
no shit , man .
after she ambushed me , i couldn't eat for two days .
my girlfriend forced some toast down my throat this morning .
i threw it up .
that's kind of a dry run for our next three years in penang prison .
so you're gonna do this?
you're going back?
no .
you don't give a shit , do you?
you think i don't care about lewis?
that's what you're acting like .
you don't know the first thing about me .
fine .
all right .
then how come you're so ready to slam the door on him?
i know something about guys who have clubs and badges .
i've had my ass kicked by those bastards .
it's not how you think .
doing something good doesn't mean there'll be a happy ending .
you could very easily die over there .
yeah .
you think of that?
this is the other side of the coin .
if this goes down , god forbid , and lewis hangs , you don't think this is gonna be headline news?
sheriff , this is gonna follow you around the rest of your life .
whereas the other way we come home heroes and the city throws us a parade?
tony , you're a fucking boy scout .
you really are .
listen to me , ok?
lewis would have gone back for either of us .
you know that .
that's why i'll never be mistaken for lewis mcbride .
afternoon , miss eastern .
thank you .
beth eastern?
hi .
i'm mj major , a reporter for the new york examiner .
you're a what?
a reporter .
really?
and what would you want with me?
come on , beth .
i know the hanging's in less than a week .
press is exactly what you and the family need for a public outcry .
the family wants this kept quiet .
really?
in this instance , your interests and the interests of the public converge .
how did you find out about this?
my sources at the state department .
there's a blackout at the state department .
they passed the buck .
they sold it as diplomacy .
that's why you need me , and fast .
i can make this happen fast .
in 48 hours , lewis mcbride can be ...
no .
listen to me .
do you remember singapore?
the american kid who graffitied a car?
because of the media frenzy , they had to cane the kid .
that was a caning .
to show some national backbone .
this is a hanging .
i know that .
some aussie dope dealer's mother went on every talk show from sydney to london .
you know what happened?
they hung her son a week early to shut her up .
excuse me , i've got a really big week .
beth , i can make miracles happen in a week .
don't do this .
don't do it .
wait a minute .
why ...
what?
jesus christ !
i'm sorry .
i'm very sorry .
just ...
can i have that , please?
is he boyish?
what?
is he cute?
is he clean cut?
cos if i put him on the front page ...
give me some time .
give me some time , some space , and i'll give you your story .
when?
soon .
i'm gonna call you , beth .
what are you doing here?
i have a tape i want you to watch .
yeah?
jesus christ , you don't let up , do you?
i can't .
you know what?
i'm gonna watch this .
honest to god i am .
but i was actually gonna go get something to eat .
so i'll watch it later .
are you inviting me to dinner , or are we still mad at each other?
both .
cheers .
cheers .
it's a toast to lewis .
sweet guy .
loved the animals .
loved his beer .
did he?
he did .
i never knew that about him .
tell me something else .
beer is all i really remember .
that's it?
yeah .
wow .
he didn't leave an impression then .
lewis?
are you kidding me?
have you spent a lot of time with him?
i've never had a beer with him .
he is , honestly , beth , one of the sweetest people i've ever met .
lewis is the kind of guy ...
you'd have a beggar on the street , and he'd just ... he'd touch them somehow , talk to them .
the guy could have an illness , language barrier , whatever it was .
he just could see people , i guess .
got a big heart .
yeah .
that's nice .
what else can you tell me about him?
you are good , aren't you?
oh , sheriff , what do you think about me?
i don't know .
you seem to think i have all these wiles and stratagems .
i don't .
i have a man's life in my hands .
i get that .
but let me ask you a question , beth .
and ask yourself this honestly .
would you go back?
i wouldn't ask you or tony to do this if i hadn't already answered the question for myself .
yeah .
but i guess , you know , i don't think you could ever honestly answer that unless you were in that situation yourself .
hi , gaby .
i'm not a piece of dirt you get off on then flush down the john , all right?
he'll fuck you and then sneak out , by the fire escape if he has to .
unless you don't give a shit .
unless you're some whore .
i'm his wife .
what?
fuck you for not wearing a ring .
that's my friend gaby .
wow .
good thing you didn't give her a social disease .
we'd all be dead .
thanks , frank .
i appreciate it .
so when did you guys tie the knot?
you know what , frank?
get the hell outta here , will you?
ok?
yeah .
well , that was fun .
that was something .
i'm his wife . " i like that one .
i'm his wife .
thanks .
you left this on the table .
please watch it .
i will , beth .
i will .
good night .
ok .
ok , lewis , go ahead .
um ...
hey , guys .
sheriff .
tony .
long time , huh?
i guess if you're seeing this tape you've kind of figured that my vacation plans ... changed .
i was set to go off and try and save the orang utan , do what i can .
kind of ironic , isn't it?
look who's caged and ... they say soon to be extinct .
um ... this little docudrama here was not my idea .
i'm sorry , but , um ... the folks at the american citizen service have done all they can and now they tell me that you guys are my last chance .
so ...
i don't know if you're even thinking about coming back .
but if there's the slightest chance , i will tell you this .
um ...
i haven't been . uh ... harmed in any way .
i haven't been tortured ... except by boredom and hunger .
there's not a whole lot of good stuff to eat .
no burgers for you , sheriff .
but , uh ...
there's rice .
plenty of rice .
your rice needs definitely will be met .
but , um ...
if you do ...
if you do come back ,
i will feel guilty , yes , and ...
i already do , just for asking you .
but ... at least i won't feel the fear , and i know that's not fair .
um ... so that's why i'm doing this .
hey !
i'm busy !
can't take you today .
yeah , well , i can't take you either .
pop , remember that trip i took a couple of years back , to malaysia?
yeah , i remember .
some sleaze was selling frequent flyer miles , right?
that's not the point .
the point is this guy is still over there in penang .
he's kind of a pal .
but anyway , they're gonna hang him .
they found some hashish on him .
but some of the hash was mine .
so if i go back there ,
i'd have to serve three years in prison , penang prison .
but if i don't go back , they hang this guy .
they don't hang guys for hashish .
i'm not that naive .
you're leaving something out .
i'm not leaving anything out , dad .
that's the way it is over there .
all right .
so maybe you're right and i'm wrong .
you still want my advice in this hanging stuff?
yeah .
it feels like an easy call .
if you weren't wasting your life here , it might be different .
but this pal you'll save , odds are he's worth more than you .
so my advice , you go , you do the time .
what's the matter?
you look sick .
you're my dad .
you're supposed to beg me not to go back .
it's just not what i expected to hear , i guess .
lighten up .
i'm just yanking your crank .
why put yourself through the agony when you know you're not going?
i mean , who's kidding who?
what are we , suckers here?
no , they did what?
they weighed him?
for what?
jesus .
uh ... [ phone rings ]
uh ...
i ...
i have to get my other ...
i have to get the call .
um ...
it might be one of the guys .
we'll talk tomorrow?
um ...
this ... this is beth .
beth , hi .
you sound stressed .
this is mj major .
is this a bad time?
no .
no , it's not a bad time .
beth , what's wrong?
how can i help?
you know ...
you want to know how you can help?
just leave me alone , mj .
just leave me alone .
i've got the resources to a daily paper with worldwide readership .
we are picked up by the international herald trib .
we could be doing anything you want .
photographs , articles , petitions ...
every single one a death warrant , mj .
a death warrant .
now , i've asked you nicely to stay out of this until after the hearing .
if i don't get something from you soon , i'll go straight to your two guys .
you don't know who they are , or you'd already be there .
i'm hanging up .
beth , i'm gonna need to hear from you very soon .
you will .
sheriff .
well , hi .
i didn't expect to see you .
come on in .
thanks .
how are you doing?
couldn't be better .
yeah?
please give me some good news .
are you , um ...
did you get my message about dinner?
yeah , i got your message but i can't make dinner .
i got plans .
but i did want to return this to you .
the tape .
uh ...
ok .
did you watch it?
yeah , i watched the whole thing .
and , um ...
i did a lot of soul searching last night with this .
and i figure you've got to know sooner than later because of everything .
i just wanted to come and let you know where you stand with me .
that's good .
where do i stand with you?
i talked to tony and he said ...
he's halfway to penang already .
i think he just needs a nudge .
i think he'll probably go back .
but , um ...
you know , i looked inside , deep inside , beth , to find something , but , uh ... it isn't in me .
oh , it isn't ... in you .
jot that down .
do me a favour?
write that down for me .
just a few words .
i'd love to give them to lew before he hangs .
letter from a pal .
listen , i ... " searched my soul " was the best part for me .
i don't know .
that's great .
he'd love to know that you searched your soul before you decided not to go .
yeah .
they just told me that they weighed lewis today for the trap doors of the gallows .
beth ...
get out of here .
get the fuck out of here , sheriff .
sheriff is here .
what do you say?
how're you doing?
i thought you had plans .
i did .
a thing at lincoln center .
you know what i mean?
but here i am .
ready to discuss .
what did i order?
sheriff , this is kerrie , my fiance .
kerrie , john volgecherev .
kerrie , nice to meet you .
you're not as platinum as i expected you to be .
listen , sheriff ...
it's pretty obvious that you have no intention of going back , right?
where?
is he drunk?
oh , you mean , like , back to prison .
right , well , i've never actually been .
do you have a fork i could use?
i've never been to prison , thus , i can't go back to somewhere i've never been .
thank you .
that is brilliantly unhelpful .
yes .
beth , i checked .
penang prison is at a third world level of sanitation , nutrition , rice rations don't meet minimum ...
lewis is provided with food from amnesty international .
so would tony be .
inmates have been tortured .
he hasn't been .
inmates have died of typhus .
because of overcrowding .
lewis has his own cell , as would tony , and sheriff if he goes back .
that's really good .
and the other thing i think you've overlooked is that that building's not up to code .
oh , jesus .
what are you , the class clown?
and who are you to tell them to give up their freedom?
i represent a boy sentenced to death .
right .
for the sake of some client , you demand ...
demand?
no , no , no .
i don't demand .
i have not demanded anything . ... that they endure three or six years of god knows what .
that's insane .
yeah , it's insane , ok?
i'm gonna go back .
what?
ok?
i'm sorry , honey .
in the middle of this , what matters?
that lewis doesn't die .
somebody's got to do something .
please .
where's the document that guarantees this deal?
the attorney general of malaysia has agreed ...
so where is it?
why don't we have a copy?
it's an oral agreement .
no .
tony goes nowhere till we have that document .
they don't work that way .
i wish they did .
i cannot get anything to you in writing .
don't .
i'll be at home if you want me .
sorry , tony .
i'm sorry .
she's just scared , all right?
she's more scared than i am .
you're gonna have to excuse me .
if i'm gonna get her to wait three years for me ...
i guess six ...
i shouldn't keep her waiting tonight .
tony , what can i say?
thank you .
sure .
all right , tony .
see you , man .
see you later .
good luck with that .
right , sheriff .
i'll go talk to the firm .
well , quite a party .
are you gonna go back to your hotel?
oh , yes .
gotta call penang .
give them the good news .
so i guess lew's gonna be ok then , huh?
which means , you know ...
you're off the hook?
i'm off the hook , huh?
good night .
jaffe , i want a follow up on the canarsie fire .
nice of you to join us , ravitch .
it's my pleasure .
i'd like some pictures of the shopkeeper , burnt out .
you got it .
mj , where's my pension fund fraud?
i thought you had a cpa who was ready to talk .
i did .
and she's given me gold .
i'm just fact checking a few points .
and i'm looking for a source called sheriff .
ring anybody's bell?
sheriff?
ok .
let's go , then .
yeah?
hi .
it's beth .
i talked to the garage and they said you called in sick .
can i come up and see you?
uh ... sure .
hi .
hi there .
hi there .
i brought some goodies from zabar's .
jewish penicillin .
cure you right up .
isn't that nice?
should i beware of lawyers bearing gifts?
think i'm gonna have a beer .
do you want one?
uh ... beer?
sure .
you're quite the avid reader , aren't you?
or is this just ...
yeah , just for showing off .
all the visitors i have .
i keep my place real impressive , don't i?
it's nice .
the books are a recent development .
when i was in school , i tried to avoid reading .
then i graduate and realise i don't know shit .
yeah .
who does?
you know what i mean?
so anyway , i start getting the books and ... do some reading , learn about the world around me .
just trying to be civilised i guess , beth .
that's good .
lewis said you were better than you thought you were .
a lot of them are pop up books .
colouring .
that kind of thing .
where's your passport?
what?
i just want to see your passport .
in case it's not good .
i can renew it tomorrow on an emergency basis if you decide something different .
so when you said about me being off the hook , you were just lying to my face?
i think you were lying to yourself .
come on , sheriff .
only a total bastard would let tony go back alone .
yeah , well , i'm not in charge of tony .
i'm not his dad .
i know that .
but tony's a man who's got ...
tony's a great guy .
but he's got a future and a sexy fiance .
yeah .
six years under any circumstances would be hard as hell , but this case , it's inconceivable .
i think tony's a man of his word .
tony called me three days ago and told me that he couldn't do six years .
i know what he said last night .
i applaud his idealism .
but ...
i can't count on it .
i have to have you on that plane , sheriff .
please show me your passport .
no that it's any of your business , but my passport's good .
it is?
show it to me .
take my word for it .
show it to me .
you'd take three years from me but you wouldn't take my word?
ok .
all right .
i pushed it .
i'm sorry .
i trust you .
you know what?
come on .
you're gonna go for me if you don't have a client?
what are you talking about?
wh ...
what?
you offer me money and i don't take that so you figure , " why don't i fuck the guy cos then he'll do what i want .
that's exactly me .
that's actually exactly me .
i'll get you to go back because i'll give you a little sex .
that's me .
go fuck yourself .
whoo !
that's fun .
i'm the guy who's gotta clean up .
that's fun .
have fun , sheriff .
shut up !
you're too noisy !
you fucking crazy bastard !
shut up !
you're making too much goddamn noise !
open the door !
open the door , you fucking pussy !
open the fucking door !
open your fucking door !
sheriff , that's enough !
i'm calling the cops .
sheriff .
turnabout's fair game , huh?
now that you're news , all's fair .
you son of a bitch !

i'll bust your fucking face open !
i'm doing my job , man .
i'm doing my job !
i'm doing my job !
get the fuck outta my face .
i'll sue your ass .
sheriff !
sheriff , can i talk to you for one second?
please?
is that your photographer?
is that sheriff?
are you gonna print pictures now?
this story is about to blow wide open , ok?
i found this story first , i'm gonna print it first , period .
your story could cost lewis's life .
do you understand that?
you give me three days three days until the hearing is over , ok?
you promise me that you will not talk to a soul and that i have lewis exclusively .
exclusive .
you promise me you're gonna hold off on the story .
three days , beth .
slow down , driver .
you're making me nervous .
i'm sorry , sir .
it's a bad habit i got .
i was all mellowed out but you fucked that up .
i hope you're not gonna say i can't smoke .
it's the only place left in town you can smoke .
what the fuck are you doing?
smoking crack?
crack is for our african american brethren .
this is pure rock cocaine .
if you don't like it , driver , you can raise the partition .
i can?
whatever you want to do .
you want to see what i want to do?
huh?
cocksucker .
what do you want?
i want to see you .
ok .
what's happening here , beth?
you tell me , sheriff .
i'm not sure but i know that i just ...
i can't take this any more .
so don't take it .
what do you want?
oh , my god .
you're killing me , beth .
i'm killing you?
you're killing me .
sheriff?
oh , shit .
sheriff , are you there?
i was just gonna say that i hope that , um ... you don't think last night was about ...
um ... could you call me when you get this message?
that'd be good .
all right .
can i sit next to you on the plane?
hi , tony .
tony?
hm?
you all right?
yeah .
yeah , i'm fine .
sure?
do you wanna , um ...
do you want to switch with us?
yeah , do you want to switch seats?
no , i like my seat .
it's fine .
sheriff , i'm a big boy .
i don't need somebody to hold my hand .
ok .
all right .
at least until we get over the philippines .
come on , move it , man !
let's go !
whoo !
look out !
woo hoo !
yes !
maybe we should all wash up , meet in a half hour or so .
fine with me .
is that cool with everyone?
yeah , it's fine .
i'm right here .
all right , man .
hi .
sheriff ...
what's the matter?
what's wrong?
um ...
what?
i'm gonna miss you .
i'm gonna miss you .
they won't bend .
only one visitor allowed in there .
one at a time?
no , only one today .
oh , great .
what do you want to do?
do you mind if i go back there and see him?
no .
no , you go .
are you sure?
go ahead .
tell him i'll see him soon .
ok .
can you come back here?
i hear you .
lew?
lewis?
sheriff?
yeah .
didn't they tell you i was coming?
i was praying .
i thought you were a dream cos no prayer of mine's ever been answered here before .
yeah?
i sure as hell ain't a dream .
i'll tell you that .
it's good to see you .
it's good to see you .
you too !
how are you , man?
i'm better now .
that's good .
that's good .
how are you?
i'm all right , man .
you look good .
nice .
nice .
spiff on .
you've come so far .
are you thirsty?
do you want some tea?
i can make some tea .
all right .
yeah .
let's have some tea .
it's not warm or anything but ...
it's ok .
you're not cold , are you?
nah , i'm not cold .
no?
tony is here to see you too .
he's outside .
you see , they took away my blanket .
why did they take your blanket away?
cos they were scared that i was gonna tear it into strips to hang myself .
i said , " hey , guys , what do you think i'm paying you for?
thank you , man .
that's good tea .
i know why tony didn't come in here .
i know .
cos there's no god in here .
they only let one visitor in at a time .
that's why i pray now , sheriff .
i ...
cos ...
out there there's no need to ... to pray where where where god's hand is felt .
you know?
where god is apparent?
but in here there's definitely a need to to pray , t t t to beg , to plead , to sing for ... for a sign like ...
you know how ...
you know how ... how your voice sounds so pretty in the shower?
because ... because there's nothing else there .
because it echoes off the walls and it sounds so pretty .
that's why prayer sounds so perfect in here .
because it's so ...
because it's so totally empty .
because it's so ... it's so godless .
it's ...
it's so void of ... of anything .
and do you know how i know , sheriff?
do you know how i know?
i know because ... because i ...
i ask myself ... would i come back for you?
and the only answer is a godless empty evil " no .
i'm sorry i wouldn't have come back !
i'm sorry .
don't be .
it's ok .
because i didn't come back just for you .
i didn't come back just for you , you know?
it's all right .
man , it's ok .
do you know what i mean?
come here .
it's ok .
ok , man .
ok .
i'm gonna see you in a couple hours , all right?
all right?
thanks for the tea .
i liked that .
see you in a couple of hours .
you'll be cleaned up .
it'll be good .
sheriff .
yeah?
i knew you'd come back .
even if you didn't .
thank you .
so how bad was it?
i don't know .
i don't know how bad it was .
it was not good .
what wasn't good , the prison or lewis?
the prison sucks , for sure .
it's dirty , it's scary , it's third world .
how's lewis?
is he sick?
is he all there mentally?
is he the same guy we used to know?
i don't think he's lost his mind , but it's not easy sitting around a cell waiting to hang .
yeah .
what did he say?
did he tell you anything?
he just babbled a little bit , tone .
you know , like , rambled a little bit , you know?
like stream of consciousness stuff .
god's not in here .
there's no god in here .
the sound's beautiful , like singing in the shower .
basically you're saying he lost it .
he's hanging onto anything he possibly can .
no one's questioning his courage .
but his sanity?
you want a way out?
find one .
but lewis has always talked that way .
how do ...
what do you mean , always?
you're only his lawyer .
you've known him for two years .
24 years .
i'm his sister .
what?
he's my baby brother .
why didn't you tell me?
i thought you wouldn't trust me , sheriff .
i thought you'd think i'd do anything , that i'd say ... say anything , that i'd sell you out , that i'd ...
i wanted to ...
i wanted to tell you .
i tried to tell you .
but you didn't tell me .
but you didn't tell me .
sheriff?
what are we still doing here?
i wish it was that simple , tony .
i think it's that simple .
i came back here based on what she told me , ok , and she gave me her word and she lied .
how are we going to trust her , sheriff?
she drags us into this nightmare , we find out it is her personal nightmare .
a woman we don't know from adam .
i don't know her .
you don't know her .
what?
i know her .
like , know her .
don't even ...
don't .
fuck .
all right , i'm an asshole .
no , tony .
this time i'm the fucking asshole .
why didn't you tell me?
what do i owe you to tell you that?
it's not like it's been going on forever .
it happened .
listen to me ...
don't make it like i'm holding out on you because i swear to god i'm not .
all right .
listen to me , sheriff .
this girl will do anything to get you to do what she needs you to , all right?
that's her brother in there .
her blood .
she'll lie to you , she'll sleep with you , she'll tell you she loves you .
she'll do anything .
she'll get down on her knees and beg you .
but don't believe it .
it's a setup .
if we walk out of here , that boy hangs .
and if we stay maybe we hang .
but if we leave , we live .
that's the one thing i know for sure right now .
he doesn't have clothes?
can't you give him a shower before he turns up in court?
ok .
listen .
i ...
what can i do for you , sir?
we need two seats on any flight to new york , as fast as possible .
what , sheriff?
what is it?
i trashed that bike , tony .
so fucking what?
get on the plane , sheriff .
do you want to rot in one of these prisons?
i'm gonna take my chances , tony .
you don't have any chances , sheriff .
don't leave your life to fate .
this is stupid .
i don't know , tony .
you have a safe flight .
what's he saying?
he says they returned but became frightened and may have left .
we request adjournment till the two can be found .
um ... he's worried about the appearance of preferential treatment .
hey , lew .
how are you?
my faith in humanity is half restored .
in returning voluntarily , you are to be commended for your courage .
is there anything you wish to say to this court , mr volgecherev?
not really , your honour .
just that we were young and stupid , i guess .
but not evil .
i didn't come back here today because i'm courageous .
i came back here because i've been careless for a very long time , and i'm sick of that feeling .
the simple fact , your honour , is that i am responsible .
and i'm also scared .
but i am willing to do whatever is necessary ... in order for you to spare my friend's life .
how do you plead?
i'm guilty .
you will be detained in penang prison to await sentence .
he asked the prosecutor if he will now reduce the charges .
the prosecutor has agreed .
chief justice will be back shortly with his decision .
beth?
we're back in session .
we're back?
yeah .
the deputy home minister is angered about some international news story .
i'm not sure what .
a story that was picked up by the asian international tribune .
in a country proud of its many species of exotic butterflies , a butterfly is about to be broken on a wheel .
the wheel is malaysian justice , a term which strikes one american woman as a cruel joke .
your honour ...
" the woman is beth mcbride ...
i didn't do this . " ... whose brother was arrested two years ago in penang .
blamed for having bought hashish with two friends , this nature loving young man now , incredibly , faces death .
she was determined to write the story .
silence !
we know you westerners don't understand our attitude toward drugs .
but we don't understand yours .
your cities are decaying , the souls of your young people are stolen from you .
our laws may seem harsh but our streets remain safe and our youth is protected .
so when an american journalist criticises ourjudicial system ...
your honour , i begged her not to .
silence !
lewis mcbride ... [ continues in malay ]
what is he saying?
what is he saying?
he will not amend the charge now .
lewis must be hanged tomorrow .
what?
lewis !
your honour , i came back here .
you can't hang him !
you hang on , lewis !
beth , i love you !
get your fucking hands off me .
what is the matter with you people?
what is the matter with you people?
you are gonna go straight to hell , you motherfucker !
you lying son of a bitch !
goddamn it !
sheriff !
i don't wanna die !
no !
you fucking bastards !
i don't wanna die !
help !
lewis .
lewis !
lewis !
please let go of me !
you fucking bastards !
no !
no !
lew !
lewis !
lewis !
lewis !
lewis , goddamn it !
look up here !
sheriff !
i'm here , lewis !
i'm right here !
you're not alone , lewis !
look at me , lewis !
you're not alone , lewis .
look at me .
you're not alone .
i'm here .
look at me .
see me , lewis .
you're not alone .
i'm right here .
i'm right here , lewis .
i see you , lewis .
i'm right here .
lewis , you are not alone right now .
i'm right here .
you are not alone , lewis .
i see you .
i see you , lewis .
i'm here .
you're not alone .
you are not alone , lewis !
right .
ok .
where am i going here?
beth .
were you there?
yeah .
he wasn't afraid , beth .
he walked right past me .
and then i saw him go past all the guards and he was calm .
come on , sheriff .
tell me the truth .
it was hard .
it was hard .
but , uh ...
you know , i think that , uh ... he found , at the end , beth , at the end ...
i mean , he was lewis , you know?
at that last second ,
i swear to god , he was at peace with everything .
he was .
i just wish i could have done something .
if i could have been there to do something .
fight harder .
you did everything you could .
nobody could have done more .
you've gotta believe that .
nobody did more than you did .
nobody could have done more .
you did everything you could .
you should have gone back with tony .
why didn't you go back with tony?
i couldn't go back with tony .
i couldn't go back because i knew that you were waiting for me .
and i'm not sorry , beth .
i'm not sorry right now .
i'm not .
cos if i would have went back ,
i don't think i'd be able to look at you ever again .
and that'd be a lot harder than this shit .
you know what i mean?
i like to look at you .
i like to look at you .
i like to look at you .
the ambassador heard through back channels that when all this publicity dies down , they're gonna let you go , sheriff .
they're gonna do it quietly to save face , but it's gonna be six months , maximum .
sheriff?
yeah .
oh , goddamn it !
oh , goddamn it !
sheriff .
i am gonna take my brother home ... and i'm coming right back here .
and i will not leave penang until you're with me .
i know , beth .
i know .
