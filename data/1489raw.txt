same guns , same o4 explosives , same planning .
it's them again .
look around .
you won't find much , but go ahead .
the headless man says hi !
blown away by a mercury bullet .
eve verhagen , oou .
eddy valence , brl .
yeah , i can read .
where do you hail from?
suburban narcotics squad .
sick of smashing syringes?
you could say that .
klein is sulking , stay with him .
don't chat with the enemy .
we're enemies?
brl/ oou , it's an old rivalry .
aren't we a big family?
so they say .
she's private property .
klein's?
who else?
how could you be pals with him?
he wasn't always like this .
their names?
winterstein .
bruno and rolf .
the one who did me was bruno .
your big mouth will get you in trouble .
now it has .
7 vans in 18 months 9 conveyors slaughtered , and a 2 million euro booty .
the ministry of the lnterior sent us a memo .
asking us , and i quote : " to tackle the problem head on
and neutralize the criminals
who've derided our forces for too long .
too long " is bad !
means we've been around for too long , doing nothing !
as of today you're on duty 24 hours a day !
drop your personal problems , don't laze on sundays , go out and nab that gang of fuckers before they strike for the 8th time !
you got that?
got that ,
oapt .
kechichian?
we were up late .
for a good cause .
sure , loitering in a bar at 2 am , after defacing the wall of a government building , how can i fault you for being so admirable !
anything else?
a lead on the van jobs .
victor dragan .
we got a tip off from an informant .
a reliable source?
not at all .
what do you say?
i know the fellow .
a sadistic loner .
barring a lucky break , he'll be tough to nail .
luck can be engineered .
briefing's over !
vrinks , you stay .
i've been appointed police oommissioner .
as of when?
l take over on sept 1 .
oongratulations .
i hate to leave before i've cleaned house .
i want that gang , leo .
as my farewell gift .
you'll get them .
another thing : someone will get my desk .
you're the right man .
klein wants to be ohief .
he wants power , that's different .
but you both qualify : same rank , seniority , service rating .
so whoever nails that scum , will be king .
i don't mix with brass .
it's better than mixing with whores and hoods .
times have changed .
get yourself a new style .
you're an anomaly .
your men , your methods .
ln the police , now you toe the line , you snap to .
lf you don't , no one will cover for you .
all the brass have caved in .
even you?
lay off me , shit !
who the fuck are you?
shit , what ya doin '?
who the fuck are you?
what have i done?
don't do that , don't !
lay off manou , or i'll stuff you with your brother's head .
quite a shiv !
war booty .
oreep's gotta hitchhike buck naked , and cuffed !
we shoulda wasted him !
gotta be ten grand !
a year's pay for a flatfoot .
those fuckers !
for our slush fund?
no , it's for manou .
leo .
oome in .
hi , ohristo .
manou's resting in her room .
i'll tell her you're here .
let her rest .
she ok?
just ok .
still after that van gang?
still am .
i hear they hit again .
near the beltway , right?
my only advice is : when you bust 'em , shoot first !
you know anything?
i'm not a snitch .
ask your questions elsewhere .
who worked over manou?
what do you mean?
leo ...
l'm 46 , i spent 18 years in jail .
she's the best thing that happened to me .
someone hurt her , i gotta know .
lf i tell you , what'll you do?
that's up to me .
you're in trouble any time you step out of here !
you're a hood , ohristo .
with a record for armed robbery .
lf you smack your neighbor over a trifle , you go back to jail !
manou needs you : if you go down , so does she .
screw your cop morality .
anyway , it's settled .
i dealt with it .
this is to make amends .
around 7 grand .
i'll see you out .
thanks , leo .
i won't forget .
the guy you're looking for , dragan .
i know where he is .
at a chick's place on borrego st.
don't ask how i know .
police !
freeze !
stay there !
get up !
let me hug my kid .
your wrists !
sign there .
have a nice leave , silien .
your puch's in the toolbox .
with a 2nd clip , just in case .
this is dumb , silien .
you got 3 weeks to do .
watch the road .
neat vodka .
you kept dragan to yourself .
was that wrong?
don't they say , it takes two to tango?
we're not dancing anymore .
anyway , he was a bum lead .
how do you know?
i know .
that's all .
silien here .
how are you , captain?
am i intruding?
sure , it's after midnight .
where are you?
ln a hotel .
i'm out till tomorrow night .
on a leave .
wasn't a jailbreak .
l gotta see you fast .
tonight , i can't .
you'll regret it .
meet me in 1 hr at " swann's " .
same again?
no , thanks .
oamille ok?
she's fine .
when did you buy this?
we'll talk cars later .
what's up?
nice welcome !
you haven't seen me in 4 years .
don't i rate a smile?
this is a favor for a pal inside .
you made me cross paris for a lousy scam?
i got a hot tip .
you're a piece of shit .
what is it?
heavy duty stuff .
real hot tip .
want it or not?
what's the deal?
just stay with me .
ln a half hour , it's done .
here he is .
stay in the car !
get going !
stop it !
why'd you screw me?
stop it !
stop , dammit !
i know who the van gang are .
and their next stunt .
they're in the sticks .
it starts from there .
ln exchange , you cover me .
or get nailed with me .
who did you waste?
marcus zerbib , his driver and his goon .
marcus zerbib?
the guy who put you in jail?
you'll get nabbed right away !
not with a good alibi .
now ... you can grab the worst gang around .
ohoose .
ok , let's have it .
francis horn and robert boulanger .
they're squatting in st ouen .
on oaptain glarner st.
don't you say hi?
i hadn't seen you .
want a drink?
i'm with friends .
you got friends now?
your only friend is me .
lf i conk out , you're dead .
here's my direct line , so you can't forget it .
give me a lead , fast .
that gang ...
i want their names first .
nobody knows them , i swear !
i want news from you .
stay in touch .
so i know you're ok .
good seeing you again .
how'd you get that?
it's nothing .
at work .
why not tell me what you do?
i don't want to lose you .
you get home late , leave early .
lots of cops live that way .
many wind up all alone .
what are you after?
nothing .
i just do my job .
get up , lazybones !
morning , dad " .
morning , dad .
and give him a kiss .
no school today?
never on wednesday .
you know that .
yeah , if i knew it's wednesday .
mom in?
rushing as usual .
thanks for the ... coffee !
my ass is spreading , that's bad .
i don't mind , i love big asses .
know what my big ass says to you?
that it misses me .
sunday's my dad's 70th birthday .
he hopes we'll come .
there'll be a crowd .
you don't have to talk .
what crowd?
my mom's family .
uncles , aunts , cousins coming from rome .
we'll see .
lola , hurry !
bye , daddy o .
bye , honey .
6 slugs were fired .
2 hit the driver , 1 the goon , 3 zerbib .
no one saw much .
the building's all oldies .
by the time they shuffled to a window , it was all over .
but the concierge saw a girl get out of the merc and run away .
brunette , red coat , a bj artist .
zerbib liked cheap whores .
we'll find her .
that's for homicide , not us .
you knew him well?
enough to want to nab his killer .
vrinks , brl .
the names horn and boulanger .
give me all you've got .
what's with the zerbib case?
he was getting a bj in the car .
had his dong out and his pants down .
a concierge saw the girl leave after the shooting .
she see anything else?
ask homicide , it's their baby .
oan i see the telex?
boulanger .
i got several , which do you want?
robert .
francis horn and robert boulanger , aka bob .
horn : armed robbery record .
wanted for theft , armed robbery , extortion and attempted murder .
weapons freak , ex mercenary , trained in syria , a real psycho .
boulanger broke from jail 2 years ago , killing a guard and an officer .
seems horn sprung boulanger to have him on his team .
i have no other names , but they operate from here , a squat beside a warehouse by the beltway .
first , we find lookouts and set up surveillance teams .
smao and titi will be in the silo overlooking the squat .
you photograph everyone coming and going .
you identify all vehicles , and any lowlifes in the area .
second , we cordon off the area , block escape routes , one team per street in a perimeter of half a mile within the area .
third , we advise the local police we'll be playing on their turf for a few days , and to lie low on the day we make the grab .
no neighborhood investigations or questioning , we avoid concierges , storekeepers , local hangouts .
klein , oou .
you don't know me , i know you .
no waves : we settle in , watch and wait .
know what they'll hit?
no .
we can't lose them .
let's go .
wear bulletproof vests over your t shirts .
we have a common friend , a friend who just died .
marcus zerbib , you know him?
he wasn't a friend .
you two were in business .
some nasty gossips say he snitched on you 4 years ago .
the guys he snitched on would fill the phone book .
but only you could gun him down in cold blood , during a leave from jail .
would i waste him when i have 2 weeks left to do?
what's wrong , leo?
nothing , why?
don't kid me .
you're lost , i can tell .
i'm in deep shit , and i can't discuss it .
not even with me?
not even with you .
where were you that night?
with a cop .
hq's finest cop .
we met at " swann's " at 1 am , we chewed the fat till 5 am , then he dropped me at my hotel .
ok?
his name?
vrinks .
i'll need your boys .
what for?
we located the van gang .
how'd you get the tip?
know a man called silien?
why?
says he was with you when zerbib died .
lf he says so , must be true .
oould i have that in writing?
lnvestigating murders now?
when my snitches get killed .
those fuckers give me a giant hard on .
some get laid , others freeze !
we're on the wrong team .
no , that's his last fuck .
we'll hump again .
you sure?
big luc to fat ass .
mercedes wagon , local plates , 4 men on board .
lt's headed your way .
long haired guy is frank ohenaf .
l nabbed him for a holdup 10 years ago .
a mean fucker .
i don't know the others .
sad and jamel attia .
i say it's for tomorrow .
nabbing 'em in the act's dumb .
they'll fire at us .
we may lose them to avoid bloodshed .
what do you suggest?
we hit 'em at night , and gun down the lot of them .
what about our ethics code?
i've wiped my ass with that for years .
they killed 9 men .
9 families call me every week hoping i'll have good news at last .
i owe it to them .
it obsesses me .
stay home , let vrinks deal with it .
i've worked 2 years on this case .
it's my collar as much as anyone's .
ok , but you'll be back up .
you only move in on vrinks's orders .
he and his men are the front line .
he's in charge of this .
whether you like it or not .
lgor here , they're coming out .
headed for the cars .
gotcha .
big luc here , they're coming out .
two black suv's and a mercedes .
standby .
i'll advise when they move .
seurat ohenaf in the lead car , the attia brothers in the second .
and the rest?
i only see boulanger .
the suv's are off .
they're taking off .
the suv's are leaving .
very slowly .
i see them .
they just passed us .
let 'em leave the area .
guy and bernie tail the suv's .
we tail horn , boulanger , the chick .
we only hit 'em at the warehouse .
l repeat . don't hit 'em here !
the suv's are stopped at the entrance .
horn and the chick are out .
we'll be ok .
armed to the teeth .
where's he going?
eve to dennis .
what's up?
what are the orders?
they're about to leave .
shit , someone's moving !
klein's headed for the squat .
he's alone .
what's he up to?
he's drawn his gun , headed for them .
dennis to leo .
what is this?
what is this?
answer !
oops , behind you .
move in at once !
i said : move in now !
shit , big luc !
they hit me !
grenade !
oome on , bitch !
drop your guns !
drop your gun , pig !
drop your guns , hands on your heads !
hands on your head !
oome along , bitch !
let go of her !
fuck you !
shut up !
drop your gun !
drop your gun .
i'll waste her !
on your knees !
kneel !
that's better !
hands behind your head , scumbag !
lf you tail me , i'll waste the bitch !
don't take her , take me .
you're dead !
stay put !
state police found eve lying on the freeway .
she jumped out of the moving car .
fucker's got some nerve !
big luc , smao ...
what does this mean?
the oommissioner didn't like you and your men's stunt at the funeral .
screw him !
i know .
but i'm warning you .
of what?
top brass are like old maids : you don't ream them .
get your men back in line , drop the petitions , the strike threats , the defaming of klein .
klein goofed , he has to be punished .
that's for lnternal affairs , not you .
an investigation's under way .
lf klein was responsible for this fuck up , it'll come out .
taking on klein is taking on the hierarchy , which is questioning the system .
you can't do that .
so eddy died in vain?
he died doing his duty .
sorry .
i owe him the truth .
what's that?
requests for transfers .
we all signed .
it's klein or us , you decide .
lt's dennis .
i hear you're testifying against me at the inquiry .
valence's death was fate , pal .
stirring up shit won't bring him back .
you agree?
i'm gonna hang up .
you can't do this to me .
you can't .
this job , is all i have .
so don't crap on me , or you'll regret it !
where is he?
room 24 , 2nd floor .
and the witness?
he split .
he's married and was with a chick , didn't want any heat .
pulling strings is an insult to valence .
i can't , dennis .
some deaths you can't touch .
are you refusing?
no .
as i said , this isn't any old file .
he was a fine cop , the union backs vrinks .
unless we humor them , police hq will be up in arms .
all i can do is try to convince the board not to suspend you .
with your record , it should work .
and if it doesn't?
police !
freeze !
know why i didn't kill you , horn?
death only happens once .
i won't let it surprise you .
you'll wait for it in a cell , like an idiot , until you go nuts from loneliness .
know what?
one day i'll be behind your door !
i'll kill you and your whole family .
i doubt it .
oan i see you a minute?
boulanger's dead .
a freeway roadblock .
he tried to run it .
gift from the oommissioner .
with a letter of congratulations .
to be shared among you .
200 euros .
doesn't cover eddy's wreath .
klein's in front of the board in 2 days .
i know .
let the system handle it .
lf you mess things up , they'll make you pay for it .
where do you stand?
me ...
i've already left .
evening , oaptain .
i hear things are edgy at hq .
it's a problem for cops .
not for you .
that why you wanted to see me?
no , for my girlfriend .
she got busted .
they claim she's hooking and gave it to the aliens office .
she may be expelled and fined .
what do i care?
the zerbib affair interest you?
go on .
he died in her mouth .
fix her case , you never heard of me , she'll tell all .
i'm listening .
there were two men .
one fired , the other waited in the car .
l saw the one in the car today .
where did you see him?
at police hq .
he's a cop .
what do you want?
lssued by judge rousseau , instructions to search your home and take you in for questioning .
you crazy?
you'd better let us in .
go fuck yourself !
you got fucked , vrinks .
search the whole place .
leo , what's happening?
who is this?
it's nothing .
stay with lola .
who's lola?
my daughter .
who are you?
lnternal affairs .
don't worry .
why are they arresting you?
later , oamille .
do what i said .
oamille called .
what did she want?
what do you think?
was leo's arrest your doing?
it wasn't my doing .
he was arrested for being dumb .
i did my job .
yourjob is jailing your friends?
when they cross the line , yes .
you won't fulfill yourself that way .
meaning?
becoming the fine cop you'll never be .
why didn't you tell me?
what for?
we nailed horn and his gang .
the rest is a detail .
lt could jail you for 10 years .
you covered up a murder .
you don't realize .
no .
i got screwed by my informant , not the same .
i owed him for his tip .
you'd have done the same .
i'm not you .
what should i do?
oome clean : don't crap lnternal affairs .
the hooker recognized you and silien .
denial makes you an accomplice .
i gotta snitch on silien?
he put you in deep shit .
tell us where he is .
it's your only chance .
i don't know where he is .
judge rousseau has been assigned to the case .
you know him .
he hates cops , he'll slaughter you .
... olosing a blind eye on 3 murders to protect an informant and arrest a vicious gang is one thing .
that this led to a colleague's death , and the events that ensued , is another .
what is serious , vrinks , is that your silence meant silien was freed .
he's a menace to society .
i won't dwell on the ethics of policemen and informants .
we both know it's open to personal interpretation , and rests on fuzzy rules and controls .
never to guarantee impunity to an informant , or take the place ofjustice , whatever the goals .
see you soon , boss !
that's why i'm ordering your incarceration .
dennis klein , badge number 628049 .
you appeared before this board to answer on your responsibility in the death of lt. eddy valence during a police operation on glarner st , in st ouen , last january 12th .
seeing the findings of the lnternal affairs division , by ohief lnspector staneck , and the statement by lt. jenner confirming that you acted in self defense , as the man francis horn had
spontaneously opened fire ,
while you were on a reconnaissance mission .
seeing that oapt .
vrinks's statement was held to be inadmissible due to his present situation , and his closeness to the victim , this board clears you of all responsibility in this tragic matter .
hence , all charges are dropped , nothing will appear in your file .
among criminals , guys like you end up on a vacant lot , with 3 slugs in their head .
among criminals , guys like me don't listen to guys like you .
when'll dad be back?
soon .
but he hasn't left us?
why do you say that?
because you're sad .
usually when he's away , you're not sad .
usually , he doesn't go so far away .
your honor ,
i'm oaptain vrinks's wife .
my husband has been jailed for almost 3 weeks .
i'm still not allowed to see him .
my little girl asks for news of her dad every night .
why do this?
you could issue me a visiting permit now .
i have a lunch date .
excuse me .
who is this?
i want to help you .
help me do what?
i can't say on the phone .
oan we meet?
l'll call later .
l can't say on the phone .
it's him .
l'll call later .
it's his voice .
tap her phone day and night .
don't miss his call .
when you've zeroed in on silien , advise me .
only me !
hello , oamille .
got time for a coffee?
what do you want?
to say i'm sorry for what happened .
i didn't want this .
lf you need anything ...
i don't need you , dennis .
i haven't for ages .
ls that all?
no ...
that won't be necessary .
one question , mr vrinks : the same one .
where's your friend hugo silien?
my answer hasn't changed .
you can take him back .
why treat me this way?
it's how i treat people here .
i'm not like them .
i'm a cop .
you're nothing now .
handcuffs !
don't move !
the other one .
don't worsen things .
ouff yourselves to the radiator !
fast !
don't move , asshole !
hurry !
why did you do it?
to see you .
now what'll they do?
put me in the corner , till it blows over .
then i'll be let back in .
when?
soon .
hold out !
lf you can outside , i can inside .
they can't keep me for long .
why didn't you tell me?
so they couldn't question you .
how's lola?
she misses you .
what did you tell her?
the truth .
dennis came to see me at work .
what for?
he wanted to know if i knew a man called silien .
what did you say?
nothing .
i said nothing .
has he tried to reach you?
who?
silien .
has he?
answer , oamille .
no one called .
stay away , he's bad news .
you promise?
i promise .
i love you .
i love you , too .
kiss lola .
we can go now .
let me welcome here our new police ohief , mr robert mancini .
and introduce you to the man who succeeds him as the new head of the old .
oaptain dennis klein .
let's wish them both good luck .
to the new head !
what are you after?
nothing ...
i came to watch you , to learn .
thinking of him?
should l?
i thought cops were special , above bad things .
why should we be?
give me a good reason .
we're paid to be better .
my respects , ohief .
throw the fucker out !
put him in the drunk tank .
let go !
i know the way out !
he'll resign once he's sober !
under me , you'd better lose your bad habits !
this is captain klein's number .
leave a message after the beep .
boss , it's jenner .
are you in?
we tapped silien calling her again .
they're meeting at ...
i'm listening .
subject got in .
they're on rte 20 , freeway bound .
zebra 4 stay put , let them come to you .
3 and 5 stay behind .
we'll nab 'em by the freeway .
think of her , it's risky .
drive .
there's 20 grand for you .
you and your daughter .
until leo's out .
i should say thanks .
my letter explains things .
i can't do more .
lf they nab me , i'll get life .
how long's leo in for?
those are the rules .
he took a gamble and lost .
damn that .
what can you do for him?
nothing .
what's this?
you snitched !
turn !
stop !
they're headed for you now .
don't let her by !
i must !
don't let her by !
dammit !
i hear you want a transfer .
too bad .
i'd put up your name for promotion to oaptain .
like the others?
they saw it was a smart move .
i'm not made for your clan .
i'm a plain cop , no dumber than others .
i'm fine as i am .
then why didn't you speak up?
vrinks jailed , his wife dead , you as boss , suits 'em all .
why should i blab?
one day the ghosts will come and take you away .
you'll have to answer for your dirty tricks .
some day , we all have to die ...
we have to go .
sorry .
i want to kiss my daughter .
not cuffed .
i can't .
it's the rule .
i'll handle it .
no one knows why silien shot her .
bye , darling .
i'll be back soon .
wait for me .
you going back to jail?
yes , i'll write you every day .
don't leave me alone , dad .
i'm not .
granpa's there .
i love you , darling .
i love you , too .
captain vrinks released from jail ...
turn it up . ... for complicity to 2nd degree murder , the former brl chief was freed for good conduct after serving 7 years .
