you?
you again?
get out !
go on , i told you .
get out !
go on !
go on !
papa !
you filthy dog !
you settle with me !
ha ...
let's go .
welcome to you , seor .
my name is juan de dios .
i am the bell ringer .
why are you here?
to see the rojos?
no , not the rojos .
is it the baxters?
no , maybe not .
you want to get rich?
well , it's the right place .
if you use your head .
that's because everybody here has become very rich , or else they are dead .
what do you want to buy?
some guns?
liquor?
you don't buy , you sell .
you sell lead in exchange for gold?
you will get rich here .
or you'll be killed .
juan de dios tolls the bell once again .
saludos , amigo .
it's not smart to go wandering so far from home .
i reckon he picked the wrong trail .
or he could have picked the wrong town .
his big mistake was getting born .
you want any work ,
iookin 'like that , ya could try bein 'a scarecrow !
oh , no !
the crows are liable to scare him maybe .
ha ha !
hello .
saludos .
you can't get rich like that !
at most , you will only succeed in being killed !
we have enough trouble .
what are you looking for?
food , somethin 'to drink .
water's over there .
no .
no water .
eating , drinking , killing .
that's all you can do , just like the rest of your kind .
by the way , you'll have to mark this up .
i know , you have no money .
after all , you just got into town .
but if you don't mind killing , you will find someone eager to pay you .
hm mm .
my roulette wheel .
that , too , was murdered .
no one ever comes here to play .
we spend our time between funerals and burials .
yeah .
never saw a town as dead as this one .
you will never see another like it .
what's wrong with the place?
we've had too many killings .
you have seen the women?
none of them are women , they're widows .
the place has only widows .
here , you can only gain respect by killing other men .
so nobody works .
somebody doesn't share your opinion .
yes .
saludos !
you know why piripero looked you over?
to take your measurements .
he can do it with a glance .
you will be a customer .
hm .
i'm not joking .
those murderers will make a corpse out of you one day .
that's why i want you to get out of here .
you don't want to stay in this cemetery , finish up and get out .
i told ya i can't pay ya .
be my guest .
but get out of san miguel , will you?
where does that lead?
the balcony .
why are you going there?
hey !
to have a look .
things always look different from higher up .
but nothing's up there !
go ahead and get out !
who are they?
hm .
bandits .
bandits and smugglers .
they come down from texas to stock up on guns and liquor .
the cost is much less here .
they sell guns and liquor to the lndians .
any town that sells guns and liquor has gotta be rich .
not the town .
only those who buy and sell .
the bosses are the ones who clean up .
somebody has to run the place .
every town has a boss .
that's true , but when there are two , i'd say that there is one too many .
two bosses?
very interesting .
interesting is right .
the rojos , three brothers who sell liquor .
and then there's the baxters , big gun merchants .
ah , if i'm not mistaken , you already met baxter's gang .
yeah , we met .
but you're lucky .
they don't usually limit their fire to the mule .
a man looks around for any reason ,
juan de dios tolls the bell , piripero sells another coffin .
two bosses .
they've enlisted all the scum from both sides of the frontier .
and they pay in dollars .
baxters over there .
rojos there .
me right in the middle .
where you do what?
crazy bell ringer was right .
there's money to be made in a place like this .
if you're thinking what i suspect i tell you , don't try it .
which one of the two is the stronger?
which one of them is stronger?
well , the rojos , especially ramon .
don miguel rojo , i wanna talk to you .
don miguel , i hear you're hirin 'on men .
well , i might just be available .
i gotta tell ya before you hire me ,
i don't work cheap .
get three coffins ready .
huh?
adios , amigo .
stranger , didn't you get the idea?
we don't like bad boys like you in town .
go get your mule .
you let him get away from you?
that's what i wanna talk about .
he's feelin 'real bad .
huh?
my mule .
you see , he got all riled up when you fired those shots at his feet .
hey , are you makin 'some kinda joke?
no .
i understand you were playin 'around .
but the mule , he just doesn't get it .
if you were to all apologise ...
i don't think it's nice , you laughin '.
see , my mule don't like people laughin '.
he gets the idea you're laughin 'at him .
now , if you apologise , like i know you will ,
i might convince him that you really didn't mean it .
i saw it .
you killed all four of them .
you'll pay , all right .
you'll be strung up .
who are you?
don't fire a shot .
i'm john baxter sheriff .
yeah .
well , if you're the sheriff , you better get these men underground .
my mistake .
four coffins .
hey !
i told you i wasn't cheap , but i think you'll find it's worth your while . .. 98 , 99 , 100 .
the rest when you're all done .
when do i start?
i'm not in a hurry , at least for the moment .
with four less baxters , now is as good a time to start as any .
in a few days , a troop of cavalry will pass through san miguel .
i wouldn't want the military sticking their long noses into our business .
you seem to be well informed .
in these parts , a man's life often depends on a mere scrap of information .
hm .
this thing couldn't have been very useful to its owner .
my brother ramon did that !
he often uses it for target practice .
with a gun in his hand , no one stands in his way .
the armour is one of his favourite targets .
naturally , when he doesn't have anything better to shoot .
well , i'll be kinda curious to meet this brother of yours .
ah , this is chico , one of the most trusted of my men .
follow him .
he will bring you to your room .
i would like you to feel at home .
well , i never found home that great .
let's go .
who's that?
her name is marisol .
you just forget about her .
this one will be your room .
you gave him 100 .
we've never paid that much before .
can you explain why you have taken him on?
to have a filthy gringo here , and to give him 100 besides?
we have never paid anybody so much .
you cannot leave someone like that to do what he wants !
he might do anything and i want law and order in this place !
if that is all you want , there is a much cheaper way .
just snuff him out .
and who will be the one?
you?
yes .
why not?
a shot in his back and then you would have him out of the way in no time at all .
listen , i could do it easily right now .
he won't be expecting it , and i'd get back the 100 .
you are stupid , esteban !
even if you are my brother !
a bullet in the back and it is ended !
and what happens if your hand should tremble and he's only been hurt?
with the cavalry arriving in town , and that yankee so quick on the draw ...
but i was only thinking ...
don't think !
you let me do the thinking .
go and see the americano .
ask if he needs anything .
make friends .
get one thing clear .
this is going to be a quiet town until ramon gets back !
is that clear?
a quiet town .
i am esteban rojo .
my brother asked me to ...
what are you doing?
moving .
but didn't you know all our men live here with us?
that's all very cosy , but , uh , i don't find you men all that appealin '.
besides , your brother said he didn't have any need for me any more right now .
halt !
sergeant .
yes , capitan?
tell the men we'll spend tonight here .
arrange it so they can pick up the supplies here .
also double the guard on the stagecoach there .
yes , sir .
now , what do you suppose is in that coach?
it would be easy to find out .
get up close and take a look inside .
if they fire at you , you know it's gold .
not a bad idea .
mm .
looking for anything?
hello .
get out of here , yankee .
vamos .
why aren't you sleeping?
when i see you staring like that , it bothers me .
i keep wondering what was in that stagecoach .
it's something they think is very important .
i asked a few questions of the captain and almost was arrested .
who's marisol?
you'd better get some sleep .
you need it .
much too dangerous , even for you .
all i did is ask who she was .
she is a woman .
ramon's madly in love with her .
does that make it clear to you?
mm .
everybody in this town talks about ramon .
i'm curious to meet him .
if you're smart , you'll try to stay clear of ramon as long as possible .
ah !
there are the soldiers .
they're moving off very quietly .
strange .
they're headed for the frontier .
tell me , is that the way you go to bed every night?
don't worry .
i didn't dirty the sheets .
no , wait !
i'm coming , too !
i want to see how you're going to get in trouble .
ha ha .
all right , all right .
go ahead .
it's like playing cowboys and lndians .
captain .
welcome , lieutenant .
there is your gold as promised .
i hope the guns you are giving us will be equally useful to our army .
rest assured , captain .
we'll check 'em over together .
get their clothes on again , and hurry .
be sure to place them around right .
they died fighting among themselves .
rubio !
there .
it's ramon .
this is my brother ramon .
i think i mentioned him .
everybody talks about ramon .
and many speak of you , too .
my dear brother included .
well , i hope they say ... nice things?
did you have a good trip?
it was tiring .
it was terribly hard on the road during the day .
and stagecoaches are an uncomfortable way to travel .
well , i'm sure you'll be in great shape in no time .
the americano cannot wait to get into action !
i am sorry .
he is going to be a disappointed man .
how's that?
the baxters accepted the invitation .
they'll come tonight , don miguel .
you must be out of your head !
i told chico to invite them here .
ramon , what is this?
i found out many things travelling .
i have decided that ... it's very stupid .
we just keep on shooting at each other and without results .
you've gone out of your mind , ramon !
no , i've come to my senses , esteban .
believe me .
trust me .
life can be so precious .
it's foolish to risk losing it every minute , no?
there's enough space for everybody in this town .
even baxters , hm?
for this reason ,
i've decided to hang my gun up on the wall .
i think that ramon is right .
i , too , am tired of these killings .
they must stop !
this is all ... very , very touching .
you don't admire peace?
it's not really easy to like something you know nothing about .
stay here and you may just profit from the experience .
no , thanks .
i'll be movin 'on .
here's your money , don miguel .
i only used a small amount of it .
i don't like to take money unless i feel i've earned it .
why are you so hasty?
stay here .
you might enjoy dining with us tonight .
you see , the baxters have four men in the cemetery on account of me .
i don't think they'd appreciate my presence .
he is too smart to be just a hired fighter .
with a pistol , no one can touch him .
when someone with that face works with his gun , count on two things .
he's fast , but he's also intelligent .
that makes him too dangerous for you .
now he's gone , explain that nonsense about hanging up your gun and making up with the baxters .
is it possible that you'll never be able to reach any conclusions on your own?
our government and the americanos will find those bodies and investigate .
they'll investigate , all right .
and we'll be quiet and peacefully bide our time .
we know nothing about a massacre at the rio bravo , eh?
i arranged for the bodies to be lying as if both companies killed each other .
but do you think they'll believe it?
ah , yes , i think so .
because if they don't find a guilty party , they will call off the investigation .
yes , but ... what about the baxters?
the baxters?
they want nothing more than to live in peace .
we'll let them have their own way for a while .
so , forget the baxters .
we'll take care of them later when the investigation finishes !
that was a fine idea that you had .
what was it again?
ah , yes , yes , yes , yes .
the baxters on one side , the rojos on the other .
and you'd be in the middle .
the only problem is that they've joined up .
now you have no job and no money to pay me what you owe me .
there is only one thing for you to do .
leave .
i'll forget about what you owe me .
leave san miguel and never come back for the rest of your days .
hey , joe !
i prepared the wagon the way you asked me to .
we're sitting in the back here with two empty coffins .
what are you up to?
are you changing your profession?
if you want to go on living , you'd better .
in my opinion , you will make a fine pallbearer .
close this place and come with me .
oh , close up , huh?
it's done .
where are we going?
i'd like to know , or is it a secret?
down by the river , to have a look at some corpses down there .
the rojos say come to dinner and we must go , but i don't like it at all .
even if they've granted all the guarantees we demanded .
we'll go along with it , but don't touch anything !
you mustn't eat .
you mustn't drink .
you just keep your eyes open and keep your wits about you .
whoa ...
are you sure that nobody has seen us?
only a ghost or two .
no , no , no .
don't joke about things like this .
ghosts are better left where they are .
you look as though this place suits you very well .
and if you go on like this , you will soon be here permanently .
hee hee !
why is it , with all those bodies , we are just burying these two?
we're not ... gonna bury 'em .
we are not burying them?
that's right , we're not gonna bury 'em .
if we are not burying them , i would like to know what we will use them for?
why are we taking the trouble to do this?
the dead can be very useful sometimes .
they've helped me outta tough spots more than once .
first , they don't talk .
second , they can be made to look alive if i manage it right .
yeah .
and third , if you shoot 'em , there's no worry cos they're dead already .
understand?
it makes no sense to me and i'm getting out !
i'm alive and i want to remain with the living .
and when i'm dead , i'll want to remain with the dead .
i hope that's clear .
also , i don't like the idea that you've placed those bodies there .
the man buried there is the only one who ever died of pneumonia here !
take it easy , will ya?
our friends here are gonna help me pay your bill .
ah , get up there !
their only reason to start a war would be to kidnap you from your husband's side .
he is gallant , this rojo .
i didn't think him capable of compliments .
he's not .
all that he says is false , like his proposals .
you women ! lf things aren't complicated for you , you become suspicious .
yes .
because to me it just didn't seem right .
it went too smoothly .
i don't trust them .
you'd like to prove me wrong , wouldn't you?
always the same thing .
goodnight .
goodnight .
don't worry .
i'm not gonna hurt ya .
i just want ya to know why the rojos wanna make peace all of a sudden .
there was once a wagonload of gold that the soldiers were takin 'to the border .
john !
come up here quickly .
sorry .
when a husband finds a man in his wife's bedroom , you're never sure how he's gonna react .
give him 500 .
how's that?
give the money to him .
he has an interesting story .
listen to him .
that's the right idea?
i get the wrong idea only when it suits me .
ramon !
the soldiers escorting the gold ...
two of them got away .
they're hiding out in the cemetery .
the baxters are about to capture them .
hey !
rubio !
get the men .
you are well informed .
a man's life here often depends on a mere scrap of information .
your brother's own words .
tell me , why are you doing this for us?
500 .
with these two soldiers as witnesses against ramon , the government will rid the town of the rojos .
then san miguel will have just one boss .
hurry !
let's go !
coming with us?
no , no .
when a man's got money in his pocket , he appreciates peace .
come on !
whoa !
let's leave the horses here .
por dios !
who is there?
come out !
ohh !
what do you think?
i don't know .
there's somethin 'about it i don't like .
too still to be wounded , more like dummies .
sure !
dummies that interest the rojos .
better hide .
hurry !
what do we do?
circle around to the side .
keep them busy long enough for me to get those two .
go on !
go on !
quickly !
keep me covered .
i'll take care of those two .
listen , baxter !
you can have them now if you like !
since dead men can't talk !
it seems they didn't like my joke .
we'll let them go home in a while .
this bad boy will be our guest only until baxter leaves san miguel for the frontier .
put him in the cellar .
esteban , good work !
with antonio as our prisoner , the baxters will have to give in to us .
now we can make any kind of demand !
don miguel !
don miguel !
what has happened?
talk , will you !
i don't know who , but somebody shot at me .
marisol !
marisol !
where are you , marisol? !
strange ... how you always manage to be in the right place at the right time .
it's nothing serious , a headache that will pass .
she'll sleep .
keep your eyes open .
she's not to move from that room , you hear?
i wouldn't mention i brought her here .
i wouldn't want the rojos to think i was on your side .
don't be worried .
i'm rich enough to appreciate the men that my money can buy .
i've been to talk to the rojos .
they'll give back antonio in exchange for marisol in the morning .
very soon , you're going to be rich .
uh huh .
yeah , that's not gonna break my heart .
where is she?
you said i'd see her !
where is she?
i want to see her !
come back here , jesus .
come here .
i want to see her !
why can't i look at her?
i want to see her !
go .
go to him , marisol .
mama !
mama !
jesus !
mama !
jesus !
mama !
mama !
mama !
julio .
marisol .
get julio .
you were warned to get outta town .
now i'm gonna make you pay once and for all .
let him be .
you better get goin '.
ramon's waitin '.
and you , get that kid home where he belongs .
a pig , that ramon !
tell me , what's ramon got to do with them?
you weren't told , eh?
in these parts , the story is very old .
a happy little family until trouble comes along .
trouble is ramon .
claiming the husband cheated at cards , which wasn't true , he gets the wife to live with him as hostage .
the husband?
him , there's nothing for him to do .
the rojos threatened to kill his boy , jesus .
he was forced to accept things .
that ramon is smart .
where are you going?
to the rojos , to look for a job .
poo !
i'm glad we have the americano with us .
it's the best thing to happen to us .
if either government starts an enquiry , we'll need every man we can get .
to be at war with the baxters now is worse than sitting on a case of dynamite .
where should we put this?
put it over there .
come on , everybody .
drink up !
good shooting .
very good shooting .
to kill a man , you shoot for his heart , and a winchester is the best weapon .
that's very nice , but i'll stick with my . 45 .
when a man with a . 45 meets a man with a rifle , the man with the pistol will be a dead man .
that's an old mexican proverb , and it's true .
you believe that?
paquito , take five men and escort marisol to the small house .
everything is prepared .
do not worry .
i will return tomorrow .
the wagons are ready .
we can leave .
everyone !
enjoy yourselves during my absence !
you heard ramon , let's have a good time .
he weighs over a ton .
of course , with all he poured into himself .
papa , did you not tell me no one could go see mama?
that's right .
then , why does that man see her when i cannot?
i want mama !
come away from the door .
quiet .
we cannot show ourselves .
you must stay away .
hello .
there's somebody shooting at the small house .
saddle the horses immediately !
come on , let's go !
look out !
take this money .
it's enough to live on for a while .
now , get across the border .
get as far away from san miguel as possible .
how may we thank you for what you are doing?
don't try .
just get goin 'before the rojos get here .
why do you do this for us?
why?
i knew someone like you once .
no one was there to help .
get movin '.
get movin '.
get outta here !
what do you see , chico?
they're all dead .
they massacred them .
they kidnapped marisol !
this looks like the work of the baxters .
quick !
let's get back before they attack our house in the town .
chico , give out the ammunition .
esteban , spread your men around the house .
keep your eyes open .
miguel , paco , behind the house .
manolo and alvaro , come with me .
stay alert !
the way they killed those men , there must be a lot of them .
it's a warm evening .
one of our wagons lost a wheel so we had to turn back here to get help .
one of the men tells me ... the baxters attacked the small house .
do you know about it?
tell me what you know .
oh !
well?
where did you hide marisol?
rubio .
you are thirsty?
you want to drink?
no , no .
it is too soon to drink .
ooh !
bring him over here .
you are a stubborn idiot .
tell us where marisol is and it'll all be ended .
in a week , you'll be back in shape , and you can go wherever you want .
that's enough for today .
sooner or later he'll talk .
it's just a matter of time .
he mustn't escape or die .
otherwise , do as you like .
wait till he comes to .
this way he hardly feels anything .
i have a poker hand waiting for me .
now i am stuck here !
i can't get back to it !
this is more amusing than cards .
just be sure he does not die , and also make sure he regrets the day he was born .
the gringo is asleep , i imagine .
that's all right .
i'll enjoy waking him up .
esteban , what was that noise?
i do not know .
i heard a yell and then a crash .
it's useless to hide !
you are finished playing the smart boy .
go up and look in the loft !
and take a look behind the barrels !
let's get out of here !
hurry !
hurry !
come on !
you , come along with me !
surround the town !
block the streets leading out !
find him for me !
esteban , search the whole town !
follow me !
get him back right now !
you've got to at any cost !
look in the stables , in every corral , in the store !
look for him in the church !
go in there !
search every inch of it !
search everywhere !
rubio , in here !
if somebody is hiding him , burn their house down and kill them !
you , come here !
look for him near the baxters ', but take him alive .
i want him alive !
alive !
rubio , ... in the bar .
he says he knows nothing .
he's being smart .
bring him here to me .
i swear i'm telling the truth .
well , ... you know nothing , huh?
nothing !
i have not seen him !
rubio , you take care of him !
where have you hidden him?
i ... didn't ... hide ...
you are the right friend for that filthy americano .
you'll end up the same way .
we looked everywhere .
in his cellar , in the attic , on the roof , but there is no trace .
i couldn't find anybody in the back room .
he has taken refuge with the baxters .
the americano isn't stupid .
he knows that's the best place to hide .
the baxters , eh?
then better go and get him .
and that's for being his friend .
curse them !
piripero !
eh?
piripero !
hm?
come here .
i can't see anybody .
come here .
dios mio !
what are you doing in there?
never mind .
get me outta here .
but you're not dead yet .
i will be , if you don't get me outta here quick .
get the lid down .
rubio .
i see some signs of life .
let's be ready when they decide to come out .
don't shoot !
we surrender !
don't shoot !
don't shoot !
we're coming out !
i surrender !
hold back your fire !
don't shoot !
we're surrendering !
stop .
i wanna take a look at this .
ramon !
don't shoot !
we're comin 'out .
we surrender !
listen , you've won !
it's enough !
i'll get outta town !
i'll do whatever you like !
you promise that?
i swear it , ramon !
you won't try any tricks?
none .
no , no tricks .
i said before , i give you my word , we'll leave !
are you sure?
you had better ask permission of your wife .
maybe she won't be too happy !
antonio !
john !
murderers .
they had no guns !
murderers !
i hope you rot in hell !
may you all die spitting blood !
curse you for this !
murderers !
let's go .
the show's over anyway .
keep looking for him !
search among those bodies !
the filthy americano has to be somewhere .
silvanito?
where's silvanito?
any news today?
i have to tell you some bad news .
i hate to tell you this , joe , but ...
where is silvanito?
he was captured this morning by those men of ramon's .
they grabbed him on his way here .
he was bringing in some provisions .
he is being tortured , but he won't talk .
he's stubborn .
whatever they do , he won't say a word , even if it means his life .
listen to me .
they'll never be able to force him .
now , old fool , loosen up your tongue .
no .
rubio !
get back to your shop .
you're liable to have business there .
very good !
that's what i wanted to hear .
i brought a little surprise for you .
i know how much you will need it .
it was hard to get my hands on it .
i got it by using my head .
no one can resist two bottles of wine .
i thought you might need that pistol .
and i brought another present .
it's dynamite .
i stole it from the rojos .
the moment's come for you to light the fuse and send it back to them .
still lots of light .
too early to be asleep yet .
rubio , here .
i shouldn't like to ruin the rifle .
i could never find another like this one .
later , ramon .
let's try it with this one now .
gringo !
i heard you wanted to see me .
the americano's dead .
cut the old man down .
what's wrong , ramon?
