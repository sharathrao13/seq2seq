thank you , thank you , thank you .
you are my god .
my inspiration , my everything .
he's on a different level now , how he listens ... ... and plays records .
i think he's very special ... ... because no other dj can do that .
i don't know what he was doing , whether he was ... ... honing his talents in another direction .
he just disappeared from the scene completely .
it was really depressing .
he's probably down in south america , still hanging out .
probably trying to snort up one of the countries , or ...
i don't know , he's just ...
i like to think he's still out there .
frankie , i'm curious .
can you tell me about your flip flop collection?
i'm a bit of the lmelda marcos of the flip flop world .
flip flop , for me , is perfection .
and sometimes if i'm stuck and i can't mix , i can't ...
you know , i'm a creative person .
i'm an artist .
so sometimes i just stare at a flip flop for hours .
i'm not joking .
i'm being serious , yeah .
really?
yes , i do .
recently , you've been married ... ... so how is it now being a husband?
an " ass band "?
husband .
oh , husband .
husband .
a husband .
yeah , it's very nice .
it's what i've ...
say hello !
hello , lbiza !
dj !
dj !
dj !
dj !
this is pete tong , you're listening to the essential selection .
i'm sitting across from frankie wilde .
how are you , frankie?
i feel like a star , man .
eleven years .
eleven years in ibiza ... ... playing some of the best clubs in the world .
how do you feel about it this year?
what , mate?
it's your 11 th year , frankie , playing in ibiza .
you must be thrilled .
it's been fucking hot , ain't it , here , the last week?
god .
i mean ... ... think about ...
you're old , like me .
you're an old geezer .
you remember that martini campaign in the '70s?
martini is
dot , dot , dot , dot .
remember that?
when i was a kid , that wow ed me out , man , bigtime .
it's like , " is " what?
what the fuck is it?
what the fuck is martini?
but i was young , and i didn't really understand .
lbiza is
dot , dot , dot , dot .
you know what i mean?
and that's really nice .
it's really nice to be able to feel that .
there's spunk everywhere on this island .
everyone's done it , and they've been free with it .
they haven't done it to make babies .
they've fucking swung out and spun a bit out ... ... and it's hit a plant , and that's grown .
wall , and there's vines and ivy and shit .
it's all spunk .
look at this lot out here .
look at them .
they all love it .
they fucking love it .
who out there likes to fucking party?
yeah !
i can't hear you !
who out there likes to fucking party?
who likes to fucking party?
yeah !
frankie was definitely one of the best .
he had his very , sort of , own style ... ... his very own momentum with the crowd .
no one else did it his way .
he's a showman as much as he is a musician .
he controlled the crowd musically and physically .
he was a born natural behind the turntable .
there's no doubt .
i was jealous of that .
i always had to try a bit harder .
super , super , super , loco .
frankie was cruising along , doing his thing ... ... getting all the attention that he needed .
and then he met max .
no .
hey , tell him it's like a wasp just stung my clit , yeah .
i don't give a fuck if he's religious .
tell him anyway .
fuck him .
bye .
anyway ...
a bit of a tosser .
not my sort of person ... ... but absolutely took him to the next level .
i love you , max !
max first brought frankie to my attention .
i knew he had what it took behind the decks ... ... but it turned out that frankie really understood the music production side .
you know , knew his way around a studio .
do you think we're making a jazz album?
i'm just right in the middle of going all the fucking way .
should we swap them over for some brushes?
start fucking hitting those drums .
start banging those drums like you bang your fucking sister !
clear , siegfried?
that's the first one .
so i signed him straightaway .
and frankie delivered .
it was massive .
come out of car windows , in the supermarket .
even my grandmother ... ... would whistle that tune when i went to see her in the nursing home .
frankie met sonya when they were on the video shoot to " rise again .
oh , man .
i mean , everybody knew that she'd been about .
but he seemed to like that .
i mean , that was his thing .
you know , i mean , even i'd had a go at her .
15 love .
i was thinking , you know how paul newman's got ... ... his salad dressings and that?
so why not frankie wilde hummus?
that's a good idea .
people come and see the gigs ... ... they say , " fuck , that was a great set , frankie .
i'll say , " cheers , mate .
you want some hummus?
you know , just as a thing .
yeah .
quite a good name for an album .
how's that?
frankie wilde , hummus .
what , call my album hummus?
yeah .
i don't think so .
i've got good ideas , frankie .
you should listen to me .
if i've got my own hummus brand and my album's called hummus ... ... it's getting a bit much .
i think it's a good name .
why don't i change my name to " frankie hummus "?
no , it sounds good .
yeah .
i think a lot of people tolerated her because she was frankie's wife .
at the end of the day , i think she was partying with everyone else .
i didn't like her .
i didn't think she was good for him .
i fucking hate you .
i fucking hate you .
and did i fuck her?
yeah .
yeah , i fucked her .
legend has it that frank's problems started undramatically .
it was the simplest thing that kicked it off .
it was years and years of noise was the basis of the problem .
but the very beginnings of it , in his life , started very plainly .
frankie's problem was quite a common problem amongst dj's ... ... an occupational hazard .
they work in the clubs .
the noise just takes its toll .
this geezer's gonna go .
he's gonna lose it .
and he did lose it .
i watched him lose it , slowly but surely .
fucking come on , then !
i think we could have the spanish look , i like this color for the water .
perhaps maybe that one , japanese .
frankie .
morning , honey .
oh , frankie !
come here .
i want to ask you something .
morning .
morning , sweet ...
you all right?
if we go for the spanish look ...
it's for the garden .
a bit of both .
okay .
little bit of both .
we can do that , can't we?
yeah .
fuck !
fucking hell !
you all right?
his hearing was fucked .
but he tried to keep working and plow through .
you know , put the horse blinkers on .
ignore the problem , and it'll go away .
you know , always works for me .
can you tell us what's happening with the new album?
have i got a spot?
have i ...?
no .
it's fine .
you're perfect .
you're perfect .
your fans are curious about the new album .
they have to know .
it's good .
it's going really well .
it's going really well .
been bending the sound , sort of .
i've been forging it .
with a lyrical smelter .
yeah .
not as beautiful as you .
thank you .
and i got these two ... ... like , austrian mates ... ... who are stoking the fires .
everybody should have at least two austrian mates .
everybody should have at least two .
when can we expect the new album to come out?
soon .
soon?
ish .
can i have a word?
can i have a word?
yeah .
it's good?
i took a call just before , a couple of hours ago .
i forgot to mention it , but i need to ...
i need to ...
the album people , they want the lyrics for the sleeve .
i just need you to write them down .
we can pop them off .
get them off and we don't have to worry about it .
no , no , we never write them down .
that's it .
what else did you sing after that?
frankie .
frank .
frank !
what?
have you got a condom?
have you got a condom?
no , i'm not gonna fuck her .
i'm knackered .
i'm just gonna have a nosh .
frankie !
frankie !
frankie !
well , denial is a river in frank , and it runs deep .
and his sets were shambolic on times .
clearly , could only be the work of a man who couldn't hear .
it wasn't pretty , but , you know , for me ... ... for someone that has gone through something like that ... ... to still get up there and give it a go is a big thing .
off !
off !
off !
off !
let go , fuckers !
fuckers !
fucking fuckers !
because they dangle when they're cold .
yeah .
now , listen very carefully , okay?
it's very important .
this is very important .
i have cancer , okay?
and i'm very delicate .
so they have to be very gentle .
hey , frank .
all right?
how are you?
all right .
attaboy .
how you doing?
good , good .
motherfucker .
listen , i had that dream again .
i was sucking my own cock .
but this time , i don't have a huge cock .
i have a normal sized cock .
no spine .
my spine disappears .
so my head , it just flops down onto my ...
anyway ...
you all right?
yeah .
sit down , sit down , sit down .
look , i was just talking to the label ... ... and they'd like to see a couple of tracks .
the label would like a couple of tracks , frank .
it's coming .
it's coming .
yeah .
the tracks are coming , man , relax .
don't worry , mate , it's fine .
it's all right .
i saw your show last night .
i tell you , i really fucked up last night , man .
it's my call .
i picked the wrong set .
it stunk .
it stunk like shit , frank .
it stunk like ...
well , like you shit your pants ... ... and you just sat in it for a week , and then you shit yourself again .
that's how fucking bad it stunk , frank .
it was shit , yeah?
it was shit , frank .
yes , it was shit .
i tell you , the fucking monitors at that place .
you know , i'm fucking mixing my heart out .
i can't hear a fucking thing .
we gotta have words with them ... ... get this sorted out , otherwise we blow that place out .
i couldn't hear a fucking thing .
right .
because you might be deaf , frank .
what's that?
you could be deaf , frank .
what you saying?
you are deaf .
can't hear you , max .
you're fucking deaf , asshole !
who the fuck you fooling , frank?
you're talking like a 95 year old war vet .
frank , you need professional help .
i'm thinking about getting some professional help .
yeah .
yeah .
fuck it .
hello , frank .
come in , frank .
frank !
i don't want you to panic , frank .
i've got some bad news for you , though .
you're going deaf .
completely deaf .
as you know , your right ear is completely shot .
your left ear , that's this one , has got 20 percent left .
you were born with little holes in them ... ... and slowly the fluid pressure is dropping .
can't you just plug it up with some ear putty or something?
the ear organism , it's way too sensitive and delicate for that .
surgery doesn't work .
cochlear implant doesn't work .
you've gotta stop exposing yourself to so much noise .
what do you mean by that?
it means that if you listen to absolute silence ... ... your ears are gonna last a little bit longer .
they're crumbling as we speak .
stop the drugs , frank .
stop the drinking .
go to bed at a decent hour .
we can give you a hearing aid that gives you temporary hearing ... ... but that damages the ear even further .
speak up .
these are the facts , frank .
these are the facts , frank .
we can't change them .
you are deaf , man .
you are a deaf man .
this is costing me 2000 fucking euros an hour .
chuck me a fucking bone !
this is your hearing aid , frank .
use it only when you have to .
only when you have to .
only when i have to .
right .
only when you have to .
got that?
no exceptions .
can you keep on gigging?
frankie?
can you keep on gigging?
can you keep on gigging?
i love them both , you know?
i love hearing , and i love dj'ing .
i was thinking this morning maybe i should write a book .
that's a brilliant idea .
that might take years , though , so ...
perhaps , like , a pamphlet .
a sort of brochure thing .
listen , frankie , i ...
i want to tell you that whatever your decision ... ... i will support it wholeheartedly .
you and me and little kingie .
that's all that matters to me .
deaf , dumb or blind , baby , we will get through this .
it's brilliant to almost hear that .
fair play to the guy .
i have no idea what i would have done in that situation .
i mean , there he is .
you know , he's between a rock ... ... and you know , another rock ... ... which is harder and bigger .
hi .
i'm actually thinking about giving it a bit of a break .
of course i fucking love you .
how can you say that?
i just think we don't necessarily bring out the best in each other .
not always the best thing for me .
it's my problem .
it's not your problem .
you know what i mean?
why can't we just be mates for a little bit?
i could just give you a ring every few weeks , you know?
just make it a little bit more casual .
couldn't we do that?
it sounds like the caca .
no .
is frank there?
is this frank standing in front of me?
no , this is a drunken baboon drooling on the mix board .
what in all of the heavens are you on , frank?
are you fucking deaf or something?
what's your fucking problem?
they would laugh you out of austria .
i can hear them laughing now .
where is frankie fucking wilde , frankie?
is he fucking gone?
and the fucking , " go away .
stay , stay , stay , " huh?
so you're deaf?
you're deaf?
almost .
this is like all the terrors and the horrors of the world ... ... raining down on your skull .
last three months , it's really rapidly accelerated .
but i've ...
i've got this .
and i really thought i could do this job , man .
i'll show you .
hello , mr. drum !
drummer !
the left ear , there's still a little bit left .
and this little fella is a fucking lifeline , man .
but i can use it only when i have to .
long as i'm careful , i can hear more .
what?
what has happened?
what?
he was stone fucking deaf .
there's not much you can do as a dj if you can't hear .
generally , the field of music ... ... other than the obvious example ... ... has been dominated by people who can hear .
he was never gonna hear again .
it was as simple as that .
it was ... ... gone .
all right , frankie?
all right?
blink !
hola , mate .
all right?
all right .
good game?
is it a good game?
yeah , it's all right .
it's pretty good .
it's decent .
sonya in?
sonya in?
yeah , she's here .
she's upstairs .
she's packing , mate .
she all right?
she's leaving you , frank .
she's leaving you .
for me .
get in there !
did you see that?
fucking hell !
fucking , how was that one , eh?
ter fucking rific !
yes , brilliant , wasn't it?
want a line?
not right now , thanks .
cheers .
frankie .
you all right?
yeah .
i'm leaving you .
i'm gonna take the tiger .
that's mine .
and i want those ones , obviously , because they're mine .
and you can have the sculpture that your mother bought us .
aren't you upset , frankie?
do you wanna say anything to me?
anything at all?
frankie !
where the fuck's the album , frank?
where the fuck is the album , frank? !
where the fuck is the album? !
it smells like shit in here , frank .
what the fuck's happened to you?
what the fuck happened to you , frank?
i don't know what this is .
i don't know what this is .
this is bullshit , frank .
this isn't how you take on things , huh?
listen ...
maybe this isn't the worst thing in the world .
take some fucking time off .
go in the sun for fuck's sakes , huh?
eat a lot of fruit , get some fucking vitamins in you .
vegetables and greens and shit .
i can't ...
you know , there's ...
i was reading yesterday ... ... there's a fish , it's called a zebra fish .
has little hairs on it .
and somehow , they can implant that ...
i don't know .
it's too fucking hot .
it's always too fucking hot .
i can't help you .
i don't know how to ...
i don't know how to help ... i don't want to help you .
i can't help you .
i didn't want a deaf dj on the label .
i didn't want the company to be touched with the deaf stamp .
well , business is tough ... ... and sometimes you have to make awkward decisions .
and i've made harder decisions than dropping the deaf dj .
frank just locks himself up in his room ... ... didn't come out of his villa for a long time .
he had this theory he was gonna get his hearing back ... ... by having complete silence .
he wanted to rest his ears completely .
he hired people to bring in supplies for him to the villa .
the only accounts we have of frank during this period ... ... come from various drug dealers .
he was in a very dark place .
i love you too .
where is frankie wilde today?
what?
i haven't ...
i haven't talked to him in almost a year now .
i've heard some stories .
this guy supposedly saw him in new york ... ... wearing a garbage bag for a hat and shoeboxes on his feet .
and he ...
and he had a rock ... ... and he was trying to eat it like a sandwich .
i don't ...
i don't think frankie would do that .
he looked like a bum .
he always looked like a bum .
but he had a really special bond with the homeless .
hello .
hello?
hello .
is this where you come if you want to learn how to read lips?
of course .
you want to learn?
i've got no idea what you're saying , darling .
i can't hear anything .
this is the place , yeah?
they look like a couple of cunts .
i don't know how to lip read .
maybe you should write something down .
i can't hear you , and i can't read lips .
so we need to get started somehow .
so , maybe , write something down .
temper , temper .
watch .
concentrate .
watch my lips .
watch ... ... lips .
tongue .
jaw .
one's facial expression ... ... gesture .
lip reading ... ... is about seeing ... ... feeling .
fill in the blanks , frank .
stepdad .
husband .
the quick brown fox .

cheers .
you and me got the same hobby .

double scotch again .
in england , it means " fuck off .
very similar gesture .
fuck off .
double .
double fuck off .
waiter !
double scotch , please , mate .
no , more .
what do you want to drink to?
do you want to drink to something?
who's simon?
silence .
who is he?
not simon , silence .
are you finished with him?
good .
great .
i know what i could do .
i know what i could do .
i know what i could do .
fuck the dj lark .
you know on tv , you got a little ugly bird ... ... bottom right hand corner , doing all this business?
i could do that .
i could be a cool one .
a cool little fucker in the corner of the box .
i could .
think positively .
yeah .
are you going down to pacha tonight?
oh , no , mate .
no , i'm staying in because frankie wilde's ... ... at the right hand bottom corner of the tv tonight ... ... doing the fucking hand jive .
it'll be brilliant .
you finish?
you finish?
there's nothing wrong with being deaf .
i'm deaf .
trust your other senses .
your sight , your smell and your touch .
just relax .
it will come .
it just takes time .
it will come .
well , frank's system was ingenious , and with the weight of his sight ... ... he proclaims that he began to see a rhythm in everything ... ... a pattern in the visual world around him .
you know , could see music .
frankie had worked with this all his life ... ... and then he realized he was able to piece together ... ... those sets that he used to do .
and ...
hey , presto , you know , four to the floor , returneth .
i once stole 500 quid from your wallet , in the studio .
well ... ... it's only money , eh?
no big deal .
and it was me who stuck that scaff bar ... ... through the windscreen of your merc .
it wasn't that asian kid .
well , he's probably out now anyway ... ... so no harm done .
i shagged twila .
for three years .
because you're a mate , yeah ... ... i only ever made love to her bum .
she doesn't like it in the bum .
have a listen to this .
tell me what you think .
yeah?
open the door !
frank !
frank !
open the fucking door !
open the door !
frank !
frank !
open the fucking door !
do you want some more coffee?
frank !
frank !
open the door .
open the fucking door .
so?
oh , frank .
oh , god .
yeah?
oh , god , it's good ,
fucking good .
it's good?
okay , it's fucking hot .
first off , did you ...?
who's this?
max , this is penelope .
penelope , this is max .
hi , max .
hi .
forget it .
look , did you mix this?
yeah .
did you produce this?
yeah .
oh , fuck .
fuck it , frank .
it's gold .
fucking gold .
it's beautiful .
tell me !
i haven't heard it .
it gets in your fucking chest .
i've never heard nothing like it .
like fucking heart .
it changed ...
what ...?
what do you mean you haven't heard it?
what do you mean?
well , i haven't heard it .
why?
i'm completely deaf , max .
completely?
yeah .
nothing .
to the handicapped .
sorry .
the first time i heard hear no evil ... ... i was like , you know , " whatever .
but then max told me frankie's story ... ... and the penny dropped .
people love a good tragedy .
people love handicaps , frankly .
it gets them emotional , you know .
so i'll get on that deaf train with a wheelchair ramp .
no problem .
first class ticket , please .
i don't see why we should limit ourselves to deaf people , really .
i don't want to reveal too much either ... ... about where we're going .
but it's gonna be big .
it's gonna be big , and it's gonna be handicapped .
imagine all the deaf people , all the deaf people in the world .
imagine all the deaf people , all the deaf people in the world .
they need a fucking hero , frank .
they don't have a fucking hero .
there's no deaf hero , huh?
it's you , frank .
you're , like , the fucking link .
you're drawing all the deaf kids that are screaming , with no hearing .
they're yelling out to ...
who's gonna listen?
not other fucking deaf kids .
they can't hear , huh?
you .
you're the fucking voice , eh?
and wait .
wait .
you're gonna love this .
can you hear me?
no , i can't hear you , max .
are you trying to make me money?
yes .
i'm making you money .
okay .
fuck , look ... ... that is just the fucking beginning .
i wouldn't put my name to any old product .
if i could describe it ... ... as bad speed in a can .
we've all had bad speed , haven't we?
i'm just gonna have a sip .
i can't resist .
fuck .
he made disabilities cool .
what's with the fucking ear?
the ear , that represents your deafness , okay .
deaf people hate their ears , see .
don't they?
see?
so it's symbolic .
so you're gonna smash it .
the deaf kids are gonna go fucking nuts .
don't actually hit the ear ... ... because i'll put some glass on that and turn that into a table .
it's wank .
i'm sucking deaf cock for you , mate ... ... and i'm fucking choking on it .
all right , first off , okay ... ... you're sucking show biz cock .
but look , this is gonna be good money .
this is all about cash .
shitloads of cash , frank .
and better than that ... ... sonya can't get her grubby fingers on this fucking money , understand?
this is sonya free cash .
he's not a whore !
look , frank , okay?
you're not giving me any fucking positive feedback .
i need fucking ...
you know what really fucking bothers me about you?
the fact that you think art just fucking happens .
it's just free .
like these people just took out ... ... time from their fucking day to come down here ... ... and do a bunch of shit for nothing .
what you gotta realize ... ... is you're a hero .
that's what the yellow's about .
you make fun of me on that jacket .
i picked that jacket .
deaf kids all over the world are gonna see that yellow .
they'll run out , they'll buy that jacket .
two , maybe $300 .
they're gonna run around , proudly deaf ... ... all just yellow , fluorescently deaf ...
sit down .
charlize bondo , ibiza beat .
frankie , can you really dj as a deaf man?
how is that possible?
they murmuring?
yeah , quite a bit .
i'm an honest man .
and i can tell you that this album was made ... ... completely without the aid of my ears .
and at pacha next week , i'll be dj'ing as a deaf man .
and if you don't believe me ... ... you know , fuck you ... ... because i've got nothing , nothing to prove ... ... to you sluts at all .
okay .
okay .
role model .
nothing .
wait a minute .
okay , role model .
listen .
listen to me .
no .
no .
he loves sluts .
frank loves sluts .
now , i think what he's trying to say is ... ... even though he feels he has nothing to prove to you ... ... he'd be happy to prove anything you want , to you .
it's important that we all realize that this is a major comeback from a rock .
you know , what he's accomplished in the last few months is astonishing .
he'll be at the pacha nightclub .
you can come down ... ... and watch him mix yourself ... ... and watch the miracle happen , okay?
because , you know , i realize , okay , that there are doubters in this room ... ... which fucks me up .
because , you know ... ... why would someone pretend to be deaf?
i mean , that's retarded .
that's ridic ...
it's not like he's fucking benefiting from this .
it's a fucking obstacle .
he can't hear a fuck ...
your mom's a cunt .
nothing .
zero .
blank .
this man , what he's done , fucking ...
it gets me in my fucking heart , what he's done .
and you ...
you come down here , and you put on this big fucking show ... ... like he's gonna fucking make shit up !
relax .
relax , man .
all right .
next question .
one more !
one more !
i thought it was amazing , you know , that somebody ... ... that's deaf can actually ...
can actually ... ... you know , be a dj .
frankie wilde , good luck .
good luck .
i just think that guy is so fantastic .
he has a gift that no one else has .
and somehow , he is gonna do it .
frankie !
frankie !
frankie !

he just had clubland sparking , bigtime .

i've heard a story that he's running a record shop in oxford .
there's a story that he went to fiji and then died of syphilis .
but nobody knows .
you know , i don't know where he is .
he was another deaf guy with a deaf guy's needs .
and he went off ... ... to a quiet place .
although , i suppose that wouldn't make much difference .
