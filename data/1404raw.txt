neighbors heard them screaming at each other ...
like , for two hours .
nothing new .
then they heard the gun go off , both barrels .
crime of passion .
just look at all the passion on that wall .
well , it's a done deal , all but the paperwork .
the kid see it?
what?
the kid .
what kind of fucking question is that?
we are all going to be real glad ... when we get rid of you , somerset .
it's always these questions with you .
did the kid see it?
who gives a fuck?
he's dead .
his wife killed him .
anything else , it has nothing to do with us .
detective somerset?
i'm detective mills .
lieutenant , i apologize for interrupting .
i get in town 20 minutes ago , they dump me here .
look , mills?
i thought we might find a bar someplace .
i'd like to get to the precinct , if it's all the same .
not much time for this transition thing .
i meant to ask you something ... when we spoke on the phone before .
why here?
i don't follow .
well , all this effort to get transferred .
it's the first question that popped into my head .
i guess the same reasons as you had ... before you decided to quit , yeah?
you just met me .
maybe i'm not understanding the question .
it's very simple .
you actually fought to get reassigned here .
i've just never seen it done that way before .
i thought i could do some good .
it would be greatfor me if we didn't start out ... kicking each other in the balls .
but you're calling the shots , lieutenant .
yes .
i want you to look , and i want you to listen .
i wasn't guarding the taco bell .
i've worked homicide five years .
not here .
i understand that .
over the next seven days , detective ... you'll do me the favor of remembering that .
say it again .
i thought we moved here to get away from tractor pulls .
serpico's got to go .
you might want to get rid of this little crusty eye , serpico .
did you get it?
got it .
good .
coffee?
no?
nothing's been touched .
everything's like i found it .
what time was death established?
like i said , i didn't touch anything ... but he's got his face in a plate of spaghetti ... for about forty five minutes now .
no one bothers with vital signs?
did i stutter?
this guy ain't breathing ... unless he started breathing spaghetti sauce .
so that's how it's done around here?
i beg your pardon , detective ... this guy's sitting in a pile of his own piss and shit .
if he wasn't dead , he would have stood up by now .
thank you , officer .
thank you .
i wonder ...
what exactly was the point ... of the conversation you were about to get into?
don't know .
how many times has barney fife ... found dead bodies that weren't dead?
drop it .
somebody phone guinness .
i think we've got a record here .
better homes and gardens .
who said this was murder?
no one .
his heart has got to be the size of a canned ham .
if this isn't a coronary ...
well , i don't know .
how about that?
we had this case once ... guy dead on the ground , knife in his back .
got to be murder , right?
fuck .
anyway , big insurance policy involved , yeah?
the guy took the tip of the blade ... stuck it in his own shoulder blades .
must've screwed up a few times .
there was multiples .
could you please be quiet?
wait a minute .
what?
got a bucket here .
what's in it?
oh , god !
fucking vomit .
any blood in it?
i didn't see any .
help yourself .
are you thinking it's poison?
oh , wonderful .
very moody .
are you thinking it's poison , somerset?
you girls have got forensics waiting outside .
i don't know if we'll all fit , though .
there's room .
light's the problem .
hi .
detective mills , would you go help the officers ... question the neighbors?
what?
send in forensics on your way out , please .
he's dead .
thank you , doctor .
you've seen my files , right?
you've seen what i've done .
well , i did my time walking the beat .
i did that shit for a long time .
and?
my badge says detective , the same as yours .
look , i made a decision .
i had to consider the integrity of the scene .
couldn't worry whether you thought ... you were getting enough time on the playing field .
hey , man ... just don't jerk me off .
that's all i ask .
don't jerk me off .
he's been dead a long time ... and i can tell you it was not a poison .
oh , man .
how does someone let themselves go like that?
it took four orderlies just to get him on the table .
but how'd the fat fuck ever fit out his front door?
please .
it's obvious he was a shut in .
look at this .
see how big this stomach is?
and the strange thing is stretches .
look at the size of the cardiac orifice ... where the food ...
i see , but that means nothing to me .
he's got lines of distention across the duodenum ... and the interior wall is ripped open .
this man ate till he burst?
he didn't really burst , not all the way ... but he was hemorrhaging internally .
there was a hematoma in the rectus .
so he did die by eating .
yes and no .
what about these bruises up here?
i haven't figured that out yet .
gun pressed against his head?
pressed hard enough , sure .
fuck , yeah .
marks from the front side flush with the muzzle .
ladies and gentlemen , we have ourselves a homicide .
killer put a bucket beneath him , kept on serving .
took his time , too .
coroner said this could've gone on more than twelve hours .
victim's throat was swollen , probably from the effort ... and there was definitely a point when he passed out .
the killer kicked him , and he burst .
sadistic fucker , huh?
when you want somebody dead , you drive by and shoot them .
you don't risk the time it takes to do this ... unless the act itself has meaning .
come on .
somebody had a problem with the fat boy ... and decided to torture him .
simple as that .
ln the grocery bags , we found two receipts .
that means the killer stopped in the middle ... and made a second trip to the supermarket .
so?
hey , man , it's his thing .
i've been out in the rain all day .
this is beginning .
we've got one dead guy , not three .
no motive .
don't even start your big brain cooking on this .
please .
i'd like to be reassigned .
what?
what in the hell are you talking about?
this can't be my last duty .
it's just going to go on and on .
you're retiring .
six more days and you're all the way gone .
won't be the first time you've left unfinished business .
those cases were taken as close to conclusion as possible ... and if i may speak freely ...
we're all friends here .
this should not be his first assignment .
come on !
i knew it .
this is not my first assignment , dick .
it's too soon for him .
i'm here .
you can say that shit to my face .
it's too soon .
captain , if we can just talk in private .
this isn't working .
it's a personal thing .
shut up , mills .
look .
i don't have anyone else to put on this .
this is metro .
you don't get to swap .
give it to me .
say what?
he doesn't want it , fuck him .
sorry .
see you later .
have a nice time .
give it to me .
no .
i'm putting you on something else .
go on , mills .
just go on .
i'm sorry , old buddy ... but it looks like you're stuck cleaning up the fat man .
all right .
here we go .
quiet down .
calm down .
calm down .
quiet down !
now , here's how it's going to be ...
i'll answer questions for ten minutes only .
if those questions do not come ... in a calm , sane , and orderly fashion ...
i'm on my way out .
detective?
can i have a moment of your time?
i will not discuss the details of this ongoing investigation ... so don't bother asking .
there he is .
that's the guy .
it looks like we won't be eating dinner .
who is this kid , anyway?
hotshot .
what have you guys gotfor me?
nothing yet , boss .
why don't you guys go get a coffee?
we have this breaking story for you .
we're going live downtown where defense attorney eli gould ... was found murdered this morning .
district attorney martin talbot is taking questions .
conflict of interest between your office ...
that is ridiculous to the point of being offensive .
there is no conflict whatsoever ... and any claim there could be is irresponsible .
ls it true you're far from apprehending a suspect?
i've come from a meeting of law enforcement officials ... and they've assured me their very best men are on this .
this will be the very definition of swift justice .
pardon me , george .
come in .
have you heard the news?
haven't heard .
eli gould was found murdered this morning .
someone broke into his law firm and bled him to death ... wrote the word " greed " on the floor .
greed?
ln blood .
mills is heading up the investigation .
excuse me .
could you not do that , please?
well , goodfor him .
what in the hell are you going to do with yourself ... out there , somerset?
i'll work , maybe on a farm , fix my house .
don't you feel that feeling?
you're not going to be a cop anymore .
that's the whole idea .
i don't think you're leaving .
hell , you can't leave all this .
a guy's out walking his dog , gets attacked .
his watch is taken , his wallet .
while he's lying there on the sidewalk helpless ... his attacker stabs him in both eyes .
this happened last night about four blocks from here .
i read about it .
i don't understand this place any longer .
it's the way it's always been .
maybe you're right .
you do this work , you were made for it ... and i don't think you can deny that .
maybe i'm wrong .
the coroner sent this down for you .
found them in the fat boy's stomach mixed with the food .
looks like plastic .
set them on the desk , please .
they were fed to him .
oh , lord .
this was found on the wall behind the refrigerator ... at the obesity murder scene .
long is the way and hard ...
that out of hell leads up to light .
it's from milton .
paradise lost .
all right .
i'm confused .
it means that this is beginning .
this was found behind the same refrigerator ... written in grease .
there are seven deadly sins , captain .
gluttony ... greed ... sloth , wrath , pride , lust ... and envy .
seven .
hold on .
this is not even my desk .
you can expect five more of these .
now wait a minute .
i can't get involved in this .
he wanted it .
damn .
i'm all over it .
where you headed?
far away from here .
thanks , george .
how you doing?
i've got a few things to look up .
sit where you'd like .
how's everybody?
hi there , smiley .
come on , george .
your cards are getting cold .
duty calls .
gentlemen , gentlemen .
i'll never understand .
all these books ... a world of knowledge at yourfingertips .
what do you do?
play poker all night .
we got culture !
we got culture coming out our ass .
all right !
how's this for culture?
smiley , you really going to miss us .
i just might .
fucking dante .
goddamned poetry rhyming faggot piece of shit !
fucker !
good work , officer .
thank you , lord .
sorry .
be out of your way in a second .
you want your chair?
no .
you go right ahead .
phone .
it's a package deal .
it comes with the office .
are you ok?
ls something wrong?
you dingleberry .
i told you not to call me at work .
yeah .
why?
why?
it's my wife .
sorry?
she'd like to speak to you .
this is detective somerset .
well , it's nice to talk to you , too .
i appreciate the offer , but ...
well , in that case , i'd be delighted .
yes , thank you very much .
hon , what ...
well?
sorry?
i've been invited to a late supper at your apartment .
i accepted .
how's that?
tonight .
hello , men .
hi , loser .
hi , idiot .
this is tracy .
tracy , somerset .
happy to meet you .
i've heard a lot about you .
except , of course , your first name .
it's william .
it's a good name , william .
william , i'd like you to meet david .
david , this is william .
i'll be right back .
how are the kids?
good .
they're in their room .
come on in .
oh , good dogs !
how are you?
smells good .
what?
the ...
yeah .
i mean , thank you .
please , have a seat .
would you like something to drink?
no, thanks .
i'll wait .
just throw that anywhere .
excuse all this mess .
we're still unpacking .
i understand you two were high school sweethearts .
pretty hokey , huh?
you know something?
i knew on ourfirst date i was going to marry him .
really?
he was the funniest guy i'd ever met .
really?
well , it's kind of rare nowadays , you know ... that level of commitment .
don't worry .
i won't wear it to the dinner table .
i ...
no matter how often i see guns ...
i can't get used to them .
same here .
why aren't you married , william?
trace .
what the hell?
i was close once .
just didn't happen .
it surprises me .
it really does .
anyone who spends a significant amount of time with me ... finds me disagreeable .
ask your husband .
very , very true .
so how long have you lived here?
too long .
how are you liking it?
you know , takes time to settle in .
it'll be good .
you get numb after a while .
there are things to any city ...
the subway .
it'll go away in a minute .
it's nothing .
that real estate guy .
fucking piece of ...
sorry , hon .
shows us the place a few times .
i think it's good .
trace likes it .
then i start wondering why he only brings us here ... five minutes at a time .
we found out the first night .
the soothing , relaxing , vibrating home , huh?
i'm sorry .
all right , laugh it up .
i don't know what you're laughing at .
all right already .
the guy had to get into the building ... before the office was closed and security tightened .
gould would have been working late .
i'm certain .
biggest defense lawyer in town .
lnfamous , really .
the body was found tuesday morning .
the office was closed monday .
the guy could have gotten in on friday ...
laid low till the cleaning crew left ... and had his way all day saturday , sunday , maybe monday .
look at this .
gould was bound , his right arm free .
he was handed a butcher's knife .
check out the scale .
a pound of flesh?
one pound of flesh , no more , no less .
no cartilage , no bone , but only flesh .
merchant of venice .
didn't see it .
his task done , then he would go free .
that chair was soaked with sweat .
of course .
the killer would have wanted gould to take his time ... to sit and decide which cut to make first .
lmagine it there's a gun in yourface .
which part of your body is expendable?
how about the love handle?
cut along the side of his own stomach .
let's take a fresh look at these .
even though the corpse is there , look through it .
edit out the initial shock .
the trick is to find one item , one detail ... and focus on it until it's an exhausted possibility .
i'm going to get another beer .
beer?
wine , please .
he's preaching .
he's punishing .
the sins were used in medieval sermons .
there were seven cardinal virtues ... and seven deadly sins used as teaching tools .
like in " the parson's tale , " and what's his ...
dante .
you read them .
parts .
remember in " purgatory , " dante and his buddy ... they're climbing up the hill , checking out the sinners?
yeah .
the seven terraces of purgation .
right , but pride comes first , not gluttony .
let's consider that the books were the inspiration .
the sermons were about atonementfor sin .
these murders are like forced attrition .
forced what?
attrition .
when you regret your sins but not because you love god .
because someone's sticking a fucking gun in yourface .
no fingerprints .
totally unrelated victims .
and no witnesses of any kind .
which i don't get because the fucker had to get back out .
ln any major city , minding your own business is a science .
first thing they teach women in rape prevention ... is never cry for help .
always yell " fire .
nobody answers " help .
holler " fire , " they come running .
that's fucked up .
must have left another puzzle piece .
know what?
thank you for talking this out ... but i got to sleep , walk the dogs .
this is to satisfy my curiosity .
i'm still leaving at the end of the week .
shit .
wait .
gould's wife was out of town ... except this means she saw something .
what if it's a threat?
i put her in a safe house .
she wasn't happy about it .
what if it isn't something she has seen ... but something she's supposed to see ... but hasn't been given a chance?
what?
i don't know .
but that's the one thing .
sign us in .
we've got to see mrs. gould .
we want you to have a phone line , but ...
mrs. gould?
mrs. gould , i am sorry .
i truly am .
i don't understand .
i need you to look at each photo very carefully .
see if there's anything strange or out of place ... anything at all .
i don't see anything .
you sure?
please , i can't do this right now !
it's got to be now .
there may be something we haven't seen .
wait .
what?
here .
this painting is upside down .
you sure your men didn't move this?
no .
those shots were taken before forensics .
nothing .
there's got to be something .
moved the screws to rehang it .
what the fuck is that?
switchblade .
god damn it !
must be something .
he didn't paint the fucking thing .
now he's fucking with us .
that's what he's doing .
see this?
this is us .
just wait a minute .
now somerset's climbing on the furniture .
just wait a minute .
you're kidding me .
call the print lab .
