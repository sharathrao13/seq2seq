we will give you five minutes to leave this area .
who is the heavyweight champion of the world?
what's happenin '?
hey , man .
we lost on the appellate level ... in new orleans .
we'reheading to the supreme court .
we already got turned down there .
i'm petitioning on a conscientious objection basis .
religious belief .
i believe that they'll hear that .
where the money gonna come from , chauncey?
herbert say i'm runnin'on empty .
now , just put aside ...
how did that happen?
license all revoked , passport gone , can't fight here , can't fight nowhere .
then what happen ifl lose at the supreme court?
then you go tojail for fiveyears .
oh , i saw bundini when i was in europe .
yeah?
how is he?
he's bad .
he's in bad shape , man .
you better get your belt back
look at this .
joe frazier .
he can't up no gate .
can't fill no arena .
they got to let me fight .
fight .
if that happens , promise me you'll put some new people around you .
what you talkin 'about?
where herbert and them when we need 'em?
gene kilroy's dropping off groceries like charity .
we borrow money from my folks .
they're all overyou when you got it , and then they just drop off you ... when you don't .
norton , he's big and strong , but he ain't nothin '.
hold on a second , joe .
they're telling me we have a caller .
go ahead , please .
cosell , this is muhammad ali .
it's muhammad ali .
everybody knows that i am the champ .
the crown is a lie .
i know it's a lie .
joe frazier knows it's a lie .
and it's time for everybody to stop lying and tell the truth .
let's tell it like it is .
with your court and boxing problems ... can you get a fight promoted?
i would fight joe frazier for free in a phone booth ... in the middle of times square if i wasn't broke .
did you say you were broke?
how can you be broke?
you made more money than all previous heavyweights champions combined .
what about your management?
surely they have provided for you .
all i'm trying to say is it's time for everybody to stop lyin '.
muhammad ali is the champ .
get my son herbert on the telephone .
muhammad , thank you for calling in .
i'll relay that to joe .
and tell joe i said he is very ugly .
muhammad says that he will fight you anywhere , anytime ... and that the championship really is his until that battle ensues .
mr. ali has sporting blood .
mr. ali wants a place in this sports world .
he loves it too much .
i am therefore suspending mr. ali from the practice of islam .
he may no longer appear in temple , pray or teach ... or have any conversation with any muslim whatsoever .
why didn? t you call an ambulance or a doctor?
because he gave me your number when he checked in .
normally , he's up there making a lot of noise .
but now he hasn't answered the door in three days .
what's that?
it's daylight .
get me that short dog .
give it to me .
what's wrong with you?
ain't nothin 'wrong with me .
my head ain't bad .
leave me alone .
leave you alone .
you called me !
yes , but that was a week ago .
why are you shamin 'yourself?
let me go , man .
why you doin 'that to yourself?
why you shamin 'yourself?
ain't nobody shamed .
ain't nothin 'wrong with me .
i'm flyin '.
the sky chief talk through me .
i know the word .
you know low .
yeah?
i know low where the king is goin 'back to his throne !
from the root to the fruit !
them rhymes is old , bundini .
you need to get some new ones .
god don't care about you .
don't care about me .
in all of everything , we don't mean nothin '.
he don't owe us .
we be .
and that's the onliest thing he did .
but that's good .
that's why we free .
but free ain't easy .
free is real and real is a motherfucker .
it eats raw meat .
it walk in its own shoes .
it don't ever waiver .
yeah .
i i sold your belt .
i sold your belt to a barber for $500 on lenox avenue .
that's how low i did you .
i couldn't help it .
i got a crazy mind .
that belt say you the heavyweight boxing champion of the world ... and i took that $500 ... and i put it in my arm .
that's what i called to tell you .
i heard about the nation stuff , the courtroom .
what you gonna do?
take me back .
i could go down there and get the belt .
i can go get the belt .
hey , champ .
$1 , 000 to the man that bring me howard cosell's toupee dead or alive !
don't bother me .
i'm a world famous sportscaster ... and you're an ex champion with diminished skills .
i can't be seen with you .
how's it goin ', champ?
pretty good , man .
muhammad , i'd do anything for you .
you know that .
but i've got bosses who only give a damn about nielsen ratings .
i guarantee ... it will be a historical and a momentous night .
if they came to me tomorrow and say , " we want you to fight joe frazier .
madison square garden .
millions and millions of dollars .
here's your license back .
i will tell them ...
i will never fight again .
frankly , muhammad , i'm surprised , because unless you or until you fight frazier
cosell , are you losin 'your hearing along with your hair?
don't put no question to it , man .
i done told you , i'm through fightin '.
i got a much bigger contender , a much heavier opponent .
i'm fightin 'the entire us government .
do you think you're going to jail?
i don't know .
i don't know .
joe frazier told me on this show that he could knock you out .
see , there you go agitatin '.
you should've asked smokin 'joe what have he been smokin '?
that boy even dream he whupped me , he better wake up and apologize .
if i was to get in the ring with joe ... here's what you might see .
ali comes out to meet frazier , but frazier starts to retreat .
if joe goes back an inch farther , he'll wind up in a ringside seat .
ali swings with his left , ali swings with his right .
just look at the kid carry the fight .
frazier keeps backin ', but there's not enough room .
it's only a matter of time before ali lowers the boom .
ali swings with his right .
what a beautiful swing .
but the punch lifts frazier clean out of the ring .
frazier's still risin ', and the referee wears a frown ...
'cause he can't start countin 'till frazier comes down .
frazier's disappeared from view .
the crowd is getting frantic .
but our radar stations picked him up .
he's somewhere over the atlantic .
now , who would've thought when they came to the fight ... they was gonna witness the launchin 'of a black satellite .
but don't wait for that fight .
it ain't never gonna happen .
only thing you could do ... is wonder and imagine .
this has been another sports exclusive from abc .
two .
go two .
over to jim mckay ... in bern , switzerland .
how you gonna go from me to jim mckay?
listen , uh
did your wife leave you yet?
no , she hasn't left me yet .
she's going to , 'cause i told your wife when i seen her ...
i said , " listen , why you doin 'this to yourself?
oh , man , joe .
who dresses you?
you look like the heavyweight champion of pimps .
hey , shut up and get in .
that jacket? s a mess , man .
what you in philly for?
philly's my town .
well , i just wanted to get a little closer to you , honey .
man , fuck you .
there'll be two undefeated heavyweight champions , and they ain't fightin '.
what about your license?
i can fight in atlanta .
there ain't no state boxing commission in georgia .
it's all set .
i do a prelim in atlanta against jerry quary ... but we got to get this steamroller movin 'right now .

joe done run outta tomato cans ...
i got yank to commit to a rematch with you in about six months .
frazier said he'd be happy with three mil .
i'll fly to jamaica , get yank to sign right after joe beats this big stiff .
i think he hurt joe frazier .
i think joe is hurt .
down goes frazier !
down goes frazier !
down goes frazier !
get up , joe .
the heavy weight champion is taking the mandatory eightcount ... and foreman i spoised as can be .
foreman is all over frazier .
and frazier is down again !
he maybe no , he's rising .
it's over !
it is over !
it'd be easy to get a fight with frazier now .
only thing he's champion of is gettin 'knocked down .
george foreman is the heavyweight champion of the world .
the rumble in the jungle .
that is the name that i've given it .
muhammad ali and george foreman in kinshasa , zaire .
don , zaire?
yeah , don .
i mean , why not antarctica , somethin 'like that?
what's wrong with new york city?
because you miss the significance .
see , i dream of overcoming 400 years of racial depression ... to the dawn of a new day of liberation , financial and otherwise .
it will raise up the spirits of our inner cities .
it will rise up and fill with hope , the souls ... the unrequited needs of the black proletariat .
that is , the discouraged , dispirited , denigrated denizens ... of the demimonde that is called the ghetto .
man , don , you crazy .
you must've studied the whole " d " section of the dictionary .
good morning , sister .
hi , brother .
how you doin ', champ?
why they saying that?
what they sayin '?
what that mean?
i don't understand .
it means  what?
it mean , " ali , kill him .
ali , kill him .
the champ is here !
ladies and gentlemen , the heavyweight champion of the world has arrived !
the champ is here !
hey , man .
he's quite younger than you .
how you feeling about that?
he's quite younger than me?
well , we quite younger than you .
what you talkin 'about?
thirty two years old .
best shape of my life .
hey , stop !
all right , back up .
did you see muhammad ali?
here's your water .
oh , thank you , hon .
bottled water .
frozen steaks .
brought all that stuffin like africa's ain't got no steaks .
you could pick up parasites .
mobutu eats it .
mobutu's takin 'care of mobutu .
he steals all the wealth and sends it to switzerland .
what that got to do with any of why we here?
we are here 'cause don king got mobutu to put up $1 0 million .
don king don't care about africa .
he's worse than herbert .
here come herbert .
and don king fit right in too .
now he's a dashiki wearin 'rip off .
don king delivered the first ever ... black promoted championship fight in africa .
don king talks black , lives white and thinks green .
and you're defending him and brother herbert?
'cause clean cut muslims in a parade on the south side of chicago ... ain't gonna get this done !
i got to put honkies with connections and bad ass niggas to it .
and now they matched you up against george foreman .
do you think they give a damn if you get killed?
so that's what you think?
i just wanna know why my muslim husband ... is allowing himself to get strung up on a cross .
just tell me why .
mayum's sick .
maybe i ought to go back to chicago and look after her?
sure .
well , then i guess i'll be back before the fight .
if that? s all right , my husband .
this fight is no contest !
he is entirely too slow to fight me .
i say that george foreman is a mummy .
he's too slow .
you know i name all my fighters .
i'm gonna call george foreman " the mummy .
he fight like a mummy .
here come the left .
here come the right .
but the mummy can't hit what the mummy can't see ...
'cause i'm too fast for him .
i'm too fast .
i'm too fast .
i'm too fast .
i move too good for him .
i'll hit george foreman so many times , he'll think he's surrounded .
he gonna say , " call the police !
it's five of 'em in here !
i'm bad , man .
i'm bad !
muhammad , i'm sorry .
i have to ask .
are you really fast enough anymore ... to beat george foreman?
if he gets you against the ropes , he can knock you out with either hand .
many people believe you? re not the man you used to be ten years ago .
see , now , howard ...
i didn't even want to talk about this , man .
especially not out here in front of all these people .
but i talked to your wife ... and she said you not the man you used to be two years ago !
champ .
champ , george had an accident .
he he had what?
what are you talking about?
he got cut right above his right eye .
his sparring partner's elbow split it open .
can he fight?
not for six weeks .
this is not a humorous situation , my champ .
this postponement could be long , especially if george leaves .
you tying to pull something here , don?
if george leaves , he ain't comin 'back .
george don't like it here .
how right you are , my suspicious and short italian brother .
look here , man , my fiduciary responsibility ... to this first all black promotion ... is analogous to a garden in the african sun it must grow , it must bloom .
cannot flower in the gloom and shade of postponement to the astrodome ... or any dome out of zaire where it be deprivileged of light and bled of water .
'cause what gonna be bleedin 'out of there is money a hemorrhage of cash .
i'm talkin 'about blood on the floor .
double hotel costs , airplane , travel costs , food and beverage .
so what do you want us to do?
muhammad ali .
the people's champion .
my black brother .
i need you .
i need your strength .
i need you to find a way to get george to stay .
be moses in reverse .
do not let my people go .
keep them the fuck right here in egypt .
if you? il pardon my swahili .
lingala .
say what?
they speak lingala .
ali wants his title , and he wants it in zaire .
okay , all right , okay .
let's take it back .
george go , george go .
hell , i can get you joe frazier .
ali frazier 3 .
that's the fight everybody want to see .
we don't want frazier , we want george .
hell , i don't control george foreman .
there's been an accidental injury to george foreman in training .
the truth is ...
george knocked his self out .
that's right .
he did three rounds , realized he was gonna lose to muhammad ali ... and knocked his self out .
i predict that when the fight is set , he might not show .
oh , you bad .
that's right , i'm a bad man .
ain't no doubt about that .
yeah , but you tell george the same thing .
i heard you .
i been watching you .
i know he's your man , i know you got him picked , but the man is in trouble .
the whole world was gonna know , but now he ain't gonna show .
in order to ensure that george is ready , we are thinking of postponing ... from september 24 to october 30 .
what about the concert?
the concert will go on as planned .
those dates are september 20 , 21
i want all the helicopters guarded , all the private planes , private boats .
i'm serious .
i want the airports
i want president mobutu and all his paratroopers
all you zaireans , y'all be on guard too .
any strange boats creeping away , they might be taking him out .
bus stations .
and bus stations !
right .
watch the bus stations .
the elephant caravans they might be tying to take him out on an elephant .
what'd you say?
hell , i ain't talking to you .
hey .
hey , man .
don? t you never talk to angelo like that .
don? t you never talk to angie like that again .
something wrong with you , man?

you ain't callin 'nothin '.
they all know .
all them ladies out there , they know i'm ready .
i see fear in the eyes of his followers .
this was supposed to be the fight that muhammad ali was ended .
supposed to be muhammad was gonna fall .
supposed to be my destruction .

they misjudged .
they got it wrong .
