but i think the color rendition is pretty damn accurate .
batteries are in the base .
two minutes maximum .
you're good .
it's good , roman .
you're a genius .
i think i am .
you'd have never got past that grid .
that's why you're paying me double .
what?
no , no , no .
you got my message .
who's that sexy phone voice?
early bond .
what message?
the message i left with sexy phone voice nicole .
on your mobile .

two days ago .
she had your phone .

yeah .
well , you better ...
yeah .
that's great .
i mean ...
so ...?
so who's got my money?
who has got my bloody money?
jesus .
sorry to hear about your mom .
she was an amazing ... well , i thought so , at least .
she hated you .
i should've picked up on that .
she hated all thieves .
no wonder you fought .
excuse me?
may i have my phone back?
no .
that's a nice pull , by the way .
thanks .
did you get that tingling sensation down your spine when you did it?
or is that none of my business?
you considered a career change?
have you?
i tried hotels .
i'm better at this .
went by the caf for some tiramisu .
it wasn't the same .
who's the night fox?
they did something to the eggs .
why accept his challenge?
because he'll lose .
and how can you beat him?
we can't .
you're not making any sense .
okay .
the bulgari job you pulled with frank when we were together ... ... i knew it was you .
why didn't you say something?
why didn't you ... ... robert?
i didn't want it to end .
you assumed it would .
was i wrong?
you shouldn't be here .
i have a meeting .
someone stole a whole bunch of paintings in lake como .
interesting .
any leads?
the next time i see you ... ... l'm arresting you .
and ocean and anybody else i recognize .
fair enough .
ready?
right .
yes , of course i do .
my blue dancers , my degas .
they took it , unfortunately , and i really would like ...
do you have any enemies?
anybody out there who would feel wronged by you?
no .
i can't see anyone .
but why?
you think ...
you think maybe the thief ... ... is trying to harm me personally now?
well , i assumed he was after the paintings themselves .
i think it's enough .
ready?
good?
i have something you might be interested in .
it's a dvd with all the hidden surveillance cameras i have to my place .
it's plenty .
i haven't checked it out yet .
maybe the thieves have been careless enough to be photographed .
i doubt it , this level of thief , but i'll take a look .
yeah .
you never know .
okay .
well , merci .
thank you , mademoiselle lahiri , for everything .
thank you .
goodbye .
goodbye .
mademoiselle lahiri .
did you get the faxed copy of the 1077?
good .
a dozen ...
twelve uniformed officers .
metal detectors , extra cameras .
so i'll e mail you the photographs .
do you happen to have a pen?
i'll just give you the names .
okay .
livingston dell , male , caucasian , 5'6 " , 150 pounds .
virgil malloy , male , caucasian , 5 '10 " , 160 pounds .
robert ryan , male , caucasian ...
hello?
buon giorno , mr. eisenhower .
this is your 5 a . m .
wake up call .
really?
yes , i'm afraid .
have a nice day , sir .
hey .
what are you doing?
what ...?
sleeping .
why are you dressed?
it's 5 : 30 , day of .
we gotta go .
let's go .
it's 11 : 30 .
the night before .
but ...
oh , he's mean .
he's just mean spirited .
how many espressos did you have?
five .
yeah , come on .
i don't know if she's just confused ... ... or she's really turned the corner and hates me now .
you think i handled this wrong?
i was too forceful .
i was too american .
she's different .
maybe you're right , maybe she has moved on .
you know , i talked to a doctor about getting that tattoo removed .
but given its location , he advised against it .
that guy doing potsie is unbelievable .
i mean , what's this guy's problem?
he's stitched us up twice in two weeks , all over his ego .
it's the first decent evening we've had together in i don't know how long .
all right , all right , let's just stay on point here .
let's go over the list again .
who died and made you danny?
no one .
i'm sorry .
my emotions are all over the place .
i was forceful , trying to show good leadership ...
for fuck's sake .
let's go .
you're a good leader .
thanks .
all right , well , let's go over the list again .
swinging priest?
not enough people .
crazy larry?
not enough people .
soft shoulder?
not enough people .
baker's dozen?
no woman and not enough people .
hell in a handbasket?
we can't train a cat that quickly .
and not enough people .
what about tess?
what about her?
well , you know how she kind of looks like ...
so what?
yeah , what's your point?
so we do a lookie loo .
it's a lookie loo with a bundle of joy .
a lookie loo with tess ... ... and a bundle of joy?
you've gone right out of your tree , my son .
he's mad .
it's crazy .
it's italian television crazy , and we're still one short .
no , think about it .
she can get near the egg during daylight with half the system down .
i mean , that's a trifecta .
he might be right .
make the calls .
linus caldwell , you are not following the procedures ... ... danny talked about if terry benedict shows up .
something is wrong .
what is wrong?
danny's fine .
he's with rusty .
during this part of the plan , they can't communicate with us .
promise he isn't hurt .
i promise he isn't hurt .
you're gonna miss the deadline .
danny would be thrilled if you met him in rome when the job's finished .
he misses you like crazy .
plus , you studied art , so i know how much you love rome .
there's no downside here .
wow , they're bringing you along fast , aren't they?
yes .
danny would be more thrilled ... ... if you were on the 7 p . m .
out of jfk , which means you have to leave right now .
i thought i'd requested a midsize .
danny here?
he wanted to be .
did you have a nice flight?
we weren't sure if you were a window or aisle person .
how long's danny been in jail?
just a couple of days , really .
which , you know , on the bright side , he's completely safe from benedict .
he told me everything was fine .
he lied right to me .
what i think he meant by " fine " is we're running low on time and money ... ... and we're deeper in debt than when we started .
i assume that you have a plan to get him out .
actually , she sounds like her .
no , she needs a southern accent .
can you do a southern ...?
what the hell is going on with you guys?
not quite .
the accent is crucial .
it's the first thing people notice .
this ridiculous car , what is it doing?
okay , i'm sorry .
all right , i'm just gonna level with you .
due to certain personnel losses ... ... that we have sustained ... ... we're ... various readjustments had to be made .
you're gonna have to play a small role in this thing .
okay?
so can you put these on?
i'd like you to put this hat on .
you're gonna put on that , and you're gonna stuff it with that .
and we'll turn around , just give you a little moment .
small role .
who am i supposed to be?
well ...
oh , really?
well , absolutely .
i can have ... we can make the suite available .
no , no , no trouble at all .
i mean , we would love ... we are honored that she would think of us again .
okay .
okay .
thank you .
bye .
how is this going to get danny out?
we needed someone famous .
why didn't you get someone famous?
just think four weddings and a funeral .
she wasn't in four weddings and a funeral .
i. " " i wasn't in four weddings and a funeral .
just protect your fake baby .
i'm hyperventilating .
welcome back , signora roberts .
thank you .
she's very tired .
take it .
take it .
okay .
oh , let's hide .
let's hide .
julia?
my name is teresa .
i thought i saw a friend of mine , someone that i know .
no , absolutely not .
you can't turn off the pressure sensors .
no .
well , she can't touch it .
she's a movie star .
she's not the pope , for chrissake .
you're from smyrna , georgia .
you were born in 1967 .
you like croquet and knitting .
your middle name is fiona .
you've got 10 dogs , seven horses .
your favorite color is peach .
she doesn't have more horses than dogs .
i can't do this .
i can't .
tess , we're out of time .
" julia , " please .
julia .
no , we understand you're feeling insecure .
that is totally natural .
you're playing an actress .
they're insecure .
no , i'm not insecure .
i'm freaking out .
yes .
that's right .
brilliant !
you're playing a role .
no , you're playing a role .
i'm apparently playing a real person .
yeah , so?
it's just wrong .
you mean , like , morally?
no .
well , yes .
probably ...
it's not the point .
the point is you want me to speak ... ... for someone who's out there somewhere .
it's too personal .
more personal than your husband doing 25 to life?
he won't do 25 to life .
benedict will have him killed immediately .
don't .
i'm sorry , that was stupid .
we're gonna be in and out in 10 minutes .
we have to .
that's our time frame .
you don't even have to talk .
give them a big smile , wave at the cameras .
that's all she ever does .
but if you do say something ... ... don't forget your accent .
drop your g's , and longer vowels .
room service .
it's gonna be fine .
you've gotta remember something .
you are an image to these people .
you're like an object .
nobody actually knows you .
the last thing this is gonna be is personal .
aren't you overdue?
why are you in rome?
i'm here on vacation .
i love you .
you are not supposed to fly eight months pregnant .
i know .
is danny here?
of course .
danny .
no , no , i mean , he has ...
he's working?
yes .
yes and no .
he's working .
in rome?
bruce .
glen snackwell , publicity .
hey , glen .
i'm a big fan .
thanks .
great .
you fired marcy?
you fired marcy .
two weeks ago , you told me i should go with marcy .
i'm sorry .
tell him what happened with marcy , glen .
there's a story?
always a story with marcy .
marcy ...
marcy ...
you look fantastic .
such a surprise .
you should sit down .
i'm with the studio .
marcy's still very much in the picture .
i just wanted to get you for a second .
we're looking to come off this baby thing strong .
you know , that little statue on the mantle starts smirking at you after a while .
you know what i'm saying?
not really , glen , no .
sorry .
yeah .
hey , jules , that reminds me .
i've been meaning to call you since the girls and i were in taos .
it's so good to see you .
come here .
these are a mess .
anyway , tallulah left her spongebob blanket in the red casita .
okay .
so , what i wanna do ...
here .
thank you .
you're welcome .
thanks , bruce .
is call marcus ... ... and have him get ahold of louise so we can make arrangements to get it .
he's home now , right?
marcus ...
i need to talk to marcus .
that's so funny .
what a coincidence .
go ahead .
talk to him .
over by the window , with the reception .
hello?
hello , marcus?
no , it's julia .
who's this?
it's julia .
i'm with bruce willis .
you're with bruce right now?
can i speak with him?
oh , yes , tallulah's spongebob .
i'm sorry , can i talk to him for a sec?
did it drop out?
yes , it fell out .
that's been happening all week .
put that phone away right now .
what?
hang it up and put it away .
do you have any idea how vulnerable ... ... a fetus 'brain is to the electromagnetic field created by your cell phone?
you might as well point a gun at her stomach .
i'm bruce willis .
simon leopold .
i am julia's physician .
he's a doctor .
what happened to dr. webber?
you know , doc ...?
he was sick .
dr. webber is on vacation .
well , he's sick .
he's sick on vacation .
sick on vacation .
don't you hate that?
sick on vacation .
sorry to have jumped on you , mr. willis .
you do very good actings .
thank you .
snackbar .
snackwell .
it doesn't matter .
if we are to get there at 4 : 00 and do that ...
i say 50 50 .
closer than that .
2 1 they don't make it to the museum .
5 1 they don't make it to the egg room .
what?
she's still my wife .
she's a novice .
you said so .
led by an apprentice .
being tracked by a pro .
you want her to win .
which her?
you know which her .
the one that started all this .
right .
good .
for a minute ...
why would i say that?
it's not her fault .
it wasn't .
okay , then .
good .
good .
i'm confused .
yeah , who are you talking about?
isabel .
tess .
i loved it , but i figured it out .
not a lot of people did .
that's amazing .
the second she doesn't ... ... talk to you in the restaurant , i knew ...
you figured that out .
yeah , i mean , the movie still works for me .
great .
can we just ...?
does she really need to be rushing this quickly?
she's practically jogging .
in thailand ... ... mothers routinely give birth in rice paddies and then go right back to work .
amazing women over there .
rice paddy?
she will not have it in a rice paddy .
she'll be at her own paddy .
and she will be very comfortable because she will be strong ... ... from this walk and this exercise .
was she worth it?
was tess?
the moment that she doesn't talk to you in the restaurant , i knew .
your friends didn't tell you?
no .
that's when you figured it out , huh?
yeah .
but the movie was still enjoyable for me .
okay .
thanks .
if everybody's so freaking smart , how come the movie did $675 million worldwide ... ... theatrical?
julia .
doctor .
doctor , you might wanna call the rice paddy now .
seal off the museum .
nobody in or out .
bring ...
bring it , bring it .
quickly , quickly .
sit her down .
sit her down .
everybody just relax .
can you hear me?
talk to me .
she is fine .
she is fine .
she's good?
okay , that's it .
we're done here .
no more pictures .
thank you , bruce willis .
just don't worry .
thank you , museum .
we are code four .
walk slowly , like you're doing .
we'll get you into the car as fast as we can .
okay , we're not stopping .
don't stop .
hello .
we're on our way out .
isabel lahiri , i'm with the museum .
it is so great to meet you .
we're very late .
i'm sorry , this won't take long .
i don't wanna be an annoying fan , but my boyfriend is such a huge fan .
i can't let you leave unless you sign something for him .
do you mind?
that's very unorthodox .
sorry , it won't take long .
what's his name?
his name's robert .
aren't you a lefty?
i thought you were a lefty .
she is a lefty .
often pregnant women become ambidextrous .
you are a big fan .
she doesn't necessarily have to sign lefty .
oh , thanks so much .
this is great .
okay .
we're on the move .
thank you .
you take care , now .
and one more thing .
i just got off the phone ... ... with someone called marcy who put you on a plane from taos , new mexico to l. a ... ... where you have a 1 : 00 meeting about a film , clowns can't sleep .
anyway , she just wanted me to let you know everyone's running a little late ... ... and was wondering if you could make it at 1 : 30 instead .
i knew it .
shame on you .
i don't think we've met .
bruce .
isabel lahiri .
nice to meet you .
do you really have a boyfriend?
or were you just ...?
was that just part of the whole thing with them?
so how'd it go?
you lahiri?
i'm section chief molly starr .
i spoke to a very nice man at europol this morning , commissioner greisman .
he wants you on the next flight to amsterdam .
there seems to be some irregularity with your paperwork .
that one .
let's start with that one .
imagine yourself in a room ... ... that's too short for you to stand up in and not wide enough for you to lie down in .
a room with no light , no heat ... ... and stone walls scratched by the teeth and nails of desperate men ... ... men driven crazy by isolation .
you will have rats for company ... ... and a small window that looks out on the world that has passed you by .
your parents will grow old and die , just like your dreams .
your friends will forget your name , tell your stories as their own ... ... because what good is a story when the person who owns it has vanished?
what do you want?
testify against the others ... ... in the benedict case .
the italian charges will be dropped .
you and the others will be extradited to the u. s. this afternoon .
plead , and you walk with parole .
i can't .
think about it , linus .
for a moment there , i was already forgetting your name .
wait .
just hang on a sec .
linus .
right .
thanks .
you okay?
well , i blew the meet with matsui .
matsui?
let me guess .
he pulled a lost in translation on you .
that's his idea of fun for first timers .
i mean ...
how do i not see these things?
don't get down on yourself .
obvious .
we talked about this .
i hope danny and rusty appreciate the job you did in a tight jam .
i am proud of you .
thanks .
we both are .
you ...?
you told dad?
i had to , sweetheart .
you told dad?
we were on vacation .
i'm sorry .
great .
thanks .
you're gonna be dining out on this one for months .
hey , remember the time your mom had to come to rome ...
i'm sorry .
every time with him .
it's like ...
it's like a ...
it's like a ...
that was for keeping me in the dark .
and that ...
that ... ... is for making me a master thief .
and that ...
okay . ... is for ruining our second third anniversary .
okay .
okay?
come here .
i'm sorry i kept you in the dark .
i'm sorry that i made you a thief .
master .
master thief .
and i'm very sorry that i ruined our second third anniversary .
okay?
okay .
you forgive me?
a little .
all right .
what was bruce willis like?
was he ...?
follow it .
that's ryan's car .
follow that one .
hey , wait , wait !
what the hell is going on?
your father's alive , lzzy .
your mom lied to you ... ... to keep you from him .
he's alive .
what are you talking about?
when they divorced , she told him if he contacted you , she'd go to the cops ... ... with everything to put him in jail .
how do you know that?
and why should i believe you?
i don't believe you , okay?
you know where he is?
i know somebody who does .
there's nothing back there but a forged 1077 .
no .
really?
no .
no .
that'd be horrible .
it's hard , you know , for dinners .
well , you must have very good contacts .
i hear it usually takes days to buy your way out .
tess , this is franois toulour .
madame ocean , at last .
hello .
he's french .
shouldn't you be somewhere else by now , like ... ... outer mongolia , maybe?
well , before we get to that , we just wanted to ask you one question .
what is that?
how'd you do it?
oh , so that's why you came .
you wanna know .
well , i guess that's normal .
but i got another deal for you .
you both recognize that i'm the best , and i'll tell you my secret .
yeah .
that ...
make it if you get him to tell us ... ... and tell him that he is the best .
oh , okay .
i won't tell him because you're the best .
all right .
thank you .
all right .
we'll tell you you're the best after you tell us how you did it .
how can i refuse a dying man's last request?
the egg arrived in rome at 6 : 45 p . m .
the saturday before it went on display .
it was at the museum by 8 p . m .
wait a minute , hold on .
you stole it that evening?
with the museum locked down?
how'd you get in the building?
how'd you get past the sensors?
why didn't my recon team see you?
don't touch my thing .
i didn't touch your thing .
like it works .
you got greasy hands , you put them on the lens .
now i can't see .
you can't see anything .
i see you .
you look like a retard .
you look like a retard .
i'll pay you a million dollars if you don't speak for a month .
one month .
i wanna eat your whole head .
go ahead .
a million dollars .
no joke .
right .
with no equipment , no rope .
of course .
come on , don't tell me you don't know how to do that .
how did you get by the laser field in the great hall?
the laser fields .
well ...
okay .
toulour , you're the best .
well , thank you , danny .
good .
now , if you can just get us our money ... ... we'll be going .
the money?
what money?
the money that you agreed to pay benedict if we won .
we're under a deadline .
no , no , no , you don't understand .
you didn't win .
you lost .
and not only did you lose ... ... your entire crew got pinched .
i gotta tell you something .
you don't look anything like her .
eventually , the nose , but the ears ...
i mean , the way you walk and you dress ...
that means that you spoke to lemarc .
you spoke to lemarc?
since i'm dead , i think my involvement in this should stay among the three of us .
of course .
absolutely .
it's ironic that the solution to all of our problems will be provided by toulour .
i'm sure i provoked him by agreeing with my american friend that you might be better .
i apologize sincerely for the trouble i've caused you .
there's no need .
especially now .
remember , from the time you see toulour at his villa and the challenge begins ... ... you must assume he will have you under surveillance everywhere you go .
you'll have to put on a very elaborate show .
the egg , the real egg ... ... will be carried in a backpack on a train leaving gare du nord ... ... at 9 : 30 a . m .
thank you .
you saved our lives , gaspar .
yeah .
and i'm still getting the better of you .
and i stole a replica?
your paintings are in a high security warehouse in milan .
it's 17 via andreotti , unit 222 .
security code is 2 3 1 1 6 ...
6 4 6 .
thank you .
listen , all games aside , that was ...
that was very good .
that was good .
how'd you do that?
well , i told you one story tonight .
i think that'll be enough .
so now ... ... if you , both of you , could please ...
now .
whose house is this?
it belongs to a thief i know in paris .
he knows my father?
probably better than anyone .
who is he?
he helped with the whole night fox thing .
what's his name?
his real name?
i don't know , actually .
i've only known him as lemarc .
lemarc?
oh , my god .
where the hell have you been?
waiting .
for what?
for this .
oh , my god .
so we done?
issue closed?
is it actually good?
it's good .
trust me .
i don't trust you , and i don't trust ocean .
if it's good , we're done .
these grudges , they're awful .
nobody wins .
danny's had enough of this meshugaas .
and the competition , it's worse than our business .
always some new young punk trying to prove himself .
guys like ocean , they keep coming back .
they don't like to lose .
too much ego , too much pride .
maybe for some guys , but not danny .
trust me on that .
danny don't feel like he lost in all this .
it's hard to believe , but that's how he feels .
well , if he tries anything ...
if anybody tries anything , i'll be waiting .
terry , i can't predict the future .
i pay professionals to do that , and even they get it wrong sometimes .
i can't say that nobody'll ever try to rob from you again .
lf , god forbid , anything does happen to you ... ... we will not be involved .
you better not be , reuben .
you better not be .
hey .
good to see you guys .
you don't remember?
you put me through hell , and you don't remember?
hey .
hey .
you're more beautiful than ever .
hey !
five oh five?
four oh five .
who's winning?
i'm little .
and you're big .
you're big?
oh , my god .
hello .
oh , my god .
you're all under arrest .
you're thieves .
you're crooks .
isabel , livingston dell .
thank you .
isabel , tess .
the adult table .
that's the kids 'table .
let me clear that for you .
i'm in .
can i get another beer?
i feel i know you .
wait , wait .
we didn't ... we didn't bet .
you want five?
five .
so nasty .
okay .
is that a joke?
yes .
jesus christ .
she's drunk !
