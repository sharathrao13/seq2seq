dead , i'm the one exterminating son slipping through the trees strangling the breeze
dead , i'm the sky watching angels cry as they slowly turn conquering the worm
dead i'm the pool spreading from the fool weakened want you need nowhere as you bleed
dead i'm the rat feast upon the cat tender is the fur dying as you purr
it's never quite that easy .
you go through the door , and they're never just sitting there waiting for you ... with a welcoming smile on their face .
best you can do is hope they fuck up ... and do what you can to be there when they do .
and then blame yourself for the killings?
oh , no .
i blame the asshole who did them .
this man's whole life is about killing .
he studies it .
he knows forensics .
he understands police procedure .
he prepares methodically so as to not to leave any evidence at the scene .
after he picks his target , he'll watch her for weeks .
he'll study every detail of her routine
when she comes home .
when she goes to sleep .
in the morning before the sun comes up , he can walk right up next to her .
even though the sun's still down , no one perceives it as night .
women who are careful at midnight , walk around half naked seven hours later .
finally , he'll pick a day .
takes a kit of tools and props duct tape , handcuffs , a weapon whatever he needs .
he'll let himself in .
that night , she'll get home .
go about her business , unaware that he's in the house .
oh ... this is good .
shall we dance?
no , don't play hard to get .
this will be fun .
shh .
shh .
it's over .
it's all right .
shh .
i said , " shut ... up .
when she passes out ... from foreordain , he'll revive her over and over again to
um
what were you going to say?
time's up .
joel .
why did you turn away from me?
why was it so hard for you to accept?
'cause you know i did it for you .
you came so close to me that night .
i remember clearly what i felt when i heard your footsteps following behind me .
pride .
i thought it would keep us together forever .
for me , it was our finest moment .
i can still see the flames .
oh !
shit .
what the fuck?
oh , fuck !
i didn't see anything .
wanda , you wanna run that in to sarge?
right on it .
hey , i'm detective mackie .
welcome to my crime scene .
can i help you find anything?
i'm just going home .
i live upstairs .
did you not happen to notice that yellow police tape marked " do not cross "?
if you're done with that , i'll just take it and go home . do you know this woman?
i've never seen her .
what happened?
is she dead?
oh , i haven't made any reference to homicide .
why would you hasten to such a conclusion?
well , you got half the block taped off , and you got what , about a dozen cops in there , fuckin 'up your crime scene?
it just doesn't seem like someone boosting stereos to me .
look here .
give me a call if you think of anything .
all right?
hello .
yeah , this is hollis .
hello .
this is campbell .
i'm the guy we met last night .
yeah , joel campbell .
our ex f. b. i. friend from apartment 805 .
we did a little checking on you after you left .
what can i do for you?
i can hardly are you busy?
it sounds like you're in the middle of something .
yeah , some genius jacked a honda a couple blocks ago .
that's an '86 .
what , do you want me to call you back?
no .
when did she die , the girl?
monday night .
three days ago .
why?
'cause i know who did it .
and how might you know that?
he mailed me a picture of her still alive .
i got it three days ago monday morning .
hold on a minute , campbell .
teen hoodis on the run .
okay .
sorry to keep you .
now ... you wanna meet me back at my office?
all right .
is it your custom to open your mail four days after you get it?
nope .
sometimes it takes up to two weeks .
well , this would appear ... to answer any questions we had whether these two cases were related .
goodness gracious .
nothin 'like a good serial killing to kick off the holiday season .
right in here .
gimme a minute in that room .
okay , lieutenant .
we got him sending his pictures in the mail .
campbell , hell , we oughta get bob barker in on this son of a bitch .
it's a damn game show .
his last alias was david allen griffin .
i worked the case for three and a half years in los angeles .
we attributed at least 11 homicides to him .
what's he doing in chicago?
i assume he's still strangling young women with piano wire .
all the victims were left partially unclothed , and all the swabs came back negative .
exactly .
no touchy , no feely .
have you ever seen this guy?
no .
no one's ever seen him .
well , then we can't necessarily conclude it's the same fella , can we?
come on .
he sent me fuckin 'pictures .
shoved the vic right up my ass in my own fucking building .
sorry .
it's quite all right .
you looked adorable .
this film stock says it's for exterior sunshine , but ... how does it handle in fluorescence?
uh , i'm sorry .
i have no idea what you're talking about .
i just work here .
you do film processing here .
uh , yeah , one hour .
do you mind?
sure .
what are you doing?
i'm going to test it out .
i'm gonna shoot some pictures , and you're going to process them for me .
perfect .
yeah , chief of chicago p. d. already called .
not surprising , i suppose , they're inviting us in on this .
they're setting up a joint task force as we speak .
i'd like to know if you think you can handle it on our end .
i know that in l. a.
oh , no , this isn't l. a.
it's not my job anymore .
you know what?
the only reason that your burnt out , messed up ass ... is standing in my office is because you had a three year head start on us .
this perp is set on putting you in the middle of this shit whether we like it or not .
you're right .
the field office in l. a. has the relevant files .
i can't tell you anything that's not in them .
i'm sorry .
mike .
excuse me .
mike , we got several sets of prints off the fedex envelope and the photo itself .
i'm sorry .
this is none of my business , but , uh , you can run the prints .
you're gonna get me , the driver , three guys from the warehouse ,
santa claus ... a whole bunch of elves .
definitely not this guy .
who the hell is that?
run it .
yes , sir .
ooh ooh can't anybody see
well , you're young .
do you plan to live on disability your whole life?
i take 200 milligrams of seconal just so i can sleep two and a half hours a night .
twice a day , i take 400 milligrams of acebutolol ... and 20 milligrams of lotensen for high blood pressure .
i self inject migraine medicine whenever the fuck i please .
they don't ... mix well with work .
hmm .
maybe you're just afraid .
fuckin 'right .
i am afraid .
okay .
let's talk about that .
i go places , and i forget why i'm there .
i miss exits on the freeway .
i'm lucky to ... find my way home from the grocery store .
and if i do , then ... most of the time i've forgotten my groceries .
but yet , you make it here every week .
twice a week .
yeah .
you do .
what if the next picture that arrived was of your daughter?
would you really want me to be the one looking for her?
yes .
yes ...
i would .
from this moment how can it feel this wrong
hello .
hi .
it's me .
me?
me who?
it's freaking cold here .
why'd you move here?
what the fuck do you want from me?
you hardly leave your apartment .
and when you do , it's to eat ... at that same terrible vietnamese restaurant night after night .
you seem so bored .
i was expecting a warmer welcome .
i didn't fuckin 'ask you here , did i?
the guy they replaced you with
i tried to make it work , but we just didn't see eye to eye at all .
i was going to quit the game entirely , but then i thought , " chicago's not so bad .
at least you didn't move to new jersey , right?
yeah .
so , why don't you grab a pen?
i'll give you the name and number of the ... agent that's on your case .
you can ... share your inner turmoil with him 'cause i don't give a shit .
i know your job is hard , joel , so i'm willing to take steps to try and make things work between us .
what are you talking about?
the photos , joel .
i'll send you a picture , and you can have a day to try to find her .
i'll give you till 9 : 00 .
what do you say , joel?
i say i should have moved to new jersey , asshole .
good night , joel .
are you all right?
i think so .
shit !
who is it?
flowers for joel campbell .
you didn't answer the phone .
the door downstairs was open , so i thought i'd just bring
put the flowers on the floor .
thank you .
the photos , joel .
i'll send you a picture , and you can have a day to try to find her .
no , i've never seen her .
is she dead?
i haven't made any reference to homicide .
why would you hasten to such a conclusion?
are you just afraid?
fuckin 'right .
i'm afraid .
what if the next picture that arrived was of your daughter?
really want me to be the one looking for her?
yes .
i'll send you a picture .
you can have a day to try to find her .
i got this a half hour ago .
i want the case .
can you handle it?
i guess we'll find out .
what else did this asshole say last night?
that's everything .
we already have a trap and trace on that line and on your cell phone .
what is that?
what is that , a bird?
this is a poster .
looks like it was shot inside .
could be taken anywhere .
it was processed commercially .
see if these numbers are traceable .

both girls are basically loners , very little social contact .
the last girl's parents were deceased .
no close friends as far as we can tell .
is that his victim profile?
no .
i mean , the victims were always young women , but he's sending pictures now .
he's only gonna target loners .
you know , women people don't notice .
he's not gonna send me a picture of the prom queen .
yeah .
well , listen .
before we go any further , we're gonna have to make a decision as to whether to go to the press with this .
we gotta make it now .
look .
there's no decision to make .
there is shit else we can do for this woman .
let's get him in front of the cameras .
they're gonna like him .
all i can tell you at this time is that ...
all i can tell you at this time is that ... we have substantial reason to believe this woman's life is in serious danger .
the chicago police department and the f. b. i. are working in concert ... to try and locate her , and we're gonna be grateful for any help ... you guys can give us in this endeavor .
every hour is critical .

hey , ma'am .
can you spare some change?

hey , dad !
dad , don't you recognize me?
hey , sir .
can you spare some change?

so , listen here .
what's the skinny on that radiant vision of loveliness down at the feds?
what's her name?
diana?
what i wouldn't give for 20 minutes with her at a drive in and a decent bowl of chili .
damn if you haven't found the worst restaurant in the whole city of chicago .
a really fine restaurant .
the other night , griffin was giving me ... a hard time about it too on the telephone .
what's up?
what's up?
what do you think the chances are he's watching us right now?
hey .
hey !
get outta here .
murder suspect heading west on commerce , near the intersection of lincoln .
blue , two door sedan , mid '80s , maybe a ford .
fuck !
goddamn it !
i'm standing outside the apartment of ellie buckner , the woman who chicago has come to know as " jane doe .
the harrowing search came to a tragic end about 9 : 20 p. m. , when police discovered buckner's body at her wicker park apartment .
it is a murder that has shocked this quiet neighborhood .
right
see you later .
bye .
excuse me .
i can't stay long .
i just wanted to come by ... and tell you how much i appreciate ... what you ... said the other day .
how have the headaches been?
about the same .
are you sleeping?
some .
how's work?
it's great .
i'm building an excellent fan base with the homicidal set .
how do you feel about that , about this man following you to chicago?
is it a vendetta?
that's a strange question .
no , i don't think vengeance has anything to do with it .
i think there's a story , a ritual that he follows .
over the years , i became part of the story .
it probably didn't make sense without me .
in other words , he missed you .
odd , isn't it?
did you miss him?
what the hell does that mean?
excuse me .
sorry .
campbell .
we received another photo .
i'll be right there .
where is she sitting?
let's get somebody from the city up here .
see if they can tell us something about this section of sidewalk .
is this the " el " here , you know?
parking meters .
yep , i'm on it .
mitch , let's get her picture in tattoo parlors .
got it .
what's your name?
well , usually , mr. abraham ,
i do an introductory session , where we both explore what you hope to get out of therapy .
if we both feel i'm the person to provide that for you , then we can decide on a schedule together .
and and i like to record my sessions .
but if you prefer
is that something that you do with all of your patients?
yeah , with most of them .
would you prefer that i didn't?
yes , i'd rather you not .
okay .
that's that's fine .
so , you say that you might need help .
in in what area?
i'm not sure .
what kind of help do you provide?
well , i i work with patients on many different issues .
do you think ... some of your patients ... might pay to come and see you because ... you're very pretty?
let's keep this focused on you , rather than on me , mr. abraham .
sure .
nice trick .
i'm gonna try it again though , okay?
yeah , whatever .
a couple of years ago , they did a neighborhood renovation ... where they put those benches around some of the trees downtown .
where downtown?
bring up the city .
basically the broadway and belmont area .
that's 15 to 20 city blocks .
yeah .
there are five million people in this city .
how can no one have known this person?
can you spare some change?
how can this happen in the communication age?
authorities have focused the search for " jane doe # 2 "
hey , dad .
dad , it's me .
don't you recognize me?
leave me alone .
come on , pop .
i need you , man .
the city of chicago is on alert .
police are searching for a woman connected to the photograph they have received .
it appears the murder may be linked to a serial killer in the los angeles area .
at this point , the woman police are calling " jane2 " ... has not yet been located ...
and all those involved are very concerned about her well being .
yeah .
we've got jane doe's mother on the phone .
i'll be right there .
you know what?
get a picture at every skateboarding place and guitar shop ... that's anywhere near that broadway and
belmont .
belmont .
exactly .
wish i could find some letters .
there aren't any .
she never wrote anybody .
she called three times .
did she say where she was calling from?
she said all kinds of things .
i never knew what to believe .
she has a new boyfriend .
so tell me about the boyfriend .
he's a lawyer .
yeah , right .
can you remember anything else about the calls?
anything might help .
a few months ago , she called to announce she's got a job at seattle's best coffee .
seattle's best?
seattle's best?
not good news .
she does not work , nor has she ever worked at seattle's best .
i don't care whether she works there or not , she is sitting in front of a coffee shop .
i don't know .
it looks like a bench to me .
it could be anywhere .
i'll be honest with you .
look at the photo .
there are seven people in the picture .
three of them are holding the same kind of coffee cup .
she's sitting in front of a fucking coffee shop .
get someone into every seattle's best in the city ... and any place that sells coffee in the broadway belmont area .
take a look at this .
okay .
is that too fast?
okay , okay .
whoa !
you wanna kill me , sweetie?

i don't give a shit what you told the other guy .
i wanna know where she lives .
i wanna know where she is .

as our light goes out there's nothing left to say there's nothing left to say or talk about
you can't say anything i don't know i already understand

hi , joel .
how's the heart , pal?
here .
you want a beer?
it would make it feel better .
stop .
here .
tell me something .
did you move 2, 000 miles to live near this woman's grave?
you did , didn't you?
man , you've gotta get out more .
i mean , is this a satisfying relationship?
you know , she loves me .
she's decomposing .
she loves me .
she's decomposing .
what are we doing here?
what is this?
you here to give yourself up?
why didn't you tell anyone you were fucking her?
just 'cause she was married?
we don't seem to be communicating .
let me be clear with you .
i have no problem with shooting you dead where you sit .
well , you do have one problem .
if i'm dead , your friend polly is going to meet a rather gruesome fate ... involving candlelight and quite a large pool of kerosene .
and you know something about attractive women burning , don't you?
tell me , what was it like?
could you smell her flesh burning?
you've already killed her .
come on .
you know me better than that .
that's not even her blood .
take me to see her then .
oh , i don't know about that .
can't we just sit here for a little while and talk , joel?
we'll talk once i see her .
i just need to know if there's anything to talk about .
go on , take it .
i just need to see that she's all right , then we'll talk .
well , fine .
let's go .
it's good to see you , joel .
it really is .
wow , it's loaded .
we're going to make it through this , aren't we , joel?
i think that's more up to you than it is to me .
you look older since you were in l. a.
you're a good friend .
you're like a brother to me .
did you know that?
do you have any real brothers or sisters?
what the fuck what is that?
i'm trying to have a real conversation , and you're psychoanalyzing me .
what are you , dr. polly now?
i was just curious .
look at me when i talk to you .
you're trying to control this situation .
stop trying to control this situation .
can't you just leave your job out of this? just this once?
i'm telling you .
i think you're spending too much time with that polly bitch .
what do you need?
i want you to think about what you need .
it's up to me to try and get that and make an exchange .
anything you need for ms. beilman's safety .
what i need is you .
hold on .
hello .
i knew if i just came here and talked to you in person , you'd understand me better , joel .
fuck me , he's got campbell !
trace it !
you were the only one who thought about me , who really knew me .
for a long time ,
i was the only one you had .
and then you met lisa .
pull in here .
give me a second .
give me a second .
okay , he's about 20 miles north of the city .
yeah , you're gonna have to do better than that .
now come on .
no shit !
give me another minute and we'll have his exact location .
i got him !
i got him .
he's right on the water .
come on in .
polly , joel .
joel , polly .
she freak out at a damaged life like a jailbait in the park a teenage wolf and a bloody knife going down in the dark how to make a monster baby how to get it on how to make a monster baby how to get it on go , go , zombie go , go , yeah , yeah , yeah
go , go , zombie go , go , yeah , yeah , yeah
roots in hell and time will tell if your baby is insane a child bride with bloody eyes and satan on the brain
wakey , wakey , joel .
that hurts , doesn't it?
i've heard that flashing lights and migraines don't go together at all .
you're no fun .
oh , no , polly .
no , no , i'm not gonna kill him .
we need each other .
we define each other .
we're ... yin and yang , black and white .
isn't that right , polly?
polly?
i said , " isn't that right?
i don't understand the question .
did you or did you not , in your professional opinion , reach the conclusion that joel and i need each other in order to give meaning to our lives?
yes .
yes , but i
see?
take your fucking hands off her .
i said take your fucking hands off her .
sit down , joel .
sit down .
i'll sit here and listen to you talk all night .
just take your hands off her .
come on , put the fucking gun down .
we both know you're not gonna do it .
and why do we know that?
because you can only kill her once .
he's right .
he's right .
upsy daisy .
how's this for deja vu?
we've got the fire .
we've got the pretty girl .
only instead of bringing us together , you move to chicago .
the guilt must have been unbearable .
or something like that .
is that what you want me to say?
i feel guilty a woman is dead because i made a terrible mistake .
no .
no , no .
that wasn't the mistake .
the mistake was turning back instead of pouring all you had into us .
what do i want you to say?
i want you to say thank you .
i want you to say thank you for coming here and saving your pathetic life .
david , do you know how many serial killers are active in chicago right now?
five .
in the midwest , at least a dozen .
i could work on any one of them without even packing a bag .
you get hit by a bus on a thursday , i'm working on a new guy on monday .
you're my job .
you're paperwork .
i can't believe you still don't know who you're talking to .
no , no , no !
no , please don't
i have to do this .
he's not going to understand anything else .
you heard him .
paperwork .
thank you .
what did you say?
i said , " thank you .
tell me again .
i said , " thank you .
get out of here .
let's go !
run , run !
joel !
joel !
give me your hand !
reach for it !
ready?
reach .
here you go .
you all right?
give me that blanket .
where's the girl?
is she all right?
she's right over there .
let's get the fucking body out .
okay .
it's never quite that easy .
you go through the door .
they're never just sitting there waiting for you with a welcoming smile on their face .
the best you can do is hope they fuck up and do what you can to be there when they do .
