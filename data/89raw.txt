why , you ...

we got a nice private cell waiting for your ass at quantico .
and i'm gonna personally see you get there .
i'm terribly sorry !

the bride always gets to kiss her best man .
i thought it was the other way round .
oh .
oh , james , would you mind?
felix is still in the study and we've got to cut the cake .
i'll do anything for a woman with a knife .
thank you .

you have a house full of guests waiting .
just let me save this .
take a seat .
the department wants a full report ... yesterday .
we really hit it lucky today .
sanchez hasn't been out of his home base for years .
couldn't you extradite him?
he's killed , intimidated or bribed ... .. half the officials from here to chile .
there's only one law down there sanchez's law .
plomo o plata .
lead or silver .
ah .
ed .
double congratulations , old buddy .

lures .
these'll keep you busy for a few days .
you're not going fishing on my honeymoon .
how many others are being held there?
where are you taking him , mr killifer?
mr sanchez , will you look this way for a picture , please?
come on !

what is your real nationality?
are you really colombian?

you know the tradition?
the next one who catches this is the next one who ...
no .
no .
thanks , della .
it's time i left .
oh , james .

he was married once .
but it was a long time ago .
felix , you're no good to me with a wrecked back .
let her go .
i'm the one you want .
hey !
ready to go?
we got the batteries recharged on the sub .
it'll take you to the limit .
fast boat to cuba .
you'll be there for breakfast .
relax .
we'll wait for dario .
look , are you crazy?
you got everybody lookin 'for you .
what about killifer?
havin 'a cop here is nuts .
i wanna deep six him .
i made a deal with this guy , and i'm gonna keep my word .
i don't like it .
he can finger me .
i spent a fortune on this cover .
something you'd better understand , amigo .
loyalty is more important to me than money .
now get the cop .
killifer .
here's two million .
all in twenties .
it's very heavy , but difficult to trace .
smart .
now , be ready for tomorrow .
i'll have someone pick you up .
where's lupe?
on the boat .
keep her there until i send for her .
est bien .
hey , no foolin 'around with my girl .

after what you did to that guy on the islands?
you liked my little valentine , huh?
where's my wife?
don't worry .
we gave her a nice honeymoon .
i want you to know this is nothing personal .
it's purely ... business .
killifer? !
sorry , old buddy , but two mil is a hell of a chunk of dough .
aagh !
killing me won't stop anything , sanchez !
there are worse things than dying , hombre .
aagh !
aagh !
aagh !
aagh !

no .
today is the first day of the rest of your life .
no !
good morning .
good morning .

felix?
della !
della?
felix .
you'll be all right .
hang on .
hey , leiter .
where you been?
it's bond .
get an ambulance here , quick !
hi , sharky .
you stick around .
i might have some more questions for you , ok?
how is he?
his left leg's gone below the knee .
they might be able to save his arm .
you can bet it was a chain saw .
colombians use them on informers .
hell , they sell more here than in the state of oregon .
i wish i could be more hopeful , but we'll have to wait and see .
chain saw , my ass .
i know a shark bite when i see one .
sanchez has vanished .
he's got all of leiter's files .
god only knows what's in them .
well , find him .
he's out of our jurisdiction .
there's plenty of countries that would protect him .
we can't even get an extradition .
there are other ways .
let it go , commander .
you're gonna do nothing?
you're just gonna forget all about it?
no , i'm not gonna forget about it .
looks like sanchez 'law operates north of the border , too .
let's go shark hunting .
this is the last place in the keys .
we'll have to try miami next .
stay here .
you stay out of sight .
i'll handle this .
we're closed .
ain't nobody here .
look , i've come all the way from london to see you .
universal exports .
we've been retained ... .. to arrange shipment of a carcharodon carcharias .
a what?
great white shark .
it's all right , bill .
let him in .
unfortunately , we sold all our sharks years ago .
as you can see , we do purely research now .
it's a project to feed the third world .
we feed maggot to our special breed of genetically engineered fish .
use hormones to make them all male gain weight faster .
from your shark hunting days?
uh , yeah .
actually , it's for sale .
look , i'm kinda busy .
maybe some other time .
thank you .
i'll look forward to seeing you again .
goodbye , mr , er ...
goodbye .
mr krest said to be ready .
he'll send the sub back in three hours to pick you up .
can't wait .
this dump gives me the creeps .
james .
hold it ... right there .
do you mind if i get my hands out of here?
yeah .
do it slowly .
bon apptit .
freeze !
over by the trap door , old buddy .
is this where you put your old buddy felix?
not me .
chalk that one up to sanchez and krest .
whoa !
whoa !
there's two million dollars in that suitcase .
i'll split it with you .
you earned it .
you keep it ... old buddy .
aagh !
god , what a terrible waste .
of money .
hey , sharky !
any news on the wavekrest?
she's a big marine research vessel , ... .. owned by a milton krest .
they're collecting specimens off the cay sel bank .
how long will it take us to get there?
maybe about six hours .
i've a few things to pick up .
be ready in an hour .
hey , commander .
you got a minute?
local cops got a tip about a warehouse last night .
turned up 500 keys of colombian pure , a couple of stiffs , ... .. and a little bitty piece of what used to be killifer .
good .
at least someone's on the case .
you may be a pal of leiter's , but i can only cover up so much .
the dea is screaming to know what happened .
you know , we , we got laws in this country , too .
do you have a law against what they did to leiter?
look , you're in over your head .
this is where it ends , commander .
you were supposed to be in istanbul last night .
i'm afraid this unfortunate leiter business has ... clouded your judgment .
you have a job to do .
i expect you on a plane this afternoon .
i haven't finished here , sir .
leave it to the americans .
it's their mess .
let them clear it up .
sir , they're not going to do anything .
i owe it to leiter .
he's put his life on the line for me many times .
oh , spare me this sentimental rubbish !
he knew the risks .
and his wife?
this private vendetta of yours ... .. could easily compromise her majesty's government .
you have an assignment .
i expect you to carry it out objectively and professionally .
then you have my resignation , sir .
we're not a country club , 007 .
effective immediately ... your licence to kill is revoked , ... .. and i require you to hand over your weapon .
now .
i need hardly remind you that you're still bound by the official secrets act .
well , i guess it's , er ... .. a farewell to arms .
don't !
too many people !
god help you , commander .
something in sector c.
you caused us all a lot of trouble , young lady .
you're borracho .
go to bed .
when sanchez heard you ran away , ...
.. he went nuts .
it's none of your business .
it's my business when your stupid little tricks get sanchez arrested ... .. and i gotta put my organisation at risk to get him out .
the dea just raided key west .
you cost me a lot of dough .
he'll give you the money .
uh uh .
he doesn't work that way .
you'd better watch yourself , girlie .
i've known him a long time .
i've seen a lot of girls like you come ... and go .
you're drunk .
get out .
and stop peeking through my windows .
come on .
what are you so stuck up for?
he fixed that phoney beauty contest you won .
hey ...
mr krest .
yeah .
what?
the sentinel's picking up something large on the monitor .
you'd better take a look .
i don't believe this .
what the hell is it now?
it's just a manta ray .
get the probe back in .
we'll start loading now .
yes , sir .
he said " you're ok .
take care of him .
make a sound and you're dead .
you ...
what are you doing in here?
krest gave me his cabin .
he's next door .
where's sanchez?
he's not on board .
i don't know where he is .
you're his girlfriend .
he doesn't tell me anything .
open up .
i need to talk to you .
answer it .
just a moment .
what do you want?
somebody slipped aboard .
did you ...
.. see anybody?
no , i was sleeping .
go away .
mr krest .
they're back .
bolt your door .
who whipped you?
sanchez?
it was my fault .
i did something wrong , made him angry .
nice work , clive .
thanks , mr krest .
guess what?
his name was sharky .
get rid of the boat .
we've got work to do .
you'd better find yourself a new lover .
don't you men know any other way?
it's sanchez 'way .
you seem to like it .
you know nothing .
please go .
if they find you here , we'll both be killed .
stay here .
we got everything useful out of her .
that's it .
take her out and sink her .
ok , clive .
cast off !
compliments of sharky .
man overboard !
get him !
don't let him get away !
what's wrong?
get back in your cabin and stay there .
the guy must have drowned , mr krest .
don't be so sure .
find him .
launch sentinel .
yes , sir .
stand by to dive when i tell you .
numbers one and two , dive !
i can see something reflecting over there .
there's too much turbulence to be sure .
wavekrest , wavekrest .
estamos listos .
muy bien .
loading completed , mr krest .
bring sentinel back in .
mr krest !
bring sentinel up !
there he is , there !
right there !

aagh !
aagh !
there !
pick him up !
all boats return to wavekrest !
aye aye , sir !

put her stern in .
hey , do you know someone called bouvier?
over there .
now , this is an unexpected pleasure .
where's leiter?
intensive care .
where you'll be if you don't get out of here fast .
sanchez has leiter's files .
your name's all over them .
hell , i knew something was wrong .
those two have been at the bar for hours .
probably waiting to see who showed up .
would you like anything to drink?
bud with a lime .
same .
sure thing , hon .
shit !
it's dario .
he's bad news .
he used to be with the contras before they kicked him out .
just the kind of guy sanchez would send .
you carrying?
if they start shooting , just hit the deck and stay there .
la senorita bouvier .
don't i know you from somewhere?
no .
oh , yes , i do .
you used to fly charter planes for some friends of mine .
i got a job for you .
why don't we go outside and we talk in private?
take your hands off her !
she's with me .
nobody's asking you , gringo .
he's with me .
keep your hands on the table .
here we go .
two beers .
that'll be 3 . 50 .
do your friends want something?
let me get it .
he's had enough .
run a tab .
ok .
how did you get here?
by boat .
it's right behind this wall .
thanks .
touch !
get it started .
come on !
don't move .
relax .
it's a bulletproof vest .
this kevlar is great !
you're bloody lucky to be alive !
it's not luck .
it's experience .
any higher , it'd have been your head .
look , i just saved your life back there !
if it wasn't for me , your ass would've been nailed to the wall .
you saved my life?
yes .
it's a tough business you picked , miss bouvier .
leave it to the professionals .
look , pal , i was an army pilot .
i have flown to the toughest hellholes !
i will not have you lecture me about professionalism !
out of gas .
i haven't heard that one in a long time .
well , they must have hit the fuel line .
look , i'm gonna need your help .
i want a complete rundown on sanchez 'operation .
and i'll need a flight to isthmus city .
private .
no one must know i've left .
what do you wanna go there for?
i'll pay you very well .
you're going after sanchez , aren't you?
will you help me?
how many men have you got?
just you and me .
are you crazy?
sanchez has an entire army protecting him .
just fly me in and leave .
50, 000 .
it's not that easy .
false flight plans , payoffs at the airport .
i can't do it for less than a hundred .
sixty .
ninety .
seventy .
eighty .
seventy five .
you pay the fuel?
you get the plane .
deal .
why don't you wait until you're asked?
well , why don't you ask me?
there are five typing errors on the first page alone .
what's got into you?
sorry , sir .
us immigration has no reports of 007 leaving the united states ... .. as of 1 500 hours today .
who authorised this?
i did , sir .
it's james .
he's gone missing .

we're south of the border .

thanks for everything .
your job's finished .
i wanna stay .
too dangerous .
enough people are dead .
don't talk to me about danger .
i won't be safe until sanchez is dead .
besides , you could use my help .
if you're gonna stay and be my executive secretary , you'd better look the part .
here .
buy yourself some decent clothes .
what bank does sanchez use?
i need to make a deposit .
the biggest one in town .
banco de isthmus .
he owns it .
adelante .
senor bond .
i've come to make a small deposit .
my people downstairs are capable of ...
please , sit down .
we operate the world's largest private investment fund .
our biggest problem ... is what to do with all the money .
we have a cash surplus of ten million a day , ... .. which we ship through our bank to the us federal reserve , ... .. thus establishing credits which can be used for any legitimate investment .
you see , someone has to help the gringos with their trade deficit .
make out a deposit receipt for $4, 900, 000 for senor bond .
s , senor .
and there will be additional monthly deposits in the same amount .
of course .
we are experienced in handling accounts of this nature .
let me pass .
no .
no puede pasar sin permiso .
tenemos un cliente aqu .
senor montelongo?
i'm miss kennedy , mr bond's executive secretary .
i'd also appreciate it if you could establish a line of credit for me at the casino .
shall we say two million dollars?
no problem .
you have excellent collateral , and our chairman also owns the casino .
a very convenient arrangement .
we have always thought so , senorita .
thank you .
good evening , ladies and gentlemen , and welcome .
this is a special night for us .
we want you to know that only through your generous donations ... .. can the work here at the omi continue to progress .

we need your help .
we need you to go to your phones now and make a pledge .
this is not for me .
this is not for them .
it's for all of us .
are you ok , reinita?
i'm fine .
krest called me from the boat with a story about somebody ripping him off .
did you see anything happen?
no , franz .
i stayed in my cabin most of the time .

upstairs in his office .
he's been there all day .
he's planning a party for some orientals tomorrow night .
and what did you tell him about the wavekrest?
