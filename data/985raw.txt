raindrops on roses   and whiskers on kittens   bright copper kettles   and warm woolen mittens   brown paper packages   tied up with string   these are a few   of my favorite things
we were somewhere around barstow , on the edge of the desert ... when the drugs began to take hold .
i feel a bit lightheaded .
maybe you should drive .  [ continues ]
hmm?
suddenly there was a terrible roar all around us ... and the sky was full of what looked like huge bats ...
all swooping and screeching and diving around the car .
holy jesus , what are these goddamned animals?
come on , baby
did you say something?
hmm?
never mind .
it's your turn to drive .
no point in mentioning these bats , i thought .
the poor bastard'll see them soon enough .  baby , i'm startin 'to feel human
ohh , ohh , yeah   hey , hey , feel with me , baby
'cause i feel it comin 'on   [ continues ]
fucking pigs !
flying !
we had two bags of grass ... 75 pellets of mescaline ... five sheets of high powered blotter acid ... a salt shaker half full of cocaine ... a whole galaxy of multicolored uppers , downers , screamers , laughers .
also a quart of tequila , a quart of rum , a case of beer ...
a pint of raw ether ...
shit ! two dozen amyls .
not that we needed all that for the trip ... but once you get locked into a serious drug collection ... the tendency is to push it as far as you can .
the only thing that really worried me was the ether .
there is nothing in the world more helpless and irresponsible and depraved ... than a man in the depths of an ether binge ... and i knew we'd get into that rotten stuff pretty soon .

a house subcommittee report says illegal drugs killed ... 160 american g. i. s last year ... 40 of them in vietnam .
one toke over the line sweet jesus
one toke , man !
one toke , you poor fool?  sweet , sweet mary
wait'll you see those goddamned bats , man .  mine  [ radio continues ]
one toke over the line
let's give that boy a lift .
what?
no !  [ ends ]
wait !
we can't stop here .
this is bat country .
hot damn !
i never rode in a convertible before !
is that right?
well , i guess you're about ready then , aren't ya?
we're your friends .
we're not like the others , man .
really .
no more of that talk , or i'll put the leeches on you .
understand?
get in .
how long could we maintain , i wondered .
how long before one of us starts raving and jabbering at this boy?
what will he think then?
this same lonely desert was the last known home of the manson family .
would he make that grim connection when my attorney starts screaming ... about bats and huge manta rays coming down on the car?
if so , well , we'll just have to cut his head off and bury him somewhere .
'cause it goes without saying that we can't turn him loose .
he'd report us at once to some kind of outback nazi law enforcement agency ... and they'll run us down like dogs .
jesus , did i say that , or just think it?
jesus , did i say that?
was i talking?
did they hear me?
it's okay .
just admiring the shape of your skull .
no , thanks !
maybe i'd better have a chat with this boy .
i have asthma !
perhaps if i explain things , he'll rest easy .
all right , listen .
there's one thing you should probably understand can you hear me?
good .
i want you to have all the background .
aah !
this is a very ominous assignment ... with overtones of extreme personal danger .
i'm a doctor of journalism .
this is important , goddamn it !
this is a fucking true story !
you fucking
get your hands off my fucking head !
now , now , now .
our vibrations were getting nasty .
but why?
was there no communication in this car?
had we deteriorated to the level of dumb beasts?
this man at the wheel is my attorney .
he's not just some dingbat i found on the strip , man .
he's a foreigner .
i think he's probably samoan .
it doesn't matter , though , does it?
are you prejudiced?
hell , no .
i didn't think so .
because , in spite of his race , the man is extremely valuable to me .
oh , shit .
i forgot about the beer .
you want some?
no .
how 'bout some ether?
what?
never mind .
all right , let's get right to the heart of this thing .
twenty four hours ago we were sitting ...
... in the pogo lounge ... of the beverly heights hotel , in the patio section , of course ... drinking singapore slings with mescal on the side ... hiding from the brutish realities of this foul year of our lord , 1971 .
cops were goin 'apeshit
perhaps this is the call you've been waiting for all this time , sir .
perhaps .
yeah .
mm hmm .
mmm !
really .
all right .
yeah?
oh , yeah , yeah .
oh , yeah .
okay .
bye .
that was headquarters .
they want me to  ahem .
thank you .
they want me to go to las vegas at once ... make contact with a portuguese photographer named lacerda .
he'll have all the details .
all i have to do is check into my soundproof suite .
he'll seek me out .
what do you think?
sounds like real trouble .
you're gonna need plenty of legal advice before this thing is over .
oh , yeah .
as your attorney , i advise you to rent a fast car with no top .
and you'll need the cocaine .
tape recorder for special music .
acapulco shirts .
get the hell out of l. a. for at least 48 hours .
blows my weekend .
why?
'cause , naturally , i'm gonna have to go with you .
we're gonna have to arm ourselves to the teeth .
well , why not?
i mean , if a thing's worth doing , it's worth doing right .
this is the american dream in action .
wait !
shit , we'd be fools not to ride this strange torpedo all the way out to the end .
indeed .
we must do it .
what kind of story is this?
it's the mint 400 ... the richest off road race for motorcycles and dune buggies in the history of organized sport .
it's a fantastic spectacle ... in honor of some fatback grosero ... who owns the luxurious mint hotel in downtown las vegas .
at least that's what the press release says .
as your attorney , i advise you to buy a motorcycle .
how else can you cover a thing like this righteously?
well , we're gonna have to drum it up on our own .
pure gonzo journalism .
shit !
getting hold of the drugs and shirts had been no problem ... but the car and tape recorder were not easy things to round up at 6 : 30 ... on a friday afternoon in hollywood .
sounds beautiful .
great .
hang on to it .
fuckin 'a , the gentleman has a major credit card !
that's right , man .
don't take any guff from these fucking swine .
i just got through saying that .
do you realize who the fuck you're talking to?
do you?
be over in 30 minutes .
we're gonna need a sound store .
we won't make the nut unless we have unlimited credit .
we will , man .
you samoans are all the same .
you have no faith in the essential decency of the white man's culture .
the store was closed ... but the salesman said he could wait if we'd hurry .
but we were delayed en route when the stingray in front of us killed a pedestrian .
we had trouble again with the car rental agency .
mr. duke , we're all settled .
if i could get your john hancock , you're on your way .
yeah .
you're gonna be real careful with this car , right?
oh , yeah , man .
of course .
holy smokes !
you just backed over a 2 foot concrete abutment , you didn't even slow down .
what , were you going about , uh , oh , i don't know , 45 miles an hour backwards?
there's no harm done .
oh?
i always test the transmission that way , the rear end for stress factors .
boy , this is really a nice pen , man .
hey , uh , listen , you you fellas haven't been , uh , drinking , have you?
no .
not me .
oh .
well
we're responsible people .
damn it , you've got my pen !
goddamn hippies !
we spent the rest of that night rounding up materials and packing the car .
then we ate some mescaline and went swimming .
our trip was different .
it was to be a classic affirmation ... of everything right and true in the national character ... a gross physical salute to the fantastic possibilities of life in this country .
but only for those with true grit .
and we are chock full of that , man .
damn right !
my attorney understands this concept , despite his racial handicap .
but do you?
he said he understood , but i could see in his eyes that he didn't .
he was lying to me .
ohh !
aaah !
aaah !
aaah !
ohhhhh !
medicine !
what?
medicine !
medicine?
oh , yeah , medicine !
right .
right here .
don't worry .
this man has a bad heart .
angina pectoris .
but we have a cure for it .
here you go .
all right .
big whiff .
big whiff .
big whiff , sonny boy .
ah .
there you go .
much better .
now for the doctor .
what the
what the fuck are we doing out here in the middle of the desert?
somebody call the police .
we need help .
we need help .
we need help .
we need help .
the truth .
truth?
we're goin 'to vegas ... to croak a scag baron named savage henry .
it's true .
why?
because i've known him for years ... but he ripped us off .
and you know what that means .
and you know what that means .
right?
no .
mm hmm .
savage henry ... has cashed his check .
cashed his check .
and we're gonna rip his lungs out .
and eat them .
that bastard won't get away with this .
i mean , what is going on in this country ... when a scum sucker like that can get away with sandbagging a doctor of journalism?
hey !
thanks for the ride !
don't worry about me !
wait a minute !
come back and have a beer !
shit .
fuck .
i'm gonna miss him .
move over !
did you see his eyes?
we have to get out of california before that kid finds a cop .
scoot over , you fat bastard .
we had a real freak on our hands !
oh , shit .
it was absolutely imperative that we get to the mint hotel ... before the deadline for press registration .
otherwise we might have to pay for our suite .
jesus !
did you see what god just did to us , man?
god didn't do that .
you did it .
you're a narcotics agent .
i knew it .
that was our cocaine , you fucking pig , swine , whore !
you'd better be careful .
plenty of vultures out here that'll pick your bones clean before morning .
you fucking whore .
hee hee hee .
here's your half of the sunshine acid .
eat it .
yeah .
great .
how long do i have?
as your attorney , i advise you to drive at top speed ... or it'll be a goddamn miracle if we can get there before you turn into a wild animal .
are you ready for that?
checking into a vegas hotel under a phony name ... with intent to commit capital fraud and a head full of acid?
i sure hope so .
thirty minutes .
it was going to be very close .  [ continues ]
well , she's all you'd ever want   she's the kind i'd like to flaunt   and take to dinner  [ man on p. a. ]

the name rang a bell , but i couldn't concentrate .
terrible things were happening all around us .

impossible to walk in this muck .
no footing at all .  [ continues ]
mr. roger pratt , please call the hotel operator .
how can i bear to see your heart break   to see your heart break   over me   [ continues ]
i was right in the middle of a fucking reptile zoo ... and somebody was giving booze to these goddamn things .

late battle reports indicate  panic now , charlie .
turn this shit off .
the racers were ready at dawn .
very tense .
in some circles the mint 400 is a far , far better thing ... than the super bowl , the kentucky derby ... and the lower oakland roller derby finals all rolled into one .
slow down !
this is a restricted area !
this race attracts a very special breed .
fuck off .
all right .
it was time to get grounded , to ponder this rotten assignment ...
and figure out how to cope with it .
whoa !
it was time to do the job .
those of us who had been up all night were in no mood for coffee and doughnuts .
we wanted strong drink .
we were , after all ...
the absolute cream of the national sporting press .
pull !
we were gathered in las vegas for this very special moment in sport .
when it comes to a thing like this , they don't fool around .
it's , uh , just beautiful .
money plays .

another great start with a lot of dirt happening on this hill !
all right , here we go with the third group .
and they're off !
number 45 riding in the number four position ... is choking as the dust flies !
you'd better wet those bandannas you got stretched over your face !
there was something like 190 more bikes waiting to start .
gimme a beer , man .
they were due to go off , ten at a time ... every two minutes .
there you go , buddy .
goddamn it .
what day is it?
saturday?
shit .
more like sunday .
ahh .
hello !
anyone?
have you seen the race?
by 10 : 00 they were spread out all over the course .
ohh !
it was no longer a race .
now it was an endurance contest .
the idea of trying to cover this race in any conventional press sense was absurd .
hey !
it's pretty great , huh?
what?
come on in !
i'm just gonna try different combinations of lenses and film ... until i find something that works in this dust !
what the hell?
that's fucking machine guns .
they're firing at us .
machine guns !
it's a goddamn war zone !
get us out of here quick !
yeee hoo !

awful jackass .
all right .
just drive into the dust !
i never wanna see you again .
just drive into the dust !
huh?
ohh .
the race was definitely underway .

why should i pay my hard earned dollars to watch a fucking corpse?
i don't know about you ...

this was bob hope's turf .  strangers in the night

what happened?
oh .
ohh .
one of these days i'll toss a fuckin 'bomb in that place .
oh , wait .

this is the place , man .
they'll never fuck with us here .
where's the ether?
mescaline's not working .
oh .
there we go .
right .
yeah .
why not?
yeah .
mm hmm .
ahh .
devil ether .
it makes you behave like the village drunkard in some early irish novel .
total loss of all basic motor skills .
blurred vision , no balance , numb tongue .
the mind recoils in horror ... unable to communicate with the spinal column ... which is interesting because you can actually watch yourself behaving in this terrible way ... but you can't control it .
you approach the turnstiles and know that when you get there ... you have to give the man two dollars or he won't let you inside ... but when you get there everything goes wrong .
some angry rotarian shoves you and you think , " what's happening here?
dogs fucked the pope .
no fault of mine .  [ continues , distorted ]
ether is the perfect drug for las vegas .
in this town they love a drunk .
fresh meat .
come on , buddy .
come on .
holy
so they put us through the turnstiles and turned us loose inside .  [ drum roll ]
ladies and gentlemen ... boys and girls ...
visitors of all ages ...
ooooh whoop !  [ continues ]
oh , my god !
whoop !
mm hmm  [ snarling continues ]
whoa !
excuse me .
get out of my way , you  [ elephant trumpets ]
a drug person can learn to cope with things like seeing their dead grandmother ... crawling up their leg with a knife in her teeth ... but nobody should be asked to handle this trip .
bazooko circus is what the whole hep world would be doing saturday night ... if the nazis had won the war .
this was the sixth reich .
place your bets !
everyone's a winner !
step right up and shoot the pasties off the nipples of a ten foot bull dyke ... and win a cotton candy goat !
step up to this fantastic machine !
for just 99 cents your likeness will appear 200 feet tall ... on a screen over downtown las vegas .
for just 99 cents more you can have a voice message !
say whatever you want , fella !
oh , they'll hear you , all right !
you'll be 200 feet tall !
the ether was wearing off .
the acid was long gone .
but the mescaline was running strong .
good mescaline comes on slow .
the first hour's all waiting ... and then about halfway through its second hour ... you start cursing the creep who burned you because nothing's happening .
and then ... zang !
i hate to say this [ hiccup ]
but this place is getting to me .
i think i'm [ hiccup ] getting the fear .
nonsense .
we came here to find the american dream .
now that we're right in the vortex , you wanna quit?

one of the things you learn after years of dealing with drug people ... is that you can turn your back on a person ... but never turn your back on a drug ... especially when it's waving a razor sharp hunting knife in your eye .
whoa !
what was i doing out here?
what was the meaning of this trip?
was i just roaming around in a drug frenzy of some kind ... or had i really come out here to las vegas to work on a story?
who are these people , these faces?
where do they come from?
they look like caricatures of used car dealers from dallas ... and , sweet jesus , there are a hell of a lot of them at 4 : 30 on a sunday morning ... still humping the american dream that vision of the big winner ... somehow emerging from the last minute , pre dawn chaos of a stale vegas casino .
twenty .

electrocution .

when logic and proportion
have fallen  goddamn it !  sloppy dead   and the white knight
is talking backwards  let's see .  and the red queen's " off with her head "  [ muttering ]
remember  [ muttering ]
oh , god almighty .
help !

when the rabbit bites its own head off ...

boy , are you upset .
there'd be no point , man , calling the cops .
there's no choice .
i wouldn't dare go to sleep with you wandering around with a head full of acid ... wanting to slice me up with that goddamn knife .
who said anything about slicing you up , man?
i just wanted to cut a little " z " in your forehead .

the acid had shifted gears on him .
the next phase would probably be one of those hellishly intense introspective nightmares .
must get some peace .
four hours or so of catatonic despair .
damn drugs .
aaaaah !
mmm?
ignore the nightmare in the bathroom .
just another ugly refugee from the love generation .
my attorney had never been able to accept the notion ... often espoused by former drug abusers ... that you can get a lot higher without drugs than with them .
neither have i , for that matter .  when the truth is found   to be lies   and all the joy   within you dies   don't you want somebody to love   don't you need somebody to love   wouldn't you love somebody to love   you better find somebody to love   love   [ continues ]
1965 .
the great san francisco acid wave .  when the garden flowers
i recall one night in a place called the matrix .
there i was
mother of god .
there i am .
holy fuck .
uh , clearly i was a victim of the drug explosion ... a natural street freak just eating whatever came by .
does anybody want some lsd?
i got all the makin's ... right here !
all i need is a place to cook .
i decided to eat only half of the acid at first ... but i spilled the rest on the sleeve of my red woolen shirt .
what's the trouble?
well , all this white stuff ... on my sleeve ... is lsd .
with a bit of luck ... his life was ruined forever ... always thinking that just behind some narrow door in all his favorite bars ... men in red woolen shirts ... are getting incredible kicks from things he'll never know .
