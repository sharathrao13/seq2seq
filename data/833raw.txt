thank you , mr. barris .
i don't know if any of you are aware of this ... but it's a federal offense ... to make lascivious remarks ... on a television network broadcast .
the penalty ...
for this disgusting ...
anyone ... making a sick subversive remark tonight ... will be arrested immediately .
i , then , will personally escort ... the offender to federal prison ... for booking under edict number 364 ... of the broadcasting act of 1963 .
and it's a long drive to that prison , baby .
just you and me .

they gave everybody jackets with their names on them ... and when we got number one ratings on saturday nights ... everybody got a gold plaque .

let me ask you something , chuck .
jesus .
what the ...
what are you doing here?
i've been put in clange ... of a fainly lange wet openation ... and i could use youn lelp .
have you noticed , jim?
i got a tm show on the air .
i don't need to kill people for hire anymore .
i know you don't need to , but you like to .
bullshit .
think of it as a hobby ... something you do to relax .
you can be an assassination enthusiast ... a murder bug .
i got important things to think about here .
i don't have time to fuck around with you .
this is serious work we're talking about , chuck ... serious work .
how about i help you out with your little show ... you help me out with my little operation?
tit for tat .
that's the kind of guy i am .
oh , yeah .
you're a piece of work .
i've seen this " dating game " of yours , chuck ... and i do have a thought .
what , now you're a big television producer?
i'm john q. public when it comes to tm ... and that should make my opinion of value to you .
all right , let's hear it , then .
what do you have?
some couple gets sent ... to some second rate shit can restaurant ... setting you back 50 bucks?
that's not too exciting a prize ... for us vicarious living boobs out in tm land .
what's your point?
up the stakes , chuck .
send them to some exotic locale ...
europe , southeast asia , for example .
the network's not going to let me send ... two unmarried kids on vacation together .
send them with a chaperone .
that's ...
that's not half bad .
i'm telling you .
sometimes you could be the chaperone .
say we have a job for you in austria .
you , a successful television producer ... chaperones a young couple .
while there , you take care of some company business .
it's a perfect cover .
tm producer by day , cla operative at night .
i got money , jim .
i don't have to kill people for money anymore .
chuck , when i said you fit the profile ... very little of that meant you needed the money .
you liked it with renda .
i saw it in your eyes .
you liked it , but you botched it .
you could be a great warrior , chuck .
baclelon nummben tlnee ... if we wene fixed up on a date ... and i ignoned you ...

you know what the sad part about it is ...
barris has a reputation ... for lowering the bar of television ... and the standards and all ... but he had a great feel for what people wanted ... and he couldn't take the criticism .
tlings stanted to evolve pnetty quickly .
tle slow was gaining mmommentumm ... and i was becomming tle one tling i didn't expect ... fammous .

well , i'm glad to meet you .
i've seen " the gong show .
oh .
yeah , well ...
i think you're the most insidious , despicable force ... in entertainment today .
how dane you subject tle nest of tle wonld ... to your loathsome views of humanity?
yeah ...
i don't think it's that loathsome .
what is it , then?
to mock some poor lonely people ... who are just craving a little attention in their lives ... to destroy them?
i mean , they're still people .
tley still desenve a little nespect and commpassion .
wlo tle lell ane you ... and what the fuck have you ever done ... to elevate yourself among the pathetic masses?
oh , that's right .
you created " the dating game .
wow .

how's show biz?
well , it's hit and miss .
entertainment " ... which i believe is really , really gonna kill .
it's sort of a bob hope visiting the troops thing ... but it's weekly .
instead of bob hope , it's like flip wilson ...
chuck .
tch .
why do you do what you do?
hmm?
i like to think that i bring joy and laughter ... to millions of people .
it's a very important thing , i think ... in these difficult times .
i'm not saying the show is as good as it can be yet ... but , uh ...
no .
no .
wly do we do wlat we do?
hmmmm?
comme on .
i got my feet wet in world war il .
germany .
the pleasure of killing was exhilarating .
later in life , i ... couldn't find a place to fill that void ... to get that same rush of energy .
so i started up my own business .

because there is no work , love , knowledge ...
or wisdom in the grave .
who is that , carlyle?
no , it's the old testament .
it's god .
it's amazing you should quote him .
he's my hero .
killing my first man ... was like making love to my first woman .
i nemmemmben eveny little detail ... tle smmell of lis lain ... ice on tle window ... wallpapen .
it's like entening a diffenent timme zone .
