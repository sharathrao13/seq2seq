he came toward me .
he came toward you?
like this?
then he grabbed me .
where?
right here .
like that?
but he was much stronger than you .
like that?
he forced himself on top of me .
like that?
his breath smelled like he'd been drinking on the job , like yours .
really?
what happened next?
he kissed me .
where?
where , baby?
and he stripped me naked .
i was confused .
he ripped my shirt off .
you didn't put up much of a fight , did you?
oh , really?
i didn't put up much of a fight?
so you took control?
what did you do next?

3 : 00 .
let's go .
hey , man , you're out of paper towels again .
how you doing , chae?
good .
thought the camera only added ten pounds .
looks good , doesn't it?
kind of , in a pudgy way .
i thought this might be an opportune time to revisit my offer to invest in that business venture .
costa rica?
chartered fishing boat .
steal the evidence money?
you file a report on that yet?
is that it?
that's it .
485 grand .
can i touch it?
no , you can't .
i just want to touch it .
get your hands out of there .
maybe i'll just steal it .
maybe i'll just shoot you .
stop thinking like a cop .
just listen to my proposition .
we'll take a grand out .
we'll go to the boat show .
we'll just walk around with the money in our pocket , get a sense of what it feels like to knowwe could buy a boat .
i'll see you in a minute .
what do you think?
chae .
stranger .
how you doing?
how you doing , alex?
i need your keys .
i'm fine , thanks for asking .
how about you?
listen , i need your keys .
i left a couple of things .
okay .
i'll go with you .
no .
why not?
i just want to go with you .
i don't want to get into anything .
i got a lot of work to do today .
i know your work is important .
are you going to start with that?
i'm gonna go in the other room and pretend to make a phone call .
congrats on making detective .
thanks , chae .
forget it .
even if i left the hope diamond in there , it's just not worth it .
bye , matt .
good bye , alex .
would you just give me the goddamn keys?
they're on the desk right in front of you .
i'll drop them off .
see you .
see you , sweetie .
she looks good .
sometimes i think you want me to shoot you .
wait .
hold that thought .
medical examiner .
yeah .
all right .
what kind of prick dies at cocktail hour on a friday?
the nerve of some people .
have a good one .
yeah , see you .
catch anything?
trying to catch my self respect .
figuring out what it is i'm doing in the middle of this ... threesome .
try foursome .
you're forgetting your wife .
she left me .
i told her the other day ... told her today ... come get her stuff .
how's the pro football quarterback?
he's up north hunting for the weekend .
the whole weekend .
i got a splinter in my butt .
you okay?
i'm okay .
i'm definitely okay .
it's all right .
you still love her .
huh?
you still love her , don't you?
yeah , i do .
yeah , you do .
will you divorce her?
you still got your ring on .
chris needs me .
oh , okay .
he does .
he's lost , been that way since he got cut from the team .
i guess i feel sorry for him .
remember that the next time he goes upside your head .
okay .
sure .
all right .
i'll be right there .
ann merai .
hi .
dr. frieland .
this is my brother matt .
nice to meet you .
sorry to bring you in today .
i was in surgery all day yesterday .
please .
you can talk in front of him .
it's fine .
right .
okay .
ann , i'm afraid there's been a bit of a setback .
i had your tests back yesterday .
the cancer is not in remission .
it's come back very aggressively .
it's attacked your liver and lungs .
how long?
well , that's difficult to say .
how long?
five , six months .
no one can say for sure .
but i feel fine .
listen ... there's a counselor here at the hospital i'd like you to see .
she's very good .
she'll help you during this period .
thank you for coming in on your day off .
ann , wait .
excuse me .
maybe you could speak to her about the counseling?
listen , you should be able to do something , right?
what about that experimental stuff?
you know , like " 60 minutes "?
i don't know .
there are alternative approaches .
yeah?
sure .
let's see .
autologous cancer vaccines , hematology procedures , hyperthermia treatments .
here .
take a look at those .
they're extremely expensive , and there are no guarantees .
thanks .
okay .
you all right?
yeah .
why didn't you tell me , baby?
i'm sorry .
when i was with you ...
i forgot about it .
for a couple hours , i didn't think about dying .
i understand .
you know , they've got this alternative stuff .
there's a clinic in switzerland ...
i know .
with my blood .
i don't put much stock in all that stuff .
they said there's a 17 % chance , a 17 % success rate .
a whole 17 %?
odds are better i'd hit the lottery , which is what i'd have to do to afford something like that .
listen .
where are you going?
i don't think we should do this anymore .
it wasn't right for me to drag you into this .
you didn't drag me into anything .
i'm a big boy .
matt , i'm dying .
i'm dying .
thanks for the flowers .
you're welcome .
the girls at work were so jealous .
glad to hear that .
that's not why you called me .
what's up?
i want to show you something .
chris didn't hit you again?
no .
when we were married , we took out insurance policies on each other , but they were only for $100, 000 .
this says $1 million .
did you know about this?
no .
i remember signing things , but i didn't know he'd made changes .
he can't get away with this .
this is fraud .
you were sick .
no .
i was diagnosed six months ago .
chris increased the policy almost a year ago , right after my 32nd birthday .
my mother was 33 when she died of cancer .
oh , no .
that chris?
he's here .
maybe he can explain this .
no .
why not?
now's the time .
this is not the time .
when is the time?
i don't know .
please .
i'm sorry , baby .
i'm just taking the trash out .
thought you were working a double tonight .
yeah .
bet you did .
howwas your appointment on saturday?
appointment?
yeah , with dr. frieland .
i didn't have an appointment .
no?
you sure?
i'm sure .
'cause jay saw you go inside his office .
you were going inside with some other guy .
no , i just stopped by .
i had to ask some questions .
now you were there .
i was there , but i had to ask him some questions .
here we go with the lies again .
i'm not lying to you .
yes , you are !
start telling me the truth !
you're hurting me !
why do you make me do this?
i'm not making you do anything !
it ain't my goddamn fault !
it ain't my fault !
chris , how you doing , football player?
good , mathias .
how you doing?
i'm good .
judy anderson called , said she saw a prowler in the neighborhood .
you see anything?
what about your wife?
she home?
she didn't see anything .
you didn't ask her .
she didn't say anything about it .
maybe i should ask her , not that i don't trust your mind reading .
hey , ann , how you doing?
i didn't see anything .
i'm going to check the perimeter .
go ahead .
you see somebody , you holler .
you have a good night .
we did it .
this wasn't necessary .
my name shouldn't be on your house .
i'll buy my own in a few years .
all right .
chief whitlock .
hey , baby , it's me .
what time do you get off?
i've found a way to go to that clinic .
right .
can you talk?
hold on .
forget it .
excuse me .
i'm sorry .
you know , i've got to go .
t ell her i say hi .
bye .
is this a bad time?
can you talk?
yeah .
it's no problem .
you've got to hear this .
it's incredible .
i name you the beneficiary of my life insurance policy .
no , no .
not me personally .
you name the living gift as your beneficiary after we purchase the policy from you .
and you ...
i mean , the living gift ... collects on the policy when i die .
as the beneficiary , yes , we collect on the policy .
so you make a profit if she dies?
is that legal?
we wouldn't be here if it wasn't .
how much do i get?
the amount depends on how long your medical staff says i have to live .
how about a ballpark figure? $750, 000 .
i know .
even if they have to repeat the treatment several times , there would be enough money for us to go somewhere .
like the conch festival in key west?
no .
clambake in opa locka?
no !
europe .
europe?
yeah .
or africa .
i'm going to beat this .
you watch .
richard petty , give me a hand .
hey , man , watch it .
don't slip .
watch that blood .
come on , ann , talk to me .
their investors won't let them buy any new policies .
the living gift?
we can go somewhere else .
we'll get somebody else to buy it .
i can't .
there's only two days left to change it .
what do you mean?
a provision says the beneficiary can't be changed after a year , and that's in two days .
well , maybe we could call down ...
it's too late !
listen ...
don't , don't .
don't .
this is not fixable .
just go .
just go .
what did alex pick up from your place the other day?
i don't know .
well , over for sure now , huh?
she left something so she'd have a chance to come see you .
see if she still had feelings .
based on what i saw , she didn't have any feelings ... except anger .
think you've had enough .
i'm trying to help you here .
one of your patrons has been overserved .
i may have to cite you on that , helena .
see you tomorrow , chae .
see you tomorrow .
man .
bustin 'my chops , mr. drinking on duty .
i'll see you later .
good night .
take it easy .
let me get you a refill , chief .
no , i'm good , chris .
it ain't a bribe , just a beer .
two , whatever he was just drinking .
thank you .
let me ask you something .
that night you were out there looking for that prowler , did you see anybody?
no , i didn't .
i had this feeling when i got home that ann was with some other guy .
really?
i think he snuck out the back when i got home .
no , i didn't see anybody .
i'll tell you what , though .
next time that little pussy comes around ...
little pussy?
the guy scurries out the back door the second he hears my voice .
" scurries "?
yeah .
i could almost respect a man who had the balls to confront me , tell me , " yeah , i'm banging your wife .
maybe this guy , maybe there's nothing he would rather do than to tell you that you're a lousy husband and don't deserve ann .
maybe there's nothing he would rather do than to walk up to your face , look you in the eye , and say to you , " chris , i'm banging your wife ... good .
maybe .
you know , maybe ... your wife won't let him .
i'd respect him at least .
and if he did that , then i'd go up to him ,
look him in his eye , and i'd say ,
just come near her again ... ... and i'll kill you .
wow .
you're talking to the wrong guy , because as a police officer ...
i can't let you go around threatening people's lives .
if you're serious , i would be obligated to do something .
really?
that's right .
thanks for the beer ... and the conversation .
thanks for listening .
you give ann my best , if you can .
you been waiting long?
sorry about last night .
you must really be mad at me .
god , i used to love coming out here with you .
i thought i was the shit , being a freshman making out with a senior .
you were .
still are .
i guess i was .
here .
what's this?
my going away present .
going away?
insurance policy .
you're making me the beneficiary?
buy that fishing boat you and chae have always talked about .
right .
here .
no .
i'm leaving tomorrow .
what?
i'm leaving town tomorrow .
i've got to get out of here .
i need to get away from chris .
i need some peace .
chief whitlock .
how can i help you?
you just did , buddy .
how you doing?
good .
take this .
meet me at my house .
what is it?
it's a gift to you .
switzerland .
what?
it's money .
what money?
that drug money?
matt , no .
oh , my god .
what if they want it back?
by law , the money has to stay in the custody of the arresting department until the appeals process is over .
with the money scarcetti has , it could take years .
but tony and the guys ...
they think i'm putting it in a safe deposit box .
what time does chris get home?
11 : 30 .
go to your house , pack a bag , meet me at my house , 11 : 00 .
you okay?
see you later .
what are you doing here?
barbara's pissed off about something .
got to wait her out .
listen .
you see anybody come in here?
no .
you sure?
okay .
why don't you head over to the scuttlebutt?
they cut me off , no thanks to you .
tell them chief whitlock said everything's okay .
that's the first place barbara's going to look !
she won't look there .
she will !
i've got half a pack of cigarettes in there !
tell engine two to lay it out and start attacking it from the back !
go , go !
pull it up !
let's get moving !
1919 on 415 san juan .
that's about four miles outside of town .
go !
let's keep moving !
aim the hose right there !
mathias , you all right?
i know it's hard to take .
i'll grab you a cup of coffee .
was it an accident?
i don't know .
maybe .
these propane tanks just don't blow for no reason .
man , this place was an inferno .
those poor folks didn't have a chance .
hi , chief .
chief .
what are you doing here?
i'm a homicide detective , and there's two dead bodies .
so what happened?
they think the propane tank blew .
you knowwho they are?
i think it's definitely " were .
right , chae .
hey , mathias , check it out .
definitely arson .
it's definitely arson .
definitely .
the closer i stay to the scene , the better .
yeah , it's possibly a double homicide .
we're gonna have to take this thing over .
chief , judy anderson's mom is visiting from orlando .
last night , judy said her mom saw somebody sneaking around .
i checked it out , didn't see anything .
we should probably tell alex .
i'll tell her .
you get back to the office .
they want me to run my investigation out of your place for the next 24 .
i need your help ... background on the vics , people they knew .
a tour guide?
you cool with that?
okay .
no problem .
are you sure?
no problem at all .
why don't we ride back and you fill me in on the harrisons?
my boys will set up at your place .
okay .
great .
i just wanted to say i'm really sorry about the timing .
what do you mean?
with the papers , and then this today .
the divorce papers?
i should have called you before .
that would have been nice .
i know .
but it has been eight months .
don't you think we need closure?
i really don't want to talk about it .
thanks for opening up .
let's talk about the harrisons .
either of them screwing around?
i don't know .
is anybody happily married these days?
these have already been gone through .
right .
he was supposed to get off at 11 : 30 .
right .
mr. harrison .
so you don't know if mr. harrison came to work or not .
hold on .
did you know she worked as a dental hygienist for a dr. shider?
really?
no .
i'm going to pay him a visit .
you want to come?
okay .
thanks .
so she quit yesterday?
well , kind of .
ann merai had terminal cancer .
really?
i think she was trying to keep it quiet .
anything else you could tell us?
i think she was having an affair .
did she actually tell you she was having an affair?
we don't really talk a lot , mainly what's happening on our stories .
but i just got the feeling .
sometimes when she'd be on the phone , she would talk real quiet .
whisper?
did you ever see him , or did she tell you who he was?
no .
but he was classy .
about a week ago , she got flowers from rosie's .
really nice .
it was beautiful .
remember , bruce?
but i met her husband once , and he just doesn't seem like the type to send flowers .
right .
rosie !
chief whitlock .
listen , we're trying to find out if some flowers were sent to an ann merai harrison last week , sent to her office .
harrison .
check and see if one of your guys sent them .
what hospital?
mercy med .
chris harrison .
her husband .
okay .
thanks a lot , rosie .
yeah .
no , that's all .
thank you , rosie .
if you'd like to make a call ...
you ready?
i guess so .
okay .
all right .
thank you for your help .
sure .
thank you .
if you think of anything else , here's my card .
thanks a lot .
please don't do me like that .
you knew i wasn't finished .
i'm sorry .
dr. shider gave me the name of ann merai's doctor .
i want to find out more about her cancer .
you can drop me off back at the station .
you really don't like being around me , do you?
no .
i just , you know ...
there isn't any reason for both of us to be wasting time at the doctor's office .
what's so pressing that you have to do?
i do have a job .
i am chief of police .
yeah , of a four person department , matt .
that's the problem between the two of us .
you think your job is more important than my job .
never said that .
yeah , you did .
you never say it directly , but in indirect ways you say it .
you wanted to leave banyan key so we could be closer to your important job .
you never said the commute was taking time away from us?
i didn't have a problem with that .
you didn't?
so i'm hearing things now?
whatever .
is that the reason you're not coming?
is that your date paging you?
one of my four officers checked in .
it's a tracking device .
and you can tell on that?
that's what it tells me .
gps .
we're all tied into it .
the mayor's brother sells them , so we spent half the budget on them .
see , if we were moving , you'd see it tracking .
sorry .
if we were moving right now , it would show us tracking .
great .
why don't we drive to the doctor's office , and i can see how it works?
i'm going to the bathroom .
i'll meet you in there .
hi .
may i help you?
yeah .
dr. donovan's office .
her office is on the third floor .
thank you , ramona .
ann harrison didn't have cancer .
are you sure?
not counting the time she spent in atlanta ,
ann merai has been my patient since junior high .
if she had cancer , i would have known about it .
i don't get it .
maybe she saw another doctor .
she was here for her yearly when she first got back to town two months ago , and she was healthy as a proverbial horse .
i'm looking it over here , and ...
i don't understand .
who told you she had cancer?
excuse me .
so ...
can i help you?
yeah , i'm looking for dr. frieland .
you're looking at him .
you're dr. frieland?
yes , i am .
hold on , pop .
you're sure?
this is your office?
it has been for ten years , yes .
look , i'll get back to you .
do you have a patient named ann merai harrison?
i really can't tell you that .
you can tell me .
was she your patient or not?
was she your patient or not?
was she your patient or not?
no , i've never had a patient by that name .
you sure?
yes , i'm sure , very sure .
yeah , i would know that .
okay , i'm sorry .
that your pen?
pen?
yes .
do you use it much?
no , not very much .
you don't mind if i take it , do you?
no , you can have the pen .
sure .
it's yours .
take it .
it's yours .
right .
right .
i know that part .
hang on one sec .
did you get a checkup or something?
no .
just bad coffee .
all right .
no , just tell them they've got to stop lagging .
we need those phone records now .
all right .
thanks .
you all right?
yeah .
we all good?
fantastic .
how's this , ma'am?
you fixed his nose already?
just wonderful .
hey , chief .
how you doing , judy?
i'm fine , thanks , considering ...
alex , we've got an eyewitness here .
mr. anderson , this is detective diaz whitlock .
well , just ...
we're on top of it .
i told them how judy's mom saw somebody sneaking around the harrison place last night .
got them right over there sketching it out for us . ... the guy she saw outside her window ...
that's her right there?
good job .
chief , check this out .
sketch of a prowler out to the harrisons 'last night .
look .
ring any bells?
hi , tony .
no .
i mean , no .
he looked like him .
like who?
like him .
like me?
yeah .
you .
mom , he's the chief of police .
so he was black , ma'am?
yeah , he was black .
wait a minute .
maybe him .
mrs. anderson , thank you .
thank you very , very much .
anyway ...
i'm so sorry .
mother was raised in a different time .
don't worry about it .
we're on top of it , okay?
i need to talk to you .
i appreciate you coming down .
i am so embarrassed .
please , you've got to stop .
i want you to take this up to miami for me , okay?
i want you to give it to a detective gissen .
gissen?
gissen , right .
i'm going to give you his number .
i need prints on that asap .
is it for this thing?
yeah .
excuse me , chief .
yeah .
an agent stark from the dea is on line one for you .
who?
agent stark .
said it's about the scarcetti case .
thank you .
chief whitlock .
agent stark , dea .
how you doing?
busy .
you and me both , pal .
i understand you guys are holding evidence in the scarcetti case .
great .
that makes you my new best friend .
i'm going to send some agents this aftemoon to pick up that cash .
we think it was used last year in a sting operation with paolo estaban .
if we can tie the serial numbers to the bills you guys have , we can tie estaban to scarcetti .
this is a top priority for us , chief .
with this evidence , we can kill two birds with one stone , nail estaban and scarcetti .
why don't i call you tomorrow , and we figure out a time ...
this had to be done the day before yesterday .
we've got a court date next week .
the evidence has to stay with me until the appeals process is over .
i didn't call you to get a lecture on the rules of evidence .
we need to check the serial numbers , and that's what we're going to do .
when i hang up on you in ten seconds ,
i want you to type up a chain of evidence receipt .
one of my men will be happy to sign it for you this aftemoon .
oh , yeah , and , chief ...
yeah?
it's been ten seconds .
chief , you okay?
yeah .
fine .
just tell gissen that i need those prints really quick .
i'm sure alex can ...
we don't want to give them to alex .
sorry .
i just thought ...
just do it !
all right .
okay .
i'm sorry .
i'm very sorry .
just go there , stay there , and call me as soon as they're done .
you got it .
no , i've been on hold .
when should i call back?
okay .
thanks .
here you go .
baste , my phone records !
how long can it take to fax over a few sheets of paper?
i'll call them again .
alex , i think we got something here .
what?
look at this entry into the checkbook , that last one .
is this the only entry you found?
so far , but it's a new register .
what's going on?
they got a life insurance policy , and we've got a potential murder .

you're sure it's not 1099?
chae , 0199 .
0199?
that's weird .
that's my cell phone number .
yours?
yeah .
aren't you county?
i work part time as a paramedic ... football games , school stuff .
and you called him last night?
i don't know .
did i ...?
oh , jesus , i did call him last night .
i called him from the bar .
i wanted to see if he wanted to have a couple of drinks .
you're friends with him?
i wouldn't say that .
he's , like , my bottom of the list guy when you've got to have somebody to drink with .
i would have mentioned it .
i totally forgot .
you should have told me this at the scene , chae .
i'm sorry .
i don't remember too much about last night .
i had a fight with barbara .
i was in no good shape .
check with the bartender ...
i closed the place , staggered home , passed out next to my wife .
i didn't move until i got the call to show up at the scene .
i need a statement .
i'll give you a statement right now .
what's the matter with you?
you're like a love child of barney fife and joe friday .
all right , a statement .
what was that about?
i was sleeping with her .
jesus .
so you didn't ...
no , but it was all a plan , them coming back here .
they set me up , planned the whole thing .
what plan?
what do you mean?
i gave her the scarcetti money .
god !
would you have given it to me if i slept with you?
any trace of the money?
none .
i thought i had trouble with women .
maybe you should just tell her .
who , alex?
yeah .
tell alex .
are you out of your mind?
look what they've got on me .
motive ...
ann merai names me beneficiary on her insurance policy , and i was having an affair with her .
opportunity ... an eyewitness saw me outside their house the night it blew up .
you want to hear some more?
alibi .
home , by myself .
that good?
at least you changed your cell phone number .
even if alex wanted to believe me , there's so much evidence against me , she'd have to turn me in .
you're right .
that'd kill any chance of getting back together .
what?
she says , " let's call the divorce off .
what are you talking about?
i'm looking at murder charges .
the gal's a peach .
i don't know what you were thinking .
never mind .
forget it .
can i do anything?
you don't think obstruction of justice is enough?
i'm on a roll .
chief whitlock .
they matched the prints on the pen .
the guy's name is paul cabot .

you've been really helpful .
i'm sorry i couldn't be more ...
wait a minute .
wait a minute .
i got a note here .
the policy holder requested a form to change the beneficiary last week .
so she changed it?
if she did , it hasn't made it in the system yet .
so what does that mean?
is that in the mail , or ...
it could be downstairs in our processing center .
waiting to be processed .
can you connect me?
i think they're still out to lunch .
all right , so call back in half an hour?

we all had the funny idea that you were dead .
i'm sorry , matt .
i'm so sorry .
i'm so sorry .
where's chris?
oh , god , i've lied to you so much .
he forced me to do this .
he and his friend paul found out about the scarcetti thing .
they stole bodies from the morgue .
you switched the dental records .
i had to .
i had to .
they said they'd kill me .
see , paul was a criminal , matt .
he was?
yes .
he was killed today .
they made me do this .
now it looks like you and i faked my death to collect on the insurance policy .
so what do you want me to do?
i don't want to have to face them and have to answer questions about this .
i gotta get out of town , but i don't know where to go .
and i need money .
so where's chris?
you're right .
i should have come to you earlier .
he's there , isn't he?
yes .
i would have contacted you earlier , but i knew you would think it was another trick .
i don't blame you .
he beat me up and ...
matt?
yeah .
he beat me up and ...
see , paul had the money ...
i have the money .
no , i don't want to involve you in any more of this .
where are you?

agent stark , dea .
i'm looking for chief whitlock .
how much was it?
485, 000 .
did he arrange to have it picked up or dropped off?
he told my agents he was sending it to my office .
nobody showed .
i'm sure it was just miscommunication .
that's a . 38 , chris .
only six shots .
give me the gun .
give me the gun !
he's gone .
you all right?
give me the gun .
wait a minute .
you said he beat you up .
it was self defense .
no jury would convict you .
just put the gun down .
you think chris did this to my face?
i think you should put your gun on the floor .
what?
put it down .
i didn't think i could do this , but i will .
you set this up .
put your gun on the floor .
are you sure?
don't do this .
where's the money?
come on .
jesus !
so you ...
we didn't mean anything to each other?
it's not important .
that's not important now .
it was just all an act?
where's the money?
look me in the eye and tell me you didn't mean any of it .
some of it !
don't try to confuse me !
i don't have any choice now .
you don't have to do this .
i've known you all your life .
you're not a criminal .
you know i know you ...
stop !
what? !
okay .
all right , high school sweetheart .
you think i'm playing?
i'm not playing .

don't shoot me .
i'm just gonna reach for it .
show me !
here it is .
put it down .
wait , don't shoot me .
i'm sorry .
i'm so sorry .
i'm the one that got you the money .
i'm trying to save your life .
it wasn't all an act .
i can't live broke .
life ain't shit when you're broke .
shit !
wait !
wait , no !
oh , my god .

no , i'm fine .
i'm at the end of runyon road on the dock .
hurry .
did you kill paul cabot?
no ...
it was self defense .
he was attacking me .
i was trying to get the money back .
you were just gonna hand the money back?
that's what i was trying to do .
then what's that over there?
what do you got?
chris and ann harrison's bodies are upstairs .
the real ones .
they were both working for cabot .
chief found out they were here and took care of business , right?
right .
let's move .
good job .
thank you .
thank you very much .
your guy never showed up , whitlock .
agent stark?
yeah .
i don't care if you're injured or not .
i want that evidence money , or you're gonna be looking at a case ...
where the hell is southeast 63rd street in miami?
53rd street .
i told you 53rd street , not 63rd .
no , you did not .
yes , i did .
i said southeast 53rd ...
you said , " those assholes in the dea are at 8400 southeast 63rd street .
i didn't .
i'm very sorry .
what i said was , " those assholes from the dea are at 8400 southeast 53rd .
63rd .
never mind .
just give them the money .
give them the money .
you don't have to count it .
it's all there .

come on .
assholes .
it is all there , right?
most of it .
it's all there .
that's a pretty good one .
nice touch .
a little over the top .
which part?
your part .
you're the one that came in here screaming .
what happened to you , man?
just never leave your wife .
that's what happened to me .
i'd take the bullet .
be careful there .
it's a classic .
that grille work comes from france .
how you feeling?
excuse us .
yes , ma'am .
did you love her?
no .
why would you do this , then?
because i'm ...
because i'm stupid .
because ...
i thought i was doing the right thing , trying to help her , but it's no excuse .
sometimes people , you know , do stupid things .
especially when they're still in love .
thank you .
let's go .
how you doing?
i thought you were chae .
he called all worked up about something .
okay .
you want to sit down?
yeah .
how you doing?
good .
i asked that already?
yes .
i said i was good .
you want a beer?
yes .
i don't have any left .
you can share mine , though .
so what brings you out this way?
i just needed to move the rest of my stuff .
that's cool , i guess .
the house is a mess .
this came for you at the station .
you opened it?
you opened my mail?
why you always opening my mail?
just read it .
they just want you to fill out the forms .
to claim amount payable to the beneficiary for the sum of $1 million .
what?
we're rich .
we're rich .
how about that? $1 million .
easy , chae .
he can't take that money .
i can't take the money?
why not?
it's a conflict of interest .
he's the legal beneficiary .
i am the legal beneficiary .
and he's one of the arresting officers .
what the hell's that got to do with anything?
tell him how much trouble you can get in .
it's a million bucks !
it's the chance of a lifetime !
no !
as his wife , i'm telling you he's not taking that money .
as my wife?
as your wife .
come on .
come on , don't fall for that .
what do you mean , as my wife?
as your wife .
you said you came to move your stuff .
i'm moving back in .
this is great .
congratulations .
it's kind of fortuitous .
you serious?
yeah .
are you gonna behave?
i'm actually afraid to leave you by yourself .
you won the sweepstakes , man .
you can do this later .
it's a million bucks .
let's not lose focus .
you know , a honeymoon fund , a nursery wing for the ...
this is the golden pot at the end of the storm thing !
just sign it before you go in , huh?
i'm not gonna let you do this to yourself .
i'm gonna be sitting out here when you're finished .
i can wait three minutes .
i'm a patient man .
i am a patient man .
come on !
