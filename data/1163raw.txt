i know you think maybe i'm just trying to pull you up .
pull me up?
pick me up .
yes .
there is that chance .
but you are the one who grabbed me and pretend i'm your husband .
you're probably one of those crazy american women
like 'charlie's angels , 'and you are going to kung fu me and steal my car .
but i'm willing to take the chance .
you're willing?
what is your name?
marcello .
of course it is .

uncle , i want an ice cream .
you want an ice cream?

nice and big .
this is your bar?
we are a family .
i work here .
and i sleep there .
above my cousin's antique store .
did you ever taste this?
what is that?
it's limoncello .
we made this .
you made it?
yeah .
we take the lemon , and we take off the skin of the lemon , and then we put in the bottle with 3/ 4 of alcohol and 1/ 4 of sugar .
and you put the skin of the lemon in the bottle , and you leave it until it's dried color .
and i forget the rest .
but just try it .
do you like it?
i like it .
you got your ice cream .
bravo .
my nephew .

he does , does he?
esattamente .
ciao , piccolo , ciao .
ciao .
i run into you in the street in rome , and now we're here .
didn't you have plans today?
didn't you have something you had to do?
so what?
if you smash into something good , you should hold on until it's time to let go .
and now is not the time .
not in my opinion .
no .
you have beautiful eyes , francesca .
i wish i could swim inside them .
what?
no .
it's just that's exactly what american women think italian men say .
i guess .
thank you .
marcello , i'm sorry .
i'm so sorry .
i'm sorry .
i'm really nervous , you know .
i was married for a long time .
and since then , there hasn't been anybody .
would you like to help me change that?
you are asking me to sleep with you?
yes .
that is exactly the kind of thing we italian men think american women say .
you honor me with your offer .
francesca .
yes?
i'm going to make love all over you .
mamma mia !
che bella spalla .
what is spalla?
shoulder .
and what do you call this?
la gola .
and this?
il capezzolo .
il capezzolo .
and this?
esausto .
exhausted?
exhausted .
at least for the next 5 minutes .
me too .
it's terrible that you bought that villa in cortona .
why?
because it's not in positano , and i am .
you have to promise to come back here .
promise me .
when?
can you come this weekend?
i think so .
you think so?
you think so?

i still got it .
i still got it !
thank god !
oh , yeah .
buongiorno .
buongiorno !
do i still look sad to you?
no .
ladybugs , katherine .
lots and lots of ladybugs .
lovely .
when do you see him again?
tomorrow .
what?
i would have told you i was coming , but you would have talked me out of flying .
oh , look at you !
god damn it , frances .
i ...
what?
i gotta go pee !
you must be so exhausted .
pbht !
see this?
tell me there's a baby in there .
big old baby in there .
right now .
i'm with you .
oh , jeez .
so , what's it like having one of these in cortona?
i hear the town midwife's good .
she puts a knife under the bed to cut the pain .
florence is an hour away .
you're gonna deliver this baby in a hospital gown designed by armani .
she ran out on me .
she said she realized she didn't want to be a mother after all .
oh , disaster , frances .
how do you do it?
how do you ever breathe again?
pretty soon .
god , i missed you .
marcello , i really think i'd better stay here .
oh , i'm sorry .
how about next weekend?
okay , well how about the one after that?
no , of course , i understand .
i won't forget you .
i think a lot about you , too .
okay .
well , until then .
bye .
there's something strange about these trees .
it's like they know .
and they know that we know that they know .
they're creepy .
creepy italian trees .
the baby's gonna like them
'cause it's gonna be a creepy italian baby who goes around saying , 'ciao , mamma , 'and doing that backward hand wave thing .
life is strange .
where were you going when i arrived?
nowhere important .
what's he like?
he's a creepy italian .
so go see him .
i will .
i want to spend time with my creepy american friend .
i refuse to screw up your love life .
don't be ridiculous , patti .
you are my love life .
frances , could you come up here , please?
there's hot water in the toilet bowl .
oh , my god .
that's close to boiling .
mm hmm .
they must have crossed a pipe somewhere .
oh , this is really bad , isn't it?
well , it's not good , unless you want to give your ass a facial .
that's a contradiction in terms .
i guess it'd be more of an ass cial .
oh , god .
go .
go , go , go .
i'm sorry , frances !
he's sorry .
we have nowhere else to be together .
what does that make me?
saint francesca , patron saint of horny teenagers?
pawel , you were doing it in my bed .
i don't even do it in my bed .
please , francesca , help us .
my father don't let us see each other .
maybe he thinks you're young and shouldn't be ...
it's because i'm polish .
it will be terrible if we are not together .
'assassinate . 'did you say 'assassinate '?
did she say you were going to assassinate somebody?
no , she misunderstand .
i didn't say ...
amore , i didn't say , 'assassino . '
i said , 'i'm going to ask nino 'for money to help us get married .
oh !
'ask nino . 'oh !
i didn't understand .
married?
you barely understand what the other is saying .
we are in love .
and i go with him this weekend .
to the flag throwing festival .
i am going to throw the flag .
throw the flag .
why?
because i can do it as good as any italian man .
that's why .
and her father will see .
francesca?
francesca?
my father .
francesca .
placido , hi .
my daughter says you are taking her to the festa in montepulciano .
this is true?
just a moment , please .
i told him you're taking me so he will stay home .
i don't want to lie to your father .
come on , frances .
who cares?
frances?
if i am not with her , i will die of a broken heart .
you won't die .
isn't he great?
oh , there he is !
these are straight men .
in tights twirling flags .
fantastic !
yeah .
oh , this is it !
he is fantastic !
fantastico !
whoo !
yay !
bravo !
bravo !
pawel , i love you !
pawel !
mi scusi .
pawel !
oh , oh .
easy .
easy .
easy .
mi scusi .
i throw the flag .
si , amore .
they're fine .
let's go .
what is it about love that makes us so stupid?
take the man with the flowers .
same deal every day .
i mean , enough already .
why can he just let it go and get over it?
francesca , you see my daughter?
she seems so different .
really?
oh , chiara is not herself .
maybe do you know what's bothering her?
placido , i don't know .
hey , frances , look .
you can see bramasole from here .
see?
thank you .
it's marcello !
oh , my god !
wait a minute .
what?
what's he doing?
don't go !
where are you going?
patti !
marcello !
marcello !
wait !
marcello !
we tried you on your cell , but you were in a dead zone .
i cannot believe you let him leave .
he said he couldn't wait .
couldn't wait?
why?
he was on his way to arezzo .
he was nearby and thought he'd take a shot .
he was very disappointed , okay?
you've got a snail in your ear .
good .
really?
no !
get it out !
he left you a note .
hold still .
he's going north for a couple of weeks .
oh , my god .
he had a dream about me in a white dress .
a white dress?
holy shit !
damn it , patti , why didn't you make him wait?
i mean , come on , you're a tough dyke .
you could have tied him to a chair !
you could have faked labor at least !
i wouldn't have had to fake it .
ten fingers .
ten toes .
i commend you on a classic choice .
what's her name , mom?
alexandra .
in italian , the literal translation of 'to give birth , '
'dare alla luce , 'is to give to the light .
alexandra .
welcome to the light .
all right .
hi !
yes !
yes !
hello , sweetheart .
alexandra .
alexandra .
okay , i can ...
hey , baby .
oh , you're so cute .
you're so cute .
frances .
we are finished .
poland .
dziekuje .
dziekuje .
come back soon .
i'll cook for you .
pawel , you too?
chiara is waiting !
patti , you want to come with me to town?
we could bring the baby .
i have to buy a white dress .
excuse me .
could you give me a lift?
with pleasure .
grazie .
grazie .
i could wait and take you back .
thanks , but i've got my boyfriend .
marcello !
marcello !
francesca .
wait there , i'm coming down .
francesca .
look how beautiful you are .
it's incredible to see you .
every time we made plans , it didn't happen .
so this time , i thought i'll surprise you .
i am surprised .
what brings you to positano?
what brings me to positano?
what brings me to positano?
marcello .
we're going to be late .
one moment , darling .
i'll be right there .
i came at a bad time .
francesca , wait .
wait .
wait !
i'm sorry you're hurt .
but what did you expect?
what did i expect?
you came to bramasole .
you left that note .
i thought that you ...
wait .
just a minute .
months ago , we had a beautiful affair .
and if you think i wanted more of you after that , you're right .
because i did , of course .
you're a fantastic woman , francesca .
but we were never able to come together again , even though we tried .
and this sort of thing must come naturally .
i told you .
there was my friend .
she was going to have a baby .
there were many , many other things .
important things you had to do .
and you couldn't wait .
right?
don't worry , francesca .
don't worry .
there is nothing to regret .
do you regret this?
i don't ...
there is someone for you , francesca .
goodbye .
francesca !
she's in the fountain !
who is in the fountain?
the crazy blonde !
what's going on here?
she is sylvia in 'la dolce vita . '
she's very good , actually .
is she drunk?
i hope so .
you know , in 'la dolce vita , 'he goes in and he gets her .
mastroianni .
he goes in , and he fishes her out .
katherine .
thank you .
do you think i make a good sylvia?
you were wonderful .
here .
i see zeus is gone .
back to mount olympus .
i'm so sorry .
don't be .
i'm fine now .
there's nothing like a fountain and a magnum of french champagne to put you right again .
really?
what do you think?
you know who i really love the most from all the films?
cabiria .
you remember at the end when another man has left her in the most terrible way , and she thinks it's all over for her?
then she sees some children playing in the street , making music .
and before she knows it ... she's smiling again .
that's what fefe always said .
no matter what happens ... always keep your childish innocence .
it's the most important thing .
you're back?
what happened?
how'd it go with marcello?
i don't want to talk about it .
chiara's here .
she's upset .
she's out in the garden talking with pawel .
i can't talk about it now .
oh .
fran .
stupid .
stupid !
what more can i do?
it's okay .
it's not your fault .
babbo .
i want to ask your permission to marry your daughter .
it's nice , but it's out of the question .
i have come here to ask your permission to marry your daughter .
i will love her forever , and i know that i will make her happy .
all young men say this .
sometimes it's true .
never .
never?
what about you two?
don't be ridiculous .
i hate him half of the time .
placido , don't you want chiara to be happy in love?
happy .
happy is about a lot of things .
it's not just about young passion .
this doesn't last , chiara , and when it's over , what you will have left is nothing .
he has nothing to offer you .
i have everything to offer her .
everything .
pawel , let's go .
chiara !
wait .
wait .
won't you give your blessing?
what if this is it?
the real thing .
a love that lasts forever .
what you describe is all in fairy tales .
no , it's not .
and how do you know?
from personal experience?
no , i looked for it , and i didn't find it .
but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist .
that's exactly what it means .
no one has had it .
i did !
i had a great love .
mamma !
your father ... a great love .
and i'll never forget it .
mamma !
mamma !
he's a poor polish laborer .
he is nobody .
he has no family !
that's not true .
he has me .
i'm his family .
i'm his family .
chiara .
pawel .
amen .
amen .
amen .
amen .
okay , yes .
okay .
mamma !
what are you thinking?
what do i think?
tell me .
i think you got your wish .
my wish?
that day we looked for your snake you said to me that you wanted there to be a wedding here .
yeah .
and you said you wanted there to be a family here .
you're right .
i got my wish .
i got everything that i asked for .
mi scusi .
you are looking for the american writer who lives here , and you found her .
if you don't mind , i'll just ...
there .
it was crawling on you .
a ladybug .
do i know you?
not really .
you reviewed one of my books once .
did i like it?
not very much .
oh , no .
don't worry .
it was , by far , the very best bad review i've ever received .
you're kidding .
i'm not .
it helped me get to my next book .
anyway , i've been traveling around tuscany .
someone said that you lived up here .
i'm ed .
hi .
i'm frances .
hi .
there's a wedding going on .
this isn't your wedding .
that would be unfortunate .
they say they built the train tracks over the alps before there was a train that could make the trip .
they built it anyway .
they knew one day the train would come .
any arbitrary turning along the way , and i would be elsewhere .
i would be different .
what are four walls , anyway?
they are what they contain .
the house protects the dreamer .
unthinkably good things can happen , even late in the game .
it's such a surprise .
