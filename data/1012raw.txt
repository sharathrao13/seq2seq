and i thought turtle doves were female pigeons .
and i thought weasels were female badgers .

and i thought men and women were two different species .

so you were in bangkok?
yup .
tell me about it .
what do you want to know?
i hear whores are in aquariums .
yup , and they're usually naked .
how much do they go for?
a blow job is 0500 thai baths .
that's the same in czech crowns .
a fuck is 500 or 1000 .
sometimes you can get both for a grand .
what about kissing?
kissing?
that's most expensive of all .
it il run you at least 2500 .
you didn't know that?
i guess i forgot .
tell me about this girl .
the girl you're about to meet is absolutely one of a kind .
she's modest , intelligent , but mostly she's self sacrificing .
a pretty rare combination .
is she seeing anyone now?
every girl's seeing someone unless she's seeing you .
or should i say , me .
you've had a girlfriend for three years .
i don't get ...
why you want to meet this girl .
'cause our relationship's shaky .
this might be worth filming .
it was a joke .
a stupid one .
okay if i film you arguing?
we're not going to argue .
are you mental?
hang on .
i thought you said your relationship was shaky .
i did not .
think that's funny?
you're really pushing it .
wait a minute .
all i did was help you realize you've come to a dead end .
thanks .
my consciously acting like a swine has cleansed you .
i've pointed out how ridiculous your lives are .
next time we need something ...
we il definitely let you know .
you wanted to know if she was the right girl for you .
that means i'm not .
then let s do something .
like what?
all we can do is flip a coin .
what are you talking about?
you heard me .
heads we stay together , tails we break up .
okay .
i il flip .
you mean you'd actually do it?
it was your idea .
isn't it odd for two grown people to decide whether or not to break up by flipping a coin?
yeah , i guess it is .
come on in .
awesome pad .
don't turn it off .
awesome tune .
what is it?
the national anthem , bonehead .
oh , yeah .
i haven't heard the instrumental version lately , so i forgot it .
is there something you want?
huh?
you want something?
yeah , of course .
it's in my car .
do you know they got monkeys dealing drugs in thailand?
what kind of monkeys?
gibbons .
how could they do that?
like anyone else .
they deliver packages and collect money just like you do .
hang on .
are you implying i'm a monkey?
let me tell you something , pal .
you're a total burn out .
you're thirty years old ...
i'm twenty nine .
who cares?
you're a loser .
you quit school , you work as a moving man ...
you're constantly stoned , and you hardly know your own name .
hey , you're right .
i am thirty .
meanwhile you could be the master of your own destiny .
you could play an active role in the story of your life .
you keep smoking weed and you il be a basket case by 35 .
or you come to your senses , and take hold of your destiny .
there is some truth to that .
it's entirely up to you .
what do you think i should do?
cocaine .
holy shit !
promise you il think about it .
i can do that .
what do i want you to do?
think about it !
okay .
i il think about it .
are you serious about me?
you bet .
sure this isn't just about sex?
excuse me?
we just met .
i don't even know your sign .
what is your sign?
does it matter?
would you be a capricorn?
why?
they don't like saying what sign they are .
then i'm a capricorn .
you are?
that's good .
what can i get you?
a rapid and ...
a regular shot for055 or a body shot for 155?
a regular shot .
wait .
what's a body shot?
you put salt behind your ear , lemon ...
i'd have to show you .
then show us .
i'd have to demonstrate ...
... on her .
go ahead , then .
i'm no guinea pig .
find someone else , okay?
yuck !
i'm all sticky !
what time do you get off work?
you two will be asleep by then .
that's my sister .
dear friends , back in prep school ...
back in high school ...
would you mind if we had a few people over?
of course not .
who?
travel agency clients .
czechs?
no , more like japanese .
japanese again !
they want to see how a typical czech family lives .
how do you envision this?
will we have to wear costumes?
will i have to act like a fool or dress up as a plumber?
why would you have to dress up as a plumber?
i don't know .
did i say , as a plumber?  yes , you did .
that was just one way i could make a fool of myself .
you won't have to do that .
they il come over .
they il watch us eat , walk the dog ...
do we have a dog?
we could borrow one .
nothing against the japanese , but our family is sacred to me .
i respect what we've built .
our family is a private matter .
i don't want tourists eyeing us .
very nicely put .
dear friends ...
some years ago ...
excellent .
that's it .
some years ago ...
a break up?
you leave a piece of your soul with everyone you break up with .
the missing piece is what hurts .
because it's not with you .
eventually it comes back to you , but it takes a long time .
sometimes i see blue lights on people .
they're pieces of the souls of people who used to love you .
sometimes they're the hopes your parents had for you .
that's the second kind .
everyone's covered with lights .
really .
the japanese have even invented a way to measure it .
the japanese , huh?
they know how to measure it .
why don't i drive instead?
why?
i'm fine .
really?
no pressure .
i understand .
it can mess up your short term memory .
but it can help your long term one .
holy shit !
don't move him !
his spine could be messed up .
he's pinned in here .
shouldn't we call an ambulance?
i used to drive an ambulance .
really?
really .
we're not moving him , right?
of course not .
i'm just looking at the way he's pinned in there .
we're not moving him , right?
no .
his spine could be messed up .
some years ago my girlfriend left me .
i was so upset that i would have done anything just to see her .
i even dressed up as a plumber to get into her apartment .
for two years i followed her around and walked by her house .
i left flowers on her doorstep .
his idea of an atypical speech .
yet i knew something complex and mysterious was guiding me .
my brain .
so instead of devoting my life to that girl ,
i devoted it to the human brain .
thank you .
thank you , professor .
tonight proves you didn't make such a bad choice .
excuse me , i have an emergency .
i understand .
such is the life of a neurosurgeon .
in recent years neurosurgery has made great strides ...
we can move my stuff tomorrow , jakub .
will you come pick me up?
now we il apply ...
do you have that?
yes , i do .
this is petr .
this band will be coming to prague ...
and now for a new contest called record your mother .
send me tapes of your mothers for all our listeners to hear .
now for something i think is really good .
we never see you .
you go to bars and you look like a druggie .
it's that lifestyle of yours .
and those friends of yours ...
you got sick of her so you sent her packing .
some boyfriend you are !
that's not him .
he's just helping me move .
then go on in .
i've never met your friends .
it was petr .
you know him .
petr?
that petr?
i knew he'd send you packing from the minute i saw him .
why isn't petr helping you if he sent you packing?
he didn't send me packing .
we just broke up .
some life you lead .
listen to that cough .
it's that lifestyle of yours again .
it's from the air here .
where?
at our house?
no , the prague air .
it's that lifestyle of yours !
and those friends of yours , for christ's sake .
keep your hands off her !
you let everyone touch you .
goodbye .
i il just be staying for a few nights .
no problem .
hi !
hi , dad .
we're glad you're here .
i don't get it .
why are you like this when dad and i are so happy?
i'm not all that happy .
yes , you are .
happy is what she will never be !
have his relatives been by?
no .
strangers brought him in .
let me see that .
are these their names?
yes .
do you know them?
no , why?
never heard of them .
on the contrary .
doctor?
i'm sorry .
this apartment looks fine .
it's too luxurious .
and the lady in south prague?
she lives alone .
it's sad to say , but yours is the only typical family around .
sorry , but my family is sacred .
we will not perform for anyone .
this doesn't belong here , but this girl is interesting .
could they go to her house?
no , to her parents 'house .
she has excellent parents .
her mother's especially crazed .
and they'd go for it .
listen , i've got to go .
take it easy .
bye !
hi , ondrej !
what a coincidence !
hanka !
what are you doing here?
i have a meeting .
what are you up to?
i'm in school .
great !
how about your boyfriend?
we're still together .
i'm glad to hear that .
i heard him on the radio .
really?
i listen to him on the radio sometimes .
can i give you a hug?
a hug?
just as friends .
sure .
some time ago i made a private agreement with god .
that i'd become a doctor on account of you .
and once i'd saved enough lives , god would give you back to me .
oh ...
last night i operated on the man you brought in .
did you?
how is he?
fine .
and it was a sign .
what kind of sign?
i don't know yet , but it seemed like a sign .
i operated on the same person you brought to the hospital .
that surely is a sign !
a sign we should live together .
come off it !
i'm sorry .
it was just a joke .
i wasn't really serious .
i just wanted to ...
i have to go .
fine .
take it easy , bye .
bye !
that was not good .
i should've left god out of it .
that was not good .
so you want me to pretend i'm your girlfriend?
exactly .
mom would be really happy .
she's really attached to me .
it wouldn't be right .
she wants me to live well .
don't you live well?
i live like a pig .
a pig?
don't you have a girlfriend?
nope .
couldn't someone else do this?
the point is that i look good .
i'm faithful to you .
we know each other well .
you respect me .
get it?
do i say we're getting married?
that you can leave out .
you can say you liked my screenplay .
you wrote a screenplay?
not yet , but you can say that .
hi , patient !
so this is mom , and this is vesna .
hello .
she's my girlfriend .
i'm faithful to her .
we love each other .
does he still drink a lot?
not anymore .
he's improved .
are you still a buddhist?
why haven't you visited me?
i was in bangkok .
where?
in bangkok .
it's in thailand .
did you sleep with prostitutes?
no , i was writing a screenplay .
a screenplay?
it's very good .
really?
see?
he never lets me read anything .
did he smoke marijuana there?
no , he quit .
he always says no when i offer .
you offer it to him?
not anymore .
i quit , too .
he's a good influence on me .
and on everyone else .
can i use the bathroom?
what's this supposed to mean?
i needed a way to pick her up .
i said i wanted to cheer you up .
and she's enjoying it .
aren't you pleased that i'm so playful?
not really .
but i get my inability to take things seriously from you .
it didn't bother you at all when we used to cry as kids .
you told us to cry , that tears are a good oral disinfectant .
must you always joke around?
you're the one who's joking .
you aren't really sick .
will you ever love me?
how can you expect to succeed if nothing is sacred to you?
find a steady relationship .
i'm thinking of buying a dog .
gary gilmore was a mass murderer who received the death penalty .
he was also an organ donor , so strangers got his organs .
this song's about the guy who was given gary's eyes .
he had to look at life through gary gilmore's eyes .
no , thanks .
i'm not interested .
hello .
do you have a lighter?
yeah , i think so .
can i have a light?
hang on .
i have to find it .
here it is .
hey , i have the same one !
goodbye .
do you want to go somewhere?
like where?
out for a drink?
no , i don't .
can i kiss you?
yup .
isn't there an extra charge?
for what?
i thought kissing was the most expensive .
i have no idea .
i guess that's just in bangkok .
you were in bangkok?
you bet .
really?
yup .
tell me about it .
the whores are in aquariums .
cool .
how much do girls charge for tricks?
fellatio's 500 .
what?
a blow job .
intercourse costs 500 or maybe 1000 .
sometimes you can get both for 1000 baths .
that's the same in czech crowns .
and kissing costs the most .
it's at least 2500 .
2500?
you didn't know that?
nope .
did you?
let's not waste time chatting .
that's intense .
slow down .
that's harsh .
unbelievable ...
none of my friends could ever be president .
are those people your friends?
yup .
ice?
nope .
they're all my friends , and they're all living a lie .
they're lucky i'm around to point that out to them .
that's my project .
who's that girl?
a friend .
why?
do you know her family?
yeah .
pretty loony .
her mom's especially crazed .
in what way?
she acts like my mom .
why?
so you all know each other here .
why are you in this country?
on account of ufos .
ufos .
yup .
the soil here is good , so they can fly low .
can't they do that anywhere else?
nope .
you're insane !
i've never asked a girl this before , but what's your sign?
i was walking down an odd street ...
and i had the feeling i was in a foreign city like tokyo , japan
i've never been to tokyo , but i imagine it's a cold place .
and that's how i feel today .
gee , what happened?
this song's about what's inside me today .
are you coming to bed?
you can turn off the light .
i broke up with my girlfriend because ...
we just broke up ...
because we're both looking for someone who won't go looking for somebody else .
and until we find that person , we il keep looking on our own .
it's pretty complex .
i guess there's no solution .
but that doesn't matter .
that doesn't matter ...
what?
my back hurts , so i'm working out the kinks ...
you really scared us , you fool .
it's a miracle you're alive , but the doctors here are good .
good morning , doctor .
morning .
thanks on behalf of my brother .
i don't have a brother .
i said , my brother .
you operated on him yesterday .
how can i ever repay you?
that's quite all right .
medicine fascinates me .
it's just a job like any other .
what do you do?
i'm a magician .
really?
i can show you a trick .
this is not the right place .
it il only take a second .
what's in your pocket?
here .
watch closely .
stop moving your hands around .
goodness , i've got to run .
doctor?
this is for you .
that's my card .
come see my magic show .
thank you .
hey !
hi !
what a coincidence .
it certainly is .
what're you doing here?
i was at the library .
how are you?
i heard you and your boyfriend broke up .
where'd you hear that?
on the radio .
we might get back together .
it was wise you lied to me .
you thought i'd go bananas again
like when i used to put on disguises and follow you around .
i was thinking more of the time you almost set us on fire .
on fire?
what do you mean?
you heard me !
oh , that .
that was just a joke .
that was no joke !
don't you remember?
do you think i'd really set you on fire?
i'm not insane .
i think you are !
wait !
can i give you a hug?
no , you'd better not .
we must stop seeing each other .
i was thinking that myself .
even by chance .  you can say that again .
call me if you need help moving .
sorry , bad idea .
i take it back .
anything else you want?
no .
then i'm off .
bye ...
vesna isn't just a great girl who knows how to summon ufos .
more importantly , she's a master of the body shot .
show him !
that's not a good idea .
i agree .
i'm more interested in ufos .
body shots are better .
you're a dj , and you don't know what a body shot is?
i don't have to know everything .
lie down .
put salt behind your ear , tequila in your belly button .
put lemon in your mouth , and then vesna will drink it .
quit looking at each other !
i thought you were curious .
i am , but hanka's on her way .
this is not a good idea .
okay , you're right .
hanka !
wait !
sorry .
we were just drinking tequila like they do in mexico .
in mexico , huh?
they drink it like that there .
it comes from cactuses .
why did you ask me here?
it occurred to me that the guy you took to the hospital ...
... could've been a sign .
what kind of sign?
i don't know .
but it's odd you found him the night you moved out .
that is odd .
maybe it was a sign that we should've stayed together .
or that we shouldn't have .
or that we shouldn't have .
a tequila sunrise and a body shot of tequila .
do you know what a body shot is?
it'd make me happy .
honest .
i collect this stuff .
you collect guitar picks?
i collect all sorts of stuff .
will you go with me?
he il be more likely to give you the pick if you're alone .
anyway , he kept looking at you .
i il wait here for you , okay?
so , a guitar pick , right?
and i want it autographed .
fine .
hi .
on a guitar pick .
what time do you get off work?
everyone's covered with lights .
lights?
me , too?
well ...
to be honest , not really .
that's good .
isn't it?
it means that no one loves you .
your cell phone's ringing .
why don't you answer it?
but i don't have a cell phone .
hello?
you bet .
i wanted to go , but it slipped my mind .
a guitar pick .
sure i il bring one .
see you .
if i understand correctly , vesna promised her boyfriend a pick .
that's why who's here?
that's why i'm here .
because what do i know how to do?
forge a famous guitarist's autograph .
is that correct?
yup .
did i do a good job?
it looks great .
thanks .
my pleasure .
what do i owe you?
the guys said you're interested in ufos .
yup .
do you think they land here?
no , but they fly close to here .
do they?
if you hear about anything , i'd love to go with you .
i'm not sure .
why not?
people go to africa to watch dolphins from boats .
they go to asia to watch rhinos on elephant back .
why couldn't people watch ufos from a delivery truck here?
a travel agency , get it?
see old town in the morning ,
prague castle in the afternoon , and ufos at night .
want me to wait for you?
no , you don't have to .
thanks for offering .
hi !
hi !
can i come in?
sure .
i wanted to introduce you two , anyway .
monika !
bartender monika , meet bartender vesna .
is she your sister?
no .
does she look like my sister?
you're disgusting .
no , i'm not .
i like you , but everyone does this .
this is what you do .
this is just life .
your life .
we all fuck each other here .
there's nothing sad about it .
vesna !
i have to get this on film .
relax ...
you're an idiot !
hang on ...
czechs are nasty to each other because czech language is nasty .
czech is stupid .
the sounds are harsh , and it's complicated .
it's all perhaps ,  if ...
could and would .
no one knows how to say what they like to say .
would like to say .
would like to say .
and everyone tells lies .
they don't smoke enough pot .
do you think that's why?
if they did , they'd lie less .
maybe they'd break up less .
getting high isn't part of our culture yet .
maybe you're right .
i just know this country is fucked up .
that's for sure .
then again , every country is .
you can leave your shoes on .
really?
hello !
did hanka send you?
no , this was my idea .
did you hear what petr did?
no .
he sent her packing .
did he?
pretty cruel of him .
i'd say so .
may i videotape your house?
of course .
i'm sorry .
that's all right .
i il just turn this on ...
is this for television?
no .
i'm from a travel agency .
we specialize in japan .
japanese tourists want to see how typical czechs live .
would they come to our house?
yes , with an interpreter .
if you're interested we can go upstairs .
follow me .
do you talk?
who?
the two of us?
do you talk during meals?
yes , a little .
we talk a lot .
we've had some quiet applicants .
that's not what we want .
actually we talk all the time .
right , dad?
do you have a dog?
no .
no problem .
we il provide one .
get small dog that doesn't shed much .
hanka's staying in this bedroom now .
and here's the bathroom .
excellent .
you could walk the dog , watch some tv .
we could do that .
but the focus will be on food .
what do you mean?
i'd say we're going to eat .
exactly .
the japanese want to know how typical czechs act during meals .
come in .
am i disturbing you?
not at all .
come in .
at the hospital you offered to pay me back .
and the offer still stands .
now there is something i need .
what is it?
no , i'm sorry .
how would i do that?
no , that wouldn't work .
for my next trick i need a volunteer from the audience .
sir , why don't you come up here?
don't worry .
come right up .
get inside .
don't worry .
you il be fine .
you il be fine ...
perhaps .
this is ...
i il shut the door .
am i to believe he disappeared?
it sounds silly , doesn't it?
it sure does .
but it's true .
this is a very bad joke .
ondrej has never pulled silly stunts like this .
i am not leaving until you give me my husband back .
good afternoon .
may i help you?
are you mrs. cerna?
yes .
i've come to inspect your gas appliances .
come in .
the gate's open .
thank you , ma'am .
stop making those awful faces !
are they even going to watch me shave?
we can still cancel out .
when you think about it , we could prevent wars .
in kosovo , say?
doubtful .
but if the americans had visited vietnamese families ,
there wouldn't have been a war .
wars break my heart .
i can't bear to see those children and poor people .
and meanwhile we are so happy .
i'm not all that happy .
yes , you are .
happy is what those people will never be .
is everything all right?
yes .
i didn't even offer you a drink .
do i owe you anything?
no , these inspections are free .
fine .
goodbye .
goodbye .
did we have company?
no .
how do you explain the flowers in my room?
which flowers?
i don't believe it .
actually , the gas man was here .
what did he want?
he came to inspect the stove .
but we don't have a gas stove .
hello?
ondrej?
not having a gas stove is no reason to get hysterical .
record your mother .
back to our contest .
a friend of mine likes surprising me .
sometimes it's quite unpleasant , but now i il surprise him .
recently he gave me a tape of his mother .
so , robert .
a big hello to you and your mom !
i've improved .
for example , i go by garbage cans without taking anything .
i had a mess tin here .
really?
last time someone threw away a high power vacuum cleaner .
are you recording this?
yup .
that's good .
do you have anything to drink?
otherwise i wouldn't try ...
i left a high power vacuum cleaner there .
i see .
i didn't even look at it .
how do you know it was a high power vacuum?
there was a grinder here .
where's the wine?
did you see the grinder?
nope .
it was in a box and there were some new boots on top of it .
brand new .
that's how i knew the vacuum was good .
and i didn't look at it or the boots .
because i knew god was just tempting me .
move over .
why do you collect this junk?
my son is a disappointment and i want to be remembered for something .
you're such a klutz .
would you go with them?
i il shoot the breeze with them .
but i'm not going anywhere .
it's awesome here .
think so?
you bet .
there are forty two civilizations in the universe , and we're in last place .
measured by what?
moral maturity ...
yeah .
we're also the only planet where procreation requires only two beings .
so on the other planets you need three beings?
no , seven .
of various sexes .
there are three of us .
so we'd need four more beings of totally different sexes .
right .
then maybe i will go .
why are we here , anyway?
i guess we're waiting for ufos .
right .
i forgot something in the car .
why are we here , anyway?
you don't really believe in ufos .
maybe not .
then why are you in prague?
i came here to see dad .
dad?
your dad?
yup .
is he in this country?
yup .
does he know about you?
nope .
want to tell me about it?
nope .
and i don't want to start anything until i see him .
even though i like you .
understand?
of course .
at times it's easier to see a ufo than your own dad .
so the macedonian beauty came here to look for her dad .
he's from the czech republic , and she's never seen him before .
so now i'm going to play some macedonian music .
because at times it's easier to see a ufo than to live with the kind of girl i lived with for three years .
why did you live with me if it was that horrible?
sorry , we were stoned .
you can't always make excuses .
i'm not .
know what your problem is?
you've never done anything for anyone .
you've never given up anything you like for anyone .
would you get a degree for someone?
for you?
this isn't about me .
then who is this about?
would you give up anything at all?
of course .
something really important?
do you want me to jump off a bridge for you?
no , i just wanted you to be brave about our break up .
so i'd have a reason to respect you so i could come back to you .
so you wanted to come back to me because i broke up with you?
yeah .
that's great .
you're just like your mother .
what?
as station manager i am responsible for what you play .
i don't care about your break up or your contest .
no one does .
tell me why you play this stuff .
my mother is ten times worse than what you've been playing .
radio is no private matter .
if i hear this stuff again , you can pack it in .
get it?
yes .
i was afraid we'd never meet again .
nah , i knew we would .
how did you know that?
because the guy pinned in the car was a sign .
a sign?
we find a guy pinned in his car the first time we meet .
he was pinned in a car he'd rolled .
didn't that seem like a sign to you?
yeah , i guess so .
it's a clear sign that something's going on between us .
the fact that you're high is a sign you shouldn't be driving .
get a load of these buildings .
aren't they awesome?
what city is this?
dubrovnik?
this is prague , you moron .
i know .
i was just testing you .
this is where i was born .
this is where i live .
but today it seems new .
it's really nice .
tourists flip out over these buildings .
you can rip me off just like you do to tourists .
it sounds like you're saying he steals .
so you really steal , huh?
knock it off .
why?
let him steal .
it's awesome .
where's he going?
how can he drive from out there?
ouch !
the golden age of moving is coming .
more and more people are moving to more and more new places .
i'm afraid of how it il turn out .
but i'm not getting in the way .
i want to move with the times !
what do you want to be?
a mover .
you already are one .
awesome .
then i il keep my job !
my sincere condolences ...
wow !
awesome hose .
my condolences .
do i know you?
i'm ondrej .
of course , lenka's husband .
she's looking for you .
come in .
look at all the junk mom had .
it's that psychopath again .
he keeps following me around .
then we il get him stoned .
he doesn't smoke .
does he eat?
why wouldn't he?
then i il put it in some food .
this is my sister julie .
this is ondrej .
he's a doctor .
i don't have to introduce you .
this is jakub , a great musician .
hi , i'm jakub .
do you want something to drink?
tea?
coffee?
no , thanks .
do you have any pastry or cake?
isn't cake more for weddings?
do you have any mixes?
we must .
i want to bake something .
ondrej , i don't know how to get through to you .
look .
you've made a mess of your life , haven't you?
i'm offering you a way out .
what way?
what can you offer me?
you're a psychopath !
don't touch me !
you're an addicted psychopath !
life with a psychopath might be your only way out .
or are you looking for someone who il leave you in a year?
let's live together !
please !
i love you more than anything .
i know i act like an idiot .
that's because of you .
i think of you when i'm walking down the street , at work ...
for lenka .
i can't help it .
i think of you in so many places that i can't even name them all .
i went to medical school so you would be proud of me .
i sometimes wish you'd fracture your thigh in a car accident ...
don't touch me !
please !
don't touch me !
hanka , i'm begging you !
that's heavy stuff .
i understand you .
i'm a wreck , too .
can i give you a hug?
me?
just as friends .
what are you staring at?
it wasn't that big a deal .
i always stare like this .
don't look at me .
he asked .
i wanted to answer him .
but you were looking at me .
so i was looking at you instead of at him .
whatever .
what did you bake?
some excellent pastry .
i don't want any pastry .
i just want to sit down .
some party .
i'd like something to drink .
we have some excellent pastry .
what is this?
nothing .
did you set us on fire?
no , i didn't .
but we're burning !
no , you aren't .
everything's just fine .
have a seat .
it's all right .
holy shit !
this is warped !
holy shit !
this is unreal !
that was warped .
wasn't it?
please ...
i love you .
i think of you in so many places that i can't even name them all .
i love you more than anything .
why did you film this?
i don't know .
i found it interesting .
interesting?
yup .
it seems sad to me .
it is sad .
maybe that's my problem .
i find sad things fascinating .
without sadness i feel nothing , and i can't change .
that's quite sad , isn't it?
yes , but it's also fascinating .
you are a real idiot .
i'm sorry , hanka
scram !
we all need relationships .
someone who loves you .
someone who il caress you when you're down .
the world might be awesome , but sometimes it stinks .
and hanka's sensitive .
she's totally awesome .
i told her i love her and i want to live with her .
live with her?
you already have a girlfriend .
say what?
c'mon , alice .
alice who?
you tell me .
i wouldn't ...
oh yeah , alice .
but we broke up .
no , you didn't .
but we saw her off at the train station .
she just went to germany to see her aunt .
you're a total waste case .
you can't even remember who you're going out with .
do you even know your own name?
listen , quit smoking pot .
do you want me to go schizo?
i il wait for you
i have to tell you something .
i thought we'd start going out , but the guys said i already had a girlfriend .
which guys?
from the band .
then it all came back to me .
i'd totally forgotten about her .
you're joking , right?
no , i'm not .
i know it's awful .
i'm sorry , but put yourself in my place .
life's a bitch .
everything has turned against us .
i want to cry .
i love you , but i promised to stay with her .
i remember making that decision .
i don't want to hurt anyone .
you don't want to hurt anyone?
i'm sorry .
it's all that pot you smoke !
it's that lifestyle of yours !
this is the last thing i'm gonna play for you .
this is also the last tape i have of my girlfriend .
this is her cough from march 3 , 1997 .
you can see how long we were together .
i guess we hurt each other .
but in any event ...
here's a beautiful cough .
where have you been?
we started without you .
where have you been?
we started without you .
come on .
sit down .
what is this?
beef .
with cranberries .
no , thanks .
i'm not hungry .
this is beef .
have some more dumplings .
they want to see how we eat .
isn't this in the contract?
can i talk to you in private?
later , okay?
the father is indicating that they can talk later .
what the hell is this?
what's she saying?
watch your language !
stop snapping at me !
the daughter is surprised by the unusual situation .
i'm not afraid to slap you !
i came to see you because i feel awful and i need to talk to you .
yet what do i find here?
do you know why you feel awful?
it's that lifestyle of yours .
the daughter wants advice on how
to deal with the fact that a married man is stalking her .
it those friends of yours .
you don't even know them .
seeing them is enough .
isn't it odd for a girl your age to move all the time?
quiet !
seeing you breaks my heart .
you break my heart too , mom .
stop it !
this is unbearable .
the parents object to having this kind of discussion today .
kindly realize that life isn't that easy .
i see .
what?
you have an obligation .
we've had to make sacrifices .
well i have , out of love !
you don't even know what that means because your friends ...
... never make sacrifices for you .
i don't want them to !
and they don't !
you people don't live life .
you just slice it !
the mother thinks the daughter is to blame for her own problems .
i like women as people .
i'm just not going to sleep with them anymore .
if i ever do meet a girl , for the first 146 days we're just going to talk .
146 days .
that's important .
it can't be less than that .
then maybe i il give her a kiss .
but until i find that kind of girl i'm going to be alone .
not everyone has the chance to be alone like i have .
good morning .
good morning .
have you already started?
did you wash your hands?
yes .
i saw the video .
which video?
from robert's party .
i was quite shocked .
it was just an ordinary party .
you have a few drinks , and then act crazy .
you dance and laugh .
should i pack my things?
of course not .
have a seat .
i think we have a good relationship .
do you?
of course .
you buy us nice christmas gifts .
you don't smoke or drink .
you're faithful to me , reliable .
and you love us .
do you think so?
of course you love us .
did you think you loved her?
yes , i did .
sometimes it's hard to figure out what you want on your own .
you think you want to live with someone else .
yet what you really want is to dress up as a plumber .
why , that's me .
i didn't know the problem was your attraction to overalls .
you can wear them at home .
thanks , but i don't think that's the main problem .
perhaps the hospital would even let you wear them to work .
no .
well , maybe .
but promise you il think about it .
fine , i il think about it .
bon appetit .
bon appetit .
bon appetit !
i get high because the world is cruel and people are lonely .
i work so i can buy drugs that make people seem kind , friendly , free , and beautiful .
trouble is these drugs probably caused me to hurt someone .
so it doesn't make sense for me to do them anymore .
i've had it with drugs .
i'm giving up weed .
this is my last joint .
i'm not even going to finish it .
what's she like?
she's a bit selfish and tough , and she never gives up without a fight .
is it even worth the effort?
yeah .
give it a try .
hi !
hi !
pretty good , huh?
it occurred to me that the guy i took to the hospital ...
... really could've been a sign .
what kind of sign?
