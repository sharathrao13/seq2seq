all my life ,
i seemed to be in the wrong place at the wrong time .
my grandpa , stanley yelnats ll , says it's all because of this 1 50 year old curse .
now , i don't really believe in the family curse , but when things go wrong , it kind of helps if you can blame it on something .
and for me , things went wrong a lot .
oh , jeez !
oh !
grandpa says our destiny is sealed .
could a pair of shoes falling from the sky really be part of my destiny?
come here , boy !
hold it right there !
did you steal those shoes?
officer , i didn't do anything .
what's your name , boy?
i'm stanley .
stanley yelnats lv .

i'm glad you're here .
this whole floor smells like stinky feet .
what did you do to my stanley?
don't freak out .
it's a bruise .

don't say nothing until we talk to our lawyer !
you're gonna be sorry you ever messed with stanley yelnats !

could i just smell your shoe?
how about if you take your shoe off , and i'll just
check the bedroom .

this warrant isn't warranted !
this will never hold up in court !
uh huh .

how do you know that's not mine?
which bed is yours?
you don't have to answer that .
we have the right to remain silent .

i sleep here .
it's all because of your no good , dirty rotten , pig stealing great great grandfather .
there is no curse on this family .
there is on the men in this family .  " lf only , if only , "
the woodpecker sighs   please don't sing that song .  " the bark on the tree was as soft as the skies "
please don't sing that song , not at my table !
ma , relax .
i don't believe in the curse , anyways .
we're gonna need a damn good lawyer .
we can't afford a lawyer , pa .
we don't need a lawyer .
stanley will tell the truth .

today's menu chili , string beans , refried beans , garbanzo beans , green beans , and banana jello .
hey , stanley , come here , boy .
this is where you sit .
sit down .
hey , yo , new kid .
hey , yo .
see , you didn't dig today .
so , uh , you wouldn't mind giving up your bread to somebody who did , now , would you?
no , you can have it .
so , what'd they get you for?
stealing a pair of shoes .
from the store , or were they still on someone's feet?
no , no , he just killed the dude first .
you just left out that little detail , right?
they were clyde livingston's shoes .
sweetfeet?
what?
man , you did not steal no clyde livingston's sweetfeet shoes .
his world series cleats .
hold on , hold on .
how did you get 'em?
he's , like , the fastest guy in the majors , right?
only guy to hit four triples in one game .
clyde livingston donated his shoes to this . . . homeless shelter .
did they have red x's on 'em?
what'd he just say?
huh?
you got zero to talk .
hey , yo , what else can you do , zero?
yeah .
yeah , they did .
tell us a little something of your background . . .
mr. livingston .
besides the fact that it was your donated shoes that were stolen , what other connection might you have with this case?
well , i was an orphan .
i grew up in that home .
i don't understand what type of person steals from homeless children .
you're no fan of mine .
it was all because of your no good , dirty rotten , pig stealing great great grandfather .
that's who sealed our destiny .
why do you think none of his inventions work?
pa .
i learn from failure .
doesn't matter how smart you are .
you need luck something we ain't got .
yeah , what about your father , the first stanley yelnats?
he wasn't so unlucky .
you told me he made a fortune in the stock market .
some luck .
yeah , he lost everything .
he was robbed by kissin 'kate barlow .
get on up outta there !
gimme your loot !
are you kidding me?
she kiss him?
oh , no .
she only kissed the men she killed .
what you got down there , huh?
pass it up !
come on !
she left him stranded in the desert .
come on , boys !
let's ride !
no water , no food for 1 6 days .
lf she'd have kissed him , she'd have killed him .
you'd have never been born .
smiling faces !
smiling faces !
the early mole digs the deepest hole .
shovels on the left , tortillas on the right .
let's go !
okay , come and get it .
let's go !
come on , magnet !
open them peepers !
let's go !
let's go !
head's still on the pillow !
this ain't no dreamland .
it's reality .
let's go , hotshots !
step up and get your . . .
hey , man , you picked up x ray's shovel .
it's shorter than the rest of them .
smaller shovel , smaller hole .
this isn't a girl scout camp .  let's go down
nobody's gonna babysit you .  let's go down
dig here .  oh , sinners , let's go down
now , if you find anything interesting ,
you are to report it to me or pendanski .
lf the warden likes what you find , you get the rest of the day off .
what am i supposed to be looking for , mr. sir?
you're not looking for anything .
you're building character .
you take a bad boy , make him dig holes all day , and it turns him into a good boy .
that's our philosophy here at camp green lake .
start digging .  show me the way   good lord , show me the way
one down , 1 0 million to go .  show me the way   good lord , show me the way
oh , sinners , let's go down   let's go down   let's go down
excuse me , can you throw that in another pile or something ,
'cause it keeps getting in my hole .
shut up !
watch where you're moving your dirt !
watch where you're throwing your dirt , stanley .
it was all because of your no good , dirty rotten , pig stealing great great grandfather ,
elya yelnats .
it started in a little village in latvia .
he was shoveling in morris menke's barn , when myra , his beautiful daughter , walked by .
and that was it .
so what does your great great grandfather do?
he goes to a fortune teller , madame zeroni , for advice .
all you think about is myra menke .
i know .
that's when our troubles began .
listen to madame zeroni .
you should go to america .
that's where my son is .
that's your future , not myra menke .
her head's as empty as a flowerpot .
mr. menke . . .
i would like your permission to marry your daughter .
you too?
lgor barkov has offered his fattest pig for her .
what do you got?
a heart full of love .
he's just a boy !
i'd rather have a fat pig .
morris menke is a schmuck .
okay , here's what you do .
take the little one .
but this solves nothing .
so it will grow .
every day , you carry the pig up the mountain .
make it drink the water from the stream while you sing . . .  " lf only , if only , " the woodpecker sighs
woodpecker sighs .  " the bark on the tree was as soft as the skies "   while the wolf waits below , hungry and lonely   he cries to the moon , " lf only , if only "
every day , the pig will get fatter , and you will get stronger .
now , after you give the pig to menke , you must carry madame zeroni up the mountain and sing while i drink so i can get strong , too .
but if you forget to come back for madame zeroni , you and your family will be cursed for always and eternity .
get your water , dog .
oh , my god .
here comes the water truck .
first hole's the hardest .
let's go !
hey , mr. sir .
what you doin ', man?
get your place in line , magnet !
keep your hands off of me , man !
so , how'd it go your first day , yelnats?
got some blisters on you?
big , fat blisters .
yeah .
well , don't worry .
everything turns to callus eventually .
that's life .
next .
myra , who do you choose
lgor barkov or elya yelnats?
you want me to decide?
that's right , my blossom .
gee , i don't know .
which pig weighs more?
they are the same .
oh , i know !
i will think of a number between 1 and 1 0 .
okay , i'm ready .
marry lgor .
you can keep my pig as wedding present .
two pigs for one daughter !
you done already?
don't you know , man?
he's , like , the fastest digger in the camp .
he's a mole .
i think he eats the dirt .
he's a weird dude .
moles don't eat dirt .
worms eat dirt , dog .
so that was it .
he took madame zeroni's advice and went to america , like her son , but the dummy forgot to go back and carry madame zeroni up the mountain .
madame zeronl : lf you forget to come back for madame zeroni , you and your family will be cursed for always and eternity .
somebody help me !
anybody up there? !
i'm done with my hole now !
oh , god .
oh , god .
don't move .
oh , f
aah !
get your stuff .
get yourself a good sleep , son .
yes , sir .
yeah .
oh , my god !
what color was its blood?
i don't know .
i couldn't tell .
i wish i'd have seen it .
bam !
lf mr. sir didn't shoot it . . .
stanley , you'd be in a hole .
did you know that each one's got exactly 1 1 spots?
yeah , man , but if you ever get close enough to count 'em . . .
look , it's the lizards we're working for , man .
we build their houses for 'em .
i mean , yesterday , i saw like 1 0 of them in one hole .
man , we ain't diggin 'for no lizards .
what we diggin 'for?
like mr. sir said , we're diggin 'to build some character .
come on !
wake up , buddy !  feelin 'mighty fine
dear mom . . .  feelin 'mighty fine
i'm having a wonderful time at camp .
the food's great .
not as good as yours , of course , but i like it . "  feelin 'mighty fine at this time
we've been out on the lake all day .
where's a person go to the bathroom around here?
man , pick a hole .
any hole .  feelin 'mighty fine
once i pass the swimming test ,
i'll get to learn how to water ski .
i've made lots of friends .
oh , you're goin 'to hell for sure .
feelin 'mighty fine
and the water is cool and refreshing .
at his time
you'd like my counselor .
he's a doctor .

and i'm really enjoying the wildlife . "  don't believe a word they say about me   because i'm feelin 'mighty fine   feelin 'mighty fine

well , that's interesting .

sam , thank you .
the ancient egyptians knew the secrets of the onions .
how its potent juices can cure stomachaches and toothaches , measles and mumps , rheumatism , hemorrhoids .
lf you don't believe me , just ask mary lou .
all she eats is onions , and she's almost 1 00 years old .
how would you know , sam?
you're not a day over 25 .
nature's magic vegetable , miss katherine .

you boys get one life , and so far , you've done a pretty good job of screwing it up .
so , you're caveman now big shot .

well , let me tell you something , caveman , you are here on account of one person .
you know who that person is?
yeah .
my no good , dirty rotten , pig stealing great great grandfather .
that's who it is .
no .
you screwed your life up , stanley yelnats , and it's up to you to fix it .
it's not gonna be easy , but you'd be surprised what you can accomplish once you set your mind to it .
even zero here isn't completely worthless .
what about you , zero?
what do you like to do?
you just won't talk with me , will you?
man , he only talks to caveman , yo .
you think you're better than all this?
i like diggin 'holes .

my dearest stanley ,
your letters make me feel like one of the other moms who can afford to send their kids to summer camp .
do not touch my shoes !
your father thinks he's real close to a breakthrough .
i do hope so , stanley , because the landlord is threatenin 'to evict us because of the odor .
sir , you are an insult to the chemistry of smell !
eight months !
i am going to boil it with cross trainers !
aah !
aah !
i feel so sorry for the old lady who lived in the shoe ,
'cause it must have smelled real bad .
she's crazy .
what are you laughing at?
just something my mom wrote .
she said . . .
i feel sorry for the little old lady who lived in the shoe ,
'cause it must have smelled really bad .
you know , like the nursery rhyme .
i feel really awkward with you reading over my shoulder like that , so . . .
i can't read .
can you teach me?
um . . .

maybe we'll get some clouds .
it will rain for 40 days and 40 nights .

i tell you what i'll fix that roof in exchange for three jars of your spiced peaches .
it's a deal .
well , miss katherine ,
i guarantee that roof for five years .
lf there's anything else . . .
the windows won't open .
and the children and i would enjoy a breeze now and then .
i can fix that .
and this maiden , she lived with no other thought
than to love and be loved by me .
she was a child , and i was a child
in this kingdom by the sea .
but we loved . . .

while mr. sir was filling our canteens . . .
i snuck into his truck and , uh , stole his sunflower seeds .
yeah .
that's it .
caveman , would you , uh , kindly bring me that little brass case in the bureau over there with my nail polish in it?
yeah , sure .
them little diddles think i don't have eyes in the back of my head .
but i don't miss much . . . as you well know .
you know , my philosophy is see , i keep 'em in line punishment and reward .
punishment . . . reward .
every time they see me coming , a little shiver goes up their spine .
d " tent snaky little bunch , you know .
they think they're a step ahead of me , but i'm miles ahead of them .
i come back at night .
i look around .
i see in their eyes .
they know i know .
come right over here , son .
here you go .
thank you .
see this , caveman?
this is my special nail polish .
i make it myself .
you want to know my secret ingredient?
rattlesnake venom .
i just love what it does to the coloring .
it's perfectly harmless .
when it's dry .
so you think he stole your sunflower seeds .
no , i don't .
i think he's covering for x ray or somebody .
it was a 5 pound sack , and he claims to have eaten it all .
but it was only half full when i got it .
and , uh , there's a lot in my hole .
you could check that .
i will .
i will check it .
aaah aah !
aah !
all i give you is respect and affection . . .
i suggest you go back to your hole now .
why'd you do that?
ooh !
i liked you better when you smoked .
hey , look who showed up .
hey , man , we thought you were dead for sure .
