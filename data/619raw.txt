now what do you gotta go and say that for?
well , now or later?
how could i misinterpret?
no , bernie .
you didn't send the wrong guy .
i'm handling things .
but i never signed up for that .
listen , i promise you , when i tell him it will make a difference .
bye .
hey , sweets .
i keep calling and , uh , i haven't heard a word from you .
i'm starting to wonder .
i know you're angry with me , but , uh , you know , " ain't no sunshine when she's gone .
okay?
i think she actually went to vegas .
i keep telling you, jerry , these women are problems, you know .
you should try to be like me .
i answer to myself .
no hassles , nobody ridin 'my ass like a goddamn horse in a saddle .
free .
ted, you keep your self closed off ... so you have no shot at meeting the right woman .
any woman can be the right woman if the numbers work and you're willing .
no way .
not me .
you settle . you open yourself up .
you become vulnerable .
what's this sudden insight into my relationship?
okay , look, jerry .
she is in vegas .
what?
hey , shit falls down, you know?
" shitfalls down .
margolese called nayman all pissed off ... that you were fucking this up , told him to put somebody on sam to keep an eye .
in case  " in case?
in case i get any funny ideas . and you're just telling me this now?
don't break my balls .
there's other things to consider .
like what?
like that gun is worth a lot of money .
people know you have it .
sam could be in danger .
no shit .
who did they put on her?
you don't know him , but it's safe to say you know of him .
who?
it's that fucking psycho leroy from minnesota .
leroy !
nayman had to do it, jerry .
it was an order .
margolese would know if he didn't .
wait .
they're just trying to scare me .
well, that would sure do it for me .
we've all heard the kidney story, jerry .
nayman wants us on that 7 : 00 flight to vegas , pistol in tow , no ifs , ands or buts .
they'll meet us a tthe airport , and then this leroy guy will take the pistol to margolese .
yeah .
i had to borrow do you mind?
sleep well?
yeah . and you?

somebody i don't like very much .
you can have that removed , you know?

at first , i thought this guy is all right .
and then i'm thinking he's more than all right , he's terrific .
but there's no way he's gonna feel the same way about me .
then i find out he does .
then i'm thinking ... what happens when he finds out what i do ... and who i am and what i've done?
so , who am i kidding , right?
let's get serious . what are you gonna do about it?
sighs that's the thing .
i didn't have to do anything .
it happened absent of my will to consciously make it happen .
oh , really?
i was a little drunk last night .
i took my gun and i put it up in the towels in the bathroom, you know .
and he found it .
and he said , " the past doesn'tmatter .
it's the future that counts .
leroy .
see , life can change .
people can change .
i haven't cried in 12 years .
what are you lookin 'at?
don't look at me like that .
you're makin 'it worse . what are you , barbara walters?
sniffles
it's just beautiful .
let's talk about somethin 'else .
what do you wanna talk about?
anything . anything else .
anything . whatever .
what was it over , the last time you cried?
let's talk about that .
oh, yeah, that'll bring the sun right out .
ted i heard it was this guy leroy's mother .
that's what i heard .
okay, that's what we call " bullshit .
if i told one guy at the next convention ... that you kept your mother cut up in the freezer for five years , you'd have a reputation too .
factor not , it makes no difference .
jesus, ted, you can't be so naive , man .
the guy's a star .
oh , mygod . what are you so worried about then if you think he's all blow hard and bullshit?
i met leroy once , in minnesota .
it was for all of two seconds .
i shook his hand .
he seemed like a nice enough guy .
whether or not he lives up to this pumped up legend of a psychotic is beside the point .
and if he does sit naked in his garage soaking in gasoline lighting matches , i don't care .
what concerns me is he was hired in the first place . are you with me?
geez, jerry, you really met him?
oh , my god !
hey , old ted is not gonna let anything happen , okay, jerry?
i'm here .
thanks , ted .
i feel perfectly safe .
hola .
i no fuck around .
comprende?
gun .
gun .
loaded .
bang , bang . you , dead . do you have a speech impediment?
give me the fuckin 'gun . the pistol .
the pistol?
you know what i'm talkin 'about .
let's go !
the pistol?
okay , all right .
what's your name?
joe .
joe .

geez ! jerry , have you lost your mind?
what were you talking about on the phone?
jerry, will you put the gun away?
was it to offme?
is that what you two were discussing, to offme?
jerry , i would never  go ahead , deny it .
go ahead .
go ahead !
okay , okay .
jerry, that's what he said .
so you were lying to me when you said that i would walk away from this .
no, jerry, that's what he said .
then you're lying now about him telling to off me .
which is it?
no , no .
nayman told me to do it, jerry , but
but? but?
but
but you're just doing your portion .
isn't that how it works, ted?
seventeen portions left for boca boca raton .
right?
i wouldn't do that portion .
come on , i swear !
on one hand, they tell you to bring me in .
on the other hand , they tell you to take me out .
why are you being told two contradicting things?
you don't ask a question?
i i just i i don't know .
you don't think that's a little weird?
yeah , it's it's weird .
right !
because something's going on .
what is it?
exactly . you don't know , 'cause you're just doing your fucking part .
well , i'm not going down because you don't know !
see my predicament?
you're my guy, ted .
you're my guy, jerry .

hmm . yeah .
you're right .
this is an offer for the gun .
yeah .
i can see how this looks .
i've just been trying to get some, you know , better numbers together .
you have no intention of giving the gun to margolese , do you , bernie?
look , bobby . you know , i know that you're loyal .
and that's good .
i mean , nobody's debating that .
let me ask you .
in your skulking around , going through private things in other people's offices , did you manage to discover that he's shutting us down?
that's right .
you , me , everybody .
i don't i don't understand .
you didn't get the memo , the severance package, the bonus?
no?
no .
nothing .
yeah , me neither .
difference between you and me is i know when i'm being fucked ... and you don't , 'cause you're standing on the wrong fucking line .
let me help you get on the right side of the line ... and do for you what he should've done , bobby .
he's changed in prison .
i'm telling you , something's changed him .
he's not the same guy .
they're still holding .
what do you want me to tell 'em?
can i count on your cooperation?
yeah, yeah , bobby .
i'm here . yeah .
yeah, that's his hotel .
yeah , all right .
sure .
what?
plan b is now in effect .
i hope you don't get airsick .

i'm done with mr. jerry welbach .
mr. " hi . " no , no .
leroy ask about the gun .
is ist hat leroy?
did he fucking touch you? do you have any idea ... what i have been through these last few days , hmm?
whatever you've been through , multiply it by a thousand times .
you'll have some vague conception of where i'm at .
oh , oh , oh !
isn't that typical, jerry?
it's all a competition !
shh , shh .
titfortat, tatfortit !
stop yelling, for christ's sake !
how are you? are you okay? are you all right?
where are you?
toluca airport, jerry .
and things are shitty really shitty !
tell him if he shows up with the pistol , everything will be all right .
he doesn't care about that .
only cares about himself .
it's the same thing with him .
why are you airing personal matters with complete strangers?
oh , let me see .
uh , i don't think that you really classify ... someone who you just perpetrated a killing with a complete fucking stranger !
and let me tell you something .
i can't find my kotex cards ...
or mycredit pads !
sam, what did you say?
all right, jerry, just settle down .
hey ! what'd you do to her?
jerry, just settle down .
okay?
yeah .
we had a slight situation , but it should occur to you ... that i'm a professional and i know what i'm doing .
so why don't we all just chill out a minute here?
woman speaking overp . a. ]
now first of all, what happened?
did you get lost?
yeah, five fucking years ago .
what did you i can't hear you .
no , nothing .
nothing .
nothing .
i hope you have something .
yeah, well you just you don't
just make sure you return her with all ten toes . you hear me?
i understand .
i understand .
huh?
justcome down here , pick us up .
we'll square things away .
you got a very special woman here, jerry .
but we all know how you can get , right?
chuckles
so , let's not have any of that .
what?
this is a time for selflessness .
what? wha  dial tone humming
you all right?
stupid gun .
out !
leroy i have to ask you a question .
and it's an important one , so ...
i want you to think about the answer before you give it to me , okay?
okay .
when two people love each other , really love each other , but they just can't get it together , when do you get to that point where enough is enough?
that oh, well, that's you know .
um, you know it's over when
okay , i have , like , these psychosomatic ... insomniatic manifestations of
uh well , here's the thing about me .
i'm a product of my emotions versus being a product ofmyenvironment , like him , which he is , exactly , just that environmental
i i need sunshine to grow .
that's who i am .
and with the projection of
i have goals .
that's your answer?
yeah .
that's not right .
i mean, there's a right answer here , but that's not it .
scoffs
look .
in my business , you're surrounded ... by loneliness and finality .
now , i don't care what your take is on an afterlife .
when people die , it's scary .
and they go alone .
now, the people that i send off ... that have experienced love , they're a little less scared .
i mean, they're still scared , but there's ... a calmness to 'em .
and i think that comes from the knowledge that somebody somewhere loved them ... and cared for'em and will miss 'em .
now , i see that from time to time , and i am awed by it .
i don't think i'd be telling you any of this if it wasn't for frank .
anyway , it's it's a loaded question .
look, when two people love each other ,
totally, truthfully , all the way love each other , mm hmm . the answer to that question is simple , especially in your case .
when do you get to that point where enough is enough?
never .
never .
i just hope jerry's not stupid .
what is he driving?
it's a funky rental .
look , i know we're all a little grouchy right now .
we'll get something to eat , you'll get the pistol and then we'll all go our separate ways .
really separate ways .
now , don't start , sam .
you know what .
shut up .
i'll start because i have the right .
why do you do that?
do not tell me to shut up .
i count here, jerry .
we had an agreement , remember?
shut up .
why don'twe all shut up a little bit?
i swear to god , i will crash this fucking car right now .
jerry , don't do that .
i will .
one more word out of you . another word , sam .
one more word .
i swear to fucking god .
nauga hyde .
all right .
all right, jerry . i
are you finished?
yes !
you gonna shut up?
yes, yes, yes .

so i go to the trunk , there's no spare .
four hours in the baking sun waiting for a truck to come by .

look at his head !
stop !

you made a terrible mistake !
baby , leroy is black .
leroy's black .
okay?
no .
yes !

yeah . do you have enough money?
yeah , i'm all right .
i wanna ask you a question .

if two people love each other , but they just can't seem to get it together ,
when do you get to that point of enough is enough?
never .
bleating
they'll call .
i've left 60 messages .
i said it was an emergency .
why would nayman ask you if you like sex and travel?
i mean, w w what is it even supposed to mean?
that you fool around or something?
is that is that
i tell you this whole , long debacle , and this you have a problem with?
yeah . yeah , i do , because i think tha twhen you ask someone ...
who is involved in a relationship of the heart ...
uh huh? yeah? if they like sex and travel , that that's that's m m mean spirited .
it's it's it's stupid .
and i'll tell you this .
we're not running anymore .
no , no , no , no , no .
so done with the running .
just the packing and the running and the
sooner or later , that phone is gonna ring .
we are going to get your passport in order ... and you are gonna put that gun in margolese's hand where it belongs .
nayman is fucking margolese .
that has got nothing to do with us .
by the grace of god or i don't know what , honey , you have managed to forrest gump your way through this .

door opens
whispering in spanish
mr. margolese .
well , i i i don't understand .
what's it gonna take , jerry?
what?
for the gun, jerry .
what's it gonna take for you to give it to me and not to another?
you don't man !
what'll it take?
you know , i i don't know what it takes .
i'm new in the " fuck you " business .
you tell me , mr. margolese .
what does it take?
i didn't fuck you, jerry .
i had nayman send you down here , but i didn't know he was looking for a buyer .
when i found out he was looking fora buyer , i didn't know who on my team was ... still on my team , or even if there was a goddamn team .
stammers who the fuck are these guys?
they work for this man , tropillo .
and who the fuck is tropi you know what? not even important .
you give me one good reason why i shouldn't fight to my death to not give you the gun .
believe you me , if it comes to that , someone here's gonna leave this room missing an ear ... or not being able to fuck anymore .
one reason , now that you let me know what you think i'm made of .
chuckling are you a fatalist, jerry?
uh , i never really thoughtabout it .
por favor .
gracias .
when you do think about it , about that afternoon that you smashed into my life , into my car , ever think there's anything to that?
i honestly never thought about it .
because of that afternoon , i'm doomed to remember ... a simple backwards inmate with a paperclipping .
when you're in jail , a small box , you learn a lot about the fella you're in a cage with .
i grew to love that boy , like he was my own son .
but he was his .
one day the boy came to me with a paperclipping .
this is my destiny .
this is my birthright .
it was a story about the pistol how they found it in the mines stashed away .
when i asked why it meant so much to him , the story he told changed my life .
spanish ]
tropillo's son's voice ]
the night before the nobleman's arrival , the assistant could not sleep , his heart in a chingpain .
shouting in spanish
the day was upon him when the gunsmith would present ... his gift to the nobleman and his son .
the nobleman's son was anotoriously vicious soldier , worldly and wicked .
for him , his father demanded something more beautiful , more perfect than he'd ever laid eyes on before .
but nothing , no words or description could have given just ice to it ... or have prepared him for that gun's flawless grace .
when thenobleman's son saw his intended bride to be , it was love at first sight .
the nobleman's son took the mighty weapon into his hands .
a perfect fit .
it did not work .
the nobleman took it as a bad omen .
the curse had rendered it useless in unworthy hands .
the gunsmith urged him to try it one last time , and so he did .
the nobleman was insulted by the ineptness , angry with the poor gunsmith .
the yargued .
when the nobleman's son realized that her heart belonged to the poor , simple assistant , a man far less than he , he was furious in anger .
he could not have that .
the assistant , realizing that even if the gun should work , she would certainly die next , begged his love to withdraw and accept their fate .
no audible dialogue
some say you could actually hear her heart break .
she fearlessly surrendered her bitter spirit unto purgatory .
church bells ringing ]
the pistol contains her damned soul .
margolese day afterday i would listen to that story .
and always he would tell me , " when i get out ,
i will find that pistol and i will return it to my father , whose father's father had crafted the gun .
eighteen months later , he took it in the belly for me .
he died .
i vowed to search , acquire the pistol and return it to his father .
my grandson beck , headstrong boy .
sure , he was mixed up .
he didn't understand the honor ... behind what i was doing .
that's when it became clear to me i had to send you down here .
because you were the instrument in the situation, jerry .
his son is dead .
my grandson is dead .
all of it brought together by that afternoon at our intersection .
well, that that's a ... pretty good fucking reason .
you are a soldier of god .
speaking spanish ]
she will be safe there , right there , and she can fly with the angels .
no devils can catch her here , righ there , and now she will be able tofly with the angels .
we square?
i'll owe you .

let her out !
you give me the pistol and i'll let her out .
all right . all right , nayman , where are the keys?
i might have lost them .
well, you're shit out of luck , because she's the only one who knows where the pistol is .
oh .
chuckles
sam , no !

the pistol was crafted fora noble man by a poor mexican gunsmith .
nobleman .
hmm?
it's nobleman , not noble man .
one word , not two .
what did i say?
that's what i what difference does it make?
it doesn't make a difference , honey .
