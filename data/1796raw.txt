sex and lucla
i'm sorry , lorenzo .
for everything i said when i left .
yeah , but you were right .
you live with a sick person .
no , that's not true .
i was too hard on you .
don't worry , luca .
that's it .
i'm in a hole .
i've tried to get out , but i can't .
i'm lost forever .
i'll take a few days off and we'll take a trip .
to your island .
you can show me .
how about it?
just the two of us .
it's calm this time of year .
we'll swim and lay in the sun .
i don't want to go to that lsland .
i don't understand you .
you always wanted to go back .
relax , honey .
don't worry .
look , wait up for me and tell me tonight .
i'll listen to anything you say .
is that why you're so screwed up?
something about the island?
i'm sorry , i can't tell you about it .
you don't deserve this .
you shouldn't know .
luca , we're slammed .
sorry , i have to hang up .
we're slammed , but later ...
yeah , slammed .
bye .
sorry , but i have to go .
lorenzo needs me .
if i were you , i'd take him , pulling his ear , to a shrink .
lorenzo .
lorenzo .
lorenzo?
lorenzo alvarez residence?
yes .
are you a family member? .
i'm his girlfriend , i live with him .
what is it?
this is the police department calling to inform you that ...
i've got some bad news .
don't wait up .
i may never be back .
you see , he ...
a car came along and ...
i don't know where to , but far away .
i leave you everything ... but me .
forgive me .
that's my last request .
i'll live alone .
with no one else .
i don't need people .
what'll it be?
alone .
alone in the sun .
no .
i'm not gonna swim .
i'll stay in the sun .
alone .
alone in the sun .
alone .
alone in the sun .
sex 6 years earller
the best fuck of my life .
i don't even know your name .
it's better that way .
less complicated .
give me a hint .
anything .
i'd like that .
like a souvenir .
where are you from?
madrid .
i'm from valencia .
another one .
two more hints each and we go our separate ways .
i'm a paella expert .
that's logical .
not quite .
keep in mind that you just fucked a world class cook .
you're right .
everything was delicious .
of course .
a little salty , though .
what about you?
sure , lots .
let's hear one .
i was born in madrid on this very day .
around this time .
it's your birthday !
yes .
my birthday boy from madrid .
what a great way to celebrate !
i'm your paella chef from valencia .
and your birthday gift .
hey , that's three things !
you gave me only two .
i'm going to look for the third .
i've been calling all morning .
it's not my fault he's so busy .
then who's fault is it?
it's his job's fault .
tell him to work less .
i'll call back later .
he still can't talk .
can i leave him a message?
of course .
i'll pass it on .
well , let's see .
i'm pregnant .
since i know it's not his , and i don't need him , tell him i'm going to find my child's father .
you're leaving?
that's right .
i'll give you two a little hint .
he's not from valencia .
fine , one more hint .
i'm leaving right now for ...
madrid .
they'll advance you 20 percent of what they gave you last time for your novel .
i couldn't ask for more .
no , it's fine .
thanks , pepe .
it'll get me through winter .
i'll have it ready by summer .
really?
you've been blocked two years .
i'm figuring out if i'm really a writer .
you?
a writer?
to the core .
you cant do other thing .
what about that other story?
the one about the island .
and the valencian girl?
maybe .
i'm going to buy smokes .
put lots of sex in it .
people always like it .
yeah , very .
can i talk to you?
now?
later , then .
i'm with a friend .
what about?
well ...
is something wrong?
yes .
tell me .
now?
yes .
what's your name?
luca .
i'm lorenzo .
i know .
i know you .
i read your novel .
many times , and ...
i can't read anything else .
it grabbed me inside and won't let go .
but ...
i've also followed you .
when i see you
i like to follow behind and see where you go , in secret .
i know where you live .
it's nearby .
and sometimes
i see you here .
do you recognize me?
no .
i'm a waitress in that restaurant .
you've never come in .
my boss is fine .
he's a good cook .
but he wants to live together , and the truth is ,
i was really glad .
because ...
i felt needed .
and i even like him .
so ...
i've decided ...
what?
the person i really want to live with is you .
it's not that you're lonely .
i'm completely in love with you .
madly , as you can see .
you're so brave .
yeah .
and it's over .
i tried .
did you enjoy that?
feel free to leave .
is there anything else you want?
yes .
with time , living together , you'll end up falling in love with me , of course .
i think i just did .
let's go get drunk and celebrate .
behind this door you will find my altar .
what pretty lights you have at home .
i'm so happy .
you can't imagine .
go ahead and undress me .
forgive me , lorenzo .
i'm not used to things working out .
do whatever you want to me .
you start , okay?
a ray of sunshine ...
brought your love to me ...
slowly .
with love .
we're just starting .
like that .
so it lasts longer .
i'm dying , i'm dying !
my love !
i'm gonna die !
it's delicious , lorenzo .
wait until you try the fish .
i've always been around good cooks .
i don't know why .
though my boss isn't around much anymore .
my grandmother , yes .
with her home cooking ... just for me .
i moved in with her when i was six .
she said my parents and brother had opened a newsstand in heaven in front of the angel school .
a newsstand and a bookshop .
because their stand in the village never paid much .
the three of them were killed in a car crash .
and my poor grandmother died two years ago ...
she told me the whole story in a so good way ... ... that i still believe it .
i always liked people who tell stories in their way .
i trust them .
did your mother teach you to cook?
no .
she left my dad real quick , when i was young .
i had to cook for him .
until one day he got stabbed .
i may be a shitty cook , but i'm a great waitress .
i have a camera .
how about a striptease?
right now , without getting up .
if you do one later .
you wouldn't .
i've got just what you want .
oh , how i knew ...
i've got just what you want .
oh , how i knew ...
i've got just what you want .
it's all been taken care of ,
i'll settle the score , remember ...
i've got a map ...
gorgeous . ... and i'm one nosy bitch .
i'm working on it .
i gotta do it , i don't want to end up broke .
my feet are my ticket ...
had to be good at something ...
i'm working on it .
i'm working on it .
i'm working on it .
i'm resourceful , baby !
you turn me on , saliva , milk and stuff ...
i'm in control .
lorenzo ...
lorenzo , my love .
i can't take anymore .
so much love will kill me .
i'm dying !
i'm dying !
don't scream , it's no big deal !
push .
that's it , a little more .
here it comes .
a little more .
here it comes .
i'll get the dad .
yes , please .
you see?
shouting makes no difference .
there's no one there .
it's all right , my little girl will help me find him .
have you ever ... with another girl ... had better sex?
no .
tell me the truth .
maybe on an isolated occasion .
but it's different .
isolated on the island , right?
yes .
a random somebody , a total stranger , with a full moon ...
we should go to your island .
separately , and meet there ,
iike strangers .
we'd have the best sex ever .
which do you prefer?
wild sex with a stranger?
or sex with someone you know , someone you love , but also wild?
what?
you have to choose .
wild sex with a stranger , or wild sex with someone who's crazy about you , and who you love .
go ahead .
be frank .
with you .
finally .
i'd never imagined being so lucky .
girls like you never like guys like me .
you're a gift .
the restaurant in madrid grew famous thanks to the paellas made by the silent girl .
she still recalled her grandmother , buried back home with her parents .
when asked where she was from , she was so timid that she'd say she was from malta .
her destiny changed that night , when she ran into a real maltese .
a ray of sunshine ...
brought your love to me ...
a ray of sunshine ...
straight to my heart ...
how's it going?
fine .
getting used to all this clean air .
yeah .
you get used to everything here .
this island's easy .
and you're a pro .
of course .
you have oxygen .
i'm renting scuba equipment this summer .
i'm testing it .
you like diving?
no , not me .
just the opposite .
sorry , but ...
i prefer open air .
open air and sunshine .
too bad .
these waters are special .
to each his own .
this really isn't an island .
it isn't?
it's a giant lid .
a floating piece of earth .
like a raft .
but it isn't moving .
people get dizzy here during high tide .
and no one knows why .
except you .
i've dived underneath the whole island .
it's totally hollow .
thousands of caves , but nothing else .
not a single rock connects it to the seafloor .
what's your name?
carlos .
i'm luca .
trust me , luca .
i'll show you someday .
okay .
but i'll stay up here .
right .
the girl waits on the pretty side , and the crab explores the ugly , ... ... rocky , ... ... horrible side .
do you want to see the good things ... ... on this island?
yeah .
i want you to meet elena .
hi , i'm elena .
luca .
stay for dinner?
okay .
you can sleep here , too .
it's a guest house .
carlos is alone , so i have 9 rooms free .
want to see them?
come on .
this is my room .
next to the kitchen so i can cook on line .
come on in .
no , i'm sorry .
i'm not ready to see other people up close .
i know which room .
it's perfect for you .
come on .
i leave the second floor vacant until summer .
3, 000 a day in low season , but you can have it for 2, 000 .
plus 2, 000 if you want board .
i recommend it , i'm the best cook around .
can i skip dinner and stay tonight?
we'll talk tomorrow .
of course .
something terrible happened and i had to run .
we'll take care of you here .
a ray of sunshine ...
straight to my heart ...
brought your love to me ...
i'd searched for so long ...
and finally it's mine ...
i have a new guest .
she's a fantastic singer .
so from now on , i'll cook even better .
if possible .
can i name you?
name?
yeah , luca .
are you writing it?
it's still unsent .
you can change your name if you want .
we all use nicknames .
her name's lucla .
a ray of sunshlne .
is that okay?
it's great .
look .
this is for you .
sing us something , luca " .
a ray of sunshlne ...
stralght to my heart ...
welcome , luca .
nice song .
where are you? " .
everyday further away from where i was .
i like that .
so would carlos .
for himself .
he's been here 6 months .
i sense he's still tied to the main land .
he's someone who gains your trust easily .
is there anything between you?
yeah , sex .
every now and then .
without intimacy .
i prefer it , this way i don't get hooked .
just wild sex .
it must be the island .
yeah , but ...
carlos has the biggest dick i've ever seen .
how lucky .
i don't know where he got it .
it's enormous .
where are you?
the abortion part .
is that a hint?
why don't you take a stroll?
i am .
in the street .
you're like an expectant father .
exactly .
and you're the mother .
ay my love , without you i dont understand the meaning of to wake up ,
ay my love , without you my bed is wider ,
ay my love who show me the truth ,
there are loneliness and a bunch of frost between us .
it's very positive .
there's lots of happiness .
it's me .
i was expecting something tragic .
like in your first novel .
i should have read it while you were writing , to get used to the idea .
i screwed up .
i'm sorry .
i'm going for a walk .
i didn't grab your heart this time .
i guess i already have it .
remember that birthday when you were on the island?
you sure got a great gift .
get ready , because tonight i've got another for you .
from me .
are you proposing?
remember my sister?
the one who's a nurse?
well , she's become close friends with a girl whose baby she helped deliver four years ago .
a little girl .
speaking of babies ...
how's the novel?
all the stalling ...
what do i tell my editors?
you always think of something .
sure , that's why you get all your stories from me .
write this one as is .
it's unbelievable .
why's that?
by the way , don't worry ... ... about my sister , she doesn't know it's you .
or the mother ... ... who gave birth , i don't even know her .
i kept you secret .
why secret?
well , the baby girl was born here in madrid .
but she was conceived on a beach , on an island , a night like tonight , with a stranger ... from madrid .
it was his birthday .
if you write this well , it'll be the story of your life and my birthday gift to you .
i know where to find the kid .
afternoons in a square .
without the mother .
what's her name?
the mother?
no , the daughter .
your daughter's name is luna .
of course .
luna .
what's your name?
luna .
what's the sun's name?
lorenzo .
lorenzo .
just like me .
what's the moon's name?
you want the job?
yes .
then the moon's name is luna .
today was an important day .
you don't know your father? .
you've never seen him?
do you know his name?
no .
don't worry , names don't matter .
would you like it if ... ... i were your dad?
could you be?
yeah , if you want me to be .
but in secret .
my real father?
he thought it was a very big secret for such a small little girl .
his smile faded .
then he went over and sat along side her .
do you know what happens lf someone discovers the secret ... ... between the moon and the sun?
like mountains caving in .
maybe someday he'd find a way to tell her , so for the time being he left it at that .
what was the point of being a father ... ... if she didn't know?
he knew then that lf he'd told her , she'd have kept the secret .
secret .
you have a daughter?
lorenzo , honey .
do you?
why do you ask?
i saw it on your computer .
and i loved it .
i can't keep writing it .
why not?
i don't know what it is to be a father .
then make it up .
i'm glad you're writing again .
i was feeling guilty .
none of it is your fault .
luna doesn't know her dad .
she lives alone with her mom?
no , with a dumb soccer player .
i've never seen my dad .
me , neither .
my mother's an actress .
a porn actress .
i like that .
she quit last year .
she met this amazing guy who was a client , and fell for him .
now we live together .
he retired her .
sounds nice .
he's the sweetest guy ...
he has the biggest heart ever .
and he's handsome .
he's really sexy .
you like him , too?
me?
why?
can you tell?
you like him a lot?
okay , drop it .
would you do him?
no !
he's my mother's lover .
poor thing , she's in love for once .
do you think he likes you?
if he offered , and your mom never found out?
just once , as a test .
a test , right?
this is between you and me .
just once?
yeah .
why not?
because .
i don't know ...
i hope i never get put to the test .
but she put him to the test .
one morning when her mother was shopping , she took a shower and left the door open .
it almost happened .
what did?
the test .
with antonio .
tell me about it .
last night , when they went to bed ,
i put one of my mom's movies on .
it's strange , but ...
seeing her in action gets me hot .
you masturbated .
you always guess .
i took one of her dildos from her room while they slept .
i lay naked on the sofa , in the dark , in front of the tv .
i started copying her sexual positions .
their lust almost killed them .
he covered her mouth so her mother wouldn't wake up .
we decided not to tell my mom .
and to never do it again .
i promised antonio i'd find myself a boyfriend right away so i'd have someone to play with .
here , i'll loan you my mom for a couple days .
i masturbated because of you , but ended up thinking of him .
but we didn't do it .
i'm not even sure i saw him .
i just felt him .
spying on me from behind .
at least i think so .
how nice !
you never greet me this way anymore .
i should get home early every night .
your mom was great .
quite an actress .
you got off?
yes .
if only i'd seen you through a small hole in the wall .
are you beln's boyfriend?
would you like him to be?
yeah , sure .
then that's that .
i have to sleep ... ... at luna's tonight .
her parents are going out .
i can ask if my boyfriend can come along .
she's really cool .
what's her name?
elena .
well ,
i'd prefer just to see you and luna , no one else .
why the boyfriend?
can't they wait?
she asked me as a special favor .
maybe they can't .
they'll fuck .
good for them .
we don't even know him .
and in our bed?
you're just like your dog .
hi , boyfriend .
the doors are open .
be nice to him or i'll have to castrate you .
you hear me?
delicious .
you're a great cook .
and what do you do?
you won't tell me?
i'll get it out later .
i want some water .
before i met luna i thought i'd never have kids .
wouldn't you want a daughter like her?
of course .
to me ...
you'll always be my first .
and to you?
the first and only .
can i watch tv?
it's late , go to bed .
if lorenzo tucks me in .
you'll have to show me where .
and a kiss?
can you tell stories?
of course , that's my job .
did you know that island has the lowest moon?
that's right .
but only a few of us ... ... in the world know it .
it also has ... great weather , and it grants wishes .
if you need something , the rocks below the shore ... ... give it to you as a gift .
but watch out for the holes in the ground .
though it doesn't matter , because ... ... no one ever dies there .
for example , if you fall , you can choose any life you want .
you can be your favorite fish .
the island was glad when the girl arrived , especially the rocks below the shore , so they decided to give her something .
but what?
a raft .
bigger .
a dog .
no .
something she didn't have .
her father .
bull's eye , butterfly .
tonight you keep watch outside .
all she had to do was
iook everywhere for him until she found him .
her father could be whoever she wanted .
but then the girl had doubts , like everyone .
would she choose a lighthouse keeper daddy or a fisherman daddy?
she knew one thing : what she really wanted ... ... was her mother to become a beautiful mermaid .
she's asleep .
beln , i want you to know something .
i changed into this , do you mind?
hi , it's elena .
is beln there?
yes .
it's elena .
hello?
how are you?
better .
i'm improving .
and you?
well , i haven't cried .
i can't .
i haven't seen her .
they told me , but i don't understand .
i don't want to imagine it .
that's why i came here .
to be closer to her by swimming in the sea .
cry , beln .
now that you can .
it helps me to hear you cry .
that's lt .
cry .
cry .
you need to cry .
she hears you , too .
a big kiss from the sea ... from both of us .
lately you're always in bed .
you know what time it is?
it's a beautiful day .
sunny and clear .
and it's my day off .
get up , lazybones !
do you need all ... ... these pills just to sleep?
you never had problems sleeping before .
lorenzo , honey .
i'm worried about you .
you've been depressed for days .
trouble with the novel?
is that it?
you look terrible .
something's happened .
what?
you're sweating .
i've left , and there's no coming back .
your life ... ... is more important than your novel .
than any novel .
writing is vital to you , but you need to take care of yourself .
you're too good a person to see the shit i have inside .
stop , that's enough .
i have a confession .
so you see how close i am .
i've been reading the novel .
everything you've written .
at night , when you're asleep .
do you mind?
i understand why you're so affected , why you reject it , and why it's hard for you to go on .
it can't be easy , living there , in that house , with that stormy relationship .
so much repressed desire , impossible to control .
he's coming between a mother and her daughter , breaking a sacred bond .
but the passion's there , too .
the promptings of the blood bombing .
i identify with her .
i understand exactly how she feels .
disgusted , guilty , selfish ...
her mom's jealousy ...
but she's forced to choose ... ... between passionate love for a man , and love for a mother .
i'd have chosen the same .
such decisions are made by gut instinct .
sex ...
the thick , burning lust filled the mother , the man and the daughter .
they were sex crazed .
the stench of raw sex ...
the mother and the man ,
the man and the daughter , the daughter and the man .
all the man's poisoned love ...
alone with the daughter , the daughter and the man ...
the smell was ... heavy , hot , overwhelming ...
stuffy ...
stale air .
exhausted ...
the paint fell from the corners of the room ... ... and the walls became rocky ,
iike those in a cave .
a filthy den of ...
get out !
relax .
just wanted to let you know that i'm here .
the man was selfish , a coward .
he hated himself so deeply , so utterly , there wasn't even ... ... time for forgiveness .
only time for death .
death , death , death , death .
beln's fine .
she's home with her family .
forget the whole thing .
you've suffered enough .
will i ever read the novel?
of course .
another thing .
tell me about elena , too .
my sister writes to her on line .
she's on that mediterranean cooking chat everyday .
her nick is " alsi " .
" alsi "?
a l s i.
that's spanish for " island " backwards .
hi , alsi .
how are you?
i don't know you .
it's better that way .
i'm here to help .
what's your nick?
i don't understand the icon .
it's a lighthouse for your island .
are you the keeper?
yeah .
i have a story for you , it's full of advantages .
i'd like that .
thanks .
the first advantage is at the end of the story .
it doesn't finish , it falls in a hole .
and the story starts again halfway .
the other advantage , and the biggest ,
is that you can change course along the way ...
if you let me .
if you give me time .
all the time you want .
go on , please .
to be continued .
what happened?
why are you so late?
my boss invited me to dinner .
he wanted me to try a new dish .
did you screw him?
what?
did you go to bed with him?
that's right , you guessed it .
and how was it?
tell me about it .
no .
you first .
what's going on?
what's your problem?
i lost track of you ages ago .
you're not alive !
was it the first time with him?
the second .
the first was before we met .
or should i say before i proposed?
so it doesn't count .
you could have told me before .
yeah , i could have .
and today?
well ...
it doesn't count , either .
it's a lie .
but we came close .
how close?
did you stop or did he?
what about you stopping with me?
lorenzo , do you love me?
i need to hear you say it right now .
yes .
deeply .
more than myself .
but i'm lost .
then let me help you .
you don't deserve this .
why not?
i'm your girlfriend , and i love you more than myself .
come on , it's obvious .
you're draining my life away .
i'm doing all i can to get back , and accept myself , but if i can't , don't wait for me .
i wouldn't , either .
what happened to you?
beln , it's elena .
how are you?
it's real hot here .
why don't you come out?
the sea will do you good .
i have a guesthouse for the whole summer .
i'll have a room free in august .
upstairs .
my best room .
you'll watch the sunset ... ... from your bed .
bring someone if you want .
well?
the truth is , i'd love to visit an island ... with someone .
then that's it .
it's difficult , elena .
dlfficult?
nothing is here .
all the bad's left behind .
just bring along the good .
right .
the good up front .
i really want to see you , but here .
i don't want to lose touch .
say you'll come .
promise me .
i promise
i'll try .
good bye .
forgive me , luca .
i've got to end this .
i'm going to kill them for once and for all .
both of them .
right now .
if you've stopped being a writer , you have to ... ... explain why .
you're holding back .
if you don't tell me ,
i'll never forgive you !
you hear me?
never !
i can't talk like this .
talk?
you're the one who won't talk .
you keep it all inside .
you won't let me help you .
everything's you .
i'm crumpled up in the corner .
look .
you were meant to live alone , and to suffer alone .
and to poison yourself with your fucking doubts , which i don't understand .
you're sick , lorenzo .
sick of yourself , of your own standards , and nothing else .
of your fucking secrets !
you keep me around , but in the dark .
because my complaints don't count .
because you don't give a fuck what happens to me .
your troubles are so deep ,
i'm fucking stupid , and all you care about is if i screw my boss or not .
i'm exhausted .
you're driving me nuts .
i'll be late to work .
enjoy your hole .
have fun rotting by yourself .
look , i've never been this mean to anyone .
it's the last time i'll let myself talk like this .
it's for me , not you .
that's right .
it's time to think of myself , of my own needs .
because i see no future with you .
luca !
come over here and lie next to me .
relax , luca .
let the mud absorb all the bad .
later it'll wash away in the sea .
i don't want sex .
i'm not ready yet .
don't worry .
we'll just lie here , drying out in the sun .
yeah , he looks like carlos .
missing for 6 months " .
manuela and beln lozano , mother and daughter , and antonio castillo , were all living together .
if anyone knows where they are , please contact the police .
the police?
we'll ... act like we didn't see this ,
iike nothing's happened .
we know he lived with two women .
mother and daughter .
yeah , and the daughter ...
what?
the daughter was taking care of ... my daughter .
they left without him , quietly , without saying goodbye .
as he slept ,
like in a dream .
when he woke , he felt the two lifeless women ... .. were still with him ,
like any morning at that hour .
and he lay still , wishing his life would also ... ... leave him , through his blood .
what good was his blood now?
he wished it softly , wlthout real intent .
and he chose to escape , to start over , to be new .
to change his whole blood .
so he said goodbye and left .
we should give him a chance .
don't we all deserve one?
just in case , if in doubt , isn't it better to trust people?
right?
so when he gets back , we'll ask him to explain .
it's better this way .
especially for you .
for me?
i just want to forget .
you can't forget some things .
in this house you can .
that's why we're here .
then it's too late .
i should have come before .
when there was time ...
for lorenzo .
i wanted him to show me the island .
i asked him to , but he wouldn't .
it would have been his birthday soon .
what day?
the 23rd .
of may?
we could have celebrated here on the island .
maybe even with you .
who knows if we'd have met , right?
right .
when was lorenzo here?
a long time ago .
before we met .
how long ago?
about six years ago .
yeah .
i think he turned 25 here .
luca ...
what is it?
i'm overwhelmed ...
but i can't cry .
don't worry .
you don't have to .
i'm the one who should cry over him .
i'll just faint , then .
it's the sea .
must be high tide .
i'll never cry again .
i'm going to bed .
what's going on?
luna , spring of 1988 " .
luna .
why bother being a father if she didn't know?
he knew then that lf he'd told her , she'd have kept the secret .
luca , never talk to me about this .
i don't want to hear it .
well , i do .
he's out diving .
beneath the island .
do you like carlos?
i don't anymore .
go ahead , he's all yours .
i won't even be jealous .
what are you doing?
asking a friend for advice .
i don't know him , but i'm getting to like him .
he's been writing me since i got here .
he made up ... ... a sweet story to help me .
he taught me to forget .
and to escape pain .
want to read it?
you could get into it .
it's full of advantages .
because in the end ... there's a hole to escape through .
back to the middle .
to change course , if you want .
that's his icon , it's a lighthouse .
but it has no keeper , it must be a computer .
maybe his .
you'll meet my daughter .
i can't read this .
why not?
it will grab me .
and won't let go .
that's good .
did you finally do it?
do what?
change course?
not all the way , there wasn't time .
that's why i'm writing him .
where's the keeper?
don't write him .
there's nothing more the poor man can do .
has he written you since i first got here?
hi , lorenzo .
how are you?
your face says it all .
they called to say you were more awake .
do you know who i am?
pepe .
thank god .
glad to have you back .
you'll be writing in no time .
where's luca?
it says here that ... .. your craneal hematoma has subsided .
and the rest of your bruises are history .
where's luca?
you were in bad shape .
we didn't think you'd make it .
how long have i been here?
well ...
one week in a coma , with this horrible respirator ...
and two more weeks breathing on your own , but unconscious .
and in this room since four or five days ago , blabbering in your sleep .
and when you'd wake up , you were out of it .
we haven't heard from luca .
i looked everywhere .
she hasn't been to your place , nor the restaurant , since the night of your accident .
lorenzo .
i think luca believes you're dead .
that's why she left .
i talked to the ambulance guy .
he said a cop called your house and talked to her .
he mentioned the car ... ... and she hung up .
he tried to call back but she wouldn't answer .
i need to pee .
do it there ,
in the pan .
no way !
wait , wait .
thanks , pepe , but i can manage .
lose the attitude .
i've helped you all week .
you just don't remember .
i know where she might be .
you came by car?
as soon as they called .
good morning .
tell me right now why you're here and beln isn't .
you see?
i don't want to forget anymore .
thanks to you , honey .
well?
won't you answer me?
it's time to show you who i really am , no more stories .
were you there with beln , in my room , ...
... when that fucking dog killed my daughter?
it wasn't me .
it wasn't?
then why are the cops looking for you?
beln was with some guy who met her in the park with your daughter .
but he disappeared after that night .
what about beln?
where is she?
since you know everything .
she left with her mom but didn't tell me where .
she changed in the end , and chose her mom over me .
can't blame her .
a mother always comes first .
i don't trust you anymore , antonio ...
i won't ask you any more questions .
i'll leave that to the police .
lying to them won't be so easy .
look how brave i got all of a sudden .
wait .
please don't call the police .
why not?
are you holding back anything else?
i've no one left ... ... who i can trust .
where are you going?
making a get away?
they'll track you down !
if you call the cops ,
i'll leave , too .
are you stupid?
yes .
where are you going?
i don't understand .
i trust carlos , and i believe him .
i want to know more .
that's the easy part .
believing what you want .
what pleases you .
i did that , too .
until tonight .
i'll chase whom ever i please !
men matter less and less to me .
that's my lot .
they've never given me anything .
except sex .
no?
what about the keeper?
what?
besides wild sex and a daughter?
don't forget that story full of advantages that he wrote just for you !
that's right .
maybe your boyfriend was the last
good man on earth .
no , he wasn't .
you're wrong , but that's my business .
and i suppose carlos is also your business .
yours alone .
you're the only one chasing him .
yeah .
come to think of it ,
i always chase men .
when i like them .
to each his own , right?
where could he be?
i don't know .
i'm going home .
you guys cook tonight .
i'm so sorry .
carlos !
it's me , luca .
i want to come down .
come and help me .
i know how to dive , too .
what did you think?
luca .
it's me , elena .
where's carlos?
down there .
did he escape?
maybe he's dead .
if he turns up , we have to believe him , okay?
whatever you want .
that's right .
he's a crab .
let's go home .
what for?
to eat .
so early?
i'm not hungry .
tough .
it's about time you helped me cook .
we'll make a special meal and we'll be together and have fun .
you're a gift to this earth .
elena .
you're crying .
tears of happiness , which is what i am from now on .
great .
i hope it's contagious .
piece of cake .
let's go .
the first advantage ls at the end of the story .
it doesn't finish ,
it falls ln a hole .
and the story starts again halfway .
the other advantage , and the biggest ,
is that you can change course along the way ...
if you let me .
if you give me time .
a ray of sunshine ...
