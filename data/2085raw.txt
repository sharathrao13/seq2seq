my mind is clearer now
at last , all too well
i can see
where we all soon will be
lf you strip away
the myth from the man
you will see
where we all soon will be
jesus
you've started to believe the things they say of you
you really do believe this talk of god is true
and all the good you've done will soon get swept away
you've begun to matter more
than the things you say
listen , jesus i don't like what i see
all i ask is that you listen to me
and remember
i've been your right hand man all along
you have set them all on fire
they think they've found the new messiah
and they'll hurt you when they find they're wrong
i remember when this whole thing began
no talk of god then we called you a man
and believe me
my admiration for you hasn't died
but every word you say today
gets twisted 'round some other way
and they'll hurt you if they think you've lied
nazareth , your famous son should have stayed a great unknown
like his father carving wood he'd have made good
tables , chairs and oaken chests would have suited jesus best
he'd have caused nobody harm no one alarm
listen , jesus do you care for your race
don't you see we must keep in our place
we are occupied
have you forgotten how put down we are
i am frightened by the crowd
for we are getting much too loud
and they'll crush us if we go too far
lf we go
too far
listen , jesus to the warning i give
please remember that i want us to live
but it's sad to see our chances
weakening with every hour
your followers are blind
too much heaven on their minds
it was beautiful but now it's sour
yes , it's all
gone sour
oh oh , oh oh oh oh oh oh , oh oh oh oh
listen , jesus to the warning i give
please remember that i want us to live
so come on , come on he won't listen to me
ah , ah ah ah oh oh oh
come on , listen listen to me
come on and listen to me
ah , ahh oh oh oh oh
come on listen to me
come on , listen listen to me
ah ah ahh ohh , oh oh ohh
come on listen to me
listen to me

it seems to me a strange thing
mystifying
that a man like you can waste his time
on women of her kind
hey , cool it , man .
yes , i can understand that
she amuses
but to let her kiss you and stroke your hair
that's hardly in your line
it's not that i object to her profession
but she doesn't fit in well with what you teach and say
it doesn't help us if you're inconsistent
they only need a small excuse
to put us all away
who are you to criticize her
who are you to despise her
leave her , leave her let her be now
leave her , leave her she's with me now
lf your slate is clean then you can throw stones
lf your slate is not then leave her alone
hey , jesus , what do we say?
i'm amazed that men like you
can be so shallow thick and slow
there is not a man among you who knows or cares if i come or go
no , you're wrong you're very wrong
no , you're wrong you're very wrong
no , you're wrong you're very wrong
no , you're wrong you're very wrong
how can you say that how can you say that
how can you say that how can you say that
not one .
not one of you !
we've been sitting on the fence for far too long
why let him upset us
caiaphas , let him be
all those imbeciles will see
he really doesn't matter
jesus is important
we've let him go his way before
and while he starts a major war
we theorize and chatter
he's just another scripture thumping hack from galilee
the difference is they call him king
the difference frightens me
what about the romans?
when they see king jesus crowned
do you think they'll stand around
cheering and applauding
what about our people
lf they see we've lost our nerve
don't you think that they deserve
something more rewarding
they've got what they want
they think so anyway
lf he's what they want
why take their toy away
he's a craze
put yourself in my place i can hardly step aside
cannot let my hands be tied
i am law and order
what about our priesthood
don't you see that we could fall
lf we are to last at all
we cannot be divided
then say so to the council
but don't rely on subtlety
frighten them or they won't see
then we are decided
then we are decided .
try not to get worried try not to turn onto
problems that upset you
don't you know everything's all right
yes , everything's fine
and we want you to sleep well tonight
let the world turn without you tonight
lf we try , we'll get by so forget all about us
tonight everything's all right , yes
everything's all right , yes
sleep and i shall soothe you calm you and anoint you
myrrh for your hot forehead ah
then you'll feel everything's all right yes , everything's fine
and it's cool and the ointment's sweet
for the fire in your head and feet
close your eyes close your eyes
and relax think of nothing
tonight everything's all right , yes
everything's all right , yes hey , hey , woman
your fine ointment brand new and expensive
should have been saved for the poor
why has it been wasted we could have raised maybe
three hundred silver pieces or more
people who are hungry people who are starving
they matter more than your
feet and hair
try not to get worried try not to turn onto
problems that upset you oh
don't you know everything's all right all right , yes
everything's all right , yes surely you're not saying
we have the resources
to save the poor from their lot
there will be poor always pathetically struggling
look at the good things you've got
think while you still have me
move while you still see me
you'll be lost and you'll be sorry
when i'm gone [ mary magdalene ]
sleep and i shall soothe you calm you and anoint you
myrrh for your hot forehead oh
then you'll feel everything's all right , yes
everything's fine and it's cool and the ointment's sweet
for the fire in your head and feet
close your eyes close your eyes and relax
think of nothing tonight tonight close your eyes and relax
think of nothing close your eyes , close your eyes
and relax everything's all right , yes
close your eyes close your eyes and relax everything's all right , yes
close your eyes close your eyes and relax everything's all right , yes

miracle wonderman hero of fools
no riots , no army no fighting , no slogans
one thing i'll say for him jesus is cool
we cannot leave him to his own devices
his half witted fans will get out of control
how can we stop him his glamour increases
by leaps every minute he's top of the pole
i see bad things arising
the crowd crowned him king which the romans would ban
i see blood and destruction
our elimination because of one man
blood and destruction because of one man [ all ]
because , because , because of one man
our elimination because of one man
because , because because of one
cause of one cause of one man [ priest ]
what then to do about this jesus mania [ annas ]
oh , how do we deal with the carpenter king [ priest ]
where do we start with a man who is bigger
than john was when john did his baptism thing
fools , you have no perception
the stakes we are gambling are frighteningly high
we must crush him completely
so like john before him this jesus must die
for the sake of the nation this jesus must die [ all ]
must die , must die this jesus must die
so like john before him this jesus must die
must die , must die this jesus must , jesus must
jesus must die

a most amazing man
he had that look you very rarely find
the haunting , hunted kind
i asked him to say what had happened
how it all began
i asked again he never said a word
as if he hadn't heard
and next the room was full
of wild and angry men
they seemed to hate this man
they fell on him and then
disappeared again
then i saw thousands of millions
crying for this man
and then i heard them mentioning my name
and leaving me the blame
pilate
roll on up , jerusalem come on in , jerusalem

close your eyes close your eyes
and forget all about us
tonight
i don't know how to love him
what to do how to move him
i've been changed
yes , really changed
ln these past few days when i've seen myself
i seem like someone else
i don't know how to take this
i don't see why he moves me
he's a man
he's just a man
and i've had so many men before
ln very many ways
he's just one more
should i bring him down should i scream and shout
should i speak of love let my feelings out
i never thought i'd come to this
what's it all about
don't ya think it's rather funny
i should be in this position
i'm the one who's always been
so calm , so cool no lover's fool
running every show
he scares me so
i never thought i'd come to this
what's it all about
yet if he said he loved me
i'd be lost i'd be frightened
i couldn't cope
just couldn't cope
i'd turn my head i'd back away
i wouldn't want to know
he scares me so
i want him so
i love him
so
now if i help you it matters that you see
these sordid kind of things are coming hard to me
it's taken me some time to work out what to do
i weighed the whole thing out before i came to you
i have no thought at all about my own reward
i really didn't come here of my own accord
just don't say i'm
damned for all time
i came because i had to i'm the one who saw
jesus can't control it like he did before
furthermore , i know that jesus thinks so too
jesus wouldn't mind that i was here with you
i have no thought at all about my own reward
i really didn't come here of my own accord
just don't say i'm
damned for all time
annas , you're a friend a worldly man and wise
caiaphas , my friend i know you sympathize
why are we the prophets why are we the ones
we see the sad solution know what must be done
i have no thought at all about my own reward
i really didn't come here of my own accord
just don't say i'm
damned
for all time
cut the protesting forget the excuses
we want information get up off the floor
we have the papers we need to arrest him
you know his movements we know the law
your help in this matter won't go unrewarded
we'll pay you in silver cash on the nail
we just need to know where the soldiers can find him
with no crowd 'round him then we can't fail
i don't want your blood money
oh , that doesn't matter our expenses are good
i don't need your blood money
but you might as well take it we think that you should
think of the things you can do with that money
choose any charity give to the poor
we've noted your motives we've noted your feelings
this isn't blood money it's a
a fee .
a fee , nothing more
on thursday night
you'll find him where you want him
far from the crowds
ln the garden
of gethsemane [ chorus ]
so long , judas
so long , judas [ jets roaring ]
look at all my trials and tribulations
sinking in a gentle pool of wine
don't disturb me now
i can see the answers
till this evening is this morning
life is fine
always hoped that i'd be an apostle
knew that i would make it if i tried
then when we retire
we can write the gospels
so they'll still talk about us when we've died
the end
ls just a little harder
when brought about
by friends
for all you care
this wine could be my blood
for all you care
this bread
could be my body
the end .
this is my blood you drink
this is my body you eat
lf you would , remember me
when you eat and drink
i must be mad thinking i'll be remembered
yes , i must be out of my head
look at your blank faces my name will mean nothing
ten minutes after i'm dead
one of you denies me one of you betrays me [ apostles shouting ]
no !
no !
peter will deny me
no , not me !
ln just a few hours
three times will deny me and that's not all i see
one of you here dining one of my 12 chosen
will leave to betray me
cut out the dramatics you know very well who
why don't you go do it?
you want me to do it?
hurry , they are waiting lf you knew why i do it
i don't care why you do it
to think i admired you well , now i despise you
you liar , you judas you wanted me to do it
what if i just stayed here and ruined your ambition christ , you deserve it
hurry , you fool hurry and go
save me your speeches i don't want to know
go , go
look at all my trials and tribulations
sinking in a gentle pool of wine
what's that in the bread it's gone to my head
till this morning is this evening
life is fine
always hoped that i'd be an apostle
knew that i would make it if i tried
then when we retire we can write the gospels
so they'll all talk about us when we've died
you sad pathetic man
see where you brought us to
our ideals die around us and all because of you
but the saddest cut of all someone had to turn you in
like a common criminal like a wounded animal
a jaded mandarin a jaded mandarin
like a jaded , faded faded , jaded , jaded mandarin
get out they're waiting
get out
they're waiting oh , they're waiting for you
every time i look at you i don't understand
why you let the things you did get so out of hand
you'd have managed better if you'd had it planned
a a a ah
always hoped that i'd be an apostle
knew that i would make it if i tried
lf i tried
lf i tried
then when we retire we can write the gospels
so they'll still talk about us
when we've died
will no one stay awake with me
peter , john , james
will none of you wait with me
peter
john
james
i only want to say
lf there is a way
take this cup away from me
for i don't want to taste its poison
feel it burn me
i have changed
i'm not as sure as when we started
then , i was inspired
now
i'm sad and tired
listen
surely i've exceeded expectations
tried for three years
seems like 30
could you ask as much
from any other man
but if i die
see the saga through
and do the things you ask of me
let them hate me hit me , hurt me
nail me to their tree
i'd want to know i'd want to know , my god
i'd want to know i'd want to know , my god
i'd want to see i'd want to see , my god
i'd want to see i'd want to see , my god
why i
should die
would i be more noticed than i ever was before
would the things i've said and done
matter any more
i'd have to know i'd have to know , my lord
i'd have to know i'd have to know , my lord
i'd have to see i'd have to see , my lord
i'd have to see i'd have to see , my lord
lf i die what will be my reward
lf i die what will be my reward
have to know i'd have to know , my lord
have to know i'd have to know , my lord
why
why should i die
oh , why should i die
can you show me now
that i would not be killed in vain
show me just a little
of your omnipresent brain
show me there's a reason for your wanting me to die
you're far too keen on where and how
but not so hot on why
all right
i'll die
oh , oh just watch me die
see how
see how i'll die
oh h h
just watch me die
then
i was inspired
now
i'm sad and tired .
after all
i've tried for three years .
seems like 90 .
why then am i scared to finish
what i started
what you started
i didn't start it .
god
thy will is hard
but you hold every card
i will drink
your cup of poison
nail me to your cross
and break me
bleed me
beat me , kill me
take me now
before i change my mind
judas , must you betray me .
with a kiss

my god i saw him
he looked three quarters dead and he was so bad i had to turn my head
you beat him so hard that he was bent and lame
and i know who everybody's gonna blame
i don't believe he knows i acted for our good
i'd save him all this suffering if i could
don't believe our good
and i'd save him if i could
cut the confessions forget the excuses
i don't understand why you're filled with remorse
all that you've said has come true with a vengeance
the mob turned against him you backed the right horse
what you have done will be the saving of everyone
you'll be remembered forever for this
and not only that you've been paid for your efforts
pretty good wages for one little kiss
christ , i know you can't hear me
but i only did what you wanted me to
christ , i'd sell out the nation
for i have been saddled with the murder of you
i have been spattered with innocent blood
i shall be dragged through the slime and the mud
i have been spattered with innocent blood
i shall be dragged through the slime and the slime and the
slime and the mud
i
don't know how to love him
i don't know why he moves me
he's a man
he's just a man
he is not a king
he's just the same
as anyone i know
he scares me so
when he's cold and dead
will he let me be does he love
does he love me too
does he care for me
my mind is it's in darkness .
