delta , give me something .
they're on it !
they're on it !
who's pamela landy?
she's a task force chief .
is she running treadstone?
no , she's the deputy director .
why is she trying to kill me?
last week an agency field officer tried to make a buy off of one ofher ops .
he was trying to sell out a mole or something and you got to him before we did .
i killed him?
you left a print .
there were partial prints that trace back to treadstone .
they know it was you .
that is insane .
why are you doing this?
why come back now?
landy will find ...
stop .
stop .
last week i was 4, 000 miles away in india , watching marie die .
they came for me , and they killed her instead .
this ends now .
find her .
what do you people want with me?
why are you trying to frame me?
please !
i'm only here because of paris .
abbott dragged us ...
abbott?
who's abbott?
conklin's boss .
he he shut down treadstone .
is he here in berlin?
yes .
did he run treadstone?
did he run treadstone?
yes .
conklin reported to him .
please .
please , i swear ...
what was landy buying?
what kind of files?
conklin ...
stuff on conklin .
it was something to do with a russian politician .
neski .
wh what?
what are you talking about?
training is over ...
training is over ...
training is over ...
when ...
when was i here in berlin?
what are you talking about?
for treadstone .
i did a job here .
when?
no , you never worked in berlin before .
my first job .
in berlin .
you know my file .
you've never worked berlin before .
my first job !
no , your first assignment was geneva .
you fucking people !
i swear !
i swear !
i know i was here , nicky !
it's not in your file !
i know i was here !
no , i swear ...
oh , please . !
pam , i want to show you something .
it's alexanderplatz .
we got three levels , we got 15 tunnels .
they're all converging in a five block radius .
over here , luftschulzbunker .
that was an old war shelter .
how many men are out there?
two coming down the back stairs .
the rest , they're fanned out for a search .
what's our security situation here?
where , " here "?
the ground?
here here .
in the building .
check everything , and recheck all the stairwells , hallways , everything .
it's done .
okay , let's go public .
release his photo to the berlin police .
and check out his story about the girlfriend in india too .
i'm on it .
you're in a big puddle of shit , pamela , and you don't have the shoes for it .
he said he didn't know anything about berlin .
he knew that nicky was wearing a wire .
don't you think that was for our benefit?
he didn't sound like a man in control to me .
we know he was in berlin .
his mind is broken .
we broke it .
and now ...
what now?
terminate him?
you've been pushing that agenda ever since we got here .
he also said you were running treadstone .
should we believe that too?
i'm convinced bourne knows something .
he knows that you're after him , and in the interest of self preservation you might start with that .
check on those photos .
have they gone out?
i need to show you something .
all right , i finished my box work , but i wanted to show you before i showed landy .
came down here last night ... because none of this is making any sense .
i'm with you ...
conklin was a nut .
but a traitor?
i just can't get there .
what do you have , danny?
all right , you put a four gam kel on here , it's gonna take out power to the building .
you know that .
there were two charges that were supposed to go off simultaneously .
the second one , over here , didn't go off .
now , first of all , this is nothing .
it's a sub line for the breaker above .
and second , why put the charge all the way down here?
if you're good enough to get in here and handle the gear , you're good enough to know you don't need this .
bourne would know .
it was staged?
is it a slam dunk?
no .
but what if somebody were trying to cover their tracks by blaming conklin and bourne?
what if bourne didn't have anything to do with this?
show me again .
all right .
well , you put ...
pull over .
he's getting out .
this is not a drill , soldier .
we clear on that?
this is a live project , and you're a go .
i'll see you on the other side .
## [ piano ]
good evening , sir .
how can i help you?
i want to get a room for the night .
do you have a reservation?
no .
actually , is room 645 available?
i've stayed there before .
i'm sorry , sir .
that room is occupied .
how about room 644?
it's right across the hall .
sir?
644?
that's fine .
thank you .
i just need your passport and signature right here , please .
have a nice night .
ja .
berlin polizei .
where?
brecker hotel .
okay , we're there .
take the van !
brecker?
how far?
about five or six minutes .
hi . !
hey !
congratulations , soldier .
training is over .
polizei . !
polizei . !
go !
black coat , possibly leather , dark t shirt , dark pants .
the cops out there wanna corral all the guests together and check 'em out one by one .
that will really work .
what the hell's he doing here?
maybe he just wanted to stay the night .
polizei . !
polizei !
polizei !
polizei . !
polizei . !
polizei !
polizei !
they missed him?
yeah , so far .
but they found nicky .
she's back at the westin .
bourne let her go .
he let her go?
yeah .
where's danny zorn?
he ought to head over there and debrief her .
why did bourne come here?
we don't know yet .
landy's upstairs in one of the rooms .
she said she'd call you when she's done .
okay .
i think i'll , uh ... take a cab back to the hotel .
so , the room he checked into was across the hall .
mmm .
why would he come in here?
what are you thinking?
i recognize this room from a photo .
there was a chalk outline right here around the body of vladimir neski .
this is where his wife killed him?
do you still think his wife killed him?
guess he got out through this window .
we just got word from the berlin police .
they found danny zorn's body .
i want you two to stay on bourne .
check everything that's out there .
call abbott .
tell him to wait for me in his hotel .
i'm coming to see him .
da .
it's me .
they're onto neski .
this is not a clean phone .
they can't prove anything without bourne .
kill bourne , and you kill this investigation .
i'm afraid , ward , the time has come for us to part company .
listen , yuri , you bought those oil leases with 20 million in stolen c. i. a. seed money .
you owe me .
i gave you your cut .
we both got rich .
i don't owe you anything .
the plan can still be salvaged .
just get bourne .
you hear me?
he's still out there .
now get him .
getjason ...
i don't suppose it would do me much good to cry for help , huh?
not much .
you killed her .
it was a mistake .
it was supposed to be you .
there were files linking me to the neski murder .
if the files disappeared and they suspected you , they'd be chasing a ghost for 10 years .
so we got in the way .
is that why neski died?
is that why you killed marie?
you killed marie ... the minute you climbed into her car .
the minute you entered her life , she was dead .
i told you people to leave us alone .
i fell off the grid .
i was halfway around the world .
there's no place it won't catch up to you .
it's how every story ends .
it's what you are , jason ... a killer .
you always will be .
go ahead .
go on .
go on . !
do it . !
do it . !
she wouldn't want me to .
that's the only reason you're alive .
i'm a patriot .
i serve my country .
and danny zorn?
what was he?
unlucky .
collateral damage .
so , what do we do now?
i'm not sorry .
no , no , no , forget it .
call me as soon as he's here .
no , that's nothing .
good synch up .
who's this guy?
platform " b.
go ahead .
go on .
go on . !
do it . !
do it . !
she wouldn't want me to .
that's the only reason you're alive .
got a call from langley .
they're , uh , going through abbott's records , and marshall wants to know what's going on with bourne .
wait , teddy .
teddy , who's this?
look at this guy .
he's about to enter ...
right there . !
there . !
right through there .
that's bourne .
get down here !
we got something !
we got a sighting . !
check it out . !
there .
i got it on the big monitor .
hold on .
here it comes again .
whoa , whoa .
hold on .
he's just entered frame .
it's the coat .
that's him !
what train is that?
that's the train to moscow .
why the hell would he go to moscow?

you're older .
older than i thought you'd be .
that picture .
does that mean a lot to you?
it's nothing .
it's just a picture .
no .
it's 'cause you don't know how they died .
i do .
no , you don't .
i would want to know .
i would want to know that my ... that my mother didn't kill my father , that she didn't kill herself .
what?
it's not what happened to your parents .
i killed them .
i killed them .
it was my job .
it was my first time .
your father was supposed to be alone .
but then your mother ... came out of nowhere ,
and i had to change my plan .
it changes things , that knowledge .
doesn't it?
when what you love gets taken from you ,
you wanna know the truth .
i'm sorry .
pamela landy .
i hear you're still looking for me .
bourne?
what do you want?
i wanted to thank you ... for the tape .
we got what we needed .
it's all tied off .
it's over .
i guess i owe you an apology .
is that official?
no .
off the record .
you know how it is .
good bye .
wait .
wait .
david webb .
that's your real name .
you were born 4 15 71 in nixa , missouri .
why don't you come in and we'll talk about it .
bourne?
get some rest , pam .
you look tired .
# extreme ways are back again #
