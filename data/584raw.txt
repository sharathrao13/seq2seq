okay .
but first you have to hold on very tight .
okay .
ready?

i got it .
it's okay .
prot?
it's okay .
it's okay .
no , no , no , it's okay , betty .
where are his glasses?
i got it .
are you all right?
prot?
you're okay .
is that apple pie i smell?
sweetheart , you all right?
yeah .
he was pushing my daughter on a swing , like he had done a hundred times before .
not like he was some alien from k pax .
i saw him .
he was connecting with something .
some kind of normal life .
that's not enough .
he's a violent patient , mark .
he's not violent .
something violent happened to him .
something in his past .
when he was going after natalie , he wasn't trying to harm her , he was trying to protect her .
from the sprinklers?
i'm not sure from what .
i need more than a hunch to go on , otherwise i have to send him upstairs .
we need to regress him take him back into the past , find out what happened and have him confront it .
regress him?
do you have any idea how risky it is to regress a patient like this one?
it's his only chance .
claudia , we have to push him .
there's no time .
he told me that he's going back to k pax on july 27 .
that's in three weeks .
i think that he could become violent on that day .
hurt himself , somebody else .
you know what the problem is , mark .
you're too close to this patient .
everybody else can see it but you .
i am transferring him to the fourth floor , and that's final .
i know i'm too close to him .
all right , fine .
i admit it .
why choose this one to save , mark?
i don't know .
maybe maybe because i feel ... he chose me .
has anyone seen prot?
he went up north for a few days .
north "?
greenland .
iceland .
you know .
he had a few countries left to visit before he could finish his report .
don't worry , dr. powell .
he'll be back .
how do you know , ernie?
because he took his glasses with him , darling .
when he returns to k pax , he won't need them .
patients do not escape from this institution .
they don't escape .
there has been no evidence of escape , but obviously , i've notified the police , social services .
i'm gonna have a great time explaining this to the state board .
i got psychotics on the fourth floor packing up their sneakers ... because they all think they're going off to k pax .
claudia find him .
well , what about city shelters?
have you have you checked?
no .
no , i'm not telling you how to do your job .
uh thank thank you .
dr. powell , i presume .
where the hell have you been?
newfoundland , greenland , iceland , uh , labrador
all right , cut the crap .
we've been looking for you for three days .
i believe i mentioned my taking a trip up north , mark , in this very garden .
taking a trip?
you're a patient here .
you don't leave here without a discharge .
and don't give me this beam of light shit , because i don't buy it .
what would you say if i were to tell you ... that i don't believe you took any trip at all ... to iceland or greenland or anywhere?
that i don't believe you're from k pax?
i believe you're as human as i am .
i would say you're in need of a thorazine drip , doctor .
well , there there is one way ...
you could convince me beyond any doubt .
of course , i would need your consent .
it's called hypnosis .
i just don't see the point .
let me tell you what your alternative is .
a trip to a place where they'll stick a needle in your ass every morning , which may or may not leave you with a stupid grin on your face ... for the rest of your days here on earth .
is that what you'd like?
prot?
i want to help you .
what we're going to be doing , prot , is a bit like daydreaming .
i'm gonna count from one to five .
on the count of three , your eyes will close , and you will find yourself in a very nice , deep , comfortable , relaxed state of hypnosis .
one .
your eyes are starting to get very heavy now .
two .
i want you to use your imagination ... and imagine small lead weights on your eyelids ... that are just making them so ... heavy .
pulse rate is 40 b. p. m. three .
keep your eyes closed .
i'd be concerned if he were human .
let yourself go way , way down deep .
four .
let a wave of relaxation move through your body now ... as you go down even deeper .
and five , going way , way down deep .
you are in a relaxed state of hypnosis now .
how do you feel?
like ... nothing .
i want you to go back in time .
i want you to recall the first experience that you can remember .
what do you see?
what was that?
what do you see?
uh
i see ... casket .
silver ... with a blue lining .
whose casket is it?
it's the father of a friend of mine .
what's your friend's name?
i'm not telling .
do you know how your friend's father died?
he had an accident at the place that he worked at .
he was killed in an accident?
he he was hurt and then died later?
where did he work?
the place where they kill cows .
where is this place?
the pulse rate just shot up ten b. p. m. s .
do you know do you know where this place is?
i i want you to relax .
i want to move forward in time now .
where are you?
it's nighttime .
we're in his house .
at the other boy's house?
yeah .
i want him to come outside .
why?
to look at the stars .
that's where i come from , you know .
is your name prot?
wow .
how did you know that?
where are you from , prot?
i'm from the planet k pax .
it's in the constellation lyra .
do you know all the constellations?
yeah .
most of 'em .
and does your friend know them too?
yes , he does .
when his dad got sick and had to stay home , they got a telescope , and his dad taught him about all the constellations .
but he's not interested in those right now .
why not?
something happened .
that's why he called me .
he calls me when something bad happens .
like when his father died?
that's right .
how do you know to come?
how does the boy call you?
i don't know .
i just come .
i just i just know .
how do you get to earth?
i wanna go outside .
can i go outside?
uh , read read his body language , mark .
i i don't think he wants to talk anymore today .
all right .
prot?
i want you to just relax now .
think about the stars .
that's right .
i 'm gonna count backwards now from five to one , and you'll find yourself wide awake and refreshed .
five .
you're starting to come out of it now .
four .
you're feeling more alert .
three .
even more alert .
two .
you're becoming awake now .
and one .
so when do we begin?
it's already over .
oh , the old " fastest gun in the west " routine , huh?
let's find the locations of all the slaughter houses operating in the united states .
i mean , how many can there be?
i don't know .
we eliminate , uh , the ones in or near big cities ... and we concentrate on small towns , rural areas ,
you know , places where you can see the stars .
joyce , we only have six days .
shall i bring the crystal or leave it here?
i suppose i won't really need it on k pax .
i don't even know what they drink .
dream on , sister .
he can only take one of us with him .
why the hell would he take a stinker like you?
he's taking me .
how dare you !
i do not stink .
nah , forget it , ho .
i'm the one goin '.
yeah?
which one of you?
okay .
who would like to begin?
ernie .
uh , i i was i was wondering if it was possible ... for us to have cream of wheat instead of oatmeal .
not again .
howie .
i have a suggestion , because there's really , really not much time .
i would like to propose an essay contest ... to decide once and for all who will go with prot .
i've spoken with him , and he's agreed to read them all by july 27 .
so if anyone would like to be considered , please state your reasons in a clear , legible hand ... and return them to me .
russell .
yes?
would i get to take my bible to k pax?
of course you would .
we can finish the essays later .
now , i want you to go back in time again , but not so far back as last time .
is your friend there?
is he with you now?
yeah .
what's his name?
i'm not tellin '.
prot , i would like to know your friend's name .
well , i ain't gonna tell ya .
well , we have to call him something .
how about pete?
well , that's not his name , but whatever thrills you .
what year is it?
it's 1985 .
how old are you?
one hundred and seventy five .
how old is pete?
seventeen .
tell me about pete .
what happened?
is there a problem?
is that why he called you?
he's got a girlfriend .
and the problem is with the girlfriend?
she's pregnant .
he can see it all coming right down the road .
you get married , have a bunch of kids , wind up in the same job that killed your dad .
he blames her for this?
oh , no , no , no .
he doesn't blame her .
no , he just
he how did he put it?
he hates the chains that people shackle themselves with .
i mean , we don't have all that crap on k pax .
all right , prot .
i want you to listen to me carefully .
i want to move forward in time again .
oh , say , two weeks .
you
if you would like to open your eyes or move around , you may .
would you like to?
i know that .
prot?
prot , when it's , uh , 1991 , according to your earth calendar .
and your friend pete called you?
not for anything in particular .
he just ... sometimes wants to talk things over ... with someone every now and then .
tell me about pete now .
he's a knocker .
a " knocker "?
a knocker is the guy that knocks the cow inside of the head ... so it won't struggle while they slit its throat .
i know .
it's barbaric , isn't it?
does he still live in the same town?
oh , just outside of town .
he's got a little place , but he's fixed it up nice .
it's got some ... trees and a couple of acres ...
and a river .
it reminds me of k pax , except for the river .
tell me , did he ever marry that pregnant girl?
wow , what a memory .
yeah , they got married , but she's no longer pregnant .
why , that was six years ago .
i've forgotten her name .
s
i didn't tell you her name .
can you tell me now?
sara .
did they have a son or a daughter?
rebecca .
rebecca .
it's her birthday next week .
chak , what's happened?
howie tried to kill ernie .
what?
he's fine .
ernie?
i feel wonderful , dr. powell .
for heaven's sake .
what happened?
absolutely wonderful .
my good friend howie , he just about strangled me to death .
what?
son of a bitch , i love him .
ernie , i don't understand .
you should've seen it .
i was asleep .
you know , the way i like my hands tied and everything .
he wrapped something around my neck a handkerchief or something and then tightened it .
there wasn't a damn thing i could do about it .
well , when i stopped breathing , he lifted me onto the gurney , rushed me up here , and they brought me back as quick as they could .
and when i woke up ,
you know what i realized , dr. powell?
dying .
dying's something you have no control over .
why waste your life being afraid of it?
i'll sleep on my stomach from now on .
i'll eat fish with bones in it .
i'll swallow the biggest pill you can find .
bring it on .
i feel good .
that's terrific , ernie .
see you at our session tomorrow?
yes .
i cured him , didn't i?
prot says one more task and i'll be cured too .
and then it's ... bon voyage .
tell me your name , damn it .
i'm gonna give you a specific date , and i want you to remember where you were and what you were doing on that day .
do you understand?
perfectly well , my dear sir .
the date is july 27 , 1996 .

i'm now on earth .
i'm with him .
and where are you?
what are you doing?
by a river ... in the back of his house .
it's dark .
he's taking off his clothes .
why is he doing that?
he's what?
what is he doing?
he's trying to kill himself .
why does he want to kill himself?
because something terrible has happened .
has he done something?
has he done something he shouldn't have?
he doesn't want to talk about it .
prot , i'm trying to help him .
i can't help him unless he tells me what happened .
he knows that .
well , then , why won't he tell me?
because then you would know ... what even he doesn't want to know .
then you have to help him , prot .
you have to help him tell me what happened .
he doesn't want to talk about it .
are you fucking deaf?
time is running out for him .
time is running out for everyone .
he jumps in .
he's floating .

you're starting to come out of it .
four .
you're becoming more alert .
three .
even more alert .

you're starting to wake up now .
and one .

thank you .

new mexico , sir .

salva .
salvation .
salvation !
there are a dozen salvation army shelters in new mexico .
albuquerque , las cruces , roswell .
wait a minute .
there's one in santa rosa .
santa rosa .
santa rosa .
santa rosa .
guelph .
that's pretty damn close to santa rosa .
what's the biggest local newspaper for that region?
guadalupe county observer , covering guadalupe county .
all right .
bring that up .
go tojuly27 , 1996 .
'swap meet , livestock sale . '
wait .
go to the 28th .
okay .
there it is !
robert porter .
drowned !
his name ... is robert porter .
robert porter .
ah , here it is .
yeah , i do remember this case .
it was about the biggest thing ever happened around these parts .
he was a quiet type .
as i recall , he was a real smart fella .
kind of brainy .
strong as a horse , though , and worked as a knocker .
lived about 20 miles outside of town with his his wife and child .
sarah .
his wife's name was sarah .
that's right .
damn shame what happened .
you got time to take a ride?
yeah .
well , it's been empty .
yeah , nobody comes around here much anymore ... since all that happened .
ain't no livin 'next of kin to give the place to anyway .
i had detectives come down from albuquerque ... to try and piece this one together .
well , accordin 'to the official story ,
porter , he was at work when this , uh , this drifter ,
darryl walker , come by the house .
two time parolee lookin 'for trouble .
you know what i'm sayin '?
started out as a robbery .
the wife and the daughter were out back .
sarah?
sarah?
from what we can gather from forensics and all , this walker , he , uh he forced the two women into the house .
raped the wife , killed 'em both .
porter , he must've come home and found walker still here .
god .
snapped a grown man's neck like it was a twig .
can't say i wouldn't have done the same myself .
uh , the river's this way .
they found the clothes there .
that's probably where he jumped in .
and this river can be pretty treacherous .
even in july it's got a hell of a current .
still , i suppose it might have been a mistake , officially , to declare it a drowning when the body was never found .
doc , if that boy you got back there in new york is really robert porter ,
i'd just as soon not know about it .
know what i mean?
mark .
i'm sorry .
i'm sorry .
never do that again .
i won't .
what happened?
i found what i was looking for .
you sure?
yeah .
wish i hadn't .
# and i think it's gonna be a long , long time #
# till i touch down brings me round again to find #
# i'm not the man they think i am at home #
# oh , no , no , no #
# i'm a rocket man #
if you wouldn't mind putting mine on top .
# burnin 'out his fuse up here alone #
# and i think it's gonna be a long , long time #
prot .
have a seat .
you all packed?
ready to go?
quite ready .
i travel light .
that's a joke , mark .
you humans .
there's just no sense of humour .
i doubt , uh , freud ever tried this , but before someone goes away , we usually like to send them off with a little toast .
scotch okay , or would you prefer something more fruity?
i will try the scotch .
well , here's to a ... safe journey .
tell you the truth ,
k pax sounds like a beautiful place .
i'd like to see it sometime .
think there's a chance of that?
i think you should see more of your world .
as a matter of fact , i think you should see more of your own family .
invite your son for christmas .
i may just do that , prot .
you know what i've learned about your planet?
there's enough life on earth to fill 50 planets plants , animals , people , fungi , viruses all jostling to find their place , bouncing off each other , feeding off each other , connected .
you don't have that kind of connection on k pax?
nobody wants , nobody needs .
on k pax , when i'm gone , nobody misses me .
there would be no reason to .
and yet i sense that when i leave here ,
i will be missed .
yes .
strange feeling .
you don't have to leave , prot .
i'm sure there must be some way that i can help you ... to stay as one of us .
i will miss you , dr. powell .
oh .
and i have to finish my report , but ...
i seem to have misplaced my pencil .
take mine .
a much more efficient writing tool .
adios , my friend .
prot?
i wanna show you something .
that is robert porter .
prot , that's you .
you and robert porter are the same person .
that's patently absurd .
i'm not even human .
can't you at least admit the possibility?
i will admit the possibility that i am robert porter ... if you will admit the possibility ... that i am from k pax .
now if you'll excuse me ,
i have a beam of light to catch .
oh , mark .
now that you've found robert , please take good care of him .
# that nobody can deny #
# that nobody can deny #
# that nobody can deny #
# for he's a # i can't stand it .
i i can't stand this !
i demand to know ... which one of us is goin 'with you .
well , i can tell you this .
there's extra points for the one who goes to sleep first .
out of my way !
oh , my gosh .
you never gave me my last task .
what's my last task?
to stay here .
and be prepared ... for anything .
you look tired , doc .
why don't you get a few hours of rest?
he's not goin 'anywhere .
uh
we got seven hours .
i'll see you in four , hmm?
get some rest .
you're gonna eat .
you need some food and you need to sleep .
chow fun .
oh , the place on broadway with the ugly lanterns in the window?
the mean waiter always shouted at us .
their fortune cookies never had any fortunes in 'em .
we never needed any .
i knew my fortune that night .
he was sitting right in front of me .
hope he still is .
hey .
what's up , man?
look , 20 says he goes .
you're on .
shit !
oh , damn it !
two minutes .
you know where dr. powell is?
i'll buzz him .
one minute .
here comes dr. powell !
he's moving .
he's moving !
what the hell?
wait for me , you
son of a bitch .
oh , god .
oh , man .
oh , god .
call a code blue .
help me .
let's get him .
who's that?
beats me .
how'd he get in here?
that's not prot .
he's definitely not prot .
certainly not .
prot's gone .
where's bess?
where's bess?
bess?
he chose bess .
bitch !
good bye , bess .
good for you , homegirl .
bess went to k pax .
patient 287 , robert porter .
how i wish i could say that robert sat up one fine day ... and said , " 'i'm hungry .
got any fruit? '
like most catatonics , he probably hears every word we say ... but refuses or is unable to respond .
nevertheless , i keep him up to date .
let's see .
i told you about howie .
he got that job at the public library .
and ernie , he's determined to be a crisis counsellor .
the only one we're , uh , really concerned about is bess .
you know , we've checked halfway houses , shelters , churches , bus stops .
nothing .
uh , we don't understand .
it's like ... people don't just disappear .
july 27th?
you wouldn't happen to know anything about that , would you?
robert?
no .
well , maybe it'll come to you .
whenever you're ready , i'll be waiting .
i want to tell you something , mark , something you do not yet know , but we k paxians have been around long enough to have discovered .
the universe will expand , then it will collapse back on itself , and then it will expand again .
it will repeat this process forever .
what you don't know is that when the universe expands again , everything will be as it is now .
what ever mistakes you make this time around , you will live through on your next pass .
every mistake you make ... you will live through ... again and again , forever .
so my advice to you is to get it right this time around , because this time ... is all you have .
you're lookin 'great , michael .
think so?
thanks .
how you doin '?
good .
how was your how was your trip?
was it was it good?
