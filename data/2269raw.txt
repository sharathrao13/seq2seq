where there were numerous trees .
i couldn't find his trail
but heard the nanping bell .
the sound of the nanping bell
spread by the breeze ,

spread by the breeze ,
woke me from the dream of lovesickness .
it woke me from the dream of lovesickness .
lovesickness in vain .
as i walked out of the forest ,
i saw the beautiful sunset again .
