what's your pension number?
what?
i said what's your pension number .
that's ok .
money order notice
nothing .
but there's the notice .
there is nothing ... see for yourself .
when should i come?
perhaps when you get another notice .
hey !
your notice .
bloody mess !
miss poland is on .
i'm studying .
come and watch .
great , thanks .
my name is maugojata .
i'm 24 years old ...
entry number six , miss ...
i'm katajina .
i'm 20 years old .
i'm graduated from medical college .
hello?
hello?
enough of this idiocy .
who is it?
i hear you breathing .
you bastard .
hello?
i'm sorry .
milk wasn't delivered .
i get it only every other day .
would you like to deliver milk?
i haven't time .
neither has the milkman .
he sends you his best wishes ... and " ssla " ... what's that?
a code .
he'll see the world .
pity you couldn't go with him .
i'm not sorry .
from marcin .
what will happen to you when he gets back?
i'd like to see you settled down .
marcin likes travelling .
i'm afraid he won't stay home for long .
maybe you could go on living here .
gas emergency .
i want to report a gas leak .
you're sure of it?
i can smell it and hear it .
where's it leaking from?
the cooker .
what address?
piratowka , flat 376 .
we'll be there soon .
marcin wrote ... he went to the cinema with an arab girl .
i wonder what they saw .
tomek .
are you seeing somebody?
no .
i'm not sure whether you have been told this .
girls only pretend to be casual , they kiss boys easily ... but in fact ... they like tenderness .
if you'd like to bring someone here ... you needn't be shy about it .
i haven't anyone .
i'll wait .
how are you?
what do you want?
i heard you need someone to deliver milk .
do you want to deliver milk?
how old are you?
nineteen .
a student?
no .
i work in our post office .
you realize you must get up at five?
i get up early , anyway .
hello?
the milkman .
you didn't put a bottle out .
that's right .
son of a bitch !
tomek .
tomek .
not asleep?
come and sit down .
is something wrong?
why do people cry?
don't you know?
haven't you ever cried?
once , long ago .
when you were left?
people cry ... for various reasons .
when someone dies , when they're left alone ...
when they ... can't stand it anymore .
what?
living .
when they're hurt .
can you do anything about it?
once marcin had toothache he heated the iron and pressed it here .
he forgot about the tooth .
you before , wasn't it?
so?
another notice .
nothing .
it's the second time .
yes , but there's nothing .
a mess , eh?
really?
could you ask someone more senior?
what?
the manager , or someone .
wait a minute please .
what's the matter?
i don't know who's sent me money , but this is the second notice i've had .
no money is here .
you got the notice .
but not any money .
give that notice to me .
who did you expect money from?
no idea ... 24, 000 ...
so how did you know it was due?
i got two notices , didn't i?
but there's no money .
so why was i sent notices?
mr. bachek !
mr. bachek !
what's the matter , sir?
what notices are these?
well , notices .
it's your round .
did you issue them?
no , i write in pencil .
they were in my box .
not from us .
but they were in my box , your stamp is on them .
this is a state post office !
if you write your own notices ... it's a police matter .
right .
give me the notices .
no , they're forgeries .
you wanted to swindle us .
what do you want?
i want to tell you there was no money .
what about the notices?
i sent them .
why?
i don't understand .
i wanted to see you .
you wanted to see me?
you were crying yesterday .
how do you know?
i peeped at you .
what?
i watched you through the window .
clear off ... you meddler !
hello .
i'll count to three .
one ...
two ...
hello .
are you looking?
yes .
i've moved the bed , see?
yes .
have fun .
hey !
you shit !
postman !
come here !
come here , you bastard !
you , sweetheart?
put up your hands .
don't do it again .
very unhealthy at your age .
will you sleep?
i thought it would be you .
want to come in?
no one's here .
everything in good order?
you look terrific .
don't you know how to fight?
why are you peeping at me?
because i love you .
i really do .
and what do you want?
i don't know .
do you want to kiss me?
no .
perhaps you want to make love to me?
no .
want to go away with me?
to the lakes , or to budapest?
no .
so what do you want?
nothing .
nothing?
yes .
could i invite you out to a cafe ... ice cream ...
sorry .
have you been watching long?
a year .
this morning ... what was it you said?
i love you .
there's no such thing .
there is .
no .
apart from loving me and working in the post office , what do you do?
i study languages .
what have you learned?
bulgarian .
bulgarian?
great , but what for?
we had two bulgarians in the orphanage .
then english , french , italian .
now i'm learning portuguese .
you're a strange one .
no , i have a good memory .
i remember everything from the start .
even when you were born?
i think so , sometimes .
and your parents?
not them .
remember a thin boy who used to visit me in the autumn?
yes , he brought milk and rolls and took away parcels .
that's right .
he never came back .
i liked him .
so did i , but he left ... for austria , then australia .
australia?
yes .
i've been removing your letters .
i didn't know they were from him .
i work at the post office .
you besiege me , you bring the milk you send me false notices ... you send gas workers , you pinch my letters .
but it doesn't really matter .
haven't you any friends?
one , but he's not here now .
where is he?
he's with the un force in syria .
i lodge with his mother , opposite .
he's different from me .
i think so .
he peeped at you , too .
what did he tell you?
before he left he showed me your window and gave me his opera glasses .
what did he tell you?
ssla .
what's it stand for?
go ahead .
she ...
she?
quickly !
she spreads it around .
that's okay .
what would you like?
i don't like ice cream .
but i'll eat .
i'll have ice cream .
it's off .
what , then?
tea .
we've got that .
i'd like red wine .
two glasses of red wine , and tea .
okay .
give me your hand .
caress me .
look there !
they seem to know more about it .
our bus .
i have a good idea .
if we catch it , you're coming to my place .
if not , no .
agreed?
let's go !
such snow scenes are embroidered , too .
do i always do that?
not that i've seen .
not everything's routine .
where did you get that?
it's a souvenir .
it's yours now .
i'm not good .
don't give it to me .
you know i'm not good .
really .
i don't care .
i love you .
what else do you know?
what do you see when one of them is with me?
it's called ... making love .
i don't watch that any more .
it has nothing to do with love .
tell me what i do .
you undress .
then you undress them .
you go to bed , or on the floor .
and?
or in the kitchen .
you close your eyes ... then you lift your hands ... above your head .
show me how .
go on .
have you had a girl?
no .
and when you watch me do you do it with yourself?
i used to .
not now .
you know it's sinful .
now ...
i think only about you .
i have nothing underneath you know , don't you?
when a woman wants a man ... she becomes wet inside .
i'm wet now .
such delicate hands .
don't be afraid .
already?
that's all there is to love .
wash in the bathroom there's a towel .
i'm sorry .
please come back .
go back .
sorry .
did i wake you up?
no .
i'm looking for ...
he left his coat .
come in .
leave it there .
is he out?
no .
he's in hospital .
what happened?
nothing serious .
he'll be out in a few days .
i'd like to visit him .
he just left my place ...
i know .
i think that ...
i have hurt him .
don't visit him , he will be back .
what happened?
you'll probably find it funny .
he fell in love with you .
he watched you through this .
stolen , probably .
he used opera glasses before .
and he set this alarm clock for half past eight .
you come home then , don't you?
about then .
he made a bad choice?
yes .
i don't need much , but i'm afraid without someone in the house .
good night .

do you know his name?
you'll have to ask the manageress .
