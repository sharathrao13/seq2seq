hi .
i'm expecting a letter .
hold for guest arrival .
sure .
what's your name?
joan hart .
ah , joan hart .
platinum .
platinum?
as in platinum record .
as in a million units sold .
now , drive shaft's albums must've ... ... spiked when everybody found out that i died in some catastrophic plane disaster .
but when i come back?
alive !
it's gonna be insane .
so you think the raft's gonna work?
of course .
look at that thing .
it's not a raft .
they built a sodding boat .
when they get picked up , the helicopters will come , making us ridiculously and eternally famous .
what's the matter?
don't you want to be famous?
. . . what i think .
but the fact is . . .
what do you think's going on over there?
sure .
you can absolutely wait a few weeks before you launch .
i was just assuming you didn't want to die .
so , uh , when's the next time we can launch?
three ... maybe four months .
come on !
even a weatherman on tv don't know what's gonna happen .
why are we listening to arzt?
because i'm a doctor and you're a hillbilly .
you're a damn high school science teacher .
hey , sawyer , let's just let the man talk .
it's been raining every afternoon .
that means that we are on the cusp of monsoon season .
monsoon season is bad .
now , the trade winds are blowing north right now .
shipping lanes are north .
so north is exactly where you want to be .
what's that mean?
it means , when the monsoon season hits , the trade winds are gonna shift to the south .
the raft goes with the wind .
can anyone tell me what is the only piece of land that's south of us?
antarctica .
that's right , jack .
antarctica .
so when do we have to leave?
yesterday .
so obviously you believe him .
arzt?
i don't know .
but i'm not taking any chances .
you think you'll be ready by tomorrow?
man said not a day to waste .
supplies all set?
you got food , fresh water , every ...
look , kate , no offense , but i got work to do .
why the sudden interest?
because i'm going with you .
look , raft's full .
we need four , we got four .
look , raft's full .
we need four , we got four .
lncluding sawyer?
lncluding him .
we needed the stuff he had , so he bought his way on .
on the first raft , which burned .
i'm not gonna get into semantics .
i told the guy ...
he doesn't know how to sail .
and you do?
i spent two summers crewing j l boats .
i know my way around a sailboat .
yeah ... maybe so , but a deal's a deal .
i'm sorry .
you're bringing walt too?
i'm just saying it's dangerous .
i decide what's best for my boy .
and right now , what's best for him is to get the hell off this island .
the raft's full .
hospital chaplain to the neuro icu .
hospital chaplain .
please report to the neuro icu .
i have a delivery for diane jansen .
right .
she just came up from lcu .
she's in room 208 .
okay .
around the corner , to your right .
thanks .
you're welcome .
hey , tom .
holy ...
katie?
what are you doing here?
diane's dying of cancer .
i thought i owed it to her to come see her .
i heard .
i'm sorry .
yeah , me too .
so any particular reason why you're hanging out in the back of my car?
i need your help .
how much further?
we're almost there .
wanna tell me where we're going , sayid?
it's better that you see it for yourself .
no , i'm not so sure it is .
tell me why you brought me here or i turn around .
he brought you out here because i asked him to .
i asked him not to tell you .
i wanted you to have an open mind .
open mind about what?
my god .
what is this thing?
exactly .
i guess it's time we talked about this .
yo , chief !
dumb question here .
we're sailing out on the ocean right?
you mind?
sulu over here is packing a suitcase full of salted fish .
yeah?
we can't catch fish?
do you know anything about surviving at sea?
sailing?
navigating?
steering a raft?
do you?
doesn't matter what i know , i built it .
maybe you are the wrong guy to go on the raft .
you gonna vote me off , mickey?
and who the hell's gonna take my place?
what the hell you think you're doing?
sorry?
don't give me the " aw , golly " eyes .
michael just told me you were jockeying for my spot on the raft .
i was just asking some questions .
he must've misunderstood me .
i know what you're doing .
yeah?
yeah .
just like i know why you wanted that haliburton case so bad .
the one that belonged to the u. s. marshal who was flying with us .
you were his prisoner .
let go of me .
your only chance of running's getting on that raft , ain't it?
lf we get picked up by a ship , when they come back to rescue the rest of y'all , gonna be a nice big asterisk next to your name .
well , don't worry , puddin ', your secret's safe with me .
but just so you know , no way in hell you're getting my spot on that raft .
hey , sawyer !
i want your spot , i'll get your spot .
hey !
give me that water , man .
yo , dad !
thanks .
so , what were you and sawyer arguing about?
i told him something he didn't want to hear .
why does he wanna get on the raft so much?
'cause he knows it's gonna work .
when we get rescued , we're gonna come back for everybody else , right?
yeah .
sure .
of course .
but the thing is ... ... this island ... ... is ... finding it again might be hard .
can't we fly around and look for it?
absolutely .
but there's no guarantees .
that's why you and ...
dad?
ooh .
that's why you ... [ grunts ]
dad !
dad !
get jack .
help !
i need help !
it's my dad .
what's the matter?
his stomach is really bad .
take him back to michael .
i'll go get jack .
okay .
let's go .
this way .
jack !
jack !
how long have you known about this?
three weeks , give or take .
three weeks .
you've been out here for three weeks digging this thing up and you never told me?
all due respect , jack , but since when do i report to you?
all due respect , john , but you lied .
how long did you have that case full of guns before you decided the rest of us needed to know?
you used your best discretion .
i used mine .
so how do we open it?
what?
you want to open it?
yeah .
we should bury it .
i brought you here to talk him out of this insanity .
anything could be inside .
best case scenario , there's supplies .
worst case , we use it as a shelter .
actually , jack , i can think of much worse cases than that .
you notice anything about this hatch?
there's no handle .
could the reason for that be more obvious?
maybe it was never meant to be opened from the outside .
jack !
jack !
yeah !
over here !
it's michael .
something's wrong .
what'd you eat today?
fruit , fish .
drinking enough water?
two , three bottles .
where are you getting that water from?
the caves , like everybody else .
all right , listen , michael .
you just take it easy .
you stay in the shade .
you try not to move too much , okay?
we have to launch that raft tomorrow .
we have to .
i know .
i need you to lay back .
lay down .
just lay down .
okay?
hello?
hey , adam .
hey , listen , can you carve out some time for me on the mrl?
yeah , it's ... it's a favor for a friend of a friend .
oh , no , that'll work out great .
okay .
yeah , thanks , adam .
his name's connor .
how old is he?
twenty two months next week .
he's beautiful .
yeah , well , that's rachel , that's not me .
where is she?
she's over in cedar rapids visiting her folks .
they get back on sunday .
i got diane in for an mrl .
they'll bring her downstairs to radiology .
and her appointment's not until 5 am , so we've got about three hours to kill .
tom ...
you're welcome .
you think it's still there?
what?
you know what .
it's the middle of the night , katie .
we might not get another chance .
one , two , three , four , five , six .
what do you think it is?
heatstroke?
no .
he would've felt that coming on .
bad fruit , maybe?
raw fish?
michael and jin are on the same diet .
and jin's fine .
jin's fine .
whatever's making him sick was metabolized fast .
it hit him quick , and it hit him hard .
so you think it was the water?
no , i don't think it was the water .
i think it was something in the water .
feeling any better?
cramps are quieting down .
as long as i don't move , or ... or breathe .
you and locke kiss and make up?
good .
no , michael .
what?
drink from that one .
somebody did this to me?
i don't know .
i'm not sure of anything yet .
sawyer .
i'm on bamboo duty , but sometimes i help refill the water .
michael and jin getting along?
they fight like a married couple building a raft together .
you told him?
he thinks sawyer might've done it .
oh , 'cause of kate?
kate?
yeah , i guess she wants on the raft .
so sawyer went off on michael because he gets to decide who goes .
you don't think kate did it?
why would kate poison michael?
well , you know , the whole fugitive thing .
he doesn't know?
how am i supposed to keep straight who knows what?
steve didn't know about the polar bear .
what did she do?
i don't know .
why don't you ask her?
you didn't think the others should know about this?
discretion , john .
okay , can you stop moving or i'm gonna cut your ear off .
this is good .
i'm writing again .
i'm really feeling it , as well .
so , what's the first thing you're gonna do when we get rescued?
you know , i don't really know .
you can hang out with me in la .
you and turnip head .
you know , until you figure things out .
thanks .
smashing .
okay .
check this out .
this is track two .
it's called ...
sorry .
it's called monster eats the pilot .
how's michael?
he's gonna be fine .
ls somebody gonna be taking his place on the raft?
i don't know .
dr. arzt said if they don't leave ...
did you poison michael , kate?
what?
he's not sick .
someone did this .
do you really think i'm capable of that?
i don't know what you're capable of .
you brought beer?
no self respecting man in lowa goes anywhere without beer .
it's not fair , you know , you coming back .
here .
home .
yeah , i know .
wow .
wow !
look at this stuff .
oh , my god !
my plane .
i can't believe i let you talk me into putting this in there .
that was your idea .
kate and tom .
1 989 .
is it on?
i don't think it's on .
it's on .
okay , uh , this is kate austen and tom brennan .
and this is our dedication for our time capsule here on august 1 5th , 1989 .
hey , give me that back !
why are you putting this stupid plane in there?
because it's cool , katie .
i got it when i flew to dallas by myself .
ooh , that is cool !
just like this time capsule .
it'll be totally cool when we dig it up in , like , 20 years .
how do you know we'll be together?
'cause we'll be married .
you'll be a mom
and we'll have nine kids .
i don't think so .
as soon as i get my license , we should just get in a car and drive .
like , you know , run away .
you always wanna run away , katie .
yeah .
and you know why .
funny how things turn out , huh?
yeah .
sorry .
we better get to the hospital .
yeah .
what happened?
i had a little accident .
does it hurt?
yep .
something you wanna tell me , walt?
i didn't do it .
didn't do what?
i heard jack .
he thinks somebody got my dad sick .
and i didn't do it .
you think because i know you burned the first raft
i'd think you made your dad sick?
we're friends , aren't we walt?
i didn't tell on you before , and i'm not gonna now .
and i know you would never do anything to hurt your dad .
what's the matter?
don't open it .
what did you say?
don't open it , mr. locke .
don't open that thing .
what?
what thing?
what are you ...?
just don't open it !
thought you might need that , boss .
wouldn't want our pilot out of commission before takeoff .
what?
you feeling guilty?
what?
you're off the raft .
come again?
you're off the raft .
we had a deal .
well , the deal ended the minute you decided to poison me .
i did what now?
i'm done with you .
you ain't done with me by a damn sight .
you said you needed four .
i got four .
you've been stealing stuff off of dead bodies , keeping it for yourself , using it to buy favors .
you're a liar and a criminal !
i'm not letting you near my boy !
oh , i'm a criminal?
i poisoned you 'cause i'm a criminal?
get your hands off me , boy .
hey , sweet cheeks !
i had no idea how bad you wanted off this rock .
time to set things straight .
let go of me .
tell him who the criminal is .
leave her alone , man .
tell him .
give that back !
leave her alone .
" leave her alone .
give that back .
look !
look at this .
sawyer , please .
you all remember joanna , don't you?
huh?
the woman who drowned?
now , what's kate doing with poor joanna's ld?
could it be she'd do just about anything to get on that raft , so she could get herself rescued?
run off with a new identity before half the reporters in the world descend on this damn island?
she might poison the captain himself .
shut up .
she don't care about nothing or nobody but herself .
this is good here .
thank you .
my office is right back there .
i'll wait for you .
hi , mom .

yes .
i was on the plane ... ... with the marshal .
yes , i was wanted ... ... and caught and being transported back .
no matter what i say about what happened , about what i supposedly did ... ... l'm going to jail .
but i didn't poison you .
here .
there you go .
good .
there you go .
good .
he looks determined .
yes .
he is .
you don't want him to go , do you?
no .
ls that why you tried to make him sick?
michael and jin working together all the time , pretty easy for them to get their water bottles mixed up .
i didn't want him to die out there .
i just didn't know what to do .
i only used enough to make him ...
i wasn't trying to hurt him .
are you gonna tell the others?
i don't see any reason why they need to know .
but sun ... ... he's going .
lf i were you , i'd ...
i'd say goodbye .
i'm back on the raft .
glad to hear it .
michael's gonna cowboy up .
we set sail tomorrow .
are you here to say sorry , sawyer?
sorry don't suit me .
you cornered me , freckles .
i did what i had to .
i cornered you?
you said if you wanted my spot , you were gonna take it .
guess i believed you .
well ... that's that .
i got some packing to do .
why is it so important for you to be on that raft?
'cause there ain't anything on this island worth staying for .
be safe , sawyer .
yeah .
dad?
hey , buddy !
you getting better?
yeah .
yep , i'm gonna be all right .
hey .
don't worry .
i'm gonna be on my feet soon and we'll be sailing home before you can even ...
i'm the one that burned the raft .
i didn't wanna leave , and i thought i could stop you .
i'm sorry .
i'm really sorry , dad .
hey , it's okay , man .
we can stay here .
you and me .
we don't have to go .
yes , we do .
hello .
hey !
jack knows .
i didn't tell him it was your idea .
thanks .
why should you be punished?
you were only trying to help me .
he said he wouldn't tell the others .
yeah .
jack's good at keeping secrets .
when i was a little girl ,
i believed that once i found the man i loved ... ... l would be happy ... ... forever .
yeah .
me too .
