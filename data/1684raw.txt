i'm sorry !
i'm sorry !
i'm sorry !
what do you want?
i don't know .
help !
help !
help !
help !
stop !
what?
what?
it's okay .
come here .
what was in there?
i have to figure things out .
how many people are in this thing?
why not?
holy cats .
holy , holy cats .
you alright?
mister?
worth !
don't worry .
i hit my head .
let me take a look at that .
i'm a doctor .
it doesn't look bad .
what the hell are you doing?
hey , did you hear what i said?
motion detectors .
into the walls .
tough to spot .
oh god , oh god , oh god .
wait a second .
let's all just relax for a minute .
perogies .
i was eating dinner .
i don't know .
you?
leaven?
i , i just went to bed and ...
what about you?
i just woke up here .
who?
then what is it?
i don't know .
aliens .
let's rule out aliens for now and concentrate on what we know .
my mom's gonna freak .
i won't be there .
she'll freak .
what do you think , rennes?
all right , i tend to agree .
shouldn't we wait here?
for what?
what about you?
look around .
take a look .
i got a feeling it's looking at us .
it's a nightmare .
leaven .
we can do this .
we've to be calm and work together .
you're a cop?
boot it !
clean .
it sounded closer .
it's mechanical .
it seems to come at regular intervals .
maybe it's the ventilation system .
no vents .
no kidding , i'm boiling .
what is it?
serial numbers?
room numbers .
they're different in each room .
they have to feed us , don't they??
holloway .
suck on it .
keeps the saliva flowing .
what?
the air seems dry in there .
why didn't the boot set it off?
the boot's not alive .
detects hydrogen sulphide of the skin .
renn .
not renz .
it's french .
fine , you're french .
how you ...
he's the wren .
you're kidding , right?
you don't have to think about nothing that's not in front of you .
merde .
get him out !
oh my god !
it was electro chemical .
and he missed it .
the wren .
great !!
we've to reassess this place .
forget about all that !
you can't have answers in here !
just look at what's in front of you .
that's what he said .
we all have a role here .
leaven , what are you?
nothing .
i just go to school .
what else?
there's nothing else .
i live with my parents .
i'm boring .
one down , four to go .
what's your purpose , worth?
often wondered that myself .
i can't stand that attitude .
because he's right .
what's your purpose , quentin?
kids , three of them .
i haven't made my peace yet .
nice , nice
i'm not giving up !
i'm pissed off .
they came into our homes !
they took my ring , they took ... ... oh , my amethyst .
i wanna know who's responsible .
your glasses?
you don't need them?
they're for reading .
what can they mean?
149 .
prime numbers .
i can't believe i didn't see it before .
see what?
645 , 645 ...
that's not prime .
372 ... no .
649 ...
that room is safe .
the incinerator room was prime 083 .
you remember all that in your head?
i have a facility for it .
leaven , you beautiful brain .
boot it .
okay , out of the way .
brains before beauty .
safe , safe .
prime numbers !
oh , how long have we been in here?
nine or ten hours .
how do you know?
five o'clock shadow .
last thing i remember was shaving .
you got a date .
doin 'good .
i need to smoke .
i'd smoke a butt off a sidewalk .
talk then .
have a conversation .
what kind of doctor are you anyway?
you know , the free kind .
she didn't either .
she's not dead , we're separated .
these numbers aren't prime .
okay , clear .
excuse me , sorry .
no , i couldn't .
this one's trapped too .
we have to backtrack?
not yet .
read them to me .
it's stuck .
look out .
this room is green .
holloway?
hi there .
this room is green .
yes , it is .
i wanna go back to the blue room .
what is it?
shock or what?
i think he's mentally handicapped .
i like the blue room .
jesus christ .
he almost broke my neck .
butter first , then honey , kazan .
how'd he survive?
i wanna go back to the blue room .
there's lots of blue rooms .
we'll find you another real soon .
this is too bizarre .
go on .
i'll look after him .
let's not make him do the climbing thing now .
holloway ...
hol lo way .
what are you talking about?
at least he's good for something .
free clinic doctors?
you know what the establishment is?
just guys like me .
they don't conspire , they buy boats
this place is .. remember scaramanga?
it's a rich psycho's entertainment .
is that what you think?
clear .
gas !
holloway , get back here !
it's ok .
i just swallowed my button .
i hate this .
i hate this .
it's like cramming without coffee .
she needs a break .
she can do it .
they don't look like prime to me .
is that your two bits worth , worth?
for what it's worth .
well?
well , he's right .
not prime .
stop !
in front of you !
what is it?
shut up !
quentin , hold still .
leave the boots .
shut the fucking door !
how would he know?
so he has a bad attitude .
this makes a spy of him?
he doesn't like red rooms .
so what happened?
maybe they mean nothing at all .
well , we need to rest anyway .
are they telling you anything?
they're no tarots .
they don't reveal themselves at once .
they're like people .
oh , gross .
well , he's just peeing .
jesus christ .
now it totally reeks in here !
do you find this pretty funny?
what's your fucking problem , worth?
even holloway is better than you .
jawohl , kommandant .
and that somebody has to be you .
not all of us can play nihilist .
not all of us like to play hero .
this is a will to live .
a will to live .
the warm feeling deep inside .
thanks .
i'm a new man .
poor worth .
nobody loves me .
do it .
thought so .
fuck you quentin !
you think we matter?
we don't .
you're not getting out of here !
yes , we are !
no , you're not !
yes , we are !
there is no way out of here !
gotchya .
how do you know that?
answer the question , worth .
oh , god .
who are you?
i'm the poison .
the shell .
the sarcophagus .
you built this thing?
i was contracted to draw plans for a hollow shell .
a cube .
a cube?
why didn't you tell us?
worth .
you're lying .
was not at first .
who's behind it?
i don't know .
who hired you?
i didn't ask .
i never left my office .
bullshit .
you knew from square one .
no .
that's the way things work .
one doesn't know what the other does .
the brain never comes out in the open .
whose brain?
it's the same machine !
you do a little job in your office ,
i was right .
all my life .
we gotta get out to tell the truth !
holloway , you don't get it .
big brother is not watching you .
what kind of fuckin 'explanation is that?
we have no idea what it is .
we know more than anybody else .
nobody wants to ask questions .
i worked for months on this .
it was a great job !
why put people in it?
because it's here .
you have to use it or you admit it's pointless .
but it is pointless .
quentin .
that's my point .
what have we come to?
it's so much worse than i thought .
not really .
just more pathetic .
you make me sick , worth .
i make me sick too .
we're both part of the system .
it's like you said , quentin .
let's face it , the reason we're here is that it's out of control .
this is how we ruin the world?
well , i feel better .
that's why you stayed with us .
to confess .
quentin !
stop it !
stop it !
we need him .
what for?
have you gone mad?
worth .
hi .
so there's this outer shell .
yeah .
where?
wherever the door guy put it .
and it's sealed from the outside .
what are dimensions of the outer shell?
one hundred and thirty two square meters .
may i?
come on , honey , slide over .
5 by 5 by 5 meters .
the inner cube can't be flush with the shell wall , there's a space .
one cube?
i don't know , it makes sense .
the biggest the cube can be is ...
26 rooms high , 26 rooms across , so
17 . 576 rooms .
seventeen thousand , five hundred and seventy six rooms?
it makes me queasy .
descartes !
leaven , you are a genius .
what?
what?
coded cartesian co ordinates .
in english , slower .
these numbers are markers ,
like latitude and longitude on a map .
the numbers tell us where we are inside the cube .
well , where are we?
it works .
all i have to do is add the numbers together .
the x coordinates is 19 ...
y is 26 rooms ...
so that places us ... ... seven rooms from the edge .
all right , let's go .
holloway , i'm looking for solutions .
well , you haven't found any yet .
we cut the risk with the numbers and the boot .
worth will go first .
no , he won't !
we take turns !
relax .
room for two in there?
what's the matter?
these coordinates .
14 , 27 , 14 .
what about 'em?
they don't make sense .
if there are 26 rooms across , no coordinate can be larger than 26 .
no , not outside of the cube .
that means we're not having dinner .
trap .
trap .
trap .
trap .
trap !
trap !
sound activated .
lovely .
how come the sound of the door opening didn't set it off?
must be rigged to ignore it .
the edge is surrounded by traps .
i say we cross the bitch .
right !
how many boots do we have left?
get it off him .
we know how it works .
we just have to be quiet .
that's pretty fucking quiet .
i'm glad you're on side , worth , 'cause ... you're up .
he's unpredictable .
we'll come back for him .
but he's a risk for us .
am i right?
shame on you .
will you look at yourselves?
what have you turned into?
that's all we got left .
we'll come back for him .
that's a lie and you know it .
he'll be quiet .
no .
you go out , i'm here .
this way .
you fucking fuck !
let him go right now !
let him go , you nazi !
what did you call me?
quentin , let that innocent boy go .
you listen to me , woman .
you're always crying for something .
i know your type .
no kids , no man to fuck you .
so you go around outraged , sniffing their business !!!
you missed your boat , holloway .
you're all dried up inside there .
that's your fucking problem .
how dare you say that to her?
you don't know her , quentin .
none of us know each other here .
oh , i do .
no you don't .
no wonder your wife left you .
all that bottled up anger .
and a thing for young girls .
god help you , quentin .
did you smack your kids around too?
open it .
door number six?
net number one?
door number two?
open the fuckin 'thing .
oh , sunshine .
night time .
my old friend , the shell .
it's there .
morning !
hang on to me .
i can't see anything .
nothin 'to hang on to .
we gotta try something .
let's see if the door's over there .
someone has to swing over there .
swing?
we make a rope out of clothes .
i'll tie it around myself .
i'll go .
i'm going , holloway .
she's right , you're too heavy .
i'm the lightest after leaven .
anyway , it's my turn .
a couple of months .
i am .
david .
helen .
you're such a helen .
that's as far as you go .
there's nothing down here .
hold tight .
i try swinging over there .
okay , one more time .
hurry , you're getting heavy .
what the hell's going on?
get up here now !
quentin !
have you got her?
she ... slipped .
shhh ... come on .
kazan .
will you please stop doing that?
you got to be strong , sweetheart .
don't even talk to me .
we gotta get down to the bottom .
a long way with only one boot .
but we've to do it before we get too weak .
you gotta keep cracking the numbers .
it's your gift .
it's not a gift .
it's just a brain .
all right .
one hour .
an hour is as long as i say .
what are you doing?
we have to reach the bottom .
it's quiet there , you can concentrate .
you want to leave them?
they're traps , leaven .
believe in me !
try and see how my mind works .
i can read people like an x ray .
i looked through the walls .
i saw him working on this .
we're the purpose .
the cube ... ... is us .
we fit .
like numbers .
a man and a woman .
two halves of the equation .
i take you down , the perfect key .
i slip you into the lock .
leaven , it's time to go down .
get away from her .
they're fuckin 'spies .
holloway knew about my family ...
you dropped her .
just go , quentin .
give us the boot , you pig !
you don't want the boot .
you want to came with us , worth?
down the hatch .
what the fuck's with him?
how did ...
it's , it's , it's the wren .
it's the old wrenster .
how could ...
we've been going around in circles .
that can't be .
where are we?
i don't know !
where are we?
you figure it out !
guess you were right , worth .
there is no way out of here .
get away from me .
wasn't rennes killed in that room?
how come there's nothing out there?
it's the edge .
fuck off !
oh , that was good .
what difference does it make?
we're dead anyways .
of course .
the rooms?
it's the only logical explanation .
i'm such an idiot !
the numbers are markers , points on a map , right?
right .
permutations .
permu what?
a list of the coordinates that the room passes through .
the numbers tell you all that?
i don't know ,
all i saw was what the cube looked like before is started to move .
okay , so it's moving .
how do we get out?
27 .
i know where the exit is .
where?
you remember the room that had the coordinate larger than 26?
what about it?
that placed the room outside .
a bridge .
what are you talking about?
the room starts off as a bridge ,
so , when does it open?
don't .
that's it !
this room moves to zero , 1 and 1 on the x axis .
2 , 5 and 7 on y.
and 1 , and 1 and zero on z.
and what does that mean?
you suck at math?
i need the room numbers around us .
666 , 897 , 466 .
567 , 898 .
and 545 .
did you get that?
656 , 778 , 462 .
that's enough .
x is 17 .
y is 25 and z is 14 .
this room makes 2 more moves before returning to its original position .
do we have time?
maybe .
then let's go !
you threw out our last boot .
can you calculate that?
the numbers are huge .
i'd have to calculate the number of factors in each set .
maybe if i had a computer .
i'm not dying in a rat maze !
look at the numbers .
i can't factor them !
even 5 , 67 !
it's astronomical !
2 .
astronomical .
before that .
factor .
how many factors kazan?
of 5, 6, 7 .
2 .
what , are you fucking kidding?
how many factors does 30 have?
3 .
how about 7?
1 .
gum drop .
i don't have any gum drops .
gum drops .
gum drops come in bags .
ok in bags .
i don't like the red ones .
898 .
2 .
545 .
2 .
he's giving us the factors .
astronomical .
so this idiot would be a genius?
by those numbers it should be safe .
only one way to find out .
don't !
safe .
kazan , my man .
what's the number?
right here , look here !
make him do it !
kazan , we're gonna do some numbers .
prime numbers .
and the factor of 656?
2 .
779?
2 .
462?
3 .
clear .
move !
let's go .
you too , worth !
go !
worth !
563 !
please , kazan , 563?
you fuckers , you're dead !
2 .
clear !
1 .
trapped !
check the floor .
is he dead?
where is he?
come here .
i said come here now !!
gotchya .
that way .
2 .
clear !
4 .
clear !
that proves our theory .
numbers .
423 .
clear .
listen .
he hasn't moved far .
i'll go find him .
what do you think?
you don't have a lot of lives left .
i didn't move .
i don't like that .
14 , 26 , 14 .
worth , get back here right now !
deal .
this room's going to the bridge !
we're coming !
over here !
we don't have much time .
this better be it .
it should be .
where?
oh , no !
give me a minute .
be patient .
this is the room we started in .
the bridge .
red .
424 .
clear !
go ahead .
it's not your fault !
what is out there?
boundless human stupidity .
i can live with that .
get out through the door !
red , kazan !
a cube ... 26 rooms high .
26 rooms across .
17, 576 rooms? !
fear
do you remember how you got here?
paranola
i wanna wake up !
susplcion
motion detectors into the walls .
tough to spot .
desperatlon
we can't get out of here .
yes , we are !
there is no way out !
we need to get around the traps .
prime numbers identify them .
i'm not dying in a rat maze !
no more talking , no more guessing .
the walls
what the hell is going on?
are closlng in
we are the key ...
the cube ... ... is us .
