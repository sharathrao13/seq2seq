sebastian , sebastian , stop pouting .
sorry .
i'm such a dope .
you're not a dope .
you're just misguided .
sebastian would make an exceptional student if only he'd follow orders .
you fed the school hamster an overdose of viagra .
i was testing the reproductive system for an experiment to see how big
enough !
enough !
fortunately , you are moving to a new town .
you can start anew .
it's time to shape up .
speaking of shaping up , how's mrs. freeman doing?
she's lost some weight .
she looks good .
thank you .
it's a great thing she's doing for the community , censoring books and all .
catcher ln the rye screwed me up .
mrs. freeman knows what's best for young minds .
which comes to my point .
i was wondering what you planned to do with my file .
it's not very favourable and  and ... ... you'd prefer if i didn't forward it to your new school .
i've thought long and hard about it .
and i've decided to send it .
i mean , if you've really changed , you'll rise above your past mistakes .
how can i thank you?
you've got a plane to catch , and i've got some work to do , so ....
you just remember , sebastian ...
... the future is what you make of it .
the future is what i make of it .
the future is what i make of it .
got it .
i'll never forget you , sir .
yeah , yeah .
right .
right .
pansy .
ed freeman .
what the fuck have you done to me?
what's wrong , pumpkin?
have you seen me in the school yearbook?
yes , you look wonderful !
wonderful?
i'm naked , you fucking idiot !
fuck .
i'm a laughing stock !
how could you ... ...
iet this happen?
you weaselly piece of shit !
you'll pay for this !
ed , i hate you !
asshole !
sebastian !
sebastian !
sebastian !
don't think you'll get away with this , son .
so where you headed?
new york city .

yeah .
i'll take care of the driver .
your family's expecting you .
which apartment?
the whole building , sir .
of course .
what was i thinking?
oh , my god !
sebastian valmont to see you , sir .
good to see you again , son .
it's good to see you too , dad .
how's your mother?
doctor rappaport thinks she'll be in rehab for the long haul .
thanks for taking me in .
a foster home's not my thing .
think nothing of it .
you hit the mother lode this time .
sebastian , i would like you to meet the love of my life .
this is tiffany .
it's a pleasure to finally meet you .
i see you have your father's beautiful blue eyes .
thank you .
my , what a precious little kitty you have .
like to pet her?
some other time .
sebastian , come meet kathryn .
i've heard so much about you .
welcome to the family .
i always wanted a brother , but they were all sold out at bloomingdale's .
is that a steinway?
i won't play anything else .
may l?
be my guest .
kathryn is an exquisite pianist .
really?
cute .
it needs a tuning .
mother , sebastian must be famished .
shouldn't we check on dinner?
i think that's a wonderful idea .
i'm so excited you'll be starting manchester with me tomorrow .
it's a wonderful institution with wonderful teachers .
wonderful .
kathryn is president of the student body .
and president of the french club .
oui .
i live for extracurricular activities .
student president?
i thought you were a sophomore .
i am .
i believe one shouldn't be hampered in one's goals ... ... simply by the paltriness of one's years .
you mean " dearth .
excuse me?
paltriness " implies insignificance .
but it's lack of age that shouldn't hamper you from achieving your goals .
careful with those sat words .
they can be deadly .
thank you .
isn't kathryn just the best , son?
yeah , she's a real peach , dad .
i love you , stepdaddy .
i'm a little tired from travelling .
do you mind if i turn in?
not at all .
i know you have a big day ahead of you tomorrow .
i'll show you to your room .
you little asshole , what do you think you're doing?
what?
do you hear me?
do not fuck with
so he outdoes you at piano .
he outdoes you at vocabulary .
i guess i overestimated you .
and don't sulk .
it's a sign of weakness .
yes , mother .
everything's fine .
i was just checking up on you , mom .
look , i promised i'd take care of you , right?
i'll talk to dad and get you into a better facility .
it's the least he can do .
i love you too .
what?
let's get something straight !
i've got a great thing going with the rentals .
no curfew , not bothered about homework and a five figure allowance .
no one , and i mean no one , is about to threaten my cushy lifestyle .
especially not some two bit hick loser .
but  i don't want to hear it .
now , as for school , stay out of my face and we'll get along just fine .
but if you cross me once , i'll bury your sorry ass .
understood?
all right .
i'm glad we could have this little discussion .
not bad .
what's the matter?
this collar's too tight .
i guess you're only used to wearing mesh shirts where you come from .
more sat vocabulary builders?
for your information , this happens to be my orientation speech .
who are you orienting?
please , be more stupid .
i am the student body president .
ivy league schools eat extracurricular crap up .
you do know what an lvy league school is?
stop !
gordon anderson .
looking good .
do me a favour .
pretend you don't know me .
my god , you're beautiful .
excuse me?
i said you were beautiful .
thank you .
excuse me , but what did you mean by that remark?
what remark?
that i'm beautiful .
aren't you?
well , yeah .
no , no .
that's
never mind .
you're very strange .
i know .
are you here to see the headmaster?
yeah .
i heard he's a total joke .
i wouldn't know .
the headmaster will see you now .
in all my years of education i've never seen a file quite like this .
4 . 0 gpa .
president of several clubs .
all star snowboarding for your county .
and several glowing letters from your teachers and your former principal .
we were very close , he and i , sir .
yes , it's most impressive .
thank you .
perhaps ... ... a little too impressive .
thank you .
that aside , i'm sure an enterprising young man like yourself ... ... would be a welcome addition here at manchester .
thank you , sir .
come in .
you have a few grammaticals , but nothing reprehensible .
thank you , honey .
meet my daughter , danielle .
you're both in the same class .
you look familiar .
have we met?
no , i don't think so .
are you sure?
must've been someone else .
i'd better get going .
it was nice meeting you , sir .
ma'am .
good luck , sebastian .
thank you , sir .
he seems nice , don't you think?
we'll see .
hail to thee , o stars so bright
hail to thee , manchester
be seated .
we'll now hear from your new student body president ... ... kathryn merteuil .
fellow students , faculty ... ... administrators and custodians ... ... l would personally like to welcome each and every one of you ... ... to what i think will be manchester's proudest year .
she's such an inspiration .
i consider each and every one of you ... ... members of my manchester prep family .
with that said , i feel it is our responsibility ... ... to reach out and accept all new students ... ... as members of ....
and accept all new students as ....
settle down , people .
as i was saying ... ... l consider each and every one of you ... ... members of my manchester prep are you all right?
sorry .
happens when i get nervous .
guess i need a bubble gum fix .
keep going .
you're doing great .
thanks .
once again , as i was saying ... ... l consider each and every one of you ... ... members of my manchester prep family .
with that said , i feel it is our responsibility ... ... to reach out and accept all new students
somebody do something !
good going , danielle .
danielle !
danielle !
danielle !
bravo !
terrific .
right .
sparing me the cliff notes synopsis ... ... who can tell me what this means?
mr. winkler .
jekyil is a doctor who developed this potion that transformed him ... ... into edward hyde , his evil side .
my gosh ... ... did that answer suck !
come on , i know you've got it in you .
what themes ... ... can be discussed here?
ms. sherman .
i think he's talking about the duality of man .
man has both good and evil in him .
if man cannot suppress his evil instincts , he is inevitably doomed .
wrong !
care to elaborate?
nowhere in the novel does he mention good over evil .
just the opposite .
jekyil loved hyde so much that he protected him .
yes , so he wouldn't hurt people .
please !
he loved hurting people .
why does he kill himself?
where does it say that?
at the end .
utterson found his body .
utterson was idiotic .
your point's idiotic !
all right , all right , break it up , you two .
wow !
am i losing my mind , or did we witness an intellectual debate?
although i disagree with your conclusions , mr. valmont ... ... l appreciate your warped point of view .
as for you , ms. sherman ... ... l think you could be more tolerant of other people's opinions .
hey , fellas , welcome back .
hey , good to see you .
assistant headmaster muller !
assistant headmaster muller !
steve .
i told you not to call me by my first name .
we need to talk .
i'm a little busy right now .
stop that !
i said , we need to talk .
what is it?
do you see something wrong?
i have gym .
you know i loathe gym .
we merteuils don't perspire .
what is this " we merteuils "?
you're a student .
try acting like one .
excuse me?
look , rules are rules .
i'm sorry , but you're going to gym .
i understand .
you do?
yes .
but ... ... it's a bit strange , because isn't it against the rules ... ... for someone of your age to seduce a minor like you did to me this summer?
now you know that's not entirely true .
it was you who seduced me .
you know ... ... you're right .
it was me who seduced you .
but who will the school board believe?
it's my word against yours .
think about it .
this could ruin your career .
not to mention your marriage .
but i guess if you can bend the rules a little ... ... then so can l .
i'll see what i can do .
you're the best .
the manchester tribunal will come to order .
kathryn merteuil presiding .
thank you , blaine .
fellow students of affluence and popularity ... ... welcome to this year's first meeting of the tribunal .
as your new leader , i promise to do my best to weed out the geeks ... ... losers and underprivileged ... ... and toss their fat asses out of our school .
here's the shipment , mrs. gagin .
thank you .
could you reshelf these for me?
thanks .
oh , my god !
it's like a cartoon cock .
hi .
are you all right?
you scared me to death .
you dropped this .
i didn't drop it .
yes , you did .
but it's okay .
sexual curiosity's nothing to be ashamed of .
i'm not ashamed and i have a very healthy sexual curiosity .
really?
what are you doing here?
i work here .
could you take a break and join me for coffee?
i'd love to , but unfortunately i have a lot of work to do here .
mrs. gagin , do you mind if danielle joins me for a coffee break?
please , go right ahead .
there's nothing to do right now .
thank you .
you don't quit , do you?
what happened to " be nice to the new kid "?
1 5 minutes .
go !
next .
michael keen , freshman .
former bmoc of his junior high school .
don't let his acne dissuade you .
his dad runs the coliseum .
get him a facial and see if he'll score us tickets to the hole concert .
next .
sebastian valmont .
sophomore .
son of edward and corrine .
go on .
he's a transfer student .
i don't have more information on him .
don't you know anything?
he is your stepbrother .
i've only known him for a day .
he's a total loser .
i mean , he shops at the gap .
stay on him .
see what you can find .
will do .
next .
cherie clayman , freshman .
daughter of hubert and bunny .
annual family income ....
well?
850 million dollars .
she's richer than kathryn .
i heard that .
she has a gpa of 1 . 3 and not only is she a virgin , but ... ... she's never kissed a boy .
this girl is a walking teletubbie just begging to be made an example of .
i think i'll oversee this one personally .
when i get through with her , she'll be the premiere slut at manchester .
next order of business , grievances .
yes , lauren?
it appears we're having a bit of trouble with the new school chef .
mr. washington seems to think that sushi ... ... is an inappropriate meal for growing girls and boys .
all those in favour of sending him back to his hot dog stand , say " aye .
aye !
okay , bye bye , mr. washington .
hello , mr. yakamoto .
so , what's a nice girl like you doing at a snobbish school like manchester?
it's called free tuition .
besides , it's not as bad as it seems .
my dad took over a year after my mom passed away .
i'm sorry .
your turn .
okay .
folks split up 1 0 years ago .
mom has a drug problem .
everyone thought it'd be best if i moved in with my dad .
you get along with him?
i don't really know him .
he's on his fourth marriage .
to kathryn's mom?
yeah .
i know this is rude , but what's it like growing up with all that money?
i'll let you know .
i'm only one day into it .
sorry to disappoint you , but richie rich i'm not .
and i thought i was the only one at manchester .
you ever get the feeling you're being watched?
yours?
hers .
there you are , silly goose .
i've been looking for you .
hi , danielle .
how's the used book store?
don't let her get to you .
she doesn't .
maybe it makes me uncool , but i don't care what she thinks of me .
actually , i think that makes you very cool .
i better go before she makes me hitch a ride home .
thanks for coffee .
i'll call you .
you don't have my number .
don't underestimate me .
don't underestimate kathryn .
let's go !
see you .
bye .
nice first day , retard?
it was great .
this bitch got gum stuck in her hair .
touche .
hi !
cherie , it's kathryn from school .
no , i don't hate you .
i was just appointed your big sister .
can you come out tonight?
it's a school event .
great !
i'll pick you up at eight !
see you , sweetie .
she spit gum in your hair .
keep your friends close and your enemies closer .
come on , she's just a freshman .
pick on someone your own size .
like you?
in due time .
so , you have a thing for boring virgins .
she's a virgin , you know?
careful , kathryn .
i'm better at this than you .
you have a backbone .
don't push me .
any time you want to start a war .
i'll keep it under consideration .
1 5 .
yeah !
good evening , master sebastian .
how was your evening jaunt?
not bad at all .
where are the folks?
dinner with a sheik .
your meal is ready .
will you shower before or after dinner?
hadn't thought about it .
anything i can do to make your evening more relaxing , just let me know .
thanks , henry .
this way , sir .
make yourself comfortable .
gunther's prepared a sweetbread mousse .
it's like dinner at the addams family .
guys?
hello?
anyone?
is everything all right?
i think i'll get something later .
go out .
if you need the car , just let frederick know .
sure .
it's not like that at all .
of course i miss you .
you do?
we'll get together very soon .
i promise .
what are you wearing?
i have to go .
i didn't hear you knock .
i didn't .
that was my accountant .
wow !
you guys must have a really tight relationship .
now look , son , don't make me regret taking you in .
well , i see that old habits die hard .
or in your case , not at all .
i'm your father .
and i demand to be treated with some respect .
a man has needs

you're a real role model .
would you sit the fuck down?
thanks , morris .

court , i'd like you to meet cherie clayman .
how's it going , cherie?
excuse me .
let's adjourn to the ladies 'room .
i don't have to go .
i do .
what do you need my help for?
want some more?
no .
back in a flash .
how do you know he likes me?
i can see it in his eyes .
if you say so .
what do i do about it?
you'll have to let him fuck you .
i've never even been to first base .
we'll start with first base and move on .
okay .
okay .
ready?
ready .
that was easy .
try again .
this time i want you to close your eyes .
he'll stick his tongue in your mouth .
i want you to massage his tongue with yours , okay?

psycho stepsister "?
evening .
evening .
oh , she shot you down .
exactly the opposite .
so , what's on the agenda?
matinee of the lion king?
you really have it out for her , don't you?
it must burn your ass that with all your money and popularity ... ... she still won't have anything to do with you .
face it , kathryn , she's outclassed you .
how dare you talk to me like that , son of a bitch !
well , this has been fun .
unfortunately , i have work to do , and you have to go throw up .
after all , it was a very big salad you had for dinner .
were you spying on me?
oh , god , i ate a crouton !
we'll see who gets the last laugh , brother dear .
oh , no !
i'm sorry !
it's all my fault .
i wasn't thinking .
i'll get it .
i'll clean it up .
it's okay .
it's okay .
stop crying .
just don't tell anyone .
is this ben hur?
do they beat you here?
please don't tell anyone !
min lin , relax .
christ , it's like a fucking godzilla movie .

unbelievably hard .
it certainly is .
rock hard .

you guys sisters?
more like " kissing cousins .
slippery when wet .
so you're seeing danielle sherman .
who?
oh .
yeah .
yeah , trying to .
she's a sweet girl .
you guys would make a great couple .
just too bad you're gonna miss out on all the action .
what action?
come on , with the exception of danielle ... ... manchester prep's a virtual whorehouse .
as the school motto goes : " if you don't snort it , suck it .
careful .
he splurged .
but you don't have to worry .
you'll be dating the headmaster's daughter .
no .
guess not .

ring toss .

yes !
thanks for , you know , sharing .
here , sis .
i'll dry you off .
thanks .
shit !
breakfast was late , my skirt is mussed and i needed the car last night .
i'm sorry , it's just  no excuses !
just because my mother is out of town does not mean you can slack off .
each lapse , each oversight will be reported .
good , you haven't left .
what's this , saddam addressing the troops?
allow me , sir .
it's all right , henry .
pay close attention .
the perfect windsor is an art .
rough night last night?
there was a pea under my mattress .
i'll look into it .

can we go now , or do we send kapur in our place?
i almost forgot .
here are your allowances .
what's this , annual?
semiannual?
weekly , of course .
this is amazing .
it's the leftovers , sir .
it's what i like to call " mad money .
yeah .

unless you use it to make someone happy .
for the windsor and the advice .
thank you , sir .
thank you very much .
you're very kind .
tutor me in french?

but it goes in one hole and out the other .
well , i wish i could help you .

mom said i can pay you , unless that's totally insulting .
we have money .
you're the headmaster's daughter ... ... and headmasters make zilch .
thanks .
tutor me , please?
i'll pay you $200 an hour . $200 !
stop !
i'll tutor you .
the money doesn't matter .
going rate will be fine .
why does everything have to be about money?
because it's cool .
do you hear a phone?
yeah .
oh , wait .
looks like it's coming from here .
i don't have a phone .
you do now .
answer me . " it's so cool !
ls it your birthday or something?
hello?
you like the phone?
i might , if it comes with an explanation .
it does , actually .
i think i may have real feelings for you .
it's sebastian valmont .
just a second .
sorry?
not you .
her .
who's her?
i can't do this from a phone .
but it's a good phone .
digital .
where are you?
you can't be too far .
look down .
oh , it is sebastian valmont !
don't move .
i'm coming down there .
move , einstein .
where are you?
close your eyes .
why?
just trust me .
i'll look silly .
close them now .
danielle , wait !
it's like they say , the best laid plans ... ... sometimes suck .
miss merteuil .
but i'm excused from gym .
gym , yes .
ballet , no .
there must be something i can do to change your mind .
i think you've got the wrong guy .
now , get your ass to ballet .
mr. erwick .
if it was to continue between us , you had to keep me out of gym and ballet .
i can't do anything , all right?
hargrove called me into his office .
he's suspicious .
and why do you think that is?
well , i'm not sure .
the disciplinary committee , of course .
you stammered like a whipped fool .
it was obvious you voted the way i wanted you to .
but that's how you did want me to vote .
oh , my god , i'm a mess .
you're always one step ahead of me .
i don't know what to do .
it's a dirty old man's catch 22 .
shut up , steve .
get control of yourself .
i can't !
i'm falling apart .
my wife doesn't turn me on anymore .
my kids hate me .
i should just quit .
stop blubbering .
i'll go back to gym and ballet .
you will?
the excuse slips were just a test .
a day will come when i'll need you for a favor , a big favor .
and you'll do it without question .
capiche?
of course .
i worship you , kathryn .
worship works best on your knees .
oh , kathryn .
be quiet .
i'm trying to imagine i'm with someone attractive .
sorry .
hello !
anybody?
oh , my god , she is terrible !
if it's so bad , why don't you guys just quit?
it's steady employment , sir .
it's a good address .
we could be down in the 50s .
or worse .
scarsdale .
ladies there make me crazy !
all the time sending me to the market , looking for gefilte .
my father , fisherman for 20 years .
he never caught one gefilte .
what is a gefilte?
three kings .
man !
beats my two pairs .
i got crap .
full house , jacks over threes .
you win again , master sebastian .
i really wish you'd quit with the " master " thing .
but , sir , it's your title .
it shows privilege .
what has it gotten me?
i bought gifts but didn't get the girl .
danielle hates my wealth or resents it or something .
perhaps it's not my place to speak .
please .
i'm desperate here .
she doesn't want to feel like she's being bought .
is that it?
i don't know .
women are complicated creatures .
it's been my experience that women are more interested ... ... in the soul of a man than in his trappings .
what is going on around here?
i had to ring and ring .
and where were you , frederick?
i paged you four times .
i had to take a cab .
a cab !
i'm sorry .
we were
get out of here , all of you .
you can be sure my mother will hear about this .
no , she won't .
what did you say?
you're not telling anybody about this .
i ordered them to play cards .
and to drink mother's prized 1 939 neuf du pape?
great year .
blitzkrieg , wasn't it?
don't get smart .
whether you realize it or not , you're still a guest here .
you treat them like dirt .
no wonder they don't respect you .
we pay them for service , not respect .
maybe someday you'll learn that .
and one day you'll realize that they're human beings .
just give me a second .
party's over .
you know , i don't get it .
if you hate your mother so much ... ... why work so hard to be just like her?
is that what you think?
you're obviously trying to prove something to someone .
no one's this mean , unless ... ... there's pain and suffering behind it .
you think it's tough having to come to this house with strange people?
try growing up here .
try spending every moment of your life just making up for just being here .
that doesn't make any sense .
no , it doesn't .
you feel out of place , sebastian?
you want to fit in?
guess what?
so do l .
what a mess .
hello?
sebastian?
it's cherie .
danielle is totally , madly in love with you .
madly in love?
she hates me .
every move i make is the wrong move .
but she told me stuff .
every time she thinks about you and sees you , she gets all moist .
moist?
her eyes .
she gets tears in them .
but time's running out .
you gotta move now .
she'll be in the city .
dinner with her aunt at the riverside cafe .
i figure if you go there , bare your soul ....
no gifts , though .
she hates that money thing .
hello?
closet street performer .
now you know all my secrets .
how'd you know i was here?
nope .
already know .
cherie the blabbermouth .
weird girl , but beyond the " totallys " and " oh , my gods , " there's truth there .
i have to catch my train .
i'll make sure you get home all right .
you can come to the station , only if you do it without talking .
not another word .
that's my condition .
condition accepted .
all right .
stop !
i give up , okay?
we can talk .
stop playing that thing .
you know , i think this is the most romantic city on earth .
millions of strangers meeting in restaurants , parks , sidewalks .
a romance born every five seconds .
every heartbeat .
god , is this a great city or what? !
this is exactly what i'm talking about .
you spout b. s. on a continuous basis .
i can't say what i really want to .
say it !
okay .
i want to know what happened at school , in the courtyard .
i kissed you and you just ran off .
i'm crazy about you .
i'm trying all i can to make you like me .
be yourself .
be honest .
why is that so difficult?
i don't know .
maybe i'm scared .
you know , i'm new here , right?
new to this city ... ... new at school ... ... living in a house full of certifiable wackos .
i don't have any friends .
at least any i can trust .
and i'm confused .
god's honest truth , i'm in a state of perpetual confusion .
what are you scared of?
missing my train .
see you at school .
bye .
as you know , your mother gets home tonight .
and you want me to keep quiet about the poker game .
i don't like the ideas sebastian's putting in your head .
i mean no disrespect .
well , i'm offended .
leave .
i'll finish alone .
min lin , wait .
let's get to know each other like you did with sebastian .
do i have to?
come on , it'll be fun .
here .
i'll jump right in .
where are you from?
china?
japan?
cambodia , actually .
cambodia , wonderful country .
when did you come to our united states?
my family fled through vietnam .
ultimately , we were 1 20 crammed into a boat the size of your pantry .
that reminds me of a time in denver .
we were coming home from aspen .
first class was packed .
we almost had to fly coach .
anyway , so your family fled the khmer rouge?
nothing subtle about that shade of rouge .
see , we do have a lot in common .
will there be anything else?
no , that's all .
i'm glad we did this , aren't you?
oh , yes .
very enlightening .
bitch .
you got all your pronouns mixed up .
nous is " we , " vous is " you .
unless it's someone you're crazy , madly in love with .
in which case it's tu , as in you and sebastian .
that thing with the phone , so cool .
if it had been me , i would've piddled right there .
did i show you my doodle?
excuse me?
my doodle , my sketch .
you've got some talent , cherie .
just tell me , do you really like him?
ls it the real thing?
like i even know what that is .
knees go weak , mouth goes dry ... ... you get that tingling feeling in that special place .
he's just so slick , so sure of himself .
i have trouble trusting him .
he can't just talk to me , say what he's really feeling .
neither can l .
okay .
chapter three .
read the translation of the first passage .
love is the sublime melting pot in which ... ... man and woman are fused together .
the lover is a priest ... ... the ravished virgin , a trembling sacrifice .
a priest and a virgin?
oh , that's sick !
move .
move .
move .
hi , mr. nago .
hello , ladies .
i make a special eel and cuke roll today .
it's so sad about mr. washington .
the fact that they found a dead rat in that student's sloppy joe .
he'll never work again .
you never told us how it went with cherie .
did you bury her?
let's just say she's on her way to ruin .
everything's set for this weekend .
what are you talking about?
i told my mom how much fun we had , and she invited you and your mom over .
your mom told my mom you can sleep over .
i got the new hanson album !
i gotta go .
gordon anderson promised to show me his one eyed snake .
whatever that is .
okay , see you .
maria , hola .
ay , caramba !
wow , kathryn , you really showed her .
don't talk .
don't say a word .
it's my turn to explain .
all i've done is hound you about being honest ... ... when i couldn't do it myself .
that kiss in the courtyard , sebastian ... ... it was more than just a kiss .
i'll say .
let me finish .
you see ... ... it was my first kiss .
i wanted it to be perfect and with the right boy .
while you might be the right boy , the rest was not right .
god , i embarrassed you .
i embarrassed myself .
i know you're used to girls with experience ... ... and you've been kissing girls forever .
that's what i was afraid to say .
i happen to think this is wonderful .
so you weren't exactly up front and honest .
join the club .
i wanted it to be perfect ... ... not the tail end of some prank .
does that make any sense?
yeah .
you know , some things can't be orchestrated .
some things have to be spontaneous .
like a kiss .
like the kiss we're about to have right now .
say something .
quick .
i can't .
i have to go .
last bell .
okay , but ... ... just back away so i know you're not running away .
that was wonderful .
just precious .
how long were you there? " i've never kissed a boy before , the right boy ... ... and you've probably been kissing girls forever .
you must feel like a terrible dope , leading on that lovesick girl .
what are you talking about?
here's a prediction .
a few weeks of hand holding and smooching ... ... and you'll be so horny you'll mess it up .
i could wipe her off the map tomorrow ... ... but i think i'll let this romance flicker out on its own .
i like her .
do anything to screw it up , and i'll screw you up .
nobody ever threatens me .
i just did , or weren't you listening?
you do realize this means war .
then war it is .
lovely .
i feel badly for you ... ... but byron needs to be groomed every day at 3 .
just reschedule your daughter's birthday .
i want him saddled and ready to ride when i arrive .
don't make me wait .
idiot .
there's a new student , cherie clayman .
did she die?
i take it you don't like her .
i can't stand her .
she's actually very sweet , so i'm turning her into the school slut .
she's now your new best friend .
why?
don't tell me you're hitting up the claymans for a donation .
sorry , mother .
i think it's an excellent idea .
the claymans will be joining us at 7 .
you invited them here?
mother , they're from california .
kathryn , i need this .
20 million more and we can break ground on the tiffany merteuil library .
well , you ladies seem to be enjoying yourselves .
you must be tense , sebastian .
you'd be too if you were failing gym .
who ever heard of fencing as a sport?
perhaps a massage would help .
i've never had a massage before .
you can have my table .
i'm suddenly not in the mood .
tack sa myckesh .
mycket , " not " myckesh .
if you don't say it correctly , don't say it at all .
it just makes you look foolish .
thank you for the correction , mother .
if you'll excuse me .
i think i could get used to this .
dead puppies , dead puppies , dead puppies .
old nuns in their underwear .
i thought you'd left .
is that sonia or lngrid?
it's tiffany .
i hope you enjoyed your massage .
i think i'll go take a shower .
we've had so little time together , sebastian .
can't be a happy family if we don't get to know each other better .
you're right , " mom .
we should talk more , mom .
with your father working on the yacht so much , i have time .
some nights , he doesn't even come home .
he loves that yacht .
i'm glad he found something he's so committed to .
the right woman will do that .
you think i'm the right woman?
definitely .
he's a changed man .
of course he's changed .
without me , he'd still be giving charters to geriatrics .
it's not the money , it's you .
he loves you .
you're a smart boy .
you seem to understand your father very well .
i hope so .
so do l .
because if you're wrong , you'll both end up on the street .
she spanked me .
oh , baby , that feels so good !
you like that?
dad , you here?
fuck !
fuck !
hey , son , how's it going?
in bed already?
just a catnap .
what are you doing?
i'm just looking for the cat .
here , puss , puss , puss .
i hope you're not suggesting i'm having an affair .
i'm not suggesting anything .
i'm your father and i will not be treated like a criminal !
a criminal?
you could've fooled me .
and behind door number three we have ....
hello .
sebastian , i'd like you to meet lilly ... ... my first mate .
lilly , i'm sebastian , edward's son .
oh , my god , you have your father's eyes .
are you a libra?
let's just cut right to the chase .
he offered to sail you around the world , didn't he?
how'd you know?
leave right now , or you're grounded for a week .
did he tell you he was married?
i was waiting for the right time .
you lied to me?
more an error of omission .
you see , she's very sick .
i may be single any day now .
go to hell !
sebastian , you think you could help me out here?
okay , okay .
i know we talked about this .
but you're a man and you have to understand
no , you have to understand .
it's not just your life , it's mine too .
don't screw it up for me .
absolutely .
you can count on me , son .
the keys , please?
you know , you made your bed .
now lie in it .
well ... ... this sucks .
i can't believe i was so stupid .
i really thought your dad liked me .
it's not your fault .
he's the master of deceit .
he should be in the liars 'hall of fame .
he was in the hall of fame?
never mind .
can i ask you something?
why are men such jerks?
is it genetic or something?
they promise you the world , that you're the one for them ... ... and that their wives don't understand them anymore .
and i fall for it every time !
i'm like a doormat !
they're always coming and going and coming and going and coming ....
my life sucks .
lilly , you don't need a man to be happy .
if you're not happy alone , you won't be happy with someone else .
you're an attractive woman .
you can have anyone you want .
you just have to wait for the right guy to come along .
you think i'm attractive?
i think you're beautiful .
you're so sincere .
you're not like your father at all .
glad you were paying attention .
want to come back to my place?
i'd love to , but i have an oral report due in the morning .
i'm great at orals .
try me .
no , thank you .
i'm gonna split .
will you be okay?
i'll be fine .
psycho .
i lived in fresno my whole life .
les too .
but we wanted more for cherie .
when les sold the biz , we moved to the big apple .
and how are you finding manchester?
it's no problem .
our driver , he takes me right there .
she's asking you if you like it .
oh , yeah , it's the best .
and kathryn's been so super nice .
they told me to stay away from her ... ... like she had permanent pms or something .
gross !
but she's been totally awesome .
she'll be very popular .
not as popular as you .
popular is such a bore .
school spirit is important ... ... and nobody has as much as my mother .
i do some work for the fundraising committee .
you are so modest .
mother's already raised half the money needed for the new library .
how much have you raised?
she barely does anything .
the parents practically throw it at her .
why do they throw money at you?
because charity is smiled upon by the ladies who lunch .
society , cherie .
you know , the social ladder .
my mom said now that we're rich , we gotta start climbing that thing .
what?
isn't she precious?
will you excuse me?
certainly .
pardon me .
so , how much money do you need?
i didn't invite you over here to discuss fundraising , bunny .
but if you'd make a donation , we'd certainly consider it .
really?
why , thank you .
my pleasure .
hi , honey .
how was your day?
i can explain this .
there's no need to explain .
i know you love my mother very much .
yes , exactly .
and sebastian and i are just getting close .
i know you'd never do anything to break up our happy home .
no , never .
so let's make sure it stays happy .
i want you to take mother to au troquet for dinner tomorrow at 8 .
an accordion player will pass your table .
request " under my thumb " by the rolling stones .
mick jagger makes her hot .
got it .
while she's listening , slip this on her finger ... ... then kiss her .
eight seconds , no tongue .
you getting this?
after dinner , grappa , one glass .
bring her home , make love to her .
two viagra .
any questions?
just in case , i've written it down for you .
who's your favourite daughter?
you are?
what a shame .
morning !
great day , isn't it?
bite me , rich boy !
new york .
what a wonderful town .
you look fabulous .
thank you .
you got everything?
you all set?
you better take some money just in case you need a cab , miss the train .
don't worry .
i'll be fine .
come on , this is my job to worry .
you know?
what's wrong?
nothing .
i just thought about your mom .
go on , have a good time .
okay .
bye .
sebastian thought you'd like it better than the train .
i am so excited !
but i'm nervous .
i've never been on a horse .
don't worry .
i won't let anything bad happen to you .
if i like it , dad will buy me a horse .
we can spend every weekend together .
you'll love it .
i promise .
very good , cherie .
back on the horse .
i think we're ready to try advanced jumping .
i don't know .
he keeps throwing me off .
all right , if you're going to be a scaredy cat ... ... l guess we'd better go back to the basics .
manuela !
nice horsey .
using the stirrups , i want you to push up and down in the saddle .
that's called " posting .
now add the back and forth motion .
when you hit the saddle , push backward , then forward .
up and down , back and forth .
faster , faster .
up and down , back and forth .
faster , faster .
good .
this time i want you to really grind into the saddle .
how does that feel?
i think i'm getting it .
posting is fun .
faster .
faster .
faster .
really fun !
are you okay?
i've never felt better .
now i know why girls like horses .
wait .
i don't know if i'm ready for this .
it's cool .
i'm sorry .
it's just that yesterday was my first kiss .
and now you're practically touching my breast .
at this rate , your dick will be in my mouth by lunch .
anyone for lunch?
i'm kidding .
listen , we can take this as slow as you want .
i like you .
i have no need to rush things .
that's not my problem .
i want to rush things .
i'm tired of being the only virgin in the sophomore class .
are you telling me that everyone in the sophomore class has done it?
well , it sure feels like it .
i don't know .
ever feel like you're at war with yourself?
constantly .
one side of me wants you to throw me down ... ... right here and rip my clothes off .
and then another side of me thinks ... ... l should wait till i'm married .
which side should i choose?
you really want me to answer that?
come on , be my friend .
listen , danielle , i know exactly what you're going through .
we have two sides .
i struggle with my dark side every day .
but that was the old me .
believe it or not , i have you to thank for it .
you showed me that it was okay to be a decent person .
how dark was your past?
pitch black .
i'm thinking ....
i think i'm falling in love with you .
but i'm afraid to take the chance to get hurt .
i'm afraid of getting hurt too .
listen , let's make a pact .
we'll take it slow and we won't hurt each other .
god , we sound like a cancelled television series .
you don't have to do this .
i want to .
hello?
hi , daddy .
yeah , i know .
i'm running late .
tell aunt gloria we can still make the 2 : 00 mass .
i'll call you when i get there .
i love you too .
you gotta go?
sorry .
it's okay .
call me later?
toodles .
bye bye .
oh , my balls !
here's something you might like .
dolce .
how '98 of you .
carry any real fur?
no .
all of our fur is faux .
of course , the animals .
how silly of me .
i figured you'd be here .
what's up?
it's about sebastian .
give me the dirt .
he has quite a checkered past .
he was able to pay off that overnight delivery guy ... ... and switch his school file .
that's impressive by my standards .
that's the tip of the iceberg .
well done .
cash or charge?
be there in an hour .
the new van der beek film's playing in town .
you sure your dad won't mind?
no , he's out of town .
it's just me and mr. whiskers .
mr. whiskers?
my pussy , silly .
okay .
i'll see you soon .
all right , bye .
the virgin's alone with her pussy , and i'm taking her to see dawson .
god , i've become a total fag .
i guess i misjudged you .
what are you talking about?
how'd you get this?
i have my ways .
kathryn , i'm trying to start over  blah , blah , blah .
please .
spare me any sob stories .
oh , dear .
something like this could destroy your clean reputation at manchester .
and that psychologist's report about your mom .
how will she pay for rehab when i tell mommy where her money's going?
you're playing with fire .
poor sebastian's mom will be homeless .
eating leftovers out of the garbage .
you don't know what i'm capable of .
yes , i do .
i read your file .
it turns me on .
fuck off .
going to see danielle?
leave her out of it .
looks like we've hit a sensitive spot .
do you really think you can change , sebastian?
face it .
you and i are two of a kind .
we're just not cut out for good deeds .
i know the drill .
you'll date danielle .
probably sleep with her after what , you think eight months?
and then you'll get bored , and you'll break her heart .
why don't you just spare her the pain?
and do what , date you?
we could make a good team .
what do you plan on doing with my file?
do i sense a merger in the air?
perhaps .
you do realize you're my stepsister .
you know what they say about incest .
is there any line you won't cross?
only one .
never in the butt .
that's a good line .
the bradys never had it so good .
i can't do this .
not with your pants on .
i gotta go .
you fucking pussy .
i gotta get out of this house .
is this about danielle?
you don't understand .
i love her .
you have a funny way of showing it .
i won't let you corrupt me .
don't you see?
you can't change .
i can try .
you're gonna die trying .
hello?
hello , danielle .
danielle?
danielle !
sebastian , you're soaking .
we have to talk .
come inside before you give yourself pneumonia .
thanks .
what's wrong?
i don't know .
it's okay .
you can talk to me .
go slow .
i feel like i'm losing it .
i gotta get out of new york .
it's kathryn , isn't it?
i don't think i can beat her .
sebastian , do you believe in a higher power?
do you believe love conquers all?
yes .
do you believe in our love?
it's all that's keeping me together .
so you believe in our love?
yes , i believe in our love .
because i sure as hell don't .
what?
fucking idiot .
bravo .
i told you i could do it .
never doubted you .
don't tell me you bought that virgin bullshit?
no , i saw you .
you were with your dad .
what he doesn't know can't hurt him .
i'm the headmaster's daughter .
daddy's little angel must keep up appearances .
holy fuck !
oh , don't be such a baby .
you didn't really think you'd win?
you're welcome to join us .
you know what they say .
two's company .
three's a fuckload of fun .
if you can't beat them ....
who says you can't beat them?
share and share alike .
sebastian , now you'll have something to write about .
danielle .
oh , shit !
are you okay?
i'm fine .
you really should try to be more careful .
thank you .
my bike !
could we offer you a ride?
sorry , my mom said i'm not allowed to take rides from strangers .
it's you !
i was just going to danielle's house .
i'll take care of the bike .
oh , my god , thank you .
i owe you huge .
no problem .
it's debbie , right?
no , cherie .
whatever .
has anyone told you you could be a model?
really?
too bad you're not sexy .
bull !
i can be sexy .
all right , show me sexy .
that's my special place !
holy shit !
