get up , bastard !
the boss , teacher ... and father are one .
written and directed by yun je gyun
dusabu ilche my boss my hero
myeogdong is the bridgehead to gangnam !
though du shik has taken over myeogdong .
the area is too important for him
to be in charge !
i agree , boss !
these days , younger brothers have all graduated from high school and a lot of them went to college .
du shik didn't even finish high school !
please reconsider , boss !
good work in myeongdong yesterday .
i owe everything to you , big brother .
you know how to be modest .
you've matured .
byeong hun , that son of a bitch .
what a fool .
a mere subordinate and he dares to betray the family?
hopeless bastard ...
have another drink .
thank you , big brother .
hey , du shik !
do you have e mail?
shit ... you take me for a fool?
what's your e mail address?
1 10 21 1 seoul , jung gu , myeongdong , 844 eco villa ...
apt .
303 .
what are you doing?
i'm setting up a cafe on the net .
cafe?
a fucking cafe?
you can't make money off that shit !
big brother told us ... not to do anything that makes no money , dumbass !
hey , head !
what?
i'm only telling the truth !
do you know what the internet is?
you think i'm stupid?
do you e mail?
i fucking mail this shit everyday !
i can mail this shit 12 times a day !
12 times , moron !
whatever .
that's what happened?
didn't the boss of the jongro family go to college?
it seems people who went to college always think that they're better !
i've never said that .
bull shit !
you were saying internet this , e mail that , cafe this and that , you liar !
big brother , do you know what a net cafe is?
is it in our district?
you're really ignorant , big brother !
he said , " is it in our district?
why is head always like that?
that sort of thing is unimaginable in las vegas .
you've been to las vegas?
you have no common sense , moron !
you have to have common sense , punk !
write your name .
seriously , big brother .
in chinese characters .
i'll leave myeondong open till the end of the year , just get your high school diploma .
then , if anyone has any problems with that , i'll take care of it .
do you understand?
yeah ...
big brother .
the cops are all over the myeongdong incident .
head , you must run the business and take care of our family in the boss's absence .
where are you going , big brother?
big brother will be gone for a while
big brother !
you can't go to prison !
i'll go in your place !
we should be going .
i'll go instead .
really , big brother .
thanks .
big brother ...
instead of school , how about a private learning institute?
private institute?
my cousin goes to one ... in noryangjin .
that's where the best institutes are .
they have great teachers and high college acceptance rates !
really?
but ...
do institutes give out diplomas?
if you give them money .
oh !
the world has become a better place to live !
let's have a round of applause for our improved educational system !
come on , come on , come on !
so , the first half should be focused on korean , math and english , and the second half on the overall general curriculum for the final spurt !
that's it !
spurt !
spurt is important !
but ... what's a general curriculum?
i lowered your age .
born in 1981 , 20 years old .
20 years old?
people often say that you look like you're in your early twenties .
i do look young for my age .
it would be difficult to enter public schools , so i looked into private ones .
i found a private school with a good reputation and competent teachers .
really?
sangchun high school in gangnam .
sangchun?
you've been admitted by way of contribution .
contribution?
what's that?
you give , and you take .
also , the important thing is ... it's co ed .
big brother !
i've looked into a great place , institutes with high rates in ...
noryangjin !
it's the best , big brother !
high rates and good teachers , and ...
general curriculum !
they give out diplomas !
and ...
how do i look?
something wrong?
nobody slicks their hair back in high school these days .
gye du shik enters high school

you're out of your league .
big brother !
i went to college .
damn ... motherfucker ...
you little retard ...
what are you doing?
well , this ...
what's this?
it's too small ...
i'm sure that you are all aware that our sangchun foundation also runs a general hospital among other things .
however , the urology department has been in deficit for some time .
so , we're going to encourage all students to receive circumcision .
is it free?
how would the foundation survive if it were free?
gye du shik !

what's with ji hye's math grades?
how is she going to get a scholarship with grades like this?
who's her math teacher?
mr. jo ...
christ ...
you know how hot tempered he can be ...
do you think that i don't have a temper?
that jerk is good for nothing .

if he can't collect money , the least he could do is cooperate in these affairs .
nothing nothing
something something
'what i'm telling is the truth '.
do you understand?
you !
come here !
oh , shit !
leave !
i said leave !
it wasn't me .
then who was it?
kim ji hye .
come here !
come here now !
fucking bitch ...

stand straight !
what did you just say?

how can i even come to school anymore , mom?
i was so embarrassed !

you might have passed the physical test if you weren't so weak .
you bitch !
how dare you ...

crazy bitch !
why did you hit my child?
how dare you , bitch !
i never even hit her !
who the hell do you think you are?

who the hell are you?
how's a child going to learn anything if the parent is this way !
students are hit only when they deserve it !
this is a school !
misbehave?
you think i'm the one who's misbehaving !
what mother would like to see her child
beat up like a dog !
nonsense , nonsense !
you're only a teacher !
don't stand up to a parent !
i'm sorry .
you're sorry?
do you know who she is?
do you know who her husband is?
what are you staring for !
jerk ...
you want to be fired?
you think i won't do it?
get out of my sight !
you're just a pathetic teacher , cocky bastard !
what do you think you're doing !
what on earth is this place !
is this a school?
no matter how rotten education may have become , how can a parent come in an uproar and rage violence against a teacher !
how can teachers ever teach if we're scared of what parents might think !
who was that?
yang gyeong jik , up front !
right now !
you think it's funny?
no , it's not that ...
it's not what?
tarzan over there ...
you want to play jokes , huh?
you think that's funny?

you little brats !
you have no fucking manners !
how dare you defy a teacher !
if i catch any one of you disrespecting a teacher ,
i'll slice you up real good ... with a kitchen knife !
do you fucking get me?
you little brat !
what did you say about a kitchen knife?
'do you always get off this late? '
'get off this late? '
'go home this late? ''get off ... '
'go home ...? '
excuse me ...
aren't you ms. lee?
what a coincidence ...
well ...
i'm thirsty .
sorry about earlier .
but you were wrong .
as an old proverb says that " students don't even step on a teacher's shadow .
have you heard of 'dusabu ilche '?
don't you mean 'gunsabu ilche '?
it means that the boss teacher and father are one !
understand?
they look like students but they're drinking alcohol .
that's unimaginable in las vegas .
you've been to las vegas?
wow , a big boat !
study when you can .
you'll know what i'm saying when you get older .
fuck !
then why don't i know?
that was a legitimate blow .
i think that he was slightly off .
pay back my money if you have money to spend on liquor , punk !
i told you that you'd be dead if i saw you , didn't i !
looks like they're gonna fight .
they don't know what they're getting into .
you little punk , i told you to stay home , bitch !
what do you think you're doing?
i'm so scared !
oh my god , i'm so scared !
who are you?
you with him?
you his friend?
i think it was legitimate this time .
he got him pretty good .
i told you to stay home !
stay home !
you !
come here .
yes , sir !
why?
you wanna fight me?
this is just like a movie .
i'm sure we'll soon be on our knees , begging you for your forgiveness .
you fight well?
come on !
go for it .
come on !
i'm bleeding !
son of a bitch !
so you like to sucker punch , huh?
fuck !
don't touch me !
stay back .
and don't touch me .
so you've learned how to fight , motherfucker?
get him !
looks like he's flying .
the technical term is 'action scene '.
action scene ...
little punks !
students should be studying , not fighting !
are you gangsters?
are you?
huh?
huh?
are you gansters?
want me to bring gangsters?
wanna fight gangsters?
one on one?
you wanna go one on one?
please .
what?
please forgive us .
what do you think they're saying?
do you want me to go ask?
why don't you understand?
you're killing me .
what's the big deal with changing one student's grades?
i've already told you .
if i change ji hye's grade ,
it won't be fair to the other hard working students !
the grades will not be changed !
look at this .
and you call yourself a homeroom teacher?
your class's grades are dead last .
you're too weak .
that's why ... students and parents ...
i'm going to leave , sir .
ms. lee !
you don't have a clue .
this country is filled with teachers !
do you understand what am i saying?
look into a new english teacher .
why can't women teachers last a year?
but ms. lee is a very competent ...
what happened with ji hye's grade?
he won't do it .
bastard .
yun ju , bong pal says to come .
i mean ...
mr. jo is calling for you .
you better study harder because you're skating on thin ice .
if you can't get a scholarship , who are you going to resent?
yun ju .
how many hours do you sleep these days?
6 hours ...
sleep less !
how does a senior expect to go to college ... on 6 hours of sleep a night !
if you play and sleep as others do , how are you going to get ahead?
do you understand me , yun ju?
this element consists of plutonium and alloy , so an easy way to remember is play .
play .
what did i just say?
you wanna play?
du shik .
yeah?
you like me , don't you?
if i marry you , will you send me to college?
i'm just kidding .
hey , du shik !
yeah?
buy me a drink .
students shouldn't drink ...
yun ju ...
yun ju !

don't worry .
it's okay for you to drink with a teacher .

translate it to korean .
oh?
when did you get circumcised !
what happened to your beads?
college boy ...
your pronunciation is so awful ...
if you keep seeing ms. lee , it'll complicate things , so forget her .
love knows no boundaries .
did you learn that in college?
big brother , it's not that ...
little bastard ...
get rid of your beads !
get rid of your beads , asshole !
'get rid of your beads , asshole ! '
did you have fun?

i'm not finished .
du shik .
your family is rich , right?

so i can go to college like everyone else .
i'll pay you back .
the girls here tell me ,
that a few months of hard work will pay well .
you don't want to lend me money?
wanna go to a motel?
but you know ...
i'm expensive 'cause i'm underage !
you need to get yourself together !
i need money to go to college !
i want to go to college ... and grad school ...
i want to study abroad ...
it must be nice to be rich , you jerk !
what?

i just want you to look into things .

that really happened?
you didn't know?
ms. lee was a victim !
you know her .

ms. lee .
are you serious?
what kind of motherfucker !
bastard , fucking bastard ...
ms. lee !
ms. lee !
head !
back to your position .
yes ...
hey , guys !
there is a big problem !
mr. jo ... is resigning !
who said that?
maybe you've heard wrong .
when it's an irrational expression in relation to variable x , then this function is called an irrational function .
mr. jo !
what?
is it true that ... you're resigning?
don't worry !
just worry about your studies .
... equals x ,
y equals x 1 +1 ...
sangchun foundation has relations with the myeongdong family .
what?
the principal , sang chun man runs a golf course , a shopping center ... they were recently taken over by the shin gang nam's gang .
go on .
byeong hun of the myeongdong family is working for the boss , shin .
that bastard?
i'm sorry .
i didn't know that .
fortunately , they don't know of your identity , so graduating won't be a problem .
shit ...
straighten your head !
how does the principal have a golf course , a villa and a mercedes benz?
can he afford all of that on his salary?
exactly .
yeong shik said he saw a secret book in his safe !
something's fishy !
i knew it .
hey , guys !
it's a big news !
'our school collects over several hundred dollars every month ... ''on the excuse of needing supplementary class , books and other things . '
'teachers are fired for refusing to follow improper rules ... '
yes .
yes .
please take care of this for me , just this once .
where has this been posted?
not only in the department of education's website , but the board of audit and inspection , and the president's homepage .
damn it !
who the hell is it !
by the looks of this , it doesn't seem like teacher ...
where's lee yun ju?
come here !
get up !
i said get up !
get up , bitch !
get up !
are you planning to destroy this school?
my loving students ...
please understand how hard it was for us to collect money when we knew how difficult it was for your families to just make ends meet .
imagine the inner conflict you feel when the principal tells you to raise a student's grade and in the end , you bury your true feeling as a teacher ... from fear of consequences .
bring back my friend , yun ju !
bring her back !
come out , sang chunman !
as teachers in the classroom , we teach knowledge but live a life ... in shame , because we did not fulfill our role as a teacher .
please have sympathy for us ...
until we meet again .
always be pure and bright , and study hard ,
who's going to take responsibility for students who are involved in this?
do you think those teachers are going to take responsibility?
you can't be serious !
are you really not coming out?
du shik , a lot of kids won't participate if you don't .
aren't you even angry?
you disappoint me .
yun ju is your friend !
retards ...
if i were you ...
let's just fucking go !
and you call yourself a man !
we're wasting time , come on !
dumb bitch , why does she even like such a selfish coward ...
god damn you !
i'm never ever gonna see you again !
never !
little brat !
where in hell do you think you are?
sangchun foundation has already influenced the politicians .
plus , the school didn't do anything illegal .
private schools have the right of appointive power of teachers .
if we step in , things could get really bloody .
that's why i need for you to find a way !
how can we just stand and watch?
this is a school , not a night club !
why are you risking the chance to graduate over such trivial matters?
you call this trivial?
the school fired teachers because they wouldn't take foul orders !
the school beat and expelled a girl who would do anything to go to school !
you're just gonna sit and watch?
tell me , moron !
you graduate in a few months .
when you do , all of myeongdong is ours !
you're being thoughtless because of your emotions !
please think of all of your younger brothers who depend only upon you .
that's correct , big brother .
i just did the calculations .
look at this .
i added up all the tuition and fees of every student , and it's only half of what our night club makes .
i think what sang du is saying is on the money .
what's on the money , moron !
stupid , dumb fuck !
be cool , big brother .
the boss shin's power is peaking , and his syndicate is all over the country .
please don't get yourself into this .
get out of here !
where do you think you are?
don't agitate the students and go home !
what kind of school is this?
what do you think you're doing?
haven't you disgraced this school enough !
are you out of your minds?
have you no conscience?
please get your head straight !
get them out of here !
bastard !
who the hell do you think you are?
cocky bastard !
fuck !
what are you doing !
go home .
go home .
go home !
you bitch !
what are you staring at , bitch !
sang du .
we're taking over sangchun high school .
du shik !
what?
who are these guys?
big brother !
are you okay , big brother?
do i look okay to you?
sang du ...
what the hell did he come here for?
leave this school , sangchun foundation !
leave this school , a corrupt foundation !
who are these clowns?
wow , bunch of men in black !
leave this school , sangchun foundation !
are you okay , big brother?
move , fast !
look at him .
does he look okay?
he's bleeding ...
shit !
i didn't get hit .
i was looking at the clouds , you know !
just clouds ...
motherfuckers ...
what ...
it's broken .
du shik?
you okay?
watch out !
shin gang nam , let's keep it simple and go one on one .
that was a legitimate blow .
he got him pretty good .
stand up !
ah , sorry !
does that hurt?
it kills ...
big brother !
get off me !
don't touch me ...
what's that?
that's called 'tag '.
tag ...
hey , come out .
yeah , you !
no weapons !
stop !
stop , asshole !
sang du !
are you okay?
it kills ... oh ...
what did i tell you , kid?
i told you , you're nothing without a stick ...
your turn .
what are you doing?
get out of my way !
this is unimaginable in las vegas .
bastard !
shit !
don't hit my head !
stand straight !
bend your neck !
you're all dead .
i passed the qualification examination for high school graduation .
you must've only studied in prison .
i owe everything to you , boss .
good work .
thank you , boss .
how is school?
i became class president .
congratulations , boss !
you know ...
i wanna put you in charge of gangnam , but many are objecting .
it's because of your academic background .
but i graduated high school .
most younger brothers in gangnam have been to college .
it's a cruel reality .
you're not possibly suggesting ... that i go to college , are you?
write it in english .
that's easy ...
did i tell you to write your name?
what?
then ...
'you're not possibly suggesting that i go to college , are you? '
du shik !
yes , boss ...
go to college !
