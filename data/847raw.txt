i'm doctor jeremy newman
i've been assigned your case
you were admitted last night
don't you remember?
that's okay
perfectly normal after that kind of trauma
what happened?
paramedics were called just after midnight
they found you , right in front of your house
you had violent choleric abdominal convulsions
i'm afraid we had to evacuate your stomach contents
and?
it's just , uh ...
i apologize ...
i've never had to tell a patient this before
we're a small hospital and painfully short staffed
i'm actually a pediatric doctor by training so any bad news i have to give usually involves a lollipop
would you like one?
it's grape
doctor , please
you died , mr. cable
your heart stopped beating for nearly two minutes
no , no , it's alright
we resuscitated you we brought you back
you're good as new well , practically
so , that's why i'm here
now , over the next few days , we'll ... run a series of tests to ...

my parents were catherine and leonard

jeremy , that's okay , nobody around here remembers it anyway
um , and the date?
it's the ...
uh , have i missed a day?

then it's uh ...
god , i've always been terrible with dates
well , that , that's okay don't worry about it

how about the year?
well , last year was 1999
so , this year is 2000

there's nothing to explain dr. newman
his synoptic cholinesterase is practically non existent
i really don't wanna be discussing this right now
what i need is coffee
poisonings have suspicious need you have to come report it to the police that's hospital policy
let's rule everything out first that's all i'm saying
diazepam , five milligrams
take it easy , mr. cable you're gonna be fine
just having a nightmare
let it go mr. cable
whatever it is you just have to let it go
so what we're looking at here is anterior grade amnesia
basically short term memory loss
nothing to get too worried about
nothing to get too worried about?
these episodes usually sort themselves out in a couple of days a couple of weeks
you're telling me that i've lost two years of my life?
think of it as if your life's a puzzle that's been jumbled up
all the pieces are still there
we just have to put them back together
fit them in the right order and place
and , honestly , simon i love a good puzzle
and i have a wife?
yeah , these situations are tough on couples
but your wife will help us with this
she could be the key
so , if you're feeling up to it
i'll go and get her
what do you think , simon?
would you like me to get your wife?
simon?
god !
simon i was so scared
i called every hospital i didn't sleep at all
give me a break now
the doctor says i'll be just fine
oh , my god what happened to you?
you have no idea how scared i was
for a moment i actually felt what it would be like if you weren't in my life i just completely lost it
you know it was kind of pathetic
what's the matter?
are you hurting?
dr. newman hasn't told you what's happened to me , has he?
now you're freaking me out , si
i've lost my memory
i can't remember anything about the past two years
i don't even know how i got here last night
and i don't know who you are
what are you doing , simon?
telling you the truth
i'm sorry
i don't know you , at all
you're serious?
with everything that's happened
this is how you're going to tell me?
wait a second i don't think you understand
are you crazy , simon?
i don't know what happened
i have nothing left
wait !
please !
anna !
anna !
whoa , mr cable whoa , stop
stop her !
stop who?
my wife !
there's no one here what are you talking about?
no aerobics for at least a week , simon
dr. newman , will you please stop my wife?
stop her?
she's not going anywhere
you have to tell her what's happened to me
i have , simon no , you haven't !
yes , he has simon
thank god , you're okay
the kids i work with can't get enough of these things
i love watching their eyes light up when they finally put it all together
it's just amazing
anyway , in order to recover what you've lost , simon
we need to find two points in time and join them
so , let's begin with the last memory you can recall two years ago
can you tell us what happened last night?
i wasn't with you last night
he has no memory of any of it
your role , anna will be to help him put his life back together
our life
it was our life of course
last night i was at home
you were up here i don't know what happened
peter
i must have been visiting peter peter?
peter is my brother he lives up here
he moved into our parent's estate after my mom died
we don't really get along , but ...
that's the only reason i'd be up here , right?
simon , honey peter's dead
what?
peter died before we met
there's no fucking way
i was going to see him just last night
you didn't see peter last night
he means his last night the last night he can remember
there was rain and this light
then everything 's quiet
no rain no light , just ...
oh , gosh , he's talking about the car accident
just this empty void
and i'm lost in it
it happened right before we met , simon
i don't know that much
just that you were up here to see peter
i don't even know why
you never used to like to talk about your brother
there was a fight over their father's estate maybe you read about it
anyway after the accident
this is the hospital you were taken to , i know that much
wait a minute i was here before?
i really need a cigarette
so , we have our two moments simon
both were accidents both led you to st jude's
i can't remember
it doesn't make sense
none of this makes any fucking sense
two days ago you came up here to close up your parents 'house
it's been sitting here for two years , ever since ...
anyway , you finally agreed to let it go
you were going to pack up the furniture fix some of the fixtures finish the old staircase and
refinish?
interesting
not really , it's a gorgeous place but it's falling apart
no , no , what i mean is well , one or two of simon's enzyme counts are lower than normal
but i thought you said i was okay
i said practically , kid
but your lower enzymes are an indication that somehow your bloodstream was poisoned
are you saying someone tried to poison him?
i'm not trying to say anything
but it's highly possible that your condition was caused by fumes from certain cleaning solutions or varnishes trapped in an enclosed space
so now what?
well , you'll be fine
we've got you an atropane
we'll reactivate your cholinesterase with one of the doximes
the sooner you can eat something , the better
i've scheduled an mri to make sure that everything is a okay
so , if you'll excuse me
i'm sure you've seen enough of me to last you a lifetime
i'll check back in with you in a few ...
anna?
you can drop the pretense now you smug fuck
my god , i knew you were a good liar but this performance is unbelievable !
i don't know what the hell you're talking about
then i'd pay closer attention
don't think you're going to win this little game of yours because i'm a much better player than you are
this is about her isn't it?
do you think i'm that blind?
is she really worth this?
all of it?
who are you talking about?
i'm talking about you
a rich little daddy's boy in way over his head
this would actually be sad if you weren't so pathetic
wait !
you said peter was dead
of course he's dead you killed him
knock knock , mr. cable it's time for your mri
what happened?
ask him sleep well , honey
you ...
hey !
come on , home boy
i'm gonna take you on a little trip
this isn't happening
man , i didn't think you could get any whiter but you look like you've seen a ghost
you have to lie here
so?
what'd make someone wanna kill a nice all american dude like you?
what?
who said what?
relax , man it's just a rumor
everyone talks about everything around here
especially nurse clayton arms down , please
nobody was trying to kill me
it was just chemical i was using on the stairs
right , yeah fumes must've got to you
keep your head still
anyway , my point is this everybody dies
no mystery there
but why and how everyone dies?
that is a mystery we would solve
probably the biggest mystery there is
man , you're not making any sense
i'm not the one who can't remember what year it is
okay
what's your name?
travis
straps , too tight?
travis , are you going out of your way to make me nervous?
hell no , if i wanted to scare you
i'd just tell you about the number of tumors these machines cause
you hang tight now
i don't wanna be around when this thing starts leaking
i mean scanning
dr. newman will be right along see you later
thanks , travis
hey !
you , in there
fuck
who is it?
doctor newman?
i know this sounds ridiculous but i've got this ... terrible itch on my nose
who is there?
hey , i don't suppose you can unstrap me for ...
hello?
hello?
what are you doing?
my name is simon cable
you want to check the chart or something?
i don't think i need that !
get off me get the fuck off me !
somebody !
somebody help me !
somebody help me !
sweet jesus
what the hell just happened?
what are you , some kind of a lunatic or something?
who's that?
this is a hospital pal not a nuthouse !
oh , hey doc !
glad you could make it
we got a live one here
how did i just get here?
just get into bed , mr cable
you shouldn't be up and about , not yet
who are you?
someone just tried to kill me
yeah , wacko !
mr travitt , enough
giving him some positive reinforcement , doc
this is saint jude's hospital
do you know why you're here?
i was just in the mri room i was strapped down mister ...
no , mr. cable , you were admitted into this room last night
now , do you know why you're here?
i wasn't in this room last night
i was alone ... in a private room
no offense taken mr. cable , look at me
all i want you to do is to answer my one question
do you know why you are in the saint jude's hospital?
yes , because of the staircase
see , i just need to talk to my wife
your wife?
just find dr. newman
he'll know where she is
we don't have a dr. newman on our staff , mr. cable
now , please look , if you don't calm down i'm ...
what do you mean you don't have a dr. newman?
i was with him all last night !
mr. cable , please !
the doctor who was here today
a pediatrician
i talked to him for about a half hour
mr. cable , please listen to me
you have been unconscious since your car accident
no , no , it wasn't an accident
it was poisoning you must not have been on duty
you've been involved in a serious road accident
and the trauma has obviously affected your memory
a car accident?
yeah
and you're lucky to be alive , actually
last night?
yeah
that's impossible
swell going , doc you calmed him right down
what are you running away from , mr. cable?
what were you hoping to find?
your mind's playing tricks on you mr. cable , that's all
there was no poison?
no , i'm sorry
and there is no dr. newman on the staff at this hospital
look , you've been unconscious so the oxygen supply throughout your system
what's the date?
what?
the date today?
july 29th , why?
and the year?
the year?
yeah , what year is it?
2000 !
so you're telling me that it's the year 2000 and i've been in a car accident
that i wasn't poisoned and there is no doctor newman
yeah , that's right
what about my wife?
your wife?
yeah , my wife
actually , your admission papers have you down as being single , mr. cable
okay , i've just spent the entire day wandering this hospital talking to a dr. newman my wife , a mystery woman
orderly named travis now , you want me to believe that none of this happened?
you want a cup of coffee?
i'm not crazy i can't be
i don't doubt you believe what you believe , mr. cable
the mind is a remarkable thing
perhaps your mind is showing you something you need to see
so being poisoned and nearly murdered
this is what i need to see?
it's not for me to say
i have been in this hospital before
but two years from now
this is not my mind playing tricks on me , this happened
and this is where you met a dr. newman and an orderly named travis?
yes , will meet
you know , it's possible you could be suffering from a preoccupied delusion mr. cable
it wasn't a delusion just consider
while you were unconscious you fabricated a story then stored it deep within your memory banks so that now awake when you look back on it it appears as real as any true memory
it was as real as these walls , or you
even when you're unconscious your senses are alive
you have overheard things and then incorporated them into your delusion
you said travis , the patient in your room is travitt you met a dr. newman i'm truman
it's like in a dream
you think you heard a siren and then when you're wake you realize it's only your alarm
hey , wacko , you know what i've been thinking?
i swear i know you from somewhere , i mean
were you anybody been in the papers or anything?
what about anna?
is she also just part of the dream?
yes , mr. cable , i would venture that she is
i just want to remember i have to
sorry to interrupt , doctor
i wanted to bring in one of my nursing students to check mr. hungout's vitals if that's okay
that's fine , nurse clayton go right ahead
okay , what the hell was she doing here?
it's just nurse clayton?
but she was in my dream
mine , too , hey what's she wearing in yours?
how are you today?
that's ... but you said ...
what?
what is it?
that's ... she's my wife !
anna?
yes?
anna have you been here in the last 24 hours?
no , is everything okay , doctor?
mr. cable , i need you to get into bed right now
how could i know her name , huh?
how could i?
i know who you are i got it
you're the son of that dead rich guy , aren't you?
you're all in on this
you're all out of your fuckin 'minds !
i know i was here !
i was in this goddamned room !
anna !
tell him you know me !
a dactyl ten tell him you know me !
mr. cable , just come and sit down , will ya?
it wasn't a dream !
i know
that was real , and this isn't just relax
this is bullshit !
what are you doing?
this is for your own good
no !
no , please
that's it i'm telling you
you're not real !
who's there?
what do you want?
what do you want?
get away from me !
doctor !
doctor , doctor , doctor !
has to be on the door you're gonna hurt yourself this is around that goddamn door !
keep your head still mr. newton ...
someone behind that door !
nurse?
please !
he's right there !
five milligrams diazefam no , no !
simon , listen very carefully to what i'm saying
you've been prescribed a drug that's known to have mild psychiatric side effects
no one in the hospital who's gonna kill you
there's no one behind the door
well if you're so sure then look
simon , please
look behind the fucking door !
okay i know just look behind the door
not to see if there is someone there
but to prove to me that there isn't someone there
this will relax you
c ward i'll join you there in a minute
don't leave !
don't you leave me !
simon , i have other patients who need me
but they're not about to die !
neither are you
and that's a promise
goddamn you people !
mr. cable , please have some consideration for others
then get me off this thing
the doctor's orders were quite clear
yeah , i know , i know but i'm claustrophobic
one hand
yeah , well , it'll keep you quiet for a moment but just a moment
mr. cable , i am not going to fight you
what i will do is call security
mr. cable , you're meant to stay here until you're ready to ...
what are you looking for?
he was here i know he was
it's 2002
someone just tried to kill me
i promise you , kid that is not true
pralidoxime is known you're not listening to me
someone tried to kill me before the nightmare just after that orderly left me strapped to that goddamned machine
you've got to believe me someone came into the room ...
take it easy , kid
try and relax take a breath
good , okay
now , i wanna show you something i think may help
and that's me waking you up
keep your head still
no masked intruders my friend
it was so real i , i just ...
under the influence of some psychoreactive drugs nightmares can be indistinguishable from reality
it couldn't have been a nightmare
you saw it for yourself , simon
you were all alone in that room
i know i was here two years ago , after my accident
see now that's good
i told you to start remembering
and the quicker that happens the quicker you accept what really happened
the quicker you'll finally be able to move on
yeah , but still , i ... it wasn't as if i was remembering the past
it was as if i was part of it
i could interact with the people there
i got it figured out then
maybe whoever it was that came after you was part of your memory too
that's why he never showed up on the tape
i'll just sit here and look pretty
was there ever a doctor truman here?
truman?
that vaguely rings a bell
yes , 'cause i remember nurse clayton and uh , and a patient named travitt
no shit?
there's a travitt on the fifth floor
what?
yeah
heart transplant patient been waiting here about two years
may i help you?
i'm just uh ...
iooking up a friend
but it's two o'clock in the morning
what the fuck are you looking at?
i'm so glad to see you
hey , got a cigarette?
no , he hasn't
how you doing , doc?
mr. cable , i think we should leave mr. travitt to sleep
oh , no
plenty of time to sleep when you unplug me from all this shit
don't you recognize me?
grim reaper?
we were in this hospital together two years ago
they come and they go
come on , mr. travitt please
think back , 2 years it doesn't matter
yes , it does !
i was in this hospital two years ago i know i was
and he was here with me !
holy shit , wacko !
are you sure , mr. travitt?
abso fucking lutely , yeah this guy almost shouted the place down
i see they won't let you escape from this place either
it wasn't a delusion then
i was here two years ago it was real
this is good isn't it , doc?
isn't it?
so you think you're feeling up to a few more questions?
simon cable , born july 4th 1974
my name?
dr. newman , justin?
jeremy , close enough and the date?
is it tomorrow?
then it's the 30th of july , 2002
i'm impressed , kid who's the president?
don't worry about it
let's get you back down to your room
is uh , mr travitt ever going to make it out of here?
there's only one inescapable rule in the game of life , kid
sooner or later everybody has to stop playing
whoops , that's me
i think it'd be better if you've got some sleep
thank you , doctor i know i haven't been easy
of course we're not done with you yet
we have a puzzle downstairs that still needs to be put together
i think i just might be up for that now
okay
simon?
where have you been?
i've been looking everywhere for you
i know , i'm sorry
i shouldn't have run off i just ...
it just seemed so cruel what you were saying
you have to believe me i'm not making this up
i'm not trying to hurt you
i honestly don't remember who you are
the doctor swears my memory will return , but it just might take some time
i've got time
i'll help you

the car accident last night?
and about your brother
i need you in the icu miss hathaway

we can finish what later?
simon?
clairee?

i've been thinking about you but every time
it's true about peter

you were with peter and i knew?
simon , stop , what's wrong with you?
we were having an affair?
he was my brother , clairee
don't do this , not now well didn't you loved him?
stop it
did you ever love him?
of course i loved him
things change you know all this , simon
and us?
why?
i guess now we have one of those moments
you know , people are always talking about them
something that happened in the past , so ...
a moment that you wish you could go back to and change
something you wish you could have said or done differently
so , would you?
change what happened?
wouldn't you?
it's really good to see you , si
was that your brother's fiance?
what do you want miss hathaway?
you know , you can call me anna , if you want
i just want to tell you something if you had a second
what?
well , i think you'll like this story 'cause it's about your brother
i was alone in the icu when he woke up
what do you mean he woke up?
it was really beautiful you know this one last fight for life before he died
always check the patient's blood pressure , mr. cable?
nurse clayton !
patient has recovered consciousness !
vitals are dropping !
simon did this to me
simon killed me
i left it on by mistake in my pocket
i hate it when i do that
do you want some coffee?
no , that's wrong
i would never do anything to hurt him
are you sure about that?
what , what does this even matter to you?
'cause i think you're lying
i am not lying
how would you know?
you've been so confused
not about that
i would know if i'd killed my own brother or not
see , you're not really sure , are you?
why are you doing this?
truth is anything could've happened that night and you wouldn't know it
who are you?
who are you?
i guess i'm nobody
not like you rich family , glamorous
i'm just a girl who's trying really hard to be seen
bet you see me now
you're going to blackmail me
you've gonna blackmail me
i love all those pictures of you in the magazines
going to parties living the life
you're fucking nuts
won't it be so nice to be part of it all?
you listen to me i would never hurt my brother
do you understand?
if you want , i can go to the police
i'm sure they'd decide quickly what you would or wouldn't do
would it be okay if i called you simon?
you know 'cause we're going to be seeing a lot of each other from now on
you're psychotic !
wait !
you can't do this !
