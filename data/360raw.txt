fourteen military police were killed .
gen. jantapan of special forces ...

brice !
hey , tom .
hey , jake .
two days early .
listen , the agency know you're still using me?
no .
no , this is just between you and me .
well , let's keep it that way .
listen , there's something else .
we got a tape today .
what are you talking about?
there's no two ways to put this .
jessica and the winthorpe girl were kidnapped .
you're kidding .
does this have to do ...?
no .
absolutely not .
they don't even know who jessica is .
well , is it money or ...?
we don't know anything yet .
well , is she okay?
she's alive .
the abu karaf can no longer not do anything ... ... when our brothers are tortured and oppressed .
these prisoners of war will be executed ... ... within a week if our demands are not met .
all members of the abu karaf must be released with full pardons .
i demand an immediate response !
they got a list of demands as long as your arm .
we have a good relationship with general jantapan .
he favors direct action and is offering full cooperation .
gentlemen , i'm sure you understand the sensitivity of the situation .
we have to ensure this stays in the family .
nothing is released without my express permission .
we must resolve this without harm to the girls or the reputation of the u. s.
we agree fully .
that's why i'm putting agent washington in charge .
he's been operating in the area for four years ... ... and is more than qualified for the job .
leon?
thank you , sir .
the first picture you have there is the current head of the abu karaf .
name's mongkol .
since he took over ... ... they've become more hostile towards the government .
the usual stuff .
ambushing police patrols , small rudimentary bombs .
anything like this before?
nothing , sir .
where's their money from?
arms , mainly .
what about this hopper guy?
he's a good man , sir .
it's a damn shame his daughter's caught up in this .
tom , didn't you work with him?
i trained under him for two years in southeast asia .
he's been out for 10 years , though .
where is he?
he left honolulu four hours ago .
lands in sangoon at 6 a . m .
sit on him .
if he starts making waves ... ... pick him up , send him home .
yes , sir .
that's all .
thank you .
i got a plane to catch .
taxi service this way , sir .
come on .
right here .
excuse me , excuse me .
this way , please .
is this your first time in this town?
no .
hey , where you come from?
far away .
far away will be england , right?
close enough .
all right .
if you need something , just tell me .
i'll get it for you , you know .
okay .
you know , this town , i'm telling you .
there is the beautiful girls , like angels .
we have those younger , sexy girls .
we have a lot of bars here .
not only , we have a specialty massage here in this town .
it's very nice here .
i just need you to get me where i asked you , okay?
yeah , i'm going this place that you want to go ... ... but i want to give you information about the town .
if you like to drink some beers ... ... we have young girls , look good , here ... ... nice brown , black .
you'll see , you'll love it .
the ride is over .
how long will you stay?
a week or two .
how would you like to pay?
cash .
okay , would you please sign your name?
come back , you asshole !
fuck you !
open the fucking door !
don't go !
fuck you !
fuck you .
come back here !
you know my situation .
yes , sir .
it's become an international issue , and i'm under a lot of pressure .
i understand , sir .
it's my men that are being killed by the abu karaf .
we're working with the cla to finalize plans .
just make sure you don't act without consulting me .
we can't afford to upset anyone else .
yes , sir .
don't let this get out of control .
he won't leave me alone .
what's your problem , junior?
asshole , you calling me a junior?
you look like junior .
oh , you think you're tough , huh?
she's paid for , so it ain't got nothing to do with you .
i work for club , not you .
what you mean , you work for the club , bitch?
you work for me .
why don't you go back to your own genetic puddle ... ... and go for a swim , boy .
so you think you're tough , you walking in here , huh?
you all right?
yeah , i'm ...
what's going on?
get out of the way .
what's going ...?
jake .
we've got to talk .
let's go have a beer .
my old buddy , jake hopper .
so , what's up?
you here on business or ...?
i got a little problem .
that's not like you , jake .
mr. clean .
no , it's nothing like that .
it's jessica .
i'm afraid she's been kidnapped .
what do you ...?
i mean , where?
well , they say with the abu karaf up north , but ... ... i don't know too many muslims be up there , so something's funny .
what do they want from you?
i don't think it has to do with me .
jessica's friend is the daughter of senator john winthorpe ... ... and i think maybe that's what they were after .
shit , man .
i'm sorry .
listen , fitch ... ... i've been out of the game for 10 years .
i need some goddamn help .
listen , man , i mean ...
i'm not on the inside anymore , you know?
i've got some contacts .
yeah , i'll check it out .
they've been giving this government a serious headache .
do the best you can , you hear?
i'll do whatever it takes , jake .
excuse me .
jake , right?
yeah .
i want to thank you for what you did .
you're welcome .
where are you going?
back to the hotel .
which hotel?
songwat .
oh .
well , maybe we could get something to eat .
something nice .
yeah , but i'm not hungry .
thanks .
mom ... ... i want you to find dad .
we're gonna need his help .
i love you , mom .
help !
brother , i haven't forgotten my english .
you're looking very good .
thank you .
must be the haircut .
and how are your wounds?
better .
and how is your heart?
healing nicely .
i haven't forgotten that day , jake .
i'm very , very proud of you .
you stay a full monk for 10 years ...
really , really wonderful .
then again , i think you're the lucky one ... ... because your life is simple .
simple is good .
simple is very good .
i wish i had simple in my life right now .
jake , i'd like to think you came all the way out here to see me ... ... but i don't think so .
is everything all right?
it's jessica .
she's been kidnapped .
what?
by who?
well , they're saying the abu karaf , but i don't think so .
is there anything i can do?
your prayers .
i'm going to go see paijan paitoon .
how are you?
good .
how was your flight?
long .
very long .
you must be exhausted .
come .
have some tea .
sure .
we've got a unit of rangers that can mobilize whenever i say so .
but i need intel , bad .
this is a preliminary report .
it covers what we know of the abu karaf and their known locations .
i don't have the resources to deal with this for you .
i fully understand , and we'll offer whatever you need .
i'm very grateful .
until there are dead bodies , my priority is the girls .
of course .
i'm sorry that these animals have involved such innocent children .
you have to eat something .
i'm not hungry .
you need to eat to keep your strength .
we have to stay positive .
i know my dad's gonna do something about this .
he can't help us .
he can't .
you don't know my dad .
for 10 years , i have pledged my life ... ... to atone for my past .
this is my life .
but now going back on this road ... ... i have great trepidation .
if you walk this road ... ... you may not come back .
i will take with me ... ... everything you have taught me .
it is your choice .
thank you , master .
what are you doing here?
i come to bring you food .
did fitch put you up to this?
no .
he does not even know i'm here .
okay .
am i disturbing something?
no , not at all .
come in .
and she is ...?
lulu , a good friend of mine .
hey , thanks for the food .
okay?
i'll call you .
what are you doing here?
i gave back my vows .
i'm here to help you .
you need to leave now .
i've spoken to master paitoon .
he understands .
you'll screw up the last 10 years of what you've done .
i don't want you involved .
jake , you know i'll do anything for you .
i owe you my life .
brother , listen to me .
you don't owe me anything ... ... but thank you .
listen , i may have a lead for you .
a man by the name of fernand zadir , a french arab .
who is he?
algeria originally ... ... then france .
been here 15 years .
started in furniture but moved up to bigger stuff .
bigger stuff meaning arms .
yes .
and you know who runs most of his business?
abu karaf .
exactly .
let's do it .
that's fernand zadir .
he's got half the local police in his pocket .
the other half likes eating here too much to bust him .
who's that girl?
her name is lena .
she works for someone rather big .
well , let's find out how big .
i want to talk to your boss , huh?
please , sit down .
what can i do for you?
i was wondering if you could pass on a message for me .
who to?
to the abu karaf .
what business have you got with them?
probably none , but some say they had something to do ... ... with the kidnapping of my daughter .
are you sure?
i'm not sure at all , but i thought we should meet ... ... and straighten things out .
well , that is very unfortunate ... ... but i'm afraid i cannot be of any help .
pass on the message .
hey , fitch .
how you doing?
jake , how are you?
all right .
how are you doing?
all right .
lulu , come here .
i'm gonna get you laid if it kills me .
it's not what i had in mind .
what do you got?
i've got a guy coming in from singapore ... ... says he did business with the abu karaf .
when's he coming in?
says he's busy .
two days .
okay .
well , listen , did you ever hear of a guy called fernand zadir?
no .
you sure?
sure , man .
i can find out .
you do that .
okay .
yeah , man .
i will see him to the door .
yeah , you do that .
jake , i need to talk to you .
about what?
i can't tell you here .
there's something i need to tell you .
fitch lied to you about fernand zadir .
how do you know that?
he does know him .
i have seen him at the club .
what else?
nothing .
i have just seen him .
i've only been working there for three months .
so , what are you doing here?
i have some personal problems with my daughter .
how long will you be staying here?
i really don't know .
listen , there's something i want you to do for me .
bridgeport?
sang kom train yard tomorrow .
yeah .
how you doing?
all right?
all right , keep going .
good , good .
all right , i'll see you in a bit .
i gotta check on this air conditioning .
yeah .
you did what?
if the boss found out you sent it by the fucking fax , he'd kill you .
don't be such a fucking idiot .
of course i won't be there .
go by yourself .
be there at noon .
i thought i could come with you .
okay .
go home .
jake .
yeah?
be careful .
okay .
somebody up there about to snipe mongkol .
if i let him do that , i could lose the only link to my daughter ... ... and i can't let that happen .
if i shoot him ... ... a whole world of trouble's gonna come down on us .
yeah .
here we go .
some men were killed today .
you are responsible .
i know who you are .
okay , so , what would you like me to do?
mr. hopper , you disturbed an important anti terror raid .
that's not true , and you know it .
maybe a few days here will help you understand .
our hospitality is famous .
i think that'd be a big mistake .
no , mr. hopper .
you made a big mistake by coming here .
wait .
hold it .
captain , tell your men not to do anything stupid .
let him go , jake .
leon , leon .
my daughter's rotting somewhere in a goddamn hole .
do you expect me to get with your program ... ... while they're jerking our chains?
you won't leave alive ... ... without me .
do you hear?
we'll see .
jake .
he's coming with me .
i'll take full responsibility .
next time i see you , i put a bullet in your head .
go for it .
key .
i'll contact you later .
i'm taking you to the airport .
leave this to us , jake .
you look smart .
we can do this the hard or easy way .
how you want it?
i hope you're not threatening me .
you know me better than that .
listen to me .
this is my daughter .
what that means is , anybody who stands in my way ... ... it's gonna be them or me .
i don't want you in a body bag .
you ain't gonna have to worry about that .
you got something else to say?
i won't be here the next time , jake .
help me !
jessica !
jessica !
no !
no !
no !
no !
stop !
boss needs her .
she killed my brother .
get the body out of here , leave her alone .
get up !
the time will come .
jade , i'm home .
jade?
they killed her roommates , and your hotel is full of police .
this place is safe .
we've gotta find this guy fernand .
you think he set up mongkol?
no , he'd be screwing himself .
i'll see what i can do .
i'll meet you back here .
thank you , brother .
you need anything?
no .
is there any chance anybody saw you go into the office?
no .
it's just ...
just jade .
it was horrible .
there was blood everywhere .
i'm sorry .
it's my fault .
she was so strong .
it didn't matter what happened .
she ...
she never complained .
and now they're gonna come for me .
no , you're with me .
you don't have to worry .
you're with me .
you're not always going to be here .
well , i might not always be here ... ... but you can be with me as long as you want .
okay?
don't leave me .
i won't .
i'm sorry , sir .
leon had hopper released .
things like that happen , captain .
hopper will have his day .
hold out the apple , captain .
sir , please , i can explain what happened .
closer , captain .
there was nothing i could do .
i said , closer .
closer to your head !
if this happens again , you will be the apple .
yes , sir .
fernand zadir met with hopper .
soon , fitch will do the same .
silence them .
fernand uses this place when his shipments come in from the river .
sunti , are you in the mood for a dance?
we were too late .
he was all we had .
no , no , no .
i don't think so .
sooner or later , they'll slip up , and when they do ... ... we'll get what we want .
you think they'll come for you?
i pray they come ... ... because then we'll find out where my daughter is .
no !
no !
don't hurt me !
get off me !
jess !
this is a final warning .
we will execute them within 76 hours ... ... if our preliminary demands are not met .
where are we going?
fitch is all we've got .
where are we going?
fitch is all we've got .
what ...?
is this woman cra ...?
wait here .
is he gonna offer you a deal?
i don't think so .
then what does he want?
i don't know and i don't care .
and what brings you to this part of town , mr. hopper?
as you know , i'm here to find my daughter .
and i'm still looking for my money .
i understand that , but i can't help you .
if i had your daughter , you wouldn't be here .
i believe you .
this may be a long shot , but who was that woman at the train yard?
why should i trust you?
let me put it this way .
one of the kidnapped girls ... ... is the daughter of senator john winthorpe .
you do not want a bunch of these black op boys coming in here ... ... and tearing up your world .
her name's lena .
she works for bridgeport .
it kind of seems to me like maybe she's setting you up .
i think you're right .
you know they're gonna manipulate the cla ... ... into believing you're a threat .
thank you for saving my life .
nothing personal .
for me , it's all about the girls .
i'm just here for those girls .
hey , buddy .
how you doing?
great .
how are you?
you know , fitch , you ain't nothing but a trailer park bitch .
i think i figured it out .
you lost out on the heroin out of the north .
it all went to the chinese in the triangle .
you lost out on the abu karaf in their arms dealing ... ... because , hey , they're muslims , and after 9l11 , well ...
so you orchestrate the kidnapping of two poor little innocent girls .
then you enlisted thai special forces and the cla ... ... to crush your business competition , but you made one big mistake .
you kidnapped my daughter .
you done?
good , because i just wanna say , jake ... ... you're a fucking dog .
you're gonna die right here ... ... and your body's gonna rot in a hole , just like jessica's .
i suggest you put your gun down ... ... and tell us where his daughter is , okay?
the general's taking really good care of her .
what do you think of that?
great .
i like this one .
i want him .
well , you're not my type , but , hey .
you enjoying this?
good ... ... because it's the last thing you're ever gonna see .
i liked you much better as a bitch .
are you enjoying it?
jake , this is between you and him .
please don't kill him .
jake , give me a break , huh?
for old times 'sake .
i'm just ...
you know , i'm really confused .
didn't you just say i'm a dog and i'm gonna die in this hole ... ... just like my daughter?
sunti , this is not a good man .
what are we gonna do?
it's not like i can take him home to mama .
i guess he sealed his own fate .
it came from the president's office 10 minutes ago .
do you think we're doing the right thing?
i don't think we have any options , sir .
what about the girls?
senator winthorpe wanted more time ... ... but the boss has made up his mind .
hi , shirley .
get me leon .
yep .
yes , i think it's for the best .
i can have colonel rose mobile in 12 hours .
did you find hopper yet?
still nothing , sir .
listen , hopper's a joke .
a washed up old man .
i'll take care of him .
sir , did you know a fitch mcquoid?
sure .
he's retired , right?
he was found dead in his club three hours ago .
stay in touch .
general , my people have decided to move forward as planned .
i understand .
i'll let my officers know .
you're doing the right thing , leon .
be careful .
i'll be fine .
listen , i've been thinking .
not that anything would happen ... ... but in the rare event that i don't come back ... ... this will be enough to tide you over for a while .
the phone number of my good friend tom collins is in there .
you call him .
all right?
keep it .
i will be waiting for you when you get back .
time to go .
all right .
you got both of those?
yep .
yeah .
leon .
how'd you get this number?
abu karaf don't have my daughter .
you know that .
but jantapan does , and i think you know that .
going to get the girls .
thanks .
wait a minute .
hopper .
shit .
clear .
get us out of here !
let us out !
please !
stay here .
you might defeat me ... ... but you cannot defeat the magic .
it's okay .
it's your father .
you can come out now .
hey , come here , baby .
what'd you think , i wasn't gonna come and get you?
thank you .
thank you .
we did it , jake .
that we did .
sunti .
see you next time , jake .
move in .
go , go , go .
wait , stop .
stop , all right?
put your men at ease .
goodbye , brother .
