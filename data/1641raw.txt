'they will say that i have shed innocent blood .
'what's blood for if not for shedding?
'with my hook for a hand
'i'll split you from your groin to your gullet .
'i came for you . '
this is the scariest story i've ever heard and it's totally true .
'it happened a few years ago near moses lake in lndiana .
'clara was baby sitting for the johnsons
'and billy pulls up on his motorcycle .
'she wasn't even going out with billy .
'she was going out with michael for about six months
'but she always kind of had the hots for billy
'because he was like a bad boy
'and michael was ... he was just so nice .
'so anyway , she decides that tonight's the night
'that she's going to give billy what she never gave to michael . '
have you ever heard of candyman?
no .
his right hand is sawn off .
he has a hook jammed in the bloody stump and if you look in the mirror and you say his name five times he'll appear behind you , breathing down your neck .
you want to try it?
'so billy began .
'he looked in the mirror , and he said ... '
candyman ...
candyman ...
candyman ...
candyman ...
no one ever got past four .
not here .
go downstairs .
i have a surprise for you .
'she looked in the mirror
'and i don't know why
'but she said his name the last time . '
candyman .
'she turned out the lights ... '
... and what he saw turned his hair white from shock .
killed her .
split her open with his hook and then killed the baby too .
and billy got away but soon after , he went crazy .
my ... my roommate's boyfriend knows him .
so when did you first hear this story?
my friend heard it on the radio .
it's true .
sick , huh?
the baby sitter just roasted the kid like it was a turkey or something .
so , what's the deal?
you guys doing a page on serial killers?
something like that .
well , that's it .
we're done .
thanks .
no problem .
see you .
see you .
see you .
seems like they're getting younger every day .
does anybody remember the craze for the pet baby alligators?
when they got too large to keep people flushed them down the toilet .
they live in the sewers .
some or them are 30 feet long .
where did this happen?
in miami .
they went blind and albino from living in the dark .
it wasn't miami .
it was new york .
i read it in the paper .
then it must be true .
why would danny and diane both be suffering from the same delusion in two cities over 1 , 000 miles apart?
let's face it , folks .
there are no alligators in the sewers .
no , it's ... it's round the campfire .
it's bedtime stories .
see , these stories are ... modern oral folklore .
they are the unselfconscious reflection of the fears of urban society .
that's lunch .
like the primordial reptile it's formed into a monster .
why?
ouch !
oh ...
the dashing professor .
the lovely wife .
helen , you know everybody?
crme de la crme ...
harold , diane , danny , stacey .
hi .
hello .
so , keep up the good work .
thank you for your contributions .
thanks .
bye .
awesome lecture .
bye .
see ya .
so , you want to tell me about this girl?
what's her name?
stacey .
she could barely look me in the eyes , trevor and she was blushing .
well , i guess it's because she's madly in love with me .
all those bursting adolescent hormones .
you don't really think ...
no , of course not .
good .
i should hope not .
so , what's the matter?
trevor , you promised you wouldn't do the urban legends lecture until next semester .
you knew bernadette and i were gathering data .
why did you have to ruin it?
i love you dearly but i can't hold up their education while the two of you complete your thesis .
i have a curriculum to follow here .
yes , i know .
well ... so don't be mad at me .
'lf you look in the mirror and say his name five times
'he'll appear behind you , breathing down your neck . '
can i clean your room?
oh , sure .
don't mind me .
'so billy began .
'he looked in the mirror
'and he said , " candyman , candyman , candyman ... " '
candyman , huh?
yes .
have you heard of him?
you doing a study on him?
yes , i am .
what have you heard?
everybody scared of him once it get dark .
he live over at cabrini .
my friend told me about him .
cabrini green?
yeah , in the projects .
i live on the south side so i don't know much about it .
but my friend know all about it .
her cousin live at cabrini .
they say he killed a lady .
can i talk to your friend?
sure .
kitty?
yeah , what do you want?
lady down here want to talk to you .
all right .
she coming .
i'm helen lyle .
pleased to meet you .
henrietta mosely .
and this is kitty culver .
tell her what you told me about the candyman .
all i know is there was some lady in a tub , and she heard a noise .
do you remember her name?
her name was ruthie jean .
she heard banging and smashing like somebody was making a hole in the wall .
so ruthie called 91 1 .
she said , " somebody is coming through the wall .
and they didn't believe her .
they thought the lady was crazy , right?
so she called 91 1 again and they still didn't believe her .
when they finally got there , she was dead .
was she shot?
no .
she was killed with a hook .
schhht !
it's true .
yeah , i read it in the papers .
candyman killed her .
yeah , but ...
i don't know nothing about that .
helen , this is sick .
this isn't one of your fairy tales .
the woman got killed here .
that's not the half of it .
that's cabrini green not that you'd recognise it today .
yeah , no kidding .
i won't even drive past there .
a kid got shot there the other day .
everyday .
ok , now look carefully at this picture and then this one .
you spot it?
no .
that's not cabrini green .
that's this building , lincoln village .
my apartment was built as a housing project .
no .
yeah .
now take a look at this .
once finished the city realised there was no barrier between here and the gold coast .
unlike over there where the highway and the el train keep the ghetto cut off .
so they made some minor alterations .
they covered the cinder block in plaster and sold the lot off as condos .
how much did you pay for this place?
don't ask .
now , wait till you see this .
here's the proof .
the killer , or killers ... they don't know which ... smashed their way through the back of this cabinet .
see?
there's no wall there .
there's only a medicine chest separating us from the other apartment .
hey , hey , what are you doing?
there could be somebody on the toilet .
no , the apartment is vacant .
are you sure?
there .
ok , now take a look .
that is amazing .
what?
there's somebody there .
i saw a light .
there's nobody there .
psych .
that's not funny .
you didn't scare me at all .
yeah , right .
ow .
you don't believe all that nonsense , do you?
i don't .
do you?
no .
all right .
candyman , candyman , candyman , candyman ... ... candyman .
oh , you chicken !
you have to do it five times .
come on .
i did it .
better safe than sorry .
trevor?
no , no !
what's the matter?
oh , trevor !
who were you expecting?
what time is it?
it's late and i'm smashed .
sorry i scared you .
what's with the arsenal , bernadette?
we're only going eight blocks .
you're the one who got us dressed up like cops .
i just said dress conservatively .
we look like cops .
why are you trying to scare me?
i'm not trying to scare you .
i just want you to think .
the gangs hold this neighbourhood hostage .
ok , let's just turn around then .
let's just go back and we can write a boring thesis regurgitating the usual crap on urban legend .
we've got a real shot here , bernadette .
an entire community starts attributing the daily horrors of their lives to a mythical figure .
now , if trevor and archie were in on this do you think they'd chicken out?
in a second .
exactly .
all right .
you want to wait here for me?
no .
well , let's go .
and lock the car .
hey now .
want something , baby?
i got it for you .
yo , baby ...
which way you going?
just going inside .
yeah?
hey , come up in here .
who you looking for?
a friend of ours .
sure you not the police?
look like five oh to me .
ask blondie where she going .
who you going to see?
let's take the stairs .
come on .
hands up , people !
five oh coming up the back door .
it's ok they think we're cops .
they're not going to follow us .
hang on .
look at this .
this is great .
" sweets to ...
" ... to the sweet .
" sweets to the sweet .
hurry up , helen .
let me just get the door .
sorry .
jesus , helen .
here it is .
don't go in there .
come on .
come on .
jesus , it stinks .
see , i was right .
the layout is identical which means the bathroom is over there .
helen ...
what's the problem?
a woman died in there .
leave it .
it's all right .
there's nothing to see .
wait a minute .
this is where he crawled through , right?
yeah .
well , we found it .
let's go .
wait a second .
ok , hang onto this .
what?
i'm just going to go through and when i get back , we're out of here .
you've got to be kidding .
it's just a derelict apartment .
what if somebody's packing drugs in there?
you just going to apologise and give them your card?
all right , let's listen .
there's nobody in there .
ok , but hurry up .
be careful .
give me the camera .
you've got five minutes .
ok , five .
dammit .
bernadette ...
i ran out of film .
i've got to back .
no way .
you can't believe ...
no way , helen .
we're out of here .
what you all doing in there?
we're just leaving .

no .
we're not cops .
we're from the university .
well , you don't belong here , lady ... going through people's apartments and things .
i'm helen lyle and this is bernadette walsh .
we're doing a thesis and were wondering if we could talk to you for a few minutes .
here , this is my card .
my baby .
come on .
come on , let's go .
you know , whites don't never come here except to cause us a problem .
believe me that's not what we want to do .
let's go in .
so you say you're doing a study?
what you gonna say?
that we bad?
we steal?
we gang bang?
we all on drugs , right?
we ain't all like them assholes downstairs , you know?
i just want to raise my child good .
he's a beautiful little boy .
and he's all i got .
what's his name?
anthony .
i'm anne marie .
anne marie mccoy .
nice to meet you .
sorry we disturbed you .
we'll just get out of your way .
it's ok .
i mean , i don't mean to be rude , and it's ... you know , it's just ... the white folks that come around here ain't too hand shaking with us , you know?
hey , what you doing?
let me help you .
you making a mess here?
thank you .
thanks .
you got kids?
no , but i'd love one .
hey .

yeah .
they're not going to get him .
you want to know about ruthie jean?
they all been here , you know .
newspapers , cops , case workers ...
they all want to know .
i heard her screaming .
i heard right through the walls .
i dialled 91 1 .
nobody came .
nobody came .
everybody scared .
he could come right through these walls , you know?
i'm scared .
scared for my child .
they ain't never gonna catch him .
who?
candyman .
lf they asked for something , if they saw something they liked , and you point ...
they thought it was rude to point .
so what did they do?
spat over people .
it was quite extraordinary .
be nice .
i am being nice .
so , how are the two most beautiful graduate students getting along?
trevor tells me you've been dabbling in my favourite subject .
i can't wait to review your data .
i can fit you in tomorrow morning .
we're not ready yet .
that's precisely the moment in which i can be of greatest assistance before you disappear down a path to academic bolivia .
i've been there .
actually , purcell , we're about to bury you .
helen ...
what?
we'll have something in a week or so .
it's just that we only went to cabrini today ...
ah !
cabrini green?
candyman country .
well , if you're after the hook man , helen , you must read the paper i wrote about him ten years ago .
you do know the story , don't you?
no .
then how are you going to bury me?
the legend first appeared in 1 890 .
candyman was the son of a slave .
his father had amassed a considerable fortune from designing a device for the mass producing of shoes after the civil war .
candyman had been sent to all the best schools and had grown up in polite society .
he had a prodigious talent as an artist and was much sought after when it came to the documenting of one's wealth and position in society in a portrait .
well , it was in this latter capacity that he was commissioned by a wealthy landowner to capture his daughter's virginal beauty .
well , of course , they fell deeply in love and she became pregnant .
poor candyman .
her father executed a terrible revenge .
he paid a pack of brutal hooligans to do the deed .
they chased candyman through the town to cabrini green where they proceeded to saw off his right hand with a rusty blade .
no one came to his aid .
but this was just the beginning of his ordeal .
nearby there was an apiary .
dozens of hives , filled with hungry bees .
they smashed the hives and stole the honeycomb and smeared it over his prone , naked body .
candyman was stung to death by the bees .
they burned his body on a giant pyre then scattered his ashes over cabrini green .
hello .
anne marie ain't in .
are you sure?
yeah .
she said you'd be back .
what's your name?
jake .
listen , jake , maybe you can help me out .
i wanted to find out about that woman who got killed .
do you know anything about that?
her name was ruthie jean .
i don't know nothing .
did anybody else talk about it?
you know , it's ok to talk to me , jake ... because i'm not a cop so nobody's going to get in trouble .
i can't say nothing or candyman will get me .
candyman?
you scared of him?
i ain't scared of nobody but you're crazy walking here on your own .
it ain't safe around here .
yeah , i know .
but i don't scare too easy either , jake .
you know , you don't have to tell me .
you could just show me .
and if you show me where candyman is
i'll make you a promise .
it will be our secret .
unless you're too scared .
somebody building a bonfire?
yeah , for the party .
in there .
candyman's in there?
my friend charlie say so .
a boy got killed there .
who was he?
ain't sure .
charlie tell me he was weird .
he was crazy?
no , a retard .
his mom was in the store ... and the boy , he need to go , you know , to the bathroom .
his mom was taking her time choosing this , looking at that so the boy start moaning .
his mom get mad at him send him across the street .
his mom is at the checkout .
she hears her boy screaming .
mommy !
mommy !
there's a big tough guy .
he runs over to check it out .
he come out of there shaking and crying .
he only been in there five seconds .
come out of there and his hair turned white .
i mean , it turned white just like that .
was the boy murdered?
worse .
he's lying on the floor in a pool of blood holding himself .
mommy !
mommy !
they found it floating in the toilet .
can't fix that .
better off dead .
did candyman do this?
listen , you wait here for me , ok?
ok .
hello?
candyman .
oh , excuse me .
i'm done here .
i'll just get out of your way .
listen , i don't want to interfere with your business .
i'm not a cop .
i'm from the university of illinois .
i'll just get out of your way .
come on !
let me go !
you're not being very smart .
my colleagues know where i am and they're expecting me back .
now let me go !
i hear you looking for candyman , bitch .
well , you found him .
we hear you're looking for candyman , bitch .
step back .
number four step forward and say the line .
we hear you're looking for candyman , bitch .
step back .
number five step forward and say the line .
we hear you're looking for candyman , bitch .
step back .
take 'em out .
it's number five .
good work .
how d'you catch him?
we swept the place .
we start from the top floor and work our way down .
that way you can flush 'em all out .
whole of cabrini is locked down now .
you're very lucky to be alive , ms lyle .
did he kill ruthie jean?
no question .
killed that poor kid as well .
he ran the overlords .
we knew everything about him .
only reason why we didn't bring him in before because we couldn't find anyone to testify .
we can't protect them down at cabrini green and they knew that .
what about the little boy ... jake?
we don't need him .
we have you .
hey , jake .
i just wanted to thank you for saving my life .
i wanna go home .
we'll get you out of here .
you did good .
you said it was our secret .
you lied !
it still is , jake .
you won't have to go to court .
candyman will get me .
candyman isn't real .
he's just a story .
you know , like dracula or ... or frankenstein .
a bad man took his name so he could scare us .
but now he's locked up everything's going to be ok .
candyman ain't real?
no .
hey there !
whoa .
slow down .
you're supposed to be the invalid here .
look , see?
it's much better today .
yeah , it looks great .
come sit down .
you haven't eaten already?
no , of course not .
ok , good .
hey !
welcome back .
thanks .
let me see .
i'm so glad you're ok .
but you know what bugs me about the whole thing?
two people get brutally murdered and the cops do nothing .
a white woman gets attacked and they lock the place down .
this was a bad guy .
you got him put away .
that's what matters .
oh !
i've got a surprise for you .
what?
you're not going to believe it .
the pictures .
my friend in the photography department managed to save most of them .
i'd written them off .
the camera was smashed .
i've been talking to some publishers and there's a lot of interest since you made the local section .
we're going to be published .
i'll come over tomorrow at 9 : 00 .
we'll get started?
yeah .
helen ...
yes?
helen ...
who is that?
who is that?
helen ...
i came for you .
do i know you?
no ... no ... but you doubted me .
i'm sorry .
i have to go .
no need to leave yet .
but i'm late .
you were not content with the stories so i was obliged to come .
be my victim .
be my victim .
i am the writing on the wall the whisper in the classroom .
without these things i am nothing so now i must shed innocent blood .
come with me .
no !
anthony !

frank .
ms lyle , you're under arrest .
do you understand?
please let me explain .
do you understand?
yes , but ...
you have the right to remain silent .
do you understand?
this is crazy .
i was attacked .
respond to the question .
i understand .
at approximately 1 0 : 00 pm .
anne marie mccoy returned to her apartment .
she discovered her dog with its head cut off .
she cried for assistance at which point you attacked her with a meat cleaver .
you were still in possession of this weapon when the arresting officers came to her aid .
where's the baby?
i ... l don't know .
you're sick .
before i ask any further questions would you like to have counsel?
yes or no?
i ... l'd like to make a phone call .
i'm sorry , we can't take your call .
please leave a message after the tone .
trevor , are you there?
pick up .
it's an emergency , trevor .
pick up the phone .
i've been arrested .
i'm at the 1 8th district .
can you ... can you please come pick me up?
that's it .
do you know what time it is?
3 : 00 am .
noooo !
no !
oh , god .
there's got to be another way out .
cover her face .
don't say anything .
ok .
all right .
you'll be fine .
just keep your head down .
it's going to be fine .
all right , people , back off , back off !
we have no comment .
no comment .
nothing to say .
do you know the baby's whereabouts?
my client has not been charged with a thing !
lnformation has indicated that baby anthony was abducted and may still be alive .
the blood may have come from the dog .
a suspect was released this morning after questioning and i guess we'll just have to follow this one ...
well , at least they didn't mention your name .
that's good .
now , they haven't charged you , because they think they'll find the body which means , i'm afraid they're shooting for murder one , but i don't think they have a chance .
do you think i did it?
no .
nobody believes that .
but it's crossed your mind?
is there anything , any detail , however small , that you can recall , that would help us substantiate your version of events?
i ... l blacked out .
i mean , i don't know what happened .
i just woke up in that place and there was blood everywhere .
can i get you anything?
are you sure?
look , honey ...
i was supposed to go to the campus and pick up some work .
i'm concerned about leaving you alone though .
i'll only be about 20 minutes .
trevor ...
where were you last night?
i was here .
i was fast asleep .
i thought you were with bernadette .
look , honey ...
i'm going to stand by you .
we're going to get through this ok?
i'll be right back .
believe in me .
be my victim .
do you believe in me?
keep away from me .
i have the child .
allow me to take you or he will die in your place .
your disbelief destroyed the faith of my congregation .
without them , i am nothing .
so i was obliged to come .
and now i must kill you .
your death will be a tale to frighten children , to make lovers cling closer in their rapture .
come with me and be immortal .
helen?
bernadette ...
bernadette , go .
helen?
helen , honey .
it's bernadette .

'that's correct .
'unit 212 , come in , please . '
'why do you want to live?
'lf you had learned just a little from me
'you would not beg to live .
'i am rumour .
'it is a blessed condition , believe me .
'to be whispered about at street corners ,
'to live in other people's dreams
'but not to have to be .
'do you understand? '
'please , god ,
'don't let him kill the baby . '
trevor !
trevor?
trevor !
where are you going?

bernadette ...

i can prove it .

what were you going to do?
wait till i got out before you told me? !
helen ...
but you knew i was never coming out , didn't you?
i think we should call the hospital .
ok .
go on .
go on .
is that what you want to do?
call them .
i'm not a murderer .
i'm not .
trevor , you were all i had left .
oh ...
it's over .
if you'd like to make a call , please hang up and try again .
they will all abandon you .
all you have left is my desire for you .
helen .
you came to me .
the child .
we had a deal .
surrender to me now and he shall be unharmed .
we have a bargain .
but i'm afraid .
do you fear the pain or what is beyond?
both .
the pain , i can assure you , will be exquisite .
as for our deaths , there is nothing to fear .
our names will be written on a thousand walls .
our crimes told and retold by our faithful believers .
we shall die together in front of their very eyes and give them something to be haunted by .
come with me and be immortal .
no !
no !
hush .
hush .
you're mine now .
it's time for a new miracle .
it was always you , helen .
it was always you .
he's here .
i'm coming .
it's ok .
check it out , man .
oh , yes .
what happened?
we got the candyman out there .
i saw him go in there .
candyman's in there .
i saw him .
i knew you'd come .
burn him .
hush .
burn him , burn him , burn him , burn him ...  burn him , burn him !
help !
burn him , burn him , burn him !
help ... help me !
burn him , burn him !
you lied to me !
we must be on our way now , you and l .
our bones will soon be ashes and we shall never be separated again .
let me go .
i cannot .
we are already dead .
helen !
come back to me !
come back !
we commend to almighty god our sister helen and we commit her body to the ground .
earth to earth , ashes to ashes , dust to dust .
the lord bless her and keep her and give her peace .
god of holiness and power accept our prayers on behalf of your servant helen .
do not count her deeds against her .
for in her heart she desired to do your will .
may almighty god bless you the father and the son and the holy spirit .
my god , look at that .
