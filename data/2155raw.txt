you know mom hates when i'm late .
i told you ... we should have left earlier .
it's the same damn thing every year .
where are my blue shoes , dear?
dad , i can't find my marilyn bronson cd .
marilyn manson .
whatever her name is .
she's a guy , dad .
marilyn?
a guy?
what's the world coming to?
oh , boy ...
are you all right , darling?
yeah .
dad !
dad !
oh , god !
my god , what happened?
are we there yet?
is anybody hurt?
marion , are you okay?
are you crazy?
you almost killed us !
i'm sorry .
i must have dozed off .
i hope you slept well .
maybe i should whip you up some breakfast .
nobody is hurt .
get off my back , all right?
for pete's sakes , why don't you let someone else drive , for once?
don't worry .
that woke me up .
the pie is probably ruined .
oh , jesus !
what is that?
it's pumpkin and chocolate .
smells like ass .
i'd better go out and check the car .
the son of a bitch didn't even stop !
where are we?
we're on the road .
what does it look like?
what happened to the interstate?
i thought we could take the back way for a change .
what's wrong with the interstate?
we've taken it for years !
i was bored .
and i didn't wanna ... fall asleep .
that seemed to work .
all right .
car looks okay .
no damage .
want me to take the wheel , dad?
no , thank you , dear .
i'm growing attached to this car .
here we go again .
did you or did you not put the mercedes in the junkyard?
it wasn't my fault !
i'm just teasing you , sweetheart .
there certainly aren't very many people on this road .
it's christmas eve .
most people are at home , with their families .
damn , i'm starving !
me too .
i hope your mother doesn't get experimental with that turkey .
look , can we drop the subject?
i don't feel very good .
are you okay , honey bunny?
you want us to stop?
long car rides make me queasy .
and all this talk food isn't helping any .
how about a couple of bookers?
shut up , richard !
or some macaroni and dick cheese .
richard , that's disgusting !
but , mom , there really is a cheese called dick cheese .
chinese make it .
you've had dick cheese before , right , brad?
grow up , richard .
it's 7 : 30 already , darling .
i'm aware of that , laura .
i thought we'd come to a junction by now .
jesus , laura , do you have to suck on it like that?
that's the way i drink .
all right , you guys .
calm down .
take it easy .
marion is right .
when i played baseball , they taught us this technique to help us relax .
i still use it sometimes .
you breathe in deeply through your nose and out through your mouth .
thank you , brad .
yeah , thanks , brad .
can i ask you a question , though?
sure .
was your entire school gay , or was it just the baseball team?
richard !
what?
richard , it's a technique we use to helps us get in what we call ... ... " the zone " .
the homo zone?
richard !
this is such a beautiful night !
does anybody know the name of that really bright star right in front of us?
there's 150 billion stars up there , for christ's sake .
that one i know .
that bright one is the north star .
the only one i know .
thank you .
let's sing a song , everybody .
okay .
what?
how about " yellow submarine "?
we always do that one .
brad , how about " y. m. c. a "?
it's christmas , so how about ...
jingle bells "?
come on .
come on .
you like that part , don't you?
why did you stop?
a woman .
i saw a woman in the forest .
cool .
dad is tripping out .
richard .
are you sure , dad?
well , yeah .
dressed in white .
she was holding something .
fuck !
hi there .
we are a little lost .
you wouldn't happen to know the quickest way back to the highway?
are you all right?
did you have an accident or something?
okay .
anybody got a cell phone?
no signal .
we just passed the cabin .
maybe there's a phone .
richard , be a gentleman and make room for her .
let brad be the gentleman .
what's your problem , man?
relax , buddy .
breath in slowly through your nose and out deeply through your ass !
it's all right , mrs. harrington .
i'll walk .
i could use the fresh air , anyway .
you're not walking by yourself .
i wanna be alone .
marion !
let me tell you something , smart guy .
what?
keep busting my balls and i'll take you out of the game for good .
understand me?
yes , sir !
we'll meet you down there in just a minute .
okay , honey?
okay .
all right .
okay , we'll see you there , honey .
shit !
would you like a nice hot cup of coffee?
i think she's in shock .
we should have asked marion what to do .
honey , we don't need a shrink .
we'll call 911 .
okay .
they'll know how to handle it .
damn !
fucking stinks in here .
it's the baby ... jack ass .
where are you going , sweetie?
away from you guys .
teenagers .
what's your name?
where do you live?
she's not gonna be much help .
no .
hello , miss july .
does anybody live here?
maybe it's one of those old forest ranger stations .
jesus , laura .
you scared the shit out of me .
sorry .
they have very interesting wall hangings , these rangers .
so , what's his name?
do it , baby .
you got a ring .
you married?
marion and i are getting married .
actually ... don't say anything but i'm proposing to her tonight at her grandmother's .
remember when you said you would kill yourself if i ever left you?
i hope that was just a figure of speech , 'cause ...
brad , we've had some great times together , but ...
i think we need to go on with our lives separately .
shit .
damn !
was there no dial tone?
nao , laura , i just forgot the number for 911 .
it's amy .
my little girl .
her name is amy .
she's so cold .
not surprised .
it's freezing here .
you hold her .
no .
i'm not really a baby kind of guy .
how does she breathe with all those blanket on her face?
don't worry .
she's dead .
that's a good one .
oh , my god !
shit !
what the hell was that?
richard !
richard !
yeah , i'm here !
get over here .
where's brad and the lady?
brad !
are you okay?
yeah , i'm fine .
what's going on?
brad !
hey , dickhead !
oh , my god !
oh , my god !
dad?
what?
they got brad .
what are you talking about?
i saw brad in a car !
we gotta go .
what car?
we've gotta go !
frank , slow down .
you are gonna kill us all .
you saw a car driving by and brad was in the back of it?
yes .
i don't get that !
why ...
i saw him .
they were hurting him .
you have to stop them !
okay !
where the hell did they go?
maybe they took a side road .
did you see one?
me neither .
at least you don't drive like a pussy .
shut up , asshole !
what's going on?
why did you stop?
laura , give me the flashlight , please .
where's he going?
why did he stop?
just a minute .
stay back .
stay back !
don't come over here , for god's sake .
fuck me !
oh , god !
richard , get your sister back in the car now .
my baby .
do you have her?
jesus christ ...
what is he doing?
he's trying to get brad's phone .
with a stick?
you got a better idea?
i can't believe i'm gonna do this .
look out .
oh , god ...
good boy , richard .
give it to me .
and drop that .
that thing is dirty .
you got a signal?
thank god .
we can call the police and they will tell us what to do .
okay .
now .
now .
now .
please , somebody help me .
please !
god !
i can't feel my legs .
i can't feel my legs !
help me !
my baby is bleeding !
who is this?
baby !
wake up !
anybody , please help us .
oh , jesus !
somebody , please , help us .
frank , we gotta get out of here .
did you get the police?
the phone , it was broken .
shit .
please , let's go .
we can't leave him here like this .
richard , drag his body off to the side of the road .
jesus , what do i look like?
your fucking janitor?
thank god .
oh , marion .
are you all right?
you're gonna be okay .
marion .
marion?
marion?
wake up .
wake up .
come on , wake up .
wake up !
wake up !
laura !
stop !
stop it !
can't you see she's in shock?
i'm sorry .
i'm sorry .
dad , that guy ... or whoever did that ... ... must've used an axe or a chainsaw .
it was the work of one sick psycho .
let's get the hell out of here .
wait .
what about that woman?
maybe she got away .
maybe the psycho got her .
so , you wanna go after him?
richard , get in .
we're going to the police .
why don't we go back to interstate?
your mother lives by the sheriff's .
we'll be there in 15 minutes .
marcott?
never heard of it .
richard , check the map .
marcott ...
gimme a second .
there's no marcott on this map .
just give it to me .
i don't see it either .
maybe that's because it's not there !
laura , give me the local map .
i didn't bring it .
you didn't bring it?
we never needed it before .
i asked you to .
remember?
i had a lot of things to take care of .
the presents and ...
who gives a fuck about presents?
would you please watch your language?
i'm sorry , but how was i supposed to know you're gonna take a shortcut?
and how was i supposed to know that you were going to forget the map?
we've been coming here for 20 years , and you'd never taken a shortcut .
i'll bring a globe in case you feel like driving by way of the north pole !
is there any coffee left?
a little .
okay .
pour me some .
let's go to marcott , then .
is anybody else a bit freaked out we are the only car in the road now?
it's christmas eve .
yeah .
okay .
how long have we been driving?
it's 7 : 30 .
you said it was 7 : 30 when we took that lady into the car .
that damn thing is broken .
all right .
who's got a watch?
i have a watch .
it stopped at 7 : 30 .
come on .
don't you guys think that this is just a little wacked?
i know you guys think i'm retarded or whatever ... but i have a theory and i want you to hear me out , okay?
brad is dead .
his body is mutilated and god knows how it got that way .
we are the only people out here and all the clocks have stopped at 7 : 30 .
this reeks of alien activity , you guys .
blow me .
what?
nothing .
laura ... can you make her stop that , please?
let her .
maybe it will help .
it's getting on my nerves .
i can't believe i fell asleep .
how long was i out?
i don't know .
maybe 10 minutes .
are we still on that same road?
still no marcott?
no .
no marcott .
i don't understand .
did we pass it?
no , i haven't seen anything .
no lights , no signs , no nothing .
shit !
what is that?
it's a baby carriage .
i can see it's a baby carriage .
okay .
i'll get out and i'll go see .
no .
don't .
why?
just get going .
i don't like this .
richard , come back here !
richard !
stop yelling in my ear !
richard , come back here !
hey , little guy !
richard !
frank , no !
you guys suck !
i'm gonna kill that kid .
oh , god !
what the hell was that?
man , that was good !
this is so not funny , richard !
it's a baby carriage .
why fear?
it's empty .
no shit !
that is so not funny !
nice job .
that was dumb .
what is it now?
i can't stop thinking about diane .
how are we gonna tell her about brad?
he was our responsibility .
i don't wanna worry about that now !
i just wanna figure out some goddamn way to get out of here .
i'm sorry .
talk about a merry fucking christmas .
you are not gonna open that .
that's my uncle herb's present .
i need this a whole hell of a lot more than your uncle herb right now .
let's face it .
we are lost , frank .
this road is not going to mom's .
let's turn around .
we should turn around , frank .
we just passed a sign .
marcott can't be too far .
hey , sis .
mom ...
mom and dad are kinda going off the deep end , huh?
they are really losing it .
this whole thing is pretty fucking crazy , huh?
mare?
mare?
come on , you've gotta snap out of it , okay?
you have to .
we need you back here .
i ...
i need you .
mom is always going on about what a great shrink you are , so ... you are the only person that can figure a way out of this .
damn it !
do you remember when your hamster disappeared ... and i told you it had been abducted by aliens?
well , i lied .
okay?
it was me .
me and kevin .
we stuck it in the microwave and we fried it .
marion?
dad !
dad , it's here again .
richard , i am fed up with your stupid jokes .
it wasn't me this time .
i swear .
richard , we do not have time ...
christ !
i'm telling you the truth , your fucking assholes !
frank , would you say something for once?
i think we'd better get out of here .
get going .
we should have passed a town or a gas station or ... a motel , or a crossroads , a junction , something by now !
i know .
i know .
just calm down , laura .
it's probably one of those closed roads that forest rangers use .
god !
i just feel like we've been driving forever .
what is this forest?
is this like the amazon?
last year , i had to drive to lakewood to talk with a client and i went ... ... on a very roundabout way .
what you seem to do sometimes .
i was driving and driving until i had to turn back to the road i came from .
what are you talking about?
some of these roads are designed ... by engineers who weren't qualified to build a goddamn bird house !
so?
so?
that's that !
that's that ...
lakewood?
isn't there where sally schmidt bought her cottage?
yeah , i think so .
jesus christ !
what was that?
some kind of a radio talk show .
that was no talk show .
a public radio , or something .
public radio?
right .
no !
damn it !
you just said it was public radio !
i don't know what it was !
i don't wanna know what it was !
i just wanna get to the police before anything else goes wrong .
and i thought last year's christmas was bad .
and what was wrong with last year's christmas?
let's see ...
everything?
i thought last year was great !
we took the interstate !
i was talking about christmas dinner .
and what's wrong with my family's christmas dinners?
your family .
your mother always felt you deserved more than a used car salesman .
now that salesman has become a respected sales manager .
so , i'm sorry , baby , but screw your mother !
anything else?
your damn brother is a freak too !
he jerks off to gun magazines !
that is disgusting !
that is disgusting and that is not fair !
mikey has had a lot of hard times !
poor little mikey !
poor mikey !
wht do i have to suffer every time i talk to the son of a bitch?
you are just so sensitive !
i know it's christmas , laura .
i know it's the season of giving , but i don't give a shit right now !
i just wanna get off this goddamn road !
jesus !
mother of ... !
fuck !
oh , frank !
it's okay , honey .
we just had a blow out .
okay .
i'm pregnant .
marion !
jesus christ !
i smoke pot .
i'm gonna go change the tire .
you handle that wrench like a whore handles a baby .
fucking do it yourself , man .
you watch your mouth , goddamn it .
all right .
you want some help?
how is marion doing?
she's pregnant .
how are you?
frankly , it's been much for one night .
i'll say .
where did richard go?
he's probably off smoking a joint .
that is not funny !
our son is doing drugs !
please , laura .
can't you see this is a cry for help?
christ !
it's just a joint , all right?
not worse than those pills you take .
my pills are legal !
pregnant .
man , i hope it's a boy .
what's up , little critter?
i'm your uncle dick .
that means you'd better show me some respect , huh?
or i will fuck you up .
okay .
are you okay , honey bunny?
don't you ever call me that again .
okay .
okay , that's fine .
that's what brad called me .
uncle dick .
right on .
fuck !
i love you .
jesus !
okay .
i'm done .
let's go .
richard , we're going !
it's the car !
oh , my god ...
open the door !
open the door !
open the door !
laura !
laura !
let's go back and get the car !
dad !
dad !
richard !
richard !
come here !
laura , get in the car now !
frank ...
get in , we'll get him !
faster !
it doesn't go any faster , laura !
where is he?
i don't know .
i can't see him .
the son of a bitch shut off his lights !
they are gonna kill him .
no !
they are gonna kill him !
no , they won't !
yes , they are !
calm down , mom !
he'll be all right !
i'll get him !
it was richard !
shut up !
damn it !
it was richard !
stop the car !
stop the car !
please ...
my baby !
please ...
what did they do to you?
mom ...
come on .
come on , baby .
you can wake up .
come one , baby .
laura ...
laura ...
what?
what?
mom , he is ...
no !
no , no ...
this is one of his jokes , isn't it?
you're just like your father .
remember the time that he took me to new orleans?
we never went to new orleans .
'course not .
you're not his father .
what?
richard is not your son .
mom , what are you talking about?
she's out of her fucking mind .
i am not out of my mind .
don't you remember alan rickson?
laura ...
what?
what?
what did you say?
you remember alan rickson?
my baby .
i don't wanna go .
i don't wanna go .
please , let me stay with him .
come on .
let me stay ...
don't take me from him !
oh , god !
please , i don't wanna go .
please , frank ...
what are we gonna do?
we gotta go to the police .
how are we gonna go to the police?
we're in the middle of nowhere .
come on .
let's go , honey .
we can't leave him here .
no , we won't .
he was my son .
he goes with us .
what is it?
it's what uncle mike wanted for christmas .
thank god for the gun freak .
isn't michael coming?
michael?
who the hell is michael?
it's richard .
his real name is michael .
because that is what alan wanted to call him .
richard is dead !
okay .
would you like some pie?
it was that sign again .
how far is this fucking town?
we've been driving for 100 miles .
what a wonderful christmas .
i wonder if i should save some pie for michael?
do you think she's gonna recover?
i don't know .
but she's gonna have to face reality sooner or later .
what a wonderful chrismtas .
god only knows how she will react .
can't be any worse .
it can be much worse .
look , i finished the pie .
could i have a pen , please?
what for?
i'm gonna do a drawing .
good , good .
here , my pen .
you are so beautiful , marion .
jesus !
let's hope there's a hospital in marcott .
what if we never reach marcott?
what if she gets us first?
who?
the lady in white .
that woman with the baby?
yeah , i saw her in the woods ... ... right after richard disappeared .
you saw her?
and then i remembered the story my grandfather used to tell me .
used to creep me out every time i heard it .
look .
i made a drawing of brad .
this was his leg that was hanging out .
it's for you .
okay , mom .
wipe your face .
there was this couple that was driving home from a wedding ... in rhode island .
it was night .
it was raining .
and they saw a little girl standing by the side of the road .
and she was just wandering back and forth , clutching the school book .
they stopped and they let her get into the back seat ... and they tried to talk to her , but she must have been in shock .
they were driving on down the road , all of a sudden they heard a scream ... coming from the back seat .
they slammed on the brakes , they nearly had an accident .
miraculously , they didn't go over the cliff .
they turned to the back seat ... the little girl had vanished .
there was just her school book there , with her name on it .
barbara rose .
the entire rose family had died in a tragic car accident ... right at that cliff , five years earlier .
come on !
dad , what are you saying?
that that woman is a ghost?
look !
we've got potato chips !
i'll get them open .
i didn't know we had them .
do you want some?
mom , don't eat them so fast .
you're gonna make yourself sick .
i am not .
oh , god !
we'd better wake up from this nightmare pretty soon .
do you feel better , laura?
dad , who's alan rickson?
i have no idea .
what was mom talking about?
i never heard of any alan rickson .
she's in shock .
she's talking a whole lot of nonsense .
why would she do that?
you tell me .
wow !
look what i found !
mom , put the gun down .
it's dangerous .
it's not .
it's a toy !
it's like the one michael used to have .
laura !
i was just kidding !
laura , that is a loaded gun .
put it down .
you are just trying to scare me .
i don't wanna play with you anymore .
bang bang , you are dead !
okay .
okay , sweetheart .
you win .
i'm dead .
do something .
like what?
you are the shrink .
student shrink .
marion ...
mom !
yes , darling .
we'll play something else now .
remember when we used to play house?
i don't wanna play that .
i wanna play what michael and i used to .
laura , this is not a game !
our son is dead !
no .
richard is dead !
dad !
holy shit !
the bitch shot me in the leg !
is he hurt?
mom , go back to the car .
it's gonna be all right .
is he gonna die too?
nobody is gonna die anymore , okay?
how does it look , doc?
we'll see .
hold this .
hold this !
all right .
i have to get the pellets out .
okay .
light on the wound , please .
have you done this before?
no , this is my first time .
shit !
light on the wound !
right .
okay , brace yourself .
why?
brace yourself .
oh , god !
that hurt more than the shot !
okay , lift your leg up .
all right .
all right .
you should be all right now .
give me the keys .
i'll drive .
easy on the bottle there .
you know of a better pain killer?
driving isn't helping any .
it helps .
i don't understand it .
we should have passed a side road by now .
your grandma's place is probably miles behind us .
that's it !
this must be a military road !
you think so?
that's why we never see military trucks .
always on roads isolated !
marcott must be a military base .
that's why it's not even on the map .
i guess so .
of course !
that's it !
that's it !
dad?
dad !
it's okay , honey .
i'm here .
i'm here .
thank god !
i thought that ...
your leg ...
are you okay?
that's not so bad .
i think we finally got some good news .
come here .
look .
earlier , i showed your mother the north star .
it was on our right side .
it still is .
that means we've been headed constantly west .
so , if we left the interstate somewhere around here ... and we headed constantly west on this road ... the road must go right straight to the sea .
marcott must be somewhere on the coast .
it makes perfect sense .
it must be a naval base .
okay , okay .
so how long until we get there?
we have about half a tank of gas , we covered 150 miles on this road .
that leaves us another 40 or 50 miles until we get to the coast .
we can reach marcott within an hour , tops .
you're a genius .
but you know , i'm more than a little concerned about your mother .
mom?
you're awake?
i slept like a log .
how are you feeling?
i feel ... okay ... considering ...
now we have got ... to stick together .
we have got to support each other in our grief .
would you like me to drive , darling?
we should reach marcott soon .
oh , good !
you look not very well .
she's okay .
frank , you know , you are a wonderful father .
and a wonderful husband too .
i want you to know that i understand about you and sally schmidt .
what?
i know the whole thing .
i know how you two used to meet at the motel 6 on your lunch break .
it's okay .
i completely understand .
i have never been able to fulfill ... your sexual fantasies .
and i want to promise you ... that when we get out of here , you can do anything you want to me , darling .
and i mean anything .
anyway , the most important thing ... is that the three of us come out of this stronger .
what do you think?
not much .
good .
now ... there's something that has been bothering me ever since i woke up .
what?
who are these people in the woods?
honey , slow down .
they are waving .
hi !
oh , my goodness , why do they look so sad?
this is christmas eve .
smile !
they teach you what to do in this kind of situation?
not to panic .
frank , do you really need to suck on that bottle like that?
frank !
it's jeannine !
quick , stop the car !
who is jeannine?
she's my friend !
who died 20 years ago .
and what exactly is your point?
she's dead .
so?
so drop it !
if the dead are alive , maybe we should check out richard .
are you crazy?
think he is comfortable back there?
mom , if he was alive , don't you think we would here him?
your brother was burned alive .
how could he talk?
shut up , laura !
easy , dad .
okay .
she's driving me crazy .
could i go see jeannine now?
no , you can't !
yes , i can .
no , you can't !
yes , i can .
no , you ...
i'm gonna go now .
oh , my god !
dad , stop the car !
mom !
laura !
laura !
mom !
laura !
mom !
oh , god !
god !

maybe she went into the woods .

she would have broken her neck !
then where is she?
maybe the lady got her .
it's the black car .
you son of a bitch .
i'm gonna blow that bastard's head off .

it's here .
i hid it from mom .

marion ...
i'm gonna have a baby .
you can't leave us .
you can't leave us .
i'm sorry .
i'm sorry .
i've already lost my mother ... and my brother and my boyfriend .
i don't wanna lose you .
i don't wanna lose you .
she's gonna get us all anyway .
no .
no one is gonna get us , as long as we keep moving .
every time we've stopped , someone's gotten killed .
we have to keep driving .
we are going to marcott .
let's put your mother in the car .
you got a cigarette?
in my coat .
alan rickson was a friend of mine , back in detroit .
you don't have to say anything , dad .
then one day he came to me for some advice .
he said that he was in love with a woman .
didn't mention her name .
he said that she was married and that she loved him too .
and he wanted to know what he should do about it .
and i remember what i said to him ...
you only live once , buddy .
go for it .
just go .
you go and you see her , and if she loves you ... she will leave her husband and she will go with you .
i'm sorry , dad .
only talked to him once after that .
he said the woman had decided she didn't want to leave her husband .
she already had a kid .
a little girl .
she didn't want to lose her .
last time i ever saw alan .
always wondered why he never kept in touch .
why did you do that?
if you are scared , alcohol will only make it worse .
you think i'm scared?
you don't need to pretend .
it's okay .
no , it's not .
have you looked at the odometer lately?
we've driven 60 miles since the last time we checked the map .
i know .
we should have reached the coast .
i know .
maybe i miscalculated a little bit .
maybe .
maybe the north star doesn't indicate north .
maybe the map maker was drunk .
maybe the moon's made out of cheese .
who knows?
everything is so fucked up on this goddamn road !
after all , we don't have to drive to get to marcott .
maybe there's another way out .
like what , dad?
flying?
no .
walking .
through the woods .
this is insane .
agreed .
agreed .
you ready?
we should at least wait until sunrise .
remember what you said?
every time we stopped , somebody died .
let's keep moving .
did you hear that?
of course i heard that .
what is it?
i don't know .
we're in the woods , dad .
it could be anything .
a branch falling , a rat or something , maybe a bird .
remember what laura said about all the faces in the forest?
are there any ghosts in the woods tonight?
come on , i'm waiting !
don't ... ever , ever do that again .
you hear me?
what is the matter with you?
we shouldn't have left the car .
that's what's the matter with me !
the more distance we put between us and the road , the better off we'll be .
goddamn !
shit !
shit !
shit !
are you all right?
yeah , just dandy .
what the hell is that?
you found us a fence !
a fence .
good , good .
there must be a farm on the other side .
it's not that tight .
i'll hold it up .
you crawl under .
go on .
now you hold it for me .
okay .
dad !
look !
hello !
hello !
hello !
we're here !
we're here !
no !
no , it can't be !
how can it be?
how can ...
how can it be?
maybe we got lost .
lf we were lost ... we would have come out at the same side of the road .
somebody is fucking with us .
calm down .
i don't wanna calm down !
i want this shit to stop !
it's still locked .
so what?
so who turned on the lights?
who turned them on?
laura?
i'm not getting back in that car .
me neither .
what are you writing?
things i wanna do when this is over .
so?
do you want me to help you?
what about playing bridge?
how old do you think i am?
i wanna do something ... cool .
i wanna buy an atari , a computer , a bunch of videogames .
if you wanna do something cool , then i'd go for the playstation .
what's that?
never mind .
atari is cooler anyway .
maybe buy some of those marilyn bronson cds .
manson .
what did you write?
that's none of your business .
stop !
what's going on?
i knew it .
somebody is playing with us .
that's the same cabin as before .
there's probably 100 ranger stations on this road .
it can't be the same one .
no , it can't be .
but it is .

there's no fog , dad .
no fog?
somebody needs to pay a visit to dr. sacks to get her eyes checked .
where's the whiskey?
i threw it away , remember?
what?
you threw away my whiskey?
my whiskey?
ungrateful little brat .
dad , calm down .
you think because i'm weak ... ... you can start messing with me?
