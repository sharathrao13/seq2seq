trick or treat .
well , look at this .
all the superheroes on our porch .
ain't that cute?
we got superman here , and batman ... and his sidekick robin .
the green lantern .
and what about you , young man?
what about what?
who are you supposed to be?
i'm harvey pekar .
pecker .
harvey pekar?
that doesn't sound like a superhero to me .
i ain't no superhero , lady .
i'm just a kid from the neighborhood , all right?
forget this !
why does everybody have to be so stupid?
okay , this guy here , he's our man .
okay , this guy here , he's our man .
all grown up and going nowhere .
always a pretty scholarly cat .
he never got much of a formal education .
for the most part , he's lived in shit neighborhoods , held shit jobs ... and is now knee deep into a disastrous second marriage .
so if you're the kind of person looking for romance or escapism ... or some fantasy figure to save the day , guess what?
you got the wrong movie .
that's great .
so now you got four takes .
you ought to be able to patch one together from there .
right?
let's go to the next one , all right?
hold on a second .
do you want some water or something?
no , i got lots of orange .
do you like orange soda?
yeah , orange is all right .
all right , let's go to the next sequence .
did you actually read the script?
no .
a little bit .
just to check the construction .
you know , how the piece was constructed .
i didn't read it word for word .
do you feel weird saying this stuff?
no , i don't feel weird saying it .
i don't know how long my voice is going to hold out .
doc , you gotta help me , man .
my old lady's dumping me 'cause i can't talk .
she says i'm a social embarrassment .
now that she's got a phd , she's some hot shit academic star ... and i'm nothing but a file clerk .
me being a file clerk was fine when i was signing the damn checks for tuition .
harvey , stop talking , please , and open wide .
i started worrying my voice would never come back .
say " aah , " mr. pekar .
it's torture , i'm telling you .
what? ls it bad , doc?
it's not good .
it's cancer .
first i got marital problems , and now you're telling me i got throat cancer .
for christ's sake , man .
harvey , calm down , it's not cancer .
you have a nodule on your vocal cords , probably from screaming and yelling .
lf you don't give it a rest , you're gonna lose your voice completely .
okay .
but for how long?
a few months .
months?
hey , come on , what is this?
exactly what it looks like .
what do you mean?
you mean you're dumping me?
for what?
this plebeian lifestyle ... just isn't working for me anymore , okay?
i gotta get out of here before i kill myself .
just listen to what i have to say , okay?
don't go .
i need you , baby .
please don't go , okay?
here's our man .
yeah , all right , here's me .
or the guy playing me anyway , though he don't look nothing like me .
but whatever .
so it's a few months later , and i'm working my flunky file clerk gig at the va hospital .
my voice still ain't back yet .
thank you , harvey , dear .
things seem like they can't get any worse .
plebeian "?
where the hell did she get that shit , man?
avoid the reeking herd
shun the polluted flock
live like that stoic bird
the eagle of the rock
hey , mr. boats .
you know what that means , son?
yeah , it's from an elinor hoyt wylie poem .
it means ....
excuse me .
it means stay away from the crowds of common , ordinary people ...
and do your own thing .
no .
it means don't compromise yourself for women .
it ain't gonna do you no good .
get away from them as soon as you can .
i ain't got no woman now .
i'm living like the stoic bird , man .
it's the only way to live , son .
look at that fool there .
probably listening to that loud rock stuff .
junk , it's all junk .
i don't know .
i mean ... rock music's got some good qualities .
it isn't jazz or nothing , but you know ....
say , when are you gonna bring me in some of those good records?
some nat king cole with strings .
i don't got any of that , mr. boats .
yeah , you got that .
you're keeping them at home , though .
you won't turn loose the good stuff .
you just sell the junk .
i keep the stuff i wanna keep .
i sold a lot of good material by people that he didn't like .
mr. boats didn't like any blues or anything like that .
he played classical violin .
i started record collecting when i was 15 or 16 years old .
i started getting interested in jazz .
prior to that , i collected comic books .
i was always a collector .
i admit to having an obsessive compulsive quality in me .
it's like the treasure of the sierra madre or something .
you go to thrift shops and you go to the garage sales ... because you think you're gonna find something that's real rare .
and most of time , it's a total waste of time , but once in a while ... you'll come up with something that'll whet your appetite .
in the early '60s ...
i was with some buddies at a junk sale , looking for some choice sides ... when i met this shy , retiring cat from philadelphia named bob crumb .
you know the guy .
fritz the cat , mr. natural and all .
they made a movie about him , too .
jay mcshann .
come on , harv , you gonna buy that , or what?
i don't know , marty , it's got a lamination crack .
a quarter .
maybe i could talk it down .
you are one cheap bastard , harvey .
i know i'm tight , man .
i live on a government wage .
you collect jay mcshann , man?
yeah , man , how about you?
yeah .
but most of my records are back in philly .
harvey , meet my buddy , bob crumb .
he just moved to town .
he's an artist with the american greeting card company .
you should see his comics , harv .
they're out of sight .
i'm into comics myself .
big yum yum book .
i'd never seen anything like it .
this is terrific .
i really dig your work , man .
this peter wheat book is by walt kelly .
it's pretty rare .
yeah?
can i get good bread for it?
not yet .
let's get back to your book .
what are you gonna do with it?
i haven't really thought about it .
it's just an exercise .
no , man .
it's more than just an exercise .
it's breaking ground , man .
there's some wild shit in here , bob .
you're spitting on me , harvey .
crumb and i hung out a lot back then .
we had records and comics in common .
check it out , man .
pretty scary .
you don't know the half of it , man .
eventually , people got hip to crumb's artwork ... and he started hanging out with the bohemian crowd .
after a while , he got sick of greeting cards and moved away to san francisco ... where he got the whole underground comic scene off the ground .
he'd come back to cleveland every few years ... and people would treat him like a celebrity .
once , he came to visit when i was feeling real bad .
it was right after my wife left me .
she got so mean to me at the end ...
like i tried to keep her captive or anything like that .
i don't know , man .
but don't think i'm buying any of this growth crap , man .
everybody's always talking about how bad experiences cause you to grow ... and all that clichd stuff .
man , i got enough bad experiences and growth to last me plenty .
right now ...
i'd be glad to trade some growth for happiness .
how long you staying in cleveland , man?
i don't know , i got to see this chick in new york ... and i'm really busy with the comic book stuff .
it's good bread and all .
i'm just getting sick of the whole scene .
what are you talking about?
you make a good living doing your art , right?
how many guys get that lucky in their life?
listen , i'll tell you something .
people are starting to know the name crumb .
when you croak , man , you're gonna leave something behind .
yeah , i guess .
it's not like i'm blind lemon jefferson , or big mama thornton .
come on , man .
i tell you something , it sure beats working a gig like mine ... being a nobody flunky and selling records on the side for $1 .
well , that's true .
listen , girlie ... these glasses are six for $2 because i couldn't carry 1 2 .
but i wanted 1 2 .
so today , i'm buying six more .
but you should only charge me $1 . 50 for them .
it's all right .
you can ask the manager .
frank , i need a price check .
man , old jewish ladies will argue forever with a cashier about anything .
these glasses ....
you get behind them in line and you're gonna wait forever . ... because i couldn't carry 1 2 .
so today ....
i'm a yid myself ... and women in my family are like that , but i never got used to it .
i mean , i may be cheap , but i got limits , man .
let me explain one more time .
these glasses are six for $2 ....
wake up !
your whole life's getting eaten away with this kind of crap .
what kind of existence is this?
ls this all a working stiff like you can expect?
you gonna suffer in silence for the rest of your life , or are you gonna make a mark?
okay , i have the money right here .
even money , $1 . 50 .
you don't even have to open the cash register .
even change .
and , dear ....
oh , shit !
ever since i read your stuff , man , i've been thinking ...
i can write comic book stories ... that are different from anything that's been done .
i figure the guys who are doing animal comics ... and superhero stuff , they're really limited .
because they got to try to appeal to kids .
and underground stuff like yours has been really subversive ... and it's opened things up politically ... but there's still plenty more to be done with them , too .
pass the ketchup .
the words , the pictures , they could be more of an art form .
you know , like those french movies ... or de sica over in ltaly .
so , anyway , i tried ....
i tried writing some stuff about real life ... stuff that the everyman's got to deal with .
these are all about you?
yeah .
you've turned yourself into a comic hero .
sort of , but there's no idealized shit .
there's no phony bullshit .
this is the real thing , man .
you know , ordinary life is pretty complex stuff .
these are really ... good .
really , you think so?
yeah , this is great stuff .
i dig it .
can i take them home and illustrate them?
you'd really do that for me , man?
that would be great because i can't even draw a straight line , bob .
what's up with your voice , harv?
all of a sudden , you sound fine .
i don't know , man .
i guess you cured me .
that bonnie , her legs go forever .
how smart is she?
i don't know .
i guess she's about average .
average?
hey , man , average is dumb .
so what if she's dumb?
i don't care .
hey , man , average is dumb .
fuck that .
that's all stories by yours truly .
hot off the presses?
that's right .
we have a regular hemingway here .
no way , i don't go in for any of that macho crap .
i didn't know you could draw .
no , i don't draw , doc .
i write the stories .
harvey , am i in here?
you're in there , all right?
take it easy .
a buddy of mine and some of his friends do the art work .
let me see this .
mr. boats , it's not polite to grab things .
next time
it's not bad .
son , you done good .
but you know , i was up in toronto a few weeks back .
i saw the red chinese ballet .
now , that was beautiful .
the way those people were dancing together ... those chinese , they work hard , i tell you .
where's everybody going?
where are you sick men rushing off to?
you ain't going nowhere for now .
probably not for a long time .
but damn if they're not a rushing off to get there .
harvey , how do your co workers and friends feel about you putting them in your comics?
they love it .
they can't get enough of it .
they come up to me demanding to know why i'm not in the new issue .
most of them .
what about overhearing what people say?
are you always listening at work?
were you listening riding the bus?
the supermarket?
yeah , i listen .
i fall asleep on people , too , but i listen some .
here's our man , eight comics later .
a brand new decade , same old bullshit .
sure , he gets lots of recognition for his writing now .
his comics are praised by all the important media types telling people what to think .
but so what?
it's not like he makes a living at it , like bob crumb .
he can't go and quit his day job or nothing .
who am i kidding?
truth is , i'd be lost without my work routine .
i got a job .
hi , harvey .
do you want these gourmet jelly beans?
i gave up sweets for lent .
yeah , sure , i'll take them .
i recommend the pia coladas .
they're excellent and very authentic tasting .
it's watermelon .
that's pretty good .
wait till you try the pia coladas .
tell me something .
can you eat lentils during lent?
sure , i don't see why not .
you can't eat meat on certain days ... but lentils should be acceptable anytime .
do you think there's any connection between lentils and lent?
i don't think so .
but i'll ask sister mary fred at church on sunday .
sister mary fred , huh?
ls she cute?
she sounds kind of mannish , but who the hell am i to be picky?
you're funny .
she's a nun .
so what?
maybe she became a nun because she couldn't get a guy .
she became a nun because she had a higher calling .
higher calling?
what a crock of shit .
i don't even know why you bother praying anyway .
i enjoy the ritual , and i'm a very spiritual person .
you know , you should try believing in something bigger than yourself .
it might cheer you up .
what , do i seem depressed?
cut !
that was great , guys .
the bakery scene's next .
the bakery scene's next?
i didn't know of a bakery scene .
did you ever hear of a bakery scene?
bakery is my scene , but not in that way .
forget the bakery , let's eat some jelly beans .
i think one might be lime .
one might be mint .
what's the difference between this and this?
one's cherry , one's cinnamon .
you could tell that by just looking at them?
not me .
i have to put it in my mouth first .
loneliness can feel so bad .
there have been times i've felt lonely ...
'cause a lot of the time , it was just me and my grandmother .
i'd just be sitting in my room all day ... watching television or reading books .
that was before i bought a computer , of course .
how do you cope with loneliness , harvey?
did i say i watched television?
you mentioned you watch tv ... you listen to your jazz records , you read ... you write , you drew your stick figures ... so you could plan for your next comic book .
i've seen many of your stick figures .
that seems to be pretty interesting .
chocolate jelly beans , i'm gonna try one .
go ahead .
excuse me , can i help you?
give me ... two crullers ... jelly doughnut with the powdered sugar .
thanks for coming .
you got any of that day old bread?
i think so .
here you go .
$3 .
you're harvey pekar?
alice quinn , from school .
college , yeah .
we had a couple of lit classes together .
what happened to you?
you disappeared after two semesters .
yeah , i know .
i got good grades and all , but there was that required math class ... hanging over my head .
eventually , the pressure got to be too much , so ....
you're doing okay , anyway .
i heard all about your jazz reviews and your comics .
you did?
sure , you're famous .
meanwhile , i got my degree and i'm just a plain old wife and mother .
i'm not doing as great as you think .
my second wife divorced me , i work a dead end job ... as a file clerk .
sometimes i hang out with the guys on the corner ... but most of the time i just stay at home by myself and i read .
you're luckier than you think .
between my husband and my kids ... it's impossible for me to curl up with a good book .
i'm reading this book by dreiser now .
jennie gerhardt .
that's one of my favorites .
yeah?
i hope that book don't end like so many of those naturalist novels ... with someone getting crushed to earth ... by forces he can't control .
i think you'll be pleasantly surprised .
i mean , it's certainly not your hollywood happy ending ... but it's pretty truthful , which is rare these days .
this is me .
all right .
nice car .
thanks .
i don't have one yet .
can i give you a lift somewhere?
no , that's all right .
it's a nice day , i'll just walk .
it was nice seeing you .
when i got home , i finished reading jennie gerhardt .
it was real good .
that alice was right .
sure , lester , the main character , croaks in the end ... but at least he's old and dies a natural , dignified death .
i was more alone that weekend than any .
sometimes in my sleep , i'd feel a body next to me ...
like an amputee feels a phantom limb .
all i did was think about jennie gerhardt and alice quinn ... and all the decades of people i had known .
the more i thought , the more i felt like crying .
life seemed so sweet and so sad ... and so hard to let go of in the end .
but hey , man , every day is a brand new deal , right?
just keep on working and something's bound to turn up .
what happened to the new american splendor?
i think we sold them , babe .
all of them?
yeah .
rand , i put one aside for myself next to the register .
i haven't even had time to read it yet .
sorry , joyce , i didn't know you were such a splendor fan .
next time , take it home .
maybe i'll call the publisher .
it'll take so damn long .
shit !
why does everything in my life have to be such a complicated disaster?
okay , maybe we can call someone  what is this?
all right .
okay .
i'm gonna hustle before the vibe in here gets any worse .
you can just hang .
dear mr. pekar ...
greetings from the second smallest state in the union ...
an endless plastics and nylon plantation ...
controlled by giant chemical corporations .
to make matters more dismal , there are no decent comic book stores in my town ...
which is why my partner and i opened one ourselves .
despite our steadily faltering business ...
my partner managed to sell the last copy of american splendor number 8 ...
out from under me .
i'm a big fan , and i hate to wait for a new order .
is there any way i can get it from you direct?
sincerely , joyce brabner .
she's got good looking handwriting .
dear joyce , thanks for the ....
dear joyce , thanks for the letter .
what do you do besides selling comics?
anybody in the room ever done any creative writing of any sort?
i'm a sometime activist , and i teach writing to prisoners .
i try to help them build an interior life ...
and make art out of their monotonous , suffocating routine .
this sounds familiar .
so you married or what?
i'm divorced , thank god .
look , i think you and i got a lot in common , you know?
how am i gonna get you to come visit me in cleveland?
cleveland?
yeah .
you think that's a good idea?
it's a great idea .
you should meet me because i'm a great guy .
despite the way my comics read ...
i got a lot of redeeming characteristics .
i don't know .
where would i stay?
i don't know .
with me .
don't worry .
i'm not gonna put no moves on you .
i'm not worried about that .
hold on , i just spilled my chamomile tea all over me .
so what are you worried about then?
it's the way all the different artists draw you .
what?
i don't really know what to expect .
sometimes you look like a younger brando .
but then , the way crumb draws you ... you look like a hairy ape , with all these ... wavy , stinky lines undulating off your body .
i don't really know what to expect .
no , those are motion lines .
i'm an active guy .
look , just come out here ... and i will try to be anyone that you want me to be , okay?
that's a dangerous offer .
i'm a notorious reformer .
are you joyce?
hey , harvey .
hey .
so we finally meet in person .
yeah .
look , before we get started with any of this , you might as well know i had a vasectomy .
what's wrong?
nothing .
something's wrong .
you keep looking around everywhere .
i guess i never imagined you'd eat in a place like this .
what , me?
no , i've never been here .
i thought you'd like it .
but obviously you don't , do you?
no , it's fine .
what difference does it make?
i don't know .
none , i guess .
they got a lot of meat on this menu .
you're a vegetarian?
kind of , you know , i mean ....
ever since i got a pet cat ...
i've had a lot of trouble eating animals .
i support and identify with groups like peta ... but unfortunately , i'm a self diagnosed anemic .
also , i have all these food allergies to vegetables ... which give me serious intestinal distress .
i guess i have a lot of borderline health disorders ... that limit me politically when it comes to eating .
you're a sick woman .
not yet , but i expect to be .
everyone in my family has some sort of degenerative illness .
good evening .
i was gonna clean up ... but why should i give you any false notions?
the truth is , i got a serious problem with cleanliness .
lf i had to wash a dish 10 times , it'd still be dirty .
they even kicked me out of the army 'cause i couldn't learn to make a bed .
i've seen worse .
could you get me some water and a few aspirin?
what , you got a headache?
no , but i want to avoid one .
yeah .
let me tell you something .
sure is nice to have company .
you know , i mean ... despite all your problems , you seem like a great person .
i'm sorry if my dating skills are a little rusty .
it's just that i've been through hell and back with women .
that last one turned out to be a real nasty bitch .
i had a nice time with you , too .
yeah?
you had a nice time?
don't make people repeat themselves .
that's annoying .
sorry .
come here .
which way is the bathroom?
through the kitchen , on the right .
joyce , what's wrong?
what is it?
i don't know .
i think that yuppie food did me in .
i feel terrible .
let me at least do something for you .
can i make you something?
how about some chamomile tea?
chamomile tea?
what's a guy like you doing with that?
i thought you drank soda pop for breakfast .
i just noticed you drank a lot of it when we started talking on the phone .
the girl at the food co op ... she picked me out all kinds of this herbal stuff .
one of these is good for stomach aches .
here .
grandma bear's tummy mint or something , i think .
hey , are you still there?
i think we should skip the whole courtship thing and just get married .
man , am i glad i talked you into coming up here .
you know , any more time alone , i really might have lost it .
me , too .
you don't have any problems with moving to cleveland?
not really .
i find most american cities to be depressing in the same way .
and you're okay with the vasectomy thing?
hey , toby .
no , you can't have any of my white castle hamburger ... so please don't even ask .
yeah?
can i have a fry?
okay , but just a couple , harvey .
i'm not going to be eating dinner until very late ... and this has got to hold me over .
what have you got , a church function?
no , i'm driving to toledo to see a movie .
would you like to come?
no , i gotta go to delaware tonight .
i'm getting married .
why delaware?
the chick i'm marrying is from wilmington .
plus , i got to help her move her stuff back here .
why are you driving to toledo to see a movie?
it's not playing at the mapletown .
i didn't know you had a girlfriend .
yeah , we met last week .
what movie could possibly be worth driving 260 miles roundtrip for?
it's a new film called revenge of the nerds .
it's about a group of nerd college students ... who are being picked on all the time by the jocks .
so they decide to take revenge .
so what you're saying is you identify with those nerds?
yes , i consider myself a nerd ... and this movie has uplifted me .
there's this one scene where a nerd grabs the microphone during a pep rally ... and announces that he is a nerd and that he is proud of it ... and stands up for the rights of other nerds .
right on .
then he asks all the kids at the pep rally ... who think they are nerds , to come forward .
so nearly everyone in the place does .
that's the way the movie ends .
so the nerds won?
yes .
all right .
you know , you got this movie , and i'm getting hitched .
we both had a good month .
right .
harvey?
wait !
yeah?
how long will you be in delaware?
because i'd like to see this movie with you .
i don't know .
i'm gonna be gone a week .
but then , i'm gonna have a wife .
so i'm going to have to bring her along , too .
ls it a girl flick?
depends on the girl .
what kind of girl is your new bride?
ls she a nerd?
i don't know , man .
maybe , yeah .
she's into herbal tea .
i did end up becoming a character in his comics .
harvey tends to push the negative or the sour .
and he can be very depressed , and therefore very depressing .
harvey , do you think you portray joyce fairly?
yeah , i think i portray her fairly .
there's some things that she does that i don't put in there ...
for obvious reasons .
i don't wanna get my head cut off .
i think my portrayal is generally fairly accurate .
there've been stories that i've participated in ... or things that have happened , and i've seen them ... as a lot more happy things going on in there .
he just doesn't put that in ... because he just doesn't think that sunshine and flowers sell .
ls that right?
you always say , " misery loves company .
you know , i'm just a gloomy guy , that's all .
it's my perspective : gloom and doom .
and see , i thought i was marrying somebody with a sense of humor .
i guess i fooled you .
what a crock of shit , man .
that's not the point .
you missed the whole point of the movie .
that's not the point .
you missed the whole point of the movie .
where the hell am i supposed to find the point in garbage?
i agree with toby .
i think it's a story of hope and tolerance .
yes , it's about time that the people who get picked on get to be the heroes .
it's an entertaining flick and all , and i can see why you like it , toby .
but those people on the screen ain't even supposed to be you .
they're college students ... who live with their parents in big houses in the suburbs .
they're gonna get degrees , get good jobs , and they're gonna stop being nerds .
remember what i told you about loud talking?
use your inside voice .
look , toby , the guys in that movie ... are not 28 year old file clerks who live with their grandmother ...
in an ethnic ghetto .
that's enough .
they didn't get their computers the way you did ... by trading in a bunch of box tops and $49 . 50 at the supermarket .
you're funny , harvey .
i'm getting in the front .
sure , toby , fine .
you go to the movies and daydream ... but this revenge of the nerds ain't reality .
it's hollywood bullshit .
harvey , let him alone .
the thing that i loved about it is i was transported to another time in my life .
i like when they took the video cameras  lf everyone could see it ....
it's the same as the " i have a dream " speech .
it's very empowering .
maybe i was being so harsh on toby on account of my own problems .
you see , i wasn't even married a month ... and my old lady was already showing signs of trouble .
granted , i tend to get married fast , 'cause i'll take any woman that'll have me .
but this time i really met my match .
how about these old 78s?
can't you sell them to one of your collectors?
are you kidding me , man?
no way .
i ain't getting rid of my 78s .
forget it , then .
i give up .
how can i make more storage space if you won't get rid of anything?
you know what?
i'll get rid of stuff .
just not my good stuff .
everything is your good stuff .
how am i supposed to live here if there's no room for me?
come on , baby .
i'll make room for you , okay?
you just have to give me time .
i'm not so good at these things .
because you're obsessive compulsive .

delusions of grandeur .
see , i think comics can pretty much be an art form , man .
i mean , the pictures can be as good as they want to be ... and the words can be as good as they want to be ... and a man can do pretty much anything he wants to .
that's true , but i didn't come all the way from delaware to talk about comics .
where is my american splendor in a world that's cloudy and gray?
where life keeps passing by me day by day
where is my american splendor in a world that's cloudy and gray?
where life keeps passing by me day by day
if you think reading comics about your life seems strange ... try watching a play about it .
god only knows how i'll feel when i see this movie .
things were going pretty good for a change .
variety called me " the blue collar mark twain .
doubleday was interested in publishing an anthology of american splendor .
i hate checking bags , man .
it always takes forever .
the bus is gonna leave soon .
that means i gotta shell out an extra $30 for a cab .

that lucky yuppie is gonna get the bus in time .
you know , vasectomies are reversible .
goddamn yuppies get everything , man .
are you listening to me?
i said vasectomies are reversible .
what?
what are you talking about?
i don't want no kids .
and i came clean about my vasectomy the first time i set eyes on you .
i know , but i think things have changed .
i think we can be a family .
family?
right .
what kind of family could we possibly be?
i ain't no good with kids .
christ , i can barely take care of myself .
i can take care of the kid and you .
no way , joyce .
forget it .
i can't have no kids .
i can't do it .
where the hell is that ornette coleman album?
you know , i got a review due tomorrow .
i didn't touch it , harvey .
would you please let me sleep?
come on , it's 1 : 00 .
how late can a person sleep , man?

that don't make no difference .
don't tell me what to do .
i'm not telling you what to do .
i'm the one who moved into your city , into your home ... into your vasectomy ... into your whole screwed up life .
the least you could do is allow me to live here in my own way .
i tried everything ... but nothing could get this woman out of bed .
i mean , she wouldn't get a job , wouldn't go out ... wouldn't make friends , nothing .
joyce diagnosed herself as clinically depressed .
i didn't know what the hell she was going through ... but it was sure taking its toll on me .
joyce , we got a message here .

i can't believe my voice is going .
what's the matter?
you were fine in the hotel .

look at this .
dave's ready for you now .
he is?

'cause my stomach is growling .
there's no time to eat .

right this way .
thank you , boys .
our next guest tonight works as a file clerk at a cleveland hospital .
he also writes comic books which deal with his day to day pains and pleasures .
this is an anthology of the nine of those comics .
it's entitled american splendor .
from off the streets of cleveland , folks , please say hello to harvey pekar .
harvey , come out here .
hi , harvey .
thanks for coming out here .
have a seat .
what do you mean calling me " curious "?
i met you before the show .
i meant " curious " in a fascinating way .
all right .
a man who has the presence of one who is quite fascinating .
'cause i met you before the show .
i thought you were a pretty nice guy .
i thought , wait a minute , i might be nursing a viper in my bosom .
something like that .
you're a little defensive about this?
yeah , i'm waiting for those cleveland jokes .
go ahead .
all right , settle down .
yeah , all right .
let's explain to folks who may not be familiar with your work ... what it is you do here exactly .
you have comic books about you in your daily life .
and you also have a regular job in cleveland working at a hospital .
that's right .
you know this guy?
i'm beginning to wonder .
you could probably get by on what you make selling your work .
because people want you to write more , and you're publishing this anthology .
who?
what people?
what are you talking about?
where the hell do you get that stuff?
i know that you ....
you know , that
i'm no show biz phony .
i'm telling the truth .
go on , man .
you can't ....
at least he's keeping up with letterman .
pandering is more like it .
you mean to tell me that other people haven't contacted you for writing literary ....
i mean  you could making a living as a writer .
what are you trying to do over there?
i'm trying to get some news .
there's a big story about to break ... about the us selling arms to lran and the contras .
just relax .
don't worry about it .
finally , something good .
watch this .
i got a job .
i know you've got a job .
i've got a job .
we're both very lucky .
we both have jobs .
then what's the matter?
joke , man .
we gotta go .
harvey , i like you .
i'm on your side .
i enjoy the comic books .
quickly , tell us about the little doll .
my wife made it .
am i giving you a hard time?
no .
am i making you nervous?
no .
we have to go now .
i wanted to mention these are for sale .
they're made out of your old clothing .
right .
what do these go for? $34 .
$34 for this?
what are you , cheaper than me?
would you pay $34 for that?
no , but i'm not asking it .
my wife is .
such brilliant repartee .
shit .
so , what do you think?
megalomaniac .
hi , this is a message for harvey pekar .
from the streets of cleveland , ladies and gentlemen , please welcome ... the one , the only harvey pekar .
harvey , come on out , buddy .
it became clear pretty fast that i was invited on the show just for laughs .
you look like a lot of guys you see sleeping on buses .
sorry .
it's all right , dave , have a good time .
i know , we're doing what we can .
it's your world .
i'm just living in it .
but what the hell did i care?
letterman was an okay guy .
let him take potshots at me .
so long as i got paid and got to plug my comics .
i think to myself , you look like every police artist sketch i've ever seen .
funny thing is ... something about me and letterman clicked for the viewers .
he kept wanting me back .
it was about a year ago , this month  that's right .
no , last month .
a year ago , last month , you made your first appearance on the show .
what has happened to you since?
not much , david .
it's slow going .
i still have the same job .
but see , harvey , you're the embodiment of the american dream .
and it wasn't just me getting all the attention .
action .
are these free?
as a result of my appearances on letterman ... my buddy toby radloff , landed a gig extolling the virtues of mtv .
watch where you're going .
all right , you fucking yuppie freak .
who the fuck is this on my set?
look at this , the man of the hour .
this is my new do for the mtv generation .
we came upon toby radloff while doing a story in cleveland last year ... on his friend , the comic artist harvey pekar .
toby's a genuine nerd , and he doesn't care if you have a problem with that .
hi , my name is toby radloff , a genuine nerd from cleveland , ohio .
and as you know , many hip people ... including a lot of college students , are going to be heading for spring break .
but i have decided to spend my own personal spring break ... right here in beautiful cleveland , ohio .
that day , i had an epiphany .
it seemed that real salt of the earth people , like toby and me ... were getting co opted by these huge corporations .
we were getting held up and ridiculed as losers in the system .
this is toby radloff , genuine spring break party nerd ... signing off .
what can i say?
it was the '80s , man .
harvey , are you listening to me?
i've been reading about these kids who grew up in these war zones .
you know , palestinians , lsraelis ...
el salvadorians , cambodians .
these kids are amazing
you're that guy from the letterman show , right?
yeah , that's me .
that's so excellent .
you and stupid pet tricks are a riot .
yeah?
then how about you buy one of my comics , man?
that's the only reason i go on that dumb show , anyway .
right .
sure .
later , harvey pekar .
what an asshole !
i want to write a political comic book ... about these kids .
listen to me .
there's a conference in jerusalem in a couple of weeks .
i'm gonna start by doing some interviews there .
wait a minute .
what are you talking about , jerusalem?
lately i can barely drag you off the futon to go with me to the letterman show .
do you want to know why?
because i don't give a damn about the letterman show .
i want to do something important to me , something that matters .
you know i only go on the show for the extra bread .
maybe if you got your lazy ass up , and got yourself a job ...
i could do something that matters , too .
harvey , you're yelling .
you ever think of that?
don't ....
i'm sorry .
joyce , i'm sorry .
i guess it was good to finally see joyce excited about something of her own .
this is crazy .
can't you just do something here in cleveland?
you'll survive a couple of weeks by yourself .
all right .
be careful out there , all right?
i love you .
sure , i was happy for her , but i was still upset for me .
it was later that night when i first found the lump .
i was determined to put it out of my mind until joyce got back .
easier said than done .
what do i care?
just give me the chart .
what is your problem?
miguel , look ...
i just don't want to keep coming back here for it , okay?
harvey , that patient's due to be admitted a week from now .
why do you always fight?
how often must we go through this?
just give me the fucking chart !
we'll see what the doctor has to say .
fine .
what?
what do you mean , another two weeks?
jesus christ .
you've got to come home sometime !
hello?
goddamn it .
just walk straight out to the desk .
i know .
okay , fine .
you all set?
yeah .
i was starting to lose it .
between the lump , the loneliness , i felt like everything was closing in on me .
and with joyce over there saving the world ...
i never felt more like a sell out hack in my life .
okay .
you know , folks , if it really is true that misery loves company ... our next guest must always have a house full of people .
okay , asshole .
you're gonna pay for that one , man .
ladies and gentlemen , please welcome back harvey pekar .
harvey , this is not the forum .
this is not meet the press .
you just want me to talk about simple minded bullshit , david .
i ain't co opted like you .
i got things to say .
relax , harvey .
for instance , i want to talk about a conflict of interest situation .
can we do that , david?
how about that?
you know , like ge owning this network , nbc .
ge has basically become a military , industrial , financial
can we get the singing shitzu back here?
has he left the building yet?
you think nbc news is gonna cover what they do fairly?
i got other things i wanna talk about .
that's enough
just shut up , man !
don't push me .
i'm doing my own thing .
harvey , this is not
are you afraid of the truth , david?
it's not about what you're saying .
it's about your choice of venue .
it may come as a shock to you , but this is a comedy show .
not tonight , it ain't .
joe , come check this out .
take your winning personality and go get your own show .
i don't want my own goddamn show .
we've had you on this show many times .
you sulk , complain , and promote your comic book ... and you really haven't been appreciative .
you didn't do me any favors , okay?
i'm still a file clerk .
i've always been a file clerk ... and it's no thanks to you or to your goddamn pathetic audience .
we're gonna take a commercial .
and when we come back , guess who's not gonna be here .
you want me to leave , david?
come on , ask me like a man .
don't go hiding behind a commercial .
are things okay at home , harvey?
things are just great at home .
okay , goodbye , dave .
goodbye , america , and thanks for nothing .
harvey pekar , ladies and gentlemen .
we'll be right back .
i guess you really did it this time .
who the hell cares?
that show wasn't helping my sales anyway .
baby ... please don't go away anymore .
i just can't take being alone , you know?
lf you met those kids over there , you wouldn't ask that of me .
i'm telling you something ... if you go away again , i'm gonna lose it .
this is not up for discussion .
i need this in my life right now .
i do appreciate the fact that you missed me so much , baby .
harvey , what is that?
i don't understand .
does " tumor " mean the same thing as " cancer "?
we know the growth is malignant .
what we don't know is how far it may have spread .
once we have the results , we can make informed decisions about treatment .
cancer .
diagnosis .
mrl .
cancer .
how can i have cancer?
i don't feel sick at all .
that's a positive thing .
my cousin norman died of lymphoma .
he was 29 .
he was a brilliant oncologist .
stop it !
you're not gonna die , harvey .
you're not .
what's gonna happen to you , baby?
who's gonna take care of you
look at me and focus .
we are gonna get through this .
i understand illness .
i know how to handle these things .
yeah , but that's you , you know?
i'm not strong enough .
i don't know how to be positive .
i can't do that .
i can't do it .
yes , you can .
no , i can't .
i'll tell you how .
you'll make a comic book of the whole thing .
you'll document every detail .
and that way , you'll remove yourself from the experience until it's over .
i can't do that .
i'm just not strong enough .
man , i just wanna die .
that's fine .
i'll do it without you .
i'm fred .
you called me about the comic book .
right , the artist .
come in .
this is my daughter , danielle .
i had to bring her along .
i hope you don't mind .
hi , danielle .
what's that you're holding?
a pony .
a pony?
what's his name?
she's a girl .
clarissa .
oh , i see .
i'm joyce , and i'm very pleased to meet both you and clarissa .
i'm real sorry to hear about harvey .
ls he here?
he's going to work till next week when he starts the chemo .
that's why i want this project started ... because once he's stuck here , i know he'll take over .
shit .
fucking idiot .
hey , joyce , open the door .
i forgot my keys again .
hold the door .
open the fucking door , man !
hey , harvey .
fred .
what's going on , man?
you see , i thought it was a great idea .
joyce said if we try to just follow you through your treatments ....
she thought it was a good idea , too , didn't she?
here's some of the ideas we've been batting around .
all right .
jesus .
joyce has no idea what she's doing , man .
there's too many words in these frames .
when are you coming back , fred?
she said something about next tuesday , which is fine with me .
it's just ....
the only thing is , i might have the kid again .
my ex wife is supposed to take her , but i don't have much faith in her showing up .
she's in worse shape than me these days .
next week ... my treatment begins .
do me a favor , man .
bring the kid , will you?
thanks .
i wanna die .
joyce .
what?
what's wrong , harvey?
what are you doing up?
what is it?
tell me the truth .
am i a guy who writes about himself ... in a comic book?
or am i just a character in that book?
what are you talking about?
what are you saying?
lf i die , will that character keep going?
or will he just fade away?
oh , my god .
harvey , wake up .
wake up , harvey .
come on .
oh , no .
come on , wake up .
can you hear me?
my name is harvey pekar .
harvey pekar .
1960 was the year i got my first apartment and my first phone book .
now , imagine my surprise when i looked up my name ... and saw that in addition to me , another harvey pekar was listed .
you know , i was listed as harvey l. pekar .
my middle name is lawrence .
he was listed as harvey pekar .
therefore , his was a pure listing .
then in the '70s ...
i noticed that a third harvey pekar was listed in the phone book .
now , this filled me with curiosity .
how can there be three people with such an unusual name in the world ...
let alone in one city?
then one day ... a person i work with expressed her sympathy to me ... concerning what she thought was the death of my father .
she pointed out an obituary notice in the newspaper ... for a man named harvey pekar .
and one of his sons was named harvey .
these were the other harvey pekars .
and six months later , harvey pekar , jr . died .
although i'd met neither man ...
i was filled with sadness .
what were they like? " i thought .
it seemed our lives had been linked in some indefinable way .
but the story does not end there .
for two years later , another harvey pekar appeared in the phone book .
who are these people?
where do they come from?
what do they do?
what's in a name?
who is harvey pekar?
we've got t shirts for sale upstairs , if you're interested .
here's our man , a year later .
somehow i made it through the treatments , and the doctors are optimistic .
i guess joyce was right about doing a big comic book .
we published the thing as a graphic novel , our first collaboration ... and ended up with rave reviews .
we even won a couple of national book awards .
go figure .
those are beautiful .
did you find this in there?
i didn't even see those .
ever seen one of these flowers?
are you finished?
danielle , i love it .
very expressive colors .
what is it , harvey?
that was the doctor .
he says i'm all clear .
the weirdest thing that came out of my illness was danielle .
with her real mother running around who knows where ... and seeing how well her and joyce got on ...
fred decided she'd have a better life with us .
i was scared at first , but then i thought , what the hell .
she's a good kid .
hi , harvey .
so we ended up taking her and raising her as our own .
you keep reading them backwards .
i like reading them backwards .
ls that one you?
i keep telling you , all of them's me , man .
you look like a monster .
wait till you see what you're gonna look like .
me?
yeah , you're part of the story , too , now .
what story?
the story of my life .
i know i'm not as interesting as the little mermaid and all that magical crap
i think i'm gonna write my own comic .
yeah?
what about?
i'm not sure yet .
but not about you .
i think you have enough already .
you should write about things in your own life .
you know , like school ... and ponies .
i don't know .
girl stuff .
do you have to hold my hand?
what are you , embarrassed of me?
i know , i'm embarrassing .
i felt the same way about my father .
no .
it's just , when you hold my hand , you squeeze it too hard .
go on .
joyce is right .
you are obsessive compulsive .
go on .
yeah , so i guess comics brought me to life .
but don't think this is some sunny , happy ending .
every day is still a major struggle .
joyce and i fight like crazy .
and she barely works .
the kid's got add and is a real handful .
my life is total chaos .
with a little luck , i'll get a window of good health between retiring and dying .
the golden years , right?
who knows?
between my pension and the chunk of change i get for this film ...
i should be able to swing something .
sure , i'll lose the war eventually .
but the goal is to win a few skirmishes along the way , right?
surprise !
for he's a jolly good fellow
which nobody can deny
surprise .
