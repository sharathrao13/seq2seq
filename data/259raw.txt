i can't
i have to find out what happens to my life .
i'm not gonna kill the man .

oh my god , this is sean .
everyday for the last 6 years .
i thoughts of only 2 things .
first , i want to know what my son would look like
if i would recognise him if i saw him on the street .
i've been set up .
take me home !
there's no minority report .
i don't have an utimate future .
you still have a choice .
crow , where the hell are you?
6 years ago , you grabbed the kid at the public pool .
did i?
i don't know .
i have to think .
that boy is called david sean !
i brought him a pencil .
he was happy !
is he still alive?
is he alright?
where the hell ishe?
you can choose
you can choose ...
you have the right to remain silent .
do you have attorney?
we will appoint one .
are you trying to kill me?
you goe through this , my family gets nothing .
you're supposed to kill me .
he said you would kill me .
who's he?
he said my family is being taken care of .
if you would work?
i have to killed your kid .
you killed my kid .
you don't kill me , my family gets nothing .
what about the pictures?
they're fake .
he gave them to me .
you tell me who was it set this up?
i don't know .
who was it?
i didn't see his face .
if i tell you my family gets nothing .
kill me .
leo , let go of the gun
let go of the gun .
you ain't gonna kill me .
doesn't make sense .
if your child killed , who would leave the pictures on the bed for you to find him?
this was all arranged .
today we saw the first murder .
in the six years of the pre crime
sad enough , is human .
officers couldn't get there on time to stop them .
it happened exactly when the pre cops predicted .
danny witcrow , he's on the phone .
he said is important .
lamar .
something terrible wrong .
i don't want to say it over the phone .
meet me at anderton's
is there something that you have?
this is the murder of the woman called ann lively
you got this from the containment?
yes .
this is from the twins .
arthur and dash
agatha stream is missing
this is recorded .
this is pre vision .
no .
look at the surface wave across the water .
the ripple is moving away from shore .
this is the one from containment .
the waves has changed .
the wave doesn't move in any direction
the murder is taken place at 2 different times .
he was watching this containment before he was tag .
yes i know , he came to me and told me the missing bit .
he was afraid that you would find it
i did find it .
it was in the file the whole time .
tell me what you're thinking .
i'm thinking someone got away with murders .
how?
he told me the pre cop can see the murders more then once .
jag told is a pre cop deja vu .
what if the technicians thought he was looking at an echo?
but we're looking at a different murder we gathered .
i don't understand .
all you have to do is hire a killer to kill ann lively
someone like a drifter .
someone with nothing to lose .
pre cops stop the murders from taking place
the killer take him away but then ...
having review the pre vision . and dressed him the same clothes
can committe the murder exactly the same way .
the technicians take a look , he think he's looking at an echo erased it .
of course it would be someone have access to pre vision in the first place .
somebody fairly high up .
do you know what i hear?
nothing .
no foot step up the stair .
no hoover crafts
can you see?
is beautiful .
where are we going?
a safe place .
burgess
i'm laura .
you have to help him .
is he there?
yes .
has he got the pre cop with him?
yes .
keeps him back , i'm on my way .
please don't tell danny .
i don't trust him .
i won't say a word .
don't let john leave .
is cold .
laura this is agatha
i got so scared when tom and becky lost in the cave
you know sean .
i thought it was leo crow killed him
he didn't .
why would they set you up?
because i've found out about her .
ann lively .
doctor said he didn't die .
he need help
remember that john?
sean .
he's on the beach now , taming with water .
he say come with him
he'd been waiting for his mother up along the sand .
there's so much love in this house .
he's 10 years old .
he's surrounded by animals
he want to be a vet .
he's in high school .
he likes to run .
like his father .
he run for 2 miles
he's 23 .
he's in university .
he's after a pretty girl called claire .
he want to marry her .
he still runs .
across the university with john .
he's running so fast .
just like his daddy .
he sees his daddy .
but he's only 6 years old .
there's so much love in this house .
you see?
she just wanted her little girl back .
but it was too late .
the girl was already gone .
is she still alive .
she didn't die .
but she is not alive .
just tell me who killed your mother?
i'm sorry john .
but you have to run again .
run !
i love you .
we are placing you arrest under the murder
of leo crow .
i'm so worried about you .
i missed you so much ...
you're part of my flock now john .
it kind of a rush , they said you have vision .
for all your life , all your dreams come true .
this is all my fault .
i haven't wore this in years .
you looked good .
i knew he was having trouble for some time
and yet i did nothing about it .
excuse me , the guy from the u. s. a is here .
tell him not now .
he just wants ...
not now !
i thought you were retiring .
i was .
and then the incident with john made me realise
the fragility of all this .
i know i have an obligation to protect that .
i know how difficult this is for you .
maybe you can find some closure
in fact that john found the man who killed your son
who ann lively?
who?
ann lively .
john was talking about before they took him .
i don't know
something about him being set up ...
because he found out about her .
we know john was a hack .
he was a fake .
he was
killed with john's gun
inside the office ...
why?
do you know the reason why john came here to worked for you?
sean .
yes .
he came here to worked for you because he thought he could just
stop the thing from happening .
i understand .
no , i don't think you do .
sir , i want to start the press conference in 2 minutes
john was the best cop i ever knew .
and also the best man .
but the scar he carried around
i know he also married you . because you're as stubborn as he is
do you know how to tie this?
i'll tell you what i do , first thing monday .
i will go down to the containment file
what did you say the name was?
ann lively
i never said she was drown .
sir , the press conference is starting .
i'll be right there .
we'll talk about this later .
perhaps tomorrow .
i like an ordered with my husband .
you are not authorised .
how did you get in here?
on behalf of the staffs ,
i'd like to present you with this
congratulation to you .
my gun?
how did you get this?
i pounded on your expense account for 6 months
revolve like this one was given to generals
at the end of the civil war . by their troops .
5 gold plated bullets .
to civilize the end of the destruction and death that the country has aparted .
when pre crime goe national
maybe we can all look forward to a time none of us discharge a fire arm ever again
enjoy yourselves .
is an order .
hello?
yes .
right away .
excuse me .
sir , you have an emergency call in your private line ...
yes , this is burgeee .
i just wanted to congratulate you .
you did it .
you created a world without her
sir , can you sign this for us?
this is jag
jag , laura .
john need a favour .
i'm talking about agatha's mother .
ann lively
just a junkie never given up but
suprised , she cleaned her self up .
and she wanted her daugther back .
jag , is a single stream from the female only
with no time or data .
what ever it is .
this isn't the future .
and the problem was without agatha
there will be no pre crimes
she's always been the strongest of the 3 .
you knew without agatha , you'll have nothing
without her , you wouldn't be here where you are right now .
standing there , signing autographs .
jag , what are you doing?
he's a big man .
jag think before you sent it .
you have to get rid of ann lively .
which presented problem .
how could you kill her without the pre cops seeing it .
so you used the system you control against her .
so you hired someone to kill her for you you know the pre cops can see that .
you promised to reunite her with her daughter .
ran !
then when you are all alone you killed her yourself
in the same way the pre cops predicted your judge
you made the murder look like an echo
no one with intergrate you what you were trained to do .
and ann liverly , became just another missing person
what are you gonna do?
what are you gonna do?
we got a red ball !
think of all the lifes that i saved
think of all the lifes that i saved
i can do it .
you used the memory of my good son
to set me up !
there was one thing you knew
that would drive me to murder .
what are you gonna do now?
how are you gonna shut me up?
forgive me john .
is over .
lamar
the question you got to ask is , " what are you gonna do now?
no doubts the pre cops already seen it .
you see it don't you?
if you don't kill me .
the pre cops are wrong .
and pre crime will be over .
if you do kill me .
you'll go away .
but it'll prove the system works .
so what are you gonna do so?
what does it worth?
just one more murder .
you go to hell in hay low the people will still believe in pre crime
all you have to do is kill me .
like you say you would .
you know your own future .
which mean you could change it if you would?
you still have a choice , lamar .
like i did .
yes , i have a choice .
i always did
forgive me .
john .
in 2054 , the pre cops experiment aligned
all the prisoners in one condition ...
were primely released .
the cops watch them for many years to come .
agatha and the twins
were tranferred to an undisclose location .
i guess an final relieve from their gift .
a place where they can live in peace
the end
