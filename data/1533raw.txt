the hero , the searcher is shown the way .
like the trail of a scent " , says the novel ,
the glow in front of him led him up the stairs .
the old house sucks freder in , it makes him its prisoner , it draws him into the depths .
the machinery of the old house is like a model of the narrative mechanism , which keeps both hero and audience moving ... always being shown something , before it quickly disappears again .
another sign ...
mary's scarf .
and once again freder's call for the virgin , the mother is answered by ...
a vision , a staging .
an earlier concept for the film presented medieval and modern ages in different forms .
mrs. von harbou and l " , remembers lang forty years later , " included a battle between modern science and occultism in the screenplay , the sorcerer was the evil force behind all events " but they deviated , lang says , from this concept .
centuries behind , centuries ahead " , it says in the screenplay ,
rotwang's laboratory was " half a quack's kitchen from the year 1500 and half experimental laboratory of a man from the year 2000 .
in rotwang's character harbou and lang merged both magic and modernity in one entity .
a hermaphrodite , like the film in which he appears .
that could have been conceived and staged by him , just like the transformation of the mechanical woman into the image of mary .
his staging combines both feminine and masculine form and movement , translated into a spectacle of light .
a luciferic act of procreation .
rotwang endows his machine with mary's attributes ... but he also allows the feminine sexuality , which is repressed in the figure of the virgin mother , to be unleashed in the double .
the chaste mary , the white and merciful , the virgin , and the hot , destructive , the red , the vamp are two aspects of the same character .
rotwang's experimental table , with mary as snow white waiting in her glass coffin to be awakened , can be seen as the couch of rotwang the psychoanalyst .
her subconscious manifests itself in the arcs of light stretching between her and the mechanical woman .
freder , like awakening from a nightmare , sees himself in another one .
hel's room ... her memorial is behind the curtain .
mary's theme , agitato , in a minor key .
the false mary , flesh of the flesh of the true mary , while at the same time a remote controlled machine at the core .
why is fredersen so doggedly determined , to destroy the true mary?
in the figure of the merciful preacher , he seems to sense a female challenge
that of matriarchy to his patriarchal principle of absolute power .
freder's oedipus experience .
the shock causes freder to see father and mother whom he images as mary rotating around each other .
i want to kill you !
i want to destroy you !
i want to murder you !
in the film , a fall " downwards , into the depth " into the chasm of his subconscious .
freder in bed , the father in tails .
an obvious feeling of helplessness in front of his father's aura of authority .
the son remains in the care of the , in part female , staff .
a sick child .
freder's unconscious state again fades into a rotwang staging .
can it be that freder and rotwang are not so much rivals as the alter egos of each other?
they love the same woman , the dead hel .
the absence of the mother , the lover provides the inspiration for freder's visions just as much as for rotwang's stagings .
rotwang's audience consists entirely of men , old and young , fathers and sons .
like a blasphemous halo " , says the screenplay , the diadem on the woman's head appears in the round opening of the domed roof ... that fades out .
rotwang's show is a film , another of rotwang's light productions , with footlights and counter lighting .
rotwang's show and freder's delirium become one .
an important strand in this mesh , freder's reminiscence of the monk's sermo in the cathedral , has again been cut by the adaptors .
isolated , edited gestures and the positions of the dancer , combined with the picture of the audience
groups , singles , only eyes finally
rotwang's production becomes lang's ... pure montage cinema .
rotwang's show now clearly becomes freder's vision , the memory of the seven deadly sins in the cathedral ,
of the monk's sermon on the whore of babylon , which he associates with the image of the false mary , the new hel , the mother whore ...
which becomes one with that of the metropolis , the mother city .
freder , convalescent , is reading .
a copy of the page which was shown at this point in the film .
again , two parallel scenes , the second once more cut by the adaptors .
the spy reports to the father , the friend to the son .
nothing remains of this scene , but screenplay and score
lead to the assumption that these takes were repeated here .
only very few of the yoshiwara takes have remained intact , this one in a copy found in australia , incomplete , the end is missing , as one of the sons shoots the other .
freder and josaphat set off ,
fredersen gives slim an order ...
a third reporting situation is blended in after the other two .
rotwang tells mary .
included in his report , as a parallel action , is the activity about which rotwang is speaking .
like the group of rich sons in the dancehall , the group of workers in the catacombs , too , fall under the spell of the vamp .
like the evil character in a fairy tale , rotwang pretends his own child to be the one he keeps as a prisoner .
ufa regarded the " red " mary's speech as " inciting " and ordered a milder form for the second version .
who wants to work himself to death for the rulers of metropolis?
instead of ...
who is the life force of the machines of metropolis?
who are the slaves of metropolis?
let them rot ...
freder , who only had visions before , has gained a critical , perceiving view .
he sees through the double .
the adaptors found the construction with rotwang's report as the framework around the second catacomb scene too complicated .
georgy's martyrdom not only seals freder's new role as a critical perceiver , but also shows him as a future saviour , as a new messiah .
the central square of the workers 'city has become a stage in the theatre of the revolution .
the first beats of the marseillaise .
not only the music is imbued with the character of a citation .
the way the false mary whips the crowd into a frenzy corresponds to her performance in front of the rich sons .
the gong podium is a tribune for the performance in which not only she takes part but an ecstatic ensemble .
the elevators .
earlier we saw the night shift advancing into the elevators for transportation into the depths ... now they are being stormed by men and women , who use them to go upwards .
in a later scene , the movement accelerated and reversed , we will see them empty crashing down .
in the beginning only men were present here , now we see women , the workers 'wives , female workers .
the face of the repressed masses " was male ; only with the uprising , " unleashed , does this face obtain female traits , does its female base appear , hitherto oppressed by organisation , control , discipline .
again the same venues as in the beginning , in reverse order and viewing direction .
at the start the workers , silently waiting for the raising of the grating now the unleashed mass , men and women , deliriously determined to blow it up .
the children , abandoned by their biological fathers and mothers , offered for adoption by mary , the maternal , and freder , the brother .
again two people , two venues , alternating , audio visually bound by the video telephone in fredersen's office , control and command tool of the ruler of metropolis .
subordinate and superior .
back to the sounds of the marseillaise , the storming of the heart machine .
the true , the white , finally free to continue her reconciliation work ...
and the false , the red , the force behind uprising and destruction .
mary on her way to the city of the workers , to save the children abandoned by their fathers and mothers .
like a counter manoeuvre to her own creation by rotwang , as a light show , electric pyrotechnic sorcery , the false mary instigates the destruction of the heart machine ...
before leaving the stage via a back stairway , a shadow ascending a staircase , exit to another theatre , another audience , the sons of the rich .
arm movements as though in parody of the rotating of the disk , still identifying with the machine even during its destruction .
the elevators now finally descending , plunging .
the water .
it was said " , records the novel ,
deep under the city there wanders a stream . " joh fredersen constructed a path for the stream when he built the city of the workers .
it was also said that the stream was feeding a large reservoir and that there was a pumping station there , powerful enough , to fill or empty the reservoir in less than 10 hours .
the subterranean streams had been channelled , disciplined , obstructed by fredersen and coupled to the machines as had the people .
now the unleashed waters of the depths join the uprising of the humans .
we have seen rotwang working the levers in his laboratory and the other mary working the levers of the heart machine .
now she is moving the levers of the gong machine .
the gong podium , the alarm clock , the tribune hosting the revolt , is now used to save the children .
the square fills with the water and the children .
it is almost as if the children are involved in the flood , even though their own lives are in danger , as if they perceive the absence of adults and breaching of the banks as a liberation .
the upper city too has been robbed of electric light through the destruction of the heart machine , causing fredersen to reach for his flashlight ... to receive slim in its glow .
a couple of lovers ...
but more like a couple of parents , without act of procreation , through adoption , by saving the children , abandoned by their biological parents .
not just a couple , but three , a trinity , of which there soon will be more , with interchanging members .
they take care of the children , the innocent offspring of the workers , who have refused to be rescued by them .
a last climb through the airshaft from the depths of the workers 'city to the club of the sons .
the flying camera simulates the pressure of the explosion which rocks the city to its foundations .
finale with mary's theme ...
general pause ... then again the theme of the uprising , men and women dancing in two concentric circles , as though still under the spell of the machines they destroyed .
fredersen's office ...
fredersen , slim ... then the machine hall with the destroyed moloch machine ...
this question is musically answered ...
by a motif from the mechanical woman's theme .
thirdly , the yoshiwara , where to a foxtrot the false mary
leads the sons of the rich to dance on the volcano .
the workers abandon the scene of action .
fourthly , the entrance of the club of the sons ,
with freder .
here , a shot with mary has been cut by the adaptors .
and the children .
a square beneath this one , which the workers , ascending from the machine halls , have reached .
and finally , fifthly , rotwang's attic room , where fredersen's down and out opponent recovers .
this plot of interwoven strands again proved too complicated for the adaptors , they rearranged , they condensed .
they edited the film , giving the impression that the false mary is the only victim of the witch hunt and that the true mary is in no danger .
by readjusting this shot the true mary becomes the other .
only when you carefully look , you see here !
mary running across the screen escaping from her pursuers , who manage to couple her double .
fittingly , the workers construct a stake in front of the cathedral .
the stake is made from metal , the wrecks of cars , partly with their headlights illuminated .
the false mary tied to the stake .
she who was created by electrical sparks , totally in her element , in a display of masochistic lust .
josaphat and freder separated .
rotwang had awakened , it says in the novel ,
but he knew he had died .
and this realisation filled him with the deepest satisfaction .
he only wanted his hel .
upon finding hel he would no longer have reason to quarrel with anything on earth .
hel " , he says in the novel .
i am not a ghost , although i have died , i had to die to come to you .
mary , the virgin , and her double , both in mortal danger , a mirror image in one scene .
the red mary at the stake , the white in the cathedral , pursued by rotwang .
the bells of the cathedral come to her aid ...
beckoning the saviour ,
like the gong before in the workers 'city .
as freder watches , the fire burns away the flesh of the false mary revealing her mechanical core , musically triumphant , accompanied by one of the mechanical woman motifs in vibrant major .
the scene on the cathedral roof is reminiscent of victor hugo's
hunchback of notre dame " .
the novel had recently been filmed with lon chaney .
the gargoyles .
after the demise of the evil half of the female double pair , the final battle between the two male rivals is enacted on the roof of the cathedral .
freder , the naive fool , has learnt through his passion to differentiate between truth and lies .
then in the face of the needs of the children he has ripened to an active person , now he is capable of dealing with his antagonist .
fredersen kneeling ... he too maturing through suffering .
slim and josaphat another antagonistic pair unite to offer him assistance .
and finally grot , the foreman , less class conscious than loyal to his rulers .
in pynchon's " gravity's rainbow " , pkler remembers how rotwang carried mary onto the roof of the cathedral .
he was " taken by klein rogge playing the mad inventor , who he himself and his fellow students would have loved to be .
indispensable to those who ran the metropolis , yet at the end the untameable lion who could let it all crash , girl , state , masses , himself , asserting his reality against them all in one last roaring plunge from rooftop to street " , so remembers pkler .
in harbou's novel the chastened fredersen finds comfort with his mother , who does not appear in the film , she gives him a letter from his dead wife who pledges her love throughout all eternity .
mary , fredersen's mother , hel .
in harbou's screenplay , mary acting on an appeal from the workers 'wives calls on freder to be a mediator .
in the film as shot by lang , the women retreat totally into the underground and background .
the women retreat totally into the underground and background .
the mediator theme .
the workers , as at the beginning of the film , disciplined , darkly clothed and uniformed , marching in unison in triangular formation , the loyal foreman at the vanguard , ascend the steps at the cathedral to meet the triumvirate awaiting them in the portal .
the mediator theme culminates in a combination of the mary and the metropolis themes .
the rest is dealt with by the chiefs , the representatives of state and people , of capital and labour .
the social partners still require mutual trust .
they need a mediator , removed from the parties 'interests .
mary , as a woman is permitted to deliver the cue ,
thus completing her task .
a male trinity analogous to the father , the son and the holy spirit has been formed .
metropolis is a film of superlatives also insofar as no other film provoked as much criticism , analysis and interpretation , at least not since the nineteen eighties , simultaneously and in conjunction with new versions , new recordings , reconstruction attempts , and allusions to this film in new ones .
the film , its metaphors , its allegory require interpretation .
the interpretation is part of the film's story , even if contradictory , bizarre and excessive .
there is no need to believe or accept any of them , but they should be acknowledged as this is one of the pleasures the film offers , which are unthinkable without a certain degree of light hearted detachment .
