enjoy your hours !
grandfather .
this is for my family .
an excellent harvest , tsering .
how long do you think it will feed us?
a very long time .
a lifetime .
with all this we can't even feed the village for three months .
look grandfather , it's the caravan .
the caravan .
lhakpa .
tinle , your son has died .
he wanted to take a different route .
he said it was a one day shortcut .
i told him it was dangerous but he wouldn't listen .
a couple of hours later i found him .
dead .
this salt has been mixed with sand .
what are you waiting for?
take him off .
well?
tsering , i told you ... your father will be reborn in the kingdom padmasambhava .
when?
it'll take a while for him to get there .
he must fly over hell before he reaches buddha's paradise .
everyone will have to die in the end .
for how long will we stay dead?
all that lives has to die .
it is reborn again and dies again too .
how many lives does it take to become a leader?
we have been leaders for a very long time .
you will be next .
will you teach me what to do?
thank you .
lhakpa defied the mountains .
the mountains haven't done anything to him .
i know them very well .
you do , but lhakpa doesn't .
he is my son .
he has inherited my forces .
your pride and persistance is what you mean .
you don't know anything .
karma lied .
he has caused that accident because he wants to be the leader .
i know what i'm saying .
who will bring us the salt now?
and what about the wheat?
who will be taking care of the yaks?
no leader , no land .
no woman , no husband .
my son without a father .
this is not our lucky day .
let's try again .
this time i'll hit the target .
karma , i have no luck today .
you take the shot .
i will make a wish for you .
the gods triumph .
thanks to you my child will live .
you have shattered the heart of the evil spirit .
the evil spirit has died , but your daughter isn't safe yet .
get the doctor over here .
i have more faith in you .
i've been looking everywhere .
karma's hit the target .
ask him to teach me how to shoot .
come on let's go home .
who will teach me now?
don't worry , you're still young .
but i will become the next leader .
with daddy's bow .
i've thrown it into the river .
don't cry .
that was a lie .
it's in the house .
it's yours now .
karma was lhakpa's right hand man .
he is the one that should be leader .
he is experienced .
he has the strength and knowledge it takes .
i will be leading the caravan .
i've done it a thousand times before .
lhakpa is dead .
his son tsering should take over .
he is going alright .
it'll take years before he makes a good leader .
the gods are on my side .
tinle , we have faith in you and in your experience .
but your legs they're not what they used to be .
i will take a strong man with me .
he will be my support .
karma would be best .
karma is a traitor .
he isn't to blame for the murder of past generations .
they killed my grandfather .
and now they've killed my son .
it was an accident .
karma didn't do it .
nonsense .
kharma was chosen by the council .
the council is me .
you wouldn't be here if it wasn't for me .
tinle , there is no time to find a better man .
lama , what have you decided?
the fifteenth constellation .
the thirteenth day , monday , the fifteenth constellation .
let me have a look .
the thirteenth day ... well?
when do we leave?
be patient .
it's always the same .
you are putting our lives at stake with those calculations of yours .
the twelfth or thirteenth day .
be patient .
we were doing it this way already before you were born .
the thirteenth day , the fifteenth constellation .
this is the best day .
snow storms don't wait .
the fifteenth constellation?
isn't that later?
that's settled then .
is it this day?
monday , the fifteenth constellation ...
i can't help you tinle .
a bag of salt doesn't change anything .
it would be treachery if i took your offer .
go to karma .
he's the best .
you and your 'karma '.
karma this ...
karma that .
he will lead you into death .
you're out of your mind .
you're wrong , tinle .
karma tried to save lhakpa .
karma can drop dead .
he wants to take my place .
you're all trying to set me up .
doesn't my beer taste good , rabkie?
it does , just don't let your husband drink too much .
tinle , let's call for a truce .
you will need me .
you will not find anyone else .
i don't need you .
why are you treating me like this?
lhakpa was my friend .
i forbid you to say his name .
the mountains have seen everything .
i will lead the caravan .
alone you will .
no one is going with you .
you haven't done this in years .
they will accept me .
i was their leader before you were even born .
tsering will be my successor before you die .
your hate will not help your sorrow , tinle .
the lama's have concluded on the day of departure .
we lave in ten days .
grandfather .
who will take our yaks?
grandfather , what is wrong?
don't worry .
we'll find someone .
there's still ten days left .
are you ignoring me?
we must obey the gods .
you don't belong in the mountains anymore .
my son has died in there .
we can't help you .
don't force us to say no .
grandfather .
why do they refuse to help you?
it's not easy to take your father's place .
have you forgotten the way home?
it's been a while indeed .
every time you want to change your destiny you come to me .
come here , boy .
from now on you will be called pasang .
my name is tsering .
from now on you're pasang .
the lama's have called me tsering .
evil spirits are on their way .
they're jealous at us .
we have a lot of yaks .
if we give you a blacksmith's name they will not harm you .
your father is dead .
it is your task to replace him .
i will help you .
what are you doing , karma?
i'm leaving .
now?
you can't leave now .
winter is coming .
do you believe in those calculations?
it is the gods .
they can say whatever they want .
are you leaving all by yourself?
me and my yaks .
join me .
my father would kill me .
who's carrying the salt?
you or your father?
he is too old .
we'll join tinle .
yeah , tinle .
speaking of young men .
come here .
take tinle to norbou .
grandfather tinle , come with me .
is this color right?
the blue isn't as clear as it was yesterday .
watch closely .
we'll never finish this in time .
that is up to the gods .
we do not determine when we're done .
we have no influence on it .
the fresco knows when it is done .
what is it?
why are you here?
norbou ...
father .
karma , teach me how to use the bow .
first you have to get strong arms .
it's very important .
do you understand?
come .
we leave tomorrow morning .
come with me .
but it's before the set date !
there will be snowstorms soon .
you want to leave before tinle don't you?
let's go together .
come on , tinle can't do this on his own .
i wanted to join forces but he refused .
you ask him .
where is he?
he's in the monastery .
he's getting norbou .
why would he do that?
he doesn't know what he's doing .
he's nothing but grief .
and what's tormenting you?
it is impossible .
karma was my brother's best friend .
yes , but things have changed .
your brother is dead and i can't look after the yaks alone .
will you lead the caravan?
i have no other choice .
why?
choose someone else .
this man is you , my second son .
i don't know anything about the mountains , the yaks or the salt .
you'll learn .
no .
i've been here since i was eight years old .
i can read , know how to pray and paint .
you wanted me to become a lama .
i am no man to lead a caravan .
you have enough clothes and food .
we don't .
you sent me here as a kid .
and now you want to send me off into the mountains .
you are afraid .
not afraid enough to refuse .
you are no longer lhakpa's brother .
say your prayers if that is all you can do .
i'll bring tsering along .
he at least isn't afraid .
do we leave tomorrow?
go to sleep .
it'll be a long journey .
my wife wants to say goodbye tonight .
enjoy it .
pema .
are you there?
do you remember?
our hideout when we were kids .
did you call me just for that?
you can't leave .
not before tinle has returned .
why not?
it is tinle's law .
no , it's the dolpo's .
tinle isn't the dolpo .
he will take the decisions for himself , you and the others .
pema .
go into mourning .
come with us .
and bring tsering .
we will add your yaks to the troop .
what will you do if you can't sell the salt?
tinle will return .
tinle is old .
he can't think straight anymore .
i'm not going with you .
pema , i leave tomorrow at dawn .
are you ready?
hurry up .
we're ready .
come .
i'm ready too .
so are we .
let's go .
karma , your father .
karma , all our sons leave together with you .
i didn't force anyone to come with me .
i can't support tinle .
i wanted you as our leader , but not like that .
i have no other choice .
if you go sooner the gods will be against you .
you will be banished from the dolpo .
i am taking the dolpo with me .
you are no longer part of this .
tinle has returned .
do you see my son?
no .
i see tinle .
norbou isn't with him .
what's happened?
are you alone?
why?
everyone's here .
karma and the others have left .
where is the salt?
i've got mine .
me too .
my sons have all my salt .
what are they doing with our salt?
same as always .
we're leaving on the set date .
tinle , we're too old .
i see a couple of tough and cooperative men .
chopga , paljor , tensing , we'll make it together .
tinle , it's been years .
we can't do this anymore .
the gods are on our side , the mountains our allies .
in here we will die of embarrassment .
tinle's right .
karma .
you did it .
we did this together .
long live karma .
we'll go , just like in the old days ...
my old ngeunpo .
we'll show them .
father , there is another bag inside .
do you need it?
yes , bring it to me .
pasang , stop that , for christ's sake .
the salt .
quick .
we must not waste it .
hurry .
lama norbou .
what are you doing here?
go home .
my son is a member of the caravan now .
this one isn't properly attached .
it's going to fall off if you're not careful .
give me a hand .
tie a knot in it .
come on .
the blessing will be later .
first we get this knot right .
is it ok now?
yes it'll do .
put your boots on , boy .
don't worry .
winter is coming .
you are all old men .
what if it's going to snow?
don't worry .
pasang will be fine .
we'll take good care of our child .
but you're the child .
hurry up .
move it .
come on .
move .
tinle .
we haven't been here for so long .
you can say that again .
i'm exhausted .
are you my father's brother? yes .
do i look like you imagined?
father says you have been locked up for years .
a monastery is not a prison .
you weren't locked up?
when you say your prayers the soul leaves the body .
this is pure freedom .
where does it leave the body then?
the yaks are gone .
old ngeunpo , run like in the old days .
go .
easy , you're scaring them .
don't wave your arms and legs like that .
feel the rhythm of the yaks .
don't make any sudden moves .
if you pray to the gods like this you'll scare them .
aren't you tired?
i'm okay .
i've heard you're a good painter .
no , but my frescoes are good .
my father hasn't changed a bit .
when he screams , man and animal bow their heads and walk past .
but where to?
there they are , back there .
what's happened?
suddenly he fell .
the gods are having their revenge .
they're sending evil spirits down .
the gods have left us .
karma , what shall we do?
this is your fault .
here is his poison .
this is our evil spirit .
whoever's scared tell me , but don't blame me for it .
guide the yaks over here .
grandfather , my feet hurt .
do we have to go this far tomorrow??
yes , and the days after that too .
eventually you will develop corns under your feet .
you will be a real dolpopa .
the beginning is tough .
it stays that way .
stop whining .
karma's got a four day lead .
we must overtake them before the pass .
buddhas of the three era , padmasambhava .
rid us of all obstacles , internal , external or hidden .
make our wishes come true .
i'm not walking any further .
and i'm hungry .
just a little bit .
i'm hungry .
stop .
everyone .
pasang is hungry .
tinle , look , they're tired .
they've stopped .
what's the matter?
i want to go home .
what do we eat when we don't sell out salt?
your grandfather has never given up .
paljor , explain to him ... that a true dolpopa never gives up .
i'm too tired for that anyway .
it's because of us you're getting more and more behind by the day .
me and pasang will go back .
no you won't .
what are you going to do in the village?
pasang belongs here .
he's still a child .
yesterday he was one .
let's sit down .
tinle said we would stop by that mountain . which mountain?
can you see the shadow on the left side?
there by that mountain ridge .
next to that ravine?
no , next to that brown mountain .
the one in the sunlight?
what sun?
what mountain?
they're all the same .
you're tired .
lean on me .
i'm younger than you are .
my yak is getting old .
we've been walking for eight days now .
eight days?
it's already been ten days since we left .
what's he hoping for?
we'll never gain on kharma .
he's crazy .
we'll die in here if we're not careful .
we have to end this .
you tell him .
me?
you're his best friend?
what is that?
a tree .
will we be seeing trees on our way?
an entire forest .
have you ever seen a tree?
no .
so how can you draw them?
my teacher taught me .
how large is a tree?
when you're on top you can see far , like on a mountain .
like a leader .
what do you mean?
like grandfather .
he can see far .
i'm exhausted .
wanneer zijn we er?
i'm so tired .
grandfather .
i'm so tired .
we walk and walk and walk but we'll never get there in time .
we'll never catch up with karma .
be a sensible man .
the boy is exhausted .
if we die it'll be your fault .
we've always helped each other .
we must succeed .
succeed?
at what?
we have no other choice .
grandfather .
behind that mountain once leopards got two of my yaks .
ngeunpo's yaks .
the screaming scares away the leopards .
not just the leopards .
the caravan .
it's karma and the others .
that's not the caravan .
it's the pilgrims .
what are they?
religious people that walk through mountains .
where are you from?
mount kailash .
how far is shey riwo dupta?
less than ten days from here .
where are you going?
to the wheatlands .
have you seen the caravan?
yes , and its two hundred yaks .
when?
when?
about three , four ..
no five days ago .
can't be more than three days ago .
they were young and walking at a fast pace .
i thought we could make it .
we can't gain on them .
karma knows the mountains well .
we'll never make it .
tinle is too stubborn .
but the mountains have been kind .
in one week we could be home safely again .
the mountains are our home .
we live for the yaks and the salt .
it's insane to try and gain on karma .
you would be able to finish your fresco .
that can wait .
show me your hands .
why did you come with us?
when you left the monastery ...
i remembered the words of one of my teachers .
'if you have to choose which way to go , take the most difficult way . '
the most difficult way ...
the hardest way .
the hardest way?
some more tea?
haven't you had enough yet?
labrang , don't tell me you didn't bring any beer .
you've forbidden me to bring beer .
and you listened to that?
too bad , we have to drink karma's then .
we will take the lake route tomorrow .
for god's sake , tinle .
the devil's path?
i walked the path long ago once and i'm still here .
do evil spirits live there?
if we make it ...
we will be ahead of them by the time we . reach the pass you go .
i'm leaving
you just go .
and keep your frontdoor locked tightly .
tinle , you're asking too much of us .
what do you want to eat this winter?
salt?
i'm going to get our wheat .
we have no other choice .
we will be facing evil spirits .
in the flesh .
enough praying .
we're leaving .
hold the yaks .
what's wrong?
part of the path fell down .
stop .
we can't pass here .
what are you doing?
the yaks can't turn around and go back .
we must go through .
give me that stone .
not that one .
a smaller one .
where are you going?
you're going to fall !
i want to help grandfather .
be careful .
of course i will .
you can't pass .
stay there .
stop them .
will this be strong enough?
are you asking me?
try it .
come , ngeunpo .
if you can make it all yaks will .
the path is safe now .
tundrup built it .
just like your fence .
get the yaks coming one by one .
oh god .
careful .
there is just enough room .
step by step .
give me your hand .
we've made it .
one yak and two bags of salt .
it is the price the spirits asked .
look , more pilgrims .
they have yaks with them .
are you serious?
it's a caravan .
it's pilgrims .
no , it's a caravan .
there is a lama there .
it look like that's ngeunpo .
it's tinle yaks .
it's tinle .
and pasang , chopga en norbou .
they're all there .
tinle is here .
karma , tinle is here .
we'll make camp there .
welcome tinle .
join us for a drink .
we'll stay here for two days .
let us take care of your yaks .
they're already unloading them .
i didn't know you were this close behind us .
i would've waited .
i haven't been following you .
i left at the date we set .
bu that's four days after we left .
four days?
no one can be that fast .
it's impossible they left so late .
he's done the impossible .
ling's prophesy .
when there's good weather ahead the salt crackles .
when the weather's going to be bad it's as silent as the grave .
i don't hear anything .
the salt is silent .
bad weather is coming .
we're leaving tomorrow .
it didn't crackle .
the salt didn't crackle .
tinle ... we have been walking for two weeks straight .
our men and our yaks are exhausted .
we were going to rest for two days .
the grass is good here and the sky is blue .
the sky is playing games with us .
the salt didn't crackle .
we must cross the pass now .
we can't put our lives at stake for a handful of salt .
this salt has helped us for centuries .
are you listening to him?
salt can't talk .
it's nonsense .
you must take the gods seriously .
if we survive this we have ourselves to thank for it .
ourselves .
not the gods .
please understand .
you are a leader , but not his son .
sometimes i wonder if lhakpa ...
he didn't want you to come .
i wanted to follow him .
i should have persisted .
don't blame yourself for it .
do you see that star?
if you look closely you'll see that it beats just like a heart .
it is this star you must learn to find .
there are so many stars .
yes , but this one star ... is ours .
this is the star that will lead us to the land of the wheat .
our grand grandfathers already followed this star .
where is pasang?
have you seen pasang?
no .
are you coming with him?
come with us .
you won't survive the snow storm .
you will die here .
where is that snow storm?
have you seen the stars?
tinle is wrong .
he know these mountains .
come with us .
do it for me .
you have to choose now .
either you come with tinle or you're staying with me .
you're just like him .
all you ever think of is yourself .
and what about you?
when will you start thinking of yourself?
karma .
pasang .
let him , father .
stay out of this .
so should you .
come with us .
i can't .
come with us , everyone together .
help him up .
we're taking the salt .
tinle's going to get us all killed .
aren't you cold?
tinle , let's stop .
we'll never make it across .
we can't even see where the path is .
we must face that storm .
let's wait for it to pass .
there is enough food for four days .
if we go back we'll all die .
i am tinle .
master of the mountains .
father ...
are you alright , father?
don't listen to them . keep going , even though you're going only slowly .
do not make camp before you reach the four chorten .
why?
keep on walking .
i'm going to see if anyone was left behind .
grandfather .
straight into the mountains , boy .
have you seen my father?
no .
i thought he was with you?
father ...
tinle ...
if we're not careful we'll get lost too .
we have to keep searching .
he's got lost in the dark .
there .
father ...
he saw the storm in the clear blue sky .
i didn't see anything .
i walked straight into the trap .
if you'd come with us you wouldn't have saved him .
did i save him or did the mountains spare him?
you don't understand .
he will take everything from you .
you're the leader .
don't think like that father .
i'm not a leader .
i'm a painter , a son who helped his father out .
and pasang?
pasang has made his decision .
everything will be alright .
let them .
are you going shooting?
learn how to saddle your yak .
wear this or you will be blinded .
and you'll cry .
the boy is in good hands .
it's up to you now .
don't forget ... a leader guides his people ... but receives his orders from the gods .
don't you ever forget .
i dreamt that you were my father .
you're too much like me for me to be your father ... for you to be my son .
do you think i've never wanted to defy the lamas?
a true leader starts by being disobedient .
the gods triumph .
what are you doing?
put me down .
i'm staying here .
we will look for herbs to cure you down in the valley .
you want to cure me?
i'm not ill .
i'm old .
leave him here .
he belongs here , in these mountains .
chopga's right .
it's what he wants .
karma , you will have to be their leader .
just go .
take good care of pasang .
you've gotten behind too much already because of me .
we're almost there .
i can't leave you behind when i've just found you .
we've always been connected .
we've always wanted the same .
tinle , please don't die .
let him go .
he's going to join my father in padmasambhava's paradise .
i've learned so much .
from you , my father tinle , my brother lhakpa ...
from you , my nephew pasang of you , pema ... and from you , karma .
this fresco is for you .
it's finished .
it tells a story .
the story of pasang ...
the youth of a leader .
the gods triumph .
