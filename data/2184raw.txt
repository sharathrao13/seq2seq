love mom & dad
i know it's been hard for you because of the accident .
i'm almost a father to you .
think about it once more .
you shouldn't do this however little hope there is .
soo hyun needs to prepare herself too .
it won't be possible to keep her from finding out .
arguing with you is no use ...
the prescription's for a week .
if anything happens come in at once .
what is this?
soo hyun , congratulations on your discharge !
a wig?
let's go , quick .
let's get the hell out of this damned hospital .
either to die slowly like me ... ... or to speed along and go with a bang ...
which would be better?
at least there'd be no sense of terror ...
better to go with a bang , right?
ji hyun .
have i really been cured?
good ...
that's really great .
i'm sorry i didn't realize you'd come .
how is the work going?
it's almost finished .
i'm glad .
actually , we decided to set it in a different location .
this way , please ...
do i look that scary?
would you dry my back?
stop it .
is this me?
what are these silly wings?
wait , what about ki seok?
today?
ji hyun?
ki seok , have you been drinking?
something came up ...
there's something weird between you two .
did something bad happen?
no ...
don't you ...
like my sister?
if you don't like her how about me?
i'm a woman now too .
look at him .
i can't even play jokes on him !
until soo hyun leaves us ...
until then at least , let's laugh .
even i feel frustrated .
soo hyun is soo hyun and you are you .
you've done enough .
ma'am , please look at this dress .
you don't mind if i wear your clothes?
do you happen to remember this?
when we went to the amusement park as kids ,
dad took pictures with this .
ji hyun , let's go out .
there's something i want to do .
no , i'm right ...
look at that !
would you take our picture?
thanks .
hurry !
actually ,
i didn't believe you .
but it seems like i've really been cured .
after being out all day i'm still full of energy .
i almost doubt i've ever been sick .
it's like ...
i've been born again .
ji hyun , did you see that?
that bus , just now ...?
like you said ,
i must have been mistaken , right?
take off the wig .
i like it this way .
congratulations , ji hyun !
whoever the model is she's really mysterious .
you waiting for ki seok?
these days , the two of you ...
we're getting married soon .
how can you do this to me?
do you know how long i waited?
what about love?
love is what?
get up and have breakfast .
i'm going out .
i might be a bit late .
i'll be taking some pictures here and there .
what about meals?
i ate .
one , two , three !
thank you .
you're welcome .
soo hyun , come here .
hurry , soo hyun !
okay , let's take a picture .
look over there .
smile , soo hyun .
soo hyun !
soo hyun !
i want to ...
leave behind only bright memories of me .
so that my silly sister doesn't worry .
i'll leave only good memories and then go .
oh , you're back .
where have you been?
what do you think?
nice and clean?
ji hyun , give me your wallet .
i'm sick of this face .
it's a present .
cut and put it in there .
he wants a divorce .
stop it !
stop !
stop it !
what will i do?
without him ,
i'm dead .
kyung joo's here !
yeah , i heard you were discharged .
but how'd you get so pretty?
did you get plastic surgery?
ji hyun , how do i look?
doesn't this wig look great on me?
soo hyun's in the shower .
ji hyun ...
i think i know how to get him back .
where is my hair?
my hair !
ji hyun
soo hyun is looking for her wig please bring it to her .
ji hyun ...
i turned it on to wake you up .
immediate results !
isn't kyung joo a strange one?
but just leaving it at the crack of dawn?
chief detective's office
the phone records show you're the last person she called .
when did you meet her?
you may not believe it but it's lee kyung joo .
look closely .
they say her husband had a lover and asked for a divorce .
better to die together than to get divorced ...
she looked ten years older .
there must have been someone else there .
my sister's not that kind of person .
teacher , dance with me .
hurry .
look at your face ...
did my dancing shock you?
let's go now .
what?
if you're going to speak do it right .
ki seok is so hot !
soo hyun ...
i'm so scared , ji hyun .
kyung joo died .
in there ...
kyung joo died .
there's been no deterioration at all .
as if her body is taking cues from her mind ,
soo hyun's belief that she is cured ... seems to be exerting a strong placebo effect .
then what about her hallucinations?
it doesn't happen to everyone but it is possible .
the pain killer given to terminal cancer patients contains a certain amount of narcotics .
i worried about the change in her face , but the tests imply she's holding up well .
it's a relief ...
there may be hope for her .
why don't you go home and take a rest?
it seems that you didn't sleep well for several days .
we've already broken up .
i want you to stop using her as an excuse to obsess over me .
i know you're scared that when she leaves , you'll be left alone .
but there's absolutely nothing i can do for you .
they've grown bigger .
it's me .
soo hyun's here .
she stopped in to avoid the rain .
don't worry and wait at home .
i'll drive her back once she warms up .
ki seok ...
ki seok ...
ki seok ...
don't do this , soo hyun .
i am dying .
you know that .
soo hyun .
ki seok ...
i want to have you one last time .
you shouldn't do this .
you wanted me , too .
i never wanted you .
i love you , teacher .
i really love you , teacher .
i love you , teacher .
i love you , teacher .
i'm not your teacher .
you bitch .
even after getting rejected like that you still don't have a clue .
what's wrong?
ji hyun ...
you look like you're going to kill me .
ji hyun , what's wrong?
ji hyun , what's wrong?
are you crazy?
hey !
give it back !
ji hyun !
ji hyun , you bought me that wig .
give me back my hair !
give me back my hair
this wig is cursed .
we should destroy it .
ji hyun ... give me my hair !
give me my hair , ji hyun !
no !
don't do it ...
no !
don't ...
who are you to erase my memories?
no !
don't ...
don't do it !
don't ...
don't ...
no ... no ...
she's improved greatly since her last visit .
in other tests as well absolutely no symptoms of leukemia were found .
but this is a bit strange .
there's always a slight difference between actual age and physical age .
but in soo hyun's case , her bone density has dropped alarmingly over the past few days .
what does that mean?
soo hyun is currently aging very quickly .
it's because of the wig .
there's a ghost in the wig .
is there anything else?
in cases like this , it's harder for the people watching over her .
did soo hyun say anything ...?
it might be better to keep soo hyun in the hospital a while .
she is absolutely refusing to see ji hyun .
teacher .
did i ... happen to leave my camera in your studio?
yes , you did .
there's some film inside it .
i'd like to see those pictures .
okay , i'll develop them for you .
right now ...
quickly .
snap out of it , and look at me .
the police are searching so they'll find her soon .
she's not at home so she must be in the hospital .
i'll look for her , so wait here .
they say hair lives off people's memories ...
the old woman kept saying that she could see something .
it's called " jang " .
the factory that supplied her with wigs .
people say they used dead people's hair to make wigs .
they took hair from someone who committed suicide .
rumors say the factory owner died while making a wig out of it .
he had a daughter , but no one knows what happened to her .
assorted wigs " jang
soo hyun ...
soo hyun ...
i'm scared ...
i'm scared ...
i'm so scared ...
this hair is alive .
we should never have made that wig .
is this from a dead body?
that night ,
he ... he ... died ...
i liked him so much .
that hee ju , i liked him so much .
the two of them loved each other .
two men ...
she's really mysterious looking ...
who is it?
no one special .
there's no other dress in the world like this one .
thank you .
but did you get plastic surgery?
i worried about the change in her face ...
soo hyun's changed a lot .
teacher .
it's me , hee ju .
soo hyun ...
i'm hee ju , not soo hyun .
feel me .
i'm not a man anymore .
you're not hee ju .
hee ju's dead .
i'm alive right now .
i've waited so long for this moment .
i so wanted to reveal myself to you ...
hee ju , it's no use .
let soo hyun go that body isn't yours .
you liked me .
you loved me !
i loved you ...
but ...
love is for one person only !
and it never wavers .
i love you , teacher .
get away from him !
you want to speak in a pretty voice .
you want to say i love you .
hee ju , no ...
you bitch !
ji hyun ...
do you know what love is?
it's remembering ...
my hair ... !
my hair !
my hair ... !
no , no , no !
my hair ... !
my hair !
no ...
no , no , no !
no ...
no , no , no !
no ...
no , no !
no ...
no , no !
no , no !
no ...
it's all over now .
it's all over .
ji hyun ...
my hair keeps growing ...
ji hyun ...
what's wrong?
i'm soo hyun .
no ...
you're not soo hyun .
i'm scared , ji hyun ...
ji hyun , i'm sick ...
i need my medicine ...
ji hyun ...
at the amusement park ...
do you remember the balloons
dad bought us?
as we fought over the prettier color ,
the balloon flew up to the sky .
i cried , and so did you ...
so you told me ...
later , when i'm grown up , you'd put wings on me .
so i could go to the sky ...
and find the balloon .
ji hyun ...
thank you for the wings .
ji hyun?
listen closely .
soo hyun wasn't taking her pills .
probably she did it for your sake , so she could look healthier .
the pills are strong , so if you stop taking them for a short time you look healthy .
her hair may have grown back too .
it was looking hopeful ...
if she stops taking the pills the cancer can return .
so bring soo hyun back to the hospital right away , understand?
