that's a good lead .
i know .
we found a hair .

i want it all back .
you got it all from the insurance company .
i want my money back .
the money that your husband and his 10 friends stole from me .
with interest .
a hundred and sixty million dollars over three years .
that's a lot of vig .
and i want it all back .
he's got two weeks .
you'll never find them .
they're way too smart for you .
right .
you know , as it turns out ... ... l'm not the only person in the world looking for ocean's 11 .
all right .
i'm the groom , and i'm not supposed to say anything , but ...
make a speech .
but i don't care what the rules are , because i really wanna thank my family .
my mom and dad , my uncle gary and aunt grace .
uncle ted , aunt celeste ... ... and their children , denise and jessica .
bishop tom and his wife , helen , my neighbor john ... ... and his new girlfriend , tanya .
and all the guys at lean machine inc . , bobo , mullethead ... ... big sam .

thank you .
excuse me , everybody .
i'd just like to ...
get up .
get up .
get up .
get up .
get up .
walk .
walk .
i'd like to say a few words about commitment ... ... about honor ... ... about responsibility ... ... about a very special someone and admitting to her ...
get up .
pull the chair out .
admitting to her in front of everybody ... ... that her wedding ... ... and that very special honeymoon trip to epcot center ... ... will have to be postponed .
the photographer .
jesus , he's just a friend .
you met him at the mint , remember?
well , of course i am .
you don't expect me to embarrass myself by flying commercial?
on a budget?
on a budget?
who was the only person who couldn't get in on the chinese cell phone market?
you , with all your connections .
what was that?
he seemed really nice .
and you know it's hard for guys to be friends with me .
and you do this every time that i meet someone new .
and you know what?
it's getting really boring .
you think it's a accident no one know about fred " bud " kelly?
ain't no accident .
there's one explanation ... ... and you ladies know exactly what it is .
i'm gonna tell you what it is .
conspiracy , collusion , complicity .
that's all it is .
let me break it down like a fraction for you about my man fred " bud " kelly .
fred " bud " kelly made skates out of whiskey bottles ... ... at his uncle's farm in the early 1900s .
that was over there in nova scotia .
i'm gonna tell you something else .
you never seen his name on the stanley cup .
you know why that is?
because that son of a bitch jim crow ... ... took his name off the history books .
you kind of ...
seems like every time i see you , you're playing the race card , frank .
now , why is that?
you can let go of my feet now .
this don't bother you?
of course it ******* bothers me , mate .
what the **** do you want me to do?
well , it's ****** up .
you can't hear none of the lyrics .
you can't get with the beat with all them ******* bleeps in it .
you want a ******* single on the ******* radio , it's what you have to ******* do .
well , it's ****** , isn't it?
totally ****** ! ******* right , it's ************* .
what the **** is that?
somebody must be in 2 .
oh , **** !
and you haven't contacted my father about any of this?
because , really , i don't think there's any reason to involve him or my mom .
it's all on you , linus .
okay .
good .
good .
because i have a whole network ...
get out of my car .
thank you .
mr. bloom?
yes .
there appears to be a slight problem with your card .
oh , well , yes .
here .
i'm afraid not , sir .
why?
your business manager said you would understand .
todd said i would understand?
no , mr. benedict .
mr. benedict .
mr ...
oh , yes .
an old friend , a practical joker .
tell mr. benedict he's won this round , yes .
terry benedict .
old terry .
she's looking at me from across the room .
and she's crazy about me , i can tell ... ... because she's been staring at me all night .
so suddenly ... ... i just go up to her , and i grab her .
and i've got her really close to me ... ... and her eyes are all fiery .
and my eyes are fiery .
and it's like ...
it's electric .
and i say to her , " mom ...
mother ...
what?
thanks for letting me finish .
what can i say?
you're a funny guy .
oh , yeah .
my friend rusty .
i'm worried about him .
he owns this hotel in los angeles ... ... losing a lot of money , and he's got no life .
he's a nice , bright kid , but he's beating his brains out .
do you think i could send something through you , like , a message to him?
i read your palm , not his .
somebody who could do that could do very well .
anything on my health?
my hips are bothering me .
please .
this?
you couldn't see this?
i tried knocking , he won't open .
i'll handle it .
i know him .
jesus christ , are you people retarded?
it says , " do not disturb " !
it's me .
hey .
come on in .
jeez , topher , you didn't have to go all frankie muniz on me .
i'm sorry .
rust , look , i know this is your joint .
i just ...
there's this girl .
i love her , man .
i love her , but she is driving me crazy !
i can't sleep .
i can't work .
i quit the show .
i totally phoned in that dennis quaid movie .
i mean , it's like ...
hello?
god , it's almost like this kabbalah crap doesn't even work !
rusty , call for you .
dude , don't leave .
yeah?
i have a message for robert charles ryan ... ... soon to be ex owner of the standard hotel .
you got him .
last time we spoke , you hung up on me .
you used some nasty words .
i got sensitive ears .
i admit i was a little emotional that evening .
think about that night a lot , don't you?
i thought i'd be dead before i heard the sound that killed me .
i've been asked to show restraint .
otherwise , you would've gone out ... ... to your favorite car of all the 17 you own , and as soon as you turned on the ignition ...
you got two weeks .
now , you told me that your wife said that he called it ocean's 11 .
now , who decided that?
i'm a private contractor .
it was a collaboration .
that moniker is insulting .
it was one job we did together .
i don't know where this proprietary stance comes from .
it seems possessive .
one could make the argument that because it was danny's idea ...
hang on a minute .
we all had our own areas of expertise .
i mean , without us , it don't leave your head , mate .
it just hurts , you know , because ... ... it seemed we all agreed to call it " the benedict job .
that's what we called it when we were doing it .
if you wanted to call it something else ... when you have a problem , who do you go to?
rusty .
rusty .
thanks .
let's get back on the topic .
based on what we stole , plus interest ... ... how much does everybody owe? $17 . 34 million .
assuming benedict gives us prime plus one , which i doubt .
figure 19 to be safe .
okay , 19 each .
anybody got that?
what , you think the stock market's some great mystery ... ... beyond the realm of human understanding?
didn't you see the signs?
i saw the signs .
how much is everybody short?
how much you short?
fourteen .
fourteen .
all but 5 million?
yeah .
you gonna start with me?
you don't know what it's like to create something from scratch .
well , with interest , i'm short 7 .
eight .
i spent about a million , mostly on talent development .
that makes it 7 for me .
boy , the interest just kills you .
i'm light 9 .
what's the interest?
about 6 .
then i owe 6 .
how?
what?
i've been staying at my parents '.
i owe 25 .
hotels , man .
saul?
i haven't spent it all , but i will .
i'm out , fellas .
as ranking old timer , i gotta say , i just can't do it .
at my age , i think i earned the right to be selfish .
i wanna thank you all for the wonderful opportunity .
you're all aces in my book .
but i want the last check i write to bounce .
saul , you having a laugh?
saul .
i can handle saul's share .
you don't have to .
who would i talk to if you were all dead?
that's a good point .
all right , i owe 10 .
amazing?
yeah , but it's a nice place .
so that comes to ...?
ninety seven , give or take .
he didn't find us on his own .
someone helped him .
another thief .
nobody we know would violate rule number one .
what we do know is we need a job .
we need a high paying job .
we're too hot to work anywhere in this country .
so we go abroad .
how about we go ...?
we're on the 5 : 00 .
good .
where are we going?
amsterdam .
amsterdam it is .
clock's running .
let's go .
never been to amsterdam .
i hear german girls are really hot .
rusty .
amsterdam?
yeah .
don't tell danny .
hey , rusty .
rusty .
sorry , sorry .
hey .
what are you doing?
what's wrong with you?
nothing .
what?
can i ...?
can i ...?
what?
just for a second , can i talk to you?
what's wrong?
i just ...
i don't know .
this might not be the perfect time or whatever to talk about it .
okay .
i've been thinking .
i've been doing my homework .
and i'd really like ... ... to play a more central role this time around .
right .
i feel like i've ...
right .
i'm ready for that , and i ... way overdue .
i was wondering if i could come to the meeting and help you guys negotiate .
okay .
it's just a sit down with matsui .
he's got his own language , this guy .
i watched you and danny really closely last time around .
i learned a ton .
linus , in my professional opinion , you're not ready .
okay .
yeah , i mean ...
but ...
but ...
but ... ... if you're convinced you are ready ... ... i can speak with danny .
we can make this happen .
but you gotta be sure .
not sure?
no , i am .
you're sure?
but if i had a question , i could ...
you would call me?
right .
okay .
any time .
okay .
okay .
all right .
okay .
awesome .
thank you .
yeah .
i almost wasn't gonna come over and say anything .
then i'd still be sleeping .
thanks , buddy .
yeah .
who's there?
li ...
it's ...
what?
it's linus .
is rusty here?
rusty ...?
do you know where rusty is?
no .
so have you met matsui?
seriously , what do you think of me ... ... you know , in terms of just leadership potential?
the fact that we're unemployable shouldn't enter your mind .
otherwise , you're wasting time .
don't mention benedict unless he does first .
and if he does , tell him everything .
right .
stay on point .
and don't forget the other thing i told you .
what?
about listening .
relax .
remember , if we don't get this job , we're dead .
rusty , i tried calling you all yesterday .
hey , maybe that's why i've been feeling so warm recently .
yeah .
so to business?
to business .
a doctor who specializes in skin diseases ... ... will dream he has fallen asleep in front of the television .
later , he will wake up in front of the television ... ... but not remember his dream .
would you agree?
if all the animals along the equator were capable of flattery ... ... then thanksgiving and halloween ... ... would fall on the same date .
yeah .
hey .
when i was 4 years old ... ... i watched my mother kill a spider with a tea cozy .
years later , i realized it was not a spider .
it was my uncle harold .
oh , let the sun beat down upon my face
stars to fill my dreams
i am a traveler in both time and space
to be where i have been
is he all right?
are we all right?
" kashmir "?
is that your idea of making a contribution?
we hadn't even started yet .
we were this close to losing that .
okay , i don't even understand what happened in there .
what did i say?
you called his niece a whore .
a cheap one .
she's 7 .
confined to bed with a case of ...
no , don't tell him about it .
i'm sorry .
okay .
so , what does this mean?
it means you stay here .
the mark's name is van der woude .
a semi known , wealthy recluse .
he claims to sell antiques , but hasn't actually sold one .
his store is his privately owned home , which no one ever enters .
but don't let van der woude's eccentricity fool you .
the house is extremely well protected .
what are we after?
it's a document .
it's a very old , very valuable document .
yeah , what is it?
a stock certificate .
the first one ever issued from the first corporation on the planet .
dutch east india trading company .
the only one of its kind .
what's the take?
2 . 5 million euro .
wait .
each?
no .
who negotiated this?
that's a lot of money to a lot of people .
are you out of your mind?
if we do one job a week at that rate , we won't pay benedict off until ...
september 2005 .
jesus christ , danny .
i hear you , but it's what's available .
after we pull this job off ... ... matsui's gonna throw us another .
it's gonna pay 10 times this one .
which will buy an extension from benedict .
you hope .
i hope .
now , the good news is that matsui gave us the system's master code .
so , what are we waiting for?
van der woude .
that's the bad news .
he never leaves .
he's agoraphobic .
he's never been out of his house?
not in 10 years since he moved in .
does he believe in fresh air?
he opens his window .
what does that mean?
best time of arrival .
means he opens his window .
every night at 1 : 30 he takes an ambien , puts on beethoven's third .
by the fourth movement , he's out like a light .
so we go in at 3 a . m .
okay , can we tap into the system from the phone lines?
it's a closed loop system with two servers locked in titanium cases next to his bed .
so hacking in is out .
look at this .
telephone repair truck , basket up to the second floor .
telescoping rod through the window , tap out the freak's code .
dumb idea .
one lane , one way streets .
dumb idea .
all right?
any stoppage will bring cops .
the outside is covered by five surveillance cameras .
monitored 24 hours a day by a security company .
he's got five exterior cameras?
this guy is a freak .
super freak .
what about through the roof?
two more cameras , pressure sensors ...
a laser net over the trap door ...
smoke the freak out .
yeah .
smoke the freak out .
hey !
what?
do we have to use that term?
what term?
" freak .
the national institute of mental health estimates 5 . 6 percent of adults ... ... develop " agraphoriaphobia .
agoraphobia .
whatever .
i'm just saying , i mean , do we ...?
we don't need to be an organization that labels people .
oh , now we're an organization?
you'd call emily dickinson a freak?
are you hosting a telethon?
who's emily dickinson?
am i the only one who feels funny about stealing from a ...?
you know , a handicapped guy?
well , i don't care .
hell , yeah .
i feel funny about other things .
cool .
but ...
yeah?
but ...
right .
what?
ahab with a piggyback .
livingston?
i can get anything .
it's done .
ahab with what?
boys .
you're making that up .
that's ...
that whole " ahab with a piggyback , " that's not real?
let me in .
how do you think it feels ... ... when someone bangs on the door?
i gotta go to the toilet .
otherwise , i'm gonna shit on your feet .
come on .
show me them specs .
i've been doing this since i'm 12 years old .
you're micromanaging .
you gotta find people you can delegate to .
otherwise , you'll never have a life .
i don't want a life .
i want the hotel to run like a hotel should .
reuben .
yeah .
great .
okay .
good .
maybe .
fantastic .
remember in miller's crossing where turturro begs for his life?
sure .
look into your heart .
i cry every time .
what?
we have no line of sight .
our only possibility , the window .
we're three inches too high .
there's no clear shot , even with basher .
in the physical universe we occupy , it cannot be done .
what about the guy from the bulgari job?
nagel .
spoke with him .
anything?
lot of ideas , none of them any good .
he's pushing this new holographic technology .
really interesting stuff , though .
he can reproduce anything 3 d.
how about 97 million?
we're forcing it .
yeah , we're forcing it .
you know what we haven't thought of?
what?
we turn ourselves in .
what could benedict do to us then?
there you go .
call the cops , tell them we did the bellagio job .
they put us away for 20 years .
that'd teach him .
i think tess would stick around .
you look great in jumpsuits .
hey ... ... how's the hotel business?
sucks .
how's east haven?
sucks .
i don't know .
can't turn my brain off , you know .
it's me .
we go into some place , and all i can do is see the angles .
it's what i do .
it's what i've always done .
i love it .
i don't know .
some sort of weird irony , you know?
tess watching me scratch and itch .
hey , listen .
you know , the world's gone nuts and you're ...
what'd you wanna do?
it's not attached to the adjacent buildings .
the whole house?
we're just raising it slightly .
schumann did it in '64 in venice and '73 in istanbul .
he only had a crew of six .
we can't tilt a house .
did it with the leaning tower of pizza .
exactly , thank you .
it took 300 men over two years to do it .
there's 30 pylons .
we cut them , insert the jacks and crank away .
it's really our best plan , considering it's our only plan .
crank for how long?
like i said , it's our only plan .
what?
oh , oh , okay , hold on .
try that .
number five .
i'm a go .
master thieves who practice the long con live separate lives as civilians .
they have legitimate jobs and families ... ... which make them extremely difficult to catch .
the greatest thief of all time was , without question ... ... gaspar lemarc , who either died in portugal in 1988 ... ... or in hong kong in 1996 , or he's still alive .
we may never know for certain , because lemarc ... ... was never captured or photographed ... ... despite being active for over 50 years .
the thief we know only as the night fox .
so named for the small onyx figurines he leaves behind to taunt us ... ... the night fox must be considered our number one priority .
his string of high profile crimes are an embarrassment to our branch ... ... to our entire profession .
we need more than traditional resources to pursue thieves like the night fox .
we need to train ourselves to think the way they think , to see what they see .
and we should not allow ourselves to be distracted ...
i'm sorry .
someone just robbed the van der woude house .
what?
hi , isabel .
well , we could really use your help on this one .
i hope the scene hasn't been contaminated .
when can i speak to mr. van der woude?
probably tomorrow .
he's heavily sedated .
we can't figure out how they disabled the alarm .
shorted it out somehow?
no , that would have triggered the system and damaged the circuits .
well , then .
then i don't know how they got in .
they had the code .
someone other than the owner must have known it .
impossible .
van der woude programmed the last nine steps of the system .
he set it and never left the house again .
closed loop .
redundant servers .
titanium encasement .
it's not bad , actually .
yeah .
thanks .
do we know each other?
i think i saw you yesterday .
oh , yeah?
yeah , you were being chased by the police .
chasing me?
no .
i don't think so .
i'm quite sure it was you .
doesn't say much for the police .
no , i love rome .
i love it .
but there's an opening at work the level above me , and it's ...
i was thinking i was gonna try out for it .
it's in amsterdam .
my mother has family there , so it'd be ...
it'd be good .
he lifted the whole house?
the whole house .
the entire house?
the entire house .
it's called a schumann special ... ... named after this guy , a brilliant guy , max schumann .
then he did it in istanbul in 1973 .
what is it?
it's where the crossbow bolt hit .
the crossbow bolt?
they fired from that rooftop through this open window .
with a crossbow bolt from that roof through that window?
that's a very difficult shot .
no , it is an impossible shot ... ... until they raised the building .
check the pylons .
they'll be elevated .
you know the name max schumann?
no .
well , they do .
who?
the americans .
wait a minute .
exactly .
why would they bring the drill if they weren't planning to use it?
what?
oh , god .
what?
i don't know .
congratulations .
you are the second person to crack the van der woude safe tonight .
in arriving second , mr. ocean , you have joined a long line ... ... of people who've worked hard and risked a great deal only to get somewhere second .
you don't know these people by name , of course , because they enter oblivion .
you know this word , " oblivion "?
it means to be totally forgotten by everyone forever .
and it's where you would be now if it weren't for the bellagio heist .
how does this guy know who we are?
in a way , i'm responsible for you coming to amsterdam in the first place .
i hired matsui , and matsui hired you .
that's the guy who dimed us to benedict .
all of them , including ocean .
yes .
i find that hard to believe .
and you are?
you can call me the night fox .
the night fox .
okay , mr. night fox .
what will this information cost me?
don't worry .
nothing .
nothing?
who do you think you're dealing with?
nothing costs nothing .
and this information is definitely worth something .
let's just say our interests are temporarily aligned .
how so?
well , the information is free , but it comes with certain conditions .
such as?
restraint on your part .
restraint?
that's asking a lot .
what else?
two weeks to buy themselves out of trouble .
two weeks?
i can live with that , even if they can't .
just out of curiosity , what will you make them pay?
for letting them live?
everything they stole , plus interest .
a lot of interest .
but didn't your insurance cover what was stolen?
of course .
so you're asking them to double your money?
well , do you really think that's fair?
fair?
i certainly hope not .
so , what about the information?
okay .
it's on your desk .
he was here .
around 3 : 30 this morning .
i can tell .
who?
the night fox .
go down to the dampkring and pick up a guy called matsui .
real name , lan nicolas mcnally .
the night fox was here at the same time as the americans?
why?
that's what we're gonna find out .
what is he doing?
get him out of there .
god .
hello , frank .
i can't understand what we did to this guy .
why does he have it out for us like this?
how did he get that code?
doesn't matter .
he broke rule number one .
he's on the list .
great time for a turf war .
i spoke with frank's associate in dublin .
she's trying to get us a name on this guy .
our train leaves tomorrow at 1 : 38 , okay?
where is frank?
i don't know .
it's gonna get out .
then we'll be dead , and no one will wanna work with us .
housekeeping .
turndown service for mr. ryan .
hi .
nice room .
you have it all to yourself?
you here to take me in?
why would i do that?
it's not as if you stole something .
it's nice to see you again , robert .
you too .
of course , you've been seeing plenty of me , haven't you?
i like this one .
i call it " thief la mode .
schumann special , huh?
i guess that's what i get for opening my mouth .
so , what about the night fox?
did he leave you a message?
what about the figurine?
you still have it?
i suppose it's a compliment in a way .
i guess he's threatened by you , though i can't imagine why .
you have no idea what you're up against .
the french police think he's better than lemarc .
well , he is french .
let me give you some advice .
find out how you offended him .
apologize .
beg for mercy .
got to go .
any message for frank?
he's been hanging around the station .
on what charge?
well , we found a print of a size 14 hi tec magnum boot at the crime scene .
and?
bought with a fraudulent credit card .
from that point on , well , there's only one , maybe two great nail salons in amsterdam .
and you lied to us .
yeah , and to me .
well , frank knew .
frank knew you were in touch?
i wasn't in touch .
i was more like keeping tabs .
she's a cop !
detective , actually .
where'd she learn all that schumann crap?
dad .
what , he was a cop?
thief .
oh , god .
was he good?
oh , yeah .
great .
pissed off ex girlfriend whose thief father ... ... taught her every trick in the book .
well , she just made danny and yen .
in the next 48 hours , your pictures will be in every police station .
nobody looks at them .
nobody but cops .
detectives .
you'd think she'd have sympathy for us ... ... if her old man was a thief .
is that sympathy or empathy?
no , her old man got popped a day before her 9th birthday .
died in jail .
so i wouldn't count on much sympathy .
or empathy .
she's gonna have the hotel under surveillance .
great .
we'll just eat room service , watch movies and wait for benedict to kill us .
who's on the $100 bill?
adams .
john travolta .
he said every problem ... ... is an opportunity in disguise .
he couldn't say that with a . 45 in his mouth .
no , you're missing the silver lining here .
now , she gave us a name , didn't she?
the night fox .
one phone call , we're gonna find out everything there is to know about this guy .
the name is m. diaz .
d l a z.
it's a black duffel bag .
the team's in rotterdam .
the bag's in brussels .
disconnected , frightened ... ... paranoid , but with good reason .
it's too sad to be funny .
unusable .
i think i can get 20 minutes out of it .
great .
i got it .
the team's in barcelona .
the bag's in madrid .
this is a moral issue we're dealing with here .
and we don't have a grease man anymore , because he's in a bag somewhere .
we got a bag man .
such an ape .
an animal with no feelings .
i have feelings .
no , you don't .
i feel bad for the guy .
he's in a piece of luggage , but he's got water .
what did you want them to do?
get off the bus .
and pick up the bag with our friend in it .
how many pro soccer teams are fielding 50 year old men?
rusty's not 50 years old .
yeah , dude , we know rusty's not 50 .
you think i'm 50 years old?
let me ask you something .
no , wait , let me ask you something .
how old do you think i am?
forty eight .
you think i'm 48 years old?
fifty two?
maybe he should've asked me .
nobody should ever ask you anything .
that guy doesn't have a hard enough life right now?
you gotta ...
you're gonna defend him?
they put yen in a handbag .
can i ask you something?
ever notice ...?
yes .
okay , can i ask ...?
yes .
you ever notice that tess looks exactly ...?
don't ever ask that .
seriously .
not to anyone .
especially not to her .
wait .
why not?
look .
it's not in my nature to be mysterious ... ... but i can't talk about it , and i can't talk about why .
can i ask you ...?
do i look 50 to you?
yeah .
really?
well , i mean , only from the neck up .
saul?
what's the matter?
nothing .
you wanna go out?
it's nice .
no .
you wanna watch something?
the game's on .
no .
you hungry?
i'll heat something up .
no .
saul , ever since you got back , you've been acting strange .
what did danny want?
nothing .
nothing?
how could he want nothing?
all right , the night fox has a name .
franois toulour .
baron franois toulour .
father was a french industrialist , mother was italian nobility .
he never met her , but he inherited her title .
the bad news is he's rich , he's bored and he's talented .
the really bad news is he was trained by lemarc .
this is not good .
with the lemarc?
gaspar lemarc?
that's the one .
well , we're doomed .
we're not doomed .
he's one guy , and he's french .
yeah .
before we get too impressed by his background ... ... let's hear what he's done .
he started in the '90s .
bank of geneva , the danish treasury , the bank of italy , amc amro ... ... the brussels diamond exchange , antwerp diamond exchange .
wait , wait .
all those in the 1990s?
i'm only up to '96 .
seriously?
in '97 , he went through an art phase .
he hit the tate in london , the louvre in paris , twice , and the prado .
wait .
no , no , hang on .
the prado museum in '97?
that was moretti .
everybody knows that ...
he is moretti .
it's one of his aliases .
okay , i'll skip to my favorite .
in 2002 , he stole the king of morocco's 200 foot yacht .
vanished into thin air .
crew surfaced days later in a life raft .
couldn't remember a thing .
how do you hide a 200 foot yacht?
lf the king knows , he's not telling .
he got it back a month later .
he now plays tennis with toulour every weekend .
we're in some serious trouble here .
copy that .
so , what do we do?
we respond .
respond?
how?
in kind .
mr. ocean .
you broke rule number one , and that has consequences .
oh , you must be talking about the paintings .
don't worry .
you'll be dead in five days , and i'll get my paintings back .
unless you have an accident first .
i don't think so , daniel .
perhaps i should explain to you why i'm tormenting you .
i'd like that .
last month i was in portugal to see my mentor .
lemarc .
indeed .
a very loud and annoying american businessman was there the same day .
he worked for a big insurance company .
he's the one who suggested benedict to you as a potential mark .
you know the man?
what about him?
he said it was the most beautiful job he'd ever seen .
he went on and on about this job , and then he said ... ... it showed you were the greatest thief in the world .
but the worst part is that lemarc never corrected him .
i told lemarc that you can't be better than me .
and he answered that it was impossible to know for sure .
so i thought about that for , like , three weeks in a row , day and night .
and then suddenly , i realized that he was actually right .
it is impossible to compare one theft to the other .
so i guess the only way to know who's the best of us for sure ... ... is to go after the same object .
do the same job .
don't you think that would be fun?
you're being awfully cavalier with a lot of people's lives so you can play out a game .
you're gonna regret it .
come on , mr. ocean .
how are you gonna possibly get $97 million by next wednesday?
especially if every safe you crack between now and then is already empty?
whereas if you accept my challenge and win ... ... i promise i'll pay your debt to benedict ... ... and lemarc will hold my money in escrow as a guarantee .
what are we stealing?
the famous faberg coronation egg .
was that your idea or lemarc's?
i think he would agree ... ... that it's the most appropriate thing for us to compete over .
where is it located?
the egg left paris this morning on its way to rome .
it travels with heavy security and usually with one or more replicas .
sometimes they even show the replicas without anybody knowing .
when the egg goes on display monday morning ... ... you'll have 48 hours to steal it before your deadline's up .
when the deadline passes and you don't have the egg ... ...
lemarc will know who's the best .
rusty's phone .
who is this?
nicole .
who's this?
nagel .
where's rusty?
he said if you called , to say he was at gunther's .
gunther's?
what's that about?
did he say something?
do you have a message?
yes , i do .
tell him this thing is gonna cost him double what i told him .
and tell him i had to go three times as thin on the layers .
and tell him if he wants it tomorrow , it should cost him more than double .
and tell him this thing is beautiful .
would fool the bloody romanovs themselves .
and tell him i'm being a nice guy .
and tell him he dresses like a gigolo .
is that it?
yeah .
no .
tell him having a sexy female assistant ... ... is such a terrible clich .
can i get a coffee or something?
thanks .
just a cappuccino or espresso .
well ...
you call me on saturday and ask me to come into my office ... ... and sign a 1077 ... ... and you can't even tell me what they are after?
i can come to your house .
i'm leaving for naples in two hours .
we'll talk about this on wednesday .
it'll be gone by wednesday .
what?
what?
what will be gone?
something worth signing a 1077 for .
ryan and his friends did the bellagio casino heist in 2001 .
i am telling you , this is serious ...
lf that's true ... ... then we should call the american fbl ...
no , no , no .
maurizio , listen to me .
agent lahiri ... ... a 1077 is not a small thing .
unless you can tell me what they are after , there is no point in discussing it .
hey ...
because lemarc stole it in 1980 when 23 others failed .
because the night fox is trying to prove he's better than ryan and his friends .
this is ridiculous .
you say the egg will be stolen .
then you say lemarc already stole it 24 years ago .
which one is it?
both .
what?
lemarc's wife made him put the egg back .
when i signed a 1077 for you on the bulgari case ... ... you requisitioned 30 of my men for three months and made zero arrests .
i won't do it again .
first , we cannot go at night .
the laser grid in the great hall's impossible to beat .
nothing's impossible .
this is impossible .
it's in constant motion , programmed to improvise randomly ... ... meaning we can't plan our way through .
all right .
so it's a daytime play .
we're still short three on the inside since isabel made you and yen and danny .
we could try a smuggler's paradise .
it hasn't worked since the '50s .
'54 , actually .
what's option two?
baby jane , squeaky wheel , followed by a number two son .
it's complicated , but it's got a high success rate .
the only problem is ...
we can't do it without a grease man on the inside , without yen .
we'll have to risk it .
we'll put him in disguise .
10 : 10 , i leave the caf , proceed west .
10 : 11?
i enter the second floor bathroom .
10 : 13?
approach the spanish steps from the south .
basher and i enter by the main entrance .
10 : 15?
i help yen into the ventilation duct .
10 : 18?
i move reuben to the egg room .
i pause in the great hall while ...
i go to the egg room .
10 : 21?
yen enters the mainframe room .
he cuts power to grid 14 a.
he radios me .
i signal linus .
i then go to the egg room .
10 : 22?
i drop my keys and move reuben to his mark .
i blind camera one .
i blind camera two .
i blind camera three .
camera four .
i make the switch .
right .
10 : 24?
i pull to the corner of the main entrance .
i meet danny at the steps .
we head north .
10 : 25?
turk and i make the drop .
all right .
really good stuff , guys .
really good work .
all right , we'll pick it up here in an hour .
it's a slam dunk .
great .
10 : 45 , we all get arrested .
you bet .
how was toulour?
he was predictable .
you hear from nagel?
he'll be here .
that's a lot to presume from a guy like nagel .
follow it up .
this is isabel .
it's johan .
i just set a 6 : 00 meeting for you with an andre ciment ... ... who says he had four paintings stolen from his house in lake como .
and when was this?
sometime friday .
he's missing two monets , a turner and a degas .
which degas was it?
blue dancers .
supposedly , there's surveillance video , but i haven't been able to confirm that yet .
it is all about error correction .
three thousand separate , translucent , digital slivers ... ... instead of the 1000 i thought it would be .
thank god it doesn't have to move .
re creating the lighting was a pain .
it's a mixture of tungsten and real light .
