it's stiii on , and we're going .
cyrus sent an emissary this afternoon to make sure .
now , cyrus don't want anybody packed .
he don't want anybody flexing any muscle .
i gave him my word that the warriors would uphold the truce .
everybody says that cyrus is the one and only .
i think we'd better go have a iook for ourself .
we ain't been to the bronx before .
no sweat .
this conclave's gonna be a reai big item .
every gang in the city is gonna be there .
we're going in with nothing .
we're going in there iike everybody else .
nine guys , no weapons .
you got the stuff?
i want you to hit everything in sight .
i want everybody to know the warriors were there .
you never know what's out there .
wearing our colors , we can't hide .
who wants to hide?
maybe we'ii get to waste a few heads along the way .
you just soldier and keep your mouth shut .
when we get there , you stick close by , okay?
don't worry .
i don't feei iike getting wrecked .
one thing we might get out of cyrus 'iittle get together ... ... is meeting some strange wool .
i wouldn't mind iaying something down on the way back .
you got a one track brain , you know that?
what's the matter?
you going faggot?
what do you know about cyrus?
magic .
a whole iot of magic .
what do you know about cyrus?
he's the one and only .
when you're president of the biggest gang in the city , you don't have to take any shit .
fuck him .
i'ii teii you something , i'ii bet nobody's even gonna be there .
can you count , suckers? !
i say the future is ours ... ... if you can count !
come on , cyrus , we're with you !
go ahead , bro !
now , iook what we have here before us .
we've got the saracens ... ... sitting next to the jones street boys .
we've got the moon runners ... ... right by the van courtland rangers .
nobody is wasting nobody .
that ... ... is a miracle .
and miracles is the way things ought to be .
yeah !
i heard that !
i heard that .
come get answered !
you're standing right now with nine delegates from 1 00 gangs .
and there's over 1 00 more .
that's 20, 000 hard core members .
forty thousand , counting affiliates , and 20, 000 more , not organized but ready to fight .
sixty thousand soldiers .
now , there ain't but 20, 000 police in the whole town .
can you dig it?
can you dig it?
can you dig it?
yeah !
now here's the sum total .
one gang could run this city .
one gang .
nothing would move without us ailowing it to happen .
we could tax the crime syndicates , the police , because we got the streets , suckers !
can you dig it?
right on !
the problem in the past has been the man turning us against one another .
we have been unable to see the truth , because we've been fighting for 1 0 square feet of ground , our turf , our iittle piece of turf .
that's crap , brothers .
the turf is ours by right because it's our turn .
aii we have to do is keep up the generai truce .
we take over one borough at a time .
secure our territory , secure our turf because it's aii our turf .
the other way , against the crowd !
and keep your ass down !
down !
get out of the way .
they'ii kiii us ail .

fucking coney island must be 50 to 1 00 miles from here .
it's the only choice we got .
yeah , reai simple .
except that every cop in the city is iooking to bust our heads .
we got something to think about .
yeah?
what?
the truce .
is it stiii on?
if it ain't , we're gonna have to bop our way back .
shit , i wish we was packed .
if this truce is off , anything could hit us between here and that train .
if you get separated , make it to the platform at union square .
that's where we change trains .
who named you ieader?
i got as much right to take over as you .
it was cleon's choice .
swan's war chief .
