# looking out a dirty , old window??
outside the cars in the city go rushing by??
i sit here alone , and i wonder why??
friday night and everyone's moving??
i can feel the heat??
but it's soothing??
heading down??
i search for the beat in this dirty town??
downtown , the young ones are going??
downtown , the young ones are growing??
we're the kids in america??
we're the kids in america??
so , o. k. , you're probably going ,
is this , like , a noxema commercial or what?
but seriously ,
i actually have a way normal life for a teenage girl .
i mean , i get up , i brush my teeth .
and i pick out my school clothes .
?
they do it over there??
but we don't do it here??
ooh , bop??
fashion??
fashion??
turn to the left??
fashion??
turn to the right??
ooh , fashion??
daddy's a litigator .
those are the scariest kinds of lawyers .
even lucy , our maid , is terrified of him .
and daddy is so good , he gets $500 an hour to fight with people .
he fights with me for free .
daddy !
cher , please don't start with the juice again .
daddy , you need your vitamin c.
where's my briefcase?
it's been a couple months now .
let's go to malibu .
don't tell me those lowlifes have been calling again .
they are your parents .
don't sneak out of the office .
dr. lovett's giving you a flu shot .
josh is coming for dinner .
why?
he's your stepbrother !
you were hardly married to his mother .
why do i have to see josh?
you divorce wives , not children .
here .
forget it !
did i show you the loqued out jeep daddy got me?
it's got four wheel drive , dual side airbags , and a monster sound system .
i don't have a license yet , but i need something to learn on .
boy !
that came out of nowhere !
here's where dionne lives .
she's my friend because we both know what it's like to have people jealous of us .
girlfriend !
i must give her snaps for her courageous fashion efforts .
hey , cher .
dionne and i were both named after great singers of the past who now do infomercials .
so?
been shopping with dr. seuss?
i wouldn't skin a collie for a backpack .
it's faux .
hello !
that was a stop sign .
i totally paused .
yeah .
o. k.
it's not even 8 : 30 , and murray is paging me .
he is so possessive .
this weekend he called me , and he's all , where were you today?
dionne and her boyfriend murray are in this dramatic relationship .
i think they've seen that lke and tina turner movie just too many times .
now , i have to say to her ...
why do you put up with it?
you could do better .
i know .
shh .
here he comes .
woman , why don't you be answering any of my pages?
i hate when you call me woman .
where you been all weekend?
you jeepin 'behind my back?
jeepin '.
no !
but speaking of vehicular sex , perhaps you can explain how this kmart hair extension got into the backseat of your car .
i don't know where that came from .
that looks like one of your stringy something or anothers .
i do not wear polyester hair , o. k.?
unlike shawanna .
dee , i'm audi .
bye .
that's it .
i've had it with you .
is it that time of the month again?
i don't know why
dionne's going out with a high school boy .
they're like dogs .
you have to clean them and feed them .
they're just like these nervous creatures that jump and slobber all over you .
ew !
get off of me !
oh , as if !
should all oppressed people be allowed refuge in america?
amber will take the con position .
cher will be pro .
cher , two minutes .
so .
o. k.
like , right now , for example , the haiti ans need to come to america .
some people are all ,
what about the strain on our resources?
like , when i had this garden party for my father's birthday , right?
i said rsvp because it was a sit down dinner .
but people came that , like , did not rsvp , so i was , like , totally buggin '.
i had to haul ass to the kitchen , redistribute the food , squish in extra place settings .
by the end of the day , it was , like , the more the merrier .
so if the government could just get to the kitchen , rearrange some things , we could certainly party with the haiti ans .
may i remind you that it does not say rsvp on the statue of liberty?
whoo !
yeah !
thank you very much .
amber , reply?
mr. hall , how can i answer that?
the topic is haiti , and she's talking about some little party .
hello !
it was his 50th birthday .
whatever .
if she doesn't do the assignment , i can't do mine .
ladies .
so , does anyone have any further thoughts on cher's oration?
elton , comments?
yeah , i can't find my cranberries cd .
i got to go to the quad before somebody snags it .
i'm afraid i can't permit that .
any further insights?
i have an insight , mr. hall .
i'm all ears .
o. k. , like , the way i feel about the rolling stones is the way my kids are going to feel about nine inch nails , so i really shouldn't torment my mom anymore , huh?
yes , well , it's a little off the subject of haiti , but tolerance is always a good lesson .
even when it comes out of nowhere .
and with that in mind ,
i'm going to distribute your report cards .
now , is there a christian stovitz in this class?
mr. hall , the buzz on christian is that his parents have joint custody .
he'll be spending one semester in chicago and one semester here .
i think it is a travesty of the legal profession .
thank you for that perspective , cher .
could all conversations please come to a halt?
and could the suicide attempts please be postponed till the next period?
suddenly , a dark cloud settled over first period .
i got a c in debate?
dee?
did you get your report card?
yeah .
i'm toast .
how did you do?
i totally choked .
my father's going to go ballistic on me .
mr. hall was way harsh .
he gave me a c minus .
he gave me a c , which drags down my entire average .
bye .
i'll call you .
isn't my house classic?
the columns date all the way back to 1972 .
wasn't my mom a betty?
she died when i was just a baby .
a fluke accident during a routine liposuction .
i don't remember her , but i like to pretend she still watches over me .
hey , mom .
98 in geometry .
pretty groovy , huh?
yuck !
the maudlin music of the university station?
wah wah wah !
yuck !
what is it about college and crybaby music?
hey .
who's watching the galleria?
the flannel shirt ...
is that a nod to the crispy seattle weather?
or are you trying to stay warm in front of the refrigerator?
oh , wow , you're filling out there .
oh , wow , your face is catching up with your mouth .
i went by dad's office .
he is not your dad .
go torture a new family .
just because my mother marries someone else doesn't mean he's my father .
that's exactly what it means .
i hope you're not thinking of staying here .
i sure want to .
i got a place near school .
shouldn't you go to school on the east coast?
i hear girls at nyu aren't at all particular .
you're funny .
hey !
you just got here , and already you're playing couch commando .
in some parts of the universe , it's considered cool to know what's going on in the world .
i so need lessons from you on how to be cool .
tell me that part about kenny g. again .
come on , you chuckleheads !
get in here !
josh , are you still growing?
you look taller than you did at easter .
i don't think so .
his head looks bigger .
so , josh , have you given any thought to our discussion about corporate law?
i think i'd like to check out environmental law .
what for?
you want to have a miserable , frustrating life?
josh will have that no matter what he does .
he knows what he wants to do .
he's in a good college .
i'd like to see you have some direction .
i have direction .
yeah .
towards the mall .
where's your report card?
it's not ready yet .
what do you mean it's not ready yet?
some teachers were trying to lowball me , daddy .
you say never accept a first offer .
these grades are a jumping off point to start negotiations .
very good .
dee?
hello?
yeah?
yeah , jake .
what?
no !
not the afternoon !
you are such a brownnoser .
you are such a superficial space cadet .
what makes you think your teachers will change your grades?
only the fact that i've done it every other semester .
i told my p. e. teacher an evil male had broken my heart .
so she raised my c to a b.
they're horrible !
don't feel bad !
and they're all like this .
then i promised miss geist
i'd start a letter writing campaign to my congressman about violations of the clean air act .
but mr. hall was totally rigid .
he said my debates were unresearched , unstructured , and unconvincing .
as if !
i felt impotent and out of control , which i really hate .
i needed to find sanctuary in a place where i could gather my thoughts and regain my strength .
what's wrong?
are you suffering from buyer's remorse or something?
no .
nothing like that .
we've been shopping all day , and i still don't know what to do about mr. hall .
i've tried everything to convince him of my scholastic aptitude , but i was brutally rebuffed .
he's a miserable little man who wants to make everyone else miserable , too .
dee , that's it !
we've got to figure out a way to make mr. hall sublimely happy .
here's the 411 on mr. hall ...
he's single , he's 47 , and he earns minor ducats at a thankless job .
what that man needs is a good , healthy boink fest .
unfortunately , there was a major babe drought in my school .
the evil trolls from the math department were actually married .
ooh , snickers .
and in the grand tradition of p. e. teachers ,
ms. stoeger seemed to be same sex oriented .
of course , there was always miss geist .
something told me not to discount miss geist .
well , sure , she has runs in her stockings , and her slip is always showing , and she has more lipstick on her teeth than on her mouth .
popular uprisings from estates to the general assembly !
god , this woman is screaming for a makeover .
i'm her only hope .
rough winds do shake the darling buds of may , but thy eternal summer shall not fade .
did you write that?
tscha !
it's a famous quote .
from where?
cliffs notes .
run along .
see you third period .
try to remember to bring our textbooks .
oh , my god !
she actually looked happy .
classic !
paradoasm banofshon ... 16 tardies to work off .
janet hong ... no tardies .
travis birkenstock ... 38 tardies .
by far the most tardies in the class .
congratulations .
this is so unexpected .
i didn't even have a speech prepared .
uh , but i would like to say this .
tardiness is not something you can do all on your own .
many , many people contributed to my tardiness .
thanks to my parents for never giving me a ride to school , the l. a. city bus driver for taking a chance on an unknown kid , the wonderful crew at mcdonald's for spending hours making those egg mcmuffins , without which i might never be tardy .
if mr. birkenstock has no political messages to include in his speech ,
i'll go on .
cher horowitz ... two tardies .
i object !
do you recall the dates of these alleged tardies?
one was last monday .
mr. hall , i was surfing the crimson wave .
i had to haul ass to the ladies .
i assume you are referring to women's troubles , so i'll let that one slide .
thank you , mr. hall .
miss geist was right about you .
what do you mean?
well , she said that you were the only one in this school with any intelligence .
cher , get in here .
yes , daddy?
will you tell me what the hell this is?
a second notice for three outstanding tickets .
i don't remember getting a first notice .
the ticket is the first notice .
i didn't know you could get tickets without a license !
sure you can .
you can get tickets anytime .
well , not around here you can't .
from this moment on , you will not drive , sit , do anything in that jeep without a supervised driver .
no cruising around with dionne .
two permits do not equal a license .
do i make myself clear?
yes , daddy .
cher , i expect you to become a good driver .
i will .
i'm going to practice real hard .
o. k.
a licensed driver with nothing to do?
where would i find such a loser?
granola breath , you got something on your chin .
i'm growing a goatee .
you don't want to be the last one at the coffeehouse without chin pubes .
i enjoy these little chats of ours , but in the interest of saving time , just tell me what you want .
o. k.
so , actually , i have a permit , but daddy says i can't take the jeep out without a licensed driver .
since you're not doing anything ...
what are the chances of you shutting up till you get your way?
slim to none .
come on .
hey , james bond .
in america , we drive on the right side of the road .
i am .
you try driving in platforms .
i got to get back to school .
want to practice parking?
what's the point?
everywhere you go has valet .
what class you going to?
actually , i'm going to a tree people meeting .
we might get marky mark to plant a celebrity tree .
how fabulous .
getting marky mark to take time from his busy pants dropping schedule to plant trees .
why don't you hire a gardener?
maybe marky mark wants to use his popularity for a good cause , make a contribution .
in case you've never heard of that , a contribution is ...
i have donated many italian outfits to lucy .
as soon as i get my license ,
i fully intend to brake for animals , and i have contributed many hours to helping two lonely teachers find romance .
which i'll bet serves your interests more than theirs .
if i ever saw you do anything that wasn't 90 % selfish ,
i'd die of shock .
oh , that would be reason enough for me .
would you call me selfish?
no .
not to your face .
really?
is josh giving you shit because he's in his postadolescent idealistic phase?
look , there's mr. hall .
mr. hall !
mr. hall !
um , do you drink coffee?
not from this cafeteria .
yes , under normal circumstances .
i am such a retard .
when i was packing daddy's lunch ,
i gave him my lemon snapple and took his sucky italian roast .
do you want it?
you sure you don't want it?
tscha !
it might stunt my growth .
i want to be 5'10 like cindy crawford .
but i thought you or miss geist might like it .
maybe you could share it .
well ... thanks .
sure .
miss geist !
miss geist !
did you sign up for the environmental fair?
we will .
you have pretty eyes .
don't hide them .
these clips are so cute .
and this tiny little waist .
look .
wow .
girls .
oh , don't forget to sign up for the environmental fair .
not a total betty , but a vast improvement .
we did our best .
we got to book to p. e.
come on , dee .
i feel like bailing , dude .
i know what you mean , but at least it's exercise .
i feel like such a heifer .
i had two bowls of special k , three pieces of turkey bacon , five peanut butter m& m's , and , like , three pieces of licorice .
oh , my god .
look .
is that a photo op or what?
look at that body language ...
legs crossed towards each other .
that's an unequivocal sex invite .
oh , cher , he's getting her digits .
look at geist .
she is so cute .
ohh .
old people can be so sweet .
?
the world is full of fools??
who never get it right??
you don't know what to do??
so you do anything you like??
put your feet in drive??
oh , you're a silly thing??
put your feet in drive??
you're such a pretty thing?
?
you're going out tonight?
?
there's nothing to lose ...??
the entire student body was utterly grateful for the improvement in their grades .?
don't ever change??
don't ever change??
no , never change??
cher , what's this all about?
my report card?
the same semester?
uh huh .
what did you do?
turn in extra credit?
no .
take the midterms over?
uh uh .
you mean to tell me that you argued your way from a c plus to an a minus?
totally based on my powers of persuasion .
you proud?
i couldn't be happier if they were based on real grades .
fabulous .
i felt so satisfied , i wanted to do more good deeds .
ah choo !
dee , when your allergies act up , take out your nose ring .
follow through !
there you go .
there you go .
all right , cher !
earth to cher .
come in , cher .
ms. stoeger ...
i would just like to say that physical education in this school is a disgrace .
i mean , standing in line for 40 minutes is hardly aerobically effective .
i doubt i worked off the calories in a stick of carefree gum .
whoo !
whoo !
you exercised your mouth , cher .
hit the ball .
ms. stoeger , that machine is just a lawsuit waiting to happen .
thanks for the legal advice .
dionne , you're up .
i have a note from my tennis instructor saying i shouldn't expose myself to any training that might derail his teachings .
fine .
amber !
my plastic surgeon doesn't want me doing any activity where balls fly at my nose .
well , there goes your social life .
ms. stoeger ... got another one .
ladies , we have a new student with us .
this is tai frasier .
you could hit a few balls in those clothes .
she could be a farmer in those clothes .
dee , my mission is clear .
would you look at that girl?
she is so adorably clueless .
we've got to adopt her .
she is toe up .
our stock would plummet .
don't you want to use your popularity for a good cause?
no .
come here !
yeah , come here .
hang with us .
oh , thank you .
how do you like california?
man , i'm freakin '.
i could really use some sort of herbal refreshment .
we do lunch in 10 minutes .
we don't have any tea , but we have coke .
you guys got coke here?
yeah .
this is america .
so we decided to show tai the ropes at bronson alcott high school .
that is alana's group over there .
they do the tv station .
they think that's the most important thing on earth .
and that's the persian mafia .
you can't hang with them unless you own a bmw .
there's elton in the white vest , with all the most popular boys .
including my boyfriend .
ain't he cute?
if you decide to date a high school boy , they're the only acceptable ones .
which one of them's your boyfriend?
as if !
cher's got attitude about high school boys .
it's a personal choice every woman has got to make for herself .
woman , lend me $5 . 00 .
murray , i have asked you repeatedly not to call me woman .
excuse me , miss dionne , street slang is an increasingly valid form of expression .
most feminine pronouns do have mocking but not necessarily misogynistic undertone .
wow .
you guys talk like grownups .
well , this is a really good school .
i'm going to go get a soda .
do you guys want?
sure .
she's nice .
ooh !
project !
oh , wow .
that's disgusting .
that's a nice representation .
thanks .
those are really nice stickers .
i was thinking it was too cluttered .
i want to concentrate on one main decorative statement ,
like marvin the martian right there .
i can do marvin the martian .
really?
i mean there's not really a lot to him , but you want to see?
yeah .
that's really cool .
thanks .
wait .
i got one here .
you didn't trace these?
uh uh .
no .
here's another one over here ... and lots of little guys .
that is so cute .
you're really good at it .
no .
no , really .
you are .
yeah .
are you sure that's fat free?
oh , yes .
and you lose weight by cutting it small .
i met a really cool guy .
describe .
he's got long hair .
straight off he offers me some smoke .
there he is !
are you talking about drugs?
yeah .
tai , how old are you?
i'll be 16 in may .
my birthday's in april , and as someone older , can i please give you some advice?
it is one thing to spark up a doobie at parties , but it is another to be fried all day .
do you see the distinction?
yeah .
loadies generally hang on the grassy knoll .
sometimes they come to class and say bonehead things , and we all laugh , of course , but no respectable girl actually dates them .
you don't want to start off on the wrong foot , do you?
i've got an idea .
let's do a makeover .
no .
no .
cher's main thrill in life is a makeover .
it gives her a sense of control in a chaotic world .
please?
sure .
why not?
you guys , i've never had straight friends before .
?
i don't care??
what my teachers say??
i'm gonna be a supermodel??
and everyone??
is gonna dress like me??
wait and see??
when i'm a supermodel??
and my hair will shine like the sea?
?
and everyone??
will want to look??
just like me??
eeee??
'cause i'm young??
i'm hip??
and so beautiful??
i'm going to be a supermodel??
squeeze your buttocks when you come up .
squeeze in .
i don't want to do this anymore .
my buns don't feel nothing like steel .
o. k. it will get easier .
i promise .
just as long as we do it every day , not sporadically .
how do you know if we're doing it sporadically?
we've got to work on your accent and vocabulary .
sporadic means once in a while .
use it in a sentence today .
from now on , we're alternating cindy crawford's aerobicize and buns of steel and reading one nonschool book a week .
my first book is fit or fat .
mine is men are from mars , women are from venus .
good .
that takes care of our minds and bodies , but we should do something good for mankind for a couple of hours .
hey , brainiac .
ugh .
the dreaded ex .
tai , this is josh .
nice to meet you .
hey !
you know about this stuff .
i want to do something good for humanity .
how about sterilization?
ha ha ha !
so what do you think?
i'm amazed .
that i am devoting myself so generously to someone else?
that you found someone more clueless than you are to worship you .
i am rescuing her from teenage hell .
the wounds of adolescence can take years to heal .
you've never had a mother .
you're acting out on that poor girl
like your barbie doll .
freshman psych .
i am not taking psych .
i am going to take that lost soul and make her well dressed and popular .
her life will be better because of me .
how many girls can say that about you??
mentos better??
mentos fresher??
fresh goes better??
with mentos , fresh and full of life !??
mentos .
the freshmaker .
be seeing ya .
yeah , i hope not sporadically .
do you see how boys are responding?
my heart is totally bursting .
i know !
cher , you have deamer?
geist .
hey , tai , did you get a flyer?
uh uh .
wow !
a party !
it's in the valley .
the cops usually break them up in less than an hour , and it takes that long to get there .
it's just local loadies .
do you guys think travis will be there?
i thought we moved on from there .
don't sell yourself short .
you've got something no one here has .
i'm not a virgin .
as far as everyone's concerned , you're the most popular girl in your school .
the fact that you hang with dee and i , well ...
speaks very highly of you .
if you strike while the iron is hot , you can have any guy that you want .
like who?
who's available?
there's bronson ...
i got it !
elton !
he just broke up with folette !
who's elton?
he's way popular ,
like the social director of the crew .
his dad can get you into any concert .
i noticed him scoping you out .
he was looking at me?
says you gave him a toothache .
how'd i do that?
he thought you were sweet .
yeah?
yeah?
wow !
is that true?
no .
you are so bad !
o. k. , you guys , all get together .
that is great .
smile !
tai , get a little closer .
closer , tai .
oh , great .
hey , elton , um ... why don't you put your arm around tai?
all right .
yeah , that's good .
o. k.
o. k. tai .
come here , tai .
hold that .
o. k.
o. k.
cool picture .
doesn't she look classic?
yeah , she's beautiful .
she's like one of those botticelli chicks .
why don't you make me a copy of this , o. k.?
sure .
hi , daddy .
this is my friend tai .
get out of my chair !
thank you , lucy .
it looks great .
what is this crap?
it's from the cut your cholesterol cookbook .
dr. lovett says that you've got to get down to 200 .
no calls tonight .
but it's dionne .
it might be important .
we're having a nice family dinner .
so , uh , what did you do in school today?
well ...
i broke in my purple clogs .
yeah , hello?
dee?
what up?
so check it .
murray's geometry class is right by elton's locker .
taped up inside was the picture of tai .
oh , my god .
elton's got a picture of you in his locker .
oh , no shit !
hello?
the whole crew is going to this party in the valley .
bye .
we're going to have to make a cameo at the val party .
i said i wanted it in the morning !
no !
just look at the top of the map .
sun valley is north .
no .
all i see is bel air .
you're on the wrong map .
look at the number on the top .
there are no numbers .
there's letters .
uh !
murray , shut up .
listen , tai , when we get there , make sure elton sees you , but don't say hi first .
look like you're having fun and you're popular .
talk to a guy in his eyeline .
make him come to you .
find an excuse to leave during the conversation .
always have him wanting more .
i got it .
heads up !
oh !
did you just see that?
skateboards .
that is , like , so five years ago .
you guys came .
that's great .
you want a beer?
i'll get you a beer .
no .
yeah !
oh , yeah !
this shit is whack .
this is ragin '.
let's do a lap before we commit to a location .
aah !
hey !
who was that?
cher , ain't that the same dress that you was wearing yesterday?
say , ambular .
hi !
was that you going through my laundry?
as if !
like i would really wear something from judy's .
do you prefer fashion victim or ensembly challenged?
uh !
that clone .
you look much better in that dress .
hey !
ruin my satin shoes , why don't you?
i'm sorry .
excuse me .
my shoes .
uh !
this is so not fixable .
it's a small price to pay to the party gods .
look , i'll make amends .
how about some chronic shit?
it's the least you can do .
let's spark it .
hey , elton's over there .
act like travis is saying something funny .
sorry .
ha ha ha !
what's so funny?
nothing .
oh , here .
hey , everyone .
let's play suck and blow .
god , elton !
can't you suck?
aah !
no !
it's dee !
come on !
what have you done?
oh , my god !
why did you do this to your head?
'cause i'm keeping it real .
look what he's done !
can you believe this?
look at lawrence's head .
it's the bomb !
you look good !
as will you .
what do you care what he thinks?
i have to look at you .
what am i going to do with you now?
right before the yearbook pictures?
what will i tell my grandchildren?
you know what?
o. k. that's it .
i'm calling your mother .
hold up !
no , no , no !
wait !
don't call my mom !
yo , man !
chill !
chill !
don't call my mom !
the same thing happened at the spring dance .
she spent the entire afterparty in the bathroom .
that almost destroyed my buzz .
i'm still baked .
what do you say we go bump into people?
yeah .
i'm cool with that .
hey , tai !
wait up !
are you o. k.?
yeah .
where's your sense of good hospitality?
that was so cool the way you did that .
i wish i could do it .
oh , no .
don't .
why not?
if girls did it , how would guys impress them?
i don't know , like ... stuff .
what kind of stuff?
tai , i need you .
elton's over there .
?
rollin 'with my homies?
?
rollin 'with my homies??
tai !
tai !
elton , help me !
use this .
you guys should use ice .
travis , we've got it under control !
tai , are you o. k.?
travis , tai would have wanted you to enjoy the party .
if it's a concussion , keep her conscious .
ask her questions .
what's 7 times 7?
stuff she knows .
that's some bump you got there .
yeah .
you ready to go back out there?
yeah , i am .
you sure?
can you do this??
rollin 'with the homies??
rollin 'with the homies??
good !
let's do it .
you're ready .
i had to give myself snaps for all the good deeds i was doing .
it was great .
love was everywhere , and even though i was alone ,
i was really happy for tai .
it's like that book i read in ninth grade that said , 'tis a far , far better thing doing stuff for other people .
hello?
do you know what time it is?
a watch doesn't really go with this outfit , daddy .
where are you?
having a snack with my girlfriends .
where , in kuwait?
is that in the valley?
i expect you to walk in this door in 20 minutes .
well , um , it might take longer than that , dad .
everywhere in l. a. takes 20 minutes .
sorry to make you leave .
dionne's bucking for best dramatic actress at a val party .
ha ha ha !
hey , summer .
hi .
pretty random fiesta .
want a ride home?
that would be great .
thanks .
no , i got her .
i'm right below wilshire and linden .
that's right near me .
i'm above olympic .
great .
tai will go with summer .
cher , you'll come with me .
actually , if you take wilshire to canon , that turns into benedict .
then she'd have to go back south , and i'm already going north .
but you could take tai on your way up to sunset .
that doesn't make any sense .
i'd have to get off the freeway .
i hate that .
tai , go with summer .
cher , you'll come with me .
watch your feet .
didn't tai look cute tonight??
away??
turn away??
turn away??
turn away??
i really love her hair when it's all wild , you know?
it's also very pretty when it's all up with that curly tendrils ,
like in that picture i took .
you know , you're one of my best friends , and i do not have friends that are girls .
well , i'm glad , because your happiness means a lot to me .
it does?
sure .
i saw how hard your breakup with folette was .
yeah .
i think we both know what it feels like to be lonely .
whatever .
the thing is , i'd really like to see you settled .
where are we going?
i knew it .
i knew it .
you knew what?
that you were totally sprung on me .
hello?
don't you mean tai?
tai?
her picture's in your locker .
the picture you took is in my locker .
oh , i'm having a twin peaks experience .
i knew it when you kissed me .
suck and blow is a game , elton .
i know it's a game .
stop it !
fine .
you know , i don't get you , cher .
you flirt with me all year ...
as if !
i have been trying to get you with tai !
tai?
why would i go with tai?
why not?
why not?
don't you even know who my father is?
you are a snob and a half .
cher , listen to me .
me and tai ... we don't make any sense .
all right?
me and ... and you ... well , i mean ... it makes sense .
cut it out !
come on !
stop it !
cher !
where you going?
you're only hurting yourself here , baby .
you going to walk home?
get back in the car , please .
get back in the car .
leave me alone !
fine !
hey !
where are you going?
oh , shit !
valley information .
do you have a number of a cab company?
which one?
i don't know .
what do you have?
hand it over .
give me the phone .
o. k. the bag , too .
come on !
all right .
now , uh ... get down on the ground face down .
come on !
oh , no .
you don't understand .
this is an alaia .
an a what a?
it's , like , a totally important designer .
i will totally shoot you in the head .
get down !
that's good .
yeah .
all right .
um ...
count to 100 .
thank you .
1 ... 2 ... 3 ...
the evening had turned into a royal mess ... sexually harassed , robbed .
i didn't know the number of the party , so i couldn't call dionne , and daddy would kill me if he knew where i was .
there was just one person left to call , and i really , really didn't want to call him .
come on .
hello?
josh , you busy?
it's mel's daughter .
i was at this party , and my designated driver tried to attack me .
i got out , but then he drove off and deserted me .
then this guy with a gun held me up , took my money and my phone , yelled at me , and forced me to ruin my dress .
o. k. o. k.
um , where are you?
sun valley .
man , you owe me .
the man is ridiculous .
he doesn't have one unique thought in his little , puny brain .
i think that there's some merit in learning form straight off .
oh , josh , please !
he's taken our minds at the most fecund point and restrained them before they've wandered through the garden of ideas .
it's just like hamlet said ,
to thine own self be true .
no .
hamlet didn't say that .
i think that i remember hamlet accurately .
well , i remember mel gibson accurately , and he didn't say that .
that polonius guy did .
ha ha ha !
i'm going to walk heather to her door .
try and stay out of trouble .
ew !
my life is turning into a bigger disaster than malibu .
i didn't know what i was going to say to tai .
i felt really nervous .
even fabian , my masseuse , said i had a lot of tension in my back .
it's my hips , isn't it?
no , of course not .
don't be stupid .
you could do so much better .
he thinks he's all that , tai .
yeah .
god's gift .
you're too good for him .
if i'm too good for him , then how come i'm not with him?
i have got an idea .
let's blow off seventh and eighth , go to the mall , have a calorie fest , and see the new christian slater .
yes !
oh , you guys !
look at him .
ooh , baby .
break me off a piece of that .
ha ha ha !
survey says?
doable .
puny .
i like them big .
oh , i hate muscles .
i don't really care either way .
just as long as his you know what isn't crooked .
i really hate that .
what?
shh !
don't scare her .
why?
what's wrong?
cher is saving herself for luke perry .
cher , you're a virgin?
god !
you say it like it's a bad thing .
besides , the pc term is hymenally challenged .
i am not interested in doing it until i find the right person .
you see how picky i am about my shoes .
they only go on my feet .
you're one to talk , dee .
oh , wait a minute !
i thought that you and murray were ...
my man is satisfied .
he's got no cause for complaints .
but technically , i am a virgin .
you know what i mean .
oh , god .
what's wrong , tai?
they're playing our song ...
the one that elton and i danced to .
oh .
?
rollin 'with the homies??
oh , tai .
don't cry .
i'm sorry .
oh , my gosh .
stop !
i could tell tai's grieving period would be considerable , unless i found someone to take elton's place right away .
i don't want to be a traitor to my generation , but i don't get how guys dress today .
it looks like they just fell out of bed and put on some baggy pants and take their greasy hair ...
ugh !
and cover it up with a backwards cap , and , like , we're expected to swoon?
i don't think so .
searching for a boy in high school is as useless as searching for meaning in a pauly shore movie .
so this must be the elusive christian .
where should i park?
there's one .
third back .
o. k. o. k.
now , i know i said i would find a guy for tai , but i suppose there's no harm in finding one for myself also .
nice stems .
thanks .
cher?
present .
we established that during attendance .
it's time for your oral .
excuse me?
your original oral .
violence in the media .
oh !
so , o. k.
the attorney general says there's too much violence on tv , and that should stop .
even if you took out all the violent shows , you could still see the news .
so until mankind is peaceful enough not to have violence on the news , there's no point in taking it out of shows that need it for entertainment value .
thank you .
any comments?
elton?
my foot hurts .
can i go to the nurse?
travis?
two very enthusiastic thumbs up .
fine holiday fun .
hello?
was i the only one listening?
i mean , i thought it reeked .
i believe that was your designer impostor perfume .
i dug it .
during the next few days ,
i did what any normal girl would do .
i sent myself love letters and flowers and candy , just so he'd see how desired i was in case he didn't already know .?
he got the finest face i ever seen??
and the body to go with it??
i'm telling you , he's mean??
and my girlfriends be telling me??
they be seeing him and he be asking about me??
and anything you can do to draw attention to your mouth is good .
also , sometimes you have to show a little skin .
this reminds guys of being naked , and then they think of sex .
hey , duchess?
yes?
you rashin 'this weekend?
huh?
like saturday .
i'm new , but i thought maybe you had an in on the heavy clambakes .
well , my ex stepbrother's friends are having a party .
solid .
daddy had an urgent case .
some clerks and josh helped him go through a gazillion depositions .
daddy !
what?
i can't open it .
i have to make him wait !
then he can wait outside .
josh , please !
come on , josh !
come on !
what do you hear?
she's not ready .
hey , man .
nice pile of bricks you got here .
you drink?
no , thanks .
i'm cool .
i'm not offering .
i'm asking you if you drink .
you think i'd give alcohol to teenage drivers taking my daughter out?
the protective vibe .
i dig .
you think the death of sammy davis
left an opening in the rat pack?
christian .
doll face .
handsome .
stunning .
you're not letting her go out like that , are you?
cher , get in here .
what's up?
what the hell is that?
a dress .
says who?
calvin klein .
it looks like underwear .
go upstairs and put something over it .
tscha !
i was just going to .
hey , you .
anything happens to my daughter ,
i got a . 45 and a shovel .
i doubt anybody would miss you .
bye , daddy .
come on .
oh , it's so killer !
thank you .
your dad is pretty scary .
isn't he?
you like billie holiday?
i love him .
right .
?
who do you think is coming to town???
you'll never guess who??
lovable , hugable ...??
i didn't like him .
what's to like?
maybe i should go to the party .
if you feel like you should go ...
you don't need me , do you?
no , no .
josh , go to the party .
go , go , go .
o. k.
uh ...
i'll watch her for you .
o. k.
you do that .
?
there was a place??
and the name of the place escapes me??
when i can't remember , it irritates me??
could be i can't remember??
could be i choose to not??
let's move along the song and try to find the plot??
there was a girl??
and i don't know her name , either??
she gave me love , and i said i'd never leave her??
and if i did , i'd come back someday and find her??
maybe i will , i should write up a reminder??
one day??
one day , who knows???
someday?
?
someday i suppose ...??
tai !
whoa !
oh , my god !
tai , are you o. k.?
shit !
that is so embarrassing !
no one saw it .
now all night long , i'll be known as that girl who fell on her butt .
wow !
are you o. k.?
that looked really bad .
yeah .
thanks .
oh , my god , cher .
look .
he's going with amber?
no .
he's probably just dancing with her .
do you think she's pretty?
no .
she's a monet .
what's a monet?
it's like the paintings , see?
from far away , it's o. k.
up close , it's a big old mess .
christian , what do you think of amber?
hagsville .
see?
they're charging for brewskies .
pass me a fin , i'll pay you back?
sure .
thanks .
oh , he's so cute .
oh , my god .
do you see how he's falling in love with me?
i mean , look how he ignores every other girl .
oh , god , look .
there's josh .
he finds the only adult in here ,
like he's deliberately trying to not have fun .
cher , i have a question .
what should i do with this thing?
should i tie it around or put it over ...
tie it around your waist .
ready to slide?
let's go .
?
where did you go???
where did you go???
where did you go???
where did you go???
where did you go???
you played a tape i couldn't hear??
emptiness began to roam , and where did you go??
the band was kickin ', and christian was the hottest guy there .
but my enjoyment was put on pause when i saw how unhappy tai was .? ... wish you sent me this would end??
wrote a note , then tore it up??
poured the beer into a cup , sat on the couch??
drank and smoked , wondering where did you go ...??
hi .
hi .
i think we were born to move .
look !
josh is dancing with tai !
he never dances !
i can see why .
no .
he's doing her a prop so she won't be left out .
oh , i dig you .
?
get on the floor , and let's dance some more??
get on the floor , and let's dance some more??
get on the floor , and let's dance some more??
get on the floor , and let's dance some more??
how are you guys holding up?
i am so ready to leave .
i'm tired .
let's get christian and go .
christian !
you want to go?
now?
these guys got the skinny on the happening after hours .
my trainer's coming really early .
i can take the girls home .
no .
that's all right .
thanks .
no .
it's fine .
stay .
you sure?
yeah , sure .
thanks , man .
you got my mark .
you are a down girl .
i'll call you tomorrow .
it was really decent of you to dance with tai .
my pleasure .
you notice any positive changes in her?
yeah .
under your tutelage , she's exploring the challenging world of bare midriffs .
so you didn't want to make a night of it with the ring a ding kid?
daddy won't go too ballistic .
it's not like he'll sleep .
not if they're going to finish those depos .
it would be dope if we got some really delicious take out .
i bet they haven't eaten all night .
that would be pretty ... dope of us .
let's do it .
the midnight snack totally revived the lawyers , and daddy was way grateful .
eat oranges .
get vitamin c.
daddy , no !
cher , come on .
you can't have that .
i know it sounds mental , but sometimes i have more fun vegging out than when i go partying .
maybe because my party clothes are so binding .
how many hours a day do you spend grooming yourself?
some people aren't lucky enough to be as naturally adorable as you are .
stop it .
you're making me blush .
hello .
hi , cher .
how are you?
hi , gail .
is my son there , cleaning out your refrigerator?
no , no , he's not here .
you should try the dorms .
all right .
bye , hon .
bye bye .
what was that all about?
she wants me to come home for spring break .
so?
nobody will be in school .
husband number four's at home , and his idea of acting like a family is to criticize me .
you're going to roam around campus by yourself?
i don't mind .
that is stupid .
come here .
have your old room .
there will be some great parties .
no .
why not?
you got your whole social world going on .
i'd get in the way .
you won't be in the way .
how much fun would it be having a brother type tagging along?
josh , you're not my brother .
you know what i mean .
come on .
you need some excitement in your life .
it will replenish you for your finals .
o. k.
good .
i can't believe i'm taking advice from someone who watches cartoons .
be quiet , you idiot !
that's ren & stimpy .
they're way existential .
do you have any idea what you're talking about?
no .
why , do i sound like i do?
ha ha !
a space odyssey playing ]
christian said he'd call the next day .
in boy time , that meant thursday .
you can imagine my astonishment to hear from him while i was packing daddy up .
he said he'd come over with some videotapes .
a night alone with christian?
i sent for reinforcements .
then dee and i had to design a lighting concept .
and costume decisions .
i don't rely on mirrors , so i always take polaroids .?
and you're the one i've always planned to be ...?
whenever a boy comes , you should always have something baking .?
i believe i'm you??
yes , i do??
i believe i'm you??
you know it's true??
oh ...
i'm still all red !
i'm trying to make you as white as i can , cher .
look , you're all flushed .
you have to calm down , o. k.?
calm .
you know , i am so glad i never did it with someone i had lukewarm feelings for because christian is brutally hot , and i am going to remember tonight forever .
blot .
hi .
hi .
is something burning?
oh , my god !
oops .
aw , honey , you baked .
i tried .
come on .
show me the rest of your pad .
your father has a well rounded collection .
daddy says it's a good investment .
he's absolutely right .
claes oldenburg .
he's way famous .
ooh .
but this is older , see?
transitional .
a very important piece .
um , you want to go swimming?
mmm .
let's watch the movies .
oh , o. k.
christian had a thing for tony curtis , so he brought over some like it hot and sparatacus .
singer of songs .
for whom did you practice this wondrous talent?
for the children of my master , whom i also taught the classics .
classics , indeed?
what position have we , i wonder , for a boy of such varied gifts?
you shall be my body servant .
all of you , come with me .
my feet are cold .
huh .
thanks .
oh , watch this part .
this is good .
are you o. k.?
uh , i'm fine .
um , do you want some ... something to drink?
i could get you some wine .
no .
you notice how wine makes people want to feel , like , sexy?
well , that's o. k.
i'm actually getting tired .
but i can make you some coffee if you'd like .
oh , no , thanks .
got the ulcer .
but you had all those cappuccinos before .
oh .
well , you know , that was , like , uh , foam .
you're great .
we're friends , right?
yeah .
knock me a little kiss .
see you .
i don't get it .
did my hair get flat?
did i stumble into some bad lighting?
what's wrong with me?
nothing .
maybe he really was tired .
i suppose it wasn't meant to be .
he does dress better than i do .
what would i bring to the relationship?
get back into the right lane ...
what's the first thing you do?
first thing i do is put on my blinker .
oh , wait .
shit .
watch the road !
stop .
then i look in my mirror .
o. k.
then i glance at my blind spot .
with your head , not the whole car !
i swear to god .
i swear to god , woman !
you can't drive for shit !
i'm not trying to hear that .
hear me !
you ...
actually , going all the way is , like , a really big decision .
i can't believe i was so capricious about it .
dee , i almost had sex with him .
you almost had sex with who?
christian .
what?
yo , look !
are you bitches blind or something?
your man christian is a cake boy .
a what?
a what?
he's a disco dancing , oscar wilde reading ,
streisand ticket holding friend of dorothy .
uh uh .
no way .
he's gay .
not even .
yes , even .
he does like to shop , cher , and the boy can dress .
oh , my god .
i'm totally buggin '.
i feel like such a bonehead .
what the hell?
yo !
you're getting on the freeway !
turn right !
get out of the lane !
no , no !
forget procedure !
get out of the lane !
truck !
truck !
truck !
we're on the freeway !
what do i do , murray?
go straight !
go straight !
go straight !
oh , shit !
just relax and drive , baby .
just relax and drive .
o. k.
i'm here with you .
i'm here with you .
shut up !
aah !
aah !
aah !
whatever you do , keep your hands on the wheel at all times !
aah !
look , just go !
aah !
go to the right !
oh , there it is .
all right , we're off .
woo !
damn .
you did wonderful .
it's all right , baby .
relax , relax , relax .
honey , relax .
baby , relax .
breathe , breathe .
breathe in .
breathe .
let it out .
breathe , breathe , breathe .
relax , relax .
boy , getting off the freeway makes you realize how important love is .
after that , dionne's virginity went from technical to nonexistent .
i realized how much i wanted a boyfriend of my own .
not that christian wasn't a blast to hang out with .
he was becoming one of my favorite shopping partners .
so was the red .
um , where's tai?
she met some random guys at the foot locker and escorted them right over there .
oh , my god !
did you ...
i don't know where she meets these barneys .
i have a question , all right?
what?
the jacket ...
is it james dean or jason priestley?
carpe diem , o. k.?
you looked hot in it .
really?
if i fall , would you guys catch me?
could they please be more generic?
aah !
stop it !
please !
bring me back up !
aah !
aah !
let me down !
thank you .
you asshole !
hey , man , we're just joking .
oh , really?
somebody could get killed .
oh , my god .
cher , you don't understand .
i was sitting there .
i was just talking to those guys .
all of a sudden , we were laughing and ...
hey , you o. k.?
y yeah .
you sure?
i'm fine .
uh huh .
let's get you home for some r and r.
what's that?
boy , considering how clueless she was ,
tai certainly had that damsel in distress act down .
meanwhile , back at school , everyone was talking about
tai's brush with death at the mall .
was it a montage of all the scenes in your life?
not exactly a montage .
hey , cher , is it true gang members tried to shoot tai?
no .
that's what everyone's saying .
whatever .
when i was 9 , i fell off this jungle gym .
i swear i saw this ...
will you move down for cher?
tell me more .
tell me more .
where was i?
you were thinking about what was really important .
oh , right , right .
right before you die , your mind just sort of gets very clear .
it's a very intense spiritual thing .
i know when i was held at gunpoint ...
excuse me .
you were saying?
it's spiritual .
i can't pinpoint the spirituality .
if you've never experienced anything ...
tai , i was planning on going to tower and getting something for christian .
uh huh .
like some kind of present or something .
you want to come?
sure .
i owe him my life .
i'll get you after school .
yeah .
not today .
i'm going over to melrose with amber .
we're going to melrose .
oh .
well , how about tomorrow?
do you think we could do it next monday?
my week's filling up fast here .
when we got back from the ihop , it was 8 : 00 .
here comes your boyfriend .
tai , check it out .
ew !
ew !
hey , could you shove down a little bit?
no .
don't the slackers prefer that grassy knoll over there?
tai , so anyway , have you ever done it in water?
oh , yeah .
really?
what was happening?
dionne asking tai for sex advice?
tai being the most popular girl in the school?
it was like some sort of alternate universe .
on top of everything else ,
i was going to take the driving test , so i had to find my most responsible looking ensemble .
where's my white collarless shirt?
lucy , where's my shirt?
probably at the cleaner .
oh , but today's the driving test .
it's my most capable looking outfit .
o. k. , i call them .
oh , it's too late now .
oh , we got another notice from the fire department , saying we have to clear out the bush .
you said jose would do it .
he your gardener .
you tell him .
lucy , i don't speak mexican .
i not a mexican !
great .
what was that all about?
lucy's from el salvador .
so?
it's an entirely different country .
what does that matter?
you get upset if someone thinks you live below sunset .
so everything is all my fault .
i'm always wrong , right?
you're such a brat .
i had an overwhelming sense of ickyness .
even though i apologized to lucy , something was still plaguing me .
like josh thinking i was mean was making me postal .
move into the right lane .
anyway , why should i care what josh thinks?
why was i letting it throw me into such turmoil?
watch out for the bike rid ...
oops !
my bad .
what are you doing?
you can't take up both lanes .
get in the right lane .
not so ...
ooh !
should i write them a note?
pull over up here and turn off the engine .
right there .
oh !
are you going to take me somewhere to make left hand turns?
we're going back .
it's over?
it's over .
well , how did i do?
how did you do?
well , let's see , shall we?
you can't park , you can't switch lanes , you can't make right hand turns , you've damaged private property , and you almost killed someone .
offhand , i'd say you failed .
failed?
well , can't we just start over?
i mean , i'm kind of having a personal problem .
my mind was somewhere else .
that biker came out of nowhere !
oh !
i swear i'll concentrate !
i drive really good , usually .
isn't there somebody else i can talk to?
you can't be the absolute and final word in driver's licenses .
girlie , as far as you're concerned ,
i'm the messiah of the dmv .
now , get out of the car .
i can't believe i failed .
i failed something i couldn't talk my way out of?
go ahead , yeah .
put your legs into me .
hey , you're home .
how does it feel to have a license?
i wouldn't know .
i failed .
oh .
bummer .
and , josh , spare me your lectures on how driving is such a big responsibility and you can't b. s. your way through it .
i didn't say anything .
i know what you're thinking .
i got to tell you something .
i'm really sorry about your test .
i am so glad you're here .
there's something i got to do .
i need you here .
does this work?
yeah .
what is this stuff?
a bunch of junk that reminded me of elton .
i want to burn it because i'm so over him .
what stuff?
do you remember when we were at the val party and the clog knocking me out and elton got a towel of ice?
i didn't tell you at the time , but i took the towel as a souvenir .
you're kidding .
no .
and then ... remember that song that was playing when we danced?
remember that?
you know , rollin 'with the homies .
anyways , i got the tape , right?
i listened to it , like , every single night .
don't burn that , o. k.?
tai , i'm really happy for you , but what brought on this surge of empowerment?
it's , like , i met this guy who's so totally amazing that he makes elton look like a loser .
that is so great .
look , you've got to help me get josh .
get josh what?
you know what i mean?
i like him .
do you think that he likes you?
yeah .
how do you know?
like , little things , you know?
like , he always finds some sort of way to touch me or tickle me .
do you remember the time at the frat when i was totally depressed?
we danced , and he was really flirty .
you o. k.?
yeah .
oh , actually ...
i was really bad today .
i had two mochaccinos .
i feel like ralphing .
i know exactly how that feels .
like , the other day , i was talking to josh , and we were discussing the difference between high school girls and college girls .
college girls wear less makeup .
that's why guys like them more .
but , tai , do you really think you'd be good with josh?
i mean , he's , like , a school nerd .
am i some sort of a mentally challenged airhead?
no !
not even !
i didn't say that .
i'm not good enough for josh or something?
i ...
i just ... don't think you mesh well together .
you don't think that we mesh well?
why am i even listening to you to begin with?
you're a virgin who can't drive .
oh , that was way harsh , tai .
all right .
look , i'm really sorry .
let's just talk when we've mellowed , all right?
i'm audi .
what did i do?
i've created some sort of a monster .
i could feel the chunks start to rise up in my throat .
i had to get out .
?
when i was young??
i never needed anyone?
everything i think and everything i do is wrong .
i was wrong about elton .
i was wrong about christian .
now josh hated me .
it all boiled down to one inevitable conclusion ...
i was just totally clueless .
oh , and this josh and tai thing was wiggin 'me more than anything .
what was my problem?
tai is my pal .
i don't begrudge her a boyfriend .
i really ...
ooh !
i wonder if they have that in my size .
what does she want with josh anyway?
he dresses funny .
he listens to complaint rock .
he's not even cute ... in a conventional way .
i mean , he's just like this slug who hangs around the house all the time .
and he's a hideous dancer .
couldn't take him anywhere .
wait a second .
what am i stressing about?
this is , like , josh .?
all by myself??
o. k. , o. k. , so he's kind of a baldwin .
what would he want with tai?
she couldn't make him happy .
josh needs someone with imagination , someone to take care of him , someone to laugh at his jokes ... in case he ever makes any .
then suddenly ...
oh , my god .
i love josh .
i am majorly , totally , crazy in love with josh .
but now i don't know how to act around him .
i mean , ordinarily , i'd strut around him in my cutest little outfits and send myself flowers and candy , but i couldn't do that stuff with josh .
what's with you?
what do you mean?
you're so quiet .
you haven't made me watch the real world .
i care about the news .
since when?
since now . ... ln central bosnia .
you look confused .
well , uh , i thought they declared peace in the middle east .
cher , get in here !
what's up , daddy?
what are you doing dancing in front of my office?
nothing .
i just wanted to see if you need any help with anything .
yeah , you can help me with something .
come over here .
all right .
every time that you see a telephone conversation that took place on september 3rd , highlight it .
just september 3rd .
o. k.
it's fun , huh?
yeah .
o. k.
daddy , did you ever have a problem that you couldn't argue your way out of?
tell me the problem , and we'll figure out how to argue it .
i like this boy , and he likes someone else .
how could that be?
i don't know .
i feel wretched .
obviously , this boy is a complete moron .
you are the most beautiful girl in beverly hills .
and to tell you the truth ,
i'm not sure i want you with a stupid fellow .
well , actually , he is a smart guy .
he's one of those do gooder types .
i feel like my after school commitments aren't good enough .
how can you say that?
who takes care of everyone in this household?
who makes sure that daddy eats right?
i have not seen such good doing since your mother .
really?
really .
now , get back to work .
later , while we were learning about the pismo beach disaster ,
i decided i needed a complete makeover , except this time , i'd makeover my soul .
but what makes somebody a better person?
then i realized all my friends were good in different ways .
like christian , he always wants things to be beautiful and interesting .
or dionne and murray , when they think no one is watching , are so considerate of each other .
and poor miss geist , always trying to get us involved no matter how much we resist .
oh .
that's just ...
that doesn't even show ...
every single possession , every memory , everything you've had your whole life gone in a second .
can you imagine what that must feel like?
elton?
can i use the pass?
yeah .
we'll be collecting blankets , disposable diapers , uh , canned goods .
miss geist?
cher?
i want to help .
that would be wonderful .
i felt better already .
daddy !
what?
you didn't like that red caviar , did you?
what's she talking about?
ew !
cher , what are you doing?
i'm captain of the pismo beach disaster relief .
i don't think they need your skis .
daddy , some people lost all their belongings .
don't you think that includes athletic equipment?
this is your influence , josh?
?
shake , some action's what i need??
to make a bus stop at full speed??
and i'm sure that's all you'll need??
to make it all right?? ... really fun .
it's so pretty .
should i leave it here?
could you bring it to bedding?
thank you very much .
oh , miss geist , i need more boxes .
they're all filled up .
already?
great .
i divided them into entrees and appetizers .
oh .
o. k. i'll have them picked up .
uh !
hey .
proper .
this is really decent of you , travis .
sure .
i wasn't sure about that .
i don't need it anymore , but far be it for me to deny anyone else .
i'm sorry about your shoes .
what shoes?
the red ones with the strappy thing .
oh , those are so last season .
what made you think of them?
it's one of my steps .
i joined this club , and there are these steps .
there's , like ... 12?
yeah .
how did you know?
wild guess .
wow .
good guess .
uh , also , here .
asl .
amateur skateboarding league .
this clarity thing , it's brought me to a whole new level .
my skating ...
would you come saturday?
sure .
ah , cool .
ha ha !
well , um , i guess kitchenware?
that's where i used to keep it .
hi .
hi .
cher , can i talk to you a minute?
um , sure .
look , i have been in agony for the past week .
i can't believe i went off the way i did .
no .
i have been going down a shame spiral .
i can't believe i was so unsupportive of your feelings for josh .
you're entitled to your opinion .
i'm the tard here .
cher , you've been nothing but super duper nice to me .
if it wasn't for me , you wouldn't have liked elton .
i'm so sorry , tai .
i'm really sorry .
oh , shit .
now i'm going to go ahead and cry .
let's never fight again , o. k.?
next up , number 14 , travis birkenstock .
woo !
all right , travis !
i had no idea he was so motivated .
oh , i did .
when i saw the sparks between tai and travis ,
i knew josh was out of the picture .
you look like pippi longstocking .
you look like forrest gump .
who's pippi longstocking?
uh , someone mel gibson never played .
you're funny .
what happened to the august 28th files?
hmm?
what?
mel wanted them tonight .
there were twice as many .
he's going to go ballistic .
where are they?
i think i checked them for the september 3rd conversations .
what?
where'd you put them?
i divided them into two piles .
i have to redo all that .
are you some kind of idiot?
hey , she didn't know .
she just set us back a day .
who cares about the september call?
i'm sorry .
just forget it .
just go back to the mall or something .
what's your problem , man?
she didn't mean any harm .
i'll get killed 'cause she's a moron .
she's not a moron .
if you were paying attention , it wouldn't have happened .
if you hadn't have been playing footsie , she wouldn't be bothering me .
what the hell are you talking about?
this is a multimillion dollar lawsuit , not some excuse for puppy love .
we've worked our butts off on this case !
do whatever you want with your butts .
i'm calling in sick .
did i really ruin daddy's lawsuit?
no .
of course not .
well , did i set him back?
i mean , there's so much work to be done , and he can't afford to lose that time .
don't worry .
i'll take care of it .
your father won't lose any time .
can you imagine the nerve of that guy?
i mean , making you worry like that .
he's the one that screwed up .
then he goes and blames us .
imagine saying we were ... you know .
that's right .
you've been very dedicated to this case .
yeah .
well , it was a good learning experience .
at least for me .
i want to be a lawyer .
but you , i mean , you don't need to be doing this .
go out and have fun .
go shopping .
you think that's all i do?
i'm just a ditz with a credit card?
no , no .
that's not what i meant .
it's just ... um ...
uh , th ...
you're ... young and beautiful and ...
and?
and , uh , well , what?
you think i'm beautiful?
mmm ... yeah , a little .
you know you're gorgeous , all right?
and popular and , uh , and ... but this is not why i come here .
this is a good learning experience for me .
you already said that .
mel .
i want to help out mel .
he's the only one who cares about me .
that's not true .
he's not?
no .
are you saying ... you care about me?
josh .
well , you can guess what happened next .
as if !
i am only 16 .
this is california , not kentucky .
you may kiss the bride .
i know that when i have my own wedding ,
i want this , like , whole , entire floral motif ,
like , very floral garlands .
no , no , no .
when i get married , i'll have a sailor dress , but it will be a gown .
my bridesmaids will wear sailor hats .
they're planning our weddings already .
could you all stop that till death do us part mumbo jumbo?
i'm completely buggin '.
i'm buggin 'myself .
girls , she's about to throw the bouquet !

we got a pool going to see whose girl gets the bouquet .
it's up to $200 .
