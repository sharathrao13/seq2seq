help here !
lend a hand !
anyone !
constable crane?
is that you?
none other .
not only me .
i found something which was lately a man .
burn it .
yes , sir .
we do not know the cause of death .
if found in the river , it is drowning .
we might determine whether he was dead before he went into the river .
i will need to examine the body .
cut him up?
are we heathens?
what happened to him?
arrested for burglary .
good work . he millennium is almost upon us .
in a few months , we will be living in the 19th century .
yet our courts rely on medieval methods of torture .
stand down !
i stand up , for sense and justice .
our jails overflow with men convicted on confessions worth no more ...
constable crane !
this is a song we have heard from you more than once .
there are two courses open to me .
first , i can let you cool your heels in the cells ,
until you learn respect for the dignity of my office ...
why am i the only one who sees that to solve crimes , detect the guilty ,
we must use our brains to find clues , using up to date scientific techniques?
which brings me to the second course .
there is a town upstate , two days to the north , in the hudson highlands .
it is a place called sleepy hollow .
have you heard of it?
i have not .
an isolated farming community , mainly dutch .
three persons have been murdered , all within a fortnight .
each one found with the head lopped off .
looped off?
clean as dandelion heads , apparently .
you will take your experimentations to sleepy hollow ,
and there you will detect the murderer .
bring him here to face our good justice .
will you do this?
i shall .
remember , it is you , ichabod crane ,
who is now put to the test .
the pickety witch , the pickety witch , who's got a kiss for the pickety witch?
is it theodore?
i am only a stranger .
then have a kiss on account .
i am looking for baltus van tassel .
i am his daughter , katrina .
we have not heard your name yet .
i have not said it .
excuse me .
you need some manners !
we'll have no raised voices .
it is to raise spirits in this dark time that i and my wife are giving this party .
you are welcome , even if you are selling something .
constable ichabod crane , sent from new york to investigate the murders .
then sleepy hollow is grateful to you .
we hope you will honour us by remaining in this house .
come sir , we'll get you settled .
play on !
excuse me .
thank you .
please tell mr. van tassel i will be down in a moment .
i will , sir .
thank god you're here .
ah , excellent , come in .
leave us , my dear .
we are joined by dr thomas lancaster , reverend steenwyck ,
our able magistrate samuel philipse ,
and lastly , this fine fellow is james hardenbrook , our notary .
and you , sir? .
a simple farmer who has prospered .
the town looks to me as friend and counsel .
and landlord and banker .
can we proceed?
thank you .
so , three persons murdered ...
first , peter van garrett ... ... and his son , dirk van garrett .
both of them strong , capable men ,
found together ... decapitated .
one week later , the widow winship .
also decapitated .
now , i will need to ask you many questions ,
but first let me ask , is anyone suspected?
how much have your superiors explained to you?
only that the three were slain in open ground ,
their heads found severed from their bodies .
their heads were not found severed .
their heads were not found at all .
the heads are gone?
taken .
taken by the headless horseman .
taken back to hell .
pardon , i don't ...
perhaps you had better sit down .
yes .
the horseman was a hessian mercenary ,
sent by a german princess to keep americans under the yoke of england .
but unlike his compatriots , who came for money ,
the horseman came for love of carnage .
when battle was joined , there you'd find him .
he rode a giant black steed named daredevil .
he rode hard into battle , chopping off heads at full gallop .
he had filed his teeth down to sharp points ,
to add to the ferocity of his appearance .
this butcher didn't finally reach his end until the winter of '79 .
not far from here , in our western woods .
they chopped off his head with his own sword .
even today the woods
is a haunted place , where brave men will not venture .
for what was planted in the ground that day
was a seed of evil .
and so it has been for 20 years .
but now the hessian wakes , cutting off heads where he finds them .
are you saying ...
is that what you believe?
seeing is believing .
they tell me you've brought books of scientific investigation .
this is the only book i recommend you read .
i see .
reverend steenwyck , gentlemen ...
murder needs no ghost to come from the grave .
we have murders in new york without benefit of ghouls and goblins .
you're far from new york .
the assassin is a man of flesh and blood , and i will discover him .
come out , devil .
his name's gunpowder .
he should do just fine .
thank you .
good luck , sir .
you need any help , you call my name .
don't you worry about a thing .
everything will be just fine .
thomas , inside !
run along for breakfast .
kiss your mother once for you and twice for me .
murder !
the horseman's killed again !
all right , gunpowder , we're off .
no , no , the other way .
good horse .
mr. miller , ride back for the coffin cart .
the rest of you , keep a sharp lookout .
it's all right .
i'm here now .
the fourth victim , jonathan masbath .
yes , i see .
and the head ..?
taken .
taken ...
interesting .
very interesting .
what is?
in cases like this , the head is removed to prevent identification of the body .
but we know this was masbath .
precisely .
so why was it removed?
why? .
right .
you have moved the body? .
you must never move the body !
why not?
because .
the stride is gigantic !
the attacker rode masbath down .
turned his horse .
came back to claim the head .
there's a chemical reaction .
it was a powerfull singular thrust to the neck .
interesting .
what is it?
the wound was cauterised , as though the blade were red hot .
and yet , no blistering , no scorched flesh .
the devil's fire .
be vigilant " , as it sayeth in the book of peter , chapter five , verse eight .
because your adversary , the devil , as a roaring lion , walketh about ,
seeking whom he may devour .
god rest , jonathan masbath .
mr. constable , sir .
you're young masbath .
i was young masbath , but now the only one .
masbath at your service .
in honour , bound to avenge my father .
well , i thank you very much , but your mother will need you more than l .
my mother is in heaven , sir .
she has my father now to care for her .
but you have no one to serve you .
i am your man , sir .
and a brave one , too .
but i cannot be the one to look after you .
i am sorry for your loss , young mr. masbath .
constable crane !
there's something you should know .
jonathan masbath was not the fourth victim , but the fifth .
the fifth?
aye .
five victims in four graves .
masbath , find a place in van tassel's servants 'quarters .
wake me at dawn .
i hope you have a strong stomach .
peter van garrett , dirk van garrett .
jonathan masbath .
five victims , four graves .
the widow winship .
bring the widow in .
this is most irregular , constable .
yes , but in this case necessary .
i need to operate immediately .
operate?
she's dead .
i mean , of course , i will need the operating table .
once more , the neck wound cauterised ,
the sword thrust to the stomach the same , but to what purpose?
to what is your purpose , is the question .
what type of instruments are these?
some of my own design .
step out , young masbath .
thank you for your help , mr. killian .
and if you don't mind , doctor ,
my concentration suffers greatly when i'm observed .
i am finished .
what have you done to her? .
we are dealing with a madman .
what did you find out?
the widow winship was with child .
who's there?
oh , pardon my intrusion .
there's no intrusion .
i come here to read when i'm wakeful .
to read books which you must hide .
they were my mother's books .
my father believes tales of romance caused the brain fever that killed her .
the nurse who cared for her during her sickness is now lady van tassel .
why did no one mention that the van garretts are kin to the van tassels?
hardly a household is not connected to every other by blood or marriage .
i see .
this was van garrett land , given to father when i wore swaddling clothes .
they were the richest family .
when my father brought me here ,
van garrett gave him an acre and a broken down cottage .
my father worked hard and prospered .
i owe van garrett my happiness .
i remember living poor in the cottage .
should i show you?
yes .
take this .
it is my gift for you .
no , i have no use for it .
are you so certain of everything?
it was your mother's .
it is sure protection against harm .
are you so certain of everything?
what are these strange markings?
i've had them since i can remember .
i used to play by this hearth as a child .
it was my first drawing school .
my mother was my teacher .
look .
see?
carved into the fireback .
the archer .
i'd forgotten it .
this was from long before we lived here .
are you all right?
yes , thank you .
a cardinal .
i'd love to have a tame one , but i wouldn't have the heart to cage it .
well , then i have something for you .
cardinal on one side , an empty cage .
and now ...
you can do magic .
teach me .
it is no magic .
we call it " optics " .
the pictures are joined in the spinning .
truth is not always appearance .
what are you running from , philipse?
you had a mind to help me .
yes , and it's put me in dread of powers against which there is no defense .
you knew the widow was expecting?
she told me .
and you are not the child's father? .
did she tell you the father's name?
yes .
she came to me for advice as town magistrate ,
to protect the rights of her child .
i was bound to keep the secret .
do you believe the father killed her? .
the horseman killed her .
there is no horseman .
there never was .
there never will be .
what is that thing?
my protection from the horseman .
a magistrate , full of such nonsense !
now tell me the name of ...
oh , my god !
constable crane?
has he not come out at all?
it was a headless horseman !
you must not excite yourself .
that's why you're here .
a horseman , a dead one , headless !
i know .
you don't .
you weren't there .
it's true !
of course it is .
i told you .
everyone told you .
i saw him .
i suppose it's back to the city , then .
this time i'll go to new york myself .
i won't be fobbed off with an amateur .
this time , a magistrate's dead .
gentlemen ...
i need able men to go with me into the western woods .
we thought you'd shot your bolt .
i will find the horseman's grave .
i will pit myself against a murdering ghost .
who's with me?
the van garretts , widow winship , your father , and now philipse .
something must connect them .
did your father deal with the van garretts?
he worked for them .
we lived in the coach house .
it's nothing .
there was an argument between father and son a week before the murder .
my father was later sent for by mr. van garrett .
an argument between father and son .
elder van garrett sent for his servant ...
listen .
i hear nothing .
nor l .
no birds , no crickets , it's all gone so quiet .
quicken pace .
pardon our intrusion , but perhaps you could help us .
you're from the hollow .
in a way , yes .
i make no assumptions about your occupation ,
nor your ways , which ... which ... which ... ... are nothing to me , whatever you are .
each to his own .
do you know of the horseman , ma'am?
the hessian?
that'll be him .
you , come with me .
go out , child .
keep away .
whatever you hear , keep away .
what might he hear that he must keep away from?
he rides to the hollow and back .
i hear him .
i smell the blood on him .
do you?
well , i'm here to find him and make him stop .
you seek knowledge of the netherworld .
i can show you .
what are you doing?
don't move or speak .
when the other comes , i will hold him .
the other? .
silence .
he comes now .
madam ...
madam , do you hear me?
you seek the warrior bathed in blood , the headless horseman .
follow the indian trail to where the sun dies , to the tree of the dead .
climb down to the horseman's resting place .
we're leaving .
we're leaving now .
to the tree of the dead .
how will we recognise it?
without difficulty , i fear .
then to the horseman's resting place .
his camp?
his grave .
stay here .
halt and turn , i have a pistol aimed !
katrina !
i might have killed you .
why have you come?
because no one else would go with you .
then i am now twice the man .
it is your white magic .
pardon my intrusion .
i think you'd better look at this .
the tree of the dead .
blood .
stay where you are .
what is it?
just stay where you are .
don't move .
this tree is a gateway between two worlds .
this ground has been disturbed .
the soil is loose .
bring the shovel .
the skull is gone .
taken .
that's why he returns from the grave .
to take heads until his own is restored to him .
ichabod?
split up .
glenn .
theodore .
don't pick your teeth , it's a bad habit .
i am a bad habit .
there's nothing for it .
oh , isn't there?
let's get ready for bed .
yes .
beth , run !
be quiet .
wait , he's not after you .
i'll get him .
we cannot win this .
remarkable .
a wound like this should have killed him ,
but it needs no stitch , and there's hardly a loss of blood .
you must be still .
the fever is on you .
katrina ...
nostradamus , mediamus , milk of mercy , in media nos laudamas .
katrina , i tried to stop brom ...
drink this down , it will make you sleep .
the horseman was not set to kill brom or me .
had brom not attacked him ...
later .
rest now .
the horseman doesn't kill at random .
his victims are chosen by that very person who took his skull .
someone who knew where to dig , of flesh and blood , as i've always said .
these are ravings .
drink .
ichabod ...
you were dreaming .
yes .
of things i had forgotten ... ... and would not like to remember .
tell me what you dreamt .
my mother was an innocent .
a child of nature .
condemned .
murdered ... by my father .
murdered by ..?
murdered to save her soul .
by a bible black tyrant , behind a mask of righteousness .
i was seven when i lost my faith .
what do you believe in?
sense and reason .
cause and consequence .
but here my rational mind has been so controverted by the spirit world .
you'll take nothing from sleepy hollow that was worth the coming here?
no , not nothing .
a kiss from a lovely young woman , before she saw me or knew my name .
yes , without sense or reason .
forgive me .
i speak of kisses , and you've lost your brave man brom .
i have shed my tears for brom ,
and yet my heart is not broken .
do you think me wicked?
no .
but perhaps there is a bit of witch in you .
why do you say that?
because you've bewitched me .
you slept like the dead .
you're too kind to me .
i don't look to be served by the lady of the house .
nor would you be , but that the servant girl has vanished .
sarah?
run away , like so many others .
they're all leaving in fear .
where is katrina?
she watched over you till dawn .
now it is her turn to sleep .
i'm fit for another day , i think .
fit enough to face a mortal adversary .
dr lancaster .
reverend steenwyck .
notary hardenbrook and magistrate philipse ... ... who tried to cut and run , and lost his head .
four frightened men arguing together on the very night philipse was killed .
there is conspiracy here .
the doctor , the reverend , the notary and the magistrate .
what is the secret that unites them?
magistrate philipse knew there were five bodies to four graves .
he knew the widow was pregnant and would not tell me the father's name .
what does this point to?
we must proceed by process of elimination .
i'll list everyone in town , starting with its chief citizen , baltus van tassel .
i feel we're getting very close .
yes ...
i suppose baltus is the chief citizen , now that old van garrett is dead .
the van garretts ...
i'd almost forgotten them .
come with me , to notary hardenbrook's .
have you thought of something?
yes ...
i have .
hopeless .
my father's satchel .
why is it here?
leave me alone .
notary hardenbrook ...
show me the last will and testament of old man van garrett .
the will leaves everything to his son .
who died with him .
the estate passes to the next of kin .
naturally .
all legal and above board .
sir? .
i'm a dead man .
no ...
van garrett's seal , broken .
he made a new will just before he died , naming ...
widow winship?
and here , look .
a marriage certificate .
he secretly married the widow and left everything to her and her unborn child .
it stood between van garrett's fortune and the one who'd have got everything .
it's true , but we four were drawn in against our will .
your will?
he means ...
of course , the four town elders .
now i see what parts you had to play .
steenwyck knew the secret .
he performed the marriage .
lancaster attended the pregnant woman .
philipse gave protection of the law .
hardenbrook concealed documents
entrusted by van garrett to his faithful servant .
the conspirators drawn into the plot .
we knew not it was a murdering plot .
but i have not finished , sir .
first , the van garretts slain by a horseman raised from the grave .
up pops a widow with a claim on the fortune .
off with her head .
but murder begets murder .
it was the servant ... ...
jonathan masbath .
the night father and son quarreled over the new will .
masbath was summoned upstairs to bear witness .
here is his signature .
i'm afraid it was his death warrant .
the horseman came for him .
came for him
at the bidding of someone who had power over him , who dug in the earth
and stole the skull , which must again be his before he will return to hell .
someone who stood to gain or lose a fortune .
none other
than van garrett's next of kin , baltas van tassel !
katrina , why are you in my room?
because it is yours .
was it wicked of me?
no , not at all .
i missed you .
where did you go?
i had questions to ask hardenbrook .
did you learn anything of interest?
perhaps .
my father ...
your father? .
yes .
my father thinks you should return to new york .
really? .
why is that?
perhaps he looked in your ledger and did not like what he saw .
what have you there?
evidence .
i'm sorry , i must ask you ...
then i'll leave you to your thoughts .
it's just a spider .
kill it !
no , stop it !
there's something under here .
what is it?
help me move the bed .
no , i mustn't .
you do it .
the evil eye .
it is someone casting spells against you .
the evil eye ...
wait here .
katrina ...
you burned the evidence .
so you would not accuse my father .
i accuse no one .
but if there is guilt , i cannot alter it , even if it grieves me .
no spells of yours can alter it , either .
it is he who profits from these murders .
if you knew him , you'd not have such harsh thoughts about him .
no .
nor if you felt anything for me .
why did his friends conceal ..?
you are the constable .
find another chain of reasoning and let me be .
i cannot .
nor the one or the other .
and i am heartsick with it .
i think you have no heart , and i had a mind once to give you mine .
yes , i think you loved me
when you followed me into the woods .
to have braved such peril .
what peril was there if it was my father who controlled the horseman?
goodbye .
i curse the day you came to sleepy hollow .
she will not see you .
did she say anything?
only that she will not come down .
i see .
thank you .
constable ...
you have not asked me how i hurt my hand since yesterday ,
which would have been polite .
in fact , you have been as careful not to look at it as not to mention it .
yes , i'm sorry .
how did you ..?
i know you saw me .
what?
i know you followed last night .
you must promise not to tell my husband what you saw .
promise me !
the town is in ferment !
horror piled on tragedy .
hardenbrook is dead !
that harmless old man?
hanged himself in the night .
hanged himself?
there's a church meeting tonight .
everyone is going to speak out against you .
if you are wise ,
you will leave this place .
what is that?
i was careless with the kitchen knife .
the wound looks angry .
i will bind it with arrowroot flowers .
i know where some grow .
hurry up , the meeting bell has started tolling .
the horseman !
katrina , the horseman saved me !
the horseman killed your stepmother !
oh , god !
you'll kill us all !
you're the one the horseman wants !
he cannot enter .
the horseman cannot enter !
he cannot cross the gate .
we have to save ourselves .
the next person to lay a hand on me will get a bullet !
he's coming back !
enough have died .
it's time to confess .
what is it that you know? .
your four friends played you false .
we were possessed by ...
stay back !
there's a conspiracy here , and i will seek it out !
it was an evil spirit possessed you .
i pray it is satisfied and that you find peace .
the evil eye has done its work .
my life is over .
spared for a lifetime of horrors in my sleep .
waking each day to grief .
goodbye , katrina .
you think it was katrina .
that can never be uttered .
a strange sort of witch , with a kind and loving heart .
how can you think so?
you are bewitched by reason .
i am beaten down by it !
it is a hard lesson for a hard world .
you'd better learn it .
villainy wears many masks .
none so dangerous as the mask of virtue .
farewell .
return the coach !
turn around now !
pardon my intrusion .
no blood flow , no clotting , no healing .
when this cut was made , this woman was already dead .
dear stepdaughter .
you look as if you'd seen a ghost .
rise up once more , my dark avenger .
one more night of beheading .
rise up with your sword .
a head for a head .
my unholy horseman , rise .
come now for katrina .
awake at last .
did you think it was a nasty dream?
father saw the horseman kill you .
he saw the horseman come towards me with his sword unsheathed ,
but it is i who govern the horseman , and baltus did not stay to watch .
but there was a body .
the servant girl , sarah .
i always thought she was useless ...
... but she had a purpose after all .
who are you?
my family name was archer .
the archer? .
i lived with my father , mother and sister in a cottage not far from here .
my father died , and the landlord , whom we'd served faithfully , evicted us .
no one would take us in , because my mother was suspected of witchcraft .
she schooled her daughters well , while we lived as outcasts in the woods .
she died within a year .
my sister and i remained in our refuge , seeing not a soul .
until one day , gathering firewood , we crossed the path of the messian .
i saw his death .
at that moment , i offered my soul to satan ,
if he would raise the hessian from the grave to avenge me .
avenge you?
against van garrett !
the landlord who showed us no mercy and left us to starve ,
whilst baltus and his simpering wife and girl child stole our home .
i swore i'd make myself mistress of all he had .
the easiest was to enter your house as your mother's sick nurse ,
and put her body into the grave , and my own into the marriage bed .
not quite so easy was to secure my legacy .
the widow had to go ,
and the servant masbath .
just the other day , that silly midwife killian
told me the widow had told her a big secret .
and she told me this right in front of her husband !
what a goose !
so , another little job for the horseman .
but lust delivered the rev. steenwyck into my power .
fear did the same for hardenbrook and the drunkard philipse .
and the doctor's silence i exchanged for my complicity
in his fornications with the servant girl sarah .
yes , you have everything now .
no , you have , my dear .
by your father's will .
i get everything in the event of your death .
oh , my sister , by the way , sadly passed away .
quite recently .
you killed your own sister .
she brought it on herself .
by helping you and your master !
you're just in time to have your head cut off .
tonight the horseman comes for you !
katrina !
thank god .
watch your head .
to the roof .
i have an idea .
jump in the sails !
jump !
hurry !
is he dead?
he was dead to begin with .
where are we going?
anywhere but here .
take the reins .
my bag !
jump !
still alive?
run , katrina .
yes , do run and jump and skip .
here , take her !
she's yours !
sir , you're not dead !
horseman !
just in time for a new century .
you'll soon get your bearings , young masbath .
the bronx is up , the battery's down , and home is this way .
engllsh
