after fifty years of bitter warfare the eastern federation has beaten europa's armies and taken control of the eurasian continent .
but pockets of resistance fighting the oppressive new regime , remain in eurasian zone seven .
the military mobilizes once again .
again , families must lose their sons .
i'm honored to present my findings to this forum of the health ministry .
gentlemen , as you know , we've beaten eurasia and brought it under control .
but the speed of our victory mustn't stop us looking within .
our nation's health is in crisis .
radioactivity ... industrial waste ... chemical weapons have poisoned us .
environmental diseases are epidemic and a threat to our future .
genetic mutations are rampant .
beyond the reach of current medicine .
allow me to present my findings .
these are " neo cells " , the fruit of my years of study .
i found them in the genome of a primitive ethnic group .
they can be converted into any cell to regenerate human tissue .
all of the internal organs , nerves , bone , skin , hair ... everything can be cultured and harvested at our convenience .
simply put .
spare parts " for the human machine .
with no risk of tissue rejection the medical technology of our dreams is finally at hand .
can we use it now?
with funding , it's a matter of time .
our clone work is years ahead of you !
it's just a theory !
father , must you listen further?
yes , it's theoretical but if i get funding and the facilities i need , we can save our people .
think of your children ... your parents ... and your wives .
luna ...
when the war ends , let's get married .
sure .
is this what we fought for?
fifty years of struggle to end up too exhausted to rebuild our society?
i read your paper .
human regeneration technology
a dream come true ... ... if it's possible .
it's definitely possible .
with more research , right?
professor azuma , those fools won't recognize your work .
in fact they daren't .
it's taboo to suggest , our original genes need improving .
pardon me .
i'm kaoru naito of nikko hairal inc .
we've already built a lab to host your research .
how come?
the military's taken an interest .
general kamijo?
the defense ministry is at your disposal .
sorry to hear your wife is unwell .
what're you getting at?
work with us ...
let all our dreams come true .
azuma residence
azuma residence dr. kozuki , move to the right .
dr. kozuki , move to the right .
that's it .
maybe place a hand on your daughter's shoulder?
okay , that's wonderful .
smile , please .
is your mind made up?
yes .
with your mother ill?
and what about luna?
i can't stay here while my friends are fighting .
you hate being a doctor that much?
it's my duty to my country .
you've no idea what war is like .
it can't be worse than cowardice .
darling ...
let's not fight today ...
forget it , mother .
go ahead , please .
luna ,
congratulations on your engagement .
thank you .
kozuki , excuse me .
my new lab opened last week .
one year later
eurasia , zone seven
shoot , shoot !
kill her .
do it or you're next .
understand?
midori ...
be patient .
i'm going to find a cure .
grenade !
eastern federation , defense ministry
eastern federation , defense ministry culture lab .
one moment , please .
dr. kozuki is downstairs .
bring him up .
up here?
that's right .
right away .
impressive security .
sorry for the sudden invite .
is luna with you?
she's in the lobby .
midori wanted to see you both .
a nice idea after so long .
she must get lonely .
has it been a year already?
thanks to my son ...
luna must be suffering .
still no word?
not to me , at least .
he went to war to spite me .
sons always defy their fathers .
he despises me .
i put my work before family but can't even cure my own wife .
isn't the neo cell treatment nearly ready?
it's incredible what you've done ...
usable?
no .
fixing wounded men with new organs ... makes my armor research redundant .
it's far from complete .
and i'm out of time .
is she that ill?
she's almost blind .
still doing research , though ...
there's selective leaf decay and darkening overall .
poor nutrition , perhaps?
how about the others?
here they are .
did you hear something?
no , i didn't .
i think someone just arrived .
i'm sorry .
would you go check?
certainly .
mother .
i'm home .
can you find a cure?
then , shouldn't you be with her?
i mustn't give up .
yes?
no ...
tetsuya .
i'm so glad you're home safely .
we must be thankful .
did you see luna , yet?
i'll see her soon .
you must .
she waited so long .
i know ...
i'm so forgetful .
they're coming for dinner tonight .
it'll be such a surprise .
ikegami san , ikegami san !
professor !
what's wrong?
my son ... he's dead ...
september 16th , sergeant azuma , made the final sacrifice ,
losing his life in duty for god and country .
a most ... a most noble and heroic end .
after posthumous promotion , he'll be buried tomorrow .
tetsuya !
a state funeral with full military honors .
you may view the body tonight .
please get ready .
luna ...
i messed up ; now you're alone .
we had all the time in the world , so i took you for granted .
i know it's too late , now ... but i'll never leave your side again .
his body's on the way here .
the funeral's tomorrow .
did you tell midori?
she already knows .
warning
malfunction !
pressure overload .
cause unknown !
osmosis tank failure !
shut down the vacuum feed .
what's going on?
what the hell's that?
culture fluid's transforming .
what the ...
the neo cells ...
it's the neo cells .
organs are recombining .
professor , what's going on?
what the ...?
what is it?
code 206 , code 206 !
it's me , naito !
get in here , now !
professor , let's go !
open up !
we're still in here !
they're coming ...
go secure the overflow !
hold up !
set up an outside perimeter .
who said we take orders from you?
the whole project's my responsibility .
grunts shut up and do as they're told .
all of you , outside !
get me h. q.
luna ...
what happened?
naito here .
i'm inbound .
i'll report when i get in .
mother ...
tetsuya ...
they're escaping by vehicle .
with a hostage .
seal off eurasian zone three .
where's my wife?
hold on , my dear .
azuma .
what's going on?
are you out of your mind?
your son is dead .
i don't want to come back .
please .
stop !
give me a hand .
how on earth can this be?
you can escape through that door .
look after tetsuya .
you mustn't die .
hold on !
don't die .
don't die .
dear god ...
what have you done?
what?
foreign agitators are still at large .
heavily contaminated with infection , please report their presence .
let's see i. d.
please proceed .
it seems they're heading for zone seven .
kozuki residence .
this is the body armor i developed .
it completely shields the soldier and lets him move like lightning .
tetsuya's muscle is so over developed he may tear himself apart .
we must contain the internal pressure .
sekiguchi !
hold on !
sekiguchi , don't die !
mother ... ... you so hated the war .
wondered when it would end ...
how many would have to die ...
if peace would ever come ...
we live !
against all odds , we survived .
did men recognize our right to life?
no .
they murdered our brothers .
as if they had the right to judge .
as if they deserved such power .
we have equal right to life .
it can't be rationed .
nor denied at birth .
no way .
of course it can't !
but man presumed to judge us .
if they claim this right , then so can we ...
we'll have our revenge .
we'll build a kingdom here .
live our lives to the full and do what we must .
let us be called " neo sapiens
we hereby vow
to eliminate mankind .
we are the neo sapiens .
bow down before us .
are we ready for the next offensive?
yes .
two divisions are standing by .
intelligence reports eleven scientists in the target area .
roboticians , nuclear physicists and an armor specialist .
perfect for our new factory .
is it ready?
bring me those scientists .
let them contribute to our power .
forget it .
reports indicate military scientists being abducted to work in robot factories .
our military is strengthening defense of civilian installations .
that's as much as i can do .
it's not perfect but it'll stop him bursting apart .
father?
dr. kozuki , armor specialist .
he's ours now .
puny human .
tetsuya?
my boy ...
my boy ...
fate has something in store for you .
it's going to be tough .
but ...
there's got be a reason for it .
there must be ...
you must seek out your destiny .
luna .
i'm sorry .
never look back .
father !
tetsuya , get up .
come on .
tetsuya , wake up !
where is she? !
who the hell are you?
where is my mother? !
you're supposed to be dead .
tetsuya ...
stop .
stop !
get lost !
move !
go away , freaks !
are your " neo cells " ready?
i can't afford to wait .
what use are you , if you can't deliver?
no more excuses , naito .
as selfish as ever .
all you think about is yourselves .
how dare you !
old farts saving their own skins .
even for the general's son , this is unforgivable .
our nation faces the neo sapien threat yet your only worry is your health?
that's unforgivable .
son .
you know this is treason?
of course .
the eastern federation is now mine .
sorry .
the era of brain dead idiots is over .
son !
satisfied , now?
commander kamijo .
let me introduce
professor azuma .
father of the neo sapiens?
why did you lie to him?
that's strange .
i thought you'd be pleased .
i didn't create them .
i don't know how they came to life .
it's too late to claim ignorance .
they grow stronger by the day .
if we don't find their weakness , learn how to fight them ... our own lives may be in danger .
keep up your research .
in return , the army will find your wife .
stick to the story , old chap .
don't rock the boat .
your time has come at last .
why must people always fight?
who did this?
we're hurt , so we hurt in turn ...
we're killed , so we kill in turn ...
endless repetition .
i can see it .
what must i do?
what can you see?
a vision ... of how it might've been ...
and now ... my own father killed ...
what should i do?
what would be best?
of peace ...
shall i get a gun and kill?
if it'd taken away the pain .
should i fight , too?
stop talking nonsense .
but you fought?
it's my duty .
you wanted to go to war .
you've no idea what war is like ...
you've no idea what war is like .
you've no idea what war is like .
