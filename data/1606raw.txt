it must have been pretty rough .
i would have called you a lot sooner , but i was out at sea .
i've been calling you for four months .

i'm at sea three weeks of every month .
when i'm back in port ,
i don't have time for this daddy stuff .
that's ok , sir .
you don't understand .
i'm too old for this .
i don't care what the navy says .
this is no place for kids .
like i said on the telephone , you're better off in virginia .
i'm never going back !
maybe that's not for you to say !
god dammit !
don't look at me that way !
what happened to your mother had nothing to do with me .
it did !
you said you'd come back !
you promised !
that's what she said?
that's a female lie .
that's bullshit !
i found your letters and read them after she did it !
you said you loved her , and she believed you !
you're a liar !
hurry , grow up , boy .
i'll wait for you .
cherry boy .
you want to go to school?
i'll teach you nice .
chicken feet , monkey meat .
come on , you buy .
you buy .
monkey meat .

no !
leave me alone !
leave me alone .
holy shit .
watch it .
i got to heave .
jesus christ .

pretty fuckin 'wild .
holy shit .

bet you didn't get it on like that in that jerkwater college of yours .
how long you going to hang around seattle?
get ready .
this one will blow you away .
nothing you do is ever going to surprise me .

that's right , i did .
i'm on my way to port rainier , this officer's training school over there .
what for?
jets .
i want to fly jets .
this place is only a couple of hours from here .
maybe you'll want to visit me sometime , right?
who put that idea in your head?
nobody .
just come to me .
what's so funny?
you , man .
it's like saying you're running for president .
christ , look at yourself .
officers don't have tattoos .
look , i'll see you , man , all right?
yeah .
zack , come on , don't be pissed off .
i'm not pissed off .
you are pissed off .
i'm on your side .
i don't want to see you do something you'll regret .
you got to give up six fucking years of your life if you want to fly .
six fucking years , with the most uptight assholes on earth .
officers aren't like you and me .
they're a different breed .
this sounds like you're afraid you might have to salute me someday .
why would i be afraid to salute you?
i don't know .
it sounds that way .
you want some fatherly bullshit a pat on the back .
from you?
no .
no .

hey , babe .
zack !

i said fall in , you slimy worms !
put your toes on that chalk line !
i said put your toes on the chalk line , you slimy worms !
i don't believe what i'm seeing .
where you been all your lives , at an orgy?
listening to mick jagger music and bad mouthing your country , i'll bet .
stop eyeballing me .
you're not worthy to look your superiors in the eye .
use your peripheral vision .
understand?
yes , sir .
when i say " understand " , i want the group to say , " yes , sir !
understand?
yes , sir !
understand?
yes , sir !
i know why most of you are here .
i'm not stupid .
before you get to sell what we teach you over at united airlines , got to give the navy six years of your life , sweet pea .
lots of things can happen in six years .
another war could come up .
if you're too peaceful a person to napalm an enemy village , where there are women and children , i'm going to find that out .
understand?
yes , sir !
understand?
yes , sir !
hi , son .
how you doing , sarge?
what did you call me?
beg your pardon?
what did you call me , boy?
sarge .
before that .
nothing before that .
you said , " how are you?
a ewe is a female sheep .
is that what you think i am , boy?
no .
no , sir !
no , sir .
louder , sweet pea !
no , sir !
you want to fuck me?
that's why you called me a ewe?
are you a queer?
hell no , sir !
where you from , boy?
oklahoma city , oklahoma , sir .
only two things come out of oklahoma .
steers and queers .
which one are you , boy?
i don't see no horns .
you must be a queer .
no , sir .
stop whispering .
you're giving me a hard on .
no , sir !
you laughing at me , dickbrain?
no , sir !
stop eyeballing me , or i'll rip your eyeballs out and skullfuck you to death .
yes , sir !
what's your name , boy?
mayo .
zack mayo , sir !
how did you slip into this programme?
i didn't know the navy was so hard up .
you got an injury there , mayo?
not exactly , sir .
hey , this is really wonderful work .
where did you get this , mayo?
subic base , philippines , sir .
thought i recognised the work .
be proud of them wings .
they're the only ones you're going to leave here with , mayo nnaise !
what's your name , boy?
emiliano santos della serra , sir .
you don't say?
you a college boy , della serra?
yes , sir !
math major , sir .
graduated from texas tech with honours , sir !
i see .
you see this cane , della serra?
see the notches near the handle?
there's a notch for every college puke like you that i got to dor .
that's drop on request from this program .
the first one i'm going to call out of this class is you , emiliano .
i expect to lose half of you before i'm finished .
i will use every means necessary , fair and unfair , to trip you up , to expose your weaknesses as a potential aviator and as a human being , understand?
yes , sir !
the price at the other end is a flight education worth $1 million !
but first , you got to get past me !
hey , paula !
it's 5 : 00 !
where's the goddamn whistle?
oh , shit !
come on , paula .
let's go !
turn that thing off !
next !
oh , shit .
what is that?
this is my idea of an ass bandit .
wait till the girls see you , scrotumhead .
scrotumhead !
think that's funny , don't you , boy?
not all the obstacles that can trip you up are on this base .
let me tell you something about the local girls .
ever since there's been a base here , there's been what you'd call the puget sound debs .
the poor girls come across the sound on the ferry every weekend with just one thing in mind , and that's to marry themselves a naval aviator .
a puget deb will tell you ,
don't you worry about contraceptives .
i've got that all taken care of .
don't believe it , sweet pea .
a puget deb will do anything and say anything to trap you .
i know this sounds silly , especially in this so called modern age , but you scuzzy college pukes should watch out , because they're out there , and you , sweet peas , are the answer to their dream !
hurry up !

heads up , perryman .
when you hit the water , you might get the wind knocked out of you .
don't panic .
you've got a second and a half before the cage is completely underwater and upside down .
go , joe !
now , the most important thing is to watch your bubbles .
when that cage flips upside down , you'll be disoriented .
you won't know what your bearings are , like perryman down there .
the bubbles determine which way is up .
all right , time's up .
go down for him .
this is what happens if you panic .
you can die there , and this is a pool .
out in the pacific , you won't have a frogman to save your ass .
totally unsatisfactory , perryman .
do it again .
two more chances to make it , or you're out .
all right .
next !
hold it .
change in order .
mayo ... since you're hotshot of the week , you're next .
aye , aye , sir .
seeger , you're behind him .
yes , sir .
you ought to be good at this , mayo .
something you can do alone .
take him up !
you never know when you'll trip up , mayo .
it could be some character flaw that comes out under stress .
let's go , joe !
all right !
way to go !
ok , seeger .
you're next .
all right , seeger , let's go .
get a move on .
joe , take her up !
don't you cry , sugar britches !
go , joe !
all right , seeger !
all right .
gosh , that was great !
think they'd let us do it again?
not bad , seeger .
but you still got to get over that wall .
next !
daniels , move it .
it's just a joy ride .
does this hit with a plane's impact?
it's nothing compared to a plane .
don't forget to watch the bubbles .
take him up !
all right , daniels .
let's have that thumbs up .
come on .
where's the thumbs up at?
all right .
go , joe !
take it easy .

in this class , that happens to be you ... isn't it , mayonnaise?

get into your fatigues , mayo .
by the end of this weekend , you'll quit .
casey jones was a son of a bitch !
drove his train in a 30 foot ditch !
came on out with his dick in his hand
said , " listen , ladies , i'm a hell of a man .
went to his room and lined up 100 .
swore up and down he'd fuck every one .
fucked 98 till his balls turned blue .
then he backed off , jacked off , and fucked the other two !
wave goodbye to your buddies .
i forgot .
you don't have buddies .
only customers .
you having fun , mayonnaise?
yes , sir !
don't hear you !
yes , sir !
all right !
98 ...
99 ...
get your face all the way down in there !
100 .
ready to quit now , mayo?
no , sir !
look over there , mayo .
look at her .
she decided to stay instead of taking liberty this weekend .
she may not make it , but she's got more heart and character than you'll ever have !
and stop eyeballing me , boy !
life's dealt you some shitty cards , hasn't it?
i'm doing all right , sir !
6 ...
bullshit .
i done some checking .
i looked through your files .
i know about your mama .
don't you eyeball me .
i know your father's an alcoholic and a whore chaser .
that's why you don't mesh , mayo .
because deep down ...
don't you eyeball me , boy !
deep down inside ... you know the others are better than you !
isn't that right , mayo?
no , sir !
no , sir !
what's the matter?
you getting tired?
i'm not tired .
move it , boy !
this is where the fun starts !
move it !
you got all day tomorrow to look forward to !
6 inches off the ground .
give me 6 to 90 .
hey , mayo , why don't we quit this little charade over a couple of beers at tj's?
you're as close to being officer material as me .
this candidate believes he would make a good officer !
you only give a shit about yourself .
all your classmates know it .
do you think they would trust you behind the controls of a plane?
you'd probably zipp off in my f 14 and sell it to the cubans .
no , sir !
no , sir !
i love my country .
sell it to the air force , mayo .
why would a slick hustler like you sign up for this abuse?
i want to fly jets .
my grandmama wants to fly jets .
i've always wanted it !
we're not talking about flying .
we're talking about character .
i've changed , sir .
the hell you have .
i've changed , sir !
you've just polished your act .
you've shined it up !
tell me what i want to hear .
i want your dor .
i ain't going to quit .
spell it !
d o r. i ain't gonna quit !
then you and your daddy can get drunk and go whore chasing together !
no , sir !
i ain't going to quit !
then forget it .
you're out !
don't you do it !
don't ... you ...
i got nowhere else to go !
i got nowhere else to go !
i ain't got nothing else .
i got nothing else .
all right , mayo .
on your feet .
come on , mayo , let's get back to the barracks .
hey , foley !
zack , don't give up !
you got that queer on the run !
kiss this , foley !
hang in there , zack !
remember the tides lnn .
those friends of yours?
don't give up , mayo !
yes , sir .
we're with you , zack !
zack , you can make it !
you got some urinals to clean .
move out .
hey , foley's queer !
he got his balls shot off in the war !
you're still here , mayo?
sid .
yeah?
thanks .
sid .
look at that .
that son of a bitch .
want me to get a towel?
i'll get one .
i don't want you to move .
somebody's got to move sometime ... eventually .
they found them there weeks later ,
shrivelled from lack of food and water .
bye , zachary .
i laughed all week , thinking about you guys on that boat .
we were so drunk .
pretty sharp , paula .
pretty sharp .
i'd love to be one of those girls they're letting in the flight programme .
it would be a gas to fly .
what's stopping you?
you know what those magazines say .
it's just ...
i don't know .
it's not so easy for a girl .
that's still no excuse for not getting what you want .
just go get it .
who says i'm not going after what i want?
not me .
my mama's 39 years old .
she still works over at that factory .
every time i look at her , i know exactly what i don't want .
my old lady ... took a bottle of pills one day when i was at school .
oh , god .
the thing that got me about it ...
she didn't leave a note .
she didn't ...
nothing .
she just checked out .
i always hated her for that .
oh , god .
that must really hurt .
hurt?
no .
no .
you're all alone in the world .
once you got that down , nothing hurts anymore .
i bet most people buy that line when you feed it to them .
hey , are you really serious about having him over?
i haven't made up my mind yet .
paula ... just how far would you go to get zack?
what do you mean?
you know what i mean .
would you let yourself get pregnant?
no way , lynette .
would you?
well ... l never used to think i'd do something like that .
but i don't know anymore .
nine weeks just ain't long enough for a guy to fall in love with you .
that doesn't justify trapping him or getting pregnant .
i can't believe you'd think that .
it's real backward .
it ain't any more backward than the way these hotshot assholes use us till they've had enough , then ditch us like we's trash .
don't you ever feel used , paula?
don't you feel the sons of bitches ought to be paying for our troubles?
no .
i never feel like that .
well , i do .
thanks again for the flowers , zack .
it was my pleasure .
those are the most beautiful things i've ever saw .
wipe that stuff off your mouth .
zack?
this is great .
sir?
how many more weeks till graduation?
three more .
three more weeks .
those are the roughest , aren't they?
that's what they tell me .
sir , why are you staring at my food?
or are you staring at me?
staring at you .
he doesn't mean anything by it .
do you , joe?
no , i don't mean anything by it .
like some more chicken , zack?
no .
no , thanks .
i've had it .
i can't eat another bite .
i'm stuffed , too .
this is the best meal i've had in a long time .
let's go , zack .
thank you , mama .
thank you , zack .
thanks again , ma'am .
go on and eat .
mama , mama , mama !
i'm sorry .
i'm so embarrassed , zack .
i shouldn't have brought you here .
that's ok .
a great free meal .
a nice , relaxing dinner .
those people are so uptight .
i felt so sorry for you .
don't .
i'm used to it .
it's hereditary .
after this , you go to basic flight which is in pensacola , right?
yeah , pensacola .
and ... going to beeville , texas , when i get jets .
so , after that ... don't you think about ...
i mean , come on ...
what's after that?
family , kids ...
don't you think about all that?
no .
is that what you think about?
sometimes .
if i could do a better job than them , i'd love it .
and what would you do different?
everything .
first , i'd marry a man i really loved .
so why did your mom marry this guy if she didn't love him?
my real father wouldn't marry her .
your real father?
my real father .
i want to show you my real father .
pop .
your real father was an officers candidate like me?
about 22 years ago .
jesus .
no wonder this guy was looking at me funny .
he always looks funny .
it's about time i got back to the wars .
yeah , i know , i know .
thank your mom for dinner , ok?
great chicken , huh?
i loved the chicken .
if you get a chance , why don't you call me?
i have survival training this week , so i can't make any promises .
no promises .
i didn't have to show you that picture if i didn't want to .
i wanted to tell you that .
i know .
bye , baby .
be careful on that .
yeah .
you and paula still seeing those flight candidates?
any reason we wouldn't be?
it's 3 : 40 and you haven't said what you're doing this weekend .
hi .
i'd like to speak with zack mayo .
he's an aoc candidate .
could you look for him?
tell him it's paula .
liberty time , boys and girls .
fall out !
aye , aye , sir !
where you going?
where's my bread?
forget that thing .
come on , perryman .
come on .
seeger , don't forget tj's .
i won't .
hey , mayo !
you got a phone call .
somebody named paula .
tell her i already split .
i see .
ok .
comes a time right after survival training , they start thinking they can make it without you .
suddenly , they stop calling .
suddenly , they own the goddamn world .
they said that he already left .
i don't think he did .
he hasn't called by now , he won't call .
bunny , just shut up !
you don't know so much .
clock me out , lynette .
paula , what are you doing?
may they all crash and burn .
paula , wait !
where are you going?
let me go , mama .
you're going to look for zack .
don't do it .
i love him .
i can't let him go .
how will you stop him?
i don't know , but i'll think of a way .
no !
no?
i can't let you do this .
don't go .
please , don't go .
what are you crying about?
cos i know what you're feeling !
what am i feeling?
don't do it .
let him go .
don't trick him or trap him .
i wouldn't do that .
i'd never try to trap him .
if you find him , you'll say anything .
you will .
and god help you after that .
mama , you're right .
daddy , zack's 2/ 10 of a second off the obstacle course record .
he'll break it before he leaves .
lucky you weren't in the programme when i was .
you couldn't quit the way you can now .
when i and my oldest boy went through it , you bilged out , you became a swabby .
that's real interesting , sir .
how come you haven't written susan in over three weeks?
we haven't had time to write anybody .
i've only written y'all once .
it's incredible .
right?
yeah .
who is this susan?
my girl back home .
i'm marrying her as soon i get out of here .
she was tommy's girl .
they were supposed to get married before he got killed .
i didn't want you to think i was a shit for fucking lynette .
man , i ain't your parents .
do you love this girl?
greatest chick you'll ever know .
she loves kids .
works with handicapped kids every afternoon .
that ain't what i'm talking about .
i asked you if you loved her .
everybody loves her .
i won't make that reunion tonight .
why not?
i'm meeting lynette at the tides .
best head in 52 states .
what can i do?
no , no , no .
you should've done what i did ... break it off clean , have it done with , over .
it's the best .
she was torn up you didn't call her .
i'm not supposed to tell you that .
women .
women , women , women .
they say , " a lot of laughs , no problems .
doesn't work that way , does it?
look out , tj's !
here i come .
see you later , man .
i don't know what you're smiling about , perryman .
you're lucky you're here .
what are you talking about?
i still taste that bug .
a toast .
we made it .
to survival .
to survival .
to survival .
in spite of perryman .
in spite of foley .
is that your deb over there?
she's pulling rank on you .
that's a flight instructor .
back in a minute .
what are you doing here?
it was time for me to see the legendary tj's once before i left here .
you come here a lot?
i come here once in a while .
i'm sorry i didn't call you this weekend .
this week has been unbelievable .
it's ok .
how did the survival training go?
i survived .
you survived .
obviously .
how was your week?
it was good .
i'm getting a raise beginning of next month .
that's great .
you're graduating in a couple weeks?
yeah .
i'm starting to believe i'll make it .
you'll make it .
i told you you saw it , and it happened .
yeah , you told me .
i got to go , i have a date .
so ...
look , there's something i wanted ...
what?
i ... l wanted to thank you .
i wouldn't have made it through this crazy thing if i didn't have something to look forward to .
don't thank me for nothing .
i had a good time .
good luck in pensacola with your flight training , and ...
get jets , huh?
i'll see you , zack .
give me another one .
in fact , give me the bottle .

come over here .
sit down for a second .
i'll tell you something .
had to have one more taste .
this stuff come in anything besides strawberry?
i'll bring some coconut next time .
sid ... l've really got to go .
shouldn't you have got your period by now?
i'm a little late , that's all .
how late are you?
why?
what's the difference?
if anything happened , it would be my responsibility .
now , just exactly how late are you?
what do you care?
suppose i was to get pregnant .
just suppose .
i'd never make you do something you didn't want to do .
i know .
but that's not the only issue here .
there's more to it than that .
what other issue is there , sid?
my responsibility as its father , for one thing .
if i've got you pregnant , i'll do the right thing by you .
i'll pay for the abortion , be with you through it , comfort you .
we'd go through it together .
so how late are you?
let's just wait and see what happens , ok?
see you later .
i'll call you .
fuck !
last chance for the record !
go !
this is it , mayonnaise .
go !
come on !
go for it , mayo !
go get it !
you got it !
go , mayo !
push it !
put your name on that wall !
mike , let's catch that animal !
let's do this together , seeger .
come on , seeger .
forget it , just go for the record .
come on !
you got it !
come on , man !
hey !
where you going?
seeger , get up .
forget it .
you want jets?
then get up !
you're going over !
right here !
three steps .
right , left , right .
hand over hand .
walk the wall .
come on , seeger .
ready?
let's go !
left , right , pull !
walk that wall , seeger !
walk it !
hand over hand !
hand over hand !
walk it !
walk it !
walk the wall !
seeger !
seeger , walk !
seeger !
don't you let go !
you walk that wall !
pull !
pull !
pull , candidate seeger !
pull !
one leg !
you got it !
pull over !
pull over !
pull yourself over !
all right !
where's sid?
what makes you think she's not lying?
she went to a doctor .
she's pregnant .
so get an abortion .
i'd love to , believe me .
she won't even talk about it .
she's catholic .
you're not marrying this girl .
if i don't , she'll have the baby on her own somewhere .
women do it all the time .
i can't let her have a kid by herself .
it's my kid , too .
you sure?
it's mine .
i'm sorry , all right?
what if foley was right?
she got knocked up to trap you .
is it still your responsibility?
that's not the point .
no matter how it happened , the child would still be mine .
i wouldn't know where it was or nothing .
jesus christ !
ls everything your responsibility?
sit .
adjust .
pray .
attack .
it's like your brother getting killed .
it's the same damn thing him getting killed instead of you .
that's why you promised to marry susan .
you do everything out of some bullshit code of ethics .
it may be bullshit to you , but i wasn't raised that way !
we're responsible for the people in our lives .
that's all that separates us from the animals !
i'm not like you , mayo .
i can't shit on people and sleep at night .
i say you're responsible to yourself first .
if you can't handle that , you got bigger problems than making some girl pregnant !
gentlemen , relax .
without an oxygen mask at 30, 000 feet , your insides will feel like this rubber glove .
your coordination deteriorates .
even the most childlike exercises seem impossible .
look for the warning signs giddiness , shortness of breath , claustrophobia .
they can hit you at any moment .
the instant you feel yourself losing control , go back on oxygen .
that's the purpose of this drill .
does everyone understand the exercises?
ok , everybody set?
let's see a thumbs up , please .
very good .
everybody remove your mask , please .
all right .
begin the exercises now .
queen of diamonds .
nine of diamonds .
if you have any problems , put your mask on .
if you can't , raise your hand , and the corpsman will assist you .
how you doing , mayo and seeger?
having a little trouble?
concentrate .
try to make your palms meet .
ace of spades .
how you doing down there , worley?
worley , are you all right?
worley , can you hear me?
ace of spades .
worley , put your mask back on , please .
put your mask back on !
sid , you ok?
sid !
i got to get out .
worley , sit down .
corpsman , we got a problem .
i got to get out of here !
corpsman , get that mask on .
it's all right .
get out of here !
it's all right .
breathe !
breathe !
mayo , they're watching !
we're going to stabilise the pressure .
it's ok .
all right .
everything's ok .
everybody's watching you .
hold on .
we'll stabilise the pressure now .
man the doors .
one minute .
stay where you are .
leave your masks on !
he's got it .
he's fine .
he's ok .
no problem .
he's ok .
colours !
secure the halyard !
charlie , take care of that .
what's going on?
you didn't kick him out?
did he tell you what he's been going through?
it doesn't matter .
what does matter is that he freaked out at 25, 000 feet .
that can't happen ever .
he's got a girl who's pregnant .
that don't matter .
don't matter?
you've got two weeks left !
that can happen to you , too , mayonnaise .
he ain't bullshitting you , buddy .
i'm talking to you , motherfucker !
don't fuck for you !
what did you call me?
i thought the dl's were supposed to help .
what kind of a human being are you?
lock it up or you'll go with him .
go back to the barracks .
please?
i don't get this .
he's the best candidate in the class !
the best student , the best leader ... the best friend to everybody .
can't you bend your goddamn rules?
he didn't ask me to dor .
i went to him .
what are you talking about?
i'm glad it's over .
i was here for everybody but me .
i was here for my big brother .
hey , buddy .
sid , wait a minute .
sid !
request permission to carry on ...
sir !
get the fuck out of here .
yes , sir .
keep the change .
thanks , pal .
lynette !
hi , baby .
hi , sid .

what are you doing out of uniform?
i got something .
wait .
i look a mess .
all right , then .
if you don't want it ...
all right .
what?
well , if you don't want it .
what?
oh , my god !
oh , my god .
it's beautiful !
it cost my savings , but what the fuck?
oh , god !
sid !
so ... does this mean ...
yes , ma'am !
that's what it means !
oh , sid !
let's do it right now !
i wonder where we'll get stationed?
i've always wanted to go to hawaii !
honey , we're not being stationed anywhere .
i dor'd .

i dor'd .
i wasn't cut out to be a pilot .
i was faking it .
i've been faking everything up to now .

where would we go?
oklahoma .
i'll get my old job back at jc penney's .
hell , in two years , i'll be floor manager .
you're going to love oklahoma .
you and mama will get along great .
money might be tight , so we'll live at home .
it's going to work out .
sid ...
there's no baby .
what?
i'm not pregnant .
i got my period this morning .
there's no baby , sid .
i'll be goddamned .
what do you say we get married anyway?
i love you !
i don't think i really knew that till just now , just this second .
i have never been happier in my life than i have in the last seven weeks .
i've never felt so relaxed , and i've never felt so loved for who i really am .
lynette , marry me .
make me the happiest man in the whole world .
i'm sorry , sid .
but i don't want to marry you .
i really like you , and we've had ourselves some really great times , but i thought you understood .
