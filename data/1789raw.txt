maybe when you have children who need braces and half of your husband's pay cheque goes to the government , you'll regret that .
my husband's pay cheque?
i'm not squeezing one out till i'm 30 .

# i wanted to be with you alone

there would be headlines in the papers .
the grown up gangs who ran the betting at the wrestling and the barrow boys
would hear with respect of how 0ld misery's house had been destroyed .
it was as though this plan had been with him all his life , pondered through the seasons ,
now , in his 15th year , crystallised with the pain of puberty .
what is graham greene trying to communicate with this passage?
why did the children break into 0ld misery's house?
joanie?
they wanted to rob him .
if you had actually read the short story , which was a whopping 13 pages , you'd know that the children find a great deal of money in the mattress , but burn it .
donnie darko , perhaps with your recent brush with mass destruction , you can give us your opinion .
they say it when they flood the house , when they tear it to shreds , that destruction is a form of creation , so burning the money is ironic .
they just want to see what happens when they tear the world apart .
they want to change things .
may we help you?
yeah , i just registered .
they put me in the wrong class .
you look like you belong here .
um ...
where do i sit?
sit next to the boy you think is the cutest .
quiet !
let her choose .
joanie , get up .
what people don't understand is that dukakis does not have the financial infrastructure ...
well , the construction guys say it will take about a week to fix the roof .
airline better not fuck us on the shingle match .
they still don't know?
know what?
where it came from?
0h , no .
they can't tell us .
something about a matching serial number that got burned .
i had to sign a form saying i wouldn't talk to anyone about it .
so we can't tell anyone what nobody knows?
yeah .
but you tell ...
what's your doctor's name?
dr thurman , dad .
yes .
tell dr thurman whatever you want .
dad .
what?
dad !
0h ... !
what's that woman doing in the middle of the damn road? !
no mail today .
maybe tomorrow .
what did she say to you?
i made a new friend .
real or imaginary?
imaginary .
would you like to talk about this friend?
frank .
frank .
what did he say?
he said to follow him .
follow him?
where?
into the future .
and then what happens?
and then he said ... then he said that the world was coming to an end .
do you think the world is coming to an end?
no .
that's stupid .
for my entire life , i was a victim of my own fear .
love .
i was feeding fear with food .
fear .
finally , i looked in the mirror .
not just in the mirror .
i looked through the mirror .
ln that image , i saw my ego reflection .
for two years , i thought it was normal for a 10 year old to wet the bed ...
shh !
quiet !
but the solution was there all the time .
l'm not afraid any more !
all over america , people have come together to join hands .
people who believe that human life is absolutely too important , too valuable and too precious to be controlled by fear .
pay close attention .
you could miss something .
hello .
my name is jim cunningham .
and welcome to " controlling fear " .
.. and the prince was led into a world of strange and beautiful magic .
wow .
the last unicorn " by samantha darko .
give it back !
" there was once a unicorn named ariel ...
you wrinkled it .
it's not wrinkled , sam .
it's 7 . 45 .
the bus should've been here 20 minutes ago .
maybe martha finally went nuts and hijacked it .
there's this rule at 7 . 45 , we get to go home .
there's no rule .
cherita , you should ... go home .
yeah , if you're here when the bus comes , we'll get in trouble .
shut up !
" shut up !
hey , porky pig ... i hope you get molested .
hey !
hey !
i can't believe this !
school's closed today because it's flooded .
no way !
yeah .
holy shit !
that's the best news ever !
my god , is this ever going to stop?
eventually , yes .
but right now , i got 12 classrooms full of water .
all coming from a busted water main .
what else?
what else?
principal cole , i'll show you what else .
that's unbelievable .
that's solid bronze , isn't it?
yep .
how did this happen?
i heard a cat burglar trashed everything and the mongrel got his head cut off .
hah !
true !
beth's mom said the boys 'locker room flooded and they found faeces everywhere .
what are faeces?
baby mice .
hey .
has anyone ever told you that you're sexy?
i like your boobs .
hey .
hey .
school's cancelled .
do you want to walk me home?
sure .
don't look so freaked .
i'm not .
check your backpack .
those guys steal shit .
fuck 'em !
so , why'd you move here?
my parents got a divorce .
my mom got a restraining order against my stepdad .
he has emotional problems .
i have those , too .
what kind does he have?
he stabbed my mom four times in the chest .
0h .
did he go to jail?
no , he fled .
they still can't find him .
mom and i had to change our names .
i thought gretchen ross was pretty cool .
i was in jail once .
i mean ...
i burned down this house .
it was abandoned , but i got held back in school and i can't drive till i'm 21 .
but i'm over all of that .
i'm ... painting and stuff .
writing .
i want to be a writer .
maybe a painter .
maybe both ...
i'll write a book and draw the pictures .
then maybe people will understand me .
i don't know , change things .
donnie darko what the hell kind of name is that?
it's like a superhero or something .
what makes you think i'm not?
i should go .
for physics , montinoff is having me write this essay the greatest invention ever to benefit mankind .
it's monnitoff .
but that's easy .
antiseptics .
like , the whole sanitation thing .
joseph lister , 1895 .
before antiseptics , there was no sanitation , especially in medicine .
you mean soap?
well , i'm really glad school was flooded today .
why is that?
we'd never have had this conversation .
you're weird .
sorry .
no , that was a compliment .
well , look , uh ...
you want to go with me?
where do you want to go?
no , i mean , like , " go " with me .
you know , like " going together " .
sure .
0k .
where are you going?
i'm going home .
stupid ...
where are you going?
i'd like to try something new .
have you ever been hypnotised?
no .
when i clap twice , you will wake up .
do you understand?
yes .
so , tell me about your week .
i met a girl .
what is her name?
gretchen .
we're going together now .
do you still think about girls a lot?
yeah .
how are things going at school?
i think about girls a lot .
i asked you about school , donnie .
i think about fucking a lot during school .
what else do you think about during school?
" married with children " .
you think about your family?
i just turn down the volume and think about fucking christina applegate .
i asked you about your family .
no .
i don't think about fucking my family .
that's gross .
i'd like to hear about your friend frank .
sam bylan .
cherita chen .
donald darko .
daye dennis .
hey , you fuck !
did you say i flooded the school?
i didn't say shit .
yeah , well , they think i did it .
if you're innocent , then you have nothing to worry about , right?
fuck you !
you know what i think?
i think you did it .
beer and pussy that's all i need .
we gotta find ourselves a smurfette .
smurfette?
mm hm .
not some tight ass middlesex chick .
like , this cute little blonde that'll get down with the guys like smurfette does .
smurfette doesn't fuck .
that's bullshit .
why do you think papa smurf made her?
because the other smurfs were getting too horny .
not vanity .
i heard he was a homosexual .
then she fucks them while vanity watches .
what about papa smurf?
he must get some action?
what he does , he films the gang bang .
later on , he beats off to the tape .
first of all , papa smurf didn't create smurfette .
gargamel did .
she was sent as gargamel's evil spy to destroy the smurf village , but the overwhelming goodness of the smurfs transformed her .
and as for the whole gang bang scenario , it just couldn't happen !
smurfs are asexual .
they don't even have reproductive organs under those little pants .
that's what's so illogical about being a smurf .
what's the point of living if you don't have a dick?
donnie , why you gotta get smart on us?
grandma death .
excuse me !
excuse me !
please stay off the road , miss sparrow , or i will call social services .
i hate that miss farmer .
she's such a fucking bitch !
yeah .
how old is grandma death?
101 .
she does the same thing every day .
just walks back and forth and back and forth to the mailbox .
nothing ever in there .
0h , wait , wait , wait ...
she's going back to the box .
we may still have mail .
mail , mail , mail .
here it is .
this could be it .
0h ...?
0h , no dice , grandma .
sorry .
someone ought to write that bitch .
authorities continued their search for a suspect in the middlesex ridge school vandalism .
the private school has asked for donations to restore its beloved mascot , known only as the mongrel ...
it's very helpful .
there's a good turnout tonight .
what are you trying to accomplish here?
there was urine and faeces flooded in my office .
whatever fits .
whatever fits "?
in cooperation with the county police , we have begun an active investigation into the cause of the flooding .
and our suspects include several of our own students ...
i want to know why this filth is being taught to our children .
kitty , i would appreciate if you would wait ...
dr cole , not only am i a teacher , but i am also a parent of a middlesex child .
therefore i am the only person here who transcends the parent teacher bridge .
don't worry .
you got away with it .
i have in my hand graham greene's " the destructors " .
this short story is part of my daughter's english assignment .
in this story , several children destroy an elderly man's house from inside out .
how can you do that?
and how do they do this?
they flood the house by breaking through a water main .
l can do anything i want .
and so can you .
and i think that this garbage should be removed !
excuse me .
what is the real issue here?
the pta doesn't ban books .
the pta must acknowledge that pornography is being taught in our curriculum !
it's meant to be ironic .
excuse me .
go back to grad school .
why did you make me flood the school?
they are in great danger .
do you even know who graham greene is?
i think we have all seen " bonanza " .
well , um ... while we are on other topics ...
where do you come from?
do you believe in time travel?
who are you talking to?
i was just taking my pills , sam .
a storm is coming , frank says .
a storm that will swallow the children ,
and i will deliver them from the kingdom of pain .
i'll deliver them back to their doorsteps , send the monsters back to the underground .
i'll send them back to a place where no one else can see them .
except for me .
because i am donnie darko .
who is frank?
a six foot tall bunny rabbit .
ln these modern times , our attitude and beliefs are so delicate , so fragile .
l have had a cunning vision .
this vision has released me .
lt's important that our lifeline be rejuvenated , so that we can breathe again .
lt's time to breathe .
lt is time to breathe .
thank you , jim cunningham .
thank you , jim cunningham .
so now let us begin lifeline exercise number one .
please press stop now .
as you can see , the lifeline is divided into two polar extremes .
fear and love .
fear is in the negative energy spectrum .
love is in the positive energy spectrum .
no , duh
excuse me?
no , duh " is a product of fear .
now , on each card is a character dilemma which applies to the lifeline .
please ...
take this .
thank you .
please read each character dilemma aloud and place an " x " on the lifeline in the appropriate place .
cherita?
juanita has an important math test today .
she's known about the test for several weeks , but has not studied .
in order to keep from failing , juanita decides to cheat on the math test .
good .
good .
very good .
mr darko .
ling ling finds a wallet filled with money .
she takes it to the address on the driver's licence but keeps the money .
i'm sorry , miss farmer .
i don't get this .
just place an " x " in the appropriate place .
i know what to do , but you can't lump things into two categories .
the lifeline is divided that way .
well , life isn't that simple .
i mean ...
who cares if ling ling keeps the money?
it has nothing to do with fear or love .
they are the deepest human emotions .
0k .
but you're not listening to me .
there are other things to take into account , the whole spectrum of human emotion .
you can't just lump everything into two categories and deny everything else !
if you don't complete the assignment , you'll get a zero .
donald , let me preface this by saying that your iowa test scores are ... intimidating .
so ...
let's go over this again .
what exactly did you say to miss farmer?
i'll tell you .
he asked me to forcibly insert the lifeline exercise card into my anus !
nobody cares about responsibility , morality , family values ...
kitty ...
excuse us , please .
they've suspended him from after school activities for six months .
since this jet engine fiasco , i don't know what's gotten into ...
i'll say this because our daughters are on the dance team together and i respect you , but after witnessing your son's behaviour , i have significant doubts about your ...
0ur paths through life must be righteous .
go home and look in the mirror and pray that your son doesn't succumb to the path of fear .
do you remember that weird gym teacher , mrs farmer?
yeah .
0k , well , my brother told her to shove a book up her ass today .
and then my parents just bought him all this new shit .
yeah , i know .
i wish a jet engine would fall on my room .
dr monnitoff .
donnie .
um ...
i know this is gonna sound kind of weird , but do you know anything about ... time travel?
a wormhole with an einstein rosen bridge , which is theoretically a wormhole in space controlled by man .
so , according to hawking , a wormhole may be able to provide a short cut for jumping between two distant regions of space time .
so to travel back in time , you have to have a spaceship faster than the speed of light .
theoretically .
and be able to find a wormhole .
the basic principles of time travel are there .
your vessel and portal .
your vessel can be anything .
like a delorean?
metal craft of any kind .
you know , i love that movie .
it's so ... like , futuristic , you know?
listen , um ... don't tell anybody that i gave you this .
woman who wrote this used to teach here .
she was a nun long before that .
then overnight she became this entirely different person .
she up and left the church , wrote this book ...
she started teaching science , right here at middlesex .
the philosophy 0f time travel " .
roberta sparrow?
that's right .
roberta sparrow?
roberta sparrow .
grandma death .
it's called " the philosophy 0f time travel " .
what does philosophy have to do with it?
guess who wrote it .
who?
roberta sparrow .
huh !
she wrote a book .
grandma death wrote a book .
that's a terrible nickname .
we almost ran her down the other day .
she lives in that piece of crap house , and you know she's loaded .
you're right .
she was known for her gem collection .
kids used to go up there all the time and try to steal stuff from her .
she became a total recluse .
huh !
i didn't know she was alive till we damn near knocked her down .
she was just standing in the road , frozen .
l walked over to see if she was ok .
and she whispered in my ear .
what did she say?
i think frank wants me to talk to her .
he asked if i knew about time travel .
she wrote a book about it , so that can't be a coincidence , right?
what did she say to you?
she said that every living creature on earth dies alone .
how did that make you feel?
it reminded me of my dog callie .
she died when i was eight and she crawled underneath the ... the porch .
to die .
to be alone .
do you feel alone right now?
i don't know ...
i'd like to believe i'm not , but i just ...
i've just never seen any proof , so i just don't debate it any more .
i could spend my whole life debating it over and over and still wouldn't have proof , so i just don't debate it any more .
it's absurd .
the search for god is absurd?
it is if everyone dies alone .
does that scare you?
i don't want to be alone .
and his tapes have made me realise that for the last 39 years , i have been a prisoner of my own fear .
fear .
you have got to meet this jim cunningham .
i can't believe he's single .
it has been a disappointing night for these super bowl champions .
you're right , dan .
coach joe gibbs is on the sidelines .
he's gotta be thinking , " what happened?
what went wrong tonight?
and here's the kick .
0h !
lt's no good ...
shit , we need a quarterback .
we need a miracle .
we need to go for a safety .
what the future holds for this mvp , we'll have to wait and see .
you guys want anything?
this week on " who's the boss?
samantha borrows tony's van and gets caught without a licence .
better make sure we don't miss that one .
here we are again .
fourth down now ...
tomorrow , we meet our partners for the young inventors 'fair .
what if you could go back in time and take those hours of pain and replace them with something better?
like images?
yeah , a hawaiian sunset or the grand canyon .
things that remind you how beautiful ...
we've been going together for two weeks .
yeah?
well , i er ...
i ...
you want to kiss me?
i'm sorry , i ...
look , donnie , wait .
i just ...
well , i like you a lot .
i just want it to be at a time when ... it ...
when what?
when it reminds me just ...
when it reminds you how beautiful the world can be?
yeah .
and there's some fat guy staring at us .
i don't think telling any woman to forcibly insert an object up her anus is something that should go without consequence .
i think we should buy him a moped .
i think we should get a divorce .
you won't tell mom , will you?
why would i?
you tell mom everything .
no , i don't .
let me see it .
no , it's not finished .
it's ... 0k .
it's cool .
that's scary .
you think?
thank you for seeing us at such late notice .
we both felt we should come and discuss ...
what i think is going on with your son .
yes .
um ...
well , he's er ...
you know about his past , and he was suspended from school for insulting his gym teacher .
i'm not sure that's a good example .
i think he had just cause .
rose , let me lay out what i believe is happening here .
donnie's aggressive behaviour ... his increased detachment from reality , seem to stem from his inability to cope with the forces in the world that he perceives to be threatening .
has he ever told you about frank?
frank?
yes , the giant bunny rabbit .
the what?
i don't recall him ever having mentioned a rabbit .
donnie is experiencing what is commonly called a daylight hallucination .
this is a common occurrence among paranoid schizophrenics .
what can we do?
i would like to do more hypnotherapy ... .. and increase his medication .
whatever will help him , really , is ...
that's why we're here .
we just would like him to experience some relief .
so if you think that more medication will do that , then i think we should give it a try .
it's complicated .
yeah?
there's like a force in your brain that just sends you someplace .
do you go someplace familiar?
no , but each time i keep waking up farther from my house .
scary .
donnie darko .
i know .
good morning , you mongrels !
good morning .
is that all you can muster?
good morning !
good morning !
now , that's a tiny , tiny bit better .
but i still sense some students who are actually afraid to say " good morning " .
good morning !
yeah , that's what i like to hear !
too many young men and women today are completely paralysed by their fears .
they surrender their bodies to the temptation and destruction of drugs , alcohol and premarital sex .
now , i'm going to tell you a little story today .
it's a heartbreakingly sad story about a young man whose life was completely destroyed by these instruments of fear ,
