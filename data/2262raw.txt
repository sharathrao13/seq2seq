in tribute to jean cocteau
charlotte and her bloke
it's me
i know it's you .
i knew you'd come back .
i said you would .
you can't stay away from me .
you're an idiot .
you never listen
i know why you're back .
you've come to say you're sorry .
it's too late .
whatever it is , youd better not say it .
it's incredible
sure , you're the prettiest girl in paris .
so what , big deal !
with a guy like that you could see it coming .
idiot !
honestly , you exaggerate
i know what you're going to say , but it's rot , complete rot
so , it didn't work out
it didn't work out because it couldn't work out
it couldn't work out because it shouldn't have .
impossible .
possible ...
you should know that " impossible " is a french word
i too could throw myself at just anyone .
easy
i'm not blaming you for being in love but for thinking he was too
you can believe in love , but not in theories about it
girls are incredible .
honestly
they say love's like a waltz .
three little twirls , yes , yes , yes !
well , no !
that's why i said nothing
i knew you'd be back in a week , your tail between your legs
so what the hell are you doing here?
look at you now
you'll tell me you couldn't have known .
but you could , idiot
a creep like that !
i knew he'd drop you
i could see it coming .
you're such a fool
it's amazing how girls have no common sense
i don't deny you've a very nice little body
but you're still a nasty little bitch
i know you think he'll use you in his next film because you sleep with him
no chance .
i know him .
he's scum
listen to me !
if you at least made love properly , put your knee here , hand there , pushed a bit
i wouldn't have believed it if i hadnt witnessed it .
it can get on your nerves
i told you , he's not the type to take it lightly
he doesn't give a damn about girls
what're you thinking about?
what do you do together?
nothing .
he messes me about
let me finish .
i warned you not to make a fool of me
the same old story .
shit !
i don't blame you for running off with a guy you've known for three minutes ... ... when you've loved me for three years
but doing it so flippantly .
worse , with obvious flippancy .
there's a difference
don't play the fool
don't deny it .
i told you it couldn't work .
i knew you'd be back
seriously , you can't do without me
i told you a thousand times you never will
i know you're thinking i can't live without you either .
i agree
that's exactly why i knew you'd be back
don't deny it
because i love you , charlotte , you're forced to love me .
if i didn't love you , ok .
but since i do , you must love me too .
it's obvious
don't say no .
you're tiresome .
it's too much
it was a barmy thing to do , my girl
you don't have to be a genius , but you could use your brain now and again
that's right , you little fool
you're set on being in films?
you'll have to sleep with thousands more guys
anyway , why films?
it's cheap ...
cheap and corny
what is a film anyway?
a big head pulling faces in a little hall
you must be crazy to go for that !
i know what i'm talking about .
the cinema is an illusory art
novels , painting , ok !
but not the cinema .
everyone will tell you you're crazy
but you never listen .
so : you're the only girl in paris anyone can have ... ... for free !
i know what you're going to say ... that you love it
rather go on the streets .
at least you'd make some money
it's true !
but when i suggested it you refused .
all right !
but playing a streetwalker inside is a thousand times worse
i can screw around .
but not you !
because you compromise your soul .
yes !
there's a soul behind the face
and you see a girl's soul in her face
it's not the same for boys .
that shocks you?
it reminds me of a nut case , full of hot air
know what he said?
what is most important , ladies and gentlemen , is not love , not war ...
... not money , nor happiness , nor women
no , what is most important is the subtle difference !
yes , kitten .
but that'll be the day when you grasp that
christ ...
you've cut your hair .
but you're crazy !
just look at you !
france is full of idiots but you break all the records
i know what you'll say but you're wrong
unbelievable .
girls don't even realise it , but it's obvious
you're idiots by definition .
keep still !
let me finish
i know exactly what you're going to say : why do i love you?
well , you're a idiot !
who says i love you?
i don't any more , so there !
you should have seen it coming .
you've come back for nothing , dimwit
i told you if you ditched me you'd come back a week later saying you're sorry
i said i wouldn't give a damn
you'll plead with me in vain .
i'll pretend not to hear
like that actor , when simone simon told him she'd throw herself out of the window
i don't remember ...
it's in that max ophuls film
shut up !
it's all your fault
the morning we were getting married .
if you hadn't overslept ...
we wouldn't have been too late for the town hall
always the same .
girls think everything they do is permissible
damn !
it's unforgivable
i warned you .
you'll fall flat on your face
i knew you'd come snivelling back
you're too much .
it'll be a miracle if i forgive you .
there are limits
yes , damn it !
but miracles are very important .
everything that happens is miraculous
know what picasso said to jean cocteau?
it's a miracle ...
... not to drown in the bath !
don't answer me !
you'll be wrong
your great fault is babbling on forever .
guys hate it
you should know that by now
don't pretend not to listen
i know you're listening
i know that creep's waiting for you down there in his car
so get out !
i know your tricks , remember !
when we met , me in my parachutist's beret , you were bleating ...
my parents have thrown me out .
i've nowhere to sleep . " and idiot that i was ...
sleep in my bed .
i'll sleep in an armchair . " disgusting !
won't you put the coat over my feet?
you couldn't find a bigger idiot !
and me stroking you while you pretended to snooze
in the morning you put on the sweet innocent act
what must you think of me?
christ !
what do i think of you?
just look at yourself
joking apart , when i said you had pretty breasts it was to please you
im allowed to joke now and then , right?
incredible !
you're not the first i've foretold the worst for , and god knows i'm always right
look at your pal , vronique .
girls like that ...
you keep thinking men love you for your minds ...
they love your bums !
you like men who despise you .
for example , dancing ...
the first time we met ...
dancing the samba , the mambo .
but the poor jerks who go , in their ties ... ... multicoloured ...
what do they want?
rhythm , sambas , mambos?
forget it !
they come ... ... to rub up against it !
oh , it's a waste of time .
why don't you clear off?
i've had it up to here ... ... having my electric razor used for what?
for shaving your legs !
at last i'll have some peace !
at last i'll have my room back
i'll stand at the window without getting your undies in my face
i've been against guys who live off women ...
how wrong !
women should be kicked about !
i never wanted to , because i believed in being civilised
i was stupid !
you must beat them
that's it .
they need beating up !
it's sad to say , but you must
you can tell them whatever you like
not at all .
i'm talking sense , one sentence following the next
you must stay with me .
it's cartesian logic .
you love me , i love you
i'm deliberately speaking like an actor .
i'm deeply moved
you know i can't do without you .
slut !
if i'd known !
and that money with the caretaker .
don't pretend you've forgotten
if you go i'm finished
find another guy who'll put up with the lot without complaining
the evening you didn't come back , at the commissariat , they laughed and winked
too bad .
i don't give a damn .
im not angry with you
yes , i am angry .
no , im not
no , yes , i am ...
i don't know .
it's funny
i'm angry with you without being angry
i know i'm pathetic but it's because i love you
i can't live without you .
what shall i do if you leave me?
i'm begging you not to leave me .
besides , if you do .
i'll smash your face in
i've got contacts too .
i've had a telegram from hollywood , for my novel
stay with me .
as soon as my book's out , i'll buy you an alfa romeo
english cars are crummy .
i've always said you lacked taste
you're right , i'm rambling .
but it's your fault i'm all mixed up
i've been miserable since you left
don't leave me alone , i beg you .
stay !
you can't .
i'll kill myself .
i don't want to kill myself
i beg you , charlotte , stay !
i know what you'll say : men in love are cowardly , lazy , cruel , stupid
yes , it's true .
i'm a swine
but deep down you don't dislike it
you need someone like me ... a guy with style .
don't deny it , i know
you can't do without me either
that's why you're back , is that right?
no , jules , i came back for my toothbrush
