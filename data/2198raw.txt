oh , absotutelutely .
he did get our letter .
that's right .
not like the christmas he almost didn't .
oh , my .
i almost forgot that story .
and i thought santa was gonna forget us !
what happened?
well , it all started one windy winter's night .
it was just a few days before christmas , and , naturally , we were all quite festive .
oh , you should've seen the wonderful snowfall .
it came down ...
mmm , needs more salt .
hoo hoo hoo hoo !
hey , guys !
wait for tigger !
dear santa .
well , guys , you've been awfully good this year .
what kind of presents would you like to ask for?
i'd like a new fly swatter to keep the bugs off my carrots .
a fly swatter for ...
christopher robin , could santa also bring rabbit a small smackerel of honey?
just in case certain ... guests drop in?
eeyore?
could use an umbrella to keep the snow off my house .
not that it matters if i don't get one .
and a jar of honey for eeyore , too .
you think " sandy " claus will bring me a snowshoe for my tail?
i take a size 4 , triple " e " .
now , why would you want that?
allow me to demonster ate .
oh , yes .
i i see what you mean .
mm hmm .
what about you , piglet?
oh , d d d dear .
i i really haven't been able to decide .
um , w w whatever santa wants to bring is fine with me .
perhaps piglet would also like a few pots of uh , um ...
of honey?
however did you guess?
wait !
christopher robin !
we almost forgot !
what do you want for christmas?
all i want is a sled ... one big enough for me and maybe ... a friend or two?
that's it , then .
next stop ... the north pole !
... hooray ! ... it's on its way !
there it goes !
oh , d d d dear !
i do hope i'm not too late .
hello , piglet .
how do you like my christmas tree?
oh , it's very nice , pooh , but ...
i know .
it seems as if i have forgotten , oh , something .
yes , pooh , you did .
of course !
it needs a present beneath it !
oh , but that's what i came to tell you , pooh .
when we wrote our letter to santa , you didn't ask for a present .
oh , bother .
what ever will we do , pooh?
we shall swoop from the sky and snatch the letter before santa gets it !
are we ready to swoop yet , piglet?
almost , pooh .
are you sure this balloon can carry both of us?
oh , thank you , pooh oooooooooo !!
yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahh !

just right for not much of a house .
hoo hoo hoo hoo !
hiya , eeyore !
awwwwwww !

hope santa brings it .
well , of course he will .
we wrote him a letter from the heart .
right now , he's probably readin 'it , and his beady little eyes is wellin 'up with tears .
why , i betcha he's drownin 'in sorrows !

eeyore wants an umbrella for his house , but what he really needs is a ... a new house !
hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo !
no , two houses !
oh , split the difference ... make it a whole " condominimum " !
well , thanks .
and four snowshoes for tigger , so he can bounce six times higher !

thanks , rabbit !
and 10 pots o 'honey for pooh !
11 .
it's the season of giving !
hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo !

just think , piglet ... all we need to do is give christopher robin this sled and all the christmas presents will be ... present .

always thought he'd be taller .
but of course i'm santa claus .
i have the hat , don't i?
he does , ya know .
and the boots?
i even have the sled .
so i suppose i must be santa claus .
hmm , got a point there .

pooh bear , which way was the wind blowing when you tried to send our letter?
why , to the " s , " toward santa?
s " is for south !
santa lives at the north pole !
oh .
oh , d d d dear .
perhaps we have too little wind for so much letter .
whatta ya know?
fresh outta breeze .
how will it get to the north pole?
someone must take it there himself .
um , uh , which one of us himselves did you have in mind?
me .
you?
but the north pole is so very far !
what if you can't get back in time for christmas?
it will be worth having no christmas , piglet , if i can bring christmas to all of you .
oh , pooh .
what a pal !
what a friend !
what a bear and a half !
say , uh , while you're there , could you put in a good word with the big guy in red for me?
goodbye , pooh .
goodbye , everyone .
and ... merry christmas .

i'm supposed to take you to santa !
oh , boy , this christmas is gonna go down in history !
yes , as the first one we've spent without pooh .
but think of all the neat stuff we're gettin '!
oh , come on , piglet , ol 'pal .
look at us ... we're happy .
where's your christmas spirit?
what's christmas if your best friend isn't here to share it?
i don't even know what present i wanted , but i'd give it up to have pooh bear here .
you know , so would i.

oh , my !
i don't know what it is , but i think it's wonderful .
aren't you going to open your present , pooh?
but i forgot to ask for what i wanted , and then i went to get the letter back , and then i never did get it to the north pole , and then i ... well ...
christopher robin , i don't deserve this .
i don't deserve anything .
but , pooh , santa brought it for you !
which was awfully nice , but , you know ,
i think being with your friends is ... nicer .

how could i ever forget something as important as you ...
your christmas present !
oh , um ...
wait right here , piglet .
well , a alright , pooh , but ... but ... but it's really ...
pooh looked and looked for piglet's present .
he looked , and he looked , and he looked again .
and when he wasn't looking , he * searched * instead .
but , alas for poor pooh , everywhere he looked and searched was still somewhere where it wasn't .
pooh looked from christmas day all the way to new year's eve , until he quite forgot what he was searching for in the first place .
what?
pooh bear !
hmm , christopher?
poo ooh?
christopherrrr? !
pooh bear !
christopher ro o o biiin !
christopher?
oh , my goodness . ... happy new year ! ... it is?

a party?
oh !
and we'll make our new year's resolutions .
resol oceans?
oof !
bother .
resolutions , pooh .
it's when you promise to do something you've never done or not do something you used to do .
it's a promise to be a better person in the new year .
hmm ... res o lutions !
and something sweet?
that does sound like a party to me .
so where , may i ask , is this party to be?
why , anywhere our friends are together , pooh .
well , in that case , i know just the place ...
rabbit's house .
he certainly is a friend , not to mention , he always has a smackerel or three , and he never minds sharing one with me .
it would only be proper to ask first , pooh .
yes , alright , christopher .
i shall stop by rabbit's house before i go and invite all the others to rabbit's house .
happy new year , pooh .
see you at the party !
happy new year , pooh , happy pooh year , new
hope it's sweet and sunny like a pot of honey
for a pooh year treat , friends will meet and greet
in the new year , pooh year , too !
deedledum
ooh dee la doo doo ho ho ho ho
there .
ha ha !
now , that's a happy little carrot plant .
my , my , rabbit .
i didn't know you could grow carrots indoors .
well , it's ... it's something only rabbits know .
you see , every year , i bring in the last carrot of the summer ...
there , there ...
i feed it , water it , and read to it all winter long , as recommended , of course , in this official carrot growing instruction manual .
then , in the spring ,
i use it to start my garden all over again .
ha ha ha !
hello , little fella .
yes , that's it .
keep talking to it , piglet , while i get the plant food .
carrot plants love to be talked to .
oh , d d dear .
w w what do you suppose that might be?
oh , d d dear !
what ever shall we do? !
hello !
hello !
uh , h hello?
my tummy's always asking for honey .
but this is the first time that the honey has answered .
oh !
my carrot !
pooh , what are you doing in there?
mmm .
your honey invited me in .
naturally , i didn't want to appear unfriendly , rabbit .
neither did my tummy .
your tummy? !
is that all you ever think about?
well? !
mmm .
i'm trying to remember .
where's my carrot?
and where's piglet?
a a a a choo ! ... bless you . ... bless you .
uh , thank you .
uh , piglet?
what are you doing under there?
we both got v very scared , a and i wasn't sure what to do .
so i i thought this might be a good place for , uh , not being sure .
must you be afraid of everything , piglet?
w well , i i i suppose that depends ... o on how f f frightening it is !
now what?
who's there?
hoo hoo hoo hoo !
hiya , rabbit !
you want to hear the good news?
hoo hoo hoo !
snow does not keep tiggers from bouncin ', not one bitty bit .
hoo hoo hoo hoo !
agh !
get off me , tigger !
eeyore .
thanks for noticin '.
what are you doing under there , besides being sad and gloomy?
not much ... as usual .
hey , long ears !
want to see what else tiggers can do?
they can throw a snowball and catch it themselves !
hoo hoo !
first , the windup ... then ... the toss !
and now the most tigger ific part ... the catch !
hoo hoo !
oopsy .
my carrot !
oh ho ho !
oh !
oh , thank goodness you're okay .
tigger , there is such a thing as being excessively bouncy , you know .
oh , why , thanks , long ears .
that means a lot to me .
oh !
happy new year , tigger !
welcome to the party . ... party? ... party? !
well , thanks for invitin 'me .
here , let me help .
hoo hoo !
partying's what tiggers like best .
what party?
why , the one we're having at your house , of course .
um , i did mention that , right , rabbit?
what? !
is that a " no , " rabbit?
come on , long ears .
i'll help you decorate . ... uh oh ! ... not that !
piglet !
watch out !
whooooaaaa !
tigggerrrr !
oh !
oh , bother .
piglet !
save the carrot !
it figures . ... oh ! ... whoa !
party always starts without me .
don't be ridiculous !
why , this party just got rollin '!
hoo hoo hoo hoo !
that's it .
that does it .
out !
out !
everybody , out !
out !
i've had it !
my carrot will never make it through the new year with all of you around ... and neither will i !
we are both ... leaving !
... leaving? ... leaving? ... leaving?
you mean g g going away?
where ever will you go?
oh ho !
someplace where there are no honey munching pooh bears , no petrified piglets , no gloomy donkeys , and no always bouncing tiggers !
sheesh !
the brain boggles .
what kind of place would that be?
paradise !
rabbit ... gone?
what will we do without him?
well , we could have the party at your house , i suppose .
i know what you're thinking ... it's gonna be a little cramped , but , uh , since there is , um ... gonna be ... ... one less of us ...
oh , d d dear .
pooh , isn't there something we can do to make rabbit stay?
think , think , think .
perhaps since rabbit isn't happy with the way we are , he might be happier with some way we ... aren't?
uh , you mean if we were different?
no longer our warm , fuzzy selves?
no more bundles of joy?
oh , my !
we could all ... change .
we could all make a resolution .
a rusty tution? !
a resolution , tigger .
it's something christopher robin told me .
it's a promise that you make to yourself to change .
uh , c change?
well , if it means rabbit won't move away , then ... then i'm ready to change .
me too !
me three !
well , i doubt it'll help , but count me in .
i promise not to eat honey ... ever again .
who said that?
pooh bear !
you don't know what you're sayin '!
if you can do it , pooh , so can i.
i p p promise not to be afraid anymore .
oh !
piglet !
what has come over you? !
oh , well .
things can't get any worse than they are now .
i promise to be so cheerful you won't even know it's me .
neither will i.
stickin 'with their pals is what tiggers do best .
so ...
i hereby and hitherforth promise to ... never bounce ... another bounce .
you got my word .
this tigger's high hoppin 'days are history ! ... tigger ... ... that spring sproing in my step is gone ! ... tigger ... ... nevermore will i ever ...
tigger !
aggh !
what?
oh .
yeah .
well , this is gonna be tougher than i thought .
but don't worry ...
tiggers always stick to their rusty tutions !
stick?
as in sticky?
as in ... honey?
and so pooh's friends , trying to please rabbit , found themselves in a bit of a jam .
jam?
as in honey?
if pooh can't eat honey ,
piglet can't be afraid ,
tigger can't bounce , and eeyore can't be gloomy , then the question is ...
what do we do now?
ankles aweigh !
uhh !
umph !
oh , d d dear .
tigger , a are you alright?
oh , why , sure .
this is my tigger ific way of not bouncin '.
see?
i ... uhh !
umph !
oh .
oh , that's good .
i i i was afraid you were hurt .
oh , i did it again ... said i was afraid .
uh , tigger , you're never afraid , are you?
i guess i was too busy bouncin 'to ever think about it .
so that means if i bounce , i won't be afraid?
why , it works for me .
hoo hoo hoo hoo !
well , at least it used to ... back in my bouncin 'days .
ha ha ha !
ha ha ha !
ha ha ha !
ha ha ha !
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha !
look , tigger !
i'm bouncing !
i'm bouncing !
ha ha ha ha !
now i won't be afraid of anything !
ha ha ha !
thank you , tigger !
thank you !
oh , how about that?
i guess bouncin 'does keep you from being afraid .
look at the little guy .
he's ... well ...
but that would mean that not bouncin 'might make a fella ... sorta ... squeamish?
even ... a tad t trembly?
just around the edges , uh ...
not to mention t t t teeterin '... on the brink of terror? !
oh , d dear !
double " oh , d dear !
what's that?
aghh !
it's got me !
aghh !
ha ha !
whew !
i'm not eating honey
not even thinking of thinking of thinking of eating honey
i'm not
i'm simply making sure that , um , the honey is , uh , safe .
why , hello , pooh bear .
what ever are you looking for?
well , i i certainly wasn't looking for , um ...
oh . ... honey .
well , that's fortunate , because i just discovered the last little honey pot , much to my delight .
i couldn't be happier for you ... even if i could be happier for you .
no honey .
no hope of any honey .
not even any hope of any hope of any honey .
pooh bear ...
i have this funny feelin '.
what ever could it be?
i'm sure i wouldn't know .
think , think , think .
why , i believe it's the honey that gives me this funny feeling and stops the rumbly in my tumbly as well .
i'm glad .
at least i think i'm glad .
i'm not sure how glad feels , but if i ...
why , that's it , pooh !
i think i'm glad !
seeeee? !
honey
no , not for me
a honey humming honeybee
would not even want to see
or be with me
with ... honey
oh , " restful acres ... quiet , secluded , and peaceful living .
oh , you see , little fellow?
it'll be wonderful .
and i'm sure we'll make lots of new ... quieter friends .

mmm .
oh . ... simply wonderful .
oh , bother .
i just broke my resolution .
oops .
i bounced mine into itty bitty pieces , too .
oh , d d dear , i was so afraid for rabbit .
i didn't keep my promise either .
well , it's unanimous .
i was so upset , i forgot to be happy .
i suppose that means ...
goodbye , rabbit .
w wait a minute .
w what are you talking about?
well , our new year's resolutions , of course .
we tried to change for you .
hello !
happy new year !
is everybody ready for the party?
we're ready , alright ... for the world's worst new year's party .
what ever do you mean?
it will be a new year ... but without our old friend .
our d dear friend .
our former friend .
that paragon of bunny dom ...
rabbit .
rabbit's leaving?
i know !
uh , leaving?
me?
now , why would i want to leave friends who are so loyal they would change just to please me?
but we didn't change .
we tried , rabbit , but ... we just stayed our same old selves .
and thank goodness for that .
why , what kind of a pooh bear would you be if you , uh , didn't like honey?
a very hungry one .
and a tigger who doesn't bounce really isn't a tigger at all .
you're not just sayin 'that to mend our broken hearts , are ya?
well , are ya? !
oh , and , eeyore ...
this pooh shirt was too itchy , even for me .
and little piglet ...
oh , rabbit , i was afraid i'd never get to be scared again .
there , there .
you can hide under my bed whenever you want .
that rabbit , he just gives and gives .
please don't change .
i like all of you just the way you are .
i'm the one who needs to change .
but , rabbit ... if you weren't you , then we'd all be a bit less , um ... we .
exactly , pooh .
that's what friends do for each other .
they help you to be more of who you are .
now , come on , everyone .
it's time to celebrate the new year !
oh , at my house , of course !
5 ... 4 ... 3 ... 2 ... 1 ...
happy new year !
quiet , everyone .
uh , christopher robin has something to say .
i'd like to make a toast .
i love toast !
oh , have you tried it with honey?
delicious .
here's to the happiest of new years to all my wonderful friends .
let's all raise a cup to ring in the new year .
happy new year .
i , uh , believe these are yours , tigger .
i'm very sorry if i ...
oh , that's okay , ra ra .
let's just let bygones be gone .
the important thing is that we're pals forever .
am i right?
abs o tutely , ol 'friend .
you see?
nothing brings friends together like bells .
how true , how true .
and i think that calls for ...
one more round of , uh , " jingly bells "?
oh , look at you !
a heh heh heh !
jingly bells
jingly bells
on a new year's eve
and i'm so glad to be right here
that i may never leave

to old friends , every one
we give to you our gratitude
for good times , joy , and fun !

and days of auld lang syne?
for auld lang syne , my dear

in the hundred acre wood
we gather round with friends
and pass the cup of honey 'round
until the old year ends
mmm .

for auld lang syne , my friends
for auld lang syne
we'll pass the cup of honey 'round
for auld lang syne
