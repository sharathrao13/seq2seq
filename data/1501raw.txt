did i hear home? .
or was i wrong , then? .
no , you're right .
i'm matoban .
and a fair matoban , in fact .
king , you stay with that bus .
do you know who i am? .
yes .
you're a killer .
you ordered the murder of ajene xola .
you got a red light in that car? .
why don't you use it? .
who told you this nonsense? .
where's my brother? .
your brother? .
i don't even know who you are .
you are on the wrong bus , so to speak , to be so reckless .
your people arranged a meeting through philippe broullet .
you know him .
i don't ... and i didn't .
but the fact is , somebody wants you to believe that i killed ajene xola .
i don't believe you .
but you should believe me .
why? .
because i would form a coalition with xola .
neither of us have made enough progress alone .
he has the working people .
i have the finances .
if he is dead , it is a loss for all of us .
me especially .
we're getting off .
i got the back room .
jesus .
clear the other room .
ok .
closet .
yeah .
i got the bed .
ho !
keller? .
we got a dead body in the closet .
jamal? .
yeah .
i'll call it in .
god , how can you see in here? .
wait .
wait .
why the lanterns? .
well , that's just rude .
what do you do so far away from home? .
i work .
and i hope .
same as me , then .
i doubt it .
you work for ...? .
i'm an interpreter at the un .
so like the un .
layers of languages signifying nothing .
you'd prefer more war? .
i prefer more business .
guys , get with me here .
we got a situation .
no , boss , we got a situation .
we just got on the 1 33 .
with mohammad .
and silvia broome .
and kuman kuman .
what? .
you're on the same bus? .
with our subjects .
get off the bus , and get silvia broome off that bus now .
we can't do that .
we're moving .
doug , is the room mate carrying anything? .
doug , is he carrying anything? .
a satchel .
all right ... where is it? .
it's in his lap .
he's been carrying it all day .
oh , man .
can either of you get to him? .
not without gettin 'made .
despite all the flags on first avenue , there are no nations any more .
only companies .
international companies .
it's where we are .
it's what we are .
i think you're wrong .
you are still young .
i'm an acquired taste .
what's your brother's name? .
simon .
simon broome .
ok , we're stopping .
you got guts , coming out here .
i'll see what my people can find out about him .
but remember , i'm not your brother's keeper , eh? .
yeah .
thank you .
come on , guys , talk to me .
what's going on? .
we're stopped .
she's getting off .
what's going on? .
and so is my subject .
keep talking to me .
what's going on? .
is he carrying the satchel? .
ok , he's got the satchel .
but i think he made me .
that's ok , i got him .
kuman? .
he's staying put .
miss broome !
please get in the car .
move it !
i got gamba .
i'll stay with kuman .
no .
just get off that bus .
get everybody off that bus right now !
doug !
mohammad? .
hey !
guy forgot his lunch .
oh , man .
i'm standing here on nostrand avenue in crown heights , at a scene that can only be described as unconscionable carnage . .. frantically helping victims of an apparent terrorist attack .
these events are more familiar in the cities of the middle east .
there is no word yet .
however , there are unconfirmed reports that kuman kuman , the exiled matoban revolutionary , may have been on board .
you all right? .
i'm ok .
doug? .
this is ron ferguson , reporting live on nostrand avenue in brooklyn , where just after 1 0 . 30 am this morning ...
we're ok , boss .
.. the violence has now found its way into the heart of new york city ...
the death toll is 1 7 , with scores injured ...
the obvious speculation about al qaeda ... .. widely seen as the probable successor to edmond zuwanie ...
tunnels and bridges will close for at least 1 2 hours ... .. alleged terrorist attack by ajene xola ... ..
zuwanie is still planning to address the general assembly of the un .
what were you doing on that bus? .
thank you for bringing me home .
hey !
i lost a man today .
a kid .
how do you know kuman? .
i never met him before .
you think that not getting caught in a lie is the same as the truth !
i'm not lying .
i went to him for help .
with what? .
i can't tell you .
someone might get hurt .
someone might get hurt .
there's a bus full of dead people !
someone might get hurt "? .
who? .
someone you know? .
someone who's mixed up in all this? .
you? .
why did you leave africa? .
i told you .
no , you didn't .
why did you come here? .
stop it .
goddammit !
stop shouting at me !
stop lying !
i'm not lying !
stop lying !
i was just on that bus !
i can't think with all this noise .
i can't !
you have to stop !
that isn't me .
don't be ridiculous .
it isn't me .
no , that is you .
and i know , because i drive you home , and i look at you through the binoculars , and everything else that i shouldn't do .
it was once .
it's not any more .
after the rallies , after my parents and sister were killed , then the rifles came out .
it was the only way to get anyone to listen .
just to listen .
i killed a boy who had nothing to live for beyond the money he'd get for killing me .
i shot him in the head so he wouldn't shoot me .
then i handed the rifle to my brother and told him , " i'm through .
i walked away with him shouting at me , " you're a coward .
our parents are dead , zuwanie's alive .
my brother , who in another life wouldn't harm a ...
that was the last thing he ever said to me .
the only contact i have is the notebooks i send and imagine him receiving .
i know he's alive .
i know it .
but i'm not to him .
i lied to you because i was afraid .
i was afraid he might be involved in what i heard .
i lied to everyone else so they'd let me near the un , and that's the only place that i believe has a chance to change any of this .
and i lied to you about ajene xola because ...
i loved him .
once .
until the colour of my skin became a problem .
the politics of my skin .
i walked away from africa with nothing .
no brother , no family , no lover , nothing .
just a belief that words and compassion are the better way .
even if it's slower than a gun .
where are you going? .
you've got blood all over your face .
you can't say stuff like that with blood on your face .
this is precisely why dr zuwanie must be allowed to speak .
this monstrous act of terrorism was aimed at you ... .. and at the heart of the united nations .
i can't listen to this .
do not allow them to intimidate you ... .. or dr zuwanie .
i'm not at liberty to tell you .
where we going? .
bathroom .
keller .
get this processed and back to me right away .
did he leave a note? .
did you read it? .
of course you did .
would you read it to me , please? .
dear silvia , i came to tell you something and then didn't .
i wanted to , but when i saw you i couldn't find the words .
i told you i didn't know where simon is .
that was a lie .
he was there that day .
a young boy shot him .
i couldn't tell you .
i'm a coward .
simon was braver than me .
you're braver than me .
i'm so sorry .
i'm so sorry .
the second time was me .
i feel like my friends must feel when they try to say something .
it's all right .
that's what i say to them .
he left this with the note .
the only thing that i wanted ...
.. besides having her back ... was to be left alone .
my bonnie lies over the ocean
don't cry .
don't cry .
i'm not crying .
you don't have to cry .
i'm not .
because i'm here , and i won 't leave .
i promise .
look at me .
i'll take care of you .
we'll take care of each other .
i'll take care of you .
promise me .
i promise .
i promise .
xola's dead .
kuman's dead .
who do you work for? .
don't touch .
those things'll kill you .

that would be good for us .
but i doubt it .
he tried to kill her .
what happened? .
i shot him .
that's a pity .
he might have told us something .
and miss broome? .

he killed her? .
she was gone before he got there .

i gotta take you home .
what if there were two guys? .
three? .
we just set the trap and run? .
is that it? .
they're not our family and they're not our friends .
you told me that .
you lose somebody , you lose somebody .
i don't want to lose two somebodys .
one circle , then i'm taking you home .
hello? .
are you there? .
i'm fine .
i'm all right , but i ...
i can't talk to you .

it takes too long , tobin .
i'm going home .
keller .

she's booked 9 am , jfk .
i'm on the lle .

not as much sky as i remember , but more skyscrapers .
23 years , dr zuwanie .
things change .
they diminish .
desire diminishes .
where is the second avenue? .
just after we get off the bridge .
they decorated the bridge .
when i came here before , they lined the bridge with flowers , welcoming me .
that flight departs from gate one .
thank you .
no sign of her .
hasn't checked in yet .
let me know when it's boarding .
can we hold 'em in the safe room to buy time? .
you can try , but it's up to him .
there was a parade .
right here on this second avenue .
there was a snowstorm of confetti .
murderer !
this is second avenue , sir .
are you at the mission? .
yeah , but he isn't .
nobody knows where he is .
they know , they just won't tell us .
you get a photo ld? .
yeah .
go back inside and fax that to un security now .

i've got eight minutes .

49th ... 42nd .

thank you .
thank you .
levels , please .
the assembly will first hear an address by the president of the republic of matobo .
on behalf of the general assembly ,
i have the honour to welcome to the united nations
his excellency dr edmond zuwanie , president of the republic of matobo , and to invite him to address the assembly .
mr president , mr secretary general .
today my beloved country is under siege .
as you saw the other afternoon across the river in brooklyn , the terrorists in my country will stop at nothing .
how am i to defend my country against enemies like these? .
i admit i have dealt harshly with terrorists ...
tobin , it's king . .. as we all will have to .
i don't think matu's here .
remember the profile of suicide bombers and how there isn't one? . .. who know the evil and violence of real terrorism ...
your mother and sister will get their cheque on monday .
this isn't his apartment .
you did well .
no one here will live long .
it's an alds hospice . .. with a reciprocal and immediate violence ...
my opinion? .
it's a con .
i have been forced to do this .
it is the hope and specific goal of my administration
to reform these brutal methods ...
get him off the podium .
to participate in the formation ...
we've got to go .
but i want to speak !
come on , sir , run !
he's ok .
cover here .
i'll take the hall .
where's keller? .
freeze !
incredible .
thank god i looked up .
he's from our mission .
i know .
holster your weapon .
dr zuwanie .
i remember the last time you were here .
use the 42nd street exit .
we almost had an assassination here .
please move ...
we watched you on the telly back home .
my family .
all the families .
you were like the beatles .
two or three more seconds , he would have assassinated him .
an almost assassinated leader gets so much credibility so he can stay in power and gets to stick around to enjoy it .
we were so proud of you .
there you were , speaking to the world .
i don't think you should touch ...
because i'm not wearing a glove? .
what is your name , child? .
i'm the silvia whose family you killed .
what's in your hand? .
it's ...
just a precaution .
what's in your hand? .
he must've been very surprised .
he thought it was a live round .
where is everyone? .
but you knew better .
give me the live round .
i grew up seeing you with this gun .
it's the gun you saved our country with .
drop the gun !
put it down !
keller , us secret service .
it's the same one you used to kill it .
he's got a glock on his hip .
code 1 00 in the sound room .
look at it .
look at it !
careful .
the bleeder had alds .
there's no way you can prove this .
you'll cop a plea .
you're just an employee , right? .
he's in custody .
they're bringing him down .
swat team's at 42nd street .
are you all right? .
yeah .
where's zuwanie? .
the safe room .
what happened? .
it was a fake .
a piece of theatre to justify the killing .
ethnic cleansing , genocide .
you there? .
that's the flight .
she's not on it .
i checked every hotel in new york , her friends .
they don't know where she'd go .
no one knows her .
i know her .
ok , where is she? .
she said she was going home .
i'm going home ...
what home? .
how'd you happen to be there after hours? .
an evacuation .
i left some things .
it takes too long ...
i wouldn 't mind if he were gone .
she's here .
she's been in that room all night .
how could someone so good , so ...
how could you give us so much , so much ... then take away more? .
he in there? .
yeah .
keep everybody out .
silvia? .
silvia? .
it's me .
i'm coming in alone .
i'm coming in .
five minutes .
close it .
close it !
silvia , don't do this .
it was all just theatre , an almost assassination meant to justify his acts .
we've got all we need to prosecute .
i have him .
he'll die in prison .
i want him to die how simon died .
that'll be over in two seconds , and you'll have all your years .
sir , it's a lot worse than you think .
your so called assassin is dead .
your head of security is making a deal .
we have lud and the rifle .
you'll be tried before two courts .
he's been tried !
sir , you're finished .
it doesn't matter !
silvia .
listen to me .
i told you i'd let him drown .
the man who drove my wife into a bridge abutment .
but i wouldn't .
then you'd be wrong .
no , i wouldn't be wrong .
i don't want to spend the rest of my life in mourning .
you have to get out of here .
i can't do that .
so put the gun down .
i can't .
yes , you can .
put it down .
i can't !
i can't ...
i can't .
just go .
this is how it's done .
this is how you put a gun down .
please .
you shoot him , he'll be dead ... .. but then you'll be dead ... .. and i don't know what i'll be .
put it down .
read it !
read it .
where? .
the beginning .
read it .
" the gunfire around us ...
louder .
like when you wrote it .
when you believed it .
when you meant it .
the gunfire around us makes it hard to hear .
but the human voice is different from other sounds .
" it can be heard ...
" it can be heard over ... over noises that bury everything else . " " even ...
" even ...
" even when it's not shouting .
shouting . " " even when it ...
even if it's just a whisper .
even the lowest whisper can be heard over armies ...
" when ...
" when ...
.. " when it's telling the truth .

they didn't believe you .
they're sending me back .
i wanted to say goodbye .
it's ok .
