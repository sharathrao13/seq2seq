the papers that i gave you have a series of quotes ,,, from some antislavery writers of that time period ,
you read the first quote , rosie ,
it's from an antislavery writer by the name of david child ,,, written to the mexican government ,,, warning them about his own united states government ,
read it to the class , [ rosie ]
dear sirs , there is an impatient and almost ir
irresistible desire in the south and southwest ,,, to lay hold on texas " [ miss coleman ]

you find your niche , you stay there , you stay cool ... and you be the man into your 50's and 60's .
and then you retire your old ass to a nice condo someplace hot ... with a lot of nicejewish people .
leave the business for your kids .
