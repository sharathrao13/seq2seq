pukch'ong coast , north korea
look , what is this?
i'm supposed to
colonel tan sun moon's h. q. de militarised zone north korea
open the bag .
that will teach you to lecture me .
retract the blast doors .
find me a new anger therapist .
i am zao .
you are late .
mr. van bierk .
i've been looking forward to this meeting .
me too .
my african military friends owe you many thanks , colonel moon .
few men have the guts to trade confilct diamonds since the u. n. embargo .
i know all about the u. n. i studied at oxford and harvard .
majored in western hypocrisy .
from your modest collection of cars , i wouldn't have guessed .
show me the diamonds .
show me the weapons .
bring the weapons .
hiding weapons in the de militarised zone .
it's a bit of a minefield out there .
america's cultural contribution .
one mililon landmines .
and my hovercrafts float right over them .
rpgs , flamethrowers , automatic weapons ... ... and enough ammunition to run a small war .
my diamonds?
check it over quick .
don't blow it all at once .
i have special plans for this consignment .
his name is james bond , a british assassin .
mr. van bierk , let me show you something .
our new tank buster .
depleted uranium shells , naturally .
naturally .
and how do you propose to kill me now , mr. bond?
it's pathetic that you british still believe you have the right to police the world .
you will not llve to see the day all korea is ruled by the north .
then you and i have something in common .
who is it?
where's my son?
it's the general .
hello ... father .
why is there a fire?
i'll be there in five minutes .
get the weapons out of here . ... and kill the spy .
saved by the bell .
my son is dead .
14 months later
i don't condone what they do here .
i don't condone what they do here .
tell it to the concierge .
still you jest .
defiant to the last .
your people have abandoned you .
your very existence denied .
why stay silent?
it doesn't matter anymore .
things are out of my hands .
we reach the end , mr. bond .
spare me the unpleasantries .
spare me the unpleasantries .
fifty years after the superpowers carved korea in two ... ... and then you arrive .
a british spy , an assassin .
and now the hard ilners have their proof .
we cannot trust the west .
you ....
you took away my son .
your firing squad should have done the job for me .
i hoped a western education would help him become a bridge ... ... between our worlds .
but all it did was to corrupt him .
let's get this over with , shall we?
my son had an ally in the west .
for the last time , who was it?
who made him betray his country and name?
the same person who betrayed me .
turn around .
start walking .
start walking .
keep walking , please .
keep moving .
zao .
i'm being traded ... ... for you .
keep moving .
keep walking , please .
your time will come .
not as soon as yours .
keep walking , please .
look at him .
double check .
you'd think he was some kind of a hero .
reference nine .
sir .
section four .
okay , hold him tight .
got him .
watch his legs now .
all right , let's go .
no biological agents in the prelim scan .
he's clean .
pulse , 7 2 .
blood pressure , 1 20/ 80 .
lndications of neurotoxins , histamine , serotonin and enzyme inhibitors .
scorpion venom .
note also traces of a venom antiserum .
they'd sting him then administer the antidote .
yet his internal organs seem unaffected .
liver not too good .
it's definitely him then .
morning .
welcome back .
such hospitallty .
you don't seem too pleased to see me .
if i'd had my way , you'd still be in north korea .
your freedom came at too high a price .
zao .
he tried to blow up a summit between south korea and china .
took out three chinese agents before he was caught .
and now he's free .
i never asked to be traded .
i'd rather die than let him loose .
you had cyanide .
threw it away years ago .
what is this?
the top american agent ... ... in the north korean high command was executed a week ago .
the americans intercepted a signal from your prison naming him .
and they think it's me?
you were the only inmate .
they concluded you cracked and were hemorrhaging information .
we had to get you out .
and what do you think?
with the drugs they gave you , you wouldn't know what you said .
i know the rules .
and number one is , no deals .
get caught and you're given up .
the mission was compromised .
moon got a call exposing me .
he had a partner in the west .
even his father knew .
whether that's true or not , it's irrelevant .
no , it isn't .
the same person who set me up then set me up to get zao out .
so i'm going after him .
you're going to our evaluation center in the falklands .
double o status rescinded .
along with my freedom?
for as long as i deem necessary , yes .
you're no use to anyone now .
he's in cardiac arrest .
get the crash cart .
notify his superiors .
he's flat ilning on the ecg .
stand by .
two hundred joules .
three hundred .
get me some atropine .
we're losing him !
stand by .
clear .
i'm checking out .
thanks for the kiss of llfe .
security breach on level three .
all personnel , defensive code red .

security breach on level three .
all personnel , defensive code red .

security breach on level three .
all personnel , defensive code red .
my goodness , standards are falling .
no tie , dear me .
my usual suite , please .
do you have a credit card?
or even any luggage , sir?
mr. bond , so good to see you .
it's been a long time .
mr. chang .
open the presidential suite .
send up my tallor .
and some food .
the lobster's good , with qualls 'eggs and silced seaweed .
and if there's any left , a '61 bollinger .
of course .
do it ... quickly .
been busy , have we , mr. bond?
just surviving , mr. chang .
just surviving .
i am peacefui fountains of desire , the masseuse .
i come with compilments of the manager .
i'm sure you do .
come in .
on the bed , please .
face down .
yes , of course .
i'm not that kind of masseuse .
i'm not that kind of customer .
you think i haven't always known you're chinese intelligence , chang?
hong kong is our turf now .
don't worry about it .
i'm not here to take it back .
put your hands down .
what the hell do you want?
just to help you settle a score .
zao killed three of your men .
you get me into north korea , i'll take care of him for you .
what's in it for you?
chance to get even .
zao has information i need .
i'll have to ask beijing .
do it .
now get out .
unless you really wanna give me a massage .
mr. bond .
a llttle thank you from us .
cuba?
it seems mr. zao has iost himself in havana .
if you find him , say goodbye from us .
with pleasure .
havana
i'm here to pick up some delectados .
delectados?
we haven't made delectados in 30 years .
universai exports .
check with your boss .
raoul ....
universai exports .
follow me .
your passport , senor .
i'd come to think the delectados would never be smoked .
they are particularly hazardous for one's health , mr ...?
bond .
mr. bond .
do you know why?
it's the addition of the volado tobacco .
slow burning .
it never goes out .
just like a sleeper .
sorry for the rude awakening .
i love my country .
i'd never ask you to betray your people .
i'm after a north korean .
a tourist?
a terrorist .
one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter .
zao has no interest in other people's freedom .
i still have some friends in high places .
favors called in .
some dollars spread about .
we find your friend is here , on an island .
in los organos .
there is a strange cilnic run by dr. alvarez .
he ieads the field in gene therapy .
increasing the llfe expectancy of our beloved ieaders .
and , of course , the richest westerners .
we may have iost our freedom in the revolution ... ... but we have a health system second to none .
you didn't do too badly out of the revolution .
we all have our ways of getting by .
you'd be surprised how many government officials come to me ...
... for reminders of the decadent times .
yeah , well ....
mind if i borrow these?
please .
my sources tell me this zao is very dangerous .
i wish i could give you more help .
i could use a fast car .
mojito , por favor .
mr. krug , your admittance papers for the alvarez cilnic .
about bloody time , fidel .
round up more girls and take them to room 42 .
unless you want to be known as fidei castrato .
magnificent view .
it is , isn't it?
too bad it's iost on everybody else .
mojito?
you should try it .
giacinta johnson .
my friends call me jinx .
my friends call me james bond .
jinx , you say?
born on friday the 1 3th .
do you belleve in bad iuck?
let's just say my relationships don't seem to iast .
i know the feellng .
the predators usually appear at sunset .
and why is that?
it's when their prey comes out to drink .
too strong for you?
i could iearn to like it .
if i had the time .
how much time have you got?
until dawn .
what about you?
i'm just here for the birds .
ornithologist .
ornithologist , huh?
now there's a mouthful .
so you're gonna be busy tonight with the owls then?
no owls in los organos .
nothing to see till the morning .
not out there anyway .
so , what do predators do ... ... when the sun goes down?
they feast ... ... ilke there's no tomorrow .
are you always this frisky?
i've been missing the touch of a good woman .
who says i'm good?
what do you want?
i don't need a wheelchair .
no?
you do now .
senor .
okay .
gracias .
isla los organos
so you are to have dna replacement therapy .
let me explain the two phases .
first , we kill off your bone marrow .
wipe the dna slate clean .
introduction of new dna harvested from healthy donors .
orphans , runaways ... ... people that won't be missed .
i like to think of myself as an artist .
and this is when i create .
thank you .
it is a painfui process , i'm afraid , but ... ... all great art is .
i'll certainly enjoy working on you .
of course , most artists are only truly appreciated ... ... after they're dead .
my father was a sergeant .
we lived in hampshire .
i have fond memories of the countryside .
good .
got your attention .
who's bankrolling your makeover , zao?
same person who set me up in north korea?
james?
what's going on?
jinx , you gotta get out of here now !
move !
move !
move it !
let's go !
you see , my friend , the chemicai composition shows ... ... this is from sierra leone .
confilct diamonds .
there's some kind of marking here .
" gg .
let me see .
yes .
from the graves corporation in iceland .
that's his iaser signature .
a man called gustav graves discovered diamonds there ... ... a year or so ago .
yet they're identicai to confilct diamonds .
what an amazing coincidence .
how can he escape from a british warship ... ... in the middle of hong kong harbor , right under your nose?
interesting station , moneypenny?
i got a storm warning .
you were supposed to throw away the key ... ... not leave the door wide open .
are you implying i had a hand in his escape?
well , bond got away real fast , didn't he?
it is what he's trained to do .
your boy's been very busy .
he torches a clinic in cuba .
listen , you put your house in order ... ... or we're gonna do it for you .
your drink , sir .
lucky i asked for it shaken .
when's he coming?
i don't know .
looks like your man won't make it .
he's right on time .
wonderfui day to become a knight .
will you be using your title , mr. graves?
i'm proud of my adopted nation , but i'd never stand on ceremony .
after that entrance , you can't be surprised ... ... you're called a self pubilcizing adrenallne junkie , can you?
i prefer " adventurer .
we've heard about the icarus space program .
what's the secret?
it's a surprise .
you'll soon be enilghtened .
you work 24l7 .
is it true that you don't need sleep?
you get one shot at llfe .
why waste it on sleep?
aren't you trying out for the olympic fencing team?
we hear you're training furiously .
i never get furious .
as they say in fencing , " what's the point?
thank you .
we don't want to keep her majesty waiting any ionger .
mr. graves .
mr. graves .
hit .
that's a hit .
hit .
verity?
james bond .
your iesson .
i see you handle your weapon well .
i have been known to keep my tip up .
do you mind?
i think i've come undone .
why not?
hit .
positions .
play .
feast your eyes on the finest blade in the club .
gustav graves?
his pubilcist , miranda frost .
my protg .
gorgeous , isn't she?
she took the gold at sydney .
by default , if i remember .
default?
the one who beat her od'd on steroids .
miranda deserved that gold .
now she's teaching graves how to win one .
he only plays for cash .
he's won so much , nobody else wants to fight him .
you wanna meet him?
absolutely .
lead on .
gustav?
verity .
and mr ...?
bond .
james bond .
have we met before?
i think i'd remember .
of course you would .
my mistake .
are you a gambilng man , mr. bond?
if the stakes are right .
a thousand a point too much for you?
care to place a bet , verity?
no , thanks .
i don't like cockfights .
shall we?
excuse me .
best of three hits?
positions .
ready .
play .
en garde .
hit .
positions .
play .
hit .
two nil .
do you want to continue?
you wanna up the wager?
how much can you afford?
let's play for this .
i picked it up in cuba .
i belleve it's one of yours .
my , my .
they do get around .
but then diamonds are for everyone .
brililant specimen .
completely flawless .
and chemically identicai to african confilct diamonds .
then you're about to iose something very precious .
positions .
ready .
play .
en garde .
oh , dear .
you want to continue?
of course i want to bloody continue !
but since we're upping the wager ... ... iet's up the weapons , shall we?
let's do this the old fashioned way .
first blood drawn from the torso .
that is enough !
it's just a llttle sport , miranda .
seems you beat me , mr. bond .
settle downstairs , shall we?
you're a rare challenge , mr. bond .
i'm putting on a scientific demonstration in iceland at the weekend .
icarus?
perhaps you could join us .
miranda , make the arrangements .
once i've smoothed things over with the club .
what would i do without you?
can i expect the pleasure of you in iceland?
i'm afraid you'll never have that pleasure .
excuse me , commander bond .
someone ieft this for you .
place needed redecorating anyway .
i heard of this place .
never thought i'd find myself here .
some things are best kept underground .
an abandoned station for abandoned agents .
your calling card .
so , what have you got on graves?
you burn me ... ... and now you want my help?
did you expect an apology?
i know you'll do whatever it takes to get the job done .
just like you .
the difference is , i won't compromise .
well , i don't have the iuxury of seeing things as black and white .
while you were away , the world changed .
not for me .
you're suspicious of graves , or i wouldn't be here right now .
so , what do you have?
nothing beyond the officiai biography .
orphan working in a diamond mine ... ... iearns engineering , makes a huge find in iceland and gives half of it to charity .
from nothing to everything in no time at all .
and his demonstration this weekend?
probably just another pubilcity stunt .
tell me what you know about this cuban cilnic .
gene therapy .
new identities courtesy of dna transplants .
so called " beauty parlor . " we'd heard rumors .
i didn't think it really existed .
it doesn't anymore .
zao got away , but he ieft these behind .
all from gustav graves 'mine .
i think it's a front for iaundering african confilct diamonds .
we need to tread carefully .
graves is polltically connected .
lucky i'm on the outside , then .
it seems you've become usefui again .
then maybe it's time you iet me get on with my job .
forgive my mentioning it , but a perfect marksman ... ... isn't really supposed to shoot his own boss .
check the replay .
you'll find he's dead and she's only got a flesh wound .
there's always an excuse , isn't there , double o zero?
give me the old firing range any day .
yes , but it's called the future , so get used to it .
so this is where they keep the old rellcs , then , eh?
this is where our most cutting edge technology is developed .
point taken .
must you touch everything?
does this still work?
now , iook ....
so where is this cutting edge stuff?
i'm trying to get to it .
weapon , please .
one pane unbreakable glass , one standard issue ring finger .
twist so .
voll .
ultra high frequency single digit sonic agitator unit .
you're cleverer than you iook .
better than iooking cleverer ... ... than you are .
follow me .
now , a new watch .
this will be your 20th , i belleve .
how time files .
yes , well , 007 ... ... why don't you estabilsh a record by returning this one .
your new transportation .
maybe you've been down here too iong .
the ultimate in british engineering .
you must be joking .
as i iearned from my predecessor ... ... i never joke about my work .
aston martin call it the vanquish , we call it the vanish .
very good .
adaptive camouflage .
tiny cameras project the image they see ... ... onto a llght emitting polymer skin on the opposite side .
to the casuai eye , as good as invisible .
ejector seat , torpedoes , target seeking shotguns to shoot down mobile objects .
the manual .
should be able to shoot through that in a couple of hours .
just took a few seconds , q.
wish i could make you vanish .
come in .
before you ieave on your mission for iceland ... ... tell me what you know of james bond .
he's a double o.
a wild one , as i discovered today .
he'll llght the fuse on any explosive situation ... ... and be a danger to himself and others .
kill first , ask questions iater .
his method is to provoke and confront .
a man nobody can get close to .
a womanizer .
you're going to be seeing a iot more of him in iceland .
with great respect , a man like him could blow my cover .
you volunteered for this , but in three months , you've found next to nothing .
graves seems to be clean .
mix things up a llttle with mr. graves .
with you there ... ... things won't get out of hand .
in your three years in cryptology , you've kept business and pleasure separate .
you haven't fraternized with any of your fellow agents , despite severai advances .
it would be foollsh to get involved with someone within the community .
especially james bond .
