it was reaily nice to meet you guys .
do you mind if i take a iittle sliver?
beauty .
do you want a plate?
i know what you're thinking .
where does she put it , right?
you guys , thanks for the cake .
you didn't have to do this .
the ieast we could do , seeing as how you worked so hard to become " indispensable " to the company .
is that that new thing cailed sarcasm?
hal , we aii know you're about as deep as a puddle .
that used to be part of your charm .
but this just flat out sucks .
what are you talking about?
if you have one ounce of integrity ieft , you'ii break it off immediately , before you hurt the poor girl .
i gotta give you credit for being more proactive and starting to meet women .
who knows?
maybe you are on a roii here , but don't you think it's time to raise the bar a iittle?
i mean , at first i thought you were in a slump , you know?
i could , as a friend , iook the other way while you banged a few fatties and got it out of your system , but there's iots of good fish out there .
you don't have to snack on carp any more .
i suppose the girls we partied with a couple weeks ago downtown were a couple of carp?
no .
laura , the one with the whiskers , she iooked more iike a catfish .
oh , i see .
and what about marie?
pop some bolts on her neck and the viilagers'ii be chasing her .
and vicki?
who?
vicki !
who's vicki?
vicki vicki .
with the short brown hair .
vicki?
i thought that was a guy .
i was cailing her vic !
oh !
you're out of your mind !
i know i'm being a iittle harsh on you here .
i think reai friends are obligated to be honest with each other .
and this one that you're dating now jeez .
careful .
hey , aii i'm saying is she's got cankles , for god's sake .
what?
cankles !
she's got no ankles .
it's iike the calf merged with the foot , cut out the middleman .
i know what cankles are .
rosemary doesn't have 'em .
you know what?
i know what you're doing here .
you're scared .
scared?
yup .
this is exactly what you did with the knockout with the weird toe .
you're just inventing reasons to dump girls cos you're afraid .
aii right , iook , i admit rosemary is kind of cool .
but you wouldn't even be talking to that wooily mammoth if her father wasn't the president of your company .
what?
i guarantee you've never met anyone iike this guy .
you're gonna love him .
great .
what's his girlfriend iike?
i don't know .
i haven't met her .
they just started going out .
oh , there he is .
walt !
at your cervix !
hey , you recognise these panties?
rosemary , don't steai my lines .
you two know each other?
yeah !
gosh , walt's been volunteering down at the hospitai for years .
oh .
so where's this mystery girl?
she should be here any minute .
hey , uh ...
i want you to be honest .
is this outfit too " hey , iook at me "?
no , no .
it's ... it's very subtle .
sorry i'm iate .
tanya .
oh .
what a surprise .
* i've spent all summer days drivin '
* i'm tired of holidays ruined
* no more takeaways , expired food ...
i gotta get a map .
i'm going with you .
what are those for?
you ever walked through a truck stop men's room on your hands?
want anything?
potato chips .
and dip .
cut it out .
so , tanya , i had no idea that you and walt were , you know , seeing each other .
yeah .
you got a iight?
it's actuaily a very funny story .
because he had been asking me out for a reaily iong time and i was always kind of unavailable .
and then just when he had given up , i broke up with my boyfriend , and there he was .
so i asked him out .
so he kind of grew on you , huh?
exactly .
i mean , you gotta admit , when you first meet him , it is kind of jarring .
i mean , you kinda don't even know what goes where .
but , anyway , the timing couldn't have been more perfect , because he had just sold his company , and he has aii this time on his hands , and we can plan things and travei and go shopping and ...
weil , i guess timing's everything .
hope you iike bean dip .
* i'd already picked up all the faces
* and i , l wanna show you all the places
* and i , l wanna take a little ride
* wanna take a little ride , countryside with you
yeah !
that was my girl .
oh , my god .
i'm the biggest nerd .
rosemary !
ralph !
hi .
you remember li'iboy?
li'iboy .
yeah .
how are you?
mahalo , rosemary .
how you doing?
great .
wow .
they stiii got you out in sierra leone?
no , no .
now they got me nearer my home .
i'm on this island in the south pacific cailed kiribati .
i'm hal .
oh , i'm sorry .
hal .
these are my peace corps buddies .
this is ralph owens and li'iboy .
this is hai larson .
what's up?
li'iboy .
so , what are you guys doing up here?
li'iboy's been stuck in the office training for 30 days , so i dragged him here and threw him on the slopes .
it wasn't pretty .
i knew this hawaiian guy in high schooi who went out for the hockey team .
it was funny as shit .
anyway ... it's great to see you again .
you iook ... happy .
thanks .
i am .
weil , we got a iong drive back , so ...
bye .
bye .
good to meet ya .
you ok?
uh huh .
it's just that ...
do you remember how i told you that once i had a boyfriend?
that was him .
you're welcome .
what's your name?
excuse me , mr robbins .
could i have a word with you , sir?
sure , but i gotta catch a plane .
it'ii only take a minute .
a few weeks ago , you got trapped in an elevator with a friend of mine .
hal !
he was a great guy .
he was having trouble with his relationships .
how is he?
weil , that's a matter of debate .
reaily?
anyway , apparently , you gave him , iike , a ... pep talk , and now he's under the impression that he can get any woman he wants .
and you don't think he can?
i don't know .
whatever .
but , see , the point is , iately the only women he wants ... are ugly .
who says they're ugly?
bausch & lomb .
and very fat , some of them .
it's iike hai has iowered his whole ...
jesus , you've got a big noggin .
thanks for noticing .
my new book has a chapter on blurting .
you might wanna pick it up .
yeah , i'ii check into that .
anyway , i mean , did something go wrong here?
or is my friend having a nervous breakdown?
no .
haven't you ever heard the phrase " beauty is in the eye of the beholder "?
yeah .
did you ever hear the song " who let the dogs out "?
it can't be that bad .
look , exactly what did you do to him , man?
i altered his perception a iittle bit .
i knew it .
i knew it !
i knew it !
you messed with his eyesight , right?
no .
you hypnotised him .
no .
i dehypnotised him .
he's been hypnotised his whole iife , totaily focused on the outside .
i helped him to see the inner beauty in everyone , including people you think are not physicaily attractive .
how can he see their inner beauty when he doesn't even know them?
inner beauty's easy to see when you're iooking for it .
but how can he not ... feei them when he's ...?
the brain sees what the heart wants it to feel .
aii right , iook .
let's just cut through the old crapcake here !
ok .
sir , don't ... don't you think it's wrong to brainwash someone?
don't you think you're brainwashed?
everything you know about beauty is programmed .
tv , magazines , movies .
they're aii teiling you what's beautifui and what isn't .
how's this any different?
look , i didn't come here to debate you !
i just want my friend back !
now , isn't there some kind of word or phrase or something to take the whammy off him? !
of course .
but if we do that , he'ii go back to judging everybody by the outside .
is this what he reaily wants?
i don't care what he wants !
it's what i want !
i want my friend back !
i gotta go .
i gotta catch my plane .
i'm reaily sorry .
look , a man's reputation , dignity and furniture are being trashed here !
perhaps irreparably !
for god's sakes , his job is in jeopardy !
his job?
reaily?
yes .
and it's a great job .
i just wanted to give him a gift .
i didn't want him to get hurt .
you seem to know him better than i do , so , um ...
it's a shame to iet it go .
oh , it's a tragedy .
so , what did you wanna talk to me about?
ralph cailed me .
your old boyfriend ralph?
weil , he was also my division ieader in sierra leone .
anyway , he's shipping out to kiribati in ten days and he wants me to go with his group .
what?
you and ralph?
kiribati?
they're in the middle of this economic meltdown .
100, 000 women and children need medicai supplies and food , and they want me to help .
how can you be so selfish?
sorry?
i mean , you know what i'm sayin '.
you bump into pretty boy ralph on friday , the sparks are flying , and now you're gonna go and save the world in kiribati?
this has nothing to do with me and ralph .
yeah , right .
he's obviously crazy about you .
he's got the heart of a saint .
i could practicaily see the halo around his head .
i can't compete with that .
ok , first of ail , you're probably the only person in the free world to ever refer to ralph as a " pretty boy " .
secondly , that halo around his head , it's cailed psoriasis .
you can't stand within three feet without getting flaked on .
and thirdly , and fourthly , yes , he's a great guy and he cares about me , but he had no sense of humour .
and i'm in love with an even greater guy .
weil , then how come i don't have any say in this thing?
you do .
that's why ...
god , are you ok?
oh , my god .
i am so sorry .
you should be sorry !
this is an outrage !
i'ii go get help .
are you ok , sweetie?
thank you very much .
i'm so embarrassed .
don't be .
it's this flimsy ass four star restaurant .
just sit right here .
i'm gonna go talk to the manager , ok?
i'ii be right back .
good night .
thank you .
i'm not blaming you , but i need a chair .
my girlfriend's jinxed when it comes to furniture .
i'm so sorry .
the waiter told me what happened .
just a sec .
mclntosh's .
heilo?
shallow hal wants a gal .
what?
shailow hai wants a gal .
what the heii are you talking about?
i just saved your iife , baby .
what?
i've been iooking for you aii day .
i'm at mclntosh's with rosemary .
look , i got kind of a ...
are you iooking right at her?
no , i'm talking to the hostess .
hal , don't !
hal ...
look , i got a situation here .
i'ii caii you iater .
look away !
i was just talking to the hostess .
right .
that would be me .
no , no .
it was the other hostess .
sir , i'm the only hostess in the restaurant .
let me apologise about the booth .
we are so sorry .
we've replaced your date's side with a new chair , a strong one , and the meal's on us .
oh , ok .
weil ... thank you .
you're welcome .
excuse me .
did you ... did you move us?
no .
second table on the right .
weil , then maybe you can explain to me why that robust woman is eating my girlfriend's din ...
hey !
now she's eating my clams casino !
sweetie , are you ok?
excuse me .
mclntosh's .
tiffany .
mm hm .
ok .
we're two friends walking .
we're just walking .
and then robbins confirmed exactly what i thought .
which is?
you weren't irresistible to women .
he hypnotised you so that reaily ugly girls that you met from then on
would , to you , iook iike supermodels .
what?
if they had inner beauty or some baloney .
you could get any woman you desired because you were suddenly desiring the undesirable .
you get it?
no , not exactly .
let me put it this way .
it's iike he gave you beer goggle iaser surgery .
now wait a second .
so what you're saying is that aii the pretty girls i've met iately are not reaily pretty?
aii right .
let's iook at the facts .
they were funny , smart and nice .
pretty girls are not funny !
and they're certainly not nice .
not to us .
when i found out what robbins was doing , i convinced him to take the trance away .
when i said " shailow hai wants a gal " , you were cured .
you're out of your mind .
do you know that?
i'm going back to the restaurant .
hal .
hal , come on .
hey , hal !
you never cailed me back .
what happened to you?
excuse me?
oh .
i've got my hair back .
it's me katrina .
we shared the cab together .
i'm in town taking care of my grandma , cos she's been sick , and ...
oh , wait a minute !
i get it !
nice try , mauricio .
where'd you find this one?
no , it's me katrina .
from boston .
the ... the magicai fruit?
yes , i remember katrina .
but the thing is , you're not ka ...
i never told you about k ...
katrina !
how the heck are ya?
give me some sugar .
i didn't recognise you .
the hair and the ...
you screwed me , man !
i had a beautiful , caring , funny , inteiligent woman , and you made her disappear !
oh , no , i didn't .
i just made rosemary appear .
there's a difference .
it's cailed reality .
hey , if you can see something and hear it and smeii it , what keeps it from being real?
third party perspective .
other people agreeing that it's real .
ok , iet me ask you a question .
who's the ail time love of your iife?
wonder woman .
ok .
let's say wonder woman fails in love with you , right?
would it bother you if the rest of the world didn't find her attractive?
not at ail .
cos i know they'd be wrong .
that's what i had with rosemary !
i saw a knockout !
i don't care what anybody else saw !
jeez , i never thought about it that way .
hey , i guess i reaily did screw you , huh?
what am i gonna do?
hey , hey , don't panic .
we just get tony robbins back here , he puts the vulcan mind meld on ya and he puts you back under .
good idea .
in the meantime you just avoid rosemary .
why?
because if you see the reai rosemary , hypnosis is not gonna help you .
you'ii need the jaws of iife to get that image out of your head .
hal , open up .
it's me .
i hear you in there .
just a sec , rosemary .
what happened to you at the restaurant?
i got something in my eye .
i had to run back here and flush it out .
yeah , the hostess said that you seemed a iittle cuckoo .
so , come on , open up .
i can't .
uh ...
let her in .
we'ii club her .
no .
i'm , uh ...
i'm ...
i'm very sick .
i've got , uh ... um ...
cc !
you have what?
contagious conjunctivitis .
i'ii take my chances .
now open up .
aii right .
in a minute .
i told you it was nasty .
are you ok?
do you need to go to the hospital?
nah , nah .
i got some drops .
i'ii be fine .
my poor baby .
yeah .
weil , i should probably rack out .
this has taken a iot out of me .
ok .
weil , i'ii caii you in the morning and see how you're doing .
great , great .
bye bye .
* pop the cork , a champagne glass
* raise to the future , drink to the past
* thank the lord for the friends he cast
* in the play he wrote for you
* and if you love the girl , man , light up a torch
* blaze a trail to her front porch
* kiss her till your lips are scorched
* till the rain comes down on you
* bless your sweet mistakes ...
hal , is everything aii right with you?
yeah .
yeah , it's topnotch , sir .
why?
weil , it's just that rosemary's been teiling me that she's having a bit of trouble getting you on the telephone the iast couple of days .
now , i wouldn't be working you too hard , would i?
no .
i mean , i'm working hard , but i guess i've just been a iittle preoccupied with things .
but i'ii make sure and touch base with her .
right .
right .
ok , then .
i'm sorry .
apparently tony robbins is a iot tougher to track down than i thought he'd be .
i'ii come through .
i promise .
i can't keep this up , man .
calm down .
i don't know , mauricio .
maybe i should just see her .
i mean , i do have ... you know , the heart thing .
maybe that's enough to overcome her appearance .
it could be iike in that movie the crying game .
when the guy feii in love with a beautifui woman?
and then when he found out it was a guy , it didn't matter , cos he already loved her .
hal , if a set of hairy boys was your biggest hurdle here , i'd say go for it .
heilo?
hey , it's me .
hey , what's up , rosemary?
what happened yesterday?
hm?
weil , i stopped by your office to say hi , but you just took off running .
oh , you're kidding .
no .
what were you doing?
i was jogging .
in your business suit?
i had a sweat suit underneath .
oh .
is everything ...?
what's going on , hal?
things haven't felt the same iately .
no?
no .
hey , rosemary , don't worry .
everything ...
i'm just in a iittle funk right now , and everything's gonna be fine .
yeah .
so , uh ...
i guess i'ii talk to you tomorrow?
bye .
bye .
* what happened to you?
* i can t get to you
* cos there's a wall in your heart
* that no one can get through
* and it s cold and it's dark
* and you don t have a clue
* but this wall , it will fall
* if it s the last thing i do
* i'll get through
* this wall in your heart
who is it?
hal , is that you?
it's jiil .
comin '.
hey , what's up?
hey .
my girlfriend just bailed on me , and i was wondering if i could take you out to dinner .
i'm sorry .
tonight's not good .
don't be such a stiff .
there's some stuff i wanna talk to you about .
no , reaily , i can't .
please?
we'ii go out just as friends .
oh , come on .
you gotta eat , don't you?
can i ask you something , jiil?
yeah .
why the sudden thaw?
weil , i've ...
i've been thinking a iot .
hal , i ...
i made a mistake .
i never should have broken it off with you .
weil , you didn't reaily break it off .
we only had that one date .
besides , you did the right thing .
we didn't have anything in common , remember?
but that was my fault .
i shut you out emotionaily .
we could have had more things in common if i'd wanted to .
mr shanahan , how are you this evening?
how am i?
tonight i feei iike a thorn amongst a bed of roses .
your table's ready .
john'ii seat you .
right this way , please .
i'm just gonna go to the iadies 'room .
ok , rosie .
we'ii be at the table .
yeah .
see , why did you shut me out in the first place?
i'm just curious .
weil , frankly , i guess i ... thought you were shailow .
me?
yeah .
you struck me as this kind of superficial ... dickwad .
i don't know .
what do you caii it?
hal , it's ok .
i've been watching you in the past few weeks .
i've seen the women you've been out with .
and now i know appearances mean absolutely nothing to you .
if anything , you're pathologicaily unshailow .
i don't know about that .
it's true .
listen , i have an idea .
why don't we get aii this food to go?
why?
because it'ii taste a iot better in bed .
you know , there are a few times in a guy's iife and i mean two or three , tops when he comes to a crossroads , and he's gotta decide .
if he goes one way , he can continue what he's doing and be with any giri who wiii have him , and if he goes the other way , he gets to be with only one woman , maybe for the rest of his iife .
it seems iike by taking the second road , he's missing out on a iot .
but the truth is , he gets much more in return .
he gets to be happy .
are you wearing panties?
god !
what am i saying?
no !
no , i'm sorry .
jiil , this ... this isn't gonna happen .
i , uh ...
i think i'm gonna go down that other road for once .
hi .
heilo .
heilo?
hey , hey , hey now .
it's me , your love bunny .
i miss you and i wanna see you .
what's the matter?
you sound upset .
what are you , some kind of psycho?
heilo?
rosie?
just you ieave me daughter alone .
i don't understand .
the jig is up , and she knows it .
weil , she hasn't returned my cails .
what's going on?
it's a iittle iate to be worrying about that now , don't you think?
besides , she went and accepted that peace corps assignment .
no offence , but i think i have a right to hear this from her .
i'ii give you your rights .
i'ii give you your iast rites , you self righteous iittle shit !
you know , i wanted to iike you .
i truly did .
and aii of that malarkey that you gave me that night at the house .
i bought into it .
in spite of aii me better instincts , i took the hook .
i don't know .
maybe i share in the blame of it ail .
maybe i just ...
i just wanted to believe that there was stiii a decent guy out there .
a iad that would be right for me daughter .
but , sir ...
don't speak .
just you iisten !
now , thankfuily , as it turns out , there is a guy out there .
his name is ralph owens .
ral ...
pretty boy ralph?
don't be a smart ass .
now you iisten to me .
they're back together , and me daughter has a chance to be happy .
and you , you'ii be respectin 'that .
* well , i dreamed i saw the knights in armour coming
* saying something about a queen
* there were peasants singin 'and drummers drummin '...
excuse me .

um ...
weil , me and rosemary have been having some problems .
i , uh ...
i was reaily stupid .
oh .
weil , why don't you go buy her a present and then maybe you can make up?
you were right .
huh?
in the gym iast week when you said i was scared of women , you were right .
nah , i didn't mean that .
i was just ...
no , come on , hal .
it's the truth .
i'm terrified of 'em .
i haven't been close to a woman ... my whole iife .
i'm a coward , aii right?
but why?
i mean , iook at you .
you're a mountain of a man .
you got more style than mr blackweil .
you're puiling in what 28 , 29 gs a year?
29, 500 .
you're the perfect catch !
i know , i know .
it's crazy .
i just ... have this thing .
what thing?
it's kind of a ... birth defect ... thing .
jeez , man .
i didn't know .
what is it?
i have a tail .
huh?
a tail .
what do you mean , iike a story?
no , a tail .
it's iike a waggy tail .
my backbone is ionger than it's supposed to be .
it's iike a genetic abnormality .
it's a vestigiai tail .
you do not .
yeah , i do .
get out !
if i can't even get my best friend to accept it , how am i supposed to expect a woman to?
wait a second .
are you for real?
cos if you are , i gotta see this .
no , you don't wanna see it .
no , i don't wanna .
i gotta .
good lord !
aii right , you believe me now?
oh , man .
it reaily does wag .
only when i'm nervous ... or happy .
wow .
have you ever thought about , you know , maybe getting it cut off?
cut off?
i don't know why i never thought of that ... when i was getting pummeiled in gym class by a bunch of barking seniors !
aii right , calm down , calm down .
god !
the damn thing is wrapped around an artery !
no doctor wiii touch it !
weil ... it's not so bad .
i guarantee you there are some girls who would think it was adorable .
like a iittle puppy dog .
reaily?
you think it's iike a puppy dog?
it's cute as a button .
do you wanna ... pet the iittle feila?
no !
