halt !
halt !
stop !
what?
stop !
stop !
you're going the wrong way .
we have to get to berlin .
brody's this way .
my diary's in berlin .
we don't need the diary , dad .
marcus has the map .
there is more in the diary than just the map .
all right , dad .
tell me .
well , he who finds the grail must face the final challenge .
what final challenge?
three devices of such lethal cunning .
booby traps?
oh , yes .
but i found the clues that will safely take us through , in the chronicles of st. anselm .
well , what are they?
can't you remember?
i wrote them down in my diary so that i wouldn't have to remember .
half the german army's on our tail , and you want me to go to berlin?
into the lion's den?
yes .
the only thing that matters is the grail .
what about marcus?
marcus would agree with me .
two selfless martyrs .
jesus christ .
that's for blasphemy .
the quest for the grail is not archaeology .
it's a race against evil .
if it is captured by the nazis , the armies of darkness will march all over the face of the earth .
do you understand me?
this is an obsession , dad .
i never understood it .
never .
neither did mom .
oh , yes , she did .
only too well .
unfortunately , she kept her illness from me until all i could do was mourn her .
my boy , we are pilgrims in an unholy land .
fraulein doctor .
where is it?
how did you get here?
where is it?
i want it .
you came back for the book?
why?
my father didn't want it incinerated .
is that what you think of me?
i believe in the grail , not the swastika .
but you stood up to be counted with the enemy of everything that the grail stands for .
who gives a damn what you think?
you do .
all i have to do is squeeze .
all i have to do is scream .
i've got it .
let's get the hell out of here .
what did you get?
i don't know .
first available flight out of germany .
good .
well , we made it .
when we're airborne , with germany behind us , then i'll share that sentiment .
relax .
tickets , please .
guten tag ... herr jones .
tickets , please .
oh , we should get out of here .
no ticket .
ticket .
ticket !
ticket !
ticket ! ticket !
you know , sharing your adventures is an interesting experience .
that's not all we shared .
it's disgraceful .
you're old enough to be her fa ... her her grandfather .
well , i'm as human as the next man .
i was the next man .
oh .
of course .
well ... ships that pass in the night .
do you remember the last time we had a quiet drink , hmm?
i had a milkshake .
hmm?
what did we talk about?
we didn't talk .
we never talked .
do i detect a rebuke?
a regret .
it was just the two of us , dad .
it was a lonely way to grow up .
for you , too .
if you'd been an ordinary , average father ,
like the other guys 'dads , you'd have understood that .
actually , i was a wonderful father .
when?
did i ever tell you to eat up?
go to bed?
wash your ears?
do your homework?
no .
i respected your privacy , and i taught you self reliance .
what you taught me was that i was less important to you than people who'd been dead for 500 years in another country .
and i learned it so well that we've hardly spoken for 20 years .
you left just when you were becoming interesting .
unbelievable .
dad , how can you ...?
very well .
i'm here now .
what do you want to talk about?
hmm?
well , i ... uh ...
i can't think of anything .
then what are you complaining about?
look , we have work to do .
when we get to alexandretta , we will face three challenges .
the first ,
the breath of god .
only the penitent man will pass .
second ,
the word of god .
only in the footsteps of god will he proceed .
third ,
the path of god .
only in the leap from the lion's head will he prove his worth .
what does that mean?
i don't know .
we'll find out .
we're turning around .
they're taking us back to germany .
well , i thought it would take them a lot longer to figure out the radio was dead .
come on , dad .
move !
come on , dad .
come on !
i didn't know you could fly a plane .
fly , yes .
land , no .
dad , you're going to have to use the machine gun .
get it ready .
eleven o'clock !
dad , eleven o'clock !
what happens at eleven o'clock?
twelve , eleven , ten .
eleven o'clock , fire !
dad , are we hit? !
more or less .
son , i'm sorry .
they got us .
hang on , dad .
we're going in !
nice landing .
thanks .
those people are trying to kill us !
i know , dad !
well .
it's a new experience for me .
it happens to me all the time .
this is intolerable !
this could be close .
faster , boy !
faster !
well , they don't come any closer than that !
dad , he's coming back !
i suddenly remembered my charlemagne .
let my armies be the rocks and the trees and the birds in the sky .
these pages are taken from professor jones 'diary , your highness , and they include a map that pinpoints the exact location of the grail .
as you can see , the grail is all but in our hands .
however , your highness , we would not think of crossing your soil without your permission , nor of removing the grail from your borders without suitable compensation .
what have you brought?
precious valuables , your highness , donated by some of the finest families in all of germany .
ah !
rolls royce phantom two .
four point three liter , 30 horsepower , six cylinder engine , with stromberg downdraft carburetor .
can go from zero to 100 kilometers an hour in 12 . 5 seconds .
and i even like the color .
the keys are in the ignition , your highness .
you shall have camels , horses , an armed escort , provisions , desert vehicles and tanks .
you're welcome .
we have no time to lose .
indiana jones and his father have escaped .
we go this way .
get that camel out of the way .
what happened to marcus , sallah?
ah , they set out across the desert this afternoon .
i believe they took mr. brody with them .
now they have the map .
and in this sort of race , there's no silver medal for finishing second .
care to wet your whistle , marcus?
i'd rather spit in your face .
but as i haven't got any spit ... must be within three or four miles .
otherwise we are off the map .
well , marcus , we are on the brink of the recovery of the greatest artifact in the history of mankind .
you're meddling with powers you cannot possibly comprehend .
ah , i see brody .
he seems okay .
they've got a tank .
six pound gun .
what do you think you're doing there?
get down !
dad , we're well out of range .
that car belonged to my brother in law .
come on , come on !
i can't see anyone up there .
maybe it wasn't even jones .
no , it is him , all right .
he's here somewhere .
put brody in the tank .
well , in this sun , without transportation , they're as good as dead .
it's jones , all right .
now , who are all these people?
who cares?
as long as they're keeping donovan busy .
dad , you stay here while sallah and i organize some transportation .
i'm going after those horses .
i'll take the camels .
i don't need camels .
but , indy ... no camels .
who is he?
a messenger from god .
for the unrighteous , the cup of life holds everlasting damnation .
marcus !
oh .
genius of the restoration ... " " aid our own resuscitation .
henry , what are you doing here?
it's a rescue , old boy .
come on .
search him .
what is in this book?
that miserable little diary of yours .
we have the map .
the book is useless .
and yet you come all the way back to berlin to get it .
why?
what are you hiding?
what does the diary tell you that it doesn't tell us?
it tells me that goose stepping morons like yourself should try reading books instead of burning them .
colonel !
jones is getting away .
i think not , herr donovan .
not that jones , the other jones !
sallah , i said no camels !
that's five camels .
can't you count?
compensation for my brother in law's car .
indy , your father and brody ... where's my father?
they have them .
in the belly of that steel beast .
hyah !
hyah , hyah , hyah !
hey ah , hey ah , hey ah !
fire !
dad !
dad !
dad !
junior?
junior? !
junior !
dad !
dad !
dad !
get out !
henry , the pen ...
what?
but don't you see?
the pen is mightier than the sword .
look what you did .
it's war .
didn't i tell you it was a rescue , huh?
dad !
yeah?
you call this archaeology?
get out of there , dad .
how does one get off this thing?
where's marcus?
dad !
hang on , dad !
father of indy , give me your hand !
sallah !
get dad !
give me your hand !
junior !
indy !
oh , god .
i've lost him .
and i never told him anything .
i just wasn't ready , marcus .
five minutes would have been enough .
i thought i'd lost you , boy !
i thought you had too , sir .
mmm ...
well ... well done .
come on .
let's go , then .
why are you sitting there resting when we're so near the end? !
come on , let's go !
the canyon of the crescent moon .
helmut , another volunteer !
i never expected to see you again .
i'm like a bad penny ; i always turn up .
step back now , dr .
schneider .
give dr .
jones some room .
he's going to recover the grail for us .
impossible?
what do you say , jones?
ready to go down in history?
as what?
a nazi stooge like you?
the nazis? !
is that the limit of your vision?
the nazis want to write themselves into the grail legend ... take on the world .
well , they're welcome .
but i want the grail itself .
the cup that gives everlasting life .
hitler can have the world , but he can't take it with him .
i'm going to be drinking my own health when he's gone the way of the dodo .
the grail is mine ... and you're going to get it for me .
shooting me won't get you anywhere .
you know something , dr .
jones?
you're absolutely right .
dad?
dad? !
junior ...
no !
get back !
you can't save him when you're dead !
the healing power of the grail is the only thing that can save your father now .
it's time to ask yourself what you believe .
the breath of god ... ... only the penitent man will pass .
the penitent man will pass .
the penitent man will pass .
the penitent man ... " only the penitent man will pass .
only the penitent man will pass .
the penitent man will pass .
the penitent , penitent ... the penitent man ... the penitent man ... the penitent ... the penitent man is humble before god .
penitent .
penitent ... the penitent man ... penitent man is humble ... ... kneels before god .
kneel !
i'm through !
we're through .
he's all right .
no .
the word of god .
only in the footsteps of god will he proceed .
the word of god ... the word of ...
proceed in the footsteps of the word .
the word of god ... " no , henry .
try not to talk .
the name of god ... the name of god ...
jehovah .
but in the latin alphabet , jehovah begins with an " i.
j ...
oh , dear .
idiot !
in latin , jehovah starts with an " i.
l " ...
e " ...
h " ...
o " ... oh !
v " ...
a " ...
the path of god .
only in the leap from the lion's head will he prove his worth .
impossible ... nobody can jump this .
indy !
indy , you must hurry !
come quickly !
it's a leap of faith .
oh , geez ... you must believe , boy .
you must ... believe .
oh .
i knew you'd come , but my strength has left me .
who are you?
the last of three brothers who swore an oath to find the grail and to guard it .
that was 700 years ago .
a long time to wait .
you're strangely dressed ... for a knight .
i'm not exactly ... a knight .
what do you mean?
i was chosen because i was the bravest , the most worthy .
the honor was mine until another came to challenge me to single combat .
i pass it ... to you who vanquished me .
listen , i don't have time to explain , but ...
which one is it?
you must choose , but choose wisely .
for as the true grail will bring you life , the false grail will take it from you .
i'm not a historian .
i have no idea what it looks like .
which one is it?
let me choose .
thank you , doctor .
oh , yes .
it's more beautiful than i'd ever imagined .
this certainly is the cup of the king of kings .
eternal life .
what is happening to me?
oh !
tell me , what is happening?
he chose ... poorly .
it would not be made out of goid .
that's the cup of a carpenter .
there's only one way to find out .
you have chosen wisely .
but the grail cannot pass beyond the great seal .
that is the boundary and the price of immortality .
drop your guns .
please .
dad , come on , get to your feet .
we have got it .
come on !
elsa !
elsa , don't move !
it's ours , indy ... yours and mine .
elsa , don't cross the seal .
the knight warned us not to take the grail from here .
junior !
junior !
elsa ...
elsa , don't .
elsa ...
elsa ... give me your other hand , honey .
i can't hold you !
i can reach it .
i can reach it .
elsa , give me your hand .
give me your other hand !
elsa !
junior , give me your other hand !
i can't hold on .
i can get it .
i can almost reach it , dad .
indiana ...
indiana ...
let it go .
dad ...
please , dad .
elsa never really believed in the grail .
she thought she'd found a prize .
what did you find , dad?
me?
illumination .
and what did you find , junior?
junior "?
dad ... please , what does it always mean , this ... this " junior "?
henry jones , junior .
i like indiana .
we named the dog indiana .
may we go home now , please?
the dog?
you are named after the dog?
i've got a lot of fond memories of that dog .
ready?
ready .
indy !
henry !
follow me .
i know the way !
ha !
got lost in his own museum , huh?
uh huh .
after you , junior .
yes , sir .
ha !
