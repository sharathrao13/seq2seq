precisely .
they seem shifty , they seem standoffish .
i mean , who knows from albania?

this is why we have to mobilize the b 3 bomber .

it'll just be a second .
miss , there are no electronics on the plane .
i really have to ask you to turn that off .

when you get the time , you can read the cover .
john levy is expected to respond to the firefly allegations ... ... of sexual misconduct by the president .
this guy is fucked .
what one has to do , mr. motss , is fight a holding action .
holding action?
they're going to run this man through the shredder .
if we can hold the break in the dam for 11 days till the election ... ... i think we got a chance .
you can't hold the dam .
i mean , how the hell
i don't get what you want me to do .
... advised him to stay on the ground in china for one or two days .
during that time , of course , we'll remain

it just makes good sense .
you don't want to change horses in midstream .
why are they sticking with this age old horseshit?

would you vote for that person based on that commercial?
you know , i don't vote .
why don't you vote?
last time i vote when that one time major league baseball started the fans voting ... ... i voted for boog powell on first base .
he didn't get in it ... ... and it just disappointed me .
stayed with me .
it's futile .
you've never voted for president?

i asked for a kitten .
i understand that , but the pet wrangler suggested
i think i need to speak to the president before you decide on the animal .
you don't understand .
can't they find me a kitten?
listen to me .
albanian terrorists have a staging area ... ... for their atomic workshop .
that's why she's fleeing .

let's say it was italy?
i can get a lot of cash if it's italy .
listen this concept .
the boot .

what if a shoe was the fad?
ok .
the little girl is coming toward the camera .

albania doesn't do anything for me .
i think that's the problem .
we're locked into albania .
why is that?
the president's gonna go to war with albania in about 30 minutes .
declaring war on albania?
no .
we're not declaring war .
we're going to war .
we haven't declared war since world war il .
we're going to war?
we're going to war .

we've just received information that ... ... the young albanian national fleeing in this video ... ... is attempting to escape terrorist reprisals in her village .
america has seldom witnessed ... ... a more poignant picture of the human race .

they used the same process ... ... with the last schwarzenegger movie .
fantastic .

i'll see you in nashville .
go to the two tone hat .
i don't care .
you work it out .
you must have had similar situations in the past .
there are unconfirmed reports at this time from a reliable source ... ... that things are in motion .
what i'm hearing and this is a quote ...
the president is looking for a swift ... ... painless , and victorious conclusion to the war .
however , the source will not go on record .
all i can tell you is this comes from the highest level .
new york times , washington post ... ... detroit register , sacramento bee ... ... all in remission .
no mention of the firefly girl .
none .
10 days to go .
big bird touches down when?
we bring him tomorrow at 5 a . m .
anything at the airport?
the press thought no .
what do you think?
here's what i think .
is it gonna rain?
can you give me the weather tomorrow morning?
andrews , 5 a . m .?
a young albanian girl ... ... dressed in her ... whatever .
is there some festival some harvest festival ... ... an albanian harvest festival , something like that?
get on this right away .
find me an harvest festival .
albanian harvest festival .
there's gotta be something .
anyway , she gives him the sacred whatever it is ... ... telling him this is a sacred traditional offering ... ... given to the man who ties the first sheaf ... ... the last sheaf , who the fuck knows what sheaf?
this is good .
is she saying this in albanian?
she's speaking in albanian ... ... because this is the only way it can be understood ... ... by her sacred , sainted , and aged mother .
we're picking them up now .
now the old lady starts to speak .
you have brought peace not only to this
no , no .
the child speaks .
a face of innocence , no cynicism .
the child says ...
are you getting this?
now , the old broad starts to break down and cry .
big bird shrugs off his secret service , goes over there ... ... covers her with his own coat , end of story .
can you find out if there is any chance we could get some rain at andrews tomorrow?
thank you .
how is big bird holding up by the way?
he's good .
he does want to know forget about the office .
what does your fellow motss want?
i don't know .
ambassador to togo .
no rain tomorrow at andrews , but we do have a rain at boca raton .
then direct the plane to boca .
ok .
connie says let's divert the plane to boca .
what's happening?
can i help you?
what's the problem?
we're really in a rush here .
do you know who we are?
i'm afraid that's the trouble , miss ames .
cla .
what am i gonna do?
i have a three year old daughter ... ... eventually headed for orthodonture .
oh , god .
now that the cla knows , i'm gonna lose everything ... my career , my reputation .
what am i gonna do?
brazen it through .
took you long enough?
we found them as soon as we could , sir .
all right .
after i'm done with them , what do they want me to do?
lug them back to the district or dump them in the country ... ... let the fbi trip over them?
legal department says you pick .
depends on what we want to do with them .
this is a newsbreak special report on the war in albania .
we've just received more details ... ... of the young albanian girl seen running for her life .
the young girl was trying to escape after hearing her family was killed .
apparently , there was a family connection in canada .
two things i know to be true ... ... there's no difference between good flan and bad flan ... ... and there is no war .
guess who i am .
i would like to point out that i am under medical care ... ... and taking medication , side effects of which have a little bit
quite touching .
i also take this opportunity ... ... to suggest that , equally , i admit to nothing ... ... and i would like my lawyer present .
we show , and nsa confirms ... ... there are no nuclear devices on the canadian border .
there are no nuclear devices in albania .
albania has no nuclear capacity .
our spy satellites show no secret terrorist training camps ... ... in the albanian hinterland .
the border patrol , the fbl , the rcmp report ... ... no repeat no untoward activity ... ... along our picturesque canadian border .
the albanian government is screaming its defense .
the world is listening .
there is no war .
of course , there's a war .
i'm watching it on television .
who might you be?
what you all said and done?
my name is conrad brean .
who do you work for?
nobody whose name you want me to say , mr. young .
i promise you .
so well and good , but when the fit hits the shan ... ... somebody has to stay after school .
who do you suppose that might be?
i don't know what you're talking about .
the spy satellites show it , mr. brean .
they show no war .
then what good are they if they show no war?
i mean , why we spend a quarter trillion dollars a year on defense department?
what good are they if they show nothing?
are they useless or just broken?
or what?
i would like to point out further ... ... that these medications taken in conjunction
if there's no threat , then where are you?
let me go one more .
if there's no threat , what good are you?
mr. brean , you are the threat .
i'm the threat?
i am the threat?
what have i been doing the last 30 years ... ... that you haven't been doing .
you wanna me fool in on that?
the last 30 years , mr. brean ... ... i have been working to ensure the security of my country .
i'm sure that speaks well of you and your parents ... ... but if forced to choose between the security of your country ... ... and the security of your job , which would you pick?
while you hesitate , permit me to suggest ... ... that they are one in the same .
your country and your job .
i'm doing my job , mr. brean .
that's what you see me doing .
i'm doing my job , too .
let me ask you something .
let me ask you a simple question .
why do people go to war?
why they go to war?
i'll play your silly game .
ok .
why they go to war?
to ensure their way of life .
would you fight to do that?
i have .
if you went to war again , who would it be against?
your ability to fight a two ocean war against who?
sweden and togo?
that time has passed .
it's over .
the war of the future is nuclear terrorism .
it'll be against a small group of dissidents ... ... who , unbeknownst perhaps to their own governments , have ...
to go to that war , you have to be prepared .
you gotta be alert .
the public has gotta be alert ... ... because that is the war of the future ... ... and if you're not gearing up to fight that war ... ... then eventually the ax will fall .
you'll be out in the street .
you can call this a drill , call this job security ... ... call it anything you like , but i got one for you .
you go to war to preserve your way of life .
chuck , this is your way of life .
and if your spy satellites don't see nothing ... ... if there ain't no war ... ... then you can go home and take up golf my friend ... ... 'cause there ain't no war but ours .
thank you .
drive carefully .
bye bye .
nice enough people .
they just hadn't thought it through .
you talked us out of there .
no , no .
we just got delayed .
we're going to nashville .
what?
i said you could talk a dog off a meat truck .
thank you .
no , no , no .
we just got stuck .
it's ok .
all systems five by five .
see you in nashville .
you saved our bacon .
it was just a phenomenal performance .
you turned them around .
you turned them around like a
they just hadn't thought it through .
he's moving across the tarmac .
but it appears something has distracted the president ... ... and he has stopped moving toward the waiting motorcade .
i appears there's a little girl ... ... trying to speak to the president .
it seems she's speaking in is it albanian?
can we get someone to translate?
dan , i think what she is saying ... ... is that this wheat offering is sort of ceremonial ... ... and that it is the first sheaf ... ... the first cut of the harvest .
i'm not proficient in albanian ... ... but the old woman is quite taken ... ... as the president is offering her the coat .
it is quite an emotional moment here .
# there comes a time in the course of human events ... #
# ... when a threat must be answered with courage and strength . #
# our forefathers earned the right to be free . #
# now it's time to guard their dream . #
# we guard our american borders . #
# we guard the american dream . #
# we guard our right to fight for democracy ... #
# ... and keep our country free . #
# we guard our american spirit . #
# we guard the american dream . #
# our country's built on the rock of liberty . #
# and we , as people must keep it free . #
# it is for life ... #
# ... liberty ... #
# ... the pursuit of happiness ... #
# ... freedom , 'tis of thee . #
# we guard our american borders . #
# we guard the american dream . #
i loved the fat , wet albanian broad .
thank you .
you know why?
it was understated .
you got lucky with the rain , too .
we had to divert the plane to boca raton .
you should have come to me .
we have rain machines .
i'm a producer .
i make rain .
next time .
i have just gotten word ... ... that the situation in albania is resolved ... ... that it is resolved .
the cla confirms ... ... that our troops along the canadian border ... ... and overseas are standing down .
i must take this opportunity to call upon our president to say
what does he mean , the situation has been resolved?
he just ended the war .
he ended the war?
why did he have to do that?
i think the cla has just cut a better deal .
he ended the war?
he can't end the war .
he's not producing this .
this is in bad taste .
can we stop this?
stop .
it's over .
can we stop this?
can we stop this?
stop the choir .
it has been quite a week , richard .
i can't remember when any president of united states ... ... was hit with the flu , a war ... ... and accused of sexual misconduct by a teenage girl ... ... all in the same seven day period .
this , of course , only days before he runs for reelection .
we've just received information from sources at the cla ... ... that confirms the cessation of hostilities ...
the cla .
i thought they let us out too easily .
the war's over .
it's over .
i saw it on television .
i have to sell my house .
the war is not over .
no .
the war is not over .
i saw it on tv .
that's what you hired me for .
the war isn't over until i say it's over .

this is my picture .
this is not the cla's picture .
you think you're in a tight spot now .
all right , conrad .
try making the four horsemen of the apocalypse .
tell it to him , king .
three of the horsemen died .
hear what he's saying?
three of the horsemen died ... ... two weeks before the end of principal photography .
this is nothing .
this is nothing .
this is just act one , " the war .

act two .
you know what it's like?
what?
the japanese .
in the caves .

okinawa .
they didn't believe the war was over .
that's right .
so , now we have a guy who doesn't believe
no , no .
we have an american serviceman .
a brave american serviceman is left behind .
a hero .
oh , my god .
i can't believe it .
what was i thinking?
we had a war .
we forgot the hero .
you can't have a war and not have a hero .
it's like we sent a christmas card ... ... and left out the what do you call it?
fruitcake .
there you go .
all right .

but i need a new song , ok?
a good old shoe song .

for the future of our families
the music .
where did they get that?
pain in the ass .
what?
what?
what?
he won't do it .
what do you mean he won't do it?
he won't do the speech .
what do you mean he won't do it?
he won't do the speech .
what do you mean?
what choice does he have?
what do you mean he won't do the speech?
he won't do our speech?
he says it's corny .
it's what?
it's corny?
corny?
of course it's corny .
we wouldn't have him say it if it wasn't corny .
it's not a question .
this is the center for rest of the thing .
don't tell me it's corny .
we're locked into the speech , right?
we're locked in .
we are playing way past this .
we are past this .
ok .
corny .
this is what i need .
i want you to get me 30 secretaries and put them in an office now .
would you do that?
you just tell him i'm coming up .
i need to see the president and five minutes of this time .
speech is corny .
know what this reminds me of?
years ago , when i first went out to hollywood ... ... they said to me , " it's too theatrical .
you know i was from the theater .
so , everything was over their heads .
it's too theatrical .
not theatrical .
he thinks it's too corny .
don't tell me the speech is corny .
just tell him i'm comin 'up .
i'm coming up .
my fellow americans , i thank a merciful god ... ... and i am sure each and every one of us ... ... will thank that supreme power ... ... whatever we conceive that power to be ... ... that peace is at hand .
the threat of nuclear terrorism has been quelled .
mr. president , i'm using a little more projection ... ... because i think this speech needs a little bit a " umph " .
bear with me .
thank you so much .
that was so moving .
thank you so much .
thank you .
you konow , connie?
i felt very much at home in there .
simple quirk of fate .
i could have gone this way .
it's all a change in wardrobe .
so , what do you think?
was it too much?
i'll tell you , stanley .
you did it .
yeah .
you did it .
you jumped in there ... ... and saved the thing when the thing needed saving .
you don't think it was too much?
personally?
maybe it was .
of course the president doesn't have to say it that way , connie .
it's like plato once said .
it doesn't matter how the fuck you get there as long as you get there .
he said that?
connie , what is it exactly you do for the president?
my fellow americans , i thank a merciful god ... ... and i'm sure all of us will thank that supreme power ... ... whatever we conceive that power to be ... ... that peace is at hand .
the threat of nuclear terrorism has been quelled .
we are in contact with the albanian premier ... ... who assures me and ... ... this government credits his assurances ... ... that his country does not wish us ill .
know any latin?
i , claudius .
that's what i know .
i need a latin motto for the patch .
the 303 patch . ... by a designation number , 303 .
a member of the group was left behind , what were then , enemy lines .
and i can only say to those family members of group 303 ... ... whose members are , i know as i speak ... ... gathering to comfort you .
to the parents of the missing man ... ... i can only say no effort will be spared ... ... to find this brave man and bring him home .
we've just received this photograph of schumann in captivity ... ... held by a dissident group of albanian terrorists .
now , i don't know how many of you are familiar with morse code ... ... but could you bring the camera closer and here , please?
you'll see his sweater is worn .
it has been unraveled in places .
and those places form dashes and dots ... ... and those dots spell out a message in morse code .
that message is , " courage , mom .
courage , mom .
he got the message through .
courage , mom .
not bad for government work .
having a good time?
haven't had this much fun since live tv .
to the men and women of unit 303 ... ... to my fellow citizens , i say , " courage , mom .
i have informed the albanian government that we will not rest ... ... until the safe return of sergeant schumann .
i'm told his unit mates gave him the nickname " old shoe .
wasn't there a folk song called " old shoe?
do you remember that?
something like ...
i don't know .
i can vaguely remember it .
do you know what i'm talking about?
old shoe .
thank you , ladies and gentlemen .
good night and god bless .
trump that , senator neal , you howdy doody looking vontz .
as we reported earlier , u. s. serviceman willie schumann ... ... remains missing behind enemy lines ...
it's all thinking ahead .
that's what producing is .
it's like being a plumber .
yes .
it's like being a plumber .
do your job right , nobody should notice .
when you fuck up , everything gets full of shit . ... symbol of the military team ... ... sergeant william schumann , the " old shoe .
what do you say , we line up the president for the peace prize?
our job ends on election day .
yes .
but , come on .
just for the symmetry of the thing?
that's right .
if kissinger can win the peace prize ... ... i wouldn't be surprised to wake up and find out i'd won the preakness .
well , yes , but our guy did bring peace .

i say , don't go changing horses in midstream .

for an economy you can rely on ...
fucking amateurs .
pity of it is , two more days , and we bring it all back home .
knock wood .
and who's gonna know?
who's gonna know what we did?
pride of a job well done , stan .
it's the pride of a job well done , but it's more that , stanley .

is that the thing?
indeed it is .

of course he's gonna need a little help .

i'm gonna need an ambulance .

produce this schumann .
produce him , i say ... ... or , and i don't hesitate to say this ... ... rank him as just another in a series of broken promises .

hell of a show , stan .

it's just producing .
that's what it is .
you know , there's no academy award for producing .
you're kidding .
there's no academy award for producing .
where do movies come from if nobody produces them , connie?
they come from people like you .
well , you know .
you just got to take the bitter with the better .
job's almost done .
knock on wood .
we did a good job .
that's our reward .
you know , you can't save the world .
all you can do is try .
ain't that the truth?
and , as we said , the president ... ... thrust of the albanian episode to put him over the top .
yes .
you could say that , shirley , but it's just simply just not true .
what would be true , then?
well , you said it yourself earlier , if i may rephrase ... ... that the success of the president in the polls
as of today , 89 % favorable .
89 % favorable ... ... is based not on the events , which of course we cannot control ... ... but on the spin given to those events .
what's the lesson here , connie?
never give up .
never give up .
you're right .
you're right .
the show must go on .
proud traditions .
i am prouder of this than anything i ever did in my life .
you should be , stan .

you gave me a good opportunity .
thank you .
thank you .
and as we said , the president , a surefire winner ... ... and the campaign , many said , that put him there .
another great race today , johnny .
who are you going to ride in the stakes?
eddie , like my daddy always used to say
the message is irrelevant .
the main element here we have to deal with ... ... is the fact that fear is what's driving a lot of people .
ok?
yes .
commercials .
commercials .
commercials .
commercials .
the president is a product .
yes , the president is a product .
he's the president of the united states of america .

it's tempting , but i got to answer to a higher calling .
art .
money?
money?
you think i did this for money?
i did this for credit .

they called it " a thrill ride for the ages ... " ... but they didn't mention the producer .

now i'm going to stand here ... ... and let some limp dick film school pansy ... ... take the credit?
what?
you can't do it .
don't you tell me that !
don't you ever tell me that !
i am the producer of this show !
if i didn't step up , you're nowhere !
i put this together out of spit and polish !
look at that .
that is a complete fucking fraud ... ... and it looks 100 % real .
it's the best work i've ever done in my life ... ... because it's so honest .
they told me i couldn't remake moby dick ... ... from the point of view of the whale . $450 million domestic .
