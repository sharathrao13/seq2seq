when you wish upon a star
makes no difference who you are
anything your heart desires
will come to you
if your heart is in your dream
no request is too extreme
when you wish upon a star
as dreamers do
fate is kind
she brings to those who love
the sweet fulfillment of
their secret longing
like a bolt out of the blue
fate steps in and sees you through
when you wish upon a star
your dreams
come true
pretty , huh?
i'll bet a lot of you folks don't believe that , about a wish coming true , do you?
well , i didn't either .
of course , i'm just a cricket singing my way from hearth to hearth , but ... let me tell you what made me change my mind .
one night a long time ... ahem .
pardon me .
wait'll i fix this thing .
there .
one night a long time ago ... my travels took me to a quaint little village .
it was a beautiful night .
the stars were shining like diamonds ... high above the roofs of that sleepy old town .
pretty as a picture .
as i wandered along the crooked streets , there wasn't a soul to be seen .
the only sign of life was a lighted window ... in the shop of a wood carver named ...
geppetto .
so i hopped over ...
and looked in .
it was a shame to see a nice cheerful fire like that going to waste .
so what do i do?
i go in !
i looked around .
of course , being in a strange place like that ,
i didn't know what to expect .
a cricket can't be too careful , you know .
soon as i saw there was no one about , i made myself at home .
as i stood there warming my ... myself , i took a look around .
well , sir , you never saw such a place .
the most fantastic clocks you ever laid your eyes on , and all carved out of wood .
and cute little music boxes , each one a work of art .
and shelf after shelf of toys and ...
and then something else caught my eye .
a puppet !
you know , one of those marionette things , all strings and joints .
cute little fellow .
ding , ding .
going up?
good piece of wood too .
well , now ,
it won't take much longer .
meow .
just a little more paint and he's all finished .
i think he'll be all right .
don't you , figaro?
purr .
ahh !
beg pardon .
see?
that makes a big difference .
ver r r y good .
very , very good .
well , you can't please everybody .
now i have just the name for you .
pinocchio !
do you like it , figaro?
no?
you do , don't you , cleo?
well , we'll leave it to little woodenhead .
you like it?
that settles it !
pinocchio it is !
come on , now , we'll try you out .
music , professor !
hey !
ouch , ouch !
take it easy there !
oh , break it up , will you?
whew !
lotta down beats in there .
little woodenhead go play your part
bring a little joy to every heart
little do you know and yet it's true
that i'm mighty proud of you
little wooden feet and best of all
little wooden seat in case you fall
oh ho !
how graceful !
my little woodenhead
cleo , meet pinocchio .
say , " how do you do?
say hello to figaro .
oops !
oh ho ho !
up to mischief already .
you see what happens?
boo !
up we go !
ah , you're a cute little fellow .
meow .
purr , purr .
and that smile !
you know , i ...
meow !
you rascal !
jealous , huh?
you know , pinocchio ,
i think figaro is jealous of you .
don't worry , figaro .
i sti ...
uh oh .
quack , quack .
quack , quack .
buzz , buzz .
buzz , buzz .
cuckoo , cuckoo .
cuckoo , cuckoo .
gobble , gobble .
gobble , gobble .
peep , peep .
peep , peep .
hiccup , hiccup , hiccup , hiccup .
waa !
waa !
waa !
waa !
i wonder what time it is .
it's getting late .
come now .
we go to bed .
good night , pinocchio .
little funny face .
good night , cleo , my little water baby .
figaro?
you say good night too .
go on !
now go to sleep , my little mermaid .
good night .
oh hum .
this is my idea of comfort .
solid comfort .
look at him , figaro .
he almost looks alive !
wouldn't it be nice if he was a real boy?
oh , well .
come on .
we go to sleep .
ah , figaro .
i forgot to open the window .
oh , figaro !
look , look , the wishing star !
star light , star bright , first star i see tonight .
i wish i may , i wish i might , have the wish i make tonight .
figaro , you know what i wished?
i wished that my little pinocchio ... might be a real boy !
wouldn't that be nice?
just think .
a real boy .
a very lovely thought , but not at all practical .
a real ... boy .
quiet !
after all , enough's enough .
now what's up?
hey , what's going on here?
as i live and breathe , a fairy !
mm mmm !
good geppetto , you have given so much happiness to others .
you deserve to have your wish come true .
little puppet made of pine , wake .
the gift of life is thine .
whew !
what they can't do these days .
i can move !
i can talk !
i can walk !
yes , pinocchio , i've given you life .
why?
because tonight geppetto wished for a real boy .
am i a real boy?
no , pinocchio .
to make geppetto's wish come true ...
will be entirely up to you .
up to me?
prove yourself brave , truthful and unselfish ,
and someday you will be a real boy .
a real boy !
that won't be easy .
you must learn to choose between right and wrong .
right ... and wrong?
but how will i know?
how'll he know !
your conscience will tell you .
what are conscience?
what are conscience !
i'll tell ya !
a conscience is that still , small voice people won't listen to .
that's just the trouble with the world today .
are you my conscience?
who , me?
would you like to be pinocchio's conscience?
well ... uh , i , i ...
uh huh .
very well !
what is your name?
oh , cricket's the name .
jiminy cricket .
kneel , mr. cricket .
huh?
no tricks now .
i dub you pinocchio's conscience .
lord high keeper of the knowledge of right and wrong , counselor in moments of temptation ... and guide along the straight and narrow path .
arise , sir jiminy cricket .
well !
ho ho ho !
my , my !
mmm !
say , that's pretty swell .
gee ... thanks !
but ... don't i get a badge or somethin '?
we'll see .
you mean , maybe i will?
i shouldn't wonder .
make it a gold one?
maybe .
now remember , pinocchio , be a good boy .
and always let your conscience be your guide .
good bye , milady .
good bye .
not bad , says i.
oh , yeah !
ho ho ho !
almost forgot about you .
well , pinoke , maybe you and i had better have a little heart to heart talk .
why?
well , you want to be a real boy , don't you?
uh huh .
all right , sit down , son .
now , you see ,
the world is full of temptations .
temptations?
yep !
temptations .
they're the wrong things that seem right at the time , but ... even though the right things may seem wrong sometimes , sometimes the wrong things , [ chuckle ]
may be right at the wrong time , or ... visa versa .
ahem .
understand?
uh uh .
but i'm gonna do right !
attaboy , pinoke , and i'm gonna help ya !
and anytime you need me , you know , just whistle ...
like this .
like this?
no , no .
try it again , pinoke .
like this?
no , son .
now listen !
that's it !
come on , now .
let's sing it !
when you get in trouble and you don't know right from wrong
give a little whistle [ whistle ]
give a little whistle [ whistle ]
when you meet temptation and the urge is very strong
give a little whistle give a little whistle
not just a little squeak pucker up and blow
and if your whistle's weak , yell jiminy cricket?
right !
take the straight and narrow path
and if you start to slide give a little whistle
give a little whistle
and always let your conscience be your guide
ooh , ooh , ooh , ooh
take the straight and narrow path
and if you start to slide
give a little whistle yoo hoo .
give a little whistle woo hoo !
and always let your conscience be your guide
and always let your conscience be your guide
