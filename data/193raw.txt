luther , how we doin '?
not there yet , ethan .
i'll give you the word .
billy , ready to go?
okay , package away in five
i'm not ready .
the louvers aren't moving .
come on , luther !
we gotta go !
wait , there's a glitch in the access code .
luther , we're out of time .
on the count .
please , baby , open up , open up .
five , four , come on ! three , two , one !
i'm going now !
ethan , wait !
twenty five , twenty four , twenty three , twenty two , twenty one , twenty .
ethan , you've got 19 seconds to clear the cable .
okay , retracting cable !
come on !
nine , eight , seven , six , five , four , three , two
cable's clear !
transponder activated .
reading package and cable clear .
he'll breach the lab at the only possible time , whether you break in from the ground or the roof .
it's 2300 hours , one minute ... when the air filtration generators will cover the sound of hunt's break in ... and the rotating guards make the building vulnerable ... to our break in from below .
ethan , the generator's about to go active .
just a friendly reminder .
we'll be out of contact for eight minutes .
i'm betting hunt will destroy chimera ... rather than attempt to preserve any part of it .
he'll have to do it in two places .
first , the incubation room where the growth vials are kept .
and finally , in the inoculation chamber ... holding the last remaining chimera virus in three injection guns .
he won't be allowed to destroy the virus in those guns .
what's this?
you're on time , for once?
not exactly , sport .
john c. mccloy .
billy , i think we've got a problem .
nyah's on the wing up early .
billy , do you copy?
yeah , i got you , luther .
sorry , exactly where is she?
in the building .
say again , mate .
sounds like you're saying she's in the building .
i am .
she is .
uh , well , then she's not likely to be alone , is she , mate?
she's in the elevator , headed towards ethan .
how many of them?
i can't get through to ethan , not till the generators go .
yeah , well , when's that?
not for another ... five and a half minutes .
chimera in vitro ph and temperature level ... outside optimal range .
chimera in vitro ph and temperature level ... outside optimal range .
chimera working seed stock ph at critical level .
alert .
chimera stock life threatened .
alert .
chimera stock life terminated .
come on , ethan .
come on .
subject is contaminant free .
zero contaminant factor .
come on , come on , come on , come on .
luther , what the hell can we do?
what can we do?
hope he kills all the bugs before the yellow dot gets to the red one .
however we travel ,
i must arrive at my destination within 20 hours of departure .
how was i to know that he needed to be treated ... with bellerophon within 20 hours?
get him .
how much longer before you can reach him?
we've got 29 seconds before the generators turn off , then ethan will be back on line .
ahh !
luther !
luther !
hold your fire !
hold your fire , damn it !
well , hunt ... how've you been?
fighting a bit of a cold .
aww .
you know , that was the hardest part of having to portray you grinning like an idiot every 15 minutes .
i would've thought the hardest part was curbing that pressing need of yours ... to get your gun off .
you were in such a hurry to knock off that 747 ... you never figured out where chimera really was .
i knew where it was .
oh .
then you knew the only way nekhorvich could smuggle the live virus ... is by injecting himself and using his own bloodstream as a petridish .
you knew that ... while you were knocking him off , destroying the very thing you came for .
stop !
put a sock in it !
hit that bloody gun , and you'll spray the virus all over the place !
there it is , guys .
the last of it .
what was the top bid?
why?
you gonna make me a better offer?
than $$37 million?
not really .
oh !
somebody has been slipping you our mail .
come on out here , you bad girl .
sean , she doesn't belong here .
let her go .
she wouldn't be here ... if it wasn't for you , hunt .
from this moment , you are responsible for what happens to her .
and if you're looking out for her well being ,
i suggest you advise her to pick up the injection gun and bring it to me .
ball's in your court , hunt .
nyah's in the building .
do you copy?
thank you .
how do you know he won't shoot you the minute he's got it?
please .
one can't hold nyah responsible for her actions .
you know women , mate .
like monkeys they are .
won't let go of one branch till they get a grip on the next !
get it , nyah .
i'll cover you .
i am waiting .
things haven't exactly worked out the way you thought they would , ethan .
sorry .
you bitch !
you're not gonna shoot me , sean .
not this bitch .
'cause she's worth $$37 million .
what did you think you were doing?
i wasn't thinking !
just trying to stop you from getting hurt , that's all !
you who don't have a conscience .
i guess i lied .
you can't get us both out of here , can you?
i'm infected with chimera .
you know you don't have a choice .
just do it .
do it now !
we've got 19 hours and 58 minutes !
i'll get bellerophon into your system before then !
just stay alive !
i'm not going to lose you !
feel like pleading for your life?
well , then , how about dying ... so you can make me a lot of money?
in just a few hours time , you can be assured ... of going down in history as the typhoid mary of oz .
g'day .
there's not a chance of locating nyah until i can access the satellite .
and there's not a chance of doing that until i can get this computer fixed .
how much time does she have left?
not long .
but whatever happens , nyah will take care of nyah .
what do you mean?
unless we dose her with bellerophon ,
nyah will kill herself .
so first things first .
ethan , ambrose and his team have arrived ... over the bridge , and nyah's not with him , mate .
copy that .
you all right , mate? looks like pretty heavy security from here .
what's it look like from there?
risky .
simon?
simon !
stay here .
breached the structure at the 10 : 00 grating .
it's a dna match .
the blood's loaded with chimera .
and they certainly have bellerophon .
well , then you've got both the virus and the antivirus , which means i've got 30 million for you .
not exactly .
we don't want just your cash .
what do you want?
stock , mr. mccloy .
stock options , to be a little more precise .
cut her loose ... right in the center of town .
the more crowded the better .
ethan , just picked up an ambrose call .
nyah's been dropped off .
where is she?
somewhere in sydney .
somewhere in sydney?
care to harden the target?
i can't until ...
i can get the gps up on our computer .
it's down .
the clock is ticking .
how quickly can you manufacture more of the antivirus?
no time at all , once i've got it .
good .
biocyte stock is just a few weeks away from going through the roof .
what are you talking about?
an outbreak of chimera .
where?
downtown sydney , for a start .
you create the supply , mr. mccloy .
we've just created the demand .
three million people in sydney ... and 17 million people in australia ... are going to need bellerophon within the next few days , not to mention the rest of the world .
now , this is how it's going to work .
wallis , the shares outstanding are?
93 . 4 million .
which means , mr. mccloy , we need to get our hands on 480, 000 options .
we'll borrow your 30 million to buy those options .
your stock has never sold above $31 a share .
when your stock goes north of 200 , which it will , those options will be worth billions , and i will own 51 % of biocyte .
this is outrageous .
i will not let you take control of my company .
sit down .
you'll be a billionaire .
it's better than being broke .
i have terrorists and ... other pharmaceutical companies standing in line .
the ball's in your court , mr. mccloy .
run that bastard down .
we're running short on time , mr. mccloy .
we have got to conclude our business .
yes .
start the transfer .
follow it ... and let me know .
uh !
raise your hands very slowly .
sure you want me to do this?
raise your hands very slowly .
ethan , ethan , do you copy?
do you copy?
keep it going !
sean , this rat's reached the end of the maze .
is he alive?
yeah , more or less .
bring him to me .
go !
sean , transfer completed .
well done , stamp .
well done .
stop mumbling !
i'm afraid he's got no choice .
i believe i broke his jaw .
stamp , i'm impressed .
right .
we don't have a lot of time , hunt .
whatever you got to say , say it now .
how about giving us a big smile?
no?
what are you doing?
get down on your knees .
now , this is what's known ... as getting your gun off .
there he is !
ethan !
just back off and pin point your positions !
luther , clear the bridge for me !
hunt's heading for the bridge , coming in at 12 : 00 high .
oh , i'm mad now .
ha ha !
you all right , mate?
that punk put a hole in my versace !
ethan , the computer's up .
i've got nyah .
she's moved out of the city .
she's on the north head bluff approaching the cliffs .
but i can't get a visual .
copy !
she's only got a little time left !
track ahead and pick her up !
i can't get a good shot .
ethan , we won't be able to cover you !
my earpiece is failing !
you've got me on gps !
bring her to me !
billy , north head bluff .
haul ass .
get out there and keep firing !
i can't see anything !
slow down , mate !
slow down !
range is 2k .
ahhh !
go ahead .
use it , hunt .
it's not a bad way to go .
it's a lot better than the way that bitch is gonna die .
hey , there she is !
hunt !
you should've killed me .
miss hall's blood , it appears , has absolutely no elements of the chimera virus , not even antibodies .
yes .
i gathered as much .
but you were under specific instructions , mr. hunt , to bring back a living sample of the chimera virus .
i'd be very interested to know how , after you managed this recovery , it subsequently got destroyed .
by fire .
it's the best way , really .
oh .
well , mr. hunt , as for miss hall , in light of her efforts , her criminal record will certainly be expunged .
wiped out .
i'm assuming you approve .
i do .
yeah .
where is she now , by the way?
any idea?
i don't know .
not exactly .
so , what are your plans?
i don't know .
uh , some sort of vacation .
i'll let you know where i'm going .
you don't have to do that .
it wouldn't be a vacation if you did .
let's get lost .
