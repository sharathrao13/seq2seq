the day i left home my mother said to me
son , come here
she caressed my hair looked me in the eye
and said
wherever you go i follow
in my thoughts wherever you are
in my prayers i'll ask god
to light your way
i know she never understood my reasons for parting
but she knows when sons grow up they become birds and want to fly
i'd really like to have stayed but my fate decided otherwise
my mother watched in the doorway blessing me and crying as i left
that day my mother told me of the ways of the world
as if she knew each step along the way
without ever leaving my father's side in that small town
she told me son , may god be with you
for this whole world is yours
i know she never understood my reasons for parting
but she knew when sons grow up they become birds and want to fly
i'd really like to have stayed but my fate decided otherwise

it's the story of my life .
in these plain verses
my beauty , my love
for you i wish to sing
my suffering and pain
i'm like the whippoorwill
that sings so sadly
from the branch where it sits
with this guitar i truly sing and cry out
each lament is my yearning
i was born in those hills
in a lowly little shack
all full of holes
letting the moonlight shine in
when nightfall comes
hey , come here , kids !
i'll buy you lunch .
not even a letter .
that's just how it is , helena .
it takes a while .
i thought miranda said one week?
in these plain verses my beauty , my love
for i wish to sing my suffering and pain
i'm like the whippoorwill
that sings so sadly from the branch where it sits
with this guitar i truly sing and cry out
each lament is my yearning
i was born in those hills
in a lowly little shack
all full of holes
letting the moonlight shine in
beautiful !
perfect !
when nightfall comes go get dressed for the show .
the birds in the bush start making noise
downstairs in an hour , you hear emival?
look , emival .
when are we going back home?

he's upstairs getting ready .
emival's always late !
unbearable !

you have to listen to me !
you're not my father !
it's been four months , francisco !

i want my two boys !
dad !
