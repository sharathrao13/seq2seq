going somewhere , solo?
it's too late .
you should have paid him when you had the chance .
jabba's put a price on your head so large ... every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you .
i'm lucky i found you first .
if you give it to me , i might forget i found you .
jabba's through with you .
he has no time for smugglers ... who drop their shipments at the first sign of an imperial cruiser .
you can tell that to jabba .
he may only take your ship .
that's the idea .
i've been looking forward to this for a long time .
solo !
come out of there , solo !
have you now .
han , my boy , you disappoint me .
why haven't you paid me ... and why did you fry poor greedo?
han , i can't make exceptions .
what if everyone who smuggled for me ... dropped their cargo at the first sign ... of an imperial starship?
it's not good business .
han , my boy , you're the best .
so , for an extra 20 % ...
okay , 15 % .
but if you fail me again ...
i'll put a price on your head so big ... you won't be able to go near a civilized system .
come on !
