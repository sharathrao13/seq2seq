information " ... the very nature of the word is beginning to change .
the world is shrinking .
borders are collapsing ... cultures are growing closer and closer day by day .
information is the new unexplored frontier .
and in the forefront of this new age is , of course ... the internet .
are you sure this is a big story?
scoop , " joaquim .
the proper term is scoop .
and , yeah , i'm sure .
cute secretaries don't lie .
well ...
hank , you're my hero .
hey , where are you going?
press .
do you have an appointment?
there's a coup going on in that boardroom .
that's news .
you need an appointment to get in .
7tv , hank robinson , right there .
okay , rock and roll .
public broadcasting?
is that a problem?
take it easy , hank .
no , take it easy?
i'm not going to take it easy .
i don't need this guy keeping me out of here ... because he doesn't like the company i'm working for .
how come he waltzes through?
seor aribau has the exclusive rights to all nova communications .
the number of people who get their news from the internet ... as opposed to , you know , tv or newspapers ... grows by 1 million worldwide each year .
one million .
just follow my lead , and it'll be fine , okay?
good morning , christina , you look beautiful .
can i see the boss?
just a minute , please .
the conclusion is obvious .
he who controls the internet ... controls information .
in the last three years , nova communications ... have carved a widening niche in the telecommunications market .
well , i believe it's time we expanded .
did you call the press , seor pla?
no , i did not .
if you think something newsworthy is going to happen today ... you are very much mistaken .
you may be our main stockholder , but i'm still president of this company .
i direct policy .
nothing will change that .
hank robinson reporting from barcelona .
i am standing in front of the headquarters of nova ... the fastest growing telecommunications company in spain .
today , majority shareholder manuel pla is challenging nova president sert ... inside the boardroom , while i stand out here in the parking lot .
come on , let's go again .
take two .
what's this?
this is my offer , seor sert .
quite generous , i think .
you're trying to buy me out?
we get a two shot and we go to lunch , okay?
everybody down !
on the floor .
now !
don't move !
oh , no !
what the hell is that?
what the hell is going on here?
what's the meaning of this?
oh , my god !
jesus christ !
let's go .
go?
go where?
in there , where the story is .
you know what else is in there?
someone with a gun .
give me the camera .
no !
fine .
nothing is worth dying for , man .
call the police , i'm going in .
hank .
who are you people?
we are anarchy now .
your company spreads lies to confuse innocent people .
gunfire at the nova offices .
always make sure there's film in the camera .
you support the capitalist pigs .
this is your reward .
all of you , get out of here !
come on , run !
run !
tell everyone the truth .
boss !
listen , call veronica .
tell her i've got footage of sert's murder .
acts of terror have become so commonplace in our age ... that we run the risk of becoming used to their images ... to becoming desensitised to them .
the day that these shocking , horrific images fail to appal us ... is the day that we begin to lose some of our humanity .
let's let these images speak for themselves .
i , for one , will not soon forget them .
my favourite part's coming up .
this is hank robinson reporting ... with a 7tv news exclusive .
and we're out .
pure genius .
it helps to have the hottest producer in town .
all the major wires called .
they want to licence your video .
bleed them dry .
and our ratings are climbing .
we got 20 share tonight .
thousands of people tuned in .
how does it feel being a star?
twenty share?
speaking as your producer , i'm thrilled .
speaking as your girlfriend ... don't ever risk your life like that again .
with great risks come great rewards .
what you did was the most inspiring thing i've ever seen .
veronica .
that tape ...
the thing is ...
i just  proved to the world ... what i've always known .
you're the real deal , hank .
i love you .
and i don't want to lose you .
i love you , too .
i have to rinse .
yes , i understand all that , but just get him for me .
at 3 : 00 , you're interviewing cardinal rosselli .
i thought he never meets the press .
he agreed to talk to you .
this is a real scoop .
ronnie .
i'm getting audio interference on camera 2 .
interference?
either god's talking to us ... or it's someone's cell phone .
his polls are rather low .
excuse me , sir .
can't you see the sign?
i'm most terribly sorry .
very thoughtless of me .
nicola , i'll have to call you back .
i'm archibald mcgovern .
and you are veronica nadal .
top of your class of the barcelona school of journalism .
1999?
'98 , actually .
i'm here to see mr. robinson .
so , this is 7tv .
well , it's quaint .
is your studio fully soundproof?
of course .
some of the equipment has been here since the '60s .
that's all , it needs to be replaced .
a journalist of mr. robinson's stature deserves better .
we are only a local station , we take what we can get .
jordi , what the hell are you doing?
sorry , miss nadal .
you can start by replacing him .
excuse me .
hank robinson?
archie mcgovern , owner
and ceo of vision television news .
pleasure , sir .
pleasure to meet you .
i'm sorry , this will have to wait .
hank goes on in 10 minutes .
have you met veronica , my producer?
oh , yes , indeed .
and i will only take five .
you have to forgive her .
she's a little protective .
and rightly so .
you're her gold mine .
so that's mcgovern .
seems like a nice guy .
yeah , that's just what they said about hitler .
okay .
let's get hank's sound levels up .
weil , we did start 7tv together .
shall we?
it's kind of our baby .
scrimping and scavenging for every cent ... hunting down stories , hoping and praying for the exclusive ... that would put you on the map .
yes , i know that life .
i know it very well .
so tell me , hank , how many viewers does 7tv get a week?
70, 000?
100, 000?
55, 000 , sir .
vision tv ... is watched by 10 million people every night , and growing .
i know , sir .
what can i do for you?
mr. robinson , i'm here on a rather serious matter .
the late carlos aribau .
did you know that he worked for me?
yes , he was a wonderful reporter .
he'll be missed .
on the morning of the nova attack , i sent carlos to interview seor sert ... and then , your story came to my attention .
mr. robinson , you represent ...
well , hank , you represent everything ... that vision tv has come to stand for .
and i would like you to join our family .
i beg your pardon?
that's right , hank , your gravy train has come in .
i'm going to have to talk to someone about that .
i understand .
i'm sure she will realise what a grand opportunity this is for you .
bring her along if you like .
thank you , sir .
of course he wants to hire you .
guys like mcgovern are afraid of guys like you .
you report the story .
mcgovern , he reports the official story .
he gets us into 10 million households .
yeah , but at what price?
my father worked for 10 years before the networks called ... and when they did , he jumped at it .
hank , we are so close to achieving everything we wanted .
don't throw away our independence .
it's a good thing .
this is a good thing .
you made a decision like that without me?
i'm your partner , i'm your girlfriend .
they promised to hire you .
i already have everything i've ever wanted .
at least , i thought i did .
veronica , please sit down .
women .
let me buy you a drink .
no , i got to go .
i think you're doing the right thing .
vision tv , man .
that's a big time .
yeah .
need a cameraman?
you know what?
i'll bet they probably do .
i'll ask them , all right?
you do that .
hank .
yeah?
my camcorder ... the one you filmed your nova story with .
it wasn't loaded .
sure it was .
no , it wasn't .
i number all my tapes .
it was empty .
what's your point?
none of my business how you got the story .
just share the wealth , you know?
i'm a talented guy , and i'm shooting porn to make ends meet .
it's a fucking crime .
are you blackmailing me?
no , i would never do that .
we're friends , right?
yeah .
friends do friends favours .
sure they do .
so , good karma .
we understand each other .
oh , yeah .
we understand each other .
terrific .
i'll be seeing you , hank .
hey , hombre , that's my beer .
hey , hank !
here's to us .
partners forever !
okay .
i can't get this all done .
no , you're not listening to me .
the founding of iran by howard robinson .
your father's book was required reading in class .
barcelona school of journalism .
i'm marisa perez .
i'm your assistant .
this is my first job .
hello , marisa .
it's okay .
it's my first time having an assistant .
miss markham is waiting for you in the newsroom .
of course , nicola markham .
yeah , she's our news director .
all right , the chinese plan to have a man on the moon by the end of the year .
right , if their entire population stands on each other's shoulders .
you're late .
sorry , i didn't realise there was a meeting .
news happens every day , robinson , and every day we report it .
that's why we are called a news service .
eduardo , the chinese astronaut is yours , a present from me .
and next , in africa , alds epidemic is at an all time high .
katrina , you run with that .
and in local news , barcelona is once again in the champion's league .
make it the lead story .
okay , what are you waiting for?
impress me .
not so fast , robinson .
call me hank .
robinson , how the hell did you end up in spain?
i thought there were more career opportunities in europe .
meaning you couldn't cut it stateside .
if you want to last here , you will follow instructions , claro?
claro .
good .
after assuming control of nova ...
manuel pla set his sights on his main rival , intertel .
if pla succeeds in purchasing intertel ... he will have a virtual monopoly on the telecommunications market .
first spain , then europe .
precisely .
i want you to interview eloy agustin , the head of intertel .
find out why he won't sell , and what he intends to do about it .
questions?
no , ma'am .
good .
i was in tehran with your father during the revolution .
you look a lot like him .
i hope i'm half the reporter he was .
careful what you wish for .
seor agustin , you're dealing with a hostile takeover bid from nova .
how are you planning to deal with the threat?
i have faith in the loyalty of my stockholders .
they realise nova is trying to force everyone out of business .
that may be , but we deal in a free market society .
can you really fault them their success?
think of a world in which one company provided every service .
without competition , there is no need to maintain quality , or accountability .
information should belong to everyone .
the internet should be free .
unregulated .
thank you , sir .
this is hank robinson reporting from intertel .
we have the edit suite booked for noon ... so with any luck , we should be done tomorrow afternoon .
are you enjoying your new job?
i am , yes .
your predecessor , carlos aribau , was a friend of mine .
was he?
did you know him?
our paths crossed briefly .
listen , i'd love to chat , but i must run .
thank you .
of course .
good luck .
i hope this business doesn't victimise you the way it did carlos .
what do you mean?
you know what it's like ... trying to weed out the liars from the honest men .
in the end , carlos trusted no one .
not even his best friends .
hello .
did i wake you?
who's this?
you've got 45 minutes .
time for a piss and a shower .
hurry up .
i'm not going anywhere until you tell me your name .
nova , hank .
the anarchist attack , remember?
you didn't sit on your ass .
you went out there and got the story .
what do you want?
the gothic knights bar , robinson .
45 minutes .
and , hey , make sure there's film in the camera this time , okay?
nothing personal .
you've seen too much .
seor agustin ... wants you dead .
did you confront agustin?
of course .
he got uptight ... claimed his private life was nobody's business .
sounds like he doesn't know this girl is a killer .
he knows .
he's hiding it .
conjecture .
it all fits .
who's agustin's biggest rival?
nova .
who did the terrorists attack?
nova .
who benefits?
agustin .
talk about aggressive business practices .
it's still all conjecture .
we operate on facts .
i saw her at nova's office .
i saw her face .
you're a reporter .
your word isn't proof .
you need corroboration .
nicola may be a bit overzealous at times , but she has a point .
yes .
looking forward to seeing it .
you'll have to excuse me .
thank you for your time .
mr. robinson?
manuel pla .
i recognise you from tv .
and the lovely ...
marisa perez .
marisa is my assistant .
pleasure .
congratulations .
your company's fortunes have really turned around .
well , in part thanks to mr. robinson .
he made us famous .
and if we succeed on acquiring intertel ...
enjoy yourselves .
thank you .
would you like a drink?
sure .
scotch is great , thanks .
hi .
how are things?
fine .
i mean , sure , we're in a ratings slump right now ... but we'll turn it around .
i've met a few young reporters with a lot of potential .
you look beautiful .
so , that's your date?
marisa?
yes , she's my intern .
is that what they call it now?
i miss you .
a lot .
can we get together?
talk?
i've left some of my things at your place .
well , come on by .
anytime .
i've got a story to cover .
hey , i know you .
tv .
it must have been scary .
what's that?
alone , filming the anarchists .
they weren't just angry young kids with cap guns .
top of the line uzis , classic commando assault .
i'd say they had training , financing , backing .
someone developed anarchists now .
and that someone is running the show .
i'm sorry , i didn't get your name .
i'm a cop .
brechner , interpol .
on duty?
always , keeping an eye on things .
don't want a repeat of the nova incident , do we?
agent brechner , you mind if i ask you a few questions?
you on duty?
always .
why not?
you identified any of the anarchists?
we have our suspicions .
one of them is a woman .
you know her name?
do you?
i have a story .
my bosses won't let me run it until i get corroboration .
if i show you a picture , can you confirm it?
you can't name me .
anonymous source .
what do you need?
her name is leila krtolica .
anarchy now's aim is to create chaos ... to destabilise governments , eventually create a new world order .
businesses represent capitalism to them , their most hated enemy .
already this year they've claimed 28 victims .
leila made interpol's most wanted in june .
now she's in spain .
but what's her connection to agustin?
terrorists need funding .
it's hard to blow up bombs on an empty stomach .
you tell me eloy agustin is a sponsor of terrorism?
according to my interpol source .
they've been watching him for years .
looks like you've got your corroboration , nicola .
okay , robinson .
impress me .
what is the connection between anarchy now operative leila krtolica ... and eloy agustin of intertel?
recently , krtolica assassinated the president of nova ...
agustin's greatest rival .
coincidence?
seor agustin has denied any connection with any terrorist group ... and maintains he is the victim of a frame up .
cut .
thoughts?
not bad .
careful .
you don't want to hurt yourself praising .
you did your job .
what do you want , a cookie?
we'll lead with it tonight .
happy?
jesus , veronica , i thought you were looking for ...
so what are you doing here?
i told you , i left some things behind .
you weren't home .
i still have my key .
which reminds me .
so long , hank .
i'm sorry .
i'm just ...
sorry , i'm a little high strung lately .
i saw your report tonight .
you watch vision tv?
only when you're on .
and?
you did good .
i'm happy for you .
thanks .
careful , hank .
i am humbled by the trust i've been given in being appointed nova's new ceo .
i vow to lead nova and its new acquisitions ... with integrity and vision , into a prosperous future .
in the furore following the allegations surrounding eloy agustin last week ...
intertel stockholders voted unanimously to sell their company to manuel pla .
seor agustin , meanwhile ... is under investigation by the chief magistrate's office .
this is hank robinson with vision tv signing off .
didn't your father ever teach you to keep your powder dry?
your story on agustin caused quite a stir .
i've had the chief magistrate on the line all morning .
just the result of good journalism , i guess , sir .
yes .
free publicity is priceless .
actually , i was thinking more about the social value .
we exposed killers .
ever wonder what a limey like me was doing in spain?
i love it .
still virgin territory , pure .
it's waiting to be developed .
the rest of europe is so cynical .
it's too knowing .
and together we going to make this city the centre for world news .
and i have faith in you .
we're onto something wonderful .
you can't learn to be a journalist from a book .
didn't they teach you anything at school?
yes .
we had a saying .
believe nothing of what you hear , and half of what you see .
that's a good motto .
hello?
yes , he is .
hold , please .
you've got a call on line 1 .
thank you .
hello .
good morning , partner .
caught your piece last night .
good job .
you going to give me your name this time?
call me crusader .
okay , crusader ... how did you know that agustin was sponsoring terrorism?
a magician never explains his tricks .
listen ... why me?
you're a rising star , hank .
you could go far .
i look forward to working with you for a very long time .
listen , how do i get a hold of you if i need you?
you were handed the story on a silver platter .
what are you complaining about?
i don't trust him , or like him .
you're beginning to sound like carlos aribau .
he thought his sources were cooking up stories .
what?
okay , i know what this is about : fear of success .
you're on the verge of surpassing your father ...
and the thought of it scares you .
bullshit .
just do your job !
here , another early story by carlos aribau .
anything interesting?
the usual .
local news , some crimes , some human interests .
you're a walking encyclopaedia , marisa .
listen ... how did aribau make it big?
i heard , out of nowhere , he got a lead .
something really big .
out of nowhere?
aribau had a secret source .
he never revealed who it was .
probably never knew .
after that big story that make him famous ... he was offered a job at vision tv , and the rest is history .
yeah , what was it?
that first big job?
industrial espionage .
some telecommunications companies has been accused of violating antitrust laws .
aribau would champion their cause and prove their innocence .
i was in high school , but i remember it was a big deal at the time .
manuel pla .
manuel pla would have been ruined , but aribau saved him .
the attack on nova , agustin's downfall .
over and over ...
pla benefited .
seor agustin?
seor agustin , we need to talk .
this is my home .
for 20 years !
i founded this company , and you ...
you took it away !
we were set up .
the both of us .
now , how did you meet the girl?
she came up to me , at the conference .
she was interested !
you are a man .
a woman that beautiful is interested in you , do you chase her away?
she said you wanted me dead .
and you believed it .
you , the great reporter !
i made a mistake .
i've been in business for a very long time .
this isn't over yet .
tell me what you know .
i asked my own questions , hired my own investigators .
leila is no anarchist .
she's no terrorist .
she's a cold , methodical killer .
she'll kill for you if the price is right .
are you telling me she's a mercenary?
the americans have a term for people like her .
they call them " security contractors .
who hired her?
manuel pla?
pla?
only a fool .
others behind him .
tell me who , seor agustin .
tell me .
god , it's them .
you brought them here !
seor agustin .
no !
you did all you could , mr. robinson .
you are a hero .
a hero would have saved him .
two assailants , one male , one female .
anything you can remember about them?
they had on , what do you call it?
the motorcycle mask .
i'm sorry .
one moment , please .
robinson .
don't say another word .
are you all right?
everything is fine .
yeah , everything is fine .
it's an important call .
it's an important call .
take your time .
listen , you son of a bitch , i am onto you .
you set up agustin .
don't be so melodramatic .
take a deep breath , calm down .
i am coming after you .
do you understand?
i don't exist , hank .
i'm a whisper , a breath on the other end of the line .
you set up agustin and you set me up .
you want me dead next?
i do hope it doesn't come to that .
i'm enjoying our relationship .
i have many , many more stories to tell you .
you can't manipulate me .
i'm not carlos aribau .
no , you're worse .
carlos never stepped on corpses to get a story .
mcgovern .
hank !
have you been in an accident?
listen to me .
agustin has been murdered .
he was strangled , and left hanging like a piece of meat .
murdered?
yes .
are you sure?
yes .
the police are calling it suicide .
what?
they found a note in his home , and there is an eyewitness .
what are you talking about?
that's insane .
i saw it , i was there .
all right , hank , i believe you ... but this is a news service .
you'll never get this past nicola without proof .
markham .
what time did it happen?
take it easy .
i got some bad news .
it's about agustin
feeling the unyielding hand of the law closing in on him ... and filled with remorse over his terrorist activity ... he lynched himself .
mcgovern scooped you .
but ... how did he know?
veronica?
okay , come on , everybody , run !
give me the fucking gun !
veronica , hi , it's me .
listen , can you meet me at the station?
so , hank , how are they treating you at vision tv?
good?
can't complain .
do you get overtime?
'cause we don't .
pedro .
did they give you an assistant?
yeah .
is she a babe?
pedro , the tape .
well , the tracking's screwed up .
was the camera damaged in any way?
well ...
we could dump both picture and sound on a computer ... and run a component program .
i've got just the thing for that .
the computer would digitally adjust the tracking .
it could clean up over 90 % of your sound and image .
how long is that going to take?
a day .
do it .
now , about your assistant?
okay , pedro .
thank you very much .
she's a slave master .
you're lucky you escaped when you did .
let me see if i understand .
the anarchy now attack ... it was all a ploy to disguise sert's murder .
they killed the president of nova so that manuel pla could take over ... and they framed agustin so pla could control intertel , right?
you were a witness .
you saw everything .
why didn't you expose them?
i didn't know what i had .
the first time i looked at the tape , it looked like a bunch of static .
what do you mean , " the first time "?
you shot this , didn't you?
whose tape is this?
carlos aribau's .
veronica , come on !
you robbed a dead man .
have you no shame?
the cops .
they examined the tape .
why didn't they catch this?
because i gave them a dub .
okay?
i kept the original .
i hid it .
they are going to crucify you .
why?
why did you do it?
because ...
all my life ...
i was living in my father's shadow .
all my life , i wanted to ...
i just ...
i just wanted to be the best , i just wanted to please .
it was there .
i saw it .
it was in my hand , i just took it .
i just did it .
okay?
i just took it .
i'm not this guy .
i'm not .
marisa .
good luck .
mr. mcgovern?
i bet you think you're quite the hotshot .
is there a problem , sir?
you , robinson , and your story .
your story on agustin put us at the top of the ratings .
congratulations .
i know someone who's going to be very happy with his christmas bonus this year .
wow .
thank you .
don't mention it .
you know , maybe as a follow up , you should do a story on nova .
you know , how manuel pla saved the company after the terrorist attack ... and turned its fortunes around .
fair and balanced , of course .
of course .
good .
an agent brechner from interpol called three times this morning .
the great game .
it's a term the british used during world war i for espionage .
they used people as game pieces and the world as a board .
a board game .
kind of like monopoly .
except in monopoly , the game pieces don't die .
listen , agustin was murdered .
i know .
there's a new player in the game .
leila's partner , paul wolf .
six feet tall , german , very professional .
listen , i've been getting calls , anonymous tips .
i'm thinking this wolf may be using me somehow .
what?
as a patsy , to cover up his crimes .
i don't know .
goddamn terrorists .
now they've joined the media .
why didn't you tell me sooner?
i'm a reporter .
i was hoping for a scoop .
don't be an idiot , robinson .
these people will eat you for breakfast .
if they contact you again ... please , let me know .
day or night .
consider me ...
a friend?
i was going to say " ally .
mr. robinson?
i'm sorry .
miss markham told me to give this to you .
she wanted me to hand it to you directly .
she sounded very mysterious .
what is it?
the police report on agustin's death .
who's winning?
would you get me another drink , please?
this is for vlps only .
how did you get in here?
the security guard was female .
she was susceptible to my charm .
big fan , huh?
he's going to foul .
yeah .
this fax .
one could draw some startling conclusions .
the forward centre is a star .
the police reports agustin's suicide ...
at five minutes to 1 1 : 00 in the morning ...
you're ruining my game . ... after mcgovern and i spoke .
mcgovern knew about this .
our boss is involved in this .
agustin never stood a chance .
i'm glad you're in this with me .
no , you can count me out .
these guys , they don't blush at much .
you scared?
if you were going to sit it out , why did you bait me?
you were hungry , out to get a name .
here's a story , now go fetch it .
so , i get my head blown off , and you sit behind your desk?
hank , when you've seen what i've seen , and you've lived what i've lived ... then you can judge me .
if i can help without exposing myself , i will .
but i don't intend on destroying myself over this .
it's not big enough .
see you at the water cooler , nicola .
hello , mr. robinson .
lmagine running into you here .
relax .
perhaps we
yeah , but the only problem was he didn't understand a word i was saying .
quite  so , what's the joke?
hank , good to see you .
nice to see you .
tell us what our star reporter has been up to .
what have i been up to?
well , i was shot , chased , nearly killed .
all in a day's work , you know .
how about you?
murder any competitors lately?
hank , why don't i get you a drink?
enjoy yourselves .
you've been reading too many spy novels , hank .
how did you know what was in agustin's police report before it was issued?
i have an amazingly good contact in the barcelona police force .
who?
hank !
a good reporter never reveals his sources .
you're lying .
am i?
truth is in the eye of the beholder .
truth is power .
the anarchist attack on nova .
orchestrated to remove an obstacle ... that stubborn old fool , sert ... and put manuel pla in charge .
framing agustin?
another obstacle removed .
now , pla has his finger in the internet and telecommunications pie .
why are you doing this?
the internet is dangerous .
it allows people to get information they cannot be trusted with .
it must be controlled ... step by step .
until , eventually , people like you are running the whole show .
i'm wondering what the chief magistrate is going to think about this .
why don't we ask him?
he's one of my guests .
he's right down there , see?
i believe you've already made his acquaintance .
of course , we will have to tell him the truth , the whole truth , and nothing but the truth ... including your pilfering of the aribau story .
oh , yes , i knew all along .
that's why i hired you .
well , we're the same , you and i.
unbound by petty moral concepts of good and evil ... we see what has to be done , and we do it .
men like us rule the world .
no .
yes .
we are governed only by our desires .
me , it's power .
for you , i'd say respect .
look , the crime is not stealing the story , son .
the crime is getting caught .
so , why don't we join the party?
there are some people i'd really like you to meet .
they , too , have done what it takes .
triumph over adversity .
i'm a whore .
mr. robinson , you have a call on line 1 .
thank you .
robinson .
it's me .
we cleaned up the tracking .
god , hank .
it's horrible .
all right .
play it .
stop it !
it's enough !
what?
did you have to make such a scene?
aribau filmed the whole thing , right?
nobody will suspect me .
he saw what we wanted him to see .
oh , jesus .
these people are savages .
we have to broadcast this , hank .
oh , god .
all right , don't do anything yet .
just give me a little time , all right?
okay .
important call?
don't you knock?
so what's the plan?
the plan?
well , i thought i'd finish my puff piece on manuel pla ... go down to the local watering hole , get shit faced , and try and get laid .
yesterday , you were going to change the world .
well , i thought better that .
so you're going to do nothing?
you're the one that wanted to leave it alone .
so it's people like you and me that help mcgovern get away with murder .
listen to hank , jr . !
you and your daddy are cut from the same cloth .
let's leave my father out of it .
no , i don't think so .
it must have been tough growing up in the great man's shadow .
but let me cut him down to size for you .
howard robinson covers the islamic revolution ... that topples the shah of iran .
he backs it up with eyewitness accounts of atrocities and mass murders .
truth is , he spent most of his days in the tehran hilton , shagging me .
bullshit .
his stories were ripped off from local persian journalists ... most of whom , i might add , did not survive the ayatollah's purges .
no witness , no one to expose him .
what , nothing to say?
hank , look on the bright side .
he would've been so proud of you .
no , with all due respect , i think you're wrong .
no , you should lead with this , then pick this up later .
it is much stronger , believe me .
yes , okay .
our report on seor pla .
fair and balanced , i hope .
just like you asked for .
good lad .
you know , nicola , i think our hank is beginning to tire of barcelona .
perhaps we should find a more interesting spot for him .
baghdad , say , or kabul?
i'm so sorry , archie .
no , it's my fault .
really .
i'm such a klutz !
it's all right .
no problem .
sorry .
thank you very much .
you're welcome .
you two need a coffee break .
now .
just wanted to let you know that we're going to do a story on you .
one i think you'll be rather pleased with .
well , let me see .
computer genius ... " and internet pioneer .
wait .
legendary entrepreneur .
when we are finished , the whole world will want to get into bed with you .
the sky is the limit .
robinson is a good dog .
he'll fetch and do as he's told .
besides , it would be rather unfortunate to have to ... put down another journalist .
nicola !
my turn to run into you .
any special plans tonight?
those are top secret .
is it chanel you're wearing?
archie !
who's the lucky man?
i'll never tell .
do i know him?
you'll never get away with this , you know .
dating fellow employees is against company regulations .
okay , i'll quit .
look , let me give you a ride .
no , thanks , archie .
you're not going my way .
bye .
goodbye .
i'm so sorry , archie .
nicola , you sneaky little devil .
nicola !
i had the story in my hands .
all right .
i loved your father .
i'll nail them to a wall .
i swear to you .
what are you waiting for?
impress me .
brechner .
listen , they killed her , okay?
nicola .
they killed nicola .
meet me at 7tv , all right?
we end this now .
robinson !
hank , what happened?
don't ask .
listen , is the tape set?
yes , we can broadcast ...
from the studio right now .
okay .
brechner .
go round back .
make sure the rats don't escape .
i'm calling the cops .
hello .
hey , how are you doing?
brechner .
no , no , no .
call me crusader .
yeah , that's it .
he's on his cell phone .
keep him talking .
if i can find his frequency , we can broadcast it from the studio .
listen , maybe we can cut a deal .
all right?
i'm afraid not , pal .
you're not working out as we had hoped .
your resignation is required .
i even convinced mcgovern to recruit you .
i've got his frequency .
i followed you for a week after the nova incident .
you never showed any sign of remorse , not once .
i said , " this is our guy !
i even cleaned up after you .
remember joaquim?
a few drops of hydrochloric acid in a glass of beer ... problem solved , if you know what i mean .
nicola?
an injection .
straight to the aorta .
melts away the protective cardiac tissue .
looks just like a heart attack , don't you think?
very clean .
hey , that's my set .
hank , i had help .
you helped me .
they are all dead because of you .
you endangered their lives just so you could get one step closer .
to what , hank?
the top?
greed .
so ugly , isn't it , hank?
i may have done the deed , but you sure made it easy .
listen to me , you son of a bitch !
now , now , now , hank !
you should be thanking me .
you're not dead .
the only reason you're still alive is because ...
i've allowed you to .
why don't you go to hell?
maybe i will .
but after you , my friend .
and hank , when you get there ... say hi to carlos aribau .
hello .
i don't think so .
you know , this is the second time i've had to hold a gun to your head .
you remember .
i think i've let you live long enough .
god damn it !
this is so sweet .
interpol .
everything is all right .
what?
good thing your friend pedro called the police ... when he saw your impromptu broadcast .
we've been tracking these two for months .
so he was using your identity as a cover , and you've been ...
following me to get to him .
well , i'm sorry .
excuse me .
i got to go .
yeah .
are you all right?
yeah .
i've been better .
i'm sorry .
the tape will destroy pla .
it's finally over .
not quite .
did you have to make such a scene?
aribau filmed the whole thing , right?
nobody will suspect me .
he saw what we wanted him to see .
the evidence of the released videotape led to the immediate arrest of manuel pla .
the damning video was shot by ... journalist carlos aribau and his cameraman .
i stole it .
i apologise to them ... and to you .
as journalists , we have all taken a sacred oath ... to report nothing but the truth .
but sometimes ... in the mad race for glory and ratings ... we forget our promise .
it's then your duty to remind us ... to keep us vigilant , to keep us honest ... to keep us fair .
because in the end ... you get the press you deserve .
this is hank robinson for vision tv ... signing off .
what are you all staring at?
get back to work !
what the hell do you think you've done?
by ruining me , you've only achieved your own destruction , son .
i'm not your son , i have a father , you piece of shit .
don't  temper , mcgovern .
you don't want us to add assault to the other charges .
not that it would make much difference .
take care , mr. robinson .
thank you .
hey , marisa .
that motto from your class .
what was it?
believe nothing of what you hear and only half of what you see .
words to the wise .
that's for you .
thank you .
mr. robinson .
yeah?
can i get my old job back?
i'll think about it .
