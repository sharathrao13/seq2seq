nothing is necessarily what it appears to be .
stockholm , 22nd december , 1945 .
dear martin , i've long had this letter in my thoughts .
after some reflection i have decided to resign as literary critic with you .
it's not about the publishing house .
you and bonniers have alwa ys treated me warmly and respectfully .
i'm grateful you allowed me to publish my own small works
even if they weren't financially rewarding .
no , in that now the war is over and i have no family ties in sweden
i see the possibility of setting off for europe and trying new things .
make a difference !
create !
i hope that you , who know me so well , understand .
so , my brother , thank you for everything .
perhaps we'll meet again .
merry christmas .
your friend , gunnar wern .
p. s. concerning my last duty as reviewer
i can't recommend that you publish mrs lindgren's " pippi longstocking " .
the story strikes me as too bizarre and amoral .
possibly , one could create a children's novel
with the somewhat intelligible characters , tommy and annika .
but to confide that task to a barely literate housewife is unadvisable .
no , a craftsman's talent as a writer is required here .
no ... !
illumlnatlon a film about trains
i'm scared .
i love you .
will you also kill me the day you tire of me?
i won't get tired of you .
to kill one's wife for the love of another ...
can god forgive that?
god has forgiven hitler .
how do you know?
i feel it .
i wish i had your faith .
you'll become catholic when we marry .
i thought they couldn't remarry?
not if they divorce , but if they become widowers .
marie , listen to me .
she is ill !
we're sparing her years of suffering .
that's what .
she won't get better .
only sicker , more bitter and meaner .
i'm a doctor , i know .
why can't you just get a divorce?
you want us to get married .
she'll take half of what i've worked years to get together .
we'd live shabbily with our shameful love .
we'd never be respectable .
she'd shadow us like an avaricious phantom screaming for more money .
infecting our love , spreading poisonous rumours among our friends
until we only had each other to vent our sorrow and fury upon .
is that how you want it?
no ...
this is how you want it .
this is what we want .
and we've earned it , haven't we?
yes , henry , we have .
what are we doing?
we're shortening one person's life
so that two others can be happier .
isn't that right?
not after man's laws ruled by money , but in god's kingdom where love reigns .
what should i do?
this is chlonedin .
it's for migraines which my wife gets .
she takes them .
in small , normal doses it's fine .
but just one of those tablets
contains as much as in a whole tin .
such a dose leads to feelings of euphoria followed by extreme fatigue .
especially combined with alcohol .
if a tired person having taken too much
falls from a train ... well that's nothing more than a tragic accident .
but you prescribed her medicine .
i'm in stockholm when she takes it .
it's not blood thirst , marie .
it's gone too far .
i can't even touch her .
i'm disgusted by her .
i don't know whether i can do this .
do you love me?
yes .
love conquers all .
believe me .
god will give you strength .
a little push and we're free .
she won't feel a thing .
she dies happy , we meet in berlin .
in berlin ...
and we'll have a child .
not here .
imagine experiencing all this .
being looked after .
it's like being a film star .
little me .
but what a waste , it's scandalous !
it's typical of me .
i just help myself .
i have a weakness for luxury , that's it .
i want to secretly taste the cream .
mum used to get so angry with me ...
it's been awhile .
i'll have a big bag .
and some chocolate as well .
look , mum , real oranges !
imagine that !
could i?
of course .
what a nice gentleman !
thank him properly .
thank you .
have a merry christmas .
who are these poor people?
refugees from the baltic states .
eat something for everyone's sake .
god has been at my side for the war .
he will be with me for this journey .
you are fantastic .
what am i doing?
excuse me !
no , no , it's just fine .
this shoulder usually pops out .
i'm so sorry !
no , it's a scream .
let's see ...
can i do anything?
that could have been a problem .
the sun is shining ...
what the hell are you doing?
i beg your forgiveness .
i was wrapped in thought .
i'm sorry .
you didn't hurt yourself?
no , not at all .
you are too sweet .
didn't you think i'd manage to find the right train?
i managed to get awa y for a minute .
how could you go out in such thin shoes?
i had to rush off so suddenly .
you going back to the practice?
i have to .
the da y before christmas eve?
and how's our little head?
not so good , actually .
but it will probably be better if i eat dinner .
have you eaten?
i'll eat later .
i brought your pills .
you and your pills !
i'm really worried about you .
you must eat , my dear , or the practice will eat you up one da y .
i don't like the staff working late .
you always think of others .
yes ... that is probably my way .
get going and eat a little dinner anywa y .
we'll meet in two da ys in milan .
we could have gone together .
that's the result of not wanting to fly .
two da ys is nothing .
not for you , perhaps .
don't try .
you won't miss me that much .
karin , how little you know me .
serves you right in that case !
i love you .
i love you .
what is it?
i can't do it ...
everything !
just grab the handle , open the door and push her out .
like this .
is that so hard?
who's slamming the door?
are you slamming the door?
this isn't an amusement park !
hello !
you can slam doors at home !
travel by car !
people ... !
i can't come with , don't you understand?
i can't be seen .
what if i bump into her?
i don't even have a ticket !
can't you buy a ticket?
and be noticed by the conductor?
and my passport? !
damn !
don't swear !
hello !
you're missing the train !
thanks so much !
i'm coming !
don't bother yourself ...
i'm sorry ...
excuse me , go inside , i'm fine .
i just ...
doors must be kept closed !
it's me that can't keep time .
i'm awfully sorry .
it's no problem .
a crutch , ma ybe .
of course .
i would ask you to calm down !
it was a mishap .
i wanted to do good .
that's the spirit !
we should be happy .
it's me that's the sourpuss .
it's like my old mother said ...
she was so festive .
" with a son like you , there's no fun " .
you poor man .
after all you've been through .
the war was nothing .
northern finland was beautiful in winter .
look , numbered seats !
sorry !
good day .
good day .
take the cane .
get out the food .
in the crocodile skin case .
and the newspaper ...
in the blue case .
no , no ...
in the blue one .
are you colour blind?
be careful with my things !
i bought that in london .
take care of this .
travelling with you is what i'd call a real pleasure .
ma y i tempt you?
no thanks .
all the better for me .
and the scarf .
the scarf !
what an age it takes !
have you seen how he fusses about?
is this what you would call a holiday?
i must really apologise for my friend .
sixten kvarnstrm .
gunnar wern .
the critic?
and author ...
yes .
this is pomp .
theodor bckstrm .
poofter pomp .
and what are you?
i sought out men because i hated women .
it's different .
you're embarrassing our companion .
embarrassing a critic?
that'd be like asking a cadaver to dance the cancan .
he's not alwa ys like this .
are you off to the continent to celebrate christmas?
not exactly to celebrate christmas .
i was thinking of berlin .
we're also going there .
i don't mind if it's destroyed .
at least you can be yourself .
of course .
just look at hitler .
i hear many authors are off to europe?
that's correct .
personally , i'm not travelling to write .
no ... but you must surely be looking for something?
well , this may sound strange and a little nave , but ...
i'd like to make a difference .
yes .
excuse me a second ...
excuse me a second !
make a difference?
make a difference !
do something good .
imagine helping to construct a europe that is now so destroyed .
i heard berlin has been flattened .
that's exactly what draws me .
no , no , you must think i sound crazy ...
it's fascinating to be present and assist in the birth of a new , united europe .
that's exactly how i feel !
you?
that would be fitting .
a poofter as midwife?
like asking an eskimo to run a banana plantation .
no one here is laughing .
no , my upbringing prohibits it !
it's all about the will .
who knows , ma ybe i'll learn how to be a mason .
i'm looking to believe in something .
i see .
like wittgenstein?
yes , i find wittgenstein interesting , even if there's much i don't understand .
wittgenstein is an idiot .
all people are idiots to you .
yes , that's true .
i think you will really like berlin .
have you been there often?
no , never unfortunately .
we bathe in a sea of experience .
why are you so unpleasant?
i'm unpleasant?
because i doubt the authority that praises a city never seen?
or that i question a critic who wants to believe
and embraces a philosopher who believes in nothing?
did you know that wittgenstein , in a debate with turing was asked
just so the discussion could move on , to admit
that just at that moment there were no hippopotami present?
but wittgenstein refused .
and so i ask myself , what can such a philosopher ever get one to believe in?
he doesn't mean for us to reject knowledge , but to constantly question it .
i see .
as an apprentice mason , you'll have much to stand in , that's for sure .
nothing is necessarily what it appears to be .
that's not a bad starting point , i think .
precisely .
you agree with that hag philosophy?
why do you hate women?
i've never seen good come from one .
but , there's a mirror in the toilet ...
that was funny !
that was , by god , the funniest thing i've heard !
i'll live long on that .
cunt humour !
i'm going to the restaurant car to have a real dinner .
i didn't mean to be funny .
it's alwa ys wrong .
i didn't mean to upset you .
i never get upset .
it would disturb my alcoholism dosage .
if you could only once sit down and listen to others !
it would do you good to have a little break from your bitter monologue .
but you are really the most egocentric person i ever met !
am i , who alwa ys perceived my surroundings as a personal affront
am i egocentric?
i'm sorry .
there's nothing to be sorry for .
i don't understand humour .
don't worry about him .
he'll soon be happier , as long as he's had enough .
it's really nothing to do with me , but ...
how do you stand it?
well , i'm old now ...
yes , he is too .
it hasn't always been like this .
but you grow together .
and a shared hell is at any rate better than one alone .
are you married?
no , it never happened .
never happened ...?
my god , you're a young man .
i'm 38 .
38 years old ...
when i was 38
i was thrown out of clubs and restaurants every night .
all week !
yes ...
i would even be so bold as to suggest i was something of
a legend in stockholm society at that time .
oh , yes ...
everyone wanted to sit at pomp's table .
writers and artists
actors ...
i only thought of having fun .
and you did?
yes , i did !
yes , i assure you , i had fun !
gracious , what fun i've had ...
it's very nice to talk to you as well , young man .
thank you .
thank you .
you have no idea how it gladdens me to spread good thoughts .
but imagine if it is as you said?
what do you mean?
that one can't know how something is ...
maybe i didn't even have fun?
i perhaps only think i had fun?
no , not at all .
perhaps it is just like a dream ...
a horrid dream ...
my whole life ... has just been absolutely awful !
you're just fantasizing .
of course you've had fun !
but , nothing is what it appears to be .
perhaps i'm not even a real ... homo .
of course , you're a fantastic homo !
it's just your imagination .
exactly , it's imagination , all just imagination !
i'm just like a scarecrow .
a homosexual forgery ... !
stop !
i'm extremely sorry .
who cares about a poofter in tears?
me !
you have no idea ...
ow , my head !
do you have a headache , as well?
please ...
allow me to help in some way .
do you want a glass of water?
something from the restaurant?
coffee?
do you like tea?
all these questions !
be strong ...
excuse me .
i apologise for my broken body .
so that's how they look .
that's unusual .
well ... water in a carafe ...
i'll just ...
i'll be right back .
how are you?
so , it's you?
how nice .
we seem to bump into one another .
this is crazy , it's not happening !
don't think about it .
i'm on home leave .
i'll be having christmas with dad .
i'll help him la y the roof on the barn .
he gets vertigo in his wheelchair .
but one shouldn't be downcast .
there's a little damage here .
oh , god ...
tickets !
i remember ...
i can lie down , too .
i have to go the restaurant car .
i'll pa y someone to help with the roof .
be careful of my train !
i'll pa y for that too .
pay , pay !
he's so impulsive ...
sorry , but were you going to see your father?
yes .
it will the first christmas in uppsala for years .
dad's excited .
uppsala?
this train goes to berlin .
berlin?
there's no end to the surprises on this trip .
don't be angry anymore .
please .
i can't stand it when you're annoyed with me .
i'll try , i promise .
you promised at the station .
i know , i'm sorry !
how can i marry someone i can't trust?
i want you to trust me .
confidence , marie .
if a married couple don't know where the other stands ...
test me , henry , give me another chance .
you don't have to marry me .
why do you sa y that?
because all that is important to me , is your happiness .
i've asked too much of you when i ask you to help me to mine .
perhaps i've been egoistic .
darling , darling henry ...
i beg you , forgive me and let me show you i'm ready to do anything for you .
forgive me .
this isn't easy for me , either .
i understand .
but you are strong .
our child will also be strong .
tickets . !
just a moment .
it's enough to press the handle and the door slides opens .
sorry , i'll think of that next time .
some behave as if they own the train .
really?
but miss is a responsible traveller .
really?
one sees that immediately .
miss is aware there's no stop before berlin?
really?
troops and refugees have to return .
really?
yes .
good to have people in the right country , but it upsets the timetable .
yes .
we must all sacrifice , do our duty and struggle as we can .
thank you for the chat , i wish you a pleasant christmas .
i have to work .
really?
i always work .
you handled that well .
drink this , it'll calm you down .
come , i'll show you what to do .
where is it now?
there , perhaps ...
there , then ...
how did you do that?
trade secret ...
cheers .
if you'd drunk that , you would have enjoyed your last cognac .
you have to distract her when you drop it .
it ma y foam a little .
and you must make sure she takes some form of alcohol .
am i good?
my wife will be very happy .
am i good?
so , the ice is broken ...
goodness , it's awful .
that she's so good?
no , i mean on the train .
you've never done it on a train?
trains are good .
you kind of get the rhythm for free .
that was fast , i must say .
the youth of toda y are in such a hurry .
are you married?
yes .
and you?
mrit .
karin schmalensee .
oh , you're a jewess?
do you have anything against that?
not at all , i was just surprised .
you don't look like one .
what does a jewess look like?
i don't know any jews .
do you?
yes .
my husband is from a jewish family .
but we don't see them .
he converted to catholicism .
interesting .
so you're also catholic?
i was in love and he wanted it .
i go to mass , but it doesn't mean as much to me as to henry , my husband .
are you a believer?
difficult question .
i'm like most people .
when things go well , god and i sa y a polite hello
around christmas .
then , when things are tough , i seek him constantly !
you're funny .
yes , i am .
it's unusual .
because i'm a woman or i'm old?
you're not old .
how old are you?
i'm 36 and a half .
don't sa y " and a half " !
small children and men buying sports cars sa y that .
36 ...
you're barely confirmed .
it feels a bit like that .
are you happy?
you ask such questions !
i can return to my eyebrows ...
no , i haven't spoken like this in ages .
yes , i think i'm happy .
do you have children?
no , my husband can't have them .
that's sad to hear .
you sure it's him that can't have any?
yes , i think so .
i was pregnant once .
when i was young .
you are young , when will you understand that?
probably not until you're old .
that's what usually happens .
are you sure you want him?
a new husband might give you a child .
i love henry .
don't you feel well?
i have a slight migraine .
you're carrying an entire pharmacy !
could i see?
chlonedin ...
they just make you tired .
they actually help .
i usually don't take medicine .
but henry alwa ys prescribes new pills for me .
he treats me as if i was dying .
i have something much better .
homemade cider vinegar with henbane .
i make it myself .
merry christmas !
where do people get it from?
a glass of water ...
it's cider vinegar .
i saw that at once .
she looked so pretty .
nothing is necessarily what it appears to be .
for migraines ...
ah , i see ... mushroom soup .
you are a good person , but it's throwing pearls after swine ...
warm food is on the way .
why?
one old poofter more or less ...
there can never be too many old poofters , right?
sorry .
i'm so sorry it turned out this wa y .
let me make up for it , and we'll discuss wittgenstein .
you'll understand .
i didn't even understand the preface .
what does he mean
that you can't know if you've been on the moon or not?
i probably destroyed my brain with drink
during that awful time in stockholm !
the moon isn't so important , it's how and what we remember .
i remember everything !
like yesterday .
you opened the window and aired the fog like tissue of lies
that had camouflaged my real story .
thanks .
dear you , for the truth .
i remember everything in my life .
such an awful life .
poor pomp !
there's fish and mashed potatoes .
my whole world ... ... is mashed ...
and petit pois ...
pearls for a ... disgusting homo boar !
pearls ...
it was just a train .
sorry , i had such an awful dream ...
dinner is in ten minutes .
god , i won't be able to eat a thing .
she will .
she alwa ys eats dinner .
why do you never call her by name?
she " or " my wife " , never karin .
it's for you .
i don't want to hurt you .
but you do hurt me .
we owe a murder victim her name .
not murder , marie .
life shortening , relief from suffering .
i still think she is worth her real name in her last few hours .
allright ...
karin .
at midnight , karin's suffering will be over .
will you confess afterwards?
i confess every sunda y .
you will tell the priest .
of course .
will you talk of me as well?
i have to .
and if the priest gossips?
marie , a priest can't gossip about a confession .
he's made a holy oath before god .
just like when you got married .
what are you getting at?
as soon as i ask , you get angry !
i don't understand some things .
i have to ask , for god's sake !
ask ...
a true catholic , as far as i understand , can't even get married?
that's true .
the pure doctrine
advocates that one live as a celibate to get as close to god as possible .
how has god imagined that the human family would survive?
that's a tough question .
some holy oaths are holier than others and even if you break the holiest
you can always confess afterwards and then it's fine .
yes , that's how it is .
it sounds very practical .
you shouldn't make fun of it as you'll miss the actual essence .
namely , that god is perfect .
man is not .
that's why he has ordained rules that make it easier for us to live .
i think i understand perfectly .
no , you don't .
because you joke that you , with your paltry human understanding
claim to understand god's meaning .
i'm just trying to ally my conscience with my actions .
do you trust me?
i trust you .
do you trust me?
as i trust myself .
what if she doesn't take the tablet?
she ma y not want to share a table .
women are drawn to one another when surrounded by gentlemen .
you know everything about women?
i know that if you , if it goes wrong ... ... were to feign illness , she would help you back to your compartment .
and i'll be waiting here .
it's vile , scandalous !
just like you , just now !
i brought christmas ham as well , so you can choose .
he's wonderful , this wittgenstein .
where does he get it all from?
you're happy again !
have you had anything?
yes ...
you go your wa y , and i'll go my way , and we'll never meet ...
no !
we'll meet ...
maybe you shouldn't take so many .
i'm worried now ...
why did i give you these?
we should find a doctor .
come to pomp and we'll pla y doctor !
this is no game !
why not?
sixten always pla ys doctor , when he's in the mood ...
what fun it is to be happy !
does anyone know if there's a doctor on the train?
do you know if there's a doctor on board?
no ...
waiter !
good !
what is that for?
in case .
just in case .
wait , i'll tell you .
so that damn good for nothing falls in love ...
you left him straight awa y?
yes .
you see , a man with no imagination , you don't have fun with him .
henry would never deceive me .
you understand that i wish you well , but never sa y never .
never even about yourself .
it's curious , you see , but of all the people one knows
i think one knows oneself least of all .
what should you do about that?
well ...
you should try to spend some time with yourself .
not the person you desperately want to be , but the one that you are .
women are more exciting than men .
that's just how it is .
it's nothing to grin over , it's obvious !
i'm hungry and my headache has gone .
shall we get a bite to eat?
no thanks , i'm going to read .
what are you reading?
the butcher in the cloister .
i love these , i alwa ys read them .
unfortunately i've become too good at guessing who the murderer is .
i assure you it is the abbess .
they're starting again .
calm down !
get yourself together , marie .
we never talked of injecting her .
in case .
that's all i said .
what's that?
it's just a calmative .
do you know of a doctor on the train?
what has happened?
do you know of a doctor onboard?
no idea .
is it serious?
perhaps .
i have a travelling companion who isn't well .
he took some medicine that wasn't his ...
i don't know .
ask the conductor .
yes , the conductor ...
most people will be in the restaurant car .
why don't you enquire there?
don't you feel well?
it's no problem .
just a headache .
perhaps it's the snowstorm .
yes , i understand .
terrible weather .
maybe you should come with me and have a bite to eat?
thank you , i think i'll do that .
go ahead , i'll be along shortly .
i'll just check on my travelling companion .
he's a tad homosexual .
she was in the next compartment?
it would seem so .
the whole time?
it would seem so .
will you be able to do this?
take a tablet if you're so worried .
darling ...
don't touch me !
trust me .
wait , i can help ...
goddamn , bugger , shit , hell ... !
sorry !
are you oka y?
these were real laplandish boots !
can i pa y you something?
i'm just trying to be nice , carrying soup to the poor refugees ...
hang on ...
can i help in some way?
i can dry myself !
this is the last time i volunteer and make a spectacle of myself !
are you sure you'll be fine?
go to hell !
bloody hell , goddamn shit !
how are you?
some bloody idiot has left glass on the floor !
let me take this ...
thanks .
let's go to the toilet and have a look .
thanks .
you're so kind .
i'm actually a doctor .
sometimes one is lucky in life ...
occupled
would you like anything else?
no , thanks .
have to stop somewhere .
soup and a chair and i don't know what else .
nice restaurant car ...
i think .
let me know if you need anything .
it's already too much .
thank you .
pardon , where is the lady's room?
continue straight ahead .
thank you .
sorry , is there is a doctor on board?
have you seen the conductor?
well , the conductor ...
we don't really get on ...
i see , so that's the story .
we have a little cold , do we?
no , i'm absolutely fine .
it's my travelling companion .
i get it .
i was barman at berns .
on the gallery .
the toffee balcony .
i see .
right ...
i think the gentleman has a friend over at that table ...
theodor's unwell .
he's taken something .
who hasn't?
have you no heart?
sure , it's just a little marinated .
you must help him !
i recognize that voice .
i'm not finished here .
is it sergeant axelsson?
why are you so unpleasant?
what joy is there in hurting others?
axelsson is a tenor .
this is more of a soft baritone .
is it me , of the two of us
who has a passion for hurting others?
i might hurt myself , that's true .
but you can't deny that i support the restaurant business .
there was a bite to this soup .
i must have the recipe .
waiter?
you will drink yourself to death .
life is no more fun by extending it .
waiter ...
this tomato soup is fantastic .
how did you do it?
my god , look at you !
is it you?
i can't see .
is it you?
i'm so terribly sorry !
i must make it up to you somehow .
no , no ... absolutely not !
everything is fine .
don't find me picky , but our meetings so far have been of a violent nature .
i feel so good just now ...
i just want to sit here and enjoy .
all alone !
i have to go .
i'll come back .
we must talk .
better with higher infant mortality .
that it should be so hard to be pleasant !
have you found a doctor?
no .
have you seen the lady you came with?
no , sorry ...
fantastic !
what a bite to this soup !
spanish peppers ...
and no hot dogs to hand .
it's doesn't burn , but not far from it .
wonderful !
what happened?
sorry .
did i spill something?
i'm probably in the way .
vacant
excuse me , my mistake .
no bother .
evening .
are you alone?
i'm expecting someone .
a table for two ...
would you like anything to drink?
a cognac , please .
has anything happened .
no , not at all .
ma y i join you?
of course .
i've ordered a cognac .
i'll join you .
two cognacs , please .
a case of cognac for me too .
ah , so you are staring?
you women are used to free entertainment .
i think that's enough cognac .
a pail of absinthe with a straw , then .
we won't mind him .
no ...
you never have done !
the snow is beautiful .
like a whore's arse at christmas .
what are you sa ying?
i had to .
can't stand to be close .
there are women present .
women are constantly absent .
have you no respect for women?
being a woman is a wa y of avoiding public responsibility .
two cognacs .
thank you .
i suggest the gentleman retire .
you don't know what you ask of me , my boy .
could i pa y?
the gentleman has already paid .
that's something .
just a minute .
have to watch the household budget .
yes , let's go ...
good girl .
listen here ...
i never believed in you !
may i sit down?
could i trouble you for a drop of port?
it must be terribly warm sitting in that costume and mask?
but what don't we do for children?
my first husband , kjell hugo
he sweated so awfully , we couldn't even touch one another !
in bed i had to sleep in rain clothes .
poor man ...
cheers .
cheers .
sorry , what behaviour .
forgive me .
are you not well?
i'm ...
i'll just go ...
i'll just go to the lady's room .
excuse me , could i have the bill?
i am just going to look after my companion .
good , get her to our carriage .
what are you mumbling about?
i'll have another , it's christmas !
my second husband , bertil ...
good god , what has happened here?
these people have lived in a camp for several years .
they've eaten nothing but bread and porridge .
then some idiot in stockholm gave them chocolate and oranges .
i'm at the end of my tether .
it's been two da ys since we slept .
we struggle and do our best , and he buys chocolate and oranges .
he probably meant well .
of course .
have you seen a doctor?
are you also ill?
no , it's not me .
it's a friend .
he just keeps laughing .
i see .
if you should find a doctor , could you be so kind as to send him over?
after you friend has stopped laughing .
this takes precedence , of course .
he's not laughing that much .
if one could only do something .
let me take care of that ...
i'm sorry ...
i'm sorry ...
my fifth husband , karl erik ...
he was the most problematic .
he was so scared of floors .
imagine that?
so i had to carry him all the time and he was so fat .
what the hell?
yes , you could sa y that !
i see you're on the edge of your seat .
thank you very much .
in the beginning we lived in stocksund , but there was so much floor there ...
and your companion?
i don't know where she went .
so we bought a boathouse in falsterbo and i was seven months pregnant .
then he developed a water phobia .
the door of our compartment opens on its own .
could you ...?
we'll look at it at once .
we don't want further accidents on this trip .
it was sad , as he was a priest and the nuns didn't understand him .
go and pee .
i think i'll have another drink .
bartender?
have you got any port?
i know beatrice , but you must forgive him .
i've tried to maintain my faith throughout this entire war !
i have struggled , struggled to give a slither of light to people
who have gone through the most unimaginable darkness .
i've bandaged war invalids with barely a body to bandage !
my tears flowed , i almost choked with sorrow and disgust over man's outrage .
but i did it .
i did it !
i believed !
i tried to forgive the inexplicable !
you must rest ...
how can i rest when he's at large?
who knows what he'll get up to next?
you heard what the conductor said?
he's a writer you sa y?
that's what he calls himself .
how can you give starving people ... ... chocolate and oranges? !
what a cock up !
what an out and out bloody idiot !
there is no god !
believe me .
no god could have created such an idiotic bumbler .
he was trying to do good , you said?
that's what he said .
i have lost my faith !
after all these years !
goddamn bloody shit and piss !
beatrice ...
don't sit and sa y beatrice the whole time like some bloody parrot !
don't you think i know my name?
just because god seems to have forgotten !
i understand how you feel .
what is it you understand so well?
how do you think it feels to have a million tons of chicken on your head?
if you get hold of him , you'll kill him won't you?
don't let the damned nuisance live .
promise me .
the railway doesn't have that authority .
there seem to be signs of life here !
it smells like my old barracks .
that's also his work .
of course it is .
how do you feel?
i feel so good , i have tablets ... ... that put music over everything .
oops , sorry , miss .
hello !
you can't go there , it's for the army !
let him wander about .
what could possibly be worse?
the whole train's going straight to hell , anyway .
i also think it's important that we think positively .
you ladies can feel safe , it works .
thanks so much .
no bother .
thank you .
how could you let that sweetie go so quickly .
have you no judgement?
i must go to see what happened to her .
if i were you , but a man , i'd never chase after
a little goose that can't even drink a cognac without spilling it .
i'll be back soon .
my first man said that too .
on his return i didn't recognise him .
i don't feel at all sorry for you .
people are crazy .
lucky i'm an old maid .
father christmas !
please , could she say hello?
what a hurry he was in .
he has to take care of lots of girls .
marie , are you there?
henry?
what's happening?
nothing , the lock has jammed .
did you speak to her?
let me out !
did you speak to her? !
let me out !
is it you?
yes ...
there was a strange sound .
it was the wind on opening the door .
did you find a doctor?
no .
i've searched the whole train .
the wagon in front of this is the last before the locomotive and it's empty .
oh , conductor?
i'm looking for my companion ...
excuse me !
now you have gone too far !
maiming war heroes and poisoning refugees is one thing .
we have off da ys .
but playing with the emergency brake !
don't you see the penalty? !
i don't care that it's christmas , this is being reported !
unless you have a very good explanation .
i saw father christmas .
father christmas?
where?
please , miss ...
here , outside the door !
right !
if you all have your wish lists ready , let's go and speak to him .
who knows , maybe the reindeer were tired and wanted to go by train !
i saw him clearly !
my grandmother claims gnomes pinch her sherry in the pantry at night .
was he alone?
or did he have the wife with him?
ma ybe some elves needed to pee?
he stood there !
we've lost at least six minutes .
like i said , this will be reported !
i tell you i saw a person through the window .
someone in danger !
what should i have done !
come , lady , we're losing time .
right , report and driver's licence .
the police will contact you .
i tried to save a person's life .
it's no fun ...
but those are the rules which i'd rather follow than having fun .
had this been texas , you would have been shot by now .
it would be appropriate to be grateful .
henry !
oh , henry , what should i do?
was it you ...?
i don't know ...
i don't know how to thank you ...
god , you need a doctor .
i am a doctor .
even we have to get dressed up once a year .
i've searched the train for a doctor .
what for?
a man in my compartment swallowed lots of tablets .
he's behaving oddly .
what kind?
i think they're chlonedin .
that's okay .
just make sure he doesn't drink alcohol .
it's lethal .
really?
go on , i'll be allright .
i'll come and see him in a while .
i'm in the last carriage .
we're in the carriage behind the restaurant car .
thanks so much !
sorry , darling , sorry !
good god !
quiet !
why couldn't you open it?
i don't know .
i'm not so strong .
maybe i did something wrong .
when i tried it , nothing happened .
i did what you said , but i was so nervous when i was going to drink ...
there , there ...
i'm useless , i can't do anything !
there , there , it's okay now .
you just got a little unlucky .
now we have all the time in the world .
we know where she's sitting now .
look at the state of you ...
everything is my fault and you sa y nothing .
you are the most kind man in the world .
i know how we should kill her .
hello?
is anyone there?
i've gone around the whole train , but it seems everyone wants to go at once .
and what a long time some people take .
one even took in a soup pot !
what do you give me for that?
it was so funny , i was sitting sewing and i got an ice skate in my eye !
but i feel so good !
i'll sit in my cabin in the meantime .
jesus is in you , darling !
thank you ...
i don't understand .
i small glass of port , please .
your nice friend has left .
it's fine .
i found a doctor .
what will a doctor be able to do without an operating theatre?
no , no .
the doctor said he shouldn't drink alcohol .
what has alcohol got to do with it?
don't you know , the poor soldier
you set on fire had his whole face burnt?
set on fire?
you lit his cigarette .
his bandage ...
oh , my god ... !
it's not true !
i must report myself to the police .
it's a popular notion on this train .
apropos , your friend took a bottle of jameson when he left .
sixten?
call him whatever , as long as he pa ys .
what if he gives it to pomp?
what have i done? !
alcohol and chlonedin !
pomp?
a swedish soldier burns ...
and he thinks of his dog .
you clumsy fool !
why do you try and help all the time?
good god ... !
i hope , hope , hope ...
doctor !
doctor !
jesus christ ...
you alone control life and death .
give me the strength in my difficult task .
help me to kill the one that prevents me living the life
that you have chosen for me .
amen .
it's fine now .
that's good .
it's not at all fine .
she's drunk .
just cut off his head ...
let it roll ...
i'm so sorry .
i meant well ...
so you're back again?
of course , some of us are still alive .
beatrice , keep quiet .
i'm going to kill myself .
you do that !
let me know if you need help !
clumsy bugger !
henry never drinks alcohol .
and you love him?
i think i love his moral sense .
his strong faith .
you know where you have henry ...
the waiter fixed that .
well , gunnar ...
there's nothing left .
do it .
do it ... !
that will have to be my nightcap .
i have to think of my beauty sleep .
sleep well .
good god !
why must i be so bloody clumsy? !
you can at least help me to die? !
sorry for all the ill i've caused !
no !
it's jammed .
it's the crutch that's being wilful ...
hello?
are you locked in?
it's not you , is it?
say it isn't you !
i'll help you out .
no , no , that won't be necessary !
i'll be fine .
don't hold the handle !
i'm holding the handle !
did i break anything?
wait , your crutch .
there's a draught here ...
thank you .
you're too kind .
see you later ...
are you oka y?
are you going to smoke?
you can bet on it .
prudish little cunts are the worst .
you are fantastic .
help !
i'm stuck !
careful ...
now !
karin ...
it's not what you think .
you think too much !
no !
no ... !
look !
he managed one more anywa y .
have you read wittgenstein?
don't you feel well?
it's no problem .
just a headache .
wait , he has a syringe .
cheers .
cheers .
i'll just go to the lady's room .
i am just going to look after my companion .
imagine , it was the gardener !
how irritating .
life goes on .
think about what i said .
there are alwa ys new men .
thanks , but i think i have made up my mind .
merry christmas .
of course , it's christmas eve .
there goes a wonderful woman .
like me?
almost .
welcome , major .
i hope your journey was entertaining .
what do you think could happen on a train between stockholm and berlin?
away is nice , but home is best?
he stopped the train .
did you hear?
he stopped it !
sorry , i didn't mean to .
i wanted to build something good .
what has he done?
no idea ...
what we did , we did well .
we did it bloody well .
i love you .
i love you .
morning , gunnar !
it looks good .
and so stable .
that wall will be there for a long time .
it'll be nice for the kids , they can kick a ball against it .
it offers protection against the elements as well .
you can sit and catch a tan and lounge about .
it'll be great .
it's fantastic .
only three of you toda y?
someone off sick , are they?
it's easy to catch a cold out here in this biting wind .
i talked to heinz here .
a nice bloke .
precise and to the point .
he knows what he wants .
you've let your hair out a bit more today?
of course , you want to feel a little unbound and free sometimes ...
