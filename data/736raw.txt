name's lightyear , buzz lightyear .
i'm a space ranger .
my partner warp darkmatter and i ... work out ofstar command's universe protection unit .
at 0800 hours the report came in .
missing . three little green men .
lastseen .
starcommandscience bay .
alpha mission objective .
iocate l. g. m. sa . s. a. p.
we'll find and rescue these little green men ... even ifwe must go to infinity and beyond .
buzz lightyear mission log .
we've searched this gaseous planetoid from top to bottom ... with no sign ofthe missing personnel .
hey !
come on , buddy .
nobody ever reads those reports .
warp , my friend ... procedure is what separates us from the wicked forces ofchaos .
ah , buzz , if it means less paperwork , i'll take chaos .
oh , man .
give it up , partner .
this rock's as dead as it looks .
neverjudge a moon by its crater .
we'd better double check the dark side .
i'll drive .
well , mission accomplished .
three l. g. m. s disappeared .
wejust found three l. g. m. s .
well , i don't think these are the three missing little green men .
sure , not any more .
i'm afraid these three are stowaways .
ah , blast !
this won't look good in my report .
hey !
must save the lost ones !
whoa , whoa , whoa .
we'll find your amigos , boys . just not here .
here !
how can you be so sure?
mindlink .
oh , come on !
evil !
now you'rejust trying to freak us out .
no , it's my worst fear come true .
here we go .
this diabolical plot ... can only be the work ofthe sworn enemy ofthe galactic alliance ... evil emperor zurg !
what plot?
you think zurg is behind every kitten stuck up a tree !
the fiend !
why can't he leave kitty cats out of his nefarious schemes?
all i know is we've searched halfofthe zeta quadrant to find the missing l. g. m. s , and what do we find?
a lot of nothing !
there's something really bad behind me , isn't there?
crater viper !
look out !
crater vipers never hunt in packs .
tell them that !
thanks , partner .
looks like this moon's not so dead after all !
give me a minute .
it will be .
the lost ones !
what are you doing?
this way .
warp , hit 'em from below !
soft underbellies , eh?
let's see how ticklish .
i should've guessed !
a crater viper slag monster mutant !
the l. g. m. s !
must save the lost ones .
can't you just  warp , gemini split now !
any reason you were looking to shake hands with a beast from 20, 000 craters?
the lost ones are there !
oh , well , then i'd say they're the dead ones now .
let's get out of here .
ah !
i'm goin 'in !
follow my lead !
i hope you have a plan !
no more so than usual .
now what?
full throttle !
hit it !
the lost ones aren't in it !
they're under it !
not enough power !
all right .
new plan !
that was your plan?
most of it .
where are the l. g. m. s?
take a guess .
zurg !
i knew it .
wha
anything?
no .
oh !
he's not gonna like this .
anything?
no .
oh !
he's not going to like this .
oh .
aah !
uh , what should i tell him?
we have proven that the little green men think and feel as one .
we heh , heh just don't know how .
oh !
he's not gonna like this at all .
oh !
now what?
he , uh , he didn't like it .
e evil emperor zurg !
hi hi .
how are you?
the torture tank is good to go here as you can see , and i got everything
my bad .
we are one .
we will never talk .
do your worst .
my plan exactly .
blast !
laser resistant diabonic alloy .
let me try .
yes?
afteryou .
excuse us .
coming through .
get back in the ship and wait .
no !
now , i know this is personal foryou , but i must insist .
no !
okay , we're getting into a chain ofcommand area here , so really
we feel the pain .
oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , right .
it's their mindlink thing .
how do you do that anyway?
the unimind .
unimind?
the mystical orb that links all of l. g. m. kind .
it's on their home world .
ofcourse , that's need to know , classified .
i'm your partner .
i need to know .
now you do .
anything else i should know?
no , i'd say you're up to speed .
okay , thankyou .
tell me ofyour mindlink .
tell me your secret .
never !
oh .
i will just have to pickyour brains .
where's my cranial dissect a bot?
ah , lightyear .
evil emperor zurg , by the authority ofthe galactic alliance ... you are hereby charged with attempted dissection ofstar command personnel .
i shall destroy your galactic alliance .
but first , i shall destroy you !
well , not personally .
hornets , destroy buzz lightyear !
prepare to die , buzz lightyear !
not today , zurg !
hop on !
backup?
always a dramatic entrance , warp .
let's go after zurg !
not today , lightyear ... forlstartedtheself destruct sequence on my wayout .
it isa moon ofdoom now .
self destruct in 60seconds .
sixty seconds?
all the time in the world .
uh oh !
get to the ship !
blast off !
but , buzz !
that's an order !
we'll meet you in orbit .
self destruct in 45seconds .

we're partners !
self destruct in five ...
i said , " go ! " four , three ... two , one .
space ranger warp darkmatter sacrificed himself ... for the success of his mission , for the safety of his fellows .
i miss him very much .
buzz lightyear personal log .
in his crazed attempt to destroy me ...
zurg has robbed the universe ofa good man ... my partner , my friend .
on this day i vow no ranger will ever again ... fall in harm's way because of me .
i work alone .
commandernebula , report to training deck .
yeah , yeah , way ahead ofya .
cadet florin , watch your tail , son !
youpeople trythat kindofhot dogging in the field , andyou're space dust !
commander nebula .
ah , lightyear .
i got something i want you to see .
allright , we're crankin'it up to levelnine , people !
bring it on .
huh?
level nine?
commander , they're only rookies .
come on .
i train on level nine .
i know .
hey !
level ten .
huh?
oh .
oh .
oh , oh !
okay .
oh !
well , l i guess we couldn't expect a rookie to
uh !
it ain't over .
how did she do that?
she's from the planet tangeah .
ofcourse , tangean ghosting powers .
excellent .
yeah , let's see one ofzurg's robots walk through a wall .
ranger mira nova reporting for duty , sirs .
mira nova?
strange coincidence .
isn't that also the name ofthe heir to the tangean throne?
i met her once .
you saved my planet once .
buzz , meet your new partner .
partner?
sir , what you did for my people well , it inspired me tojoin .
no !
n no?
no what?
no partner .
too risky .
oh !
look , son , i know you're still torn up about warp .
but next time you're out there  and zurg aims for me?
what's to keep the princess from ending up like warp?
yeah , well , maybe it's the princess keepin 'you from endin 'up like warp .
okay , hello?
the princess has a name !
yeah , i'm sorry , prince mira , i work alone .
so you're gonna stop zurg all by yourself?
that's the general plan .
but regulations clearly state that
i know regulations !
i wrote halfofthem !
but as long as zurg is gunnin 'for me ... anybody close to me is gonna get caught in the cross fire .
noted .
but buzz , there's one thing you should know .
yes , sir?
you are not going out there without backup !
i'm sorry , commander , but from now on , buzz lightyear flies solo .
allpersonnelclearthe launch bay .

crystallic fusion modules neededonpad 14 .
hello .
i'm just cleaning the floor and stuff .
clean is good .
oh , that'sjust what i thought .
rocket away .
allpersonnelmay return to the launch bay .
wow !
an andromeda class star cruiser !
ambassadorescortpatrol isscheduledforlaunch at 0900 .
this isjust too cool .
you there !
the launch bay is for authorized personnel only !
i wasjust , um ugh i oh , man !
just like i figured .
guess what , pal .
you're through .
he's not through till i say so .
captain lightyear .
buzz !
ah , space dust .
this place is filthy ... and it goes right to the subatomic level .
that's why this young man is in here with his molecular mop .
carry on , custodian .
oh , yes , sir .
my mistake , sir .
as you were , corporal .
come on , booster .
this is the third time this week .
you know you're really not authorized to be in here , son .
oh , i know , but i like to look at the star cruisers .
i just want to be a space ranger so bad , buzz .
now , don't you worry .
you'll pass the entrance exam , booster .
you'vejust got to study the  space ranger mission manual?
oh , i am , sir !
i memorize one page every night .
i'm up to section five , subsection beta .
light speed limits .
more than just a good idea , it's the law .
outstanding .
oh , thanks , buzz .
buzzlightyearto science bay .
on my way .
gotta run , booster .
yes , sir !
uh , booster?
yes , sir?
at ease .
thanks , buzz .
good morning , lackeys !
where's my new henchman?
they are arming him now , sir .
does he have a flamethrower?
remember last time .
a flamethrower would have really come in handy .
tension feels about right .
ah , how are his reflexes?
not bad .
thanks .
a delightful blend of man and machine ... with just a naughty touch of lingonberry .
i shall call you agent z !
that's stupid .
my mother used to call me that !
you know he really , really likes that name .
yes , he's been saving it for a very evil henchman .
agent z?
love it .
especially the whole " z " thing .
and and and you know what?
we'll save a fortune on monogramming .
if i could just squeeze in here , yeah .
sir , your spy drone is in position .
yeah .
okay .
that'sjim crackin 'dandy !
come , agent z.
let us see if my spy drone can find this so called unimind .
the unimind !
we are one .
we are one .
i must have this mystical orb , this unimind !
launch an immediate assault on the planet ofthe little green men .
excellent .
a chance to use this .
ooh !
the flamethrower .
what's up , fellas?
we heard about your fight with commander nebula .
now , it wasn't a a fight .
it wasjust a professional disagreement ... and in time , he'll admit that i'm better offalone .
we have solved your partner problem .
not you guys too .
look , i can't have a partner problem , because i don't have a partner .
but x. r. is perfect foryou .
x. r.?
who's x. r.?
yes !
not who what .
witness the future ofspacejustice .
x. r. !
the experimental ranger .
x. r. reporting for duty .
kind ofshort , isn't he?
do ya think so?
that little robot wouldn't ... stand a chance against zurg's forces ofevil .
watch !
you're , uh , going somewhere with this?
ifzurg blows up x. r.
we can put him back together .
and commander nebula approved a robot ranger?
he hates robots .
well , he doesn't exactly know .
he does now !
oh , hello , commander .
so you went ahead and built that expendable ranger .
uh , experimental ranger .
unauthorized ranger !
uh ... well , technically , it was authorized by you .
we slipped it in with our vacation request .
craters .
they always get me that way .
i keep tellin 'them no bucket of bolts can stand up to a real ranger .
he's got ya there , fellas .
we thought ofthat .
artificial intelligence chip .
x. r. is programmed to watch and learn .
and he'll be learnin 'from the best you .
true .
but , uh , i don't know .
i don't know .
at least give him a test run as your new partner .
lightyear , i already told you !
ranger nova is your new partner .
why won't anybody listen to me?
no more partners !
but , buzz !
what's eatin 'them?
i've seen this before .
it's the mindlink .
evil !
zurg !
his dark forces invade our home world !
i'm on my way .
i'm on my way .
buzz lightyear mission log .
zurg's dark ...
shadow looms over the entire  buzz lightyear mission log .
zurg's dark shadow looms over the
could you not do that?
could you not do that?
the unimind !
the unimind !
the unimind !
quickly !
we must get to the unimind !
get below !
the unimind !
the unimind !
protect the unimind !
we are one .
we are united .
we are powerful !
we are afraid !
oh , no !
hornets , move in .
at ease , little green citizens .
star command is on thejob .
yea !
at ease , little green citizens .
star command is on thejob .
our work's not done yet , x. r. !
agent z to zurg .
they sent lightyear .
that's whylsentyou .
craters !
a new player .
we got 'im on the run .
we've got him on the run?
he's good .
but i'm better .
x. r. !
he's good , but i'm better .
you are learning .
now , watch this .
they never see this coming .
huh?
saw it coming .
x. r. !
gun !
x. r. !
gun !
x. r. !
system malfunction .
agent z to zurg .
the unimind's all yours .
you're good , but i'm better .
the unimind !
the unimind !
buzz lightyear to star command .
this is a priority one mission update .
the unimind has been captured ... and we've got a ranger down .
you can fix him , right?
can we?
i don't know .
we are not one .
but we shall try .
buzz lightyear personal log .
my brave little robotic partner had been blasted ... into a pile of trillium carbonic scrap .
and yet , the l. g. m. s were rebuilding him .
even without the unimind , those little green guys had the right stuff .
then came the wrong stuff .
their selection ofauxiliary gear was obviously nonregulation .
but perhaps there was a method to their madness .
maybe , just maybe .
no .
they had lost it .
wow .
they really need that uni ma call it .
i don't think they have any idea what they're doing any more , commander .
what is , uh , this thing?
uh , an arm?
told ya .
blast !
zurg knows the little green guys keep star command runnin '!
that stinkin 'bucket head .
he did this to cripple our operation .
no , commander .
ifthat's all zurg wanted ... he could have destroyed the unimind .
instead , he had his new lackey , agent z , steal it .
but why?
what's he gonna do with it?
i don't know exactly , but i believe that even now zurg is hatching ... his most diabolical scheme yet .
this is my most diabolical scheme yet .
assuming that the freak show , known as my staff ... can do one thing right !
ofcourse , my evil emperor , and , uh , uh ... who better to give you the good news than , uh , uh ...
brain pod percy !
i , uh , uh
okay , hi , uh , mr evil emperor .
how are you?
uh , you look terrif very sinister today .
we believe thatjust as the unimind connected all the l. g. m. s ... uh , it could , um , hopefully allow you to reach out ... and ensnare every innocent mind in the galactic alliance .
huh?
you know , a mind slave , evil puppet kind ofscenario .
you're telling me my plan .
i already know my plan .
i made up the plan .
it's my plan .
what i don't know is how close you are to accomplishing my plan !
yeah , kind of an outdoor voice there .
okay , naturally , the first step is to turn the unimind from good to evil .
but , um , heh , we don't have any idea how .
see , we're on the way
lamebrain !
ifyou want something turned evil ... turn it evil yourself .
that's what nana zurg always used to say to me ... and she was plenty evil .
evil overload !
nana zurg would be so proud .
allrangers to mission briefing room .
allrangers to mission briefing room .
hey , fellas .
something big going on?
sorry .
can't talk .
top secret .
oh , so , um , you guys need me to empty the , uh , wastebaskets or something?
sorry , booster .
this is space ranger business .
yeah , space ranger business .
i don't know what zurg's plannin 'on doin 'with the unimind ... but i plan on beatin 'him to the punch .
we're launching a full scale assault on planet z.
whoa !
full scale?
buzz , listen to your trusty partner when i say ... maybe we've overlooked a little thing i like to call negotiation .
x. r.?
now , follow me on this , buzz .
two words .
time share .
how many ofyou love it?
all right .
monday through wednesday , admittedly , the galaxy belongs to zurg .
but thursday through saturday , it's ours .
we alternate sundays .
what do you think?
sweet mother ofvenus .
what did you do to him?
we , uh , fixed him .
we , uh , think .
get that thing outta here !
what did i say?
come on .
you know the time share idea is solid , and you'rejealous .
where are you guys goin 'with the robot?
please .
experimental ranger .
uh , we were looking foryou , booster .
yeah .
we thought you could use some help .
here .
you'll love him .
i am lovable .
delta squadron will occupy zurg's fleet ... while gamma squadron attacks planet z itself .
this is no cakewalk .
it's a high risk operation .
uh , e excuse me , commander .
sorry to interrupt ... but i've been studying zurg's planetary defence matrix .
and i think a small , one man ship
could slip past the defences unnoticed .
exactly .
a single ranger could undermine zurg's evil operation from within .
and with the new alpha one prototype , i could slip right
wait a minute .
it was my idea .
i should go .
sorry , but you don't have the field experience ... to take on such a dicey assignment , princess .
princess?
i am a space ranger .
you know what?
you two really should be partners .
'cause you're both pigheaded show offs !
but , commander  zip it .
the alpha one is still an experimental spacecraft .
nobody's taking it !
we're doing this my way .
star command will launch a full assault on planet z at 0800 hours .
how long do we have to do this?
the cafeteria's a high traffic area .
this could take a while .
hey , here's an idea .
we ditch work and do something fun .
no way !
i would never shirk my duty .
huh .
buzz would be very disappointed .
buzz?
as in lightyear?
as ifthere's any other buzz .
you know , i used to be buzz lightyear's partner .
get out !
that's exactly what command nebula said .
now look at me .
hey , booster .
how would you like a v. i. p. tour of buzz lightyear's star cruiser?
that would be the coolest thing ever !
whoa , slim !
whoa !
i don't know about that , but it beats working .
follow me !
space ranger buzz lightyear to mission control .
ready to launch to infinity and
oh , come on , x. r. say it with me .
what?
oh , yeah .
to infinity and beyond !
to infinity and whatever .
beyond , yeah , right .
soon my zurgatronic megaray will be fully operational !
install the evil unimind !
now , load the crystallic fusion cell .
the zurgatronic megaray will use the unimind ... to spread my evil ... across the universe !
oh !
oh , yes !
you haven't won until ...
lightyear is out ofthe picture .
fusion cell loaded !
fire zurgatronic megaray !
firing zurgerrific ray .
zurgatronic , ya lack wit !
sorry .
zurgerrific's not bad , though .
let's file it for future use .
did you make sure that the plus end went to the plus part ... and the minus end went to the minus part?
oh !
that would do it , huh?
oh !
alll . g. m. maintenance checkshave been cancelleduntilfurthernotice .
rocket crockett to mission opsimmediately .
rocket crockett to mission opsimmediately .
going somewhere , princess?
wha oh , buzz !
well , hi .
how are ya?
uh
i was , uh , you know , just taking a little stroll , and i thought , uh
ranger mira nova , you were about to hijack the alpha one , weren't you?
why , i d yes , sir .
princess , report yourself to commander nebula at once .
i'm sorry .
i just wanted to help , you know?
and i thought this would be the best way
hey , wait a minute .
what are you doing down here?
well , l i am on a routine in inspection ofthe canooter valves .
and , uh , yep , yep , everything looks good up here .
you were about to hijack the alpha one .
oh , ofall the nerve !
report yourself to commander nebula .
mira , now is neither the time nor the place .
buzz , i just have one thing to say to you .
and what might that be?
good night .
tangean brain squeeze .
oh !
uh oh .
who authorized that launch?
it wasn't us , was it?
i know who .
it's the princess , commander .
she stole the alpha one to take on zurg by herself .
she beat ya to it , huh?
yeah , yeah , pretty much .
well , ranger nova is your partner .
better go get her , son .
yes , sir .
for the record , she is not my partner , sir .
whoosh !
whoosh !
look out for the asteroids , x. r.
yeah , whoosh , zoom .
whatever , booster .
sorry .
ranger lightyear .
buzz lightyear to the rescue !
listen .
somebody's comin '.
oh , no !
we shouldn't be here .
i'm gonna get fired ... prosecuted , convicted !
ya gotta hide me !
odd .
okay , husky bob , let's go .
you are clearforemergency liftoff .
roger that .
oh , come on !
whew !
he didn't see us .
see? just stick with x. r. and everything is a ok .
wait a minute .
zurgatronic megaray on line , evil emperor zurg .
you're sure this time , yes?
reasonably .
let's test it on something before we hit star command .
we need a target that won't , um , shoot back .
may i suggest rizone , my evil emperor?
the planet ofthe vegetarians , yes !
delicious suggestion , uh , number , um , 29 .
eh , how long have you been with my evil organization?
ooh , oh , let's see , uh , in total or just since i've been a brain in a jar?
uh , brain in a jar .
fouryears next week .
fascinating .
okay , then
now that you mention it .
i am overdue for a cost of living raise .
you know , when i gave up my body , certain promises were made .
i wasjust being polite !
i don't really care , all right?
all right .
now , unless anyone else wants ... to tell me his or her life story , can we shoot the big gun?
rizone .
um , more salad?
oh , i couldn't .
well , i'm offto meditate for galactic peace .
oh , isn't that lovely?
i can feel it !
i control every mind on the planet !
it worked !
evil rules !
oh , this is fun !
let's hit something else .
uh , batheous?
the fish faces?
test underwater effectiveness .
good point .
batheous .
another planet , and it's mine !
i'm not the man who knows the man !
i am the man !
about that raise , sir?
please !
once i enslave the universe , i won't need the likes ofyou .
it'll be all zurg all the time !
24 7 !
zurgie heaven !
alpha one , powerdownyourengines .
buzz , you knowmyplan can work .
icangetpastzurg's defences .
unfortunately , mira , the commander doesn't agree with us .
hey , hey , hey , hey , hey !
huh?
find anything?
bingo .
spare space suits .
slap one on ya , jet back to star command and no one's the wiser .
uh , x. r.?
slight problem .
oh , come on !
end ofthe line , princess .
ease offthose thrusters , mira .
you'lljust burn 'em out .
oh , craters !
ranger nova ... that was the most outrageous showboating stunt i've ever seen .
kind of reminds ya ofyourself , huh?
yeah , kind of .
this isn't going to work .
sure it will .
come on . just suck it in .
you can do it , big fella .
think thin .
that's the key .
uh , hello?
all is ready , my evil emperor .
target star command and fire !
and so ends star command .
ooh , i'm so evil !
i just gave myselfchills !
even my goose bumps have goose bumps !
i'm a bad boy !
what are you doing here?
yeah , buddy .
what are you doing here?
we want answers and we want them now .
i meant both ofyou .
how's that?
it's a complicated explanation , buzz .
i think it's best ... wejust sweep the whole incident under the rug .
and since we're a couple ofjanitors ...
i can promise you that's no problem .
i'm sorry , buzz .
is that a  red alert !
hey , guys , wait up !
what was that?
it's headed toward star command .
well , the station looks okay .
buzz lightyear to star command .
come in , star command .
i don't like this .
x. r. , report .
sensors indicate " spooky .
in fact , i'm going to have to go with " very spooky .
where is everyone?
what happened?
i mean , there's no sign ofa struggle .
my scanner is picking up some
lightyear !
how good ofyou tojoin us .
zurg?
in a manner ofspeaking .
ohh .
that's spooky .
you see , i used the unimind to link your fellow rangers to my evil .
and that'sjust the beginning .
soon , the entire galactic alliance ... will be under my control .
you know , as a robot , i'm not susceptible to mind control , so this really isn't an issue for me .
yeah , it'll be your issue when they rip you apart and sell you for scrap .
good point .
anybody got a plan?
here's one .
back to the ship , people !
" people "?
that does include me , right?
uh oh !
no , mira .
although currently possessed by the most powerful evil ... in the universe , they're still fellow rangers .
then how do we get past them?
looks like we've got us ... a high traffic area .
all right , let's wax 'em , big guy .
just push me not so fast , not so fast , not so fast !
ya hoo !
to the launch bay !
good work , people .
and robot?
and robot .
lightyear must not escape !
ifzurg had taken over ... every mind on star command , well ... that means we're the only space rangers left .
what do we do?
we've got to take the battle to zurg .
no need .
he's bringing it to us .
ohh !
i got a lot of red lights blinking over here .
i don't need those lights to tell me we're in trouble .
i had no idea a star cruiser could pull a move like that .
and neither did zurg .
i'll make a note of it .
we're surrounded !
you know , the guy's supposed to be some kind ofevil genius ... and the best he can come up with is a ventriloquist act .
what's next?
evil juggling?
farewell , lightyear .
they're retreating .
but why?
obviously , my caustic tongue cut 'em to the quick .
i'm getting a funny energy reading .
mira , check the hull .
we've got a bomb !
a bomb?
perfect .
at last .
for too long , lightyear has hounded me .
but no more .
buzz lightyear mission log .
by launching the alpha one at the precise moment ofdetonation ...
zurg believes us to be destroyed .
i feel i must pause for a moment ofsilence in honour of my ship .
oh , please , buzz .
it wasjust a hunk of metal .
okay , and you are?
in serious need ofsome personal space .
so , buzz , did zurg win?
not a chance , booster .
i've got zurg right where i want him .
yeah?
well , wherever he is , i'll bet he's got legroom .
as long as zurg thinks i'm dead he won't be looking for me ... and that gives me the advantage .
i never thought it would be so easy .
what?
the defeat ofstar command?
i always knew it was doable .
not that .
lightyear .
ah , yes , my dearly departed foe .
somehow , evil won't be quite as much fun without buzz lightyear to kick around .
okay , ranger nova , let's test that little theory ofyours .
so nobody's ever actually infiltrated planet z before?
never .
oh , man .
listen , a spacecraft this small won't be detected .
i'm positive .
you know , i'm , i'm i'm pretty i mean , you know , i'm not a hundred percent
blast !
the seeker drones are on patrol .
oh , thisjust gets better and better .
i can do this .
i just need a little elbow room !
uh , buzz , i think i sat on a button .
what button?
let me see .
emergency water landing .
oh , that wouldn't be so bad ifwe were over water !
what's gonna happen?
first , the crystallic fusion core deactivates , and then
oh , man !
blast !
rangers , condition status .
not good .
excellent .
let's roll .
what now?
that?
that's not a spacecraft .
it's obviously a weather balloon .
let's leave the brain work to those with the brains , shall we?
uh huh .
yeah .
okay .
the alpha one is a ok .
but it asks that we not do that again .
you three take the ship , find the planets that zurg hasn't hit yet ... and supervise immediate evacuations .
what what about zurg?
he's my problem .
he's everybody's problem .
mira .
there's only one way for me to finish this mission alone .
but buzz , that's against the rules .
in the star command mission manual , it clearly states ... that no ranger is to go into action without backup .
i think it's section six , subsection delta .
actually , it's section six , subsection gamma .
he's right , big guy .
subsection delta's the dress code .
incidentally , why can't we have nose rings?
because nose rings are for punks , little mister .
well , ifyou can take on zurg alone ...
i don't see why x. r. can't get a nose ring .
i wasjust asking a question .
i'm not the one getting a nose ring .
then who's getting a nose ring?
that's why buzz wants to ditch us !
i am not getting a nose ring .
nobody's getting a nose ring !
it's against the rules !
which , apparently , don't apply to you .
ofcourse they apply to me .
the rules apply to everyone .
great .
then you're not facing zurg alone , and we'll be your backup .
i want the three ofyou offthis planet now , and that's an order .
yes , sir !
yes , sir !
ranger nova .
yes , sir .
thankyou .
next target , and oh .
who haven't we perverted into a twisted reflection of my evil?
a few planets in the beta quadrant remain unperverted .
ah , bingo !
hey !
oh !
mother of pearl !
lightyear .
zurg .
by the authority ofstar command , i hearby place you under arrest .
not bad , lightyear .
i should've seen that one coming .
like i was sayin ', you're under arrest .
aw , come on , buddy .
that's no way to treat ... your partner .
warp?
surprised?
you're alive?
or am i dead?
no , you're not dead .
not yet , anyway .
but how?
the exploding moon .
convincing , wasn't it?
yeah , zurg's fireworks are really top shelf .
but , warp
agent z , please .
ofcourse !
amnesia !
no .
evil clone .
no .
android replica .
no !
okay , okay , it's so obvious .
zurg's mind control ray .
he got to you first .
actually , i went to him .
evil isjust so much more profitable than good , and more fun .
i don't believe it .
the warp darkmatter ...
i trained side by side with would not work ... for the most evil force in the universe .
look , lightyear , i've been on zurg's payroll since the academy .
once i got the l. g. m. s to spill the secret ofthe unimind ... the big z brought me on full time .
my name's darkmatter .
who's surprised here?
one ofstar command's finest , the perfect spy .
and i gave you a really nice eulogy .
he was not only a great ranger , but a great friend .
what a hoot !
lfonly you knew !
imisshim verymuch .
oh , one more time !
imisshim verymuch .
miss him now?
stop mocking me !
i'll admit that in the past ... you have been a most formidable foe .
but since you lost your dear partner , you've been offyour game .
buzz lightyear may end today ... but what i believe in will live on hope , freedom and justice .
oh , that's rich !
oh , please , please tell me you got that .
got it !
excellent !
add it to my collection .
besides , mr melodrama ...
i'm not going to kill you .
no .
no , i have a much more delicious idea .
i'm going to take the galaxy's greatest hero ... and turn him into me .
welcome to the team , partner .
this isn't my team , and you're not my partner .
buzz lightyear mission log , final entry .
what's he doing?
mission log .
he's a procedure nut .
as ifthere's gonna be anyone left to read his report .
ooh !
sent packing like a bunch offirst year rookies .
which , technically , we are .
idon't knowifanyone willbe left untaintedbyzurg's evil ... to receive this last chapter .
did i sit on another button?
it's buzz .
aslgo to my doom ...
doom?
ipause topaytribute to three ofthe best andthe brightest ...
to evercome out ofstarcommand .
that's me and two others !
i have taken a one man stand against darkness and depravity .
and i have failed .
i was wrong .
keep rolling .
this is priceless .
perhaps if i had taken a new partner ... or two or three
hot rockets !
did you hear that?
he needs us !
he actually admits he needs us .
we're comin ', buzz !
buzz lightyear , over and out .
target buzz lightyear .
okey doke .
you're the evil emperor .
megaray mega ready !
do it !
hot rockets !
see , this is where metal arms come in handy .
i don't wanna show off , but when you have to hold a heavy guy like
darkmatter , kill lightyear !
where?
have you blown a circuit?
aww !
stung by your own hornet , huh?
booster !
ohh !
sorry !
target the planet ofwidows and orphans !
you fiend !
there he is !
i knew that would get him .
your puny star command laser is pathetic !
let me show you a real weapon !
oh .
nice shot .
the key is to not pull the trigger , but squeeze it .
janitor driving !
get off !
look out !
buzz is hit .
rookies .
hey , isn't that buzz's dead partner?
eject !
whoa !
aren't you thejanitor?
yep .
oh , this is gonna be great for my rep .
mira , booster , x. r. , can anybody read me?
do you copy?
i can't make it in time .
it's up to you now .
good luck .
give it up , lightyear .
i win .
evil never wins .
afraid ofthe dark , zurg?
not today , zurg .
evil emperor zurg , by the authority ofstar command
section five , subsection zeta .
that's the one about the evil emperor .
you are under arrest !
like i said , evil never wins .
f firing .
hey .
you failed , lightyear !
with that final blast , i have enslaved ... every free world in the galactic alliance !
whereveryou go in the universe ... you will hear my voice mocking you !
evil rules !
oh !
we're not done yet .
booster , x. r. , get up top and take warp into custody .
mira , you're with me .
chain reaction !
she's gonna blow !
get back here !
hey , release me !
hey !
i'm zurg's number one agent !
now , there's something i wouldn't go boasting about .
what , you're gonna jump?
are you crazy?
buddy boy , we're on thejanitorial staff .
you're looking at a couple of risk takers .
it's true .
no !
don't be such a fraidy cat .
like we'd reallyjustjump .
mm kay , buzz , what are we going to actually do?
the l. g. m. mindlink was activated by a simple touch .
maybe , just maybe
you're doing it !
the power of good is a strong thing , mira .
but not strong enough .
blast !
thanks to zurg , the unimind is rotten to the core .
then let's get you to the core .
you're gonna ghost me?
buzz !
to infinity and beyond !
ah !
lightyear !
no !
my plan !
my galaxy !
unimind wave impact in three seconds .
curse you , buzz lightyear !
i'm going in !
he's a goner !
thanks for the lift , mira .
anytime , sir .
i hope the unimind still works foryou guys .
we are one .
our mindlink has been restored .
all is as it was .
to infinity and beyond !
i can't believe we captured agent z.
i can't believe he turned out to be buzz's dead partner who wasn't really dead .
yeah , that too .
uh huh .
amazing !
easy , fellas .
i know i've exceeded all performance expectations .
it's not that , x. r. you're almost human .
so many character flaws !
okay .
you know what?
let'sjust say " amazing " and leave it at that !
well , lightyear , you managed to save the universe again .
it wasn'tjust me , sir .
zurg almost won .
in fact , he would have , except i had backup .
well , ofcourse you had backup .
'cause everybody needs backup .
it's in the manual .
section six , subsection gamma .
got the message , guys .
so , who's your partner gonna be , son?
don't worry , commander .
i've made my choice .
team lightyear reporting for duty , sir !
