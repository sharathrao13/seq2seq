that's the ugliest thing i've ever seen in my whole life .
it certainly is .
who sent it?
that's strange , it doesn't say .
who could've come from?
i don't like it .
it's staring at me .
it's probably one of your uncle's jokes .
i don't think it's funny at all .
darling , i'm just going to have a shower .
i'll be there in a minute .
claudia , i told you not to leave your toys laying about .
good god , you are hideous .
claudia?
what?
i had a bond with you , young lady .
we had an agreement , didn't we?
didn't we?
but daddy , i didn't leave it there .
ln a civilized society , our word is our bond .
i don't know what you're talking about .
just because it's your birthday , doesn't mean you can ...
richard?
richard , what was that?
you killed my mommy and daddy .
and now you're pissing your pants , you're pissing your pants ... your pissing your pants !
wake up !
you're pissing your pants !
and now , ladies and gentlemen ... what you've all been waiting for !
shitface ... and the greatest ventriloquist in europe !
the psychotic psychs !
come on !
this grotesque abomination ... is not even anatomically correct .
don't laugh , it's a serious condition .
six years ago , i found him in a cemetery back in the us ... the little fucker tried to rip me from hell .
i was trying to give you a hug .
i don't know much about myself .
i know i'm an orphan , i know i'm a freak ... and of course , i know that i'm japanese .
but why do i have such terrible nightmares?
filled with rate and blood and guts .
i'm not like that at all .
i would even hurt a fly .
there it goes , back to his family .
i envy him .
sometimes , i wonder about my own parents .
were they zen masters?
did they serve the emperor? .
sometimes i wonder what my mom and dad were really like .
so , you don't believe in santa claus .
trust me honey , tonight i'm gonna make you believe .
wait to see what santa is bringing you , you naughty girl .
no , i can hear you fine , you're not breaking up .
sheila i just said , you're not breaking up .
you're breaking up with me?
wait !
you're breaking up with me on christmas's eve?
sheila , you've got to be fucking kidding me !
that's just great .
i knew it !
you're not real !
you were never real !
you know what that kind of disappointment can do to somebody?
you have any idea how that can fuck with your mind?
fuck with your mind?
fuck with your mind?
fuck with your mind?
fuck with your mind?

for sticking to your diet .
thank you .
what's going on in the world today?
julia roberts is getting 25 million for her next film .
i'm so tired of hearing about julia roberts .
you know , i should've played erin brockovich .
i could've done it without the wonderbra .
julia stole that part right out from under me .
you know how?
she slept with the director , that's what i think .
jennifer , you know that's not true .
how come i don't ever get any of the good roles anymore?
how come nobody takes me seriously?
nice tits .
thank you .
look at me , i'm an oscar nominee , for christ's sake ... and now i'm fucking a puppet .
got no fan mail , no paparazzi , no stalkers .
there must be something i'm right for .
let's see ...
hip hop superstar , turned director redman ... is still looking for the right actress to take the female lead ... in his upcoming bible epic .
that sounds good .
what's the role?
virgin mary .
what's so funny?
nothing .
it's perfect !
it's just what i need to reinvent myself .
the virgin mary .
i always loved the way she wears robes ... her hair off her face , kinda like this .
joan , get morty on the phone ... and tell him i need to have a meeting with this redman right away .
that's a wrap for access hollywood reporting from hollywood .
for as you can see , chucky and tiffany are alive and well .
you can catch their movie in theaters next halloween .
thank you , chucky .
fuck you very much .
i'm not orphan after all .
well ... you were shit last night ...
you're gonna have to be more scary .
scary?
let's rehearse , shall we?
hello .

give in to your natural impulses , or else i'll have to ... fire your arm?
hey !
come here !
come here !
come here !
mary , you're truly a vision of solid innocence .
unique among all women , as pure as the virgin snow ... but i ask , what is troubling you?
joseph , husband , there's been a miracle .
as i stand before you , i must tell you ...
i'm with child .
but mary , how could this be?
ln accordance with god's whishes , we never lay together ... as man and wife .
yes it is true , and i beg you that you believe when i tell you ...
i've never lain with any man at all .
do you believe me , joseph?
do you?

yes , yes i do .
you're great .
you're super .
thank you , mr. man .
could i call you red?
there's a whole lot different ways i can do it , not just the way you saw .
i can do it faster , i can do it slower , i could do it as a rap .
no .

thanks for coming by anyway .
i'm a huge , huge fan ...

who is your first choice?
julia roberts .
but thanks for coming by anyways .
listen red ...
i've been giving a lot of thought to this project ... and i have a lot of interesting ideas about the character ... and i was thinking maybe ... you'd like to discuss it in a more intimate setting .
just the 2 of us .
well , i didn't know you were that passionate about the role .
yes , very passionate .
so , shall we say , my place ... eight 'o clock?

what did i tell you?
a beautiful little girl .

that's my boy !
it's just that he hasn't had his growth spurt yet .
don't worry about it , son .
you're a later bloomer , that's all .
and it's high time that you had a real name .
let's see , i'm gonna call you ...
glen .
glen?
what kind of name is that for a girl?
don't listen to him , honey .
from now on , your name is ...
glenda .

you look so real !
you're cuter than my last boyfriend .
i think we make a lovely couple .
jennifer !
mrs. tilly !
were you having an affair with him?
i don't know what you're talking about .
pete peters , celebrities reveal .
jennifer , what did you see?
you want me to draw a picture?
somebody give her a piece of paper !
i'm not going to draw a picture .
don't feel bad , you're an actress , not an artist , uh?
what were you doing when you saw the body?
no comments .
jennifer , i love you .
jennifer , i love you .
ls it true that you and redman talked about ... you starring in his new movie?
yes , as a matter of fact , i ...
can i have your autograph?
okay , sure .
we've heard about your obsession with chocolate .
hey , hold on , you forgot the head .
excuse me , excuse me .
jennifer , how old are you really? .
paparazzi scum bag !
what year were you born?
i want the set of the film , okay?
sure .
what are you hiding?
are you okay?
i am now .
so are you a pair of ninja assassins?
are you hit men for the yakuza?
we're not from japan .
we're from jersey .
just think .
jennifer tilly is playing me in a movie .
it's absolutely perfect casting .
but that voice?
i know , she sounds just like an angel .
now i've got it all figured it out .
i'm gonna transfer my soul into jennifer ... and you're gonna transfer your soul into redman .
i'm down with that .
we'll diss these plastic bodies once and for all ... and we'll be hollywood's hottest couple !
what about me?
don't worry , glenda .
i've got that figured it out too .
you are going to be a real life girl .
boy .
how?
well , i'm not getting pregnant again , i'll tell you that much .
my mother always told me ...
once is a blessing , twice is a curse .
that would explain your sister .
the only sensible option is a surrogate mother .
i have something important ...
hold on a second , sweetheart .
hello?
what are you doing?
i'm busy .
i do have a life , you know?
turn on the news .
we have discovered the victim's body .
as of yet there's no official confirmation ... as to whether or not mrs. tilly is a suspect
jesus !
can you believe it?
are you okay?
i've had better days .
listen joan , i need you to do something for me .
i need you to get me a bottle of champagne ... and bring it by my house .
what for? .
i've got a big night tonight .
tonight?
with who?
redman .
jennifer , what are you up to?
thank you , joan .
come on , stan .
it's just business .
he'll be outta there by midnight .
oh my god !
she's a complete slut !
good night , glenda .
sleep tight .
leave it on .
oh sweetie .
there's nothing to be scared of .
your dad and i will be right here .
why do you kill people?
excuse me?
why do you kill?
it's a hobby , really .
it helps us relax .
am i going to be a killer?
of course !
it's been a family tradition for generations !
but violence is bad , isn't it?
they said so on tv .
not violence .
violins .
violins are bad .
that scrutchy music is gonna ruin the godamn country .
chucky , glenda is right .
it's time we owned up to it .
we have a problem with killing .
i don't have a " problem " with killing .
i like a little killing now and then .
what's wrong with that?
killing is an addiction like any other drug .
but we're parents now .
we have to set a good example .
let's quit , chucky .
right now !
you have got to be kidding .
promise me , chucky , no more killing .
no .
chucky .
no , no ...
no more killing !
no , no ...
we can't do it anymore !
no , no ...
we have the future to think of !
no , no !
we have a child !
fine !
alright already !
i promise .
thank you , doll baby .
you're a sweetheart .
now we really will be the perfect family .
did you hear that?
maybe you should forget the director and fuck the exterminator instead .
so how do i look?
never mind .
jennifer , this is beneath you .
think about what you're doing .
what the people are gonna say?
who cares what people will say?
don't you see how evil this is?
i don't wanna hear it .
you're prostituting yourself so you can play the virgin mary .
joan , i don't wanna hear it .
this is so evil .
you're going to hell .
no , hell would be ending up on " celebrity fear factor " ... in a worm eating contest with ann and nicole smith .
which you'd win .
he's here .
let yourself out the back .
and while you're at it , leave your key on the counter .
what are you saying?
you think i'm so disgusting ... you think i'm going to hell .
i'm only trying to survive here , joan .
god knows i wouldn't wanna drag you down with me .
i'm saying you're fired .
i'm gonna get that ass ...
now in artificial insemination , timing is everything ... so you have to hurry .
that shouldn't be a problem for you .
yeah , just don't let that player get into her pants .
i don't want him touching my woman ...
until i'm him , and you're her .
right .
hey , aren't you gonna give me a hand here?
too tall .
lesbos !
done her .
here we go !
come to papa !
cheers !
you know , i wasn't bullshitting when i told you i was a fan .
that's so sweet , redman .
which of my films is your favorite?
that movie where you and that chick were making out .
bound " .
everybody likes that one .
you're still in touch with her?
gina?
yeah , we're friends .
close friends .
very close friends .
maybe the three of us can hang out together sometime .
i'd really like that a lot .
okay .
i'll see if i can make it happen .
the bottom is up , baby .
redman , i was wondering ... what's gonna take to make you seem me as a virgin?
well , you tell me !
a masturbating midget?
get it , mini me !
sweet jesus !
god bless the little people !
i don't know if i can do this?
why not?
what will people say?
fuck what people will say !
you know what i'm saying?
this was meant to be , for real .
you know how i know?
'cause the man upstairs told me so .
really?
hell yeah !
mel gibson ain't the only one god's been talking to in hollywood .
and he personally told me , that you was my virgin .
what the hell?
pig !
and you should be ashamed yourself .
where's your self respect?
you know what my mother used to say about dirty girls?
she said " you can always smell it on the girls who sell it " .
by the way , can i have your autograph?
i'm a big fan .
what am i supposed to do with this?
mrs. tilly , i know you're frightened .
you're probably even wondering if you've gone completely insane .
but i promise you , tomorrow you're going to wake up ... and this will all seem just like a bad dream .
ln the mean time ... we can do this the easy way , or the hard way .
it's really up to you .
no wonder the girl is always in trouble .
check it out .
look at the size of his feet .
you know what they say .
geez , she's fat .
i can't believe it , she's not even pregnant yet .
paparazzi scum bag !
looks like you've got everything under control .
i'll just leave you to it .
motherhood is so beautiful .
no , no ...
sorry , just messing with you .
what time is it?
time to get dressed .
we're gonna have our own boys 'night out , just you and me .
how does that sound?
where are we going?
hunting .
i can't see anything .
maybe we should slow down?
now , you're doing great !
son of a bitch !
up yours , asshole !
what?
not you , son .
come on , floor it !
ops !
i did it again !
jesus christ !
no !
oughta a boy !
no , i didn't ...
and i thought you weren't ready , kid !
you're a fucking natural !
but he hit the shelf !
and don't worry about your mother , it'll be our little secret .
say " cheese " .
good morning .
hi .
we must have really gotten wild last night .
redman , did we ...?
you don't remember?
no , it's all blur .
what about you?
i remember you screaming a lot .
i seem to remember that too .
i have that effect on women .
really?
yeah .
wait , i do remember .
i had the strangest dream .
i dreamt my guardian angel came to me .
she had the sweetest voice i've ever heard .
she told me to respect myself ... and then she asked for my autograph .
let 'see , step number one , admit i have an addiction .
okay , check .
step number two , give myself over to a higher power?
whatever .
here we go .
step number nine : the recovering addict ... must make amendments to anyone he or she has harmed .
hello?
good morning . is this ruth bailey?
speaking .
the widow of robert bailey?
yes , who is this?
mrs. bailey ... my name's tiffany ray .
you don't know me , but a few years ago i killed your husband .
and i'm so very sorry .
ls this some kind of sick joke?
no , i'm completely serious .
but i want you to know ...
i'm recovering now and i've put all of that behind me .
i don't know who you are , but ...
thank you mrs. bailey , have a nice day .
i feel better already .
good morning , stan .
what is so important you wanted to tell me?
well , the things is , jennifer ...
i'm sorry , i don't know what's got into me .
so you were saying ...
forget it .
okay .
now , let's see ... what should we do today?
i'm pregnant .
redman , i said i'm pregnant .
congratulations .
who's the baby's daddy?
don't even look at me .
i haven't slept with anyone else ... to advance my career lately .
who are you kidding?
it's true , redman , look .
i know i come off all sluty , but that's for my image .
you think anyone would cast me in these sexy roles ... if they knew i hadn't been laid in a year?
i haven't even slept with my driver yet ... and i think he really likes me .
that's all very touchy and shit , but i'm telling you it can't be me .
why not?
i had a vasectomy as soon as i got to hollywood .
i ain't no idiot .
that's impossible , because ...
hey , jennifer .
i hate to break it to you ... but i can't hire you if you're pregnant .
that's ridiculous .
the character is pregnant .
i know , but i have a very specific vision of mary .
what can i say?
she's gotta be hot .
that pig !
recovery hotline .
yes , i'm in recovery .
and i'm afraid i'm going to have a slip .
can you get to a meeting?
no , it's really not an option .
i just freak everybody out .
don't be so hard on yourself .
we're not here to judge you .
what's your name?
tiffany .
listen to me , tiffany .
i know what you're going through .
you do?
yes , i do . ln fact , i'm gonna let you in a little secret .
just last week i had a slip .
really?
yeah , and believe me , it was not pretty .
it never is , is it?
no .
ln fact it took me three hours just to clean up the mess .
oh god , don't remind me .
but i'm not beating myself over it .
you know why , tiffany? .
why?
because rome wasn't built in a day .
you're right .
you're absolutely right .
hello?
speaking .
who's this?
i understand who you are , i just don't know how you got my number .
because it's a private number .
pete peters?
yeah , i saw him yesterday .
i don't have any relationship with him .
he's a paparazzi who started taking pictures of me ... in compromising positions .
redman is a director ...
oh yeah ... he's a rapper too ... he's a rapper director , okay? .
bye bye .
jennifer .
do you mind?
i'm on the phone .
there's been another murder .
what?
i told where i was .
i was right here all night with redman .
what?
i don't ...
you're not telling me i'm a suspect , are you?
okay .
alright .
i'm on my way .
i'm leaving .
you can let yourself out .
by the way redman , drop dead .
glenda , honey , everything is okay .
it was just a little slip .
no need to tell your daddy .
it'll be our little secret , okay?
it's " d " day here in san quentin .
who would've thought it would ever come to this?
they're executing martha stewart this morning .
i don't think i can take nine months of this shit .
silly chucky .
it's a voodoo pregnancy .
it's accelerated .
how accelerated?
it's 102, 7 kiss fm , la's number one music station .
ryan seacrest , ally kay " i don't know if i can't take it " on the way .
we have bad weather on the way , la , hollywood .
bad weather? .
we're not used to bad weather .
no , we're not .
i'm pretty sure it's gonna affect my whole life .
i'd like to hear more reports on the weather ...
this is joan .
joan , i'm fat .
you're not fat .
no , i'm fat , i'm huge !
for the love of mary , i'm pregnant .
oh my god .
no , i should've listened to you .
you said it was evil and i was going to hell .
you're right and now god is punishing me .
my god . ls it redman's?
no , it's definitely not redman's .
what?
what?
it's definitely not redman's .
what an asshole !
what makes you say that?
say what?
that redman's is an asshole .
i didn't say , you did .
no i didn't .
so he's not an asshole?
yes he is .
joan , will you stop doing that?
doing what?
lmitating , i don't sound like that !
yes you do !
i do !
joan , shut up !
there's something wrong with me , i'm pregnant , i ...
jennifer , what's wrong?
nothing , i'm fine .
i heard you scream .
i can still hear you screaming .
it's just , " bound " is on cable .
gina gershon is fingering me .
i love this movie , don't you?
jennifer?
yeah , that's really interesting , but i gotta go .

jennifer?
too tight?
yes .

what the hell is going on in here?
she came on to me .
help me !
somebody help me !
shut up , asshole !
somebody help me !
somebody help me !
what the hell is this?
we had an agreement , chucky !
we decided , for the sake of our child ... we weren't gonna do this shit anymore .
no , you decided !
just like you decided our son was a girl .
he is a girl !
he's a boy , godamn it !
and he's the most promising killer i've ever seen .
you should've been there , tiff .
you would've been so proud of him .
i want a girl !
i want a boy !
you're tearing me apart !
what about what i want?
what?
what?
doesn't what i want mean anything at all?
okay , interesting .
tell us .
what do you want , sweet face?
i think i want to be a boy .
yes ! ln your face , lady !
but being a girl would be nice too .
well , which is it?
i'm not sure .
sometimes i feel like a boy ... sometimes i feel like a girl .
can i be both?
well , some people ...
no way !
but one thing i do know for sure .
i don't want to be a killer .
glenda , glen , whatever .
i'm so proud of you .
no matter what happens ... we'll deal with it together , as a family .
okay , tiff san .
wait a minute !
i'm not gonna let you poison our son's mind ... with your touchy feely twelve step bullshit .
lf you two don't wanna kill anymore , that's your loss .
but don't look down your noses at me .
i'm not ashamed to be a killer , i'm proud of it .
it's not an addiction , it's a choice .
and it's not something that you should have to hide in the closet .
oh dear !
oh god !
well , well , well ...
looks like ms. high and mighty ain't so perfect after all .
it was just a little slip .
rome wasn't built in a day , you know?
besides , the fucker really had it coming .

we won't get another chance .
what are you waiting for , chucky?

everybody shut up !
i've had it !
that's it !
there's a limit to how much i can take .
what are you talking about?
look around you , tiff .
this is nuts !
and i have a very high tolerance for nuts .
lf this is what it takes to be human ... then i'd rather take my chances as a supernaturally possessed doll ... it's less complicated .
you can't be serious .
as a heart attack .
think about it .
what's so great about being human anyway?
you get sick , you get old , you can't get it up anymore .
i'm not looking forward to that .
honey , i wanna be jennifer tilly .
i wanna be a star .
and i don't wanna be your chauffer .
as a doll , i'm fucking infamous !
i'm one of the most notorious slashers in history .
and i don't wanna give that up !
i'm chucky , the killer doll !
and i dig it !
i have everything i want .
a beautiful wife .
a multi talented kid .
this is who i am , tiff .
this is me !
chucky , i don't know what the fuck you're talking about ...
i don't know who the fuck you are anymore .
but it's not enough for me .
i want more .
what are you saying?
it's over .
we've gotta get out of here , sweet face .
i'm leaving you , chucky , and i'm taking the kid .
nobody leaves me !
nobody !
no !
no !
jennifer , i love ...
stan tell me , tell me ...
jesus !
oh my god !
my babies !
i just wanna know where they are .
they're fine , jennifer .
they're in the maternity ward .
alright ...
the important thing for you ... to think about now is getting well so you can get on with your career .
i don't care about my career , i want my babies .
i'm working on it jennifer , but you're not making it easy .
i already talked to the cops , they cleared me .
they know that you're not a killer ... they didn't say you were mentally competent .
what do you expect after the story you told?
it's true .
i suggest from now on you keep that to yourself .
we'll talk later .
try to get some sleep .
wish me luck , sweet face .
mommy is gonna be a star .
i can't think of a thing to say .
fuck it !
give me the power , i beg of you .
switch !
switch !
switch !
switch !
nobody leaves me !
nobody !
what can i say?
honey ... be a good girl ... or boy , whatever .
don't make the same mistakes your mom and dad made .
specially your dad .
let's go .
glenda?
no , dad .
it's me , your boy .
your chipper filled block .
are you proud of me now , daddy?
are you?
oughta boy , kid !
oughta boy !
glen , there , there .
it's alright .
it's alright .
you're gonna be alright .
there , there .
honey , it's alright .
yesterday , she gave him a bloody nose and took pictures for showing .
and i'm pretty sure she's been taking money from my purse .
that's ridiculous .
glen is an angel , an absolute dream .
but glenda ... she's a bad girl , mrs. tilly .
a very bad girl .
i'm not listening to this .
i hate that thing .
some of the kids wanna see her .
mrs. tilly ...
what?
i'm afraid of her .
fulvia , it's only a doll .
i was talking about glenda .
fulvia , just exactly are you trying to say?
i can't work here anymore .
what?
i'm sorry , i just can't .
lf you only saw the way she looks at me with such ... hate .
alright fulvia , if that's what you want .
we'll miss you .
thank you , mrs. tilly .
god bless .
mom got her wish .
she's a bright shining star .
now we're the perfect family .
i've learned a lot about myself .
i know i'm not alone .
i know i'm not a freak .
and even though we had our differences ...
i know my dad really loved me .
glen sweetheart , come over here .
sweetheart look , here's another one .
who is it from , mommy?
i don't know .
let's see .
