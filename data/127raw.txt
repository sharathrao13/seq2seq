there was this turk who fucked up and was into milo for 30, 000 .
so i had to go out there .
i'd been there a few times . . . and asked for the money nicely .
ln the end i had to go out there with a knife .
i stuck it into his knees and tore it up , so the kneecap came out .
i'll tell you , frank , i think a lot about doing something else .
just leaving this all behind .
what would you do?
milo's a good cook , right?
especially cakes .
but i'm a good cook , too .
shish kebab .
that's my specialty .
you gotta try it sometime .
i get special spices for it .
there's nothing else like it .
i mean it , i'm thinking about opening a restaurant .
i haven't told anyone but you , not even milo .
it's top secret .
but it's got to be the right place .
ln town?
yeah , if i can make it all happen .
then milo can deliver the desserts .
don't tell me you like that stuff .
no way . . .
he can't bake .
he doesn't eat them himself .
i know why .
frank . . .
do you have the money or not?
i thought we agreed . . .

i can get it on the first .
i need it now , not on the first .
don't touch me !
let's see some fuckin 'money .
you've owed me 52 for a long time .

you think it's a joke?
it's not a game anymore .
calm down .
lf you don't help me , i can't help you .
i need it now .
you used to play with my brother .
does your brother have the money?
then how can he help?
he'll rip your kneecaps out if you don't pay up .
what am i gonna do with your watch?
deal with it , joakim .
it's not my money .
i can't help you anymore .
take it easy . . .

fuckin 'paki lover . . .
it's my money , do you understand?
can you get the money now?

then i have an idea . . .
you can get the money at the bank .
he can't rob a bank .
anyone can rob a bank .
he can't even hold that thing .
it's 3 : 45 , how can he rob a bank?
that's it , the problem's solved .
he can't rob a bank , he doesn't have the balls .
we just have time .
what bank do we rob?
i don't care .
what bank do you use?
no , he can't rob his own bank . . .
there's nothing else around .
we'll do the first one we see .

lf you popped one of us , the other would've blown your brains out .
it's time to go .
