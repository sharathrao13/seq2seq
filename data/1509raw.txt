three billion human lives ended on august 29 , 1997 .
the survivors of the nuclear fire ... called the war " judgment day .
they lived only to face a new nightmare ... the war against the machines .
the computer which controlled the machines , skynet ... sent two terminators back through time .
their mission : to destroy the leader of the human resistance .
john connor , my son .
the first terminator was programmed to strike at me ... in the year 1984 ... before john was born .
it failed .
the second was set to strike at john himself ... when he was still a child .
as before , the resistance was able to send a lone warrior ... a protector for john .
it was just a question of which one of them would reach him first .
i need your clothes , your boots and your motorcycle .
you forgot to say please .
get him off me !
pull it out !
take it .
can't let you take the man's wheels , son .
now , get off before i put you down .
that's it , goddamn it .
r 31 david , sherman code 6 ... at the sixth street bridge and santa fe on electrical disturbance .
ten four , r 31 david .
connor , john
john , get in there and clean up that pigsty of yours .
your foster parents are kind of dicks , huh?
i swear , i have had it with that goddamn kid .
he won't even answer me anymore .
honey , move .
would you get off your butt and help me?
todd !
what?
he hasn't cleaned that room of his in a month .
oh , it's an emergency .
hang on .
i'll get right on it .
come on .
get your ass inside .
do what your mother tells you .
she's not my mother , todd .
this next patient is interesting .
i've been following the case for years .
a 29 year old female ... diagnosed as acute schizo affective disorder .
the usual indicators : depression , anxiety , violent acting out ... delusions of persecution .
the delusional architecture is fairly unique .
she believes that a machine called the terminator ... which looks human , was sent back through time ... to kill her .
that's original .
and also that the father of her child ... was a soldier sent back to protect her .
he was from the future too .
the year 2029 , if i remember correctly .
and here we are .
morning , sarah .
good morning , dr. silberman .
how's the knee?
fine , sarah .
she stabbed me in the kneecap ... with my pen a few weeks ago .
repeated escape attempts .
let's move on , shall we?
i don't like to see the patients disrupting their rooms like this .
see she takes her thorazine .
sure .
i'll take care of it .
are you the legal guardian of john connor?
that's right , officer .
what's he done now?
could i speak with him , please?
you could if he were here .
he took off on his bike this morning .
he could be anywhere .
do you have a photograph of john?
yeah .
hold on .
gonna tell me what this is about?
i just need to ask him a few questions .
he's a good looking boy .
do you mind if i keep this picture?
no , go on .
there was a guy here this morning looking for him too .
yeah , a big guy on a bike .
has that got something to do with this?
i wouldn't worry about him .
thanks for your cooperation .
please insert your stolen card now .
pln number .
hurry up .
this is taking too long .
go , baby .
all right .
pln number 9003 .
where'd you learn this stuff from?
from my mom .
my real mom , i mean .
withdraw 300 bucks .
come on , baby .
come on !
yes !
hey , it worked .
all right .
easy money .
come on !
yes !
piece of cake .
ls that her?
yes .
she's pretty cool , huh?
no , she's a complete psycho .
that's why she's at pescadero .
it's a mental institute .
she tried to blow up a computer factory but got shot and arrested .
no shit .
she's a total loser .
come on .
let's go spend some money .
it's like a giant strobe light ... burning right through my eyes .
somehow i can still see .
oh , god .
we know the dream's the same every night .
why do i have to ...
please continue .
children look like burnt paper .
black .
not moving .
and then the blast wave hits them .
and they fly apart like leaves .
dreams ... of cataclysm , the end of the world ... are very common .
it's not a dream , you moron .
it's real .
i know the date it happens .
i'm sure it feels real to you .
on august 29 , 1997 ... it's gonna feel pretty fuckin 'real to you too !
anybody not wearing two million sunblock is gonna have a real bad day .
get it?
god , you think you're safe and alive .
you're already dead .
everybody !
him .
you .
you're dead already .
this whole place , everything you see is gone !
you're the one living in the dream , 'cause i know it happened !
it happened !
i feel much better now .
clearer .
yes , your attitude has been ... much improved lately .
it's helped me to have a goal ... something to look forward to .
what is that?
well , you said ... that if i showed improvement after six months ... you would transfer me to the minimum security wing ... and i could have visitors .
well , it's been six months ... and ...
i was looking forward to seeing my son .
i see .
let's go back to what you were saying about those terminator machines .
now you think they don't exist?
they don't exist .
i know that now .
but you've told me on many occasions about how you crushed one ... in a hydraulic press .
if i had , there would have been some evidence .
they would have found something at the factory .
i see .
so you don't believe anymore that the company covered it up?
no .
why would they?
let's try a new position right there .
mr. dyson?
the materials team is running another ...
mr. dyson .
yes?
the materials team is running another series this afternoon .
you have to sign for the ... it .
you have to sign it out .
okay .
i'll get it .
i know i haven't been here long , but i was wondering if you know ...
know what?
if you know where 'it 'came from .
i asked them the same question once .
you know what they told me?
don't ask .
good morning , mr. dyson .
how's it going?
insert key .
left on three .
two , one , turn .
how are the wife and kids?
great .
thanks .
so what do you think , doctor?
haven't i shown improvement?
well , sarah , here's the problem .
i know how smart you are .
you're just telling me what i want to hear .
i don't think you really believe what you're telling me today .
if i put you in minimum security , you'll just try to escape again .
you have to let me see my son .
please .
he's in great danger .
he's naked without me .
if i could make a phone call ...
i'm afraid not .
not for a while .
i don't see any choice but to recommend to the review board ... that you stay here for another six months .
i'll kill you , you son of a bitch !
you son of a bitch !
ten ccs of sodium amobarbital , stat !
you don't know what you're doing !
get some restraints in here now !
you don't know what you're doing !
model citizen .
you just missed him .
he was here 15 minutes ago .
he was going to the galleria .
yeah .
the galleria?
i'm gonna get some quarters .
i'll be back , all right?
oh , no !
girls , do you know john connor?
hey , do you know this guy?
nah , i don't know him .
john .
not now .
there's this cop scoping for you .
check it out .
he's right over there .
split , man .
just go .
yeah .
i saw that kid ...
you're not supposed to be in here !
get down .
mister , are you all right?
you all right?
come on !
goddamn !
okay , time out .
stop the bike .
time out .
come on , stop the bike .
holy shit .
now , don't take this the wrong way .
you are a terminator , right?
yes .
cyberdyne systems , model 101 .
holy shit .
you're really real .
i mean ...
you're like a machine underneath , right?
but alive outside?
i'm a cybernetic organism .
living tissue over metal endoskeleton .
this is intense .
get a grip , john .
okay .
you're not here to kill me .
i figured that part out for myself .
so what's the deal?
my mission is to protect you .
yeah?
who sent you?
you did .
thirty five years from now , you reprogrammed me ... to be your protector here , in this time .
oh , this is deep .
so this other guy , he's a terminator like you , right?
not like me .
a t 1000 , advanced prototype .
more advanced than you are?
yes .
a mimetic poly alloy .
what the hell does that mean?
liquid metal .
where are we going?
we have to get out of the city immediately and avoid the authorities .
i gotta stop by my house .
i wanna pick up some stuff .
negative .
the t 1000 would definitely try to reacquire you there .
you sure?
i would .
look , todd and janelle are dicks ... but i gotta warn'em .
shit .
you got a quarter?
hello .
janelle , it's me .
john?
ls everything all right?
are you guys okay?
sure , honey , everything's okay .
are you all right?
yeah , i'm fine .
john , it's late .
i was beginning to worry about you .
if you hurry home , we can sit down and have dinner together .
i'm making beef stew .
something's wrong .
she's never this nice .
where are you?
what the hell is the goddamn dog barking at?
hey , shut up , you worthless piece of shit !
the dog's really barking .
you were gonna tell the kid to get rid of that mutt .
john , it's late .
please don't make me worry .
could he already be there?
are you okay?
i'm right here .
i'm fine .
are you sure you're all right?
what's the dog's name?
max .
hey , janelle .
what's wrong with wolfie?
i can hear him barking .
ls he okay?
wolfie's fine , honey .
wolfie's just fine .
where are you?
your foster parents are dead .
i need a minute here .
you're telling me that this thing can imitate anything it touches?
anything it samples by physical contact .
get real .
it could disguise itself as a pack of cigarettes?
no , only an object of equal size .
why not just become a bomb or something to get me?
it can't form complex machines .
guns and explosives have chemicals , moving parts .
it doesn't work that way .
but it can form solid metal shapes .
like what?
knives and stabbing weapons .
these were taken by a video surveillance camera ... at the west highland police station in 1984 .
he killed 17 police officers that night .
men with families ... children .
these were taken at a mall in reseda ... today .
miss connor , we know you know who this guy is .
i just sat here and told you that your son is missing ... that the foster parents have been murdered .
we know this guy's involved .
doesn't that mean anything to you?
don't you care?
we're wasting our time .
let's go .
sorry , guys .
she's grown more disconnected from reality as time goes on .
i'm afraid she can't help us now .
if she clears at all and can give us anything , i'll call you .
sure .
douglas , take her back to her room .
yes , sir .
come on , sweetheart .
let's go .
you see ... we spent a lot of time in nicaragua and places like that .
for a while there , she was with this crazy ex green beret guy ... running guns .
then there were some other guys .
she'd shack up with anybody she could learn from ... so she could teach me how to be this great military leader .
then she gets busted .
it's like , 'sorry , kid , your mom's a psycho .
didn't you know? '
like everything i've been brought up to believe is all made up bullshit .
i hated her for that .
but everything she said was true .
she knew ... and nobody believed her ... not even me .
listen .
we gotta get her out of there .
negative .
the t 1000's highest probability for success now ... will be to copy sarah connor and wait for you to make contact with her .
great .
what happens to her?
typically , the subject being copied is terminated .
shit !
why didn't you tell me?
we gotta go right now !
negative .
it's not a mission priority .
fuck you !
she's a priority to me !
goddamn it !
what's your problem?
help !
this does not help our mission .
get this psycho off of me !
help !
i'm being kidnapped !
get this psycho off of me !
let me go !
why did you do that?
because you told me to .
what?
you have to do what i say?
that's one of my mission parameters .
prove it .
stand on one foot .
yes !
cool .
my own terminator .
wow .
you okay , kid?
take a hike , bozo .
let's get outta here , man .
fuck you , you little dipshit !
dipshit?
put your leg down .
did you call moi a dipshit?
just trying to help this punk .
grab this guy .
get him off of me !
now who's the dipshit ... you jock douche bag?
put the gun down now !
get outta here !
come on .
let's split !
you were gonna kill that guy !
of course .
i'm a terminator .
listen to me very carefully , okay?
you're not a terminator anymore , all right?
you got that?
you just can't go around killing people .
why?
what do you mean , why?
'cause you can't .
because you just can't .
trust me on this .
look .
i'm gonna go get my mom .
i order you to help me .
you have a sarah connor here?
you're runnin 'kind of late .
they've been in there for an hour .
hold on a second .
i'll buzz you in .
oh , here come your friends now .
gwen , you want some coffee?
no , thanks .
how 'bout a beer?
yeah , right .
hey , i got a full house .
that's good , louis .
must be my lucky day .
you're right about number 24 .
increase the medication to 250 milligrams .
same kind?
mm hmm .
you !
you broke my arm .
there are 215 bones in the human body .
that's one .
now , don't move .
what are you going to do?
why do we stop now?
you gotta promise me you're not gonna kill anyone , right?
right .
swear?
what?
just put up your hand and say , " i swear i won't kill anyone " .
i swear i will not kill anyone .
all right .
let's go .
visiting hours is 10 : 00 to 4 : 00 ...
monday through friday .
what the hell are you doing?
you son of a bitch !
you shot me !
crazy bastard !
don't shoot me again .
don't kill me .
he'll live .
son of a bitch !
let's try to remain calm .
open it , or he'll be dead before he hits the floor .
there's no way , connor .
let him go .
open the door .
it ain't gonna happen .
take it easy , sarah .
it won't work .
you're no killer .
i don't believe you can do it .
you're already dead .
everybody dies .
you know i believe it .
so don't fuck with me !
open the door !
back off !
get back !
i'll pump him full of this shit .
i swear !
don't move !
drop the shit !
do it !
get in the office .
on the floor , face down .
not you !
open the door .
on the floor .
hold it open .
face the wall !
get her !
hurry up !
open the door !
the door's locked !
let's go !
open it !
she broke it off .
open it !
let's go around !
come on !
move it !
mom , wait !
come back here !
help her !
wait here .
hurry up !
he'll kill us all !
hold her .
he'll kill us all !
mom , are you okay?
mom !
come with me if you want to live .
it's okay , mom .
he's here to help .
go .
what the fuck is it?
what the fuck is going on?
get down .
out of the car !
right now !
go !
i'm out .
come on .
here .
reload .
last one !
hang on .
ready !
here , drive .
there's nobody behind us .
are you all right?
yeah .
can he see anything?
i see everything .
cool .
come here .
i said i was okay .
john , it was stupid of you to go there .
you have to be smarter than that .
you were almost killed .
what were you thinking?
you cannot risk yourself , even for me .
do you understand?
you're too important .
do you understand?
but ...
i had to get you out of that place .
i'm sorry .
i didn't need your help .
what's wrong with your eyes?
nothing .
so , what's your story?
you okay?
fine .
say , that's a nice bike .
watch it , lug nuts .
listen , do you know what you're doing?
i have detailed files on human anatomy .
i bet .
makes you a more efficient killer , right?
correct .
does it hurt when you get shot?
i sense injuries .
the data could be called " pain " .
john , help me with the light .
will these heal up?
yes .
good .
if you can't pass for human , you're not much good to us .
how long do you live?
i mean , last .
whatever .
a hundred and twenty years with my existing power cell .
can you learn stuff that you haven't been programmed with ... so you can be ... you know , more human ... and not such a dork all the time?
my cpu is a neural net processor , a learning computer .
the more contact i have with humans , the more i learn .
cool .
are we learning yet?
we have to get as far away from the city as possible .
just head south .
keep it under 65 .
we don't want to be pulled over .
affirmative .
you gotta listen to the way people talk .
you don't say 'affirmative 'or some shit like that .
you say , " no problemo " .
if someone comes off to you with an attitude , you say , " eat me " .
and if you want to shine them on , it's " hasta la vista , baby " .
yeah , or " later , dick wad " .
if someone gets upset , you say , " chill out " .
or you can do combinations .
chill out , dick wad .
that's great .
see?
you're getting it .
want some of my fries?
need any help?
no .
i got you !
no , you didn't !
we're not gonna make it , are we?
people , i mean .
it's in your nature to destroy yourselves .
yeah .
major drag , huh?
break it up before i wring both of your necks .
i need to know how skynet gets built .
who's responsible?
the man most directly responsible is miles bennett dyson .
who is that?
he's the director of special projects at cyberdyne systems corporation .
why him?
in a few months he creates a revolutionary type of microprocessor .
go on .
then what?
in three years cyberdyne will become the largest supplier ... of military computer systems .
all stealth bombers are upgraded with cyberdyne computers ... becoming fully unmanned .
afterwards they fly with a perfect operational record .
the skynet funding bill is passed .
the system goes on line on august 4 , 1997 .
human decisions are removed from strategic defense .
skynet begins to learn at a geometric rate .
it becomes self aware at 2 : 14 a . m .
eastern time , august 29 .
in a panic , they try to pull the plug .
skynet fights back .
yes .
it launches its missiles against the targets in russia .
why attack russia?
aren't they our friends now?
because skynet knows that the russian counterattack ... will eliminate its enemies over here .
jesus .
how much do you know about dyson?
i have detailed files .
i want to know everything .
what he looks like , where he lives , everything .
wait in the car .
you're pretty jumpy , connor .
hey , big john .
what's up?
he's cool , enrique .
he's with me .
he's ...
uncle bob .
uncle bob , this is enrique .
uncle bob , huh?
okay .
drink?
uncle bob "?
you're pretty famous , all over the goddamn tv .
pictures of you , john , your big friend here .
cops are going nuts looking for you .
i just came for my stuff .
i need clothes , food and a truck .
how about the fillings in my teeth?
now , enrique .
you two , you're on weapons detail .
let's go .
one thing about my mom ... she always plans ahead .
excellent .
this is my best truck , but the starter motor's gone .
you got time to change it out?
yeah .
i'm gonna wait 'til dark to cross the border .
i grew up in places like this ... so i thought that's how people lived ... riding around in helicopters , learning how to blow shit up .
that's definitely you .
most of the guys my mom hung around with were geeks ... but there was this one guy , he was kinda cool .
he taught me engines .
hold here .
mom screwed it up , of course .
she'd always tell 'em about judgment day ... and me being this world leader .
that'd be all she wrote .
torque wrench , please .
here .
i wish i could've met my real dad .
you will .
yeah , i guess .
when i'm , like 45 , i think .
they sent him back through time to 1984 .
man .
he hasn't even been born yet .
it messes with your head .
the other bolt .
oh .
here .
mom and him were only together for one night .
she still loves him , i guess .
i see her crying sometimes .
she denies it totally , of course , like she got something stuck in her eye .
why do you cry?
you mean people?
yeah .
i don't know .
we just cry ... you know , when it hurts .
pain causes it?
no .
it's different .
it's when there's nothing wrong with you , but you hurt anyway .
you get it?
no .
all right , my man !
give me five .
just put out your hand like this .
all right !
now hit me .
give me five .
do the same thing .
okay , that's good .
up high .
five low .
too slow .
i'm just kidding .
one more time .
good .
now try it .
now do me .
give me five .
watching john with the machine , it was suddenly so clear .
the terminator would never stop .
it would never leave him , never hurt him ... never shout at him or get drunk and hit him ... or be too busy to spend time with him .
it would always be there ... and it would die to protect him .
of all the would be fathers who came and went over the years ... this thing , this machine ... was the only one who measured up .
in an insane world ... it was the sanest choice .
hey , let's try this one .
there we go .
she said go south with him like you planned .
she'll meet you tomorrow .
mom !
mom , wait !
no fate " .
no fate but what we make .
my father told her this .
i made him memorize it in the future as a message to her .
never mind .
okay , the whole thing goes ...
the future's not set .
there's no fate but what we make for ourselves .
she intends to change the future .
yeah , i guess .
oh , shit !
dyson .
yeah .
gotta be .
miles dyson .
she's gonna blow him away .
come on !
let's go !
this is tactically dangerous .
drive faster .
the t 1000 has the same files that i do .
it knows what i know .
it might anticipate this move .
i don't care .
we gotta stop her .
killing dyson might prevent the war .
i don't care !
haven't you learned anything yet?
haven't you figured out why you can't kill people?
danny , i told you to go to bed .
i'm not kidding .
just a couple of minutes , mom !
danny , your time is up !
come brush your teeth and get to bed .
danny !
daddy !
danny , go !
go !
miles?
tortsia , run !
oh , my god !
just take danny and run !
run !
oh , jesus !
miles !
daddy !
nobody fucking move !
don't hurt my daddy !
on the floor , bitch .
get down now !
move !
don't hurt him !
get on the floor now !
just let the boy go .
shut up .
shut up .
shut up !
it's all your fault , motherfucker .
it's all your fault !
what?
i'm not gonna let you do it .
shit !
we're too late !
check them .
look at me , mom .
are you hurt?
i almost ...
it'll be okay .
we'll figure something out .
okay?
i promise .
you came here to stop me .
yeah , i did .
i love you , john .
i always have .
i know .
