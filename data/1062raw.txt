it's a special reception at 10 : 00 in the penthouse conference room .
where a spectacular ... once in a lifetime opportunity awaits you .

oh , my god .
you should sue somebody .
i did it myself .

he did it himself from a kit .
i knew i recognized you .
you're the referee the bonehead .
that's just the media blowing it out of proportion .
my hairdresser's husband lost $800 because of you .
everybody thinks we flip quarters .

it's really a commemorative coin .

enrico is a girl's name .
no , i wasn't .
no pun intended .
what pun is that?
food .
look at all this food .
what a beautiful party .
little cockdoggies .
they're called cocktail wienies .
wienies .
i'm so sorry .
my english is not so good .
but i'm learning .
that's it .
vera .
we're outta here .
i want to say good bye .
bye , y'all .
excuse me .
thank you all for coming .
i'm donald sinclair .
i own this hotel .
we don't have much time .
there's a meteor the size of north carolina heading straight for earth .
the impact is going to kill every thing and everyone on this planet .
i built a bunker in the basement strong enough to withstand the blast .
there's room for eight people .
i have chosen the seven of you , plus me .
when this is over , we will repopulate and re civilize the planet .
i couldn't resist !
i'm sorry .
a joke .
he made a joke .
do sit down , please .
merrill , you and your mother can sit over here .
how do you know she's my mother?
alas , there are no secrets anymore .
actually , that's not quite true .
there is one secret , one last secret .
it involves all of you .
i'm getting goose pimples .
hey
ah , mr. schaffer !
curiosity got the better of you , eh?
come and sit down .
i'm fine .
thanks .
you haven't missed anything .
we were just cutting to the chase .
cutting to the chase .
well , you'll laugh later .
now , as you know , the odds against winning a jackpot downstairs ... or hitting the state lottery are astronomical millions to one .
a serious person doesn't even bother , but today ... you have the chance of playing a game ... where the odds of winning are one in six .
one in six .
it's one throw ... of the dice .
this is my attorney , mr. grisham ... who tragically was born without a personality .
mr. grisham insists anyone who wishes to participate in our experiment ... sign this waiver , absolving the casino from responsibility or damages ... personal liability , blah , blah , blah .
so , who do you like , claude?
the young woman in the black coat .
she looks desperate .
yes , but she has her mother with her .
that could slow her down , hmm?
perhaps .
now , 563 miles from here ... is a little town called silver city , new mexico .
gold rush .
quite right , nick .
yes , they struck gold there in 1860 .
it was the second largest gold rush in american history .
very good , nick .
i think nick should be our captain .
in downtown silver city , there's a train station .
as you go in the front door , there's some lockers on the right .
mr. grisham , do you have the keys?
six identical keys .
they all open the same locker .
that's locker 001 .
inside the locker is a red duffel bag .
inside the red duffel bag ... is $2 million .
in cash , fifties and hundreds , makes a pile about so big .
first one there keeps it all .
i put transmitting devices in your key rings to keep track of you .
and that's it .
go .
you just can't pick people at random .
i can do anything i like , owen .
i'm eccentric .
go !
wait , wait .
so , it's like a race?
a race .
it's a race .
i hope i win .
what are the rules?
there's only one rule .
are you ready?
here it is .
there are no rules .
go .
go !
so now when you say , " go , " you mean just go?
begin , commence , start moving .
theoretically , you have been racing for about 40 seconds .
so far , mr. schaffer is winning ... because he's nearest to the door .
you're crazy !
a race !
a race !
you have to pace yourself .
carbohydrate is important .
pasta is good .
breathing is important .
scusi .
one
it's some sort of joke .
it has to be .
what kind of jackass just gives away $2 million?
maybe it's a publicity stunt .
what kind of publicity?
he swore us all to secrecy .
maybe it's a secret publicity stunt .
a secret publicity stunt?
yes !
i don't know what his angle is , but there's always an angle .
donald sinclair people like him make millions of dollars ... playing people like us for chumps .
i'm nobody's chump .
so you don't believe 11 : 30 , nonstop to chicago .
i'm gonna be on it .
you know what?
he's right .
i'm not cuttin 'short my first family vacation ... in three years to go on some half assed wild goose chase .
okay , so , you're not goin 'for it?
i don't think so .
not me , no .
no .
great .
i guess that's that , huh?
right .
it was nice meetin 'y'all .
i'm gonna take the stairs .
my room's just two floors down , so nice meetin 'ya .
hey , have a nice vacation .
you know , it's probably stuck .
i think i'm gonna take the stairs too .
crap .
go , go , go , go !
come on , vera !
watch out !
comin 'through !
hold the door , please .
take your time .
no rush .
get up !
wait , wait , wait , wait , wait !
if we're all gonna go for it , why don't we go for it together?
you know , split the money 50 50 .
fifty fifty?
you know what i mean .
whatever .
yes , yes , that's a good plan .
it's a race .
it's a race .
i'm winning .
i'm winning .
and they're off !
no one no one is offering you action like this .
a horse race with animals that can think and plan ... and lie and cheat and play dirty .
it's the gambling experience of a lifetime .
it's my way of saying i understand men like you .
i know what you want .
i know what you need .
this casino my casino is where you belong .
i got it !
excuse me !

silver city , new mexico .
i love new mexico .

stevie wonder could have done a better job calling that game .

ladies and gentlemen , members of the press
what's going on?
some rocket scientists from l. a .... they're trying to break the land speed record .
a unique combination of automotive and aerodynamic innovation .
the vehicle , which we call lightning ll ... represents three years of r & d ... which was conducted at the california institute of technology .
the design team was led by professor ken freedman and dr. richard kramer .
we believe that , aerodynamically ... this is the most perfect vehicle ever designed .
the entire vehicle weighs less than 1, 850 pounds .
the body is a one piece kevlar composite .
the wheels are solid billet aluminum ... and she's powered by twin je 79 turbojet engines ... the same engines that are in the f 4 phantom jet .
are there any questions?
mr. calvert , what is the current land speed record?
that would be 742 miles per hour ... but we hope to have a new record today .
anyone else?
how do you start it?
good question .
a green lever to the left of the steering wheel in the cockpit ... engages the primary thruster , igniting the je
740 , 745
that's a record .
they'll break the sound barrier .
well , that's it .
i still don't think she's gonna hold .
what do we owe you?
five hundred bucks .
what?
for two quarts of sealant?
no way .
that's 20 bucks tops .
okay , here's 40 dollars .
that's double what it's worth , okay?
come on , nick .
let's go .
hold it .
another little tool no mechanic should be without .
fine .
here's your $500 .
but you know what , billy ray?

somebody once told me
the world is gonna roll me
i ain't the sharpest toolin the shed
and she was lookin 'kind of dumb
with a finger and a thumb
in the shape of an " l " on her forehead
well , the years start comin 'and they don't stop comin '
fed to the rules and i hit the ground runnin '
didn't make sense not to live for fun
your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
so much to do , so much to see
so what's wrong with takin 'the backstreets
you'll never know if you don't go
you'll never shine if you don't glow
hey , now , you're an all star
get your game on , go play
hey , now , you're a rock star get the show on , get paid
all that glitters is gold
only shooting stars break the mold
it's a cool place and they say it gets colder
you're bundled up now wait till you get older
but the meteor men beg to differ
judgin 'by the hole in the satellite picture
the ice we skate is gettin 'pretty thin
the water's gettin 'warm so you might as well swim
my world's on fire how about yours
that's the way i like it and i'll never get bored
hey , now , you're an all star get your game on , go play
hey , now , you're a rock star get the show on , get paid
all that glitters is gold
only shooting stars break the mold
go to the moon
go to the moon
go to the moon
oh , yeah , go to the moon
hey , now , you're an all star get your game on , go play
hey , now , you're a rock star get the show on , get paid
all that glitters is gold
only shooting stars
somebody once asked could i spare some change for gas
i need to get myself away from this place
i said yep , what a concept
i could use a little fuel myself
and we all could use a little change
well , the years start comin 'and they don't stop comin '
fed to the rules and i hit the ground runnin '
didn't make sense not to live for fun
your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
so much to do so much to see
so what's wrong with takin 'the backstreets
you'll never know if you don't go
you'll never shine if you don't glow
hey , now , you're an all star get your game on , go play
hey , now , you're a rock star get the show on , get paid
all that glitters is gold
only shooting stars break the mold
all that glitters is gold
only shooting stars break the mold
