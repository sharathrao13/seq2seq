100 years ago , this island in taiwan ... had nothing
only romance
legend has it
there were two lovers
and one day
the man was fishing
his boat sank
the woman ... saw it onshore
she swam out
no one ever saw them again
some say they became dolphins
all dolphins around this island ... came from them
they all make ...
bu ... bu " noises
nice story?
so snooty
you told a horror story
don't get involved
have some melon
no
you're like ... those dolphins
so picky
you named me bu
i've told you so often
don't mix mandarin ... with cantonese
bu's mandarin and cantonese ... are now both accented
that's awful
you teach her mandarin then
get off my case
that's cantonese again
which i don't speak
what did you say?
tell me
skipper restaurant
open bar , folks

bu , 6 beers , on me
they come everyday
never pay
add water ... to the beer
that trick again?
bu yes?
hurry
here
did you add water?
no !
no , very good
c'mon

this oyster's not cheap
he proposed to me

you love him?
well , he's actually ...
not bad
your answer
shouldn't be over 4 words
you love him , or you don't
you left hong kong ... to marry dad , why?
he was quite a hunk
a good cook too
you're a good cook
he's better
he cooks with love
what's loving someone like?
you miss him
the sight of him thrills you
you ache
when he's gone
you could watch him forever
even when he's sleeping
you're in love
lf you feel like that
okay?
you miss hong kong?
yes , especially its chinese pot rice
i see
you don't love longyi
take mama's advice
trust your heart
do what you have to do
bu
hey , kid

somebody said
men and women ... exist in pairs
till separated on earth
then they go through life
searching for one another

ls yen ... appreciating?
ls the lease for the us base ... in japan expiring?
lf both answer are affirmative

they're doomed
so go ahead

stop moaning
you know
that bottle's very special
so special that ... all of a sudden
i'm feeding and sheltering you
just like that

c. n.?
more than once
last night ...
you told me that too
i think he's ... nice
nice?
these magazines are published weekly
and he changes girlfriends just as often
he's not nice , he's a playboy
let's see
an ex girlfriend says
he doesn't say sweet words
but he's a romantic man
he appears stem and talks tough
lnside he's like a kid
he's competitive and chases novelty
never regrets any decision
with him ...
you feel insecure
meaning?
chases novelty , so he fools around
no regrets , so he enjoys dumping women
maybe those women deserved it
they were insecure ... to begin with
spare me
hong kong's boring anyway
going home?
no , c. n. is fun
you have to hook him first
can't just walk up
and take off your clothes
that sure won't work
but you never know
he's competitive and chases novelty
i have a plan , i need your help
no way

you feed , shelter , and clothe me
you're my guardian angel
your wish is ... my command
bye

you're playing a gangster's lady
use method acting
teach me
just act snooty
feed , shelter , and clothe her
i'm an angel
she forgot something?
yes?
help !
it's you !
where's bu?
please tell me where she is
mr. chan
thanks
mr. chan
what's this?
excuse me
the lady's so lovely
she deserves some wind effect
you look gorgeous
i know
well?
a vintage wine , from '82
but i can also tell
the grape picker was born in '60
let's order
you order
you do chinese pot rice?
just kidding
thank god !
you got a thing about people watching you eat?
we don't want to be crowded
excuse me
you booked the whole place?
just you and me
i was hoping
to run into celebrities
you must really ... hate crowds
what about your friends?
here comes one
mr. lo , you can't go in
why'd you do it?
dump my company's shares?
i'm at dinner , call me tomorrow
you're hurting me
and yourself too
mr. lo , please leave
sir
you look intelligent
i am intelligent
then stay home and think
devise a way ... to save your company

c. n. 's friend
he booked the whole place for me
you're disturbing us
that's so rude
let's talk outside
we've talked enough
see you outside
that signal means " follow me
wrong again?
you're snooty
so are my friends it rubs off
you have to go?
it'll just take a minute
c. n.
watch your back
watch your back
i called , cleared it with your boss
i'm meeting mr. chan
close the parking lot for us
relax , i'm footing the bill
fine , mr. lo
you heard mr. lo , move out
have fun , mr. chan
lw
what's up?
i want you to meet someone
i hired him from overseas
ladies and gentlemen
alan
an undefeated light weight champion
he'll fight you one on one
but ...
i'm a middle weight
too much of an edge
but if you lose
think of the disgrace
grow up
nuts
play this music for me
no problem
you have no choice
why the gloves?
this is a boxing match
i'm not ... into crippling people
with gloves , it won't hurt?
sure it'll hurt
but much less
all set
watch your head
music
knock me down anyway you can
but no dirty tricks
they say you're a great fighter .
come on
look !
they're not gonna let you leave here without a fight
you ask for it
are you ready?
of course
alan's losing bigtime
no , alan's just testing him
he's wearing chan down
wait good
changing gloves , why?
even the odds
bigger the glove , bigger the handicap
chan's punches are soft
i've come a long way ,
i don't want a short game
every boxer trains ... to his own music
when he fights , it give him rhythm
and rhythm paces his steps
chan has no rhythm
he's controlled by alan
you're an expert
you should be fighting
right
c. n. and i used to box
but i always lost
so i quit and became a ...
commentator
wow !
you like that better?
sure .
i sound so invincible
but i'm just like you guys
helpless
chan used to have brilliant moves
now he's a mess
buying companies ... instead of training
loser !
chan's nervous , it's over
good hit , but not enough power
come on
you okay?
you win
we won
let's kick him while he's down
good idea
don't be ... such cowards
ganging up on a downed man
there's no honor in that
you're good
get the car
my joy is done .
he's good
c. n. , you okay?
you must be delighted
no , but i thought i would be
you need help?
damn it
c. n. , call me
you didn't leave?
you asked me to wait
i came to find you
did they gang up on you?
no , one on one , i lost
you'll get used to it
just kidding
start training tomorrow , you'll beat them
i'll train , but not for them
for what then?
a strong body , a quick mind
i haven't trained in ages
your huge gym , what a waste
i hate training alone
i'll join you
why be so nice to me?
you're rich
you're cute when you smile
you looked grouchy just now
that's why you lost
stick with smiling
these clothes and makeup don't fit you
take tomorrow off
why?
say yes first
why?
say yes first
yes , now why?
play !
memories are so many
anticipation i now dare to indulge
i sketch a hazy future
knowing this illusion is love
the tides of a lifetime
widen the shores slowly
quietly you and i meet
our love proves life is ever changing
shooting stars change courses
miracles catch up with us
like eternity
ls the night really still young?
currents change courses too
the crowds catch up with us
i can think no more
but this love
links the sea with the sky
my eyes have been raining
i can't hold on with both hands
i cry as we seek happiness
you're just like a shooting star
those happy moments
lock you between my brows
no matter how the world dazzles
it pales next to your eternal splendor
shooting stars change courses
miracles catch up with us
like eternity
ls the night really still young?
you love me?
i think you're quite ...
answer the question
the fact is ...
c'mon
answer in 4 words or less
i love you
or i don't
when did you slip in?
i'm in love
love's a dream that leaves only emptiness
so don't get fooled by love
you're such an optimist
i have news for you
what?
longyi's here
he almost strangled me
but i calmed him down
he's been drunk ever since
my fault
no way
listen , love is not sympathy
you're tangled up ... with chan
don't let longyi see you
wine please no
wait
let go

the acquisition ... is a go?
i'll let you know
