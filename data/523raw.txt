things just got a lot more complicated , didn't they , dennis?
not to mention the fact that helicopters are very expensive ,
gotta pay for the fuel , the pilot ... chief of police ,
you know what cops do when they retire , dennis?
they play golf ,
i don't want to play golf , i hate fucking golf ,
i want a house on the golf course ,

walter smith talked to me before he died ,
i know about the money ,
i don't know shit about money , man , i don't know shit about what you're talking about ,

bullshit ,
that's the way it is , kevin , always has been and always will be ,
always , ok?
what ...
what if they just want to get us outside just to shoot us?
they could have killed us , like , a million times , kev ,

you just chose the wrong house on the wrong day ,
i'm not lying , bullshit ,
the only thing i lied to you about was smith ,

chief talley ,
the situation has clearly gotten away from you ,
your flagrant disregard for protocol has unnecessarily placed yourself and my officers in the line of fire ,

you remain in command , there's a probability of a negative outcome ,
jeff !
what are you doing?
no , jeff , jeff , jeff , jeff , jeff ,
you've just made it easier , chief , you're done , you're finished ,
chief talley?
the fbl's here at the barricade and they're asking for you .
