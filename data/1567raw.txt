here , are you starting again?
what if i am?
what if the police come?
let 'em .
the windows are steamed up , the doors are locked .
it's like a turkish bath .
it don't half make you thirsty .
here !
watch your ring with my stockings .
move over a bit , then .
get your knee off the wheel !
i can't .
i'm stuck .
look out .
i'll do it .
that hurt !
i told you to be careful with your legs .
i was only trying to be helpful .
i can help myself .
hello .
they never make these cars big enough , do they?
well , you all settled in?
we can begin .
my name is ...
alfie?
alfie .
i suppose you think you're going to see the bleeding titles now .
well , you're not , so relax .
what time will your old man be at the station?
never mind him .
that's who i will mind .
never spoil a good thing .
you women don't get that .
enough's as good as a feast .
you've changed your tune .
that horn put me off .
i hate noise at a time like that .
eh , mate?
don't forget your napkin .
the first time you put your hankie over your shoulder ,
i thought you were going to play your fiddle .
i come from a musical family .
here .
mind you don't catch cold .
i've had a lovely time , alfie .
a married woman .
every one of 'em in need of a good laugh .
it never strikes their husbands .
make a married woman laugh and you're halfway there with her .
it don't work with the single bird .
it'd start you off on the wrong foot .
you get one of them laughing , you won't get nothing else .
just listen to it .
it was dead glum when i met it tonight .
i listened to its problems , then i got it laughing .
it'll go home happy .
where'd you tell your husband you were?
pictures with olive .
what pictures?
just the pictures .
never be vague .
it plants suspicion .
no wonder there's all this broken marriage and divorce .
it would never occur to him that another man would wanna take me out .
no , i see what you mean .
suck this sweet so he don't smell the gin .
i don't care if he does .
be human .
why should we hurt him?
he's done us no harm .
you want everybody happy .
i don't believe in making anybody unhappy if i don't have to .
or in making an enemy .
you could be crossing the sahara , and he'd be the bloke you met .
what about next week?
same time , same place?
maybe .
i'll go and get my ticket .
she don't know we won't be seeing much more of her .
she's on her way out .
when a married woman gets too hot on , it's time to cool off .
next thing she'll want is to introduce me to the husband .
i can see it coming .
i'll say good night to you , girl .
the firm's dance is on saturday .
i'll treat you .
won't your old man be there?
yeah , i'd like you to meet .
night .
don't forget your napkin .
i'm like the boy scouts , always prepared .
once i've met the husband , it don't half put me off the wife .
he could be dying , but if i ain't met him , i won't think about him .
it's once you meet .
like as not , he'll turn out to be a good sport .
his sort usually are .
as i'm having it off with her ,
i keep thinking about him hanging up his shirts .
or arguing in the pub about football or cricket .
you get a lot of his sort , chelsea supporters .
hello .
had a nice time , dear?
not bad at all .
good film?
there was a queue , so we didn't wait .
we went to a restaurant .
did you enjoy yourself?
that's the main thing .
well , i did my best .
what about you?
i went through that garden catalogue that came .
very interesting .
you should go out more .
you come back so cheerful made over again .
now i'm off to visit a little bird called gilda .
while she ain't exactly stupid , she is a bit on the simple side .
she'd never make a number one .
you couldn't take her out and show her off .
she ain't an exciting dresser , but she's a cracking little stand by .
and for another thing , she ain't a liberty taker .
most birds go mad to get hold of a bloke and then go about changing him .
i told gilda from the start that i ain't the marrying sort .
do you know what?
she don't mind .
she's a stand by and she knows it .
any bird that knows its place in this world can be quite content .
alfie? !
did you forget your key?
humphrey , it's you .
yeah .
i'm sorry for coming round so late , but i was just passing by .
yes , i see .
i'd just finished work and i was feeling a bit lonely , so i thought i'd pop in .
yes , i see .
have i come at an awkward time?
i am expecting alfie any minute .
there's a pong in here !
it's phul nana .
the scent of araby .
don't you like it?
no .
i like things to smell natural .
i've got your meal ready .
never push things at me as soon as i come in .
like to get my bearings .
just as you like it .
that's enough of that , an 'all .
i saw that geezer humphrey going off .
here .
you're not having it off with him , are you?
alfie , i can't bear another man to come near me since i met you .
i just wondered .
did he just call to give you these chocolates , then?
no .
he called to tell me he loved me .
love you?
some men are funny .
alfie , do you love me?
well , shall we say i like you a lot .
ah , well , i will have that grub after all .
hot water bottle?
she's getting a bit previous .
hello .
is today the 22nd?
yeah , i think so .
shouldn't our little friend have arrived on the 19th?
don't worry , he'll turn up .
he always has done .
he's usually so punctual .
i had a really good day at the caf .
i took over 50 on the till .
isn't that wonderful?
what's so wonderful?
it ain't your money .
i like to think of them doing well .
it keeps me busy .
it's time you started that fiddle , playing the piano on the till .
alfie , i couldn't .
that's the only till in london that ain't bent .
luigi and his wife treat me like family .
all the more reason to do 'em .
alfie , i'm happy as i am .
you could still be happy with a few hundred quid in the bank .
now , look .
the one thing you've got to get into that head of yours is that nobody helps you in this life .
you've got to help yourself .
if you fiddled five bob a day , you'd have 200 nicker on one side by now .
money isn't everything .
only people who ain't got none say that .
i've had a fiddle on every job i've done .
a fiddle gives you an interest in your work .
i believe that everybody should take an interest in their work .
there's another little job done .
you sound cheerful , elkins .
some mornings , i feel chirpy .
yeah?
not all that chirpy on what i'm paying you .
you must be working a nice fiddle .
that's defamation of character .
i'll report you .
come off it .
how do you think i got where i am?
i'm quite satisfied as long as you do the job well .
but don't get greedy , otherwise you'll kill the goose .
i tumbled at once .
i shouldn't whistle .
never be cheerful if you're doing a fiddle .
you're getting careless .
you can say that again .
little gilda , she's pregnant .
no !
how long?
couple of months .
you ain't thinking of getting married?
me , in my state of health?
sorry , full up .
room for just one more inside .
humphrey , i'm glad it's your bus .
are you?
i haven't seen you for so long .
you don't need flinging down stairs to know you're not welcome .
i'm sorry .
that's alright .
i've missed our little chats .
have you?
two six pennies , when you've got the time !
ta .
i've never seen you looking lovelier .
still can't get you out of my mind .
how's ...
how's alfie these days?
he's fine .
mind you , it doesn't hurt like it used to .
what doesn't?
the old heartache .
still , i wouldn't be without it .
you haven't got engaged or anything like that , have you?
no , nothing like that .
he doesn't rush into things , alfie .
i don't expect you'll ever need me .
but if you do , i'll always be there .
bye , gilda .
god bless .
hello , alfie .
you're late , girl .
i ran all the way .
any news?
any reports from the front?
no .
it doesn't look like it .
we've got to do something about this little lot .
i've tried everything .
you're taking stuff on the quiet?
you don't wanna make yourself ill .
alfie .
you're getting cooey lately .
i'm sorry .
and in a way you're more bossified , as if i've got to take notice of you , instead of you of me .
i can't describe it , but i can feel it .
do you love me?
what can i say when you ask?
you shouldn't ask , you know .
i'll tell you , when i feel like it .
i'll go and make the coffee .
yeah .
make it strong .
alfie , i was thinking .
why can't we ... go through with it?
what an 'orrible thought !
i've never been through with anything .
if i was to marry you , you'd gain a husband but lose a friend .
you don't have to marry me .
i've got it worked out .
i don't care .
think twice before you turn an innocent creature out .
i wouldn't turn him out .
i'll have him adopted .
what are you talking about?
well , by a rich woman , see?
a rich woman?
i'd like to do that much for him .
i'd be certain he'd have a good life , then .
steady on , girl .
you can't be sure there's something there yet .
this morning , i thought i felt him kick .
how can they kick?
it won't be the size of my thumbnail .
i'll tell you next time .
you won't !
don't give way to your impulses .
something a woman might think natural a bloke will find sickening .
mrs artoni at the caf called her husband every time their baby moved .
you don't realise that men are more sensitive than women .
remember that big bird i'd dance with at the locarno?
one sunday night she showed me her operation scar , from when she was a kid .
a long scar with white skin round it .
i got straight out of bed and put my clobber on .
what's up with you? " she says .
i'd sooner see a bleeding horror film , " i said , " than that .
alfie , please .
can i , you know , go through with it and have the baby?
what you asking me for?
it's yours , isn't it?
nobody in this world has any right to stop you doing what you want to .
steady on , girl .
now , then .
don't break your bleeding heart .
if you wanna do something and you think it's right , you do it .
to hell with 'em .
mind my shirt .
now ...
she was quite happy them months she was carrying , which to my mind was out of place in a way , her not being married .
mind you , she came over quite beautified for a time , especially in the early months .
i told her .
i says , " blimey , girl , you ain't as ugly as i thought .
anyway , her time comes and into the hospital she goes to have it .
i wasn't there , so i didn't know till they told me .
then , from all accounts , the kid comes out a treat .
right bang on the minute , you might say .
alfie?
i didn't see you there .
you look all different .
what do you mean?
well , sort of mumsy .
i put my name down as mrs elkins .
was that alright?
course it's alright .
put your name down as who you like .
it's a free country , isn't it?
i brought you some flowers , but i didn't want to be seen carrying them .
that's nice .
freesias !
how delightful .
i'll put them into a vase for you , mrs elkins .
what do you think of your son , mr elkins?
my what?
he hasn't seen him yet .
here he is .
he's the image of his father .
yes .
i can see more of me in him than you .
what are you gonna call him?
i thought malcolm alfred .
malcolm bleeding alfred?
he'll never forgive you if you give him a name like that !
here , he's moving .
quick , you better take him .
the mistake i made with gilda was getting involved .
i was having a beautiful little life and i couldn't see it .
there was this manageress of a dry cleaner's .
and i was getting a suit cleaned in the bargain . well , you can't turn something like that down .
then , there was a chiropodist from a foot comfort service
i was having it off with .
she cut my corns handsome .
i never had my feet in such lovely condition .
i was hopping about like a little fairy .
she's got a little ginger moustache , but i find i'm quite willing to overlook the odd blemish in a woman , provided she's got something else to make up for it .
well , that's why we're here to help one another out in this life .
then there was dora , a little bird from pimlico
i had it off with mondays and wednesdays when her young man was at his body building classes .
and , on top of them , there was always the odd bird that came my way by chance .
what a lovely baby .
is it yours?
no , no , it's my sister's .
so why i had to get involved with gilda , i do not know .
what's that brown round his mouth?
a bar of chocolate i gave him .
alfie , you shouldn't !
you smell a bit milkified .
i'm sorry , alfie , i'll have a wash .
no , i don't mind , it smells mumsy .
how long will you do the breast feeding caper?
as long as i can .
it's the best thing for him .
don't let yourself get too attached to him .
why not?
i'm his mother .
and i'm his father , but you've gotta be fair .
you've gotta think of him .
what about this rich woman?
what rich woman?
the one who was gonna adopt him , so he'd have a chance in life .
i've got to think about it .
i can't rush into it .
make up your mind quick .
why should i?
he might get so drawn to you ,
it'll fret his heart out when they take him away .
who says they'll take him away?
that's what you said .
you were gonna get him adopted so he'd want for nothing .
that was a long time ago .
you know what you've had , don't you , girl?
you've had a change of heart .
i can see it in your face .
what about it?
haven't you ever had one?
yes , but i've always resisted it .
lying in hospital feeding him brought it on .
i could see your face changing .
coming over all mumsy .
i'm not ashamed of it .
but you've got to think of him .
you could never bring him up like this rich woman could .
we'll see .
i'm going back to work next week .
she could really take care of him .
dress him handsome .
who says i can't dress him proper?
look at that lovely shawl , and the things for him in that drawer .
you can't learn him to talk nice .
not like this rich woman could .
i can if i try hard .
not proper , you can't . he'll be " bleeding " this and that and worse .
i won't let him .
these are dry , you can use 'em .
who'll look after him when you go back to the caff?
i'm not going back .
i'll work in the brewery .
it's better paid .
lugging bleeding beer crates about?
when will you learn some sense?
who will look after him while you're at the brewery?
a woman called mrs tippet .
she's got four children of her own and she'll look after him from monday morning till friday teatime .
and i'll have him all the weekend .
i think that's best for him .
and what about ... and what about me?
you think i'll spend my weekends dodging under wet nappies?
you won't leave us , alfie?
not now?
i'll have to think about it .
please !
i won't ever ask you for anything , not a farthing .
but don't leave us now .
if you do ...
don't talk like that .
i haven't said i'll leave you .
i had to speak up .
i don't think you're doing right by that kid .
but i will .
i'll look after him .
i'll never neglect him .
never .
i'm only telling you the truth as i see it .
you won't leave us , will you?
promise me , alfie .
promise !
let go .
don't ruckle my sleeve .
i ain't a savage .
i ain't gonna scarper .
but don't start crying , either .
i'll belt you one for sure .
i don't feel up to it .
don't jump up to him at once .
it don't do .
you'll grow more attached to each other , and he won't go to mrs tippet .
here , mate .
that's enough of that .
i'll give you something to cry for .
come on now .
there you are .
all you need is a father's voice .
he's got a hard life in front of him .
don't give him any wrong impression from the start .
now , about this little kid of mine .
he turns out to be a real quick 'un .
and he don't half love it when i play games with him .
never wants his mother , always asking for his father .
very soon , i find i'm getting quite attached to him .
know what i mean?
that's something i always guard against .
because sooner or later that's gonna bring you some pain .
so if a bird ain't got you one way , she's got you another .
that's the trouble .
once you get a kid in your life , it ain't your own .
look at the things you have to do .
next , please .
well , you can't be too careful , not with hereditary .
no smoking , please .
queer job for a bird , photographing people's insides .
chin on the top , please .
hands on hips .
shoulders forward .
what's she think i am , a bleeding contortionist?
nice hands , though .
firm but gentle .
know what i mean?
i wouldn't mind her giving me a ...
hold it .
next , they'll be taking pictures of what you're thinking .
there'll be some x certificates knocking around .
sorry i'm late .
there was a traffic jam at piccadilly .
it's alright , you're here now .
i brought you some cherries .
you shouldn't have done .
well , we never got that rain they promised us .
doesn't look like it .
you had a hard morning?
the usual .
i don't like you working on that brewery bay .
it's no job for a woman .
you get used to it .
what's that?
that ring i was talking about .
it's heavy !
22 carat .
solid gold .
same as i say that was my mother's .
they don't make rings like that today .
they made 'em to last then .
can i try it on?
yeah , go on .
er , no .
no , sorry , but it's bad luck .
once you put a wedding ring on , you should never take it off .
that's what they say .
i don't know if there's anything in it .
humphrey?
how would you feel ... bringing up another man's child?
have a cherry?
you mean little malcolm? well , i mean ...
once we were married , i could only look on him as my own child .
i'd try to be a good father to him , if he'd have me .
here .
look , can i have this?
come on , darling , have a little bit of the lady's sandwich .
just a little bit .
come on , darling .
i won't hurt you .
just a little bit .
come on .
good boy .
i must go .
i shall be late for work .
will you think over what i said last wednesday?
i've been thinking it over .
i'll tell it to you for the last time , malcolm .
then you've gotta go to bye byes .
abou ben adhem , may his tribe increase , awoke one night from a dream of peace .
and saw within the moonlight in his room , making it rich and like a lily in bloom , an angel writing in a book of gold ...
what's a angel?
you know what an angel is .
i told you .
they're on guard , up in heaven , all round god .
exceeding peace had made ben adhem bold ...
who's ben adhem?
he's the man it's all happening to .
now , shut your eyes and listen , malcolm .
lie down , and don't ask questions .
and to the presence in the room he said ,
'what writest thou? '
the vision raised its head , and , with a look made of all sweet accord , answered , 'the names of those who love the lord . '
what a lad .
he could hardly keep his eyes open , but he wouldn't give in .
know what?
he went off just like that .
he'll be a real handful in a few months 'time .
we'll have to be careful what we say in front of him .
he's as sharp as a needle .
wait till he sees that teddy bear i bought for his birthday .
it's about that size .
ever so soft .
the bloke who sold it to me said it was a real rich kid's teddy .
here , do you fancy an hour's kip , girl , while he's asleep?
cloth ears !
i'm talking to you .
humphrey's been to see me twice this week at lunch time .
what's he after?
a bit on the side?
nothing like that .
we just talked a bit .
don't tell me what you talked about , because i don't want to know !
one thing i can't bear to hear about is a bird and a bloke having innocent talks together .
i think it's more intimate than the other .
what is he after?
he wants to marry me .
what did you tell him?
that i'd talk it over with you .
why talk it over with me?
you're a free agent .
malcolm needs a father .
what do you think i am?
i don't mean just a weekend father , i mean a proper father .
yeah , well , we all need proper fathers .
and proper mothers , too , come to that .
it seems there's just not enough to go around these days .
i don't love him .
i don't know what love is , the way you birds talk about it .
but i respect him .
well , you'd better marry him , then , hadn't you?
you've got young buster in there to think about .
i'll be seeing you .
maybe .
daddy !
daddy !
nice , isn't it?
goes like a bomb , too .
this car hire firm i'm working for , they have all the best stuff .
know where i'm off to now?
pick up a party of publicans , take 'em to brighton for the races .
you've gotta get out and enjoy yourself .
once a bloke starts thinking about a bird he's finished with , well , there's a waste of time for you .
i'm not picking 'em up till 11 : 30 , so i'm popping in here .
it's that x ray .
didn't come out right or something .
load of red tape , if you ask me .
tilt forward , please .
thank you .
you've done this before , haven't you?
thank you .
have you been worrying about anything lately , mr elkins?
who , me?
no , i'm not the worrying sort .
you know what?
gilda's only decided to marry this humphrey geezer .
do you find you get tired easily?
no , i'm always full of energy .
i got a letter from her , see?
i don't love him , " she says , " but i do respect him .
i don't want no bird's respect .
i wouldn't know what to do with it .
step on the scales , please .
i haven't got much time .
she's told me time and again she loves me .
loves me for myself , whatever that means .
have you lost any weight?
no , i always weigh 12 stone six .
have done for years .
but i've never told her i love her .
except when you've gotta say something for appearances 'sake .
11 stone nine pounds .
get out of it !
you sure these scales are right?
this suit don't weigh nothing .
nine ounces , lightweight .
it's the new terylene and mohair .
you don't feel as though you've got nothing on at all .
the one thing i never do with a woman , i never ...
would you take your shirt off , please?
would you take your shirt off , please?
i never crawl to one .
they either take me as i am or not at all .
do you perspire?
i mean , do you sweat much?
sweat?
no .
tell a lie , i did sweat last sunday at the locarno .
but i was dancing , and i'd had a few beers .
i use a deodorant under my armpits .
just rub it on .
quite good , they are .
i see .
do you ever sweat at night?
at night?
you mean in bed?
yes , in bed .
come to think of it , i did sweat a lot last night .
i couldn't for the life of me understand why .
sit there with your back to me , please .
now take a deep breath .
now breathe out slowly .
she said , " malcolm will be alright .
i'll be home to look after him .
again .
a good deep one .
hold it .
let it out .
what about you? " she said .
won't you miss us?
say 99 .
99 .
i came over quite choked at that .
again .
whisper it this time .
99 .
whisper it again .
99 .
course i managed before ...
i managed before i met her and i'll manage now she's gone .
do you ever feel any back pain?
pain?
no .
you know what?
last week , i find i'm missing her , so i calls ...
funny , i do feel some pain there now .
where?
there?
no , a bit to the left .
there?
no , higher up .
there?
yeah , there .
is it tender?
it is when you mess it about .
turn around , please .
yeah , so i calls round , you see .
she wouldn't let me in .
she kept me at the door .
take a deep breath .
but little malcolm kept yelling " daddy ! " so she had to let me in .
breathe out .
she wouldn't let me touch her .
she drew back for the first time .
99 .
100 .
what?
99 .
yeah , she drew back .
sorry , but i'm playing fair by humphrey , the way i've always played fair by you .
do you cough much?
cough?
no .
only in the mornings , but everyone does after the first smoke .
fair by me?
she never wanted no other geezer when she was with me .
what playing fair was that?
bleeding sauce !
bring anything up when you cough?
no .
i just clear my chest .
that's the point of coughing .
bring something up , clear the tubes .
now , the pair of 'em have taken my little son from me .
there are times when i can still hear him calling " daddy ! " after me .
do you find you get quickly irritable of late?
funny you should ask .
i do find i do my nut very easily these days .
do you sleep well?
like a top .
the moment my head hits the pillow , i'm off .
i never wake up till ...
till when , mr elkins?
i never used to wake up till it was time to get up .
that's elkins with an s.
you know what i mean?
i think so .
and now?
i wake up dead on the same time .
four o'clock in the morning .
that is , no matter how much i've had to drink or ...
can i be perfectly frank with you?
certainly .
no matter who's beside me .
you know what i mean?
yes , i understand .
thank you .
i never have been partial to these all night sessions .
for one thing , i've rarely found a woman ...
you don't mind if i come out with it straight?
you can tell me everything .
very few birds can get into my rhythm of sleeping .
i see .
i find myself lying there in the dark staring at the ceiling .
i keep thinking about this kid i used to know .
i was friendly with his mother .
nothing special , just an ordinary girl .
but i knew him well , the child .
there's something i must tell you .
aii i wanted was for her to come back with little malcolm , so we could spend our sundays together .
but she never come .
do you understand me?
yes , perfectly .
now .
if you lose a bird , you can always replace her .
but with a child , it's different .
they're each one themselves .
each one's got his different nature .
i may not be the best dad in the world , but i am his real dad .
credit where credit's due .
there's something i must tell you .
he's come out of these loins .
what do you wanna tell me?
look at this .
they can't get away from it .
he's my son .
this is your x ray , mr elkins .
blimey !
is that me?
yes , it is .
i'm just a load of old ribs !
i'm afraid there are two shadows on your lungs .
shadows on my lungs?
what are you talking about?
look at this patch .
you've got an infection here .
and one here .
an infection?
i can't have !
i ain't been with nobody !
it's not a question ...
you have to do something about it .
we can deal with it .
i want the best attention there is .
i'll even pay for it .
it's just a question of rest .
that's all you need .
i can't rest .
i'm off to brighton with licentious victuallers !
we're in for a blow out .
it's booked !
it has to be unbooked .
you need rest in the country .
i hate the country .
how can you rest with all that bleeding dawn chorus?
what's the matter?
my feet feel like lead .
the sweat's pouring off me !
mr elkins , do keep calm .
these are only shadows .
shadows?
on my lungs?
i'm being eaten away !
this is the end of me !
god in heaven , help me !
good afternoon , mr elkins .
good afternoon .
here , once you know you ain't gonna die , funny how soon you pull back to normal .
i used to think money was everything .
if you've got money , i used to say , you can have beautiful birds , handsome suits , a car of your own .
but those things ain't a bit of use without good health .
hello , harry .
not come yet?
she's run off with the milkman .
here , see this chap here?
his name's harry clamacraft .
he's 35 years old , married , with three kids .
he's sitting in bed waiting for his wife , lily , to visit .
he's had nothing else on his mind since sunday .
i know for sure she'll be late .
watch him .
in a minute , he'll pick up that book and pretend he's not worried and he's reading .
there you are , what did i tell you?
he's no more reading than i am .
he's all ears , listening for her footsteps .
you know what?
i ain't had a single visitor since i've been in here .
i told 'em all i'm on silence , not allowed to talk .
oi , harry , your old woman's here .
mrs clamacraft?
don't go all the way round .
come through here .
i'm not supposed to .
course you can .
come on .
here she is , harry .
hello , love .
harry , i'm sorry i'm late .
that's alright .
now you've come .
she's 20 minutes late and now she wastes another 20 telling him why .
i left home in time , but everything went wrong at the station .
you look worried .
i was only worried in case something had happened to you .
here's your new laid eggs .
here's your marmalade .
bleeding great chunks of peel in it .
no wonder he's ill .
did that chap come about the smell in the garden?
he thinks it's trouble with the main drain .
now he's worried about the bleeding drains .
how were your last x rays?
i think they're improving .
ask him to look at that loose gutter .
it might fall on you or the kids .
kill the bleeding lot of 'em .
i will .
how was your sputum test?
now there's a morale raiser !
they're waiting for the results .
are you managing alright?
i mean , about money?
yes , everything's going fine .
you're sure?
yes , certain .
they're trying to get through to one another .
know what i mean?
it ain't easy with their sort of mentality .
here , see this?
carla , her name is .
hear how her skirt rustles?
there's something about that rustling .
i think i'll get on my bed , just in case .
don't let me disturb you .
you can take that later .
i know what it must be like , seeing each other only once a week .
she seems quite nice .
yeah , she's very nice .
i'll just get you ready for your injection , mr elkins .
thank you , nurse .
would you like a banana?
thanks .
ta .
did my mother come round?
what? !
yes .
was everything alright?
she was put out because i hadn't made the kids a cooked dinner .
she's mad about sunday dinners .
young phil's missing you ever so .
is he?
he woke up early this morning .
i could hear him talking away to himself in his cot .
he kept scolding you for not coming home .
ah , bless him !
i seem to have only just got here .
don't panic .
dirty beast !
the sister will give you your injection after tea .
tell her to send the blonde who's a good dart thrower .
you won't forget to write?
as soon as they've gone to school .
give my love to phil and shirley .
i will .
bye , love .
eat your eggs .
yeah , i will .
don't worry , i'll be alright in a minute .
don't worry , i'll look after him .
he hates me going .
i'll soon cheer him up .
thank you .
you get dependent on 'em coming , see .
and it don't do to get dependent on nobody in this life .
they bring fruit and flowers and say how well you look , and after five minutes , they're dying for the bell so they can get away .
i know , i've watched 'em .
they're no sooner out of the door than they say to each other ,
gawd , did you see old ned?
didn't he look rough?
keep them insurance policies dusted .
don't throw that black hat away .
i've heard 'em .
mr elkins .
hello , nurse .
you should be in bed .
i couldn't sleep , so i come down and made a cup of tea .
you're not supposed to .
i have been doing things all my life i'm not supposed to .
you know what?
i had an 'orrible nightmare .
you must have had too much supper .
no , serious .
i dreamt that the hydrogen bomb had fallen , and i didn't get killed .
but i got some of that dust on my shoulder , see?
i rushes in this house , shuts the door , and who's standing there?
little malcolm .
who?
oh , yeah .
it's this kid i used to know .
and then i realised that this ... this dust on me , this poison i've picked up , ... .. will kill him .
and i was taking it to him .
i was taking death to him .
but what could i do?
i had to save my bleeding self , didn't i?
made me feel rough , though .
it would make some sense to a psychiatrist .
you know what?
i wish just for once
i could get myself to do something good in my dreams .
it wouldn't cost me anything .
i'd get a great deal of satisfaction out of it .
they've got you when you're awake and when you're asleep . you'll be leaving here next month?
yeah .
i'll be glad to get back to london .
it won't be the same without you around here .
i ain't gone yet .
would you like me to give you something to make you sleep?
now , there's a good idea .
alright , then , come with me .
marvellous what you can get on the national health .
bye , mr elkins .
bye , mrs clamacraft .
bye bye , love .
you know something?
visiting days ain't doing you any good .
how do you mean?
takes you a week to get over one .
if you're not careful , you'll be leaving here in your wooden suit .
but that's all i live for , to see her and talk to her .
you've got to live for yourself , not for others .
you'd do without her if she got run over .
don't talk like that , alfie .
no .
all i'm saying is , it don't do to get attached to nobody like that in this life .
what your sort don't understand ...
what?
is ...
is the bond between husband and wife .
what i do understand is human bleeding nature .
how do you know your missus ain't got a geezer outside?
you say another word about my wife , i'll knock your bloody ... !
harry .
don't get aeriated .
harry , sit quiet .
here , have a fag .
the doc said not to smoke more than five a day .
take no notice of the doc .
you've got to get yourself better .
no , all i meant was , with a bird , you can never tell where it's been nor what it's done .
say " she .
you're talking about my wife .
she or it , they're all birds .
what you've got to do is start living for yourself .
like i do .
they won't keep me here long .
no , but , alfie , i miss the kids .
especially the youngest .
here , just listen to me .
just listen to me for a minute .
supposing tonight , you was to snuff it .
know what i mean?
you're a right 'un .
just supposing .
have a giggle .
that's all life is .
say your old woman picks up with a bloke and brings him home .
not lily !
she wouldn't .
why not?
she ain't bad .
she's got a fair little figure .
not my type , but still .
she brings this bloke home and introduces him to the kids as uncle bill .
your kids'd get a kick out of him .
not young phil .
he'd be the first if uncle bill brought some toys .
you wouldn't buy phil with toys !
then your missus tells the neighbours the kids need a dad .
she'd blame it on the kids .
what are you getting at?
i only want you to see the truth and start getting better .
for a month or two after you're gone , your wife and kids might take flowers to the cemetery , but once she's married again and the kids start calling uncle bill " dad " , your little grave will become just a mass of weeds .
if you walked into your home six months later , your kids'd ask uncle bill , " dad , who is it?
i'll knock your bloody head in !
you're driving me up the wall !
all i want is for you to see life , see what it is and what it does to you .
i never wanted to hurt you , harry .
i never want to hurt anybody .
no , i suppose not .
but you do , alfie .
you do .
want a game of draughts?
yeah , alright .
come on .
oi !
how are you?
alright .
look at you .
i feel alright .
i've got a gaff lined up for you .
i'm not used to all this noise .
i've had six months of peace and quiet and fresh air .
i'd be scared to take a car out now .
i've got just the job for you , all the fresh air you want .
street photography .
i do it myself .
up at tower hill .
tons of tourists .
chat the birds up easy .
they're asking for it .
nothing to it .
hold it , lady . little to the left .
three for 12 and a tanner .
i think these photographers are a damn nuisance .
i'm sure he's a nice gentleman .
you can have it on your own .
you got film in that camera?
are you loaded?
yeah .
good .
good morning to you .
nice to see you , madam .
come on , lady , give us a great big smile .
here you are , sir .
not today .
they won't bite .
i don't want my photograph taken .
what about the young lady?
nor does she .
how would you know that , sir?
what about it?
one on your jack ...?
on your own?
alright , i think i will .
vacationing?
no .
immigrant?
in a way .
married?
sometimes .
now?
no , not now .
how do you want me?
well , i've got two positions , straight up or sideways , depending on your nationality .
i'll have you against the ships .
alright .
i've always been partial to the navy .
you look a real treat there , you do .
ruby , we've no time to waste here .
it won't take a tick .
we've got a fast film in today .
allow me , madam .
he's getting a bit choked up .
well , don't let it worry you .
it doesn't worry me .
it doesn't seem to worry you , either .
i never let any man worry me .
i see what you mean .
now , that's lovely .
can you hold it?
i'll do my best , young man .
put a jerk in it !
i'll put a jerk in you .
hold it !
lovely .
that's a real beauty .
now the close up .
lick your lips .
strewth !
now , watch the dickie bird .
now , what's your address?
and your telephone number .
that's three of each .
it'll be 15 shillings , sir .
haven't you got any change?
no , i haven't !
i'll have to look for some .
keep the bloody change !
hello .
how about a little souvenir?
you can have an enlargement for four and six , sir .
i've got just the job for you , " nat says .
plenty of fresh air .
know what?
i got the flu twice in six weeks .
so i went back to the hire car lark .
with the rolls there .
oh , yeah .
it's very nice of you to come , alfie .
wasn't it , love?
yes , it was .
if i'd known you were gonna be here , i wouldn't have come .
i didn't mean that .
course not .
she looks real tired .
don't you think so , alfie?
i'm alright .
harry , you think about yourself , or you'll never get out of here .
yeah .
alfie , do you think you could give her a lift home in your car?
harry !
please !
no !
it's a long way for her by train .
yeah , i'll take her back .
it's a pleasure .
he'll take you back .
she didn't want to come and i didn't want to take her .
we both agreed to please harry .
looks real ribby , though , don't she?
to brighten her up , i'm taking her a roundabout way .
show her a bit of the scenery .
well , you can only try , can't you?
how would you like a nice cup of tea , girl?
i don't want to be any trouble .
that's alright .
one thing about driving a rolls , they're pleased to see you anywhere .
know what?
when she smiles that little smile of hers ,
i'm quite touched by it .
yeah .
now i look at her , she ain't so ugly after all .
it must be hard on you , girl , old harry being away so long . still , i'll say this for him , he could hardly wait for those visiting days to come round .
don't worry about him , lily .
he'll be home soon .
course he will .
cheer up .
well , what harm can it do?
old harry will never know .
and , even if he did , he shouldn't begrudge me .
nor her , come to that .
and it'll round off the tea nicely .
i don't know what you must think of me .
i bet you ain't been with many blokes besides harry .
i haven't been with anyone .
where you going , love?
london .
that's a big place for a little girl .
come on , hop in .
hello , frank .
what do you want to eat?
i'm not hungry .
just a cup of tea , please .
you must eat something .
no , thank you .
just tea with sugar .
wotcher , alfie .
how you doing?
you wanna watch your loading ropes frank , they look a bit dodgy .
ta .
what's the fancy dress for?
got a rolls outside , ain't i?
you're almost a stranger .
why didn't you turn up?
sorry , darling , i couldn't make it .
a small tea and a slice of buttered toast , please .
you won't get far on cups of tea .
i'll be alright .
who's the mystery?
that one , frank brought in .
watch it , alfie , that's frank's bird .
it's not my type , anyway .
i'll just go and check those ropes , see they're alright .
you ok?
bit dead in here , though , isn't it?
i think i'll have a tune .
they ain't half got some old ones , ain't they?
yes .
did you come in with frank?
yes .
why?
he's a good bloke , frank .
a good mate .
yes , he seems nice .
yeah .
he'd share his last cigarette with you .
very good hearted is frank .
you know what?
he'll even share his birds with his mates .
one bloke told me , he'll even lend you his wife .
like the eskimos do .
i wouldn't fancy that .
well , i mean , she's so bad tempered .
i didn't think he was married .
yes , he's got at least one wife .
being a long distance lorry driver , he's away from home most nights .
funny , some blokes , aren't they?
i wouldn't like sharing a girl , would you?
no !
no .
where are you making for?
well , london .
any particular place?
not really .
i'd like to get a room and a job if i could .
here , i might be able to help you .
i know the personnel officer of a big toffee factory .
a lovely little number .
could i see you in london?
i could take you down there .
i've got a rolls royce out there .
a radio , heater , the lot .
i should have to tell frank , first .
you daren't risk that . he'll knock your block off .
mine , too .
see that door there?
well , 50 yards down the road there's a telephone kiosk .
you wait for me there .
i don't like doing that .
don't be frightened of me .
i ain't a wolf , you know .
go on , before he comes back .
you don't want sharing , do you?
no .
of course you don't .
go on , away you go .
would you tell the driver i came in with that i've had to go?
i'll tell him .
how much i owe you , flo?
one and a penny .
you ain't going yet?
i'm in a hurry all of a sudden .
what about your toast?
give it to frank .
he could do with a slice .
see you .
see you , alfie .
did you see the way he lapped it up?
can't see what they all see in him .
frank'll go raving mad .
good .
sit back and enjoy yourself , girl .
do your folks at home know where you're going?
i haven't got any .
there must be somebody?
i want to make a new start in london .
i reckon you've landed on your feet . you'll have a great life with me .
it ain't come up too bad , has it?
all it needed was a good wash and a bit of care and attention .
it's quite dainty .
you know what i mean?
here , i no sooner take a pair of socks off than it washes 'em .
and it can cook , too .
a bit limited on the menu .
it goes in for lancashire hotpot and steak and kidney pie .
they blow you out a bit , but it does do a marvellous egg custard .
i ain't never tasted nothing like it .
it's pretty fair on the other , an 'all .
a bit on the shy side , but i find that makes quite a change these days .
oi .
turn it down a bit , annie .
it's in love , see .
now , when it listens to that stuff ,
it daydreams that the bloke who threw it over will one day want it back .
what a bleeding hope .
just watch how it works .
scrub , scrub , scrub .
it takes some birds like that .
not all of 'em .
can i get you a cup of tea , alfie?
take it easy !
you always want to be doing something .
here , i had a bird once , a big fat thing it was , got crossed in love or something .
the bigger they are , the harder they fall .
she used to sit in front of the fire , smoking cigarettes and drinking tea till her shins were burnt red raw .
give us a cup of tea , bracken shins , " i said to it once .
what? " it said , " you paralysed?
i soon got rid of it .
are you visiting your friend at the sanatorium?
old harry?
i thought i would .
you fancy a ride in the car , girl?
i've some washing to do .
you're always bleeding washing .
take a rest .
i feel better if i'm doing something .
well , if it makes you feel better , i'm not going to stop you .
punishes itself , you see .
that way life can't get at it the same .
what time will you be back?
you shouldn't ask me that .
when i go out , i don't know what day i'll be back , let alone what time .
i'm what is called a free agent .
sorry , alfie .
i just thought i'd have your meal ready .
make a meal that's always ready .
hash or stew or something .
i thought i'd do something special .
get those boots for me , girl .
see , even she's started asking me when i'll be back .
know what?
that little remark could be the writing on the wall .
annie?
when will you start using those gloves i bought you? you'll ruin your hands with all that scrubbing .
they don't matter .
they may not matter to you , but they matter to me .
nothing puts me off more than a woman getting hold of me with horny mitts .
you've got pretty little fingers .
they're like a child's .
look after 'em for me .
sometimes , it gets a dead ghostified look come over its little face , as though it were all sick inside with love , and its poor mind was stumbling about looking for a corner to rest in .
take the other night ...
after what we'd just been through , it made me really mad .
there's a time and a place for everything .
even your thoughts have a proper place .
sorry , alfie .
forget him , girl .
i'm here and in the flesh .
blimey !
she looked dead guilty .
know what?
i was sorry i spoke .
alfie " , i says to myself , " she's as human as you are .
well , i'll be off now , girl .
like to give me a brush down?
shall i say you'll be back about seven?
say what you like .
whether i'll be here or not is another matter .
you have something ready .
if i'm here i'll eat it .
you know what , annie?
you're a nice looking girl , only you want to brighten yourself up .
don't mope about depressed .
think of others .
so long .
take care of yourself , alfie .
i didn't like leaving it there on a sunday , scrubbing away , but what could i do?
you know what i mean?
i couldn't take it with me .
going up in the world , ain't i?
do you know what the rents are here?
15 quid a week !
that's including central heating , of course .
you'll never guess who i'm calling on . well , i wouldn't have believed it myself three months ago .
i'm here , girl .
that's life , isn't it?
you can never tell what's round the corner .
down one minute , up the next
you drop a tanner , look around , and what do you find?
ruby !
hello , baby !
hold it !
gotcha !
she's in lovely condition .
what are you so impatient about?
what do you think?
don't kiss my ear .
you know what it does to me !
what about it?
let's at least have a drink first .
whisky?
you haven't got a beer , have you?
yes , i've probably got a beer on the ice .
she gets all this lot off income tax .
business expenses , see?
she owns three hairdressers '.
the thing i like about ruby , she's a mature woman .
you can feel a lifetime of experience in her fingers .
know what i mean?
i find i'm going in more for that sort of woman now .
here , don't you dig your nails in like you did last thursday .
i've got scratches down my back .
i may do more than that today .
great long weals , they are .
she dug her nails right in .
she's had two husbands .
both dead .
and i've a good idea what they died of .
she don't keep asking do you love her like young birds do .
she don't never mention love .
she knows what she wants and she's gonna get it .
if there's any going .
cheers .
cheers .
alfie , don't you ever think about bringing your girlfriends flowers or candy?
i often think about it , but i never do it .
not unless they're in hospital .
don't put your wet glass on my polished table !
you're getting bleeding fussy .
i am not getting bleeding fussy .
you are .
i am not fussy !
hello !
she's in beautiful condition .
you're a little sexpot , ain't you?
am i?
yeah .
you're a little lust box , ain't you?
my little lust box !
i might settle down with her .
with a wife like ruby , you wouldn't want nothing on the side .
bedroom !
here , come and have a look at this a minute .
great , isn't it?
have you caught the ceiling?
look at the size of that bath !
king size .
a bit of a tight squeeze with two of us in it .
you can have a lot of fun splashing about and whatnot .
there have been times when i've felt lucky to get out of that bath alive .
hello , lads .
hello , alfie .
what you having?
brown ale .
have you got the car outside?
i don't think i'll go up the club .
i've got this northern bird , annie , staying at my gaff .
can't half cook .
cook? !
what's cooking got to do with it?
she don't like it if he don't come home for his meals .
eh , alfie?
no .
she does some handsome nosh ups .
steak and kidney pie , hotpot .
i love her cooking , i do .
i thought you was looking a bit blown out .
eh , vi?
what do you mean , blown out?
it's just the appearance , alfie .
what appearance? well , you look all puffed up .
blown out .
sort of ... poncified .
poncified?
i've never felt fitter in all my life .
he wasn't saying you wasn't fit .
no .
you just look different , that's all .
don't he , vi?
what's bleeding different?
that bird annie's putting the block on you , mate , and you can't see it .
what do you say , perce?
looks that way .
she's only looking after me .
in 12 months , you won't recognise yourself .
you'll be stuffed to the ears with hotpot .
how you going , mate?
i thought it was you .
remember that day you came in the busy bee?
what day was that?
couple of weeks back .
you was in a chauffeur's uniform .
oh , yeah .
what about it?
did you slope off with a little girl from sheffield called annie when my back was turned?
who , me?
no , i don't know what you're talking about .
you're a bloody liar !
watch the suit .
it's just back from the cleaner's .
is that you , alfie?
yeah , it's me .
i'm late , ain't i?
start rucking me !
what happened?
you've got an awful black eye .
blimey !
he's injured me for life !
where's that steak you bought?
i've made you steak and kidney pie .
i'm fed up with hotpots and steak and kidney pies !
why can't we have something out of a can for a change?
corned beef or spam .
handsome grub , that was .
you said you liked my steak and kidney pies .
if i get that lot on top of a skinful of beer , i can hardly draw my breath !
i'll get an 'orrible feeling of being full up , blown out , poncified .
you said you loved that feeling of being full .
what i loved once and what i love now are two different things .
where's my button down shirt?
your blue one?
in the drawer .
no , the pink one .
i washed it . it'll soon be dry .
why did you wash it?
i only wore it for a few hours .
i thought it'd feel fresher for you .
i do believe you only wash to fill in your bleeding time !
why should i?
to get him out of your mind !
get who out of my mind?
that bleeding tony you write about in your little diary !
you can't get outta your mind or something !
alfie , have you been in my bag and read my diary?
why shouldn't i?
you shouldn't because them's my secret thoughts .
you ain't entitled to secret thoughts living with me !
everyone's entitled to them .
then you shouldn't write them down and let me see 'em !
i only wrote them to get them out of me .
i'll show you what i think of you , your secret thoughts and your bleeding steak and kidney pie !
and don't take nothing that don't belong to you , either !
don't let your custard spoil .
it's in the oven .
annie?
annie?
come back !
i didn't mean it !
come in .
you're a bit early , girl .
i didn't want to be late .
is he coming?
yeah , about two o'clock , he said .
here , give us your bag .
blimey !
your hands ain't half cold .
you ain't worrying , are you?
a bit .
yeah , you're all dark under the eyes .
i couldn't sleep last night .
well ...
and you can get ready for him when you want to .
thanks .
i've let myself in for something this time alright .
it was that day i took her up the river , see .
round about three months ago , it was .
that was something i thought i got for nothing .
but it don't never work out that way , does it?
so , i agrees to help her and lay it all on . well , it was the least i could do , knowing old harry , an 'all .
see what i mean?
come in , mate .
well , here we are .
what do you mean , here we are?
i mean you've come to the right place .
and this is the young lady i talked to you about on the phone .
pleased to meet you .
got your gear with you?
don't ask questions .
sorry .
this is the room where you can examine this young lady .
and why should i examine this young lady?
well , you got to , ain't you , before you do it?
before i do what?
do what you've come to do .
quiet , alfie .
there must be some mistake .
you are the gentleman i talked to last thursday night?
alfie , please , be quiet .
don't worry , my dear .
now , i must have a serious talk with you both .
are you two married?
us two married? !
blimey !
do we look it?
no .
i mean , she's a married woman , but i'm a single man .
is there any chance of you getting married in the near future?
i very much doubt that .
what do you say , lily?
but you are the putative father?
the what?
me? !
i'm nothing .
i'm just obliging a friend .
well , that's unusual .
it's very unusual .
you are the man who ... is going to help me?
her old man's in a sanatorium , see?
and she's had a moral lapse .
see what i mean?
i'm not quite sure that i do .
it'll never happen again .
she needs helping because her marriage would look very dodgy if her husband came out at this stage of the game .
got me?
she's got three other kids as well .
and where do you fit into all this?
well , she had no place to go , see?
well , that's most altruistic .
i hope you both appreciate the seriousness of this case .
to terminate a pregnancy after 28 days is a criminal offence punishable in a court of law with seven years 'jail .
do you understand this , you two?
yeah .
not only that , but it's a crime against the unborn child .
it's a course never to be embarked upon lightly .
you must consider the circumstances thoroughly before you go through with your decision .
since afterwards it will be too late to change your mind .
have you given the matter your fullest consideration?
what do you say , lily?
i've no way out .
then you've decided to go through with it?
yes , i must .
then i might be able to help you .
thank you .
yes .
have you got the money?
yeah , the money .
the young lady's got it .
that'll be 30 .
25 .
that's the figure we discussed .
very well , then , 25 .
right .
very well .
right , young lady , would you care to follow me?
i'll need some boiling water .
the kettle's on the stove in there .
good .
i hate anything like this .
my understanding of women only goes as far as the pleasure .
when it comes to the pain , i'm like every other bloke .
i don't wanna know .
have you done? !
almost everything i can do .
can she go home now , then?
lord , no !
it's only been induced .
it hasn't happened yet .
that comes later .
if her temperature rises rapidly , give her two of these .
i'll leave you six .
how will i know? well , if she starts to sweat , give her two .
here , mate .
shouldn't you see the job through , considering how much you've been paid?
two if she sweats .
how you feeling , girl?
he gave me these tablets to give to you .
take two if your temperature goes up .
you do look old , girl .
he got his money easy .
not so loud .
my landlady'll hear !
i can't help it !
this pain !
lily !
this pain !
i can't help .. !
i'm sorry , lily .
i'm sorry .
i had to do it .
if my landlady heard , she'd have the ambulance here !
doctors , police , the lot !
all this would have been for nothing !
see what i mean?
that's why i had to do it .
is there something i can get you , lily?
would you like a cup of tea?
no .
you go .
i'm better on my own .
there's nothing you can do .
you'll be alright , will you?
you're sure you'll be alright?
i know it don't look nice , going off and leaving her .
but what do look nice when you get close up to it?
come on , malcolm !
you naughty boy !
you're keeping everyone waiting .
suzanne elizabeth , i baptise thee in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost .
amen .
and now we join together in the family prayer of christians .
our father , which art in heaven ,
hallowed be thy name .
thy kingdom come , thy will be done , on earth as it is in heaven ...
who's daddy's best boy , eh?
who's daddy's best boy?
who's the best boy in the world?
lily?
is it all over?
yes .
i'll be ready to go in a minute .
there's no hurry , girl .
no hurry .
don't .
don't go in there .
i could have dropped on the spot with the shock .
all i was expecting to see was ...
come to think of it , i don't rightly know what i was expecting to see .
certainly not this perfectly formed being .
i half expected it to cry out .
it didn't , of course .
it couldn't have done .
it could never have had any life in it .
not a proper life of its own .
no , i suppose not .
still ... .. it must have had some life , of course .
and ... as it lay there so quiet and so still ... .. it quite touched me .
and i started praying or something .
saying things like , " god help me ! " and things like that .
and then i starts to cry .
straight up .
the tears were running down my face .
all salty .
like i was a kid myself .
crying for him , you mean , alf?
no , not for him .
he was past it .
for my bleeding self !
you know , it don't half bring it home to you what you are when you see a helpless little thing like that lying in your own hands .
he'd have been quite perfect .
and i thought to myself ,
you know what , alfie?
you know what you done?
you murdered him .
well , there's nothing you can do about it now , alf .
will you lend me 25 quid , nat?
don't be bloody funny !
that's all i've got in the world .
take this watch as security .
if i haven't paid you back in two weeks , you can sell it .
i don't want no security .
i'll give you the money .
thanks very much , nat .
well , that's that .
you all ready?
come on , i'll run you home .
i'd sooner go on my own .
you say that again , you will go home on your own .
i want to .
ok by me .
there's a bus to waterloo or a green line all the way .
here .
this is for little phil .
who?
phil , your youngest .
the one who writes all them squiggly letters .
what is it?
you wanna see it?
i bought it a long , long time ago .
for a little kid i used to know .
catch .
tell him it's from his uncle alfie .
come on , mate .
i'll take you home .
i'm definitely gonna settle down with this ruby .
i'm fed up with being on the move .
you know , i find i'm not stalking these young birds any more .
ruby !
where are you , girl?
alfie?
i thought i'd give you a surprise .
i'll be right out !
make yourself a drink .
alright .
i was sleeping .
i've got a headache .
i took a pill .
oh , i'm sorry .
you said you were on a job today .
it fell through .
want a drink?
no thanks .
you better go , darling .
i've got a splitting headache .
alright .
you better have these now i've brought 'em .
alfie , what a thing for you to do .
i never thought i'd live to see the day .
i like surprising a woman .
you did that .
look at the wrapper .
they're not off a barrow .
i can see that .
they're lovely .
really lovely .
thank you .
i'll go .
you take an aspirin , girl .
i will .
that's new .
new?
what?
that radio .
where did you get that?
i picked it up cheap .
will you ring me tomorrow?
i'll be alright then .
i'll come around lunch time .
we might have a session .
yeah , why not?
right .
see you .
alfie?
yeah?
i'm sorry about the headache .
i'll make it up to you .
sure .
what's that?
what?
that?
it's a guitar .
you doing it with groups now?
don't be so disgusting !
and the radio .
you've got a bloke in there , ain't you?
it's none of your business !
you pick him up cheap , too?
there is no one in there !
i honestly thought you had a headache .
what a mug i've grown into !
get out of here !
i have a splitting headache !
why him?
better than me?
what's he got that i haven't?
apart from long hair?
well?
come on , let's have it .
what's he bleeding got?
he's younger than you are .
you got it?
he's younger than you are .
that's what she said .
anybody would think i was doddering about on crutches .
trouble is , i still keep thinking about her .
i can't get her out of my mind .
who'd have thought a ruddy great lust box like her would have found her way into anybody's feelings?
she might have looked a hard case , but underneath she was quite mumsy .
and she was in beautiful condition .
do you know , i'm beginning to think she was beautiful .
after all , it ain't through the eyes that you feel beauty , it's how the heart hungers for something that makes it beautiful .
oi !
siddie .
alfie .
hello .
i ain't seen you in ages .
you didn't turn up .
look , i can explain that .
i ain't half missed you .
i like that gear .
where you going?
i've got the car round the corner .
what about it?
i can't , i'm gonna meet my husband .
it's nice material .
still , you always was a snappy dresser .
what about sunday , then?
no , i'm not sure .
come on .
same time , same place?
we'll see .
i'll wait for you for five minutes .
don't forget your napkin .
i'm like the boy scouts , i am , always prepared .
see you , then?
maybe .
you know what?
when i look back on my little life and the birds i've known , and think of all the things they've done for me and the little i've done for them , you'd think i'd had the best of it all along the line .
but what have i got out of it?
i've got a bob or two , some decent clothes , a car .
i've got my health back and i ain't attached .
but i ain't got my peace of mind .
and if you ain't got that , you ain't got nothing .
i don't know , it seems to me that if they ain't got you one way , they've got you another .
so what's the answer?
that's what i keep asking myself .
what's it all about?
know what i mean?
come on , boy .
