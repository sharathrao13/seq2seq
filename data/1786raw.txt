my name is pacu ,
it's a brand new name , so i'm not used to it yet ,
i'm trying to remember a story ,
sometimes i can , sometimes i get mixed up ,
because there's another one stuck in my head ,
it's about me , my brother , and a shirt in the wind ,
the blood is starting to turn yellow .
yah !
yah !
yah !
yah !
yah !
yah !
yah !
yah !
it's pa who drives the oxen 'round the mill ,
in grandpa's time , the slaves did all the work ,
now we do it .
tonio , my brother , crushes the sugarcane ,
ma gathers the scraps ,
bring more cane , kid .
hurry up !
let's go , blocky !
turn , turn !
ma says god never gives us ... heavier burdens than we can bear ,
but god keeps messing up ,
he sometimes dumps such burdens on us , we all collapse ,
we live in stream of souls ,
it's in the middle of nothing ,
all we know is it's above the ground and below the sun ,
it's so hot that it sets our hearts boiling ...
like a pot of molasses ,
tonio , i dreamed about incio again ,
go back to sleep now .
go on , kid .
and now , sleep .
go on , go on !
the blood has turned yellow .
tonio ... you know what you have to do .
don't go , tonio .
your brother's soul isn't at rest .
he did what he had to do .
it's tonio's turn now .
don't go .
listen to me , kid ,
your grandfather , your uncles , your oldest brother ... all died for this land and for our honor .
one day , it could be you .
you're a breves ,
i , too , did my duty .
but it wasn't god's will that i die .
tonio , you'll leave at daybreak ,
and remember ... you're only to seek out your brother's killer .
man to man , face to face .
tonio will be walking over land that used to be ours ,
the ferreiras took it from us and we took it back ,
now it's theirs again ,
that's how the feud began ,
pa says it's an eye for an eye ,
one of theirs for one of ours ... and so on , until everyone ended up blind ,
in the land of the blind ... one eyed people are said to be mad ,
mo ther , ; may god consent , may it be god's will ,
may the soul of incio , my first born ... find peace alongside his own .
may each drop of his blood cost the enemy two .
may you , my son ... find the peace you never found among the living .
and watch over your brothers when their turn comes ,
we're going for water .
yes , sir .
everything quiet?
guard , ; yes , sir ,
like this .
go outside , kid .
for my brother !
i won't pray for your grandson's soul , since he killed my son .
but i respect your suffering .
it's the same as mine .
today , ours is greater .
my son asks permission to attend the vigil ... to pray for the deceased's soul .
afterwards , if you accept , he'd like to talk to you .
where is he?
outside .
thank you .
good bye , my friend .
i prayed for the deceased .
i came to the wake and the burial .
now , i'd like to talk to you .
i request a truce .
grandfather , don't accord a truce .
the truce is granted .
the same one your father granted to my grandson .
until the next moon .
from one death to the next .
this is your guarantee until the full moon .
after that , when the blood turns yellow , it will expire .
how old are you?
twenty .
your life is now split in two .
the twenty years you've already lived ... and the short time you have left .
have you ever known love?
you never will .
do you hear that clock?
each time it ticks one more , one more , one more ... it will be telling you ... one less , one less , one less .
whoa .
good morning .
morning .
do you know of a little village ... near here called born sossago?
it's over there .
but it's not little .
it's not?
what's this place called?
stream of souls .
so where's the stream?
dried up .
only the souls remain .
what is your name?
kid .
what?
i don't have a name .
what do they call you?
they just call me kid .
they call the kid " kid .
kid !
here , this is for you .
can you read?
no .
but i can read pictures .
hey , kid !
stay away from those vagrants !
ma thinks the bloodstain will come out ,
but it won't come out ,
you did your duty , my son ,
now you have much to do before the next moon .
crush the sugarcane and fix the roof ... in case it rains this year .
it never rains .
then the raw sugar has to be sold in the village .
that sounded like a bad dream , tonio ,
i tried to wake you up , but you didn't want to ,
what are you doing up , kid?
reading .
where'd you get that?
a present .
from who?
the girl gave it to me .
what girl?
my friend , of course .
you went into town alone?
no .
they were lost .
but not anymore .
i showed them the way .
hmm .
so what's that book about?
it's about everything .
something's wrong , kid .
what's wrong?
it's upside down .
no , it's not .
want to bet?
it's the same this way ... or that way .
no difference , see?
you don't know a thing about books .
give it to me .
it's her !
tonlo , ; her?
who?
the girl who gave me the book .
she lives in the sea with the fish , the crabs , and the boats .
she'll take me with her .
she'll teach me the alphabet and all .
you don't believe me?
when i grow up , we'll get married .
has she been informed?
no .
it's still a secret .
one day ... the mermaid comes up to the surface .
and she saw the tree , the cows , the mountains , and grass .
when she looked at the top of the raw sugar house ... she saw the rooster with the mangy neck crowing for her .
ahh .
wow , she really liked that !
and she also saw the sugarcane , the mill ... everything delighted her !
but the best part of all was when she saw the kid .
are you still reading that book?
can't you see it will hurt your eyes?
i'm trying to remember the story .
sometimes i can , sometimes i forget .
then just forget .
well?
it is beginning to change color .
it won't take long now .
no , it won't .
you're the most important merchant in town ... but with all due respect , this isn't the right amount .
mr , loureno , ; no , it is the right amount ,
but i gave you the usual quantity .
steam power is bringing the price down .
it's progress .
i think you should follow the example , mr. breves .
but mr. loureno , we had an agreement .
there is no shortage of raw sugar !
come on up !
come one , come all , if you want to watch ... the snake and the toad dance !
everyone will come .
together we will go .
tomorrow night , no one will sleep .
no man , no woman , no child .
come one , come all !
to the circus !
mr. loureno wants to decide other people's suffering .
i saw her .
who?
the mermaid .
up on stilts .
on what?
she's in the circus .
yeah?
they're bringing the circus to town ... with a fire eater , a clown ... and a snake that dances with a toad .
a snake with a what?
a toad .
yeah?
hey , are you daydreaming , kid?
more cane !
keep turning !
hurry up with that cane !
tonio .
i want to go to the circus real bad .
you think pa will let you?
we're like oxen here .
we go 'round and 'round and never go anywhere .
let's go , kid .
you want to see the circus?
hmm?
then let's go .
see?
i told you , she's hot stuff .
fire !
fire !
i'll be damned !
i'm toasted !
salustiana , look who's here .
hey !
it's the kid without a name .
anything's better than " salustiana .
my name's clara .
what's yours?
that's tonio , my brother .
good evening .
did you like the show?
i liked the fire best .
you're really hot !
holy shit !
i brought the book so you can remind me of the story .
it's late now .
salus tlana , ; hey , kid ...
i'm going to give you a name .
a name all your own .
what's your favorite animal?
do you like birds?
he only likes sea creatures .
oh , yeah?
then i'll name you sardine !
ha ha !
you bullshitting me?
we'll choose another name .
pacu .
pacu !
i've christened you ,
you have a name now .
and i'm your godfather ,
hmm !
to celebrate your christening !
i don't like it , tonlo , ; what?
the name .
pacu .
he's pulling my leg .
pacu is a kind of river fish .
tonio .
do you think they sleep together?
i don't know .
all i know is , he's your godfather now .
pacu .
pacu !
pacu !
ha ha !
cut it out , will you?
where'd you take the kid?
where?
to the circus .
where?
the circus .
go to your room , kid .
right now !
having fun at a time like this?
have you no respect for our dead?
you should follow your older brother's example .
don't worry .
i'll soon be like him .
shut up .
sorry , but i won't shut up .
shut your mouth .
no !
shut up !
no !
shut up !
tonlo , ; no !
i won't !
shut up !
tonio ,
you have to go away .
did you see his black armband?
yes .
he won't be around much longer .
what are you talking about?
it's true .
it's a family feud .
one side kills , then the other .
how do you know?
it goes way back .
they're fighting for the land .
they'd rather kill than solve their problems .
real fanatics .
it's like the two snakes i saw fighting .
each was biting the tail of the other .
they ate each other up until nothing was left .
nothing but a pool of blood on the ground .
they'll all be killed off .
hmm .
i feel sorry for them .
i really do .
yah !
stay in line !
keep it going , slowpoke !
you're lagging !
keep turning !
come on , blocky !
keep it going !
come on , slowpoke !
get up , slowpoke !
that's good , my ox .
tonio !
the oxen are going 'round on their own !
need some help?
i can always use help .
especially if it's free .
where's my godson?
at home .
come for the circus?
heh !
you'll have to wait till next year .
we're off to ventura for the festival .
ever been to ventura?
no .
i haven't been anywhere .
were you born dead or alive?
what?
were you born dead or alive?
alive .
well , i was born dead .
true or false?
true , i'm afraid .
ha ha !
let me explain .
my mother almost died giving birth .
i was born purple so purple they thought i was dead .
true or false?
they ignored me for two hours while trying to save my mother .
then they decided to wash me so i'd look decent for the funeral .
as soon as i felt the cold water , i started howling .
as a result , that was my first and last bath .
no more baths !
nothing bothers me .
anyone born dead has been through the worst .
after that , life's a breeze .
no kidding !
so when it comes to water ...
i don't even use it for drinking !
ha ha ha !
yuck !
let's go , bootleg !
how long do you have?
not long .
i'll go as far as ventura , then i have to go back ,
salus tlana , ; clara ... where are you?
in this house , the dead command the living .
sometimes i wish tonio wouldn't come back .
don't say that , woman .
even the worst life is better ... than being slaughtered like an animal .
look around you , woman .
what do we have left?
nothing .
you see , we've already lost everything .
and if tonio doesn't come back , we'll have lost our honor , too .
let's go , bootleg !
come on , bootleg !
sleep well , young man?
the mermaid coul dn't live on land ... because she had a fish tail ... where her legs should be .
the poor thing couldn't walk .
even so , one day she got furious and jumped out of the sea !
she started fighting with snakes and toads .
then , because she missed the kid so much ... she started puffing out fire and smoke .
so the kid got on a tired ol d ox ... and galloped after the mermaid ,
do dum , do dum , looking for the mermaid .
he went through the woods , the cane fields ... and when he parted the last row of sugarcane ... he came upon the sea .
and he found the mermaid .
following in your brother's footsteps?
think you can just take it easy around here?
give me my book !
give it to me !
give me my book !
give it to me !
group , ; die , you rabid dog !
take that !
to hell with the traitor !
hah !
don't tell me this shitty circus is still around ,
what did you say?
you heard me ,
shit what?
circus !
get out of here !
you lousy bum !
ha ha ha !
reginaldo .
come here !
shitty things are impossible to get rid of .
like you .
you mean like you .
reglnaldo , ; is that clara?
your stepdaughter?
spitting image of her mother .
reglnaldo , ; how she's grown !
do it right , kid .
you're big enough now .
come , tonio .
i'm going to show you something , tonio .
help me .
pull on the rope .
clara , ; start turning ,

i'll never forget this ... or you .
neither will i , tonio .
clara !
yah !
yah !
yah !
yah !
yah !
whoa .
yah !
the shirt is almost yellow now .
it always turns yellow .
with your permission ...
i could get the men together ... and wipe those breves from the face of this earth ,
i'll repeat this one last time ,
blood has the same volume for everyone .
you have no right to take more than the blood taken from you .
otherwise , you'll pay twice in this life and in the next .
that's what my father taught me and his father taught him .
and that's how it'll be until i die .
i taught you how to fly with this , remember?
you were scared shitless .
tonio , today it's your turn .
huh?
you take my place , i'll take yours .
no , i don't want to .
just once .
ooh !
tonio !
tonio .
tonio .
tonio .
tonio .
huh !
you're too damn strong .
no , you just forgot how to fly .
let me , it's my turn !
ooh , it's hot !
ha ha !
hey !
this is my favorite part of the show .
ha ha !
come on !
who's next !
keep filling it !
fill it up !
you can't do this .
anyhow , he's already dead .
but i'm not .
it's turned yellow .
is it reall yellow now?
yes , it's yellowed ,
you know what you have to do , then .
yes , i know .
tonio , you know the truce ends today .
from now on , it depends on the shirt .

stay close to me , and always carry the gun ,
it's going to rain .
no , it's not the rainy season .
i know it's going to rain .
tonio?

then talk in silence .

the mermaid , the ships damn !
the kid coul dn't find the mermaid ... no , it wasn't like that ,
damn ,
it's the mermaid who came looking yeah , that's it ,
i think i'm remembering it !
one day , the mermaid came and took him to live with her ,
and he reall y liked that !
she turned the kid into a fish ... and took him to live in the east , at the sea ,
in the sea , everyone wasn't dying all the time ,
there was a lot of room for everyone ,
in the sea , they lived so happil y ... so happil y , they coul dn't stop laughing ,
ha ha ha !
ha ha ha ,
in the sea , they were so happy , so happy together ... they couldn't help laughing .
