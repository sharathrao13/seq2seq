67 years of life , 46 years of marriage ,
you mean to tell me you never once suffered from piles?
well , it's the human condition ,
most humans , anyhow ,
like that ballplayer said , " the world's got two kind of folks ,
them that's got the piles and them that's goin 'get 'em ,
but you always was healthy as a ox ,
passed on 'fore you could get the piles ,
ooh , thank the lord you never was sick ,
i just want to pass away nice and peaceful ,
go to sleep one night , wake up in the glory land !
whoo !
pickles !
go fetch pickles !
pickles?
oh , he's up that tree again !
you'd better shimmy on up ,
well , i do apologize , madam , but , won't the feline eventually tire of his lonely perch and , pining for his master's affection , return on his own initiative?
uh , the point being , must we actually ascend the tree?
look , i don't want no doubletalk ,
now , if you not gon 'fetch him , i guess i gotta call the police ,
police?
and they not goin 'be happy ,
every time they have to fetch him , they swear they'll never do it no more ,
no need to call the authorities , madam ,
i did this often as a child ,
i was a positive lemur , here , kitty !
oh , don't upset him now !
i wouldn't think of it , madam ,
harmless little felix domesticus ,
here , kitty , come to g , h ,
come , come , here , kitty , here , kitty ,
come , come , come , no , no , no ,

yes , y , ah !
uh , thank you , madam , for your act of kindness ,
well , you let him out , i certainly did , and for that i apologize no end ,
allow me to present myself , um , formally ,
goldthwait higginson dorr , ph , d ,
like elmer?
i beg your pardon , ma'am?
fudd ,
no , no , ph , d , is a mark of academic attainment bestowed , in my case , in recognition of my mastery of the antique languages of latin and greek ,
i also hold a number of other advanced degrees , including the baccalaureate from a school in paris , france , called the sorbonne ,
sore bone , well , that fits ,
you ever study at bob jones university?
i have not had that privilege ,
oh , that's a bible school , only the finest in the country ,
i send 'em $5 every month , that is very generous ,
i'm on the mailin 'list !
i'm a angel , are you?
yes ,
oh , they list my name in the newsletter every issue ,
do they?
oh , i got the literature right over here ,
if you'd like to examine it , perhaps when my head has recovered from its , uh , uh , buffeting ,
mrs , munson , are you at all curious as to why i darkened your door , as the expression would have it , on this lovely , lovely camellia scented morn?
well , i was wonderin 'till you let pickles out ,
i quite understand , then in all the excitement ,
the fact is , i saw the sign in your window advertising a room to let?
and there are no other such signs among the houses
on this charming , charming street , yeah , i got a room , $15 a week , i'm lookin 'for a quiet tenant ,
madam , you are addressing a man who is quiet and yet not quiet , if i may offer a riddle ,
i am currently on sabbatical from the institution where i teach , the university of mississippi at hattiesburg ,
i am takin 'a year off to indulge my passion , and i do not believe that is too strong a word , for the music of the renaissance ,
i perform in , and have the honor of directing , a period instrument ensemble that performs at renaissance fairs and other cultural for a throughout central and southern mississippi ,
we perform on the instruments for which the music was originally composed ,
now , wait a minute , you got some kind of band?
oh , no , the word " band " would be , in this context , something of a misnomer ,
though we do play together , hence the word " ensemble " , the nature of the music is such that , well , one would hesitate to apply the epithet " band
with connotations of janglin 'rhythms , so y'all ain't playin 'no hippity hop?
i left my wallet in el segundo " , songs with the titles spelled all funny?
oh , no , no , we play music that has been composed to the greater glory of god ,
devotional music , church music ,
gospel music?
well , inspired by the gospel , certainly ,
the vintage , of course , is no more recent than the rococo ,
rococo , huh?
well , i guess that'd be ok ,
but i don't propose to inflict our rehearsals on you ,
may i inquire , do you have a root cellar?
ah , yes ,
yes , yes ,
this looks promising ,
a little dank , ain't it?
indeed , that only improves the acoustics ,
marvelous ,
yes , ah !
oh , these earthen walls are ideal for baffling the higher registers of the , uh , lute or sackbut ,
that is why so much music of the cinquecento was played in crypts and catacombs , this is ideal , this is perfect , this is more than perfect ,
i can scarcely contain my glee , oh , you containin 'it ok ,
you gotta peel this shit out , man , sometimes it stick to the bottom ,
hey , this shit smells like piles ,
you wouldn't even believe this , man , even out here on the casino floor you gonna find goddamn mercy pads , tucks ,
i don't know what the fuck people be doin 'here while they gamblin ',
man , i ain't peelin 'no funky shit with my human hands ,
that ain't nothin 'but a prescription for diseases and viruses
and shit attackin 'your fuckin 'insides , oh , well , shit , you gotta do it ,
'cause mr , gudge checks everything ,
this tunnel leads back onto the land for all the people that work for mannex ,
mannex corporation , they own the bandit queen , three other boats ,
now , this is where they think on their corporate shit , gudge and them ,
i mean , the light's as ugly as all hell , but , shit , ain't as many tucks ,
let me in , motherfucker !
what's the password?
kiss my ass !
now , this is where they count the dough , now , if you try to take any of it ,
elron over there'll shoot yo 'ass , goddamn !
dawg , this is a motherfuckin 'pigsty , man !
you are a squeakyass , motherfuckin 'pig !
man , look at your ass , you got cocoa krispies on your uniform ,

world war i vintage gas mask ,
it's authentic , strapped on , of course , so it can't fall off ,
now , the animal is free to be as active as he wants ,
it doesn't inhibit his movement in any way , and , , i think it really sells the whole doughboy thing ,
it looks like a fucking joke , uh , you're absolutely right ,
the gas mask is a whimsical concept ,
how the hell does it eat when it gets to the nibbles ready to eat?
well , you're absolutely right , don't let the clients see this ,
or that humane fucker , no , of course not ,
they'll just shut the fuckin 'spot down , pancake , they'll shut , , shut the fuckin 'spot down , ok?

i know you all remember that when moses came down the mountain carrying the word of god , come down that sinai peak ,
he caught them israelites red handed , yes !
what'd he catch 'em doin '?
he caught 'em worshippin '
a golden calf , yes !
he caught 'em worshippin 'a false god ,
he caught them israelites in decline ,
in decline !
what did moses do when he saw those , declinin ', backslidin ', never mindin 'sinners?
what did he do?
mosses smote those sinners in his wrath !
yes , he did !
y'all know what " smote " is?
i smite , you smite , he smites , we done smote !
to smite is to go upside the head !
because sometimes , brothers and sisters , that's the only way !
the only way ,
to smite is to remind we got to stop that decline and scramble back up to the face of the almighty god !
amen !
instead of worshippin 'that golden calf , that earthly trash on that garbage island ,
that garbage island in the shadowland , wa a ay ,
way outside the kingdom of god !
that garbage island , where scavenger birds feast on the bones of the backslidin 'damned !
and so , let us pray ,
my dear lady , i do so hope this is not an inopportune time for our first practice ,
somebody die?
i beg your pardon?
oh !
no , no , no , no , i'm not bereaved ,
though it is so kind of you to inquire , the hearse is simply a vehicle commodious enough to accommodate all the members of our ensemble ,
and , of course , our instruments contrived in an age ignorant of miniaturization ,
allow me to introduce my friends , my colleagues , these devoted and passionate musicians ,
ain't no smokin 'in this house ,
oh , sorry ,
what do you think , general?
present any problems?
good then , gentlemen , why don't we crowd around and go over the plan?
gentlemen , this is the bandit queen , gambling den , cash cow ,
sodom of the mississippi delta and the focus of our little exercise ,
here is orchard street ,
here is the residence of marva munson , the charming lady whom you all met moments ago ,
gentlemen , i'm sure you're all aware that the solons of the state of mississippi , to wit , its legislature , have decreed that no gaming establishment shall be erected within its borders upon dry land ,
they may , however , legally float ,
while the gambling activity is restricted to these riverboats , no such restrictions apply to the functions ancillary to this cash besotted business ,
the casino's offices , locker rooms , facilities to cook and clean , and , most importantly , its counting houses , the reinforced , secret , super secure repositories of the lucre , may all be situated , wherever ,
gawain , where is " wherever "?
say what?
where's the money?
oh ,
ok , look , at the end of every shift , pit boss brings the cash down to the hold of the ship in a locked cashbox , and once a day all the cash is moved down to the countin 'room ,
and where is the counting room?
uh , it be right there in that square where you pointin ',
and what , to flog a horse that if not dead is at this point in mortal danger of expiring , does this little square represent?
offices , underground ,
ha !
underground !
underground ,
during the casino's hours of operation , the door to this counting room is fiercely guarded ,
the door itself is of redoubtable pittsburgh steel ,
when the casino closes this entire underground complex is locked up , and the armed guard retreats to the casino's main entrance ,
there , then , far from the guard , reposes the money , behind a five inch thick steel portal , yes , but the walls , the walls are but humble masonry behind which is only the soft , loamy soil deposited over centuries by the old man , the meanderin 'mississippi , as it fanned its way back and forth across the great alluvial plain , leaving earth ,
this earth ,
the general here , whose curriculum vitae comprehends massive tunnelin 'experience through the soil of his native french indochina , shall be directin 'our little old tunnelin 'operation ,
garth pancake , though a master of none , is a jack of all those trades corollary to our aim ,
he will be doin 'such fabricatin 'and demolition work
as our little caper shall require , happy to be on board ,
gawain is our proverbial " inside man ,
he has managed to secure himself a berth on the custodial staff of the bandit queen ,
damn skippy !
and this brings us to lump ,
to look at lump , you might wonder what specialized expertise could he possibly offer our merry little old band of miscreants ,
well , gentlemen , in a project of such risks , it is imperative to enlist the services of a hooligan , a goon , an ape , a physical brute ,
someone who will be our security , our battering ram , our blunt instrument ,
and , on our behalf , i wish him a warm mississippi welcome ,
fuckin 'a , whassup , my nigga?
well , gentlemen , here you are ,
men of different backgrounds and differing talents ,
one , you all saw fit to answer my advertisement in the memphis scimitar , and two , you're all going to be , in consequence , very , very , incredibly , rich ,
let us revel in our adventure , gentlemen ,
let us make beautiful music together , and , by all means , let us keep this to ourselves ,
what we say in this root cellar , let it stay in this root cellar ,
there's no " l " in " team " ,
trouble in and trouble out
trouble's wwhat this wworld's about
troubles of this world the devil's in this world
trouble in , trouble out
trouble's wwhat this wworld's about
troubles of this world the devil's in this world
you up the river without a paddle in a lot of trouble
without a doubt you going under running out of bubbles
pass me the body bag watch me dump 'em
it ain't nothing for you to get squashed like a pumpkin
i try so hard and play my cards afraid to fall , i ain't involved
i gotta call i'm much appalled
i came to o z and broke the laws
bring on the casket ain't too glad
'cause dirty hazard wrapped in plastic
it's ok , don't stop on account of me ,
no , no , no , no , no , not at all , madam ,
not at all , we were about to take a break anyway ,
the glissandi on this particular piece are technically very , very demanding , and i'm sure we would all welcome a moment of r and r ,
well , i just thought maybe you'd like to see ,
what have you gotten into , honey?
why you sweating like that?
uh , uh ,
uh , eh , 'cause , 'cause , that boy right there?
he plays one bitch barrel full of a sackbut !
ain't that right , lump?
uh huh ,
i'm tellin 'you , he can tear it up , right , lump?
ain't nobody play the sackbut like lump right there , he ,
hoo hoo hoo !
don't be shy , lump , don't be shy , lump , that boy , he go , at it like it was some pussy !
oh , shit !
mind your mouth !
this is a christian house , boy , no hippity hop language in here ,
sometime it's the only way , now listen , you ain't gonna hit me ,
i'm tryin 'to help you , boy , better yourself !
and so you should , madam , so you should ,
gawain is so far transported by his love of the music of the early renaissance ,
don't make me no never mind , he transported !
i understand , you been smokin '?
oh , certainly not , ma'am , i understand your indignation , ma'am ,
and i was offering an explanation , not an excuse ,
i myself am , hey , hey , hey , , don't be explainin 'me , dawg !
you can't read my motherfuckin 'mind , man !
you might got yo 'ph , d , but i got my ged !
yes , nigga !
a fiery lad , but then youth is fiery ,
a fact often remarked upon by the poets of the romantic era ,
my youth , i was in church , i wasn't walkin 'around fiery ,
youth ain't no excuse for nothin ',
anyhow , i just came to show you the fife , othar's fife , burned his own ,
i thought maybe , you bein 'a man of music , you'd be interested ,
oh , indeed i am ,
cut it himself and burned his holes ,
the israelites called it a khalil ,
yeah , you can read all about it in the bible , ain't nothin 'new under the sun ,
indeed not ,
gone these 20 years ,
he was some kind of man ,
blowed the khalil ,
i don't suppose othar ever turned his hand or , or turned his lip to blowing the shofar?
the ceremonial ram's horn sounded by the priests of the hebrews ,
no , i don't know nothin 'about that , othar never blowed no shofar !
of course not , not to the extent of my knowledge ,
the khalil was good enough for my othar ,
he was some kind of man ,
some kind of man ,
oh , goddamn !
come on , girl , let me get one little peek ,
don't be cruel , come on , just one butt cheek ,
pull that ass out and make it clap ,
aw , just 'cause i'm dressed like a janitor , don't mean you gotta do me dirty ,
this muthafucka's hit the jackpot , come on , girl ,
come over here and blow on these dice ,
you know , i'm a seven on the roll now , but i'm a 10 the hard way , and i ain't just talkin 'crap ,
mr , gudge , she had a ass that could pull a bus ,
i mean , gudge , it was more than an ass , it was literature ,
yeah , i don't care how big her ass was , macsam , you're fired ,
you say what?
there is no fraternizing with customers on the bandit queen ,
clean out your locker , but , mr , gudge , i wasn't fraterniz ,
i said get outta here , you're fired ,
you can't fire me !
i'll sue your ass !
sue me?
for what?
for fuckin 'punitive damages , man !
punitive damages , yeah ,
punitive damages , you goddamn skippy !
punitive damages , i see why you firin 'me , mr , gudge ,
yeah , it's simple and plain , you firin 'me 'cause i'm black ,
macsam , everybody on the custodial staff is black ,
your replacement is gonna be black ,
his replacement , no doubt , will be black !
well , the fuckin 'judge is goin 'be black , muthafucka ,
oh , and you?
you gon 'stand tall before the man , oh ,
and your replacement's gonna be black ,
muthafucka !
thank you ,
oh , my ,
oh , my , my , my , my , my , my , my ,
this is a severe setback ,
i am distraught , i'm more than distraught ,
i am devastated ,
i i'm beside myself , i'm at a positive loss for words ,
you still talkin 'ok , though , have you all decided?
madam , we must have waffles , we must all have waffles forthwith ,
we must all think , we must all have waffles and think , each and every one of us , to the very best of his ability ,
perhaps if you apologized to the man and gave him flowers ,
or perhaps a fruit basket with a card depicting a misty seascape and inscribed with a sentiment ,
i ain't apologizin 'to that muthafucka , he fired me 'cause i'm black !
he can't do that , you could sue him , open and shut case ,
fuckin 'a , surely a chocolate assortment has been known to melt the heart of even the hardest misanthrope ,
that man ain't rollin 'over for no fucking candy bar ,
uh , we've had a bit of a setback on the tunneling front , too ,
we've run into a pretty large rock , rock !
very bad , very bad , oh , my ,
seems that the poet was right ,
troubles never singly come ,
oh , no , we can get through the rock , no worries there ,
easiest thing in the world , why , we just blow right through it ,
i got a pyro license , just , uh , bore a hole in the rock and pack in a little plastique , igneous blows pretty good ,
and then we could , hello , garth ,
am i ordering the primer cord?
yes , mountain ,
we were just talking about that , and some plastique ,
what the fuck is this?
oh , this is mountain girl ,
mountain is my right hand , she helps me out with ordnance ,
helps me with , damn near everything , hey ,
you brought yo 'bitch to the waffle hut?
i must confess myself to be puzzled as well ,
i thought it was understood that when it came to our little enterprise ,
mum " was the word ,
of course , i understand that , but this is mountain girl ,
i don't keep secrets from mountain ,
that's not how you maintain a loving , caring relationship ,
you brought yo 'bitch to the waffle hut !
the man brought his bitch , to the waffle hut !
all right , look , you , i will thank you to stop referring to mountain that way ,
she is the other half of my life ,
everybody lookin 'at me like i'm some kind of fuck up for losin 'a sorry ass job , and this muthafucka brings his bitch
to the muthafuckin 'waffle hut !
son of a bitch punk !
shut your goddamn mouth !
you better raise the fuck up , fucka !
gentlemen , please , back the fuck up !
you gon 'back that shit the fuck up !
gentlemen , please , what? !
what? !
please , gentlemen , this behavior does you no credit in the eyes of your colleagues , nor in those of the other patrons of this waffle hut ,
little punk ,
oh , look at this , i got blueberry syrup on my safari jacket !
gentlemen , i propose that we consider the matter of this woman ,
mountain water , mountain girl ,
i'm so very sorry , i propose that we consider this matter closed ,
and we shall choose to trust her since we have no choice , and since she shall share only in mr , pancake 's portion of the booty ,
of course , wouldn't have it any other way ,
yeah , you damn right you won't , up yours , punk ,
oh , fuck you and the swiss miss , the matter of disposing
of our igneous impediment is also , c coach , coach ,
c c coach , i , , closed , settled ,
that leaves us only with the question of gawain retrieving his job ,
coach , i , yes , lump?
couldn't we just bribe the guy?
you are a readin 'fool , aren't you , mr , dorr?
yes , i must confess ,
i often find myself more at home in these ancient volumes than i do in the hustle bustle of the modern world ,
to me , paradoxically , the literature of the so called " dead tongues " holds more currency than this morning's newspaper ,
in these books , in these volumes , there is the accumulated wisdom of mankind , which succors me when the day is hard and the night lonely and long ,
the wisdom of mankind , huh?
what about the wisdom of the lord?
oh ,
yes , yes , the good book , mm , i have found reward in its pages ,
but , to me , there are other good books as well ,
heavy volumes of antiquity freighted with the insights of man's glorious age ,
and then , of course , i just love , love , love the works of mr , edgar allan poe ,
oh , i know who he was , kinda spooky ,
no , madam , no , no ,
not of this world , it's true ,
he , he lived in a dream , an ancient dream ,
helen ,
thy beauty is to me
like those nicean barks of yore ,
that gently , o'er a perfumed sea ,
the weary , wayward wanderer bore
to his own native shore ,
who was helen?
some kinda whore of babylon?
one doesn't know who helen was , but i picture her as being very , very , extremely , pale ,
mrs , munson , i have been trying to figure out some way of expressin 'my gratitude to you for takin 'in this weary , wayward wanderer ,
it's just a little old present , why , it's hardly anything at all ,
oh , why , mr , dorr !
you are a gallant man ,
oh , madam , i blush , i melt , no ,
i just happened to hear of this gospel concert tomorrow night ,
the mighty , mighty clouds of joy " , and i thought you and a friend from church perhaps would ,?
yes , i have a widow lady friend , the concert is up in memphis , so i have arranged a car service to transport you thither ,
ah?
why , sheriff wyner !
how you doin '?
good evenin ', mrs , munson ,
i just stopped by here to let you know i did have a talk with weemack , and he told me he's gonna comply with your request in keepin 'that music down and neighborly ,
so you just go and have yourself a pleasant evenin ',
wait a minute , i got somebody that i want you to meet ,
uh , ma'am , you know what?
i'm , i'm a little pressed for time ,
you got a gang of bank robbers youse chasin '?
come on in here and say hello ,
yeah , we was in here , havin 'tea and ,
huh !
bussed his own dishes , you can always tell a gentleman ,
somebody was in here , ma'am?
yeah , with me and othar ,
well , you know what?
maybe i'll catch him the next time ,
oh , come on up to his room with me and say hello ,
i got a family , my wife got dinner on the table ,
i really have to be goin ',
oh , my , he is neat !
yes , ma'am , he very neat ,
he probably went down to the cellar to play with his friends ,
ma'am , i really got to be goin 'now ,
what ,?
ma'am , i really need to be gettin 'back ,
mrs , munson , don't , you don't have to ,
mrs , munson?
why , professor !

uh , mrs , munson?
oh , lord jesus ,
mrs , munson?
land of goshen , child !
come on out from under there !
mrs , munson , my pager just went off ,
i got to go , i'll meet you and your friend later ,
that was refreshing ,
y'all have a good evenin 'now !
as you know , we academics are inordinately fond of wedgin 'ourselves into confined spaces ,
at yale , the students will see how many of their number they can enclose in a telephone booth , at harvard , a broom closet ,
oh !
hope i didn't spill my tea ,
well , what the hell is this?
i guess it's just my way of sayin ', um ,
oh , well , goddamn it , mr , gudge , look here , i ,
i don't know what it's like walkin 'in your shoes ,
you know , with you bein 'a tight ass and all ,
and i'm pretty sure you don't know what it's like walkin 'in my shoes ,
see , mr , gudge , there's the custodian , right?
and then there's the man inside the custodian ,
and that's the motherfucker we got a problem with ,
see , 'cause that man , he got needs , mr , gudge , and normally those needs gotta do with women with big asses ,
i guess my point bein 'is i realize i'm a bunkie junkie ,
but if you woulda seen the kettle drums on this girl , mr , gudge , whew !
well , we all human ,
this apology buys you a one week probationary period ,
thank you , mr , gudge ,
stay away from the customers , macsam ,
this drill bit's getting awfully hot ,
gawain , maybe you could fill a hudson sprayer and spritz it down while i drill ,
fuck you , i ain't your motherfuckin 'house nigger , i'm the inside man ,
all right , look , are you gonna have a bug up your ass for the rest of the time we work together?
i'll get the sprayer , oh , no , no , no ,
me and this gentleman here have to get square ,
let me tell you somethin ', macsam ,
i'm gonna tell you about how i came down to mississippi ,
i wasn't born here , you know , i'm from scranton , pennsylvania ,
what the fuck?
scranton , pennsylvania , came down here in 1964 , greyhound bus ,
with the freedom riders ,
do you know who the freedom riders were , macsam?
no , and i don't give a fuck ,
just tell me when the fuck they gonna leave , damn !
the freedom riders , my fine young man , were a group of concerned liberals from up north , all working together , just like we are here ,
involved citizens who came down here so that local black folk could have their civil liberties ,
so that people like you could have the vote ,
you know what , man?
what , brother?
i don't vote , so fuck you , you little fuckin 'ingrate ,
and the bus you rode in on , jackass !
let's step outside , macsam !
fuck the outside !
come on !
what? !
my friend mrs , funthes is here , so i'm about to go out ,
just thought i'd leave y'all with some cinnamon cookies ,
why , that is lovely ,
ooh , y'all sound good !
maybe you could come by the church one sunday ,
give us a recital , why , how kind of you !
our music , however , is , uh , well , how shall i put this?
uh , a bit roman in its outlook ,
uh , many of our pieces were commissioned by the holy see ,
oh , i see , all right , but we don't make no big whoop dee do about denomination ,
everybody welcome at our church , yeah , we had a methodist come in ,
episcopalian , back in the '60s , we had a jew come in !
he had a guitar ,  a jew with a guitar ,
if you will excuse me one moment , madam , i shall , uh , i shall see you out ,
if you gentlemen can labor harmoniously in the course of my absence , perhaps upon my return we shall be prepared to explode that vexin 'old piece of igneous ,
oh , professor !
this is mrs , funthes ,
enchant , mrs , funthes , allow me ,
rosalie , this is professor g , h , dorr , ph , d ,
oh , my , that's an awful lot of letters ,
oh , well , no ,
of course , in my youth , i was known simply as goldthwait ,
uh huh ,
all right , safety meeting ,
let's listen up , general , can you hand me the primer cord?
before we set the charge , we will run through our procedure ,
i have earplugs for whoever wants them , just wedge those right in your ears ,
now , here we have , not yet , lump ,
oh , now , primer cord ,
gelatinite , c 4 ,
a and b ,
i remember my father sayin 'to me and it's one of the few memories i retain of the man from one of his visits home , and how i do cherish it he said to me , " goldthwait , you are not formed as other boys ,
he a man of learnin '?
this is the same procedure we will be using when we collapse the tunnel after entering the casino vault and returning to the root cellar ,
he was a self educated man , didn't have a career as such , but the government did recognize the breadth of his readin 'by makin 'him librarian of the state nervous hospital in meridian , where he was a distinguished inmate ,
once these materials are combined only the professionals may handle them ,
that means me or the general ,
separately they are harmless , completely inert ,
why , you could light this stuff on fire , hit it with a ham ,
what in the name of heavens was that?
well , um , i'm quite certain there's absolutely no reason to be alarmed ,
why , i'm not even absolutely certain i heard anything at all ,
didn't hear nothin '? !
well , something perhaps ,
nothing that need discompose us was the sense i was tryin 'to convey ,
now , mrs , munson , i will not have you missin 'your musical recital , off you go !
i shall call the gas company , or the water company ,
whatever subterranean utility is implicated in this contretemps ,
i shall see to the matter , as only a highly educated classicist could ,
blood !
blood , professor , blood !
blood , blood , blood !
it's nothin 'to make a fuss about , it's perfectly all right ,
jackass !
you better get yo 'ass back down there and find that shit , dipshit !
really , i'm perfectly all right , perfectly all right?
jackass , you just blew your goddamn finger off !
the muthafucka down there flappin 'the fuck around !
you better get yo 'ass back down there and find it !
i'm tellin 'you right now , nubbie , i ain't pickin 'up your goddamn finger !
i gather there was a premature detonation ,
would you tell this muthafucka he can sew this shit back on? !
it's like that dude whose wife cut his dick off , threw it on the freeway?
she just called triple a , they towed the dick and sewed the muthafucka back on !
listen up !
jackass , i saw the muthafucka in a porno !
the thang still worked !
it looked like a chewed up frank , but that little muthafucka be workin 'that muthafucka !
it's mangly , but he be fuckin 'the bitch all kind of ways with a twisted dick !
oh !
your fuckin 'finger just moved !
the muthafucka movin 'slow now !
i'm not gettin 'that shit , fuck that !
you're on your own there !
they usin 'the house to practice music , of the rococo ,
i propose we get our fallen comrade to the hospital ,
the general will follow when he manages to recover the severed digit ,
no , no , really , i'm perfectly all right , i don't know what all the fuss is about ,
good news !
good news !
pickles !
go get him !
the house is in apple pie order , though we do have to get medical attention for mr , pancake , who , durin 'the disturbance , pinched his finger in the valve of his sackbut ,
you let the cat out !
wha ,?
the general is even now exercisin 'every effort in retrievin 'your mischievous little pickles , please , go on ,
go on and enjoy the concert !
driver !
au revoir , mesdames ,
despite our setback , we find ourselves on schedule to penetrate the vault here this afternoon , while mrs , munson is at church , havin 'blasted that little old rock to pieces durin 'mrs , munson's choir practice ,
garth , can you run us through the game plan for what remains of our tunnel?
of course , why , it's child's play now , easiest thing in the world ,
only a couple of feet separate us from the vault ,
just the usual spadework until we get to the masonry of the vault , and then we just drill through ,
and will you be able to wield the drill with your maimed extremity?
oh , well , yeah , i should think so , yeah , it's , uh , it's only one finger ,
inhibits me in doing finer work of course , i'll always have to live with that ,
maybe i'm just thinkin 'out loud here maybe , since as you say there will be problems later , maybe and i actually mentioned this to mountain girl , she agrees with me , so it's not just one person's opinion maybe , uh ,
i should get a little extra compensation for the accident ,
somewhat larger share ,
why , if this was any other line of work , i'd be getting workman's comp ,
wouldn't i?
might even have a pretty good lawsuit ,
wait , so you gonna sue yourself for blowing your own goddamn finger off?
well , now that is simply asinine , yes , but you see , garth , this is not what you just called " some other line of work ,
yeah , no , no , no , but if it were ,
this is a criminal enterprise , not to put too fine a point on it , entailing any manner of risk not involved in honest labor ,
governmental regulations and civic safeguards cannot be assumed to apply to antisocial pursuits ,
yeah , but he lost his finger , we don't give a fuck !
that fool could blow his goddamn dick off , it don't make no nevermind to us !
we not payin 'this jackass for goin 'around blowin 'off goddamn body parts !
get yo 'fuckin 'head out yo 'ass , man !
look you , there is no call for ,
no extra share !
ok , majority rules ,
like i say , it was just a trial balloon , hand's not so bad really ,
i even get some phantom feeling ,
yeah , you pull on your prick , you get some phantom feelin ',
fuck you , fuck you ,
fuck you !
fuck you , nubbie !
well , now that that matter is settled , why don't we synchronize our watches before gawain reports to work ,
in 20 seconds , it will be exactly 12 : 16 ,
fifteen , what , it'll be 12 : 15?
no , 15 seconds , well , 11 seconds now , it il be 12 : 16 ,
eight , seven , professor?
prof ,? , six , professor? , five , yes , lump !
i don't have a watch ,
there'll be no more weepin 'and wailin '
no more weepin 'and wailin '
no more weepin 'and wailin '
home to live with god oh ,
soon i will be done with the troubles of this world
troubles of this world troubles of this world
oh , soon i will be done with the troubles of this world

yeah , soon i will be done with the troubles of this world

whoo hoo hoo !
ain't that somethin '!
i , b , s , you be what?
irritable bowel syndrome !
is there a men's room down here?
oh , come on , you shouldn't be usin 'the men's room now !
or a lady's room , quickly , i , b , s ,
if you knew you had the runs , why didn't you shit back at the house?
quickly !
we don't want elron finding your stinkin 'ass on the crapper !
no choice , it's a medical condition , quickly !
you one disgustin 'individual , you know that?
come on , follow me ,
i feel 30 pounds lighter ,
come the fuck on with your stinkass , thank you for being so understanding ,
not everyone is , of course , which is why the biggest challenge of i , b , s , is educating the public ,
afflicts over two million people , yet most of us have never heard of it ,
and it strikes without regard to age , gender or race ,
oh , fuck , man , i don't wanna hear about this shit ,
well , that's exactly the kind of attitude we're fighting ,
i guess i never told you that's how mountain girl and i met ,
they had an i , b , s , weekend at grossinger's up in the catskills ,
of course , the tourist business there has suffered with the demise of the borscht belt , so they have various promotions , mixers , so on ,
this was a weekend for irritable bowel singles to meet and support each other
and share stories , man , look here ,
i don't want to hear a single one of them stories , ok?
now , some of them are very moving , not one fucking story !
look , i didn't choose to have i , b , s , man , shut the fuck up !
there's no cure , you know , only control , lifelong condition ,
yeah , you know what?
bein 'an asshole's a lifelong condition , too ,
just drop the fuckin 'tools ,
i'm not complaining , i did meet mountain girl ,
man , get back in the fuckin 'hole !
oh !
marvel , marvelous , marv , this way !
this way , gentlemen !
oh !
excellent !
excellent , flawless , flawless , thumbs up ,
can't stop shittin ', can't stop talkin 'about shittin ',
gentlemen , to we few , we who have shared each other's company , each other's cares , each other's joys , and who shall now reap the fruits of our communal efforts , shoulder to shoulder , from each according to his abilities , so forth and whatnot ,
we have had our little differences along the way , but i'd like to think that they've only made us value one another all the more ,
each of us coming to understand and appreciate the other's unique qualities and potencies and , yes , foibles ,
i suggest that we shall look back upon this little caper one day , one distant day , grandchildren dandled upon our knee , and perhaps a tear will form and we shall say ,
well , with wit and grit and no small amount of courage , we accomplished something on that day , a feat of derring do , an enterprise not ignoble ,
we merry band , unbound by the constraints of society and the prejudices of the common ruck ,
we happy few ,
gentlemen , to us !
to us !
charge shoulda gone off already ,
i do beg your pardon?
the charge to collapse the tunnel , i set it for eight minutes ,
well , that much time and more has certainly elapsed ,
i need not remind you , it is of the essence of this plan that the money should appear to have simply vanished without a trace ,
spirited away , as it were , by ghosts , of course ,
the conundrum of the undisturbed , yet empty vault , the unsolvable riddle of the sealed yet violated sanctum , is of the utmost importance , not only to make our caper more intellectually satisfying , it is exigent as a matter of practical fact ,
i remind you that if any tunnel is ever found leading to this house , the owner knows all your names ,
you just fart?
nope , nope , i'm fine , perfectly all right !
not a problem !
there's no hole left ,
professor !
i'm surprised !
well , uh , properly speaking , madam , we are surprised , you are taken aback ,
though i do acknowledge that the sense that you intend is gaining increasing currency through its use , yes ,
you have returned from your devotions betimes ,
i had to make tea ,
i want to talk to you , professor , so don't you be leavin '!
and you !
i told you i don't want any smokin 'in this house !
oh , come on in !
how you doin '?
tea , ladies ,
now , i don't know what you boys been up to , but i know mischief when i see it , now , i want an explanation , but first ,
i want you to get your fannies up here with all y'all's period instruments ,
now , i been tellin 'the ladies about your music , and they want to hear you play ,
professor?
yes , lump?
i can't really play the buttsack ,
madam , or rather , mesdames , you must accept our apologies for not bein 'able to perform , for , as you see , we are shorthanded ,
gawain is still at work , and we could no more play with one part tacit than a horse could canter shy one leg ,
perhaps i could offer , as a poor but ready substitute , a brief poetic recital ,
though i do not pretend to any great oratorical skills ,
i would be happy to present , with your ladies 'permission , verse from the unquiet mind of mr , edgar allan poe ,
ladies , thy beauty is to me
like those nicean barks of yore ,
that gently , o'er a perfumed sea , the weary , wayward wanderer bore
to his own native shore ,
my , my , my ,
on desperate seas long wont to roam ,
thy hyacinth hair , thy classic face ,
thy naiad airs have brought me home
to the glory that was greece and the grandeur that was rome , " glory hallelujah , amen !
hm?
bye bye , ladies , it was , it was my pleasure ,
we have to do this again ,  yes , we do got to ,
such a pleasure , safe home , safe home ,
now i want to know what's goin 'on , oh , indeed , indeed ,
the thirst for knowledge is a very commendable thing ,
though i do believe that when you hear the explanation you shall laugh riotously , slappin 'your knee and perhaps even wipin 'away a giddy tear , relieved of your former concern ,
lump here is an avid collector of indian arrowheads , and having found one simply lying on your cellar floor
a particularly rare artifact of the natchez tribe?
nats , what?
he enlisted the entire ensemble in an all out effort to sift through the subsoil in search of others ,
and apparently , in doing so , we hit a mother lode of natural gas ,
i myself became acutely aware of the smell of " rotten eggs ,
and it was just at this inopportune moment that the general here violated the cardinal rule of this house
and lit himself a cigarette , so sorry ,
well , what about all that money?
ah ,
the money , well , the money is mr , pancake's ,
that's right , who only just remortgaged his home in order to raise the money for a surgical procedure that will correct the wandering eye of his common law wife , mountain water , who suffers from astigmia , strabismus and a general curdling of the vitreous jelly ,
mr , pancake is an ardent foe of the federal reserve , and is , in fact , one of those eccentrics one often reads about hoardin 'his entire life savings , in mr , pancake 's case , in a hefty bag that is his constant companion ,
the steel sak , don't trust the banks , never have ,
it don't smell right to me ,
i'm callin 'sheriff wyner , no !
madam !
please , please , madam !
no , no , i beg of , yes !
yes !
it is a lie !
it is a fantastic tale !
you have us dead to rights , but , madam , please , please , please allow me to tell you the truth in private ,
madam ,
madam , we are not musicians of the late renaissance ,
nor of the early , nor mid period ,
we are , in fact , criminals ,
desperate men , mrs , munson ,
we have tunneled into the nearby offices of the bandit queen gambling emporium
and relieved it of its treasure , lord have mercy ,
it is true ,
the bandit queen is a den of iniquity , a painted harlot luring people into sin by exciting the vice of greed with her promise of easy winnings , oh , yes ,
her gains are ill gotten ,
but , i offer no excuses save one ,
we men have each pledged one half of our share of the booty to a charitable institution ,
in compensation for the use of your home , we had planned to donate a full share to bob jones university , without burdening you with guilty knowledge by informing you of same ,
but now you have wrested the information from me ,
there you have it , it is on your table , mrs , munson ,
the " awful truth ,
stolen money , but find the victim , mrs , munson ,
i challenge you , even the casino itself , that riparian gomorrah , shall suffer no harm ,
it has an insurance company ,
a financial behemoth that will cheerfully replenish its depleted vaults ,
that is its function ,
and that insurance company has tens and tens of thousands of policyholders ,
so that , we have done the calculations , mrs , munson ,
so that at the end of the day , at the final reckoning , each and every one of those policyholders shall have contributed one penny ,
one , single , solitary cent to the satisfaction of this claim ,
one penny?
one penny , think of it , mrs , munson ,
one penny from those thousands upon thousands of people so that bob jones university can continue on its mission ,
why , i have no doubt that , were those policy holders made aware of the existence of that august institution , each and every one of them would have volunteered some token amount for the furtherance of its aims ,
well , that's prob'ly true ,
sadly , the criminal stain is upon my soul , but the benefit shall accrue to any number of worthy causes as long , that is , as the secret stays with us ,
well ,
i can't hardly see the harm in it ,
one penny?
one penny ,
i'm sorry , excuse me?
no , i'm sorry , it's wrong , and don't you be leadin 'me into temptation ,
no , no , madam , i must strenuously , i'm sorry , it's just plain wrong ,
stealin '!
no , madam ,
i know your intentions was good , no , they weren't !
and i won't call the police if you give back the money and y'all go to church with me next sunday ,
and engage in divine worship? !
i've made up my mind ,
now , you can doubletalk all you want , it's church or the county jail ,
think it over , i gotta feed the cat ,
motherfuck !
yes ,
unfortunately , mrs , munson has rather complicated the situation ,
yeah , well , i know how to decomplicate it ,
you bust a cap in that old bitch's head , everything be simple ,
not easy to do , many reasons ,
quiet neighborhood , sleepy town ,
a harmless woman , a deed conceived and executed in cold blood ,
oh , no , gawain , would that it were simple ,
well , fuck , man !
what we gonna do?
give the money back and go to church?
i shudder , i quake ,
you , sir , are a buddhist ,
is there not a " middle " way?
must float like a leaf on the river of life , , and kill old lady ,
yes , yes , i suppose you are right ,
it is the active nature of the crime , though , that so abhors ,
the squeezing of the trigger , the plunging of the knife ,
but , let us think a moment ,
what other tools do we have at hand?
we have the cellar ,
we have the cavity ,
we have masonry and trowel ,
perhaps we could simply , immure her ,
sure , easiest thing in the world , i can whip up a little mortar in a snow saucer ,
lay the bricks , anchor in some chains ,
mountain girl could outsource the manacles ,
ah , gentlemen , gentlemen , we delude ourselves ,
no , shortest and painless is best ,
gawain's gun , retort muffled by a pillow , into the brain , the affair of an instant ,
the only question is who wields the weapon?
i believe it is traditional in such circumstances to draw straws ,
fair enough , here you go , lump ,
i'm thinkin ', though , that since i lost a finger
and i mean literally lost it 'cause of that fuckin 'cat maybe i should be excused from this thing ,
hard for me to squeeze a trigger anyway ,
you one whiny muthafucka ,
i'll come over there and squeeze your fuckin 'nutsack , you keep that bullshit up ,
shut up , punk !
i'll kick your goddamn ass , sweet legs !
gentlemen !
no special pleading , no exceptions ,
it is of the nature of the situation we would all prefer to be excused ,
well , ok , it was just a trial balloon ,
long straw , you all see it , all that fuss for nothin ', punk ,
fuck you ,
motherfuck !
lord , i'm troubled
lord , i'm troubled
lord , i'm troubled oh , lord , by my soul
my lord , but when i get up in the kingdom , lord
i won t be troubled no more
oh , lord , i'm troubled lord , i'm troubled
lord , i'm troubled
oh , would you like a hot cross bun?
no , just an explanation .
coming up !
ouisie , i'll take some cocoa .
hi , george .

i love you , mama , i'm sorry , mama , i love you ,
yeah , i'll wipe the dog's ass and everything , mama ,
i'll train him to shit in the toilet , mama ,
i'll wipe his ass and everything , mama , what you doin '?
what you doin 'with my pillow?

ugh !
i'm displeased with you !
yeah , but , fine colored boy like you

ugh !
now , i know your mama taught you better than that !
i can't do it , she remind me of my mama ,
look , man , why , this is most irregular , , y'all muthafuckas just gonna have to draw straws again ,
wait a minute , you've got to accept your responsibilities , young man , and shoot that old lady ,
hey , man , fuck you and your irritated bowel !
must shoot ,
now , look here , it's the easiest thing in the world ,
just pretend her head's a casaba melon and the gun is a melon baller ,
what the fuck are you talkin 'about?
a melon baller?
look , man , you do it , oh , this is most irregular ,
now , look , with equal rights comes equal responsibility ,
i'm afraid mr , pancake is correct , we cannot draw straws again ,
the exercise would lose all credibility if you show the loser can simply beg off ,
must shoot ,
hey , look , man , she's just an old colored lady to you ,
come on , man , you do it ,
why , you sniveling little coward , what did you say to me?
sniveling little coward , you whiny muthafucka ,
i will come up yo 'stankin ', irritated asshole with this gun and give you a lead colonic , muthafucka !
you think you scare me , you mewling punk?
you don't scare me , bull connor and all his dogs didn't scare me !
now , be a man ,
you fuck !
you ain't no fuckin 'man !
oh , my , this is most distressin ', be a man !
you ain't no fuckin 'man !
fuckin 'a 60 year old with pigtails !

mountain girl is 53 !

oh , yeah? !
gentlemen , please !

oh , my god ,
oh , no ,
oh , my ,
i think he's hit ,  oh , no ,
i'll just check the carotid artery ,
that's a negative , is he dead , professor?
oh , sure he's dead , lump , i just checked his carotid artery , well , this is most irregular ,
we shall need a hefty bag ,
she is in the kitchen ,
you steal out with the carcass while i dazzle her with conversation ,
my dear mrs , munson , i have outlined your position with my colleagues , and i now return to you to render our collective verdict ,
there was much spirited discussion and an atmosphere of frank give and take ,
some of our number were initially appalled at your proposal that we simply return the money , some were more receptive ,
i don't care if they was receptive or not !
and that attitude , madam , was a factor in our discussions ,
to a man , i must say they were devastated at the prospect of not being able to contribute to their respective charities ,
well , that is a shame , indeed , but at the end of the day , your position prevailed ,
so we have decided to return the money , every last cent of it , and attend sunday services , rather than spend the remainder of our days wastin 'away at the mississippi men's correctional facility ,
though that was the original preference of some ,
you are not assistin 'with the cadaver ,
oh , no need ,
just chuck it off the bridge , easiest thing in the world ,
i'm just cleanin 'up here ,
oh !
that's them , back already ,
i'll just go dump these in the hearse ,
yeah , easiest thing in the world ,
general !
no extra share , huh?
mountain?
garth?
i , b , s , dear?
oh , come
let us go back
to god
go back to god oh , come on
let's go back to god let us go back
let's go back to god come on
let's go back to god
get garth ,
let us go back
to god
go back to god
excellent , i believe , at last , we have the right man for the job ,
they crucified the savior
they crucified the savior
they crucified the savior
and nailed him to the cross
the old woman is a more formidable antagonist than one had imagined ,
now , lump , it falls to you to finish the job ,
the comedy must end , you know ,
i've been doin 'some thinkin ', professor , oh , dear ,
maybe we should be goin 'to church , maybe she is right ,
ooh , dear , lump , i feared those would be your words ,
not that i don't appreciate you giving the matter the benefit of your thought , but recall , my dear boy , our respective functions in this enterprise ,
i am a professor , the professor , as you yourself so often say , the thinker ,
trained , in fact , in the arts of cogitation ,
you , lump , are the goon , the hooligan , the dumb brute , whose actions must be directed by a higher intelligence ,
yeah , i know , but ,
ah , ah , ah !
no buts , dear boy , do not repeat the error of thinkin ',
now is the moment of praxis , now , lump , you must act ,
well , i can't do it , professor , a nice old lady like that ,
think of the riches , lump , that you and i alone shall divide ,
yeah , i know , but ,
and reflect also that if you decline to act , thus forcin 'me to do so , you shall no longer have any entitlement to the money ,
your offices shall have been nugatory ,
you mean you're gonna kill her?
of course , yes , my hand shall be forced ,
i can't allow you to do that , professor ,
you , allow?
not allow?
what presumption !
you stupid boy !
you very , very , extremely stupid boy ,
oh , yeah?
who looks stupid now?
no bullets?
perhaps it had to be thus ,
lo !
in yon brilliant window niche
how statue like i see thee stand ,
a raven ,
the agate lamp within thy hand !
ah , psyche , from the regions which
are holy land !
professor?
couldn't face the music ,
i appreciate that , but we don't know what to do , tried that , too ,
oh ,
uh , mrs , munson , gotta make a statement , sheriff ,
ma'am , could it possibly wait?
we're kinda busy down here today ,
oh , well , i suppose it could wait , but it's about that casino money ,
let me call you back , you know somethin 'about it?
somethin '?
everything !
i got it at home ,
you got what at home?
the money ! $1, 6 million dollars ,
it's down in my root cellar , how did it get there , marva?
well , a bunch of desperate men stole it and put it there , that's how !
see , they was musicians of the renaissance period , turned out they really couldn't play , but they could recite poems that'd break your heart ,
the ringleader spoke in dead tongues , does he now?
oh , i tried to get you to see him ,
that night , yes , ma'am ,
i had to holler at 'em about stealin 'all that money ,
and i guess i made 'em feel real bad ,
'cause they just picked up and left without takin 'the money !
and they let pickles out !
so you want us to come over and fetch him ,
oh , no , no , he's back ,
what you want me to do with the money?
you keep it !
why don't you keep it?
keep it?
go on and keep it , miss marva ,
well ,
it is just a penny off of everybody's policy ,
could ,?
you don't suppose i could ,?
yes , ma'am?
could i just give it all to bob jones university?
yeah , that'd be nice ,
give it all to 'em !
that's a good idea !
as long as everybody knows ,
how you doin '?
pickles !
oh , lord , pickles !
