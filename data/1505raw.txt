marcelino rivelli .
1 7 fights in spain .
an ltalian ...
ex airline pilot ...
left ltaly in 1 923 .
after the death of de bossis ; left switzerland to throw tracts over milan .
after a year in hiding ;
deported to the lipari lslands .
escaped to spain ; three days after franco's uprising ; and served as a pilot .
wounded on the madrid front .
political commissary of his squadron .
died today on the teruel front .
to those who have just joined the squadron ; i have this to say : we loved this man .
what's that?
the village slate .
they bury our boys in their cemetery and put up this sign .
they all go to the funeral .
an hour after death ; the soul can be seen .
must be an hour by now ...
are the new planes here?
we were outnumbered eight to one .
are our boys still advancing?
the ximenes brigade is waiting for the bridge to be blown up .
lf only we had those new gun sights ...
escaton ; pinares ; navas and other villages rose up last night .
how far up?
up to linas .
franco's reinforcements can only come through saragossa .
our men will attack after the bridge has been blown up .
but how can we if we're outnumbered eight to one?
we're glad to see you back .
hello .
time this thing was replaced !
yes ; hq .
yes ; sir .
you can't go ; munoz .
too bad we hadn't already gone !
we haven't enough planes to let them shoot us down as they please .
it's impossible !
it all depends on the bridge ; now .
there are plenty of comrades beyond the bridge .
even in town?
especially in town .
ours?
yes .
they must be near the river .
they're already there .
the bridge at all costs " .
everything depends on linas .
we regained control of the village last night .
let's hope we keep it !
we're ok if just the police are watching the bridge .
otherwise ...
ls the bridge mined?
yes ; but if franco's men make it to linas ...
their army will defend the bridge and we'll be in trouble .
there aren't enough of us .
we need trusty comrades .
what do you mean by " trusty "?
reliable .
got many weapons?
one automatic rifle .
some dynamite .
more out of town .
and in linas?
one moment ...
gonzalez !
how many weapons do we have in linas?
two combat rifles .
some hunting rifles ...
not much .
a little dynamite .
i taught them how to use it ; but they're inexperienced .
take them the dynamite you have .
ls there another way than through the old gate?
we'd be under enemy fire for 400 meters .
just this?
not even 20 bullets per person .
we'll have more .
first ; we go through the old gate .
lmpossible to get out any other way .
what about the guards?
eliminate them .
once outside ; get to the garage .
there are at least 2 cars .
then ; juan's friends and i will take care of the bridge .
gonzalez and all the others ...
will take the dynamite to linas and do what they can . having spotted franco's airfield , comes looking for a guide
who'll take him through the enemy lines .
popular front commlttee
you're too stubborn !
explain .
mum's the word " .
well then?
what do we do with the wounded?
take them to my school .
jos 's right .
we've done enough talking .
for 9 days he watched franco's airfield being built .
they plan on using the road ; too .
he saw the planes arrive ...
you saw them?
me ; and the others .
of course !
that's not the problem .
we heard the republican soldiers were here ... and there's only you .
i've got to cross the lines
and join the army .
it's not that easy .
tell us where the planes are .
we could send some men with you .
at this rate ; we'll be busier here ...
one field looks like any other ...
don't be so sure ...
you have to recognize it and point it out ... to the pilots .
i should've left already .
the flock is fleeing franco's machine guns .
a dozen loyal comrades will leave with you .
one of you will make it through .
you go and get them .
we'll all go .
take five .
the others will follow on .
one of us has to make it .
i'll go alone with him .
got any bikes?
just two .
use them while you can .
the others can walk .
round up the comrades .
revolver?
no thanks .
that's all i need .
you have to hold the pass at any price .
our men are weary .
men from the town are coming with guns .
to the gate !
you two stay with the wounded .
the rest ; to the gate !
a cannon !
who knows about cannons?
varga ; didn't you serve in morocco?
i don't know how to use them .
how fast can the 75 mm . fire?
1 5 shots per minute .
ln theory ...
every 4 seconds .
suppose we go the other way?
we must go this way .
the other way's blocked !
we need a car .
i saw one in mostoles street .
you can drive ; come with me .
you lot go round ...
wait over there and when we're at the cannon ;
make your move !
can you do it?
yes .
lf you crash into something sideways ; you don't necessarily die .
and you miss the cannon .
you don't necessarily die head on either .
the republicans find a car outside the town .
they arrive at linas to help the peasants who are fighting to keep franco's men off the bridge .
how many rifles?
200 kilos of dynamite ; and our men have reached the river .
how many rifles?
200 kilos of dynamite ; i said !
what use is that?
we've nothing to load it in .
we had nothing in asturias ; but we managed .
you've no rifles !
us and anyone who has no family will hold the pass as long as we can with our hunting rifles .
that's all we can do .
we need more men for the wounded !
the stretcher bearers are tired out .
there are no paths on either side .
we'll have to go on foot .
on the right ; the mountain ... on the left ; the ravine .
does the route go along the hillside?
climbing hard?
will franco's men cross there?
they can't do otherwise .
we ain't doomed yet !
nor are the men at the bridge .
other than you ; who do the men respect the most?
the school master .
you go with varga .
the rest of you ; search the houses and bring anything we can use to put the dynamite in .
ls there any clay?
more than rifles .
varga ; don't forget the cooking pots .
with some clay on ; they'll do .
bring back some clay .
fermin will .
two men are to go with the teacher .
the women can carry the things .
the rest of us will load up .
we've got the fuses and primers .
quiet ; everybody !
it rolls .
not straight ; it doesn't .
that's not strong enough .
ok .
are there any more?
four more .
get them ; and tell everyone to bring what they can .
this is strong .
it's not strong enough .
we need iron .
we can use these .
want bottles?
we used bottles in asturias .
no ; we've got something better than that .
we'll add fuses and make grenades .
that's great !
fantastic !
where do we put the fuses?
there's a hole already .
does it roll?
lf we put wheels on !
find a wheelbarrow .
what do you want to do with these?
when it explodes ; it's dangerous .
let's hope they get through to the pilots ...
armed with these odd containers ... the peasants fought franco's men and kept them from reaching the bridge , their only means of communication with the rear .
captain ; weren't you with richthofen's squadron?
22 allied planes .
that's official .
we need real technicians .
when was the last time you flew?
1 91 8 .
how long do you need to be able to fly again?
a couple of hours ; i reckon .
have you been working in aviation?
lately ; i've been working in the mines .
to think ; maybe some of them fought against him at verdun .
he could damn well land on the shooting range !
which was your party?
none .
always independent !
what about you ; munoz?
socialist?
above all ; i was a pacifist .
ls that why you fly so low?
you've got used to the danger?
perhaps .
ln the socialist party ; we knew full well the moors were helping franco .
and we wondered ... what the arab workers thought .
i came over as soon as i could .
i came because i was bored .
the targets are ready .
it's flying at least .
it's landing .
civilian planes aren't used in wartime ; so we may as well ...
he's wide .
he'll do it again !
i'm sorry .
i told you i'd need a couple of hours 'practice .
i've spent too long in the mines .
my sight's not as good as it was .
we'll see ...
no need .
i refuse to fly again .
get me into the militia .
please ...
someone who shoots like that is good enough for the militia .
it's a static target .
allow me .
this i can still do .
they arrive at the last village held by franco's men .
they must find out how to cross the lines and reach the republicans 'airfield .
we're going into that caf .
where are you going? " ...
i'm sure the lines aren't far .
we've done nothing .
we took the wrong road .
they won't believe us .
they'll nab us .
what about the planes during this time?
8 days ago ; that caf was ours .
it's open .
we've just gone past it .
how will he know us?
coffee with brandy .
no sugar .
it'll come soon .
two cups of coffee .
no sugar .
ln that case ... coffee with brandy .
okay .
it'll come soon .
okay .
we want a word with you .
armed?
a little .
the garden's out back .
leave that cat alone !
where can the lines be crossed?
the street you came from ...
who sends you?
pablo ; in linas .
at the end of the street ; you turn and ...
thanks for coming .
don't mention it .
it's not for you or for me .
where are the planes?
ln the woods .
down tracks like these .
but further in .
it's a big wood .
what's the airfield like?
where they take off ; you mean?
it's not like this one .
narrower?
the soldiers are working on it non stop .
they're making it bigger .
what orientation?
ln the direction of the east wind .
so the woods are to the west of the field .
are you sure?
1 00 % sure .
remember the direction the wind came from yesterday?
north .
it felt like rain .
it's the same here .
they'll have trouble taking off .
how many planes?
i counted six small ones .
others claim to have seen more .
at least six big ones .
maybe there's more .
where did you see them?
i couldn't tell you .
take me in your machine and i'll show you .
just like that !
have you ever flown before?
won't you be scared?
will you recognize the airfield?
i've lived in the village 28 years .
lf you show me the saragossa road ...
i can show you the airfield .
go and get some rest .
you'll need it .
phone the air office ; the war office ... whatever it takes .
ask for cars for the night take off .
we don't have a single headlight .
i hope they do !
shut up !
what about the peasant?
he knows where franco's secret airfield is .
so ... tonight?
you are appointed political commissary .
i'll announce it at tomorrow's meeting .
do you know who i am?
my father is one of the fascist leaders ...
... in my country .
i know that .
i accept .
you take the second plane .
we can have a try at night .
does the peasant really know where the airfield is?
maybe .
ln this part of the world ; there's no room for error .
the airfield is here .
we're here .
that's why they blocked the bridge !
they can't keep watch at night .
we have to start with the airfield .
at dawn .
lf we destroy it ; they'll only be able to warn their bases to the south .
we'll be on the bridge before then .
after ...
captain !
what?
there's not a car anywhere !
the war office have had 7 requests already .
but for different reasons .
it's crucial .
a surprise bombing of an enemy airfield is stupid if it's not done at night .
and if they attack ...
let's hope for clouds !
as for the cars ; we'll have to ask the villagers .
are the two crews ready?
only two?
come and see ; political commissary !
that's the one they're repairing?
what about the reserve?
we've been expecting the engines for 6 months .
so tonight ; zero fighter planes?
no ; they won't be back from madrid .
the main thing is to find some headlights .
let's go get the cars .
the one we shot down yesterday .
they've improved them .
look at their machine gun .
but we still have a chance !
hurry up !
to take off at night , the two men ask the peasants to lend them cars , so they can light up the airfield with their headlights .
i'm in charge of the airfield .
i need some cars .
we're leaving tonight and i've no lights .
we need car headlights .
and i don't have any cars .
nor does the war office .
you do have cars .
3 cars and 2 trucks .
you need 1 2 cars !
it's a matter of life and death for our comrades up there .
we can't loan you the cars without our men .
they've already worked 1 5 hours today .
our mechanics will drive .
the drivers can sleep in the cars .
when do you want them?
3 o'clock at the latest .
these cars and a few fires should do the trick .
we'd crash into the orange trees !
we'll do what we can .
three at least ; i promise .
and more if possible .
we still have to ensure supplies get through .
see if you can sort it out with the other villages .
aviation .
i understand your needs ; but a promise is a promise ; and i can't .
we'll do the best we can ; like the others .
3 cars !
you're the last people we can ask .
we'll do our best .
let's go ; sleepyhead !
how many cars?
five .
let's hope there'll be more .
who are they?
volunteers .
what for?
to carry the supplies .
where are the trucks?
they're at the airfield to help you out .
and he just puffs away in peace !
you're back ; captain .
how many cars?
they're coming .
i told them where to put them .
when the whistle blows ; they'll turn on their lights .
we'll all crash into the orange trees ...
twelve?
very good .
we'll come out at 5 o'clock .
tell your comrades not to be scared .
we won't crash into them .
ls there no other landmark than teruel?
after that ; follow the saragossa road up to the peasant's village .
beyond silos .
i hope he recognizes it .
we'll go straight to the bridge .
it'll be daylight .
too late for them .
we're 400 meters off course .
presently ; we'll be going through clouds .
land !
ours?
no ... theirs .
we must be over teruel .
there'll be gaps in the clouds .
make a turn now .
ls that teruel?
that's teruel?
does he recognize it?
there's the saragossa road !
go up again !
bearing 27 4 .
their field must be 20 kms . from here .
5 minutes .
lf we don't find it right away ... we'll get caught by their fighters .
the clouds are hiding us .
looks like teruel hasn't spotted us yet .
they haven't fired .
what's he up to?
doesn't he recognize it?
lf he doesn't spot it ; what then?
must be around here .
dive !
there are mountains !
not that way .
go on .
the clouds are getting lower .
i'm going down to 200 meters .
lf there are any mountains ; we'll be in trouble .
do i turn?
no time .
follow the road !
ls that your village?
there's the saragossa road .
where's the landing field?
lower !
there it is !
the fighters are coming !
open fire on the bunker !
ready?
ready !
climb !
our bombs might damage us as they explode .
altimeter 300?
300 .
take aim .
their fighters aren't far now .
and us ; with our 1 91 3 machine guns !
it's migration time .
boys ; the captain's coming back !
how about that for a nice piece of work !
all thanks to our mascot !
hey ; catch this !
too far for the vertical ; pujol .
turn ; for chrissakes !
dive !
don't worry ; others will be coming .
they're back !
put a tourniquet on .
rear turret ; they're coming back !
they're flying away !
our fighters are coming .
we're falling ...
only one engine left .
suppose we glide?
pujol ... are you wounded?
climb !
the mountain !
pull up !
shut your face !
the first plane is back at base .
the captain , informed by telephone that a plane has crashed in the hills ; goes to rescue his men .
they're not there .
the comrade says they crashed higher up .
ln the mountains .
higher up ; there's only valdelinares .
shall i call?
bullets?
the man who was here before was one of us .
on july 1 8th ; he phoned madrid and ...
first of all ; they spoke of mora hospital .
no one at the town hospital .
no one at the school hospital .
then ; linares .
no one there either .
now ; higher up ; in the mountains ...
they called mora to ask for a doctor for the wounded pilots ; so maybe ...
he ; too ; wants to be a pilot !
it's one of the pilots .
it's you ; pujol?
who's dead?
wounded?
who's able to walk?
yes .
on mules .
are they taking care of you?
they're doing their best .
let me talk to the doctor .
can you make up some stretchers?
i'll bring some .
start going down .
i'll wait for the ambulance .
it'll go as high up as it can .
take down the dead too .
aren't the pilots with you?
no ; they're going down the ravine .
phone them and tell them .
i must stay here .
lf i could go ; i would .
what use would you be?
i'm going !
me too .
to carry stretchers?
you can hardly stand !
i'll do what i can .
you'll have to help .
what can you do for the dead?
be grateful to him .
can you see?
a little .
i can see you .
want anything?
i want her to go to hell with her broth !
where's the ambulance?
it'll take us a good hour to get down .
got a mirror?
the one with the face wound mustn't drink .
but i used our last chicken ...
never mind .
my son's at the front ; too .
we're from val de san garcia .
what can we do?
talk to the doctor .
you mustn't let him drink ; even if he asks you to .
so you shot down their plane?
i'll never have a chance to do it again .
of course you will .
the ambulance is here .
you and i know that's not true .
with a bullet in the stomach ; i've got 3 hours .
look at the time .
give me my flying suit .
ask the doctor for his flying suit .
it's all the same to me ...
i could've fallen ill and died in the mines .
you know ... during the fight ; they all held up their mascots ; like kids .
i looked at them .
tell them i never had contempt for them .
please ...
the way i looked at them embarrassed them .
it's not that i despised them ... but that i understood i was old .
the suits are at the town hall .
what do you want?
maybe i can get it for you .
a revolver .
i've had my time .
i don't need any longer .
not till you've seen the doctor .
not till i've seen the doctor ...
where are they from?
one's german ; the other's french ...
and that one?
spanish .
and that one?
an arab .

captain ; weren't you with richthofen's squadron?
22 allied planes .
that's official .
we need real technicians .
when was the last time you flew?
1 91 8 .
how long do you need to be able to fly again?
a couple of hours ; i reckon .
have you been working in aviation?
lately ; i've been working in the mines .
to think ; maybe some of them fought against him at verdun .
he could damn well land on the shooting range !
which was your party?
none .
always independent !
what about you ; munoz?
socialist?
above all ; i was a pacifist .
ls that why you fly so low?
you've got used to the danger?
perhaps .
ln the socialist party ; we knew full well the moors were helping franco .
and we wondered ... what the arab workers thought .
i came over as soon as i could .
i came because i was bored .
the targets are ready .
it's flying at least .
it's landing .
civilian planes aren't used in wartime ; so we may as well ...
he's wide .
he'll do it again !
i'm sorry .
i told you i'd need a couple of hours 'practice .
i've spent too long in the mines .
my sight's not as good as it was .
we'll see ...
no need .
i refuse to fly again .
get me into the militia .
please ...
someone who shoots like that is good enough for the militia .
it's a static target .
allow me .
this i can still do .
they arrive at the last village held by franco's men .
they must find out
how to cross the lines and reach the republicans 'airfield .
we're going into that caf .
where are you going? " ...
i'm sure the lines aren't far .
we've done nothing .
we took the wrong road .
they won't believe us .
they'll nab us .
what about the planes during this time?
8 days ago ; that caf was ours .
it's open .
we've just gone past it .
how will he know us?
coffee with brandy .
no sugar .
it'll come soon .
two cups of coffee .
no sugar .
ln that case ... coffee with brandy .
okay .
it'll come soon .
okay .
we want a word with you .
armed?
a little .
the garden's out back .
leave that cat alone !
where can the lines be crossed?
the street you came from ...
who sends you?
pablo ; in linas .
at the end of the street ; you turn and ...
thanks for coming .
don't mention it .
it's not for you or for me .
where are the planes?
ln the woods .
down tracks like these .
but further in .
it's a big wood .
what's the airfield like?
where they take off ; you mean?
it's not like this one .
narrower?
the soldiers are working on it non stop .
they're making it bigger .
what orientation?
ln the direction of the east wind .
so the woods are to the west of the field .
are you sure?
1 00 % sure .
remember the direction the wind came from yesterday?
north .
it felt like rain .
it's the same here .
they'll have trouble taking off .
how many planes?
i counted six small ones .
others claim to have seen more .
at least six big ones .
maybe there's more .
where did you see them?
i couldn't tell you .
take me in your machine and i'll show you .
just like that !
have you ever flown before?
won't you be scared?
will you recognize the airfield?
i've lived in the village 28 years .
lf you show me the saragossa road ...
i can show you the airfield .
go and get some rest .
you'll need it .
phone the air office ; the war office ... whatever it takes .
ask for cars for the night take off .
we don't have a single headlight .
i hope they do !
shut up !
what about the peasant?
he knows where franco's secret airfield is .
so ... tonight?
you are appointed political commissary .
i'll announce it at tomorrow's meeting .
do you know who i am?
my father is one of the fascist leaders ...
... in my country .
i know that .
i accept .
you take the second plane .
we can have a try at night .
does the peasant really know where the airfield is?
maybe .
ln this part of the world ; there's no room for error .
the airfield
is here .
we're here .
that's why they blocked the bridge !
they can't keep watch at night .
we have to start with the airfield .
at dawn .
lf we destroy it ; they'll only be able to warn their bases to the south .
we'll be on the bridge before then .
after ...
captain !
what?
there's not a car anywhere !
the war office have had 7 requests already .
but for different reasons .
it's crucial .
a surprise bombing of an enemy airfield is stupid if it's not done at night .
and if they attack ...
let's hope for clouds !
as for the cars ;
we'll have to ask the villagers .
are the two crews ready?
only two?
come and see ; political commissary !
that's the one they're repairing?
what about the reserve?
we've been expecting the engines for 6 months .
so tonight ; zero fighter planes?
no ; they won't be back from madrid .
the main thing is to find some headlights .
let's go get the cars .
the one we shot down yesterday .
they've improved them .
look at their machine gun .
but we still have a chance !
hurry up !
to take off at night , the two men
ask the peasants to lend them cars , so they can light up the airfield
with their headlights .
i'm in charge of the airfield .
i need some cars .
we're leaving tonight and i've no lights .
we need car headlights .
and i don't have any cars .
nor does the war office .
you do have cars .
3 cars and 2 trucks .
you need 1 2 cars !
it's a matter of life and death for our comrades up there .
we can't loan you the cars without our men .
they've already worked 1 5 hours today .
our mechanics will drive .
the drivers can sleep in the cars .
when do you want them?
3 o'clock at the latest .
these cars and a few fires should do the trick .
we'd crash into the orange trees !
we'll do what we can .
three at least ; i promise .
and more if possible .
we still have to ensure supplies get through .
see if you can sort it out with the other villages .
aviation .
i understand your needs ; but a promise is a promise ;
and i can't .
we'll do the best we can ; like the others .
3 cars !
you're the last people we can ask .
we'll do our best .
let's go ; sleepyhead !
how many cars?
five .
let's hope there'll be more .
who are they?
volunteers .
what for?
to carry the supplies .
where are the trucks?
they're at the airfield to help you out .
and he just puffs away in peace !
you're back ; captain .
how many cars?
they're coming .
i told them where to put them .
when the whistle blows ; they'll turn on their lights .
we'll all crash into the orange trees ...
twelve?
very good .
we'll come out at 5 o'clock .
tell your comrades not to be scared .
we won't crash into them .
ls there no other landmark than teruel?
after that ; follow the saragossa road up to the peasant's village .
beyond silos .
i hope he recognizes it .
we'll go straight to the bridge .
it'll be daylight .
too late for them .
we're 400 meters off course .
presently ; we'll be going through clouds .
land !
ours?
no ... theirs .
we must be over teruel .
there'll be gaps in the clouds .
make a turn now .
ls that teruel?
that's teruel?
does he recognize it?
there's the saragossa road !
go up again !
bearing 27 4 .
their field must be 20 kms . from here .
5 minutes .
lf we don't find it right away ... we'll get caught by their fighters .
the clouds are hiding us .
looks like teruel hasn't spotted us yet .
they haven't fired .
what's he up to?
doesn't he recognize it?
lf he doesn't spot it ; what then?
must be around here .
dive !
there are mountains !
not that way .
go on .
the clouds are getting lower .
i'm going down to 200 meters .
lf there are any mountains ; we'll be in trouble .
do i turn?
no time .
follow the road !
ls that your village?
there's the saragossa road .
where's the landing field?
lower !
there it is !
the fighters are coming !
open fire on the bunker !
ready?
ready !
climb !
our bombs might damage us as they explode .
altimeter 300?
300 .
take aim .
their fighters aren't far now .
and us ; with our 1 91 3 machine guns !
it's migration time .
boys ; the captain's coming back !
how about that for a nice piece of work !
all thanks to our mascot !
hey ; catch this !
too far for the vertical ; pujol .
turn ; for chrissakes !
dive !
don't worry ; others will be coming .
they're back !
put a tourniquet on .
rear turret ; they're coming back !
they're flying away !
our fighters are coming .
we're falling ...
only one engine left .
suppose we glide?
pujol ... are you wounded?
climb !
the mountain !
pull up !
shut your face !
the first plane is back at base .
the captain , informed by telephone that a plane has crashed in the hills ; goes to rescue his men .
they're not there .
the comrade says they crashed higher up .
ln the mountains .
higher up ; there's only valdelinares .
shall i call?
bullets?
the man who was here before was one of us .
on july 1 8th ; he phoned madrid and ...
first of all ;
they spoke of mora hospital .
no one at the town hospital .
no one
at the school hospital .
then ; linares .
no one there either .
now ; higher up ; in the mountains ...
they called mora to ask for a doctor for the wounded pilots ; so maybe ...
he ; too ; wants to be a pilot !
it's one of the pilots .
it's you ; pujol?
who's dead?
wounded?
who's able to walk?
yes .
on mules .
are they taking care of you?
they're doing their best .
let me talk to the doctor .
can you make up some stretchers?
i'll bring some .
start going down .
i'll wait for the ambulance .
it'll go as high up as it can .
take down the dead too .
aren't the pilots with you?
no ; they're going down the ravine .
phone them and tell them .
i must stay here .
lf i could go ; i would .
what use would you be?
i'm going !
me too .
to carry stretchers?
you can hardly stand !
i'll do what i can .
you'll have to help .
what can you do for the dead?
be grateful to him .
can you see?
a little .
i can see you .
want anything?
i want her to go to hell with her broth !
where's the ambulance?
it'll take us a good hour to get down .
got a mirror?
the one with the face wound mustn't drink .
but i used our last chicken ...
never mind .
my son's at the front ; too .
we're from val de san garcia .
what can we do?
talk to the doctor .
you mustn't let him drink ; even if he asks you to .
so you shot down their plane?
i'll never have a chance to do it again .
of course you will .
the ambulance is here .
you and i know that's not true .
with a bullet in the stomach ; i've got 3 hours .
look at the time .
give me my flying suit .
ask the doctor for his flying suit .
it's all the same to me ...
i could've fallen ill and died in the mines .
you know ... during the fight ; they all held up their mascots ; like kids .
i looked at them .
tell them i never had contempt for them .
please ...
the way i looked at them embarrassed them .
it's not that i despised them ... but that i understood i was old .
the suits are at the town hall .
what do you want?
maybe i can get it for you .
a revolver .
i've had my time .
i don't need any longer .
not till you've seen the doctor .
not till i've seen the doctor ...
where are they from?
one's german ; the other's french ...
and that one?
spanish .
and that one?
an arab .
