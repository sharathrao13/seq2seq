yes .
what are you preparing?
can i help?
no .
are you hungry?
help yourself in the fridge .
i'm going out .
i can't spend the evening indoors .
i said i'd never touched a machine .
it's not true .
i was an apprentice for a year when i was 16 , but i didn't stay .
i thought so .
the flat isn't mine .
it belongs to a woman and her daughter who are in the hospital .
i'm looking after the flat .
what have they got?
they were in a car crash .
you've always lived in lille?
i was born in the suburbs .
and you never moved?
i'm going to make some money and split !
i don't like the grey and the cold .
it's awful here .
concert tickets?
half price .
where?
the plaza .
eighty for one , 160 for two .
half price , my ass !
we're broke .
what you got?
nothing .
one hundred for two .
stop waving them in our faces !
we're broke .
we don't want them !
what's the plaza?
ls it far?
let's try to get in .
how do you expect to get in?
let's try .
we can always come back .
hello .
we haven't got any money .
can you let us in?
if you need money , get a job , darling .
i know .
but it's halfway through .
be cool , let us in , will you?
i'll push the barrier .
put that barrier back !
put that barrier back .
that's clear enough !
wait , i'm asking for permission .
you think i want to fight?
fredo , it's for you .
you want to get in?
yes .
i'll tell you why it isn't possible .
the people playing music ... they've worked hard , they've come a long way , they have to be paid .
we want to see them .
the rental of the hall , none of it's free .
are you paying them?
no , i'm not paying them .
and there are technicians , too .
two people , two girls !
who'll notice in the crowd?
i will !
and you're interrupting me .
interrupting?
we're talking !
what's your problem?
say yes or no .
anyway , what's it to you?
you're not the boss .
the little brunette can go in .
not the other one .
what will i do alone?
i'm not going in without her .
asshole !
what did you say?
let's blow !
push off !
you want to fight , fatty?
wake up , marie .
we're late .
what's that?
how many have you made?
i don't know .
a lot .
what?
have you seen what you've done?
how many have you made?
look at this !
shoddy work !
she's mad !
we can't use this .
what's the matter?
we don't need girls like you !
you don't know how to work .
go !
tell me what's wrong .
we can't use this .
it's a waste !
stop it !
what's the problem?
take your jacket and go !
take your jacket !
look , she's sewn them inside out .
what is this?
everything's inside out !
you're occupying a machine when lots of women are waiting .
what is this?
stop using the machine .
all right , i'm going .
go .
you're losing us money .
to hell with this job .
i'm not going back .
no , it's work .
you have to go .
have you seen how he treats us?
shut up and sew !
you can stay at the flat .
at least we've got that .
i can?
do you have money saved up?
no , nothing .
when i have no money , i sell cards .
look .
i make them .
i sell them for 10 or 20 francs .
to people in the street?
yes , you make up any old story .
i'll give you some .
i don't beg .
it's humiliating .
why , it isn't humiliating .
when people refuse?
you move on .
look , fredo , our two little dodgers .
no one told you to sit here !
we sit where there's room .
by the way , which one of you called me fat last night?
fat?
fat .
i heard the word " fat .
i don't know .
not us .
really?
not you .
hi , fredo .
hi , luis .
what about manu?
drop manu , will you?
get the message?
what are you doing tonight?
couldn't we work at your concerts?
hear that , fredo?
what would you do?
i don't know .
look after the singers .
what do the girls do?
there aren't any girls .
at concerts , you drink the wine , load the trucks ... and anything that moves gets jumped on .
you don't know what you're in for .
you've never been in the shit?
who , me?
you let him jump you to get this job?
you're lucky you're a chick !
don't talk like that to fredo or he'll do you !
he mustn't talk to marie like that .
she's just getting the wrong message .
i never said i wanted to do you .
who are you anyway?
just a bouncer .
you can't get us a job .
all on your own !
i'd like to see in 15 years how you end up !
you think we need you?
don't bother coming to any concerts .
you're banned .
the master of the world !
calm down .
this is our table .
get lost !
keep calm , fredo .
he'll land you one if you keep insulting him .
i'm not insulting you .
what is this?
enough !
we haven't even introduced ourselves .
charlie .
marie .
charlie .
isa .
fredo .
fredo , he said .
can i come in?
i've made breakfast .
cool .
shall i put it here?
what time is it?
it's 12 : 00 .
shit .
have you eaten?
no .
join me , then .
shall i open the curtains?
i'd been working for a week .
he didn't seem to be interested in me .
one day when he wasn't expecting it , i jumped on him .
he was having a nap , and bam !
it was a house i was redoing down south .
he was living with his mother .
she was great .
she was a painter .
she was doing great stuff .
i ended up almost living with them .
then we finished the job .
during the last days , i didn't know whether to talk to him or not .
whether he wanted me to stay or for it to end like that .
we never talked about our feelings .
it wasn't easy .
and then , on the last day , i packed our gear with the mason .
and i didn't know what to do , and the fool still said nothing .
so , i said good bye to him like to the others .
i walked to the truck ... and at each step i hoped he'd tell me to stay .
he let me get into the truck ... and that was that .
later i regretted not saying anything .
it wasn't up to you .
you wouldn't have?
no .
it was a stupid ending .
it wasn't your fault .
if he'd wanted , he'd have asked you to stay .
maybe he was afraid i'd invade his life .
maybe if i'd had my own place it would have been different .
he slept with you because you were available .
a girl on the road .
it was practical .
maybe he was waiting with each step for me to turn around .
we'll never know .
you're torturing yourself , and you dream a lot .
have you got a guy?
don't you like the bouncer?
are you crazy?
you were in his bed !
i didn't think you'd screw him .
i didn't screw him .
we drank , you went to sleep .
what about fredo?
he fancies you .
no , thank you !
i don't like him .
he freaks me out .
he's weird .
charlie said they don't only do the concerts .
they're also bouncers for this club , the blue .
he gave me his number , but i won't call .
i don't get stuck on guys .
they get on my nerves .
you're not answering?
no .
it's for them anyway .
been to see them in the hospital?
i don't know them .
i got the flat through my aunt .
besides , they're in a coma .
both of them?
yes , i think so .
have you settled in?
do what i did .
just move her stuff .
but what if they come back and i'm here?
we'll see .
we'll say i'm your cousin from brittany .
you're putting me up .
all right .
i am starting this diary on a sunny day .
like a mirror for me to know who i am .
i feel things inside , overwhelming things .
i feel my pulse beating .
i'm confused , nervous .
like something missing , a desire ...
i can't yet control .
on the edge of an abyss , i feel this crazy urge to jump .
what are you doing , for christ's sake?
it isn't a pancake , it's a ..
classy !
it's not a sword fight !
you need practice .
do you like them?
yes .
the woman painter gave them to me .
i didn't expect her to .
take one .
but they were a gift !
go ahead .
i swear .
i want you to have one .
choose the one you prefer .
it's yours .
this one .
it's yours .
thanks .
we'll find you another .
one with a car .
we'll go for a long ride .
anyway , we'll have a drink .
let's see .
a guy for you .
he's too old .
wait , marie .
he's super sexy .
there's one !
he's too good looking !
hello .
i need to talk to you .
sorry to bother you , but i have a message from my friend , marie .
she's been following you for several months .
she's shy , but she knows everything about you .
you're a great guy and you've got a lot of money ... but she's shy and comes from a more modest background .
these things happen .
she wants to know if the little detail of class matters ... or if it's love that counts .
i'm sorry , i'm in a hurry .
marie , she's pretty .
pretty name .
like in a fairy story .
look at the way he walks !
he's uptight .
let's follow him .
come on , run !
wait , i've got something to tell you .
open the window !
we're looking for a chauffeur for the afternoon .
sorry , it's my day off .
just a little ride .
i've just cleaned my car .
how old are you?
got your license?
hi , charlie !
hi , fredo !
stuck outside?
did they throw you out?
not too cold , is it?
no , we're used to it .
found work yet?
still looking .
got a couple of things lined up .
if you're looking for work ...
the hollywood is looking for girls .
the what?
the hollywood .
do you know the hollywood?
a club and a restaurant .
in the shopping center .
do you know it?
they'll hire us as waitresses?
not good enough for you?
careful .
out of the way .
let us do our job .
how many?
six .
i see !
i get it .
you sort out the good from the bad .
that's right .
and you'll let us in?
how much is the admission?
if we let you in , we'll be left out here on our own .
that's not nice .
if you didn't know me , would you let me in?
not like that .
she could grow her hair , you could have yours done ... a little makeup , you wear a dress ..
try and look like girls .
what a job !
you just judge people by their appearance .
great !
not again !
if you want to go in , go in !
in that stuffy joint?
i wouldn't be caught dead !
here's the boss .
shit !
the guy whose light i busted !
you're right .
hi , fredo .
hi , charlie .
everything okay?
yes , everything's fine .
see you later .
he's the boss?
yes , he's the boss .
some get an early start !
he's young .
that's true .
what did he do to own this place?
easy .
he was born into it .
see the grande brasserie over there?
his dad owns that .
we're free on thursday .
let's hook up .
we don't know what we're doing .
you don't know .
we'll call you .
yeah , like last time .
good bye , boys .
good night .
yeah , right , good night .
walk in the light !
is marie there?
yes , she's in .
i'm her mother .
hello .
come in .
shall i get her?
your mum's here .
why are you here?
i was in lille .
i tried to call earlier .
you could say hello .
i wanted to see the flat .
as you can see , it's a flat .
it's okay .
let's go down to the cafe across the street .
wait .
isa , we're just going for a drink .
i came on my own .
he can't get about easily .
sure .
let's go .
let's have lunch .
all right .
remi , i love you .
does remi know how to say " i love you "?
remi has blue eyes , white legs , a scrawny neck ... cauliflower ears and a willie the shape of ..
woke up expecting something to happen .
nothing .
excitement .
she'll bring him here and they'll screw .
she'll say , " hush !
sandrine's sleeping .
what a bummer , my mother with a guy like that .
if i put a carving knife ... under her mattress , he won't be able to get an erection .
i've come to see sandrine val .
which ward?
i don't know .
she's in a coma .
neurology then .
professor delacour's ward .
take the lift , second floor , corridor b.
ask for the nurses 'office .
she's unconscious , she can't communicate .
she can't talk or move .
she won't answer you .
we're watching for any sign of her waking or of an improvement .
spend some time with her .
if the sound of your voice triggers off a sign ...
let me or one of the nurses know .
it's very important .
her mother died a few days after the accident .
doctor , please?
excuse me .
i'll be right back .
hello , sandrine .
you've eaten well again .
visits seem to give you an appetite .
i'll make you comfortable .
there you are .
you'll catch cold like that .
the tips of her fingers are always cold .
she still has a slight temperature .
are you a relative?
one of her friends?
yes .
guess what i've just done .
lent my mother 1, 000 francs .
christ !
i'm broke and i have to give her money !
because she's married to a jerk !
your father?
yes .
she says he wants to see me again .
has it been a long time?
four years , since i left .
she seems fine .
she isn't nice , she's a victim .
it's different .
did you notice?
she never looks you in the eye .
do you still see your parents?
my mother .
when i can , or i write .
i get on well with her .
what does she do?
she works in a shoe factory in valence .
and your father?
they only stayed together a year .
my father married again and had other children .
i went to live with them for a while , but i went back to my mum .
it was cooler with her .
you're lucky your parents separated .
mine stayed together .
maybe in four years your father's changed .
my father's mad , that doesn't change .
now he's really sick so he's calmed down .
what did you do today?
i visited sandrine at the hospital .
her mother's dead .
she's still in a coma .
they don't know how long the coma can last .
she could stay like that and grow old on her bed .
i'll go back and see her .
what for?
she doesn't seem to get any visits .
it might do her good .
what a drag !
if her mother's dead , we'll get thrown out .
those of you who've just arrived , fill in the forms ... and attach your photos .
think of your favorite star , lauren bacall , dietrich , garbo ..
if you've already been a waitress , say where and for how long .
two on the photo .
how can we tell who's who?
who's isabelle tostin?
there are two on the photo .
i'm isabelle tostin .
you worked at the dukes , like marie thomas .
you're ms. thomas?
you're inseparable , like lovebirds .
does the idea of working at the hollywood make you feel like stars?
yes , absolutely !
who's your favorite star , isabelle?
madonna .
madonna , okay .
could you do something like madonna?
yes .
like in concert?
like on tv?
all right .
or " like a virgin .
okay , very good .
marie , who's your favorite star?
no one .
i just came with my friend .
you must have a favorite star .
yes , marie , lauren bacall .
she doesn't know me well enough .
you said lauren bacall .
lauren bacall , go on , marie .
there you are , lauren bacall .
all right .
you aren't very affectionate , are you?
i am .
well , you've had me .
you should be glad .
yes .
why do you say that?
you've had me , too .
well , no .
what do you mean , no?
i don't want you .
so you make love to a guy you don't fancy , is that it?
you just screw around .
that must be it .
with all of them?
i didn't expect to end up in your bed .
i didn't expect to end up with a fat guy .
a fat guy .
i don't think of myself as fat .
it's just a question of vocabulary .
you okay?
what about you , not flattened?
did you sleep with fredo?
he fancies you a lot .
are we going?
on the bikes?
shit , my scarf .
what are you doing?
i've forgotten my scarf .
hurry up , we'll be late .
shall i see you tomorrow?
i don't want to go too fast .
can you say that to my face?
have you got any money?
i'm fine .
here .
he gave me 200 francs .
cool !
coming !
could you wait outside?
i have to finish this .
i won't be long .

follow my finger again .
go on .
go on , continue .

she'd like that .
she's sleeping , but she can hear you .

the grass smelled of damp wood ... because it often rained .
very old , tall trees .
the sound of the river hidden beneath the brambles .
the black crows ... their yellow beaks .
the fresh air stinging our cheeks .
february 18 .
sunshine at last .
school excursion to honfleur .
we left all together .
i felt completely with the others .
at one with them .
i was lau , i was marc , i was remi .
maybe it was the strong wind on the beach which mixed us .
in the coach , i sat next to remi .
i fell asleep ... and when i woke up , my head was leaning on his shoulder .
he was asleep , too .
christ , you scared me !
what are you doing in the dark?
nothing .
i just got home .
what time is it?
11 : 00 .

he'll call back .
their tour seems to be going well .
what did you do?
nothing .
i just hung around .
i'm dead beat .
i'm going to bed .
i wonder if she can hear .
you know , when you speak , if she understands .
yesterday i tried something .
she has a diary .
i found it in her desk .
i read it to her .
maybe she can hear?
what came over you?
she gave you permission to go through her things?
she's completely unconscious .
she hears a strange voice tell her story !
she'll think she's hearing voices .
i don't believe it !
she must have been petrified !
what did you do?
sit down next to her , open her diary and read it?
you thought she'd answer , give a sign?
no , but ..
i don't know .
what?
the hollywood?
hello .

i'd like to explain to everyone .
i have to lace up the skates .

this guy on a scooter goes by ... and says , " hang on to me .
so i hang on and put out my hand for solene to hang on ..
but you were already far .
