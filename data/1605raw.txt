steven , what's going on?
steven , what's going on here?
i apologize .
my neighbor's on the same remote .
i bet my life on this game !
we're missing the game !
hi , ben .
we got a good football game going on here .
my kids want to watch mister rogers .
i don't care what you're watching .
just show a little mercy with that thing !
steve , look at this guy !
move your set .
move yours .
there it is .
okay , don't move .
that's perfect .
tweety doesn't like that smell .
sweetheart , tweety can't smell a thing .
put a flower with him .
a flower?
okay .
for when he's hungry .
for when he's lonely .
and when it's nighttime .
it's okay .
'" now i lay me down to sleep ...
'" ... i pray the lord my soul to keep . '
oh , brother .
stifle it .
'" if i should die before i wake ... '
it did . '" ... i pray the lord my soul to take . '
that was lovely .
lovely , honey .
mom , when it rots , can we dig it up and see the bones?
robbie !
will you come on down out of the tree , please?
e. buzz !
can i get a goldfish now?
come and get it .
come and get it .
you're overfeeding them .
tweety two and tweety three want seconds .
you know what happens when you overfeed goldfish?
they grow up to be ... ... sharks !
good night .
mom , there's a big storm headed this way .
you'll be asleep by the time it gets here , if you hurry .
come on .
in you go .
good night .
good night .
okay , lights out .
closet light !
closet light !
my fault , my fault .
turn it on , mommy !
that enough?
okay?
good night , ma .
'night , mommy .
good night .
either i'm dead or i'm crazy .
well , you're not crazy , pete .
you mean i'm dead?
yes .
i'm ....
you mean i ....
this is for good?
you guessed it .
sleepwalking .
nocturnal somnambulism .
you know what?
i will bet you anything it's genetic .
i mean , carol anne last night , and all last week , you know .
and me when i was ten .
would you deal with this for me?
sure .
you know ....
you know , once i slept walked four blocks .
and i fell asleep in the back of this guy's car .
he drove all the way to work before discovering me .
god , i woke up , i started screaming .
people came running from everywhere .
they called the cops .
the cops came .
they took this poor dude downtown .
my father ...
big .... ... ed .
big ed has me examined for bruises and hickeys .
you name it .
god , i was so embarrassed .
shit , steven .
what if we dig the pool and carol anne sleepwalks ... ... and she falls into it before there's any water?
honey , no .
have you ever dove off a three meter board , sweetheart?
what's three meters?
it's about ten feet .
let's just dig the pool closer to the house ... ... and let the kids jump off the roof .
honey , a three meter board , it's like an air pocket , sweetheart .
when you dive off , it's like free falling , okay?
you got to get your position now .
these feet are positioning .
honey?
three meters .
your diving days are over .
we're talking olympics , diane .
and then i can  let me see your tuck position .
then you can jackknife into the swan .
you twist , turn and ... ... splash !
honey , it's right to the nautilus machine .
look at this , honey .
before , after .
before , after .
don't .
i'm telling you .
i love you .
i love you !
you fool .
no , no !
god , i love it when you talk dirty .
the storm's getting closer .
hey , partner .
hi , honey .
is everything okay?
it's thundering .
come on .
hop up .
i'm the wind and you're the feather .
say good night to mom .
good night .
good night , sweetheart .
here we go .
i don't like the tree , dad .
it's an old tree .
it's been around here a long time .
it was here before my company built the neighborhood .
i don't like its arms .
it knows i live here , doesn't it?
it knows everything about us .
that's why i built the house next to it .
so it could protect us .
you and carol anne and dana and your mom and me .
it's a very wise old tree .
it looks at me .
it knows i live here .
i think the storm's gonna pass us .
how do you know?
'cause i can count .
you know what you do?
when you see the lightning ... ... you count till you hear the thunder .
if you can count higher each time ... ... that means the storm's moving away from us .
want to try it?
okay .
get some lightning .
wait , it's coming .
okay .
one ... ... two , three .
okay , but i bet next time ... ... you'll be able to count to at least four or five .
betcha .
daddy , it's for you .
you tell them to take a message , sweetpea .
my dad wants to take a message .
good night .
it's too hot .
okay .
good night , angel .
happy dreams , okay?
good night , daddy .
one ... two ... ... three ... four .
did not !
come on .
good night , dana .
good night , dad .
get off the phone , dana .
one ... two ... ... three ... four ... ... five ....
don't take it so serious .
i told him to put ....
if that happens , i don't have a job .
hey !
look at this !
i love that swing .
i love you !
i love you !
i love you !
i love it !
no !
e. buzz , no .
get down .
robbie !
carol anne !
i've told you guys to push your chairs in when you're done at the table .
honey , you're gonna ruin your eyes .
this is not good for you .
what's the matter , e. buzz?
what are you doing?
how is it?
great , mrs. freeling .
okay , bluto .
give me my cup .
you sure make good coffee .
jesus !
don't do that , honey .
you want to see mommy lying in a cigar box covered with licorice?
did you do this?
you guys .
i asked you not to pull the chairs out .
tv people?
do you see them?
do you?
i tell you , i think you'll really enjoy this kitchen .
this is our latest development .
we call this phase 4 .
where do you live , mr. freeling?
well , we were the first family to set up housekeeping in cuesta verde estates .
phase 1 .
we had to pass through my neighborhood to get to this one .
the area with the lived in look .
it has that , but i think in a few months ... ... you won't be able to distinguish phase 1 from phase 3 to phase ....
you know , we have a saying around here .
the grass grows greener on every side .
that's the way i feel .
i can't tell one house from the other .
you know something?
i think you're right .
but i think our construction standards are very liberal .
i have this neighbor and he built a jacuzzi in his bedroom ... ... and it has a running aqueduct connected to a wading pool outside .
it's built half in and half out of his living room .
that house was featured in town and country .
come on , i'll show you the den .
honey !
come here !
quick !
hurry !
before it stops again .
what about the cans?
leave this here .
right .
they don't make the pick ups yet .
okay , just stand right here .
okay?
listen , i kept dana and robbie out of this ... ... but carol anne was here so she knows .
but dana would blab , and robbie , he'd be up for three weeks ...
... sleeping on your side of the bed .
no , you should sit down .
no , no .
now just stand ... okay?
now , just be calm .
okay .
now reach back into our past when you used to have an open mind .
remember that?
okay .
just try to use that for the next couple of minutes .
okay?
yeah , okay .
mother didn't cook any dinner .
we'll go to pizza hut , okay?
okay , now ....
now just look .
just look .
just watch .
come here , sweetheart .
honey , could you move the chair out of the way and just stay down there .
come on , let's show daddy .
i'm hungry !
don't argue with mommy .
come on .
come on , let's just do this once .
okay , here we go .
i want pepperoni pizza .
mommy , that burns .
i'm sorry .
the floor needs more wax .
steven , come on , you do it .
no .
come on , honey , try .
it's like there's this tickling , you know , right in here .
and it starts to pull you .
the tickling pulls you .
suddenly , it's like there's no air except that you can breathe .
and you're getting pulled along and ....
hi , ben .
mr. tuthill .
hi .
if you're having problems with your set ....
that's not it .
no .
it's nothing like that .
diane and i were just wondering ....
this will sound strange coming from me ....
i doubt that .
those mosquitoes are something else .
they're really chowing down .
i've never been bothered by them .
in fact , i don't think i've ever been bitten by one .
as far as i know , nobody in my family's ever been affected by them .
a mosquito ever suck on you , son?
i don't know , dad .
he don't know .
look , mr. tuthill ....
ben .
ben .
i'm really sorry .
mr. tuthill , look ....
we were just ....
what we were wondering is ....
look .
diane , my wife , and i were wondering ....
ben , something funny is going on here next door .
something ....
we were wondering if maybe you had experienced any disturbances lately .
what kind of disturbances?
you know ... ... dishes or furniture moving around by themselves .
don't scratch them .
you'll infect them .
just let me put this on .
okay .
don't !
boy , did i feel like a fool .
i'm sorry , but i had to say it .
we were losing pints of blood .
we'll keep this thing in the family .
don't scratch .
tomorrow , i'll call somebody in .
yeah?
who , for instance?
i looked in the yellow pages .
furniture movers , we got .
strange phenomenon , no listing .
one , 1, 000 , two , 1, 000 , three , 1, 000 ... ... four , 1, 000 , five , 1, 000 ....
honey , look ....
i'm the one who had to live with this freaky thing ... ... and nothing bad happened .
it's like another side of nature , a side we're not qualified to understand .
when you overreact like this , it makes what happened much too important .
no one's going in the kitchen till i know what's happening .
one , 1, 000 , two , 1, 000 , three , 1, 000 , four , 1, 000 ....
one , 1, 000 , two , 1, 000 , three ....
mommy !
mommy !
dad !
help me !
help me , dad !
help me !
honey , be careful !
mom !
mommy !
mom !
help me !
help me !
he's coming !
mom !
it's taking me in !
robbie !
it's hurting me !
steven , hurry !
parapsychology isn't something you master in .
there are no certificates of graduation ... ... no licenses to practice .
i am a professional psychologist ... ... but spend most of my time engaged in this ghostly hobby which makes me ... ... i suppose , the most irresponsible woman of my age that i know .
would you like a glass for that?
no , thank you .
you know , you were very funny .
your hands were shaking about a mile a minute .
it isn't over .
i'm absolutely terrified .
it's all the things that we don't understand .
i feel like the protohuman , coming out of the forest primeval ... ... and seeing the moon for the first time and throwing rocks at it .
if i got killed , would i come back as a ghost and get stuck in the house ... ... like my sister?
your sister isn't dead , robbie .
if i got killed , could i visit her and show her how to get back here?
you could tie a rope around me and hold it , then somebody could come ... ... and get us and we'd go live somewhere else .
some people believe that when you die your soul goes to heaven .
when grandpa was dead , i looked at him on the hospital bed and i was watching ... ... but i didn't see anything go up out of him .
his soul was invisible , robbie .
you couldn't see it .
but how come grandpa isn't on television with carol anne?
some people believe that when people die ... ... there's a wonderful light ... ... as bright as the sun .
but it doesn't hurt to look into it .
all the answers to all the questions that you ever want to know ... ... are inside that light .
and when you walk to it , you become a part of it forever .
and then ... ... some people die , but they don't know that they've gone .
do you think they're still alive?
yes .
maybe they didn't want to die .
maybe they weren't ready .
maybe they hadn't lived fully yet or they'd lived a long time ... ... but they still wanted more life .
they resist going into that light ... ... however hard the light wants them .
they just hang around ... ... watch tv , watch their friends grow up ... ... feeling unhappy and jealous ... ... and those feelings are bad .
they hurt .
and then ... ... some people ... ... just get lost on the way to the light .
and they need someone to guide them to it .
so , some people get angry and throw things around , like in my bedroom?
yes .
just like in school .
like some kids are nice to you , some kids are mean .
i got beat up once by three kids .
they took my lunch money .
maybe they got hit by a truck and are upstairs right now .
listen , partner , maybe we ought to get some shut eye , okay?
okay .
you know what?
when we called grandma tonight , she got really excited ... ... that you're coming to stay with her ... ... and she's planning all these neat things for you guys to do .
can i take e. buzz with me when we go?
sure you can .
good night , mom .
good night , sweetie .
good night , lady .
good night , dad .
good night , rob .
i love you .
good night , carol anne .
i'm gonna go get something to eat .
okay .
thanks .
what is it?
what is it?
roll it back !
i think we've got one .
i think it recorded .
yes , it recorded !
look at all of them .
is that our house?
who are all those people?
they're so lonely .
so alone .
where are they coming from?
i don't know .
robbie?
call me , okay?
this cameo is over 100 years old .
yeah , some haul .
and this watch is only a few years old .
and it's not yours .
no .
well , i'm off .
i'm taking these back to the lab along with the tapes .
i'm gonna have to display these , you know .
please , not on 60 minutes .
or that's incredible .
i'll get it .
excuse me .
i'm leaving ryan here with you .
marty won't be coming back .
i am coming back .
and i'll bring some help .
try not to worry .
thank you .
we've missed you down at the office .
the boys have gotten worried , so ... ... i took it upon myself to
jesus , steve , you look like shit .
aren't you feeling any better?
i'm still weak .
i've got the flu .
i can't get up and i  looks like you got some cable problems .
yeah , well , move over here .
cable's been off for a couple months .
we'll have to look into that .
the rest of the block dark , too?
no , it's just us .
got some electrical problems as well here .
what have you got screwed in there?
a 300 watt bulb?
you afraid of burglars or you trying to attract every insect in cuesta verde?
steve , tell me something .
are you happy here?
yes , i am .
forgive me for asking these questions ... ... but we don't want to lose the best rep we've ever had ... ... to the flu or other opportunities .
seeing all that software in your living room makes me wonder if , well ... ... maybe you got something on the side .
no , i just read popular mechanics .
i got hobbies .
feel like going for a little ride?
i'd like to show you something .
hello?
carol anne?
i'm sorry !
one of your children was born in your house?
carol anne .
i understand that she's missed a lot of school .
one of trask's daughters is in the same nursery class .
she caught the flu as well?
yeah , we've all got the same thing .
i'm sorry .
i didn't see her .
she's around .
listen , i wonder if you'd mind if i asked you a question .
are you leaving cuesta verde?
it's hard to believe the day could be this beautiful .
how could anyone in the world have a problem on a day like this?
how's that spot for a bay window?
it's pretty nice if you're living up here , but not so great down there in the valley ... ... looking at those homes cutting into the hillside .
you don't have to live in the valley anymore .
what are you saying?
we're starting phase 5 right here where we're standing .
all of this can be your master bedroom suite .
that can be your view .
interested?
mr. teague , that's a generous offer .
i'm just not a developer .
you're responsible for 42 percent of sales .
that's almost half of everything there ... ... almost $70 million worth of dwelling and properties .
now that's a whole generation of security ... ... that nobody can put a price tag on .
look , i know we should have made you a full partner three years ago .
i don't want to lose you now .
not much room for a pool , is there?
we own all the land .
we've already made arrangements for relocating the cemetery .
you're kidding .
come on .
that's sacrilegious , isn't it?
don't worry about it .
after all , it's not an ancient tribal burial ground .
it's just ... ... people .
besides , we've done it before .
when?
in 1976 .
right down there .
cuesta verde?
all 300 acres .
and let me tell you , it was quite a deal .
but i never heard anything about it .
it's not something one advertises on a billboard ... ... or on the side of a bus .
what's worrying you?
friends and relatives can visit their loved ones in broxton memorial park .
it's only five minutes further , for christ's sake .
five minutes .
you know , that's no great hardship .
i suppose that would be okay .
okay with whom?
whomever might complain .
nobody's complained until now .
we've had two experiences in the kitchen .
this is the den .
would y'all mind hanging back?
you're jamming my frequencies .
so , what side of the rainbow are we working tonight , dr. lesh?
is this your knott's berry farm solution?
i know what you're thinking .
but you must take my word for it .
she's cleaned many houses .
her gifts have been documented
look , we haven't heard carol anne since last night .
why is this door locked , mr. freeling?
answer her , steven !
i am .
i am addressing the living .
i'm sorry .
that's the room my son and daughter used to occupy .
we believe it's the heart of the house .
this house has many hearts .
what is the matter?
what's the matter?
i was trying to answer her with my mind and she couldn't hear me .
didn't you say tangina barrons was an extraordinary clairvoyant?
i am .
i just don't like trick answers .
come here , honey ... ... and give me your hand .
i'm not gonna bite you .
come on down here .
you're gonna give me whiplash looking up at you .
your daughter is alive and in this house .
where was the last incident of '" bilocation? '
i get my strongest feeling ... ... the point of origin is in the child's closet upstairs .
yes , i believe that , too .
now honey , you're gonna be strong for me and for your daughter .
i can do absolutely nothing without your faith ... ... in this world and your love for the children .
i will .
believe me , i will .
and will you do anything i ask ... ... even if it comes contrary to your beliefs as a human being and a christian?
yes , i promise .
please .
would you all come on in?
gather round .
there is no death .
it is only a transition ... ... to a different sphere of consciousness .
carol anne is not like those she's with .
she is a living presence ... ... in their spiritual , earthbound plane .
they're attracted to the one thing about her ... ... that is different from themselves : her life force .
it is very strong .
it gives off its own illumination .
it is a light that implies life ... ... and memory of love and home ... ... and earthly pleasures ... ... something they desperately desire ... ... but can't have anymore .
right now , she's the closest thing to that ... ... and that is a terrible distraction ... ... from the real light ... ... that has finally come for them .
do you understand me?
these souls , who , for whatever reason ... ... are not at rest ... ... are also not aware that they have passed on .
they're not part of consciousness as we know it .
they linger in a perpetual dream state ... ... a nightmare from which they cannot awake .
inside this spectral light ... ... is salvation .
a window to the next plane .
they must pass through this membrane ... ... where friends are waiting to guide them to new destinies .
carol anne must help them cross over .
and she will only hear ... ... her mother's voice .
now ... ... hold onto yourselves .
there's one more thing .
a terrible presence is in there with her .
so much rage , so much betrayal .
i've never sensed anything like it .
i don't know what hovers over this house ... ... but it was strong enough to punch a hole into this world ... ... and take your daughter away from you .
it keeps carol anne very close to it ... ... and away from the spectral light .
it lies to her .
it says things only a child can understand .
it has been using her to restrain the others .
to her ... ... it simply is another child .
to us ... ... it is the beast .
now let's go get your daughter .
red ribbons ... ... handkerchiefs ... ... tennis balls .
rope's right here .
bath water?
i shut it off .
it's ready , too .
all right .
call to her .
carol anne , it's mommy .
can you hear me?
carol anne , please tell mommy hello .
try again .
can you say hello to daddy?
daddy and i miss you so much .
we love you so much .
please just say hello .
she's under restraint .
what?
who's restraining her?
there are many arms about her .
she thinks it's safe .
quickly !
who is she more threatened by , you or your husband?
neither !
steve decides the punishment .
the children know that .
that's not fair .
i've never hit her .
fight later !
steven , make carol anne answer you !
carol anne?
it's daddy .
be cross with her .
be angry with her , or you'll never see her again .
carol anne , i want you to answer me !
tell her if she doesn't answer you , she'll get a spanking .
come on , i've never spanked the children .
honey , please , just tell her .
carol anne?
answer your parents or you'll get a real spanking from both of us !
mommy , help me !
she's away from him .
away from whom?
is she all right?
diane , ask about the light .
mommy , help me , please .
carol anne?
honey , do you see a light?
help me , please !
mommy !
mommy , help me !
tell her to go to the light .
no !
they'll follow her like they've followed her for weeks .
now tell her !
you must do what i say .
it's all right .
tell her , diane .
mommy , i can't find you !
run to the light , carol anne !
run as fast as you can !
are you in the light?
no .
tell her you are .
no !
it's a lie !
you can't choose life or death when we're dealing with what's in between .
tell her before it's too late .
run to the light , baby !
mommy's in the light !
tell her you're waiting for her .
mommy is waiting for you in the light !
i hate you for this .
now clear your minds .
it knows what scares you .
it has from the very beginning .
don't give it any help .
it knows too much already .
now , open the door .
ryan !
get downstairs and wait by the target !
okay !
steven !
give me the tennis ball marked number one !
dr. lesh !
it's my handwriting !
it came right out of thin air !
the ball came back !
it's his handwriting .
kiss my ass !
number two !
diane !
give me your hand !
she's at the mouth of the corridor !
tell her to stop !
tell her not to go into the light !
carol anne?
listen to me !
do not go into the light !
stop where you are !
turn away from it !
don't even look at it !
hurry with the rope !
throw it into the light !
fantastic !
i got it !
tell him to take up the slack gently .
take up the slack !
take up the slack !
okay !
help me tie this around my waist !
what are you doing?
i'm going in after her !
she won't come to you !
let me go !
you've never done this before .
neither have you !
you're right !
you go !
no !
no !
let me !
you can't !
who's strong enough to stay up here and hold the rope?
i love you !
no !
no !
go downstairs and wait by ryan ... ... and pull only when i say so !
only when i say !
steven !
don't let go !
never !
it's coming .
how will we know she's got her?
when will we know?
cross over , children !
all are welcome !
all welcome .
go into the light !
no !
no !
you said , '" no '" !
there is peace and serenity in the light .
you said don't go into the light !
diane !
diane !
steven , not yet !
diane !
they're here !
they're back .
diane !
no , please , no !
get them into the water !
no , no , no .
i'm helping you .
i'll get something ....
don't worry .
get them to the water .
she's all right .
she's gonna be all right .
you done good .
come on .
come on , breathe now .
just take a breath .
breathe , honey , breathe .
breathe , damn it !
breathe !
diane ... diane , breathe , breathe , breathe !
that's it .
come on , baby .
come on .
come on , breathe !
that's it , breathe .
baby .
sweetheart .
sweetpea , it's daddy .
come on , honey .
come on , pumpkin .
hi , daddy .
this house is clean .
be careful .
i'm going to dinner with janice and brian .
is your room packed?
everything but the bed .
mom?
will we sleep here tonight?
i guess not .
so you better get brian to bring you home right after dinner .
because dad wants us to stay at the holiday inn on i 74 .
i remember that place .
mom?
you what?
mom?
are you gonna do anything about this?
about what?
your new gray .
mom?
you don't like it?
you don't think it's kind of punk?
mom?
'bye , mom .
okay , rob .
that thing almost killed me .
you okay?
don't hurt your back .
fine .
