i think she still loves you .
i don't think so .
she doesn't stop talking about you .

you're a lucky guy , jake .
you must have friends in high places .
let's get down to orson .
i was going to vote for three , and i switched to two with some trepidation , because she said one over one , which means number one of an addition of one .
i think an artist would know that .
jake?
you're going to be all right , jake .
oh , you're going to be fine .
am i ...
am i home?
yeah .
you're right here .
home .
doctor says you're lucky your brains didn't boil .
what a night , jake , huh?
you were screaming and kicking ... and you kept saying ,
sarah , close the window , " over and over .
and talking to your kids , even the dead one .
weird , huh?
you know you melted 50 pounds of ice in 8 hours?
am i dead?
oh , no .
no .
you're right here .
doctor says you got to rest .
you see , he says you have a virus .
that's what they always say when they don't know what it is .
now , you just lie here , ok?
you know , you really ought to get out today .
you can't just sit around like this all the time .
it's not healthy .
it's not good for your mind .

but i've been laid up .
i've been sick .
i need to see you .
all right .
something's wrong , jake .
i don't know what it is , but i can't talk to anybody about it .
i mean , i figured i could talk to you .
you always used to listen , you know .
i'm going to hell .
that's as straight as i can put it .
and don't tell me that i'm crazy
'cause i know i'm not .
they're coming after me .
who is?
they've been following me .
they're coming out of the walls .
i can't trust anybody .
but i got to talk to somebody .
i got to talk to somebody , or i'm going to fly out of my fucking mind !
mind your business .
i don't know who they are or what they are , but they're going to get me , and i'm scared , jake .
i'm so scared , i can't do anything .
i can't go to my sister's .
i can't even ...
i can't even go home .
i don't know what to do .
paul?
shit .
paul , i know what you're talking about .
what do you mean?
i've seen them , too .
you've seen them?
i've seen them , too ...
everywhere , like a plague .
my god , i thought i was the only one .
yeah , me , too .
i thought i was going out of my mind .
i know , i know .
look , i carry these around everywhere with me , but they don't help .
nothing helps .
what happened?
what happened that night?
what have they done to us?
i don't know .
profile .
great .
that's it .
give it to him .
my lucky day .
be advised , we have heavy gunfire ...
mayday , mayday , mayday !
five minutes to da nang .
no , no .
you have to be strong for your children .
listen to what she's saying .
did anybody see the police report?
sounds like a bomb to me .
the paper said it was electrical .
it was an accident .
that's bullshit .
someone's covering something up .
that was no accident .
it was set , man .
why?
paul wasn't hated by anybody in the world .
what about when you went out?
did he say anything?
well , he was upset .
he thought people were following him .
yeah?
who?
he didn't know
demons .
demons?
what the fuck you talking about , demons?
he thought he was going to hell .
why did he say that?
what would make him say that?
i mean , that's strange .
what else did he say , jake?
he was scared .
he was seeing things
coming out of the woodwork .
they're trying to get me , " he said .
did he say what they were?
excuse me .
in one end and out the other , huh , george?
still a fucking spaz .
hope he can hold his dick better than he can his bottle .
what?
something weird is going on here .
paul isn't the first one who's died .
remember dr. carlson over at bellevue?
his car blew up , too .
dr. carlson's dead?
yeah .
an explosion just like paul's .
we got six guys here going fucking crazy .
well , not me , buddy .
ok , but the rest of us are going crazy .
think this has something to do with that night?
it's got something to do with something .
we have to go see the army .
they're not telling us something .
oh , come on , professor .
what makes you think the army's going to give you any answers?
you'll be butting up against a brick wall .
we'll get a lawyer .
you should find yourself a shrink .
you're all fucking paranoid .
it was bad grass .
that's all it was , man .
there's no such things as fucking demons .
come on .
carol , i'm going to need you with your pad in about 15 minutes .
well , i'm sorry ,
mr. singer , but you know how many people come to me with the injustices of the world?
it would break your heart .
mr. geary , this is very important to us .
the army did something to us , and we've got to find out what .
the army?
jeez , what's with you guys?
this is not a walk to the library .
this is the u. s. government .
this is red tape coming out your ass .
you know what i mean?
that's why we're here .
do you think you can help us?
what am i , perry mason?
all right .
i'll look into it .
you think we have a chance?
i need sworn depositions from all of you and a list of platoon members or their survivors .
this is great .
i'll tell you one thing .
if we do find that the military is implicated in this , you all stand to make quite a bit of money .
not that i can predict anything , but class action suits of this kind have been awarded fairly generous judgments .
that wouldn't be so bad , would it?
we're not in it for the money .
that's right .
right .
all right , gentlemen , who wants to go first?
i put a hungry man in the oven .
it will be ready at a quarter of .
ok .
there's a tossed salad in the fridge .
ok .
thanks .
i got you some apple juice .
no , not red cheek .
red cheek .
ah , shit .
don't drink it all .
all right .
oh , your lawyer called .
when?
when you were in the shower .
you didn't call me?
he didn't give me a chance .
he hung up on me .
look , jake , don't be upset , ok?
he's not taking your case .
what?
what do you mean?
he said you didn't have one .
what's he talking about?
i don't know .
he was very rude .
he said your friends backed out .
i don't believe this .
oh , baby , i feel terrible .
i'd stay , but i'm so late .
we'll talk when i get home , ok?
yeah .
are you all right?
yeah , i'm fine .
you sure?
give me a kiss .
i'll see you later .
bye , sweetheart .
hello?
frank , hi .
it's jake .
i just got a strange call from geary .
he said the guys backed down .
what's he talking about?
uh ...
yeah , that's right , jake , we did .
why?
i don't know .
it's hard to explain .
well , try .
you know , jake , um ...
war's war .
things happen .
things happen?
what does that mean?
i thought we were going to do something , frank .
there's nothing to do , jake .
who's been talking to you?
what's going on , frank?
i'll call the others .
they're not interested , jake .
what do you mean?
they're not interested .
we all talked about this .
we're all suffering the same symptoms .
listen , the army's hiding something from us .
we got to find out what it is .
uh , jake , i got to go .
no , no , no , wait .
hold on .
no , wait .
don't hang up .
jake , don't call back anymore , ok?
wait !
i can't do this by myself .
frank?
frank?
we'll get them this afternoon .
have a good lunch .
geary .
mr. geary .
excuse me .
who's been talking to you , huh?
the army?
have they been talking to you?
nobody's talking to nobody .
you don't have a case .
keep your hands off me .
leave me alone .
you can't walk away like this .
we need your help .
you need a doctor .
the army did something to me .
i got to prove it .
there's nothing i can do , all right?
just leave me alone .
something's going on here .
you're not telling me something .
what's wrong with you?
i'll tell you what's wrong .
i don't know you from adam .
you walk in with some bizarre o story and demand i check it out .
i did .
i don't know what you take me for , but you've used me .
used you?
i checked with the army .
you never even went to vietnam .
what's that supposed to mean?
you and your friends are wacko !
you were all discharged on psychological grounds after some war games in thailand .

frightening people with foolish talk about the army and experiments .
you're in over your head , mr. singer .

it's all pain .
straighten out your head .
relax .
you ever read meister eckhart?
no .
how did you get your doctorate without reading eckhart?
relax .
ok , good .
now turn over gently right side .
the other right , ok?
you're a regular basket case , you know that?
eckhart saw hell , too .
you know what he said?
he said the only thing that burns in hell is the part of you that won't let go of your life your memories , your attachments .
they burn them all away .
but they're not punishing you , he said .
they're freeing your soul .
relax .
good .
so the way he sees it ... if you're frightened of dying and you're holding on ... you'll see devils tearing your life away .
but if you've made your peace , then the devils are really angels freeing you from the earth .
it's just a matter of how you look at it , that's all .
so don't worry , ok?
ok?
good .
relax .
relax .
relax ...
and wiggle your toes .
come on , wiggle your toes .
perfect .
we got it .

i called every hospital in the city .
no , don't .
what's going on?
i'm not here .
you haven't seen me .
hello?

no .
i haven't seen him all night .
when do you expect him?
i don't know .
could you tell him something?
tell him i was in vietnam
vietnam?
there was a secret experiment
what experiment?
i need to see him as soon as possible .
hello .
this is jacob singer .
i was in country in '68 .
i was in a chemical warfare unit in saigon .
we conducted secret government experiments .
my god .
are you there?
yeah .
do you want to know more?
where can i meet you?
on 128th and westside highway in front of a coffee truck .
how will i know you?
you already know me .
i do?
yes .
make sure you're not followed , ok?
all right .
bye .
i knew it .
who was that?
a chemist .
part of a chemical warfare unit out of saigon .
i knew something was going on .
jake ... please don't go .
oh , i'm sorry .
jacob?
hi .
i'm michael newman .
yeah .
i told you you'd know me .
i've been tracking you for a long time .
i wish i'd spoken to you before tonight .
why are you following me?
you're one of the survivors , jacob .
come on .
we can't talk here .
it's not safe .
come on .
so , first i'm arrested , right?
best lsd i ever made right down the drain .
i figured , " this is it .
20 years in the can if i'm lucky .
that was 1968 .
long time ago .
really .
next thing i know , i'm on riker's island .
ever been there , man?
well , suddenly , they take me from my cell , they throw me in a waiting room with bank teller windows .
four army colonels with medals up their asses are standing on the other side .
they say to me , if i come to vietnam for two years
no action , just work in a lab they'll drop all charges and wipe the record clean .
i'd only been in jail 13 hours .
i knew 'nam couldn't be any worse .
shows how little you knew .
yeah , really .
they had me by the balls .
next thing i know , i'm in saigon .
i'm working in a top secret lab synthesizing mind altering drugs .
not the street stuff .
they had us isolating special properties the dark side .
they wanted a drug that increased aggressive tendencies .
they were scared .
they were worried .
they figured you guys were too soft , not fighting up to your potential .
they wanted something to stir you up , make you mad , you know , tap into your anger .
and we did it .
most powerful thing i ever saw .
even a bad trip , and believe me , i've had my share , do not compare to the fury of the ladder .
the ladder?
yeah .
that's what they called it .
a fast trip straight down the ladder right to the primal fear , right to the base anger .
i'm telling you , man , it was powerful .
i don't need to tell you .
you already know .
we did experiments on jungle monkeys .
it worked .
they bashed each other's heads in , gouged out their eyes , chewed off their tails .
the brass loved it .
then they made us try it on charlie .
we , uh ... took these pows , you know?
just kids , really .
and ... we put them in this courtyard ,
and we fed them huge doses of the stuff .
i mean , they were worse than the monkeys .
i didn't know men could do those things .
anyway , there was this big offensive coming up , right?
everyone knew it
time magazine , huntley , brinkley
and the brass were scared because they knew we couldn't win .
morale was down , it was getting ugly in the states .
you remember .
yeah .
so , a couple days later , they decide to use the ladder ... on one test battalion ...
yours .
just an infinitesimal dose in the food supply , they said , just to prove its effectiveness in the field .
they were sure your unit would have the highest kill ratio in the whole god damn offensive , and they were right you did except not the way they thought .
no one can remember that night .
i get flashes , but they don't make sense .
what happened?
was there an offensive?
yeah , a couple days later .
it was fierce , but you guys never saw it .
but there was an attack?
it was a fight , right?
yeah , but not with the cong .
with who?
you killed each other .
what?
it was brother against brother .
no discrimination .
you tore each other to pieces .
my god .
i knew it would happen .
i warned them .
i fucking warned them !
ohh , fuck .
i was just some hippie chemist , right?
what did i know?
fuck .
i talked to the guys who bagged the bodies .
they were in worse shape than you , believe me .
they saw what was left .
i needed to find you , you know?
i felt responsible .
the ladder was my baby .
i'm going to brooklyn .
not with me , you're not .
i get lost in brooklyn .
i know the way .
listen ...
this is all the money i have .
take me home , please .
where's your home?
dr. singer .
well ... it's been a long time .
hello , sam .
are you all right?
yeah , i'm ok .
do you want some help?
i can call upstairs .
no , no .
that's ok .
thanks , sam .
sarah?
jed?
eli?
if you're frightened of dying and you're holding on , you'll see devils tearing your life away .
if you've made your peace , then the devils are really angels freeing you from the earth .
gabe?
gabe?
hi , dad .
it's ok .
come on .
let's go up .
come on .
he's gone .
he looks kind of peaceful , the guy .
put up a hell of a fight , though .
what's the guy's name?
singer .
jacob singer .
i don't mind the gray skies
you make them blue
sonny boy
friends may forsake me
let them all forsake me
i still have you
sonny boy
you're sent from heaven
and i know your worth
you made a heaven for me here on earth
when i'm old and gray here
promise you won't stray , dear
for i love you so
sonny boy
