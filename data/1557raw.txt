mother !
what is it , dear?
what's the matter?
oh !
al malone , the deputy , just called .
he wants me over at the fawcett place .
some detectives from santa rosa will be there .
will you be alright?
yes .
i was just taking your mother in some tea .
oh , be careful , please .
and you be careful .
mitch?
no , it's me , mrs brenner .
i thought you might like some tea .
oh .
thank you .
where's mitch?
al malone wanted him
at the fawcett farm .
why?
didn't al believe my story?
he was calling from the farm .
then he saw .
oh , he must have .
they sent for the santa rosa police .
what good will they do?
do you think cathy's alright at the school?
yes , i'm sure she's fine .
do i sound very foolish to you?
oh , no .
i keep seeing dan's face .
and they have such big windows at the school .
all the windows are broken in dan's bedroom .
try not to think about that .
i wish i were a stronger person .
i lost my husband four years ago , you know .
it's terrible how you depend on someone else for strength , and then ... suddenly all the strength is gone , and you're alone .
i'd love to be able to relax sometime .
i'd love to be able to sleep .
do you think cathy's alright?
annie's there .
she'll be alright .
i'm not like this , you know?
not usually .
i don't fuss and fret about my children .
when frank died ...
you see , he understood the children .
he really understood them .
he had the knack of entering into their world , of becoming part of them .
that's a very rare talent .
yes .
oh , i wish , i wish , i wish i could be like that .
i miss him .
sometimes , even now , i wake up in the morning and i think , " i must get frank's breakfast .
and i get up , and there's a very good reason for getting out of bed , until , of course , i remember .
i miss talking to him .
cathy's a child , of course , and mitch ...
well , mitch has his own life .
i'm glad he stayed here today .
i feel safer with him here .
would you like to rest now?
no .
no , don't go .
i feel as if i don't understand you at all , and i want so much to understand .
why , mrs brenner?
because my son seems to be very fond of you .
and i don't quite know how i feel about it .
i don't even know if i like you or not .
is that so important , your liking me?
well , yes .
i think so .
mitch is important to me .
i want to like whatever girl he chooses .
and perhaps if you don't?
well , then i don't think it'll matter much to anyone but me .
i think it would also matter to mitch .
mitch has always done exactly what he wanted to do .
but , you see ...
i don't want to be left alone .
i don't think i could bear to be left alone !
oh , forgive me .
oh , forgive me .
this business with the birds has upset me .
i don't know what i'd do if mitch weren't here .
why don't you try to sleep now , mrs brenner?
i wish i were stronger .
do you think she's alright?
do you think she's alright at the school?
would you like me to go for her?
oh , i couldn't ask it .
oh , i don't mind , really .
would you?
i'd feel so much better .
i'll go right now .
melanie?
thanks for the tea .

now , please put your songbooks away , then stand up alongside your desks .
we'll go out for recess as soon as everybody gets ready .
we are not going into the playground
until everybody has quieted down .
close that door .
quickly .
what?
please .
what is it?
look .
we've got to get the children out of here .
shh , shh , shh !
alright , children .
now , quiet .
miss daniels would like to see how we conduct ourselves
during a fire drill .
i would like you to show her how quiet and obedient you can be .
uh , we're going out of school now .
leave school?
we want those of you who live nearby to go directly home .
home?
i want the rest of you to go all the way down to the hotel .
is that clear?
yes , miss hayworth .
melanie?
i want you to go as quietly as possible .
don't make a sound till i tell you to run .
then run as quickly as you can .
now , does everybody understand?
yes , miss hayworth .
alright , john , you lead the way .
cathy !
cathy !
( crying .
birds squawking )
daddy , there were hundreds of them .
no , i'm not hysterical .
i'm trying to tell you this as calmly as i know how .
alright , daddy .
yes , daddy .
well , just now .
not 15 minutes ago .
at the school .
no , i don't .
just a minute .
what's the name of the school?
just the bodega bay school .
the bodega bay school .
well , i don't know how many children 30 or 40 .
no , the birds didn't attack until the children were outside the school .
help you , mrs bundy?
i need some change , mr carter .
crows , i think .
i don't know .
is there a difference between crows and blackbirds?
there is very definitely a difference .
thank you .
they're different , daddy .
well , i think these were crows .
well , yes .
hundreds of them .
yes , they attacked the children .
attacked them !
well , i don't know when , but i simply can't leave now , daddy .
alright .
yes .
good bye .
they're both perching birds , of course .
but quite different species .
the crow is corvus brachyrhynchos , and the blackbird is euphagus cyanocephalos .
thank you .
you have the number at the fawcett farm?
right here in this book , miss .
i can't see that it makes any difference , mrs bundy .
crows or blackbirds , if the school was attacked , that's pretty serious .
i hardly think that either species would have sufficient intelligence to launch a massed attack .
their brainpans are not big enough to ...
i just came from the school .
i don't know anything about their brainpans , but ...
well , i do .
i do know .
ornithology happens to be my avocation .
birds are not aggressive creatures , miss .
they bring beauty into the world .
it is mankind , rather , who  sam !
three southern fried chicken .
baked potato on all of them .
yes , may i speak to mitch brenner , please?
yes , i'll wait .
it is mankind , rather , who insists upon making it difficult for life to exist upon this planet .
now , if it were not for birds  mrs bundy , you don't understand .
this young lady said there was an attack on the school .
impossible !
oh , mitch?
i'm glad i caught you .
something terrible has happened .
it's the end of the world .
two bloody marys , deke .
what actually happened at the school?
bunch of crows attacked the school kids .
it's the end of the world .
thus saith the lord god unto the mountains and the hills , and the rivers and the valleys .
behold i , even i shall bring a sword upon you .
and i will devastate your high places .
ezekiel , chapter six .
" woe unto them that rise up early in the morning , that they may follow strong drink .
isaiah , chapter five .
it's the end of the world .
i hardly think a few birds are going to bring about the end of the world .
these weren't a few birds .
i didn't know there were many crows in bodega bay this time of year .
the crow is a permanent resident throughout its range .
in fact , during our christmas count , we recorded  how many gulls did you count , mrs bundy?
which gulls , mr sholes?
there are several varieties .
the ones who've been playing devil with my fishing boats .
have you had trouble with gulls?
one of my boats did , last week .
this young lady was hit by a gull only saturday .
i'm still waiting for the bloody marys .
coming right up .
could you ask them to lower their voices , please?
they're frightening the children .
a whole flock of gulls nearly capsized one of my boats .
practically tore the skipper's arm off .
you're scaring the kids .
keep it low .
alright .
yeah , but he's scaring me , too .
are you trying to say that all these ...
nah , that sounds impossible , sebastian .
deke , look , i'm just telling you what happened to one of my boats .
the gulls were after your fish .
really , let's be logical about this .
what were the crows after at the school?
what do you think they were after , miss uh ...?
daniels .
i think they were after the children .
for what purpose?
to kill them .
why?
i don't know why .
i thought not .
birds have been on this planet , miss daniels ,
since archaeopteryx , 140m years ago .
doesn't it seem odd that they'd wait all that time to start a war against humanity?
no one called it a war .
scotch , light on the water .
you and mr sholes seem to be implying as much .
who said anything about a war?
all i said , some gulls
want some more coffee?
no ... came down on one of my boats .
they could have been after the fish , just like you said .
the captain should have shot at them .
huh?
gulls are scavengers , anyway .
most birds are .
get yourselves guns and wipe them off the face of the earth !
that would hardly be possible .
why not , mrs bundy?
because there are 8, 650 species of birds in the world today , mr carter .
it is estimated that 5, 750, 000, 000 birds live in the united states alone .
the five continents of the world
kill them all .
get rid of the messy animals . ... probably contain more than 100 billion birds .
it's the end of the world .
the gulls must have been after the fish .
of course !
hurry up , children .
finish your lunch .
are the birds going to eat us , mommy?
hell , maybe we're all getting a little carried away by this .
admittedly , a few birds did act strange , but that's no reason to believe that
i keep telling you , this isn't a few birds .
these are gulls , crows , swifts
i have never known birds of different species to flock together .
the very concept is unimaginable .
why , if that happened , we wouldn't have a chance !
how could we possibly hope to fight them?
we couldn't , you're right .
you're right , mrs bundy .
what's the matter?
something wrong?
we're fighting a war .
a war?
against who?
against birds !
i'm glad you all think this is so amusing .
you've frightened the children half out of their wits .
if the young lady said she saw the attack at a school , why don't you believe her?
what attack?
who attacked the school?
birds did .
crows .
you're all sitting around here debating !
what do you want them to do next?
crash through that window?
mommy !
ssh .
put on your coat .
why don't you all go home , lock your doors and windows?
what's the fastest way to san francisco?
the freeway , ma'am .
how do i find it?
i'm going out that way , lady .
you can follow me .
well then , let's leave now .
haven't finished my drink yet .
i got here as fast as i could .
where's cathy?
she's with annie .
she's alright .
al , why aren't you over at the school , where the attack was?
i just got back from dan fawcett's place .
he was killed last night by birds .
what?
hold it , you don't know that for a fact .
what are the facts?
the santa rosa police think it's a felony murder .
they think a burglar broke in and killed him .
how do they explain the dead birds all over the floor?
santa rosa police figure they got in after the old man was killed .
were the santa rosa police at your school today?
are you coming?
now take it easy , lady .
there isn't a bird anywhere in sight !
look at the birds of the air .
they do not sow or reap .
yet your heavenly father feeds them .
something like this happened in santa cruz last year .
the town was just covered with seagulls .
please finish your drink .
that's right , sir .
i recall it .
a large flock of seagulls got lost in a fog , and headed into the town where all the lights were .
they made some mess , too , smashing into buildings and everything .
they always make a mess .
the point is that no one seemed to be upset about it .
they were all gone next morning , just as though nothing at all had happened .
poor things .
i'm leaving !
are you coming?
alright , alright !
well , hope you folks figure this thing out !
it's the end of the world !
i'd better get back to the cannery .
what do i owe you , deke?
sebastian , hold it a minute .
huh?
i don't want to be an alarmist , but  no one ever said you were .
i think we're in real trouble .
i don't know how this started , or why , but i know it's here and we'd be crazy to ignore it .
to ignore what?
the " bird war "?
yes , the " bird war .
the bird attack , plague call it what you like , they're massing out there someplace , and they'll be back .
ridiculous .
come here .
unless we do something right now , unless we get bodega bay on the move , they
look , mitch .
even if this is true , even if all the birds
don't you believe it's true?
no , mitch , frankly i don't .
there's no reason i ...
it's happening .
isn't that a reason?
i like bodega bay  then help me !
you're an important man .
if you help , they all will .
help how?
what do you want to do?
mrs bundy said something about santa cruz .
about seagulls getting lost in a fog and flying in towards the lights .
we don't have fog this time of year !
make our own fog !
how do you figure to do that?
we can use smoke pots , the way the army uses them .
look !
they're attacking again .
melanie , you stay in here .
come on , al !
look out !
look at the gas .
that man's lighting a cigar !
hey , you !
watch out !
don't drop that match !
get out of there !
mister , run !
( shrieking .
gulls crying , fainter )
why are they doing this?
why are they doing this?
they said when you got here , the whole thing started !
who are you?
what are you?
where did you come from?
i think you're the cause of all this .
i think you're evil !
evil !
oh , god !
( woman sobbing .
door opens & closes )
i think they're going !
we can get cathy at annie's now .
the crows again .
shh !
come on .
oh , no .
stay here .
stay here .
cathy !
where's cathy?
( cawing .
cathy sobbing )
mitch , don't !
oh , don't leave her there , mitch .
oh !
( cawing .
door opening & closing )
come on .
shh .
when we got back from taking michelle home , we heard the explosion and we went we went outside to see what it was .
all at once , the birds were everywhere !
all at once she pushed me inside and they covered her !
annie ... she pushed me inside !
give me another one , darling .
how long have they been gathering there?
oh , about 15 minutes .
seems like a pattern , doesn't it?
they strike , then disappear , and then start massing again .
doesn't look so very different , does it?
a little smoke hanging over the town , otherwise ...
you want to try your father again?
no , i tried a little while ago .
the phone's dead .
still got power , haven't we?
yes .
mitch , i'm getting something on the radio .
come on .
i can't get any of the local stations .
i think this is san francisco .
" ... and the work of a team of professionals .
in bodega bay early this morning , a large flock of crows attacked a group of children who were leaving the school during a fire drill .
one little girl was seriously injured and taken to the hospital in santa rosa , but the majority of children reached safety .
we understand there was another attack on the town , but this information is rather sketchy .
so far , no word has come through to show there have been further attacks .
on the national scene today , in washington
well , is that all?
i'll have to get some more wood .
mustn't let this fire go out .
did you get the windows in the attic?
yes , i got them all .
when do you think they'll come?
i don't know .
if there are bigger birds , mitch , they'll get into the house .
it's a chance we'll have to take .
maybe we ought to leave .
no , not now !
not when they're massing out there .
when?
we'll just see what happens .
where will we go?
i don't know .
i think we're safe here for the time being .
let's get the wood .
what happens when you run out of wood?
i don't know !
we'll break up the furniture .
you don't know !
when will you know?
when we're all dead !
if only your father were here ...
( radio continues .
sobbing )
i'm sorry .
i'm sorry , mitch .
make yourself some coffee , won't you?
where are they heading?
somewhere inland .
santa rosa?
maybe .
come on .
let's get the wood .
mitch?
can i bring the lovebirds in here?
no !
but , mom , they're in a cage .
they're birds , aren't they?
let's leave them in the kitchen , huh , honey?
mitch , why are they doing this , the birds?
we don't know , honey .
why are they trying to kill people?
i wish i could say .
i'm sick , melanie .
i want to ...  i'll go with you .
( door slams .
cathy coughing )
( flapping grows louder .
high pitched chirping )
( shutter scraping shut .
screeching continues )
( pecking , splintering .
continuous screeching )
they're going .
mitch?
( gasps .
wings flapping )
oh , mitch !
get cathy and lydia out of here .
melanie !
melanie !
oh , poor thing !
poor thing !
listen , get some water , bandages and antiseptic .
quickly !
bandages .
it's terrible .
cathy , get some brandy .
no , no , no !
no , no , it's alright .
no , it's alright .
it's alright .
it's alright .
no .
no .
shh !
shh !
cathy , get the lamp .
we've got to get her to a hospital .
we can't .
there's no place we can go .
there's san francisco .
we'd never make it .
we have to try .
we'll go by way of bay hill road .
then we don't have to go through town .
we can't stay here .
she needs help !
i'm frightened .
terribly frightened .
i don't know what's outside there .
we'd better get started before another attack comes .
we'll take melanie's car .
that'll be faster than the truck .
can you finish the bandaging?
i'll try .
alright .
mitch?
see if you can get anything on the car radio .
" the bird attacks have subsided for the time being .
'bodega bay seems to be the centre , though there are reports of minor attacks on sebastopol and a few on santa rosa .
'bodega bay has been cordoned off by roadblocks .
most of the townspeople have managed to get out , but there are still some isolated pockets of people .
no decision has been arrived at yet as to what the next step will be , but there's been some discussion as to whether the military should go in .
it appears that the bird attacks come in waves , with long intervals between .
the reason for this does not seem clear as yet .
did you hear anything on the radio?
it's alright .
come on .
no .
no !
shh .
shh .
mitch?
shh !
stay there .
can i bring the lovebirds , mitch?
they haven't harmed anyone .
alright .
bring them .
