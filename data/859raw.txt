at the end of the world war tomainia weakened ,
revolution had broken out , her diplomats sued for peace while tomainia's army fought on , confident its war machine would smash the enemy's lines ,
big bertha , able to fire 100 miles , was to make its appearance on the western front , and strike terror into the enemy , 75 miles away was her target : the cathedral of notre dame ,
95, 452 .
stand clear !
fire !
stand by your trigger !
95, 455 .
breach secured .
stand clear .
ready ...
fire !
defective shell .
we'll examine it .
check the fuse .
yes , the fuse .
look out !
run !
what's that?
air raid .
after big bertha .
the anti aircraft gun !
to the gun !
have you gone crazy?
come down !
what do you think you're doing?
have you gone crazy?
sir , the enemy have broken through .
every man to the front .
muster the gun crew !
get your hand grenades , soldiers .
where's your hand grenade?
give him one .
keep moving .
come along , hurry up !
pardon me , but to work this ...
pull the pin , count to ten and throw it !
let them have it !
this is no time to scratch .
pull yourself together .
take this .
forward !
fall in !
hey you , come on !
order arms !
prepare to attack .
forward !
there you are .
the enemy !
come on , let's get him !
may i come in , sir?
who is it?
friend .
what division?
21st artillery , sir .
take this and keep firing .
i'll be back .
comrade !
help !
what is it?
i'm exhausted .
quick , help me to my plane .
thank you .
i'll see you get the tomainian cross for this .
only too willing to oblige , sir .
you saved my life .
thank you .
i'll strap you in .
i can't make it alone .
you'll have to stay with me .
can you fly?
i can try .
lift my hand to the stick .
i haven't the strength .
take charge of that gun !
the enemy !
quick , lift my hand to the throttle .
we'll fool 'em !
hold on to these dispatches .
if we get them to general schmelloffel ,
tomainia may yet win .
i'm going to faint .
don't say that .
sorry .
where am i?
don't you know me?
yes , i feel better now .
the blood's returning to my head .
what's below?
the sun?
shining upwards .
strange .
how's the gas?
kept me awake all night .
no , the gasoline in the tank !
almost empty .
we must be nearly there .
what time is it?
approximately one minute to twelve .
strange .
we seem to be defying the laws of gravity .
water .
quick , i'm going to faint .
wait a while .
we'll get into trouble if you faint any more .
just hold it .
i think i ...
now ...
take it !
something's wrong .
i can't reach it .
it's all gone .
what's the matter?
belt too tight .
loosen it .
i'm trying to !
we're upside down .
i know it !
the stick !
impossible .
there it goes .
we're out of gas .
well , i suppose this is the end .
cigarette?
not now !
i shan't need this any more .
what month is it?
april .
spring in tomainia .
hilda will be in the garden , tending the daffodils .
how she loves daffodils !
she'd never cut them for fear of hurting them .
it was like taking a life to cut a daffodil .
sweet , gentle hilda .
a beautiful soul .
she loved animals , and little children , too .
we've landed !
dispatches !
comrade , where are you?
the dispatches ...
where are they?
are you hurt?
take me to general schmelloffel .
if we don't deliver these , we're defeated .
the war's over .
what?
we lost .
hynkel takes power , the jewish soldier suffered a loss of memory and remained in hospital for years , ignorant of the change in tomainia ,
hynkel ruled the nation with an iron fist ,
under the double cross emblem liberty was banished ,
only the voice of hynkel was heard ,
adenoid hynkel said ,
tomainia was down but today has risen ,
democracy is fragrant ,
liberty is odious ,
freedom of speech is objectionable ,
tomainia has the greatest army ,
the greatest navy ,
but to remain great we must sacrifice ,
we must tighten our belts ,
he now speaks to field marshal herring , minister of war ,
now herr garbitsch , minister of the interior ,
he remembers his early struggles , shared by his two loyal comrades ,
a reference to the jewish people ,
the phooey remarks that for the world he has peace in his heart
we now pause for station identification ,
this is the pari mutual network , bringing you
hynkel's address to the children of the double cross ,
the interpreter is hynkel's personal translator , reading from a prepared manuscript ,
stand by for further commentary , go ahead , tomainia ,
his excellency is about to descend the stairs ,
your excellency , are you hurt?
ride in the other car .
his excellency seems pleased as he is greeted by tomainian children ,
he pauses before a woman with a child ,
camera !
even the baby is thrilled and seems all smiles at the attention ,
his excellency leaves the scene and will return along hynkelstrasse , where he'll pass tomainia's modern masterpieces : the venus of today and the thinker of tomorrow ,
how was it?
the speech?
very good .
your reference to the jews might have been more violent .
what?
to arouse the people's anger .
violence against the jews might make the people forget their stomach .
you're right .
things have been quiet in the ghetto lately .
good morning , mr jaeckel .
what's good about it?
conditions could be worse .
if you think so , you have a great imagination .
you heard hynkel's speech .
i heard nothing .
i've got my own troubles .
you're better off than a lot of people .
what about the barber?
still in hospital .
he's been there since the war .
why not rent his barbershop for him?
he won't let me .
every few weeks he writes to say he's coming back .
a pity it should be idle all these years .
why worry?
the government will soon take it from him .
perhaps you're right .
not such a good morning after all .
now you said it .
hannah .
on the mantelpiece is my tobacco pouch .
will you get it?
everyone is full of troubles .
yeah , everyone .
look at hannah , poor girl .
a hard worker , can't get a job .
father was killed in the war , mother died last year .
can't earn enough to pay her rent .
what can i do?
i can't throw her out .
you need some more .
where are you going?
mrs shoemaker's laundry .
you'd better take the key .
mrs jaeckel and i are going out .
i'm locking up in case the storm troopers start their monkey business again .
aryan !
we're aryans !
and we go marching by !
look , fellows !
tomatoes and potatoes .
i'll take a box home .
hey , the lorry .
hold it there , will you?
you have no right !
just charge it to my account !
nice ripe tomatoes .
why don't some of you do something?
if i were a man i'd show you .
what would you do , pretty?
not one of you has the guts to stand up alone and fight !
is the lorry in case someone hits back?
shut up !
come and take me .
you'll get medals for it .
you pick on women and rob defenceless people .
don't rob the poor girl , boys .
give her back her tomatoes .
i'll have to do it again .
pigs !
patient 33 !
yes , sir ,
an interesting case : amnesia .
jewish soldier .
been here since the war .
he thinks it's only been weeks .
does he knows what's happened?
no .
his one interest seems to be in his barbershop , which he believes he left a few weeks ago .
he'll have many surprises .
i'm afraid so .
yes?
number 33 is gone ,
he was to be examined .
but he's disappeared ,
disappeared?
let him go .
it isn't a serious case .
there's little we can do for him .
come on , get out of here !
what are you doing?
i don't know .
leave that alone .
don't be silly .
i'm not silly !
i appreciate that .
when you talk to me , " hail hynkel " !
who are you?
i'll show you who i am !
come down to headquarters !
that's my shop .
i don't care if it is or not .
going to put up a fight , are you?
come to headquarters .
let me tell you something .
policeman?
arrest that man for assault .
come here , you !
leave me alone .
attacking a storm trooper !
you'll hear from my lawyer .
he bit my finger !
sorry , i didn't mean to hit you .
i enjoyed that .
but you'd better beat it .
i'll call a policeman .
no !
why not?
are you crazy?
more are coming !
more what?
wait !
come in here .
what's wrong with you?
don't be foolhardy .
what's this?
who hit you?
i think it was a gang .
you'd better get fixed up .
we'll investigate later .
what time is it?
all right , they've gone .
thanks , mister .
that did me a lot of good .
you've sure got some nerve .
we should all fight back .
we can't fight alone , but we can lick 'em together .
we didn't do so bad .
you're the barber , who was in hospital !
mr jaeckel has talked about you .
we didn't think you'd come back .
the storm troopers will be after you .
you'd better hide .
i'll get the key to the cellar .
is this the man?
that's him .
hail hynkel !
who's he?
don't fool with me .
hail hynkel !
your hands .
just a moment .
not here .
bring him outside .
first you'll finish this .
here .
go on , paint that !
wait a minute , boys .
i've got a bright idea .
commander schultz !
first in command .
second in command .
oh , never mind .
you !
who told you to hang people from lampposts?
what was the trouble?
a jew attacking storm troopers .
where is he?
there .
break ranks .
so there you are .
stand him up .
get up .
you?
don't you remember me?
you saved my life .
me?
strange .
and i always thought of you as an aryan .
i'm a vegetarian .
don't you remember?
we got away in my plane .
plane?
then we crashed .
now i remember .
well , how are you?
what's my friend done?
he resisted my men painting his windows .
any brave man would resist .
i'm sorry for this .
no harm .
in future you will not be molested again .
if you or your friends ever need help ...
who did that?
one of my friends .
hynkel's palace was the centre of the world's greatest war machine ,
behind it was the dynamic adenoid hynkel , whose genius ran the nation , whose ceaseless activity kept him occupied every moment of the day ,
marshal herring is waiting ,
enough !
i believe we've got something now .
a bulletproof uniform .
the material is as light as silk .
where?
i've arranged for a demonstration .
it will only take two minutes .
i can spare one .
professor herr kibitzen .
actions speak louder than words .
a bulletproof uniform .
one hundred percent perfect .
shoot !
far from perfect .
where's my secretary?
in the outer office .
call her .
take a letter .
herring here in the tower room , we've got something marvellous ,
i shall be up .
a parachute .
the most compact in the world .
worn like a hat .
it will open in 25 feet .
demonstrate , professor .
herring , why do you waste my time like this?
send garbitsch here .
herr garbitsch is waiting ,
enough !
what's the meaning of this?
25 million for prison camps?
we need to manufacture munitions .
we've made a few arrests .
how many?
five or ten thousand ... a day .
a day?
just a few dissenters .
dissenting about?
working hours , wage cuts , the synthetic food , the quality of the sawdust in the bread .
what more do they want?
it's from the finest lumber !
nevertheless , the people are overworked .
they need diversion .
the people , bah !
we might go further with the jews .
burn some of their houses .
an assault on the ghetto .
something more dramatic .
when can we be ready to invade osterlich?
three months .
i can't wait .
napaloni's army might invade first .
we must strike now .
we'll require foreign capital .
borrow it !
the bankers have refused .
epstein .
epstein?
he's a jew , isn't he?
yes .
well , let's be big about it .
we'll borrow from epstein .
it might be difficult in view of our policy towards his people .
then we'll change our policy .
tell schultz all persecution of the jews must cease .
at least till we've negotiated this loan .
i don't understand it .
the whole ghetto is so quiet .
you can't imagine what was going on .
this hynkel business .
you weren't here , you were in the hospital , unconscious .
you don't appreciate what a good time you were having .
if things get worse we can go to osterlich .
that's still free .
sooner or later we'll have to go .
anyway , it's nice to see you back .
it's like the old days again , eh?
how's business?
very slow .
the men are in concentration camp .
you should fix up the women .
the beauty parlour business .
know anything about it?
you can learn .
you can practise on hannah .
hannah , get in that chair , we'll make you look beautiful .
what for?
he's going to practise on you .
not with mud on my face?
no , we'll take some off .
make me look beautiful?
sure .
he can't make you look any worse !
mrs shoemaker's laundry !
i'll give it to her .
you sit here and enjoy yourself .
i know .
i've seen you making eyes .
don't pay any attention to him .
i like your shop since it's fixed up .
i wish i had a business like this .
there's no future in housework .
maybe if i save my money i can have a barbershop some day .
but i can never save .
money slips through my fingers .
i've always lived up to every penny i've earned .
why shouldn't i?
you're here today and gone tomorrow .
do you believe in god?
i do .
but if there wasn't one , would you live any different?
i wouldn't .
life could be wonderful if people'd leave you alone .
things are looking brighter now .
maybe because of you saving schultz .
funny how they've left us alone .
too good to be true .
do you ever daydream?
i do .
that's the only time i'm really happy : dreaming .
sometimes i get so carried away i don't know what i'm doing .
aren't you like that?
we're very much alike .
both absent minded .
you think so?
i like absent minded people .
like the man who put his watch in boiling water and held the egg !
all great men are absent minded .
it's a sign you're smart .
my folks didn't think so .
you have an excuse .
you were injured in the war .
i was born that way .
i wonder why women never grow whiskers .
isn't that foolish of me?
i could kick myself in the shins , i could ...
i'll give you a shampoo .
ain't i cute?
how did you do it?
you should try it on yourself .
fixed up , you'd look handsome .
four pecks a pound , new potatoes !
the potato man !
i have to go .
take it easy there .
did you hurt yourself?
careful next time .
here's another one .
how do you do?
something's happened .
the storm troopers helped me up .
how wonderful if they stopped hating us , if they let us go about our business like we used to .
how wonderful if we didn't have to go to another country .
i don't want to go .
with all the persecution , i still love it here .
perhaps we don't have to go .
wouldn't it be wonderful if they'd let us live and be happy again?
full stop .
nothing works !
not even a sharp pencil .
i'm surrounded by incompetent , stupid , sterile stenographers .
i'll get you a pen .
don't bother !
i won't send it .
get out , get out !
we've just discovered the most wonderful poison gas .
it will kill everybody ...
all right .
later .
b76 to see herr herring ,
a lady .
my secret agent .
your secret agent?
tell her to come here .
have b76 come right in .
any news from epstein?
our agent reports that all the board of directors are aryans .
the loan's bound to go through .
good .
a strike at the arms factory .
the leader?
five of them .
have them shot .
they were .
how many were going to strike?
three thousand of them .
have them all shot .
i don't want dissatisfied workers .
these men are skilled craftsmen .
let's train others first , then shoot them !
cannot afford to be lenient .
the rhythm of production will be affected .
rhythm ...
all right , have your rhythm .
spare the strikers and permit them to return to work .
but mark them for future reference .
that's my department .
i'll attend to that .
this way .
the strike leaders are all brunettes .
not one blond .
troublemakers !
worse than jews .
then wipe them out !
" doucement " .
we'll get rid of the jews first , then concentrate on the brunettes .
we shall never have peace till we have a pure aryan race .
how wonderful !
tomainia , a nation of blue eyed blonds .
why not a blond europe , asia , america?
and a brunette dictator .
of the world !
why not?
aut caesar aut nullus .
the world's effete , worn out , afraid .
no nation would dare oppose you .
dictator of the world !
it's your destiny .
we'll kill off the jews , wipe out the brunettes , then will come forth a pure aryan race .
beautiful blond aryans .
they will love you , they will worship you as a god .
no , you mustn't say it .
you make me afraid of myself .
dictator of the world !
we'll invade osterlich first .
after that we can bluff .
the nations will capitulate .
the world will be under your thumb .
leave me !
i want to be alone .
aut caesar aut nullus ,
emperor of the world !
my world .
the happy hour programme ,
work with the rhythm of music ,
brahms 'hungarian dance number five ,
fifteen cents , please .
happy hour signing off ,
at six , adenoid hynkel will address the children of the double cross ,
it seems like the old days again .
how long is it going to last?
in the papers it's rumoured that hynkel's going to give the jews back their rights .
maybe .
what do you want?
business is much better .
nobody interferes with us any more .
doesn't that make you feel good?
the trouble , mr jaeckel , is you're so used to bad times , you're unhappy without them .
get my sunday shoes .
they're on the windowsill .
i can't find the shawl .
i've got a shawl .
what's going on?
they're dressing hannah up to go out .
is that so?
she's got a beau .
who is it?
the barber .
now , turn around .
my dear !
those hands !
what's the matter with them?
those calluses .
they're so rough .
maybe i better not go .
don't be foolish .
he knows you do housework .
wait !
i'll get a pair of mittens .
see if he's ready .
not yet .
he's polishing a bald man's head .
bad news .
the invasion of osterlich will have to be delayed .
what?
epstein refuses to lend the money .
epstein refuses , eh?
send for schultz .
epstein refuses .
what did he say?
he complained of the persecution and said he wouldn't have any dealings with a mediaeval maniac .
he'll deal with a mediaeval maniac more than he thinks !
first i shall deal with his people .
your excellency?
call out the storm troopers .
a little mediaeval entertainment in the ghetto !
at such a time i think it ill advised .
such demonstrations demoralise the country .
indeed?
since when do you care about the ghetto?
i speak in the interests of our party and the cause of humanity .
you need a holiday .
fresh air .
a little outdoor exercise .
i'll send you to a concentration camp .
place schultz under arrest .
very well , but remember my words .
your cause is doomed to failure because it is built on the stupid persecution of innocent people .
your policy is worse than a crime .
it's a tragic blunder .
traitor !
traitor !
you're a double dyed democrat !
schultz , why have you forsaken me?
excellency , here are the notes for your speech .
i'll not need them .
