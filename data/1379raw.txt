no way they're going to bring those automated vacuum loaders here .
when they installed them on 1 4 and 23 , they said it was a temporary experiment .
well , they're still there .
some temporary !
hand me that coupler , would you?
what about wooton?
he's a shop steward .
what'd he say?
i'll tell you what wooton said .
zip .
that's what he said .
they're always trying to pull something .
that's a lot of crap !
they've run a 7 worker shift since they installed those loaders on 1 4 and 23 .
hey , you read the contract .
8 workers per shift .
that's what it says .
eight .
in black and white .
so they want to get cute , i can get cute , too .
i want a meeting .
maybe we need a new shop steward .
bylaws are bylaws .
can't they regulate these suits?
it's minus 1 75 degrees .
we broil our asses off .
where's your other suit?
in the shop .
put some mylar over the sensor .
it steps down the heating coil and you'll be cooler .
really?
no , moron , i made it up .
oh , god !
i hate spiders !
kill it !
kill it !
hey , tarlow , what's eating you?
get it off !
get it off my leg !
somebody please help me !
tarlow , what's the matter with you?
get what off?
spider !
please help me !
get it off !
spider?
have you popped your cork?
how can there be a spider here?
there's nothing alive here .
get it off !
oh , get it off !
oh , god !
very funny .
we're not falling for nothing .
cut the garbage and get back to work .
oh , god , it's getting inside !
get it out !
get it out !
somebody please help me !
somebody help me get it out of my suit !
is it the buttermilk kind?
i'm afraid so .
they were running out of the other kind .
i can hardly talk with these braces .
it won't be much longer .
how much longer?
pretty soon .
how soon?
how soon for what?
till i get my braces off .
you want crooked teeth?
i don't mind them .
you'll be missing some teeth in a minute if you don't eat breakfast .
pretend it's not buttermilk .
pretend i ate them .
marshal , it's lowell .
the night watch went okay .
nothing much .
just a couple of drunks .
we'll watch it tonight .
that's it .
i'll be in your office at 18 : 00 .
marshal , it's montone .
nothing more on that incident ... ... in the mine yesterday .
some guy went whacko .
the company's shipping the body back , or what's left , on today's shuttle .
it's impossible to do an autopsy .
you should have seen that mess !
anyway , definitely no homicide .
there were two witnesses when it happened .
it happens every once in a while up here .
some people let this place get to them .
so , that's about it .
tell your wife that transportation got the tickets for her .
i'll see you when you get to the office .
and don 't worry , you'll get used to it .
what tickets?
mr. and mrs. reynolds , the nice couple from the bakery .
they wanted tickets for the weekly shuttle for a friend .
so i said i'd see what i could do .
well , i'd better go .
see you for dinner , sport .
and remember , 7 pages of math .
i promise .
you be good today .
i will .
look , i know this is a lousy assignment .
and i know what it is for you .
how difficult .
just give it a chance .
it won't be so bad .
i know .
i love you .
i love you , too .
we've only been here two weeks .
it'll get better .
i promise .
i got to go .
you smell good .
and finally , i realize that i'm new here . . . . . . and i've got to get to know you , and you've got to get to know me .
i just hope that i can justify your confidence .
thank you .
i really wowed them .
had them eating out of your hand .
are there any questions?
marshal?
flo spector . . . . . . accounting services .
i'm sure i speak for all of us . . . . . . in extending our welcome to you and your family .
if mrs. o'niel or your son should need anything , tell them to call me .
thank you very much .
i'll be sure and tell my wife .
her name is carol .
i see there are no more questions .
i add my welcome to marshal o'niel .
i'm sure we all agree he'll have a pleasant tour .
right now , he's just getting started here .
soon he'll see that this is like every other mining town .
there's never much trouble .
i'm glad to hear it .
just remember that these men and women work hard .
very hard .
since i've been the general manager , we've broken all productivity records .
we're becoming the leading con amalgamate operation .
and everyone in this room has received the bonus checks to prove it .
good work only comes from contented people .
i work these people hard . . . . . . and i let them play hard .
when it comes time for them to let off steam . . . . . . you have to allow them some room .
long as no harm's done , just give them a little room .
understand what i'm saying , marshal?
thanks for the advice , mr. sheppard .
we're all professionals .
i'm sure we are .
drop by my office .
we'll talk some more .
i'll do that .
don't get your nose out of joint .
what was that all about?
it's just his way .
i don't like his way .
don't mess with him .
he's an asshole .
a very powerful asshole .
don't mess with him .
he's just trying to sniff you out .
the last marshal kept things running smooth .
that's all they want .
things run smooth , they make their money .
nobody's here for their health , and they certainly aren't here for the scenery .
what is that guy doing?
he's going in the elevator !
he's going in the elevator without a suit on !
carol?
i'm trying to keep my composure .
and like everything i do , i think i'm messing this up .
i despise these message things .
i'm just such a coward .
i couldn 't look at your face and say what i'm about to say .
i just couldn 't .
if you were in front of me , i'd change my mind .
and i don 't want to change my mind .
i love you .
please know that .
i hadn 't planned this .
i really hadn 't .
i just can 't take it anymore .
that's what it amounts to .
i know we've been over this so many times before .
the same crying from me , and the same assurances from you .
that the next place will be different .
but it never is .
it can 't be .
so yesterday , something snapped in me .
i just couldn 't bear to see paulie ... ... clatter around yet another bleak place .
i just couldn 't .
he's a child .
he's never set foot on earth .
never !
he looks at pictures and reads books of earth ... ... all day long .
and he hides them from you so your feelings won 't be hurt .
don 't you see he deserves a childhood?
he deserves a chance to breathe air , real outside air ... ... where you don 't broil or explode .
air that smells like life !
not like a ventilating unit !
i'm just not as good as you are .
i don 't think it's worth it .
so i'm taking paulie back home .
i love you .
you don 't deserve this .
you deserve the best .
i've just got to go now , my love .
i'll contact you ... ... in a few days from the space station before we finally leave for earth .
what do we have here?
what's happening with the purser's area?
we've put monitors on the whole area for 36 hours . . . . . . and things have been quiet .
keep the monitors on for two weeks .
and the detonators?
they were found .
where?
i don't know .
the foreman reported them found . . . . . . then told me to forget about it .
nelson , we're talking about nuclear detonators .
you just don't lose them and then find them .
you lose your comb , then find it .
not detonators .
i want to know where they were found and who found them .
get it?
good for you , nelson .
slater , what about the incident in the mine elevator?
nothing much to tell , sarge .
some cupcake named cane decided he didn't need an environment suit .
they're still sponging him off the elevator walls .
he was alone .
nobody near enough to have thrown him in .
some guys tried to get into the airlock . . . . . . except he'd sealed it .
no way it was homicide .
had to have been a suicide .
did he leave a note?
i beg your pardon?
did he leave a note?
none that we know of , sir .
then how do you know it was suicide?
there's no other explanation .
he knew what he was doing , that's for sure .
you can't fall into an airlock and then an elevator .
you have to open hatches , press buttons , close hatches .
it's the only explanation .
thank you .
okay .
fanning .
what about the pump station?
just a fight .
we took them both in to cool off .
they straightened out soon .
gil?
pretty quiet .
couple of calls about noise .
nothing much .
who ordered all these pressure packs?
this is a mine , not a war .
you did , doctor .
i said 1 00 .
not 1 , 000 .
i said 1 00 , which can't be mistaken for anything except 1 00 .
it doesn't sound remotely iike 1 , 000 .
listen !
you'll hear what i mean .
one thousand .
one hundred .
totally different .
you think they sound the same?
who are you , anyway?
are you dr. lazarus?
two aspirins and call me in the morning .
doctor joke .
are you the new marshal?
yes .
i'd like to talk to you .
i got an alibi .
four people will swear we were playing poker .
i never heard that one before .
that's really funny .
sorry .
yesterday , a man went into the atmosphere without his pressure suit .
a couple of days before , another man cut his suit open on purpose .
it happens here .
how often?
i don't know .
it just happens here .
why?
i'm not a psychiatrist .
i can't tell you why .
some people can't take it here after awhile .
did you do autopsies?
no .
why not?
the company wanted the bodies shipped out quickly .
secondly , when one exposes himself to zero pressure atmosphere . . . . . . there isn't a lot to inspect .
in the third place , you're becoming a nuisance .
yes , i know .
give me a report of all of the incidents happening over the past 6 months .
i'd like it soon , or i might just kick your nasty ass all over this floor .
that's a marshal joke .
it's open .
i didn't know what you'd like to eat , so i brought everything .
listen , you got to eat something .
can't catch crooks on an empty stomach .
i know how you feel .
i do .
the second time i did a tour , my wife had skipped off . . . . . . with some computer programmer .
i have two daughters .
they call the programmer daddy .
my wife said she was happy .
i said , " happy?
the guy looks so boring .
she said he was not mr. excitement , but he was always home .
you can't argue with that .
try the food , it's not bad .
i will .
the hookers are nice .
they can help when you're lonely .
i'm sure .
i get the feeling i'm bombing .
no , you're not .
i appreciate what you're doing .
i really do .
no , it's just . . .
. . . i'd like to be on my own for now .
i understand .
marshal . . . . . . if you need anything . . . . . . if you just want to talk . . .
. . . please call me .
we've got a response on your request .
i'm trying to keep my composure ... ... and like everything else i do , i think i'm messing this up .
i despise these message things .
i'm just such a coward .
i couldn 't look at your face and say what i'm about to say .
i just couldn 't .
if you were in front of me , i'd change my mind .
what?
how bad?
i'll be right there .
marshal , he's in the west wing .
sergeant montone is waiting for you .
he's in a leisure compartment roughing up a hooker .
she pushed the alarm .
when i responded , he said he had a knife and would kill her if i didn't leave .
a crane operator named sagan .
been here 1 1 months , never caused trouble .
how's the girl?
she's still alive .
is he stoned?
beats me .
some guys like to slap hookers around .
this is marshal o'niel .
let that girl out and no one's going to hurt you .
now listen to me !
just listen .
i can't go away and you know that .
now nobody's going to hurt you .
if you want to talk , we'll talk .
i won't try to break in . . . . . . and you don't do anything crazy with that girl .
okay?
go away !
get me a maintenance worker .
yes , sir .
which vent leads to the air conditioning duct for number two compartment?
open it .
open the hydraulic valves to release the door locks when i tell you .
sagan , can you hear me?
i hear you !
i'll explain this to you . . . . . . very carefully .
i will release the hydraulic pressure on the door locks .
it will open this door .
you cannot keep the doors closed . . . . . . and stay in .
why don't you just come out and make it easy?
the second that door opens , i'll kill her !
i'm going to slice her !
i hate her !
i won't argue with you .
and i won't trick you .
i'm going to count down from ten to one .
at one , the door will spring open slowly .
i will not rush in .
i will not shoot you .
i don't want to hurt anybody , including you .
whatever the problem is . . . . . . we can work it out , without hurting anybody .
you're going to kill me .
no , i'm not .
you have my word .
you also have my word that if you kill that girl . . . . . . i will kill you .
now i'm going to count down from ten . . . . . . to one , slowly .
just do as i say .
ten . . .
. . . nine . . .
well , he turned .
i saw the knife .
jaw looks broken .
maybe the nose .
contusions .
neck wounds look superficial .
jesus christ , who did this to her?
a worker .
went nuts .
it happens here , remember?
i got that list .
she's bleeding in the abdomen .
why didn't you bring it to my office?
i don't make house calls .
she'll be all right?
maybe , if you let me do my job .
28 in the last 6 months .
i wonder in the 6 months before .
24 .
i've got initiative .
good for you .
you want to know how many in the 6 months before that?
two .
are you sure?
i'm unpleasant , not stupid .
of course i'm sure , i can count .
well , what do you think?
i don't know .
almost nobody has both oars in the water , as far as i'm concerned .
why people start to lose their marbles in greater numbers isn't so mystifying .
i don't know why more of them didn't do it sooner .
where are the bodies sent?
they usually ship them out on the next shuttle .
they wrap them up and jettison them halfway to the station .
burial at sea and all that crap .
lazarus?
this is o 'niel .
i'll see you in the hospital right away .
do you know what time it is?
you'd better be dying .
is this going to take long?
you're kidding me .
that doesn't mean much .
blood type , cholesterol count .
this blood is from a dead person .
very good .
no alcohol .
he ate dinner .
protein , carbohydrates . . . . . . more carbohydrates .
he didn't eat his vegetables .
no nicotine .
some tranquilizers .
yeah , they're company tranquilizers .
standard issue .
blood sugar and hemoglobin are normal .
hello .
what?
i don't know .
shit .
such a smart piece of equipment , and a wreck like me trying to run it .
you know , you haven't your medical all star here .
company doctors are like ships 'doctors .
most are one shuttle flight ahead of a malpractice suit .
something's there , isn't it?
maybe .
i spend my days dispensing tranquilizers to the workers . . . . . . and certifying that the prostitutes don't have syphilis .
i don't know how to analyze a new molecule .
hello .
is it a drug?
you just won a prize .
it's some kind of narcotic .
nothing i've ever seen before .
synthetic .
bingo .
polydichloric euthimal .
those stupid bastards are taking polydichloric euthimal !
it's an amphetamine .
strongest thing you ever saw .
makes you feel wonderful .
you do 1 4 hours of work in 6 hours .
that kind of nonsense .
especially manual labor .
it makes you work like a horse .
the army tested it a few years ago .
it made everybody work all right .
then it made them psychotic .
it takes a while , ten , maybe eleven months .
and then it fries your brain .
you said it's synthetic .
can it be made here?
no .
impossible .
it has to have been shipped in .
no autopsies .
so nobody knows anything .
the workers are producing more , so the company's making bigger profits .
they're not about to ask any questions .
it's quite a setup .
don't say anything to anybody about this .
i did good , didn't i?
for a wreck .
you did good .
9 7 .
do you want to tell me about it?
tell you about what?
sheppard .
what about him?
how deep are you in?
not too deep .
i'm paid to look the other way .
you don't do anything bad , you just don't do anything good .
i'm going to bust sheppard .
are you serious?
this is no place for heroes .
you try to bust him . . . . . . you're messing with more than you think .
you're talking about the general manager .
he's a real hotshot here .
it's big money , people and places that we only know from letterheads .
this guy is connected with more than just the company .
i mean it .
there's some serious stuff involved .
what will this prove?
i'm not trying to prove anything .
that stuff they sell is killing people .
what will you do with me?
i don't know .
you want me to resign?
no .
just don't come between sheppard and me .
just keep taking your money . . . . . . and looking the other way .
i don't want you .
i want him .
your serve .
think it over .
he's in cell 36 .
has he said anything?
not a peep .
anyone ask about him?
if anyone does , i want to know .
this is o'niel .
the report says you were carrying 4 ounces of euthimal . . .
. . . which is 400 doses .
i don't know what you're talking about .
of course you don't .
how much does sheppard pay you?
i don't know what you're talking about .
you'll love it here , though some start to go crazy at night . . . . . . when you can't feel the floor .
and sometimes the air tether gets knotted and a man suffocates .
but that doesn't happen too often .
o'niel , piss off !
i like that .
you're real quick with a comeback .
i've got you nailed .
i've got witnesses and evidence .
you'll be shipped back and do time that will make this place look like a picnic !
now don't do a deal with me .
don't get yourself a reduced sentence .
just do your hard time while sheppard laughs his ass off .
i've got to hand it to you .
you're pretty sharp .
see you around , tough guy .
nobody talks to him .
nobody touches him .
i mean nobody , you understand?
i understand .
you know something?
i can hit a seven iron 500 yards in this place .
fix yourself a drink .
no , thanks .
you've been busy .
so have you .
how much do you want?
how much?
just what we need here , a goddamn hero .
you know something?
this rug has a slight break to the left .
let me tell you what you're dealing with .
i run a franchise .
i'm hired to dig as much ore as possible out of this hellhole .
there's a guy like me on every mining operation all over this system .
my hookers are clean , some good looking .
my booze isn't watered .
the workers are happy .
when the workers are happy , they dig more ore .
they get more bonus money .
when they dig more ore , the company's happy .
when the company's happy , i'm happy .
sounds wonderful .
nothing here is wonderful .
it works .
that's enough .
now every year a new marshal comes to start his tour .
they all know the score .
you know the score .
you're no different .
if this hero routine is to get your price up , i'll think about it .
what are you after?
you .
what is it with guys like you?
if you were such a goddamn super cop . . . . . . what are you doing on a company mining operating like io?
they didn't send you here as a reward for your sterling service .
you know that and i know that .
i read your record .
you've got a big mouth .
that's why you're sent from one toilet to the next .
me?
i don't plan on spending the rest of my life doing this .
well , good for you .
now , look , this charade of yours is silly .
you meddle , i want you to know what you're meddling with .
you got something to prove , prove it to yourself , not to me .
i'll see you around .
if you're looking for money , you're smarter than you look !
if you're not , you're a lot dumber .
i'm probably a lot dumber .
that can be very dangerous .
all right , tough guy , time to talk .
what's the matter?
sun in your eyes?
well , well , well , if it isn't the law !
sheppard , guess what i just found in a meat locker?
you know , i have a feeling that you'll tell me even if i don't guess .
250 pounds of hamburger named yario that works for you .
i also found your shipment of pde .
i threw the hamburger in jail and the pde in the toilet .
or the other way around?
i can't remember .
you've been busy .
yeah , are you proud of me?
real proud .
good shot .
you destroyed the shipment?
you do have a flair for the dramatic .
was it expensive?
more than you can ever imagine .
you could be out of business .
you know , i've misjudged you .
you're not stupid .
you're crazy .
you think you caused an inconvenience?
is that what you think?
why don't you go home and polish your badge?
you're dealing with grownups here .
you're out of your league .
whoever sent that shipment will be mad that you lost it .
grownups have no sense of humor .
i'd play a firm eight iron there .
just swing easy .
you're dead .
do you hear me?
i hear you .
bello ws , this is sheppard .
what the hell's been going on down there?
just a little trouble .
i can take care of it .
send me a few of your best men .
and the two you had?
send me the men !
i'll straighten everything out .
my people are not going to like this .
i'll have it straightened out .
when do you need the men?
on the next shuttle .
i'll see what i can do .
i'll call you back later .
what have we got?
break in at the women's quarters .
can't tell if it was a pervert or a burglary .
the guy was surprised and ran like hell .
any prints?
nothing clear .
what else?
not much .
a hell of a fight in the cafeteria .
a broken nose and teeth was the damage .
both guys are cooling out in the tank .
where's your sergeant stripes?
well , it's only been a couple of days since sergeant montone
you're the new sergeant .
you wear your stripes .
put them on now .
this is bello ws .
you've got the men you want and it wasn 't easy .
my people are very unhappy .
this could cause trouble for us on the other operations .
if the company got wind of what's going on , they'd clamp down like a vise .
they can 't afford to lose their franchise .
it could put my people out of business .
and my people like being in business .
tell them not to worry .
how good are the men?
the best .
they've left on the shuttle arriving sunday .
they have their own weapons?
yes .
the target is o 'niel .
you better not mess this up !
i won 't .
it's your party .
yes , it is .
how much help will he have?
none .
you sure?
yes , i'm sure .
no one here will stick their neck out for anyone .
once word spreads that these guys are pros ... ... there'll be no trouble .
i've got someone on the inside who 'll spread the word .
don 't worry .
he's a dead man .
i'll tell you , if this doesn 't work out ... ... the next guys who come will be coming for you .
no sweat .
i'll call you when it's over .
how many can i count on?
well , i don't know , sir .
what about you?
well , you see . . .
. . . most of us are . . .
. . . most are young .
we have families .
i have a family .
i know where we stand .
thank you , sergeant .
that's pretty good .
playing by yourself and losing .
i'd join you in this dumb game if i could play sitting down .
yes , i'm well , thank you .
pretty busy .
seems there's some flu going around .
you'd be surprised how many workers will be sick this sunday .
it's your actual epidemic .
are you going to be sick this sunday?
if you want sterling character , you're in the wrong place .
if you're the guy you're supposed to be , you wouldn't stick around .
that's why they sent you .
maybe they made a mistake .
i was afraid you'd say something like that .
you really think you're making a difference?
then why , for god's sake?
because . . .
. . . maybe they are right .
they send me here to this pile of shit because they think i belong here .
i want to find out . . .
. . . if they're right .
a whole machine works because everybody does what they're supposed to .
and i found out . . . . . . i was supposed to be something i didn't like .
that's what's in the program .
that's my rotten little part , in the rotten machine .
i don't like it .
so i'm going to find out if they're right .
your wife is one stupid lady .
you want to go get drunk?
at least you have some sense left .
hello , there .
i'm doing it again .
i've had so much time to prepare what to say ... ... and here i am looking at your face , and my mouth has gone to mush .
how's paul?
he's fine .
i promised him ... ... he could talk to you .
he's in the next room .
are you well?
i'm okay .
paulie and i ....
the reservations have come through .
we're flying home .
the reservations are for three .
that was thoughtful .
i can't .
why?
i just can't .
i wish i could .
what is so important?
i'm too tired to try to explain .
you're making a difference?
do you think what you're doing is worth giving up your family for?
you're a stubborn son of a bitch .
something's wrong there , isn 't it?
no .
i know you're in some kind of trouble .
when you speak in sentences ... ... of less than two words , you're in trouble .
i know it .
i'm okay .
damn you .
take care of yourself .
you can come in now , paulie .
i love you .
hi , paul .
how are you doing?
great !
mommy let me stay up late because this is when the call came through .
i miss you .
i miss you , too .
mommy says as soon as you get done , you'll come home with us .
as soon as i get done .
what's it like on earth?
it's beautiful .
you're going to see many wonderful things .
and you'll have friends to play with .
mommy says that on the flight , they put you to sleep for more than a year .
that's true .
will it hurt?
not a bit .

i went to your office to offer help .
i saw you on the screen .
you're heading right for them .
you're in terrific shape .
they've missed the artery .
i'll stop the bleeding .
which way were they heading?
they were going to the operations wing .
they're trying to cut you off .
could you seal off the access ways in the east quadrant?
i'll go out around them .

in a mining town ... ... on the second moon of jupiter ... ... something deadly is happening .
pretty soon you'll see that this is just like every other mining town .
i work these people hard . . .
. . . and i let them play hard .
there's never much trouble .
we're all professionals .
i'm sure we are .
we've only been here 2 weeks .
it'll get better .
i promise .
nothing more on that mine incident .
it looks like some guy just went wacko .
it happens here .
how often?
i don't know .
it just happens here .
why?
i'm not a psychiatrist .
i can't tell you why .
some people can't take it here after awhile .
what's that guy think he's doing?
no way it could've been homicide .
had to have been a suicide .
28 in the last six months .
did you do autopsies?
no .
then how do you know that it was a suicide?
there's no other explanation .
when one is exposed to zero pressure , there isn't a whole lot left to inspect .
something's there , isn't it?
maybe .
try and meddle , i want you to know what you're meddling with .
you're out of your league .
you know , we're grownups here .
bingo .
marshal . . . . . . you're dead .
if you're the kind of guy you're supposed to be . . .
. . . you wouldn't stick around .
that's why they sent you here .
maybe they made a mistake .
outland .
the ultimate enemy is still . .. ... man .
