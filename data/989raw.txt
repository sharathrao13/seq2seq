when the value of the x coordinate is equal to or less than the value of ...
yes , isaac?
what about that problem?
why?
i just put that up there as a joke .
that's probably the hardest geometry equation in the world
how much extra credit is it worth?
well , i've never seen anyone get it right including my mentor , dr. leaky at mlt .
i guess if anyone here can solve that problem
i'd see to it that none of you ever have to open another math book again for the rest of your lives .
max?
you want to try it?
i'm sorry .
did someone say my name?
you got it
you guys have it real easy .
i never had it like this where i grew up
but i send my kids here .
because the fact is you go to one of the best schools in the country
rushmore
now , for some of you it doesn't matter .
you were born rich , and you're going to stay rich
but here's my advice to the rest of you
take dead aim on the rich boys .
get them in the crosshairs
and take them down
just remember .
they can buy anything .
but they can't buy backbone .
don't let them forget that .
thank you .
are you free for graduation , herman?
maybe you could give us an encore .
i don't give a shit .
i paid for the whole damn natatorium .
the least these little pricks can do is hear me out .
hello , i'm max fischer .
i just wanted to tell you i strongly agree with your views concerning rushmore .
your speech was excellent
this is my chapel partner , dirk calloway
i really think you're right about rushmore .
what's his name again?
max fisher
he's a sharp little guy
he's one of the worst students we've got
we're putting you on what we call sudden death academic probation
and what does that entail?
it entails that if you fail another class you are going to be asked to leave rushmore .
in other words , i'll be expelled .
that's correct
can i see some documentation?
too many extra curricular activities , max
i don't want to tell you how to do your job but the fact is no matter how hard i try , i still might flunk another class
and if that means i have to stay on for a post graduate year , then so be it .
we don't offer a post graduate year .
we don't offer it yet .
just bring up the grades
do you remember how i got into this school?
yes , you wrote a play
that's right .
second grade .
a little one act about watergate
and my mother read it and felt i should go to rushmore .
you read it and you gave me a scholarship , didn't you?
do you regret it?
no , i don't regret it
but i still might have to expel you
couldn't we just let me float by?
for old times 'sake?
i can't do it , max .
they want to kick me out oh , no .
not again .
what are you going to do?
the only thing i can do .
try and pull some strings with the administration
did you hear they're teaching japanese next year?
that's the rumor
and they're canceling latin .
what?
i tried to get latin canceled for five years " it's a dead language " , i'd always say
well , i guess they finally heard you .
excuse me !
could i see a list of all the people who've checked out this book in the past year?
look at that
i have seen wicked men and fools , a great many of both and i believe they both get paid in the end
but the fools first
the lad with the silver button
meet me on the corner in 10 minutes where are you goin '?
excellent !
that's was excellent !
i told mr. calloway the other day how fortunate we are to have someone like you looking out for dirk .
i'm just trying to impart some of the experiences i've accrued to help him .
this has my number on it
hello , dirk?
hi , mom !
how'd the math test go?
what math test?
no .
did you turn in your paper on the berlin airlift?
yeah , i got an extension .
so how did it go with mrs. calloway?
we shook hands
big deal !
and i gave her my phone number
buchan said he'd have already banged her by now what?
that's my best friend's mother he's talking about
i thought that's why you picked dirk as your chapel partner .
what are you , a lawyer?
it's max fisher .
oh , hi ! ...
what's the secret , max?
the secret?
yeah .
you seem to have it pretty figured out
i don't know .
i think you just gotta find something you love to do , then do it for the rest of your life
for me , it's going to rushmore
did you invite that kid to your party?
max fisher?
there's gonna be girls there .
i'd rather die pull your head out of your ass
do vidjenja .
bog , max .
vidimo se sutra .
may i see the back , please?
that's it thank , you
i need a signature on this geometry test
i know ... 37 % .
i don't know what to do anymore
it could have been worse .
you almost got the a
maybe i'm spending too much of my time starting up clubs and putting on plays
that's possible
i should probably be trying harder to score chicks .
that's the only thing anybody really cares about .
but it's not my forte , u
it'll happen , max .
it's just ...
you're like one of those clipper ship captains you're married to the sea
yes , that's true
but i've been out to sea for a long time
hello?
hi
i like your hat oh , thank you
you're a teacher here , aren't you?
and this is your first year at rushmore uh huh
how long have you been a smoker , if you don't mind me asking?
how old are you?
15
since i was your age you're kidding
you should quit you're right
and i should mind my own business
where'd you go to school , by the way?
harvard
really?
that's a coincidence .
my top schools where i want to apply to are oxford and the sorbonne .
but my safety is harvard
that's very ambitious .
thank you
what do you want to study?
i haven't decided for sure .
but probably a double major in mathematics and pre med
what was your major?
i didn't have a major .
but my thesis was on latin american economic policy
ah , that's interesting .
did you hear they're not going to teach latin here anymore?
this was more like central america
oh , central america and whatnot
but moving on , they're gonna cancel latin .
they've got to make room for japanese
that's a shame because all the romance languages are based on latin
yeah , they are nihilo sanctum estne?
what's that?
that's latin , isn't it?
what does that mean?
is nothing sacred?
glory fades i'm max fischer
sign here , please
is latin dead?
radje ti prekini radit 'sranja .
is that latin?
never in my wildest imagination did i ever dream i would have sons like this
what does your dad do , max
he's a neurosurgeon at st. joseph's hospital .
personally , i could never see myself cutting open somebody's brain .
but he seems to enjoy it
oh , no !
i got this one
you were in vietnam , if i'm not mistaken?
yeah
you were in the shit?
yeah , i was in the shit
what's on sunday?
oh , that's right .
the twin's birthday party
do you wanna come?
i'd love to .
except i've already got previous occupations to attend to .
thanks for the invitation , though
come work for me what do you mean?
i mean , i could use someone like you
i may not be rich , mr. blume and my father may only be a doctor but we manage 112th
excuse me , mr. blume nice talking to you
you're on the team?
i'm an alternate
miss cross?
i thought i would just let you know as per our conversation the other day ...
latin?
right .
the romance languages .
i gave a little speech
i heard about this you did?
i understand you made a very convincing argument .
i thought you'd be pleased to hear they're going to continue the latin program .
i'm very impressed thank you very much
you need an assistant?
do we get to have assistants around here?
i doubt it .
i'm on scholarship , though .
academic scholarship .
so i get to do odd jobs .
how did you decide to teach at rushmore?
my husband went here .
i didn't know you were married .
well , he's dead now .
so i'm not actually
when did he die?
last year
my mother's dead i'm sorry to hear that
she died when i was seven .
so we both have dead people in our families .
now what's going on in here?
these were just born
i don't want any alloys .
i want steel .
i don't give a rat's ass if he did
steel , harry
you change your mind?
you want the job?
no .
but i've got an idea .
and need some money
rushmore deserves an aquarium .
a first class aquarium where scientists can lecture and students can observe marine life in its
i don't know .
what do you think , ernie aquarium?
what kind of fish?
barracudas .
stingrays .
hammerheads .
piranhas ...
piranhas?
really?
yes , i'm talking to a guy in south america .
what did guggenheim say?
nothing .
i thought i should go to you first
because at this moment i feel our best strategy is to keep a low profile .
the more preparation i can do , the stronger our case will be when we take it to the administration .
how much money do you want? $35 . 000 for the initial plans
i'll give you $2500 o. k.
thank you you're welcome
max?
can i ask you something?
sure
has it ever crossed your mind that you're way too young for me?
it's crossed by mind that you might consider that a possibility , yes .
not to mention you're a student ...
i'm not trying to pressure you into anything , miss cross .
i'm surprised you brought it up so bluntly .
i just want to make sure ...
we've become friends , haven't we?
yes
and the truth is neither one of us has the slightest idea where this relationships is going .
we can't predict the future .
we don't have a relationship , max but we're friends
yes .
and that's all we're going to be that's what i meant by relationship .
you want me to grab a dictionary?
i just want to make sure we understand each other i understand .
you're not attracted to me
c'est la vie .
max .
you're fifteen .
attraction doesn't enter into it if you say so
all i'm getting is ...
i've never met anyone like you
you can take that for whatever it's worth
i think i can safely say i've never met anyone like you , either
you haven't , have you?
you want to shake hands?
i'm glad we had this conversation so am i
i can't wear a wire !
they're feeling me up every day !
oh , come on .
you'll have complete protection
i've heard that one before i got to go put a dime in the meter
joe , put a dime in the meter for officer serpico
if you agree to testify in open court ...
no !
no what?
no , i'm not gonna testify
i expect your gun and badge on my desk
promise me one thing , o'reilly .
you're going to follow this all the way to the end of the line , where i got to be .
so help me , god !
what happened to the cannoli line?
you're supposed to say " forget about it , sanchez
i made a mistake , all right?
it doesn't make any difference , anyway
hey , i'm letting it go .
but don't tell me it doesn't matter .
every line matters .
get off my back !
don't fuck with my play !
max !
i thought the acting tonight was excellent thanks .
well , it was better in rehersals
i'll catch up with you later , dad i've got a dinner to go to
oh , yeah?
yeah , cast and crew only

i got punched in the place

oh , no .
the old man's on call
mr. blume , i'd like you to meet miss cross and i didn't catch this young gentleman's name
i like your nurse's uniform , guy these are or scrubs
or they?
well , they're totally inappropriate for the occasion well , i didn't know we were going to dinner
that's because you weren't invited take it easy , max
you're the one who ordered him a scotch and soda
what's wrong with that?
i can write a hit play
why can't i have a drink when i want myself?
so tell me , curly .
how do you know miss cross?
we went to harvard together
and i wrote a hit play .
and directed it so i'm not sweating it , either
what do you think you're doing?
i'm getting the check
no , you're not .
excuse me .
i just wanted to thank you again for accommodating us .
we only expected to be a party of three , but somebody invited himself along .
i apologize .
quite all right ok
you're being rude , max .
no , i'm not
i'm just trying to figure out why you brought this gentleman to my play and my dinner , which was invitation only
would you like me to pass you the butter?
yes , please
what's wrong with you?
what's wrong with you?
you hurt my feelings this night was important to me
how did i hurt your feelings?
oh , my god !
i wrote a hit play
and i'm in love with you
hi were you hiding over there?
didn't wanna distrupt class
what's that you're painting?
that's a jelly fish
what can i do for you , mr. blume?
max wants to talk to you

to apologize , i think
we should talk over here
he sent you here?
yeah
are you his messenger?
no .
i'm his friend
you were right i shouldn't have allow him to drink
i don't think i should see max anymore he's not going to like the sound of that

rosemary .
what's yours?
herman
he wrote you a letter .
dear miss cross , i would like to take this opportunity to formly apologize for the events of night of the 23th

<p>i hope you will attend , if possible .
i remain your friend , max fisher .

beck , good to see you
this is where they're building the new aquarium i'm in charge of the committee , if you can believe it
this is the baseball diamond i believe it's being relocated a few feet over
is it true the aquarium will have piranhas?
where'd you hear that?
my source indicated that it was a possibility
yes , it's true but promises are very tricky max
bad news what's the story?
she has a substitute teacher today why?
i guess she got sick you know she's not sick .
give me the phone
janet !
max fischer .
is blume there?
oh , where is he?
goddammit , he's supposed to be here
i don't give a shit about barracudas but fuck it .
i'm building it anyway
max !
hello , dr. guggenheim !
what do you think you're doing?
we're having a fund raiser for ...
turn that damn thing off
tell me this isn't happening .
i'd rather not have this conversation in front of the crew .
we have a new student with us today .
his name's max fischer and he's actually asked to say a few words to the class .
max?
you want to take it away?
sure .
thanks very much
i just wanted to introduce myself
i'm max fischer .
i'm a former student of rushmore academy , which i recently got expelled from
this is my first time in a public school .
and i know you probably think i was born with a silverspoon in my mouth
but i'm no elitist .
i think you've got some great facilities and i'm really looking forward to making the best of it over here
i noticed you don't have a fencing team .
i'm going to start one up .
let me know if you'd like to join
max?
yes?
hi .
i'm margaret yang .
i'm in mrs. whitney's class .
i just wanted to tell you i liked your speech
i don't think i've ever heard of anyone asking to give a speech in class before
how unfortunate !
the silver spoon remark might rub some people the wrong way but i think i know how you meant it
do you know it?
i gotta go to class right here
janet , max fischer .
is he in?
hey , max .
how's it going?
terrible
tell me something .
when you talk to miss cross the other day ...
excuse me .
do you have a telephone pass?
one second
i got to tell you .
i don't know what you see in her .
i don't think she's right for you .
what's that supposed to mean?
i mean , she's not that beautiful .
she's not that intriguing
she has something you can put your finger on .
but ...
look , mr. blume .
your comments are valuable .
but let's get to the point
will she see me again?
yes or no?
no
i'm talking on the telephone
oh , come on .
that's rude .
hey , fisher !
you better beat it , sunnie
you know , fischer .
i've been watching you .
showboat , always talking , picking a kid like dirk
because his mother's a great piece and then getting nowhere
like everything you do .
big show .
no results .
what do you call getting a hand job from mrs. calloway in her jaguar?
a fucking lie?
you think i got kicked out for just the aquarium?
nah .
it was the hand job .
you wanna know something else?
it was worth it
i'm sorry i embarrassed you at dinner and please apologize to what's his name for me
i will .
are you ok?
i'm fine .
but i miss rushmore .
i miss the seasons .
and watching the leaves change
by the way , what time does the library close?
i got an overdue book to turn in
that's your handwriting , isn't it?
my husband gave me this book when he came to visit to me when i was 13
and he went to rushmore .
so when he died i gave it to the library here
you remind me of him , you know?
i do?
how?
you remember you were in the rushmore beekeepers?
yeah .
i was president of them
he founded that club
do you think we can be friends again , miss cross?
in a strictly platonic way?
of course , i do
do you think you can make a go of it and settle down at grover cleveland?
yeah .
but i need a tutor
ok !
what else do we got?
hi , max hello
what was your name again?
margaret yang
what are you doing seventh period , margaret yang?
i have guitar lessons
classical guitar or?

and bring a headshot , please
hello , herman .
how are you , rosemary?
fine , thanks .
i just got home and i'm having a little snack
having some carrots?
nice house !
yeah , it isn't mine .
i'm just sort of housesitting
were you in the neighborhood?
didn't max have something planned for us today?
a trip to the museum or something?
i don't think so .
i think he's rehearsing tonight
oh .

his new play
he's really making a go of it over at grover cleveland yeah .
he's doing very well , isn't he?
you want a carrot?
yeah .

i'll probably be seeing you soon
or we could go for a walk , if you like
sure well , this is nice , isn't it?
kind of brisk .
i'll just get a sweater .
i'll be back in a minute
dirk?
i know about you and the teacher
does max know?
no .
and i don't want him to know .
i just want it to stop .
right now
you're a married man , blume .
and you're supposed to be his friend
look , dirk .
i am his friend oh , yeah .
and with friends like you , who needs friends?
unlock it !
little calloway !
you're standing up for the wrong guy .
fischer ain't your mate
what are you talking about , buchan?
he thinks your mum's good for a bonk that's why he picked you as his chapel partner
who sold you that crock?
he told me himself
he says she gave him a hand job in the backseat of her bloody jaguar max never said that
yeah .
i suppose you're right .
after all , the son of a brain doctor doesn't need to impress anybody , does he?
the killing has got to stop , esse it's getting too loco .
no more gats nigger , you're the crazy one
people will be trying to kill you .
are you talking about getting rid of your gun?
it's time , homey kiss me , little one
then he kisses her and we're out .
ok is that for me?
dear max , i'm sorry to say that i have secretly found out that mr. blume is having an affair with miss cross .
my first suspicions came when i saw them frenching in front of her house then i knew for sure when they went skinny dipping
in mr. blume's swimming pool , giving each other hand jobs while you were taking a nap on the front porch
why am i telling you this now?
because you're such a good friend take care , pal .
fondly , dirk calloway
how was she , herman?
jesus christ !
was she good?
i bet she was .
although i wouldn't know 'cause i never screwed her
going skinny dipping while i took a nap .
are you comfortable , max?
" i'll just be out back nude getting hand jobs from the woman you love " we never went skipping dipping
sure , you didn't .
and next you're going to tell me you didn't just walk out of her house at two o'clock in the morning
i'm in love with her
well , i was in love with her first
and all that crap about " i don't think she's that great " " i don't think she's right for you , max " that was all bullshit , wasn '
do you think she's in love with you?
i don't know
well , i guarantee you she's not and she never will be

i paid eight million dollars
and that's all you're prepared to spend?
i'm sorry you couldn't make it to the little ground breaking the other day
it's kind of a shame , since he's building it for you
i never asked anybody to build me an aquarium
i'm not sure how that rumor got started me , neither
you think edward appleby would've built you one?
yeah .
he probably would've if he had the money
that's what i thought .
blume's got a little more spark and vitality than you expected , doesn't he?
but the aquarium was your idea well , i gave it to my friend
fifteen sticks?
yes , please
could you make the order out to ready demolition?
thank you very much
