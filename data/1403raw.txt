long is the way , and hard , that out of hell ...
leads up to light .
fuck him .
so what?
he's right , so far .
imagine the will it takes to keep a man bound for a full year .
to sever his hand and to use it ... to plant fingerprints .
to insert tubes into his genitals .
this guy's methodical , exacting ... and worst of all , patient .
he's a nut bag .
because the fucker's got a library card doesn't make him yoda .
you got money?
i got 50 .
fifty bucks .
i propose a field trip .
come on .
we'll make a list .
at the top we'll put " purgatory " ...
canterbury tales , " anything relating to the 7 deadly sins .
ask yourself .
wait .
what would he study to do the things he's done?
what are his interests now?
jack the ripper , for instance .
where are we going?
library .
coupons .
coupons .
free coupons .
discount
discount coupons .
they must have had about 50 health violations during the last inspection .
sit across from me?
i don't want people thinking ... we're dating .
give me your money .
i'll give you this , but i ought to know what are we doing .
somerset .
how you doing?
didn't expect a menage a trois .
it's not a problem .
sit down .
only for you do i do this , so it's a big risk .
so we're in this fair and square .
it's a deal .
about an hour .
yep .
help yourself .
that was money well spent .
yeah .
alright .
telling you this , i'm trusting you more than i trust most people .
good , 'cause i might punch you .
it's probably nothing , but even so , it's no skin off our teeth .
the guy in the pizza parlor is a friend from the bureau .
who , stinky man?
for years , the fbl's been hooked into the library system , keeping records .
assessing fines?
no , monitoring reading habits .
look .
certain books are flagged .
books on , say , nuclear weapons ...
mein kampf " .
anyone who checks out a flagged book has his library records fed to the fbl .
wait .
how is this legal?
legal . illegal .
these terms don't apply .
you can't use the information directly .
it's just a useful guide .
it might sound silly , but you can't get a library card without an id ... and a current phone bill .
see?
so they run our list .
precisely .
if you want to know who's reading ...
purgatory " , " paradise lost " and " helter skelter " ... the fbl's computers will tell us .
it could give us a name .
of a college kid writing a term paper ... on 20th century crime .
at least you're out of the office .
get a haircut .
how do you know this?
i don't .
neither do you .
exactly .
divine comedy " .
history of catholicism " a book called " murderers and madmen " .
modern homicide investigation " .
in cold blood " .
of human bondage " .
bondage?
it's not what you think .
the marquis de sade .
marquis de sade .
whatever .
works of st. thomas aqua something ...
saint thomas aquinas .

he wrote about the seven deadly sins .
is that it?
yep .
let's try it .
jonathan doe?
whatever .
we're sure about that name , are we?
you were , you saw it .
john doe .
you want to go back , i'll go back .
let's take a look at him .
talk to him .
this is crazy .
we'll just talk to him .
excuse me , sir .
do you happen to be a serial killer?
you do the talking .
put that silver tongue of yours to work .
you've talked to my wife?
retarded .
charlie's fucking angels .
a name off a computer .
mills .
you hit?
no .
he's going down !
fifth floor !
police .
is there a back way out?
lock your door .
get out of the fucking hall , please .
get down !
get the fuck down .
goddamn it .
get out of the fucking way .
clear .
where are you going?
i'm going in .
no , no .
wait .
wait .
what?
he fucking shot at us .
you can't go in .
we need a warrant .
we got probable cause .
come on .
think about it .
think how did we get here?
i can't tell anyone about the bureau .
get out of the way .
we have no reason to be here .
would you listen to me?
get off , get the fuck off me .
alright , i'm sorry .
just pay attention a minute?
with a hole like this , we won't be able to prosecute .
the fucking guy'll walk .
that's what you want?
by the time we clear a warrant ...
fuck that .
we need a reason to knock on this door .
think about it .
okay?
okay , okay .
you're right .
i'm all fucked up .
when you're right , you're right .
well ... no point in arguing anymore .
unless you can fix that ..
you stupid son of a ...
how much money we got left?
so , yeah , i noticed ... this guy going out a lot ... when the murders were happening , so i ...
so you called det .
somerset?
she called somerset .
'cause this guy ... was creepy and shit , and one of the murders ...
happened right over there .
i told you the rest .
got everything?
have her sign .
you must sign .
good .
you did good .
i did what you said .
here .
you get something to eat .
everybody stay outside .
victor .
wild bill's leather
fuck .
lust
somerset !
what?
we had him .
what are you saying?
the fucking photographer in ... the fucking stairs .
we had him and we let him go .
you're sure this is him?
yep .
good .
get it out .
no pay stubs .
no appointment books .
no addresses .
just this receipt .
keep looking !
wait , look at this .
this was under the bed .
his only source of funds?
we got his money .
i like it .
wait .
you won't believe this .
we haven't found a fingerprint .
not one .
right .
i don't believe you .
keep looking .
we could use some more men .
i'm doing my best .
what're you getting?
there are 2, 000 notebooks here ... and each notebook contains about 250 pages .
what about the killings?
what sick ridiculous puppets we are , what a gross stage we dance on .
what fun , dancing and fucking .
not a care in the world .
not knowing that we're nothing .
we are not what was intended .
wait , there's a lot more .
on the subway today , a man came up to start a conversation .
he made small talk , a lonely man talking about the weather and things .
i tried to be pleasant ... but my head began to hurt from his banality .
i almost didn't notice ... but i suddenly threw up all over him .
he was not pleased ... and i couldn't stop laughing " .
no dates .
placed on the shelves in no discernible order .
just his mind poured out on paper .
looks like a life's work .
with 50 men reading in 24 hour shifts , it'd still ...
take 2 months .
i know .
phone?
phone?
phone?
phone?
people , quiet !
i admire you .
i don't know how you found me , but i was surprised !
i respect you law enforcement officers more every day .
well , i appreciate that , john .
i'll be re adjusting my schedule in light of today's setback .
i just had to call and express my admiration .
sorry i had to hurt ... one of you , but i had no choice , right?
you'll accept my apology?
i'd like to say more but that'd ruin the surprise .
got it .
everybody back to work .
you were right .
he's preaching .
these murders are his sermons to us .
look , we know him .
we know him .
we know him .
who's the blonde?
looks like a pro .
maybe .
she caught john doe's eye .
wild bills 'leather
he came and collected it last night .
last night?
yeah .
this man?
john doe , easy name to remember .
he had a limp .
what was this job you did for him?
i've got a picture .
one sweet piece , actually .
i thought he was a performance artist .
you know the sort of guy that ... pisses in a cup on stage and then ... drinks it .
performance art .
right .
i think i undercharged him .
you made this for him?
i've made ... weirder shit than that .
they found the blonde .
the picture !
the picture !
fucking pigs .
i need you to move .
i'll come out , but you guys ...
get the fuck out of the booth .
i've been in this cage the whole time .
come on , this way .
can you do something about the music?
we're looking for the guy .
you from homicide?
you better see this .
get this thing off me .
oh god , get it off of me .
get him out of here , now !
i want to hear it again .
tell me again .
you heard nothing strange , saw nothing strange .
he asked me if i was married .
i saw a gun in his hand .
where was the girl?
the what?
what?
the prostitute .
where was she?
someone comes to your establishment ... they want to go downstairs , get some oo la la .
whatever .
they got to come to you .
yeah?
yeah .
you didn't see anyone?
with a package?
a knapsack?
something under their arm?
everybody that comes in there's got to be a package under their arms .
some guys are carrying suitcases full of stuff .
she was just sitting on the bed .
who tied her down?
you or him?
do you like what you do for a living?
all these things you see?
no , i don't .
but that's life , isn't it?
he had a gun .
and ... he made it happen .
he made me do it .
he put that thing on me .
and he made me wear it .
then he ... told me to fuck her .
and i did .
i fucked her .
oh , god !
oh , god !
oh , god , he had a gun in my mouth .
the fucking gun was in my throat .
fuck .
oh , god .
god .
god , help me .
please , please , help me .
this won't have a happy ending .
it's not possible .
we catch him , i'll be happy enough .
if we catch john doe and he turns out to be the devil ... if he's satan himself ... that might meet our expectations .
but he's not the devil .
he's just a man .
you know ...
you bitch and you complain and you tell me these things .
if you think you're preparing me for hard time ... thanks , but ...
but you got to be a hero .
you want to be a champion .
people don't want a champion .
they want cheeseburgers ...
play lotto and watch tv .
how did you get like this?
i want to know .
it wasn't one thing , i'll tell you that .
go on .
i don't think i can continue to live in a place ... that embraces and nurtures apathy as if it was a virtue .
you aren't different or better .
i didn't say i was .
i'm not .
hell , i sympathize .
i sympathize completely .
apathy is a solution .
i mean , it's easier to lose yourself in drugs than it is to cope with life .
it's easier to steal what you want than to earn it .
it's easier ... to beat a child than to raise it .
love costs .
it takes effort , work .
we talk about mentally ill people .
we are talking about fucking crazies .
no , we're not .
yes , today .
no , we're talking about everyday life here .
you can't afford to be this naive .
fuck off .
see , you ...
you should listen to yourself .
yeah .
you say that ... the problem is people don't care .
so , i don't care about people .
nonsense .
you know why?
you care?
want to know damn right .
you'll make a difference .
whatever .
the point is that ... you're not quitting because you believe ... these things you say .
you want to believe them ... because you're quitting .
and you want me to agree with you and say " you're right , it's all fucked up .
it's a fucking mess .
we should all go live in a fucking log cabin .
but i won't .
i won't say that .
i don't agree with you .
i do not .
i can't .
i'm going home .
thank you , though .
i love you .
so much .
i know .
sunday
sunday
what's your emergency?
could you repeat that?
i've done it again .
prlde
what have we got?
sleeping pills .
glued to one hand .
telephone glued to the other .
you see what he did?
he sliced her up .
then he bandaged her .
call for help and you'll live .
but you'll be disfigured .
or put yourself out of your own misery .
come on .
he cut off her nose .
to spite her face .
and he did it very recently .
listen ...
i've decided to stay on till this is done .
one of two things'll happen .
either we'll get john doe ... or he'll kill 7 and this case will never end .
don't do me any favors .
thank you , but i got it .
i'm asking to be your partner a few more days .
you'd be doing me a favor .
you knew i'd say yes .
we're here .
your wife called .
get an answering machine .
detective?
after this i'm gone .
no big surprise .
detective !
you're looking for me .
don't fucking move .
on the floor .
stay back .
on the fucking floor .
i know you .
now .
get down .
get down on your stomach .
you piece of shit .
now !
all the way .
all the way ... fucker .
down .
faster .
faster , fucker .
now .
nose on the ground .
jesus christ .
what the fuck is this?
i'd like to speak to my lawyer , please .
goddamn it .
he cuts the skin off the tips of his fingers .
that's why we couldn't ... find 1 print in his apartment .
seems he's done that for a while .
what about the bank accounts?
the guns?
so far everything is a dead end .
no credit history .
no employment records .
a 5 year old bank account opened with cash .
we've tried tracing his furniture .
all we know about him ... is that he's independently wealthy ... well educated ... and totally insane .
because he's john doe by choice .
when can we question him?
you can't .
he goes to court now .
there's no way he'd turn himself in .
it doesn't make any sense .
there he sits .
it's not supposed to make any sense .
he's not finished .
he's pissing in our faces and we're taking it .
you know what i'm saying .
for the first time ever , you and i are in total agreement .
he wouldn't just stop .
so what the fuck , man?
he's 2 murders away from completing his masterpiece .
we'll wait for his plea .
my client says there're 2 more bodies .
two more victims hidden away .
my client says there're 2 more bodies .
two more victims hidden away .
he will take detectives mills and somerset to these bodies , only them ... and only at 6 o'clock today .
why us?
he says he admires you .
it's part of the game .
if they don't accept this offer , these bodies will never be found .
frankly , i'm inclined to let them rot .
we've got him .
downstairs , locked up .
done deal .
he'll get his free room and board , cable tv .
my wife doesn't even have cable .
why are we discussing this?
no .
something stinks .
and this one you .
in your $3, 000 suit ... and that smug smile on your face .
dealing for that piece of shit .
i don't like it .
the law requires me to serve ... my clients and their interests as best i can .
we don't make deals here , mr. swarr .
my client informs you that ... if you do not accept , he'll plead insanity .
let him try it .
i'd like to see it .
we know with the extreme nature of these crimes i'd get him off ... with such a plea .
i won't let this conviction slide .
if you do accept under his specific conditions , he'll sign ... a full confession , plead guilty right now .
it's your case .
make a decision .
full confession .
i'm in .
it must be both of you .
if he were to claim insanity ... this conversation is admissible .
that he's blackmailing us with his plea .
my client wants to remind you , 2 more are dead .
the press'd love to find out the police weren't concerned ... about finding and burying them .
if in fact there are 2 more dead .
the lab report came .
they did a quickie on doe's clothing and fingernails .
they found blood from doe's fingers , blood from ... the woman who's face he cut off , and blood from ... a third party ... as yet unidentified .
you'd be escorting an unarmed man .
let's finish it .
if john doe's head splits open and a ufo flies out ...
i want you to expect it .
i will .
if i accidentally shaved off a nipple , would it be covered by workman's comp?
i suppose so .
if you were man enough to file a claim ...
i'd buy you one out of my own pocket .
i keep coming home late , my wife'll think something's up .
you know ...
yeah .
what?
will this wind hurt us?
who are you , john?
who are you really?
what do you mean?
at this stage , what harm can it do to tell us about yourself?
doesn't matter who i am .
who i am means absolutely nothing .
stay on your left up here .
where are we heading?
you'll see .
we're not just going to pick up 2 more bodies , are we?
that wouldn't be shocking enough .
you've got newspapers to think about , yeah?
wanting people to listen ... you can't just ... tap them on the shoulder anymore .
you have to use a sledgehammer .
then you'll get their strict attention .
why're you so special that people should listen?
i'm not special .
i've never been exceptional .
this is , though .
what i'm doing .
my work .
your work , john?
yes .
see , i don't see anything special about it , john .
that's not true .
no , it is true .
and the funny thing is , all this work ... in 2 months , no one'll care , or give a shit , or even remember .
you can't see the whole complete act yet .
but when this is done ... when it's finished ... it's going to be ...
people will barely be able to comprehend .
but they won't be able to deny .
could the freak be more vague?
as far as master plans go ...
i really can't wait for you to see .
it's going to be something .
know what?
i'll be standing next to you .
so when this thing happens , be sure and let me know .
don't want to miss it .
oh , don't worry .
you won't .
you won't miss a thing .
what's so exciting?
it's not too far now .
i've tried to figure something in my head .
maybe you can help me out .
when a person is insane , as you clearly are , do you know ... that you're insane?
maybe you're reading ... masturbating in your own feces ...
wow , it's amazing how fucking crazy i really am "?
you know?
do you guys do that?
it's more comfortable for you to label me insane .
it's very comfortable .
it's not something i would expect you to accept .
but i did not choose .
i was chosen .
whatever .
i don't doubt that you believe that . but it seems that you're ... overlooking a contradiction .
meaning what?
glad you asked .
if you were chosen ... that is , by a higher ... power ... and if your hand was forced ... it seems strange to me that you'd get such enjoyment .
you enjoyed torturing those people .
that doesn't seem to fit with martyrdom , does it?
john?
i doubt i enjoyed it more than det .
mills would enjoy time alone with me ... in a room without windows .
isn't that true?
how'd you like to ...
hurt me with impunity?
that hurts my feelings .
i would never .
you wouldn't only because there's consequences .
it's in those eyes of yours , though .
nothing wrong with a man taking pleasure in his work .
i won't deny my own personal desire ... to turn each sin against the sinner .
wait a minute , i thought all you did was kill innocent people .
innocent?
is that supposed to be funny?
an obese man .
disgusting man who could barely stand .
you'd point him out to your friends so that they'd join you in mocking him .
if you saw him while you ate , you couldn't finish your meal .
then the lawyer .
you had to secretly thank me for that .
this is a man who dedicated his life ... to making money by lying with every breath he could muster to keep ... murderers and rapists ...
on the streets .
murderers?
murderers , like yourself?
a woman ... so ugly inside that she couldn't go on living ... if she couldn't be beautiful outside?
a drug dealer .
a pederast , actually .
let's not forget ... the disease spreading whore .
only in a world this shitty ... could you say they were innocent and keep a straight face .
but that's the point .
we see a deadly sin on every street corner ... in every home and we ... tolerate it .
we tolerate it because it's common .
it's trivial .
we tolerate it morning , noon and night .
well , not anymore .
i'm setting the example .
and what i've done will be ... puzzled over ... and studied ... and followed ... forever .
yeah .
delusions of grandeur .
you should be thanking me .
why's that , john?
because you'll be remembered after this .
realize , detective , the only reason that i'm here now ... is that i wanted to be .
no .
we would have got you eventually .
oh , really?
so what were you doing , biding your time?
toying with me?
allowing 5 " innocent " people to die until ... you felt like springing your trap?
what was the indisputable ... evidence you were going to use on me , right before ...
i walked up to you and put my hands in the air?
john .
calm down .
i remember us knocking on your door .
that's right .
and i seem to remember breaking your face .
you're only alive because i didn't kill you .
okay .
sit back .
i spared you .
sit back .
remember that when you look in the mirror ... for the rest of your life ... or should i say for the rest of what life i allow you ... to have .
sit back , you fucking freak !
shut your fucking mouth !
you're no messiah .
you're a movie of the week .
a fucking tee shirt ... at best .
don't ask me to pity those people .
i don't mourn them any more than the 1000's that died at sodom & gomorrah .
is that to say , john , that what you were doing was god's good work?
the lord works in mysterious ways .
do you see those high tension towers?
that's where we're headed .
i see it .
9 o'clock , and follow that road .
there sure as shit is no ambush out here .
no fucking nothing out here .
they'll come up behind us in about 2 minutes .
i want you to go way up .
in thirty seconds , bank east on my mark .
thirty seconds .
i'll get him .
get out .
slowly .
stop .
stay .
what do you got?
a dead dog .
i didn't do that .
what time is it?
why?
i'd like to know .
7 : 01 .
it's close .
let's go take a look .
it's this way .
down .
down .
down .
watch him .
there he goes .
it's good we have some time to talk .
the guy in red .
keep the crosshairs on him .
a van's coming down the road .
from the north .
be ready for anything .
wait for my signal .
wait for me .
get out !
out !
jesus christ , man .
don't shoot .
step away .
turn around .
hands on your head .
what's going on?
why are you here?
i'm delivering a package for this guy , david .
detective ...
david mills .
get it .
slowly .
a guy paid me $500 to bring it out here .
he wanted it here at exactly 7 o'clock .
put it down .
we got a box .
we got a box .
call the bomb squad .
bomb squad .
we got a box .
face the van .
hands up .
turn .
okay .
go .
off you go .
go .
i'm sending the driver out on foot .
he's headed north , along the road .
have him picked up .
oh , i don't know .
i don't know .
i'm going to open it .
when i said i admired you , i meant what i said .
it's blood .
you've made quite a life for yourself , detective .
you should be very proud .
shut the fuck up , you piece of shit .
california , stay away from here .
stay away from here , now .
don't , don't , don't come in here .
whatever you hear , stay away .
john doe has the upper hand .
here he comes .
throw your gun down !
what?
i wish i could have lived like you .
shut up .
what the fuck you talkin 'about?
do you hear me , detective?
i'm trying to tell you how much ...
i admire you and your pretty wife .
what?
tracy .
what'd you fucking say?
it's disturbing ... how easily a member of the press can purchase ... information from the men in your precinct .
what the fuck?
throw your gun down !
i visited your home this morning ... after you left .
i tried to play husband .
i tried to taste the life of a simple man .
throw it away !
it didn't work out .
so ...
i took a souvenir .
her pretty head .
what's , what's he talking about?
give me the gun .
what's goin 'on over there?
would you ...
put the gun down .
i saw you with the box .
what was in the box?
because i envy your normal life .
put the gun down , david .
it seems that envy is my sin .
what's in the box?
not until you give me the gun .
what's in the fucking box?
he just told you .
you lie !
you're a fucking liar !
shut up !
that's what he wants .
he wan he wants you to shoot him .
no !
no .
you tell me .
you tell me that's not true .
that's not true .
become vengeance , david .
she's all right .
you tell me .
become ... wrath .
tell me she's all right !
if you murder a suspect , david ... you just throw it all away and he knows it .
she begged for her life , detective .
shut up !
she begged for her life ... and for the life of the baby inside of her .
he didn't know .
give me the gun , david .
if you kill him ... he will win .
oh god !
oh god !
well , we'll take care of him .
whatever he needs .
where you gonna be?
around .
i'll be around .
the world is a fine place and worth fighting for .
i agree with the second part .
