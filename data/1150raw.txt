so , you're finally settling down .
you've saved up a little nest egg and are ready to dive into the real estate market .
let's do a little shopping around .
the american dream home .
two bedrooms , two bathrooms , one doghouse , one garage , two garbage cans .
it's cozy , safe , and just barely within your overstretched budget .
not for you?
for the same price , you can buy 200 , 000 acres of prime sahara wasteland .
put up a cottage .
nothing but you and the sky .
it's like a beach without the ocean .
and talk about quiet neighbors .
too remote?
oh , i understand .
you need the thrill and excitement of the big city .
with that same nest egg , you can get a slice of prime real estate .
not this real estate .
cozy and affordable , this lovely fixer upper is the perfect place for a dynamic couple like you .
no need to putter around the house .
it's all right there where you stand .
what's the matter?
feeling a little cramped?
well , just a stone's throw away , just one bridge or a tunnel ride , just outside the big , bustling city , there is a place with wide open spaces , friendly natives , and spacious dwellings .
and it's all within your price range .
it's almost too good to be true .
when i told you
i had a particular building in mind for you , this is the one i was talking about .
it's a historical home on one of the best blocks in all of brooklyn .
remember what we talked about .
i know .
poker face .
built ins , built ins .
oh , the kitchen's a little small .
well , rip out this awful room divider , and you've got an eat in kitchen .
and over here you have your library .
wow .
for your books .
oh , you like books?
i have a little collection of first edition novels .
alex is a writer .
the parlor .
oh , my god .
so , this staircase .
this leads to where?
i thought you realized .
this is a duplex .
as in two floors for the price of one?
i believe it's right there in the listing sheet .
so , why was it sealed off?
were there , like , a slew of murders up there or something?
no , there's just a sweet , little old lady that lives upstairs .
a tenant?
mm hmm .
so , rent control means we can't kick her out , right?
alex !
that's a legitimate question .
you cannot evict her .
she has to decide to leave or , god forbid ...
poor thing hasn't been feeling well lately .
she's gotta be close to 100 years old .
mrs. connelly?
it may take her a while .
she's hard of hearing .
mrs. connelly?
kenneth .
there's my favorite girl .
how you feeling today , mrs. connelly?
i don't feel too good , kenneth .
oh , i'm sorry to hear that , mrs. connelly .
i brought by a young couple that may want to buy the apartment .
hi .
hi , mrs. connelly .
i'm nancy kendricks .
this is my husband , alex rose .
hello .
we were wondering if we could look around .
i don't feel up to it .
i'm sorry , dear .
nice seeing you again , kenneth .
you have a mommy and me park over here .
you got shopping that way .
no traffic .
it is ideal .
here's my card if you want to make an offer .
there's a lot of heat on this place .
i'd say it'll be off the market by monday .
adios .
three fireplaces?
guys , the place sounds incredible .
and surprisingly affordable .
it's kind of affordable .
it's really at the high end of our price range .
but when you factor in that it's a duplex .
it's a duplex?
yes .
oh .
you know , it's brooklyn , first of all .
we weren't even thinking about brooklyn , so ...
oh , actually , which reminds me .
did you bring it?
oh , yeah .
is this the latest in the don piper mystery series?
fresh off the presses .
i inscribed this copy to you guys .
oh !
coop , thank you .
i am sure it's not gonna be as brilliant as your new book , but a couple decent metaphors in there .
turn of phrase .
we forgot to tell them the big news .
oh , god .
yes .
what is it?
go ahead .
we're pregnant .
wow !
congratulations .
congratulations , man .
i'm so happy for you !
you guys must have just found out .
no .
unh unh .
i'm four months along .
yeah .
four months?
mm hmm .
oop !
oh , honey .
stop .
hello !
i mean , we're not gonna want to live here once we start having babies .
and that upstairs would make the cutest playroom .
well , i don't want mrs. connelly coughing on my baby .
you know what i mean .
besides , do you realize how much the duplex is gonna be worth once we get both floors?
i know how much it costs .
it's gonna be worth a bazillion times that .
really?
a bazillion?
that's an incredible return .
come on , alex , what better way to finish your novel than in your own 19th century oak writer's nook?
it would be nice not to write at starbucks with the other novelists .
because you deserve your own nook .
that's my train .
all right .
let's do it .
really?
yeah .
aah !
oh , this is so wonderful .
we're gonna have a home .
yeah .
all right .
i love you .
i love you !
i could have sworn we had more stuff .
it's gonna look great .
mrs. connelly , it's nancy kendricks and alex rose , from downstairs .
let me look at you .
oh !
hi .
we just wanted to come up and say hi .
oh , what a nice surprise .
come in .
come in .
thank you .
wow .
what an amazing apartment !
oh , thank you , dear .
sit down .
we brought you this little housewarming gift .
that's very kind of you .
thank you .
i'll open it for you .
i don't drink , myself .
it's a sin .
irish catholics don't drink?
what are you doing?
oh , i'm just taking a few little pictures for research .
if i knew you were coming , i'd have tidied up .
hey , nancy .
yeah?
blow me down !
oh !
what did you say?
are you all right?
yeah .
oh , god !
i'm coming , slowly but surely .
i'll just turn off this music .
alex !
alex !
sit down , dears .
sit down .
i've brought you a little something to nibble on as well .
oh , bugles .
wow .
i didn't realize they even still made bugles .
here you go .
that's a magnificent parrot .
it's not a parrot , dear .
he's a macaw .
he's named after my late husband , richard .
i've had little dick for 40 years .
come along , dear .
don't be shy .
it's french onion .
oh .
mrs. connelly , how are you feeling?
why do you ask , dear?
well , because the last time we saw you , you were quite ill .
oh , i had a bit of a cold , but i'm in fine fettle now .
tell me about yourselves .
what do you do , alan?
alex .
alex is a writer .
oh , a writer .
hmm .
i always thought of that as more of a hobby than a real job .
i suppose i'm forgetting about joyce .
joyce .
james joyce .
of course .
wonderful writer .
he died drunk and penniless .
well , alex's first novel was published in hardback , and he's about to finish his second one .
oh , what's it about?
well , i like to call it an urban epic .
it's about three generations of this family that own a printing press , and i tell a story .
that's nice .
let me give you a refill .
big dick had the taste , too .
he was a seaman .
the drink took him from me in 1963 .
we'd been married for 58 years .
'63 .
so , when are you two planning on having children?
soon .
yeah , not for a couple of years .
you sound just like mr. connelly .
we never had any children .
it's too late for me now .
oh , look at the time .
i had no idea it was so late .
oh .
the time's rolled on .
we haven't had a chance to see the apartment .
oh , dear , i'm afraid there's no time now .
really?
we must say good night .
oh , okay .
oh .
uh oh .
oh , no .
that was your ...
i think it's your couch .
i think the chair ...
alex .
that was a little ...
come along , dears .
come along .
how could you?
a macaw .
any long tailed , brightly colored parrot .
a macaw is a parrot .
i knew it .
don't you think that as landlords , we have some legal right to see the back of her apartment if we want to?
i mean , i'll look it up on the internet .
that's what i'll do .
i wonder how old she is .
oh , my guess is that she's somewhere between 95 and 105 .
she looked pretty good tonight .
yeah , she did .
she looked kind of healthy .
yeah .
that's nice .
yeah .
hi .
hello , mr. peabody .
i saw myself in the mirror , and i thought it was my mother's tush .
mrs. connelly?
mrs. connelly?
oh , yes?
who is it?
hi , it's alex .
i was wondering if you could turn down your tv ,
'cause we can hear it .
oh , i fell asleep .
i'm sorry .
that's okay .
i'll do that .
okay .
thank you .
no , starvin 'marvin , that's my potpie .
cartman , you butt pipe .
this is the time of year to share .
oh , yeah , you're right .
are you going to eat your peach cobbler?
no , you don't want all that .
why don't you share it with me?
everybody's asking me about fiber .
in the next few minutes , you're going to learn about an amazing ...
if i want a slimmer waist .
use it on carpets .
oxiclean seeks out organic stains .
there's no more bald jokes .
i gotta go .
have a good day .
see you later .
and finish that chapter !
i will .
good morning , alex .
good morning , mrs. connelly .
i wanted to give you this back .
i won't drink it , and i thought you might want it .
oh , thank you .
that's nice of you .
all right , if there's anything i can do for you , let me know .
there is one thing .
yeah , i'm sorry , i don't hear anything .
it was very distinctive .
the pipes went bang bang bangity bang bang .
bang !
bang !
well , they're not doing that anymore , or it stopped , so , i'll tell you what , though .
if you hear it again , come get me .
i'll take a listen .
oh , all right then .
it's a deal .
ooh , alan , dear boy , i wonder ...
alex .
pardon?
alex .
my name's alex .
i know .
no , i think you said " alan .
oh , no , i don't think so .
i don't forget names .
could you give me a hand with the garbage?
we don't want to be feeding the mice .
what in heaven's name are you doing with me drawers?
now , i would move the pull quote just a teeny bit so that you'll have room to squeeze in the text .
you're such a good squeezer , nancy .
that's because , until yesterday ,
i lived in an apartment the size of a small child .
but look at the new place .
oh , my god !
isn't it gorgeous?
yes .
there's , like , this living room/ parlor area .
nancy , did you finish the " celebrity scene " page?
oh , tickety boo .
i don't know what that means .
it means you'll have it soon .
well , if you mean i'll have it soon , why don't you say i'll have it soon?
tickety boo " is just confusing for everybody .
oh , mr. peabody .
how did that get in there?
ohh .
alex?
alex?
hey .
hi !
hi .
how was work?
oh , herman's freaking out , as usual .
were you napping?
no , i was just rearranging my book collection .
in the dark?
and then i closed my eyes for a second .
just to think , and , you know .
is this dinner?
mm hmm .
so , how was your nook?
did you get , like , five or six million pages written?
more like five or six words .
our upstairs neighbor had me doing chores for her all day .
really?
yeah .
well , you just gotta set some boundaries .
just tell her you're working .
she'll understand .
what is that?
oh , i picked up a few things on the way home .
it's an area rug .
do you love it?
yes .
how much was it?
it doesn't seem to cover much of an area .
it was $200 or something like that .
i don't really remember .
that was 200 bucks?
yeah , but , you know , it's a runner ,
'cause it goes in between the two rooms and then ties them together .
ooh , and look !
look , look , look , look , look !
it's an original pablo flinch .
really?
cool .
is it , like , a mayan guacamole bowl or something?
it's a stool .
here .
try it .
what are we , hobbits?
it's a water stain !
i told mr. rose the problem with the pipes this morning .
they were going bang bang bangity bang bang .
bang .
bang .
yeah , the whole bathroom could have explode .
471 bucks .
what time?
you were here three hours?
yeah .
sweetie , these were original tiles .
how could you not hear banging?
sweetie , i was asleep !
napping , and in the middle of the afternoon .
shameful .
i'm not gonna pay for unauthorized repairs .
i did the work , my friend .
i can rip the pipes out of the wall .
what?
i don't know what you're saying .
do it !
do it !
you do it .
you do it .
alex !
what?
okay , forget it .
plug it up .
i begged mr. rose to do something .
i was terrified , nancy .
okay , well , the next time that happens ,
mrs. connelly , just call me , okay?
i gave you my business card .
alan , before i forget , it's the first of the month .
right . $88 .
do you want to count it?
remember , if she bothers you , just lay down the law .
be firm , but nice .
two positives , then a negative .
what is that?
psychology .
don't wait up for me .
i got to work late .
i love you .
i love you .
good morning , alex .
good morning , mrs. connelly .
i wondered if i could ask you a quick question .
right .
you know what?
can i just say this to you?
you know i'm working on a book , right?
and this book is due in about three weeks .
and my editor is expecting it on her desk at that time , okay?
it's a contractual deadline .
i see .
so i have to be working on that book all the time here in my apartment , which is also my office .
it's just like my office .
if i was a lawyer , and i went off to an office , you couldn't knock on my door , 'cause you wouldn't be there .
so let's just pretend that i'm a lawyer , okay?
this is my office , and unless it's a really , really super important emergency , okay , between the hours of 9 : 00 and 6 : 00 , i'm not here .
i'm off , away in my office , okay?
and then after 6 : 00 , i'm here , okay?
i completely understand .
and i apologize for bothering you .
not at all .
okay , have a good day , all right?
it's just ...
what?
what is it just?
what is it?
i bought a copy of your book yesterday , and i wondered if you'd sign it .
of course , if you're too busy ,
i can come back out of business hours .
oh .
no .
that ... no .
oh , that's so nice .
you didn't have to buy a copy .
i have a million copies .
it's money well spent .
just write something that i can treasure for years to come .
okay .
how about , " to my favorite upstairs neighbor "?
signed " alex rose .
here you go .
and i hope you like it .
oh , i know i will .
okay .
all right .
good day .
alex?
yeah?
i know we've just had this discussion , but i was wondering if the firm of rose & rose could accompany an old lady to the pharmacy .
it's pissing down out there .
and i need to renew my monthlies .
it won't take any time at all .
30 , 31 , 32 , 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 ...
how much is the nicorette? $43 . 97 .
i lost me place .
one , two , three ... 8 , 9 , 10 ... 1 , 2 , 3 ... 22 , 23 , 24 ... 25 , 26 , 27 , 28 , 29 , and 30 .
okay , good?
oh , blueberries .
1 , 2 , 3 ...
i thought you were gonna talk to her .
i did , honey .
i did .
i was very clear with her .
she's just ...
she manipulated me somehow .
she manipulated you?
she's very crafty .
she's a crafty old lady .
well , i'll tell you what .
tomorrow's gonna be better , because you know why?
it's gonna be saturday , and that's our day off , and we're gonna get to sleep in .
okay?
yeah .
i promise everything will be better tomorrow , okay?

the one that was big dick's favorite , too .
there's a boy .
from your kindred and all
from the campfire at night
we'll hear the wild dingoes call
but there's nothing so ionesome so dull , or so drear
than to stand in the bar of a pub with no beer
now the publican's anxious
holy crap !
ah , ha , ha , ha , ha
mrs. connelly?
with a thrill in my hand and a pill on my tongue
dissolve the nerves that have just begun

the third fireplace .
wow .
this apartment is amazing .
i'm so glad that you like it .
whew .
relief .
wonderful collection .

how's the ending turning out?
the ending is gonna be great .
i'm kind of circling it 'cause i don't want to force it .
just make sure you turn it in by wednesday .
management's being very strict with all our mid level authors .
i'm only mid level?
right now .
of course , you won't be after you hand in your masterpiece .
we're replacing most of the furniture we have , but we're going for a miller/ eames look .
you love eames , terrence .
i just got a new piece .
did you bring that guy with the girl in the leopard thing?
oh , that's chick .
that's the guy who's advising me on the don piper mysteries .
what , is he a detective or something?
no .
he's a hired gun .
he kills people for a living .
you brought a hit man into the party?
relax .
he's very discreet .
he's got a perfectly legitimate day job as a cover .
and what do you do , chick?
i'm a pornographer .
here , let me give you a card , you know , just in case .
she's this funny old irish lady named mrs. connelly , and she's actually in a brass ensemble at the church tonight .
there's all sorts of incredible details .
i mean , i can't wait for you guys to see it .
it's beautiful .
ooh , herman , get in here .
herman?
being a landlord doesn't give you the right to enter your tenant's premises anytime you feel like it .
i just wanted my friends to have a look see .
you were supposed to be at the church performing .
heavens no .
it's next friday .
we've got a big week of practice ahead of us .
you terrified the poor woman .
mrs. connelly , you can press charges if you want .
no , i don't want to do that .
they're such a nice couple .
good night , now .
good night , mrs. connelly .
i'm gonna be watching the two of you very closely .
hey , alex , right?
hey , chick .
how you doing?
brought you a housewarming gift .
oh , that's so sweet .
well , look , this is very tasteful stuff .
you know , for couples .
that is so thoughtful .
thank you .
my card's inside " ass patrol , " in case you need more .
take it easy .
thanks for the party .
okay .
i got an award for this one .
she was supposed to be at church .
you can't fire me because you got maced .
believe me .
i wish that's why i was firing you .
did you happen to see the restaurant hot list?
oh , my god .
so ...
how's mr. peabody doing?
alex?
oh .
oh , no , no , no .
there's no napping right now .
you have to finish your book .
we need money .
i got fired .
yeah , i know .
i saw it .
oh , you saw it .
yeah .
it's horrible .
my parents read this magazine .
now they know my penis is called mr. peabody .
it wasn't my fault .
she was calling me when you were napping .
i wasn't napping , for the 1, 000th time !
okay , maybe i took a nap at one point .
when did napping become against the law?
honey , i can't work here .
it's impossible .
i've been trying .
i've written three pages in the last six weeks .
three pages .
the book is due on wednesday .
if we don't hand in the book , i don't know what we're gonna do .
we can't pay for anything .
the runners , the stools .
we can't pay for the tangelo bowl you like .
we can't pay for your little happy mug vase thing .
well , what if you got out of the house and went to write at , like , a starbucks or something?
and what?
you're gonna stay here and try to find work while she has you running around doing things for her?
doing all the little errands , the chores she asks you to do?
i don't think you could take it .
i mean , i love you , but , honestly ,
i've been there , and i don't think you could take it .
i can take it .
i'll be fine .
nancy?
hello , mrs. connelly .
nancy , dear .
i couldn't help noticing that alex left the house this morning while you stayed home .
i was downsized from my job .
aw , i'm sorry .
but i'm sure it's for the best .
let mr. rose get out there and bring home the bacon .
i always thought it was strange .
a husband staying home while you were out there providing .
well , he's a writer .
writer .
the man naps more than a newborn pup .
what's he writing about?
sheep?
is there something , mrs. connelly?
oh , i guess you could say there was something .
i've got something on display in me kitchen .
that is not a mouse dropping .
it's a raisin .
that is the leavings of a mouse .
it's a raisin .
i sprayed it with lysol .
ohh .
and she puts on this sweet face , and she acts all innocent .
nancy , could you help me?
i think i found the leavings of a mouse .
as if she didn't know it was a raisin .
i know .
i've never designed religious leaflets , per se .
1 : 00 .
great , rabbi .
thank you so much .
nancy?
okay .
nancy?
nancy?
are you down there?
what is it , mrs. connelly?
little dickey's caught in the dumbwaiter shaft .
well , how did he get there?
aaah !
oh , don't hurt him .
oh , ooh , dickey boy .
oh , careful .
aah !
shame on you .
scaring a helpless , little macaw like that .
scaring a helpless , little macaw like that .
this is not going well .
i told you she's a mean , crafty old lady .
at this rate , i'm never gonna finish the book in time .
damn rent control .
i wish we could just kick her out .
what if we tried being nice to her?
maybe we could get her a gift .
a gift?
yeah .
and ask her if she wouldn't mind leaving .
we ask her?
yeah .
just ask her?
maybe it'll take a little begging , but nicely .
well , she might go for begging .
there's a chart that shows what's inside of each chocolate .
that's all right , dear .
mrs. connelly , let me come right to the point .
alex and i are trying to have a baby .
i saw .
in the living room .
right .
the thing is , when we do have our baby , we're gonna need the upstairs .
i don't understand , dear .
we're willing to pay you something .
you want me to leave?
don't you think you'd be more comfortable with people who are more in your demographic?
in sunny miami beach .
i'm irish .
i'd sizzle up like a sausage .
besides , this is my home .
home .
the emerald isle , hmm?
back to the old sod .
well , now , there's a thought .
i haven't been back home for 50 years .
ooh .
a caramel .
so , about ireland .
and you moving there .
most likely they have television now?
oh .
of course they do .
yeah , color .
i've made up me mind .
i'll do ...
mrs. connelly !
she's choking !
oh , god !
mrs. connelly .

oh , god !
ooh , alex !
alex !
come on !
come on !
yeah , good .
come on !
come on !
whew !
oh , my god !
oh !

alex , what are you doing?
cpr !
wait !

stop it !
oh , god .
one , two , three , four , five .
okay , give her mouth to mouth .
oh , no .
really?
yes .
yes , do it !
okay .
no , you got to blow in her mouth .
come on .
one breath , come on .
one , two , three , four , five .
okay , again .
okay , one breath .
that's it .
one , two , three , four , five .
again !
oh .
what are you doing?
you were choking on a chocolate .
you choked on a chocolate .
oh .
oh .
oh .
go on , mrs. connelly .
the last thing i remember , i ate one of their chocolates .
and when i woke up , he was having his way .
and she was holding me down .
no , i was trying to save her life .
he stole me drawers once for sniffing .
that's ridiculous .
she was choking on the chocolate , so i did ...
shut up !
we keep a list of people like you down here at the station .
the sexual predator list .
sexual predator?
and to think they want to have children .
we should've just let her choke .
oh , i know .
what can i get you?
listen , i got 12 hours to finish this book .
i was wondering if i could sit here and write all day .
be my guest .
thanks .
nancy .
i was going to ring you .
i'm afraid there's a bit of a problem up here .
i have to go on a job interview , so i'll take care of it later .
oh , that's okay .
i'll ring the rug man .
good .
knock it in .
knock it in good .
i don't want to slip and break me neck .
no , we wouldn't want that .
this is the problem area here .
it's loose as a dublin whore .
oh , go on , knock it in .
yes !
now , just knock it in .
go on , knock .
come on , use some elbow grease .
aah !
okay , i will .
you threw her down the stairs?
no .
but i imagined it .
and i liked it .
i'm evil .
i'm a horrible , horrible person .
thank you .
come on , she's practically ruined our lives .
it's natural to have thoughts like that .
really?
yeah .
i mean , i've even had a couple .
aaaah !
like what?
just , you know , snapping her neck or electrocuting her .
you know , just beating her to death , decapitating her , drowning her , just , you know , bludgeoning her , in a humane way , but ...
dicing her up into little , little pieces .
but asphyxiating her first so she didn't feel anything .
i'm glad you clarified that .
you're evil , too .
i'm finished .
that's what i am .
and it was incredible .
the last 60 pages just poured out of me .
let's open that really great champagne and celebrate .
alex? !
alex? !
nancy? !
ooh !
come quick .
a huge rat just ran under me cupboard .
oh , come .
come on , quick .
quick , alex !
i'll pop the cork .
i'll be right back .
are you sure it was a rat , mrs. connelly?
i saw its face .
you saw its face?
all right , let's see if we can't find this big , bad rat .
you sure it might not have been a dust bunny?
'cause sometimes they look rodent like .
aah !
the rat !
where?
there !
oh .
oh , that's not a rat .
that's like a little field mouse .
alan !
your purse fell into the fire .
oh , no .
alan !
oh , don't !
oh , don't !
my book !
ow !
oh , alan !
oh !
oh !
you'll burn yourself !

okay .
oh !

oh , my god !
oh !
no !

alex !
stop !
no , stop !
aah !
no !
no !
i swear she did that on purpose .
and now here's tonight's health watch .
a deadly virus has hit new york city .
doctors warn that this particular strain is extremely dangerous in children under 5 and especially to the elderly .
symptoms include high fever ,
symptoms include high fever , accompanied by nausea and violent diarrhea .
mr. rose?
would you sprinkle some salt on the steps?
they're terribly icy .
you better not go outside then .
ow !
ow !
mother ...
a giant tow truck runs it over , followed by an s. u. v. that it was dragging .
alex , that's horrible .
i know .
i know .
can you believe it?
no , i can't .
i tried to warn you , alex .
we're canceling every contract that's in breach .
in breach?
i have the crushed powerbook .
i'm sorry , darling .
if you put as much energy into your work as you do into excuses , you might have made the deadline .
do you have the shark?
yes , we do .
excellent .
i'm gonna have that , no bones .
hi .
how do you feel?
like i'm knocking on death's door .
well , look who's here .
come in , both of you .
hi , mrs. connelly .
happy thanksgiving .
oh , thank you .
how are you?
oh , i'm grand .
but how are the two of you?
you look rather sallow .
no , no .
we're fine .
we brought you some popcorn .
oh .
oh , how lovely .
i adore popcorn .
so does little dick .
so , did you have a nice thanksgiving dinner?
oh , yes , dear .
that lovely italian lady in the post office brought me a sumptuous dinner .
the only problem is some of the carcass didn't go down the disposal .
that's 'cause you don't have a disposal .
i don't?
it's really stuffed up .
all right !
if you ask me , you two have got some sort of bug .
thank god officer dan took me to have a flu shot last week .
upchuck is a delicacy for little dick .
he's salivating .
he's salivating .
how much can we get , kenneth?
that depends on how far you're willing to drop the price .
first of all , you way overpaid .
and then you got that tenant .
you said she was a sweet old lady .
oh , i can't imagine those words coming out of my mouth .
so you're saying that we're stuck in this hellhole?
yeah .
unless you're willing to take a huge , huge loss .
how huge?
huge , huge .
we're just totally screwed , right?
yeah .
i would say screwed is apt .
do you think that jean would ever give you a second chance?
no .
no , it's over .
besides , how could i have time to rewrite my novel and still do my faithful servant duty to her as her little indentured servant person , her little butt boy?
i mean , i got a lot of duties .
'cause she might need me to count grapes with her or help her fix her heater or go take her to the laundry .
or i gotta go help her clean her banana skins and i gotta go help her clean out her garbage or go and wipe her ass !
god forbid she should have any shit hanging off her ass !
alex .
no .
really .
'cause then i gotta run like a little bunny and i have to go up there and i gotta go wipe her little ass .
and then i have to go , " oh , good for you , mrs. connelly , for having such a nice , little poopy .
you got some poopy on your diapie?
ooh , let me go and clean it off with my tongue !
excuse me , sir .
i mean , enough is enough !
excuse me .
off we go , dickey boy .
okay .
okay , come on .
we don't have that much time .
i know .
she's running errands .
that only gives us 12 hours .
you , there .
me , there .
a little salt in her sugar bowl .
hey , come check this out !
roger .
alex?
tripped on the rug .
i'm all right .
you sure you know what you're doing?
i rewired the lamp in your office .
cool .
'cause if the shock doesn't get her , a little bit of gas poisoning should .
out goes pilot one .
out goes pilot two .
an hour at 375 ought to do it .
did you remember to blow out the pilot for the oven?
oh .
honey .
alex .
the stain is dripping on us .
i know .
isn't it soothing?
alex .
hi .
we got a water stain downstairs , so i got to look at the pipes .
what has happened to your face?
oh , i just fell asleep in one of those tanning machines .
you look like a roast mutton .
how are you doing , mutton head?
i'm almost done .
ah !
on the average , she gets up to change the channel 19 times a night walking this 48 inch footpath .
by the time she gets to the back end of that " hawaii five o " marathon , the acid should have eaten through the floorboards .
and we'll finally be happy .
it wasn't our fault , officer dan .
you should find the plumber .
right?
right .
you know , we might want to get a hotel room just in case .
sweetie , now that we have a hole in the ceiling ,
i thought maybe it could be a new place for the staircase to go .
yeah .
looks good .
where are you going?
a little insurance .
alex , no !
not mr. peacock .
honey , mr. peacock's gonna have to take one for the team , okay?
that's it .
she's watching " riverdance .
i didn't know people still watched " riverdance .
you know , this is actually harder than it looks .
holy mary and joseph !
i could have fallen right through .
the floorboards here , they're rotten to the core .
awhile back she hired this russian guy to fix the pipes .
and i don't know if you noticed , but there's all this water damage that he left .
with all due respect to mr. " d " , alex , you were up here yourself fiddling with me pipes a few days ago .
fiddling with her pipes , huh?
now , that's another fine right there .
for what?
you can't plumb without a license in new york city .
plumb?
i can't plumb?
are you sassing me , mr. rose?
he's not sassing you .
yeah , no , i'm not sassing you .
i'm not .
i didn't think so .
'cause i know a city building inspector that eats chickenshit slumlords like you for lunch .
you got it?
i get it .
you know , slumlord ...
and you're gonna buy miss connelly a brand new tv .
in fact , miss connelly , i'm gonna pick it out myself .
oh !
could you get one of those clappy things?
it makes my viewing so much easier .
it makes my viewing so much easier .
smoke .
smoke , smoke .
mesca .
loot , loot .
gun?
what?
gun .
gun?
gun?
so this is what it's come to?
i guess so .
i don't think i've ever held a gun be ...
i think i've got everything i need here .
we've got an unlicensed gun charge , and then pending an investigation ...
it was an accident .
it's my experience that wives don't accidently shoot their husbands in the penis .
and as much as this particular man might deserve it , spousal abuse is a very serious crime in this state .
you two have a good night now .
he thinks you're abusing me .
well , you did shoot me .
you're very lucky .
your hand deflected the bullet away from the tissue of the actual organ and just nicked the scrotum .
what about the , you know , the berries?
oh .
wake up , wake up , wake up , wake up
oh , baby , now , let's get down tonight
you feel that?
yes .
mm hmm .
that's good .
okay .
i'm gonna run a few more tests , but i think you should be out of here by tomorrow .
poor mr. peabody .
he took one for the team .
i just think that we're going about this murder thing all wrong .
you think? !
maybe we should just keep it simple .
maybe we should just keep it simple .
this is so not simple .
yeah , but you know she triple chain iocks the front door at night .
a little more , a little more .
okay .
where is she?
maybe she's in her chair .
you caught me .
i can't help but sneak a fag once in a blue moon .
we ...
we thought that you might be cold , so we brought you an extra pillow .
oh , such consideration .
so unlike the other landlords .
many have passed through the dwelling below , but i just know you two have come to stay .
officer dan put in me new television .
52 inches .
and he gave me these noise boxes , there and by me chair .
so it's like i'm in the cinema .
oh , it's going to be so wonderful here .
you two lovelies ... me ...
officer dan .
we're going to be one big , happy family .
the irish have a saying that it's unlucky to come in one door and go out of another .
something to do with the dead .
evil spirits and the like .
good night now .
do you know what , dears?
i think i've enough warmth as it is .
night .
that was , without question , the weirdest 7 minutes of my life .
captain connelly battled waves twice the size of that !
didn't he , little dick?
we're just gonna be one big , happy family !
what? !
is it us? !
are we doing such a bad job of trying to kill her? !
it's not our fault !
she's a freak of nature !
hey !
i thought you were supposed to get rid of these .
i did !
it's strange .
i don't know how that got there .
yeah , right .
ass patrol " !
hand me that " ass patrol .
now , depending on her mood , she could be watching tv over here or sneaking a cigarette over there .
i realize this is just horribly cluttered .
when we get in there , we're gonna go for a cleaner look .
it's ...
sorry .
what's the easiest way into this hag's place?
well , we found the dumbwaiter to be rather effective .
yeah , and you really don't have to pull that hard to climb it .
you know , we could even leave the back door open for you .
so , chick , how much is this gonna set us back?
25k .
o ... 2 ...
okay .
'cause we had had a slightly different figure in our heads .
we were thinking maybe something a little closer to , like ... half a " k.
the bottom line price for wet work is $25, 000 .
okay .
when do you think you could do it?
i'll do it thursday night .
christmas eve?
yeah .
i got a little function .
then i'll swing by .
put the cash in the dumbwaiter .
got it?
got it .
okay .
cool .
don't forget your computer .
thank you so much .
good night .
okay , now all we need is $25, 000 .
piper grabbed the leash of the only partner he'd ever known , and the private eye and his jack russell headed downtown .
'i guess it's just one of those things worth killing for , huh? " '
we'll take a break and come back for some q& a.
dental surgery . $25, 000? !
the thing is , with nancy losing her job , and with the mortgage and now with me losing my book contract , things have gotten desperate , and i wouldn't even be asking if it wasn't serious .
did you get the money?
no .
he didn't think i needed it .
but i did get a nice , new , signed first edition for my collection .
he wrote it in 4 days .
want to know how?
listen to this .
let's see .
her hair was bright yellow
like the color of your pee after you take a multivitamin .
it's a nice metaphor , asshole !
stupid , freaking asshole !
i hate you and your stupid don piper mystery and your stupid pregnant wife who's gonna have a little baby that has a freaking six pack because its mother never eats !
honey .
honey , we're gonna get that money .
how?
how are we gonna get $25, 000 in two days?
it's beginning to look a lot like christmas
no .
not mr. peacock .
take a look in the five and ten
glistening once again
with candy canes and silver lanes aglow
it's beginning to look a lot like christmas
christmas
toys in every store
ooh
but the prettiest sight to see
is the holly that will be
on your own front door
jingle bells , jingle bells
jingle all the way
oh , what fun it is to ride
in a one horse open sleigh , hey !
jingle bells , jingle bells
jingle all the way
oh , what fun it is to ride ...
jingle bells , jingle bells
jingle all the way
oh , what fun it is to ride ...
merry christmas !
that's good , kids .
that is good .
now , you save those voices for the neighbors , okay?
officer dan , what a pleasant surprise .
what can we do for you?
i have cookies i want to take to miss connelly .
oh , okay .
oh , that's nice .
no .
i'll take them up myself .
i'll bring them up for you .
if you don't mind ...
i don't ...
i don't think she's even up there .
she's not , so you should just leave it at the door .
hey !
cut that out .
stop it .
hey !
stop it !
what the heck is going on?
there are kids here .
i knew there was domestic abuse in this house .
i'm gonna come back in 10 minutes .
come on , kids .
let's go .
good save .
i knew they'd send a brute .
aah !
you shot me !
i've got you , you brute !
who are ya , bringing a knife to a gunfight?
let go of me !
what's he doing?
he's doing his job .
if you want to dance with me , you've gotta buy me a drink first .
is that smoke? !
get off me , you crazy bitch !
wait , wait .
what?
what?
here we go .
you all right?
yeah .
where's little dickey?
dickey , dickey .
here you go .
here , here .
oh , dick .
dickey .
hello .
never thought you had it in you .
thank god i bought that fire extinguisher .
we were just trying to help her out .
her and little dickey .
i'll just write this citation up for electricity .
thank you .
thanks .
thank you .
thanks .
believe it or not , i need two more autographs , and that will be it .
so how's the new place?
it's cute .
i'll tell you , the bronx is an up and coming borough .
you didn't lie , kenneth .
it all looks incredible .
i told you they'd fix it up , didn't i?
friedmans , meet alex and nancy .
hi .
hey .
we can't thank you enough .
this is just a dream house .
it's so quiet .
honey , won't this be perfect for your sleep disorder?
i'm drowsy already .
hey , who wants to run upstairs and say hello?
well , we should get going .
we should .
we have to ...
yeah .
nonsense !
you pulled the woman out of a burning building .
you'd break her heart if you didn't say goodbye .
come on !
mrs. connelly , i brought you a surprise !
mrs. connelly !
the hearing on this one .
look who's here .
she's asleep .
sweetheart .
she's stiff as a board .
no .
she's just hard of hearing .
mrs. connelly !
she's dead .
oh , poor thing .
no .
she can't be dead .
i guess it was just her time .
come on , i'll call the friedmans .
you don't have to stay here for this .
come .
come , come , come .
must have been all the excitement .
i can't believe it .
she was so full of life .
i mean , for all our differences , that old lady really had a lot of spunk .
a lot of it .
do you think she's up in heaven?
well , i'll tell you something .
wherever she is , she's in a better place .
you should have seen their faces when i said she was a goner .
so cheap , though i wish i could have been there .
trust me .
it wasn't easy holding me breath all that long .
next time , i want a bigger cut of your commission , kenny .
what are you talking about?
we give you everything , ma .
there's barely enough left for danny and i to have a cruise to the caribbean .
i'm the one putting me caboose on the line .
oh , come on .
you had it easy with alex and nancy .
they were a nice couple .
i do hope they'll be all right .
ah , they'll be fine .
he's a writer .
they thrive on adversity .
i hope his next book is better than his last one .
maybe this time he'll write about something he knows .
alex and nancy's dream house may have been too good to be true .
but did they live happily ever after?
well , read the book .
