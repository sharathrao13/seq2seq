yoshimi ... no one's come for you?
yoshimi matsubara
well , your husband has no objections on the division of property .
so it's ... our daughter?
yes .
he's absolutely insistent on beingthe legal guardian .
why is he sayingthis now?
he has completely neglected her from the beginning .
perhaps it's just that you've never noticed .
he may ...
no , that's not it at all .
he forgets her birthday every year .
where are you living?
presently i'm looking for a place for my daughter and me .
but i'll be deciding this week .
just a small question .
sure .
ls it true you had once received psychiatric treatment?
did he tell you that?
yes .
that was before we were married .
over 10years ago now .
i was working proofreading novels at the time , and ...
you mean correcting spelling mistakes , that sort of thing?
right .
and some of the novels lwas working on then ... were extremely graphic and sadistic .
so it was a distraction to your work .
no you see , the content was just so horrible ... and i had to read them over and over again .
so that's when you started going for treatment?
yes .
i see .
ls that goingto ...?
no , that shouldn't present a problem .
you know i ... haven't been at all since then .
don't worry about it .
and unless something major occurs , the mother usually has the advantage when the child is under seven .
right .
my being seen before ... that doesn't matter anymore .
hey , a fact is a fact .
what's wrong with speaking the truth?
i don't think it will get you very far now .
go straight along the river .
right here?
thank you very much .
tired?
this will be the last one , ok?
alright , i'm going on ahead ...
lkuko
what do you think this room's for?
that's where you eat .
how about this one?
where you sleep?
how about this little room here?
that's my room !
ok , i'm off to see lkuko's room !
bye !
hey !
howmany floors?
gee , i don't know ...
can you count them?
one , two , three , four , fiive ...
so what do you think?
areal bargain , i'd say .
we'll think about it .
thank you .
ms. matsubara?
yes .
come right in .
please , come in .
the apartment manager lives here too .
so you can feel safe coming home at night .
disappointed?
it is alittle old .
but it's built solid , you know .
please .
mr. kamiya ,
i told you to wipe this up .
sorry , a bucket of water spilled earlier .
after you .
which way?
here we are .
go right in .
how old are you , lkuko?
tell him how old you are .
almost six .
oh , you're in kindergarten .
yup !
where's my room?
how about this one here?
yey !
the kindergarten is really close .
and next week we're having the wallpaper replaced .
then it will look as good as new .
the humidity in here is unreal .
well , with all the rain we've had ...
most people use this room as a bedroom .
oh , right ...
i haven't shown you the kitchen .
please .
we're having the kitchen done over too .
you'll fiind it very easy to use .
you know the other family also liked the room .
the early bird catches the worm .
i see .
it's just the two of you , right?
yes .
oh , then there's plenty of room !
a real steal .
lkuko?
lkuko?
maybe she went outside?
i'm going to go check .
lkuko?
excuse me , has my little girl been here?
we haven't seen her .
really ...
baron , have you seen her?
he says he hasn't either .
lkuko !
that's ... my daughter !
what floor was that?
can't tell .
they all look the same .
lkuko?
lkuko !
mommy !
what were you doing?
i was looking all over for you .
where did you get this?
it was lying on the ground .
where?
over there .
there aren't any kids living here now .
well maybe some kids came over to play .
your lucky day .
no .
she can't have these .
we don't know who they belong to .
careful now , hon .
no problem !
lost and found
mine !
hey !
come back here !
you silly !
the sound really carries , huh .
yeah , it really carries .
got tabe careful , huh .
yeah , careful !
what the ...
count 10 times each tooth now .
yup , i am !
chee ze !
chee ze !
everyone , i'd like to introduce ... our new friend , lkuko matsubara .
hi , i'm lkuko matsubara .
i think we can do better than that !
alright !
pleased to meet you !
nice job !
what floor , ma'am?
first floor , please .
certainly .
what's ...
hello?
excuse me .
there's water leaking from our ceiling .
i'm yoshimi matsubara , just moved into rm .
305 .
there's a wet spot on my ceiling , and water dripping down from it .
well the building is very old , you see .
so it gets a little rickety .
ok , and so ...?
i'll make a note of it in the log .
ok , everyone !
quiet and listen up now .
i want to introduce our newest friend on her fiirst day !
can you tell us your name?
hi , i'm lkuko matsubara !
now let's all be good friends with lkuko , ok?
ok !
please .
thank you .
we believe in giving children the freedom to do what they desire .
this is our basic educational philosophy .
all our kids are really outgoing .
lkuko will make friends in no time .
thank you .
not at all .
oh , thank you .
thank you .
please .
sir , kobajashi's here .
i hear you called ms. tsushima " stupid "?
come on , you're almost in first grade now .
you said it to kusano and uesugi , right?
that ms. tsushima was stupid .
why is she " stupid "?
what was it you said ...
ms. tsushimais stupid because she's fat .
right?
what's that all about?
everyone overweight is " stupid "?
well?
what are you crying for? !
kobajashi !
yes , why?
you think it's our fault?
well , it's nobody's but your own !
hello?
hello?
the place may be old , but i really doubt that's the cause .
i think it's a plumbing leak from somewhere above us .
maybe the room right above you ...
that's what i thought , so i went up and checked .
but no one answered ...
all done .
ok , i'll tell the apartment manager myself tomorrow .
no , you see ... he won't lift a fiinger , that's why i called you .
but i'm not involved with management , you see .
but water is ... dripping down from my ceiling .
ok , see you tomorrow !
sorry to keep you waiting , i was a little tied up .
where were we ...
oh yes , yoshimi matsubara .
you have previous experience , correct?
i worked up until six years ago .
right , right ...
at sanyu publishing ... quite a large company .
as you can tell , we're quite small .
why did you leave sanyu?
i got married and then had a child .
oh right , right .
are you sure you'd be happy here?
the pay wouldn't be as high , you know .
well , i'm in a situation right now where ...
i really want to start working soon .
of course ,
i don't mean taking a job just anywhere ...
that's alright .
i understand .
mr. kono !
coming !
excuse me again .
sorry about this .
what is it?
bye , now .
thank you .
there's mommy .
hello?
who's picking up yoshimi?
she's been waiting all alone for ...
what?
you can't just ... !
so who's coming to pick her up today?
i see .
yoshimi
today , daddy's coming to get you .
so just a little bit longer , ok?
what about mommy?
mommy?
well , she ...
sir , what can i say?
tomorrow is just too early for us to ...
ms. matsubara?
oh yes , i worked at ...
sanyu until i had my daughter six years ago .
my job was proofreading , and i look forward ... to working with you .
right ...
hey , wait a second ...
ms. matsubara !
lkuko
lkuko ...
have you seen this child?
mitsuko kawai , born 11/ 3/ 93 , 4'5 " , 45lbs . , long black hair .
last seen 7/ 14/ 99 , wearing a hooded yellow raincoat .
lkuko !
mommy !
what are you doing !
i had no choice !
you didn't pick her up !
stay out of this .
waiting there all alone ...
do you know how that feels? !
come on .
let's go .
it's so pretty .
it is , isn't it !
want to try?
let's get some on the way home .
where should we do them?
we'd get in trouble on the balcony , huh .
mommy?
i don't need anyone but you .
did daddy say something to you?
i'm sorry , hon .
you know what?
i can handle anything , just as long as you're with me .
you have one new message .
this is mr. kono from mitsuba publishing .
i'm really sorry for all the commotion today at your interview .
anyway i was thinking , if you'd like , we could have you start tomorrow proofreading .
no !
what?
i just got a job !
really?
alright !
you did it !
top floor , ma'am?
please !
fourth floor toys .
going up !
ok !
come on !
no !
lkuko , don't
ow !
that hurts !
there ! lwin !
but that's notyours , mitsuko .
no fair .
what?
i like this one , so i'll give you this one here .
you like it?
lkuko , turn off the water and come on out .
but she loves the bath ...
we've been in here so long .
come on now , time to come out .
ok , let's play hide and seek !
yey !
once , twice , three ...
rock , paper , scissors !
ok , mao's " it " !
one ... two ... three ... four ...
hey , can i ...
this is our spot .
hide over there .
i'm ready !
what happened?
well ...
she " threw up and collapsed "?
that's never happened before .
you probably forced her to do something .
not at all ...
youtwo ...
just what have you done to my child !
we haven't done anything .
but ...
try and calm down .
come on , let's talk .
it seems that lately , lkuko has been behaving oddly .
apparently she talks to herself alot .
i also hear you're divorced .
that must be affecting her .
we see this alot with children of divorced parents .
come home soon , mitsuko
as a matter of fact , she used to behave oddly too .
however in mitsuko's case , her mother had abandoned her .
just got up and left one day .
you never heard of her?
the girl who disappeared two years ago .
mitsuko kawai .
she was one of our kids here .
ls she ... still missing?
yes .
i think she was kidnapped by some perverted individual .
excuse me?
apparently you're late picking up lkuko almost every day .
almost every day "?
that's an exaggeration ...
oh?
well , sometimes ...
i get there late because of work , but really ...
every day " ... who told you that?
and is it true you yanked her arm and dislocated her shoulder?
dislocated it?
why no ... of course not !
and how about wandering around aimlessly at night?
do you deny this?
i was a child then .
my parents had divorced .
apparently i did such things without realizing it .
but it was only for a short period .
and i can assure you that would never happen now .
lf the mother can't show she can raise the child ...
stop exaggerating everything !
what are you talking about? !
don't deny it !
please , let's remain calm .
who is he !
i'm mr. hamada's private lawyer masato nishioka ...
using a guy like this ... as your personal spy !
hey , i'm just worried about lkuko .
since when?
i don't care how you rationalize it ... stop playing dirty !!
please , both of you .
we needto set the next date .
right .
sorry .
so it was you ...
and the bag ... you put it there .
what?
the red bag , on the roof !
why did you do that? !
what are you talking about !
why? !
ms. matsubara !
take it easy !
let's go inside , mr. hamdada .
are you alright?
i take it ... you're still in the middle of mediations .
lf you let them see you like this , they'll think you're unstable , which can only hurt you .
my secretary's off today , so this may be a little strong .
woops !
forgot the cream and sugar .
lf they take her away from me ...
i ...
your husband seems pretty serious .
he could move against you anywhere , anytime .
they say with children under seven , the mother has the advantage .
but if you continue along this path , growing weaker by the day , it will be nearly impossible for you to gain custody .
ln any case , now is the most critical time .
lf you want to continue living with your daughter , the fiirst thing you need to do is pull yourself together .
right ...
come on , we can't get very far like that now .
it'll be alright .
let's fight this together .
thank you .
did she eat her lunch?
sure did .
girls are just the cutest things .
auntie , leaving already?
yup , have to stop off at the store .
you know how he leaves it all to me .
sorry , i know it's far ...
you're the only one i can ask .
that's ok .
you've done well with lkuko .
a far cry from the mother you had .
she just couldn't think of anyone but herself ...
ok , see ya .
thanks .
bye .
thanks .
lkuko ...
lkuko
lkuko !
lkuko ...
mommy !
lkuko ...
lkuko
lkuko?
are you there?
it's me ... ls lkuko with you?
no .
don't lie .
i wouldn't lie about that !
why , what happened?
yoshimi !
what's going on? !
lkuko !
lku ... lkuko !
hello !
open up !
hello !
lkuko , are you in there?
lkuko?
lkuko ...
lkuko?
are you here?
lkuko?
lkuko !
shoji and mitsuko kawai
mitsuko kawai ...
may i come in?
sure .
what are you doing?
we're moving out .
so lkuko will ... have to change kindergarten again?
that's right .
why not wait a while?
i can't .
ms. matsubara , ... you know we're at a disadvantage as it stands .
lf you move again now , think of how the committee will view this .
i don't want to hear that now !
mitsuko has returned to the apartment upstairs , and she's trying to take lkuko away !
so the room upstairs was open ...
i realize you're busy , ... but i'd like you to see this .
what the ...?
mr. kamiya !
but i locked it ...
wow , you were right ...
what in the name of ...
the family of that girl who disappeared ... when did they move out?
well , let's see ... the end of last year , wasn't it?
the father lived here for a while by himself .
said his little girl would have no place to come home to .
which means , the water in here may have been running for the past six months .
mr. kamiya
ms. matsubara complained to you about this , didn't she?
did you look into it?
mr. kamiya
there are alot of people in line for your job .
alot of people to replace you .
mr. ohta
i believe she also called you .
we'll ...
i'm uh ...
well ... what about the footsteps i heard?
well , we know lkuko was in here .
so someone else could have gotten in too .
the bag was lying right here .
did you throw it away again?
well , i threw it away once .
but that's all i know .
so it's disappeared ...
maybe part of some superstition .
either way , it must be the local kids .
look how dirty this thing is ...
do you have it cleaned?
that's the cleaning company's job .
i can go now , right?
woops ...
think he's upset?
and then right over there ,
i saw someone .
did you get a clear look?
it was just for an instant , but i saw something .
but i'll bet no one was there when you checked .
well , yes ...
see the highway over there?
and the neon sign on that building .
this water tank is exposed to light from all around .
so if something passed in front of the light , it would cast a shadow on the tank .
then it would be natural for your eyes to play tricks on you .
although , coming up here all alone at night and seeing what you saw ... that would scare anyone .
your husband's lawyer has also looked this over , and has agreed to the terms .
i don't think this will compromise your position at all .
thank you .
just remember , this is simply a set of legal points worked out by lawyers .
so just continue with your daily routine , and try to remain focused .
i will .
hey , you're just about there .
lkuko .
ready to go back to school?
sure !
well , you sure seem better !
i would ... really like to thank you for all you've done .
by myself , i was so confused ...
not at all .
i can see lkuko needs you .
and that you need her .
that's all .
i can see now that i need to be stronger .
but it's not over yet .
the fiinal decision will probably be made at the next session .
ln any case , even if something happens before then , don't act alone .
contact me immediately .
i will .
one , two , three !
all auntie makes is okayu rice .
hey come on , you were sick .
it's good though , isn't it?
i like this better .
she brought her own water to make dinner .
she did?
yeah , she said the water here is no good .
yeah ... the water here is defiinitely not the cleanest .
are you sure about school tomorrow?
i'm sure !
alright !
let's get your things ready .
ok , i'll go look for your bag .
lkuko ... how did this get in here?
i don't know .
did you go back to the roof? .
i swear , i don't know .
i won't be mad , so just tell me the truth .
did you go up there?
no !
ok .
i'm sorry .
connecting to personal voicemail ...
hello , this is kishida ...
hello , kishida lawoffiices .
hi , my name is yoshimi matsubara .
ls mr. kishida there?
he's out at the moment , and we don't expect him backtoday .
ls that so?
well , thank you very much .
no !
lkuko , stay right here .
