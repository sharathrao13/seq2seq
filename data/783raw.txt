oscar dad's the tongue scruber !
tongue scrubber !
tongue scrubber !
my dad was the greatest .

i'm dead anyway .
wait here .
what's this?
a pink pearl?

my grandmother gave it to me .
she said it started from a tiny grand of sand , but then after a while , it grew in something beautiful .
dreams can begin small too .

take it !
it'll get you the money you need for mister sykes .
what's new on the stand?
i'd been on all over this a thousand times ,

sharkslayer !
sharkslayer !
stop !
i am not a real sharkslayer !
i lied .

and i'm not a real financial advisor !
okay , it was an anchor that killed franki .
i didn't have anything to do with it and neither did lenny .
if that was true , why did you ran away?
i think you always wanted me to be like franki .
i'll never be the shark you want me to be .
what is your problem?

so?
his best friends are fishes .
so?
he likes to dress like a dolphin , so what? !
everybody loves him just the way he is .
why can't you?

i didn't know what i have .
till i lost her .
will you get me out of this?
so i can hug my kid .
and tell him i'm sorry .
pap !
give me a hue .
i love you son , no matter what you eat , or how you dress .
oscar?
angie?
