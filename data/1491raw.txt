nice to meet you .
where you headed to?
just as far away as i can get .
well , i'll drink to that , brother .
cheers .
i think we got a little engine trouble here , folks .
just sit tight .
man !
you know , the same thing happened in st. lawrence .
we had to sit tight for nearly eight hours .
hell , this sucks .
this totally sucks .
three hundred and eighty five dollars .
cash only .
all i got is my dad's credit card .
you can't read?
cash only .
you have a license?
i had one .
they took it away , though .
looks like you're driving .
see that?
fake .
what happened?
courtesy of my stepdad .
hit me so hard i flew across the kitchen , dented the sheetrock .
my mom watched the whole thing .
why?
why does he do half the things he does?
fucking psycho , 200 pounds of worthless grease .
but i got him back .
what?
you popped him?
got me a tour of hell , though .
had me in military school by the next morning .
but i don't believe in following people's rules , man .
fuck people , fuck their rules .
that's why i jumped the wall two days ago .
now i'm going to seattle to play music .
jesus christ .
i'm so sorry , man .
i'm an idiot , i wasn't paying attention .
no .
forget about it , man .
we're lucky this piece of shit had a spare .
fuck .
you ever changed a tire before , martin?
didn't think so .
cool .
okay .
what do we got here?
oh , yeah , i'll have us back on the road in no time , no time at all .
but this time , i'm driving .
cool?
fucker's on tight .
first one's kind of always the hardest .
after that , the rest of them come off pretty easy .
you and i are about the same height , man .
what?
be quiet .
officer .
officer , i need your help .
i just saw my son on the ferry .
my son is dead .
he died 1 9 years ago , but this was my son .
he walked straight in front of me .
we had eye contact .
he recognized me .
a mother's not wrong about things like this .
how can i explain how dangerous he was , how ...?
no , not " was .
is .
my son is a very dangerous man .
what are you doing?
preparing a briefing for agent scott .
agent scott?
i don't understand why he needs someone else .
we've got everything under control .
we don't have anything , joseph .
because we didn't have enough time .
we need a couple more days , that's it .
she here yet?
she was on the flight .
they can't find her .
gerard is checking baggage claim .
she's going to be advising , right?
this isn't about territory , paquette .
there hasn't been a murder like this in years .
and the first thing you do is bring in someone else .
come on .
i have a strange feeling about this murder .
we need help .
we have nothing .
you call me as soon as she gets here .
you got to be fucking kidding me .
special agent scott?
yes .
we were waiting for you at the station .
that's a grave , you know .
yes , i know that .
agent scott .
monsieur director , hello .
i see you are already making yourself comfortable .
joseph paquette and emile duval .
they're leading the investigation .
nice to meet you .
nice to meet you .
thanks for inviting me .
we didn't .
we're pretty sure the victim was killed somewhere else , then brought here .
i think it was premeditated .
what?
i think it was premeditated .
i think the killer chose this site , specifically , and dug it in advance .
i can show you you can tell because see this?
the corners?
they're neat .
they're symmetrical .
the proportions are precise .
they're exactly 5 foot , 1 1 inches .
your victim 5 1 0?
yes , exactly .
i think he's been watching him for a few weeks ... ... studying his habits , his routine .
and he knew he could rely on digging the grave right here .
and how did he know the victim would be here when he wanted?
that's a bicycle path , right?
on the photos you sent ... ... the victim had these slight indentations on his ankles .
i'm guessing that's from bicycle clips .
also , there's a sexual element to all this .
strangling from behind , cutting off the hands , smashing in the face .
it's tactile .
it's immediate .
it's what turns him on .
and ... ... he wanted you to find the body .
i mean ... ... why else bury it at a construction site , unless you want it to be dug up , right?
his eyes , we think they were removed , or are they still in his skull?
we don't know .
i assume you're doing
skull reconstruction .
yes , of course .
it's being done right now .
okay .
are we done here?
yeah .
okay .
good night .
don't worry about paquette .
he's impulsive .
he wants to rush into everything .
i don't blame him .
it's good to see you again , illeana .
means a lot that you're up here .
lying in the grave .
my investigators think you are some kind of witch .
well , i've been called worse .
you know that .
i know .
hi .
i'm sorry for disturbing you .
a man was killed last night .
it happened in a parking lot outside a 24 hour health club around 9 : 00 .
same m . o .?
same everything .
we found the garrotte there .
it looks homemade .
the face was bashed in with a loose stone .
no time to get to the hands , though .
why not?
he was interrupted .
the victim's name was clive morin , and that's james costa .
he claims he saw what happened .
he headed towards my car , and i hear
when our guys got there , he was trying to revive the victim .
what about the blood on you?
you try to help somebody who's bleeding to death ...
ls he checking out? ... you get blood on you .
james mckeen costa .
born nova scotia , 1 965 .
everything looks pretty standard .
we've got blood samples and a dna swab on the way to the lab .
i turn , and i see ... ... a man standing over somebody else ... ... with ... ... a rock ... ... in his hand .
and then ... ... he started beating this guy's face in ....
so i shouted  what did you shout?
stop , " you know .
something dumb like that .
i don't know .
i
and then i ran towards them .
and he looked up at me , and he pointed a gun at me .
and i ....
i don't know .
i thought
i don't know what i thought .
then he ran away .
he's gone , and then i call the cops .
and i tried to perform cpr on the other guy until the paramedics came .
did you remove the garrotte?
the?
oh , the thing around his neck?
yeah , i kind of had to .
did you see where the attacker went?
yeah , he went far from me .
right?
what kind of gun did he have?
he had the kind that puts really big holes in people .
i saw this guy .
all right?
and i can draw a little bit , all right?
so ... ... maybe if you would give me a piece of paper , i can sketch him for you .
i don't know about this guy .
i can't read him .
something about his answers .
you mind if i give it a try?
no , please go ahead .
hi .
you another cop?
in a way , yes .
i'm special agent illeana scott .
special agent?
i'm fbl .
i'm helping on the case .
can i ask a few questions?
you asking the same ones ...
... the other guy did?
yes , probably .
do you mind if i have a cigarette?
no , of course not .
you nervous?
yes , i am .
extremely .
thanks for the pad of paper .
so , what did he look like?
he had extremely bright eyes .
burning , you know?
even in the dark .
his hair ... ... could have been blond .
he had a beard .
he had , not five o'clock shadow ... ... but something cultivated .
did he seem agitated or in control?
oh , jesus .
is that what i think it is?
is that?
that's the
that was around his neck , right?
am i right?
am i right?
yes , yes .
you did that on purpose?
all right , i'm doing my best here , all right?
that man's face was half gone !
i couldn't even it didn't even look human .
i did everything i could to try to help him , and he
he died , okay?
he died .
there was ....
look , there was too much blood there .
i'd never seen so much blood in my life .
and i kept trying , even though i knew that it was too late .
i saw the man who did this .
okay?
i saw him , and i can show you what he looks like .
and then ... ... you can go catch him .
okay .
what do you think?
yeah , pattern marks on morin's neck show the killer's left handed .
he sketches with his right , tried to light a cigarette with his right .
i think we need a little more than that , no?
i know .
there's also a file open on the table .
it's your profile .
evidence , notes , everything .
if he were the killer , chances are he'd be trying to take a look .
psychopaths actually have very different brain patterns .
you say words like " tree , " " sofa , " " house , " " rape , " " incest , " " murder " ... ... a normal person's brain pattern changes , their frontal lobe reacts .
psychopaths have no reaction .
they feel the same about murder as they do about dinner .
they have no emotional connection .
anyway , my point is that when he saw the garrotte ... ... he reacted ... ... with genuine shock and disgust .
a psychopath's brain?
you learn a lot of that stuff at the fbl , don't you?
i mean , all those theories , all those books .
yeah , that's right .
i'm not sure what i see in you yet , with your tricks .
i don't have any .
bullshit .
you pulled a lot of them in that room .
agent scott?
could i talk to you for a second?
excuse me .
i have sisters who get that look in their eye when they're cornered and don't like it .
i'm sorry if i'm wrong , but  no .
thank you .
all right .
agent scott .
can i talk to you?
you haven't slept yet .
no .
there's a guard in the lobby of that hotel .
and we're right by a road .
so it doesn't make any sense .
do you think it was staged?
no .
there's always a sense of joy in a staging .
a kind of arrogance .
there's none of that behavior here .
maybe he wants us to find the bodies quickly , like at the construction site .
yeah .
but why?
i mean , why?
he's not taunting us .
you know , there's no " fuck you " anywhere .
why do you do that?
what?
cover your ears?
i just think better when it's quiet .
it makes sense .
with all this , maybe he's just getting desperate .
that happens , doesn't it?
yeah , but why?
we're nowhere near him .
and he knows it .
henri bisonnette , a freelance scuba diver .
ls that our construction site body?
yes .
his sister identified him .
bisonnette used to work for him on and off for a few years .
also , his sister said he disappeared just about a couple of weeks ago .
but his credit cards have been in use all this time .
what kind of a man was he?
what do we know?
he lived in a small apartment ... ... picked up odd computer jobs ... ... didn't have a lot of friends .
you ever do that?
go diving?
my ex wife made us take one of those club med holidays .
she wasn't down 20 feet before she freaked out .
couldn't take it .
that's a good one .
have you ever gone diving , agent scott?
no , i've never tried it .
it's very serene , right?
the fish swim all around you .
they don't even mind you're there .
you'd like it , it's quiet .
i've got a hit on that sketch .
where?
some residential hotel near the river .
what are you doing?
shouldn't we be going?
we're still eating our breakfast .
follow me .
thank you .
so he paid me cash three months in advance , and i never see him .
did you see him here?
yeah , that's him .
but before you guys bust him , he kind of owes me $90 on the phone bill .
maybe you guys can take care of that .
you know what?
we need that phone bill .
all right .
you guys gonna pay it?
we'll see .
everything's clear .
oh , shit .
what?
the ring from the finger was engraved with the name clark william edwards .
it's from vancouver secondary school .
thirty four years old .
works part time on an alaskan cruise line .
his credit card was used yesterday in montreal .
he had not been reported missing .
good .
let's keep it that way .
why?
let's not reward the killer with coverage .
he likes attention .
he'll be pissed .
if he's pissed off , he'll make a mistake .
we should put a marker on edwards 'credit card and order surveillance of this place .
so we're getting close .
one more thing .
the lab results on costa's dna came in .
he's clean .
good .
man ....
you got those coffees and a sandwich?
so this isn't a coincidence , right?
no .
the two cops outside the gallery?
that's not a coincidence either , right?
does that bother you?
i've been looking over my shoulder since this whole thing happened , so no .
i'm glad for the company .
how are you doing?
i can't sleep .
but that's all right .
i have a giant show on friday , bunch of new paintings .
if i don't sell them , i'm gonna go broke .
so i'm throwing myself into my work .
kind of like you .
here you go .
keep it .
thanks .
did you get any responses to the sketch?
maybe .
you're being vague .
that night , do you remember clive morin fighting back?
i mean , you know ... ... it took me a couple seconds to see , even register , what was going on .
i heard these sounds , i saw him with the rock .
by the time i saw clive morin ... ... you know , he wasn't doing anything .
how do you know cpr?
i don't .
i mean , l
i tried to do cpr on him ... ... but i just did what i could , you know?
i imitated what i've seen on tv .
you looking at my fingers?
you looking at this?
yes .
you're , like , looking at everything .
no , this is this is l i make my own frames .
you know , and i ....
the closer we get to the show , the worse my accuracy is .
how long have you been doing that , dealing art?
i started right after school .
i went to thailand , you know?
and i ....
i met this very strange old man who was a painter .
but he didn't have any money so he just
you know , he'd just paint everything .
and he had these doors .
these incredible doors that he'd painted .
and he gave me a couple of them .
and so i brought them here and i sold them ... ... for , you know , not much money , but i sent it back to him , the money .
you know?
and it was a fortune to him .
and that's how i started .
that's very nice .
i'd like to buy you a cup of coffee , but it looks like you have a problem .
well , the first step is admitting to it .
is that a sense of humor?
is that what that is?
it is .
all that and what's this?
my cell phone number , in case you remember anything else .
anything that might be helpful .
okay .
all right .
well , thanks .
okay , i'll
maybe you want to come to the show on friday night .
you know , i think you'd like it .
lots of strange , disturbing pieces .
all right .
whoever was in that hotel room called this number 20 times .
rebecca asher .
she claimed to have seen her dead son at the quebec ferry terminal three weeks ago .
and what do we know about her?
ln her late 60s , no husband , lives alone .
i'm gonna handle this one on my own , i think .
okay?
i know you've seen this picture on the news ... ... but if you could take a closer look at it , please?
of course .
could that be your son?
it could be .
i recognized him on the ferry .
he had a full beard , hat low on his forehead .
but his eyes ... ... they were unmistakable .
and he was pulling on his ear .
it's an old nervous tic from childhood .
i could never get him to break it .
were you ever actually asked to identify a body years ago?
they showed me some remains ... ... that had been hit by a truck .
i can't say that i was in any way prepared for it .
no , of course not .
i'm sorry .
may l?
please .
martin .
no .
no , that is reese .
that's martin's older brother .
by older , i mean three minutes .
twins?
ldentical .
has reese been receiving any strange phone calls , or ...?
of course you couldn't know .
reese passed away .
i'm sorry .
they were 1 4 .
they took a raft out on the saint michel .
there had been a very big snow melt off that year ... ... and martin fell overboard .
reese jumped in to save him .
only martin reached the shore .
that must have been devastating for you .
it was .
well , it was for martin too .
you know , reese ....
he was just charismatic ... ... outgoing .
after he died , martin just took a strange turn .
he became violent .
and when he was 1 6 , he stole most of my jewelry and ran away .
the police from st. jovite called me just a few days later ... ... telling me about the accident .
that's a great one .
oh , yes .
summer vacation , fort rupert .
and this?
oh , that was our first symphony .
the magic flute .
of course .
he's cute .
he was .
he was cute .
now , that's martin .
he always had to wear those big glasses .
half the time , i couldn't tell them apart unless he had those on .
here , i'll just take ... ... that thing for you .
oh , i forgot my purse .
i'll just be  i'll get it .
here you are .
thanks .
i appreciate your time .
you've been very helpful .
you will call me when you find him , won't you?
yes , of course .
good .
so?
how long does it take here to dig up a body?
the left radius , falling off a chair or something .
this kid broke a lot of bones .
mostly in his face , hands and torso .
but as you can see , the left radius is intact .
this isn't the body of martin asher .
okay .
we better get mrs. asher someplace safe .
here , mrs. asher , 601 .
no , no .
i'm afraid that room is unacceptable .
it's too near the elevator .
how'd she talk you into putting her here?
mrs. asher has a way with words .
she's hiding something .
there's a door in the house hidden by a bookcase .
her house is under the department's protection ... ... but we can't just go and search it .
well , what about a headstrong fbl agent who's just not familiar with the rules?
now , that's a different story .
there you are .
scott . illeana .
the crime scene investigators think he came in through a second story window .
mrs. asher claims no one else has a key .
and so far , the fingerprints haven 't turned up anything .
how are you feeling?
you okay?
i'm fine .
are you sure?
i 'm fine .
illeana , leclair knows you were at the house .
i don 't think he connected you with anything else ....
could?
would you come to the office about an hour early tomorrow?
sure .
i'll see you there .
bye .
taking lives .
that's what martin asher's been doing for almost 20 years .
his first victim , john doe .
he was clumsier then .
he covered with a car accident ... ... to fake his own death , and then he took the boy's identity .
there's a gap between john doe and henri bisonnette ... ... but that doesn't mean asher was dormant .
yes , viclas gave us 1 9 unsolved murders throughout eastern canada .
at least 1 1 match the m . o .
all who either lived solitary lives or simply would not be missed right away .
henri bisonnette .
asher kills him , takes his life , his apartment ... ... uses his credit cards .
he even pays his taxes .
nothing extravagant .
he's just living bisonnette's life .
then he drops him for clark william edwards , and as edwards he stalks morin .
all of these men have something in common , something that he desires .
simply , a life different from his own .
i met his mother .
asher had a twin brother who she clearly favored .
he died in a drowning accident .
it wouldn't take much to get her to admit ... ... that she thinks martin had something to do with it .
she hates him .
so this guy can't stand to be who he actually is for even a moment .
so ... ... he overlaps bodies .
he's like a hermit crab .
he outgrows one shell , and he starts looking for a new one .
okay .
someone just broke into james costa's gallery .
all that's missing is my organizer and a business checkbook?
nothing else?
the alarm system was cut .
yeah , right .
so this doesn't feel like a normal break in?
what happened tonight , mr. costa?
right , listen , i do all my calls to europe at night .
all my shipping stuff at night .
i want a cup of coffee , i go to the diner across the street .
i come back in , the door's busted open , and my desk is all messed up .
you think it's him , right?
we're going to assign more officers to your apartment until we're sure it's nothing .
that answers my question .
clark william edwards .
you're meeting with someone named clark william edwards tomorrow night?
ls that right?
yeah .
he's a potential buyer .
his rep called me up yesterday .
could be a really big client .
you're kidding me .
we'll have undercover officers watching all the time .
the best surveillance team .
we're still talking about the same guy who smashes in people's faces ... ... and cuts off their hands?
he won't come within 50 yards of you , okay?
it would be a great service to the city of montreal .
it is a dangerous thing to do , but it is probably our best shot at catching this guy .
all right?
all right .
all right .
but only in service to the great city of montreal .
is he gonna drive me home?
could agent scott drive me home?
i should have stayed in winnipeg , you know?
i had a nice gallery , three paintings on the wall , nobody ever came in .
if you stayed there , we wouldn't have had a witness who could draw the killer .
and that's made a big difference .
that's a generous way of looking at it .
left here?
no , just keep going straight , past chevalier .
can i ...?
can i ask you a question?
yes .
how do you do it?
how do you live your life surrounded by all this ... ... ugliness?
you know , i mean , murderers ... ... and victims and these pictures , you know?
what i'm going through , just a little bit , is what you live every day , right?
this is my job .
there are different jobs .
there are better jobs .
not for me .
no there isn't .
21 9?
21 9?
yeah , yeah , right up here .
you say that like it's a punishment .
it's not a punishment .
it's more like a compulsion .
okay , we're here .
what compels you?
what compels you?
fine .
when i was 1 2 years old ... ... i heard a noise downstairs and i thought it was my dad .
so ....
so i went down .
and somebody had broken into our house .
he saw me and he came towards me .
and i grabbed a knife and i ran towards him .
and i killed him .
he was 1 6 years old .
he was probably trying to steal the tv .
but i killed him .
that's what compels me .
walk you to the door , mr. costa?
yeah , great .
i'll
what does mr. agent scott think about all this?
i'm not married .
i just i just wear that .
so listen , tomorrow ....
it's gonna be okay .
try to get some sleep .
then i'll look forward to seeing you tomorrow , okay?
is there some kind of signal i should give if i need help?
you know , like  no need .
all eyes will be on you .
we've got five men on the inside and a dozen outside .
so don't worry .
when he shows up , we'll be right on top of him .
well , that's a comfort .
everything okay?
what?
would you like another?
refill?
oh , yeah .
yeah .
scotch , right?
yeah .
he's late .
yes , he is .
i just got a note .
it says , " meet me in the men's room .
i'm going to the restroom .
meet me outside .
what's going on?
we thought it best to cut it off .
i was sitting in there for two hours .
he must've made us .
" made us "?
what does that mean?
he saw you?
he knows what's happening?
knows i'm cooperating with police?
take it easy , okay?
take it easy?
have you ever been fishing?
the bait always dies .
oh , boy .
this ought to provide you with some juicy profiling material .
single art dealer ... ... iiving in constant state of organized chaos .
purchases firearm , even though he doesn't know how to use one ... ... for a false sense of security .
you you can come in , you know .
no , it's all right .
thank you .
you two , back door .
you'll be safe .
you have two guys in back ...
... and two in the hallway .
okay?
great .
just going to check the street one more time .
if you need anything , you know how to get me , duval or paquette?
yeah .
back there at the bar  it's okay .
no , i really wish i didn't freak out like that .
i wasn't helping anybody .
you've been great .
you're making me sound nicer than i am .
you are nice .
no .
that's
that's the kiss of death .
what do you mean?
us nice guys never get the girl .
i should go .
you know how to find us .
so i'm leaving .
what do you mean?
my job is done here .
you have a profile and a witness .
you don't need me anymore .
illeana ... ... we need someone who can get into asher's head .
you have that , and you have a suspect .
that might not be enough .
what's really going on here?
nothing .
please .
what is it?
i might be having a reaction to the witness .
a reaction?
favorable .
one that could cloud my judgment .
i see .
illeana ... ... how long did we know each other when i was at quantico?
six months .
how many times ...
... were you asked for a drink?
i don't know .
how many times did you turn them down?
every time .
well ... ... i think it takes a lot to cloud your judgment .
listen , i have to catch this guy .
i know you .
you have to catch him too .
i really need you .
please .
at least the food is good .
yeah , because the art is shit .
try not to look so much like cops .
i almost didn't recognize you without a picture of a dead body .
that's nice .
it sounded better in my head .
have a drink .
no , thank you .
i mean , it's just water .
all right?
thank you .
excuse me .
this one is my favorite .
you know , it just ....
i don't know why .
the sky ....
the sky in it reminds me of growing up in nova scotia .
where'd you grow up?
just outside harrisburg , pennsylvania .
oh , yeah?
you a country girl?
i'll let you get back to work .
thank you .
it's him .
freeze !
so now he's running loose again .
we lost him in the crowd .
it was a fucking mob scene .
fucking mob scene . " and costa?
shaken up , but he wasn't hurt .
what do you think his next move is?
i think he sees james costa as unfinished business .
we've got costa on a flight to toronto tomorrow morning at 8 : 30 .
then i want one of you to take him personally to the airport .
okay , i'll go .
dismissed .
oh , hey .
would you mind taking these?

case was closed .
she's handled herself in a professional manner .
bullshit !

you remember duval?
and the poor bastard lying in the morgue?
i know how you feel .
if you have something to say , say it to me .
what did you say?
lf you have something to say
paquette !
for the past four years , i've been scouting for the league .
quebec , alberta , manitoba , bc last year .
whenever i hear about some star kid .
always traveling?
you get used to it after a while .
tough on the wife , though .
not married .
no?
so it's just you and the two sisters , right?
susan and debbie .
and where are they?
they're back home in tracadie .
tracadie .
hockey's big out there .
yeah , there's nothing else to do in that fucking town .
you play as a kid?
yeah , a little .
world junior team two years in a row .
no shit .
i could tell , i could tell .
you got all that residual confidence left over from being a golden boy .
the way you smoke ... ... your voice ... ... it's a little low .
trying to be cool , so kids at the rink don't know what a loser you've become .
what the fuck you saying , man?
don't get tense .
that's christopher hart .
what do we know about him?
he's a drug addict and an art thief .
costa was selling stolen art for him .
e mails show costa wasn't paying him .
all hart wanted was his money .
he owed him over $80, 000 .
costa set him up .
yeah .
hi .
are you there?
it's me .
who is this?
you know who it is .
come on , illeana .
you didn't fall for james costa .
somebody as beautiful and powerful as you ... ... doesn't fall for a faggy art dealer .
okay?
that guy was nothing , all right?
i didn 't take his life , i lived it .
i was the best thing that ever happened to that guy .
you looked at him ... ... and you saw me .
and i looked at you , and i saw you .
and we are the same .
fuck you . " fuck you "?
fuck you .
yeah , i did fuck you .
remember making love with those pictures of the dead people around us?
let's face it , illeana ... ... an ordinary person does not love that as much as we did .
i mean , coming inside of you was the best moment of my life .
and i feel so much better now .
everything just keeps going my way , you know?
bye bye .
what'd he say?
where is he?
a hit .
morin's credit card .
bought a train ticket ...
... to moncton 3 hours ago .
he'll be there in 20 minutes .
get commander hache on the phone and the moncton director .
i'll be fine .
thank you .
i want a cup of coffee , i go to the diner across the street .
i come back in , the door's busted open , and my desk is all messed up .
this isn 't a coincidence , is it?
help !
police !
seal off all the exits .
now , now !
do it now !
you .
after carefully reviewing special agent scott's record with the bureau ... ... the office of professional responsibility has issued a letter of termination ... ... citing egregious lack of judgment ... ... and conduct unbecoming of a federal agent .
though the bureau is saddened to lose an agent of your caliber ... ... we're confident that this decision will best serve all parties involved .
last reported observation at fort collins airport ... ... showed wind gusts to 80 knots .
clouds to 8000 feet .
visibility , two miles .
air temperature currently 1 0 degrees .
national weather forecast ....
sweetheart , you should get yourself home .
it 's miserable out there .
thanks .
see you , liz .
see you .
you be careful , huh?
i will .
i scared you .
i'm sorry .
come on , have a seat .
no , no .
come on , have a seat .
you were making some tea?
all right , let me make you a cup .
are you ...?
what are you looking for?
you looking ...?
you looking for this?
now , you see , that's got me very confused , illeana .
i mean , you got these planted all over the house .
got this one behind the fridge .
you got one under the bed ... ... the underside of the bathtub .
you must be awfully scared out here on your own .
is that it?
you feeling scared?
i followed all that business down there in washington ... ... which , i thought ... ... was completely bogus , by the way .
they were lucky to have you .
very lucky .
but then you just disappeared .
you dropped out .
you left a few footprints , though , didn't you?
i thought you were pretty easy to find .
come out here , there's never any cops around .
you don't make any phone calls .
here you go .
careful , it's still hot .
and then i saw that your belly was growing ... ... and i knew that you were waiting for me .
they're boys , aren't they?
twins?
i like going into their room .
it's full of so much love and warmth .
i can ....
i can picture them in there , playing ... ... having fun .
you and i ... ... watching ... ... and laughing .
you and l .
we can start fresh .
we can do this .
what?
what is it?
i don't want to .
i'm sorry .
those are our babies .
i know those are .
these are not your babies .
these are james costa's babies .
i don't know who you are .
why would you say something like that?
why would you say something like that?
take it back .
okay , okay .
i take it back .
i take it back !
all right .
all right .
well , then stand up .
come on .

whose babies are they?
yours .
they're mine?
give me a kiss .
kiss me .
it's all right .
i'm not gonna kill you .
i'm gonna do this until you pass out .
you're probably getting light headed right about now .
that's all right .
relax .
it's okay .
okay .
all right , come .

it's all right .
it's all right .
hey , calm down .

i don't want to hurt you .
are you gonna calm down?
yes !
yes .
