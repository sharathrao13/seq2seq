all right , chewie , let's get out of here !
the empire is still out there .
i don't think it's wise to ...
no time to discuss this as a committee .
i am not a committee !
you can't make the jump to light speed in this asteroid field ...
sit down , sweetheart .
we're taking off !
look !
i see it , i see it .
we're doomed !
the cave is collapsing .
this is no cave .
what?
run !
yes .
a jedi's strength flows from the force .
but beware of the dark side .
anger ... fear ... aggression .
the dark side of the force are they .
easily they flow , quick to join you in a fight .
if once you start down the dark path , forever will it dominate your destiny , consume you it will , as it did obi wan's apprentice .
vader .
is the dark side stronger?
no ... no ... no .
quicker , easier , more seductive .
but how am i to know the good side from the bad?
you will know .
when you are calm , at peace .
passive .
a jedi uses the force for knowledge and defense , never for attack .
but tell me why i can't ...
no , no , there is no why .
nothing more will i teach you today .
clear your mind of questions .
there's something not right here .
i feel cold , death .
that place ... is strong with the dark side of the force .
a domain of evil it is .
in you must go .
what's in there?
only what you take with you .
your weapons ... you will not need them .
bounty hunters .
we don't need that scum .
yes , sir .
those rebels won't escape us .
sir , we have a priority signal from the star destroyer avenger .
right . ... there will be a substantial reward for the one who finds the millennium falcon .
you are free to use any methods necessary , but i want them alive .
no disintegrations .
as you wish .
lord vader !
my lord , we have them .
oh , thank goodness we're coming out of the asteroid field .
let's get out of here .
ready for light speed?
one ... two ... three !
it's not fair !
the transfer circuits are working .
it's not my fault !
no light speed?
it's not my fault .
sir , we just lost the main rear deflector shield .
one more direct hit on the back quarter and we're done for .
turn her around .
i said turn her around !
i'm going to put all power in the front shield .
you're going to attack them? !
sir , the odds of surviving a direct assault on an lmperial star destroyer ...
shut up !
they're moving to attack position .
shields up !
track them , .
they may come around for another pass .
captain needa , the ship no longer appears on our scopes .
they can't have disappeared .
no ship that small has a cloaking device .
well , there's no trace of them , sir .
captain , lord vader demands an update on the pursuit .
get a shuttle ready .
i shall assume full responsibility for losing them , and apologize to lord vader .
meanwhile , continue to scan the area .
yes , captain needa .
use the force .
yes ...
now ... the stone .
feel it .
concentrate !
oh , no .
we'll never get it out now .
so certain are you .
always with you it cannot be done .
hear you nothing that i say?
master , moving stones around is one thing .
this is totally different .
no !
no different !
only different in your mind .
you must unlearn what you have learned .
all right , i'll give it a try .
no !
try not .
do .
or do not .
there is no try .
i can't .
it's too big .
size matters not .
look at me .
judge me by my size , do you?
and well you should not .
for my ally in the force .
and a powerful ally it is .
life creates it , makes it grow .
it's energy surrounds us and binds us .
luminous beings are we not this crude matter .
you must feel the force around you .
here , between you ... me ... the tree ... the rock ... everywhere !
yes , even between this land and that ship !
you want the impossible .
i don't ... i don't believe it .
that is why you fail .
apology accepted , captain needa .
lord vader , our ships have completed their scan of the area and found nothing .
if the millennium falcon went into light speed , it'll be on the other side of the galaxy by now .
alert all commands .
calculate every possible destination along their last known trajectory .
yes , my lord .
we'll find them .
don't fail me again , admiral .
alert all commands .
deploy the fleet .
captain solo , this time you have gone too far .
no , i will not be quiet , chewbacca .
why doesn't anyone listen to me?
the fleet is beginning to break up .
go back and stand by the manual release for the landing claw .
i really don't see how thats going to help .
surrender is a perfectly acceptable alternative in extreme circumstances .
the empire may be gracious enough ...
thank you .
what did you have in mind for your next move?
well , if they follow standard lmperial procedure , they'll dump their garbage before they go to light speed , then we just float away .
with the rest of the garbage .
then what?
then we've got to find a safe port somewhere around here .
got any ideas?
no .
where are we?
the anoat system ..
anoat system .
there's not much there .
no .
well , wait .
this is interesting .
lando .
lando system?
lando's not a system , he's a man .
lando calrissian .
he's a card player , gambler , scoundrel .
you'd like him .
thanks .
bespin .
it's pretty far , but i think we can make it .
a mining colony?
yeah , a tibanna gas mine .
lando conned somebody out of it .
we go back a long way , lando and me .
can you trust him?
no .
but he has no love for the empire , i can tell you that .
here we go , chewie .
stand by .
detach !
you do have your moments .
not many , but you have them .
concentrate ... feel the force flow .
yes .
good .
calm , yes .
through the force , things you will see .
other places .
the future ... the past .
old friends long gone .
han !
leia !
control , control .
you must learn control .
i saw ... i saw a city in the clouds .
mmm .
friends you have there .
they were in pain .
it is the future you see .
future?
will they die?
difficult to see .
always in motion is the future .
i've got to go to them .
decide you must how to serve them best .
if you leave now , help them you could .
but you would destroy all for which they have fought and suffered .
no , i don't have a landing permit .
i'm trying to reach lando calrissian .
whoa !
wait a minute !
let me explain .
you will not deviate from your present course .
rather touchy , aren't they?
i thought you knew this person .
well , that was a long time ago .
i'm sure he's forgotten about that .
permission granted to land on platform three two seven .
thank you .
there's nothing to worry about .
we go way back , lando and me .
who's worried?
oh .
no one to meet us .
i don't like this .
well , what would you like?
well , they did let us land .
look , don't worry .
everything's going to be fine .
trust me .
see?
my friend .
keep your eyes open , ok?
why , you slimy , double crossing , no good swindler !
you've got a lot of guts coming here , after what you pulled .
how you doing , you old pirate?
so good to see you !
i never thought i'd catch up with you again .
where you been?
well , he seems very friendly .
yes ... very friendly .
what are you doing here?
ahh ... repairs .
i thought you could help me out .
what have you done to my ship?
your ship?
hey , remember , you lost her to me fair and square .
how are you doing , chubacca .
you're still hanging around this loser?
hello .
what have we here?
welcome .
i'm lando calrissian . who might you be?
leia .
welcome , leia .
all right , all right , you old smoothie .
hello , sir .
i am see threepio , human cyborg relations .
my facilities are at your ...
well , really !
what's wrong with the falcon?
hyperdrive .
i'll get my people to work on it .
good .
you know , that ship saved my life quite a few times .
she's the fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy .
how's the gas mine?
is it paying off for you?
oh , not as well as i'd like .
we're a small outpost and not very self sufficient .
and i've had supply problems of every kind .
i've had labor difficulties ...
what's so funny?
you .
listen to you you sound like a businessman , a responsible leader .
who'd have thought that , huh?
you know , seeing you sure brings back a few things .
yeah .
yeah , i'm responsible these days .
it's the price you pay for being successful .
oh !
nice to see a familiar face .
e chu ta !
how rude !
hello?
how interesting .
who are you?
oh , my .
oh , i'm terribly sorry .
i ... i didn't mean to intrude .
no , no , please don't get up .
no !
luke !
you must complete the training .
i can't keep the vision out of my head .
they're my friends .
i've got to help them .
you must not go !
but han and leia will die if i don't .
you don't know that .
even yoda cannot see their fate .
but i can help them !
i feel the force !
but you cannot control it .
this is a dangerous time for you , when you will be tempted by the dark side of the force .
yes , yes .
to obi wan you listen .
the cave .
remember your failure at the cave !
but i've learned so much since then .
master yoda , i promise to return and finish what i've begun .
you have my word .
it is you and your abilities the emperor wants .
that is why your friends are made to suffer .
and that is why i have to go .
luke , i don't want to lose you to the emperor the way i lost vader .
you won't .
stopped they must be .
on this depends only a fully trained jedi knight with the force as his ally will conquer vader and his emperor .
if you end your training now , if you choose the quick and easy path , as vader did , you will become an agent of evil .
patience .
and sacrifice han and leia?
if you honor what they fight for ... yes !
if you choose to face vader , you will do it alone .
i cannot interfere .
i understand .
artoo , fire up the converters .
luke , don't give in to hate that leads to the dark side .
strong is vader .
mind what you have learned .
save you it can .
i will .
and i'll return .
i promise .
told you , i did .
reckless is he .
now matters are worse .
that boy is our last hope .
no .
there is another .
the ship is almost finished .
two or three more things and we're in great shape .
the sooner the better .
something's wrong here .
no one has seen or knows anything about threepio .
he's been gone too long to have gotten lost .
relax .
i'll talk to lando and see what i can find out .
i don't trust lando .
well , i don't trust him , either .
but he is my friend .
besides , we'll soon be gone .
and then you're as good as gone , aren't you?
what happened?
where?
found him in a junk pile?
oh , what a mess .
chewie , do you think you can repair him?
lando's got people who can fix him .
no , thanks .
i'm sorry .
am i interrupting anything?
not really .
you look absolutely beautiful .
you truly belong here with us among the clouds .
thank you .
will you join me for a little refreshment?
everyone's invited , of course .
having trouble with you droid?
no .
no problem .
why?
so you see , since we're a small operation , we don't fall into the ... uh ... jurisdiction of the empire .
so you're part of the mining guild then?
no , not actually .
our operation is small enough not to be noticed ... which is advantageous for everybody since our customers are anxious to avoid attracting attention to themselves .
aren't you afraid the empire's going to find out about this little operation and shut you down?
that's always been a danger looming like a shadow over everything we've built here .
but things have developed that will insure security .
i've just made a deal that will keep the empire out of here forever .
we would be honored if you would join us .
i had no choice .
they arrived right before you did .
i'm sorry .
i'm sorry , too .
no , threepio's with them .
just hang on .
we're almost there .
mmmm .
oh , my .
uh , i , uh take this off !
i , uh , don't mean to intrude here .
i , don't , no , no , no ... please don't get up .
no !
stormtroopers?
here?
we're in danger .
i must tell the others .
oh , no !
i've been shot !
lord vader .
you may take captain solo to jabba the hut after i have skywalker .
he's no good to me dead .
he will not be permanently damaged .
lord vader , what about leia and the wookiee?
they must never again leave this city .
that was never a condition of our agreement , nor was giving han to this bounty hunter !
perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly .
no .
good .
it would be unfortunate if i had to leave a garrison here .
this deal's getting worse all the time .
oh , yes , that's very good .
i like that .
oh !
something's not right because now i can't see .
wait .
wait !
oh , my ! what have you done?
i'm backwards , you stupid furball .
only an overgrown mophead like you would be stupid enough ...
i feel terrible .
why are they doing this?
they never even asked me any questions .
lando .
get out of here , lando !
shut up and listen !
vader has agreed to turn leia and chewie over to me .
over to you?
they'll have to stay here , but at least they'll be safe .
what about han?
vader's giving him to the bounty hunter .
vader wants us all dead .
he doesn't want you at all .
he's after somebody called skywalker .
luke?
lord vader has set a trap for him .
and we're the bait .
well , he's on his way .
perfect .
you fixed us all pretty good , didn't you?
my friend !
stop !
i've done all i can do .
i'm sorry i couldn't do better , but i have my own problems .
yeah , you're a real hero .
you certainly have a way with people .
this facility is crude , but it should be adequate to freeze skywalker for his journey to the emperor .
lord vader , ship approaching .
x wing class .
good .
monitor skywalker and allow him to land .
lord vader , we only use this facility for carbon freezing .
if you put him in there , it might kill him .
i do not want the emperor's prize damaged .
we will test it ... on captain solo .
if only you had attached my legs , i wouldn't be in this ridiculous position .
now , remember , chewbacca , you have a responsibility to me , so don't do anything foolish .
what's going on ... buddy?
you're being put into carbon freeze .
what he doesn't survive?
he's worth a lot to me .
the empire will compensate you if he dies .
put him in !
oh , no !
no , no , no !
stop , chewbacca , stop ... !
stop , chewie , stop !
do you hear me?
stop !
yes , stop , please !
i'm not ready to die .
chewie !
chewie , this won't help me .
hey !
save your strength .
there'll be another time .
the princess you have to take care of her .
you hear me?
i love you !
i know .
what ... what's going on?
turn around , chewbacca , i can't see .
oh ... they've encased him in carbonite .
he should be quite well protected if hesurvives the freezing process , that is .
well , calrissian , did he survive?
yes , he's alive .
and in perfect hibernation .
he's all yours bounty hunter .
reset the chamber for skywalker .
skywalker has just landed , my lord .
good .
see to it that he finds his way here .
calrissian , take the princess and the wookiee to my ship .
you said they'd be left in the city under my supervision .
i am altering the deal .
pray i don't alter it any further .
luke !
luke , don't it's a trap !
it's a trap !
the force is with you , young skywalker .
but you are not a jedi yet .
well done .
hold them in the security tower and keep it quiet .
move .
what do you think you're doing?
we're getting out of here .
i knew all along it had to be a mistake .
do you think that after what you did to han we're going to trust you?
i had no choice ...
what are you doing?
trust him , trust him !
oh , so we understand , don't we , chewie?
he had no choice .
i'm just trying to help ...
we don't need any of your help .
h a a a ...
what?
it sounds like han .
there's still a chance to save han ... i mean , at the east platform ...
chewie .
i'm terribly sorry about all this .
after all , he's only a wookiee .
put captain solo in the cargo hold .
artoo !
artoo !
where have you been?
turn around , you wooly ... !
hurry , hurry !
we're trying to save han from the bounty hunter
well , at least your still in one piece !
look what happened to me !
you have learned much , young one .
you'll find i'm full of surprises .
your destiny lies with me , skywalker .
obi wan knew this to be true .
no !
all to easy .
perhaps you are not as strong as the emperor thought .
impressive ... most impressive .
obi wan has taught you well .
you have controlled your fear ... now release your anger .
only your hatred can destroy me .
the security codes has been changed !
artoo , you can tell the computer to override the security system .
attention !
this is lando calrissian .
the empire has takes control of the city .
advise everyone to leave before more lmperial troops arrive .
this way .
don't blame me .
i'm an interpreter .
i'm not supposed to know a power socket from acomputer terminal .
what are you talking about?
we're not interested in the hyperdrive on the millennium falcon .
it's fixed !
just open the door , you stupid lump .
i never doubted you for a second .
wonderful !
ouch !
oh !
ah !
that hurt , bend down , you thoughtless ... ow !
leia !
go !
i thought that hairy beast would be the end of me .
of course , i've looked better .
you are beaten .
it is useless to resist .
don't let yourself be destroyed as obi wan did .
there is no escape .
don't make me destroy you .
you do not yet realize your importance .
you have only begun to discover you power .
join me and i will complete your training .
with our combined strength , we can end this destructive conflict and bring order to the galaxy .
i'll never join you !
if you only knew the power of the dark side .
obi wan never told you what happened to your father .
he told me enough !
he told me you killed him .
no .
i am your father .
no .
no .
that's not true !
that's impossible !
search your feelings .
you know it to be true .
no !
no !
luke .
you can destroy the emperor .
he has foreseen this .
it is your destiny .
join me , and we can rule the galaxy as father and son .
come with me .
it's the only way .
leia ...
hear me !
leia !
luke ... we've got to go back .
what?
i know where luke is .
but what about those fighters?
chewie , just do it .
but what about vader?
all right , all right , all right .
look , someone's up there .
it's luke .
chewie , slow down .
slow down and we'll get under him .
lando , open the top hatch .
okay .
easy , chewie .
lando?
okay , let's go .
oh , leia .
all right , chewie .
let's go .
i'll be back .
star destroyer .
all right , chewie .
ready for light speed .
if your people fixed the hyperdrive .
all the coordinates are set .
it's now or never .
punch it !
they told me they fixed it .
i trusted them to fix it .
it's not my fault !
they'll be in range of our tractor beam in moments , lord .
did your men deactivate the hyperdrive on the millennium falcon?
yes , my lord .
good .
prepare the boarding party and set for your weapons for stun .
yes , my lord .
iieutenant !
yes , sir .
noisy brute .
why don't we just go into light speed?
we can't?
how would you know the hyperdrive is deactivated?
the city's central computer told you?
artoo detoo , you know better than to trust a strange computer .
ouch !
pay attention to what you're doing !
luke .
father .
son , come with me .
ben , why didn't you tell me?
chewie !
it's vader .
luke ... it is your destiny .
ben , why didn't you tell me?
alert all commands .
ready for the tractor beam .
artoo , come back at once !
you haven't finished with me yet !
you don't know how to fix the hyperdrive .
chewbacca can do it .
i'm standing here in pieces , and you're having delusions of grandeur !
oh , you did it !
luke , we're ready for takeoff .
good luck , lando .
when we find jabba the hut and that bounty hunter , we'll contact you .
i'll meet you at the rendezvous point on tatooine .
princess , we'll find han .
i promise .
chewie , i'll be waiting for your signal .
take care , you two .
may the force be with you .
