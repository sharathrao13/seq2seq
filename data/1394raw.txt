forget it .
it's too risky .
i'm through doing that shit .
you always say that .
the same thing every time .
i'm through , never again , too dangerous .
i know that's what i always say .
i'm always right too .
you forget about it in a day or two .
the days of me forgetting are over .
the days of me remembering have just begun .
you know , when you go on like this , what you sound like?
i sound like a sensible fuckin 'man .
you sound like a duck .
quack , quack , quack .
take heart , 'cause you're never gonna have to hear it again .
since i'm never gonna do it again , you're never gonna have to hear me quack .
after tonight?
correct .
i got all tonight to quack .
can i get anyone more coffee?
oh , yes !
thank you .
you're welcome .
i mean , the way it is now , you're takin 'the same risk as when you rob a bank .
takin 'more of a risk .
banks are easier .
federal banks ain't supposed to stop you in any way during a robbery .
they're insured .
why should they give a fuck?
i don't even need a gun in a federal bank .
heard about this one bloke , he walks into a bank with a portable phone .
he gives the phone to a teller .
the bloke on the other end says ,
we got this guy's little girl .
if you don't give him all your money , we're gonna kill her .
did it work?
fuckin 'right it worked .
that's what i'm talkin 'about .
knucklehead walks into a bank with a telephone .
not a pistol , not a shotgun , a fuckin 'phone .
cleans the place out .
they don't lift a fuckin 'finger .
did they hurt the little girl?
there probably never was a little girl .
the point of the story isn't a little girl .
the point of the story is they robbed a bank with a telephone .
you want to rob banks?
i'm not saying i wanna rob banks .
i'm illustrating if we did , it'd be easier than what we've been doing .
no more liquor stores?
what've we been talkin 'about?
yeah , no more liquor stores .
besides , it ain't the giggle it used to be .
there's too many foreigners own liquor stores .
vietnamese , koreans , don't even speak fuckin 'english .
you tell 'em empty out the register , they don't know what you're talkin 'about .
they make it too personal .
we keep on , one of these gook fuckers gonna make us kill him .
i'm not gonna kill anybody .
i don't want to either .
but they'll probably put us in a situation where it's us or them .
and if it's not the gooks , it's these old fuckin 'jews who've owned the store for 15 fucking generations .
you got grandpa lrving sitting behind the counter with a fucking magnum in his hand .
try walkin 'into one of those places with nothing but a phone .
see how far that gets you .
forget it .
we're out of it .
well , what then , day jobs?
not in this life .
what then?
garon , coffee !
this place .
garon means boy .
this place?
a coffee shop?
what's wrong with that?
nobody ever robs restaurants .
why not?
bars , liquor stores , gas stations ; you get your head blown off stickin 'up one of them .
restaurants , on the other hand , you catch with their pants down .
they're not expectin 'to get robbed .
not as expectin 'anyway .
i bet you could cut down on the hero factor in a place like this .
correct .
same as banks , these places are insured .
manager .
he don't give a fuck .
they're just trying to get you out before you start pluggin 'the diners .
waitresses .
fuckin 'forget it .
no way they're takin 'a bullet for the register .
busboys .
some wetback gettin 'paid $1 . 50 an hour ... really give a fuck you're stealin 'from the owner?
customers sittin 'there with food in their mouths , they don't know what's goin 'on .
one minute , they're havin 'a denver omelet , the next , someone is stickin 'a gun in their face .
see , i got the idea the last liquor store we stuck up , remember?
all the customers kept comin 'in .
yeah .
you got the idea of takin 'their wallets .
now , that was a good idea .
thank you .
made more from the wallets than we did from the register .
yes , we did .
a lot of people come to restaurants .
a lot of wallets .
pretty smart , huh?
pretty smart .
i'm ready .
let's do it .
right now , right here .
come on .
all right .
same as last time , remember?
you're crowd control .
i'll handle the employees .
i love you , pumpkin .
i love you , honey bunny .
everybody be cool !
this is a robbery !
any of you fucking pricks move , and i'll execute every motherfuckin 'last one of you . and i'll execute every motherfuckin 'last one of you .
jungle boogie get down with the boogie
jungle boogie get it on
jungle boogie get down with the boogie
jungle boogie get it on
jungle boogie get up with the boogie
jungle boogie get up with the get down
jungle boogie get down and boogie
jungle boogie shake it around
okay , so tell me again about the hash bars .
okay , what you want to know?
hash is legal there , right?
it's legal , but it ain't 100 % legal .
you just can't walk into a restaurant , roll a joint and start puffin 'away .
i mean , they want you to smoke in your home or certain designated places .
those are hash bars?
yeah .
it breaks down like this .
it's legal to buy it .
it's legal to own it .
and if you're the proprietor of a hash bar , it's legal to sell it .
it's illegal to carry it , but but that doesn't matter , 'cause get a load of this .
if you get stopped by a cop in amsterdam , it's illegal for them to search you .
i mean , that's a right the cops in amsterdam don't have .
oh , man !
i'm goin '.
that's all there is to it .
i'm fuckin 'goin '.
i know , baby .
you'd dig it the most .
but you know what the funniest thing about europe is?
what?
it's the little differences .
i mean , they got the same shit over there that they got here ,
but it's just there , it's a little different .
example .
you can walk into a movie theater in amsterdam and buy a beer .
and i don't mean just like no paper cup .
i'm talkin 'about a glass of beer .
and in paris , you can buy a beer in mcdonald's .
you know what they call ... a quarter pounder with cheese in paris?
they don't call it a quarter pounder with cheese?
they got the metric system .
they wouldn't know what the fuck a quarter pounder is .
what do they call it?
they call it a royale with cheese .
royale with cheese .
that's right .
what do they call a big mac?
big mac's a big mac , but they call it le big mac .
le big mac .
what do they call a whopper?
i don't know .
i didn't go into burger king .
you know what they put on french fries in holland instead of ketchup?
what?
mayonnaise .
goddamn !
i seen 'em do it , man .
they fuckin 'drown 'em in that shit .
yuck .
we should have shotguns for this kind of deal .
how many up there?
three or four .
that's countin 'our guy?
not sure .
so that means that it could be up to five guys up there?
it's possible .
we should have fuckin 'shotguns .
what's her name?
mia .
mia .
how did marsellus and her meet?
i don't know .
however people meet people .
she used to be a actress .
oh , really?
she do anything i'd have seen?
i think her biggest deal was she starred in a pilot .
pilot?
what's a pilot?
well , you know the shows on tv?
i don't watch tv .
yeah , but you are aware that there is an invention called television ,
and on this invention they show shows , right?
yeah .
the way they pick tv shows is they make one show .
that show's called a pilot .
then they show that one show to the people who pick shows ... and on the strength of that one show , they decide if they wanna make more shows .
some get chosen and become television programs .
some don't , become nothin '.
she starred in one of the ones that became nothing .
you remember antwan rockamora?
half black , half samoan .
used to call him " tony rocky horror .
yeah , maybe .
fat , right?
i wouldn't go so far as to call the brother fat .
i mean , he got a weight problem .
what's a nigger gonna do?
he's samoan .
i think i know who you mean .
what about him?
marsellus fucked him up good .
word 'round the campfire is it was on account of marsellus wallace's wife .
so what he'd do?
fuck her?
no , no , no , no , no .
nothin 'that bad .
well , then what then?
he gave her a foot massage .
a foot massage?
that's it?
mm hmm .
then what'd marsellus do?
sent a couple cats over to his place .
they took him out on his patio .
threw his ass over the balcony .
nigger fell four stories .
he had a little garden down at the bottom enclosed in glass , like a greenhouse .
nigger fell through that .
since then , he kind of developed a speech impediment .
that's a damn shame .
hmm .
but still , you play with matches , you get burned .
what do you mean?
you don't be givin 'marsellus wallace's new bride a foot massage .
you don't think he overreacted?
antwan didn't expect marsellus to react the way he did , but he had to expect a reaction .
it was a foot massage .
a foot massage is nothin '.
i give my mother a foot massage .
it's laying your hands in a familiar way on marsellus's new wife .
i mean , is it as bad as eatin 'her pussy out?
no , but it's the same fuckin 'ballpark .
whoa , stop right there .
eatin 'the bitch out ... and givin 'the bitch a foot massage ain't even the same fucking thing .
it's not .
it's the same ballpark .
ain't no fuckin 'ballpark neither .
now , look , maybe your method of massage differs from mine .
but touchin 'his wife's feet and sticking your tongue in the holiest of holies ... ain't the same fuckin 'ballpark ; it ain't the same league ; it ain't the same fuckin 'sport .
foot massages don't mean shit !
have you ever given a foot massage?
don't be tellin 'me about foot massages .
i'm the foot fuckin 'master .
you given a lot of them?
shit , yeah !
got my technique down and everything .
i don't be ticklin 'or nothin '.
would you give a guy a foot massage?
fuck you .
you give 'em a lot?
fuck you .
you know , i'm kind of tired .
i could use a foot massage .
yo , yo , yo , man .
you best back off .
i'm gettin 'a little pissed here .
this is the door .
yeah , it is .
what time you got?
7 : 22 in the a . m .
no , it ain't quite time yet .
come on .
let's hang back .
look , just 'cause i wouldn't give no man a foot massage don't make it right ... for marsellus to throw antwan off a building into a glass motherfuckin 'house , fuckin 'up the way the nigger talks ; that shit ain't right .
motherfucker do that shit to me , he better paralyze my ass , 'cause i kill the motherfucker .
i ain't sayin 'it's right , but you sayin 'a massage don't mean nothin '.
i'm sayin 'it does .
now , look , i've given a million ladies a million foot massages , and they all meant somethin '.
we act like they don't , but they do .
that's what's so fuckin 'cool about them .
there's a sensuous thing goin 'on ... where you don't talk about it , but you know it and she knows it .
fuckin 'marsellus knew it .
and antwan should've fuckin 'better known better .
that's his fuckin 'wife , man .
this ain't a man with a sense of humor about this shit .
you know what i'm sayin '?
it's an interestin 'point .
come on .
let's get into character .
what's her name again?
mia .
mia .
why you so interested in big man's wife?
he's goin 'out of town , florida .
and he asked me if i'd take care of her while he's gone .
take care of her?
no , man .
just take her out .
show her a good time .
make sure she don't get lonely .
you're gonna be takin 'mia wallace out on a date?
it is not a date .
it's just like if you were gonna take your buddy's wife to a movie or somethin '.
it's just good company , that's all .
it's not a date .
it's definitely not a date .
hey , kids .
how you boys doin '?
hey , keep chillin '.
you know who we are?
we're associates of your business partner , marsellus wallace .
you do remember your business partner , don't you?
now , let me take a wild guess here .

you read the bible , brett?
yes !
well , there's this passage i got memorized .
sort of fits this occasion .
ezekiel 25 : 17 .
the path of the righteous man ... is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish ... and the tyranny of evil men .
blessed is he who , in the name of charity and goodwill , shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness , for he is truly his brother's keeper ... and the finder of lost children .
and i will strike down upon thee with great vengeance ... and furious anger ... those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers !
and you will know my name is the lord ... when i lay my vengeance upon thee !
i think you gonna find ... when all this shit is over and done
i think you're gonna find yourself one smilin 'motherfucker .
the thing is , butch , right now ... you got ability .
but painful as it may be , ability ... don't last .
and your days are just about over .
now , that's a hard motherfuckin 'fact of life .
but that's a fact of life your ass is gonna have to get realistic about .
you see , this business is filled to the brim with unrealistic motherfuckers .
motherfuckers who thought their ass would age like wine .
if you mean it turns to vinegar ... it does .
if you mean it gets better with age ... it don't .
besides , butch , how many fights you think you got in you anyway?
hmm?
two?
boxers don't have an old timers 'day .
you came close , but you never made it .
and if you were gonna make it , you would have made it before now .
you my nigger?
certainly appears so .
the night of the fight , you may feel a slight sting .
that's pride fuckin 'with you .
fuck pride !
pride only hurts .
it never helps .
you fight through that shit .
'cause a year from now , when you kickin 'it in the caribbean , you gonna say to yourself , " marsellus wallace was right .

whoa .

force , as in we're a force to be reckoned with .
and five , as in there's one two three four five of us .
there was a blond one , sommerset o'neal .
she was the leader .
the japanese fox was a kung fu master .
the black girl was a demolition expert .
french fox's speciality was sex .
what was your speciality?
knives .
the character i played , raven mccoy , her background was she grew up raised by circus performers .
according to the show , she was the deadliest woman in the world with a knife .
and she knew a zillion old jokes .
her grandfather , an old vaudevillian , taught her .
and if we would have got picked up , they would've worked in a gimmick ... where every show i would've told another joke .
you know any of them old jokes?
well , i only got the chance to say one 'cause we only did one show .
tell me .
it's corny .
don't be that way .
tell me .
no , you wouldn't like it , and i'd be embarrassed .
you'd be embarr
you told 50 million people , and you can't tell me?
i promise i won't laugh .
that's what i'm afraid of , vince .
that's not what i meant .
you know it .
now i'm definitely not gonna tell you 'cause it's been built up too much .
what a gyp .
martin and lewis .
vanilla coke .
mmm .
yummy .
you think i could have a sip of that?
be my guest .
i gotta know what a five dollar shake tastes like .
you can use my straw .
i don't have cooties .
yeah , but maybe i do .
cooties i can handle .
all right .
goddamn , that's a pretty fuckin 'good milkshake !
told ya .
i don't know if it was worth $5 , but it's pretty fuckin 'good .
don't you hate that?
hate what?
uncomfortable silences .
why do we feel it's necessary to yak about bullshit in order to be comfortable?
i don't know .
that's a good question .
that's when you know you found somebody really special .
when you can just shut the fuck up for a minute and comfortably share silence .
well , i don't think we're quite there yet , but don't feel bad .
we just met each other .
i'll tell you what .
i'm gonna go to the bathroom and powder my nose .
you sit here ... and think of something to say .
i'll do that .
okay .
i said goddamn !
goddamn !
goddamn .
i need some hair spray .
mmmm .
don't you just love it when you come back from the bathroom to find your food waiting for you?
we're lucky we got anything at all .
i don't think buddy holly's much of a waiter .
maybe we should've sat in marilyn monroe's section .
which one?
there's two monroes .
no , there's not .
that is marilyn monroe .
that is mamie van doren .
i don't see jayne mansfield , so she must have the night off .
pretty smart .
yeah .
i got my moments .
so did you think of somethin 'to say?
actually , i did .
however ... you seem like a really nice person , and l
i don't want to offend you .
oooh .
this doesn't sound like the usual , mindless , boring , gettin 'to know you chitchat .
this sounds like you actually have somethin 'to say .
well , well , i do .
i do .
but you have to promise not to be offended .
no , no .
you can't promise somethin 'like that .
i have no idea what you're gonna ask me .
you can ask me what you're gonna ask me , and my natural response could be to get offended .
then , through no fault of my own , i would have broken my promise .
let's just forget it .
that's an impossibility .
trying to forget anything as intriguing as this would be an exercise in futility .
is that a fact?
and besides ,
isn't it more , uh , exciting when you don't have permission?
all right , all right .
well , here goes .
what did you think about what happened to antwan?
who's antwan?
tony rocky horror .
you know him .
he fell out of a window .
hmm .
hmm .
well , that is one way to say it .
another way to say it would be that he was thrown out .
another way would be he was thrown out by marsellus .
yet even another way is to say he was thrown out of a window by marsellus because of you .
is that a fact?
no .
no , it's not a fact .
it's just what i heard .
that's just what i heard .
who told you?
they .
they " talk a lot , don't they?
they certainly do .
they certainly do .
don't be shy , vincent .
what else did " they " say?
i'm i'm not shy .
um  did it involve the " f " word?
no , no , no , no , no .
they just said that antwan had given you a foot massage .
and?
and and nothin '.
that's it .
you heard marsellus ... threw tony rocky horror out of a fourth story window for giving me a foot massage?
mm hmm .
and you believe that?
well , at the time i was told it sounded reasonable .
marsellus throwing tony out of a fourth story window ... for massaging my feet seemed reasonable?
no , it seemed excessive , but that doesn't mean it didn't happen .
i understand that marsellus is very protective of you .
a husband being protective of his wife is one thing .
a husband almost killing another man for touching his wife's feet is something else .
but did it happen?
only thing antwan ever touched of mine was my hand when he shook it ... at my wedding .
really?
truth is , nobody knows why marsellus threw tony out that window ... except marsellus and tony .
when you little scamps get together , you're worse than a sewing circle .
ladies and gentlemen .
now the moment you've all been waiting for .
the world famous jackrabbit slim's twist contest .
now , this is where one lucky couple ... will win this handsome trophy that marilyn here is holding .
now , who will be our first contestants?
right here !
all right !
i wanna dance .
no , no , no , no , no .
no , no , no , no , no .
i do believe marsellus , my husband , your boss , told you to take me out and do whatever i wanted .
now i wanna dance ; i wanna win ; i want that trophy .
so dance good .
all right .
you asked for it .
so dance good .
all right .
you asked for it .

it was a teenage wedding and the old folks wished them well
you could see that pierre did truly love the mademoiselle
and now the young monsieur and madame have rung the chapel bell
c'est la vie say the old folks it goes to show you never can tell
they furnished off an apartment with a two room roebucks sale
the 'coolerador was crammed with tv dinners and ginger ale
but when pierre found work the little money comin 'worked out well
c'est la vie say the old folks it goes to show you never can tell
they had a hi fi phono and boy did they let it blast
seven hundred little records all rock , rhythm and jazz
but when the sun went down the rapid tempo of the music fell
c'est la vie say the old folks it goes to show you never can tell

i never done this before .
i never done this either !
i ain't starting now !
you brought her here .
you give her the shot .
the day i bring an o. d. ing bitch to your house , then i give her the shot .
give it to me .
give me that .
all right , tell me what to do .
okay , you're giving her an injection of adrenalin straight to her heart .
but she's got a breastplate you gotta pierce through that .
you gotta bring the needle down in a stabbing motion .
i gotta i gotta stab her three times?
no , just stab her once !
but it's gotta be hard enough to get through her breastplate into her heart .
once you do that , you p press down on the p plunger .
okay .
then what happens?
kinda curious about that myself .
this ain't no fuckin 'joke !
am i gonna kill her?

that was fuckin 'trippy .
ohh .
oh , man .
mia .
mia .
what's
what's your thoughts on on on how to handle this?
what's yours?
well , i'm of the opinion that if marsellus lived his whole life , he doesn't need to know nothing about this incident .
if marsellus knew about this incident ,
i'd be in as much trouble as you .
i seriously doubt that .
i can keep a secret if you can .
shake on it?
mum's the word?
cool .
now , if you'll excuse me , i'm going to go home and have a heart attack .
vincent .
do you wanna hear my fox force five joke?
sure .
except i think i'm still a little too petrified to laugh .
no , you won't laugh 'cause it's not funny .
but if you still wanna hear it , i'll tell it .
i can't wait .
okay .
three tomatoes are walkin 'down the street .
papa tomato , mama tomato and baby tomato .
baby tomato starts lagging behind , and papa tomato gets really angry .
goes back and squishes him and says ,
ketchup .
ketchup .
see you around .
oh , that paddlefoot .
he funny , silly dog .
he think totem pole alive !
he arctic tenderfoot !
that totem pole been here forever !
butch?
one more thing , and we'll start for
butch , stop watching tv for a second .
yeah?
you've got a special visitor .
stand up .
stand up .
now , do you remember when i told you your daddy died in a p. o. w. camp?
well , this here is captain koons .
he was in the p. o. w. camp with daddy .
hello , little man .
boy , i sure heard a bunch about you .
see , i was a good friend of your dad's .
we were in that hanoi pit of hell together ... over five years .
hopefully ... you'll never have to experience this yourself , but when two men are in a situation like me and your dad were ... for as long as we were , you take on certain responsibilities of the other .
if it'd been me who'd not made it ,
major coolidge'd be talking right now to my son jim .
but the way it turned out , i'm talking to you .
butch ...
i got something for ya .
this watch i got here ... was first purchased by your great grandfather during the first world war .
it was bought in a little general store in knoxville , tennessee .
made by the first company to ever make wristwatches .
up 'til then , people just carried pocket watches .
it was bought by private doughboy erine coolidge ... on the day he set sail for paris .
this was your great grandfather's war watch , and he wore it every day he was in that war , and ... when he'd done his duty , he went home to your great grandmother , took the watch off , put it in an old coffee can , and in that can it stayed ... until your granddad , dane coolidge , was called upon by his country ... to go overseas and fight the germans once again .
this time they called it world war ll .
your great grandfather gave this watch to your granddad for good luck .
unfortunately , dane's luck wasn't as good as his old man's .
dane was a marine , and he was killed ... along with all the other marines at the battle of wake lsland .
your granddad was facing death .
he knew it .
none of those boys ever had any illusions about leaving that island alive , so three days before the japanese took the island , your granddad asked a gunner on an air force transport , name of winocki a man he'd never met before in his life to deliver to his infant son , who he'd never seen in the flesh , his gold watch .
three days later , your granddad was dead , but winocki kept his word .
after the war was over , he paid a visit to your grandmother , delivering to your infant father his dad's gold watch .
this watch .
this watch was on your daddy's wrist when he was shot down over hanoi .
he was captured , put in a vietnamese prison camp .
he knew if the gooks ever saw the watch , it'd be confiscated , taken away .
the way your dad looked at it , this watch was your birthright .
he'd be damned if any slope's gonna put their greasy , yellow hands on his boy's birthright , so he hid it in one place he knew he could hide something his ass .
five long years he wore this watch up his ass .
then he died of dysentery he give me the watch .
i hid this uncomfortable hunk of metal up my ass two years .
then ... after seven years , i was sent home to my family and ... now ...
iittle man , i give the watch to you .
it's time , butch .
ln the heavyweight division ,
in the right corner wearing the blue trunks , [ grunts ]
weighing 210 pounds ,
floyd ray wilson !
it's official .
it's official .
wilson is dead !
well , dan , that had to be the bloodiest , hands down , the most brutal fight this city's ever seen .
coolidge was out of there faster than i've ever seen a victorious boxer leave the ring .
do you think he knew wilson was dead?
my guess would be yes .
i could see the frenzy in his eyes give way to the realization of what he was doing .
i think any man would've left the ring that fast .
do you feel this tragedy ... is gonna affect the world of boxing?
a tragedy like this can't help but shake the world of boxing to its very foundations .
it's of paramount importance , during the sad weeks ahead , the eyes of the w. b. a. remain [ crowd cheering , yelling continues ]
man , you know i didn't
marsellus .
no , it wasn't .
i didn't do it .
i didn't do it .
how you doing?
great .
i never thanked you for dinner .
what you got?
he booked .
his trainer?
says he don't know nothin '.
i believe him .
i think butch surprised his ass same as us .
no , we don't wanna " think .
we wanna know .
take him to the kennel , sic the dogs on his ass .
we'll find out for goddamn sure what he knows and what he don't .
butch's search how do you want it done?
i'm prepared to scour the earth for that motherfucker .
if butch goes to lndochina , i want a nigger hiding in a bowl of rice ... ready to pop a cap in his ass .
i will take care of it .
mister .
hey , mister .
what?
you were in that fight , the fight on the radio .
you're the fighter?
whatever gave you that idea?
no , come on .
you're him .
i know you're him .
tell me you're him .
i'm him .
you killed the other boxing man .
he's dead?
the radio said he was dead .
sorry about that , floyd .
what does it feel like?
what does what feel like?
killing a man .
beating another man to death with your bare hands .
what are you , a weirdo?
no .
it is a subject i have much interest in .
you are the first person i have ever met who has killed somebody .
so?
what does it feel like to kill a man?
i'll tell you what .
give me one of them cigarettes you got up there , and i'll tell you all about it .
so , esmarelda ...
villa lobos is that mexican?
the name is spanish , but i am colombian .
that's some handle you got there , honey .
thank you .
and what is your name?
butch .
butch .
what does it mean?
i'm an american , honey .
our names don't mean shit .
so , moving right along ,
esmarelda , what is it you want to know?
i want to know what it feels like to kill a man .
i couldn't tell ya .
didn't know he was dead 'til you told me he was dead .
now that i know he's dead , you wanna know how i feel about it?
i don't feel the least bit bad about it .
what the fuck'd i tell ya?
huh?
as soon as the word got out the fix was in , man , the odds went through the roof .
i know .
i know .
unbelievable .
hey , fuck him , scotty .
if he was a better boxer , he'd still be alive .
if he never laced up his gloves , which he never shoulda done in the first fuckin 'place , he'd still be alive .
yeah , well , who gives a fuck?
it's over now .
yeah , well , enough about the poor , unfortunate mr. floyd .
let's talk about the rich and prosperous mr. butch .
how many bookies did you lay it around on?
all eight?
how long to collect?
so you'll have it all by tomorrow night?
no , i understand .
a few stragglers aside .
oh , fuck , scotty , that is good news .
that is great news , man .
yeah .
mm hmm .
no , me and fabienne are gonna leave in the morning .
it'll probably take us a couple days to get down to knoxville .
okay , my brother .
you're right .
you're goddamn right .
all right , scotty , next time i see you , it'll be on tennessee time .
cool , brother .
$45 . 60 .
and , uh , here's a little something for the effort .
now , if anybody asks you who your fare was tonight , what are you gonna say?
the truth .
three well dressed , slightly toasted mexicans .
bonsoir , esmarelda villa lobos .
buenas noches , butch .
whew .
keep the light off .
is that better , sugar pop?
oui .
hard day at the office?
pretty hard .
got in a fight .
poor baby .
can you make spoons?
you know what?
i was thinkin 'about takin 'a shower .
i'm stinkin 'like a dog over here .
i like the way you stink .
let me take this jacket off .
i was looking at myself in the mirror .
uh huh .
i wish i had a pot .
you were looking at yourself in the mirror , and you wish you had some pot?
a pot .
a pot belly .
pot bellies are sexy .
well , you should be happy , [ grunts ]
'cause you have one .
shut up , fatso .
i don't have a pot .
i have a bit of a tummy , like madonna when she did " lucky star .
it's not the same thing .
i didn't know there was such a difference between a pot belly and a tummy .
the difference is huge .
would you like it if i had a pot belly?
no .
pot bellies make a man look either oafish or like a gorilla .
but on a woman a pot belly's very sexy .
the rest of you is normal normal face , normal legs , normal hips , normal ass but with a big , perfectly round pot belly .
if i had one , i'd wear a t shirt two sizes too small ... to accentuate it .
you think men would find that attractive?
i don't give a damn what men find attractive .
it's unfortunate what we find pleasing to the touch and pleasing to the eye ... is seldom the same .
if you had a pot belly , i would punch you in it .
you'd punch me in the belly?
right in the belly .
ohh !
i'd smother you !
i'd drop it right on your face 'til you couldn't breathe !
you'd do that?
yeah .
promise?
yeah .
mmm .
mmm .
oh .
did you get everything?
yes , i did .
good job , sugar pop .
did everything go as planned?
you didn't listen to the ow !
you didn't listen to the radio?
i never listen to your fights .
were you the winner?
i won , all right .
are you still retiring?
sure am .
so it all worked out in the finish .
we're not at the finish yet , baby .
we're in a lot of danger , aren't we?
if they find us , they'll kill us , won't they?
but they won't find us , will they?
do you still want me to go with you?
i don't want to be a burden or a nuisance .
it's
say it .
fabienne ,
i want you to be with me .
forever?
forever and ever .
do you love me?
very , very much .
butch .
yes?
will you give me oral pleasure?
will you kiss it?
but you first .
okay .
okay .
butch .
mon amour .
l'aventure commence .
i think i cracked a rib .
giving me oral pleasure?
no , retard , from the fight .
don't call me " retard .
my name is fabby .
my name is fabienne !
stop it .
stop it !
my name is fabi
shut up , fuckhead !
i hate that mongoloid voice .
okay , okay .
sorry , sorry , sorry .
i take it back .
will you hand me a dry towel , miss beautiful tulip?
oh , i like that .
i like being called a tulip .
tulip " is much better than " mongoloid .
i didn't call you a mongoloid .
i called you a retard .
and i took it back .
butch?
yes , lemon pie?
where are we going to go?
well , i'm not sure yet .
wherever you want .
we're gonna get a lot of money from this , but it ain't gonna be the kind of money ... that we can live like hogs in the fathouse forever .
i was thinking maybe we could go down someplace in the south pacific .
kind of money we're gonna have's gonna carry us a long way down there .
if we wanted , we could live in bora bora?
you betcha .
and if after a while you didn't dig that , we could go someplace else .
maybe tahiti , mexico .
but i do not speak spanish .
well , you do not speak bora boran either .
besides , mexican's easy .  donde esta el zapateria?
what does that mean?
where is the shoe store?  donde esta  spit , please .
donde esta el zapateria?
excellent pronunciation .
mmm .
you'll be my little mamacita in no time .
what time is it?
what time is it?
time for bed .
sweet dreams , jellybean .
butch?
never mind .
aah !
merde !
you startled me .
