sleep well , oh people of bagdad !
all is quiet !
sleep !
sleep , oh dwellers of bagdad !
all is quiet !
look straight ahead of you !
go !
sleep , oh people of bagdad .
all is quiet .
the name? !
tell me , wise star !
tell me the name !
aladdin , son of ali al marouf !
aladdin , son of ali al marouf !
oh , most esteemed sprinkler of the streets !
do you know a certain aladdin , son of ali al marouf?
you're sure you don't mean karim who fell into the pond and ran stark naked around the town?
or maybe houssein who hoisted his donkey to the minaret?
allah punished him by making him blind in one eye .
where are you going?
wait !
oh , masters of the best of games except for playing with dice !
could you tell me ...
oh , honored one , where might i find aladdin , son of ali al marouf?
bagdad is a large city ...
you've been reading for 2 hours without paying me a thing !
oh , most worthy keeper of knowledge ! ..
people of bagdad !
quickly , stranger , quickly !
the beauty of all beauties , the unrivaled princess boudour , honors the baths with her presence !
any who dares to look upon the princess shall lose his head !
i don't want to !
i don't want to bathe !
i don't want to !
i don't want to !
what do you want , then?
i want him to look upon me .
then he'll have his head cut off .
so what?
mustafa !
young man , open your eyes !
come on , and you'll have no head .
i wish that a wild lion would pounce on you , so that i could kill him .
i wish that a fire would engulf all bagdad and i'd rescue you .
and that an earthquake would cause all people to perish ,
leaving only two of us , you and me .
what name were you given?
aladdin , son of ali al marouf .
you can't take the princess 'hand .
i've already done so .
cut off his head anyway ...
strike the blow !
what's the matter with you?
catch him , dead or alive !
mother !
i held the hand of the sultan's daughter , boudour !
you must ask the sultan for his daughter's hand .
and yesterday he said he was flying on dragons .
ls this not the dwelling of the chosen one and the king of luck , aladdin?
aladdin is my son .
here are presents for you from your uncle !
i didn't know my husband was blessed with a brother .
ls this not the house of aladdin , son of ali al marouf?
from my uncle?
your uncle .
they must have made a mistake .
they'll come and take it all back .
where is my brother?
where's my brother , ali al marouf?
ali al marouf has been dead for three years .
i was his best friend .
oh , my miserable brother !
oh , how cruel and bitter my fate !
forty years have i wandered over the earth !
i dreamed of coming back and embracing my brother !
but my ali didn't have any brother .
believing me dead he couldn't bear to mention my name .
where is the place the deceased loved most?
where's my nephew aladdin?
there !
my cherished nephew , tell me your innermost desire .
i shall grant it .
he will ask you for a star from the heavens .
he has just wanted me to ask for princess boudour's hand !
could he be possessed by genies?
i will cure him .
leave us now !
for 40 years i have studied alchemy and black magic with the wisest men of all maghrib .
forty years have i dedicated to the preparation of magic powders that'd open the gates of dungeons and reveal the darkest secrets .
put your trust in me .
i will help you .
where are we going , uncle?
to an enchanted city .
why?
you alone will penetrate a place from which no one's ever returned .
there you'll find an old bronze lamp .
repeat it !
an old bronze lamp ...
you will bring it to me and all your wishes will be granted .
go now !
the entrance is there !
you'll get in the shadow of the city and in the city of shadows .
who is there?
who is there?
who is there?
who is there?
who sneezed?
show yourself !
why have you come here?
i came to find the lamp !
amazing !
lncredible !
he said the truth !
i must have the lamp and i've just told you so .
what shall we do?
i don't know .
hey !
where are you?
where are you hiding?
silence !
you're disturbing our meditation !
take the lamp .
it is yours .
where will i find it?
show him the way .
this way .
this way !
this way !
ls this it?
what are you doing , uncle?
uncle? !
aladdin !
where are you?
come back at once !
aladdin , i was only joking !
aladdin !
i hear and obey !
who are you?
i'm this lamp's slave .
i'm at your command !
are you a genie?
yes .
why did my uncle want to kill me?
he is not your uncle .
he's an evil maghribian sorcerer .
we genies have long known him .
i'm yours to command !
to do what?
what you will .
strangle him?
drown him?
reduce him to dust?
no !
no !
let him go to all four corners of the earth .
to all four corners of the earth?
i hear and obey !
i don't want to !
we don't want to !
the blessings of allah be upon you !
wake up !
it's time to bake cakes .
allah has granted us another fine day .
i wish i had a skewer of shish kebab !
i didn't know you were a joker !
you play little jokes , too .
who started the fire?
i didn't know you could make cakes .
i'm eighty five , but never have i made a single cake .
have a cake !
genies never eat cakes .
what do genies eat , then?
nothing at all .
i'd like you to meet my friend the genie .
i'd rather stay in the lamp .
i knew that all that reading would end up badly .
remember , i haven't seen anything .
you haven't seen anything either .
neither of us have seen anything .
do you know why i have lived to be 85?
all is quiet in bagdad !
to live to be 100 years old , you must learn to be virtuous .
the basis for all good is in holding the spirit in check , in humility and in piety , and above all in chastity , in patience and modesty .
each of us must know when to give proof of our modesty and when to show impertinence .
and to act so as to be permanently exploring good .
because the state of perfection is modesty , and the state of evil is another kind of modesty .
will you come out for a second?
are you listening to me?
yes .
guards !
don't be afraid !
who are you?
who am l?
and who are you?
who am l?
but who are you?
princess boudour .
who?
the princess boudour .
that's all we needed .
who's that mumbling there?
where's that voice coming from?
it's a loafer who's listened to too many silly stories .
come here !
what's that?
ajar .
and what's that?
that?
an oven !
an oven ...
for baking meat cakes .
you understand?
no .
what is this mysterious monster?
it's a goat , not a monster .
does it make the cheese?
how old are you?
i'm sixteen .
i already knew what a goat is when i was three years old .
they're looking for someone .
perhaps for the bagdad thief .
they're not looking forjust one , but for forty of them .
ah , it's you?
yes , it's me .
why are you laughing?
i know what you're going to ask me .
what?
i've already been asked by 1 7 princes .
poor princes .
i refused them all .
then it's " no "?
why not?
go to my father and ask for my hand .
and will you say " yes "?
how should i know what i'll say?
i'll say whatever comes to my head !
the princess is here !
that's you again !
tie him up !
yes !
tie him !
i hope princess boudour will forgive me !
my sultan , he's the one who dared gaze on the princess twice .
sultan !
it's real luck , my meeting you like this .
i'm asking for the hand of princess boudour .
what did he say?
my tongue refuses to repeat it .
your daughter likes me and i like her .
only she says she won't marry me without your permission .
yes , sire .
our great sultan asks whether you know , young man , that seventeen princes ...
eighteen princes !
that 19 princes have already come to ask for the fair boudour's hand .
she did tell me that .
before asking for marriage , you should offer the sultan presents .
you mean rubies and emeralds?
precisely !
oh , i forgot about that !
i'll have them brought here right away .
do you have a treasure buried at your house?
i've got no treasure .
but i have a genie friend .
what?
a genie .
stay there !
throw him in the dungeon !
daughter of ours !
we're most displeased .
i'm the one who's displeased !
you've refused all of the princes .
there're no princes left .
and you did it in order to end up in a beggar's hut .
don't you dare call him that bad name !
what name should i call him?
aladdin !
from now on we shall call by name every beggar and good for nothing .
shut up !
who is to shut up?
us?
you will set him free at once and ask for his forgiveness .
those were your last words .
we'll have you wedded today .
try and see what happens .
i'll try .
well , so !
remember it and write it down !
write it down .
we shall give our daughter and half our kingdom to ...
to the very first man to walk through that door .
from now on , half our kingdom and our daughter belong to your son .
out of my way !
grab the princess !
no one has anything to suggest to us?
there is a way .
speak up .
since your daughter went to bagdad and acquired bad habits there , we should convince her that she never visited bagdad .
how?
the princess must be told it was just a dream .
since it was but a dream and nothing has happened to her , she will be obedient again .
and the heart of our great sultan will rejoice .
and what does the great wiseman say?
a dream's not that's not a dream , and not a dream is not a dream .
so to say of not a dream that it's a dream is the same as to say of a dream that it's not .
we order to say of a dream that it is not one , and of not a dream , that it's a dream ...
the princess went nowhere .
she dreamed it all .
everybody understood us?
be off with you !
i even saw in a dream that i taught crocodiles to read in persian .
i have also dreamed that i was a minaret and that from my top the muezzins were crying .
i have even dreamed that my hair walked to the bazaar to buy a comb .
so what?
so you've only dreamed about that beggar .
lf i dreamed it , how come mubarak fought with him?
mubarak !
i'm told that yesterday you fought with some beggar .
yesterday i didn't go any place .
i mean i hunted and killed ...
a lion .
a lion !
yes !
i remember it very well .
i was in bagdad and i saw a goat .
a what?
a goat .
it's true .
and mustafa brought me back to the palace .
mustafa !
i'm told that yesterday ...
who?
me?
the last two days i spent in bed with a toothache .
our daughter boudour , we're not angry with you .
tell me , it did happen , didn't it?
you did scold me about aladdin !
i scolded you about prince abou abdul ibn abdul ...
no !
aladdin !
i've never heard of aladdin .
how can it be?
aladdin !
then i dreamed it .
all this was just a dream .
tomorrow you'll lose your head .
any other news?
do you hear that music?
i'm marrying princess boudour !
are you in there?
i hear and obey .
have you no shame?
what?
why did you let them throw aladdin in a dungeon?
all you had to do is to rub the lamp .
couldn't you guess it yourself?
it's not my concern .
i knew it would end badly !
oh , my heart's joy !
my little camel !
bring aladdin back !
take your lamp and your genie !
i never want to see them again !
i'll teach you how to fly on dragons !
i'll teach you how to ask for princess boudour's hand !
i pray that's not the goat !
the lamp will be mine !
oh , the brightest of all stars !
he flew away !
he's flown away !
where's mubarak?
who has flown away?
mubarak !
what is the meaning of this?
get me down from here !
what are you doing there?
come down !
i can't !
get me down from here !
how did you climb up there?
let him stay up there !
jump !
i'm stuck !
why did you climb up there?
i didn't climb up there .
everybody saw you up there !
since you climbed up there , you might as well say so .
oh great sultan , pardon this foolish child !
it is only because he's young and has too much passion .
all right .
we'll leave them once more .
stay here !
what if he flies away again?
just let him try to .
oh , heavenly one ...
oh , the brightest of all ... ... stars !
good night , boudour !
i'm the son of the grand vizier !
what a clever genie !
what would the son of a vizier be doing in a jar?
make way for the great sultan !
so , whoever is stuffed in the jar claims to be my son !
who is in there?
mubarak ! ls that you?
get them all out of here !
get them out !
why did you get in the jar?
i didn't .
lousy liar !
everyone saw you in thatjar .
why did you stuff yourself in there?
whether or not he got in there no longer interests us .
lf he prefers stuffing jars to half my kingdom and my daughter , just let him stuff them .
announce it to all of bagdad !
from this moment on , the son of the vizier and princess boudour are no longer husband and wife !
ln ten thousand years i haven't laughed so much !
let's stuff someone else into a jar !
wait .
we've other things to do .
go away !
why?
because when i wake up and you're not here , it will be so painful .
wait !
let this dream go on and on ...
i don't want to wake up .
it's no dream .
i simply have a genie friend .
don't you believe me?
rub this .
then it wasn't a dream , but pure and simple magic?
you can do anything?
that's right !
you must swear it .
it's you women who need to swear , but we genies always speak the truth .
well , then , bring me a peach .
so it was real !
i was not dreaming at all .
they have deceived me !
what's all this for?
the wedding !
whose wedding?
ours .
don't interefere .
salam .
salam .
what is all this?
what does it mean?
it means you're sleeping .
what d'you mean , i'm sleeping?
they are sleeping , too .
and i'm too .
we're all sleeping and seeing a dream .
now we'll have a wedding !
here's my fiance !
you're in prison , aren't you?
now you see it's just a dream !
don't try to confuse us .
what says the vizier?
let the wiseman speak first .
what says the wiseman?
the realization of knowledge is a sign of ignorance , and ...
but why me?
and why me rather than you?
a goat !
yes , a goat !
it is my goat !
look !
don't be afraid .
it's a dream .
let me explain it .
don't be scared !
everything's possible here !
we're just dreaming .
you understand?
he doesn't !
don't be afraid !
look .
i'm pushing you .
now you push me !
that's right !
be seated , honored guests .
after all , it's a wedding !
look at him .
where's he now? ln prison .
he's to be executed .
oh , when we wake up , have him executed too .
and what is he now?
a bridegroom at his wedding .
he is happy !
and we are happy !
lsn't it swell to have a wedding !
when i married your father , it was not in a dream .
give the lamp back .
no , i won't .
i don't want it this way .
give it .
and i like it this way .
don't quarrel .
i'll give you a spinning wheel .
and what is that?
you will like it .
no mercy for me , and no forgiveness , my dear nephew !
kill me as you would kill a mad dog .
or i shall kill myself and take the sin on my soul !
what's stopping you?
to the count of three .
one .
two .
it's a bad dream .
we'd better awaken .
two and a half .
aladdin , don't spoil the wedding !
two and a quarter !
all right .
i forgive you .
why does no one glorify us?
oh incomparable sultan , whose brightness is eclipsing moon and sun and fiery meteors , and all the world's emperors !
this pleases us .
i shall go milk the goat .
give the lamp back .
no , i will not !
give it back !
no , i won't !
will you give it back?
i want our wedding to be real and not a dream .
it is real .
lf you don't give it , i'm going !
then you don't love me .
go !
and take your lamp , too !
we call you .
i won't come !
come out !
no , i won't !
what are you supposed to say?
i hear and obey .
who are you?
i'm the lamp's slave .
repeat it .
i'm the lamp's slave .
louder !
i can't hear you !
i'm the lamp's slave !
the wedding is going on .
i'm the bridegroom !
sultan .
a miracle's happened !
long live the new sultan al salam kerim !
a sultan the world has not yet beheld .
the wisest of all sultans !
the wisest .
i ask your forgiveness .
but i have to kill you .

i'm your friend , but i'm the lamp's slave !
yes , of course .
i'm the lamp's slave , but i'm your friend !
a slave or a friend?
get in this jug .
why?
you'll live in the jug .
no genie ever lived in a jug .
you'll be the first then .
all right?
rub me .
i hear and obey .
i dreamed i was a sultan .
don't get distracted .
come out !
i dreamed i milked a goat .
and like a bright star ,
like the constellation of the lion among ordinary lions , shines the name of our great ...
traitor !
our daughter boudour !
won't you come in?
all is quiet in bagdad .
all is quiet in bagdad , all is quiet , quiet ,
all is quiet in bagdad , all is quiet , quiet ...
for children up to 16 years old ...
the end
