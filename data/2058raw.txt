evil's afoot .
we're on a stakeout , gadgetmobile ! .
no , you're on a stakeout .
i'm on a sleep in .
so keep it down , a'ight?
the least you could do is stay alert .
alert for what?
face it .
inspector g ... since we locked up claw , all the bad guys have been ... too afraid to show their faces in riverton .
one thing i've learned in all my years ... of crime fighting , gadgetmobile ... is that it's always the most quiet ... right before the criminals strike ! .
and speaking of crime ...
potential law breaker at 12 : 00 !
who , grandma over there?
go , go , gadget radar gun .
no , no , no .
go , go , gadget radar gun .

i've seen your type before .
you've got a need for speed .
yes i know .
hey , uncle gadget !
hi , brain .
i thought we agreed you'd call me " lnspector " ... in front of the hardened criminals .
she's a hardened criminal?
don't be fooled by appearances , penny .
look what i found in her purse .
probably from one of her victims .
and look at this .
liquid evil .
but , officer
save it for the judge , perp .
yeah , but , but , but .
everybody's got a big but .
what are you doing here?
isn't today a school day?
there aren't any good cases to solve at school .
i want to solve real cases with you .
penny , i told you before ... you're too young to be chasing criminals .
you should be in school .
uncle gadget , if you'd just give me a chance
look , i have to go .
i'm in the middle of a big arrest .
now you get back to school ... and i'll see you tonight .
and you , i hope you like prison food .
mm , mm , mm .

iet's see how your physiobiometric ... febble fitzer is functioning .
diagnostics check out fine .
what seems to be the problem , gadget?
baxter .
i'm still having gadgets with my glitches .
i mean , glitches with my gladgets .
i'm all messed up .
sorry , gadget , i don't see what the problem is .
watch .
go , go , gadget toothbrush .
see?
bubble gum .
i see what the problem is .
isn't there something you can do for me , baxter?
well , you're the prototype gadget , gadget .
there's bound to be a few glitches .
but you'll be happy to know we've been working on it .
i'll let you in on a little secret .
soon , we'll be unveiling something ... soon that'll solve all these glitches for good soon .
wowsers .
thanks , baxter .
well , better go check in with the chief .
i wouldn't bother the chief right now .
i heard some idiot arrested his mother this afternoon .
where is he? !
gadget !
oh ...
you put my mother in jail for drag racing?
and driving without a license .
you've always said , chief , no one is above the law .
this is what you said last week when you arrested ... that troop of girl rangers for selling cookies !
those cookies were three days past expiration date !
what ugh .
you are this close to being put on probation , gadget .
now , let's get my mother out .
heaven knows what's happening to her ... down there with all those lowlifes .
when his guard is down , his kidneys are exposed ... and that's when the marathon of pain begins .
oh !
who's your grandma now?
take some of this !
how'd you like this?
wowsers , that's gotta hurt .
mom's tough love .
this is your last warning , gadget .
stick to solving real crimes .
chief , there are no real criminals left .
they're all in riverton prison .
gadget here .
what?
wowsers !
you'll never guess what happened .
claw escaped !
claw escaped?
police have put out an all points bulletin ... and are setting up a dragnet ... in hopes of finding the fugitive .
citizens are advised that if they see ... an evil genius with a claw . not to approach him .
dial 91 1 immediately .
he's extremely dangerous and really . really mean .
and i'm on the case .
bye bye , penny !
wait , uncle gadget !
let me come with you .
i can help look for clues
i told you before , penny , you're too young .
how old do you have to be to be a detective?
i don't know .
but older than you are now .
look ...
i've got work to do .
i'll see you tomorrow .
don't forget to brush your teeth .
i could do so well ... if he would just give me a chance .
my finely honed instincts are telling me ... that he probably escaped through here .
oh , really?
gadget , take a look at this .
we found this in claw's cell .
wowsers .
you don't think he's still holding a grudge?
gadget , listen .
the whole city is counting on you .
go out there and catch claw .
oh , i'll catch him .
caught him before , catch him again .
don't you worry , chief .
i'll have claw back behind bars before you can say
gadget ooh !
brick . retrieve my darts !
huh?
ooh !
mckible . serve my tea !
i don't see why we gotta ... retrieve your darts and serve your tea .
yeah !
we're vicious minions , not valets .
aah !
oh !
heh heh heh .
one sugar or two?
two .
here , boss .
dr. claw , this place is a dump .
what happened to your multimillion dollar ... high rise evil headquarters?
what do you think happened to it?
aah !
when gadget arrested me ... the police confiscated all my assets .
but after we've pulled off the crime of the century ...
i'll be back on top again .
great another crime of the century .
i'm still on parole for the last one .
what's the plan this time?
watch and see .
the federal reserve bank ... with a deposit of over five trillion dollars ... in pure gold . was built two years ago ... after riverton was declared statistically ... the safest city in america .
utilizing the latest in security technology ... and a squadron of armed guards ... the bank is considered impregnable .
not for long .
we're gonna rob the federal reserve !
right before riverton's eyes ... and there won't be a thing gadget can do about it .
how we gonna do that?
they said the bank was impen
really hard to get into .
yeah , i don't see how .
that's why you're minions , and i'm an evil genius .
he's got a point .
yeah .
we are going to build the ultimate super weapon .
but we haven't much time .
23 a. m ... the x force one satellite will be directly over riverton .
and by then . we need to steal ... ion fuel cells . a protoid laser ... and a ruby ... plus a few miscellaneous knickknacks .
yum .
i love knickknacks .
any news on claw's escape?
the city's in a panic !
the people want to know .
what are you doing to capture claw?
ladies and gentlemen , this is a momentous day .
huh?
the gadget pr . ogr . am has helped make riverton ...
thanks a lot .
hmph ! ... the safest city in america !
bob !
thank you , mayor .
we weren't going to unveil this until next year ... but in light of claw's escape ... we decided to move up our timetable .
baxter ..
this is gadget model 2 ... or " g2 " for short .
the latest . most newest gener . ation ... in the gadget program .
g2 reporting for duty .
sir !
wowsers .
she's similar to the original gadget ... but she's completely , entirely all robot .
not to worry , g2 ...
i've got everything under control .
oh , lnspector , you're everything ...
i ever wanted in a crime fighter .
gadget .
gadget !
gadget , could you give me a hand , please?
certainly , chief .
i want to give a little demonstration of what g2 can do .
pleasure to meet you , miss ... 2 .
g2
must be a loose wire or something .
i'll speak to baxter about that .
g2 will now show us how she would apprehend the suspect .
gadget , i want you to take this stolen money ... and hide it on your person .
stolen money !
stop this felonious and unlawful act ... or i shall have to use force .
well , she has got a very commanding voice .
alert . suspect . suspect .
very well .
you were warned .
you have the right to remain silent .
if you give up this right , anything you say ... can and will be held against you .
all right , g2 , i think we get the picture .
bravo !
bravo !
thank you .
iadies and gentlemen
she is very good .
i noticed that she didn't say " go , go , gadget .
that's one of the many improvements i've made to g2 . 0 .
like it?
you might say that g2 is you without the glitches .
i'm putting her on the claw case right away .
fantastic .
i always wanted a partner .
and when we interrogate criminals ...
i'll play good gadget , and you can play bad gadget .
i don't think so .
ok , then you play good gadget , and i'll be bad gadget .
i appreciate the offer , lnspector ... but i work alone .
but , chief , the claw case is my case .
you can go back to cracking speeders on the highway .
there's a new sheriff in town .
hmm?
uncle gadget?
is this tr . ue?
uncle gadget?
is this tr . ue?
they're giving the claw case to this g2 character?
for the time being , but don't worry , penny ...
i'm being reassigned to another high profile case .
what could be more high profile than claw?
it's top secret , penny .
so top secret that they haven't even told me yet .
hmm .
so , what are you making?
i'm just making your favorite dessert .
apple crumb cake with raisin cinnamon icing ... and coconut sprinkles?
ok , i'm making your second favorite dessert ...
iemon pudding .
so , since you're off the case ... you wouldn't want to see this clue i found about claw .
clue claw?
i mean , a claw clue?
is it a clue about claw?
take a look at today's classifieds .
wanted " ...
apply 7 p ; m. tonight .
call 555 01 39 for appointment .
i've already got a job , penny , but thanks .
no , i checked the number ... and it's for a bar called " the blue monkey .
you know what this means?
uncle gadget , if you go to the blue monkey ...
i bet it will lead you right to claw .
you can get back on the case and get a jump on g2 .
you know , penny , if i went to the blue monkey ... it might just lead me to claw .
then i could get back on the case and get the jump on g2 .
that's what i was just saying .
did you?
i guess great minds think alike .
so , we'll leave right after dinner?
no .
nope .
i'm sorry , penny ... but this is official police business only .
you gotta let me come with you .
i can help you .
penny , this is no place for a kid .
i'm not just a kid , uncle gadget .
of course not .
you're a very special kid .
but there's more to being a detective than being smart .
it takes a sharp eye ... for every detail , every little nuance .
a good detective never lets anything get
uncle gadget , the pudding !
go . go .
gadget . stop beater . !
ok !
heh heh heh .
everything's fine !
it's a good thing i wore an apron .

look , boys , malibu barbie is gonna get rough with us .

wowsers , she's good .
lucky for them i wasn't in there .
i would have been on them like ugly on a mini van .
thanks for the backup , g2 ... although everything was under control .
i had those toughs right where i wanted them .
inspector , what were you doing in that bar dressed as ...
what exactly are you dressed as?
i'm a hooligan .
huh?
i went undercover to follow up on a valuable lead ... concerning where's clawabouts
i mean , claw's whereabouts .
i'm in charge of the claw investigation , remember?
maybe we got off on the wrong foot .
ooh !
oh .
perhaps we could have dinner sometime just to discuss crime fighting strategies .
imagine how great we could be as a team .
we could call ourselves " the g force " ... or " the g team " or " the 2 gs " .
lnspector gadget .
what up , g?
even though i'm not programmed for such emotions ...
i admit i find you strangely ... iikable .
hmm .
but as i already told you , i work alone .
and so do l .
i'm just saying that maybe we could work alone together .
you don't even know who i am .
think about it .
no , really .
you can't arrest me .
i'm one of the good guys .
really , i am .
hold on .
she's with me .
what are you doing here?
didn't i tell you to stay home?
never mind that .
look what i found about claw .
dr. claw's pulling a little heist tomorrow night ... at the concentrated lndustries warehouse .
wowsers !
we'll have to have a stakeout .
you mean , i'll have to have a stakeout .
this is our case , lady .
penny .
i know .
you told me to stay out of it ... but i did find you this clue .
penny , i know you want to be a detective .
but this following me around all the time ... just isn't going to fly .
oh !
uh ...
gadgets !
hi , chief .
gadget , what are you doing in a barroom brawl?
looking for clue claws .
claw clues clue about claw .
and i was right .
we got a valuable lead .
yeah , a very valuable lead .
we have evidence of a possible heist ... at concentrated lndustries warehouse tomorrow night .
great work , g2 !
stake it out and catch him red handed .
fantastic .
i'll bring the doughnuts .
i already told you .
you're off this case .
both you and nancy drew here .
hey !
pbbt !
and you're off the force , too , if you get within ... as a hundred yards of that stakeout .
fine , but if claw gets away with his plan ... for world domination , don't come crying to us .
remember , gadget 100 yards !
99 , 100 ... 101 yards away .
i'm at the stakeout ... but i haven't violated the chief's orders .
see?
at the stakeout ... not at the stakeout .
stakeout ... not at the stakeout .
i don't think the chief will see it that way .
go , go , gadget binoculars .
she certainly is well equipped , isn't she?
ooh , gadget's got a girlfriend .
don't be silly , gadgetmobile .
our relationship is strictly professional .
besides , she's state of the art .
i'm last year's model .
a few extr . a miles look good on a player .... and you are a player , g.
you're tricked out with more extras than the batmobile .
just show her that it's all good under the hood .
i have no idea what you just said ... but i'm sure that if i were a car ... it would have been very helpful .
all i'm saying is , you got to show her ... you got what it takes , man .
you're right .
you're right !
thanks , gadgetmobile .
i'm just gonna go up to the roof ... and scope out the situation .
you go ahead on with your bad self ha !
i don't know what that man would do without me .
hold on , there .
what do you want?
we got a delivery .
this ain't no food warehouse .
i need some authorization .
will that do?
we're in , your clawfulness .
good .
now bring me the ion fuel cells .
yes , sir .
halt !
oh !
it's the mechanical meter maid !
i'm real scared !
ha ha ha !
good one , squint .
uh oh .
looks like g2 could use some backup .
stop this felonious and unlawful act ... or i shall have to use force .
no problem , love .
catch !
ooh !
she got the kung fu .
i'm gonna give them a little bit of the what for !
go , go , gadget helicopter hat .

i don't know .
oh , i don't like this .
oh , no !
unh !
hur . r . y it up . bonehead !
go , go , gadget something to get me down there .
wowsers .
i never knew i had one of these .
stop this felonious and unlawful act ... or i shall have to use force .
oh aah !
you imbecile !
suspect . suspect .
very well .
you were warned .
gadget to the rescue !
ooh unh !
no !
no !
what are you doing here?
well , it looked like you could use some help .
quick , grab the fuel cells !
let's get out of here !
they're getting away .
not to worry , g2 .
i'll get us out of this .
go , go , gadget scissors .
gadget !
i told you specifically not to go to the stakeout .
i told you specifically not to go to the stakeout .
that's not entirely accurate , chief .
you told me not to get within 100 yards of the stakeout ... and i posted myself exactly 101 yards away .
then how did you get tangled up with me inside the warehouse?
you gave me backup at the bar ..
i thought i'd give you backup at the warehouse .
i never need backup .
until we find out what claw needs the fuel cells for ... all of riverton is at risk .
chief , you have to put me back on the case .
the department needs me !
that's right , gadget .
the department does need you .
and i've got just the assignment ... to take advantage of your unique abilities .
go , go , gadget power brush .
come on , come on .
i'm stuck .
go , go , gadget turbo speed .
go , go , gadget stop !
stop !
be careful in there .
that toilet's got quite a flush .
looks like gadget has finally found his true calling
roto rooter man .
ha ha ha !
hey , dr. claw , check this out an unlimited supply of bowling shirts .
and shoes !
silence !
everyone , pay attention !
who can tell me what we need next ... to build my super weapon?
the laser . !
a new exper . imental pr . otoid laser .... that's being unveiled at the riverton science convention .
but to take it , we need a little diversion .
hey , uncle gadget .
penny , shouldn't you be in school?
uncle gadget , school was over an hour ago .
oh .
i'm sorry , penny .
oh . hey !
this came for you in the mail today .
looks kind of strange .
lnspector gadget ...
wowsers !
he must have really bad handwriting ... to go to all that trouble .
or maybe he doesn't want you to identify his handwriting .
look , it's signed " anonymous concerned citizen .
it's good to know we still have a concerned citizen ... who's willing to get involved .
this smells like claw .
no .
why would claw want me there?
i don't know .
uncle gadget , this might be a trap .
penny , i'm thinking that this might be a trap .
that's what i just said .
you gotta let me come with you this time .
sorry , penny .
no can do .
this is work for a serious law enforcement professional .
you mean like a bathroom attendant?
exactly .
don't stay up for me , penny .
i'm on the case .
i need you to keep a sharp eye out , gadgetmobile .
if you see anything suspicious , you let me know .
like a trekkie with a girlfriend?
exactly .
the goose has arrived ready to be cooked .
ther . e we go .
how's that?
yeah . now .
i'll just ...

no , no .
it's supposed to translate into english ... once i've got all the bugs out .

i'll see you around , baxter .
bye bye , pedro .
good luck !
pedro .
better have myself a little look around .
go , go , gadget binoculars .

i quit !
hmm .
wait a second .
i don't want to quit .
besides , chief , it's not my fault .
look what baxter found on me a circuit override chip .
i don't care !
claw stole the laser ... and you tarred and feathered the mayor in toothpaste ... and caused $100, 000 in damages .
turn in your badge , gadget .
oh , but , chief ... all i ever wanted to be my entire life ... was a crime fighter .

window washer , huh?
dog catcher ooh , parking valet .
sky's the limit .
but , uncle gadget , you can't give up now .
look what we've got .
it's a bowling shoe .
one of claw's men dropped it at the science convention .
what were you doing at the science convention?
never mind that .
we can solve this together .
we can track down claw and get you your job back .

i'm through .
all right , i'll track down claw myself .
no .
no , no , no ... no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no .
you are to stay out of this completely .
this is a grown up problem .
uncle gadget , just give me a chance .

i'll never be a crime fighter .
never again .
you don't believe in me .
go away , brain .

what would claw want with a ruby?
claw's definitely up to something big .
wait a minute .
i know what claw's up to .
he's going to build
come on , brain .
we're rich !
hey , hey !
how much do you think this thing would fetch on ebay?
about $1 . 98 .
no , nitwits .
once we've robbed the federal reserve ... we can buy hundr . eds of these baubles .
with my secret weapon , riverton will be defenseless as will the rest of the world !
i've got to tell uncle gadget .

g2 is finished ... along with the whole gadget program .
it's time we reinvested ... in some good old fashioned policemen and women ... not these mechanical clowns .
ms. mayor , if you just give me another chance
you had your chance .
it's bad enough they stole the ruby ... but what's worse ... no one gave any money to my campaign .
i should've learned my lesson with gadget .
this whole program is a total waste of time .
come on , g2 .
we're taking you to the precinct for immediate deactivation .
deactivation?

nothing i can do .
or is there?
ok .
where's that light switch?
wrong switch .
what happened?
i reactivated you .
inspector gadget , why would you do that?
i hate to see a good detective get recycled ... and i've always had great admiration ... for your investigative abilities and physical prowess ... your commanding voice .
inspector , are you saying you like me?
well , i suppose .
in a manner of speaking .
strictly professional .
huh?
thank you .
you're welcome .
brain , what are you doing here?

the bowling shoe .
penny was right .
i should've listened to her .
she tried to tell me , and i didn't listen to her .
speaking of listening ...
i'm getting a little tired of liver flavored kibble .
would it kill you to shell out for a pork roast or prime rib?
look , g2 , my niece is in trouble .

you may have won this round ... but i'll get you next time , gadget .

he must've put in his own security code .
then we'll just destroy it .
no !
then everyone will be frozen forever .
we just have to think like claw .
what kind of a code would a supervillain put in?
i got it .
and i just lost it .
wait a minute .
i know .
let's try " crime always pays .
not always , claw .
oh . yeah !
and for heroically foiling dr. claw and saving riverton ...
i would like to award lnspectors gadget and g2 ... these distinguished conduct medals ... for their service to this city .
yay !
congratulations , gadget .
i'd like to announce that we are going to double ... the gadget unit's budget for next year ... so that if claw ever shows his face in riverton again ... we'll be ready for him .
excuse me , chief .
if i could just possibly ...
even just for a second .
the real secret to our success has always been teamwork ... but there's one member of our team ... who hasn't been acknowledged yet .
and so , for providing key support ... to members of the gadget team ...
i would like to award this junior lnspector medal ... to penny for her meritorious conduct .
i couldn't have done it without you , penny .
you are one special kid ... and i'm proud to have you as a partner .
thanks , uncle gadget .
yes , brain .
you're special , too .
hello?
anybody r . emember .... the inter . nal combustion member . of the team?

good night , gadget .
see you monday .
good night , baxter .
night , baxter .
bye .
come on , brain .
inspector .
i wanted to say i may have been a bit premature ... in my early evaluation of your abilities .
that's very big of you , g2 .
i was wrong to think of you as inept , clumsy , imbecilic ...
don't mention it .
obsolete , simple minded , malfunctioning
yes , yes .
i get the picture .
anyway , i look forward to more teamwork in the future .
i just love happy endings .
it must be a loose wire or something .
i'll speak to baxter about that .
don't bother .
huh?
oh .
gadget !
