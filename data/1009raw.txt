hey , maggie .
hey , ryan .
hey , what'd you do last night?
you know , the usual had the driver take me shopping , hit up some clubs .
then wound up at some after hours talking fashion with the beastie boys .
you?
picked up ashley grant in the ferrari , had dinner at one of my restaurants .
reluctantly made an appearance at some vlp awards show party .
you know , same old thing .
right .
watched tv and made a mix tape .
played the accordion .
thanks , dad .
i'm only saying this because we're friends ... but you really need to get over this ashley grant thing .
because?
because you've been into her forever ... and it's just not healthy .
you're like obsessed .
so?
so , every guy in school likes her .
you'd get crushed .
here comes the steamroller now .
hi , ashley .
are you okay?
ashley grant wants me , man .
hey , floyd .
you know , i'm gonna miss this place .
i'm gonna miss this place the games , the parties , all these lovely women diggin 'me .
more like all but one of 'em .
maggie carter ... breaks my heart .
i still got four weeks .
how many times are you gonna ask her out?
and be completely shut down .
but this time i got a plan .
sorry about ... your mouth .
well , that's the first complaint i've had about it so far .
" sorry about your mouth "?
what the hell is wrong with me?
you suck with women , especially fine ones like ashley grant .
way to go , champ .
thanks .
relax , ryan .
it could be worse .
oh , really?
speaking of .
your mom's on stage in her nurse's outfit .
hi , mrs. woodman .
attention , everyone .
could you please take your seat?
everybody find your seats .
quickly , please .
we have a very exciting lecture today , and i'm sure you won't wanna miss it .
watch this .
he's gonna get dissed .
excuse me .
oh , you gotta pay the toll .
you want me to kick you in the face?
that depends .
would you be naked?
school's almost out and you're still saying no to me .
say it isn't so .
no , really , man .
the master has lost his touch .
hello , everyone .
i'm katie woodman , school nurse .
and since summer's approaching , i thought i'd talk to you ... a little bit about safe sex .
as you know , the safest route is abstinence .
but if you're going to be sexually active ... there's a few things that you need to know , okay?
speaking of " wood man .
hot from mama's personal collection?
shut up .
for those of you who may not know , this is the penis .
come to my house after school .
you want to?
i'm having some friends over .
it'll be fun .
i can't .
i got plans .
and that means that this goes hand in hand with ... the latex condom .
for it to be effective ...
oh , man ! it needs to be pulled down all the way .
god , that was like a bad dream .
well , every man needs a dream .
and mine is to become the next virgil doolittle .
you know what he got expelled for?
he stole gilmore's neck .
that's right .
cooper gilmore has no neck all because of virgil doolittle .
he got arrested .
and was charged with mayhem .
how cool is that?
the man's a legend .
the man went to prison .
allegedly .
and besides , who cares?
it's been 21 years and doolittle lives on .
a recent survey showed that most women do prefer a man of danger .
what's up , cosmo?
how's it going?
cool .
what's up?
do you think accordion players have groupies?
i mean , really good ones?
why do you ask?
it's three weeks to prom .
that's right .
i don't know .
i think it might be kind of nice to go .
i figured , who better to go with than my lifelong neighbor ... best buddy and partner in crime?
no prospects?
have you seen me with any lately?
are you gonna make me beg?
yeah , maybe a little .
i guess you'll have to go stag with floyd and the boys .
no .
you got yourself a date .
thanks , ryan .
i should be thanking you .
good night .
here we go , woodman .

woodman , my ass !
you got no lumber .
you got no stick .
it's maggie .
maggie's fine .
dig in now here .
closer .
i know everything there is to know about maggie .

it'd be like kissing my sister .
which isn't a terrible thing in some parts of the world .
walk it off .
come on now , next .

eleventy seven?
close enough .

yeah .
the coach hit ya .

yeah , man , what's up with that little sassy?
why do you ask?
maybe i'm interested .
in maggie carter .
trust me .
i've known her my whole life .
she's not your type .
well , ashley grant's not yours either , but i could hook you up .
home style got the hook up .
who says i'm into ashley grant?
come on !
i seen you checking her out all year .
just thought i could help you out .
what's the catch?
why has there gotta be a catch?
i don't know .
because you haven't said dick to me in four years and now you're helping me .
you're right .
i don't know you .
you don't know me .
but prom's coming up .
i'm into maggie .
you're into ashley .
she ever mention me?
bitch !
so what makes you think i have a chance in hell with her?
you don't .
but ashley's my cousin , and i can help you .
same goes for me with maggie .
i don't know .
why maggie?
you could date any girl in the school .
but maggie's special .
i can tell .
what do you say?
you be me ... and i'll be you .
i need to talk to you .
deal .
deal .
do you know what this means?
you're validating our entire species here .
i'm serious .
this is like lyle lovett and julia roberts .
quasimodo and the notre dame chick .
tommy lee and  everybody .
yeah .
of course , he's somewhat gifted .
studies show 84 % of all women polled prefer technique to physical size .
don't tell me you can't grasp the greatness of this?
you compared me to the hunchback .
next to ashley grant , you kind of are .
i'd like to hunch her back .
ashley's gonna love this .
i can't send her that .
you just did .
she's gonna hate me , man .
exactly .
i sent maggie poetry from you .
listen .
every guy in school wants to say something nice to ashley grant .
big deal .
you gotta stand out .
be different .
yeah , but , " your hair looks butch "?
it'll work .
ryan , your mom's heading this way .
cosmo , get your hand off the friggin 'dick .
now don't worry .
hey , girls .

we got ourselves an occasion .
the things i do for you .
you realize we're gonna be the biggest idiots in there?
we're finally here !
thanks , dad .
no , we won't .
excuse my tardiness .
i had to kill a man .
cosmo , what the hell are you wearing?
floyd said to dress up .
i look good , right?
we're in .
smells like teen spirit , huh?
drink !
is this what you had in mind?
yes .
darn .
that's what i was gonna wear .
care to dance?
go ahead .
that's okay .
why not?
he's gotta take a shit .
you see , ashley , i had to i don't know them .
what's he all dressed up for?
his mom died .
earlier today .
ladies , sit tight .
so , she says , " true or false?
and i said , " hello .
news flash .
if you have to ask , false .
she's such a liar .
so the liar .
then she said , " i can't believe you're acting like this .
and i said , " i can't believe you're dressing like this .
marnie , is that my dress?
she knows you're here .
she wants to talk .
it's all good .
i'm on this .
sloane got drunk and made out with that hairy guy .
you're lying !
you know you made out with him .
whatever , marnie .
did you get my e mail?
oh , my god .
was that you?
did you get my words?
poetry .
i didn't know you had it in you .
a little surprise .
you liked it?
pretty freaky stuff .
get you hot?
what?
oh , man .
that was whack .
jesus !
hey , chris .
thanks for your help .
yeah , like carter really liked your crap .
see what just happened?
people saw that .
damn , man , you're too cocky .
what?
i saw you groping her .
it doesn't matter what i write .
maggie's not gonna go for that .
she volunteers at a nursing home , for god's sake .
why?
that's what i'm talking about .
grant isn't exactly all hot for you either .
see , that's great .
the idea was " ryan impresses ashley .
not " ryan depresses ashley .
ryan gets pickle in ashley .
not , ashley gets ryan in a pickle .
look , man , chicks dig assholes , okay?
i mean , check out stu and harris .
they're both gonna get laid tonight .
i'll show you .
let's find ashley .
get away !
you know you like it .
remember in grade school when you always picked on the girl you liked?
it's kind of like that .
some girls are just insecure .
you're saying ashley grant is insecure .
she's the head cheerleader of insecurity .
and if i treat her bad , she'll go for it?
absolutely .
come on .
that doesn't make any sense .
what , you've dated how many of these girls?
that's what i thought .
now check out grant .
do you want her or not?
well , yeah , but  okay .
there you go .
now you're in the game .
you asshole !
i got something for ya !
forget it .
i'm out of here .
how could you have done this?
this was cashmere !
how could you do that?
'cause i'm an asshole?
move , jerk !
asshole !
what are you doin ', man?
those chicks were diggin 'us .
it's him .
wanna see the rest of the house?
this isn't working .
sure it is .
grant asked me about 20 times if the e mail guy was right about her hair?
even if everything you said is true , i don't want to be mean to her .
right .
seeing as how she's so sweet to you .
listen .
you know what ashley said to me tonight?
she's looking for something special .
i can get you there .
you can be that guy for her .
you just have to help me be that guy for maggie .
i thought i was being abducted .
how come you bagged on the party?
i had better things to do .
like sleep .
you should try it .
i talked to chris campbell .
i bet that was educational .
actually , it was .
he's not that bad , once you get past the jock stuff .
he asked about you .
yeah , i got some goofy e mail from him .
you didn't like it?
i mean , did you write him back?
be serious .
why not?
you haven't been on a date in like forever .
you think i enjoy asking you to prom?
hanging out with the guys every weekend?
i thought you liked hanging with us?
yeah , some weekends .
okay?
some .
then e mail him .
why not send him the famous " maggie carter soul quiz "?
right .
that'd be good for a laugh .
maybe .
but maybe he'll ace it .
then you won't have to spend another miserable weekend with me .
you know what i meant .
yeah , i know .
good morning .
what's up?
you guys get dressed in the dark?
it's mismatch day .
so maybe i should go home and change .
you and ashley grant , i think that's your mismatch , buddy .
opposites do attract .
thanks , cosmo .
probably not that opposite .
carter sent me like this midterm , you know , like questions .
i know .
it's a soul quiz movies , books , music .
if you can pass it , you're a new man .
famous .
there is one small hitch .
you do realize ashley grant hates me .
clear the pool .
man , she doesn't hate you .
she's confused by you .
she's trying to act like she doesn't care .
but believe me , brian , she cares more than you think .
she just can't figure you out .
it's driving her nuts .
you're this new guy " brian " who's not into her for some reason .
but i'm not brian .
hey , brian .
there they are !
step off .
what a doofus .
you girls are hot .
what's up , dudes?
who's the gerbil?
i'm floyd .
ryan's friend .
the chicks want me .
you got a soul quiz to take .
do you wanna see what i'm writing?
no , man .
just make me look good .
not too cocky .
is everything okay?
the last book he read was nine stories .
salinger .
wow .
it gets worse .
the beastie boys , the eels and old cheap trick .
he aced it .
movies?
stripes , casablanca and anything by monty python .
that's great .
no , it's not .
it's horrible .
chris campbell .
maggie , it's not that bad .
not that bad .
man , he's gorgeous .
what am i gonna do?
you mean after tonight's double date?
not a chance .
why not?
because as far as i can see ... there is nothing special about this person .
that's what he said about you .
he did not .
i'm serious .
he said those things .
he really likes you , okay?
it's just one date .
trust me .
trust me .
i'm really a man .
when a chick goes on a talk show ... with her fianc and has a deep , dark secret ... has it ever been anything other than , " i'm really a man "?
i mean , seriously .
your fianc invites you on tv to tell you something , she's packin 'sausage .
i gotta get ready .
i know .
listen .
that's why i'm calling .
be careful tonight .
pat her down before you get in the car .
just be sure .
hold on .
i got another call .
so what?
let it go .
it might be chris .
inbreed !
i'm sorry .
i can't do this .
i'm calling chris .
what?
maggie , you have to .
it just doesn't feel right .
what doesn't feel right?
he passed the soul quiz .
maggie , i need your help .
no , you don't .
you're gonna be fine .
sorry .
what kind of mongrel leaves a guy on call waiting?
i can't .
i gotta go .
cosmo says to check for an adam's apple , all right?
talk .
hey , chris?
that's me .
hey , it's maggie .
listen .
i'm calling you about tonight .
you hold on one second?
yeah .
talk .
maggie's gonna call .
don't answer .
i already did .
shit !
she wants to cancel the date .
yeah , the soul quiz?
she liked all that stuff .
i don't know what happened .
maybe she's nervous .
nervous stomach?
yeah .
probably the pill .
put me on hold and i'll try to talk you through this .
but you gotta keep coming back to me .
now let's start with , " i was really looking forward to seeing you tonight .
we seem to have a lot in common .
yadda , yadda .
no , i don't think , " bitch , we had plans " will work .
hold on .
sorry about the wait .
it's cool .
great .
that's my other line .
can you hold on a second?
what happened?
your mom fell down the stairs !
what?
mrs. carter , are you okay?
chris , can i call you back?
talk .
i just bought us a few seconds .
dude , let it go .
she's not going .
she's is going .
tell her you need to talk to a friend tonight .
why?
you're depressed .
your grades suck .
your father's on crack .
my dad played pro football .
perfect .
you're gettin 'your ass kicked .
i don't know what your problem is .
she's back .
don't screw this up .
hold on .
sorry .
hello?
chris , are you there?
yeah , i'm here ... baby .
are you okay?
'cause you sound kind of different .
yeah , well
yeah , see , the batteries are runnin 'low on my wireless .
i have to put you on speaker .
can you hang on?
just a second .
sorry about that .
can you hear me now?
yeah , sort of .
listen .
i hope you're not sick .
well , you know , i'm sick about this not happening .
i mean ...
i know i'm a jock .
i'm brainless ... conceited , in love with myself .
or that's how you must see me .
but let me tell you how i see you .
the you i see ... has a big heart .
she's smart , fun to hang around with ... doesn't take my shit .
and i like that .
i like that you look nervous sometimes for no reason .
and when you do , you bite your lip .
i like that you probably ... rifled through your closet tonight ... and settled with what you started out with .
i like your smile .
you know ...
i don't usually talk this way , but ...
i think being with you ... wouldn't be irrelevant .
you know what i'm saying?
or maybe i should stop with all this weak shit .
no , it's nice .
oh .
all right .
so let's do this , huh?
you know , no pressure .
we'll go hang out , the four of us .
get to know each other .
maybe talk .
maybe
swap some spit .

tell her her breath is rank .
i'm not tellin 'her that .
whatever , man .
i'm tellin 'carter she needs a titjob .
i'm just pullin 'your dick .
what do you want me to say?
why don't you just be the strong silent type?
if you decide to talk to her , be nice , all right?
tell her she looks nice .
tell her you like her outfit .
okay .
and you should probably tell grant her ass looks big in those jeans .
you look nice .
i like your clothes .
thanks .
you want some?
oh , my god .
there's the octopus .
come on , marge .
there's no line .

i've told you a million times , you've gotta get a faster modem .
so , you know , you were right , that e mail you sent me .
my hair looks terrible .
no , no , your hair doesn't look terrible .
but it hides your eyes .
you have really amazing eyes , really pretty ... wandering
besides , compared to your jeans , your hair's a work of art .
so , it's really great that you like the eels .
other than ryan , i really don't know anyone else who likes 'em .
the eels .
oh , yeah , yeah .
they're ... electric .
i can't believe you don't like these jeans .
they were really expensive .
even worse .

it's the rhinestones , isn't it?
for starters .
who else do you like?
well , i like you .
mommy , can i have some cotton
anything else you don't like about me?
i could do without those shoes .

yeah .
she loves it .
i'll make you look great .
hey , man , is ashley okay?
she's a little different than i expected .
what , you go out with your dream girl and you don't like her?
it's not that .

she's nervous .
she gets that way when she really , really likes somebody .
you gonna play with us today?
touch football , right?
of course .
get up , man .
she's watching .
time out .
i thought you said this was touch football .

in a very different way than anyone else .
you know , i should be pissed at you .
you should be pissed at me?
for making me fall for chris .
he's great .
i mean , he tries to put on this big , jerky act .
then he has these amazing moments .
so he's okay?
yeah , he's okay .
you know , i can remember summer nights when i was younger ... just lying in bed and listening to your father play the accordion for your mom .
melt with you .
it was her favorite .
i can remember feeling so safe and happy listening to that song .
just wondering if one day someone would be that good to me .
he used to say he played every note just for her .
this feels so strange .
you know , me and chris .
you and ashley .
it's almost like somebody messed with fate .
i'm gonna call it a night .
he'd be proud of you , you know ... your father .

i wonder if maggie and chris have done it yet .
could we not talk about her?
oh , well .
if they haven't , they will .
then chris will dump her like all the others .
you know , we could do this some other time .
maybe when you're more up to it .
casablanca , it works .

hey , chris , you got a second?
no , i gotta go and meet carter for some quality time .
oh .

i'll just pay for it myself .
loser !

she just is a loser .
then what would make her a winner?
hello?

a tiger can't just change his spots .
all right?

she is a fatty , round , little waitress , okay?
now , you tell me what could make her become a winner .
okay , i'll tell you how .
tell me .
i will .
tell me .
i will , if you'd stop your petty , self important whining for one second .
you know what?
i can't do this anymore .
is this because of the cake?
because i didn't like the cake?
you know what .
i'm sorry .
i loved the cake .
everyone , i loved the cake .
could you try the cake
it's not the cake !
then i don't understand why you're mad .
i know you don't , and that's the goddamn of it , is that you really don't know .
but then you said so yourself .
a tiger can't change his spots .
i'm scared .
yeah .
look , here's five for the cake .
five to buy a clue .
this is over .
i love you , brian ryan .
so , dude , when's the wedding anyways?
you picked out your dress yet?
shit .
you fags be ready come prom night ... for the chris campbell nail and bail .
nice rhyme .
make that up all by yourself?
i'll catch you guys later , okay?
so?
so , how does this work anyway?
the old nail and bail?
like you don't know .
i saw grant this morning blubbering like a whale .
so?
so you didn't try to sleep with her?
it wasn't like that .
you see , it is like that .
no , it isn't , because you never cared about maggie .
neither did you .
i cared about her .
don't look so surprised , partner .
nail and bail's crushed far greater chicks than carter .
there is not a chance in hell maggie sleeps with you .
she's better than that !
maybe she used to be , but then you stepped in and changed all that .
didn't you , brian?
it is " ryan . " it's not " brian .
doesn't really matter , does it?
get in that box now , sue ann !
have you seen maggie?
i'm not talking to you , jack hole .
well , well , well , what have we got here?
someone trying on some pants?
listen .
you can be pissed at me if you want to .
that's fine .
i deserve it .
just tell me if you've seen her .
not since you scared her off bird dogging for sniff .
what is this , some ladies 'afternoon tea?
walk it off .
what are you guys doing at my house?
what happened between you and ashley?
is there someone else?
was it the hair on her back?
'cause she is getting that removed .
that hair .
isn't there anything that she can do?
look , short of camping on my lawn and begging profusely , no .
i cut out today and bought it .
for prom .
what do you think?
i think it's great .
yeah?
i mean , it's ... perfect .
do you think chris will like it?
you know ... are you sure about him?
i mean , are you really sure?
what are you talking about?
chris .
i wanted ashley grant .
so?
so , i told him what to say to you .
the e mails , the nursing home ... and he helped me out with ashley .
i'm sorry , maggie .
i don't believe you .
when you're alone with him , face to face ... does he ever say anything clever or funny or even sincere?
he's shy .
he's not shy .
he's a dumb ass .
in the theater ...
i said you were beautiful me .
i meant it .
because ...
i have feelings for you .
you're really pathetic , do you know that?
maggie , i  no .
i'm sorry , if things didn't work out for you , but ... you think you could tear me and chris down because ashley broke up with you?
listen .
no , because honestly ...
i don't even see that guy you used to be anymore , ryan .
i see a liar ...
brian .
if you run your mascara , it's gonna look really bad .
would one of you whores please get me a tissue?
you can see her ass .
it's the twosome .
they're gonna get it on .
oh , it's a threesome .
hey , did you guys hear the theme for the prom?

but they have become legends .

i wonder where ash went tonight .

that's great .
see if you can find your face in there , okay?
don't be a shit to your date .
come on .
let's dance .
mom , come on !
shut up and dance with your mother .
you know , it's getting late .
you're getting old .
it's early yet .

it's later than you think .
gentlemen , the hour is nigh .
what's " nigh "?
i don't know .
but i gotta go find my date .
no , no , no , over here .
i thought we were gonna dance .
oh , we are .
no , we're definitely gonna dance .

jack?
it's mayhem .
it's chaos .
nobody saw anything .
did you see anything?
no , sir .
i did .
he's the bastard .
he planned the whole thing himself .
you fink !
they'll never take me alive !
let's get him .
never !
get down .
hands behind your back .
textbook take down , huh , men?
make sure you rough me up in front of the honeys .
hold up , guys .
i got this one .
thanks , man .
i heard his father's in prison .
i heard he slept with the school nurse .
he's hot !
he's boiling !
take me to the hotel , driver .
sheesh .
somebody's in a hurry for some loving .
chris , this night is really important to me , okay?
it's important to me too .
why don't you lie on the bed and make yourself a little more comfortable?
good idea .
this is it .
on your back , stallion .
look , we got all night , right?
yes , we do .
why don't you just wait here and i'll go get us some champagne .
forgot something .
hurry back .
hey , do they have a jail out here in the woods?
damn , these knots are pretty tight .
summer camp .
oh , god .
where good girls go bad .
this isn't like one of those games ... when you give me a 30 second head start and then hunt me down , is it?
don't move .
because i'm really slow ... and not very cunning .
i'm sure you'd have me in like 45 seconds tops .
have you seen maggie carter?
who knew you were such a freak?
i'm surprised you didn't .
i mean , you know so many other things about me ...
like my favorite movie .
casablanca .
you know my favorite book .
n n nine stories .
by the way ... which one's your favorite ... of the nine stories , hmm?
the long one .
sorry , chris .
wrong answer .
carter , you're sort of starting to creep me out here .
there's just one more question .
how's it feel to be played?
what?
smile now , prom date .
you know , chris , there's one thing you're right about .
what we do tonight is probably how we'll be remembered .
is that
chris , yeah .
tell your friends .
don't say a word .
just have me .
you do know that ... people will be looking for me and
this is really all virgil doolittle's fault .
sure , i wanna be a legend and all , but
i was just joking around .
pulling a prank , all right?
you should really think about it .
your future .
okay , i'll do that .
thank you .
maggie , i need to talk to you .
what , lying and cheating weren't enough?
now you're breaking and entering?
ow .
the prince ascends my balcony ...
looks deeply into my eyes and says , " ow .
how romantic .
you didn't let me finish .
i meant , " ow .
that really hurts like hell .
but not near as bad as losing you .
or knowing that i can't take it back .
look , i wish i could .
you lied to me .
you steered me right into that world .
made me feel like i belonged .
you do belong .
you belong with me .
talk is cheap .
if there's one thing i've learned from all this , it's that .
if i let you off the hook , do you know how much you owe me?
i do .
the things i do for you .
got your neck back for you , gilmore .
