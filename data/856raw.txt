we're not the only people on this island , and we all know it !
maybe it's time we stopped blaming us and started worrying about them !
they came the first night , took three of us , then they came back and took nine more .
they're smart , and they're animals , and they could be anywhere at anytime , and if you think that one gun and one bullet is gonna stop them ... think again .

that's him , sergeant .
let's go , hombre .
son , we don't want to be here any more than you do , and your pal saddam had to go marchin 'into kuwait , so here we all are .
buccelli here says you speak english .
you ever do any translatin '?
formally?
no .
hell , fact you know what " formally " means , well , we're good .
apache helicopter went down in this sector two days ago .
our sources tell us the pilot was captured .
it's very important that we get this pilot back .
we know he was taken to the local republican guard intelligence commander a man named tariq .
do you know him?
yes , he was our commanding officer .
you know where he is?
when the bombing started , he fled to hillah .
hillah , huh?
yes , that is right .
welcome to hillah .
where's jack?
why?
there .
see?
go back .
i'll deal with this .
what?
go back , ana lucia , and don't tell anyone what you saw .
what are you doing here , danielle?
looking for you .
where are we going?
you said you were looking for me .
what was your plan to hide in the woods , hoping i would pass you by?
i was going to wait until dark , then find you at your tent .
why?
we need to keep moving .
not until you tell me where we're moving to .
trust me .
the last time we met , you arrive to warn us the others were coming , which they weren't .
in fact , it was a diversion to kidnap claire's baby , so pardon me for not trusting you .
this place i'm taking you to there is something that will help you , something important .
so trust .
take this .
if i'm lying , it's yours to use .
how much further?
not far .
ask him where he took the pilot .
they want to know where the pilot is .
tell him his mother is a goat .
he says he does not know .
look , we know for a fact he interrogated the pilot day before yesterday hell , probably in this room .
tell him we get our man back safe and sound , he goes free .
they will let you go if you tell them where the pilot is .
you are a disgrace .
you're an iraqi soldier !
steal his gun and kill them all .
right there on his belt .
you can get a few of them before you are killed .
what's he saying?
he says he does not know .
i was born , but i wasn't born yesterday , son .
now you don't help me out here , someone else will take over , and that someone , he won't play nice at all .
i am sorry .
he does not know .
okay .
you had your chance .
g uards?
lock him back up .
this is unbelievable .
hey .
hey , you hear that thing?
you hear that frog?
the frog?
you want to help me find it?
what , we ain't friends anymore?
what do you got there , rerun?
nothin '.
yeah , well , you got a spot of " nothin '" on your chin , there .
dharma initiative ranch dressing .
you know , you're supposed to refrigerate that after you open it .
well , actually on the back it says it'll keep at room temperature for up to 7 years .
well , well , looky who's got a secret stash .
please , dude , you can't tell .
what , that you stole food from the group?
now why would i want to do that?
come on , man , please?
son of a bitch .
dude , it's just a tree frog .
have you seen it?
yeah .
tell you what you help me find that thing , you can keep right on ranch dippin '.
we got a deal?
how much further?
danielle?
we're here .
and where exactly is " here "?
what is that for , danielle?
help me !
hey !
over here !
wait .
help !
sayid , listen to me .
hey !
aah !
over here !
please !
help me !
help me !
don't believe a word he says .
hey !
he's one of them .
i have no idea what she's talking about .
she's crazy .
how long has he been up there?
since last night .
please , just cut me down .
my name is henry gale .
i'm from minnesota .
please .
he's lying .
i'm going to cut him down .
don't .
thank you .
you're making a serious mistake .
it's okay , it's okay .
you're all right .
you're all right .
hold on .
take it easy .
oh , no .
wait !
danielle , don't !
you could have killed him .
if i wanted to kill him , i would have killed him .
you shot this man with no provocation .
he is one of them !
tie him up .
you should take him to your doctor .
he's no good to you dead .
and then what?
you talk to him , sayid .
as i recall , that is what you do .
but know this he will lie .
for a long time , he will lie .
i want to talk to you about your buddy tariq .
all right , look , i get it .
you're a man who values loyalty .
even doing a little translating for us , you feel like you're doing the wrong thing .
i get that , and i respect it .
this is what tariq was doing before he took over command of your intelligence unit .
he was the head of a chemical warfare battalion in the north , personally supervised the use of sarin gas on this village .
you recognize it , don't you?
you had relatives in that village , didn't you , sayid?
so you know what sarin gas does .
no discrimination .
the entire marketplace .
innocent women ... children .
enough ...
please .
loyalty is a virtue , but unquestioning loyalty
i don't think that's you .
why should i believe you?
how do you think we knew you had relatives in that village?
we liberated your personnel file and tariq's .
all we want is our pilot back , so we can send him home to his family .
tariq will never talk to you .
that's why you're gonna have to make him talk to you .
john .
john , wake up .
what?
come out here .
minnesota , huh?
that's the question , isn't it?
where am i?
who are you?
henry .
henry gale .
aah !
my back !
we're going to take it out , but first i want you to relax .
how did you get to this island?
four months ago , we crashed , my wife and i.
crashed in what?
a balloon .
we were trying to cross the pacific .
your wife where is she?
she died .
she got ... she got sick three weeks ago .
we were staying in a cave off the beach .
my shoulder .
at least untie my arms !
what the hell is going on here?
rousseau trapped him in the jungle .
she believe she's an other .
an " other " what?
you shot him with an arrow?
do i have a bow?
hey , hey , you with me?
what , you were just gonna let him bleed to death?
i was trying to get honest answers while he was able to give them ... and his wound is far from life threatening .
we should let jack treat him first , then we'll get our answers .
jack ... do not untie him .
this is how people get killed in scary movies .
if it were a scary movie , i'd be with a hot chick , not you , barbar .
it's babar .
how about you shut up , hammo , or your ranch disorder's gonna be the new lead item on the coconut internet .
fine .
go ahead .
tell everyone the fat guy's been hiding ranch dressing , the fat guy who likes to eat .
yeah , i'm fat .
fat , fat , fat , fat , fat .
you think i don't know that?
at least people like me .
you know what?
find the damn frog by yourself .
hurley , wait !
wait !
hey , hurley !
look , man , i'm sorry , all right?
this frog is killin 'me .
you gotta help me out ...
please .
so what do you think?
what do you think , john?
i think he's pretty convincing .
yes , he is .
the real problem is there's no way we can be sure he's telling the truth .
that is not necessarily true .
does jack have the combination to the armory?
for now , he does .
how long would it take for you to change it?
if you're angry ,
looking for someone to punish ...
why would i need to punish anyone?
i want to find out who he is .
i want the truth .
and i think we both know that jack will have issues with what must be done in order to get it .
so how long , john , to change the combination?
a couple minutes , tops .
then i suggest you get started .
did he say anything while you were treat
no , he didn't .
he was in shock .
we can't just leave him layin 'here , jack .
people will see him and create a panic .
yeah?
well , where do you think we should put him?
i say we put him in the armory .
it's secure .
better to err on the side of safety , jack , at least until we can be sure .
okay .
for now .
all right , pull that cot in here .
he shouldn't be on his back .
good idea .
sayid !
hey , what the hell you doin '?
what needs to be done .
they're letting speak to me alone now?
you need to tell me where the helicopter pilot is .
this is their new bluff?
that you're going to torture me?
they think you will do this?
sayid , you are a loyal soldier .
the son of a great hero .
do not disgrace your father !
you wouldn't dare harm me !
you will follow my orders as your commanding officer !
take that bag .
put it over your head and tape it up .
kill yourself , now !
that's an order .
do it and die with what little honor you have left .
you would have me take my own life ... the information means nothing to you !
the pilot was executed two days ago .
he is buried in a field 4 kilometers from here .
i can take you there .
damn it .
sayid , open the door !
sayid , answer me !
jack .
why isn't this combination working , john?
did you change it?
yeah .
why would you do that?
you're raising an army .
what?
and why you didn't ask me to help , well , that's your business , but there's only one reason to raise an army , jack , and that's because we're at war .
and like it or not , whatever sayid has to do behind that door , that's a part of it , too .
what if he's telling the truth , john?
what if he's not?
get up .
what's happening?
here , let me help you .
you said you've been here for four months .
what?
you said you came to this island four months ago , yes?
where am i?
please answer my question .
yeah yes , we landed four months ago , maybe more .
who are you?
and you were in a cave for all that time?
off the beach ... on the north shore of the island .
how far from this beach to where you were captured?
i don't know .
how many days 'walk?
two two days .
why did you stay on the beach for so long?
why wouldn't we?
we wanted to be there for flyovers .
we had an emergency beacon a transmitter .
what kind of transmitter?
an a. d. f. beacon .
we wanted to make sure we'd be spotted .
look , whatever you think i am , i'm not .
please please just ... tell me your name .
you wife what is her maiden name?
murphy .
where did you meet her?
university of minnesota .
how did she die?
she got sick .
she got sick?
it started as a fever .
after two days , she was delirious ... then she died .
i don't know why you're asking me all these questions .
i don't know why you're treating me this way ... why i have to explain to you who i am when you don't tell me who you are .
i was 23 years old when the americans came to my country .
i was a good man .
i was a soldier ... and when they left ,
i was something different .
for the next six years ,
i did things i wish i could erase from my memory , things which i never thought myself to be capable of ... but i did come to learn this there is a part of me which was always capable .
you want to know who i am?
my name is sayid jarrah ... and i am a torturer .
where is it?
there it is .
gotcha .
dude , nice catch .
well , i'll be damned .
all that noise from this tiny critter .
kind of reminds me of a turtle i once had .
his name was stewart .
he ran off when i was 10 .
well , that's what mom said .
i kinda think she threw him out .
well , you're a happy little fella , ain't ya?
i have an idea .
why don't i take him far from here , two beaches away?
maybe i'll finda mrs.
tree frog .
that way , he won't keep you up anymore , and everyone's happy .
yeah , that's one idea .
here's another .
dude .
i hear with a little ranch , they taste just like chicken .
give you a hand?
jack , i know this  shut up .
where are the pliers?
tell me about this balloon .
what?
this balloon that brought you here with your wife tell me about it .
what do you want to know?
everything .
she's 140 feet high , 60 feet wide ... and when she's up in the air , 550, 000 cubic feet of helium and 100, 000 of hot air keep her up .
and if you could look down on her , you'd see a big , yellow smiley face on top .
why would you travelin that way?
because i was rich , because ... it was my dream ...
and jennifer thought it would be neat .
you were rich .
i guess i'm thinking of things in the past tense now .
how's that for optimism?
what did you do to become so rich?
i sold my company .
what kind of company?
mining .
what did you mine?
we mined nonmetallic minerals .
i know , everyone wanted to talk to me at cocktail parties .
give me your hands .
give me your hands !
where is she buried?
what?
listen to me .
you said you buried your wife .
tell me where .
what are you gonna  wwhere? !
in the jungle !
by the balloon , in the jungle .
how deep?
how deep did you dig the grave?
i don't ...
how deep?
how many shovelfuls of earth?
did you use your hands?
how long did it take you? !
i don't remember !
you would remember !
you would remember how deep !
you would remember every shovelful , every moment !
you would remember what it felt like to place her body inside .
you would remember if you buried the woman you loved .
you would remember , if it were true !
did you ... did you lose someone?
did you lose someone here on the island?
did you lose someone , too?
what happened to her?
it was an accident .
it was an accident .
the woman responsible thought she was someone else , someone coming to hurt her .
someone like you !
just just this is all a mistake .
slow down here , okay?
hurting me isn't gonna bring her back .
you know what i lost !
tell me the truth !
tell me who you are !
no !
no !
no !
help !
stop !
tell me the truth !
tell me who you are !
sayid !
sayid !
jack .
open it .
open it now .
jack , this has to happen .
open that damn door , you understand me? !
you open it now !
no .
now !
what do you want me to say? !
whatever you want me to do , i'll do it !
just please ...
i want you to tell me the truth !
open the door .
let go of me , jack .
or what?
you want to pushthe button?
open the door .
it's under a minute now , john .
you better think fast .
you wouldn't .
what?
i wouldn't what?
if we don't ... you would risk everyone's lives?
you talked me into pushing that button once , john , but it's yours now .
you're the onewho won't risk it , you .
me?
i don't think anything's gonna happen when we get down to zero .
jack ...
you want to see what's gonna happen?
let's just see what's gonna happen .
who are you? !
who are you? !
okay , okay , okay , right , 15 , left
you think i'm stupid?
you open it !
he's lying !
not like this !
i'll tell you whatever you want !
he's lying !
he's lying !
that's enough !
what the hell was that?
he is one of them .
yeah?
did he tell you that?
no .
then how do you know?
because i know .
he is one of them .
i think that's what rousseau thought about you once , sayid .
if i'm not mistaken , she strapped you down , she shocked you , all because she thought you were one of them .
he is .
what?
he is one of them .
to rousseau , we're all " others .
i guess it's all relative , huh?
you got a wife?
kids?
i'll take him .
it's over .
we're pulling out , not going to baghdad .
so your man saddam gets to stay in power , which means you , in all likelihood , will remain in his employ .
guess you're lucky to have a new skill set you can use .
what you made me do , no human being should ever have to do to another .
one of these days ... there will be something you need to know .
and now ... you know how to get it .
i will never do that again .
yeah .
good luck to you , sayid .
bus fare back to ramadi .
let's move out .
there is a man down in the hatch ... a stranger captured by rousseau .
i beat him .
i beat him badly .
why are you telling me this , sayid?
jack asked me how i knew knew for sure that this man was lying , how i knew for sure that he was one of them , one of the others .
i know because i feel no guilt for what i did to him .
but there is no way i can ever explain that to jack or even locke ... because both of them have forgotten .
forgotten?
what?
that you were strung up by your neck and left for dead , that claire was taken and kept for days , during which god only knows what happened to her , that these people , these " others " , are merciless ... and can take any one of us whenever they choose .
so tell me , charlie .
have you forgotten?
