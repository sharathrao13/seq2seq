so , what did jack lauderdale have to say?
oh , i clocked him comin 'out the gate .
he's a two bit hustler .
oh , i see .
yeah , turns out the only hit that swing time ever had was open the door , richard , which was a joke record .
uh uh uh , what about him recordin 'me?
oh , he'll record you , if we pay the freight .
scratch a liar , find a thief .
what's that supposed to mean?
this .
you see i saw jack lauderdale tonight , and he gave me a $500 advance on my record .
he also said he'll put me on the road with lowell fulson and pay me three times what you pay .
now , that's a lie !
hey , no way he's not gonna put some blind man on the road .
think about it .
i mean , you you need watchin 'out for .
and he ain't got the time to look after you the way i do .
is that what you've been doing , gossie?
watchin 'out for me?
is that why you get paid double what i do?
who told you that?
it's true , ain't it?
you two have been gaming me since i got here .
ray , baby , listen i ain't listening to you !
ray , i've i've been meaning to talk to you about that .

every club we hit , it's your responsibility to rehearse the band .
these are some lazy ass bastards , so you gotta make sure that they don't slough off .
you gotta be ready and dressed to open the show .
now , lowell likes to take a nap before he goes on .
you just do your thing until he feels like comin 'out .
and when lowell's playin ', you keep the band sharp .

did jack tell you that i have to be paid in singles?
you just do your job , you're gonna get your money .

mr. charles , my name is ahmet ertegun .
may i have a moment of your time?
what do you want , man?
i'm at church .
i'm sorry .
i'll come back later .
you're here now .
what do you want?
my company , atlantic records , has acquired your contract from swing time .
i'd like to discuss your future .
hold on .
don't jive me now .
i ain't for sale .
may i sit down?
you see , mr. charles ,
jack lauderdale has found himself , shall we say , a little overextended , and has had to unload some of his talent .
when your name came up , i jumped at the chance to work with you .
i'm a big fan .
what if i want to go to another company?
there's a guy out there right now that is willing to pay me seven cents a record .
can you do that?
man , i could promise you 15 cents a record , but you won't get it any more than he'll pay you seven .
what i will do is promise you five cents a record and pay you five cents a record .
if you think pennies , mr. charles , you get pennies .
you think dollars , you get dollars .
i like how you put things together , man .
ahem , you know what?
omelet , you're all right with me .
ahmet .
ahmet .
what kind of name is that?
i'm turkish .
well , you know what?
i guess jack lauderdale's bad luck is my good fortune .
i knew that atlantic records was bigger than swing time .
you guys do good music .
i dig atlantic .
you could have fooled me .
well , you know , i gotta keep my eye on you city boys .
down home , we call it " country dumb .
hey , man , it ain't turkish .
what do you think?

ahmet , it's just like charles brown .
okay , i'll talk to him .
all right , fellas , that's a cut .
that's a cut , fellas .
fellas !
band can take five .
he just don't get it .
you either sound original , or you got nothin '.
ahmet , what'd you think of that?
ray , i want to tell you something , and i don't want you to take it wrong .
then give it to me right .
i signed you because i sensed something special in you not because you sound like nat cole or charles brown .
i thought you like what i do .
we we love the timbre of your voice , we like your virtuosity , your energy
but not my music .
come on , man , i didn't say that .
ahmet , this is what i do , man .
i gotta make a living .
this is what the people want .
i don't know no other way .
we got to help you find one .
look , let's try a little change of pace , okay?
you're familiar with stride piano?
you kidding me , man?
the man who i learned the piano from is a stride player .
okay , i got a song .
it's called the mess around .
the mess around .
cute title .
who wrote it?
i did .
ah , you wrote it .
yeah .
well , sing it to me , man .
sing it?
yeah .
it ain't like i can read the lyrics .
okay .
well , it's the key of g.
okay .
key of g.
uh huh .
yeah .
yeah , but it's a kind of pete johnson thing .
pete johnson .
yeah , yeah , that's it .
you like that?
here we go .
two , three , four .
all right , that's good .
let me take it from here .
now we got something !
that's all right there .
what do you think , ahmet?
great , ray !
unbelievable !
who's that?
ray , i want you to meet my new partner , jerry .
mr. ray charles , jerry wexler .
hey .
don't worry , ray .
i'm going to step back , i'm gonna watch ,
i'm gonna learn how to produce a record .
i'm in awe .
that was out of sight .
that's some running and riffing , man !
well , this'll make you shout , man .
we're listening to that new recording , mess around by atlantic recording artist , ray charles .
and we have the gentleman live here in the kcoh studios .
so , ray , when you're not making your own music , what do you listen to?
you know what , the fact is , king bee , i really and truly love gospel .
one of my favorite groups is from right here in houston : the cecil shaw singers .
ray charles endorses houston's own cecil shaw .
we'll be playing gospel all day sunday but right now , let's hear some more of that mess around by ray charles .
k. b. , line 1 .
king bee .
mmm hmm .
yeah , he's right here .
miss della antwine of the cecil shaw singers .
hello , miss antwine .
you sung tenor in jesus is my shepherd , right?
yes .
how did you pick me out?
actually , i i hear like you see .
like that hummingbird outside the window , for instance .
i can't hear her .
you have to listen .
yes .
yeah .
yes , you can .
oh oh .
you hear that?
what?
her heart just skipped a beat .
oh , did you like my record?
the one that king bee was playin '?
it was very nice .
different than the others .
i've heard a lot of your music .
was it very nice , too?
look , miss antwine , if you don't really like the record , you ain't got to beat around the bush with me .
i mean , my mama never did .
it's not that i don't enjoy your music .
it's just that i feel i've heard it before .
i keep wondering what the real ray charles sound like .
ray charles?
who's he?
nobody , if you don't know .
huh?
sorry .
i should have kept my mouth shut .
oh , no , no .
then you wouldn't be you .
you know , it's not like i haven't heard that before .
i guess i just , uh , never really listened , that's all .
ain't nobody ever put it that sweet , i guess .
you know what , miss della bea antwine?
you really are a country girl .
you know that?
yes .
how'd you know?
i could tell by the way you ordered .
let me get molasses with my cornbread .
were you raised on a farm?
my mother did a little sharecropping in florida .
is she still there?
god bless her heart , she passed away when i went to school .
ray , i'm sorry .
she never was real healthy .
she just worked herself to death , poor thing .
that's why she didn't want me carrying around no tin cup .
the kids i went to school with , they were doing basket weavin 'and wickerwork .
but not you .
because of your gift .
because of my ears .
see , i can mimic damn near anybody , and i i i i make a pretty decent living at it .
it's just , if i change my style up and people really don't dig it ,
i mean , what am i left with , you know?
i mean , when you're blind , miss antwine , you ain't got that many choices .
seem to me like you got all the choices in the world .
god gave you the gift to sound
like anybody you please , even yourself .
we're here .
this is where i live .
well , you think the preacher'd let me in?
i mean , uh , i'm a sinner , but i need a little prayer .
his wife don't like me having male company .
well , tell him there's a soul out here that needs savin '.
you know what , miss antwine , you really got me thinkin '.
about what?
about my life .
about my music .
about everything .
ray , don't don't you think we're movin 'a little fast?
listen , i'm i'm gonna go to new york for a couple of weeks , and when i get back , you can take it as slow as you want .
all right , mr. charles .
all right , miss antwine .
i'll see you in a couple of weeks .
well , hold on , now .
let me call you a cab .
i got it .
three blocks up ,
left for two , right for one .
fifteen giant steps , and i'm at the crystal white hotel .
hello .
mess around was a positive step for us , ray .
we're making progress .
oh , come on , ahmet .
now , you've been nice to me .
but i haven't given you guys any hits .
atlantic records has been good to me , but if you want me to do something special ,
i'm gonna need my own band .
oh , man .
taking a band out on the road costs a mint , ray .
i mean , even joe morris is struggling .
his band's had a hit record .
but , ahmet , listen , i'm not joe morris .
man , you told me if i think pennies , i get pennies .
i'm thinking dollars , man .
ruth brown's got a tour booked in georgia .
she needs a band .
i i'll take it .
i could write the charts for her , i i could do backup , and also be an openin 'act .
okay .
but you're going to be financially responsible .
you're gonna have to make it work , ray .
yeah , yeah , i'm gonna make it do what it do , baby .
yeah .
ray !
miss antwine , it's been two weeks .
it's been three .
now , where's the preacher at?
and the wife?
they in dallas till monday .
well , hallelujah !
della bea .
kind of like a honey bee , right?
can i call you bea?
yeah , i'd like that .
there's only been two cats that i ever really trusted in my life .
there's jeff brown , he's going to be my tour manager ,
fathead newman , my tenor man and now you .
but you gotta do me a favor .
bea , you gotta always tell me the truth .
oh , yeah .
just like you did before .
don't feel sorry for me just 'cause i'm blind .
how could i pity someone i admire?
can i play something for you?
now?
yeah .
no , ray .
yeah , right now .
right now .
i'm gonna ...
ray !
it's right there .
you got it .
okay .
yeah , yeah , this will work .
now you go ahead and play .
i'm gonna close these drapes .
all right .
i don't want no neighbors looking in .
ray .
ray !
ray .
ray , that's sacrilegious .
what what?
it's a gospel song .
i know what it is .
i wrote it .
i mean , you told me to find my own voice .
well , bea , this is it .
but it it ain't it ain't right to be changing gospel music into this .
into what?
is it is it devil music?
evil music?
do you think do you think i'm evil , bea?
look , i've been performing gospel and blues all my life .
it's who i am .
and if i'm gonna do my own thing , i i gotta be natural , right?
i'm singing about my feelings for you .
about how i love you .
what could be more natural than that?
huh , bea?
tell me .
more natural than me and you .
ray .
so we bite the bullet , we cancel the tour dates .
but what the hell are we gonna tell ray?
ruth brown's pregnant , so there's no tour .
what about lavern baker?
get lavern baker to take the tour .
she doesn't have a record .
there's nothing to promote .
you and jesse get up there , write a couple of songs ,
let's get her in the studio .
it's gonna take a month to do that
what are we gonna do?
we got to do somethin '.
ray's got a whole new band up there .
how the hell did he put together a band so fast?
boss !
boss , they're here .
come on .
let's get together so we can show 'em this . ... break this to ray .
oh , you're gonna let me break it to ray?
why me?
because ruth brown was your idea .
ruth brown is a good idea , ruth brown was a good idea , and still is a good idea .
shh !
ahmet .
yeah .
we gotta get this on wax .
oh , yeah .
hear that , new york?
the sound is huge !
but there's only seven cats on this record .
this is the new ray charles , baby , and there's nothing out there like it !
and you heard it first on the moondog show !
the shaw agency's the best booker on the chitlin 'circuit , that's my opinion .
milt shaw , meet ray charles .
ray , it was milt's dad , billy , who first drew my attention to a certain blind pianist when he was booking lowell fulson .
ray charles .
we believe in your talent .
we wanna be in the ray charles business .
we've already got you booked on a 10 city tour with roy milton's solid senders
oh , roy milton , i love him . ... and tangula the exotic shake dancer .
she is gorgeous .
ray , i gotta tell you , we think you're onto something very big here .
nobody's ever combined r& b and gospel before .
i've got a woman is a smash .
you better start thinking about a follow up , my friend .
right now .
you know , this sounds good .
i gotta run to texas and take care of some business , and , i'll be right back .
well , make it fast .
i'm ready to sell , sell , sell .
a a as long as you book me in front of tangula .
della , hold on !

y'all , y'all , stay right there !
ray !
della , let me get one picture !
come on .

ray , you need some help?
you sure you know what you're doing?
ray .
ray .

h h hold on .

why are you locking doors on me , ray?
you know the place is small .
we gotta have a little privacy .
uh , what we need is a little more room .
you know , we're gonna need some space while we start a family .
well , bea , you know i'm gonna be on the road for most of the year .
ray .
i'm just thinking , what if i'm not a good father?
my daddy was never around .
and he had three different families .
well , you are gonna have one , starting right now .
right now?
mmm hmm .

all of y'all are going straight to hell !
she's right .
no , this here's wrong .
the whole thing's wrong .

you got a right to believe in what you believe .
you can go to hell by yourself !
boss , you want to cancel the show?
uh , no .
i'm not gonna cancel the show .
just find me a bari player by tomorrow .
if all of y'all want me to keep playing , let me hear you say " amen .
amen !
and while you're at it , find me a girl with church training that can sing but without the church attitude .
all right .
let's go , y'all .

that ain't medicine to nobody , ray .
don't be lyin 'to yourself .
it ain't like i'm dealing it , baby .
i just use it to get a little taste .
you don't taste poison , ray .
it kills you .
now , you got to stop .
i ain't got to do a goddamn thing !
what about me?
what about your baby?
bea .
it ain't like i'm new to this .
