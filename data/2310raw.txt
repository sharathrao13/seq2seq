soapbox leader , break it off .
home and tea .
for once you deserve it .
well done , everybody .
heinkel , three second burst .
starboard engine .
ruddy great flamer .
any identification marks?
yellow stripes on the wings .
wing leader .
see it go down?
did i?
nyaow ... plunk !
hmm .
graham and jack will confirm your story .
that's three of you who got him .
1/ 3 of a kill , laddie , 1/ 3 .
sir .
what did you hit?
a heinkel .
anyone see mine go in?
didn't know you were with us .
well done , peter .
only 1/ 3 of a one , sir .
oh , that's better than nothing .
i used to blast away and never hit a sausage .
one thing though ...
what's that , sir?
it takes us two years to train people like you .
suppose your controls had been damaged .
what would've happened to that idiotic victory roll?
you'd have been spread all over the damn field ...
like strawberry jam .
never again .
clear?
yes , sir .
something to make stuffy's day .
the old man's just gone down to the ops room with sasha .
final figures of the northern raids ... twenty three without loss .
jolly good .
i'll show it to him .
right .
we're getting 6 volunteer pilots from coastal command ... and from the fleet air arms , sir ... five from each of the fairday battle squadrons ... and three from army cooperation .
that's thirty , is it?
not enough .
we lost that many yesterday .
and the air staff hesitate to weaken the light bombers ... in case of invasion , sir .
we need pilots now .
what about the foreign squadrons under training?
czechs , poles?
i know your feelings about the language difficulties .
they don't understand a word that's said over the air .
they're a menace to themselves and us .
i'll try and cut more corners off the training program .
pilots are doing well ... enemy losing at the rate of two to one ... then he can afford to , can't he?
never sends more than half his bombers at one time .
we must find more pilots ... or lose .
begin .
this is off speed .
check 5 0 1 back at ready desk ...
i think you ought to see this , sir .
thank you .
air raid warning .
sector three red .
rabbit squadron .
tallyho , tallyho , red section .
we'll take the rear starboard .
yellow , you take the port .
yellow 1 wilco .
tallyho , yellow .
amaliel , keep your eyes open for the red squad .
rabbit leader , red 3 , you're on those bastards ...
six o'clock high .
coming down now .
roger , red 3 .
i see them .
rabbit , brave right and climb .
behind you , andy !
on your tail !
get out , andy !
jump !
hurry up !
out !
all out !
don't any of you joes talk english?
corporal !
sir !
where are you taking those vultures?
officers to the mess , ensigns to the guard room , sir .
like hell you are .
they're responsible for all that .
get them to clear it up .
but what about the officers?
give them a bloody shovel .
come on , step with it !
skipper hates jerries .
he'll hate me if you don't get that gun repaired .
then wrap up this little lot .
only eight for the morning?
got to do better than that .
five are write offs .
one has another guard gone , and two are missing , sir .
mr. anthony and sergeant moore .
and these two are hundred hour checks .
they've been at it for 48 hours solid , sir .
i know .
where the hell have you been? !
learning to swim .
do your best , blaine .
roger .
you get one?
all i got was a bellyful of english channel .
when are you going to learn?
i didn't know they were there .
never fly straight and level ... for more than thirty seconds in the combat area .
how many times have i told you?
come on , i'll give you a lift .
i'd rather walk , sir .
cut out the " sir .
you called your wife?
all right , boy .
get in .
here you are , sir .
thank you .
it's ridiculous !
we go up four or five times a day ... and every time we come down , more potholes .
there are more potholes until we can't bloody well get in a door .
we'll get this place operational again .
you won't .
not until someone decides ... to protect it while we're up .
what flaming genius thought of sending us ... to that dump of a flying club?
don't blame me .
direct orders from group .
park himself .
it's not a bad little field .
i've seen it .
damp tents ... and a nasty little shack full of dead flies .
at least you won't have the jerries visiting you .
i don't blame them .
how much longer , hobbes?
the engine's overheating , and so am i.
we either stand down or blow up .
which do you want?
hostile 1 6 , reconfirm , please .
need some more yellow sevens , flight .
this is r 29 , now forty plus .
1 5 .
yes .
2 6 and 4 1 detected , sir .
7 squadron's airborne , sir .
thank you .
let 12 group know .
and make sure they know ... they're protecting my airfields while they're up .
they have been told , sir .
tell them again .
pine tree leader , this is turkey control .
vector 1 9 2 .
i have some trade for you over maidstone .
turkey control , pine tree leader .
roger 1 9 0 .
pine tree , this is turkey .
twenty plus bandits and angels 2 0 heading west .
roger , turkey control .
indiana left .
making low level attack .
roger .
i see you .
i'm breaking left to attack .
my god !
fighters coming down now !
fire speed .
break .
break !
on your tail , jamie .
enemy aircraft approaching , sir .
coming straight for us .
flying course , 21st .
about eight thousand feet .
i'm taking cover .
tin hats , everybody .
that should damn well never have happened .
where the hell is 12 group?
they were requested , sir .
they're nowhere in sight .
find out what the devil they think they're playing at .
they just fell on us .
they got my number two and the c. o.
you saw canfield go down?
it blew up .
just blew up .
bad as we thought?
worse .
kenley and biggenor are shambles again ... and the rest are not much better .
god knows how many aircraft we'll have in the morning .
all because 12 group didn't do their stuff .
leigh mallory and his so called big wings .
might as well stay on the ground for all the use they are .
we were up , sir .
trying to knock out the enemy en masse .
but it takes time to assemble 40 or 50 aircraft at 15, 000 feet .
it takes far too long .
by the time your big wing is up ... the enemy have hit their targets and are on their way home .
all that matters is to shoot them down in large numbers .
i'd rather destroy fifty after they've hit their targets ... than ten before .
don't forget the targets are my airfields , leigh mallory ... and you're not getting fifty .
you're not even getting ten .
gentlemen , you're missing the essential truth .
we're short of two hundred pilots .
those we have are tired , strained ... and all overdue for relief .
we're fighting for survival .
losing .
we don't need a big wing or a small wing .
we need pilots .
and a miracle .
good night , gentlemen .
good night , sir .
good night , sir .
and now , over to the savoy hotel , london ... for dance music until midnight ... with carrol gibbons and his savoy hotel orpheans .
you look a damn sight better out of uniform .
hardly remember you out of yours .
and who's fault's that?
for god's sake , not again .
look , damn it , my squadron's come south .
you just apply for that posting !
colin , no !
all right , agreed !
taboo subject tonight .
old wafs .
you really think we're solemnly going ... to get into these ridiculous garments?
not at this stage , surely .
i'm shy .
oh , maggie , come on .
it's just ...
i am shy .
honestly .
i'll put out the light .
no , colin !
no , it's not just bed , it's us !
it's you .
and me .
you and me .
we should have been over target nine minutes ago .
the wind has veered .
so where are we?
where is london?
far back in the south west .
good .
then get rid of the bombs and let's go home .
colin .
i will put in for that posting .
promise .
that's their bombs !
they're bombing london !
it isn't funny !
cut it out !
too damn close .
colin , i promise .
i promise .
attacks on london are strictly forbidden .
this order you know as well as i do , major brandt .
these attacks may only be flown ... on the specific order of the fuehrer .
i regret , gentlemen ... that this is now completely out of my hands .
by order of vice marshal goering ... you two are to report to berlin to testify .
thank you .
major brandt?
flying officer froedl .
please follow me .
would you believe it?
don't they know there's a blackout?
if ever a bomb falls on berlin ...
" you may call me meier .
hmm .
you are to report to colonel schroeder at 9 a. m. sharp .
this car will take you to your quarters ... and you are to remain there .
as from today , we are called meier .
last night , bombs were dropped on berlin by the british .
so be it .
that is a game at which two can play .
if the r. a. f. drops three , four ... five thousand kilograms of bombs on germany in one night ... then in one night we shall drop three hundred ... four hundred , five hundred , five thousand on england !
when they attack our cities , we will flatten theirs .
then we will obliterate them !
the hour will come when one of us must crack .
it will never be national socialist germany !
never !
never !
the english are wondering .
they keep asking , " why doesn't he come?
be patient .
patience .
we are coming .
we are coming !
sieg heil !
sieg heil !
attention !
reichsmarschall , i welcome you in the name of ...
it's all right , kesselring .
thank you , thank you .
ah , osterkamp , everything all right?
yes , sir .
then it can begin .
come with me , kesselring .
yes .
don't stand around like a bunch of pigs !
fall in !
i'll let the lot of you swim over the channel !
attention !
in the ditch !
march !
get off the road !
attention !
there they come .
if we lose the war now ... they'll tear our arses asunder .
arrow to rabbit leader .
vector 1 6 0 .
bandits one hundred plus .
angels 1 5 .
bandits one hundred plus .
over .
rabbit to arrow .
i can't see them .
but they must be there .
well , come have a look for yourself then .
nothing , i repeat , nothing .
group , please .
everything we've got , and get them moving .
they've caught us this time .
they're turning northwest .
it looks like london .
it's london , all right ... and we've got everything up covering airfields .
where is the royal air force?
messerschmidt .
iron corps .
messerschmidt !
no , they ain't .
they're iron corps .
five seconds .
away !
away !
the pressure's dropping again .
this is as far as i can get , lad .
down at the end there , by that car .
hey , no you don't .
what do you mean?
there's a thousand pounder down there ... and it's not gone off .
if you're looking for somebody ... they're all down at the church hall .
they got the rose 'n 'crown .
he'll have to drink at the red lion now .
if they'll have him .
how bloody stupid can you get?
i spend half a leaf seeing you all safe in the country ... and you bring her back to all this .
i'm sorry , it's just we missed everyone .
you're all going back .
dad , have you finished it?
have you got it?
thank you .
there's a family trapped in shaw street .
can we have some more volunteers?
i'll be back , luv .
stop that bloody bell !
it came more from the back .
not real spitfires .
they couldn't land here .
you'll see in a minute .
only officers fly spitfires .
you're not a fighter pilot .
what about your top button?
anybody can do that .
t 5?
what's that?
they're a training squadron , sir .
the poles .
get them out of it .
get them down .
blackhawk leader , vector 2 3 0 ... and return to base immediately .
over .
blackhawk leader .
received and understood .
out .
blackhawk leader to " a " flight .
turn to port and steer 2 3 0 .
germans !
germans , on the right !
i don't see !
where?
down there on the right !
i see the jerries .
i see !
stop that polish chatter and steer 2 3 0 .
repeat , please .
i say again , 2 3 0 .
repeat , please .
for crying out loud , 2 3 0 !
repeat , please .
repeat , please .
now , just shut up , the lot of you , and follow me ... unless you're blind as well as ...
oh , god's truth .
shut up !
silence , in polish !
get out quickly !
one , the r. a. f. is not a flying circus .
two , strict r. t. procedure will be observed at all times .
and it is never ... repeat , never ... to be used ...
for private polish chitchat .
finally , and god alone knows why ...
i've received the following signal .
congratulations .
as of today , this squadron is operational .
signed , " keith park ...
air vice marshal , a. o. c. 11 group .
i was wrong about the poles .
we also have the second polish squadron , sir .
i thought you'd mention that .
all right .
make them operational .
and the canadians?
and the czechs .
we need them all .
looks like london again , sir .
yes .
and there's nothing we can do about it .
but if goering should concentrate ... on london by day ... it's another matter .
if it means he leaves my airfields alone ...
i shan't complain .
even a few days would give me the chance ... to get back to full strength .
he'll have farther to come .
and to go back .
we'll have more time to intercept .
what's more important , park ... his fighters have only fuel enough ... for ten minutes over london .
his bombers will lose much of their protection .
for the first time ... they'll all come within the range of 12 group .
perhaps now , at last , we shall see ... what leigh mallory's big wings are made of .
turning on london could be the germans 'biggest blunder .
spider leader , this is top hat control .
bandits now twenty miles east of you , heading southeast .
vector 1 2 0 .
make , angel 2 0 .
roger , top hat .
fox trot leader , this is tango control .
fox trot leader , pass your message .
i have some trade for you building up over green " a.
roger , tango .
spider leader , top hat control .
your customers appear to be splitting up .
main course heading for london will be your target .
vector 0 9 0 .
roger , top hat .
batman control .
climb to angels 1 9 .
roger , batman .
thank you again .
this should give them something to think about .
starlight control to dogtail .
keep an eye out for a friendly wing ... joining you on your port side .
roger , starlight .
i see them .
i see them .
bloody marvelous .
fox trot leader , tango control .
bandits now probably slightly below you .
roger , tango .
i've got them .
peewee leader turning starboard now .
watch out for 109s about .
roger , fairfield leader .
going up now .
take the left hand pair , blue leader .
roger .
everybody else , keep tight .
swarms of them , sir !
fox trot leader , cut that out .
everyone keep quiet .
leave the flaming fighters .
it's the bloody bombers we want .
ox , will you pipe down?
on fire , son of a gun !
ox !
behind you !
behind !
i am on fire !
i'm bailing out !
good afternoon .
good afternoon my ass , you boche bastard .
put your hands up !
come on , put them up !
what is it?
i'm a polish pilot ...
cor blimey .
your mitts , mate ... your mitts .
put 'em up there .
go on .
get going .
where are you taking me?
i'm fighting on your side !
can we get in?
and fetch the doctor .
good .
i know , young man .
get out of the way , man .
it's coming .
it's coming .
are you telling me that your losses are critical?
we're bombing day and night , reichsmarschall .
our losses are high , and our pilots are tired ... and the planes need servicing .
be specific !
what are you telling me? !
the english have changed tactics .
changed tactics?
how?
they are attacking in large numbers .
our losses might be reduced if our formations ... were more closely escorted by fighters , sir .
the fighters are always there .
but not close enough , is that it?
you , yourself , were a fighter pilot .
the fighter is a hunter , sir .
i was a fighter pilot .
i was not a coward !
there is no suggestion of cowardice , sir !
i am making the suggestion !
from now on the fighters will stay close with our bombers .
and lose their natural advantages ... of surprise and speed?
you will obey orders !
the invasion cannot begin until we have cleared the skies .
come , my friends , i have chastised you enough .
but i am here to help him .
is there anything you want?
foehn?
falke?
yes , sir , a squadron of spitfires .
stop ... vapor trail .
left and above .
vulture leader to everyone .
keep quiet .
hold positions .
we'll encircle them only when they close up ... to firing distance .
we'll take the rear starboard .
yellow , you take the port .
roger .
thanks awfully , old chap .
sir , you know ...
i have promised the fuehrer ... to clear the skies and totally destroy the r. a. f.
i expect to be obeyed !
here we are .
the miracle of the loaves .
we should have moved in here before we were bombed .
maggie , i'd like you to meet our new assistant controller .
squadron leader tom evans , section officer harvey .
how do you do?
hello .
he knows your old man .
how is colin?
haven't seen him since my little escapade ... with the burning hurricane .
excuse me , ma'am .
ma'am .
there's a call for you .
will you excuse me just a minute?
yes .
thanks .
it's around the corner .
hello?
it's me .
how on earth did you get through here?
put it down to rank .
i said i was an old battle ax from the air ministry .
colin .
that was very clever .
any news?
about?
your posting , you silly idiot .
well , you've applied .
i've been so busy here .
it's really not as simple as all that .
look , why the hell not?
to be absolutely honest , i forgot .
i know , darling .
i'm sorry .
groopy's here now .
i'll go and talk to him right away .
all right?
all right?
colin?
colin?
get through all right , sir?
yes .
let me give you a piece of advice .
what's that , sir?
stay single .
are you still with me , dogtail red 2?
affirmative , red leader .
directly behind you and on your starboard side .
what happened to harvey?
he got a 1 0 9 , then ran into trouble ... but he's all right .
no mistake .
i saw him bail out .
right , right , attention .
right .
stand at ease .
corporal seymour will detail you to your various watches .
i left out the bit about the wolf whistles .
you're better at that .
the troops have other things on their minds nowadays ... thank goodness .
right !
shun !
it's colin .
he isn't dead , maggie .
he's going to be all right .
they can do wonders nowadays , you know .
it's just a question of time , that's all .
we'll get you a posting so you can be near him .
is he badly burned?
you sent for me , sir?
yes , peter .
i want you to take over red section .
who are my numbers two and three , sir?
a couple of new lads .
they're outside .
right , then .
how many hours on spits?
ten , sir .
seven , sir .
stick to me like glue and keep your eyes open .
control .
put out 2 2 2 and 6 0 3 squadrons ... against hostile 2 6 .
winston would pick a day like this to come .
is everything up?
the lot , sir .
reserves?
none .
that's what i've just told the prime minister .
red 3 , this is red 1 .
much closer .
i can hardly see you .
red 2 .
you must keep up with me .
right , red section .
here we go .
stick to me like glue .
red 3 , behind you !
come in , blue 2 .
hey , kids .
shut up , will you?
this is the bbc home service .
here is the 9 : 00 news ... and this is armand adell reading it .
up till 8 : 00 tonight ... 165 german aircraft have been destroyed ... in big scale attacks attempted by the enemy today ... on london and the southeast .
we lost thirty fighters with ten of the pilots safe .
buckingham palace has been bombed again ... but no one was hurt .
yes?
yes , one moment .
it's the air minister , sir , on the scrambler .
yes?
dowding .
look , our people in washington ... are having trouble with the american press ... and it's about today's figures .
german sources there are saying ... that our claims are wildly exaggerated .
hello?
are you there , dowding?
i'm here , minister .
well , can you verify the figures?
i'm not very interested in propaganda .
if we're right , they'll give up .
if we're wrong , they'll be in london in a week .
morning , arnold .
morning , sir .
morning , sir .
morning , arnold .
morning , clyde .
dispersal .
right .
tea's up .
good morning , sir .
good morning .
they are late this morning , sir .
the bastards are up to something .
quick march !
you have let me down !
you have betrayed me !
