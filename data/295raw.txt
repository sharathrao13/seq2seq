good morning , mr. tong .
huh .
you put your face on without me , huh?
please have a seat .
those are the house rules .
memorize them .
especially number one .
never talk directly to mr. devlin .
if you have any questions you'll find all the answers in there .
and , if i were you , i'd get rid of the mildew on the chin .
my soul patch?
uh , yeah .
you like working for this devlin guy?
i don't work for him .
i'm not a professional driver , but i'd always believed that thing you're staring into is designed for the monitoring of traffic , not passengers .
am i wrong?
while i'm really enjoying our time together shall we try moving?
wallace has been my partner for years .
something's happened to him .
he wouldn'tjust disappear .
now , you get yourjob done and find my partner .
so tell me how .
you're the head of an intelligence agency .
why don't you be intelligent?
i don't understand what you're talking about .
well , why don't you call me back when you do understand what i'm talking about .
did we just take the balsam road exit?
of course .
you have to take the surface street .
sorry .
did you get a copy of the rules?
did you read them?
jimmy , let me tell you something , my friend ...
i hate the rules .
take grant boulevard all the way .
the lights are timed .
thank you .
and , jimmy ... crank the music up .
yes , sir .
c. s. a. headquarters
deputy director chalmers , ladies , gentlemen
i present to you special agent wallace .
deceased two days , 14 hours , five minutes ... approximately .
pretty interesting .
now , why don't you , uh , tell me a little about him?
well , in simplest terms , he drowned in his bathtub .
contusion here suggests he hit his head fell prone , unconscious .
the man infiltrated a serbian death squad with not even a scratch .
he goes down in a bathtub?
life's a bitch .
you want to put him back in the fridge?
wo he didn't drown , sir .
he was murdered .
does that make life a little less bitchy?
and and you would be?
that's del blaine , sir .
she's having a filter installed between her brain and mouth next week .
so you don't think he drowned?
well , sir , there was water in his lungs but the pulmonary vein was filled with collapsed platelets indicative of dehydration .
he died of thirst .
thirst .
and it wasn't just city tap water .
the mineral profile fit a high end bottled water but what was really weird is that it contained a strain of bacteria that i , so far haven't been able to culture .
anyway , uh ... didn't mean to interrupt .
ooh , the woman seems to know a lot about water .
yeah .
she thinks she knows a lot about a lot of things .
you know , we have a special situation in the field .
i think we could use your talents .
you interested?
when do i start?
you ever hear of clark devlin?
rumors and innuendo .
del , i could tell you a thing or two about clark devlin .
uh , you think we could keep our minds out of the gutter for about a second?
meet me upstairs in an hour .
you mightjust become
clark devlin's next partner .
i'm going to need that gerris marginalis as soon as possible .
wo yes .
my contacts in guatemala have what you're looking for , i'm sure .
good .
and , meanwhile ...
i'll take one of these beautiful uticella marginalis .
just gorgeous .
now , you're going to call me?
is your phone number on file?
i'm having a bit of trouble with the phones at the moment .
it might be better if you dropped it off yourself .
it may take a while .
well , why don't you familiarize yourself with the route?
there's a little gathering at my house tonight a fund raiser for the natural history museum .
i would so love to have you .
should i send a car?
i drive myself .
admirable .
eight o'clock .
and , uh , be sure not to wear anything too distracting , or no one will get their checkbooks out .
how did you learn to be so smooth?
i've seen the way you drive .
you have the same instincts i do .
you lack confidence .
the girl in the art gallery's not beyond you , you know .
you know about her?
every time we leave the house we go by the art gallery and slow down .
you just need a little polish .
i'll never be a clark devlin .
don't tell anyone this , jimmy , but there's a lot less to clark devlin than meets the eye .
i've got a couple of good lines and a couple of very expensive suits .
apart from that , we're exactly the same .
how about a couple hundred million?
trust me ... 90/ o of it is clothes .
the other ten percent?
the other ten percent's in there .
you've got plenty of it .
oh , mr. devlin , can i ask you a big favor?
yeah?
can i stop wearing my hat?
all right .
thank you .
no , just stay smooth .
remember smooth .
thank you .
steena , devlin .

bannlng , lnc . , floatlng headquarters
i'll tell you , i'm pretty excited .
i mean , nervous , but i'm excited .
i'm pumped , you know .
i knew i was doing good work for banning lnternational but i didn't know mr. banning would be taking so much notice of me so soon .
i'll say this , though , when i'm ceo of this place
i won't be having my headquarters in the bottom of a boat , you know what i mean?
why did you choose mr. lundeen?
he questioned my growth projections .
no , that's not it .
i don't like his hair .
mr. banning .
so , word filtered down to me that you don't share my optimism about our company's future .
oh , no .
actually , i just ...
drink?
oh , yes , thank you .
i just felt that to meet your projections , pretty much every person on earth would have to drink only banning springs water .
yes , indeed .
water , mr. lundeen , comprises 60/ o of your body .
don't you find it incredible that two hydrogen atoms and an oxygen atom can combine to create something so beautiful so useful , so essential?
i find water to be miraculous .
do you think i'm silly?
not at all .
feeling thirsty?
yes .
you're helping me out by being a guinea pig for a new product .
oh , i see .
what a brilliant idea .
water that makes you thirsty .
what's in it?
salt?
there's no profundity in salt .
bacteria .
once ingested its dna will instruct your cells 'cytoplasm to spill electrolytes into your bloodstream causing dehydration .
it's virulent but , unfortunately , it's too fast .
way too fast .
as we speak , your internal organs are shriveling .
you're becoming as dry as ...
well , as dry as your limited imagination .
gentlemen , fetch the vacuum , won't you?
thank you .
schiffer , schwartzkopf , sondheim , springsteen ...

clark devlin?
i'm del blaine .
have we met before?
no .
good .
okay , del blaine , let's do what we've come here to do .
i'll follow you .
ladies first .
okay .
a couple of details changed from what was in the file .
you read it?
the files are crap .
give me the short version .
deitrich banning's holding a meeting of international water company ceos .
we think he's trying to force them into selling their companies to him .
where are you going?
huh?
i'm thinking .
we had agent wallace working undercover at his bottled water factory .
that is , until last week .
wallace calls us on his cell phone to tell us that the operation had reached critical mass and , suddenly , wham !
dead .
as you requested , a klineholtz bolt action nine millimeter titanium folding stock with 20 time infrared sniper scope and counterweighted micro rifled barrel .
my favorite gun .
but i don't kill people anymore .
killing?
you're planting a bug .
it was all in that " crap " file .
go look through your binoculars .
they're arriving .
ready?
it's critical we get a listening device in banning's meeting .
range 962 feet .
aim for the briefcase .
should be a piece of cake for you , sir .
you kind of missed .
in the year 2001 $35 billion worth of bottled water was consumed worldwide .
today , bottled water costs more per gallon than gasoline .
we , my friends , are the new oil barons .
we at banning springs have developed a new filtration process that would protect your assets against the biological holocaust that's coming .
looks like we got company .
csa would be my bet .
you've heard what i have to say .
now i'd like to hear you .
how much is this plan going to cost us?
it won't cost you a penny , out of pocket .
all i ask is to become your slightly more than equal partner .
banning says he's got the only process to make their water safe .
but to use it , they've got to give him half of their companies?
he's trying to muscle these guys into selling their companies to him .
banning says that their water sources are in danger .
something about everyone being defenseless against more deadly forms of bacteria .
i can barely make out what he's saying .
do you want to listen to this?
what do you think that means , sir?
del blaine !
yeah , i'll be there in a minute .
yeah , i'd really like some help up here , sir .
del blaine !
do you hear me , sir?
i know this is not near as exciting as most of your missions , but could you humor me with just a little professionalism?
i would really love some help ...
what are you doing?
what's with the jumpy jumpy?
take off your headphones !
what?
your headphones !
okay , chapter six of the training manual .
unarmed assailant frontal attack .
begin !
stomach , head !

del ...
nice of you , moron .
not in the manual .
creep !
del blaine !
stop !
get off of me !
why didn't you stop?
god , what the hell is wrong with you? !
how do you ... fall off a building and end up ... uh ...
would you stop that?
it's okay .
i am in the car with a psychopath .
we are not safe .
are you upset?
why would i be upset?
i've always wanted to begin and end my career with a big fat failure !
thank you very much , mr. devlin .
it's my first time .
i mean ... every mission is like my first time .
it's so difficult being clark devlin .
oh .
sorry .
aah !
i didn't do that .
what ... i is wrong with you? !
i'm not who you think i am .
stay away !
i'm a little over amped myself right now .
let's just call it a day .
get some rest and medication .
what?
we'll be in communication .
oh .
i don't have your phone number !
c. s. a. target range
who am i kidding?
i have no idea what i'm doing or why i'm doing it .
i felt the same way when i took my first field assignment .
then i met clark devlin and life just got a whole lot better ... and a little more complicated .
let's , uh , can we get a close can we ...?
how do we pan down ...
yeah .
just hit the second button there .
everybody warned me , he was unorthodox but he's way irrational , bordering on nutso .
we'll just get , uh ...
that's it .
there , yeah .
that's it , there .
look at that .
move it over , over just a bit .
he's getting under your skin , isn't he?
he got under my skin once and i'm still feeling it .
yeah , you told me .
what about his english?
oh , i can never understand half of what he says but don't you just love his accent?
she can't hear anything from here ...?
no , i don't think ...
whoa !
god , i wish i was still back in the field .
how do you like me now?
she's got issues , man .
holy ...
can your , uh , can your girlfriend shoot , uh ...
a groin out of a target?
let's go .
let's get our nails done .
okay .

what do you mean?
after the fiasco of planting the bug
level one surveillance .
in other words ...
infiltration .
banning's going to be at the lanford hotel tonight entertaining three of his new partners .
chalmers has agreed to ... get us at the next table .

i can get her to talk .
and say what?
oh , emperor , would you sign my bra?
oops , i'm not wearing one .
what is it with you and bras?
she has information .
oh , right , and that's why you have to go up to her hotel room .

you don't care how you make people feel .
i happen to be an extremely sensitive person .
ow !
okay , you think you know feelings .
look at me .
how do i feel?
sick .
sad .
what about now?
constipated .
creepy .
horny .
is funny .
is angry .
is crazy .
you know nothing .
this is why you don't have a boyfriend .
no wonder you didn't get anything from banning .
oh ... right , i didn't get anything from banning except where his friggin 'lab is .
where?
let's see if the great master " agent " can figure it out .
banning said he sometimes has trouble sleeping .
big secret .
all men have trouble sleeping .
sometimes at night , he goes down and works in his lab .
he sleeps in his lab?
he sleeps in his bedroom .
his lab's in his bedroom?
no .
get your facts straight .
his lab is at his house his casa , where he lives get it?
excellent .
you passed the test .
i put in a good word with the boss .
well , let's go see chalmers tonight .
no .
keep him out of this .
just you and me .
you know , if you're so good at this why why don't you tell me something about me?
okay .
you have big crush on me and i know your name is del blaine .
first of all , you wish , and ... my real name is delilah .
delilah?
suits you .
hey ...
hmm?
ooh !
oh !
oh ... oh , emperor !
hey !
oh , god , clark , isn't anything sacred?
oh , rug burns are so sexy !
it's the driver .
oh , my god .
thank you .
invitations?
oh , yes .
why don't you offer him five bucks?
i have them somewhere .
birds of a feather ...
nice party , huh?
so , you're the strong , silent type , huh?
that's the whole bouncer package .
i didn't mean your package .
thank you ...
dr. schwartz .
shalom .
come , darling .
product launch , my ass .
let's go find banning's lab .
let's go .
are you trying to get me alone?
where'd they go?
don't tell me the great clark devlin can't come up with an answer .
although he can walk on water .
it's a trick , right?
come on .
wow !
mr. devlin likes insects , too .
what?
oh , uh , uh , i mean sometime i speak of myself in the third person .
hmm , del blaine thinks you're a freak .
have you cleaned the tanks?
what are they doing down there?
i don't know .
when you're done here you can go and sweep the tunnels .
don't use the blower !
i can tell the difference .
and don't touch the tequila for me and mr. banning .
whatever you say there , dr. simms .
yes , dr. simms .
louder !
yes , dr. simms .
we better hope the little ones follow the queen .
well , if they don't the stock is going to be worthless .
follow the queen "?
huh?
have you seen cheryl?
maybe he's gay .
cheryl?
no .
man , let's get out of here .
let's go have a smoke .
it still stinks .
hey .
how did you ...?
whatever .
look at this .
he's pinpointed the national reservoirs .
he's going to poison the water?
not with that stuff .
it's too detectable and there's government safeguards .
let's check out the computer .
now you're thinking .
who are they?
they shouldn't be in the lab .
let's go .
oh , my god .
oh , your god what?
dna recombinant microbes carrying a t 4 genome .
english .
genetically induced hydrogen oxygen barrier .
normal person's english .
dehydrating water .
drink it , you'll shrivel up and die but the big question is , how is he possibly going to introduce it into the water supply?
i think we better go .
huh?
go .
quick , over there by the wall .
nobody here .
let's check the hatchery .
you're on my foot .
what was that about?
shh !
go !
how did they miss us?
what , are they blind?
don't look up my skirt .
set adrift on memory bliss of you
the camera pans the cocktail glass
behind a blind of plastic plants
i found the lady with the fat diamond ring
then you know i can't remember a damn thing
i think it's one ...
banning's got the bacteria but he has to transport it from his lab to the water .
there's no way he can .
maybe with airplanes .
not possible .
besides , even if he could get it to a reservoir undetected an alarm would trigger the second the surface of the water's broken .
you're really smart .
it's an act .
i'm an inexperienced girl who's trying to bluff her way through .
you are?
come on , stop humoring me .
just be honest . ... assuming that there are some out there ...
honest?
all right .
you think i'm the great clark devlin .
... gonna say i look lovely ...
yeah , hello?
steena , i can't talk right now . ... i can't lie
she's just one of those corners in my mind
and i just put her right back ...
yeah .
yeah , i can handle it .
bad news?
can we go somewhere and be ... alone?
sure .
i didn't know you were so strong .
take off your clothes .
let's not do anything we'll regret .
take off your clothes .
what's happening?
look , i knew the second i met you you weren't clark devlin .
now take off the tuxedo .
it doesn't belong to you .
i wanted to tell you , but i just didn't know how .
take off your clothes .
what is that?
hey !
whoa !
you , out here !
okay .
take the clothes .
okay .
slow down .
my name is jimmy tong .
i'm mr. devlin's driver .
he asked me to find walter strider .
i don't want to hear any more of your lies .
now , give me the watch and the shoes .
now , where's clark devlin and how did you think you were going to get away with this?
things happened .
i decided to go with the flow .
what about the underwear?
they're mine .
i i mean , my roommate .
jimmy .
suits you .
these are my roommate's , too .
go finish your business .
have you seen the emperor?
no .
impolite to leave without saying good bye to the host .
i was just looking for deitrich .
i'll take you to him , then .
like a big terrier with a little rat .
i think she was down in the lab .
well , at least your interest in water was genuine .
look , i'm here because of you .
you wanted to know if i could be trusted?
i bet this tux is just your size .
thank you .
we got a positive location on blaine , sir .
how long till we get to her?
20 minutes .
i've transmitted the coordinates .
dear mr. devlin
i did the best i could , but it wasn't good enough .
i did not find walter strider for you .
i also lost your tuxedo .
i'm sure you will get it back .
i guess i will go back to being what i was before i met you .
oh !
water strider .
water strider .
water strider !
stupid !
my beautiful little darlings .
gerris maginatus .
species native to southeast asia .
commonly known as the water strider .
walter strider .
yes , the water strider .
very good .
very good .
well , it's brilliant .
they touch down on the reservoirs .
their little feet transfer a deadly bacteria without breaking the surface of the water so no alarms sound , and it looks like a nasty little trick of nature .
fortunately there is one drinkable water source .
yours .
deitrich , you're a genius .
too bad it won't work .
oh ... you so wrong .
wrong !
wrong !
wrong .
it will work because my plan is perfect .
sorry , mr. banning , it's your plan ... and mine .
um ... it's ours .
shut up .
explain .
oh , all righty .
the life cycle of the gerris maginatus begins with mating something dr. simms is not personally familiar with .
anyhoo , the insects swarm to freshwater where fertilized eggs are then deposited on the underside of lotus leaves and hatch into larvae .
spare me the discovery channel blather .
tell me why it won't work .
yes , tell us .
why it won't work?
this is the northern hemisphere , correct?
you incubated insects native to the southern hemisphere .
so , simply , it is too cold for them to mature sexually much like simms here .
therefore ... they won't mate .
therefore , they won't seek out water .
is this true?
no , i knew a girl once , in college , quite well .
very well .
and then you remember cousin doris?
no , simms , the bugs .
the bugs .
oh , you're not going to believe this hootchie are you , mr. banning?
oh , yeah?
ask him if i lied about the tuxedo .
this tuxedo is ... it's all right .
it's ...
all right "?
that is the most incredible piece of technology on the planet .
and i am laying it in your big , hot hands .
mr. banning , release the bugs .
go ahead .
do what he tells you .
you might have a chance at second prize at a junior high school science fair but you can forget your dreams of world domination .
slip into it , deitrich .
see how it feels .
the other ten percent's in there .
you've got plenty of it .
hey , dr. schwartz .
tell your boss clark devlin is back .
drapes nicely .
well , it certainly puts a spring in one's step .
happy to have lightened your loafers , deitrich .
one question .
why are you doing this?
hey , what the hell is this?
this is the moment where 50 csa commandos storm in take you , your pretentious accent your jackass sideburns to the federal pen where , guess what?
all they serve is highly chlorinated tap water .
presenting clark devlin .
have i told you how amazing you look in this tuxedo?
simms , prepare for release .
with pleasure , sir .
hatchery doors opening .
water sources targeted .
pods will begin releasing striders in five minutes .
85/ o .
why are you here?
i've come to save you .
that's great .
what about the big guys with the big guns?
for years , i've heard about you .
now we finally meet , i find that the great clark devlin is nothing more than an ordinary man who's about to die an extraordinary death .
you're right except for one thing .
my name's tong .
james tong .
you okay?
uh , jimmy , is there something you want to tell me?
later .
oh , you've got a good suit as well .
all right !
let go !
1 00/ o mature .
bacteria drop sites identified .
pods now opening .
what are you doing? !
no !
no !
she's ruining everything .
electrical malfunction .
hatchery door is disengaged .
ah , i knew girls like you in high school .
yeah?
did they do this?
uh huh , they did .
mr. banning , you must open the hatch manually .
sod off .
manual hatch release required .
manual hatch release required .
rotate valve counterclockwise to open hatch .
get off .
bloody open !
manual procedure complete .
hatchery doors opening .
airborne striders awaiting queen release .
hatchery doors opening .
clark !
i mean , jimmy , help me !
i'm busy .
all mature striders ready for release .
bacteria laced microbes fully activated .
his head's about to explode .
look at him .
look at him !
you might know a few tricks but you're just a sad , pathetic man .
smoking is bad for your health .
you okay?
yeah , duh .
by the way , nice going .
now millions of people are going to die of dehydration .
you left the hatch open .
they're not flying away .
yeah , what are they waiting for?
they are waiting ... to follow the queen .
airborne striders awaiting queen release .
oh , my god .
for once , you're right .
the queen is going to lead the striders to freshwater sites all over north america .
quick , grab it before it's released .
queen strider disengaged .
alert !
queen strider disengaged .
let's go .
he's got the queen !
wait !
you dropped it .
don't move !
oh !
ow .

ugh .
trouble .
okay , okay , make hustle , ladies .
let's go .
let's go .
watch out , aqua lung .
hey , pal , nice suit .
it's okay , kitten .
everything's going to be all right .
it is not okay .
you just decked the hero .
i i'm a genius and i can testify for a piece of immunity .
also , i'm from a neutral country ...
shut it .
well , looks like we got here just in time .
oh , to what?
take credit?
oh , you're hilarious , blaine .
winton chalmers , csa .
i spearheaded the operation that took down deitrich banning .
i bet you're jimmy tong .
here's your tuxedo .
you happy now?
well , i will be when i get it safely back to headquarters .
by the way , blaine , not a bad job for your first time in the field .
well , i didn't do it alone .
she always says nice things about me .
when you finally do something right , you deserve the credit .
well , sir it's an honor to help the united states of america .
i feel exactly the same way , soldier .
you don't think you're going to be able to get away with a bureaucratic pat on the butt , do you?
well , i'm hoping to .
ooh , man down , people .
well ... there is one thing you can do for me .
and that would be?
all right , tracking systems locked on .
anybody screws up and your ass is mine .
block off this end of the street .
roger that .
