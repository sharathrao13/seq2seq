do you find me sadistic?
you know , kiddo ... ... i'd like to believe ... ... you're aware enough , even now ... ... to know that there's nothing sadistic ... ... in my actions .
at this moment ... ... this is me ... ... at my most masochistic .
bill .
it's your ba ...
looked dead , didn't i?
well , i wasn't .
but it wasn't from lack of trying , i can tell you that .
actually , bill's last bullet put me in a coma a coma i was to lie in for four years .
when i woke up , i went on what the movie advertisements refer to as
a roaring rampage of revenge .
i roared , and i rampaged , and i got bloody satisfaction .
i've killed a hell of a lot of people to get to this point , but i've only one more .
the last one .
the one i'm driving to right now .
the only one left .
and when i arrive at my destination ,
i am gonna kill bill .
the incident that happened at the two pines wedding chapel that put this whole gory story into motion has since become legend .
massacre at two pines .
that's what the newspapers called it .
the local tvnews called it ,
the el paso , texas wedding chapel massacre .
how it happened , who was there , how many got killed and who killed them changes depending on who's telling the story .
in actual fact , the massacre didn't happen during a wedding at all .
it was a wedding rehearsal .
now , when we come to the part where i say ,
you may kiss the bride , " you may kiss the bride .
but don't stick your tongue in her mouth .
this might be funny to your friends , but it would be embarrassing to your parents .
we'll try to restrain ourselves , reverend .
y'all got a song?
how 'bout " love me tender "?
i can play that .
sure .
yeah .
love me tender " would be great .
rufus he's the man .
rufus , who was that that you used to play for?
rufus thomas .
rufus thomas .
rufus thomas .
i was a drell .
i was a drifter .
i was a coaster .
i was part of the gang .
i was a barkay .
if they come through texas , i done played with 'em .
rufus he's the man .
have i forgotten anything?
um ...
oh yes , you forgot , uh , the seating arrangements .
thank you , mother .
yes .
now , the way we normally do this we have the bride's side , and then we have the groom's side .
but since the bride ain't got nobody comin ', and the groom's got far too many people comin '...
well , yeah , they're comin 'all the way from oklahoma .
right ...
well , i don't see no problem with ... ... the groom's side sharing the bride's side .
do you , mother?
i don't have a problem with that .
but , uh ...
honey , you know , it would be good if you had somebody come .
you know , as a sign of good faith?
well , i don't have anybody ... ... except for tommy and my friends .
you have no family?
well , i'm workin 'on changing that .
mrs. harmony , we're all the family this little angel's ever gonna need .
i'm not feeling very well , and this bitch is starting to piss me off .
so while y'all blather on , i'm gonna go outside and get some air .
ok .
um , uh , reverend , sorry , uh ...
she's gonna go out and get some air .
yeah .
given her delicate condition ...
she just needs a few minutes to get it together .
she'll be ok .
right ...
hello , kiddo .
how did you find me?
i'm the man .
what are you doin 'here?
what am i doin '?
well ... ... moment ago i was playin 'my flute .
at this moment ... ... i'm lookin 'at the most beautiful bride these old eyes have ever seen .
why are you here?
last look .
are you gonna be nice?
i've never been nice in my whole life .
but i'll do my best to be sweet .
hmm .
i always told you ... ... your sweet side is you best side .
i guess that's why you're the only one who's ever seen it .
so you got a bun in the oven .
hmm .
i'm knocked up .
jeez , louise .
that young man of yours sure doesn't believe in wasting time , does he?
have you seen tommy?
big guy in the tux?
yes .
then i saw him .
i like his hair .
you promised you'd be nice .
no , i said i'd do my best .
that's hardly a promise .
but you're right .
what does your young man do for a living?
he owns a used record store here in el paso .
ah .
music lover , eh?
he's fond of music .
aren't we all?
and what are you doing for a j o b these days?
i work in the record store .
aso .
it all suddenly seems so clear .
do you like it?
yeah .
i like it a lot , smartass .
i get to listen to music all day ... ... talk about music all day .
it's really cool .
it's gonna be a great environment for my little girl to grow up in .
as opposed to jetting around the world , killing human beings , and being paid vast sums of money?
precisely .
well , my old friend ... ... to each his own .
however , all cockblockery aside ...
i am looking forward to meeting your young man .
i happen to be , more or less , particular whom my gal marries .
you want to come to the wedding?
only if i can sit on the bride's side .
you'll find it a bit lonely on my side .
your side always was a bit lonely .
but i wouldn't sit anywhere else .
you know ... ... i had the loveliest dream about you ...
oh , here's tommy !
call me arlene .
you must be tommy !
uh huh .
arlene's told me so much about you .
honey , you ok?
oh , i'm fine .
tommy , i'd like you to meet my father .
oh , my god !
oh , my god , this is great !
i'm so glad to meet you , sir ... uh , dad .
the name's bill .
well , it's great to meet you ...
bill .
arlene told me you couldn't make it .
surprise .
that's my pop for ya .
always full of surprises .
well , in the surprise department ... ... the apple doesn't fall far from the tree .
when did you get in?
just now .
did you come straight from australia?
of course .
daddy , i told tommy that you were in perth mining for silver , and ... ... no one could reach you .
lucky for us all , that's not the case .
so ...
what's this all about?
i've heard of wedding rehearsals , but i don't believe i've ever heard of a wedding dress rehearsal before .
we thought ,
why pay so much money for a dress you're only gonna wear once?
especially when arlene looks so goddamn beautiful in it .
so , i think we're gonna try to get all the mileage we can out of it .
isn't it supposed to be bad luck for the groom to see the bride in her wedding dress before the ceremony?
well , i guess i just believe in living dangerously .
i know just what you mean .
son .
some of us have places to be .
sure do .
look , we got to go through this one more time .
so , why don't you have a s ...
oh , my god .
what am i thinking?
you should give her away !
tommy , that's not exactly daddy's cup of tea .
i think father would be much more comfortable
sitting with the rest of the guests .
hmm .
really?
that's asking a lot .
oh .
ok .
well , forget it .
but how about we go out to dinner tonight to celebrate?
only on the condition that i pay for everything .
deal .
we got to do this now .
can i watch?
absolutely .
have a seat .
which is the bride's side?
right over here .
mother , here we go !
now son , about them vows ...
bill ...
i just want ...
you don't owe me a damn thing .
if he's the man you want ... ... then go stand by him .
do i look pretty?
oh , yes .
thank you .
what the hell?
no !
bill !
you tellin 'me she cut her way through 88 bodyguards before she got to o ren?
nah , there wasn't really 88 of 'em .
they just called themselves " the crazy 88
how come?
i don't know .
i guess they thought it sounded cool .
anyhow , they all fell under her hanzo sword .
she got a hanzo sword?
he made one for her .
didn't he swear a blood oath to never make another sword?
it would appear he has broken it .
them japs sure know how to hold a grudge , don't they?
or maybe ... ... you just tend to bring that out in people .
i know this is a ridiculous question before i ask it , but you haven't , by any chance , kept up with your ... swordplay?
i , um ...
i pawned that years ago .
you hocked a hattori hanzo sword?
yep .
it was priceless .
well , not in el paso , it ain't .
in el paso , i got me $250 for it .
i'm a bouncer in a titty bar , bill .
if she wants to fight with me , all she's got to do is come down to the club and start some shit , and we'll be in a fight .
i know we haven't spoken in some time , and the last time we spoke wasn't the most pleasant , but you've got to get over being mad at me , and start becoming afraid of , because she is coming , and she's coming to kill you .
and unless you accept my assistance , i have no doubt she will succeed .
i don't dodge guilt , and i don't jew out of paying my comeuppance .
can't we just ... forget the past?
that woman ... ... deserves her revenge .
and ... ... we deserve to die .
but then again ... ... so does she .
so i guess ... ... we'll just see .
won't we?
late again .
budd , can't you tell time?
there ain't nobody in here , man .
is that budd?
yeah .
tell him to get his fucking ass back here !
ok .
budd , larry'd like a word with ya .
take a hit .
be somebody , baby .
you looking for me?
i don't know what car wash you worked before you came here that let you stroll in 20 minutes late , but it wasn't owned by me
and i own a fuckin 'car wash .
do you want me to leave?
no , i don't want you to leave .
i want you to sit and wait .
larry ... ... there ain't nobody out there , so ...
there's nobody out there , larry .
what's your point?
that you're not needed here?
my point is ... ... i'm the bouncer , and there ain't nobody out there to bounce .
you saying that the reason ... ... that you're not doing the job that i'm ... ... paying you to do is that you don't have a job to do?
no ...
is that what you're saying?
what are you trying to convince me of , exactly?
that you're as useless as an asshole right here?
well , guess what , buddy?
i think ... you just fucking convinced me .
let's go to the calendar .
it's calendar time .
calendar time for buddy .
ok .

yeah .

till i call you .
before you leave , talk to rocket .
she's got a job for you to do .
and ... ... the hat .
that fuckin 'hat .
that fucking ...
how many times have i told you , don't wear that fucking hat here?
how many?
customers wear hats .
well , i'm not the boss of the customers .
i'm the boss of you .
and i'm telling you ... ... that i want you to keep that shit kicker hat at home .
yeah .
budd , honey , uh , the toilet is at it again .
there's shitty water all over the floor .
ok ...
rocket .
i'll clean it up .
mm hmm .
how many times
have you heard someone say ,
if i had his money ,
i could do things my way
but little they know
that it's so hard to find
one rich man in ten
with a satisfied mind
once i was wading
in fortune and fame
everything that i dreamed for
to get a start in life's game
then suddenly it happened
i lost every dime , but i'm richer ...
how many times
have you heard someone say ...
now ... ... that gentled you down some , didn't it?
yep .
ain't nobody a badass with a double dose of rock salt dug deep in her tits .
not havin '... tits ...

i can't even imagine how bad that shit must sting .
yet ...
... i don't want to , neither .
i win .
ugh !
ugh .
bill .
wrong brother , ya hateful bitch .
budd .
bingo .
and to what do i owe this dubious pleasure?
i just caught me the cowgirl ain't never been caught .
did you kill her?
well , not yet , i ain't .
i shot her full of rock salt .
she's so gentle right now , i could perform her coup de grce with a rock .
anywho ...
guess what i'm holdin 'in my hand right now?
what?
a brand spankin'new hattori hanzo sword .
and i'm here to tell ya , elle , ... that's what i call sharp .
how much?
oh , that's hard to say , bein 'that it's ... priceless and all .
what's the terms?
you get your bony ass down here first thing in the morning ... ... with a million dollars in folding cash ... ... and i'll give you the greatest sword ever made by a man .
now , how do you like the sound of that?
sounds like we got a deal .
one condition .
what?
she must suffer to her last breath .
well ...
that , elle darlin '... ... i can pretty much damn well guarantee .
then i'll see you in the mornin ', millionaire .
all right .
wakey , wakey .
eggs and bakey .
i'm done !
get me outta this hole !
good .
whew .
whoa , look at those eyes .
this bitch is furious .
what did i tell ya?
is she the cutest little blond pussy you ever saw?
or ... is she the cutest little blond pussy you ever saw?
i seen better .
you got anything to say?
white women call this " the silent treatment .
and we let 'em think we don't like it .
you grab the feet , i'll get the head .
hey .
hey .
hey !
wiggle worm , you see this?
you see it , don't ya?
that's a can of mace .
mm hmm .
no .
you're goin 'underneath the ground tonight .
and ... that's all there is to it .
i wanna bury ya .
i was gonna bury ya ...
... with this .
but if you're gonna act like a horse's ass ... ... i'm gonna spray this whole goddamn can right in your eyeballs !
i'll burn 'em right outta your fuckin 'head .
then you're gonna be blind ... ... and burnin '... ... and buried alive .
now , what's it gonna be , sister?
that's a wise decision .
this is for breakin 'my brother's heart .
once upon a time ... ... in china ... ... some believe around the year ... ... one double aught three , head priest of the white lotus clan , pai mei , was walking down a road ... ... contemplating whatever it is that a man of pai mei's infinite powers would contemplate which is another way of saying , " who knows? " when a shaolin monk appeared on the road , traveling in the opposite direction .
as the monk and the priest crossed paths ... ... pai mei ... ... in a practically unfathomable display of generosity , gave the monk the slightest of nods .
the nod ... ... was not returned .
now , was it the intention of the shaolin monk to insult pai mei?
or did he just fail to see the generous social gesture?
the motives of the monk remain unknown .
what is known ... ... were the consequences .
the next morning , pai mei appeared at the shaolin temple ... ... and demanded of the temple's head abbot that he offer pai mei his neck to repay the insult .
the abbot , at first , tried to console pai mei .
only to find pai mei was ... ... inconsolable .
so began ... ... the massacre of the shaolin temple , and all sixty of the monks inside , at the fists of the white lotus .
and ... so began the legend ... ... of pai mei's five point palm exploding heart technique .
and what , pray tell , is the five point palm
exploding heart technique?
quite simply , the deadliest blow in all of martial arts .
he hits you with his fingertips ... ... at five different pressure points on your body ... ... and then lets you walk away .
but once you've taken five steps ... ... your heart explodes inside your body ... ... and you fall to the floor , dead .
did he teach you that?
no .
he teaches no one the five point palm exploding heart technique .
now ... ... one of the things i've always liked about you ... ... kiddo ... ... is you appear wise beyond your years .
whatever ... ... whatever pai mei says , obey .
if you flash him , even for an instant , a defiant eye , he'll pluck it out .
and if you throw any american sass his way ... ... he'll snap your back and your neck like they were twigs .
and that will be the story of you .
he'll accept you as his student .
what happened to you?
nothin '.
get in a fight?
friendly contest .
why did he accept me?
because he's a very , very , very old man .
and like all rotten bastards ... ... when they become old , they get lonely .
which has no effect on their dispositions , but it does teach them the value of company .
whew .
oh .
just seein 'those steps again makes me ache .
you're gonna have a lot of fun carrying buckets of water up and down that fucker .
when will i see you again?
that's the title of my favorite soul song of the seventies .
what?
nothin '.
when he tells me you're done .
when do you think that might be?
that , my dearest , depends entirely on you .
now remember , no sarcasm , no backtalk .
at least not for the first year or so .
you're gonna have to let him warm up to you .
he hates caucasians , despises americans , and has nothing but contempt for women .
so in your case ... it might take a little while .
adis .
master ...
your mandarin is lousy .
it causes my ears discomfort .
you bray like an ass !
you are not to speak unless spoken to .
is it too much to hope ... you understand cantonese?
i speak japanese very well ...
i didn't ask if you speak japanese ...
i asked if you understand cantonese?
a little .
you are here to learn the mysteries of kung fu , not linguistics .
if you can't understand me ...
i will communicate with you like i would a dog .
when i yell , when i point , when i beat you with my stick !
bill is your master , is he not?
yes , he is .
your master tells me ... you're not entirely unschooled .
what training do you possess?
i am proficient in tiger crane style , and i am more than proficient in the exquisite art of the samurai sword .
the exquisite art of the samurai sword .
don't make me laugh !
your so called exquisite art , is only fit for ...
japanese fat heads !
your anger amuses me .
do you believe you are my match?
no .
are you aware i kill at will?
yes .
is it your wish to die?
no .
then you must be stupid ...
then you must be stupid ... so stupid .
rise , and let me look at your ridiculous face .
rise .
so my pathetic friend ...
is there anything that you can do well?
what's the matter?
cat got your tongue?
oh yes , you speak japanese .
i despise the goddamn japs !
go to that rack .
remove the sword .
let's see how good you really are .
lf ... ... you land a single blow ,
i'll bow down and call you master .
from here you can get an excellent view of my foot .
your swordsmanship ... is amateur at best .
your so called kung fu ... is really ... quite pathetic .
i asked you to demonstrate ... what you know ... and you did ...
not a goddamn thing !
let's see your tiger crane ... match my eagle's claw .
like all yankee women ... ... all you can do is order in restaurants and spend a man's money .
excruciating ... isn't it?
yes !
if it was my wish ... ... i could chop your arm off .
no , please don't !
it's my arm now .
i can do what i please .
if you can stop me ...
i suggest you try .
i can't .
because you're helpless?
yes .
have you ever felt this before?
no .
compared to me ... you're as helpless as a worm fighting an eagle?
yes !
that's the beglnnlng !
is it your wish to possess this kind of power?
yes !
your training will begin ... tomorrow .
since your arm now belongs to me ... ... i want it strong .
can you do that?
i can , but not that close .
then you can't do it .
what if your enemy ... is three inches in front of you ... ... what do you do then ... ... curl into a ball ... ... or do you put your flst through him?
now begin .
it's the wood that should fear your hand ...
not the other way around .
no wonder you can't do it ... you acquiesce to defeat ...
before you even begin .
if you want to eat like a dog ...
you can live and sleep outside like a dog .
if you want to live and sleep like a human ... ... pick up those sticks .
come on , you bitch .
ok , pai mei .
here i come .
may i have a glass of water , please?
