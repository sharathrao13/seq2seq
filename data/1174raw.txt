hey , can i get another drink down here?
i've been to prison once .
i've been married twice .
i was once drafted by lyndon johnson and had to live in shit ass mexico for two and a half years for no reason .
i've had my eye socket punched in , a kidney taken out , and i got a bone chip in my ankle that's never gonna heal .
i've seen some pretty shitty situations in my life .
but nothing has ever sucked more ass than this .
if i'd known i was gonna have to put up with screaming brats pissing on my lap for 30 days out of the year ,
i would have killed myself a long time ago .
come to think of it , i still might .
where i come from , we didn't celebrate christmas .
not because we were jewish , but because my dad was a worthless coward fucking asshole whose idea of a present was a daily punch to the back of the head .
he did teach me how to crack a safe , though .
my dad never did shit with his life , so he took it out on me .
you could say i'm no different .
i'd have to say you were right .
but at this point , it's too late to start over .
funny how things work out .
it's fucking hilarious .
there's santa claus .
look there .
wow .
oh , my .
what a darling photo .
are you certain you only want the single?
additional photos come in handy as gifts for grandma and grandpa or as a wonderful remembrance for friends .
gee .
you know what?
this one , i think it's more than enough .
thanks .
merry christmas .
so , what do you want , little girl?
a drum set .
oh , the old man will love that .
okay .
fine .
see you later .
i saw you at another mall .
well , i'm very happy for you .
you're not really santa .
if you were santa , you could do magic .
you want to see some magic?
here .
let's watch you disappear .
watch the bladder , kid .
santa's got to pee .
what do you want?
a new bike .
wow .
that's a new one .
excellent .
attention , shoppers .
the store will be closing in five minutes .
we hope tomorrow is a pleasant christmas .
thank you for shopping with us .
is that it?
yeah , that's the last one .

i was against the clinton impeachment .
what a man does with his own penis
oval office , women's big & tall it's not for the american people to say .

of course , i can't fire him for that .
oh , yeah .
unfair practices .
special pleading .

the guy's roger merman .

give it to me .
ow !
damn it !
what's wrong with you , woman?
who are you?
your name roger merman?
yes .
but ...
you doing three to six for embezzlement?
uh , well , many accounting questions are not cut and dried .
do you live at 41 sage terrace?
is it grandma?
is my son all right?
they're fine .
do you have any houseguests?
houseguests?
thank you for your time .
god bless .
well , hey , who are you?
houseguests?
little trick i learned up at the north pole .
if you fry baloney , it tastes like a hot dog .
i thought you didn't like sandwiches .
yeah , but this is not a sandwich .
a sandwich has two pieces of bread with a bunch of junk on it .
it's like a tostada .
this isn't a tostada .
there you go , granny .
little salsa here .
now it's a tostada .
have you seen my advent calendar?
what the fuck is it with the advent calendar?
why are you so obsessed with that goddamn thing?
the story sucks anyway .
i think i saw it in the hallway .
really?
i think so .
looks like someone messed with my advent calendar .
what are you talking about?
let me see .
nobody messed with it .
it looks fine .
there's a candy corn in this one .
well , they can't all be winners , can they?
well , it's fucked .
yeah?
yeah .
fucked , frankly .
he's ...
clean ...
oh .
as a fucking whistle .
nothing?
no .
oh .
nothing .
i mean shit .
yeah .
he curses .
yeah?
but never around children .
oh .
no criminal record .
yeah .
no parking tickets .
nothing .
no bad habits , even .
oh .
sex , yeah .
but man is a sexual being .
yeah .
fuckin 'darwinian .
oh .
you can't do shit about that .
no .
hell , i wouldn't want to .
no , of course not .
i'm not advocating celibacy .
hope not .
it'd be the end of the fucking human race .
yeah .
fucks large women .
what can i say?
hey , look , it's the retard again .
wedgie .
yeah .
yeah .
well , what the hell do you want?
pokmon !
done .
you probably shouldn't be digging in your ass .
santa ...
oh , jeez .
is that your underwear?
part of it .
where the hell's the rest of it?
no , actually , don't tell me .
what do you want?
i was thinking i wanted a purple stuffed elephant , not pink .
but now i changed my mind .
yeah , what?
now i don't want an elephant .
i want a gorilla named davey for beating up the skateboard kids who pull on my underwear .
he could take his orders from the talking walnut , so it wouldn't be my bad thing .
jesus , kid .
when i was your age , i didn't need no gorilla , and i wasn't as big as one of your legs .
four kids beat me up and i went crying to my daddy .
you know what he did?
he made it all better?
no , he kicked my ass .
you know why?
'cause you went to the bathroom on mommy's dishes?
what the fuck?
no .
he tried to teach you not to cry and be a man?
no .
it's because he was a mean , drunk son of a bitch .
when he wasn't busting my ass , he was putting cigarettes out on my neck .
the world ain't fair .
you gotta take what you need when you can get it .
learn to stand up for yourself .
quit being a pussy .
kick these kids in the balls or something .
or don't .
shit , i don't care .
just leave me out of it .
now , get on out of here .
okay .
thanks , santa .
go get the next lucky boy or girl , okay?
all right , next .
open the ropes there , marcus .
i know you?
not yet .
seven cities in seven years .
pretty impressive .
the store changes , your name changes .
but you always get away clean .
yeah .
pretty darn impressive .
well , let's face the facts .
y'all are a couple of half bucket small timers .
you , because of your physical attributes , found a niche , and i respect that .
but you also been caught ... ... by me .
so this is how it's gonna be .
i don't want to take over .
i don't even want to change your scam .
whatever you guys do , it works .
all i want is a taste .
when the deed is done , we part ways .
i'll buy a little ranch in havasu , and you all take your little medicine show back on the road .
how much?
half .
no way !
you don't know who you're fucking with .
back off , will .
i got this .

40 % .
half .
42 % .
half .
45 % .
half .
48 %?
half .
49 % .
half .
well , what's one point?
we split the dough right down the middle .
any merchandise you take , i get to look at and cherry pick .
no !
money's one thing , but you ain't gettin 'the
this ain't no chinese menu , jagoff .
i tell you how it's gonna be .
this is pricks fix .
pricks fix?
he's a fucking moron .
oh , really?
is that how you got the upper hand?
fuck you .
negotiating?
if you don't like , next year , fuck off .
i can always get another box jockey .
i can get another midget , too .
yeah , where?
you see us hanging off of trees like fucking crab apples?
even if we did , you'd never front your own racket .
you know why , willie?
you got no discipline .
you got zero fuckin 'initiative .
you'd fall apart without me .
you're too pathetic for words .
you're a fucking loser , and you fucking know it .
santa'll be here real soon , kids .
real soon .
there he is .
look .
oh , no .
oh , my god !

hey , hey , hey .
hey , hey .
hey , come on , come on .
look , hey !

i'll smooth things over with chipeska .

in case you hadn't noticed , i'm a motherfuckin 'dwarf .
so unless you got a forklift handy , maybe you should lend a hand , hmm?

you want all kind of set asides .
special treatment 'cause you're handicapped .

you got some lip on you , midget .
well , these lips were on your wife's pussy last night .
why don't you dust that thing off once in a while?
asshole .
i pissed my pants .
oh , shut up .
santa .
santa?

what are you doing?
nothing .
you going to work today?
not really .
you just gonna sit there?
yeah .
just let me alone , okay?
hey , wait a minute .
hey , kid?
yeah?
i want you to take this letter .
when the paramedics come to bag santa up , there's gonna be some cops there .
i want you to make sure that those cops get that envelope .
what is it?
it just tells all the bad things that ...
what the fuck happened to your eye?
fucking little prick !
so you like to give little kids black eyes , huh?
how 'bout you , huh? !
you want some? !
anybody else?
anybody else?
come on !
yeah , there you go .
you know , i think i've turned a corner .
yeah?
you fucking petites now?
no .
i'm not talking about that .
i beat the shit out of some kids today .
but it was for a purpose .
it made me feel good about myself .
it was like i did something constructive with my life .
i don't know .
like i accomplished something .
you need many years of therapy .
many , many , many fuckin 'years of therapy .
okay .
you don't drink , which is smart on your part .
but being sober can put you at a disadvantage when it comes to violence .
i can't box worth a shit , see .
but i'm good in a fight because i can't feel anything .
you , you're gonna feel everything .
okay .
now put your dukes up .
let me see what you got .
this is bullshit !
give me one good reason why i should even consider doing this .
'cause i let 2, 000 kids spit in my face for your ass .
that's why .
now , i'm asking you for this one thing .
come on , look at the kid .
he is pathetic .
yeah , he's just a little ...
he's a fucking retard .
yeah , let's show him a couple of things so he can defend himself , then .
unless you're scared .
all right , here's what's gonna happen .
marcus is a bully , right?
he's gonna pull your underwear up out of your pants .
now , what do you do?
i don't know .
god damn it !
you don't know?
if somebody wants to pull your underwear up out of your pants , you have to get mad .
yeah , kid , come on .

yeah?
so i thought i'd give you your present now .
what the fuck is it?
it's a wooden pickle .
why'd you paint it brown?
it's not paint .
it's blood from when i cut my hand making it for you .
oh .

i ...
thanks .
you're welcome .
good night , santa .
good night , mrs. santa's sister .

thurman merman?
yeah .
jesus .
so , you think i did good?
what do you care what i think , anyway?
hell , i guess you did better than i did .
i never got any b's .
i thought maybe at least since i did good in school , maybe you'd bring me a present .
'cause last year and the year before that , you didn't bring me any presents .
even though i'm a dipshit loser .
jesus fucking christ , kid !
why do you talk about yourself that way? !
let me give you some news .
i'm not santa claus , all right?
take a look at me .
do i look like santa claus?
as a matter of fact , i'm living fucking proof that there's not a santa claus .
i know there's no santa .
i just thought maybe you'd want to give me a present
'cause we're friends .
there he is .
that lousy , leather faced , frog eyed , motherfucker .
good night , gin .
good night .
jesus , mother mary , and joseph .
what is the problem now?
i'm sorry .
the van stalled .

i can't reach it .
jesus christ , give me that .
thanks .
all right , hit it .
oh , my .
what a terrible accident .
mm mm mmm .
is he dead?
no .
but it looks like you broke most of his ribs .
i'd say maybe 50 % of them , or do you think 30 %?
i needed more of a running start .
i couldn't build up enough speed .
merry christmas eve .
got you a little something .
you shouldn't have .
you should put that stuff in the kitchen .
god damn , you look good .

andy pitzorella?
yeah .
no , andy ripitski .
andy pitzorella was andy blue balls .
since he got married , they call him andy pitzorella .
what's your fucking point? !
they say he can get into anything .
anything .
they say he's been in margaret thatcher's pussy .
and that's a good thing?
so what the fuck are you getting at?
when i was in the joint with him , he told me that the kitnerboy redoubt can't be cracked .
are you shittin 'me?
are you telling me that after i propped you up , held you together , smiled for all those kids , danced for all those fucking housewives in a fucking lime green , fucking velvet elf costume , that you cannot get in this fucking safe? !
is that what you're telling me? !
huh? !
no , i'm just saying it's gonna take a minute .
fuck .
shit .
34c .
fuck !
piece of cake .
i gotta get one more thing .
i'll be right back .
oh , shit .
which one did he say?
i'll bet the store dick don't want this .
store dick don't want shit .
what do you mean?
store dick's dead .
store dick don't want shit .
he's dead , huh?
i didn't even know he was sick .
willie ... this has been a long time coming .
every year , you're worse .
every year , less reliable .
more booze .
more bullshit .
more buttfucking .
sure , the three b's .
you gotta be able to rely , willie .
you people are monsters .
there's no joy in this for me .
i'm not talking about you taking me out .
that part , i get .
but look at all that shit .
do you really need all that shit?
for christ sakes , it's christmas .
it is christmas , willie .
but this is what we do .
we get the shit .
christmastime , we get the shit .
because we are men and lois .
it is christmas , willie .
and we are men and lois .
what you waiting for , honey?
come on , plug him .
goodbye , willie .
drop the gun .
huh? !
and you , santa , drop the elephant .
where did you come from?
tipped off .
shit , that fucking kid .
all three of you are in so much shit , it's almost unbelievable .
marcus , hop on !
fuck me .
hey , hey !
this is christmas , and the kid's getting his fucking present .
halt , police !
put your hands up !
i said freeze !
freeze !
aaaah !
aaaah !
dear kid ...
i hope that you got my present and that there wasn't too much blood on it , although there was blood on the present you gave me , which didn't keep me from enjoying it .
so maybe the blood doesn't matter so much , i guess .
anyway , just in case they took it as evidence ,
i'm also sending you a t shirt .
i hope it's the right size .
i'm healing up good , and they tell me that i will soon be 100 % , even with 8 bullets dug out of me , because they didn't hit any vital organs , just my liver , which is fucked anyway .
ha ha ha .
thank you for giving that letter to the cops .
i forgot i asked you to do it , but it's a good thing you did or santa's little helper would've plugged his ass .
now the cops know i wrote it , which is gonna keep my ass out of jail .
that , plus everyone agreeing that the phoenix police shooting an unarmed santa was even more fucked up than rodney king .
the cops are treating me like fucking royalty now , which is new in my experience .
they're gonna make me a sensitivity counselor so that tragedies like this will never again embarrass the whole fucking department .
i told the cops you had no one to take the fuck care of you , so they set it up with mrs. santa's sister watching you till your dad gets back in one year and three months .
they made her a guardian pro tem or some such shit .
anyway , she seems to like you and your house and jacuzzi .
i sent her some money , so if you play your cards right , you can probably get her to buy you something .
as for my little helper , i'm sorry to have to tell you that him and his prune faced , mail order wife are gonna be exploring mountains with your dad .
i hope your dad doesn't go sucking shit from them
like i did .
they're supposed to let me out of this hospital room soon , so get some sandwiches ready .
until then , don't take no shit from nobody ,
least of all yourself .
ho ho ho .
your pal , santa .
hey , loser .
i hear your buddy's not here to protect you anymore .
see you got me a new bike .
thanks a lot .
i'm talking to you , fat ass !
aaah !
