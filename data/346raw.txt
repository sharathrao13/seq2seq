quiet , missy , cursed pirates sail these waters .
you dont want to bring them down on us now , do ya?
mr. gibbs that will do !
she was singing about pirates .
bad luck to be singing about pirates with us mired in this unnatural fog .
mark my words .
consider them marked .
on your way .
aye , lieutenant .
its bad luck to have a woman on board , too , even a miniature one .
i think itd be rather exciting to meet a pirate .
think again , miss swann .
vile and dissolute creatures , the lot of them .
i intend to see to that any man who sails under a pirate flag or ... ... wears a pirate brand gets what he deserves .
a short drop and a sudden stop .
lieutenant norrington , i appreciate your fervor .
but im im concerned about the effect this subject will have upon my daughter .
my apologies , governor swann .
actually , i find it all fascinating .
yes , thats what concerns me .
look , a boy !
theres a boy in the water !
man overboard !
haul him aboard !
hes still breathing .
mary , mother of god !
what happened here?
its most likely the powder magazine .
merchant vessels run heavily armed .
a lot of good it did them .
everyones thinking it .
im just saying it ...
piratas !
theres no proof of that .
it was probably an accident .
rouse the captain immediately ! .
hay , sir .
heave to and take in sail , launch the boats .
elizabeth i want you to accompany the boy .
hell be in your charge .
take care of him .
its ok .
my names elizabeth swann .
will turner .
im watching over you , will .
youre a pirate !
has he said anything?
his name is william turner , thats all i found out .
take him below .
elizabeth !
are you alright?
are you decent?
yes , yes !
still abed at this hour?
its a beautiful day .
i have a gift for you .
oh , its beautiful !
isnt it? .
may i inquire as to the occasion? .
does a father need an occasion to dote upon his daughter?
go on .
actually , i , uh ...
i had hoped you might wear it for the ceremony today .
the ceremony?
captain norringtons promotion ceremony .
i knew it !
commodore norrington hes about to become .
fine gentleman , dont you think .
he fancies you?
elizabeth?
hows it coming?
its difficult to say .
im told its the latest fashion in london .
well , women in london mustve learned not to breathe .
my lord , you have a visitor .
ah , mr. turner , good to see you again .
good day , sir .
i have your order .
the blade is folded steel , thats gold filigree laid into the handle .
if i may?
perfectly balanced .
the tang is nearly the full width of the blade .
impressive , very impressive .
ah , now , commodore norrington is going to be very pleased with this .
do pass my compliments on to your master .
i shall .
a craftsman is always pleased to hear his work is appreciated .
ah , elizabeth , you look absolutely stunning .
will .
so good to see you !
i had a dream about you last night .
about me?
elizabeth , is that entirely proper for you to ...?
about the day we met , do you remember?
how could i forget , miss swann?
will , how many times must i ask you to call me elizabeth?
at least once more , miss swann , as always .
there , see .
at least the boy has a sense of propriety .
now , we really must be going .
farewell .
good day , mr. turner .
come along .
good day ... ... elizabeth .
what?
hold up there , you .
its a shilling to tie up your boat at the dock .
and i shall need to know your name .
what dye say to three shillings and we forget the name?
welcome to port royal , mr. smith .
two paces front !
right about turn !
present ... ... arms !
this dock is off limits to civilians .
im terribly sorry , i didnt know .
if i see one ... ... i shall inform you immediately .
apparently theres some sort of a high toned and fancy to do up at the fort , eh?
how could it be that two upstanding gentlemen such as yourselves did not merit an invitation?
someone has to make sure this dock stays off limits to civilians .
its a fine goal to be sure but it seems to me that a ... a ship like that makes this one here a bit superfluous , really .
ah , the dauntless is the power in these waters , true enough , but theres no ship ... ... that can match the interceptor for speed .
ive heard of one , supposed to be very fast , nigh un catchable ...
the black pearl
well theres no real ship that can match the interceptor .
the black pearl is a real ship .
no , no its not .
yes , it is , ive seen it .
youve seen it?
yes .
you havent seen it .
yes , i have .
youve seen a ship with black sails ... ... thats crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil ... ... that hell itself spat him back?
ne .
ne .
but i have seen a ship with black sails .
oh , and no ship thats not crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil ... ... that hell itself spat him back out could possibly ... ... have black sails therefore couldnt possibly be any other ... ... ship than the black pearl .
is that what you're saying?
ne .
like i said theres no real ship that can match the interceptor
hey !
you !
get away from there !
you dont have permission to be aboard there , mate .
im sorry , its just its such a pretty boat ship !
whats your name?
smith or ... smithy , if you like .
whats your purpose in port royal , mr. smith?
yeah , and no lies !
well , then , i confess , it is my intention to commandeer one of these ships .
pick up a crew in tortuga , raid , pillage , plunder and otherwise pilfer my weasely black guts out .
i said no lies .
i think hes telling the truth .
if he were telling the truth , he wouldnt have told us .
unless , of course , he knew you wouldnt believe the truth even if he told it to you .
may i have a moment?
you look lovely , elizabeth .
yes?
i apologize if i seem forward but i ... must speak my mind
this promotion throws into sharp relief that which i have ... ... not yet achieved .
a marriage to a fine woman .
you have become a fine woman , elizabeth .
i cant breathe .
yes , im a bit nervous myself .
... and then they made me their chief .
elizabeth?
elizabeth !
the rocks !
sir , its a miracle she missed them !
will you be saving her then?
i cant swim .
pearl of the kings navy you are .
do not lose these .
what was that?
i got her .
not breathing .
move !
never would have thought of that .
clearly youve never been to singapore .
where did you get that?
on your feet .
elizabeth .
are you alright?
yes , im fine .
shoot him !
father !
commodore , do you really intend to kill my rescuer?
i believe thanks are in order .
had a brush with the east india trading company , did we?
pirate?
hang him .
keep your guns on him , men .
gillette , fetch some irons .
well , well ...
jack sparrow , isnt it?
captain jack sparrow , if you please , sir .
well , i dont see your ship ... captain .
im in the market as it were .
he said hed come to commandeer one .
told ya he was telling the truth .
these are his , sir .
no additional shots nor powder ...
a compass that doesnt point north ...
and i half expected it to be made of wood .
you are , without doubt , the worst pirate ive ever heard of .
but you have heard of me .
commodore , i really must protest .
carefully lieutenant .
pirate or not this man saved my life .
one good deed is not enough to redeem a man of a lifetime of wickedness .
though it seems enough to condemn him .
indeed .
finally .
no , dont shoot !
i knew youd warm up to me .
commodore norrington , my effects , please ... ... and my hat .
commodore !
elizabeth , it is elizabeth isnt it?
its miss swann .
miss swann , if youd be so kind .
come , come , dear , we dont have all day .
now if youd be very kind ..
easy on the goods , darling .
youre despicable .
sticks and stones , love .
i saved your life , you saved mine , were square .
gentlemen , mlady . you will always remember this as the day that you almost caught ... ... capitan jack sparrow .
now , will you shoot him?
open fire !
on his heels !
gillette , mr. sparrow has a dawn appointment with the gallows ... ... i would hate for him to miss it .
right where i left you .
not where i left you .
you're the one they're hunting .
the pirate .
ah .
well , then it would be a shame to put a black mark on your record .
so , if you'll excuse me ...
do you think this wise , boy ... ... crossing blades with a pirate?
you threatened miss swann .
only a little .
you know what youre doing , ill give you that .
excellent form ... ... but hows your footwork?
if i step here ...
very good .
now i step again .
ta .
that is a wonderful trick .
except once again you are between me and my way out .
and now you have no weapon .
who makes all these?
i do !
and i practice with them ... ... three hours a day !
you need to find yourself a girl , mate .
or , perhaps the reason you practice three hours a day is that you already found one ... ... and are otherwise incapable of wooing said strumpet .
you're not a eunuch , are you?
i practice three hours a day , so that when i meet a pirate ... ... i can kill it .
you cheated .
pirate .
move away .
no .
please , move .
no !
i cannot just step aside and let you escape .
this shot is not meant for you .
move in !
excellent work , mr. brown .
youve assisted in the capture of a dangerous fugitive .
just doing my civic duty , sir .
well , i trust youll always remember this as the day that captain ... ... jack sparrow almost escaped .
take him away !
can you smell it .
nice juicy bone .
come here , boy .
you can keep doing that forever , the dog is never going to move .
oh , excuse us if we haven't resigned ourselves to the gallows just yet .
has my daughter given you an answer yet?
no , she hasnt .
well , she has had a very trying day .
ghastly weather , dont you think?
bleak , very bleak .
whats that?
cannon fire !
return fire !
i know those guns .
its the pearl .
black pearl?
ive heard stories .
shes been preying on ships and settlements for near ten years .
never leaves any survivors .
no survivors?
then where do the stories come from , i wonder?
goveror .
barricade yourself in my office .
thats an order !
don`t ...
hello , chump .
girl .
smiss swann , theyve come to kidnap you .
what?
youre the governors daughter .
they havent seen you .
hide and the first chance you get , run to the fort .
gotcha !
its hot !
its on me !
come on .
we know youre here , poppet .
poppet .
come out .
we promise we wont hurt you .
we will find you , poppet .
youve got something of ours and it calls to us .
the gold calls to us ...
gold , gold .
hello , poppet .
parley what?
parley .
i invoke the right of parley .
according to the code of the brethren , set down by the pirates morgan and bartholomew ... ... you have to take me to your captain .
i know the code .
if an adversary demands parley you can do them no harm until ... ... the parley is complete .
to blazes with the code .
she wants to be taken to the captain .
and shell go without a fuss .
we must honor the code .
say goodbye !
goodbye .
come on !
elizabeth .
outta my way , scum !
my sympathies friend , youve no manner of luck at all .
come on , doggy .
its just you and me now .
its you and ol jack .
come on .
come on .
good boy .
thats it .
good boy , come on .
bit closer , bit closer .
thats it , thats it , doggy .
come on you filthy , slimy , mangy cad .
no , no , no , no , no , i didnt mean it .
i didnt .
this aint the armory .
well , well , well , look what we have here twigg?
capitain jack sparrow .
last time i saw you , you were all alone on a godforsaken island .
shrinking into the distance .
his fortunes arent improved much .
worry about your own fortunes , gentlemen .
the deepest circle of hell is reserved for betrayers and mutineers .
so there is a curse .
that's interestin .
you know nothing of hell .
thats very interesting .
i didnt know we were takin on captives .
shes invoked the right of parley with captain barbossa .
i am here to negotiate ...
you will speak when spoken to .
and yell not lay a hand on those under the protection of parley .
aye , sir .
my apologies , miss .
captain barbossa , i am here to negotiate the cessation of hostilities i ... ... against port royal .
there are a lot of long words in there , miss , were naught but humble pirates .
what is it that you want?
i want you to leave and never come back .
im disinclined to acquiesce to your request ... ... means no .
very well .
i'll drop it .
me holds are burstin 'with swag and that bit of shine matters to us?
why?
its what youve been searching for .
i recognized the ship .
i saw it eight years ago on the crossing from england .
did ya now?
fine .
well , i suppose if it is worthless then theres no point in me keeping it .
you have a name , missy?
elizabeth ...
turner
im a maid in the governors household .
miss turner .
bootstrap .
and how does a maid come to own a trinket such as that?
family heirloom , perhaps?
i didnt steal it if thats what you mean .
very well , you hand it over and well put your town to our rudder and never return .
our bargain?
still the guns and stowem , ... the men .
wait !
you have to take me to shore .
according to the code of the order of the brethren ...
first , your return to shore was not part of our negotiations ... ... nor our agreement so i must do nothing .
and secondly , you must be a pirate for the pirates code to apply and youre not
and thirdly , the code is more what you'd call " guidelines " than actual rules .
welcome aboard the black pearl , miss turner .
theyve taken her .
theyve taken elizabeth .
mr. murtogg , remove this man .
we have to hunt them down , we must save her .
and where do you propose we start?
if you have any information concerning my daughter , please , share it .
that jack sparrow .
he talked about the black pearl .
mentioned it , is more what he did .
ask him where it is .
make a deal with him he could lead us to it .
no ... the pirates who invaded this fort left sparrow locked in his cell ergo .... ... they are not his allies .
governor , we will establish their most likely course ...
thats not good enough !
mr. turner , you are not a military man , you are not a sailor .
you are a blacksmith and this is not the moment for rash actions .
do not make the mistake of thinking you are the only man here ... ... who cares for elizabeth .
you !
sparrow .
aye .
you are familiar with that ship , the black pearl?
ive heard of it .
where does it make berth?
where does it make berth?
have you not heard the stories?
captain barbossa and his crew of miscreants sailed from the dreaded isla de muerta .
its an island that cannot be found except by those who already know where it is .
the ships real enough .
therefore its anchorage must be a real place .
where is it?
why ask me?
because youre a pirate .
and you want to turn pirate yourself , is that it?
never .
they took miss swann .
oh , so it is that youve found a girl .
i see .
well , if youre intending to brave all , hasten to her rescue and so win fair ladys heart ... ... youll have to do it alone , mate .
i see no profit in it for me .
i can get you out of here .
hows that?
the keys run off .
i helped build these cells .
these are half pin barrel hinges .
with the right leverage and a proper application of strength ... ... the door will lift free .
whats your name?
will turner .
that will be short for william , i imagine .
good , strong name .
no doubt , named for your father , aye .
yes .
aha .
well , mr. turner , ive changed me mind .
if you spring me from this cell , i swear on pain of death ... ... i shall take you to the black pearl and your bonny lass?
do we have an accord?
agreed .
agreed , get me out .
hurry , someone will have heard that .
not without my effects .
were going to steal a ship?
that ship?
commandeer .
were going to commandeer that ship .
nautical term .
one question about your business boy , or theres no use going .
this girl , how far are you willing to go to save her?
id die for her .
oh , good .
no worries , then .
this is either madness or brilliance .
its remarkable how often those two traits coincide .
everyone stay calm , we are taking over the ship .
aye , avast !
this ship cannot be crewed by two men .
you'll never make it out of the bay .
son .
im captain jack sparrow , savvy?
commodore !
sir , theyve taken the dauntless !
theyve taken the ship .
sparrow and turner , they've taken the dauntless !
rash , turner , too rash .
he is without doubt the worst pirate i have ever seen .
here they come .
bring her around !
bring her around !
search every cabin , every hold , down to the bilges .
sailors , back to the interceptor !
now !
thank you , commodore , for getting us ready to make way .
wed have a hard time of it by ourselves .
set top sails and clear up this mess .
with the wind a quarter astern , we wont catch them .
we dont need to catch them just get them in range of the long nines .
men , come about .
run out the guns .
we open fire on our own ship , sir?
id rather see her at the bottom of the ocean than in the hands of a pirate .
commodore , hes disabled the rudder chain , sir .
abandon ship !
thats got to be the best pirate ive ever seen .
so it would seem .
when i was a lad living in england , my mother raised me by herself .
after she died , i came out here , looking for my father .
is that so?
my father , will turner .
and in jail it was only after you learned my name that you agreed to help .
since thats what i wanted , i didnt press the matter .
im not a simpleton , jack .
you knew my father .
i knew im .
probably one the few who knew him as william turner .
everyone else just called him bootstrap or bootstrap bill .
bootstrap?
good man , good pirate .
i swear you look just like him .
its not true .
he was a merchant sailor , a good , respectable man who obeyed the law .
he was a bloody pirate , a scallywag .
my father was not a pirate .
put it away , son .
its not worth you getting beat again .
you didnt beat me .
you ignored the rules of engagement .
in a fair fight .
id killed you .
and thats no incentive for me to fight fair , is it?
now as long as youre just hanging there , pay attention .
what a man can do and what a man cant do .
for instance you can accept that your father was a pirate and a good man ... ... or you cant .
but pirate is in your blood , boy , so youll have to square with that someday .
and me , for example , i can let you drown .
but i cant bring this ship into tortuga all by me onesies , savvy?
so ...
can you sail under the command of a pirate ... ... or can you not?
tortuga?
tortuga .
... feel unwanted .
not sure i deserved that .
giselle !
who was she?
what?
i may have deserved that .
curse you for breathing , you slack jawed idiot !
mothers love !
jack !
you should know better then to wake a man when hes sleeping .
is bad luck ah , fortunately i know how to counter it .
the man who did the waking buys , the man who was sleeping , a drink .
the man who was sleeping drinks it while listening to a proposition ... ... from the man who did the waking .
aye , that'll about do it .
blast !
im already awake !
that was for the smell .
keep a sharp eye !
now , whats the nature of this venture you are in?
im going after the black pearl .
i know where its going to be and im going to take it .
jack , its a fools errand .
well , you know better than me the tales of the black pearl?
thats why i know what barbossa is up to ... ... all i need is a crew .
from what i hear tell of captain barbossa , hes not a man to suffer fools nor strike a bargain with one .
well , then i say its a very good thing im not a fool then , aye .
prove me wrong .
what makes ye think brabossa will give up his ship to you?
let s just say it s a matter of leverage , aye?
the kid?
that is the child of bootstrap bill turner .
his only child , savvy?
is he now?
leverage says you ... ... i think i feel a change in the wind says i. i il find us a crew ... ... there s bound to be some sailors on this rock crazy as you .
one can only hope .
take what you can ...
give nothing back
you'll be dinin 'with the captain .
and he requests you wear this .
well , you may tell the captain that i am disinclined to acquiesce to his request .
he said you d say that .
he also said if that be the case ... ... you'll be dinin 'with the crew ... ... and you'll be naked
fine .
there s no need to stand on ceremony , nor call to impress anyone .
you must be hungry .
try the wine .
and the apples .
one of those next .
it s poisoned .
there would be no sense to be killing you miss turner .
then release me , you have your trinket .
i m of no further value to you .
you don t know what this is , do you?
it s a pirate medallion .
this is aztec gold .
one of 882 identical pieces they delivered in a stone chest to corts himself .
blood money paid to stem the slaughter he wreaked upon them with his armies .
but the greed of corts was insatiable .
so the heathen gods placed upon the gold a terrible curse .
any mortal that removes but a piece from that stone chest ... ... shall be punished for eternity .
i hardly believe in ghost stories anymore , captain barbossa .
aye .
that s exactly what i thought when we were first told the tale .
buried on an island that cannot be found except ... ... for those who know where it is .
find it , we did .
there be the chest ... ... inside be the gold .
we took them all !
spent them and traded them .
we frittered them away ... on drink and food and pleasurable company .
the more we gave them away , the more we came to realize ... ... the drink would not satisfy , food turned to ash in our mouths ... ... and all the pleasurable company in the world could not slake our lust .
we are cursed men , miss turner .
compelled by greed we were , and now we are consumed by it .
there is one way we can end our curse .
all the scattered pieces of the aztec gold must be restored ... ... and the blood repaid .
thanks to you we have the final piece .
and the blood to be repaid?
that s why there s no sense to be killing you ...
yet !
apple?
i m curious , after killing me what was it you planning on doing next?
look !
the moonlight shows us for what we really are .
we are not among the living and so we cannot die .
but neither are we dead .
for too long i ve been parched with thirst and unable to quench it .
too long i ve been starving to death and haven t died .
i feel nothing , not the wind on my face nor the spray of the sea .
nor the warmth of a woman s flesh .
you best start believing in ghost stories miss turner ...
you re in one !
what are ye looking at?
back to work !
feast your eyes , captain .
all of them , faithful hands before the mast .
every man worth his salt .
and crazy to boot .
so this is your able bodied crew?
you , sailor !
cotton , sir .
mr. cotton !
do you have the courage and fortitude to follow orders and stay true in the face of danger and almost certain death?
mr. cotton !
answer me !
he's a mute , sir .
poor devil had his tongue cut out , so he trained the parrot to talk for him .
no one s yet figured how .
mr. cotton's parrot !
same question .
wind in the sails !
wind in the sails !
mostly , we figure , that means " yes " .
o course it does .
satisfied?
well , you ve proved them mad .
and what s the benefit for us?
ana maria .
i suppose you didn t deserve that one either?
no , that one i deserved .
you stole my boat !
actually ...
borrowed , borrowed without permission .
but with every intention of bringing it back to you .
but you didn t !
you il get another one i will .
a better one a better one !
that one !
what one?
aye !
that one .
what say you !
aye !
no , no , no , no , no , it s frightful bad luck to bring a woman aboard , sir .
it d be far worse not to , have her .
how can we sail to an island that nobody can find ...
with a compass that doesn't work?
aye , the compass doesn't point north ... ... but we're not trying to find north , are we? .
we should drop canvas , sir .
she can hold a bit longer .
what s in your head that s put you in such a fine mood , captain?
we re catching up .
time to go , poppet !
dead men tell no tales .
puts a chill in the bones how many honest sailors have been claimed by this passage .
how is it that jack came by that compass?
not a lot known about jack sparrow before he showed up in tortuga ... ... with a mind to go after the treasure of the isla de muerta .
that was before i met him .
back when he was captain of the black pearl .
what?
he failed to mention that .
well , he plays things close to the vest now .
and a hard learned lesson it was .
see three days out on the venture the irst mate comes to him and says ... ... everything s an equal share as should be the location of the treasure too .
so , jack gives up the bearings .
that night there was a mutiny .
they marooned jack on an island and left him to die .
but not before he d gone mad with the heat .
ah .
so that's the reason for the ...
reason's got nothing to do with it .
now will , when a pirate is marooned he is a given a pistol with a single shot .
well it won't do much good hunting or to be rescued .
but after three weeks of starving belly and thirst that pistol ... ... starts to look real friendly .
but jack escaped the island and he still has that one shot .
oh , but he won't use it though , save for one man .
his mutinous first mate .
barbossa .
aye .
how did jack get off the island?
well , i il tell you .
he waded out into the shallows and there he waited three days and three nights ... ... till all manner of sea creature came and acclimated to his presence ...
and on the fourth morning ...
he roped himself a couple of sea turtles , harnessed them together and made a raft !
he roped a couple of sea turtles?
aye , sea turtles .
what did he use for rope?
human hair ... ... from my back .
let go of the anchor !
let go of the anchor , sir .
young mr. turner and i are to go ashore .
captain !
what if the worst should happen?
keep to the code .
aye , the code .
ten years of hoarding swag .
and now we re finally getting to spend it .
once we re quit of the curse we il be rich men .
and you can buy an eye that actually fits and is made of glass .
this one does splinter something terrible .
stop rubbing it .
what code is gibbs to keep to if the worst should happen?
pirate s code .
any man that falls behind is left behind .
no heroes amongst thieves , eh .
you know for having such a bleak outlook on pirates you re well on your way to becoming one .
sprung a man from jail , commandeered a ship of the fleet ... ... sailed with a buccaneer crew out of tortuga .
and you re completely obsessed with treasure .
that s not true .
i m not obsessed with treasure .
not all treasure is silver and gold , mate .
gentlemen , the time has come !
aye !
salvation is nigh !
aye !
our torment is near at end !
elizabeth?
for ten years we ve been tested and tried and each man , jack you here ... has proved his mettle a hundred timesover !
and a hundred times again !
aye !
suffered i have .
punished we were .
the lot of us disproportionate to our crime !
here it is !
the cursed treasure of corts himself .
every last piece that went astray we have returned ... ... save for this .
jack .
not yet .
we wait for the opportune moment .
when s that?
when it s of greatest profit to you?
may i ask you something?
have i ever given you reason not to trust me?
do us a favor , i know it s difficult for you but please stay here .
and try not to do anything stupid .
and who among us has paid the blood sacrifice owed to the heathen gods?
us !
and whose blood must yet to be paid?
hers !
you know the first thing i m goin to do after the curse is lifted ... ... eat a whole bushel of apples .
begun by blood , by blood undone .
sorry , jack , i m not going to be your leverage .
that s it?
waste not .
did it work?
i don t feel no different?
how do we tell .
you re not dead
no .
he shot me .
it didn t work .
the curse it still upon us .
yes !
you , maid !
your father , what was his name?
was your father william turner?
no .
where s his child?
the child that sailed from england eight years ago?
the child in whose veins flows the blood of william turner?
where?
you two !
you brought us the wrong person !
aye !
no !
she had the medallion ... ... she s the proper age .
she said her name was turner , you heard her
you brought us here for nothing !
i won t take questions and no second guesses , not from the likes of you , master twigg?
who s to blame?
every decision you ve made has led us from bad to worse .
it was you who sent bootstrap to the depths !
aye !
and it s you who brought us here in the first place !
aye !
any coward here dare challenge me , let him speak !
i say , we cut her throat and spill all her blood .
just in case .
yeah !
the medallion !
she s taken it !
well , after her !
you pack of ingrates !
the oars have gone missing .
find them !
you .
you re supposed to be dead !
am i not?
parley !
that s the one .
parley !
parley .
damned to the depths whatever man had thought of parley?
that would be the french .
not more pirates !
welcome aboard , miss elizabeth .
mr. gibbs?
hey , boy !
where be jack?
jack?
jack sparrow?
he fell behind .
keep to the code !
raise anchor !
hoist the sails !
make quickly .
how the blazes did you get off that island?
when you marooned me on that godforsaken spit of land , you forgot one very important thing mate ...
i m captain jack sparrow .
ah , well , i won't be making that mistake again .
gents , you all remember captain jack sparrow?
yeah !
kill him !
the girl s blood didn t work , did it?
hold your fire !
you know whose blood we need?
i know whose blood ye need .
what sort of a man trades a man s life for a ship?
pirate .
here , let me .
thank you .
you said you gave barbossa my name as yours .
why?
i don t know .
i m sorry .
blacksmith s hands , i know they re rough .
no ... i mean yes , they are but ...
... but don t stop .
elizabeth .
it s yours .
i thought i d lost it the day they rescued me .
it was a gift from my father , he sent it to me .
why did you take it?
because i was afraid that you were a pirate .
that would ve been awful .
it wasn t your blood they needed ...
it was my father s blood ...
my blood .
the blood of a pirate .
i m so sorry , please forgive me .
so you expect to leave me standing on some beach with nothing but a name and your word ... ... it s the one i need and watch you sail away on my ship?
no .
i expect to leave you standing on some beach with absolutely no name ... ... at all , watching me sail away on my ship and then i il shout the name back to you .
savvy?
but that still leaves us with the problem of me standing on some beach with naught ... but a name and your word it's the one i need .
of the two of us i am the only one who hasn't committed mutiny .
therefore my word is the one we'll be trusting .
although , i suppose i should be thanking you because in fact ... ... if you hadn t betrayed me and left me to die ... ... i would have an equal share in that curse same as you .
funny old world , innit?
captain , we re coming up on the interceptor .
i m having a thought here , barbossa .
what say we run up a flag of truce?
i scurry over to the interceptor ... ... and i negotiate the return of your medallion , aye?
what say you to that?
now you see , jack , that s exactly the attitude that lost you the pearl .
now you see , jack , that s exactly the attitude that lost you the pearl .
people are easy to search when they re dead .
lock him in the brig !
what s happening?
the black pearl , she s gaining on us .
this is the fastest ship in the caribbean .
you can tell them that after they ve caught us .
we re shallow on the draft , right?
well , then can't we lose them amongst those shoals?
we don t have to outrun them long , just long enough .
lighten the ship .
stem to stern !
anything that we can afford to lose ... see that it s lost !
apparently there s a leak .
haul on the main brace .
make ready the guns .
and run out the sweeps .
we re gonna need that .
it was a good plan up till now .
gibbs !
we have to make a stand .
we must fight !
load the guns !
with what?
anything .
everything !
anything we have left .
load the guns !
nails and crushed glass !
with a will .
the pearl is going to lap up on our port quarter .
she il rake us without ever presenting a target !
lower the anchor on the right side .
on the starboard side !
it certainly has the element of surprise .
you re daft , lady !
you both are .
daft like jack .
lower the starboard anchor !
do it ye dogs or it s you we il load into the cannons !
let go !
hard aport .
rack the starboard oars !
keep us steady now !
fire !
fire !
stop blowing holes in my ship !
we could use a few more ideas , lass !
your turn !
we need us a devil s dowry .
we il give them her .
she s not what they re after .
the medallion .
hands !
grapples , at the ready .
prepare to board ! !
... to the powder magazine !
and the rest of you bring me the medallion !
hey !
hey !
below !
thanks very much .
jack !
bloody empty .
that s not very nice .
where's the medallion?
wretch !
ah , where s dear william?
will .
i can t move it !
why thank you , jack .
you re welcome .
not you .
we named the monkey jack .
gents , our hope is restored !
yeah !
if any of you as much as thinks the word parley , i il have your guts for garters .
stop it !
welcome back , miss .
you took advantage of our hospitality last time .
it holds fair now that you return the favor .
barbossa !
she goes free !
what s in your head , boy !
she goes free !
you ve only got one shot and we can t die .
don t do anything stupid .
you can t ... i can .
who are you?
no one .
he s no one .
a distant cousin of my aunt s nephew twice removed .
lovely singing voice , though .
eunuch .
my name is will turner .
my father was bootstrap bill turner .
his blood runs in my veins .
he's a spitting image of ol 'bootstrap bill come back to haunt us .
on my word do as i say or i il pull this trigger .
and be lost forever to davy jones locker .
name your terms , mr. turner .
elizabeth goes free .
yes , we know that one .
anything else?
and the crew , the crew are not to be harmed .
agreed .
barbossa , you lying bastard !
you swore she d go free .
don t dare impugn me honor , boy .
i agreed she d go free it was you who failed ... ... to specify when or where .
though it does seem a shame to lose something so fine , don t it lads?
so i il be having that dress back before you go?
i always liked you .
it goes with your black heart .
ooh , it s still warm .
off you go !
come on !
too long !
i really had rather hoped we were past all this .
jack , jack .
did ya not notice?
that be the same little island that we made you governor .
of on our last little trip .
i did notice .
perhaps you il be able to conjure up another miraculous escape .
but i doubt it .
off you go .
last time you left me a pistol with one shot .
by the powers , you re right .
were be jack s pistol?
bring it forward .
seeing as there s two of us , a gentleman would give us a pair of pistols .
it il be one pistol as before and you can be the gentleman ... ... and shoot the lady and starve to death yourself .
that s the second time i ve had to watch that man sail away with my ship .
but you were marooned on this island before , weren t you?
so we can escape in the same way you did then
to what point and purpose , young missy?
the black pearl is gone .
and unless you have a rudder and a lot of sails hidden in that bodice ...
unlikely , young mr. turner will be dead long before you can reach him .
but you re captain jack sparrow .
you vanished from under the eyes of 7 agents of the east india company .
you sacked nassau port without even firing a shot .
are you the pirate i ve read about or not?
how did you escape last time?
last time ... i was here a grand total of three days , alright?
last time ... ... the rumrunners used this island as a cache .
came by and i was able to barter a passage off .
from the looks of things , they ve long been out of business .
probably have your bloody friend norrington to thank for that .
so that s it then?
that s the secret grand adventure of the infamous jack sparrow?
you spent three days lying on a beach , drinking rum !
welcome to the caribbean , love .
we're devils and black sheep and really bad eggs .
drink up me 'earties yo ho !
yo ho yo ho a pirate's life for me !
i love this song !
really bad eggs !
when i get the pearl back , i m gonna teach it to the whole crew .
and we'll sing it all the time .
and you il be positively the most fearsome pirate in the spanish main .
not just the spanish main , love .
the entire ocean ... the entire world .
wherever we want to go , we'll go .
that s what a ship is , you know?
it s not just a keel and a hull and a deck and sails that's what a ship needs ...
but what a ship is ...
what the black pearl really is ... ... is freedom .
jack ...
it must be really terrible for you to be trapped on this island .
oh , yes .
but the company is infinitely better than last time , i think .
and the scenery has definitely improved ...
mr. sparrow , i m not entirely sure ... ... that i ve had enough rum to allow that kind of talk .
i know exactly what you mean , love .
to freedom !
to the black pearl .
no !
not good !
stop !
not good !
what are you doing?
you burned all the food , the shade , the rum !
yes , the rum is gone .
why is the rum gone?
one , because it is a vile drink that turns even the most respectable men into complete scoundrels .
two , that signal is over a thousand feet high .
the entire royal navy is out looking for me .
two , that signal is over a thousand feet high .
the entire royal navy is out looking for me .
do you really think that there is even the slightest chance that they won t see it?
but why is the rum gone?
just wait , captain sparrow .
you give it one hour , maybe two , keep a weather eye out and then you will see ... ... white sails on that horizon .
must ve been terrible for you to be trapped here , jack .
must ve been terrible for you ...
well it bloody is now !
there il be no living with her after this .
but we ve got to save will !
no !
you re safe now .
we will return to port royal immediately not go gallivanting after pirates .
then we condemn him to death .
the boy s fate is regrettable .
but then so is his decision to engage in piracy .
to rescue me , to prevent anything from happening to me !
if i may be so bold as to interject my professional opinion .
the pearl was listing near to scabbers after the battle .
it s very unlikely she il be able to make good time .
think about it .
the black pearl .
the last real pirate threat in the caribbean , mate .
how can you pass that up?
by remembering that i serve others , mr. sparrow , not only myself .
commodore , i beg you , please do this .
for me as a wedding gift .
elizabeth .
are you accepting the commodore s proposal?
i am .
a wedding !
i love weddings , drinks all around !
i know .
clap him in irons , right
mr. sparrow .
you will accompany these fine men to the helm and provide us ... ... with the bearing to isla de muerta .
you will then spend the rest of the voyage contemplating all possible meanings of the phrase ...
silent as the grave " .
do i make myself clear?
inescapably clear .
shiver me timbers .
cotton ere says you missed a bit .
you knew william turner?
old bootstrap bill ... we knew him .
never sat well with bootstrap what we did to jack sparrow .
the mutiny and all .
he said it wasn t right with the code .
that s why he sent off a piece of the treasure to you as it were .
he said we deserved to be cursed ... ... and remain cursed .
stupid blighter good man .
but as you can imagine ...
that didn t sit too well with the captain .
that didn t sit too well with the captain , at all .
tell him what barbossa did .
i m telling the story !
so ...
what the captain did ...
he strapped a cannon to bootstraps bootstraps .
the last we saw of old bill turner ...
he was sinking to the crushing black oblivion of davy jones locker .
course it was only after that ...
we learned we needed his blood to lift the curse .
that s what you call ironic .
bring him !
i don t care for the situation .
any attempt to storm the cave could turn to an ambush .
not if you re the one doing the ambushing .
i go in to convince barbossa to send his men out in their little boats .
you and your mates return to the dauntless and blast the bejesus outta them with your little cannons , aye?
what do you have to lose?
nothing i d lament being rid of .
now , to be quite honest with you ...
there s still a slight risk for those aboard the dauntless which includes the future mrs. commodore .
sorry , but for your own safety .
i don't care what the commodore ordered , i must tell him .
the pirates they cannot be killed !
don t worry , miss , he s already informed of that .
a little mermaid flopped up on deck and told him the whole story .
this is jack sparrow s doing .
no reason to fret , it s just a prick of the finger and a few drops of blood .
no mistakes this time .
he s only half turner .
we spill it all .
guess there is reason to fret .
beg your pardon .
begun by blood ...
excuse me .
by blood un ...
jack .
it s not possible .
not probable .
where s elizabeth?
she s safe , just like i promised .
she's all set to marry norrington , just like she promised .
and you get to die for her , just like you promised
so we're all men of our word really .
except for elizabeth who is , in fact , a woman .
shut up !
you re next !
you don t want to be doing that , mate .
no , i really think i do .
your funeral .
why don t i want to be doing it?
well , because ...
because the hms dauntless , pride of the royal navy ...
is floating just offshore ...
waiting for you .
what are we doing here?
pirates come out ... unprepared and unawares .
we catch them in the crossfire ...
send them down to see old hobb .
i know why we re here .
i mean ...
why aren t we doing what it was what mr. sparrow said we should do ...
with the cannons and all .
because it was mr. sparrow who said it .
you think he wasn t telling the truth?
just hear me out , mate .
you order your men to row out to the dauntless , they do what they do best .
robert s your uncle fannie s your aunt , there you are with two ships .
the makings of your very own fleet . course you il take the grandest as your flagship and who s to argue?
but what of the pearl?
name me captain .
i'll sail under your colors , i il give you ten percent of me plunder and you get to introduce yourself as ... ... commodore barbossa .
savvy?
i supose in exchange you want me not to kill the whelp .
no , no , not at all by all means , kill the whelp .
just not yet ...
wait to lift the curse ...
until the opportune moment .
for instance ...
after you ve killed norrington s men ... every ... last ... one .
you ve been planning this from the beginning .
ever since you learned my name .
yeah .
i want fifty percent of your plunder .
15 % 40 %
25 %
and i il buy you the hat ...
a really big one ...
commodore .
we have an accord !
all hand s to the boats !
apologies , you give the orders .
gents ...
take a walk !
aye !
not to the boats?
hold fire !
this is just like what the greeks done at troy .
except they was in a horse instead of dresses .
wooden horse .
a moment , please .
i just want you to know i believe you made a very good decision today .
couldn t be more proud of you .
but you know , even a good decision if made for the wrong reasons ... ... can be a wrong decision?
lieutenant?
are you there?
elizabeth , are you even listening to me?
oh , what have you done?
stop that !
i already feel like a fool .
you look nice , though .
i must admit , jack , i thought i had you figured .
it turns out that you re a hard man to predict .
me?
i'm dishonest , and a dishonest man you can always trust to be ... ... dishonest .
honestly .
it's the honest ones you want to watch out for .
because you can never predict when they're going to do something incredibly ... ... stupid .
you re off the edge of the map , mate .
here there be monsters .
roger that !
what would you pick to eat first?
i think we should decide now .
just so we're ready when the time comes .
what was that?
it s elizabeth !
make for the ship !
move !
the ship !
you can t beat me jack !
that s interesting .
couldn t resist , mate .
so what now , jack sparrow?
will it be it two immortals locked in ...
an epic battle until judgment day and trumpets sound?
or you could surrender .
all of you with me .
will is in that cave and we must save him .
ready?
and heave !
please , i need your help , come on .
any port in the storm .
cotton s right , we ve got the pearl .
what about jack , you re just going to leave him?
jack owes us a ship .
there s the code to consider the code?
you re pirates , hang the code and hang the rules .
they re more like guidelines anyway .
bloody pirates !
is it supposed to be doing that?
they re stealing our ship .
bloody pirates !
come on !
i m gonna teach you the meaning of pain .
you like pain?
try wearing a corset .
whose side is jack on?
at the moment?
no fair .
ten years you carry that pistol and now you waste your shot .
he didn t waste it .
i feel ...
... cold .
parlay?
the ship is ours , gentlemen .
we should return to the dauntless .
your fianc will be wanting to know you re safe .
if you were waiting for the opportune moment ... ... that was it .
now if you il be so kind , i d be much obliged if you d drop me off my ship .
i m sorry , jack .
they done what s right by them .
can t expect more than that .
jack sparrow ...
captain .
captain jack sparrow .
for your willful commission of crimes against the crown .
said crimes being numerous in quantity and sinister in nature .
piracy , smuggling ...
this is wrong .
commodore norrington is bound by the law .
as are we all . ... impersonating an officer of the spanish royal navy ... ... impersonating a cleric of the church of england ... ... sailing under false colors , arson , kidnapping , looting , poaching ... ... pilfering , depravity , depredation and general lawlessness .
and for these crimes you have been sentenced to be on this day ... ... hung by the neck until dead .
may god have mercy on your soul .
governor swann .
commodore .
elizabeth .
i should have told you every day from the moment i met you ...
i love you .
marines .
can t breathe .
elizabeth .
move !
i thought we might have to endure some manner of ill conceived escape . ... attempt but not from you .
on our return to port royal , i granted you clemency .
and this is how you thank me?
by throwing in your lot with him?
he s a pirate .
and a good man .
if all i have achieved here is that the hangman will earn two pairs ... of boots instead of one , so be it .
at least my conscience will be clear .
you forget your place , turner .
it s right here , between you and jack .
as is mine .
elizabeth .
lower your weapons !
for goodness sake put them down !
so this is where your heart truly lies , then?
it is .
well !
i m actually feeling rather good about this .
i think we've all arrived at a very special place , eh?
spiritually , ecumenically , grammatically .
i want you to know that i was rooting for you , mate .
know that .
elizabeth ... ... it would never have worked between us , darling .
i m sorry .
will .
nice hat .
men !
this is the day that you will always remember as the day that you ...
idiot .
he has nowhere to go but back to the noose .
sail ho !
what s your plan of action?
sir?
perhaps on the rare occasion , pursuing the right course ... ... demands an act of piracy ...
piracy itself can be the right course .
mr. turner .
i will accept the consequences of my actions .
this is a beautiful sword .
i would expect the man who made it to show the same care and ... ... devotion in every aspect of his life .
thank you .
commodore !
what about sparrow?
well ...
i think we can afford to give him one day's head start
so , this is the path ... ... you've chosen , is it?
after all ... he is a blacksmith .
no ...
he s a pirate .
i thought you were supposed to keep to the code .
we figured they were more actual ... guidelines .
thank you .
captain sparrow .
... the black pearl is yours .
on deck you scabbarous dogs !
man the braces !
now ... bring me that horizon .
and really bad eggs .
drink up , me 'arties yo ho ...
