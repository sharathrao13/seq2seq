so , i'm dead ... and i think it's because of this redhead .
do you know who i am , jake?
the antichrist?
i'm just a guy looking for some answers .
hey , you know , pal , ain't we all?
things are probably gonna end bad for you tonight , jake .
yeah , i'm starting to get that feeling .
is your life flashing before your eyes?
honestly?
just the last three weeks .
it's not a bad place to start .
calm down , okay?
i'm sorry .
i lost my head in there , i don't know what happened .
you fucking shot him , that's what happened .
what other fucking choice do i have?
the motherfucker was gonna welch .
did you not hear him?
did you not see him?
i can't be here , man , do you understand me?
i can't fucking be here !
listen to me , all right?
it went to shit , that happens sometimes .
oh , fuck , man !
you're not listening , lionel .
we can still get through this , we still have some time , but i need you to use your fucking head , and i need you to trust me .
can you do that?
let's go !
come on , let's hustle it up .
come on , grab his feet , will you?
lionel , he's dead , all right?
maybe you didn't pull the trigger , but you were standing right there and you saw me do it .
now grab his fucking legs .
tick tock .
hey , you wanna help , then help .
if not , shut your piehole .
your mess !
do me a favor , please , shut your fucking mouth .
my place .
maybe now , you'll shut the fuck up .
please !
you think this kind of shit hasn't happened here before?
given , it's usually on wednesday and usually i tell the cops ,
no , officer , i didn't get a good look at the shooters .
usually , anyway ...
i swear to god , i didn't see anything .
you let me go , i won't say a word , i promise .
don't get hysterical on us , sweetheart , all right?
i can't fucking be here !
then you know what , lionel , maybe you should go .
what about the money?
what about this situation makes you think
i can answer that question , right now?
fuck !
fuck !
freeze !
freeze , you motherfucking cocksucking scumbags !
all right , guys , stop waving those things ...
what took you so fucking long?
jesus christ !
it's like 100 degrees in here and i'm lying in this shit forever .
what the fuck !
you guys were late , we had to go to a mexican stand off .
we had to go to gunplay .
gentlemen , that isn't our racket .
we were busy fighting crime .
you're keeping the streets safe from pedophiles and drug dealers?
oh !
goddamn it .
i told you , you're using too much powder , look at my fucking shirt .
i understand , but you know something?
you don't get the nice splatter effect .
look at this splatter effect .
the ones with blood come out of your cut .
i can live with that .
hey , jake , when do i get to play the inside?
gordo plays the inside .
you are the shill , you know that .
yeah , but come on , all i do is cry and get insulted here .
what are you talking about?
you should get a fucking academy award for the shill work you do .
big al , does anyone do it better than you?
come on , we've got a good thing going here .
you want to jinx us by changing things?
yeah , you're right , i don't want to jinx anything .
of course i'm right .
here you go , that's your cut .
thank you .
good work , paisan .
what?
it's a lot of cash .
he came up with it awfully quick .
did you see how quickly he got out of here?
he's not coming back , it's over .
okay , fine .
i've gotta pinch a loaf .
did anybody mess up the hoop?
it's clean .
gentlemen , 10 % , your cut .
enjoy !
you guys got a lot of sack , man .
i'll give you that much .
it's confidence .
just confidence .
it doesn't matter what the con is .
insider trading , a line we got at a bookie club , insurance scam , whatever .
you've seen the money and you want it .
more of it .
so who cares if you have to bend the rules a little bit?
as long as nobody gets hurt .
but then somebody does .
tommy suits always said , " a confidence game is like putting on a play , where everyone knows their part .
the inside man , the roper , the shills , everyone , that is , except for the mark .
so now you're an accomplice in a homicide .
everything you thought you were in control of , just flew out the window , or is dripping down your leg .
you should be running out the door , desperate to forget that this ever happened , and ready to repent your greedy ways .
what about the money?
then there it is again , that itch .
there's a guy standing in front of you with a smoking gun , another guy on the floor bleeding all over the place , and all you can do is think about the money .
you're a sick twisted fuck .
so we gotta make sure we give you the blow off .
we have to make sure that you never ever come looking for us again .
we have to get you off of our backs , forever .
that's why we give you the fix .
fuck .
fuck !
fuck !
fuck !
lapd's finest .
half as smart and twice as crooked
as the guy they just chased away .
freeze !
motherfucking scumbags ...
sucking fucking cocksuckers !
grifters .
we all can't be model citizens such as yourself .
it's all about the money , isn't it?
ain't it always?
that's what makes us run .
what's your name?
dutch .
and despite what they say ...
i love that name .
me too .
it can buy you love .
check it out , original leather seats , soft top , and you're gonna love this , suicide doors .
nice !
it can say everything about you .
it can erase all those things about you , you wish didn't exist .
it's alphonse .
i wanna settle up .
no , i haven't been ducking you .
i told you , i get it .
it can make you think you're on top of the world .
and if you believe that money can do all that for you , you are the perfect mark .
oops !
wasn't it jack kerouac who said ,
if you own a rug , you own too much .
i don't necessarily like kerouac , and driving cross country isn't my idea of a good time , but the guy's got a point . ... three messages .
hey , it's monica , bill .
i'm still dizzy from the other night .
call me .
hi scott , just thought i'd call you and tell you i'm back .
you know the number , it's kate , by the way .
bruce , it's cheryl , if you don't want to see me , just say so .
but this is the last time i'm calling .
if you've got nothing , you've got nothing to lose .
but when it comes to money , whether it's finding it or losing it , you just have to remember how much of it is just luck .
oops !
just dumb fucking luck .
mr. dolby?
mr. king would like a word with you .
now?
right now?
we have a car waiting .
hello .
you better get over to al's now .
for what?
hello?
nothing .
who the fuck? !
there's a couple hundred bucks on his dresser .
all of his shit's here .
this definitely wasn't a random thing .
is it ever a random thing?
shit , al .
what did you do?
let's just think about this ...
this fucking town , man .
jesus christ , i had a bad feeling about la .
didn't i say that?
this damn fucking town !
gordo , now is not the time for that , all right?
i'm sorry , i'm just a little ...
jesus christ .
look at what they did to him , jake .
right in the middle of his egg foo yung .
think they know about us?
what if they get to us too?
don't start freaking out , okay?
let's get al out of here first .
miles , get a blanket or something .
no , we're going to leave him right here .
what are you , high?
we're not leaving al here .
grab that end , now .
grab it , miles !
miles , pick up the table and put it back .
gordo , let go of the fucking rug .
i said we're leaving him here .
drop it .
fuck you !
how long have we worked with this fucking guy?
i'm not going to just fucking leave him here !
all right?
gordo , get a fucking grip .
we're leaving him here .
big al used to send money to his father , a vietnam vet slowly losing his mind in a va hospital in cleveland .
al was like that .
now you coming?
that's why al never played the inside .
there he is .
so what do you hear?
well , lionel dolby came down with a sudden case of drowning last night .
they just pulled him out of the silverlake reservoir .
now i know why he was such a good rope .
i mean , cash , that much , and we never had to put him on the send?
turns out this fucking mope is an accountant for the king .
the what?
who's that?
the cash we fleeced off him was collection money .
bookies , pushers , you know , whatever .
he was supposed to take that money and give it back to the king earlier yesterday , like he does every thursday , except this time that fucking stenad figured he could make a little something off of us and still get the money back to king before anybody says , " boo .
okay , what's a king?
currently?
a very large type pole stuck right up our asses , miles .
mob?
no .
no .
independent .
winston king .
he likes to call himself " the king .
how'd they get to al?
it's beautiful .
last night al calls some bookie out in redondo , tells them he's got the cash to settle up .
because , apparently he's been ducking this guy for like a month .
classic fucking al , right?
so the bookie asks where he's got this money , all of a sudden .
does al tell this guy that he just cashed a fucking bar mitzvah bond?
that he's been giving head for 20 bucks a pop?
no .
no .
the fucking idiot starts going on and on about how this job he just pulled , how he fleeced dolby ... how he fleeced ...
you pissed we didn't get credit?
no , no , no .
that was the only semi fucking smart thing he said .
except , anybody that's ever met big al knows the only thing he's comfortable doing alone is eating .
so this guy tells that guy , that guy tells some other guy , eventually it gets back to someone who works for the king and ...
shazaam .
any idea who the shooter was?
specifically?
i don't know .
but , i'm sure they're looking for us , too .
all right , just an idea , let's divvy up the cash and split .
excuse me .
are you new?
is that the thing?
is he new?
miles , this guy holds a grudge better than my ex mother in law .
you remember that moshe macelli?
that jew italian guy from boston?
they used to call him matzo mazzarelli?
remember that?
the guy with the face spaz?
it's called a facial twitch , miles .
and the guy was not born like that , you know .
five years ago , matzo was turf fixing for the king at santa anita , and he skimmed two grand before skipping town .
five years later king finally catches up to him , keeps him chained in his fucking bathroom for like five days .
oh , god .
now just say the word king , and he spits up all over himself .
jesus !
pathetic .
even words like vi king and shrin king , they set the guy off .
that's a five year grudge over $2000 .
so we go talk to him .
whoa , whoa , whoa , you wanna give the money back?
i didn't say that .
pittsburgh .
madrone .
pittsburgh is where it's happening .
bird flew into my house last night , too .
not a good sign , gordo .
the euclid was our place .
gordo fleeced the deed off some jack off in a card game .
we used it every now and then for a rag , but mostly it was our office .
our power point .
what are you doing?
where the hell's that going?
we want insurance?
jesus christ , miles .
i'm just asking .
just mail it .
yeah , i'm looking for the king , please .
just tell him it's regarding an accounting problem .
yeah , he'll know .
hollywood and vine?
okay .
when?
two hours from now .
but just me .
fuck that .
we're going too .
let's all just put our dicks back in our pants for a second , okay?
is this the best thing to do , jake?
how do you know the king is going to let you walk , jake?
'cause i'm getting a ride .
don't be dicking around in there , okay?
and if he shoots you or stabs you or causes you to bleed profusely , call a cab , 'cause your ass ain't getting back in here .
thanks , guys .
we appreciate your punctuality .
mr. king is expecting you .
lupus !
you said to pat him down , so i'm patting him down .
it only takes a moment to be polite .
my apology , mr. vig .
if you wouldn't mind?
so you the guy that got big al?
nope .
mr. king farms out that kind of work .
please .
after you .
wait with the ladies .
harlin .
okay , now you see that right there?
find out who she is .
make a note .
i think it's channel 42 or 3 .
a little harder .
the girls are here and the kid .
also got the seldin brothers with a shipment .
bring them in .
which?
whatever .
the brothers , the girl or the kid?
oh that's good .
whoever .
come on .
i'm getting a massage , harlin .
you got it , boss .
jake , ladies .
harlin , i think i bet that dog .
go !
go !
go !
hey .
well , look it here .
hi , girls .
hi .
so , are you two together?
we're sisters .
i like sisters !
jake , i can't quite see .
why don't you move a little bit , so that i can check them out then you can check them out?
thanks .
sisters , huh?
mm hmm .
and you're over 18?
yeah .
harlin , let's see what the sisters can do .
put them in the booth .
ladies .
oh , by the way , he had an escort .
lapd .
that's a little overreacting , i'm not gonna hurt you .
it's just a little insurance , that's all .
uh huh .
so , they're on the take for you .
shh .
you must be pretty good if you got cops driving you around .
is that because you look so innocent , and you're kind of cute there aren't you?
yeah , it's something like that .
so what do you do , tiger?
you just con people out of their money?
there is actually some technique to it .
you mean , like ... style .
yeah , it helps , don't you think?
no , style is at the end of my list , i'll tell you why , when i was a young man like you just starting out , my first big score , this guy we robbed .
i think his name was ...
chinatown schmidt !
it was nothing big , my end was about $800 .
the first thing i did , i go out and get myself a suit , right?
yeah , i looked good .
it was like white .
it was white .
it was white white .
white , white , white , white , white !
oh , i looked good , man .
i walked down the street , everybody was checking me out .
male and female .
i'm sure they did .
anyway , the first day i wore it out ,
october , it was still hot out .
we were kicking back in malibu and chinatown schmidt , right?
he catches up with us , so two guys roll by and boom , boom , boom , boom !
boom , boom , boom , boom !
six of us , scatter , man .
the dust settles .
everybody's checking their fingers and their toes .
and who is the one guy that got hit , sailor?
you know why?
white suit !
i was the first thing they saw , i was the first thing they aimed at .
i was the first thing they hit .
so what did i learn that day , jake?
don't wear white after labor day , maybe?
no .
sometimes , jake , style can get you killed .
mr. king , the girls are ready !
oh great !
wait , sport , you're gonna love this .
you ever been here before?
no , it's not really my thing .
oh , you don't know that .
tuesday we got disco night ,
wednesday is that electronic music shit ,
thursdays are gay and lesbian night .
that is very tasteful , by the way .
ow !
ow !
ow !
lupus , i want you to get me ...
lupus !
goddamn it , you're looking at them or you're working for me?
i want you to get me an espresso , please , and tell that bitch to give me back my slippy dips .
come on .
now !
let me ask you something , why one of my guys?
why lionel dolby?
my six year old nephew could con anything out of that dude .
why?
look , if we knew dolby was connected to you , we'd never have gone near him , so i apologize for any inconvenience .
honest mistake , all right?
it's just something between two guys that don't know each other yet .
so we're gonna make an exchange of the money and all will be forgiven .
isn't that right?
no .
that i won't do .
won't?
you won't .
you won't .
i want you to look very hard at me , motherfucker , and tell me why .
let me rephrase that .
that i can't do .
because a , i don't have the money , and b , you killed one of my guys .
one of your guys .
that's four spot , right?
yeah .
four .
one of your guys , huh?
i gotta take a pill , or i'm all over the place .
this is confidential , right?
yeah .
mm !
hey !
hey !
hey !
hey !
hey , stop it !
stop that right now !
they can't hear me .
harlin , get them outta there , goddamn it .
down !
down !
shit , man .
how do you like that?
they're sisters .
let me ask you something .
i want a straight answer now .
you did not know that dolby was connected to me?
you heard me before .
but it's so important that you don't stray from the truth in this one little part .
i didn't know .
you're a good grifter , man .
it's hard to tell when you're lying .
but i'm getting there .
come here , girls .
now listen , it's the first time i've ever put girls in the booth .
usually , they work their way up .
you're gonna go work on your routine , you know why?
because you're saying that you are sisters .
mm mm , we are sisters .
shh .
we're very close .
let me talk .
let me talk .
you don't like what we're doing?
of course i like what you're doing but i like it done with artistry , with grace , and that means , if you're gonna eat each other , you must find a way to do it tastefully , okay?
these are people here , they've got families , all right?
okay .
you understand?
then go work !
go on .
go on !
ladies .
tell me this , how are you and i gonna resolve our shit?
i get you what i owe you , plus interest , by going on the grift for you .
i like that .
okay , sit down .
put your baby cakes down here , that cute little irish muscle ass you got .
look , i came here to do a deal , not play grab ass with you , you freak , all right?
humor .
you heard my proposal
humor , jake , junior , buster , humor .
come on .
you wanna get out of here i gotta open up the place .
come on , sit down .
business .
come on .
all right .
here's what i ... you don't want to sit closer?
no , i'm fine over here , thank you .
all right .
can i see your hand?
you got a big hand .
let me see your hand , i'm not gonna bite you .
look at that hand , man .
you should have been a pianist , or a guitarist , look at the size of that .
wow .
see this?
that's your love line .
that's your money line .
and that's looking very very good .
and that's your life line , going all the way down ...
uh oh .
you see that little gap there .
it means that at one point you could have a little trouble .
but it's up to you to make it better .
i want you to talk to me and i want you to make me happy .
and i don't want you to scare me .
you do not want to scare me , junior .
what's gonna happen , now?
i play a con .
you get a cut , i get a cut .
we get square .
and i give you the who and you give me the how , right?
and you can because you're so good , right?
i like to think so .
okay , you're gonna do this with morgan price .
morgan price?
yes .
impossible .
why?
'cause you can't get to him .
he's too big .
you got to me .
yeah , but we got to you because ...
what?
you were a fluke , a mistake .
that's a good answer .
why morgan price?
'cause he's very important to me .
lupus !
don't fuck with me , junior , okay?
lupus !
you know what?
you're gonna take my friend lupus with you , okay?
absolutely not , that's not the way i operate .
shh .
i work with my guys .
you're gonna take lupus with you .
that's the way i operate .
look at me , now .
tell me we're set .
yeah .
we're set .
good .
we're done with all this business now?
the rest of it depends on you .
i think i'm done .
excuse me , miss?
miss !
i think you dropped something .
you know you're good , but you're not that good .
i spotted that lift from across the club .
wait?
you don't recognize me?
tony , could you get my car?
sure !
you really don't remember me , do you?
should i?
oh , right .
that's good .
so , you're interested in a little work?
you couldn't afford me .
not with $27 and a maxed out visa , john .
or is it tom or bill?
hard to tell with so many ids .
yeah , well , the name's jake .
and don't flatter yourself , sweetheart .
that's one thing i never had to pay for , and i don't consider it work .
guess you got the wrong girl then .
do me a favor , take a deep breath and count to 10 .
i'm talking about a grift , and it pays well .
unless you think you're gonna get rich jerking off geriatrics in that place .
i didn't know you cared .
keep the wallet .
we're even .
take a deep breath , count to 10 , and ... go fuck yourself !
look , it pays well .
six figures .
all you gotta do is play a part , do a little acting .
you think you can handle that?
why me?
you don't even know me .
'cause what i've seen , i liked .
and i got a good feeling about you .
hasn't anyone ever said that to you before?
no .
thanks , tony .
you bet !
but , i'll think about it .
all right , i think it will be worth your while .
make a wish .
11 : 11 , make a wish .
that's twice !
i can see why you liked her .
yeah , i liked her a lot .
and that was it , we had our crew .
now all we needed was the con .
bottoms .
oh ...
oh well .
shit !
what's up , guys?
who's the mope?
this is lupus .
he works with the king and now he's gonna be part of our crew .
i'm here to make sure things go smoothly .
anybody got a light?
and this is lily .
she's the new shill i was telling you about .
whoa .
whoa , whoa , whoa ...
hold the fucking phone , what is this?
are we playing a con , or are we doing a rendition of " our town "?
gordo , trust me .
we need the help on this one .
our new mark?
morgan price .
why?
because , that's who the king wants us to fleece .
and besides , the price is perfect .
i'm not supposed to wait for you , you're supposed to wait for me .
his old man was a big time mob attorney .
which makes him a second generation crook .
when he dropped dead , price carried on the family tradition , by opening a one stop shopping center for money laundering and low interest corporate fraud .
well , fuck him !
almost $1 billion gets washed through his shop every year , so we know he's got the money .
it's just a matter of getting to it .
how much are we going after?
$5 million .
we can only hold the king at 150 .
i know .
that's why we don't go after him directly .
first , we find a doable mark in price's bank , a mid level employee .
we meet him with papers , inquiring about a corporate loan .
our guy then fudges numbers in the right places .
moves our papers to the top of the pile or to the bottom , depending upon what we need .
our loan is approved .
on the given day , the money's wired into a corporate account in an offshore bank .
that same day , i show up in belize with the proper id , and corporate papers to make the withdrawal .
um mm .
what?
what is it , miles?
i'm just thinking out loud here ... but $5 million in a briefcase?
good point .
it's bank policy not to release this money in cash ,
'cause it's under a corporate account .
so we then cash the check at another bank .
any major airport's gonna be too hard to control .
lax is out .
so we use ontario .
mid level hub with direct international flights .
40 minutes outside la .
this is the most important part , you can't just walk into the united states with a suitcase full of cash , without evoking the words " cavity search .
that's why we need someone on the inside at customs .
then we disappear .
now this might just be me , but that is hands down the dumbest fucking idea i've ever heard .
people have tried this before , jake .
it's never worked .
teddy fraiser and his crew got nailed in vancouver last year .
it's never worked before , because , a , they didn't flush the bank enough ,
b , their corporate papers were for shit , and c , unlike us , they did not have somebody on the inside at customs .
yeah , or d , it's a dumb fucking idea !
hey !
what do you fucking suggest , miles?
you wanna run?
we never had a problem with that , before .
we never had a fucking problem like this before .
yes , we have , okay?
and we would have been beautiful about it .
we would have had a bucket of fried chicken , delivered to the king with a nice
kiss my ass card attached to it , and we would have moved on until the next local putz caught on .
we're getting too old to run , miles .
yeah well , we're still a little too young for san quentin .
look , i'm ...
i mean , are you pissed off about al?
look at me .
trust me , i'm pissed too .
but i'm not 25 to life pissed .
look , i'm getting clear of this .
all right?
so if you don't want to do it for the fucking principle , do it for the money .
gordo?
yeah , jake , whatever .
there's no whatever with this one .
you're either with me or against me .
no third position .
i'm in .
ah , what a relief .
oh , fuck .
i agreed with miles , it was hands down , a dumb fucking idea .
but they bought in , now i had to deliver ...
yeah , it's vig .
and i needed help .
what are we gonna do with this stuff?
i mean , heroin .
what do you do with heroin?
you sell it .
to who?
don't be a knucklehead .
how hard do you think it is to sell one drug dealer's drugs to another drug dealer?
if vig is right , we're looking at 100 , 150 .
you think it's a good idea?
we never done this shit before .
well , what is he gonna do , file a missing drug report?
hey if it works out , we could turn the guy over a few times .
i hope so , bro '.
i took my daughter to the orthodontist , yesterday .
150 bucks to tighten those bitches up .
took him five minutes .
then he said it wasn't even covered .
it's cosmetic .
the plan doesn't cover cosmetic .
i had a cap put in here , right?
my fucking dentist tells me , " you're not covered for that .
bullshit cosmetics !
i got a freaking tooth split in half here , all right?
write that shit in as a cavity or something .
did he?
yeah , he did .
fucking department got the bullshit dental plan .
that's our man , right there .
red bag , right?
is that the guy?
let's go .
hands up !
hey , hey , whoa , whoa , whoa .
what the fuck you got?
get on the ground .
so , how did you get caught?
tommy suits used to say that in any con , sooner or later somebody's gonna start asking the right questions .
usually , it takes a little longer .

i think we should ditch him .
no , we need him and dummy up .
here he comes .
ah , here he is .
hey , hey .

what's the matter with that?
manly , all right , wise guy?
that's cute .
you know this is a major metropolitan city , brother .
public sanitation does not run very high on the city hall agenda .
you know what you can get off a toilet seat or a doorknob?
you wanna run down the list?
hepatitis .
you ever hear of that?
influenza .
the fucking flesh eating disease .
i'm eating .
yeah , we noticed .

we gotta get down to business , here .
miles !
we're gonna need you to find us a mark inside of price's bank .
somebody we can work with .
gordo , we're gonna need papers .
corporate insurance , a letter of intent , the whole nine .
all fugazze?
no , no , no
corporate papers have got to be legit .
we're all gonna need new ids .
you gotta make sure they're clean .
go talk to suits , and he'll hook you up .
what about customs?
don't worry about customs ,
i'll take care of that .
we're gonna need some start up cash , first .
lupus , you think the king would be willing to bank us?
you already owe him .
lupus , we need a banker for this .
we can't do this job without a banker .
gordo , do we need a banker?
i think so , yes .
i think we need a banker .
i don't know , man
you could try .
he's not gonna listen to me .
i bet if you talk to him , loosen him up ,
maybe he'll listen to you .
all right !
i'll try , okay?
don't do us any favors , all right?
jesus , join the team !
so , you guys are good?
you know what you need to do?
yeah .
all right !
lupus , lily , we'll go over to see the king , now .
all right !
ready to roll?
let's do it .
i'm not finished .
she's not finished .
what's wrong with you?
where's your manners?
nice !
you know why?
because it's real .
you're licking each other .
feels good?
feels so good .
all right , that's it ... what?
what , what?
jake is here ,
he wants you to stake him a couple hundred grand .
no , he's supposed to be getting me money , not costing me money .
he says we need it .
and i gotta say , boss ,
this guy's pretty sharp , you know?
look at me , look at me .
you're getting a crush on him?
what are you talking about?
don't let him get into your head , 'cause he's a charmer .
you tell him to wait a minute and then you bring him in .
he's right behind you .
get outta here .
get outta here .
you're starting to scare me , sport .
harlin !
200k?
isn't that more than you owe me?
you're just gonna have to trust me on this , all right?
oh , no .
you're a day late on trust .
i think that what he's trying to say is that he'll ...
oh , oh , oh , oh .
you brought her for a reason , didn't you , booster?
let's listen to her .
no , why don't you listen up?
even though i'm running the show for you ,
i'm still running the show .
so we're gonna put an end to the scooter junior skippy sport tiger booster bullshit .
the name is jake .
what do you say you get the add under control?
you look me in the eye when i'm talking to you .
what's your name , honey?
her name is lily .
booster , have i ever referred to you as honey?
have i , scooter?
it's a common mistake that jake is making when he says add .
what he really means is adhd , for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , see?
the important word is the h ,
hyperactivity .
i don't understand , why do you let her do that if you care about her?
it's poison , see?
feel my heart .
go ahead .
i bet it beats twice as fast as yours .
go on feel it .
i'm fine , thanks .
oh , come on .
will you feel my heart?
i'm not gonna bite you .
god , you feel good .
like a trip hammer , right?
see?
much faster ... than yours .
why am i enjoying this so much , jake?
because
i feel like she is too .
i'm sorry , i know that was tasteless , dear .
i was just trying to make a point to jake , okay?
what do you say you get your add under control , and we get to the fucking point?
ooh , i think jake is referring to my medication , which i thought was confidential .
jacob , come on , come on .
you know why i take that stuff .
because if i don't , i become hyper , or primitive , right?
or impulsive .
you never know when i'm going to lose it .
now listen to me , okay?
hey !
i'm not a violent man .
i like to think i am above that , right?
you took my money and now you're asking for more .
and i'm gonna give you ...
i'm gonna give you what you're asking for ,
which is , how much?
tell me again .
200 .
200 , how much is that altogether?
including what you took from me the first time?
350 .
oh , that's very good , you're smart , aren't you?
you told me you were smart .
you're a smart , smart , smart guy !
so be smarter , huh?
don't get hurt .
don't scare me .
you've got a good , healthy , long life ahead of you .
i like you , now say , " we're set .
" we're set .
say it like you like me too .
come on , you can do it .
say , " we're set " like you like me .
we're set .
okay , now i want you to take your lovely ,
lovely lady home .
oh my god , you're beautiful .
let's go .
don't you ever , ever
let anyone stand behind me , without me knowing .
you hear me?
you understand me?
so the king gave you the money .
now , we just needed to find our guy in price's bank .
what you're looking for in a mark is someone whose weaknesses you can exploit .
michelle strigo , loan officer .
guy like me , people like that ,
i tell you what you're looking for without even meeting you .
you fucking asshole !
what the fuck is wrong with you?
you cocksucker !
it's like a personal ad you wear over your head .
she's not gonna work .
you sure?
jay housler , vp of international finance .
no .
leon ashby , vp of corporate loans .
what you're looking for in a mark is someone who has nothing to lose .
no friends .
no family .
no life .
you're looking for a guy who doesn't own a rug .
oh yeah , he's perfect .
you sure?
hey , i'm sure .
ashby was the right mark .
now i needed to see if lily was the right shill , so i tested her .
one watch engraved , " to carolyn ,
happy graduation counselor , love , mom and dad .
good .
one bracelet engraved ,
to annie , happy 25th anniversary , love , tom .
perfect !
i'll be right back , mr. lewis .
okay , thank you .
excuse me , i think you have something on hold for me .
do you have a ticket?
i lost it but the name is hanson .
okay thanks a lot .
mr. lewis , right?
yes?
jake hanson .
i go to law school with your daughter carolyn .
we met a couple of times , before .
oh , of course , jake !
it's good to see you again .
good to see you too .
you remember ...
lily !
this beautiful woman is my wife .
lily , this is carolyn's father .
oh , nice to meet you .
pleasure , i'm sure .
so , what brings you down from stanford?
taking advantage of the long weekend?
yeah , we're ...
it's our first anniversary !
congratulations !
that's great .
carolyn is down for the weekend too .
really?
mm mm , yeah .
maybe you can do me a favor then .
we split the cost on a couple of books , last semester , and i never got an opportunity to pay her back ,
i'll just write you a check .
there's nothing for hanson .
if we had a ticket , i could check the computer .
but yesterday , my wallet and my wife's purse were stolen , and the ticket was in my wallet .
maybe , you could check again .
jesus , where did this happen?
we're staying at the peninsula ,
i think it might have been the housekeeping staff .
but jake has a little more faith in humanity than i do .
he hates me saying it , but i think it's true .
you have to be so careful these days .
you sure do .
honey , i'm just gonna go and pick out a wallet .
it was nice to meet you .
nice to meet you .
there you are mr. lewis .
good .
i'm sorry , sir , still nothing .
may i ask what it was?
it's a shame , it was a pair of ... a pair of diamond earrings .
actually , it's just like those .
we have those in stock .
oh great .
let me write you a check only with the proper id .
yeah , i understand that but like i just explained to you , my wallet was ... this is sort of a very special day for my wife and i , it being our first anniversary .
she thinks we're here to pick up something for my mother , but i wanted to surprise her with something special .
so if you think you can make an exception today , just this one time .
i'm sorry .
thank you .
please , tell carolyn i said hello and pass the note for her .
i sure will .
it was good to see you again .
good to see you .
look , jake , why don't you write me a check , and let me put the earrings on my credit card?
is that all right with you?
if you'd be willing to do that , that would be great .
good .
please .
mr. lewis , thanks again .
you bet , jake .
happy anniversary .
all right?
now that's how you pull a con .
so smile like you just got a present from the man of your dreams .
thank you !
you're welcome , now let's give it a strong finish , all right?
he's gone .
oh yeah .
i gotta go get a haircut .
hey , how you doing?
hey guys , good to see you , man .
what's up , boss?
right here .
that's good .
what are you having?
i'm gonna go light ,
i'm gonna get the chicken and rib combo .
that's light?
yeah , i'm not getting the coleslaw .
so , what's good here?
who the fuck are you?
special agent gunther butan .
special agent?
i'm looking for jake vig .
who?
who?
the invisible man .
the specter , the spook , the ghost .
but then the other day , like a gift , a buddy of his , a crew member ,
alphonse moorely ... you know alphonse moorely .
he wakes up with a hole in his head .
look , special agent ... what's your name?
butan !
i got a pretty good sense of humor
like most people .
really , you've a sense of humor?
yeah , i do .
so if this is some kind of a fucking joke ,
i'm not into this shit !
a joke? !
a couple of years ago , i'm working undercover on a case that jake vig is involved with .
he's running some sort of scam importing merchandise for some guy in tampa .
and i got close , real close , and he knew it .
in order to let me know , and to rub it in , he sent me this tie .
since then , i've been following him , from chicago to denver to salt lake city , to phoenix and i've been wearing this tie ever since , because it keeps me motivated .
that's a real nice tie .
i don't know if it says , " special agent .
you know what it says?
it says ,
you can't catch me , so fuck you .
so fuck you .
and fuck you !
hey !
temper's a sign of weakness .
temper's a sign of weakness .
hey man , can we get you a glass of water?
i'm working at this temper management issue .
my doc says i should stay calm , because i might do or say something
that i might regret later .
look , special agent ...
sell one drug dealer's drugs to another drug dealer?
hey , hey , can you put that away?
wow !
hey , hey , hey ...
let's take a walk .
let's go for a walk .
now here is the deal ...
you guys are gonna help me catch jake vig .
whatever he's into next , you guys are gonna be into .
and whatever you're into , i'm into .
this fucking gun is killing my back .
in exchange , i'm gonna make sure you guys are cleared of any past associations with vig as part of a cross departmental investigation , and that home movie i got , i'll make sure that it doesn't move its way into internal affairs .
who knows?
this prick has been on the wish list so long , you two guys , might even get a promotion .
what the fuck are you getting out of all this?
peace of mind .
i might even get a chance to get rid of this fucking tie !
why are you looking at me that way , lloyd?
not everybody is on the take .
if you feds are so hot for this guy , why don't you just let us go out?
we'll bring him in , that's it .
a fox isn't a fox until he's caught in the henhouse .
oh nice .
what is that , an analogy?
a metaphor .
actually , it's neither but it is a good deal .
you guys go clean , i get peace of mind , and better yet , lloyd's daughter gets to keep her braces , and have that winning smile , just like her daddy .
one more thing , you guys can't be running around with heroin in your car .
let me tell you something about butan .
he's just as crooked as the next guy .
you'd think he'd have something better to do with taxpayer dollars .
well , cue the fucking violins .
come on , man , it's getting cold out here .
it was all in play .
everything !
and with a little luck , we're about to land the mark .
where the hell is she?
i have no idea .
she's 10 minutes late .
luck's a funny thing .
especially the bad .
she's nice .
black cats , breaking a mirror ,
breathe on a match .
it's about time .
believe it .
believe it all .
but if you really want to talk about bad luck , redheads .
you have got to be fucking kidding me .
shit .
lizzie borden , axe murderer ;
judas , betrayer ;
shirley vig , abandoner .
nice to see you too .
do you have any idea what you've done?
any idea?
what is with the hair?
what?
you told me to change it .
but the fucking grand poohbah of all jinxes , a bird in your house .
a bird enters your house , it means death .
what about this then?
what's with the scarf with the birds?
i mean , do you know what that means?
do you know what that means?
you have just put a mother of a jinx on us .
gordo , can you believe this?
we're dead .
we're dead .
did i miss something , guys?
sweetheart , it's the red hair .
it's bad luck .
it's not like she's a real redhead , jake .
look , it doesn't matter , all right?
you can't fool bad luck , you can't get by on a technicality .
you can't trick karma .
you just fucked us .
so much for that good feeling , huh?
that's what i get for putting a chick on the team , right?
gordo .
burn that .
lupus !
think fast .
lily , hold on a second , will you?
excuse me .
is this seat taken?
no .
please .
thanks .
oh , excuse me , i'm sorry i'm late , but i'm not that late .
you didn't have to give away my seat .
i didn't know you were coming .
i didn't know .
sorry .
no problem .
thanks for playing along .
i had to sit down for a while .
tough day?
brutal day .
what are you drinking?
maker's mark , on the rocks .
his rocks , mine straight up .
you got it .
my name is leon , leon ashby .
oh , god .
i'm so sorry .
i'm overbearing and rude .
lily .
lily finn .
so what do you do?
it's more like , what don't i do?
it's a long story .
well , we're getting drinks .
what happened?
my partners and i are trying to secure start up capital for a small tech company .
we tried the venture capitalist route , but since the bubble burst on dot coms ...
you're a few years off the mark .
a lot of bubbles were burst .
yeah .
optimists that we are , we thought we'd try our luck with a straight corporate loan .
there you go .
thank you .
oh , no , no , i can get this .
on me .
for the seat .
chin chin .
so we've been meeting with banks all day .
it's amazing how many ways they can say no without ever actually saying the word .
typically , a corporate loan is a fairly simple matter .
but you do have to demonstrate a capacity for gross fund recovery .
let me guess , your bubble didn't burst .
no , no , nothing like that .
i work in a bank .
really?
i wish we'd met eight hours ago .
good evening , gentlemen .
oh , my partners are here .
we have dinner plans .
oh , well , uh ...
thank you for the drink .
oh , you're welcome .
i was just going to ask if you'd like to join us .
sure .
okay .
so she got one leg out from under him , now we had to lean .
so then miles , god bless him , he walks right into the fucking creative director's office and he says ,
i'm sorry this program is for shit .
no , no .
and then he throws like a thousand pages of code
all over the fucking guy's office !
this is our boss , all right?
so he kicks miles and i out of the office , he's screaming and yelling ,
you're fired .
your whole fucking team is fired .
now he's looking for lily , he's looking for lupus ,
and of course he can't find gordo .
that's the best part .
he cannot find gordo , okay?
so what happens?
he finally finds ...
whoa , whoa , whoa ...
you don't have to tell this part .
he's in the bathroom .
so he kicks down the stall room door , and starts screaming at the top of his lungs .
and there's gordo , his pants around the ankles ,
pc world " mag in hand , and he's punching the cloud .
i'm sorry .
spanking .
frankly , i was spanking .
and it was a fucking traumatizing event , because i haven't been able to use a public restroom since that day .
me neither .
i swear to god .
gordo's got some issues .
he's got some issues .
and let's not forget , the great thing that did come from that day was we said , " enough !
that's the day we started our own business and said goodbye
to shithead bosses .
so ...
hear , hear .
i really admire you guys taking a chance like that .
leon here works at a bank .
what bank did you say it was?
price trust .
no shit , really?
talk about shithead bosses .
now that's gotta be a trip .
what's he like to work for?
oh , you know .
he's okay .
really?
oh , come on !
well , he's a ... he's just a fucking shithead .
what can i tell you?
so what do you do over there at price?
i'm the vp in charge of corporate loans .
wow .
we haven't met anyone of your level before .
vp .
wait , so that means it's you and then the p.
give that man a nobel prize .
well done .
genius .
yes , that's right .
here's where a little research comes in handy .
corporate banks give out vp titles like calendars .
it's a small lie , but now we're sure he's playing .
then maybe you can help explain to us what's so difficult
about getting a corporate loan?
well , normally , nothing .
but a tech firm right now?
people are really scared .
people are scared because they lack vision .
present company excluded , of course .
a bank does need to know where its money's gonna come from .
that is true .
we know where we're getting our money back from .
but therein lies our catch 22 .
i don't follow .
well ...
jake , come on .
no , it's all right .
leon here is one of the good guys .
right?
now what i'm gonna tell you is in complete confidence .
it does not leave this fucking table .
sure .
fine .
you know how the dot commers did what they did , right?
in what way?
how they made their money .
essentially , they start with an idea , shop it around town , raise a little capital , and then sold it to a bigger company ,
like a microsoft or an oracle or an intel .
you know , whatever .
that's half right there .
the beauty of it was , they sold it before the thing was even real .
so you've got the bigger company already set up to buy the thing .
they just want to see that it works .
so these guys go out , get some start up capital , make it work , and then sell for five or six times the initial loan .
they're delicious .
but you need a letter of intent .
exactly .
and that's our catch 22 .
we can't really go out and talk about it , because if it's public , potentially we start a bidding war , and that's considered a breach of etiquette .
kills the deal .
however , we wait too long , and we're not considered hot anymore .
and you have this letter of intent?
yes we do .
we're applying the dot com model to a different product .
yeah .
but the dot coms failed .
yeah , but that's only ...
no , with all due respect .
it ...
that's going to be a really tough sell .
i mean , you guys have a real battle on your hands .
that's bullshit .
lupus .
look , sorry , mr. ashby .
i didn't mean anything .
but i just don't think you can argue with the success of the business model .
it was really an overextension of the model to what turned out to be a limited consumer demand that caused the dot com collapse .
now , applied to a proper product , with a solid consumer base , the model still holds up .
he may be right .
let me be straight with you , all right?
we're this close to cutting somebody in on the action , if they'd be willing to help .
we just need to find somebody with some balls .
shall we order another round?
yeah .
lupus , nice save in there .
i'm very impressed .
poor bastard never knew what hit him .
jesus christ , i almost felt sorry for the guy .
i gotta go work off some of this adrenaline .
i have an in on a card game with some hollywood studio dipshits .
anybody want a piece?
i'm going home .
i'll go .
jake?
no , i'm good .
are you sure?
yeah .
oh , lupus , you should come .
you're gonna love these guys .
bunch of fucking knobs .
hey , lupus .
when this is all over , you'll let us know who the king put on big al , right?
you gonna have time?
i'll find the time .
you want to go , don't you?
for a couple hundred bucks?
not interested .
you'd do it for free .
you're almost drooling .
you like the rush .
it's not about the rush .
it's just a job .
it's what i do .
your mother not breast feed you or something?
you asking me if i got something to prove?
do you?
not in that repressed anger way .
i get the feeling you could've bullshitted your way into anything .
why this?
i'm good at it .
lying , cheating , manipulating .
it all came very naturally to me .
no , it's more than that .
the thrill of it?
i mean , didn't you find it exciting tonight?
the way you were working that guy ashby ... flirting , giving him your sweet little smile , brushing up against him , occasionally touching him ,
i have a feeling you were getting off on that tonight .
all i did was smile and shake my ass .
yeah , but you did it very well .
soon enough you'll have more to do and i have a feeling you'll be good at that too .
how do you know?
intuition .
she had you tempting fate .
my old man and his buddies from work used to play the same lotto numbers every week .
i mean the same numbers for 16 years .
one day he gets pissed , decides he's going to play his own number .
they then hit the lucky seven for 3 . 5 million without him .
that's fate for you .
i guess he passed on that unlucky asshole gene .
turn around .
you should have trusted me , jake .
yeah , apparently so .
everything looks in order .
you know , leon , we're going to have to move quickly here .
i know .
it won't go unnoticed .
what's this?
let's call that a convincer .
we're going to need to slow down a bit .
you're worried about recouping the loan , we got the letter of intent .
no , it's ...
i understand that .
what i'm trying to ... what i mean to say is ... what i'm wondering about is ... is my cut .
and there it is .
ashby gets the itch .
2 % .
of five million .
we're gonna make it back three or four times over .
by the time anyone catches on , the loan's already been repaid .
you didn't do anything wrong except speed things up .
all you need to do for your cut , is put some paperwork through , push a button tomorrow .
yeah , but there were other factors .
yeah , factors that weren't clear to me until now .
what do you got?
we got jack shit .
i'm not a confrontational man by nature , but you guys are gonna have to start working with me .
we haven't heard from vig .
we don't know if he wants to cut us in on this shit he's got going down with the king .
maybe you two guys need to be a little more pro active , lloyd .
you gotta make him think you're gonna keep me off his back .
and for that he's gonna cut you in on whatever he's got going with king .
you got that?
omar , you got it?
flight's booked to belize .
almost home .
got to get you home to pack .
get ready for your trip tomorrow .
can you picture me with a drink with the umbrella in it?
little sunscreen on the nose .
hey , jake !
back off !
back off !
whoa , whoa !
take it easy !
jesus !
what , the tip not work out for you guys?
tip worked out fine , we're just a little curious about the fed .
hey look , you don't pay your fucking taxes ...
get the fuck back !
back up !
special agent gunther butan .
that ring a bell?
gunther?
no , i think i would remember a gunther .
let me jog your memory a little .
jesus !
fuck !
gunther butan , you say?
i think i might know this guy .
yeah , well he's in town and he sure as shit remembers you .
what are we gonna do about this jake?
we can't afford having a fed onto us like this .
i wouldn't dream of that .
fuck , man !
the way we look at it , jake , you have a limited window of opportunity here before he catches up to you .
but i got good news for you , okay?
you got us .
we're your white knights .
we're gonna keep him off your back .
and we get a piece of whatever you got going down with the king .
and don't argue with me 'cause i got a lot of pent up aggression .
say something stupid if we got a deal , jake .
something stupid .
don't leave town , brother .
funny .
oh fuck .
have a nice day , officers .
how did we do?
we did exactly like you said .
i have complete faith in you , lloyd .
why's this guy so hard up for you?
you're not exactly a threat to national security .
we go way back .
a few years ago we were working in tampa for a local goon .
turns out this mutt was being watched by the feds , which now meant we were being watched by the feds ... one in particular ...
agent gunther butan .
we were just overseeing some creative importing , so he really didn't have anything on us .
but i figured , maybe this guy's good for a fix .
our guys in the lapd , give them $20 , they'll look the other way on a parking ticket .
maybe you'll get yourself a new tie with that .
but a fed?
you get a guy like that as your fix ...
it was probably a stupid idea .
there i was armani and rolex .
there he is , jc penny and timex .
so i took a shot .
now he had me on attempted bribery of a federal agent .
so that's how gunter butan and i became friends .
butan ... shit .
here .
so what?
we just stay clear of him .
i don't think so .
i think we gotta walk .
wait a minute .
we can handle this .
come on .
no .
not this time .
i say we walk .
wait .
take it easy for a second .
i'm not gonna take it easy .
'cause you don't know this guy .
he's gonna be all over us like white on rice .
there's no shaking him and you know it .
so we change the scam a little .
there is no more fucking scam .
i got a sign on my back now .
i can't leave town and then show up with a suitcase full of money .
it's over .
the gig is up .
jake , jake .
the skirt's got a point .
all you have to do is tweak it a bit .
it over .
that's it .
you gotta know when to walk away .
and you guys are too careless with the money .
gordo with the cars .
you with the strippers .
they call themselves dancers .
they call themselves dancers , huh?
what about big al?
did that not fucking register with you?
remember seeing him sitting there with a bullet hole in his head?
that doesn't mean anything?
you're being such a raving pussy .
i mean , pull yourself together , for christ's sake .
who the fuck do you think you're talking to?
sweetheart , we fucked once , okay?
that does not entitle you a voice in this room .
and don't think i didn't know you weren't working some angle , either .
easy , jake .
that's a lady .
everyone's working an angle , right?
there are three people i trust in this world , those two guys on the couch and a dead guy .
you , i don't know you .
you're like a stray dog that wandered into my house one day looking for a belly rub .
so why don't you just go back to wherever it is you came from?
you don't have anybody looking for you .
not the king , not butan , not price .
so just cut loose of this .
it is over .
what about ...
what about what?
what about the money?
there it is .
that little itch you need to scratch .
always about the money .
what do you want?
you want an apology?
no .
i want my cut .
take a deep breath , count to 10 , and try and get it through your thick skull , there is no cut .
you're an asshole .
so that's it , huh?
that's it .
we're closing up shop .
you guys know what to do , right?
jesus christ , jake , i can't believe you're gonna just ...
miles .
so much for honor among thieves .
you were going to cut loose your friends , your girl ...
what the fuck are you talking about?
i was doing it for them .
i was trying to protect them .
bullshit .
you weren't doing it for them .
you were scared .
come on , admit it .
you lost your nerve and you lost your confidence .
you weren't trying to be noble .
you weren't trying to save anyone but your goddamn self .
admit it .
you got no idea what you're talking about .
it's not true .
it is fucking true .
they were right there for you !
she was right there for you .
look at her .
i fucking said look at her !
she trusted you , and you sold her out .
now i want you to look at her , and i want you to tell her .
be a fucking man .
you be honest .
you tell her .
you tell her that you loved her , but the fucking money meant more to you .
fucking grifters , man .
gentleman's racket , my fucking ass .
just another low life scammer looking out for number one .
get the fuck up !
get the fuck up !
the king ain't gonna like this .
he had a real thing with getting this price guy .
if you ask me , i think he's jealous .
of what?
they're both crooks .
they actually grew up in the same neighborhood .
king talks about it all the time .
how come he's always humping it out , while price gets to walk around in three piece suits , hobnob with movie stars , own a bank , that type of shit .
next to price , the king is still small time and he's pissed off .
a point , lupus .
give us a point .
i don't give a shit if he thinks he's a pimple on price's ass .
he wouldn't piss on my face if my teeth were on fire .
that's nice .
interesting imagery .
look at that .
the size of a cigar , right?
you know why i got that?
the king asked me for a four shot one day .
that's four shots of espressos .
turns out we only have enough coffee for a three shot .
so i'm thinking , maybe i'm doing him a favor .
and before he even comes picks it up , he's screaming at me like i just hit on his mother !
i assume this is going to lead to some kind of point .
this is what i get for bringing him the wrong fucking cup of coffee , imagine what he's going to do to you .
i have to admit , he did have a point .
there was no way the king was going to let us slide .
yeah , so we were back on .
after you cut her loose?
which was apparently my mistake .
how'd you know we'd still go through with it?
i know you , jake .
and i know how to take care of myself .
morgan price , please .
yeah , i'd be interested in that .
why don't you give me an address and i'll send over a car?
and you and i can discuss the particulars of your proposal .
no .
i come to you and i only deal with you .
it was a smart play .
she handed me to you on a silver platter .
silver platter?
motherfucker , let me tell you a story .
that's an exciting story .
travis , anybody ever try something like this before?
not that i can recall .
and how much did you say you wanted for this finder's fee?
10 % .
i studied under a nobel laureate of economics at cambridge and i think even she'd say 10 was high .
i don't give a fuck if you studied at marice's academy of wig design .
you're lucky i'm even here .
10 is standard .
okay .
travis , see if you can get him to tell you how he did it .
or almost did it .
sounds like a good story .
oh , i'll get it .
come on , what happened today?
today?
today started off great .
ashby was going to call us with the exact time of the transfer .
the king was waiting on us .
just to be safe , gordo was boarding the plane instead of me .
i needed manzano and whitworth to keep butan off our backs .
so i had to stay in town and cut them in on the deal .
so they waited for my call while miles and i waited for ashby .
she should be landing right about now .
that customs guy is ready , right?
i feel lucky today , miles .
real lucky .
found a penny , heads up .
and i got rid of the redhead .
yeah .
we got rid of the redhead .
jake?
customs?
they say a good chess player can see up to 20 moves deep .
that means in some games you've calculated every move in your head .
the game's over , even before it's really started .
like a game of chess , same with a con .
you have to see that deep .
yeah?
ashby ,
it's vig .
jake , yeah .
it's going through ... right ... now .
good .
and with the push of a button , all the pieces were in play .
gordo?
it's all good .
do it .
first and goal .
hi there .
i'd like this cashed , please .
mr. ashby?
mr. thompson from international calling .
he has a 34 r on a corporate account in belize .
that's probably just a new account marker , i'll ...
to ensure we weren't going to welch ,
ashby's cut was transferred into his own offshore account .
tell you what .
i am going to lunch .
you tell him i'll call him back later .
we called them the green twinkies .
we got twinkies .
gordo , that's outstanding .
good work .
lupus , we got the money .
i don't believe this .
gordo's flying back with it now .
so we'll head on over to the bar , meet up with everybody there .
i sent miles to the airport to wait for gordo to land .
everything was going as planned .
gordo?
gordo , do me a favor .
just use the bathroom on the plane , all right?
gordo?
gordo !
guy's walking around with $5 million cash and he's going to stop to use a public bathroom at the airport?
un fucking believable .
that guy's got a serious problem .
you're telling me .
here's where i got stupid , here's where i got that big fucking itch .
what?
i got something on me?
i'm going to be straight with you , lupus .
i don't think we could've gotten this far without you .
so i got a little proposition for you .
a way for us to clear the whole five million .
now think about that , five million split four ways .
you want in?
what do i have to do?
all right .
yeah , it's vig .
i'm gonna need an escort .
not a ride , just an escort .
ontario airport .
look for gordo .
he's going to be carrying a black nike duffel bag .
you guys take care of butan?
don't worry .
we got him covered .
all right , good .
that was him .
there's a shipment coming in this afternoon .
ontario airport .
we're going to give mr. jake vig the surprise of a lifetime .
fbi agent rosen speaking .
artie .
butan .
yeah .
ontario airport this afternoon .
come heavy .
all we need you to do is call the king .
tell him it's all good .
get the king off of our backs .
yeah , boss , it's me , lupus .
you were right .
he's trying to fuck you .
what?
vig's trying to fuck you .
police escorts are going to pick up the money .
i knew it , i knew it ...
i should have listened to my instinct .
shit !
how do we get the money now?
you gonna have to take it in the airport .
the guy he's got a black nike duffel bag on wheels .
he's got this thing with bathrooms .
if he makes it through customs he'll be heading for the john .
that's good .
we'll get him with his pants down .
you'll take care of scooter once we get the money .
maybe gordo's got it right .
maybe we're all just looking for a safe place to shit .
that's cute .
very cute .
what about all that bullshit at the bar?
about your three shot , four shot espresso sob story?
showing me your little boo boo .
what was all that fucking shit?
that?
i got that at a barbecue , grilling halibut .
you trust this butan guy?
i don't trust anybody .
i'm so sick of listening to this douche bag's shit .
i swear to fucking god .
if my kid's teeth weren't so fucked up ,
i'd love to walk up to that dude and take that gay hat of his and shove it right up his ass on principle .
you see how bad this guy wants vig?
it's like a sickness .
i say we collar him ourselves .
that way we got vig , we got leverage and we trade .
vig for the tape .
this is butan .
you guys awake?
yeah , we're here .
okay , stay sharp .
be right back .
is this it?
this it , harlin?
motherfucking no brains , this one has .
so lupus .
what do you do now?
you go back to fetching coffee for the king?
don't worry about me .
stop trying to fuck with my head .
okay , i got him .
he's heading towards the east exit .
do not under any circumstances apprehend .
i want you to follow him all the way down to vig's .
roger that .
we got that jerkoff .
let's go .
keep your pants on .
he just went into the crapper .
let's say gordo doesn't make it through customs .
you're gonna be just as fucked as we are .
you think about that?
not for nothing , jake , but the guy who whacked your buddy?
it was me .
the king usually farms out for that kind of stuff , but he was so pissed off at you he couldn't wait for the regular guy .
the fucker didn't even put down the kung pao chicken .
oo ooh , shit !
come on .
stand up .
what?
stand the fuck up !
jake , no offense , but i've seen you fight .
you gotta be kidding me .
okay , they pulled a switch .
black man , brown suit .
big .
hey , asshole .
keep 'em up nice and high .
what the ...
don't fucking move .
freeze !
freeze !
freeze !
put your weapon down !
we're lapd !
get down on your knees .
we're fucking cops .
lapd , man .
look at this , come on .
on the curb !
face forward !
all the way down !
hands on your head .
hands outside where we can see them .
bring him out .
nice and easy .
turn around .
can i make a suggestion?
take these cuffs home and use them on your wife .
you'll like it .
i like it tight , but not that tight .
how about you?
let's go .
oh .
look what we got here .
heroin .
two keys .
we're good .
he's good .
he's good .
he who?
you gotta like it .
officers manzano and whitworth ,
agent artie rosen ,
federal bureau of investigations .
how hard do you think it is to sell one dealer's drugs to another?
don't fucking say anything !
yeah .
the king just got pinched with the bag .
okay .
what happened?
he got caught .
what?
fucking king just got us all pinched .
oh shit !
what do i do?
what the fuck ...
lupus , just calm down .
lupus !
i never thanked you for that .
no problem .
can we all stop being so fucking polite and get to the point?
that's right , where's the fucking money , jake?
what do you get out of this?
a fucking finder's fee?
it's all about the money , isn't it?
fuck you .
you sold me out .
you sold me out huge .
you should have trusted me ,
like i trusted you .
you fucked up .
you fucked up huge .
all right , all right , now you turn the fuck around .
the only way you're gonna live is if you get me my fucking money !
now where the fuck is it?
i'm gonna ask you one more time before your brains hit the ground .
where is my money?
probably in the hands of the federal government .
you know jake , you ... you really fucking disappoint me , jake .
you just let lily down here again , too .
what was that you were saying about playing the big con , it's like putting on a big play , and everybody knows their part?
i guess some people forgot their fucking lines .
yeah , i guess so .
you guess so?
so why don't you just take a deep breath , jake , and i'm gonna count to 10 .
one , two ... three , four , five ...
i do trust you , lily .
six , seven ...
oh , shit !
what the ...
trust ...
did you kill him?
should be a four letter word .
i don't know .
don't do that shit while i'm standing right here !
you get the fuck away from me .
get the fuck out of here !
now !
so i'm dead .
but can i really blame lily?
should i just have trusted her?
who knows?
sooner or later , someone's gonna start asking the right questions .
the feds would want to know why were they sent in to just bust a couple of crooked cops .
manzano and whitworth would ask how the drugs got into that duffel bag .
the king and price would ask , where their money really went .
and everyone would ask , what agency was it that
special agent gunther butan really worked for?
you need a ride?
hey .
how'd it go?
smooth .
the guys we have in the lapd , give them $20 and they'll look the other way on a parking ticket .
maybe you'll get yourself a new tie with that?
but a fed , you get a guy like that as your fix ...
so what do you got going next?
so that's how gunther butan and i became friends .
look at you .
you're still working that crazy tie routine .
i'm partial to it .
you take your cut?
yeah , i'm good .
well , where you off to next?
wherever it is , don't stay too long , you know?
stay loose .
always .
i'd keep the girl .
sooner or later , all the right questions would get answered .
because playing the big con ...
what's this?
is like putting on a play .
a play where everyone knows their part , except the mark .
sometimes , jake , style can get you killed .
and like in a game of chess , you've played every move in your head .
yeah , boss .
it's me , lupus .
you were right .
he's trying to fuck you .
you're a good grifter , man .
it's hard to tell when you're lying .
it's hard .
but what do i care?
i'm dead .
nobody's gonna be asking me .
i think you dropped that , baby .
miles , would you be so kind?
absolutely .
