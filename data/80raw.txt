you got a $50 bill?
when do i get it back?
man , give me $50 !
it's all i got .
this is part of a $50 bill like billy's with the hidden barcode .
the corner tore .
happens all the time .
no , the barcode's going up , so it comes off this corner .
lf it comes off this corner it should have ink on it .
it's too big to be blank .
look !
it's oki doki !
don't let your brother get away .
i got to load my camera .
oki doki !
nice little kid .
how you doing?
good to see you .
i love you , oki doki !
oki , do the oki shuffle .
that's not right !
it's like this .
listen , i changed the steps .
you got a problem with that?
you're supposed to be nice , no matter what !
you little motherfucker ...
grandma !
grandma !
oki doki pushed me !
you take it already .

coffee .
would you like some coffee?
louis , how's it going?
fine , fine .
say hi to lrene .
will do .
louis?
follow me .
i wouldn't mind giving her a massage .
when dewald took over he stuck me down here on what he calls park safety watch .
he thinks he took me out of the loop , but as long as i have a computer
i can still access most of what's in the mainframe .
ls this the tunnel system?
yes .
do any of these tunnels lead to somewhere only dewald's boys can go?
no .
all park accesses are unrestricted to park personnel .
except for the happy forest .
that's being redone .
show me the happy forest .
that would be right here at the end of corridor b.
it's right after ...
it's right after ...
how long's it been closed?
too long .
i'm talking about the happy forest ride?
the forest .
yes , about a couple of weeks .
it wasn't very popular so they're trying some new ideas .
i think they found one .
can i have this?
sure .
thanks .
there you go .
you know ... when this thing is over ...
would you like to get together and have some dinner or something?
that would be nice .
can you put that in here?
sure .
there you go .
we have a date .
a date .
all right .
can you help me with this?
there you go .
remember , an elephant never forgets .
all right .
louis , how goes it?
fine .
nice to see you .
say hello to lrene .
you bet .
see you .
everything on schedule?
i had to tweak the image a little bit , but it's under control now .
foley's up there .
get him !
will the dewald family please come to tiny town?
the dewald family to tiny town .
but , honey , the happy forest is closed .
ok , i'll meet you at the main gate at 5 : 00 .
i'm sorry .
you're sorry?
this is detective axel foley .
i'd like to speak with agent fulbright .
could you patch me into his radio?
it's an emergency .
fulbright , foley .
i found what you're looking for .
i'm at wonder world .
fuck !
get out here now !
get me 91 1 .
all cars in the vicinity of wonder world .
proceed there immediately .
10 19 , 10 45 , and 12 22 in progress .
why am i not surprised?
all right , don't shoot !
i'll put my gun down .
i put my gun on the ground , and i'm unarmed .
don't shoot .
this is great .
you caught him .
good .
he broke into a security area .
relax .
save that shit for new talent night at san quentin .
i'm on to your operation .
my operation?
god damn it , axel , what have you done now?
he went berserk .
he was firing a weapon in the park .
there are hundreds of children around .
they don't give oscars in prison .
fuck you !
there's someone here from ...
fulbright , secret service .
i put you on a plane to detroit .
you're gonna be glad i stayed .
i know what you're investigating .
it's right here .
yeah?
and what am i investigating?
paper , us mint quality .
that's what was in that truck .
you wanted to follow the truck back to la to find his print shop .
it's right here in wonder world .
what is he raving on about?
he's insane !
he's proved that .
ln wonder world?
this place is as high tech as nasa and nintendo combined .
they got a hidden room under this closed ride .
i was in there .
that's why they were chasing me .
my men were pursuing mr foley because he's delusionary and potentially dangerous .
this room , delusionary also?
no .
there is a closed ride , which we use to ...
i'd better take a look at it .
maybe we'd better look at it .
right here .
counterfeit bills , out of this machine .
ls this true?
'fraid so , officer .
'fraid we've been caught red handed , right , ellis?
'fraid so .
would you like to see them?
first quality .
make a run , donald .
we call them wonder world dollars .
redeemable for admission , rides , souvenirs .
it's our big christmas promotion .
we're giving it away to elementary schools across the country .
you must be in on this .
you supply equipment , he supplies paper , right?
they changed it to this shit after i left .
after we leave they'll put it back .
what's this paper?
ordinary rag .
they switched it .
i am tired of these accusations , officers .
i want this man arrested for public endangerment .
could i speak with you a moment?
god damn it , we spent a fucking year with our noses up dewald's ass !
we're this close to locking this up , and you piss all over us !
our case is blown .
you're going back to detroit , and if you weren't a cop ,
i'd have you doing dead time in leavenworth for life .
detective flint , he's yours .
let's go , axel .
make sure he doesn't get on the plane .
i got a wife , three kids , a mortgage and a pension that won't cut it .
that job at wonder world is my retirement plan .
we're being followed .
it's the security guards at wonder world .
they probably want to make sure you get on that plane .
because of you , my future is in real fucking jeopardy .
dewald is pissed .
sanderson won't think too highly of me .
hold up !
stop the car !
that liquor store .
stop !
what?
oh , shit !
wait !
it's all right .
don't worry .
i'll get him .
when i do , i'll kill him !
axel , i left as soon as i got your call .
are you ok?
i'm fine , but i want you to think back to the night fry disappeared .
maybe you forgot something .
no .
why would you think that?
because this note by itself ... it just don't make no sense .
this is important .
life and death .
why would he even send that?
not " help , i need to talk to you , " nothing .
just this .
oh , shit .
fry must have found some sample paper .
he knew they'd kill him so he sent it to you .
there's a barcode .
what does that mean?
it used to belong to uncle sam .
now we got evidence .
we can put sanderson and dewald's ass in jail .
i don't think so .
i figured you'd call uncle dave here , so we followed him .
i actually was a real cop once so i know how you assholes think , which is to say , slowly .
very slowly .
so you were carrying the evidence the whole time , sherlock?
here's the real ending of the story .
let's see if you like it .
we heard you were loose .
you had a grudge against the park .
i feared you might try to harm our beloved uncle dave , so i raced over here as fast as i could to try and stop you , but alas , it was too late .
get him all the way in the car .
take it .
take it .
you worried about fingerprints?
forget it .
look at the gun .
it's yours .
give me your weapon .
throw that gun in the street !
close the door and get over there !
hold on , uncle dave .
damn it !
don't you die on me , man .
i got an emergency out here .
it's a gut shot .
come on !
that was uncle dave .
pressure?
90 over 40 and dropping .
i got to get his pressure up .
let's go , guys .
i need oxygen .
let's go .
on three .
one , two , three .
get an arterial line in him .
any medical history?
i've been shot before , but it's no big deal .
where's the coffee machine?
down the hall .
this is an all city alert for a suspect in the thornton shooting .
suspect is an african american male ...
you hear some black guy shot uncle dave?
no?
come on , let's get out of here .
did you hear?
somebody shot dave thornton .
somebody shot uncle dave?
ls there a tv here?
yes , of course .
authorities believe that foley attacked uncle dave in retaliation for some personal rejection .
the much loved uncle dave is undergoing surgery at this moment .
according to hospital sources , the prognosis is bleak .
how does a psycho like that live with himself?
janice , axel .
get out of the park .
they're going to kill whoever knows about roger fry's note .
janice can't come to the phone right now .
can i take a message?
lf you do anything ...
it'll be your fault .
i want you at wonder world within the hour .
come to the main gate alone and unarmed .
and bring the mint paper .
then you let us go?
lf you don't show up here in a half hour , alone , unarmed and with no cops , i kill your friend .
and it wouldn't be the first time , would it?
we have an amateur video of the incident this afternoon involving uncle dave's assassin , axel foley .
all right , don't shoot .
i'm putting my gun down .
i'm putting it on the ground .
i'm not armed .
don't shoot .
that was an amateur video shot earlier today by a tourist .
would you please take special care of my car?
yes , sir .
thank you .
shit !
ackwell ...
serge , i need a weapon .
i don't have any weapon .
i take all back .
what about this?
this is the floor model .
people been breathing on it , coughing on it ...
serge , i need a weapon now .
donny .
donny , ackwell in some kind of rush , ok?
so take the annihilator and wash it off with some cologne , and take the case and make sure it's nice and pretty .
it's corinthian leather .
billy , axel calling .
axel , listen .
am i your friend?
i'm sure you can explain , or maybe you can't explain , but you've got to turn yourself in .
i'm going to wonder world .
no !
wait for me !
axel !
put your arms out and hold for a pat down .
foley just arrived , sir .
take him to control .
we have foley .
come on .
how much do you want run?
all of it .
are you ok?
let's have the paper .
there's a porsche by the front gate .
there's a phone inside .
when she calls , i'll give you it .
i don't think so .
then we got a stalemate .
not quite .
orrin ...
we kill you both .
the paper don't mean jack shit .
how you know i didn't mail it to the secret service?
he's bluffing .
you think so?
call me .
orrin , i know how cops think .
the note is in the car .
the keys , foley .
give me the fucking keys .
drop that fucking gun !
again?
drop it !
axel , what are you doing here?
what happened?
it's the coolant safety system .
protects the mainframe in case of fire .
how do we get it open?
we can't .
not from this side .
he's trying to use an outside line .
do something !
hello , police?
shit !
foley's loose in the park !
i repeat ...
foley's loose in the park !
get him !
mr dewald !
we gotta do something .
call for help !
there's just the modem line for the computers .
i got it !
just let the computer dial ...
the phone would just ring and ring .
that's it .
what good would that be?
a lot of good .
we can call flint's pager .
foley is in hometown square .
repeat , foley is in hometown square .
foley is heading for alien attack .
attention .
this is a red alert .
aliens are invading the city .
board the subway trains for immediate evacuation .
he ran up those stairs .
i need that right away !
damn it .
not again .
excuse me .
dispatch , this is flint .
trace that number that keeps calling me .
555 4085 .
it's a computer line at the wonder world theme park .
call and tell them their computer's broken .
we tried , but all the voice lines are down .
must be that uncle dave shooting .

get to a phone and call the police .
i'll try and find axel .
