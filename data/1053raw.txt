he didn't think you'd fall for that line .

tail having anything that moves humping ass dog .
you need to kick him to the curb .
oh , no , no .
don't cry , karen .
karen .

men are so full of it .
give a brother a break , treat him with trust ... ... and he'll screw you around .
sorry i'm pissed off now , but my best friend is having man trouble .
miss smith , tracye johnson's on line 2 .
i'm in a meeting , but i'll be there in an hour .
tracye .
another one of my girlfriends .
man trouble too .
seems like every woman i know has man trouble .
have you noticed around spring men start to act up a bit?
they do .
they don't act up in the winter .
they want that indoor activity .
but as soon as the season breaks , they show their asses .
it's true .
it happens every year around spring , the breakup season .
the time when women wear miniskirts and skimpy clothes ... ... letting their stuff hang out , causing men to lose their mind .
spring is when i have to counsel all my girlfriends ... ... on how to keep their no good , unable to say no men in line .
amazing what a little warm weather can do .
jason , sweetie , clear my schedule for today .
oh , hello , yellow .
that's stunning , girl .
any emergencies , call my cell .
i always will .
nice .
men are so predictable .
hey , girl .
jason knows where to find me .
morning , miss smith .
what is it about men and big booties?
thanks , jose .
like my house?
not bad for a girl from compton .
by the way , i'm shant smith ... ... senior ad executive at parker and long .
and if you haven't noticed , i'm a sister .
an educated , strong sister ... ... who knows where she's from and where she's going .
why can't men act right?
don't they know that ... ... women would gladly give them the respect they needed?
but because they show their asses , we gots to chuck them .
take my girlfriend karen for instance .
she's been staying with me for a few days .
hopeless case .
there's nothing to it if we don't .
forget about invitations .
let's get married tonight !
see what i mean?
are you still in your pjs?
baby , it's 11 : 30 .
i know .
you feeling better?
a little .
good .
how about this?
bam !
chrysanthemums !
your favorite .
you know you're my girl .
i got your back .
what's the matter?
michael used to give me chrysanthemums .
i miss him .
oh , no .
now , come here .
come here .
this really saddens me .
karen's a top executive at a big engineering firm .
michael !
oh , lord jesus .
the youngest executive in the company .
black , white , male , female , she's the youngest .
strong , sharp , very impressive .
one day after lunch , she meets this ... ... scary curl , uncle tom looking , bucktooth brother .
so , can you fix my car?
shit , i can fix anything .
she cut his hair , even straightened out his teeth .
you need anything else fixed up?
she's a down sister .
she'll work with a brother .
mike .
big mike .
big mike?
what's your name?
karen .
yes .
damn , you beautiful .
you make a brother wanna sing to you .
ooh , ooh , ooh , karen
i want you
brother was looking good .
he treated her like a queen .
she gave him everything .
begging her to ....
marry me .
really?
marry me .
really?
really .
marry me .
everything was fine .
peachy keen .
then one day , he saw a mirror .
trouble .
he started thinking , " hey ....
looking kind of good .
come on .
next thing you know he's acting up .
acting like he's running things .
he moved in , the flowers stopped coming .
he started to show his ass .
though he's not cheating ... ... it's been two years , and he hasn't mentioned marriage .
suddenly , he's afraid of commitment ... ... giving her that old line .
i've been hurt , so i'm careful with my heart .
please .
he was broke , with a jheri curl and crooked teeth .
look .
can i get another beer?
yeah .
she's got choices .
you know what i told her to do .
right .
kick him to the curb .
it is time to move on , karen .
time to find a new man , learn how to cook .
i can cook .
you can microwave .
it's time to learn a bit about sports , too .
the way to a man's heart is through stomach and sports .
not your wallet .
all i tried to do was fix him up a little .
i know .
now , no more michael .
eat .
a man is like a stray dog .
you feed a stray dog one day ... ... and if he comes back , you got him hooked .
plus , a man's loving is better on a full stomach .
when's the last time you showered?
tracye's situation is different .
her man?
definitely cheating on her .
a sure sign of that is the constant roaming eyes .
come on .
i'm just looking .
nothing wrong with just looking .
i'm a man , ain't l?
no , you're a dog .
you know what i told her to do?
chuck him .
finally , there's diedre .
ghetto fabulous .
her man , double negative .
he has no job and no money , talking about ....
baby , lend me a c note .
hell no !
come on , baby .
you know i love you , girl .
no !
i'm sick about that shit now .
no !
somebody please tell her what she should do .
that's right .
kick his broke ass to the curb .
miss smith .
how are you?
fine , cynthia .
is keith in his meeting?
i'll let him know that you're here .
thanks .
mr. fenton , miss smith is here to see you .
i will send her in .
he's just finishing .
you can go in .
thanks , cynthia .
is everybody clear what our agenda is?
absolutely .
let's reconvene about 4 : 00?
this is a big deal , let's not leave anything to chance .
me?
i don't have a problem with my man .
he behaves very well .
hey , baby .
damn !
don't be alarmed .
keith's my man .
this ain't none of your business .
i'll be back .
nothing like love in the afternoon .
you may be surprised i just did a little freaky drive by .
but let me explain something .
keith is my man and has been for a while .
it was a typical night out for us .
we were looking good and acting bad .
there were lots of good looking men .
then he looked at me .
and for a second , everyone in the place disappeared .
he was fine .
but there was something else .
that something that makes your head light .
excuse me .
yes .
i'm gonna ask you some questions .
questions?
yeah , questions .
all right .
if i'm right , all answers to these questions will be yes .
you think so?
i think so .
well , let's see .
do you like chocolate?
yes .
do you think i find you attractive?
yeah .
if i were to kiss you right now , would you slap me?
yes .
don't you find me attractive?
you look all right .
i'm all right?
would you like to dance?
yes .
excuse me .
so , you see?
keith is special .
you don't do that for everybody .
just your man .
men want a woman in public and a freak in private .
if you disagree with that , then you don't know .
you better ask somebody .
keith !
what?
what?
what are you doing in here?
open up the window , stuff flew all over my desk .
you opened the window?
you hit it , didn't you?
oh , you's a dog !
i ain't say i hit it .
i don't think i said that .
you got the look in your eyes .
yeah , but i will say this .
there's nothing you can ever say to make me leave that woman of mine .
she do got a fat ass .
did you smack it?
conny spalding .
vice president of marketing and a bona fide ho .
hey , conny !
hey , how you been?
fine .
where you headed?
to see your man .
is he there?
he's there .
let me go holler at that negro .
okay .
bye , sweetie .
bitch .
every girl's got a bit of ho in them , but conny's different .
she's a do whatever it takes to get your man ... ... kind of ho .
i don't know how she got thatjob .
but after she got hired , her boss got a divorce .
you make the call .
i'm here to see keith .
why am i not afraid of her hanging around him?
i trust him .
i'll see him for dinner .
he knows what he's got .
that's my man .
oh , did i mention how accomplished he is?
gotta love that man .
time to see tracye .
it's spring .
she'll be fighting with her man .
who are you messing with?
i won't get mad or yell .
just tell me who you're messing with .
because i know you messing with somebody .
so who's the bitch that you messing with?
what are you talking about?
i only mess with you .
you's a liar .
i ain't lying .
you's a liar .
because you smelled some perfume on me the other day?
i hugged my mother .
her perfume must've got on me .
i know you're lying , dwain .
i know because i found these drawers underneath the couch !
so who do they belong to?
they damn sure ain't mine .
that's right .
sit down and think up a good lie .
i wanna see how you'll get out of this one .
if you're not sure your man is cheating , this is what you do .
plant underwear at his house .
too big or too small , so it's clear they're not yours .
pull them out in front of him and see what he has to say .
tracye , that's your problem .
you're too jealous .
who do the underwear belong to? !
i'll tell you .
go ahead and tell me !
relax , okay?
the underwear belong to ... ... my sister .
your sister .
her machine broke .
she came to wash her clothes ... ... and left them over here .
matter of fact , she called me about them .
let me see .
with the glitter .
that's them .
that's them?
you sure?
yeah .
what?
liar !
i'm sick of your lying ass !
you ain't nothing but a liar !
damn , they're loud .
good lord .
why must black people cause ruckus in a white man's building?
i hate that i had to say that .
but admit it , minorities do seem to get louder than white folks .
stupid ass motherfucker !
stop yelling !
shit !
people are outside .
i'm so sick of your lying ass !
how you gonna talk about your sister ....
where you been today?
tracye?
stop .
i ain't playing with you .
i ain't playing either !
bitch .
excuse us .
get ahold of that .
relax .
let me ask you .
why do men let women come over their house and break shit?
that don't make sense .
when you do your dirt , go over her house ... ... so when she gets mad , she can bust up all of her shit .
that's it .
i'm through with you .
it's over .
i'm going home .
let's go .
i'm sick of you anyway .
i'm sick of you !
just get out .
don't you tell me what to do .
where you going?
get back in here .
son of a bitch !
tracye?
my mother bought me that vase .
i'll catch you later .
okay?
i'm coming .
i just got some shit i got to handle .
now we can go .
no , you gonna pay for that .
i ain't paying for shit .
i bet you'll pay for that .
i won't .
lord have mercy .
you're gonna pay .
i ain't paying .
i'll take the jacket .
give it back .
you gonna take it?
stop .
before a man cheats on you , there are signs .
i was working late .
what's wrong with a brother buying some new underwear?
i mean , yeah , i wear fruit of the looms , but ... ...
i wanna try calvin kleins .
i was working late .
my ring?
it's right here .
it was itching my finger .
i was working .
i know i ain't worked out in years .
but i'm trying to get back into shape for you .
i was working late .
that's right .
i was working late .
there you go .
ready to go , shant?
i can't .
i gotta do dinner with keith .

they did set you back a bit .
i don't know what you saw in him .
get out of here !
that's what she saw .
has to do it every time .
and was sprung .
okay?
sprung .
the brother knows how to handle his business .
that's important .
i can testify to that .
i'll tell you , tyrone may be broke ... ... and have a mouthful of gold , but he's a pipe laying fool .
my baby can lay the pipe !
shant , what about keith with his fine self?
he's a professional man too .
yummy .

baby got big feet .
i'm sorry for noticing his feet .
he can hang a suit too .

shake that ass .
shant?
that was keith .
he said he can't do dinner .
he's working late .
work it out .
he's working late?
i don't know why we had to come here .
shant likes to clear her head here .
how do you know everything she says is true?
because nobody knows more about men than shant .
she's right .
sorry , ladies .
tell miss thing who has the 411 on the fellas?
i don't wanna toot my own horn , but beep .
she didn't say yes .

rule no .

hey , keith .
i thought that was you .

shant , look , this is

yes , it sure is .
girl , cute outfit .
nice to see you , keith .

she was nice .
who's she?
don't cause a scene .
don't go off .
less is always best .
right now he doesn't know what to think .
let's get our stuff and go .
we haven't eaten yet .
the food's not good .
what did you say?
he's leaving .
i said hey .
why do men do that shit?
i'll slap him and that little ho he was with .
she's not a ho .
she's a hooker .
she works with him .
they had a drink .
you allow him to go out?
you have to have trust .
exactly .
i have reached a new level of respect for you .
see what i mean?
my girl got skills .
i see .
so i lied .
like you ain't never lied to your friends before .
rule no .
never let your girlfriends know the whole situation .
they'll give you bad advice and ruin your confidence .
and confidence is key .
ready to order?
i'll have spaghetti parmesan ... ... with olives , basil and sun dried tomatoes .
when you're in a spot , your friends are watching .
show no emotion .
if you panic , your girlfriends will panic .
anything to drink?
a martini .
shaken not stirred .
smith .
shant smith .
nothing happened .
i was hungry .
she asked me join her .
that's it .
nonsense , keith .
that's the truth .
you took this woman to a club and didn't want a hit?
correction , she invited me .
i didn't wanna hit .
semantics , dog .
that is shant's favorite spot .
how would i take a girl i wanna hit to her spot?
hold on one second , dog .
ladies and gentlemen of the jury , i intend to prove ... ... that keith fenton has perjured himself in the court of law .
brother , sit down .
may i approach the witness , your honor?
may i treat the witness as a hostile witness?
thank you .
keith , i'm a tad bit confused .
maybe you can help me understand .
you took this 26 year old , supple breasted ... ... tight assed , skin so smooth it look like buttermilk ... ... to a secluded restaurant and danced with that .
then when you got caught , you acted guilty !
why?
you wanted to hit it .
no .
you wanted to hit it .
i did not wanna hit it .
you wanted to bend it up in her , to tap that ass !
down in your loins !
all right .
you lusted for her !
okay !
maybe a bit i lusted for her .
she fine .
good , now we getting somewhere .
see , keith , you're guilty , dog .
guilty ... ... of lust .
all right?
okay .
you wanted to hit it .
whatever you say .
what do we do right now?
we wait .
this boy's just ignorant .
who's taking me home?
i got you .
you don't give no gas money .
shut up !
it's true .
see you guys later .
all right .
y'all be careful .
okay .
the girls are gone .
now it's time to implement the 10 day program .
now pay attention , it's gonna go fast .
check your answering machine .
if he hasn't called yet ... ... he just hasn't figured out an approach .
cardinal rule no .
do not call him .
whoever calls first loses ground .
she hasn't called .
how come she ain't calling?
she's playing it cool .
how can she play cool at this time?
look here , dog .
she calls , she gives you the upper hand .
she don't want that .
go on .
make the call .
no , then i'll lose ground .
you won't .
technically you're the one that messed up .
the person who messes up calls first .
that's the rules .
you can call today or be a player and call tomorrow .
that way she's had time to calm down .
right .
and then when i do call ... ... she'll know i know i was wrong .
and that i cared enough to be that vulnerable .
your right , women love that shit .
vulnerability's the big dick of emotions .
they like the big dick .
they do .
he didn't call tonight .
i didn't think it would happen this way .
or that my life'd be the example for today's lesson .
anyways ... ... y'all ready?
here it goes .
day one .
he'll call , unless he's a fool .
if he is , you don't want him .
if he's a good man , you'll get a call .
miss smith's office .
oh , hi , mr. fenton .
can you hold on?
i'll see if she is available .
guess what?
miss smith , i have keith on line one .
never take the first call .
everything must be done on your time .
make him wait .
tell him i just got out of a meeting and to call back in 10 minutes .
she told me to call back .
don't even worry about that .
she stalling for time .
she disheveled .
she don't know what to do .
okay , 10 minutes .
play the game with her , you know?
does the back of my neck look like this?
it's now nine minutes .
if he's late , be in another meeting .
miss smith , keith on line one .
hello?
fine .
discuss nothing over the phone .
be brief .
your job is to just listen .
now , remember , dog .
don't rush in .
take your time .
i got this , bro .
so , how's your day been so far?
fine .
if he takes time to feel you out , rush him .
so how's that new  i got a client coming .
why don't we meet tonight at the bistro?
okay , but  the client's coming in .
tonight , 7 : 30 , the bistro .
no , wait , hold on .
i just
she rushed me off the phone .
she rushed me off the phone .
you know what?
i think she did that deliberately .
did she set a date?
how'd you know?
that's the mack move .
that's definitely the mack move .
that lets me know one thing .
what?
she ain't no amateur .
yeah , well , neither am l .
thank you .
sure .
arrive 15 minutes late .
keep him waiting .
waiting builds anxiety , and that's a good thing .
your objective is to listen .
be polite and charming .
this confuses them .
hey , keith .
hey .
calm down , man .
look , let me ask you something first .
was she talking a lot?
if she was , she's covering .
no , she didn't .
she was talking , right?
yeah .
she seemed normal .
if that's talking , yes .
she seemed normal?
yeah , she did .
she got an angle .
admit you're wrong .
let's see what she's got .
you sure?
have i steered you wrong?
yeah .
one time , but you got your hair back .
all right , shant , i was wrong .
i shouldn't have been with julie .
but we were working late , i got hungry ... ... she asked me if i wanted to go eat , and i was ....
it doesn't matter what his ass says .
he should've known better .
but now that he's offered some form of an explanation ... ... you step to the plate , girl .
be a woman .
do the right thing .
gut punch that ass .
after two drinks we were dancing , and that's when you came in .
keith , it's okay .
you don't need to explain .
i understand .
cool .
all right .
good .
you know what?
i think we need some time apart .
see what else is out there .
test the waters .
test the waters "? !
what the hell?
keith , calm down , bro .
i am calm !
you getting swollen up in the chest .
sit down , relax .
test the waters?
i don't want you to feel restricted .
restricted?
and lately , i've been feeling a little trapped myself , so ... ... maybe it's the best thing .
is that cool with you?
yeah , i was gonna suggest the same thing .
cool .
good .
waiter , check , please .
would you like me to take care of this?
no , i'll pick this one up .
are you sure?
i'm sure .
thanks for dinner .
yeah .
rule no .
break up with him before he breaks up with you .
whoever breaks up with the person first wins .
she broke up with me !
see , that's interesting .
she sat there and let me humiliate myself ... ... by making me go through how sorry i was .
then she broke up with me .
i should've made her pay .
she offered to pay?
why?
she's good .
because she picked up a check?
no , it's about a psychological advantage .
but i paid , bro .
but she offered .
she has before .
but never after breaking up .
look , in order to grasp this , you got to think like them ... ... to read between the lines .
you got to ask yourself , " when she offered to pay ... ... did she want to come up out of the pocket? " think about it .
on a date , what woman wants to pay for the meal?
none !
zero .
i'm 29 years old .
i haven't met a woman who does .
so you can safely conclude this is not about the money .
so what is this about?
she wants you to know she could come out of pocket if she wanted to .
this is a demonstration of her independence to you .
she's trying to tell you that you can't do nothing for her .
you can't even buy her damn dinner !
she'd starve before you come out the pocket .
that's deep .
that's some really deep shit right there .
now we know his crime .
he went out to dinner with a coworker ... ... after working late ... ... had dinner , did a little dancing , got caught ... ... and now he feels bad .
actually , that's not too bad .
however ... ... if your case is worse , determine if you want your man back .
if you don't , to hell with him .
keep on stepping .
but if you want him back , punish him .
cardinal rule no .
when your man messes up , no matter how small it is ... ... you gots to punish him .
punish him hard .
day two .
what you all think?
prommy .
yeah , too prommy .
no , too prommy .
hated it .
yeah .
all right , okay .
what we thinking?
better .
you need something with a little green .
like a money green .
and spandex .
karen !
she know i'm playing with her .
stop it .
all right .
what about this one?
better .
what?
now , see , this is a size 12 .
why did you bring me in this skinny ass store?
what you gonna do?
you see that there?
i'll sew them together , and pack all this up in there .
this the front , this the back .
work it .
i'm big , beautiful and loving it .
day two and three for you are a breeze .
for him , it's hell .
keith !
are you watching the game?
when i show you the truth ....
if i stay out late saturday , i attend church via tv sunday morning .
i keep up with my religion .
what up?
this is shant .
at the beep , do your thing .
this is keith .
i called you yesterday .
you didn't return my call .
if you're there , pick up .
if you're there , pick up .
cool .
call me when you get in .
in love and war , maintain military silence .
don't speak or consort with the enemy .
silence is golden .
you can do more with silence than speaking .
what up?
this is shant .
at the beep , do your thing .
i'm picking up some tickets to the lauryn hill concert .
so just let me know if you wanna go .
see?
he think he's slick .
you know i love lauryn hill .
that's okay .
i'm going to church anyway .
like mama said , better to get there late than not at all .
lauryn hill .
no , you didn't .
no , i can't call .
i'm not gonna call .
called twice already .
can't be desperate .
okay .
oh , no .
okay , all right .
no .
it's you , man .
who else are you expecting , dog?
come on , you're not even ready .
i forgot i had these briefs to prepare , so i can't make it today .
you're not thinking about shant?
come on , man .
no , man .
i'm not thinking about that girl .
all right .
i see you later , man .
tell them i'm sorry i couldn't make it .
i'm about to be tiger woods .
he's still playing it cool .
he's upset , but he has things under control .
his ego won't let him go far .
so what do you do?
you break him .
push his buttons .
to do this , you need a pr agent and a flunky .
okay , who's the pr agent , and who's the flunky?
hey , trent .

your pr agent should be watching you .
he must be a friend of your man's .

i know what a christian hug is .
when girls give you a little hug with their asses out ... ... so you got that space in case you get a little excited .
you don't want them to feel your man man in church .

day four .
the buying power of african americans is up 12 percent in groceries .
the buying power of african americans is up 12 percent in groceries .
it's tapering off in alcohol largely due to special interest groups .
i think we can improve if we limit our marketing ... ... and focus on after school projects ... ... thereby helping the community .
people will see us still targeting african americans ... ... and providing a community service .
so we're redirecting our energies .
exactly , bill .
we're turning it into a positive relationship .
that's very good .
thanks .
well done .

i did exactly what you said .
exactly what you told me .
damn .
i got over there about 10 : 00 ... ... all dressed up , looking good and suave and ... ... debonair .
like denzel?
better than denzel .
shit , let me sit down then .
come in .
so she invited me in .
walked in there all calm , cool and collected .
started to dim the lights all over .
got some soft music playing .
she knew i was there to make a move .
sat down on the couch , looking good like ... ... chocolate hagen dazs ice cream .
with the nuts .
with the nuts .
looking all luscious and lickety .
i was there to seduce .
gave her that denzel eye thing ... ... then a little l. l. lip action .
it was about to be on !
so , did you hit?
relax , relax .
no , did you hit?
relax , all right?
come on .
you hit it , right?
started moving in for the kill .
and then?
she too smart for that .
told you that .
but ... ... plan b.
so you had plan b?
started an argument .
didn't matter about what .
i got her yelling at me .
i drew her into me emotionally .
after it was over , i just ...
...
i felt so good , like jogging .
see , that's it .
the transfer of frustration from one party to the next .
you right about that .
of course .
you take physics?
yeah .
what's the law of thermodynamic energy by newton?
energy is neither lost nor destroyed .
i remember .
it is transferred from one party to the next .
right .
we all experience it .
feeling good?
feeling real good now .
somebody full of negative energy ... ... leaves you feeling completely drained .
sucks it out of you .
transference of energy .
that's what you did .
you transferred your negative energy and emotions onto her .
you flipped the script .
was i flipping it?
you flipped it .
women , they emotional creatures .
preach .
once you tap into their emotions , you're halfway there .
testify !
it doesn't matter what type of emotion .
i'll beat a drum .
once those emotional floodgates are open ...
... you're home free .
home free !
they get confused .
confused .
bewildered .
bewildered !
lethargic .
lethargic !
amen , amen !
amen , baby !
yeah , amen !
hallelujah !
hallelujah !
will somebody please cut that damn music?
day five is a bad day .
that's all i gotta say .
day six is a bad day , but not as bad as five .
so he turned the tables on you with the transfer of emotion shit .
i ain't gonna lie .
that shit does work .
so now you got to turn the tables back on him .
but until you do that , what must you do?
occupy your damn time .
stay busy .
y'all know what i mean .
so in times like these , this is what i do , ladies .
i break out the old black book .
while you're thinking about him ... ... he's having a good time not thinking about you .
tyrone .
call tyrone .
come down low .
put it in my face .
i want it to be funky .
how you doing?
you were right , man .
i feel like my old self again .
told you .
you didn't know a big man could move like this .
how do you like that?
what's going on?
spin it around on me , baby .
spin it .
you my own little spinning top .
what going on?
i'm enjoying myself .
i see you .
you see me?
what's going on down there?
turn around .
i'm glad you made it to my promotion .
it's nice to mix business with pleasure .
that's the nipple .
i know .
business with pleasure .
always like the pleasure of business .
i hear it .
at events like this , it's nice to have your lawyer ... ... close to you .
i'm a little tired .
i'm gonna go rest .
tony , can i see you?
ln a minute , baby .
bring your ass over here .
i'll be right back .
what's up , dog?
she's trying to rape me .
you say that like that's a bad thing .
look at that .
look at her .
she is fine .
i know she's fine , man .
but putting her titties on my back , grabbing my stuff ...?
do you know how much i'd pay to have her grab my stuff?
plus , dog , if she was ugly ... ...
i would've told you to step off .
but look at that .
dog , she bad !
look at them titties .
nice , big old breastices .
they're just wanting you to suck on them .
they're staring .
that small waist leading down to that plump ass .
she shaking that ass for you , saying , " keith , come eat me .
put it on your chin .
plus , she got a good job , and on top of that , she a freak .
you can hit that from the back .
oh , shit .
look at her .
what more do you want , man?
i don't know , man .
i don't know .
if you want to completely get over shant ... ... you have to date other people .
why not start with that?
i'm gonna go smack ass .
i suggest you let her smack your ass .
shant , i really thought you forgot about me .
i'm glad you called .
day six is a real drag .
what the hell am i doing here?
stick through it .
go on many dates .
it's all part of the 10 day process .
i thought you weren't concerned about me .
i thought ...
... you avoided me .
but now i know you can't ...
... do without big papa .
ray ray .
your pooh bear .
day seven .
i got an announcement .
what , baby?
i finished my 10 day program .
oh , lord .
bam !
it works !
michael proposed , guys !
i'm so happy for you .
congratulations !
you worked it out .
it's not that i'm not happy for her .
i've got my own problems .
you can't be happy until you get your stuff together .
so on day seven there are a few things you must do .
pay a visit to victoria's secret .
get your nails and hair done .
take a long , hot bubble bath .
pull out that dress that hugs and accentuates your curves .
all women are beautiful and have something that works .
oh , and don't forget about these .
there'll be no pantylines tonight .
you take an unannounced trip to your man's house .
without trust you don't have anything .
your objective is to get in the house .
make up some excuse to bait him .
keith .
hey .
here's the rest of your stuff .
i've had it in my car and wanted to drop it off .
i'm sorry it's so late .
i just needed some closure .
wanna come in so we can talk?
that's not a good idea .
i won't hurt you .
i mean , just a second .
i'm gonna go .
shant .
just for a second , all right?
just please .
got him .
before you know it , you'll be with him on the couch .
allow him to caress your soft body and kiss you .
do not resist when his strong hands grab your ample behind ... ... and squeeze tight .
anything to get him where he has to have you .
then make up an excuse and leave .
i gotta go .
really .
i gotta go .
i gotta go .
no .
hell , no .
i'm sorry , i didn't mean to lead you on .
i'm not ready for this .
shant !
shant !
oh , shit .
and that's day seven .
you've turned the tables .
never let a woman come over your house unannounced , dog .
and if you not sure you'll hit it , don't start nothing .
everybody know that if a woman let you hit it , and you hit it ... ... you got the power .
but if you start , and she says no , then she got the power .
power .
power?
it's about power?
you set us back .
she flipped the script .
i don't care about this " flipping the script .
i'll call her , have a conversation , start making up .
no , no , no , dog .
you can't call her .
this is getting personal now .
she beginning to piss me off .
piss you off?
this is not about a mental game between you and her .
it's about my relationship , my life .
will you stop thinking about yourself for once?
you think this is about you .
oh , no , this stopped being about you a long time ago .
you're doing this for all men in the country .
you're doing this for men around the world .
around the world?
you tripping .
bro ... ... if you fail now ... ... every woman will think they can pull this trick .
you know how woman talk .
how?
women are gonna be pulling these head trips .
we'll be the ones cooking dinner .
we'll be the ones changing the diapers , washing the dishes .
you know what they'll do?
sit on our couch watching football .
that's what's gonna happen .
this is much bigger than you .
way bigger than you .
you make it sound like women are like the cla .
that's funny , though .
funny .
the cla ... ... ain't got shit on a woman with a plan .
remember that .
a turning point was actually on day seven .
i went over to his house , turned him on , then left .
left him in the bed with a hard on .
you left your man with a hard on?
dick was hard as a rock .
just
damn , i don't know if i could've did that .
see , i love dick far too much to let a hard one go to waste .
see , you don't do it all the time .
i have a policy .
as many times as he can get it up , you get it back down .
girl , can i keep it real?
teach .
but there is a " but .
when your man's been bad , you give him two options .
blue balls or choke that chicken .
she know .
she know .
crab cakes were a hit .
crab cakes were , weren't they?
i gotta say this .
hold up .
showing up unannounced is a risk .
true .
what if his boys were there?
or another girl?
you want me to handle it?
come on , shant , jr .
all right .
you must know your man's cycle .
all men have a sex cycle .
most men need to have sex at least once every seven days .
what man she fucking?
my man is 2 , 3 , 4 times a day .
so if his boys are over there and you looking fine ... ... he'll tell them to leave because he'll wanna get busy .
but you've got to get him the day before ... ... he thinks about another girl .
and if he's a good man , hello ... ... he'll wait a week before seeing somebody else .
right?
right .
how did i do?
my car .
i gotta run a few errands before work .
see you later .
call me .
a week?
what kind
i'm talking about maybe a day or two .
your man is weak .
he's a punk .
on day eight , stock up on groceries .
pick out a bottle of wine .
once you make up with your man ... ... you may be inside for a few days .
listen up , everyone .
new development .
our competitor is launching new events for their clients .
last wednesday they had a hump day for coca cola .
this weekend , a pool party for miller genuine draft .
normally i don't impose weekend work , but i think this is an exception .
don't you?
this is the break that we needed .
conny invited you as her escort , right?
go .
no , go .
this will be your chance to shine , your chance to emerge ... ... as the true player you really are .
no , i don't like playing games , man .
i don't ....
can i ask you something?
has shant even called you today?
no .
" just calling to see if you alive . " no .
you think she's moping after she walked out on you?
what are you waiting for?
i don't know .
pick up this phone , call conny .
call her .
tell her you wanna go to that party .
because shant , she half stepping .
and you got other options .
it's time for a man to do what a man's got to do .
stop pining over this woman .
show her who's the man !
show her who's wearing the big drawers .
you right .
i've been pining over her for too long .
i need get back to being the player .
play on .
i need to break out my old mack moves and show her who she dealing with .
time to show her who wears the drawers .
oh , suki suki now .
call her .
what?

this is lala .
we're partying at the miller draft extravaganza .
how you ladies doing?
hey !
oh , my god , this is so nice .
thanks for inviting us .
looks like it may be worth my while .
please be on your best behavior .
my boss is here .
we won't embarrass you .
i didn't mean that .
this is work .
gotta check out the competition .
let's get some drinks .
free drinks .
come on .
that's right , y'all .
here we go now .
this extravaganza thing is quite a success .
it's not a bad tool .
we should've thought of it .
meet the representative of the man who did .
miss spalding , how are you?
bill parker .
how are you?
hi , shant .
tell jim i send my congratulations on this success .
will do .
oh , no , he didn't .
he didn't just walk in and act like he doesn't know me .
this is wrong .
on day nine , you're supposed to be kicking back ... ... waiting for him to beg for forgiveness .
i didn't know you knew conny spalding .
she's lovely .
she reminds me of you .
she does .
bill , could you excuse me for a second?
sure .
thank you .
thank you .
enjoy .
so , can't speak?
what's happening?
what's happening?
what are you doing here with conny?
i hadn't heard from you , so i took matters into my own hands .
you said test the waters .
let's just say brother's swimming tonight .
so you showed up with her knowing that i would be here?
i didn't know you'd be here .
the truth is , i'm tired of your bullshit .
i'm a good man .
it's time for me to explore my options .
keith , hon , let's dance .
option no .
1 .
hon "?
conny , may i speak to you for a second?
sure .
thanks .
what are you doing?
what do you mean?
what are you doing with keith?
he's my man .
he's not acting like your man .
he would if didn't have a little hooch running behind him .
i don't appreciate that .
why are you calling me names?
it's a little junior high .
keith is here because he wants to be .
i didn't force him .
it's his decision , so ... ... don't take your man frustrations out on me .
okay?
no , she didn't .
no , this trick ass bitch did not just go there .
but you know what?
she's right .
when your man messes up , deal with him , not the woman .
there's nothing worse than two women fighting over a man .
not ladylike .
but you know what?
i don't like this bitch .
that's what i'm talking about .
work it out .
okay , i admit .
that's not how you handle it .
back it up .
this is how you really handle it .
keith is here because he wants to be .
i didn't force him .
it's his decision , so ... ... don't take your man frustrations out on me .
okay?
get it together .
we need you over here .
i'll be right there .
come here for a minute .
can you keep him occupied till i get back?
how you ladies doing?
fine .
tony?
yeah?
give me a hand with this .
yeah .
these are miller girls .
my man , tony .
which one you want?
give me snowflake .
then i'm frosty .
snowflake , don't get too close .
you might melt .
because it's hot !
why didn't you tell us you were having problems?
you let him act a fool in front of you like that?
yo , keith .
spotlight's on you , dog .
she looking?
check it out .
you want me to handle this?
breaking it down .
i'm breaking her down?
want me to handle this for you?
i'd just break down and cry .
you want me to yank his ass?
i don't care .
i'll straight yank his ass .
you want me to?
what are you gonna do?
what you doing , bitch?
see why you don't tell your girlfriends?
they'll heighten the situation by panicking , and you will too .
you want me to yank his ass?
no , diedre .
it's okay .
i will pull jack moves on that fool .
i done fought fools way bigger .
no , diedre , it's okay .
i'll handle it .
i got the situation under control .
he's just venting now .
let him have his fun .
no , we'll have none of that .
no !
they don't know diedre fear .
once again , if you don't want your man back ... ... to hell with him .
keep on stepping .
but if you want him back and behaved ... ... you must do some strange things .
excuse me , ladies .
i'll be right back .
pay attention , this'll go fast .
one : lntensify your game by finding a man .
a fine one .
but you need to recruit him quickly .
where is it?
oh , right here .
great .
desperate times call for desperate measures .
yes .
the old damsel in distress trick .
works every time .
need some help?
no , i'm fine .
thank you .
not cute enough .
hey , need some help?
no , my boyfriend should be coming any second .
okay .
not smooth enough .
everything all right?
that's our man .
i've seem to have gotten a flat tire .
that's easy .
do you have a spare?
that little old thing in the back?
it is?
i got one of those .
all right .
let me pull over .
yes .
after you've recruited your man , get him a drink .
yeah , she got him a drink .
don't worry about that , dog .
you just do your thing .
she wanna play hardball , huh?
i'm about to turn up the heat up in here .
hey , hey , baby .
would you like to dance?
i'd love to .
take off , man .
that's a sexy style you got .
don't worry about him .
he's like a child , begging for attention . lgnore him .
that little performance over there is just to get your attention .
doesn't matter what he's doing .
direct your attention to him .
doesn't matter what he says .
be attentive .
laugh at his jokes .
act like you are having a ball .
i said , " who do you think i am?
jim carrey?
so sexy the way you did that .
i'll set it off in here if they don't bring me some wings .
well , what is this?
oh , no .
that's white people shit .
we need some meat .
hey , man .
all right , sweetie .
she hasn't moved .
you're in trouble .
why?
lf she was dancing , that'd be fine .
you can dance with anybody .
but she's talking to him .
that's personal .
she trying to get to know him .
raise the stakes by going to a quiet corner .
would you like to go inside?
sure .
great .
where did they go?
she went in the house .
ln the house?
with the old boy .
no , man .
you are so funny .
can i talk to you for a minute , please?
sure .
would you excuse me , calvin?
sure .
i'll go get us drinks .
yeah , get drinks .
what's with talking to him?
trying to make me jealous?
i am not .
i want to talk to him .
i'm not into playing games .
you're not?
you are the queen of games .
you play more games than the damn nba .
he is mad at you .
it's getting hot .
time for the coup de gras .
that's the french term for " fuck him up .
keith , i gotta go .
oh , no .
hold on .
what's this for?
no reason .
what do you mean?
i'm carrying it just in case .
just in case what?
i know she'll sleep with him .
everybody has condoms nowadays .
why does she have it in her purse?
decoration .
she won't use it .
she sleep with you on the first date?
yes .
it's a lot , but if you do this right , you'll never have to again .
so stick it out .
you know what?
we need to talk .
excuse me , calvin .
you're not leaving .
don't control me .
i just don't want you to go .
this isn't about that .
you don't care about me or you wouldn't been getting your groove on .
and to add insult to injury , you're here with conny .
so excuse me .
i'm leaving .
shant .
keith , i want to go .
if you walk out that door with him ...
...
i'm going home with conny .
if you feel you have to control me by going home with conny ... ... go right ahead .
do what you gotta do .
but no matter what you decide , i'm walking out that door .
gotta go .
you're taking a gamble .
he might sleep with conny .
but my guess is he won't .
he'll be at your house , waiting before you get there .
so take your time .
well , good night , calvin .
sure you don't want me to come up?
i'm tired .
but thanks for following me home .
no problem .
take care .
okay , this is it .
prepare for a night of heat .
when you open the door , your man should ... ... be waiting on the couch for you .
with flowers .
keith?
keith?
keith?
keith?
hello , this miller residence?
food delivery .
miller residence .
no , next door .
oh , next door .
next door , okay .
i know what you're thinking .
the shit didn't work , right?
well , maybe you're right .
i just thought that you followed certain rules ... ... when a brother messes up to get him back .
but i guess i didn't consider that ... ... when it comes to love there are no rules .
hook me up a martini .
what's up , girl?
not a damn thing , girl .
this place is so tired .
i was just putting the moves on this fine ass man .
