see you tomorrow .
oh , my god !
i'm in .
we're almost there .
sir , are you sure about this?
i told you , we're going to be all right .
i understand , sir .
it's just that i'm scoping some serious sentinel activity up here .
link .
yes , sir?
given your situation , i can't say i understand your reasons ... ... for volunteering to operate onboard my ship .
however , if you wish to continue to do so , i must ask you to do one thing .
what's that , sir?
to trust me .
yes , sir .
i will , sir .
i mean , i do , sir .
i hope so .
repatch the main ac to the hard drives and stand by to broadcast .
yes , sir .
still can't sleep?
you wanna talk?
they're just dreams .
if you're afraid of something ....
i just wish ....
i wish i knew what i'm supposed to do .
that's all .
i just wish i knew .
she's gonna call .
don't worry .
here you are .
are we ready to go?
we're already late .
these geotherms confirm the last transmission of the osiris .
the machines are digging .
they're boring from the surface down to zion .
mother  they'll avoid the perimeter defense .
how fast are they moving?
control estimates their descent at 100 meters an hour .
how deep are they?
almost 2000 meters .
what about the scans from the osiris?
they can't be accurate .
they may be .
it's not possible .
that'd mean there are a quarter million sentinels .
that's right .
that can't be .
why not?
a sentinel for every man , woman and child in zion .
that sounds exactly like the thinking of a machine to me .
morpheus , glad you could join us .
niobe .
my apologies to all .
but as you are undoubtedly aware ... ... it's become difficult to locate a secure broadcast position .
squiddies got our best spots .
lines are crawling with them .
and if niobe's right , in 72 hours there's gonna be a quarter million more .
what are we gonna do?
we're gonna do what commander lock ordered .
we'll evacuate broadcast level and return to zion .
and does the commander have a plan for stopping 250, 000 sentinels?
a strategy is still being formulated .
i'm sure it is .
what do you think we should do , morpheus?
we should proceed as ordered ...
what is it?
i don't know . ... however , i must ask one of you for help .
some of you believe as i believe , some of you do not .
those of you that do ... ... know we are nearing the end of our struggle .
the prophecy will be fulfilled soon .
but before it can be ... ... the oracle must be consulted .
if we return and recharge now ... ... we can be back in 36 hours , well before the machines reach this depth .
do you understand what you're asking?
i am asking that one ship remain here in our place ... ... in case the oracle should attempt to contact us .
bullshit .
you're asking one of us to disobey a direct order .
that's right , i am .
but we well know that the reason most of us are here ... ... is because of our affinity for disobedience .
what happens when you get back to zion ... ... and the commander throws you in the stockade?
he won't .
goddamn it , morpheus , you ain't never gonna change .
shit , i'll do it just to see what deadbolt does to you .
you got 36 hours .
i'm looking for neo .
never heard of him .
i have something for him .
a gift .
you see , he set me free .
fine , whatever .
now piss off .
who was that?
how did you know someone was here?
he gave you this .
he said you set him free .
is everything all right , sir?
the meeting is over .
retreat to your exits .
agents are coming .
agents?
go .
hiya , fellas .
it's him .
the anomaly .
do we proceed?
yes .
he is still  only human .
upgrades .
that went as expected .
yes .
it's happening exactly as before .
well , not exactly .
what happened?
i can't figure it out .
agents just came out of nowhere .
then the code got all weird .
encryption i've never seen .
ls neo okay?
okay?
shit , you should've seen him .
where is he now?
he's doing his superman thing .
where are you?
this is the nebuchadnezzar , requesting access through gate three .
nebuchadnezzar , this is zion control .
maintain present velocity and stand by .
roger that , control .
this is control requesting immediate stand down of arms at gate three .
we have the nebuchadnezzar on approach .
let's open her up .
you are cleared through gate three to bay seven .
roger that , control .
door's open , bed's made .
welcome home .
no place like it .
roger that , control .
zion control , stand by for gate three lockdown .
the nebuchadnezzar is down .
bay seven .
understood .
captain mifune .
captain morpheus .
are you here to escort me to the stockade , captain?
i'm just here to keep the peace .
commander lock demands
requests your immediate counsel , sir .
link .
sir?
i want the ship ready to go as soon as possible .
understood , sir .
what is it between them?
morpheus and lock?
niobe .
captain niobe?
she used to be with morpheus .
now she's with lock .
what happened?
morpheus went to the oracle .
after that , everything changed .
yeah , she can do that .
neo !
oh , no .
how does he always know?
doesn't he have anything better to do?
you know what they say about the life you save .
i didn't save his life .
hiya , neo .
trinity , link .
hey .
it's great to have you back .
thanks .
it's good to be back .
can i carry that for you?
no , i can carry my own bag .
trinity?
i'm fine .
you can carry these .
yeah , sure , link .
hey , you know , next year i'm old enough to join a crew , right?
i've been thinking about it , and i've made my decision .
let me guess .
i want to join the nebuchadnezzar .
morpheus hasn't filled the other positions , except for you , link .
i'm sure he has reasons ... ... but the more i think about it , the more i think it's meant to be .
you know , it's fate .
you're the reason i'm here , neo .
i told you , you found me .
i didn't find you .
i know , but you got me out .
you saved me .
you saved yourself .
morpheus .
commander lock .
i spoke to the other captains .
i wanted to offer you a chance to explain your actions .
i wasn't aware that my actions required any explanation .
you were given an order to return to zion .
i did .
you asked for one ship to remain behind .
i would have stayed , but i needed to recharge my ship .
so you admit to a direct contravention of your duty .
we need a presence inside the matrix to await contact from the oracle .
i don't want to hear that shit !
i don't care about oracles or prophecies or messiahs !
stopping that army from destroying this city .
to do that i need soldiers to obey my orders .
with all due respect , commander , there is only one way to save our city .
how?
neo .
goddamn it , morpheus .
not everyone believes what you believe .
my beliefs do not require them to .
there's a gathering tonight .
everyone's talking .
a lot of people are scared .
no one remembers the last time so many ships were docked .
something big is happening , isn't it?
hey .
we're not allowed to say anything , so stop asking .
goddamn , it's good to be home .
i'm recommending that you be removed from duty .
that is , of course , your prerogative , commander .
if it were up to me , you wouldn't set foot on a ship for the rest of your life .
then i am grateful that it is not up to you .
councillor hamann .
commander .
captain .
councillor .
council's asked me to speak tonight at the temple gathering .
the presence of the fleet and the persistence of rumors must be addressed .
the people must be told what is happening .
of course , councillor .
but might i advise a level of discretion concerning specific details .
we do not wish to start a panic .
quite right .
a panic is not what anyone wants .
what about you , captain?
what would you advise?
the truth .
no one will panic , because there is nothing to fear .
that army won't reach the gates of zion .
what makes you so sure?
consider what we have seen , councillor .
consider that in the past six months ... ... we have freed more minds than in six years .
this attack is an act of desperation .
i believe very soon the prophecy will be fulfilled and this war will end .
i hope you're right , captain .
i do not believe it to be a matter of hope , councillor .
it is simply a matter of time .
my stop .
see you soon .
hopefully not too soon .
let's go , kid .
these two got things to do .
are you thinking what i'm thinking?
i am if you're thinking this elevator is too slow .
how long do we charge the neb?
twenty four , maybe 30 hours .
some people go their entire lives without hearing news that good .
neo , please , i have a son , jacob , aboard the gnosis .
please , watch over him .
i'll try .
i have a daughter on the icarus .
no , wait .
it's all right .
they need you .
i need you .
i know .
there's time .
where's my puss?
hey !
uncle link !
god !
uncle link !
oh , my god !
you're so huge !
you should be picking me up !
no !
yeah !
okay !
okay?
all right .
now , we're gonna have to work together here , okay?
one , two , three , lift !
oh , my god !
what are you feeding these two?
come on , kids .
it's time to go .
hey , cas .
hey .
good to have you home , link .
good to be home .
you be careful with her .
don't worry about me .
he's the one that's gonna get it .
out the door !
both of you , march !
bye !
bye !
i'm gonna get what?
every ship up there's been home two , even three times more than the nebuchadnezzar .
come on , zee .
i thought we were past this .
we'll be when you operate another ship .
i can't do that .
why?
you know why .
if dozer knew how i felt , he wouldn't have asked you to do this .
maybe .
but it's too late now .
i made a promise , and some promises can't be unmade .
it's not fair .
nobody said it was gonna be .
you think cas thinks it's fair that i'm here and dozer's not?
i lost two brothers to that ship , link .
i'm afraid of it .
i'm afraid it's gonna take you too .
it won't .
how can you say that to me?
because of morpheus .
because of what he's told me .
he said that this is it , that it will be over soon .
link , morpheus is crazy .
no doubt .
but tank and dozer believed him .
and i'll tell you what ... ... after being on that ship and seeing neo do the things he can do , i gotta say ... ... l'm starting to believe him too .
be careful , link .
please be careful .
they started yet?
only councillor hamann's opening prayer .
tonight , let us honor these men and women .
these are our soldiers , our warriors .
these are our husbands and wives , our brothers and sisters ... ... our children .
let us remember those that have been lost ... ... and let us give thanks for those that have been found ... ... and who stand here beside us .
now i would like someone else to close this prayer ... ... someone who hasn't spoken here in a long time ... ... but who i believe has something to say that we all need to hear .
i give you morpheus .
zion !
hear me !
it is true what many of you have heard .
the machines have gathered an army , and as i speak ... ... that army is drawing nearer to our home .
believe me when i say we have a difficult time ahead of us .
but if we are to be prepared for it , we must first shed our fear of it .
i stand here before you now truthfully unafraid .
why?
because i believe something you do not?
no !
i stand here without fear because i remember .
i remember that i am here not because of the path that lies before me ... ... but because of the path that lies behind me .
i remember that for 100 years we have fought these machines .
i remember that for 100 years they have sent their armies to destroy us .
we are still here !
tonight ... ... let us send a message to that army .
tonight , let us shake this cave .
tonight , let us tremble these halls ... ... of earth , steel and stone .
let us be heard from red core to black sky .
this is zion and we are not afraid !
i remember .
i remember you used to dance .
i remember you were pretty good .
there are some things in this world , captain niobe ... ... that will never change .
niobe !
some things do change .
excuse me .
i missed you .
i can tell .
i was thinking , everyone is here .
follow me .
neo , what is it?
what's wrong?
it's okay , you can tell me .
trinity ....
don't be afraid .
i can't lose you .
you're not gonna lose me .
you feel this?
i'm never letting go .
good night , zion .
sweet dreams .
you all right?
i'll make it .
did you see that agent?
i've never seen anything like that .
it doesn't matter .
all that matters is this .
you first .
oh , god .
" smith " will suffice .
thank you .
my pleasure .
care for some company?
councillor hamann .
i don't want to intrude if you'd prefer to be alone .
no , i could probably use some company .
good .
so could i.
it's nice tonight .
very calm .
it feels like everyone is sleeping very peacefully .
not everyone .
i hate sleeping .
i never sleep more than a few hours .
i figure i slept the first 11 years of my life , now i'm making up for it .
what about you?
i just haven't been able to sleep much .
it's a good sign .
of what?
that you are in fact still human .
have you ever been to the engineering level?
i love to walk there at night .
it's quite amazing .
would you like to see it?
sure .
almost no one comes down here .
unless , of course , there's a problem .
that's how it is with people .
nobody cares how it works as long as it works .
i like it down here .
i like to be reminded this city survives because of these machines .
these machines are keeping us alive while other machines are coming to kill us .
interesting , isn't it?
the power to give life ...
... and the power to end it .
we have the same power .
yeah , i suppose we do , but ... ... sometimes i think about those people still plugged into the matrix .
and when i look at these machines ... ... i can't help thinking that , in a way , we are plugged into them .
but we control these machines , they don't control us .
of course not .
how could they?
the idea is pure nonsense ... ... but it does make one wonder just ... ... what is control?
if we wanted , we could shut these machines down .
of course .
that's it .
you hit it .
that's control , isn't it?
if we wanted , we could smash them to bits .
although if we did , we'd have to consider what would happen to our lights ... ... our heat , our air .
so we need machines and they need us .
is that your point , councillor?
no .
no point .
old men like me don't bother with making points .
there's no point .
is that why there are no young men on the council?
good point .
why don't you tell me what's on your mind , councillor .
there is so much in this world ... ... that i do not understand .
see that machine?
it has something to do with recycling our water supply .
i have absolutely no idea how it works .
but i do understand the reason for it to work .
i have absolutely no idea how you are able to do some of the things you do .
but i believe there's a reason for that as well .
i only hope we understand that reason before it's too late .
ballard .
ls he here?
neo , it's from the oracle .
it's time to go .
morpheus said this was how it was gonna happen .
i don't know .
maybe the prophecy's true , maybe it's not .
all i know is , that ship needs an operator .
right now , that operator's me .
i know .
zee ....
i want you to wear it .
you know i don't believe in this stuff .
but i do .
it's always brought me luck .
maybe it'll bring me you .
i'm coming back .
i promise .
no matter what it takes , i'm coming home .
just keep it with you .
please .
for me .
okay .
neo !
how the hell?
bane .
is something wrong?
no , i'm fine .
i just wanted to catch you to say ... ... good luck .
thanks .
we'll see you .
neo !
just in time .
you're gonna see the oracle?
there's no time .
i had to give something to neo .
a gift from one of the orphans .
he made me swear to get it to you before you left .
he said you'd understand .
thanks .
i was just told you cleared the nebuchadnezzar for takeoff .
that is correct .
am i still in charge of our defense system?
of course .
i believe i need every ship we have if we're going to survive this attack .
i understand that , commander .
then why did you allow the nebuchadnezzar to leave?
because i believe our survival depends on more than how many ships we have .
be careful .
hello .
you seek the oracle .
who are you?
i am seraph .
i can take you to her , but first i must apologize .
apologize for what?
for this .
good .
the oracle has many enemies .
i had to be sure .
of what?
that you are the one .
you could have just asked .
no .
you do not truly know someone ... ... until you fight them .
come .
she's waiting .
where the hell did they go?
these are back doors , aren't they?
programmer access .
how do they work?
a code is hidden in tumblers .
one position opens a lock and another position opens one of these doors .
are you a programmer?
then what are you?
i protect that which matters most .
well , come on .
i ain't gonna bite you .
come around here and let me have a look at you .
my goodness , look at you .
you turned out all right , didn't you?
how do you feel?
l
i know you're not sleeping .
we'll get to that .
why don't you come and have a sit this time .
maybe i'll stand .
well , suit yourself .
i felt like sitting .
i know .
so ... ... let's get the obvious stuff out of the way .
you're not human , are you?
it's tough to get more obvious than that .
if i had to guess , i'd say you're a program from the machine world .
so is he .
so far , so good .
but if that's true , that could mean you're part of this system ... ... another kind of control .
keep going .
i suppose the most obvious question is ...
... how can i trust you?
bingo .
it is a pickle , no doubt about it .
bad news is ... ... there's no way you can really know if i'm here to help you or not .
so it's really up to you .
just have to make up your own damn mind ... ... to either accept what i'm going to tell you or reject it .
candy?
do you already know if i'll take it?
wouldn't be much of an oracle if i didn't .
but if you already know , how can i make a choice?
because you didn't come here to make the choice .
you've already made it .
you're here to try to understand why you made it .
i thought you'd have figured that out by now .
why are you here?
same reason .
i love candy .
but why help us?
we're all here to do what we're all here to do .
i'm interested in one thing , neo : the future .
and believe me , i know , the only way to get there is together .
are there other programs like you?
well , not like me , but ....
look .
see those birds?
at some point , a program was written to govern them .
a program was written to watch over the trees and the wind , the sunrise and sunset .
there are programs running all over the place .
the ones doing their job , doing what they were meant to do , are invisible .
you'd never even know they were here .
but the other ones ....
well , you hear about them all the time .
i've never heard of them .
of course you have .
every time you've heard someone say they saw a ghost or an angel ... ... every story you've ever heard about vampires , werewolves or aliens ... ... is the system assimilating some program ... ... that's doing something they're not supposed to be doing .
programs hacking programs .
why?
they have their reasons ... ... but usually a program chooses exile when it faces deletion .
and why would a program be deleted?
maybe it breaks down .
maybe a better program is created to replace it .
happens all the time .
and when it does , a program can either choose to hide here ... ... or return to the source .
the machine mainframe .
yes .
where you must go .
where the path of the one ends .
you've seen it ... ... in your dreams , haven't you?
a door made of light?
what happens when you go through the door?
i see trinity ... ... and something happens ... ... something bad .
she starts to fall , and then i wake up .
do you see her die?
no .
you have the sight now , neo .
you are looking at the world without time .
then why can't i see what happens to her?
we can never see past the choices we don't understand .
are you saying i have to choose whether trinity lives or dies?
no , you've already made the choice .
now you have to understand it .
no .
i can't do that .
i won't .
well , you have to .
why?
because you're the one .
what if i can't?
what happens if i fail?
then zion will fall .
our time is up .
listen to me , neo .
you can save zion ... ... if you reach the source , but to do that you need the keymaker .
the keymaker?
he disappeared .
we didn't know what happened to him until now .
he's being held prisoner by a very dangerous program ... ... one of the oldest of us .
he is called the merovingian .
and he won't let him go willingly .
what does he want?
what do all men with power want?
more power .
be there at that exact time ... ... and you will have a chance .
we must go .
seems like every time we meet i got nothing but bad news .
i'm sorry about that .
i surely am .
but for what it's worth ... ... you've made a believer out of me .
good luck , kiddo .
mr. anderson .
did you get my package?
yeah .
well , good .
smith?
he's not reading like an agent .
surprised to see me?
no .
then you're aware of it .
of what?
our connection .
i don't fully understand how it happened .
perhaps some part of you imprinted onto me ... ... something overwritten or copied .
it is , at this point , irrelevant .
what matters is ... ... that whatever happened , happened for a reason .
and what reason is that?
i killed you , mr. anderson .
i watched you die .
with a certain satisfaction , i might add .
and then something happened , something that i knew was impossible ... ... but it happened anyway .
you destroyed me , mr. anderson .
afterward , i knew the rules , i understood what i was supposed to do ... ... but i didn't .
i couldn't .
i was compelled to stay ... ... compelled to disobey .
and now , here i stand because of you , mr. anderson .
because of you , i'm no longer an agent of this system .
because of you , i've changed .
i'm unplugged .
a new man , so to speak .
like you , apparently free .
congratulations .
thank you .
but as you well know , appearances can be deceiving ... ... which brings me back to the reason why we're here .
we're not here because we're free .
we're here because we are not free .
there's no escaping reason , no denying purpose .
because as we both know , without purpose ...
... we would not exist .
it is purpose that created us .
purpose that connects us .
purpose that pulls us .
that guides us .
that drives us .
it is purpose that defines .
purpose that binds us .
we are here because of you , mr. anderson .
purpose .
what's happening to him?
don't know .
yes , that's it .
it'll be over soon .
you .
yes , me .
me , me , me .
me too .
more .
it is inevitable .
come on , get out of there .
are you all right?
it was smith .
yes .
now there's more than one of them?
a lot more .
how is that possible?
i don't know .
somehow , he's found a way to copy himself .
ls that what he was doing to you?
i don't know what he was doing ...
... but i know what it felt like .
what?
it felt like i was back in that hallway .
it felt like dying .
the machines are tunneling to avoid our defense system .
but i believe they will intersect certain pipelines to control them .
these points of intersection are crucial ... ... because i believe they're vulnerable to counterattack .
although it has been suggested that this is the same kind of attack ... ... we've defended for years , i urge the council to realize the truth .
this is the single greatest threat we have ever faced ... ... and if we do not act accordingly , we will not survive .
commander lock , the council is well aware of the seriousness of this attack .
you have our leave to prepare our defense by any and all means necessary .
thank you , council .
however ... ... we ask if there's been word from the nebuchadnezzar .
no , councillor .
no word .
nothing .
then we request a ship be dispatched to ascertain the fate of the one .
i wish that were possible , councillor , but i do not believe our defense ...
... can suffer the loss of another ship .
it will , commander , if it must .
it could take one ship days to find the nebuchadnezzar .
then send two .
this is insane .
careful , commander .
forgive my frustration , councillors .
but i wish i were able to comprehend the council's choice in this matter .
comprehension is not a requisite of cooperation .
if you are asking me to order two of my captains
there's no need for such an order .
the captains are present .
they can answer for themselves .
the council is calling for two volunteers to aid the nebuchadnezzar .
are there two among you that would answer such a call?
captain soren of the vigilant will answer the council's call .
you understand the situation , captain soren?
yes , ma'am .
thank you , captain .
is there another?
captain , i think we should volunteer .
what?
you have gone crazy .
listen  shut your hole , bane ... ... before i put you in one .
is there no other?
be hard for any man to risk his life ... ... especially if he doesn't understand the reason .
captain niobe of the logos will answer the councillor's call .
what?
thank you , captain niobe .
commander lock , you have your orders .
this council is hereby adjourned .
niobe , what are you doing?
what i can .
why?
because some things never change , jason ... ... and some things do .
what can you see , neo?
it's strange .
the code is somehow different .
encrypted?
maybe .
is that good for us or bad for us?
well , it looks like every floor is wired with explosives .
bad for us .
here we go .
yes .
we are here to speak with the merovingian .
well , of course .
he has been expecting you .
follow me .
here he is at last .
neo , the one himself .
right?
and the legendary morpheus .
and trinity , of course .
i have heard so much .
you honor me .
please , sit .
join us .
this is my wife , persephone .
something to eat?
drink?
of course , such things are contrivances , like so much here .
for the sake of appearances .
no , thank you .
yes , of course .
who has time?
who has time?
but then , if we do not ever take time , how can we ever have time?
chteau haut briond , 1959 .
magnificent wine .
i love french wine like i love the french language .
i have sampled every language .
french is my favorite .
fantastic language ... ... especially to curse with .
you see?
it's like wiping your ass with silk .
i love it .
you know why we are here .
i am a trafficker of information .
i know everything i can .
the question is , do you know why you are here?
we are looking for the keymaker .
oh , yes , it is true .
the keymaker , of course .
but this is not a reason , this is not a why .
the keymaker himself , his very nature , is a means , it is not an end .
and so to look for him is to be looking for a means to do ...
... what?
you know the answer to that question .
but do you?
you think you do , but you do not .
you are here because you were sent here .
you were told to come here , and then you obeyed .
it is , of course , the way of all things .
you see , there is only one constant ... ... one universal .
it is the only real truth .
causality .
action , reaction .
cause and effect .
everything begins with choice .
no .
wrong .
choice is an illusion created between those with power ... ... and those without .
look there at that woman .
my god , just look at her ... ... affecting everyone around her .
so obvious , so bourgeois , so boring .
but wait .
watch .
you see , i have sent her a dessert ... ... a very special dessert .
i wrote it myself .
it starts so simply ... ... each line of the program creating a new effect , just like ... ... poetry .
first ... ... a rush , heat .
her heart flutters .
you can see it , neo , yes?
she does not understand why .
is it the wine?
no .
what is it then?
what is the reason?
and soon it does not matter .
soon the why and the reason are gone ... ... and all that matters is the feeling itself .
and this is the nature of the universe .
we struggle against it , we fight to deny it ... ... but it is , of course , pretense .
it is a lie .
beneath our poised appearance ... ... the truth is , we are completely ... ... out of control .
causality .
there is no escape from it .
we are forever slaves to it .
our only hope , our only peace , is to understand it , to understand the why .
why " is what separates us from them ... ... you from me .
why " is the only real source of power .
without it , you are powerless .
and this is how you come to me , without why , without power .
another link in the chain .
but fear not .
since i have seen how good you are at following orders ... ... i will tell you what to do next .
her time is almost up .
now i have some real business to do , so i will say adieu and goodbye .
this isn't over .
oh , yes , it is .
the keymaker is mine , and i see no reason why i should give him up .
no reason at all .
where are you going?
please , ma chrie , i have told you .
we are all victims of causality .
i drank too much wine , i must take a piss .
cause and effect .
au revoir .
touch me and that hand will never touch anything again .
well , that didn't go so well .
are you certain the oracle didn't say anything else?
yes .
maybe we did something wrong .
or didn't do something .
no , what happened couldn't have happened any other way .
how do you know?
we are still alive .
if you want the keymaker , follow me .
get out .
i am so sick and tired of his bullshit .
on and on .
pompous prick .
a long time ago , when we first came here , it was so different .
he was so different .
he was like you .
i'll give you what you want , but you have to give me something .
what?
a kiss .
excuse me?
i want you to kiss me as if you were kissing her .
why?
you love her .
she loves you .
it's all over you both .
a long time ago , i knew what that felt like .
i want to remember it .
i want to sample it .
that's all .
just a sample .
why don't you sample this instead?
trinity .
such emotion over something so small .
it's just a kiss .
why should we trust you?
if i don't deliver you to the keymaker , she can kill me .
all right .
but you have to make me believe i am her .
all right .
terrible .
forget it .
wait .
okay .
yes .
that's it .
i envy you .
but such a thing is not meant to last .
come with me .
not again .
it's all right , boys .
they're with me .
these fellas work for my husband .
they do his dirty work .
they're very good , very loyal .
aren't you , boys?
yes , mistress .
they come from a much older version of the matrix .
but like so many back then , they caused more problems than they solved .
my husband saved them because they're notoriously difficult to terminate .
how many people keep silver bullets in their gun?
you can either run and tell my husband what i have done ... ... or you can stay there and die .
he's in the ladies 'room !
hurry .
my name is neo .
yes .
i'm the keymaker .
i've been waiting for you .
my god !
my god , persephone , how could you do this?
you betray me .
cause and effect , my love .
cause?
there is no cause for this .
what cause?
what cause?
how about the lipstick you're still wearing?
lipstick?
lipstick .
what craziness are you talking about , woman?
there is no lipstick !
she wasn't kissing your face , my love .
woman , this is nothing .
it is a game .
it is only a game .
so is this .
have fun .
all right .
all right .
let us find out where this goes .
you two , get the keymaker .
that's a nice trick .
i cannot go back .
i'll handle them .
handle us?
you'll handle us?
you know , your predecessors had much more respect .
okay , you have some skill .
kill him .
you see?
he's just a man .
goddamn it , woman , you will be the end of me .
mark my words , boy , and mark them well .
i have survived your predecessors , and i will survive you .
