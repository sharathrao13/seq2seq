look at what i got .
so that's what you been hiding .
don't you want to share?
take it .
just leave me alone .
you got family , girl , with anything to trade?
yes .
my daddy has canned goods and gasoline .
this little girl's plump .
she'll feed us for a week .
it's him .
i know it's him .
take the food and let the girl go .
i won't give you a second chance .
kill her .
i'm walkin 'outta here , garth .
try and stop me , she's dead .
do you hear me?
mandy , close your eyes .
no !
wait !
your mom was worried about you .
was it always like this , garth?
no .
the world was once beautiful , baby .
but we betrayed her and she turned her back on us .
will she ever forgive us?
yeah .
when we've learned our lesson .
ok .
open her up .
mandy !
look , mom .
i found bread .
where have you been?
i have been worried sick .
i found her about six blocks south of here .
thank you .
mom , look .
bread .
yeah .
put that away now , ok?
one of the hunters found meat .
and we have stew .
take it easy .
it won't be long now .
don't talk like that .
it's the truth and we both well know it .
what have you got there?
we got us some soup .
van owen says he killed a coyote .
he brought the meat in already butchered .
there's no coyotes left .
not even in the canyons .
killed six men today .
three over this and three over the parker girl .
things are getting worse .
as if that were possible .
drop 'em .
or you're dead .
lapierre .
long time .
i'm afraid you would have been disappointed .
we ain't got much .
i ain't come for what you have .
in fact , we brought gifts .
peaches .
they're real !
you didn't come for food .
what did you come here for?
you .
what did he want?
a meeting .
between me and a man named reich .
anton reich .
says he works for him .
in some capacity .
lapierre only works in one capacity .
are you going?
i don't see the harm in it .
famous last words .
i didn't know there were any of these things left running .
you'd be surprised what's left if you know the right people .
do you like bach , major?
yeah , it's all right .
his peers considered him to be the supreme master of counterpoint , best evidenced by this toccata and fugue in d minor .
additionally he sired 20 children .
some men do lead prodigious lives .
take your father , for instance .
general thomas garth .
leader of the melbourne invasion of '66 .
commanded the nato alliance .
sired one john thomas garth .
enlisted at 16 .
joined delta force a year later .
distinguished combat record , taipan wars .
two purple hearts , a service cross and the congressional medal of honor .
a truly excellent resume , major .
i'm not a major any more .
i'm just a man trying to survive .
like everyone else .
anton reich .
are you hungry?
what i have is not steak or lobster , but it is hot and filling .
see to it .
you knew him before the fall?
yeah , he was a ranger .
but you were adversaries .
competitors .
he had his way , i had mine .
and whose was best?
what is it you want , mr reich?
your skill , obviously .
i want to hire you .
to do what?
can you guess what it is i did before the fall?
i don't know .
businessman .
you can do better than that , major .
your clothes were handcrafted in europe , but it's the crest on your cufflinks that says austrian aristocracy .
this facility was systematised before the fall .
which shows your foresightedness .
you surround yourself with paramilitary , but you can control them .
i would guess you ran a conglomerate or a large enterprise .
bravo , major .
that's true enough .
but my passion , my real passion , is not nearly so transparent .
art?
art is more than just brush strokes against canvas .
it's the epitome of human existence .
10 % of the world's greatest pieces lie within a five mile radius of where we are .
i want you to retrieve for me as much of it as you can .
tell me , have you heard of the vincent estate?
sure .
in the valley , in the sepulveda pass .
built by some billionaire recluse .
rumoured to be the most heavily secured building in the us .
the rumours are true , i can assure you .
i've sent several contingents up there to investigate .
none have returned .
what makes you think it hasn't been looted too?
i knew vincent .
we were also competitors .
in the years before his seclusion he began work on a formidable security system .
use lapierre .
he's good enough .
he can handle heavy stuff .
but he's a soldier .
he could never have seen me the way you did in there .
how's it powered?
by nuclear reactor .
modelled after the one here at ucla .
and if i succeed?
all the food , ammunition and goods your people could desire .
living out of a sewer doesn't suit you , major .
eating rats and god knows what else .
i'm giving you an opportunity to reclaim your dignity .
what do you say?
vincent estate is protected by surface to air missiles .
anything that comes near the place goes up in smoke .
you tried it?
of course .
the grounds are protected by shadow battle units .
you telling me you can't send something in there and remote detonate it?
the walls are made from blended armour .
even if we could , mr reich doesn't want to risk damaging the collection .
tell him .
there's something else .
encrypt .
we're not sure what the acronym stands for .
before the fall mr reich's people downloaded some transmissions detailing a security program that oversees the entire state .
what kind of program?
the sentient kind .
is there any good news?
yes .
you won't be going in alone .
hernandez .
she's been a shadow on every corner of the world .
never been a recon better .
if there's a crack in the wall , she can slip inside .
king .
ex marine sniper .
39 confirmed kills .
if he can see it , he can shoot it .
nobody handles the heavy stuff better .
what heavy stuff?
pray you never find out , little sister .
edershaw .
best tech man in 36 states .
except florida .
there's a key man who lives there .
calls himself the shawl .
he's good .
real good .
he's odd , but he gets the job done .
call me the poet .
everybody does .
that's your team?
no .
lapierre's going in too .
save it .
whatever past you two have , leave it there .
you're professionals .
for a chance to pull this off , you'll need each other .
you're assuming i'm in .
i haven't agreed .
that's right .
you haven't , have you?
coumadin and warfarin .
50mg of anticoagulant injections .
for those blood clots in your father's legs , correct?
is there anything you don't know?
our chance of success .
i don't do anything till the food and the medicine are delivered .
half now and half when the operation is completed .
and i am in total command .
that is the entente .
i haven't heard him say it .
you just do your job , garth .
i'll do mine .
unbeknownst to many , vincent industries was also creating combat systems .
the estate is protected by platforms inside and out .
so not your first foray .
who went in?
you?
no .
leon vega .
vega?
where is he?
dead .
but he got further than anyone before , if that's of any condolence .
ever worn force field armour before?
no .
it was introduced during the last days of the pentagon .
they're lithium battery operated .
these read outs tell you your count .
generally speaking , the armour is good for 100 rounds of 5 . 56 or 75 rounds of 7 . 62 .
grenades and pulse weapons will take a toll of between 10 and 100 points depending on proximity of impact .
does everyone follow?
yes , sir .
this is a battery pack .
it holds 20 additional battery units .
each isolated to prevent current overflow .
change batteries between firefights or whenever it becomes depleted .
some units may protect past the hundred mark , but i wouldn't count on it .
should have gone with the energizers .
mr king .
would you step away from the others?
gentlemen and hernandez , you might want to step back .
glancing rounds will deflect .
wait a minute .
son of a bitch .
it is advisable to seek cover when being fired upon .
while rounds can't penetrate , the force can disorientate and render the recipient unconscious .
i've avoided the head and certain appendages for demonstration purposes .
without the armour , they are vulnerable .
mr king , you've just taken 90 direct hits .
normally one would have been enough to kill you .
how do you feel?
swell .
good .
thank you for participating .
keeps going and going and ...
shut up .
you got good taste .
the pulse rifle has a punch of 50 with almost no recoil .
it uses the same batteries as the armour , 50 rounds of decreasing intensity .
you can also use it for regular firepower .
downside?
the barrel can overheat and fracture .
guess that's acceptable .
about vega ...
save it .
he knew the risks .
just like we do .
radio signals are jammed inside the estate .
but it will work once it powers down .
get over to the central atrium then down to the second sub floor .
shut the nuke down , then head outside and give me a call .
i'll come in .
i wish you luck , major .
lapierre .
shadow units !
where are they coming from?
i can't get a lock .
cease fire !
don't fire unless you see something .
stop wasting ammo .
where are they coming from?
i can't get a lock .
check the footprints in the snow .
is that it?
are they all gone?
going thermal .
edershaw .
behind you .
count off .
hernandez .
alive and kicking , sir .
king .
a ok .
lapierre .
everyone's cool .
let's move .
move it .
fire in the hole .
wait , wait , wait .
fortune always leaves some doors open . " cervantes .
" into a closed mouth no flies will enter .
no defensive platforms .
the doors behind me lead to the housing wings .
we want the far end .
but behind those doors?
that's where the fun begins .
hernandez .
how's your impact rating?
cherry , sir .
how's yours?
peachy .
let's move .
on the other side there's no stepping back .
the team's going to look to you .
body , three o'clock .
put your hands up .
edershaw , perimeter .
all clear .
stop where you are .
don't move .
i have the shot .
negative .
she's unarmed .
on your face , lady , now .
i said eat the floor , now .
team .
on me .
lapierre , wait .
that wasn't very smart , was it?
by the look of you , i suspect intelligence is an undervalued commodity .
it's a hologram .
you are all intruders here , but your damage is limited to the outside .
i'm sure if you flee now , a full scale pursuit will not ensue .
lapierre , is it ...
encrypt?
i think so .
shall we take it out?
no .
reich seemed to intimate it ...
stop !
stop referring to me as " it " !
my name is diana , gentlemen .
you might be thieves , but you needn't be discourteous ones .
diana?
that's correct .
and you are?
moving on .
have i mentioned the police are on their way?
there are no police any more .
what do you mean?
projection point .
please .
don't fire again .
i'm only trying to help you .
i got it .
if you destroy my apparatus i will have no choice but to take appropriate measures .
if you could shut all women up with a push of a button it'd be a perfect world .
appropriate measures?
i don't see the sky falling .
gas !
hit the floor .
i can't breathe .
king .
put your mask on .
come on .
get it on .
i'm all right .
you were saying?
if gas is all they've got , this is going to be a breeze .
i'm inclined to disagree with you .
wait .
please .
let me speak .
am i correct in assuming you are in charge?
no .
you are .
you won't reach what you're after .
from this point on i will be unable to aid you as i did with the shadow units and the gas .
aid us?
what is she talking about?
if you like , you can remove your masks .
it's quite safe now .
may i remind you , i am the guardian of this facility , yet i still value human life .
but even my security protocols have backups .
i don't know where the police are .
there are no police any more .
and the world?
is gone .
at least as your programmers perceived it .
you might wish the police had come .
is that right?
this facility is defended by an upgrade of a vincent embassy protection system .
lethal defence systems .
killing machines .
you've been warned .
great , we've been warned .
now can we get moving or what?
hello , boys and girls .
my name is diana .
i'm the chief of security .
what the hell is this?
i'm your guide .
it's it again .
no , it's something different .
who can tell me who mr vincent is?
she was once human .
i don't know about the richest man ...
king triggered an old holograph of her .
the mr vincent i know loves art more than anything else in the world and has built this residence so it could be converted into a museum and all these beautiful paintings you see on the walls could find a home .
looks clear .
make sure .
what was that?
theodore vincent was quite the philanthropist .
he didn't see his accumulation of art as possessory .
unlike most collectors of his era , his was not locked away in a room or buried in a safety deposit box , but displayed here for all to see .
his hospitality sure has made an impact on all of us .
you deny you're here to steal?
no .
although my clients would describe it differently .
repatriate .
yeah .
something like that .
did you know him?
before he died?
yes .
he was like a father to me .
and to many others , mr garth .
what?
what is it?
you called me garth .
my sensors are finely tuned .
i can pick up all audible conversations , body language , physiological changes , reflections of truth , dishonesty and more .
for instance , i know you would rather not be here .
do you?
and i know that you're a good man , as evidenced by an exemplary military record , lack of criminal record and social achievements by your wife and offspring .
i see this is an uncomfortable subject for you .
i apologise for the interjection .
it was a long time ago , diana .
before they made machines like you .
major .
i think you want to see this .
what do you make of this?
some kind of puzzle?
diana , is this a trap?
vincent's dead and he took the civilised world with him .
there's a man out there willing to carry on his legacy .
if you value human life , you'll help us .
i'm sorry , major garth .
but i'm afraid that's not my prime directive .
getting tired of her voice anyway .
heard that .
can't be too hard .
in my experience puzzles like this are easy .
like riddles .
it's a riddle wrapped in a mystery ...
shut up , edershaw .
the question is ... where do we start?
how about the beginning?
be careful , king .
it's ok , hernandez .
i know the way .
are you hurt?
no , negative .
armour protected me .
well , that rules that out .
no , there's got to be a trick .
nobody could memorise these numbers .
we could ask diana , but she ain't talking .
maybe she already did .
she said helping us wasn't her prime directive .
so?
it seems like a robotic response .
if she doesn't want to be regarded as a robot , why say that?
so it's a clue .
prime numbers .
what?
a number only divisible by itself and one .
1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 7 ...
11 .
12 .
no .
13 , 17 , 19 .
ok , hernandez .
so give it a shot .
yes , sir .
yes !
all right .
all right , mr poet , it's your turn .
we all know what shakespeare said .
courage mounteth with occasion .
that's right , mr bard .
now mounteth your ass over here .
let's go .
it is better to be the widow of a hero than a wife of a coward . " ibarruri .
what the hell's he talking about?
virgil .
fortune favours the bold .
what?
don't tell me you guys don't like virgil .
edershaw .
don't turn around .
edershaw , move .
hernandez?
don't have the shot .
let's move .
i warned you .
that you did .
and now you plan to continue on?
we do .
i don't understand your actions , john garth .
they're not consistent with the data i have retrieved on you .
perhaps the outside world has moved on .
perhaps you're not the same man who earned those commendations of valour .
you disappoint me , john .
you wouldn't be the first .
king , hernandez , secure perimeter .
how are we , major?
as far as i can tell , ahead of schedule .
this is the last room before we make our descent into the sub floors .
no , i meant how are yo u doing?
fine .
other than losing one of my soldiers ... fine .
good .
i'd hate to think that all the psychobabble that talking polaroid has turned your way might be sinking in .
you've a problem with how i lead things?
i'm just concerned .
are you?
you've always been a good soldier .
a little too ione wolf for my taste , but you got the job done .
i just don't see how this encrypt ...
you mean diana .
diana .
is doing us any good .
in fact , i think she might be playing on your sense of morality .
and if it is?
then we may have to re evaluate the chain of command .
let me tell you something .
i signed up to lead this mission and i'll see it through .
morality and conscience mean little when set against a camp full of hungry people .
my people .
so you don't concern yourself with my actions , captain .
the room is secure , major .
the stairwell door's barred shut .
it's going to take an hour to get through .
ok .
hernandez , can you manage up some grub?
are you asking me because i'm a woman?
i'm asking you cos the thought of king's cooking scares the hell out of me .
i'll dig something up .
diana .
yes , john?
so it's john now , is it?
what was this room?
this was the greek gallery .
it encompassed art from the early classical period from 480 bc to the hellenistic age of 323 bc .
it was my favourite .
why is that?
because the principal subjects of greek sculpture were gods .
heroes of legend and maidens intended to demonstrate ideals of beauty .
you were a romantic .
ironically , the piece i most enjoyed was situated where you now stand .
what was it?
it was an older piece .
a skilfully modelled terracotta centaur made about 900 bc at lefkandi on the island of euboea .
mr vincent acquired it from the louvre before paris burned the second time .
why was it your favourite , diana?
it was a simple piece .
but no matter how many times i gazed at it , i always found something new .
beauty is in the eye of the beholder .
if edershaw was alive , i'm sure he could tell us who said that .
margaret wolfe hungerford .
ah .
a romantic and a poet .
no .
as you pointed out , just a machine .
i wish that i could have seen it .
i wish you could turn back .
but since you will not , you should rest your eyes .
you're weary .
this gallery is called the greek room because all the antiquities displayed here originated in classical times .
does anyone know what classical means?
yes .
classical means pre christian , or before the rise of christianity .
note this statue of agamemnon , whose sister in law helen was stolen by paris , son of priam , king of troy .
and so started the trojan war .
gear's all set , major .
batteries charged?
yes , sir .
ok .
let's do it .
diana .
can you tell us about the security in the stairwell?
i can't .
does that mean there is none?
that means i cannot reveal any features installed to prohibit you from your illegal activities .
it would be counterproductive to my mission .
her mission is to see us all get killed .
that is not correct , salia hernandez .
i do not want to see any of you die .
any of us?
or just john?
any of you .
i value human life .
and your boss , vincent .
did he value it when he installed these machines to protect his trinkets?
we never expected to need them .
or to kill anyone?
of course not .
then we should be dodging blanks now .
you were vincent's chief of security .
yes .
it's funny .
you don't strike me as someone who winds up being chief of security .
it's a little late to start quibbling over qualifications .
you and vincent were friends .
are you insinuating something?
he's insinuating you're good iooking .
it's not a new observation .
you and vincent were lovers , he rewarded you .
i hope your deaths are quick and painless .
not the send off i was hoping for .
what is that , gas?
steam .
must be near the boiler .
or the nuke .
intel says the nuke is on the next floor down .
yeah?
well , what's on this floor?
what the hell is that?
defensive positions .
does anyone see anything?
negative .
hernandez , go night vision .
negative , sir .
nothing's out there .
twelve o'clock !
lay off !
what the hell are you shooting at?
i thought i saw something , sir .
diana !
diana , are you here?
a woman scorned , major .
sir?
does everybody see that?
does anyone know what the hell it is?
ghosts .
rounds go right through these things .
how can we shoot them?
have we got any intel on these things?
negative .
hold your fire !
what is it , major?
i want to try something .
we got you .
it's like i thought .
they're holograms , like our friend , only this one's formless , like a ghost .
a hologram .
like diana .
where's the projection coming from?
it got the major !
major , you all right?
how is he?
took a lickin ', still tickin '.
wrist counter's at 43 .
12 o'clock !
hold your fire .
stop wasting ammo .
they're ground units .
wait for the buzz then shoot at the ground beneath them .
good shooting , sir .
three o'clock .
they're everywhere .
this isn't working .
don't let them get a lock on you .
come on .
get some !
garth , behind you .
heat .
they're tracking us by heat .
use your flares .
ok .
now .
fire .
is that it?
did we get 'em all?
hell , yes we did !
quick thinking .
good work .
you too .
king , check this out .
my daddy said it's better to be lucky than good .
ain't it beautiful when you're both?
you see me moving out there?
no !
it's the last one .
how did we miss it?
hernandez .
baby , you all right?
i'm good , king .
i'm good to go .
just give me a sec .
changing my battery .
no , you just rest , hernandez .
you done good .
just take a little rest .
don't go on without me , sir .
no .
we won't .
if you do ... who's going to do the ... cooking?
where's hernandez?
she didn't make it .
i'm sorry .
i thought the steam venting might disable the units , as it did my equipment .
apparently i was wrong .
yeah , you were wrong .
and now hernandez is dead .
so you got what you wanted .
i never wanted anyone dead .
i told you from the beginning , you cannot defeat the security systems .
they're insurmountable .
you are the security systems .
no .
i'm the chief of security , not the system itself .
if we went back , you'd clear the way?
of course , but ...
then clear the way in front of us .
stand down the security protocols .
i can't .
the defensive equipment is linked to my autonomic nervous system .
i can no more do it than stop breathing .
you're not breathing .
you're a machine .
we're wasting time .
i do not believe you are in this for the recovery of art .
my sensors indicate neither dislike or favour for it .
you had a discussion with captain lapierre about your people needing food .
spying bitch .
forget her .
has the world really relapsed to a point where food , the most basic of human needs , is worth such a premium?
john , has the world truly devolved to this?
yes .
and your employer has he made an agreement with you regarding food for the people you care for?
it's playing with you .
shut up , lapierre .
yeah .
food and medicine .
i will supply it for you .
i can tell you where there's food .
tons of it .
earthquake supplies .
wafers , cakes , water , coffee ...
medicine?
yes .
she's lying .
john , if i supply you with the whereabouts of these things , will you turn back from this quest you are on?
will you , john?
no .
i can't .
why not?
cos i made an agreement .
do you always keep your agreements?
is there any condition under which this contract might be broken?
only if the other side breaks it first .
this puts me at a disadvantage .
i would like to help you .
i would like to see you survive .
but by your own admission you seek to terminate me .
i may be a machine , john , but i was once alive .
and now this image before you is all i have left .
it's an illusion .
isn't all life an illusion?
vincent enterprises developed a way to move my consciousness into a computer because my body was diseased .
i was dying .
it's playing on your sympathies .
there's a basic need for survival .
that's how i know i'm still human , john .
even in this form i can still breathe .
would you take that away from me?
just tell us where the command corridor is .
the command corridor?
i thought you were looking to shut down the power .
i am .
we are .
isn't that where the nuke controls are?
no .
they're in the energy control room .
your intel would have disclosed that .
if our intel disclosed everything , diana , we would have prevented you from killing hernandez and edershaw .
you're heading into the residence .
after that there will be no turning back .
in this very corridor there is an escape feature which i can activate and which will catapult you to the rear garden .
if you choose this feature , i can tell you how to retrieve the earthquake supplies .
there is no shame in accepting this .
it is the wiser choice for those you care for .
please don't go in there .
i don't want to see you die .
john?
this was vincent's residence?
yes .
he was a ... modest man .
he was a wacko .
i've seen better rooms in motel 6 .
when a man of mr vincent's stature dedicates himself to creating a museum of our species 'greatest masterpieces , he has little time for self indulgent comforts .
he spent less than four hours a day here , and only then to sleep .
only then?
seems vincent's resume wasn't limited to ... procurer .
what about connoisseur?
now that's some fine art !
i'm not ashamed of it .
we're going to look for the stairwell down to the second sub floor .
king .
i was a graduate student at ucla .
mr vincent ...
you can drop the mr now .
i'll call him any damn thing i want .
he pursued me to model for him .
finally i relented .
was he that good or were you that good?
mr vincent's interest in me exceeded the professional .
he was in love with me .
i never returned the affection .
you're lying .
what?
he bought you with a job .
expect me to believe he didn't buy the rest of you?
you son of a bitch .
vincent wasn't the kind of guy that didn't get what he wanted .
unless ...
unless what?
when you were diagnosed as terminal did you get a second opinion?
of course .
not from one of vincent's doctors?
no .
what are you implying?
he wanted you , didn't he?
he got to keep you young and beautiful .
his one of a kind super computer .
never to grow old , never to die ...
immortal .
and his .
forever .
garth .
major .
you should see this .
tell him what you told me .
it's titanium alloy .
if we use a standard laser , it'd take a week to get through .
can we blow it?
not this close to the nuke .
seen a couple of these over the years .
creator built them to withstand anything .
but there's a flaw .
hinging mechanisms buckle under heat .
so if we create the heat i need using the plasma cutter , we can take it down .
time?
a few hours at least .
get on it .
it's a two man job .
get back to the residence .
we'll come get you when we're done .
garth .
you done good so far .
that will require some attention .
i hate it when you do that .
you'd rather i leave?
you'll do as you wish .
i know why you're really here .
do you?
because of them .
elaine and christopher .
how do you know their names?
of your wife and son?
i've seen them .
or recordings of them .
the national security computer's still up .
mr vincent has a key .
the satellite communication system is still working .
show me .
during your last security clearance review they shot some film of your family .
you two look wonderful together .
see?
i can understand why you're doing this .
they're not real .
they're not real any more .
what happened?
during the breakdown we were visiting elaine's mother .
my father , he lives on the east side .
i went to get him .
there were riots .
the whole city was on fire .
people were killing each other .
it took me days to get back .
and by the time i did they were gone .
so you never learned .
i'm a soldier .
i face the truth .
i know they're dead .
but in your heart ...
you want to make sure .
john ...
on the desk there's a pair of vr glasses .
put them on .
please .
for me .
john?
i know you're out there , john .
they're coming this way .
we can't stay any longer .
i've used the last of mom's jewellery to secure us passage on a ship .
we're heading north .
it's the best i can do for them now .
i know you'll follow and i know you'll find us .
we're survivors , john .
just like you .
don't give up on us .
it's gotten bad , john .
the storm started two days ago and it hasn't let up .
elaine .
we can't get to shore .
i'm afraid , john .
i'm so afraid .
knowing you're out there means we're still alive .
you get that , don't you , john?
this may be the end for me , but not for us .
be strong , my love .
know we love you .
and as long as you're alive with memories of us , as long as it burns within you , we will always be together .
elaine , don't go .
thank you .
thanks for that .
i know what yo u are after .
ignore her .
you won't reach it .
you sound like a broken record .
if you go down there , i can't protect you .
protect us?
you don't think you've defeated all the security systems by yourself , do you?
what if i had sent them all at once?
blah , blah , blah .
listen to me , captain .
downstairs is different .
the computer room is down there , along with the weapons storage bays .
there's a stand alone system down there , fully automated .
a killing machine .
get back to work .
it's called the rook .
it was designed to replace soldiers on the battlefield .
it's dormant now , but as soon as your heat signature reads on the bottom floor the rook will activate and kill you .
shut up .
i'm asking you ...
i said shut up !
i don't wanna hear any more of your lies .
if you continue in this manner , i'll have to tell major garth what you're truly after .
what's she talking about?
i said mind your work .
please .
reconsider .
no .
john .
john !
lapierre's gone .
i couldn't stop him .
king !
king !
yeah .
lapierre took off .
there's something you should know .
the captain is not after mr vincent's art .
what , then?
before his death mr vincent had created a microorganism transmitted by seeds , capable of returning the ozone layer to its previous state within a decade .
global warming will be reduced and the earth will be reborn .
why didn't he release it , then?
the system had been sabotaged .
by the time it was repaired vincent had died and i alone could not activate it .
who were the saboteurs?
trusted associates working for a man who had created a food substitute .
anton reich .
encrypt , this is diana 1716 theta theta 6 .
rook activation override .
cease now .
y o u are n o t auth o rised .
emergency override .
cancel activation .
y o u are n o t auth o rised .
how do we stop this thing?
you can't .
the rook is a fully autonomous operative .
its body armour is five times more effective than the armour you wear now .
it can destroy anything in this facility .
everything has a weakness .
the rook doesn't .
where's lapierre?
in the command corridor .
right now he's talking with mr reich by radio .
they're attempting to raise the pod seed mechanisms so they may be recovered .
son of a bitch wants more compensation .
we have to activate that technology , or ...
go .
i'll handle the rook .
you can't .
it's a rook .
i'm a king .
i'll checkmate its ass .
go save the world .
he's taken the remote detonator unit .
the pod terminals have risen .
major .
stings like a bitch , don't it?
captain , you can't beat the rook .
never could stand that haughty broad .
talking about vincent like he's a humanitarian , when he's no better than any other rich bastard looking for a martyrdom legacy .
why?
you're asking me why , major?
the world went from ten billion to less than a million .
and what's left but false hope and real estate?
the pods will be released eventually .
but first reich will have his organic food empire .
and i'll be the general that runs it .
are you nuts?
reich's going to burn you .
reich needs me .
he's got the vision but i am the implementation .
and when he's gone ...
ch o pper f o ur , whisk y papa .
lapierre , c o me in .
go ahead .
can yo u c o nfirm deactivati o n?
roger that .
sams are offline .
you're clear to land .
repeat , clear to land .
underst oo d .
whisk y papa o ut .
i can't let you do it .
you can't?
how are you going to stop me?
i got your pulse rifle .
diana's taking a nap somewhere .
you've lost .
what makes you think you could stop me?
cos i know something you don't .
yeah?
and what's that?
you can't fight the rook alone .
the rook is just another one of your girlfriend's inventions .
oh , yeah?
why don't you tell that to king?
you're going to be seeing him soon .
it's real .
yeah , he's real .
real pissed off .
you got one chance .
that's us fighting it together .
no way .
i give you back the rifle , you frag me .
think of the consequences .
i can't beat the thing alone .
and i got to stay alive for my old man .
what do you say , captain?
what do you say?
lapierre !
your armour .
put it on him .
i'll shoot the battery pack .
no !
do it .
now !
good work , major .
you found me .
are you ...?
yes .
the disembodiment process is a one sided feature .
once the neural energy is transferred there is no going back .
then why?
theodore vincent wanted my body as much as my mind .
that's him?
yes .
near the end his health began to diminish .
he had plans to join me in immortality , but he made one crucial error .
what's that?
he underestimated me .
he thought his files were encrypted and that i would never learn the truth .
the truth you so acutely guessed .
i wasn't dying , you see , after all .
it was all a ruse .
a ruse to possess me , to enslave me .
in the end it was his love for technology that betrayed him .
a simple camera in a simple room during a simple conversation .
you were justified .
was i?
mm .
for 20 years i've lived in a prison .
alone .
did i murder him or save him a life of hell , just like mine?
not much of a choice .
no .
it's not .
no .
i would live in here with you a thousand times over .
but you are not dead , john garth .
you don't have to make the choice .
in fact , you still have some work to do .
lapierre is almost at the courtyard where the pod seed cannons are .
let me show you another way .
hurry .
going somewhere?
you just don't quit .
hoo wah .
vega was the same way .
when he learned what we wanted to do , he tried to walk away .
issue of morality .
had to shoot him down like a dog .
do i have to do the same to you?
only if you want to go to hell with me .
what's it going to take , garth?
i don't imagine you're going to let us walk out of here with this .
you want it?
come get it .
i wasn't hoping for anything less .
now we know , huh?
that was for vega .
well done , major garth .
well done .
lapierre told me you were good , but i didn't expect that good .
it's too bad really .
i could have used your experience .
oh , well .
there's always survivors eager to make a buck .
really that's what i want to do .
mankind will be served , but only after i do some business first .
i won't let you do it .
you're bleeding to death , major .
you can't move .
how can you stop me?
with the push of a button .
you're quite the mess , john garth .
i'm dying .
no .
not yet .
somebody's at the gate .
what is it , general?
salvation .
what is it?
what do you see?
a new day .
