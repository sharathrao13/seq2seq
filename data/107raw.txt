in jailhouse rock , he was everything rockabilly is about .

in that movie , he couldn't give a fuck about nothin '.
except rocking and rolling , living fast , dying young ... ... and leaving a good looking corpse .
i watch that hillbilly and i want to be him so bad .
elvis looked good .
hey , i'm no fag .
but elvis was prettier than most women .
you know?
most women .
you know i always said , if i had to fuck a guy .
i mean had to ... ... and my life depended on it ... ... l'd fuck elvis .
i'd fuck elvis .
really?
well , when he was alive , not now .
i don't blame you .
so , we'd both fuck elvis .
it's nice to meet people with common interests , ain't it?
well , enough about the king .

you want to take me to a kung fu movie?
three kung fu movies .
i don't think so .
not really my cup of tea .
all right .
l had to come all the way from the highways and byways ... ... of tallahassee , florida ... ... to motor city , detroit to find my true love .
lf you gave me a million years to ponder ... ... l would never have guessed that true romance and detroit would go together .
and to this day , the events that followed all seem like a distant dream .
but the dream was real ... ... and was to change our lives forever .
l kept asking clarence why our world seemed to be collapsing ... ... and everything was so shitty .
" that's the way it goes .
but don't forget ... " ... it goes the other way too .
that's the way romance is .
usually that's the way it goes .
but every once in a while , it goes the other way too .
my heart beats and there is time .
don't move , tojo .
you'll be unconscious soon ... lt's an ancient technique .
oxygen .
come .
oh , look what happened !
oh , god , i am so sorry .
are you okay?
yeah , i'm fine .
oh , jesus , i am the clumsiest person in the world .
that's all right .
accidents happen .
what a wonderful philosophy .
thanks for being a sweetheart .
because you could have been a real dick .

he ain't so much a good guy as he's just a bad motherfucker .
i mean , he gets paid by people to fuck guys up .
you know .
you came to see three kung fu movies?
sure , why not?
nothing , nothing .
you're a girl after my own heart .
that's all .

sort of a little tradition i have .
do you like to get pie after you see a good movie?
yeah , i love to get pie after a movie .
would you like to go get some pie with me?
i'd love some pie .

the boss is a pretty nice guy .
he lets you borrow money from time to time , if you need it .
you want to see what spiderman no .
1 looks like?
you bet .
just great stories , great characters , beautiful artwork .
see , in this one , nick , he's gotten this ring here ... ... for his sweetheart and he wears it around his neck on a chain .
and later on in the story , he gets in this fight with this nazi bastard .
and the kraut grabs hold of the chain .
well , the ring goes overboard .
nick , he dives into the ocean to get it .
isn't that cool?
what is it?
you're crying?
what did i do?
did i do something?
you didn't do nothing .
what is it?
i have something i got to tell you .
i didn't just happen to be at that theater .
i was paid to be there .
if you were paid to be there , what are you?
a theater checker?
you get paid to check the box office girls aren't ripping the place off?
i'm no theater checker .
i'm a call girl .
you're a whore?
no !
i'm a call girl , and there is a difference , you know !
okay , here it goes .
you know the place you took me to last night?
the place you work .
heroes for sale?
you got a boss , right?
yeah .
okay , what's his name?
lance .
that's him .
he called the place where i work .
he ordered a girl .
he wanted you to get laid .
said you didn't get out much , and it was your birthday and all .
he wanted me to act like i just showed up .
how did he know you were going to be at that theater?
i go to the movies every year on my birthday .
he called me this week to find out what my birthday movie was going to be .
you're not mad?
no , man .
i can't tell you ...
that was one of the best times i ever had .
it was .
you know , i knew something must be rotten in denmark .
there's no way you could like me that much .
i was so relieved when you took off your dress ... ... and didn't have a dick .
stop being so fucking calm about all this !
look in your house .
there's a note on your tv .
it only says " dear clarence , " because i couldn't write anymore .
so i just said , " alabama , come clean .
just tell him what's what .
if he tells you ...
... to go back to drexl and fuck yourself ...
... then go back to drexl and fuck yourself .
drexl?
what's a drexl?
please shut up !
i'm trying to come clean .
i've been a call girl for exactly four days and you are my third customer .
i want you to know , that i am not damaged goods .
i'm not what they call in florida , white trash !
i'm a really good person .
and when it comes to relationships ... ... l am one hundred percent .
i am one hundred percent monogamous .
you stay with one guy?
exactly .
if i'm with you , then i'm with you .
and i don't want anybody else .
now , i got to tell you something else .
when you said last night was one of the best times you've had ... ... did you mean physically?
yeah , yeah .
but i'm talking about the whole night .
i never had as much fun with a girl , as i had with you , my whole life .
it's true .
you like elvis .
you like janis ... ... you like kung fu movies .
you like the partridge family ...
actually , i don't like the partridge family .
that was part of the act .
and i feel really goofy saying this ... ... after only knowing you one night , and me being a call girl and all ...
but , i think i love you .
wait a second .
look , i've been trying to keep this whole thing in perspective .
you just said you loved me .
if i say i love you , throw caution to the wind ... ... let the chips fall as they may , and you're lying , i'll fucking die .
i'm not lying to you .
and i swear from this moment forth ... ... l will never lie to you again .
well , hello , mrs. worley .
how do you do , mr. worley .
top of the morning to you , mrs. worley .
bottom of the ninth , mr. worley .
by the way , have you seen your lovely wife today?
my beautiful , charming , sexy wife ... ... mrs. alabama worley?
are there any others , mr. worley?
no , not for me , no .
no .
no .
yes , yes .
excuse me .
do you think you could turn down the heat just a teeny bit?
i must ask you a question .
who and what is a drexl?
quiet .
huh?
he was my pimp .
you had a pimp?
i was a call girl .
call girls have pimps .
was he black?
he thinks he is .
he said his mama was an apache but i suspect he's lying .
is he nice?
i wouldn't go so far as to say that .
he treated me pretty decent .
i was only there for four days .
he got a little bit rough the other day .
what do you mean?
with you?
no , with my friend llene .
what did he do to llene?
slapped her around .
kicked her in the stomach .
it was scary .
this motherfucker sounds beautiful .
what did you do to end up with a son of a bitch like that?
what are you talking about?
floyd say he don't be eating pussy .
drexl , any nigger says he don't eat pussy's lying his ass off .
i heard that .
hold on a second .
big d. , you saying you eat pussy?
yeah , motherfucker , i eat the pussy , i eat the bud .
i eat every fucking thing .
if i ever did eat any pussy , i would never eat any pussy , right?
but if i did eat some pussy ... ... l sure as hell wouldn't tell no goddamn body .
i'd be ashamed as a motherfucker .
shit , nigger , you smoke enough sherm ... ... your dumb ass would do a lot of motherfucking things .
you'd be up in there suckin 'niggers 'dicks !
fuck you guys , man .
you guys are fucked up , all right?
hey .
wait a second .
we's just fucking with you .
in fact , i'm going to show you what i mean with a little demonstration .
toss me the burner .
all right , dig this .
pretend it's that fine centerfold bitch .
you know what i'm saying?
and you are you .
honey , where you going?
bathroom .
well , can you live with it?
what?
i said can you live with it?
live with what?
that son of a bitch walking around breathing the same air as you .
getting away with it every day .
are you haunted?
yeah .
you want to get un haunted?
oh , yeah .
well , i'd kill him .
shoot him in the face .
put him down like a dog .
i can't believe what you're saying .
i'm not saying nothing .
i's just saying what i'd do .
you'd do that?
the fuck don't deserve to live .
look , he's haunting me , you know .
i want to kill him , but i don't want to spend the rest of my life in jail .
hey man , i don't blame you .
if i thought i'd get away with it ...
get away with it?
killing is the hard part .
getting away with it , that's easy .
you think a cop gives a fuck about a pimp?
listen .
every pimp in the world could get shot .
two in the back of the fucking head .
cops would throw a party , man .
as long as you're not at the scene of the crime ... ... with a smoking gun in your hand , you'll get away with it .
clarence , i like you .
always have , always will .
'bama .
where you going?
i need you to write down your former address .
why?
so i can go over there and pick up your stuff , that's why .
oh , baby , come on , clarence .
i just want to disappear from there .
i know this scares the shit out of you , but i'm not scared of that motherfucker .
you are completely out of his reach .
he poses absolutely no threat to you .
if he doesn't matter , and he doesn't ... ... then it seems silly you lose all your things now .
listen .
you don't know him .
no , you don't know me .
not when it comes to shit like this .
i need to do this .
i want you to know that you can count on me to protect you .
come on , please just write it down .
this isn't a good idea .
i'm telling you , it'll be fine .
i'll be in and out of there .
be careful .
i will .
i love you .
i love you , too .
you want something?
yeah , you drexl?
no man , i'm marty .
well , i want to talk to drexl .
well , what the fuck you want to talk to him about?
it's about alabama .
he was asking about alabama .
where the fuck is that bitch?
she's with me .
who the fuck are you?
i'm her husband .
well , that makes us practically related .
have a seat , boy .
have an egg roll .
we got everything here ... ... from " little eye joel " to " damned if i know .
no , thanks .
no , thanks?
what that mean?
i think you're too scared to be eating .
now , see ...
we're sitting down here , ready to negotiate .
and you've already given up your shit .
i'm still a mystery to you .
but i know exactly where your white ass is coming from .
if i ask you if you want some dinner and you grab an egg roll ... ... l say , he's acting like he ain't got a care in the world .
and who knows?
maybe he don't .
maybe this fool is such a bad motherfucker ... ... he don't have to worry about nothing .
he just sits down ... ... and watches my motherfucking tv .
see?
you haven't even sat down yet .
that tv over there , since you've been here ... ... has a woman with her breast just hanging out .
well , you haven't even bothered to look .
you just been clocking me .
now , i know i'm pretty .
but i'm not as pretty as a couple of titties .
this child be fierce .
i'm not eating because i'm not hungry .
i'm not sitting because i'm not staying .
i'm not looking at the movie because i've already seen it seven years ago .
it is the mack .
max julian , carol speed and richard pryor .
i'm not scared of you .
i just don't like you .
that's payoff money .
alabama is moving on to greener pastures .
we're not negotiating , i don't like to barter .
what's in there is for my peace of mind .
my peace of mind is worth that much .
not one penny more .
it's empty .
marty , you know what we got here?
a motherfucking charlie bronson .
mr. majestyk?
look here , charlie .
none of this bullshit is necessary .
i don't got no hold over alabama .
i was just trying to lend a girl a helping hand .
that's what you get .
you fuck with me , white boy !
look at this !
you fond of my motherfucking freaks?
shit !
you motherfucker !
your ass got to be crazy !
you must have thought it was white boy day .
it ain't white boy day , is it?
no man , it ain't white boy day .
shit man , you done fucked up again .
well , well , well .
look what we got here .
clarence worley?
it sounds almost like a nigger name .
and i know where you live .
4900 , 160th street ... ... apartment 48 .
and i would make a million dollar bet , that alabama is at the same address .
marty , take the car , go get her .
bring her dumb ass back here .
i think i'll keep lover boy here entertained .
hey , marty !
what the fuck are you doing?
i can't find my jacket !
go look in the fucking hamper .
you !
get a bag and put alabama's things in it .
you want to get fucking shot?
get a bag and put alabama's things in it !
i just did you the biggest fucking favor of your life !
open your eyes .
i said open your fucking eyes !
you thought it was pretty fucking funny .
didn't you?

you piece of shit !

l was selfish .
i know i was selfish .
i was , but ...
... l was carrying your child , babe .
i killed him .
want a hamburger or something?
i'm starving to death .
is this a joke?
no joke .
that was the best fucking hamburger i ever had in my life .
i've never had a hamburger taste this good .
come on , eat something , you'll feel better .
what the fuck you crying for?
he's not worth one of your tears .
would you rather it have been me?
is that it? ls that what you want?
i mean , do you love him?
do you love him?
i said , do you fucking love him?
i think what you did was ...
what?
i think what you did ...
what? ... was so romantic .
oh , baby , you're bleeding .
i got your things right here .
clean clothes .
i love you .
i love you .
there is a god .
these aren't my clothes .
rommel , where are you?

i haven't exactly been doing a lot of entertaining ... ... of company as of late .
i'm sorry if i seem a little tense .
but you're the last person in the world , that i expected to see this morning .
well , that's okay , daddy , i tend to have that effect on people .
you got anything to drink around here?
i'm dying of thirst .
now there should be , there should be a seven up in there .
anything stronger?
probably not .
beer .
you can drink beer , can't you?
i can , but i don't .
that's about all i ever eat .
excuse me .
hello , hello , hello .
i'm his father .
well that's all right .

you want some beer?
if you want some , it'll be here .
okay?
where is a liquor store around here?
there is a party store down 54th street .

hard to tell you what to get .
different places have different things .
here , that should cover it , okee dokee?
okee dokee , doggy daddy .
ain't she the sweetest goddamn thing you ever saw in your whole life?
i mean , is she a four alarm fire , or what?
she seems very nice .
nice?
daddy , " nice " is not the word .
i mean this girl , she's a peach .
you know , she even tastes like a peach .
you can tell i'm in love with her , can't you?
no , wait .
i gotta talk .
sit down !
shut up !
you give me a fucking headache .
you are so much like your mother , i can't believe it .
you are your fucking mother , through and through .
i haven't heard from you in three years .
you show up all of a sudden , at 8 : 00 in the morning ... ... you walk in here like a goddamned bulldozer .
now don't get me wrong .
i love you , i'm glad to see you .
but slow it down , man .
all right?
now .
when did you get married?
well , daddy ...
i'm in big fucking trouble .
i really need your help .
no , no , stop talking .
what do you want from me?
what?
what do you want from me?
stop acting like an infant !
you're here because you want me to help you .
what do you need from me?
you need money?
no .
you still have friends on the force?
yes , i still have friends on the force .
could you find out if they know about us?
i don't think they know shit .
but i want to know for sure .
you can do that .
right?
what makes you think i could do that?
because you were a cop .
but what makes you think that i would do that?
because i'm your son .
oh , you're my son .
oh , you got it all worked out , don't you?
look .
i mean , goddamn , i've never asked you for a goddamn thing .
jesus fucking christ !
after mom divorced you ... ... did i ever ask you for anything?
no .
i didn't .
when i wouldn't see you for one or two years ... ... did i ever get into your shit?
the whole time you were drunk , did i get mad ... ... point my finger?
no !
i never did .
everybody else did , but i didn't !
now look , i just need help , and you can fucking help me .
all right?
now , i'm basically a resourceful guy .
if i didn't really need it , i wouldn't ask .
i mean , if you want to say no , then fine .
forget it , don't worry about it .
no problem , i'm gone , all right?
the virgin is back !
thank god .
i could eat a horse .
i didn't get you any chicken .

now .
the part you'll be reading is one of the bad guys .
there's brian and marty .
who?
is there a problem?
no .
peter breck has been cast in the part of brian .
so , you'll be reading for the role of marty .
in this scene , you're both in a car , and bill shatner's hanging on the hood .
what you want to do is get him off .
all right , i'm marty .
ready?
i'm driving .
okay .
where the fuck did he come from?
i don't know , he just appeared like magic .

thank you .
thank you .
we'll let you know .

here comes the train .
well , they found nothing .

drug related?
why drug related?
well , apparently drexl had his big toe stuck in that shit .
really?
drexl had an association with a fellow named blue lou boyle .
name mean anything to you?
no .
if you don't hang around his circle , it shouldn't .
who is he?
gangster , drug dealer .
you don't want him on your ass .
now look , clarence , the more i hear about this drexl fucker ... ... the more i think you did the right thing .
this guy was not just some wild flake .
that's what i was trying to tell you before .
the guy was like a mad dog .
so , the cops , they don't think ...
they're not after us?
no .
until they hear something better .
they will just assume drexl had a falling out with blue lou .
and once you leave town , i wouldn't even worry about it .
thanks , thanks a lot , daddy .
you really came through for me .
i got some money i could give you .
no , keep it .

the man your son stole from .
i hear you were once a cop , so i can assume you have heard of us before .

we're going to have a little q and a.
and at the risk of sounding redundant , please ... ... make your answers genuine .

i can imagine how painful this must be for you .
but clarence ... ... and his bitch of a girlfriend , brought this on themselves .
i implore you not to go down that road with them .
you could always take comfort in the fact you never had a choice .
i'd like to help you if i could ... ... but i haven't seen clarence .
you see that?
that smarts doesn't it?
to get slammed in the nose .
fucks you up .
you get the pain shooting through your brain ... ... your eyes fill up with water .
it's not any kind of fun .
but , what i have to offer you , that's as good as it's going to get .
and it won't ever get that good again .
we talked to your neighbors .
they saw a cadillac .
purple cadillac .
clarence's purple cadillac , parked in front of your trailer yesterday .
mr. worley .
have you seen your son?
i've seen him .
i can't be sure of how much he told you .
in the chance you're in the dark about some of this ... ... let me shed some light .
that whore your boy hangs around with ...
her pimp is an associate of mine .
along with other affairs he works for me in a courier capacity .
well , apparently ... ... that dirty whore found out we were going to do some business ... ... because your son , the cowboy and his flame , came into the room blazing ... ... and didn't stop , until they were pretty sure everybody was dead .
what are you talking about?
i'm talking about a massacre .
they snatched my narcotics .
hightailed it out of there .
would have got away with it .
but your son , fuckhead that he is ... ... left his driver's license in the dead guy's hand .
you know .
i don't believe you .
that's of minor importance .
what's of major fucking importance is that i believe you .
where did they go?
on their honeymoon .
i'm getting angry asking the same question a second time .
where did they go?
they didn't tell me .
now wait a minute and listen to me .
i haven't seen clarence in three years .
he shows up yesterday ... ... with a young girl , saying that he got married .
he asked for some quick cash ... ... to go on a honeymoon .
he asked me if he could borrow $ 500 .
i felt like helping him .
so , i wrote him out a check .
we went to breakfast in the morning .
and that's the last i saw of him ... ... so help me god .
they never thought to tell me where they were going .
and i never thought to ask .
vincenzo , sir .
there's nothing there .
that's not good .
you know .
sicilians are great liars .
the best in the world .
i'm sicilian ... ... my father was the world heavyweight champion of sicilian liars .
from growing up with him , i learned the pantomime .
there are 17 different things a guy can do when he lies ... ... to give himself away .
a guy has got 17 pantomimes .
woman has got 20 .
guy has got 17 .
but ... ... if you know them , like you know your own face ... ... they would beat lie detectors all to hell .
now what we got here is a game of " show and tell .
you don't want to show me nothing .
but you're telling me everything .
i know you know where they are .
so , tell me ... ... before i do some damage you won't walk away from .
could i have one of those chesterfields now?
sure .
you got a ... ... match?
no wait .
don't bother , i got one .
you're sicilian , huh?
yeah , sicilian .
you know ...
i read a lot .
especially things about history .
i find that shit fascinating .
here's a fact , whether you know it or not .
sicilians were spawned by niggers .
come again?
it's a fact .
yeah .
you see ... ... sicilians have black blood pumping through their hearts .
and if you don't believe me , you can look it up .
hundreds and hundreds of years ago , you see ... ... the moors conquered sicily .
and the moors are niggers .
you see , way back then ... ... sicilians were like wops from northern ltaly .
they all had blond hair and blue eyes .
but , well ...
then the moors moved in there ... ... they changed the whole country .
they did so much fucking with sicilian women .
that they changed the whole bloodline forever .
that is why blond hair , blue eyes ... ... became black hair and dark skin .
you know it's absolutely amazing to me ... ... to think to this day ... ... hundreds of years later ... ... that sicilians ... ... still carry that nigger gene .
now this ...
no , i am quoting history .
it's written , it's a fact .
it's written .
i love this guy !
your ancestors are niggers .
hey !
and your great , great , great ... ... great grandmother fucked a nigger .
and she had a half nigger kid .
now ... ... if that is a fact , tell me?
am i lying?
'cause you ... ... you are part eggplant .
egg !
egg !
egg !
you are a cantaloupe .
that was beautiful .
i haven't killed anybody ... ... since 1984 .
go to this comedian's son's apartment .
come back with something that tells me where that asshole went .
so i can wipe this egg off my face .
fix this fucked up family for good .
hey , boss .
get ready to be happy .
'morning , everybody .
it's 6 : 22 here in la .
i'm david perry at kblu .
hello?
floyd .
can't you answer the door at least for me?
oh , man , i didn't even hear it .
hello?
can't you help me every now and then?
yes .
you call for a date?
huh?
i knew it was you !
dick , this is alabama .
alabama , this is dick .
nice to meet you !
how long have you lived here?
i'm alabama .
you look good !
this is a great place .
i'm starving .
let's get something to eat .
who's this?
this is floyd .
let's go !
come on !
hey .
hey .
i didn't tell you guys yet?
i had this really , really good audition for t. j. hooker the other day .
you're going to be on t. j. hooker?
yeah , the new t. j. hooker .
knock on wood .
you get to meet captain kirk?
you don't meet him in the audition ... ... but if i get the part , hope , hope ...
that would be amazing .
it'd be cool ...
meeting captain kirk , that would be cool .
here we are .
the honeymoon suite .
you're really in love , aren't you?
for the very first time in my life .
know what that's like?
no .
no .
shut the fuck up .
what are you doing in la anyway , huh?
holy mary , mother of god .
this shit can't be real .
it'll get you high .
what?
i said , it'll get you high .
hey , we got cable .
want some wine , sweetheart?
yeah , just a little bit , i'm not much of a wine gal .
that stuff is fucking real .
this is fucking real , clarence .
i certainly hope so .
you've got a hell of a lot of cocaine here , man .
i know .
do you realize how much coke you have?
no , tell me .
i don't know , but it's a fucking lot !
this is drexl's coke .
no , drexl is dead , you see .
it's clarence's coke .
and he can do whatever he wants with it .
what clarence wants to do is to sell it .
then , we'll jump on a plane and spend the rest of our lives spending it .
you got my letter?
you lined up a buyer for me?
i'm not joe cocaine , okay?
you're an actor .
i hear these hollywood guys get it delivered to the set .
well , they do .
all right?
they do .
maybe one day , when i'm a successful actor ... ... l'll be like one of them .
but , until that day , i don't have anything .
all right?
i don't have a pot to piss in , or a window to throw it out .
all i got is fucking floyd .
if you want me to help you sell a bit at a time that's all i can do .
no .
none of that bit at a time shit .
it's got to be the whole enchilada in one shot .
clarence , do you have any idea how difficult that'll be?
what the fuck you are talking about?
i'm offering $ 500, 000 worth of white for $ 200, 000 .
that'll be difficult?
very difficult .
that's very difficult , understand?
listen .
it's difficult because you're selling to a particular group , understand?
fat cats , big shots .
guys who can afford $ 200, 000 .
guys who can use a whole suitcase full of cocaine .
basically , clarence , guys i don't know .
and guys you don't know .
and more importantly , they don't know you .
come on , dick .
okay , clarence .
listen .
there's one guy that i know ... ... that can help you out , clarence , but ... ... l'm not guaranteeing you anything .
is he big league?
he's not big league .
okay?
but he works as an assistant to a very big movie producer named lee donowitz .
lee donowitz could afford ... ... and can use , $ 200, 000 worth of coke .
being that that's what you have .
all right , so what did you tell him?
what the fuck do you expect me to tell him?
i didn't know what was bullshit and what wasn't .
and besides , floyd smoked the second page of the letter .
okay?
what's this acting class guy's name?
elliot .
elliot what?
elliot blitzer .
we'll get him on the phone and arrange a meeting ... ... so we can get through all this getting to know you stuff , all right?
where?
where should we meet?
roller coaster .
roller coasters .
so , you have $ 500, 000 worth of cola that you are unloading for $ 200, 000 .
you want an animal cracker?
thanks .
wait , save the gorillas .
thanks .
so , you got ... ... $ 500, 000 worth of cola ... ... that you're unloading for $ 200, 000 .
unloading . " that's a hell of a way to describe a bargain of a lifetime .
where did you get it?
where did i get it?
i grow it on my windowsill .
the light is really good there .
i'm up high enough off the street so , you know , you can't see it .
it works perfectly .
yeah .
where , really , where does it come from?
where does it come from?
coco leaves .
you're sick .
i'm out of here .
elliot , chill out .
come on , sit down here .
all right?
we're here , so let's enjoy the ride .
i'll tell you .
you have to promise you'll keep it quiet .
if dick hadn't told me you're good people , i'd say it's none of your business .
this is going to be fun .
let's go !
i got a friend in the department .
what department?
what department?
what do you think , eight ball?
the police department?
give the man a prize !
about a year and a half ago ... ... my friend got access to the evidence room .
he snagged this coke , but he's a good cop with a family .
he had it for a year and a half 'til he found a guy he could trust .
and he trusts you?
he trusts me , we were in 4 h together .
we've known each other since childhood .
i handle sales , he's my silent partner .
he knows , if i get fucked up , i won't drop dime on him .
okay?
no further , you understand?
he's kind of paranoid , i didn't tell you nothing .
you didn't hear anything .
i didn't hear anything .
all right !
here we go !
ride it out , baby !
yeah !
we're going in for another one !
hang on , elliot !
oh , yeah , we got this puppy .
this was a good idea .
elliot looks a little green .
do i look like a beautiful blond with big tits and an ass ... ... that tastes like french vanilla ice cream?
what?
i said , do i look like a beautiful blond with big tits and an ass ... ... that tastes like french vanilla ice cream?
no .
no .
then why are you telling me this bullshit?
what , do you want to fuck me?
clarence .
he's sick , man .
let me handle this , all right?
look .
you know what?
just get it straight .
lee is not into taking risks , okay?
he's got a couple of guys , he's been dealing with them for years .
they're reliable , they're dependable , and they're safe .
riddle me this , batman .
if you're so much in love , what are you doing here?
i'm sure you've got better things to do than hanging around on a roller coaster .
your guy is interested because with that much shit ... ... he could play joe fucking hollywood until the wheels come off .
he can sell it , he can snort it ... ... he can play santa claus with it .
at the price he's paying he'll be able to throw it around .
he'll be everybody's best friend .
i'm not putting him down .
it's his money , let him do what he wants .
but don't expect us to hang around ... ... waiting for you guys to grow some guts , all right?
jesus .
yeah , hello .
hi , lee .
elliot , it's sunday .
can you tell me why i'm talking to you on sunday?
don't i see enough of you all week?
i'm with that party that you wanted me to get together with , lee .
you know who i'm talking about?
i don't believe this .
why are you talking to me ... ... on my phone about that?
well , because i'm standing with the guy , and he insists on talking to you .
what , are you out of your fucking mind?
he said that if i didn't get you on the phone , that he would leave ...
hello , lee , it's clarence .
at last , we speak .
first , i want to tell you i'm a big fan of yours .
that's why i want to open dr. zhivago in la .
and i need you and your abilities to distribute it .
i don't know .
dr. zhivago is a pretty big movie .
the biggest movie you've dealt with .
we're talking a lot of film here .
a man would be an idiot not to be a little cautious about a movie like that .
and , lee , you're no idiot .
i'm not saying i'm not interested .
it's just , being a distributor is not what i do .
i'm a movie producer , you know?
i'm here to make good movies , nothing more ... ... and nothing , well , maybe less , sometimes .
hey !
choose a fucking lane !
not you , just an idiot ...
don't give me the finger !
i'll fucking have you killed !
so , bottom line is i'm not paramount .
you know what i'm saying?
i got a select few distributors .
i buy their little movies and i accomplish what i want and i get out of there .
very business like , very easy , and very little risk .
we're talking dr. zhivago .
it'll be packing them in .
for a year ... ... two years you won't have to deal with anybody else's movie but mine .
nobody's but yours .
well , what's the rush here?
i want to be able to announce the deal at cannes .
if i had time for a courtship , i would .
i'd take you out , hold your hand , kiss your cheek .
but i'm not in that position .
i need to know right now if you and i are in bed together or not .
if you want my movie , you must come to terms ... ... with your fear and desire .
fear and desire , huh , clarence?
don't you know that my films have grossed more than $ 2 . 8 billion?
let me talk to elliot .
you want to talk to elliot?
let me talk to elliot .
elliot .
he wants to talk to you .
hi , lee .
elliot , where do you know this guy from?
he's a friend of dick's , remember?
who the fuck is dick?
you want me to suck his dick?
who the fuck is dick?
oh , who the fuck is dick?
yeah .
my friend .
he's in my acting class .
you told him i'm an actor?
is he any good?
ls he talented , or ...
really?
how does dick know this guy?
they grew up together .
okay , wednesday at the hotel , 3 : 00 .
bring the whole fucking cast .
elliot , don't call me here anymore , especially not on sunday , all right?
what did he say?
just hold on .
shut up for a second .
hey , you guys .
this is what's going to happen .
three o'clock , beverly ambassador , he wants to see everybody .
okay?
and , he'll talk to you .
if after talking to you he likes you ... ... he'll deal with you .
if he doesn't , he'll say , " fuck you , " and walk out of the room .
did you tell him i was a ...
shut up .
and he wants a sample bag .
no problem on all counts .
great .
did you tell him i was an actor?
yes , i told him .
you told him i was good?
yeah , i lied .
hi .
how are you doing?
oh , pretty good .
dick?
dick richie?
no .
no , he's not here right now .
you live here?
yes , i do .
you're sort of roommates?
exactly .
maybe you can help me , i'm looking for a friend .
sure .
clarence worley from detroit?
he's hanging with a pretty girl named alabama?
yeah , i know them .
they've been by here .
you've seen them?
yes .
are they staying here?
no , they're staying at the ... ... safari motor , motel lnn .
safari motel .
safari motel .
yes .
how do you know that?
i mean , have you been over there?
no , they were here , and they said they were going to go there .
then they went .

alabama , you were perfect .

like a ninja .
i'm going to go grab us something to eat .
i'll go jump in the tub and get all wet , and slippery , and soapy .
and hop onto that waterbed .
and watch x rated movies ... ... until you get your ass back into my loving arms .

i'm sorry , i think you have the wrong room .
my name is sadie .
we don't have any coke , but there's a pepsi machine down the hall .
i don't know anybody named clarence .
perhaps my husband does .
you can ask him because he'll be home in a minute .
he plays football .
he's just at practice .
give me your hand .
okay .
you are unbelievably cute .
thank you .
thanks .
let me see those eyes .
what a face .
do me a favor .
turn around for me .
okay .
no , go the other way .
okay .
that hurts , don't it?
get on your feet , sweetie .
you ain't hurt that bad .
now , where's our coke?
where's clarence?
and when's he comin 'back?
okay .

i hadn't .
that's probably the best piece i've read on elvis presley in my entire life .
look at this .
see , it tries to pin down ... ... what the attraction is after all these years .
it covers the whole spectrum .
talks to the fans ... ... people who grew up with him and love his music .
then , there's the fanatics .
right?
i don't know about you , but they give me the creeps .
yeah , yeah , i see what you mean .
i mean , look at her .
looks like she fell off the ugly tree and hit every branch on the way down .
now the first time you kill somebody , that's the hardest .
i don't give a shit if you're fuckin 'wired up , or jack the ripper .
remember that guy in texas?
the guy up in that fucking tower , killed all them people?
i bet you green money , the first little black dot he took a beat on ... ... that was the bitch of the bunch .
first one is tough .
no fucking fooling .
the second one ain't no fuckin 'mardi gras ... ... but it's better than the first 'cause you still feel the same thing ... ... except it's more diluted .
you know , it's better .
i threw up on the first one , you believe that?
then the third one .
the third one is easy , you level right off .
that's no problem .

hey , you got caught .
it's all fun until you get caught .
now we got you .
okay , mr. elliot , fucking actor , you just made the big time .
you're no longer an extra ...
a bit player . ... a supporting actor .
you're a fucking star .
you'll be playing your one man show ... ... nightly for the next two fucking years !
for a captive audience .
you'll get out in a few years and meet some old lady .
you'll marry and be understanding to your wife's needs ... ... because you'll know what it's like to be a woman .
you'll only want to fuck her ass 'cause her pussy won't be tight enough .
good point , detective .
right?
fucking faggot !
krinkle , this is it , and it's all ours .
i mean , talk about falling into something ...
would you shut up !
i can't understand shit .
what happened?
what are you talking about?
okay , all right .
patrol car pulls a guy over for speeding .
suspect is covered with coke ... ... so they bring him to me and nicholson .
nicholson and l .
what's the difference?
we go to work on him .
we know something is strange 'cause he ... ... is fucking stupid , and he's got a big bag of coke , and it's uncut .
and you won't believe what he's got to say .
seems a cop from some department , stole ... ... $ 500, 000 worth of coke from the property cage ...
he sat on the shit for a year and a half .
now , the cop's got this weirdo ...
suspect's words . ... to front for him .
our guy , elliot blitzer , is making a deal between them and his boss ... ... big time fucking movie producer named lee donowitz .
he did coming home in a body bag .
a vietnam movie?
yeah .
good fucking movie .
fucking a. great fucking movie .
so , do you believe him?
i believe he believes him .
this guy is too rattled to be lying .
he'd roll over on his mom , dad , his two pantied granny ... ... and the king of siam if he had anything on him .
this guy was a sissy .
this rabbit will do anything not to do any time .
you know what he'll do?
he'll wear a wire .
he'll wear a wire?
he'll wear a wire , we talked to him .
dirty cops , we got to get lnternal affairs on this .
i don't care who you bring in .
you can bring in the state enlisted ... ... the ghost of steve mcqueen , ten roman gladiators .
i don't give a shit as long as me and todd get credit for the bust .
listen , we found him .
we just want the fucking collar .
that's it .
end of story .
you got it .
did i ever tell you how much i hate airports?
see , i used to live by one back in dearborn , you know .
really frustrating living next to an airport when you don't got shit .
and all day long i'm seeing and hearing people doing exactly ... ... what i want to be doing , but couldn't .
what?
starting new lives , leaving detroit , vacations , business trips ... ... fun , fun , fun .
knowing us , we can jump on any of those planes ... ... and go anywhere we want .
gives me a whole new outlook .
love how it works out .
you're not kidding .
we got lives to start over .
we should go somewhere where we can start from scratch .
i've been in america all my life .
i'd like to see what tv in other countries is like .
where do you think we should go , my little turtle dove?
cancn .
cancn , why cancn?
it's got a nice ring to it .
sounds like a movie .
clarence and alabama go to cancn , don't you think?
in my movie , darling , you get top billing .
don't worry about nothing , all right?
it's all going to work out for us .
we deserve it .
you sure that's how you get to the beverly ambassador?
yeah , man , i'm positive .
let me tell you , if we get lost that's your ass .
why don't you get out of my beer and get a fucking job?
yeah , okay .

you do that , and you got to show in court , beyond any reasonable doubt ... ... that this respectable man in the hollywood community ... ... is dealing cocaine .
we must prove it , and you must do it .
that's what we're doing here .
you're going to be okay , you won't get hurt .

you should be careful .
i should .
what the fuck did you bring that for?
in case .
in case of what?
i don't know , what do you want me to say?
look , clarence , lee donowitz is not a pimp .
i know that , but one thing this week has taught me ... ... it's better to have a gun and not need it than to need a gun and not have it .
there he is .
elliot , your motivation is to stay out of jail .
easy , easy , easy .

it's a helicopter .
sorry , it's nothing personal .
clarence .
there'll be no need to search me , daredevil .
all you'll find is this right here .
now what compelled you to bring that along?
the same thing that compelled you guys ... ... to bring heavy artillery to a business meeting .
i'll take that .
well , you're going to have to .
oh .
hi .
everybody's here .
elliot .
who's who?
that's dick on the end there .

clarence on the end .

mr. donowitz?

lee .
boris , shut the fuck up !
come on , everybody , don't be shy .
come on in .
okay , lee?
lee .
lee .
that's right , lee .
i just gotta tell you , i really am a big fan .
coming home ln a body bag is my favorite movie .
after apocalypse now , i think it's the best vietnam movie ever made .
wow .
thank you very much , clarence .
lee .
what?
this guy is packing .
really .
well , i mean , i've been pretty scared about this whole thing .
i'm fairly confident you're here to do business , so look .
i don't want to be a wise guy .
if you want , i'll lay my gun on the table .
it's up to you .
no , i don't think that's necessary .
boris , be nice .
make everybody some coffee .
okay?
a pleasure to meet you .
nice to meet you , too .
honey , sit down .
relax , relax .
elliot , you look like shit .
oh , i'm sorry .
i mean , it's completely disgusting .
if i could get a quick signature , it would be great .
whatever bonnie wants .
like my dailies , there , clar?
is that what these are?
you like them?
they're great .
they better be , they cost me enough .
what did that day cost me?
$ 357, 000 .
elliot , i swear to god , somebody is stealing from me .
what's this one called , anyway?
it's a sequel to body bag .
really?
we don't have a title yet , but what does joe like?
body bags two .
oh .
that's imaginative .
i've got more taste in my penis .
this guy is really fucking funny .
most of these movies that win a lot of oscars , i can't stand them .
they're safe , geriatric , coffee table dog shit , you know?
we park our cars in the same garage .
it's all right .
all they make are unwatchable movies from unreadable books .
mad max , that's a movie .
the good the bad and the ugly ... ... rio bravo , those are movies .
and coming home in a body bag , that was a movie .
it was the only movie that won oscars with balls ... ... l mean , since deerhunter .
i don't believe you .
what , do you like a little coffee with your sugar , or what?
lee , i'm not satisfied until the spoon stands straight up .
give me a coffee , will you?
my uncle roger and my uncle jerry , who were in nam ... ... saw coming home in a body bag .
they said that's the most accurate vietnam film ... ... they had ever seen .
i'll tell you .
when veterans in that war say that about my project ... ... it makes the whole thing worthwhile .
here's to you .
my friend , oops , i just met you .
you know why?
i think because we got the same interests .
and you know what i'd like to do right now?
i'd like to see dr. zhivago .
where is it?
is there a fucking doctor in the house , or what?
hang on a second .
when you see this , you are going to shit .
l better .
what's the guy's name?
donowitz .
lee , that's all practically uncut .
if you so desire ... ... you can cut that a lot more .
don't worry , i'll desire .
get me another cup of coffee , will you?
me , too , boris .
i have to hand it to you , clarence , this is not nose garbage .
this is quality stuff .
perfect merchandise .
the only trouble is ... ... when i'm offered a deal that's too good to be true ... ... it's because it's a lie .
convince me you're on the level .
convince him .
if he don't bite , we have nothing but possession .
we got lots of sandwich shit back there , make something .
we got pastrami , nice rye ...
anybody want anything?
you , got any aspirin?
yeah , sure .
get him that .
well , lee , it's like this .
you're getting this bargain because i don't know what i'm doing .
you're used to dealing with professionals which i'm not .
i'm a rank amateur .
what the fuck is going on?
what's going on , joe?
i can take that , sell it a little at a time ... ... and make a hell of a lot more money .
what's going on , joe?
elliot's too far away .
look , this is the whole ball game , this is the fucking ball game !
i'm not saying that you're a drug dealer , but you're a fucking movie producer .
and you got access to all kinds of money and shit like that .
shit .
oh , joe ...
... you are fucking killing me .
wait , wait .
there , wait , quiet .
now , i can't get a million for it , but you can .
so i'll sell it to you for $ 200, 000 .
you go make a million with it .
shit , it's all found money to me anyway , you know?
there he is .
me and my wife , we're minimum wage kids , you know? $ 200, 000 .
it means the world to us .
elliot tells me that you're fronting for a dirty cop .
elliot wasn't supposed to tell you anything .
he's not a dirty cop , he's a good cop .
he saw his chance and he took it , that's all .
why does he trust you?
well , we grew up together , that's why .
if you don't know shit , then why does he think that you can sell it?
i bullshitted him .
you're nuts !
he's a wild man , this kid , clarence .
i like him .
you're wild , i love it .
hey , lee .
i love this guy , he bullshitted him , you believe this kid?
i love him .
elliot , i love this kid .
monty , get the money .
that's it , fellas , let's get these son of a bitches .
now wait , wait .
i completely forgot , excuse me .
what's your part in this again?
i'm his wife .
oh , you're the wife , right .
clarence , clarence .
what , did you beat her?
no , she got that playing basketball .
what's the matter with you?
i'm sorry .
why are you here?
i'm an actor .
dick , if you were just a fucking actor , you would never have got in the room .
i'm friends with elliot .
he's your friend?
you got problems .
all right .
it's all right .
elliot knows me .
elliot , here .
call joe and tell him that the production manager reports ... ... he's taking 30 cents of every dollar ... ... and putting it in his pocket .
don't you want to count your money?
no , she can count it .
i'm going to the bathroom .
give it to her .
i gotta hand it to you , clarence .

you're saying what he wants to hear .
that ain't the same as kissing his ass .
i saw coming home in a body bag , i loved it , i'm not lying to him .

amid the chaos of that day ... ... when all i could hear was the thunder of gunshots ... ... and all i could smell was the violence in the air ... ... l look back and am amazed ... ... that my thoughts were so clear and true .
that three words went through my mind endlessly .
repeating themselves like a broken record .
you're so cool .
you're so cool .
you're so cool .
and sometimes clarence asks me what would i have done if he had died .
lf that bullet had been two inches more to the left .
to this , i always smile .
as if i'm not going to satisfy him with a response .
but i always do .
l tell him of how i would want to die .
but that the anguish and the want of death would fade ... ... like the stars at dawn .
and that things would be much like they are now .
perhaps .
except maybe i wouldn't have named our son ... ... elvis .
