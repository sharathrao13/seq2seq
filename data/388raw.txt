agua .
as in water .
cute .
but i wasn't here for cute .
i was here 'cause i'd gotten a call for my regular fee . $ 4 . 99 .
i'm an ex secret agent .
my name is juni cortez .
and i'm a private detective .
a p. i. a private eye .
a gumshoe .
i know why the water from your park is missing .
pray tell .
it's winter .
they shut down the park during the winter .
who's " they "?
the people who really own this park .
times are tough .
but a guy's gotta do what he's gotta do .
from saving cats in trees ... ... to finding lost toys .
to helping people ...
hold on .
yeah?
the oss is looking for me?
look , i'm no longer an agent .
i can't help you .
whatever it is , it's your problem .
leave me alone !
i'd been burned by the agency .
the oss .
so i left .
no going back .
i handle my own assignments now .
smaller in scale .
i was saving up for something big .
i was standing in line to buy my copy of the biggest virtual reality game in history .
it goes online at midnight .
pretty exciting .
i suppose .
game over .
the biggest video game to ever be created .
period .
this is a worldwide event .
the game was created by someone known only as the toymaker .
who was once again unavailable for interviews .
but there's gotta be some things more important than games .
oh .
and did we mention the surprises the toymaker has in store for those of you that complete level five?
untold riches .
toys .
and prizes beyond your wildest dreams .
hey , no cutting in line , freak .
i wasn't cutting .
i was standing right here !
end of the line !
needless to say .
things have been pretty lame since i left the oss .
aah !
things were about to get worse .
dear juni .
i was doing some work and thought you might like these .
miniaturized sharks .
remember .
they're still man eaters .
so don't be poking your fingers in the bowl .
take care .
if you guys ever need anything .
i'll be there .
romero .
ralph , write a thank you note back to romero .
behave , you guys .
no fighting .
whatcha doin '?
hi , gerti .
i'm just doing nothing ... again .
what's that?
mexican chocolate .
where's your mom and dad?
on an assignment .
it was my idea not to be part of the family business .
they're all on missions .
your sister , too , huh?
i haven't seen carmen since christmas ... last year .
you should join back up .
the oss could really use you .
yeah .
use me .
not what i meant .
don't hold on to the past , juni .
look at me .
9 years old and nowhere to go but up .
the only tribe worth belonging to is the one that you're born into .
yeah , your family .
it's good to take care of your family .
but remember one thing .
everyone's your family .
that makes no sense .
hello , juni .
mr. president .
oh , you can call me devlin .
weren't you already running the country when you were head of the oss?
i was running the country .
but since the oss is a secret organization , no one knew it .
i wanted the world to know that i was in charge .
so i became president of the united states .
it all depends upon your preference .
reality or perception .
perception works for me .
well , i'm into reality .
and the reality is , nothing you can say will make me rejoin the oss .
that is why you called , isn't it?
the oss needs you to return .
i'm retired .
well , who's living in perception now?
the fact is there is no retirement .
once an agent , always an agent .
it's time for you to be a big boy and reinstate .
with all due respect , sir , no .
your sister's missing .
taking agent cortez to games and theory .
that's ex agent cortez .
you know , that one's defective .
something's wrong with the shape .
see if we can take that one back .
oh , man .
we're on .
we're on !
hello , juni .
donnagon .
been a good boy lately?
yes .
very , very good .
mrs. giggles must have straightened you out .
i certainly did .
hello , francesca .
yeah , she worked me over pretty good , actually .
aah .
darling , behave .
what do you know about a video game called game over?
i know that just about every kid in the world is gonna sign on and play it .
not if we can help it .
the game is a trap .
once plugged into the game , parents won't even be able to get their children's attention .
what else is new?
this is different .
once you get through the game , your mind belongs to the toymaker .
the inventor of the game .
he wants to enslave the world's youth with mind control .
you control the youth , you control the future of the world .
she's an ingenious hacker , your sister .
we sent her inside to shut down the game .
but ... she disappeared .
how can she disappear inside a game?
she didn't physically .
actually , she's right here in the building .
carmen !
carmen !
she can't hear you .
her mind's still in the game .
she got as far as level four , then nothing .
why would she even go in there without any backup?
because her first and only choice wouldn't answer our calls .
so she decided to go alone .
now , you go in .
find your sister .
help her shut down the game in 12 hours , or it's game over for everyone .
are you with us?
ok .
then let's go .
so i have to shut down the game but not release the toymaker?
exactly .
it would be catastrophic if he escaped .
the toymaker hates us for imprisoning him in cyberspace all these years .
what made you do that?
who knows?
it was years ago .
now , you'll have to start on level one like everyone else .
find your sister on level four .
then proceed to level five .
which is unwinnable .
level five is unwinnable?
level five is where you shut down the game .
if the game is not shut down , you'll stay trapped with everyone else when the toymaker takes over the world .
put on these glasses , and you'll enter the world of the game .
you're being sent into a zero gravity chamber alongside carmen .
that should give you a competitive edge .
when you're in the game , things will feel real .
are they real?
good luck , juni .
find carmen .
shut down the game .
and whatever you do , don't let the toymaker out .
ugh !
computer generated .
low res !
carmen .
carmen .
can you hear me?
it's juni .
your brother .
ugh !
pogo toads !
ugh !
ugh !
aah !
ugh !
ha !
ugh !
hey !
get your own ride , creepo !
sorry !
i thought you were a toad .
new player , huh?
yeah .
new player .
well , here's a lesson you won't soon forget .
aah !
how is he?
his brain waves are normal .
but how is he?
oh .
he fell .
stand up .
you fell three stories .
aah .
i survived?
not exactly .
that is your life count .
after taking heavy damage .
you lose a life .
what happens when i hit zero?
game over .
when you run out of life .
you lose .
no replays .
no restarts .
what happened to my 12 hours?
i only have four now .
time flies when you're playing games .
this is crazy .
better hurry .
ugh !
aah !
so who are you?
i'm juni cortez , ex secret agent of the oss .
i need to get to level five .
but i only have a few hours before the toymaker takes over the world .
level five?
level five is unwinnable .
i understand that .
but i have to save the world .
rez , this person thinks he's level five material .
so i hear .
you guys must be beta testers .
one of the first allowed to roam free these coveted digital hills , my friend .
how can i offer service?
i'm rez .
hi , rez .
now , about saving the world .
if anyone's gonna get to the great prize at level five , it's gonna be one of us .
whatever .
i want cheat codes .
back door entrances .
shortcuts .
anything .
i can pay you with bonus packs .
implementation of any form of hack code or cheat boost will trigger an immediate game over and permanent evac from the game .
it's in your tech manual .
you have to play the game by the rules or not at all .
all right .
how do i get to level two as quickly as possible?
lives are at stake .
please .
see that target?
hit it .
you'll bounce straight to the moon .
yeah .
i'd suggest a running start .
level two is on the dark side of the moon .
the way to get there is by hitting that target and bouncing to it .
not a lot of realism in these games , is there?
won't be seeing him anymore .
let's go .
less competition , the better .
aah !
aah !
ugh !
wow !
aah !
oh , great .
a message from the oss .
do you accept?
mm hm .
ok , juni , we can no longer be of assistance .
what assistance?
you do get one additional lifeline , which you can choose to use now or later .
now !
give it to me now .
you get to bring in any one person from the outside to help you on your journey .
call up the family files .
assertive .
athletic .
knows karate .
intelligent .
strategic .
knows karate .
wait a minute .
go back to grandpa .
pros .
superior intellect .
cons .
physically disabled .
he's been paralyzed from the waist down for 30 years .
his energy force would have doubled back again , making his arms , his heart , his brain twice as strong as a normal person .
what are you thinking .
sir?
i choose grandpa .
selected .
one moment .
that was fast .
sort of .
grandpa !
juni !
where am i?
in a video game run by a madman called the toymaker .
the toymaker is here?
you know him?
i've been hunting him down for 30 years , juni .
you shouldn't have brought me here .
i needed your help .
we have to find carmen and shut down the game .
what is that?
it's a power up of some kind .
mega legs .
give it to me .
grandpa?
you can walk .
no , juni .
oh , i can do more than that .
wow .
hmm .
grandpa?
hmm .
where are you going?
don't wait for me , juni .
i'll catch up with you .
but we have to find ...
carmen .
valentin , my old friend .
you think you'll catch me this time , don't you?
well ... you will .
oh , you will .
everything falls into place .
everything falls .
wow .
a courageous new contestant .
welcome to the robocon .
i need to get to level two .
well , you came to the wrong place .
this is the arena of misfortune .
to get to level two , you're gonna have to battle a mech .
how do i do that?
i'll explain it to you when you get up there .
hey , there .
just go out there in your battle mech and fight .
wait a minute .
who am i fighting?
her .
don't get too trashed and i win bonus points .
right foot , left foot .
right foot .
oh !
oh !
how do you work this thing?
ooh .
ooh .
ok .
i want a good .
clean robo fight .
there will be no kidney punches .
no rabbit punches .
no eye gouging or ear biting .
unless .
of course .
you can't help yourself .
hi .
i'm juni .
oh , i'm sorry .
i'm sorry .
he didn't mean it .
really , really .
no .
no , no , no !
please , no !
oh !
ugh !
hi .
i'm demetra .
aah !
help .
oh !
that's gotta hurt .
i'm the winner !
yeah !
whoo !
yes !
well , well , well .
for a kid that doesn't know how to fight , you sure know how to fight .
congratulations .
and keep the suit .
hey !
hey !
hey !
so , let's go over this again , shall we?
so there's no mistake .
so there's no gross error .
so there's no lack of communication amongst us .
what i want , what we want ...
what do we want?
our time on this planet is over .
it belongs now to our youth .
not if we control their minds !
we could start the world over again and cure it of its diseases .
we could begin anew .
forget what we could do !
it's what we should do !
am i doing the right thing?
it's not about the right thing .
it's about the smart thing .
ah .
we won't escape this place otherwise .
i speak for all of us when i say , " we want out !
hmm .
the end justifies the means .
you have the children's attention .
the question is , what are you teaching them?
who are you people?
we are you .
forgive me .
forgive me .
i forget the extent of my programming powers from time to time .
for a moment , i actually believed that you existed .
goodbye .
out , out , out .
out , out .
this childish game will soon be over .
and then the real game will begin .
hmm .
will you look at this?
hold on to your joysticks , boys .
i think we got him .
you're the guy .
i'm the who?
the guy .
the guy from the poster .
that guy .
no .
wait a minute .
i'm only looking for my sister .
she's somewhere on level four .
then i'm heading out through level five .
so you can win the game?
i guess that's one way of putting it .
you see , according to the tech manual , if we find the guy ... the guy ... he'll lead us through the unwinnable level .
just 'cause he made it out of robocon in one piece doesn't mean he's the guy .
he's the first i've seen to make it out with the power suit .
man , give me a break .
this wimp's a phony .
there's only one way to find out .
mega race .
the fastest , most dangerous race in the game world .
come on .
no .
wait .
i already told you i'm not the guy .
go .
ok .
the race will begin shortly .
claim your vehicle .
you got to be kidding .
this race will tell us if you're the guy .
if you are , you can hang with us .
but if you're a phony , arnold will crush you .
aah !
i'm not the guy .
how many times do i have to say it?
there are no rules in this race .
except win at any cost .
all right !
we'll try to help you out ... as much as we can .
the race will begin ... now .
one .
two .
three .
go !
hmm?
easy as pie .
juni , push the red button .
the one that says " do not push "?
yeah .
push it .
it's a turbo boost .
are you sure?
yeah .
aah !
hey , rez , give me a hand !
hey , how about a foot?
aah !
aah !
whoa !
whoa !
my turn , sucker .
aah !
you're supposed to be winning the race , juni .
grandpa !
what is this?
whoa !
ugh !
ugh !
nngh !
oh !
the glove !
grab the glove .
the glove !
ugh !
whoa !
whoa !
whoa !
ugh !
whoa .
uh oh .
aah !
grab another bike , juni !
final stretch !
five ... four ... three ... two ... one .
winner by a hubcap .
juni cortez !
i thought you were him .
i knew it .
i guess you are .
so , i hear you're the guy .
i am definitely the guy .
yeah !
yeah !
yeah !
so now what , guy?
i have to go talk to my grandfather .
to who?
i mean i must confer with the wizard of atari sega nendo .
yeah .
ok , cool .
congratulations .
you won the race .
but now they think i'm some important guy who's going to win for them .
for our purposes , that's very good .
they can lead us to level four more quickly , so you can find your sister , so we can shut down the game and make things right .
and so that i can find ... the toymaker .
we're not supposed to get near the toymaker .
so say the rules of the oss , which i'm not following .
he might escape .
we can't risk that .
oh , no , juni .
i don't plan on letting him go anywhere .
guy !
we'll talk about this later .
ok .
here it is .
i'm not supposed to lead you to level five .
you're supposed to lead me there .
so you mean we work together?
the wizard said if we all work together , we all win .
with my strength .
my brains .
my cool .
my intuition .
ok .
so you're the guy .
we're all counting on you .
but if you fail us or if you're not who you say you are , this life counter will hit zero faster than you can say " oops .
deal .
first i got to find my sister .
so level four , people .
move !
come on , grandpa .
he's doing good , huh?
huh?
yeah , he's doing great , and that's the problem .
why?
they've awoken the programmerz .
what?
pull him out of there now .
too late .
all right .
this is cool .
we'll get there in no time .
what is this?
wait a minute .
the programmerz .
who are these programmerz?
the brainiacs who wrote the book for the game .
so , they work for the toymaker , huh?
programmerz are the reason you found us on level one .
they caught francis cheating during the mega race .
they'll bounce us back to level one again if they catch us .
level one?
i don't have time for that .
spread out .
don't split up !
it never works !
if we just stick together ...
all right , grandpa .
i guess it's just you and me .
hello?
grandpa?
psst !
aah !
can you at least try and act like you're the guy?
you know my secret?
i've seen the real guy , and you're not him .
why are programmerz chasing us?
someone's got a game cheat .
what's this?
a map to the game .
this is illegal .
you want to find your sister or not?
give me the map .
ok .
wow .
we're in machine city .
if we cut across here , we'll be able to reach level four .
where carmen is .
right .
then , if we cut through lava mountain , we'll be right at the door of the unwinnable level .
shortcuts .
this is good .
this is very good .
game cheats .
that's against the rules .
we're gonna have to bounce you back to level one .
aah !
you can't scare us .
he's the guy .
grandpa !
listen to that , edog .
the guy is calling his grandpa .
i'm so scared .
come and get me , gramps .
what's he gonna do , drool on us?
why are you picking on my grandson?
why?
they got logos and edog , the leaders .
you are programmerz?
let's see what you really look like , huh?
very unimpressive .
computer nerds .
now tell me , where is the toymaker?
grandpa ... uh , wizard , put them down !
he's good .
the boy warrior is very , very good .
but he's got to keep going .
we run the risk of discouraging him if the next levels are too challenging .
but only by seeking challenges can we hope to find the best in ourselves .
can we help him?
no !
it's against the rules of the game !
this isn't a game .
it's life !
i don't mind talking to myself .
but when you guys start to cut me out of the conversation , that's when it gets a little strange .
that's it .
more life is what we need .
we'll grant the boy a gift .
the gift of life .
don't worry , guy .
from here on out , i'll protect you .
are you all right , guy?
hey .
he found a life pack .
a what?
that's rare .
i've never seen one up close before .
what do i do?
crush it in your hands .
you'll gain life .
how much?
all depends .
i got extra life , demetra .
congratulations .
you'll need it the most .
i want you to take it .
juni , i can't .
does he know what that's worth?
of course he does .
i owed you from the robot arena .
also , i don't want anything to happen to you .
thank you .
you have now entered level three .
i wish my family could see this amazing place .
what are you doing in the game , arnold?
well , actually , i got in on a beta tester's visa .
i'm here for the great prize behind level five .
it'll save my family from poverty .
but what waits for us in level five?
i mean , is it all true?
untold riches?
arnold , you should know that when we reach the end of the game
no .
don't tell me .
i want it to be a surprise .
i'm sure it will be .
attention .
gamers !
stand on the red line .
choose your best player .
the guy .
the guy's the best .
choose your strongest player .
that'd be arnold .
survival of the fittest .
face your opponent .
wait a minute .
i'm not fighting arnold .
i don't want to crush juni .
the winner shall proceed with the others to level four .
the loser shall be given an immediate game over and will be evacuated permanently from the game .
arnold , i have to save my sister .
i'm sorry , juni .
but i have my own family to think about .
i can't beat you , arnold .
i know .
fight !
aah !
not that i'm rooting for anyone in particular , but that was a really cool move .
aah !
nice knowing you , juni .
arnold , please !
unh !
( whirring slows .
stops )
what's going on?
you've been tagged .
what do you mean , i've been tagged?
someone has switched places with you .
not me , guy .
demetra , what are you doing?
you have to find your sister , juni .
don't !
don't do it !
demetra , no !
fight !
no !
aah !
demetra .
game over !
i never even got her e mail address .
don't fall in love with a game , juni .
let's get out of here .
sorry , juni .
my family .
you are causing so much pain .
and only i can stop you .
for i know why you do these things ...
toymaker .
bring it on .
find me , and the world will truly pay the price .
here in my cyberprison i was forced to create .
now i will destroy .
release the girl .
put her back in the game .
but , sir
oh , you have a better solution , don't you?
of course you do .
you all do .
so tell me .
what is the real answer?
i'm so curious .
revenge .
healing .
destruction !
love .
hate .
uh huh .
well , once again , you're all correct .
and once again , you're all incorrect .
on with the game .
you are now entering level four .
level four?
wait a minute .
carmen's on this level .
i'll use telepathy .
we might be close enough that it'll work .
carmen .
can you hear me?
what?
this game plays tricks .
tell me something only carmen would say .
my feet stink .
you sound close .
i am .
i see you brought grandpa into the game .
i thought it was a good idea at the time .
juni !
the toymaker's the guy who put grandpa in the wheelchair 30 years ago .
exactly .
if grandpa tries to take revenge , the toymaker will break free .
he's that powerful .
then we have to convince grandpa that revenge is not the way to solve it .
ok , guy .
we found your pal .
now , where are we going , exactly?
where's level five?
first of all , you don't ask the questions around here .
i do .
second of all
we're going to lava mountain .
we are?
beyond that is the passage to level five .
i don't think so .
oh , so suddenly you're the game expert .
we're following the guy .
you know , juni , we don't need these guys following us .
not where we're going .
i promised them they could tag along .
look , this is how i know where to go .
trust me .
lava mountain .
why is it that every video game has lava in it?
technically , that's not true .
there's no lava in halo .
and in metroid , it's molten magma .
can't touch the lava , or it's game over .
but i have six lives left .
doesn't matter .
you fall in , you lose .
the game's getting tougher , guys .
this is impossible .
what do you think , grandpa?
difficult .
let's go another way .
follow me , boys .
this doesn't make any sense .
i give them a map .
i give them the girl .
what more do they want?
can't i just lead them to the door?
lmpossible , sir .
the way the game's a. i. works is
i know .
i know .
can i just talk to myself at least?
you are talking to yourself .
i am you .
well , then , you , me , shut up .
so be it .
am i insane?
completely .
they're going the wrong way .
i have to drive them to level five .
send in the tinker toys .
finding another path .
now , this is good thinking .
she's good .
we should listen to her more often .
stay off my side .
ok .
what is this?
tinker toys !
wait !
what's worse , lava or tinker toys?
definitely tinker toys .
carmen , what do we do?
whoa !
ugh !
uh oh !
whoo hoo !
rip that wave , juni .
what are they doing?
they're straying from the path .
the toymaker must be pushing them towards his lair .
but why?
what could he gain from ...
check if there's a connection between the grandfather and the toymaker .
hurry , people !
it's coming on screen .
comrades turned enemies .
grandpa's gonna break the toymaker out of the game .
stop them .
stir the lava .
bigger waves .
lava monsters .
anything .
we have to create obstacles for them .
come on !
we have to drown them .
they'll get a game over and be evacuated from the game .
we can't risk letting the toymaker out .
do it .
this is new .
juni !
carmen !
francis !
arnold !
grandpa !
me .
aah !
where are they?
they fell in .
i know , but they should have gotten a game over .
they should be back here , actually .
hmm .
huh?
the lava .
it's cold .
this way .
juni .
this way .
we found a door to the next level .
come on .
i thought i was a goner .
i saw all my points flashing away before my eyes .
all i could hear was my father saying , " you blew it , arnold .
no untold riches for you .
uhh !
where's grandpa?
i don't know .
but he was here .
isn't this a piece of his armor?
carmen , it's a passage .
help me open it .
red flag , rez .
we have to talk about the guy .
highly sensitive .
what about him?
i've been rereading my tech manual .
it speaks of a deceiver within the game , who will mislead you down a path where no one will survive .
i think juni's the deceiver .
what do you suggest?
we'll have to get rid of him or risk losing the game .
what about his sister?
her too .
how much time do we have left?
five minutes .
what happens in five minutes?
this place gets flooded with players from around the world .
oh , great .
competition .
the toymaker will take over their minds .
that's why we have to shut down the game .
sh , carmen !
what is she talking about?
you didn't tell them yet , did you?
i was getting around to it .
deceivers .
what about the other side of level five?
there is no other side .
you'll be imprisoned in the game .
game over .
we're not letting you shut down this game .
you're gonna see how fast that counter can count backwards .
you have to go through me first , game boy .
now , listen to me .
i'm the guy .
stop saying you're the guy .
we all know that you're not the guy .
he's not the guy .
i am .
and you are?
i'm the guy .
the real guy .
and i say we go in , beat this unwinnable level , and get to the other side , where untold riches and a bounty fit for 10 kings awaits us .
i knew it .
now , he's definitely the guy .
but it's unwinnable .
nothing is unwinnable if we join together and battle as one .
we play on each other's strengths and help cover each other's weaknesses .
we can accomplish anything .
and we will accomplish everything .
but first let's go whip this unwinnable level and show it who's boss .
are you with me?
yeah !
stand aside .
cake .
aah !
aah !
oh !
oh , my .
oops .
guy !
ok .
you're the guy again .
get us through this , juni .
but i ...
demetra !
juni , quickly !
i found the switch to shut down the game .
i also found the exit portal .
we can all get out of here right now .
how did you survive?
there was a glitch in the game .
i don't know .
juni , who is this?
this is demetra , my girlf ...
my friend .
no , she's my
i'm his girlfriend .
who are you?
i'm his sister .
she gave me the map .
the map that got us here .
juni , she's not real .
what are you talking about?
i've been helping juni win the game .
what have you been doing?
playing prisoner .
that's what .
she set you up , juni .
she set us all up .
i ...
juni , she's lying .
she's been the toymaker's prisoner .
she could be brainwashed , for all we know .
do you want to win this game or not?
she's the reason this level's unwinnable .
she's the deceiver .
why?
i'm sorry , juni .
but it's in my programming .
congratulations !
you've made it to the end of the game !
you won !
untold riches for all of you !
and your prize is you get to stay ... here .
welcome to the game .
juni , this way .
this is the way out .
all of you , quickly !
wait !
we have to shut down the game .
i already did .
the switch is right there .
are you sure?
yes , yes .
go .
quickly , quickly .
run , grandpa !
go .
i'll hold it open .
go now !
demetra .
i can't hold it open forever , juni .
we made it .
here's our e mail addresses .
just in case .
terrific .
you're awesome , grandpa .
the way you took on those tinker toys .
you're the coolest .
thanks for everything , guy .
it was real .
sort of .
thanks a lot , guy .
what's wrong?
you don't want to leave , do you?
how can i go back , juni?
in here , i can walk .
i can run .
and you look at me like i'm some kind of superhero .
you are .
out there in the real world , to me .
you are .
all right , juni .
i shall go back if ... if you promise me that even though i'll be in a wheelchair , that you will look at me no differently than you are now .
because on the inside , juni , on the inside , i feel like this .
i promise , grandpa .
time to go .
coming through .
coming through , please .
those video games are killers on the eyes , huh , kid?
agent cortez , we'll take it from here .
my grandson will handle this .
don't touch .
this is corinthian leather .
ok .
so tell me again how you shut off the game .
i don't know if we shut it down , exactly .
we hit a switch , and it seemed to work .
oh , it worked .
the game's down .
we just need to make sure we did this correctly .
actually , grandpa hit the switch .
cortez , are these the boys that were in the game with you?
we tracked them through their e mail addresses .
yeah , that's them .
they wouldn't know anything about ...
hey , wait a second .
what happened to francis the brain ,
arnold the strong , and mr. cool?
well , in the real world , i'm not that smart .
i'm not strong .
i'm not cool .
reality check .
so who are you out here in the real world?
special agent cortez , we need you .
whoa .
i'm just juni cortez .
let's have it , grandpa .
what switch did you hit exactly?
there were two switches side by side .
one switch shuts down the game .
but the other releases the toymaker .
who was the idiot who designed that?
did you free the toymaker by accident?
oh , i freed the toymaker .
but it was no accident .
do you want to stop the game?
then you must defeat the toymaker .
it's the only way .
you crazy old man !
do you know what you've done?
grandpa , revenge doesn't solve anything .
will you trust me?
you of all people?
a message from the president .
oh , what does he want?
i'm coming back to settle the score .
for imprisoning me .
for using me .
devlin set us up?
it's not devlin .
all i wanted to do was right the wrongs .
start over a new world .
a new chance .
where everyone would get a second chance !
but no .
so now i'm taking this to the next level !
seismic activity off the map !
aah !
aah !
earthquake !
tornado !
hurricane !
carmen , let's go !
everybody , relax !
quick !
put your glasses on .
it's the only way you can see what's really happening .
the game has entered the real world .
there's only one thing to do in a situation like this .
what?
call in the family .
calling all cortezes .
this is it .
this is it .
this is it .
the moment we've been waiting for .
yes .
nobody move .
nobody move !
nobody touch the brain .
the fifth brain .
this is a historic moment .
probably the ...
probably the most important ...
no .
this is the most important moment of my life .
no one can disturb me now .
i must activate the brain .
now .
mr. cortez?
eh?
your children called .
some sort of emergency .
well , i'm their uncle .
dad , you need these to see .
glasses , quick !
incoming .
this won't be easy .
let's kick some metal .
what about all the other ones?
we need more help .
our family isn't big enough .
remember one thing .
everyone's your family .
calling ... everyone .
we're here to save the day .
floop and minion !
robot children !
take 'em down !
dinky winks !
somebody ring the dinkster?
whoa !
you're gonna make a nice addition to my theme park .
game over for you , pal .
game over !
somebody call in a loon?
sorry , romero , this is the only pair we had left .
they're a little broken .
they're perfect .
charge , sporky !
brand him , daddy .
thanks , little dink .
unh !
unh !
gary giggles?
yeah?
carmen cortez .
i need your help right away .
i'm there .
i'm here .
give me a hand .
whoa .
unh !
thanks .
hey .
hey .
thank you , gerti .
there's still one more .
that's impossible .
someone has to go up there .
and shut it down manually .
it's the only way .
but who?
i'm ready .
it must be done .
grandpa , no !
let him go .
your grandfather has to do this .
thank you for freeing me , valentin , but it's too late .
nothing can stop me .
not even you .
that's true .
only you can do that .
you double crossed us .
the agency , your fellow agents , and me .
your mistake cost me my legs .
well , a mistake like that could only push someone further into the dark .
and it has .
look at you now .
i gave you back your legs in the game .
i did that for you .
let me tell you all the things i've missed in my life because of the accident you caused .
i can't walk on the beach with my wife .
i missed my daughter's birth .
and wedding .
shall i continue?
grandpa .
don't .
now let me tell you all the good things that came of it .
humility .
spirituality .
understanding .
you've been living in fear of me all these years .
but i've only been searching for you so i could tell you that i forgive you .
i've only dreamed i would hear you say something like that .
now the question is , can you forgive yourself?
it's never too late , sebastian .
take your time .
take your time to decide .
we have about 10 seconds .
game ... over .
juni , get out of there !
grandpa !
so , wait a minute .
who won?
it's not whether you win or lose .
it's how you play the game .
to family .
to family .
to family .
to family .
to family .
to family .
to family .
to family .
to family .
to family .
to family .
to family .
to family .
family .
familia .

to family .
to family .
and break !
