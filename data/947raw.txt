i know i would be well advised to offer you a cocktail .

but if you take me for being impertinent i cannot let this calumny lie .
director of photography

if it seems that i impose upon you , accept me or not , as the case may be .
you can always send me to the place no one likes to go .
dr vlach and i meet in the coffee house every sunday .
last week i hired a man servant .
his name is saturnin .
my life is now filled with new experiences and surprises .
for me , life was something of a slippery slope .
i could maintain a cool head but not my balance nor my derriere .
youd be a good target , but no one here would be capable of such originality .
you mean harpooning whales?
i like your sense of humour .
coffee , coffee , soda water , soda water , ashtray !
humanity can be divided according to the caf man doughnuts theory .
the first man in the caf will just look at a plate of doughnuts .
the second considers throwing them at people .
the third gets up and starts throwing .
no !
such people dont exist .
where would you place saturnin?
such people dont exist .
where would you place saturnin?
excuse me , madam .
no !
weve moved , sir .
were living on a boat now .
thank you , saturnin .
on a boat by legions bridge?
i dont believe him .
you think that , if you had a flat this morning , you have one now?
your flat was like a primeval cave .
you liked it because you inherited it from your cave dwelling ancestors .
your flat has a ponderous air about it .
you exaggerate , doctor .
ive brought you some doughnuts for your trip , mr oulick .
mr saturnin said youre going to the north pole , hes cleaning your weapons .
dont distress yourself , iil send you a postcard of a polar bear .
a polar bear?
welcome , captain .
the boats ready , dinner is prepared .
let me take those .
doughnuts will be served with coffee .
your boat , your favourite easychair , your dinner .
bon appetit .
its the steamboat doing that .
does this happen often?
twice a day .
youil hear the horn .
better to flee to dry land .
would you like the lights on?
yes .
but if it means sinking the boat , id rather dine in the dark .
would you like a candle , gas lamp or electric light?
i havent seen any electric cables .
i suppose theyre submerged .
were not dependent on electricity , captain .
i think id prefer the gas lamp .
my friends think i hunt beasts of prey .
that i killed a shark with a camera tripod .
my boss asked me to sell him a crocodile tooth .
i dont hunt tigers or sharks !
stop telling my friends this nonsense !
that will be difficult .
they think you shot all these animals .
is anyone down there?
are you down there , mr oulick?
im looking for mr oulick .
how can i help you?
im coming down .
marcus aurelius has escaped !
we need you to help us catch him .
a man of unsound mind !
im not sure i understand .
dont be so modest .
just get your rifle .
youd better not be involved in this !
i swear to you that i am not .
you ought to help that man .
but hes deranged !
havent you got a weapon?
no .
mr oulick .
im the director of the zoo .
i admire your willingness and courage .
im sorry i didnt see you catch the lion with your bare hands .
thank you .
i thank you , too .
marcus aurelius is a lioness .
no ones perfect , sir .
few women have straight legs , eh?
they need you on court .
hello .
hello .
my partner hasnt arrived .
shall we have a game , we mustnt be idle !
id be very glad to .
you play without a racket?
no , sorry .
are you ready?
shall we take a break?
in the middle of the set?
we need to rest , have a drink ...
do you take rests when youre hunting?
in that case , its quite the opposite .
its a training wall , sir .
its a disgrace losing to miss terebov 3 : 0 .
where did you learn to play tennis , saturnin?
i used to coach a certain lady .
are you a champion swimmer as well?
the ball must travel to your opponents side as swiftly as possible .
and low over the net , thats this line on the wall .
weil have to make it higher .
im playing billiards , iil dine out .
and dont move us anywhere else .
you surprised me .
your new flat speaks of courage and a sporting spirit .
you know how many boats sink each year?
but not on the vltava .
but they do sink to the bottom .
the ships boiler might explode .
our boat hasnt got a boiler .
my uncle frantiek was an explosives expert .
but he passed away .
i remember his famous explosion .
i was afraid of soap after that .
uncle frantiek had a laboratory and a wife called kateina .
to make fine soap from fine raw materials is not an art !
to make soap from filth and grime is a task for a scientist .
screw on the compressed oxygen pipe !
you pour this in there , gentlemen .
turn the valve when i say !
will it turn out as soap , sir?
blast it if i know .
blast !
originally he had 20 employees , but only a few remained .
really , gentlemen !
you said thered be a blast !
im making soap , not dynamite .
i said blast !
i was just fulminating !
i wasnt being literal !
his staff then went to find safer work in an explosives factory .
what are we waiting for?
can i help you , madam?
put my luggage on the boat !
i am jis aunt .
i fear you are not expected .
welcome a guest and you welcome god .
my version of that proverb is somewhat different .
welcome on board , old chap !
dont old chap me when you cant even do up your pyjamas properly .
sun is the best medicine , ji .
its too dark in our flat , the spas too expensive and milou is ill .
theres fresh air and sun on a boat .
heil be right as rain here .
the more the merrier .
two heads are better than one .
too many cooks spoil the broth .
this is my man servant , saturnin .
weve already met .
no smoking on board .
who asked you?
your man servant is a bit strange .
this boat is too small for four people .
my husband supplied the whole family with floor wax !
but it stank and the wood turned black .
give a dog a bad name ...
nice boat .
iil mend the sail tomorrow .
this boat runs on a propeller .
it hasnt got a sail?
we have to buy a sail for the pole !
poles are for flags .
sails are tied to masts .
this boat doesnt have a mast .
thats true .
im tired .
lets go to bed .
good night .
milou !
dr vlach says that if we find the idyil , weil stop appreciating it .
fate would be doing us a good turn if it suddenly turned frosty .
fate threw me out of my cabin .
but theres no frost out here .
would you prefer your aunt and milou to leave?
theyre in their pyjamas .
i cant imagine their departure to occur without casualties .
its half past ten .
by midnight your boat will be empty .
is that you , milou?
what?
ive brought you some masks .
is there a carnival going on?
weve got rats here .
they might scamper across your face .
put these masks on .
youve got rats here?
im afraid we have .
milou !
i give it two minutes .
some are wise , some are otherwise .
you just needed to say the word .
why dont we launch the boat?
aye aye , captain !
it was a real problem finding advent masks in july .
what if she hadnt believed us?
id have gone to find some rats .
life is wonderful !
whats happening , saturnin?
i fear weve encountered a weir !
what weir?
by charles bridge .
is this boat insured?
of course .
wheres the next weir?
tvanice , but that ones bigger .
did he really say 50 years?
yes , but on 3 conditions .
that we sail to the north pole , that we name her after his fiance and that we name the first land we discover after him .
what is his fiance called?
theyre about to separate .
heil let us know when he finds another fiance .
i went on holiday to see my grampa , who used to run a power station .
he was a member of any club which had anything to do with electricity .
his house was 100 % electrified which fascinated me as a boy .
the director wishes you the best of health and sends you this brandy .
gentlemen dont drink alcohol before noon .
that is true .
but something terrible has happened !
dont trifle with me , saturnin .
is it really that bad?
yes .
theres no stopping a woman with a mission .
aunt kateina and milou have just arrived .
saturnin is behaving like a lout !
unlike some , saturnin was invited to this house .
you didnt greet aunt kateina?
my dear , how do you do .
no !
he said oh dear , how dyou do .
so he did , then .
this is dreadful !
im going for a walk .
iil help the director in his garage .
milou !
welcome .
grampa said hed be long dead before you got here .
heil only die if his greedy heirs finish him off .
grampa wants to accelerate his departure from this world .
saturnin is teaching grampa jujitsu .
it might work on aunt kateina .
shes here as well?
shes everywhere .
welcome .
im not doing so well .
but you look better .
hows the jujitsu going?
tumitsu , saturnin?
haisatsu is better , sir .
haisatsu !
are you all right?
ive got two broken legs , a few broken ribs and concussion .
i think ive sprained my ankle .
what kind of hold is this?
first aid , sir .
has miss terebov arrived?
who?
my friend engineer terebas daughter .
a nice young lady .
i forgot to pack your tennis racket .
plaster is unwelcome on holiday .
miss terebov has arrived .
lets have a look , then .
are you going to x ray my right foot?
yes .
but i injured the left one .
we need to take both legs so we can compare them .
ouch !
sorry , i didnt catch that .
dr zajek is very thorough .
he says its nothing .
perhaps hes right .
sorry to disturb .
were ready to go .
have you got a permit to leave?
no .
you have to get one from the office .
where is the office?
theres no one there now .
how do we obtain a permit , then?
you get one from the office .
from whom , if no ones there?
no one .
but they conveyed us here .
thats what ambulances are for .
you dont need one to leave .
is the driver a relative of yours?
no .
im trying to negotiate here .
you might hear someone in distress .
the vehicles just standing idle !
its only for patients .
youil be the patient soon !
in the surgical and psychiatric wards .
just write in the permit that the patient didnt survive the journey !
where have you been?
its going to rain !
its dangerous .
will we get through?
of course we will .
if this was a film , the bridge would be swept away by the water .
perhaps you really did kill that shark .
once a child , always a child !
i told him hed catch a chill !
like water off a ducks back !
right .
what are you talking about?
grampa took his raincoat and boots and went out into the storm .
he wants to see the competition making electricity .
its the last straw that breaks the camels back .
well , the bridge is broken .
cooks on the other side .
this place is suitable as a power station but not a house .
what have you got growing there?
better use a hankie .
im expecting an important letter !
the postman has to get through !
the electricitys not working .
someones got to see to the kitchen .
iil go and have a look .
sheil cook better than kateina .
iil find some alternative lighting .
alternative lighting?
im going to make some torches .
its raining and theres no electricity .
at least barboras here .
miss terebov permitted you to call her barbora?
dont be silly .
she hasnt gone unnoticed .
you take a fancy to twentysomethings?
youre too old for that .
i bet you that by the end of the week ...
help !
his whiskers are on fire !
get some water !
not water !
sand !
sand !
i have an unusual request .
i like unusual requests .
we agreed that saturnin would pursue milou relentlessly .
out of revenge for milou referring to miss terebov in that manner .
did grampa really ask milou to go out and look for worms?
he said that idleness could destroy a young man .
chess rules do not permit long and short castling .
i know !
iil put it back .
that young lady cant cook .
ive brought you some stewed fruit .
i dont want stewed fruit .
i want to play chess !
chess requires concentration .
impossible with aunt kateina around .
what about a glass of milk?
iil leave you , then .
ive got some worms .
so what?
i want to play chess !
check .
those are my figures .
no !
yes !
the table is laid .
who shut milou in his room?
silence speaks louder than words .
saturnin told me about his last place of employment .
you either stand too far away or you stand too near !
this rose is unseemly for a person of my age and it doesnt match my dress !
its disgraceful serving me meringue at my age !
no , no !
absolutely not !
the table is laid .
lunch was excellent , miss barbora .
you have our appreciation .
we need food , lets go mushrooming !
wonderful idea !
easy won , easy lost .
go elsewhere if you dont like it .
old people shouldnt eat mushrooms .
then dont eat them !
we wont find any mushrooms like this .
we must split into two groups .
weil draw for it .
give me some matches .
those who draw the same length will pair up .
the oldest draw first .
no head on mine !
we keep choosing but we still come back to the first variant .
no head on mine , either .
come on , ji .
just as well we found mushrooms .
auntie gave the food to milou .
dont you want jam on those?
did they leave us any?
i sense optimism .
thats a good thing .
how many days before one of us has to brave the water and cross the river to get food?
3 to 4 days .
no need to worry , ive arranged with the builder that if the old bridge is washed away heil build a new one .
allow me , young man .
you did that on purpose !
im not malicious .
sit on it properly , silly boy !
only my chair collapses and someones been moving my furniture about .
my birch water was replaced with paraffin !
someone put a wasp in my boots and it bit me !
wasps dont bite !
well , this one did !
people get cabin fever when theyre always together .
like us .
lets go on an outing to my log cabin , then .
we can spend the night in the cabin and then go into town .
whoever wants can stay here and weil bury him when we get back .
what if someone doesnt last out?
weil throw him to the wild animals .
dont know what group i belong in .
dont use your tennis as a gauge .
sorry , i thought you were a robber .
why are you fighting?
who broke that vase?
who gave milou a weapon?
whos ringing the doorbell?
i put a match there so wed know when the electricity was working .
i can hear someone talking .
its in spanish !
all the foods disappeared !
lets ask saturnin .
dont bring the servants into this .
perhaps he took the food .
no one suspects saturnin .
you make your bed , you lie in it .
just as long as we dont end up serving saturnin .
no use crying over spilt milk .
someone drank the milk .
ive got an important letter waiting for me and were arguing about food !
no one has started building a new bridge yet .
whats happened to the food we had for our journey?
this is getting ridiculous !
dont interfere , kateina !
madam kateina will tell you .
lets talk in private .
you can talk here .
no i cant !
call saturnin !
i told saturnin to take the food .
when theres danger , women and children have to go first !
so , you want to leave the weaker of us to the wild beasts .
milou and i were hungry .
we thought we wouldnt make the journey .
we ate everything !
i didnt know mother took the food .
im not a child !
our mistake .
we made light of a danger which poses no threat .
will you take my knapsack?
yes .
theres a deer over there .
where?
between the beech trees .
i cant see it .
you have to look from here .
its wonderful !
youre like a young man again !
a sound mind in a healthy body .
you mustnt believe those proverbs .
they took a man to hospital five times .
he thought a dogs bark is worse than his bite .
a friend of mine stayed here and he said hed leave the key here .
dear doctor , i like your sense of humour .
in prague you said climbing trees is extremely beneficial .
i didnt find the key but a note saying it was up in a tree .
i suspected the worst .
it wasnt 5 metres , but 7 metres up .
but it turned out well in the end .
i spent a lovely week here .
youil find the key in the pool .
happy diving !
how deep is it?
about 2 metres .
3 metres?
4 perhaps?
its not that deep .
come on , doctor .
jump !
jump?
well iil be !
that was a terrible dive !
some people love water .
is this the one , doctor?
im going to make a speech !
it was all uphill yesterday .
today its all downhill .
when we get to the town weil dine in style .
hooray !
aah !
hang on , grampa !
itil be all right .
pull it gently .
upwards?
no , to the right !
gently move it to the left !
why dont you all gently get lost?
i told you : dont count your chickens before youre out of the woods !
weil have to spend the night here .
dont be ridiculous !
theres nothing else for it .
madam , your blanket .
you take two blankets .
youre injured .
where did you get the blankets?
i brought them with me .
are you going to do your speech now?
yes .
good night !
weve got a hard day tomorrow .
good night .
you ought to have a shave .
whats the matter?
i saw you .
lets hasten in search of the sokol banner .
may our land be troubled until the battle ceases .
each stand in their place so long as the battle wages .
he who renounces his land , the blade will find his traitorous chest !
are you going to have a wash?
no , and im not shaving , either .
great idea , saturnin .
ive got a bottle like that in the cabin .
i know , this is it , doctor .
hunger is the best sauce .
prepare for the worst .
i think my hunger has passed .
thank the builder for me .
and buy me some aluminium acetate .
im going home .
young men may die but old men must die .
my husband was your son .
heil ask you up there if his wife and son are taken care of .
youre almost 70 .
how long do you think youil live?
barbora and i went to make purchases in town .
the shop assistant thought we were married .
i liked that .
and miss barbora didnt seem to mind , either .
why was bellerophon never able to catch pegasus?
someone has to come with me !
where?
up there .
the single rooms are all occupied !
put your dressing gown on !
people who jump off trams will be immediately caught by the police !
the directors writing his will .
grampa is a wise man !
hes not in a fit state to decide about his estate .
i hope youre not implying that grampa is of unsound mind .
the director has made his decision .
his relatives will be satisfied .
everyone will be taken care of .
not everyone !
does he realise this?
the director has left his entire estate to charity .
dont jump !
its not high enough !
milou !
were leaving !
im going to have that will invalidated .
i hope youre not implying that grampa is of unsound mind .
madam !
shes gone mad .
there we have it !
shes gone mad .
there we have it !
i never asked you for anything in 30 years .
but i have a request now .
id like saturnin to stay with me .
weve got a plan .
books state that young men stick out their chin , prepared for battle .
human anatomy rules out this posture .
weve found 120 examples of this nonsense .
and weve only gone through one volume in the library .
dont look at the driver while the car is moving !
talking is not allowed but looking is .
in this car its the other way round .
may i invite you somewhere?
yes .
when?
anytime .
wednesday at three at the national?
do i need to wear a life jacket?
last time , i wrote to you about the public plot probability office .
anyone can write to us who thinks the author takes him for a fool .
he sends us the text and we tell him the truth of the matter .
a blue cloud of cigar smoke rose above the desk of dubsk the industrialist .
he received slma the clerk coldly .
but slma was incensed .
he discovered his boss intended to marry off his daughter to a banker .
you villain !
what did you say?
youre a villain and an egotist !
your daughter loves me !
youre forcing her into marriage because of money !
i wont let that happen !
slma banged his fist on the table .
dubsk the industrialist went pale .
the industrialist was not dubsk but mikulka .
hed had a hard day .
a blue cloud of cigarette smoke rose above his desk .
he received slma in a normal fashion .
the clerk couldnt speak for anger .
illvain !
what did you say?
illvain !
sogetit !
dour laughter moves ye !
the industrialist was afraid for his employees sanity .
the industrialist had 2 daughters .
one married a banker she loved .
the younger one doesnt want to marry .
our office hereby states that only the cloud of smoke is true .
guess who?
good afternoon , barbora .
what would you like?
coffee and something sweet .
waiter , the lady would like a coffee and some doughnuts .
doughnuts?
yes .
every story should end with a wedding .
so i wont disappoint you .
a wedding was held in st anthonys for aunt kateina .
you have decided before almighty god to accept the holy state of matrimony .
i know i was well advised to offer you this story .
but if you take me for being impertinent i cannot let this calumny lie .
if it seems that i impose upon you , accept me or not , as the case may be .
you can always send me to the place no one likes to go .
dont look upon my grey hair , i dont even know if i have any .
so long as the spotlights and stage exist , i could sorely part with them .
