daddy , why does the snow flake?
because snow because snow flakes .
daddy , what is mustard made of?
because it's yellow ketchup .
daddy , why are men bald?
sometimes they're bald because their head is shiny ... and they don't have hair on it .

sturdy is boring , sam .
these shoes light up , ok?
these are really good shoes for school .

they look like the shoes that dorothy wore ... played by judy garland in " the wizard of oz " ... 1939 , directed by victor fleming .
these are pink .
these are also velcro .
they might have a little arch in there , too .
sam , these are probably too big ... but i thought maybe lucy would like those .
when we were at the zoo , she liked the animal prints .
but these are for adults .

i don't know who you are .
i like these , daddy .
she knows what she likes .
that's why she likes these .

oh , boy , i'm really in trouble .
are you in trouble , too?
are you in trouble , too?
yeah , i'm in trouble , too .
it gives us great insight into what she must be feeling .
mr. dawson , it's becoming clear ... that she's holding herself back in the classroom .
it's as if she's literally afraid to learn .
no one doubts that you love your daughter .
but the department of child and family services ... contacted us .
they shared with us that your records show ... that your intellectual capacity ... is around that of a 7 year old .
our concern is what happens when lucy turns 8 .
mr. dawson , do you understand ... what ms. wright is trying to tell you about lucy?
john wanted to try new things .
and it wasn't yoko's fault .
no , it wasn't yoko's fault .

i'm stupid .
you are not stupid .
yes , i am .
you are not stupid , because you can read that word .
i don't want to read it if you can't .
no , because it makes me happy .
it makes me happy hearing you read .
yeah .
it makes me happy when you're reading .
they perched in silence for a long time .
'how can we be so different ... and feel so much alike? 'mused flitter .
'how can we feel so different ... and be so much alike? 'wondered pip .
'i think this is quite a mystery . " '
keep going .
they have oreo ice cream mud pie .
this is so great .
yeah , this is so great .
and the menu says ... you can have your favorite breakfast all day .

i'd like the super big boy with a root beer float , please .
ok .
what about you?
i would like to have two eggs , sunnyside up .
but not runny , ok?
not runny .
and then i would like to have french pancakes ... with the fruit topping on the side .
we don't have french pancakes .
we have french toast .
no , i don't want french toast .
i want french pancakes , like at ihop .
just the same kind like they have at ihop .
that's what my favorite breakfast is , ok?
they're those thin pancakes .
the crepe pancakes?
i don't even want crepes .
i want to have french pancakes ... with the fruit topping on the side .
that's what i want to have , please .
thank you .
we don't have that , though , sir .
do you want regular pancakes and jam
i don't want something else !
why did you ask me that?
i'll see .
maybe they have something
yeah , ask bob !
ok .
ask bob's big boy .
because the customer's always right .
i understand that
the customer's always right .
because when lucy comes through the door ... everybody says , " surprise !
you gotta stop bouncing for a second .
you'll say , " surprise !
can we keep bouncing?
you'll have to come down .
after lucy gets here and we say , " surprise .
so you have to assume surprise position .
should we rehearse it one more time?
assume the surprise position .
annie was supposed to warn us .
brad , hit the light .
surprise !
it's not her .
hi .
i don't know if you remember me .
i'm margaret calgrove ...
department of child and family services .
we met at the police station .
put the present there .
you have to hurry , because lucy's coming .
come on , hide with us .
come on , over here .
annie said lucy's coming up the stairs right now .
so you have to assume the surprise position .
i bet she already knows .
why are you being a party pooper?
she's coming now .
you have to assume the surprise position .
don't touch me .
i've got cooties !
it's contagious !
hey , what are you doing?
get your hands off him .
what are you doing touching my kid?
surprise !
leave him alone !
happy birthday .
daddy?
you don't have to call him daddy .
she said you're not her real father anyway .
she said she was adopted .
lucy !
given the fact that the father ... was arrested for solicitation ... couldn't control his emotions ... endangering other children .
no , you can't !
it's her birthday !
ms. calgrove also cites ...
mr. dawson's mental delays which raise serious questions ... about his ability to properly parent .
run !
i find at this time ... it's not in the best interest of the child to remain in the home .
and i order her detained ... until a formal jurisdictional hearing .
mr. dawson .
is there anything you'd like to add?
i wanted to make it a really special surprise party .
so i went , and i got plates at the pic 'n 'save ... in yellow and in pink like a princess .
and then i went to the toy store ... and i got balloons with the helium in them .
mr. dawson?
yeah .
it sounds like you gave her such a lovely party .
yes , i'm sure it was .
right now , i want to talk to you about your legal rights .
ok .
there's room at this table ... if anybody wants to sit next to me .
i just want to talk to you about your legal rights ... so if you have not already retained legal counsel ... the court will appoint someone for you ... to present your case on january 5 .
ok?
that's a month from now ... so i come back here in one month with lucy .
no , mr. dawson .
you will have monitored visits ... two times a week for two hours .
and now we're moving on to 4 d , parker
what do you mean?
you will see lucy two times a week for two hours .
why isn't lucy going home with me?
i want her to go home with me .
not today .
thank you , mr. dawson .
4 d. parker vs. van wert .
thank you .
of course the judge picked the lawyer .
for god's sake , put it together .
she's the one who took lucy away from you ... so it's time that you get your own lawyer now .
you guys think i'm guilty?
no , sam .
you didn't kill anybody .
i miss lucy , sam .
me , too .
you need a personal injury lawyer ... because you have been personally injured .
when dustin hoffman was trying to keep billy ... from going back to meryl streep ... his lawyer told him that it would cost him $15, 000 ... and that's if we win . $15, 000 !
and that's if we win .

i wonder if you noticed that , because i noticed that .
go !
no more shrinks .
i'm sorry , mrs. dawson ... but if i were you , i wouldn't waste any more of my time .
sorry , mrs. dawson , but i think you should put sam in a home .
sam in a home .
mr. dawson , you do understand ... that since i'm a court appointed psychologist ... the traditional client therapist confidentiality ... will be waived .
do you understand that?
that the confidentiality will be waived .
good .
let's begin .
i went to a doctor one time who had an orange office .
all the walls were painted orange .
do you know her?
she has an orange office ... and she's in van nuys .
i wanted to ask you about lucy .
how old is she now?
she's six .
she's seven .
she just had a birthday , i think .

before you read your message ...
press the red button for record .
let's start with the o. g. m.
what?
i don't know .
i don't think it's working .
i think it's because it's a used machine .
it's not used .
it's pre owned .
a guy bought it for his auto shop ... and then he got a secretary .
testing , 1 , 2 , 3 .
that's a good code .
i can remember that 1 , 2 , 3 .
4 , 5 , 6 .
7 , 8 , 9 .
9 , 10 , 1 1 , 12 .
quick .
you're recording .
hi .
this is
hi .
this is sam .
i'm not home .
no , you really don't want to say that ... because you don't want to tell them you're not home .
then i'm lying .
everybody's lying .
sam , you are on the air .
hi .
how are you?
maybe you sound a little bit too excited .
and maybe you might think about lowering your voice ... so maybe lucy can hear you .
go , sam .
hi , lucy .
thank you for calling me .
that was good .
but did i sound like a good father?
but it's an outgoing message ... so i think you need to sound a little more outgoing .
hi .
this is sam .
i'm not ho shoot .
hi .
this is sam !
i think you should sound like a normal person .
from the heart .
from the heart .
this is hello .
thank you for calling .
this is sam .
wow .
i feel that was a very touching moment right there .
i felt that one .
high five .
we have a lot to go over , and i have five minutes .
rothman , glenn , harrison , williams ... is on the 29th floor .
that's 29 floors up ... and the elevators are actually over there .
keep up .
got to do my cardio .
120 .
got to get to 125 to make it count .
i need that list of names from you ... people who can testify that you're a good father ... despite your handicap .
just my husband .
i didn't mean your handicap .
i meant your disability .
the fact that you're retarded that's not the right word .
i don't know what to call you .
sam .
you can call me sam .
all right !
hello .
hi , todd .
i was out of range .
how you doing?
what do you mean , what's that supposed to mean?
you're supposed to be taking him to karate .
are you eating?
no , i will not hold on .
go pick him up .
i can't hear you .
i'm in the car .
they put you through to me .
i'm losing you .
what makes sam a good father?
the important thing is for sam to be a very good father ... is to be there for her ... because the smarter lucy is , the smarter she will get .
so what makes sam a good father?
lucy's first word was " annie ... " and her fifth word was " joe .
and i'm joe .
sam is a very good father ... because he likes green things ...
like i like green things very much .
i like green peas .
my cousin luke works for the organization environmental organization greenpeace ... and they like to save the whales .
i like whales .
moby dick " was one of my all time favorite classics ... by herman melville .
wait .
why are you recording this?
it's often necessary
you didn't say anything about a tape recorder .
who's listening?
me .
what is that supposed to mean?
nothing .
who are you really?
i need to speak to my lawyer now .
i don't think you realize what you're up against .
we have to be in court in three days ... and we don't have a decent witness .
now , you've got to know someone who can testify ... who's been to college ... or has a degree of some kind ... or has some way of expressing themselves ... that will make the court believe you deserve ... to get your daughter back .
i need coffee .
big , tall .
tall is the smallest .
yeah , of course .
once you think of this person ... and there has to be one person , call me at work .
because i'm going back there now ... to my seven other cases .
what?
mrs. robeck .
i'm on the 405 .
the traffic is horrible .
you want this for here or to go?
dorothy?
oh , no .
no .
tow truck is towing your car .
son of a bitch .
it's towing your car .
no , wait !
stop !
it's my car .
stop .
but , annie , it's just one day .
and lucy needs you because you went to college ... and you can give the right answers .
and we can't lose her .
i'd make it worse for you .
i can't do it .
don't you think i would if i could?
all rise for the honorable judge phillip mcneilly .
hi , guys .
hi , sam .
boy , you did a wonderful job making those signs .
you're welcome , sam .
good luck , buddy .
go get 'em .
although , at her birthday party ...
i believe her true feelings about her father were revealed .
objection .
true feelings revealed "?
your honor , ms. davis is an expert ... appointed by the court for her opinion .
i'll allow it .
then every child who rages ... because they didn't get to stay up ... that extra hour to watch tv
any child who said they hated their parents ... because they didn't want a bath ... would be a prime candidate for foster care?
objection , your honor .
sustained .
i think they want you to stop .
really?
thank you , sam .
yeah , ok .
brad's wearing a tie today ... and i think the tie looks wonderful on you , brad .
you look great , too .
there's a lady she's writing everything down .
watch what you say .
i have the best friends in the whole world .
continue with your witness , mr. turner .
ms. davis , i assume in your therapy session ... that mr. dawson extolled his parenting ability .
on the contrary .
mr. dawson admitted he felt very confused at times .
actually , that he felt terrified ... that he'd made and would continue to make and i can quote here
huge mistakes , huge mistakes ...
mistakes that are huge .
thank you .
no further questions .
you're a mother , aren't you , ms. davis?
yes , i am .
would it be fair to say that ... as a parent , you've been confused from time to time ... possibly overwhelmed on occasion ... even though you're a wonderful mother?
if ms. davis has never had a moment ... where she's been confused as a mother ... it would bias her expert opinion .
i know that i have many moments as a parent ... where i felt i've made huge mistakes .
objection .
get to the relevant point , ms. harrison .
the point is , you've never had those moments ... have you , ms. davis?
moments that every parent i've ever spoken to has .
moments where the task is so unbelievably challenging ... that you feel retarded ... disabled in some way .
moments where everyone seems to have the key but you .
really , to be honest
yes or no?
please answer the question .
i didn't really feel right now
let me rephrase the question .
when your son o. d. 'd  objection .
if ms. davis didn't feel she had made mistakes ... mistakes that were huge ... it might bias her opinion toward mr. dawson .
i'll allow it .
ms. davis , when your son o. d. 'd ... did you feel that you might have made mistakes ... mistakes that were huge?
yes .
yes .
no further questions .
you made her cry .
i got lucky .
oh , no .
that's not nice to make her cry .
only in there .
and your secretary when you hated your desk .
green and yellow on the same plate .
could you separate the lima beans ... from the corn , please?
sam , don't be impossible .
can i have the spinach omelette only egg whites , no fat , no oil , no butter .
and extra mushrooms?
absolutely .
my treat .
no , no , no  my treat .
my pro bono .
that means she doesn't have to pay .
i pay .
sam , do you really want to get this ... or are you just trying to ... trying to act like a ...
what do you mean?
you know , like never mind .
i'm a grownup .
i didn't say that .
you think what they think .
you're my lawyer , and you think what they think?
i don't have a chance .
i think ... you deserve a fair trial .
do you think what they think?
sam can't order food or sam can't pay a check .
sam can't take care of lucy?
it doesn't matter what i think .
it matters that we win .
it matters what you think .
it doesn't matter to them what i think .
it matters to me !
it matters to me !
