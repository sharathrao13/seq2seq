you're not listening to me .
but we gotta do it .
use these bamboos here .
come on , come over here !
all right , take these bamboos and select only the big ones ... and put them together in bundles .
then make the basic frames with them .
the frames .
no , you're not listening .
and we put this mast ...
you have to have a couple of sweeps down the side , and a tail .
otherwise ... around the one third of the raft's length from the aft .
that is the basic plan .
you gotta have something strong enough to get through the reef !
i'm telling you .
if you keep talking like an amateur , we'll never make it !
i can't talk any sense to that guy .
this is our island .
in our north east north ... there must be a big island .
north east north .
if we go north east north riding a good tide ... we should find a big island .
let's get out of here as soon as we can .
let's do it .
what do you want me to do?
if we stay here , both of us will be dead for sure .
how many times do i have to tell you?
you might as well dry up on this island and drop dead !
not me .
i'm not going to die .
no , not me !
now wait , don't get mad .
okay .
all right .
all right , we build a raft .

when you hit the water like that , you flip and it's over .
it worked out okay .
so , boom , down i go .
the canopy's open , of course , and so then i bail out ... and that's when i pull the life raft and ....

how about you sing a song or something?
it didn't make any difference , anyway .
my crew was already dead .
what's the matter?
sing .
okay , i will do it , then .
when i go on sea
i will become a corpse in water
when i go on hills
i will become a corpse with moss
if my spirit can be near the emperor i would not be regretful about myself
i'm sorry .
sorry , i didn't mean to ....
all right , don't worry .
we have plenty of sake .
here , have some more .
thank you .
