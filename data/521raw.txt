the commander and jetstream .
his super strength makes him pretty much indestructible .
she has the power of supersonic flight along with a total mastery of unarmed combat .
by day , they live as steve and josie stronghold , the top real estate agents in the metropolis of maxville .
but whenever duty calls , they are the commander and jetstream .
mom and dad .
that's me in the middle .
you look at them and see the defenders of the world .
all i see is my dad wearing tights .
don't get me wrong .
it can be cool to have superhero parents ,
like when mom picks up awesome takeout on her way home from work .
on the other hand , living up to the family name means that i'm supposed to save the world someday .
here we go .
i just have one small problem .
everybody wants to rule the world ]
come on .
come on .
exactly what we want to hear .
well , that was bert timmerman and he is buying the colonial on pine terrace .
above asking .
no contingencies .
honey , i know that selling real estate is just our cover , but i think we're in line to win that sales trip to hawaii .
we haven't been to hawaii since king kamehamayhem set off that volcano .
you , me on the beach , no exploding volcanoes .
mmm , i can feel the sand in my toes already .
will is gonna be down any minute .
hey , it's his first day of school .
where is he?
will?
will?
oh !
ah !
come on , buddy .
let's get moving !
two hundred !
oh , hey , dad .
just trying to get a few sets in before school .
low weights , high rep , huh?
good thinking .
don't want to bulk up .
nah , going more for definition .
big day , huh?
will?
i just want you to know how proud i am that you'll be attending my alma mater and someday following me into the family business .
real estate?
right .
real estate .
on a more serious note , son ,
i know that every kid thinks his dad's invincible and i nearly am , but who knows?
maybe the next time i punch a meteor hurtling toward earth ,
i'll be the one who shatters into a million pieces .
i i guess all i'm trying to say here , will , is it's nice to know that whatever happens to me , you'll still be around to save the world .
looking forward to it .
we all are .
oh !
hey !
oof !
good morning , mrs. stronghold .
mornir .
i noticed you had recyclables in the trash .
i took the liberty of moving them for you .
thank you , layla .
you hungry?
i've got plenty of eggs , bacon .
no , thanks .
you know how my mom can communicate with animals?
apparently , they don't like being eaten .
how about some juice?
great .

oh , hi , layla .
good morning , commander .
commander , huh?
oh .

he wouldn't let go of my leg .
mom !
oh .
josie .
oh , will , uh , a reminder .
a lot of the kids at sky high will only have one superhero parent , not two , so take it easy on them , huh?
no showing off .

not to worry .
i'll keep it low key .
mrs. rivera?
josie stronghold .
i'm gonna need to reschedule that open house .
great .
steve !
gotta go !
let's check with a picture from news chopper five .
evil has struck our morning commute .
here's a hint .
if you're traveling eastbound on the 115 , you might think about alternate routes .
hang on .
this just in .
the commander and jetstream are on their way .
are you sure he'll be ok?
what if he forgets his lunch?
josie , josie , you've got to stop babying the boy .
you're right , you're right .
left .
left !
circle back around !
i'm on it .
release !
launch !
oh !
and the robot goes down !
he's plucking out a souvenir from another successful battle .
what a team !
the commander and jetstream .
how does it feel to save the world again?
what would we do without them?
they are good .
now , i know it's just our first day , but i already can't wait to graduate and start saving mankind .
and womankind .
and animalkind .
and the rain forest .
of course .
hello , kids .
hi , mrs. kibbitch .
i just feel really good about this year .
yeah .
it should be great .

son of the commander and jetstream !
i'm ron wilson , sky high bus driver .
if i can make your journey more comfortable , let me know .
you two !

the seat behind ron wilson belongs to will stronghold .
it would be an honor .
it's fine .
you don't have to .
no , i want to .
you're third generation , man .
magenta , get up .
why?
he only needs one seat .
so he can sit with his girlfriend .
layla?
no , she's just my friend .
yeah , totally .
he's like my brother .
oh , well , in that case , hi .
i'm larry .
yo , will .

i powered up before i started shaving .
and here's me , dude , halfway through august , and zip .
oh , so you ...

yee hoo !
pfff !
freshmen .
there she is .
sky high .
kept aloft by the latest in antigravitational propulsion .
she is in constant motion as a precaution against those who otherwise might have nefarious plans , her location supplied only to a few highly qualified individuals such as myself , ron wilson , bus driver .
smooth and easy .
whoa !
sorry !
word of advice .
don't miss the bus , 'cause the bus waits for no one .
except for you , will stronghold !
you ever running late , running early , or you just want to talk ... ... give me a call .
thanks , ron .
seriously .
can't stop the world ]
yeah !
freeze girl !
hello , freshmen , don't be shy
welcome newbies to sky high !
juniors , seniors , all the rest
we're back to school sky is the best !
ready , one , two , three .
whoo !
we're number one !
sky high !
we're ...
i hate that cheer .
speed , round 'em up , ok?
hey , freshmen !
your attention , please .
i'm lash .
uh , this is speed .
as representatives of the sky high welcoming committee ...
we'd be happy to collect that $15 new student fee .
um , there was nothing about a new student fee in the handbook .
ok , guys .
very funny .
i'll take over from here .
hey , everybody .
i'm gwen grayson , your student body president .
i know you're all going to love it here at sky high .
i know i have .
i've just had the greatest experience ...
true ]
... but there are a few rules that i just want to let you guys know .
first of all ...
if you can remember those few simple rules ,
i promise you will not fall off the edge of the school .
follow me inside for orientation .
rules?
what rules?
werert you paying attention?
good morning .
i am principal powers .
on behalf of all the faculty and staff , welcome to sky high .
yeah !
in a few moments you will go through power placement and your own heroic journey will begin .
" power placement "?
sounds fascist .
it's how they decide where you go .
the hero track or the loser track .
th th there's a loser track?
i believe the preferred term is " hero support .
for now , good deeds and good luck .
let the adventure begin .
comets away !
all right , listen up .
my name is coach boomer .
you may know me as " sonic boom .
you may not .
here's how power placement is gonna work .
you will step up here and show me your power .
and , yes , you will do so in front of the entire class .
i will then determine where you will be assigned .
hero or sidekick .
now , every year there are a few students or , as i like to call them , " whiner babies , " who see fit to question and to complain about their placement .
so let's get one thing straight .
my word is law .
my judgment is final , so there will be no whiner babies .
are we clear?
i said , are we ... [ roaring ] clear? !
yes , coach boomer !
go time !
you !
what's your name?
l l larry .
little larry .
get up here .
what's humiliating him going to prove?
this is so unfair .
if life were to suddenly get fair ,
i doubt it would happen in high school .
car !
big larry .
hero !
so he's good .
but i'm better .
did i say you were next?
name's zach , coach boomer .
try not to drop your clipboard .
any day now , superstar .
i'm doir it .
doir what?
i'm glowir .
i don't think so .
well , it's easier to see in a dark room .
turn off these lights , cup your hands around your eyes and look real close ...
sidekick !
are you sure you don't want to just ... [ roaring ]
sidekick !
you !
front and center !
let me start off by saying
what an honor it is to ...
is that your power?
butt kissery?
very funny , sir .
i've heard you had a wicked sense of ...
shut up and power up .
right away , sir .
say , that's pretty impressive ... ... for a popsicle !
sidekick !
hero !
side ... kick !
super spit?
sidekick .
acid spit .
hero !
ho !
hero !
and a handsome one at that .
get out of here , knucklehead !
purple kid .
let's go .
what's your shtick?
i'm a shape shifter .
ok .
shift it .
a guinea pig?
yep .
not even a swarm of guinea pigs?
uh , no .
sidekick .
shoo !
bite me .
you .
flower child .
let's go .
uh , i believe in only using my powers when the situation demands it .
well , you're in luck .
this is the situation , and i'm demanding it .
but to participate in this test would be to support a flawed system .
the whole hero sidekick dichotomy only serves to ...
let me get this straight .
are you refusing to show your powers?
it's more complicated .
sidekick !
we'll pick it up right after lunch , starting with you .
that's not cool .
i tell you , boomer will regret making me a sidekick .
i tell you , boomer will regret making me a sidekick .
all right?
someday it'll be dark , he'll be all alone , walking to his car .
he'll drop his keys , and i won't glow to help him find 'em .
you got a problem with me?
uh , no .
no what?
no , sir .
no , sir !
no , sir !
just messir with you , sidekick .
you're not supposed to use your powers outside of the school gym !
the cafeteria staff requests sidekicks stop ordering hero sandwiches .
am i crazy , or is that guy really looking at me?
dude .
what?
that's warren peace .
that's warren peace?
yeah .
i've heard about him .
his mom's a hero and his dad's a supervillain .
baron battle .
where do i come in?
your dad busted his dad .
quadruple life sentence .
no parole until after his third life .
that's great .
my first day of sky high , and i already have an archenemy .
hmm .
is he still lookir?
no .
no?
no .
i thought you said he wasrt looking .
there is no smoking on school grounds , or freezing or bursting into flame .
i'm ...
will stronghold .
aha !
mind reader !
no .
name tag .
right .
uh ...
uh , these are my friends .
that's zach .
what's up?
and ...
layla .
got it .
i'm gwen .
hi .
i love your skirt .
th thanks .
how's power placement going?
um ... great .
i'm not surprised .
i need a freshman rep for the homecoming committee ...
true ]
... we could talk about it over lunch .
i eat lunch .
how cute is he?
i guess i'll see you guys around .
yeah .
bye .
bye .
i don't think she really liked my skirt .
see you .
and thanks for the swirly .
what's up , guys?
the kid , uh ,
looked a little dehydrated .
how about it , stronghold?
you gonna hang with us this year?
help us bring some pain to the sidekicks?
that sounds like ... fun .
hmm .
good man .
see you around .
ok .
what do you mean , you don't know what your power is?
well , uh ...
i got it .
you're messir with the coach .
just like your old man !
car !
wow !
that was close !
are you insane? !
i don't have super strength !
oh , i get it .
you're a flier , just like your ma .
why didn't you say so?
whoa !
quit messir around .
i haven't got all day .
what's your power?
i don't have one .
stronghold .
siiiide ... ... kick !
hmm .
i remember doing this to your father when he was just your age .
kicked me through that wall !
you , uh , haven't called him yet , have you?
like i want to be the one to tell the commander his son has no powers?
ooh !
let's ...
let's take a look at that chest .
well , nothing seems to be broken .
except for me not having my powers .
well , maybe you're just a late bloomer .
you could get one of them or both .
your mother's flying or your father's super strength .
but when?
the kids who get bit by , uh , radioactive insects or fall into a vat of toxic waste , their powers usually show up the next day .
or ... they die .
ooh , lookit .
but kids who inerit their powers ... ... well , impossible to say .
but i will get them , right?
many sidekicks are the offspring of one super parent , mmm , and one ordinary parent .
hmm !
but there are cases , rare , yet not uneard of , where the child of two super powered parents , mmm mmm , never acquires any ... powers whatsoever .
there are?
like who?
well , i know of only one .
ron wilson , bus driver?
there he is .
there he is now .
a three and a half bath victorian with original crown molding?
you bet we'd love to take a look .
how's , uh ...
when do we brief the president on supervillain infiltration of the irs?
president would be monday .
tuesday?
great .
no , thank you , linda .
hon , dinner's almost ready .
could you stop playing with your robot eye
and help set the table?
sure .
oh , there he is !
hey .
man of the hour !
well , how'd it go?
um , dad , we need to talk .
you mean a little hero to hero talk?
i think i know just the place .
come on .
hon?
ok , so , dad ...
oh , this isn't the place , will .
this ...
... is the place .
no way !
the secret sanctum?
you know , i'll never forget my first day at sky high .
your grandfather finally trusted me enough to give me the key to his secret sanctum .
'course , in those days , we still used keys .
go ahead , son .
i already added your biometrics this morning .
oh , will , one thing .
'course , you must never ever bring anyone into the secret sanctum .
that's why it's called the secret ... sanctum .
uh , i would never .
go for it .
oh , this one's mine , will .
you can use mom's .
sorry .
no way .
you've got a pool table?
how about the pinball machine?
man .
let's see .
where do i start?
uh , i don't know .
over here we got mom's stuff .
uh , scientific equipment , gadgetry , whatnot .
will?
oh .
yeah .
all our greatest battles .
our finest moments .
ticranium's head .
exo's number one bug bot .
and is this , uh ...?
royal pairs pacifier .
now that was a great day , will .
the first time your mom and i ever teamed up to fight evildoers .
soon as she came smashing through the window , i knew she was the one for me .
i wish you could have seen us .
we were fantastic !
royal pain got his , and i got the pacifier .
and this is my proudest possession .
oh .
well , it's amazing .
well .
what's it do?
no idea .
so this is it .
it's all down here .
our story , your mom and me , of , well , kickir butt and takir names , huh?
but now it's time for a new chapter in the story .
the three of us , fighting crime together side by side ... by side .
now , what was it you wanted to tell me about?
oh , um ... ... that i'm gonna kick your butt at pool !
well , we'll see about that !
ok .
choose your weapon , sir .
i'll break .
there it is .
you got the right one .
you were right .
he took it home .
hey , he's got the ego the size of a giant robot .
uncle !
uncle !
uncle !
please , please let me get what i want ]
hey , layla .
hi .
so where were you after school?
i was worried .
i got stuck in the nurse's office .
and the news just keeps getting better and better .
turns out i may never get my powers .
how'd your dad take it?
what was i supposed to do?
he showed me the secret sanctum .
you have to tell them .
my parents are the greatest superheroes on the planet .
everybody expects greatness from me .
well , you are great .
thanks .
ok , so you're a sidekick .
it's not the end of the world .
when life gives you lemons ...
make apple juice?
i can't make lemons .
i don't know what it is .
yeah , but see , no .
you have an awesome power .
you could have made hero easy .
i'm not into labels .
but why would you choose to be a sidekick?
because i think the whole thing is stupid .
dividing people into groups like that .
i mean ... ... what is this?
high school?
apple?
thanks .
morning , class .
welcome to hero support .
my name is ... ... all american boy !
'course , nowadays ...
ooh ! ... i just go by mr. boy .
but this year , it will be my privilege to help each of you become the very best hero support that you can be .
without hero support , why , there wouldn't be any heroes .
all right , there probably would be heroes , but they would be very lonely .
lonely heroes indeed .
and ...
yes?
uh , yeah , um , when do we pick our names and costumes?
because i call dibs on " zach attack .
well , you don't get to pick .
on graduation day , you'll be assigned to your hero , and then he or she will , uh , decide what you will be called and what you will wear .
i think this is mostly done in an attempt to avoid clashing colors .
that's why when i was paired with ... ... the commander , red , white and blue it was , which for me was a very good thing because , uh , as you can see , blue really just makes my eyes pop !
it's very dramatic .
huh .
uh , excuse me .
i didn't know you worked for the commander .
i worked with the commander .
we were a team ,
mr ...
mr ...
stronghold !
stronghold .
you steve's son?
yeah .
and he never mentioned me to you .
i don't ...
i don't think so .
makes sense .
that makes perfect sense , because the commander does not have time to sit around flipping through scrapbooks that i took the time to make for him .
no , the commander's got to be out there saving the world !
with your mom .
your mom .
she ever mention me?
uh ...
incoming !
oh , look .
he does glow .
i told you .
greetings .
little misfire in the mad science lab .
no need to panic , unless you're a single cell organism .
mr. medulla , we in hero support are trained never to panic .
my bad .
i'll get the nurse ... unless she's injured .
ah !
through being cool ]
change ... and ho !
now you .
go !
go !
go !
go !
go !
go back .
ok , number one .
a radioactive zombie is charging at your hero .
a ) his silver tipped crossbow ;
b ) a wooden spike ; c ) ...
yo , that's so weak , man .
i'm holding his crossbow .
why can't i shoot him myself?
'cause we're hero support .
and if your hero asks for a crossbow ,
you hand it to him .
or her .
by the way , zach , you can't kill a zombie .
you can only re kill him .
or her .
if you kids are all in here , who's out there saving the world?
dad .
why are you home so early?
after i stopped the superdome from collapsing ,
i was watching the game and got to thinking ,
it's been a while since will and i tossed the old pigskin around .
i thought i'd hustle back home , but i see you and layla have already made new friends .
it's an honor to meet you , sir .
what's your name , your power?
i'm ethan , and i melt .
ok .
zach .
i glow .
i see .
magenta .
i shape shift .
shape shift !
into a guinea pig .
great .
great .
great .
great !
really great .
well !
i make a mean tuna fish salad sandwich .
anybody want one?
no , no , no .
pleasure meeting everyone .
they're a good bunch of kids , will .
yeah .
can i ask you something , though?
does that one kid really , you know , glow?
sometimes .
boy , they have really lowered the bar some for superheroes at that school since i went there .
well , actually , he's a sidekick .
oh .
well , that makes sense .
yeah .
actually , they're all sidekicks .
good for you , son .
kid of your stature hangir out with a bunch of sidekicks .
as a freshman?
i didn't have the guts .
and i can only imagine what your grandfather would have said if i'd have brought some of them home .
you know , there's nothing wrong
with being a sidekick , dad .
oh , no .
of course not .
i used to have one .
saved my life once too .
old ... what's his name .
so then you would be fine with ... ... if i was a sidekick .
well , yeah , sure , i guess .
hey , hand me that mayonnaise there .
well , that's good then , because ... because i am .
am what?
a sidekick .
who is?
me , dad .
dad , i'm a sidekick , ok?
i washed out of power placement .
washed out !
boomer .
couldrt make the big time , so now he thinks he can pass judgment on some real heroes 'kids , huh?
oh , it's a power trip , will .
that's all it is .
sonic boom?
try " gym teacher man .
no , dad !
what are you doing?
i'm calling the school .
the tuition we pay them !
dad , don't .
dad !
it's not coach boomer !
it's me , ok?
i don't have any powers .
but you never said ...
i mean , you made it seem like ...
like i had super strength like you?
but i don't .
but you will , will !
you're just ...
you're just a late bloomer !
that's what it is !
maybe .
maybe not .
but i don't care .
because , really , the fact of the matter is
i'm proud to be a sidekick .
actually , i'm proud to be hero support .
uh , so i , uh , think we pretty much covered the undead .
what's next?
what?
your hero flies north at 300 miles per hour for 15 minutes .
his archenemy is tunneling south at 200 miles per hour for 10 minutes .
assuming your hero has x ray vision , how long before he realizes he's going the wrong way?
all i ever wanted for him was to save the world .
to just feel that once .
that's a lot to put on a 14 year old's shoulders .
oh , come on , josie !
when i was his age , i could put a truck on my shoulders .
oh !
honey , i know you're disappointed .
so am i. you think i didn't want to see my son fly?
or have super strength?
or fly?
but we can't change who he is .
not without dropping him in a vat of toxic waste .
steve !
aw ...
oh , no , no ...
where would we even find a vat of ...
steve !
i i just , i'm thinking .
will is a great kid .
this is not the end of the world .
ok .
so maybe we won't be the stronghold three , the greatest family of superheroes the world has ever known .
but we will be the stronghold three , the greatest family the world has ever known .
you're right .
you're right , and he can always go into real estate !
welcome to sky hi ...
come on , ron .
hey , big boy .
where's your hat?
hey , where's your hat?
if you're not gonna respect me , at least respect the hat !
oh , pfff !
guys .
guys , come on .
give ron his hat back .
all right .
you're the sidekick .
give him his hat back .
we'll catch you later , stronghold .
hey , race you up the steps .
thanks , will .
sure , ron .
over here !
saved you a seat !
hey , and i saved you a pudding !
hey , what's up?
hey , buddy .
check this out .
whoa !
uh ... sorry .
you will be .
let's not do this .
you think you can do whatever you want 'cause your name's stronghold?
i'm sorry my dad put your dad in jail , but ...
nobody talks about my father .
ah !
oh , it is so on !
fight , fight , fight !
mr. boy , do something !
i'm on it !
principal powers !
principal powers !
principal powers !
principal powers !
principal powers !
fight , fight , fight !
oooh !
hurry up !
move out of the way !
oh !
where are your sidekicks , sidekick?
right here !
yeah .
leave them alone !
he's strong !
i'm strong?
he's super strong .
yeah , will !
now , who tripped me?
stronghold !
what if i said it's not just her twin?
it's her evil twin .
this friday , you say?
medulla , you dog !
think i can't take a hit?
will !
will !
pull the pin !
he's comir , man !
hi .
i didn't do anything , though .
he started it .
your dad started it , and i'm gonna finish it .
don't bother .
the detention room neutralizes all super powers .
sit .
now , here at sky high we do everything we can to teach you how to use your powers .
but what you do with them , now that's up to you .
living up to your father's reputation or trying to live it down is a sad waste of talent .
your talent .
try to keep that in mind the next time you're about to do something stupid .
all right , look .
whatever happened with our dads , it has nothing to do with us .
what do you say?
i say if you ever cross me again , i'll roast you alive .
so , will , anything interesting happen at school today?
uh ...
well , as you may have noticed , i got my powers today !
yes , we know .
the principal called .
ok .
look , it's not ...
it's not as bad as it sounds .
it's a really funny , great story .

sanctum .

but i don't have an xbox .
are you sure?
oh !
go ahead .
when did you ...?
what?
open it up !
here .
here , i'll get it .
all right .
let's see .
the boy has stronghold's power .
it's almost poetic .
we should crush them now .
we know he has the weapon .
patience !
we have waited this long .
when the time is right , we'll have our revenge .
you know , time would move a lot faster if we had an xbox .
ah !
uncle !
uncle !
uncle !
dude , you made sidekick history !
aw .
i don't know about that .
dude , you made sidekick history !
aw .
i don't know about that .
no , seriously .
from now on , people mess with us at their own peril .
you're breaking down barriers , proving we're not heroes and sidekicks .
we're just people .
super people .
seats , please .
we have a lot to cover this morning , starting with motorcycle sidecar basics .
uh , except for you , mr. stronghold .
would you gather your gear and come up here , please?
i've got your new class schedule .
congratulations .
you've been transferred to the hero class .
oh , and by the way , if you should find yourself needing any hero support ,
i still do a little freelance .
ha !
ha !
but what about them?
we'll see you on the bus .
we'll hang at lunch .
right after you've dunked ethars head in the toilet .
well , you best not be late .
just go already .
rays !
from the silliness of the shrink ray to the devastation of the death ray .
these are the very foundations of mad science .
yes?
they told me you were coming .
unfortunately , all the lab partners are taken .
i suppose i could pair you with my teaching assistant .
miss grayson?
my apologies .
true ]
come on .
come on !
quickly , quickly , quickly .
feet !
you stepped on my foot !
ok , how's that?
perfect ... if you're building a heat ray .
you're supposed to be building a freeze ray .
ok , i have no idea what i'm doing .
dreadful technique .
you've confused rays with beams !
d !
minus !
i'd give you an f , but that would only mean having to see you in summer school .
and what have we here?
uh ...
well , i don't know .
i didn't do it .
you're far too modest , mr. stronghold .
or perhaps not modest enough .
miss grayson , in the future , please allow the students to succeed , or fail , on their own .
how did you do that?
i'm a technopath .
i can control technology with my mind .
wow .
all i can do is punch stuff .
yet he'll be the one on cereal boxes .
show me the justice in that .
miss fernandez , kindly thaw out mr. hellman .
that was amazing .
so is what you did in the cafeteria .
yeah .
once they start handing out grades for destruction of school property , i'll be in good shape .
you know , i can totally help you out with all this science stuff .
yeah , you'd do that?
mm hmm .
i could be , like , your ... private tutor .
cool .
guys !
guys !

man aims high .
gotta give him that .
sorry .

that is hilarious .
there they are .
gwen?
hey .
oh , uh , dad , this is gwen grayson .
gwen grayson , this is dad .
mr. stronghold , it's such an honor .
i'm sorry to barge in like this .
oh , not at all .
will and i were just hangir .
chillir .
honey , gwen is a technopath , and she's offered to help will with his science homework .
and she's a senior .
we said we'd work on that antigravity stuff tomorrow , but something came up .
any chance we can do it tonight?
sure .
yeah .
on one condition , gwen .
you join us for dinner .
oh , no , i couldn't intrude .
oh , yes , you can .
you must .
ok .
well , thanks .
so should we get started?
certainly .
well , she's gorgeous .
and she fixed the disposal .
really?
so there we were , in the middle of nowhere , and she's like , " i can't change a tire !
i can only change the weather !
i'm like , " can you at least make it stop raining?
uh , i'll give him a few more minutes .
so , gwen , do we know your parents?
mmm .
i don't think so , mrs. stronghold .
dad went inactive a few years ago .
lets mom do all the work now , huh?
mom passed away when i was a baby .
so i did have an ulterior motive in coming here tonight .
will told you i'm the head of the homecoming committee?
uh , he most certainly did not .
well , i was wondering if you'd consider attending the homecoming dance .
we would love to chaperone .
sure .
that's very nice , mrs. stronghold , but no .
we were hoping that you'd be the guests of honor and receive the award for heroes of the year .
still workir on that?
hey .
hey .
we go to school together .
you're stronghold's friend .
yeah .
yeah .
you want me to heat that up for you?
you're not supposed to use your powers outside of school .
i was just gonna stick it in the microwave .
uh , i was supposed to be meeting will here , but , um ...
you want to sit down?
i think i can spare a minute .
oh , look , hon .
there's ...
what's his name?
kid with the gravity .
lance , i think .
lance something .
yeah .
oh , my gosh , look .
there's boomer .
he had a mullet? !
oh , god .
oh , whoa whoa whoa .
remember her?
hmm?
she was a weird one .
oh , yeah .
sue tenny .
disappeared right before graduation .
why is that?
no one ever really knew .
some say she was , uh , recruiting villains at the school .
others say she was smoking in the girls 'room .
nightmare .
all right , now .
speaking of villains , there's one of the worst .
baron battle .
warrers dad?
always swore he'd have his revenge on me .
and he totally stole the lead in oklahoma !
you have to stop caring about that .
it's a long time ago .
hon.
don't wanna talk about it !
you deserved it .
then there was this time in first grade .
you know how you grow lima beans in school?
will could not figure out why mine grew so quickly .
it was driving him crazy .
so finally i took mercy on him and i told him about my powers , and we've been best friends ever since .
hmm .
and falling for him , was that before or after the lima beans?
what?
i am not in love with will strong ...
is it that obvious?
yeah .
great .
so why don't you tell him?
well , i was gonna ask him to homecoming , but there's two problems .
he likes somebody else , and she's perfect .
hmm .
you know what i think?
to let true love remain unspoken is the quickest route to a heavy heart .
wow .
that is really deep .
yeah .
and your lucky numbers are ... ... four , 16 , five and 49 .
i gotta go .
see you around , hippie .
you didn't have to walk me home .
true ]
i did if i wanted to spend any time alone with you .
and , just so you know ,
i don't usually hang out all night with my mom and dad .
your parents are great , will .
i'm so glad they're coming to homecoming .
now , if i could only find someone to go with .
you don't have a date for homecoming?
well , i've gotten a few offers , but ... ... i turned them down .
i'm just waiting for the right guy .
oh .
you , will .
me?
oh , hi , daddy .
bye , will .
bye .
you're not that boy with the six arms , are you?
no , sir .
just two .
well , keep them to yourself .
yes , sir .
good night , sir .
yes !
whoo !
oh , man !
ok .
here you go .
oh !

the greatest collection of superteens ever gathered to dance under one roof , and then we shall have our revenge !
there's only one thing we're missing !

last night , 8 : 00 , the paper lantern .

i don't remember that being the plan .
hey .

hey .

i feel extremely dangerous .
whoa .
whoa .
is this guy bothering you , magenta?
try the other way around .
does anyone else need a date for homecoming?
warren , you are crazy !
please , i promise .
i'll make this as painless as possible .
so you're not doir this just 'cause you like me or anything .
you're doir it to get to stronghold .

ooh , i don't know because , uh , my parents are on a distress call , and they won't be home till late .
i'm not supposed to have anyone here .
it's cool .
i was just hoping we could spend a little more time together , but ... ... i guess i'll just see you at school?

i think i'm just gonna call zach and layla , tell 'em to come over here because ...
will , you are such a nice guy .
but , honestly , do you think they'd have fun?
with this crowd?
i mean , don't you think they'd feel a little awkward?
no .
i think they'd be ok .
trust me .
they'd be miserable .
whoa !
hey !
sorry !
just lookir for a bucket !
i wish there was somewhere we could go to be alone .
um ... [ rock music plays in distance ]
wow .
this is incredible .
yep .
when you spend your whole life kicking butt and taking names ,
i guess you make a lot of memories .
well , maybe we should make a few of our own .
voices carry ]
what's she doing here?
isn't it past her bedtime?
hey , will?
could you go get me a diet caffeine free orange soda?
anything for you .
who invited a sidekick?
yeah , what's she doing here?
leaving .
where's will?
honestly?
avoiding you .
look , will knows you have a crush on him .
he does?
everyone does .
will's too nice to say he's not interested .
not that you can take a hint .
i mean , hello?
he's going to homecoming with me .
he threw a party and didn't invite you .
you're just embarrassing him .
you're just embarrassing yourself .
ok .
i understand .
and , um , when you see will again , can you tell him that i never want to talk to him again?
i'll give him the message .
layla .
layla !
layla !
layla !
layla !
have fun with gwen .
you two deserve each other .
gwen .
oh , thanks , will .
what did you say to layla?
nothing .
i mean , i just told her the truth .
you're a hero , she's a sidekick .
she was holding you back .
what?
why would you do that?
layla's been my best friend since first grade .
you've got new friends now , and i think that you need to figure out whether you want to hang with us or with those losers .
come on .
let's go .
no , forget it .
i'm not going anywhere with you , not now or not to homecoming .
might as well just find yourself a new date , gwen .
you're dumping me?
whoa whoa whoa , let's get something straight , ok?
you do not dump me !
not the night before the dance !
sorry , gwen .
i , uh , just did .
you're dumped !
that's it .
everyone , out !
party's over !
don't stop on our account .
your father and i fly to europe for two hours , and you throw a party?
unbelievable .
when i reach the count of three , i want everyone out of this house !
son , i'm only going to ask you this ...
dad , i swear , i didn't plan this .
all right .
that's good enough for me .
hmm?
steve , i have got half a mind not to let him go to homecoming .
that's fine .
i'm not going anyway .
whoa whoa whoa whoa .
your mom said she had " half a mind .
will , you have to go to the homecoming dance .
we all have to because we're introducing the world to the stronghold three , the greatest family of superheroes mankind has ever known .
did something happen , will?
i don't want to talk about it .
well , we're gonna talk about it because ... ... we promised gwen we'd go to the dance !
and when a stronghold makes a promise , son , that promise is kept !
i promise you , dad , i'm not going .
hello?
layla?
pick up , layla .
pick up , pick up , pick up .
fine , don't pick up .
it's me .

you're so funny .
i love life !
thanks , boom , for inviting me .
ha ha ha .
you'll like this one .
it was the spring of '88 ...
layla .
layla , just pick up .
in case you didn't get my earlier messages ,
i'm at the paper lantern , and i ...
message box full .
what are you doing here?
i'm , uh , looking for layla .
do you know where she is?
how should i know?
you're taking her to homecoming .
oh , yeah .
right .
well , you don't have to worry about me ruining your night .
and why is that?
because i'm not going .
hmm .
well , that sucks .
because we're only going together to make you jealous .
huh?
dude , you're so stupid .
she's totally into you .
not after tonight .
i wouldn't be surprised if layla or any of the other guys
ever want to talk to me again .
yeah .
you must have been a real jerk .
because no matter what i do ,
i can't get 'em to stop talking to me .
thanks .
one thing leads to another ]
hey , you want to dance?
no .
me neither .
hey there , layla .
you look like you could use a drink .
no , thanks .
oh , don't worry .
the bubbles are just ginger ale .
oops .
the guys at this school are jerks !
thanks a lot .
i thought you werert gonna rent a tux .
it's my dad's .
he doesn't have much use for it in solitary .
cheese cube?
we're taking off now , hon .
still time to change your mind and come with us .
nah , i don't think so .
mom , you ever feel like you messed something up so bad that you'll never be able to fix it?
people make mistakes , will .
that's what high school's about .
heck , that's what life's about .
the key is to learn from them .
i hope my friends see it that way .
if someone is a true friend , you'd be surprised at how understanding they can be .
thanks .
do me a favor?
put this away for me .
i caught your father sneaking it out under his cape .
he's convinced that everyone wants to reminisce with him .
i bet .
will do .
love ya .
have fun .
that's weird .
gwen?
oh , no .
oh , no .
oh , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no .
i gotta get to sky high .
josie , wait .
we can't unveil the stronghold three without will .
it's just ... it's just not the same .
maybe we should fly home .
and we really don't need another award .
welcome , commander and jetstream !
good evening .
first , a quick announcement .
the owner of the blue cold fusion powered jet pack , you left your lights on .
sorry .
sorry .
excuse me .
sorry .
and now , please help me welcome the head of the homecoming committee , the girl who made all this possible , gwen grayson .
thank you , principal powers .
and a very special thank you goes to our guests of honor and the recipients of our first ever hero of the year award ,
the commander and jetstream .
and to mark this occasion , we've planned a special tribute to the most powerful super being ever to walk the halls of sky high .
me !
commander?
royal pain is a girl?
yes , i'm a girl , you idiot !
how i ever lost to a fool like you i'll never know .
now prepare to be pacified !
do you honestly think you can kill me with that little toy gun of yours?
my dear commander , who said anything about killing you?
ahhh !
josie !
i've always ...
rock a bye , baby !
what'd i miss?
ah !
boomer !
get the kids out of here !
hothead !
find an exit !
get as many people out as you can !
i'll slow her dow ... !
thanks again for the lift , ron .
now , if i'm not back in 30 minutes ...
come in after you !
got it !
i was gonna say go get help .
go get help .
got it !
now get in there !
sorry !
where are we?
hey , warren , how 'bout a torch?
only if you want to get barbecued .
ladies , if i may .
then all the reindeer loved him
way to glow , zach .
thanks , man .
'sup , kid?
you're never gonna believe this .
gwen ...
is royal pairs daughter .
yeah , and she ...
stole the pacifier .
right .
she turned everybody into babies , including your parents .
ok .
that i didn't know .
this is even more than the great will stronghold can handle .
she's right .
it's gonna take all of us .
all of who?
you and warren?
the rest of us are only sidekicks .
just because you have powers , that doesn't make you a hero .
sometimes it just makes you a jerk .
makes me a jerk .
i guess what i'm trying to say is ...
we get it .
you've been a jerk .
layla , in case my homecoming date ends up killing me tonight ,
i just want you to know ...
isn't that sweet?
i hate sweet !
you guys are a part of this too?
why am i not surprised?
go take care of gwen .
we'll handle these clowns .
go .
whoa !
while pushing down on the infant restraint , pinch the two straps together .
pinch , royal , pinch .
pinch what?
restraint a or b?
now you just calm down .
let's go back to one .
ahhh !
come back and fight !
you ...
come on , sidekick !
you gonna fight back?
i don't believe in using powers for violence .
i don't believe you even have any powers !
go , penny !
beat layla !
go , penny !
beat layla !
you can't hide forever , sidekick !
no way .
sucks for you !
cootchie cootchie coo !
i take you back , my dear commander , to your senior year at sky high , a time before anyone knew what a technopath was .
so a brilliant but misunderstood girl named sue tenny was written off as a science geek and stuck in sidekick class .
she hatched a plan , so daring , so visionary , to start her very own supervillain academy and raise a generation of heroes from scratch as villains .
but first she had to destroy the very institution that dared to spurn her genius !
and now , so many years later , that plan is complete .
that this may be the finest supervillain speech ever given , and you don't even know what i'm saying .
but i do .
look .
i'm sorry that my parents destroyed your mom .
now put my dad down .
no one could defeat royal pain .
when the pacifier exploded , i wasrt destroyed .
i was merely turned into a baby .
stitches took me away and raised me as his daughter .
daddy's little girl .
i told you never to call me that !
lunatic !
that's right .
royal pain wasrt my mother .
royal pain is me !
oh , my god .
i made out with an old lady .
yoo hoo !
right here !
whoa , whoa , whoa !
way to go , popsicle .
hmm !
big mistake .
but i thought you were a sidekick !
i am a sidekick .
don't leave us here to die !
royal pain sabotaged the antigravity device !
the whole school's gonna fall out of the sky !
we only have 10 minutes !
here's the antigravity room .
didrt royal pain seal off every route?
what about this conduit?
right .
you'd have to be like a rat to fit in there .
oh , great .
this is so stupid .
ok .
ok , you're doir great , magenta .
looks great .
look at those cute little legs .
ok , go about 10 feet .
yeah , there should be a opening on your right .
gotcha !
find the access panel .
what?
it leads to the generator .
i'm on it !
will !
no !
and there goes your last chance of stopping me .
we'll see about that !
huh?
surprised?
so am i.
you're flying?
that's impossible !
ah !
there's only one person authorized to transport superheroes .
and that's ron wilson , bus driver .
and i'm ron wilson , bus driver .
i found the generator ...
i think .
chew the wire to the scrambler .
cut the wire connected to the scrambler .
the red one .
what?
cut the red wire !
there's a lot of red wires down here .
uh oh .
the school is falling !
ahhh !
chew !
chew the wire !
all unpacked , and the movers didn't break a thing .
told you we didn't need that extra insurance .
no , i know .
oh , no !
it's all on you !
hold me !
hold me !
ahhh !
whoa .
that could have been messy .
good night .
ohh !
chester?
chester?
now what?
beats me .
perhaps i can be of assistance .
it should only take me a couple of hours to reconfigure the pacifier .
mr. peace , would you please carry me to the mad science lab?
sure .
and , mr. peace .
yeah .
regrettably , i have made boom boom .
people , if you've already been de pacified , please find your clothes , grab a baby and report to the science lab .
mom?
dad?
guys?
i just want to say sorry because this whole thing was my fault .
honey , you can't blame yourself .
'course not .
how were you supposed to know your girlfriend was a psychopath?
no , that's not it .
um , you gave me one rule , and i broke it .
i took her into the sanctum , and that's how she got the pacifier .
the whole party was a trap .
and so was the homecoming , will .
we all fell into royal pairs trap , but you defeated her .
you saved sky high , and everyone in her .
i didn't do it by myself .
excuse me .
steve?
josie?
even though it appears gwen only came up with this award as a way to lure you to the dance and your ultimate doom , still it's inscribed , so ...
i'd be honored to accept this " hero of the year " award .
but i'm afraid this doesn't belong to us .
it belongs to them .
the sidekicks .
i mean , hero support .
why don't we just call them what they really are , josie?
heroes .
oh , and , jonathan?
whatever you're teaching them , keep teaching them it .
sure .
what a waste .
i can't do anything more to help you .
i'm not wonder woman , you know .
i went through puberty twice ... for this?
i have de pacified all the babies and destroyed that horrible weapon forever .
let's boogie !
melt with you ]
this is so sweet , i could hurl .
tell me about it .
do you wanna dance?
yes !
i mean , yeah .
yeah .
compared to homecoming , the rest of the year was pretty boring .
gwen and her gang got what they deserved .
but now nobody wants to save the citizen .
uncle !
uncle !
relax .
i'm just kidding .
but they are getting to spend a lot of quality time together .
oh , yeah , and ron wilson , bus driver , fell into a vat of toxic waste .
he now works for the mayor , defending the city from giant robots .
so in the end , my girlfriend became my archenemy , my archenemy became my best friend and my best friend became my girlfriend .
but , hey , that's high school .
save it for later ]
