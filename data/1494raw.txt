you know the chief's gonna kill us , right?
let me give you guys a little tip .
lf you're going to operate outside the channels ... do the whole renegade cop thing ... you might want to make sure that you get the right guy .
chief , we almost had the guy .
our intelligence was just a little off .
wait a minute . lntelligence?
look around you , copeland .
there's nothing intelligent about this .
now i'm tired of your escapades .
i want them to stop .
the last thing i need is to be the laughingstock of the bureau .
and furthermore , the
hold on .
hello?
baby , i can't talk .
the chief is chewing my ass right now .
i got to call you back .
bye .
sorry , chief .
as i was saying
gordon here .
yes , he is .
it's for you .
thank you .
baby , i'm still with the chief .
no respect .
no , he's really not happy now .
okay , i got to go .
bye .
thanks , chief .
you guys are ....
get this place cleaned up .
i expect to have a full report on my desk tomorrow .
yes , sir .
and in the meantime ...
i'm checking with the bureau to see if they got any openings ... in lraq .
the dynamic duo strikes again .
way to go , baskin and robbin .
or is it hag and dazs?
hag and dazs .
you wrote that?
that's good , i like that .
later , hag .
adis , dazs .
i hate those guys , dude .
oh , god .
all right .
well , let's get this place cleaned up .
all right .
okay , so , you do the floor .
clean all the ice cream up and i'll go warm the car up .
okay .
so much for a hot meal .
hey , baby .
don't " hey , baby " me .
i can't believe you have me sitting here all night worried about you .
all night?
baby ... it's only 8 : 00 .
look , after work , me and kevin went down to the bar and had a couple of drinks .
i know .
i called the bar .
they said you left at 7 : 45 .
i checked mapquest .
it only takes six minutes to get there from here .
so , if you got somebody on the side , you need to tell me .
baby , listen to what you just say .
mapquest said it takes six minutes to get here .
i got here in eight .
which means there's two minutes unaccounted for .
lf i was cheating on you , don't you think i'd need more than two minutes?
you know what?
i ain't going to deal with this .
i'm tired , okay?
i had a long day at work .
i got shot at .
see , that is exactly what i'm talking about .
we don't communicate .
okay , fine .
you want to communicate?
yes .
come on .
let's communicate .
okay?
okay .
let's start with last week .
last week .
you and i were supposed to go shopping together .
we get to the mall .
i buy this beautiful dress , i get my hair done .
you don't say anything .
i don't know , maybe you just don't want to ....
did you hear me just now?
tell me what i said .
i heard everything .
you was communicating .
don't play with me right now .
i am not in the mood .
i cannot believe you came home late and then you start ....
marcus !
you are falling asleep again .
i am talking to you .
i wasn't asleep , i was closing my eyes and visualizing your words .
oh , really?
visualizing?
why don't you paint me a picture of what i just said?
hold on .
you know why?
because you are falling asleep again .
marcus !
we received this from mr. andrew wilson , ceo of wilson cruise lines .
it was delivered to his home .
the girls in the photo are his daughters ... and heiresses to the wilson fortune .
we believe they are the kidnapper's next victims .
mr. wilson has given us permission to shadow his daughters .
we're going to set up surveillance ... and if the kidnapper strikes ... this time we will be ready .
now , the wilson sisters will be flying into jfk this morning .
so who's going to pick them up?
obviously , everyone has read the profile on the girls .
still , somebody's got to do it .
i don't think this is a good idea .
i don't care .
we deserve to be on this case just as much as gomez and harper .
i know , but we don't want to interrupt the man in a briefing .
well , somebody got to stand up to him .
chief .
what?
marcus has something he want to tell you .
what?
chief , we just want to know if we could get on the case .
you're on .
the boys over at lntel seem to think that the kidnapper's a guy ... named ted burton .
it says burton was a partner of wilson's ... and some other associates in some business venture that failed .
says he spent time in the federal pen and lost his fortune .
guy's been mla since his release and those dates coincide with the first kidnappings .
what do you think?
i think this babysitting gig sucks .
dude , relax .
look , man .
all we got to do is pick these chicks up ... drop their ass off in the hamptons , then we back in the chief's good graces .
i didn't join the fbl to become a nanny .
i want to be on the street where the action is .
okay , blackie chan , and you'll get there .
can we just do this first , please?
all right .
you didn't put dairy in this , did you?
no .
because you know i'm lactose intolerant .
last time , i barely made it to the bathroom .
why would i want to disturb your stomach?
there goes your girls .
come on , man .
let's do this .
hi , i'm kevin copeland .
this is  we already gave to the united negro fund .
wait .
hold on .
excuse us .
we're actually here to escort you ladies to the hamptons .
the bags are on the plane .
take baby and clean out his bag .
he didn't have his colonic and he like pooped everywhere .
what's this?
baby got to ride in the car seat .
where the hell am i supposed to sit?
this ain't right .
man , you guys sure got a lot of bags for a weekend .
this isn't a weekend .
it's the weekend .
labor day in the hamptons .
the last weekend of the social season .
only the hottest people are going to be there .

do you have any more of that?
don't hate me because you ain't me .
can i have your attention , please?
gentlemen , get out your wallets ... because you'll be bidding on a date ... with some of hamptons 'most eligible bachelorettes .

they're actually auctioning off women .

i see , so you like rich guys?
it might be a pleasant change from all the losers that ask me out . $3, 000 .
that's good .
i see .
but i think that we can do better than that . $20, 000 .
sold . $20, 000 .

yeah , i got $2, 000 right here .
$3, 000 . $5, 000 .
who said that?
$5, 000 to the dirty geezer in the back .
i'm sure no one will wish to go higher than that ... so we can just be done with it now . $10, 000 . $20, 000 .
$20, 000 !
going once , going twice $50, 000 .

what does it mean ... when a guy is in a really bad relationship ... and it's really obvious that he wants to be with you ... but he just can't seem to break up with his girlfriend?

don't act like you haven't done it before .
you know how it is when you really care about someone .
you call them all day long ... because you just wanna know how their day is going ... and what they're thinking about and if they're thinking about you .
you spend all day trying to find the perfect outfit .
you even change your hairstyle just so he'll take a second look .
but they never notice .
sometimes i just wish that they could trade places with us ... so that they would know how it feels .
you know?
all done .

girl , it's late !
come on , now .
you have to go home .

i'm telling you , she will stay here and just clean forever .
this is really nice .
yeah , this is dope .
dope summer home i picked , boy .

don't pay him no mind .
he's just going to do that until he falls asleep .
now , where were we?

you know , i like a woman with a little extra something .
a little cushion for the pushing .
i'd really love for you to come to one of my games .
no , thank you .
i've seen you play .
not impressed .
excuse me?
i'm the highest scoring forward in the league !
but all that talent?
totally overshadowed by nothing but scandals and pure laziness .
come on !
you're shooting under 50 % from the free throw line , okay?
your turnover ratio , abysmal .
and on top of that , you can't shoot three pointers to save your life .
so ... squeeze me .
no one's ever cared like that before .
come here , baby !
oopsie !
i had a poopsie .
girl , we're going to get along just fine .
back at you !
bask in the ambience !
i'm going to be sick .
so , no .
i jump over the fence , fall .
i scrape my knee .
get out of here .
no , seriously , listen .
i scrape my knee .
i get chased by the cops and i spend the night in jail .
that's insane .
you did all that just to find j lo and ben's hideaway?
i can't help it .
you know , investigative journalism is my passion .
so how'd you end up writing puff pieces for the local news?
unfortunately , i made some enemies ... and ended up getting fired from my last job .
what happened?
believe me , you don't want to know about that .
look , i spent all night talking about myself .
sometimes it's good for a man to just sit back and listen .
well , since you put it that way .
i did this piece on warren vandergeld .
him and his partners tried to swindle a guy .
you talking about ted burton?
yeah , how did you know that?
it was in the paper .
i read about it .
but what they didn't report in the paper ... was that burton was 10 times smarter than all of them .
he embezzled millions and stashed it in an offshore account .
when vandergeld heard the story was going to break ... he didn't want to be embarrassed .
well , there goes my job .
you know , you're a good listener .
it seems like you have the whole package .
man !
hello?
kev , you got to go .
what?
now?
yeah , now .
we're on our way .
can't you stall him for a little while?
look , this man sang to me .
he tried to kiss me and on top of that ... he been farting for the last 20 minutes .
all right , i'll be there in a minute .
bye .
cottontail !
i'm coming , nigger !

little miss vandergeld walks in ... and he just forgets all about me .
okay , let it out .
i wonder ... if he would think she was so hot ... if he knew that she is broke .
vandergeld's broke?
we mustn't talk of such things .
no , we won't .
but , yes , they're broke .
my father even had to loan her father money ... just so that they could keep their house .
they just paid us back .

you're right .
you're absolutely right .
i've been selfish .
i'm always dragging you into everything .
i never even asked what you want to do .
i don't know , there's something about always having you around , that just ... makes me want to step up my game .
i guess it's because i always know you're gonna have my back .

i'm guilty of paying more attention to my job than i do my wife .
i'm guilty of not appreciating all the little things you do for me .
like getting your hair done .

making my way downtown walking fast

but we was only doing our job .
i hope you guys aren't too pissed off at us .
