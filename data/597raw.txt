the jaguar
take it easy , boys !
he's too tired to talk now .
your reservation's confirmed .
welcome to the crillon hotel , mr. stevens .
your suite is ready .
i think your cause is important .
4th floor .
what floor?
3rd .
we'll get help at once .
nothing serious .
ok , thanks .
they'll have it fixed in a jiffy .
sorry about that .
no harm done .
whatever turns him on .
we're trapped here with you know who .
he's fondling one of the guests .
the ears .
ok , thanks .
they're done .
good !
i'm claustrophobic .
just a few seconds now .
don't worry , he's a very gentle fellow .
i'm not worried .
now what?
grab his nose .
the nose is the breath of life .
you're saying that your lives matter to one another .
really?
how long will we be saying this?
so much for that !
this is incredible .
why?
you're the 1 st white man who's interested him .
he has a nice face .
he's a respected shaman of the amazon rainforest .
it's about time !
'night .
keep up the good work .
thanks .
sorry if he bothered you .
forget it .
so long .
i really am sorry .
i don't know what's got into him .
that's all right .
goodnight .
late , as usual .
i have an excuse .
let's hear it .
a shaman grabbed my nose in the elevator .
right !
it's true !
that rainforest guy on the world tour ...
you look great .
why'd you call me?
had to see you .
after a year , you suddenly have to see me?
what's this?
i'm saying your life matters to me .
photo op at 9 , government meeting at 11 , then we'll do afternoon talk shows .
what's that?
what'd he want?
he had a bad dream last night .
a man in the amazon stole his soul .
he couldn't prevent it , since he was so far away .
so he had a bad night .
he'll get over it .
i'm right down the hall .
this dream stuff bothers me .
it'll be forgotten by the morning !
he said something odd .
what?
that he'd met the " chosen one .
chosen one?
how much?
100, 000 .
dollars?
i'm on to a big score .
i'll pay you back next week .
what's so funny?
so that's why you called me !
i wanted to see you , not tell you my problems !
it's late , tomorrow's a big day , and i'm beat !
ok , i'll leave !
can i get dressed first?
anna?
you asleep?
look , i'm in deep shit .
i lost at poker , wrote bum checks .
so what else is new?
it gets heavy .
the guy i owe sold my debt to a loan shark in the mob !
i'm sleepy .
i don't believe this !
my life's in danger and you're sleepy !
you asked everyone else , right?
not at all !
even if i had $100, 000 , you wouldn't see it !
it's fake .
why say that?
just a thought .
franois !
why don't you try working for a change?
goodnight , sir .
what're you doing here?
aren't you cold?
you're shivering !
they let you out half naked !
put this on !
put it on !
you'll catch your death !
let's go in .
now what?
that's nice , but i couldn't ...
happy now?
come on .
found him outside .
isn't he guarded?
he's your problem .
i'm outta here .
gimme the coat .
you take the beads , i take the coat .
this is too tricky .
get the damn interpreter , i want my coat .
it's 4 a . m .
i didn't ask the time .
my coat is cashmere !
who needs these crappy beads?
ok , i'll call at once .
no , thanks .
goddam trading post !
terribly sorry .
he's never gone out alone .
i want to have my coat ... and give these back .
that's a tough one !
why?
if you've initiated the gift ritual ...
what ritual?
i'm not into ritual !
to take a gift back is a major insult .
what gift?
it's cold , i lent him my coat .
now i need it to go home .
tell this bozo to stop !
a fertility necklace !
it's a sign of respect .
i want my coat now ... or else !
i'll get my checkbook .
what for?
to buy the coat .
he can't imagine a friend taking it back .
what have i done?
tell me how much i owe you .
never mind !
it's out of your league .
keep it .
i need way more cash than that !
i'm very touched , sir .
my name's jean campana .
do i get my keys back?
does he keep my car?
i said it was your fetish .
nice move !
goodnight .
no !
you stay !
you not come !
put him on a leash so i can split !
you scared me !
what're you doing?
don't move !
crillon hotel?
mr campana , please .
damn !
it's the guy with the coat .
yeah , right .
i got your cuckoo here .
at my place .
didn't see him till i parked !
i'm sick of this shit !
make it snappy .
95 suffren ave .
the name's franois perrin .
i'll buzz you in .
see you soon .
bozo's in a bad way !
stop following me !
what's with you?
stop it !
try to warm up .
you don't keep the blanket !
damn !
you'll have coffee then go home , ok?
what a night !
i go out for big bucks , come back with an old indian !
i'm a loser .
i'm up the creek .
100 grand !
go for it !
it's not so great .
comes from the deli downstairs .
you don't care .
what's up , geronimo?
why am i your friend?
still hungry?
it's a quiche .
it's lousy , but the deli lets me buy on credit .
you don't know about debts , credit ratings , collection agencies ...
where's your interpreter?
i'm not bored , i'm bushed .
have a coffee for the road .
i got some brandy .
keep the chill off .
strong , huh?
what's keeping him?
is he coming by canoe?
damn , i'm sleepy !
i gotta lie down .
no one home?
we get it wrong?
no , franois perrin , 6th floor .
what's he up to?
let's call the police .
who is it?
you can take him .
what are you staring at?
take him and get lost !
sorry , but we came by earlier ...
i fell asleep .
he's all yours , goodbye !
will he go now?
i'll handle it .
thanks for coming , it's alright now .
you're sure?
yes , thanks .
i'll be in the car .
i'll reschedule the day .
alright !
what happened?
i don't know .
and i don't care !
talk outside .
i'm crashing !
i asked him why he painted symbols on your face .
he did what?
shit !
the guy's nuts !
he says you're good .
your soul's clear and beautiful .
so why the paint?
looks like an initiation rite to me .
those totems and crosses on your face .
that's what it looks like .
tell him to do his graffiti elsewhere !
i wish i knew .
now what?
he thanks you for the gifts .
he should !
don't wash off the paint for a few days .
oh , sure !
he says you're the chosen one .
right .
he has chosen you , mr perrin .
but what for?
only you can help .
yeah , sure !
see you around , good luck .
goodbye , thanks for everything .
wait !
someone stole his soul .
know what that means to an indian?
who cares?
see you again , mr. stevens thank you , minister .
france cares about the amazon rainforest and its inhabitants .
we'll do our best to help .
goodbye , minister .
what's the matter?
get a doctor , quick !
11 o'clock news .
wanu , the amazon shaman suffered a heart attack a few minutes ago .
wanu is touring europe to publicize the plight of the rainforest and its natives .
he's in critical condition at a paris hospital .
he wants perrin .
i heard it on the radio .
how is he?
he's dying , wants to see you .
sorry , i can't come to the hospital now .
look , it won't take long .
i can send a car .
no , i'm tied up today .
why me?
i only met him last night .
it's crazy !
he's formed a mysterious bond with you .
it's rooted in indian magic .
indian magic !
i saved him from freezing .
where's the magic?
hey , i got water on my floor !
a flood !
shit !
he hung up !
what's happening?
valium?
valium 10 , quick !
you got a week to pay up .
no more .
we'll be visiting you .
see you around .
a week !
i don't get it .
he was clinically dead , now he needs valium !
i've never given a sedative to a stiff !
who did you sell my iou to?
you shoulda paid , it's been a year .
they just beat me up .
tell me who it is !
you won't lose them .
they'll make you pay .
i can't , goddammit , i need time !
if you can't , then beat it .
skip town , blow the country , the planet !
why doesn't he call?
he won't give a few minutes to a dying man !
it's too late .
i'm going ...
where?
to get him .
to drag him here?
you bet i will .
hi !
now what?
you gave me a week .
just checking on your mood .
mr perrin , i need a few minutes of your time ...
sure !
thanks for coming .
least i could do .
please .
there was another scare .
his heart was racing .
he wants you to get his soul .
what?
his soul's been stolen .
without it he'll die .
you must retrieve it .
time is running out .
you two are bonded .
he'll help you search .
will you go or not?
yes .
thanks for playing along .
i pity the old guy .
he's happy , he thinks you'll rescue his soul and he'll recover .
you must think this is ridiculous .
it is unusual .
indians believe you die unless someone recovers your soul .
fine , but why me?
i don't know .
thanks again for your trouble .
i bet the amazon is really something .
what?
i haven't had a vacation for ages , and a few days over there ...
you'd consider going?
i have a few loose ends to tie up and if it all works out ...
i had no idea you might go .
why not?
sounds fun .
no , it's not " fun .
it would be no pleasure trip .
recovering a soul is a ritual .
it is long and arduous .
indian magic is no holiday .
i understand .
how interesting .
i admit i'm tempted ...
it's a spiritual journey .
spiritual , sure ...
i'm seeing a guy today who's crucial ...
i'll see him and then decide , ok?
that's him .
his name's matecamu .
what?
matecamu .
he's serb , or croat , or bosnian ...
who cares?
anyway , it's gotta be him , his specialty is buying up gambling debts .
mr matecamu , can i talk to you?
my name's franois perrin , i think we're in business .
i'm an honest man .
i always pay my debts , i have principles .
i owe you $100, 000 .
i swear i'll pay you .
but i need more time , 2 weeks at most ...
what do you do?
sorry?
you have a job?
i'm in deluxe real estate , in the balearic islands .
i have a property you may like .
by the sea , pool and tennis court ...
let's talk about it when we've settled our problem .
i have a son like you .
really?
same age , same charm , same gall .
is that so?
the creep has bugged me since he was born .
he's a liar , a thief , a skirt chaser , a drunk , and maybe a junkie .
he's dumb enough .
i'm not into drugs !
i'd love to murder him , but his mother protects him .
there's nothing i can do .
could i talk to him?
youth to youth ...
shaddup !
ok .
you get no more time .
pay up by the end of the week .
that's impossible .
i'll tell them you need special care .
as if you were my own son .
indians are wonderful , i lived with them all my life .
my parents were anthropologists .
i was ten when they died .
i was raised by the tribe .
have a nice trip .
thanks .
time for a coffee before takeoff .
not for me .
i'll be at the gate .
you're not leaving .
here's $10, 000 .
i sold my car , it's all i have .
give me my passport .
you owe $100, 000 .
i'll be back in a week , i'll pay you then .
i swear !
stop , i'll pay you !
i swear !
stop !
you're leaving in a wheelchair !
you ok?
who taught you to fight?
who were those guys?
no idea .
they followed us from paris .
i saw their car .
how odd .
that'll teach them not to steal .
we stop in rio .
i know someone in rio !
a babe i met in a disco !
she's hot !
she gave me her number .
hope i've got it .
she may have a chick for you !
we only have an hour to make the flight to the amazon .
wanu gave me this for you .
wear it around your neck .
around your neck !
you hear me , perrin?
sure , around my neck .
it's of great spiritual value .
take it out of your pocket .
a million for the new ferrari !
what a powerhouse !
what's with you?
think of your mission .
i am !
give me the pouch .
what pouch?
oh , yeah .
you never asked what's in it .
so i'll ask .
what's in the pouch?
rock crystals containing the spirits of the forests and rivers .
glad i asked .
perrin ...
you're hurting me !
believe in it .
i will , but don't break my arm !
you're leaving paris because you're in a bind .
don't try to run out on me .
never occurred to me !
happy now?
never take it off , it's how wanu sends you his strength .
what's so funny?
wanu's strength ...
he weighs 75lbs ...
and right now , the poor guy ...
don't kid yourself , wanu is very strong .
it's spiritual .
the indians call him the jaguar .
he has its power and speed .
some claim he can become a jaguar at will .
you believe that crap?
i don't know .
but it does more for me than your $1 million ferrari .
it's no venice !
matupa's a goldrush town .
it can get mean .
we're here one night .
you can find gold here?
not you .
it's hard work .
what is it?
that's kumare's plane .
who?
scenery's improving .
her guy's a killer .
so are his guards !
ok , forget it .
an indian worse than white trash .
i just like his chick .
the asshole did it on purpose !
he knows i fight to rid the forest of his kind .
he's a disaster for the whole planet !
spare me the greenpeace crap .
i like the chick's ass ...
this is the main street .
they all dig for gold?
most of them , yes .
do they ever play poker , to relax?
forget it , perrin .
that's the hotel?
the best place in town .
passport .
not very fancy , but for one night ...
no , it's charming .
don't worry , tomorrow we'll be in the forest .
it's so beautiful !
you get around a lot?
what?
no , i bet it's great .
wanu's village is 2 days by canoe .
it's hot , there's mosquitoes ... but it's fabulous .
i can't wait .
we shower and meet in the bar?
right , see you later .
when's the next flight to rio?
what?
what time ...?
next plane , fly to rio?
one hour .
can i have my passport?
mr campana take passports .
campana?
mine , too?
what's his room?
he not in room .
everything ok?
siesta time?
yep .
awesome river !
you got our passports?
yes .
good .
they shouldn't lie around .
weird hammock .
so where is it?
what?
my passport .
in my pocket .
i want to see the town .
i need my id .
do i get my goddam passport?
get those crystals out of the trash can , asshole !
here's your junk , gimme my passport !
you volunteered , you're staying !
i'm outta here , and fast .
i'll find you and kill you .
would i search the jungle to find a soul?
armed with a butterfly net?
this is the 20th century !
forest spirits , wizards who become jaguars , that's over !
why did wanu pick you?
beats me , too .
passport !
i'll make a bundle here to cover my air fare .
you'll get a bonus .
i got one on the plane .
what? $10, 000 .
it fell out of your pocket .
pays for your trip and helps the cause .
gimme back my dough !
it's in my pocket .
try and get it .
lucky we're not alone .
want to fight?
i'll find a quiet spot .
i won't fight you .
only jerks fight !
i'm splitting , gimme some money .
where're you going?
to see the town .
i'll come too .
i'd rather be alone .
i can't take that risk .
you got me reined in , but don't ride me !
it's a rough town if you don't know it .
even if you do !
i'm shaking .
gimme some of my dough !
don't stay out late .
you sound like my dad .
he was stingy , too .
if you get in a jam , call me !
right !
that !
the beer or the girl?
cold beer or warm girl?
you're not sure?
i don't understand .
he asks if you want the girl or the bottle .
he's a joker .
laugh or he'll head butt you .
buy me a drink?
sure .
i'm from bordeaux .
and you?
paris .
two beers .
watch out !
guy in white is kumare .
know him?
i've heard of him .
ogle his chick and he'll blind you .
i want no trouble .
me neither .
i drink my beer and bug no one .
they're machete happy here .
it's on the floor with your head .
no shit .
it happened to a buddy of mine .
he's at the bar , then his head's looking up at him !
sliced clean off with a machete .
here's to you " .
got as far as " here's ... " , his head was gone .
it stopped rolling and said , " to you .
what's he say?
where you get the pouch?
pouch?
i was given it .
why?
his boss wants to buy it .
how much you want?
how much?
i don't know .
it's just a charm .
he's getting mad .
a price , quick !
what's it worth?
it's not mine to sell !
make a deal .
i'm outta here .
hand it over , or our heads will be history !
don't be a jerk !
police !
is mr perrin back?
no .
who's that fax for?
i dunno .
go see .
it's for you .
he's had another attack , looks critical .
i'll keep you posted .
when i get a fax , tell me !
rest , you're safe here .
nothing can happen to you , i'll protect you .
i'm at your side .
rest .
he's sick , father .
kumare wants to kill us .
help us , father .
get back !
so?
he's ok .
great , i knew he'd make it .
i won't go to bed till that fool's back .
he went off this afternoon .
no word since .
what a jerk !
where is he?
hello .
my head !
i drank too much .
ok , we had a ball , now i gotta go .
don't scream !
where can i get a taxi?
ok , here ...
knock it off !
i don't get you !
oh my god !
i hustled the killer's woman .
i'm nuts !
your guy knows?
where is he?
you scared me !
what are you doing here?
we'll talk on the way .
i guess i picked her up ...
i must've been smashed ...
come on !
hurry !
what got into me?
hustling another man's babe !
a killer's , too !
did he see us?
she could say she was with a girlfriend .
he saw you and is out to kill you both .
really .
get in !
you fought both of kumare's bodyguards .
i did?
you mangled the bloodiest killer in the amazon .
i did what?
she says you were in a trance .
what's this bullshit?
where's your friend?
what friend?
the gringo you were with in the bar .
i hardly know him .
he just bought me a beer .
who is he?
i don't know , i swear it .
he's french , that's all i know !
he bought me a beer .
who is he?
i was drugged .
that's it .
the barkeep spiked my drink ...
nobody drugged you , you were in a trance .
he entered you , you had his strength !
he helped you fight !
from his hospital bed .
it's fantastic !
no !
now we'll get wanu's soul back and he'll survive .
i don't want to !
i won't be possessed by some indian !
i won't become his zombie !
i refuse to believe this crap !
i want out !
take me to the airport .
perrin , listen ...
our deal wasn't for trances or killers on my tail !
i'm leaving , take me to the airport !
can that jerk fix it?
damn bugs !
what's she doing?
looking for plants .
plants?
we're on the lam and she picks flowers?
they're for you .
i didn't ask her !
they repel mosquitoes .
you'd be eaten alive .
what's her name?
maya .
why's she with kumare?
he slaughtered her family , then kidnapped her .
nice country .
what'll you do with her?
keep him from finding her .
she should go to new york , paris ...
with her looks , she'd do ok .
as a hooker , you mean?
no .
new clothes , make up , she'd be a top model .
think so?
she'd wind up on the street , not the cover of vogue .
the hell with it .
i never asked her to help me .
give her my dough .
i'll be fine .
are we there yet?
you gonna ask every 5 minutes?
you said 2 hours .
is your airport on the run , too?
get me to an air conditioned suite in rio !
i want to freeze to death !
answer this question .
yeah?
why was kumare so interested in that pouch?
who cares?
i'm in rio , in a cool room ...
kumare stole wanu's soul .
now i'm sure .
kumare's a man of today .
he's into aircraft , not witchcraft .
ran his spread with a computer , but he used witchcraft to kill his neighbor's cows .
get down !
why didn't he shoot?
he's having fun .
come on !
you ok?
no ...
i never buried a priest's head before .
he'll never give up .
no .
in paris two thugs were after me .
here it's headhunters !
i made a lousy deal !
come with me .
where?
to unload the boat .
we'll take the forest route .
careful where you step .
what are you doing?
let's go .
hang in there .
we're close to the village now .
what village?
wanu's .
we'll be there before dark .
we're not going to the airport?
the village is on the way .
liar .
it's only a slight detour .
bastard !
we'll be safer there .
wanu's men are friendly , they hate kumare .
i won't go .
i won't be pushed around !
the airport , or i stay here !
what's he saying?
he won't go to the village .
she asks you to come .
she says only you can kill kumare .
crap !
you taking me to the airport?
she begs you not to desert her .
she believes in you !
she knows you'll beat him .
she's wrong !
like your pal in paris !
i'm not who she thinks .
let's go !
she was wrong to help you .
you're worthless .
i don't care what you two think of me !
here's my rifle , a machete , some water and matches .
light a fire at night because of the jaguars .
don't kill birds .
their brains are nutritious .
you kidding?
not at all .
you lied in the hospital .
a trip to the amazon ...
could be fun ...
i'm tempted !
now you dump me .
good luck , perrin !
watch out for snakes , spiders and scorpions .
let's go !
wait for me , assholes !
shit !
move !
gotta get there before dark .
we've lost enough time .
take me to the airport or i'll kill you !
do what i say or i'll shoot !
snake !
gimme the gun .
easy , no sudden moves .
it's not poisonous .
let's go !
coming?
i was screwed from the start .
when i got into that elevator in paris .
a second later ...
but i stepped in , and here i am .
now what?
we're still in that elevator .
don't get off .
you could save yourself if you stick it out .
sticking it out means what?
we'll soon know .
c'mon , we can reach the village before dark .
we're here .
you can rest .
no one here?
sure it's the right village?
what'd she say?
that she's scared .
me , too .
i hate this place .
shut up !
i hate it !
you said his men were friendly .
where are they?
don't be scared , they're our friends .
you sure?
he says we killed wanu and took him away .
he thinks you stole the pouch from wanu .
he gave it to me .
alright .
he wants the pouch .
what's with the pig?
one of your gifts from the village .
there's more to come .
what's going on?
you spoke to them in indian .
you said , " i am wanu's emissary , i will help you .
was i in a trance again?
yes .
damn !
they're counting on you .
they are?
to get rid of kumare .
you joking?
no .
they now think kumare stole wanu's soul .
i told them you'll get it back .
get rid of the goddam pig !
kumare stole wanu's soul to grab his land .
it's rich , and he's wanted it for ages .
my head aches .
it's that pig , and your fairy tale ...
it's no fairy tale .
if kumare wins , wanu dies , the forest's doomed .
the chief gives you his hut .
it's the biggest .
why?
i don't want his hut !
what do i do with this?
take it or he'll be offended .
what must i do?
fight that monster?
she says you'll kill him .
she knew it when she met you .
tell her to cool it .
you'll kill him and she'll bear your child .
he's come for the ritual painting .
i need air .
i won't fight kumare !
i'm not their champ !
want to keep your head?
what?
yours will soon be stuck on a spear !
you knew in paris it would come to this?
no , i've never steered anyone into a trap .
find a way to get me out of this .
i'll think about it .
get some rest , tomorrow may be rough .
get rid of this old goat !
see you tomorrow .
get out , too .
i want to be alone .
go on , scram !
no puppy eyes !
this isn't the spca !
now what's going on?
we have company .
a messenger from kumare .
shit !
he's a specialist in black magic .
he stole wanu's soul for kumare .
why's he here?
to plan your duel with kumare .
i said i won't fight !
then they'll cut our throats .
so what's next?
i put on my shoes .
he says kumare doesn't fear you .
you die at sundown .
say something , or he'll think you're scared .
i want to puke .
i told him you say kumare is scum .
you're nuts !
don't provoke him !
he blew in your face , that's contempt .
retaliate !
i'm sick of your dumb rituals !
i'm hot , scared and fed up !
spit in his face .
do what?
if you don't , you'll lose face .
spit in his face !
you crazy?
dozens of blowpipes are aimed at you .
do what i say , dammit !
well?
well !
no saliva !
try !
you meet kumare at noon in the big hut .
what do i do with that?
same as him .
it's a pledge .
i'm gonna faint .
no you're not .
yes , i am .
perrin , do it !
go on !
just do it !
you won't feel a thing !
perrin , go on !
beat it !
they'll take you to san pedro mission .
it's a few hours from here .
you can catch a plane there .
ok , perrin .
good luck .
so despise me , all of you !
i don't care !
i'm sane !
this is wanu's mess !
ok , so long .
why didn't he help me?
why no trance?
i stood there with that knife ...
maybe he's dead .
if he's dead , why fight?
for whom?
for them .
leave with me , forget this .
i can't .
why not?
i promised .
damn your promise to this bunch !
kumare's their problem .
don't be dumb , come with me .
good luck , perrin .
the boy scout of the amazon , ready to die !
look at him !
campana !
sorry .
i didn't belong on this trip .
i'm out of my depth .
sorry about her , too .
i was despicable .
her pity got on my nerves .
i meant no harm , she's a poor kid ...
no , she's magnificent !
i'm the creep !
my rolex , worth five grand .
it's all i have .
give it to her .
in case she has money problems ...
and give her my dough , ok?
tell her ...
maya ... you ok?
campana !
you're hurt .
i'll take you to the mission .
thirsty ...
when did we leave?
half an hour ago .
you've been out .
you've lost blood .
we'll take you to civilization .
you crazy?
you can't fight with a busted shoulder !
hold it !
stop !
i have to do it .
he tried to kill her !
one arm's enough !
stay with him ...
be happy , maya .
god bless you , campana .
you can barely stand !
it's mad !
go .
don't feel bad , you did more than your share .
take care of her , that's all i ask .
this time he's a goner .
can someone else take over?
where's he going?
where are you going?
there they are !
thank you , mr perrin .
you were great .
he's glad to be back .
your country's too cold .
his is stifling , that's no better .
what a dump !
perrin never left the amazon .
he lives with maya in wanu's village and now fiercely defends the indians and the rainforest .
if you run into him , he'll tell you that the crillon hotel elevator took him higher a lot higher , than he ever dreamed .
and that searching for an old indian's soul ... he found his own .
