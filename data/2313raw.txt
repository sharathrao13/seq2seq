25 . 000
let me warn you .
i'm mr. butterfield .
this is my line and my passengers .
you bother them , i'll hound you to kingdom come .
we won't bother anybody .
we just want what's underneath that tarpaulin .
i think our cattle are over the ridge .
i can hear them .
how'd they get over here?
come on , pop .
let's go for them .
let's let the dust settle first , son .
ben .
tell him to stay there .
stay where you are !
what do you want?
i want my cattle back !
he'll get them in 5 minutes .
you'll get them in 5 minutes !
you gonna let them do this to you?
not much else i can do .
don't anybody move !
if you move , i'll kill him .
lift him up easy .
put him on his horse .
aren't you gonna do something?
what , and get myself shot too?
that must be ben wade and his gang .
what's his name?
bill moons .
where does he live?
he used to live in contention city .
take him there .
can't .
my passengers are due in bisbee , only a few miles away .
take him to bisbee and put him on the next coach back .
where a man lives is where he should be buried .
we'll need those horses .
why?
so you don't ride to the marshal .
get off .
all right , boys .
get off .
we'll turn them loose this side of bisbee .
you wait !
my pa will kill you !
mark .
let's get the cattle .
hello there !
could you help us?
i gotta get the cattle home !
could you lend us a horse?
yeah , i'll bring one back !
what happened?
where are your horses?
the coach was held up .
they saw us , ma , and took them .
and killed the driver !
they killed the driver?
one of their fellows was on top , taking off these bags ... ... and the driver grabs him as a shield .
do they care?
no , they shoot through him .
it was ben wade .
ben wade?
what did you do?
there were 12 .
what could i do?
we stood still .
then they took our horses .
we just watched .
what else could we do?
you want us to get shot?
boys !
go saddle a couple of horses .
i ought to take them some water too , i guess .
i'm glad you're safe .
anything could have happened .
there was no danger , not to us anyway .
it just seems so terrible .
why?
what's terrible?
nothing .
what's the matter?
nothing .
it's terrible that bad things happen , and all we do is stand by and watch .
lots of things happen where you can only stand by and watch .
i know , but to have you stand by and to have the boys watching ...
that's life .
you have to watch a lot of terrible things .
people get killed .
lightning can kill you .
three years of drought killing my cattle is terrible .
but i can't make it rain .
expect me to cool off the sun?
dan , why are you so cross?
you expect something from me that i'm not .
no , i don't .
not really .
i can't go chasing after outlaws , my cattle dying all over .
lf they die , don't know what i'll do .
i'll hold it .
ten years of sweating .
you think i want to lose this place?
cattle's not dying at parker's ranch .
no , of course not .
he's got a stream that don't run dry .
have you asked him to let you use it?
what good?
six months 'water right costs $200 .
where will i get that?
oh , dan , you have to do something .
you can't just stand by and watch .
you work so hard , i work so hard and the boys ...
maybe it'll rain .
what if you borrowed the money in town?
you know i hate to beg from people .
borrowing isn't begging .
it could save us .
i suppose i could try .
you gonna look for the horses?
i'm going to bisbee first .
i'll look on the way back .
that loan would take care of six months .
by then it's bound to rain .
all this will be green in six months .
the cattle will be fat , and the boys .
maybe you and me won't be so tired all the time .
in six months we'll be happy , won't we?
sure , we'll be happy .
to the boss .
he had to say goodbye to one of us and that's too bad .
but if it wasn't goodbye for him , it could've been for some of us .
boss?
is the marshal around?
in the office .
you tell him the coach from contention was held up .
we passed it on the way in .
they don't have horses .
did you hear what i said?
yeah , i heard .
why don't you go tell him?
he naps between 1 and 2 .
he does?
that's nice .
that way he don't get tired .
you fellows come from the north?
down here everybody naps between 1 and 2 .
everybody except you .
the boss is napping now .
i take mine between 2 and 3 .
i guess we've come too early .
does this place keep your boss busy?
no , he does other things .
like what?
he has a bank and loans money to ranchers .
does he keep the money here?
he doesn't have money .
with the drought , nobody pays back .
that's too bad .
miss , if my outfit's asking too many questions , you just say so .
we've been driving cattle , and when you come to a place like this ... ... and you see a nice girl like you ...
well , it's nice .
how far's the mexican border?
nobody knows exactly .
it's never been decided .
i think we can find it all right .
when the marshal wakes up , tell him the coach was robbed .
and tell him the driver was killed .
killed?
killed .
if there's killing , i'm to wake him .
it's only robbery he don't want to be waked for .
marshal !
the coach was robbed and bill moons killed .
marshal , these fellows outside seen it !
how far back was it?
about 10 miles .
they took the horses too .
did you hear that , marshal?
why didn't you try and help?
we were strung out .
we didn't see it till we looked back .
right .
go get everybody .
where are you fellows from?
prairie cattle company .
didn't know they got this far .
they bought 60, 000 in mexico .
they sent us to drive them in .
you won't be staying?
no , just long enough to have a drink .
alex potter !
i told you he had rheumatism !
anyway , he sold his horse .
he can use one of my horses !
suspicious old goat .
where's alex potter?
sleeping it off .
i don't think he wants to leave town with us here .
scatter across the border .
we'll meet in nogales tonight .
what's holding up the boss?
don't worry , he'll be along .
he can handle that hick posse single handed .
come on .
didn't i see you some place?
did you?
yeah , did you ever ...?
did you ever work in cheyenne?
el paso?
no .
did you ever work in the blind irishman in dodge city?
yeah , i sang there .
best time i ever had in my life .
what made you quit?
i got to coughing too much .
doctor said i should breathe dry air .
you sure come to the right place here .
i spent more money in that place ...
did you remember a girl , her name was ... ... pauline?
a heavyset girl .
and velvet?
remember her?
i spent 300 in one night on her .
remember , they had real paris dresses there .
real paris perfume .
you have to treat a woman right .
i'd have spent every cent on her except she married the governor .
many young fellows around this place?
no , they're all older .
you must get ionely .
hey !
where are they?
where'd they go?
alex !
that way .
ain't you gonna help catch him?
wish i could .
how'd they look?
it'll be easy .
three big men on three white horses .
three white fellas on three big horses , huh?
ever sing anymore?
who's there to sing for?
you know , you look kind of skinny .
i feel skinny .
i don't mind a skinny girl .
just so she has blue eyes to make up for it .
you got blue eyes?
brown .
it's all right .
they don't have to be blue .
must be they buried their man here .
if i had my way , there'd be more than one .
hello , you the marshal?
you see the butterfield coach?
this is mr. butterfield .
they got a gold shipment .
see where they went?
bisbee .
we just come from bisbee .
didn't you see an outfit?
must have been 12 , all on dark horses .
you didn't see them?
yeah , we seen them .
then they left .
cy , you'd better go along , hitch up the coach down there .
we think it was ben wade .
what do you know?
there i was , face to face with ben wade .
hi , marshal .
did you catch them yet?
them were the fellas back in bisbee .
yeah?
one of them is still there .
he went into the saloon .
you been drinking this morning or not?
i never touch a drop until noon .
there's a man there .
let's catch him .
what if it's ben wade?
what good is catching him?
we'll arrest him .
till his outfit comes back and shoots up the town?
no one's held him yet .
we'll get him out of town .
we won't catch him standing here .
let's go .
are you coming , dan?
yeah , i'm coming .
what will happen is somebody will get hurt bad .
think you'll ever get back to bisbee?
don't look like it .
that's what i figured .
i never stay long anyplace .
do you care?
sure , i care .
what can i do?
you're on the go , and i'm stuck .
i ain't complaining .
i got something to remember .
me too .
funny , some men you can see every day for 10 years ... ... and you never notice .
some men you see once and they're with you the rest of your life .
what happened?
finishing my drink .
there's a fella coming down the road .
hello , mr. evans .
you want something , mr. evans?
something i can do to help you?
you drove off my cattle .
you got them back .
yes , it took me a half day .
what's half a day worth?
when i hire out a full day , i get two dollars .
here's two dollars for half a day .
then that's what i'll settle for .
there's two more for you .
what for?
for your boys .
i used their time too .
if you don't mind , you owe me two more for tiring out my cattle .
two more for tired cattle .
is there anything else you wanna get paid for?
you can give me two dollars extra for making me nervous .
don't move .
it's the marshal .
he's got a shotgun on you , wade .
put your hands up .
ben?
watch him .
i'll watch him .
now what good is all that?
he'll come back with the others ... ... and i'll go free .
and you'll get shot .
we'll get you out of town so fast you won't touch ground .
over here .
sit down , there .
here , take this .
i helped out this far .
i'm finished .
you're what?
finished .
i come here on business .
i got to take care of my cattle .
you're our best shot .
that's not my job .
i'm no deputy .
you are now .
every man is a deputy .
i was coming to see mac .
i don't mind helping , but that's all .
i can't spare time .
i'll lose everything .
that won't make any difference .
mac , you watch him .
can i talk to you a minute , mac?
what's it about , dan?
well , it's a business thing , you know .
sit down .
thanks .
the faster we get him out , the safer .
that's right .
we'll outsmart them every step .
we only got two , three hours head start .
they'll think we'll turn him in at fort huachuca .
sure , they will .
or they'll think we'll go to benson .
that's a fact .
10 to yuma .
sure , they're bound to .
alex , will you let me finish?
then you can agree .
sure .
when the coach comes , we'll put him on it and start .
start where?
that's where we fool them .
look ... ... here's benson .
here's contention .
and here's fort huachuca .
it'd only be for six months .
it'll rain by then .
rain?
sure , everybody would prosper .
i only need 200 .
lf you were my own brother ... ... i still couldn't help you .
i guess i'd better be getting back home .
how's the missus?
she's fine , thanks .
good .
how're the boys?
fine .
they're fine .
i need two volunteers .
do i have two volunteers?
for what?
i'm not telling you for what .
two will go with dave keene .
we'll follow with the prisoner .
who'll volunteer?
we gotta know what to expect .
sure , might not be safe .
safe .
who knows what's safe?
a man died from looking at his wife .
my grandma fought the indians for 60 years , then choked to death on pie .
do i have two volunteers?
i'll pay $200 to each man .
i'll volunteer .
you said you couldn't ...
do you want me or don't you?
sure , we do .
here , take this shotgun .
now , do i have another?
i'll go .
wait a minute , alex .
no offense ... ... i just think it'd be safer if we had somebody else .
come on , give me a chance .
anybody else?
alex potter and dan evans .
where are we going?
here's the plan .
we're gonna transfer him at your house .
my house?
it'll only take a minute .
everybody , out .
we need the coach .
you'll have to stay here tonight .
get another team , a four up .
get bill moons out .
there's a coach to contention tonight , i'll send him over in that .
lively , now .
lively , everybody .
get up !
come on .
you mean to say i have this all to myself?
well , that's very thoughtful of you .
bye , emmy .
goodbye .
tell you what , i'll send you something .
would you like pearls?
i'll send you some .
then maybe you won't forget .
i won't forget .
i seen 'em .
you know what to do .
we're coming to it .
i'll try .
all right , let's get him down .
all right .
hello , can you give us a hand?
get ready , come on .
heave !
all right , get out !
heave !
it worked .
those two will round up the rest and chase the coach .
there .
supper's ready .
take this out to mr. potter .
you're welcome to share what we have .
here's your stew , mr. potter .
thanks , matthew .
you know where your pa keeps a drink?
no , i don't .
don't you know where he keeps a jug?
no .
you don't mind my asking , do you?
no , pa said you would .
we always wait for mother to start .
and we don't teach others manners .
you didn't say grace .
she always says grace .
she comes from san francisco .
mark .
her father was a sea captain .
he owned a ship .
two ships .
eat your supper .
lf he was here , he'd shoot you dead .
dead as a skunk .
that's enough .
lf he wants , my pa can shoot you too .
he can shoot anything .
he can shoot a cougar a mile away .
go ahead now and eat your supper .
it's good stew , ma'am .
thank you .
you didn't say grace because he's bad?
i simply forgot .
can't you say grace with bad people?
grace is for everybody , dear .
then why don't you say it?
dear lord , we thank thee for life and for food .
we ask thee to give us the wisdom that comes with silence .
amen .
i didn't close my eyes once .
i just squinted , because you could run away .
why would i want to run away?
this is real nice .
would you like me to cut your meat?
yeah , would you , please?
thank you .
would you mind cutting the fat off?
i don't like fat .
what was it?
me .
i thought i saw something moving there .
they could've heard that .
guess i got spooky .
i was in san francisco once .
i knew a girl there .
she was a sea captain's daughter too .
and she had the greenest eyes .
i used to look deep into her eyes and they'd just change colours ... ... get all fiery and green .
all the colours of the sea .
funny how a woman's eyes will change colour at nighttime .
alice .
you go inside , alex , and don't take your eyes off him .
what was alex shooting at?
why did you have to sit there listening to him?
what do you mean?
all big eyed and listening to him .
something's moving down there .
they don't know he's here , do they?
no , they think he's in the coach .
that's how we planned it .
matthew , mark .
yes?
get the horses .
which ones?
they're saddled .
what happens when they catch the coach?
they'll have to round their men up , so they won't catch up to it till noon .
they'll find out .
by then we'll be in contention , and they can't get there in time anyway .
alex , turn down the lamp , and when the horses come , bring him out .
don't worry .
this is safer than being with the coach .
the boys are so proud .
what?
proud of you .
their own father capturing ben wade .
didn't you see them looking at you?
no , all i saw was wade .
and i'm proud too .
put him on the middle horse .
alex , you lead .
i'm obliged for your hospitality .
i appreciate it , and your husband too .
i hope i can send him back to you all right .
what did he mean , he'll send him back all right?
he was just talking .
do you think anything will happen?
sure .
he'll come back with $200 . $200 is a lot .
not if he doesn't come back , it isn't .
what's wrong?
can i see my wife from here?
no , you couldn't possibly .
maybe that's why i feel so good .
you mind telling me where we're going?
we're going to contention city .
we'll wait there .
10 comes in , we'll put you on it .
thanks .
now , if we get separated , i'll know where to wait for you .
walk your horses .
we don't want to wake up the town .
is that the house?
it was , but the man's afraid .
afraid of what?
the only thing i could arrange was a room at the hotel .
well , at least we got this far .
i'll go on across for a look .
we'll meet at the rear of the hotel .
step down easy , wade .
we're ready for you , the bridal suite .
anyone in the lobby?
one guy sleeping it off .
make sure no one knows we're here .
alex , keep a watch at the town's edge .
what could happen?
why don't you relax?
i'm practically on the train .
is that the drunk?
yeah .
it's the front room upstairs .
the key's in the door .
cover downstairs .
alex'll come if he sees anything .
you give me great confidence .
10 yet .
sit down on the bed if you want .
you must be ... ... very tired by now .
why don't you sit and have a little sleep?
i'll hold the shotgun for you if you like .
no?
i don't have anything against you personally .
i'm doing it for the money .
i know .
if you start across ... ... this eight feet between us ... ... i'll pull both triggers at once .
this is the bridal suite?
i wonder how many brides ...
is it a little hot in here?
you notice it?
kind of warm .
you mind if i open that window?
think you can reach it from where you are?
it's too far .
i'll open it .
want me to give you a hand?
sit back .
go ahead .
you don't take any chances , do you?
where's your sporting blood?
back home with my wife and boys .
they usually leave a stick around .
you can prop it open .
they usually stand it in a corner somewhere .
see it?
right over there .
right there .
feel better now?
i had to try you out .
i didn't think you'd shoot .
you know i will the next time .
do i?
see anything?
not for miles .
quiet here?
like a tomb .
did you come in for a drink?
first time i can remember , i don't want one .
scared?
which room is he in?
second floor in front .
don't think i'm too scared of wade's gang to do what's necessary .
tell dan he can count on alex potter right to the end .
i'm gonna ride on back and keep watch .
how long has he been there?
i only know , when he come in ... ... he asked me if i'd seen a big woman in a purple hat .
sure is some sleeper .
he sure is .
how much money do you make?
not very much .
you figure that's your business?
yes , i do .
how do you figure?
you must need money bad to do this .
maybe i do .
how much they paying you? $200 . $200?
that's a lot of money .
how'd you like to double that and save yourself time and trouble?
how do you reckon i'll do that?
drop that gun and let me walk out .
it's worth $400 to me .
kind of reckless of you .
especially since you're sure your men are coming for you .
oh , they are .
yes , they're coming .
only , i like to do things real easy .
real peaceful .
you want to look out at a peaceful scene?
you might recognize somebody .
that's mrs. moons in front .
the young man ... ... that's his son , bob .
she had another son .
he was the stagecoach driver , bill moons .
he used to drive the coach .
remember him?
yes , seems to me i do .
a hotheaded fellow , wasn't he?
not reasonable , like you .
i sure am , friend .
i'm so reasonable i'll let you walk right out of here .
10 , and i'll be behind you with a shotgun .
i can tell you're a very intelligent man ... ... and i wouldn't want to try to corrupt your morals .
mighty nice of you .
know something?
i think i know what's bothering you .
i wouldn't dream of suggesting ... ... you let a murderer walk out free .
but you see , bill moons drew first .
that makes it self defence , doesn't it?
i don't go around just shooting people down .
that isn't nice .
i work quiet ... ... like you .
all right , so you're quiet like me .
well , then shut up like me .
hey , is that the right time?
yes , sir .
why didn't you wake me?
you didn't ask me to .
anybody come in lately?
you mean , to engage a room?
yeah , any strangers come in town?
not since you went to sleep .
might as well go .
she won't come .
who were you planning to meet?
my wife .
she ran off with a travelling man .
i figured he'd bring her here .
what do you know?
mine ran off too .
i wonder why they do that .
i don't know .
i always treated mine all right , never hit her too hard .
i'm gonna go outside and wait .
if she don't come soon , i'm gonna go .
sure would like to get my hands on her .
thank you .
three years 'drought ain't bad .
at one time they had 10 years of drought right around here .
a big outfit , they got nothing to worry about with drought .
they got all the water they need .
with a little money , you can get almost anything .
maybe so .
cowpokes like us just don't belong in that kind of a business .
trying to make a go .
killing ourselves .
trying to make a go of it alone .
got to have money behind you .
ever think of taking on a partner?
i work alone .
a silent partner , with money .
say ... ... $7000 .
you think that's my price?
just think ... ... with $7000 you can do everything you've ever dreamed of .
think it over .
nobody needs to know .
maybe you come higher?
maybe .
all right .
when you decide , let me know .
i'll let you know .
what'll it be?
anybody want whiskey?
everything go all right?
all right .
you couldn't wait for the preacher .
george prayed .
prayed real good too .
sorry more people weren't there to hear it .
things come to a pass when the boss can't go to a man's funeral .
really , i can explain .
especially when the labourer was protecting the employer .
god rest his soul .
as for your soul ... ... you'll have neither cooler nor hotter place than this .
if i can do anything to help you decide , let me know .
how can i trust you?
about the $7000?
yeah , how do i know i'll get it?
because it'll be 10 .
10?
see , that makes it easier for me .
i count by 10s .
do me a favour , will you?
don't talk to me for a while .
sure .
of course , you know ... ... it would be easier if we could get it settled .
you shut up .
now you just sit there and shut up .
you mean , we're not together?
we're not even close .
at about five minutes to 3 ... ... we'll be a lot closer than you think .
who is it?
butterfield .
what do you want?
i've got coffee for you .
leave that shotgun where it is !
he found out and pulled a gun .
he's been drinking .
10?
i'll save everybody a long ride .
that fair , wade?
shoot and you'll hang for murder .
stay or i'll shoot you .
hand me that gun .
get out of the way !
hand me that gun or i'll push you through that wall .
you're pretty good .
what if somebody heard that shot?
don't you go blaming yourself because it isn't your fault .
you'd have seen the same thing in benson ... ... or huachuca .
no matter where you take me ... ... somebody would be riding for help right now .
when one of us is caught , we figure the places where they'd take us .
then we send one man to each of those places ... ... to wait .
and watch .
i wouldn't worry too much , though .
he might not be back in time .
he won't .
he can't possibly .
what'll we do?
we can't just wait .
if i were you , i'd get some help .
just in case .
moons , are you going to run?
or will you help dan put me on the train?
butterfield isn't .
i am .
i give you my word .
i'll walk with you every step of the way .
we'll see .
we'll see .
i seen a fellow riding out .
we know .
get back out and keep watching !
get the sheriff .
tell him to get as many deputies as he can .
sheriff's out of town .
what do you mean?
he took a prisoner to tucson .
we'll do it without him .
mr. moons , are you with us?
if it's a fair fight , sure .
i'd stay for that .
fair fight , that's a man's duty .
but this way ...
this is a big outfit , wade's gang .
tough .
another time , but my mother ...
one son buried ...
go on .
go on , get out .
i'm sure i can get help .
even five .
five men would give us a chance .
five would be easy .
certainly in a town this size you can get five .
the street seems to be clearing .
everybody going inside .
i guess they figure a storm is blowing up .
any news?
not a word .
think they'll find out where alex and dan took wade?
i don't know , but i won't take the chance .
maybe there's still time .
i like a girl singing .
you like a girl singing?
i don't know , it kind of keeps a man from working too hard .
puts his mind at rest .
of course , she doesn't have to be singing .
dan , what time does the watch say?
almost 2 : 30?
that leaves you one half hour to decide .
i figure when they get here , they won't come right up .
and if they try to , they'll find you dead .
yeah .
that's why they'll wait until we leave for the station .
no , i think i'll just take a little rest .
we got help .
we got five down in the lobby .
that makes eight .
keep them in the lobby .
don't let anyone start anything .
if they don't try to get in , we don't start it .
it's almost 2 : 30 , dan .
all right !
what time did he say it was?
2 : 30 .
when i was having supper with you last night ... ... i was just sitting there , and i was thinking ...
maybe someday i'd like to have a wife .
yeah , must be real nice ... ... having a couple of boys like that to ride out with every morning .
and then a woman like that ... ... every night .
real close .
that must be nice .
i'll tell you , i'd treat her better than you do .
i'd feed her better , get her pretty dresses she'd be happy wearing .
and i wouldn't make her work so hard .
yeah , i bet she was ... ... a real beautiful girl before she met you .
i told you to shut up !
one more word and i'll cut you down !
you won't .
i'd say you tried to get away .
you hear me?
i hear you .
do you believe me?
maybe i do .
go look out the window .
see if they've come yet .
go ahead .
everything's real quiet out there , isn't it?
everybody getting off the streets .
i guess they wanna get in out of the heat .
dan .
they're coming .
butterfield's got some men downstairs .
go help him .
i just seen them coming .
how many are there?
i didn't count .
all right , men .
ben , are you all right?
what shall i tell them?
what do you mean?
when shall i say you're gonna let me go?
tell them you'll write them a letter from yuma .
charlie , go buy the boys a drink .
we'll come soon .
are you all right?
yes .
he could shoot you and say you tried to run .
kill him?
they'll kill us first .
ben , tell him what'll happen if we hear a gun .
he knows .
he knows .
your turn , general .
what do you expect me to say?
something that makes sense .
something that makes sense for your wife and children too .
you've got a real twisted mind , haven't you?
take a look , dan .
don't you wanna see them?
i'll see them soon enough .
all right .
break it up .
hey , dan .
dan , don't make it hard on yourself .
all you gotta do is drop the gun and let me walk out the door .
listen .
why are you squeezing the watch?
you sure no one would know?
squeezing that watch won't stop time .
you shouldn't get so scared .
you might make a bad move .
he said there were only a few .
i counted seven .
i didn't figure on a shootout .
come on .
just a minute , fellas .
please .
can't you see we need you?
there's one of your outfit , dan .
what time is it now?
what time do you figure it is , dan?
about 2 : 40?
that's one of your outfit walking out on you .
they'll all walk out on you .
why shouldn't they?
i'll pay you each $50 .
don't you have a duty?
you wanna see us shot?
please .
i'm asking you .
please , i'm begging you .
nobody wants to walk out on you .
this happened in bisbee .
why bring your troubles here?
we've got families .
every man here is a family man .
dan's a family man too .
i'm a family man , in a way .
let's get out of here .
you see , dan , everybody wants to live .
butterfield too .
he'll walk out .
no , he won't .
he'll stick .
he's human .
at five minutes to 3 , butterfield will walk out ... ... and leave you all alone .
now what do you figure you're gonna die for?
because butterfield lost his gold shipment?
because a fool got what he deserved?
i'm going up to talk to dan .
you watch out from here .
drop the gun .
dan , the roof !
take good care of him .
dan , open up .
what happened to alex?
i heard shots .
i ran .
they were dragging him to the hotel .
dan !
guess that leaves just the two of you .
if there's one more shot , i shoot you .
tell them .
hey , charlie .
you've got one more shot .
make it good .
we'll use it going to the station .
go see what they did to alex .
listen to me , dan .
i'm not going through with it .
and you aren't either .
what happened to alex?
dan ...
what happened?
dan , if you think you have ... ... any obligation , you don't .
i'm releasing you .
alex is dead .
the odds are changing , aren't they?
now it's one against seven .
you have no obligation .
you'd better listen to what he said .
you'd better ...
you're real lucky , dan .
a woman like that to come home to .
alex .
dan?
where are you?
here .
if he moves an inch , give him both barrels .
dan , where are you?
alice .
did you hear that thunder?
lf you're doing this for me ...
if it rains ...
if it's something i said ...
everything would be green .
dan , please don't be stubborn .
i heard thunder .
dan , there's no thunder .
there won't be rain either .
if i ever said anything that made you think ... ... i was complaining ... ... it just isn't true because i love everything .
every minute .
all the worry , all the work , all the hurts of life .
if it's the $200 you need , i'll still pay .
don't go through with it .
i've got to .
for the money?
no .
for me?
no .
then why?
i've got to , that's all .
i don't want a hero .
i want you .
if i didn't have to do it , i wouldn't .
but i heard alex scream .
he gave his life because he believed ... ... people should be able to live in peace together .
you think i can do less?
don't .
no , please don't go through with it .
you know i've never been able to give you very much .
no pearls , nothing .
sometimes not enough food for the family .
maybe this'll be something worth remembering .
what are you saying?
don't you think you'll make it?
of course .
at 3 : 00 , i'll walk to the station .
then why are you talking about a memory?
i mean , the boys'll always remember ... ... i walked ben wade to the station .
you go downstairs .
i'll be down in a minute .
it's time , wade .
butterfield , i'm gonna take him out the back way .
stay with alice .
as soon as we get near those cattle pens ... ... take alice and drive her out of town as fast as you can .
all right , then .
alice , i don't want you to worry .
i'll get him to yuma .
then i'll be right back .
i'll be waiting .
one more shot and i'll cut you in two .
i told you , you have just one more shot .
next time , make it good .
there they go !
you'll have trouble making that next corner .
that's thoughtful of you , friend .
go first and you'll get it from ahead .
go last and you'll get it from back here .
worked all right , didn't it?
it worked real good .
wait .
one of my men up there on the roof .
why don't you wave to him?
well , right on time .
i won't have to wait .
there's still time to get out of this .
there's still time .
cross the street .
here we go .
now .
they're headed for the train !
why the stop?
to do you a favour .
run before they chop you down .
move .
all right .
that's not so far .
we should make that real easy .
tell them to come out .
you tell them .
too bad , dan .
you made a nice try .
we'll be on that baggage car .
stay where you are !
drop , ben !
drop , ben !
drop !
go down , ben !
i'll kill him !
let's go .
how do i know you'll jump?
you'll have to trust me .
jump !
why'd you do it , ben?
i don't like owing any favours .
you saved my life at the hotel .
besides , i've broken out of yuma before .
well , my job's over when i get you there .
