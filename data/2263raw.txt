i don't care what they say .
you guys were heroes out there .
that was some cocky shit out there .
you know how to play this , right?
that woman is alive because of what we did .
yeah , alive and suing the city for millions .
chief says if he pays , somebody else does too ... ... and it sure isn't gonna be me .
fuller , we get two seconds to make ...
capt. fuller !
capt. fuller , we get two seconds to make a decision .
you get two months to sit there and tear it apart .
swat means " special weapons and tactics .
where were your tactics out there?
saving a woman from getting shot .
that's where they were .
every cop knows we did the right thing .
sometimes doing the right thing isn't doing the right thing .
what the hell does that mean?
sergeant .
you disobeyed a direct order .
end of story .
you're both off swat .
they're two of our best officers .
i'm not sticking them in the field after a stunt like that .
sorry , i didn't know that saving lives was a stunt .
you got a big mouth , and you're quick on the trigger ... ... and that is why your ass is in a sling .
if you're gonna put them off swat , at least keep them in the division .
give them a shot at getting back .
stick them in the gun cage .
get them out of my sight .
gun cage?
this is total bullshit .
what?
i said , this is bullshit .
really?
yeah .
you should consider yourself lucky lt. velasquez is standing up for you .
i'm lucky i don't work for an asshole like you .
that's it !
you're out of here , gamble !
you're gone !
control yourself !
get out of here !
what the hell's the matter with you?
street !
you stay .
hey !
give us a minute .
please , sit down .
i'll stand .
look , jim ... ... we both know that gamble is a bad influence on the rest of the team .
gamble's a good cop .
unlike him , you still have a chance at a future here .
you go on record that gamble acted recklessly ... ... and you had to follow your partner in after he disobeyed orders ... ... and i will make sure that you are back on swat tomorrow morning .
let's get the hell out of here .
i need a cocktail .
i'm staying .
you're what?
what ...?
after that?
couple months ... ... fuller will find new asses to chew out .
we'll be back on the team .
fuller is the cockroach of this department , brother .
he's not gonna give us a second chance .
what are you gonna do?
piss away all the hard work you did to get here?
piss what away , jimmy?
the cage?
come on , man .
we're better than that , and you know it .
you gonna come with me?
a real partner wouldn't have to ask that , would he?
a real partner would step up to what he did in the bank .
yeah .
i saved the hostage .
you disobeyed the hold .
no , i saved that hostage !
you disobeyed the hold !
you made the decision yourself .
and you shot a hostage .
jesus , brian !
you sound a lot like fuller .
is that what you two were talking about in there?
did you rat me out?
you cut a deal to get back on the team , jimmy?
did i cut a deal?
yeah , did you?
how many times have i covered up for one of your goddamn stunts?
that's what a partner's supposed to do .
you just picked a paycheck over me , bro .
you just picked yourself over everything else .
you want to stay here and be fuller's bitch ... ... you go right ahead .
i can't do it .
i can't do it .
damn it .
goddamn it .
goddamn it , jim !
partners for five years .
this is how you want to end it .
i didn't end it .
you sold me out to the brass .
you know , i never realized till now how full of shit you are .
fuck you and swat .
you're too attached to that soda , gus .
love that stuff .
the wife would have my behind if she busted me sucking that down .
why , is she a mr. pibb fan?
you know the deal , jim .
when we got married , i converted to mormonism .
we can't consume anything that alters our state of mind .
we treat our bodies with respect .
and i treat mine like an amusement park .
it's the differences that make this country great .
need them cleaned by the morning , boys .
you were supposed to have it in a half hour ago .
what , your boy gonna report me to the captain?
just for thinking you look good in that mustache .
your mom seems to like it , though .
so does your sister .
hey , sarge , welcome back .
look who's back .
welcome back , sarge .
what's up , hondo?
hey , sarge .
howdy .
what do you need?
sgt. hondo?
you're back .
you know what they say , gus .
you're either swat or you're not .
yes , sir .
what can i do for you?
oh , just a tune up .
but please , don't touch my sights .
and i made some modifications ...
to the trigger too .
and you are?
jim street .
street .
yeah , we'll leave them intact .
i need that back by tomorrow .
can do , sergeant .
good to see you .
good seeing you .
gosh , gus , is that a woody?
heck , yeah .
that's hondo .
he's old school swat .
the gold standard of ass kicking .
sorry , butt kicking .
i guess he's back .
i guess he is .
a weeklong series , attacking us top to bottom .
and it's all swat's fault , right?
no , the chief's been pretty fair about blaming everyone .
he does want these bad headlines to end .
he wants the old warhorses to help restore the luster .
old?
i know you ain't talking about me .
you gotta shake off that three year rust from rampart .
i'm throwing you in right away .
sooner the better .
i want you to put together a young , kick ass element for me , dan .
you select them , you train them , you mold them .
i know you're not talking about giving me five pups fresh out of the gate .
i didn't come back to wipe noses .
hell , no .
now , you worked with t. j. and boxer at southwest .
you up for supervising them here?
that's a start .
now all you have to do is find three fresh ones .
only catch is , fuller has to approve the three .
what did capt. fuller say when he heard the chief was bringing me back?
hasn't stopped swearing since .
what's your brother's truck doing outside?
we having a garage sale i don't know about?
you weren't supposed to be home for an hour .
sorry to screw up your getaway .
look , let's not make this a thing , okay?
we both knew it was coming .
it's not like we were in this to get married , right?
and you've changed since ...
well , people change .
look , when it was good it was great , right?
that means something .
yeah , thanks .
damn it !
hey !
hey !
i'm gonna throw this thing out .
do and you die .
every swat team in the world's gonna have one someday .
it's 50 pounds of scrap metal .
all right .
say you got some crazy suspect barricaded in a house .
all right .
just chain this to the back of a truck ... ... shove this end right through the wall ... ... these rods spring out like fishhooks .
your partner guns the truck , takes the whole wall with him .
and we waltz right in and surprise the bad guy , right?
correct .
i call it " the key to the city .
patent pending .
is that right?
right .
let me get your m 4 .
and ...
took the rattle out of the receiver .
yeah , new buffer , new gas rings .
cleaned the gas tube .
surprised you didn't starch the sling .
if you want me to show you how to shoot it , i'm here all week , 9 to 5 .
shooters , on the line !
stand by !
ready !
put them on safe and holster .
no roll , hondo?
how do you know i didn't?
you didn't , did you?
they only roll in john woo movies , not real life .
all right .
here's the winner .
there's a few people that i would like to thank .
my fellow swat officers , all of you , thank you for believing in me ... ... when the bosses didn't give me a chance .
that's why you're the marksman and i'm the guy who tells you who to shoot .
here you go .
i got you covered since i let you down .
tell you what ... ... i got 100 here says that guy can kick your ass .
are you kidding me , hondo?
come on .
he's our gun bunny .
oh , well , let's make it 200 then .

yeah .
don't look so worried .
yo .

hey , don't forget to take your safety off .
street .

she'll never know .
gus , you're cheating on your wife with fast food .
you're right .
you're absolutely right .
street , you have a driver's license?

that's good enough .
so get your uniform on .
you're driving me today .

it's my uncle's birthday .
i want to surprise him .
if you want me to come by and mow your lawn later ... ... i'm available , sergeant .
i'll keep that in mind .
call me hondo .
i was a marine .
did two years in nam , recon unit .
spent the next four teaching combat survival .
you serve?
yeah .
navy seals , right?
that's what my file says .
so , what did you do for them?
besides rescue marines when they got lost?
you sniper detail , amphibious assault , what?
my boat crew leader always said if anyone knew what we did ... ... we'd failed .
that's fair enough .
so where are we going , hondo?
what say we go see what the weather's like in south central?
tell us where your boyfriend is .
look , i don't speak spanish !
tell me where your boyfriend is !
you're not helping him any !

i don't give a damn .
i could've caught him myself .
if you like hard work , long hours and getting dirty for low pay ... ... i got an opening on my swat team .
shut up !
i don't mind that at all .
pack your bags .
you're coming to swat school .
swat school?
shut up !
don't talk too much !
shut up !
don't y'all got nothing better to do than be hauling a black man to jail?
just perpetuating the cycle , ain't you?
we'll see how liberal you are when he's breaking into your place .
uh huh , " my ass .
sure you don't want to sit in the back?
i could wear a little cap .
i like the view from up here .
the cap thing's a nice touch , though .
officer burress , southwest division .
well , your test scores are off the chart , and you got all the right references .
thank you , sergeant .

hot dog with everything , ginger ale .
street?
same .
well , i will have a soy dog , please ... ... on a whole wheat bun , plain ... ... and a tomato juice , if you got it .
thank you .
i'm a vegetarian .
i'm a bit curious .
you've been a cop six years and you've never had a civilian complaint?
i try to be courteous and professional with everyone i encounter .
well , the thing is , dave ...
david .
right .
david .
here's the thing .
there may come a time in swat when you gotta get a little dirty ... ... behind a street bust .
you know what i'm saying?
no .
how the hell can i trust a man ... ... won't eat a good old fashioned american hot dog?
he's a vegetarian .
i'm looking for an injured officer , name of sanchez .
i'm looking for an injured officer , name of sanchez .
chris sanchez .
room five .
in the corner .
thank you .
what do you need , sarge?
you sanchez's partner?
sanchez do that?
you help?
no , sarge .
reminds me of my third divorce .
bad day , huh?
kiss my ass , " se " .
i'm starting to like this sanchez already .
spent four years in metro , passed the swat quals three times .
been rejected by fuller three times .
might be a reason .
he's got a couple of beefs here .
i'm going to get the nurse to clean and dress your wound .
sorry .
wrong room .
who you looking for?
chris sanchez .
i'm chris sanchez .
you're chris sanchez?
look , if you're internal affairs ... ... that guy had razorblades in his mouth .
i had to put him down hard .
i'm sick and tired of these bullshit complaints because some " vato ... " ... doesn't like getting thrown to the pavement by a woman .
i look like iad to you?
who are you?
wait , now , that guy had about 100 pounds on you .
all brawn , no brains .
you didn't answer my question .
so you still want to work swat?
no , i just enjoy applying all the time .
gas it up .
return it .
am i looking at another day of chauffeur duty?
team's almost filled .
not that it hasn't been fun .
well , i do have one more spot .
can you think of anybody i might've overlooked?
this a game or a test , sergeant?
could be a bit of both .
yeah , i'm a little old for games .
all right .
so how'd you like to be back on swat?
it's not gonna happen .
so why you hanging around the cage then?
it's a job .
and swat's a calling .
anybody around you for five minutes can tell you still got the bug .
all you gotta do is say yes .
it's not up to me or you .
i got a history here .
yeah , let's talk about that .
i heard some rumors about you and your old partner .
did you give him up in fuller's office?
because , you know , team members gotta trust each other .
i'm not on your team .
and no , i didn't give him up .
you've been in that cage six months , shining boots and fixing weapons ... ... waiting for a second chance .
i got one , and i'm offering it to you .
fuller will never sign off on it .
you let me deal with that paper pushing punk .
i want you on my team .
let me tell you , it's the sauce .
if you don't have the right sauce , what do you got?
you know?
my mother , she used to make sauce .
now you go into the store , and you buy it in a jar or in a can ...
alex?
alex !
nobody told me you were coming .
when did you get here?
surprise .
happy birthday , uncle .
come on , sit down .
sit .
bring some champagne , huh?
sit , eat .
the chief's making me take you back .
he's concerned about losing all his best officers .
he thinks i'm one of his best officers?
but ... ... he's given me complete oversight .
and trust me , you got no room for error .
so i will give you boxer , t. j. mccabe and this new guy ... ... deacon kaye .
i have to pass on the other two .
sanchez is a woman , and street ...
well , street's on my shitlist .
hey , i'm on your shitlist too , and i'm the team leader .
you work for me now , and it's my team to choose .
with all due respect , captain , other leaders get to pick their teams .
and you can too .
just pick two new people .
look ... ... just give me the team i ask for .
you can even call it your shitlist team .
that way , if anything goes wrong , you can put all the blame on me .
it'd be just like old times .
okay .
okay , you got your team .
but when you fail , and you probably will fail ... ... sanchez goes back to traffic , and you and street are plain gone .
no , not just off swat , off the force .
you feel me?
oh , yeah .
i feel you .
okay , i'm leaving now .
no , don't go .
i have wine and cognac from home .
come on .
i must go .
i have a flight to catch .
oh , catch another flight .
let me introduce you to monica .
you like this knife?
this is my father's knife .
he gave it to me .
it's a beautiful knife , and she's a beautiful woman .
now , why don't you stay , have a good time and go back tomorrow .
listen , i'm running the business now .
i'm the new boss .
don't joke with me , alex .
and don't ever forget , your father's running the business .
no , i retired him .
he never spoke of that to me .
that's because he can't speak anymore .
you put your hand in my father's pocket .
not in mine .
if you take my money , i'll take your life .
understood?
mail it to me .
yeah !
smile !
good evening .
may i see your license , registration and proof of insurance?
i'm a tourist , you know .
i'm visiting the u. s.
i have my passport if you want .
let me see it .
whose car is this?
it belongs to my uncle .
why?
you got a left taillight out .
hi , this is bridget the midget .
we're out here in front of the key club on sunset in beautiful hollywood .
i just wonder how you can get inside of there .
anyways , we're on sunset boulevard , where anything could happen .
especially police harassment .
hey , you guys , you're all pigs !
is your uncle's name martin gascoigne?
yeah .
so we're okay?
there's a warrant in that name ... ... and i have to detain you until we can verify who you are .
sir , please step out of the vehicle .
you're here awful early .
traffic was lighter than usual .
streets must've been damn near empty .
ali's his sister .
and i called bottoms on the last one .
you called bottoms , but that's not what you got .
yo , dog , what's up?
what's happening?
jim .
boxer .
so , what did you do to my sister?
nothing .
that's not what i heard .
i mean , that's not the word on the street .
she's all broken up over you .
don't know why .
she left me .
dumped .
a case of crabs will do that to a woman .
is there something about this team i need to know?
i want to know what an asshole like you ... ... did to my little sister to make her leave .
she's 28 , all right?
and trust me , she's not so little .
trust you?
no , you didn't .
how's your last partner doing?
gamble .
he trust you too?
you wanna talk about this?
you gonna tell me?
been on your chest for a while , yeah?
street !
you wanna talk about it?
come here .
don't talk about what you don't ...
yo !
street !
it's not worth it .
who else you gonna narc on?
who are you?
who the hell are you?
guess you're not the prettiest one here anymore , huh , t. j.?
well , sounds like you've all gotten acquainted .
let's get started .
i'll make this simple .
l. a. p. d. swat is the most honored , most respected ... ... and most professional police division in the world .
go , go , go !
police !
police !
police !
that ain't gonna get it .
bang .
sanchez .

oh , man .

what's up , sanchez?

when you're done with that one , i got one for you .
t. j. 's sitting on two pair .
looking for the boat .
got it .
street , you got three aces .
need one to take t. j. out .
got a winner , winner !
all right , deke .
let's see what you got .
ten of spades .

not good enough .
hondo , isn't that a straight flush?
hold the phone .
six , seven ... ... eight , nine , ten of spades !
straight flush .
deke !

i think it works in orange county too .
sure you're right .
good work , guys .
police !
police !
clear .
clear .
clear .
go .
that's right .
swat is a life saving organization , not a life taking one .
that's why the fbi and secret service come here to train with us .
smooth , deke .
i guess if i was deaf , i wouldn't know you were here .
but while you're laughing , there's lots of people that want us to fail .
get it right .
clear .
clear .
clear .
suspect , put your hands on your head and come out .
come out !
come out now !
turn around .
go !
down .
get down .
yeah .
outstanding , guys .
you feel that?
the team's going out for beers later .
i'm buying .
i'll take mine after we pass .
well , fuller's definitely gonna try and hose us .
good .
i'd hate to break a sweat just for a first round knockout .
hey , we got a big day tomorrow .
save some .
i got plenty .
i'm depending on you to get these guys through this .
i'll cover my end .
can i ask you something?
yeah , go for it .
why'd you pick me?
to piss off the captain .
all right , here's the scenario .
there are six hijackers armed with handguns and knives ... ... in control of that plane .
they've killed one hostage and are threatening to kill the others ... ... unless they get a pilot and fuel within the hour .
there'll be swat officers disguised as hostages .
other swat officers will be playing the roles of terrorists .
and they will be trying to kill you .
staff sergeants will be grading us .
couldn't give us the bus , huh , hondo?
they always give us the bus .
fuller's really got it in for us .
you think?
another thing .
there are two dynamic entry points .
one here beneath the front landing gear ... ... one back here by the baggage compartment .
i'm sure fuller's got surprises at both those entrances .
we get bogged down anywhere , we fail .
any ideas?
there's another way in , hondo .
there's an elevator shaft where they bring in the service carts .
and there's a mechanic's access right here .
man , that's gonna be tight as hell .
yeah .
how many men can we fit in there?
men?
none .
all right .
work this out .
get in there and break fuller's heart .
okay .
what do we got?
toy guns .
toy guns , sir .
toy guns .
let's do this .
all right .
shame you're not playing a terrorist .
i'm supposed to be in first class .
we got camera three going up .
