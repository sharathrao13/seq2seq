my god , she nearly got her head cut off .
when i get to america ,
i will not live in brentwood .
second floor .
in the most alds infested region of the globe ... where one in four is infected ...
andre's idea of a joke was to put a young lman and a young naomi in my bed .
and no condom within 100 miles .
hello , mr. yuri .
hi .
we'd be happy to make you happy .
uh , i can't .
i'd love to .
but i can't .
don't worry .
we don't have anything .
how do you know?
do we look like it?
what if i have alds?
don't you worry?
you worry too much .
why do you worry about something that can kill you in ten years when there are so many things that can kill you today?
now ... ... how can we make you happy?
by leaving .
these are my kalashnikov kids .
my boy brigades .
i can see what you are thinking , but we need every man we can get .
even if they're not men?
a bullet from a fourteen year old ... ... is just as effective as one from a forty year old .
often more effective .
no one can stop this bath of blood .
it's not " bath of blood .
it's " bloodbath .
thank you .
but i prefer it my way .
i am not going to pay your asking price .
we are not a rich people .
and besides , the market is already flooded with your kalashnikovs .
do you realize in some parts of my country you can get one for the price of a chicken?
but you can't just consider unit price .
you forget ancillary costs .
end user certificates need to be forged and notarized ,
shell companies set up , insurance purchased , pilots and crews hired .
not to mention bribes .
you can't get a nut and bolt out of the eastern bloc without a bribe .
there's one bribe for the nut , another for the bolt .
andy ... andy , listen to me .
this is an expensive proposition .
andy "?
i am going to pay you in timber or stones .
i'll take the stones .
it's kind of hard to get a tree trunk into my hand luggage .
i know you're planning a new offensive .
if you can delay a week ,
i can get you armored personnel carriers .
they'd greatly reduce your casualties ... ... and give you a significant strategic advantage .
you know , they call me the lord of war .
but perhaps it is you .
it's not " lord of war , " it's " warlord .
thank you , but i prefer it my way .
conflict diamonds are a common currency in west africa , also referred to as " blood diamonds " since bloodshed is what they generally finance .
by the late '90s , my wealth had caught up to my lies about my welth .
even surpassed my lies .
i could even afford to become a patron of the arts .
it's just that i can't believe it .
well , of .. of course , it's wonderful .
i just ...
i didn't expect it to happen so soon .
yes .
well , that wou that would be great , too yeah .
it's wonderful .
thank you so much .
it's ...
yuri .
okay , thank you .
bye .
yuri , that was the dealer on the phone .
i just sold my first painting .
aah !
that's fantastic .
uh , who bought it?
it's someone important .
they want to remain anonymous .
this is so wonderful !
how was your trip?
you know , same old , same old .
where's nicki?
oh , in bed , i'm sorry .
he couldn't stay up .
that's best .
my first painting !
i'm officially an artist !
this calls for a drink .
what doesn't?
hi .
yuri , this is uh ...
candy .
candy .
of course .
any friend of my brother's is a ... friend of my brother's .
you have a beautiful ... everything .
yes , he does .
yes , i do .
i'm going to kiss nicki goodnight .
okay .
how are you , brother?
well , you know , still the resident family fuckup .
yeah .
well , i guess someone has to do it .
well .
hey , ava knows , right?
i never want to say anything ,
she doesn't have to know .
she understands .
she's a survivor , like me .
she may be a survivor , but she's not like you .
really she doesn't know how you pay for all this
we don't talk about it .
how many car salesman talk about their work?
huh?
how many cigarette salesmen? both their products kill more people every year than mine .
at least mine has a safety switch .
if those guys can leave their work at the office , so can l .
god damn , you are good !
you really are .
you almost had me convinced .
could you ... could you help me out with ...
why?
why?
why?
why what?
why?
why?
i don't know .
why ...
i don't know .
why what?
why're you so fucked up all the time?
because i am .
i don't know .
i didn't know how much ava really knew ... and how much she ignored .
she never questioned how a guy in the transport business ... could afford to give her 18 carat diamond earrings .
i guess she didn't want to hear the answer .
mostly , she seemed content that i was a good provider ... and as far as she was concerned , loyal .
despite the other women ...
i always made love to ava as if she was the only one .
i'm not saying i didn't have setbacks .
it's not called gunrunning for nothing . you gotta be fast on your feet .
some revolutions blow over the guns even get there .
there's nothing's more expensive for an arms dealer than peace .
truce?
what do you mean , truce?
the guns are already on their way .
peace talks .
all right , forget it .
i'll re route the shipment to the balkans .
when they talk about war , they keep their word .
of course , a new breed of gunrunner requires a new breed of cop .
henry , take park avenue .
take 'em on a tour of new jersey .
yuri , there are men going through our garbage cans .
well , it's probably just some reporters
iooking for somebody else .
i have a feeling they don't work for the tabloids .
yuri ... is there anything i should be worried about?
no , nothing . nothing?
i love you .
i love you , too .
sir .
i was now the best merchant of death alive .
i didn't own my own plane , i owned a fleet .
running guns into liberia , sierra leone , or the lvory coast at least once a week .
most trips i had phony paperwork .
the deadline was tight and i had to cut corners ,
i had no paperwork at all .
but i wasn't overly concerned .
there was hardly any radar over most of africa and even fewer people to watch it .
charlie echo lndia , ... re route to kabala airport ... ... on heading zero two nine . comply immediately .
yuri , what the fuck is going on?
hello , southern?
it's yuri .
i sorry to call you on this number .
but i've got lnterpol's all over my ass .
i can't know you right now .
it's uh , not a good time .
not a good time?
motherfucker !
charlie , echo , lndia , comply immediately .
this is your last warning .
where was the first fucking warning?
rock your wings if you intend to comply
i'm putting us down .
if you land , we're going away .
i don't have paperwork .
we're in a flying fucking bomb !
they're firing bullets at our bullets .
i'm putting us down .
okay , okay .
fuck !
this is charlie , echo , lndia .
request re route to kabala airport , bearing zero two nine .
no , not the airport .
there the highway .
it's our only hope .
are you fucking mad?
a pothole will set us off .
you underestimate yourself , alexei .
you're the best .
you're the shit , alexei , you're the shit !
you're the shit !
you're the shit !
of course alexei wasn't the best .
he'd come forty second out of forty three at the moscow flight school .
oh , god , what's he doing?
is this guy nuts?
i can't land there , sir .
kabala's fifteen minutes away .
he can't get far .
i want a truck on the tarmac .
we gonna be okay .
where are you going?
as far from the evidence as we can get .
wait , there's not going to be any evidence !
come here .
come here .
hey , don't be shy .
here , look .
free sample help yourself , okay?
free sample .
tell yourt friend .
gun for you .
happy times . come on .
help yourselves .
no charge .
everything goes .
guns , guns , guns , yes , come on up !
here !
you're having fun now , huh?
come on !
guns , guns , guns !
yes !
bullets , guns , grenades !
take 'em all .
take the whole crate .
go ahead .
gun , grenades , hooray !
bullets !
guns !
grenades !
yeah .
that one's got your name on it .
you want one , too?
come on .
don't forget the bullets .
don't forget the bullets .
how can you shoot a gun if you don't have bullets?
everything goes for free !
guns , grenades !
all you see .
bullets , guns , grenades .
hooray , hooray !
have the bullets .
what a cargo crew at heathrow airport does in a day took a bunch of malnourished sierra leonean locals ten minutes .
by the time agent valentine got there , you could find more guns on a plane full of quakers .
yuri orlov .
ow !
fuck !
you run from us?
no , mbizi .
no !
can you run with no legs?
let me make him disappear , mr valentine
around here , people disappear all the time .
i can't do that .
look where we are .
who will know?
we will .
he's gonna get what's coming to him .
i'm not as certain .
all right , get up .
what's the charge?
what are you doing in sierra leone ...
i'm on safari .
yeah?
you're hunting wildebeests with a submachine gun?
do you also work with the park service?
hunting without a license , is that the charge?
why are we playing games?
you traffic arms .
trade .
trade .
traffic .
you get rich by giving the poorest people on the planet the means to continue killing each other .
do you know why i do what i do?
i mean , there are more prestigious assignments .
keeping track of nuclear arsenals ,
you'd think that's more critical to world security , but it's not .
no , nine out of ten war victims today are killed with assault rifles and small like yours .
those nuclear missiles?
they sit in their silos .
your ak 47?
that is the real weapon of mass destruction .
i don't want people dead , agent valentine .
i don't put a gun to anybody's head and make them shoot .
i admit , but shooting war is better for business , but i prefer people to fire my guns and miss .
just as long as they're firing .
can i go now?
you've got nothing on me .
except cuffs .
since you're so concerned with the law , you must know that i'm legally permitted to hold you for twenty four hours without charging you .
you might ask why i would do that and i can assure you .
it's not because i enjoy your company , because i don't .
no , the reason why
i'll delay you for every second of the permissible twenty four hours
is i'm delaying your deadly trade and the deaths of your victims .
i don't think of it as taking a day from you ... ... but giving a day to them .
some innocent man , woman , or child is going to have an extra day on this earth because you're not free .
so , i will see you in twenty three hours and fifty five minutes , hm?
valentine knew he didn't have to guard me .
there was nowhere to go .
or maybe he was hoping the locals would tear me apart .
but they were too busy with the plane .
it's like parking your car in certain neighborhoods in the bronx .
you just don't do it .
the way i looked at it it's the way of africa , maybe life .
everything that comes from the earth eventually returns .
even a 40 ton atonov 12 cargo plane .
a gift .
for you .
you know , you've arrived just in time .
i was afraid that he might die before you got your chance to kill him .
this man came here hoping to take your place .
is that not so?
no , i'm not here to supply mr. baptiste .
i am here to supply his enemies .
i fear it's a sale i shall never complete .
he killed your blood ... your uncle ... when he tried to kill you .
no .
no?
you want that i should let him go?
no .
i ...
you do want him dead .
you just ... don't want to have to do it yourself .
so .
we will do this together .
this will be a bonding experience .
you know you can stop this any time that you want .
but i don't think that you do .
just say the word .
say it .
stop .
stop .
i will get you another room , my friend .
with a much nicer view .
he ordered you brown brown , mr. yuri .
what?
brown brown .
what is it?
a mixture of cocaine ... ... and gunpowder .
they give it to the young boys before they do battle .
they'll do anything !
some other time .
i suggest you try it , at least once , mr. yuri .
why?
'cause it's your gunpowder .
even before that night ,
i'd started doing a lot of cocaine in west africa .
i'd never tried brown brown before , but then i'd never killed a man , either .
oh .
oh , i didn't do anything , did l?
i didn't do anything , did l?
you didn't do much .
wait .
are you sick?
slda?
alds?
ask the white man .
he will know .
sir , will my hand grow back?
simeon .
remember , yuri , take sides .
simeon !
don't !
he's andre's .
fuck andre !
fuck andre !
i'm sorry they don't usually do that .
let me look it .
maybe i can fix it .
let me see it .
it's the magazine .
give it to me .
fuck you !
i started to feel i'd been cursed . ... the curse of invincibility .
nicki , please , go to your room .
i don't believe you .
can you prove any of this?
mr. orlov goes to a lot of trouble to make his business look legitimate .
even to you .
perhaps especially to you .
i don't expect we'll find anything here today .
so what do you want?
i was hoping that you would help me .
i understand that uh ... your parents died tragically?
the illegal firearms used to murder your mother and father were procured from men exactly like your husband .
i'd like you to leave .
okay .
gentlemen .
ava?
ava , what's wrong?
i can't wear the clothes .
can't wear the jewelry .
can't drive the car .
can't live in this house .
everything's got blood on it .
blood on it?
what's the matter with you?
don't be so melodramatic .
i'm melodramatic .
i'm a failed actress , remember?
i told you , these people , it's political .
they lie .
they're liars .
look at me .
they lie to make themselves look good , okay?
you can't trust them .
it's not just them .
don't worry .
your family didn't say anything .
they didn't have to .
i sell people a means to defend themselves .
ava .
that's all .
yuri , i see the news .
i see those pictures .
the guns are bigger than the boys !
there is nothing illegal about what i do !
i don't care if it's legal !
it's wrong !
please , stop .
it makes no difference if i stop .
someone will take my place the next day .
so let them .
we have enough .
it's not about the money .
then what is it?
i'm good at it .
i feel like all i've done my whole life is be pretty .
i mean all i've done is be born .
i'm a failed actress , a failed artist .
i'm not much good as a mother .
i'm not even that pretty anymore .
i have failed at everything , yuri .
but i won't fail as a human being .
my enemies had finally found a weapon that could hurt me .
for the next six months ,
i stopped running guns .
i went legitimate .
this is an untapped market .
i'm talking over five million cubic meters of timber in the first year alone .
over 100 exploitable species .
the oil?
between you and me , this ...
ten thousand barrels a month?
he must be lying .
he's talking !
listen , there are gas reserves off the
ivory coast that opec doesn't even know about .
the phone numbers all check out .
it's all on the level .
no wonder valentine was confused .
thank god there are still legal ways to exploit developing countries .
the only problem with an honest buck is they're so hard to make .
the margins are too low .
too many people are doing it .
still , i'd promised ava .
yuri , the president of liberia is on his way up .
he's early .
i'll be back in a minute .
what the fuck are you doing here , andre?
we are here for peace talks at the united nations .
so at the same time you thought you'd drop in on your arms dealer?
well , i was beginning to wonder whether that was still your profession .
you know , you're a hard man to get a hold of all of sudden .
that is a shame .
my son and i were hoping to do a little shopping . while in new york .
you know they're watching you .
yes , i know they blame me .
they blame me for everything , those hypocrites .
there're hunt for a witch .
witch hunt .
hostilities have escalated .
and they are making it very difficult for me to re supply .
that requires a man of your rare ingenuity .
i can't help you , i'm sorry .
i understand .
due to our present situation we are compelled to be unusually generous .
so , see you soon , lord of war .
you still haven't brought me the gun of rambo .
at four and a half months old ... a human fetus has a reptile's tail ... a remnant of our evolution .
maybe that's what i couldn't escape .
you can fight a lot of enemies and survive , but if you fight your biology , you always lose .
you guys aren't waiting to say goodbye?
i'm not leaving for another ten minutes .
sorry , nicki has swim practice .
you know , i'm kind of glad you're going .
you've been here so long you're starting to get on my nerves .
this oil concession should be wrapped up by thursday .
i'll be back for the weekend .
we'll go somewhere .
the sea .
that would be fun .
come on .
hey .
you trust me , right?
she looked me directly in the eye ... the way i've looked in the eyes of a thousand customs officials ... government bureaucrats and law enforcement agents .
yes , i trust you .
and she lied without flinching .
i'll see you , big guy .
bye papa .
she learned from the best .
have a good trip .
that's him .
where are we going , mama?
it's a game , honey .
like hide and seek?
yes .
like hide and seek .
i can always sense when i'm being tailed .
i know what to look for .
but then i'd never been tailed by the woman i love .
i can put myself in ava's place .
she might've understood if the combination was the last four digits of my social security number ... my birth date , even her birth date , but not nicolai's .
my son's birthday unlocked what the government would later describe ... ... as " a catalogue of carnage .
nicki , stay right there .
come on , nicki .
come to see how the other half lives?
i miss your borscht .
mom and dad say you're clean .
yeah , you , too .
you went legit , huh?
that's hard to believe .
that's because it's not true .
only you know .
i'm leaving tonight on a job
i want you to come .
i can't .
i've got a girlfriend .
i think she might be the one .
plus , i'm thinking of opening my own place .
maybe this trip will help .
it's good money .
yuri , i've given my word .
no one has to know .
tell them we going for a little r and r.
what do you need me for , all of sudden?
west africa's fucked up .
more than usual .
i can't trust anybody .
i need you to watch my back .
brothers in arms .
monrovia , liberia 2001
yuri !
welcome back .
welcome both of you .
welcome to democracy .
democracy?
what have you been drinking , andy?
huh , you have not seen the news .
you know they accuse me of rigging elections .
but after this , with your florida and you supreme court of kangaroos ,
now , the u. s. must shut up forever .
how do you do this , yuri?
how do you do this , when they are watching all of my airspace?
where there's a will , there's a weapon .
come on , where's my fucking money?
when it is delivered .
it is delivered .
this is not for me .
this is for my neighbors to the west .
the west?
we're going to sierra leone .
oh , yes .
and my son baptiste junior will go with you to make the proper introductions .
we have no trucks .
you will .
as soon as we get the food out of them .
gun of rambo .
mr. yuri , you're a man of your word .
so where are we going?
ruf the freedom fighters .
every faction in africa calls themselves by the noble names .
liberation this patriotic that ,
democratic republic of something or other .
i guess they can't own up to what they usually are
federation of worse oppressors than the last bunch of oppressors .
often , the most barbaric atrocities occur when both combatants proclaim themselves " freedom fighters .
right , i've got 500 units , brand new right out of the box , all as clean as this .
what have you got?
god !
oh , jesus .
god !
oh , jesus .
yuri , i need to talk to you .
not now .
now .
excuse me .
what?
we can't do this deal .
the fuck we can't !
what's the matter with you?
look , over there .
as soon as we hand over the guns those people are going to die !
it's not our business .
they killed a boy just now as young as nicki .
what is the holdup?
there is no holdup .
i'll be right there .
we can't control what they do .
no , no , today we can .
today we can .
yuri , they're right there !
what do you think they'll do to us if we back out?
they'll kill us .
and if we go ahead , what do you think they'll do to them?
we've got to do something .
please , for fuck's sake .
it's not our fight .
please .
brothers in arms .
what is he saying?
it's the deal .
my brother's not happy with the terms .
we'll work it out .
it's nothing .
right?
it's nothing .
yeah .
nothing .
you're right .
yuri , you're right .
god , i've got to get my shit together .
this is not our fight .
right .
okay .
what's the deal?
300 rpgs , 500 assault rifles and 800 grenades .
i thought it was 1200 grenades .
i was so caught up in the deal ...
i never realized what was going on in vitaly's head .
i thought it was 1200 grenades .
confused .
come to think about it , maybe i never understood what was going on in his head .
i beg your pardon .
may i see another stone?
one thing i do understand for certain ... ... is that vitaly broke the cardinal rule of gunrunning .
never pick up a gun and join the customers .
what are you doing?
something for yuri .
step away .
slow .
no , vit !
no !
vit !
only half the guns were gone ... so i was still entitled to half the diamonds .
if i took them , i was lost .
if i left them , i was lost .
the massacre played out exactly how vitaly predicted .
but then , a half dozen other massacres happened in sierra leone that week .
you can't stop them all .
in my experience , you can't stop any of them .
they say evil prevails when good men fail to act .
what they ought to say is , evil prevails .
i now shared even more in common ... with the leader of that country god seemed to have forsaken .
we saw something in each other that neither of us liked .
or maybe we were just looking in the mirror .
i paid a monrovian doctor twenty dollars to remove the lead from vitaly's body and write a bogus death certificate .
i should've paid more .
i've smuggled millions of rounds of ammunition , and the bullet that lands me in jail ... is found under my dead brother's rib .
yuri orlov .
we're with the bureau of alcohol , tobacco , and firearms .
let me guess .
this is not about the alcohol or the tobacco .
crimean restaurant .
papa?
both my sons are dead .
there are only two tragedies in life .
one is not getting what you want .
the other is getting it .
is this one of yours?
jack valentine finally had what he wanted .
curiously , the death certificate says he died of heart failure .
falsifying a death certificate?
that's not gonna hold me .
you're right .
as usual , you are right .
have you seen today's paper?
huh?
fake end user certificates .
cut out companies , meticulously catalogued .
there is hardly a warlord , dictator , despot anywhere in the world that you're a first name basis with .
it was your wife your trophy wife that led us to the prize .
it's not her fault .
she's just easier to follow than you are .
may l?
yeah , go ahead .
enjoy it .
what?
this .
tell me i'm everything you despise .
that i'm the personification of evil . what? responsible for the breakdown of the fabric of society and world order .
i'm a one man genocide .
say everything you want to say to me now .
because you don't have long .
are you paying attention?
or are you delusional?
you have broken every arms embargo written .
there is enough here to put you away for consecutive life sentences .
you are going to spend the next ten years of your life going from a cell to a courtroom before you even start serving your time .
i don't think you fully appreciate the seriousness ... ... of your situation .
my family has disowned me .
my wife and son have left me .
my brother's dead .
trust me .
i fully appreciate the seriousness of my situation .
but i promise you ,
i won't spend a single second in a courtroom .
you are delusional .
i like you , jack .
well , maybe not , but i understand you .
let me tell you what's gonna happen .
this way , you can prepare yourself .
okay .
soon there's going to be a knock on that door and you will be called outside .
in the hall there will be a man who outranks you .
first , he'll compliment you on the fine job you've done that you're making the world a safer place that you're to receive a commendation and a promotion .
and then he'll tell you that i am to be released .
you're gonna protest .
you'll probably threaten to resign .
but in the end , i will be released .
the reason i'll be released is the same reason you think ...
i'll be convicted .
i do rub shoulders with some of the most vile , sadistic men calling themselves leaders today .
but some of those men are the enemies of your enemies .
and while the biggest arms dealer in the world is your boss ... ... the president of the united states , who ships more merchandise in a day
i do in a year ... sometimes it's embarrassing to have his fingerprints on the guns .
sometimes he needs a freelancer like me to supply forces he can't be seen supplying .
so ... you call me evil , but unfortunately for you , i'm a necessary evil .
i would tell you to go to hell .
but i think you're already there .
pleasure doing business with you .
most people are happy just to get out of jail .
i expect to be paid to leave .
i'm not a fool .
i know that just because they needed me that day didn't mean they wouldn't make me a scapegoat the next .
but i was back , doing what i do best .
umbrellas to the sahara?
sun umbrellas .
you know who's going to inherit the earth?
arms dealers .
because everyone else is too busy killing each other .
that's the secret to survival .
never go to war .
especially with yourself .
