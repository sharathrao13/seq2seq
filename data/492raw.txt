all units reporting clear , the building is clear , we're all out .
copy that .
it's never an easy thing .
saying good bye to a brother firefighter .
and this time is particularly difficult for me because i watched jack growing to a one of the finest firefighters i've ever known .
he joined this department because he wanted to help people .
who knows how many homes is still standing because jack was there .
how many lives were spared .
he gave his life for that cause .
we'll never forget you , jack .
and we are better for ever knowing you .
but i make you this one promise , tomorrow we will be back on the truck .
because you was the bravest of the brave .
how is it that firefighters run to a burning building , when everyone else is running out?
jack , he would answer that question by saving another man's life .
your courage is the answer .
and today we will be as brave as you .
i'm not mourning you , i'm celebrating your life .
so i'd like everyone to stand up and celebrate the life of jack morrison .
