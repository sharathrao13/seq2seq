i'm here for your stuff , man .
tommy : ... that the lord save us his anointing .
ye will hear him in his holy heaven , and the saving strength of his right hand .
be careful with this .
don't worry about it , man .
close 1 3 !
worry's all i've got . ... some in chariots , some in horses . but we remember the name of the lord , our god .
they're brought down and fallen , but we are risen and stand upright .
save us , lord .
let the king hear us when we call him .
sky surfing is when you skydive , with a board attached to your feet , and try to do different maneuvers .
a camera flyer flies with a camera on top of a helmet , filming the sky surfer ... and flies with the sky surfer for capturing the moves .
my camera flyer is my husband , craig o'brien .
i'm gonna put these on nice and loose .
everything's gonna be okay , right?
yes , sir .
what about my last phone call?
warden says it's a bad idea .

maybe you could call my son and tell him that i tried .
i don't think so .
okay .
open 1 3 .
our freefall is usually around 60 seconds , and the normal altitude we jump from is 1 2, 500 feet .

starting to feel a little cramped by your present surroundings?
maybe it's time to expand your horizons .
maybe it's time to think about remax .

remax can help you find a new home that meets all your needs , while selling your current house to someone who will find it absolutely perfect .
if you're looking for results , look for remax .

i never was a very good father .
he was a good kid .
i guess that somehow i just when i see what you're going through there it made me think about something .
i don't know .
you know when you feel like you can't breathe?
and you can't get out to from inside yourself , you know?
really .
do you want to come inside?
i like these curtains .
i got these here curtains on credit .

i bring some popeye's chicken , that boy eat the whole thing before i can get a bite !
he would eat his ass off !
you haven't seen nobody eat like
he would eat candy and gumballs .
he'd make me take him to the super k mart and he put them quarters in that gumball machine .
he had to wait till he get the red gumball .
he always had to get the red gumball .
he sounds like a character , i guess .
he'd get that red gumball and he'd just eat on that red gumball .

i did every single thing i can think to do
i was really good .
i was really good .
i was a good mother .

oh , yes .
'cause ...
i want him to go out in peace .
you must love him very much .
