why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free?
it's a fascinating philosophical query , marriage versus sex .
and if you're considering the former ... ... odds are you'll hear the saying from a friend ... ... who claims to be getting an abundant amount of the latter .
and incidentally , it's bullshit .
bullshit .
you think this is bullshit .
yeah .
well , it isn't .
after five years , i think i have the right to broach the subject .
so you broach and we talk .
you don't have to go and give me an ultimatum .
don't use that word .
i hate that word .
i'm not too fond of it either , but what else would you call this?
a deadline .
so i'm a little indecisive .
that doesn't mean you have to hold a gun to my head .
sorry .
don't be so melodramatic .
that's why i'm taking this transfer .
i'll be 3, 000 miles away .
i can't hold a gun to your head .
stop saying that !
shit .
admit it .
you're using this transfer thing as an ultim ...
deadline .
okay .
so i wouldn't have signed up for it if you hadn't freaked on tyler's news .
hello .
david !
what's up , what's up?
tyler , you are wasted .
sarah .
damn .
how'd you know , my brother?
the faux urban street slang .
nigger , please !
what time is it back there , like 2 : 00?
you know this city never sleeps .
y'all be counting on your sheep .
listen , man , i met the most amazing woman .
she is ...
fly?
better than fly .
she's super fly .
what did i tell you about drinking and dating?
go to bed and sleep her off .
we're getting married !
what?
you got to meet her , you and sarah .
she's like ...
super fly?
better than super fly , man .
she's the one .
you know how they say that you can just tell?
david?
you still there , bitch?
yeah , i'm here .
i'm just ...
this is it , man .
it just hit me .
it was like a blinding realisation .
like pure truth .
anyway , you and sarah got to meet her .
you're gonna love her .
her name's julie .
she's sweet , she's beautiful ... ... she's " chocolicious " ...
tyler?
hello !
tyler , you okay?
sounds like true love .
so you are leaving me alone to deal with this for two months .
you need to be alone to deal with this .
which is why i strongly advise you against consulting with mike .
bellissimo .
magnifico .
you are so hot !
you beast .
is that ricky martin over there?
god , no .
it's mike hanson .
you're beautiful .
modesty , now .
modesty .
i love you .
no words .
no , i'm not .
yes , i am .
don't do it .
i'm doing it .
don't do it .
i did it .
i'd do me .
oh , man !
the " testy " tuck again?
do you like what you see?
no?
would you put on some clothes?
we only got two hours of " happy hour " left .
let me just get my towel , okay?
got it .
there we go .
you got issues , i mean , real issues .
he may be your friend , but he's no deepak chopra .
he is also not running off to new york .
use this time to make an informed decision or none of this'll mean anything .
i can't let this not mean anything .
so you love her , right?
of course i love her .
there you go .
let's not get carried away here , guys .
no one's doubting your love for each other .
a blind man could smell your love .
but this is a major ...
huge .
no , colossal , thing you're considering here .
as your friend , it's my duty to ask the tough questions .
what?
sex .
sex is still good?
the sex is awesome .
i've got no complaints about what we have .
it would be a lot easier if i did .
it's got to be something .
you waited five years .
so what is it?
it's nothing .
let's drop it .
we're your friends .
we want to help you .
but we can't do it unless you let us in !
it's no one thing !
there's a lot of factors in these kind of situations .
so what is it?
give us one .
other women , all right?
you've had other women?
how many?
i'm not quite sure that i've had enough .
that's ridiculous .
how many is enough?
twice your age .
it's not about quantity , it's about quality .
what's wrong with going for both quality and quantity?
being the best he can be , that's the american way .
foul .
foul?
it's foul .
what foul?
humping before the shot .
i was humping you?
prison style .
whatever .
if i was humping you , you'd know it .
would i?
yeah , you'd know it .
you'd feel it .
i wasn't humping you .
deep , right?
yep .
a little help?
the thing is , i never expected to feel empowered .
for better , for worse , something is set into motion ... ... and i set it off .
am i a manipulative bitch or what?
welcome to my world .
you should feel empowered .
it wasn't easy , but it had to be done .
what was the alternative , to keep waiting?
it's not like the sex gets better with every passing year .
am i right?
i'm sorry that was so quick .
i'm kind of beat .
that's okay .
orgasms are overrated anyway .
hey , south park is on .
buddy boy , it's time to shit or get off the pot .
and marrying me would be the " shit " part of that colourful analogy?
thanks .
i'm sorry , i don't get it .
sarah is hot .
behind every good looking chick is a guy who's tired of nailing her .
am i right , davey?
no , you're wrong , asshole .
cowgirls , wilder chicks , the amish , what?
it's not like that .
let's just drop it , all right?
do you guys believe in " the one "?
as in one soul mate?
the perfect match that completes us , makes us whole?
exactly .
hell , no .
i don't know .
but if there's such a thing and sarah's it ... ... then that means it's inevitable .
it's a lock , right?
it's like destiny .
i guess so .
okay .
so , if it's inevitable , why rush into it?
you're still not telling us everything .
of course , i'm not .
you're my friends .
it's stupid , it's stupid .
come on , help us help you .
please , man .
okay .
i'm going to tell you guys a little story .
i have never told anyone this before .
ever .
when i was 18 years old ... ... my family and i were flying home ... ... from a vacation we took in the caribbean .
it was a fun time .
very nice beaches .
club med .
we were in line to get on board ... ... when i happened to glance over to the gate across from us ... ... and that's when i saw her .
she glowed .
it was like a light all around her .
it was blinding .
i swear i have never felt anything that powerful before or since .
something about her sucked me away from the plane ... ... and drew me right back to her .
there she was .
with strength i wish i still possessed ... ... i floated towards her .
i introduced myself and told her how i felt .
i gave her my address ... ... and told her if she felt it too , she should write .
young blood had him some balls .
i had no choice .
i was being driven by a higher power .
call it " the lightning bolt , " call it a connection , destiny , whatever .
so did she write you?
not at first .
every day i'd check that mailbox .
i checked all that summer , and nothing .
then one day , it came .
it was more than i could've hoped for .
she professed her love to me .
she said that she , too , got a jolt down her spine ... ... that glorious day we first met .
it was more beautiful and poetic than she was ... ... which i didn't think was possible at the time .
i immediately wrote her back .
i told her that i wanted us to run away together ... ... make love under the stars .
make babies .
it was clear to both of us .
we belonged together .
no fear , no doubt .
perfect .
young love .
too young .
as it turned out .
apparently she was an amazingly ... ... hyper developed 11 year old girl .
what?
eleven?
her parents found my letters and ... ... quite understandably freaked out .
they contacted our local authorities ... ... who swiftly moved in to stop the town's budding paedophile .
they made my father promise that his sicko son ... ... would cease contact with any more little girls .
they left him to scream at me for over an hour about ... ... how i could flush any chances of a political career down the toilet .
that's a fucked up story , man .
you're the only people i've ever told .
can you keep it that way?
it makes you seem kind of creepy .
david collins graphics .
hey .
sarah , hey , how are you?
i just thought i'd call and see how you were .
i'm fine .
how are you?
how's new york?
busy .
but the city is so incredible .
i wish you were here with me .
oops , shit .
oops , shit , " what?
why " oops , shit "?
i made a list of all the things i wasn't going to ... ... say to you like , " i miss you .
i wish you were here .
so how are you?
miss you .
wish you were here , all that .
i talked to tyler .
he and i are going to try to get together for dinner .
so maybe i'll get to meet the fiancee .
great .
be sure and thank them for ruining my life .
listen , i just wanted to let you know that i made it here okay .
oh .
is that it?
well , i got to get back to work .
so i should go .
yeah , me , too .
okay .
'bye , david .
i'm just saying , it's been a week and a half now ... ... and all you've done is sit around the apartment .
it's no good .
she wants me to give the situation serious thought ... ... that's exactly what i'm trying to do .
finish it , tiny !
and how's that working out so far?
been doing a lot of thinking?
no !
you are useless !
what was that?
he can't do that .
actually , i think he can .
she wants me to make an informed decision ... ... and i'm gonna respect that .
no , what she wants is for you to wallow around your apartment ... ... like some socially retarded hermit .
ante up .
who do you like?
give me $5 on super thong .
i'm gonna take the one with the nice rack .
she is banking on your misery , bro , hoping you'll sit around bumming out .
that's got to hurt .
and that , my friend , is how you make an uninformed decision .
you want to make a truly informed decision?
get off your ass and go see what it's like out there .
get in the game .
the game?
i. e .
hitting the meat market clubs with you .
no .
hitting them with me and jonesy .
there are some major fundamental problems i have with ... ... " why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free? " conundrum .
for one thing , women are not cows .
and by that i mean , not so generic .
i think most reasonable people would agree ... ... that a cow is a cow is a cow .
this is not true of women .
things might be simpler if it were .
yo , mike !
excuse me .
scotch .
it's packed .
yeah , busy .
thank you .
excuse me .
you might have offered to help me .
if you please?
a beer for my friend?
thank you .
i'm sorry to do this to you , but i got to go .
hey , asshole , what is your problem?
you shouldn't drink anymore .
why shouldn't i?
i just got here .
because you're driving me home .
oh , god .
oh , god .
hey .
buy you a drink?
actually , i'm think i'm gonna leave .
you aren't married , are you?
not yet .
you better hurry , though .
another round .
did mikey show?
yes .
cute .
how'd he play?
actually , i think he used the " you're less than nothing to me " strategy .
it never fails , man .
you miss her , huh?
are you kidding?
surrounded by all these available women?
more than ever .
i know the feeling , only worse .
imagine feeling like that in this place without having anybody to miss .
how you doing?
you ready to go?
okay , so you had a close encounter with something .
you saw the light in the airport .
and 10 years later , it's still messing with your head .
it was important .
it set the bar for me on some level .
is that so bad?
it's bad if it keeps you from hooking up with a woman ... ... who's attractive , smart , and of legal , consenting age .
what if she's still out there?
don't i owe it to myself ... ... to try and find her?
you're hunting sasquatch .
see .
there she is .
the shadow lady?
she's a sasquatch?
she's a myth .
the perfect woman .
a figment of our dumb ass male imagination .
slap a face on the shadow bitch , and she ceases to be perfect ... ... because she becomes real .
so what exactly is all this crap?
it's market research .
insurance for the creatives who came up with this shitty campaign .
if i can coerce a focus group ... ... to say that a picture of an anorexic model ... ... bottle feeding two large men in diapers ... ... makes them want to buy a pair of jeans , then i've done my job .
that is a twisted way to make a living .
i know .
but at least it's the fashion biz , right?
so why don't you just move here?
i don't know .
maybe i will .
who is that?
it's mr. hahn .
my boss .
and you get paid?
look at it mathematically .
if just one person hooks up with somebody who isn't their soul mate ... ... you got a chain reaction that screws it up for everybody on the planet .
your soul mate ends up with someone else's who settles for someone else's ...
which makes it all the more important to find the right person .
it's a glass half empty , glass half full scenario .
if you ask me , the glass is half full of crap .
you sure you don't want any late night eats?
no .
i'm out of here .
take care , man .
you got a problem?
how's the chili?
i'd give my right arm for a bowl .
i'll hand that ...
i'll have that .
oh , my god .
my god , that was the glow .
that was the feeling you got in the airport .
it's happening again .
i'm gonna do this .
can you do this?
you've done it before , you can do it again .
go !
i'm gonna do this .
i'm gonna do this .
can you?
can you?
don't let her get away .
where did she go?
where did that girl go?
what's your problem?
she left , crap sack .
creep .
wait up !
stop !
stop !
stop !
wait up !
don't go !
don't !
quick match personals .
may i help you?
i'd like to place a personal ad .
i'm sorry , can you please speak up?
a personal ad .
i want to place a personal ...
hello .
is anyone there?
hello?
i'm sorry .
i dropped the phone .
i'm here .
this is my first time .
okay .
here goes .
wanted ... ... soul mate .
potential soul mate looking for his soul mate .
you , soul mate material .
me , open , intelligent , and ...
soul matey?
yes .
who's dead?
somebody better be dead .
hey , tyler , it's mikey .
did i wake you?
what time is it?
it's 1 : 00 in the morning , 4 : 00 to you .
sorry , man .
what's wrong?
what happened?
nothing .
i just wanted to talk .
at 4 : 00 in the morning?
it's cheaper .
listen , ty , how'd you do it?
how'd i do what?
how did you , you know ...
how did you find somebody who made the cut?
i don't know .
it was just this feeling that hit me .
like a blinding realisation , like pure truth .
mikey , what is this all about?
nothing .
nothing .
forget it .
congratulations .
mike?
yeah?
pull this shit again , you don't get to be my best man .
yeah , yeah , yeah .
always a best man , never a man .
oh , my god , this is so exciting .
i think i just met naomi campbell's hair person .
so , anything i should be doing?
this is the glamorous world of market research .
we just sit around until somebody wonders .
why are those men wearing diapers?
i guess i can answer that question for you , sir .
you can answer that?
yes .
we did research in the midwest which indicated ... ... that our target market was getting younger and younger ... ... as you can see .
our focus groups taught us that it'd be wise to do a preemptive strike ... ... and showcase young imagery in our new campaigns .
i see and this explains why i'm spending $2 million ... ... putting grown men in huggies .
you realise if i did this in my basement ... ... and post them on the internet , i'd be arrested .
also save a lot of money .
what are you doing for lunch?
i'm sorry julie couldn't make it tonight .
she really does want to meet you .
me , too .
yeah .
but at least now you can tell me how all of this happened .
you used to refer to marriage as ...
i know , cruel and unusual punishment .
it's her .
she just hit me like a truck .
but you were ready for it , right?
you were wandering around in traffic?
yeah , i guess it was in traffic .
i mean , if it can happen to me , it can happen to anybody .
right?
anybody who isn't mike , of course .
i actually got a strange call from mike the other day .
i think he seemed genuinely concerned not to have somebody in his life .
mike , in a relationship?
isn't that one of the signs of the apocalypse?
nostradamus actually predicted it .
he said , in the latter part of the twentieth century ... ... " the lone cock would crow no more .
that's scary .
why do you think david's so reluctant to take the next step with me?
oh , david .
i was playing the field , and i got burned out on it .
david hasn't exactly been out playing the field .
he's been playing house with me .
a fun game .
so let me get this straight .
by working in a relationship with this guy for the past five years ... ... i have actually undermined any possibility of a future with him?
yeah .
maybe .
i don't know .
david's a really sharp guy ... ... and i think he'll probably come to his senses .
i mean , you're all he wants .
i'm all he knows .
that can work .
david , it's me .
it's late and you're not home .
that's good .
i hope you're out having fun .
i know this sounds weird ... ... but if you need to see other women to figure this out ... ... i can handle it .
maybe it's being here on my own or from asking you for a decision .
i've gained a new perspective on things .
i think it's important for us to explore whatever options we need to .
so , if that's part of it for you just know that i understand .
i know what you mean .
she second guessed our move .
she's even more cunning than i thought .
she's good .
you're lucky i'm on board .
it's not like her .
why would she say it's okay to go out with other women?
why indeed?
shouldn't you be out there playing wingman for jonesy?
oh , please .
i never realised you were so picky .
you think i'm one of these assy scam hounds?
i have very particular tastes .
a strict list of qualities i look for in a woman .
i'm not just fucking around out here .
what?
seriously , all this play i get?
i'm not wasting my time .
it's practice .
it's practice for the big game .
maybe it's not a game .
you've been off the circuit too long .
of course , it's a game .
it's better than a game , it's a sport .
it's better than a sport , even .
it's sport fishing .
case in point .
look at him .
see those chicks he's wasting it on .
hi , ladies !
those are bass .
and we all go bass fishing from time to time .
hell , you can get really good at it with practice .
but while he's spending all his time hooking up with bottom feeders ... ... the crucial skills he'll need to hook his wife are atrophying .
you see , scamming is like fishing .
if your dream girl were a fish , what would she be?
i don't know , a tuna?
yeah !
no .
a marlin .
a big trophy fish .
to catch a marlin , you must use entirely different skills .
you don't go out marlin fishing with a sorry ass fold out pole , six pound test .
that'll do for bass .
but it sure as shit isn't gonna land a marlin .
you have to up your game .
know where the elusive beauties lie .
you gotta know where to fish .
they're rare , brother .
they're rare .
most days you don't catch shit .
but when you do ...
wham !
the two of you are back at the dock taking pictures .
okay , another huge flaw i have ... ... with " why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free? " ... ... is simply this .
milk is not free .
the point is , if you're hankering for some milk ... ... one way or another , you're gonna have to pay for it !
you digging this , davey?
i told you i'd make it up to you .
please point out which of these lovely young ladies is a marlin .
we're done fishing for the day .
we're at the aquarium now , checking out the exotic fishies .
look , davey .
they even got one of those petting tanks .
oh , my god .
i have already told him all about you , and his friend is totally hot .
sarah , come on .
you have got to get my back .
i have been after this guy for almost a week .
they're gonna be here in an hour .
so , come on , just get my back .
i have to go .
i'll do what i can .
'bye .
hi .
hey .
have you given any thought to our conversation the other day?
it's all i've been thinking about .
but the problem is , i'm involved with someone back in la .
but i'm not sure what's happening with us .
i just need a little more time to figure it out .
is that okay?
of course .
just don't take too long .
gosh , a dollar .
now i can quit stripping , go back to vet school ... ... and save my sick pony .
thanks , mike .
you're a prince .
amy !
david , you know her !
holy shit !
it is amy .
give me a sec .
i have to make one last go around .
you guys know her?
from school .
i can't believe this is happening .
i can't believe this is happening .
she looks great .
she definitely lost that " freshman 15 .
she looks hot .
damn !
hey , you guys .
how are you two?
you work here?
this is awesome .
no , mike , i'm just hanging .
this is such a surprise .
yeah .
you look good , david .
amy , this is jonesy .
jonesy , this is amy .
how you doing?
pleasure to meet you .
the pleasure is all mine .
why don't you turn it down a notch?
you're channelling barry white again .
was she this hot when you two were dating?
he went out with a stripper?
yeah .
actually , no .
i was just a freshman back then ... ... studying to be a stripper .
david helped me bone up on my pole dancing exam .
can i buy you a drink for old times 'sake?
yeah .
come on .
they're going to do it .
i often wonder how long we would've lasted if i hadn't broken up with you .
two and a half days .
i was gonna dump you right after my last final .
i didn't have the time to get into a big emotional thing with you .
i had to study .
what a relief .
this whole time , i thought i broke your heart .
give me a break .
we weren't in love or anything .
we were just having fun .
there were no expectations back then .
give me a hand with this .
i mean , when did that change?
it didn't .
you did .
it only seems different now because you outgrew it .
i don't know .
i do .
look at your dick with ears friend there .
do you think that amy chick would take the bid?
i thought that was dave's old flame .
key word : " was .
damn it !
i bet i could have had her .
when she was going out with your best friend .
yeah , that would have been real cool .
you bet .
although , i'm sure she wasn't as hot then .
you look unbelievable .
thanks .
when did it get so difficult to figure out what i want?
if you're like most people , darlin '... ... right around the time you found something worth wanting .
hand me that dildo , will you?
she circled my ad .
she circled my ad !
quick match mailbox number 247 .

hola , soul mate .
i have searched for you for a long time .
i think we should get together .
i have dark hair , dark eyes and a nipple key ring .
i'm a maid , so i have lots of keys .
your ad intrigued me , soul mate .
i love dressing up and getting down .
i'm a walking contradiction ... ... open minded , yet lactose intolerant .
and i yearn for someone who enjoys big surprises .
call me .
if you'd like to make a call , please hang up and try again .
hello , david .
i've been waiting for your call ... ... ever since i saw you in that mexican restaurant .
i've fantasised about us .
our bodies entwined and covered in salsa .
salsa !
we're destined to be together , david .
it's just like ...
chips and salsa .
that's right .
and now ...
that's my other line .
hold on .
hello .
david , it's mike .
you there?
pick up .
come on , pick up , david .
this is important .
mike .
david , it's happened to me .
congratulations .
look , i'm really not feeling very ...
no !
listen , david .
i'm lying naked , in a strange bed ... ... staring at the most beautiful woman ... ... i have ever seen in my entire life .
tell her i said , " hi .
i've really got to go now .
she's not here .
i'm looking at her picture , okay?
damn marlin jumped right into my boat , caught me unawares .
what are you talking about?
that whole after hours rave?
complete blank .
the last solid memory i have was drinking some green , glowy shit ... ... from a test tube and dancing like a bastard .
but , david ...
what?
something magical happened in this room last night .
something ... ... bigger than sex .
although sex was definitely a factor .
but you don't remember .
no .
last night's a total blur .
but listen to me .
i woke up this morning and i've got ...
... the feeling .
is it a burning sensation?
no , david .
the feeling ... ... when you just know the pure , blinding truth stuff .
i've met her , david .
for the first time in my life , i think i'm in love .
me .
shit .
here she comes .
moment of truth .
'bye .
good morning , sunshine !
is that for me?
whoops .
you've been , deflowered .
i can't believe you're even up after that performance last night .
in my book , you deserve to sleep for a week .
hungover and clumsy .
i'll take care of that .
you just save your strength .
the bathroom?
what?
the bathroom .
i don't feel too well .
it's right around the corner , lover .
you pretty boys are all the same .
strong stamina and weak stomachs .
it's right there .
you okay in there?
this isn't happening .
michael?
just a sec !
laura was pretty impressed with you last night ... ... even before you two started waking the neighbourhood .
i'm into chicks .
i love chicks .
breasts , legs , long hair .
and breasts .
i've never seen her make breakfast for herself .
and we've been roommates for three years .
laura ran to the store to get you some b12 ... ... and she should be back soon .
dad .
sit down .
i'm gay .
no !
or i was fucked up or experimenting .
you know , like mom's college years .
oh , god , it is genetic .
michael , i'll be out on the deck , okay?
when you're done , let's talk .

i'm going straight to hell for this .

sorry , i'm meeting someone .
i have to get out of here .
hi , david .
nicole , what are you doing in la?
i'm in town for my cousin's bar mitzvah .
what are you doing?
i'm leaving .
this place is such a meat market .
it's a total singles scene .
did you just call him david?
yeah .
that is his name .
it's my nickname .
my close friends call me that .
david , what are you talking about?
who the hell has david for a nickname?
i do .
it's short for davidian .
branch davidian .
are you here to meet a david , too?
yeah .
who are you?
did you answer an ad in quick match personals?
david , do you know these women?
you son of a ...
soul mate , my ass !
stop it , please !
excuse me , i'm supposed to meet someone here named ...
some shit monkey invited four women from the same dating service !
why?
why?
look , just get down here , all right?
and send ambulances , lots of them .
i'm sorry !
i'm sorry !
i've been a bad boy !
i'm sorry !
how does it look?
is it bad?
no .
you're good .
so , we're about the same age .
tell me , how does one develop such intense hatred for women ... ... in a short amount of time?
publicly humiliating four women you've never met before?
i thought maybe i had met one of them before .
i was wrong .
go ahead , call sarah .
rat my miserable ass out .
forget it .
i'd lash out at an entire gender too if i had your problems .
it must be tough .
you're the last person i would have expected sympathy from on all this .
it can't be easy .
especially now .
what do you mean , now?
maybe you'd better call her .
sarah , pick up the damn ...
hello .
hello , sarah?
this is amber .
i work with sarah .
can i take a message?
i need to know where she is .
she left a little early today .
had a dinner engagement .
an appointment .
with who?
who is this?
this is her boyfriend , david .
i didn't know she had a boyfriend .
she does .
listen , i'm sorry .
i really don't know who you are ... ... but i'd appreciate it if you told me who she was ...
she's out with andrew .
mr. hahn .
mr. hung?
yeah , the big guy .
are you sure you're her boyfriend?
i mean , she knows that you're her boyfriend and everything right?
so how long have you been married?
seven years .
must be nice to have that kind of security .
i'm the poster boy for happily married .
but security , that's a rare thing these days ... ... especially in marriage .
that's a sombre outlook for the happily married , poster boy .
fifty percent divorce rate in the us .
the only security you have in this world is yourself .
the point i'm making , sarah , is your talent is yours alone .
and you do have talent , sarah .
your designs are amazing .
only you can decide what you want to do with that talent .
i just wish it were simpler .
simpler?
i'm offering you a job in new york doing what you love doing .
i know .
and it's a dream come true .
dreams don't come true very often .
maybe it's not supposed to be simple .
bellissimo .
magnifico .
mike , it's me .
where you been , man?
i haven't heard from you since you met your true love .
i've really got to talk to you .
so why don't you just pick up the phone and give me a call between orgasms , okay?
from the makers of the hit videos , are you gay? ... and so you think you're gay ... ... united homosexual headquarters presents ... ... just how gay are you?
hello .
i'm tim chadway ... ... president of united homosexual headquarters .
my buddies call me timbo .
you know , like millions of americans ... ... you're probably wondering just how gay are you?
that's an important question .
but , come on , the answer is pretty obvious , isn't it?
face it , chief .
if you're watching me now , you are pretty damn gay .
but that's okay .
because , you see , here at the headquarters ... ... we specialise in making your journey out of the closet ... ... as smooth as possible .
from our handy gay pride starter kit ... ... to those convenient , " i'm here , i'm queer ...
... stop by sometime for a beer " change of sexual orientation post cards ... ... you'll be out and about in no time .
your family and friends will admire you ... ... for your ability to make that transition with style and flair .
i still can't believe it .
why don't you just call her?
you don't even know for sure what's going on .
if she wants to talk , she can give me a call .
i'm done sitting around like a sucker .
you got to stop being hard on yourself .
mike was right .
if i'm gonna make an informed decision , it's time i started getting busy .
wait a minute .
what's this bar that mike wants us to meet him at?
the cock pit .
you might want to wait till tomorrow night to start getting busy .
why is that?
because tonight , we're drinking in boys 'town .
a lot of guys claim they practically knew it in the womb .
like something was wrong ... ... they felt different than all the other fetuses .
how did you figure it out?
after a string of girlfriends ... ... a couple ex wives , and a great dane or two ... ... i started thinking , " hey , maybe it's me .
was that difficult for you?
sure .
most terrifying thing that you can do is look inside yourself carefully , honestly .
but you have to do it , michael .
and when i did , it was a feeling that just hit me .
a blinding realisation like pure truth .
mike , what's up?
guys , hey !
sit down .
are you aware that this is a ...
a gay bar?
it's okay to say it .
and yes , i know .
but i like it , i think .
i'm trying to , anyway .
stanley !
a beer for my friends , please .
i get it .
i get it .
you do?
he's trying to go the distance with that chick he met at after hours .
right .
avoiding places that tempt you to stray ... ... off the gilded path of monogamy .
i can't wait to meet this girl .
she must really be something .
she didn't ... ... turn out to be the person i thought she was .
sorry , man .
i'm sorry .
she sounded different .
let's just drop it , okay?
so what's up with this bar?
this isn't really our kind of place .
what do you mean?
it's got beer .
it's got bar stools .
what more do you need , jonesy?
how about women?
i'm shocked .
i never would have pegged you two as homophobes .
what the hell do you guys have against gay people , anyway?
we've got nothing against gays .
some of my best friends 'friends are gay .
that's right .
holy shit .
what's that?
the mikey chronicles , man .
the sacred scam scrolls .
this is the black book?
i want you to have it , david .
i don't need it anymore .
look at all these numbers .
what are these little black diamonds?
stick to the blue squares .
i'd hate to see you get hurt .
this is bigger than i thought .
that chick must have really snuck up from behind and nailed you .
david?
you must be nikki .
i hope i'm not too early .
so you're a friend of mike's?
yeah .
david , mike owes me $200 .
is cash okay?
hi .
come on in .
david .
what are you doing here?
if you're this upset , then why has it taken you two weeks to call me back?
i've been busy .
never mind that .
who's this guy?
he's my boss .
and all he did was offer me a new position .
what's the matter , our old positions aren't good enough for you anymore?
as a designer .
he wants an answer , but i told him i had to talk to you first .
this is about more than a job offer .
you tell me to explore , to meet other women .
that's got nothing to do with this .
i can't make a decision until i know all the variables ... ... one of which is still in your hands .
great .
so now i'm just a variable .
this has just gotten more complicated .
why don't you just admit it?
you love it there .
you don't want to say no to this offer and i'm not going to be a reason you do .
look , if you already have made up your mind , then say so .
but don't try to hide behind some noble gesture ... ... of not holding me back .
why don't we be fair here?
things have changed , sarah .
this is no longer just my decision .
you're right , it isn't .
and that's why i'm coming home early .
what?
they're paying for me to come home and talk to you .
they really want me , david .
possibly more than you do .
oh , shit .
dave !
what's up , man?
de bachelorising for the little lady .
she gets back today .
what's up?
you didn't get me a coffee?
i didn't know how you took it .
but here , i grabbed your mail on the way in .
so what's the verdict?
i get to comb the thrift stores for a new , used suit or what?
not yet .
i'm just as confused as ever .
are you all right?
just lock up when you leave .
what?
i wasn't sure if you'd be here .
i'm here .
where else would i be?
what's this?
i'm going to new york .
what?
what?
there's somebody i got to see .
what are you talking about?
options , remember?
just in case .
you're out of options !
this means staying here or going back .
these are your options .
sarah .
no , listen .
listen to me carefully .
i flew back here for one reason ... ... and that was to give you a chance to talk me out of taking this job .
i can't do that until i do this .
i won't be here when you get back .
i swear to god , i won't .
this is it , david .
i know .
there are times in life when you have to make extremely difficult choices .
and there are times when it seems like you don't have a choice at all .
like those rare moments ... ... when your only option practically shows up in your mailbox .
david !
tyler .
i'm psyched you're here .
you look great .
it really means a lot to me .
so what the hell are you doing here?
i know it's sudden .
i just wanted to see you .
things are gonna start getting crazy for you and julie .
and i wanted to see you .
both of you .
i talked to sarah , you know .
she said that you guys met up when she was in town .
no .
i talked to her about three hours ago .
she called , while you were in the air , from la .
she's freaking out .
everything's fine .
i know what you're going through .
it's a scary leap .
the trick is you have to let go of your fears ... ... and just kind of go for it .
believe me , the worst thing you can do is lose the right girl ... ... because of a fear of commitment .
the worst thing you can do is marry the wrong girl ... ... because of a fear of loneliness .
i can't wait for you to meet her .
i've told her all about you .
you have?
yeah .
i told her about all you guys .
i had to warn her .
even my name?
you didn't mention my name .
no , of course not your name .
we refer to you all by your general nature , like the indians .
mike is " fucks whatever moves .
you're " dances around major life decisions .
what'd she say , when you mentioned my name?
what is wrong with you?
i'm sorry .
what would she possibly say about ...
oh , there she is .
this is david .
david , this is julie .
so nice to finally meet you .
i feel like i already know you .
i feel the same way .
isn't she beautiful?
you look like i did first time i laid eyes on her .
i just knew right away .
it hit me like a blinding realisation , like ...
pure truth .
was he always this sappy?
since i met you , baby .
will you order me a drink?
i'm going to go to the ladies 'room .
excuse me .
now you know , buddy .
now you understand .
that's it .
this guy jeff works at tyler's firm ... ... knew my roommate , and they hooked us up .
end of story .
that's ...
wow , what a story .
the important thing is that you ended up together?
yeah .
i mean , think of all the people you've met in your lives .
all the paths taken , not taken .
you can probably trace back to your very first romantic memory .
lf you tried .
oh , yeah .
fifth grade drama class .
miss liska had us lie on the ground and pretend we were driftwood .
and then as she walked around the " beach " ... ... she would step over us ...
we get it .
that's nice , sweetie .
what about you , julie?
oh , no .
the airport guy?
the airport guy?
what about the airport guy?
tell me about this airport guy .
it's okay , honey .
he's a friend .
okay .
i was travelling with my family once .
we were in an airport ... ... and this guy came up to me from out of nowhere .
and he started , saying all these strange things to me ... ... about how he felt something when he saw me ... ... and he wondered if i felt it , too .
i didn't know what to say , so i just kind of smiled at him .
he gave me his address ... ... and asked , if i felt the same i should write him .
and as he walked away , i had this frozen grin on my face .
i didn't want to agitate him or anything .
i was terrified that he was going to hurt me .
can you believe that?
how old were you , honey?
eleven .
eleven years old .
if that son of a bitch were here right now ...
but you wrote him !
i mean , did you ever write him?
no .
of course not .
honey , do you want me to finish the story for you?
there's more?
yeah .
no , it's okay .
i can do this .
so as soon as the guy was gone i threw the address away .
but what i didn't know at the time was that my little sister katie ... ... who was two years younger than me ... ... saw everything .
she wanted to be like me .
she worshipped me and she started writing this creep , as me .
she even sent him my picture .
then , of course , when he wrote back ... ... weird stuff about how he wanted to run away with her ... ... and make babies .
can you imagine that?
make babies?
and this is before the internet .
what a sicko .
i'm sorry , honey .
are you all right?
but ... ... did you ever find out who this guy was?
my parents did .
sort of .
they overheard katie bragging to me about her boyfriend .
she had mentioned it before ... ... so we just assumed it was this imaginary play friend or something .
but when she started telling me about how he'd promised to run away with her ... ... and make love to her ...
under the stars . ... they stepped in .
she was only nine .
so my dad called the authorities ... ... gave them the guy's address ... ... and , as was his style , told us to forget the whole thing !
it wasn't until years later ... ... that i realized the guy thought he was writing me .
and then i pieced it together , and i remembered the airport incident .
but i never told anyone .
i have to go .
are you all right?
where are you going?
i have to ...
thank you for the ...
congratulations with ...
good bye .
i'd seen the light .
it was this glaringly obvious , blind realisation ... ... like pure truth .
and it was not about anyone in particular , but about people in general .
i realised at that moment there is no such thing as " the one .
it's more of a mind boggling , whole hell of a lot of potential ones .
and while that should be comforting , it was actually pretty terrifying .
we'd all like to kick back and wait for some magical force ... ... to show us who we should spend the rest of our lives with .
but the truth is ... ... there isn't a lightning bolt to slap you on the ass ... ... and tell you to pick this person over all others .
if anything , it's like the rain .
rain falls all the time .
sometimes you're prepared for it , sometimes you're not .
depending where you are when it hits you either get caught or you don't .
in fact , most of us usually try like hell to avoid it .
you might miss the bus .
you might catch the bus .
maybe you remembered your umbrella , maybe you didn't .
no big signs .
just random , torrential bursts of opportunity .
and that's the most fate can do .
the rest is up to us .
and now , by the power vested in me ... ... i now pronounce you husband and wife .
you may kiss the bride .
so the eternal bachelor was the first one to go .
i don't think i'll ever understand men .
you look amazing .
thanks .
i'm very happy for you .
i mean it .
thanks .
i had a tough time for those first few months .
it was really hard .
but then i had to take nicole to the emergency room ... ... to get her stomach pumped again and there he was .
our eyes just met ... ... and it was like this indescribable feeling like ...
i get it .
not that happy yet .
it's terrific you found someone who deserves you .
but i'd be lying if i said i didn't miss our friendship .
okay .
i think it's time to stir things up on the dance floor .
join me?
i think i'll pass .
i didn't bring any singles with me .
joke .
please remember there are impressionable children out there .
let's keep it pg 13 .
no problem .
hand me that dildo , will you?
amy .
yeah .
haven't seen her since college .
she's great .
you two ...
no .
we're just friends .
i saw that goofy looking bastard that sarah's with .
that guy , he's like missing a chromosome or something .
what a freak .
we both know he's an attractive guy .
but , thank you for trying .
i bet he's no brain surgeon .
shit .
really?
there you are .
baby , you remember david .
you met him at the restaurant a couple months ago .
glad you didn't have to rush out early today .
it was a beautiful ceremony .
thank you .
i'm just glad my little sister got to catch the end .
katie showed up?
honey , that's great .
i didn't think she would make it .
what happened?
your sister is here?
yeah .
but she doesn't like weddings .
she never got over that airport guy .
the paedophile , the sicko .
asshole .
honey , settle down .
you know i should really introduce you two .
you would totally hit it off .
what a great idea .
why don't you go get her?
no , no .
that's not necessary .
virgin .
hot .
i think i see her .
stay here .
i'll be right back .
what's the matter?
you look like you did the night at the restaurant when you ...
i have to go . ... bolted .
lightning taxi .
hi .
i need a cab .
fast .
ladies and gentlemen at this time , mike hanson , the best man ... ... would like to make a toast to julie and tyler .
all right , thank you .
thank you .
many of you don't know me ... ... but i had the pleasure of being ... ... tyler's roommate in our fraternity house at school .
yeah , you were !
phi lamb !
who's my boy , mikey?
you're my boy !
and today i have the privilege ... ... of being the best man in his wedding .
suffice it to say , i was shocked to hear that he was getting married .
but over time as i talked to him on the phone ... ... i began to understand .
we used to do everything together .
we were joined at the hip .
it struck me that what these two people were doing ... ... was giving themselves in to ... ... a blinding realisation .
pure truth .
they stood before everyone they knew and confessed their new found selves .
i don't know , but witnessing such strength ... ... and courage in my friends ... ... inspires me in a way which i can barely put into words .
you see , while many of you don't know me ... ... the rest of you only think you do .
the truth is you're about to meet mike hanson for the first time .
my name is mike hanson ... ... and i'm a raging homosexual .
thank you .
i didn't really know him that well .
and let's give it up to the newlyweds .
congrats , guys .
hit it .
why does everybody keep trying to set me up?
they're never him .
katie , please come out and meet him .
you look amazing .
all right , let's go meet this guy .
ladies !
there you are !
katie , i'm so glad that you could make it .
thank you .
we have to go .
the limo is here .
wait .
have you seen david?
no .
i think he left with mike and amy because i haven't seen them , either .
but you know what?
we should forget about them .
i'm gonna meet you up front .
we really have to go .
it's okay .
you just go .
no .
you're coming with us .
no .
it's your day .
don't worry about me .
i'll be fine .
are you sure?
positive .
just go , all right?
love you .
love you , too .
so , i don't mean to belittle your big announcement ... ... but come on , mike , you never even worked retail .
it makes sense .
all my life i've treated women like dirt , never letting them get too close ... ... just using and cruising .
that doesn't make you a homosexual .
it makes you an asshole .
excuse me , are you waiting for someone?
no , i'm not waiting , i'm not waiting .
wait a minute , that's my cab !
that's my ...
these insolent swine !
they call you and they tell you to come right away .
big hurry !
and you come , they're not there .
and i feel like ...
how do you say , " assholes "?
yeah , i know the feeling .
you know the feeling?
do you know the feeling?
so it was nice wedding , yes?
no , not again !
my god !
no , no .
please get up .
are you all right?
it's you .
i have been looking everywhere for you .
what took you so long?
i feel all tingly inside .
i know .
so do i.
no , in a scary way .
right .
we should get you to a hospital .
what are you doing?
you said you were gay .
yeah , and your point is?
