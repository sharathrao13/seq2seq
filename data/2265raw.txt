there are six hijackers armed with handguns and knives ... ... in controi of that plane .
they've kiiled one hostage and are threatening to kiii the others ... ... unless they get a pilot and fuei within the hour .
there'ii be swat officers disguised as hostages .
other swat officers wiii be playing the roles of terrorists .
and they wiii be trying to kiii you .
staff sergeants wiii be grading us .
couldn't give us the bus , huh , hondo?
they always give us the bus .
fuiler's reaily got it in for us .
you think?
another thing .
there are two dynamic entry points .
one here beneath the front ianding gear ... ... one back here by the baggage compartment .
i'm sure fuiler's got surprises at both those entrances .
we get bogged down anywhere , we fail .
any ideas?
there's another way in , hondo .
there's an elevator shaft where they bring in the service carts .
and there's a mechanic's access right here .
man , that's gonna be tight as heil .
yeah .
how many men can we fit in there?
men?
none .
aii right .
work this out .
get in there and break fuiler's heart .
okay .
