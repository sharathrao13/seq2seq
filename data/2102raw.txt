what's your pleasure , mr. cotton?
the box .
take it , it's yours .
it always was .
it's gotta be one of these .
i'm going to freeze to death .
okay , okay .
well , maybe somebody changed the lock .
well , that's crazy .
who's gonna change this lock?
well , i don't know .
it was just a suggestion .
ah !
success .
voila !
well , this is it .
the old homestead .
oh !
it smells damp .
well , it's ... uh ... been empty for a while , hasn't it?
but we'll soon warm it up . and get it feeling like a home .
how long since you were here?
oh , the better part of ten years .
i wanted to sell it after the old lady died , but i couldn't get frank to agree .
i guess he needed a hideout or something .
would you look at this?
and don't worry , this stuff means nothing to me .
it all goes .
i thought half of it was your brother's .
i've never known him to kick cash out of bed .
besides ... he's probably behind bars some place .
you know ...
we'll have to let kirsty see this place before we do a thing to it .
she'll love it .
you really want to move in here?
you don't like it?
i suppose it's better than brooklyn .
oh , don't start , julia .
don't start what?
look ... we can make it work here .
now i've got a terrific job , you're back in your own turf .
we can be happy .
all right , all right .
so what's the argument?
no argument .
oh , christ !
but honey ...
shit !
larry !
larry !
where are you?
in here .
squatters?
frank .
he's here?
well , he's been here .
i mean , there's stuff in the kitchen you wouldn't believe .
he's obviously made one of his famous getaways .
what the hell is that?
who is this?
dad?
kirsty !
i got through .
darling , where are you?
i found a room .
you what?
i said , i found a room .
wait , i thought you were going to stay with us for awhile ..
dad ...
well , you'd like this house .
you'd like my room .
i'd really like you to see this house .
it's something else .
maybe in the next couple of days .
i gotta find myself a job .
what for , sweetie?
look , you've already made the gesture , there's no need ...
dad , this isn't a gesture .
this is something i need to do .
come on and trust me a little , okay?
call me tomorrow .
i will .
i'll see you .
bye , dad .
so?
why not .
great .
we'll move in on sunday .
listen look out for the molding on the way through here .
all right .
all right .
are you all right back there?
yeah , yeah .
all right , okay .
now just take it straight upstairs .
don't worry , it'll get through .
all right .
hey , you got my arm !
all right , all right .
watch it .
let's take five , guys .
how's things in there?
looks like a bomb dropped .
you got any beer?
there's some in the fridge .
oh , well ... why don't i get it?
i got nothing better to do .
excuse me .
my lucky day .
hi .
you wanna buy a bed?

she's upstairs .
look , be gentle with her , okay?
she hates moving .
surprise .
kirsty !
okay , all right , i'll be nice .
get on with grand work and
i'll make myself some coffee .
that's a great idea .
there's the kitchen .
okay .

she's got her mother's looks .
her mother's dead .
oh , shit !

i'm sorry .
of course .
you're very welcome .
yeah .
well , that's nice to know .
do you have a towel?
have you got a towel?
kirsty .
there's one in the bathroom .
oh , by the way , did daddy tell you i got a room?
it's not that big , but it's okay .
julia?
julia?
what shall we drink to?
wedded bliss?
i'm very happy .
i'm sure you are .
are you going to let me kiss the bride?
what about larry?

now push it to me as i pull .
it's never enough .
julia .

here .
oh , is it deep?
i don't know .
i haven't looked .
you know me and blood .
i'm going to faint .
you're not going to faint .
oh , shit !
look , let me see it .
shit !
oh , it's going to need stitches .
oh , god , i'm going to throw up .
you're not going to throw up .
just take it easy , take it easy .
i'm going to throw up .
it's going to be all right .
let's go downstairs .?
okay?
so stupid !
what happened?
it was just an accident .
he's all right .
look , will you drive?
he needs stitches .
yeah , sure .
the keys are in the kitchen .
so stupid .
it's all right .
no , no , i am not kidding .
listen , i'm going to pass out !
he says , " no , of course you're not , old boy " .
the next thing i know , i'm on the floor , and he's standing there like he's the one that needs help .
he's probably afraid you'd sue him .
i should do it !
bill , i should do it , you know all about that stuff .
i'll call you tomorrow .
we'll sue his ass .
doctors !
that's right , honey .
and what's my darling daughter drinking?
i don't remember .
oh , julia , you want some more wine?
uh , no more for me , thanks .?
okay .
stop .
i won't be able to stand up .
so lie down .
would you all excuse me .
i think i'm going to go to bed .
are your all right , darling?
we ought to be making a move , too .
but , bill !
absolu ... absolutely not !
this is the night of the paper hats here .
we're celebrating ... something .
so sit down .
good night ..
you'll have to come to us next .
yeah , real soon .
i'm glad you're back .

kirsty?
i thought i'd lost you .
no , i'm here .
good night .
why don't you stay at larry's house?
there's plenty of room .
oh , yeah , there's room .
and there's julia .
ah !
i see .
she's like you , she's so damn polite .
oh , yeah?
meaning what?
oh , i don't know , she's uptight and frigid .
i beg your pardon .
see , there you go .
i beg your pardon .
hey , we're not al frigid .
oh , no?
oh , no .
oh , no?
oh , no .
it's not what i heard ..
you must have been speaking to all the wrong people .
anything?
anything .
you'll do it?
yes , i will ..
kirsty?
kirsty?
kirsty !
you all right?
yeah .
i don't know ...
i was dreaming .
daddy !
hello .
i'm all right , honey .
i just wanted to make sure you're okay .
never better .
now you sleep well , okay?
yeah .
i love you , sweetie i love you too , daddy .
bye .
who was it?
she had a bad dream .
who?
kirsty .
kirsty .
not much fun , is it?
what?
drinking alone .
not much .
i thought maybe ... well ... as we're both on our own , maybe we could have a drink together .
why not .
you know , it's not often that ... you know .
there's a first time for everything .
that's right , yeah .
i suppose that's right .
would you ... like a drink?
oh , no , no , no .
i'm well over my limit .?
you know , it's funny , but ...
i ...
i feel like i've known you for years , you know .
what's the matter?
it's what you brought me here for , isn't it?
well , isn't it?
i suppose so , yes .
so , what's your problem?
let's get on with it .
you're not going to change your fucking mind , are you?
i'm sorry .
let's go upstairs .
okay , okay , sorry , okay?
okay .
right .
this isn't the bedroom ..
no .
so , what's going on?
we don't need a bed , do we?
well , no , i suppose not .
i've always preferred the floor .
oh , first time for everything , eh?
why don't you take your jacket off?
yeah , why don't i?
why don't you do the same thing?
maybe i will .
you're very beautiful .
am i?
oh , you know you are .
the loveliest woman i've ever seen .
oh , christ !
what's wrong?
one minute .
too much drink .
have to empty the old bladder .
did you lock this?
please !
please !
don't look at me .
jesus christ !
see? .
it's making me whole again .
every drop of blood you spill puts more flesh on my bones .
and we both want that , don't we?
good . !
come here .
come here , damn you , i want to touch you .
come to daddy .
julia !
julia !
come out , come out , wherever you are .
julia , i was calling for you .
didn't you hear?
are you in there?
do you want a cookie , little girl?
i'm feeling sick .
oh , babe .
is there anything i can get you?
maybe a brandy .
it's coming right up .
i'll be down in a minute .
okay .
there's no hurry .
frank?
i'm hurting .
hurting?
my nerves are beginning to work again .
good .
one more .
maybe two .
not again .
to heal me completely .
then we can be away from here before they start to follow .
who?
the cenobites .
it's only a matter of time before they find i've slipped them .
i must get away from here .
julia?
are you all right?
just a moment .
put on some music , will you , babe?
yeah , sure .
poor larry , obedient as ever .
keep your voice down .
you don't want " babe " to hear .
you're hurting .
you won't cheat me , will you?
you'll stay with me .
help me .
then we can be together the way we were before .
we belong to each other now .
for better , for worse .
make love , only real .
i'm sorry , i'm new here .
you're gonna have to wait .
could you not do that , please !
where's the manager?
that's a problem too , because he's out to lunch right now .
i want to see somebody in charge .
then you'll have to wait .
excuse me .
well , excuse me !
what are you doing?
you give those back .
oh , my god !
get out !
get out of here ! .
hi .
hi .
just came by to see what you're doing after work .
what's wrong?
something weird .
what?
nothing .
you're sure we're not going to be interrupted?
quite sure .
only i ...
i like to be careful .
i can taste that .
it's a long time since i tasted anything .
you promised me an explanation .
this is it .
let me see .
no , don't touch it !
it's dangerous .
it opens doors ..
what kind of doors?
doors to the pleasures of heaven or hell .
i didn't care which .
i thought i'd gone to the limits .
i hadn't .
the cenobites gave me an experience beyond the limits .
pain and pleasure .
indivisible .
they won't get me back .
i'm going to leave and you're going to help me , yes?
yes .
they'll never find us .
not in the whole wide world .
boom boom " has got him now !
boom boom " has got him .
i thought this kind of stuff made you sick .
i've seen worse .
are you all right?
fine .
we can watch something else if you feel like ...
get him !
get him !
what was that? .
i think i left a window open upstairs .
i'll go see .
no .
larry ,
it was nothing .
larry !
what's the matter with you , anyway?
it's ... it's just that i hate the thunder .
i'm here .
you're safe .
you're trembling .
there's nothing to be afraid of .
look .
i really should check it out .
don't go up there , please .
look , we'll both go up .
come on .
larry , please !
don't worry about it .
come on .
don't .
it's okay .
it's okay .
it's probably a rat .
i told you .
there's nothing to be afraid of .
let's go downstairs .
i'll make it better?
no , this is enough light .
come on , let's go inside .
oh , yes .
yes , yes .
yes .
no !
no !
no , please , don't do it , please !
i can't bear it , please !
please , no !
please !
please , don't !
i can't bear it , please !
no !
look at you !
i don't understand you !
i mean , one minute ... you're all over me , and the next ...
i just don't understand you .
i don't know .
maybe we shouldn't have come back .
i mean , brooklyn certainly wasn't any worse than this .
look , you love her , so there must be something worth loving .
i wish it were that simple .
i got a real problem here , kiddo .
she doesn't even want to leave the house .
really?
it's like she's ... waiting for something .
what?
i don't know .
i don't know .
it's way beyond me ..
look , could you ... would you ... stop by sometime?
try to make friends?
sure .
who knows , maybe all she needs is somebody to talk to .
you can't love him .
you know i don't .
so , where's the harm?
i said , no !
then find me somebody else , before they come looking .
now !
i ...
i get lonely sometimes .
everybody does .
come in .
what is this?
a game?
jesus christ !
oh , christ !
help me !
oh , no !
get out of here !
please , don't let him kill me .
no , please !
no !
kirsty , it's frank , it's uncle frank .
no !
you remember .
no !
come to daddy .
get the fuck off me !
you've grown .
you're beautiful .
don't ... don't touch me !
don't touch me or so help me i'll ...
i'll ...
what'll you do?
what can you do?
there's nothing to be afraid of .
i bet you make your daddy so proud , don't you?
beautiful .
this isn't happening .
i used to tell myself that .
used to try and pretend i was dreaming all the pain .
but don't you kid yourself .
some things have to be endured .
and that's what makes the pleasures so sweet .
no !
give me that !
no !
give it to me !
you want it?
one last time , give me that box .
you want it?
give me the box !
you wanna fucking have it?
no ... !
kirsty .
come to daddy .
it's frank .
you remember .
it's uncle frank .
are you all right?
you're awake !
good girl .
what happened?
i'll get the doctor .
wait a minute .
how did i get here?
i won't be a moment .
please , get back into bed .
i have to call my father .
that's easily arranged , but first , back into bed .
it's important .
it really is ...
first things first .
we'll get you a telephone after we've talked .
what about this?
ring any bells?
you were hanging on to it like grim death .
i don't remember .
well , the police will want to speak to you .
you know that .
oh , christ !
in the meantime , maybe this will jog your memory .
shit !
the box .
you opened it .
we came .
it's just a puzzle box !
oh , no .
it is a means to summon us .
who are you?
explorers in the further regions of experience .
demons to some .
angels to others .
i was a mistake !
i didn't mean to open it !
it was a mistake !
you can all go to hell !
we can't .
not alone .
you solved the box .
we came .
now you must come with us .
taste our pleasures .
please ... go away and leave me alone !
oh , no tears , please .
it's a waste of good suffering .
wait !
wait !
wait !
wait , please , wait !
no time for argument .
you've done it before , right?
many , may times .
to a man called frank cotton?
oh , yes .
he escaped you .
nobody escapes us .
he did .
i've seen him .
i've seen him .
impossible !
he's alive !
supposing he had escaped us .
what has that to do with you?
i can ...
i can lead you to him .
and you can take him back instead of me .
perhaps we prefer you .
i want to hear him confess himself , then maybe ... maybe ...
but if you cheat us .
we'll tear your soul apart .
she'll tell them everything ..
i don't think so .
she'll want to warn larry first .
that's probably her now .
or the police .
it doesn't make any difference .
don't you care?
what i care about is a new skin .
maybe we should just leave .
like this?
look at me .
we can't just stay here .
my brother will be home soon .
what is it?
i don't know where to begin .
what are you talking about?
it's best you see for yourself .
i left her here safe and sound .
i even locked the door .
well , she's not here now .
i'll start looking for her .
maybe she's gone back to ... to her father's house ..
daddy?
daddy , it's me , kirsty !
let me in !
daddy , let me in !
kirsty?
it's very late .
where is my dad?
what's the matter?
i want to see my father !
of course .
where is he?
where is he? !
daddy?
daddy? ,
daddy , you're all right .
sure i am .
sure i am .
you're okay !
it's okay .
i was so afraid that something happened to you .
i know , i know .
i need to talk to you .
yes?
it's okay , baby , julia told me everything .
oh , no , see ... your brother frank is upstairs .
he's upstairs and he's trying to kill you .
he's trying to kill you .
no , wait , wait , wait .
whatever did frank was unspeakable .
unspeakable .
but believe me , it's finished with now .
why is it finished?
he's gone .
what's gone mean?
he's dead , kirsty .
he was insane , baby .
a mad dog .
had to put him out of his misery .
jesus , what a scene .
and , when i'm feeling better ,
i'll go to the police and try to make them understand .
god knows ...
i don't really understand myself .
did he hurt you , baby?
no , i'm okay .
he's better off dead .
poor frank .
i don't believe this .
i don't believe this .
believe it .
i need to see him .
no , you don't .
yes , i do !
yes !
show her .
we want the man who did this .
no .
no , that wasn't the deal .
he's my father and you can't have him .
no !
move !
kirsty ...
move !
what's the matter?
there's no time .
no way , no way , i told you all that's over with now .
no , it's not !
we've got to get out of here !
no , stay with us .
we can all be happy here .
no .
come to daddy .
oh , my god !
come ... to daddy .
ah !
frank !
well ...
so much for the cat and mouse shit !
no !
not me !
it's nothing personal , baby .
where are you , beautiful?
come out , come out , wherever you are .
oh , my god !
daddy .
daddy !
no , don't mourn him .
he was dead long before we ever touched him .
bastard !
now , hush now .
everything's all right .
frank is here .
bastard !
your dear old uncle frank .
what the hell is that?
frank .
no !
we have to hear it from your own lips .
this isn't for your eyes .
you set me up , bitch !
jesus wept .
not leaving us so soon , are you?
we have such sights to show you .
oh , shit !
no !
don't do that !
go to hell !
kirsty !
kirsty !
no .
steve !
oh , shit !
oh , kirsty !
thank god you're okay .
let's get the hell out of here !
now !
oh , no !
oh , god !
no !
open !
steve !
no !
what's your pleasure , sir?
