... the son of the devil .
well , hold on , it says here ...
beeman?
yeah .
sorry , i'm ...
i'm sorry , no , i'm right here .
it says mammon has no patience for his father's rule ... ... and yearns to forge his own kingdom of fire and blood .
yeah .
mammon would be the last demon ... ... we'd ever want crossing over to our plane .
no , wait , wait , wait .
i'm reading .
seems to be a loophole .
always a catch .
it says first mammon would have to possess a very , very powerful psychic .
isabel .
but that wouldn't be enough .
to cross over , mammon would need divine assistance .
to cross over , mammon would need the help of god .
the help of god?
it says ...
beeman?
john , look ... ... i know you've never had much faith , you've never had much reason to ... ... but that doesn't mean that we don't have faith ... ... in you .
beeman?
beeman?
drive .
fast .
beeman !
sulfur .
beeman !
beeman !
wasn't just isabel .
i used to see things too .
but ... ... you already knew that , didn't you?
go home , angela .
i need to understand .
you don't wanna know what's out there , trust me .
i'm stronger than isabel .
your sister embraced her gift , you denied yours .
denial is a better idea .
it's why you're still alive .
stick with me , that will change .
i don't need another ghost following me .
john , they killed my sister .
i'd trade places with her if i could .
i used to pretend that i didn't .
that i didn't see things .
and ... ... by the time we were 10 , they started forcing her to take ... ... antipsychotics ... ... and have treatments .
they would come for her ... ... and she'd look at me , and she'd say to me , " tell them .
why don't you tell them , angie , that you can see them too?
but i lied .
i don't see anything .
until one day ... ... i finally stopped seeing .
i abandoned her , john .
i left her all alone .
i need to see what she saw .
please .
you do this , there's no turning back .
you see them ... ... they see you .
understand?
yeah .
sure .
so do i have to take the rest of my clothes off , or can i leave them on?
john?
i'm thinking .
john?
on is fine .
so why water?
it's a universal conduit .
lubricates the transition from one plane to another .
now ask me if there's water in hell .
is there water in hell?
sit .
normally , only a portion of the body has to be suspended ... ... but you wanted the crash course .
yeah , i wanted the crash course .
so ...
so , what's gonna happen?
lie down .
what do you mean lie down?
you have to be fully submerged .
for how long?
as long as it takes .
take a deep one .
oh , god .
oh , god , all those people .
oh , isabel .
i've always known .
i've always known where they are .
i've always known where to find them ... ... where to aim and where to duck ... ... and i've always known where they were .
i've always known that it wasn't luck .
always known that it wasn't luck .
i've always known ...
i've always known that i could see .
i've always known that i could see .
angela .
someone was here .
it was his .
rolling .
not a ball .
something smaller .
shiny .
balthazar .
sorry .
can you just kill him?
what about the balance?
half breed tipped the scales when he started killing my friends .
i'm just adding some counterweight .
john , i really want ...
think of it as a bulletproof vest .
i'm coming with you .
you're staying in the car .
fire?
i was born of this .
how's mammon crossing over , you half breed piece of shit?
that's better .
au naturel .
stay in the car .
wait here .
men .
don't fight it , johnny boy .
enjoy it .
we'll see you very soon .
not really , no .
you can't cheat it this time .
you're going back to hell .
true .
but you're not .
what are you doing?
i'm reading you your last rites .
spare me your remedial incantations .
you do know what it is to truly be forgiven?
to be welcomed into the kingdom of god .
demon in heaven .
i'd love to be a fly on that wall .
you're not a priest .
you have no power .
just tell me how mammon is crossing over ... ... and you can go back to your shithole .
okay , bally , enjoy it .
may god have mercy on you and grant you the pardon of all your sins .
whose soever sins you remit on earth , they are remitted unto them in heaven .
how?
how's he doing it?
no .
no , i can't .
grant your child entry into thy kingdom ... ... in the name of the father and the son and the holy spirit .
amen !
the blood of god .
he found it .
whatever killed the son of god ... ... will give birth to the son of the devil .
by the way ... ... you have to ask for absolution to be forgiven ... ... asshole .
my work here is done .
what are you laughing at?
she was my only mission ... ... and you brought her right to us .
so does this walking fast mean you've found something?
jesus didn't die from being nailed to a cross .
he was killed by a soldier's spear .
the spear of destiny .
i'm a catholic , john .
i know the crucifixion story .
i drew out the sister as you asked .
she's been made flush and ready .
so much power .
now , if you grant me my resurrection , i shall serve .
wait .
but i did as we agreed .
no .
please .
no !
beeman said mammon needed divine assistance to cross over .
how's the blood of god's only son?
the stains on the spear .
yeah .
so he gets the spear .
he still has to locate a powerful psychic .
not really .
twins .
where's the amulet?
i don't know , i must have left it in the ...
what's wrong?
i don't know , i just feel ...
bird on a ladder .
sorry .
wait here .
yeah .
who's a rat in a dress now , huh , bitch?
have you lost what little mind you have?
don't .
i need to use the chair .
i offer no aid to one side or the other .
the balance .
screw the balance .
you dare?
in my house?
is this neutral?
bullshit .
you're the only one still playing by the rules , midnite .
and while you've been imitating switzerland , people are dying .
hennessy , beeman , they were your friends once too , remember?
i need your help !
consider it a last request .
you play a dangerous game .
two hundred dollar shirt , by the way .
that little shit has been trying to climb out of his father's shadow for eons .
i'd hate to think what he would do to this world if he ever broke through .
forgot how big it was .
two hundred souls passed through this wood and steel at sing sing .
yeah .
which way's east?
how many years since you've surfed?
like riding a bike .
no , not really .
tell me this isn't about the girl .
definitely mostly not about the girl .
cold .
little flavor?
sure about this?
no .
midnite !
any luck?
that's a word for it .
holy shit .
you're papa midnite , aren't you?
and how exactly do you intend on getting close enough to use these?
well , they did not leave her unguarded .
half breeds are most vulnerable ... ... when their outer skin is breached by holy water .
certain objects , most notably either of the two crosses of isteria ... ... have been used by even the unordained to bless ... ... commonly occurring waters ... ... even rain .
maybe if ...
there's no use sitting on the bench if you're not ready to play , right?
you wouldn't have one of those enchanted crosses here in a cabinet ... ... maybe we could take with us?
look , john , no offense , i just don't think that it's a great idea , you know ... ... you going on a solo mission to save the world .
that's my vote .
i don't know what pops thinks , but that's ...
take him , john .
kill him after .
if you get back , see me about membership .
maybe .
okay .
i will .
what are you doing?
praying .
praying .
okay .
come on .
half breeds , right?
a birth like this , they're definitely gonna be guarding her , right?
definitely .
yeah .
we can get through them .
i mean , that cross has gotta work , right?
right?
it's not always like it is in the books .
what is that?
hellspeak .
you know what to do .
i'm okay .
sure .
one last show .
hi .
my name's john .
you are in violation of the balance .
leave immediately ... ... or i will deport you .
all of you .
go to hell .
holy water?
angela .
john?
john .
shit .
pull !
angela .
angela , what is it?
get it out .
get it out .
get it ...
oh , my god .
not bad , kid .
not bad . " you hear that?
you know why that is?
it's because this is kramer .
chas kramer , ass ...
chas .
you're right , john .
it's not like the books .
no ... ... it isn't .
into the light , i command thee .
into the light , i command thee .
into the light , i command thee .
into the light , i command thee .
your ego is astounding .
gabriel .
figures .
and the wicked shall inherit the earth .
you judging me now , john?
betrayal , murder , genocide , call me provincial .
i am simply seeking to inspire mankind to all that was intended .
by handing earth over to the son of the devil?
help me here .
you're handed this precious gift , right?
each one of you granted redemption from the creator .
murderers , rapists and molesters ... ... all of you , you just have to repent ... ... and god takes you into his bosom .
in all the worlds in all the universe ... ... no other creature can make such a boast , save man .
it's not fair .
if sweet , sweet god loves you so ... ... then i'll make you worthy of his love .
i've been watching you for a long time .
it's only in the face of horror that you truly find your nobler selves .
and you can be so noble .
so ... ... i'll bring you pain .
i'll bring you horror .
so that you may rise above it .
so that those of you who survive this reign of hell on earth ... ... will be worthy of god's love .
gabriel ... ... you're insane .
the road to salvation begins tonight .
right now .
i know i'm not one of your favorites .
i'm not even welcome in your house .
but i could use a little attention .
please .
come forth .
hurry .
mammon ... ... son of satan ... ... i unleash you unto this world .
lu .
what took you so long?
hello , john .
john , hello .
you're the one soul ... ... i would come up here to collect myself .
so i've heard .
you mind?
oh , go ...
go right ahead .
i've got stock .
coffin nail .
very fitting , john .
you know , when you cut too deep , you cut the tendons ... ... finger movement goes out the window .
let me help you .
see?
sonny ... ... i've got a whole theme park full of red delights for you .
well , aren't you a peach .
i didn't think you would make the same mistake twice .
and you didn't ... ... did you?
so how's the family?
family's doing just fine .
busy , busy , busy .
need a vacation .
word is that kid of yours is a chip off the old block .
well , one does what one can .
he's in the other room .
boys will be boys .
with gabriel .
no accounting for taste , really .
they have the spear of destiny .
they have the spear of destiny .
or is it another one of your cons?
go look for yourself .
you've waited 20 years for me , lu ... ... what's another 20 seconds?
lucifer .
this world is mine .
in time .
you , best of all of us , gabriel ... ... should understand ambition .
son of perdition .
little horn .
most unclean .
i do miss the old names .
time to go home , son .
i will smite thee ... ... in his honor .
looks like somebody doesn't have your back anymore .
father?
so .
so .
yeah , what do you want?
an extension?
the sister ... ... isabel .
what about her?
let her go home .
you're willing to give up your life so she can go to heaven?
fine .
it's done .
time to go , john .
yeah .
the sacrifice .
no .
this one belongs to me .
no .
you will live , john constantine .
you will live .
so you will have ... ... the chance to prove ... ... that your soul truly belongs in hell .
oh , you will live .
you will live .
thank you .
no problem .
human .
you don't deserve to be human .
do you want revenge?
is that what you're thinking right now?
do it .
do it .
seek revenge .
end my life .
go on .
be the hand of god .
it's your choice .
it's always been your choice .
yeah .
that's called pain .
get used to it .
you could've shot me , john !
you chose a higher path !
look how well you're doing !
nice spot .
i have something for you .
something tells me you're not a flowers kind of guy .
oh , how thoughtful .
john ... ... why are you giving me this?
rules .
hide it .
somewhere no one will ever be able to find it .
not even me .
always a catch .
yeah .
so .
i've got some cleaning up to do .
i'll ... ... see you around .
i'd like that .
i guess there's a plan for all of us .
i had to die ... ... twice ... ... just to figure that out .
like the book says , he works his work in mysterious ways .
some people like it ... ... some people don't .
you did good , kid .
