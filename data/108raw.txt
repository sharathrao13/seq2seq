oh , yeah , we got this puppy .
this was a good idea .
elliot looks a little green .
do i look like a beautiful blond with big tits and an ass ... that tastes like french vanilla ice cream?
what?
i said , do i look like a beautiful blond with big tits and an ass ... that tastes like french vanilla ice cream?
no .
no .
then why are you telling me this bullshit?
what , do you want to fuck me?
clarence .
he's sick , man .
let me handle this , all right?
look .
you know what?
just get it straight .
lee is not into taking risks , okay?
he's got a couple of guys , he's been dealing with them for years .
they're reliable , they're dependable , and they're safe .
riddle me this , batman " .
if you're so much in love , what are you doing here?
i'm sure you've got better things to do than hanging around on a roller coaster .
your guy is interested because with that much shit ... he could play joe fucking hollywood until the wheels come off .
he can sell it , he can snort it ... he can play santa claus with it .
at the price he's paying he'll be able to throw it around .
he'll be everybody's best friend .
i'm not putting him down .
it's his money , let him do what he wants .
but don't expect us to hang around ... waiting for you guys to grow some guts , all right?
jesus .
yeah , hello .
hi , lee .
elliot , it's sunday .
can you tell me why i'm talking to you on sunday?
don't i see enough of you all week?
i'm with that party that you wanted me to get together with , lee .
you know who i'm talking about?
i don't believe this .
why are you talking to me ... on my phone about that?
well , because i'm standing with the guy , and he insists on talking to you .
what , are you out of your fucking mind?
he said that if i didn't get you on the phone , that he would leave ....
hello , lee , it's clarence .
at last , we speak .
first , i want to tell you i'm a big fan of yours .
that's why i want to open dr. zhivago in la .
and i need you and your abilities to distribute it .
i don't know .
dr. zhivago is a pretty big movie .
the biggest movie you've dealt with .
we're talking a lot of film here .
a man would be an idiot not to be a little cautious about a movie like that .
and , lee , you're no idiot .
i'm not saying i'm not interested .
it's just , being a distributor is not what i do .
i'm a movie producer , you know?
i'm here to make good movies , nothing more ... and nothing , well , maybe less , sometimes .
hey !
choose a fucking lane !
not you , just an idiot ...
don't give me the finger !
i'll fucking have you killed !
so , bottom line is i'm not paramount .
you know what i'm saying?
i got a select few distributors .
i buy their little movies and i accomplish what i want and i get out of there .
very business like , very easy , and very little risk .
we're talking dr. zhivago .
it'll be packing them in .
for a year ... two years you won't have to deal with anybody else's movie but mine .
nobody's but yours .
well , what's the rush here?
i want to be able to announce the deal at cannes .
if i had time for a courtship , i would .
i'd take you out , hold your hand , kiss your cheek .
but i'm not in that position .
i need to know right now if you and i are in bed together or not .
if you want my movie , you must come to terms ... with your fear and desire .
fear and desire , huh , clarence?
don't you know that my films have grossed more than $2 . 8 billion?
let me talk to elliot .
you want to talk to elliot?
let me talk to elliot .
elliot .
he wants to talk to you .
hi , lee .
elliot , where do you know this guy from?
he's a friend of dick's , remember?
who the fuck is dick?
you want me to suck his dick?
who the fuck is dick?
oh , who the fuck is dick?
yeah .
my friend .
he's in my acting class .
you told him i'm an actor?
is he any good?
ls he talented , or ...?
really?
how does dick know this guy?
they grew up together .
okay , wednesday at the hotel , 3 : 00 .

elliot , don't call me here anymore , especially not on sunday , all right?
what did he say?
just hold on .
shut up for a second .
hey , you guys .
this is what's going to happen .
three o'clock , beverly ambassador , he wants to see everybody .
okay?
and , he'll talk to you .
if after talking to you he likes you ... he'll deal with you .
if he doesn't , he'll say , " fuck you , " and walk out of the room .
did you tell him i was a ...?
shut up .
and he wants a sample bag .
no problem on all counts .
great .
did you tell him i was an actor?
yes , i told him .
you told him i was good?
yeah , i lied .
hi .

clarence worley from detroit?
he's hanging with a pretty girl named alabama?
yeah , i know them .

no , they're staying at the ...
safari motor , motel lnn .

alabama , you were perfect .

i'm going to go grab us something to eat .
i'll go jump in the tub and get all wet , and slippery , and soapy .
and hop onto that waterbed .
and watch x rated movies ... until you get your ass back into my loving arms .

we now return to bullit already in progress .
hi .

alabama , where's our coke?
and where's clarence?
when's he coming back?
i'm sorry , i think you have the wrong room .
my name is sadie .
we don't have any coke , but there's a pepsi machine down the hall .
i don't know anybody named clarence .
perhaps my husband does .
you can ask him because he'll be home in a minute .
he plays football .
he's just at practice .
give me your hand .
okay .
you are unbelievably cute .
thank you .
thanks .
let me see those eyes .
what a face .
do me a favor .
turn around for me .
okay .
no , go the other way .
okay .
that hurts , don't it?
get on your feet , sweetie .
you ain't hurt that bad .
now , where's our coke?
where's clarence?
and when's he comin 'back?
okay .
fuck you .
fuck me ....
what's the matter , baby , huh?
can't breathe?
you better get used to that .
hi .

two chili fries .
and ... two large diet cokes .

no .
i hadn't .
that's probably the best piece i've read on elvis presley in my entire life .
look at this .
see , it tries to pin down ... what the attraction is after all these years .
it covers the whole spectrum .
talks to the fans ... people who grew up with him and love his music .
then , there's the fanatics .
right?
i don't know about you , but they give me the creeps .
yeah , yeah , i see what you mean .
i mean , look at her .
looks like she fell off the ugly tree and hit every branch on the way down .
now the first time you kill somebody , that's the hardest .
i don't give a shit if you're fuckin 'wired up , or jack the ripper .
remember that guy in texas?
the guy up in that fucking tower , killed all them people?
i bet you green money , the first little black dot he took a beat on ... that was the bitch of the bunch .
first one is tough .
no fucking fooling .
the second one ain't no fuckin 'mardi gras ... but it's better than the first 'cause you still feel the same thing ... except it's more diluted .
you know , it's better .
i threw up on the first one , you believe that?
then the third one .
the third one is easy , you level right off .
that's no problem .
now ....
shit !
now , i do it just to watch their fuckin 'expression change .
i don't fuckin 'believe it .
did you put it under the bed?
yes .
i can't believe it .
you put it under the fucking bed .

you're the one who wanted to drive fast .
read my lips .

asshole .
after all i did for you , you whore !
who the fuck do you think you ...?
hi .
look , dickhead .
it's your bad luck that we caught you speeding ... and it's your bad luck that you had a bag of uncut cocaine .
not a little vial .
a fucking baggy .
hey , you got caught .
it's all fun until you get caught .
now we got you .
okay , mr. elliot , fucking actor , you just made the big time .
you're no longer an extra ...
a bit player . a supporting actor .
you're a fucking star .
you'll be playing your one man show ... nightly for the next two fucking years !
for a captive audience .
you'll get out in a few years and meet some old lady .
you'll marry and be understanding to your wife's needs ... because you'll know what it's like to be a woman .
you'll only want to fuck her ass 'cause her pussy won't be tight enough .
good point , detective .
right?
fucking faggot !
krinkle , this is it , and it's all ours .
i mean , talk about falling into something ....
would you shut up !
i can't understand shit .
what happened?
what are you talking about?
okay , all right .
patrol car pulls a guy over for speeding .
suspect is covered with coke ... so they bring him to me and nicholson .
nicholson and l .
what's the difference?
we go to work on him .
we know something is strange 'cause he ... is fucking stupid , and he's got a big bag of coke , and it's uncut .
and you won't believe what he's got to say .
seems a cop from some department , stole ... $500, 000 worth of coke from the property cage ....
he sat on the shit for a year and a half .
now , the cop's got this weirdo ...
suspect's words . to front for him .
our guy , elliot blitzer , is making a deal between them and his boss ... big time fucking movie producer named lee donowitz .
he did coming home in a body bag .
a vietnam movie?
yeah .
good fucking movie .
fucking a. great fucking movie .
so , do you believe him?
i believe he believes him .
this guy is too rattled to be lying .
he'd roll over on his mom , dad , his two pantied granny ... and the king of siam if he had anything on him .
this guy was a sissy .
this rabbit will do anything not to do any time .
you know what he'll do?
he'll wear a wire .
he'll wear a wire?
he'll wear a wire , we talked to him .
dirty cops , we got to get lnternal affairs on this .
i don't care who you bring in .
you can bring in the state enlisted ... the ghost of steve mcqueen , ten roman gladiators .
i don't give a shit as long as me and todd get credit for the bust .
listen , we found him .
we just want the fucking collar .
that's it .
end of story .
you got it .
did i ever tell you how much i hate airports?
see , i used to live by one back in dearborn , you know .
really frustrating living next to an airport when you don't got shit .
and all day long i'm seeing and hearing people doing exactly ... what i want to be doing , but couldn't .
what?
starting new lives , leaving detroit , vacations , business trips ... fun , fun , fun .
knowing us , we can jump on any of those planes ... and go anywhere we want .
gives me a whole new outlook .
love how it works out .
you're not kidding .
we got lives to start over .
we should go somewhere where we can start from scratch .
i've been in america all my life .
i'd like to see what tv in other countries is like .
where do you think we should go , my little turtle dove?
cancn .
cancn , why cancn?
it's got a nice ring to it .
sounds like a movie .
clarence and alabama go to cancn , don't you think?
in my movie , darling , you get top billing .
don't worry about nothing , all right?
it's all going to work out for us .
we deserve it .
you sure that's how you get to the beverly ambassador?
yeah , man , i'm positive .
let me tell you , if we get lost that's your ass .
why don't you get out of my beer and get a fucking job?
yeah , okay .
can we go?
we're out the door .
we must meet elliot in the lobby .
i 'll see we got everything .
you all right?
yes .

wait , wait , wait !

i'm going to talk to you tomorrow .
all right?
we got to go .
i got the part .
wow !
i got the part .
that's perfect .
that's great .
that's wonderful .
didn't even want a callback .
that's cool , way to go !
i got a 7 : 00 call .
that's great .
come on , let's go .
i want to hear all about it , okay?
come on .
hey , clarence !
what?
nothing .
forget it .
all right , come on .
hey , get some beer ...
and some cleaning products .
i'm losing a fucking fortune over here .
you talkin 'to me , you fucking wop , you?
put your jacket on .
put your jacket on .
ready?
yeah .
put your jacket on .
one sleeve at a time .
it's a big game , now , elliot .
it's okay , come on .
you all right?
no .
elliot , look at me .
look at me .
you comfortable?
am i comfortable?
i've got a ...
like a , brick in my scrotum .
that's the best place for it , okay?
they won't search your balls .
you think they might see this?
no .
it's okay .
when you stand up , it'll be okay .
elliot .
yeah?
say something .
okay .
hi .
how are you?
my name is elliot , and i'm with the cub scouts of america .
we're , we're selling uncut cocaine to get to the jamboree .
just talk regular , elliot .
i'm sorry .
elliot , stop fucking around .
i can't believe i'm doing this .
you get that shit?
remember , we'll be right down the hall monitoring you .
and if somebody does something you can't hear ...
like puts a gun to my fucking eye?
we've done this a thousand times .
we know what we're doing .
okay?
we're the best at ....
now , listen .
no fucking around .
anything happens , we'll be there like fucking gangbusters?
you must remember something .
you don't want to go to jail , right?
no .
i don't want to go to jail .
so , what do we got to do?
we got to put your boss in jail , okay?
you do that , and you got to show in court , beyond any reasonable doubt ... that this respectable man in the hollywood community ... is dealing cocaine .
we must prove it , and you must do it .
that's what we're doing here .
you're going to be okay , you won't get hurt .
okay?
so what you got to do is to get him ... to admit on tape , all right?
that he's buying this coke .
okay , champ?
get a hold of yourself .
okay .
i'm going to get some coffee .
alabama , you really got that playing basketball?
yes , i got an elbow right in the eye .
then ...
i got hurled the ball when i'm not looking .
wham !
right in my face .
you should be careful .
i should .
what the fuck did you bring that for?
in case .
in case of what?
i don't know , what do you want me to say?
look , clarence , lee donowitz is not a pimp .
i know that , but one thing this week has taught me ... it's better to have a gun and not need it than to need a gun and not have it .
there he is .
elliot , your motivation is to stay out of jail .
easy , easy , easy .
hi .
hi .
i guess it's about that time .
yeah .
here we go .
you're an actor .
act , motherfucker .
elliot .
yeah?
get on your knees .
oh , no .
what?
i said get on your knees !
what the fuck?
shut the fuck up !
i know what the fuck i'm doing .
you think i'm pretty fucking stupid , don't you?
don't you?
no?
don't you fucking lie to me , you motherfucker !
he's bluffing you , elliot .
can't you see that?
i want to hear you say ...
you are , without a doubt ...
what's wrong?

i want to hear you say it !
you are , without a doubt , the dumbest fucker ...
... i've ever seen on this planet " .

dumb fucker .
apparently , i'm not as dumb ...
he didn't do nothing !
i'm not as dumb as you fucking think i am , am l?
what the fuck is waiting for us up there?
what the fuck's waiting for us?
he's going to shoot him .
tell me , or i'll pump two in your face right here and now .
he's not going to shoot him .
motherfuck !
he's going to shoot him .
like nick curry said , " if i'm wrong ...
... i'll fucking apologize , all right?
something's amiss , i feel it .
if anything strange goes down , you'll be the first one shot .
he didn't do anything , what are you ...
shut up !
i'll blow this motherfucker away .
fuck you !
i wish somebody would come and get me because i don't like this anymore !
get a hold of yourself , you fucking sissy !
i really wish somebody would just come and take me away !

i can't take this , i'm sorry , but i just can't !
i wish somebody would just come to my rescue ... and everything will be all right .
elliot .
elliot .

i'm sorry , all right?
i'm sorry .
i'm sorry .

yeah , go down ...
you guys want to smoke a bowl , or ....
oh .
go down beachwood ... and drive awhile , and then you gotta turn right , okay?
and then you go , and you keep driving and you keep driving .
hello , elliot .
monty .

yeah , yeah , you could say that .
everybody , this is monty .
hi .
come on in .
lee's in the can , he'll be out in a quick .
holy shit , look at this .
do you believe this?
it's a helicopter .
sorry , it's nothing personal .
clarence .
there'll be no need to search me , daredevil .
all you'll find is this right here .
now what compelled you to bring that along?
the same thing that compelled you guys ... to bring heavy artillery to a business meeting .
i'll take that .
well , you're going to have to .
oh .
hi .
everybody's here .
elliot .
who's who?
that's dick on the end there .
oh , that's dick .
elliot tells me you're quite gifted .
and , yeah , alabama in the middle .
hello .
clarence on the end .
lee , this guy is ....
boris , please .
i'm meeting people now .
mr. donowitz?
come on .
don't insult me , just call me " lee " .
lee .
boris , shut the fuck up !
come on , everybody , don't be shy .
come on in .
okay , lee?
lee .
lee .
that's right , lee .
i just gotta tell you , i really am a big fan .
coming home ln a body bag is my favorite movie .
after apocalypse now , i think it's the best vietnam movie ever made .
wow .
thank you very much , clarence .
lee .
what?
this guy is packing .
really .
well , i mean , i've been pretty scared about this whole thing .
i'm fairly confident you're here to do business , so look .
i don't want to be a wise guy .
if you want , i'll lay my gun on the table .
it's up to you .
no , i don't think that's necessary .
boris , be nice .
make everybody some coffee .
okay?
a pleasure to meet you .
nice to meet you , too .
honey , sit down .
relax , relax .
elliot , you look like shit .
oh , i'm sorry .
i mean , it's completely disgusting .
if i could get a quick signature , it would be great .
whatever bonnie wants .
like my dailies , there , clar?
is that what these are?
you like them?
they're great .
they better be , they cost me enough .
what did that day cost me? $357, 000 .
elliot , i swear to god , somebody is stealing from me .
what's this one called , anyway?
it's a sequel to body bag .
really?
we don't have a title yet , but what does joe like?
body bags two .
oh .
that's imaginative .
i've got more taste in my penis .
this guy is really fucking funny .
most of these movies that win a lot of oscars , i can't stand them .
they're safe , geriatric , coffee table dog shit , you know?
we park our cars in the same garage .
it's all right .
all they make are unwatchable movies from unreadable books .
mad max , that's a movie .
the good the bad and the ugly ...
rio bravo , those are movies .
and coming home in a body bag , that was a movie .
it was the only movie that won oscars with balls ...
i mean , since deerhunter .
i don't believe you .
what , do you like a little coffee with your sugar , or what?
lee , i'm not satisfied until the spoon stands straight up .
give me a coffee , will you?
my uncle roger and my uncle jerry , who were in nam ... saw coming home in a body bag .
they said that's the most accurate vietnam film ... they had ever seen .
i'll tell you .
when veterans in that war say that about my project ... it makes the whole thing worthwhile .
here's to you .
my friend , oops , i just met you .
you know why?
i think because we got the same interests .
and you know what i'd like to do right now?
i'd like to see dr. zhivago .
where is it?
is there a fucking doctor in the house , or what?
hang on a second .
when you see this , you are going to shit .
i better .
what's the guy's name?
donowitz .
lee , that's all practically uncut .
if you so desire ... you can cut that a lot more .
don't worry , i'll desire .
get me another cup of coffee , will you?
me , too , boris .
i have to hand it to you , clarence , this is not nose garbage .
this is quality stuff .
perfect merchandise .
the only trouble is ... when i'm offered a deal that's too good to be true ... it's because it's a lie .
convince me you're on the level .
convince him .
if he don't bite , we have nothing but possession .
we got lots of sandwich shit back there , make something .
we got pastrami , nice rye ....
anybody want anything?
you , got any aspirin?
yeah , sure .
get him that .
well , lee , it's like this .
you're getting this bargain because i don't know what i'm doing .
you're used to dealing with professionals which i'm not .
i'm a rank amateur .
what the fuck is going on?
what's going on , joe?

i want a car .
take me to the airport !
and i want it full of gas !
and a million bucks !
small bills !
and fast !
i am going to do this bitch , motherfuckers !
amid the chaos of that day ... when all i could hear was the thunder of gunshots ... and all i could smell was the violence in the air ...
i look back and am amazed ... that my thoughts were so clear and true .
that three words went through my mind endlessly .
repeating themselves like a broken record .
you're so cool .
you're so cool .
you're so cool .
and sometimes clarence asks me what would i have done if he had died .
if that bullet had been two inches more to the left .
to this , i always smile .
as if i'm not going to satisfy him with a response .
but i always do .
i tell him of how i would want to die .
but that the anguish and the want of death would fade ...
like the stars at dawn .
and that things would be much like they are now .
perhaps .
except maybe i wouldn't have named our son ...
elvis .
