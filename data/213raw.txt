yes .
very cute .
five?
four , when that picture was taken .
oh .
six now .
it was unfortunate about ...
aguilar .
but tough decisions do go with the job .
burden of command , correct?
look .
these salutes , i've given them some thought .
technically , they are not a violation of regulations .
so , if the inmates can confine themselves to a simple ... hand movement through the hair ,
i see no problem with it .
and if the men want to call you chief , well , that's fine .
free speech and all that .
okay , then .
no , not okay .
it's too late , colonel .
it's too late for what?
for your offer .
the men don't want to salute .
they don't want to use rank .
they don't want better food .
they don't want more tv .
they just want your resignation .
so do i.
my resignation?
you're a disgrace , colonel .
a disgrace to the uniform .
you should not be allowed to retain your command .
well , then i'd better go pack .
i think you should .
oh?
tell me , mr. irwin , what's to stop me from just ... placing you in the hole ... for , say , six months?
nothing .
if that's the way you want to win .
sir , if i can make a suggestion ,
maybe we should isolate prisoner irwin  get me general wheeler .
yes , sir .
two weeks ago , i watched as he marched a man up and down the yard .
a minor eccentricity .
fine .
since then , he's been acting as though ... he still has a command in some fantasy army .
and yesterday  i don't think you'd want to make general .
now , you wouldn't want to give up all these perks , would you?
sorry .
go on .
yesterday , mr. irwin ... told me he required my resignation .
frankly , i think he's started to lose the plot .
you saying he's delusional?
i'm saying he needs professional psychiatric help .
he's sick and becoming pathetic .
uh , you might want to be a little more careful in your word choice .
that sick , pathetic man put this star on my shoulder .
yes , sir .
i know .
and i also know that you sat in on his court martial .
and don't talk about things that are above your pay grade .
hmm?
yes , sir .
general wheeler , i admire the man as much as you do .
so i want to see that he gets the best care possible .
and i'm not sure that this is the right place for that .
all right .
well , let me see him .
do we read the rules , sir?
read 'em .
well , sir , normally for a contact visit , folks are limited to one embrace in the beginning and one at the end .
and , uh , hands must be visible at all times , also .
i guess that rules out the hand job .
thank you , gentlemen .
permission to be seated , sir .
permission granted .
what are you doing here , jim?
i'm here to see if you ve lost your mind .
uh , he should be available later .
i can take a mes just a second .
good morning , miss kelly .
jim jim , yeah hold on  miss kelly?
miss kelly , i got everything here but ...
the athletic gear .
i found that
i found that top one laying on the floor out in the hallway .
hold on one second .
what , danny?
i found that top one ...
laying on the floor in the hallway .
fine .
thanks , danny .
uh , yeah .
we just needed you to send him up here as soon as possible .
he's saying you're delusional , that you're acting as if you're still in command of an army .
he's saying i'm delusional because he wants me gone .
now , if you had ironclad evidence ... of winter killing a man in cold blood for no good reason , then i could do something , maybe .
outside of that , the man's been investigated three times .
he's been exonerated three times .
and as far as washington is concerned ,
he's doin 'a superb job .
yeah , and you're a convicted criminal .
you could get another investigation .
yes , i could .
but without any new evidence , what would be the point?
and besides that , gene , honestly ,
i don't give a rat's ass .
i don't care .
what i care about is you and getting you out of here .
now , haven't you punished yourself enough?
what i did was wrong , jim .
all teams .
all teams , this is a full s. o. r. t. alert .
all teams , this is a full s. o. r. t. alert .
i cannot let this continue .
now , you will get out of here , and you will go spend some time ... with your daughter and your grandson .
i can have my staff write up a compassionate release on medical grounds .
it can say whatever you want it to say .
there's nothing wrong with me .
for christ's sake , will you work with me?
there is nothing wrong with me .
i see no indication of anything , sir .
of course not .
he'll keep it hidden until the last possible second .
red team , go .
go , go , go !
gene , what the hell is this about?
is this about control?
because , you know , no castle can have two kings .
go , go , go , go , go !
get down !
on the floor , now !
general , you must come with us .
what are you doing?
all inmates remain on the ground in the prone position .
all inmates remain on the ground
let's go !
what is this !
what is this for christ's sake?
go !
let's go !
go , go , go , go !
all right !
sir?
tear gas?
return to hangar .
nothing is happening .
it was a bluff .
you can take her home .
return to hangar .
you thought he was gonna try to take me hostage?
yes , it was a precautionary move .
what the hell kind of ... grab ass unit are you running here , colonel?
sir , at 1 1 : 58 this morning , i received a letter ... stating a group of inmates were planning on taking you hostage at 1 2 : 1 0 .
i thought it prudent to act immediately to ensure your safety .
i've been hearing some disturbing things about what goes on in here .
and now i'm hearing it from a man i trust and whose opinion i respect .
may i speak freely , sir?
yes , you may .
with all due respect , general ,
i don't know what you may have been hearing .
but until you've spent some time in the yard with those animals , you have no idea what happens in there .
point taken , colonel .
nevertheless , if i hear ... one more story about a man dying under your command , you are through here .
do you understand me?
yes , sir .
all right .
as far as gene irwin is concerned , it is my judgment he is as sane as you or i.
i wish he wasn't .
he is .
frankly , i'd like nothing more than an excuse to get him out of here .
but i see the only way that's gonna happen is if you request it .
that is true , sir .
so you just you tell me you can't handle him .
he's gone .
oh , i think i can handle him , sir .
you watch yourself , colonel .
eugene r. irwin , lieutenant general , united states army , in direct contravention of an order to evacuate burundi ... by his commander in chief
that is the president , for those of you who do not know . ... selected a platoon of men to extractjackson ngwe , a local warlord . disregarding reliable intelligence , general irwin's reconnaissance team entered the ville at 0300 .
eight men were captured and executed .
disregarding ... reliable intelligence ... eight men ... were executed .
what i want you men to understand ... is what the consequences can be ... when you choose to follow a man who is motivated ... solely by his pride .
a man who will do anything for one more victory notch on his belt , no matter what the cost , before he fades away .
start the extractions .
over here !
come here !
let's go .
get out !
get out !
hi , doc .
let's go for a little walk .
get the fuck back !
open 355 !
open it up !
look at you .
relax , ladies .
hold him down , men !
i had nothing to do with this !
no !
uhh !
why don't you just execute me?
no reason for that !
turn him around .
don't put me in the hole !
oh , don't don't put me in the hole !
no !
you want that?
no .
thanks , man .
you bet .
what do we do now?
jimmy , wait up !
attention , inmates .
all visitation requests must be submitted ... to thes 3by 1 100 today .
all visitation requests  so , you really did you really did bluff winter .
the problem is his flush beat your straight .
i don't play poker , mr. yates .
i play chess .
and in chess , you play with somebody long enough , you come to realize that their first three moves are usually the same .
chess , huh?
what was his first move?
what was the first move?
first , uh , two teams ,
20 men apiece .
like i was saying , the inside teams only have batons .
second?
second?
water cannon .
third?
what kind of chopper?
chopper .
sir , are you sure we should be having this discussion this man standing
you know he can't be trusted , right?
i don't know .
is that how you use the burden of command?
to make men into into , uh , chess pieces?
yes .
hey , yates .
why don t you do yourself a favor and run along .
pawns .
that prisoner walking away , who is that?
uh , that's that's yates .
he was an apache pilot , but now he's a lowlife a hustler .
he takes bets .
on what?
anything .
fights , the weather .
he even took bets on whether irwin was gonna kill himself .
classical ]
ahhh .
this highly effective officer seems to have no moral grounding whatsoever .
is that so?
well , that's what men better than me seem to think , sir .
why are you here , yates?
i would like your version .
i was involved in a drug smuggling operation from juarez to el paso ... including several of my subordinates , sir .
you were involved .
you ran it , did you not?
correct .
says here that you wore a wire on your men .
is that correct?
yeah .
and how many years ... did they take off your sentence for ... that?
four years , sir .
and now you're the prison bookie .
tell me , yates , how does a man like you ... get into west point?
my father was a winner of the congressional medal of honor , sir .
oh , right .
well , sometimes the apple does fall far from the tree .
your father
your father was a pow with mr. irwin , was he not?
yes , that is correct .
and yet , you haven't seen fit to join mr. irwin's
crusade?
crusade .
why is that?
it's not my fight .
mr. irwin is in a fight?
it says here you have three years ...
left with us .
correct?
that's what it says .
that's what it says .
does three months sound better?
i need to resolve this situation ... quickly ... before someone else gets hurt ... or killed .
do you agree?
i guess .
and the way i need to do that is with information .
so , you might want to rethink ... your joining mr. irwin's ... crusade .
you asking me to be your snitch , sir?
isn't it a little late in the game to be self righteous?
dude , why i got to get my ass kicked?
how many times you gonna ask?
stop your sniveling .
i'm only gonna hit you once .
well , when?
now !
fight !
fight !
fight !
sit your tray down !
hey , fucker !
back off now !
i said back off now !
on your cans !
let's get on !
sit your asses down , now !
let's go !
you guys , we don't have much time .
we can no longer wear the uniform of a soldier .
we forfeited that right .
and that includes me .
i disobeyed an executive order .
i violated my duty as a commanding officer .
and eight men paid a catastrophic price .
it's a mistake not easy to live with .
so , here lam , just like you , a convicted criminal .
the only difference between you and me is i know i'm guilty .
so we're packed away here as prisoners .
and one thing is certain .
our captors have the power .
they can try to humiliate us .
they can beat us .
they can lock us away in a dark hole for days on end .
but there's one thing they cannot do .
they cannot take away from us who we are .
and we are soldiers .
yeah , that's right .
it is the one thing it is the one thing that gives us a chance in here .
and that nobody can ever take away .
yeah , that's right .
the uniform code of military justice .
grounds for removal of a stockade or disciplinary barracks commander :  one .
dereliction of duty .
that's right .
yeah .  two .
criminal malfeasance .
noncompliance with procedural rules .
yeah . four .
making false official statements . five .
conduct unbecoming to an officer and gentleman .
yeah ! six .
cruelty and maltreatment of persons under his command .
seven .
command failure resulting in loss of control of facility .
gentlemen , i propose that we seize control of this facility .
take a look at a castle , any castle .
now , break down the elements that make it a castle .
location .
protection .
garrison .
flag .
the only difference between this castle and all the rest ...
is they were built to keep people out .
forward .
ho .
this castle was built to keep people in .
but it's still a castle .
and any castle can be taken , whether you're fighting in the 14th century or the 21 st .
to succeed in a castle war , you have to overcome the garrison , take the high ground ... and ultimately capture the flag .
okay?
enriquez .
all right .
you set up a command post , okay?
and here , you have the guard well , here .
first of all , this is admin building ,
winter's office , guards .
okay?
phase one , neutralize winter's guards .
phase two , towers .
control the towers , you control the yard .
tower one , tower two , tower three , tower four .
tower four is zamorro guy to watch .
phase three , water cannon .
four , helicopter .
helicopter's the high ground .
takin 'the helicopter's gonna be a bitch .
but it's doable .
finally , the flag .
capture the flag .
when we capture the flag , it's raised upside down .
distress .
right .
right .
upside down means , send help .
the fort has fallen .
we raise it upside down , and keep it that way until wheeler arrives and sees it .
then , we've won .
yates , shut the fu you see what i mean about him?
hey , yates , what are you doin 'here , huh?
i don't know .
ask him .
he invited me .
general , i know , uh , his father served with you in vietnam , but do we really need him around?
yeah .
he stays .
duffy?
are you in maintenance?
yes , sir .
yates .
got a minute?
how am i doin '?
five to two , in the colonel's favor .
well , you don't think i can win .
he knows too
he knows too much .
he's prepared .
he's ready .
he may be prepared , but he's not ready .
you know , we can use you .
hey , look , i just want to survive this and go home .
you make a deal with him?
what?
that's what i would do .
go to you .
he knows what you re capable of .
listen , man .
but so do i.
oh , yeah?
well , i know what you're capable of .
i know your type very well .
is that right?
is that from your infinite years of experience on the battlefield?
why do you think i should help you?
can you get me out of here?
no .
then what are you going to do for me?
oh , you're going to make me a soldier again?
is that what you re doing?
i get to be all i can be?
you gonna teach me to salute?
you know what?
this is about the time i would be giving you my internal soldier speech .
but the truth is , you probably never should have been a soldier .
your father was .
that's how i saw him .
you saw him as a disappointment .
okay .
get past it .
that was then .
the only thing that matters here is ... what we are now and what we do now .
this man is going to you because he sees the worst in you .
he's going to play for the worst .
i want to see the best .
that means there's no middle .
now , these men need you .
and i need you .
now , it's your choice .
and don't tell me you're surviving here , yates .
you're hiding .
how's it going this evening , sir?
fine , sergeant .
how are you?
sir?
prisoner yates wishes to have a word .
give me five minutes , captain .
hi .
hi .
colonel winter's office .
yeah .
yeah , go ahead and just send it up .
sir .
sir?
yes .
prisoner yates .
you want me to do this thing for you?
this 30 days this three months , it's not gonna cut it .
i got to get out of here immediately .
i got to get out of here tomorrow .
i'm afraid that's not possible .
look , when this thing explodes , everyone's gonna know it's me who yakked .
and then my life's worth nothing .
so , either you get me out of here immediately ... or you find another guy who knows as much as i do ... and who's willing to spill it .
good luck .
the soonest i can get you out is one week .
sir , i'm not gonna last
i won't last seven seconds let alone seven days .
well , you can ride the week out in the hole .
no one will get you there .
so what does mr. irwin have planned for us?
he's planning to take over the prison .
really .
well , that information won't get you released .
that information won't even get you extra potatoes at lunch .
i know the details .
i know how he plans to neutralize your men , how he plans to take over the tower , weapons and tools he's building .
do you know when?
yates , i know you're in there !

and where are they going to get a flag?

a great general once said , you tell your men , 'you're soldiers . that's our flag . 'you tell them , 'nobody takes our flag . 'raise your flag so it flies high where everyone can see it .
now you've got yourself a castle .
where the years have gone i have years to go
workin 'for the man to pay the debt i owe
well , the time may pass but the truth will stand
when the good lord shakes this calloused hand
you can call my name it's time to go
but i'll never be free till it's chiseled in stone
ain't no man gonna carry my load
i gotta be a man and do it on my own
devil's in my path and the hound's on my heel
have to walk in my shoes just to know how i feel
the devil's callin 'my name he's the one who knows
that i'll never be free till it's chiseled in stone
chiseled in stone
well , i keep ongoin 'though there's no way out
every stone in my path is a brick in my house
a man's life is built all along the way
by the things that he's done and the choices he's made
someday they'll call my name i'll have a place of my own
but i'll never be free till it's chiseled in stone
on the final day when the whistle blows
i can rest my body i can rest my soul
i built my castle in the promised land
it's made of rocks and stone and like the shifting sands
when they mention my name after i'm long gone
well , they'll know i'm free 'cause it's chiseled in stone
chiseled in stone .
