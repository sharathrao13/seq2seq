you wanna talk about the vanishing wilderness?
why are you so anxious about this?
because they're building a dam across the cahulawasse river .
they're gonna flood a whole valley , bobby .
they're drowning the river , man .
we're talkin 'to you .
all right .
just about the last wild , untamed , unpolluted , unfucked up river in the south .
don't you understand?
we understand .
there ain't gonna be no more river .
just gonna be a big , dead lake .
it's a very clean way to make electric power .
those lakes provide many people with recreation .
my father in law has a houseboat on lake bowie .
you push a little more power into atlanta ... ... a little more air conditioners for your smug little suburb ... ... and you know what's gonna happen?
they're gonna rape this whole landscape .
they're gonna rape it .
that's an extreme point of view , lewis .
it is .
extremist .
we're gonna leave friday from atlanta .
i'm gonna have you back in your little suburban house ... ... in time to see the football game on sunday afternoon .
i know you'll be back in time to see the pompom girls at halftime .
i know that's all you care about .
lewis , i wanna thank you .
is there any hillbillies up here?
yeah , there's some people up there that ain't never seen a town before .
no bigger than aintry , anyway .
them , those woods , are real deep .
the river's inaccessible , except at a couple of points .
how we gonna get there , lewis?
i'm gonna take you there .
what the hell do you know about canoein '?
i know enough about canoein 'to handle the both of you .
i don't know what that means , but i'll go along with you .
this is the last chance we got to see this river .
just wait until you feel that white water under you .
ain't that right?
i don't know if i'm ready .
if we are lost , i don't wanna hear about it .
i've never been iost in my iife .
i'ii have you in the water in another hour .
christ , drew !
drew , look at the junk .
look here .
i think this is where everything finishes up .
we just may be at the end of the line .
hey , not so loud , bobby .
let's not upset these people .
people?
what people?
this area may be evacuated already .
that's my '51 dodge .
no , that's my car .
that's my car .
all my youth and passion ... ... spent in that back seat .
it's all gone you see .
all gone .
rust and dust .
lewis ... ... we got a live one here .
howdy .
howdy .
let me ask you something .
are you from the power company?
power company?
what power company?
about the dam .
no , no , no .
look , come here a minute .
see that car there?
we want somebody to drive 'em down to aintry for us .
hell , you're crazy .
no shit .
fill that one up with gas , okay?
say , mister ...
i love the way you wear that hat .
you don't know nothin '.
lewis , just ask him about his hat .
i don't think you understood me .
i wanna get some drivers ... ... to drive this car ... ... and that car down to aintry .
you understand?
you might get the griner brothers .
who?
the griner brothers .
where do they live?
they live back over that way .
$4 . 99 .
right .
talk about genetic deficiencies .
isn't that pitiful?
who's pickin 'the banjo here?
come on , i'm with you .
i'm iost .
i could play all day with that guy .
i believe you could , too .
i believe you could .
that's good .
that's very good , sir .
goddamn , you play a mean banjo .
hey , you wanna play another one?
give him a couple of bucks .
can that chubby boy handle himself?
who?
bobby?
he's rather well thought of in his field , lewis .
insurance?
i've never been insured in my iife .
i don't believe in insurance .
there's no risk .
i have some .
over here .
shit !
god almighty !
anything we can do for you?
no .
it ain't as bad as i thought .
your name griner?
what do you wanna know for?
can you and your brother drive two cars down to aintry for us?
drive 'em down there for what?
me and my buddy , we're gonna take a canoe trip down the cahulawasse .
we'd like to have them cars in aintry when we get there .
be there by sunday noon .
canoe trip?
that's right , a canoe trip .
what the hell you wanna go fuck around in that river for?
because it's there .
it's there all right .
you get in there and can't get out , you gonna wish it wasn't .
listen , lewis , let's go back to town and ... ... play golf .
i'll give you $30 to take those cars down to aintry .
i'd take $50 .
$50 , my ass .
lewis , don't play games with these people .
what'd you say?
i said , " $50 , my ass .
lewis !
i'ii do it for $40 .

brando , come on out !
we heard all this  i said it's all set , drew .
this river cruise gonna happen or not?
just get in your car , huh?
lewis , for god's sake !
you think we should let 'em show us to the river?
if i thought that , i would have let them go first , ed .
we know about where it is .
here we go .
well , we fucked up .
you better let them show us .
you're missin 'the whole point , ed .
where are you goin ', city boy?
we'll find it .
it's only the biggest fuckin 'river in the state .
we'll find it .
lewis , you son of a bitch , why do we have to go so damn fast?
you're gonna like it .
when you see the river , you're gonna like it .
jesus christ !
lewis .
are you all right?
lewis , you are gonna kill us both , you son of a bitch ... ... before we ever see any water .
slow it down , lewis , come on .
come on , don't fool around .
listen , ed .
listen .
hear it?
sometimes you have to lose yourself before you can find anything .
any snakes around here?
this is the one .
there she is .
looks good .
a couple of more months and she'll all be gone .
even up as far as here?
from aintry on up .
one big , dead lake .
over here !
couldn't we have found a harder place to get in?
this is steep here , now .
all right .
watch yourself .
i'm watchin '.
you're losin 'glass on your bow .
it's freezin '!
hell , it'll hold .
what the hell are we gonna do ... ... if we come off this river and our cars aren't there?
they'll be there .
they're rough lookin 'boys , them hillbillies .
you judge people by the way they look .
you can trust 'em .
i'm goin 'with you , ed , and not with mr. lewis medlock .
i saw how he drives these country roads ... ... he don't know nothin 'about .
i guess you're gonna be with me , chubby .
get them supplies up there .
it's cold !
put this on .
looks like my mama's corset or something .
here you go .
thank you .
okay , let's go .
i'm comin '.
can't go in the water without your paddle , boy .
i coulda went up the river without my oar .
shit !
if we hit any strong water ...
... instead of bare assin 'through it ...
i'm ready .
come on .
i'm comin 'on .
i got myself a plump partner here .
we can save ourselves considerable hardship ... ... if we just back water , talk it out before we make our move .
you got that , boy?
all right , put on your life jacket .
which way are we goin '?
i think downstream would be a good idea , don't you?
all right .
you and bobby see some rocks , you yell out now , right?
lewis , is this the way you get your rocks off?
let's go .
let's go .
keep your eyes open , drew .
i'ii race you .
keep your eyes open , robert .
that a boy , that a boy .
every move you make , call it out .
i'm behind you .
right .
here we go .
see how fast we can shoot this bush .
what is this?
is this some fast water we're comin 'up to?
all right , drew , just get in behind lewis there .
look at this !
let's pick up some speed .
all right .
let's go .
just a little , there you have it .
to the left .
hey , now , that didn't hurt too bad , did it?
i'm with you , ed .
now you got it , boy .
very good .
look , ed .
well , for the lord's sake , will you look at that?
what do we do now?
this is gonna be fun !
just follow us !
hey , what happens if we flip this thing over?
now that you brought that up , hang on to your paddle .
and if you hit any rocks , don't hit 'em with your head .
watch lewis .
maybe we can learn something .
back water now .
oh , yeah .
go right .
go right , go right .
go right , go right .
look up ahead where you're goin '!
all right , i'm lookin '.
don't quit , don't quit .
come on , paddle , paddle .

are you gonna call them out now?
right , go right .
go right .
all right , now left .

all right .
keep it straight .
watch that tree .
left .
watch your head .
we ain't gonna make it !

hey , this doesn't seem right .
just a little unorthodox .
go left , chubby .
come on .
straighten it out .
all right , i got it straight .
oh , my god !
yes , thank you , lord .
turn it around .
hold it up there .
slow it down .
all right , go .

hell , here's a big one !
we're gonna make it .
keep it straight .
i'm with you , ed !
all right .
you're doin 'all right , now .
keep her headed right .
go , go , go ...
there's a rock !
on the right , watch it now .
okay , now .
i got it .
all right now , chubby , don't fall apart .
what the hell i tell you?
he's something else , ain't he?
hold on .
i'll tell you , lewis ... ... that's the best , the second best sensation i ever felt .
you did good , chubby , you did good .
damn , i thought we'd bought the farm there for a while .
you know that one place there ...
you know what i was just thinking?
the first explorers saw this country ... ... saw it just like us .
in a canoe .
i can imagine how they felt .
yeah , we beat it , didn't we?
didn't we beat that?
you don't beat it .
you don't beat this river .
machines are gonna fail .
and the system's gonna fail .
then ...
and then what?
then survival .
who has the ability to survive .
that's the game : survive .
and you can't wait for it to happen , can you?
you can't wait for it .
well , the system's done all right by me .
oh , yeah .
you got a nice job .
got a nice house ... ... nice wife ... ... nice kid .
you make that sound ... ... rather shitty , lewis .
why do you go on these trips with me , ed?
i iike my iife , lewis .
yeah , but why do you go on these trips with me?
you know , sometimes i wonder about that .
here's to you , lewis .
hot damn , he got one !
terrific , lewis .
i hate him .
i'm glad we came here .
lewis?
lewis does not drink .
it's true , lewis , what you said .
there's somethin 'in the woods and the water that we have lost in the city .
we didn't lose it , just sold it .
well , i'll say one thing for the system .
system did produce the air mattress .
or , as it's better known among we camping types , the instant broad .
and if you fellas will excuse me , i'm gonna go be mean to my air mattress .
i do baptize thee now , in the name of modern technology .
how sweet , yeah .
lewis?
does he think he is tarzan , or what?
he knows the woods , though .
he really does .
not really .
he learned 'em , he doesn't feel 'em .
that's his problem .
he wants to be one with nature and he can't hack it .
this is a hell of a time to be tellin 'us that .
jesus !
lewis , you scared the shit out of me !
oh , who was it , lewis?
i don't know .
i thought i heard something .
something or someone?
i don't know .
good night , lewis .
good night , drew .
i'm goin 'to sleep .
night has fallen .
and there's nothin 'we can do about it .
i had my first wet dream in a sleepin 'bag .
how was it?
great .
there's no repeatin 'it .
never mind .
no matter what disaster may occur in other parts of the world ...
... or what petty little problems ... ... arise in atlanta ... ... no one can find us up here .
good night , lewis .
goddamn it !
hey , bobby , look what came out of the forest .
get a shot , ed?
hell , sometimes a man can ... ... hunt for three years ... ... never get a shot .
isn't that right , lewis?
right .
i don't understand how anyone could shoot an animal .
some people never can , drew .
i've known tournament archers , damn good shots .
never out of the five ring .
draw down on a live animal and they get buck fever .
what the hell's that?
loss of control , psychological .
who gives a shit?
you take that chubby boy with you today , okay?
hope we can get off this river today .
don't get too far ahead , now .
no , we'll be takin 'it slow .
easy , easy , my man .
i got eaten alive last night .
my bites have got bites .
i'm a salesman , ed .
good morning .
i'm not mad at you , ed .
just do me a favor , don't holler at me .
i'm not used to bein 'hollered at .
damn friend of yours screamed at me all day long yesterday .
paddle , you son of a bitch .
look !
what in the hell are lewis and drew doin 'up there anyway?
probably they're doin 'the same thing we are .
bobby?
how goes it?
what the hell you think you're doing?
headin 'downriver .
little canoe trip .
headin 'for aintry .
aintry?
sure , this river only runs one way , captain .
haven't you heard?
you ain't never gonna get down to aintry .
why not?
'cause .
this river don't go to aintry .
you done taken the wrong turn .
see , this here river don't go nowhere near aintry .
where does it go then?
boy , you are lost .
well , hell , i guess this river comes out somewhere , don't it?
that's where we're going , somewhere .
look , we don't want any trouble here .
if you gentlemen have a still near here , that's fine with us .
why sure .
we'd never tell anybody where it is .
you know something?
you're right , we're lost .
we don't know where in the hell we are .
a still?
right , yeah , you're makin 'whiskey up here .
we'll buy some .
we could use it .
do you know what you're talkin 'about?
we don't know what you're talking about .
you said something about makin 'whiskey .
ain't that what you said?
we don't know what you're doing , and we don't care .
that's none of our business .
that's right , none of your goddamn business .
we've got quite a long journey ahead of us , gentlemen
hold it .
you ain't going no damn where !
this is ridiculous .
excuse me .
hold it , or i'll blow your guts out all over these woods .
wait , we can talk this thing over .
what is it you require of us?
well , we require that you get your goddamn ass up in them woods .
all right , now , look .

you get up there now .
okay , all right .
get up there .
all right .
faster , boy .
move your ass .
easy with the weapon !
you shut up .

what's the trouble?
you're in trouble .
just don't argue with 'em , ed .
see that saplin 'over yonder?
you heard him .
back up against this .
is this a matter of money?
if we want money , we'll take it .
back up against the tree .
i'm pretty far back against it now .
now , stay just there .
now , be real still .
if he tries that again , shoot that one there .
i'ii blow his damned balls off .
you ain't a big boy .
be still now .
now let's you just drop them pants .
drop?
just take 'em right off !
i mean , what's this all about?
don't say anything , just do it .
just drop 'em , boy !
you ever had your balls cut off , you fuckin 'ape?

he got a real pretty mouth , ain't he?
that's the truth .
you're gonna do some prayin 'for me , boy .
and you better pray good .
here , hold that on him .
you better run , you son of a bitch !
can't we do anything for him?
no .
it's a center shot .
i thought they'd surely kill us .
they would have .
they would have for sure .
what we gonna do with him?
take the body down to aintry .
turn it over to the highway patrol .
tell 'em what happened .
tell 'em what , exactly?
just what happened .
this is justifiable homicide if anything is .
they were sexually assaulting two members of our party at gunpoint .
like you said , there was nothin 'else we could do .
is he alive?
not now .
well , let's get our heads together .
come on , let's not do anything foolish .
anybody know anything about the law?
i was on jury duty once .
it wasn't a murder trial .
murder trial?
you take this man and turn him over to the sheriff , there'll be a trial all right .
trial by jury .
so what?
we killed a man , drew .
shot him in the back .
a mountain man .
cracker .
gives us somethin 'to consider .
all right , consider it .
we're listening .
shit , all these people are related .
i'll be damned if i'll come back and stand trial ... ... with this man's aunt and uncle ... ... maybe his mama and his daddy sittin 'in the jury box .
what do you think , bobby?
how about you , ed?
i don't know .
i really don't know .
now you listen , lewis .
i don't know what you got in mind ... ... but if you conceal this body , you'll be charged with murder .
that much law i do know .
this ain't one of your fuckin 'games !
you killed somebody !
there he is !
i see him , drew .
that's right , i killed somebody .
but you're wrong if you don't see this as a game .
now you listen , ed !
damn it , we can get out of this thing !
without any questions asked !
we get connected up with that body and the law ... ... this thing's gonna be hangin 'over us the rest of our lives .
we gotta get rid of that guy .
just how are you gonna do that , lewis?
where?
anywhere .
everywhere .
nowhere .
how do you know that other guy hasn't already gone for the police?
what in the hell is he gonna tell 'em , drew?
what he did to bobby?
why couldn't he go get some other mountain men?
now why isn't he gonna do that?
you look around you , lewis !
he could be out there anywhere , watchin 'us right now .
we ain't gonna be so goddamned hard to follow , draggin 'a corpse .
you let me worry about that , drew .
you let me take care of that .
you know what's gonna be here?
right here .
a lake .
as far as you can see .
hundreds of feet deep .
hundreds of feet deep .
did you ever look over a lake ... ... and think about somethin 'buried underneath it?
buried underneath it !
man , that's about as buried as you can get !
well , i am telling you , lewis , i don't want any part of it .
well , you are part of it !
it is a matter of the iaw !
the law?
the law?
what law?
where's the law , drew?
you believe in democracy , don't you?
yes , i do .
well , then , we'll take a vote .
i'ii stand by it .
so will you .
what do you say , bobby?
let's bury him .
i don't want this gettin 'around .
okay?
okay?
it's up to you , ed .
it's all up to you , ed .
now just think what you're doin ', ed .
for god's sake .
you got a wife .
you got a child .
you're not involved in this .
think about your family , ed .
this may be the most important decision of your whole life , ed .
yes !
there's no way we can change this .
there's no way we can change what happened to bobby .
we gotta do the right thing .
we must live with it for the rest of our lives .
right !
i'm with lewis .
all right , let's get on with it , then .
lewis .
let's go .
what's the plan , lewis?

drew was shot .
lewis says that other guy ... ... that toothless bastard , shot him !
he's right up there !
he's gonna try and kill us , too !
if he killed drew ... ... he's gonna have to kill us !
lewis , i'll tell you what .
we'll wait until dark , and we'll put you in the bottom of the canoe ... ... and we'll sneak out of here .
okay , ed?
bobby , look at those rapids down there !
look at those rapids !
christ !
we can't move out of here in the dark .
we're not gonna move you , lewis .
lewis , we're trapped in this gorge .
what're we gonna do , lewis?
you're the guy with the answers .
what the hell do we do now?
now you get to play the game .
you're ruined !
lewis , you're ruined !
listen .
he's hurt bad , isn't he?
what're we gonna do?
the guy must know exactly where we are .
well , if he knows where we are ... ... then we sure as hell know where he's gonna be .
right up there .
christ !

goddamn it !
you'll never get out of this gorge alive !
goddamn it !
pull yourself together .

i don't believe it !
you did it , ed .

that's the guy with the gun , huh?
i think so .
he wasn't just some guy ...
... up there huntin 'or something?
you tell me !
was he shot?
what about here?
what about right there?
could have been a rock .
what are you gonna do with drew?
if a bullet made this , there are people who can tell .
oh , god !
there's no end to it .
i didn't really know him .
drew was ... ... a good husband ... ... to his wife linda .
you're a wonderful father to your boys , drew ... ... jimmy and billy ray .
and if ... ... we come through this , i promise ... ... to do all i can for 'em .
he was the best of us .
amen .

and drew drowned here .
in this place .
no , no , ed .

bobby , listen to me !
we got to stop them from lookin 'upriver .
it's important that we get together on this thing .

that's our story .
lewis , we're back .
it's all right .

drew ballinger .
did you look for him?
a long time .
could you show us where it happened?
how'd you manage to shoot yourself with your own arrow?
didn't think it could be done .
this is nice .
what's that?
chromium , paper tissues ... ... hot water ...
that's nice .
you fallin 'asleep?
don't forget to phone your wife .
let her know how you are .

twelve and a half inches long .
then i measured it around , and it's ten and a half around .

i think you're crazy sometimes .
we can show you the place .
now i know where you told me it was .

that could be it .
but you ain't sure?
yeah , i think so , but it's kind of confusing .
i'd think you'd recognize your own canoe .
i'd appreciate it if you'd show me that spot .
ed , we're in trouble .
they don't believe us !
what did you tell him , bobby?
what we agreed on .
i heard you .
i was in that room , bobby .
what did you tell him?
they found part of the green canoe , right?
upstream , and you got scared .
didn't you , bobby?
i know you .
you told him the truth , didn't you , bobby?
you told him the truth !
i didn't do that !
i told 'em ... ... iike we said .
but i don't think they believed me .
ed , i think they found that other canoe ... ... upstream , above where we told him .
i never said that .
yes , you did .
no , i didn't .
i know damn well you did .
i know what i said .
yeah , well , that's a goddamn lie .
sheriff , that ain't what he said this morning .
you tell me how a canoe can drift upriver .
now what about this?

i don't know what's wrong with your man there .
mr. queen's got a brother in law ... ... back up in there somewhere .
he took off huntin 'three days ago and ... ... nobody's heard from him since .
mr. queen thought maybe you all ... ... might've happened up on him somewhere .
well , we didn't .
don't let 'em go .
these boys is lying .
we got nothin 'to hold 'em for .
we don't have a thing .
let's just wait and see what comes out of the river .
that there's the town hall .
right over there's the old fire station .
played a lot of checkers over there .
all this land's gonna be covered with water .
best thing that ever happened to this town .
we may have to stop just a minute for the church to get out of the way .
christ .
doctor , how's our boy?
we're doin 'everything we can for him .
but there's a chance he might lose the leg , so take it easy on him , okay?
i'ii talk with you iater .
officer?
has he been awake yet?
no , we're still waitin 'for him to come around .
lewis , listen , we had to change our story .

there was someone , wasn't there?
i think so , yes .
before you go , buddy , let me ask you something .

well , how come he wasn't wearin 'it?
i don't know .

don't come back up here .
you don't have to worry about that , sheriff .
i'd kinda iike to see this town die peaceful .
i hope deputy queen finds his brother in law .
he'ii come in drunk probably .
good bye , ed .
