he's over there !
he's this way !
this way !
this way !
hurry up !
hello?
it's clark stevens from farley university .
hello?
i'm looking for dr. franks .
excuse me , do you know where i can find dr. franks?
it doesn't like it when you say that !
and it doesn't like you !
leave him alone .
can't you tell he doesn't like you touching him like that?
it doesn't like it when you say that .
and it doesn't like you either , puddles !
it's too fucking bad !
that's enough , puddles .
i'm dr. hendricks .
clark stevens .
welcome to cunningham hall .
thank you very much .
i hope you don't mind i let myself in .
no , we've been expecting you .
well , my train ran a little late .
and it's hard to find a cab to take you out here .
yet here you are .
yes , here i am .
we should probably begin with a series of psychiatric tests ... to make sure we start with a clean bill of mental health ...
followed by a thorough physical .
betty .
mr. franklin .
what did we talk about when we said no more pretending we're a doctor?
but , but i was ...
i know , mr. franklin .
why don't you go back in the rec room and make yourself at home?
nurse hendricks is going to serve pudding pops .
won't that be nice?
very nice .
good boy !
it was nice to meet you .
hi .
i'm betty donner .
clark stevens .
i'm the administration coordinator .
i'm sorry i missed you up front .
i just stepped away for a moment .
don't worry about it .
i'm glad to finally meet you .
same here .
we are so excited about your coming in to lend us a hand .
i'm excited about getting to work .
wonderful .
wonderful .
perfect .
i'll have your badge ready for you in a few days .
i need you to fill out these forms ... so you get school credit .
blue card on the bottom's for emergency information .
your keys to the kingdom .
thank you .
and your walkie talkie .
that's how we communicate here .
you'll stay in a cottage on the south side of the building .
well , there's only one thing left .
what's that?
to meet the big cheese .
dr. franks .
very good .
hello , betty .
i take it this place has been around for a while .
since 1918 .
you should have seen the shape it was before we spruced it all up .
it took our patient clean up committee ... a year and a half to get it to this point .
they've done such a marvelous job .
absolutely .
no , i'm sure .
it's just ...
it seems a little rundown .
not particularly conducive to rehabilitation .
for some of the patients , that will never happen .
get me out of here .
carl !
i shouldn't be here !
no one should .
carl ...
it's okay .
they don't let you go home even when they know you're better .
why do you say that?
because the people running this place ... are really the crazy ones .
guilty as charged .
now run along .
go on , scoot !
have a seat .
the doctor will be with you momentarily .
good luck .
thank you very much , betty .
'einstein also believed ... some chronic schizophrenics were ... misdiagnosed due to possible psychokinetic conditions ... such as their ability to see paranormal activities . '
not a pleasant way to receive mental health treatment .
i received your records from the university .
4 . 0 average .
my , my .
you have the potential to follow in your grandfather's footsteps .
thank you .
i hope so .
my internship here is all i need to get my degree .
then what?
well ... to take residence in a mental health facility as a counselor .
that goes without saying .
what's going on with these?
put them in a cup , polly .
sorry , dr. franks .
my minor , sir , is in administrations .
i'd love to work in a place like cunningham hall .
maybe design an updated curriculum .
i researched the building and its operating procedures .
i made notes .
little changes we might implement ... during my stay .
mr. stevens ...
i hope you understand what you've gotten yourself into here .
i'm sorry?
this isn't a summer camp .
we have neither funding nor time for anything but patient maintenance .
i absolutely understand that has to be the priority , but ...
you want to empty bedpans to make your grades better ... great .
but you're not in class ... reading about life in a mental institute .
you've arrived .
i didn't mean any disrespect .
i just thought ...
let me be blunt .
you're not here to think .
if you want to be on my staff , i want you to focus on the objective .
that is?
maintenance of the mentally ill .
make no mistake .
there are serious reasons why ... a person would be locked up in here .
where is this wonder boy i have heard so much about?
dr. morton , dr. douglas .
clark stevens .
nice to meet you .
it is you .
i'd recognize you anywhere .
i met your grandfather ... at the chicago conference of mental health sciences in '75 .
he and i went on such a bender ...
i was discussing our operating procedures with mr. stevens .
we've come to an understanding .
introduce him to sara , then she can give him the grand tour .
i like to give my favorites a little extra .
you never know when you might need a little favor .
noted .
so you survived the franks interview .
yes .
just barely .
some say it's the worst ... shock treatment the hospital offers .
i can't argue with that .
he's kind of a shark , the bottom line's if you work hard ... he'll hire you full time .
that's what he did with me .
i would just ideally love to help change this place .
improve it a bit .
that's what we all say ... until the third time you're stabbed with a pencil .
point taken .
when did you start working here?
last year .
i served the same internship you did .
so you graduated last year?
you're a year older than me .
which means you have to do everything i say .
come on .
i'll be your tour guide today .
this is b ward .
group therapy's in there .
showers , med station .
we keep it locked for obvious reasons .
also we keep some low security risk patients here .
ladies 'rooms .
your duties will range from monitoring patients ... sitting on group therapy sessions ... to assisting staff .
speaking of which , brace yourself .
nurse hendricks .
sara .
you must be clark .
yes , indeed .
nice to meet you .
he's the new intern .
of course he is .
i'm anabelle hendricks , head nurse .
pleasure .
i wondered where you went to .
seems to be a regular occurrence lately .
i'm sorry , i haven't been feeling well .
you'll assist nurse hendricks as well as other staff .
i look forward to it .
so do i.
it will be nice to have a little muscle here .
may i speak with you in the office , please?
sure .
he's been up there ... for months .
who has?
we need to change the prescription .
i signed off on everything .
you need to be there at precisely ...
sara?
do you understand?
ready for more?
sure .
enjoy your stay here , clark .
thank you very much .
what a bitch .
come on .
that's crystal .
she's our resident nymphomaniac .
come on .
where are we going?
to the unpleasant part of this job .
where we keep high risk patients .
you won't often be asked to come down here .
trust me , it's a good thing .
what is it?
housing for potential murderers , lunatics ...
your everyday garden variety maniacs .
that sounds interesting .
look ... this is where they tuck away people everyone wants to forget .
the ones you never hear about .
unless they have the chance to act on their natural instinct .
which is?
to rip you limb from limb .
welcome to the madhouse .
after you .
wallace .
hey , sugar .
they been asking for you all day .
this is clark .
he'll be with us for a while .
my condolences .
here you go .
he's going to need your belt .
here's the drill .
stay behind the yellow line at all times .
if you need help ... push the alarm at the end of the hall .
i need your pen ... and any other sharp objects on you .
they can't get out , can they?
that's what they keep telling me .
nice to meet you .
ready for this?
sure .
i've volunteered in a couple of hospitals before .
i can't believe they keep patients down here .
run into that on your volunteer work?
let me out .
i have something for you .
where are you going?
where are you going?
you are not going to leave me down here !
get back here and hook a sister up !
severe obsessive compulsive disorder .
she has to do everything in sets of nine .
including the doses of strychnine ... she gave her preschool class .
paranoid?
homicidal .
sara !
sara !
sara , help !
no , it's okay .
it's okay .
drake !
royce is at it again .
can you bring his meds down?
royce , calm down !
it will be fine .
drake's on his way with your meds .
god !
sara !
let go !
let go !
drake !
it's all right .
he didn't hurt me !
drake !
he didn't hurt us .
let's hope he gets it right next time .
here , big guy .
thanks , kid .
i owe you one .
let's get out of here .
betty , this is wallace .
i'm heading home .
drake is here .
dottie's got a roast waiting that has my name all over it .
that's a big 10 4 , wallace .
you have a nice evening .
over .
10 4 , betty .
you , too .
over and out .
hello?
hey , i saw you .
why don't you come out and introduce yourself?
drake , are you still here?
i could use help .
i have a situation in the rec room .
once again , alice ... are you going to do what your caretaker is requesting of you?
you're hurting my arm !
i'm trying to make sure you don't hurt yourself .
take your pills if you want to get better .
doesn't that make sense , sweetheart?
i'm going to ask that you take your medication ... or i'm afraid i'll have to resort to disciplinary measures .
he'll watch when you are sleeping .
do we have an understanding?
do you think i enjoy hurting you like this?
that medicine don't work on me !
alice !
stop !
bite your tongue , carl !
you're hurting her !
get away from me , you faggot !
it's okay .
drake !
you get back !
it's late for you , isn't it?
it wants me to go to sleep now .
let's go .
kid !
unbelievable .
i saw you come down here .
why don't you come out?
hey , kid , come on .
this isn't a good place to be .
you could get ... hurt .
safety alarm at the end of the hall .
jesus !
there's no one in there .
dr. morton , how long have you worked here?
i've worked here for 27 years .
that's a long time .
you have no idea .
that were you doing down there after hours?
i followed the little boy .
that kid running around .
he broke into my room .
i chased him to see who he was .
it's strange that he runs around here at night .
i guess the whole place is a little strange
occupational hazard .
i guess so .
that noise i keep hearing , what is that?
it sounds like it comes from the basement .
i figured it was the water pipes?
maybe .
well , what is it?
it's an old building .
it can be a variety of things .
but ...
buildings are like people .
they remember everything that happened to them through time .
sometimes ... they don't like what they remember .
what do you mean?
a while back ... we had a patient down in cell 44 .
he was the saddest sickest subject i've ever come across .
one night he ... dug himself out ... but he got turned around and couldn't find his way .
what happened?
he jumped out a third story window .
did he die?
some say he died when he hit the ground .
some say they caught him and locked him back up .
but i ...
i believe he's still here ... trying to dig his way out and go home .
you believe that?
either that or he came back to run this place .
mr. stevens ...
i have a wet cleanup in the tv room .
if you're not too busy , perhaps you could mop it up?
sure .
sneaking around ...
leaving maximum security open .
you've had quite a first night , mr. stevens .
i wasn't sneaking around .
speak to me .
nurse hendricks called for help over the radio and i came .
and?
and i got to the rec room and realized she didn't need help ... being that she was using a taser on a patient .
some patients have to be constantly reminded ... who has the upper hand .
refusing to take medication doesn't warrant an electrical burn .
stevens ...
this place is a mess .
it's dirty , it's unsafe , it's understaffed .
are you aware there are children running around here at night?
no one gets in or out without my authorization .
what about the patient that escaped from the basement?
dr. morton told me about ... a patient who escaped .
dr. morton doesn't know what he's talking about .
look , let's start over again , all right?
while it's no secret this place could use fixing up ... most of the patients housed here are content .
you know why?
they have no place else to go .
i'll make you a deal .
stick to the rules , mind your own business .
i'll consider some of the suggestions you put together .
are we in agreement , mr. stevens?
fine .
well , hello there , busy bee .
good morning .
what are you trying to pull here?
i have no idea what you're talking about .
albert , things will change here ... or i'm placing a call to the board .
i know what you are up to .
hey , new guy !
hey there .
what are you doing?
what are you doing?
i'm on my way back to my room .
do you want to sit in on an obsessive compulsive group ... at 3 : 30?
it's my own little session .
it sounds great , really ...
but , i don't want to get into any more hot water .
why , what's wrong?
nothing .
i was in frank's office and i saw something weird .
he has a lot of weird books .
one , in particular on his desk ... he put it away when he realized i saw it .
are you sure you're not a private detective disguised as an intern?
i'm a dork?
you're a dork .
the guy reads weird books .
maybe he's learning about his bedside manner .
sara , to the nurses 'station , please .
copy .
got to go .
good luck .
good night , nurse hendricks .
everyone in bed?
all tucked in .
i'm almost done .
if you don't need anything i'll go lay down .
i'll check it out .
is there something we can help you with?
it's bedtime !
i don't have time for foolishness !
come out and show yourself .
i don't have time to waste and i don't want to hurt you .
who are you?
you are only hurting yourself .
well ...
i suppose if you aren't going to come out ... you'll have to make yourself cozy until drake arrives .
he'll find a way to convince you to go back to your room .
stop !
why are you doing this?
stop !
i know you're all devastated by what happened .
i want to know which patient did this and i want to know by tonight .
betty will assign each of you a section .
i want you to interview the residents .
they trust you .
i want you to use that trust .
keep the authorities out , or the patients will give you nothing .
then we will thoroughly review the security and safety protocol .
let's get going .
roger that .
i can't believe this happened .
i worked with her for 25 years .
she was such a nice lady .
dr. morton?
get dr. shores , take the west wing .
everything's okay .
dr. douglas said she was with you before it happened .
did you see anyone?
we heard someone in the hall ... and she went to check it out .
then i heard loud music and i ...
they think a patient did it?
clark !
you and drake are in the basement .
don't be afraid , clarkie .
i'll protect you .
all right .
i have to go .
yeah , sure .
we didn't see ...
anything .
we were sleeping .
our door is locked .
tight as a drum .
are you dating sara?
if you remember anything , let me know .
i'll kill you , you freak !
i'll make sure you rot there the rest of your life !
what's wrong?
i'll teach this freak to show respect .
take a break .
i'm almost done here .
i'll be out in a minute .
why don't you come inside and i'll make us a remy martins?
it's the ones who protest too much ... that end up wearing their wives 'panties !
why won't you talk to me?
it might help you sort things out .
how does it feel to be convinced something is there ... when logic tells you it's not?
i thought i was hearing things .
now you know what madness feels like .
that's a feeling you'll never forget .
why are you sitting in the dark?
lilumination only reminds me of what i've become .
what's your name?
that's a subjective question .
there was a problem here last night .
so we're taking time with each resident ... asking them if they heard or saw anything unusual .
funny you'd ask a madman ... if he's seen anything unusual .
all right , thank you .
pretty strange place , this cunningham hall .
how so?
bad things going down here .
but you know that .
what kind of bad things?
take that sick individual lurking around , for instance .
someone who's comforted by the warmth of fresh blood .
who do you think it is?
you're a smart boy , you'll figure it out .
is it you?
the top of the food chain would be a good place to start looking .
are you speaking of dr. franks?
they're cell numbers on a prescription to me .
go to betty or wallace to find out who the hell they are .
they wouldn't know their own names if you asked them .
can you tell me what the patient in cell 44 was diagnosed with?
i just keep them doped up .
do you know what medication he's on?
you sure have a lot of questions .
risperdex .
that's what they're all on down there .
an antidepressant .
have you seen the place?
thank you , grace .
you're breaking rule number one ... about working in a place like this .
what's that?
taking what the patients say seriously .
i'm not .
believe me , i'm not .
i did hear hendricks and franks arguing ... the night she got killed .
you have to understand these patients are totally delusional .
they'll tell you things they actually believe to be true .
but hardcore schizophrenics in particular can't be trusted .
take what they say with a grain of salt .
i understand that .
it just seemed weird .
he was being cryptic .
they're paranoid .
they have it out for franks because he's keeping them locked in here .
you're reading too much into this conversation .
you can never trust a schizo .
why are all the patients in the basement ... on the same medication?
because i'm sure they're keeping them seriously tranquilized .
i used to love to play outside this time of day .
me and my friends .
we played kick the can ... sometimes dodge ball .
i was good at that .
too afraid of getting hit by the ball , i guess .
then one day things started to go bad .
how so?
i started seeing stuff .
stuff before it happened .
one day my parents dropped me off here to have some tests run .
and they never came back .
that's a rough thing to carry with you .
you can try to steer your life in the direction you want , but ... everything happens as it's meant to be .
maybe so .
i think you're not meant to be here anymore .
you're right .
but the day i leave here ... will be the day that i'm dead .
that's one of the bad things about knowing stuff before it happens .
my little problem ... stems from the fact ...
i was never allowed to get in touch with my inner child .
i'm a vulnerable child ... trapped inside an adult's body .
and wearing an adult diaper .
up yours , jimmy !
okay , calm down .
look , we're all grieving right now .
some of us feel vulnerable ... or depressed .
or scared .
that's right , alice .
what makes you feel scared?
it won't stop scaring me .
what won't?
i try to close my eyes , make it go away .
it's always right there , watching me .
what is this 'it 'that you're referring to?
the ghost .
what ghost?
the one that runs through the house at night .
it's always watching me through the windows .
what does it want from you?
to make sure that i never forget what madness feels like .
it's betty .
did i awake you?
not at all .
i was just getting up .
great .
i wanted you to know your badge is ready .
dr. franks wants to know if you had anything to report ... from yesterday's interviews .
i've still got one more patient i'd love to talk to down there ... but it seems like they were all in their cells .
drake checked the locks and it didn't appear they could get out .
just keep me posted .
i've got to type up ... the findings and give them to the investigator .
okay .
fantastic .
so nice of you to come down .
we seldom get visitors down here in our little pit of despair .
why did you stop talking to me last time i was down here?
i'd run out of things to say .
why don't you come into the light where i can see you?
come on , we're friends by now .
let's just say i suffered a slight disfigurement as a child .
since then , i choose to live in the shadows .
all right , then .
can you get out of this cell?
only if someone lets me .
no more talking in circles .
answer the question .
are you wondering if that little boy you keep seeing ... is somehow getting the keys and letting me out?
what little boy?
now who's talking in circles?
clark , i've got sara on line one out here .
i'll be right up .
we'll continue this conversation later?
you can call me ben .
we have to stop meeting like this .
what will the patients say?
i think it's a little late for that .
so , did you finish up your interviews?
basically .
what are you taking?
oh , i have a cold .
i interviewed all the patients that i was assigned to .
their stories were out there .
mine too .
mrs. idelson told me that the guy from 'wheel of fortune 'did it .
that's possible .
i had one guy , he's interesting ... but i don't think he knows anything .
sic franks on him .
let the cops do the rest .
hang on , i forgot a fork .
what are you doing?
i'm sorry .
they were sticking out of your purse .
some cold , huh?
why you taking risperdex?
here goes .
when i was a little girl i had problems focusing ... and i was later diagnosed with really minor schizophrenia .
but i got put on risperdex and it leveled me out .
i haven't really had any symptoms since i was a kid .
is that how you got interested in mental health?
still want to be my friend?
sure .
crazy chicks are wild .
you jerk .
i'm kidding .
you're all right now?
yeah , yeah , i'm fine .
look , don't tell anyone .
i won't .
those pills are red .
so?
the risperdex grace showed me , the pills were blue .
i'm sure a bunch of psychos are on a much stronger dose than i am .
this is the only way out , sara !
carl finally got to go home .
please go to your rooms !
ghosts .
would somebody get dr. franks on the radio !
what happened?
i was bringing in the games .
we were going to play chutes 'n 'ladders , then this .
maybe he hated chutes 'n 'ladders .
did you see him talking to anyone before he came in?
he went out to get his medication .
what was he given?
an antidepressant?
grace !
was carl just here?
half hour ago .
did you see him talking to anybody?
other than himself?
no .
what did you give him?
what i always do .
are we starting with q& a again?
because i don't have time .
grace , i'm sorry , what did you give him?
i gave him his usual dose of happy tabs .
thank you .
ben !
i haven't gone anywhere .
you said something about the medication they gave you .
does it help?
i wouldn't know .
i don't take it .
but i do have a nice mosaic on the wall ...
i've done with my unused pills .
but , ben , why don't you take it?
they wouldn't help me if i did .
why not?
a hospital is a place of business .
when people get better ... there are less bodies in bed .
doesn't that make sense?
they give patients weak medication to keep them sick?
look around you .
the loonies here only seem to get worse .
take your friend carl , for instance .
he took his meds , like a good boy .
and look what happened to him .
how do you know about carl?
did i say something happened to him?
i can't believe you talked me into this .
i need to check out the med station .
i'll be out in 3 minutes .
here they are !
hurry .
let's get out of here .
why are we doing this?
i'll send the pills to a friend who works at the university hospital .
i figured whoever's doing this is on the wrong medication .
look , carl was ready to go home .
according to grace , he was on a huge dose of tranquilizers .
he shouldn't have been able to get out of bed ... much less hang himself .
what?
you're cute when you're sleuthing .
good night .
good night .
sara?
there is no place like home .
if franks finds out we're in his office , we're screwed .
it was a little boy .
i've been seeing him since i got here .
at first i thought it was one of the gardener's kids .
what?
you're sure he isn't?
no way .
look ...
i know this sounds strange .
but i think this place actually might be haunted .
i wouldn't believe it if i hadn't seen it myself .
but i think alice saw something , and franks , too .
why else would he have these books?
what?
it's just between your theories on the medication , and franks .
now you're seeing ghosts?
maybe your surroundings are affecting you .
i'm not crazy , sara .
he was right outside my window .
he looked right at me .
believe me .
okay , okay , i do .
where do they keep the patient records?
the nurses 'station .
come on .
get your hands off me !
i didn't kill that bitch !
there's something you ought to understand .
nothing goes on here that i don't know or hear about .
then you know that i'll be back for you .
and you , snitch !
you're next .
i'm going to skin you alive !
nobody's safe here !
muzzle him .
nobody's safe !
that poor , troubled boy .
i heard he was raised in a carnival .
now we know where the narcotics disappeared to .
what happened?
they're questioning him regarding nurse hendricks 'death .
franks found her taser in his things .
they also found out he had relations with a patient .
who are you?
clark , you're there?
i'm sorry , yes , this is he .
this is tom , from the lab .
hi , tom .
there is no narcotics in the drugs that you gave me .
what?
just placebos .
all right .
thank you for looking into that .
you were right about the medication .
the risperdex they dispense here is just a placebo .
taking matters into our own hands?
very aggressive .
i'll call the board first thing monday morning .
one patient is going into psychoses ... and acting out because he's not getting his meds .
i wouldn't tell anyone about our discovery until then .
you wouldn't want franks to cover up their dirty work .
they arrested drake today ... and i don't think he did it .
i heard hendricks arguing with franks the day she died .
i think he's connected and she knew about it .
they say the obvious answer usually is the answer .
it's in front of your eyes .
you have to be willing to see it .
how do you know about everything going on here?
i'm smart .
be honest with me .
can you get out of this cell?
let me go out , too !
why do you get out and i don't?
only in my mind , royce .
only in my mind .
tell me about the ghost of the little boy .
he's showing up everywhere now .
he must be fond of you .
you've got work to do .
you'd better get back upstairs before you miss any more action .
admittance , diagnosis , release dates .
here's everything you need .
this is amazing .
great job .
check this out .
here are patients that were rehabbed and released ... since franks took over .
how many?
none .
none?
this is unbelievable .
this proves that he keeps patients sick so they can't go home .
ben london .
cell 44 , schizophrenic , died in 1989?
so?
so he's not dead .
i talked to him this morning .
you're losing me .
dr. morton told me about a patient who escaped from cell 44 years ago .
maybe ben was the one who escaped .
and franks tried to cover it up by ... saying he died .
when they got around to catching and bringing him back ...
they never bothered to take him off the deceased list .
exactly .
what are you thinking?
i don't know .
you have to be thinking about something .
you can tell me .
we're in this together .
perfect .
kitchen's closed !
let me see ... peaches ... gravy , pudding ... meatloaf !
just what the doctor ordered .
pickles?
pickles .
ketchup .
ketchup , ketchup , ketchup , ketchup , ketchup .
got you !
who are you?
it's clark .
what did you do to me?
where am i?
what's happening to me?
it's okay .
sara , look at me .
i work with you at the hospital .
do you remember?
look , i think you forgot to take your medication .
take a couple of these and it will be better .
i'm sorry .
it's okay .
i just can't figure out ... what's real and what's a dream .
come on .
come here .
all right .
... coming to the area late today ... bringing along chances of thunderstorm and low temperatures .
and now , for more informations on our top story ...
lets go back to peter garcia .
sheriff johnson warns that the escaped suspect ... who was detained on suspicion of murder ... should be considered armed and dangerous .
he's known to go by the alias of drake anderson .
anderson is 5 foot 10 , has dark brown hair ... and sports the tattoo of a spider on his neck .
anyone with information leading to his capture ... should report it to the kirkside sheriff's department .
what happened?
thank god you're okay .
someone killed dr. morton .
what?
i'm scared .
i don't know who to trust anymore .
drake got out .
what?
i heard it on the radio .
he escaped last night .
if it was him , then he's probably long gone .
they searched this whole place with a fine tooth comb .
that investigator wants to ask us a few questions .
not now .
i'm going to talk to franks .
what?
i'm going to talk to franks !
open the goddamn door !
franks , i know you're in there !
open the door !
jesus !
it isn't drake .
what are you talking about?
i asked the cops and they said he was arrested 20 minutes ago .
he stole a car in dallas .
i'm leaving .
wait , wait .
i don't know what's going on here .
come with me if you want , but i'm not staying .
okay .
okay .
wait , i'll go .
come with me to the office and i'll grab a few things .
come on .
i want to be sure security ... can keep the patients locked down .
they won't be safe here .
nobody will be safe here .
i'll tell betty we're going .
fine .
but make it quick .
i want to get as far away as possible .
i will .
we'll be okay .
nothing will happen with all those cops hanging outside .
here .
what if it's not a person doing all this?
what do you mean?
what if it's like morton said?
what if something happened in the building ... and it's never forgotten?
clark ... it was a person .
and if it was a patient , they're all in lockdown .
we're fine .
now go back .
i'll just finish up around here .
it's right in front of your eyes .
clark , are you there?
right in front of your eyes .
i just can't figure out ... what's real and what's a dream .
i was diagnosed with schizophrenia .
sara .
thanks for your help , officer .
also , i have a list of patients .
i'll leave it in a red folder in my outbox .
not a problem .
you have my cell number .
okay , all right , thank you .
why did you drug me?
i just gave you a calmative .
you were acting really strange .
it was you .
i should've figured it out the other night when you had ... your relapse .
you're wrong .
ben told me the answer was right in front of my eyes .
who?
cell 44 .
ben london .
he must have seen you the night you killed nurse hendricks .
that's why he told me the answer was right in front of my eyes .
there's no one in cell 44 .
don't lie to me .
it's used for storage .
you were the one who told me ... never to trust a schizo .
i can prove he's there .
there you are .
i've been looking for you .
is something wrong?
ben !
ben !
ben , what's going on?
why didn't you tell me it was sara?
i'm going to let you out of here .
so you can get someplace safe .
but i want to see your face .
i suppose it's time to go home .
that kid i keep seeing running around the halls?
it's a little strange that he runs around here at night .
maybe your surroundings are starting to affect you .
i'm not crazy , sara .
now you know what madness feels like .
that's a feeling you'll never forget .
hey , good looking .
we've got work to do .
boys are not toys , les !
he was the sickest patient that i ever come across .
there you are .
i've been looking for you .
you need to teach you some respect !
what i'd love to do is change this place for the better .
that's really why i came here .
betty , go to one .
have my car sent around .
where are my keys to the medication?
never mind .
'this letter is in regards ... to the tuition fees for clark stevens 'internship .

hi , dr. franks .
you !
clark , have you lost your mind?
it's ben !

ben london .
do you remember me , al?

the one that you and hendricks ... and all the others never once tried to help .
ben london .
listen , i can help you .
it's too late for that now !
help !
hello?
i'm at cunningham hall .
i'm in the basement .
there are cops outside .
help me !
come on , sara .
you're as screwed up as i am .
we belong together .
come on , darling .
get up out of the corner .
you're making me crazy .
i didn't do anything .
i know .
it's just that ...
i came back to this place ... to get rid of memories i had here .
unfortunately , you're now one of them .
but i'm just like you .
i'm so sorry ... but i can't leave any loose ends .
ben , i can protect you .
i found your file .
i took it ... and i'm keeping it safe for you .
where?
we can both go away .
they won't even know you were here .
clark .
clark's not here , anymore .
clark doesn't even exist .
