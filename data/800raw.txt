makuta .
gathered friends ,
iisten again to our legend of the bionicle .
in the time before time , six mighty toa vanquished the makuta , encasing him in protodermis held tight by the force of their combined elemental powers .
before becoming turaga , the toa united in a dutiful pledge to rescue the matoran who were imprisoned by the makuta , and so they returned to their once glorious home with every intention of enacting a great rescue .
but makuta had not left the sleeping matoran unprotected .
their resting place was guarded by a ruthless king , a horde of poisoners , and a malevolent queen .
and nowthe nobletoa must face a web of shadows .
well , that stunk .
it would appear there was an error in our transport .
pilot error .
hey , i was only order taking .
vakama was the one order giving .
no need to be critical , matau .
regardless of how gracefully , we made it here .
whatever .
hey , could somebody dig me up?
there you go .
oh , thanks .
it's what i do .
arewegoingtostand around all night?
or are we going to rescue the matoran?
whoa !
what's with all the webs?
not exactly encouraging my toa hero spirit .
huh?
what is that all about?
hey !
what was that?
well , there goes the old neighbourhood .
the archive must have been breached .
what did you have in there?
everything ...
most of it dangerous .
rahi?
the onu metru archive houses a specimen of every rahi beast ever discovered .
atleast itusedto
and the webs?
visorak .
nasty creatures .
coming from you , that's not good .
but what does it change?
nothing .
we go to the coliseum , we rescue the matoran , we leave .
or get pulverised .
it is a possibility .
we've faced the makuta and won .
i really doubt a few crusty relics are going to give us much trouble .
agreed?
if you think we should .
follow me .
what the ...?
can't move !
can't ... stop !
this is gonna hurt .
is everyone ok?
yeah , we're right behind you , fearless leader .
literally .
bickering won't get us out of this , matau .
no , but think talking before charging straight into a trap might have .
if you have something to say , matau , say it .
forget it !
oh !
what's that?
we'll soon find out .
let me guess .
visorak?
yeah .
or , in their tongue , " the stealers of life " .
do they even have tongues?
all i see are teeth .
vakama , what do we do?
kollorak , it's nothing important , i hope , seeing as you're late .
this had better be good .
toa?
so , they've returned for the matoran
matoran that now belong to me .
i assume your telling me this without twitching uncontrollably means the toa have already been captured .
drop them .
is it to be so simple , sidorak?
roodaka , my queen .
no , not your queen .
not yet .
oh , of course .
formalities .
you have something to say?
only that leaders are judged in time by the quality of their enemies .
history teaches us this .
the toa?
a fantastic adversary , my king , worthy of your rule , and therefore a demise that will be remembered and spoken about for all time .
i suppose i could allow the situation to become a little more ...
iegendary .
i have always admired your judgement .
only , be sure your method allows some proof for posterity's sake .
proof?
bring me their bodies .
that's encouraging .
well , fire spitter , we can't say you didn't show us the city .
course , we can say that you got us captured , poisoned , and , seeing as i don't think we've been brought up here for the view , imminently smash dashed .
he agrees .
this is not vakama's fault .
huh !
i tried to lead you as best i could .
i wish i was better at it .
but if i've learned one thing from all we've been through , i am what i am .
and no matterhowmuch i mightwantto
i can't just change .
watch it !
whoa !
hey !
hey !
nokama !
help !
vakama !
i'm sorry i let you all down ... again .
whoa !
hey !
you better not scratch my armour !
what's happened to me?
answer me !
i am a toa !
not exactly .
rest , my makuta .
sleep , and know that as you do ,
i draw close to waking you .
what happened?
where is everybody?
hello?
hello?
darn vakama .
why'd we ever listen to him?
i can't believe it .
yikes !
no , no .
this isn't me .
i can't be ugly .
oh , just relax .
just relax .
it's me .
it's me .
come on !
stand back !
would you calm down?
i'm dangerous , i'm ugly , and i'll hurt you .
it's all right , matau .
nokama?
matau , it's all right .
all right?
you call this " all right "?
we're all here .
we'll find a way .
together .
cos that's what friends do .
he's right .
i don't hear you saying that , smelt head .
what's the matter?
too busy cooking up another master plan?
i'm through making plans .
well , that's the first good thing i've heard since i've been hideous .
regardless of how we look , it might be better if we use our energy to find out why we've become whatever it is we are .
yes , the sooner we do that , the sooner we can rescue the matoran .
and how are we gonna do that when we're the ones who need saving?
if you are wise , if you wish to be your old selves again , you will listen .
the toa have returned , as you said they would .
even now , their broken bodies are being brought to me so i may drain them of their elemental powers powers i will use to shatter the wretched seal that keeps us apart .
and then there will be no need for a worthless ruler like sidorak , who would wash his hands of conflict rather than dirty them with it .
together , you and i will teach the sleeping matoran to obey your will .
what is it?
the toa?
why do you speak of them as if they're still alive?
rahaga?
we can't rescue the matoran .
why are we here?
brothers , we must be patient .
keetongu .
the key to nongu?
keetongu is a most honourable creature , and skilled in the ways of venoms , not to mention our only hope to stand against the visorak horde .
if you are to be the toa you once were , it is keetongu you must seek .
but what are we now?
hordika venom courses within you .
if it is not neutralised , it will take root , and hordika you will be forever .
like you?
i am a rahaga .
norik is my name .
andthis isgaaki ,
bomonga ,
kualus ,
pouks ...
and lruini .
rahaga , can you take us to this keetongu?
iruini !
i don't understand .
what lruini so inappropriately suggests is that this will be difficult .
we rahaga have come to metru nui in search of keetongu ourselves .
there are those that , well , doubt his existence entirely .
and you?
i believe .
then so must we .
whoa there , sister .
shouldn't we think talk about this?
you know , group like?
what do you say , mask melter?
i say we returned to metru nui to rescue the matoran , not go on safari .
and you have a way to do this?
perhaps using your new hordika powers ... powers you have not yet learned to use .
vakama .
i will talk with him .
what was that?
it meant you no harm .
i beg to differ .
it was just frightened .
muaka are loners by nature , and uncomfortable being close to others .
there's a bit of them in you .
careful with that .
it's a most powerful tool .
i'll be sure to learn how to make good use of it , wise one .
and what about your friends?
former friends .
they think being a leader is so easy , they can try it themselves .
true , but they won't succeed without you , nor you without them .
and how do you know that?
i don't .
but the great spirit does .
unity , duty , destiny .
it starts with unity .
if you toa are to rescue the matoran , you must do so together .
this is something you can't change .
watch me .
vakama?
oh , norik .
it is good you're back .
vakama has a lot on his mind .
we must give him time to find his destiny .
yeah .
what if he finds a really bad one?
uh , now then , we should begin our search for keetongu at once .
right .
keetongu .
getting turned back into our old handsome selves .
let's get on that .
but where to start?
somewhere you know well .
i can do it alone .
i'll show them all .
is that your best shot?
what's happening to me?
you are becoming ...
yeah , but what?
adriend .
or a foe .
that's for you to decide .
and why i've invited you here .
some invitation .
then perhaps this one will be more to your liking .
i've a proposal for you .
and ifl don'twantto hearit?
be reasonable , vakama .
how do you know my name?
i know a great deal about you .
what harm could come from listening?
the great temple?
i'm sure it could've helped our old toa selves , but now?
we'll never find a way to change back if you keep talking like that .
you're right .
i'm sorry .
i don't know what's gotten into me .
oh , that's right , some kind of monster !
oh , matau .
if you're quite done , we should go inside .
secrecy is such a burden , but sidorak mustn't knowwe speak .
sidorak?
ruler of the visorak .
and he doesn't know you captured me?
not yet .
huh !
some leader .
precisely .
you're not worried they're going to tell him you said that?
they are loyal to me .
right .
like you are to sidorak?
yes .
they obey me because i am strong .
they fear me , and therefore do not dare to question my authority .
that is leadership , vakama .
that is how the other toa should treat you .
maybe then they would give you the respect you deserve .
the visorak horde is countless , vakama .
they feel the weakness of their king's voice .
i trust my fellow toa to ...
to do what?
hold you back?
they're not worthy of a leader like you .
which is why i've brought you here .
ta ...
ta metru !
come along .
our best chance to find keetongu lies within the temple .
is something wrong?
it might be best if we wait here .
the great temple is sacred to toa .
given what has happened to us ,
i am not sure it would be right .
i understand .
our work here will not go unnoticed .
you must guard the gates .
we need until tomorrow morning .
consider it done .
hey , wait .
you know , i think we should talk about ...
no !
when i was matoran ,
ta metru was my whole world .
it meant everything to me .
it still does .
it can be your home again , vakama , to rule as you see fit .
all you need to do is lead those who will obey you properly .
lead the visorak horde .
i ...
i don't know .
i understand your reluctance .
you require proof .
throw yourselves off the edge .
obedience .
this is but the first of many lessons i can teach you .
and this is something your king would allow?
there is a way .
six ways .
i'm listening .
tears ... tears ...
follow the tears .
keetongu .
tears that reach the sky . " '
are you all right , gaaki?
norik .
i heard something .
probably just my approach .
age makes us loud as well as wise .
no , this was a creature .
visorak?
i'm ...
i'm sure it's nothing .
this is a very elaborate translation .
i guess i have been working hard lately .
gather our brothers and go outside .
i'll be right behind you .
who's there?
reveal yourself !
show yourself !
i doubt you'd recognise me .
i've got some bad news .
gaaki's not going to find her brothers upstairs .
what have you done with them?
nothing .
yet .
then it's not too late , vakama .
you don't have to do this .
give me one reason i shouldn't .
the other toa .
they need you to lead them .
always what's best for the others !
she was right about them , norik .
about me .
who have you been talking to , vakama?
who's put these thoughts in your head?
you'll find out soon enough .
i'm counting on it .
i don't understand .
you don't have to understand the message , norik , just carry it .
this message , what is it?
norik said they'd be done by daybreak .
did anyone see anything last night?
nothing .
lots of nothing .
yeah , boring .
i don't know .
i found the sounds of the night fascinating .
right .
i wonder what's taking the rahaga so long .
i mean , how hard is it to get directions?
well , when they're to a creature that has not been seen since the time before time ,
hard .
really?
oh , have patience , matau .
yeah .
take it easy , matau .
take it easy " !
i have absolutely no patience for looking like this .
we've already wasted a whole night .
the way i see it , the faster we get to the ...
the great temple .
come on !
hurry !
we have to find the rahaga .
come on !
bomonga !
norik !
gaaki !
norik !
oh !
total destruction .
where are you guys?
gaaki?
norik !
where are you?
lruini !
where are you guys?
norik , are you all right?
norik !
nuju , can you see anything?
what do you see?
i can't see anything .
huh?
there he is !
he's over there !
he's trapped .
stand back !
norik , what happened?
what should we do?
i wish vakama was here .
he ... was !
you must be confused , toa .
we do not welcome your kind here .
we exterminate it .
it's you that's confused , sidorak .
i am no simple toa .
hordika .
why have you come here?
to join you .
and to present you with proof of my worth .
vakama !
no !
let's talk .
vakama would never do such a thing .
right?
you are correct , nokama .
the vakama you know would not .
he's changed .
just as you all will if we do not find keetongu .
i fear vakama has given himself completely to the beast that lurks within us all .
the ancient , primal , the parts of ourselves we like to think progress has made us forget .
hordika is its name .
i don't think i want to be hordika .
it's not all bad , whenua .
not if you don't allow it to be .
being hordika grants you certain gifts .
assuming you're right , we must find keetongu and rescue the matoran before the beast overcomes us too .
yes , but i must warn you ,
vakama may already be beyond anything even keetongu can do .
well , we have to try .
we owe the fire spitter that much .
and iwas kind ofhard on him .
and if you can't help him?
leave that to me .
so , back to searching .
we were able to translate much of the inscription before vakama's attack .
follow the falling tears to ko metru until they reach the sky . " '
it is there we will find keetongu .
tears that reach the sky "?
it's not much of a plan , but it is one .
toa !
vakama !
that name means nothing to me .
it did once .
it can again .
that's true !
it can , if you want to be weak again .
never !
you are everything i had hoped you'd be .
come .
it's time you had a glimpse of your future .
quickly !
we must hurry .
as the toa hordika followed the trail of falling tears ,
norik was sure that it would lead them to the legendary keetongu .
as our brave heroes struggled through a most treacherous journey across the island of metru nui , the shadow of the visorak horde was never far behind .
as the noble group followed the stream of tears to ko metru , the deserts turned into great mountains of frozen protodermis , and its silvery surface led the brave travellers to a strange and wondrous place .
ah , thetears ...
they do reach the sky !
the throne will soon be yours , vakama .
go ahead .
touch it .
you can look , vakama , but don't touch .
i wanted to thank you personally .
because of you , the rahaga will be put where they belong in a cage .
it is just the beginning of what he can offer you .
is that so?
it is , my king .
vakama is my gift to you , a fitting master for your horde .
hordika or not , there's only one of him .
which is why the other toa are on their way here .
with vakama leading your horde , they will be captured and trained just like him .
will all six be enough to please you?
afineoffer , roodaka .
consider it an engagement gift .
well , then .
allow me to introduce you to the horde .
you know , vakama , we're really very much alike , you and l .
that was a compliment , vakama .
oh , thank you , my king .
oh , think nothing of it .
such is the generosity of my rule .
my horde is an obedient one .
they will do anything you command .
unless i command differently , of course .
of course .
good .
now , then .
behold the visorak horde .
perhaps you'd like to say a fewwords?
hurry , you guys !
it's amazing !
it's keetongu !
not .
don't be so quick to judge , matau .
we are sorry to disturb your rest , noble one , but the duty of these toa requires they ask for your help .
ok .
well , we'd like to stay and chat , but we gotta go .
whoa .
is everyone seeing this?
toa .
keetongu .
is it everything i promised you?
we'll soon find out .
yes .
anightofgreatconsequencefalls .
be ready .
before it is over , many things will change .
how is the horde , vakama?
obedient .
and ready . .. and then we were chased by the visorak , all of which is why we came here , and why we need your assistance .
will you help us get vakama back?
no .
well , thanks just the same .
we'll be going , then .
keetongu cannot start a battle on your behalf ... but he can aid those loyal to the three virtues .
in fact , doing so is his sworn duty .
so he'll change us back into our good looking , toa hero selves?
no .
aw .
keetongu sees with one eye what we have missed with all of ours .
if you are to save vakama , you must use your new forms and abilities , not be rid of them .
so we've come all this way just to find out we didn't have to come all this way !
ha , ha , ha , ha , ha .
he thinks it's funny , too .
ha ha ha .
right .
funny .
that's what i was thinking .
but your story and devotion to your friend has touched keetongu .
he finds your quest worthwhile .
and ...?
and he would like to offer us his help .
unity !
you too , big guy .
vakama !
nokama .
remember , vakama , you don't need them anymore .
you've made a grave mistake coming here !
we came here to save you .
the only ones you can save now are yourselves .
bow down and pledge your allegiance to me .
andtosidorak .
andwhenwedon't?
i will make you .
ready?
do you think this is gonna work?
aim .
ask me again in a minute .
nokama?
now !
let's go !
fire !
hey , wait for me !
let's go !
whoo hoo !
catch you guys later !
where's matau going?
there's too many of them .
let's just do it .
quick , jump !
still that sound .
what is that?
i guess it's keetongu .
but keetongu doesn't exist .
obviously , you're wrong about that .
i'll take care of him .
no , vakama .
it is not your place .
it is that of a king .
if keetongu wasn't a myth before , he soon will be .
stay here .
and be ready .
look out !
put me down !
you want down?
you got it .
your place is with us .
we're here to rescue the matoran .
the matoran?
you remember , don't you?
vakama !
yes !
i'm almost impressed .
well , that's that .
no ...
i mean , shouldn't we be certain?
if doing so would make you feel better .
it would .
what has happened to you?
you know , outside the obvious?
nokama !
here !
whoa !
the final blow is yours , roodaka .
where are you going?
finish him .
you do it .
but i can't defeat him myself .
i know .
roodaka?
no !
no !
no !
soon , makuta .
norik !
oh , no !
i'm caught !
this is it .
without vakama , we are destined to fail .
mind if we lend a hand?
whoo hoo !
thanks , norik .
i owe you one .
you are weak , brother .
you're right , vakama .
i am weak .
so , at the end you see the truth .
we all make mistakes , vakama .
that's what happens when you're brave enough to make decisions .
i understand that now .
i don't believe that coming from you .
wait !
not for long .
i'm sorry for doubting you .
our strength comes from our unity , vakama , which means you can't be strong without us .
i'm better and stronger alone .
i don't believe that , and i don't think you do , either .
you're our leader , vakama .
you're my leader .
we've got a job to do , a duty .
the matoran .
rescuing them is our destiny .
it's your destiny .
and if there's any of the vakama i know left , he'll know what to do next .
matau , don't !
matau !
i'm coming !
matau !
vakama !
hang on .
i've got a plan .
come and get it !
no !
we are surrounded .
there's too many of them .
what do we do now?
oh , i don't like this .
you have something i want .
your elemental powers .
earth .
stone .
ice .
water .
fire already belongs to me .
wait .
one's missing .
that would be air .
and he's all yours , my queen .
thank you , vakama .
now , about those powers ...
you want them so bad?
take them .
all right, whofiredtheticklespinner?
fools !
you , like your powers , are nothing if you are not united , and as vakama stands with me ...
actually , i wanted to talk to you about that .
you might defeat me , vakama , but not all of them .
strike me down and they will surely destroy you and your friends .
think about it .
i have .
and seeing as you convinced sidorak to put me in charge of them ...
get out of here , all of you !
you're free .
that's an order .
traitors !
you can't betray someone you're enslaved to .
and to think i thought you could be king .
i lead only those that choose to follow .
that's the difference between being a leader and a tyrant like you .
acertain toa taughtmethat .
no , vakama , don't !
vakama .
you have no idea what you've just done .
her heartstone ...
it's makuta's .
yes , carved from the same protodermis you sealed the makuta with .
in destroying it , you've broken that seal .
i know , and set makuta free .
for some reason , he doesn't scare me anymore .
keetongu .
help him up .
in light of all you've given , you owe us nothing , but my duty requires i ask , will you change us back?
he wants to know why you would want that , being as you've made peace with the beast within , that you might even be the better for it .
it's our destiny to be toa , and to keep our promise to the matoran .
duty ...
then so will you be .
now then , let's get all of you to safety .
put your back into it , brothers .
whoo hoo !
nice ship .
hey , matau , let's not crash it this time .
hey .
well , my friend ,
i guess this is it .
thank you .
you are most welcome , vakama .
but it's me that should be thanking you .
i don't understand .
it's not every day i get to see a legend come true , you know .
oh , yes , norik .
he is quite a sight .
indeed , but i wasn't talking about keetongu .
the great rescue .
yes .
and now we know that the matoran are in most capable hands .
your hands .
next stop , mata nui .
the makuta !
he is gone .
not for long .
i imagine we'll be seeing him again very soon .
and when we do?
we'll find a way to defeat him , because that's what toa do .
i was right .
makuta would follow us here , and threaten to cast our new world and all who came to call it home into everlasting shadow .
it was in those days
i discovered our destinies are not written in stone .
we have to find them for ourselves .
i found mine .
now it's time for you to make new legends , for that is the way of the bionicle .
