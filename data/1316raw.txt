i mean , look how far away you are from everything you wanted to be .
you live with mom and dad just to cover child support .

they're dead animal skulls .
hey .
will you open a checking account for me?
what? / a checking account .
oh man , i have been banned from banks for like the next 7 years , and there is a guy down state willing to sell me a human skull , but he says all i have to do is send him a check .
well , how would it work?
you open an account with my money and then write the check for me .
why would i want to do that?
i'd let you write some for yourself .
make up for all those birthdays and graduations i missed .
there's four grand in there .
thanks man .
hey , make sure when they give you those checkbooks you don't get the kind with kittens or seashells on them .
okay .
i just hate those things .
really pisses me off .
they are tacky .
i said okay .
why do you pee like that , jimmy?
get out of here .
is something wrong with your urinary tract?
what?
no .
just get out of here .
oh , jimmy , i was wondering if you might watch the girls while i do some grocery shopping .
i'm sorry , i sort of have something to do .
well , okay .
that's okay .
you always left tim and me alone .
can i borrow the van?
of course , honey .
you can just drop me off at the store .
oh , well , i'm not really going that way ...
never mind .
i could take you to the end of the way .
oh , no .
i'lljust walk .
it'll be good for me .
thanks , mom .
you need any money?
oh .
no .
actually , i'm good .
hey there .

mom takes me on all her first dates .
your mother and i already had a first date .
when?
last week .
the night she was out until three in the morning?
ready?
why is there a bed set up back here?
do you live in this van?
benjamin .
no , i don't live in this van .
wine coolers?
really?
what?
mom's a whiskey woman .
so , where are we going?
where would you like to go?
there's ice skating at the glenbrook mall .
no .
i know somewhere better .
girls , i'd like you to meet a friend of mine .
this is ben .
i thought maybe you might want to show him the trampoline out back .
you have a trampoline?
no , but our neighbors do .
take him girls .
it's freezing outside .
wear your coats .
you live with your parents?
just temporarily .
i'm leaving soon as my brother recovers .
yeah .
i sort of came back to have a nervous breakdown but the bastard beat me to it .
what's wrong with you?
chronic despair .
hey , what are you kids doing?
jumping .
well , who told you , you could jump on our trampoline?
jim .
he's my uncle .
well , tell your uncle jim that he needs to ask me before ...
he's not my uncle .
i hardly know him .
he's on a date with my mother right now .
he took mom up to his room ...
okay , okay .
that's fine .
just ask next time .
where's benjamin's dad?
he's around .
he sees ben every once a month or so , if he remembers .
and he doesn't have a problem with you dating?
oh , no .
he's incredibly jealous .
who are all these people?
they're all writers .
oh yeah?
that's virginia woolf .
underneath her is richard yates , he's one of my favorites .
what'd he write?
sad stories about sad people with pathetic dreams .
when he died almost all of his books were out of a print .
that's weird .
then of course there's poe and plath and buroughs .
thats a writer named breece d pancake .
next to him is beckett .
then dorothy parker .
the big one is hemingway .
oh yeah , i read him in high school .
he's good .
what did you like about him?
i think he had a boner for what he did , you know?
yeah .
his stories weren't as stuffy and made up as others .
they were realer .
he was a realist .
maybe that's why .
he shot himself in the head .
geez .
so did pancake .
that one threw himself off a bridge .
she put her head in an oven .
and that one , that one and that one all drank themselves to death .
is benjamin's dad going to try and hurt me?
you?
no .
i thought you said he was insanely jealous?
he wouldn't be jealous of you .
why not?
he just wouldn't .
besides , we're not dating .
we're not?
hey could you guys ... could you uh ...
do you have any board games?
oh god .
i brought you some snacks .
thanks .
did you bring any of those funions?
no is that what you wanted , honey?
but i do have some pork rinds .
how you feeling , tim?
shitty .
you're lucky to be alive , boy .
i called the girls 'mother .
they should be here soon .
how are they?
oh , they're good .
i told them to make sure and pray for you every night before they went to bed .
you had to tell them?
honey , you know what i mean .
jesus christ , tim .
donald , he just woke up from a coma .
and why was he in a coma in the first place?
he had an accident .
is that what happened?
did he have an accident?
yeah , i lived .
don't say that .
don't you dare ever say that .
you're mom's baby .
you're my big baby .
oh , god .
i'm going to get a drink of water .
you want anything?
nah .
oh .
hey .
i was just looking for you .
really?
yeah .
because you smell like you were just smoking .
where's mom and dad?
i asked them to leave .
oh , well how am i supposed to get home?
i don't know .
we didn't talk about it .
i got to get back to work .
it was nice meeting you , tim .
please don't hesitate to ring me if you need something .
you either , liar .
see you .
she's hot .
you think?
yeah .
you have sex with her?
um , yeah .
that's awesome .
thanks .
i meant for me .
it means she has no standards .
bet she'd do it with me too .
daddy !
girls .
where's your mother?
she's waiting downstairs .
everything okay , jim?
yeah , i was just writing .
you see your brother tonight?
he's looking better , don't you think?
yeah .
i love talking to you , jimmy .
how was work for you?
good .
i know you'd rather not be there ...
it's okay .
your brother always refused to work for us ...
really?
jim .
what did we do to make you kids so unhappy?
i don't know .
but what do you think?
be honest .
your such a smart , sensitive boy , jimmy .
i know you must have some opinion .
i don't know , mom .
maybe some people just shouldn't be parents .
i mean , it's just a thought .
look ...
no , i'm alright .
just tired .
good night , pretty boy .
good night .
look cold , want a ride?
on that?
i bought it with one of your checks .
whaddya think?
it's great .
you drive .
i'm tripping my head off right now .
what the fuck was that about?
dunno .
sally has been arrested for using the company's fed ex account to ship drugs
they have proof of her signature on over a dozen packages sent from here
are you kidding?
no i am not kidding does it sound like i am kidding?
maybe?
well , i'm not .
now listen , i'm going down there to explain to these peckerheads that they got the wrong person .
what i need you to do is cover for your mom and me while i'm gone .
sure , sure .
no problem , donny .
if anyone asks what's going on , just play dumb .
so , who do you think did this?
you .
me?
i can't believe you'd think that your own ...
cut the bullshit , evil .
i know it was you .
all right , you got me .
how could you be such an idiot?
i wrapped everyone of those packages in foil , and then i double plastic bagged them , and then i'd put a little big league chew in there too , grape ...
they are taking my mom to prlson , evil .
i understand that .
but you're not going to rat out your uncle stace now , are you?
you think i'd let my mother stay locked up for you?
i'd be a little nervous to narc out a guy with no money after you'd just opened a four thousand dollar account .
you fucker .
just be careful when you point a finger at someone else you are pointing three at yourself and a thumb to the sky .
what's that mean?
that means , is your piss clean?
what are you doing here?
mom brought me .
what is your mom doing here?
i didn't know that .
there's a lot people don't know about our central intelligence agency .
sounds so exciting .
it exciting and it's the type of work you can't help taking home with you , either .
oh .
hey .
aren't you home a little early?
something happened at work .
what's wrong?
i'm sorry , what exactly are you doing here?
i thought i'd help your brother get situated .
did the hospital send you?
no .
hey , i'm doing you a favor .
oh , yeah , i can see what a favor you're doing .
hey , you like basketball?
no .
ever played before?
no .
want to?
okay .
everybody , this is ben .
ben this is rachel , sarah and ... the rest of the team .
now , why don't you all grab a ball and start practicing?
it's one of my favorites .
well , thanks so much , sweetie .
mom is so happy you came down to visit .
so , what is this book about?
an impotent man's futile love .
oh ... great .
thanks so much , sweetheart .
so , how is it in here?
oh , it's not so bad .
the women are all very talkative .
i'm sorry about this , mom .
oh honey , it's not your fault .
the police put a freeze on our business , they figured that it was a drug front .
i can't even get into my own company they got padlocks on the doors .
your kidding .
there's nothing i can do .
a girl's here to see you .
said she's a nurse .
brought a little kid with her .
he's sitting right next to you , dad .
his name's ben .
oh .
hi , ben .
hello .
you want to get me another one of these from the fridge , buddy .
okay .
hi .
don't you work anymore?
it's my day off .
my father and brother are both in the house and ben is just downstairs .
i didn't come for that .
well why?
i don't know jim , i like to help people .
come in .
oh .
you .
evil .
this is stacy .
stacy .
yeah?
evil , i have to talk to you .
you wanna get in on this i still got a half hour?
the police have seized my parents 'business , evil .
damn , man .
that's too much .
that's ...
what are you going to do?
what are you going to do?
common there's not a jury in the world that's going to believe that that woman is selling drugs .
they will believe a guy like me does .
you do , evil .
see .
there's only one thing to do here , evil .
and you know what it is .
what?
confess and go to jail and man rape for the next five years?
you make your own choices .
look there's three thousand dollars left in that account .
that'll get you pretty far from here
no , i'm not going to sell my family out .
look , i'm family too .
i can't believe you .
hold on shithead .
that money is in your name and if you don't give it back to me then it's like you already accepted it .
make your own choices .
jim hey .
what?
it's full .
what's full?
jesus christ , man .
what don't you get your nurse do this?
i couldn't ask her to do that .
that's disgusting .
well , what do you want me to do with it?
clean it .
fuck that .
i need something to pee in .
okay .
uhhh .
just do what you want today .
i don't know what to tell you .
what kind of coach are you?
oh .
hey .
your team's not even playing basketball .
whatever .
you must not think much of your nieces then .
or ben .
or any of those kids out there .
you must not think much of me , either , i guess .
oh , i do .
i think you're all great .
what?
you think i'm great?
well , sure .
i think you're great .
there are so many fun and cheery people in the world .
don't you think you'd be better off with one of them?
someone more like yourself?
you think i'm fun and cheery?
of course you are .
you just can't stop complimenting me , can you?
you're missing my point .
no , i'm not .
i'm getting it very clearly .
you want to come in?
it's okay .
i don't mind .
no .
i think i'lljust say good bye here .
okay .
bye , ben .
bye .
bye , anika .
good night , jim .
you can kiss if you want .
i don't care .
you're kind of apathetic for such a little guy , aren't you , ben?
yeah .
good night , you two .
mom , you're home .
yup .
how?
something called bail .
one of the girls in prison told me about it .
apparently your father never realized it was an option .
i called a very nice bondsman in kendalville who put up the money for me .
that's great .
oh , honey don't touch that .
it's for kiki .
who's kiki?
she's the con that gave me the number for the bondsman .
i'm going to bring cobbler to her and all of girls
i made friends with at county .
all those ladies were so nice to me .
it's hard to believe they're criminals .
have you talked to tim?
oh .
yeah .
same old tim .
i need a fork .
my fork !
jimmy .
jim .
yoo hoo .
jimmy .
wake up .
you have visitors .
who?
get your ass up , jim .
it's four o 'clock .
sorry to say ass in front of you , mrs. roush .
oh , no .
it worked .
hi , jimmy .
hi , mom .
you have a nice nap?
yeah .
your little friend , ben , is helping me make dinner downstairs .
oh .
ben's here?
we're making goulash .
jim's my pretty boy .
i brought you something .
what?
don't get too excited , it's not much .
what is it?
a smile , for poor old hemingway .
i don't know .
it doesn't look right to me .
that's because you're used to seeing it the other way .
the other way is true to life .
the other way is depressing .
like i said ...
oh , jim .
you smell nice .
thanks .
i like you a lot , anika .
i like you a lot , too .
so does ben .
he does?
oh my god , he totally looks up to you .
oh no .
it's true .
ben shouldn't look up to me .
sure he should .
no he shouldn't .
why?
i think i might of caused my brother to hurt himself .
that's crazy .
i told him life was pointless and i couldn't believe he hadn't killed himself .
so , anika , i understand you're a nurse .
yes , i am mrs. roush .
that's great .
i love the work .
so , where'd you two meet?
at a bar .
tim just can't stop saying enough nice things about you .
oh , how is tim?
i haven't talked to him today .
oh he's good .
benjamin?
yes .
do you go to school yet?
he's in third grade .
third grade?
but you're so little .
you're little .
benjamin .
anika?
as you know tim broke both of his legs so he can't easily get in and out of bed we got him one of those crooked plastic bottles for you know his business , but its not quite big enough for his ...
mom ...
to tell you the truth i don't really like my family that much .
what a terrible thing to say .
its true i mean i love them all to death , but i just can't stand to be so close .
well what good is that kind of love?
i'm thinking of leaving .
you know , i was thinking , maybe you and ben could come with me .
where?
i don't know .
great .
sounds like a good plan .
where would you like to go?
i can't afford to go anywhere .
sure you can .
there are nursing jobs all over the country .
just pick a place .
well , you know , i've always wanted to go to new orleans .
new orleans .
why new orleans?
bourbon st.
what's your second choice?
vegas .
i've heard really good things about new orleans .
let's try it there first .
i can't just up and move to new orleans .
you can if you do .
what about ben's dad?
he's a deadbeat .
i should be ben's dad .
you're crazy .
am i?
what's this?
it's an inspector nestor book .
remember when you used to read these to me?
you'd always know how each story was going to end half way through every book .
they were predictable .
maybe .
i could never guess them .
you're an idiot .
anyway , i found them in the garage .
thought maybe you could read em to the girls .
they miss you , you know?
the whole team misses you .
sure .
they do .
i bet they haven't even noticed .
they're playing their last game this weekend .
anything you want me to tell the team at last practice?
tell them to make a fucking basket .
i can't do it .
maybe you can .
maybe you can't .
but you'll never know unless you try .
i've been trying all practice .
true .
hey , you two .
hey .
what gives?
i thought practice was supposed to be over 30 minutes ago
jim won't let me go until i make five more baskets .
i'm sorry benjamin .
i didn't mean to make you feel like you couldn't go home if you didn't make the shots .
but that's what you said .
why didn't you call if you knew you were going to be late?
i'm sorry , i didn't know it was that big a deal .
yeah , well it is a big deal .
stuff like that is a very big deal to moms .
what's your problem , anika?
nothing , jim .
just , you can't ask a girl to move 1082 miles away with you unless you're really going to follow through .
why wouldn't i follow through?
because you don't know what it would be like .
what would it be like?
difficult .
very difficult .
great .
i'm used to challenges .
you're use to avoiding them .
well , maybe i don't want you to .
oh .
okay .
i just said maybe .
no , the whole idea was stupid anyway .
come on ben .
come on anika .
i'd like to make a withdraw please .
i need to be on my own .
i understand .
sometimes mom wishes she could be on her own too .
what?
nothing .
just kidding .
where you going to?
maybe new orleans .
oh fun .
you know mom's never really been anywhere .
i know mom .
maybe i'll come visit you after my trial .
or before , either would be great .
i can't really leave the state until after
jimmy .
all right team , i know it's been a rough season
girls ... but ...
sorry , i'm late .
no problem , benjamin .
is your mom here?
no .
like i said , i know it's been a rough season for us this year .
not a lot of shots have fallen for us .
in fact not a single shot has fallen for us in 14 games .
so i guess the question we need to ask ourselves is , are we going to let those 14 games determine the next one?
because if we are , then we may as welljust go out there and shake hands with the other team .
congratulate them on their victory .
i see some of you nodding your heads in agreement right now .
by all means , it's not an altogether absurd idea .
odds are , we are going to lose no matter how we go about playing this game .
so why do we play at all?
well team ...
i don't really have an answer for that .
and do you know why?
because its a stupid question asked by a doubtful and unhappy man .
forget his question .
you just got to keep playing .
because if you don't you might end up like him and let me tell you , he is no fun .
nobody knows what we're capable of .
the past does not always predict the future .
now that team may have seen us play before but they've never seen us play today .
am i right? / yeah .
am i right?
yeah .
well , all right then .
well let's show them what we can do .
one , two , three .
go ladders .
hey , come on .
come over here .
no long faces .
that was good .
that was our best game yet .
shut up , jim .
good job , jimmy .
you make a great coach .
dear mom i don't know where to start , so i'lljust begin with the end and work my way back .
i came home because i ran out of money and had nowhere else to go .
if i'd had any other option , i would have taken it .
i did not consider the simple fact of having a place to return a blessing
instead , i thought of it as a burden and a symbol of failure .
i'm ashamed to admit that growing up i pitied you and what i thought was your naive belief that our dreams could come true , simply by virtue of having them .
because the truth , as i witnessed it , was something completely different .
the truth actually was that nothing worked out and no one , anywhere lived the life they wanted .
but i see now , that it was me with the naive belief .
i thought if i resigned myself to disappointment , at least i'd be better off then those people who tried and failed .
and i hate myself for only realizing this now and for taking and taking from you without giving anything back .
you are one of the few good peaches in are one of the few good peaches in
i promise not to waste anymore time or take your love for granted again .
i love you so much .
jim .
p. s. the money in this envelope is from stacy .
i figure he owes you at least this much for all the snacks he's stolen .
and he's the one who's been sending drugs through the fed ex account .
promise to call you soon .
jim
thirsty?
what are you doing here?
benjamin wanted to apologize to you for telling you to shut up .
i'm sorry jim .
that's alright , benjamin .
how'd you find me?
we stopped by the house to see you .
your dad told us .
where you going?
new orleans . / great .
benjamin , do you want to say goodbye to jim?
bye , jim .
bye ...
benji .
you be good to your mother .
and promise me not to get too much more apathetic .
at least not until your teens .
okay .
it never would have worked out anyway .
is that your bus?
yeah .
you better run .
bye .
bye , jim .
stop that , benji .
common lets go .
mom .
stop the car .
can i get a ride?
sure .
i thought you never ran .
