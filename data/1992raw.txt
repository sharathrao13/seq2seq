a military dictatorship was in power .
all the military could think about was power .
poweroverthe students , poweroverthe workers ... poweroverthe press .
those were tough days .
it was the year brazil became third time soccerchampion ... in mexico world cup .
third time champion is a sort of fifth time champion of those days .
this film is about all that stuff .

this dictatorship mini blouse was " expopriated " and will be used ... in the struggle for the proletarian worker's revolution !

comrades , our meeting in the steak house will make history .
i feel that destiny has united us ... so that together we shall overthrow the dictatorship , comrades !
this is the only way we'll be able to build a more just society .
and with much more justice .
hey , man ...
i don't give a damn whether society is gonna be more just or not .
i just want one thing , to finish off the king of brazilian music !
gee , man , what have you got against ...
don't say his name , man .
i can't stand that guy's name !
i still remember as if it were yesterday ... the day i boarded that bus ... in cachoeira do itapemirim .
peixoto carlos , nice to meet you .
nice to meet you , roberto .
so , man , you going to rio de janeiro?
yeah , i'm gonna try ... ... my luck in the big city .
have you got a job there?
no , but anything which comes my way is fine by me .
how about you?
ah , i'm gonna be a great famous singer .
by the way , when i'm up there in the hit parade ... give me a call , and i'll help you out , ok?

they can do whatever they want .
if they wanna go around wearing beards , lipstick or a negligee ... it's their problem !
they do the ordering , i obey .

hey , driver , don't make a weapon out of your vehicle .
the victim might be me .
you know nothing about driving , do you?
easy , comrade pel .
easy , comrades of the national squad .
we'll take you home soon .
there's been a small problem .
everyone'll have to get down and push the truck .
pel , you're lucky .
you needn't get down , you're already down !
this is ours .
comrade , i'll keep the cup here in the truck .

the firemen left the world champions here , on foot? !
there must be a fire at the house of someone very important , right?
the dlctatorshlp's long nlght
come on , you wimp , we're always the last to arrive .
hey , dolores , what's the rush?
i don't know what you see in these high command meetings .
just boring old men droning on ... and these half naked women doing the boogie .
one moment , one moment !
excuse me , but apart from the half naked women ... females of the feminine sex are not allowed .
what? !
what? !
have you lost all sense of danger , young man?
do you know who you're talking to?
we didn't have the revolution ... just to be barred by some shitty soldier !
easy , dodozinha , he's right .
we'd better go .
let's go?
you shut up , i'm arguing with this young man here !
get out of the way !
get out of the way !
or perhaps you'd like to try ... ... the stick?
no , no !
general manso , the phone's ringing .
the red phone?
my direct line to the president !
but , general , the phone's blue .
idiot !
red is a commie color !
you think i'd have commie colored phone? !
hello , mr. president .
certainly , mr. president .
don't worry .
as soon as the parade finishes , the players will bring me the cup .
tomorrow morning , the cup will be at the palace , mr. president .
would you like a drink?
cuba libre?
cuba libre?
no , i wouldn't , it's out of the question , i won't have it .
the presence of a communist drink in this place ... is a provocation to the brazilian armed forces !
i'll have you put on the stick !
no , no !
private stick !
not again !
he's all yours !
yes , sir !
s ... tick !
gal . " costa tonlght hey , dolores ... there's a gal costa concert on tonight?
but isn't she that hairy hippie friend of those commie musicians?
no , you idiot , it's a concert by general costa ... the biggest name in brazilian military music .
hello , all you guys in the barracks !
hello , crazy people in high command !
i want everyone shaking their bones .
uh , uh , uh so tough
uh , uh , uh so tough
so tough being a hard line soldier
spending your life arresting commies
to beat and punch without censor
and then make them disappear without a trace
uh , uh , uh so tough
uh , uh , uh so tough
so tough the dictatorship's long night
paint trees and torture wash toilets
shine boots with courage
in defense of brazilian territory
your attention !
i bring an ultra secret and confidential message ... authorized only for 5 star generals or higher .
all others must immediately begin ... the security procedure for secret messages .
standard procedure begun .
this message will self destruct in 15 seconds .
the jules rimet cup has been stolen ... by a group of dangerous terrorist subversives .
how long's it been?
thirteen , fourteen ...
as the commander of the important mission ... to recover the jules rimet cup , i'd like to say ...
you'll say nothing , manso !
the only ones scared of you are your little generals here !
you're not taking charge of this operation .
my husband will command this operation , general miranda imbiruu ... ... of the brazilian army !
me? !
are you crazy , dolores?
chasing commies is very stressful .
don't be dumb , mirandinha .
this is our chance .
you find the cup , get famous ... become the next president , and i'll be first lady .
but , mrs. dolores ...
there'll be no discussion !
absolutely not !
i've made my decision and decided .
enough beating around the bush .
let's go , mirandinha !
what a fantastic woman .
what a female !
the world cup is ours , comrades !
it's our first victory against the dictatorship .
long live the vrm !
vrm?
what the hell's vrm?
vladimir's revolutionary movement .
why vladimir?
because the movement's mine !
that's not fair .
as a member of the artistic class , i should have been consulted .
that name , vrm , it's no good , man .
and anyway , why " v "?
i thought wladimir was with " w " .
you don't understand anything about dictatorship , comrade .
do you really think i'd use my real name?
wladimir with " v " is my code name to fool the repressive forces ... of the repression .
holy cow , what a lot of smoke !
it looks like my bedroom !
the vehicle used in the operation is no longer operational .
we shall have to continue the revolutionary struggle ... on foot !
comrade peixoto carlos , give me the cup we took from the dictatorship .
groovy , man .
now that we have the cup ... the military will have to meet our demands .
sure thing , man !
we must also demand an end to racism ... in brazilian music .
the only reason i never became famous ... was because the movement wouldn't allow a black singer !
hold on , you're not black .
yeah , that was another drawback .
hey , you six .
i recognize you .
you're artists , aren't you?
wait a minute .
you're blind drunk .
you must be mistaking us for someone else .
no , i'm not , it's you .
there's a picture of you on that poster .
only artists appear on posters !
look !
want ...
hold on , comrade alcoholic , i'll read that .
wanted dangerous subversive terrorists .
dead or alive .
preferably ... dead .
dead? !
we're done for !
they won't just kill .
they'll arrest , then beat us and torture us ... with red hot iron bars , damn it !
gee , tear down that poster before someone sees it !
you tearing down poster?
then i hope you're not in a hurry .
look .
wanted oh , my god !
look !
look !
lh , look !
it's us , it's us !
my dear god .
now what?
what are we to do?
young man , why don't you get a ride ... with that lady who's been following you all this time?
what a coincidence meeting you here .
oh , you're that chick with no panties ... from the steak house , waving all that meat about?
you and your car are hereby " expopriated " ... to be used in the fight against the dictatorship !
from now on , you and your car belong to the vrm ...
vladimir's revolutionary movement .
gee , there you go again with that awful name , man .
yeah , that name's terrible .
we should think up a more fashion name .
i know it's none of my business .
i know it's your revolutionary group ... but couldn't you discuss this some other time ... and hurry up and decide where we're going?
yeah , where are we going , wladimir?
i couldn't care less .
when it comes to naming the movement , my name stinks .
where are we going , wladimir?
go to hell !
sorry to interrupt again .
i know it's not my terrorist group ... but i also know a great place for us to hide .
all right , we really do need a nice safe , cozy hiding place ... to rest up till we take up the fight again ... and finally overthrow capitalism !
let's go !
i must be sitting on something , man .
what a weird bag .
hey , don't insult my bag .
it's made of real straw .
it's from jamaica !
wait .
if it's from jamaica , it must be good stuff .
guys , this revolutionary life of yours is so exciting .
this fight for freedom , this defiance .
shut up !
you're nothing but a daughter of the middle class bourgeoisie ... which is handing brazil over to the american yankee imperialism ... ... from abroad !
ah !
oh !
you gave me goosebumps !
wow , baby , you say such beautiful things .
ah , but i bet you say it to all the girls .
withdraw your bourgeois fingers from my revolutionary member !
nothing must distract me from the fight for ultimate victory !
and we die and we die
on highway br 3 on highway br 3
a rocket tears through the sky
crossing space and jesus christ
damn them , they stole my song !
i wrote that , man !
only it was a different highway and the words more instructive .
listen .
we run
we run
on highway br 101
which borders the brazilian coast
crossing the atlantic mountain range
there's a dream colorful trip
sometimes start
trouble !
the men !
holy cow !
we've had it !
i've got to get rid of this !
come on , come on !
my god .
or rather , not my god because i'm an atheist .
we're in the repression clutches !
out !
get out !
easy , baby , leave it to me , i'll sort this out .
hand me my bag .
get my papers .
they must be there back .
your papers were in the bag?
i'll only be able to give them back tomorrow .
do you have an emergency triangle?
yes , sir .
then show it to me .
it must be here somewhere .
this car sure has a big trunk .
you can fit quite a lot in it .
all right , girl , that's fine .
i've seen the triangle .
you can go .
thanks !
nice place .
we'll " expopriate " this bourgeois property ... ... for the revolution !
great .
i don't know ...
i'm not sure my father will like this expropriation .
he loves his roses .
you know how generals are .
they have funny ways .
you're a general's daughter?
yes , she was at the steak house with the general with no panties .
the general had no panties?
wait .
how come you brought us right into the enemy's lair?
easy , baby !
my folks haven't been here for ages .
there's no way they're gonna show up just now .
mirandinha , you're a moron !
we shouldn't go to the farm at a time like this !
you should have stayed to investigate the cup's theft !
dodozinha , but it's been so long since i saw my rose bushes ... my chickens .
i miss them so .
it wasn't for watering roses or breeding chickens .
that the revolution occurred .
miranda imbiruu , you're no general ... you're the disgrace of the brazilian army !
oh , dolores , i joined the army for a quiet life ... to whitewash trees , for the annual parade .
now they've invented this dictatorship thing ... hunting down communists .
communists are too wild , they're all young kids !
comrades , we've no time to lose !
the world cup is ours !
the dictatorship is in our hands !
long live the vrm !
vladimir's revolutionary movement !
no , cut it out , man .
we already told you a thousand times we don't like that name .
gee , i don't know why you keep insisting .
forget it , ok?
yeah , man !
let's choose a name for our band , i mean ... terrorist gang here , now and by mutual agreement , all right?
sure thing .
all right , then .
so let's have a meeting .
you're promoted from revolution driver ... to revolution secretary !
go get a pen and paper !
right away , comrade .
right , so since the militants won't name the organization ... after its great leader , which genius has a better idea?
i was thinking of something like ...
department of ...
international ...
communist ...
komrades .
groovy !
d. i. c. k. i love this name !
no , wait !
no one will want anything to do with dick !
i wouldn't mind .
you and your dirty mind !
this revolution is serious , comrade !

carlos revolutionary ...
anti carnivorous party !
everyone in agreement?
yeah , the carlos is great .
c. r. a. p. crap .
wow , that's great .
it suits you perfectly !
look .
what's lucy ellen's car doing here?
i can smell something fishy .
honey , that was me .
sorry .
you know me and my gases .
the bumpy road on the way up .
sorry about that .
oh , my god !
my mum and dad !
trouble !
my god !
let's go , let's go !
hurry up with that key , mirandinha !
i must find out what my daughter is up to in there !
the cup !
leave it to me !
wait , honey , i can't get it in .
look , mirandinha , you've always been useless ... but now's your moment .
come on , you moron !
lucy ellen !
mother !
what a lovely surprise !
i was just talking about you to the holy fathers .
fathers? !
lucy ellen , you're with priests?
you don't even go to church !
yes , but , mother , it's never too late to find god's word .
i came here to meditate .
and these reverends ... were just passing through this region spreading jesus 'message !
what a marvelous coincidence , isn't it , my daughter?
an amazing coincidence .
almost a miracle .
so , mother , if it's a miracle , that's got to do with religion !
mother , wasn't it you who always wanted me ... to follow the path of faith?
sure , dodozinha , stop giving the girl a hard time .
your blessing , father .
god bless you , man .
so you're priests , are you?
and if you're priests ... you can answer one little question !
where was our lord , the savior , born?
in cuba .
cuba? !
cuba? !
i knew something strange was going on in here !
wait , i know .
moscow .
moscow? !
brothers , let's go .
we must take god's word ... to other sheep in our flock , man .
sure thing .
amen , amen !
let's go !
mirandinha , the cup !
wait , it's mine !
mirandinha !
you're surrounded !
there's no pointing in trying to defend yourselves !
hand over the cup and commit suicide !
not necessarily in that order !
they've destroyed my rose bushes ... and killed my hens .
have they no limits? !
where will this revolution end?
stop blubbering , mirandinha !
stop being such a wimp .
you know you can't have a revolution without breaking a few eggs !
it's no use , general manso , it was my husband who found the cup ...
general miranda imbiruu , of the brazilian army !
mirandinha is a blockhead !
he can't even find his way home !
but it's my mirandinha who's going to get promoted .
he'll be the president !
mirandinha , president?
only of the impotent pensioners reserve club !
impotent , yes !
but impotent president of brazil !
retreat !
i have to admit ... that dolores is one helluva woman !
welcome .
that's why i like working with you communists , always punctual .
look , this place is exactly what you asked for .
hidden , total privacy .
it's been a hideout for several kidnappings .
it's one of the most sought after hideouts in rio de janeiro .
it's falling apart .
haven't you got a better hideout?
we've got places for all types of leftwing movements .
for example , the festive left .
look at that wonderful mansion ... with a pool , a huge ballroom .
if you're maoist , just look at this wonderful place .
right next to a chinese restaurant .
the thing is , we're rather short of cash .
commies are always complaining about money !
where's moscow's gold?
rob a bank , shit !
comrade , you don't understand .
we want something real cheap , almost free .
we haven't got anything for the poor , it's a hot market .
hundreds of clandestine organizations are splitting every day .
the demand's enormous !
this is the cheapest hideout i have !
man , who are those guys?
easy , that's the last tenant .
he's handing the place over today .
so , comrades , i'm returning this american ambassador .
i won't need the hideout anymore .
here's the key .
what about the contract?
oh !
i smoked the contract .
sorry .
that guy's an ass !
didn't even leave a stub of contract for me to smoke .
buddy , we'll take it .
now excuse us , we've got a lot to do here .
congratulations on the hideout .
happy revolution to you !
now when you take power , don't forget daddy here , will you?
don't go sending me to no firing squad !
nls , national information service , can i help you?
yes , sir , we give any information .
weather forecast?
nice weather .
subject to storm strikes .
bring us the subject , and we'll strike him .
gentlemen , i have information ... that the terrorists are right here .
our troops will move along this flank ... supported by tanks coming from the rear .
general , it would be better to attack with fighters and parachutes .
sure !
i'll come in next with my phantom f 5's ... equipped with 50 mm schmautze machine guns .
no , no fighters !
we must use my parachutists !
yes , i like the parachutists which go tcum topof .
we'll attack with the parachutists !
damn , isn't anyone interested in my fighter planes?
just look .
they have lights , bombs and make noise .
yeah , you're right .
let's attack with the fighters with lights !
my first hideout .
i'm so excited .
me too .
i'm getting goosebumps , you know .
oh , how cute .
you're all excited?
while you're getting goosebumps in here ...
i'm going in there because i've got something very important ... to sort out with wladimir .
oh , wladimir !
oh , baby !
oh , i wanna embrace your cause !
i must join this revolutionary life !
look , i'll do anything !
no , lucy , you must understand .
the life of a revolutionary is very hard .
oh , hard?
but that's just what i like .
calm down , lucy , think of our struggle .
fidel and che spent 5 years in sierra maestra with no sex .
fidel and che?
i never even knew they had an affair !
oh , my revolutionary !
frederico eugnio !
mother?
you here?
son , you left the door of the hideout open !
if the dictatorship come in here and find you without your shirt ... you'll catch a cold !
put on your cardigan , son .
mummy's darling little boy !
behave and tomorrow i'll bring you some cake , ok?
ok , mom .
you're gonna have to choose .
either stay with me ... or with mummy , her cardigan , her cake .
wait , lucy , that's going too far .
have you ever tasted my mum's cakes?
you really are a jerk !
i'm going off to screw the first person i come across !

we're not bluffing !
this is the earof the jules rimet cup !
if you don't collaborate , there'll be nothing left of it !
but how can i be sure this ear is the real one?
easy .

come alone .
sure , sure .
if you don't , we'll melt your daughter ... and make the cup pregnant !
hell , you understand , right?
marlo fllho stadlum
gee , what's that , man?
how crazy .
folks , didn't you say 5 o'clock?
it's a minute past 5 .
my dad's not coming .
you can all start getting me pregnant .
oh , my god !
lucy ellen , darling ... you really are with the communists !
are you at least wearing panties?
yes , daddy .
what a relief .
she's wearing panties .
no , dad .
i'm with the communists !
enough of this bourgeois small talk !
we have the jules rimet .
we shall only return this symbol of dictatorship ... if you comply with our demands !
you communists are so stressed out .
first i must be sure ... you really have the trophy .
how can i be sure ... this ear you sent was really from the jules rimet?
it can be from any trophy .
the guanabara cup ...
here's the proof .
look here the jules rimet trophy !
attention , communists !
you're surrounded !
you with the cup ... hand it over and commit suicide !
not necessarily in that order !
platoon , come back immediately !
that's a statue , you idiots !
the terrorists have gone the other way !
mirandinha , you muddler !
don't just stand there , you fool !
go and get reinforcements !
reinforcements?
i know !
i'll call dolores !
welcome to the indian museum .
me indian jonathan .
i'll be your guide .
look , man .
i mean , indian .
we haven't got any liquor , all right?
indian jonathan wants no firewater .
indian jonathan wants to be your guide .
no shorts , no photography ... and the bag must stay outside .
no , mr. indian , we haven't time to visit the museum now .
ouch !
look !
they can't be far .
i can smell communist .
they went ... that way .
thanks for the information , my good savage .
sergeant , give him some liquor .
when i get my hands on those bastards , i'll destroy them !
general , we've searched the whole museum .
we found no one , sir !
the museum is deserted , sir !
it's a disgrace , but in our country no one visits museums .
no one values our culture .
damn !
they got away again !
platoon , about turn , march !
oh , shit !
folks , let's get the cup and thank comrade indian savage .
where's the indian?
where's the cup?
oh , look , the cup !
wow , the indians won the world cup too , man .
what are you talking about , comrade?
can't you see?
the indians worship a god just like the jules rimet trophy .
the indian robbed us .
we'll never see the cup again .
damn .
wait a minute .
papa pussy village .
located on the left bank of the amazon river .
take the second stream after the lights .
comrades , we'll go after this indian .
dry axe !
avold persplring and attract women
destroylng ralnforest?
use tabajara chalnsaws
don't move , man !
comrade stewardess ... this plane is being " expopriated " in the name of the revolution !
comrade pilot , we're the crap revolutionaries .
we demand that this plane fly immediately to the amazon !
but this plane is already going to the amazon .
really?
yes .
fine then .
that's great .
then we demand two sodas for each crap member ... or we'll blow up the plane .
a very strange thing has just happened ... here near maracan stadium in rio de janeiro .
a statue was found dead ... with over 40 machine gun shots .
we're going to try to speak to general manso ... in charge of the operation , to find out what happened .
unfortunately , the statue committed suicide ... after a profound nervous crisis .
but , general , suicide with a machine gun?
what's the problem?
people can kill themselves as they wish !
this is a democracy !
sure , only i've never seen a suicide with 40 shots .
no?
that's the trouble with the press , so badly informed .
soldier , show this reporter how to commit suicide ... ... with 40 machine gun shots .
go !
stop !
wait !
attention !
in a daring operation , a dangerous subversive group ... has just abducted a plane bound forthe amazon .
the plane's route was diverted to the ...
amazon .
the terrorists have been identified as crapmembers ...
carlos revolutionary anti carnivorous party .
carlos?
why carlos?
oh , my st. salustiano !
it's my frederico eugnio !
he went to the amazon , with all that jungle and humidity !
and forgot his cardigan !
mirandinha , jump down , arrest those subversives ... get the cup , so that you'll be president ... ... and i'll be first lady .
but , dolores , are you sure?
me , alone in the middle of the amazon , it's very dangerous .
the forest is full of ferocious animals .
lions , tigers , rhinoceros .
those are not nationalist animals !
there are just piranhas , alligators and poisonous snakes !
green light !
jump !
go , stop balking !
so?
did you get rid of the cuckold?
sure , my hot general .
now we have all the time in the world just to make love .
make love? !
i'm bad , i'm real bad .
i'm as bad as they come .
a guy like me doesn't make love !
i do just dirty stuff !
manso , i bet you say that to all the girls .
we'll never find the indians in all this jungle !
gee , we should get rid of all this jungle .
what if we smoked the forest?
denlson , i've gotta tell you something , man .
you've gotta kick this addiction .
what addiction , smoking?
no , taking it in the ass .
gotcha !
my god !
i'm sorry !
did i hurt you?
no problem .
i probably only broke a couple of ribs or my collar bone .
but it's good .
at least it makes a change from the usual routine .
what a pretty cardigan .
can you teach me that stitch?
sure .
it's like this .
that's great .
where did you learn how to knit?
in the army .
they teach you loads of things , you know .
miranda imbiruu , at your service .
julieta , pleasure .
i'm knitting this cardigan for my son .
look at him .
isn't he cute?
but imagine , he's in the middle of this jungle , this forest ... this humidity , and he's always going out without his cardigan .
just like my daughter .
lucy ellen is always going out without her panties .
kids are all the same , so much trouble .
but listen to me , mr.
miranda , in the army ... apart from knitting , what else do you do?
i'm a general .
i'm in the field ... of repression and combat of subversive terrorists .
but i'm dying to retire .
gardening's more my thing ... ... planting my rose bushes .
oh , roses !
i love roses !
mr. miranda .
you can call me mirandinha .
oh , i think we've already been here before .
easy , comrade .
let's check the map .
here !
when i find those communists , i'll tear out every hair ... then pull their balls and twist them until they bleed !
manso , you're so romantic !
welcome to papa pussy vlllage
welcome to papa pussy village .
no photography , no shorts ... and you'll have to leave that outside .
name?
wladimir .
lucy ellen imbiruu .
peixoto carlos , ok?
listen here , mr. indian , why all this bureaucracy?
you're not a cop , what do you need records for?
indian jonathan isn't filling in records .
indian jonathan is writing menu .
you needn't grill me !
nothing will make me name my comrades !
are you crazy , peixoto?
we're your comrades ... everyone's here , man !
hands up .
hands up .
raise your hands ... put down your weapons and let the cute one go .
wow , what a beard .
what a hat .
hey , man , don't i know you from someplace?
cat stevens !
man , i've been wanting to meet you for ages !
hey , didn't you steal a song of mine , huh?
wait , comrade .
this isn't cat stevens .
this is the great commander che guevara !
but , commander , i thought you had died .
it was in all the papers .
no , i didn't die .
that was all planned .
a great marketing ploy to increase sales ... of my t shirts and posters with my face .
but , commander , what about the guerilla war?
that today is just a hobby ... something for the weekends .
the t shirt market is much more lucrative .
but one day we'll take up the guerrilla war again , ok?
commander , i'm your greatest fan .
i have a tattoo of you .
look !
yes , the beard's the same ... but fidel is the one who smokes cigars .
wait , commander , you're looking at the wrong place .
the tattoo is on the thigh .
oh , i see .
mirandinha , do you know where we're going?
listen , in the army , did you ever take ... a jungle survival course?
julieta , i've done 62 trainings for jungle survival .
wow , i had no idea you guys trained so much .
no , only i failed 62 times .
are we in vietnam?
well , honey .
i think i'll have to recalculate .
we went a little bit further .
we'll have to go back .
without me , the revolution would be nothing .
we were in sierra maestra ...
fidel , camilo cienfuegos " y yo " .
joe? !
what the hell was joe cocker doing in cuba , man?
don't be stupid , comrade .
yo " means " me " in spanish !
you were in sierra maestra too , man?
wow , commander , you say such amazing things .
but tell me something , baby ... are all guerrilla fighters as charming as you?
lucy , guerrilla fighters aren't charming .
they're ugly , dirty , bearded , stinking , sweaty .
stop , wladimir !
you're only saying that to make me horny , right?
i think we'd better go to sleep and leave the commander to rest .
good idea , good idea .
let's all get some sleep .
men on one side , women ... in different tents , ok?
to avoid any trouble which might damage the revolution , ok?
let's get some sleep .
didn't i tell you , lucy?
sex between fighting comrades ... only wastes the energy which should be used ... in the fight against the oppressive forces of the oppression .
holy cow !
this rifle's excellent .
must be from jamaica .
it's now that the cock will crow .
chick , chick .
see how fine .
wow !
oh , che !
how big !
you ain't seen nothing yet , we must grow hard !
but ... without ever losing one's tenderness , right?
chick , now i'll show you ... how we do it down in cuba .
oh , che !
not down there !
it hurts too much !
oh , che !
delicious .
i forbid this sexual copulation !
you are violating commander che guevara's ... ... revolutionary rules !
calm down !
calm down , comrade cuckold , you don't understand !
che !
it's you?
what's this , comrade?
you fooled me !
you betrayed the revolutionary ideals !
you communists are really boring , so stressed out !
you can't even have a quick screw in peace !
look , if it weren't for the t shirt business ...
i'd have got out of this a long time ago !
bastard !
easy , comrade cuckold !
easy , comrade cuckold !
easy , comrade cuckold !
bastard .
calm down !
oh , my god !
a shot !
do you think something's happened to my frederico eugnio?
if it's lucy , dolores will kill me !
frederico eugnio , what's happened?
are you all right , son?
don't worry , i brought your cardigan , look !
damn , i've killed che guevara !
what's going on?
this member of the dictatorship ... allied to the american yankee imperialism ... has just assassinated the great leader che guevara !
me?
julieta , your son's crazy !
i only just got here !
che is dead .
and now , what shall we do?
i don't know about you .
i'm going to the beach .
i'm going to bzios to grab a few hot bitches .
you've no revolutionary conscience !
i shall fight on !
now , with the commander's second death ... the t shirt business will expand wildly !
true .
i'm off to the beach .
money comes first .
everyone !
everyone , the cup's here !
lucy ellen , my dear , you're up there ... with no panties !
i think our movement has started to crack up .
and what a crack !
attention , subversive terrorists and primitive savages !
hand over the jules rimet trophy and commit suicide !
not necessarily in that order !
holy cow , man !
we're gonna die !
we've had it !
and not necessarily in that order .
it's no use , the troops will never lay their hands on this cup !
are you sure , man?
sure , look .
they're sinking in quicksand generated by computer graphics !
but that's terrible !
you're telling me !
it could be so much more realistic !
if it was an american movie , it would be far better !
manso , we're going to die !
i know how to survive in desperate situations .
i'll grab that creeper .
jump on my back and hold tight !
that's no creeper !
yuck !
we're dying just because you weren't man enough ... to hold the indian's creeper !
i'm a general of the brazilian armed forces !
i'd never hold the member of a primitive being and inferior race !
inferior?
that big?
manso , you've gotta be kidding !
the end
what , that's it?
that's the ending?
i thought this film was a comedy .
sure is .
give me a break !
folks , the film needn't end like that .
make up a new ending !
champagne .
champagne .
wow , what a great happy ending !
we're in first class !
would you like a shrimp?
wow , look at the size of that shrimp .
is it from jamaica?
lucy ellen , my dear , now that it's all over ... promise me one thing .
you'll never go out without your panties again !
don't worry , general , i'll take care of her .
lucy , do as your father says .
go in there and put these on .
wow , wladimir , you're so romantic .
you know , that was the first time ... a man ever asked me to put my panties on .
wait , we can't marry now .
you're only 13 .
i'm woody allen .
we'll have to wait a bit .
your attention , please .
we've just lost all our engines .
we'll try to make an emergency landing .
our chances of survival are minimal .
please , place your id in your pocket ... to help with the identification of the bodies .
oh , my oscar !
where's my oscar?
thank you for flying with this airline .
if you have any question , our ground staff ... will be happy to direct you to the nearest cemetery .
just kidding !
where's my oscar?
gee .
that shrimp from jamaica really made me high .
i'm hallucinating that the plane crashed in the jungle !
yeah !
far out , man !
oh !
wladimir , thank god you're alive .
oh , darling , are you all right?
no way , all his clothes are torn !
wladimir , you'll catch your death of cold .
put on your cardigan , son .
and the cup?
where's the cup?
we've lost the cup !
easy , general .
everything's groovy .
amid all the confusion ...
i managed to grab the cup and put it in this bag .
wow , great .
the film hasn't even finished , and we've already won an oscar !
people , don't go , it's time for the debate .
the film is about the 70's .
back then ... films were always followed by debates .
so , has anyone a question?
you can ask anything you like .
a person there has a question .
i have a question .
where are the toilets?
serious .
does anyone have a question about the film?
about the film?
i have one .
if i wanna watch the next session , is it free?
folks , this is serious .
we took ages making this film .
a question anyone?
i have one .
there's a mistake in this film .
you know when the terrorists are escaping ... and meet that drunk guy?
a very modern car passes ... a car that wasn't around at that time .
you're right .
in those days they didn't have ... such modern and sophisticated cars as the polo sedan .
but volkswagen merchandising did exist .
buddy , i'm a film critic ... and , like ...
i thought the explosions in this film were really phony .
how about that one , better?
great .
another question .
i haven't a question , but i'm a fan of yours .
could i take a picture with you?
sure , come on up .
for real?
hey , what's up?
hi .
ouch !
hey , someone pinched my ass !
what's the problem?
you're a fan .
sure , but that doesn't mean you can pinch my ass .
pretty lousy fan if you won't even let us pinch your ass .
really !
