yeah .
i guess now we know .
look , dick .
take personal charge of a rescue team and keep the survivors isolated .
crazy situation .
yes , sir .
you know what i want .
i understand .
keep the fighters airborne to cover the rescue .
aye , aye , skipper .
now track and report all movements of thejapanese task force .
aye , aye , sir .
do you still think it's a dream?
it's a nightmare .
let go !
forget the damn dog !
boss , 36 .
go ahead , 36 .
we got two survivors and now we're waiting to pick up kag .
kag?
what the hell is he doing in the water?
damned if i know .
charlie !
you all right , ma'am?
how you feeling , sir?
what the hell kind of machine is this thing?
and what's your ship , commander?
it's an aircraft carrier , sir .
i'm air wing commander richard owens .
sam chapman .
senator samuel chapman?
that's right .
sure am glad you were out here .
yes , sir .
okay , senator , watch yourself .
watch your head .
all right , take it easy .
hang on to me , sir .
you'll be just fine .
it's all right , ma'am .
go with him .
i'll take the dog , commander .
little bastard .
corporal !
mind the store , ray .
i'm going forward .
holy cow .
it's the wholejapanese fleet .
have these things returned to thejapanese pilot .
get this translated .
captain's on the bridge .
mr. lasky .
gentlemen .
captain's off the bridge .
we can't ignore it any longer .
every man on this ship knows that we have radar and visual contact with a japanese fleet approaching pearl harbor on december 6 , 1941 .
now , what do we do about it?
skipper , what we do about it is blow them out of the water .
the u. s. s. <i>nimitz</ i> declares war on thejapanese empire?
that's what we'd be doing .
but they haven't attacked pearl harbor yet .
the only evidence we have that they intend to is in the history books .
it opens up some amazing possibilities .
think of the firepower of the u. s. s. <i>nimitz</ i> back in 1941 .
what kind of possibilities , mr. lasky?
possibilities for the future , mr. owens .
think of the history of the next 40 years .
i have a suspicion history will be a little more difficult to beat than you imagine , mr. lasky .
i'm talking about the classic paradox of time .
imagine , for example , i go back in time to meet my own grandfather
long before he got married , before he had children .
we have an argument , and i kill him .
now , if that happens , how am i ever gonna be born?
and if i can never be born , how can i go back in history and meet my very own grandfather?
i'm not half the theorist you are , mr. lasky but i still have a gut instinct that things only happen once .
and if they have happened , then there's nothing we can do to change them
nor should we try .
how are you gonna avoid it?
it's already happening , and we're already involved .
for christ's sake , what is this?
some half ass princeton debating society?
we are in a war situation .
this is a united states warship or at least it used to be .
or will be .
or what the hell ever .
oh , goddamn it , you can drive yourself crazy trying to think about this stuff .
jesus , i must be dreaming !
now , hold it .
all right .
let's all calm down .
let's take it one step at a time and by the book .
if the united states of america falls under attack our job is to defend her in the past , present or future .
and after that?
after that , we take our orders from the commander in chief of the united states armed forces .
franklin delano roosevelt?
everything all right here?
you in command of this ship?
oh , hardly .
no , i'm a doctor .
ship's commander is captain yelland .
i'm sure he'll be down to see you as soon as possible .
i certainly hope so .
meanwhile , you both seem
none the worse for your little mishap .
mishap?
you call getting a boat shot out from under you and three people dead a mishap?
are we at war?
is that what happened?
i'm not in a position to ...
am i glad to see you .
doctor would you please inform the captain that senator samuel chapman cochairman of the senate defense committee would like to see him at once?
of course , senator .
doctor , i believe i said at once .
first , a vitamin shot .
now , if you'll both roll up your sleeves .
senator .
no , goddamn it !
now , you can take up your needles , doctor and whatever's in them and get the hell out of here !
corporal?
what the hell are we , prisoners?
holy shit .
<i>smoking lamp is lighted</ i> <i>in all authorized spaces . </ i>
son of a ...
so , history may be tougher to beat than i imagined .
you're becoming a real pain in the ass , lasky .
you take an awful lot of risks for someone who's supposed to be intelligent .
do i?
the attack on pearl harbor was far from a surprise for many people among them , the prominent and ambitious samuel s. chapman who had only two weeks before publicly argued for an increase in our strength in the pacific .
ironically , the senator disappeared and was presumed dead following the attack he had foreseen so clearly .
had he lived , it's very possible
chapman could have been roosevelt's running mate in the 1944 election and upon his death , the next president of the united states .
now if that doesn't come under the heading of trying to beat history
i don't know what does .
lasky , i realized who we had the moment i heard his name .
why'd you keep it to yourself?
i don't have your appetite for playing god with the world .
what was i supposed to do , throw him back in the sea?
at least that would have preserved the natural order of history as you've written it .
go to hell , lasky .
go to hell yourself .
i wanna meet chapman .
goddamn it .
if this wasn't happening to me , i wouldn't believe it .
who the hell are these people?
the navy .
yeah , the navy , yeah .
but what part of it?
i've never seen machines like they got onboard this thing .
and where have they been developing aircraft like that?
the navy would have to appear before my committee and i've never even heard a whisper about it .
rocket planes and that thing they pulled us out of the sea with .
and naming this ship after chester nimitz , an active duty admiral .
what the hell's going on here?
yeah , roosevelt .
he owns the military .
that's it .
that's exactly who .
f. d. r. has wanted the united states in this war since it started but he knows there's no way it's gonna happen except in response to an attack .
you always said thejapanese would attack .
that's right .
and who's sitting out here with no press while the white house takes all the credit for raising the alarm and being ready to hit back?
obviously , we are .
goddamn it !
anything?
whoever he is , he's either too scared or too well briefed to talk about it .
excuse me .
all right , corporal .
commander , i demand to know why we're being held prisoners .
here wait .
i got him .
jesus christ !
no , don't !
oh , my god .
the prisoner has shot one , maybe two of your men .
move in !
captain , prisoner grabbed a weapon .
he shot one of my men , maybe two .
we're in position .
the area is sealed off .
stand by .
get lieutenant kajima up here on the double .
can't we get a translator down here , for god's sakes?
how the hell do we know what he's saying if we can't understand him?
we need a translator to tell him we need a translator .
maybe that's just what he's trying to tell us .
all right , dick , lieutenant kajima is here .
put it on the box .
ask him what he wants .
he wants access to a radio , sir .
does he say why?
because he wants to warn his commander about us .
he repeats the demand .
or else?
he will kill again .
do you think there's a chance they might believe him?
there's no chance if things remain the way they are .
tell him we agree .
you son of a ...
no !
don't shoot !
back off !
don't shoot !
back off !
back off !
don't shoot !
what the hell's going on down there?
he says one more attempt to trick him and the girl is dead .
there'll be no tricks .
he can use the radio room if he frees the girl .
<i>says he doesn't believe you . </ i>
why don't you tell him what's going on here , commander?
you're an expert on what's gonna happen tomorrow tell him about it , for god's sakes .
go on , tell him !
we got nothing to lose !
go ahead , tell him .
26 november , six carriers left the coral isles north ofjapan .
the carriers were the <i>akagi , kaga , shokaku</ i>
<i>zuikaku , hiryu , soryu . </ i>
tomorrow at dawn , these carriers will send 353 planes to attack pearl harbor .
how in the hell do you know all that?
your code is " climb mount niitaka .
what's going on?
please , miss scott , don't ask me any questions .
there isn't anything i can tell you at this time .
all right?
where's charlie?
where's my dog?
we'll find him , miss scott .
he can't get off the ship .
<i>casualties will be moved</ i> <i>down to secondary triage . </ i>
i wanna get out of this bathrobe and into some clothes !
will somebody please get me some clothes?
for god's sakes !
chief , get the senator some clothes .
yes , sir .
senator , matt yelland , commanding officer .
where and how did you get all this information i've been hearing?
and is it true?
yes , sir .
did you inform pearl harbor command?
no , senator .
why the hell not?
well , the reasons are a little complicated , but , uh , believe me , senator this carrier is capable of handling any attack should it occur .
one carrier against a whole fleet?
what kind of an idiot do you take me for?
senator , calm down .
the hell with you .
tell pearl harbor what's happening here , or i'll talk to them .
very well .
dan , set up the communications in my inport cabin .
wouldn't you like to talk to them with some clothes on?
thank you , captain .
follow me , sir .
are you all right?
yes , sir , i'm fine .
can you do that , captain?
contact pearl harbor back in 1941 .
i think so .
then what do you do?
one step at a time .
yeah .
like a minefield .
this is , uh , senator samuel s. chapman of the united states senate onboard the aircraft carrier <i>nimitz . </ i>
captain yelland is here with me .
<i>you're on what? </ i>
i repeat .
i am senator samuel s. chapman onboard the u. s. s. <i>nimitz . </ i>
<i>all right, </ i> <i>whoever the hell you are</ i> <i>use of military frequencies</ i> <i>by unauthorized personnel is a felony . </ i>
now just a minute here , sir .
<i>as we have no aircraft carrier</ i> nimitz <i>and no captain yelland</ i>
<i>i suggest , asshole , that you stop</ i> <i>impersonating some other asshole</ i> <i>and get off the air . </ i>
<i>you're wasting our time . </ i>
how dare you talk to me that way !
captain , tell him who you are .
speak to them !
you , what are you doing here?
you're a civilian .
yes , sir , i'm with the department of def ...
i mean , the navy department .
that's more like it .
what's going on here?
i'm afraid i'm just an observer here , sir .
i couldn't tell you anything more than you already know .
what's happening here?
who are you people?
join him in his inport cabin .
thank you .
i'll wait outside while you change .
please , i really don't want to be left alone right now .
i'll just be a minute .
just exactly what is it you do for the senator , miss scott?
i work for him , commander .
i'd like to think i'm more than just a secretary .
i write most of his speeches , and in general , i'm his assistant .
it's quite an accomplishment for a woman in your day ... this day and age .
let me tell you something .
i'm ambitious and very capable .
that's a combination that's not much appreciated .
it's a man's world .
i'm sure you'll agree .
it certainly is , miss scott .
i spent a lot of time trying to hide the way i look hoping to be recognized for my ability .
how's it going so far?
well , let me put it this way .
if the way i look gets me in the door , then god help them when i get through .
you're a remarkable woman , miss scott .
shall we?
yeah .
<i>enemy fleet bears 042 degrees . </ i>
captain , they bear 042 degrees range 182 miles , course 180 , speed 12 .

<i>35 degrees , 17 miles north, </ i> <i>northwest of pearl . </ i>
laurel , are you all right?
miss scott , i'm matt yelland , skipper of this ship .
thank you for your hospitality , captain but i insist you fly miss scott and myself to pearl harbor immediately .
very well .
lieutenant .
yes , sir .
follow this officer .
he'll see that you're fully equipped and then escort you to the hangar deck .
thank you , captain .
charlie?
forget about the dog .
he'll be all right .
wait a minute , captain .
i think you're making a big mistake here .
that man mysteriously disappeared on december 7 , 1941 .
that's today , sir .
now , at the present time , he is the front running candidate for the vice presidential spot on the democratic ticket in 1944 .
and if he survives , he's almost certain to become the president of the united states when roosevelt dies in april of 1945 .
sir , don't you think he'd be a whole lot safer to stay on the ship for the time being?
mr. lasky , my job is to make decisions here , now not worry about what politician may be in the white house
four years from now or 40 years ago .
but , sir ...
and right now , i don't like having two civilians on my ship when i'm about to do battle .
you've got three civilians .
mr. lasky , you're free to go with them if you like .
dick .
just got enough time to drop them off on a deserted spot on this island .
not pearl , sir?
hell , no .
they'll be a whole lot safer there .
we'll equip them to look after themselves till it's over .
i'll feel a lot easier with them off my hands .
yes , sir .
be sure you're back by 0700 .
i want my best man commanding that strike force .
yes , sir .

in the past few hours , many things have happened but rumors of nuclear attacks and a third world war are totally untrue .
