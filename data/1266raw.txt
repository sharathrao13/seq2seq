united airlines flight number 80 1 to narita
united airlines flight number 80 1 to narita is now announcing final boarding .
you can't .
that is mine .
you can get so confused .
viktor?
well , hi .
please .
how are you?
good .
man .
i am so sorry about what happened last time , asking you out like that .
i'm so used to guys trying to grab my ass at 30, 000 feet that when i meet somebody that doesn't , i don't know how to react .
let's just start over .
yes , ok .
are you coming or going?
i don't know .
both .
tell me about it .
napoleon?
yeah .
i read a lot of history books .
they're long and cheap .
like 1 200 pages for $9 . 99 .
you can't beat that .
but napoleon?
yeah .
he's one of my favorites .
you know what saved napoleon's life?
no .
his ego .
ego?
yes .
after he loses the battle of waterloo ,
napoleon isolates himself on the tiny island of saint helena .
he's very depressed and decides to take his own life .
but napoleon believes himself to be of such superhuman strength that he takes six times the amount of poison needed to do the job .
his stomach is so full up with poison that his body rejects it , and he doesn't die .
see?
ego .
saved his life .
maybe he need glasses .
glasses?
yes .
to read words on bottle .
poison .
it's funny you should say that .
rumor has it that napoleon was farsighted .
there you go .
there you go .
there you go .
and there you go .
i think we're rewriting history right here .
why don't we talk about it over lunch?
oh , my god , i can't believe it .
