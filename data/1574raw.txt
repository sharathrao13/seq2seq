solarls part one
chris !
come here !
you're just in time .
he takes a walk every morning for at least an hour .
he has been working too hard , all night sometimes .
this science of solaristics of his !
he reminds me of a bookkeeper making up his accounts .
we expected you yesterday .
he wanted to run away when he saw me .
hello !
how do you do?
i guess i shouldn't have bothered you today .
how old we have grown !
i'm only now beginning to realize it .
everything will depend on his initial report from the station .
every message we receive is confusing or incomprehensible .
if he confirms for us that the study shouldn't continue , the station can be taken out of solaris's orbit .
i understand .
you promised to talk to him .
i've brought the film .
yes , of course .
would you mind keeping the boy for a few days?
anna will be pleased to have him .
she'll have more free time now .
when does he leave?
by this time tomorrow , he'll already be gone .
it's very pleasant here .
this house looks like my grand father's house .
i liked it very much .
and so we built this one just like it .
i don't care much for new things .
well , i better get going .
i've an awful lot to do .
don't you want to see this?
i've already seen it many times .
twenty one days after the launch of our expedition , radio biologist vishnyakov and physicist fechner went on an exploration mission over the solaris ocean in an air vehicle .
when they failed to return , we ordered a search .
the fog was too dense , and we had to call the search off .
all of the rescue craft returned to the station except the helicopter piloted by burton .
he came back only after the dark had set in .
he immediately ran to his quarters , obviously in a state of shock .
it was so unusual for a man who had been flying for 1 1 years .
he had recovered in a couple of days , but he would never leave the station .
and he refused to approach the window overlooking the ocean .
while under medical care in a clinic he offered to make a statement of great importance , one which he felt could affect the whole future of project solaris .
very well , let's hear his story .
now is the time to let burton talk .
the first time i descended below a thousand feet ,
i had trouble maintaining altitude , because the wind had come up .
all my efforts were required in operating the ship .
i wasn't watching outside .
as a result , i entered the fog bank .
was that an ordinary fog?
it was like nothing i'd ever seen before .
it seemed to be a colloidal substance , a gluey mass .
all the windows were coated .
because of the fog's resistance i began to lose altitude .
where i supposed the sun would be , the fog glowed like fire .
half an hour later , i emerged into a large open space .
the patch was round , about a few hundred meters across .
at that moment i observed great changes in the ocean .
the water became still , and the surface looked transparent .
a sort of yellow mucus started to congeal under it .
when it rose up , it glistened like glass .
then it began to boil , and a frothy crust appeared on top .
the surface was brown like burned sugar syrup .
this substance solidified into big lumps , giving shape to all sorts of figures .
i was being drawn to the fog bank , so i had to struggle against this force for some time .
when i looked down again ,
i saw a sort of garden .
a garden?
quiet , please .
i could see vegetation , hedges , acacia trees , narrow paths .
all of this same substance .
and all these trees and plants , did they have leaves?
those bushes , acacias?
they looked like they were made of plastic , but in real life proportions .
all of a sudden cracks started to appear .
the boiling began again , all was in froth .
you'll be able to see it for yourselves .
everything i saw will be on the film .
then i suggest we interrupt the hearing and look at it with our own eyes .
yes , show us the film .
it's very interesting .
is that all?
yes , that's all there is .
but we don't understand .
your film is nothing but clouds !
that must be the fog i was talking about .
i'm as surprised as you are .
all this might be the result of the bio magnetic current of the solaris ocean acting on burton's conscience .
we know these currents to be not only a gigantic cerebral system , but also to be capable of generating thought .
that is a hypothesis that has not been confirmed .
weren't you ill on that particular day?
oh , this next part is pointless .
we'll pick up here . ... i saw something floating .
i thought that it looked like fechner's space suit .
i kept circling the spot to make sure i wouldn't lose sight of it .
suddenly i could see the form rise slightly , as iftreading the waters .
i could see the man , he wasn't wearing a space suit , and he moved .
you mean it was human?
yes , human .
you saw his face?
yes .
what man?
who was he?
it was an infant .
did you recognize it?
i'd never seen it before .
when i circled nearer , what i saw was monstrous .
what do you mean?
at first i couldn't make it out , but then it became clear that it was incredibly huge .
it was twelve feet tall .
its eyes were blue , its hair was dark .
if you're not feeling well , we can recess the hearing .
i will continue .
it was absolutely naked , as if new born .
and it was moist , or rather slippery .
its skin was glistening .
it rose and fell with the waves , but it was moving by itself .
the whole thing was repugnant .
wait a minute , there isn't very much more .
... burton's statements would appear to be the expression of a hallucinatory complex , induced by atmospheric influences of the planet , plus obscure symptoms to which the brain's cortical substance contributed in some measure through the excitation of associated zones .
this report in no way reflects the actual facts .
or almost in no way .
there's a different opinion offered by professor messenger who believes that the information supplied by burton could be true and needs to be thoroughly studied .
i saw everything i described with my own eyes !
i would dare to venture another opinion .
we are on the verge of an immense discovery , and it would be unwise to be influenced by the fact that we base our decision upon the observations of an unqualified layman .
every explorer may well envy this pilot , his presence of mind , his talents of observation .
moreover , given the recent information , we are bound morally to press forward with our probes .
i can understand how professor messenger feels , however let's look back at the long road we've traveled .
for all our work , the solaris probes are back where we began .
years of effort have proven useless .
all we know about solaris reminds me of a mountain of separate facts which we are unable to squeeze into the framework of any conception .
well , we're even worse off today , as regards the essential .
solaristics is degenerating .
the essential question is far more serious than just solaristics .
we're probing the very frontier of human knowledge .
by artificially establishing a knowledge frontier , we limit our concept of the infinity of man's knowledge .
and if our movement is not forward , do we not risk moving backward?
what do you mean by saying that the information supplied by me is in no way reflects the actual facts?
i saw all this with my own eyes .
it means that some real phenomena could have triggered your hallucinating .
in windy weather it's very easy to mistake a swinging bush for a living creature .
to say nothing of a strange planet !
there's nothing offending in it for you .
what action are you going to take in view of prof. messenger's opinion?
practically none at all .
our research in this area will be discontinued .
i have a statement to make .
it's not my reputation but the spirit of the expedition that you offend ...
well , et cetera ...
it's considered to be good manners now to laugh whenever burton's report is mentioned .
we've known you a long time , but still i know so little about you .
you were very handsome then .
you don't mean that , but thanks anyway .
well , chris , what do you think about all this?
i would like to speak to your son alone .
i hate to look like an idiot before you once more .
i'll wait for you outside by the swing .
he looks ridiculous , your burton .
don't say that .
he's obviously ill at ease .
he feels he's intruding on us .
if he decided to come , it's because he considers the matter so important .
i didn't want to see outsiders today any more than you did .
we don't talk to each other often enough .
it's good to hear you say that .
even on the last day .
the last day ...
when the farewells are overdone , you feel awful afterwards .
let's meet after dinner .
we need to talk .
and still , why did you invite this burton fellow today of all days?
where are the guests going to sleep?
upstairs , i guess .
well , i'll be down by the swing .
but perhaps ...
just a second .
the question of where they're going to sleep can wait !
listen , chris ...
what's the matter?
what is it down there , standing in the garage and looking at me?
it's just a horse .
i've seen it already .
come on !
he's very gentle .
look how beautiful he is !
i think that solaristics is at an impasse as a result of irresponsible fantasizing .
i'm only interested in truth , but you want to convince me of your point of view .
i can't draw conclusions based on " reasons of heart " .
i'm not a poet .
my problem is simple : either end the research , withdrawing the station from orbit and legalizing the crisis in solaristics , or take extreme measures ,
like bombarding the ocean with high intensity beams .
no , not that !
didn't you want to continue the research at any price?
and you want to destroy that which we aren't capable of understanding?
no , i don't advocate knowledge at any price .
knowledge is only valid when it rests on a foundation of morality .
man is the only agent who renders science immoral .
don't forget hiroshima .
then don't make science immoral !
it's strange ...
there's nothing strange about it .
even you can't be sure that all you had seen weren't just hallucinations .
thank you for your time .
we have nothing more to say to each other .
is anything the matter?
i'm leaving .
leaving?
he is a bookkeeper , not a scientist .
we're friends , burton , but you shouldn't say that about him !
we've known each other for 20 years .
it had to end someday , i guess .
are you leaving the child?
why did you have to offend him?
you're heartless .
it's dangerous to send your kind to the cosmos .
everything is far too fragile there !
the earth somehow manages to put up with men of your sort , though at what cost to humanity !
are you jealous of the fact that he will be the one to bury me , not you?
it'd been established that the solaris ocean is a peculiar kind of brain .
later , even a more daring hypothesis was put forward , that is the ocean is a thinking substance .
for years this hypothesis could not have been substantiated .
this program is about solaris .
very few true believers have remained .
first of all , they are those who are connected with the station .
on the station for a 85 strong crew , only three men are still working .
they are astrobiologist sartorius , cyberneticist snout and physiologist guibariane who is dealing with the problem ...
i'm calling from the city .
burton !
anna , please , we need to talk .
what i talked to chris about was not important .
i should have told him about messenger who had a different opinion at that meeting .
he got very much interested in fechner who died in solaris ocean .
it turned out that fechner has an orphaned son , he had left his family .
messenger and i paid a visit to fechner's widow .
i saw this child with my own eyes .
you never told me about that .
i didn't have a chance .
all right , what about it?
he looked exactly like the child i'd seen on solaris .
except that he wasn't twelve feet tall .
it wouldn't be good for him to think about it before the launch , but he should remember this when he's there .
there's no point in keeping these .
the only ones to be kept are those in my room .
all my research notes , my thesis ...
i wonder why we kept all these?
should something happens , i'll find someone to take care of them .
oh , don't look for the film with the campfire .
i'm taking it with me .
oh , sure , do that ...
ready , kelvin?
ready !
you have nothing to worry about .
have a good trip .
when is the lift off?
you're already under way !
station solaris !
can you do something?
i seem to be losing stability .
where are you all?
you've got company !
doctor snout?
snout?
i'm kelvin , psychologist .
it appears you weren't expecting me .
did you receive the radiogram?
yes , certainly .
why are you so upset?
i'm sorry ...
where is guibariane?
and sartorius?
sartorius is in his quarters .
guibariane is dead .
dead?
he committed suicide ...
i knew guibariane .
it's not like him to ...
he was in a state of profound depression .
since these mysterious disorders began ...
maybe you'd better rest , take a bath .
you may take any room .
come here in an hour .
i'm impatient to meet with guibariane ...
i mean sartorius .
i doubt if he'll let you in .
he's up in his laboratory .
listen , i'm aware that something extraordinary has happened , and perhaps i ...
doctor kelvin ...
you see ...
please , come in an hour .
go now , and rest .
now there're only three of us on the station : you , me and sartorius .
you know what we look like from our photographs .
if you see anything out of the ordinary , not me or sartorius , try not to lose your head .
what would i see?
that depends on you .
hallucinations?
no ... but don't forget .
forget what?
that we're not on earth .
why don't we have our talk tonight?
no , let's make it tomorrow morning !
a. gulbarlane
human belng
to c. kelvln
hello , chris .
i still have a little time left .
there're certain things i must tell you , that i must warn you about .
i suppose you've been told what happened to me .
if not , snout or sartorius can tell you the details .
what happened to me , it matters little .
the trouble is that no one can really explain it .
i'm afraid that what's happened to me is only a beginning .
i wouldn't wish it , of course , but it may happen to all of you .
here , it may happen to anyone , for sure .
but don't think that i've gone mad .
you know me well .
if i have enough time , i'll tell you why i did this .
if it does happen to you , you will know it's not madness .
that's the main thing .
as for continuing our program of research ,
i'm of the same opinion as sartorius .
bombard the plasma of the ocean by high powered x rays .
it's prohibited , but there's no other choice .
we or rather you will be drawn in .
it may offer a way to break this deadlock .
it's your only chance to establish contact with this monster .
there's no other solution left .
if you ...
doctor sartorius , my name is kelvin .
i arrived two hours ago .
look , i'm in a ridiculous situation here .
either you open up , or i'll break the door !
all right , i'll open the door , but don't come in .
i'll come out .
my name is kelvin .
you must have heard of me .
i worked with guibariane .
dr. snout told me about guibariane ...
i can't believe it .
so , you know the story .
yes , it's horrible .
i have no details , i only know he's dead .
all of us may die .
but he insisted upon being buried on the earth .
guibariane wanted to be in the earth , with the worms .
have you ever heard of burton?
yes , he was on the search party for fechner .
fechner died a magnificent death , and guibariane was a coward .
please ...
he's dead !
whyjudge him?
duty to the truth is the only concern that should count .
you are misguided in your search .
look ...
this courage you pretend to is only inhumanity .
go away .
you're obviously overemotional .
you must adapt yourself .
good health to you .
i saw sartorius and we spoke .
i don't find him very likable .
he's a very talented scientist .
i'm afraid i don't feel so well .
there's nothing wrong with you , but you won't listen to advice .
aside from the three of us , is there anyone else on the station?
did you see anything?
what were you warning me against?
what did you see?
a human being?
was she real?
can she be touched or felt , or wounded , hurt?
when did you see her the last time , today?
and you , how do i know who you are?
shhh ...
where did she come from?
leave me alone !
you're afraid ...
don't worry , i'm not going to think you're insane .
me , insane?
oh god , you know so little ...
madness would be a blessing !
snout , listen ...
it's all so absurd .
they don't understand anything .
they're sure that i've gone mad .
though it's something like insanity , i've got to do this .
i'm afraid that snout and sartorius will try to force their way in .
they don't understand what they're doing .
i'm frightened , chris ...
i can't ...
no one will ever understand ...
guibariane , open the door !
don't be a fool !
that's us , snout and sartorius !
we want to help you !
they say they want to help me .
all right , quit knocking .
i'm my own judge .
have you seen her?
try to understand , chris , i'm not mad .
it has to do with my conscience .
i really hoped you'd get here in time .
how did you ...
it's so good !
but you can't possibly ...
how did you find out where i was?
what do you mean " find out "?
don't , chris , that tickles .
where are my shoes?
no ... they're not there .
who's this?
chris , this is me ...
you know ...
i have a feeling
as if i've forgotten something .
what's the matter with me? ..
do you love me?
why do you have to ask , hari , as if you didn't know .
i've got to go out .
i won't be long , wait here .
can't i come with you?
no .
i'll be back soon .
no !
why?
i don't know ...
i can't ...
you can't what?
i feel like i've got to be with you ... all the time , to see you ...
why are you being so childish?
i've work to do , hari .
you're right , i'm acting childish .
as for you , you're as nervous as snout .
as who?
as doctor snout .
how do you know ...
i've got to go .
if you want , you can come with me .
but you won't be able to get into a suit with your dress on .
help me , i can't do it by myself .
why do you keep staring at me?
