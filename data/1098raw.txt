last time i checked .
how can i help you?
i just came all the way from salt lake city .
rough town .

but the guys who own the nightclub sold it .
i'm dead broke .
i need a job .
i want to go home .
can you help me out?
sorry , i can't help you .
i'm sure there's a bunch of clubs that can use a good singer , but we got a dj .
take it easy .
i'm sure they could , but my moon card expired ... ... and i was told you were the one person in town who might overlook that .
who told you something foolish like that?
you know my father , nicholas lake?
never heard of him .
nicky sticks?
that's your father?
unbelievable .
that's something .
normally i don't call in favors , but my dad did save your life back in '76 .
he didn't save my life , i saved his life .
and i lost a fine automobile in the process .
unless you got a new plymouth with my name on it , i got nothing to say .
so , good night .
thanks , dad .
i should have known .
i'm sorry .
maybe i got something .

only the slow ones .
somebody is coming in .
sorry , fellows , we're closed .
we're here to see mr. nash .

i was wondering when you all was going to get to me . $10 million .

i won't sell my club .
lf i have my way , no one here will sell their place ... ... because we like this town the way it is .

rex crater does not like to be disappointed .
i'll just have to send mr. crater a case of scotch !

but thank you , anyway .
i got it down to a pretty good science .

i wanted to thank you again for the job .

well , i am mentioning it .
thank you .
you're very welcome .
let me get this , okay?
hello?
hello , nash .
don't call me this time of night .
what's wrong with you?
you know tony francis?
i knew him back when he was anthony frankowski .
we were like brothers .
we grew up together .
me and anthony frankowski , who would later become
i'll tell you a real funny story in a second .
hello?
just wanted to give you one last chance to change your mind .
look , no now and no tomorrow .
no means no .
leave me alone .
now , you look
clown .
who was that?
one of rex crater's boys , trying to buy me out .
why is he so set on buying your club?
because they're about to approve gambling in this town .
lf crater gets his way , they'll turn the moon into a big casino .
you can't sell your club till i make enough money to get back home .
i'll let him know the next time he calls that you got to get your money first .
you all right?
you okay?
yeah .
what happened?
i don't know !

bruno , look what they did to my place !
pluto !

bruno , i think that's one of them .
i'll intercept the call .
nash is alive .
he took off after jimmy , who's headed for the vac .
be ready for him .
what's the vac?
the perfect vacuum , at the corner of glenn avenue and fifth .
why?
didn't you hear the phone call?
i'm sorry , i cannot listen and hear at the same time .
you see , i'm a '63 .
only later models can do that !
pluto's in trouble .
come on .
trouble?
ls that as fast as you go?
i'm a '63 !
i'm at top speed !
get out of the way !
reset .
reset .
reset .
you try to shake me down , then you blow up my club?
you blew up my wood barstools !
you know how hard it is to get wood on the moon?
shit !
you want to play games?
you have to shoot around your boy !
it's easier to shoot through him .
shit !
pluto , it's a trap !
yeah , no kidding !
did you ever shoot a gun before?
time to go , bruno !
all clear , boss !
come on !
bruno , heel !
you are really something , you know that?
thank you .
you walked right into a trap any idiot could see from a mile away .
i was walking right out until you came along .
really?
yes , really .
you put your neck on the line , i appreciate that .
but in the future , not that there'll be a future , if i need your help , i'll ask .
don't worry about it , i'm getting out of here .
i saved your life twice .
least you can do is loan me enough money so i can go home .
i would , but they'll be looking for you at every bus station and shuttle launch .
me?
they don't even know what i look like .
every club in this city has a biometric camera system .
they took hundreds of pictures of you .
they know what you look like .
only way you're going home now is in a box .
that's just great .
now what?
after you .
hey , roy .
pluto !
what are you doing here?
my place is getting redecorated and i need a place overnight .
sure !
3d .
the code is 4 5 7 .
thanks , roy .
so , this is the garden of paradise .
my , my .
lf this is too glitzy for you ... ... tomorrow we can get a room at the garden of eden .
they got a bathroom on every floor .
i hate the moon .
know why mooners can't stand earthlings?
you think everything back earth is better and can't stop talking about it .
i went back earth once and the air smelled funny .
sneezing all the time , rained every day , bugs and shit everywhere .
you know the only thing i liked about it?
you could see the moon at night?
bingo .
ls something wrong with your toaster?
he's all right .
he's just recharging .
can he hear us?
not while he's charging .
shouldn't your bodyguard be able to keep up with you on the way to a gunfight?
you might want to think about trading him in .
i can't trade in bruno .
we got a history together .
i got 20 years of rill hopping experience wired into him .
rill hopping?
well , that's a ....
smuggling .
that's what i went to jail for .
he ain't the fastest thing in the world , but he got me out of lots of tight squeezes .
a little smokier than usual .
he's a fire hazard .
he's all right .
where are you going?
i got to go talk to an old friend , see what i can find out .
what am i supposed to do?
make sure bruno don't burn the place down .
you're leaving me alone with him?
i left .
pluto !
you're getting kind of old , rowland .
you should be so lucky .
every lowlife in town is looking to whack you .
i'm a popular guy .
what can i say?
you want to lose some money?
no , but you'll lose money .
we'll play some eight ball , regular stakes .
i will kindly empty your wallet for you .
you're on .
how is your mother?
still breaking hearts .
pizza time .
she should have married me .
you should have went to the gym and lost weight .
i'd have lost the weight if she married me .
otherwise , what's the point?
i really need your help .
i got to get to rex crater .
forget it .
nobody gets to him .
who the hell is this guy?
a myth , an enigma .
he lives in a penthouse above the lunar grand hotel .
never comes out .
you was a cop for 20 years .
you got to have some kind of idea who he is .
some people think he's a clone .
there was a clone doctor named runa pedanken .
made a big name for herself creating a basketball team from one old guy .
the air jordans .
right after cloning was outlawed back earth , pedanken came up here .
she was the best in her field until she got herself murdered .
that was about eight years ago .
i'm going to need to hack into police files .
you mean , you need me to hack into police files .
i thought you'd never ask .
pedanken , runa . lnitiate global search .
file deleted .
sorry , that's all there is .
she wasn't doing this by herself .
who worked with her?
she had an assistant .
we questioned her for days about the murder .
got nothing .
that's because you have no finesse .
who is she and where do i find her?
mona zimmer .
runs a body alteration shop on microsoft and sixth .
that's what i love about you .
i ask you a simple question , four hours later , i get a simple answer .
boss?
where did the boss go?
i don't know .
out .
he said to wait for him here .
out?
he never goes anywhere without me .
and i heard that toaster crack .
bruno , give me that old badge you got .
who are we going to arrest?
i need your help .
sure .
where are we going?
it's just got to be the two of us .
you go next time .
promise .
that's gratitude for you .
we were hoping that for our anniversary we could get a brand new us .
how romantic .
you're in luck !
i just happen to have a cancellation .
fantastic !
are you all original or have you been previously improved?
all original .
really?
yes , from top to bottom .
okay , then .
well , what exactly did you have in mind?
we were thinking we could start with some ass resculpting for her ... ... to get a little more bubblage
i happen to have a great ass !
i'm not saying your ass isn't great .
we'd like something
could you do something about his big mouth?
do you have any catalogues?
maybe we could get some ideas .
come this way , i'll show you exactly what you want .
thank you .
come on , honey .
look at the asses on the wall .
yeah .
don't push it .
let's start with some of the basic body types .
here's one i think you'll really like .
the amazon .
i don't like that .
that makes me look like a big dufus , doesn't it?
where would we buy clothes?
i don't want to be the big dufus .
good point .
let me try again .
this one i'm particularly proud of .
the venice beach .
wait a minute .
i think you done found something there .
look at that , honey .
yeah , look at that .
look at me !
this is me?
it could be .
honey , i'm looking and i'm thinking ... ... that you need to rethink the ass enhancement .
it will work , it will help out .
what you want is to have a ....
you know?
she also needs a little more of this , too , up top .
can you fix this?
lf you could spruce these up a little .
just a little sprucier .
i know that she has ample now .
but i'm talking titties galore .
let's have the titties really flowing .
yeah , like that .
look at that .
why don't we step into my office and discuss the terms?
yes , let's go in and sign up !
look at that !
before we get started , there's a few things i'd like to talk over with you .
first of all , will you be paying in cash ... ... or would you like to take advantage of our flexible financing plan?
all in cash , all at once .
excellent !
medical records?
right here .
and police permit?
our police permits?
i think you'll find that our police permits are in order .
police permits .
sorry , no can do .
not without a police permit .
it's body alteration 101 .
you could be fugitives , killers , anybody .
no , we're just a couple trying to put the spark back in our relationship .
the idea of revealing such personal details to the police .
please , dr. zimmer?
all right .
come back tonight , 8 : 00 sharp .
but it's another $10, 000 upon completion .
all right .
then , doctor , you are busted .
give me a break .
what are you guys , the health department?
you wish we were .
listen , you got one chance .
you answer some questions for me .
and i want the truth .
okay , what do you want to know?
when you worked for runa pedanken  i never heard of her .
you want to play games?
put the cuffs on her .
come on , cuff her .
no !
just hold on !
hold the cuffs .
tell me everything you know and don't play games with me , mona .
talk to me .
what do you know?
right now .
all right , all right .
towards the end , runa was dealing with some pretty heavy characters ... ... but she didn't tell me who .
and she didn't keep any records .
but one day i walked into her office as she was showing one of the guys out ... ... and he left his briefcase behind .
the initials wzw were embossed on it ... ... in gold .
and it was made out of genuine alligator skin .
are you with me?
earth goods .
that's all i know .
i swear it .
just for the record , i have never had one complaint about my ass .
i was just playing .
i said that for the lady .
it was part of the scam .
ma , what are you doing here?
seeing that you're all right .
ma , this is dina .
dina , my mother .
you're his mother?
why , you got a problem with that?
i'm surprised .
you could easily pass for his sister .
thank you .
why are you gallivanting around?
you'll wind up dead .
i got to take care of those guys that blew up my club .
you got to get your ass off the moon !
i don't think so .
you think you're a hot shit , ex rill hopping , burned down club owning guy ... ... but once in a while , listen to your mother .
all right , i'll get off the moon !
but can i get something to eat first?
god !
bruno , get some beer and sandwiches .
and you ought to be a little nicer to your robot .
be nicer to my robot?
you been in here bitching to my moms?
gentlemen .
suite with a hot tub?
which room is nash in?
lie to me and i will blow your head off .
3d .
you take the stairs .
you two , take the elevator .
let the robots take the stairs .
you stay here .
pluto , this is roy .

we got to move out of here .
come on , this way !
bruno , check and see if we can get out the window !

rowland , it's pluto .
i got to get to the far side .
i need you to get me a spacesuit .

one for a female about 5'7 " .
i'll tell you when i get there .
this is dina .
nice to meet you .

i got that covered .
i'm arranging for some transportation .
that's it .
code generator serial number?
8 7 4 3 5 0 8 .
check .
it's not my business , but why don't we just rent a car instead of stealing one?
because you can't rent these .
what's so special about it?
it's a chrysler desoto s 5000 .
it cruises on a 14 inch cushion of air , hikes up to 64 inches in rough terrain .
it's heat and meteor resistant , with a torque compressor power thrust ... ... and a kick ass sound system .
trust me on this one .
bruno , i need an ignition chip .
this might do the trick .
it will work perfect .
got to love a place where your bodyguard and car have interchangeable parts .
smart ass .
after you .
good evening , mr. vandervoort .
james here .
aren't you early , sir?
we're surprising mrs. vandervoort with some jam and scones ... ... and picking her up at a spa on the far side .
you're not mr. vandervoort at all .
you're some hooligan trying to steal his motorcar .
i won't have it !
shut up and drive .
head for the far side .
i'll give you to the count of three before i alert the authorities .
one .
sorry , james .
you're too late .
i have disconnected your alarm relay .
so get moving , jimmy boy , or you'll have a speech impediment .
good god , i'm being stolen !
take over for a while , james .
i will not be an accomplice in this .
you're not an accomplice , you're a hostage .
do it .
i won't be intimidated .
do it !
all right .
thank you .
nice work , james .
yeah , james .
you little asshole .
i heard that .
how are you holding up?
fine .
hey , listen , i won't let anything happen to you .
i promise .
all right .
how long does the night last up here?
two weeks .
that's so depressing .
no , it's not .
it's nice .
look at this .
when i was a little boy , i used to come out here with rowland ... ... look up and count the stars , and dream about what was out there .
i never heard such drivel in my life !
what kind of refreshments you got back here?
dreadfully sorry , sir .
we weren't expecting anyone .
i know you got something .
you going to make me house it?
champagne and caviar !
don't touch those , they're for guests !
james , we are guests .
he'll get her drunk and have his way with her .
you know something?
bad luck , old boy !
we were ambushed?
ambushed?
yes , sir .
really?
well , they're just not playing fair .
any other excuses?
problems at home , cold coming on , work too stressful?
what?
nothing , sir .
good .
because the next time i talk to rex crater , i need to say nash is dead .
that's all he wants to hear .
it's as good as done .
or else you are .
get out of here .
we'll get right on it , sir .
where are we?
safe .
it's an old prospecting dome .
we found it years back .
nobody knows about it but me and bruno .
what's the temperature out here?
it's about 200 below .
balmy .
play's over .
get down here .
okay .
that was fun .
memories .
had a lot of memories in here , bruno .
look at all this junk .
what do you mean " junk "?
this is called inventory .
show a little respect .
this is what's left of my life's work .
very interesting help you have around here .
that's an old program i forgot to delete .
left it on " oops ! " i forgot that was in there .
miss me?
guess not .
she's an excellent piece of multi functional software .
lnitiate search .
convicted organized crime , earthling , initials wzw .
wzw .
no wzw .
nothing .
thank you .
thanks for nothing .
worthless computer .
how's it going?
it's not going at all .
babette made lunch .
thank you .
thank you so much .
can i help?
computer's got no information on our mystery man .
i'm starting to think that that zimmer conned us .
here's your problem .
zimmer said wzw , not mzm .
you're just looking at it upside
wait a minute .
you did it !
look at you !
you're a genius !
look what you did .
she saw it upside down .
watch this .
lnitiate search .
convicted organized crime , earthling , initials mzm .
okay .
you see?
now we have something .
open file 10 1 7 mm.
how do you feel about your acquittal , mr. marucci?
makes me proud to live in this great country where justice is still served .
with gambling to be outlawed on earth , will the giovanetto syndicate ... ... engender a consortium to perpetuate a new gambling coalition on the moon?
will the what do what to the what?
speak english , sweetheart .
will you and the other major organized crime figures on earth
organized crime?
i don't know nobody in organized crime .
listen , darling ... ... you want to ask me a question , let's sit down somewhere .
we'll open a bottle of wine , get to know each other better .
get a new dress , a nice pair of shoes .
be at my hotel around 7 : 00 .
what are you waiting for , a dance?
i forgot the stairs were there .
back it up .
let me take it in a little closer here .
and closer still .
what do you see?
so mike marucci is rex crater?
one way to find out .
that's pretty far fetched , pluto .
but i buy it .
marucci had the bucks , he had the balls .
he had the background to build moon beach .
not to mention he wouldn't mind whacking anybody who got in his way .
so i noticed .
pluto , when you make an enemy , you don't mess around .
yeah , you know me .
i'm gonna see an old buddy at the fbl , i'll get back to you .
right .
listen to that !
that's connecticut .
listen how clear .
what's this?
no , don't do that !
stop !
that's a cryogenic chihuahua !
it's a real dog?
yeah , it's very delicate .
you know it's illegal to bring pets here .
but i got a friend back in jurez who knows how to freeze dry these things .
look at that .
it's a girl .
pop that little bitch in the particle wave for two minutes on defrost ... ... she'll be running around the room .
i used to get $5, 000 a pop for these things .
where'd you do your singing back earth?
weddings , bar mitzvahs , reincarnation rituals .
the usual gigs .
i hit a rut ... ... so i sent my tape to a club i heard about up here .
figured , what the hell?

i never even met him !
he watches my show from up in his penthouse .
your jokes suck .

you wouldn't be singing if it wasn't for me , right?
come on , man .
i might know a way for you to get up into his penthouse .
after that you're on your own , pluto .
thanks .
pick up bruno and pay the damages on that slot machine .
rent a car and wait outside the front entrance of the hotel .
i might have to make a fast getaway .
but what if you don't get away?
i always get away .
come on , we'll go this way .
rex crater's private penthouse elevator is right next to mine .
there's a way for you to get from my elevator into his .
how you doing?
trust me , you'll love this .
all right , here we go .
i'll stop this so nobody bothers us .
i gotta get that later .
shit !
that's rex's elevator down there .
see?
it only stops at the subbasement and his penthouse .
my elevator only goes as low as this floor .
how do i get from one elevator to the other one?
that's what tony is here to help you with .
i'll tell you the whole thing .
back up as far as you can go , get a good running start , jump out across .
jump across to what?
the ledge !
see that ledge down there?
grab onto these wires and swing down onto the ledge .
you want me to grab hot wires?
how do you know they're hot?
look , the shit is hot !
grab the ones that aren't hot .
swing down , get down to the ledge .
then you wait an hour and a half till they bring rex's late supper up to him .
when the elevator goes by , before it passes you , you jump on top .
use this casino chip to unscrew the trapdoor on top of the elevator .
jump down inside and take out the two robot guards , pop pop !
boom !
you're alone in the elevator , you got a meeting with rex .
what's plan b?
this is plan b.
i'm here to accept mr. crater's offer .
ls that right?
it's all settled . $10 million .
we'll have to get back to you on that .
i got to get ready for my next show .
get them out of here .
sorry , your robot remains property of this casino ... ... until the damages to our slot machines are taken care of .
i'm here to pay you .

you would be a real peach if you could get me that bill .
harry , i got a bruno '63 deluxe .
wrecked a slot machine .
owner wants to pick him up .
how much they owe?
i haven't even looked at the damn thing yet .
have him check with us tomorrow morning .
what are they saying?
you'll be spending the night .
it's been fun .
excuse me .
i got to take a leak .
robots don't take leaks .
you're absolutely right .
come on .
we need to get a car .
what are you in such a hurry for?
you wanted to talk to mr. crater?
here you are .
i finally get to meet the great rex crater?
or is it mike marucci?
yeah , mike marucci .
thought you were so damn smart , i figured you out .
i should come over there and put my foot in your fat grease ball ass .
so you got it all figured out , huh?
it is a pleasure to meet me .
i'm pretty feisty , huh?
what's this , a rented tuxedo?
you know , you're old enough to own your own tuxedo .
sit down !
you know , you should be honored .
only person besides yourself to ever come up here is belcher over there .
what's going on here?
remember when they cut your appendix out eight years ago in prison?
gambling had just been outlawed on earth , so my old boss ... ... mike marucci , commissioned dr. runa pedanken to create a clone ... ... of someone who knew their way around the moon .
for what?
he was starting a gambling operation and needed someone to front for him .
someone intelligent , that he could control .
a puppet .
that didn't jive with my career plan so i sent marucci and pedanken into orbit .
then , for sentimental reasons , or because i'm a nice guy , i let you live .
until you got in my way .
let's face it , why should i keep you around?
for what?
i got your good looks , your charm and your wit .
i even got your memories .
you got my memories?
yeah .
never wondered how my people knew to look for you in your hideout?
or the paradise motel , which , by the way , is a disgusting establishment .
i'm surprised you didn't break into a rash after staying there .
next time i'll remember to find better accommodations .
mr. mogan and mr. kelp have arrived , sir .
yes .
by all means , send them in .
mr. mogan and mr. kelp .
i've been waiting for those two gentlemen .

lsn't it something?
but enough about him .
mr. mogan , i want to personally thank you for the outstanding job you've done .
thank you , sir .
it was a pleasure and an honor .
you see , when you have the experience me and my men have , it's quite easy
oh , shit .
lncompetent jackasses .
get them out of here .
i'd love to let you hang around so you can entertain me ... ... but we might have a conflict of interest .
but there's something i want you to see before i say bye bye to you .
look at that .
an excellent piece of real estate , but you never took advantage of its potential .
this
this is wrong .
that should say rex's , because this is rex's .
little america's most exclusive new casino !
tell me , what do you think?
little america is not a gambling town and pluto's isn't a casino .
i think you're a clown and you should take all this stupid casino shit out .

i guess it wasn't meant to be , huh?
bruno , you see my new bodyguard running around here?
new bodyguard?
i bought a '78 , fully loaded , out the door .
shall i begin disassembling myself .
lf you do that , how will you manage my club in 500 pieces?
manage?
but no robot has ever been in management .
you want the job or not?
oh , boss !
oh , thank you , boss !
you're the best boss on the whole moon !
you almost broke my ribs .
pull up a chair .
