notice the elegance of the proof .
it's beautiful !
if measure and symmetry are absent from any composition ,
the ruin awaits both the ingredients and the composition .
measure and symmetry are beauty and virtue the world over .
do you think he's straight?
yeah , he's too boring to be gay .
15?
yes , it is .
thank you ...
i'm releasing you a half hour early today .
i have ... an appointment .
i'm giving a lecture on my new book tonight .
you are all welcome .
thank you .
rose , get that mask off your face .
it'll clog your pores .
you're going to be late .
it's almost seven o'clock .
you bum !
three million dollars a year !
for what?
come on .
just one more out .
barry neufeld .
hi , it's rose .
hi ...
not again .
i think it's an allergic reaction to something i ate .
my throat's starting to close up .
it sounds like you're dying .
sure you're not allergic to me?
that's a terrible thing to think !
every manhattan restaurant hates me for not keeping reservations .
why don't you call me next week?
if you still want to .
feel better .
thank you .
bye .
should i start with a joke?
no , there's not enough time .
for what?
to develop a sense of humour .
and now , ladies and gentlemen , the author of " absolute truth " ,
columbia's very own professor gregory larkin .
you're going to be fine .
thank you .
i'm honoured by this warm and gracious welcome .
whether i am awake or asleep , two and three will always make five .
it does not seem possible that such a truth can be questioned .
this book has taken me over 14 years to write .
it is with sadness i say goodbye to it consuming my days and nights .
and nights ...
and as i stand here ...
in coming up ... summing up ...
excuse me , i'm feeling a little dizzy .
i thought it would feel differently .
i thought i'd know more .
i don't .
i don't know anything , really .
thank you all for coming .
what did i say?
it was fine , though you shouldn't work for a suicide hotline .
you did fine until candice came .
don't start .
i just forgot to eat .
it's natural .
she left you what , a year ago?
thank god candy left when she did , or i'd never have finished the book .
you're a guy who can't have sex and chew gum at the same time .
when i'm with someone , i tend to get a little sidetracked .
14 years?
is that sidetracked?
i bet she's still out there .
if i know candice , she's out there .
she's out there .
face her like a grown up .
don't let me go home with her .
it would be odd not to invite ...
just don't let me go home with her .
are you all right?
it was the stupid wine .
hello .
you look great .
i hope you don't mind me showing up like this on your big night .
it's just that i've been thinking so much about you lately .
do you want to go get a drink?
i'd better not .
a bite to eat?
no , i'm not hungry .
do you want me to take you home?
okay .
good to see you , henry .
but greg ...
don't leave .
aren't you staying?
well , we're done .
i still have feelings for you .
but i dumped you for another man .
and i'm still sort of with paul .
i thought that was over .
he cheated .
i wanted to feel better about myself before i see him .
that's why you're here?
well , yeah .
you were always a nice guy .
but let's face it ,
we've nothing in common except sex , and the fact you idolize me .
i really do care for you .
i just can't wind up with you .
can i call you sometime?
what for?
are you going?
no , i cancelled .
what do you want to do for dinner?
make that pasta with artichokes .
later we can figure out what to do with your hair for claire's wedding .
what is this?
look at that .
the mating ritual is both speedy and violent .
the lesser male often covers the larger female .
if unsuccessful in mounting , the male is often eaten by the female .
we're the girls of 1 400 hot talk .
felicia .
anything you want to talk about , call me ...
i don't know where to begin .
are you lonely tonight , darling?
so am i. what are you wearing?
nothing special .
can i ask you a question?
i'm just wearing a towel .
i was drying myself off , after a hot shower ...
why do women leave?
why do they leave?
especially pretty ones .
i can't do it any more .
life is very complex .
there are no guarantees .
the mathematical world is completely rational .
you think too much .
don't you want to know how big my tits are?
no !
i just want to share my life with someone .
someone i'm not sexually attracted to .
how can two people come together in lasting respect and affection?
the world's run by sex ads .
take out your own ad , i guess .
an ad?
look at me .
i'm a grown woman wearing a prom dress .
i look like an over the hill barbie doll .
and it's too tight .
i want something in my colour .
maids of honour don't wear black .
why aren't you wearing make up?
i am wearing make up .
you'd look good with a perm .
like shirley temple on crack .
where is she?
she can't stand that i'm getting all the attention .
we should've had her committed .
for excessive vanity?
how wonderful !
two compassionate daughters .
no make up today?
i am wearing make up .
what the hell are you wearing?
it's an imitation scassi .
you're my mother , not the singer .
i'll go home and change .
stop it .
we're late .
the priest is sweating .
all celibates sweat , dear .
if they didn't , they'd explode .
i bought a snack .
if i sit through this without eating , i'll pass out .
it'll only take 45 minutes .
marrying outside your faith , and on the sabbath ...
all i know about the sabbath is that bergdorff's isn't too crowded .
i want you to remember , today is my day .
behave , or i'll blow up your birth certificate into a christmas card .
i should have never encouraged you to speak .
maybe she'll look back and turn into a pillar of salt .
alex looks nervous .
i hope i'm doing the right thing .
i think you are .
the party is about to get started .
the dance floor is all yours !
okay girls , lick your lips .
tell claire i'm looking for her .
your husband's a lucky guy .
waiter !
can we have more dressing?
we were separated at birth .
two more drinks , when you can .
this looks delicious .
i can't believe he's married .
and that he chose claire over you .
i told you not to introduce them .
she was married , i didn't think .
how are you handling all this?
no more fantasies of handsome men .
there's a guy out there somewhere .
who?
barry neufeldt?
what's wrong with him , other than that he looks like gumpy?
gumby , not gumpy .
i'm no great prize , either .
you're a great person and teacher .
i think i've reached the point where you know you'll never get married .
married?
what's marriage?
a ring , a contract .
fighting , compromising .
it can be more than that .
you know what i envy about people in love?
i'd love it if someone really knew me .
what i like .
what i'm afraid of .
what kind of toothpaste i use .
i think that would really be wonderful .
hey , sister in law , having a good time?
have you seen claire?
no , i'll find her for you .
you look beautiful tonight .
i'm not just saying that .
you really do .
i heard you .
why don't you have some coffee?
i'll find claire .
alex is looking for you .
brother , it's starting already?
how could you do this?
i'll never forgive you .
yes ... !
i'm professor gregory larkin .
i'm calling about the response to my ad .
is this professor morgan?
i'm her sister .
she knows nothing .
then maybe we shouldn't talk .
no !
rose would never answer herself .
most of these guys are creeps .
but when it said you taught at columbia , something just clicked .
you have seen her picture , right?
yes .
and ...?
and what?
nothing .
great .
make way , please .
this is the scene at my sister's wedding .
she's getting drunk , regretting that she got married for the third time .
my mom's sprouting snakes from her hair in jealousy .
it was perfect ...
the divine whore , medusa and me .
what archetype am i?
the virgin mary?
thanks a lot , trevor .
no , the faithful handmaiden .
always the bridesmaid , never the bride .
it proves what jung said all along .
myths and archetypes are alive and well and living in my apartment .
as i stood beside the altar beside my sister and her husband to be ,
it struck me that this ritual , a wedding ceremony ,
is the last scene of a fairy tale .
they never say what happens after .
that cinderella drove the prince mad by obsessively cleaning the castle .
they don't say what happens after because there is no after .
the be all and end all of romantic love was ...
mike?
sex?
you have sex on the brain .
marriage .
but it wasn't always like that .
the 12th century had " courtly love " , which had nothing to do with sex .
the relationship between a knight and a married lady of the court ...
and so they could never consummate their love .
they rose above " going to the toilet in front of each other " love ,
and went after something more divine .
they took sex out of the equation , leaving them with a union of souls .
think of this .
sex was always the fatal love potion .
look at the literature of the time .
all consummation could lead to was madness , despair or death .
true love has spiritual dimensions , while romantic love is a lie .
a myth .
a soulless manipulation .
and speaking of manipulation ...
it's like going to the movies and seeing the lovers kiss ...
the music swells , and we buy it , right?
so when my date kisses me , and i don't hear strings , i dump him .
the question is , why do we buy it?
because , myth or manipulation , we all want to fall in love .
that experience makes us feel completely alive .
our everyday reality is shattered , and we are flung into the heavens .
it may only last a moment , an hour , but that doesn't diminish its value .
we're left with memories we treasure for the rest of our lives .
i read , " when we fall in love , we hear puccini in our heads .
i love that .
his music expresses our need for passion and romantic love .
we listen to la boheme or turandot , or read wuthering heights ,
or watch casablanca , and a little of that love lives in us too .
why do people want to fall in love
when it can have such a short run and be so painful?
propagation of the species?
we need to connect with somebody .
are we culturally preconditioned?
good , but too intellectual for me .
i think it's because , as some of you may already know ...
while it does last , it feels fucking great .
i'm almost finished , and you haven't started yet .
the perfect bite .
you need a therapist .
do we have to have the tv on?
can't we have a conversation?
i'm not intellectually stimulating , like your university people ...
i'm sorry .
how was your day , mother?
who gives a shit?
i said i was sorry .
let's talk .
i've lived too long .
i should be dead .
give me that !
talk to me already !
all right .
you haven't even noticed i had my hair done differently .
i thought you looked different .
it looks great .
what's different about it?
the ...
nothing .
you're just like your father .
so easy to trip up .
so , how was work?
same as always .
though i had one customer in for a make over .
she needed one .
dyed blonde hair .
blue eyeshadow .
ash brown foundation .
hideous .
she was shocked over my age .
how old were you?
sorry .
i ran into mr. jenkins again .
he cornered me in the elevator .
he invited me to an alzheimer's benefit .
i said forget it .
i can't believe he still asks you .
why don't you go with him sometime?
no ...
i raised two daughters .
i buried a husband .
that's my life .
i don't want to start another .
and he knows my situation with you .
you won't see him because of me?
how would it look?
the mother's dating and the daughter stays home?
who's looking?
hello ...
hi .
hello , this is ...
hello , i'm gregory larkin .
professor gregory larkin .
answer the phone .
i'm sleeping .
is professor larkin there?
i mean , is professor morgan there?
barely .
who's this?
gregory larkin .
i'm a professor in the math department at columbia .
i was just calling to see ...
how are you tonight?
i'm fine .
how are you?
fine .
i hope it wasn't presumptuous of me , but i went to your class
and was very impressed .
i hoped we could eat dinner saturday .
louder !
i sat in on your class .
hold on .
don't go away .
i was impressed by your teaching .
i was hoping we could have dinner saturday .
i can do this !
can you hear me?
okay ...
you want to eat dinner .
i sat in on your class .
who's on the phone?
quiet !
no , not you .
gregory larkin .
math department .
columbia .
i saw you pass by .
i was just passing by ...
i'm sorry about calling ...
i was so confused .
are we on for saturday night?
sure .
i'm looking forward to it .
moi aussi .
he must be good looking , for you to go to all this trouble .
i hate lipstick .
did you try the samples i brought?
i'm not going .
oh , what do you want for dinner?
i don't care .
i'm upset .
can't you see that?
you always cancel your dates .
this is not a date .
then why does it matter how you look with this one?
stop calling him " this one " .
and nothing's going to happen .
you need more colour .
let me do it .
don't make me look like a clown .
you won't look like a clown .
where's the hairpiece?
shall i make you something to eat?
make him wait .
he mustn't think he's the only date you've had in years .
where's the bow?
hey , your mother did you up again .
looks great !
can i get you a cab?
sorry .
are you sure?
you're going to take me?
here's where i'm going , but don't go until i put up the window .
they're broke , lady .
my hair !
don't complain to me .
complain to the cab company .
i'm sorry .
for what?
you're exactly on time .
my hair .
i must look like i was attacked by wolves .
i didn't even notice .
could you excuse me while i go to the ladies 'room for a minute?
do you enjoy dancing?
i used to love to dance with my father .
you?
i find it embarrassing .
i enjoy watching it .
watching?
pairs ...
it's interesting how coupling appears in nature and mathematics .
you were talking about pairs ...
oh , the twin prime conjecture .
it explores pairs of prime numbers .
those only divisible by themselves .
three five .
five seven .
not seven nine ...
nine can be divided by three .
that's right .
11 13 and 17 19 and so on .
it was discovered that pairs were often separated by ...
one number in between .
exactly .
did you read my book?
no , i'm sorry .
that's okay .
this is marvellous .
a first date like a game show .
i didn't mean to lecture .
i'm sorry , i didn't mean to call it a date .
it's just rare that i meet a person i can discuss these things with .
some pepper?
no , not for me .
could you bring me a side dish of extra dressing?
i don't particularly like salad , i just like the dressing .
interesting theory .
are there still pairs like that past a million?
i can't believe you thought of that .
that is what is to be proven .
i have concert tickets next saturday .
can we do this again?
sure .
great .
terrific .
what was it you wanted to discuss about my teaching?
i have to confess .
that was just an excuse to meet you .
i hope you don't mind .
i found it interesting .
how do you get them to stay?
well?
nothing .
what happened to your hair?
don't ask .
you won't be seeing him again?
we're going out next week .
so , he must like you .
did he kiss you?
no .
that's kind of sweet , actually .
hi .
this is cindy .
this is a spectrum analyzer .
it makes graphic representations of the music .
watch .
who's the girl?
rose morgan .
henry fine is a professor in anthropology .
beautiful music , isn't it?
beautiful atmosphere .
i enjoyed that .
thank you so much for inviting me .
why don't you come up?
i'd like to give you a copy of my book .
i'd love that .
your book , i mean .
not to come up to your apartment .
but rose , i'm inviting you .
if you like this kind of music , i have some wonderful cd's , but ... ... they're also in my apartment .
i have to be honest with you .
i'm a bit out of practice with this .
i want you to feel comfortable .
that's important to me .
i want to tell you upfront .
i'm not interested in sex .
you're not?
and it has nothing to do with you .
it has to do with what you were talking about in your class .
i , too , believe it's illusions about love and the emphasis on sex
that separate people today .
as you said , romance is a myth .
i was referring to academic opinions that are purely subjective .
you were right !
relationships based on romantic love are worthless .
did you stay for my whole class?
i left when you mentioned the music we hear when lovers kiss in films .
it is manipulative !
in real life , we don't hear music when we kiss .
and the person you're with isn't a movie star .
it's a malicious ...
fantasy?
is it all right if i sit down for a minute?
the addiction to beauty and perfection created by advertising
feeds on people's pathetic hopes .
they don't have their own opinions .
the media tells us what's beautiful .
tv shows tell us what a relationship is supposed to be like .
and sex !
i don't even want to tell you how that's ruined my life ...
well , i go crazy .
when i want someone sexually , i go out of my mind .
do you remember that film where the woman kills the bunny?
" fatal attraction "?
granted , it was a film .
but i understand how she felt .
not that i would kill an animal ,
but i know the feeling of wanting someone so much that it hurts .
this fiction , known as love , drives people crazy , as you said .
then you're either mad , alone ...
or dead .
but that was fiction .
right !
we're dead !
i do believe two people can come together , even marry ,
for reasons more concrete than sex .
a love that grows out of respect , love , trust , common interest .
have you noticed that friendships last longer than marriages?
the 12th century was on to something .
would you like coffee?
got any scotch?
yeah .
are you busy this week?
i was hoping you could help me with my teaching .
you give yourself too little credit .
maybe you could sit in on one of my classes .
if x squared plus y squared equals 16 ,
how do we find d yld x as an implicit function of x and y?
well , y is a function of x ...
you walk across the room like this , and you're into your own thing .
your body language is very detached , very alienating .
i think you have to relate more to the kids .
you're up there with your back to the room , solving your own problems .
it's like you're having a math party , and only invited yourself .
relax .
loosen up .
have some fun .
relax .
have fun ...
what else?
loosen up .
put the pen down , i'm not going to test you on this .
come on .
teach me something .
if a ball is thrown up into the air , and its height , h , equals 100 t ...
what are you doing?
turn around .
talk to me .
if t is time in seconds , at what limit is the speed ...
you lost me .
you have to put it in context .
jazz it up , put some humour in it .
humour in calculus?
well , try telling a story .
a story?
once upon a time ... ... there was a ball .
it was thrown into the air .
and its height ...
maybe i should just write books .
no one understands those , either .
just kidding .
don't give up .
try it again .
tell you another story?
hi , professor larkin ...
sorry .
that's all right .
do we have an appointment?
actually , i wanted to make one .
could you come back tomorrow?
after class?
my head is swimming .
it's hot .
put your head between your legs .
pretty girl .
with all that make up?
you don't wear any , do you?
i'd still look like me , only in colour .
you're too smart for that .
you're a confident , no nonsense woman .
i sound like an airline .
i'm probably saying it wrong .
it's just that you don't need any of that .
thanks .
how's your head?
i think food will help you .
pizza , maybe?
where can we go?
dancing?
why did i say that?
there's that great dessert place .
all delicious things are fattening .
my mother would kill me .
what is that , danish?
this is the one .
trees are fascinating .
they don't have to touch to propagate .
you would find that fascinating ...
how many do i need?
one , two , three , four ...
why didn't i see that?
thank you .
i owe you one .
it's right in front of your eyes .
six and a five .
i got you .
the pretzel !
you can have mine .
you sounded excited on the phone .
i'm going to take my theory of love as a man made cultural creation
and expand it to include the biological effect on the individual .
you need a hobby .
i can't believe you've dated for three months and haven't kissed !
i can't believe you've dated for three months and haven't kissed !
how do you say hello?
well , we nod .
it works .
you mean you haven't even touched?
i fell once , and he picked me up .
we talk a lot .
that's what we do .
and i don't worry about what i say , what i wear , what i eat ...
it's a relief to eat with a man , and not worry that he'll be frightened .
he's fun to be with .
maybe " fun " isn't the word .
he's interesting .
how many men can you say that about?
is a tie too personal a gift?
are you using it on something other than his neck?
does he look good in vests?
why do you want him to meet your mother?
i kept saying i was a great cook , so i offered him a birthday dinner .
now i need something nice .
after meeting her , i won't see him again .
i'm starving .
can we eat?
i can't , i have a date .
find a gift for dr. strangelove .
who?
we should get you some blush .
i'm hungry , claire .
fruit .
why are you so grumpy?
if he wasn't gorgeous , rich and straight , i wouldn't have bothered .
i'm sick to death of the man i am bound to for eternity .
why are you saying that?
no matter where i go , what i do , there he is .
in the kitchen , on the phone , on my finger .
i was asleep the other night .
when i wake up , he's staring at me .
i think that's sweet .
i think it's strange .
do you know how weird that makes me feel?
a lesbian dream , and he's staring at me like i should include him .
i can't even fantasize in private .
mom said you've been seeing someone steady .
is he cute?
what?
what are you doing here?
i thought i'd meet you for coffee .
is that a terrible thing to do?
excuse me .
i'm going to the ladies 'room .
alone .
can you believe this weather?
it's almost april and it's still cold .
i'm glad i have you alone .
can i ask you a question?
lt'll sound strange , but ...
is claire happy?
i mean , do you think she's happy?
yes , i think she is .
why?
i'm being silly .
i'm a first time husband .
if she doesn't wake up and tell me she's ecstatic , i worry .
imagine , i have you to thank for the fact that we're married .
you made this possible .
knowing you has changed my life .
don't do that .
what?
what am i doing?
you don't even know , do you?
rose ...
just tell claire i had to run .
rose , i'm sorry .
i really thought i was over him .
i hate this .
it's so stupid .
i must sound so pathetic .
he asked if claire was happy , and i lied .
isn't that awful?
nothing criminal .
thanks for coming so quickly .
are you feeling better now?
a little .
you know , rose , it takes time .
yeah , i know .
i want you to know our friendship really means a lot to me .
i feel the same way , which is why tonight ...
i better go home , i have to get dinner ready .
i'll see you at eight .
shall i bring anything for your mother?
yeah , a wooden stake and a crucifix .
rose loves to fold napkins .
it's one of her idiosyncracies .
i came home late and threw this on .
god knows how i look .
i hope you like it .
my god , rose , it's art !
it's not art .
an artist isn't only one who paints .
it's one who sets the table ,
prepares a meal , or teaches in a certain way .
you're an artist .
why didn't you use the limoges?
may i serve you?
rose !
my hands are clean .
we go to all this trouble , and rose and i don't eat very much .
i've always thought she had a very healthy appetite .
i can't stand women who eat two bites and say they're full .
do you really need extra salt?
you know how it retains water .
can i have some?
and potatoes .
you don't need them .
have you ever sat in on one of your daughter's lectures?
rose !
that's the best part .
rose tells me you've never been married .
that's all right , rose .
that's true , mrs. morgan .
i guess i haven't found the right girl .
i've had relationships that haven't worked out , but that will change .
really?
why?
as i told rose , i have a theory about love ...
and sex .
does anybody want coffee?
what theory?
regular or decaf?
regular .
i can make cappuccinos .
would you like cappuccinos?
greg , why don't you help me .
why don't you put the coffee on?
i made dinner .
you put it on .
i've raised two daughters , buried a husband , i've made my coffee .
alone at last .
i've heard a lot about you .
and i've heard a lot about you .
you've been seeing a lot of my daughter .
i hope you don't mind my asking ...
what are your intentions?
my intentions?
what a lovely meal !
you're a good cook .
i didn't oversell myself?
not at all , but the trouble ...
of course i had to go to the trouble .
it was your birthday .
what are friends for , but to give each other presents and stuff ...
happy birthday .
open it up !
i really hope you like it .
dice?
they once were dice .
now they're cuff links with ...
prime numbers !
they're great !
how'd you do that?
i had them made just for you .
they were done very fast .
thank you .
well ...
i've wanted to ask you something , and i can only say this once ...
sit down .
we have a lot in common .
some variables will remain unknown ,
as is the case with most complex equations ...
greg , talk to me .
i'm not saying this right .
this feeling you have for alex ...
it won't be the same with me .
you won't have that ache in your stomach , because we're not in love .
i think we share a genuine affection for each other .
we share a passion for knowledge rather than a physical passion .
although , if sex is something that interests you ,
i'm sure i could provide that on occasion , given enough warning .
what are you saying?
we were in love and miserable .
it's a waste , because as people , we're valuable .
when i look at you , i see a woman unlike any other i've known before .
your mind , your humour , your passion for ideas .
i'm very fond of you .
when i'm with you , i feel as if ... ... as if i'm home .
so i think we should get married .
people marry for sex or beauty .
are my reasons more insane than those?
are you in shock , or just appalled?
blink if you can hear me .
why are you laughing?
i'm sorry .
this sounds silly , but i was just thinking ...
how could i marry someone that i've never even ...
you know ...
... kissed .
there's one thing i have to say .
i promised your sister i wouldn't .
you love claire , too?
you just slept with her?
you want to?
i don't even know her .
it's about how i found you .
i wrote this ad ...
i think that's kind of great .
i thought you'd be upset .
why?
you picked me .
actually , i found you through this charming woman on tv ...
well , well , well ...
so?
gregory just proposed to me .
do you need a valium?
i know you don't respect my opinion , but i don't trust him .
i mean , where's the attraction?
he's not attracted to me .
he doesn't want sex .
he wants to be companions .
what sane person would agree to that kind of marriage?
it's not natural .
are claire and alex natural?
he wants me , mother !
he wants you to cook and clean !
he found you through an ad .
i already know , mom .
sorry .
it's not your average proposal , but let's face it ,
they're not standing in line for me .
and we like each other !
then say yes !
i can live alone .
if you think such a marriage is normal , then go ahead .
why do you do that?
why do you make it sound so pathetic?
you had a life .
a husband who adored you .
can't i have some of that?
i'm getting older , too .
why can't you be happy for me?
but you can't , can you?
you're scared to death of being alone .
and you're jealous .
jealous because a man wants me .
a good looking man .
how ridiculous !
well , you know something , mom?
a man does .
today , gregory larkin and rose morgan have exchanged rings
and agreed to recognise each other as equals .
they shall seek a life of kindness and understanding .
the ceremony of marriage is a means of establishing a home .
and as you have exchanged vows before witnesses ,
by the authority vested in me , i pronounce you husband and wife .
congratulations !
she's a great ...
yes .
i've heard so much about you .
likewise , about you .
we all ought to ...
had i known you were this handsome , i'd have answered the ad myself .
congratulations .
she's the best .
if i were a man , i'd be all over her .
congratulations .
i'm sure you'll both be very fascinating to watch .
rose , isn't it amazing how many books you accumulate over the years?
i know what you mean .
i can't believe it .
and the dust !
this place needs a good cleaning .
we'll take care of that .
i made room for your books .
need any help?
everything's put in its place .
what would you like to do?
go to bed .
to sleep ...
in order to sleep .
you go to the bed for sleeping .
do you want to do something else?
what?
i wasn't going to say anything .
do you want the bathroom first?
no , i can wait .
no , you go .
please .
your turn .
tired?
not really .
me neither .
these are nice .
you want to watch some tv?
sure .
i have some old movies .
it happened one night " , " lawrence of arabia " , " now , voyager "?
how about " lawrence of arabia "?
it's nice and long .
okay .
lawrence of arabia " it is .
