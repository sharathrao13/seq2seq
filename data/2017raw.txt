just ... a few questions .
okay , let's talk here .
with these people .
all right .
okay .
my bike's across the street .
ask your questions before we get to it .
is it a scam?
scam?
dypraxa .
does it cure t. b?
yes , it cures .
but it can also kill , you know , because they haven't got the formula right .
right .
so why don't they work on that?
it's cheaper to fix the trials .
exclude the patients that have side effects , you know .
to go back to the lab would cost them time ... two years ... millions of dollars , and other companies would have time to produce their own cures .
okay , next question .
you said to tessa in your e mails that the kenyan government had approved the trials .
somebody bribed them .
who?
threebees , lorbeer .
we don't know .
but $50, 000 in the right hands , and you can test battery acid as skin lotion .
my bike's there .
stop !
stop !

<i>[ chattering in german ] </ i>

i want to know why pellegrin suppressed tessa's report .
it was him , wasn't it?

kdh is swiss canadian .

curtiss is one of us .
he's british .
christ , justin , stop bleeding for bloody africa and show some loyalty .
that plant kdh built in wales could have gone to france .
fifteen hundred jobs in a depressed region .
we owed them .
they needed help with the dypraxa trials .
kdh needed an investment partner here .
<i>curtiss and threebees</ i> <i>served us both . </ i>

pressure on kenny ... to stop the tests , redesign the bloody drug .

it was a bizarre sort of suicide .

so who has got away with murder?
not , of course , the british government .
<i>they merely covered up, </ i> <i>as one does , the offensive corpses . </ i>
