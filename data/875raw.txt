we're ...
farmers .
let's go .
hold it .
there it is !
get over here .
now stop it !
hello !
ls they dead?
they'd better be , cos i'm gonna bury 'em !
let's go .
my brother .
my brother .
he's dead .
his shoulder and leg is pretty badly broken .
you a doctor?
horse doctor .
but bones is bones .
also a blacksmith .
bring brother .
more in the centre .
god , we pass on to you the body and soul of this nameless peckerhead .
at least he went quick , and he ain't going to suffer scurvy , the dysentery , spotted fever or the cholera not to mention other maladies contracted in consort with low women .
or waste years digging in the dirt and finding dirt , like i have .
talk about him !
you wanna be next?
and seeing how he survived all that , he could have been hit by timber , fall down a shaft , starved , get murdered or committed suicide on christmas eve .
what i mean , god , is you have no pity for your living children , so that's why we're asking you to be a little kinder to them when they're dead .
so , with all due reverence , lord , we pass on to you this corncracker's body and soul to take him and to keep him ...
i stake this claim for me and my new pardner , whatever his name is ...
forever and ever .
amen .
pull him up .
got a dream , boy got a song

but who gives a damn?
who gives a damn?
we're on our way
i still see elisa
she keeps on returning
as breathless and young as ever
i still hear elisa
and still feel a yearning
to hold her against me again
her heart was made of holidays
her smile was made of dawn
her laughter was an april song
that echoes on and on
since i saw elisa
the shadows are falling
and winter is calling above
but i still see elisa
whenever i dream
of love
elisa .
that the name of your girl?
yeah .
i found this .
i thought it might make a good crutch now that you seem to be getting around good .
thanks .
it just don't seem right , mr rumson .
you doing all the work and me getting half .
i mean , it's your mule , your tools and all .
it was your brother .
well ...
where i come from , we're cautious of strangers who talk in an easy manner .
you got me down for some kind of low scuff from new orleans?
sell you patent medicine with one hand , pinch your purse with the other?
that's what i was thinking .
actually , you're right , but i ain't yet sunk to horse stealing .
i've salted claims , yeah .
and i've sold whisky to lnjuns .
once a man come at me with a gun , and i killed him .
i can't think of one commandment i ain't shattered .
i never did fancy my parents , let alone respect or honour them , and i have coveted my neighbour's wife ...
whenever i had a neighbour and whenever he had a wife .
and i gamble and i cheat at cards , but there is one thing i do not do .
i ain't never gulled a pardner .
the one sacred thing , even to low scuff like me , is a man's pardner .
two pennyweight short of four ounces .
pass me your pouch , i'll pour your share .
and , pardner , i'll swap pouches with you anytime you say .
i meant no offence , and i appreciate you saving my life and all .
but what's expected in return?
that's right .
i like to know what crops i'm planting .
when i get dead drunk , fall in a muddy street ,
i expect you to come get me , cos i don't want to die muddy drunk .
lf i owe a man $100 , stand good for me , and if i get melancholy , which can happen ,
i expect you to be my companion and solace me .
what happens when you get in a fight?
lf four of anything come at me at one time , you might lend a fist .
up until that , i can take care of myself .
you see , i don't fight fair .
well , i don't fight at all unless i absolutely have to .
i got kind of a temper , and once i start , i just can't quit .
well , good .
just remember that i'm on your side .
i hear a shopkeeper's pulled into town with a wagon full of whisky .
what do you say i hoist you up that mule and we go get boiled?
i ain't a boozing man , either .
well , i am .
town meeting tonight !
there's gonna be a town meeting tonight !
town meeting tonight , ben .
ben !
ben rumson !
mooney !
this is my pardner .
i thought you went back to lreland .
i am .
i'm just passing through .
it's right on the way .
mooney .
how's it going , willie?
i ain't won a hand in three weeks .
this is my pardner .
he calls himself rotten luck willie , but that's just to get the suckers .
you can't beat him , so don't play .
i don't gamble .
neither does he .
my name's ben rumson .
this here's my pardner .
and i'm buying whisky for any man that can stand up .
i was sitting there .
now you're standing there .
whisky !
ben rumson , you have an outstanding account in the amount of $68 from yuba city , and which you skipped town on me .
skipped town on you?
i was run out .
don't you remember?
i want to be paid now before they run you out of this town .
put that damn gun down and stand these boys the whisky .
dry your hands before you weigh it .
we need supplies .
a pound of sugar , half a case of whisky , and pneumonia for schermerhorn there .
a pound of sugar and a two pound sack of flour , please .
evening .
horace tabor , worcester , massachusetts .
when did you get in?
arrived this morning .
hit a vein this afternoon , and i aim to be back in worcester by christmas .
it says here california's going to be admitted to the union .
just what it needs ... law and order .
that's good news .
well , it ain't to me .
it's my policy to bust out of any territory the day it become a state
and head for the wilderness .
i don't agree , sir .
you look around the human race , you wonder what was god thinking .
god made the mountains god made the sky
god made the people god knows why
he fixed up the planet as best as he could
then in come the people and gum it up good
the first thing ya know
they civilise the foothills and everywhere he put hills
the mountains and valleys below
they come along and take 'em and civilise and make 'em
a place where no civilised person would go
the first thing you know the first thing you know
they civilise what's pretty by puttin 'up a city
where nothin 'that's pretty can grow
they muddy up the winter
and civilise it into a place too uncivilised even for snow
the first thing ya know
they civilise left they civilise right
till nothin 'is left till nothin 'is right
they civilise freedom till no one is free
no one except by coincidence , me
the first thing ya know
the boozer's in prison and the criminal , he isn't
and only the rascals have dough
when i see a parson i gotta put my arse in
the wagon that follows the tail of a crow
the first thing ya know i pick up and blow
the first thing you know
ben rumson !
you bloody old rumpot !
mad jack duncan !
this is my pardner .
i heard you was in town .
wait till i tell you what happened to harry and ernest and me .

anybody seen ben rumson?
he left here about 20 minutes ago .
thanks .
are you his pardner?
he owes me $80 .
he said you would stand good .
pardner .
can you help me get up on the mule?
you all right?
i get melancholy every now and then .
it's a disease common to mountain men who live alone a lot , but if you stay with me such times , i'll be ok .
all right .
did ezra atwell come to you for that $80?
yeah .
i stood good for you .
i guess this is what you meant , when you said you expected me to come get you muddy drunk in the street .
and now you're gonna be my companion in my moment of despair .
well , you're my pardner , ain't you?
i like you , pardner .
i like you , ben .
my mother and father's dead , and my two brothers and myself , we worked the farm .
then last year , my older brother , he took himself a wife .
me and my kid brother decided to leave michigan and come out here , maybe dig some gold , get enough money to buy some land .
except now that he's gone , i don't have too much appetite for farming .
what about your girl?
girl?
yeah .
elisa .
ls she gonna come out and join you , or did she marry your brother?
to tell you the truth , there is no elisa .
i just read that name somewhere and made it up .
them's the best kind , but what i need now is the worst kind .
it's a living hell up here , what with the bloody rain and the bloody loneliness , and that bloody , bloody wind .
maria , maria
they call the wind maria
away out here they got a name for rain and wind and fire
the rain is tess the fire's joe
and they call the wind maria
maria blows the stars around and sends the clouds a flyin '
maria makes the mountains sound
like folks were up there dyin '
maria , maria
they call the wind maria
before i knew maria's name and heard her wail and whinin '
i had a girl and she had me and the sun was always shinin '
but then one day i left my girl i left her far behind me
and now i'm lost so goldurn lost
not even god can find me
maria , maria
they call the wind maria
out here they got a name for rain for wind and fire only
but when you're lost and all alone there ain't no word but lonely
and i'm a lost and lonely man without a star to guide me
maria , blow my love to me
i need my girl beside me
maria , maria
they call the wind maria
maria , maria
blow my love
to me

there's 64 women coming into town !
men , 80 women coming down the river !
lady , i got $50 here in gold dust .
you can have it all if you let me hold the baby .
very well .
no , i don't want your money for it .
you'll hurt his feelings , sarah .
take it .
look at them eyes , glowing like he just hit pay dirt .
he's a girl , you bummer !
would anyone else care to hold the baby?
not now , jacob .
just where are you people from?
lilinois , originally .
i'm jacob woodling .
this is my wife sarah .
and who is this fine young lady?
her name is elizabeth woodling .
your sister?
no .
my wife .
your wife?
i thought that one was your wife .
they both are .
holy moses !
they're mormons !
du lieber himmel !
nice work , old man !
can we get something to eat there?
with $50 , you can , sir .
follow me .
what the hell is a mormons?
lch wei nicht .
bridegroom , i don't give a damn how a man prays .
there's room in hell for all of us , but it just ain't equitable , for you to be having two of something all of us got none of .
so i'll tell you what i'm gonna do .
your mule's lame , and i got a beauty that cost me $140 .
i'll swap you straight , my mule for one of your wives .
now , which one's baby's mother?
god knows i wouldn't want to separate mother and child .
i am .
good .
i fancied t'other one , i did .
this is immoral .
i hope so !
the woman's married .
no , she's not !
we don't recognise plural marriage in california .
then i bid $250 in gold for her .
260 !
265 !
wait !
you can't buy a woman for money .
try and get one without it .
all right , what about it , mormons?
jacob , we need every penny , and i can't bear another day of those martyred looks .
there it is again .
this ain't a martyred look , sarah .
this look is pure hatred .
quiet !
brigham young has 27 wives , and he hasn't had half the trouble with them .
then simplify your life , jacob .
sell me .
but , elizabeth , you don't know what you'll get .
i know what i've had .
go ahead , jacob .
gentlemen ...
out here i ain't a mormon .
elizabeth is a headstrong woman , especially since her own baby died two weeks ago , but she's given her consent to be sold .
therefore , if any of you want to bid for her , so be it .
but let's go outside , where there's room for more people .
but these religious dogs are bloody greedy !
come on !
come on !
you wait here and feed the baby .
it's not proper you standing on a block .
lf anyone wants to inspect you i'll send them in .
order !
order !
i intend to conduct this auction in an orderly manner !
and no bids in spanish .
the last bid was $265 and two blankets . $265 , two blankets and a jackass !
a two pound sack of coffee , a two pound sack of brown sugar ...
holbrook , even if she is bought , how will she marry who bought her?
she'll be married by the prevailing law of this community , which is mining law , and she will be treated like any other legal claim !
order !
order !
order !
order !
the man bids $275 , four blankets , one pickaxe and a bedpan .
mooney , there's a woman in the saloon with a baby pressed against her breast .
that's right .
wait .
it ain't every day that we got a woman in atwell's
pressing her breast with her baby .
that's right .
clendennon , there's a woman in atwell's pressing her breast to the saloon .
i know , and we're bidding for her .
sam fletcher bids $300 , four blankets ...
ben , where you going?
there's a breast in atwell's pressing a woman against her .
you better stay here .
look !
there's another one !
he's a mormon .
he has two wives .
i'll kill him .
they're bidding on her now .
what's the bid?
whatever the bid is , i double it !
$400 was bid last !
mr ben rumson gallantly doubles that bid to $800 !
800 once ...
wait !
i'm his pardner , and he withdraws the bid .
you have power of attorney?
power of what?
written permission , signed and witnessed .
lf he could do that , he'd talk for himself .
800 twice !
wake up , ben .
come on .
sold to mr ben rumson for $800 !
he only looks that way when he's drunk .
you ain't exactly seein 'him at his best , but once i get him washed down and clipped ,
i think you'll be agreeably surprised .
get the soap and water
get the soap and water
got a sweet perfumer to try his humour
it's ben's weddin 'day
wash him down and clip him
wash him down and clip him
he's got a blue eyed wonder to put him under
it's his weddin ', ben's weddin 'ben's weddin 'day
where am i goin '?
i don't know
where am i headin '?
i ain't certain
all i know is i am on my way
amen
dearly beloved , we have gathered together to grant this man , ben rumson , exclusive title to this woman , mrs elizabeth woodling , and to all her mineral resources .
i have drawn up this record of claim , which here and henceforth will be recognised as a certificate of marriage .
so i ask you , ben , do you recognise this claim as a contract of marriage , and do you take this woman to love , honour and cherish?
he does .
elizabeth woodling , do you take this man , ben rumson , to love , honour , and obey him until death do you part?
she does .
i now pronounce you claimed and filed as mr and mrs ben rumson .
mr rumson went to town ridin 'on a pony
bought a wife and brought her home and called it matrimony
mr rumson bought a bride out in californy
he'd have saved a lot of money stayin 'drunk and horny
oh , susannah he's happy as can be
for he's got him somethin 'better than a banjo on his knee
rumson , he got married today married today , married today
rumson , he got married today what'll he do tomorrow?
ben !
i'll be glad to help you work your claim !
i'll be bedding down by the fire if you need me .
you'll not regret taking me in , i'll make you a good wife .
you sure as hell will .
i don't fault you for taking me for an easy woman .
i was bought and paid for .
but you bought me for a wife , not a whore .
lf you come again at me again like a slavering dog , i'll shoot you !
watch where you point that thing .
you'd blow my manhood halfway to the moon .
i mean to make you a good wife and honour this contract of marriage , but only if you will honour it as well .
i don't know what you mean by honour it .
i know your sort of man .
my father was the same sort , born under a wandering star .
i ain't fool enough to bond you with all the tyrannies of marriage .
all i want is your name , mr rumson , and the least measure of respect due to a man's wife .
but most of all ,
i want you to build me a cabin .
a cabin that'll stand up in winter with a fireplace of stone and a door i can bolt if i have to .
and if you do that , i will say you have honoured the contract .
but if you regret having bought me , say so now .
and if i have to work forever , i'll see you get your $800 back .
i admire your pioneer spirit and your straightforward manner .
ls that what you've been admiring?
i've been admiring you .
all right , i'll build you a cabin , and i'll give you my name proudly .
you're mrs ben rumson , and i'll kill any man that says you ain't , and i'll stick to it till i move on , which is when the gold pinches out or the first snow of winter .
you ain't gonna claim duress later just cos i held a gun on you?
no , ma'am , i ain't going to claim duress .
i seem to lack all sense of shame with you .
these men came all the way from fiddler's camp just to see your wife .
hiya , ben !
looks like i married myself a tourist attraction .
some of these boys hiked 15 miles .
ben , how's married life?
pardner , it was so good , i forgot that i was married .
i'd hike 15 miles to look at that myself .
i can see it ain't gonna be easy , married to the only woman in these mountains .
all right , boys !
the lady wants a cabin to live in , a proper cabin made out of wood that'll hold up in the winter !
so just don't sit there gaping , get to work !
send back the world there's too much night for me
the sky is much too high to shelter me when darkness falls
four cabin walls would be just right for me
i need a threshold i can cross
where i can sit and gather moss forevermore
a million miles away
behind the door
roll up the plains there's too much view for me
there's so much space between the waiting heart
and whispered word it's never heard
one room will do for me
where every evening i can stare at someone
smiling from his chair across the floor
a million miles away
behind the door
where every evening i can stare at someone
smiling from his chair across the floor
a million miles away
behind the door
no fears , no fools
no lies , no rules
just doing with my life
what life is for
a million miles away
behind the door
elizabeth .
elizabeth?
where have you been?
down at the rapids taking a bath .
you mean you was taking a bath?
i mean i was taking a bath .
what do you think i mean?
you was down at the rapids just now , bare beam and buck naked?
i'm not like to take a bath with my clothes on , mr rumson .
are you trying to tell me you was taking a bath?
that's right .
i was taking a bath .
ln the middle of the night?
mr rumson , in a community of 400 men , would you rather i took my bath bare beam and buck naked in the middle of the day?
what's the matter with you?
what's the matter with me?
i ain't running around in the middle of the night in my drawers .
hey , boys !
listen to this .
the proprietors of the hares and hounds club in sonora
wish to announce that six ladies are expected to arrive by stage
from san francisco on the 15th of august .
how about that .
that's a hundred miles away .
what good is that gonna do us?
ain't no one trying to steal your wife , ben .
i'll admit there's a few who wouldn't mind trying .
horace tabor , for instance .
he likes to give her a look .
horace tabor?
come on , ben .
he just looks .
she doesn't encourage him or anybody else .
but you're beginning to cut a comical figure .
everybody's laughing at you .
i would've never thought of tabor .
what the hell are you looking at , horace tabor?
i'm looking for my stirring stick .
you make any more advances towards my wife , and i'm gonna shoot you down like the dog you are !
and the rest of you horny gorillas !
you want something to do?
put up your money for them six french tarts coming into sonora !
but keep your lusting minds off of my wife !
i'd advise you , rumson , not to refer to me as a dog again .
ls that clear?
i'll stick my fist in your ear !
why you ... !
grab tabor !
stop him !
get back !
get ahold of him !
mr rumson !
rumson , i ...
mr rumson !
nobody has behaved unseemly to me .
i have been treated with nothing but kindness in this camp , and you owe every one of these men , especially mr tabor , an apology .
by god , you're right !
i don't know what's come over me .
i've been behaving like a damn fool , and i wish to beg your communal pardons , especially yours ,
horace tabor .
i suppose if i was married to the only woman in the neighbourhood , i might be just as demented .
and , mrs rumson !
may i extend my compliments?
you are as wise as you are fair .
get your hands off !
that lunatic tried to kill me !
i demand a town meeting to consider a proper course of action .
lf that knife had come one inch lower , i would not be here today .
that's right .
fellow citizens , as long as that madman prowls among us , no one is safe .
therefore , we must find a solution by tonight .
let us not wait until the condition worsens or his aim improves !
thank you .
order !
mr chairman !
the chair recognises ezra atwell .
i would like to ask ben rumson directly if he doesn't think that with a little sober effort he could control these fits of jealousy?
no .
it's getting worse every day .
sorry , i can't help you .
the chair recognises ben's pardner .
thank you , mr holbrook .
i've been giving it some considerable thought , ever since ben rumson , my pardner here , poor bastard ...
excuse me , ma'am ...
well , ever since he became a lunatic .
what's putting the strain on ben's mind is having the only woman for 90 miles around here .
my proposal is that we get some more women for this town .
how you gonna get women to come up here?
order !
order !
i know where we can get some women .
the six french bawds arriving in sonora a week saturday .
you're right .
let's get them to come up here instead .
how? lf i was a french bawd , i'd go to sonora .
lf you was a french bawd , we'd have no trouble .
how will we get 'em up here?
they gotta take the stage from sacramento , and change horses at starbottle's pass .
so five of us go down there , hijack that stage , re route them tarts up here instead .
what's so hard about that?
it all sounds just fine to me .
when do we go? !
order !
order !
ls it your proposal , mr rumson , that we knock out the stage driver , steal a coach and kidnap six women?
sounds better every time i hear it .
you don't see what's wrong with it?
what?
lf you don't consider assault and battery , grand larceny and kidnapping wrong , what the hell do you consider wrong?
you maniac !
sit down !
you insane man !
schermerhorn , you're out of order .
what?
i yield the floor .
proceed , schermerhorn .
what?
speak !
you maniac !
you insane man !
what do you think them people in sonora will do when we hijack their fruleins?
they grab their guns and come up here to get them back !
order , order !
gentlemen !
mr atwell has the floor .
gentlemen , it is 50 miles from here to starbottle's without a road or a trail .
not even my mule can do it , how ...
you lunatics !
besides a civil war with sonora , you want to put us in the white slave business !
schermerhorn , you're out of order !
again?
you haven't been recognised !
i'm schermerhorn .
mr holbrook .
oh , sit down !
ben , these boys are right .
mr holbrook , i withdraw the proposal .
have you gone out of your skull?
you can't expect them to build a two storey building
just to get women here .
who said two storeys?
somebody has to run the faro tables .
rotten luck willie will .
you can't expect him to build a fancy building with chandeliers and masterpieces of art and gambling , and six beautiful tarts upstairs .
we'd have every bummer for miles around coming here to spend his money on women and whisky at atwell's and schermerhorn's .
you think that's bad?
why , it's terrible !
just terrible !
you'd turn this camp into a boom town !
we don't want to do that .
soon there'd be another saloon .
and a bawdy house !
and another gambling hall !
and another bawdy house !
and hotels !
property would shoot straight up .
they'd make more money selling old claims than gold .
these men didn't come out here to forge a nation !
that's for men with a big dream , with visions of america's greatness .
i'm warning you , if you want to turn us into a dreary boom town metropolis filled with nothing but millionaires , all you gotta do is put up one little , tiny two storey cathouse !
i say let's put it to a vote , and any man opposed is a traitor !
all those in favour of bringing prostitution to this camp , say aye !
passed !
there's a shifty side to you that i'm just beginning to appreciate .
why can't i go along with you?
who'll take care of elizabeth?
it'll take three days to get them tarts back here .
you don't expect me to leave her alone in the middle of this?
who can i trust if it ain't you?
you didn't say being pardners meant wife guarding .
well , it just come up .
howdy .
captain barnsfeather , fort sumter .
when does the sonora stage come?
about four o'clock tomorrow .
why?
supplies for the troops .
unmount !
come in , pardner .
you sure i'm not intruding?
come in .
will ben really get back in three days?
why?
i'd like to know .
who you expecting for dinner?
you !
sit down .
thanks .
i didn't know you was expecting me .
i talk to the trees
but they don't listen to me
i talk to the stars
but they never hear me
the breeze hasn't time
to stop and hear what i say
i talk to them all
ln vain
but suddenly my words
reach someone else's ear
touch someone else's heartstrings too
i tell you my dreams
and while you're listening to me
i suddenly see them come true
i can see us on an april night
looking out across a rollin 'farm
having supper in the candlelight
walkin 'later arm in arm
then i'll tell you how i passed the day
thinking mainly how the night would be
then i'll try to find the words to say
all the things you mean to me
i tell you my dreams
and while you're listening to me
i suddenly see them
come true
they're coming out of starbottle's !
all right !
fall together !
put me down , you bloody idiot !
put me down !
down , down , down , down !
get in line !
come on , move !
captain barnsfeather , fort sumter .
at your service , ladies .
here to protect you along the way !
we're gonna have to take this detour .
a detour through open country?
the road up ahead ain't safe .
lnjuns !
ain't no lnjuns around here !
get back in the coach , ladies .
there's a coach comin 'in !
comin 'in !
there's a coach comin 'in lf you listen , you can hear it
a clip cloppin 'over the hill
and the sound that you hear ls as good to your ear
as the call of the wild whippoorwill
there's a coach comin 'in you can feel it gettin 'near
all at once and it bursts into view
and it looks to your eye like it fell from the sky
like a coach full of dreams come true
for it's bringin 'me eyes that are moonlight
and it's carryin 'lips that are wine
