it's just a tiny iittle bump , officer .
i checked it out .

make it a mai tai .
that's what we drank in korea .
who are you people?

that's why we kept him here , boss , for you to decide .
what did you hit him with?

it might ... help .
has anyone else a gun?

finaily got a hit , shit head .
come on , miiler , knock him in !

.... quarre .
quarre .
it's an alias .
i reaily had a photograph , not of that psychopath .
but ....
shh , there's a game on .
thank you , dear .
don't gloat .
i'm not gloating , don't be a sore ioser .
maybe he's onto us for seattle .
you shouldn't have iet him see you .
i wasn'tjust going to iet him walk out of here .
the questions are : what are we going to do with him?
what if there are more of him?
kiii him .
we do not kiii him .
because the penalties for kiiling are so distasteful .
yeah , that's easy for you to say .
he didn't have your picture .
he has no picture , hoop .
perhaps we should outfit you with a wooden club and a ioincloth .
are you ....
are you cailing me backward?
the best way to chase something , hoop , is to iet it chase you .
greetings , erin .
business .
that's what you always say .
this is a business .
teii the old people the schedule's been moved up a day .
a day?
that's today .
that's why you'ii want to hurry .
sorry .
you should try to have a calming influence on hoop ..
.. rather than a inflammatory one .
is it your place to teii me who not to inflame?
as a matter of fact it is .
with this rose , i thee wed .
aii things in good time .
untii then , ..
.. iover and loved .
pimp and whore .
coarseness does not become you .
that sick fuck .
it'ii aii be over soon .
aii of it?
this job , our iast .
you and him?
that over?
what do you mean?
you know what i mean .
he hurts you .
keeps us down .
i got to pack .
i'ii help .
if tyrone sees you in my bedroom ....
we're just talking , for christ's sake .
okay .
later then .
hoop .
i never chose tyrone .
yeah , but sometimes you iaugh at me with him .
he expects it of me .
don't you understand that?
fucking cop's iistening .
hoop .
the cop's not our problem .
tyrone .
so we ieave the airstrip no iater than 8 pm .
don't smoke that in here .
i sure as heii won't miss you teiling me what to do .
controi freak .
controi is a good thing , thomas .
you could do with more of it .
controi that .
then we iand in bermuda no iater than 2 am .
correct?
aye aye , sir .
we refuel .. .. and hoop's piloting the balance of the journey to the caymans .
is he taking his meds?
yes , i assume so , why?
he asked me to teach him to fly , .. .. but i'm not responsible if he flies off the handle .
i wiii controi hoop .
how'd you know where to find us?
i didn't .
you're not who i'm iooking for .
i have a pict
yeah , right .
a picture with a guy with blond hair , blue eyes .
i'm iooking for a girl .
oh , now it's a girl .
gee , you know i just can't keep your stories straight .
hoop !
stop it !
alright .
settle down .
these are too tight .
eventuaily i'm going to be alone with you , cop .
get away from him .
is that better?
thanks .
there is a picture .
and there is a girl .
was it out of wiilfulness or out of stupidity you iet him see you?
i'm sorry , tyrone .
but i think he seems to have seen you too .
no he hasn't .
it seems he's smarter than you .
she's iike a spoiled child .
hatefui towards those who take care of her .. .. and yet totaily dependent .
leave her alone .
and hoop is the spoiled boy .
the spoiled boy , .. .. to whom i gave a future despite the metai plate in his head .. .. and the diagnosed psychosis .
now , hoop , .. .. was it the beile of tacos or the king of burgers .. .. which had most recently rejected your services?
what are you iaughing at , cop? !
maybe it's good that our stay in these close quarters nears its end .
brunch is ready .
no , brunch is canceled .
the unexpected appearance by the officer has altered our plans .
excuse me .
i have been cooking since his god damned appearance .
no one said anything .
weil , perhaps brunch is just what we need .
who would iike to say the blessing?
how about our guest?
he should say a prayer .
leave him alone .
you have nothing to worry about .
i'm sure everything wiii go as planned .
i'ii say the blessing .
thank you , lord , for that which we are about to receive ....
ten miilion doilars , amen !
you always forget the ketchup .
bring me a beer .
please .
no , thank you .
he's probably not used to eating a proper breakfast .
this is delicious .
remember you're flying , thomas .
i flew 57 missions in korea .. .. and i was drunk every damn time .
don't you tei  let him drink .
i'ii fly the damn plane .
i'ii iet you co pilot , shut the fuck up while i'm teiling my story .
excuse me , dear , .. .. but nobody gives a titty about your story .
i don't want this punk interrupting me .
come on , old man !
you want to fly?
i'ii iet you fly .
come on .
come on .
first one's free .
are you children? !
must i put you in separate rooms?
take him into the kitchen .
you brought the cops .
shut up !
you defective iittle prick .
it's our banker friend .
delay him .
keep him out of the house .
your clothing is inappropriate .
go change it .
david .
what are you doing here?
i needed to see erin .
she ieft me a message , it's important .
she's not available just now .
where is she?
frankly i don't know .
i just came in from shopping .
i'm sure she'ii get in touch with you iater .
why don't you go back to your office?
if mr. quarre knew you were playing hooky .. .. he might not iook so kindly on you dating his granddaughter .
david !
erin !
hey !
it's happening today .
what?
yeah , now .
why?
weil , i don't know why .
but tyrone says it has to be .
look , i can't .
if you want us to be together , you have to .
go back to the bank and we'ii see you soon , okay?
david , i'm in the street in my robe .
look , i adore you .
thomas !
isabeile !
if we're delayed , simply wait at the ianding field .
keep your ceii phone on in case of a problem .
erin !

he expects me .
i wiii deai with david .
hoop !
yeah .

water?
you iook a iittle stressed .
look , miss ....
erin , please .
erin .
you need to iet me go before that head case hoop comes back to kiii me .
tyrone won't iet hoop kiii you .
tyrone is against kiiling .
so ...
do you want any kind of music?
you iike some music?
look , miss , please ....
i can't iet you escape , .. .. because then i would have to escape and no one escapes tyrone .
that's ridiculous .
is it?
this is how tyrone says you shouldn't have ieft .
it's alright , i get ten percent off my pedicures now .
are you taking your medication?
why?
you appear agitated .
yeah , weii you piss me off .
they got a medication to make you stop doing that?
what do you plan on doing with your share of the money?
i want ... to breed dogs ..
.. back in utah .
exceilent !
is there a young iady in the picture?
maybe there is , maybe there isn't .
d
david brewster .
we're here .
hoop is beginning .
why are we doing this today?
what?
what did you say?
i need an explanation .
your explanation wiii be your share of the money .
is erin there?
no she's not .
but i have complete faith .. .. you wiii be able to swindle your bank without her .
just make sure you're available for me when i enter .
you don't iook so good .
that's because you're used to iooking at you .
maybe that drink wasn't such a good idea .
what should i do?
what should you do?
find that picture so you can see i was teiling the truth .. .. and you can teii your friends .
i'ii iook a iot better when i'm not waiting for someone to kiii me .
alright .
listen , i couldn't find the picture .
okay , i walked the whole block .
hey !
oh , god .
please , don't die .

how you doing , ieatherhead?
i got the generator set up in case this storm messes with the iights .
how's it iook?
oh , it iooks great .
i've been thinking about some of those missions ....
has the plane been fueled?
yes .
and i'ii be here just as iong as you need me .
excuse me , sir .
i put your kit in the fridge .
you could have iet me die .
cop dead from a diabetic coma .
it's perfect .
dump the body somewhere .
nobody would ever know i'd been kidnapped .
i guess i owe you one .
i mean that .
i noticed your suitcases were packed .
were you supposed to be somewhere else today?
not on turk street .
like where?
the berkshires .
fantasy camp for frustrated musicians .
basketbaii junkies go to michaei jordan's basketbaii clinic .
i get my fix playing with yo yo ma .
your apartment struck me as ionely .
don't cops dream?
nightmares mostly .
i don't trust you ieaving here without seeing erin .
then by aii means you should caii her for reassurance .
i trust she's at home .
women talk .
some excessively .
yes?
we got problems .
the system is patched into a backup power source .. .. that's more complicated than i thought .
can you deactivate it?
yeah , yeah , yeah .
i'm working on it .
it's just going to take some time .
how much?
i don't know .
two , three minutes tops .
do it !
did i hear what i just heard?
i was a state sponsored prodigy untii moscow coilapsed .
my peers became prostitutes , musicaily or otherwise .
i met a man in a bar .
tyrone became your ticket out .
he said he saw my potential .
i flattered myself he meant my music .
so you guys are robbing a bank , right?
how?
just smile .. .. as you teii me about the federai reserve .
you reaily don't know who we are?
i'm just a cop who finds stolen cars .. .. who's iooking for a iost girl .
and iook , you found one .
you are not iost .
it would take a search party to find me .
what are you doing?
stand .
ladies and gentlemen , please calm down .
i'm sure the problem wiii be fixed momentarily .
send the money .
send the money !
send the money !
sir , i'm sorry , i'm sure the problem is just momentary .
i don't have moments .
teii your officer to wire my ioan immediately .
we wire funds electronicaily .
our computers are down ....
weil , to heii with your computers !
my funds must be sent by 6 o'clock .
i'm afraid that if wiring the funds is an impossibility ....
have you heard of this device?
can it not be used with your approvai to transfer funds?
sir , please , please just calm yourself .
if you'ii just step into my office .
would you mind?
do you know " chanson triste " by du parc?
do you iike being tied up in a chair?
or would you rather play some beautifui music?
how much are we talking about?
ten miilion .
our spread is substantial .
it went to committee .
now , think iender iiability , sirs .
if those funds aren't in escrow by day's end .. .. my company wiii iose a one hundred miilion doilar contract .
so consider that to be your true exposure .
my iaptop is charged .
i could modem it through .
i'm cailing my iawyer .
sir , that won't be necessary .
get the iaptop .
i missed a few notes .
that's a nice piece .
i never played it before .
i know what i want for saving your iife .
what's that?
they say playing the ceilo is iike dancing .
show me .
how?
you'd have to put the gun down .
it's crazy .
i believe in the concept of a man and a woman .
and the man owing her one .
i mean , you did say that , didn't you?
that you owe me one .
don't do this .
damn you .
put your hand on mine .
a.
d.
g.
i could break your neck .
i should .
yeah , you should .
are we done?
yeah , we're done .
we're even .
mr. abernathy , this disk contains aii the routing information , .. .. account numbers and passwords .
it's your authentication .
great , just a iittle more paperwork .
now , ..
.. about erin .
he insists on meeting erin at his place .
we don't have time for this .
do we know where the banker iives?
yeah , it's over the mountain .
it's a haul .
you've been there?
i drove her a couple of times .
i thought they used to meet in restaurants .
weil , maybe he cooks .
go there .
tyrone cailed .
he said it could be another couple of hours .
i sent wiily for dinner .
tyrone?
and you trust him?
this job is no different from seattle .. .. or sydney or dailas or miami .
and he stiii needs us .
unless he thinks he can take a bus to the caymans .
but this is our iast one .
then he wouldn't have cailed .
do you think we'ii be happy in fiji?
we can have sex on the beach .
oh thomas !
let's go wait in the airplane .
you know i won't have sex on airplanes .
but this one's on the ground .
when was he ieaving the bank?
he should have been here 45 minutes ago .
she gabs on the phone , even as the outcome remains unsettled .
not even you would be that dim witted .
maybe the two of them are working together .
get out of the car .
what?
get out of the car .
why?
watch for him .
hey , it's raining out here !
then go inside .
get in !
but there was a accident .
i don't want to hear about it .
get in !
you see that?
what?
this !
this !
this !
this !
just how would he find you?
not by iooking .
he knows where i'd go .
he can hear me think .
what would he do when he found you?
maybe he'd kiii me .
maybe you could prevent that from happening .
maybe ...
maybe he and hoop are coming back to kiii you .
you worked your way partiaily free from the bonds .
you'd have no choice but to kiii them in self defense .
so give me the gun .
we could wind up with ten miilion doilars .
you know what happens to cops who have ten miilion doilars .
they eat their service revolvers .
they can't ....
open your mind , jack .
you're more than a cop .
i'm more than a thief .
you'd know that if you're paying attention .
i have been .
and i know .
erin?
where is she?
erin !
hey , banker boy !
what are you doing in my house?
you should thank him .
look what a splendid effort he made infiltrating your bank today .
where's the disk?
ahh gee , it's iocked !
there's no fucking disk !
where is it?
hey , what's this , huh?
go ahead , .. .. it's password protected .
okay !
okay !
okay !
but i just risked everything for erin .
you think i'm going to blab now just to get out of a beating?
weil ... tick tock .
what time is it?
they haven't cailed .
must've ieft you behind .
or should i say they ieft your ass?
they wouldn't .
no , and a fine ass it is .
you can keep sitting on it untii my cop friends start iooking for me .
or you can cut me ioose , come in with me and teii what happened .
damn !
what?
what?
bastard !
i'm to blame now?
go ahead , but that stiii doesn't change the facts .
they didn't need you and ieft your ass .
shush !
god !
heilo?
why has the phone been occupied?
i'm sorry , i didn't even know it was off the hook .
why didn't you check it?
how could i know it was off the hook?
your friend here insists on seeing you .. .. before he gives us our information .
you must have fucked your way into his heart .
hoop's on his way for me .
i have to get ready .
so this is your first crime?
yeah .
no embezzlement , no juggling ....
no .
nothing .
not even as a kid?
no shoplifting , no peeping tom?
hardly .
so this reaily is your inauguration .
take my advice ...
you know , i stole my dad's car once .
reaily?
yeah .
drove it to mexico .
what happened?
drove it off a cliff .
never even told my father .
apparently , driving isn't one of your talents .
come on in here !
come on !
jack , please .
come on !
keep coming .
come on , pick up the phone !
what are you doing?
pick it up !
pick this up !
i can make it iook iike he died escaping .

tyrone .

just me .
just you .
how fetching you iook , my dear .
perfect for a iate date .
david !
erin !
i tried to be there but he ieft without me .
quick , what's the password?
we need some time together .
weil , there's no time .
weil , certainly a short interlude can be squeezed in for young iovers .
give me the gun .
give them fifteen minutes , no more .
i did it !
i did it !
i knew you could .
come here , come here .
not giving tyrone the password was so smart .
god , who knows what he would have done if i wasn't here .
so what is it?
oh no , no , no .
i'm going to the caymans with you .
you cannot be seen with tyrone .
not now , not ever .
i'm only going to be gone for a few days .
then we can go away together iike we planned .
i don't think i can wait any ionger .
oh , you poor thing .
as soon as we get the money .
i promise .
enough promises .
oh , shit .
i was dreaming , ..
.. we were on this beach .
i iooked wonderfui in my bikini .
yes?
what the heii are you puiling?
our young friend became difficult .
difficult?
you haven't seen difficult , i have .
you try a battalion of gooks squirting napalm up your butt .
that is difficult !
.... and you've been aptly rewarded .
now you iisten to me , ass face !
the bank could stiii figure this thing out .
hoop !

password accepted .
it might be the quarres .
continue north , hoop .
what about the plane?
we don't need a plane .
we'ii be driving to our destination .
i see no reason to share this .. .. with that boorish man and that insipid woman .
our shares wiii increase accordingly .
is somebody planning on teiling me where we're going?
we're driving to albany , .. .. new york , where i've cultivated some banking relationships .
then what?
then a mere three hour drive to the canadian border .
i need to use the bathroom .
you should have done that back at the house .
i didn't know that back at the house !
we have a six hour drive to albany .
and if we're not out of the country by 2 pm , .. .. you'ii have no pot to piss in .
we need to get gas anyway .
fiii it up quickly and check the tires .
erin , do me a favor .
wipe off the dead banker .
tyrone .
the cop had this .
he wasn't iooking for hoop .. .. for beating up some clerk in seattle , he was iooking for you .
maybe i shouldn't have told you .
teii him .
i arranged for you to get the gun .
he wants you to kiii the cop .
yeah .
but it's not what we want .
yeah .
okay .
what?
tire .
.... in the middle of nowhere .
why have you stopped here?
i'm going to check the spare in the trunk .
what do you mean the spare?
didn't i teii you to check it back at the gas station?
any iast words , brainiac?
i'ii spare you my wisdom , you'ii forsake it anyway .
oh no please , i'm sure i'ii miss it .
i'ii iook at your iife as a novel , ..
.. this being the tragic moment .. .. at which , in the ultimate irony , .. .. our headstrong hero shoots himself in the brain .
so iet me get this straight : you're my brain?
not only that , i'm also the restraint that you iack .
stand back .
without me , you would be in prison or worse .
you reaily think you would thrive so without me?
witness tonight .
because i wasn't standing right beside you .. .. you kiiled a man .
and once you shoot me , you'ii have kiiled two men today .
and the cop , three .
do you imagine that erin wiii ride into the sunset with you?
shut that music off !
turn it down !
okay !
okay !
hoop !
what are you doing?
nothing .
our friend only got a iittle overexcited .
it's better now , isn't it?
yeah .
get in the car .
not you .
were you behind this?
you told me to give him the gun .
so the policeman reaily is after me?
yes .
we'ii see .
an unfortunate detour , i'm afraid .
i need the gun .
no .
use another method .
i've seen that you can .
go .
hoop , wait !
weil , now my dear , .. .. witnessing an execution you caused is only going to be awkward .
what could you possibly say to the man?
cop !
i told you i'd be back .
i hope you know how to die fast .. .. because we need to be in albany by eight .
you know how to die fast?
die fast , cop .
fast .
faster !
faster !
faster !
faster !
faster !
faster !
faster , cop !
spare yourself the effort .
we iack time , so forgive my brevity .
were you carrying a photograph when you stumbled upon our house?
yeah .
now iook at me .
was the picture of me?
was this the picture?
that wasn't the picture , that wasn't the fucking picture !
leave him alone !
the truth is it hardly matters .
a kiiling has already occurred .
not just this one but another man as weil .
so the stakes have been raised .
it does make sense to clean up ioose ends .
and i'm a ioose end .
the ioosest .
erin ...
come here .
now , just put your finger there .
easy , this is your baptism .
you think 'cause you've already kiiled somebody , kiiling me is no big deal?
you kiii me and every cop on the planet takes a sudden vacation .
you become the case that never closes , the guy they never stop huntin '.
you be job one .
pay attention , erin , 'cause this applies to you , too .
when they catch you , wherever they catch you .. .. they're going to subdue you .
and they're going to subdue you substantiaily .
then they're going to teii you to run .. .. and that's going to confuse you , 'cause you never heard that before .
then your animai brain's going to kick in with the survivai mode .
hey , they're ietting me go " .
so you'ii run .
and then what?
then they shoot you , dumb ass .
weil , don't you think they have to catch me first?
oh , you're thinking aii that money is going to help you hide?
that's funny , 'cause those shit for brains over there told me about your .. .. time frame .
now , if you planned on driving to albany in six hours , .. .. that means you're going to use the new jersey turnpike .
and you're probably going to drive at night .
but now you're iate .. .. and you hadn't counted on rush hour .
so if you think you're stiii going to make that drive in six hours .. .. you got another thing coming .
dearest , i don't remember hearing anything about albany .
i knew it !
you dirty double crossing bastard !
put it down .
nobody's trying to cross you , thomas .
give him the disk .
now .
oh , god !
what have i done?
oh , god !
this is a weil oiled machine !
look , why don't you take me with you?
what?
you can't get the money on your own , but you can with my help .
my car's got flashing iights and a siren , .. .. i can stiii get you to albany in time .
you get as much of the money as you can , .. .. i drive you to the border , you go across .
hey , you promise me a share , maybe i'ii cross with you .
and then what?
i need some more insulin .
.. when we get across we iet the giri decide who she wants to go with .
you propose driving through a busy city with a captive policeman .
you must think me a foolhardy man .
take a turn at the next corner .
left .
now ieft again .
i thought we were going to the freeway .
turn again .
left .
go there .
out of the car , both of you .
further .
here .
so how do you move ten miilion doilars?
send the money to a number of banks .
in amounts smaii enough not to draw attention .
hey .
why don't you try and get some sleep .
oh , man !
it's worse than i thought .
hey , hang on , it's going to be bumpy .
nicely done !
oh , man .
hey .
are you going to shoot me in the back while i'm driving?
mr. leeds , please .
yes .
can you hold please?
yes , i'ii hold .
so tyrone , who's going in to grab the money .

don't be absurd .
i trust you no more than i trust her .
yes , mr. clifford leeds , please .
this is mr. leeds .
welcome back , mr. abernathy .
it's been so iong since we've seen you .
one more thing , i'm a bit iil .

no , ..
.. but this much .
hey , how are you holding up?
fine .
you are going to give her her share before we cross the border , right?
once we cross , .. .. you can either go with me , go with him .. .. or go your own way .
good morning .

we have time to make it to another bank .
it's not worth the risk .
now , then , iet's go to the border .
we cool?
we're cool .
you're going to have to iose the shotgun .
it's essentiai to our understanding .
i'ii just cover it .
give me the map , erin .

perhaps you'd iike to stay in my employ ...

don't move , jack !
i'm alright .
tyrone !
give yourself up !
