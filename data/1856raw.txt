el alameln the line of fire
okay , get off .
nice here .
sure is .
what are you doing?
you never know , might find something .
if i'm lucky , this backwash will be enough to get back .
how much longer?
are you in a hurry?
we're almost there .
egypt october 1942
this is it .
you're here .
report over there .
okay , thanks .
is that good water from el daba?
yes , a two liter canteen .
don't let them steal it .
pvt. serra , reporting .
i just got here .
i've been posted here .
lt. fiore .
are you alone?
what do you mean , sir?
i asked for substitutes , i expected at least 10 men .
are you alone?
yes , sir .
are you an urban vigilante?
i'm a university volunteer .
i know what it stands for .
it was a joke .
what do you study?
literature and philosophy , third year .
why didn't you finish?
i heard soldiers were needed on the front , i'd be a coward not to go .
they said they'd send us to africa , so i signed up .
where are you from?
palermo .
what's being said in italy?
we'll arrive in alexandria and drive the british out of egypt .
how's the weather there?
fall has begun , but we're still swimming in palermo .
is that good water?
yes .
let me have a sip .
come on .
good .
sorry , water's an issue here .
you'll join s. sgt. rizzo's unit .
corporal .
take our student to rizzo .
take off that patch .
it's useless here .
yes , sir .
why did he tell me to remove it?
some people have been in africa for two years now .
they've earned repatriation , but can't get back home .
when they see someone who could have stayed home ... but decided to volunteer ... they get ticked off .
what was that?
british 88's .
they always shoot four at a time ... but the ones that hit you sound different .
it's the first thing you need to know .
if you want to get out alive , perk up your ears .
give me some of your water .
excuse me ...
i haven't had real water in so long .
get down , this'll hit us !
corporal !
who are you?
what happened?
pvt. serra .
i have to join sergeant rizzo's unit .
they shot at me and the corporal , but i can't find him anymore .
i'm rizzo .
de vita and spagna .
who was the corporal?
part of the command company .
boys , take a look around .
i found this .
he became sand .
it happens .
we'll report it .
you used up your first miracle .
just got here and already used up a miracle .
what miracle?
that's enough .
let's go .
is that good water?
yes .
stay low .
set yourself up there , a guy from padua used to be here ... he got hit by a grenade splinter .
it literally pierced his stomach .
is he dead?
the war is over for him .
he's in a hospital in bengasi .
they will send him home soon .
come , i'll brief you .
to the right , the qattara depression .
not much to worry about .
there's a minefield past the barbed wire , then no man's land .
the british are over there , you can't see them .
but they see us clearly and send their 88's here .
keep low during the day , we move at night .
our artillery?
the remaining cannons are in the north .
we're in the south sector , abandoned by god .
keep your head low .
if you get dysentery don't report sick , we all have it .
just cope with it .
vipers and scorpions .
watch where you put your hands and when you put on your shoes ... because scorpions look for warm places at night .
a quarter liter of water a day .
if you're used to washing up , learn how to do it with sand .
rations arrive after dusk , but often don't show up .
you'll have to make do with canned goods and biscuits .
cigarettes in abundance , but matches are scarce .
got that?
yes .
any questions?
the mail?
on and off .
beloved mom , dear father ...
i've finally arrived on the front line .
my unit is posted in the southernmost point of the front ... near the qattara depression .
i'm the youngest .
the others are veterans of africa .
everything is empty , immense .
i've yet to see real war .
it's not what i expected .
clashes , battles , gunfights .
our real enemies now are thirst and dysentery .
we must be careful ... because we can die suddenly , unexpectedly ... without ever seeing the enemy .
i hope i'll distinguish myself and make you proud of me .
spagna , where the fuck are you?
everything okay?
yes , lieutenant .
if that had hit our pit , goodbye homeland .
lieutenant .
how's it going?
fine .
well , they keep getting closer .
lieutenant , two wounded in the connection zone .
hit by 88's?
no , by a sniper .
what?
let's go .
what happened?
the two linemen were adjusting the telephone cables ... and they were shot by a sniper .
how did he get there?
we don't know .
he must have arrived last night .
he wasn't there yesterday .
stretcher bearers !
where is he?
perhaps behind those wrecks .
lieutenant , sir .
do you feel like going?
yes .
be careful .
he may disregard your armbands .
we'll go anyway .
run !
hide !
he got him .
did you see where he's shooting from?
i saw a spark from behind that truck .
are you sure?
yes .
i saw him clearly .
we need the mortar .
who'll go call tarozzi?
me .
go to the command post , get him , and bring him here .
he needs to bring his 81 , hurry .
stay low and always run for cover !
where's tarozzi?
over there .
who's tarozzi?
me .
lt. fiore needs you , hurry .
you called for me?
set up the mortar .
ready .
come here .
see that wreck?
yes .
there's a sniper in there , blow it to pieces .
yes , sir .
cover !
you son of a bitch !
go to hell !
don't shoot !
damn you !
to hell !
don't waste ammunition !
bastards !
listen ... shall we blow up this son of a bitch?
yes , sir .
see what he did to our boys?
yes , sir .
then concentrate and send him straight to hell .
got it?
i'll get him , i swear .
cover !
get the wounded man and take him to the infirmary .
fix the cables .
good job , tarozzi .
let's go .
you're a champ .
what a sight .
they remind me of my town's fireworks .
the rations arrived today .
tasty sand and rice mush .
know why rations arrive at night?
so we can't see all the flies in the food .
when do you think we'll attack?
when will we get to alexandria , to cairo?
maybe you don't get it .
we've been here four months and haven't advanced a meter .
cairo , the pyramids , we can forget about them .
you've become an expert on military strategies?
it's common sense .
our provisions are in libya , bengasi and derna .
that's 1, 000 kilometers from here .
we're far from everything that's why nothing arrives on the front line .
but the british bases are nearby .
they switch off every 15 days .
they take leave and go have fun .
rommel isn't just any guy ... he whipped the british pretty badly .
if he made it this far , why can't he advance some more?
if he stopped , something must have happened .
supplies and ammunition haven't arrived .
gas hasn't arrived and neither has water .
i think the british will attack soon .
even if they do , they won't get through here .
they won't kick us out .
firm , solid , immovable ... neither forward ... nor backward .
sergeant , what do you think?
that you talk too much .
once you start thinking , you're dead .
just do as you're told .
and if i have to die ...
i'll die .
that i won't surrender .
they won't take me ... not alive .
what is it?
a british truck .
it drove over a mine .
let's go .
where?
to do some shopping .
there are mines here .
stay in line behind me .
i don't want to have to scrape you off the ground .
sergeant .
what?
i stepped on something .
don't move .
stay still .
you lucked out .
move .
slowly .
it's an anti tank mine .
they're calibrated for 300 kilos .
if it was an anti personnel mine , you'd be gone .
christ , be careful .
you used up your second miracle .
damn .
what do we have here?
look .
these british have it all .
chocolate , whiskey , jam ...
everything , even canned fruit .
sergeant , he's alive !
what'll we do?
the british will come get him , they'll handle it .
let's hurry up .
come on , let's go .
serra , move it .
good stuff .
want some?
british vitamins .
all this talk about miracles ... what is it?
look at this .
it was on my head .
a bullet entered here and exited here .
i could have died .
but i didn't ...
i felt ... a breeze through my hair .
what would you call that?
when you step on a mine that doesn't explode ... grenade splinters hit the pit ... and the guy next to you dies ... these are miracles .
the corporal turned to sand , you didn't even get a scratch .
that was your first miracle .
here , we are each allotted three miracles .
you've only got one left .
afterwards all you can do is pray .
and you , how many do you have left?
we used them up long ago .
don't worry ... if you're going to die , it shows the day before .
how can you tell?
your nose becomes thin and long ... and your ears , transparent like tissue paper .
you're pulling my leg , right?
good morning , lieutenant .
what have you got there?
where are we?
naqb rala , south sector , why?
i knew i'd get lost .
damn !
these trails are all alike , nothing but fucking sand .
these aren't supply trucks?
no , special transport .
i'm supposed to go to el daba ... but i had to change route because of a bombardment .
el daba is on the northern coast , at least 80 kilometers away .
it's full of shoe polish .
what?
for the parade , when we reach alexandria .
what's in this truck?
a horse .
mussolini's , for the parade .
we could roast it with potatoes .
you can't touch it , i have to bring it back .
then say the british took it as a prisoner .
do something , you tell them .
you keep this .
i'm confiscating the horse .
pull it out .
you can't , it's mussolini's horse .
if anything happens , they'll shoot me .
bullshit .
tell them i took it , they can come to me .
open up .
it really is mussolini's personal horse ...
i swear .
you don't get it .
tell mussolini we've been eating sand and drinking piss for months .
if he wants to march in alexandria with his horse and shiny boots ... he's got to send us arms , uniforms ... water , shoes , food , medicine , and fresh troops to replace us .
he has to send the air force to bomb the british .
forget about shoe shines .
got it?
who's going to kill it?
who's going to kill it?
sorry , you're a beauty but we're in bad shape .
take it , get lost .
beloved mom , dear father , today we're moving .
the lieutenant is sending us behind the front to get bins of water .
after weeks of being stuck in the pits ... riding in the desert tastes like freedom .
we seem to smell the sea .
it's 60 kilometers away ... but for us , it's more unreachable than a mirage .
camel plains , dove hills ...
gazelle cliff .
but they are mere dots on the map that only the bedouins can recognize .
are we lost?
no .
know where we are?
more or less .
it's all the same here ... even the names ...
qaret el khadim , qattaret el diyura ...
qaret el yidma .
all the same .
they said there were palm trees , but i don't see any .
we should be near , try that way .
there they are .
no one's here .
are you from the pavia division?
yes , that's us .
i thought you got lost .
it's all yours .
tastes like diesel !
tanks we stole from the germans .
we have to drink diesel tainted water?
you should thank god i brought them .
how long since you've gotten a water supply?
seems you're not doing well .
we can't drink this water , we're not animals !
enough , let's unload it .
all wasted water .
know how many i've transported through this desert?
thousands of tanks , and what for?
to rinse the generals 'underwear .
then they complain we don't move forward or backward .
bullshit !
i've got a solution .
what?
if i transported grappa ... we'd be at the pyramids by now .
in wwl , we italians along the piave river ... were all drunk , otherwise , like hell would we have won .
i feel generous today .
drink , men are supposed to drink wine .
use the water for the truck radiators .
spagna , how long since you've had a bath?
do i smell?
sure , we all stink !
i asked because ... about 40 kilometers from here ... is the sea .
how would you feel about a swim?
are you crazy?
we'll dive in and leave .
then they'll court martial us all .
let's vote .
shall we go or not?
let's go .
shall we go?
yes !
sure , fuck it !
why don't we stay here?
we'll hide away and wait here for the end of the war .
hey , what are you doing?
who are you?
pavia division , we're on a mission .
that's a mined area .
get out of there !
sergeant , is what they say true?
what do they say?
that the british took you as prisoner and you managed to flee .
they caught me when bengasi fell .
they brought us to a pow camp in egypt .
some were glad ... because they figured the war was over for them .
being a prisoner is horrible for a soldier .
it's humiliating ... it's a non life .
a soldier's duty is to fight , a prisoner's is to flee .
i didn't want to rot away in kenya or india .
i managed to go back to bengasi .
the british were still there .
for three months i hid out at a friend's place ... in a brothel .
it was the best time of my life .
then when we liberated bengasi ...
i went back to my troop .
how long have you been in africa?
two years .
you never went back to italy?
no .
this is a cursed place .
you boil in the day , and freeze at night .
but what a sky .
i'd never seen a sky like this .
the desert plays with you ... makes you think strange things .
i'm sure of one thing .
when we go home ... if we save our hides ... we'll miss this wretched place .
the minefields , the sand , the pits ...
everything .
we'll miss hunger and thirst .
it's cooked .
a brush of oil and rosemary .
lieutenant , want some?
fire up two steaks !
what is this stuff?
camel steaks .
where did they come from?
serra did it .
wait .
what does that mean?
weren't you on lookout today?
yes , sir .
tell me exactly where you found the camel .
right in front of me .
at the lookout point?
yes , near there .
christ .
show me .
here?
there , see the blood?
how was it killed?
i shot it .
isn't this supposed to be a mined area?
i believe so .
how did the camel get here without blowing up?
i don't know .
the camel didn't come here by chance .
the british sent it into the minefield .
if it doesn't blow up , that means it's safe .
we have to check the area .
what's the situation?
it's all de mined here .
there's a clear path of at least five meters here .
can you close the gap?
we'll try .
any news from command?
we've been cut off , we know nothing .
they say the british are preparing an attack .
it's a matter of days .
they're waiting for the full moon .
this time , it'll be a major attack .
we keep finding de mined areas along the front .
which sector will they attack?
they say to be on guard .
they saw heavy movement of vehicles and troops .
our command is moving the ariete tanks toward the north .
but that'll leave our rear uncovered .
if they attack with tanks , how will we stop them?
that's what i heard .
call us if you need us .
thanks .
you called for me , sir?
rizzo , sit down .
this arrived .
we're on general alert .
after that de mined area ... they asked me to send a unit to check the depression .
the depression?
they want to be sure the enemy won't attack through the depression .
that's impossible .
the depression is impassable , even for bedouins .
it says here to send some men to verify .
you must find out what happened to the bersaglieri unit ... which was posted on look out .
they haven't reported back in days .
got it?
good .
get one of your men and leave right away .
all right .
lf we encounter the enemy?
leave immediately .
units are only useful if they return .
yes , lieutenant .
good luck .
know why i chose you?
because you're the youngest , you're a volunteer ... and the last to arrive .
we're below sea level here , right?
according to the map we're at 70 below .
it's an oven , it must be at least 50 degrees celsius .
don't think about it .
the more you think about it , the hotter it feels .
how far have we gone?
about 12 kilometers .
sergeant , what is it?
it's a mirage .
they call it morgan le fay .
what shitty shoes .
i got blisters all over .
what is it?
i wonder who drew these .
once , this area was all green .
there was water , trees , animals ...
when the ancient romans were here?
long before that ... at least 10, 000 years ago .
10, 000?
i can't even imagine a number like that .
studying teaches you lots of things .
i finished elementary school , i can read and write ... but that's it .
at age 10 , i was in the hills with the cows .
know what i miss most?
the green fields behind my house .
there's a plum tree .
i sit under it ... and look up .
know how to ski?
no .
back home , the first snow has already fallen .
see anyone?
no , no one .
nothing .
what if the british are there?
they'll shoot at us .
if the british made it here , they can make it anywhere .
they're more bedouin than the bedouins .
what will we do now?
we'll go back .
is today the 23rd?
what?
is it october 23rd?
yes .
why?
it's my wife's birthday .
how old is she?
30 .
i haven't seen her in two years .
i wonder if she'd recognize me .
that's the north .
those are our posts .
these aren't the usual 88's .
let's go .
de vita .
what are you doing?
fixing the case .
it's all broken .
how are you?
fine .
what happened to you?
nothing , why?
your hair turned white .
really?
where's spagna?
spagna ...
spagna , how are you?
it came down like hail .
what happened to de vita?
a grenade landed three meters from him , made a huge hole , but he's fine .
not a scratch , just his hair .
how many boys did we lose?
at least 20 , between dead and injured .
what we expected has happened , the battle has begun .
the british attacked the entire front .
they bombed us , but they didn't attack with tanks and infantry .
they tried to break through the folgore sector .
they suffered great losses there ... entire companies destroyed ... but they held their position .
they stopped the tanks with incendiary bottles .
an attack is expected tonight , with the full moon .
our 28th is with ruspoli's group at point 105 .
they want us to go there .
a gap has opened , they want us to patch it .
are they sending us to croak , sir?
who are you?
pavia division .
i'm lt. fiore .
lt. sforza of folgore , we were waiting for you .
how's your situation here?
last night was a nightmare .
the british bashed us .
the 19th is gone , the 22nd has few remaining defense posts ... and the 6th is surrounded .
we don't know how long they'll hold up .
we stopped them by burning about 30 british tanks .
they told us to reinforce ruspoli's group at point 105 .
ruspoli's gone , he died this afternoon .
an 88 hit his truck , three officers died .
one from the pavia division .
what should we do?
take post at point 115 , between the 24th and 20th .
one of my soldiers will bring you there .
are there tanks?
they promised us the ariete tanks and the german panzers ... but we can only count on our forces now .
you three with the breda , in here .
tarozzi , there with the mortar .
three more in there .
serra , de vita , in here .
find some sacks and rebuild the wall .
you two , in here .
rizzo , there .
you two , in here , set up the pit .
spagna , get three men and stay here .
boys , come here .
three more with me .
take these sandbags .
you two , in here .
de vita , here .
you all , in here .
you three , over here .
remove what you don't need from the pits .
distribute the ammunition .
de vita , knock it off !
i'm fixing it .
fix it some other time .
fine .
i brought some amphetamines .
so you'll stay awake .
get down !
de vita !
where the fuck are you going?
come back here !
finally , war , the real kind , has arrived .
i kept an eye on it , like a bus on the corner of a street .
the british broke through the first line ... but they were stopped by the artillery .
they got stuck in the minefields and had to turn back .
maybe this was the third miracle .
today i looked horror in the face .
lucky is he who dies a hero .
i've seen many of these heroes .
those who die are neither lucky nor unlucky .
they are just dead .
they rot at the bottom of a pit ... without a shred of poetry .
death is beautiful only in school books .
in real life it's pitiful , horrendous ... and it stinks .
this time , i'm going home .
of course .
they'll even give you a medal .
if you're lucky , it'll happen to you , too .
see you back in italy .
see you in italy .
write to me , sergeant .
got it?
write to me .
what do they say?
ii duce deems it necessary to maintain the front at all costs .
win or die .
the big battle moved up north .
it overthrew us like a flooded river .
then , once the flood passed ... it all went back to normal .
it seems they've all forgotten about us .
our enemies and our command .
the days pass , always the same .
we don't know what will happen to us .
we've become rocks , boulders ... immobile , hard .
fear no longer exists , because life no longer exists .
we know we can't win .
we're alone , in the middle of the desert .
alone with our sins .
it's all one great light with no dimensions , no size .
it's all a blinding light ... immense , infinite .
the british broke through up north , the ariete division was destroyed .
and the germans?
they lost almost all of their armored divisions .
rommel decided to retreat , he wants to save the afrika korps .
what are our orders?
what'll we do?
disengage and establish a new line of defense ... 30 kilometers from here , at qaret el khadim .
the folgore division , too?
no .
we're at gebel kalakh .
they stationed us as rearguards .
let's hope for the best .
they say " disengagement " but they mean " retreat .
maybe we'll get our hides home safely .
are they sending trucks?
no , there are none .
we'll have to make do .
may god help us .
look !
the germans !
stop !
italians , you'll die here !
damn germans !
italians !
stop .
stop , for god's sake !
not even the holy spirit could fit in here !
there's plenty of room !
we're full !
let us in !
son of a bitch !
general .
lt. fiore , 27th pavia infantry ... at your orders .
at ease .
can we be of help?
no , i don't need anything .
we can dig .
he was my orderly for 15 years , i want to bury him myself .
you're not wounded?
no .
we're retreating to qaret el khadim .
want us to send a vehicle for you?
thank you .
take cover with your men , don't worry about me .
yes , sir .
whom did i have the honor of speaking to?
it doesn't matter anymore .
good luck .
thanks , your excellency .
i want my shoe back !
here it is !
it's all over , you can go home .
you're going home .
good evening , lieutenant .
where are you going?
to qaret el khadim .
this is it .
where's command?
there isn't one , it's a hospital .
they told us to come here .
the british are everywhere , we've been ordered to retreat to fuka .
how will we get to fuka?
that truck is leaving soon .
get on and leave the injured behind .
what will you do?
i'm staying here .
we're waiting for the british .
they'll take better care of them .
good luck .
tarozzi !
hello , serra .
lieutenant .
how are you?
here's how i am .
stop !
calm down , there's a shelter !
there it is .
we're there .
stop , you can't enter !
they're shooting , we've got injured men .
you can't go in !
understand?
you don't understand , we won't stay out in this bullet storm .
look !
what a mess !
christ !
lieutenant?
yes , sir .
where are you going?
retreating to fuka , taking the injured to the hospital .
good .
make sure they get better soon ... and go back to the front line as soon as possible .
aren't we retreating?
this is an active war , sometimes we go forward , sometimes we go back .
it's a strategic retreat , temporary .
reinforcements are arriving .
colonel !
we don't have a vehicle .
will you send one for the injured men?
sure , will do .
an italian soldier never loses hope .
if he's willing , he'll always find a way .
shall we go?
stop !
we've come from qaret el khadim .
they told us to go to fuka .
the british are in fuka .
the 10th army corps should gather at marsa matruh .
but that's 100 kilometers away !
we don't have a vehicle , we've got injured men .
those are the orders .
i'll go look for the rest of the column .
we proceed haphazardly .
commands and countermands .
no one knows what's happening , what to do .
we wander through the desert fending for ourselves .
we can only hope something will happen ... anything that will put an end ... to the humiliation of this endless end .
lieutenant , how's the wound?
fine .
want to eat something?
we have some extra canned goods .
no , thanks .
serra .
it's the last one?
eat .
i don't sleep near corpses .
it's not right .
it's not right .
this is a cemetery .
will we make it back home?
we'll make it .
italian soldiers , command has abandoned you .
the war is over for you , surrender !
put down your weapons .
don't resist .
lieutenant !
i'll help you .
look !
maybe they're ours .
start .
start !
lieutenant , there's water .
seems to work .
there's gasoline !
sergeant , help me pull it out !
it won't start .
start !
it's pointless .
start !
it started !
i told you so !
maybe we'll make it .
we won't make it .
i won't make it .
you go .
find a vehicle and come back for me .
i'll wait here .
sergeant , let's go !
i'll help you .
get on that bike .
get on that bike .
i'll stay here .
the lieutenant can't stand up .
you go without me .
