'hi , everybody .
this is your cousin brucie .
whoa ! '
'our summer romances are in full bloom , and everybody , but everybody's in love ! '
'so , cousins , here's a great song from the four seasons . '
that was the summer of 1963 , when everybody called me " baby " and it didn't occur to me to mind .
that was before president kennedy was shot , before the beatles came , when i couldn't wait to join the peace corps and i thought i'd never find a guy as great as my dad .
that was the summer we went to kellerman's .
'ping pong in the west arcade , softball in the east diamond . '
'all you sandy koufaxes , get out there ! '
'complimentary dance lessons in the gazebo . '
oh , my god .
look at that !
mom , i should've brought the coral shoes .
you said i was taking too much .
well , sweetheart , you brought ten pairs .
but the coral shoes matched that dress .
this is not a tragedy .
a tragedy is three men trapped in a mine or police dogs used in birmingham .
monks burning themselves in protest .
butt out , baby .
okay , we got horseshoes on the south lawn in 15 minutes !
we've got splish splash , the water cliffs , down by the lake .
we've got the still life art class .
we got volleyball and croquet .
and for you older folks , we got sacks !
doc !
max !
well , doc , after all these years i finally got you up on my mountain .
so , how's the blood pressure , max?
i want you girls to know if it were not for this man ,
i'd be standing here dead .
billy , get the bags .
right away , doc , right away .
i kept the best cabin for you and your beautiful girls .
hey , thanks a lot .
you want a job here?
there's a merengue class in the gazebo in the next few minutes .
the greatest teacher .
used to be a rockette .
it's his first real vacation in six years , max .
take it easy .
three weeks here , it'll feel like a year .
one , two , three , four !
stomp those grapes and stomp some more !
one , two , three , four !
listen to the music !
sorry .
try your caboose and shake it loose !
one , two , three , four !
start the trance !
now come on , men !
follow me into a round robin !
ladies , the inner circle !
come on , ladies !
god wouldn't have given you maracas if he didn't want you to shake them !
okay now , ladies , when i say " stop " , you're gonna find the man of your dreams .
stop !
now remember , he's the boss on the dance floor , if nowhere else .
mom , dad , i'm going up to the main house to look around .
there are two kinds of help here .
you waiters are all college guys and i went to harvard and yale to hire you .
and why did i do that?
why?
i shouldn't have to remind you .
this is a family place .
that means you keep your fingers out of the water , your hair out of the soup and show the goddamn daughters a good time .
all the daughters .
even the dogs .
schlepp 'em out to the terrace , show 'em the stars .
romance 'em any way you want .
got that , guys?
hey , hold it !
hold it .
well , if it isn't the entertainment staff .
listen , wise ass , you got your own rules .
dance with the daughters .
teach 'em the mambo , the cha cha , anything they pay for .
but that's it .
that's where it ends .
no funny business , no conversations and keep yer hands off !
it's the same at all these places .
some ass in the woods , but no conversation .
watch it , rodriguez .
do you think you can keep that straight , johnny?
what you can and can't lay your hands on?
just put your pickle on everybody's plate , college boy , and leave the hard stuff to me .
sit down , sit down and i'll get you some wine .
thank you , max .
this is dr. and mrs. houseman , baby , lisa .
tthis is your waiter , robbie gould .
yale medical school .
robbie , these people are my special guests .
give them anything they want .
enjoy .
thanks , max .
oh , look at all this leftover food .
are there still starving children in europe?
try southeast asia , ma .
oh , right .
robbie , baby wants to send her leftover pot roast to southeast asia , so anything we don't finish , you wrap up .
max , our baby's gonna change the world .
and what are you gonna do , missy?
oh lisa's gonna decorate it .
she already does .
doc , i want you to meet someone .
my grandson neil .
goes to the cornell school of hotel management .
oh , baby's starting mount holyoke in the fall .
oh , great .

i'm going into the peace corps .
after the final show ,
i'm going to mississippi with a couple of busboys , freedom ride .

mambo !
yeah !
come on !
who's that?
oh , them .
they're the dance people .
they're here to keep the guests happy .
they shouldn't be showing off with each other .
that's not gonna sell lessons .

yeah .

i'm in charge of the games tonight .

was that good for you?
and for being such a good sport , here you go !
you know , i finally met a girl exactly like my mother .
dresses like her , acts like her .
so i brought her home .
my father doesn't like her !
go figure .
hi .
how'd you get here?
i was taking a walk .
go back .
let me help you .
no .
what's up there?
no guests allowed .
house rules .
why don't you go back to the playhouse?
i saw you dancing with little boss man .
can you keep a secret?
your parents would kill you .
max would kill me .
where'd they learn to do that?
where?
i don't know .
kids are doing it in their basements back home .
wanna try it?
come on , baby .
can you imagine dancing like this on the main floor , home of the family fox trot?
max would close the place down first .
that's my cousin , johnny castle .
he got me the job here .
they look great together .
yeah .
you'd think they werea couple , wouldn't you?
aren't they?
nah , not since we were kids .
do you love me !
yo , cous , what's she doing here?
she came with me .
she's with me .
i carried a watermelon .
i carried a watermelon?
bend your knees .
bend your knees .
down .

watch my eyes .
good .
that's better .
good .
now roll this way .
now watch .
look .

'ladies , join our hair raising wig show . '
'try your sandra dee , jackie kennedy '
'or elizabeth taylor cleopatra wig . '
i'll knock with three .
look at that , look at that cute fella .
look at these hands .
they're golden hands .
my god , it's cleopatra !
i feel like such an asp .
you look ten years younger .
'at 10 : 15 , by the pool , we have calisthenics . '
'then on the west porch , we have a symposium by rabbi maurice sherman '
'on the psychology of insult comedians . '
so i say , " ask not what your waiter can do for you , but what you can do for your waiter .
you know , if tips keep up , i'll have enough for my alfa romeo .
that's my favorite car .
ladies , you look very lovely .
baby , would you cover for me tonight?
tell mom and daddy i went to lie down .
where are you going?
to the golf course .
there's a pretty view from the first tee .
good .
thanks .
so , you were really a rockette?
i think you're a wonderful dancer .
yeah , well , my mother kicked me out when i was 16 .
i've been dancing ever since .
it's the only thing i ever wanted to do anyway .
i envy you .
aren't you dancing , doc?
we're waiting for a waltz .
hi , max .
aren't my dance lessons starting to pay off?
you look great , vivian !
terrific !
that's vivian pressman , one of the bungalow bunnies .
that's what we call the women who stay here all week long .
the husbands only come up on weekends .
moe pressman's a big card player .
he'll join our game .
moe coming up on friday?
friday .
he's away a lot .
i know .
it's a hardship .
where's penny?
everybody's been asking for her .
what do you mean , where's penny?
she's taking a break .
she needs a break .
as long as it's not an all night break .
come on , doll .
let's take a walk .
i love to watch your hair blowing in the breeze .
maybe my parents are looking for me .
baby , don't worry .
if they think you're with me , they'll be the happiest parents at kellerman's .
i have to say it .
i'm known as the catch of the county .
i'm sure you are .
last week ,
i took a girl away from jamie , the lifeguard .
and he said to her , right in front of me , " what does he have that i don't have?
and she said , " two hotels .
robbie .
i don't hear an apology .
go back to mommy and daddy and keep listening , lisa .
maybe you'll hear one in your dreams .
i'm sorry you had to see that .
sometimes in this world ... ... you see things you don't wanna see .
you hungry?
come on .
so , baby , what do you want?
you can have anything you want .
a brownie , some milk , leftover rice pudding ... ... beets , leftover cabbage roll ...
... fruit salad , sweet gherkins?
oh , neil , look , i'm sorry .
i better go check on lisa .
yeah .
why's she here?
i brought her in case neil comes back .
penny just doesn't think .
she wouldn't do anything stupid , would she?
so , what's wrong?
what's the matter with her?
she's knocked up , baby .
billy !
what's he gonna do about it?
" what's he gonna do about it?
oh , it's mine , right?
right away you think it's mine .
but i thought the ...
it's okay .
okay .
johnny's here .
johnny's here .
it's okay .
it's okay .
i'm never gonna let anything happen to you .
we got to go .
just hold on .
just hold on .
good girl .
good girl .
what do you think you're doing?
you're in trouble , you talk to me .
i'll take care of it .
you should've come to me in the first place .
forget it , johnny .
i'm not taking what's left of your salary .
penny , that's my business .
besides , it wouldn't be enough .
oh , god , it's hopeless !
don't say that .
there's gotta be a way to work it out .
baby?
is that your name?
well , you know what , baby?
you don't know shit about my problems .
i told her .
jesus , billy !
now she's gonna run and tell her little management boyfriend and then we'll all get fired .
why not skywrite it?
penny got knocked up by robbie , the creep .
robbie? !
look ...
no , baby , baby .
one of the counselors knows a doctor , a real md , just traveling through new paltz for one day next week .
we can get her an appointment , but it'd cost $250 .
but if it's robbie , there's no problem .
i know he has the money .
i'm sure if you tell him ...
he knows .
go back to your playpen ...
baby .
and just where do you get off telling me what's right?
but you can't just leave her .
i mean ...
i didn't blow a summer hauling toasted bagels just to bail out some little chick who probably ball every guy in the place .
a little precision please , baby .
some people count and some people don't .
read it .
i think it's a book you'll enjoy .
but make sure you return it .
i have notes in the margin .
you make me sick .
stay away from me , stay away from my sister or i'll have you fired .
what am i doing wrong?
you're lining it up a little wrong , marge .
you know , if your mother ever leaves me , it'll be for arnold palmer .
daddy , someone's in trouble .
besides your mother?
now , you're overcorrecting , marge .
you always told me if someone was in trouble , i should try to help .
could you lend me $250?
are you all right , baby?
are you in some kind of trouble?
no , no , it's not me .
could you loan it to me?
that's a lot of money , baby .
what's it for?
baby , stand up straight .
i can't tell you .
it's hard for me to say that to you , but i can't .
you always said you could tell me anything .
i can't tell you this .
it's not illegal , is it?
no , daddy .
that was a stupid thing to ask .
forgive me .
i'll have it for you before dinner .
is everything all right?
fine .
thanks .
here's money .
you mean robbie?
no , you were right about him .
then where'd you get it?
you said you needed it .
is this kid for real?
yeah , takes a real saint to ask daddy .
thanks , baby , but i can't use it .
what?
what's the matter with you?
you should take the money .
i can only get her an appointment for thursday .
they do their act at the sheldrake on thursday night .
if they cancel , they lose this season's salary and next year's gig .
what's the sheldrake?
it's another hotel where they do their mambo act .
can't someone else fill in?
no , " miss fix it " .
somebody else can't fill in .
maria has to work all day , she can't learn the routines .
and janet has to fill in for penny .
everybody works here .
what , do you wanna do it?
you wanna take time out from " simon says "?
it's not a bad idea .
it was a joke , billy .
she can move .
no , it's the dumbest idea i ever heard of .
i can't even do the merengue .
see?
johnny , you're a strong partner .
you can lead anybody .
but you heard her .
she can't even do the merengue .
she can't do it .
she cannot do it .
oh , sorry .
sorry .
no !
oh !
you don't step on the one .
you gotta start on the two .
find the two .
you understand?
i told you i never did any of these dances before .

you're getting wet , right?
you're wild .

now , the most important thing to remember in lifts is balance .
i got it now .
so where'd you learn to be a dancer?
well , this guy came into this luncheonette one day and ... ... you know , we were all sitting around doing nothing .
and he said that arthur murray was giving a test for instructors .
so , if you passed ...
... they teach you all this different kinds of dances , show you how to break 'em down , how to teach 'em , you know .
what?
no .
good .
no , don't look down .
right here .

good try .
now , you'll hurt me if you don't trust me , all right?
now go , go .
go .
good .
now , i'm gonna go up , all right?
you know , the best place to practice lifts is in the water .
you just bend your knees .
and ... go .
good .

good .
now hold the position .
hold it .
good .
don't break !

and remember , let him lead you .
i'm afraid i'm gonna forget to spike , get dizzy and fall on my face .

i'm gonna ...
i don't look at my feet , keep my head up , my eyes open ... ... tension in my arm , my frame locked , seat pulled up ...
thanks , baby .
look , i just want you to know that i don't sleep around ... ... whatever robbie might have told you .
and i thought that he loved me .
i thought it was something special .

yes , but i mean the way he was with you .
it's really me it has to do with .
johnny , i came here because my father ...
no .
the way he saved her ...
i mean , i could never do anything like that .
that was something .
i mean , the reason people treat me like i'm nothing is because i'm nothing .
that's not true !
you ... you're everything !
you don't understand the way it is ... ... i mean , for somebody like me .
last month , i'm eating jujubes to keep alive .
this month , women are stuffing diamonds in my pockets .
i'm balancing on shit , as quick as that i can be down there again .
no , it's not the way it is !
it doesn't have to be that way !
i've never known anybody like you .
you look at thew world and you think you can make it better .
somebody's lost , you find 'em .
somebody's bleeding and ...

i mean ... you're not scared of anything .
i don't ...

i'm scared of everything !
i'm scared of what i saw .

you come from the streets and suddenly you're up here .
and these women ... ... they are throwing themselves at you and they smell so good .
and they really take care of themselves .
i mean ...
i'd never known women could be like that , you know .
and they're so rich , they're so goddamn rich you think they must know about everything .
and they're slippin 'their room keys in my hands two and three times a day
different women .
so here i think i'm scorin 'big , right?
and ... oh why , you think " hey ... " " ... they wouldn't be doing this if they didn't care about me , right?

it wasn't like that .
they were using me .
what's your real name , baby?
frances .
for the first woman in the cabinet .
frances .
that's a ... ... that's a real grownup name .
i've decided to go all the way with robbie .
oh lisa , no , not with someone like him .
do you think if we came back here for a tenth anniversary , it would be free?
it's ... it's just wrong this way .
it should be with someone ... ... it should be with someone that ... ... that you sort of love .
oh come on .
you don't care about me .
you wouldn't care if i humped the entire army ... ... as long as i were on the right side of the ho chi minh trail .
what you care about is that you're not daddy's girl anymore .

i'd like to shake things up a bit .
you know , move with the times .
yeah?
yeah .
yeah ...
i've got a lot o 'ideas .
the ...
i've been working with the staff kids on a ... ... on a something like cross between this cuban rhythm and this soul dancing .
like those ...
whoa , whoa , boy .
it's a way over your head here .
now ...
i thought , you always do the mambo , huh?
now , why not dance this year's final dance ... ... to the pachanga?
right .
well , you're free to do the same , tired number as last year if you want ... ... but next year we'll find another dance person ...
... who'll only be too happy ...
sure , neil .
no problem .
we'll end the season with the pachanga .
great idea .
sometimes he's hard to talk to , but the ladies seem to like him .
see that he gives you the full half hour you're paying him for , kid .
that little wimp .
he wouldn't know a new idea if it hit him in the pachanga .
he wants some new ideas .
i could have told him some new ideas .
oh , why did you let him talk to you that way?
what do you mean , and fight the boss man?
yeah , tell him your ideas .
he's a person like everyone else and ...
look , i know these people , baby .
they are rich and they're mean .
they won't listen to me .
well , then why not fight harder?
make them listen .
because i need this goddamned job lined up for next summer .
my dad calls me today .
good news , " you know , he says , " uncle paul could finally get you in the union .
oh , what union?
the house painters and plasterers , local number 179 , at your service .
i've been thinking a lot about the domino theory .
now , if vietnam falls , is china next?
i don't think they saw us .
fight harder , huh?
i don't see you fightin 'so hard , baby ,
i don't see you runnin 'of to daddy tellin 'him i'm your guy .
i will .
with my father , it's complicated .
i will tell him .
i don't believe you , baby .
i don't think ... ... that you ever had any intention o 'tellin 'him .
ever .
'well , cousins , it's almost over .
labor day weekend is here . '
'and soon it's back to the old books and back to work .
what a terrible thought ! '
hi , have you seen johnny?
i'm sorry .
hey , well , it looks like i picked the wrong sister .
that's okay , baby .
i went slummin 'too .
johnny !
come on !
hit me .
hit me .
johnny !
get outa here .
you're not worth it .
you're not worth it .
hi , vivian .
win big , moe .
as always .
yeah .
this is our last night together , lover .
i've got something worked out for us .
oh , excuse me , sir .
the pirate number's next .
oh yeah , thanks .
hey , kid .
listen , you know i'm playing cards all weekend and i've got an all night game tonight .
why don't you ... ... give my wife some extra dance lessons?
i'm sorry , mr. pressman , but ... ... i'm booked up for the whole weekend , you know , with the show and everything , so i won't have time for anything else .
i don't think it'd be fair to take the money .
i've decided tonight's the night with robbie .
he doesn't even know yet .
oh hey , lisa ...
robie .
it's me .
holy shit !
you wanna hear somethin 'crazy?
come on , " and he put his arm around me ... ... just like he did with robbie .
you know how you feel when you see a patient and ... ... you think he's all right , then you look at the x rays and this is nothing like you thought?
what happened , max?
it's exactly what it's like when you find out one of your staff's a thief .
moe pressman's wallet was stolen when he was playing pinochle last night .
it was in his jacket hanging on the back of his chair .
he had it at 1 : 30 and when he checked again at quarter of four ... ... it was missing .
vivian thinks she remembers this dance kid ... ...
johnny walking by .
you have an alibi for last night?
he says he was alone in his room reading .
yeah , there are no books in johnny's room !
there's been a mistake .
i know johnny didn't do it .
there've been similar thefts at the sheldrake and it's happened here before .
three other wallets .
i know he didn't do it .
stay out of it , baby .
wait .
don't put those tables together .
come on .
daddy , i need your help .
i know johnny didn't take moe's wallet .
i know .
oh?
how do you know?
i can't tell you .
but just please trust me , daddy .
i'm sorry , baby .
i can't .
this danish is pure protein .
mr. kellermanm , look .
maybe johnny didn't do it .
anyone could've taken it .
maybe it was , uh ...
you know , it could've been that little old couple , the schumachers .
i saw her with a couple of wallets .
sylvia and sidney?
baby , you don't go around accusing innocent people .
yeah , but i saw them .
i even saw them at the sheldrake .
didn't you say something was stolen at the sheldrake .
i got an eyewitness and the kid has no alibi .
come on , neil .
you'll learn what it's like to fire an employee .
no , mr. kellerman , wait a minute .
i know johnny didn't take the wallet .
i know he didn't take it , because he was in his room all night .
and the reason i know ... ... is because i was with him .
i told you i was telling the truth , daddy .
i'm sorry i lied to you .
but you lied too .
you've told me everyone was alike and deserved a fair break .
but you meant everyone who was like you .
you told me you wanted me to change the world , make it better .
but you meant by becoming a lawyer or an economist and marrying someone from harvard .
i'm not proud of myself .
but i'm in this family too and you can't keep giving me the silent treatment .
there are a lot of things about me that aren't what you thought .
but if you love me , you have to love all the things about me .
and i love you .
i'm sorry i let you down .
i'm so sorry , daddy .
but you let me down too .
i have been lookin 'for you all over .
they found the schumachers .
they fingerprinted their water glasses .
they found out they were wanted in arizona and florida and they made a fortune here this summer .
so then ... then it's all right .
i knew it'd work out .
i knew they'd have to apologize ...
i'm out , baby .
they fired you anyway because of me .
and if i leave quietly , i'll get my summer bonus .
so i did it for nothing .
i hurt my family , you lost your job anyway i did it for nothing !
no , no , not for nothing , baby !
nobody has ever done anything like that for me before .
you were right , johnny .
you can't win no matter what you do .
you listen to me .
i don't wanna hear that from you .
you can !
i used to think so .
dr. houseman , can i , uh ...
look , i'm going anyway and ...
i know what you must be thinking ...
you don't know anything about me .
anything at all .
i know you want baby to be like you .
the kind of person that does things to make other people look up to them .
dr. houseman , baby is like that !
i mean , if you could just see ...
don't you tell me what to see .
i see someone in front of me who ... ... got his partner in trouble and sent her off to some butcher , while he moved on to an innocent young girl like my daughter .
yeah , i guess that's what you would see .
well .
i can't imagine me being here without you even one day .
well , i just think , you have more time for ... horseshoes and croquet .
maybe they'll ... saw you in seven pieces now .
i guess we surprised everybody .
i guess we did .
hardly would be sorry .
neither will l .
i'll see ya .
baby?
i'll do your hair .
it could look pretty if ...
no .
you're prettier your way .
this way .
kellermans , we come together
singing all as one
we have shared another season's
talent , play and fun
summer days will soon be over
soon the autumn starts
and tonight the memories whisper
softly in our hearts
join hands and hearts and voices
voices , hearts and hands
at kellerman's the friendships last long
as the mountain stands
daytime , nighttime any hour
whether rain or shine
games and lectures jokes and music
happily combine
join hands and hearts and voices
voices , hearts and hands
robbie .
good luck in medical school , son .
and i wanted to thank you for your help with the penny situation .
i guess we've all gotten into messes like this .
what?
i thought baby told you .
look , i'm not sure .
i mean , penny said so , but ... ... you know with girls like that .
they're liable to pin it on any guy around .
hello , landsman .
what's the hot tip for the day?
finished .
you and me , tito .
we've seen it all , eh?
bubba and zeda serving the first pasteurized milk to the boarders .
through the war years when we didn't have any meat .
through the depression when we didn't have anything .
lots of changes , though , max .
lots of changes .
it's not the changes so much this time , you know .
it's ...
it's that it all seems to be ending .
you think kids wanna come with their parents and take fox trot lessons?
trips to europe , that's what the kids want .
twenty two countries in three days .
it feels like it's all slipping away .
but the heartbeats of vacation
where no cares are seen
so let's join in just one last chorus
visitors , staff and guest
what we've shared won't be forgotten
old friends are the best
join hands and hearts and voices
voices , hearts and hands
at kellerman's the friendships last long
as the mountain stands
it's johnny?
johnny?
hey .
hey johnny !
it's johnny !
what's he doing here?
nobody puts baby in a corner .
come on .
but the heartbeats of vacation
where no cares are seen
join hands and hearts and voices
voices , hearts and hands
at kellerman's the ...
sorry about the disruption , folks ... ... but i always do the last dance of the season .
this year somebody told me not to .
so i'm gonna do my kind of dancin 'with a great partner ... ... who's not only a terrific dancer ... ... but somebody who's taught me ... ... that there are people willing to stand up for other people , no matter what it costs 'em .
somebody ... who's taught me ... ... about the kind of person i wanna be .
miss frances houseman .
sit down , jake .
i think she gets this from me .
do you have sheet music on this stuff?
i know you weren't the one who got penny in trouble .
yeah?
when i'm wrong , i say i'm wrong .
you looked wonderful out there .
now l
had the time of my life
no , i never felt this way before
yes , i swear
it's so true and i owe it all to you
