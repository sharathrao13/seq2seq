you don't like flying , do you?
what gives you that idea?
you want to know the secret to surviving air travel?
after you get where you're going , take off your shoes and socks .
then you walk around on the rug barefoot and make fists with your toes .
fists with your toes?
i know .
it sounds crazy .
trust me .
i've been doing it for nine years .
yes , sir !
better than a shower and a hot cup of coffee .
ok .
it's ok .
i'm a cop .
trust me .
i've been doing this for 11 years .
on behalf of the captain and the crew , ... .. i'd like to welcome you to los angeles .
have a very merry christmas .

you're making me feel like ebenezer scrooge .

mcclane residence .
lucy mcclane speaking .
hello , lucy mcclane .
this is your mother speaking .
mommy !

you'll be in bed when i get there , though .
let me talk to paulina , ok , hon?
and no snooping around the house looking for presents .
is daddy coming home with you?
well , we'll see what ... .. santa and mommy can do , ok?
put paulina on .
bye , honey .
paulina !
hola , mrs. holly .
um , did mr. mcclane call?
no , mrs. holly .
no telefono .
he probably didn't have time before his flight .
it might be a good idea to make up the spare bedroom ... .. just in case .
si , mrs. holly .
i do that already .
what would i do without you , paulina?
california !
hey , i'm john mcclane .
argyle .
i'm your limo driver .
nice bear .
ok ...
argyle .
what do we do now?
i was , uh , hoping you could tell me .
it's my first time driving a limo .
that's ok .
it's my first time riding in one .
we got everything in this mug , man .
look at this ...
cd , cb , tv , ... .. telephone , full bar , vhs .
if your friend's hot to trot , ... .. i know a few mama bears we can hook up with .
or is he married?
he's married .
ok .
sorry about that .
it's the girl's day off .
i didn't know you were gonna sit up front .
your lady lives out here?
about the past six months .
meaning you still live in new york?
you always ask this many questions , argyle?
sorry .
i used to drive a cab and people would expect a little chitchat .
so , you divorced?
just drive the car , man .
hey , come on .
you divorced?
you separated?
she beat you up !?
she had a good job .
it turned into a great career .
that meant she had to move here .
you're very fast , argyle .
so , why didn't you come?
why didn't you come with her?
because i'm a new york cop .
i got a backlog of new york scumbags i'm still trying to put behind bars .
i can't just go that easy .
you thought she wasn't gonna make it out here ... .. and she'd come crawling back to you so why bother to pack , right?
like i said , you're very fast , argyle .
mind if we hear some tunes?
hey , that'll work .
don't you got any christmas music?
this is christmas music .
so your lady sees you , you run into each other's arms , ... .. the music comes up and you live happily ever after , right?
i can live with that .
so , if it doesn't work out , you got a place to stay?
i'll find a place .
i tell you what ...
i'll wait in the parking garage .
you score , give me a call on the car phone .
i'll take your bags to the desk .
you strike out , i'll get you a hotel .
you're all right , argyle .
remember that when you sign for the tip .
hi .
good evening .
i'm here to see holly mcclane .
just type it in there .
cute toy .
yeah , if you have to take a leak , it'll even help you find your zipper .
christ .
thirtieth floor?
the party .
they're the only ones left in the building .

i couldn't agree with you more .

hi .
i'm looking for ...
holly gennero .
yeah .
then you must be john mcclane .
joe takagi .
how was your ride in?
nice .
i have you to thank for that?
seemed the least we could do .
quite a place you have here .
it will be if we ever get it finished .
still several floors under construction .
holly went to fax some documents .
she should be back any minute .
in the meanwhile , her office is back here .
ellis?
i was just making a call .
this was the nearest phone .
i want you to meet john mcclane , ... .. holly's husband .
holly's policeman .
ellis is in charge of international development .
heard a lot about you .
you missed some .
can i get you anything?
food?
cake?
some watered down champagne?
no , thank you .
i'm fine .
you throw quite a party .
i didn't realise they celebrated christmas in japan .
we're flexible .
pearl harbor didn't work out , so we got you with tape decks .
it's sort of a double celebration .
we closed a pretty big deal today ... .. and a lot of it was due to holly .
right , joe?
i'll be out in a couple of minutes .
john .
have you met everyone?
we've been sticking him with spears .
of course he has .
she was made for the business .
tough as nails .
i was hoping you made that flight .
show him the watch .
later .
show him .
are you embarrassed?
it's just a small token of appreciation ... .. for all her hard work .
it's a rolex .
i'm sure i'll see it later .
is there a place where i could wash up?
sure .
you have to forgive ellis .
he gets very depressed this time of year .
he thought he was god's greatest gift , you know?
i know the type .
i think he's got his eye on you .
that's ok .
i have my eye on his private bathroom .
where are you staying?
things happened so fast ... .. l didn't get a chance to ask you on the phone .
cappy roberts retired out here .
oh , yeah?
he said i could bunk with him .
cappy retired , huh?
where's he live?
romona .
ha !
pomona .
huh?
pomona .
pomona .
yeah .
you'll be in the car half the time .
why don't we make it easy?
i have a spare bedroom .
it's not huge or anything , but ... .. the kids would love to have you at the house .
they would , huh?
i would , too .
ha ha !
ooh !
sorry .
i missed you .
didn't miss my name , though , huh?
except maybe when you're signing cheques?
since when did you start using ms gennero?
this is a japanese company .
they figure a married woman's ...
you are a married woman .
this conversation again?
we did this in july .
we never finished this conversation .
i had an opportunity .
i had to take it .
no matter what it did to our marriage .
it only changed your idea of our marriage .
you have no clue what my idea ...
i know exactly what your idea of our marriage should be .
ms gennero , i ...
excuse me .
hi .
um , mr. takagi is looking for you .
he wants you to say something to the troops .
thank you .
speech time .
be back in a few minutes .
that was great , john .
good job .
very mature .
so kareem rebounds .
feeds worthy on the break , over to ac , to magic , ... .. then back to worthy .
boom !
two points .
we're in .
links ... .. rechts ... .. und wieder links .
son of a bitch .
ha ha !
fists with your toes .
yeah , argyle?
how's it going?
all right .
where are you?
down at the garage .
what's with you and your lady?
the vote's not in yet .
hey , bruder .
moment .
nein !
nein !
nein !
argyle?
mac , you there?
hello?
you know the number .
use it .
stay calm .
everything's going to be fine .
everything's going to be fine .
shit !
think .
think .
ladies and gentlemen .
ladies and gentlemen .
due to the nakatomi corporation's legacy of greed around the globe ... .. they're about to be taught a lesson in the real use of power .
you will be witnesses .
now ... .. where is mr. takagi?
joseph yashinobo takagi , ... .. born kyoto , 1937 ...
family emigrated to san pedro , california , 1939 , ... .. interned at manzanar , 1942 to '43 , ... .. scholarship student , university of california , ... .. 1955 .
law degree , stanford , 1962 .
mba , harvard , 1970 .
president , nakatomi trading .
vice chairman , nakatomi investment group ...
enough .
and father ... .. of five .
i am takagi .
how do you do?
it's a pleasure to meet you .
ok , 32 ... construction , 33 ... computers .
nice suit .
john phillips , london .
i have two myself .
rumour has it arafat buys his there .
this way?
on the left .
and when alexander saw the breadth of his domain ... .. he wept , for there were no more worlds to conquer .
the benefits of a classical education .
ohh , that's beautiful .
i always enjoyed to make models when i was a boy .
the exactness , the attention to every conceivable detail .
it's beautiful .
is this what this is all about?
our project in indonesia?
contrary to what you people may think , ... .. we're going to develop that region , not exploit it .
i believe you .
i read the article in forbes .
mr. takagi ...
i could talk about industrialisation and men's fashions all day ... .. but i'm afraid work must intrude ... .. and my associate here has some questions for you .
sort of fill in the blanks questions , actually .
i don't have that code .
you broke in here to access our computer?
any information you could get ... .. when they wake up in tokyo , they'll change it .
you won't be able to blackmail our executives ...
sit ... down !
mr. takagi , i'm really not interested in your computer .
but i need the code key ... .. because i am interested in the $640 million ... .. in negotiable bearer bonds that you have locked in your vault ... .. and the computer controls the vault .
you want money?
what kind of terrorists are you?
who said we were terrorists?
the bonds represent , at most ... .. 10 days 'operating capital for your parent organisation .
it's really no more than a temporary inconvenience .
now ...
.. the code , please .
it's useless to you .
there are seven safeguards on our vault and the code key's only one of them .
you'll never get it open .
then there's no reason not to tell it to us .
i told you .
it's not over yet .
it's a very nice suit , mr. takagi .
it would be a shame to ruin it .
i'm going to count to three .
there will not be a four .
give me the code .
one , ... .. two , ... .. three , ...
i don't know it .
get on a jet to tokyo and ask the chairman .
you're just gonna have to kill me .
ok .
we do it the hard way .
tony , see if you can dispose of that .
karl , you better check on heinrich's work up on the machine floor .
nothing .
see to heinrich .
now ... .. you can break the code?
you didn't bring me for my charming personality .
argyle , tell me you heard the shots .
you're calling the police right now .
of course i'm still coming by later .
sweetheart , have i ever lied to you?
my boss?
he thinks i'm on my way to vegas .
uli , get up on the pipes .
marco , you go through here .
i'll throw you the cord .
hans , we're on the roof .
here .
uli .
30 minutes to break the code , ... .. two hours , two and a half hours for the five mechanicals , at the minimum .
the 7th lock , however , is out of my hands .
i'm sorry?
the 7th lock ... the electromagnetic seal .
you do understand the circuits cannot be cut locally?
trust me .
why the fuck didn't you stop him , john?
'cause then you'd be dead , too , asshole .
think , goddamn it !
think !
we've got a fire alarm .
call 911 .
give them the guard's name and cancel the alarm .
then disable the sys ...
eddie , on what floor did the alarm go off?
shall we go?
nein .
yes .
hello , baby .
come to papa .
come on .
ah ha ha ha !
come on , baby .
come on , baby .
come on , baby .
come to papa .
i'll kiss your fuckin 'dalmatian .
you stupid motherfuckers !
no !
no !
turn the fuckin 'truck around !
the fire has been called off , my friend .
no one is coming to help you .
you might as well come out and join the others .
i promise i won't hurt you .
drop it , dickhead .
it's the police .
you won't hurt me .
yeah?
why not?
because you're a policeman .
there are rules for policemen .
yeah , that's what my captain keeps telling me .
bet your ass i wish to proceed .
nine million terrorists in the world ... .. and i got to kill one with feet smaller than my sister .
i wanted this to be professional , ... .. efficient , adult , cooperative .
not a lot to ask .
alas , your mr. takagi did not see it that way ... .. so he won't be joining us for the rest of his life .
we can go any way you want it .
you can walk out of here or be carried out ... .. but have no illusions ... we are in charge .
so ... decide now , each of you ... .. and please remember ... .. we have left nothing to chance .
it's tony !
get them back !
now i have a machine gun .
ho ... ho ... ho .
a security guard we missed?
they're usually tired old policemen .
no , this is something else .
we have to do something , hans .
yes , we do .
tell karl his brother is dead .
tell him to come down .
karl ... komm so fort .
franco , fritz , take the body upstairs ... .. and out of sight .
i don't want the hostages to think too much .
komm sofort .
schnell .
i want blood !
you'll have it , but let heinrich plant the detonators ... .. and theo prepares the vault .
after we call the police , ... .. you can tear the building apart looking for this man ... .. but until then , do not alter the plan !
and if he alters it?
what do you think?
something's wrong .
cops?
john .
john?
he can fuck this whole thing up .
what does he think he's doing?
his job .
bullshit .
his job's 3, 000 miles away .
without him , we still have a chance to get out of here .
tell that to takagi .
mayday , mayday , anyone copying channel nine .
terrorists have seized the nakatomi building ... .. and are holding at least 30 people hostage .
i repeat .
unknown number of terrorists ... .. six or more armed with automatic weapons ... .. at nakatomi plaza , ... .. century city .
where's the best place to transmit?
the roof !
go !
go !
it's the same address as that fire signal .
i'll handle it .
attention , whoever you are , ... .. this channel is reserved for emergency calls only .
no fucking shit , lady !
do i sound like i'm ordering a pizza?
no one kills him but me .
they have already killed one hostage .
they are fortifying their positions while you're jerkin 'me off on the radio !
sir , i've already told you .
this is a reserved channel .
if this is an emergency call , dial 911 on your telephone .
otherwise , i'll report this as an fcc violation .
fine !
report me !
come the fuck down here and arrest me !
just send the police now !
see if a black and white can drive by .
thought you guys just ate doughnuts .
they're for my wife .
yeah .
she's pregnant .
yeah .
bag it .
big time .
thanks .

the elevators are locked off .
he can't escape .
just shut him in and come back down .
oh , fuck .
karl , the police are probably on their way ... .. already .
karl?
christ .
i can stall them , but not if they hear gunshots .

eddie?
i had a feelin 'you'd be calling .
evenin ', officer .
what can i do for you?
we had that false alarm .
you ask me , that goddamn computer sent you ... .. on another wild goose chase .
they have been chasing bugs in this system ever since they installed it . .. notre dame on top of usc .
aw , shit !
i got 50 bucks bet on them assholes .
come on , come on , where's the fucking cavalry?

i need backup assistance now !
now , goddamn it !

never thought i'd love to hear that sound .
all of you relax .
this is a matter of inconvenient timing , that's all .
police action was inevitable ... .. and , as it happens , necessary .
so , let them fumble about outside and stay calm .
this is simply the beginning .
i told you all i wanted radio silence until ...
i'm very sorry , hans .
i didn't get that message .
maybe you should have put it on the bulletin board .
i figured since i waxed tony and marco and his friend here , ... .. l figured you and karl and franco might be lonely ... .. so i wanted to give you a call .
how does he know so much about us?
that's very kind of you .
i assume you are our mysterious party crasher .
you are most troublesome ... .. for a security guard .
eeeh !
sorry , hans .
wrong guess .
would you like to go for double jeopardy where the scores can really change?
mm , these are very bad for you .
who are you , then?
just the fly in the ointment , hans .
the monkey in the wrench , ... .. the pain in the ass .
whoa !
check on all the others .
don't use the radio .
see if he's lying about marco ... .. and find out if anyone else is missing .
mr. mystery guest , ... .. are you still there?
yeah , i'm still here ... .. unless you want to open the front door for me .
no , i'm afraid not ... .. but you have me at a loss .
you know my name , but who are you?
just another american who saw too many movies as a child?
another orphan of a bankrupt culture ... .. who thinks he's john wayne , rambo , marshal dillon?
i was always partial to roy rogers , actually .
i liked those sequined shirts .
do you really think you have a chance against us , mr. cowboy?
yippee ki yay , motherfucker .
i'll beat everyone if i get a remote .
sam , i don't have the new pages .
harvey , keep your pants on .
sam , i'm begging you .
simon's with the remote .
i'll tell him to swing by .
i won't sit on this !
this is my story !
i'm going out there !
look , sam .
tell you what .
you don't give me a truck , i'll steal a truck .
give us a break , thornburg .
eat it , harvey ! .. four , three , two , ... .. one .
harvey , we're on the air .
good evening .
this is harvey johnson .
and i'm gail wallens .
this is nightline news at 10 . 00 .
our top stories on this christmas eve ...
take truck number five .
get out of here .
he wasn't lying about marco .
he's down on the street .
the other man was heinrich ... .. and his bag is missing .
he had the detonator .
theo .
theo .
yo !
we may have some problems .
how's our schedule?
three down , four to go .
then don't waste time ... .. talking to me .
this is sergeant al powell ... .. of the los angeles police department .
if the person who radioed for help ... .. can hear me on this channel , ... .. acknowledge this transmission .
i say again , ... .. if the person who radioed for help can hear me , ... .. acknowledge this transmission !
i read you , pal .
you the guy in the car?
what's left of him .
can you identify yourself? .
not now .
maybe later .
listen fast .
this is a party line .
the neighbours got itchy trigger fingers .
all right , here's the deal .
you got 30 or so hostages on the 30th floor .
the leader's name is hans .
we have to find him and shut him up .
he's telling them everything !
let him .
i'm waiting for the fbl .
he can waste as much time as he likes ... .. but we must find the bag , fritz .
they have a freakin'arsenal here .
we must have the detonators .
they got missiles , automatic weapons , ... .. and enough plastic explosives to orbit arnold schwarzenegger .
they're down to nine now , counting the skydiver you met .
these guys are mostly european ... .. judging by their clothing labels and ...
.. cigarettes .
they're well financed and very slick .
how do you know that?
i've seen enough phoney ids in my time ... .. to recognise the ones they got must have cost a fortune .
add all that up .
i don't know what the fuck it means ... .. but you got some bad ass perpetrators ... .. and they're here to stay .
i hear you , partner .
la's finest are on it , ... .. so light 'em if you got 'em .
way ahead of you , partner .
so what do i call you?
call me ... .. roy .
listen up , roy , if you think of anything else ... .. don't be shy , ok?
in the meantime , find a safe place and let us do our job .
they're all yours , al .
who's talking to 'em?
i am , sir .
sergeant powell .
ai powell .
dwayne robinson .
what's the deal?
what do these pricks want?
if you mean the terrorists , ... .. we haven't heard a peep from them .
who have you been talking to?
we don't know .
he won't give us his name .
but he appears to be the one who phoned .
he's killed one terrorist for sure and claims he capped off two others .
he claims?
powell , has it occurred to you ... .. he could be one of the terrorists pulling your chain ... .. or some nutcase in there?
i don't think so .
in fact , i think he's a cop , ... .. maybe not lapd , but he's definitely a badge .
how do you know that?
a hunch ... things he said ... .. like being able to spot a phoney id .
jesus christ , powell !
he could be a fucking bartender for all we know !
tv's here .
oh , shit .
i have a request .
what idiot put you in charge?
you did ... .. when you murdered my boss .
now everybody's looking to me .
personally , i'd pass on the job .
i don't enjoy being this close to you .
go on .
we have a pregnant woman .
relax .
she's not due for a couple weeks ... .. but sitting on that rock isn't doing her back any good .
so i'd like permission to move her to an office with a sofa .
no , but i'll have a sofa brought out .
good enough?
good enough .
and unless you like it messy , ... .. start bringing us in groups to the bathroom .
yes .
you're right .
it will be done .
was there something else?
no , thank you .
mr. takagi chose his people well , mrs ..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................?
gennero .
ms gennero .
we interrupt this programme for a special news bulletin .
this is richard thornburg live from century city .
tonight , los angeles has joined the sad and worldwide fraternity of cities whose only membership requirement is to suffer the anguish of international terrorism .
approximately two hours ago , an unidentified group of men seized control of the nakatomi building , sealing off all entrances and exits .
all telephone lines have been cut and the only communication now possible has been through the use of cb communicators which the group apparently brought with them .
according to official sources , the perpetrators of this building siege ...
unit five , hold your position in the main entrance .
we got charlie unit in position by the parking structure .
let me ask you something .
does this stairway go up to the escalator?
yeah .
tell them to go ahead .
what's going on?
what's it look like?
we're going in .
going in?
man , that's crazy !
there could be over 30 hostages in there for all we know .
we don't know shit , powell .
if there's hostages , how come there were no ransom demands?
if there's terrorists in there , where's their list of demands?
all we know is that somebody shot your car up .
it's probably the same silly son of a bitch you've been talking to on that radio .
excuse me , sir , but what about the body that fell out the window?
probably some stockbroker got depressed .
we're ready , chief .
light 'em up .
let's go .
hit your lights .
blue units , go .
lights on !
powell?
powell , you still with me , babe?
what's going on?
yo , al .
i'm here , roy , but i'm kind of busy right now .
i'll talk to you later .
al , what's wrong?
i'll talk to you later .
if you are what i think you are , you'll know when to listen , shut up , and and when to pray .
jesus christ !
you're coming in , right?
christ , powell ,
i told you what kind of people you're dealing with here .
let's load them up .
they'll be coming .
everyone get ready .
theo , you are the eyes now .

we've had an update on the terrorist take over of the nakatomi building .
sources say the terrorist leader , hans , may be this man ...
hans gruber .
a member of the radical west german volksfreimovement .
strangely , the volksfrei leadership issued a communiqu an hour ago stating that gruber had been expelled from that organisation .
al , do you copy?
are you all right?
yeah , i'm fine .
w what was that?
remember that plastic explosive i told you about?
there you go .
is the building on fire?
no , but it's gonna need a paint job and a shitload of screen doors .
our spotter said you got two with that blast .
is that him?
yes , sir .
i don't know who you think you are but you just destroyed a building .
we do not want your help .
is that clear?
we don't want your help .
i've got 100 people down here , and they're covered with glass .
glass?
who gives a shit about glass?
who the fuck is this?
this is deputy chief of police dwayne t robinson and i am in charge of this situation .
oh , you're in charge?
i got some bad news for you , dwayne .
from up here it doesn't look like you're in charge of shit .
listen to me , you little asshole ...
asshole?
i'm not the one who just got butt fucked on national tv , dwayne .
ah ha ha !
listen to me , jerk off , if you're not part of the solution , you're part of the problem .
quit being part of the problem and put the other guy back on !
hey , roy , how you feeling?
pretty fucking unappreciated , al .
hey , look .
i love you .
so do a lot of the other guys .
so hang in there , man , you hear me?
you hang in there .
yeah , thanks , partner .
what are you doing?
i'm tired of sitting here waiting to see who gets us killed first , them or your husband .
what are you going to do?
hey , babe ,
i negotiate million dollar deals for breakfast .
i think i can handle this eurotrash .
hey , sprechen sie talk , huh?
if you'd listened to me , he would be neutralised already .
i don't want neutral .
i want dead .
hope i'm not interrupting .
what does he want?
it's not what i want .
it's what i can give you .
look , let's be straight , ok?
it's obvious you're not some dumb schmuck up here to snatch a few purses .
you're very perceptive .
i watch 60 minutes .
i say to myself , these guys are professional , they're motivated , they're happening , they want something .
i couldn't care less about your politics .
maybe you're pissed off at the camel jockeys .
maybe it's the hebes , northern ireland .
it's none of my business .
i figure you're here to negotiate , am i right?
you're amazing .
you figured this all out already?
hey , business is business .
you use a gun , i use a fountain pen .
what's the difference?
let's put it in my terms .
you're here on a hostile takeover .
you grab us for some green but you didn't expect some poison pill was gonna be running around the building .
am i right?
hans , bubbie ...
i'm your white knight .
i must have missed 60 minutes .
what are you saying?
the guy upstairs who's fucking things up , huh?
i can give him to you .
oh , god ...
roy?
roy , you all right?
just trying to fire down a 1, 000 year old twinkie .
what do they put in these things , anyway?
sugar , enriched flour , partially hydrogenated vegetable oil , polysorbate 60 , and yellow dye number five .
just everything a growing boy needs .
how many kids you got , al?
as a matter of fact , my wife is working on our first .
how about you , cowboy?
you got any kids back on your ranch?
yeah .
two .
sure hope i can see them swinging on a jungle gym with al jnr someday .
well , now , that's a date but you bring the ice cream .
touching , cowboy .
touching .
or should i call you
mr. mcclane?
mr. officer john mcclane of the new york police department?
get on the phone to harry in new york .
you better get a hold of somebody at dispatch .
sister theresa called me mr. mcclane in the third grade .
my friends call me john and you're neither , shithead .
i have someone who wants to talk to you .
a very special friend who was with you at the party tonight .
hey , john boy .
ellis?
yeah .
listen , john , they're giving me a few minutes to talk sense into you .
i know you think you're doing your job and i can appreciate that but you're just dragging this thing out .
look , no one gets out of here until these guys can talk to the la police .
that won't happen until you stop messing up the works .
capisce?
ellis , what have you told them?
i told them we were old friends and you were my guest at the party .
ellis , you shouldn't be doing this .
tell me about it .
all right , john , listen .
they want you to tell them where the detonators are .
they know people are listening .
they want the detonators , or they're gonna kill me .
john , didn't you hear me?
yeah , i hear you .
john , get with the programme .
the police are here now .
it's their problem .
tell these guys where the detonators are so no one else gets hurt !
i'm putting my life on the line for you , pal !
ellis , listen to me carefully .
john ...
shut up , ellis !
just shut your mouth !
put hans back on the line .
hans , this shithead doesn't know what kind of man you are but i do .
good .
then you'll give us what we want and save your friend's life .
you're not part of this equation .
hey , what am i , a method actor?
babe , put away the gun .
this is radio , not television .
hans , this asshole is not my friend !
i just met him tonight !
i don't know him !
jesus christ , ellis !
these people will kill you !
tell them you don't know me !
how can you say that after all these years?
john?
john?
do you hear that?
talk to me !
where are my detonators?
where are they , or shall i shoot another one?
sooner or later
i might get to someone you do care about .
go fuck yourself , hans .
he just let the guy die .
he just gave him up .
give me that headset .
that's like pulling the trigger yourself .
can't you see what's happening?
can't you read between the lines?
he did everything he could to save him .
if he gave himself up , they'd both be dead right now !
no way , man .
they'd be talking to us .
you tell this partner of yours to stay out of this from now on .
because if he doesn't , i'm really going to nail his ass .
the man is hurting .
he is alone , tired , and he hasn't seen diddly squat from anybody here !
you're gonna tell me he'll give a damn about what you do to him if he makes it out of there alive?
why don't you wake up and smell what you're shoveling?
you listen to me , sergeant .
any time you want to go home , you consider yourself dismissed .
no , sir .
you couldn't drag me away .
attention , police .
attention , police .
this is sergeant ai powell ...
give me that .
this is deputy chief dwayne robinson .
who is this?
this is hans gruber .
i assume you realise the futility of direct action against me .
we have no wish for further loss of life .
what is it you do wish for?
i have comrades in arms around the world languishing in prison .
the american state department enjoys rattling its sabre for its own ends .
now it can rattle it for me .
the following people are to be released from their captors .
in northern ireland the seven members of the new provo front .
in canada , the five imprisoned leaders of libert de quebec .
in sri lanka , the nine members of the asian dawn .
what the fuck?
asian dawn?
i read about them in time magazine .
when these revolutionary brothers and sisters are free , the hostages in this building will be taken to the roof and they will accompany us in helicopters to the los angeles international airport where they will be given further instructions .
you have two hours to comply .
wait a minute .
uh , mr. gruber .
this is crazy .
i don't have the authority .
two hours is not enough .
hello?
hello !
did you get all that?
we got to make some calls .
do you think they'll even try?
who cares?
theo , are we on schedule?
one more to go , then it's up to you .
you better be right because the last one will take a miracle .
it's christmas , theo .
it's the time of miracles , so be of good cheer and call me when you hit the last lock .
karl , hunt that little shit down and get those detonators .
fritz is checking the explosives .
i'll check the explosives .
you just get the detonators .
hey , powell , you out there?
i'm here , john .
i'm here .
you gotta believe me .
there was nothing i could do .
well , it's gonna be both our asses if you're wrong .
i hear you .
did you catch that bullshit hans was running?
it doesn't make sense , man .
hey , don't ask me , man .
i'm just a desk jockey who was on my way home when you rang .
the way you drove that car i figured you for the street , al .
in my youth .
in my youth . .. author of " hostage terrorist , terrorist hostage ,
a study in duality .
dr hasseldorf , what can we expect in the next few hours?
well , gail , by this time , the hostages should be going through the early stages of the helsinki syndrome .
as in helsinki , sweden .
finland .
basically , it's when the hostages and the terrorists go through a sort of psychological transference and a projection of dependency .
a strange sort of trust and bond develops .
we've had situations where the hostages have embraced their captors after release and even corresponded with them in prison .
no , no , darling .
asian dawn .
dawn .
d a w n.
sir?
yeah?
sir , the fbi is here .
the fbi is here now?
yes , sir .
right over there .
hold this .
want a breath mint?
hey , how you doing , man?
i'm agent johnson .
this is special agent johnson .
oh , how you doing?
no relation .
i'm , uh ...
i'm dwayne robinson , lapd .
i'm in charge here .
not any more .
hi , there .
how you doing?
ohh ...
please , god .
no .
you're one of them , aren't you?
you're one of them .
no !
don't kill me !
please !
don't kill me , please !
please , please , please .
whoa .
relax .
i'm not gonna hurt you .
i'm not gonna hurt you !
oh , god .
what the fuck are you doing up here?
what were you looking for?
i managed to get out of there and
i was just trying to get up on the roof and see if i could signal for help .
it's just over here .
why don't you come and help?
hold it .
forget the roof .
i said forget the roof .
they got people all over it .
you want to stay alive , you stay with me .
the best we can figure it , we've got maybe 30 or 35 hostages up there probably on the 30th floor and maybe seven or eight terrorists up there .
sounds like an a 7 scenario .
thank you .
we'll handle it from here .
when we commandeer your men , we'll try and let you know .
aren't you forgetting something?
such as?
what about john mcclane?
he's the reason we have any information .
he's also the reason you're facing seven terrorists , not twelve .
he's inside?
who is he?
he might be a cop .
we're checking on that .
one of yours?
no , no way .
you smoke?
yeah .
thanks .
you don't work for nakatomi .
and if you're not one of them ...
i'm a cop from new york .
new york?
yeah .
got invited to the christmas party by mistake .
who knew?
better than being caught with your pants down , huh?
i'm john mcclane .
you're , uh ...
clay .
bill clay .
know how to use a handgun , bill?
i spent a weekend at a combat ranch .
that game with the guns that shoot red paint .
probably seems kind of stupid to you .
nope .
time for the real thing , bill .
all you got to do is pull the trigger .
come on .
put down the gun and give me my detonators .
well , well , well ...
hans .
put it down now .
that's pretty tricky with that accent .
you ought to be on fucking tv with that accent .
but what do you want with the detonators?
i already used all the explosives .
or did l?
i'm going to count to three .
yeah .
like you did with takagi?
oops .
no bullets .
what do you think ...
i'm fucking stupid , hans?
you were saying?
karl .
schieb dem fenster .
shoot the glass !
jesus christ !
smile , karl .
we're back in business .
.. is the last resort of diplomacy , then couldn't we just as well say that terrorism has an equal claim on being that , too?
tell me you got something .
mcclane's name , badge number , employment record , vital statistics , and his family's home address right here in la .
whoo !
go to work .
got it .
god , that man looks really pissed .
he's still alive .
what?
only john can drive somebody that crazy .
hans , you better heat up that miracle because we just broke through on number six and the electromagnetic came down like a fucking anvil .
have a look at what our friends outside are doing and i'll be right up .
hey , john .
john mcclane , you still with us?
yeah .
but all things being equal , i'd rather be in philadelphia .
chalk up two more bad guys .
the boys down here will be glad to hear that .
we gota pool going on you .
what kind of odds am i getting?
you don't want to know .
put me down for 20 .
i'm good for it .
hey , pal , you got flat feet?
what the hell are you talking about , man?
something had to get you off the street .
what's the matter?
you don't think jockeying papers across a desk is a noble effort for a cop?
no .
i had an accident .
the way you drive , i can see why .
what'd you do?
run over your captain's foot with the car?
i shot a kid .
he was 13 years old .
oh , it was dark .
i couldn't see him .
he had a ray gun , looked real enough .
when you're a rookie , they teach you everything about being a cop except how to live with a mistake .
anyway , i just couldn't bring myself to draw my gun on anybody again .
sorry , man .
hey , man , how could you know?
i feel like shit anyway .
well , then , this won't matter .
the lapd is not calling the shots down here any more .
the feds?
you got it .
those are the city engineers .
wait .
they're going into the street circuits .
those guys in the suits , i don't know who they are .
that's the fbl .
they're ordering the others to cut the building's power .
regular as clockwork .
or a time lock .
precisely .
the circuits that cannot be cut are cut automatically in response to a terrorist incident .
you asked for miracles , theo .
i give you the f b l .
i want the building shut down .
i got a problem .
i got a switch ...
i don't care about your switch .
i want it out .
dark !
you can't do it from here .
yeah , you could .
it can't be done from here .
i could just ...
i got the radio ...
you can't do it from here .
it's got to be done from downtown .
they've gotta take out a whole city grid .
we're talking 10 square blocks .
ten blocks?
johnson , that's crazy .
it's christmas eve .
there's thousands of people .
you have to go wider .
i need authorisation .
how about the united states government?
lose the grid , or you lose your job .
yeah , central?
yeah?
this is walt down at nakatomi .
would it be possible for you to turn off grid 212?
are you crazy? !
maybe i should call the mayor .
no shit it's my ass .
i got a big problem here .
shut it down now .
emergency lighting activated .
al , talk to me .
what's going on here?
ask the fbl .
they got the universal terrorist playbook and they're running it step by step .
it's gonna go .
it's gonna go !
yes !
merry christmas .
they must be pissing in their pants .
the mayor is gonna have my ass .
whoo !
what are we gonna do now?
arrest them for not paying their electric bill?
we've shut them down .
we let them sweat for a while , then we give them helicopters .
right up the ass .
this is agent johnson .
no , the other one .
i want that air support ready to lift off in five minutes .
damn right .
fully armed .
we're on the way .
oh , yes !
i wish to talk to the fbl .
this is special agent johnson .
the state department has arranged for the return of your comrades .
helicopters are en route as you requested .
i hear you .
we'll be ready .
by the time he figures out what hit him , he'll be in a body bag .
when they touch down , we'll blow the roof .
they'll spend a month sifting through the rubble .
by the time they figure out what went wrong , we'll be sitting on a beach earning 20 % .
ah !
jeez !
powell?
yo , powell , you got a minute?
i'm here , john .
listen , i'm starting to get a bad feeling up here .
i want you to do something for me .
um ... ahem ...
i want you to find my wife .
don't ask me how .
by then you'll know how .
uh , i want you to tell her something .
i want you to tell her that ...
tell her it took me a while to figure out what a jerk i've been but , um ... that ...
that when things started to pan out for her
i should have been more supportive .
and , uh ...
i just should have been behind her more .
oh , shit .
tell her that , um that she's the best thing that ever happened to a bum like me .
she's heard me say " i love you " a thousand times .
she never heard me say i'm sorry .
i want you to tell her that , al .
tell her that john said that he was sorry .
ok?
you got that , man?
yeah , i got it , john .
but you can tell her that yourself .
you just watch your ass and you'll make it out .
you hear me?
i guess that's up to the man upstairs .
john?
john?
what the fuck were you doing upstairs , hans?
john?
no , al , listen .

how nice to make your acquaintance .
on your feet , everyone !
to the roof !
lock them up there and come right back .

what do you figure the breakage?
i figure we take out the terrorists ,
lose 20 , 25 % of the hostages , tops .
i can live with that .
