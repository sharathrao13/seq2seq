good evening , mrs. gant .
what does my husband want now?
his plans changed .
he's available to spend time with michael .
michael just came home .
he's expecting his son , ma'am .
hello , it's vinn .
i need to speak to gant .
yeah?
robert , what are you doing?
he flew to europe .
five days later , you send him home?
come on , michael .
daddy's waiting .
he'll be fine .
bye , mommy .
robert , you bastard .
this wasn't our agreement .
unit 1 , do you copy?
let's go , michael !
come on with me .
take the flank .
got you .
okay , come on .
hang on to me , michael .
stay here , all right?
stay here and be brave .
jeremiah ecks?
no , sorry .
that's you , isn't it?
what happened to your head?
bad haircut .
look , we've been instructed to bring you in .
i'm not the man you want .
forget this .
we'll do it the hard way .
that's not a healthy attitude .
neither is yours .
relax , addis .
yeah , relax .
listen to your partner .
this guy's nothing .
who sent you?
fbi assistant director julio martin .
julio .
hello , ecks .
we need to talk .
the answer is no .
i'll need a car here at 3 : 00 .
no , make it 2 : 30 .
i don't want to get stuck in this holiday traffic .
vinn is alive .
you're lying .
taken off a cellular sweep .
i saw her die .
you saw an explosion .
i went to her funeral .
you saw a closed casket .
you waited seven years to tell me?
i'd have told you if i'd known .
where is she?
i don't know .
then why are you here?
i need you to do a job for me .
where is my wife?
i'm sorry .
i need you to do it ...
where is she?
when the job is done , i'll give you what i got .
no , you don't want to do this .
i don't have a choice .
i have a situation and you're my only option .
i tell you what i know right now , and you're gone .
i'm gone anyway .
sit in the corner .
you'll provoke him when he returns .
you'll be joining an fbi transnational special task force .
make it 2 : 30 .
i don't want to get stuck in this holiday traffic .
you were supposed to protect my son .
she took us by surprise .
how do i explain that to my wife?
in more noble times ... ... when a knight failed his king ... ... he fell on his sword .
sir?
do the honorable thing , agent curtis .
take the gun .
put it against your head .
pull the trigger .
now .
how much time do we have?
based on our tests , we have 28 hours left .
then my son dies .
do whatever it takes , ross .
get me michael .
you know who we're up against .
you know what she wants .
well , i can't give it to her , now can i?
on the left is a. j. ross .
his team arrived in vancouver five hours ago .
prince of darkness .
lf you know so much , just pick him up .
i don't want him .
i want the man he works for , robert gant .
robert gant?
intel is purposely limited .
but a shadow government ... ... in the name of national security is still a shadow government .
this is gant's latest acquisition .
code name " softkill .
he's been trying to build a perfect assassin .
but he's never been able to lick the one thing that got in his way .
the human factor .
for gant , emotions are a liability .
a machine would solve that problem .
he could give a head of state a heart attack or an aneurysm .
totally undetectable .
it's the future of his business .
looks like he licked the problem .
more like he stole it .
a prototype was developed at a facility in berlin .
last week , the place was torched .
the media called it an accident .
ross just happened to be there .
and the prototype?
we thermoscanned ross and his men before they boarded their plane .
all clean .
no sign of the prototype .
thank you , louise .
it all checked out until last night .
ecks , this is special agent harry lee .
we pulled that from a traffic cam .
this woman single handedly took out an armed dla escort detail ... ... and kidnapped a young boy .
gant's son .
based on ross being here , yes , we think so .
obviously a professional .
is she ours or theirs?
no idea .
my money pegs her as disaffected dla .
profiles , photos , anything?
just that .
if she's dla , she's orphan class , out of china .
orphan class?
one child per family .
all families want a boy .
the dla secretly adopts some of these girls .
they're weaned on violence .
trained to do nothing ... ... but kill in a thousand ways .
no fear .
no conscience .
no morality .
exactly what gant wants in an employee .
whoever she is , she's obviously pissed off at him .
that's why i need you to find her .
of course you do .
is that why they call you " x "?
i'm on a diet .
that's my wife and my daughter .
her name's mali .
do you love her?
of course .
then get out of this business .
gun team , disable target on my command .
don't cancel .
we need her alive .
acknowledge .
roger that .
affirmative .
is the target aware?
no , sir .
is her back to you?
affirmative .
positive visual .
we got her too .
freeze .
she's got a gun !
get down !
close one is not responding .
i've lost her .
too much motion .
you have her?
negative .
please advise .
call in the local p. d. we'll use them for cover .
target clear .
why is she standing there?
she knows you won't kill her .
pin her down !
the local p. d. has been alerted .
they're coming in .
move !
move !
gun team , do you see her?
negative .
do not let her breach the perimeter .
jesus !
do not cancel target .
keep her contained .
where's my tactical team?
run .
don't shoot !
sniper one , what are you waiting for?
disable target !
all units , shots fired .
suspect is female . vancouver library .
that's her .
julio?
we heard .
we're on it .
tracking target .
all right , let's move it !
get her !
we lost contact with our tactical unit .
who's manning the assault vehicle?
shit !
get out of here !
get down !
cover me !
cover me !
stay back please , sir .
you shouldn't be here .
somebody get too much foam in their latte?
i'm in no mood .
that makes two of us .
i know about that job you pulled in berlin .
you're getting sloppy .
enjoy your stay in vancouver .
who's the woman?
somebody your boss pushed too far?
stay out of this .
this is an issue of national security .
you mean job security?
wouldn't want to be you when gant sees this mess .
you're sweating .
it's been raining .
be smart .
walk away .
julio?
yeah .
take your people out of here .
what is it?
a feeling .
get them out .
now .
what the hell are you talking about?
she will retaliate .
we're covered .
a curtain call here would be suicide .
you're wrong .
how can you be sure?
trust me .
she's not done yet .
down !
get down !
julio !
she knows .
she knows where your wife is .
martin is down !
paramedic !
paramedic !
over here !
come on , baby .
come on .
yeah .
hey , beautiful !
what ...
my nose !
i think it's broken .
let me see .
where is she?
i didn't touch her .
mobile unit one on site .
situation out of hand .
suggest the locals take this one .
bitch .
head for the highest vantage point .
they're on foot .
they can't be hard to spot .
drop your weapon !
you kill me , you kill gant's son .
i don't work for gant .
i just want my wife .
shit !
i'm okay .
the bullet hit my vest .
ross , do you have my son yet?
we've sighted our target .
no word on the package .
we may have another problem .
where is my wife?
where is she?
what's your hurry?
chase one , we have your hot target locked .
our new player might do the job for us .
advise .
don't let them cancel each other .
roger that .
going green for a quarantine .
target's on the move , over north side of building .
it's not polite to stare .
i see you've met mali .
come here , sweetie .
how you doing?
what's up?
go find mom .
so my daughter wanted to know why you look so sad .
i told her it's because you just got beat up by a girl .
you know , ecks , martin didn't want to do it .
use your wife as bait to get you back in the game .
but he had no choice .
how is he?
not bad , considering .
bullet missed his heart by about a centimeter .
she doesn't miss .
what are you saying?
nothing .
could you give me a laptop ...
... and julio's notes on this case?
i thought you might say that .
let me see your hand .
who's running the task force now?
nobody .
we're suspended pending an inquiry .
which means i probably shouldn't watch you do this .
you're not even here .
right .
sever .
freeze !
get your hands above your head !
oh , man .
you're under arrest for the shooting of agent julio martin .
we have her online , sir .
put her through .
where's my son , sever?
maybe the same place my son is .
don't blame me .
you broke profile .
is that what you call having a child?
they weren't supposed to be there .
sever?
sever?
how's michael?
fine .
he's a good boy .
but he misses his mother .
i want him back .
you mean you want what he's carrying .
he could die if we don't get it out .
i didn't put it in him .
you did .
tell that to your wife .
what do you want?
your life for michael's .
it didn't have to come to this , sever .
well , now it has .
you pulled his file?
yes , sir .
here's the printout .
sever still has gant's kid .
i don't know what you're talking about .
you better pay attention because she won't stop until she gets him .
i can find her ... ... bring back the kid .
sever is dla .
she knows all your tricks .
she doesn't know mine .
we can handle this .
you're certainly doing a great job of it .
why do you care?
that's my business .
yes .
the local p. d. has our man .
id?
former fbi agent named jeremiah ecks .
get rid of him .
sorry , ecks , you're a local matter .
we're done here .
you're making a mistake .
she's gonna kill you .
captain , this isn't my jurisdiction ... ... but i suggest you take him away before i make it my jurisdiction .
good luck .
is he alive?
yes , i'm sure of it .
why do they want michael?
i don't know .
you're lying .
i swear .
do they want money?
i don't know .
this should have never happened .
michael should have been home with me .
i'm doing everything i can to find him .
what are you doing exactly?
you know i can't divulge details .
of course .
i'm sorry .
you promised me this wouldn't happen .
you think i haven't tried to keep that promise?
just find him .
mobile two has visual of target .
shit !
you wanted your wife?
you'll find her with gant .
we need to talk .
we're running out of options .
ecks is mobile .
sever helped him escape .
what the hell does she want with him?
can i ask why this man is so dangerous?
no .
what did you find out?
they're still looking .
you needed to lock yourself in the study for that?
you know how it works .
i'll take care of it .
why is this person trying to hurt us?
what did you do to him?
her .
she used to work for me .
oh , god .
god , no .
she won't hurt michael .
how can you be so sure?
trust me .
i need you to be strong .
then leave .
where are you going?
out .
how much time do we have?
less than 1 2 hours .
thank you .
hello , vinn .
jeremy?
what's going on , jeremy?
i am taking a deep cover assignment .
baby ... ... please don't take this one .
i wish i didn't have to .
then don't .
quit .
this is my job .
this is what i do .
why did this have to happen to us?
it's a means to an end .
gant had an agenda .
me , he had to get rid of , and you ...
well , you he wanted .
and so he took you .
i know , i know .
i'm late .
i know he loved me ... ... but i only became his wife ... ... in name .
you're the one that i love .
i never stopped loving you .
you had a son with him .
no .
not with him .
michael?
i knew that day in the restaurant .
i wanted to tell you .
i wanted you to stay , but i didn't want you to worry about me ... ... about us .
he's our son .
yours and mine .
he was the only piece of you i had left .
oh , god , no !
jeremy !
i thought that staying with gant ... ... was the only way to protect michael .
but i was wrong .
michael .
hey , listen to me .
i found you .
we'll find him .
what do we do now?
run .
is that the bitch who stole our son?
i see you found your wife .
where is michael?
your son?
yes , my son .
get in .
and by the way ... ... l'm the bitch protecting him .
air one to command , we have target in sight .
how do you know about michael?
prison bus .
i could have been killed .
but you weren't .
you do know we have company .
of course .
of course .
air one to command .
target's destination is the south end of victoria park .
he's up there .
michael?
mommy !
sweetie .
where were you , mom?
are you okay?
thank god .
i was so worried about you .
i missed you so much .
i missed you too , mommy .
i wasn't even scared .
you weren't?
who's that man?
come on .
hello .
i am jeremy .
you're michael , right?
go .
you'll be safer up there until this is over .
where do you get all this ordnance?
some women buy shoes .
sweet .
all teams are in position .
they move on my order .
what about your wife and son?
ecks will protect them .
and sever?
she's been mourning her family long enough .
let's reunite them .
sir , with all due respect , that's an unacceptable level of exposure .
let's see .
you lost my son .
you just lost my wife .
you think i've lost my mind too?
i didn't set this in play .
you did .
i warned you of the risks .
your job is to fix my messes .
it should never have gotten this far .
let's get this over with .
gant .
sever .
this doesn't have to get messy .
i just want you .
i make you the same offer .
send out what belongs to me .
then we can discuss your reinsertion .
it's a little late for that .
it's never too late .
tell that to vinn .
i can upgrade your status .
allow you the luxury of a family .
i had a family .
you know who we are , sever .
targets and objectives come first .
this is the way our world is .
they were innocent .
there are no innocent people .
you know that .
only killers and victims .
take her out .
yes , sir .
go .
my turn .
get down !
go .
move out !
go !
moving in !
go , go , go !
give me that .
let's finish this .
shit .
hello , jeremiah .
agent clark .
it's been a long time .
why?
come on .
you should know by now .
we had to get rid of agent clark ... ... so there could be a robert gant .
so you rise from the ashes with a license to do whatever you want .
power and profit .
it's what we do .
where are my wife and son?
last time i checked , they were not yours .
come on , jeremiah .
i'd hate for either of them to get hurt in the middle of this .
you're standing pretty close ... ... gant .
what if i decided to lift my foot right now?
i guarantee you won't walk away from this one .
run !
make sure he's dead .
yes , sir .
ross .
sever .
just like old times .
one big happy family .
right , sever?
hello , my love .
robert .
are you okay?
what do you want?
i've come for my family .
just stay away from us , okay?
why would i ever stay away from you?
are you okay , michael?
have you been taking care of mommy?
yes .
look at this .
look what i got for you .
what are you doing?
give me your hand .
robert , no .
gant .
you're still here .
he was about to do something to michael .
no .
it was never about michael .
of course it's about michael .
what are you talking about?
a piece of hardware gant wants .
he stole it in berlin .
used michael to carry it across the border .
you used my son?
you sick son of a bitch .
come here , michael .
it's okay .
give me your hand .
that's a good boy .
it's not here .
come here , sweetie .
where is it?
where is it?
ask her .
she's gonna kill you .
good luck .
all that training .
is that the best you can do?
no .
this is .
let's go , let's go .
move it .
get that fire knocked down !
they weren't kidding about you .
i can't take credit for this .
where's our mysterious killer?
she's not a killer .
then what is she?
a mother .
okay , then where is she?
thank you .
take care of your family .
i will .
