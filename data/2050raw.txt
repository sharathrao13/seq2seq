this motion picture is set over the mediterranean sea in an age when ... seaplanes ruled the waves .
it tells the story of a valiant pig who ... fought against flying pirates for his pride , for his lover , and for his fortune .
the name of the hero of our story is crimson pig . .
the crlmson plg
yeah?
porco rosso , get going .
mamma aiuto " is on the move .
mamma aiuto?
i don't need a cheap job .
a charter ship from venice was attacked .
they're stealing fuel from the ship .
is that all?
ah ...
well ...
some vacationing girl school children on are on board .
it's going to cost more than you think .
i'm going to apply clause three of the contract to this case .
and clause four , too .
stop !
stop , or we'll sink you !
stop !
we're gonna be kidnapped !
wow !
pirates !
sea pirates !
they're not sea pirates !
they're air pirates !
overdue for an overhaul .
are you bad guys?
yup .
are we hostages?
yeah .
you guys are called air pirates , aren't you?
you know a lot .
it's a skull .
neat , isn't it?
hurry up with the kids !
i'm busy .
do you want all 15 of them?
of course .
it's not nice for a girl to be left behind .
i'm too late .
the girls were kidnapped !
bring the girls back !
they went that way !
i know what they're thinking .
since they're poor and stingy , they'll want to save gas .
so , they'll change course for the nearest island as soon as they're out of sight .
crap !
dammit .
this is no good .
there they are !
what the heck is this?
a sightseeing plane around the islands .
look at that !
it's a pig .
what a cute pig .
you girls could be kidnapped here .
watch out , babes !
cool !
what a nuisance !
we are flying !
let me see , let me see !
hey , don't !
shut up , shut up .
please !
hey , do something , will you?
that's why i asked if we wanted to take all of them .
ok , just for a little while .
wow !
wonderful !
hey , look at that !
a red plane .
where?
where?
it's over there , right?
yeah .
that's as far as you go .
see , here he comes .
that's porco rosso !
hey , i can't see .
it stopped .
we're gonna fall .
not yet !
we have one more engine !
what the heck are you doing !?
shoot , shoot him , shoot him down !
wow !
what a cool red plane !
you missed him .
you're in my way .
morse code !
you lose .
listen to me .
shut up !
here !
he's coming !
get your heads down !
where , where is he?
he must be hiding .
wow !
cool !
we're sinking !
we're sinking !
we are not sinking .
this is a seaplane !
don't !
it's dangerous !
stop that .
they're very valuable hostages to us !
don't worry , mister .
we're all students at the swimming school .
oh , no .
no !
me , too .
another message from the pig !
i'm going to let you to take half of the gold coins .
but leave the rest of the coins and the hostages , behind !
if you don't , i'm going to kill you all !
that's what he says .
a half of the coins !?
shut your mouth !
come on , pig .
let's fight it out !
here we go !
it's broken .
we give up !
we give up !
good bye !
play with us again
good bye !
this is great .
we have enough money for repairs
you , idiot .
be more greedy !
quiet down .
quiet down , will you !?
don't touch that , you'll break it .
stay away from the propeller .
pee?
do it around there , please .
mamma aiuto's men said they couldn't come to see us .
damn !
how can a pig be such a hero?
that young fella is an american , isn't he?
if he is , that's a shame for the pilots of the adriatic .
oh , not at all .
his grandmother is quarter italian .
we should do something about the porco .
we have a great deal of trouble .
but , 10 % !
that's not fair .
when we will sing in the time of cherries
happy nightingales and mocking thrush
will all celebrate .
lovely ladies will be dreaming of follies
beautiful ...
and lovers will have sun in their heart .
when we will sing in the time of cherries .
the mocking thrush will trill much better .
but it is so short , the time of cherries
when we go together , pretending
to pick earrings .
cherries or love , both clothed alike ,
fall under the leaves , like drops of blood .
but it is so short , the time of cherries ,
coral pendants we picked while dreaming .
here he comes .
he stinks .
what a fake !
i will always love the time of cherries .
it is then that i hold a wound in my heart .
porco rosso !
i'm a reporter for the neptune .
you did another great job , again .
i think " mamma aiuto " isn't going to show up again for a while .
anyway , about your estimated bounty this year
they say it must be more than last year's ...
wait .
let go of me .
hey !
listen to a song in silence .
she's wonderful .
she is a wonderful lady .
madam gina of the hotel adriano ... ... is famous among the pilots throughout this country .
while she sings , even pirates and bounty hunters become good guys .
is that plane up front yours?
yeah , it's a plane of the rattle snake , bringing me fame and fortune .
that plane beat an italian at the schneider cup , twice .
not only is it fast , ...
it's also and excellent fighter .
i heard there's a little pig named porco rosso who's famous around here .
if you're dealing with the air pirates , watch your tail " cowboy .
they're misers , and are poor , too .
they stink , because they don't take showers .
i know that .
what?
come on , you little chicken !
may i help you , gentlemen?
what're you up to tonight?
you're up to no good , aren't you?
i'm glad you came , but don't play war games .
we know , gina .
we don't work within 50km of this establishment .
we're even getting along with that pig .
you're good boys .
see you later .
hey , what are you doing !?
porco , tell me the whole story .
next time we're alone .
that american is really funny .
as soon as he saw me , he proposed .
i've married three pilots ...
the first died in the war , ... the second died in atlantic ocean , ... and the last one died in asia .
you got the news?
i got it today .
it says the remains were found in the forests of bengal .
i've been waiting for three years .
my tears dried up long ago .
good guys always die .
for my friend .
marco , thank you for staying with me all these years .
you're the best friend .
the only thing i don't like is that you won't take that picture down .
don't break it , you promised me .
that's the only picture left of you as a human .
how can we break your curse?
that american is very talented .
i envy you .
i wish i could make money like you .
this is the payment for this month .
you've paid off the entire loan for the airplane .
let's see ...
how about buying some patriot bonds in devotion to our country?
i'll leave that to the " humans .
welcome , mr. porco rosso .
it's ready .
give me 60 rounds of ammo as well .
o. k.
the country's busy , isn't it?
oh , yeah .
the government is probably going to change .
if so , people like you will be outlaws .
country " and " law " don't mean anything to a pig .
you're right ,
the same goes for a mole .
is it ok , like usual?
we have a new supply of an incendiary bomb .
hey , kid .
i'm not going to war .
see you .
thanks for coming .
excuse me , boss .
could you tell me the difference between a soldier and a bounty hunter?
one's scum if he can't win in war .
the other's useless and stupid if he can't make a fortune .
who ever heard of an air pirate who was deep in debt?
we had nothing to barter with , captain .
we couldn't even afford paint .
there're ships up ahead !
crap .
why do i have to stay with such pathetic looking group?
it's due to the pig , the crimson pig .
take a look at that .
mama aiuto " don't even have money for paint .
sorry looking chumps .
well , we're all here .
hey , is the american around?
yeah , he's in the sun .
just like he told us .
target sighted !
it's the queen of mediterranean !
are we going to take on such a big ship?
that's why we prepared well .
don't be afraid !
i'm having engine trouble .
you go first .
you are cunning !
do as we agreed !
we share the cost of repairs when we loose , don't we?
you , stingy ...
of course we share them !
wait a minute ...
engine trouble ...
shut up !
knock it off !
attention please .
attention please .
air pirates are attacking this ship .
but there is nothing to worry about .
this ship has excellent fighters .
let me introduce the pilots .
no .
1 is the black stallion , signore bulkar .
no . 2 is the seawolf , visconti .
i didn't know they had fighter protection .
ah , ah , they're upset .
let's get out of here !
all right , wait there .
this engine's finally had it .
looks like i'll have to take it to milan .
... but they succeeded in escaping by parachute .
the air pirates , who took all the money and gold from the ship ...
you're next , pig !
come get it , pig !
i repeat that ...
you are next , pig .
come get it , pig !
this crime ...
you guys are special kind of trash .
i'm sorry , but i'm going on vacation .
white sheets ...
beautiful ladies ...
hang in there to milan , engine chan .
i don't like this weather .
i guess i'll have to go under the clouds .
be a good girl , hang in there .
you're a good girl , engine chan .
rosso !
fight me man to man .
i don't have time to play with you now .
don't run away , or i'm going to tell everybody about it .
see you later , american !
damn , i'm out of the clouds .
oh oh .
gotcha !
no , you didn't .
it's broken .
did it !
i'm going to be famous !
they won't believe me if i don't bring back any proof .
let's see ...
there !
this cheap , red piece ...
this is it .
this will be a nice gift for my mom in alabama .
please hurry .
madam !
madam ...
telephone . please .
he's still alive .
please use the phone at the front desk .
marco , is this you?
are you hurt?
i was about to leave to pick you up .
yes ...
that's great .
i lost some weight , because i was stranded on an island .
i'm going to milan to repair my plane .
if that american stops by your hotel , tell him ...
see you again next time .
what?
do you think i'm a bulletin board or something?
however much i'm worried about you guys ...
pilots like you regard women as nails in a landing pier or something insignificant .
marco , you're going to end up as roast pork someday .
i'd hate to witness such a miserable funeral .
a pig who doesn't fly is just an ordinary pig .
idiot .
i've been waiting for you ; i expected you tonight .
i need your help again .
you lost too much this time .
why don't you just build another one?
i want to keep this one .
i know how you feel .
step aside , please .
i need drive into the factory .
who's the cute girl?
my granddaughter , from america .
all right .
all right .
all right .
nice plane .
it's neat , grandpa .
good design .
these days there're almost no workers to do a job like this .
she doesn't resemble you .
is she really your granddaughter?
don't touch her !
fio , i leave this to you .
ok .
i'll do it .
my opponent is curtis .
i need 15 knots more .
curtis?
i've hear of him .
what do you think?
this is a hallvolley , isn't it .
don't ask how i got this .
an italian plane with this engine lost to curtis at the schneider's cup race in 1927 .
but it lost due to poor engineering , not this engine .
this is exciting .
don't tune it up too delicately .
my plane isn't for racing .
are you preaching to me?
do you know the saying , " preaching a sermon to buddha .?
are you going to take all of my money?
these days , wads of bills aren't worth a damn .
give me the money in your pocket , for propeller and paint ...
this is for living expenses , such as hotel and meals .
you can stay here .
i won't charge you much .
meals included .
i don't see your sons .
are they all right?
all three left to look for work .
then ... who is going to design my plane?
fio is .
fio !
that little girl i just saw?
she is young , but she's got something my sons lack .
look , old man , we've known each other for long time .
but i'll look for another repairman this time .
hold it .
are you worried because i'm a woman?
or , do you think i'm too young to do it?
both , miss .
ok .
i agree with you .
well , can you tell me the first priority of being a good pilot?
experience?
no , inspiration , i think .
well , i'm glad you didn't say " experience .
anyway , i heard from grandpa that you flew at an early age .
and you've been an excellent pilot since then .
that was 1910 , when i was 17 .
17 !
that's the same age i am now .
i can't quit being a woman ...
but let me do the job , will you?
if i don't do it well , don't pay me .
ok , grandpa?
she's my granddaughter , she'll do well .
in my case , i was able to fix engines at the age of 12 .
could you sleep here tonight?
i'll make your bed tomorrow .
breakfast's at 7 : 00am .
you can take a hot shower .
i've you left a towel already .
have a good night .
you don't have enough money .
we know each other well , so will make the rest a loan .
good morning .
did you sleep well?
did you stay up all night?
this is the rough plan .
what do you think?
i want to redesign this wing section , leaving the plane shape as it is .
this will make your plane fly faster .
five knots faster , i think .
i'm surprised at the original plan .
the wing was also made of wood .
this plane is great .
whoever designed this wing must have known the wood very well .
i'm really impressed .
this is the only plane of its kind made .
the designer said this plane was too dangerous to fly .
so nobody used it .
no wonder !
i'm surprised that this radical design lets you to take off from water .
only take offs and landings give me some difficulty .
it behaves strange during the flight .
there's a 5 degree angle to the wings here , right?
everything should be fine then .
you'll let me continue with this , then?
thank you .
i'll do my best !
but let me tell you something , miss .
don't stay up all night .
you can't do a good job without sleep .
and it is not good for your beauty .
thank you for your advice .
well , to be honest , i couldn't sleep well last night , ... because i was very nervous .
i was worried that you won't let me do this job .
well , i'm very sleepy now .
i'll make some coffee for you .
is she going to build this plane by herself?
next is my niece , monica , in charge of general construction .
nice to meet you .
this is my nephew's wife , silvana , to do finishing construction .
these are daughters of my relatives .
sophia , laura , constance , valentina .
this is fio's elder sister , giliora .
this is sandra , my cousin .
you look so pretty , marietta .
maria , tina , anna , and her younger sister , birreta .
angelino !
grandma !
are you still alive?
you've grown up to be such a nice boy !
are you ladies going to work?
yes , i'd like to have some money for my great grandchildren .
there are no men here , right?
yup .
these are all relatives of yours?
yes , they don't have any jobs these days .
all the men went elsewhere to work .
because of the " great depression?
don't worry .
girls are nice , they work hand , and they're also gutsy .
building an airplane isn't like cooking pancakes .
dear god in heaven ...
you gave my company , which was about to go bankrupt , ... a piece of bread and a job .
please forgive us , who make a fighter plane with ladies .
well , let's eat well and work hard !
sounds good !
this engine is really something !
what do you say , it's nice , isn't it?
don't over do it , or this factory will be gone .
you don't think curtis is worth it?
sure , this is a good idea .
so , let me do it .
but , this is going to cost a fortune .
i got a lot of bills already .
i'm not sure what the sponsor thinks .
porco ...
ok .
don't look at me like that .
do it your way .
all right !
i've already talked to manufacturers .
i'll order these immediately .
porco , i love you !
it's going to take at least 3 months .
i want to change my job and become an air pirate .
she is a nice girl , isn't she .
don't touch her .
i wouldn't be happy being henpecked .
so , you're a major?
you've moved up in the world , fierrali .
you , fool .
why did you come back?
i make it a rule to go wherever i want to .
the government won't let you go this time .
were you followed?
i gave them the slip .
they'll issue a warrant for your arrest . anti fascism ... illegal entries ... corrupt ideology ... being a shameless , lazy pig , ... and public indecency .
idiot , this is no laughing matter .
they say they'll confiscate your plane .
this movie is crap , don't you think .
look , marco , come back to the air force .
i would make room for you .
i'd rather be a pig than a fascist .
the era of sky adventures is over .
the only thing left for us to do is to fly for such ridiculous reasons as the " country .
i've lived my life my way , without relying on force .
you are a pig after all , huh?
thanks for your advice , fierrali .
give my regards to the others .
this is a nice film , don't you think .
take care .
they don't sue pigs , but ...
yeah .
goodbye , my comrade .
porco , need a ride?
hey , you're a life saver .
i borrowed this to take your plane to the lake tomorrow .
it's for a test flight .
i don't need the test flight .
i need to fly as soon as possible .
don't be stupid .
i'm not going to give you the plane without testing it .
besides , it will take almost a day to take it apart and transport it to the lake .
we don't have that much time .
take a look back , will you , ... slowly .
that's the fascists 'secret police .
they were following you , fio .
me?
why?
because i gave them the slip .
and , because you are working on my plane .
hey , porco , are you really a spy?
me?
a spy?
look , a spy works a lot harder than i do .
but , you were a hero in the war .
this is strange if you didn't do anything .
i think so , too .
this isn't the right way !
looks like you're used to being in big trouble .
well , we'll be very busy .
you can take off anytime you want .
two guys are hiding in the backyard , ... and three in the front .
this is so exciting !
hey , grandma , don't ramble .
see you later .
take care of yourself .
thank you .
fio !
what are you doing?
i'm going , too .
hang on 5 minutes while i prepare my seat .
quit fooling around .
do you understand what you are saying?
shh ...
don't talk so loud .
fio .
listen .
you're the daughter of a decent man .
besides , you're not married yet .
then ...
hold this for a moment .
thanks .
i made this in a hurry .
see?
this really fits .
would you hold that?
look , miss .
i'm a bounty hunter wanted by the government .
i'm not going to be playing with this plane .
i'm sorry , but i have responsibility for this plane .
but , i'm going to take off from the canal out back .
and i'm not even sure if it can fly .
all the more reason i should go with you .
and , if you're going to fight curtis ... you'll need a good mechanic , won't you?
look , i'm a man , you know .
we're going to be camping alone on a deserted island .
i don't care , i like camping .
that's not what i meant .
take her with you .
i want you to beat curtis so you can repay the loan .
my company may go bankrupt if you don't pay it .
are you really her grandfather?
you don't have to pay her .
plus , i'm going to install this phone for you two .
you really want her to be wanted by the police?
no .
i'm going to be porco's hostage .
that way they can excuse their cooperation with you .
so , please , take me with you .
i won't give you any trouble .
take off the machine gun on the right side .
what?
there's almost no space , even if you've got a small butt .
take off one machine gun !
great !
my butt is bigger then it looks .
it will be just take a minute .
i want to take off as soon as possible .
before the old ladies say they want to come with me too .
oh , that's a nice idea .
grandma , come on , hurry .
fio .
you don't have get me a souvenir .
contact .
open the door !
let it go !
how is the steering , porco?
kind of like a tomboy , just like you .
it's beginning to go wild .
stop the plane at once !
we'll make adjustments !
we don't have the time to do it .
just do your job .
ship dead ahead !
let's fly !
easy , tomboy !
the turning wing is shifting to the right .
use the tab !
the tab?
the new one i put in !
hurry !
good .
it became a nice boy all of a sudden .
beautiful .
the world's really beautiful .
is he following us?
no .
he's not attacking .
that's a parade plane of the italian air force .
looks like it's fierrali ...
do you know him?
the air force lies in wait up ahead .
he says he'll show us how to avoid them .
he also says that we should fly low to the adriatic sea .
thanks , comrade !
thanks !
he told you , " don't cast pearls before a swine .
you're lovely .
you look like a rose blooming in a secret flower garden .
you , bastard !
this is private garden .
i really want you to look at this .
oh , this is from hollywood .
about the production of the story and casting you sent ,
please contact us as soon as possible ; we are in the middle of preliminary trials .
the title is , " a bouquet of the adriatic sea .
that's nice .
really?
that means o. k. , then?
gina , come to hollywood with me .
i only worked for the pirates to gain fame and fortune .
next , i want to be a hollywood star .
and , then?
the president !
i'm serious .
i promise to make you the first lady .
gina .
i like you for such foolishness .
really !?
but i must say no , because i already have a gamble going .
when i'm in this garden , if he comes over here , ...
i will love him .
but he comes only to the restaurant at night .
and never emerges in the daylight .
he's come back .
fool .
he left without landing the plane .
i lost the gamble again .
you're kidding !
the gamble is about him?
is that a problem?
life is more complicated here than in your country .
here i can fall in love anytime i want .
kid , go to hollywood by yourself , ok?
kid ...?
i hit my head because you did an acrobatic maneuver all of a sudden .
i just said hello to my friend .
to gina of the hotel adriano?
that was her in the white dress on the hotel terrace , wasn't it?
my grandpa told me that every pilot in the adriatic sea falls in love with gina .
you speculate a lot .
so , what's the lady like?
you fell in love with her too , didn't you , porco?
we're going down to refuel .
close your mouth , or you'll bite your tongue .
w wait !
a girl on a fighter?
where's porco?
he is talking with my dad .
not only the temporary government ... but also the royalist faction ...
they've tried to get along with the air pirates .
fighting against the air pirates is not a thing to do .
here you are .
thanks .
no thanks for such bad news .
what?
you should offer yourself to one side or the other .
they'll pay a fortune for your skill .
you got a cigarette?
curtis will go back to america sooner or later .
we're the ones who should to go to america .
goodbye to freedom in the adriatic sea .
is that byron?
no , it's me .
see you later .
later .
porco , this is awful .
the gas price is three times as much as in italy .
we're not in luck .
don't be like a businessman , make it cheaper .
this gas is genuine .
that's why i hate women .
hey , would you explain it to her ...
pay him , fio .
then put your big butt back in the space between the machine guns .
we're going to fly to my home .
i'll add the gas bill to your account .
nobody can live alone .
we rely on each other .
nobody lives around here , ... even though the landscape is beautiful .
here we are .
that island is my home .
beautiful !
what a wonderful place .
my legs are stiff from the long flight .
don't move !
they're stinking up the place again .
boss , we caught him !
boss !
damn !
don't step on me ...
back off !
i was waiting for you , pig !
i knew you'd be coming here .
you gave us a lot of trouble .
it's a girl .
the pig is with a girl .
she's cute .
shut up !
so what if it's a girl?
about a half of the world's population are women !
hey , that's no ordinary girl .
she is a chief engineer at the piccolo company .
but , she's so young and pretty .
that girl?
really?
she made my plane much better then before .
she may be young , ... but she's really something .
you mean it , porco?
you're good with airplanes in general .
be polite , boys .
she came with me to collect my debts .
you're deep in debt after all .
it serves you right !
hey !
let's break his poor red plane , and leave him his debt !
break?
are you going to break the plane i made?
are you going to break such beautiful airplane with axes?
miss , there's a complicated reason behind this .
you are going to break it !
well , that is ...
are you guys really seaplane pilots?
would you step back?
my shoes .
i've grown up with a lot of stories about pilots since i was a small child .
my grandpa always told me that no one is as nice as sea pilots .
grandpa said it's because sea and sky purify their hearts .
hence , sea pilots are much braver then sailors , ... and prouder than the ordinary pilots .
don't tell me .
i know that .
they're the pilots .
what they value most , he said , is neither money nor women , ... but honor .
yes , you're right !
yes , lady !
a toast to the sea pilots !
she's really something .
i understand .
i won't smash the plane you made with axes .
but we'll be mortified if we don't do anything .
let's lynch the pig !
yeah !
lynch the pig !
what the hell you talking about?
you guys don't understand a word i said .
i asked whether you feel ashamed or not .
aren't you ashamed that you need the help of that american , curtis?
if your mother heard of that , she would cry .
what the hell are you saying , you don't even take a shower .
porco came back to fight curtis , ... for the pride and honor of the pilots of the adriatic .
you guys are lowest of the low !
fight with dignity !
i told you not to hire curtis , eh !
that's not fair .
don't try to excuse yourself .
boss , what are we supposed to do?
she convinced us .
how about asking curtis to fight the pig?
do we ask him to fight the pig , again?
the contract is already over .
i'm so ashamed ...
that's curtis !
i heard that .
i'm not going to run away !
you guys are crazy , coming down here like that .
hey , hold this .
you want a re match , don't you .
but i won once , already .
besides , i'm not a bounty hunter for these guys anymore .
you mean you won't fight for nothing?
what's your proposition?
beautiful !
will you marry me if i win?
i'm serious .
o. k. and if porco wins , you'll pay these bills .
wait , fio !
stay out of this !
fio , you still have time to think about that .
ask him , not me .
this is very expensive .
it's very cheap .
are you going to fight or not?
i'm willing to fight for love .
all right !
listen up everybody .
i'm really impressed with miss fio's decision .
we , " mamma aiuto " , are going to sponsor fight !
let the air pirates union do this , too !
fio !
see you soon !
this stinks !
hey pig , don't run away !
shut up !
get lost !
bye !
this is ridiculous .
well , you are ...
don't tell me .
i know , i was foolish .
fio ...
i think i have to thank you .
you gave me my chance .
thanks .
we share the same luck .
we are partners , aren't we?
we are going to have a hard time .
i trust you , porco .
trust me , eh?
i haven't heard that in a long time , but i'm glad you said that .
what's wrong?
you feel sick?
fio ...
i'm fine .
it's just that my heart is pounding .
my knees are shaking .
to be honest , i was really scared .
i want to swim .
porco !
i made a big mistake !
what's wrong?
i should have padded the deal .
we made a bad bargain .
you're right .
porco ....
having trouble sleeping?
just now ...
it must have been a dream .
everything is all right .
it's too early to get up .
porco ...
why did you become a pig?
don't know .
i've heard a lot about captain marco pabatto .
my father used to be in the same unit .
i've heard many a story , ... about how the captain saved the live of enemy pilots .
i liked it .
porco !
how about if i kiss you?
you know , like a fairy tale where a princess breaks a curse on a prince who was changed into a frog .
silly girl .
save it for your first love !
won't my kiss work?
you're a nice kid .
you make me feel comfortable and make me wish i was a human being again .
now be a nice girl and go to sleep .
tell me your story and i will .
my story?
well ...
it was the last summer of the war .
we were flying on our usual patrol , ... heading over the adriatic sea to istria .
belneldi was flying on my right wing .
he was an old friend of mine .
he got married just two days before .
i was the matchmaker .
he didn't have enough leave to be with his wife for long .
so , he returned to duty .
everyone was falling like flies , friend and foe alike .
i was being chased by three planes , ... and had no time to worry about my friend .
in the end , i was the only one left from my unit .
but , they never gave up chasing me .
i made desperate efforts to run away .
my hands and feet went numb , and i grew dizzy .
i thought i was going to die .
that was when i saw the white sky .
white sky?
yeah .
it was like a flash .
it was so bright , it took me a while to realize that i was in a cloud .
i was worn out , ... and didn't have any power left to control my plane .
in spite of that , ... my plane continued to fly .
a cloud of planes ...
yeah
it was calm .
the sky was very clear , too clear .
there was a line of clouds far above me .
belneldi , you're alive?
belneldi , wait !
where are you going?
belneldi , don't go !
are you going to leave gina alone?
i'll go instead of you !
when i came to , ...
i was flying alone over the sea , almost touching it .
god said it wasn't your time yet , didn't he?
in my mind , i thought he might let me fly like that forever .
that would not have been right !
you're a good guy !
the good guys are all dead already .
besides , that might have been hell inside that cloud .
well , that's the end of my story .
now go to sleep .
shit , they gave me crap ...
i'm glad you came back to live , ... because i like you .
good night !
hey , hey , ...
which one's gonna win ... a pig ...
place yer ...
fools .
they make our fight into a festival .
are they all air pirates?
the scum of the mediterranean ... gangs , ... pirates , smugglers , ... spies , ... and even a few ordinary people .
this'll make me even more famous .
ten minutes'til start .
ten minutes'til start .
all right !
this is a fight between porco rosso and donald curtis !
there are no special rules , ... but any unfair tricks will be a disgrace to their fans .
shut up and get started .
get on with it .
shut up !
or i'll kill you all !
he'd be better off dropping a 10 ton bomb .
this fight will determine the future of miss fio piccolo .
so shut up .
do you understand?
now let's have some applause !
clap !
let's get going .
shut up
this is a formality .
well , both of you present your stakes .
have a seat .
thanks .
put it on the chair properly !
none of you have anything to say?
well shake hands or something before you start !
no way .
i'm fond of cleanliness .
he's hard to please .
fio , as soon as this fight is over , we will go to the church .
don't worry .
my mom told me you're going to like me soon .
may i take a picture with you?
everybody , smile !
smlle !
yes .
the flight'll be over in 3 minutes .
the black plane has the advantage ...
the black plane has the advantage ...
this is great .
i wish they'd do this every month
15 seconds to go .
they're so cool ...
flve seconds .

curtis took over !
this is going to be a one sided fight .
give me that .
porco , what are you doing?
pull up !
he'd be shot if the climbed now .
it's very difficult for curtis to shoot porco in this situation .
i know you want me to waste ammo .
looping !
the pig took curtis 'back !
looping?
that skill made the pig the ace of the adriatic sea .
dammit !
he's gonna shoot !
why doesn't he open fire?
is his machine gun broken !?
i got it .
the pig won't shoot until the end .
what?
the pig doesn't kill anybody .
for now , the american should be fine .
you got it !
shoot !
oh , he didn't shoot yet ....
see , i told you .
if the pig opened fire , it would kill the american .
so , he's going to hit curtis 'engine with a few bullets after curtis gets tired .
he said this is not war , but ...
porco ...
are you teasing me or what?
come on !
is your machine gun broken?
you poor bastard !
they are coming this way !
you're teasing me .
come on , pig !
go away !
fight somewhere else !
great !
the pig is leaving a cloud trail .
i've never seen such an air fight before .
i'm really impressed .
i'm ready for takeoff .
she'd better hurry , or the fight will be over .
she's in her room , and won't come out .
does she want to go or not?
i want to see that fight myself ...
to g of hearts , for the pig .
the air force found out about the fight .
stop the silly fight .
f?
must be from fierrali .
i'd better hurry .
both of them are very tough .
the show isn't over yet !
porco , hang in there !
i'm not going to give fio to a man like you .
o. k. the pig took curtis's tail .
it's all over !
ooops .
jammed?
you're finished .
ooops .
jammed , too .
you idiot !
you're finally out of ammo !
this is broken because of fio's butt .
i'm not going to let this fight end in a draw .
this isn't a western .
you can't hit me .
you ...
you really think it will reach this far?
you , stinking pig !
looks like something's wrong .
ah ... they're coming in .
they're coming back !
wait !
the stakes can't leave here .
o. k. wait , you guys .
you fat pig !
you chicken cowboy !
come on , bare hands !
go back to the cows !
porco , hold on !
stand up , pig .
go , go !
all bets still stand !
where's the betting table?
can't you fly any faster?
it's impossible .
the engine would blow .
pilots are all stupid , aren't they ...
hey , fio .
did you see my punch?
i'm gonna take him down next round .
i'll take you down this time .
porco , hang on !
i'll make prosciutto out of you !
come on , you chicken !
you are the chicken !
you seduce all women around you .
choose gina or fio , one or the other .
what?
you can't have both .
gina is ...
gina?
leave gina out of this !
gina loves you , pig .
she is ... ... waiting for you ... ... in the garden !
porco !
the gong !
count him out !
but ...
look at that !
i can see it .
the italian air force hasn't arrived yet .
you are unfair ...
you're a dirty liar .
don't you understand , you idiot .
i'm not lying ...
i won't give fio to you .
that's gina's plane .
it's an emergency signal .
the winner is whoever stands up first .
everybody , let me through .
gina , don't .
marco .
marco , can you hear me?
do you want another girl to be unhappy?
porco !
porco !
porco , thank you !
nothing to it .
this party is over .
the italian air force will be here any minute .
everybody get out of here quickly , please .
then stop by my restaurant .
i will serve you all .
everybody , let's go !
it's all over .
hey , boss , come on !
hurry up !
shut up !
this is the ceremony .
i don't like the pig , but i like you .
be a nice lady engineer .
goodbye !
thank you .
take a shower sometime , will you?
thank you , too , mr. curtis .
next time i'll propose to you formally , not as a bet .
o. k.
but i've made up my mind already .
you're getting on gina's plane .
no !
no !
no .
i'm going on porco's plane .
you said i'm your partner , didn't you .
gina .
take her home , please .
you always do this .
i'm sorry .
you better go .
let's go .
the italian air force is finally here .
do you want to help me?
i'm going to lead them off .
your face !
wait !
hey !
let me see your face !
that's your plane is over there .
just a peek !
after the flight from the italian air force , ...
i returned to milan .
i haven't seen porco since .
instead , i've found a very good friend in miss gina .
since the day of the fight , there have been many wars .
but i still keep in touch with gina .
after i took over the piccolo factory ,
i make it a rule to spend summer vacations at the hotel adriano .
miss gina has become more beautiful each year .
old friends still stop by the hotel all the time .
oh , yeah , ...
although he is not the president of the u. s. yet , ...
mr. curtis writes to me sometimes .
he says he longs for the summer of the adriatic sea .
it's a secret between me and gina that she won her gamble .
directed by ......
hayao miyazaki
