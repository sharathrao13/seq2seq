arthur !
resistance is useless !
bring her to vogsphere for processing , captain .
where's the circus?
they got her and it's my fault .
we have to go !
let's go !
whoo !

trillian .
they've got trillian , you stupid half brained git !
right , you're coming out !
computer , we don't want to go to magrathea , we want to follow the ships .
i'd love to , but my guidance system has been deactivated .
oh , come on !
i'm sorry .
it wasn't my fault .
what you doing on this ship?
ford?
marvin .
i've been talking to the ship's computer .
and?
it hates me .
no , uh uh .
eddie , computer , is there another way to follow the ships?
activating emergency escape pod .
it's super neat and fun to fly !
ow !
unbelievable !
i'm in .
i'm in .
okay , ford , do you have any idea?
we'll press this .
oh , no , no , no , no .
this button .
okay .
nothing's ...

good man , good man , good man .
okay , we're wobbling ...
you forgot your towel .

is that better?
no , that's worse , that's worse .
do what ...
i don't need that .
okay .
stop the rocking .
marvin , any ideas?
i have a million ideas .
they all point to certain death .
thanks , marv .
ooh , ooh .
eee .
ooh , ooh .
whoo !
whee !
whee !
yeah !
yeah !
magrathea !
no , we're on the vogon planet .
yes , it is .
it's magrathea !
this is vogsphere .
yeah , magrathea .
i know it .
no , it's not .
there is no magrathea .
yes , it is .
what are you doing?
they took my head .
they have these on arcturan megafreighters .
they use them when they need to concentrate .
what is it?
it's a thinking cap .
there you go .
should give him some zest for about ten minutes or so .
now i'm feeling much better about our predicament .
i checked the guide for how to rescue a prisoner from vogsphere .
it said don't .
i'm assuming you have a better plan .
well , i kind of had this idea that we could ...
ow !
did anyone see that?
see what?
what was it?
uh ...
nothing , it's , uh , nothing .
it's just my imagination .
okay , right .
now , everyone just stop a minute , please , and look at me .
there's ... definitely something going on here .
just ... just watch .
just watch .
okay , i think we ...
oooh !
ah ha !
you too !
yeah , what was that?
i thi ...
zaphod , what do you think?
i think ...
ow !
zarquon !
what was that?
jeez !
i'd make a suggestion , but you wouldn't listen .
no one ever does .
i have an idea .
ooh , ooh , ooh , ford !
kill it !
get rid of it !
okay , don't think .
nobody think .
no ideas .
no theories .
no nothing .
ow !
this is crazy .
trillian is in there somewhere .
we need an idea to save her .
i have an ide ...
ah !
run !
yeeaaghh !
ooh !
ah !
you're supposed to stop .
okay , so i'm not thinking .
not thinking .
no ideas coming .
okay , this isn't an idea that has any merit at all , but , marvin , can you give me a hand?
okay , where is she? !
who , the director of robot arm repair?
tricia yggarstuk mcmillanus of ...
blaard?
no , tricia marie mcmillan of earth .
oh .
right .
sorry , no record of earth .
galactic sector zz9 plural z alpha?
oh , yes .
she's lying .
she's skinny , and she's pretty , and she's lying .
mmmm .
here we are .
earth .
oh .
um , " destroyed .
um , do you have a second home planet?
destroyed?
that's impossible .
that's what it says here .
says it was destroyed to make way for a hyperspace expressway .
who in their right mind gives an order to destroy a planet?
he said the gray building , right?
all the buildings are gray .
give me a hand . " ha ha , very funny .
how am i supposed to drive this pod with one arm?
stupid human .
go and fill that in .
then , make sure , when you fill in the facilitating form ...
leave this to me .
i'm british .
i know how to queue .
if you'd fill that form in for me , and return it as soon as possible .
writing implements to your left ...
you're president .
can you do anything?
presidents don't have power .
their job is to draw attention away from it .
hey , how you doin '?
hey , it's me , your president !
what's goin 'on?
thanks for coming .
all right .
i know that sponge .
all right !
next !
president coming through .
how you doin ', pinhead?
no , really , it's me .
i love kabuki .
look at that .
out the way .
give us a kiss !
hi , i've come about release of a prisoner .
prisoner release form .
oh , wha ...?
i don't believe you .
these are the orders .
love and kisses "? !
mm .
now , according to the galactic penal code , the punishment for a presidential kidnapping is to be fed to the ravenous bugblatter beast of traal .
good day .
ow , get off of me !
ow !
what the hell is that?
ow , no , wait , wait !
there's been some kind of mistake .
ah !
tick all the boxes on the right .
right .
got it .
not that one !
what to do if you find yourself stuck with no hope of rescue .
consider how lucky you are that life has been good to you so far .
alternatively , if life hasn't been good to you so far , which , given your current circumstances seems more likely , consider how lucky you are that it won't be troubling you much longer .
right , there we go .
oh , kidnapping the president .
oh , no , she's not eligible for release at this time .
okay .
right .
look , this is the president .
oh !
okay .
see , there?
he says the kidnapping business was a horrible misunderstanding .
oh , yeah .
she meant nothing by it .
he's ordering you to let her go .
but this isn't a presidential release of prisoner form .
those are blue .
i'll stay here .
all right .
hold that .
okay .
wai ...
oh , he's hungry today .
that's blue .
right .
i'm not a journalist .
we're just hanging out .
okay , this is , uh , it's for tricia mcmillan .
tricia mcmillan .
mm .
okay .
sir , it's a release form .
thank you .
she's free to go .
release her .
zaphod's here .
well , then , uh , that's fine then .
let's just go and get him .
who are we waiting for again?
no , i'm serious .
tricia !
tricia .
trill .
hey , come on .
you idiot !
you signed the order to destroy earth .
he did?
i did?
yes .
love and kisses , zaphod "?
you didn't even read it , did you?
honey , i'm president of the galaxy .
i don't get a lot of time for reading .
an entire planet , my home , destroyed because you thought they wanted your autograph .
they framed me !
are you an idiot?
trillian .
you knew .
why didn't you tell me?
he threatened me .
get a backbone , arthur .
oh , a backbone?
what about coming here to rescue you?
thank you .
my idea .
oh !
stupid !
got your arm .
how considerate .
right , then , all those lucky enough to have two arms , hold tight .
oh , the president tests my patience .
this time i shall pursue him myself .
ready my ship .
fantastic .
at last .
oh .
that's one hour for lunch , everybody .
i think i'll have soup today .
the encyclopedia galactica , in its chapter on love , states that it is far too complicated to define .
the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy has this to say on love .
avoid , if at all possible .
unfortunately , arthur dent has never read
the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy .
oh , i'm so sorry .
no , come in .
i ...
i didn't ...
um , look , uh ...
trillian , i just wanted to say , you were right ,
i should've told you , and i understand totally if you're angry with me .
um , for what it's worth , i know how you must be feeling ...
can you hand me a towel?
yeah , sure , this ...
thank you .
actually , what i was going to say was ... ... if i'd said yes to you and gone to madagascar , then neither of us would be here now .
i just thought that might count for something .
it doesn't matter .
all right , computer , take us to ...
where are we ...
where we headed again?
okay , i'm gonna get you another lemon .
all right .
engaging improbability drive .
no , zaphod , no .
buttons are not toys .
what did you do?
magrathean coordinates accepted .
it blows my circuits to tell you that we're in orbit , at an altitude of 300 miles , around the legendary planet of magrathea .
magrathea !
magrathea !
magrathea !
unbelievable .
it's even worse than i thought it would be .
greetings .
this is a recorded announcement as we are all out .
the commercial council of magrathea thanks you for your visit , but regrets that the entire planet is temporarily closed .
if you'd like to leave your name and a planet where you can be contacted , kindly do so at the tone .
how can a planet be closed?
zarkin 'a , cousin .
okay , computer , keep going .
take us down .
i'd be happy to .
it is gratifying that your enthusiasm for our planet continues unabated .
as a token of our appreciation , we hope you will enjoy the two thermo nuclear missiles we've just sent to converge with your craft .
to ensure on going quality of service , your death may be monitored for training purposes .
thank you .
i'm delighted to tell you there are two nuclear missiles heading right for us .
if you don't mind , i'm going to take evasive action .
something's jamming my guidance system .
impact minus 45 seconds .
computer , do something !
sure .
handing over manual control .
good luck .
i need some help .
i can't do this without my third arm .
arthur , grab my hand !
did we lose 'em?
no , they're coming right at us .
why don't i just press this?
no , we're not back to normal yet .
what will happen?
i don't know .
don't do it !
we're here .
no telling where it'll send us .
sod it all .
no !
wow .
where are we?
exactly where we were .
and the missiles?
apparently , they've turned ... into a bowl of petunias .
and a very surprised looking whale .
and an improbability factor of 8, 767, 128 to 1 against .
we have norm ... normality .
normality , right .
we can talk about normality till the cows come home .
what is normal?
what's home?
what are cows?
a proper cup of tea would restore my normality .
it is important to note that suddenly , and against all probability , a sperm whale had been called into existence several miles above the surface of an alien planet .
since this is not a tenable position for a whale , this innocent creature had very little time to come to terms with its identity .
ah , whoa , what's happening?
who am i?
why am i here?
what's my purpose?
what do i mean by who am i?
okay , okay , calm down , get a grip now .
ooh , this is an interesting sensation .
a sort of tingling in my ...
i better start finding names for things .
let's call it a tail .
yeah , tail .
what's this roaring sound whooshing past what i'm gonna call my head?
wind .
is that a good name?
that'll do .
yay , this is really exciting .
i'm dizzy with anticipation .
or is it the wind?
there's a lot of that now .
and what's this thing coming towards me very fast?
so big and flat and round .
it needs a big wide sounding name like ow , ound , round , ground !
that's it , ground .
i wonder if it will be friends with me .
hello , ground .
the only thing that went through the mind of the bowl of petunias as it fell was , " oh , no , not again !
many have speculated that if we knew why the petunias had thought that , we should know a lot more about the nature of the universe than we do now .
what are those things?
they're portals to another dimension .
right .
i don't suppose this portal has central heating , does it?
ah , this is the one .
this will all end in tears , i just know it .
right here .
hey !
whoa !
okay , in we go !
we can't just step into that ... that !
we don't know where it leads .
if we pick the wrong one , we just ... we come back , we pick another one .
it's no biggie .
what?
yeah , it's a big biggie , ford .
a big biggie .
what if it rips us all into tiny little atomic particle thingies?
this is the right one .
i have a hunch .
ford !
his hunches are good .
arthur , i say we go .
go with the hunch of a man whose brain is fuelled by lemons? !
this is suicide !
i think i resent that .
i don't care .
i'm getting hostility from you , alex ...
arthur !
have you ever tried yoga?
trillian !
i think that's supposed to happen .
she's gone !
ford , she's gone !
arthur , don't panic !
ford !
hey , wait for me !
whoo !
come on .
idiot !
come on , come on , come on , come on !
ahhh !
no , no , no , don't leave .
come on , come on , just start !
i told you this would end in tears .
did you?
did you?
geronimo !
ooomph !
far out !
far out !
ha ha !
this is it .
this is it !
deep thought .
i'm a coming .
so , this is how it's all going to end , is it?
me , alone on a dead planet , with a manically depressed robot .
you think you've got problems .
what if you are a manically depressed robot?
excuse me .
aaaaagghhh !
whoa , whoa .
who are you?
no , uh , my name is not important .
uh , you must come with me .
get away .
terrible events are afoot .
um , you ... you must come or you'll be late .
late?
what for?
what?
no , no .
what's ... what's your name , earthman?
dent .
arthur dent .
well ...
iate as in " the late dentarthurdent .
it's a sort of threat , do you see?
no .
no .
your friends are safe .
you can trust me .
a man who won't tell me his name?
okay , my name is , um ... ... my name is ... is ... is ...
slartibartfast .
i ...
i ...
i said it wasn't important .
well ... so my friends are safe?
let me show you .
i could calculate your chances of survival , but you won't like it .
did you know we built planets?
oh , yes , fascinating trade .
doing the , um ... doing the coastlines was always my favorite .
we used to have endless fun doing the little fiddly bits around the fjords .
but then the galactic economy collapsed , and seeing that custom built planets are a ... are a bit of a luxury commodity ...
come with me because there's been a terrible mix up with your planet .
best laid plans of mice , you know .
and men .
what?
best laid plans of mice and men .
yes , well , i don't think men have much to do with it .
here .
um , i must warn you , we're going to pass through , well , a sort of gateway thing .
huh?
it may disturb you .
it scares the willies out of me .
aghh !
aghh !
ha , ha , ha .
welcome to our factory floor .
okay .
all right .
all right .
yeah , this is it .
this is it .
o great deep thought !
we have traveled long ... ... and far .
have you calculated the ultimate question of life , the universe and everyhing?
no .
what?
i've been watching tv .
oh .
i designed another computer to do that .
oh , right , i forgot .
is it here?
no , it's not here .
it's another world .
it's on another world .
it is another world , stupid .
or it was until the vogons destroyed it to make way for a hyperspace expressway .
well ...
okay .
you sure you don't have the question , or a way to , you know , access it or something?
'cause i think i've done a lot to get here .
oh , shh , shh .
the show's back on .
well , i don't wanna bother you , so i'm gonna ...
good stuff .
great .
i'm gonna go and find something else for my entire life to be about .
zaphod , zaphod , there's the ... the gun .
gun?
that humma sent you for .
you gave him your head .
why'd i ...
why'd i do that?
okay .
that's stupid .
o deep thought , we were told that there is a gun .
there you are .
hm?
look familiar?
so it wasn't destroyed?
actually , it was .
this is a backup .
earth mark ll .
so you ... you made the earth?
not me alone , but i ...
i did my part .
ever heard of a place , i think it's called norway?
that was one of mine .
i ...
i got an award for it .
oh , hoo !
all right , frank?
that's ... that's frank .
ah ha .
they ... they've nearly finished the oceans .
zaphod .
here , it's ... ... it's just like humma said .
now you can go get your head back .
hey , ford .
it's been nice knowing you , you zarking frood .
no !
whoa !
this is a bust too .
h ...
h ...
hey , man .
you know , you must really be frustrated .
you go through all you have , you don't get an answer , which means no money or fame , which you deserve ...
the point of view gun , conveniently , does precisely what its name suggests .
fantastic .
fantastic .
fantastic .
if you point it at someone and pull the trigger , they instantly see things from your point of view .
give me that thing .
it was designed by deep thought , but commissioned by a consortium of intergalactic angry housewives who , after arguments with their husbands , were sick of ending those arguments with the phrase ,
you just don't get it , do you?
uh , uh , and you're right , i shouldn't be so upset because life goes on , you know , and i should just go on with it .
shoot him again .
whoa .
hitchhiking's good .
towels are good too .
say what?
that is brilliant .
what's goin '...?
i can see why humma kavula would want one of these .
we better get back .
arthur's waiting .
who cares?
i do .
especially since we're somewhat of an endangered species , thanks to you .
why so edgy , baby doll?
relax .
you wanna know why i'm edgy?
argh .
of course you're edgy .
your planet's been blown up and you've been tooling around with the guy who signed the order .
huh?
ugh !
you actually wanted to know the question because you always wondered if there was more to life and now you're crushed because you find out there really isn't .
hey , fantastic .
psychedelic .
you've got no home , no family , and you're stuck with me , another in a long line of men who doesn't really get you .
huh?
that's not true .
and you're worried you might have blown it with the one guy who really does .
hey , whoops .
oh , baby doll .
give me that thing .
it won't affect me .
i'm already a woman .
it's okay .
it's only a couple of little mice !
voila !
himalayas .
good , eh?
earthman , you must realize that the planet you lived on was commissioned , paid for and run by mice .
when you say mice , do you mean the little furry white creatures with whiskers , ears , cheese?
yeah , but they're protrusions into our dimension of hyperintelligent beings .
i don't know this cheese of which you speak , but they were there on earth as mice experimenting on you .
i see where you've become confused now .
you see , we were experimenting on them .
ah , no , well , yeah , no .
that's what they wanted you to think , but you were actually elements in their computer program .
actually , this explains a lot .
all my life , i've had this strange feeling there's something big and sinister going on in the world .
no , that's normal paranoia .
everyone in the universe gets that .
perhaps i'm old and tired , but the chances of finding out what's actually going on are so absurdly remote that the only thing to do is say hang the sense of it and keep yourself busy .
i'd much rather be happy than right any day .
and are you?
uh ... no .
that's where it all falls down , of course .
here you are then .
is this ...?
it's , um ...
it's all there .
you know , it all works .
welcome home .
hey !
hey , man !
there you are !
surprise !
what are you doing?
what happened to you?
is that tea?
first , our hosts attacked us .
right .
but then they made up for it by making us ... [ tearfully ] ... this amazing meal .
it's so ...
everyhing's right .
everyhing's delicious .
oh , come on , that's lovely .
we're glad you like it , earth creature .
the , um , talking ... talking mice .
cool .
sit , earthman .
oh , thank you .
thank you for that .
please , drink .
um , uh , excuse me .
uh , is there anything else?
no , we're quite happy , thank you .
um , good , i'll be outside , so ...
you were right .
please , drink .
yes .
he was right .
now , to business .
to business !
eat !
shh .
sorry .
we've spent a lot of time on your planet
iooking for this ultimate question .
only to have it blow up in our faces .
literally .
which is why you're here .
we've been offered a lucrative contract to do several 5 d tv chat shows .
but here's the point .
we must have product .
we need the ultimate question , or one that sounds ultimate .
of course .
we've rebuilt the planet .
now all we need is the missing piece of the puzzle .
which happens to be your brain .
right .
more tea?
sorry , did you just say you need my brain?
yes , to complete the program .
you can't have my brain .
i'm using it .
hardly .
hardly?
cheeky ...
cheeky mouse .
zaphod !
trillian !
ford .
what was in that food?
what was in my tea?
don't worry .
you won't feel a thing .
just wait a sodding minute .
you want a question that goes with the answer 42?
what about , what's 6x7?
or , um , uh , how many vogons does it take to change a light bulb?
here's one : how many roads must a man walk down?
hey , that's not bad .
fine .
fine , take it , 'cause my head is filled with questions , and no answer to any one of them has ever brought me one iota of happiness .
except for one .
the one .
the only question i've ever wanted an answer to .
is she the one?
the answer bloody well isn't 42 , it's yes .
undoubtedly , unequivocally , unabashedly , yes .
and for one week , one week in my sad little ... blip of an existence ... ... it made me happy .
that's a good answer .
we don't want to be happy .
we want to be famous .
what's this " ls she the one " tripe?
take his brain !
no , don't take the brain !
don't take the brain , mice !
it wasn't me !
i'm famous .
shoot him , quickly , shoot him !
oh , bollocks !
agghh !
i'm gonna be sick .
belgium .
follow me .
left , right , left , right .
attention !
thanks a lot for leaving me behind .
though i can't say i blame you .
mr president , we're here for your protection .
thanks , man .
i appreciate it .
fire !
no !
no !
what's all the fuss about?
vogons are the worst marksmen in the galaxy .
ooh .
for god's sake , stop !
cease fire .
now i've got a headache ... headache ... headache ...
marvin !
oh , no .
he's got a towel , run away !
i'm gonna get us outta here .
how do you drive this thing?
we need that gun .
come on .
get this ship started .
come on .
start !
come on .
oh , fire , fire !
fire , fire !
oo , hoo , hoo , hoo , hoo !
he's locked it from the other side .
we'll have to go the other way .
come on , let's go !
stop !
oh , no !
stop it !
stop it !
stop shooting at us !
oh , i feel so depressed .
i can't face another day .
what's the point?
you all right?
yeah .
sorry about your spaceship , arthur .
marvin , you saved our lives .
i know .
wretched , isn't it?
you got to ask yourself , what's the point?
take it away .
you could do all of that , but it's not gonna ... well , i'll ask ...
i'll just ask .
i ...
i ...
i've just been informed by some of the lads that since we're so near completion , we're gonna go ahead and finish earth .
oh .
we , well , we can put it back exactly as it was when you left , you know .
unless there's , um ... ... there's , you know , anything you want to change .
something you think your planet could do without .
yeah .
me .
oh !
um , hello?
no , as is .
yep , leave it .
yep .
let's go somewhere .
definitely .
where did you have in mind?
i know this great restaurant at the end of the universe .
i am a little peckish .
i need to go to humma's .
he's got something of mine .
i think .
i'm so confused .
don't worry , baby .
we'll sort it out .
all right , let's trip the light fantastic , baby .
just you and me .
come on .
you got your towel?
yeah .
why?
am i going to need it?
only always .
right .
yeah .
i wouldn't want to go anywhere without my wonderful towel .
okay .
hold tight .
stand by for commencement of life cycle .
in three , two , one ...
all right !
whoo !
not that anyone cares what i say , but the restaurant is at the other end of the universe .
yeah !
play it !
it is , of course , well known that careless talk costs lives .
but the full scale of the problem is not always appreciated .
for instance , at the very moment that arthur dent said ,
i wouldn't want to go anywhere without my wonderful towel " a freak wormhole opened up in the fabric of the space time continuum and carried his words far , far back in time , across almost infinite reaches of space , to a distant galaxy where strange and warlike beings were poised on the brink of frightful interstellar battle .
the two opposing leaders , resplendent in their black jeweled battle shorts were meeting for the last time , when a dreadful silence fell .
and at that very moment , the words " i wouldn't want to go anywhere without my wonderful towel " drifted across the conference table .
unfortunately , in their native tongue , this was the most appalling insult imaginable .
so the opposing battle fleets decided to settle their remaining differences , in order to launch a joint attack on our galaxy , now positively identified as the source of the offending remark .
for thousands of years , the mighty starships tore across the empty wastes of space and finally dived screaming onto the planet earth , where , due to a terrible miscalculation of scale , the entire battle fleet was accidentally swallowed by a small dog .
those who study the complex interplay of cause and effect in the history of the universe , say that this sort of thing is going on all the time .
