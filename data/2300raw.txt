<i>looked like leonard was trying</ i> <i>to get the breaking pitch inside ... </ i> <i> ... but it just didn't have</ i> <i>any break on it that time . </ i>
agent mackelway , we're over here .
i was gonna introduce you two , but i understand that won't be necessary .
seems your former office decided we needed help ... ... so they sent us agent kulok .
hey , tom .
hi , fran .
i guess we're gonna skip the tearful reunion .
have a seat , tom .
how are things in dallas?
wouldn't really know .
i've been chained to a desk .
okay , what do we know?
picked up a footprint in the back seat .
a size and a half bigger than speck's .
okay .
wounds on speck's throat indicate he was strangled from behind .
i think our guy was waiting for him in the back seat ... ... sprung this on him once the car was moving .
lab picked up talcum traces along the edges ... ... consistent with powdered gloves .
so he gets this dropped in his lap ... ... it spooks him , car ends up in the ravine .
that car was pushed to the state line .
the depth of the tire tracks ... ... footprints near the embankment .
that car wasn't going more than 3 miles an hour ... ... and it stopped literally on the state line .
guy must have used gps .
why would he push it to the state line?
same reason he did everything else , to get the fbl's undivided attention .
there's an association here .
you have a circle ... ... and a lidless eye that's always open .
seeing .
seeing .
or making sure that we're seeing .
it's just a feeling .
he was a normal guy .
you know , kind of quiet .
he liked to read fishing magazines , and he wasn't much of a tipper .
is that a lousy thing to say?
no , it's fine .
could you tell us about the other man?
like i said , i never really saw him .
harold came up complaining about the guy ... ... but by the time i turned around , he was gone .
can you desc ...?
desc
can you describe him , ma'am?
oh , sure .
you could tell he wasn't from around here .
did you see what he was driving?
you know , now that you mention it ... ... there's a torino out in the parking lot with a real crappy paint job .
it's been here since last night .
we need a protocol for interviewing witnesses .
fine .
i'll handle it .
always in control .
tell you something , tom ... ... i want my life back , so i want this over quick .
so , what happened?
your ring .
it didn't work out ... ... just like us .
so why are you here?
you vacationing in albuquerque?
oh , tom , you sure haven't changed in six whole months .
keys are in the car .
i don't need a babysitter ... ... so let's do it right this time .
then don't make things so unnecessarily complicated again .
trunk's ajar .
you listening to me?
you think i wanna be down here?
i'm not interested in hanging out ... ... and i'm not your babysitter .
i'm your partner .
i didn't put you here , remember .
and i'm not going through this again with you .
holy shit .

the all american diner in gallup .
hey , tom , got an id on our body .
barney fulcher , age 50 ... ... sixth grade teacher from colorado .
these plates aren't gonna help .
forget them .
this guy started in oklahoma , left these for us .
mrs. speck ... ... i just heard .
i'm so sorry .
i didn't know him well , but i think harold was a more complex person ... ... than people realize .
he was , wasn't he?
i'm really sorry for your loss , ma'am .

thank you so much .

daniel dyson?
hello?
fucking freak !
what a fucking freak .
can i help you?
why didn't you report it as stolen?
the truth is , i always hated that car .
nobody but benjamin could ever make it run right .
is that his name , benjamin?
it's hard to say .
that's what he liked to be called .
this bad wiring .
i think we've got an obsessive compulsive here .
i'll call grieves .
get him to work up a list of behaviourists for us to talk to .
give me that .
excuse me .
these came from benjamin?
he used to spend hours down here .
it was like ...
like his office .
what are these?
with those numbers and pictures , he said he could find anybody .
benjamin o'ryan?
special agent benjamin o'ryan , fbl .
it was his fantasy .
oh , fuck .
<i>agent mack elway , what the fuck</ i> <i>were you thinking? </ i>

tom .
you got an id?
what?
raymond starkey .
starkey did this?
tom , starkey's the guy on the ground .
you son of a bitch ... ... why are you baiting me?
you want me to see what you see .
you want me to see .
i'm trying to see it .
i'm trying to see it .
he opens up an old wound .
yeah .
what does he want?
i don't know .
maybe he's got something against law enforcement ... ... like the zodiac .
you're welcome , tom .
you're welcome , tom .
not fbl .
tom .
he's baiting me .
he wants me .
why?
what does he want?
okay .
tom , i want you to take me through this .
explain this to me .
okay .
see if this makes sense to you , okay?
each of the 45 abduction dates on these faxes correspond ... ... to one of the gps coordinates on o'ryan's map .
what about the two bodies we id'd?
okay .
well , let's find the faxes .
here we go .
male victim .
last seen , trenton , new jersey .
okay .
found in dyersville , iowa .
okay .
female .
last seen , dayton , ohio .
found in brownsville , texas .
so we have two bodies ... ... that were found 1000 miles from where they were last seen .
what's this?
that's tucumcari , new mexico .
why blue?
that's the only city where the date on the fax and the map didn't correspond .
christmas .
on o'ryan's map , 8 27 .
the only thing we know is there never was a benjamin o'ryan , fbl .
he would have made a hell of an agent .
autopsy reports just arrived for both the new positive ids .
bruises?
no , they're burn marks .
we've got them here too on our female from dayton .
and these marks relate to the marks found on fulcher and speck how?
they don't .
there were no burn marks on speck , fulcher or starkey .
and we have no slash circles here on these bodies .
right .
my office , as soon as someone finds something useful .
no luck on the behavioural specialists .
i do have a couple other leads that i'm following up on .
i'm hopeful they're gonna pan out .
great , thank you .
a professor of criminal biology , professor daitz , just called .
he says he's got time for you on saturday .
thank you , katie .
i was operating under the assumption that o'ryan was somebody's fantasy .
oh , no , he's real .
he was a student of mine .
that fax you sent me , this circle with the slash through it?
that's his construct , his theory .
he called it " suspect zero .
suspect zero?
he posited a theory that a serial killer ... ... could cross the entire country without ever getting caught .
what makes a killer catchable?
patterns , repetition of behaviour .
he imagined someone with no patterns ... ... no telltale fetishes , no rituals ... ... just a random killing machine that never leaves a clue .
but a serial killer by definition is condemned to repetition .
i mean , isn't that what he's all about?
well , he is until he isn't .
and this suspect zero , is that something that you believe in , doctor?
it's something o'ryan believed in .
he swore guys like that existed , only we couldn't see them ... ... because they didn't obey the usual laws , like cancer doesn't ... ... or the hlv virus that tricks your immune system ... ... into thinking it isn't there .
so you're saying a guy like that could exist?
do you know the definition of a black hole?
not precisely , no .
it's a celestial body with a gravitational force so strong ... ... that nothing escapes it .
not even light .
well , then how do you find something you can't see?
well , it was there and we found it .
why do you think o'ryan is convinced a person like that is around?
in this time and place .
what about a split personality?
could you have a stone cold killer on one hand ... ... and a thoughtful man with a conscience on the other?
i mean , could o'ryan ... ... possibly be this suspect zero?
yeah .
it's a viable theory .
i mean , the point is , i don't think you're gonna know until you find o'ryan .
<i>point is , i don't think you're</ i> <i>gonna know until you find o'ryan . </ i>
<i>just a random killing machine</ i> <i>that never leaves a clue . </ i>
yes , lord .
yes , lord .
sing it , lord .

hi .
fran , i need some help .

yeah , fran , i need somebody to talk to .
it's driving me crazy .
listen to me .
there's speck , a small town new mexico travelling salesman .
fulcher , a schoolteacher from boulder and then starkey .
i got a lock on him .
it's just there's something missing , and i can't ...
it's okay .

you got one of those pins in deming?
o'ryan was spotted there yesterday .
he took a squad car and a sidearm off a highway patrolman .
about an hour later a 5 year old boy was abducted a mile up the interstate .
we also found the bodies of two females in a dumpster off the highway .
your boy's been busy .
we're establishing a perimeter around the city .
was the patrolman hurt?
what's the difference?
he wasn't , was he?
he was fine .
the girls in the dumpster had fatal injuries .
o'ryan's not the guy .
he's chasing the guy or that patrolman would be dead .
can i ship this guy back to dallas?
o'ryan was fbl , you ever heard of a project called icarus?
no .
have you?
it's agents trained to see distant locations ... ... using only the mind .
they call it remote viewing .
bureau stole it from the army .
they use it to track down serial killers .
what?
you don't believe me?
it's bullshit?
it's voodoo?
it worked .
they made a science of it .
that's how he drew this .
he'd never been in this house ... ... he just saw what was there .
the bureau taught him ... ... and he's using it to track suspect zero .
you know what?
i'm extremely tired of that term .
profile the guy .
he's straight out of quantico .
he's working like we would .
he's not kidnapping , he's chasing the guy ... ... that's doing the kidnapping .
look at the map .
okay .
what you're telling me is all these abductions are the work of one guy .
yes .
mac , do you realize how insane that is?
fran , please help me .
he's not listening to me .
tom , i'm not sure that you're seeing things very clearly right now .
tom ... ... let's just try something that actually makes sense .
this guy sends in these faxes .
he picks off three scumbags .
why?
so that we'll think what you're thinking , that we got a friend .
somebody who's willing to take out the trash for us , and it's horseshit .
what if it isn't?
what if there is a suspect zero , and o'ryan's the one guy who's got a shot?
for fuck's sake , mackelway .
when did you start buying into this guy?
well , he's smarter than we are .
speak for yourself .
i'm going to deming .
you can take the rest of the day off .
<i>i'll be damned . </ i>
kulok here .
<i> hey . </ i>
where are you?
i'm headed towards tucumcari .
listen , those marks on the bodies , could they be freezer burns?
let me get into this .
yeah .
there's crystallization because the blood never clotted .
freezer burn .
he keeps the bodies in a freezer and buries them 1000 miles apart?
hey , tom , what's going on?
i got a possible suspect .
that kid's been a brat all morning .
i turned around ...
see what you caused?
are you afraid?
it'd be custom here at this point to start praying .
i see a lot of that .
haven't heard too many answers though .
you're alone .
come on .
are you afraid?
where's the boy?
my , my !
must be extremely satisfying to hear yourself say something so heroic .
i'm almost envious .
the boy's in pieces under the bed .
now are you afraid?
i know what you're thinking , " pain is coming .
will i take it like a man .
let me put you at ease , you won't .
none of them do .
men , women , children , they all weep , they all beg .
they pass out , piss themselves , attempt negotiations .
you wouldn't believe how many men i've seen where you are .
grown men with wives and children at home ... ... offering sexual gratification for a five minute reprieve .
it's pathetic .
are you afraid?
when they realize there's nothing left to negotiate , and they're helpless ...
well , the look in their eyes , the level of surrender ... ... it's almost pornographic .
i put that mirror here because i didn't want you to miss it .
are you afraid?
look in the mirror .
are you afraid?
look in the mirror .
are you afraid?
look in the mirror , o'ryan .
hey , you , fucking mackelway .
look at yourself , look in the mirror .
are you afraid , mackelway?
look at yourself .
are you afraid? !
no , i'm not afraid .
open your eyes !
open your eyes , goddamn it ... ... or i'll cut the fucking lids off !
then cut the fucking lids off !
<i>the initiation used to be more civil . </ i>
<i>i'm sorry about that . </ i>
<i>you're part of it now . </ i>
there were five of us , you know .
the most skilled ... ... technical remote viewers on project icarus .
you come in in the morning , have a cup of coffee , talk about the yankees .
you go to your room with your pen ... ... and your pad of paper , always alone .
you try and lock in , you crank out an ideogram .
son of sam , john wayne gacy , ted bundy .
he might be driving his car , having a beer , brushing his teeth ... ... cutting someone's eyes out .
if you did it right , you got it all .
the way it sounded , the way it smelled .
those people were looking right up at you , begging you for mercy .
it was like being god .
but , of course , you're not god .
can't do a thing for them .
they wired us into this current , the five of us ... ... darkness , the pit itself .
we were plugged right into it , and no one taught us how to turn it off .
we saw things men shouldn't see .
agony ... ... torture ... ... evil .
it never shut off .
i checked once with all the guys that'd ... ... been on the project when it was just used for intel .
you know , finding gun runners and drug lords , soviet missile sites ... ... even the iran hostages .
anyway , i checked with them , and they're all okay .
but the five of us ... ... plugged into the brains and nervous systems of human beings ... ... that's when we lost it .
we're all either dead or institutionalised .
after a while , those conversations about the yankees became impossible .
o'ryan .
those faxes ... ... the missings ... ... how many of them are his?
all of them .
you were the missing piece , mac .
now everything is in place .
all you have to do is finish it .
this is mackelway .
i'm travelling north , approaching l 54 at tucumcari , request backup .
i'm pursuing a possible suspect in a refrigerated truck .
brake !
hey , tom !
tom !
get the trailer open !
there's a kid in the trailer .
hey , buddy .
you okay?
i got you , okay?
okay , come here .
i got you .
get an ambulance .
yes , ma'am .
i knew i was right about you .
no .
no , that wasn't me .
of course it was you .
wasn't me .
wasn't the wind .
you beat him to death .
now all you have to do is finish it .
finish it !
understand , none of this was arbitrary .
we were chosen , you and i.
it's not a bad start , mac .
you made the world a little safer .
we made justice .
this wasn't justice .
yes , it was !
and so is this .
i'm not going to kill you , o'ryan .
you already have .
i've seen it a thousand times .
no , you saw wrong .
that's impossible !
i saw us here .
i saw all of it !
me baiting you , testing you !
look at him !
you've arrived !
you're cursed , like me ... ... only you keep running from it !
you hear things , you see things ... ... that's why you can't sleep .
why your head always aches .
get up .
get up .
there is no zero .
you're confused , old man .
can't you see that?
you think we did something mythical here today?
you think we put an end to evil?
we killed a deviant , that's all .
there are thousands of them out there .
o'ryan , you're a guy with a skill .
you're not god .
you can't see everything .
you don't decide what's justice .
freeze !
please , mac .
i can't sleep anymore .
i keep seeing all those faces .
the ones i couldn't save .
all those missings .
you know , they never blink .
they're all in here .
i want you to shut it off for me .
please , mac , i'm so tired .
i just want you to shut it off for me .
shut it off for me .
i can't .
i'm not you .
yet .
so tired .
so tired .
thank you .
