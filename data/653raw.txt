what's up?
you are so lucky you didn't ruin this dress .
mom , i know you're angry , but there's something you need to know .
this was all sally's fault .
oh , really?
and how , exactly , was it sally's fault?
give me a minute .
i'm workin 'on it .
save it , conrad .
why today?
why did you have to pick today to destroy the house?
you know what's happening today .
i tried to tell him , mom .
mom's throwing a very important party , " i said .
all ofher important clients will be here .
but he went right ahead and wrecked the house and let nevins get away .
now , again , i hope you're going to ground him .
yes , sally , for a week , but that's none of your business .
aweek?
come on .
two days .
i asked you to do one thing today , conrad ... keep the house clean .
do you know how frustrating it is that you're always doing the exact opposite of what i say?
<i>knock , knock , knock . </ i>
someone lose a dog?
<i>i found him next door ... </ i> in my yard ... again .
you are a saint .
and here i thought you were only dating me for my good looks .
lucky us .

okay , that's great .
uh , look , pal , be a sport .
why don't you go tidy up the living room .
okay ... <i>dude? </ i>
i don't have to listen to you , larry .
conrad , do what lawrence says .
have you given some thought about the wilhelm academy?
you mean the colonel wilhelm military academy fortroubled youth?
that's the one , joan .
i'm not sure it's right for conrad .
oh , joan , joan .
joan , joan , joan .
i have so much respect foryou , joan .
single mother , careerwoman , raising two children on your own , and still fiinding time to be the best darned real estate agent in town .
i know how hard it is , joan .
it is hard .
oh ...
i know .
<i>and i know</ i> <i>how hard you're trying . </ i>
this is a once in a lifetime proposition , and you must act now .
the colonel wilhelm military academy fortroubled youth ... is what we call in the sales game a win win scenario .
a top flight military school , and it's only ... eight hours away .
<i>[ phone rings ] </ i>
oh , the phone .
<i>[ phone rings ] </ i>
i heard what you said .
i'm not going to military school , larry .

i know i'm not your dad ... and this is probably really strange foryou ... your neighbor's dating your mom .
but here's the thing , son .
come here .
i don't like you either .
but i'm gonna marry your mom .
and if it was up to me , you'd be at military school today .
i'm not going to military school .
ohh !
i think you're gonna love it .
it's just like summer camp , except with brutal forced marches ... and soul crushing discipline .
and one more thing ...
it's lawrence , you snot nosed son of a ... wonderful woman who i'm absolutely crazy about !
oww !
gosh , i love children !
oh , joan , i didn't see you there .
would you be a doll and help me bring up chairs from the basement?
nothing would give me more pleasure , joan , but i do have to run .
i have a very important sales conference downtown .
oh .
okay .
well , i'll see you at the party tonight .

thing two would like to clarify that just because he wears the number two ... does not imply in any way that he's inferior to thing one .

he will also accept superthing , thing king , kid dynamite ,
