" thou art with me .
thy rod and staff ... ... they comfort me .
thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies .
thou anointest my head with oil .
my cup runneth over .
surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life .

seor brake .
lndian .
apache , maybe .
some kind of apache son of a bitch .
good day , sir .
i said , hello .
that your man over there in the trees?
what is he planning on doing with that carbine?
we've had trouble with coyotes killing calves .
tell him i'm not a coyote .
ls that the healer's place?

lady shuts her doors at sundown .
she's pretty firm about her hours .
you're welcome to spend the night , see her in the morning .
i thank you kindly .
barn's this way , mister .
there's a spare bunk over there , mr ....
mr. fernandez .
jones .
the man that owned that saddle tried to kill me .
i was living with the jicarilla .
i suppose he thought i was one of them .
you're apache , huh?
what did you say?
forget it .
what did you say?
come over here .
now , i mean it !
there'll be no trouble here .
lf that's too tough for you to understand , you can move on .
emiliano , unpack his mule .
you will keep your hands off of my mule ... ... emiliano .
don't slam that door .
yes , ma'am .
there are houses in cleveland with lamps that run on electricity .
i'd like to see cleveland .
can you fetch the water , please , dot?
yes , ma'am .
at the fair , there's gonna be expositions of the future .
there's gonna be a graphophone .
you can hear your own voice back on it .
the dickersons are going .
brake can't spare you .
ma .
not tomorrow with the cows calving .
the fosters too .
got all the future you need right here .
riding all day with this cramping and all .
don't you ever act helpless and pitiable to win favor with a man .
some people shouldn't give advice on how to act with men .
and it's " pitiful " in english .
you heard what i said .
that pail's half empty .
i didn't do it .
it's that old lndian's dumb old mule .
what lndian?
some drifter looking for doctoring .
lf you're gonna eat barefoot ... ... why not take supper with the animals in the barn .
my boots don't fit no more .
cut off my blood circulation .
it's your birthday soon .
i'll have gangrene by then .
your mother may have to saw off your feet , then .
like poor old mr. swenson .
mr. jones .
maggie , this is the visiting gentleman i mentioned .
i'll bet a warm meal sounds pretty good to you .
magdalena .
i'm afraid we have just enough food for family .
we can't be offering our hospitality tonight .
i'm sure we can all do with less .
i'm sure we can't !
i have two growing girls to feed .
maggie?
maggie .
lilly , why don't you say grace .
who is he?
called you magdalena .
your hair bristles when you lay eyes on him .
he scares me , is all .
nobody scares you .
can't trust him .
maggie , who is he?
he's my father .
i thought your father was dead .
he is .
to me , he is .
i want him gone , brake .
gone?
he's your kin .
you just can't
he ran off when i wasn't dot's age .
went lndian .
turn your back , he'll eat your horses and dogs .
he's being chased ... ... or running from something , i don't know what .
but he's bad , brake .
i swear .
i do not want him near my children .
we're lndians , lilly .
we're lndians .
does he do that all night?
oh , he's just getting started .
you come here for the healing?
ln a manner of speaking .
thought you might be hungry .
it's rabbit stew .
i can't eat rabbits .
i was bitten by a rattlesnake .
all right .
when there's company , you sleep in there . ls that right?
that's right .
you're not her husband?
no , sir .
not for lack of asking .
they your children?
no .
what happened to their father?
you don't know this?
i can't say what all happened between you two ... ... but you ain't welcome here .
but she's a good christian .
she won't turn away any man in need .
tomorrow , she'll give you what doctoring she can ... ... then you're on your way .
there's places where a father would kill a man ... ... for doing what you're doing , you know that , don't you?
lf you have something to say , say it .
are you really a lndian?
brake said you rode with the chiricahua .
that's right .
so that means i'm part lndian , right?
no .
not at all .
you look stupid trying to work in those fancy clothes , you know .
i am leaving here as soon as i can .
i'm moving to the city .
but grandpa's visiting .
did you see him?
he's a savage .
they're gut eaters , you know .
i was born into the wrong family , i swear to god i was .
i appreciate this .
take off your shirt .
magdalena  don't call me that .
it's not my name .
where's it hurt?
hurts when i breathe .
mostly around here .
yeah .
your muscles are torn just under your ribs .
you need to put a cottonwood plaster to it .
you'll live .
i never thought you'd turn out to be a healer .
i remember you had that yellow cat one time .
you cried because a badger bit its tail off .
your mother came running  don't remember .
not in front of me .
because i remember my mother .
my mother died scrubbing a man's floor .
and you killed her .
didn't shoot her or stab her , but what you did ....
you broke her !
and i remember my brother too .
he lasted six years .
i bet you never even knew his name .
and i remember praying hard every night that you'd come home .
on the day i put him in the ground ... ... l remember praying even harder you were dead .
so you don't want to reminisce with me , that i promise you .
i earned this money in large part ... ... killing mountain lions for ranchers like you .
i want you to have it .
lf i were destitute and drawing my last breath
this is good money .
take it for your children .
take it for your funeral .
magdalena .
i've done my duty as a christian .
you get the hell off my ranch !
i'd stop now .
maggie asked you to leave .
i think it's time you did so , sir .
right about now .
so long .
nice making your acquaintance .
what's done is done , i guess .
i know you would have done different .
i appreciate your regard , brake .
i do .
well , night , then .
did they see you come in?
we can't make a sound .
figure we can get them all branded in a day?
you want dot to stay for company?
brake , you said i could go .
you promised .
mama , you promised too .
oh , i'm fine .
he won't be coming back .
this will help the cramping .
the calves are more important ... ... than hearing your voice come out of a machine .
well , i guess you never had anything but this .
so why should l?
come on , let's get going .
you sure look frilly to be working cattle .
i'll keep an eye on them .
just be home before dark .
all right .
all right .
easy now .
that's right .
dot?
dot?
darling?
get !
get !
dot?
no !
no !
dot !
oh , lord .
darling .
mama , i'm cold .
i'm here , darling .
are you all right?
i'm cold .
i'm cold .
mama , i'm cold .
darling , where's lilly?
emiliano .
yeah , i know .
darling , where's lilly?
emiliano and me ... ... we was in the arroyo .
we heard shots from where brake and lilly was .
he told me , " stay down " ... ... emiliano did .
don't move .
stay down .
he went to see ... ... but he didn't come back .
i waited like he said , but he didn't come back .
brake was screaming , mama .
he screamed so long i wanted him to stop .
i know .
i know it .
i know it .
then he did .
then someone rode away with lilly .
i wanted him to stop !
i know it .
i know it .
darling , did you see who?
who took your sister?
he wore a hood .
he was lndian .
i'm sorry for your loss , ma'am , but i'm afraid you got the wrong fella in mind .
i've had the man you're describing in jail since last night .
sold himself a lion's hide and got quite a drunk on .
unacceptable drunk .
he did say he was staying out by your place , though .
there's been raids like this on people here lately ... ... in arizona and new mexico .
some apaches jumped the reservation at san carlos middle of last month .
we've been getting communications about them near every day .
to fort bowie .
from me .
possible your hostiles attacked local ranch .
two dead , one girl missing .
named ....
lilly gilkeson .
lilly gilkeson .
stop .
this takes just a moment .
the device is truly a miracle .
and now you'll hear your voice back as clear as day .
ladies .
my name's louise dewey .
my name's louise dewey .
to sheriff purdy ... ... of chloride .
believe hostiles ... ... headed northwest ... ... toward colorado river .
fourth cavalry ... ... will pursue ... ... in due course .
well , there you have it .
i'll send the undertaker out ...
... for the remains .
you're not going after them?
not under the present circumstances , ma'am .
with the fair in town , i need all the men i have right here .
lf you don't follow now , their trail will get cold .
the army is handling the situation .
they have apache scouts .
takes an apache to catch an apache .
lf someone doesn't go now , my daughter may be dead .
ma'am , i am elected to keep vigil over this town of ours .
just one or two men , sir , that's all i'm asking .
ma'am , i am sorry .
seth , i need a word with you .
it was the lndians did it .
now , ladies , i will not authorize fireworks until a water wagon is here .
ma'am , that's the drunkard from last night .
what would you like me to do with him?
let him go .
i don't care .
mama?
darling .
i want you to ride to the handys '...
no .
no , i won't . ... and stay there till i get back .
i won't stay behind .
i'll follow you as soon as you're gone , you know i will .
darling  i'm not you can't leave me , ma .
i'm going with you , mama , please , i am .
now , you hear me , dot  i'm not staying behind .
wherever you put me , i'm coming after you , ma .
you know i'm not gonna stay put .
i swear to god , i won't stay put .
hush , hush .
hush , now .
it's all right .
hush .
the army's headed in the wrong direction .
seventeen horse tracks .
three shod , one outrider , two cavalry horses .
six horses were tied together ... ... carrying light loads .
probably young women , children .
and their captives ... ... those are being led along ... ... like packhorses .
they're headed south .
not north .
probably trying to make it to the mexican border .
the apaches sell a lot of girls over there .
top dollar .
can you track them?
you can track them .
but if you catch them , you'll wish you'd stayed home .
i don't wanna catch them .
keep me on the trail till i get the army down to fort selden to catch them .
you wanted to give me money .
do this instead .
taking this child out there is foolish .
i know my daughter .
leave her behind , she'll just follow .
no way to care for a girl .
what would you know about any of it?
i'll be just fine , thank you .
come on , now .
pretty moon , anne .
old bob hadley was supposed to stop by tonight .
god .
mama , i'm afraid in my room .
it's just your fever giving you bad dreams , honey .
you want mama to sing you a song?
your man didn't keep his rifle very clean .
lf he wanted to marry you , though , i guess that's something .
he's not all bad .
did you ever marry?
dot's father was my husband .
he built the ranch with me .
the notion of it was better than the doing , i guess .
what about the other one's father?
didn't get much of a look at him .
maggie?
what you're doing , you're doing for your own soul .
because what you've done , you can't undo .
you can all move now .
sir ... ... do you suppose it's safe for me to be on my way now?
mister , i don't suppose nothing .
you're theirs now .
they captured you .
could you help me , please?
go into the cave .
bring picture maker .
go !
take them .
you're heartless .
i see you gentlemen are engaging in a little frontier recreation out here .
no , these girls are going to market .
we ain't supposed to sully the merchandise .
i can smell him from here .
i see you share a fondness for the photographic arts like myself .
where did you find this squashed penis?
we captured him as a gift for you .
sir , may i have the honor of posing you with your captives , please?
he wants to take your picture .
please , please .
that's perfect .
now ...
... very still .
help us .
help .
please help us .
look your best .
lord , protect us .
stay behind me .
lndians .
yeah .
but not the way you're thinking .
ls there time enough to give these men a proper christian burial?
dead's dead , one way or the other .
i asked if there was time .
yeah .
there's time .
get in .
you must be the pride of your people .
and you of yours .
prepare to dismount !
dismount !
the two on the porch have expired , lieutenant .
ask him why he murdered those men .
i didn't murder anybody .
they were dead when i got here .
what are you doing in here?
my granddaughter was stolen two days ago .
i trailed her to this place .
what's her name?
you don't know your granddaughter's name?
well , her sister's name is dot .
we found two horses with a bunch of women's property in them .
hang him .
other side !
there he goes !
i didn't kill anyone !
i said , i didn't kill anyone !
come out and show your hands !
i am looking for my granddaughter !
then you tell me her damn name !
i don't know her damn name !
lilly !
lilly gilkeson .
you know this lndian?
he's no lndian .
damn well looks lndian to me .
no , he's a ....
that's my father .
i've been hoping we'd find you , sir .
we need your help .
we tracked my daughter south from chloride .
they're heading toward mexico .
near as we can figure ... ... they've hit six or seven homesteads so far , including this one .
army should've killed the heathens when they had a chance .
they are army , ma'am .
deserters .
why , i thought they were apache .
apache scouts .
formerly on uncle sam's payroll .
like happy jim here .
we use them to hunt other apaches .
the lndians were american soldiers?
then a couple of months ago , some of them turned ... ... shot some white officers and jumped the reservation in san carlos .
the 4th cavalry started all this by hanging their chief .
don't know what they were thinking .
what makes you think they were thinking?
this whole territory's gone topsy turvy .
you got lndians running with whites , whites running with lndians .
get those prisoners moving !
come on , squaw man .
get on the way here .
happy jim .
you think because you're wearing that coat they won't put you on the prison train to florida with chains on your legs?
i don't know of florida .
it's a real swell shit hole of a swamp .
you'll see .
white man , you don't look like someone who gives good advice .
break it up !
what's going on here?
i said , break it up .
i found it first , lieutenant .
lying bastard !
looks like god intended you two to share .
any man found looting ... ... will have the value of their property deducted from his pay .
they're enlisted men .
post two men over there .
i'm going to camp down by the river .
lf i stay here long , i might misbehave . right over there .
somebody might have to kill me .
lieutenant?
i imagine you plan to ride first thing .
would it be all right if my daughter and i rode along with you?
naturally , i'm quite concerned .
ma'am , capturing those renegades is the army's highest priority .
yes , of course .
butcher a couple goats for supper !
and i'm grateful .
but that's the assignment of the 4th .
but the 4th is going in the wrong direction .
i assure you , they'll be redirected as soon as we reach fort stanton .
stanton's three days away .
my daughter will be in mexico by then .
i grieve for your situation , i truly do .
but my assignment is to return these hostiles in my capture to stanton ... ... for their prompt and immediate deportation .
you like fish?
go water the horses .
i watered them back at the  i'm not asking .
don't make them too raw , please .
very well , ma'am .
lilly , she's ... ... not the same as dot .
she's not strong .
she gets hurt so easy .
sage?
what?
for the fish .
i know i asked you to get us to the army
i asked you if you wanted some sage put on your fish .
yeah .
all right .
none for dot .
we'll ride at first light in the morning .
lf we can catch up to them , i might have enough money to buy her back .
lf they make it to mexico ... ... your child is lost .
hey , that stuff will make you sick , but i like it .
no , no , no , no .
whoa .
that flash behind her head bother you?
it's just
whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa .
there's no magic .
it's an optical defect .
a flaw .
a flaw .
flaw .
wait , wait .
hey , wait .
look at these .
look at these .
see?
i know where all the prettiest girls live , from arizona to texas .
you pick the ones you want , and i'll take you right to them .
look !
all the pretty girls , see?
all of them !
i'll take you look !
take your bad luck to your grave .
what was that?
what did you just do?
i'll get it done .
who of you can skin a deer?
hey !
who of you can skin a deer?
me .
i can .
all right .
gotta gut her .
i can't see .
what is happening to me?
somebody tell me .
what is happening?
i can't see .
i can't see .
please !
where's clubfoot going?
i thought we was dropping back down into mexico .
seven's an unlucky number for him .
he wants eight girls .
we go now .
shit !
here .
fill the packs with meat .
i gotta take sally .
no , i gotta take my little girl .
no !
she just needs water .
she's fine .
shut up .
she's dead now , mama .
she's my baby .
shut up .
no !
no !
no !
no !
no , no , no , no .
no !
get up !
get up !
get up !
trying to make a fool of me .
it's gonna be all right .
i think my feet grew two sizes today .
try these .
they're beautiful .
they were my wife's .
my grandmother?
no .
mama !
mama !
dot?
you all right?
you get bit?
did those snakes bite you?
no .
mama , a dead man's in there .
don't worry about that child .
go on now .
mama , look at his eyes .
what happened to him?
he lost control of his wagon .
maybe he had a heart seizure .
he didn't have a heart seizure .
his heart's in that hole .
what's behind her head?
some people would think it's a sign .
a good sign or bad sign?
it wasn't a very good sign for him .
come here .
what are you doing?
these are for protection .
the man who did this is a brujo .
a what?
it's a witch .
you need to wear one too .
you can believe in your witchcraft and your impiety all you want .
i believe in what i've seen , girl .
snakes belong on the ground .
this one hangs them in the air .
a man's heart holds his spirit .
this one digs it out and throws it in the dirt .
don't you start this .
i know a brujo who'd put an arrow in you a mile away .
i know a brujo who laid his hand on a child one time .
one time .
the child cramped up , fell down and spit up bees till she died .
you stop this .
you're scaring her .
she needs to be scared .
so do you .
mama , please .
please .
just on her .
we gotta get through that canyon before the storm hits .
you go on and i'll follow .
give me some of the medical stuff they stole , the laudanum .
you like that stuff .
you know , i drink enough of this stuff , i swear ...
... you start to look good to me .
hey .
they give this to my grandma when she was fixing to croak .
mama !
mama !
i'll get her !
get those horses to higher ground !
i've got her !
dot , you hold on to me !
my foot's caught !
hold your breath !
right now !
gotta piss .
sit up .
i can get us out of here .
do you hear that?
you mustn't speak .
my baby's calling me .
no .
i'm sorry .
i'm so sorry .
your baby's passed on .
no .
that's just how she sleeps .
there's nothing you can do , so please just
there , there .
my baby .
here .
watch out while i get the horses .
hey .
just going to get those berries i promised you .
don't wander off .
lord , forgive me .
stop squirming .
goddamn you !
give her to me .
get up !
no !
i got her .
no !
tie her legs !
shut up !
shut up !
why?
now we're gonna be back to seven , and seven's an unlucky number .
whore !
stop !
thank you .
crawl .
you're better than them , but you're not better than me .
can she have the moccasins now?
yeah .
can i just?
i'm glad you were here .
i was bitten by a rattlesnake .
what?
a good shaman gave me two amulets .
told me not to eat rabbit meat for a year ... ... to say my prayers every morning ... ... take care of my family , and i might get well .
you're telling me the only reason you came back ... ... was because you were following the say so of some ... ... medicine man . ls that right?
yes .
absolutely .
a rattlesnake can make your soul ...
... very sick .
that's likely not what you want to hear .
but it is the truth .
we have eight girls .
now , we can go .
