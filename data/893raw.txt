hello?
hello .
hercule lajoy?
who wants to know?
marie jouvet .
i'm a television reporter .
i know what you are .
can i come aboard?
i want to talk to you .
you want answers?
of course .
how can i give you answers?
i am taking a nap .
i il wait until you wake up .
all right .
you're even better looking than you are on television .
thank you .
thank you .
i don't know why , but i have the distinct impression that i was expected .
clouseau has disappeared .
you're a reporter .
elementary .
spoken like a true policeman .
a retired policeman .
may i sit?
as you choose .
you worked with clouseau .
yes .
he was unique .
intuitive?
a man who followed his hunches?
who can tell what he followed?
but he was the most successful man in the force .
everything i thought made up a proper investigation , he did the opposite .
facts , hercule .
facts .
nothing matters but the facts .
without them , the science of criminal investigation is nothing more than a guessing game .
listen to me , hercule , and you will learn something .
the facts in this case are : the body of the chauffeur was found in the bedroom of the second maid .
fact !
cause of death : four bullets in the chest .
fact !
the bullets were fired at close range from a . 25 beretta automatic .
fact !
maria gambrelli was discovered with the murder weapon in her hand .
fact !
the murder weapon was registered in the name of the deceased , miguel ostos , and was kept in the glove compartment of the ballon rolls royce .
fact !
members of the household staff have testified that miguel ostos beat ...
you fool , you've broken my pointing stick .
i ve got nothing to point with now .
have testified that miguel ostos beat maria gambrelli frequently .
and finally comes this sworn statement of monsieur and madame ballon , as well as all the members of the staff , each of them with perfect alibis .
now then , hercule .
what is the inescapable conclusion?
maria gambrelli killed the chauffeur .
what?
you idiot !
impossible .
she's protecting someone .
how do you know that?
instinct !
but the facts ...
you are forgetting the most important fact motive .
he beat her .
he was spanish .
he tore her dress off .
don't be ridiculous !
would you kill somebody who tore your dress off?
no , i suppose not .
of course not .
no .
there is no doubt in my mind whatsoever , hercule .
maria gambrelli is most definitely protecting somebody .
find that somebody and you have found the murderer .
and i shall find the murderer before the day is out .
maria gambrelli will tell me who he is .
yet clouseau was proved right .
maria gambrelli was innocent .
clouseau was always proved right at the end of the case .
but on the way even he made a few miscalculations .
agh !
and now he is lost in the sea .
i admired his successes , but his methods ...
they made a mockery of everything i knew of police work , so i quit .
but i have a good life .
i carry a few cargoes .
i charter to a group of tourists in august when it gets too hot to stay in paris .
don't you miss it sometimes , the excitement?
young lady , if i missed the excitement don't you think i would bait my hook?
thank you , hercule lajoy .
i like you .
i don't think you're the hard case you make yourself out to be .
i like hercule too , just because he is the hard case he seems to be .
but if you really want to get to the bottom of this clouseau thing , forget about us , the ones on his side of the law .
dig up some of the crooks he caught , or didn't catch .
goodbye .
call again when you're in the area !
thank you .
i may do that .
they only show the top half of you on television .
i m glad the bottom is just as good .
me too .
how's business?
better .
pickin 'up .
clouseau disappears .
business gets better .
sure thing , yeah .
this marie jouvet is snoopin 'around .
so what?
who knows?
but i think it's better we put a tail on her .
luis , she's no dummy .
you pick a couple of good boys?
done .
when i first met inspector clouseau , about 20 years ago , in cortina ,
i had a nasty ski accident and unfortunately clouseau happened to be staying at the same hotel .
ow !
ow !
excuse me .
my leg is caught .
you were married to the inspector?
yes .
had you known sir charles before cortina?
only casually .
i am willing to bet you 10, 000 francs that the phantom is in cortina at this very moment .
even , perhaps , in this room .
how exciting .
what do you think , mr tucker?
i agree .
ten of his last 15 victims have been guests at angela dunning's parties .
what are we all talking about?
the notorious phantom .
i m afraid i ve never heard of him .
he seems to be quite a fellow .
there are few thieves who are as clever as the phantom .
each theft is completely different and unique , classic in its conception .
i thought your theory is that he does repeat himself .
only with regard to angela dunning's parties .
however , there is one other duplication , but that is his ... trademark , his calling card , so to speak .
he leaves a white monogrammed glove .
sounds terribly theatrical .
your highness , if i were the phantom , i'd have chosen my victim already .
really?
and who would that be?
who owns the most fabulous diamond in the world?
i suppose i do .
exactly .
the pink panther .
such a prize he could never resist .
he'd be disappointed .
the pink panther is in my safe at ...
your highness , please .
don't say it , not here .
your highness , i read there was a dispute over the ownership of the pink panther .
it belongs to me .
it was a gift from my late father .
i shall never surrender it .
why should you?
when this government seized power , they claimed it belonged to the people .
there's talk of the international court deciding the issue .
why don't i steal the diamond , leave that old glove behind ,
and you and i can split the insurance?
all right .
i feel like dancing .
your highness?
i d love to .
how about you , madame?
yes , of course .
your leg is better , sir charles?
what?
i say your leg is better .
yes .
much better .
thank you .
you know , mr tucker ...
argh !
that's my beer .
in may 1964 you divorced inspector clouseau and a year later ...
i married the man of my dreams .
who was that , darling?
you know .
that fellow clouseau accused of being the notorious phantom .
you have to forgive her .
she's not very good on names .
he's terribly attractive .
but she has impeccable taste .
why did clouseau think it was you?
an anonymous phone call .
i see .
come up immediately .
sir charles .
the phantom .
i ve really got him this time .
but of course he was wrong .
about what?
about you being the phantom .
of course .
he was wrong .
wrong , but persistent .
persistent he was .
he was convinced that i was planning to steal the pink panther .
and when princess diala gave a costume ball at a villa in rome ,
clouseau was there with his men .
warm .
yes , must be hell in there .
bet it's not so good in there .
anything suspicious?
no , nothing to worry about .
my men are everywhere .
mingling here , mingling there , watching all the time .
how dare you drink on duty?
who is inside there?
sergeant walter .
sergeant coff .
stop that or i il have your stripes !
the pink panther was stolen that night?
by a gorilla .
come back !
it s me !
to my dying day ,
i'll never forget that old man trying to cross the street .
come on , faster !
what's the matter with you?
can't you drive this thing faster?
this is the road they have gone up .
don't argue with me !
i know where they've gone .
george , how do we get out of here?
i don't know .
i ve been all over this place .
how do we get out?
you try the high road .
i il take the high road , you take the low road .
so long .
ciao , george .
that's them !
no , it isn't .
for a while , it looked as though clouseau himself was the phantom .
he was actually arrested for having stolen the pink panther and sent to prison .
tucker !
but he was innocent .
inept , but innocent .
inept?
wouldn't you say so , darling?
not in everything , darling .
he was a terrific sleeper .
it s hard to believe .
it s true .
he almost never made a serious mistake while he was sleeping .
i mean , inept !
france's greatest detective !
it does test one's reality .
do you think he's dead?
i hope not .
what do you think , sir charles?
no .
men like clouseau never die .
they're indestructible .
that's how it should be .
why?
we need them .
they help us preserve our sense of humour .
and they're living proof that , however bad things get , if you persevere you survive and sometimes even win .
so you think determination was the key to his success?
no question about it .
he was a fool but he epitomised the i ith commandment .
the i ith commandment?
" thou shalt not give up .
i like that .
i thought you might .
goodbye .
goodbye .
come and see us again .
i may do that .
the man of your dreams is also a machiavellian charmer .
i know that .
thank you .
goodbye .
bye .
you've just passed the hotel .
yes , ma'am .
but that's where i wanted to go .
you see that car following us?
what about it?
the two men in that car suggested i drop you off at another address .
what are you talking about?
actually , it was more like a threat .
they threatened you?
one of them showed me his new gun .
who are they?
i know you'll think i m not on the ball , but i neglected to get their names .
you realise this is kidnapping?
yeah .
i have to be honest with you .
i couldn't come up with an alternative .
you can go to prison for life for kidnapping .
lady , the gun he showed me was a . 38 magnum .
i don't know anything about guns .
that gun makes enormous holes in things .
i had a choice between kidnapping you and getting shot with that gun .
to be perfectly frank , i would look terrible and feel worse with an enormous hole in me .
miss jouvet , how nice of you to come .
did i have a choice?
actually , no .
let's go where we can be private .
do i have a choice?
i just wanna have a talk with you .
watch your step .
i always do .
why the drama?
you could have phoned .
would you have come?
to see the french godfather?
bruno , i m a reporter .
and a terrific lookin 'one at that .
take a swim .
come on .
let's make ourselves comfortable .
have a seat .
can i have a drink?
do i have a choice?
actually , no .
how about some champagne?
terrific .
and put a fresh peach in it .
champagne and put a peach in it .
peach?
yes , sir .
i never heard of a peach in champagne .
very sexy .
make that two .
yes , sir .
what happens if he has no peaches?
something very melodramatic .
lf it gets to that , i il settle for plain champagne .
marie , you really are some kinda sensational lady .
bruno , there is an old saying .
what's that?
never bullshit a bullshitter .
i want you to lay off on this clouseau thing .
take off your glasses .
what for?
then i can see what you're thinking .
i doubt that .
why do you want me to lay off him?
cos 'i asked you to .
it s not a good enough reason .
it should be .
what if i don't?
you know , marie , when i was your age ,
i used to sometimes wonder what it would be like if i suddenly found a whole lot of money .
have you ever imagined that?
oh , yes .
i even imagined that some day someone might try to bribe me with a small fortune .
what did you do?
i was tempted .
that's a good start .
but i said no .
not very bright .
i m a reporter .
for better or for worse , an honest one .
tell me why you want me to lay off clouseau .
cos i prefer things the way they are .
clouseau created a lot of problems .
a smart lady like you could find out he's still alive .
or dead .
i might even find out that someone killed him .
you've got a beautiful face .
why do you want to stick it in where it doesn't belong?
because it's my job .
what good's your job if you've gotta do your tv show from a hospital bed?
i knew you were going to threaten me , but i didn't know how i would react .
i ve surprised myself .
is that right?
yes .
instead of scaring me , you have made me angry .
i can't remember when i ve been so angry .
i am a member of the press and i will not be intimidated by you or by anybody else .
now who's being melodramatic?
melodramatic?
wait till i get home !
what are you gonna do?
faint or throw up .
maybe both .
eight to five it's throw up .
you've got a bet .
sir?
gutsy lady .
yes , indeed , sir .
great ass .
i didn't notice , sir .
arthur , there's an old saying .
" never bullshit a bullshitter .
of course , sir .
yes , great arse indeed .
bruno !
can i get out now?
yeah .
i don't think she has such a great ass .
what do you expect me to do?
arrest him .
on what charge?
he had me kidnapped .
can you prove it?
ask the taxi driver !
you said the taxi driver kidnapped you .
bruno's men forced him to .
they had guns .
did you see the guns?
no , but the taxi driver told me ...
i m certain that everything you've told me is true .
but ...
i m equally certain monsieur langlois will deny it .
monsieur langlois?
it boils down to ...
it boils down to his word against mine .
exactly !
in certain circles , monsieur langlois 'word carries a lot of weight .
you are upset so i will ignore the innuendo .
upset or not , the innuendo stands .
miss jouvet , may i suggest that you go home and forget all about this .
excuse me .
i shall tell you exactly where i am going directly to my office , to write my next broadcast about the mafia boss who kidnapped me and the chief inspector who refused to do anything about it .
in my opinion , that would be most unwise .
what it boils down to , inspector , is , i don't trust your opinion .
miss jouvet seemed a bit upset .
miss jouvet is turning out to be a real pain in the a ...
aagh !
so far the incident hasn't even been investigated .
if bruno langlois is in the mood to deny the allegation ,
i will be happy to repeat it on the witness stand .
she's talking about you .
yes .
lot of guts .
i believe even the french godfather would think twice about challenging me in court .
as for chief inspector dreyfus ,
if he really is the paragon of police virtue that he purports to be , why hasn't he found the taxi driver and interrogated him?
she's talking about you .
yes .
it s intriguing , but the more i find out about clouseau , the more certain interested parties would prefer me to drop my investigation .
so far , i haven't turned up anything incriminating , but obviously i m rocking the boat and people are getting nervous .
one thing's sure .
i intend to keep on rocking until i have an answer for you .
good night .
clouseau's residence .
cato speaking .
i've gone to miami beach to spend chinese new year with my grandmother .
leave a message after the bleep .
all?
avon calling !
you !
regrettably .
clouseau's residence .
cato speaking .
i've gone to miami beach to spend chinese new year with my grandmother .
leave a message after the bleep .
i m sorry .
i m used to it .
this is professor auguste balls of par is .
you oriental picaroon !
you can't fool me about a plane crash .
he is hiding to avoid payment .
unless i receive 4, 000 francs by friday , i'm suing .
you can put that in your opium pipe and smoke it , you conniving cantonese !
who the hell is professor auguste balls?
inspector clouseau's official disguise maker .
what's a picaroon?
a cheat .
that's great .
being called a cheat?
some of my best friends are picaroons .
i m sorry i broke in .
that's ok .
keeps me in practice .
can i get you a cup of tea?
no , thanks .
i could use an aspirin .
i telephoned before .
i really thought you'd gone to visit your grandmother in miami .
miami beach .
she runs a bingo parlour .
she's a real picaroon .
i thought maybe i d find something .
like what?
like this .
oh , that !
do you know who these people are?
his parents .
are they still alive?
his father is .
he lives in the chteau clouseau lamarque .
he's a winemaker .
swine rabbit !
mes chrie s .
beaujolais !
what are you doing?
bon , bon , bon , bon .
au revoir , mes chries .
au revoir , papa .
it doesn't taste the same since we lost fifi .
i m missing the great fifi .?
fifi !
could you tell me something about your son?
no .
after four o'clock ,
i can't tell you anything about my son .
why not after four o'clock?
because , after tasting the wine all day , after four o'clock i can't remember my son
let alone tell you anything about him .
it is a miracle that i remember it is after four o'clock .
that felt good !
are you all right?
of course i am all right .
i was just checking that nanna vacuumed the rug .
speaking of nanna ...
fetch nanna .
nanna has been with me 61 years .
she was jacques 'nurse .
really?
what?
i said " really?
i know that .
because you said nanna was your son's nurse .
mademoiselle , you don't have to repeat what i said .
i know what i said .
fortunately i am not too old to have lost my memory yet .
k nock wood .
come in !
what am i laughing about?
i m not sure i can explain it .
nanna approaches .
( whistles

my son jacques clouseau was born september 8th 1920 .
he had his mother's eyes and his father's kidneys .
from the very beginning ,
jacques wanted to be a policeman .
he had many setbacks , but he was always resourceful .
he was 18 when he entered the university and fell in love .
the girl of his dreams married another .
jacques decided that life was not worth living .
to whom it may concern .
i find life no longer worth living .
fortunately , there was a power failure .
swine lights .
when the germans invaded france ,
jacques joined the underground .
swine plunger .
after the war , he joined the police force and the rest is history .
thank you .
it's been most interesting .
it has?
yes .
it helps to round out my tribute .
what do you mean?
your tribute doesn't need rounding .
you have a great looking tribute .
he's alive , you know .
how do you know that?
he has his mother's eyes , but his father's fortitude .
i thought it was his kidneys .
that too .
a man with such fortitude and kidneys must be alive someplace .
i hope so .
i knew that .
goodbye .
au revoir .
and so , after leaving that delightful old man , who is convinced that his famous son is still alive ,
i began to wonder " is it possible?
mafia boss bruno langlois seems to think it is .
sir charles litton feels that such men are indispensable and therefore indestructible .
and chief inspector dreyfus is so obsessed with the possibility that he's on the verge of another nervous breakdown .
did inspector clouseau really perish in the sea , as reported?
or , for reasons as yet unknown , is he out there someplace , plotting his next move , waiting to reveal himself when the time is right?
i am reluctant to believe that misfortune has really struck down such a great man .
swine seagull .
we must find that woman .
here's the report .
i will apprehend this culprit within 24 hours .
agh !
ah !
now we are getting somewhere .
you !
but that's a priceless steinway .
not any more .
agh !
( phone rings
inspector clouseau's residence .
clouseau .
one moment , please .
for you .
he's sir charles phantom , the notorious litton .
the phantom?
yes .
one and the same .
my greedy little yellow pimp .
ow !
there is something that i am very interested to know .
it s rumoured ...
back to town .
follow that car .
does your dog bite?
no .
nice doggy .
i thought you said your dog did not bite .
that is not my dog .
do you know the way to the palace hotel?
yes .
special delivery .
a beum .
were you expecting one?
a beum? !
you fool !
you raving oriental idiot !
there is a time and a place for everything , cato .
and this is it .
and another thing .
i was known as the pavlova of the parallels .
oh , yes .
yes , it's all coming back now .?
ah , yes , i remember it ...
aagh !
well , that felt good .
