i believe that .
i think you become an angel in heaven .
you can play basketball all day long and score as many points as you like .

so you've had no contact with your mother since she moved to america?
no .
and she hasn't called?
i don't have a telephone .

we've received a letter from her .
do you know anything about this?
no .
why?
in the letter she writes ...
of course it's not legally binding .
you can't formally do this ...
but she writes that she renounces her parenthood .
this means that she no longer wishes to be your guardian .
guardian?
what are you talking about?
look , i really feel sorry for you , but here she writes ...
i can read it to you .
lilya has always been an unwanted child "
" and therefore i no longer wish to be her guardian .
i hereby hand her over to the care of the social services .
it's awful , i understand ...
it's awful .

sweden is a paradise compared to here .
you can really relax there .
and the people ...
even the people are different .
they're kind , not like here .
besides , you can earn really good money .
you know , in one month you can earn what a doctor makes here in a year .
that can't be true !
yes it is , really !
look at it here ...
people are crazy !
you know what my cousin did?
he sold one of his kidneys because he didn't have money .
would you sell a kidney?
you don't deserve a life like that .
what happened to the ball?
dad broke it .
broke it?
just punctured it .
why?
with scissors .
why?
i don't know .
he went crazy .
i'll fix it ...

he said you could start on monday .
monday?
this monday?
yes , this monday .

of course it is .
but it's the only one you've got .
this life is the only one you've got .
i don't want this life .
i'm not interested .
look at me .
i killed myself and went to heaven and yeah , it's really good in heaven .
but i regret it , 'cause i wanted to live on earth a little longer .
you remain dead for all eternity , but you're alive only for a brief moment .
i wasn't ready yet .
not ready?
remember that time when we sat on the bench
and you wrote " lilya 4 ever "?
and those assholes that spat at us?
i said that we should leave
but you said that you weren't ready .
you wanted to finish writing first .
do you remember?
that's how it is now .
everyone's spitting at you , but you're not ready .
jump if you want .
it's not dangerous .
i'll catch you .
but then you lose .
and the assholes that spit at you win .
you see?
hello , sweetheart .
are you back from school already?
have you got homework?
how was school today?
i hate you .
you think i'm your property?
i'm not your property .
