how can you besmirch my honor?
come !
my mission is to protect the princess .
draw .
let's both fulfill our missions .
protect the princess .
save her !
run !
your highness !
28 feb 2005 .
i had the same dream from months ago .
this time ...
i'm an ancient general ,
leading a vast army to rescue ... some sort of princess .
i fell off a cliff ...
william?
you're back in hong kong?
great !
come on over !
talk about being all at sea !
how come you live on a barge?
the research budget was halved last year .
with the project unfinished ,
i had to sell the flat .
so i moved here with my study .
it's not so bad !
pretty roomy here .
so why are you back suddenly?
didn't like the states?
i came to solve your financial problems .
can l?
i want you to do something for me .
william !
this must be dr chan .
just call me jack .
i'm maggie welcome to our anti gravity research project .
anti gravity?
this is my lab .
check it out .
let's ask dr smith to give a little demonstration .
doctor , please .
it's a well known fact that spinning an object at increased speed can reduce its weight , and we can already show the results .
these are very expensive experiments .
quite impractical , and unusable on living subjects , as no living creature can survive such speed .
thank you , maggie .
you're welcome .
i don't understand .
you're a physicist ,
i'm an archaeologist .
how can i help you?
i m seeking a breakthrough in the field of mysterious phenomena . at paper you wrote?
over 2000 years ago there was a tiny kingdom south of dasar , whose king became immortal after death .
his coffin floated in mid air . your paper inspired me .
it's just a myth .
i can even lend you comic books about this .
lots of things are called myths prior to empirical verification .
hey , jack ...
wireless telephony was a myth 150 years ago .
so was the airplane , and landing on the moon !
even 50 years ago , computer and digital technology were a myth .
many people are competing to develop this technology .
if i succeed , i'll change human history ...
this technology could be vital to our lives , to surface and air transportation , even inter galactic travel !
i know you've always wanted to do something great .
no one's ever entered this ancient tomb before .
but my work is archaeology , and i have my ethic ,
i do research , not raid tombs .
you still can't forget that incident after all these years?
something you'll never forget .
we haven't played for ages .
how's your game?
jack .
don't you practice anymore?
sure !
i just never shot from this angle before .
so why shoot?
because you passed it to me .
don't worry about it .
come on .
that maggie is your girlfriend?
no .
she represents my sponsor .
by the way , what happened to monica?
monica?
forget her .
i've been dreaming about a princess .
her name's ok soo .
i called out her name in my sleep .
how do you think monica took it?
now back to business .
jack , you've never been a stickler for rules .
you've always trusted your instincts .
instincts helped you unravel the dead sea scrolls forgery ...
jack , hey ...
jack !
jack , do as your instincts tell you .
i want to prove it's not a myth , but something real .
you're my best friend .
i trust you won't let me face danger alone .
ever tried hitting a golf shot like this?
jack !
what's with you?
i think i've got heat stroke .
almost there .
come on !
don't lie to me now .
you should exercise more regularly .
i do !
3 hours of golf each day , 2 hours of tennis ...
and another dozen hours a day playing video games , you'll go blind in no time .
if you're so fit why don't you carry me? you can walk .
hurry up .
we won't get in if we're late !
jack that's the holy man who can fly?
yes .
let's go over there .
he really can fly ...
get up .
follow me .
hey , up , up .
hurry .
give me a hand .
grab hold of my leg !
you've got strong legs .
let go !
wow !
nice stone carvings !
you have no idea how many stories they tell .
i didn't come this far on my last expedition .
jack !
the stone coffin's just floating there .
zoom in and see if it's suspended by wire .
i m working on it already .
jack , there's a sword beside the coffin .
i can see it .
i think the inscription records his deeds .
mission to qin?
this prince once brought treasures and women to qin .
the qin emperor gifted him one of his concubines , but he picked the emperor s favourite .
the emperor reneged and gave him her painting instead , as well as the qin star gem in apology .
the prince even fought a bout with qin's greatest warrior , and exchanged sword with him
hey !
don't !
what?
jack !
are you all right?
what did you just move?
i've never seen stones like these .
i want some for research .
i told you not to steal anything !
i was going to return it afterwards .
it almost costs me my life !
how come the coffin fell as soon as i pulled it out?
his majesty commanded me ... to paint a portrait of concubine li as a gift to the prince of dasar . 't smile , how can i paint?
i've not seen her smile since she arrived .
general meng !
excellent !
that's the smile !
jack !
stop dreaming !
i hear footsteps !
quick !
lift it up !
why don't you ask them to help?
jack !
help me !
hey !
let go !
who are you?
why come and desecrate our sacred temple?
what do you gain by this?
i just came in to look for something ,
i didn't mean to wreck the coffin , it was an accident .
sorry !
are you all right?
i was apologizing .
how was i to know?
i was just trying to help .
let's go !
told you not to steal !
it's for protection .
let's go jack !
look , i took the painting for you as well .
what?
run .
get them !
jack .
wait .
come on .
get up .
let's go .
get him , get them all !
jack !
didn't you say you had backup?
all i see are monkeys !
you get on board first .
jack !
pick up some stones !
it is too dangerous , we have to leave now .
come on !
jack !
fly a bit lower !
no !
we are hit !
we must go .
come on up !
jack !
jack !
go and catch him !
thank god !
concubine li !
concubine li ...
your highness forgive my lapse in your protection .
halt !
lay down your sword , or i'll kill her .
don't !
if only one can live , i'd rather it be you .
drop it !
general !
general meng yi !
don't help me ...
i'm beneath your station .
why do you risk your life for me?
a blade is forged to drink the blood of enemies .
i am like a blade , destined to fight for his majesty , and die for my country .
you are now concubine li of qin .
protecting you is my duty .
your highness has suffered a fright .
with you beside me i'm not afraid of anything .
we cannot stay here .
we must leave quickly .
lakchume ... don't be naughty .
good boy , good boy , lakchume .
lakchume?
where are you going?
oh my god .
it's a body .
lakchume , hurry up .
lakchume , pick up the body .
easy easy ...
be careful ... be careful , good boy .
how are you feeling now?
much better .
thank you .
how did i get here? you were injured very badly , the flow of the river brought you here .
where's my ...
sword?
come with me .
this way .
what is this place?
this is the birthplace of the dasar martial arts .
it has a history of 3, 000 years .
my uncle , he is a master of the 275th generation .
there he is .
i heard you made the news in dasar .
i am so sorry to have caused so much trouble . you wrecked the coffin of a dasar king !
but you also broke the 2, 000 year old myth of dasar .
for generations now , the locals don't understand spiritual training .
all they understand is to genuflect before those levitating holy men .
today they have learnt at least one thing spiritual training is not about raising your head and looking up . it is about lowering your head and learn humility and honesty .
young man , i know why you came .
this is no ordinary sword .
is it yours?
guothum .
the sword is not mine and i didn't come to fight .
i just came to find some answers
fight for your answers .
young man ... young man
now do you have the answer in your heart?
you can become one with your sword !
it must be a bond from lifetimes ago .
master , do you really believe in past lives?
which life is a past life ; and which life is present life?
what is an illusion , and what is real?
i always dream of an ancient general and a princess ,
i don't know if this has anything to do with me .
and i don't even know if the things in my dream really happened .
yesterday i saw the picture of the princess inside a tomb .
this is the first time my dream was reflected in reality .
master , i am really confused .
a dream may seem amazing and without reason , but it can explain reality .
dreams are made of your imagination and creativity , and your memories of reality .
that's why they seem so imaginary and yet so real .
because you always dream of one person , it could be a sign that ... the memories locked deep into your heart are getting released .
memories?
what should i do?
who is he?
what is he trying to tell me?
only you can find the answer you need .
meng yi ...
general meng yi !
general , come in .
meng yi ...
meng yi?
general meng yi?
you promised to protect me .
you can't die !
meng yi?
meng yi?
meng yi ...
i have nothing left in this world , not even a relative .
please don't abandon me !
i have nothing left but you .
please don't leave me alone !
general meng yi .
over here quickly .
this is the first time i've felt so free .
no courtly rites and regulations .
what a beautiful feeling !
this is the first time i've seen your highness smile .
why don't you look at me? your humble servant does not dare .
don't say such things .
don't take away this feeling ...
i'll stop calling you general .
how's that , meng yi?
i want to dance .
shall i dance for you?
no , your highness .
you mustn't .
in this world , only the emperor himself may watch .
this is a dance for you alone .
please , your highness .
we have reached the great wall .
this is entirely our realm .
our capital xianyang is just over the hill .
you are now safe , concubine li .
i have accomplished my mission finally .
no !
i don't want to go to xianyang .
take me away !
take me anywhere !
i only want to be with you !
i don't want to marry the emperor !
why did we struggle to stay alive . just to become slaves to destiny?
when will we ever be free?
not until the day we die?
ok soo ...
concubine li ... your highness , please calm down . don't forget your own mission .
you must live for the sake of your people .
only with life is there hope .
promise me , you must live !
you would have me live in such agony?
very well !
i promise you !
i'll live for you !
jack !
the police are after you !
what?
that's him !
we have to get out of here , come here , come with me .
come with me !
jack !
put it down !
put it down !
oh my god !
let's go !
this way .
why are you helping him?
did you help him to break into the temple?
you !
freeze !
wow what?
wow means you are very good .
this way , jack !
don't jump !
no !
no what?
never mind .
what are you doing?
helping you .
jack .
jack .
jack , help me !
jack , help me !
jack , help me .
give me your hands !
jump !
come on !
wait !
what?
sorry .
let's go !
along the river for two days , it will take you to china .
thank you so much .
will i ever see you again?
i will definitely come back to see you and your master .
take care .
i m levitating !
we've examined it by every means from spectroscope to mrl .
what is unbelievable is ... that its atomic spectra ... didn't remotely match any known material on earth , including the spectra measured by the icarus project .
this particular spectra was in one of the last transmissions . before the detector flew out of the solar system .
mid air coffee break !
however if the light emitted from the stone gets blocked , it would be functionless .
maggie !
don't !
hello?
jack our project has succeeded ...
well , almost !
what?
it's a meteorite?
from outside our solar system?
that's right .
we must now find the rest of them .
where's the painting from the coffin?
it's here with me .
i m going to xian .
meet me there .
bring the painting wlth you .
good , bye for now .
i m coming with you .
it's forged around the qin dynasty .
the scale like surface material is found only in qin dynasty artifacts .
looking at the design and decorations ,
i'd say it belonged to a qin general .
this is a national treasure !
be careful .
what are you doing?
the sword is ours !
jack has bequeathed it to our museum .
our foundation financed this project .
anything found should belong to the foundation .
how can you donate the sword to the museum?
the sword's a grade one national relic .
it belongs to all of humanity .
it's only right we return it to the world via the museum .
anyway what's key to the project are the meteorites .
these two artifacts have nothing to do with them .
before my experiments draw a conclusion , anything may prove to be a critical link .
how can you prejudge it by saying otherwise?
my experiments will benefit all mankind .
artifacts are old , dead things .
they have no life , no future !
what science is concerned with is precisely the future !
fine , if that's what you say , then how come these 2000 year old artifacts are so important to you?
i risked my life for that sword !
that was me !
ok !
in that case , when i find the meteorites , you'll still give them away?
yes .
as long as it's someone else's artifacts i'll return them .
no one can plunder relics from someone else's country and put them in their own museums .
they call it 'safe keeping 'but it's theft .
it's despicable behavior .
so what are we going to do now?
what can i do?
william .
do you want to meet your sponsor for the last 10 years?
of course !
but he doesn't want to see me !
i'll bring you to him now .
right now?
come with me .
i'll return these relics to dasar for you .
thank you .
professor koo?
it's you?
it's been years since i was a professor .
mr koo you've been funding my work all these years?
that's right .
i had my eye on you even before you graduated .
maggie , cancel my contract with the foundation .
i won't accept sponsorship from a tomb raiding 'archaeologist '!
and you and jack weren't raiding tombs in dasar?
i've unearthed many treasures in my lifetime , but the best ones i found are you and jack .
don't you hate him?
no .
even if he has hurt me deeply .
so what do you want from me?
stay with jack .
enlighten him .
he'll make you the world's greatest scientist .
isn't that your life's dream?
the 36th year of the emperor's reign .
star fell on eastern province , turned to stone on earth .
the meteorite was engraved with a curse on the emperor .
so the emperor tried to kill everyone around him ... to keep the secret of the meteorite .
look !
general nangong's returned !
out of the way !
report to the general at once !
how is my father?
how is his majesty?
report !
general nangong has returned with important intelligence .
well how is his majesty?
his majesty's ...
general , the immortal pill is ready .
on his way back with it , general xu was ambushed by rebels .
prepare the troops for departure .
yes , sir .
fresh horses !
yes sir !
if word gets out , your whole clan will be executed ! your servant wouldn't dare !
please tell the chancellor ,
i don't know anything .
i'll never tell !
i ... don't know anything .
please assure the chancellor ...
father had too many people around him .
i fear for our plans .
the concubines are ready to be entombed with him .
your majesty , the immortal pill is ready , but was taken in a rebel ambush . your servant begs leave to go retrieve it forthwith !
general meng , your duty is his majesty's safety you should stay ... ation is most urgent !
i await his majesty's decree .
his majesty commands general meng ... to retrieve the pill !
as ordered !
wait !
his majesty has few troops in his entourage .
if you go all out for the pill , and the rebels strike ,
i fear for his majesty's safety .
in that case i'll only take the light cavalry .
i won't tell !
his majesty still needs treatment !
let me try once more !
general meng yi !
farewell , your highness . you must come back !
the pill can save his majesty's life , and therefore yours too .
yi swears , my heart is yours forever .
i await your return .
attention , soldiers of the meng clan !
those with aged parents are excused !
the only sons are excused !
husbands and fathers are excused !
those who are excused guard the camp !
the rest of you , mount !
general !
how many years have we shared our honor?
why can we not live and die together now?
nangong yan swears to follow you even unto death !
we swear to follow the general ! ...
i have orders from the chancellor to take the pill .
failure to hand it over is disobedience , xu gui !
i can only give the pill to general meng , but no one else .
the chancellor bears his majesty's word .
obey or die !
prepare to attack !
prepare to attack !
defenses !
ready archers !
shoot !
charge !
attack !
zhao kuang his majesty orders !
yield at once !
you dare fake an imperial decree?
general meng?
leave none alive !
general zhao , general meng comes with an imperial decree !
why do you disobey? your disobedience in the field will be punished !
attack !
soldiers at the back !
no one moves without my orders !
attack !
xu gui !
general meng !
meng jie?
the chancellor wants you dead .
behind my troops is the only way out .
general , there's no time !
you go with meng jie .
i'll hold them off .
go !
after them !
out of the way !
out of the way !
my bow !
out of the way !
everyone out of the way !
go !
hurry !
go !
black wind !
archers , ready !
shoot !
shoot !
general !
take the pill and go !
general !
the pill must reach the emperor !
protect concubine li !
general !
farewell !
go !
black wind , you have done your duty .
jack .
sorry .
you were right .
those relics should be returned .
i made you something .
i hope you like it .
thank you .
i looked up the geographical data within 500 miles of xian . you once told me your dreams of waterfalls and tunnels .
i hope this will help .
how far is this waterfall from mount li?
about 200 kilometers .
sensors indicate a huge cave behind the waterfall .
there were many rainstorms one year , and the cave never reappeared since .
thank you .
good bye .
jack , there's a cave behind the waterfall . and a huge opening behind the cave .
that's right .
a dozen years ago there was a drought .
the water dried up .
the cave behind the waterfall appeared , and a foolhardy villager climbed in .
then it started to rain , water quickly concealed the entrance again .
the villager was never seen again .
what do you plan to do?
i m going into the waterfall .
how?
get flushed in .
you crazy?
that's very dangerous !
you don't even know if your dream is real !
sure !
i don't know if it's real or not , or who the person in the dream is to me .
but i can feel her love .
so you're saying , unless you unravel this dream , you'll never be at peace .
what a blessed place !
wind , water , all the elements are in place .
jack , only you could have brought me here .
william , do you copy?
loud and clear , jack .
i can see you .
i'll contact you as soon as i'm in .
but if ...
no ifs and buts .
i'll be waiting to hear from you .
i'll be in touch .
don't worry .
whether it's brain or brawn , he's your superior .
jack what's happening?
jack ...
are you all right?
my ass hurts .
william , i see an opening ... with man made designs .
like the sketches you drew?
i'll see if i can get inside .
contact you later /
get ready to begin .
now !
meng yi .
meng yi ... you've finally returned !
i am your ok soo .
you've finally come !
ok soo ...
it's really you?
you were really waiting for me !
am i dreaming?
i promised i'd live for you !
i've kept my word .
you kept yours too . you've really returned !
jack !
jack , thank you !
without you , this secret will stay buried for another eternity !
this place is exactly like jack's dream !
i can't explain it scientifically .
there are many things in this world ... ... that science can't explain .
this cavern stays warm the year round .
it's shunt off from the world but air flows freely .
they made massive constructions at mount li , but dug a 100 mile tunnel to build the mausoleum here .
brilliant !
a masterstroke of deception !
but where's the entrance to the mausoleum?
your highness !
beware !
stop !
general nangong !
he's meng yi !
general meng !
impossible !
he can't be general meng !
no warrior is general meng's match !
how can he be him?
he really is general meng !
there's no mistake !
you really are the general?
greetings to the general !
sir , i have followed your order to protect concubine li pending your return .
mr koo ...
great work , mr koo !
you've discovered the secret of levitation .
weightlessness carries grave dangers .
if we lose traction and float off , we'll be adrift forever , and turn into living fossils .
hold on !
after i left you that day , i returned with the pill .
his majesty was barely alive , but zhao gao doubted the pill's veracity .
he ordered me to personally test it .
chancellor li said ... it was our honor to test the pill for the emperor , and forced me to take it too .
and so , those who wanted to live didn't , and those who wished to die can never do so .
general , what happened that day after i left?
that day , after i gave you the pill ...
black wind , you have done your duty .
fighting by your side today has been xu gui's greatest honor in life .
i take my leave ...
halt !
attack !
attack !
surrender , general !
surrender , general !
no , never ...
i won't believe it .
if general meng fell in battle ... then who are you?
i am ...
everything is as i expected .
life after death ... ... troops in an eternal vigil ...
i've found you at last !
who'd have thought , the qin emperor would use the meteorite to create a weightless world?
general , did you bring troops?
no .
wait for me here .
careful .
who dares to intrude the mausoleum?
a qin dynasty man?
immortal? !
jack !
are you all right?
william ! you conned me from day one .
you've been working for him all along !
i ...
jack , i told you before .
greed is human nature . and desire for knowledge drives us .
i merely made use of william's greed , and your desire for knowledge .
and now my life's work is complete !
when you turned me in , i told myself , one day you'll make it up to me .
jack , all i want is to take some stuff back for experiments .
my discoveries will benefit the world .
i'll become the greatest scientist of the century !
no one can take anything from here .
this is a part of history .
it should stay buried forever !
without you , i couldn't have solved this maze ... in several lifetimes !
professor !
scoundrel !
how dare you defile the mausoleum?
the penalty is death !
nangong yan !
careful !
don't shoot !
i want him alive !
take care of ok soo .
where's the immortality pill?
tell me .
halt !
general nangong !
'when the dragon pearl moves , annihilation ensues '
pull me in .
quick , give me a hand .
general nangong !
concubine li !
run !
give me your hand !
quick !
use your legs .
right , your legs .
pull me in .
a qin dynasty deputy imperial general !
tell me !
where's the immortality pill?
where's the qin emperor's sarcophagus?
it must be in the celestial palace .
take me there !
take me there !
stay where you are !
don't you dare try to steal anything ... or take her away !
that depends on whether you can stop me .
don't worry .
i won't let anyone hurt you .
jack !
help me !
jack !
jack !
ok soo , i'll take you away from here .
let's go .
jack ...
william !
william !
help me !
hang on to me !
i only do scientific research ,
i m no tomb raider !
you must get out no matter what , and finish my research !
jack
jack , are we still friends?
jack ...
you really aren't meng yi?
no , i'm not ...
whether i m meng yi or not doesn't matter now .
what's important is that we leave here at once !
you're not meng yi .
i m not leaving .
i'll await meng yi's return .
ok soo , hurry there's no time !
no !
he's not dead !
i'll wait for him !
ok soo !
ok soo !
at last !
immortality !
six months later
