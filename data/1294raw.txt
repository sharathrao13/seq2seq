when the angels did the ... you know the airlift?
i don't know .
start with the money .
that's what our anthony says .
that's what people want to know about .
like if you're moving house ... you don't say " we're moving house and the new one has got a green door " .
you say how much you're paying .
how much you got for the old one .
mortgage .
interest rates .
stamp duty .
solicitor's fees .
how much you'll get if the new one goes up in value .
that's called equity .
personally , i think , 'so what? '
money's just a thing .
and things change .
one minute something's there and you can cuddle up to it .
the next minute it's gone .
like a malteser .
that goes in the kitchen .
is this fantastic or what?
surprisingly spacious , with attractive views .
oh , that's anthony's .
that must go upstairs and ...
and anyway , in the end , it turns out it wasn't about the money after all .
that's it lads .

damian?
saint roch , sir .
who's he play for?
no one sir , he's a saint .
oh that's better , go on .
he was so worried that he might say something bad .
that he said nothing at all for twenty years .
we could do with a couple like him in this class .
thank you , damian .
i like a lot of virgin martyrs too .
like saint agatha .
she ripped her own eyes out , so she wouldn't have to marry this man .
or saint katherine of alexandria .
they tried to kill her by crushing her to death on a wheel .
but she made the wheel explode and all the splinters killed people in the crowd .
the patron saint of fireworks .
that's where we get the catherine wheel from .
i did say thank you , damian .
right , i brought in this picture .
this is a hero of mine .
who knows who this is?
nelson mandela?
fantastic , nelson mandela .
i should be careful what you talk about .
try talking about football or something .
keep off the weird stuff .
just don't be conspicuous or you won't fit in .
aero and a yorkie please .
and five juicy lips .

i'll give you a crime number and then you can make a claim on your insurance .

i'm ...
oh , sorry .
yes?
isn't the problem here , that our houses are built on sand?
sand?
no .

if you store up your treasure on earth it will be stolen .
but if you give it away , then it can't be stolen .
mormons?
well , latter day saints .
saints?
i know all about them ...
errr ...
damian , go and give terry a hand in the kitchen will you?
you too anthony , off you go , good lads .
now , some of you are going to be burgled .
there are things i can tell you , that will lower the odds of it being you personally .
it's a bit anti social , because if it isn't you then it'll be next door , but ha ha there you go .
our mam's dead .
here .
go on , help yourself .
take as many as you like , son .
result .
is it completely honest?

what?
well ... you know ... sometimes , but this is real though .
this is real .
this is real
can't wait to tell dad .
you can't tell dad about this .
you can't tell anyone about this .
why not?
tax .
if the government find out about this , they'll take forty percent of it away .

yeah , just keep it shut .
two hundred and twenty nine thousand , five hundred and twenty pounds , minus ... a hundred quid each , spending money .

i come in on the train .
couldn't afford to live round here .
who exactly is paying for all this?

yeah we are .
no ... no , we're not .
it's birthday money .
his birthday money , he saved it .
puddings?
yes please .
no .
one hundred and sixty eight quid .
do you know how many times we'd have to visit pizza hut to get rid of all the money?
one thousand , three hundred and three point five one seven times .
it's just not practical .
we should buy property .
see this house , we could buy two like that .
if they knocked some off the asking price .
and if we did buy property , that'll go up in value .
so we'd have even more money .
damian?
excuse me?
are you poor?
beg your pardon?
are you poor?
are you asking for money?
me?
no .
because we don't have any .
we live in a community , you know , it's very basic .
we don't have a dishwasher for instance or a microwave .
and there's no cash kept on the premises .
so you are poor?
in a sense , yes .
brilliant !

but i can't promise anything .
why not?
there's plenty of you .
yes , come on welcome .
hello .
what are they singing?
they are praying for rain .
where i come from ... people have to pay a tenth of their daily income on water .
it's so expensive that they can't afford to wash their hands .
so they get disease .
you don't need fancy hospitals or medicines to make life better , just a well .
and you ... can build a well for as little as one hundred pounds .
that's fantastic !
thanks .
i'm sorry i don't know who you are .
mutual that then .
this yours?
nice .
near a railway .
what's in there?
nothing really .
what's this?
a dress .

just wait there .
five ... four ... three ... two ...
who's that?
a poor person and you said there weren't any .
i know .
but who is it?
i don't know .
just someone .
what do you mean 'someone '?
did he do anything to you?
what sort of things?
never mind .
look people are weird .
you've got to be more careful .
you shouldn't really talk to them .
anyway i've told him now .
told him what?
that we have tons of money .
he's poor .
what?
nothing .
nothing .
leave it to me .
where is he then?
i don't know .
he was here a minute ago .
see .
loads of money .
we've been saving it up for ages .
you can have it if you need it .
come on damian .
you'll have to change it quickly .
do you think that was really enough?
more than enough .
that's him completely sorted out .
right .
have you given money to anyone else?
not really .
what?
it wasn't that much .
just like a bagful .
what's that?
scuba scooter .
it goes at ten mile an hour for up to five hours .
we could have one of them .
we could have one each .
we could have a whole fleet .
she's nice .
huh !
i've seen better .
close the door .
look you can see it protruding .
what is it?
it's a nipple .
what's it for?
well it's for feeding babies .
did mum have one?
two .
they've all got two .
and did she feed us with them?
yeah , course she did .
i remember .
you can't remember when you were a baby .
i don't remember her doing it to me .
i remember her doing it to you .
anthony?
what?
i thought you'd done the washing up?
i did it !
what do you call that glob?
hello what's your name?
keegan .
alright , k , what's happened to your finger?
that's quality .
pure scary , pure scary .
hey , give me your money .
come on , empty your pockets .
hey you !
excuse me , excuse me !
give me all your money .
come on , every copper .
who feels sorry for poor children?
correct answer .
everybody sitting up nicely?
ok .
so , as you know , we're going to have new money in the new year .
does anybody know how much a euro is worth in pounds?
yes .
sixty seven p .
spot on .
here , there's a little prize for you .
it's your own euro converter .
now !
who else wants one?
anybody?
me !
ohh .
everybody .
ok .
so , who can tell me how much two pence is worth in euros?
mmm .
well i'll tell you .
it's worth not very much .
almost nothing .
to you .
but if we all put our two pences together .
then we'll have a lot of two pences won't we?
yes .
how many people are there here?
one ... two ... three ... four ...
five ... six ... seven ... eight ...
two hundred and fifty .
sorry?
there's two hundred and fifty in the school .
oh clever clogs head master .
ok two hundred and fifty .
so if you each gave me two pence , then i'd have five pounds .
it's not that much here .
but in ethiopia five pounds could feed a family for a week .
and if you all gave me two two pences , then we'd have a tenner .
and that's enough to provide that village with a source of clean water forever .
it's no good to you .
so chuck it in the bin .
excuse me .
give me all your money !
come on , every copper .
get out of my way .
hey you !
hey , give me your money !
come on .
empty your pockets .
hello , what's your name?
damian .
hi damian .
i'm the bin .
hello bin .
damian , you'll give me some money won't you?
yeah .
what did you do?
you did it again didn't you?
what?
i saw what you did .
how much?
not much .
she's nice .
i've been thinking .
why don't we give the money to her?
so how did it go?
well ...
a thousand !
what did you bring a thousand to school for?
can't you see that that's suspicious?
it's not suspicious .
it's unusual .
how can it be suspicious?
it's our money .
right you lot outside ... come on .
right , that's enough messing around .
do you know in africa you can build a well for as little as a hundred pounds .
just listen .
it was the most daring , most brilliant , cleverest and biggest robbery on record , ever .
the train was here .
the train , the one with the money ,
used notes .
right the van comes up onto the platform ... here .
it's a railway van so no one takes any notice .
until ...
they jump out of this van and some of them got hold of the driver .
some of them start shifting the money .
by this time rapid response has been mobilised .
alright , let's go .
come on !
the van drives off with a reckless disregard for life .
rapid response goes after it .
there's ... armed units .
dog handlers .
helicopters .
throw everything at them .
the train stays here .
an ambulance comes , takes the driver to hospital .
get another driver .
the cld count the bags .
there's only one missing .
then rapid response corner the van .
trapped .
the robbers dropped the lot and they leg it !
they've got no chance , except ...
newcastle united versus arsenal at highbury .
one all .
disappointing result for the gunners .
please advise car , i think we've lost them .
they don't catch the men .
but that's alright because when they get back to the van ... there's the missing bag .
how do you ... how do you know all that?
his uncle works for the police .
the van has gone .
the train is in the station .
and the cops are in the cop shop making tea .
where are the robbers?
where's the last place you're going to look?
our house?
maybe .
so the train moves off with a new driver and all the money .
on the train .
the money was on the train and so was a robber?
lateral thinking .
the money stays on the train , but so does a robber .
he sits tight .
and every time the train comes to a slow bend he chucks a sack of money out .
they've got people waiting all over the country .
could be stafford or crewe .
could be preston or wigan .
runcorn , it could be .
could be here .
damian .
damian .
calm down .
it'll be alright .
no one knows it was us .
i don't care .
leave me alone .
what you have to tell me for?
because i wanted you to know the truth .
we have to give it back .
no ... no we can't do that .
they were going to burn it .
now come on , it isn't the money's fault it got stolen .
i thought it was from god .
what?
well you know sometimes you tell people about mam and they give you money or sweets .
well i told god and ... well who else would have that kind of money?
well ... in a funny ...
god doesn't rob banks , alright .
god does not rob banks .
office .
now .
your father's on his way .
come in .
the mormons !
you stole money from mormons?
would you like to tell us why you did it anthony?
our mam's dead .
hey .
hey .
hey anthony come here .
anthony , damian , come here .
ok .
team talk .
your mother ,
she would not want you , to stand around crying or to steal things .
she wants you to get on with your lives and do the best you can .
make her proud , son , eh?
and not , you know ... cry .
ok .
so let's stop crying eh?
and stealing things .
let's stop that too .
get in the car .
don't ever do that to me again .
look .
i'm really sorry it was me .
i didn't mean to cause any trouble or anything .
no you did right .
they stole it , what could you do?
they did give it to a good cause .
i wouldn't have done that at their age .
they must be ... you did a good job .
thanks .
are you from the social?
no .
i'm just a visitor .
i go round the schools collecting for this water thing .
and try and tell them about the change over , you know .
making sure that the kids understand it .
does anyone understand it?
sometimes they are a bit confused , until i talk to them .
and then ...
they're really confused .
i'm sorry .
they're very sorry .
i've sent them to bed .
i want you to know that it won't happen again .
do you mind me asking how you came to have so much cash in the house?
it was a donation .
it was left here anonymously .
and you weren't suspicious about that?
no , we pray a lot and we thought it was the answers to our prayers .
only it has been mentioned that you spent close to five thousand pounds in comet ...
a few days ago .
digital television .
mircowave oven .
dishwasher .
foot spa .
did you actually pray for all of these things?
we were praying for comfort and encouragement .
i think we felt comforted and encouraged .
by the foot spa?
and the dishwasher .
samaritans .
oxfam .
christian aid .
for christ's sake , don't tick them little boxes .
the ones about putting you in touch with like minded organisations .
you'll be besieged man .
i'm telling you !
saint peter , died ad sixty four .
alright , don't remind us .
the money ... it's robbed .
i know .
patron saint of keys , locks and general security , man .
including up there .
i'm on the door .
is it still alright , if it's robbed?
can you still do good with it or should you give it back?
i thought it was a miracle , but it is just robbed .
damian .
listen .
one day i was with you know who , jesus .
and he went up into the mountains and thousands of people followed him .
the police said five thousand , five thousand .
everybody knows this story .
loaves and fishes .
see , i knew you'd say that .
that's what everybody says .
this yours?
it's the key to the old house .
jointed pin tumbler engineering perfection .
anyway , this kid comes up to us , about your size ,
his name was ... no i have forgotten .
i still see him sometimes .
anyway he comes up with these loaves and fishes .
sardines .
and jesus blesses them and passes the plate round .
now the first person he passes it to , passes it on .
he doesn't take anything .
he just passes it on .
do you know why?
because he had a piece of lamb hidden in his pocket .
and as he is passing the fish , he sneaks a bit of meat out and pretends he's taken it off the plate .
do you see what i'm saying?
and the next person exactly the same story .
every single bastard one of them has their own food .
and every one of them is keeping it quiet .
looking after number one .
but as that plate went round with the sardines on
they all got their own food out and started to share .
and then that plate went all the way round
and back to jesus and it'd still got the fish and the loaves on it .
i think jesus was a bit taken aback .
he says , 'what happened? '
and i just said 'miracle '.
and at first i thought i'd fooled him .
but now i see it was a miracle , one of his best .
but this little kid had stood up and ...
everybody there just got bigger .
do you understand what i'm talking about?
not really .
i'm talking about you .
now i'm really lost .
you're trying too hard .
that kid he wasn't planning on doing a miracle .
he wasn't planning anything , except lunch .
something that looks like a miracle turns out to be dead simple .
but what am i going to do with all this?
i just want to be good .
look i can't say too much about this , because of that whole free will thing .
right?
but ...
see this key?
keep it safe .
alright?
and i'll have a word upstairs ...
see if i can get somebody on your case more permanent .
it's three days left to e day , my true love said to me .
convert your change or donate to charity .
huummmmm , marvellous .
there are just three days left to e day .
remember the money in your bank account has already been converted .
the easiest way to change any cash you have is to pay it into your account .
the sterling becomes euros the moment it's paid in .
and if you don't have an account , why not open one today?
can i help you at all?
we'd like to open a bank account .
is your mum and dad with you?
no .
well i need an adult signature .
i need proof of who you are .
oh we thought of that .
leisure pass .
i'm afraid you're going to have to ask your mum to come in .
this isn't enough .
just ask your mum to come in .
we can't .
why not?
our mam's dead .
there's two free euros in here
and you can keep the rest of your money in it .

anthony .
why don't we give the money to the lady with the bin?
it's not ours and we're never going to spend it all .
she could do good with it .
we just gave her a grand and look at the trouble it caused .
and if we gave her two hundred we'll end up in jail .
we're on our own now damian .
don't let me down .
hello .
the speaker went on the bin .
your dad said he'd fix it .
so i said i'd cook for him .
so you get a decent meal for once .
i'm a fantastic cook .
aren't i a fantastic cook , damian?
the size of that school bag .

you'd be a lot less frustrated if you went on yourself .
damian , tell him to go on .
you'd like to have a million pounds wouldn't you?
it's not a million pounds .
it's a million euros .
that's only about ...
six hundred and twenty three thousand , one hundred pounds at today's prices .
at least somebody has been listening .
told you it was york .
jim , i'm so sorry the answer is york .
we're supposed to go to bed when this is finished .
yeah right , go to bed .
but you're supposed to read us a story .
i'll get off .
i'll see you out .
i'll see you out too .

sucker for women .
sucker for men .
don't forget i want to see that nativity play .
your dad'll forget .
go and get your pyjamas on .
they're good lads .
nice to have someone to talk to once in a while , though .
yeah .
thanks .
i had a great evening .
i know what she's after .
we can't leave it here .
we're going to have to keep it with us ... all the time .
fill your school bag .
and don't let it out your sight .
guard it with your life , whatever happens .
ok?
ok .
damian?
have you any room?
have you any room?
no , damian ,
damian he's tired , he's walked here all the way from nazareth .
he's tired .
he's very , very tired .
well ...
tired .
the walk from nazareth , people did that all the time .
and he was a carpenter .
so he was very fit .
he wasn't tired .
he was excited .
his wife was going to have a baby .
they weren't expecting to go to sleep .
ok .
you say excited .
i say tired .
let's try nervous?
ok?
shall we start again?
joseph the worker , first century , dates uncertain?
i wouldn't have said nervous .
i would have said focused .
well , have you any room?
what did he want to bring her for?
you invited her .
beginners .
beginners positions .
damian , come on .
the word went out from julius caesar .
caesar ...
caesar augustus that everybody had to go to their home town to be taxed .
so mary and joseph set out for bethlehem .
# little donkey , # little don .
key .
# on the dusty road ...
do you know how much a piece of gold that big would be worth at today's prices?
a lot .
an awful lot .
i wonder what happened to it?
because he was poor after that .
i wonder what he spent it on .
can we please loose the anachronistic bag?
i don't think they had addidas in the first century .
far away to the east , three wise men saw a star .
thanks girls .
look a star !
let's follow it .
# come , they told me , # par um pa pa pa pum
# a new born king to see , # par um pa pum pum
no , saint maureen .
i don't think i have heard of her .
is she a virgin martyr?
i don't think so .
here he is .
he's always got those bags with him .
pom pom pom ...
do you remember me?
mmmm ...?
i'm the poor man .
damian cunningham , what are you doing there?
come on , where should you be?
where should you be , you should be in bethlehem , come on .
i can't believe you've got ... no go back ... go back .
as for these .
what have i told you about these?
i've told you before .
ssshhhhh .
back out !
back out !
back out !
shhhhh !
back on !
back on !
they tried first at one inn .
do you have any room at this inn?
no sorry , we're fully booked .
do you have any room at this inn?
we haven't any room , but we've got a stable .
so he took them to the stable ...
oh , this is nice and cosy , joseph ... and cosy joseph ...
i said this is nice and cosy joseph .
damian?
damian?
yes , this is where our lord baby jesus will be born .
and so our saviour came , bringing peace to all the earth .
# silent night , holy night ...
quick , come on !
you stay there .
oh no the keys !
oh no !
damian !
what you doing?
dad !
come here !
oh god !
come here !
come here !
it's alright .
let's get you down .
what were you doing?
is he all right , dad?
there we go ,
what's he doing?
good lad .
well he found it !
it just fell out of the sky .
right in front of me .
i thought it was from god .
from god?
it's not really his thing is it , handing out cash?
why would god hand out ...
two hundred and twenty nine thousand , three hundred and twenty pounds .
blimey !
i was going to give it to the poor , but it was really hard .
why didn't you tell me?
anthony said not to , because of the tax .
we could keep some of it though couldn't we , like a reward?
get in .
oh !
so what are we going to do with it then?
we're going to hand it in .
all of it .
well what else can we do?
it's not ours is it?
hello?
i called round , the door was open .
i've called the police .
i thought you might have come home .
everyone gets burgled at christmas , dad .
this will be your crime number .
so you can get on to your insurance company .
of course they can't really recompense you for this .
i mean they can't give you your christmas back can they?
probably be next christmas by the time you get anything back .
i don't suppose you've got any serial numbers , security codes , anything like that?
no?
well , wouldn't make any difference .
it's very rare we get anything back .
very rare .
we know the stolen currency is around here somewhere .
that's what this is all about .
but they can't do anything about it .
all the banks have been warned to look out for anyone making any large deposits .
and of course , it's only one day or two , before they realise that the money is worthless .
what's that?
it's nothing , it's nothing .
it's just my stuff .
oh dad , don't .
oh my god !
this is what they were after .
that's a lot of money .
where did it come from?
they took our christmas .
we'll take their cash .
you can't keep it .
you're going to keep it?
it belongs to the government .
they were going to burn it .
they were going to burn all this money , that's a crime if you ask me .
definitely .
but stealing is wrong .
if you steal something , you have to steal it from somebody .
who would we be stealing it from?
it's not right !
damian , my house has just been ransacked .
i work every second god sends just to cover the mortgage , to give you a decent home .
and now it's been wrecked .
i am owed this .
but da ...
go to bed .
now !
do you want a story?
it's wrong .
who says?
god .
yeah , well .
yeah , well what?
don't you want to go to heaven?
look around you , damian .
we're on our own .
no one is smiling down on us damian .
no one is is looking out for us .
so we're looking out for ourselves .
but mam ...
is dead .
she's dead , damian .
you'll never see her again .
and neither will i.
and the money , is ours .
we'll take it to town tomorrow and change it and spend it , do you hear me?
all of it , because it's ours .
i know you've got it .
it's mine .
and you're going to change it tomorrow .
and that's a good thing .
ok?
when you come back .
i'm going to call you on this phone .
open the front door .
let me in .
and we'll take the money .
and you won't have to worry about it any more .
understand?
you make sure your phone's switched on .
... fifteen .
you take one side and we'll take the other and then swap .
all right .
ok change what you can and what you can't change spend .
have a ball !
you do realise , you just kissed goodbye to the money .
come on let's get cracking .
she's going to run off with it , you must know that?
come on !
how can she , she's got damian?
she'll kidnap him , hold him to ransom for the rest of the money .
no , anthony , that's what you'd do .
come on .
ok , you wait here all right?
it's mine .
we'll have to change more than this .
no !
what?
that's the whole point , do it in small amounts and no one will be suspicious .
look at the queue .
look at the time .
we'll be lucky to get round three banks at this rate .
you'll be lucky to stay out the jail .
go on !
what?
it's just quite a lot in the circumstances .
it's five thousand quid .
it's the front half of a ford fiesta .
is this a bank or a sweet shop?
what?
i need a wee .
tell her that .
can i use your loo?
well i'm not sure ...
well i'm not queuing up again , the poor kid's been in here half an hour .
you must have a loo?
what do you do when you need to go?
ok , just this once .
you'll have to go here .
i don't really need one .
you little belter .
i just can't see why it's so difficult .
i need a wee .
it's the front half of a ford fiesta , as far as i'm concerned , that's ...
i need a wee .
i need a wee .
today's the day , that britain enters a new currency era .
you must spend or bank any remaining old money today .
it's now or never .
use it or lose it .
at midnight tonight , it's euros only for british business .
well if you say so for business ... business is ... now what was your name .
what?
i've got an idea .
what?
dollars .
change it into dollars now and change it into euros whenever .
actually once all the excitement's over the euro will most likely drop in value .
so we'll probably get a better exchange rate this way too .
what?
where did i get you?
they've got a bank in there .
it stays open late .
you know everything , you do , don't you?
yeah .
what's wrong?
how did you know about the bank?
is this where your mum worked?
in here?
well stay there then .
you'll be alright .
i'll come straight back for you .
i'll do this one .
ok?
don't look .
this is where your mum used to work .
nice .
best get a move on , huh?
go on .
damian?
what you doing?
hey , what's up?
did you think i'd run off and left you?
did you?
well i didn't , did i?
no , you didn't .
the bank's upstairs .
it's closed .
and i've had a much better idea .
come on .
let's go and stuff our faces .
oh i could have had my eye out .
where are the glasses?
damian , wants to give his to the poor .
do you?
of course they won't be poor anymore , once you've given it to them .
what'll do you do then , take it back?
speaking of which ...
right mystery activity ... champagne . ... follow me .
a woman opens the door in her nightie and i thought funny place to keep a door ...
this is your fault this .
what is?
you don't even know , do you?
you brought her and you don't even know .
what are you on about?
can you hear them laughing?
even he's laughing .
listen .
very good .
once she's got what she came for , she'll piss off again .
then he won't be laughing will he?
it will all start again like when mam died .
he'll be angry ...
maybe ... she , you know , she won't , she'll stay .
oh great !
much better .
is that what you want?
her in there with him instead of mam?
why are you angry with me?
because you did it .
you and your weird stuff .
chucking money away .
talking to yourself .
seeing things .
i don't .
i mean maybe i do , but ...
and me !
sticking up for you .
for what?
the truth is , you're a loony !
don't say that , anthony .
please don't say that !
you're just a fucking loony and you should be locked up .
be at the front door with the money in ten minutes .
damian !
we were ...
i was just ...
dad , don't answer it .
dad don't .
what is going on .
please !
see this little girls .
my girls .
these girls santa claus forgot .
you're our last hope .
we haven't got a heater home .
because no point going back if you don't help ... took it out .
just ...
who is it?
excuse me please .
wheelchair like these need your help .
fifty percent of families with a chronically ill child , break up .
you're maybe asking yourself why these waterloo station need friends .
oh , let me explain .
this is a mid of night .
this is a privat time .
who are you?
get out please .
get mind .
just leaving .
go on , you and your ... get out .
come on two euro's a month ...
it's absolutely ...
would you be prepared to consider a direct debit .
just shut up , will you?
damian?
damian?
this is that same donkey as he looks after just a few months in our sanctuary .
i think you'll agree ...
all right love .
put him down .
shall we?
you'd better tell me how this started?
i've no idea .
some one must have said something strange .
digital?
yeah that's right , yeah .
how do you find it?
i'm yet to be convinced .
well you can come and have a look , when you get rid of that lot .
mmm .
one step at a time , eh?
any chance of a bit of toast?
you do that , i'll have a look around .
evening , lad .
you .
where is he?
i don't know .
ha?
where is he?
upstairs .
peaceful isn't it?
who are you?
who am i?
who are you?
we're the police .
oh .
i know you're only a dream .
but i don't care .
it's nice to see you .
even if you're just a dream .
the money just makes everything worse .
i've got something for you .
from readers digest .
here .
you may have already won ten thousand pounds .
please will you talk to me?
five minutes .
ok?
now , don't interrupt .
i'm dead .
i know what i'm talking about , ok?
you need to use conditioner on your hair .
your dad won't think of that , but it makes all the difference .
me?
you are not to worry about me .
you have been worrying about me , haven't you?
i'm fine .
anthony .
he seems to have taken it better than you .
but he hasn't .
he's got a good heart , he just ... he doesn't know where it is .
damian?
he's going to need you .
be good to him .
dad doesn't believe .
doesn't believe what?
any of it .
anything .
he mustn't do or he wouldn't .
couldn't you talk to him?
he can't see me .
oh .
is it because of the money?
in a way .
the money makes it harder to see what's what .
you know that already .
never really win with those things anyway .
you just end up with books about the building of the american railways .
it's her isn't it?
your dad and her?
damian .
you know how complicated the money was?
well ... people are even more complicated .
you need to remember that there is nearly always enough good around to be going on with .
you've just got to have a bit of faith , you know .
and if you've got faith in people that makes them stronger .
and you , you've got enough to sort all three of you out .
hey?
that's why i'm counting on you .
i haven't really been worried about you .
i've just been missing you .
that's allowed .
are you really a saint?
well , the criteria's very strict .
it's not just a case of doing good and all that .
you do have to do an actual miracle .
so ...
i'm in there .
course i am .
what was your miracle?
don't you know?
it was you .
hey?
aren't you going to say goodbye?
bye .
did you see her?
what did she say?
she said to tell you not to worry .
it's all going to be alright .
she's looking out for you
come on !
well it was fun while it lasted , eh?
look there's no easy way to say this , but i put a bit to one side , for me , to spend .
you can have it back .
dorothy , six thousand , three hundred and ten euros .
all for the best , eh?
dollars .
it's just a few grand .
dad?
ten really .
eleven thousand , four hundred dollars .
i was going to tell you .
i sort of kept them by mistake .
anthony .
i just enjoyed having a wedge .
it wasn't really the money .
i just liked having it .
four thousand , seven hundred and eighty euros .
dorothy wanted a holiday of a lifetime .
dad wanted to pay off all his credit cards .
come on dad .
anthony wanted one game boy advanced xp .
one play station three .
a shogun new bmx bike .
a rekia five hundred super quad bike .
nimbus two thousand eltro magnetic stair rider .
a table top candy floss maker .
an ipod , obviously .
an ibot obviously .
and a stamp on it hydraulic rocket capable of a attaining altitudes of over one hundred metres .
three ...
two ...
one ...
that's how anthony would want this story to end .
with big piles of stuff .
but it's not his story .
it's mine .
oh , regarde ca .
qu'est ce que c'est?
this is where i want it to end .
