it's a rehds .
could you give me a lift into town?
yeah , to the grotto .

pete told me you used that rider in a real interestin 'way .
you still plannin 'to do that?
yeah , tom .
i know not to talk you out of somethin 'you set your mind to , but alvin , you've always struck me as smart .
well , that's appreciated .
until now .
what year?
'66 .
kohler engine .
we've used it for parts but i always replace them .
the guts are good .
it's got the old transmission .
nothing fancy .
is it a good machine?
it's good .
tom , i got $325 .
that's a fact .
sounds good to me , alvin .
let's go settle up with alice .
one more thing , sometime you can find out about these old machines , if you know who run 'em .
do you know who owned it?
you bet ...
me .
all right .
i couldn't get a ride .
are you hungry?
whaddaya got?
weeners .
weeners?
weeners .
wanna try one?
here's a good stick for you .
what a hunk ofjunk .
eat your dinner , missy .
so , ... how long you been out on the road?
well , i been travellin 'most of my life .
where you from?
laurens .
got a wife back there?
kids?
my wife , francis delivered 14 babies .
seven of 'em made it .
my daughter , rose lives with me .
francis died in '81 .
where's your family?
are you runnin 'away?
how far along are ya?
five months .
well , i'm headin 'to see my brother lyle .
huh?
i said i'm goin 'to see my brother lyle in mount zion .
where's that?
wisconsin .
oh ...
just across the state line .
cheddar heads .
aren't those the dumbest things you ever seen somebody stick on their head?
i hear that's a real party place wisconsin .
guess i'll never get to find out .
there's a blanket in the trailer .
why don't you go get it?
my family hates me .
they'll really hate me when they find out .
you didn't tell 'em?
no .
no one knows .
not even my boyfriend .
well , they may be mad , but i don't think they're mad enough to wanna lose you or your little problem .
i don't know about that .
well , of course , neither do i , but a warm bed and a roof sounds a might better than eatin 'a hot dog on a stick with an old geezer that's travellin 'on a lawn mower .
my daughter rose is ...
some people call her a little bit slow but she's not .
she's got a mind like a bear trap for facts .
she keeps everything organised around the house .
she was a real good mom .
she had four kids .
one night , somebody else was watchin 'the kids and there was a fire .
her second boy got burned real bad .
rose had nothin 'to do with it but , ah ... .. on account of the way rose is , the state figured she wasn't competent to take care of them kids and they took 'em all away from her .
there isn't a day goes by that she don't pine for them kids .
when my kids were real little , i used to play a game with 'em .
i'd give each one of 'em a stick and one for each one of 'em then i'd say " you break that .
'course they could , real easy .
then i'd say " tie them sticks in a bundle and try to break that " .
'course they couldn't .
then i'd say " that bundle ... .. that's family .
why don't you sleep in the trailer?
this chair'sjust fine for me tonight .
no , i'll be fine sleepin 'out here .
lookin 'at the stars helps me think .
well ...
thank you .
woo !
what the ...?
what the hell?
hey , how're you doin '?
doin 'good .
hey , irene .
you don't think about gettin 'old when you're young .
you shouldn't .
must be something good about gettin 'old .
well , i can't imagine anything good about being blind and lame at the same time , but ... still at my age , i've seen about all that life has to dish out .
i know to separate the wheat from the chaff and let the small stuff fall away .
let's go , man . >
so , ah ... what's the worst part about being old , alvin?
the worst part of being old is rememberin 'when you was young .
> > >
can i help you , lady?
no , you can't help me .
no one can help me .
i've tried driving with my lights on , sounding my horn !
i scream , i roll the window down and bang on the door and play public enemy real loud !
i've prayed to st francis of assisi , st christopher too !
what the heck !
i've tried everything and still every week
i hit at least one deer !
i have hit 13 deer in seven weeks driving down this road !
and i have to drive down this road every day , 40 miles to work and back .
i have to drive to work and i have to drive home !
where do they come from?
oh ... he's dead .
and i love deer .
well , they sure picked the right place to practise a burn on .
that rumelthanger place was an eyesore .
< what do you suppose ...?
is that a lawn mower?
mister , you ok?
jeez , mister , you're lucky she didn't roll on you .
i guess the belt broke .
i wouldn't be surprised .
you don't have brakes on that trailer , right?
i worked for john deere for 30 years , you shouldn't be hauling a rig behind a mower .
at least not down a hill like that .
i'm danny riordan .
alvin straight .
alvin , let's get you and this rig off the road and see what the damage is .
let's get this off the road .
sure you're ok?
ok .
you ok?
everything all right?
i'm going back to the exercise .
thanks .
appreciate it .
well , ... let's take a look at this mower .
this is what '65 , '66?
'66 .
well , ... tell you right now , alvin , you won't be going anywhere tonight .
aside from your , ah , drive belt being busted , you got transmission problems .
where you headed?
mount zion .
mount zion , wisconsin?
past prairie du chien?
that's 60 more miles of hills .
that's across the mississippi .
what's in mount zion , alvin?
my brother lives there .
why didn't you take your car?
i'm not licensed .
couldn't he visit?
he's had a bad stroke .
where are you coming from?
back a piece .
west union?
hawkeye?
nope .
well , not new hampton?
you haven't come that far .
you've come a long ways , haven't you?
yeah , i have .
laurens , iowa .
laurens? !
that's west ofthe grotto .
how long have you been on the road?
what's the date?
october eighth .
five weeks .
i left laurens on the fifth of september .
you been bunkin 'in that?
that's my rollin 'home .
where you been settin 'up camp?
in the fields .
i pull off .
i don't travel at night .
haven't you been scared , being alone?
there are weird people everywhere .
well , ma'am , i fought in the trenches in world war il .
why should i be scared of an iowa cornfield?
well , um ... till we get this mower fixed , ... why don't you ... ah , bivouac in our yard here?
there's a bathroom in the garage you can use .
well , that's awful generous of you and i'm sure my machine here is agreeable to that too .
sure wanna thank you folks for helping me today .
there's a lot of rain forecast .
sure don't want to get stuck in that trailer .
i ... i do a little woodwork .
i thought you'd like a few fish .
my daughter does woodwork .
she makes birdhouses .
oh , that's nice .
you finished there?
i believe i am .
i'm in need of a phone .
sure .
come in .
i wanna tell my daughter about my recent travels .
sure .
come in .
if it's all the same with you , do you have a cordless phone?
door's wide open , come ...
i can call from out here .
here you go .
you're welcome to sit in the kitchen .
we can leave , if you're lookin 'for privacy .
out here's fine .
is the area code still 712 here?
no , alvin .
that hill rolled you into 319 .
you need to dial one and your area code .
712 , thank you .
'hello? '
rose?
dad? ... dad ...
uh , i'm ... so glad to hear you .
it's gonna cost him a bundle to fix that mower .
i don't think he's got that kinda money .
i wouldn't drive that thing to excelsior .
it's a lawn mower , for god's sake .
uh , your social security cheque?
ah ... it's here , dad .
rose , can you send me my cheque?
uh , yeah .
he's damn lucky he made it down that hill .
he could've died easily .
yeah .
he's none too strong .
see how he has to walk with the canes?
ok , dad .
i ... i ...
ok , ok , dad , ok .
i ... i have a pencil , dad . < the hillsjust get worse the closer you get to the mississippi .
go ahead and drive him , honey .
mount zion can't be half a day .
it's fine .
you're a good man , danny riordan .
and that's why i married you , despite what my mother said .
now , shoo !
dad? ...
i miss you , dad .
i love you , rosie .
'i love you too , dad . '
uh , bye , dad .
bye ... dad .
ahem .
what are you cookin 'there , alvin?
oh , i'm makin 'my mexican coffee .
ah .
mind if i join you?
get you a chair ... that iron one there .
you'll be a guest in your own back yard .
amm , i talked to the olsen twins , and , ah ... they estimate it'll cost around 250 dollars to get your mower fixed .
well , that's twice what it oughta be ,
i guess it's cos they're twins , huh?
i'd be happy to drive you the rest of the way to mount zion .
be a nice sunday drive .
we enjoy crossin 'the river , especially now with the trees in colour .
well , i appreciate that , but ... .. i wanna finish this one my own way .
try this .
thank you .
well , you know , alvin , there's a lotta hills bigger than clairmont's between here and zion .
even if you get that mower runnin 'again , it may still break down .
well , you're a kind man talkin 'to a stubborn man .
i still wanna finish this the way i started .
no , no ...
hi , verlyn .
how the heck you doin '?
fine .
wonderful .
he's there .
well ... they gave you a plate of her brownies .
yeah .
how's that for timing?
janet makes the best brownies ... in lafayette county .
she won prizes every year at the county fair .
mmm ... help yourself .
thank you .
mmm ... i've been doin 'errands and i'm heading for a beer .
i thought you'd like to join me .
well , i don't drink any more , but ...
i'm always up for a change of scenery .
well , come on .
well , i'm ridin 'a little higher and a little faster .
except when you came down that hill .
i picked up a mournful taste for liquor in france .
when i came back , i couldn't drink enough of it .
i wasn't worth a stick of stove wood ...
i was mean .
a preacher helped me put some distance between me and the bottle .
and he helped me see ... the reason i was drinkin ', i was seein 'all them things here , that i'd seen over there .
# though things may look very dark , your dream is not ... #
lots of men came back drinkin 'hard .
well ... everyone tryin 'to forget .
i can see it in a man right away .
yup .
# the rainbow , you will suddenly ... #
552 ]
there was one time ... when we just ...
were waiting for the first warm meal in ten days .
we ... thought we'd seen the worst .
we hadn't had much trouble from the air .
i was on the rise ... with the quartermaster , workin 'on more coffee for me and my buddies .
a stray fokker came over the treetops ... and dropped an incendiary on the mess tent .
all my buddies ...
the kraut banked right in front of me on that hill ... and now i can ... see the ... swastika .
that is one thing that i can't shake loose ...
all my buddies faces are still young .
and the thing is , the more years i have , the more they've lost .
and it's not always buddies faces that i see , sometime they're german faces .
near the end we were shootin 'moon faced boys .
i was a sniper .
where i grew up , you learned how to shoot to hunt food .
they'd post me up front .
darn near ahead of the lines .
and i'd sit ... forever .
it's an amazing thing what you can see while you're sittin '.
i'd look for the officers , the radio guys or artillery spotter .
sometime i'd spot a gun nest by the smoke and i'd fire into it .
sometime it wasjust a movement in the woods .
we had a scout , a little fella ... name of kotz .
he was a polish boy from milwaukee .
he'd always take recon and he was darn good at it .
we went by his word and he saved our skin many a time .
he was a little fella ...
we'd broken out of the hedgerows ...
we were makin 'a run across the open and we come upon a woods .
we started drawin 'fire .
i took my usual position ... and i saw somethin 'movin ', real slow like .
i waited ten minutes , it moved again and i shot .
the movement stopped .
the next day we found kotz ... head shot .
he'd been workin 'his way back toward our lines .
everyone in the unit thought a german sniper had taken him ...
everyone , all these years .
everyone but me .
ha ha !
see , harald ... brainiac ...
got the mower assembly free with this here little old wrench ...
you said it wouldn't work .
i'd say it worked pretty good .
wouldn't you?
so help me slide her out .
we can get settled up .
uh ... i got parts and labour that add up to $247 . 80 .
well , i'd say that's a little heavy for light work .
don't you think?
i've got an old man's eyes , but , ah ...
i'm noticin 'some new tyre here .
well , now ... ah , we got those off a resell , but the treads are good !
well , friend , are you chargin 'me for good or for new?
ahhhh ... thorvald?
ahh ... we can make an adjustment there .
well , i think the adjustment should be about thirty dollars .
is that what your pencil's sayin '?
and , ah ... about the labour ...
i appreciate that you boys have done some real time on this ... of course , a man's gotta ask when he's workin 'with twins especially a bickerin 'pair how much workin 'was fightin '?
he got that right .
shut up , danny .
if i was to judge by thisjoyous affair i saw today ,
i would calculate maybe 20 per cent taken off the labour .
anything else , mister?
well , i'm not from these parts , but where i come from ,
i would say that that was a little rich for iowa oil .
take the oil , no charge .
well , that's a splendid offer and i do appreciate it .
what's the tally?
ah ... ahhh ...
hundred and eighty even?
done .
thanks to you boys , i'm gonna get this rig back on the road .
i've drove it all the way across iowa and i'm hopin 'it holds on till i get to wisconsin .
my brother lives there .
i haven't seen him in ten years .
there's no one knows your life better than a brother that's near your age .
he knows who and what you are better than anyone on earth .
my brother and i said some ... unforgivable things the last time we met , but , i'm tryin 'to put that behind me .
and this trip is a hard swallow ... of my pride ,
i just hope i'm not too late .
a brother's a brother .
well , ...
guess i'll be turnin 'in .
i'll , ah ... see you in the morning , then , before you go .
i'm gonna leave awful early .
i wanna thank you for your kindness to a stranger .
it's been a genuine pleasure havin 'you here , alvin .
write to us , sometime .
i will .
i noticed your campfire .
i brought you some dinner ...
mashed potatoes , meat loaf .
well , thank you kindly .
i've had my dinner , but would you join me for a while?
sure .
thank you .
i hope you don't mind me trespassin '.
oh , no , not at all .
made a fine choice .
you're camped next to one of the oldest cemeteries in the midwest .
french catholic trappers .
the marquette party .
two of his men .
i couldn't help but notice the rather unusual mode of transport .
well , you're not the first person to notice that , padre .
my eyes are bad .
i can't drive .
i don't like someone else drivin 'the bus , and i need to get to my brother's .
fair enough .
where is he?
well , he's so close , i can practically feel him .
mount zion .
what's his name?
lyle straight .
is he that fella that came in with a stroke some weeks ago?
do you know him?
i work at the hospital in boscobel .
i remember him comin 'in .
caught my attention because ... he lives in my parish .
well , he's a baptist .
oh , i believe he told me that .
told me a few things , matter of fact , but he didn't mention having a brother .
well , neither one of us has had a brother for quite some time .
so , you saw him?
is he all right?
i only saw him that once and i haven't heard anything more .
well , lyle and i grew up as close as brothers could be .
we were raised on a farm in moorhead , minnesota .
we worked hard .
my mom and dad darn near killed themselves tryin 'to make that farm work .
and me and lyle would make games out of our chores .
we'd dream up somethin 'about racin 'and wagerin 'do anything to keep our mind off the cold .
lord , it was cold .
he and i used to sleep out in the yard every summer night , if it wasn't pourin '.
nine months of winter , we couldn't get enough summer .
we'd bunk down when the sun went down .
we'd talk to each other until we went to sleep .
we'd talk about the stars and whether there might be somebody else like us out in space , places we wanted to go and ... it made our trials seem smaller .
yeah , we pretty much talked each other through growin 'up .
oh , whatever happened between you two?
story as old as the bible .
cain and abel .
anger , vanity .
you mix that together with liquor , and ... you've got two brothers who haven't spoken in ten years .
well , whatever it was that made me and lyle so mad ... don't matter any more .
i wanna make peace .
i wanna sit with him ,
look up at the stars ...
like we used to do ... so long ago .
well , sir ...
i say " amen " to that .
howdy .
i haven't had a drink in a lot of years .
now i'm gonna have me a beer .
what flavour?
what does a miller's lite taste like?
there you go .
how's it taste?
it's good .
keep the change .
thank you .
it's an interesting rig you got outside .
get up the hill ok?
that hill and 200 more just like it .
how far did ya come?
from iowa .
i'm headed for lyle straight's place .
iowa !
my god , you must be thirsty . < <
<
another beer?
this will do me fine .
i wonder could you point me to lyle's place?
i haven't seen him in an awful long time .
well , you just ... ah , cross 61 here , on " w " ,
take " w " on down to weed road and then on to remington road .
on your right will be lyle's place .
if he's there that is .
how you doin '...?
not too good .
this thing'sjust tired .
is there anything i can do to help you?
well , i don't know .
itjust quit on me .
why don't you try her again?
i'm headin 'to lyle straight's place .
lyle !
lyle?
alvin?
sit down , alvin .
did you ride that thing all the way out here to see me?
i did , lyle .
