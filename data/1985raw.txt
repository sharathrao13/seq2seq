dead means they're broken?
well , their bodies are broken , yes .
and they're under the ground?
their bodies are , yes .
tell me what dead is .
mmm .
when you ...
when you look at the photographs ofthomas and timothy , do you remember the stories of what they're doing?
yes .
hmm , well ,
tom and timmy are alive in your imagination .
it makes me sad to think about them .
makes me sad too , ruthie .
but mommy's sadder .
well , yes .
uh huh .
does your son have a driver's license?
huh !
ooh !
jesus .
heh !
you don't have to yell , minty .
yeah?
well , let me consider it , will ya?
yeah .
all right .
i'll call you back .
bye .
eh , it still gets cold in the evening , huh?
thanks .
jesus .
look at this yard .
we should clear out some of these straggly looking flower beds .
i want to put in a swimming pool .
why?
oh , for ruth when she gets older .
something like the one we had in providence .
they loved it .
and the lawn ...
it ought to be more like an athletic field .
no .
look at this picture .
who is he?
that's minty o'hare's son ... the boys 'english teacher from exeter .
he wants a summer job .
he wants to be a writer .
what would he do for you?
it's mainly for the experience , i suppose .
i mean , if he's thinking about becoming a writer , he should see how one works , see what it takes .
what would he actually do for you?
mmm , well ...
i've been thinking .
i want to try separating ... for the summer .
just temporarily .
so you began your career writing novels?
yes , but they were terrible novels .
uh , unfortunately i had to write three of them ... before i realized i am not a writer of adult fiction .
i am simply a entertainer of children , and i like to draw .
edward , don't be nervous because he's famous .
he's an exonion .
his sons were charming boys ... but ... mediocre students .
why do cautionary tales for children come so naturally to you?
they were both in my class .
well , i think i can imagine their fears and express them .
um , in my stories , anyway , uh , you can see what's coming , but you don't see everything that's coming .
just pick up what you can .
note his work habits .
see if there's a method to his madness .
and ... above all ... throw yourself in headlong and just do whatever it is he wants you to do .
in my opinion , there is no better opening to any story than the opening of the mouse crawling between the walls .
i mean , the first lines ...
tom woke up , but tim did not .
daddy , i had a dream .
i heard a sound .
uh , what sort of sound , ruth?
it's in the house , but it's trying to be quiet .
hmm .
well , let's go look for it then .
it's a sound that's trying to be quiet?
what did it sound like?
it was a sound like someone trying not to make a sound .
your penis looks funny .
my penis is funny .
come out sound .
come out sound .
i'll tell you a story about a different sound .
one night when thomas was just your age , and timothy was still in diapers ,
tommy heard a sound .
did they both wake up?
oh , tom woke up , but tim did not .
and tom woke up his father ... and asked him , " did you hear that sound?
there's the sound again , " tom whispered to his father .
it's a monster ! " he cried .
it's just a mouse ... crawling between the walls , " his father said , and thumped the wall hard with his hand .
and the mouse ... [ fingers scuffling ]
scurried away .
it's just a mouse .
that's all , " tom said .
and he quickly fell asleep .
but tim , he stayed awake all night long .
and every time that thing crawling between the walls came crawling back , he'd hit the wall , and he'd listen to the monster ... scurry away , dragging his thick , wet fur , and no arms and no legs with it .
and that ...
is the end of the story .
where's mommy?
mommy , uh ...
it's her turn at the other house , remember?
it's my turn tomorrow night .
but she'll be here in the morning , okay?
okay .
" are there any mice in this house?
hmm .
everyone has mice .
mice are everywhere .
see you in the morning , ruthie .
eddie?
eddie?
mrs. cole?
marion .
come .
you can drive , can't you?
oh , yeah .
yes i can .
i know boys your age .
they love to drive every chance they get .
yes , ma'am .
but i don't know how to drive a stick .
it's an automatic .
okay .
yes , ma'am .
sorry about before .
i was ...
i was expecting mr. cole .
ted lost his license three months ago .
you're not at exeter anymore .
you can call us by our first names .
okay .
aren't you coming in?
not tonight .
did it hurt?
does it hurt much?
no , i'm all right .
i'm all right .
don't worry about me .
eddie !
it is an honor to meet you , sir .
ah .
i want to thank you in advance for this experience .
ah , well , i hope you find it worthwhile .
ed , this is doctor loomis .
eddie's my new assistant .
hi .
hi .
yeah .
exeter , '05 .
i was class of'61 .
good stuff .
so , tuesday , yeah?
right .
see you then .
tuesday , yeah .
nice to meet you , eddie .
ciao .
i've read all your novels and all your children's books ... 3 : 30?
yeah , 3 : 30 .
got it .
i've ...
i read all your novels and all your children's books , and my favorite is the door in the floor .
ahh .
well , you're probably one of the few people on earth who have read all my novels .
so , uh , what makes you think you want to be a writer , eddie?
oh , i wrote something , and i brought it with me .
i'd be extremely honored if you might read it , whenever you're not busy , of course .
well , writing is rigorous work .
i keep myself incredibly busy .
yeah .
many of my books contain 500 words or less , so ... every word must be examined and re examined thoroughly .
okay .
you're going to be spending the whole summer looking for " le motjuste , " as flaubert says .
oh .
the right word .
the true word .
" okay .
well ,
i'm prepared to throw myself in headlong and do whatever you need me to do .
yeah , because i'm sure there'll be many different tasks that will come up .
oh , all right .
for example , i need squid .
i'm , uh , using squid ink for my new book , and for all my drawings now .
there's a , uh ... a woman in montauk , she's a fishmonger .
she collects the squid ink for me .
should i go today?
ah , you can go tomorrow .
you see her husband over there , don't mention my name .
also , i have to tell you " ...
because it's a little complicated " ... you've arrived here during what is a sad time in a long , happy marriage .
uh , marion and i , we're separating ... temporarily , on a trial basis .
and i've , uh ...
i've rented a small apartment in town , and every other night one of us will be spending the night there .
uh , during the day , you'll work there at the apartment while i'm working here , but you'll sleep here .
i know it seems unnecessarily complicated , but ... it's hard to know what's ... what's best for my daughter .
anyway , your bedroom is in the main house , upstairs , second door on the left .
uh , you want to take your stuff up there , relax?
or you wanna take a shower?
unpack .
okay , well , make yourself comfortable , eddie .
thank you , sir .
and ...
i'm sorry about your marriage .
me too , eddie .
anyway ,
i'm sure you're gonna do great here .
it's gonna be a good summer for ya .
i'm glad to have ya .

woman singing , indistinct ]
did you see the shrine?
mm hmm .
it's kinda creepy , huh?
it's sad .
you go to exeter , right?
yeah , i'm an upper .
an " upper "?
yeah , like , an upperclassman ...
like , kind of like a junior .
your father's a teacher there , right?
so you get to go for free?
yeah .
he was their teacher , right?
so that's why you're here?
i guess .
did you know them before they died?
uh , no , but i heard a lot about them .
when i was in eighth grade i used to date a senior from exeter .
really?
yeah .
he was older than you , of course .
his name was , like , chickie or chuckie or something .
it was probably a nickname .
you know , it ... it's quite common to have a nickname there .
it is .
oh , great , you got it .
just in time .
yes , sir .
uh , here , wait .
just a second .
here .
i want you to , uh , put it in here and then freeze it .
what should i do next?
i'm sketching a model .
why don't you go to the beach , take a swim?
i ...
i could straighten up the work room or something else .
no , no .
go ahead .
anything really .
i just want to help .
no , that's all right .
contemplating the waves ... will be a hell of a lot more useful to you as a young writer than watching me draw .
okay .
there'll be , uh , plenty more rigorous work to do ... at some point in the near future .
don't spill that stuff .
take your dress off , please .
and your bra .
morning , eddie .
morning , ma'am .
" [ people whooping ]
" [ woman ]
bright , yeah . !
colors . !
hi .
hi .
did you just see that movie?
yes .
me too .
is that your dinner?
sort of , yeah .
i ... got kind of tired of burgers .
i've had one every night since i got here .
ted doesn't get you anything?
not really .
i mean , he would .
it's just , i don't think ruth likes to eat with me .
i don't think your parents would like it if they thought we weren't taking care of you .
they wouldn't mind , really , i don't think .
eddie , would you like to go to dinner one night?
i'll make sure you get something ... decent .
okay .
okay?
yeah .
good .
thanks .
good night .
see you .
bye .
eddie?
just one second . !
uh , ruth wanted to be sure that one of the photographs was still here .
she gets anxious if she can't see them or if they get moved .
which one was it , sweetie?
there it is .
ahh .
he's just a little broken , but he won't die , right?
right .
not yet .
no .
ruthie had a dream .
where's feet?
" hmm?
what are you talking about?
where are the feet?
sorry , eddie .
we've gotten in the habit of showing ruth these pictures , and if we don't she gets very worked up .
that's okay .
you can see them anytime .
ahh , see?
see you in the morning , eddie .
" [ ruth ]
what did he do?
" [ door opens , shuts ]
that's mrs. vaughn .
came over to discuss some sketches .
had some questions about them .
uh , guess she's an early riser .
do you want me to drive you home now , or ...
uh , no .
i'm gonna ...
i'm gonna walk .
i left the revisions on my desk .
hmm?
um , after i finish , what should i do next?
i'll let you know .
eddie , i should have knocked .
it's my fault .
i i'm not angry .
i " ...
i'm just ...
i'm just embarrassed .
eddie?
come here , please .
it's funny .
let's just call it funny and leave it at that .
eddie?
look at me .
sit .
i know boys your age .
i know it's what boys your age do , isn't it?
look , eddie , i am flattered .
it felt good to know that someone was at least thinking about me .
oh , not to assume that you " were thinking about me , um " ...
maybe about my clothes .
and i know you probably have so many girls you think about .
i didn't ...
i think about what you were wearing when i first met you .
it was a pink sweater , buttons up the front .
oh !
that sweater , it's so old .
because of how it must feel against your skin .
oh .
would you do me a favor?
take this down with you .
please?
all right .
thank you .
i'll probably be about an hour .
here .
why don't you go over the revisions?
hey , do you want your supplies?
oh , yeah .
hi .
you look nice .
the tie or the jacket .
you really don't need both .
okay .
how's the work going for you?
i just retype " a sound like someone " trying not to make a sound every morning .
sometimes he changes a comma from a semicolon , and then the next morning he changes it back .
he needs a computer .
ted needs a driver .
that's why he hired you , because he needs a driver .
i don't get to drive much at home , so ...
eddie , you're so serious .
boys your age shouldn't be so serious .
i know a joke , [ laughs ]
but it's not very good .
tell me .
there's this battleship out in the ocean , and the captain of it , captain stern , this captain learns that the mother of one of his sailors just died .
mm hmm .
and the sailor's name is midshipman abernathy .
so the captain thinks and thinks , and he tries to come up with the best way to tell abernathy that his mother died .
and finally after staying up all night , he comes up with a nice way of telling him .
so the next morning he calls the crew up on deck and says ,
gentlemen , all of you whose mothers are still living , step forward .
not so fast , abernathy .
i i like that joke , eddie .
i ...
no , it's a ... it's a dumb joke .
i do .
i do .
why don't you ask alice out on a date?
she's not my type .
well , she's a good nanny anyway .
i think it was wrong of us to have had ruth .
when we first moved here , the idea was , a new place , a new child , a new life , i suppose .
ted's a good father .
but he doesn't really know how to do all the stuff you have to do .
and i can't .
i can't with her .
i picked that one because they're in silhouette , and you can almost imagine what they would look like now .
timothy looks guilty .
thomas looks like a wild animal .
this one's funny .
tommy looks so ... scared .
i hope i'm not disturbing you .
oh , no .
no , not at all .
you can tell in this picture ...
timothy is more introspective ,
like you .
and you know where this is?
what does it say?
" come hither , boys , and become men .
not pink with lilac .
oh .
i wasn't thinking about the colors .
i don't know if they had sex .
thomas , maybe .
he was so popular .
but , timothy , he was so shy .
that's all boys want , isn't it?
yes .
before i die .
have you had sex , eddie?
no .
well , it's too hot in here , so i hope you'll forgive me if i don't wear the sweater .
you still really haven't had sex , have you , eddie?
not really .
no , not really .
but i feel ...
i feel complete .
come here .
there was a little boy who didn't know ifhe wanted to be born .
" his mommy didn't know if she wanted him to be born either .
they lived in a cabin in the woods on an island in a lake ,
and there was no one else around .
and in the cabin there was a door in the floor .
the little boy was afraid of what was under the door in the floor ,
and the mommy was afraid too .
once , long ago , other children had come to visit the cabin for christmas ,
but the children had opened the door in the floor ...
and had disappeared down the hole .
the mommy had tried to look for the children ,
but when she opened the door in the floor she heard such an awful sound ...
that her hair turned completely white ...
like the hair of a ghost .
and the mommy had also seen some things ,
things so horrible you can't imagine them .
" and so the mommy wondered ... " if she wanted to have a little boy ,
especially because of everything that might be under the door in the floor .
and then she thought , 'why not?
i'll just tell him not to open the door in the floor . '
yet the little boy ...
still didn't know if he wanted to be born ...
into a world where there was a door in the floor .
" but there were some beautiful things in the woods , " on the island and in the lake .
" 'why not take a chance? 'he thought .
" and so the little boy was born and he was happy , " and his mommy was happy again too .
although she told the boy ...
at least once every day ,
'don't ever , not ever ,
'never , never , never ...
open the door in the floor . '
but , of course , he was only a little boy .
" if you were that little boy , wouldn't you want to open that door in the floor?
the publisher thinks the drawings are too rudimentary and there are too few of them .
but , um , i'm just an entertainer of children , and i like to draw .
nudes , uh ...
nudes are a requisite fundamental exercise for anyone who draws ,
like ... like landscapes .
so you do landscapes too?
no .
long island's too flat .
you don't prefer to use professional models?
if nakedness ...
i mean , the feeling of nakedness ... is what a nude must convey , well , there's no nakedness that compares to what it feels like to be naked in front of someone for the first time .
hmm?
right , eddie?
yes .
yeah .
no .
woman singing , indistinct ]
i'm grateful to you , eddie .
oh , it's my pleasure .
it was very interesting .
no , i mean , uh ,
i'm grateful to you for being such a good friend to marion .
she's been so unhappy .
it's good to see her smiling again .
hello , cole residence .
no , he's not here yet .
should i go look for him?
unsteady?
excuse me , mr. cole .
um , patrick called from bobby van's restaurant .
he said you might want a ride home .
i have a ride .
go on home , eddie .
sorry , mr. cole .
good night .
ready , eddie?
yup .
ahh .
i , uh , converted this barn into a squash court when i first bought the place .
not quite regulation in its dimensions .
plus , uh , there's a dead spot in the floor by the back walls .
so , basically , i'm considered even by the best players on the island ... to be unbeatable on my own court .
you play much?
um , this is my third time .
ahh , well , don't expect mercy from me .
i'm gonna grind you into a fine powder .
huh !
where those red lines intersect , that's called the " t.
whoever controls the " t " controls the game .
you need to win control of the " t " if you hope to win the game .
7 love .
aah !
jesus !
you all right?
yeah , i'm fine .
yeah , it was a good shot though .
still made it to the wall .
isn't that a let?
aren't you supposed to just take the let and not hit the guy?
well , technically you're right , but i'll take the point .
can't just take the " t.
you gotta earn it .
aah !
9 0 , 9 1 , 9 0 .
you look like a boy who'll sleep well tonight .
maybe you need to catch up on your sleep anyway , hmm?
stop screaming , honey .
it's okay .
it's just eddie and me .
g go back to bed , okay?
okay?
okay .
did you get the stamps?
ah , two rolls .
they still have the ones with the nocturnal animals?
mm hmm .
anyway , i , uh ... [ vehicles zooming ]
i presume it was marion's mistake , but surely it was a mistake for the two of you to let ruth see you together .
i'm not threatening you , eddie , but i must tell you ... that , uh , you may be called upon to testify .
testify?
in the event of a custody dispute , regarding which one of us is a more fit parent .
i would never have let a child see me with another woman , whereas marion ... has really made no effort whatsoever to protect ruth ... from seeing what she saw .
and if you are asked to testify to what happened ,
i trust that you won't lie ... not in a court of law .
from the sound of it , it was a rear entry position ... not that i have a personal problem with that or any other position .
but for a child ,
i imagine doing it doggishly ... must seem especially animalistic .
i'll only be about 25 minutes today .
just a quick sketch .
i've never been unfaithful to ted .
why didn't you leave him?
ted understands me .
ted's the only one that really knows what happened to me .
you don't need some time?
aah !
what are you doing?
okay .
ready?
he starts with conventional portraits " ... a mother , a child .
then the mother , then the mother nude .
then the nudes go through phases ,
like innocence , modesty , degradation ... and shame .
mrs. vaughn?
mrs. vaughn is experiencing the ... degrading phase right now .
move your head to the light .
to the " ... evelyn , more to the light .
evelyn .
i want to know more about you .
you know too much already .
tell me about the accident .
i mean , do you know how it happened , or ... or was it anybody's fault?
marion?
m marion?
mommy .
mommy .
it was early in the morning , and mommy was just waking up .
thomas and timothy crawled under the covers .
and daddy took the picture in france .
but what did you did to the feet?
well , maybe it never happened .
you know , maybe it was just a dream .
no .
i guess it's just a mystery .
no , it was paper .
don't you want to go back to bed?
yes .
bring the picture .
it's my picture .
it's not yours .
that's true .
mommy . !
mommy . !
ow .
ow . !
she cut her finger , badly .
ow .
shh .
it's okay .
am i going to die?
no .
you're not going to die .
you're not going to die .
you don't understand .
i put the picture in her room .
it's my fault .
that's not the point .
the point is , you shouldn't have gone into her room in the first place .
that's her mother's job .
i told you , marion was asleep .
i doubt it .
i doubt " asleep " would accurately describe marion's condition .
i did it to her .
i asked her about the accident .
ah , it doesn't matter .
she was a great mother to the boys , but she's for shits now .
it's my fault .
no .
it's marion's fault .

it might be , um , awkward ... to ask for the portfolio back .
it won't be a problem .
i i don't really understand .

he wants to give them to me .
he doesn't want them?
he said he wanted you to have them .

uh , but when is he coming?
he's coming friday , isn't he?
i have the whole day for him on friday .
he knows i have the day .
will you stop?
is he coming on friday?
i i don't know .
yes , you do know .
uh ...
" did you look at those drawings?
did he show you?
my god , i'm locked out .
you're gonna have to break in .
me?
you're gonna have to carry me over the glass .
i have bare feet .
how dare you?
how dare you detest me?
ow !
you're not exactly living an " un sordid " life yourself , are you?
just ...
please , i wanna go home .
oh , go !
why did she think you looked at the drawings?
did you?
no .
oh , christ .
of course you did .
no .
i didn't .
she exposed herself to me .
jesus .
she did what?
she didn't mean to , but she exposed herself .
the wind , it b blew her robe open .
" jesus christ . !
and she locked herself out because of you .
she said you liked all the doors to be locked , and you didn't like the gardener to be around .
she told you that?
yes .
she said she had the whole day for you friday .
i can't spend the whole day with her friday .
you're gonna have to come and pick me up in 45 minutes .
make that a half an hour .
on friday morning , you're going to leave him at mrs. vaughn's .
i know " ... " for half an hour .
no .
you're never going back , and it'll take him all day to make his way back home by himself .
mrs. vaughn won't offer him a ride .
i don't expect him back before dark .
ted's gonna be really pissed off .
i read your , um ... your story .
oh .
i thought you forgot .
no .
i just didn't have a chance to get to it before .
it's not very good , is it?
oh , it's , uh ... it's very heartfelt , very ... very personal .
it's , um ...
well , it's just a collection of personal anecdotes that don't really add up to much .
it's , uh ...
i was just tryin 'to see if i could write something that seemed true .
oh , it seems true .
it , uh , just isn't very interesting .
sort of a ... an emotional outburst , but , uh , it isn't really a story .
and that , uh ... the guy , hank ... you know , the one who dies at the end?
yeah .
you need to prepare a reader for something like that .
uh ...
it just ...
it didn't seem like the way things happened .
well , you need to let your audience guess what's gonna happen ... you know , anticipate what's gonna happen ... and then you surprise them .
but , um , you have to guide them through it .
you know what i mean?
yeah .
there's a part of writing that , uh , involves a certain manipulation .
that may seem cold to you , but it is , you know , sort of cold .
i i guess .
pain , betrayal , even death .
these are , you know ...
these are like , uh , different colors on a painter's palette .
you need to use them .
also , the details ... they could be more specific , you know?
specific details , they ... they create whole scenes in a reader's mind .
not being specific , that's just sloppy .
it's sloppy thinking .
s specific details?
yeah ... smells , taste ... details .
but i'll tell ya , for a , uh ... for a first effort , it's not that bad .
you know , the , uh ...
thanks .
the prose is a little purple , a little pretentious .
thanks .
thanks anyway for reading it .
you're welcome .

you ever think about getting a computer?
be easier to do your own revisions that way , so you wouldn't need an assistant .

you should make a fist , and punch him in the nose .
if you punch him in the nose , he'll stop .
you can call alice to help you with ruth .
screw alice .
you better start to like her a little .
when ted kicks you out , you're going to need a ride to the ferry at orient point .
and who's gonna explain this to ruth?
i won't be a bad mother to her .
i'd rather be no mother than to be a bad mother to her .
that doesn't make any sense .
i don't want her to be like me .
remember , honey , don't cry when the doctor takes the stitches out .
i promise you , it won't hurt .
can i keep the stitches to show you?
you can take her anywhere for lunch .
all she ever eats is grilled cheese and french fries .
and ketchup .

60 times . " really?

of course .
this is ruth .
she's four .
what do you want from me?
just the photograph .
it's of ruth's mother .
she's in a bed in a hotel room in paris .

thank you .
she wrote her freshman english term paper on you .
shut up .
mmm .
what was the title of your term paper?
uh , " an analysis of the atavistic symbols of fear in " the door in the floor .
as you know , um , myths and fairy tales of tribal peoples are full of images ...
like magic doors and children disappearing ... and people being so frightened their hair turns white overnight .
and the vagina?
when the , uh , little boy's in the womb , the door in the floor is a ... vagina .
how long was this paper?
twenty eight pages " ... not counting the footnotes and bibliography .
but " ...
i don't suppose you girls have a car?

please .
i'll get these clothes right back to you .
i was just gonna give them to the goodwill anyway .
look at that .
phil was almost exactly your size .
oh .
you know , this is rather serendipitous .
i've been looking for two suitable subjects for a mother and daughter portrait .
something i'm thinking about for my book .
at first i would want to draw you and your daughter together .
that way , when i draw each one of you separately , uh , the presence of the other one is ... is , uh , somehow there .
how long would it take , and ...
uh ... which one of us would you want to draw first ... separately?
i should do glorie first .
first , uh ...
well , first , the two of you together , and then , uh ... then glorie alone , and then when glorie's back at college , you alone .
mr. cole , you really are an enigma .
so which are you , and artist or a writer?
oh , glorie , i'm ...
i'm neither , really .
i'm ...
i'm just an entertainer of children , and i like to draw .
what sort of drawings did you have in mind?
" [ mother gasps ]
" [ ted ]

no , no , no . !
don't " ...
don't stop .
my goodness .
wiper !
wiper .
uh , yeah .
why don't you , uh , just come in and wait on the porch .
i'll be right there .
would you like , uh , some refreshments , some water or some tea?
for the whole rest of your life , whenever you need to feel brave , just look at your scar .
your hand will grow bigger , and your finger will grow bigger , but your scar will always stay the same size .
and it will always show up in your fingerprint .
what's a fingerprint?
i'll show you .
" those are my fingerprints .
ooh .
that's really neat , ruthie .
so you were at the doctor's office getting the stitches taken out?
uh huh .
and we went to the beach .
and we had lunch .
and eddie showed me my fingerprint .
oh , that's really neat , ruth .
i see the photograph was ready finally .
we got the feet back !
look at all this sand in your hair , ruth .
you're gonna need a bath .

it's the only good writing i've done all summer .
60 times "?
okay .
let's run .

uh , i don't know .
maybe mommy moved them .
look at you .
you've got sand in your toes and in your hair and in your ears .
i got it in my crack too .
well , i guess it's a good time for a bath then .
but mommy didn't move those things .
what are those things?
they're picture hooks .
mommy moved all the pictures but not the picture hooks .
i'll give ruth the bath .
i'll take a quick shower .

you clench your fist , you punch me in the nose?
i'm sorry .
jesus christ . !
i'm sorry .
marion said it was gonna make you stop .
" marion said "?
if she thinks she's got a rat's ass of a chance ... to get custody of ruth , she's got another think coming .
she doesn't expect to get custody of ruth .
she has no intention of trying .
she told you that?
" she told me everything i'm telling you .
what kind of mother doesn't even try to get custody of her daughter?
i don't know .
she didn't tell me that .
god .
okay .
okay .
christ .
why ...
why did she have to take all of the photographs?
there're negatives .
she could have taken the negatives and had prints ofher own made .
she took the negatives too .
the hell she did .
go look for yourself .
she can't have the photographs and the negatives .
they were my sons too .
i should have half the photographs , for chrissake .
what about ruth?
ruth should have some of the photographs .
marion said you'd say that .
but she said no .
oh .
well , obviously , she went to new york .
i doubt it .
what do you know , eddie?
that's the only place she could go .
i even know where in the city she is .
i just can't imagine her goin'to new york .
you don't have an imagination , eddie .
christ .
aren't you planning on getting a divorce with her anyway?
that marion's question , or is that your question?
it's mine .
eddie , just stick to what marion told you to say , okay?
she didn't tell me to get the photograph .
that was my idea .
well , that was a good idea .
" i was thinking of ruth .
yeah .
i know you were .
thank you .
you want a drink?
no .
what day is tomorrow , saturday?
yeah .
i want you out of here by tomorrow .
sunday at the latest .
that's fine .
i just need a ride to the ferry .
alice can take you .
what about this one?
tell it !
i'm sorry , ruth .
i don't know .
okay?
i just ...
this is the one with thomas in the tall hat .
timothy is trying to reach thomas's hat .
timothy can't reach thomas's hat , 'cause thomas is standing on a ball .
timothy got mad and started a fight .
was the fight in the picture?
no .
the fight was after the picture , you dummy !
okay .
we're gonna go watch a movie .
yes .
we're gonna go .
no !
no !
we're gonna go pick a video .
yes , we are .
no !
ruthie , stop it !
no !
no !
stop it !
no !
oh , alice .
what?
what have you done to alice , eddie?
i didn't do anything .
she was crying when i first got here .
i've been asking her what's wrong , and she won't even talk to me .
where's ruthie?
uh , she's asleep .
she was crying .
i'm sorry , alice , for springing all of this on you .
fuck you , ted .
i appreciate you pickin 'up the slack .
i've spent years trying to get over my own fucked up family .
and i've done the best i could with ruth .
no .
no .
i just can't anymore .
i'm gonna quit .
i quit .
and you should have the decency to quit too .
it's ...
it's too late for me to quit , alice .
i just got fired .
i never knew you were such a superior person , alice .
alice has been superior to me all summer .
haven't you alice?
i " am " morally superior to you , eddie .
i know that much .
morally superior .
what a concept .
don't you ever feel morally superior , eddie?
hmm?
to you i do .
yeah .
you see?
everyone feels morally superior to someone .
fuck you guys .
there goes my ride to the ferry .
oh , you're a smart boy , eddie .
you'll think of someone to give you a ride .
you want a drink?
no , thanks .
oh , for chrissake .
have a beer .
jesus .
look at this yard .
cannot believe she doesn't want custody of her own daughter .
what kind of mother leaves her daughter?
i don't know her well enough to judge her .
let me tell you something , eddie .
i don't know her well enough to judge her either .
yeah , well , don't forget , it's you she's really leaving .
guess she knew you pretty well .
well enough to judge me , you mean?
certainly .
but then , she's leaving you too , isn't she , eddie?
you don't expect her to call you up for a secret rendezvous , do you?
no .
i don't expect to hear from her .
no , me neither .
hmm .
i have drawings of her .
i drew her long ago , before the accident .
she was so ... so incredible .
so fucking beautiful .
amazing .
you should have known her then .
oh , marion .
she hated to pose for me .
these are the only drawings i kept .
i was never good enough to draw marion .
i didn't know how to .
i didn't have the ability , i guess .
you want one?
you can have one .
no .
ruth should have them .
mmm .
that's a good idea .
you're full of good ideas , eddie .
wrong cubes .
marion?
jesus , aren't you the optimist?
forget the light , eddie .
this story's better in the dark .
what story?
you told me you asked marion to tell it to you , but marion can't handle this story .
turns her to stone just thinking about it .
remember , you turned her to stone just asking her about it .
i remember .
go on .
well , here's the deal .
thomas had his driver's license , but timothy did not .
tommy was 17 and ... been driving for a year .
timmy was 15 .
he had only started to take driving lessons .
it was ted's opinion that timmy , who was only learning , was already a more attentive student than thomas ever had been .
timmy studied the driving manual diligently .
he was a more patient driver than thomas .
not that tommy was a bad driver .
tommy was a good driver .
he was alert , confident .
he had excellent reflexes .
and he was cynical enough to assume ... as ted had instructed him ... that every other driver is a bad driver .
who taught to you drive , eddie?
um , my dad .
well , good for him .
tell him for me , he did an excellent job , would you?
okay .
keep ...
keep going .
we were out west , actually , and it was after a long day of skiing .
it was snowing " ... a wet , thick snow .
at 17 and 15 , respectively ,
thomas and timothy could ski the pants off their parents .
that day , in fact , ted and marion had retired to the bar at the ski resort ... where they were waiting for a very long time ... for thomas and timothy to finish their last run ... and the last run after that .
i get the picture .
you were drunk .
well , that , uh ... that was one aspect of what would become trivial ... in the ... area of the ongoing argument between marion and ted .
i mean , marion said that ted was drunk , although in his view , he wasn't .
marion , while not drunk , certainly had had more to drink than she was accustomed to .
besides , tommy had not been drinking .
he had his license .
there was no disagreement as to who among them should be the driver .
and , brothers being brothers ,
timmy sat beside him in the passenger seat .
and as for the parents ,
ted and marion ... sat in the backseat .
ted and marion began to quarrel ... about the best route back to the hotel .
there was gonna have to be a left turn no matter how tommy did it .
so , tommy moves into the center lane .
it's , um , a turning lane .
it's not a passing lane .
he puts on his blinker , not knowing that both lights are covered with wet , sticky snow ... that his father failed to clear off at the same time his father ... failed to clear off the rear window .
any cars coming up from behind tommy's car can't see the directional signals or ... the brake lights or the tail lights .
the car is not visible , or it's visible only at the last second to any ... anyone approaching from behind .
and then , the interior of the car is filled with light .
" it's the headlights from the car " coming up from behind .
" [ no audible crash ]
the snowplow cut the car almost perfectly in half .
tommy was killed by the steering column .
crushed his chest .
died instantly .
and ted ... was trapped in the backseat for all of 20 minutes .
he ...
he couldn't see tommy , but he knew he was dead because marion could see him .
she couldn't see timmy .
he was directly in front ofher .
ted , however , could see that timmy was still breathing .
ted could also see that the snowplow , as it cut the car in half , also cut timmy's left leg off at the thigh .
timothy cole bled to death of a severed femoral artery .
marion knew that tommy was dead , but only that timmy had been carried from the wreckage , hopefully ... to the hospital .
and then marion , she sees timmy's shoe in the wreckage .
" oh , look .
timmy's shoe .
he's gonna need his shoe .
and she walks over to it , reaches down to pick it up .
ted ...
ted wanted to stop her .
talk about turned to stone .
i couldn't move .
i couldn't even speak .
and that was when ted allowed his wife to discover ... that her younger son's shoe was attached ... to a leg .
and that was when marion realized that timmy was gone ... too .
and that ... that is the end of the story .
i hired you , eddie , because you look like thomas .
i gave her you .
see you in the morning , eddie .
it's eduardo .
what's eduardo doing here?
i don't know .
maybe mrs. vaughn hired him to kill you .
no , no .
not ...
not eduardo .
you don't see her out there anywhere , do you?
she's not in the cab or in the back .
maybe she's lying underneath the truck .
i'm being serious , for chrissake .
so am i.
why ...
why don't you go out there and , um , see what he wants?
not me .
i've been fired .
oh , for chrissake .
what?
wha ...
at least go with me then .
i can't go out there alone .
mrs. vaughn fired me .
eduardo , eduardo , eduardo .
let me make sure i understand you .
you think you saved my life , and this cost you your job?
yes , i did save your life , and it did cost me my job .
well , eduardo ,
i play squash regularly , and i'm pretty fleet of foot , um , but i do ...
i do appreciate your brave warning .
how much money are we talking about exactly?
i'm not here for a " hand down , " mr. cole .
i was hoping you might have some work for me .
ah .
let me ...
let me show you where i want to put a pool .
i want , uh , more lawn , like an athletic field , you know?
just , uh , pretty big .
you want some lines painted on it?
no , no .
just the size of an athletic field .
wow .
that's a lotta lawn .
a lotta mowin '.
all right .
and a lot of fertilizers .
yeah .
well , whatever you say .
i'm putting you in charge .
thank you , mr. cole .
what about your wife?
what about her?
oh , uh , does she work , or what does she do?
yeah , sure .
sure , she works .
she cooks , she look after our children .
mmm .
maybe , uh ...
maybe she'd like to clean my house .
or maybe she'd like to cook for me and , uh ,
look after my daughter , ruth .
sure .
i'll ask her .
yeah?
good .
good .
excellent .
gotta do something about these straggly flower beds too .
oh .
you can start today , eduardo .
you can begin by taking my former assistant to orient point , hmm?
sure .
i can do that .
uh , immediately .
before breakfast , huh?
yes , sir .
yes , sir .
well , you're a fairly good driver , eddie .
about marion , there's another thing you should know .
even before the accident ...
i mean , even ... even if there had never been an accident , she still would be difficult .
i don't believe it .
about the shoe , it was a basketball shoe ... an " airjordan , " i think he called it .
specific details , eddie .
specific details .
