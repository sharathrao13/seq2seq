i understand you can lose keys .
you can lose your wallet .
how do you lose a plane?
reese , what do you want me to do?
we got three out of four planes in .
that's a lot of coke .
now , that's the kind of winning attitude that'll take this enterprise to the top .
in all fairness , reese , it wasn't his fault .
are you his attorney?
why are you in the conversation?
come on , i'm kidding !
i'm just kidding with you .
he loves to joke .
terrence here is absolutely right .
i mean , hell , three out of four ain't bad .
let's celebrate .
who wants a beer?
great !
okay .
baby !
coke .
it costs money .
planes .
they cost money .
this yacht , this perm , my kid's braces , it all costs money .
do you think kitty's free?
kitty , turn around .
turn around !
reese , please put the gun down .
now , the next time that a plane goes down , you better be on it .
will you do my back , please?
sure .
i don't wanna tan weird .
am i tanning weird?
no .
honestly .
you're bronzing .
there's no such thing as a petty crime .
no minor infractions .
there's only the law .
freeze !
bay city p. d. !
that's me in the leather jacket and tight jeans .
see that guy i'm chasing?
i hate him .
and i'll do everything in my power to stop him .
wanna play , let's play .
because it's my job to stop him .
goddamn !
and the city pays me a damn good salary to do my job .
besides , he crossed the line .
and in bay city , when you cross the line ...
... your nuts are mine .
i said , freeze !
my name is david starsky , and i'm a cop .
if you can't beat them , join them .
no !
no !
no !
put the money in there .
crime .
not me , though .
i'm looking out for " numero uno .
hey , old timer .
put this on dallas .
come on !
let's go !
i'm just a realist , that's all .
and besides , you have any idea how little the city pays us?
freeze !
bay city p. d. !
take it easy .
guys , come on .
i'm undercover here .
my name is ken hutchinson , and i'm a cop .
where did they come from?
jesus christ , starsky .
you fired three rounds into a crowded intersection .
we got a man with a broken hip ... ... and some asshole wants a new top for his caddy?
that purse had $ 7 in it .
okay , want my badge?
here , take it .
fine .
come on .
i was just making a point .
david , david .
your mother was one of the finest cops bay city ever seen .
twenty two years on the force with the same partner .
you have had 12 partners over the past four years .
she died a legend .
i am not my mother !
i'm sorry .
detective hutchinson is here .
send him in .
have a seat .
how you doing , captain?
i believe you two know each other .
yeah , a little bit .
how you doing?
yeah , right .
hutch .
you've got a lot of explaining to do .
i know .
look , i was trying to infiltrate one of the east side gangs ... ... and work my way up to the big fish .
it's simple .
you were robbing a bookie .
that's right .
you've robbed seven bookies .
you haven't filed a report , turned in any money or arrested anybody .
how can i?
they'll know i'm a cop .
i wouldn't worry , you won't be mistaken for a real cop .
oh , really?
why don't you go get yourself another perm and let the grownups talk .
my hair is naturally curly .
no , it's not .
yes , it is .
that's a perm job , all the way .
touch it !
hey !
why are you touching him?
jesus !
you know something?
you two deserve each other .
make nice .
you're partners .
you're crazy .
no , i'm not .
i don't know why you're so upset .
the guy cost us 200 grand .
a " thank you " might be more appropriate .
who cares about 200 grand?
what if they link us to the murder?
they won't link us to the murder .
you don't know that .
will you let it go , please?
jesus .
take a lude .
calm down .
i did , and i'm still pissed .
okay , fine .
fine , fine .
look , i'm sorry , all right?
i promise , i'm not gonna kill terrence again .
now , pull it together .
let's go .
gentlemen , i apologize about the delay .
but i promise you what we have is worth the wait .
it looks like cocaine .
that's because it is cocaine .
with a twist .
you see , we've managed to find a way ... ... to alter the cell structure of the coca plant ... ... giving it a heightened perfluoralkylation process ... ... creating a new kind of diazomethane .
gets a little complicated after that .
excuse me .
so do you get extra high or what?
actually , it has all the same effects as regular cocaine .
well , if it's the same , why are we here?
canis familiaris " .
the german shepherd .
its nose has over 220 million scent receptors .
it can detect smells that even the most advanced technology in the world cannot .
lvan , search !
lvan , stop !
what do you got?
you holding?
he brought old coke .
this is new coke .
as far as a dog's concerned , there's nothing there .
100 percent undetectable cocaine .
got no coke smell ... ... same coke ride .
tastes kind of sweet .
if this shit wasn't illegal , guys , we'd be up for the nobel prize .
our initial run pumped out two tons of this stuff ... ... and it'll be available in about three weeks .
you boys know who to call .
ivan !
you don't understand .
they're not like you .
they're criminals .
look , i know we all got to make living .
but these guys , they are dealing hard drugs right in front of my shop .
i can dig what you're saying , mr. chowdury .
i wanna thank you for coming in today .
of course .
those gentlemen you speak of , they'll no longer be a problem .
you have my word .
this is my neighborhood .
people tend to forget that .
bee bee , make sure he gets home safely .
yeah , boss .
thank you very much , huggy .
you are a great man .
begone , little indian .
let's go , little man .
come on .
taking up time .
this neighborhood is in need of some help .
it's cold blooded , daddy .
who's next?
you got hutch waiting outside .
what you got my man waiting outside for?
he brought some extra fuzz with him .
so what?
you go get him and get him in here now .
you've never run an errand on the clock before?
i take care of my personal business after work , when the taxpayers aren't paying me .
give me a break .
you've never stopped to buy a cup of coffee?
i bring a thermos .
okay , hutch .
he'll see you now .
wait here , i'll be back in five minutes .
second door on the right .
how you doing?
hi , hutch .
hey , look what the wind blew in .
huggy bear .
hey , i want you to meet my new partner , david starsky .
hey , how you doing?
hey , nobody touches the bear .
have a seat .
hutch , the usual?
you know it .
make it a double .
get my boy a jack and tab .
and double that .
you got it , boss .
i'll get a seltzer with lime , if you got it .
i don't got it .
or not .
it's cool .
i'm good .
i just came by to apologize for what happened in chinatown .
let me tell you , i was as surprised as you were .
don't sweat it , baby .
i wasn't surprised .
you know i ain't never surprised .
hey , champ .
you got a permit for that weapon you're carrying?
starsky , please .
no , i don't .
yeah , me neither .
i'm sorry , did i say something that was funny?
stop it .
he's kidding .
no , i'm not kidding .
i wanna see permits or i'm taking those weapons .
slow up , man .
around here , we govern ourselves .
think of us like luxembourg .
you dig?
no , i don't dig .
see , luxembourg's a constitutional monarchy ... ... a sovereign state established after the treaty of vienna .
technically , it's a part of europe .
but in reality , they govern themselves .
like us .
just like us .
all right , enough , okay?
shit !
hold up !
hold up !
just chill out !
chill !
watch yourself .
oh , no .
hell , no .
you okay?
what happened?
did he shoot corky?
your boy shot his tail off .
he lost his tail?
you should keep it in a terrarium .
man , what the hell is a terrarium?
what's a terrarium?
it's an artificial ecosystem designed to simulate corky's natural habitat .
well , i can dig that .
but i say we shoot him in the ass .
oh , hell , yeah .
an eye for an eye .
take it easy .
huggy , help me out here .
slow up , fellas .
an iguana can lose his tail and grow it back .
he regenerates .
that's how he escapes his predator .
it's true .
it's a defense mechanism .
i read it in a magazine .
so him shooting corky's tail off and us shooting him in the ass ... ... it really ain't the same thing .
no , the punishment don't fit the crime .
and besides , it was an accident , right?
right .
so we're cool .
we're always cool , breeze .
lower your pieces .
good morning , bay city , you are tuned in to kba y , 93 . 3 on your dial .
this next tune is number eight on the charts and number one in our hearts .
hey , hutch !
oh , there he is .
what's going on , willis?
same old , same old .
so how's life at the clink treating you?
it's not that great .
i got some new tight ass partner that they stuck me with and then ...
i don't know .
hopefully ...
it's probably not gonna last that long .
so got that $20 you owe me?
20?
willis , i thought it was 5 .
hutch , that was my grandmother's birthday money .
come on , give me a break , okay?
i just told you i got a new partner .
stuff isn't great for me down at the precinct .
you know , back off for a second .
can i get it to you on thursday?
fine , but no later than thursday .
no later than thursday .
word of honor .
cute little kid .
it's 10 : 00 .
you're late .
i've been here since 8 .
8 : 00?
i didn't know this place opened at 8 .
well , don't sweat it , because crime called in sick .
it's gonna get a late start too .
crime called in sick , " i like that .
so , what's on the agenda today?
same as every day .
finding bad guys , bringing them down .
great .
take my car , right there .
that?
yeah .
what the hell is that?
it's like a camper/ pickup truck .
what's the matter?
we're undercover .
that thing sticks out like a sore thumb .
you think so?
you're in for a treat .
it's not that bad .
man , your stock just went up in my book , my friend .
pop the hood .
let's see what you got under ...
hotshot , what do you think you're doing?
this is a ford gran torino , okay?
it's not some crappy camper/ apartment .
there are rules .
okay , okay .
you do not bang on the hood .
you never , under any circumstances , drive .
you will not put your coffee mug on the roof .
okay?
no coffee in the car whatsoever .
coffee on the ground , you get in the car , we go .
attention , all units .
we've got a 61 40 at bay city marina .
oh , no .
this is zebra 3 .
we're on it .
hang on .
you gotta be kidding me .
no way .
what?
floater .
nothing harder to solve than a floater .
no prints , body's usually bloated ... ... it's next to impossible .
all right , i say we push it out ... ... hope the current takes it to the next precinct .
what?
you'll thank me for this one .
hey , seriously , stop it .
the key is not to pop it .
hey .
you gotta be very ginger .
what are you doing?
i said , drop the stick .
you point a gun at me?
okay , fine , have it your way .
knock yourself out .
what are you gonna solve , anyway?
i'm gonna solve a murder .
monday , june 3rd .
male caucasian body , apparently dumped from the bay bridge .
actually , there's no sign of impact , so he was probably just dropped out at sea .
could you please not talk while i'm recording?
thank you .
all right , i'm just gonna call in the meat wagon , all right?
looks like you punched your last ticket , " amigo " .
i'm sorry , did you just tough talk a dead body?
i lost my flow .
zebra 3 to base .
" dispatch .
go ahead , zebra 3 " .
we're gonna need a coroner notification .
we got a db down at municipal jetty .
10 4 , will inform .
tell them to bring a body bag and some galoshes .
he's a wet one .
copy that , starsky .
found a wallet .
nothing in it .
medium rare , okay?
you got it .
look at all these cops .
you wanna eat here?
it's a great place .
pop's?
come on .
if you're one of the cops , eat at pop's .
okay , hot stuff .
" zebra 3 .
2 " " 11 in progress , please respond .
go for starsky .
" hurry , starsky .
we got two perps holding up a gumball machine on 5th street .
let's go .
a gumball machine?
lethal force if necessary !
very funny , manetti .
hey , it's captain and tennille .
that means one of you would actually have to make captain .
radio's for police business only .
that's true .
why'd they give you one?
let's get out of here .
not that funny .
that manetti really thinks he's something .
but you know what?
he's not .
take it easy .
you think that's funny?
no , no , i mean , you just gotta rise above it .
what do we got in the wallet?
not much .
driver's license , couple receipts .
no cash whatsoever .
reese feldman corporation .
what do you call that?
terrence meyers .
that name does sound vaguely familiar .
isn't he part of our nearly there program?
i think he is .
terrence meyers .
baby , isn't he the guy dating a bay city kitty?
remember?
we were joking about it .
really?
bay city kitty .
you mean the cheerleaders .
you happen to remember her name?
no , i don't .
can i get you boys anything else?
we're good .
thank you so much , honey .
that's my angel .
i love her .
a second ago you mentioned the nearly there foundation .
what is that?
that's a program that we set up to help ex cons get back on their feet .
their parole requires them to have a job .
the catch 22 ... ... is not that many people are excited to hire a felon .
those poor ex cons , they can't catch a break .
no , it's a vicious cycle they get caught up in .
did you see the article in " the new times "?
bet your ass i did .
i love that writer .
but i'd be lying if i didn't say that we get some pretty good tax breaks too .
there it is , the kicker .
just a perk .
this sly dog here .
what do you got?
tickets to our annual fundraiser .
be my guests .
no , we can't accept gratuities .
it's against policy .
these don't look like gratuities , they look like tickets .
i'd be happy to accept .
hey , what about terrence?
is he in some kind of trouble?
he's dead .
his body washed up in the marina this morning .
oh , no .
punched his last ticket , " as they say .
you know , you try to do all you can for these guys , but it's just never enough , is it?
no , i guess it isn't .
when was the last time you saw him?
the last place i saw ...
this is a nice boat .
reese , is this yours?
actually , that's a yacht .
i'm sorry , a yacht .
excuse me , hutch .
can we please focus on the investigation?
sure .
thank you .
i could use another one of these .
right on !
that was great , girls !

you're awful .
so , what brings you around here , officers?
well , you know , that depends .
yeah .
either of you two know a terrence meyers?
oh , yeah , heather dated him .
oh , yeah .
the girl over there with the yellow top .
but they split up .
we haven't seen him .
let's go ask heather some questions .
thank you .
be careful with those moves .
you could hurt someone .
oh , that's why we practice .
actually , i was talking about us .
where did that come from?
i would've tried the horoscope line .
no , too obvious .
hey !
wait up .
see what i mean?
here's my number .
in case you need us for ... ... questioning .
thank you , ladies .
bye .
bye .
he was always fascinated by all that macho mobster bullshit .
i hope this is okay .
i need to make this quick .
i gotta pick my kid up in 20 minutes .
oh , yeah , totally .
we were gonna move in together .
he promised he'd quit ... ... that stuff after he got out .
but then he goes and gets himself killed .
he's such an asshole .
i can only imagine what you must be going through .
i think that ...
honestly , you know , if i knew what he was up to , i'd be happy to tell you .
but we didn't talk much .
yeah .
so did you ...?
when did he ...?
did he ...?
what did ...?
so hutch , do you got any more questions?
yeah , well , sure .
we could ...
what's your sign?
gemini .
what ...
what do you weigh?
what does that have to do with anything?
it has everything to do with anything .
just answer the question , please , ma'am .
around 115 , i guess , give or take a pound or two .
i wish i could be more helpful .
stop .
don't do that .
you've been great .
i mean , it's terrific .
we got what we needed .
anything else?
i'm good .
yeah .
thank you .
thank you so much .
oh , wait .
i don't know if this will be of any help .
it's his .

i don't want it .
okay .
thank you .
again .
things getting any better at work , hutch?
actually , work was pretty good today .
how about you?
anything new?
nope .

yeah , that's what we do , isn't it , willis?
patrol !
whatever you say , hutch .
damn !
man , this thing is bad !
don't encourage him .
oh , shit .
starsky , this your ride?
damn .
you just moved up a notch in my book .
that puts you at notch one .
i like your lincoln .
it's a '76 .
it won't be out till next year .
i know people that know people that robbed some people .
so , what do you hear on the street these days?
dig this .
a little bird tells me there's gonna be a big coke deal in bay city .
one for the " guinness books " , so they say .
interesting .
who would this little bird be?
look , i lay it out for y'all to play it out .
all right .
what does that mean?
don't worry about it .
huggy , what can you tell us about this?
this looks like the work of big earl .
this boy loves dragons .
he makes these with his hands , you know?
there's his name stitched right up under the dragon's belly .
big earl?
yeah , he sews , but he's one tough mother .
he owns a biker bar about 80 miles east of route 4 .
biker bar?
what goes on down there?
i don't know .
listen to jim croce ... ... play darts , whatever the hell else you white people do .
look , fuzz , i gots to buzz .
this meeting is adjourned .
that's it?
that's it .
he lays it out for us to play it out .
oh , and by the way , this little meeting?
it never happened .
what meeting?
c'est la vie " , gentlemen .
great new technique where you press hard .
hands .
what , it's a verbal technique?
no .
keep your hands on me , i'm teasing .
what do you got on those cops?
everything .
records , home addresses , credit history .
nice .
starsky and hutchinson?
they call him hutch , actually .
i don't have enough on my plate already?
i got a major coke deal , my daughter's bat mitzvah , which is a total nightmare .
and now these two guys .
you think they're on to us?
they are investigating a murder .
that's what cops do .
it's why we pay taxes .
you're the worst .
you kidding?
will you look at these two guys?
he's cute , the blond .
but i like dark hair .
maybe we ought to push this whole thing .
till things cool off?
kevin , please , with the worry .
we're moving ahead as scheduled .
i'll handle those two clowns .
so tomorrow , i say we check out this biker bar , do a little deep cover .
sounds good .
who does your wig work?
i'm sorry , my what?
your wig work .
your undercover work , your disguises .
you have a wig guy?
oh , yeah , he's incredible .
well , if it isn't sonny and cher .
sonny and cher .
sit on it , manetti .
me sit on it?
yeah , you , sit on it .
why don't you sit on it , starsky , how's that sound?
you wish .
because i'm never sitting on it , ever .
that's not what i heard .
starsky !
come on .
come on !
jesus !
stop it !
what the hell is going on?
cool your jets , starsky !
everybody , back off !
including you , manetti .
i apologize , captain .
you're absolutely right .
you know , you're not even worth it , starsky .
and for the record ... ... those are hand towels .
the big towels are on the top shelf .
hand towels .
what a rod .
jesus christ .
he's right .
go cover up .
who are you guys?
my name's kansas .
and this is my little man toto .
we're jesters from up in big cliff , coming down and check out your place .
this it?
is this your place?
yeah .
nice .
tell me , if you two are jesters , what's our credo?
credo .
well ...
you almost got me there .
there's no credo .
other than the secret credo .
it ain't no secret .
it's written right on our damn crest .
a trick question?
if it's printed on the crest , you don't give it as a test .
anybody can read the crest .
that wouldn't prove we're jesters .
not cool .
that's a fake mustache .
oh , really?
well , i wonder if you think this is fake .
now , we got some questions !
i don't gotta give you nothing , cop !
wrong !
first , you've gotta give me a little respect .
second , you're gonna give me some answers , " comprende , muchacho "?
i like your style .
i like your moves .
now , where were we?
you were gonna tell us about terrence meyers .
who's terrence meyers?
wrong answer , big earl .
big earl?
i'm not big earl .
i'm jeff .
oh , yeah .
yeah .
jeff?
no one's who they say they are .
look .
honest , think about it .
i'm not even big .
yeah .
no , that's a good point .
maybe it's an ironic name , like tiny over in vice .
he's , like , 8 feet tall .
everybody says he's tiny ...
i know , except this guy's normal size .
he'd have to be a lot smaller for a name like big earl to be ironic .
you don't have to be a midget .
you're not exactly ...
how tall are you?
i don't know , 5'9 "?
well , that is kind of ...
basically ...
borderline .
it's average .
look .
big earl got pinched two weeks ago .
he's in bay city correctional .
i took over the bar till he gets out .
jeff , i'm sorry .
we apologize .
we're gonna pay big earl a visit .
let me get this for you .
there you go .
good as new .
next time you watch a place ... ... don't claim you own it because you watch it .
i housesit for my sister all the time , it's not like i claim that i own her house .
that goes for all y'all .
don't pretend to be something you're not .
just be who you are .
that's what's really cool .
how did you get in?
visiting hours are over .
special treatment .
we got some questions about terrence meyers .
terrence meyers?
yeah .
you made this jacket for him?
gee whiz , i don't seem to know anyone by that name at all .
hard customer .
offer him a radio or some bullshit .
maybe we can make your stay a little more comfortable .
nice transistor radio for your cell?
no .
how about a tv?
i tell you what .
i do like your blonde friend , here .
let me see your bellybutton .
no .
what ...
let's go .
come on .
no , listen .
no , no !
i'm not ...
hold on .
he's obviously a freak .
just show him a little skin .
show him your stomach .
nobody's here .
come on .
are we cool?
yes , we're cool .
oh , eureka .
god , that's nice .
it's like a little bowl of oatmeal with a hole in it .
i got one too .
oh , come on .
i just got a little more brown sugar on mine .
did you say " terrence meyers "?
yeah , i think i did make that jacket .
we might have pulled a job together .
what job?
who were you working for?
stand up .
walk to the back and do a spin for me .
wait a second .
i just showed you my stomach ...
come on , a deal's a deal , earl .
fine , then this conversation is over .
wait .
wait .
hold it .
come on .
wait .
" i can't hear you .
get up .
tell him to take his jacket off .
take your jacket off .
slow spin .
he says to do a slow spin .
tell him to arch his back and then look back at me , mean .
like a dragon .
he says to arch your back and look back at him , mean , like a dragon .
but keep it mean .
tell him great job .
he can sit down .
you're a very convincing dragon .
you should feel good about that .
just get this over with .
okay , here's the deal .
terrence and i worked as extra muscle for a couple of dealers .
i'd like to tell you who , but i don't know .
i never got a name , i never got a face .
they paid us in coke .
i was pretty pissed at the time .
i was hoping to get cash .
i'm no coke dealer .
right , so where's the coke?
if we find that coke , we can probably trace it .
fine .
fine .
look , i like you guys , okay?
especially you .
okay?
don't feel bad about that .
but i like you guys , so i'll tell you .
but ...
but first i need to see something , okay?
and it's gonna involve both of you .
i'm not gonna lie to you .
it's gonna get weird .
two dragons .
ready?
both of you , take your shirts off .
but do it slow .
i guess it's supposed to rain later tonight .
yeah , that's what i heard .
look , you know , what happened ...
can we please not talk about this , hutch?
we got the coke .
let's not ever talk about it .
you're right .
that's a good policy .
we got what we came for .
you think dragons ever ...
stop , i don't want to talk about it !
what the hell is wrong with you two?
come on , what are you ...?
you have brought disgrace ... ... on everyone who's ever worn a uniform .
my god .
we didn't know there was a camera .
cap , we're sorry .
at least we got the stash .
there's gotta be 30 grams of coke here , minimum .
this could lead us to the dealers that iced terrence meyers .
it's evidence .
we can print the bag , run forensics .
we did .
we got nothing .
what we got is a bag of artificial sweetener .
what are you talking about?
my granny wouldn't think this was coke .
come on , that's impossible .
we got the stuff from big earl .
i'm taking you two off this floater .
what?
i'm giving it to manetti .
manetti?
oh , come on , cap !
manetti's the worst cop on the force !
starsky .
stop .
go on , sit down .
come on .
look , captain , we're sorry , but come on .
you can't take us off this .
i just did .
now , leave .
and take your bag of artificial sweetener with you .
kicking the chair was a nice touch .
yeah , too bad it didn't work .
he'll get over it .
what i can't figure out is why earl got paid with bunk cocaine .
now we've got two leads .
we do?
stacey and holly .
those two cheerleaders?
no , no , those two witnesses .
they met terrence .
let's take them out , see what we can learn .
i mean , is it our fault that they also happen to be a couple of hot foxes?
reese , i couldn't help myself .
they were cops .
they were just too macho .
" macho?
" it's simple .
you should have lied .
i did .
i lied about you .
i didn't tell them anything .
but i had to give them something .
they were so pure .
you're lucky you're in the joint .
do you understand me?
look at the bright side .
" bright side?
it's the ultimate test .
the coke was in the police station .
they cleared it .
you should be happy .
well , guess what?
i'm not happy .
i'm not happy at all about it , earl !
don't shush me !
don't tell me to calm down !
understand?
what are you wearing?
quick .
what am i wearing?
silk flowered shirt and a vest .
why?
that's gorgeous .
you sick son of a bitch .
don't hang up .
don't hang up !
god .
some people .
i'm not gonna be able to fit in my uniform tomorrow .
is that a good or bad thing?
is this the way you two always treat witnesses?
well , that depends .
if it's a misdemeanor , we've been known to skip the fondue ... ... and move right to foot massages .
let me see .
watch out !
wait a minute , i think that's police brutality .
anybody for some coffee?
no , thanks .
okay , one for " le chef .
wow .
this place is great .
it serves my needs .
it's cozy .
homey .
can you help me find the sugar?
it's there .
hutch , help me find the sugar .
okay .
pardon me .
okay .
how we doing?
great .
your fondue put us over the top .

which one do you like?
we're gonna stick to this .
i have a thing for blondes .
good .
i'll take anything .
they're sweet little angels .
in two minutes , i want you to grab my guitar ... ... bring it to me , put it in my hands and step back .
you play?
just bring me the guitar .
wait .
hey , hey , where's the sugar?
i don't think i have any .
that's great .
he's a cop .
come here .
both of you .
you're so funny .
it's like a magpie convention in here .
let's get the cup out .
thank you , big earl .
do you ever get scared out there , on the streets?
yeah .
i'd like to say no , but the truth is , i do sometimes .
i'm one of those guys that's more about helping others than helping myself .
there we go .
it's all i knew .
it's more that there's someone i might not be able to help .
a citizen that needs aid , or even an animal .
look what i found .
put that away .
put it away !
hutch , you gotta play .
come on .
play , play .
please .
don't you wanna play?

what have you gotten me into , starsky?
thought we were partners .
come on , hutch !

starsky's bored .
anybody else bored?

a club could be fun .
club .
yeah .
okay , i'll get some more coffee and then we'll go .
is he okay?
isn't this place great?
do you like places like this?
you're a cheerleader , so you're dancing in formation .
this place can't be fun , because it's like you're at work .
are you okay?
you seem kind of wound up .
wound up?
no , i'm just pumped .
i'm excited .
rock solid , ready to go .
a little bit paranoid , but feeling really good .

everybody settle .
you know the rules .
keep it safe , keep it sexy ... ... and above all , turn up the night !
dancing rick getting warmed up here .
what's he gonna bring out for the appetizer course?
oh , it's a little hand over hand tuggle , man , right into the center of the floor .
that's all he's giving him .
that's a bucketful of confidence .
over to new guy david starsky .
this guy could be trouble .
it's the wild west .
those are six guns full of sexy .
the good , the bad and the groovy .
one , two , three , four , we've got disco war , folks .
dancing rick's going , " i don't like you , but i respect your moves .

driving that disco big rig .
shift gears , blow your funky horn .
pull into the truck stop and get yourself some scrapple made out of sexy .
disco rick brings it right back and he's not wasting any time , folks .

they're both on the floor , folks , eye to eye .
it's disco vietnam .
neither one's blinking or backing down .
let's see what happens .
angry cat .

i don't know .
these pantomimes aren't very good .
this must be reese's big surprise .

embarrassing .
reese just left .
i know .

i'll follow him .

how do i know?
what am i , your counselor?
yeah , i'd like to get to the information that i need , okay?

we take him down now .
let's go .

i think i speak for everyone when i say we're a little mimed out .
don't worry .
show's over .
you're under arrest for possession with intent to sell .
this man's a drug dealer .
okay , i think what we have ...
maybe you didn't hear us .
take it easy , everybody .
you're making the biggest mistake of your life , hear me?
you're the one making the mistake , pusher .
kevin , call my attorney , please .
ridiculous .
open it .
my hands are tied .
fine .
allow me .
let this be a lesson to everyone , especially you kids .
don't be fooled by the first class suit and the big house .
reese feldman's nothing more than a two bit drug dealer .
you want some proof?
here's some proof .
this is a bad man .
and this is what bad men do .
a pony !
happy bat mitzvah , baby .
i love you .
take the kids in , come on .
let's go , kids .
it's all right , baby , it's okay .
come here .
come here .
we'll get you a new pony .
hey there , little fella .
you okay?
mr. feldman , on behalf of the entire bay city police department ... ... i sincerely apologize .
that's okay , captain .
my attorney here would love to take them down , but i know ... ... that in the bottom of their hearts ... ... these two detectives were just trying to protect me and my family .
i gotcha .
thank you .
i respect your attitude , but you can be sure ... ... it will never happen again , because as of now ... ... both of you are suspended indefinitely .
look , cap , this was my fault .
don't drag hutch into this .
i shot the pony .
you care what happens to hutch?
you filed for transfer two weeks ago , citing his behavior as a reason .
captain ...
oh yeah , yeah .
check this out .
sounds like you're quite the crime fighter , hutch .
you filed for a transfer?
guns and badges , right here , on my desk .
your mother would be very disappointed in you .
man , i've really had it with that doby .
i mean , it's enough already .
cavorting with nefarious characters .
conduct unbecoming of an officer .
i wrote that two weeks ago .
things are really cool with us now .
hey , did you go through my locker?
no .
you went through my locker .
i might have looked inside ...
if you got a problem with someone , tell it to their face .
you come to them as a man .
you don't go behind their back and write a thesis and try to get transferred .
backstabber !
yeah , don't anybody work with david starsky .
he'll stab you in the back .
you've got to let this go .
we got lucky .
these guys screwed up .
they can't even touch us now .
it is over .
i don't care .
no one dresses as a mime and embarrasses me at my daughter's bat mitzvah .
in my own house , no less .
have some perspective .
we're almost finished .
we're a few days from closing a $35 million deal .
let it slide .
yeah , i'll let it slide .
when they're dead .
why did i get so lucky?
i don't know , i just love when you talk so tough .
of course you do .
that's why you're my girlfriend on the side .
hey , hutch .
ruin me !
excuse me , let me have a minute with my friend .
he didn't care if he got ruined .
that was the whole point of the episode .
did you ...?
hutch , you gonna have to lay up off of this juice .
you had too much to drink .
come on .
i feel like a million bucks .
just laughing , having a good time .
it ain't even funny no more .
there used to be a time here when you peed against the wall , you did it outside .
lighten up , it's friday night .
okay?
it's a bar .
hutch , it's wednesday afternoon , man .
snap out of it .
what time is it?
it's 5 : 00 , man .

i'm supposed to pick up willis at 3 .
huggy , i'm sorry , we ...
hutch !
hey , hutch !
you home?
you were supposed to pick me up at 3 : 00 today .
what happened?
deadbeat .
if you could have yourself one wish , what would it be for?
mama put the salt back on a straight line with the pepper ... ... and got that look like when she be telling me that old wise stuff .
she told nobie he should wish for ...
good friends .
free to be you and me " .
that's what mama tells nobie to wish for .
well , well , well .

i'm pretty good .
yeah?

damn .
a wrist rocket .
watch out with that thing .
very powerful .

even though you're my friend ... ... might have to report you to doby .
all right .
okay , look , hutch , can we ...?
is it all right if i talk to you outside?
no , i better stay here with the kid .
all right .
hey , feel better , all right?
you got it .
can you believe that guy?
what a ...
hutch , the man was trying to apologize .
dig this , man .
someone once said ... ... " to err is human , to forgive , divine .
what idiot said that?
i believe that was god , the greatest mack of all .
david .
david .
yeah .
okay , so , what did you wanna say?
nothing .
apparently you're too busy and i'm not worth it .
it's fine .
really , it's good .
come on , let's hear it .
there's nothing that ...
i just was gonna say that i think you're a good cop .
okay , well , thank you .
and i am ... ... sorry about what i wrote in the report .
yeah , because i'm telling you , i felt like i'd just gotten my world rocked ...
are you crying?
what's that?
are you crying?
no , i'm not crying .
you're crying .
it's okay to cry .
people cry .
that's great , but i'm not crying .

i don't cry .
i work out .
i have hobbies .
come here .

look , i'm telling you , it's right here .
reese is meeting with the biggest drug dealers in back alleys all over the place .
but talking isn't illegal .
yeah , the guy's not stupid .
he knows how to stay clean .
dirty ones always do .
we gotta find a way to get close to him , get inside and hear what's going on .
it's gonna be tough .
the guy knows what we look like .
he doesn't know what huggy bear looks like .
man , this is a bunch of crap .
i am an urban informant .
i am not a snitch .
come on , huggy , what's the difference?
a snitch wears a wire .
a snitch is the scum of the information industry .
a snitch has no soul .
damn , man , that shit hurt .
i'm sorry .
you got to be more careful .
we wouldn't ask you to do this unless it was really important .
i'm gonna owe you one .
more than one , man .
let's slow down with the scorekeeping .
i might remember ... ... stuff i've overlooked over the years , then mention it to my partner here .

i'm a quitter , but ...
you're crying again .
i'm not crying .
this is different .
it's my mother .
she always used to say that this was too much car for me to handle .
she said that?
couldn't handle the v8 .
i don't know , maybe she was right .
hey , look at me .
look at me .
i am not your mother .
i'm your partner .

things could go pretty wrong , so i ...
keep your eyes on the road .
listen to me , ken .
if we don't make it , this ...
you know , us ...
it's been good .
it's been great .
now , will you stop talking and hit that boat .
it's not a boat , it's a yacht .
son of a bitch !
come on , are you kidding me?
oh , my god .
we almost just got killed .
thanks for pointing out something i couldn't notice .
you're a benefit to have .
we should save them .
son of a bitch !
nice plan !
you gave it too much gas and you overshot it .
car has a lot of horsepower .
i'll go get it .
what are you doing?
stop it .
starsky !
it hasn't hit the bottom yet .
stop , stop , damn it !
listen to me .
it's gone , okay?
it's over .
but it's my car .
i know it is , partner .
i know it is .
oh , my god , honey .
that was so incredible .
i feel like my adrenaline is just ...
you and me , babe .
we are such a good team , don't you think?
i mean , this is just the beginning .
we could go so far , honey .
i feel so exhilarated .
come on !
what was that?
son of a bitch .
what is it , reese?
who are you?
i found your 9 iron , bitch .
that's for putting hands on huggy bear .
nobody touches the bear , you dig?
yeah .
now , these will work .
what have we here?
now , that's what i'm talking about .
we don't really do private shows .
but i'm a good friend of huggy bear .
it's kind of against cheerleading policy .
you need to change that policy .
you know what i can't figure out?
how the hell did you know to get on that boat?
when your two boys put me on that undercover golf course mission ... ... that cat , reese?
all he did was talk about that damn yacht .
and like i say , why go to the starting line when you can go straight to the finish?
straight to the finish .
i like that , man .
i like that .
are you interested in doing any undercover work?
not the least .
captain , let me borrow him for a second .
the weird thing is , one of those briefcases with $5 million just up and vanished .
oh , what is this , a brand new fur coat?
look at this thing .
yeah , i inherited some money from a dead uncle of mine .
is that right?
i didn't even know you had an uncle .
well , i did .
and he was rich as hell too , baby .
chin up , little man .
i think he's still upset about the car .
come on , let's get up .
you're going outside .
no , thanks .
we're taking you out .
we're gonna get you cleaned up .
i don't feel like it .
i know these two white dudes that got a car that you might be interested in .
i don't want another car , hug .
come on , at least take a look .
my car .
where did you ...?
hey , hutch , who the hell are these guys?
i don't know , but i get a good vibe from them .

well , actually , your friend here has already paid for it .
i owe you one , huggy .
all right .
