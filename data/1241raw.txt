and now for all you romantics out there , this one is for you .
hello , betty .
shouldn't you be at the hospital , looking after a certain other soldier?
is there any way you can find it in your heart to forgive me?
i wonder if these two get together .
i'll forgive you on one condition .
what's that?
dance with me .
explain one thing to me .
what kind of desperate and pathetic emotional cripple would actually buy that as an ending?
rosie , do you think that in real life
tad hamilton is the man he seems to be on the screen?
absolutely .
i mean , you just can't fake that kind of thing .
what do you think tad hamilton is doing right now?
i'll bet he's in church .
watch this .
yeah !
whoo !
told you that was him , right?
yeah .
tad hamilton .
you don't make it easy on us , tad .
what do you mean?
this is the shot the paparazzi got .
congratulations .
you're actually drinking , driving , smoking ,
leering and groping at the same time .
which , on the one hand , is just about the coolest thing " ve ever seen .
richard .
but , on the other hand , it can be argued this might be bad for the image .
you play characters who have heart .
this is a person who will have a heart attack .
i can't believe you guys are blaming my unemployment on this photograph .
you are not unemployed .
dockworkers are unemployed .
you are simply between million dollar paydays .
as are we , since we both get a percentage of your payday .
but this isn't about us .
whatever happened to that part in the jimmy lng movie?
im perfect for that .
well , he's taking a breath .
he's what?
he's taking a breath .
he's pausing before deciding .
he's hemming and hawing and taking a breath .
and this is only going to make him breathe more .
what do we do?
asphyxiate the son of a bitch .
we generate a little positive pr .
what are you , an interpreter?
i'm saying we just need to do something , tad , to remind jimmy lng and america that you are the boy next door .
i am the boy next door , if you happen to live in a very dysfunctional neighborhood .
congratulations .
you've eaten your body weight in pringles .
what's your favorite pringle?
sour cream and onion or original?
well , the sour cream and onion has a very strong taste .
so if you're eating a small amount , half a can , you want that strength .
but if you're eating more , you want the original .
it's a cleaner flavor .
wait until you discover barbecue flavor .
you'll finally become a woman .
how's modern grocer treating you over there , pete?
this is the swimsuit issue .
oh , my god .
what is it?
win a date with tad hamilton .
what?
it's to benefit save the children .
that is so like him .
saving children .
i know .
ohhh !
should i enter?
why not?
sure .
heaven is just a mouse click away .
a mouse click and 100 buck donation .
we can raise 100 bucks .
with your permission , petey .
im sorry?
paper or plastic?
paper , please .
would you help rosalee win a date with tad hamilton and help save the children?
i certainly would .
aren't these great?
the best .
along with a $125 check in recognition of yet another piggly wiggly store manager of the month award .
congratulations .
thank you , mr. ruddy .
so , pete , when do we lose you to richmond?
because you're running out of wall space here .
well , i got my acceptance letter to virginia state .
that's good .
and i got my student loan .
so , there's just one more thing .
what?
there's someone here that i ...
i need to have a discussion with about the going to richmond with me issue .
jars are full .
i love everybody in this store so much .
sorry for interrupting .
sorry .
it was nice to meet you .
it was nice to meet you , too .
good night .
good night .
are you taking off?
yes , sir .
muchas gracias .
hasta el proximo miercoles .
i am the albanian one , mr. hamilton .
i'm sorry .
could you tell the other one ...
muchas gracias " and " hasta el proximo miercoles .
will do .
thank you .
ok , what do i need to beat you?
double 14 , or it's all over .
that's not going to be a problem .
don't miss .
don't miss , don't miss , don't miss , don't miss , don't miss .
um , are you actually doing that?
yeah .
and now pete will get the bartendress's attention .
she's waiting for you .
and we're waiting for our round , pete .
fine .
angelica .
yes , pete?
what is the object of your desire?
we need another round .
one day , pete , one day ,
i know that the answer to that question will be " you , angelica .
you are the object of my desire .
ok .
but for now we'll just go with the beers .
oh , pete .
enough .
thank you , ladies .
you don't like her the teeniest , tiniest bit?
what?
rosie ...
no , she's not my type , ok?
you are so particular .
who the heck are they?
if that fire alarm went off again ...
why would they send a news crew for that?
wait a second .
right here , please .
in first class you get a dvd player and may view the film of your choice .
i'd like to touch intimately whoever thought of that .
we would like to begin boarding our first class passengers .
that's you .
i know .
guys .
just take it easy , ok?
just give me a hug and tell me to have a good time , please?
ok .
just be careful , ok?
what do you mean?
i mean that this guy is tad hamilton .
in his life , he's probably slept with like 15 , 20 women .
no way .
that's not even physically possible .
besides , like he's going to be interested in me .
if he claims he doesn't like watching sports , he's trying to sleep with you .
got it .
if he claims to love animals , he's trying to sleep with you .
ok .
guys are guys .
rich or poor .
famous or grocers .
right .
just do me one favor , ok?
guard your carnal treasure .
ok .
just guard your carnal treasure .
thanks , pete .
remember everything .
i will .
remember how he smells .
i will .
but not just vaguely .
i want good , solid similes . he smells like a forest on the first day of spring .
ok , cathy .
you're going to miss your flight .
i will bring you similes .
thank you .
i almost forgot .
i got you something .
it's regular flavor .
in case you don't like the prime rib in first class .
thank you , pete .
right this way .
just guard your carnal treasure .
i heard you .
that's me .
welcome to los angeles .
e
oh !
can i have these?
no .
do you want to think about it?
gee , what ...
tell me why you're making me have dinner with an okie .
because she's wholesome as the amber waves of grain .
and she's not an okie .
she's from west virginia .
so sorry .
you never wear them .
can i just have them?
so what's her name anyway?
rosalee futch .
sounds insanely hot .
it's very nice to meet you , tad .
it's so nice to meet you , tad .
it's great to meet you .
please , just follow the rules .
smile for the cameras .
no brown liquor or cigarettes .
fine .
very good .
what about jimmy lng?
have we heard anything?
no .
still breathing .
i passed ashton kutcher in my car and he seemed happy .
he's happy for other reasons .
im sorry .
we have not heard from jimmy lng .
hey , guys , how's this in the shoulders?
seriously .
because i got some yoga stuff .
your films will stand the test of time .
your films will stand the test of time .
hi .
im tad .
your standing films will time and test themselves .
thank you .
you're pretty .
it's roseanne , right?
im sorry , what is it?
ricky?
it's rosalee .
rosalee .
rosalee .
nice to meet you .
so , you ready?
ok , let's ...
yikes a bee .
so , how was your flight?
your films will stand the test of time .
thank you .
so , you ready?
for what?
right this way .
rosalee futch .
it'll take a few minutes for the spots in your eyes to go away , but they will .
ok .
we're right here .
is it always like that?
well , pretty much .
shake a doo .
shake a what?
it just means " wow .
shake a doo .
shake a doo , i like that .
so ...
you excited?
are you kidding?
this is like a fairy tale .
yeah , i figured .
you ok?
yeah .
i'm just not used to sitting sideways like this .
we don't have sideways seating in west virginia .
and i think the cigarette smoke is kind of ...
you can come sit back here if you like .
i can't really move right now .
boy , i don't feel well . " ve always been kind of motion sickness y .
once , this carnival came to fraziers bottom , and they had that ride where it spins around and you have to stand against the side and the center falls out .
and i ...
damn it .
pardon me .
ahh !
this is just so far from the way i imagined the evening going .
it's perfectly all right .
right , mickey?
perfectly all right .
shall we?
have a nice dinner .
i'll just be out here scrubbing .
hey , steve .
good to see you , mr. hamilton .
good to see you , larry .
hey , man , how are you?
what's up?
hey .
this way .
doesn't it hurt , smiling like that all the time?
you get used to it .
should i do it?
yeah .
you might not be able to hold it long , but go for it .
sure i will .
see that?
it sort of gets you right there .
that's horrible .
i told you .
you sure do have a lot of stuff .
yeah , sorry .
i'm never out of touch with the people who torment me .
who are they?
agents , managers , people like that .
this man , jimmy lng , who's making this movie im exactly right for but , for whatever reason , he's taking a breath .
a what?
he's thinking it over .
it's just all very competitive , this business , that's all .
everybody seems to be chasing the same thing .
the same parts in the same movies , the same awards , the same big money .
well , im sure you have too much common sense to get caught up in all that .
i mean , it's just a recipe for an unsatisfying life .
obviously you have your priorities straight , so ...
so , rosalee , what do you do?
i work in a piggly wiggly .
im sorry?
a supermarket .
i bag and check .
cool .
yeah .
it's a real dream come true .
but it's fun .
my two best friends work there .
so , what do you do , tad?
oops .
what i mean is , what do you do when you're not doing what you do?
not a lot , you know .
there's not a lot of time left for hobbies , really .
and i don't really like watching sports , so i read .
play with my dog , my cat , my bird , you know .
i ...
i love animals , you know?
what do you think they're doing right now?
i bet they're in her hotel room , straining for breath .
his manhood yearning to be free .
her hands running over the ripples in his abdomen .
her perfect bosom crying out in ecstasy .
great .
all righty .
i had one of those .
a retainer?
yeah , on the lowers and a night brace for the uppers .
i had really bad teeth as a kid .
yeah , im sure you were a real ugly duckling .
i was like anybody else .
a little gawky , unsure who i was .
combination skin .
well , you came together nicely .
thank you .
so did you .
bon appetit !
umm hmm !
thanks , mickey .
oh , wow .
this is beautiful .
these people sure leave a lot of lights on .
it's beautiful .
it is .
and you , if i may say so , are also very beautiful .
how would you like to come back to my house for a little bit?
sure .
for a little bit .
shake a doo?
no , shake a doo .
good .
miss ramirez .
sonja .
anybody in the casa?
i think we're all alone .
oh !
do you want to come in a little further?
um , you know what , tad , thank you , but i think i should get back to the hotel .
wow .
ok .
i don't want the concierge to worry , you know .
good for you .
good for you .
i'll take you home .
you don't have to do that .
you're already here .
no , it would be my pleasure .
ok , thanks .
that's really nice .
rosalee , it's been wonderful to meet you .
i wish you only good things in life .
and to me , wonderfulness , too .
and to you , only the self same good wishes .
you know what im saying?
yeah , of course .
thanks for the best night of my life .
no , thank you .
may i give you a kiss goodbye?
i think you might maybe may .
good evening .
thank you .
good night , rosalee .
sweet dreams .
god !
the limo door swung open .
my foot hit the ground and i turned to take one last look at tad .
at those eyes , at that smile .
and then , regretfully , i headed back for the hotel .
please tell me we're done now .
we're done .
wow .
i cannot remember a time before you started telling that story .
peter , i was asked to provide a detailed description of the evening .
and you did .
actually , rosie , you did a great job .
i felt like i was there .
sort of against my will , but i did .
ok , guys , with your permission ,
i think we should all now return to our normal lives .
ok .
actually ...
rosie , i kind of had something that i wanted to ask you .
rosie .
whatever .
it's something that i think you're going to like .
i hope you're going to like .
something i really hope you're going to like .
it's been a long time coming , so it might be kind of a surprise .
or not , or maybe not .
i don't know .
i'm like ...
look , ok , what im trying to say is that
i ...
hey .
let me ask you , what would be the absolute worst thing that could happen to me right now?
hi .
hi .
i'm tad .
this is my cathy friend .
and my pete friend .
im tad .
it's quite pleased and pleasant to ...
i've heard a lot about you both .
have you?
yeah .
so what are you doing here?
i came to see you .
no way .
you're just ...
that's just ...
yeah .
no .
yeah .
you can't ...
here?
it's true .
you mean your normal business itinerary does not include fraziers bottom?
no .
ok , cathy .
am i too late to take you to lunch?
no .
great .
shall we?
yeah .
if that's ok , pete .
well , actually ...
if that's ok .
it's ok .
if you're going back to the airport i'll ride with you .
by the route 73 cloverleaf , i'll have given myself to you in ways you have only read about in the drugstore .
it was great to meet you .
you , too .
was there something that you wanted to tell me?
it was nothing .
ok .
wow .
nice car .
thanks .
i asked the manager for a rental convertible and he gave me his wife's car .
really?
and that was the last time we ever saw her .
cathy , he's not her type .
no .
rich , famous , handsome , ass like cement .
you are absolutely right .
move these cheeseburgers .
here you go , sweetpea .
oh , my gosh .
here you go , rosie .
thanks .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
i still can't believe you're here .
it was something i had to do .
sure .
fly clear across the country to have lunch at the fraziers bottom diner .
i couldn't let that night be the last time i saw you .
can i just stop you and remind you of one thing?
what's that?
im nobody .
rosalee , nobody is nobody .
fine .
im following my gut .
sometimes you have to do that , even if what you're doing seems crazy .
because in the gap between what prudence says we should do and what our heart tells us we must do , well , rosie , therein lies our humanity .
that's from the road to el dorado .
you really are a big fan , aren't you?
is that how you get women?
you steal lines from your own movies?
not anymore .
wow .
i hope not .
that would shoot a hole in your credibility .
rosie , the truth is that when we went on our date you said something that resonated with me .
you said you were sure i had my priorities straight .
but here's the thing .
i don't .
i really don't .
my entire life has been about becoming successful , famous , becoming this thing that i am .
and you were right , it really is unsatisfying .
i need a positive influence , somebody with solid and substantial qualities , somebody who seems to understand life and how to live it in a good and happy way , like you .
i just want to be around you .
i want some of that goodness to rub off on me .
do you mean goodness in a romantic way?
no , a platonic goodness .
and i mean that very seriously .
no funny business here .
did i say something wrong?
no .
no , no , no .
no .
so , are you going to be in fraziers bottom for a while , then?
i think i have to .
if im going to reset my priorities , i got to get out of la .
i got to get out of that fishbowl .
so , what do you say?
i say , yikes a bee .
what does that mean?
it's just something my dad and i say when life surprises you and there's nowhere to go but forward .
is that like " yes "?
yes .
yes .
thanks for lunch .
i'll see you at seven , then .
see you at seven .
ok .
ok .
stop .
seriously .
you go , girl .
you get your man .
it's room eight .
just go down to the door marked eight .
all right .
it's just past seven .
if you hit nine , you've gone too far .
got you .
no phone calls , please .
all right .
thank you .
have a great night .
you , too .
i'll see you tomorrow .
very good .
00 .
ok .
he wants your goodness to rub off on him .
i know , right?
i see .
and you actually believe this?
why wouldn't l?
wow , rosie .
there's innocent , there's childlike , and then there's just asking for it .
he wants your goodness to rub off on him?
he wants your ass to rub off on him is more like it .
oh , my god .
yeah .
whatever .
you can't go out with him tonight .
what do you mean i can't?
i mean that i need you to stay for the late shift .
janine's sick .
yeah , she's got a cough .
she does not .
no , not yet , but she will .
she's definitely coming down with something .
no , she's not .
janine , cough for me .
cough for me .
see?
god , it's all in your lungs .
what is?
nothing .
you're fine .
no , you're not .
do not tell my employees when they are fine .
she's fine .
even if she weren't , you'd have to find somebody else because i am going out with tad hamilton .
stop that .
i did feel something in my lungs .
you're not getting off tonight , janine .
bob , not now .
everywhere inn .
yeah .
do you guys have any other rooms?
or how about suites?
well , yeah , we got sweets .
we got some lollies here by the register if you want to come on by and get yourself a lolly .
no , i mean maybe something a little bigger or newer?
bigger and newer?
yes , i understand what you mean .
and no , we don't have suites like that .
ok , i guess that's cool .
that's cool , i guess .
can you hold on a second?
yes , sir .
hello .
hi , big guy .
where are you?
i'm at a motel in fraziers bottom , west virginia .
ok .
words i never heard anyone utter .
she's special , richard .
who?
the girl from the charity thing .
the win a date girl?
you flew to a place actually called fraziers bottom , west virginia , and are staying in a motel in order to nail the win a date girl?
whoa , whoa , whoa .
i don't want to nail her .
please don't put it in those terms .
oh , forgive me , lord byron .
i want to be around her , you know?
she has a goodness .
there's a lot that i can learn from her .
i'm trying to feed my soul , ok?
im trying to find a way to be happy .
you want to be happy now?
this is big for me , richard .
oh , god .
this is a turning point for me .
you think that today .
but by the end of the week , when you've nailed her , you're going to feel differently .
and what do you suppose happens then?
i don't ...
i will tell you what happens then .
you pulverize her heart , and then the press finds out and all the good that was done by the promotion gets washed away .
and jimmy lng continues breathing .
people like you can't have relationships with girls from montana .
west virginia .
whatever .
why not?
you're too different .
your values are different .
for example , she has them .
no , this can work .
it can't and when it ends , it's very bad for business .
there are more important things than business .
i don't even know who im talking to now .
hello?
is this tad?
what have you done with tad?
i got to go , ok?
no , you do not got to go .
you're going through some kind of a phase .
an extreme version of your normal in between jobs insanity .
and it has a hold of you .
you need to come back to la , have a bushmills and a percocet , go out with an actress
looking to advance her career and end this self destructive behavior .
i'll talk to you soon .
no , tad .
bad tad .
bye , richard .
don't hang up on me .
owww !
hello?
yes , mr. hamilton .
i am here , sir .
you wouldn't happen to have a masseuse on staff?
no , but i am a very fast learner , and i could , you know ...
hello?
it always comes around
coming .
you must be tad .
must be .
you are tad .
i know what you look like .
nice to meet you , mr. futch .
henry , for god's sake .
please , come in .
thank you .
rosie'll be down in a minute .
ok , great .
may i offer you a chocolate martini?
wow , look at that .
i hear they're very big out your way .
yeah?
yeah , i guess they are .
i'm driving , so ...
attaboy .
have a seat .
so , it looks like emperor's new clothes will top $100 mill in domestic bo .
yeah .
and quantum studios , i think they're looking to vertically integrate , either by buying a web or a weblet .
could be .
yes .
yeah .
hey .
hi .
i see you've met dad .
yeah .
we've been talking shop .
so what do you want to do tonight?
do you guys have a movie theater?
the warner .
it's part of the loews family of theaters .
have you seen king arthur of britain? " ve been wanting to .
you two enjoy yourselves .
have her back by dawn .
and no cocaine .
no , sir .
how was l?
you were great , daddy .
good night .
bye bye .
im telling you , that's him .
oh , yeah .
mom , i swear it's him .
you think so?
yes , it's tad hamilton .
you look so sad there .
give me a break .
i'd just lost my wife and my goat .
next week , on a very special paramedic rescue ...
and what were your respective ages?
i was 12 and she was 30 .
did your mother know?
yeah .
hasta el proximo miercoles .
ahora disponsible en viernes in super mercado .
so , what do people do at this point in the evening in fraziers bottom?
well , they go to the diner .
we could do that .
we haven't eaten anything in almost , what , 15 minutes .
or they go home .
it is a school night .
of course , if it were a date , we might go to the watergap overlook .
and what do people do there?
they park .
and then?
and then they marvel at what a feat of engineering the gap is .
but this isn't a date .
we can't do that .
no .
no .
i don't want to do anything to harm the friendship .
me neither .
over two trillion tons of water pass through the gap every hour .
that's enough water to float a battleship .
or put out every fire in west virginia .
no kidding .
uh oh .
excuse me .
huh .
hello .
hi , mr. futch .
it's pete .
hiya , pete .
rosie's not here .
she's out with tad hamilton .
really?
i hadn't ...
ok , cool .
good for her , then .
he seems like a very nice guy .
he does .
a lovely , lovely guy .
so , like , where did they go?
the movies .
the movies .
ok .
it looks like the seven o'clock would get out at 8 . 45 , 8 . 50 ... or so someone happened to just mention to me in passing .
so i guess that would put them out and about and onto their next activity .
i guess it would , pete .
i'll leave rosie a note that you called .
yeah , i just had a little inventory question .
a little dairy case query .
but we can clear that up tomorrow .
ok , pete .
goodbye .
all right .
rosie ...
could i see your driver's license and regis ...
yikes a bee .
hello , officer .
rosalee?
hi , tom .
hi .
wow .
oh , boy .
ok , then .
we heard you were in town , mr. hamilton .
did you?
pretty fond of our rosalee there , huh?
yes .
yes , i am , officer .
tom?
right , right , listen .
we got a call saying that there was someone parked here and you know it's illegal after sunset , so ...
you got a call at this hour?
yeah .
from who , a raccoon?
never mind .
i am going to kill pete , bring him back to life and then kill him again .
calm down .
calm down .
why aren't you upset?
because it doesn't matter .
ok?
what happened here tonight was a force of nature .
two people set out to be friends , but nature would have none of it .
nature wanted them to be more .
and nature is going to want that tomorrow .
what did i tell you?
what did i tell you about your carnal treasure?
you said to guard it .
i said , guard it .
and what did you do?
you practically chucked it at him .
you're acting like it was a sleazy night .
it wasn't .
it was classy .
it's not like he took you to the movies and then felt you up in his car .
the evening evolved , pete .
my god , did he actually say that?
it started as two friends going to the movies ...
and it evolved into dry humping .
he fought it .
he didn't want to do anything that might wreck the friendship .
wow .
did he actually ...
i can't believe he used that line .
and i can't believe you bought it .
it's not a line .
ok , fellas , a show of hands .
who here has used some form of the " don't want to harm the friendship " line?
father newell?
well , prior to my enfrockment .
rosie , what are tad's pectorals like to the touch?
are they warm yet firm like ...
cath , that's really not helping now .
sorry , got caught up .
thanks .
listen , rosie , just ...
listen to me , bottom line .
tad hamilton is an actor , ok?
how do you know that he's not acting with you?
he's not acting .
no .
he is .
he's playing a role .
the role of hollywood bad boy trying to find virtue .
ok , after you guys have ...
after you guys have been together a couple of times he's out of here , ok?
you will never see him again .
hey , rosie , guess what?
i bought a house .
i bought a house .
can you believe it?
can you believe it?
it's actually a farm with a house and a silo for my wheat .
really?
you bought a house .
i bought a house .
we're putting down roots , baby .
what do you think of that?
it's good .
come see it .
maybe after work?
i'd love to .
yeah , i'd love to .
great .
he's going to stay in the motel while he fixes up the farm .
he's a farmer all of a sudden?
i think he'll be a good farmer .
he's from malibu , california .
the only thing they grow there are breasts .
could you smile a little bit?
this means nothing .
you are unbelievable .
what?
rosie , people like this buy houses all the time .
it's called a tax shelter .
peter .
i can guarantee you that by the end of today
tad's farm and his house and his fricking wheat will be right back on the market .
why?
what are you going to do?
nothing .
you know , just be a good neighbor .
howdy .
tad , this place is unbelievable .
thanks , little lady .
this barn sits on what they call " the south 40 .
yeah .
im not sure exactly how many acres that is , but
i'm going to guess that's a lot .
i'm going to guess 40 .
oh , yeah .
could be .
tad , being a new farm owner and all ,
i know you'll probably get some people to run this place for you , but ... hell , i'd be happy to show you a couple of everyday farm chores .
really?
pete , that would be great .
thank you .
tad , that's not a problem .
what you're going to do here is grab on to one of the ... essentially one of the nipples , and just pull it firmly but gently towards the pail .
you're going to freak out a ...
mmm , look at all that creamy milk .
that a girl , arleen .
that a girl .
you are making old tad thirsty .
where'd you learn to do that?
pete , you remember my remake of the grapes of wrath?
ok , so , the trick is to take a full swing so as to split the log in one swift ... stroke .
ok .
yeah .
let's do this .
so , you work out?
no .
yeah , me neither .
i know , it's like ...
me neither .
ok .
it's just basically one swift stroke .
ok .
and sometimes , basically , you get a bad piece of wood .
basically .
and sometimes you don't .
that's good .
beginner's luck .
first time's the charm .
and the luck continues .
that's great for you , man .
did you ever see a movie i did called a man named jackson?
if it came out , tad , then i saw it .
i think the ax is actually broken .
you got it .
good .
get someone else to cry , because i don't cry .
i don't do that .
which is why i try to stay away from melodramas .
oh , my god .
i finally did it .
people , are you watching this?
rosie .
pete .
hey , tad .
hey .
can i talk to you for a sec?
yeah , sure .
forgive the intrusion , but ...
no , no .
please , fire away .
ok .
here it is .
you win , ok?
fair and square .
you win .
thank you .
you did have an advantage or two going in , but ...
excuse me , we're in the middle of something here .
yeah , no problem .
i want rosie to be happy .
so , i got to ask you a couple of questions .
do you know how long she keeps her hair in straight or in curly mode?
what?
or why her favorite necklace has a starfish clasp?
no .
do you even know that she has six different smiles?
she has six smiles?
yeah .
one when something flat out makes her laugh .
one when she's laughing out of politeness .
but there's one when she makes plans .
one when she makes fun of herself .
one when she's uncomfortable .
and one when ...
one when she's talking about her friends .
i don't know those things yet , pete .
no , you don't , tad .
i'm telling you , she is more of ... a treasure than you can possibly know .
she's not just some wholesome small town girl , some good for you breath of fresh air .
tad , she is a wonderful person with a huge heart .
yeah .
and the kind of beauty that a guy only sees once , you know?
once .
listen , tad , if there is even a chance that you could break her heart , please , just , for her sake ... walk away , man .
i could never break rosalee's heart .
ok?
good .
because if you do , i swear to god ,
i will tear you to pieces with my bare hands .
or vicious rhetoric .
you're a good guy , pete .
but it's apparently not good enough .
do you mind if i ...
yeah , no .
my bad .
finish up in here .
im sorry .
you're a good kisser .
but i guess it doesn't come as a shock to you to hear that .
you're a really good kisser .
even compared to hollywood girls?
mm hmm .
that's just ridiculous .
oh , tad hamilton .
your favorite people are here .
you got to be kidding me .
who is it?
guess who?
it's my agent and my manager .
taddy?
tadala .
this is a nightmare .
housekeeping .
let us in .
hey , tad .
i'd like to apologize for ...
open zee zleibenshlocken .
come on .
you're not going to be punk'd .
fellas .
tad edward hamilton .
howdy , little lady .
hi .
my manager , richard levy and my agent , richard levy .
you're both named richard levy?
who isn't?
you .
you must be rosalee .
yes .
did we come at a bad time?
i hope so .
actually , yes .
well , tad .
jimmy lng stopped breathing .
what?
you got the part , pal .
seems he saw something that reminded him that he had to have you .
it was the body of your work .
i knew it .
your credits .
the reality of you and who you are .
he called me and said , " who am i kidding?
tad hamilton has to play this part .
there's nobody else .
fellas , i have never felt better than i do at this moment .
except for that weekend in cabo .
that is exactly what i am talking about .
easy , " ve got a bad back .
that's exactly what im talking about .
i told you a little good career news would put your head back on straight .
so then you're leaving?
yes .
fittings monday and rehearsals tuesday .
you're back on the beam , pally .
boy , things happen fast .
oh , my god .
you're right .
no , it's fine .
im going to turn it down .
what?
what?
you are?
i came here vowing to change my priorities and at the first opportunity im abandoning that .
you're not going to turn down the part .
we both know that .
give us a minute , will you , fellas?
we'll be in the lobby .
i wonder if they have a masseuse on staff .
i want you to go with me .
what?
what?
she absolutely cannot go with him .
i won't take the part unless you come me .
although we could work something out .
really?
yes , really .
rosie , have you been listening to anything " ve been telling you?
i love you .
how many times in your life have you said that?
not counting the movies?
not counting .
i've said it a few times .
but ...
but i never knew what it meant .
i can't go with you , tad .
because you don't love me .
you maybe want to love me , but i think what you love right now is the idea of me .
you can't love someone for what they stand for or seem to be .
you have to love them for their details , for the things that are true of them and only them .
i do love you for your details , rosie .
you don't .
you couldn't possibly .
you don't even know what they are .
you have six smiles .
what?
you have six smiles .
did you know that?
one when something really makes you laugh .
and one when you're just laughing out of politeness .
one when you're making plans and one when you're making fun of yourself .
one when you're uncomfortable and one when ...
one when you're talking about your friends .
how many is that?
like 50 .
i told you .
i told you .
that is so much better than any speech from any of your movies .
i had a better writer .
so ...
will you go?
yes .
he's going back to cali , to cali , to cali .
what are you thinking?
nothing .
im done thinking .
if im making a huge mistake , i don't want to know .
you're not making a mistake .
you know , as a bartender you do learn to kind of recognize those customers who need to talk .
angelica , im fine .
but could i have , like , six more of these?
no , pete .
you really need to talk .
ok .
i think that our friend rosie ... might be falling in love with tad hamilton .
yeah , didn't have to be a bartender to see that one coming .
right , but the problem with that is ... that im in love with rosie .
you know , i always thought that maybe you were .
so how much do you love her?
is it love , is it big love or is it great love?
what do you mean?
love you get over in two months .
big love , two years .
and great love ...
yeah?
great love changes your life .
oh , my god .
it's great love .
lsn't that great?
you got to win her back .
angelica , trust me , i have tried everything .
what did she say when you told her that you love her?
well , actually , maybe not everything , but ...
what did she say when you kissed her?
ok , maybe it's more like two things i haven't tried .
well , what have you tried?
i have very unsubtly implied how i feel about her .
ok , get up .
what?
get your ass off the barstool .
angelica .
hey , if you feel it and you don't do everything in your power to reach for it you are basically slapping life in the face .
i hate to break it to you , but i don't stand a chance here , ok?
honey , your odds go up when you file an application .
sure , but im up against ...
tad hamilton .
you are tad hamilton .
what?
don't you see?
everybody's tad hamilton to somebody , pete .
rosalee's tad hamilton to you .
and you're tad hamilton to me .
angelica , thank you .
so start acting like it .
ok .
yeah , ok .
you are a really good bartender .
hi .
hey .
come in , come in .
i have something to talk to you about .
me , too .
really?
you go first .
no , you go first .
no .
seriously , you go first .
ok .
tad got a part in this huge movie and he asked me to go with him to california for the shoot .
we leave tomorrow afternoon .
lsn't that great?
i probably should've gone first .
why?
what were you going to say?
it's nothing .
it was nothing .
just , you know , travel safely , ok?
and just really enjoy the shoot .
actually , no , i remember what i was going to say .
i love you , rosie .
i always have .
if " ve been a jerk this last week , it's because i have been fighting .
i have been fighting for you .
i don't want to lose you to tad hamilton or anyone else .
you're the one .
so , any reaction to any of this?
because now would be an excellent time .
now?
you kiss me now?
you say this to me now , after 22 years of being my friend?
yes , to all questions .
i'm ...
i have to pack .
you're telling me that you can't answer the most important question i'll ever ask in my entire life because you have to pack?
not only do i have to pack , but i have a load of whites in the dryer , and my dad called my relatives from san clemente and they're expecting me , so .. it's all in the works .
but this is ...
rosie , what's in your heart?
i'm sorry .
i'm sorry , too .
you ok , pete?
yes , sir .
listen , pete , obviously we've all been a little seduced by tad hamilton's presence .
no one more so than me .
but that doesn't mean i don't know who cares about my daughter the most and who she would be with if the world were fair .
well , it's not .
no .
no , it's not .
when i was your age i was completely in love with eleanor hershey .
of the chocolate hersheys?
the hershey chocolates?
she was a great girl , completely unpretentious .
i actually met her filling her cadillac up with gas .
anyway , there was this french guy .
he was really rich .
he owned , like , france .
i didn't stand a chance .
it happens that way sometimes .
it shouldn't , but it does .
sometimes goliath kicks the shit out of david .
it's just nobody bothers to tell that story .
well , thanks , mr. futch .
i feel much better now .
goodbye , mr. futch .
take it easy , pete .
are you sure you know what you're doing?
no .
ever feel more confused or alone?
no .
have a nice flight .
so , we'll see you after principal photography .
yes , daddy .
you guys don't mind not flying with us?
we need our privacy .
that's fine .
yeah .
we look forward to our shit ass commercial flight .
i always wanted a layover in cincinnati .
we will be absolutely fine .
another one in chicago .
so we'll be in la by april?
we'll be fine .
it's time .
ok .
safe trip , tad .
bye , honey .
welcome aboard , mr. hamilton .
bye .
miss?
thank you .
stop it .
stop it .
what's the matter with you?
come on .
commercial isn't so bad .
there's got to be room for one more .
will you pull yourself together?
thank you .
would you like a vicodin?
jimmy , being in your movie is a privilege .
in fact , it's more than a privilege .
it's a real privilege .
can i ...
do you mind if i call you back in a few minutes?
ok , thank you , sir .
you ok?
mm hmm .
i'm just a little nervous for some reason .
i have a little nervous feeling in my ... self .
but that's only natural , right?
yeah .
this is a pretty huge thing im doing .
kind of a great leap of faith .
but i have that faith in you .
so im fine .
it's going to be great .
good .
can't you tell by my smile?
which one is it?
what?
what number smile is it?
it's ...
wait , it was one .
no , one was when something really made me laugh .
right?
one and a half .
rosie ...
i didn't know about your six smiles .
pete told me about them .
he made me swear i wasn't going to break your heart , or he would tear me to pieces , either with his bare hands or his rhetoric .
i stole the speech from pete to get you to come here with me .
i lied .
and im sorry .
and i know you're going to be very upset .
i just ...
pete told you about the six smiles?
yeah .
and made you swear that you wouldn't break my heart?
or he'd tear you to pieces , with either his bare hands or his rhetoric?
yeah .
that is just so ...
adorable .
what?
do you think it's possible to love someone your whole life and never really realize it until something happens that makes you see?
what's that from?
no , it's not from anything .
i'm just saying it to you .
wow .
man , what a week .
fell in love for the first time , got my heart broken for the first time , was honorable for the first time .
got bit in the ass for being honorable for the first time .
bought a farm .
i'm sorry about the broken heart part .
do you think you could take me home now?
yeah .
thank you .
cathy .
rosie?
where's pete?
he's not here .
what are you doing?
what do you mean?
he's always here .
he's pete .
no .
he didn't come in today .
can i borrow your car?
yes .
thank you .
pete .
pete .
not pete .
wow .
i'm just here because pete asked me to box up some stuff .
why?
where's he going?
richmond .
and he isn't going .
he's gone .
he's gone to richmond?
why?
i cannot believe i am taking my work home with me .
when great love is rejected , rosalee , something inside a man dies .
so all he can do is run away , where he can meet the girl he'll love second most .
unless ...
unless what?
unless you can get to him before he closes the book on you .
but once it's closed , it's closed .
it's finished .
it's gone , dead .
it's crushed .
it's beaten .
it's buried .
it is lost for all of time in a sea ...
angelica .
ok , yeah .
i owe you .
go .
if you've been dumped , give us a call on late night talk .
let's go to line one .
scott , you're on ...
what?
pass me .
pete .
pete .
are you ok?
yeah .
no ...
no , i meant to do that .
you have five smiles , pete .
one when you think someone's an idiot .
one when you think someone's really an idiot .
one when you're getting all dressed up .
one when you're singing barry white .
and one ... when you're looking at me .
for all you lovers out there , this one's for you .
i can't believe im going to say this , but ...
would you like to dance?
