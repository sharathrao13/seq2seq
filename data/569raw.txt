sharkboy was not always half shark . half boy .
he was a marine biologist or . at least . in training .
his father studied great white sharks and called his son " sharkboy " because of how much he loved to care for the sharks .
he made them sushi and had given them all names .
goodmilk .
peggy .
eggbat ... and crackett .
but one day an incredible . mysterious storm appeared .
it swept away the entire laboratory .
sharkboy !
thanks to their life rafts .
sharkboy and his father survived .
but they survived on different sides of the wreckage . each floating off in a different direction .
sharkboy !
sharkboy was completely alone .
almost completely .
but one of the sharks recognized him .
hey , it's sharkboy .
don't take a bite outta him , boys he's a friend .
they took sharkboy to their cave home . where he'd be safe and dry .
his new family were sharks .
hundreds of sharks .
the sharks raised him as one of their own . training him in the ways of the shark .
you must keep moving to survive .
always go forward , never back .
to live by instinct and instinct alone .
eventually he grew gills . and sharp talons for claws .
his teeth sharpened themselves to a point .
he grew fins all sorts of fins .
but that was years ago .
i first met sharkboy while fishing on the dock this summer .
he seemed lost .
you have to get a job !
no , i have a job !
so i snuck him home ...
then maybe you should just leave . ... when my parents were too busy to notice .
i kept him fed and in water .
he had been traveling the universe in search of his father .
he told me of his latest adventures on a planet so cool it makes you drool .
he said i too could go to planet drool someday .
then one night i was visited by a glowing light .
an amazing girl with purple flames for hair and skin of molten lava rock appeared .
i called her ...
lavagirl .
she smiled at me . for that seemed to be her name .
she told me she needed sharkboy to return to planet drool with her . for a great crisis was developing .
she asked if i could go with them .
i told her .
i have school tomorrow .
she gave me a sad look and flamed away . taking sharkboy with her .
i haven 't seen sharkboy or lavagirl since then .
and that'swhat i did this summer ..
enough !
someone is picking that up .
and it's not gonna be me !
we were supposed to tell true stories .
that is a true story .
does lavagirl have special powers?
there's no such thing as lavagirl .
she can ...
she can shoot lava out of her hands .
cool .
how many people think max's story is true?
not true .
made up .
not true .
it's just a made up story .
if it's true , why don't you bring sharkboy and lavagirl to class tomorrow?
they went away .
i don't know where they went .
have a seat , max .
linus , you're next .
this summer , i met a new friend ... who was half dork , half boy .
i called him dorkboy .
but his real name was max .
we had him for dinner , but he stunk so bad that we all blew chunks .
that's enough , linus .
linus , max , stay .
come on , mr. e !
class , what's my name?
mr. electricidad .
mr. electricidad , exactly .
not mr. electric , not mr. electrici tha tha tha tha .
linus , you just earned a minus for your behavior today .
this is a new year .
do you think you can be friends?
no .
then it's been decided : you'll be the best of friends .
which means no more picking on max , linus .
max .
you're in the fourth grade .
there are some good kids in this class .
find them .
make friends with them .
dreaming keeps you from seeing what's right here in front of you .
this isn't a dream .
this is the real world .
lost my train of thought .
no dreaming .
got it .
i'll try harder .
what do you have there?
it's my dream journal .
it has all of my most precious dreams in it .
i'll never part with it for as long as i live .
you're a good kid , max .
max !
let's be imaginary friends .
you can try and hang with us ... and we'll pretend you don't exist !
check it out .
sharkboy gets shocked by electric eels , and then they feed on his cooked flesh .
wow , linus .
your skills are ... weak .
ohh ...
i'm gonna burst your bubble , dream boy .
you're dead !
get the book !
give me the book .
hand over the book , or you'll visit the dream world !
ooh ...
agh haa ...
all right !
gotit !
i'll bring you a revised edition tomorrow .
max . wake up !
dream .
max .
open your eyes .
max .
eyes open . and dream .
stay dreaming .
wake up !
sharkboy !
and lavagiril
hyah !
max !
my cookies !
my giant cookies !
what are you doing baking sweets?
you know what happens when he eats sugar .
i baked them for his class .
so you could make friends at school , and now you've eaten all of them .
no , it was sharkboy and lavagirl !
look this one has shark bites , and this one is singed .
there's no such thing as sharkboy and lavagirl .
well , i believe him .
your mother's right .
when you go to sleep and close your eyes , they may come back .
but when you open 'em again , sharkgirl and lavaboy'll be ... ... outta here .
but ...
shh .
mouth closed , eyes closed .
now?
yes , now .
you can wait till you're in bed to close your eyes , max .
kids need their dreams .
kids ... need to grow up !
he's not making any friends with these cookies !
there's no such thing as sharkboy and lavagirl .
there's no such thing as sharkboy and lavagirl .
yes , there is .
stupid plugs !
please don't let me have to go to school .
they'll make fun of me , i know it !
i wish i could just escape this loser world and go to planet drool .
games and toys and laughs and fun ...
may there be terrible storms , rain , sleet , snow , tornadoes ... so i can lay here all day tomorrow and dream of drool .
guess i didn't dream hard enough .
there are plenty of good opportunities .
you just need to look .
ooh , traffic engineer !
hey .
i was cleaning out my closet and look what i found .
remember tobor?
the robot you tried to build?
why were you cleaning out your closet?
i had to find one of these .
is mom making you get a real job again?
writing is a real job .
when it pays .
max , i'm walking you to school today .
so what do you say?
wanna finish making tobor?
it won't work .
well , how do you know?
'cause you told me it wouldn't .
i did?
i'm sorry .
i should've never said that .
it's ok .
you were right .
dumb idea .
how did these happen?
the grass was dead anyway .
why are you so morbid?
i just wish anything could happen so i wouldn't have to go to school today .
that's not realistic , max .
it's bad enough your father's head is in the clouds , but not you too , ok?
just push that dream aside and move on .
like with your dream?
the one about you and dad and me?
well , i do have a dream about us , but , as i'm sure you've been noticing lately , your father and i are just ...
well , we're ... not compatible .
sorry .
i don't mean to dump all this on you right before you have to go to school , but ... school's waiting .
did we have to move so close to school?
your father thought we'd save money on gas .
come right home after school today , 'cause there's some things we need to talk about .
i love you .
i wish anything could happen so i wouldn't have to come home today .
hey , look , it's dream boy !
who knows where tornadoes come from?
well , when cold air mixes with hot air , it can form a tornado , as the hot and cold chase each other around and around and around .
i dreamt of a story kind of like sharkboy and lavagirl lce girl and dream boy .
her powers come from her crystal heart .
no more fairy tales .
piranha girl and beluga boy .
plastic boy and metal girl .
barf boy and vomit girl .
does everyone hear me?
i'm a teacher , right?
wrong .
i'm an awakener .
only i'm finding it more and more difficult to keep my class ... awake .
no recess again for you , marissa too many allergies .
there are more boogers on your work than there is work .
i'm just cold .
i'll be happy to change places with you .
it's a lot warmer back there in my spot .
but i ... have to sit up front .
it's just that you're sitting right under the vent .
it's august and you're sneezing .
you're gonna get me in trouble .
max .
are you ... trying to make real friends?
trying , like you told me to .
that's good .
just not with my daughter , ok?
no !
it wasn't like that .
it's just ...
sit down , max .
give me back my journal !
class has begun .
everyone in your seats .
linus took my journal !
i did not !
minus !
i mean , linus .
you get a minus for misconduct .
give max back his journal .
one more time , linus , and we'll have to change your name to minus .
he ruined my dream journal !
i did not !
mr. electric , send him to the principal's office and have him expelled !
you're in my class , not the other way around !
i know everything and you know nothing !
at the end of class , both of you report to the principal's office !
with your parents !
everybody down !
it's them !
i'm looking for max .
she's hot !
whoa !
we need your help , max .
come with us .
what do i have to do?
go with us to planet drool .
we'll explain on the way .
we're going to planet drool?
it's my home planet .
just outside our solar system .
you should know , max you made it up .
i can't go with you .
why not?
because you're not real .
both of you are just a dream .
and when i open my eyes , you'll be gone .
we're still here , max .
if you wanna stop the darkness from destroying our worlds , come with us .
you better go with them .
ok ...
i'll go .
everyone follow me and we'll find shelter .
i can't believe i'm finally getting to ditch this place and go to planet drool !
how are we getting there?
put these on , everybody .
blue goggles for the boys , pink for the girls .
do you have another pair of boy goggles?
uh uh .
so , how do you fly it?
you don't know?
duh !
that's sort of been the whole problem !
you press go .
now , how do you fly it?
it's got an autopilot .
you just thought of everything , didn't you , max?
not exactly .
how do we land it?
that's the part i never thought of !
jupiter ...
saturn ...
neptune ...
you might wanna hold on to something .
recognize your dream world , max?
not really .
i feel like i should , but i just don't .
it's affecting him too .
i thought he would just remember .
remember what?
your dreams .
this planet?
us .
your powers .
i have powers?
more than any of us .
don't you know that?
everything that is or was , began with a dream .
and you dreamt us , max .
us and this whole place .
i did?
every dream you ever had landed right here on planet drool .
why is it so dark?
the planet is dying .
it began yesterday .
what's the calculation , sharkboy?
45 minutes till the darkness destroys planet drool .
we didn't go to earth to save you .
max .
we need you to save planet drool .
but how
the dream lair is on the other side of the planet .
that's where your dreams are going bad .
we have to go there and reverse it .
we have to travel through the passage of time , catch the train of thought , swim down the stream of consciousness and skate across the sea of confusion now covered in ice .
why'd you do that , max?
why'd you freeze the ocean?
i ...
ouch !
max didn't mean to do it .
did you , max?
max is a good boy , otherwise you and i would be evil , and we're not evil .
i'm not evil , am i , max?
i don't think so .
that's why we brought you here to put things back in order .
we just have to stay positive .
it's not the end of the world .
not yet , it's not .
the darkness !
run !
this is like a bad dream !
oh , yeah?
just wait till you meet mr. electric !
he's the worst bad dream yet !
where is everyone?
mostly trapped on mount neverrest .
by mr. electric .
but planet drool's a place for kids to dream and have endless fun !
it's endless fun , all right .
once you get on ...
... you can't get off .
kids aren't allowed to rest ,
'cause if they rest , they sleep , and if they sleep , they dream .
and if they dream ...
it takes power away from mr. electric .
but we're gonna stop him with our secret weapon .
shouldn't we save those kids first?
why can't i do that?
lavagirl !
hooray !
who knows where mr. electric is hiding?
everyone?
they're not raising their hands .
you're all upside down .
ah .
who is stopping my unstoppable coasters?
back in your seats !
go !
run !
hide !
let's get outta here !
everyone back in your seats !
who's mr. electric?
he's supposed to provide light to the planet . but all he brings now is darkness .
fun has begun !
he's taking us up !
my home !
at half its normal power .
he's taking us down .
show time !
keep playing !
never stop !
games and toys and laughs ... hey hey hey ... and fun !
well , well , well .
if it isn't sharkboy and lavagirl .
what are you doing halting my endless fun coaster and infiltrating my lair?
we don't need permission from you .
fiery !
i don't believe we've met .
i'm mr. electric !
why are you bringing misery to our planet?
you're supposed to be running it .
you're supposed to be running it .
i am running it right into the ground .
those are my orders .
who ordered that?
no school , no discipline , no rules .
and , most important , no dreams .
dreams can destroy you , can't they?
my instincts tell me that is so .
really?
that's why we have to stop you .
you and what army?
now now .
ha ha ha haa !
pee pee pee pee ...
feel the burn !
agh ...
not for real .
aaah !
ha ha !
internal radar , shark like reflexes ...
you're amazing !
but is it enough to defeat mr. electric?
we have our secret weapon , remember?
did you really believe you could stop me?
oh ...
ah ...
i knowwe can't .
but he can .
take it away , max .
show him what you're made of , max .
what am i supposed to do?
i told you this would happen .
i thought he would just remember .
remember what? !
the dream .
remember the dream .
i don't remember half my dreams .
that's why i write them in my dream journal .
what half of your dreams do you remember?
this one i remember .
where are you taking us?
where all useless dreams go to the dream graveyard !
whoa !
ploop !
cuckoo !
well , at least we're on the passage of time .
maybe it'll take us to the dream lair .
it's going in the wrong direction .
the dream lair's that way .
what's in the dream lair?
it's where all the dreams that fuel planet drool are stored .
but they're being destroyed .
how that's what we have to find out .
soon even sharkboy and i will cease to exist .
duck !
max , where is your dream journal?
great thinking , sharkie !
we can read his dreams out loud and turn everything back to the way it was .
i may even realize my true identity .
i threw it away .
my journal's back on earth .
we really thought you were the answer , max .
don't listen to him .
he's just upset because you didn't show up and make him king of the ocean , with a giant fish army to back him up .
look who's talking !
you thought you'd find a great use for your powers and heal the planet .
max thought his dream world would be a happy place .
we've all been duped .
ohh !
i think you broke my fin .
sorry .
hey , you !
i see you hiding !
come back here !
i was awakened !
i'm sorry .
did all the children from mount neverrest escape?
it was sharkboy and lavagirl .
but i took care of it see?
someone was with them?
just another child afraid of his own shadow .
no threat to us .
i banished him to the dream graveyard .
where old dreams lie?
he could find an ally !
i told you , every dream must be smashed , every child captured !
you want him back , we'll simply track him when he falls asleep .
fool !
he's the daydreamer .
and the moment he realizes it will be the moment of our doom !
now what do you want me to do?
bring me the boy before he discovers his true powers and tears my new kingdom apart !
plugs , redirect the darkness .
and ...
bring me the plughounds !
we'll never find our way out of this graveyard .
darkness !
headed this way !
sit down , max .
what for?
close your eyes and dream .
if max can't remember his dreams , maybe he can redream them .
he could dream us out of here .
dream , max .
now , what do you see?
i see a ... giant ... chocolate chunk marshmallow cookie ... with lots of warm milk .
sorry .
i'm starving .
here's some food .
you're not gonna like that .
i'm so hungry i could eat lava rocks .
what is that? !
lava rocks .
here , have some real food .
fresh sushi .
it'll knock you right out .
that's not fresh .
i'm not even sure that's sushi anymore .
it's just a few weeks old .
i'll cook it for you .
oops .
it's ok .
i'm not that hungry anymore .
let me just rest a moment .
maybe i can sleep .
it's getting closer .
get outta here !
max , i know you've got a lot to figure out , but if you happen to dream about who i am and how i fit into this world , it would really be helpful for me ...
no distractions .
you steer him off course , we could be lost in a sea of dreams .
i'm sorry .
i'm desperate .
focus on the problem at hand .
max needs to dream us out of here , so how about i put him to sleep?
no , sharkboy .
just one punch .
he'll be out like a light .
i've seen this before .
it's on the tip of my ... finger .
it's a hand !
it is a hand .
ahand?
anotherhand .
yep?
it's tobor !
who?
tobor !
i dreamt him up when i was a kid a robot that could help me with my homework .
i tried to build him once .
everyone kept telling me he would never work .
so here he is a forgotten dream in the dream graveyard .
maybe he can help us .
he's supposed to be very smart .
tobor , awake !
yes?
he works !
we can ask him anything now .
let me , let me !
tell me something about me .
i'm clueless .
actually , you are extremely bright .
am i king oftheocean , orwhat?
no .
sorry .
how do i save planet drool?
the answer is in your dreams .
you mean if i put him to sleep , he'll dream us out of this mess?
no .
at least , not here .
darkness is falling .
any dream of his would become a nightmare and you don't want those becoming a reality .
but if you go to the land of milk and cookies ...
of course ! ... that's where the good dreams are .
where the answers are .
it's perfect .
max .
the land of milk and cookies is a safe , sweet place .
you'll be able to dream easily there .
can you take us?
i have no body .
i can't move .
you can move your eyes and your mouth .
why didn't you work back on earth , tobor?
some dreams are so powerful they become real like sharkboy and lavagirl .
i , on the other hand , am still only a dream .
oh ...
what's wrong?
train of thought ...
i'm losing it .
you were taking us to the land of milk and cookies , remember?
i mean i'm literally losing the train of thought .
it's down there .
that's the train of thought?
how do i keep it on track?
with your mind .
the train of thought gets easily distracted .
stay focused , and it'll speed you directly to the land of milk and cookies .
the rest is up to you .
sorry i forgot about you , tobor .
are you kidding?
you just saved me .
i'm free !
max , get down here !
what's wrong?
we can't control it .
all you have to do is keep it on track .
how can you keep it on track if there is no track?
looks like another dream gone bad !
what do we do?
yell?
scream?
jump .
it'll be all right .
what does it mean when your train of thought ... wrecks?
well ...
it can't be good , buddy .
how much time do we have , sharkboy?
20 minutes .
eww !
stick to rotten fish , please !
chocolate !
i stepped in chocolate !
we're here .
the land of milk and cookies !
oh , yeah !
the milk is warm .
he'll be out in no time .
lay down .
here's a marshmallow pillow .
how about dreaming us into the dream lair?
the ground is thumping too much .
my highly trained ears hear it too .
boom , boom , boom .
let me hear it .
i wouldn't .
hothead .
when you dreamt up these giant cookies , who did you expect to be able to eat them?
i really didn't think about it .
'cause if you dream giant cookies , something has to be created to consume giant cookies .
cookie giants !
ohh ...
frosting .
those giants almost look like my parents .
they seem happy together .
is that your dream?
we had a dream we're family .
it hasn't been coming true lately .
most dreams don't come true on their own .
you have to make them true .
it takes a lot of work .
not easy .
but not impossible either .
stinking fresh air !
blinding sunlight !
oh , how i long for a sky of fluorescent lights !
ahh ...
better stand back .
all right , thatwas me .
still empty handed , i see .
if you're so powerful , you find him .
that's your job !
do it , or i'll have you discharged !
shh ...
someone is dreaming in here .
all right , max , you've had your cookies and milk .
now go to sleep .
i'll try .
go to sleep !
not like that .
sing him a lullaby .
# dream , dream , dream , dream ...
your turn .
# close your eyes , shut your mouth , dream a dream and get us out
# dream , dream , dream , dream , dream , dream # hit the hay , fast asleep , dream a dream , you little bleep
# dream , dream , dream , dream , dream , dream
it's working !
keep it up , sharkboy .
# just relax , lay about , or my fist will put you out
# dream , dream , dream , dream , dream , dream # take your time , but beware , there's darkness in the air
# dream , dream , dream , dream , dream , dream dream about me next , max .
i need to knowwho i am .
not just destruction or a simple flame .
dream of me as something good .
# don't despair , step right up glass of water?
here's a cup
# dream , dream , dream , dream , dream , dream he's having a nightmare !
wake up , max !
wake up !
stop that racket , sharkboy you're giving him nightmares !
sorry , max .
arghl
ow !
ohh ...
what was that for?
your nightmare was about me , wasn't it?
i don't remember .
but i did dream about one thing ...
plughounds !
this may come as a shock to you .
feel the power !
it's empty !
fudge .
i forgot to dream of gas .
max !
my powers are weakening .
watch the power lines very dangerous .
yaaarrhh !
yaaarrhh !
sharkboy , get me down from here !
can't you see i'm busy?
hot lava ...
hot lava ...
i don't got much fight left in me , max .
where's lavagirl?
it's up to you now .
max .
dream us out of here .
we believe in you , max .
shark boat with turbo boosters !
shark boat with turbo boosters !
a banana split? !
still hungry , max?
how about a knuckle sandwich?
no , look !
it's a banana split boat !
then let's split !
ow !
huh?
catch you later .
all dreamers mustdream .
this is great , max .
you're starting to daydream .
keep that up . and they'll never get us .
why not?
learn to dream with your eyes open , and you won't have to be asleep to dream .
you'll be able to make anything happen at any time .
# row , row , row your banana split boat gently down the stream of consciousness
# merrily , merrily , merrily , merrily
# life is max's dream
sugar will give you nightmares .
how much time do we have?
don't ask .
the dream lair's across the ocean of lce .
we'll have to travel there by foot .
what was it you saw in your dream , max?
i saw an object shaped like ...
give me something to draw with .
the crystal heart !
that's the treasure of the land of lce !
in the lce castle .
it can freeze anything even time .
i've always dreamt of freezing a moment in time .
and the lce castle's ruled by the lce princess .
i hear she's the most beautiful girl on the planet .
ouch !
she is not !
she's cold and cruel and cares for nobody but herself .
she's just saying that , max .
have you met her?
no .
but i know we don't get along .
how do you know that?
i'm fire .
she's ice .
we must be enemies .
we need that crystal heart .
but i need you both to get it .
i just hope this isn't a trap .
whoa !
if we freeze time with the crystal heart , we'll be able to make it to the dream lair and save the planet .
that's the plan .
behold the lce castle !
home to the princess of the land of lce .
the crystal heart's inside the castle?
so they say .
let's go .
it's no use !
i'll melt the bridge .
this place inflames me .
can you cool down enough to get across?
i'd have to be asleep to do that .
can you try sleepwalking?
my dream is to live on earth but someplace warm and that earth will accept me , even ... if i ... destroy ... everything i ... touch !
no , lavagirl !
don't sneeze !
aaa tchoo !
aarghh ...
look .
she's sleeping .
they've found us again !
lavagirl !
shh !
if you wake her up , she'll reheat .
she can make it .
lavagirl , they're behind you !
let's go .
hurry !
argh !
it's a trap !
you can almost feel the electricity in the air , can't you?
this is all wrong .
someone else's dreams are in here .
lights out !
welcome to the dream lair !
i am the ruler of planet drool .
no , you're not !
max is !
max may have dreamed it originally ... but i am much ... cooler .
i ... am minus .
how'd you get so powerful?
i do a lot of reading .
my book of dreams !
that's why everything's so messed up he's changing it !
electric eels .
shocking , isn't it , sharkboy?
reminds me of the time that electrical storm blew apart your father's laboratory .
where is my father?
hm .
let's see .
check the bottom of the ocean .
and lavagirl ...
once i figure out how to freeze this planet's core , all of your powers will disappear .
powers?
what powers?
and lastbutleast , max
you thought you could escape fear by running away to dreamland .
but fear exists in the one place you can never escape !
your mind !
i will show you the true meaning of fear .
when darkness falls , the rest of your dreams will be destroyed and i will rule planet drool .
blah blah blah , threat threat threat ...
you must all leave now .
i have some dreaming to do .
whoa !
if i could just get my dream journal ,
i could turn everything back to the way it was .
my fire's dimming .
i can't melt the bars .
my strength is failing me as well .
how much time do we have , sharkboy?
who cares?
we're never getting out of here .
la la's .
they like you .
i don't feel distracted right now .
i do !
this song is driving me crazy !
don't worry about him .
he's a cold fish .
i'm serious !
they're singing at a frequency ... my highly trained ears find ... disturbing !
sing louder .
sing higher .
you don't wanna be too close to him when he explodes .
aaargghhl
shark frenzy !
nice job channeling your anger , sharkie .
huh .
first things first .
transportation out of here .
my dreams .
lavagirl , you have a lava bike !
i do?
i do !
this is so exciting !
cool it , lavagirl .
everything we need is right here in this book .
sharkboy ... your father really is at the bottom of the ocean .
he's in a submarine .
looking for you !
he's over the hydrothermal vents , mid atlantic ridge , 42 degrees west by 1 4 north .
1 800 meters .
near a snake pit !
i need to get back to earth .
what's it say about me?
i'm not sure what this is .
i can figure it out .
maybe there's a section on my true identity .
lavagirl , no !
oh , no .
what have i done?
that's terrific , lg !
it's ok , lavagirl .
it was an accident .
why did you make me out of lava? !
why , max?
just let her cool down .
she's just blowing off steam .
i know i can be good .
i can feel it .
but everything i touch , i destroy .
why did you make me like that?
i have more potential .
i'm sure you do .
and why'd you make us a team?
we're nothing alike .
when i'm near water , i fizzle out .
when he's near heat , he shrivels .
we're not compatible .
your ... hair's on fire .
yeah , it does that .
thanks , sharkie .
maybe i really am evil .
so far everything else you've dreamed has been correct .
maybe i just need to learn to accept it .
that's it !
everything i've dreamt so far has been correct .
the crystal heart !
yeah , we were captured , but that's 'cause minus doesn't want me to get it .
we have to get back to the lce castle .
1 0 minutes left .
we'll never make it !
we can do it !
how?
you're sharkboy and lavagirl .
you can do anything .
wake up !
what?
he escaped .
and he's getting the crystal heart .
shut it down .
shut it all down now !
i did .
it's on a grid system .
it takes time for the darkness to travel .
how soon?
not soon enough .
then destroy him .
how?
sharkboy and lavagirl .
is that what you saw , max?
yes .
you'll have to climb the ice pillar and get it .
it's as delicate as a snowflake , so don't drop it .
and don't touch it with your hands either you'll freeze .
use your claws .
aaarrhh ...
lava , can you ...?
never mind .
chew on some ice .
it'll keep you cool .
hm .
great job , max .
i got it !
she's frozen solid !
kneel before the lce princess .
you tried to steal the crystal heart .
why?
we believe it can freeze time .
long enough for us to defeat minus .
my crystal heart cannot help you .
only i have the power to use it .
then come with us .
she can never leave this castle .
the crystal is the only thing that protects our kingdom .
please , princess .
we're running out of time .
perhaps i could give it to you .
not without my blessing .
father , you're smothering me again .
but are you worthy to wield it?
yes .
the crystal you stole was a decoy .
the true crystal heart is somewhere in this room .
choose the correct one , and you may carry it before you .
pick that one .
it's around your neck .
how'd you know?
i saw it in my dream .
usually , if you snooze , you lose .
with max , you snooze , you win .
but be warned , max , if anything happens to my crystal heart , my entire kingdom will be destroyed .
do you , max , take this crystal heart to have and to hold , in sickness and in health , till death do you part?
i do .
do you trust him with your heart?
i do .
do you mean what you say?
yes .
i mean , i do .
the crystal will now work but my daughter must stay here .
off with you , then !
good luck .
we're almost at the dream lair !
if we're gonna do this , we gotta do it now !
how much time?
we're out of time !
1 0 seconds !
what?
i can't hear you .
five seconds .
here it goes .
three , two , one ...
we're out of time .
what happened?
it didn't work .
how could it not work?
i was trying to tell you !
whoa ...
only the lce princess can use it .
it's not her fault her father won't let her leave her castle .
boo hoo .
no underwater readings .
no anything !
i'll rip your sockets to shreds !
calm down , sharkboy .
mr. electric's baiting you .
i can't ... fight ... my instincts !
no , sharkboy !
hey !
watts ... up?
you know watts .
as in a measure of electrical power .
the 60 watt bulb?
watts up?
what?
electric eels .
that's what's up .
swim away , sharkboy !
swim away !
can he survive down there?
he can hold his breath , but not forever .
he'll drown if i don't go get him .
i can't let you go .
you'll die too .
he's my best friend .
come on , sharkboy .
come on , sharkboy !
sharkboy !
wake up , sharkboy !
lavagirl !
lavagirl !
lavagirl , please !
lavagirl ...
what am i gonna do now?
what do you think you should do?
dream a better dream .
interesting .
explain .
i wanted all my dreams to come true , but i only dreamt for myself .
i wanted to escape my real world . when the world needed my help to make it a better place .
selfish dreams shouldn't come true .
you're becoming a very good dreamer , max .
a very good dreamer indeed .
what do you do when your dreams have been destroyed?
dream a better dream .
an unselfsish dream .
she knew this would happen if she saved you .
but i couldn't stop her .
look !
lava .
we have to get her to that volcano .
i'll go .
i'm stronger and faster .
you'll burn up .
sure this will save her?
it'll do more than save her .
i know who you are , lavagirl .
you are not fire . or a simple flame .
you are greater than that .
something more important . and so necessary .
it is why you must live .
you are not destruction .
you are not evil .
stand back .
you are ...
iight .
who turned on the lights? !
oh !
power , everywhere !
whoa !
how'd you get here so fast?
hold off mr. electric while i deal with minus .
i'll need my fish army .
i'll unfreeze the ocean .
good luck .
i've become what you feared most ...
minus .
how did you get in here?
i'm the daydreamer , able to dream with my eyes open .
hate to burst your bubble , dream boy , but i read your book .
there's not one dream you've got that i haven't already seen .
so what do you say?
let's blow the roof off this place .
may the best dream win !
wait !
brainstorm !
eugh !
brain ... freeze !
brain ... fart !
oh ...
get ready for the ultimate power outage .
and who are you to believe that you can defeat me now?
no one special .
just ... king of the ocean .
ooh ...
shark frenzy .
aaarhh ...
aaarhh ...
aaarhh ...
a ha !
you're afraid of me , aren't you?
i used to be .
someone smashed your dreams once now all you can do is smash everyone else's .
we can create a better dream than this .
a better world .
don't you see?
what do you say ...
linus?
hurry !
no !
don't let me fall !
wouldn't dream of it .
don't smash people's dreams , linus , because you'll smash your own as well .
and you too will stop believing .
max !
i am light .
thank you .
you were always that .
it had nothing to do with me .
but now i know .
so thank you .
ok , so she's a light .
big deal .
the real news is ... what i am .
annoying?
king of the ocean .
thanks for saving me .
ouch .
everything will return to being the way it was .
you will be able to travel to earth and back again as you wish .
you can search for your father .
you can rule earth's lava world .
and what am i to do , now that you're all buddy buddy?
mr. electric can go back to being the good electrician of the planet .
oh , really?
plugging in power cords?
keeping this loud , obnoxious world a happy place?
you're dreaming !
i dreamt you up , and i can undream you .
you think you can just snap your eyes open and make me vanish?
not so easy .
i am the danger of dreaming .
for every person who dreams up the electric light bulb , there's the one who dreams up the atom bomb .
this is one dream you won't be waking up from .
i'm gonna put an end to this ridiculous tangent at its source !
where did he go?
he's headed to earth .
he's going to try and destroy you in your sleep .
in my sleep?
you mean i'm asleep?
all this time i've been asleep?
no .
you're dreaming , max .
with your eyes open .
make the dream real .
you can live out your dreams on earth .
just like you made us real .
make it real .
blink your eyes three times .
one ...
wait .
what happens when ...?
two ...
will i ever see you again?
three .
everyone follow me , i said !
we've got to find shelter !
max , get up !
there's a tornado heading our way !
it's not a tornado .
it's much worse than that .
linus , wake up !
look !
charge !
it's mr. electric from planet drool !
the one from my dreams !
you mean ... this is real?
your dream is real?
some dreams are so powerful they become real .
i don't believe it .
it's right there in front of you !
i can see that !
what i can't believe is you dreamt me as a big round bad guy !
i'm not bad !
sorry .
kinda took on a life of its own .
max is in building c.
no , he's not .
he's in building w.
that was the other school !
aaarhhl
help !
find max !
tell him i love him !
don't leave me !
i thought you wanted me to leave .
no , i don't .
you're my best friend .
i love you .
i love you too .
aaarghl
come back !
please , come back .
i'm not going anywhere .
neither am l .
aah ... aarghl
uh oh .
aaargghhl
ok , class .
i'm just a teacher , and i'm here to inspire the answers from you .
and i think that's some pretty good inspiration outside .
so this is now a pop quiz .
we need to defeat that guy .
any ideas?
wow , linus .
you get a plus for being the first hand in the air .
i can take him .
linus , watch out !
poop .
aaargh !
ohh ...
nice try .
sorry , max .
your journal .
it's ok .
it was an accident .
plenty more dreams where those came from .
ok , kids , who's next?
remember , there are no dumb ideas .
maybe we can freeze his circuits .
that's the dumbest idea i ever heard .
we're in the middle of texas in august !
next idea?
anyone but linus .
wait that's a great idea !
thanks , linus .
come here , marissa .
is this yours?
how'd you find it?
so you've seen this?
yes , but ... only in a dream .
it can freeze anything .
even time .
what are you doing?
you're not sending my daughter out there .
let her out .
electrical storm headed your way !
do you know what to do?
i believe so .
stand back .
oh , who do we have here?
get ready for the mega hurts !
get it?
hertz?
as in the unit of electrical frequency?
you're just not paying attention in class , are you?
ooh !
whoa !
awesome !
he's unplugged .
yeah !
you made me a great teacher today .
how did i do that?
a great teacher learns as much from his students as they do from him .
you have ... awakened me .
thank you , max .
max .
your report , please .
the following story is true .
it might have started as a dream , but , as we saw yesterday , when we make our dreams a reality ... reality becomes a dream .
sharkboy lives his dream as king of the ocean . where he cares for all its creatures .
he searches for his father's submarine where there is no light except in one place . where light shines almost as bright as the sun .
it's where lavagirl lives her dream . as queen of earth's volcanoes that boil at the bottom of the sea . a force of life for all living things .
sharkboy and lavagirl don't visit me anymore .
but i can visit them in my dreams .
so dream a better dream ... then work to make it real .
yes?
