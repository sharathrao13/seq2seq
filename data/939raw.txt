wkcc am talk radio .
all talk , all the time .
bringing you sports and weather on the five .
church leaders blame the rise of hate crimes and racially motivated attacks ... ... on a militia like group calling themselves " the holnists .
one of the most radical and powerful of these groups ... ... claims as its founder , the famed motivational speaker nathan holn .
the last of the great cities died ... ... when my father was a child ... ... victims of yet another war .
he told of the plagues that followed ... ... and how the living hid themselves , scattered in tiny hamlets ... ... in hopes of surviving whatever new madness ... ... conspired to rob them of the little that remained .
in those days , he walked alone ... ... a solitary witness to the chaos that reigned .
the earth itself had fallen victim to the insanity .
he told stories of the 3 year winter ... ... and how the dirty snow never stopped falling .
he saw the ocean , barren , poisoned , near death .
and how they watched the sky for 16 long years ... ... praying for the great lungs to start working again .
he said it was as if the ocean had breathed a great sigh of relief .
many commuters are abandoning their vehicles .

i know the rule .
it's my rule .
avoid civilization at all cost .
we got to eat , don't we?
open your mouth .
it's true we haven't done this for awhile but . . . . . . for god sakes , it's like riding a bicycle , bill .

all you got to do is stand there .
i'm the one with all the lines .

awful .
just awful .
they said , " fear not , macbeth . . . . . . till birnam wood . . . . . . comes to dunsinane .

and tomorrow . . . .
tomorrow .
and the day after that .
out , brief candle !
life's but a walking shadow . . . . . . a poor player who struts . . . . . . and frets his hour upon a stage . . . . . . and is heard no more .
it's a tale told by . . . .
idiot .
a moron . . . . . . full of sound and fury . . . . . . signifying . . .
. . . nothing .
but blow , wind !
come , wrack !
at least we'll die . . .
. . . with the harness off our back !
i want to talk to him .
the children have never seen shakespeare before .
they still haven't .
thank you .
you're very kind .
i'm clapping because you stink .
larry !
i don't think you know how it works .
when i was young , i tried to be an actor .
i was awful .
but now i won't die thinking i was the worst one .
stop it !
that's all right .
how much did you pay to get in?
so bite me .
you were very good .
good enough to get something to eat?
yes , we have some soup .
holnists .
goddamn !
bastards hardly kill anyone lately .
we give them food and supplies .
all the towns do .
i'd just as soon not give them anything of mine , thanks .
what are you doing there?
what are you doing?
it's just a game , general bethlehem .
it's something they saw in a play .
no harm in it .
wait a minute !
a play?
show me .
it's all right , children .
show me .
arm yourselves .
no running from the witches .
shakespeare , is it?
i'm sorry i missed it .
we haven't nearly stocked the game that we thought we would .
really?
but you had time for a play?
i'm taking 3 conscripts . . . . . . from each town !
they will have the honor of serving in the holnist army . . . . . . until such time as i see fit !
3 men .
could you do that?
captain !
all men . . . . . . between 1 5 and 50 . . . . . . and of suitable ethnic foundation are required to show themselves now !
general .
no , but keep that .
acceptable .
sir?
acceptable , captain .
need some meat on you , but i like an impressionable mind .
acceptable .
mongoloid .
unacceptable .
i want pure blood .
someone . . . .
someone . . . .
don't wave .
people , you will look at me !
someone like . . . .
like that man !
you don't understand .
you were required to show yourself .
i'm not with them .
i'm just passing through .
take the mule .
let's go !
move !
ten hut !
i want a line right here .
welcome , gentlemen , to your new life .
you have been born again as soldiers in the united army of nathan holn .
god rest his soul !
the strong have been sapped . . . . . . by the whimpering propaganda of the weak .
men . . . . . . strong men , have been denied their destiny .
you men have been saved from that fate .
redemption . . . . . . is within your grasp .
you .
what did you do before you were given this opportunity?
i had a shovel .
i digged holes .
you digged holes .
now you'll fill them .
and you?
me?
is there any question in anyone's mind that i was speaking to you?
yes , you .
i'm just a performer .
shakespeare .
stuff like that .
shakespeare?
he was a writer .
yes , i know .
i know who shakespeare was .
cry 'havoc ! '. . . . . . and let slip . . . . . . the dogs of war .
me?
that is the question .
we few . . . . . . we happy few . . . . . . we band of brothers !
now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer . . . . . . by this sun of york .
you're pretty good .
you're also a fighter .
i can see it in your eyes .
you are a dangerous man .
don't you agree?
no disrespect , sir , but you'd be better off letting me go .
a fighter is about the last thing that i am .
don't you think i should be the judge of that , soldier?
get up .
i said , get up !
you're right .
you're not a fighter .
but you will be .
i'm giving you a chance at a life . . . . . . that means something .
a life worth living .
i'm glad to see you .
we missed you .
i missed you .
kurt , how are you?
hungry .
gretl , what happened to your finger?
it got caught .
caught in what?
friedrich 's teeth .
thanks .
did i win?
i tried to tell him .
say it again .
say what?
words you said in town .
about the wind blowing and the rest .
say it again .
blow , wind .
come , wrack .
at least we'll die with the harness off our back .
what's it mean?
live free or . . . . . . die .
i think .
you're going to watch a movie or you can sleep !
but tomorrow . . . . . . you run in uniform . . . . . . full packs . . . ... 20 miles !
everybody makes it ... ... or nobody eats ... ... for the third day in a row !
everybody up .
you got meat tonight .
why don't you tell shakespeare what kind it is?
mule .
god awful animal .
sterile offspring of horse and donkey .
can you imagine that?
there's no room in the new world for a bastard like that .
any man last in line ain't hungry enough to eat .
you show up last . . . . . . you don't eat !
i'm going to die before i'm last in line again !
that's what they're hoping for .
shut up !
at least you're eating !
you serious?
good .
this is good !
you want this? !
this is what you want?
babies !
the hills are alive
with the sound of music
these were supposed to be the best years of my life .
the laws of eight , gentlemen .
that is the legacy handed down to us by nathan holn .
may he burn in hell .
these are the laws that we live by .
the 8 . . . . . . is our symbol .
each man will bear it with pride .
only then will you be part of the clan .
sit down , gentlemen .
you will obey orders without question .
i told you to sit .
there weren't enough chairs .
i didn't specify chairs .
you could've sat on the ground .
you disobeyed a direct order .
you broke . . . . . . law one .
punishment shall be swift .
mercy . . . . . . is for the weak .
terror . . .
. . . will defeat reason .
your allegiance is to the clan .
justice can be dictated .
any clansmen may challenge for leadership of the clan .
does anyone wish to challenge me?
on your feet .
there's only one penalty .
death .
please !
i'm begging you !
you will get out of this army what you put into it .
work and you'll be fed .
fight and you'll be respected .
die and you'll be remembered .
you thinking of challenging for leadership?
no , sir .
i'm a follower . . . . . . not a leader .
you got a smart mouth . . . . . . shakespeare .
you see colonel getty always following the general?
he was the last man ever to challenge .
fight lasted 6 seconds . . .
. . . but he didn't kill him .
cut off his tongue . . . . . . then he cut off his balls .
and old getty's been following him around like a dog ever since .
fall out !
the general don't see it . . . . . . but i say you've got some nigger in you .
they're yours?
a solitary man , aren't you?
binoculars to watch life from a distance and shakespeare . . . . . . to read about it , instead of living it .
no offense , but you seem to have read shakespeare . . . . . . yourself .
if he wishes to rise above mere thuggery . . . . . . a military commander must be classically educated . . . . . . philosophy and history , even a sense of the dramatic .
what do you think that i did before the war?
do you think that i was in the army?
i sold copying machines .
i was a salesman . . .
. . . with the talent to lead men , devise and execute a battle plan . . . . . . iocked away inside .
if nathan holn hadn't come along , i'd still be selling copying machines .
can you imagine . . . . . . the wasted life?
can you imagine the magnitude of that?
but war . . . . . . war gives men like me a chance .
here .
the prize is often left unclaimed .
we must have the courage to grasp it . . . . . . for fortune always favors the bold .
he always inspires me .
i have a design for the future .
a master plan .
i will need able officers to help me carry it out .
you have the intelligence .
if your heart matches . . . . . . you will go far .
we'll talk more in weeks to come .
dismissed .
captain !
we'll be moving out tomorrow .
issue those binoculars to a scout .
and the book , sir?
burn it .
quit moving !
what happened?
what happened?
what'd he say?
nothing .
did he say anything about me?
no !
i'm getting out of here .
what are you talking about?
escaping .
what? !
you ever hear of st. rose?
it's on the coast .
it's a paradise .
we can't .
we could !
between the 3 of us we could .
i can't .
i like it here .
i like being a part of something .
take a point !
some of the men shot a lion .
they crawled into the thicket .
one of you dogs earned a treat .
over there .
those men hunted a lion this morning .
must've been a goddamn zoo here before the war .
anyway , a third man went in after it .
we don't know if he's alive or dead .
i want a volunteer .
one of you is going in there after him .
i'll go .
i guess size ain't a measure of courage .
is it?
i don't think so , captain !
come out alive , you get a lion steak !
maybe you'll find your st. rose over there .
what the hell are you waiting for , christmas?
why are you stopping?
i found him .
he got him .
let's go .
hurry up !
you still got a lion to bag !
you men get back in line !
there he is !
shoot him !
in the water .
come back without him . . . . . . and you and another man will die in his place .
go !
go !
i'll get him !
go !
don't .
just let me go .
i don't want to be a part of your army .
my army?
i like the sound of that .
i got him !
i'm sorry .
how come . . . . . . you wrecked it . . . . . . for me?
it's me or you .
what?
it doesn't have to be .
we can go together .
you and me .
good boy !
good boy .
get him .
finish it !
get him .
that's it .
get him , damn it !
no harness on my back .
bleeding?
well , bleeder . . . . . . you want your st. rose?
i'll give you your st. rose .
how you doing?
you shouldn't have .
here's a piece of good news .
jerry's decided to go to school . . . . . . to get his contractor's license .

thanks for being there for me .
men in uniform .

everything's so crazy .
the strange weather , the food shortages . . . . . . that farmer nathan holn causing all that trouble .

all right . . . . . . that's it .
wait .
wait , please .
it's got to be the uniform .
this is my husband , michael .
he hasn't said no .
i haven't said anything yet .
we've been trying to have a baby for 3 years .
we cannot on account of michael .
he had the bad mumps when he was 1 2 .
so we need a body father .
we could ask a man here , but it may cause problems .
we've seen it happen .
things go okay until the woman shows , then it can be difficult .
but you'll only be around once in a while with the mail .
you're the postman .
what do you say , mister?
you'd do us a favor .
i'm going to think about it .
excuse me .
my mother would like to give you something .
he's right here , mom .
it's to my other daughter . . . . . . annie .
it doesn't say where .
we don't know where she is .

i have a feeling about you .
i know you'll do what's right .
i got to get out of here .
easy , boy .
it's right around the corner .
what is?
what you're looking for .
what i'm looking for?
crazy old coot .
i knew you'd come here .
you did?
so how do you get to be a postman , anyhow?
you have to be in the right place at the right time .
how can i do it?
i thought you wanted to drive cars .
not anymore .
that's kid's stuff .
this is real .
so where's the right place?
could be anywhere , you know .
anytime .
only another postman can make you a postman .
kind of like vampires , right?
yeah , something like that .
you have to be sworn in , so . . . .
the organization's kind of shaky right now .
it might not last .
what does?
you'd meet people who don't believe in you .
i'll set them straight .
it's a lonely job .
i've been lonely all my life .
so have i , ford .
so have l .
what the hell !
you repeat after me .
neither snow . . . . . . nor rain . . . . . . nor heat . . . . . . nor gloom of night . . .

okay , then .
okay , then .
no , i'm saying that .
you just listen .
i'm sorry .
by my authority you're now empowered to carry the mail .
congratulations .
you're a postman .
i'd die to get a letter through .
what did you say?
i said i'd die to get a letter through .
johnny !
why don't you run along .
i need to speak to this man .
i'll see you around .
sure thing , ford .
johnny is impressed with you .
whole town is impressed with you .
i take it you're not .
you're smarter than you look .
what can i do for you?
you can either clear out or i can throw you out .
either way suits me .
you don't understand .
i'm a government employee authorized by
you are not authorized by shit !
you were trying to sneak out of here .
you are nothing . . . . . . but a drifter who found a bag of mail .
i want you out of town .
all right .
this is going in my report .
these people don't need dreams , mr. postman .
they need something real .
they need help with the holnists .
are you going to bring them that?
didn't think so .
all you cost us so far is a few bowls of soup and maybe a few broken hearts .
i aim to keep it that way .
you can stay here till morning . . . . . . then i don't ever want to see you again .
benning .
portland .
boston "?
what the hell these people
just leave it .
i said , leave it .
st. rose "?
hello , abby .
you'll be leaving tomorrow?
i guess .
everybody's up late writing letters for you to take .
they're so excited .
and how about you?
do you have a letter?
i don't have anybody to write to .
i'll find you a pen pal .
someone with similar interests .
you know?
like dancing and . . .
. . . checking for mumps .
you're funny .
hardly anybody's funny around here .
have you decided yet?
been thinking about it .
sure .
i mean . . .
. . . why not?
god , you're so . . . .
you're so . . . . . . beautiful .
i'm sorry , you probably want to keep things more clinical .
you don't even know my name .
i don't want to .
it would be easier for me . . . . . . if you closed your eyes .
we took a vote , mr. postman .
we want you to have this .
so you can't say no .
i'll take it .
you got a bedroll , some oats and a week's rations .
good .
thank you .
where will you go from here?
go?
west . . .
. . . then i'll work my way . . . . . . back here , sort of a figure eight .
times seem hard right now .
but you got to believe things are getting better .
birds are migrating again .
the rains are back .
stuff's . . . .
stuff's getting better .
o beautiful
for spacious skies
for amber waves of grain
shit !
you've got a hell of a nerve , whoever you are .
did you see abby around this morning?
this is as far as i go .
you're on your own .
god shed his grace on thee
and crown thy good
with brotherhood
are you really who you say you are?
if i come back with some mail . . . . . . you'll know .
goddamn it !
what are you looking at?
everything .
they don't usually look at me .
who is responsible . . . . . . for that?
i said . . . . . .
who's responsible . . . . . . for that? !
holnists , johnny .
you got to stay
you got to stay out of sight .
i'm a postman !
and i'm not running from anybody !
stay out of this , or i will lock you up myself .
you'll be responsible .
now set that flag on fire .
throw it through the window of your post office .
do it , michael .
it's all right , michael .
throw it .
the united states . . . . . . doesn't exist !
that flag is an abomination !
there was the strangest little goat and it was behind a fence and it . . . .
i looked at it and it had a color to it .
good .
everything .
i was amazed .
it was . . . .
good lord !
that , gentlemen . . .
. . . is a first rate piece of ass .
tell the sheriff to introduce me .
she doesn't belong in this mudhole .
excuse me .
you again !
that's my wife , general .
she's a married woman .
really?
do you know what system of government we have here?
we have what is known as a feudal system , like in the middle ages .
that's lords and vassals .
that's you and me .
now those lords . . . . . . they had some ideas .
they believed that if a vassal got married . . . . . . it was the lord's right . . . . . . his right . . . . . . to sleep with the bride on the wedding night .
me and abby have been married 3 years .
i'm sorry , but i wasn't invited to the wedding .
you've already done me one favor , son .
don't let this be a black mark on an otherwise perfect record .
we'll be civilized about this .
i want you to give me your blessing .
sir , i can't .
you can't?
you can't .
can't .
we had a great nation once .
know what made it great?
i can .
till the weak came along .
the " i can'ts " destroyed us !
i'm going to make us strong again .
i'm going to be the father . . . . . . of a new nation .
and do you know why . . . . . . it will be me?
because i can .
stop it !
you're killing him !
let me go !
please , let me go !
help him , somebody !
please !
you didn't have to !
didn't have to what?
you bastard !
you killed him !
your people seem seditious .
you seem seditious .
what am i seeing here?
i'm waiting !
a man came through with mail .
said he was a postman .
said that the government had been restored back east .
what government?
the united states government !
who said that?
which way did he go?
do not make me ask again .
east .
send a patrol east !
send 3 more . . . . . . north , south and west !
they'd better find him east .
take that damn shirt off , johnny !
i managed to save these .
do you want to die too?
i'm headed south with the mail .
don't be a fool .
what should i be?
rachel clark .
charlie sykes .
graham drewitt .
g. d. died of flu last winter .
that's all there is .
that's all there is , folks .
for now .
but there'll be more , lots more , once there's a real system in place .
right?
what about new york city?
did they survive the plague?
survive?
they got broadway up and running again .
there's a kid doing andrew floyd webber , you wouldn't believe .
how much is it to mail a letter?
mail . . . .
they won't open the gates .
they say they got a representative of the restored united states in there .
they say this army is illegal .
and they say  drop dead !
and go to hell !
that's what they say .
what are you doing? !
open the gates .
idiots !
what're you thinking? !
the romans . . . . . . had an expression . . . . . . they used to scare their children .
hannibal ... ... ad portas !
hannibal . . . . . . is at the gates .
do you know who hannibal was?
of course not .
a pretty girl like you wouldn't understand something like that .
let's fight them !
with what?
we've got 5 guns , maybe 20 rounds of ammo .
how we going to fight with that?
you don't .
negotiate a settlement .
give them extra supplies .
you're the government rep .
tell them .
right here .
make it quick .
i've got an attack to coordinate .
they've asked me to negotiate a peace treaty .
do i know you?
i don't think so , sir .
you're the postman .
aren't you?
inside !
u. s. mail .
the restored united states of america .
do these people really believe that shit? !
who are you , really?
i'm a united states postman . . . . . . authorized by order 41 7 of the restored congress .
i was at the battle of georgetown .
i watched the white house burn down .
do not try to sell me . . . . . . on any restored united states !
the new capital is based in minneapolis . . . . . . inside the hubert humphrey metrodome .
you know where the vikings used to play?
you're funny .
what are the terms?
they'll open the gates , give double the usual . . . . . . just . . . . . . don't hurt anybody .
this was all a misunderstanding .
i appreciate your offer , mr. postman .
but the fact is that you're in no position to negotiate .
these people made it through the bugs and the riots . . . . . . and the 3 year winters , but they're not going to survive you .
fire at will !
justice can be . . . . . . dictated !
kill him , and kill the restored united states with him .
in accordance with law 8 . . . . . . and by the authority of emergency order 46 . . . . . . you are hereby
get her !
go on , get him !
we can't stop now .
what are you . . .?
oh , god !
come on down .
don't move .
if you had a bullet , you'd use it .
come on .
i don't think i ever had water soup before .
maybe next time we could try it with a little sand .
dirt .
maybe a twig garnish .
you used to think i was funny .
they killed michael .
i'm sorry .
how sorry are you?
what?
what's that supposed to mean?
what's with you?
you have the mark of 8 on you .
mark doesn't mean
you're a liar .
you were with bethlehem .
does that make you one of them?
don't make me use this .
wind's come up .
it's getting colder too .
must be another storm .
anything else?
i didn't mean for you to . . . .
your legs are going to rot off if you don't try to walk .
i'm hurt .
you're lazy !
lazy?
i got a hole in my stomach . . . . . . and i'm weak .
the 2 big meals around here are snow and grass . . . . . . and we're running out of grass .
what're you doing?
give me a break !
i'm going to check the pass .
why are you in such a hurry?
i could think of worse places .
or i could think of worse company .
perfect !
help !
help !
please !
quick !
god , help me !
i told you that's all there was .
that's why you should have it .
i knew you could walk .
you're weird .
know that?
we walked on the moon once , abby .
so?
what good is that now?
obviously you've forgotten . . . . . . tang and . . . . . . microwave ovens and . . . .
your face looks pretty .
i mean . . . . . . not so bruised .
look . . . . . . there's something you'd better know .
you're going to find out soon enough .
i'm pregnant .
it's michael's baby .
you're just the body father .
how do you know it's mine . . .
. . . not bethlehem's?
he tried with me almost every night .
he couldn't do it . . .
. . . so he beat me .
said it was my fault .
i'm sorry , abby .
what is it?
what's wrong?
is it the baby?
the pass is clear .
what happened?
good , you got our stuff out .
of course .
what?
i don't understand .
i set the fire .
did you think we'd stay here forever?
no .
i'd appreciate it if you'd walk with me to find someplace safe for the baby . . . . . . then we can split up .
you shaved .
looks nice .
you're really weird !
you know that?
you ever heard of st. rose , abby?
i've heard people talk .
i've heard lots of names . . . . . . bliss , hesperia , and new eden .
sheriff briscoe says it's a fantasy .
he's wrong .
st. rose is out there . . . . . . and i'm going to find it .
but you're the postman .
i'm nobody , abby .
this is what i hate .
strangers .
do you say hi , or do you blow their heads off?
do they want to share what they got or take what you have?
if they want to take , how far are you willing to go to stop them?
all right , that's far enough .
we don't want any trouble .
me neither , mister .
what are you?
carrier 1 8 . . . . . . u. s. postal service .
got any mail?
that's impossible .
ain't you heard of the postman?
no .
tell us .
he's only the greatest man who ever lived .
he crossed the wasteland . . . . . . shook his fist at the enemy . . . . . . and spit in the eye of general bethlehem himself .
he's back east with president starkey right now .
who told you all this?
postmaster ford lincoln mercury .
he's in direct contact with the restored congress .
direct contact? !
i don't believe this !
carrier camp !
carrier camp !
gather around , everybody !
come on , gather around .
got another letter here .
it came in last night .
what's all this?
the postman sent ford another letter .
he's going to read it .
hello , all postal carriers .
i'm here in minneapolis with president starkey . . . . . . but my thoughts are with you .
remember . . . . . . nothing worth doing can be done overnight .
keep your chins up and do your best not to get shot .
signed . . . . . . the postman " !
his letters are always kind of short .
hold on !
there's a p. s.
does anybody know what p. s. stands for?
holy shit !
that would be h. s. , eddie .
no , i saw him once when i lived in pineview .
it's the postman .
guess you want to talk about this .
i found him !
minneapolis "?
p. s. ford knows what to do "?
what is this?
what is all this?
what the hell
i lied !
i told people you were in direct contact with me .
why?
because i didn't want it to end .
look . . . . . . i don't know how long i can stay .
i mean . . . . . . president starkey . . . . . . he's going to send word for me one day and then i'll have to move on .
do you understand?
but you'll stay until he sends word , right?
don't do that .
hands down .
you're staying till president starkey sends word , right?
yes !
until he sends word .
right .
could you say a few words just so they know it's really you?
it's me .
coming down .
we bring all the mail here first .
we sort it .
we group it .
then it goes out .
so far , we got 30 routes .
you spelled " tyranny " wrong .
boy !
he's smart .
from the swift completion . . .
. . . of their appointed rounds .
congratulations .
you are now u. s. postal carriers .
how old are you?
i'm 68 , sir .
can i ask you a question?
can you ride?
no .
can't walk too good either .
so why are you here?
i know stuff .
where did you get that?
1 970 .
a girl with eyes as big as saucers . . . . . . did me in a little town called saigon .
ford wants me to have his place .
said it's the best .
i'm on the other side .
i got plenty of room here .
so much for the uniform theory .
he was captured on the oregon border .
who the hell are you?
carrier 1 2 .
united states postal service .
i want the camp struck at dawn .
we'll be moving north !
you spelled " tyranny " wrong .
i wish they'd stop saluting .
just stay safe .
remember . . . . . . the mailman's more important than the mail .
boy , he's smart .
when i was a kid we used to turn our hat around backwards .
thought it was cool .
jesus christ !
damn !
i missed him .
what's the name of this town?
we never named it .
i officially declare . . . . . . postal station number 1 0 . . .
. . . in elvis , oregon . . . . . . open for business .
from now on you got to get your mail down there , okay?
this one doesn't work .
read it again .
are you sure?
yes .
what a miracle to hear from you .
stuff is getting better .
stuff is getting better every day .
i don't know who you are . . .
. . . but i do know i was wrong about you .
got a letter for you too , sheriff .
it's from my sister .
thought she was dead .
you thought wrong .
would you like to dance?
well , they say that you can never
never go back home
and if you're bound to wander
you're bound to be alone
you say i got no right
to feel what i feel
when i look into your eyes
want to dance?
but that i dream of you
most every night
comes as no surprise
well , i've been out on this road for so long
far and wide
do i roam
but something in your smile tells me
i'm almost home
i was lost in the dark
all alone
till the light
in your eyes showed me
i was almost
home is where the heart is
and my heart goes with you
i would travel till the end of time
if that's what i have to do
just to spend one night
till your sweet love light
come down
shining down on me
hello .
who do you talk to?
not a soul in 7 years of trying . . . . . . but i will .
want some?
no , thanks .
don't let the kids see that .
you go ahead , take a look .
i was an aerospace engineer .
i helped design the galileo space station .
no shit?
no shit .
i dream it's orbiting the earth forever . . . . . . with a dozen human skeletons . . . . . . all grinning at each other . . . . . . iaughing at us down here .
what is it?
it's tony .
he's overdue .
that makes 5 .
all on southern routes .
just children .
you bring me children .
i want a man .
we got births and . . . . . . deaths .
got weather .
mostly gossip .
there's nothing here .
nothing?
everything . . . . . . is here .
am i the only one who sees that? !
what?
a military man , especially a commander . . . . . . should keep a journal .
after he's gone , it's the only real defense . . . . . . against the slander that later arises .
tell me about the other stuff you know .
shit !
get rid of the bodies .
i don't want these people blamed for what we did .
neither snow , nor rain , nor gloom of night ... ... through bandit's hell , through firefight ... ... through flood and plague we cannot fail ... ... no holnist trash will stop the mail .
you are now u. s. postal carriers .
they changed the oath .
ford's idea .
figures .
they don't think to ask who they're replacing . . . . . . or why .
sir?
it'd be an honor if i could shake your hand .
do i know you?
i don't think so .
good luck , then .
nice kid .
he'll probably be dead in a week .
now that is not your fault .
you're exhausted .
you need rest .
there's food
where are you going?
route 22 .
you're grounded .
get off the horse .
you know the rule .
what rule?
22 , it's too far south .
get off the horse .
but they're waiting on
get off the goddamn horse !
i'll tie him off to this one .
you can't keep doing this !
doing what?
riding all the routes .
you're not saving anybody .
did i ever tell you how i got to be a postman?
i don't know if you'd laugh or cry .
what is it?
watch out !
we got fire !
move !
" postage due . " elvis patrol .
you want a war?
you want a war? !
i'll give you . . . . . . a war !
i was . . . . . . born for it !
you murderers !
you think you can ride? !
then today's your lucky day !
bethlehem says ... ... he's headed north .
he's going to kill 10 people in every town ... ... then burn it to the ground for what you did .
he said that pineview's on his way .
he'd wait there for you , but not for long .
i was so scared , sir .
i thought they were going to kill me too .
see?
we're too late .
i told you .
what're you going to do?
i'm going to stop this .
you can't .
get out of the way , ford .
all of you !
they'll kill you !
hold him !
stop it !
you're hurting him !
i'm not !
yes , you are !
i'm not !
i'm not hurting him .
this is all my doing .
i went against your orders .
you told me to bury the dead holnists , but i sent them bethlehem .
why?
bethlehem has to know we won't stop !
goddamn it , ford !
those people are dying because of us !
they're dying because of what we did .
they're not !
they're dying because of bethlehem . . . . . . because this is a shitty world !
lf we're going to change it . . . . . . then someone might have to die .
if i could make it be me down there , i would , but i can't !
no !
please !
you , out here !
hold her !
please !
he's out there somewhere .
watching .
i can feel it .
you feel it too , don't you?
it didn't have to end like this , sheriff !
he knew where i'd be if he wanted to face me like a man !
instead he's hiding . . . . . . iike a rabbit !
so much for your postman !
lieutenant !
ready !
we don't even know their names .
we know their names .
i think that's my dad .
aim !
ride , postman !
ride !
you hear me? !
i said , " ride !
fire !
my god , what have i done?
what ford did was wrong !
but it doesn't change anything . . . . . . for any of us , does it?
is this everybody?
the rest are on the overdue list .
then this is everybody .
got a letter from the president .
greetings , all carriers .
greetings , president starkey !
i've been in contact with the postman .
and i've received all the reports .
i'm proud of you all .
in dark days , in a weary world . . . . . . you gave everything and asked for nothing .
you beat back despair and replaced it with hope .
for that , your country can never repay you .
but the price is too high . . .
. . . and i won't see any more of my bravest die .
it is my duty to hereby disband . . . . . . the postal service of the restored united states .
you are to burn your uniforms . . . . . . and the postman is to return to minneapolis at once .
thank you .
and god bless you all .
the president .
the president never wrote that letter .
if he could've , that's what he would have said .
who's the other letter to?
bethlehem .
i'm taking it to him in the morning .
what's it say?
mail's private , you know that .
what does it say?
it says it's over .
it says we quit .
it says you quit !
what about the oath?
tell me something , ford .
how much mail can a dead postman deliver?
it's over .
then i'll take it .
i can't trust you .
if this is the end . . .
. . . if this is the last piece of mail that ever gets delivered . . .
. . . i'll take it .
whoever delivers this letter , ford , probably dies for it .
i'm still a postman !
you owe it to me .
i owe it to me .
it's not ford's fault .
he's not like you .
he doesn 't have your memories .
none of them do .
this is all they have .
it's the only decent thing they know .
what?
being a postman?
it's all bullshit , abby .
all of it .
i took the uniform off a skeleton to stay warm .
i made up the rest to stay fed .
there is no . . . . . . restored united states .
i figured it was something like that .
i'm going to st. rose .
i'm taking you with me .
i've already packed your horse .
i know you don't want to hear it . . . . . . but that's my child inside you .
i want to see it born somewhere safe .
i thought i recognized you .
general bethlehem said you should be on your knees when i do this .
i don't give a damn what that asshole said .
the general is a great man !
the general is a fucking lunatic .
you want to see a man?
that's a man .
you ready?
yes .
you're a better man than bethlehem .
i've seen it .
to bethlehem .
this letter is my testimony ... ... to the fact that there is no ... . . . and there is no postal service .
he expects me to believe this?
it's true .
i was there .
he disbanded the carriers . . .
. . . and rode west .
traitor !
then i've won .
bring the one we found yesterday .
they can die together .
you traitor !
you're a traitor !
that one's the second in command .
why doesn't that surprise me?
i was thinking , sir . . .
. . . he might be more valuable to us as a prisoner .
you were supposed to kill him . . . . . . weren't you?
i couldn't get close enough .
who are you?
my name's clark .
postal carrier for the restored republic of california .
who are you?
postmaster ford lincoln mercury .
it's an honor .
wait !
wait a minute .
hold your fire .
you two don't know each other?
this'll never be over .
it'll go on .
except i'll be fighting a goddamn ghost .
should we fire , sir?
no , goddamn it !
i won't fight a ghost .
tabula ... ... rasa ... . . . gentlemen .
a clean slate .
i want all mail carriers hunted down .
i want the postman found .
i want him dealt with .
colonel , organize the scouts .
you said he rode west?
and this is his second in command?
yes , sir !
i'll keep you to bargain with .
the postman is weak that way .
set your rifle on the ground !
set it on the ground .
what?
this old thing?
it isn't even loaded .
where are we?
you're in bridge city . . .
. . . where we don't allow guns .
the sentry said you were coming .
i know you .
you're . . . . . . famous .
i was once . . . . . . sort of . . . . . . kind of .
not anymore .
looking to cross?
we will be .
right now we'd appreciate some food .
okay .
there are some kids behind us .
how many?
3 .
3 .
okay .
come on in , guys !
i know you're out there .
wait .
just wait .
what did he want?
hold on .
he says . . . . . . he's looking for the postman .
there's no such thing anymore .
the man on the horse says there is .
he thinks he's here .
and he's coming back with friends .
what's a postman?
you never heard of a postman?
are you the postman?
yeah .
i heard of you , man .
you're famous .
yeah , i guess i am .
and all of a sudden , i'm not . . . . . . wearing the right clothes .
man , you're going to love this !
open that second chute , bro !
you have a gift , postman .
i saw it back in pineview .
you've given us all back what we'd forgotten .
you made mrs. march feel like she could see again .
you made ford feel like he was part of the world .
you give out hope like it was . . . . . . candy in your pocket .
remember this?
i remember .
i always like to think that you left it on purpose .
this is hard for me .
michael was the best man i ever knew .
i never thought there'd be another man i could love the way i loved him .
i couldn't see it for so long .
and now you're leaving .
and i'm afraid .
i'm afraid you'll never find your st. rose .
it's not important .
i'm afraid you'll never see your baby .
i need full power , man !
this dude's got a long way to go !
this thing's working perfect , man !
a lot higher than it looks , huh?
you nearly went .
get in .
there's 3 good sized towns up ahead . . . . . . with enough people to help you if you can convince them to come .
don't tell anybody . . . . . . i like to ride this damn thing just for the hell of it .
being a city official has its perks , you know?
trust me , man .
this'll get you there a lot faster .
how do i stop?
quit worrying about the little things .
good luck , and godspeed .
reporting for duty , sir !
know what to do?
talk to the people .
tell them it's important .
tell them we can make a difference .
once more unto the breach , dear friends , once more ... ... or close the wall with our dead !
in peace , nothing so becomes a man as modesty and humility .
but when the blast of war blows in our ears ... ... then imitate the action of the tiger .
summon up the blood .
disguise fair nature with rage ... ... and lend the eye a terrible aspect .
who are they?
i don't know .
looks like mostly women and young people to me .
how many?
it's an army .
at last . . . . . . someone with courage enough to bring the fight to me .
reckoning , gentlemen !
they're an eager looking bunch !
morale is a dangerous thing .
bring up the prisoner !
we'll show them how this game is played .
stay here .
is he surrendering?
god , i hope not .
my little shipping clerk .
mr. copy machine salesman .
we're both a couple of frauds .
so be it .
but great men are made by other great men .
patton had rommel .
grant had lee .
but i get you .
you're no general .
you're not even a good painter .
trying to goad me into a fight?
it'd be great if wars were fought just by the assholes who started them .
we could settle this right here . . .
. . . you and me .
unfortunately , it doesn't work that way .
but it does in your army .
i invoke law seven . . . . . . of the laws of eight !
any man may challenge for leadership of the clan " !
i challenge you .
you're not a holnist .
you're not a member .
you don't have the right .
i have every right !
i invoke law seven .
where . . .?
i challenge . . . . . . for leadership of the clan !
where do i know you from?
cry havoc . . . . . . and let slip the dogs of war
you remember that?
shakespeare .
the one who didn't want to fight .
i should have found a way to kill you then , but you seemed so strong .
law seven . . .
. . . it is !
this war is settled here !
i studied people .
i know your problem .
do you know . . . . . . why you can't fight?
because you have nothing to fight for .
you don't care about anything .
you don't value anything .
you don't believe in anything !
and that's what makes me better .
i believe . . . . . . in the united states .
it doesn't have to be this way .
we don't have to kill each other .
mercy . . . . . . is for the weak .
ford , don't !
there's only one penalty . . . . . . and that penalty is death .
he isn't worth it .
i'm the head of the clan now !
there are going to be new laws !
no more killing .
there's going to be peace !
how about it , ford lincoln mercury?
be a leader , ford .
live . . . . . . and let live .
your daddy wrote to tell you . . . . . . he'll be here as soon as he can . . . . . . and that he loves you very much .
mail's slow .
i'm going to have to see about that .
your daughter .
her name is hope .
my father saw how fragile we are ... . . . and how quickly we fell into the hands of tyranny .
he saw that ordinary men . . . . . . could reach deep within themselves and find courage .
he saw that if we began to communicate as a nation . . . . . . we could become strong again . . . . . . united .
but he never did see st. rose .
he said . . . . . . there was too much to be done .
he'd made a promise .
and in keeping it , he traded one dream for another .
with no regrets .
and so , in honor of my father . . . .
that was me .
subtitled by gelula & co . , inc .
the united states doesn't exist !
i'm giving you a chance at a life that means something .
redemption is within your grasp .
you are required to show yourself .
but i'm not with these people .
i'm just passing through .
i can see it in your eyes .
you are a dangerous man .
kill him !
you just head back the way you came .
we don't give charity .
i'm a representative of the united states government authorized . . . . . . by the restored congress to reestablish communication route .
what's that mean in english?
it means i'm your postman .
you are nothing but a drifter who found a bag of mail .
i have a feeling about you .
i know you'll do what's right .
who's responsible . . . . . . for that?
a man came through with mail .
said he was a postman .
said that the government had been restored back east .
what government?
the united states government !
how about you?
do you have a letter?
i don't have anybody to write to .
i took the uniform off a skeleton to stay warm .
there is no restored united states .
you gave them back their memories .
you've given us what we've forgotten .
you have a gift , postman .
you give out hope like it's . . . . . . candy in your pocket .
i want all mail carriers hunted down .
you've got to stay out of sight !
i'm a postman !
i want the postman found .
i want him dealt with .
how much mail can a dead postman deliver?
we're not going to stop !
somebody might have to die !
you can't keep doing this .
you're not saving anybody .
did i ever tell you how i got to be a postman?
i don't know if you'd laugh or cry .
do you hear me , postman? !
i said , " ride !
you want a war? !
i'll give you . . . . . . a war !
there used to be a postman . . . . . . for every street in america .
they wore uniforms and hats . . . . . . just like this one .
getting a letter . . . . . . made you feel like you were part of something bigger than yourself .
i don't think we ever really understood . . .
. . . what they meant to us until they were gone .
