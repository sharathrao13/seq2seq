'cause if you want to play this game ... after i've been reasonable , i will show you .
that's nykwana wombosi speaking in paris the day before yesterday .
he was an irritation before he took power ... he was a problem when he was in power and he's been a disaster for us in exile .
he's writing a book about the agency's history in africa .
he's going to name names .
it's basically a shakedown .
he's demanding the agency's help .
he wants us to put him back in power in six months or else .
this interview , and i'll make the tape available to anyone who wants it ... he goes on to claim that he's just survived an assassination attempt .
he says it's us .
he says he's got proof .
the director wants to know if there's any possible shred of truth in this accusation .
i've already assured him there's nobody that reckless on my senior staff .
i was recalling a conversation we had some time ago , talking about treadstone .
i seem to remember nykwana wombosi's name might have come up .
i'm not sure what we're talking about .
someone tried to take him out .
tried and failed .
was this treadstone?
you're asking me a direct question?
yes .
i thought you were never gonna do that .
what happened?
well , we , uh , lost communication with our man .
this was almost two weeks ago .
we've been working around the clock , the whole unit .
we've been sleeping down there .
believe me , we're doing everything we can .
and you don't let me know this?
you never wanted to before .
you never made a mistake before .
uh , yes .
i'm here about a numbered account .
if you just enter your account number here , i'll direct you to an appropriate officer .

so i went and i took all the money i had ... and i went in with friends and we took over this really cool surf shop outside biarritz ... um , which was right by the water ; it was amazing .
it was just amazing for about three months ... until it turned out that this , uh , jerk who had found us the lease ... was actually shining everyone on and ... [ sighs ]
and what?
what do you mean what?
listen to me .
i've been speed talking for about 60 kilometers now .
i talk when i'm nervous .
i mean , i talk like this when i'm nervous .

i haven't talked to anybody in a while .
yeah , but we're not talking .
i'm talking .
you've said , like , ten words since we left zurich .
well , listening to you , um , it's relaxing .
i haven't slept in a while and ... and i've had this headache .
it's like a constant thing inside my head .

and there's a stepbrother .
it's tough .
the girl's a gypsy .
she pops up on the grid here and there , but it's chaotic at best .
she paid some electric bills in spain , '95 ... had a phone in her name for three months in belgium , '96 .
no taxes , no credit .
i don't like her .
i want to go deep .

who has a safety deposit box full of ... money and six passports and a gun?
who has a bank account number in their hip?
i come in here ... and the first thing i'm doing is i'm catching the sight lines and looking for an exit .
i see the exit sign too .
i'm not worried .
i mean , you were shot .
people do all kinds of weird and amazing stuff when they're scared .
i can tell you the license plate numbers of all six cars outside .
i can tell that our waitress is left handed ... and the guy sitting up at the counter weighs 215 pounds and knows how to handle himself .
i know the best place to look for a gun is the cab of the gray truck outside .
and at this altitude , i can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking .
now why would i know that?
how can i know that and not know who i am?
hey .
