por que estas aqui?
no , not te me ...
porque estas aqui?
no , no , no , que estas haciendo .
dowd !
no !
no !
no !
mommy , mommy !
please , help me .
please , help me .
please !
it's okay .
help ... !
mr. dowd was pronounced dead on arrival , detroit sinai .
perforated cranial pan , projectile fragmentation ... frontal lobe .
now , the woman , jeanine mueller , she subsequently lost the child .
uterine damage , hemorrhaging on admittance .
the infant died due to blood loss suffered by the mother .
hospital records indicate acute fetal trauma , gunshot wound .
this material was covered some months ago .
why is it being brought up again?
have you had contact with ms. mueller?
i have spoken to her , yes .
on what occasion did you speak with ms. mueller , and what prompted the conversation?
i'm not going to answer that .
that's a personal ...
do you think , in retrospect , acting perhaps less aggressively , this might have been prevented?
what might have been prevented?
the infant's death .
that's very dangerous , you know that?
hungry?
yeah , but not for this ... toe cheese .
shh !
i'll bite it off .
he's going to wake up .
if the smell didn't wake him up already , he's out .
my feet smell?
yeah .
yeah .
hi .
so .
so , what?
so , how'd it go?
it went .
yeah?
what can i say?
what did you say?
what do you think?
ma'am , let me just , uh ...
sorry , your name , again?
liz detmer .
right , right , ms. detmer .
my , uh , duty assignment was solely undercover narcotic work .
do you have any idea what that entails?
i have a general idea , yes .
okay .
well , then , generally speaking , ms. detmer , you don't know what the fuck you're talking about .
they expect you to come in with this , " glad to be here " bullshit , head hung low , hat in hand .
yeah , that's ridiculous .
well , they're not going to forget .
it's all what they say .
then i don't understand why , you know , you went and talked to them .
'cause they asked .
mr. tellis , that's not necessary .
if you haven't seen what i've seen , or done what i've done , you don't know where i'm coming from .
i am not an officer of the law , mr. tellis , and , therefore , i have no formal training .
but i would expect someone that did would perhaps behave judiciously , exercising discretion and restraint in necessary quantities ...
jesus christ , lady .
look , we can do this all goddamn day .
you want to assess all this blame?
i'm going to call you on it .
so what is this?
i mean , i can make it very simple for you .
you want to talk?
i'll talk .
i have no problem with that .
but if this becomes some half ass ambush , and you're putting me under the lamp ,
i will walk .
now .
are you familiar with the michael calvess case?
uh ...
yes .
he was murdered .
yes , i'm aware of that .
this investigation , as you may or may not know , has stretched over 60 days , and failed to produce any tangible evidence or yield a single suspect .
it has not , however , deterred or diminished our efforts to apprehend and punish those responsible .
throughout your undercover stint , you maintained prolonged contact with the city's drug element .
would that be an accurate statement?
i had some relationships .
is it fair to say , given your rather abrupt discharge from the ranks 18 months ago , that your cover and those contacts might remain intact?
we feel that your presence in this investigation would be invaluable , and would warrant complete reinstatement , homicide division , detective grade .
when the suspects are caught and charged , and a verdict rendered , you would be eligible for the assignment of your choosing , commensurate to sentencing .
no .
i'm sorry?
i'm not interested .
bear in mind , mr. tellis , if i may be so bold , that career opportunities in law enforcement ...
what a fucking waste of time that was .
tellis !
captain mitchell cheevers .
thanks for coming down , man .
oh , sure .
come on , listen , i want to apologize for in there , okay?
they get paid to put people on the spot .
they made their money today .
all right , come on , hey , hold on .
you're going to make me fucking chase you?
come on , give me ten seconds .
go ahead .
calvess was a cop .
yeah .
okay , he didn't deserve this .
nobody does .
fine , good , then help me out .
what?
come on , help me catch these motherfuckers .
man , just come down here .
just just look at the files , would you?
help me out .
i think that's ten .
time's up .
for who?
what the fuck else are you going to do?
they offering you something?
they asked me to look at some files .
shit .
i swear to god .
yeah , files .
why?
'cause they got a dead cop and dead ends and they're reaching .
this welfare pension bullshit is not going to cut it .
i know that .
you just do something else , then .
what?
i do something else?
yeah .
okay .
what would that be?
hey , sergeant , has , uh ,
michael calvess 'personal effects cleared yet?
yeah .
lieutenant oak , per departmental mandate is restricted from participating in the calvess investigation any further .
that's the log line , and ... that's the way it's been worded to me .
why is that?
well ... he and calvess were close .
he'd been on collateral narcotic investigations for over a year .
he was the first one in the tunnel that day .
he discovered the body .
i like him .
i do .
he's got a 93 % conviction rate .
he's swingin 'a big stick .
he makes solid collars that make solid cases .
but ... between you and me , he's not stable .
you don't even know what the fuck you're planning on , man .
come on .
yeah .
you're an idiot .
you don't even know .
you ought to know ...
he's all of that shit a cop just cannot be , not right now .
not in this city .
not in this department .
we're talking about a marked name .
henry , what the fuck , man? !
i swear to fucking god , if i get another call you're beating on your wife and kids , you're fucking dead !
get off me !
get the fuck off me !
get off !
shit !
what the fuck !
go get this piece of shit out of here !
i mean , listen , captain , we can both sit here and say , or we can assume that he's just adhering to this department ban on his involvement .
you're a smart guy .
you know that's bullshit .
well , i would hope so .
yes , but again ... it's only a matter of time before iad brings down an indictment on him .
listen , do yourself a favor , concerning oak , um ...
i would just blow out all this bullshit , go to convicts and ethics inquiries , and hinge this whole thing on his involvement .
would that be up to and including your own involvement?
i don't understand .
nick , if i go to bat for him ,
i'm going to have to do it contingent on you being his partner for the duration .
the duration of what?
the duration of the investigation .
hey , you asked me to read some files , and i did .
you know , the tale of the tape is ... and this is nothing you don't already know ... is that your best shot at breaking this is bringing him back on , and just go off the work he's already done .
i don't want to waste any more time .
do you want on this case roster ... yes or no?
i am not looking for active assignment .
i don't ...
i i want a paycheck ... okay?
i mean , this three quarters is not cutting the shit .
i don't need , i don't want ...
i don't want to be out with some guy playing nine ball on some perp's skull .
i'll tell you that .
i want a desk .
i need a desk .
fine .
get me a conviction , i'll get you a desk .
like that?
just like that .
why don't we get some coffee?
you must be somebody's something special .
no , not really .
no , not really?
getting them to reassign me to a case that i'd been so resoundedly removed from?
you got to admit , that takes some people to pull .
it's not what i did .
it's what you did .
the work you put in .
they know they're better off with you than without you .
i'm just going to say this , all right?
i don't know you , so i refuse to fuck around with you any more than i have to .
did internal affairs set you up with this?
no .
no?
fringe ex cop fallen out of favor ,
iooking to get back behind a badge?
they got files three feet thick on guys like you .
they bunted you on a reflex .
probably , but i'm telling you the truth .
you weren't approached or asked in any way to keep tabs on me for ia?
no , i was not .
hey , i don't blame you for asking .
you don't do what i did and just waltz back in .
now what does that tell you?
that tells me that this investigation is running on fucking fumes .
don't get confused thinking that this is about calvess .
i know it's not .
this is all politics .
this is political appointments , it's referendums , it's squashing a race riot .
you think those assholes upstairs give a shit and a shake about michael calvess?
they didn't know him , they don't care about him , and they can't forget about him fast enough .
the only thing you need to know about me is that i'm going to bag the motherfuckers that killed mike .
if that means breaking every point of procedure , then they're broke .
it's because his life was worth a little bit more than a wreath and a rifle salute .
you understand?
no , it's just me .
and what about you?
what about me?
well , why you coming back to this shit?
cops die daily , and they die bad .
what makes mike the exception?
i don't know .
you don't know?
just something to do?
something .
i know what time it is , but you can still give me a kiss .
audrey , i don't want to get into this with you right now .
i just want to go to sleep .
i just want to lay down next to you , and go right to sleep .
you want to kick my ass all over in the morning , that's ... that's fine , but ...
i just want to ...
i'm fucking beat , man .

this guy's pretending to be a cop , man !
he denies it , he grabs the aerosol can and then some matches and lights her head up .
that's her screaming .
so he mentions this jimmy fredricks , and cheevers told us to route this through you .
and what's he saying?
guy claims he's the snitch for him .
says he'll trade what he has to say for some type of sentence reduction .
oh , we can't do that .
we're not going to do that .

i seen him over on bell isle a few months back .
he beefing with my boy , leo lee .
you know leo lee?
yeah , you know him and shit?
yeah .
leonard leflore .
he's just a punk narc .
we used to run raids on his ass every other day .
so what were they arguing about?
some shit , man .
lee pinched on a buy .
that dude , calvess , he got a bad temper , yo .
he beat up on ...
listen to me , nobody gives a shit what you think you saw .

yo , i'm telling you , man , i saw him spit on him .
i saw him walk away , told him , " nigga " this , " nigga " that .

crotch rot , pussy stank !
fuck you !
puta sucia de la vagallado !
i i i love you , baby !
fuck !
i love you !
fuck you !
that's a good woman .
what do you know about this leflore ,
'cause his name doesn't do anything for me .
there's no mention of him in any of mike's duty summaries .
there's no f. i. card on him .
he's just a nickle bagger i ran across maybe half a dozen times .
he's got two whole hobbies ... ganja and guns .
other than that , he's a fucking bore .
but i guarantee he's got outstanding warrants .
you want to run him?
lay down on the floor , this is the police !
go .
oh .
nick !
you doing good?
oh , yeah .
sorry i didn't make ...
i couldn't get to gabe's birthday party .
it's just ...
i just had a lot of stuff to do .
don't worry about it , we didn't miss you .
thanks for the present , anyway .
yeah , well ...
nick tellis , this is a really good friend of mine , art harlan .
how you doing?
he works with the coroner's office .
so i hear your name on the call , and this one i have to see .
what'd you do , drown him?
no , this might have to do with mike .
calvess?
yeah .
what the hell you doing with that?
i thought they were closing it out?
no , not yet .
okay , thanks , guys .
it's good .
rub a dub dub .
wow .
he's been here for a while .
how long you think?
i'm guessing he's sitting in this ... two , three weeks .
that long?
oh , yeah .
he's ripe .
okay , subject has distended bloat , upper , lower torso .
clotting and ... hematoma discoloration .
hello .
what is it?
a tooth .
oh , my god .
back molar .
blasted it right out of his head .
well , most of his mandible was shattered , along with the rest of the dental palette , so iding him outright's going to be a little tricky .
sorry .
what do you got there?
looks like a mossberg , sg 6 shot .
i don't know how the fuck he got this .
what?
why?
it's tactical issue , metro pd .
swat team uses it .
it looks like the serial number's been filed down .
let me see that .
definitely looks like our man opted out with it .
no question about that .
oh , damn !
i don't know about that .
well , not on purpose .
why?
what do you mean?
there's no firing pin mark on the casing .
boy never even pulled the trigger .
hmm .
so what do you think happened?
i'm stretching here , but ... knowing old leo ,
i think maybe he was high out of his fucking mind , reaches for the bong , goes down , breaks ...
his lazy ass is not getting out of this warm water , so ... he sees the gauge , maybe , and takes a little green bud , decides to pop it in the breach , fires it up , starts toking away , forgets there's a shell in the pipe , flame hits the firing cap .
that's beautiful .
bubble bath , earful of tunes , smoking some hub , and this is how the evening ends !
art .
that's fucking fantastic .
that still doesn't explain the mossberg .
i don't know how he got that .
well ... if it is tact ordinance , it could be an underground buy .
i mean , their armory's been broken into a few times .
yeah , it could be .
or he could've known a cop .
or somebody who knew a cop .
what do you want to do about this?
nothing .
just let art finish up .
recovery sweep through , if they find something good , if they get a stolen weapons hit , great .
what we came here to do is corroborate ruiz 'story , which we obviously can't do .
that's all right .
i think it was all bullshit anyway .
hey , art , i'll talk to you later .
okeydoke .
i hear bubbles .
i hear bubbles .
uh oh .
what are you guys doing up?
we had a deal , i thought , you and me , there?
so you want to talk about this now , or you want to wait or what?
i i don't know .
what are we going to talk about?
oh , my god , what could we have to talk about?
you know what?
i can't believe that you're out there again .
and don't say that you're not or give me any of that crap .
what are you talking about?
there's hours involved .
i'm sorry .
there are .
what do you want me to tell you?
why don't you tell me who uttered that fucking famous , uh ,
this job'll either burn you out or bury you "?
do you remember saying that?
yeah , it's narcotics , audrey ...
you know , i'm just curious .
how bad you think that it was , huh?
tell me what you remember ,
'cause i'll tell you what i remember .
five months pregnant , being in a detox tank with you .
what the fuck is this coming from?
not sleeping and watching you ...
what does that have to fucking do with anything , huh? ... climb the walls .
do you remember that?
i'm a little late for bath time?
well , excuse me .
i've been giving him one every day for seven months !
your acting like this is no big thing ,
like you can just jump in and then just jump out again .
it is a big thing , all right .
it's a fucking big thing !
yeah , it's two weeks work , is what it is .
you know what , that's bullshit .
that is ...
that is bullshit !
that's all you want me to think that it is .
you know , the other day i asked you why you wanted to do this , and you said that you didn't know .
well , you know what?
i got news for you .
you need to know , and you need to let me know ,
'cause for the life of me ,
i'm looking at you hold your son and i can't understand , do you understand?
i can't understand why you would ever feel the need to go back to that again .
yeah , what if it was me who got wasted out there , audrey?
that wasn't you .
what if it was?
that wasn't ...
what if it was !
there are other people aside from you , okay?
you're a little three foot circle .
you know what , that's really unfair .
they had this kid beaten half dead .
they could've walked away .
anyone could've .
instead ... they took the gun , and they blew half his head off , okay?
i know , i'm sorry , i'm sorry , baby .
i'm sorry , i'm sorry , i'm sorry .
i'm sorry .
you were right about the mossberg .
definitely was one of ours .
lab pulled partial prints off of it .
one set belonged to leflore , the other set belonged to this gang banger , latroy steeds .
it's just that he's got a bunch of drug shit .
just did 30 days in wayne county .
got out a week ago .
do we know where he's at?
s t e e d s.
larry , you're his parole officer .
he hasn't ...?
not once?
all right .
well , let me know if he shows , okay?
no problem , you got it .
he hasn't checked in once .
here , go on .
let's sit on the house , see if he shows up .
come on , go , go , go , go , go , go , go , go , go !
let's move it out here !
how long you been married , nick?
uh ... about a year and a half .
got any kids?
yeah , one .
i got a boy ... a big baby boy .
hmm .
almost ten months .
that's nice .
how long you been with your wife?
um ...
i lost her .
we were married just shy of 16 years .
she had cancer .
i didn't know .
i'm sorry .
no ...
i thought ...
it's okay .
we were talking wives .
you have one .
i had one .
i've been asked before .
probably'd be easier on people if i took my ring off , but ...
... because we'd avoid these embarrassing little moments , but it's okay .
i like talking about her .
the first detail i had was ... was vice .
i wanted robbery/ homicide , but ...
i caught vice .
i worked vice .
i hated it .
mm hmm .
just hated it .
you know , i rode it to the seams , hoping to leapfrog out of there , but ... no good .
no dice .
and i'd come home , just in bad shape .
just pissed off .
that's when i first started getting an ulcer .
just miserable .
and i'd lie down in her lap ... and she'd rub my head .
some nights , she'd sing me to sleep .
i'd just lie there , staring at her .
still the best place i've ever been .
i became a much better cop the day she died .
and any half step , any hesitation
i had about the job was gone .
i see a dead bolted door , i break it down and be the first one in the room .
i started working joint task force .
the head crack , hang wrecking crew .
zombie squad .
it was a diversion .
it was just a way to keep from thinking about her .
i remember one night ... ... i went with the sheriffs on a warrant raid .
this dipshit was selling meth out of his apartment .
it was just a stop and pop .
broke down the door , rousted the guy .
i was in one of the back rooms looking for junk .
and i hear something .
i turn around , and see these ... these eyes staring at me from a closet .
it was a little girl .
a little ten year old girl ... naked .
shaking like a leaf .
she was scared to death .
her stepfather was pimping her out for rent .
wrapped her in my coat ... carried her out to the squad car .
i went back .
and i beat that motherfucker half to death .
i thought of my wife .
i thought of the baby we never had .
all the things about her that i hung onto .
'cause a little girl being brutalized , a little girl being abused has got nothing to do with the rules and regulations , and everything to do with right and wrong .
it's the same thing with calvess .
why is he the cookie monster?
he loves cookies .
'cause , like , every time in the morning
i want cookies for dessert ... gone , no cookies left .
no?
none .
'cause he eats them all .
yep .
he eats cookies for breakfast .
he eats cookies for dinner .
he eats cookies for lunch .
he eats cookies for ... anything .
this one won't let me out of her sight .
she drags her dad's t shirt around with her wherever she goes .
can you say hi to the man?
shy .
she's a little doll , though .
honey , you can go .
i want to thank you , kathryn , for letting me come by .
oh , it was not a problem .
thank you for bringing his things .
i wasn't too thrilled about going through them , but i'm glad you brought them .
i haven't seen some of these pictures for a long time .
you have to forgive me , because i'm pretty convinced that any way i go about this is the wrong way , so ...
no , please .
i don't mind answering questions .
did you know mike?
no , i didn't .
i never got the chance to meet him .
i wish i had .
i know his reputation , though .
hmm .
but what i need to ... know more of , i i think ...
you know , what i'm lacking ... is ...
well , i worked undercover narcotics for two and a half years myself , so i know that life can be very difficult .
i know that it can be ... very problematic , especially with a ... with a family .
you know , maybe i ...
maybe not .
baby , can you go check on your sister for mommy?
go check on your sister .
what are you asking me now?
well , um ...
i know it's personal ... ... but did things at work adversely affect things here?
here at home?
no .
did he tell you what it was that he was doing?
yes .
did that seem to bother him?
did it bother you?
yes , it did .
well , there you have it .
you notice anything about his mood in the weeks before?
was there anything strange about his behavior?
no .
did he mention any names?
maybe there were some people that he was dealing with that ... came out?
no .
i remember the day that mike was killed .
i was putting the girls to bed , and i heard a knock .
and when i opened the door ...
henry was standing there with tears in his eyes .
and i knew right away that he was gone .
and i remember running back to the girls 'room , and sitting on the edge of their bed and just ... ... staring at them .
i needed to see his face .
mom , somebody's at the door .
where?
where?
hi !
hi .
come here , you .
how are you?
give me a kiss .
where's my kiss?
there's someone here .
he's been asking me questions about mike .
what?
i need to talk to you outside right now .
i'll be right back , okay?
okay .
what the fuck you doing talking to her without me being here? !
i brought her husband's things over .
yeah , and you questioned her .
what for?
what for? !
is this " mother , may i?
we said we were going to do some of this on our own , right?
some of this doesn't extend to her , and don't get fucking cute with me !
take your hand out of my face .
if you need to know what she said about anything case related , you refer to the file !
yeah , i looked at the files .
they're thin .
what you don't fucking do is talk to her without notifying me in advance !
that's not the way we do things !
why is that?
what's the problem with me speaking to her?
because the problem is every fucking question you asked her , she's already answered !
she's been badgered and bothered by cops and cop questions for two fucking months now , and the biggest fucking problem is her husband is fucking dead !
you understand? !
i understand that .
great .
don't let it happen again .
it's the meanest crowd ever tonight .
it's like the roman coliseum in here .
no to babies .
are you insane?
it's burnback .
it's like a table scrap junk that they stew in a freebase and then shoot .
it killed this guy dandridge i told you about .
well , i think they were trying to sell the same shit to calvess .
yeah?
tellis?
mason in records .
hey , what's going on?
hey , i got the stuff .
looked for matches , looked for hits ...
no , no , i just want hits .
how many hits?
okay , i got four , and they're a little bit vague .
you want the names?
you got something to write with?
yep , go .

i don't know how good it is , but that's the last address we got .
unit 2 , " that's good enough .
all right , man , thanks .
all right , appreciate it .
they ran the comps through , and about ten months ago , an overdose was brought into the e. r. , and this guy sheps ...

j. reed .
i know your daddy nicknamed you deacon after deacon jones ,
'cause he had a little thing with him .
fuck , man ...
you know how i know that , don't you?
how , man?
'cause i was and i still am a cop .
a fucking cop?
you're trying to tell me you a fucking cop?

'cause you way too little to bust , acorn .
yo , fuck that shit , man .

i used to smoke blunts with you , mr. cop , man .
i don't give a shit what you think , asshole .
it doesn't matter to me in the least , but i'm about to tell you what does matter , and you're about to fucking listen
like your life depended on it .
fuck .
what the fuck , man?
a month ago , an undercover officer was murdered ... pedestrian tunnel off houston and west grand .
they beat him up , they put a gun to his fucking head , and put a bullet through it .
i don't want to hear any shit about what you don't know or what you didn't do , because we both know you ain't got the nut sack for something that size , so , i'm fucking positive you didn't kill him .
his name was michael calvess .
take a gander , there , buddy .
hold on a minute , man .
y'all motherfuckers come up in my fucking crib , and shit , want to throw fucking hot sauce and blind my fucking ass , and now you want me to help you?
street name jimmy fredricks .
fucking crazy?
i know you know .
oh , my bad .
you know you know .
my bad .
i know this motherfucker .
i think i might've let him suck on my dick once or twice .
come here , come here .
you want to be bounced back to county , keep it up !
i'll have you wearing half shirts and halter tops , braiding some nigger's hair !
piece of shit !
oh , fuck , man , i think i'm bleeding , man .
you going to act like a punk , you're going to get played like one .
now , listen very , very carefully .
they found smack at the murder scene .
a mean fucking mix .
now , you took some of this exact same stuff about ten months ago , and it nearly killed your dumb ass .
you don't have the chemistry or the sense god gave goats , which means you didn't do the cook .
now , dowd is dead , so , who sold to you?
whatever , man .
you going to tell us?
no?
you think you're a real fucking smartass , you know that?
we're tossing every inch of this place .
every inch !
i didn't do it , man .
i don't know , man .
where is it?
where is it? !
oh , my god , this must be one of those new refrigerator safes !
what a laugh , you dumb fuck !
what's all this , huh?
what's all this? !
oh , bagels and guns .
what do you know?
you're going to prison .
you're deep lock now .
now , tell us who sold you .
deep lock found , deep lock found .
come on , man , fuck all this shit , man !
unbelievably so fucking dumb !
are you kidding me?
this is the last time i'm going to ask you !
who sold you? !
get off me , man !
who sold you?
darnell , man !
it was fucking darnell , man !
he's got a cop id .
he's got a shield .
you all right?
let me see .
where you hit , the neck?
let me call it in .
i'll call the paramedics .
hang in there .
i'll be right back .
what i have done is i've given him a rather large and strong dosage for the wound itself , but other than that , i've used a mild sedative for him .
what i am actually worried about is his prior history of drug abuse , and i'd like to know more about that series of ...
you know , i ... ... the problems that he had before .
i have to go and pick up my son .
we have a ... we have a son so ... but i'm i'm going to be back .
he didn't do it .
i don't know if you're not listening or you don't want to listen , but he didn't do it !
well , we've compiled enough evidence to support the contrary .
wha ...?
and what does that mean?
what evidence?
what?
that means we're closing it out .
captain ... there's absolutely no way that sheps killed calvess .
and if you're closing because of that , you're way off .
neither one of us believe that he did it .
he didn't have the balls to do this !
he didn't have the capabilities !
he didn't have the cold blood !
this guy did not do it .
and yet he had no compunction when faced with possible arrest about trying to kill both of you .
this is someone of questionable mental stability with a pronounced history of drug use .
that you can pin motive on .
that could ride the rap after the fact ,
'cause this is what you're going to do in lieu of .
you know , you all are jazzed up because this piece of shit that we killed , sheps , was white .
so the whole racial card gets cooled , and you can forget about the dead cop .
that's what this is all fuckin 'about .
all right , all right ,
henry , ease off , all right?
wha ...?
ease off .
we have a known criminal with over 40 felony and misdemeanor offenses with a drug tie linking him directly to calvess in possession of stolen weapons , narcotics and identification belonging to another slain officer .
richard dekolvie was stabbed to death three years ago ...
and homicide got a confession and a conviction out of that , so that bullshit's irrelevant .
what you fuckin 'bringing that into it for?
it still denotes illicit criminal acts .
oh , this is unfuckin 'believable .
sheps came into possession of the id as either a result of participation in the murder or through association with the murderers .
this guy was 105 pounds soaking wet .
if that .
these injuries that calvess sustained , they only could have come from two men with considerably more size and strength .
that's not even taking into account ,
jesus christ , there's no murder weapon .
what are you fuckin 'talking about here?
this matter is no longer mine , gentlemen .
i apologize .
are you serious?
are you serious?
it's the commissioner of police .
that is so fucked up .
yes , it is fucked up .
this is so fucked up .
we're done .
you're so wrong , pal .
fuckin 'bullshit !
i'm sorry , man .
i want you to stop now .
this is done .
it's not .
no , it has to be .
you know i wasn't happy and that was fine , but this is where i hit the wall
'cause i've seen you like this before .
and before i was willing to put myself through it , but i can't do it anymore .
i'm gonna get 'em
i'm gonna get the guys who did it .
they fucking ... didn't do it
'cause we ...
i , i lost 'em .
i lost 'em .
you know , you're running at this for all the wrong reasons .
what , you think catching them is going to make you less like them?
purified?
just like calvess?
you know what , that's bullshit , nick ,
'cause that's not what he was .
that's not what you are .
i love you , but i don't want ...
with everything that i am , i'm still going to leave .
'cause i can't be with you like this .
i'm done trying .
i'm done trying .
tellis , you got something on your desk .
look at this .
where'd you get a warrant?
friends where friends count .
i ran that name that deacon gave us ...
darnell .
this is what came back .
darnell , beery , " big d love .
possession , trafficking .
his last arrest was pulling a gun on an officer .
look who he was booked with .
eugene " deacon " sheps ...
latroy steeds .
steeds .
steeds and berry were never questioned about mike's murder .
they all used to work at titan's auto .
it was closed down after a flood six months ago .
i want to check this place out .
... chicks in my limousines , lovin 'every minute
of my fantasy , wet dreams , girl scream ...
hey .
fuck !
steeds or berry?
freeze !
do not fuckin 'move !
do not move !
fuck !
fuck you .
get down !
fuck you !
now , fuckin 'coolio tried to blow my head off .
darnell , let me see you .
let me fuckin 'see you .
fuck off , bitch !
come on !
we've got some shit to fuckin 'talk about .
i don't see no badges !
i don't see no warrants !
i didn't do this shit , man !
let him go , man .
put him down on the ground !
let him go , man .
you shut the fuck up .
shut the fuck up .
i'm detective lieutenant henry oak of the detroit metropolitan police department .
this is detective sergeant tellis .
we already know who you are which is why we are here .
you've been hiding from us 'cause you killed a cop .
that cop's name was michael calvess ...
jimmy fredricks .
now i'm going to give you the opportunity to come all the way clean on this and confess .
if you choose in your limited wisdom to fuck around with me and force my hand , then you're both going out of here in a bag .

you know what you're doin 'is illegal .
bullshit .
just book us , man .

you confronted him , you overpowered him , and you beat him .

latroy hit him in his face once , then i kicked him again to keep him down .
and then we ran .
and then oaks started shooting .

he come there and see his partner all strung out there .
that motherfucker just flipped out .
you guys think that this is my first fucking walk in the park? !

i'll bet you all the prints that come up off of there
belongs to your man oak .
that's right .
he planted it , man .
he put it there .
you got ten fucking seconds , front to back , for the record now .
go .
goddamn it !
open the door !
hey , god ...
tellis !
what the fuck was going on in there?
why'd you just fucking lock me out?
huh?
i just asked you a question !
what'd you lock me out for? !
were you tailing calvess the day he was killed?
what? !
you heard me !
did he compromise his cover?
and were you tailing him as a result of that?
you talked to them after i left?
the mossberg off leflore .
dekolvie's id and badge .
you heard them !
they're claiming calvess supplied them with stolen police issued to make junk buys .
can you explain that?
'cause i am having a hell of lot of trouble figuring that out !
exactly how long after i left did you let those liberal stirrings in you spill out all over the fucking floor? !
the position i'm in ...
i don't like where you're putting me , and ask these questions .
now , were you following him?
it's not an indictment if you did , but if you did ,
i need to know , and i need to know that now .
no .
i was not tailing him .
but you were there before he died .
you were there before he died .
tell me that i'm wrong .
you wanna fucking talk?
all right , we'll talk .
mike was making a bust that morning .
he had enough going against him to make an arrest .
he needed backup .
off roster .
why?
because he wanted to bring 'em in on his own .
so i stayed back .
i waited , and the buy went bad .
then how come you couldn't identify those guys in there right away?
because they shot him and ran !
they shot him , but ... you shot them as they fled the scene .
what?
what did they say to you?
when that motherfucker oak starting shooting , he shot calvess , killed calvess .
he killed him , he killed calvess so that somebody could take the fall for his ...
you must be out of your fucking mind !
as much as he meant to me , you call on my integrity? !
my commitment to that kid? !
you're going to let these fucking lowlife pieces of shit smear that? !
huh? !
it's gotten past us .
we're bringing 'em in .
we're taking 'em in .
you're fucking with something you can't possibly understand .
i'm taking 'em in .
it's over now .
you fucking joke .
you know that?
you're a fucking joke !
your whole career is a fucking joke !
a complete fucking washout !
you popped that needle freak in the park and in the process , you hit that fucking woman with a stray bullet , costing her a bouncing baby !
enough !
fucking her up for life !
enough !
stop !
shut the fuck up !
come on .
you're a lie .
come on .
fucking lie .

this is a good friend of mine , art harlan ...
he signed her out of all of those clinics .

shit ... you made sure that harlan was the acting m. e. on the calvess case , didn't you?
didn't you?
tellis might have a connection to mike .
calvess?
