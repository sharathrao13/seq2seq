how i miss scotland ... and the sea the sea .
there's nothing like it in all the earth the salt in your face , the wind atyour back ... and all the world before you .
andyou're freer than a bird in the air or a fish in the ocean .
to be free
i reckon that's why i joined the second war to end all wars .
i was at the university studying to be a teacher when the call to arms occurred .
i was only too eager to put aside my studies for the glory of action .
i stopped reading history and became a part ofit .
i joined the proud ranks of the argyil & sutherland highlanders ... and became captain ernest gordon .
my commanding offiicer was lieutenant colonel stuart mclean , the finest commander the 93rd battalion ever had ; a man ofdeep loyalties to his country , his duty and his men ; a loyalty that was soon to be matched by his own second in command ,
major ian campbell , a man ofpassionate devotion to the colonel as well as the cause .
and it was our loyalties that would eventually be tested .
the argyils had a legacy or being the last line ofdefense , and we were to prove that legacy once again ... in the face ofdefeat ... and capture by the enemy .
sir !
sir !
you all right , sir?
you look the devil in the face with pride , boys !
and try not shit your kilts .
bastards are just playing with our minds .
when you surrender in war , you're stripped ofyour dignity as a soldier .
all you've got left is your fellow comrades , many ofwhom you've just met .
lieutenant jim reardon , merchant marine , one ofthe few americans in the area .
attached himselfto the argyils during the allied surrender .
we called him " yanker , " 'cause he was both an american ...
and a bit ofa wanker .
parade , halt .
what's that stench? .
that'll be death , major .
sir !!
parade , right wheel .
parade , halt .
left turn .
standat ease .
stand easy .
what the hell does " tenko " mean? .
must be roll call .
today , you will count off in english .
but tomorrow and forever , in japanese .
start counting !
one !
two !
three !!
four !!
five .
six .
big eared nip .
bastard .
this is a shame culture .
you make 'em lose face , you'll pay .
stand easy .
this is an outrage !!
i am a senior officer , and i will not tolerate this barbaric behavior !
this man has rights !
dirty
attention , prisoners .
you are now captives ... of his imperial majesty , the emperor .
behold the extreme penalty for those who try to escape .
this is foryour own sake .
you will sign these papers promising not to escape .
no escape , myyankee ass .
this is against the geneva convention .
they don't give two shits about the geneva convention .
tomorrow , you will bring these signedpapers from all prisoners .
you are dismissed .
go .
go !
what did you just say? .
i told him you were stupid .
don't know whether to thankyou or kickyour ass .
ian campbell .
dusty miller .
where'd you learn to speakjapanese? .
what with the colonel? .
you wantyour colonel back? .
owe the man my life .
the more hair , the more lice .
ow !
a word of advice stay close toyour cobbers .
but when it comes right down to it , it's survival ofthe fittest .
every man for himself .
barter is the name ofthe game , gents .
they call the hospital the death house .
you don't want to end up in here .
relish your health now , gentlemen .
it's the lastyou'll see ofit .
there are thousands more prisoners in camps all along the river .
not too much skinny here from the outside .
japs keep us in the dark .
no radios .
they catch one , they'll kill you .
officers , try to keep your shirt on .
it'll distinguish you from the grunts , which is about the only thing ... that's keeping us from degenerating into a bloody anarchy .
oh , shit .
ernie , whereya goin '? .
to find out about the colonel .
you're just askin 'for trouble !
doc .
get him down here .
come on .
easy .
easy .
it's my back .
my back , my back .
eh .
what the bloody hell happened? .
looks like you didn't bow .
what? .
always bow before a guard , korean orjap .
never look 'em in the eyes when they pass you .
that's pure defiance .
always look away .
rules of bushido .
bushido? .
their kind of chivalry .
respect and obligation .
ifyou don't respect them , they feel obligated to bash you .
nothing personal .
well , it sure as bloodywell feels personal .
yeah , well , it works both ways .
they do the same to their own .
that's a comfort .
now listen .
you must understand , these monsters truly believe we're an inferior race less than human .
now , beating a prisoner to them is like beating a disobedient dog , and the fiercer the beating , the fiercer their dedication to the emperor .
you'll be all right , son .
make space for the colonel .
you're buggers forpunishment, you lot .
you should've let 'em take me instead , sir .
anything we can do foryou , colonel? .
ah .
start preparing .
preparing forwhat? .
escape .
heh !
what else , you towheaded yank? .
dusty .
thankyou .
colonel , i've been watching these nips .
there's never more than a handful ofthem ... guarding the perimeter at any given time , and they're not watching very closely .
itjust doesn't make sense to me unless  unless what? .
unless every prisoner's been caught or died in a thousand miles ofhostile jungle .
unless the local villagers are willing to turn in a p. o. w. for a bowl ofrice .
unless escape is impossible .
excellent .
yanker .
you find the best escape route , hmm? .
ian .
yes , sir .
you should start getting survival gear together , hmm? .
ernest , get things together .
we can trade with the locals .
yes , sir .
and as soon as i'm well , we're on ourway .
yes , sir .
yes , sir .
okay?
good .
sir .
good boys .
they're good boys .
that's myboys .
hey .
how about some extra for my colonel? .
he's in the death house .
ifyour colonel can't make it , it means he can't work .
ifhe can't work , he can't eat .
nip rules .
move along .
come on , pal .
i'll oweyou one .
hey , you heard him .
he said , move along !
you look like a sheep humping highlander !
come on !
yeah !
do it !
what areyou , bloodychicken?
i'll kickyourass !
come on , you english fuck !
well , come on , then , wanker !
well , come on !
it's enough .
what does it take for a man to lose his dignity?
come on , you english fuck !
how far can he fall to pay the price ofsurvival?
dusty built a sanctuaryjust outside the camp called the church without walls .
we were allowed to visit it freely .
they knew we had nowhere to go .
i'll tellyou what i'm gonna do soon as i get back to glasgow .
gonna visit my favorite pub .
i'm gonna sink ... 1 4 whiskeys and seven pints .
and i 'm gonna spend the night in the arms of my tender , lovin 'wee wife .
you're married , sir? .
no , but ifyou got a sister , i'm available .
what aboutyou , ernie? .
probably teach .
i've always fancied teaching .
i thought i'd see the world first though .
you got that wish .
aye .
when i get outta here , i'm gonna go into business for myself and get stinkin 'rich .
what kind ofbusiness? .
black market .
prostitution .
i'll tell ya what , mate .
you're not gonna make much money as a prostitute , i'll tell you that .
what aboutyou , sir?
what areyou gonna do after the war? .
start preparing for the next war .
in the bushido code , the nation is everything .
the individual is nothing .
conformity is how they gain their sense ofpurpose , and they expected us to fall in line as well .
what are we sayi ng , dusty? .
loyalty , politeness , frugality .
soldier's duty .
well , isn't that just dandy .
carry on , sergeant major .
parade !
parade tion !
about face .
all show respect for honorable lieutenant colonel nagatomo ,
chief ofthailand p. o. w. administration .
i think she fancies me .
it is great pleasure for me ... to see you at this place .
you are few remaining skeleton ... of ourvictory and our pitiful victim .
youshould weep with gratitude ... at his imperial majesty , the emperor , who pityyou for being coward !
what's he talking about , cowards? .
rules of bushido .
they believe the losers should kill themselves .
you will give me greatpleasure ... to build a railroad ... through the jungle to the glory of his imperial majesty , the emperor , saviour ofjapan !
saviour of asia !
we willbuild this railroad ... ifwe have to build it over the white man's body .
it is your purification .
hmm .
railroad to be 420 kilometer , from chungkai base camp to ...
thanbyuzayat in north .
you will build the railroad in 18 months .
eighteen months? .
how will my men manage that on the rations you're feeding them , hmm?
officers work as well .
royal engineer will oversee building .
where are the signed papers?
gentlemen , as you have violated the geneva convention , the hague convention ... and every human right for properly supervised prisoners of war , mayl respectfullyrecommend ... thatyou ... and your fascist monkeys ... stickyourhead upyourass !
because we will not sign your bloody paper !
now translate that !
i am sick of this drivel !
gentlemen .
sir .
look after my boys , ian .
it is regrettable , but ... we take each ofyou andshoot one by one !
come on , man .
sir !
until you respect emperor !
come on .
out of here .
out of here !
fuck !
fuck him !
come on !
come on , man !
come on !
fuck !
come on , man !
out ofhere !
bastard !
fucking bastard !
out , out ofhere !
fucking  come .
major , what happened? .
what happened?
fucking shot !
where's the  fucking fucking shot !
it's the colonel's blood .
it's the colonel's blood !
fuckingshot him !
the bastard !
major .
major , the colonel !
you fucking slanted eyed
don't let him go !
campbell !
don't be another !
enough is enough !
fucking bastard !
there's nothing you can do .
there's nothing you can do .
how can he die?
what are we gonna do?
it's all right .
what the fuck are we gonna do now?
shh !
what the fuck are we gonna do now?
just stay down , major .
verily , verily , i say unto you , " except a corn ofwheat fall into the ground and die , " it abideth alone . " but if it die , it bringeth forth much fruit .
there is suffering before glory .
there is a cross ... before the crown .
outward , turn !
slow , march !
cheers .
i'm not leaving .
what?
i said , i'm not leaving .
what about our plan?
i owed the colonel my life .
and i watched him die in front of my eyes , and i just stood there doing nothing .
you thinkyou're the only one suffering here? .
you thinkyou're the only one  now waken up !
there's a reason why every escape has failed , and there's a reason why thejaps don't give a toss about security .
we were fools to think we even stood a chance .
i've got my own plans now .
you are a selfish bastard .
come on , ernie .
ernie !
fine !
yanker , wait a minute !
yanker , wait !
you'll never make it on your own in that jungle .
it's suicide !
take a look around you !
take a look in the eyes ofthese men .
you tell me whatyou see .
that's right , ernie .
they're dead already .
you know it , and i know it .
everybody in there does , too , except they're afraid to admit the obvious , and that scares the fuckin 'hell out of me !
because at least with escape ... it gave us one thing hope .
hope , ernie .
because without that , we might as well be sitting in there ... with our thumbs up our asses waitin 'for the end to come !
is that whatyou want? .
let me tell you something about me .
i am not a stupid man , and i am not a kamikaze .
ifl can't escape , i'll do the next best thing .
i will take care of myself .
and that's exactly what i plan on doing .
yanker !
we are all in this , all of us together !
sure , kid .
every single one of us .
the japanese were preparing to invade india .
the railway would be their supply line .
we would be the means to their end .
when you're living to die , every minute is an eternity .
days are lost .
months blend into one another .
and the only realityyou know is in the moment , and the moment hangs over you like death .
it's diffiicult to describe what it's like to live with permanent hunger in your belly , and the stench ofdisease and death all aroundyou with every breath you take .
malaria , diphtheria , pellagra , dysentery ... sucks every ounce offluid right out ofyour body .
your muscles cramp up andyour circulation collapses .
major !
he's burni ng up .
ernie .
i don't know anybody who could survive that lot .
oh , ernie , son .
you are a good soldier ... and a good friend .
so this is death .
dark .
cold .
all alone .
no more reason to fight , so they give up on you .
in death there is no secondchance .
so that's what you think about when you're dying the real value of all that you've done with your life , andall thatyou might have done ... if only you'd had a second chance .
aah !
bloody hell !
these nip bastards are eatin 'like the prince of wales !
life doesn't wait forthe individual , especiallylife as a prisoner ofwar .
ifyou want to survive , you need a bit ofluck , a quick wit and a mate to pickyou up when you fall .
where am i?
you've been unconscious for days .
i thought if i could get you out of the death house and into some fresh air , you'd have a better chance of surviving .
well , i don't know if i want to survive anymore .
open up .
how did you get the food away from the line? .
i have my connections .
come on .
open up .
why areyou doing this? .
hey , ernie .
uh , me and the cobbers , we've been chewing it over , and , uh , we got thinking .
what's the purpose in what we been suffering? .
i mean , where's thejustice in in nips bashing us and working us to death? .
and what's worse , we're killing each other to save our own skins .
what exactly are you asking me? .
you said you wanted to be a teacher .
yeah .
we thought thatyou might have some answers , sir .
would you like me to ... take a lecture on the meaning oflife? .
oh , that's a bloody fine idea , sir !
please , just leave me alone .
that's what i figured .
you know , a man can experience an incredible amount of pain and suffering ifhe has hope .
when he loses his hope , that's when he dies .
all right .
uuh .
shit , i gotta take a shit .
come on .
reardon managed to make a connection to the local thai black market .
lemme see .
get outta here !
he wouldn't share it with the others ... for fear ofbeing discovered by the nips .
at least , that's what he told us .
good god , yanker , that's stinking !
ri ght there , major cam pbel i , this is the scent of happiness .
nectar of the gods .
our ticket to numbness .
fermented rice alcohol .
this one's on the house .
yeah?
bastard .
he's done it .
course i've done it .
oh , nice one , yanker .
let's have a swig .
whoa , whoa , gentlemen .
you want charity , go to church .
as for me , i'm bartering my way to happiness .
so pony up with some cash .
anything you got .
don't be shy .
line starts right here .
two cigarettes .
you've gotta get out of this rain .
come on .
walk !
ernie , you bastard !
you're still alive !
hey , lazarus !
back from the dead , my son .
well , i kinda wish i'd stayed there , sir .
bollocks , soldier .
we need you alive .
hey !
come on .
what's wrong?
he hasn't eaten .
he's been able to get me extra rations .
he never got you extra rations , ernie .
he was giving you his .
help me with his legs .
i learned that while dusty was taking care of me , the major was preparing his own plans .
just what ,
i couldn't tell .
no , no .
where did you get the food?
multi ple anonymous donors .
eat .
i 've decided to start school for the jocks .
a jungle university .
i already made my own blackboard .
yankerrustledme up a textbook , for no small price .
first class is this evening .
i've got six students already .
i know it's small , but , em , it's a start .
i don't want to be the skeptic here , ernie , but how in the hell doyou expect to engage in a group activity ... without the nips seeing you? .
in the one place that the nips will never go near .
this stench is intolerable .
shutyour cake hole !
we're doing the best we can .
get used to it !
right , lads .
eh , makeyourselfas comfortable as you can , andlet's getstarted , eh?
i'd like to speak toyou about plato .
um
all right .
what ...
is justice?
excuse me , sir .
sir .
is it true you're giving educational classes?
mm hmm .
we'd like to help teach .
well , what's your story? .
roger primrose , trained in the fine arts .
lieutenant foxworth here used to teach shakespeare at cambridge .
i'm his platoon sergeant .
poor blighter's at a loss without his books and the bard .
i figure ifl can keep him busy long enough , he won't end up killing himself .
i'm ... notjoking , sir .
well , unfortunately , we don't have any shakespeare .
to die , to sleep no more and by a sleep to say we end the heartache ... and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to .
'tis a consummation devoutly to be wished .
to die , to sleep to sleep , perchance to dream .
ay , there's the rub , for in that sleep of death ... what dreams maycome when we have shuffled offithis mortal coil , must give us pause .
there's the respect that makes calamity ofso long life .
for who would bear the whips and scorns oftime .
th 'oppressor's wrong , the proud man 's contumely , the pangs ofdespised love , the law's delay , the insolence of office
h m m .
looks i i ke we do have the old bard after all , sir .
looks like we do .
he'll handle it .
come on , foxworth .
th 'oppressor's wrong , the proud man's contumely , the pangs of despised love , the law's delay , the insolence of office , and the spurns ... that patient merit ofth 'unworthy takes , when he himself might his quietus make with a bare bodkin? .
that's nice , david .
who would fardels bear , to grunt and sweat underweary life ,
but that the threat ... ofsomething after death , the undiscovered country ... from whose bourn and no traveller returns , puzzles the will , and makes us rather bear those ills we have ... than fly to others that we know not of? .
i n the second book of the republic ,
plato says , " what will happen to the just man ... should he enter this world? '
well , thejust man will be scourged , racked , chained .
then after every kind of misery , he will be crucified on a pole for all to see .
any questions? .
i've got a question .
do you mind? .
sure .
ifthe just man ... is treated as you say , then what's the just response? .
roll over and let evil have its wicked way?
well , what would you recommend , major?
oh , i'd recommend defiance .
j ustice for the captors .
an eye for an eye .
at what price mercy?
yeah , mercy .
the last bastion of traitors and cowards .
so you would take a man and crucify him on a pole for all to see?
i would seekjustice .
any of you?
sergeant major?
heave !
heave !
heave !
major campbell was a natural leader amongst men .
he seemed to draw them from all nationalities and groups ,
and he had a way with uniting them in a common cause his common cause .
better get two more of ours .
the guards change between 5 : 00 and half 5 : 00 every single day ,
so we have to be there , men .
sorry , major .
are we interrupting a church service?
so what's the story?
major , let's say your plan works , right?
you've confiscated the guns , captured the guards , taken overthe whole camp .
what then?
you have still nowhere to go .
and when the nips find out , we'll have a regiment a thousand strong ... descend on us with a vengeance .
you can't possibly hope to survive .
who's talkin 'about survival?
so that's what this is , a suicide mission .
come here .
come here .
so what areyou gonna do , eh?
what areyou gonna do?
you're gonna throwyourself on the mercy of bushido?
aye , now that would be suicide .
save us the bullshit , major .
what are they payin 'ya , yanker?
huh?
oh , didn't he tell ya?
some ofhis best trades are with the japs .
well , how'd you think they get such good medicine? .
ain't that right , yanker? .
you tell them , yanker , eh?
ha !
you are endangering the life ofeveryman in this camp .
i don't think they agree with your idea of justice .
so , what , are you the voice of the people now , eh? .
oryou may be just a wee bit too jap happy foryour own good .
ernie , we argyils have got to stick together .
and you know that's what the colonel would say .
good boy .
greaterlove hath no man than this , that a man lay down his life for his friends .
you have heard that it was said , that you shall love your neighbor ... and hate your enemy .
but i say to you , love your enemy , andprayforthose who persecuteyou .
forwhat shall it profit a man ... ifhe gains the whole world , but loses his soul?
for what will a man give in exchange for his soul?
baht?
baht .
you're making a terrible mistake .
i can get you anything you want .
american chocolate , whiskey , american cig how about a watch?
the majorimagined reardon a threat .
to him , a man without a sense ofduty ,
ioyal to no one but himself ,
is already a traitor .
shit .
no , please .
please .
it's my school .
it's my school !
major campbell struck a deal with the japs .
i was to be left alone .
in his mind , this was not considered betrayal .
the school had delayed his plans .
men were changing their minds .
and dusty had been the catalyst .
this book ... teaches to turn the other cheek .
we read these books , and we become better slaves for the emperor .
he says the book is superstition .
captain noguchi says the railroad progress is too slow .
he received orders from headquarters ... requiring us to finish six months earlier than it was scheduled .
honorable sir , that's
you are dismissed .
superstition .
i'm still alive , you jap bastards !
you can understand that , can't you?
they could take away our books and classes , but we were determined they couldn 't take away what we had learned in our university .
dusty led some ofthe men out of the death house to help draw water .
his example ofwhat we were learning inspired us to work like never before .
and our captors noticed .
as for the major , we refused to get even with him to pay him back in kind .
and it began to eat at him .
captain noguchi says he gives you your books back ... foryou to keep learning .
captain noguchi graciously givesyou these gifts ... for being good workers .
what is it?
we're back in business , lads !
oi , these are three years old .
japanese import laws .
there's mail in here !
oh , let's see it .
from that dayon , yankerneverspoke much .
something had changed inside him .
it was hard to tell whether it was for the better ... or the worse .
chi p , chi p , m uckers .
graduation ceremonies are coming .
i want a tip top performance out ofyou .
continue .
gentlemen ,
let's continue .
if we are marked to die , we are enough to do our countryloss .
and ifto live , the fewer men , the greatershare ofhonor .
he that shall live and see old age , then shal i he stri p his sleeve and show his scars and say ,
these wounds i had on crispian's day .
old men forget , yet all shall be forgot .
meat !
meat !
beef !
yanker decided to join us a bit late in the term , but eager to catch up .
you're a good teacher .
what's your name?
i'm nagase .
takashi nagase .
hello , takashi .
i'm ernest .
i've actually been wonderin '... whereyou learnedsuch excellent english .
i was educated at cambridge .
to be a good translator ,
i thought one must understand the culture .
so what do you think of the british? .
i think there is a lot to learn from them .
can iaskyou , honorable takashi , what are you doing here in this camp? .
uh , i was classified low physical fitness .
prisoner ofwar camp is not honorable place forjapanese soldier .
it is more like punishment .
shame for his entire family .
well , what about ...
sergeant ito? .
surely he's the consummate soldier .
he accepted the blame for the bad decision that his superior made .
it resulted in the deaths of most ofhis squad .
right .
so that's why he's so bitter .
no .
in bushido , it is an honor to be punished in place ofyour superior .
according to our imperial rescript , in the emperor's army , a single life weighs less than a feather .
no matter how good things got , we were still slaves building a railway , being starved to death .
thousands ofus in a dozen other prison camps as well .
and as ifthat weren 't enough , the major and his dangerous plan seemed ready to explode at any moment .
it was a sobering thought when we realized ... we weren't the only slaves being used in the name ofthe emperor .
they called them " comfort women " spoils ofjapanese conquest .
a conquest whose original intent was to purify the spirit ... where the true warrior deems his sword the soul of bushido the key ofheaven and hell .
a symbol ofwhat he carries in his heart
loyalty and honor .
we finished the railroad in october of 1943 , six months ahead ofschedule .
a real cause for celebration .
like we were told in the very beginning , they built it over the white man 's body .
these damned yellow mongoloid nips .
actin'as ifthey built the bloody thing .
bloody rai lway of death .
that's the least of our concerns .
what do you mean?
we've built the railway .
don't need us anymore .
those ofyou to the right of me will be immediately transferred ... to another camp .
it seemed like the final hindrance to the major's plan .
half of his men were split apart that day .
sent away , never seen again .
attention , all prisoners ,
there is a shovel m issi ng from a toolshed .
the one who has taken the shovel , return it now .
if the shovel is not returned , the entire company will suffer punishment .
you will respect us .
the shovel was found .
there was a miscount a simple , bloody miscount .
you are dismissed .
what would compel a man , one so selfish , to sacrifice himself for others?
boys , i can't feel my legs .
i can't feel my legs .
tonight's the graduation ceremony .
japs have all been invited .
that means a slim to zero chance of anyone being left in the guardhouse .
major , you're not still planning on going through with this?
there's only six of us .
we lost six men .
i thought it was near impossible with 12 .
god in heaven knows , we haven't got a chance with six .
so now you're privy to the mind of god in heaven?
no , but  i will not tolerate double mindedness .
i'm stayin '.
well , that leaves five .
don't worry , boys .
you don't worry , boys .
we'll have our justice .
major charlie fraser , language .
sergeant bingo johnson , philosophy .
and last , but by no means least ,
private wallace hamilton , ethics .
gentlemen , the graduates ... from our jungle university .
well , let the festivities begin .
the music we heard that night was less than perfect .
in fact , it was bloody terrible .
but we didn't care .
in our hearts we heard what it could be .
we heard the true spirit ofthe music , and that was pure freedom .
if we are mark'd to die , we are enough to do our country loss .
go on .
do it .
guard .
down .
down .
come on .
come on now .
glad you could make it .
well , the music was bloody awful .
he that shall see this day and live old age ... shallstandat tiptoe when this dayis named .
then shall he strip his sleeve and show his scars , and say
there's no ammo in this thing .
find it !
old men forget , yet all shall be forgot .
shh , shh , shh .
it's a b 24 .
it's liberators .
how can you be sure?
it's unmistakable , man .
sweet music , man .
it's liberators !
alliedaircraft .
they couldn't see us , but we could sure hear them .
and we knew that the war was turning .

these men are guilty of murdering two guards ... who represent the imperialarmy ...

such bad spirit must be punished .

when dusty miller died , something in the hearts ... and minds ofevery man died with him .
what we had somehow managed to hold onto for years of survival ... now seemed utterly meaningless ,
iike god himselfwas playing a crueljoke on us all , until i remembered dusty's words so very long ago .
except a corn ofwheat to fall into the ground and die ,
it abideth alone .
but ifit die , it bringeth forth much fruit .
i never found out what dusty said to i to that day , but i knew i had witnessed the power offorgiveness .
attention .
soon , all inferior races will bow ... before the majesty of the em peror and the knights of the bushido .
when we heard the planes again , we thought our deliverance had finally arrived .
and then it happened .
hai i kni ghts of " bullshito !
our own allies thought we were the enemy .
give me a hand !
go on !
i'm fine !
help the other men !
hurry !
help me !
help me , ernie !
just don't look at it , man .

an enemy location was also hit nearby .
the wounded had abandoned their posts looking for help .
their arrival at our camp would compel us to make ... the most important decision ofour lives a decision that would defy the bushido code ... of honor and shame .
no good .
no good .
ernest?
captain gordon , i forbid you to give comfort and aid to the enemy .
major , those ... are wounded , dying human beings .
they're no harm to us .
ernie , get back to your own men .
could someone please get me some water?
couldsomeone please get me some water?
we were left alone by our captors .
nowhere to go .
nothing to do .
an uncertain future , with only a makeshift radio left behind , hoping for any word from the outside .
to all allied prisoners of war .
the japanese forces have surrendered unconditionally , and the war is over .
for he today that sheds his blood with me ... shall be my brother .
be he ne 'er so vile , this day shall gentle his condition ,
from this day to the ending ofthe world .
but we in it shall i be remembered , we few , we happy few , we band of brothers .
where are the guards?
they they left .
fled into the jungle ... from us .
which direction?
i have no idea .
you're a man of true principle and devotion .
and you know ,
i wanna be just like you just like you .
major campbell?
ernie .
you're just in time .
you're making a mistake .
no .

oh , god , forgive me .
oh , god .

what is the consequence of a single life weighing less than a feather?
bastard !
bastard !
what is the final destination of hatred?
when you look in the eyes ofthe enemy ... and you see yourself ,
come here .
at what price mercy?
who is my neighbor?
how many times shall i forgive my brother?
what does it mean to love one's enemies?
what can a man give in exchange for his soul?
these are the questions that i faced in my prison camp .
the answers ... changed my life forever .
