previously on stargate sg 1
these two liquids mixed together form the most virulent poison .
am i supposed to hold my breath?
the poison is only deadly to symbiotes .
there's enough material in that vial o kill every tok'ra on this base twice over .
anubis once probed thor's mind and in doing so they would have gained access to asgard beam technology .
did you really think that they were gonna let you tell a secret like this?
brian !
what are you talking about?
they call themselves the trust .
they've been funding various secret endeavours all aimed at controlling alien technology for their own purposes .
the symbols , doctor jackson .
we know it's the language of the ancients .
we need them translated into goa'uld .
so either you give us what we want ...
or i will kill her .
what's going on?
not much .
i hate the graveyard shift .
nothing exciting ever happens on it .
just cos it's three a . m . here , it doesn't mean that it's not daylight on other planets .
there could be a team coming in hot any ... second ... now .
yeah , that's true !
so , coffee?
yeah .
let me ask you something .
it's late at night and there's not that many people around do you ever get the urge just to dial up the gate and check out another planet , just for a few minutes?
that'd be a no .
me me me neither .
what the hell?
the gate's gone !
i can see that !
are we gonna get in trouble for this?

what about your instruments?
were you detecting any signs of gate activity?
no , sir .
did anyone approach the gate at any time?
no .
no .
so no unusual activity of any kind .
ok
sir , are we gonna be facing any kind of disciplinary action for this?
no , sergeant , i think it's safe to say there was nothing you could have done .
thank god !
i mean , there wasn't .
one minute we were getting coffee , the next minute the gate was ...
wait a minute !
wait a minute .
you were getting coffee?
um ... we ... it ...
i'm joking , i'm joking , this is a joke , i'm sorry .
ok , that's all , thank you , guys , i appreciate that .
ok .
well , i'd i'd hate to be the guy that has to explain this to the president .
sir .
i've got the video surveillance footage .
the gate disappeared at oh three oh seven .
there were two airmen in the gateroom and two technicians in the control room but none of them saw or heard anything out of the ordinary prior to the flash .
is it just me or does that look like an asgard beam?
it does ... which makes no sense .
why would they take our gate?
usually they ask nicely before they ignore us and do whatever they damn well please .
what about the prometheus?
didn't the asgard install beam technology as well as a hyperdrive?
yeah , it's in the hangar .
we're still making adjustments to the new engines .
there is another possibility .
we know that anubis possessed asgard beam technology .
we also know that ba'al took over much of his fleet .
you think ba'al stole our gate?
to be honest , right now i don't know what to think .
well , i need some answers .
that's not gonna be easy , sir .
without a gate , we have no access to offworld intel .
we have no way of knowing what's going on out there .
you'll think of something .
in the meantime , i have a phonecall to make .
is teal'c still on p4s 161?
yeah , his meeting with the rebel jaffa leaders should be over by now .
when he can't contact us he'll follow protocol and head to the alpha site .
colonel pierce .
teal'c .
what is the situation?
we've been out of contact with earth for seven hours now .
we can establish a wormhole but all we get is a " do not proceed " response to our idc .
as was the case when i attempted to return from my mission .
we've had lockdowns before , but the fact that they're not responding to any of our radio calls has me concerned .
right now we have no idea what's happening at stargate command .
i will return to p4s 161 .
the rebel jaffa will provide me with a cargo ship which i will then take to earth .
teal'c .
we're not jumping to conclusions ; this may be just a malfunction but it's also possible earth has been compromised .
indeed .
find anything?
yeah , as a matter of fact i have .
i've been going over gateroom security tapes and the sensor logs .
for two days before the gate disappeared , we were getting this anomalous reading .
we assumed it was residual feedback from a recent overhaul of the superconductors , but i don't think so .
look at this .
what was that?
i don't know , but i checked the time code and this corresponds with the exact moment that the sensors began recording the anomaly .
i think we need to talk to this guy .
doctor kevin hartkins .
he's been with the programme seven months .
clean record , nothing out of the ordinary except that he's gone missing .
he failed to report for duty this morning .
when we checked his apartment , it was cleaned out .
this is starting to sound familiar .
you think it's the trust?
well , they've been busy lately .
they had teal'c under surveillance , they blackmailed you , and they tried to kill alec colson .
obviously the operation is a lot bigger than we first thought .
now , as far as we know , the nld has been clean for over a year but there are still dozens of ex agents who are unaccounted for and they continue to receive financing from unknown sources .
if they could take the gate out from under us , they could empty the vault at fort knox .
not necessarily .
if they could take the gate any time they wanted , they would have , but that doesn't explain what hartkins was doing , or the anomalous signal .
got a theory?
the prometheus has asgard beam technology but not asgard sensors , which means that we can't pinpoint specific targets unless they've been tagged in advance .
what if whoever did this has the same problem?
you think the anomaly was a locator beacon?
yeah , which hartkins placed directly on the gate .
i mean , there's no other way they could pull this off .
so my stamp collection is safe how does that help us find the gate?
well , if they wanna keep using the beam , they'll have to keep using the beacons .
we could request nsa satellite time to see if we could detect the signal .
do it .
m'zel .
teal'c .
what has happened here?
when i arrived , they were all dead .
all?
i will show you .
we took out a couple of guards and made the area secure .
satellite intel puts the signal somewhere inside this complex .
alright .
you three are with us .
keep your men on the perimeter , no one in , no one out .
understood .
sam !
daniel , these are vx rockets .
yeah?
what's this?
methylphosphonothioic acid .
which is?
nerve gas .
ok ... putting that back !
there's enough here to kill several hundred thousand people .
what would the ex nld be doing stockpiling this stuff?
i have no idea .
colonel !
ah ... we've got a problem here !
what do we do?
it's too late .
nothing's happening .
this doesn't make sense .
the effects are almost instantaneous .
we should all be dead .
you see?
we managed to identify the liquid we found in the warehouse .
it's symbiont poison specifically the new formula we were working on in conjunction with the tok'ra .
it's more stable than the original and easier to produce , but just as deadly to the goa'uld .
and the jaffa .
exactly ... which is why we agreed not to use it except in defensive situations .
sir , the people behind this have the gate and they have rockets capable of delivering the poison in aerosol form over large areas .
i think the trust intends to launch a full scale chemical attack against the goa'uld without any regard for the millions of jaffa lives that could be lost in the process .
so , they didn't get the memo .
the guy from the warehouse isn't talking but he was carrying this .
it's an area 51 identification badge .
colonel carter , doctor jackson .
sorry to keep you waiting .
doctor brigsdale .
i believe you've been briefed on our situation?
yes , i have .
well , as a result of our investigation , we have reason to believe that your security has been compromised .
with all due respect , colonel , we're not the ones who lost the stargate .
but alien technology has gone missing from area 51 before .
yes .
however , our security measures have been significantly increased since then .
no one's allowed to bring anything in or out no computers , no cellphones , not even their street clothes , as you've seen .
all personnel are subject to a thorough search and scan every time they leave .
look , whoever took the stargate has access to asgard beam technology .
last year when osiris came to earth , she used that same technology , which she activated remotely with a wrist device .
after she was captured , that wrist device was brought here , and you worked on it .
and it's been here ever since .
well , if you don't mind , we'd like to see it .
doctor harris checked out some of the dead jaffa on p4s 161 .
you were right .
it was the tok'ra symbiont poison .
i would not have believed it had i not seen it with my own eyes .
i knew the tok'ra had lost patience with the alliance , but i never thought they'd do anything like this .
teal'c !
i have received word from our jaffa brothers .
three more goa'uld planets have been attacked .
millions are dead .
you see?
right where we left it .
sorry if i'm a little sceptical but , uh , we've been down this road before .
it's real .
like i said .
we figured if osiris 'ship was still up there , we could use the wrist device to get on board .
unfortunately it's not only keyed to the presence of naqahdah in the blood of the user but also specific goa'uld dna .
we tried to create an adapter using samples of both elements but we didn't get anywhere .
so the ship is probably still in orbit but cloaked .
in which case we have no way to find it .
the tok'ra will be made to pay for this treachery !
let's just calm down a second .
we need to figure out what's going on .
what more do you need to know? !
the jaffa are being murdered .
poisoned , like vermin !
the tok'ra have had this chemical weapon for a long time .
why would they suddenly decide to use it now?
perhaps the failure of the alliance convinced them that there is no other way .
there's something else going on .
it's not a coincidence that this happened immediately after we lost contact with earth .
it does seem unlikely .
we must speak to the tok'ra directly .
that's not so easy .
ever since they left the alpha site , we haven't had much intelligence on their movements .
we have no idea where their new base is .
we still know the location of some of their operatives .
i believe our best chance for contact is p3s 114 .
a tok'ra operative named zaren is undercover commanding one of ba'al's garrisons on that world .
i will come with you .
hold on a minute here .
you're talking about walking into goa'uld occupied territory , and there's no jaffa fifth column there to help you out .
without sympathetic warriors in zaren's ranks , how do you plan to avoid being captured?
we do not .
what? !
only by being captured will we be brought before the commander .
that's how you're gonna make contact? !
we must speak to the tok'ra .
there is no other way .
it's too risky .
you walk in there unannounced and zaren could have you sacrificed just to maintain her cover .
that is a great possibility .
you realise the second you walk through that gate , you're on your own?
understood .
so what's the big emergency?
i can't do this any more !
you've already taken the money , doctor .
little late for cold feet .
you don't understand !
they came to see me !
they asked me about the wrist device !
who?
two people from stargate command .
and you arranged a meeting with me? !
what?
you were followed .
careful with your fire we need him alive !
brooks .
go ahead .
we've got a small problem here .
take a locator beacon and go down to hoskins 'last position .
what happened?
we've got an uninvited guest .
speak .
my lord zaren , two enemy jaffa have been captured near the gate .
one of them is the shol'va teal'c .
are you certain?
i am .
lord ba'al will be most pleased , will he not?
yes , of course .
you have done well .
now bring them to me .
yes , my lord .
i'm gonna ask you again , where's colonel carter?
i don't know !
you're gonna need to start co operating .
i can't !
a decorated officer of the united states air force and a member of one of our government's most top secret organisations is missing , and you're implicated .
i don't think you're gonna just walk away from this .
they'll kill me !
we can protect you .
and we can also choose to ignore your two million dollar cayman island account .
didn't think we'd find out about that , huh?
so if i help you , i can keep the money?
we can come to an arrangement .
the prisoners , my lord .
leave us .
my lord?
i intend to question them myself .
leave us , now .
are you mad? !
what are you doing here?
we must speak with you .
speak with me?
do you not realise that by coming here you have placed all our lives in danger?
are you not in control of this garrison?
i am , and , as such , it is my responsibility to see to it that you are tortured for information until such time that ba'al arrives to witness your execution .
so what's it gonna be?
you said colonel carter was missing?
well , she's probably on the ship .
osiris 'ship .
so you did manage to get on board .
about a year ago , some men came to see me .
they knew everything about my work , the stargate , osiris .
they knew there was a possibility that a cloaked ship had been left in orbit and they wanted it badly .
i told them that the key was the wrist device but i couldn't get it out of there , at least not through the front door .
what do you mean?
one day i was in the lab working on the adapter .
next thing i know i found myself on the ship .
i had remotely activated the transport beam .
which you failed to report .
it was killing me that i wasn't able to tell anybody i'd figured it out .
i had to keep telling them it wasn't working .
anyway , after that i went back and forth half a dozen times , but at the end of the day the wrist device was always back where it belonged .
and you beamed the others up using locator beacons .
well the beam was the only thing that worked without the command codes .
and that's where you came in .
the translation .
osiris worked for anubis , and anubis had all his command codes translated into ancient .
once they had full control of the ship , thanks to you , they had no need for me .
they kept a permanent presence up there twenty four seven , worked in shifts .
i went back to area 51 and sabotaged the adapter .
the project was shelved and no one was the wiser .
can you get the wrist device to work again?
absolutely .
launch window in three minutes .
ready for upgrade .
get down to the engine room ...
check the power relays .
yes , sir .
sir .
colonel carter .
welcome aboard .
where are we?
we're in a polar orbit around the moon ...
cloaked , of course .
this is the ship osiris left behind .
we really have to thank you .
if you hadn't caught her , we never would have had this opportunity .
you know they're gonna come after you .
prometheus is undergoing a refit .
they still have sublight engines .
once they realise you're in a ship , they'll launch and even with a cloak , you're giving off an energy signature .
we're operating at minimal power .
maybe after a year of intensive scans , they might be able to find us , but this won't take that long .
you're gonna launch a chemical attack against the goa'uld .
we already have .
we're starting with ba'al's territory , since he is the most immediate threat right now .
you realise you're killing millions of innocent jaffa?
spare me , colonel .
the jaffa are a race of warriors , bred specifically to serve the goa'uld and enslave humans throughout the galaxy .
they're indoctrinated from childhood to believe that the goa'uld are their gods .
they don't have a choice .
so they're just following orders , right?
where have i heard that argument before?
what about the rebel jaffa?
they're growing in numbers every day .
we consider them acceptable losses .
it's very simple , colonel .
earth faces an imminent threat , and we have a weapon that can eliminate that threat .
we intend to use it .
we're ready .
what's the next target?
p3s 114 .
dial it .
yes , sir .
you force me to choose between abandoning my mission and allowing you to die .
i would worry more about my own life if i were you , tok'ra .
m'zel !
i feel as you do , brother , but this is not the way .
why are you here?
we know about the attacks .
what attacks?
the tok'ra have been using the symbiont poison against the goa'uld .
jaffa of three worlds have been annihilated thus far .
impossible .
we have seen it with our own eyes .
an entire jaffa army lying dead on the ground with no wounds , no signs of battle .
how do you explain this?
i cannot .
but i can assure you that the tok'ra are not responsible .
if these attacks had been planned , i would have been informed .
initiating launch sequence .
you can't do this .
it's murder .
that's where you're wrong , colonel ...
it's war .
launching in three , two , one .
what was that?
my lord .
we are under attack .
how?
a weapon was fired through the gate .
it exploded over the ...
lord zaren !
lord zaren
brothers !
we must leave immediately !
kree !
da'nok !
you are not going anywhere , shol'va .
you do not understand .
m'zel , there may still be time .
i die ... free .
indeed .
sensor grid r 14 shows no anomalies , sir .
very well .
proceed to the next grid .
yes , sir .
she's out there somewhere .
make it work .
our next target is p5r 357 .
let's do it .
i wouldn't bother .
ba'al abandoned that planet six months ago when the naqahdah mines went dry .
she's lying .
go ahead .
waste another rocket .
that's one less planet you'll be able to destroy .
she does have more up to date intelligence .
she's bluffing .
you can make this a lot less painful if you help us select optimum targets .
what are you talking about?
you know as much about the current tactical and strategic positions of the different system lords as anyone on earth .
i don't know as much as you think .
you know enough to help us get maximum effect with minimum collateral damage .
you're the one who wants to save innocent lives .
nice try .
so ...
are we going for p5r 357 or not?
go to the next one on the list .
alright .
tell me again why i should agree to this?
because it's the only way we have to get on the ship , and if they've changed the command codes , i'm the one who has the best chance to decipher the ancient symbols .
and if there are ten armed goons when you get there , you're the only that's gonna ... get ...
better ideas?
look , daniel , just because i don't have a better idea is no reason to do anything .
look , once i shut down the cloak ,
prometheus will be able to pinpoint the ship's location .
then all i have to do is disable the hyperdrive and wait for the cavalry .
they'll never see it coming !
which is one of the advantages of the totally insane idea .
yeah ...
where'd i learn that from? !
ok .
see you soon .
access denied
access denied
come on !
system error
fine .
sir , we have something .
definitely a ship .
bearings 157 by 229 , five hundred thousand kilometres .
battle stations !
plot an intercept course .
yes , sir .
general o'neill , this is prometheus .
go ahead .
looks like doctor jackson pulled it off , sir , we have 'em on our screens and we are moving in .
understood .
we've got a problem .
i just monitored a sixty percent drop in our power consumption .
the cloak !
stay with her .
get up to the bridge ...
get that cloak back online .
yes , sir .
we're in weapons range , sir .
they noticed us yet?
i don't think so .
they seem to be operating at minimal power , no evasive manoeuvres .
what about the hyperdrive?
still no signal from doctor jackson .
general o'neill , we have a problem .
the ship's cloak is down , sir , but doctor jackson has yet to confirm whether he has disabled the hyperdrive or not .
just give him a little more time .
right now , sir , they are sitting ducks .
if they spot us , they can run , and we won't be able to catch them .
we can't afford to let them get away , general .
i recommend we open fire immediately .
general , please advise .
where the hell did he come from? !
he got the wrist device .
any chance there's more of them on board?
it only lets one person up at a time .
hoskins , this is brooks .
the cloak's been disabled .
i don't know if i can get it back online .
this position is compromised .
we need to get out of here now .
yes , sir .
what about them?
we can't take them with us .
i don't mind going for a little ride .
me neither .
sorry about this , doctor jackson .
incoming !
this is teal'c of sg 1 .
please respond !
this is teal'c of sg 1 .
repeat , this is teal'c .
repeat , this is teal'c .
teal'c , this is daniel , we need your help , c'mon through !
somebody wanna untie me?
cargo hold , what's happening down there?
cargo hold , respond .
jennings , hoskins , where the hell are you?
what's happening?
she's bringing the hyperdrive on line .
get to the gate .
they're trying to run , sir .
dammit !
general o'neill , they are powering up their hyperdrive ...
we are out of options .
can you disable the ship without destroying it?
i cannot give you any guarantees .
sir , we're picking up a signal coming from inside the ship .
what is it?
locator beacon , sir .
same frequency .
lock onto the signal ...
activate transport beam .
beam activated .
ship's gone , sir .
cargo bay , report .
this is cargo bay .
we have the gate , sir , as well as teal'c , colonel carter and doctor jackson .
teal'c? !
acknowledged .
general o'neill , it looks like you were right .
we have the gate and sg 1 aboard .
they're all alive .
that's good news .
bring 'em home .
yes , sir .
the good news is , the gate is fully operational again .
we can resume offworld missions immediately .
and the bad news is , the trust now has a fully functional goa'uld al'kesh .
we've installed jamming devices around the gate to prevent any locator beams from operating in the future .
what of the tok'ra poison?
well , they left most of it behind , but they still have enough to wipe out at least half a dozen goa'uld worlds .
in retrospect , maybe you should have destroyed the ship when you had the chance .
yeah .
tough choice .
