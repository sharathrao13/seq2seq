people once believed that when someone dies ... a crow carries their soul to the land of the dead .
but sometimes , something so bad happens ... that a terrible sadness is carried with it and the soul can't rest .
then sometimes , just sometimes ... the crow can bring that soul back to put the wrong things right .
over here .
there's a piece of glass .
hey , sarge !
yeah?
shelly webster and eric draven .
wedding was tomorrow night .

nobody .

143 fires .
they're slacking off from last year .
three hours to go .
maybe they're just slow starters .

there are procedures .
you should have cleared this with me first .

a building gets torched .

he confided in me before he ran out of breath .
who's this sack of shit?
that's tin tin , one of t bird's little helpers .
i think you can rule out accidental death .
don't any of your street demons have real grown up names?
this could be a turf hit , but it doesn't look like your usual gang crap .
come on , albrecht , spare me .
you're a beat cop now , so be a beat cop .
i'm suppose to thank you for that , right?
watch your fuckin 'mouth .

you must be awfully disappointed .
i got trouble .
one of my crew got himself perished .
yeah , who might that be?
tin tin .
somebody stuck his blades in all his major organs in alphabetical order .
gentlemen , by all means , i think we ought to have ... an introspective moment of silence for poor , old tin tin .
you're working for me tomorrow night , right?
whatever you say , i can do .
good .
that's very reassuring .
i still ain't heard why gideon's burned down .
ls that a natural catastrophe or act of god or something?
call it my need to know .
let go , you creep !
nah .
you didn't even slow down , you dickhead !
he couldn't have stopped .
he was a buttface .
i could have made it .
what are you supposed to be , a clown or something?
sometimes .
it's more like surfing than skating .
i wish the rain would stop , just once .
it can't rain all the time .
eric?
don't thank me .
are we fighting the good fight?
double homicide a year ago .
no convictions .
annie ... look at that .

the cause got her killed .
she was fighting tenant eviction in that neighborhood?
shelly webster and her nice rock and roll boyfriend , eric draven .
the last time you snooped around a case is when you got put back on the beat .
i know .
torres keeps reminding me .
i bet he does .

the site of last year's biggest devil's night conflagration .
it was exactly one year ago that the building you see ... across the street from me was totally demolished by fire .
the fire that was fought by seven fire companies ... but lost the lives of two fire fighters .
ln fact , if it weren't for the constant surveillance by the local police
freeze !

hey .

i saw her .
i saw her through your eyes .
you stayed with her the whole time .
yeah , well , you got to understand something , all right?
i was hoping she'd come out of it , you know .
give me something i could work with .
yeah .
look , l
why didn't you do something about it?
you think any people in that building , even the ones who signed the petition ... would talk after what happened to you?
i kept asking questions and ... finally got busted for sticking my nose where it wasn't wanted .
this your wife?
yeah , we , uh well , not anymore , we're getting a divorce .
it's funny .
little things used to mean so much to shelly .
i used to think they were kind of trivial .
believe me , nothing is trivial .
you shouldn't smoke these .
they'll kill you .
you going to vanish into thin air again?
i thought i'd use your front door .
look , man , i'm sorry as hell for what happened to you and your girlfriend .
yeah .
yeah .
i got stabbed !
i shot the son of a bitch !
i watched the bullet hole close by itself .
and then my business gets blown up real good .
other than that , my day sucked .
yeah .
i saw him too .
he had a guitar .
he winked at me before he jumped out a fourth floor window like he had wings .
he winked at ya?
musicians .

you're directly out of your fucking mind !
you know that !
yeah .
eyes see .
it's one of the most important things i learned from my sister .

for over a decade , the night before halloween ... has had a darker and deadlier nickname in the inner city , " devil's night " ... the name given to what has become an annual plague of arson .
last year over 200 blazes were reported , and 11 people lost their lives .
tonight may become the biggest and deadliest devil's night ever .
the mayor has firefighters from all surrounding counties

boys .
it seems our friend t bird won't be joining us this evening ... on account of a slight case of death .
you wanna sit down?
well , well , well .
devil's night is upon us again .
i thought we'd throw a little party ... start a bunch of fires , make a little profit .
i like the pretty lights .
problem is , it's all been done before .
you see what i'm saying?
that's no reason to quit .
wrong .
best reason to quit .
only reason to quit .
a man has an idea .
the idea attracts others ...
like minded .
the idea expands .
the idea becomes an institution .
what was the idea?
see , that's what's been bothering me , boys .
but i'll tell ya , when i used to think about the idea itself ... it'd put a big old smile on my face .
you see , gentlemen ... greed is for amateurs .
disorder , chaos , anarchy ... now that's fun !
what about devil's night?
what about it?
i started the first fires in this goddamn city .
before i knew it , every charlatan and shitheel was imitating me .
do you know what they got now?
devil's night greeting cards .
lsn't that precious?
yeah .
the idea has become the institution , boys .
time to move along .
you don't want us to do " light my fire " time for the whole city?
no .
no , i want you to set a fire so goddamn big ... the gods will notice us again .
that's what i'm saying .
i want all of you boys to be able to look me straight in the eye ... one more time and say , " are we having fun or what?
hey , you !
what's your name?
huh?
skank !
you don't feel that?
i feel like a little worm on a big fuckin 'hook .
i feel like a little worm on a big fuckin 'hook .
well , boy , your mama must be damn proud of you !
how the hell did that thing get in here?
gentlemen .
let me go !
let me go !
i gotta go !
you're him , huh?
the avenger .
the killer of killers .
nice outfit .
i'm not sure about the face though .
i just want him .
well , you can't have him .
well ...
i see you have made your decision .
now let's see you enforce it .
aw , this is already boring the shit out of me .
kill him !
ooh , that had to hurt .
well , that's that .
that guy was crazy .
he's gone .
get him !
right here !
here , help me !
he's gonna kill me !
jesus christ !
hey !
you're all going to die .
get the fuck outta here !
guess it's not a good day to be a bad guy , huh , skank?
i'm not skank .
there's skank right there .
skank's dead .
that's right .
no !
what in the crap
don't move !
hold it !
that's all she wrote !
move and we shoot !
you are surrounded by police units .
do not attempt to escape .
stop running immediately .
holy shit ! ... arms and legs
stop immediately .
lie down , spread your arms and legs
come on !
move it !
next time duck .
so many cops , you'd think they were giving away donuts .
shit !
oh .
i knew you were gonna do that .
look at that out there .
the whole city oughta be in flames by now .
sky oughta be red .
so that , i take it , is the late , great eric draven .
he has power , but it is power you can take from him .
i like him already .
the crow ... is his link between the land of the living ... and the realm of the dead .
so , kill the crow and destroy the man .
hmm .
i'm coming home , shelly .
you're gonna say i shouldn't be in the cemetery ... in the middle of the night , right?
safest place in the world to be .
it's 'cause everybody's dead .
i knew you'd come here .
it's really late , sarah .
you didn't say good bye .
you're just gonna have to forgive me for that .
and you're never coming back .
i gave this to shelly once .
i think she'd like you to have it .
this way you'll always remember her .
i'll never take it off .
i better go sneak back in the house .
bye .
shh !
shh !
shh .
take it easy , sweetheart .
come on .
come on .
what is that?
some sort of souvenir there from your pal?
i'll just keep it for good luck .
what do you say , hmm?
her eyes are so innocent .
eric !
eric , help !
eric !
quick impression for ya .
caw !
caw !
bang !
fuck , i'm dead !
give me the girl and i'll let you walk out of here .
well , well .
why don't you just give me a minute to think about that , huh?
nah .
fuck it .
aw , fuck .
well , well , well .
it does seem to me that our little life has undergone ... a rather significant change in the past few minutes now .
wouldn't you agree?
well , for a ghost , you bleed just fine .
it's still alive .
well , then kill it !
bye bye , birdie .
ah , shit .
well , just came by to pay my respects ... and here you are getting all shot up again .
they've taken sarah .
how many?
two more .
i can handle it .
don't worry .
i'm not worried .
look , here's the plan .
you stay in front , and when they run out of ammo , i'll arrest 'em .
that sounds like a great plan .
there's just one problem .
oh , shit .
you're bleeding all over the place .
i thought , you know , you were invincible .
i was .
i'm not anymore .
well , i guess you really will need my help , won't you?
come on .
you take that .
you were supposed to stay behind me .
i think i messed up .
this is all the power you ever had .
now it is mine .
pity there's not more time ...
... for us .
help , eric !
i'm scared !
let me go !
let her go !
you can have me .
i won't fight you .
you can have me .
i won't fight you .
all right .
no !
eric !
sarah?
look out !
eric !
you know , my daddy used to say ...
every man's got a devil ... and you can't rest till you find him .
what happened back there with you and your girlfriend
i cleared that building .
hell , nothing in this town happens without my say so .
so i'm sorry if i spoiled your wedding plans , friend .
but if it's any consolation to you ... you have put a smile on my face .
you got a lot of spirit , son .
i am going to miss you .
i have something to give you .
i don't want it anymore .
thirty hours of pain !
all at once !
all for you .
yeah .
go help him .
are you alive?
god , i need a cigarette .
everybody else dead?
you helped me .
what you kept in here saved me .
thanks .
don't mention it .
i've been meaning to come to church anyway .
oh , yuck .
i'm quitting as of now ... if i live .
stay with him until help comes .
he'll be okay , right?
eric?
he does that a lot .
shelly .
all right , what's going on in there?
multiple homicides .
at least it stopped raining , huh?
it can't rain all the time .
no , i don't believe it .
this nightmare your fault , albrecht?
look , you go on home .
i'm okay .
okay .
want to tell me what's going on?
your vigilante's up on the roof .
you missed it .
get him outta here !
thanks .
buildings burn , people die , but real love is forever .
