seat belt , nat , please .
i'd love to go to india .
it totally turned me around .
really?
yeah , the people there are cool , you know .
they don't worry about material things .
not like here , where traveling's about what kind of car you drive .
it should be about broadening the mind .
that's fine , as long as you've got somebody to do the driving .
i can never wait to get home .
to your husband?
she's divorced .
that's too bad .
not necessarily .
so what do your folks say about you going to all these places?
it's funny , isn't it?
in india they have religious icons in their car .
what do we have?
air fresheners .
i picked up this really amazing cd out there .
you wanna hear it?
yeah , sure .
fuck me .
so , do you see him?
your dad?
sometimes .
what kind of music is this anyway?
sometimes .
what about yours?
your family?
we parted ways a long time ago .
you know what they say , you can choose your friends , but yu can't choose your family .
who says?
sometimes family chooses you .
you can just drop me off at this picnic area coming up on the right .
here .
a very wise person gave that to me once .
he said " nobody in chains soared up to the sun " .
are you sure we can't take you any further?
no .
where are you going?
i'm not sure ... ... but i never get lost any more .
so long .
nice move .

oh no , mom , her cd .
okay , don't panic .
she's not here .
she must be .
look for her .
forgot your cd .
east
west
she's gone .
mom , what are you talking about?
how could she just disappear in thirty seconds?
don't worry .
she never gets lost .
hello?
oh my god , you're kidding?
yeah , yeah , of course i do .
yeah , but what happens if it doesn't arrive in time?
we just passed some picnic area with a grizzly bear statue beside the road .
are you sure?
okay , we'll do that .
thanks .
bye .
anything to report?
yeah , i forgot my birthday present .
but dad said he can bring it to the next rest stop .
you're kidding?
call him up and tell him to send it in the mail .
don't be a drag , he said he could meet us in thirty minutes .
after offering a ride to ms barefoot bombay?
i don't wanna stop again .
thank you .
so what did your dad get you , anyway?
i don't know why you're asking .
it's not like you're interested .
who are all these people?
what are they all doing here?
what are we doing here?
it's natural to be afraid of failure .
but it doesn't have to limit us .
or keep us from realizing our own potential .
from creating opportunities for success in the boardroom ... ... on the playing fields and in the bedroom .
we are bombarded with answers , but are we asking the right questions?
now , i want you to do something for me .
close your eyes .
go on ... ... just for a minute .
close your eyes .
i want you to visualize ... ... a door .
now ... ... reach into your pocket ... ... where there is a key .
feel it?
that key in your pocket ... ... unlocks the door .
only you can open the door .
behind the door is the truth .
go on ... ... unlock the door .
look inside .
face the truth ... ... senga .
hi , dad .
yeah , okay , i'll see you outside .
stay here .
i'll be back in a minute .
senga , thanks for waiting .
which time?
let's see it then .
come on , show me the present .
well , this is great .
not only do you lie to me , but you go straight to your father and sweet talk him .
i didn't lie .
he asked me what i wanted .
hold on , i didn't realize that you two already talked about this .
if you had , do you think she's old enough to go off on her own for a whole weekend in the wilderness?
she's not a kid any more .
she's not exactly an adult either .
if you spent more time with her , you'd understand that .
if you wanna go with her , i don't have a problem in the world with this .
it's not about you and me any more .
if you want to make a scene , do it without me , okay?
this is something you two have to sort out .
god , how familiar this sounds !
dad , we talked about this .
tell her what you think .
i'll call you , sweetheart , okay?
see you .
we'll do something special .
dad !
i'm going and you can't stop me !
you want a bet?
dad !
get used to it , nat .
bailing out is the only thing your father knows how to do well .
i'm not fucking surprised , with you !
why is it only your way is right and nobody else has a say in the matter?
no wonder you screwed up your marriage .
stop it .
you're afraid i might get pregnant young and screw up my life like you did?
well i'm not that stupid .
get in the car .
no .
nat , get in the car now !
no .
fuck you .
i hate you .
nat?
my daughter , she has long hair ... ... we were staying right over there a few minutes ago .
have you seen her?
miss?
pretty face , long hair?
yes , yes , that's her .
i'm sure she went that way with her friend .

natasha .
natasha .
nat?
nat .

they just took her .
you've gotta do something now !
i can't help you i if i can't understand what you're saying .
now , what does your daughter look like?
she's tall and skinny with medium brown hair to here .
i've got a picture .
here .
what was she wearing?
denim jacket and blue jeans .
please get out there and do something .
bear with me .
i need to ask these questions in order to be able to help you .
what's her full name?
natasha wilson .
was she upset in any way?
has she done this kind of thing before?
no , no .
took her , okay?
it was a backpacker and a couple in an rv .
okay , mrs. wilson , you stay put , so we know where to find you .
a local unit will be coming shortly to get your full statement .
what if they leave the freeway?
what if they get away?
ehicle out there does one hundred and fifty miles per ho
they won't get away .
are you familiar with the words of jesus christ?
are you familiar with the words " fuck off "?
shit !
nat?
nat?
i don't like talking about my past life ... ... because it hurts me .
really , do we have to talk about this?
and your father?
i don't even know who my dad was .
not that my mother even knew his last name .
and my mother died ...
chrlstlne
my parents ... they were nice .
but , there were fucking boring .
i mean , really fucking boring , okay .
and my brother , we were close .
we got along but we seemed , like , totally different , i mean ... ... he's a mechanic , and he's gonna be that his whole life .
touch it and i'll rip your fucking neck off .
put your foot down , bitch !
what have you done with my daughter?
shut the fuck up and put your fucking foot down .
faster !
forty five three four seven , civilian call on nine 0 two .
possible crashed or abandoned vehicle by the side of the freeway ... ... approximately three miles east of junction thirty seven .
described as a dark suv or similar .
vehicle remains upright , unknown if persons inside .
relax .
you get any stiffer , rigor mortis will set in .
come on , nat , relax .
i know how you feel .
i had to go through it myself .
you see , nat , there's this whole community of people ... ... just like us .
you know , it's like an extended family .
only better .
it seems like ever since i met the father ... ... my old life feels like it belongs to someone else .
he makes us feel special , like ... ... we finally fit in or belong to something bigger than ourselves .
he's the reason we're all here together .
no time for criticizing
music hypnotizing
everybody's temperature's rising
so get back
how do you feel?
i feel ... ... different .
do you wanna look different?
yeah .
then come on .
you all right?
i just ran my car off the road .
really?
there are a lot of maniacs out here .
you're alive ... ... that's the main thing .
look , could you just ... ... please get my car on the road?
why don't you come with me?
it's not safe out on the freeway .
should see to that cut .
who is this?
that's my sister .
what's her name?
christine .
she's dead .
do you wanna use my phone?
call your husband?
no .
maybe he's worried about you .
i said no .
i'm gonna make the next stop .
and there you can report your accident to the police .
they can help you find your daughter .
it's the bradford district .
right .
thanks a lot .
right .
there's no record of a reported abduction .
in fact , there's nothing matching your daughter's description .
of course not , she's not a real police officer .
do you have a photograph of your daughter?
no , that woman took it .
i told you .
but i saw a picture of another girl in the pick up truck ... ... and then i saw a cassette of the very same girl ...
what has this got to d with your daughter?
if you stop and think about it for a minute ... you'd see that they're all in it together .
the recovery man , the backpacker , the couple with the rv !
we have no record of an officer responding .
no radio broadcasting , no ...
why aren't you calling the fbi right now and reporting my daughter missing?
these people are deranged !
is that what they are?
deranged?
that's her father .
my ex husband .
that's his cell phone .
call him .
sorry to trouble you .
detective stephens here , from bradford police division .
i'm sitting here with a woman ,
senga wilson , she says she's your ex wife .
look , detective , before you go any further ... ... there's something you need to know about my ex wife .
this isn't exactly the first time i've gotten a call like this from the police .
especially at this hour .
she's been on medication since the divorce .
she's delusional .
i understand you have a fifteen year old daughter , natasha , is that correct?
yes , my daughter's here with me now .
she's been with me all weekend .
okay .
i'm afraid senga's wasting everyone's time .
i'm sorry i can't be of more help , detective .
thank you for your time , mr. wilson .
your husband has just told me that your daughter is safe at home with him .
mrs. wilson?
you know , you're obviously very upset ... ... but filing a fraudulent police report is a crime .
you do realize that?
now , look ... ... if you're in a domestic situation ... ... that's okay .
talk to one of our female officers .
god damn it .
come on .
hi , you've reached lois and marek .
bastard .
it's natural to be afraid of failure .
i remember what you remember .
i remember what you remember .
but it doesn't have to limit us .
or keep us from realizing our own potential .
from creating the opportunities for success in the boardroom ... ... on the playing fields and in the bedroom .
we are bombarded with answers , but are we asking the right questions?
now ... ... i want you to ... ... do something for me .
close your eyes .
go on .
just for a minute .
face the truth .
she's gone .
she's with me now .
i know your secrets .
i remember what you remember .
senga .
what have you done with my daughter?

what have you done with her?
tell me where she is?
ma'am , you have to leave the restaurant right now .
i know what you're doing .
before i met the father ... ... the only thing that ever gave me a rush was joyriding .
he's got this amazing power to ... ... work out all the fucked up shit in your life .
yeah ... ... don't get me wrong , i still got a soft spot for jacking cars .
he's gonna love you .
he's ready .
wait , wait , i don't know , i mean , what's gonna happen?
nothing , unless you want it to .
wait , no .
i feel weird .

mom .
nat , run .
nat , leave now , please .

it's all right , nat .
you don't have to go with her .
you don't have to do anything you don't want to .
you're free now .
nat , where are you?
say something .
nobody's gonna hurt you , nat .
she's just terrified of letting you go .
having your own life ... ... your own dreams ...
she just wants to take you away from the ones who understand you .
don't listen to him , nat .
you always knew she was crazy , didn't you?
unhinged . illogical .
a fantastic ... liar .
we wanna give you a real family .
with no lies ... no pills ... ... no restrictions ... ... no screaming matches ... ... just ... love .
that's bullshit , nat .
i'm here .
i can see you .
they wanna kill you !
funny you should mention that .
isn't that exactly what you tried to do?
she tried to kill you .
did you know that?
no .
before you were even born .
she wanted an abortion , nat .
tried to flush you away .
sorry .
i'm sorry .
i remember what you remember .
you gotta hang on .
because the truth is with us in the house tonight .
close your eyes .
see that door .
hold that key .
you don't have to fight any more .
it's over .
come on .
come into the light .
nat ... ... " m sorry you had to see it .
but i had to show you through the hypocrisy and the lies .
pain is all in the past , not in the future .
all you have to do is meet me halfway .
where's my daughter?
i want my daughter back .
what have you done with my daughter?
listen .
you've got to trust me .
nat was the only way i could find them .
there's something you should see first .
they kill people by knocking them off the road .
your husband didn't even get five miles past the rest stop .
come on , nat , don't lose your faith .
join us .
what did you do with her?
nat?
you just don't get it , do you?
this man is not who he says he is .
don't listen to them .
they're full of lies .
i'm calling marek .
he killed your father .
wait , nat .
hey , senga .
see you on the other side .
you stole my sister .
she was my sister too .
hey , senga ... ... " m only here to fill the void .
the void you created ... ... by not listening to who nat really is .
get him out of your head .
this is how he works .
he's got them so fucked up they're killing people for blood .
i was too late for christine .
i had to kill her to stop her from killing anybody else .
you're lucky you're alive .
why can't you just leave me alone?
i'm your mother .
i don't always get things right .
but please , nat , you have to trust me now .
let's get out of here .
let's go .
in here .
now !
come on , nat .
wait .
you killed christine ... ... now i'm gonna kill you .
she was already dead when i found her .
not dead ... free .
the day you tried to murder your daughter is the day you let me in .
truth is in the house tonight ... ... senga .
fuck you .
fuck you .
