i hope the guy who finds it uses it uptown , not here for once !
forget it , we'll get even !
you know that show , " candid camera "?
so this celebrity's sure he's been set up .
his buddy's fixed it with the camera guys .
the celebrity thinks they're out to get him .
he always eats in the same joint .
he's sure they'll film him there .
the others convince him there's a hidden camera .
he sees the tv truck , a camera behind the mirror and the guy with him pretends to act weird .
the celebrity thinks he'll fool 'em , pretending he hasn't noticed .
he thinks all hell will break loose .
but they just film him , jumpy , waiting for shit to happen .
so you see this guy ...
cut it out , sayid !
wasn't me !
then who?
the celebrity's sweating , trying to act cool .
each time the waiter passes he thinks it'll happen .
then a guy asks him for his autograph .
the celeb thinks it's a trick and starts ranting at the guy , who doesn't know what's up , so he gets mad .
they start fighting , and the candid camera guys have to break it up .
it was a killer punch out .
then what?
that's all .
who was the celebrity?
dunno , but he was real famous .
i don't remember .
this looks like trouble .
see ya .
we're the future
what did they want?

that's the wrong question .
does god believe in us?
i once had a friend called grunwalski .
we were sent to siberia together .
when you go to a siberian work camp , you travel in a cattle car .
you roll across icy steppes for days , without seeing a soul .
you huddle to keep warm .
but it's hard to relieve yourself , to take a shit , you can't do it on the train , and the only time the train stops is to take on water for the locomotive .
but grunwalski was shy .
even when we bathed together , he got upset .
i used to kid him about it .
so , the train stops and everyone jumps out to shit on the tracks .
i'd teased grunwalski so much that he went off on his own .
the train starts moving , so everyone jumps on , because it waits for nobody .
grunwalski had a problem : he'd gone behind a bush and was still shitting .
so i see him come out from behind the bush , holding up his pants with his hands .
he tries to catch up .
i hold out my hand , but each time he reaches for it he lets go of his pants and they drop to his ankles .
he pulls them back up , starts running again , but they fall back down , when he reaches out for me .
then what happened?
nothing .
grunwalski ... froze to death .
good day .
why'd he tell us that?
i got the address .
i'll call you .
why'd he tell us that?
'scuse me , i'm just out of the hospital .
i haven't eaten for 2 days .
my child's hungry , i need your spare change ...
i wanna date with mina !
i'll lasso her !
what d'you want?
