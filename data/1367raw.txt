it's not true at all .
no ...
it's journalists , they have this romantic idea of self destruction .
lee wasn't self destructive .
well ... he did everything to excess .
less than the friends he hung around with back then ... they're all complete alcoholics .
it's good they're re releasing his records .
yes , i'm happy about it .
despite the stupid liner notes .
i think they would have made him laugh , too .
yes .
i wasn't gone too long?
no .
so what did you get up to?
did you watch cartoons?
yes .
what did you do when the cartoon was over?
i read .
you read !
what'd you read?
i read md geist .
i thought you read that already .
no , i meant the new one .
i have to tell you something .
we're gonna have to stay in london a bit longer than i thought .
are we going to stay at the hotel?
yes .
do you remember how i told you that the specialists had examined grandma rosemary because she had a very sore back?
yes .
well they don't know what it is that causes the pain .
so they have to keep doing these tests .
so she's gonna stay in the hospital and we're gonna stay together .
are we gonna live in the hotel?
yeah .
the two of us gonna stay in the hotel .
is that okay with you?
yes .
now , tomorrow you'll come with me and we'll go visit grandma rosemary at the hospital .
okay .
sorry , the other day
i was with the head of programming .
i know ... it's the same old thing .
i detect a note of reproach .
not at all .
it's just that i know you .
you're angry about the past .
no .
i'm still angry with you .
you really didn't treat me that nice .
we don't have to see each other .
i can leave now if you like .
no , don't .
if you act up , i won't stay .
stay .
so sandrine says you're moving back to paris ...
i can't go back to london .
too many memories .
what are you going to do now?
i wanted to discuss it with you .
a drink?
the same thing ... a whiskey .
as i was saying i thought i'd talk to you .
i thought maybe you could help ...
maybe , but times have changed .
sure , but times seem to be treating you okay .
yes , because ...
i'm good at my job ... good at corporate politics .
but if i had a little freedom ...
no , please ... forget about it .
you're busy but i wanted to thank you for the show .
it was great .
thank you .
that's so nice of you !
see you soon , i hope .
see you soon .
lee didn't leave you anything?
we weren't married .
we had a joint account .
almost empty .
and your son?
if i want to see him i need to turn my life around .
meaning?
i need a job , for example .
and to stop shooting up .
that's history .
i doubt it .
i said that it's history !
i was on methadone but i stopped taking it .
do you know how often i hear that in my office?
i've known you long enough and i've heard all your lies .
i've changed .
people don't change .
that's your opinion , not mine .
sandrine said you were stoned out of your mind .
you can level with me .
i don't care .
it's your life .
she's pretty , sandrine .
do you sleep together?
no .
she dumped me two months ago .
do you still love her?
two days ago i followed her all night long .
did she know?
yes .
she pretended i didn't exist .
she was with a woman her new lover .
i've known for a while .
i couldn't care less .
this woman has a restaurant near beaubourg .
it's doing okay .
not too pretty , but very maternal .
unlike me .
i did something incredibly stupid .
and it's too late to yell at me .
sandrine stopped by to have me sign something .
i got her into the bathroom locked the door and left .
i swear !
it's not funny !
you're not a kid anymore .
you can't do that !
i know .
pathetic .
is lrene here?
come here .
come closer .
yes , i'd like a taxi .
thank you .
what did you tell her?
that it's over .
are you serious?
dead serious .
you just killed her .
i doubt it .
but i really hope i did .
this way .
through the courtyard .
it's lrene .
she'll call all night to apologize .
you want a whiskey?
i do .
sure .
then i'll be going .
is it true you and lrene were lovers?
it's too much .
i'll get drunk .
so what?
before lee , you were with lrene .
not with her .
but yes ...
we were lovers .
did lee know?
sure he did .
sorry for all the questions .
no need to apologize .
it's no secret .
emily?
emily !
emily !
i got it .
it's heavy .
i'll manage .
yann and henri are friends of jeff's .
hi .
want to see your room?
i thought you'd call last night .
i saw lrene .
any luck?
no , a dead end .
i told you not to count on her .
i crossed that bitch off my list ages ago .
you can unpack .
you can stick the crates in the closet .
like it?
it's great .
the bathroom's that way .
if jeff's dog bothers you just hit him .
beat it !
are you two coming?
we're finishing something .
later .
later .
i told jeff i'd stop by rehearsals .
here are the keys .
for the house and for the gate .
you can always reach me on my cell .
make yourself at home , okay?
see you later .
emily .
what's wrong?
want a painkiller?
i took one .
i wish lee were here .
to take me in his arms .
to tell me it'll be okay .
i'm sick of being alone .
i keep screwing up .
why did he leave me all alone?
hi .
i didn't see you yesterday .
it was my day off .
that's why you were here on sunday and i'll be here again next sunday ...
oh good .
i haven't been to see mrs. hauser yet .
well , they've promised they'd do a scan today .
what did the doctor say?
i don't know , i have a bad feeling ...
are you sure the scan is today?
that's what they told me .
and that's what they said yesterday and the day before ... same thing ...
listen , i don't know all i can do is repeat what they tell me .
i wasn't complaining .
i'm sorry .
it's me i'm feeling tense ...
let me get it .
how are you doing with jay?
fine , fine .
it's the first time you've spent any time with him .
yes .
even with lee , i didn't take much interest until he was ... until he was already a little grownup .
kids intimidate me .
why?
because they understand everything . they read your thoughts they know what you're going to say even before you say it .
so ... what conclusions has jay come to?
he thinks that i'm shy , a bit awkward , pretty boring ... not that smart but i'm smarter than he thinks .
are you?
yes ...
he takes coins from my pockets and he doesn't think i notice ... but i do .
other than that , he wants to see his grandmother .
let's wait until tomorrow .
i spoke to emily .
who?
your daughter in law .
she lives in paris .
she says she's off the drugs .
she's getting a job ...
i think she's having a hard time i don't know , i feel sorry for her ...
albrecht .
yes .
i don't want to talk about her .
of course , but she is jay's mother ... and one day , we're going to have to talk ...
one day , not now .
ronaldo demachy .
hi .
sorry about the wait .
i'll be frank .
i'm seeing you because lrene paolini insisted .
she's someone i respect a lot .
i won't waste your time .
i want things to be perfectly clear .
i think they are .
right .
we're opening a boutique in the printemps department store .
you'll have certain responsibilities , but it's a step above salesgirl .
i understand that .
it's very hard work , and to be honest not very well paid .
i've thought it over and i want it .
do you know our line?
of course .
we target active women with limited means but who expect quality .
not exactly your profile .
but the store attracts a lot of tourists ,
sure .
no problem .
many of them asian , so speaking several languages is a major asset .
come meet madame gregory .
she runs the show here .
she's busy overseeing our new lingerie collection .
obviously you'll have to fit into our mold .
meaning?
you can't dress like you are now .
or like you did on your cable show .
it would look bad .
you saw the show?
it was my generation .
it was a lot of fun .
it was before cable tv caught on .
it was for the happy few .
the cool set .
there's madame gregory .
are you home?
i'm going out soon .
how was it?
awful .
it didn't work out?
yeah , it'll work out .
i don't exactly have a choice .
i learned that in prison .
learned what?
to adapt .
if i want to see jay i have to change my life .
even if the new life sucks .
it's the life most people live .
yeah , but it's grim .
being a junkie was better?
i don't know .
i honestly don't .
you went shopping .
a little .
for jay .
he can sleep downstairs .
don't bother .
i'll make room with me .
he'll be fine .
it's no bother for a weekend .
exactly .
if i only have two days
i want him near me the whole time .
don't get carried away .
what do you mean?
what happens when he has to go?
back to london .
then back to vancouver .
it's far away .
i'm sorry to be harsh .
you're right .
maybe it's better if i don't see him .
i don't know .
why is albrecht coming?
i wrote him to say i'm doing well that i found a job .
i guess he doesn't believe me .
he's checking .
are you up to the test?
i'm trying to change ...
but i don't know if i can take care of a child .
i want a coffee .
i'll meet you inside .
got any change?
remember i told you about gloria?
the girl you met in prison?
she's out .
i thought she was in for a while .
it turns out the case was dismissed .
she called last week .
she wants me to join her .
where?
san francisco .
she found a label .
they like our demos .
be careful .
do you have a contract?
she didn't mention one .
is there any money in it?
they're willing to pay for sessions with a real producer .
what's his name?
david roback .
got a light?
no .
he has a group called mazzy star .
excuse me , do you have a light?
sorry for bothering .
thank you .
they did a few albums .
good stuff .
i remember mazzy star .
but he's only free next week .
to record on monday i'd have to leave on sunday .
i'm not going .
i don't know how to tell gloria .
she'll be disappointed .
tell her you'll come later .
it's now or never .
and jay comes first .
if i go to san francisco i'll fuck everything up .
i've done enough of that .
i won't do it again .
excuse me .
there you are ...
now , did you do what i said?
did you set your stopwatch?
oh yes .
good how long have we been in the tunnel?
4 minutes 35 .
4minutes 35 .
you're right .
what are we going to do in paris?
i've already told you three times we're going to see your mother .
do i have to see her , too?
yes .
can't you go by yourself?
no .
coffee please .
you didn't tell me , i was going to spend the week end with her .
she's your mother .
she killed my dad .
no , she did not !
yes , she did .
grandma rosemary told me so .
jay , you know it was an accident .
no , it wasn't .
he died because he took the drugs she gave him .
come on .
i have to talk to you .
your grandmother and i are old we won't always be here .
what's gonna happen when we're gone?
i haven't finished timing .
stop .
she's your mom .
she loves you and you have to get to know her .
i don't love her and she doesn't love me either .
you're alone .
jay didn't wanna come .
what do you mean , you promised me ...
no , i didn't promise you anything i said i'd come to paris and we'd talk .
no , you said i have him all weekend .
if he doesn't want to i can't force him .
it's not good for you either .
he doesn't want to see me .
he doesn't know you .
he hates me .
i don't know he never talks about you .
i know but ...
if you'd told me earlier ...
i wouldn't have gone my hopes so high .
i'm trying to do my best it's not easy .
i know .
me too .
we have to stay in london .
maybe for a few weeks give him some time .
i'll talk to him ...
you can come over and see us .
i'm sorry i can't do this let's meet another time .
albrecht !
hello .
hello , a table for two .
smoking or no smoking?
smoking .
step this way , please .
thank you .
jay is here , he's with me in paris .
he's at the hotel , it's not far from here .
his grandmother she thinks we're in scotland she doesn't know he came with me here .
how is she doing?
they'll do a little operation next week .
after that , it just depends on the tests .
she seems to think ...
well , to be honest , i can't even mention your name in front of her .
because she thinks that i'm responsible for what happened to lee .
yes .
that and everything else , his decline .
how about you?
i believe in forgiveness people change .
if they need to , they change .
but i don't want to hurt rosemary .
if she thought i'd brought jay here for one second it would tear her apart
i called you back because what you wrote in your letter really moved me .
but you don't trust me .
does that make any difference?
i mean , emily , i'm old i won't always be able to look after jay .
you mean ... by yourself?
yeah , that's it ... that's exactly it .
without rosemary ...
so , have you started your new job?
yeah i sell clothes for active women .
at printemps , it's a department store but i get the weekends off .
printemps somehow i can't imagine you .
it's better than nothing for now .
you'll find something you'll love you'll find something else .
i hope so .
oh , you will .
wait for me i have to talk to him first .
if he doesn't want to , then ...
no .
no .
no of course ...
of course .
i am completely in your hands .
if you choose to , you can run off with him .
you're his mother .
you don't risk much .
i won't .
and you will bring him back by 3 : 40 train tomorrow afternoon?
yes .
i'm sorry emily , i need you to give me your word .
you have my word .
okay .
have you been on a scooter before?
no .
would you like to try?
come on , you'll see ...
it's really fun , come !
are you scared?
no .
since you didn't say anything i thought you were scared .
i'm not scared .
maybe you're scared of me?
no .
your granddad said you were scared of me ...
no .
i'm glad to hear it hold on tight !
let go !
come on .
when i was a kid i only liked tigers and monkeys .
do you like monkeys?
depends which ones .
how about the gorillas?
i have seen gorillas .
where?
in canada at the vancouver zoo .
oh come here , look !
is it nice the vancouver zoo?
much better than this one .
come on , look at the zebras
this one's lame what's it called again?
it's the vincennes zoo .
that's the name of the town .
we're not in paris?
no .
in vancouver there are grizzly bears elks and beavers .
maybe they've got some here .
we can ask .
no .
i've seen enough of them in canada .
they're everywhere .
once one tried to bite me .
one what?
a beaver .
are they dangerous?
no , they're really dumb .
look , there's a baby .
so what do you want to see now?
i want to see a snow leopard with white spots .
a snow leopard , that's a very rare animal .
i'm gonna ask the guy over there .
you wait for me here?
okay .
thank you .
jay ...
jay !
jay !
jay !
do you think that's funny?
no .
me neither .
i don't want to spend the weekend with you now .
why not?
because you killed my dad .
is that what you think?
i'm not the only one .
who else?
everyone .
i didn't kill your dad .
you gave him drugs that killed him .
that's not true .
then why does everybody say you did?
because they don't know .
you're a liar .
come on .
let's just get out of here .
it was me who went and brought the drugs that night .
he tooks some , i took some ...
that's the way it was always between us ...
what's the difference who bought them ...
anything could have happened ...
it could have been lee losing me ...
and you know what?
drugs are more complicated than what most people think they are ...
some people need them because they're suffering because they don't know how to live any other way ... your dad was like that ...
and me too ...
because you're weak .
no , your dad wasn't weak .
he did some really great work but it wasn't easy for him ...
you have to be very strong to do that ...
you should be proud of him .
then how come he needed drugs?
they gave us some really good times .
but afterwards , you always have to pay the price and it's very high .
look at me i'm still paying .
you're not on drugs anymore?
i gave up mainly for you .
why for me?
because otherwise i know i'd never seen you again .
hi sniff , that's jay .
anyone home?
elena's gone out .
here's the box .
thank you .
i'll show you upstairs our room ...
it's on your left .
so this is the room elena lends us .
she is really nice .
you gonna meet her later .
you don't have your own room?
it was in london .
why don't you live in london?
too many memories .
memories of my dad?
yes .
you don't want to remember him?
yes , but not for now it's still too painful .
how about later?
yeah ...
maybe later .
and how about you?
do you like london?
yes .
more than vancouver?
yes .
albrecht and rosemary are nice but they're old and sad .
because your father died .
because rosemary is going to die .
she told you that?
yes .
i'm gonna make some hot chocolate .
do you want some?
okay .
look over there there's some dvds .
choose if there's one you wanna to watch ...
go upthere .
hey , it's gloria .
are you there?
no?
i'm in san francisco , at the triton hotel on grant street .
remember , i told you about it ...
please , please , please , call me back .
david put the sessions off 48 hours to give you one last chance to get here .
i don't know what else to say .
i'll give you the number ...
just a minute it's ...
can i watch this one?
no way .
that's not for kids .
are you going to san francisco?
i don't know ...
i don't think so ...
that's where i was born .
yes .
what's san francisco like?
it's a beautiful city by the sea .
there's a big bridge you must have seen it in photos , no?
if you go , can i come too?
try one of these , they're really good .
are you sure there's not another film that you'd want to watch?
there must be something ...
oh look !
robbie le renne , have you seen that?
you hurry up , alright?
okay .
i wait here .
okay .
emily !
you're bringing him back already?
no , he forgot something .
what?
his hat .
his hat?
i thought he had it with him .
so how's it going?
very well .
has he adopted you yet?
well ...
i forgot to take my magazine .
and your hat ...
but now you have it .
yes .
pull it down over your ears otherwise you'll get cold ...
i've get to talk to your mom , ok?
let's go inside ...
in you go .
what did he get from upstairs?
his passport .
i thought so .
where's he going?
he wants to come to san francisco with me .
i got offered to record some songs there and it's a chance that's never gonna come back .
so you're giving up ...
clothes for active women at printemps , yeah .
good ...
glad to hear it ...
thanks ...
come on ...
i think it's brave of you ...
it's easy to be brave when things are going well ...
but when life is more difficult it's unusual ...
and special .
i'm sure that's what lee would advise you to do .
i have a deal for you .
do i have a choice?
of course you have a choice .
he's your son .
you're his mother .
rosemary is not going to live very long .
i want him to stay with her .
so she can see him now and then ...
so , you go to san francisco and then come join us in london afterwards ...
is that okay with you?
of course ...
it's going to be a very difficult time for me ... and for jay ...
he's gonna need his mother ... to protect him ...
and i'll try and help rebuild a life , ... a new life if that's at all possible ... for both of you ...
okay?
go .
chris , stand by .
i think she's ready , go ahead and roll it .
i saw her coming to me
you will leave here tonight
everybody is in ocean drinking wine from the bar
going home with the stars up in the sky
me
i am down in the light
there's a rhythm
don't ya know it
right here , for everything
there's a lady
she's a killer
silver mountain in her eye
going home with the stars up in the sky
me , i am down in the light
me , i am down in the light
emily , maybe we should take a break for a few minutes .
emily , i really liked it .
i think we should go on and do another song .
alright .
that was so great ...
you're not tired?
no , i'm fine .
ok , great .
