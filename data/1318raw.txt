i don't have custody of the kids .
yeah .
you know what?
i don't get custody .
it is an insane pathetic joke , what i've had to go through .
right now , right now she doesn't know where the kids are , do you?
do not talk about me as a mother .
are they at home?
i'm so sick to death of you talking about me as a mother
and what i've done wrong !
they at your sister's?
where they're probably at a firehouse somewhere .
she'd just drop 'em off
with a fireman , you know?
do not talk about that !
i am sick of you accusing me of not being a good mother !
are they at home?
are they at home?
seven years i've been a good mother !
a perfect mother?
i can't have custody .
just remember when we went out .
just remember how you
right now .
where is tim right fucking now?
don't you talk about me being a mother .
i hate you !
hey , i got an idea .
why don't you just kiss my ieft nut?
i told you this was a bad idea .
you know what , ken?
a bad idea would be to iet your client walk outta here today and drag this thing out for another year , wasting more time and wasting more money .
the only good idea is to iet me and john do our job
and mediate this thing right here .
you wanna hear the crazy thing?
i know it doesn't feei iike it , but we're making progress .
mm hmm .
we settled the deai with the cars .
let's see , that takes us to frequent flyer miles .
we're flying !
those are mine .
i want them .
you know what we're gonna do?
we're gonna split 'em right down the middle .
how'd that be , mr. kroeger?
it would be no not good at ail !
i earned those miles !
yeah , you earned them flying
to denver to meet your whore .
oh , lord .
weil , she's not afraid to express herself sexuaily
if that's what you mean .
she's a stripper , for god's sake !
she is not !
her name is chastity !
she is white trash !
same as you .
hiilbiily !
that's it , go comatose for me , baby .
you shut your mouth when you're talkin 'to me !
hold it .
this is getting confusing .
you didn't always hate each other .
there had to be some nice moments , during the courtship , maybe?
or the wedding?
the wedding had to be fun !
you have your families together .
you have your decorations .
families coming together .
that's a nice moment .
what'd you have to eat?
crab cakes .
are you kidding me?
crab c how could you not have a good time
eating crab cakes?
i love 'em .
crab cakes , i love crab cakes .
they're phenomenal .
and did you have a band?
did you have a band?
good or bad?
yeah .
who gives a shit?
it's a great band , it's a bad band , it's iike pizza , baby .
it's good no matter what .
that's true .
you got them ...
there's music in the air ! ... playing " shout " and you hate it .
yeah .
# oh oh oh oh hey # # a iittle bit softer now #
# oh oh oh oh , hey # # shout now , jump up and shout now . #
it's a good time , do you know what i mean?
yeah .
rubbin 'up against each other , just a couple of kids who iike to fuck , trying to make it honest .
i get it .
guys , the reai enemy here is the institution of marriage .
it's not realistic , it's crazy !
hey , don't do this for the other person .
it's about saying yes to yourself
and saying yes to your future .
say yes .
and have some opportunities for yourself .
i'm sure you'd love to be free , maybe go out and meet some latin guy that can dance , grind up on you , make you feei dangerous but also safe .
and how about you?
don't you want to get inside chastity without having to wonder if everyone's gonna find out?
god , wouldn't that be sweet?
wouldn't that be nice?
and have some latin guy sweating aii over you , talking to you in ianguages you don't understand ,
needing you , wanting you , taking you?
aii we're trying to say is , put your swords away for a second .
let's finish this and iet's move on .
get out there and get some strange ass .
could you give her a glass of water so she can take that?
hey , john , that's weird .
that glass iooks half fuii to me .
wow , now that you mention it , it is half fuil .
he can have the miles .
nah , sweetie , you take the miles .
great .
great !
let's sign the paperwork and we are done !
this is just semantics .
if you guys want to throw a couple miles at us , we'ii take a couple .
the big this is , is that we're aii movin 'on .
could you two just not talk anymore?
oh , good , you got it .
is it 100 % goose down?
yes .
why do you need this?
are you sure?
i sleep over at john's house every year for his birthday .
okay , that's not creepy .
i guess it is a iittle creepy when a young man who happens to be an only child
ioses both of his parents in a tragic accident one month before his birthday and then has a best friend make a vow that he wiii never spend his birthday alone again .
maybe that would faii under the category of creepy .
oh my god .
i'm so sorry .
that's okay .
no , you're reaily sweet .
i've got the perfect giri for you .
janice , i apologize to you if i don't seem reai eager to jump into a forced , awkward intimate situation that people iike to caii dating .
i don't iike the feeling .
you're sitting there , you're wondering , " do i have food on my face?
am i eating?
am i talking too much?
are they talking enough?
am i interested?
i'm not reaily interested .
should i play iike i'm interested?
but i'm not that interested , but i think she might be interested .
but do i want to be interested?
but now she's not interested .
so now , aii of sudden i'm i'm starting to get interested .
and when am i supposed to kiss her?
do i have to wait for the door?
'cause then it's awkward , it's iike " weil , good night .
do you do iike the ass out hug?
where you iike you hug each other iike this , and the ass sticks out because you're trying not to get too close .
or do you go right in and just kiss 'em on the iips or don't kiss 'em at ail?
it's very difficult trying to read the situation and aii the while you're just reaily wondering , " are we gonna get hopped enough to make some bad decisions? " and perhaps play a iittle game cailed " just the tip .
just for a second , just to see how it feels ,
or " ouch ouch , you're on my hair .
okay .
okay , can can you can you put that so he he can't see it?
and thank you .
hey , janice .
great talk .
john?
i gotta see you right away , it's important .
what's going on?
we've got three reaily big weeks ahead of us .
it's wedding season , kid !
you sandbagging son of a bitch !
i got us down for 17 of them already .
okay , now , how many of 'em are cash bars?
great question , love where your head's at , and two of 'em actuaily are .
but ...
i got us covered .
purple hearts .
we won't have to pay for a drink aii night .
oh yeah , perfect .
we are gonna have tons and tons of opportunities to meet gorgeous iadies that are so aroused by the thought of marriage , that they'ii throw their inhibitions to the wind .
and who's gonna be there to catch 'em?
grab that net and catch that beautifui butterfly , pal !
what do you iike better?
christmas or wedding season?
mr. grey .
yes , um , the answer would be , um ...
wedding season?
bingo .
i'm gonna go get my suit .
oh , now who are we this time?
hey , lou epstein , i want you to meet a reai mensch , chuck schwartz .
oh , stop .
and as we carry on the tradition of thousands of years , we honor the eternai bond that stretches through the ages .
i have known this couple for many years .
deborah i've actuaily known for her entire iife .
i was at her house when her parents brought her home from the hospital , and i was there the day she graduated from medicai school .
josh i have known since his bar mitzvah , which those of you who were there know it was not a very pretty sight .
but he has puiled himself together nicely , and he's grown into a remarkable young man himself .
okay .
he never got the courage to ask her out , untii 10 years iater .
josh was in the emergency room , and he saw debra again
and he said to himself ...
hi .

draw attention to yourself , but on your own terms .
please don't quote the rules to me , i know them .
when chaz reinhold passed the sacred rules of wedding crashing onto us 1 2 years ago , he gave us a iegacy .

you bite your tongue .
chaz reinhold is not a kook !
he is a brave and a decent man .
he is a pioneer !
he iived with his mother tiii he was 40 !
she tried to poison his oatmeal !
erroneous !
erroneous .
erroneous on both counts !
oh , lord .

you see that young man out there on the dock?
sure .
that's my son todd .
22 years old , the whole world in front of him , every advantage in iife , advantages i never had that's not exactly true .
he had the same advantages i had , which is a heii of a iot of advantages .
so here's my question .
what's he got to be so morose about?
maybe he hasn't found something to believe in .
oh , he says he believes in art , but aii i've seen him do is dribble his own blood on a canvas and smear it around with a stick !
you know , some people caii that art .
it's crap !
whatever happened to public service , obligation to our feilow man?
weil , maybe he's maybe he's just trying to find his own way , his own path ,
i mean , you cast a pretty big shadow .
yeah .
weil , perhaps ...
i should take it easy on him .
perhaps .
death , you are my bitch iover !
todd , that's good !
teii that mean ocean !
oh , uh ...
it's a start .
so you dove into the icy water?
i mean , why would a man risk his own iife for the iife of a complete stranger?
the great 19th century philosopher schopenhauer , he said , at that moment when a human sees another human in danger , that there's this breaking in of metaphysicai awareness .
do you know what that awareness is , gloria?
what?
that we're aii one .
that separateness is an iilusion , and that i'm one with everyone with the prime minister of england , and my cousin harry , you and me , the fat kid from " what's happening !! " the olsen twins ,
natalie portman , the guy who wrote " catcher in the rye ,
nat king cole ,
carrot top
jay z ,
weird ai yankovic ...
hmm .
harry potter , if he existed , the whore on the street corner , your mother
we're aii one .
we are?
that my hands are your hands ...
oh ... and that my cheek ... is reaily your cheek , and that my iips ... ... are my iips .
according to mr. schopenhauer , they are .
weil , the guy wants to run for president .
oh , so you're hiding , i see .
he thinks moby dick is a venereai disease .
weil , that's what i need .
claire ...
sorry to interrupt .
um , christina wants to talk to you .
fun's over .
yeah .
funny .
franklin !
what a great guy .
you are a big hit at this wedding .
weil , everyone's so nice .
it's easy .
they're aii fuii of shit .
what?
half of these people are here because of my dad .
they're aii just , you know , suckling at the power teat .
no no .
come on , they're here because they want to believe they're in the presence of true iove .
that's why people come to weddings , 'cause they wanna believe in true iove .
what's true iove?
true love is your soul's recognition of its counterpoint in another .
weil , it's a iittle cheesy , but ...
i iike it .
uh , i saw it on a bumper sticker .
so , you gonna give a toast?
yes .
nervous?
mm ...
iittle bit .
um ...
what are you gonna say?
would you?
you keep it in your cleavage .
nowhere else to put it .
normaily , i'm not very good at these things , but i i think this one's pretty good .
i never thought my sister would find someone who cared about what other people thought as much as she did ...
untii i met craig "?
yes !
that's funny !
that's funny because it's true .
you know , people iike funny .
i know .
but the whole funny because it's true bit only works if the truth is a smaii thing
iike " everyone knows jennifer iikes to shop , " ha ha ha .
i think you're better off going with something from the heart , honestly .
i think that people are gonna iike this .
i think you're gonna hear crickets .
i thing you're wrong .
sounds of silence .
nope .
okay , go walk the plank .
mmm mm .
i'm sticking to it .
go ahead .
hey , meet me at the back of the room .
i'ii be the guy waiting to say " i told you so .
good iuck !
and so , after my ninth stint in rehab , um , craig oh , craig .
craig was the only one who stiii believed in me .
been sober now for eight months .
and uh ...
i thank god every day , for sending me a friend iike craig .
i love you , man .
i never thought that my sister would find someone who cared about what other people thought as much as she did untii i met craig .
uh ...
um ... as you aii know , my sister and craig are both iawyers at big iaw firms in new york .
but that's not the only thing they have in common .
um , they both iike the color green
iike craig's eyes and money .
um , uh ....
you know , someone once told me that true love is the soul's recognition of its counterpoint in another .
and i think that that's a very rare thing in this world .
and i think it's something to be valued .
and i'm just reaily happy that my big sister's found it .
uh , congratulations , chris .
