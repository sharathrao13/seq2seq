what are your cells , eight by eight?
ours are nine by nine .
no big deal .
listen , you seem like a really nice guy , but i just don't date cops .
i'm not much of a cop , really .
more like a civilian trapped in a cop's body .
oh .
well , i hear you can get an operation for that .
but then , i guess you'd miss out on all those wacky things you highway guys do .
yeah , those stories about us are mostly lies , really .
except for the one about how we pulled over ac/ dc's bus ... and then they flew us down to jamaica to party with them ; that one's true .
but , yeah , other than that , it's pretty boring out there .
yeah , well , i wouldn't know .
all right , it's probably time for you to get out of here .
i don't want to get fired too .
oh , i'm not getting fired .
i'm gettin 'shut down .

i got a theory , cap .
these , uh , bales of pot , they have that red johnny chimpo sticker on them .
and that dead woman in the winnebago had the same logo tattooed on her back .

like a brand name .
see !
where'd you learn that , cheech?
drug school?
shut up , farva .
did that bag you pulled off those college kids have that sticker?
um ...
i don't believe it did .
was there any marijuana on that winnebago?
nope .
a monkey tattoo .
sounds kinda flimsy .
what's the significance of this john chimpo fella?
uh , well , you know those really cheap japanese cartoons?
no?
this is basically a cheaper afghani knockoff .
it's this monkey that basically travels around the world ... uh , doing nasty things .
his butler tries to keep him in line , but , uh no .
it's really funny , cap .
it's afghanistanimation .
the monkey has a butler?
great .
is that what they do in arabia , thorny?
how the hell should i know?

i don't think that's such a good idea , thorn .
uh , right .
okay , why don't you just sit in the middle , buddy?
ursula , what the fuck?
there's no t. p. in the bathroom .
what about the piece stuck to your shoe?
what about that piece?

you know , you might get ahead around here if you made the extra effort .
do you want me to wipe your ass?
that's not what i
well , around my house , my wife knows to refill the t. p.
i'm not your wife , smy .
no .
and if you were , i'd take you down a peg or two .

he strangles her and puts her face in pig food?
what an asshole .

yeah .
jane doe .
do you know her?
oh , we're working on it .
it's called routine police work .
apparently , she had a cartoon monkey tattooed on her back .
john chimpo , i'm told .
and those cannabis bags in our truck ... those stickers had the same monkey logo .
so we think there might be some kind of connection .
are you suggesting that a cartoon monkey is bringing drugs into our town?
look , i know we don't like each other .
i like you .
come on !
i'm looking for a little cooperation here .
john chimpo .
hanson , could you round up , uh , johnny chimpo ... and , uh , jerry giraffe and arty the alligator and bring them in for a lineup .
thanks , sweetie .
sounds like they're having fun .
that's what happens when you start hanging out with a state trooper .
we show you the funny .
well , where were we?
uh , you were laying your best rap on me and i was resisting .
but you were starting to think about it .
i told you .
i don't touch highway hog .
baby , i'm sizzle lean .
i scratched your back , bruce .
i scratched it good and hard .
now , either you scratch my back or you're gonna get my size ten boot up your ass !
desperation is a stinky cologne , john .
let's see .
you are an expendable line item on a state spending bill .
you have a station full of crappy cops .
i am about this far away from having a bigger budget .
and now , you come in here talking about ... monkey tattoos on some drunk lady's tit like it's a goddamn drug conspiracy .
keep your bags packed , john .
let us handle the real police work , huh?
uh , john , when you do get shut down , you come back , talk to me .
i can always use a good meter maid .

i think it's gonna happen .
we don't want to leave .
we really like this town .
i'll probably just get sent down to brattleboro .
it's a nice town .
i don't think it's a healthy time for him to move .
he's got a lot of real good friends here .
who?
that creepy kid with the lisp?
hey .
stop jumping on the bed .
look , i don't want to go without you .
then you should stay here .
but i can't if they transfer me .
hey , stop jumping on the bed .

i'm gonna show you where the wild goose goes .
oh , this isn't happening .
i i i'm a police officer .
ursula , help !
baby , i'm gonna butter your bread .
you don't have these at your station?
i don't suppose you got a pair of fresh underwear i could borrow?
i'm not sure you could fit into my panties .
you know , you can't tell anybody about this .
i already told my mom about you .
ohh !
whoa !
whoa !
whoa !
whoa !
shit !
baby , you rocked me .
wow !
what is this?
rabbit , you're off the road !
shut up , farva !
it's a good move , cap .
rabbit , you're on radio .
farva , you're ridin 'with thorny .
wait a minute  what do you want me to do about it?
my hands are tied !
it's all over the police band !
rabbit , you couldn't have picked a worst time !
i got a q 17 request form today .
we have to inventory our equipment .
which means our balls are this close to the band saw .
what are you sellin ', mac , hot dogs?
there's a new billboard .
casino le fantastique?
let me guess .
you just humped the mayor's wife and burnt down city hall .
i'll do you one better , captain .
so i'm walkin 'down by the local police station , minding my own business .
but there's something funny in the air .
i feel like i just gotta get into that winnebago .
so after i jimmy the door , i do a quick recon .
bullshit .
i can see there's something not right about that bed .
so i busted it in .
bullshit .
and just sittin 'there were ten huge duffel bags of these mothers .
let me get this straight .
you went into the impound , scaled the fence ... broke into the winnebago and smashed the bed , all on a hunch?
i'll believe that when me shit turns purple and smells like rainbow sherbet .
what?
do you think i just grew this weed?
how could you know to look underneath the bed?
it must have been my sixth or even my seventh sense .
you know , rabbit , a good cop doesn't really know why he does anything .
disregard that , rabbit .
and you didn't even think to call in your partner?
so these local mothers have got a hundred keys of chiba and don't know it?
not a clue .
it's totally hidden .
and grady's walkin 'around like he's hot soup .
all right , we got a chance here .
but we got to beat these guys to the punch .
mac , you and foster check out the truck stops ... and find out what you can about galikanokus and bunty soap .
i'll talk to grady and play a little hardball .
thorny , i'm takin 'a hard line .
you got to promise me no more bullshit .
cap , you know i'm cool , but i can take no responsibility for these white devils .
well , you're gonna have to .
now , rodney , we're under a lot of pressure here .
remember what we talked about .
if anything happens ... count to ten , take some deep breaths .
ten deep breaths .
i got it , cap .
foster , you re on duty .
trust me , skipper , we'll make you proud .
you are awesome .
you are incredible .
you are a fantastic cop .
keep goin '.
uh , and then somebody said , i think it was o'hagan , said , um ...
" foster , you deserve a promotion .
hmm .
i think you get a star .
mm .
foster?
wait .
i don't know if this is gonna work .
this steering wheel is jabbing my ass .
oh , right .
ow !
okay .
in new york city , a guy could pay ten bucks to watch two cops have sex in a cage .
yeah?
oh .
foster?
yeah?
in our cruisers , somebody has to let you out of the back seat .
oh , fuck it !
do we look like the two dumbest guys in the world to you?
is that why you choose to treat us with such disrespect?
look , all i'm sayin ', man , is switch partners .
it'll be fun .
i don't think so .
come on , mix it up a bit .
mm , no fuckin 'way .
come on , mac , you know you're always sayin 'how funny foster smells .
oh , look out for thorny , master of psychology .

all right , assholes , quit talkin 'about me .
lock and load , ramathorn .
let's kick some tail .
we weren't talkin 'about you , you big idiot .
bullshit .
truck stop , huh?
we gotta do it .
but the captain didn't say anything about going undercover .
do you think they're gonna tell us anything if they know we're cops?
get a job , man !
look , you're fuckin 'super cop .
you should know this .
i am super .
plus , we can't take our car ... until they replace the door you , for no reason whatsoever , removed last night .
i told you it was those kids with the wrenches .
ah , yes , those ballsy little punks who took your car door off ... while you were sittin 'in the damn thing .
i told you i was in a very deep sleep .
yeah .
you wanna tell that to o'hagan?
maybe we can borrow his car today .
do you even know how to drive this thing?
shit !
this rig sucks !
aha !
uh , who knew it was a stick?
how about we , uh , pop a couple of viagra ... and issue tickets with raging , mega huge boners?
only you , farva , can make a dark man blush .

the lice hate the sugar .
listen , rod  it's delicious .
uh , good .

we're not gettin 'shut down , grady .
we're drug busters .
maybe they're drug busters , but you're dispatch .
nuh uh .
i'm back on the road , now .
until this little incident .
listen , rod .
this whole murder thing , we've been tryin 'real hard to break it open ... but o'hagan just will not cooperate with the evidence .
now i've spoken to the governor myself .
she is gonna shut your station down , son .
it's gonna happen .
now , i'm gonna have a bigger budget then , and i could really use ... a good local officer like yourself .
could i go now?
you could have your own car .
work on exciting cases .
hey , we could even chase drug dealers together .
now , the thing is , rod ...
i really need to know about your side of the investigation .
o'hagan's making all kinds of threats , and
can we make a deal?
i'm all highway .
let him loose .
sorry about that , bro .
hey , charlie's angel .
what's up?
guys .
hey .
well , we got about , uh , twenty desk lamps .
farva went schizoid .
that's good .
how did the undercover thing go?
well , not so good .
turns out , this guy can't drive a semi .
yeah .
you guys watch that johnny chimpo thing?
funny , but nothin 'there .
mm .
maybe you missed something .
mm , trust me , bro .
there's nothing there .
maybe we should take another look .
that's it , you're off the road .
never again .
sir , no .
it was not my fault .
neither was the goddamn school bus .
you know , there was a time we'd take a guy like you out back and beat you .
now you got your goddamn unions .
i'm not a pro union guy .
and you're banned from dimpus burger .
damn it !
get some rubber gloves .
from now on , you're my cleaning lady .
beat it !
well , the butler is basically saying to johannes chimpo ...
don't let the great satan tempt you with the western culture .
you must remain true to the taliban warlord .
cool beans .
so , um , galikanokus is not the butler?
well , possibly .
but this is , uh , quite brilliant , really .
and so , captain , you think there might be some connection with the smugglers?
rabbit , get this meatball out of here .
you got it , captain .
come on , meatball .
we should probably do that .
back in the cage with your beautiful wife , huh?
what did you find out at the weigh station?
my cruiser weighs 16, 000 kg .
i just got off the phone with tom mccardle from the budget committee .
this thing with farva screwed our pooch .
what?
they can't lump us in with that fuckin 'martian .
we're all in the same boat .
but our shenanigans are cheeky and fun .
yeah .
his shenanigans are cruel and tragic .
which makes them not shenanigans at all , really .
evil shenanigans .
i swear to god i'll pistol whip the next guy that says , " shenanigans .
hey , farva !
what's the name of that restaurant you like , with all the goofy shit on the walls ...
and the mozzarella sticks?
you mean shenanigans?
no !
oh !
you're talking about shenanigans , right?
put those away !
hey , rabbit .
yeah , i know .
you got beautiful , big brown lips .
yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah .
have your fun , boys .
have your fun .
'cause i'm gonna start looking for for a new job .
hey !
urs !
ha !
hi .
hi .
sorry i'm late .
the mayor came down today .
ah , biker !
i'm an idiot .
boy , you guys just keep shooting yourselves in the foot .
heard you got to see farva naked .
yeah , it was hard to miss .
so , grady thinks he's got you guys by the balls .
yeah .
how do you feel about long distance relationships?
think i'm getting sent to deer lick .
well , i've been thinking about this .
i think i might have an idea .
the governor comes to town on saturday for that big thing , right?
she's gonna make a big speech about drugs and law enforcement ...
and all of that because of your bust .
she's gonna shut us down .
no !
not if you give her more .
get the reefer out of the winnebago and give it to her during the party .
make a big show of it .
with all that media there , she would love us for it .
no way she'll shut you down .
that reefer's locked in the winnebago ... which is locked in your impound , which is guarded by assholes .
all right .
here's what i'll need .
five ski masks , a case of smoke bombs the good ones
and banana peels , lots of banana  foster?
how about if i just help you get in?
you would do that for me?
yeah .
what the hell .
we'll work together .
like cagney and lacey .
yeah .
well , cagney and lacey were women .
but  i could be lacey .
mac o !
so that's it , huh?
c. c. s. rockman bulletproofing is the tops !
same guys who make our flak jackets .
now , rabbit , a good cop does what ... before using his equipment in the field?
uh , they test it?
they test it .
exactly .
how are you shootin 'today , thorn?
dead on all morning .
how about that little fella?
oh , that little guy?
i wouldn't worry about that little guy .
good enough for me .
you're my man , now .
i don't get it .
how are we going to get into the local impound?
there are gonna be cops there .
wa hoo !
most of the local cops will probably already be at the banquet .
they'll leave , like , one or two of the dumbest guys at the station .
how are you feelin 'there , mac?
good enough to fuck your mother !
so , what we have to do is distract whoever they leave there .
hey , mac !
you still have that halloween costume?
oh , hell , yeah .
you don't throw out
wa hoo hoo !
damn , that's good !
so , if we can get ten minutes , you and i can get into the impound ... get the reefer , and get it to the governor before she leaves?
nice and easy .
i like it .
you're up .
me?
now , don't get puke on it .
does it hurt?
you're gonna feel a little pinch .
lookin 'good , rabbit !
now don't move !
hang on , buddy .
hey , cap !
hey , captain .
bulletproof cup , huh?
i invented this gag , rabbit .
only in my day , the rookie got naked .
whoa , whoa , whoa !
and we also used blanks .
you're a sick motherfucker , mac .
thanks , chief .
all right , thorny .
why'd you call me up here?
good to know you're still battin 'for us with the budget committee , mayor .
well , i don't want to mince words , john , but it doesn't look too good .
maybe not to the untrained eye .
but if i was a bettin 'man , i'd put money on us changin 'the governor's mind tonight .
well , you might want to strap on your ass kissing boots and start right now .
i think she's your only hope .
hello .
what is this thing again?
humane society?
uh , it's a drug bust .
cocaine?
hello .
uh , marijuana .
then why are we here?
oh , i think we're pretty well covered , mr. mayor .
i think she's got a lot of decisions to make .
i don't envy her .
oh , i do .
i'll be lucky to have a figure like that when i'm her age .
yeah .
that's a good one .
we're sending someone down , don't worry .
okay .
thanks .
you bet .
no , no , no , no .
we'll bring the guns .
we're on it .

i mean , no offense , bro , but ... when did you become a cop?
none taken , ramathorn .

that's fine police work .
thank you very much .
the real credit ... goes to my skilled officers , who uncovered the marijuana in that winnebago .
and , uh , we have identified the dead woman from that winnebago ... as a drug " queenpin " from louisville , kentucky lucy garfield .
or , as we like to call her down at the station , " the louisville smuggler .
there will be no more running of marijuana ... through spurbury on my watch .

due to our tight fiscal situation ...
we regret to inform you that we are still ...
going to have to close your station .
