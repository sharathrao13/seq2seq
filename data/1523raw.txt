the city has fallen silent .
there is no warmth left in the sun .
it grows so cold .
it's just the damp of the first spring rain .
i do not believe this darkness will endure .
look , the orcs ... ... they're moving off .
you see , mr. frodo ... ... some luck at last .
move it , you slugs !
come on !
faster !
come along , you scum ....
i'll whip you down to the bone , you ....
come on !
what have i told you? !
get up !
come on , you slugs !
you two are going straight to the front line !
now , move it !
go on !
fall in !
move it !
to the gate , you slugs !
now , move it !
don't you know we're at war?
company , halt !
inspection !
sam , help me .
mr. frodo !
stand up , mr. frodo .
stand up !
it's so heavy .
oh , no .
what do i do?
what do we do?
hit me .
what?
hit me , sam .
start fighting .
get off of me !
nobody pushes me , you filthy maggot .
get off of me !
break it up !
break it up !
oi !
i'll have your guts if you don't shut this rabble down !
go , sam .
now !
move along , scum !
back in the line !
you maggots !
get back into the line , you slugs !
dig it , you slugs .
move it .
move it !
i can't ....
i can't ....
i can't manage the ring , sam .
it's ....
it's ....
it's such a weight to carry .
it ....
such a weight .
we're going that way .
straight as we can .
there's no point carrying anything we're not sure to need .
mr. frodo .
look .
there is light ... ... and beauty up there ... ... that no shadow can touch .
take mine .
there's a few drops left .
there will be none left for the return journey .
i don't think there will be a return journey , mr. frodo .
frodo , get down !
hide !
frodo !
where are they?
let the lord of the black land come forth !
let justice be done upon him !
my master , sauron the great , bids thee welcome .
is there any in this rout with authority to treat with me?
we do not come to treat with sauron ... ... faithless and accursed .
the armies of mordor must disband .
he is to depart these lands , never to return .
old greybeard .
i have a token i was bidden to show thee .
frodo .
frodo .
silence .
no !
silence !
the halfling was dear to thee , i see .
know that he suffered greatly at the hands of his host .
who would've thought one so small could endure so much pain?
and he did , gandalf .
he did .
and who is this?
isildur's heir?
it takes more to make a king than a broken elvish blade .
i guess that concludes negotiations .
i do not believe it .
i will not .
pull back .
pull back !
it's gone , mr. frodo .
the light's passed on , away towards the north .
something's drawn its gaze .
hold your ground !
hold your ground .
sons of gondor , of rohan , my brothers !
i see in your eyes ... ... the same fear that would take the heart of me .
a day may come when the courage of men fails ... ... when we forsake our friends and break all bonds of fellowship .
but it is not this day .
an hour of wolves and shattered shields ... ... when the age of men comes crashing down .
but it is not this day .
this day we fight !
by all that you hold dear on this good earth ... ...
i bid you stand , men of the west !
never thought i'd die fighting side by side with an elf .
what about side by side with a friend?
aye .
i could do that .
do you remember the shire , mr. frodo?
it'll be spring soon .
and the orchards will be in blossom .
and the birds will be nesting in the hazel thicket .
and they'll be sowing the summer barley in the lower fields ... ... and eating the first of the strawberries with cream .
do you remember the taste of strawberries?
no , sam .
i can't recall the taste of food ... ... nor the sound of water ... ... nor the touch of grass .
i'm ... ... naked in the dark .
there's there's nothing .
no veil between me and the wheel of fire .
i can see him ... ... with my waking eyes .
then let us be rid of it ... ... once and for all .
come on , mr. frodo .
i can't carry it for you ... ... but i can carry you .
come on !
aragorn .
elessar .
for frodo .
look , mr. frodo .
a doorway .
we're almost there .
clever hobbits to climb so high !
mustn't go that way .
mustn't hurt the precious .
you swore !
you swore on the precious !
smagol promised !
smagol lied .
frodo !
eagles .
the eagles are coming !
frodo !
i'm here , sam .
destroy it !
go on !
now !
throw it in the fire !
what are you waiting for?
just let it go !
the ring is mine .
no .
no .
no !
yes !
yes !
precious !
precious !
precious !
precious !
give me your hand !
take my hand !
no !
don't you let go .
don't let go .
reach !
frodo !
frodo !
it's gone .
it's done .
yes , mr. frodo .
it's over now .
i can see the shire .
the brandywine river .
bag end .
gandalf's fireworks .
the lights in the party tree .
rosie cotton dancing .
she had ribbons in her hair .
if ever i was to marry someone ... ... it would've been her .
it would've been her .
i'm glad to be with you , samwise gamgee ...
... here at the end of all things .
gandalf?
frodo !
gimli !
now come the days of the king .
may they be blessed .
this day does not belong to one man ... ... but to all .
let us together rebuild this world ... ... that we may share in the days of peace .
my friends ...
... you bow to no one .
and thus it was .
a fourth age of middle earth began .
and the fellowship of the ring ... ... though eternally bound by friendship and love ... ... was ended .
thirteen months to the day since gandalf sent us on our long journey ... ... we found ourselves looking upon a familiar sight .
we were home .
hi .
hey , watch the pumpkin .
more of the same , rosie .
good night , lads .
how do you pick up the threads of an old life?
how do you go on ... ... when in your heart you begin to understand ... ... there is no going back?
there are some things that time cannot mend ... ... some hurts that go too deep ... ... that have taken hold .
there and back again ... a hobbit's tale , by bilbo baggins
mr. frodo?
what is it?
it's been four years to the day since weathertop , sam .
it's never really healed .
a hobbit's tale by bilbo baggins .
and the lord of the rings by frodo baggins .
you finished it .
not quite .
there's room for a little more .
bilbo once told me his part in this tale would end ... ... that each of us must come and go in the telling .
bilbo's story was now over .
there would be no more journeys for him ... ... save one .
tell me again , lad , where are we going?
to the harbour , bilbo .
the elves have accorded you a special honour ... ... a place on the last ship to leave middle earth .
frodo ... ... any chance of seeing that old ring of mine again?
the one i gave you .
i'm sorry , uncle .
i'm afraid i lost it .
oh .
pity .
i should like to have held it one last time .
well , here's a sight i have never seen before .
the power of the three rings is ended .
the time has come ... ... for the dominion of men .
the sea calls us home .
i think i'm ... ... quite ready for another adventure .
farewell ... ... my brave hobbits .
my work is now finished .
here at last , on the shores of the sea ... ... comes the end of our fellowship .
i will not say , " do not weep " ... ... for not all tears are an evil .
it is time , frodo .
what does he mean?
we set out to save the shire , sam .
and it has been saved .
but not for me .
you don't mean that .
you can't leave .
the last pages are for you , sam .
you cannot always be torn in two .
you will have to be one and whole for many years .
you have so much to enjoy and to be and to do .
your part in the story will go on .
well ... ...
i'm back .
lay down
your sweet and weary head
night is falling
you have come to journey's end
sleep now
and dream of the ones who came before
they are calling
from across the distant shore
why do you weep?
what are these tears upon your face?
soon you will see
all ofyour fears will pass away
safe in my arms
you're only sleeping
what can you see
on the horizon?
why do the white gulls
call?
across the sea
a pale moon rises
the ships have come
to carry you home
and all will turn
to silver glass
a light on the water
all souls pass
hope fades
into the world of night
through shadows falling
out of memory and time
don't say
we have come now to the end
white shores are calling
you and i will meet again
and you'll be here in my arms
just sleeping
what can you see
on the horizon?
why do the white gulls
call?
across the sea
a pale moon rises
the ships have come
to carry you home
and all will turn
to silver glass
a light on the water
grey ships pass
into the west
