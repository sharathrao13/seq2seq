okay , remain calm .
how you doing?
what's up?
what's up?
what's up?
what you are watching is live footage of a vehicle , apparently stolen , being pursued by police .
we're receiving word now that the driver of that vehicle is former pittsburgh football star paul crewe .
crewe , you might remember , was the only man ever to be indicted on federal racketeering charges for shaving points in a professional football game , although it was never fully proven .
yeah !
heilo .
do not get one more scratch on my car , or i wiii slit your throat .
see , that's our problem , sweetie .
you care about this car more than you do us .
and how'd you even know there was a scratch on this baby?
because i am watching you on tv , as is the whole country .
once again , you are proving to everyone what a worthless piece of shit you are .
weil , i hope they iike this .
hey , lena !
l think we should start seeing other people !
i think i'm in iove .
good news , boys , i didn't spiii my beer .
without question , crewe's five year federal probation for point shaving has been severely violated tonight .
the future of this once great football star looks very dark indeed .
long way from the big city , huh , superstar?
staying with the times around here , huh?
ain't she beautiful?
home sweet home , boy .
get on your feet .
you're one iucky son of a bitch , crewe .
is that right?
that's right .
see , the warden ioves his footbail .
fact , he was on the winning side of your iittle thing .
weil , teii him congratulations .
but i wasn't .
welcome to ailenviile .
thank you , sergeant .
i'ii take it from here .
afternoon , inmate crewe .
yeah .
come on .
warden wants to see you .
let's do it .
move it .
i used to play a iittle coilege baii myself .
down at the university of miami .
i bet a iot of your old teammates are iocked up in here .
no inmates from my playing days .
couple of guards , though .
see , we got us a fine prison guard ieague down here .
it's iike a company softbaii team .
now , the warden ... ... he's gonna ask you to help out .
okay .
with what?
that wasn't nice .
when the warden asks you , what are you gonna say?
yes?
you're gonna teii him " no .
you got it?
you're gonna teii the warden that you want nothing to do with his footbaii fantasies .
not in my back yard .
because the warden don't run this prison .
i do .
you understand?
not entirely .
okay .
i feei you , dog .
i feei you .
paui " wrecking " crewe .
i don't get to say this to my new guests very often , but it's an honor to have you here at this institution .
it's an honor to be iocked up here , sir .
oh , weil , this is erroi dandridge .
colonei sanders been eating his own chicken .
he's my politicai adviser .
see , i've been approached by severai very influentiai people wondering if i'd be interested in standing for governor .
they see the way i run this prison , think maybe i should run this state .
only with iess sodomy , right?
hopefuily none .
sorry .
now , there are two things we take very seriously here in the state of texas .
prison and footbail .
we play a iittle of the iatter here .
the warden is too modest to admit that his team is rather good .
but not good enough .
five years since our iast championship .
five years .
now , i've worked reai hard , puiled strings , cailed in quite a few favors to get you here , paul .
now , why would you go and do that?
because i am convinced that you can get us back on track .
i haven't played footbaii in i don't know how iong .
i don't reaily want to .
you wouldn't be playing , paul .
just consulting .
anyone who was once the mvp of the nationai footbaii league must have a great deai of expertise to offer .
captain , what would you say to mr. crewe iooking in , giving us the benefit of his experience?
i think that's a reai good idea , warden .
we can use aii the help we can get .
weil , then , it's aii settled .
what you say , paul?
i appreciate the offer , but i'm gonna have to pass .
now , i can assure you that your time here wiii be a whole iot easier if you just participate .
i just wanna do my time and go home .
nothing else .
if you'ii excuse us , mr. crewe .
captain knauer , you can stay .
sit down !
i used to love your underwear commercials .
thank you very much .
my ex husband wore the same brand of tighty whities .
he didn't fiii them out quite as weii as you , though .
speciai effects .
hoilywood .
not aii me .
oh , i doubt that very seriously .
weil , then get him enthusiastic , damn it !
come on , get up .
how'd it go in there?
we aii set now?
oh , yeah , we're reai tight .
only the finest for you , superstar .
i was just playing .
i ain't gonna forget you , crewe .
hey , yo , you owe me money on that game , punk !
better watch yourself , mr. footbail !
bitch !
yeah , you better run , woman .
yo , footbail .
take a seat .
thanks .
you know , i have never seen one inmate just walk in here and be unanimously hated by the entire population .
i ain't never seen it .
how'd i get so iucky?
you could have robbed banks , sold crack , stole your grandmama's pension , and nobody would have cared .
but shaving points off a footbaii game?
man , that's just un american .
you play footbail?
me?
no .
i suck so bad , they used to pick me after the white kids .
used to be mad too .
it's iike , " i can't believe i picked a nigga that can't play .
caretaker .
paui crewe .
whatever your pleasure , i can facilitate .
you need weed , you need meth hey , you need prozac , i'm your man .
i know how you white boys always deai with that depression .
i mean , me personaily , i don't understand what you white boys aii depressed about .
hey , you're white .
smile .
and for a smaii fee , i can even get you mcdonald's .
reaily?
yeah , that's right .
mickey d's .
my man cheeseburger eddy got the hookup .
cheeseburger eddy?
that's right .
we can get our mcflurry on .
enjoy it , fat man .
what about the love of a beautifui woman?
weil , you're gonna have to iower your standards on the beautifui part and on the woman part .
hey .
let's just stick with the cheeseburgers .
oh , they ugly now , but in eight months , he gonna iook iike beyonc .
no , thanks .
now , here's the most important part .
you can't iet these guys scare you .
you can't iet them punk you .
because if you do that , you gonna end up being somebody's bitch .
don't want that .
thanks for the advice .
hey .
let me take that tray out for you .
i ain't done eating yet .
oh , you're not?
i'ii give it back to you , then .
you're dead !
hornet's nest !
everybody stay down .
stay quiet !
come on , crewe , get up .
get up , superstar .
yes , sir .
you think you can do anything you want around here , don't you?
weil , you are no different than any other piece of shit that cails this place home .
reaily?
these guys think you're a dumb redneck too?
girl , that's your new boo .
you better cut that shit out .
it's getting old .
that's gonna cost you .
looking forward to it .
wake up , sleeping beauty .
hey , superdick .
warden's wondering if your stay in the hotbox has changed your mind .
how iong have i been in here?
one week .
wanna go for two?
how'd you find these guys anyways?
recruitment , boy .
when coilege stars don't get drafted , they need a place to go .
a job , money , security .
who drank aii the damn gatorade? !
damn it !
and apparently steroids .
look , seems iike you got aii the talent you'd want .
so why do you need me?
weil , now , you might find this hard to believe , but there's folks here in the prison ieague don't care for me very much .
you , warden?
they thought it might be amusing to schedule the defending ieague champs as our first game .
and me?
weil , i thought an old pro iike yourself might have some training camp tricks , driils , insights to offer up .
give us the competitive edge .
aii right .
relatively simple .
you need a tune up game .
a tune up game?
yeah .
in coilege , we'd start every season against appalachian state or some slack division ii team .
kick the iiving shit out of them .
get their confidence up .
you know something , paul?
you've just given me an inspiration .
that's great .
what?
you're gonna assemble a team to play the first game against us .
and you , mr. crewe , are gonna be the quarterback .
i don't think so .
let me teii you something .
in my prison , to get along , you gotta go along .
i just wanna do my three years and be done .
three years is before you assaulted captain knauer .
now , you could be with us for a very iong time , mr. crewe .
fine , i'ii do it .
good choice .
but one condition , though .
gotta promise me to keep captain knauer off my back .
it's a deal .
now , you got four weeks to assemble a team and train them .
what , are we gonna have a half hour a day to practice with a nerf bail?
oh , i'ii make sure my boys ailow you sufficient freedom , within these wails , to get your team in shape .
what's this?
footbaii 'tree outs . " '
what the heii is a " tree out "?
tryout , " you half a meatbail .
what's this footbaii thing about , man?
crewe's getting a team together .
to play against who?
the guards .
now , i don't know about y'ail , but i occasionaily have the impulse to physicaily assault one of our finer correctionai officers .
yeah?
weil , how the heii we gonna get to do that?
just show up at the " tree outs , " you big , dumb bitch .
do the girls get to play?
we're playing footbails , not bails bails .
this is builshit .
just another chance for the guards to beat on us .
don't you idiots get it?
we could get a free shot at the guards .
this is our turn .
we could beat up on them .
we could kiii them .
kiii them .
you know mvp sold his own teammates out .
what do you think he's gonna do to you fools?
and that's the truth .
with some cheese on it .
there ain't no meat ioaf between these buns .
yo , man , that's my flier , man !
i worked hard on it !
you see?
he ran iike a iittle bitch , right?
you saw that , right?
yo , team needs you .

i've been right here , rotting .
waiting for a chance to get back at those sadistic guards .
waiting .
for this .
weil , coach , as you can see , we don't exactly have the cream of the crop to work with here .
weil , what are we gonna do?
how are we gonna find players?
how'd they get you to go to florida state?
they recruited me .
i'ii get the strippers .
well , now , lindsay , this isn't about credit or congratulations .
this is about giving men who've made mistakes in their iives an opportunity to rise above themselves .
to move beyond the bars of containment .

i had a parole date in '86 .

hazen has a rating system for every con .
what's three stars?
the more prone to violence that the inmate is , the more stars he gets .
five stars is the max .
