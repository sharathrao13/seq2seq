since when was your mother russian?
you are drunk .
listen ...
she is not your wife , don't talk to her like that , do you understand?
you are completely right .

you echoed from the heavens
like thunder .
we marched right behind you .

nobody listens to me .
the monkey is in the tank .
he's trained .

that one .
the skinny one?
you are getting on my nerves .
i could spank you .
just like your mother .
do i have to act as naturally as possible?
i didn't say that .
do you think i'm a fool?
you said so .
come on ...
don't be so sensitive .
to be honest , i don't know what to do !
wait ...
is this naturally enough?
hey ...

he looks very brave .
logically , he resembles me .
are you soldiers or ballerina's?
look at you !
camera !
where is the smoke?
never at the right time !
piss off !
to be honestly , he would go all the way through .
oh boy .
yes , but then again he's a great director .

ivan was hoping to find soni .
mircovic , where does that odd patient come from?
officially he is dead .

according to the yugoslavian embassy .
a man with the same name died in 1941 during the bombings on belgrado .
he was zoo keeper .
do you know ...
look what he drew for me .
if he was an indian , he would be called
man who surrendered .
he told me amazing things .
about being locked in a cellar all that time .
the communism was one huge cellar .
the whole planet is a cellar .
i want to go to portugal during the summer .
maybe he knows an underground highway .

the second world war ended 50 years ago .
and the germans won .
no , they lost .
what do you mean , lost?

isn't it?
yes , but these aren't the same germans .
you are a traitor !
what do you call me?
a traitor?
you shall see who is the traitor .
i didn't want to show you , but look for yourself .
