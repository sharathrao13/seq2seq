i don't give a damn if they belong to tom cruise .
control , vision , determination .
these are the three fundamental components ... of the new generation race car driver .
speed is a byproduct .
going fast .
the car is you , you are the car .
okay?
let's ride !
billy , you just shaved one second off your lap time !
tommy , i don't know what that was , but it wasn't driving .
go get 'em .
well , well , well .
what do you pay your pit crews with , oreos and gummi bears?
i folded , atley .
you know that .
what are you doing here?
is there someplace we can talk?
about what?
about your brother and the deep shit he's in .
frank .
would you watch the kids for a minute?
tell me about kip .
he took a job and he fumbled it .
now he's jammed up .
he's jammed up bad .
what kind of job?
a boost .
a big boost .
a boost .
what's kip doin 'on a boost?
oh , you're shittin 'me , man .
kip's become quite the little crew runner since you left .
you don't talk to your ma?
she neglected to mention it .
listen , i need somethin '.
i i need somethin 'cold to drink .
i thought we were goin 'someplace to talk .
who was the job for?
a new guy named raymond calitri .
they call him " the carpenter .
he's runnin 'all the dark ponies down there now .
it's a full on " devil came down to long beach " trip .
he's bad .
he's real bad .
and this calitri is the one who's after my brother?
like stains on a mattress .
and you should know , i work for him .
there weren't a lot of opportunities for retired car thieves on the gimp .
he put me to work .
but i gotta tell you , memphis , this guy , he scares the shit out of even me .
what are you doing , man?
stop !
stop !
atleyjackson .
right .
they have kip .
take me there .
raymond calitri , memphis raines .
i try to learn your ways , understand your obsessions .
but this baseball , it's so bleeding boring .
isn't it?
where's my brother?
memphis raines .
your legend precedes you .
atley tells me you're the best .
after you left , auto theft in the south bay area went down 47 percent .
where's my brother?
i'm proud of these .
straddle chair from the arts and crafts period .
mahogany table with cloud lift pattern .
black walnut wine table .
metal's cold , ugly .
wood's warm , clean .
provided by nature .
to see a piece of furniture take shape , it's like watching a child grow .
i asked you a question .
they threw us out england , threw us out of france , but here we are .
flourishing , really , except for the minor inconvenience of despising everything about your country .
on this list you'll fknd 50 cars fkve , zero .
i need all 50 delivered to long beach harbor , pier 1 4 , by 8 : 00 a . m . four days from now .
i'm paying $200, 000 .
i'm not interested .
i'm just here for my brother .
your kip came to me .
he had street cred .
the brother of the notorious memphis raines .
so two weeks ago i hired him and advanced him $1 0, 000 .
atley told me .
if it's about the advance , i can understand your anger .
a debt has to be settled .
ten grand , from me to you .
i wish it was that easy .
i don't see the complication .
i have four days to deliver 50 cars , and i have no cars .
well , that's another problem .
it is another problem , isn't it?
it's about me delivering 50 top end cars because i said i would ... because if i don't my south american friend goes somewhere else from now on .
and that's not good .
it's a humiliation .
because i'm the asshole who said i could deliver .
am i an asshole?
do i look like an asshole?
yeah .
i need that paper satisfked .
i'm retired .
now , where the hell is my brother?
i made this as well .
my fkrst one .
it takes 80, 000 pounds of pressure to crush a car .
kip?
who's that?
memphis .
oh , shit .
you okay?
shut it off ! .
turn it off ! .
you've got 30 seconds to consider your options .
shut it off ! .
you kill me , they kill you , your brother dies anyway .
you lie , you accept the job , you take your brother , you run .
i hunt you down , i kill you , i kill your brother ... and i kill your mother for the aggravation you've caused me .
you accept the deal , you steal some cars , you make some money ... and you be a big brother .
memphis !
8 : 00 a . m .
friday morning .
the cars are on the boat , or your brother's in the coffkn .
get me out of here !
somebody get me out of here !
listen , you don't really have to make me anything .
oh , hey , you come down here , you save my ass , it's the least i can do .
hey , i heard you were pumpin 'gas someplace up north or somethin ', right?
yeah , i'm workin 'with kids .

to make the friday 8 : 00 a . m . deadline you're gonna have to go old school .
a one night boost .
put all your nuts in one basket .
okay?
" one night "?
yes .
what , are you crazy?
one night .
no , i'm not crazy .
what , do you have , like , a better plan or something?
yeah .
you spread it out .
you play shadow games and shit .
we're on a truncated timetable .
otto , i'm sorry .
c can you just listen to me for one second?
all right?
we've heard you , kip .
shadow games .
but what you have to understand is that if you play shadow games ... by the second night the heat is onto you .
with a one night boost , by the time the fkrst car is reported stolen , your ship sets sail ; it's a surprise attack .
this is a complicated list , fellas .
it really is .
okay?
there are 25 that aren't a problem , but these exotics are tough to fknd .
and the new mercedes , they require laser cut keys .
okay?
uh , yeah , i got that covered .
you have that covered?
what'd i just say?
yeah , i got it covered .
yeah .
yeah .
all right , all right .
well , then , let's get to work .
toby , hack into the insurance database and fknd as many cars as you can .
yes !
i got addresses on hillary , natalie and tracy .
donny , check the dmv for the remaining cars on the list .
i'm sorry , miss , but you've missed fkve questions .
that's failing .
oh , no !
next .
no !
why?
you're supposed to go faster when somebody tailgates you !
ah .
hello again .
mm hmm .
here's your list of the 20 car owners 'names and addresses that you requested .
thank you .
that's $1 00 , please .

five dollars a car , 20 cars .
would you like a calculator?
it used to be two dollars a car .
thanks a lot .
that's all redesigned , right?
my name is roger , sir .
may i be of some help?
that's funny .
my name's roger .
two rogers don't make a right .
roger , i have a problem .
yes?
i've been in l. a. for three months now .
i have money , i have taste .
but i'm not on anybody's " a " list , and saturday night is the loneliest night of the week for me .
well , a ferrari would certainly change that .
perhaps , mmm .
but you know , this is the one .
yes , yes , yes .
i saw three of these parked outside the local starbucks this morning , which tells me only one thing there's too many self indulgent wieners in this city with too much bloody money !
now , if i was driving a 1 967 27 5 gtb four cam
you would not be a self indulgent wiener , sir .
you would be a connoisseur .
precisely .
champagne would fall from the heavens .
doors would open .
velvet ropes would part .
i don't have one here .
however , i do have one in the warehouse .
superb .
what else do you have in the warehouse?
mm hmm .
all right .
uh huh .
that was mr. lakewood from the dealership .
he says that boxer lookin 'punk is gonna pick up the keys to three new mercedes today .
same make and model as the ones we already got impounded .
now we talkin '.
the el spirito de graciela sails friday ... 8 : 00 a . m . sharp .

they'll just dump the cars .
no , we'll get them with the mercedes .
let's set up , uh , three surveillance teams at those addresses .
now , you go ahead and you make your move , man ... and i will be waiting for you .
