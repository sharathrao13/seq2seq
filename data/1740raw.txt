good evening , ladies and gentlemen .
and welcome to our little show .
tonight , we got ourselves ... ... a bona fide multiplicitous ... ... conglomeration of cubanos ... ... on this here stage tonight .
we got ... ... paquito d'rivera !
we got ignacio berroa !
and ... ... we got my newest ... ... cuban son ... ... arturo sandoval .
here by special permission of the cuban government .
i'd like to say something .
ever since i was a little boy and ... ... since the first time i heard his music ... ... i had a dream to be able to play with maestro dizzy gillespie .
so , to me right now , life is truly a dream .
mari , it's me , arturo .
arturo , where are you?
i'm in athens .
are you okay?
yes .
you're in london , this is it .
we're halfway there .
it's all arranged .
tonight?
i will be in italy tomorrow .
be careful .
i'll call you when i get there .
tell 'em none of that feta cheese .
got that?
un feta .
you got it .
don't go away .
arturo , what's going on?
quick , give me a cigarette .
my wife and son are in london .
they're where?
we're not going back .
it's not done yet .
it's okay .
don't worry .
we'll get you out .
arturo , man , let's go .
i called the embassy .
they're expecting us .
what's the matter?
i still got family there , diz .
when you leave , the government punishes those you leave behind and love .
then are you sure you want to do this?
i've been in jail all my life .
freedom's a scary thing , but ... ... i gotta get on the bird .
well , come on , let's do it .
the embassy's closed , sir .
you better get it open .
this is an international incident .
my cuban friend
sir , the embassy's closed .
not for me .
i'm dizzy gillespie .
open the gate , sergeant .
yes , sir .
it's an honor to meet you , we got your call .
you must be arturo sandoval .
that's the second greatest trumpet player in the world .
someone should be ....
there you are .
good evening , gentlemen .
i should say , good morning .
i'm michael tasker .
i'm a big fan , mr. gillespie .
thank you .
this is arturo
arturo sandoval , yes , petition for asylum .
how long's this gonna take?
red tape respects no boundaries .
that's an international fact of life .
if you'd like to  this is the american embassy .
i know you got some apple pie around here .
i think we can arrange something .
you be cool .
thank you , diz .
enjoy .
right this way .
your mr. gillespie is one of the few people ... ... who can open this place in the middle of the night .
have a seat and i'll be back in a moment .
thank you .
coffee?
thank you , yes .
i'm scared .
trust me .
i think i should explain ... ... there are certain criteria that must be met before we can grant asylum .
an individual must prove that he is unable to return ... ... to his homeland for fear of persecution .
i understand .
that's why i'm here .
you've been touring with mr. gillespie's united nation band .
are you here with your family?
no .
my wife and son are waiting for me in london .
you're seeking asylum for them as well?
yes .
is there a problem?
i just need some information .
okay .
so , you've been a musician for how many years?
since i was six years old .
i taught my cat how to walk on a tight rope while i played the bongos .
it was like an animal act .
and you were educated at a government run music school?
yes .
you were classically trained?
yes .
it says you were a member of the cuban music academy .
is that right?
yes .
is that a state sponsored organization?
yes .
your first professional job ....
what is that?
orquesta
cuban modern music orchestra .
government sponsored?
yes , of course .
if the government doesn't sponsor it , it doesn't exist .
maybe i'm missing something here , because it seems that on paper ... ... that the government treated you quite well .
they supported you as a musician .
yes .
yes , as long as i did what they wanted .
that's the shit !
that's what we should be playing .
i know !
start a band and get on the bird and fly !
you haven't changed .
what for?
you look good , very handsome .
even without the hair , very handsome .
what's this about?
nothing .
come on in , guys .
relax , please , sit down .
here , don't burn my couch .
jaime , why are we here?
what is this meeting about?
compaero somavilla brought a matter to my attention .
i just mentioned to jaime , that ... ... you want to start your own band .
you're own band .
it's a good idea .
it's a shame we just can't do it .
caballeros .
i'm an artist just like you are .
i understand the need to invoke the muse .
but as cubans , we have to present a united front .
politically and musically .
destroying the orquesta is not in our interests
no .
we do not want to destroy anything .
just the best band in cuba , that's all .
there's room for another great band in cuba .
normally i'd agree with you but we're living in times of scarcity now .
exactly .
besides ....
i just can't see why you can't play what you want in the orquesta .
in the orquesta , we play what you want us to play .
we need to experiment .
you don't want to experiment .
you just don't want to play our music .
you want to play their music .
the music of the enemy .
what is the music of the enemy?
that's enough !
our comrades are losing their lives in angola .
you guys are thinking about your little music .
just about yourselves !
there's no time for that .
there are limits !
there are limits !
leave the cowboys alone .
i never saw that picture before .
i don't care , this is dominoes .
pay attention to the game !
one more coffee , please .
wait , it's not your turn .
gracias , mama .
your coffee is like a wake up kiss in the morning .
cirita bonita , tan bella y sabrosita .
gracias .
tastes like the fourth time through on these grounds .
you boys wanna play?
maybe later , papi .
this is going nowhere .
you heard jaime?
they pull us out of venues .
they pull the equipment .
they won't ever do it .
we'll be so good they'll have to support us .
how are you gonna get 'em to support a jazz band?
never call it " jazz .
don't ever even use the word .
they'll know .
they'll hear it .
these guys , they're not musicians , they're bureaucrats .
you're cuban , i'm cuban .
chucho's cuban .
whatever we play is gonna be cuban music .
we'll need some kind of camouflage , you know?
congas .
big ones .
up front .
up front !
we called ourselves " irakere .
it's an african word meaning , " jungle .
we played jazz ... ... but we gave it our own swing .
wait a minute , excuse me .
they didn't stop you .
and this band was a success .
yes .
the camouflage we had worked .
you toured extensively .
you did a record for cbs .
you even won a grammy .
it seems like the government didn't care what you were playing .
they chose not to notice because we were making a lot of money for them .
i imagine you were making some money for yourself as well?
it doesn't work that way .
the clubs pay the ministry of culture directly .
all we got was meal money .
you know you can make a lot more money if you weren't in cuba .
it's not about the money .
it's about the music .
they let you play the kind of music that you wanted .
american jazz and gershwin and ellington
you're always taking a risk because in cuba you never know where the line is .
you can play gershwin once too often .
not being able to play gershwin does not constitute persecution .
it is if they decide it's counter revolutionary and you're put in jail .
in cuba you live with that fear every day .
someone might come to you , your house , your family ... ... and hurt you because of a song .
just a song .
and that is persecution .
if you felt that strongly about it ... ... why didn't you defect earlier?
i was about to .
i had it all planned out .
but you stayed .
let's go !
life has it's own plan .
let's go !
c'mon !
c'mon , let's go !
i'm here , let's go .
the bus is coming !
c'mon , what are you waiting for?
if you don't get this one , there won't be another bus for hours !
i'm with him .
c'mon !
i've been here all along , right here .
she's with me .
she's the love of my life .
by the way , what's your name?
marianela marianela
marianela
when she walks
all the buses have to stop
and when she laughs
she has to cry
what's wrong?
my mother just died ... ... a week ago .
i'm sorry .
did your mother have something against laughing?
where are you going?
this is my stop .
really?
mine , too .
what a coincidence .
i wanna see you before i go .
what's the point if you are leaving?
why does there have to be a point?
when does your tour finish?
in a month .
let's have dinner .
ask me when you get back .
that's too long , i need to see you before i go .
what's the hurry?
i'm afraid you might forget me .
that's very unlikely .
cuban mlnistry of commerce
excuse me , do you work here at the foreign trade ministry?
s .
don't tell me that you work here as well .
no .
i don't think so .
is there a problem?
no problem .
marianela marianela
marianela
i'm gonna see you before i go !

and she actually left .

both kids , the mother , the father , the grandmother , on a raft .
this is cuca we're talking about .
what happened to cuca?
they left a couple of weeks ago from cojimar at about 3 : 00 in the morning !
the whole family?
yes .
the whole family , even the dog .
the dog?
good thing she escaped .
she didn't escape .
she gave up .
she gave up because things got a little tough .
she wanted to go shopping in miami .
please , she bought everything she could in havana .
hello?
may i speak to marianela , please?
marianela , for you .
oigo?
marianela?
s .
arturo .

arturo sandoval .
you don't remember me?
of course i remember you .
it's been less than an hour .
listen , you like baseball?
do i like baseball?
what are you doing out here?
this is where i practice .
i like to come here 'cause the music ....
my playing comes back to me like a wave .
what were you playing?
something i just wrote .
what is it called?
marianela .
really .
put your hand on my heart .
right here .
nice .
nice .
what's her name?
marianela .
where does she live?
none of your business .
she was the waitress we were chasing around
you were chasing .
marianela works for the government .
the government?
you think i'm crazy?
i think you're in love and that's a dangerous place to be .
what are you talking about?
you know i wanna leave .
i can't take my family .
you're free .
you get on that plane , you never come back .
you get hooked , you're stuck .
don't complicate your life , hermano , okay?
there she is .
what do you think?
it's worse than i thought .
be careful .
you know how it works .
they get a spy to dress up like the woman of your dreams .
it must be quite a temptation for you .
what?
traveling to all those countries .
nice cars , nice clothes .
do you ever want to get off the plane and not come back?
you know , arturo ... ... you'd miss cuba .
you'd miss the way everything smells like sugar .
you'd miss the baseball .
you'd miss our music .
i'm still sitting here .
i don't understand why people leave cuba .
especially you , who's gotten so many things from the revolution .
marianela .
my talent comes from god , not fidel .
do i have " defector " written on my forehead?
what are we talking about here?
do you get this nervous on stage?
only at auditions .
how am i doing?
i'm still sitting here .
wait !
wait !
this is marianela !
when she walks , all the buses have to stop !
that was the last bus .
that was the only bus .
okay .
what are you gonna do?
i don't know .
i could stay at my friend's apartment .
i should call home .
it was a lovely day .
yes .
thank you .
you're welcome .
goodnight .
i'll walk you there .
come on .
no , it's okay
it's okay?
okay then , let's go .
come on .
i'll protect you .
i also was married .
it was a mistake .
the husband , not the son .
you have a son?
yes , he's eight .
eight?
i was very young .
very young .
she lives here?
it's not much further .

yes .
thank you for the walk .
goodnight .
mari .
are you really leaving tomorrow?
that's what i told you , yes .
will you promise me you won't come back?
i don't understand .
what are you saying?
promise me you won't come back and i'll be with you tonight .
why?
because ... ... i'm afraid i might fall in love with you .
it would never work .
we are too different .
different is good .
promise me this will be our only night .
i don't understand .
if i promise you , you'll be with me tonight?
i promise .
i'm serious .
promise me .

dizzy's atmosphere , dizzy gillespie .
charlie parker live at carnegie hall , 1947 .
side b , track two .
you know what i mean .
it's just music .
great music .
you're not supposed to listen to that station .
now we're safe .
it's not funny .
you could get in trouble .
believe me , i know .
i spent four months in military jail for listening to that .
i think i earned the right .
time to go .
you have your tour and i have my work .
what are you doing?
what are you doing?
memorizing your face .
oyeme !
are we going?
what?
tell me one thing .
can the colonel dance?
please .
do you love him?
ay , chica .
c'mon , let's go .
i'm here .

you promised you wouldn't come back .
the last promise i'll ever break to you .
she wasn't an informer?
of course not .
but she did work for the government?
yes .
she's still a member of the party?
yes .
she's an active member?
not anymore .
she sees things completely differently now .
that's convenient , now that you're seeking asylum .
convenient .
it seems that her politics didn't bother you .
i never said that .
we had many disagreements about politics .
you had disagreements?
you claim to be on opposite ends of the political spectrum .
how can two people that far apart stay together?
papi and leonel , this is arturo .
mucho gusto , seor sosa .
leonel .
say hello to arturo .
i'm sorry , i'll be back .
what's so great about him?
he's funny .

trumpet player .
trumpet player .
mr. trumpet player .
may i know what are your intentions with my daughter?
i want to marry her .
i want to have a son with her and live with her for the rest of my life .
she never mentioned that to me .
i haven't asked her yet .
seor sosa , with all due respect ... ... i know when you look at me , what you're thinking .
i'm a musician , she's your daughter
i suppose you would like to move into my house .
yes , for a little bit .
i have something for you .
it's soap from london .
you keep it .
you know flix chapotn?
of course .
i was admiring your taste in music .
now , he was a trumpet player .
you like baseball?
maybe we can go see my favorite team , los industriales .
you're trying to make me like you .
how am i doing?
not good?
let's try a bribe .
sandwich?
no?
it's turkey .
turkey sandwich .
when's the last time you had a turkey sandwich?
never .
where do you get it?
right there .
that's not turkey .
what is it?
that's vulture .
vulture?
no , it's not .
it's turkey from heaven .
bad news .
you know him?
who doesn't know him?
is he in the party?
i don't think he's in anything .
he belongs to a different world .
different way of thinking .
i don't understand you and neither will anybody else .
you have a good position here , a wonderful reputation .
why do you want to risk it?
i'm old enough to know what i'm doing .
not as old as his first wife .
you know his first wife?
alba marina .
alba marina , the singer?
honey , what else don't you know about the man you're gonna marry?
we hear what they want us to hear .
we play what they want us to play .
you know what we're missing?
miles davis .
charles mingus , maynard ferguson .
while the rest of the world is painting rainbows , we paint in one color .
me?
i'm getting outta here .
what about your family?
i'll get them out somehow .
look .
i'm sick and tired of playing these fucking games !
be careful .
everybody in cuba has an ear and not only for music .
where have you been?
what is it?
somebody's following me .
what?
somebody's following me .
he was not supposed to be following you .
wait ....
you know him?
he's a friend of emilia's .
he was only supposed to ask around .
he's been looking for things .
what?
about you .
about me?
why?
because i asked him to .
you asked him?
yes .
if you want to know something about me , why don't you ask me?
because i don't know if i can trust you .
you don't trust me?
i've told you everything .
that's not true .
you never told me about alba marina .
i told you i was married !
not to alba marina .
what difference does it make?
do you have any doubts that i love you?
listen , arturo .
i had one husband walk out on me .
he walked out on you and your son .
yes , and i won't go through that again !
don't compare me to him !
go home .
you all right?
you're not gonna have a heart attack , are you?
you scared the hell out of me .
i'm better now .
stop following me .
i'm not coming around here no more .
you were such a nice couple .
thanks .
you gonna make it home okay?
can't go home .
why?
because my wife kicked me out .

we have the most talented taxi drivers in the world !
how did you find me?
the doctor brought me .
the shawl is beautiful .
you should have asked me about alba .
i came here  i'm not finished .
arturo  i'm not finished .
what do you want to say?
i don't know .
what i feel about you ... ... i've never felt it before .
i don't know how to feel it .
i don't trust it .
what if i told you that i love you?
just because i love you .
no reason , i just love you .
i loved you the first time i saw you .
you're here with me now and i love you .
i love you .
you could send 100 guys to follow me .
all they'll ever find out is that i love you .
i love you .

he's better than the best .
i'm not this good .
bury it .
that's the wrong size tire .
it's round .
how you doing?
welcome to cuba , mr. gillespie .
welcome to the beautiful havana .
mr. gillespie , first thing we're gonna do , we're gonna tour ... ... one of our internationally renowned health care facilities .
thank you , but my health don't need caring .
can you take me to chano pozo's crib?
chano pozo's crib?
you don't know who chano is?
i know who chano is !
this has nothing to do with you .
no , hold on a second .
can you take me to his crib?
his crib?
yes , of course .
mr. gillespie , we have a tour .
we have the entire day planned out for you .
that's okay , thank you very much .
my boys'll go on the tour with you .
go with 'em , enjoy yourselves .
it's a real honor .
what is this?
it's my car .
keep telling yourself that .
yes , sir .
watch yourself there .
okay , here we go .
okay , here we go .
it's okay , thank you .
you sure you know who chano pozo is?
mr. gillespie , luciano pozo y gonzlez .
better known as " chano .
cuban conga player you met in 1946 .
chano's from belen , which is just up the street here .
dizzy gillespie and chano pozo added a whole new polyrhythmic structure to jazz .
you read the liner notes .
i've read everything to be read about  i gotta tell you something .
your car smells funny .
gasoline .
gasoline and tar .
i painted it with gasoline and tar .
gasoline and tar?
you're supposed to put the car on the road , not the road on the car .
understand what i'm saying?
anti imperialists
revolutlon
is there a statue or something?
statue?
no , there's no statue , diz .
then take me to chano pozo street .
street?
no , there's no street .
what do they got?
they don't got anything .
how do people remember him?
most people don't remember him .
that's criminal , man .
one of the greatest players that ever played .
chano pozo transcended the vicissitudes of the contingent world ... ... and moved in an odyssey into the realm of the metaphysical .
i'll betcha karl marx got himself a statue .
a statue and a theater , too .
karl marx can kiss chano pozo's ass .
you hear it?
that's the sound , diz .
chano pozo learned how to play the conga right in this neighborhood .
what's this , a show or something?
it's actually a party .
it's here every afternoon .
we'll stop here .
you can shoot as much as you want .
this is chano's world .
this is the real thing .
they're doing a traditional yamboo .
dedicated to the city of belen , where chano's from .
you all kept it alive , man .
when they dragged us over to america , they took our drums ... ... our religion , our language .
we had to learn theirs .
but the true african heart's still beating here in cuba .
i mean it is what it was .
there's more .
a lot more .
that reminds me , they're putting together some sort of jam session for me tonight .
you ever heard of this band called irakere?
irakere?
i heard of 'em .
you're about to hear the best musicians in cuba .
like , paquito d'rivera .
i like the sound of that .
gracias .
what the hell's my driver doing playing a trumpet?
your driver?
gimme my horn .
the african and the cuban ... ... transmogrified on the great ethereal plane .
i smuggled this thing in from frankfurt .
the government here , they don't support jazz .
as soon as you get on that boat tomorrow , the so called " jazz festival " is over .
musica non grata .
musica non grata .
that show tonight was just for you .
it's not like that every day .
this your stuff?
i didn't hear any of this tonight .
just some stuff i'm working on .
that's nice .
musica non grata .
you know ... ... miles davis came to me for a trumpet lesson once .
i said , " let's go to the piano .
i don't play no piano .
i told him , " the only way you can really get inside the music ...
... arranging , composition , is with the piano .
you learn it , then we can better understand each other .
why don't you come on tour with me?
me , come with you?
that horn i heard tonight doesn't belong to you .
it belongs to the whole world .
boat leaves maana .
tomorrow?
i wish , diz .
i wish .
you don't understand .
dizzy gillespie saw something in me .
in me .
so now you want to go away with him?
i don't know what you want anymore .
you are already in a band .
you tour , you're famous .
i'm on display .
i am in a cage .
don't be ridiculous .
i'm in a sanctioned band , playing sanctioned songs .
we're going on tour next week and i don't even feel like going .
the music that i played tonight , that's what i need to be playing .
don't you want that?
of course i do .
you know that i've always supported you .
we're a family .
there are limits .
limits?
who am i talking to here?
i don't see why you have to complicate things .
look at this .
ten thousand cubans have stormed into the peruvian embassy ... ... in a desperate attempt to flee the island .
the castro regime is waging a crackdown on descent after a chaotic 48 hours ... ... that began when a havana bus driver seeking asylum ... ... for himself and his passengers , crashed through the embassy gates ... ... prompting a cross fire that left one guard dead .
in retaliation for the embassy's refusal to turn over the gate crashers ... ... the cuban government removed its guard ... ... triggering a stampede of refuge seeking cubans .
i left my sax on the plane .
you forgot your sax?
watch this for me , okay?
okay .
hurry up , the plane's gonna leave soon .
why did we cancel the tour?
we canceled the tour to protect irakere's reputation and yours .
this is osvaldo , our compaero from state security who attends to us .
i'll call you later .
sit down .
as i was saying , irakere is a very important voice of this revolution .
so is your voice .
and so was paquito's .
and he betrayed us .
and now , with paquito gone ... ... we think you should play a more prominent role in irakere .
you know i appreciate that , jaime , but ... ... i got some other plans .
you got some other plans?
i want to start my own band .
i want to do some fusion , i want to expand the whole concept of cuban music .
i want to bring it to a new international level .
your own band?
yes , my own band .
all right everybody ready at 5 : 00 for sound check .
it's out of my hands .
you can't play here .
i have been to every club in this town .
i cannot get a gig .
word on the inside is you're on the outside , that's what they say .
angel , this is your club , your rules .
you love this music , but what?
i'm your friend .
it would make things a lot easier if you just joined the party .
very simple .
what?
listen !
you don't have to believe it , just sign .
no .
you wanna play the horn , right?
you gotta play the game !
partner , you watching?
go sit down and play with your father .
i can't .
i gotta go .
why can't you stay longer?
marianela , let's go .
vmonos .
you never want to play .
he never wants to play .
come on , play .
sit down , you got time .
maybe you win .
marianela , let's go !
i'm coming !
weren't you a friend of paquito d'rivera?
i'm still a friend .
really?
even after he defected?
paquito turned his back on our country .
to me , he's a traitor .
he made a choice .
he turned his back and he had it all .
if he had it all , he wouldn't have left .
he's just another worm .
a worm?
just like the 100, 000 that are leaving from the port of mariel by boats?
i guess they got tired of having it all , too .
how can you say that?
are you listening to your son?
i think we should play .
it's my turn .
marianela , let's go !
talk to me .
you lose your temper every time we go there .
you can't even sit down and play dominoes with your father .
'cause i can't watch it anymore .
he likes to play .
what's wrong with that?
he's throwing his life away .
my father used to be a great mechanic , and they came and took his garage away !
why do you think i bought that car?
i bought it for him , to get him away from that goddamn table !
keep your voice down .
what are you afraid of?
the revolution?
remember , it gives us everything .
they didn't take your father's garage .
he gave it up .
they nationalized it !
they took away what he believed in !
they took away his dream , his love , his trade !
the thing that he did !
we all make sacrifices .
for what?
for what?
for the country !
for an idea !
free hospitals , free education .
of course .
and by the way , those 100, 000 people running away at mariel , they are giving up .
giving up?
yes !
that is exactly what they are not doing !
by the way , what good is free education if you can't read and say what you want?
what good are eyes if everybody's blind?
i've never heard your father complain !
not to you .
or you .
your father supports this revolution .
because that's all he's got left !
if he denounces it now , what does he have?
if he denounces fidel , his entire life would be meaningless !
he would have given up everything for a fucking lie !
turi is sleeping !
the whole neighborhood is sleeping !
the whole country is sleeping !
my kids will have to wake up !
my kids will not sleep through this !
let's go , wake up , right now !
they can hear you down the street .
let 'em report me to the committee of the defense of the revolution !
the sandoval family will not sleep through this !
are you listening?
let's go , time to wake up !
nobody's sleeping in here !
let's go !
you gonna sleep all day?
what do you want?
you can play .
business has been bad , and you bring in the customers , so
how many nights?
we'll see how it goes .
one , two .
one , two , three , four .
okay?
like that .
one , two .
one , two , three , four .
what's the matter , you forget how to play the trumpet?
no !
johnny !
what happened?
they kick both of you out of london?
hello , darling .
good to see you .
you couldn't come to our club , so we came to you .
we had dizzy back at the club last week .
he couldn't stop talking about ... ... his cuban compadre .
he's an honorary cuban now .
he has a special respect for you .
and he agrees with me .
you gotta be somewhere where your talents are truly respected .
not so loud .
i just want to hear the end of it .
turi , off to bed .
it's late .
s .
you should see this on ochoa .
come .
this is general ochoa .
led the troops in angola , fidel proclaimed him the hero of the revolution .
now he has him on trial .
what's his crime?
he got too popular .
you see , in cuba there could only be one hero of the revolution .
unless , you're dead and then you can be as popular as you want .
don't let arturo brainwash you .
ochoa is only accused of drug trafficking .
mari's the only person in the country who believes he did it without fidel's blessing .
i don't even think he did it and i'm not the only one .
we have a judicial process here .
he will be exonerated .
exonerated?
it's a fair trial .
you've been watching this trial for a week and it's not a fair trial , it's a farce !
he will end up in the firing squad .
he will never execute ochoa .
it's already been fixed .
his lawyer has begged the judge to execute him .
his defense attorney has turned into his prosecutor .
you call that a fair trial?
i'm so sorry .
i just wanted tonight to be perfect .
darling .
i've never had a dinner party without a fight .
usually , i'm the one who starts them .
i don't know what he wants .
he's so ... ... unhappy .
of course he is , he's a musician .
i've been around them for 40 years .
you know , in all that time i've never seen another one like arturo .
i'd like to dedicate this show tonight to my main man ... ... my inspiration , mr. dizzy gillespie .
i'd like to play a tune entitled , blues for diz .
sorry , i'm late .
this is paloma .
i'm glad you could come .
i wouldn't miss it .
johnny and sally , our friends from london .
mari , you have to know something .
people are watching .
there have been reports about him , about both of you .
what are you talking about?
they're gonna shut him down .
they won't let him play after tonight .
great show .
you know that if it was up to me , you could play here every night .
you know that .
you were wonderful .
wait .
why do you think the cuban government is so afraid of your music?
they're not afraid of my music , they're afraid of ideas .
come on , fidel castro is afraid of your ideas?
fidel castro is afraid of any idea that's not his .
you know how he overthrew batista?
it was a popular revolution .
it was a popular idea , it was a great idea .
restoration of a constitution , democracy , freedom from a dictatorship .
he did it with 80 people and 50 guns .
and a boat that nearly sank because of a running toilet .
that can't be all they had .
that's all he needed because the idea gave him the strength of an army .
the reason i've come here is to see if maybe i could talk about arturo .
so he could be allowed to play his music .
it's not entirely an issue of music .
i'm sorry?
and it isn't entirely about arturo .
you were also seen entertaining foreigners in your home .
are you questioning my loyalty?
there is a pattern of counter revolutionary behavior .
with all due respect , what revolution are you talking about?
is there some confusion?
apparently .
my revolution doesn't sound anything like your revolution .
mine is not about informing on your neighbors .
it's about creating a new society .
genuine equality , remember?
a place where our children can thrive .
i'm sure you will agree that no country loves its children more than cuba .
until they grow up .
compaera .
i know you love your husband , but don't say something you may regret later .
the revolution needs everyone's support to survive .
excuse me for saying this ... ... but if the revolution can't survive ... ... two people from england having dinner at my house ... ... or a cuban man playing the music he loves ... ... why bother trying to save it?
they're showing this all day long .
what's the verdict?
what do you think?
he already shot him .
where did he go?
at any cost
were you there that day when fidel marched into havana?
i was there .
i was a child .
and i saw him riding in that jeep .
that beard , that smile .
he was like a saint .
and i fell in love .
i fell in love with fidel , i fell in love with his dream .
it was going to be paradise .
i didn't know .
i didn't know they would stop you from playing your music .
my wife got her heart broken .
it's like finding out that your lover had been cheating on you all this time .
and it was over for her .
just so i understand ... ... what you're saying is you never sympathized with the castro regime .
please , i mean no disrespect , take a piece of pencil and write this down .
i have never ever , sympathized with fidel castro .
he betrayed the idea , he broke every promise he ever made .
please , just write that down .
this is from the london tlmes earlier this year .
you're quoted as making favorable statements about the castro regime .
this is from a german newspaper , frankfurt , i think .
the revolution gave me everything i needed .
is that an accurate quote?
i said it in frankfurt , in stockholm and in havana .
i had to say what i had to say .
i had to play the game .
you have to understand how that looks .
you come in here with an american icon
everyone in havana , every single person in havana ... ... has to have a double face in order to survive !
you must understand , you have to play the game .
i plead with you .
my wife and my son are waiting for me .
my son is in london waiting for me !
this was intercepted by the u. s. interest section in havana six months ago .
it confirms your membership in the communist party ... ... and your acceptance of all its principles .
are you a member?
are you a member of the communist party?
thank you .
if you enjoy my music and the way i play ... ... it's because the revolution has given me the opportunity .
thank you and goodnight .
it's not gonna work out .
yes , we're so close , don't say that .
he won't go for it .
he will .
just do what you have been doing .
give the government credit for everything .
even the air that i breathe .
a personal gift from fidel .
i thought you only got nervous for auditions .
what do you think this is?
mi socio , all the bookings have been arranged .
have a good trip .
be careful with the women over there .
i need a favor .
a favor?
i was hoping that my family can join me on this tour .
i've been on tour three times this year .
it's too much time away .
let me be honest with you .
it's the united nation band .
paquito , ignacio , two defectors .
we're concerned that you're going to be playing with two counter revolutionaries .
it's not gonna be a problem .
are you sure?
no problem .
are you willing to denounce paquito?
no .
if a foreign reporter asks you how you feel about paquito , what would you say?
i would say we share the same stage but not the same views .
good .
had you denounced him , i would've known there was something wrong .
come over here .
i'll see what i can do .
i'm going to try my best .
okay , my friend?
we can't tell anybody about our plans , not even our parents .
it's for their own protection .
when i leave , it has to be like any other trip .
no crying , no problem .
we just leave , okay?
you can't pack too much because you'll call attention to yourself .
but i've got to bring so many things .
i have to pack for you , leonel and turi .
thank god emilia gave me that suitcase .
they didn't authorize leonel's visa .
he's of military age .
but we got permission .
you said we got permission .
we did , but not leonel .
i just found out .
he's my son , they have to let him go with us .
he is forbidden to travel , no exceptions .
we can't leave him behind .
we'll find a way to bring him .
how?
paquito was going to bring his family and they're still here .
we said we'd go as a family .
i swear to you , i tried , but there's no exceptions .
he's on call for seven years .
seven years .
we will wait , that's not so long .
turi's gonna be military age , that's another seven years .
if we don't go now , none of us will ever get out .
you want me to leave my son?
he's my son too , you know .
then how could you think about leaving him?
you go .
listen to me .
you know i'm not gonna go without you , anywhere .
i won't leave my boy .
he's not a boy anymore .
he's my son .
listen to me .
no matter how long it takes ... ... even if i have to take a boat back ... ... i will get leonel and bring him back to us , i promise you .
he will be with us .
we have to be strong .
look at me !
we have to be strong .
we have to make the first move or else we're never gonna get our family out .
come on , trust me .
come here .
let me help you with that .
i got it .
come on , it's my job now .
i got it .
nice taxi , doctor .
thank you .
i have realized my full potential .
i wanna go with you , papi .
i know , turi .
i'm gonna see you in london in two weeks , okay?
you take care of mommy .
take care of yourself .
be careful .
thank you .
for what?
for teaching me how to play dominoes .
you still got a lot more to learn .
take good care of the car .
don't bury it .
i'll see you soon .
i'm scared .
trust me .
take care of mommy , okay?
and bring her to london .
we'll be there in two weeks .
i don't want to make a scene in front of my mother ... ... but i don't want to pretend like i respect you .
you don't have all the information .
i used to think that you were something .
the way you never backed down .
you're just like the rest of 'em .
i'm so sorry you feel that way .
sorry?
don't feel sorry for me , be sorry for turi .
because all you ever do is teach him how to sell out .
you're still not packed?
i don't know , papi .
i don't know what i will need .
i saw your mommy last night .
no , in a dream .
pap no est loco .
how is she?
she's worried , mi nia .
she said to me , " sosa , our daughter is leaving ...
... and you must do everything in your power to help her .
mi nia , mi amor .
quite a dream .
i tried ....
i tried to tell you  don't .
in my old age ... ... nothing will give me greater peace than to know that you are safe .
and happy .
mi cielo , wherever you are ... ... we'll always be together .
come here .
you know i love you .
i love you , too .
don't worry , i'll take care of him .
it's only gonna be a month , okay?
take care of yourself .
you make a very compelling case .
but i have to be honest with you .
i don't think this is going to be easy .
maybe i could try to explain better .
you did explain to me .
but this application is going to be reviewed in d. c.
on paper it appears that you benefited from the system ... ... and that your motives are financial .
that's just not true .
the burden of proof is on you , you see and on paper
change the paper .
excuse me?
you tell'em .
please .
i will make my recommendations .
i will start the process , but
how long is the process?
it's hard to tell .
it could be a week , a month .
there's no way of knowing .
what am i supposed to do?
do you realize how hard it was to get my family out of cuba?
do you know how long we've planned this?
we are completely exposed .
you must find a way of protecting us .
the law states you must be in immediate and observable danger
they shot two defectors in london two months
i can't offer official protection .
you must understand .
my wife and son are by themselves .
listen to me .
no one will know you were here .
you just continue the tour as if nothing happened .
i can't go back .
it's not up to me .
there's nothing else i can do .
i'll tell mr. gillespie that you're waiting .
what am i supposed to do?
just do what the man says .
go on the tour and be cool , baby , we'll work it out .
we gotta go , come on .
hold on !
damnit !
they hung up .
listen , i've been through this , okay?
ten feet , but you're not gonna get there if you don't move .
we intercepted this from the u. s. interest section .
arturo sandoval .
what's this?
johnny , line two , it's havana .
hello?
what?
something's up .
they know marianela's in london .
they're asking questions .
slow down .
listen to me , they're gonna find out and take her back to cuba .
that ain't gonna happen .
i gotta go now , man , i gotta defect right now .
take it easy .
one in there from the white house .
you gonna call the president?
vice president , met him on air force one .
the cat said if i need anything , give him a call .
play the gig tonight , and then you'll be on the plane .
wait for me !
if you get through to the embassy , tell them it won't take us too long .
you're mrs. sandoval?
yes .
come with me , quickly .
these are your documents , all in order .
when you get to new york just stay on the plane .
this man from the state department will meet you on the plane .
do not get off the plane with anybody else .
what about my husband?
i'm sorry , we haven't heard anything yet .
you really don't know what this is all about .
they defected?
it's up to you to bring them home where they belong .
there's nothing that i can say that could ever bring them back .
please , come with us .
