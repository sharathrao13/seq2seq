i'm attached to a multi jurisdictional ,
federal task force on organised crime , and my code name is wishbone .

i'll have you both investigated and suspended !
technically , this is traffic duty .
technically , you're a goddamn idiot .
get out of here , taggart !

jesus christ ...
are you sure you got super glue?
yeah .
this is wild kingdom .
i tried to create a stress free environment .

these are my friends .
that's sidney .
he's a wandering jew .
this is mona .
hi , baby .
they actually like different kinds of music .
lf i play the beatles , the begonias perk up .
lf i play beethoven , they wither .
the ferns like the boston pops .
but everybody loves mozart .
who's this?
big al .
had him about six years .
lsn't he great?
what music does he like?
james brown .
drives him nuts .
ls that turtle shit in there?

i was with marcy trying to get the seats back ...
you can't do freaky shit in that car .
you have to do something for me .
something you don't want to do .
am i going to get in trouble?
you see that?
weird .
it's not weird .
it's simple .
the fumes from the super glue attach to the acid from the fingerprints .
it's a street cop trick .
hasn't filtered down to you boys yet .
now we have to match it .
we could use the computer downtown .
there won't be anybody there this time of night , sarge .
shit .
there goes my medical insurance .
you can be such a pussy sometimes .
really .
let's go .
come on .
you boys definitely get an a in high tech .
it takes 60 cops to do this shit in detroit .
charles cain .
used to be charles campos .
i just met this guy .
he works in the beverly hills gun club .
he does?
this ain't the guy , he's a weasel .
this isn't a master criminal .
that's his print .
this guy had nothing to do with bogomil getting shot .
lf he suspected him , he would've picked him up .
let's put an apb out on cain .
we can't .
all we got is fingerprints .
we need something else .
what do we do now?
let's go to the gun club .
wait .
it's 1 1 : 00 .
the gun club's closed .
so?
so?
this is a big mistake .
a big mistake .
it's against the law .
once we cross the line , there's no way back .
i'll go .
i'll go .
see?
would you lighten up and take some risks?
fuck it .
let's go .
shit .
alarm tape .
there are ways around alarm tape .
lf we open this door , the connection will break between the magnets .
lf we use this foil , and you squeeze it between the two magnets , then take your gum to hold it in place ...
now the magnets have the illusion that the connection's not broken .
then we take our knife ...
open the door without ...
we walk in without the alarm going off .
you've done that before .
i wasn't always a police officer , i fractured a law or two as a kid .
can i have a piece?
it's my last one .
split it .
none for you .
what are we looking for?
a needle in a haystack .
give me some light over here .
shit .
here you go .
what the hell is that?
that knife .
it's mine .
home protection .
billy , we got to talk .
did you get it?
yeah .
what is that?
a needle in a haystack .
map coordinates?
ls this lnspector todd of the detroit police?
it is .
i'm sorry to be bothering you , my name is lionel hand ,
i'm with the fbl enforcement bulletin .
i read it all the time .

we're proud of it .

come on , come on ...
damn it , who tricked my ass?
440 ...
don't confuse me when i'm dialling .
this is todd .
lnspector todd?
that's what i said .
this is harold lutz .
i'm chief of the beverly hills police department .
do you have an officer axel foley ...
yes , he's under my command , but he's assigned to some multi jurisdictional , federal task force .
i never know where the hell he is .
it's a real pain .
i can't control him .
he reports directly to the feds .
i have to go .
what the hell are you doing in here?
this is not my office .
you damn right it isn't .
i want to see if these coordinates intercept .
what makes you think they mean anything?

i get $10 for cars , i get $20 for limos .
what the hell is this?
my truck .

let me call you back .
i'm here to clean the pool .

during some wild party , somebody shit in the pool .
i'm here to clean it up .

i ain't happy , but it's my job .
you write names down , i clean pools .
where's the pool at?
who are these gentlemen with you?
the board of health .
they're making sure i do the job thoroughly .
lf you like , i can bring it by and you can verify it afterwards .
no , that's fine .
excuse me .
jesus christ !
wake up !
this is what we always talked about .
look alive .
you may never see it again .
i don't want to step on your tongues .
why aren't my parties like this?
you got to die sometime .
might as well be here .
what are we doing?
whoever took that truck is here .
how are we supposed to find them?
follow your dick .
that's the girl from the gun club .
with dent and thomopolis?
the big bitch .
max !
how'd you get in here?
forget i asked .
i see how , it's the suit .
nice suit , max .
this person is annoying us .
may i see your invitation?
i haven't begun to annoy you .
what's going on?
it's max .
check your guest list cos max ain't supposed to be here .
are we having a problem?
hef !
hugh hefner !
axel foley !
i feel like i know you already cos i put your magazine up ...
forget it .
here's some background on your guests .
this is thomopolis , he's into guns and drugs .
and this is max , and max kills cops for a living .
i don't know him or you .
i think it's time all of you left .
i happen to be a major contributor .
we appreciate it .
goodbye .
he appreciates it , max , but take your ass home .
you outdone your welcome .
but it's been real , it's been nice .
everybody , party's over !
max fucked it up for everybody , so let's just go home .
we'll go ahead as planned .
get cain to prepare e.
you picked dent's pocket?
i told y'all i wasn't always a cop .
yeah , you fractured an occasional law as a kid .
this is not good .
this is not good .
see?
every now and then , an occasional long shot pays off .
dent's accountant , sidney bernstein .
anything dent's into , he'll have a record .
we'll visit him tomorrow .
it's all we got to go on .
there's no b and d , i'm looking for something .
and what about that cement truck?
what about that , rosewood?
talk to me !
i have a theory on that .
the cement truck was a tactical decoy .
a decoy?
a diversion to protect the criminals 'getaway .
that's why it rammed the police car .
have you submitted yourself for drug testing yet?
i want you in by thursday .
understand?
are you aware that whoever was in that truck foiled the goddamn crime?
do you?
putz .
did you say something?
he called you putz .
no , i called you a putz .
he's right .
putz .
and you .
you , mr scribbler ...
what the hell were you doing there , foley?
aren't i a police officer , too?
remains to be seen .
did you call lnspector todd for me?
yes .
he doesn't like you very much .
do you hear this insubordination?
yes , and i've never heard such abuse .
whatever's happened , the fact remains that the robbery was foiled and the money was saved .
lf i were you , i'd concentrate on cracking this code and determining where the e crime will be .
there's not many targets beginning with e , so find them .
i will , ted .
mayor !
yes , mayor .
and you !
i want you out of here !
get out of here , you degenerate !
you're not even part of this department !
ls this a black thing?
out .
aren't you leaving for detroit?
today at noon .
you're not going to make it .
you're going to get fired .
we started this together , we'll finish together .
check if bernstein owns a car .
give me a pen .
give me a pen !
'86 mercedes .
license number crl 507 .
naturally , i can see ...
i mean , i understand .
somebody ...
wait ...
come right in !
don't let the fact that my door's closed dissuade you from entering my office .
beverly hills police .
are you mr sidney bernstein?
lucky guess .
you have 25 unpaid tickets .
we have a warrant for your arrest .
25?
what 25?
you have 25 unpaid parking tickets .
i pay all my tickets .
do you own a black mercedes benz , license plate number crl 507?
507?
that's my wife's car .
you have 25 tickets .
it's under my name , but it's my wife's car !
no , no , no !
bitch !
these tickets haven't been paid .
can you cuff mr bernstein?
there are people out there with chainsaws !
you have unpaid tickets and it's your car .
we're taking you in .
wait .
i've got an idea . ls there something that i have in this office that i could hand to you and that would make you kind of forget that you're holding those little pink tickets there?
what are you saying?
you'd have something in that hand and this hand you'd forget about .
that hand you'd go , " what did i have there?
i don't remember .
you mean if i had ... .. $200 in this hand?
ouch !
let go of my arm . $200?
ouch !
please , i'm robbing you .
that's what i'm doing .
here's one , here's two .
they're real crisp .
i have to use your computer to wipe all evidence of this transaction out .
no problem .
no problem at all .
thank you , sidney , so much .
certainly .
certainly .
also , one other thing .
i'm sure you understand my contact at headquarters wouldn't want his name to be known .
don't i know it .
could you excuse me while i ...
yeah , it's secretive .
it's like a james bond thing !
yes , yes .
thank you .
no problem !
no problem at all .
anything you want to use .
i can't believe ...
i don't want to hear it , billy .
jan , axel .
how you doing?
what do you got?
strange .
before 1978 , everything's blank .
it's classified , but its policy date is 197 4 .
i found something interesting in our foreign office in london .
dent was the cultural attach to the east german embassy in honduras .
he's got a racetrack , shooting club , drilling rig companies , an oil company .
oil company?
that's his biggest business .
but from these records , seems like dent's in trouble .
he's let his insurance lapse on everything in the last six months .
dent petroleum , even the shooting club .
all his businesses except one .
which one is that?
the racetrack .
empyrean fields .
he's got a huge policy on that one .
good , good , good , good , good .
ok .
great .
when your father wakes up ...
he's better .
he's up and around .
tell him you found his man .
bye bye .
empyrean fields .
rip off his own racetrack?
yes , if it's insured .
what was in the files?
we won't find oil field equipment
if we find dent .
lf we find him?
dent's visa application had today's date on it .
lf we don't step on it , he's gone .
i don't know what happened on the city deposit , max .
and the foley hit?
i don't know .
that's why i need you to go along personally to make certain nothing goes wrong .
i'm on the team , of course .
i broke it .
you son of a bitch .
you beat the computer?
what's it say?
" chinguen sus puercos , carlos .
screw you cops .
signed , carlos .
" puercos " ain't cops .
pigs .
another word for cops .
wait a minute , carlos?
it is cain .
charles cain .
carlos is spanish for charles .
cain changed his name .
he didn't want to grow up to be poor .
cain is the alphabet robber?
i ain't said that .
the first code was very hard .
this is easy .
whoever did this wanted the cops to get it .
you ran numbers?
i wasn't always a cop .
he fractured an occasional law .
the horses have now reached the starting gate .
freeze !
hit the floor !
freeze , goddamn it !
1 : 30 .
1 : 15 .
30 seconds .
time !
goodbye , mr cain .
.. winning it by a nose .
general was second and marshall's madness came third .
our horse didn't come in .
cain's did .
the result is now official .
the winner , johnny's dilemma ...
police officers !
police !
we're a little late .
all i can tell you now is that we are confident that we have identified the alphabet bandit .
the man was shot dead at the scene this morning by security guard jack stiles .
ln his latest robbery attempt , the man was fatally wounded .
so i give you my oath right here there will be no f crime .
my computer team cracked the alphabet bandit's code this afternoon .
all of the notes , mind you , were signed " carlos " , right?
carlos , which , as you all know , is spanish for charles .
do you hear what i'm saying?
lf it's cain , where's the money?
where's dent?
you said shipping oil equipment .
but how?
where?
let's put an apb out on dent .
for what reason?
where'd you get that?
what?
it's coming from there .
excuse me .
how did the mud get on the horse?
he was grazing in the pasture .
where's the pasture at?
there .
dent's oil field .
bogomil had that red mud on his sneakers .
maybe he got a tip , he came here and they tried to waste him .
who pulled the alphabet jobs?
dent's going broke , ok?
so he heists some bank , heists some jewellery , then throws this easy code with cain's name on it .
simple .
you frame cain , kill cain ,
cain's the alphabet killer , dent gets away scot free .
why would an oil man risk this , even if he was broke?
dent's not buying oil equipment , he's buying guns from thomopolis .
selling them in central america .
why not split with the cash?
dent buys guns here for a million and sells them there for 10 million .
look at all that oil .
i don't see oil .
i see trucks .
come on , billy .
billy , what are you doing?
i've been wanting to wear this for a while .
are you nuts?
billy , we have got to talk .
what the hell is this?
you can never have too much firepower .
come on !
shit .
bogomil was here .
you like rap music?
yeah .
i'm from the rap coalition of america .
throw that gun over there .
lf you like rap music , why ain't you smiling?
i'm smiling .
smile .
let's rap together .
those look like oil pumps to you?
it looks like world war ill .
here , billy .
you don't have one of these , do you?
you guys hang around the back , i'll check out the front .
what are you doing?
element of surprise .
what?
are you nuts?
fool the connecting wire into thinking it's still intact .
these documents will make your life much easier .
you need to sign them .
you still got that thing?
it's a bad idea .
of all the ideas you had , this is the worst .
sure you know what you're doing?
trust me .
come on , axel !
get him !
get your head down !
pull pin .
what are you doing?
" extend .
pull open and ... " wow !
release safety .
aim through there , push this .
fuck rambo .
get me the fuck out of here .
cover me .
go , axel !
let's get the hell out of here !
hold it !
stay right there !
freeze !
all right !
lay your weapons down !
mr foley .
you involved yourself in business that doesn't concern you .
that was a mistake .
goodbye , mr foley .
women .
come on , let's go .
police !
you're under arrest !
i think they know that , billy .
drop your weapons !
put your hands on your heads !
they got their hands up .
what took you guys so long?
shit .
we're in trouble now .
god damn it !
axel's awol .
we can get out of this if we keep quiet .
don't say anything .
what the hell have you done here?
looks like a goddamn war zone .
what have you done , taggart?
we solved the alphabet crimes .
shut up .
who the hell is talking to you?
i solved the alphabet case over an hour ago .
and you !
i don't give a damn who you're working for .
you're in jail .
chief ...
shut up .
what are you doing , bringing a fire fight to my city?
you're out of the cop business !
will you just listen a minute?
you shut your mouth !
no goddamn !
you shut up !
this is what the alphabet crimes are about ... guns !
that guy sold them , then bought them with stolen money from adriano's at his own racetrack .
he was going to central america .
lf you'd take your head out of your ass , you'd see we solved the whole thing !
lutz , why didn't i know about this?
chief lutz doesn't have the guts to hear the truth .
we had to go undercover with foley to solve this case .
you're fired , taggart !
yeah?
kiss my ass !
kiss mine !
you're fired , too !
lutz , i've had it with your abusive attitude .
i'm sorry .
i get carried away .
you're fired .
do you understand?
don't overreact , ted .
i want you out of here now .
get out of here !
fired !
you'll regret this , ted .
i've regretted it for two months .
you too .
you're out of here .
will you get out?
are they civilians?
you bet .
i'll kick your ass later !
axel , thank you so much , really .
i've got a charity meeting for the homeless for beverly hills .
i'd like to make a donation .
here's $200 from sidney bernstein .
that's my alias .
i don't like publicity .
thank you , axel ...
i mean , sidney bernstein .

ted egan , mayor of beverly hills .
i told your mayor we're very thankful you allowed foley to help us .
he says he's acquired all his skills under your expert tutelage .
certainly .
he's just arrived .
expert tutelage?
what the fuck have you been saying?
let me talk to him .
now that you're done being a california hero , get your ass home to your real job .
i'm leaving now .
my ass left already .
i got to catch up with it .

here , you talk to jeffrey .
axel , it wasn't my fault .
there was a bus coming ...
hello?
he hung up .
hello?
you don't have to go home now .

it's back to detroit for some old fashioned street violence .
come with me .
your wife left you .
come hang out .
i know a lot of girls .
maureen came back .

congratulations .
the people you least expected , they're studs .
the man's a stud and we ain't even know it .
couldn't live without you?
her mother didn't have cable tv .
it wasn't no mother's cable tv .
your cable brought her back .
i'm off .
thanks a lot , axel .
don't thank me .
i love you guys .
see you around .
be cool , man .
anything we can do for you?
