you know why?
'cause i'm not a coach .
okay?
i don't know what i'm doing .
my dad .
he's a coach .
he knows the game .
he's confident , he's smart , witty , dynamic , vicious , brutal , vindictive .
a monster .
and he will win through intimidation and forceful tactics if need be .
i'm not like that .
ln fact , i don't know anyone like that .
do you?
so , paul , what's on your mind?

i don't know why that's funny .
god , i'm going to be honest , i i didn't plan on speaking tonight .
i i was i was actually hoping that my my assistant coach would be here , uh , to kind of ... [ audience murmuring ]
ladies and gentlemen , i would like to introduce mike ditka .
it's mike ditka , everyone !
say a few words .
thanks , paul , thanks , everybody .
it's it's great to be here and , uh , gonna have a lot of fun tonight .
paul's got the tigers on the move .

i couldn't really hear you .
my super bowl ring was making too much noise .
ooh .

read it and weep .
ditka is a great coach , we understand that , but he's a football coach .
understand?
right .
and we are still losing , phil .
okay , i understand your concern about our record , but with me it's not about win lose .
we are going to win one game eventually , right?
well , we've had a rocky start , but with a strong team effort , we will win some
i think .
remember , there's no " l " in team .
but there is an " l " in win .
there is an " l " in win .
hey , wait .
uh , parents , honey .
i didn't see you step up when the team was in need .
okay .
okay .
phil is not the greatest coach in the world ,
i'll give you that , but at least he's trying .
i can defend myself , please .
you think he enjoys losing week after week , in front of his own son?
you're making it worse .
you're making it worse .
what's with the birds?
that was weird .
i've got my hands full with hunter .
i don't need a bird .
okay , you know what?
you got me .
all right?
the finches were a bad idea .
and i wasn't going to say this , but i think some of them have salmonella .
a fair amount , in fact .
what?
i may have inadvertently poisoned your children .
you and i , we got something going .
you know , maybe we can coach the little league together .
you really think that , huh?
yeah .

yes?
hi .
um , uh , our son , byong sun , he's very shy and i was just wondering

i don't like it one bit .
yeah , well , he's right here .
i'm not blind .
what , are you trying to stick it to the old man?
you go to my mortal enemy for help?
that's no way to talk about your neighbor .
oh , yeah?
he's right .
i hated him from the first time i laid eyes on him .
maybe even before that , because i know you're the guy that wrote
ditka sucks " on my driveway .
what are you even doing here?
you're just doing this to get under my skin .
i'm glad you figured it out .
and i'm getting under your skin .
it's gonna get a lot worse before it gets better .
ln your dreams .
ooh .
hey , why don't you take that pretty young wife of yours and go home?
what did you call her?
hey guys , please .
it's a compliment .
i said she's lovely and she's young .
she's the light of my life .
you don't talk about her .
i go home when i want .
it's mike ditka .
he's big .
stay out of this .
i'll tell you for the last time .
hit the road !
who's gonna make me?
i am .
you're acting like oh !
i took a punch from hall of famer , mike ditka , and i did not go down .
sure , i wobbled a bit , but i did not go down .
that ditka has fists like a small truck .
come here .
okay .
yeah , you need to relax .
yeah .
you should've seen the look on my dad's face .
priceless .
'cause that punch was meant for him , that's what makes me feel so good .
okay , phil , can we please not talk about your dad or ditka tonight?
please?
l i ...
you just need to relax .
you're right .
yeah .
i'm sorry .
okay .
yeah , i just get [ both moaning ]
i'm in way over my head .
i got punched in the face and it hurt .

phil?
yeah?
i love you .
what does that have to do with anything?
okay .
i quit .
i give up .
i give up .
you go talk to ditka .
what for?
he scares me .
have you ever looked into his eyes?
or at his hair?
well , he's been coaching for a long time .
share your feelings with him .
you want me to share my feelings of inadequacy with mike ditka?
uh .
what else can you do?
okay .
you're right .
you're right .
you're always right .
i'm sorry .
i'll go talk to him .
okay?
okay .
and , phil ...
yeah? try not to cry in front of him .
hey , hey , get a grip on yourself , okay?
man up .
i can't .
you better or else i'm gettin 'out of here .
here , drink this coffee .
i don't like coffee .
it's a vasoconstrictor .
hey , coffee is the number one drink in the world .
everybody drinks it .
even little kids in mexico drink coffee .
well , i'm not a little kid in mexico .
okay? ln fact , i don't know who i am .
i took a long hard look at myself in the mirror , and you know what i saw?
what?
nothing .
my dad , he's something .
i mean , i've never lived up to my dad's expectations .
and to top it all off , i'm letting sam down .
my own son !
ah .
hey !
ow !
knock it off .
i don't care about that .
why is everyone slapping me lately?
drink the coffee .
it'll make you feel better .
i don't i don't like ... [ sniffing ]
um , uh ,
yeah .
uh huh . yeah , it's good .

it calms you down .
it's the lifeblood that drives the dreams of champions .
oh .

l i can't do it .
i can't coach .
i can't beat my old man .
you can beat your dad !
he's just a man .
this coaching business , paul , is tough stuff .
phil .
whatever .
it's tough stuff .
and when you lose , it all comes down on you .
but listen , when you put it all together , and you win , it's the greatest feeling in the world .
it's like winning the super bowl .
really?
yeah , really .
except , you saddled me with a bunch of stiffs .
take me 3 years to get these guys shaped up .
i'm sorry .
but i got a good idea .
maybe we take a shortcut , stick it to your old man real good .
but in order to do that , we gotta get some fresh meat .
okay .
keepa this up , you get nowhere in meat .

let me ask you a question .
let me ask a question .
how much you pay him to make those calls?
you are one wisecrack away from being thrown out of this game .
i don't want to get thrown out .
can't a guy just be enthusiastic about the game?
you can be enthusiastic ...
that's all i want to do . ... at a respectable level .
i just wanna have fun .

and keep your comments to yourself .

massimo with the ball , trying to pass it off to his brother .

but buck weston has figured out this tiger offense .
go !
get back on defense !
what did i just say?
bucky with another open shot .
goal !
yes !
gladiators take the lead .
was anyone listening?
the italians have effectively been shut down .
great .
that's my boy !
that's the half .
honey , wh where have you been?
i called you twice .
what?
why isn't sam in his uniform?
so , how's it going?
it took me all morning to convince him to come .
and the only reason he is here is to support his team .
what , he doesn't want to play for me?
he would love to play for you but you've turned him into a benchwarmer .
sound familiar?
look , i just wanted to get to the championship game , that ...
well , you're here , phil .
i'm not crying .
it's frustration .
don't worry .
you'll be all right .
gonna be all right .
lf you play the second half the way you played the first half ,
i'm gonna trade the whole team to the tigers next year .
can i go in now?
i have fresh legs .
philly , i can't .
it's the championship game , all right?
don't bother me , okay?
i didn't play the week before , either .
i promise you , i'll play you next season , okay?
you want to be gladiators?
yeah !
let's say , " we are gladiators .
we are gladiators !
say it again !
we are gladiators !
okay , go out in the second half , i want you to stay focused .
you doing okay?
i know this is tough .
hey , guys .
sam , you think i could talk to you?
i guess .
honey , do you mind?
sure .
so , i just was thinking , uh ...
you know , grown ups are always telling kids how they mess up , right?
but the truth is sometimes grown ups screw up but we don't have anyone to tell us when we do it .
i screwed up , sam .
you think?
i just got caught up in everything .
i really lost my way , i mean ,
i apologize .
i just wanna ask you if you if you can find it in your heart to forgive me and you give me a second chance ,
i'd like to make it up to you .
okay .
you accept my apology then?
yeah .
thanks , buddy .
all right .
you're starting the second half .
really?
yeah .
you're not worried about losing the game?

i brought your uniform just in case .

all right .
okay?
good job .

now , give me that jacket .
oh .

what are you talking about?
he's a lousy coach .
he didn't teach me anything .
he tried to kill me .
he taught us exactly how not to play soccer .

that's exactly what i did .
we just need to take the field and you guys just do e e exactly the opposite of everything i've taught you .
does that make sense?
