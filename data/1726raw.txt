sebastian , sebastian , stop pouting .
sorry .
i'm such a dope .
you are not a dope .
you're just misguided .
sebastian would make an exceptional student if only he would follow orders .
i can't believe you fed the school hamster an overdose of viagra .
i was testing the reproductive system for a science experiment ...
and i wanted to see how big  enough !
enough !
fortunately for you , you are moving to a new town .
you will have a chance to start anew .
it's time to shape up .
speaking of shaping up , how's mrs. freeman doing?
i see she's lost some weight .
she looks good .
thank you .
i gotta tell ya , it's a really great thing ... she's doing for the community , censoring books and all .
that catcher in the rye novel really screwed me up .
mrs. freeman knows what's best for young minds .
which comes to my point .
i was wondering what you planned on doing with my file?
it's not very favorable and  and ... you'd prefer if i didn't forward it to your new school .
i've thought long and hard about it ... and i've decided to send it .
i mean , if you've really changed , you'll rise above your past mistakes .
how can i ever thank you , sir?
well , you have got a plane to catch , and i have got some work to do .
the future is what you make of it .
the future is what i make of it .
the future is what i make of it .
got it .
i'll never forget you , sir .
yeah , yeah , right , right .
pansy .
ed freeman .
what the fuck have you done tome , you fucking asshole?
what's wrong , pumpkin?
have you seen my picture in the school yearbook?
uh , yes , you look wonderful .
wonderful?
i'm naked , you fucking idiot !
fuck .
i'm the laughingstock of the community .
how could you have let this happen?
you weaselly little piece of shit !
you'll pay for this !
ed , i hate you !
asshole !
don't think you are gonna get away with this stunt .
so where you heading?
new york city .
and i'm sending your file !
for you .
thanks .
you are finished !
bye bye .
sebastian valmont?
yeah .
i'll take care of the driver , sir .
your family's expecting you .
which apartment?
the whole building , sir .
of course .
what was i thinking?
oh , my god !
sebastian valmont to see you , sir .
ah , good to see you again , son .
good to see you , too , dad .
how's your mother?
oh , dr. rappaport thinks she's gonna be in rehab for the long haul .
thanks for taking me in .
you know , foster homes just aren't my thing .
think nothing of it .
man , you really hit the mother lode this time , pops .
sebastian , i would like you to meet the love of my life .
this is tiffany .
well , it's a pleasure to finally meet you .
i see you have your father's beautiful blue eyes .
thank you .
my , what a precious little kitty you have .
would you like to pet her?
some other time .
sebastian , come meet kathryn .
i've heard so much about you .
welcome to the family .
i've always wanted a brother , but they were sold out of them at bloomingdale's .
is that a real steinway?
i wouldn't play anything else .
may i?
be my guest .
kathryn is an exquisite pianist , sebastian .
really?
cute .
i think it needs a tuning .
mother , sebastian must be famished .
shouldn't we check on dinner?
i think that's a wonderful idea .
i'm so excited you'll be starting manchester with me tomorrow .
it's a wonderful institution ...
with wonderful teachers .
wonderful .
kathryn is president of the student body .
let's not forget president of the french club .
i live for extracurricular activities .
student body president?
i thought you were a sophomore .
i am .
i believe one should not be hampered in achieving one's goals ... simply by the paltriness of one's years .
you mean " dearth .
excuse me .
well , paltriness implies insignificance ... but really it's your lack of age that shouldn't hamper you ... from achieving your goals .
careful with those sat words .
they can be deadly .
thank you .
isn't kathryn just the best , son?
yeah , she's a real peach , dad .
i love you , step daddy .
i'm a little tired from all the travel .
do you mind if i turn in?
not at all .
i know you have a big day ahead of you tomorrow .
i'll show you to your room .
hey , you little asshole .
what do you think you're doing?
i was not what?
you hear me?
get down there !
do not fuck with me .
so ... he outdoes you at piano , he outdoes you at vocabulary .
i guess i overestimated you .
and don't sulk .
it's a sign of weakness .
yes , mother .
no , everything's fine .
i was just checking up on you , mom .
look , i promised i'd take care of you , right?
well , i'm gonna talk to dad and get you into a better facility .
it's the least he can do .
i love you too .
what the  let's get something straight !
i may not have fooled you , but i've got a great thing going with the rentals .
i don't have a curfew , they never bother me about my homework ... and i've got a five figure allowance .
no one and i mean no one is about to threaten my cushy lifestyle ... especially not some two bit hick loser .
but  i don't wanna hear it .
now , as for school , you stay out of my face ... and we'll get along just fine , but if you cross me once ...
i'll bury your sorry ass , understood?
all right .
i'm glad we could have this little discussion .
hmm .
not bad .
what's the matter?
this collar's too tight .
oh , i guess you're only used to wearing mesh shirts where you come from .
more sat vocabulary builders?
for your information , this happens to be my orientation speech .
who are you orienting?
please , be more stupid .
i am the student body president .
ivy league schools eat this extracurricular crap up for supper .
you do know what an ivy league school is?
stop !
gordon anderson looking good .
do me a favor .
pretend you don't know me .
my god , you're beautiful .
excuse me?
oh , i said you were beautiful .
thank you .
excuse me , but what did you mean by that remark?
what remark?
that i'm beautiful .
well , aren't you?
well , yeah .
i mean , no , no , but
never mind .
you're very strange .
i know .
are you here to see the headmaster?
yeah .
i heard he's a total joke .
i wouldn't know .
the headmaster will see you now .
i must say that in all my years in education ...
i have never seen a file quite like this .
4 . 0 gpa , president of several clubs ... all star snowboarding for your county ... as well as several glowing letters from your teachers ... including your former principal .
we were very close , he and i , sir .
yes , it's most impressive .
thank you .
perhaps a little too impressive .
thank you .
that aside , i'm sure an enterprising young man like yourself ... would be a welcome addition here at manchester .
thank you , sir .
come in .
you had a few grammaticals , but nothing reprehensible .
thank you , honey .
sebastian , i'd like you to meet my daughter , danielle .
you're both in the same class .
you look familiar .
have we met?
no , i don't think so .
are you sure?
must've been someone else .
well , i'd better get going .
it was very nice meeting you , sir .
ma'am .
good luck , sebastian .
thank you , sir .
seems like a nice kid .
don't you think?
we'll see .
with our almamater we will grow
hail to thee o stars of pride
hail to thee
manchester
be seated .
we will now hear from your new student body president ...
kathryn merteuil .
fellow students , faculty , administrators and custodians ...
i would personally like to welcome each and every one of you ... to what i think will be manchester's proudest year .
she is such an inspiration .
i consider ... each and every one of you ... members of my manchester prep family .
with that said , i feel it is our responsibility to ... reach out and accept all new students ... as members of
and accept all new students as
settle down , people .
please .
as i was saying , i consider each and every one of you ... members of my manchester prep
are you all right?
sorry .
it happens when i get nervous .
guess i just need a bubble gum fix .
keep going .
you're doing great .
thanks .
once again , as i was saying ...
i consider each and every one of you members ... of my manchester prep family .
with that said , i feel that it is our responsibility to reach out ... and accept all new students
somebody !
somebody do something !
somebody call 91 1 or something .
good going , danielle .
bravo !
terrific .
right .
sparing me the cliff notes synopsis .... who can tell me what this means?
mr. winkler .
jekyil was a doctor ... and he developed this potion that transformed into ...
edward hyde , his evil side .
my gosh , did that answer suck .
now come on , i know you've got it in you .
what themes can be discussed here?
miss sherman .
i think stevenson is talking about the duality of man .
man has both good and evil in him .
if man cannot suppress his evil instincts , he is inevitably doomed .
wrong !
care to elaborate on that?
nowhere in the novel does stevenson mention good over evil .
in fact , it's just the opposite .
jekyil loved hyde so much that he protected him from the world .
he protected hyde so he wouldn't hurt people .
please .
he loved hurting people .
then why does jekyil kill himself?
where does it say that in the book?
the end !
mr. utterson found his body .
utterson was idiotic .
your point is idiotic .
all right , all right .
break it up , you two .
wow !
am i losing my mind ... or did we just witness an intellectual debate in this classroom?
although i disagree with your conclusions , mr. valmont ...
i do appreciate your warped point of view .
as for you , miss sherman ...
i think you could be a little more tolerant of other people's opinions .
hey , fellas , welcome back .
hey , rene , good to see you .
assistant headmaster mueller !
steve .
i thought i told you not to call me by my first name .
we need to talk .
later .
i'm busy right now .
stop that .
i said , we need to talk .
what is it?
do you see something wrong?
i have gym .
you know i loathe gym .
we merteuils do not like to perspire .
what is this " we merteuils " nonsense?
you're a student .
try acting like one .
excuse me?
look , kathryn , rules are rules .
i'm sorry , but you're going to gym .
i understand .
you do?
yes .
but it's a bit strange ...
'cause isn't it against the rules for someone of your age to seduce a minor ...
like you did to me this summer in the hamptons?
now you know that's not entirely true .
it was you who seduced me .
you know , you're right .
it was me who seduced you .
but then again , who will the school board believe?
it's my word against yours .
think about it , steve .
something like this could ruin your career ... not to mention your marriage .
but i guess if you can bend the rules a little , then so can i.
i'll see what i can do .
you're the best .
this meeting of the manchester tribunal will now come to order .
kathryn merteuil presiding .
thank you , blaine .
fellow students of affluence and popularity ...
i welcome you to this year's first meeting of the manchester tribunal .
as your new leader , i promise to do my best ... to weed out the geeks , losers and underprivileged ... and toss their fat asses out of our school .
here's the latest shipment , mrs. gagin .
thank you .
could you re shelf these for me?
thanks .
my god !
a cartoon cock?
hi .
are you all right?
you scared me to death .
you dropped this .
i didn't drop it .
yes , you did , but it's all right .
sexual curiosity is nothing to be ashamed of .
i'm not ashamed , and i have a very healthy sexual curiosity .
really?
so what are you doing here?
i work here .
do you think you can take a 1 5 minute break and join me for a cup of coffee?
i'd love to , but unfortunately i have a lot of work to do around here .
mrs. gagin , do you mind if danielle joins me for a coffee break?
please , go right ahead .
there's nothing to do right now .
thank you .
you don't quit , do you?
whatever happened to " be nice to the new kid in school "?
fifteen minutes .
go .
next .
michael keen , freshman .
former bmoc of his junior high school .
don't let his bad acne dissuade you , though .
his father owns the coliseum .
let's get him a facial and see if he can score front row tickets to hole .
next .
sebastian valmont , sophomore .
son of edward and corrine .
go on .
i can't .
he's a transfer student , and i don't have any more information on him yet .
don't you know anything else about him?
he is your stepbrother .
i've only known him for a day .
he's a total loser .
i mean , he shops at the gap .
stay on him and see what you can find out .
will do .
next .
cherie clayman , freshman .
daughter of hubert and bunny .
annual family income
well? $850 million .
she's richer than kathryn .
i heard that .
she has a gpa of 1 . 3 , and not only is she a virgin ... but she never even kissed a boy before .
okay , this girl is a walking teletubby ... just begging to be made an example of .
i think i'll oversee this one personally .
when i get through with her , she will be the premiere slut at manchester prep .
next order of business : grievances .
yes , lauren?
well , it appears we're having a bit of trouble with the new school chef .
mr. washington seems to think that sushi ... is an inappropriate meal for growing girls and boys .
all those in favor of sending mr. washington ... back to his hot dog stand , say aye .
aye !
aye .
okay , bye bye , mr. washington .
hello , mr. yakamoto .
so , what's a nice girl like you doing at a snobbish school like manchester?
it's called free tuition .
besides , it's not as bad as it seems .
my dad took over the place a year after my mom passed away .
i'm sorry .
your turn .
okay .
folks split up ten years ago .
mom has a drug problem .
and everyone thought it would be best if i moved in with my dad .
you get along with him?
i don't really know him .
he's on his fourth marriage .
to kathryn's mom?
yeah .
i know this is rude , but what's it like growing up with all that money?
well , you know , i'm only one day into it .
sorry to disappoint you , my dear , but richie rich i'm not .
and i thought i was the only one at manchester .
you ever get the feeling you're being watched?
yours?
hers .
there you are , silly goose .
i've been looking all over for you .
hi , danielle .
how's the used bookstore?
don't let her get to you .
she doesn't .
maybe it makes me uncool , but i don't care what your stepsister thinks of me .
actually , i think that makes you very cool .
well , i'd better get going .
i don't want her to make me hitch a ride home .
thanks for coffee .
yeah .
i'll call you later .
but you don't have my number .
don't underestimate me .
don't underestimate kathryn .
let's go .
see you .
bye .
nice first day , retard?
it was great !
this uptight bitch got gum stuck in her hair .
touch? .
hi .
cherie , it's kathryn , from school .
no , i don't hate you .
as a matter of fact , i was just appointed your big sister .
can you come out tonight?
it's a school event .
great !
i'll pick you up at 8 : 00 .
see you , sweetie .
you're going out with the girl who spit gum in your hair?
keep your friends close and your enemies closer .
come on , kathryn .
she's just a freshman .
pick on someone your own size .
like you?
in due time .
so , you have a thing for boring virgins .
danielle is a virgin , you know?
careful , kathryn .
i'm better at this than you .
ooh .
you actually have a backbone .
don't push me , kathryn .
any time you want to start a war
i'll keep it under consideration .
36 : 1 5 .
yeah !
good evening , master sebastian .
and how was your evening jaunt?
not bad , henry .
not bad at all .
where are the folks?
dinner with a sheik .
cook has your meal ready .
will you be showering before or after dinner , sir?
i hadn't really thought about it .
very well .
anything i can do to make your evening more relaxing , just let me know .
thanks , henry .
this way , sir .
please make yourself comfortable .
g? nter has prepared sweetbread mousse .
it's like dinner at the adams family .
guys .
hello?
anyone?
yes , sir .
is everything all right?
henry , i think i'll get something later , go out or something .
very well , sir .
if you need the car , just let frederick know .
sure .
no , it's not like that at all .
well , of course , i miss you .
you do?
we'll get together very soon .
i promise .
okay .
what are you wearing?
just edward !
i have to go .
i didn't hear you knock .
i didn't .
that was my accountant on the phone .
wow !
you guys must have a really tight relationship .
now , look , son , don't make me regret taking you in .
well , i see that old habits die hard , or , in your case , don't die at all .
i'm your father , and i demand to be treated with some respect .
a man has needs  look , dad , spare me the melodrama .
but , a word of advice?
you got a pretty good thing going here .
i wouldn't screw it up , if i were you .
you know , sebastian , i really like these father son chats .
you're a real role model .
would you sit the fuck down !
thanks , moose .
shut up , losers .
one mineral water , one iced tea .
this sure doesn't taste like an iced tea .
it's from long island .
here , have another .
what's the latest , kathryn?
me , as usual .
court , i'd like you to meet cherie clayman .
how's it going , cherie?
excuse me .
i think we should adjourn to the ladies 'room .
but i don't have to go .
i do .
so what do you need my help for?
ow !
want some more?
no .
back in a flash .
right .
so how do you know he likes me?
i can see it in his eyes .
if you say so .
so what do i do about it?
you're gonna have to let him fuck you .
but i've never even been to first base with a guy .
well , so we'll start with first base and then we'll move on .
okay .
okay .
ready?
ready .
that was easy .
okay , we're gonna try this again .
this time i want you to close your eyes .
court's gonna stick his tongue in your mouth .
i want you to massage his tongue with yours .
okay?
ready .
you idiot !
these are $300 pants .
i'm sorry .
oh , god !
stupid bitch .
he hates me .
there , there .
shh .
hello?
i told you not to underestimate me .
you're unbelievable .
thank you .
oh , come on .
the tv series mash was way better than the movie .
if you say so .
i do .
what time is it?
it's 1 0 : 30 .
we've been talking for over an hour .
whoo .
call the police .
ha ha .
i should get going .
homework .
hey , listen , what are you up to on saturday?
i'm looking for a tour guide to show me the sights .
oh , i can't , i have plans .
come on , you gotta rescue me from my psycho stepsister .
at least a few hours .
look , don't you think we should take this slower?
you know , i don't really know you and
take what slow?
i wasn't asking you on a date .
i just wanted to make a new friend .
i know , i wasn't
man , are you conceited .
no , i'm not conceited .
it's just
i have to go .
hello?
hello?
always make an impression .
psycho stepsister?
evening .
evening .
oh , she shot you down .
exactly the opposite .
so what's on the agenda?
matinee of the lion king?
man , you really have it out for her , don't you?
it must really burn your ass that with all your money and popularity ... she still won't have anything to do with you .
face it , kathryn she's outclassed you .
how dare you talk to me like that , you son of a bitch?
well , this has been fun .
unfortunately , i have some work to do , and you have to go throw up .
after all , it was a very big salad you had for dinner .
have you been spying on me?
oh , my god , i ate a crouton !
we'll see who gets the last laugh , brother dear .
oh , no , i'm sorry !
it's all my fault .
i wasn't thinking .
i'll get it .
i'll clean it up .
sorry .
it's okay .
it's okay .
stop crying .
just don't tell anyone .
what is this , ben hur?
do they beat you here?
please don't tell anyone .
min lin , relax .
christ , it's like a fucking godzilla movie .
you girls know the routine?
seduce .
and destroy .
shut up .

more like kissing cousins .
whoa !
slippery when wet .
so , you're seeing danielle sherman?
who?
oh , yeah , yeah , trying to .
she's a sweet girl .
you guys would make a great couple .
just too bad you're gonna miss out on all the action .
what action?
oh , come on .
with the exception of danielle , manchester prep's a virtual whorehouse .
as the school motto goes ...
if you don't snort it , suck it .
careful .
he splurged .
but you won't have to worry since you'll be dating the headmaster's daughter .
no .
guess not .
see you on campus .
ring toss .
score .
yes !
thanks for , you know , sharing .
here , sis , i'll dry you off .
thanks .
shit .
breakfast was late , my skirt is mussed ... and i needed the car last night .
i'm sorry , miss merteuil  no excuses !
now , just because my mother is out of town does not mean you can slack off .
each lapse , each oversight , will be reported .
good , you haven't left .
what's this?
saddam addressing the troops?
allow me , sir .
no , it's all right , henry .
there , there , sir .
pay close attention .
the perfect windsor is an art .
rough night last night?
there was a pea under my mattress .
i'll look into it , sir .
no , henry , it was great .
it was a ten .
can we go now , or do we send kapoor in our place?
i almost forgot .
here are your allowances .
what's this?
annual?
semiannual?
weekly , of course .
this is amazing .
the leftovers , sir .
it's what i like to call mad money .
yeah , mad .
unless you use it to make someone happy .
for the windsor and the advice .
thank you , sir .
thank you very much .
very kind .
tutor me in french?
tutor me in french?
danielle !
oh , my gosh , am i glad i found you?
look , i am flunking french , like tres flunking it .
d minus .
have you been studying?
of course , i study like crazy , but it just goes in one hole and out the other .
well , i wish i could help you .
you can !
you can tutor me .
mom said i can pay you , unless that's like too totally insulting ... because , you know , we've got money , and you're the headmaster's daughter ... and headmasters make , like , zilch .
thanks .
tutor me , please , please .
i'll pay you $200 an hour , $200 .
stop .
of course i'll tutor you .
the money doesn't matter .
going rate will be fine .
god , why does everything have to be about money?
'cause it's cool .
do you hear a phone?
yeah .
oh , wait .
sounds like it's coming from here .
i don't have a phone .
you do now .
answer me .
oh , my god , so cool .
is it your birthday or something?
hello?
do you like the phone?
i might , if it comes with an explanation .
it does , actually .
i think i may have real feelings for you .
it's sebastian valmont , isn't it?
just a second , okay?
sorry .
not you .
her .
who's her?
look , i can't do this from a phone .
but it's a good phone .
digital .
where are you?
you can't be too far .
look down .
oh , it is sebastian valmont .
don't move .
i'm coming down there .
move , einstein .
hey !
where are you?
close your eyes .
why?
just trust me .
close your eyes .
i'll look silly .
close them now .
danielle , wait !
the best laid plans sometimes suck .
miss merteuil .
but i'm excused from gym .
gym , yes .
ballet , no .
well , there must be something i can do to change your mind .
i think you've got the wrong guy .
now get your ass to ballet .
mr. erwick .
i was very clear .
keep me out of gym ...
and ballet .
i can't do anything , all right?
hargrove called me into his office .
he's suspicious , i heard it in his voice .
why do you think that is?
well , i'm not sure .
the disciplinary committee , of course .
you stuttered and stammered like a completely whipped fool ... and then when you voted , it was obvious you voted the way i wanted you to vote .
but that's how you did want me to vote .
oh , my god , i'm a mess .
you're always one step ahead of me .
i don't know what to do anymore .
it's a dirty old man's catch 22 .
shut up , steve .
get control of yourself .
i can't .
i'm falling apart .
my wife doesn't turn me on anymore , my kids hate me .
i should just quit .
stop blubbering .
i'll go back to gym and ballet .
you will?
the excuse slips were just a test .
the day will come when i'll need you for a favor a big favor and you'll do it without question .
of course .
i worship you , kathryn .
worship works best on your knees , steve .
please be quiet .
i'm trying to imagine i'm with someone attractive .
sorry .
hello !
anybody !
oh , my god , she is terrible .
if it's so bad here , why don't you guys just quit?
it's steady employment , sir .
this is a good address .
we could be down in the 50s !
or worse , scarsdale .
ladies there make me crazy !
all the time sending me to the market looking for gefilte .
my father fisherman for 20 years he never caught one gefilte .
what is a gefilte?
three kings .
man !
that beats my two pairs .
i got crap .
full house , jacks over threes .
you win again , master sebastian .
you know , henry , i really wish you'd quit with the " master " thing .
but sir , it's your title .
it shows privilege .
yeah , well , what has it gotten me?
i poured all my money into gifts and didn't get the girl .
danielle hates my wealth or resents it or something .
perhaps it's not my place to speak , sir .
no , henry , please .
i'm desperate here .
well , maybe she doesn't want to feel like she's being bought .
you think that's it?
i don't know .
women are complicated .
it's been my experience , sir , that women are more interested ... in the soul of a man than in his trappings .
what is going on around here?
i had to ring and ring .
and where were you , frederick?
i paged you four times .
i had to take a cab .
a cab !
i'm sorry , we were just
get out of here , all of you .
and you can be damned sure my mother's gonna hear about this .
no , she won't .
what did you say?
you're not telling anybody about this .
this was my idea .
i ordered them to play cards .
and to drink mother's prized 1939 neufdu pape?
great year .
blitzkrieg , wasn't it?
don't get smart .
whether you realize it or not , you are still a guest in this house .
you know , you treat these people like dirt .
no wonder they don't respect you .
we pay them for service , not respect .
maybe someday you'll learn that .
and one day you'll realize that they're human beings .
just give me a second here .
party's over .
you know , i don't get it .
look , if you hate your mother so much ... why work so hard to be just like her?
is that what you think i'm doing?
well , you're obviously trying to prove something to someone .
no one's this mean , unless unless there's a whole bunch of pain and suffering behind it .
you think you have it so tough , having to come into this strange house ... with strange people try growing up here .
try spending every moment of your life just making up for just being here .
that doesn't make any sense .
no , it doesn't , does it?
you feel out of place , sebastian?
you want to fit in?
guess what .
so do i.
what a mess .
hello .
sebastian?
it's cherie .
news flash .
danielle is totally , madly in love with you .
madly in love with me?
she hates me .
every move i make is the wrong move .
yeah , but she told me stuff ..
every time she thinks about you , every time she sees you , she gets all moist . " moist "?
her eyes she gets tears in them .
but look , time's running out .
you gotta move now .
she'll be in the city tonight dinner with her favorite aunt , riverside cafe .
i figure if you go there , bare your soul
no gifts though .
she hates that money thing .
hello?
closet street performer .
now you know all my secrets .
how did you know i was here?
nope .
already know .
cherie the blabbermouth .
weird girl , but if you get beyond all the " totallys " and " oh , my gods " ... there's real truth there .
i have to catch my train .
let me come with .
i'll make sure you get home all right .
you can come as far as the station and only if you can do it without talking .
not another word that's my condition .
condition accepted .
all right , all right !
stop !
i give up , okay?
we can talk .
stop playing .
you know , i think this is the most romantic city on earth millions of strangers meeting in restaurants , parks , sidewalks a romance born every five seconds , every heartbeat .
i mean , god , is this a great city or what?
this is exactly what i'm talking about .
you spout bs on a continuous basis .
only because i can't say what i really want to say .
say it !
okay .
i wanna know what happened at school , in the courtyard .
i kissed you , and you just ran off .
i'm crazy about you !
i'm trying everything i can to make you like me .
be yourself .
be honest .
why is that so difficult?
i don't know .
maybe i'm scared .
you know , i'm new here , right?
new to this city ... new at school ...
living in a house full of certifiable wackos ... and i don't have any friends ... at least , any i can trust .
and i'm confused .
god's honest truth , i'm in a state of perpetual confusion .
so what are you scared of?
missing my train .
see you at school .
bye .
as you know , your mother gets home tonight .
and you want me to keep quiet about the poker game .
i don't like these ideas sebastian's putting in your head .
i mean no disrespect .
well , i'm offended .
leave .
i'll finish alone .
min lin , wait .
why don't you and i get to know each other , like with sebastian last night?
do i have to?
come on , it'll be fun .
here .
i'll jump right in .
where are you from china , japan?
cambodia actually .
cambodia wonderful country .
and when did you come to our united states?
my family fled through vietnam .
ultimately , we were 1 20 crammed into a boat the size of your pantry .
oh , my gosh , that reminds me of this time in denver , coming home from aspen .
the first class lounge was packed .
we almost had to fly coach .
anyway , so your family fled the khmer rouge?
nothing subtle about that shade of rouge .
see?
we do have a lot in common .
will there be anything else , miss kathryn?
no , that's all .
i'm glad we did this , aren't you?
oh , yes .
very enlightening .
bitch .
you got all your pronouns mixed up .
nous " is " we .
vous " is " you .
unless it's someone you're crazy , madly in love with ... in which case it's " tu , " as in you and sebastian .
i swear , that thing with the phone so cool .
i mean , if it had been me and some guy
i would have piddled right there on the spot .
oh , wait , did i show you my doodle?
excuse me?
my doodle , my sketch .
wow .
you've got some talent , cherie .
i mean , do you really like him?
is this it?
is it the real thing?
like i even know what that is .
knees go weak , mouth goes dry ... you get that little tingling feeling in that special place .
he's just so slick , so sure of himself .
i have a lot of trouble trusting him .
he can't just come out and talk to me , say what he's really feeling ... and neither can i.
okay , chapter three .
read the translation of the first passage . " love is a sublime melting pot in which men and women are fused together .
the lover is a priest , the ravished virgin a trembling sacrifice .
a priest and a virgin?
that's sick !
move .
move .
hi , mr. nagao !
hello , ladies !
i make a special eel and cuke roll today .
it's so sad about mr. washington .
i mean , the fact that they found a dead rat in that student's sloppy joe .
he'll never work again .
so , you never told us how it went with cherie .
did you bury her?
let's say she's on her way to ruin .
everything's set for this weekend .
what are you talking about?
uh , duh .
i told my mom how much fun we had ... and she invited you and your mom over for nonfat lattes .
your mom told my mom that you can sleep over .
i got the new hanson album !
okay , i gotta go .
gordon anderson promised he'd show me his one eyed snake , whatever that is .
okay , see you .
wow , kathryn , you really showed her .
don't talk .
don't say a word .
it's my turn to explain .
all i've done is hound you about being honest ... when i couldn't do it myself .
that kiss in the courtyard , sebastian it was more than just a kiss .
i'll say .
no , let me finish .
you see ... it was my first kiss .
i wanted it to be perfect and right and with the right boy ... and , while you might have been the right boy , the rest was totally not right .
i embarrassed you .
i embarrassed myself .
because i know you're used to girls with all this experience ... and you've probably been kissing girls forever ... and that's what i was afraid to tell you .
i happen to think this is wonderful , all right?
so you weren't exactly up front and honest .
join the club .
i wanted it to be perfect ... not the tail end of some prank .
does that make any sense?
yeah .
you know , some things can't be orchestrated .
some things have to be spontaneous , like a kiss .
like the kiss we're about to have right now .
say something , quick .
i can't .
i have to go .
last bell .
okay , but ... just back away so i know you're not running away .
that was wonderful just precious .
how long were you there?
i've never kissed a boy before i mean , the right boy ... and you've probably been kissing girls forever .
you must feel like a terrible dope , leading on that poor , lovesick girl .
you don't know what you're talking about .
a few weeks of hand holding and chaste smooching ... and you'll be so bored and horny you'll mess the whole thing up .
of course , i could wipe her off the map tomorrow .... but i think i'll let this little romance just flicker out all on its own .
i like the girl , okay?
i like her a lot .
you screw it up , and i'll screw you up .
nobody ever threatens me .
i just did or weren't you listening?
you do realize this means war .
then war it is .
lovely .
well , i feel badly for you , i really do ... but byron needs to be groomed every day at 3 : 00 .
well , you'll just have to reschedule your daughter's birthday .
now , i want him saddled and ready to ride when i arrive .
don't keep me waiting .
idiot !
there's a new student at manchester cherie clayman .
did she die?
i take it you don't like her .
i can't stand her .
she's actually very sweet , so i'm turning her into the school slut .
well , she's now your new best friend .
why?
you're not hitting up the claymans for a donation to manchester .
sorry , mother .
i think it's an excellent idea .
the claymans will join us at 7 : 00 .
you invited them here?
mother , they're from california .
kathryn , i need this .
just 20 million more and we can break ground on the tiffany merteuil library .
well , you ladies seem to be enjoying yourselves .
you must be tense , sebastian .
yeah , well , you'd be too if you were failing gym .
i mean , who ever heard of fencing as a sport?
perhaps a massage would help .
i've never had a massage before .
you can have my table .
i'm suddenly not in the mood .
mycket , " not " myckesh .
kathryn , if you're not going to say it correctly , don't say it at all .
it just makes you look foolish .
thank you for the correction , mother .
now , if you'll excuse me .
i think i could get used to this .
hi .
dead puppies , dead puppies , dead puppies ... old nuns in their underwear
i thought you'd left .
is that sonja or ingrid?
it's tiffany .
i hope you enjoyed your massage .
i think i'll go take a shower .
we've had so little time together , sebastian .
we can't be a happy family if we don't get to know each other a little better .
you're right , mom .
we should talk more , mom .
with your father working on the yacht so much , i'll have plenty of time for you .
you know , some nights he doesn't even come home .
he loves that yacht .
i'm glad he found something he's so committed to .
well , the right woman will do that .
and you think i'm the right woman?
definitely .
he's a changed man .
of course .
without me he'd still be in miami giving charters to geriatrics .
it's not the money , it's you .
he loves you .
you're a smart boy , sebastian .
you seem to understand your father very well .
i hope so .
so do i , because if you're wrong , you're both going to end up out on the street .
she spanked me .
oh , baby .
oh , that feels so good .
oh , yeah , you like that , huh?
dad , you here?
fuck !
fuck !
hey , son , how's it goin '?
in bed already?
oh , it's just a catnap .
what are you doing?
oh , i'm just looking for the cat .
here , puss , puss , puss , puss , puss .
i hope you're not suggesting i'm having an affair .
i'm not suggesting anything .
i'm your father ... and i will not be treated like a criminal !
criminal .
you could have fooled me .
and behind door number three we have
hello .
sebastian , meet lilly ... my first mate .
lilly , i'm sebastian , edward's son .
oh , my god , you have your father's eyes .
are you a libra?
let's just cut right to the chase , shall we?
he offered to sail you around the world , didn't he?
how did you know?
leave right now , or you're grounded for a week .
did he tell you he's married?
i was waiting for the right time .
you lied to me?
more an error of omission .
you see , she's very sick .
i may be single any day now .
go to hell !
sebastian , you think you could help me out here?
okay , okay , i know we talked about this ... but you're a man , and you have to understand
you have to understand .
it's not just your life anymore , dad , it's mine too .
don't screw it up for me .
absolutely .
you can count on me , son .
the keys , please?
you know , you made your bed .
now lie in it .
well , this sucks .
i can't believe i was so stupid .
i really thought your dad liked me .
it's not your fault .
he's the master of deceit .
he should be in the pathological liars 'hall of fame .
he was in the hall of fame?
never mind .
can i ask you something?
sure .
why are men such jerks?
i mean , is it genetic or something?
you know , they promise you the world , that you're the one for them ... and that their wives don't understand them anymore .
and i fall for it every time .
i'm like a doormat .
they're always coming and going ... and coming and going , and coming and
my life sucks .
lilly , you don't need a man to be happy .
if you're not happy alone , you're not gonna be happy with someone else .
you're a very attractive woman .
you could have anyone you want .
you just have to wait for the right guy to come along .
you think i'm attractive?
i think you're beautiful .
you're so sincere .
you're not like your father at all .
okay .
glad you were paying attention .
do you wanna come back to my place?
i'd love to , but i have an oral report due in the morning .
oh , i'm great at orals .
yeah .
try me .
no , thank you .
listen , i'm gonna split .
are you gonna be okay?
yeah , i'll be fine .
psycho .
i lived in fresnomy whole life .
les too .
but we wanted more for cherie , so when les sold the biz ... we decided to move to the big apple .
and how are you finding manchester?
oh , it's no problem .
our driver he takes me right there .
she's asking you if you like it , honey .
oh , yeah , it's the best .
and kathryn's been , like , so super nice .
you know , some girls they told me to stay away from her ...
like she had permanent pms or something .
ew , gross !
but she's been , like , totally awesome !
i can tell she's going to be very popular .
oh , i won't be as popular as you . " popular " is such a bore .
the important thing is school spirit , and nobody has as much as my mother .
i do a little work for the school fund raising committee .
you are so modest .
mother's already raised half the money needed for the new school library .
how much money have you raised?
well , she barely has to do anything .
the parents practically throw it at her .
why do they throw money at you?
because charity is smiled upon by the ladies who lunch .
society , cherie .
you know the social ladder?
oh , yeah .
my mom said now that we're rich ... we gotta start climbing that thing .
ow !
what?
isn't she precious?
would you excuse me?
pardon me .
certainly .
so , how much money do you need?
oh , i didn't invite you over here to discuss fund raising , bunny ... but if you'd care to make a donation , we'd certainly consider it .
really?
why , thank you .
my pleasure .
oh , hi , honey .
how was your day?
i can explain this .
there's no need to explain .
i know you love my mother very much .
yes .
exactly .
and sebastian and i are just getting close .
i know you'd never do anything to break up our happy home .
oh , no , never .
so let's make sure it stays happy .
i want you to take mother to dinner at au troquet for dinner tomorrow night .
i'll make reservations at 8 : 00 .
at 8 : 45 , an accordion player will pass by .
when he does , request " under my thumb " by the rolling stones .
mick jagger makes mother all hot and bothered .
jagger .
got it .
while she's listening ... slip this on her finger , then kiss her eight seconds , no tongue .
are you getting all this?
after dinner , grappa one glass then bring her home , make love to her two viagra any questions?
just in case , i've written it all down for you .
now , who's your favorite daughter?
you are .
what a shame .
morning !
great day , isn't it?
bite me , rich boy !
ah , new york a wonderful town .
you look fabulous .
thank you .
you got everything?
you all set?
yeah .
you ought to take some money , just in case you need a cab , miss the train
don't worry , dad .
i'll be fine .
come on , this is my job to worry .
what's wrong?
nothing .
just thought about your mom .
go on .
have a good time .
okay .
bye .
bye .
sebastian thought you'd like it better than the train .
wow .
i am so excited .
you know , i'm kind of nervous .
i've never been on a horse before .
don't worry .
i won't let anything bad happen to you .
if i like it , then i'll have daddy buy me a horse ... then we can spend every weekend together .
you'll love it .
i promise .
very good , cherie .
back on the horse now .
i think we're ready to try advanced jumping .
i don't know .
he keeps throwing me off .
all right .
if you're going to be a scaredy cat ...
i guess we'd better go back to the basics manuela?
nice horsey .
okay .
now , using the stirrups ...
i want you to push up and down in the saddle that's called posting .
now we need to add the back and forth motion .
when you hit the saddle , push backward , then forward .
up and down , back and forth , faster , faster .
up and down , back and forth , faster , faster .
good .
this time i want you to really grind into the saddle .
okay .
up and down , back and forth ... faster , faster .
how does that feel?
okay .
up and down .
i think i'm getting it .
posting is fun .
faster , faster .
really fun .
are you okay?
i've never felt better .
now i know why girls like horses .
wait .
i don't know if i'm ready for this .
it's cool .
i'm sorry .
it's just that yesterday was my first kiss ... and now you're practically touching my breast .
at this rate , your dick will be in my mouth by lunch .
anyone for lunch?
i'm kidding .
i'm kidding .
listen , danielle , we can take this as slow as you want .
i like you .
i've no need to rush things .
that's not my problem .
i want to rush things .
i'm tired of being the only virgin in the sophomore class at manchester .
are you telling me that everyone in the sophomore class has done it?
well , it sure feels like it .
i don't know .
ever feel like you're at war with yourself?
constantly .
i mean , there's one side of me ... that wants you to throw me down right here and rip my clothes off .
then there's this other side of me that thinks i should wait till i'm married .
which side should i choose , sebastian?
you really want me to answer that?
come on , be my friend .
listen , danielle ...
i know exactly what you're going through .
we all have two sides .
i struggle with my dark side every day .
but that was the old me .
believe it or not , i have you to thank for it .
you showed me that it was okay to be a decent person .
how dark was your past?
pitch black .
i'm thinking
i think i'm falling in love with you .
but i'm afraid to take the chance to get hurt .
i'm afraid of getting hurt too .
listen , let's make a pact .
we'll take it slow , and we won't hurt each other .
god , we sound like a cancelled television series .
you don't have to do this .
i want to .
hello?
hi , daddy .
i know , i'm running late .
tell aunt gloria we can still make the 2 : 00 mass .
yeah , i'll call you when i get there .
i love you too .
you gotta go?
it's okay .
sorry .
call me later?
sure .
okay .
toodles .
bye bye .
oh , my balls .
here's something you might like .
dolce .
how '98 of you .
do you carry any real fur?
no , all of our fur is faux .
of course .
the animals how silly of me .
i figured you'd be here .
what's up?
it's about sebastian .
give me the dirt .
your stepbrother has quite the checkered past .
i mean , the fact that he was able to pay off that overnight delivery guy ... and switch his school file?
that's impressive even by my standards .
that's just the tip of the iceberg .
well done .
cash or charge?
i'll be there in an hour .
sounds great .
the new james van der beek film's playing in town .
perfect .
you're sure your dad won't mind?
no , he's out of town for the night .
it's just me and mr. whiskers . " mr. whiskers "?
my pussy , silly .
okay , well , i'll see you soon .
all right .
bye .
the school virgin's home alone with her pussy , and i'm taking her to see dawson .
god , i've become a total fag .
i guess i misjudged you .
what are you talking about?
how'd you get this?
i have my ways .
kathryn , i'm trying to start over  oh , blah , blah , blah , blah , please .
spare me any sob stories .
oh , dear .
i guess something like this ... could destroy your squeaky clean reputation at manchester .
and that school psychologist's report about your mom it's too bad .
how will she pay for rehab when i tell mommy where some of her money's going?
you're playing with fire , kathryn .
poor sebastian's mom is going to be ... homeless and eating leftovers out of the garbage .
you don't know what i'm capable of .
yes , i do .
i read your file .
it turns me on .
fuck off .
going to see danielle?
leave her out of it !
looks like we've hit a sensitive spot .
do you really think you can change , sebastian?
you and i are two of a kind .
we're just not cut out for good deeds .
i know the drill .
you'll date danielle ... probably sleep with her after what you think eight months?
and then you'll get bored , and you'll break her heart .
why don't you just spare her the pain?
and do what?
date you?
we could make a good team .
what do you plan on doing with my file?
do i sense a merger in the air?
perhaps .
you do realize you're my stepsister .
you know what they say about incest .
is there any line you won't cross?
only one : never in the butt .
that's a good line .
the bradys never had it so good .
i can't do this .
not with your pants on .
i gotta go .
you fucking pussy !
i gotta get outta this house .
what , is this about danielle?
you don't understand , kathryn .
i love her .
you have a funny way of showing it .
fuck you .
i won't let you corrupt me .
don't you see?
you can't change .
i can try .
well , you're gonna die trying .
hello?
hello , danielle?
sebastian , you're soaking .
we have to talk .
well , come inside before you catch yourself pneumonia .
here .
thanks .
what's wrong?
i don't know , it's
it's okay .
you can talk to me .
go slow .
i just i feel like i'm losing it .
you know , i gotta get outta new york .
i gotta get outta school .
it's kathryn , isn't it?
i don't think i can beat her .
sebastian , do you believe in a higher power?
yeah .
do you believe that love conquers all?
yes .
do you believe in our love?
yeah .
it's the only thing keeping me together .
so you believe in our love?
yes , i believe in our love .
'cause i sure as hell don't .
what?
fucking idiot .
bravo .
i told you i could do it .
i should never have doubted you .
don't tell me you bought that virgin bullshit .
no , i saw you .
you were with your dad .
what he doesn't know can't hurt him .
i am the headmaster's daughter .
daddy's little angel must keep up appearances .
holy fuck .
oh , don't be such a baby .
you didn't really think you were gonna win , did you?
you're welcome to join us .
hmm?
two's company , three's a fuck load of fun .
well , if you can't beat 'em
who says you can't beat 'em?
share and share alike .
sebastian now you'll have something to write about .
danielle .
herzog .
oh , shit !
are you okay?
i'm fine .
oh , you really should try to be more careful .
thank you .
oh , my bike !
could we offer you a ride home?
sorry .
my mom said i'm not allowed to take rides from strangers .
oh , it's you .
i was just going to danielle's house .
i'll take care of the bike .
okay .
oh , thank you so much .
i owe you huge .
no problem .
it's debbie , right?
no , cherie .
whatever .
you know , debbie , has anyone ever told you : you could be a model?
really?
yeah .
it's too bad you're not sexy .
really?
bull !
i can be sexy .
uh huh .
all right .
show me sexy .
very nice .
that's my special place .
holy shit !
