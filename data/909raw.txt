the old man has finally lost it !

let's face it , paul , the guy comes from data processing .
terrific !
this is just terrific
you're being paranoid , paul .
these tests were conducted over a six month period , ... .. using a double blind format of eight overlapping demographic groups .
every region of the country was sampled .
the focus testing ... showed a solid base ... .. in the 9 to 11 year old bracket , ... .. with a possible carry over into the 12 year olds .
when you consider that gobots and transformers poll ...
.. 37 per cent market share , ...
i'm sorry . .. and that we are targeting the same area , ... .. i think that we should see one quarter of that .
and that is one fifth of the total revenue from all of last year .
excellent , paul .
thank you , thank you , thank you .
any questions?
not for me .
yes?
yes?
i don't get it .
what exactly ... don't you get?
it turns from a building into a robot , right?
precisely .
well , what's fun about that?
well , if you'd read your industry breakdown , ... .. you'd see that our success in the action figure area ... .. has climbed from 27 per cent to 45 per cent in the last two years .
there , that might help .
oh .
yes?
i i ...
i still don't get it .
what?
what don't you get , josh?
well ...
there's a million robots that turn into something .
this is a building that turns into a robot .
what's fun about playing with that?
this is a skyscraper .
well , couldn't it be , like , ... .. a robot that turns into ... into something like a ... like a bug or something?
a bug?
yeah .
like a big , prehistoric insect with claws ...
.. that could pick up a car and crush it .
in teresting .
a prehistoric transformer?
in teresting !
gentlemen ...
the robot turns into a bug?
uh , gentlemen , listen ...
he's got a very good idea here !
the robot turns into a bug !
what ...
.. different sizes ...
we could do ladybugs .
you could have 'em wreck buildings .
a building is inert , a bug moves !
it's got all kinds of possibilities .
this doesn't just happen .
this guy ...
he didn't just come to a meeting and say " bugs " .
uh ...
well done , josh .
well done .
oho !
oh , he is vicious !
he's not vicious .
don't kid yourself .
that man is a killer !
all he said was he didn't get it .
" i don't get it .
let's make it a bug .
he's going for the throat .
he's trying to eviscerate me .
did you see the look on macmillan's face?

amphibian?
he takes 10, 000 gl joes , ... .. slaps some gills on 'em , webs their feet , packages them in seaweed .
oh ...

oh , right and just yesterday , i was a schoolgirl with pigtails
why are you doing this?
there was a carnival ...
please !
i made a wish on the zoltar machine .
oh , stop it !
the zoltar machine had this bobbing head that looked just like a devil !
if you got a quarter in his mouth , you could make a wish .
i did !
i made a wish to be big .
what i'm trying to tell you is , i changed into a grown up , but i'm really just a kid !
fine , josh .
you're a kid .
look , i don't know what it is that you're trying to tell me , ... .. but we have a very big presentation to give tomorrow , so i'm gonna get some sleep .

sea point park , new york .
well?
yes?
they're waiting for you .
thanks .
see you around .
there's this flat screen on the inside with pictures on it .
you read it , and when you get to the bottom , you have to make a choice ... .. of what the character's gonna do if he's gonna fight the dragon , you push a button .
paul?
i don't get it .
well ...
paul !
it's a comic book ...
see , there's a computer chip inside , ... .. which stores the choices .
at the end of a page , you decide where the story goes .
that's the point .
terrific , susan .
the kid makes his own decision .
this is possible?
yeah !
in fact , it's a very simple program .
isn't that ...
isn't that right?
so what happens when you run out of choices?
that's the great thing .
you can sell different adventures .
just pop in a brand new disk , and you get a whole new set of options .
we could market this on a comic book rack .
mm hm .
i'll be right back .
how much would the unit cost?
well , our initial figure was around , uh ... seven ... .. around seven dollars , ... .. with a retail cost of about ... 18 . 95 .
well , you expect a kid to pay $19 for a comic book?
i think a kid ...
