hennessy , over the top .
close your eyes .
and whatever happens , don't look .

for your boss .

ma?
ma?
like i said , i found you something , didn't i , john?
didn't i?
what happened in there?
going to a lot of meetings , i see .
keeps the voices out so i can sleep .
i have to sleep , john .
i need some help , father .
you do?
from me?
what kind of?
hey , listen , i  that exorcism wasn't right .
listen to the ether .
anything unusual , you let me know .
come on , you don't need its protection .
it'll be like back in the day .
a few days .
okay .
okay .
for you , john .
john , why would you do that if you know it's not my car?
i told you to move it .
you did tell me to move it ... ... but if you'd said you were dropping a 300 pound mirror with a demon ... ... i would've moved it further , john .
take alvarado .
yeah , thank you .
i know what to take .
you ever think if you told me more now that maybe i could help out?
no?
nope .
nope?
of course it's a nope .
bless me , father , for i have sinned .
it's been ... ... two weeks since my last confession .
i killed a man today .
another one .
i didn't even see his face , i just ... ... pulled the trigger , and he went away .
most cops go 20 years without firing their guns .
why do i always know where these guys are?
where to aim , when to fire .
i'm wondering , is there something wrong with me , father?
something damned?
god has a plan for you .
he has a plan for us all .
you mustn't let your faith be overshadowed by guilt .
yeah , i'm trying .
i'm trying real hard .
isabel .
isabel .
things i've beaten .
things most people never even heard of .
and now i'm gonna be done in by this .
wouldn't be the first , john .
come on , les .
you saved me before , you can do it again , right?
this is aggressive .
twenty years ago , you didn't wanna be here .
now you don't wanna leave .
yeah , that's a good idea .
john , you really need to prepare .
make arrangements .
no need .
i already know exactly where i'm going .
morning .
good morning .
good morning .
detective .
no , no , no .
angela , wait .
you don't need to see this , okay?
no .
give us the room , please .
isabel .
she fell from the roof?
she jumped .
no .
look ... ... i know it's hard to accept .
she was sick .
isabel wouldn't kill herself .
angie .
she wouldn't kill herself .
detective .
period .
detective .
period !
angie , there were security cameras .
hold the door .
you going down?
not if i can help it .
a new case?
the big score?
the mother lode?
the one you've been waiting for?
humor me .
don't i always?
oh , yeah , that's much obliged .
thank you .
how you feeling , john?
so , what's new?
bullet shavings from the assassination attempt on the pope ... ... holy water ampoules from the river jordan ... ... and oh , you'll love this . screech beetle from amityville .
yeah , it's funny to you , but to the fallen , that's like nails on a chalkboard .
what is it , exactly , with you and bugs?
i just like them .
yeah .
who doesn't?
yeah , easy there , hero .
that's dragon's breath .
i thought you couldn't get it anymore .
yeah , well , i know a guy who knows a guy .
so , what's the action?
i just pulled a soldier demon out of a little girl .
looked like it was trying to come through .
yeah , i know how it sounds .
no , we're finger puppets to them , john ... ... not doorways .
they can work us , but they can't come through onto our plane .
check the scrolls anyway .
see if there's any precedent .
sure thing , john .
anything else?
wouldn't happen to have anything for a?
on the house .
all right , question .
how much longer do i have to be your slave , john?
you're not my slave , chas .
you're my very appreciated apprentice .
like tonto or robin .
or that skinny fellow with the fat friend .
right .
so then why don't i apprentice something besides driving , then , john?
john?
john .
i love our little talks , john .
may i take your coat , mr. constantine?
no , thanks , i'm not gonna be staying long .
how about you , ma'am?
oh , no , i'm not staying long either .
i really need to speak with him .
it's important .
first come , first served .
so you're rude no matter where you are .
father .
hi .
you have news .
yes .
yes , i spoke with the bishop .
i know what you want , son .
still keeping your all seeing eye on me , gabriel?
i'm flattered .
well , i could offer something ... ... about how a shepherd leads even the most wayward of his flock ... ... but it might sound disingenuous .
she has to have a catholic funeral , father .
she has to .
angela , it's still considered a mortal sin .
she didn't commit suicide .
the bishop believes otherwise .
you know the rules .
oh , rules .
father .
david .
this is isabel .
god was the only one she ever believed loved her .
please .
i'm sorry .
i've been seeing some unusual soul traffic lately .
you might consider giving me an extension .
i could do your side some good these days .
you still trying to buy your way into heaven?
what about the minions i've sent back?
that alone should guarantee my entry .
how many times have i told you?
that's not the way this works .
why , haven't i served him enough?
what does he want from me?
only the usual .
self sacrifice , belief .
oh , i believe , for chrissake .
no , no , you know .
and there's a difference .
you've seen .
i never asked to see .
i was born with this curse .
a gift , john .
one that you've squandered on selfish endeavors .
i'm pulling demons out of little girls .
who's that for?
everything you've ever done , you've only ever done for yourself .
to earn your way back into his good graces .
impossible rules , endless regulations ... ... who goes up , who goes down and why .
you don't even understand us .
you're the one who should go to hell , half breed .
why me , gabriel?
it's personal , isn't it?
i didn't go to church enough , i didn't pray enough ... ... i was 5 bucks short in the collection plate .
why?
you are going to die young ... ... because you smoked 30 cigarettes a day since you were 15 .
and you're going to go to hell ... ... because of the life you took .
you're fucked .
at least it's nice out .
he always had a rotten sense of humor .
and his punch lines are killers .
john !
constantine , it's raining !
john !
hey !
twenty two women were found buried in the assailant's back yard .
so much damage had been done to the bodies , police had to match ...
police report she had been physically penetrated ... ... over 100 times and buried alive . found locked in a storage freezer , his head severed and his organs ...
he stuffed holly's body into ...
the bodies ravished by the unknown ...
he used a small handsaw ...
had nearly decapitated ...
even his eyes were gouged out .
isabel .
i'm so sorry , izzy .
constantine .
dodson .
hello?
hello .
hello?
hey .
hey , buddy , got a light?
should've minded your own business , exorcist .
i know where you're going , john .
you're going to midnite's .
you're supposed to wait in the cab .
it's a haven for those who rise and fall .
i remember reading about this , john .
you read too much , kid .
it's a bar .
it's a bar?
it's a bar .
papa midnite is a crusader for good .
he swore the oath of neutrality .
john , the man's a legend .
yeah .
can you please get me into this bar , john , please?
i'm begging you , john , please?
sure , you can get in .
i can get in?
if you can get in .
if i can get?
it's a bear , though , right?
or two ducks in a cloud?
two frogs on a bench .
two frogs on a bench .
no , no , i'm with the guy you just
john !
john !
i'm with him , though .
rat in a dress .
of course it is .
rat in a dress .
i'm just testing .
i'm just testing .
don't get up .
you've been absent some time .
have you come here with relics to sell?
no , i'm out of that now .
i've been too busy .
perhaps peddling forgeries has ended up being bad for your health .
midnite , jesus ... ... i thought the thing was authentic .
i see now .
your health is bad for other reasons .
how long?
a few months , maybe a year .
i thought i heard thunder last night .
must have been satan's stomach growling .
you're the one soul he'd come up here himself to collect .
so i've heard .
well , i am most certain you did not come here ... ... for a sympathetic shoulder to cry on .
a demon just attacked me , right out in the open on figueroa .
they don't like you , john .
how many have you deported back to hell?
not some angry half breed , midnite .
a full fledged demon , here , on our plane .
clearly i do not have to remind you that is impossible .
and yesterday i saw a soldier demon ... ... trying to chew its way out through a little girl .
listen , john , demons stay in hell , angels in heaven ... ... the great dtente of the original superpowers .
thanks for the history lesson , midnite .
you've been a tremendous help .
now ... ... i need to use the chair .
john , forgetting the fact that it would almost certainly kill you ... ... you know i am neutral .
and as long as the balance is maintained , i take no sides .
before you were a bartender ... ... you were one witch doctor against , what , 30 ashgar?
and i  you were constantine .
the john constantine .
once .
this isn't the usual game , i can feel it .
something's coming .
spooky .
balthazar .
that expression alone has made my entire night .
i'll make your night .
i'll deport your sorry ass right where you stand , you half breed shit !
you know the rules of my house .
while here , you will abide by them .
johnny boy .
word is you're on your way down .
fresh meat .
finger licking good .
we have a meeting now , john .
what?
i didn't catch that .
welcome to my life .
mr. constantine .
i saw you  i remember .
and then i saw you at the  regular kismet .
i'd like to ask you a few questions , if that would be okay .
i'm not really in the talking mood right now .
well , maybe you could just listen then .
please?
always a catch .
my sister was murdered yesterday .
sorry to hear .
thanks .
she was a patient at ravenscar .
she jumped off the roof .
thought you said she was murdered .
yeah , well , isabel wouldn't have taken her own life .
yeah , what kind of mental patient kills herself?
that's just crazy .
look , i've heard your name around the precinct .
i know the circles you travel in .
the occult , demonology , exorcisms .
just before my sister was committed , she became deeply paranoid .
she started talking about demons , angels .
now , i think someone got to her , mr. constantine .
i think they brainwashed her into stepping off that roof .
some kind of legion or cult .
sounds like a theory , detective .
good luck .
i thought with your background , you could at least ... ... point me in the right direction .
yeah , okay , sure .
it wasn't a suicide .
my sister was a devout catholic .
do you understand that?
if she took her own life
her soul would go straight to hell ... ... where she'd be ripped apart over and over in screaming , brutal agony ... ... for all eternity .
that it?
that about right?
goddamn you .
detective .
what if i told you that god and the devil made a wager ... ... a kind of standing bet for the souls of all mankind?
i'd tell you to stay on your meds .
humor me .
no direct contact with humans .
that would be the rule .
just influence .
see who would win .
okay , i'm humoring you .
why?
who knows .
maybe just for the fun of it .
no telling .
oh , so it's fun .
it's fun when a man beats his wife to death , when a mother drowns her baby .
and you think the devil is responsible?
people are evil , mr. constantine .
people .
you're right .
we're born capable of terrible things .
then sometimes something else comes along and gives us just the right nudge .
well , this has been real educational ... ... but i don't believe in the devil .
you should .
he believes in you .
it's a power outage .
not likely .
what?
we should go .
now .
what is that?
wings .
maybe talons .
you're kidding .
of what?
something that's not supposed to be here .
that's really not going to help .
close your eyes .
why?
suit yourself .
demons stay in hell , huh?
tell them that .
don't worry .
happens to everyone the first time .
it's the sulfur .
sulfur .
what were those things?
demons .
scavengers of the damned .
no , no .
it's impossible .
yeah .
and i don't think they were after me .
you really believe she wouldn't commit suicide .
isabel?
never in a million years .
well , let's be sure .
let's see if she's in hell .
oh , was it supposed to be hot or cold?
in front of the chair .
i can't believe i'm doing this .
these are all isabel's things?
yeah .
how about the cat?
duck?
yeah , why?
duck .
oh , you think that's strange .
cats are good .
half in , half out anyway .
if this is some kind of spell or something ... ... don't you need candles and a pentagram for it to work?
why , do you have any?
this is crazy .
yes .
i need you to leave .
i'm sorry?
angela , please .
the apartment .
okay .
be careful with that cat .
god , i hate this part .
isabel .
constantine .
angela .
jesus .
constantine , what?
twins .
jesus .
what?
you were twins .
what did you say?
she killed herself .
what?
and she's damned for it .
how is this possible?
i need to eat .
hey !
hey , what are you doing in here?
relax , man .
slow down !
what the hell kind of place is this?
john .
when i was a kid , i could see things .
things humans aren't supposed to see .
things you shouldn't have to see .
my parents were normal .
they did what most parents would do .
they made it worse .
you think you're crazy long enough ... ... you find a way out .
you tried to kill yourself .
i didn't try anything .
officially , i was dead for two minutes .
but when you cross over ... ... time stops .
take it from me , two minutes in hell is a lifetime .
when i came back ... ... i knew ... ... all the things i could see were real .
heaven and hell are right here .
behind every wall , every window .
the world behind the world , and we're smack in the middle .
angels and demons can't cross over onto our plane .
so instead we get what i call half breeds .
the influence peddlers .
they can only whisper in our ears , but a single word can give you courage ... ... or turn your favorite pleasure into your worst nightmare .
those with the demon's touch ... ... like those part angel , living alongside us .
they call it the balance .
i call it hypocritical bullshit .
so when a half breed breaks the rules ... ... i deport their sorry ass straight back to hell .
i don't get them all ... ... but i've been hoping to get enough to ensure my ...
... retirement .
i don't understand .
i'm a suicide , angela .
when i die , the rules say i've got just one place to go .
you're trying to buy your way into heaven .
what would you do if you were sentenced to a prison ... ... where half the inmates were put there by you?
i guess god has a plan for all of us .
god's a kid with an ant farm , lady .
he's not planning anything .
when we were little ... ... isabel saw things too .
dodson .
guard spotted him groping the body , then he ran across the street .
came in here , and he had a go at the entire stock .
he drowned himself in alcohol in under a minute .
could've been a member of my fraternity .
hey , what the hell is he doing here?
he's okay .
why didn't you call me , you son of a bitch?
yes?
what do you mean?
what?
how?
got it .
bye .
i need to see where isabel died .
sances , ouija boards , channeling .
our father thought she was just trying to get attention .
she certainly did that .
she'd tell everyone about the things she said she saw .
she'd scare my mother half to death .
and then she stopped talking for almost a year .
so you had her committed .
yeah .
how long?
two weeks .
this time .
she'd get better , and then she'd get worse .
recently , a lot worse .
that symbol that was cut in the dead guy's hand ... ... does it have something to do with this?
i'm a cop , john , remember?
you don't walk off the roof of a building without leaving something behind .
and i showed you everything she left behind in that box , but feel free .
maybe she left something else .
not something a cop would find .
something just for you .
you were her twin , angela .
twins tend to think alike .
i'm not like my sister .
but you were once .
when you were kids .
when you'd spend every second with each other .
you'd start a sentence , she'd finish it .
you'd get hurt , she'd cry .
that was a long time ago .
that kind of bond doesn't just disappear .
there is nothing here .
hey .
come on .
she planned her death in this room .
she thought it up right here .
right where you're standing .
she knew you'd come .
she counted on you to see what she saw ... ... feel what she felt , know what she knew .
what did she do , angela?
how should i know?
what did she do , angela?
i don't know .
what would you do?
i don't know .
what did she do , angela?
you know what she did .
what did she do , angela?
you know what she did .
what are you afraid of?
what did she do?
what did she do?
i don't know !
when we were girls ... ... we would leave each other messages .
in light .
in breath .
on the windows .
john , there is no 17th act in corinthians .
corinthians goes to 21 acts in the bible in hell .
they have bibles in hell .
paints a different view of revelations .
says the world will not end by god's hand ... ... but be reborn in the embrace of the damned .
though if you ask me ... ... fire's fire .
16 : 29 , 16 : 30 .
oh , my , this is certainly not good .
the sins of the father would only be exceeded by the sins of the son .
whose son?
but he can't cross over , b.
impossible to cross over .
whose son?
god's son?
no , the other one .
devil had a son too .
here it is .
this is the sign of mammon ... ... the son of the devil .
well , hold on , it says here
