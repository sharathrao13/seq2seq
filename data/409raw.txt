what is it that makes a man a man?
is it his origins , the way things start?
or is it something else , something harder to describe?
for me , it all began in 1944 .
classified mission off the coast of scotland .
the nazis were desperate .
combining science and black magic ... ... they intended to upset the balance of the war .
i was 28 , already a paranormal advisor to president roosevelt .
i could never have suspected that what would transpire that night ... ... would not only affect the course of history ... ... but change my life forever .
all right , men , let's go .
move !
come on !
come on !
come on !
let's fan it out .
your men ... ... they'll need these .
are you a catholic?
yes .
among other things .
but that's hardly the point .
well , you're gonna need one of these .
i abhor the use of violence .
thank you .
i wouldn't want you to think me mad , sergeant whitman .
no , three days too late for that , professor broom .
all right , you guys , let's move , move , move , move !
come on boys , let's go !
this way !
left , right !
come on , men , let's get the lead out !
we're close !
you're wasting our time .
there's nothing here but sheep and rocks .
ruins , not rocks .
hold it right here !
the remains of trondham abbey , built on an intersection of ley lines ... ... the boundaries between our world and the others ...
what a load of crap !
hell , a week ago , i never even heard the word " parabnormal .
paranormal .
move it !
hold the line .
come on !
sweet jesus .
they must be here for the sheep .
the freak in the gas mask ...
karl ruprecht kroenen .
hitler's top assassin and head of the thule occult society .
if he's here , this is worse than i thought .
no matter what happens tonight ... ... this book will guide you back to me .
i will not leave you .
i grant you everlasting life ... ... youth ... ... and the power to serve me .
ilsa !
grigori !
it's time .
five years of research and construction , grigori .
five years !
the fhrer doesn't look kindly on failure .
there will be no failure , general .
i promised herr hitler a miracle .
i'll deliver one .
what i will do tonight can never be undone !
the seven gods of chaos !
our enemies will be destroyed !
and from the ashes ... ... a new eden will arise .
get down !
i was taking a picture .
you do that again and i'll carve you a new one .
listen , the portal is open .
do you understand?
we have to stop them .
go !
go !
go !
go !
look out !
get down !
it's almost over .
no , it's not .
the portal's been open for too long .
something may have come through .
have your men search the area thoroughly .
spread out over that way !
sir !
something up here !
he's gone .
for now .
when you said something came through ...
from where?
i don't see them !
do you really , really believe in hell?
there is a place , a dark place ... ... where ancient evil slumbers and waits to return .
grigori gave us a glance tonight .
grigori?
that's russian , right?
grigori efimovich rasputin .
rasputin?
come on !
occult adviser to the romanovs .
in 1916 , at a dinner in his honor ... ... he was poisoned , shot , stabbed , clubbed ... ... castrated and finally drowned .
and yet , we saw him here tonight .
professor broom .
careful .
be careful .
what the hell is that?
an ape?
no .
it was red .
bright red .
lower your light , you're scaring it .
what are you two shooting at?
a red ape !
no , it's not an ape .
it's got a big stone in its hand .
i think that is its hand .
look at the size of that whammer .
no , wait !
wait !
a blanket .
get me a blanket .
come on .
come on .
it's safe .
jump down .
come on .
jump down .
it's a boy .
it's just a baby boy .
move to the left .
there we were , an unready father for an unwanted child .
the boys gave him a name that very night .
in retrospect , perhaps not the most fortunate .
but nevertheless , a name we all came to use .
we called him hellboy .
look at the birdie .
speculation about the origins ...
evidence that hellboy ...
so , what is it exactly that you say this agency does?
i kid you not .
it hunts monsters .
the claim , of course , that this creature ... ... works for the fbi as a monster hunter .
what you seek is in there .
this is a sacred place .
give me my gold .
we shouldn't be here .
master .
your eyes .
what did they do to your eyes?
have you told him yet?
no .
we should .
malignant sarcoma .
in the lungs ... ... the spine ... ... liver .
approximately ... ... how long?
maybe six weeks .
i can arrange for hospitalization and pain management .
make the time more bearable .
no .
i'd rather be at home .
i have some arrangements to make .
for my son .
you can always get a second opinion .
that won't be necessary .
hurry up !
hurry up !
wait right here !
tom manning is the head of special operations at the fbl .
he joins pat in the studio tonight to go over the latest hellboy sighting .
there .
that's the tail .
and these are the horns .
i have a question .
in the pictures of aliens , ufo , the yeti , hellboy ... ... why is it they're always out of focus?
why don't you tell us ... ... about the bureau of paranormal research and defense?
i wanna tell you , i wanna tell the american public one thing .
now , this bureau for the ...
paranormal research and defense .
there is no such thing .
waste management services "?

my name's broom .
professor trevor broom .

agent john t. myers , kansas city , '76 .

the day that abraham lincoln died .
hence , abe sapien .
rotten eggs .
a delicacy .
abe loves them .
how does he know so much about me?
abe possesses a unique frontal lobe .
unique . " that's a word you'll hear frequently around here .
sir , where am i , exactly?
in the absence of light , darkness prevails .
there are things that go bump in the night , agent myers .
make no mistake about that .
and we are the ones who bump back .
1937 , hitler joins the thule society ... ... a group of german aristocrats obsessed with the occult .
1938 , he acquired the spear of longinus ... ... which pierced the side of christ .
he who holds it becomes invincible .
hitler's power increases tenfold .
1943 , president roosevelt decides to fight back .
the bureau of paranormal research and defense is born .
1958 , the occult wars finally come to an end ... ... with the death of adolf hitler .
1945 , you mean .
hitler died in '45 .
did he , now?
myers , this is agent clay .
take his lead .
he'll make the introductions .
you're not coming?
i handpicked you from a roster of over 70 academy graduates .
make me proud .
they're not speaking .
professor broom had him grounded .
grounded?
who's grounded?
okay .
you saw the fish guy , right?
oh , yeah .
that was weird .
yeah .

well , come on in .
meet the rest of the family .
he gets fed six times a day .
he's got a thing for cats .
you'll be his nanny , his keeper , his best friend .
he never goes out unsupervised .
who?
i hate those comic books .
they never get the eyes right .
hellboy .
he's real .
60 years old by our count .
but he doesn't age like we do .
think reverse dog years .
he's barely out of his 20s .
what's with the hair , clay?

we're here at the machen library ... ... where just hours ago , an alarm was triggered .
the n. y. p. d. has yet to issue a statement .
we've got swat vans , paramedics .

and now here comes a garbage truck .
a large garbage truck .

we don't take hints .
civilians in bedroom .
okay , guys , let's sync up our locators .

red and blue are coming in .
1900 hours , an alarm was tripped .
a large entity , type 5 , reported .
very aggressive .
six guards dead .
i thought we checked this place .
fakes and reproductions .
apparently , not everything was fake .
father .
the entity is still in there .
video surveillance shows a 16th century statue was destroyed .
st. dionysius the areopagite .
who wards off demons .
exactly .
the statue , however , was hollow .
a reliquary .
a prison .
the vatican deemed its occupant dangerous enough ... ... to include it on the list of avignon , of which , by the way , we hold a copy .
perfect job for these babies .
made them myself .
holy water , clove leaf , silver shavings , white oak .
the works .
behind this door , a dark entity .
evil , ancient and hungry .
oh , well .
let me go in and say hi .
you better hit the books , brother blue .
we'll definitely need more info on this one .
hey , no one goes with him?
jesus .

salt gathered from the tears of a thousand angels .
restraining the essence ... ... of sammael , the hellhound .
the seed of destruction .
this i can promise , sammael .
for each one of you that falls ... ... two shall arise .
professor .
i'm all right .
professor .
you ...
you are very sick .
i don't want hellboy to know .
sixty years ago , they tried to destroy the world .
they're back .
in my lifetime , they're back ... ... to finish the job .
we miss you at the bureau .
abe's crazier every day .
father's still mad at me .
come back , liz .
come back .
no .
no , h. b.
no , not this time .
i don't like it here ... ... but i haven't had an episode in months .
and you know what?
i'm learning to control it .
i'm learning where it comes from .
for the first time in my life ... ... i'm not afraid .
looks like your ride is here .
have escort stand by .
the nanny squad .
hey , stop .
wait .
wait .
sir , may i go first?
hang on a minute .
he barely knows him .
then he should make it his business to change that .
listen , h. b ... ... i've got a chance out here .
so if you really care about me ...
... you won't come back .
yeah ... ... i gotta go too .
lots to do .
what took you so long?
come on , time to go home .
tape you up .
what are you , a boy scout?
nope , i never was .
well , you could have fooled me .
hey , red .
oh , god .
you've lost a lot of blood .
this is nothing .
you know what'll kill me , don't you?
okay , red , let's get you home .
come on .
you were burned by some organic acid .
i'm lucky that way .
i worry about you .
me?
well ... ... i won't be around forever , you know .
damn !
could you please be a little careful?
big baby .
how long was it latched onto you?
i don't know .
about five seconds .
professor , look .
is it bad?
touched you five seconds , laid three eggs .
didn't even buy me a drink .
the stinger detaches itself from the tongue and injects the eggs .
they are very sensitive to heat and light .
they need a humid , dark environment to breed .
did you ever lose track of him?
well , let's see .
there was that moment when i had the train on top of my head .
we can't risk it .
tomorrow you'll go back to the tracks with a group of agents .
search the whole place top to bottom .
find those eggs and destroy them .
elizabeth sherman .
i don't like the term " fire starter .
i just don't .
and " pyrokinesis " sounds like some psychosis or something .
i don't know .
maybe that's right .
not being able to let go .
it's scary .
i black out after each episode .
sometimes for hours .
you hear about so and so ... ... who just lost control and just exploded .
well , they're lucky it isn't true .
with me , it is .
my master is calling your name now , my girl .
you must return to the child .
so once again ... ... dream ... ... of fire .
hey , freak !
get back here , freak !
let's get her !
get her !
get her , guys !
watch this !
freak !
oh , no !
not again .
oh , no !
somebody !
help me !
help me , somebody !
help me !
how many buildings does she have to burn down?
she belongs here .
that's not what she feels .
she may never feel it .
it's her choice .
professor , the girl you're ...
professor , that girl you're talking about ...
hey , boy scout ... ... think twice .
no , listen , i read her file .
" read her file . " she blames herself ... ... for that explosion in pittsburgh .
look , i think i can help .
i could talk to her .
i think i could bring her back .
just what was it that landed you this job pushing " pamcakes , " huh?
what was it?
punctuality?
the way you part your hair?
what is your area of expertise?
he doesn't want me with him .
i know that much .
you're doing fine .
no , i'm not .
look , he respects clay , not me .
i'm really sorry , okay?
i'm not your guy .
i'm dying , agent myers .
like any father , i worry about him .
in medieval stories , there is often a young knight ... ... who is inexperienced ... ... but pure of heart .
come on .
look , i am not pure of heart .
yes , you are .
rasputin is back for him .
what i ask of you ... ... is to have the courage to stand by him when i am gone .
he was born a demon .
can't change that .
but you will help him ... ... in essence ... ... to become a man .
pull that down .
she was making great progress ... ... and now this .
we'll be closed for months .
and it put a big dent in our thorazine supply .
she's been like this since it happened .
are you sure you want to go in?
miss sherman?
i'm agent myers , fbl .
miss sherman?
can i call you liz?
it's a beautiful name .
sixty percent of all the women in the world are named liz .
well , it's impressive by my standards .
my name's john .
john t. myers .
dr. broom asked me to invite you back to the bureau .
no special precautions , no security escorts .
just you and me in a taxi like regular folks .
that doesn't sound like him .
well , miss sherman , he's asking you back ... ... but it's entirely your choice , you know?
choice , huh?
that's cute .
i've quit the bureau 13 times .
i always go back .
where else would i go?
over here .
you said those eggs need it dark and humid?
well , they hit the jackpot .
the subway lines , they all converge right around here .
right below us is the old vandeveer reservoir .
it was abandoned in the mid 30s .
there's a pulse .
there .
a cistern on the other side .
most of the eggs are there .
there's no way in .
we should go back and request a special permit , type 2 ...
you guys coming or what?
we lead a charmed life .
here you are , doctor .
this should cover your tail fin .
reliquary .
straight from the vatican .
a bone from st. dionysius .
looks like a pinkie .
remind me why i keep doing this .
rotten eggs and the safety of mankind .
this doesn't really look like doll's hair .
be honest , red .
what do you think?
i'm thinking about doing it myself .
hey , you guys find anything?
no eggs yet , red .
what , are you on a lunch break?
nothing here .
red's on the move .
i'll cover him .
damn it , red .
hey , it's abe .
oh , god .
bring your toy over here .
oh , man .
oh , jesus .
there's only one .
i'll fry him quick .
two .
there were two .
red?
red .
come in , red .
what's your 20?
i got no signal .
where the hell are you?
it's like swiss cheese in here .
sit tight , pal , i'm on him .
