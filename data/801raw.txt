mr. frank .
mr. frank?
kraler .
mr. kraler .
miep .
my good friends .
it is so good to see you home .
we had heard nothing .
i'm alone .
you must come home with us ... ... and rest now .
you must stay with us .
no , i can't stay in amsterdam .
mr. frank , this is your home .
amsterdam is your home .
it has too many memories .
everywhere there's something , miep .
everywhere .
even seeing you and mr. kraler ....
i shouldn't talk to you like this , after all you did .
why , we'd do it again .
everything's gone .
the book ....
they took everything , except some papers .
we saved your letters and papers .
please burn them .
burn everything .
i told her ... ... if i got back here , i'd find her book .
anne's diary?
it's where she left it .
the 9th of july , 1 942 . " 1 942 .
is it possible , miep?
only three years ago?
dear diary , since you and i are to be great friends ... ... i will start by telling you all about myself .
my name is anne frank .
i am 1 3 years old .
i was born in germany , but since my family is jewish ... ... we emigrated to holland when hitler came to power .
things went well for us until the war came and the german occupation .
then things got very bad for the jews .
you could not do this and you could not do that .
we had to wear yellow stars .
i had to turn in my bike .
i couldn 't go to a dutch school anymore .
i couldn 't go to the movies or ride in an automobile ... ... or even on a streetcar .
and a million other things .
but somehow , we children still managed to have fun .
this morning , father woke me at 5 : 00 ... ... and told me to hurry and get dressed .
we were going into hiding .
i was to put on as many clothes as i could .
it would look too suspicious if we walked along carrying suitcases .
we were going to disappear ... ... vanish into thin air .
i'm living a great adventure .
three other people were coming in with us .
father knew them .
we had never met them .
something's happened .
they had a 3 mile walk .
mother .
they've been arrested , i know .
will you stop that?
mother .
father .
we're here .
you see?
mr. van daan .
hello .
mrs. van daan .
mr. frank .
peter .
there were too many green police on the streets .
we took the long way around .
did you introduce yourself?
my daughter anne .
my wife , edith .
margot .
mr. and mrs. van daan .
oh , and this is our son , peter .
so , now , please let us take off some of these clothes .
good morning .
good morning , mr. kraler .
morning , mr. kraler .
mr. frank .
you're all here .
that is good .
we hoped to have everything in order .
please , don't even think of it .
we'll have leisure to arrange everything ourselves .
brought sandwiches for lunch .
thank you , miep .
the canned goods are here , and your beans and potatoes .
i'll get you ration books this afternoon .
ration books?
if they see our names on ration books , they'll know we're here .
don't worry .
it won't be your names that'll be on them .
father !
the westertoren !
anne !
no !
you must never touch a curtain .
never .
no one must ever touch a curtain , day or night .
if someone on the streets should look up or someone should see ... ... we would be lost .
remember , it's not only our lives at stake ... ... but miep's and mr. kraler's .
you have 1 3 minutes to get settled .
thank you .
miep or i will be up each day to bring you food and news .
come , miep , we must go .
goodbye .
goodbye , mr. kraler .
how can we thank you?
i never thought i'd live to see the day when a man like mr. frank ... ... would have to go into hiding .
when you think of it ....
goodbye .
thank you , mr. kraler .
goodbye .
anne !
it's all right , i have on three more .
excuse me , mr. frank .
what do they mean , " 1 3 minutes "?
before workmen come .
now ... ... while the men are in the building below , we must be quiet .
every sound can be heard down there , in the offices and in the workrooms too .
the men come at about 8 : 30 .
they leave at about 5 : 30 .
so to be perfectly safe , from 8 a . m . until 6 p . m ... ... we must move about up here only when absolutely necessary ... ... and then in stockinged feet .
we must not speak above a whisper or run any water .
we cannot use the sink or even , forgive me , the w. c.
the pipes go down through the workrooms .
no trash must ever be
no trash , which might reveal someone's living here .
not even a potato peeling .
we must burn everything in the stove at night .
this is the way that we must live until it is over , if we are to survive .
until it is over .
after 6 : 00 , we can move about .
we can talk and laugh ... ... have our supper , read , play games , just as we would at home .
now it would be wise if we all went to our rooms ... ... and were settled before 8 : 00 .
mr. and mrs. van daan , you're upstairs .
i regret there's no place up there for peter .
but he'll be here , near us .
and where am l?
you and margot will be in there .
excuse me , mr. frank .
yes?
where do you sleep?
this room is our bedroom .
oh , no , no .
you take the upstairs .
we'll sleep down here .
i've thought this out .
it's the best arrangement .
the only arrangement .
edith?
you must have some rest , dear .
you didn't close your eyes last night .
now , go in the girls 'room .
well , how about anne?
i feel fine .
i'm going to help father .
this way , mrs. van daan .
excuse me .
up here .
mr. frank?
mr. frank?
peter?
i have time to get water for my cat?
you've a cat?
go ahead , but be quick .
you only have about five minutes .
he couldn't live without that cat .
i didn't know you had a cat .
i love cats .
what's its name?
mouschi .
what is it?
mouschi .
a him or her?
it's a tom .
it doesn't like strangers .
then i'll have to stop being a stranger .
ls he fixed?
no .
you ought to have him fixed , to keep him from fighting .
what a nice cat .
where do you go to school?
jewish secondary .
that's where margot and i go .
yeah , i know .
i've never seen you around .
i used to see you sometimes .
you did?
why didn't you ever come over?
oh , i don't know .
i'm sort of a lone wolf .
you can't be a lone wolf here .
i wonder what our friends will say when we don't show up today .
i had a date with sanne .
do you know sanne de vries?
no .
sanne's my best friend .
she's thin like me .
anne and sanne , the skinny bananas .
you took off your star .
that's right .
you can't do that .
they'll arrest you if you go out without your star .
who's going out?
help me .
i'm helping .
what are you going to do with it?
burn it .
it's funny , i don't think i could burn mine .
i don't know why .
you couldn't?
something they make you wear so they can kick you around .
i know .
but after all ... ... it is the star of david , isn't it?
annele , it's almost 8 : 00 .
don't you wanna sit with us?
it'll be a long day .
no , thanks .
this is fine .
you won't forget to take off your shoes , will you?
peter ... ... it's nice to have you with us .
yes , mr. frank .
see you later .
did you know that he went to the same school that?
it's comforting that mr. kraler and his secretary ... ... are down there below us , in the office .
our protectors , we call them .
i asked father what would happen to them ... ... if anyone found out they were hiding us .
father said they would suffer the same fate that we would .
we are over an old spice factory .
you can smell the spices all through the building .
i read a tale of two cities through in that first day .
it is a far , far better thing i do ... ... than i have ever done .
it is a far , far better rest that i go to ... ... than i have ever known .
the end .
it was the saddest book i ever read .
it is us , miep and kraler .
good evening , mr. kraler .
good evening , miep .
good evening , annele .
oh , mr. frank .
yes?
this is the box you asked for .
thanks .
oh , my dear friends , you were all so quiet up here .
i thought you'd gone out for a walk .
can you imagine me?
i didn't talk .
i hardly moved for one whole day .
wish they could hear that at school .
mouschi !
mouschi !
peter !
peter .
mouschi .
annele !
annie !
annele !
peter , i'm warning you .
please , quiet .
margot .
margot !
what are these?
you don't have to whisper now .
there you are .
he's such a nice cat .
thank you .
you're welcome .
annele .
there's a box there .
will you open it , please?
know how i'm going to think of it here?
as a boarding house , a very peculiar boarding house .
father , my film stars !
i was wondering where they were .
and queen wilhelmina .
how wonderful .
there's something more .
go on , look further .
a diary .
i've never had a diary .
and i've always wanted one .
a pencil?
i'm going downstairs to get a pencil .
anne , no !
there's nobody down there .
doesn't matter .
don't go beyond that door .
never?
never .
i'm sorry , anne , it isn't safe .
i see .
it'll be hard , i know that .
but always remember there are no walls , no locks ... ... no bolts that anyone can put on your mind .
as a matter of fact , just between us , annele ... ... being here has certain advantages .
for instance ... ... remember that battle with your mother about overshoes?
you said you'd rather die than wear overshoes .
remember?
what happened?
in the end , you had to wear them .
now , for as long as we are here , you won't have to wear overshoes .
isn't that good?
and the piano .
you won't have to practice it .
i tell you ... ... this is going to be a fine life for you .
it's an odd idea for someone like me to keep a diary .
not only because i have never done so before ... ... but because it seems to me , neither i , nor for that matter anyone else ... ... will be interested in the unbosomings of a 13 year old schoolgirl .
still , what does that matter?
i want to write , but more than that ... ... i want to bring out all kinds of things ... ... that lie buried deep in my heart .
first of all , i expect i should be describing ... ... what it's like to go into hiding .
but i don 't really know yet myself .
i only know it's funny never to be able to go outdoors .
never to breathe fresh air .
never to run and shout and jump .
wednesday , the 23rd of september , 1942 .
the news of the war is good .
stalingrad is still holding out .
the russian offensive continues in the moscow area .
it's safe now .
the last workman has left .
whee !
anne !
l 'm first for the w. c.
six o'clock , margot .
school is over .
where are my shoes?
have you seen my shoes?
what shoes?
you're gonna be sorry .
i am?
annie , dear .
wait till i get you .
i'm waiting .
stop !
peter !
annie !
peter !
peter , where are you going?
gonna give mouschi his dinner .
peter !
annie , dear ... ... you shouldn't play like that with pete .
that's not dignified .
who wants to be dignified?
i don't wanna be dignified !
you complain i don't treat you like a grownup , but when i do , you resent it .
i only want some fun .
i don't know what's the matter with that boy .
give him a little time .
he isn't used to girls .
time?
isn't two months time?
i could cry .
and what about miep?
she's usually so prompt .
margot , come and dance with me .
i've got more work to do , anne .
you know , we're going to forget how to dance .
when we get out , we won't remember a thing .
where is peter?
where would he be?
with his cat .
he hasn't finished his lessons , has he?
peter .
peter !
what is it?
your mother says to come out .
i'm giving mouschi his dinner .
you know what your father says about wasting time with that cat .
i haven't looked at him since lunch .
i'm only telling you .
i'll feed him .
you stay out of here .
and i mean out .
is that any way for you to talk to your little girlfriend?
mother , i asked you ...
... would you please not say that?
look , he's blushing .
he's blushing .
please , i'm not , but
leave me alone .
like it's something to be ashamed of .
nothing to be ashamed of to have a girlfriend .
that's crazy .
she's only 1 3 .
so what?
you're 1 6 .
it's just perfect .
your father's 1 0 years older than me .
mr. frank , i warn you ... ... if this war lasts much longer , we're gonna be related .
mazel tov .
i haven't seen my cat since lunch .
i'm giving mouschi his dinner .
my little mouschi .
i couldn't live without my precious mouschi .
you wonderful cat , you .
all right , miss quack quack .
what's that?
miss quack quack !
you !
you talk so much they call you miss quack quack .
you're the most intolerable boy i ever met !
quack , quack , quack !
quack !
ooh !
anne , dear , you're hot .
you're warm .
are you all right?
mother , please .
you don't have a fever , do you?
no .
you know we can't call a doctor here , ever .
there's only one thing to do , watch carefully .
prevent an illness before it comes .
let me see your tongue .
mother , this is perfectly absurd .
anne , dear , don't be such a baby .
let me see your tongue .
otto .
anne , you hear your mother , don't you?
come on , open up .
quack .
annie .
otto .
anne .
you're all right .
i think there's nothing the matter with our anne that a ride on her bike ... ... or a visit with her friend sanne de vries wouldn't cure .
isn't that so , anne?
i keep wishing that peter was a girl instead of a boy .
then i'd have someone to talk to .
with all the boys in the world ... ... why did i have to get locked up with him?
is it someone?
ls it miep?
it's strange we don't hear .
maybe she got hurt .
she'll come .
i wish she'd get here .
i'm going crazy without cigarettes .
anne , you got " excellent " in your history paper ...
... and " very good " in latin .
yes , but how about algebra?
well , i have a confession to make .
up until now , i managed to stay ahead of you in algebra .
today , you caught up with me .
we'll leave it to margot to correct .
lsn't algebra vile , father?
vile .
how did i do?
excellent , of course .
anne , please .
your french composition today , margot , was just wonderful .
mrs. van daan , may i try it on?
no , annie .
it's all right , really .
but please be careful with it .
my father gave me this coat the year before he died .
he always bought me the best money could buy .
mrs. van daan , did you have a lot of boyfriends before you were married?
annie , that's a personal question .
it's not courteous to ask personal questions .
i don't mind .
anneke , our house was always swarming with boys .
when i was a young girl  oh , no , not again .
shut up !
one summer , we had a big house in hilversum .
the boys ....
the boys would come buzzing around like bees around a jam pot .
when i was 1 7 ....
well , we were wearing short skirts then , and i had such good looking legs .
i still have .
i may not be as pretty as i used to be ... ... but i still have my legs .
how about it , mr. frank?
all right , all right .
we see them .
i'm not asking you , i'm asking mr. frank .
mother , for heaven sakes .
oh , i embarrass you too , do l?
let me tell you something .
i only hope the girl you marry has as good .
anneke , my father used to worry with all the boys hanging around .
'remember , mr. so and so , remember , i am a lady . '
look at you , talking that way with her .
don't you know she puts it in her diary?
so what if she does?
i'm only telling the truth .
haven't you finished?
no .
oh , the thinker .
leave him alone .
i'm a dunce .
a hopeless case .
don't talk like that .
it's just you haven't got anyone to help you ... ... iike father helps anne and me .
but if l well , if we could help ....
what about it , peter?
would you like to study with us?
shall we make our school coeducational?
thanks , yes .
mr. frank .
yes?
you are an angel , an absolute angel .
why didn't i meet you before i met that one there?
i think it might be better if you went into your room , peter , to work .
excuse me .
peter , you listen to mr. frank .
mr. frank is a highly educated man .
it's after 8 : 00 .
where are they?
at least one of them should've come .
they'll come .
don't worry .
don't tell me .
i know something's wrong .
isn't it bad enough here without you sprawling all over?
if you didn't smoke , you wouldn't be so irritable .
am i smoking?
you already smoked all the cigarettes .
miep only brought me one package .
it's a filthy habit ...
... and this is a good time to break it .
oh , stop it .
please .
you're smoking up all our money .
will you shut up? !
and what are you staring at?
i never heard grownups quarrel like that before .
i thought only children quarreled .
this isn't a quarrel , it's a discussion .
i never heard children so rude before .
i , rude?
yes !
annie , drink your milk .
you've been spoiled .
what you need is a good spanking .
remember , mr. so and so , i am a lady .
you're the most aggravating why aren't you nice and quiet ... ... iike your sister , margot?
why do you show off all the time?
let me give you a little advice .
men don't like that in a girl .
do you know that?
a man likes a girl who'll listen to him .
a girl who cooks and sews and cleans .
i'd cut my throat first .
i'd open my veins .
i am going to be remarkable .
i'm going to paris ...
... to study music and art .
yeah , yeah .
i'm going to be an actress or a writer or a dancer .
look what you did .
i'm sorry .
you clumsy little fool !
my father gave me this coat !
i'm so sorry .
all ruined , and what do you care?
you ruined it !
i could kill you !
i could just kill you !
petronella .
petronella , it's only a coat .
only a coat .
anne , you must not behave in that way .
it was an accident .
anyone can have an accident .
i don't mean that .
i mean the answering back .
you must not answer back .
they're our guests .
you don't hear margot getting into arguments with them .
try to be like margot .
and have them walk all over me the way they do her?
no , thanks .
i don't know what happens to you , annie .
if i had ever talked to my mother as you talk to me ....
things have changed , mother .
people aren't like that anymore .
yes , mother .
no , mother .
anything you say , mother .
i've got to fight things out for myself .
make something of myself .
it isn't necessary to fight to do it .
margot doesn't
margot . " that's all i hear .
why aren't you like margot?
everything she does is right , and everything i do is wrong .
you're all against me , and you worst of all .
i don't know how we can go on living this way .
i can't say a word to annie , she flies at me .
you know anne .
in a half an hour , she'll be laughing and joking .
and them .
i told your father it wouldn't work with two families .
but no , no , he had to ask them .
shh .
every time i hear that sound , my heart stops .
it's miep .
father .
yes?
it's miep .
here's your list .
thank you .
is it miep?
yes .
at last , i'll have some cigarettes .
miep's here .
i can't tell you how sorry i am about the coat .
don't worry .
hello .
miep .
mr. kraler .
when mr. kraler comes , the sun begins to shine .
dirk has had to leave .
dirk is miep's fianc .
he had to go into hiding in the country to escape a labor call up ... ... but he has let me have the radio for you .
he shouldn't have .
it was too dangerous .
look !
our blessed radio .
it gives us our eyes and ears out into the world .
we listen to the german station only for good music .
the axis forces in the western ....
and we listen to the bbc for hope .
man on radlo : ceaseless attacks by land and air forces are now in full retreat .
the 8th army continues to advance .
it's good .
all right , peter .
now , let's see what they have to say about the nazis , huh?
berlin .
must we listen?
all right , peter , that's enough .
the green police , they've found us .
hmm .
hm .
hm?
hm .
this way , mr. dussel .
it's kraler .
and miep .
please open .
bless them .
they're here .
kraler?
and miep , yes .
open , please .
well , we had a visitor last night .
we had a visitor last night .
y es , yes .
a thief .
it was a thief?
did you hear him?
yes .
he was right under you .
in the office right under here .
we did not know .
we thought it was the police .
are you sure , miep?
you were , of course , quiet?
we didn't move .
we hardly breathed all night .
that is good .
it was close .
too close .
he went through everything , the desk and the files .
and he found the safe , but he could not get it open .
he's looking for our ration card supply from the underground .
somebody knows .
they are in that safe .
they'll come back .
you should get rid of that safe .
get it out of here .
burglars do not come back .
the safe is gone .
jokes , yeah .
mr. frank , i must talk to you .
of course .
maybe we should get rid of the radio .
put it in the stove .
burn it .
if the green police found that radio ....
then they'd find her diary .
we'll burn that too .
not my diary .
my diary goes , i go with it .
where is it?
mr. van daan .
if they find us , they might as well find the diary , the radio ....
usually , i try to bring good news .
yes , i know .
but something has happened .
a man came to me .
he told me that he has a jewish friend , a dentist .
he begged me , could i find him a hiding place?
so i have come to you .
it is a terrible thing to ask of you , living the way you are ...
... but could you take him in?
well , of course we will .
his name is jan dussel .
dussel .
i think i know him .
i think it's fine to have him .
thank you .
but , otto , where are we going to put him?
where?
there's so little food as it is  we can stretch the food a little .
he can have my bed .
no , thank you .
margot will move in with us , and he can have her bed .
i'll get my things out .
mr. dussel .
don't bump your head .
come in , mr. dussel .
this is mr. frank .
mr. otto frank?
yes .
let me have your things , please .
thank you , mr. frank .
i leave you in good hands .
mr. dussel , i must return your coat .
what can i say to thank you?
mr. kraler and miep ... ... they're our lifeline .
without them , we couldn't live .
please .
you make us seem very heroic .
it isn't that at all .
we simply don't like the nazis .
i know , i know .
nobody's going to tell us dutchmen what to do with our damn jews .
we'll be up tomorrow , see if they're treating you right .
goodbye .
goodbye , mr. kraler .
goodbye , mr. dussel .
goodbye , miep .
welcome , mr. dussel .
thank you .
this is my wife , edith .
mr. and mrs. van daan .
their son , peter .
my daughters , margot and anne .
hello , anne .
how do you do?
margot .
how do you do?
please , mr. dussel , sit down .
thank you .
i'm dreaming , i know it .
mr. otto frank here .
you're not in switzerland , then?
someone said that you had escaped .
and you've been here all this time?
ever since july .
did mr. kraler warn you you won't get much to eat here?
you can imagine .
three ration cards among the seven of us .
now you make eight .
mr. van daan , you don't realize what's happening outside ... ... that you should warn me of a thing like that .
you don't realize what's going on , right here in amsterdam .
every day , hundreds of jews disappear .
they surround the block .
they search house by house .
every day , children come home from school to find their parents gone .
hundreds are being deported .
people that you and i know : the hallensteins , the wessels .
oh , no .
come to the station on such and such a day and hour .
bring only what you can carry .
if you don't , they come drag you from your home ... ... and ship you off to mauthausen , the death camp .
we didn't know that things had got so much worse .
forgive me for speaking so .
do you know the de vries?
they're gone .
sanne and i are in the same class .
sanne is my best my best friend .
she returned home from school to find her parents gone .
she was alone for two days , and then they came and took her away .
gone?
yes , with all the others .
oh , no .
people named meyerberg , they lived near us .
do you know?
we should put this off .
i'm sure mr. dussel would like to get settled .
would you take mr. dussel to his room now?
if you'll come with me , mr. dussel .
forgive me if i haven't expressed my gratitude .
this has been such a shock to me .
i always thought of myself as dutch .
i was born in holland .
my father was born in holland , and my grandfather .
and now , after all these years ....
if you will excuse me .
it's so different from what mr. kraler tells us .
mr. kraler says that things are improving .
i like it better the way kraler tells it .
good night .
say good night !
good night , mother .
good night , mr. frank .
good night .
do you have any children , mr. dussel?
no , i never married .
have you no family at all?
no one .
how dreadful .
you must be terribly lonely .
i'm used to it .
i don't think i could ever get used to it .
didn't you even have a pet?
a cat or a dog?
no .
no , no , i have an allergy to furbearing animals .
gives me asthma .
oh , dear .
what?
peter has a cat .
he has?
he has it here?
yes .
we hardly ever see it .
he keeps it in his room all the time .
yeah .
i'm sure it'll be all right .
well , i hope so .
yes .
i hope i won't be too much of a bother to you , mr. dussel .
no .
i seem to be able to get everyone's back up .
oh , i always get along very well with young people .
my patients all bring their children to me ... ... because they know i get along well with them .
so don't you worry about that .
thank you , mr. dussel .
good night .
i'll be back .
good night , mr. dussel .
be careful .
sanne .
sanne?
sanne !
save me !
save me !
no , no !
no !
don't take me !
stop it !
stop it !
save me .
hush , annie , hush .
it's all right .
it's all right .
please , mr. dussel , turn on the light .
it was just a dream .
you're here , safe , you see?
something must be done with that child .
yelling like that .
who knows who might be in the street?
she's endangering our lives .
mr. dussel , after all , anne is not exactly a trained frontline soldier .
please , mr. dussel , go back to bed .
she'll be herself in a minute or two , won't you , annie?
go back to bed .
hmph .
excuse me .
i'm going to the w. c. , the one room where there's peace .
go back to bed now .
would you like some water?
was it a very bad dream?
perhaps if you told me?
i'd rather not talk about it .
try to sleep , then .
i'll sit right here beside you .
you don't have to .
but i'd like to stay with you .
very much , really .
i'd rather you didn't .
good night
you'll be all right?
there's nothing that you want?
will you please ask father to come?
yes , of course , anne , dear .
she asked for you .
edith ....
go to her , otto .
she's still trembling with fear .
she wants nothing of me .
she pulled away when i leaned down to kiss her .
they broke down the door and tried to drag me out , the way they did sanne .
anne .
it's just a phase .
all girls turn to their fathers at this age .
they give all their love to their fathers .
you weren't like this .
you didn't shut me out .
so ....
do you want me to read to you?
no , just sit with me for a minute .
was i awful?
do you think anyone outside heard me?
no .
now , lie down quietly so .
like this .
now try to sleep .
i'm a terrible coward .
i'm so disappointed in myself .
i think i'm really grown up ... ... and then something happens , and i run to you like a baby .
i love you , father .
i don't love anyone but you .
annele .
annele .
it's true .
you're the only one i love .
i've been thinking about it for a long time .
it's fine .
it's fine to have you tell me that you love me ... ... but i'd be much happier if you said that you loved your mother as well .
she needs your help so much .
your love .
we have nothing in common .
she doesn't understand me .
whenever i try to explain my views on life , she asks me if i'm constipated .
you hurt her very much just now .
she's crying .
she is in there crying .
oh , father , i was horrible , wasn't l?
what's the matter with me?
tell me .
don't say it's just a phase .
help me .
there is so little that we parents can do to help our children , annie .
we can only try to set a good example , point the way .
the rest you must do yourself .
i'm trying .
really , i am .
every night , i think back over all the things i did that day that were wrong .
like putting the wet mop in mrs. van daan's bed .
and now this with mother .
i say to myself , " that was wrong .
and i make up my mind never to do that again .
never .
i may do something worse , but i'll never do that again .
i have a nicer side , father ... ... but i'm scared to show it .
i'm afraid people will laugh at me .
so the mean anne comes to the outside ... ... and the good anne stays in the inside .
and i keep on trying to switch them around ... ... have the good anne outside ... ... and the bad anne inside .
it would be what i'd like to be .
and might be .
if only ....
she's asleep .
thursday , the 29th of october , 1942 .
mr. dussel and i had a great battle yesterday .
yes , mr. dussel .
according to him , nothing , i repeat , nothing , is right about me .
someday , i'm going to give you such a smack ... ... that you 'll fly right up to the ceiling .
why is it that every grownup thinks he knows the way to bring up children?
particularly the grownups that haven 't any .
monday , the 9th of november , 1942 .
wonderful news !
the allies have landed in africa !
that measure of ....
churchill spoke on the bbc from london .
man on radlo : which they have so often meted out to others .
ah , this is not the end .
it is not even the beginning of the end .
no , but it is , perhaps , the end of the beginning .
the air raids are getting worse .
the british planes come over , day and night , on their way to germany .
it's too much .
it's just too much .
suppose they hit this house?
what will we do?
we can't go out in the street .
what will we do?
if they hit this house , your worries will be over .
that big explosion , an english plane fell right in this block !
peter .
peter !
it's far away from here .
please don't .
just look at them .
mrs. van daan , this should be music to your ears .
music?
of course .
the more planes they send , the sooner the war will be over .
the sooner we'll be home again .
i don't believe it'll ever be over .
do you know what i'd like right now?
a cup of tea .
oh , yes , please .
you can't have tea , then , for breakfast .
if you have it now , you won't have any tomorrow .
i don't care .
neither do l .
me too , please .
how about you , mr. dussel?
tea now or tomorrow morning?
tomorrow morning .
sure?
sure .
i'll take mine now .
the skylight !
edith , come !
oh , peter !
peter !
peter !
peter !
peter !
praised be thou , lord , ruler of the universe ... ... who's sanctified us with thy commandments ... ... and bidden us kindle the hannukah lights .
praised be thou , o , lord , our god , ruler of the universe ... ... who wrought wondrous deliverances for our fathers in days of old .
praised be thou , o , lord , our god , ruler of the universe ... ... that thou hast given us life and sustenance ... ... and brought us to this happy season . " amen .
amen .
amen .
monday , the 7th of december , 1942 .
the hannukah holiday came early this year .
we kindle this hannukah light ... ... to celebrate the wonderful deeds wrought through the zeal ... ... with which god filled the hearts of the heroic maccabees 2000 years ago .
they fought against indifference ... ... against tyranny and oppression , and they restored our temple to us .
may these lights remind us that we should ever look to god ... ... whence cometh our help . " amen .
amen .
amen .
i lift up mine eyes unto the mountains from whence cometh my help .
my help cometh from the lord , who made heaven and earth .
he will not suffer thy foot to be moved .
he that keepeth thee will not slumber .
he that keepeth lsrael doth neither slumber nor sleep .
the lord is thy keeper .
the lord is thy shade upon thy right hand .
the lord shall keep thee from all evil .
he shall keep thy soul .
the lord shall guard thy going out and thy coming in ... ... from this time forth and forevermore . " amen .
amen .
amen .
may i have the hats , please?
thank you .
very nice , very nice .
that was very moving .
it isn't over yet .
sit down !
where are you going?
there's lots more .
songs and presents .
presents?
not this year , unfortunately .
but always on hannukah , everyone gives presents .
everyone .
that's right .
like our st. nicholas day .
st. nicholas day .
no , not like st. nicholas day .
what kind of jew doesn't know hannukah?
i remember particularly the candles .
first one , as we have tonight .
the second night , two .
the next night , three , and so on , until eight candles are burning .
when there are eight candles , it's truly beautiful .
what i remember best are the presents we used to get , eight days of presents .
each day , they got better and better .
we are all here , alive .
that's present enough .
no , it isn't .
i've got something .
