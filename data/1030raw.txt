nurse espinoza , do you by any chance know what time your 9 . 30 shift starts?
9 : 30?
that's what i would've said .
but i had ted stand out in the parking lot and monitor your arrival times this week .
ted?
9 . 34 , 9 . 39 , 9 . 41 , 9 . 33 and 9 . 50 .
how is that law degree working out for you , ted?
i was going to be a senator .
i haven't perused the latest nursing contract ,
i'm guessing it doesn't say " show up when you damn well please .
here's an idea .
what say you stop showing up altogether and we'll replace you with a giant time clock?
if we ever miss you , we'll just have a bob kelso cuckoo bird pop out every few minutes and say , " i've never satisfied a woman .
come on , ted .
dr cox didn't know he was the father of jordan's baby , but they were getting along better .
i love you .
i love you .
as for us , it was the end of our second year , and each day had begun to feel the same .
after a while , your residency boils down to just a few things .
paperwork .
the three prescriptions every patient gets .
acetaminophen for her headache ,
restoril so she'll sleep , and colace so she'll poop .
paperwork .
mind numbing monotony .
and , of course , paperwork .
as for the patients ...
look , because it's diabetes related , the pain in your foot isn't responding to pain killers .
i'd like to try an anti seizure medication before we consider amputation .
good , because i have an audition for stomp tomorrow .
look , just cut the damn thing off , will ya?
that's why i'm so psyched our college buddy ,
spence , was coming to town .
jill anderson .
yes .
no .
monica meyer .
yeah .
yes .
i don't think it's appropriate for us to be rehashing our college sexual conquests with carla in the other room .
leslie stevens .
yes !
on a pile of coats with hundreds of people around .
what a whore !
who else?
who else did you bang?
carla , college wasn't all sex and coats .
spence here got me through a lot of hard times .
why don't you just mousse the crap out of it?
straight up .
yes .
my life changed that day .
man , that was a long time ago .
now you two are engaged , i'm in town because two frat brothers are getting married .
a double wedding?
no .
good for the boys .
the point is , we've really grown up .
that's good , good sauce .
check it out .
free pitcher .
what i've got you on is d five half normal saline with 20 kcl at 1 00ccs an hour .
the cadillac of all hangover cures .
it feels warm in my tummy .
good morning , angels .
did you have one too many daiquiris last night?
spence , this is dr cox and ...
don't bother .
don't care .
he's the scary man you told me about last night .
hey , congratulations .
for what , jackass?
you just had a baby .
no , she just had a baby .
but you said it was his .
and you said something else .
that he didn't know it yet .
that's exactly right .
holy crap .
run away .
run away .
run away .
ok , he hasn't said a word in over ten minutes .
the hell with it .
i'm going in .
dr cox ...
if the next words aren't " see you . " the third will be ,
my crotch , you've punched me in the crotch .
see you .
how about that guy?
yeah .
that guy?
yeah .
maybe it would be easier if i told you whose butt i haven't had my fingers in .
that's a perk you never hear about .
you guys landed your dream jobs , huh?
dream job .
hey , man , how am i supposed to finish this memo?
i don't know .
do you have any interesting patients?
mr weinberg has dementia but still enjoys his ronking .
what's ronking?
ronk !
lnteresting .
hey , sweetness .
ronk .
when do people yell " stat "?
kinda never .
bambi , rounds .
dammit .
run , johnny , run .
trying to add a little drama .
i felt it .
this is not a good day to be late .
every year , kelso picks a resident to ride mercilessly until they crumble .
the key is to jump on any easy question and impress him early .
right , shall we get started?
y es !
excuse me?
should we get started?
yes .
wow ...
dr reid , do an abg on bed four without waking him .
dr ...
young asian fellow , bed seven needs a central line .
dr murphy and dr eager beaver , step forward .
this is it .
last man standing .
what are the four differential diagnoses of the persistent st elevation on any ekg?
dorian .
lschemia .
murphy .
aneurysm .
dorian .
pericarditis .
murphy .
pass .
ah , doug .
at least you're going to a more chocolaty place .
dr murphy .
ronk !
dr reid !
a moment , please .
no , you didn't .
i did .
every time i turn around , dr kelso's riding me .
i've got next .
what's up?
no one?
self five .
for the big dog .
look , elliot , i've seen this before .
kelso worries he's not scary , so he picks somebody to be his bitch .
who he picks is totally random .
unless you throw a needle in his face .
ok , i didn't tell you the kid was yours and you're upset .
i get it .
but you seem to be making a really big deal out of this .
is there something else that's bothering you?
it's mostly just the kid thing .
i didn't want you to feel pressured to be with me .
i didn't want you to feel manipulated .
i am so , so sorry , but no matter what you say , you don't have a leg to stand on .
i don't know about that , perry .
sounds like she's trying to protect your relationship .
some mothers say the only way to get a guy to marry you
is by using pregnancy as a trap .
what?
stupid mothers who got even meaner when they stopped drinking .
morning .
i make more than you do .
what?
i saw your paycheck .
i make more than you do .
quite a bit more .
you couldn't have seen it .
no way i could access the personnel files .
just impossible .
by the way , 987654320 .
my social security number .
no .
that's your pln number .
no , my pln number is 3674 .
bingo .
do you have any idea what it feels like to have a janitor make more than you?
johnny .
investment banker .
so , no .
why , christopher?
i've saved up 500 bucks .
where would you put that if you were me?
a wallet , a money clip .
you could get schmitty and dan a wedding gift .
dan wants a ferret .
ferrets are nice .
they're mean .
let's go do something special tonight .
my treat .
we gotta kinda lay low tonight .
we're on backup call .
see , now , this is the proper way to lay low .
i mean , honestly , does it get any better?
no , it does not .
why do you keep looking at me like that?
people .
ed , did you turn on the jets in the hot tub?
no .
it's too hot on my eyes !
those sutures look awful , don't you think , ted?
i don't know , sir .
yes?
no?
i'm barely here .
i know what you're doing , sir , the whole keep us scared thing .
i'm ok with it .
dr reid .
even if you hadn't just missed blinding me earlier ,
i still would've picked you to crap on .
you're easily startled , you're constantly overwhelmed .
while you work hard , you still struggle to break into the middle of the pack .
i chose you because i am hoping that you will ask yourself , really ask yourself , if there isn't some other profession you might be better suited for .
in the meantime , be a doll and re suture that wound .
wanna get a beer later?
i can't believe you didn't tell me .
and while we're coming completely clean , perry ,
i'm not the girl they're singing about in my sharona .
her name's sharona .
you're making jokes?
i just want this to be ok .
don't get me wrong .
i wanna be with the kid .
i'm damn sure gonna be with the kid .
but as far as you and i go ... ... i just don't see us working out .
nothing like cold beers in a jacuzzi .
am i right , ed?
some days i sit out here for hours , downing cold one after cold one .
what do you do when you have to pee?
so you boys are doctors , huh?
ok , whoa , frannie .
that was my ass .
you guys have to go to work?
no , it's just a stupid intern .
the only way we have to go in is if there was some catastrophe .
in breaking news , there's been a multiple car pile up on the throughway .
plus , the two guys on call would have to be simultaneously incapacitated .
this is my chance to shine .
what's up , chica?
whoa !
oh , god !
part of being a doctor is learning to deal with the unexpected .
whether it's someone who won't take no for an answer .
i've decided not to accept the being dumped thing .
i'm gonna hang around until you forgive me .
or being shaken to your very core .
sometimes it's just having to work in wet grundies .
hey , betty , wilma .
what the hell?
you're only 40 minutes late .
do i smell beer?
we had a few .
newsflash : you can't drink and then come to work .
you're not airline pilots .
look , dr cox ...
no , you look .
if someone had asked me just this morning , is there any way that i could have any less respect for you two geniuses , i would have said , that's not possible .
lo and behold , you pulled it off .
congratulations .
the only problem is i'm fresh out of blue ribbons , so instead you'll have to settle for a lifetime supply of my foot up your ass .
go home .
you're not fit to work tonight .
great speech .
you guys are in trouble .
wait up , i've got my heels on .
after what happened , i was in no mood to be messed with .
hey , food stamps .
little anonymous donation from a guy who makes a little more scratch than you .
you know what?
at least what i do matters .
ok?
you're cleaning the same spot you were this morning .
the smart money says you'll be cleaning it tomorrow .
why don't i just come by then , and you can tell me how what you do day after day makes even the slightest bit of difference in this world?
too mean .
i don't care if i hurt his feelings , i got absolutely crushed tonight .
turk and i both knew who was responsible for all this .
crockett .
tubbs .
when do we eat?
jordan , could you just give me ten seconds to myself here?
no .
you know , you are being very immature and , oh , my god , is that guy on fire?
dr cox , i'm so glad you're here .
from one hell to another .
dr kelso's been torturing me lately .
i thought i could handle it .
i've come a long way .
i was afraid of you , and now i can talk to you ,
iike how your hair's been looking springy lately , not like the season , like the inside of a mattress .
i don't have any clue what you mean .
dr kelso's starting to get to me , and i don't think i can take it anymore .
sorry , kid , but i'm dealing with my own stuff right now .
thanks a lot ... really .
howdy , mop top .
oh , god .
man , why'd you even show up this weekend?
what are you talking about?
i introduced schmitty and dan .
ok , i didn't really introduce them .
i'm the one who accidentally saw them under the foosball table .
oh , schmitty .
typical spence .
you just blow into town and get us into trouble .
what?
i made you guys go out tonight?
hey , i have a presentation on thursday .
ask me if i'll go out drinking wednesday night .
you wanna go out ...?
sorry .
i can't , i have a presentation .
the truth is , you've been complaining about work since the second i got here , dying for an excuse to blow it off .
so maybe you should stop being all mad at me when , really , you're just pissed because you hate your jobs .
every time i turn around , kelso's there .
ted , he's trying to break my spirit .
do you have any idea what that feels like?
i'm sorry .
of course you do .
dr reid , i'm afraid that nothing you've described constitutes harassment .
swing and a miss , eh , dr reid?
the next time you decide to make a stink over nothing , you should see a lawyer who didn't need five tries to pass the bar exam .
i have stress induced dyslexia and you know that , dr oslek .
why are you doing this?
i'll tell you why , perry .
we've been dancing the same dance for years now .
one gets angry and walks away , the other's too stubborn to go after them .
before you know it , you sleep with some pharmaceutical rep ,
i'm convincing my mom that the thing in my suitcase is a giant electric melon baller .
guess what?
things are different now .
we have a kid together .
i'm not going home until you promise you're coming with me .
you go home .
i'll meet you there later .
bring dinner .
you're a father .
can you believe it?
nope .
i didn't get a lot of sleep thinking about what spence had said .
look , i'm sorry i was such a jerk yesterday .
ok?
come on , look at this floor .
you could practically eat off of it .
would you?
would i what?
would you eat off the floor?
as i bent down to eat that peppered floor turkey , unaware that the cleanser the janitor uses is an extremely potent diuretic , i realised something .
the reason we 're doctors is because we have an innate desire to help people .
that was disgusting .
you have to have that desire , because at the end of your second year , it's impossible to see the light at the end of the tunnel .
so it becomes about perseverance .
and fortitude .
and sacrifice .
sorry you guys can't make the wedding .
give them a big kiss for us .
t ell them the ferret only eats fresh vegetables .
i'm gonna miss you guys .
i'll see ya later .
later , dude .
really , all you can hope for is an occasional thank you .
i'm so glad the medication worked .
i'm supposed to be happy cos somebody did something right?
you're welcome .
nice call on the anti seizure medicine .
i'm starting to think you may not be the worst resident that ever lived .
how cool was that?
shut up .
you shut up .
you're an angry man .
sorry i didn't tell you about the " it's your baby " thing .
we'll probably talk about that later .
i wasn't even mad at jordan .
no?
i was scared .
i was freaking out , cos i'm confident that i'll be a horrible father .
you?
come on .
you're gonna be a very scary ...
i mean , great .
you're gonna be a great father .
last night , you totally kicked our asses cos we deserved it .
remember you told me i wasn't the worst resident that ever lived?
eight seconds ago?
you have no idea how much that meant to me .
i said , i think you may not be the worst resident ever , but i can't be sure of stuff like that .
i haven't done the legwork .
you're always there when we need you .
i think you have this fathering thing down .
why am i not leaving , dr reid?
i don't want to miss you breaking down and weeping in front of everyone .
here it comes .
great big tears .
great big crocodile tears .
if she was your daughter , you'd totally know how to handle it .
my god , you're right .
you're doing fine , barbie .
thank you .
everybody have a good one .
i'm going home to see my son .
excuse me there , bobbo .
right in the nose .
yeah .
that may come up tomorrow .
