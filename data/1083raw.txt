he wants to be a dentist just like his dad .
all right , let's see what's going on in there .
oh , boy .
aah ...
dr. brooks , is this gonna hurt?
i'm afraid just a little .
more than a tickle but way less than paying your taxes .
that's right .
all right , let's see .
dr. brooks !

me?
mm hmm .
son , if you want to be a great dentist never forget the personal touch .

hi .
how are you?
can i ...?
excuse us for a second .
uh , enjoy them .
come on , mom .
mom ...
i love that you're involved in my practice ... but you can't be giving out sugar cookies in a dental office .
your father always believed in the personal touch .
and repeat business .
hey , t , got a surprise .
this guy says he's an old buddy of yours .
i don't know this man .
well , i'm ernesto julio raphael santisto .
oh .
and you've been served .
do you validate?
oh , no , you got to go .
hey , hey , stamp my ticket , man .
sure , i'm gonna stamp your head .
stamp my ticket !
ted?
are you being sued?
oh , hey , if this is about that freeman kid ...
he's lying .
i mean , okay , maybe i shouldn't have been drilling left handed but he dared me ...
would you shut up .
it's about a will .
but i definitely think they have the wrong theodore brooks .
it's about some lady in alaska , a place called tolketna .
alaska? !
they definitely got the wrong ted brooks .
see , they're looking for the white ted brooks .
well , her name is lucy watkins ...
mom !
rupert , get her something to drink !
wait a minute , relax , relax .
sit down .
breathe , breathe .
here .
rinse and spit .
oh , teddy bear ...
how can i ...?
how do i ...?
how do you what? !
ted ...
teddy ...
you're adopted .
we always meant to tell you and then your father died ...
this doesn't change anything .
you will always be my teddy bear ... my teddy bear ...
ted !
hey , ted , come on .
don't trip on this .
all right?
a lot of people are adopted .
famous people .
you know , you got webster and soon yi .
and those kids from different strokes they turned out okay .
i should've known .
please .
there were so many signs .
really?
yeah , i ...
like what?
well ...
like blue cheese !
i love blue cheese , and they hate it .
uncanny .
so how was it living with strangers?
why am i a dentist , rupert?
'cause your daddy's a dentist .
maybe i was meant to do something different ... be someone else .
i'm an eskimo? !
all right , cuz .
i got you everything you need for your trip to alaska .
i'm only going for a couple of days !
yeah , well , i know you just wanted a parka but your credit card wanted more .
oh , i got these shoes for myself .
yeah , fly , right?
what is all of this , rupert?
okay .
for those cold alaskan nights ... you know ... other than getting a little na nooky ...
i got you a personal , wearable ... warm and cold system .
it's the ultimate climate control accessory .
but wait , there's more .
there better not be more .
well ...
you're gonna receive a bill for a massage chair .
out !
i like that co ...
shut up , chester !
i hate you !
when i bought this condo no one told me a little rat like you lived next door !
i'm so sick of your barking !
welcome to anchorage .
we got a real scorcher today ... expecting a high of three degrees .
as reigning champion , what have you learned?
i know that nothing can be left to chance .
in this race ... man and beast must move as one .
and when i cross the finish line nothing refreshes like powerade ... the only drink on my sled .
attention , please .
final boarding call for flight 522 to tolketna ...
oh !
that's me ! ... to tolketna this month .
wait !
hold that plane !
wait !
wait !
sir , please !

wait !
wait !

that's okay , i'll walk !
george murphy , you're clear for takeoff so quit dawdling and move it !
george murphy?
you're the one that sent me the summons?
why , yes .
at your service .
but if you're the executor of the estate then why are you , uh ...?
i'm an attorney , the justice of the peace and the bush pilot .
a classic triple threat .
8 6 7 2 4 1 queen , move it !
or you're going to be the hood ornament on a 737 !
the captain has turned off the seat belt sign .
you're free to move about the cabin .

help me !
there it is .
downtown .
hey , you guys , i know you're starving .
here's your sandwich .
all right , you roughnecks .
give me back those knives .
these are for eating .
nobody's going to order dinner if the silverware's been in the walls .
come on , barb we've all seen your food .
nobody's going to order it anyway .
always a little high .
close the door !
hey , slick .
to your health , son .
enjoy .
he looks just like her .
ah , excuse me .
can i get a cup of decaf latte , please?
honey , you can get anything your little heart desires .
except a decaf latte .
how about a cup of regular?
fresh brewed yesterday .
sure , as long as it's hot .
coffee ...
here you go .
a hot cup of java .
so , how are you enjoying tolketna?
just trying to keep up with the hustle and bustle .
hey , mister we got to talk .
i've been waiting a long time for a dentist to come to town .
yeah , i got a canker sore in the back of my mouth .
and isn't that stench unbearable?
all right , quiet !
now , pipe down !
time to get started !
we got a will to read here !
george !
knock it off !
i just patched the last hole !
all right .
now , we're here to read the last will and testament of lucy watkins .
so , here goes .
oh , " first off , i'd like to thank you all for coming .
though if there was a blizzard , i understand .
now , i don't want any crying .
people should enjoy themselves .
so , barb , why don't you pour a round of wild turkey on me .
pass it around .
here ya go .
what's with sasquatch?
zip your lip .
that's thunder jack .
they call him that
'cause he got hit by thunder .
twice !
you can't get hit by thunder .
now , pay attention .
now , i led a simple life
so don't expect too many goodies to be bequeathed .
first , to peter yellowbear
my neighbor and fellow snow golfer
i leave my lucky putter .
but don't expect it to improve your game .
next ...
to barb
my dear friend and boss
i give my shearling coat ... " which kept me warmer than any man ever did .
you don't have to talk to it in the morning .
and
to my son
ted brooks
i'm sorry you never knew me
but to you i leave the rest of my worldly possessions .
i wish it were more .
oh ...
and to thunder jack
i leave my outhouse and all its contents .
now , in conclusion , i just want to say thanks
to all you misfits
outcasts
and just plain weirdos .
you made living ln this icebox fun .
if i end up in heaven
i'll put in a good word for you .
and if i end up down below well , at least it's warm .
to lucy !
great gal .
to lucy .
it's hard to breathe at this altitude , huh?
eh , you'll get used to it after a week or so .
oh , no , i'm not planning on being here that long .
i'm just going to poke around ... get a feel for this lucy ... maybe inventory her valuables .
valuables?
you obviously didn't know her .
so , is that all you want ... is to pawn off all her stuff?
well , do i owe her more than that?
huh !
she pawned off her kid .
don't talk about lucy like that .
you don't know anything about her .
is that my fault?
never mind .
forget it .
come on , i'll show you around .
oh , uh , no , thanks .
i think i want to go alone .
'kay .
okay .
one ceramic lamp .
with a tacky shade .
one very dirty throw rug .
yeah ... and ...
arctic challenge third place .
where did you come from?
nobody said anything about lucy having a dog .
of course , no one said anything about her having a son , either .
oh , you're hungry , huh?
well , go tell whoever it is that feeds you .
all right .
let's go see if we can find you some chow .
nope .
in here?
where's the dog food?
not in here .
no dog food .
oh ...
get back !
back !
back !
nice doggy .
nice doggy .
aah !

aah !
stop it !
let go !
let go !
aah !
no , not the jacket !
no , doggies !
hey , i come in peace !
stop it !
ha , ha , wait , that tickles .
aah !
oh , no !
okay , wait !
aah , get off !
let me go !
stop that !
g give me the door !
any more surprises?
where's those dogs?
what?
the dogs , where are they?
they're eating the house .
wait !
wait a minute !
oh , you can't go in there !
this one dog is possessed .
he's dangerous .
demon .
wait !
mr. thunder?
look out .
how you doing , demon , huh?
how's my boy?
oh ... looking good , kid .
how much you want for these mutts?
oh , uh ... well , i haven't checked the blue book yet .
i'll give you $200 .
each?
no , for the whole lot .
well , that seems a little low .
i mean , even the puppies ... in the mall cost ...
you think i'm trying to chisel you?
no .
you think i'm that kind of a man?
why don't we just step outside and settle this thing
eskimo style .
hey !
just you ... and me , a rope and a knife .
and the last man breathing gets the dogs .
$200 is great .
no , it's not .
you just stay out of this , missy .
you cheap chiseler .
you and i both know that any of those dogs is worth $500 and demon's probably worth $1, 000 .
really?
i'm not going to let you take advantage of him just because he's some dumb city slicker .
you want to sell those dogs , you look me up .
oh , what is this stuff?
slump .
slump?
mostly the stuff the butcher can't sell .
hooves , lips , organs ... slump .
in miami , we call them hot dogs .
so , why did grizzly adams want these dogs , anyway?
because the arctic challenge is in two weeks .
these dogs are champions .
except for nana , of course .
lucy just liked her company .
arctic challenge .
what is that?
well , next to the iditarod , it's the biggest dog race around .
five days across 400 miles ... of the most beautiful and rugged terrain in the world .
who'd be crazy enough to do that?
your mother .
i'm not being frisky .
i i'm stuck .
that's what all the guys say .
happens to everyone .
up and at 'em .
you're all chapped .
here .
so , let me ask you something .
what?
did lucy ever mention about who my father was?
sorry .
no one even knew you existed .
oh , right .
well , there can't be too many suspects .
how many black guys are there around here?
including you?
let me see ...
two .
arthur?
you must be ted .
i've been waiting so long for this .
would you like to come in?
of course .
thank you .
i was so worried that you wouldn't have the time to see me before you left .
i have felt this terrible pain for so long .
me , too .
so , should i sit on a chair ... or would you prefer me to lie down?
uh , chair's fine .
so , it's my left rear molar .
filling fell out a couple of years ago .
and now it's purple .
and there's this real rotten odor .
maybe it's infected .
and you're telling me this because ...?
aren't you a dentist?
aren't you my father?
if i say yes , do i get a discount?
doesn't even look like me .
i , uh ... categorized all of lucy's possessions .
these are the recommended prices .
this is what i'll settle for .
and you can keep ten percent for yourself .
oh , what about the dogs?
give them to johnny lightning .
you mean thunder jack?
sure , why not?
he wants them .
i haven't got any use for them .
thanks .
this'll only take a second .
yeah , sure .
you're leaving?
i don't know what i was looking for .
but i sure didn't find it .
well , what were you expecting?
maybe a little truth .
find out about myself , learn why she gave me up ...
hey , why don't you stick around for a bit?
the arctic challenge is in two weeks .
there's hundreds of people .
tv crews come around .
it's going to be fun .
look , i like you .
if you're ever in miami , look me up .
my number's on all the buses .
wait !
stop !
i know who your father is .
hold it , hold it .
what now?
his name is
james johnson .
relax , relax ...
you can do this .
good ...
i hate the snow .
well , well ...
lookie here .
come to sell me them dogs?
you?
you're james johnson?
i don't much like people calling me james .
what ...
you're white .
will you look at that !
do you know who i am?
yeah .
you're the fella that's going to sell me those dogs .
no .
i'm your son .
well , so , how much you want for them?
you knew?
you knew the whole time , and you didn't say anything?
i don't see any good coming from dredging up ancient history .
is that what i am?
ancient history?
i tell you what i'm going to do .
i can go up to $300 for the lot .
the dogs?
don't you think of anything else?
you got no business with them .
i mean , they're special animals .
they need to be taken care of .
you're a real piece of work .
you know ...
i don't believe we're related .
there must be some mistake because you are definitely not my father !
well , tell you the truth ...
i don't much give a hoot one way or the other .
all i'm saying is that you don't belong here .
i'm sure you've got a nice , little condominium some place ... with a remote control color tv ... and a nice electric blanket .
so , why don't you pack up your big city butt and go back there .
no .
i'm not going anywhere .
you are a stubborn fool .
no , you're the stubborn fool !
you must have something wrong with that head .
no , you got something wrong with your head !
no , you got something wrong with your head !
no , you got something wrong in your head !
no , you got something wrong with your head .
oh , well , you know what they say .
the apple doesn't fall far from the tree , jack .
or should i call you father?
or how about papa?
or maybe even daddy o .
i don't belong here?
i'll show him .
i'll be a mush master .
a regular sled doggy dogg !
just watch me , man .
dr. brooks speaking .
ted ...
i promised myself i wasn't going to bother you but we thought you'd be home by now .
is everything all right?
everything's fine .
so , how's alaska?
basically , everything's white ... including my father !
ma?
are you still there?
are you sure?
sure , i'm sure .
well , that explains why you were always so crazy about that michael bolton .
this has gone on long enough , teddy .
i am coming up there .
you're terrified of flying ...
rupert !
get off the phone !
i'm not on the phone !
when are you coming home?
you know , your mother's worried sick about you .
rupert , off ! .
teddy , i'll be right there .
no , i don't need your help .
i'll handle this by myself .
i got to go .
slump's done .
never , ever underestimate theodore brooks
d. d. s. !
bad dog !
bad dog !

bad doggy !
bad dog !
bad doggy !
who made it in the tree , dog? !
who made it in the tree? !
that's right !
that's right !
you can't climb !
you don't know what time it is !
get over here !
how you like that?
oh , that's cold .
i hope your pee pee freeze up .
yeah , that's right , go inside !
this ain't over !
this is only round one !
you're going to wish you never met me !
you might ....
you having fun with that doggy?
you know what your problem is?
see , demon's got it in his head that he's the alpha dog .
you've got to show him who's boss !
bite him in the ear !
i am not putting any part of that dog in my mouth .
suit yourself .
any musher will tell you the same .
oh , you're a musher?
are you kidding?
i'm the only man ever to win the arctic flame three years running .
congratulations .
yeah , well , it is kind of a strange award .
it goes to the person who comes in last .
in miami , three time losers go to prison .
forget it ... rest rooms are for customers only !
out of my way , girlie !
james johnson .
were you being coy , or is that some sick alaskan mind game?
i'm sorry .
i swore to lucy i wouldn't tell a soul about thunder jack .
i just didn't want ... to see you leave like that .
bring it home !
whoa , there .
come on , whoa !
good boy .
excuse me .
it's time for round two .
all right , nana , if there's any trouble , you back me up .
oh , jack !
i got something for you .
mr. thunder?
look , maybe we started off on the wrong foot .
listen , i know this can't be easy for you .
it's not for me .
i had to show up on your doorstep after so many years and i got so many questions ...
i can go to four .
excuse me?
i can go to $400 , but that's it .
see , it's mainly demon that i want .
this is not about the dogs !
look , jack !
got in your new shipment of blue cheese .
oh ...
danish , right?
oh , yeah .
nothing crumbles like danish .
i never seen a man who could eat as much cheese as you do .
they ought to call you monterey jack .
nobody can eat as much cheese as i can .
hey .
hey , no , hey .
hey , give me that cheese .
i'll show you eating cheese !
give me that cheese .
come on , give me that cheese ... or somebody's going to get hurt .
all right .
let's get down to business .
you are not equipped to keep those dogs .
they're not city dogs .
they're athletes ... they have to run
they have to get those hearts pounding otherwise , they go loco .
loco?
so ... show me how to run them .
yeah , we could teach each other .
i need to learn to mush , and you need to learn to floss .
come on , jack .
we need a father and son activity .
father and what?
sure ... can't you see the resemblance?
oh , yeah .
you want a piece of me?
huh?
you want some of that?
what?
what's my name?
you want a piece of me?
come get it !
come get it ...
this was not a good idea !
who's the alpha dog now? !
okay , " place your feet on runners keeping your weight centered ...
blah , blah , blah , all right .
okay , just like a jet ski with fur .
stop that .
hey !
hey , knock it off .
stop it .
hey , how are you going to pull if you're this way?
you got to look that ...
come on , buddy .
i thought we could go ... for a picnic up on the mountain .
sorry .
can't .
i'm mushing today .
see you .
you now , it's not something you just learn overnight .
hey , it's in my blood .
first off ... you have to step on the gang line before you cross over .
all right .
okay , this is all wrong .
you have mack ... next to scoop ... that's a definite no no .
mack always runs best when he's next to diesel .
okay .
see , i got your problem now .
i know what your problem is .
can you hold that?
yeah .
hi , sweetie .
all right , that's good .
and yodel and sniff over there are fine where you got them they're your wheel dogs .
they're not exactly the sharpest tools in the shed but they'll push or pull anything you give them .
look ... twins .
all right .
okay .
what do we do with this guy?
girl .
this is duchess .
scoop over there has got ... the biggest crush on her .
the only way to calm him down is to ... put him with duchess !
good girl .
you two make a lovely couple .
okay , and that just leaves my evil half brother ...
demon .
no , he's an incredible animal .
he was lucy's pride .
yeah , with a lousy personality .
nice doggy .
nice doggy , nice ... doggy .
maybe you should try biting him on the ear .
what is it with you people?
i'm cool .
you cool?
sorry , nana but , uh ... big doggies only .
okay , just got to program my gps here ...
okay !
ready , set , move !
well , at least
i don't have to worry about you getting lost .
let's see you try to throw me this time .
no !
no !
oh , stop !
hey , teddy !
want to drag? !
oh !
ooh !
bad dog !
bad dog !
fore !
sorry about that .
you know ...
i never would have thought of it .
thunder jack .
wow .
oh , i'm glad everybody's having a great big laugh .
they are ... the way you drive that sled of yours ... that's pretty funny .
nice day for a drive , huh , nana?
eat your heart out .
nana
i finally understand sledding .
hmm .
what got into her?
no .
oh , no .
no .
my eyes !
my eyes !
oh , got yourself a skunk , huh?
good eating .
you know , you're getting to be an embarrassment to me .
why didn't you just tell them to stop?
don't talk to me like i'm four .
you're not the boss of me .
of course i shouted , " stop .
they wouldn't stop if you shout , " stop .
you have to shout , " break and hook .
break and hook .
got it .
i want to go , i say , " mush .
only in the movies do they say , " mush .
here you say , " hike .
if you want to go to the left you shout , " haw .
and if you want to go to the right you shout , " gee .
why not just say right and left?
why do they got to make things so complicated?
man , you really stink .
what's that?
don't worry , mountain man .
it's just me .
what are you doing here?
i thought it'd be nice to walk the hill .
and it would be nicer if you give me a ride back down .
sure .
this is where i was going to take you for that picnic .
how did you know about it?
i found lucy's diary .
it's quiet and perfect .
the one place i feel peaceful and can think about the big questions .
this is the place all the folks around here come for answers .
oh , nothing but time and places to think around here .
great places , sure , but , uh , no starbucks .
no indoor plumbing .
oh , yeah?
you know what else they don't have in this town?
crime , traffic , buses to put your face on .
i ...
if i could just get that old man to sit down with me for an hour .
just to find out what happened .
it isn't like i want anything from him .
i don't need a father .
i had a father ... and he's nothing like my father was .
my dad was a great person .
everyone looked up to him .
and your mom?
my mom?
she's amazing .
she does everything for me .
for everybody .
and her sugar cookies .
oh !
you haven't lived till you had one of my mom's sugar cookies .
yeah , i miss her .
maybe the answers for me aren't even up here at all .
maybe the answers for me are hopping on the next plane back to civilization .
you know , the thing about lucy ... is she didn't always win the race but she never quit .
maybe you need ... to finish what you started ... mountain man .
oh , that's cool .
that's scary .
you are such a city boy .
so ... how did you sleep?
that's beautiful .
let's go .
run , dogs , run !
oh , what are the words?
duck and cover !
uh ...
cap and gown !
stop !
stop !
blink and hook .
oh , stupid dogs .
i hate dogs .
i hate 'em .
i hate 'em , i hate 'em .
oh , my goodness gracious !

i was out about three days ... and this storm blew in .
and i should've , you know , bunked down but i kept going thinking i could sneak up a couple of spots , you know?
that's when it turned ugly .
the only thing ... that saved me was finding this cave .
and lucy was already here , hunkered down with her dogs .
now , i'd met her a couple of times in town but we weren't what you'd call friends , you know?
but cold weather brings people together in a strange way .
well , you can guess the rest .
when i woke up in the morning ...
lucy and the dogs were already gone .
she finished ninth that year .
i came in 19th .
after the race , i ...
i tried to find her ... but she'd already gone .
that's it?
afraid so .
it's all i know .
well , a bargain's a bargain .
i guess the dogs are yours .
oh , well , i'll take good care of them .
i guess i'd better be getting on home .
here you go .
here , have some soup .
i thought you said this was soup !
well , there's soup in it .
kid , come on .
i want to get airborne before the winds pick up .
final boarding call .
hi , chester .
hi , buddy .
for the mushers and their dogs nothing can match this moment .
we're here at the starting line awaiting the signal to begin the 112th
arctic challenge sled dog races .
and we'll be here bringing you a word's eye view of all the color and excitement .
back to you , pete .
my people , i love you .
will you look at that?
now , demon , look at me .
my hands are shot .
this is going to be my last go round .
and probably yours , too .
so , what do you say we just give them something to remember us by , huh?
ah , that's my boy .
there he goes the michael jordan of dogsledding
olivier trajean .
teddy?
ooh , my lord , it's freezing in here .
you see that dog out front?
that's the lead dog .
those two in back , they're the wheel dogs but it's the lead dog that drives the team .
he's finished dead last three years in a row ...
why am i a dentist?
you always wanted to be a dentist .
except for that one year you wanted to be the six million dollar man .
you were always running in slow motion .
we had to take ten extra minutes just to get anywhere .
oh , teddy .
is this tolketna?
who's this?
oh , that's barb .
she's just a friend .
so this is ...
she's pretty .
she looks just like you .
oh , teddy , i'm so sorry .
i'll get it cleaned up right now .
don't bother , i'll get a broom .
so , is this the father?
who?
this white man with her and the baby .
oh , look how cute you are , teddy .
he lied to me .
hello?
yes , i need your next flight to alaska .
a test of speed and agility today ... at the arctic challenge .
here at the finish line the weatheris fine , but out on the course a massive arctic storm is blowing in tonight .
the lead teams are bunking at the rusty knife checkpoint hoping that morning will bring relief .
hey , girl .
good girl .
how they look?
feet look good .
old demon never changes , huh , jack?
been kind of ornery ever since victoria passed .
what kind of a man eats before he feeds his dogs?
don't worry , they already docked him 20 minutes for that one .
uh , jack , there's a storm brewing out there .
everybody's bunking in .
come on .
i saved you a spot by the heater .
thanks , ernie .
come on , demon !
pick it up .
pick it up .
pick it up , demon .
hey , hold up , there .
the old fool .
hi .
george .
all right , let's go .
i got to find jack .
ted , there's something you need to know .
later .
he lied to me .
come on .
ted?
wait .
what?
jack's missing .
what?
he made the check in at rusty knife .
then the old fool headed straight into a storm .
that's the last anybody saw of him .
and the weather's gotten so bad ... the rescue crews had to turn back .
i know where he is .
you think you know where he is .
he could be anywhere within a hundred square miles .
come on .
you can't do this .
when i was lost he came looking for me .
i'm not going to let him die out there .
ted , you don't even have a lead dog .
sure , i do .
there's my lead dog .
hi , nana .
nana? !
nana's not a lead dog .
sure , she is .
if i can be a musher ... she can be a lead dog .
that a girl , nana .
ted ... please be careful .
ready up !
mush !
mush !
get up there !
ha !
ha !
mush !
and it looks like our winner is going to be , once again ...
hey !
isn't that guy going the wrong way?
hey , check out ted .
go !
yeah , go !
get up there !
olivier !
did you see him?
no more slump , boys !
it's milk bone for everyone !
olivier , you've won the arctic challenge .
what are you going to do next?
i'm going to disneyland , paris .
olivier !
look what you've done .
we must run away .
i am so sorry ... but all i've got is american money .
paging dr. te ...
here , let me help you .
oh , thank you .
you must be ted's mother .
well , you must be barb .
so , what did he tell you about me?
he says you make amazing cookies .
aw , that is just like ted .
he wouldn't say a bad thing about anyone .
where is he?
that's it !
that's it !
come on , guys .
come on , come on .
right , right , left , left , right !
come on , come on !
come on !
okay , okay .
two minute break .
two minute break .
scooper , what have you got now?
sure , you can dig , but you can't pull?
but wait a minute .
just wait .
now , this is my son .
aren't you supposed to send a search party or a posse or something?
look , ma'am ... we're sorry , but there's simply no way to go through the pass .
and it's too windy to send up a chopper .
i'm sorry .
excuse me .
i couldn't help overhearing .
did you say your son is out there?
to the men and women of the arctic challenge the arctic flame is a symbol of hope .
it can't be extinguished until the last musher has found his way out of the wilderness and crossed the finish line .
this year , that flame flickers for one man
lost out on the trail old time sledding legend , thunder jack johnson .
but we've now learned of a startling unofficial rescue effort that's underway .
ted brooks ...
yeah ! get this , a dentist from miami , florida ... is bravely facing the storm with his own team of dogs .
you go , ted .
tonight , somewhere in the darkness ... a story as old as time itself unfolds as man and animal work together , braving the elements in what has become not a race of winners and losers but simply a race for survival .
whoa , whoa , brake it off .
jack?
easy , demon , easy .
jack?
okay .
good job , boys .
okay , good , good boy .
good dog .
all right , good boy .
good job .
oh , jack .
jack .
okay .
what are you doing here?
your leg's broke .
i'm splinting it .
yeah .
well , how'd you get here?
same way you did .
not bad for a greenhorn , huh?
not bad at all .
so , what kind of crazy stunt were you trying to pull out there?
oh , i thought i could win if i rode off into that storm .
but if i'd bunked in like i should've
i wouldn't have run into that tree , and ...
what ...?
it's the latest in personal climate control .
i guess i ought to thank you for coming after me .
because you didn't ... you didn't have to , you know .
it's payback .
now we're even .
no , we're not even .
you know , i've always believed that a man who don't tell it like it is , is a liar .
and i hate liars .
well , i lied to you , son .
i was at that hospital .
the night you were born , well ... why , you were no bigger than a loaf of bread .
i walked into that room , and the doctor just placed you right in my hands , just like that .
and in all my life i'd never seen anything like it .
but me and lucy knew that we we had no business trying to raise you .
you know , we were no good for each other and we ... we race dogs .
but , uh , kids ...
but lucy ... wanted to bring you into this world .
but she knew that it would be better if somebody else raised you .
so , now , you can't blame everything on lucy .
i was nowhere near ready to be a father .
see ... we were independent spirits , lucy and me .
oh , we'd see each other from time to time and , you know ...
but i did love her .
oh ... oh , i loved that woman .
i miss her .
did she love you?
well , she said so once .
and then she poked me right in the face .
yeah , but you turned out okay .
look ...
i bet lucy would be proud of you .
i know i am .
mrs. brooks ... why don't you come inside?
they'll sound off the siren when one of them comes in .
i'm not going to leave him .
i can't .
all right , guys , let's go .
come on , let's go .
okay , demon , let's get that harness on .
oh , that dog's not going anywhere .
well , what's wrong with him?
he's , uh , gnawing at his harness won't eat .
he's just one unhappy dog .
gnawing at his harness , huh?
yeah .
all right , demon , let's take a look at your chompers .
okay , demon .
you leave me no choice .
good , good boy .
come .
i can't believe ... you actually ... bit that dog on the ear .
but that's what everyone says you're supposed to do .
well , sure , but ...
i never met a man dumb enough to do it .
okay .
all right .
good boy .
open wide .
there we go .
let's see what you got there .
here's the problem .
oh , okay , all right .
all right , demon .
trust me , i'm not going to hurt you .
okay?
my , my , my .
well , if you want to bite me now , go ahead .
mush !
there's a medic down at caribou falls .
what do you want to do?
i have never not finished a race .
well , i'm not going to let you start now .
go ahead , demon !
teddy , i'm slipping out .
hang on , jack !
hang on !
oh .
oh , yeah .
demon , get it , baby !
way to go , demon !
barb , i have a confession to make .
are you barb?
i never told ted he was adopted .
i know .
there were so many times when i could have told him .
it would have been ... the right thing to do .
i know that now .
but from the first moment i held him in my arms
i couldn't have loved him more .
but i was afraid .
i was afraid if i told him the truth he wouldn't love us ... not in the same way .
barb , tell me he's going to cross that finish line .
he's going to cross the finish line .
amelia , he's going to cross the finish line .
oh , i know , dear ... it's just a mother's worry .
i keep thinking ...
it's the siren .
he's coming in .
that's it !
let's go !
what's going on?
oh , barb !
oh ... oh , wait !
get me a close up .
let me help you , jack .
not bad for a dentist from miami , huh?
not bad .
not bad at all .
ted !
let me through , please .
ted !
you're here .
you came all the way here ... to alaska .
i got on a plane ... and 14 hours of prayer later , here i am .
come here ... there's someone i want you to meet .
jack ... this ... this here's my mama .
oh , baby .
oh , baby .
well , it , uh ... it certainly is a pleasure to meet you , ma'am .
you and your husband ... certainly did a fine job with this guy .
oh , barb .
he's an amazing guy .
he really is .
i'm so happy for you .
dr. brooks , the honor is yours .
jack , i believe you earned this .
i think we both should blow it out together .
okay , ernie .
dr. brooks is ready to see you now .
i haven't finished ... reading about the crown and the bridge yet .
come on .
oh , well ...
oh , here they are .
avalanche .
little aleutia .
and there's chinook .
and my favorite , demon junior .
good to see you , ernie .
doctor , is this going to hurt?
oh , just a little .
more than a tickle ... and less than paying your taxes .
okay , open wide .
