you've done enough for me .
please leave .
don't worry about me .
we've come this far .
i can't leave you now .
i hope you're not seriously wounded .
we agreed there would be no more fights .
why did government soldiers turn up?
the general sent them .
they don't know you .
the general?
how did the general get involved?
this case is important .
i had to report it .
the general is taking over .
the soldiers didn't have to be that aggressive .
the general ordered it .
he said we need real blood to draw the 'flying daggers 'out .
even if the blood is mine?
jin , the soldiers 'lives and our lives are worth nothing to him .
you don't know how i felt as i killed our own men .
i feel worse .
i am tortured .
you?
i truly regret taking on this mission .
i've followed you all the way .
endured many sleepless nights .
my heart grows heavy when i think about what lies ahead .
is there no other way to do this?
it's the only way to expose the 'flying daggers '.
jin , you should know , there are more soldiers ahead .
what !
the general sent them .
they don't know you either .
you must stop them .
there is nothing i can do .
the order given to these soldiers is 'fight to kill '.
if you don't kill them they will kill you .
take care .
i quit !
where have you been?
i have a question for you .
what question?
are you for real?
what do you mean?
do you feel anything for me?
don't take this so seriously .
i want to know .
i'm a free spirit ,
iike the wind , always moving .
the wind never thinks too much .
i want the wind to stop and think .
the wind cannot stop .
not even for me?
the wind breezes through without a trace .
now you understand why i'm called wind .
fine , go and be the wind .
i don't need you anymore !
i don't care if you're true or not ,
i have to leave .
i want to end this .
are you going alone?
i'd like to be the wind for once .
where will you go?
who knows .
whichever way the wind blows .
aren't you going back to the 'flying daggers?
do you want me to go back?
i've left them , why would i return?
thank you for all you've done for me .
it's you .
go .
you said the wind could not stop .
a playful wind stops at will .
you shouldn't have come back .
i came back , for you .
nia !
mei , you're back .
who will believe the madam of peony pavilion is the leader of the flying daggers !
i behaved badly that day .
please forgive me .
did i look like a real madam?
very much so .
what do you think of mei?
what do you mean?
i mean her personality , of course .
she's passionate .
go on .
she may be blind , but she's very bright .
hardly anyone can match her .
not even l .
do you care for her?
you are asking ...?
a man and a girl traveling all alone , what else could i be talking about?
mei is a rare beauty .
i care for her a lot .
then , i shall act as the matchmaker for you two to marry .
marriage is a big deal .
this is too sudden . she's not a good match for you? on the contrary .
mei is from a respectable family .
i'm just a humble swordsman . our old leader loved his daughter dearly .
now i've become the new leader , it's my duty to find her a good husband .
i haven't been able to find anyone within the 'flying daggers 'who would be a better choice than you .
what do you say?
i accept your offer . our house is much obliged to you .
you've done us a great favour .
please accept my gratitude .
with much pleasure .
what is going on?
where are our soldiers?
they were ambushed .
you were both plotting to catch me by following mei .
you're not blind?
are you the old leader's daughter?
he has a blind daughter . she doesn't know martial arts , so i pretended to be her .
if you had known the truth , would you have followed her here?
it's all been an act .
who are you , really?
my name is mei .
i'm just one of many girls in the house of flying daggers .
that's enough .
take him out .
you wait here .
i want to finish him off myself .
move .
stop .
do you have anything to say?
you're not nia , the new leader .
you're right . of course i'm not nia .
nia wouldn't show herself so easily .
who are you then?
that is not important .
nia sent me to finish this matter .
you've done a good job , leo .
we've never met before , but i know you by reputation .
three years ago , we planted you as a mole in the government .
you've accomplished much in that role .
i failed to protect our old leader from being assassinated .
nia knew that you were away on duty .
there was nothing you could do .
i'm grateful for her understanding .
we need to win this battle against the government troops .
you and mei have successfully set up a trap for the general .
well done .
i'll report to nia and have you rewarded .
it's my duty .
please tell nia the general has led all his best soldiers towards us .
be careful .
don't worry .
nia has a good plan .
there is one thing i don't understand .
what's that?
who sent mei on this mission?
nia did .
has nia ever considered my feelings?
what do you mean?
i haven't seen mei for three years .
now i have to watch her flirt with another man .
it's not the first time
mei's used her beauty to aid our cause .
i've heard about your feelings for her .
do you still love her?
we're facing a battle that will decide the fate of the 'flying daggers '.
the troops are closing in .
this is not the time for love .
all right .
i will let you see mei .
you haven't changed .
i'm still mei .
it's been three years .
finally , we're alone together .
i know .
you saved me during the battle with the soldiers .
thank you .
you don't need to thank me .
i would do anything for you .
i know .
you've risked everything going undercover to win honour and to impress me .
you're the only one who understands me .
i was all alone for three years .
you were in my mind every single moment .
my love for you was all i had to keep me going .
do you love him?
you knew the plan .
it was only an act between you and him .
there is no future for you two .
do you understand?
nia !
you can't force a woman against her will .
do not pull this dagger out .
i'm sending you back to keep spying for us .
you will be more convincing with a dagger in your back .
you must leave immediately .
yes , ma'am .
i have sacrificed three years for you .
how could you love jin after just three days?
mei , i also have a task for you .
jin is of no use to us anymore .
take him out and kill him .
leo plays a crucial role for us .
we can't let jin ruin our plan .
you must kill him to prevent any future trouble .
you know our rules .
yes , ma'am .
i left you in order to save your life , but you still followed me .
please don't blame me .
if your plan succeeded many in the 'flying daggers 'would die .
you wouldn't let me go either .
it would be me on my knees , waiting to die .
you're right .
if i won ,
i wouldn't let you go .
go .
how will you explain this to nia?
that's my business .
why don't you come with me?
deep in your heart , you have a secret .
i guess there is a man you find hard to leave behind .
yes , a man who's saved my life many times .
was it he who helped us in the last battle?
yes .
then he has saved my life too .
do you still love him?
when can we see each other again?
we cannot .
we belong to two opposing sides .
if we meet again , one of us will have to die .
a decisive battle is imminent .
you and i are just pawns on a chessboard .
nobody cares if we live or die .
let's go away together and roam the world , as free as the wind .
we'll wander around alone .
come and go without a trace ,
iike a playful wind .
no , a carefree wind .
just you and me .
come with me , please .
are you going with him?
why?
you're the love of my life .
you don't have to love me , but you can never go with him .
otherwise you'll die .
mei ,
you've forced me to kill you .
i knew you would do this .
you knew and you went anyway .
why?
why did you go?
why did you go?
why?
to be free ...
iike the wind .
mei .
mei !
mei .
turn ...
what?
turn ...
turn around?
look behind you .
you're a member of the 'flying daggers '.
you're right .
you're the one who loves mei?
yes , i love her truly , while you are only playing a game .
if you love her , why kill her?
it's all your fault .
my fault?
i warned you but you wouldn't listen .
if i can't have her , no one will .
she has betrayed me because of you .
you must die !
fine .
you kill mei , you must die too !
mei .
let him go .
if you kill him ,
i'll kill you with this dagger .
mei !
don't pull the dagger out !
if you do your blood will drain and you will die .
you must not do it !
mei ,
i'm closer to him .
he will hit me first .
you cannot save me with your dagger .
mei !
mei !
you shouldn't have come back ...
i came back for you , my love ...
a rare beauty in the north .
she's the finest lady on earth .
a glance from her , the whole city goes down .
a second glance leaves the nation in ruins .
there exists no city or nation that has been more cherished than a beauty like this .
