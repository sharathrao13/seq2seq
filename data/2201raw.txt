please help me !
i can't move !
help me !
i can't move !
oh my god !
sarah , save what you're doing and log out .
i need you on something now .
what is it?
i just heard from one of our sources .
there's a high probability that someone from our fbi watchlist was spotted in l. a. yesterday .
thomas sharek .
who is he?
he's done work with several terrorist cells outside istanbul . coordinating several suicide bombings last summer .
istanbul ...
there was some chatter this morning about a possible attack by a group out of turkey .
here it is .
from ankarah .
what was the target?
east coast .
new york or d. c.
but the time window passed .
passed?
the targetted time was for 8 a. m. it's already past 10 on the east coast .
what if they got the target wrong and it's west coast time?
then it's gonna go down within the hour .
tell curtis , i'll take this to driscoll .
i can take it to her .
why?
i thought you wanted to keep working it up .
you know , you're really transparent , sarah .
stop trying to be driscoll 'pet , she doesn't like it .
have you had voice confirmation from anyone on the train?
no , the signal has just confirmed a bomb .
we're trying to get in contact now .
it's in a remote area but local police are heading to the scene .
alright .
we have discretionary authority out of point magoo .
have them direct one of their patrol aircraft over the area .
put the pilot in contact with our people .
should we monitor emergency services?
no , county will cover that .
a truck loaded with c4 just derailed a train in santa clarita .
free up some of your people .
division's gonne send over data .
that could be realted to what we just found downstairs .
what did you found?
two things .
first , there was intelligence indicating the possibility of an attack at 8 o'clock this morning .
bombing was at 7 .
that's within an hour of the time .
what's the second thing?
a turkish national ont the fbi watchlist by the name of thomas sharek was last seen in the city . he could be related to the bombing .
okay .
open up channels with divison .
start investigating this bombing .
and work up what you have on sharek .
we'll brief in a few minutes .
what about the defence department meeting?
it's in a half hour .
who's secretary heller sending?
jack bauer .
jack ...
you sure?
yeah , he hasn't been back ... well , since you fired him .
is it gonna be uncomfortable?
what?
going back to ctu .
seeing driscoll again .
i don't blampe her for her decision .
how can that be?
she forced you out of ctu .
she didn't want a junky on her staff .
that's not unreasonable .
you weren't a junky .
you were doing youre job .
i was addicted to heroin .
it didn't matter why .
do you miss your old job?
i could have joined other agencies if i still wanted to do field work .
but i didn't .
i wanted something different for my life .
it might not seem like a lot to you .
but for me , to be able to have this kind of connections .
i couldn't do that before .
i'm glad you can now .
we'd better go .
yeah .
secretary heller is gonna be in the lobby in 5 minutes .
secretary heller?
yeah , i called him dad once in a press conference so i decided then to use his title all the time .
audrey .
your father is a very perceptive man .
i would like to tell him about us before he finds out on his own .
look ...
my dad is kind of old fashioned .
even though paul and i are separated , he ... he still considers us married .
i understand that .
and i don't want your father to draw the wrong conclusion and think that i had anything to do with the break up between you and paul .
yeah , but you didn't .
please jack .
let's just give it a little more time .
i'm gonna tell you something and i don't want you to pannick .
i'm falling in love with you .
look , i dont want you to say anything .
and i don't need you to feel the same way .
i just wanted you to know .
i will see you downstairs .
alright .
here is what we have : a known terrorist named thomas sharek managed through the country undetected .
we believe there's a likelyhood sharek helped organized the train attack in santa clarita .
if he did , he's gonna get out of the country as fast as he can .
which means we have a small window of opportunity here .
who's covering airport and costumes?
i am .
i've issued a mandate to lax , long beach and ontario .
as usual , we can't hear you .
also , where's your labtop in case you need to pull data?
i'm sorry i'm speak up and
i don't need my labtop , i have everything memorized .
what i was saying is that i have contacted all the airports and security .
do we have any local contacts with sharek?
we're looking into those now .
alright .
promote everything we receive up to division .
let's find sharek before he leaves the city .
let's go .
excuse me , mrs driscoll .
don't you think it's a mistake to assume that sharek is on his way out of l. a.?
no .
but the timing on the intel doesn't quite match .
it said 8 a. m. and the train bombing happened around 7 .
just focus on finding sharek .
yes?
it's thomas .
did dar get the briefcase?
yes .
he's on his radio now .
good .
you did well thomas .
what about maris?
he's waiting for you .
he has everything you need .
berous , are you eating with us?
i'll be right down , mum .
i'm concerned about him .
concerned?
why?
i think he's still seeing this american girl , debbie .
you said you talked to him .
i did .
i told him he was no longer allowed to have contact with her .
and he agreed , right?
yes , but i think he's still seeing her behind our backs .
i'll speak to him .
no .
i'll take care of it .
berous , we're sitting down to eat .
berous?
i'm on the phone .
get off and come down now .
who was he talking to?
i don't know .
sorry .
who were you on the phone with?
my pal , scott .
you were talking to that american girl .
no , i told you i don't see her anymore .
don't lie to me , berous .
i hear your phone calls at night .
i read your e mails .
you read my e mails?
that's my business !
don't you raise your voice to your father !
while you live under my roof , there's no such thing as your business .
no more communications with that girl .
do you understand me?
don't look at her you're talking to me .
yes , sir . ... horrible tragedy occured a short time ago .
an early morning communer train collided with a pickup truck that was apparently crossing the track .
most of the passengers were severely injured .
30
ntsp have arrived at the scene and are investigating the cause .
at this time , the authorities are not saying whether this was an accident or a targetted attack but as you can there has been a ...
so far , everything is on schedule .
have yo spoken to thomas?
yes , the briefcase is on its way to us now .
when it gets here , you'll take it to the warehouse .
why doesn't omar take it directly?
he doesn't need to know where our people are working .
that's the safest way .
berous , if your father seem sevre , it's because our job here is a difficult one .
if we are to succeed , it's important that we are of a single mind .
i understand .
what we will accomplish today will change the world .
we're fortunate that our family has been chosen to do this .
we cannot fail .
yes , father .
morning , jennifer .
morning .
what are you doing here so early?
i'm not here early .
been here all night?
yeah .
what are you working on?
nothing right now .
i'm just stealing some software from adobe and microsoft .
you're gonna get caught one day .
hey , mel !
don't tell anybody or i'd have to kill you .
what the hell is this?
wow !
melany , come look at his !
looks like someone's trying corrupt the internet .
yeah , but it hasn't start propagating yet .
they're just placing the nodes .
look at this !
this thing could tank every system in the world !
you've gotta tell somebody .
if i call the feds from here , they'll trace the call , they'll know i was stealing code .
then do it from a payphone .
yeah .
no , i'm up to speed on the train bombing .
how many confirmed dead?
i didn't know that .
i will .
thanks , sal .
32 dead .
what's the initial assessment?
an act of terrorism .
when you get to ctu , i want you to find out all the details and call me .
yes , sir .
and listen ,
i don't want anyone except the two of you to know about this meeting with richard .
of course .
i tried to get ahold of you last night .
where were you?
i had dinner with a friend .
anyone i know?
no .
jack .
sir .
i'll call you when i get to ctu .
yeah , i'll get it .
hold on .
o'brian .
chlo , it's edgar stiles .
edgar , you don" t need to use your last name .
you've been here over a month .
what is it?
okay ...
i've got someone on the other line who says he's a friend of yours and needs to talk to you .
who , edgar?
his name is andrew page .
fine .
put him through .
okay .
hello?
andrew , you know i can't take personal calls here .
it's not personal .
i found something on the net i think you should know about .
what?
there's a fake nat table and several large burped routers .
it was loaded this morning .
how would you know that?
i was trying to download some software and i noticed it .
and by download i assume you mean steal .
otherwise you wouldn't even see the nat table .
okay , fine .
but i hacked deeper and i found all kinds of stuff .
what kind of stuff?
i think someone's positioning code for a major internet attack .
the thing is that not all the code remarks are in english .
what language were they in?
i don't know .
looked middle eastern .
like arabic or turkish maybe .
you find something?
yeah , cyril's working on the list of known contacts of sharek .
this is maris landstraf .
he owns a drycleaners in studio city .
we dug into the records and found his business is owned by an holding company based ou t of ankarah , turkey .
alright .
give this to ronnie , tell him to get over there and see what he can find .
excuse me , mrs. driscoll .
what is it , chlo?
i just got a call from an old classmate , andrew page .
he noticed that a number of high profile internet nodes were compromized .
i think this could be related to our present threat .
what makes you say that?
a computer network virus was launched this morning from a server somewhere in turkey .
that's where sharek is from?
should i start working it up?
no .
the bombing and sharek are all we should be dealing with now .
but pass it to the fbl .
excuse me , sir .
can i help you?
yes i have a scheduled meeting with erin driscoll .
jack !
it's okay , sarah .
this is jack bauer .
oh !
m. bauer .
i'm sorry .
no , that's fine .
chlo , how have you been?
not perfect but okay , i guess .
how are kim and chase?
good .
they just got a house in valencia .
kim is taking care of angela .
chase is working for a private security company .
that's interesting .
i mean , i'm interested , i just have to set up a protocol .
yeah ...
jack .
curtis !
is erin ready for our meeting?
almost .
but i should tell you , you're prbably gonna get cut short today .
the train bombing in santa clarita .
among other things .
what other things?
i wouldn't worry with it .
we're out .
okay , we'll have you in voice 3 , data 4 .
alright .
ronnie , this is jack bauer .
jack , ronnie mabel .
nice to meet you .
hey , jack .
ronnie's got your old job , head of field ops .
yeah , i know .
how's it going?
it's busy .
nice meeting you .
look , would you rather reschedule this?
no , it won't be necessary .
erin will be free in a couple minutes .
i'll tell you what .
what don't you use the station?
make any calls .
it won't be long .
okay .
thank you .
i don't know , max .
let me find out .
i'm on with a representant from vandemburg .
he wants to know how long he'll be pushed back today .
don't change anything with vandemburg .
we'll stick to the original schedule .
okay , max , yeah .
we'll see you then .
have you spoken with your brother?
no , i don't think he even knows i'm coming with you today .
that's probably best that he doesn't .
alright , i'll stay in the car .
dad , look ... even if richard does go to this protest .
it's not the end of the world .
it's not a page 1 story .
that's not the point .
it's an embarassment to me an to the president .
what are you gonna say to him?
i have no idea .
the thing that gets to me is that he doesn't know the first thing about the politics of all this .
he's just doing it to rebel against you .
when did i become the enemy?
what did i do?
nothing !
richard's acting like a spoiled child .
he's gonna have to grow up some day .
audrey raines .
the president is calling for secretary heller .
yeah .
it's the president's office .
hello .
please hold for the president .
james .
yes , mr. president .
james , i'm thinkiong about raising the terror alert level .
because of the train bombing out here?
no , not just that .
langley has picked up some chatter .
we also have intel on some watchlisted individuals who've gotten into the country .
well , my insttinct is to wait until the ntsp waves in on the bombing .
in the meantime , we can increase our state of readiness .
alright , i'll take that into consideration .
i'm meeting with the secretary of state and director shay in a few minutes .
i'll see if they feel the same about it .
yes , mr. president .
thank you .
hello , erin .
hello , jack .
i'm sorry secretary heller couldn't be here today .
it's just as well .
as i'm sure you were told , we have a protocol in progress .
so , why don't we just go down the items and get it over with?
that's fine with me .
i'll be direct with you , jack .
i didn't like the budget your boss proposed .
what's the problem?
well , the department of defence is asking for 85 % of all inter agency moneys which is very little for ctu .
if you want a bigger piece of the pie , you're gonna have to justify it .
i have a proposal for you .
you want to use satellite surveillance for all the traffic at the harbor?
yes .
problem?
yes , it's insufficient .
you need to maintain bodies on the ground .
too expensive .
not if you utilize intelligence from the other agencies .
i'm not gonna have secretary heller sign off on a budget taht doesn't make sense .
i'll talk to heller about it myself .
no , you'll talk to me .
we're not doing this twice .
erin , ronnie has arrived at landshaff's drycleaners .
where's the feed?
it'll be on channel one as soon as he sets the hidden camera .
excuse me , jack .
okay , here we go .
stand down until i give you order .
aaron , go round the back .
sean , you go take the side .
hello?
can i help you?
you must be mr. landstraf .
do i know you?
my name is ronnie labell .
i'm with los angeles ctu .
i need to ask you a few questions .
what do you know about a man named thomas sharek?
i don't know this man .
really?
it's in your records that you contacted him in the last few days .
it wasn't me .
i run a legitimate business here .
i never said you business wasn't legitimate , sir .
you can't just walk in here and harrass me .
he's hiding something .
it's beeing handled , jack .
erin , listen to me .
this store is open for business but the blinds are closed .
there's no other employees .
this guys is way too nervous .
trust me .
he's hiding something .
turn back a little momment , please .
says here you open at 6 a. m. have you been here the entire time?
yes .
what's this about?
right there .
did you see that?
yeah .
tell him to look for something on his right .
ronnie .
on his right , see if someone could be hiding .
do you mind i i take a look behind that counter?
yes , i do mind .
look , this is my store and i want you to walk ou now .
sir , i'm not walking out of there until i take a look ...
jerk !
got him !
great job .
remember , dad , we're on a tight schedule today .
richard .
dad .
hello .
hey , it's me .
hey .
aren't you supposed to be in your meeting with driscoll?
yeah .
she had to step away .
listen , ctu's just picked up a prime suspect in the train bombing .
they're bringing him in for questioning now .
my father's still in with richard .
that's all right .
i'll brief him later .
i just wanted to let you know .
all right .
that's good news .
yeah .
yeah , i think so .
all right ... um , i'll talk to you later .
wait .
wait .
what is it?
look , about earlier ...
i don't want you to think that that made me uncomfortable .
it's just that since teri died , i never thought i'd ...
jack , it's all right .
i understand .
no .
no , you don't .
i just want you to know that ...
i'm falling in love with you , too .
wow .
um , you caught me off guard .
yeah .
sorry about that .
look , driscoll's coming back .
i gotta go .
then go .
okay .
i'll talk to you when i get a break .
all right .
what's happening with the suspect?
ronnie's bringing him in .
who is he?
fortunately , for you , jack , it's our problem , not yours .
right .
i'm going , dad .
and there's nothing you can to do stop me .
how many cars do you need to get places?
i didn't come here to argue about the environment , richard .
i didn't ask you to come at all .
i do not want you to attend or to speak at that rally at lockheed this afternoon .
you don't have any leverage over what i do anymore .
you haven't since i stopped taking your money .
can't you ever think of anything besides yourself?
if you do this , it will humiliate the president , and it will be dangerous to national security .
what could be more dangerous than 2, 500 missile delivery systems?
oh , spare me your sixth grade michael moore logic .
the world is a little bit more complicated than that , richard .
we do not live in a utopia .
america has enemies .
enemies who were our friends a year ago .
and in another year , it'll change again , unless people stop supporting your psychotic need to control the world .
psychotic need? !
we serve our country !
we serve the cause of freedom !
what do you do? !
why don't you just go back to your little motorcade and drive somewhere where people actually buy the lies you're selling?
okay , look , look , we don't have to do this , okay?
we do not have to .
fine , dad .
what do you want to do?
do not disrespect me .
i am your father .
nothing .
it was my friend , not me .
what's his name?
andrew .
andrew what?
andrew paige .
who did you tell?
i swear , we didn't tell anyone .
i don't know .
don't lie to me .
i don't know !
he just stumbled on the site and logged out !
don't lie to me !
where is andrew paige now?
i was just doing my work i don't ...
you can use station five .
chloe's opened up a socket for you .
you'll be able to access the records volume to look at those budget numbers .
okay , fine .
i know this guy .
who , sherek?
we were tracking him when i was here .
we knew him as jann bolek .
we linked him to over a dozen complicated bombings in europe in the late '90s .
unfortunately , we weren't able to stop him from today's attack .
but we did catch him .
and , jack , i'm sorry i was abrupt before .
you helped us with the takedown .
thank you .
erin , listen to me .
this doesn't make sense .
i know this guy's file .
he's a major handler .
he wouldn't risk exposing himself here in the united states for a train bombing .
it's not big enough .
we'll take that into consideration when we interrogate him .
give my best to secretary heller .
chloe .
what?
the original data that you pulled up on sherek , was there any indication of a secondary strike?
no .
everything supports that he was here for the train bombing .
but there was a time discrepancy .
what do you mean?
there was some high probability chatter indicating an attack at 8 : 00 a . m .
the train bombing happened at 7 : 00 .
they didn't give a window?
they actually called for a specific time?
yeah , but the intel was off by an hour .
driscoll thought it was close enough .
you can't do that .
what's your log on i. d. for interpol overnights?
i'm not comfortable doing this .
chloe , please .
you're in .
is this the source?
yes .
that's the decipher .
calls for an 8 : 00 strike
... unless target deviates . " that doesn't make sense .
trains don't deviate , they're on a fixed course and schedule .
sometimes when interpol's breaking codes and communiques , it won't use the exact wording .
what are you thinking , jack?
sherek didn't come here for a train bombing .
something's going to happen at 8 : 00 .
that's ten minutes from now .
no , paul , i don't want to wait .
i'm going to call my lawyer as soon as we get back to d. c. and we're going to get this divorce process moving .
well , what's the hurry?
we said we'd take a year apart and see what happened .
yeah , but it's almost been a year .
i don't want to wait any longer .
hang on .
look , i got to take this call .
we'll talk when i back to d. c.
yeah , fine .
all right , bye .
jack .
hey , i need to speak with your father .
he's still in with richard .
he doesn't want to be interrupted .
this is urgent .
i need him to get me clearance so i can interrogate the suspect in the train bombing .
driscoll won't let me anywhere near him .
i believe he's got information about a secondary hit , a larger one .
supposed to take place this morning at 8 : 00 .
well , it's almost 8 : 00 now .
i know , that's why i need to speak with him .
all right , hang on .
i'm going to speak at that rally this afternoon , dad .
and it's not because i hate you .
it's 'cause it's something i believe in .
did it ever occur to you that these people are using you?
don't you realize they're letting you speak for one reason and one reason only , because you are my son !
well , i wish i weren't .
what is it , audrey?
i'm sorry , it's jack .
it's urgent .
excuse me , richard .
what could be more important than intimidating me?
i didn't know you were hiding in the car .
richie , why are you doing this to dad?
can't you just back off?
i'm not doing anything to him .
you know if you go to that protest at lockheed it's going to hurt him .
whatever it takes to stop what he's doing .
jack , if i step on driscoll's toes and it doesn't pay off , all of a sudden , i have ton of political fallout to deal with .
sir , i understand that .
but i wouldn't be asking you this if i didn't believe there was an imminent threat to national security that i could help avert .
share your concerns with driscoll .
let ctu handle it .
sir , there isn't time .
it's the president .
jack , it's the president .
i've got to go .
yes , sir .
damn .
how long you been in los angeles?
who are you working with?
we don't have time for this .
okay , you listen to me .
unless you start giving me some answers right now , you're going to end up in a hole for the next 30 years .
who are you working with? !
why did you bomb that train? !
how far can i push this guy?
we have to find out who he's working with .
should go as far as we have to .
maybe we should bring johnson in .
sorry , sir , this area's off limits .
oh , i'm looking for erin driscoll .
jack !
jack , what are you doing?
call security now .
what is happening at 8 : 00?
son of a bitch , he's jammed the codes .
i am not messing with you .
you are going to tell me ... what is happening at 8 : 00? !
jack , holster your weapon !
jack !
i said holster your weapon !
call medical .
what is your primary objective? !
i'll order security to shoot you if i have to .
get that door open .
what is your primary objective? !
secretary of defense !
heller .
secretary heller?
yes .
secretary heller's the target .
call secret service now .
call now .
get a team on the way .
yeah , i'll hold .
the president wants us back in d. c. tonight .
what meetings can we eject?
not vandenberg .
the media's expecting you there .
maybe we skip paradigm , and handle that with a teleconference next week .
come on , pick up the phone !
tell the president we'll we rearrange our schedule and fly back this afternoon .
yeah .
audrey , it's jack .
are you still at richard's?
yeah .
you need to get your father out of there now !
the bombing this morning was diversiory !
your father is the real target !
you've got to get out of there now !
target? !
audrey !
oh , my god .
audrey !
on your feet !
jack !
no !
jack !
audrey !
jack !
let her go !
where we going? !
