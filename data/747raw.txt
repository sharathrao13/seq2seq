aah !
aah !
mahtim !
mahtim !
mahtim !
good afternoon , gentlemen .
first off , i'd like to thank this board ... for taking the time to hear my proposal .
now , we've all heard of the legend of atlantis ... a continent somewhere in the mid atlantic ... that was home to an advanced civilization ... possessing technology far beyond our own ... that , according to our friend plato here ... was suddenly struck by some cataclysmic event ... that sank it beneath the sea .
now , some of you may ask , why atlantis?
it's just a myth , isn't it?
pure fantasy .
well , that is where you'd be wrong .
1 0, 000 years before the egyptians ... built the pyramids ...
atlantis had electricity , advanced medicine ... even the power of flight .
impossible , you say?
well , no .
no , not for them .
numerous ancient cultures all over the globe agree ... that atlantis possessed a power source of some kind ... more powerful than steam , than than coal .
more powerful than our modern ... internal combustion engines .
gentlemen , i propose that we find atlantis ... find that power source ... and bring it back to the surface .
now , this is a page from an illuminated text ... that describes a book called the shepherd's journal ... said to have been a first hand account ... of atlantis and its exact whereabouts .
now , based on a centuries old translation of a norse text ... historians have believed the journal resides in ireland .
but after comparing the text ... to the runes on this viking shield ...
i found that one of the letters ... had been mistranslated .
so , by changing this letter ... and inserting the correct one ... we find that the shepherd's journal ... the key to atlantis ...
lies not in ireland , gentlemen ... but in iceland .
uhh !
pause for effect .
gentlemen , uh , i'll take your questions now .
uh , would you gentlemen please excuse me for a moment?
cartography and linguistics , milo thatch speaking .
yeah .
uh , just just a second .
pardon me , mr. hickenbottom .
how's that?
is that better?
uh huh .
yeah .
you're welcome .
and don't let it happen again !
all right , bye .
now , as you can see by th by this , um , map map , uh , that that ahem that i've drawn , i plotted the route ... that will take myself and a crew ... to the southern coast of iceland to retrieve the journal .
ah , showtime .
well , this is it .
i am finally getting out of the dungeon .
dear mr. thatch , this is to inform you ...
that your meeting today has been moved up ...
from 4 : 30 p. m. to 3 : 30 p. m.
what?
dear mr. thatch , due to your absence ....
the board has voted to reject your proposal .
have a nice weekend .
mr. harcourt's office .
they can't do this to me !
i swear , that young thatch ... gets crazier every year .
if i ever hear the word " atlantis " again ...
i'll step in front of a bus !
ha ha ha !
i'll push you !
mr. harcourt !
good lord !
there he is !
members of the board uh , wait !
how did you find us?
mr. harcourt , wait !
head for the hills !
where is a guard when you need him?
mr. harcourt , you gotta listen to me , sir !
uh , sir?
wait !
mr. harcourt !
sir , i i have new evidence that please , mr. harcourt !
stop !
sir , if you could you hold
thank you very much .
look at
this museum funds scientific expeditions ... based on facts , not legends and folklore .
besides , we need you here .
we depend on you .
you do?
yes !
what with winter coming ... that boiler's going to need a lot of attention .
boiler?
onward , heinz !
but there there's a journal !
it's in iceland !
i'm sure of it this time !
sir , i really hoped it wouldn't come to this ... but this is uhh a letter of resignation .
if you reject my proposal , i'll whoa !
i'll quit !
i mean it , sir .
if you refuse to fund my proposal
you'll what?
flush your career down the toilet ... just like your grandfather?
you have a lot of potential , milo .
don't throw it all away chasing fairy tales .
but i can prove atlantis exists !
you want to go on an expedition?
here .
take a trolley to the potomac and jump in !
maybe the cold water will clear your head .
heinz !
i'm home .
fluffy?
here , kitty .
milo james thatch?
who who are you?
how did you get in here?
i came down the chimney .
ho , ho , ho .
my name is helga sinclair .
i'm acting on behalf of my employer ... who has a most intriguing proposition for you .
are you interested?
your your your employer?
heh .
who is your employer?
this way , please .
and don't drip on the caravaggio .
step lively .
mr. whitmore does not like to be kept waiting .
you will address him as " mr. whitmore " or " sir .
you will stand unless asked to be seated .
keep your sentences short and to the point .
are we clear?
and relax .
he doesn't bite ... often .
grandpa?
finest explorer i ever met .
preston whitmore .
pleasure to meet you , milo .
join me in a little yoga?
uh , no , no .
thank you .
did you really know my grandfather?
oh , yeah .
met old thaddeus back in georgetown .
class of '66 .
we stayed close friends ... till the end of his days .
even dragged me along ... on some of his danged fool expeditions .
thatch was crazy as a fruit bat , he was .
he spoke of you often .
funny .
he he never mentioned you .
oh , he wouldn't .
he knew how much i liked my privacy .
i keep a low profile .
mr. whitmore , should i be wondering why i'm here?
look on that table .
ah !
it's for you .
it's it's from my grandfather .
he brought that package to me years ago .
he said if anything were to happen to him ...
i should give it to you ... when you were ready whatever that means .
milo : lt
it can't be .
it's the shepherd's journal .
mr. whitmore , this journal is the key ... to finding the lost continent of atlantis !
atlantis !
ha ha ha !
i wasn't born yesterday , son .
no , no , no .
look look at this .
coordinates .
clues .
it's all right here .
yeah , looks like gibberish to me .
that's because it's been written in a dialect ... that no longer exists .
so it's useless .
no , no , just difficult .
i've spent my whole life studying dead languages .
it's not gibberish to me .
ah , it's probably a fake .
mr. whitmore , my grandfather would have known ... if this were a fake .
i would know .
i will stake everything i own , everything that i believe in ... that this is the genuine shepherd's journal .
all right , all right .
so what do you want to do with it?
well , i'll i'll i'll get funding .
i mean , i'll the museum
they'll never believe you .
i'll show them !
i will make them believe .
like you did today?
yes !
well , no .
how did you ...
forget about them , ok?
never mind !
i will find atlantis on my own .
i mean , if i have to rent a rowboat !
congratulations , milo .
this is exactly what i wanted to hear .
but forget the rowboat , son .
we'll travel in style .
it's all been arranged , the whole ball of wax .
why?
for years your granddad bent my ear ... with stories about that old book .
i didn't buy it for a minute .
so finally i got fed up ... and made a bet with the old coot .
i said , " thatch , if you ever actually find ...
that so called journal ...
not only will i finance the expedition ...
but i'll kiss you full on the mouth .
imagine my embarrassment ... when he found the darn thing .
now i know your grandfather's gone , milo ...
god rest his soul , but preston whitmore ... is a man who keeps his word .
you hear that , thatch?
i'm going to the afterlife ... with a clear conscience , by thunder !
your grandpa was a great man .
you probably don't realize how great .
those buffoons at the museum dragged him down ... made a laughingstock of him .
he died a broken man .
if i could bring back just one shred of proof ... that'd be enough for me .
ah , thatch .
what are we standing around for?
we got work to do .
but , mr. whitmore , you know , in order to do ... what you're proposing , you're gonna need a crew .
taken care of !
you'll need engineers and and geologists .
got 'em all .
the best of the best .
gaetan moliere , geology and excavation .
the man has a nose for dirt .
vincenzo santorini , demolitions .
busted him out of a turkish prison .
audrey ramirez .
don't let her age fool you .
she's forgotten more about engines ... than you or i will ever know .
they're the same crew that brought the journal back .
where was it?
iceland .
i knew it !
i knew it !
all we need now is an expert in gibberish .
so it's decision time .
you can build on the foundation your grandfather left you ... or you can go back to your boiler room .
this is for real .
now you're catching on .
all right .
ok .
i i i'll have to quit my job .
it's done .
you resigned this afternoon .
i did?
yep .
don't like to leave loose ends .
um , my apartment .
i have to give notice .
taken care of .
my clothes?
packed .
my books?
in storage .
my cat?
my gosh .
your granddad had a saying .
our lives are remembered ... by the gifts we leave our children .
this journal is his gift to you , milo .
atlantis is waiting .
what do you say?
i'm your man , mr. whitmore .
you will not regret this .
boy , i am so excited , i i i i can't even hold it in .

i didn't even eat carrots .

pretty impressive , eh?
boy , when you settle a bet , y you settle a bet .
well , your granddad always believed ... you couldn't put a price on the pursuit of knowledge .

dirt from around the globe , spanning the centuries !

england must never merge with france !
what's it doin 'in my bed?

i mean , uh , uh , nice meeting you .
uh huh .

so i says to him , " what's wrong with my meatloaf?
and he says to me oh .
hold on a second , margie , i got another call .
sir , we're approaching coordinates .
hello , margie?
yeah , so anyways , he says ...
all right , let's have a look around .
aye , sir .
set course to 2 4 0 .
15 degrees down angle on the bow planes .
come right 2 4 0 .
welcome to the bridge , mr. thatch .
ok , everybody ...
i want you to give mr. thatch ... your undivided attention .
good afternoon .
can everyone hear me ok?
heh , ok , uh , how how 'bout some slides?
the the first slide is a depiction of a creature .
a creature so frightening ... that sailors were said to be driven mad ... by the mere sight of it .
hubba , hubba .
uh , i'm sorry .
that's ... wrong .
geez , i used to take lunch money ... from guys like this .
anyway , this , uh ok .
this is an illustration of the leviathan ... the creature guarding the entrance to atlantis .
with something like that ...
i would have white wine , i think .
it's a mythical sea serpent .
he's described in the book of job .
the the bible says ...
out of his mouth go burning lights ... sparks of fire shoot out .
but more likely it's a carving or a sculpture ... to frighten the superstitious .
so we find this masterpiece .
then what?
when do we dig?
actually , we don't have to dig .
you see , according to the journal ... the path to atlantis will take us down a tunnel ... at the bottom of the ocean , and we'll come up a curve ... into an air pocket right here ... where we'll find the remnants ... of an ancient highway that will lead us to atlantis .
kind of like the grease trap in your sink .
cartographer , linguist , plumber .
hard to believe he's still single .
you said there'd be digging .
go away , mole .
captain , you'd better come look at this , sir .
ok , class dismissed .
give me exterior lights .
look at that .
there are ships here from every era .
commander , i think you should hear this .
predeshtem logtu nug ... nah geb .
commander?
commander?
enter the lair of the leviathan .
commander?
there you will find the path to the gateway .
commander?
yes , mrs. packard .
what is it?
i'm picking up something on the hydrophone ...
i think you should hear .
put it on speakers .
what is it?
a pod of whales?
uh uh .
bigger .
it sounds metallic .
could be an echo off one of the rocks .
do you want to do my job?
be my guest .
is it just me , or is that getting louder?
well , whatever it was , it's gone now .
helmsman !
bring us about .
tighten our search pattern and slow us to
out of the way !
tell cookie to melt the butter ... and break out the bibs .
i want this lobster served up on a silver platter .
load the torpedo bays !
subpod crews , battle stations !
battle stations !
steady , boys .
don't panic .
jiminy christmas !
it's a machine !
wait , wait !
uhh !
launch subpods !
subpods away !
fire !
we're free .
all ahead full .
fire torpedoes !
fire torpedoes !
get me the bridge !
sir , it's engineering on four .
rourke !
we took a big hit down here ... and we're taking on water fast .
i don't want to be around when it hits the boilers .
how much time do we have?
20 minutes , if the bulkhead holds .
you better make that five .
you heard the lady .
let's move !
move !
where?
move where?
packard , sound the alarm !
he took his suitcase?
marge , honey , i don't think he's comin 'back .
packard !
i have to call you back .
no , no , i'll call you .
all hands , abandon ship .
move it , people !
sometime today would be nice !
come on !
everybody grab a seat and buckle in .
lieutenant , get us out of here !
lieutenant !
i'm working on it !
hang on .
where to , mr. thatch?
we're looking for a big crevice of some kind .
there !
up ahead .
all craft , make your mark 20 degrees down angle .
roger !
20 degrees down angle .
right behind you !
sacre bleu !
we're getting killed out here !
look out !
it's only a grease trap .
it's just like a sink .
it's only a grease trap .
it's just like a sink !
seven hours ago , we started this expedition ... with 200 of the finest men and women i've ever known .
we're all that's left .
i won't sugar coat it , gentlemen .
we have a crisis on our hands .
but we've been up this particular creek before ... and we've always come through , paddle or no paddle .
i see no reason to change that policy now .
from here on in , everyone pulls double duty .
everyone drives , everyone works .
looks like all our chances for survival ... rest with you , mr. thatch .
you and that little book .
we're all gonna die .
ok , people .
saddle up .
lieutenant , i want this convoy moving five minutes ago .
moliere , you're on point .
no , vinney , audrey's taking the oiler .
you know the rules .
i want you 50 yards ... behind that truck at all times .
and , packard , put out that cigarette .
are you sure you're checked out on this class of vehicle?
uhh ...
can you drive a truck?
pfft !
heh heh .
of course i can drive a truck .
i mean , sure , you got your steering ... and your gas and your brake ... and , of course , this metal , uh , looking ... thing .
ok , so it was a bumper car at coney island ... but it's the same basic principle !
come on !
sorry abou sorry about that .
come on , civilian !
oof .
ahh .
you didn't just drink that , did you?
mm hmm .
that's not good .
that's nitroglycerin .
don't move .
eh , don't breathe .
don't do anything , except pray maybe .
boom !
aah !
yeah .
good night !
will you look at the size of this !
it's gotta be half a mile high at least .
it it must have taken hundred no , pfft , thousands of years to carve this thing .
hey , look , i made a bridge .
it only took me , like , what?
1 0 seconds , 1 1 , tops .
looks like we have a little roadblock .
vinny , what do you think?
i could unroadblock that if i had about 200 of these .
problem is i only got about ... 1 0 .
plus , you know , five of my own ... and a couple of cherry bombs ... a road flare .
hey , too bad we don't have some nitroglycerin , eh , milo?
looks like we're gonna have to dig .
it will be my pleasure .
aah !
oh !
stupid !
you are stupid !
i don't understand it .
i just tuned this thing up this morning .
um ...
it looks like the rotor's shot !
i'm gonna have to pull a spare ... from one of the trucks .
can i  no toques nada !
i'll be right back .
she lives !
hey , what'd you do?
well , you know , the boiler in this baby ... is a humac model p54/ 81 3 .
now we got the 81 4 back at the museum .
the heating cores on the whole humac line ... have always been a little , you know , temperamental ... so sometimes you gotta ... boom !
persuade 'em a little .
yeah , yeah , thank you very much .
shut up .
two for flinching .
ooh !
this is it .
it's gotta be .
all right , we'll make camp here .
why is it glowing?
pah !
it is a natural phosphorescence .
that thing is going to keep me up all night , i know it .
come and get it !
for the appetizer , caesar salad ... escargot ... and your oriental spring rolls .
yuck .
i wanted the escargot .
knock yourself out .
there you go , milo .
put some meat on them bones .
thanks , cookie .
that looks greasier than usual .
you like it?
well , have some more .
you're so skinny , if you turned sideways ... and stuck out your tongue you'd look like a zipper .
you know , we've been pretty tough on the kid .
what do you say we cut him some slack?
yeah , you're right .
hey , milo !
why don't you come sit with us?
really?
you don't mind?
nah .
park it here .
gee , this is great .
i mean , you know ... it's an honor to be included in your
mole !
ah , forgive me .
i could not resist .
hey , milo , don't you ever close that book?
yeah , you must've read it a dozen times by now .
i know , but this this doesn't make any sense .
see , in this passage here , the shepherd ... seems to be leading up to something .
he calls it the heart of atlantis .
it could be the power source the legends refer to .
but then it just it cuts off .
it's almost like there's a missing page .
kid , relax .
we don't get paid overtime .
i know , i know .
sometimes i get a little carried away .
but , hey , you know , that's what this is all about , right?
i mean , discovery , teamwork , adventure .
unless , maybe ... you're just in it for the money .
money .
money .
money .
money .
i'm gonna say ... money .
well , i guess i set myself up for that one .
what , is something wrong with your neck?
oh , yeah , i must've hurt it when
aah !
ow !
better?
yeah !
hey , how'd you learn how to do that?
an arapaho medicine man .
get outta here .
born and raised with 'em .
my father was an army medic .
he settled down in the kansas territory ... after he met my mother .
no kidding .
nope .
i got a sheepskin from howard u. and a bearskin from old iron cloud .
halfway through medical school , i was drafted .
one day i'm studying gross anatomy in the classroom ... the next i'm sewing up rough riders on san juan hill .
main course .
i couldn't eat another bite .
i'm watching my weight .
ha ha ha , don't you worry .
it'll keep and keep and keep .
thank god i lost my sense of taste years ago .
aren't you going to pitch up your tent?
uh , i did .
i guess i'm still a little rusty at this .
i haven't gone camping since ... well , the last time my grandpa took me .
i never got to meet your grandfather .
what was he like?
where do you start?
he was like a father to me , really .
my parents died when i was a little kid ... and he took me in .
what?
well , i was just thinkin '.
one time , when i was eight , we were hiking along this stream ... and i saw something shining in the water .
it was a genuine arrowhead .
well , you'd think i'd found a lost civilization ... the way grandpa carried on about it .
it wasn't until i was older ... that i realized that the arrowhead ... was just some compressed shale ... mixed with zinc pyrite that had fractured ... into an isosceletic triangulate .
that is so cute !
say , audrey , uh , no no offense ... but how does a teenager become the chief mechanic ... of a multimillion dollar expedition?
well , i took this job when my dad retired .
but the funny thing was ... he always wanted sons , right?
one to run his machine shop and the other ... to be middleweight boxing champion .
but he got my sister and me instead .
so , what what happened to your sister?
she's 24 and 0 , with a shot at the title next month .
anyway , i'm saving up ... so my pap and i can open another shop .
forget your jammies , mrs. packard?
i sleep in the nude .
you're gonna want a pair of these .
she sleepwalks .
well , as far as me goes ...
i just like to blow things up .
come on , vinny ... tell the kid the truth .
my family owned a flower shop .
we would sell roses ... carnations , baby's breath , you name it .
one day , i'm making ... about three dozen corsages for this prom .
you know , the one they put on their wrist .
and everybody , they come .
where is it?
when is it?
does it match my dress?
it's a nightmare .
anyway , i guess there was this leak next door ... of gas or what .
boom !
no more chinese laundry .
blew me right through the front window .
it was like a sign from god .
i found myself that boom .
what's mole's story?
trust me on this one .
you don't wanna know .
audrey , don't tell him .
you shouldn't have ... told me , but you did .
and now i'm telling you ... you don't wanna know .
the redhead's got a gun .
ahh , ooh .
ah !
aah !
holy whoa !
fire .
fire !
fire !
fire !
fire !
i'm gonna kill him .
thatch , go back to bed .
get some water on that fire !
no time !
get us into those caves !
move it !
move it !
move it !
ya ha !
gertie , pull !
milo , jump !
right now !
aah !
aah !
no , no , no , no , no , no , no !
whoa !
whoa !
aah !
aah !
all right , who's not dead?
sound off .
danged lightnin 'bugs ... done bit me on my sit upon .
somebody's gonna have to suck out that poison .
now don't everybody jump up at once .
audrey , give me a damage report .
not as bad as it could have been .
we totaled rigs two and seven ... but the digger looks like it'll still run .
lucky for us we landed in something soft .
pumice ash .
we are standing ... at the base of a dormant volcano .
it just keeps going .
maybe that's our ticket outta here .
maybe not .
the magma has solidified in the bowels of the volcano ... effectively blocking the exit .
i got the same problem with sauerkraut .
hold on .
back up .
are you sayin 'this whole volcano ... can blow at any time?
no , no , no , no .
that would take an explosive force ... of great magnitude .
maybe i should do this later , huh?
if we could blow the top off of that thing , we'd have a straight shot to the surface .
mr. thatch , what do you think?
mr. thatch?
thatch?
hey , wait !
who who are you?
where are you going?
come back !
hey , wait a minute !
who are you?
sweet mother of jefferson davis !
it's beautiful .
milo , i gotta hand it to you .
you really came through .
uh , i take that back .
holy cats !
who are these guys?
they gotta be atlanteans .
what?
that's impossible !
i seen this back in the dakota .
they can smell fear just by looking at ya .
so keep quiet .
i think it's talking to you .
ita , sum amice viator .
dices linguam romae .
parlez vous francais?
oui , monsieur !
they speak my language !
pardon , mademoiselle?
ah , voulez vous ...
ooh , i like her .
hmm !
'bout time someone hit him .
i'm just sorry it wasn't me .
buenos dias .
guten tag !
how do they know all these languages?
their language must be based on a root dialect .
it's just like the tower of babel .
well , maybe english is in there somewhere .
we are explorers from the surface world .
we come in peace .
welcome to the city of atlantis .
come .
you must speak with my father now .
squad " b , " head back to the shaft ... and salvage what you can .
yes , sir !
we'll rendezvous in 24 hours .
let's move it .
you heard him .
i'm so excited !
now , what's really amazing is that ... if you deconstructed latin , you overlaid it ... with a little sumerian ... throw in a dash of thessalonian ... you'd be getting close to their basic grammatical structure .
or at least you'd be in the same ballpark ...
someone's having a good time .
like a kid at christmas .
commander , there were not supposed to be people down here .
this changes everything .
this changes nothing .
take that , mr. harcourt !
your majesty?
on behalf of my crew ... may i say it is an honor to be welcomed to your city .
ahem .
uh , excuse me?
commander?
you presume much ... to think you are welcome here .
oh , sir , we have come a long way looking for
i know what you seek ... and you will not find it here .
your journey has been in vain .
but we are peaceful explorers , men of science .
heh heh heh .
and yet you bring weapons .
our weapons allow us to remove obstacles we may encounter .
some obstacles cannot be removed with a mere show of force .
return to your people .
you must leave atlantis at once .
oh , your majesty , be reasonable .
sir not now , son .
trust me on this .
we better do as he says .
may i respectfully request that we stay one night , sir?
that would give us time to rest , resupply ... and be ready to travel by morning .
hmm .
very well .
one night .
that is all .
well , thank you , your majesty .
mmm .
your heart has softened , kida .
a thousand years ago ... you would have slain them on sight .
a thousand years ago , the streets were lit ... and our people did not have to scavenge for food ... at the edge of a crumbling city !
the people are content .
they do not know any better !
we were once a great people .
now we live in ruins .
the kings of our past would weep ... if they could see how far we have fallen .
kida .
if these outsiders ... can unlock the secrets of our past ... perhaps we can save our future .
what they have to teach us ... we have already learned .
our way of life is dying .
our way of life is preserved .
mmm .
kida , when you take the throne ... you will understand .
so , how'd it go?
well , the king and his daughter don't exactly see eye to eye .
she seems to like us ok , but the king ...
i don't know , i think he's hiding somethin '.
well , if he's hiding something , i want to know what it is .
someone needs to talk to that girl .
i will go !
someone with good people skills .
i will do it !
someone who won't scare her away .
i volunteer !
someone who can speak the language .
for the good of the mission , i will go !
good man , thatch .
thanks for volunteering .
go get 'em , tiger .
ok , milo , don't take no for an answer .
look , i have some questions for you ... and i'm not leaving this city until they're answered !
yeah , that's it .
that's good , that's good .
i have some questions for you ... and you are not leaving this city ... until they are answered .
yeah , well , i ok .
shh !
come with me .
oh , there is so much to ask about your world .
you are a scholar , are you not?
judging from your diminished physique ... and large forehead ... you are suited for nothing else .
what is your country of origin?
when did the flood waters recede?
how did you  wait a minute .
i got a few questions for you , too .
so let's do this , ok?
you ask one , then i'll ask one ... then you , then me , then ...
well , you get it .
very well .
what is your first question?
well , ok , uh , how did you get here?
well , i mean , not you personally ... but your your culture .
i mean , how did all of this end up down here?
it is said that the gods became jealous of atlantis .
they sent a great cataclysm and banished us here .
all i can remember is the sky going dark ... and people shouting and running .
then , a bright light , like a star ... floating above the city .
my father said it called my mother to it .
i never saw her again .
i'm sorry .
if it if it's any consolation ...
i i know how you feel , because i lost my
wait a minute .
wait a minute !
whoa , back up !
wh what what are you telling me ... that you remember because you were there?
no , that that's impossible ... because , i mean , that would make you ... you know , 8, 500 8, 800 years old .
yes .
oh , well , hey , uh , pfft !
lookin 'good .
just , uh , ahem ...
you got another question for me?
yes .
how is it you found your way to this place?
well , i'll tell you , it wasn't easy .
if it weren't for this book , we never would have made it .
ok , second question .
legend has it that your people possessed ... a power source of some kind that enabled them
you mean you can understand this?
yes , i'm a linguist .
that's what i do , that's my job .
now , getting back to my question
this , right here , you can read this?
yes , yes , i can read atlantean , just like you .
you can't , can you?
no one can .
such knowledge has been lost to us ... since the time of the mehbelmok .
oh , the great flood .
show me .
ok , uh ...
follow the narrow passage for another league .
there you will find the fifth marker .
yeah .
yeah , that's it .
how was my accent?
boorish , provincial ... and you speak it through your nose .
yeah , gotta work on that .
here , let me show you something .
what?
it looks like some sort of vehicle .
yes .
but no matter what i try ... it will not respond .
perhaps if  way ahead of you .
ok , let's see what we got here .
ok .
place crystal into slot .
yes , yes , i have done that !
gently place your hand on the inscription pad .
yes !
ok , did you ... turn the crystal one quarter turn back?
yes .
yes !
while your hand was on the inscription pad?
ye no .
ah , well , see , there's your problem right there .
that's an easy thing to miss .
you know , you deserve credit ... for even even gettin 'this far .
ok , uh , give it a try .
yeah , you got that right .
oh , th this is great !
with this thing ...
i could see the whole city in no time at all .
wonder how fast it goes .
so , who's hungry?
by the way , we were never properly introduced .
my name's milo .
my name is kidagakash .
ki ki kidamaschnaga .
uh , hey , you got a nickname?
kida .
ok , kida .
i can remember that .
wow .
what is wrong?
oh , it's nothing .
i just ... got something in my eye .
you know , my grandpa used to tell me stories ... about this place as far back as i can remember .
i just wish he could be standing here with me .
ah !
ah !
ee yah !
tell me more about your companions .
your physician , he is called cookie?
no , that's sweet .
what is?
the doctor .
he's sweet .
oh , he is kindly .
no , no , no , that that's his name .
his name is kindly?
no , sweet .
well , i mean , he's kindly , too .
so all of your doctors are sweet and kindly?
no .
well , i i'm sure some are .
ours is , but that's not a requirement .
you're missing the point .
you are confusing me .
wow .
look at all those tattoos .
shoot .
that ain't nothin '.
look here what i got .
all 38 united states .
watch me make rhode island dance .
go on , baby , dance .
dance .
there you go .
cookies are sweet , but yours is not .
sweet is kindly , but that is not his name .
audrey is sweet , but she is not your doctor .
and the little digging animal called mole ... he is your pet?
close enough .
oh , don't forget to eat the head .
that's where all the nutrients are .
you know , kida ... the most we ever hoped to find ... was some crumbling buildings , maybe some broken pottery .
instead , we find a living , thriving society .
heh heh .
these guys are kinda cute when they're not , you know ... formed into a fiery column of death .
we are not thriving .
true , our people live ... but our culture is dying .
we are like a stone the ocean beats against .
with each passing year ... a little more of us is worn away .
i wish there was something i could do .
i have brought you to this place to ask you for your help .
there is a mural here ... with writing all around the pictures .
yeah , well , you came to the right guy .
ok , let me see .
let's start with this column right here .
uh , well , this , uh , uh , kida?
uh , heh , what are you doin '?
you do swim , do you not?
oh , i swim pretty girl .
pr pretty good !
pretty good .
sw good , swim good .
pretty good .
i swim pretty good .
good .
it is a fair distance to where we are going .
hey , you are talkin 'to the belly flop champ ... at camp runamuck .
oof !
come on , we're we're wasting time .
why don't you lead the way ... because i have no idea where we're going .
are you all right?
well , i didn't drown , so
good .
follow me .
this is amazing !
a complete history of atlantis !
it's just like plato described it .
well , he was off on a few details , but
the light i saw .
the star in the middle of the city .
what does the writing say about that?
i don't know yet .
but we're gonna find out .
come on .
the heart of atlantis !
what?
it's the heart of atlantis !
that's what the shepherd w was talking about .
it wasn't a star , it was it was some kind of crystal ... uh , like these !
don't you get it?
the power source i've been looking for ... the bright light you remember ...
they're the same thing !
that cannot be .
it's what's keeping all these things ... you , all of atlantis alive .
then where is it now?
i don't know , i don't know .
you'd think something this important ... would have been in the journal , but ...
unless ...
the missing page .
you have a nice swim?
hey , guys , what's going on?
what's what's with all the guns?
guys?
i am such an idiot .
this is just another treasure hunt for you .
you're after the crystal .
oh , you mean this?
the heart of atlantis .
yeah .
about that ...
i would've told you sooner ... but it was strictly on a need to know basis ... and , well , now you know .
i had to be sure you were one of us .
welcome to the club , son .
i'm no mercenary .
whoa !
uhh !
mercenary?
i prefer the term " adventure capitalist .
besides , you're the one who got us here .
you led us right to the treasure chest .
you don't know what you're tampering with , rourke .
what's to know?
it's big .
it's shiny .
it's going to make us all rich .
you think it's some kind of a diamond ...
i thought it was some kind of a battery ... but we're both wrong .
it's their life force .
that crystal is the only thing keeping these people alive .
you take that away , and they'll die .
well , that changes things .
helga , what do you think?
knowing that , i'd double the price .
i was thinking triple .
rourke , don't do this .
academics .
you never want to get your hands dirty .
think about it .
if you gave back every stolen artifact ... from a museum ... you'd be left with an empty building .
we're just providing a necessary service ... to the archeological community .
not interested .
i got to admit , i'm disappointed .
you're an idealist , just like your grandfather .
do yourself a favor , milo .
don't be like him .
for once , do the smart thing .
i really hate it when negotiations go sour .
let's try this again .
knock , knock .
room service .
tell them to drop their weapons now !
spread out !
search everywhere !
you're not applying yourself , son .
there's got to be something else .
well , there isn't .
it just says ...
the heart of atlantis lies in the eyes of her king .
well , then maybe old king cole here ... can help us fill in the blanks .
how about it , chief?
where's the crystal chamber?
you will destroy yourselves .
maybe i'm not being clear .
ohh !
rourke , this was not a part of the plan .
plan's changed , doc .
i'd suggest you put a bandage ... on that bleeding heart of yours .
it doesn't suit a mercenary .
well , as usual , diplomacy has failed us .
now i'm going to count to 1 0 ... and you're going to tell me where the crystal is .
1 ...
2 ... 9 ... t
the heart of atlantis ...
lies in the eyes of her king .
this is it .
we're in .
rourke , for the last time ... you've got to listen to me .
you don't have the slightest idea ... what this power is capable of .
true , but i can think of a few countries ... who'd pay anything to find out .
hurry .
get on .
jackpot .
ohh .
the kings of our past .
thatch , tell her to wrap it up .
we got a schedule to meet .
um ...
kida ...
i'm sorry .
come on , let's get this over with .
i don't like this place .
all right , thatch , what's next?
ok , there's a giant crystal ... hovering 150 feet above our heads ... over a bottomless pit of water .
doesn't anything surprise you?
the only thing that surprises me ...
mahtim .
that thing's not on the truck yet .
now move it !
i don't know how to move it .
i don't even know what's holding it up there .
ahh .
talk to me , thatch .
what's happening?
look , all it says here ... is that the crystal is alive somehow .
it i don't know how to explain it .
it's their deity .
it's their power source .
speak english , professor .
they're part of it .
it's a part of them .
i i'm doing the best i can here .
well , do better .
oh , i know .
why don't you translate ... and i'll wave the gun around .
what did she say?
i don't know .
i i didn't catch it .
hold your horses , lover boy .
kida .
kida .
no , don't .
don't touch her .
all right , step back .
sergeant , keep those people back .
you heard him .
step back .
i'm warning you .
so ...
i guess this is how it ends , huh?
fine .
you win .
you're wiping out an entire civilization ... but , hey ... you'll be rich .
congratulations , audrey .
guess you and your dad will be able ... to open up that second garage after all .
and , vinny , you can start a whole chain of flower shops .
i'm sure your family's going to be very proud .
but that's what it's all about , right?
money .
get off your soapbox , thatch .
you've read darwin .
it's called natural selection .
we're just helping it along .
commander , we're ready .
yeah , give me a minute .
i know i'm forgetting something .
i got the cargo , the crystal , the crew ...
oh , yeah .
look at it this way , son .
you were the man who discovered atlantis ... and now you're part of the exhibit .
let's move , people .
that was an order , not a suggestion .
let's go !
we're all going to die .
oh , you can't be serious .
this is wrong , and you know it .
we're this close to our biggest payday ever ... and you pick now of all times to grow a conscience .
we've done a lot of things we're not proud of robbing graves , plundering tombs ... double parking but nobody got hurt .
well , maybe somebody got hurt ... but nobody we knew .
well , if that's the way you want it , fine .
more for me .
p. t. barnum was right .
we can't let him do this !
wait a second .
ok , now you can go .
milo , you better get up here .
how's he doing?
not good , i'm afraid .
internal bleeding .
there's nothing more i can do .
what a nightmare .
and i brought it here .
ah , don't go beating yourself up .
he's been after that crystal since iceland .
the crystal .
sweet , that's it .
these these crystals ... they have some sort of healing energy .
i've i've seen it work .
no .
where is my daughter?
well , she she ...
mmm .
she has been chosen ...
like her mother before her .
what?
in times of danger ... the crystal will choose a host ... one of royal blood ... to protect itself ... and its people .
it will accept no other .
w wait a minute .
choose?
so this thing is alive?
in a way .
the crystal thrives ... on the collective emotions ... of all who came before us .
in return , it provides power ...
longevity , protection .
as it grew ... it developed a consciousness of its own .
in my arrogance ...
i sought to use it as a weapon of war ... but it's power proved too great to control .
it overwhelmed us ... and led to our destruction .
that's why you hid it beneath the city to keep history from repeating itself .
and to prevent kida from suffering the same fate ... as my beloved wife .
what do you mean?
wh
what's going to happen to kida?
if she remains bonded to the crystal ... she could be lost to it forever .
the love of my daughter is all i have left .
my burden would have become hers ... when the time was right ... but now ... it falls to you .
me?
return the crystal .
save atlantis .
save my daughter .
hmm .
so , what's it going to be?
excuse me?
i followed you in , and i'll follow you out .
it's your decision .
oh , my decision?
well , i think we've seen how effective ... my decisions have been .
let's recap .
i lead a band of plundering vandals ... to the greatest archeological find ... in recorded history ... thus enabling the kidnap and/ or murder ... of the royal family ... not to mention personally delivering ... the most powerful force known to man ... into the hands of a mercenary nutcase ... who's probably going to sell it to the kaiser !
have i left anything out?
well , you did set the camp on fire ... and drop us down that big hole .
thank you .
thank you very much .
of course , it's been my experience ... when you hit bottom ... the only place left to go is up .
who told you that?
a fella by the name of thaddeus thatch .
where are you going?
i'm going after rourke .
milo , that's crazy .
i didn't say it was the smart thing ... but it is the right thing .
come on .
we better make sure he doesn't hurt himself .
milo , what do you think you are doing?
just follow my lead .
wow .
i'm impressed .
it's simple .
all you got to do
yeah , yeah , yeah .
shut up .
we get it , ok?
no , no , wait !
gently .
just gently .
hey , milo , you got something sporty?
you know , like a tuna?
how is this done?
all you got to do is use the crystals .
kida showed me .
half turn right , quarter run back .
keep your hand on the pad .
saddle up , partners .
bring jerky and ammo .
i'm so excited .
all right , this is it !
we're going to rescue the princess .
we're going to save atlantis .
or we're going to die trying .
now let's do it !
i love it when i win .
ok , here's the plan .
we're going to come in low and fast ... and take them by surprise .
well , i've got news for you , milo .
rourke is never surprised , and he's got a lot of guns .
great .
well , do you have any suggestions?
yeah .
don't get shot .
there they are !
we've got company !
take off !
take her up !
holy smokes !
you told me he only had guns .
what i said was , he's never surprised .
ok , now things are getting good .
vinny !
heads up !
we can't let them reach the top of that shaft !
aah !
vinny , new plan .
you and me , we're going to be decoys .
audrey , sweet , fly up underneath that thing ... and cut her loose .
we're on it .
lieutenant !
i though you said this thing ... could cut through a femur in 28 seconds !
less talk , more saw .
uhh !
looks like somebody's working overtime .
come on , girl .
time's up .
whoa !
all right , milo , this is it .
any last words?
yeah .
i really wish i had a better idea than this !
we're losing altitude .
lighten the load .
unh !
that's it , unless someone wants to jump .
ladies first .
uhh !
you said we were in this together !
uhh !
you promised me a percentage !
next time , get it in writing .
aah !
nothing personal .
unh !
yaah !
aah !
uhh !
unh !
aah !
uhh !
well , i have to hand it to you .
you're a bigger pain in the neck ... than i would have ever thought possible .
i consider myself an even tempered man .
it takes a lot to get under my skin ... but congratulations you just won the solid gold kewpie doll .
uhh ...
uhh !
uhh !
nothing personal .
tired , mr. thatch?
hyah !
aw , that's a darn shame ... because i'm just getting warmed up .
aah !
aah !
aah !
aah !
thank heaven .
whoa !
uhh !
ahh .
oh , great !
ahh .
the volcano she awakes !
hey , i had nothing to do with it .
this here would be a good place not to be .
no , wait .
we got to get her back ... or the whole city will die .
and if we don't get out of here , we'll die .
it's the only way to reverse this .
just do it !
milo , no !
go !
aah !
whoa !
whoa !
the fissure it is about to eject ... its pyroclastic fury !
milo , mole says the wall's going to blow !
unh !
uhh !
uhh .
milo?
atlantis will honor your names forever .
i only wish there was more we could do for you .
uh , you know , thanks anyway ... but i think we're good .
they'll take you as far as the surface .
we are really going to miss you , milo .
you know , i'm going to reopen the flower shop ... and i'm going to think of you guys every single day
monday through friday , 9 : 00 to 5 : 00 ...
saturday until 2 : 00 .
sunday i'm going to take sunday off probably , and ...
maybe i'll go in for a couple of hours , you know ... but august i'm going to take august .
i ain't so good at speechifyin '... but i wanted you to have this .

wow .
hey , well ... good bye , mole .
now , you sure you want to stay?
there's a hero's welcome ... waiting for the man who discovered atlantis .
ah , i don't think the world needs another hero .
besides , i hear there's an opening down here ... for an expert in gibberish .
you take good care of yourself , milo thatch .
yeah .
you , too , sweet .

sweet , uh , before you go , could you ...

sponges .
what happened to helga?
well , we lost her when a flaming zeppelin come down on her .
missing .
that's right .
and rourke?
nervous breakdown .
you could say he went all to pieces .
in fact , you could say he was transamorgafied ... and then busted into a zillion
ahem .
he's missing , too .
what about milo?
went down with the sub .
ah ha ha !
lord , give me strength .
ohh .
i'm going to miss that boy .
at least he's in a better place now .
