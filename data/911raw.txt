no point trying to win your bread around here anymore .
don't stay here to piss around , won't do you a shit's worth of good .
you'll drink yourself silly and just get frustrated .
take the car keys , it's yours now .
you've always liked it better than the others .
they are no good anyway , if they won't stay here they'll go down south and hang themselves there .
i've had it with this shit but don't do what i do .
this is shit , too .

all of it .

sighing low , the evening comes
lights come on behind the windows
no one else stays behind in the dark
as the lights drive away the shadows of the night
i don't turn the lights on
i don't think i need them now
you're my brightest light
too bright , i'd say
hamburger .

good night .

sedatives .

what do you do , normally?
what do you mean normally?
i've always been here .
what will you do when you get out?
kasurinen .
a visitor for you .
hi , tasi .
hi .
how are you , tasi?
all right .
i've got a job .
go and play somewhere .
where?
in the hallway .
will you marry me?
here?
no , on the outside .
all right , but how?
you take care of the paperwork , i'll come when i can .
you won't .
listen , mikkonen .
i don't think i can help it .
i'm thinking of getting out of here soon .
i see .
how?
don't know yet .
somehow .
getting out is no big deal , many people've made it .
but they've been brought back and ended up doing twice as much time as before .
they've stayed here or gone to sweden .
or headed to the nearest bar and got loaded .
you've got to go further away .
italy or africa , first at least .
i've been thinking about mexico or brazil .
even better .
but that costs money .
you think i haven't planned it all a hundred times?
first you need three grand for a passport and ten more for the seamen to hide you in the cargo and to put you off somewhere around the equator .
but it's dangerous .
if the cargo begins to shift in a storm ...
many've died that way .
you must go underground until you get a passport and find the right ship .
how many years do you have left?
eight , for manslaughter .
but i'm innocent .
are you?
at least in god's eyes .
in a way i did kill him , but the truth is i didn't .
the result was the same : he died , and i was sent here .
all right , let's go then .
i am 37 now and 8 more makes me about 43 .
then i won't last 3 hours outside without killing somebody .
kasurinen !
what?
you can take the floor map with you to bed tonight .
why?
you can pretend it's your wedding night .
kasurinen , taisto .
you cannot see him now , he's in solitary .
why?
for violent behaviour .
he's not violent .
the warden whose jaw he broke disagrees .
it was somebody else .
come back on sunday .
he'll be taken to his cell tonight if he's calmed down .
it's his birthday , would you take these to him?
happy birthday .
i didn't want to begin alone .
age has given me a sweet tooth .
but nobody sends me anything , it's my own fault .
when other boys had their eyes on girls , i sat in juvenile prison for having taken an old lame granny's sledge .
mikkonen .
shoot .
this isn't my birthday , it's sometime in the winter .
the deal's off .
you can't do that !
why not?
i hear the bitter laughter echo in the darkness
tonight i won't accuse you of anything
because for you i would walk through a desert haze
on this autumn night my mind is blue
tonight no stars shine to comfort me
i guess it's useless to hope for anything
best to drown myself in the night
where's the other witness?
there isn't another .
i'll get someone .
in front of these witnesses i ask you irmeli pihlaja do you take taisto kasurinen as your lawful wedded husband in sickness and in health?
i do .
you having both answered yes to my questions
i pronounce you man and wife .
what?
dad , the cops are coming .
four thousand , each .
that's a lot .
there's not much competition .
all right .
how are you going to get the money?
don't you worry about that .
we could help you .
all right .
fix us a car and a gun .
what's our cut?
the passports are part of the deal .
a quarter , regardless of the take .
half .
and you can sleep here before and after the job .
and if we get nothing?
every business has its risks .
when are the passports ready?
in the morning .
all right .
half .
we need a car in the morning .
give me the gun .
let's go .
how much did we get?
enough .
i'll get the passports , you wait here .
why?
i don't trust them .
how did it go?
where's the passports?
the car was fucked .
i know .
you couldn't get it in reverse .
let's split the take now .
i think we'll take it all .
you're a risk to me , if you get caught you may start to sing .
the other one's still outside .
go and get him .
mikkonen ...
take the money and run .
i have to go and i can't take you with me .
you must be a brave boy and wait here for my call .
meanwhile you can pack your little suitcase .
put in it everything you want to take with you .
we're going abroad .
irmeli .
what?
be sure to call me .
we have to get him to hospital .
i know .
stop .
the ship's called ariel .
tonight at ten o'clock , off hernesaari point .
bury my heart at the dump .
what's this button for?
hello .
i understand .
bye .
here's a package for you .
over here .
where's mikkonen?
he won't be coming .
but we are three .
i'd like to see the money .
all right .
let's go .
where's the ariel headed?
mexico .
didn't you know?
somewhere over the rainbow , way up high
there's a land that i heard of once in a lullaby
somewhere , over the rainbow , skies are blue
and the dreams that you dare to dream really do come true
