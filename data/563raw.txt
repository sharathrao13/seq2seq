another day in paradise .
starkweather two delta , your time has come .
you're moving out to the island .
starkweather two delta here .
and , as you know , the biggest dream of my life just came true .
i've only been with you guys for , like , six months , but i won the lottery .
that's right , me , starkweather , ok?
six months .
to go out and breathe fresh air , swim in the ocean ...
i can't believe i won .
you call me mr. popular , i know .
it's me .
it's me .
you guys know i'm not like this , but this is just amazing .
i'm going to the island !
we're gonna have so much fun !
but i need to see you guys out there .
you can do it !
i won !
that was this week's ...
we got a disturbance on elevator 12 , plaza level . ... just moments before his final departure to the island , nature's last remaining pathogen free zone .
lucky guy , huh?
you can be a winner too .
the next lottery is tonight .
the next lottery is tonight .
how long have you been here?
two years .
what about you?
three .
three .
i've been here seven .
if i do the math , that makes me the biggest lottery loser in the room .
i'm such a loser .
sir .
yeah , you .
swipe .
gandu three echo , you've been flagged for public disturbance before .
yes , i had a very small emotional outburst , sir .
safe to say it's over?
yes , very safe .
i'm feeling much better .
well , then , have a pleasant day .
thank you , you too .
you both have a pleasant day too .
feel the stretch .
one more breath in .
but i was in that section .
no , i don't understand !
i tried !
i tried to do the best i ...
listen to me !
remember , be polite , pleasant and peaceful .
a healthy person is a happy person .
lincoln six echo , choices are fruit , oatmeal and any type of bran .
no bacon today?
you got a nutrition flag , means no bacon .
in that case , two eggs , over easy , not too runny , and a side of sausages .
maybe some french toast and a little powdered sugar .
you ain't cute and i got no time for your lip , six echo .
now , what's it gonna be?
move it .
surprise me .
surprise .
yummy .
next .
watch and learn .
next .
jordan two delta .
hi , honey .
hi .
choices are powdered eggs , dried fruit and yogurt .
eggs , please .
ok .
so , where were you the other day?
we missed you .
that's nice of you to say , sweetheart .
get you anything else?
maybe a little bacon .
no , it says i shouldn't .
go ahead .
four , five pieces , please .
thank you .
well , good luck .
gotta run along now .
you're not going .
you gotta stay for dinner .
i softened her up for you .
no doubt .
back on your diet?
you kidding?
i love this stuff .
better eat up .
you'll need all your strength tonight .
is that a challenge?
i promise i'll go easy on you .
please separate .
find your seats now .
yeah . " 'who wants sally? 'said dick .
'i do , 'said jane .
'i cannot find sally .
get up , dick .
get up and help me find sally .
is sally here? " '
dr. merrick will see you now .
what'd you do wrong this time , tough guy?
sir?
you wanted to see me?
yes .
please .
please , sit down .
so , how is lincoln six echo today?
not so good , i guess .
why do you say that?
well , if i'm here , it means i'm not so good .
that's a rather negative association .
my only job is to see that you're happy , things are ok with you .
right .
your file shows that you've been interacting regularly with jordan two delta .
there's no law against friendship .
no .
no , we encourage it , but , obviously , proximity could become a concern .
i know the rules of proximity .
you've been doing quite well in most other areas .
proficient at work , exercising rigorously .
but screening has picked up some trace levels , changes in your metabolism , and you've been having nightmares .
are you saying there's something wrong with me?
why don't you tell me about your dream?
well , it's the same dream every time .
i'm on a boat , headed to the island .
a boat?
what kind of boat?
a nice boat .
draw it for me , would you?
so , you are heading toward the island .
what happens then?
i drown .
really?
why do you think that is?
i don't know .
you tell me .
maybe you're afraid of winning .
why would i be afraid?
you tell me .
what's troubling you , lincoln?
well , it's ...
it's just ...
all right .
tuesday night is tofu night .
and i'm asking myself , who decided that everyone here likes tofu in the first place?
and what is tofu , anyway?
and why can't i have bacon?
i line up every morning , and i'm not allowed any bacon for my breakfast .
and ...
let's talk about all the white .
why is everyone wearing white all the time?
it's impossible to keep clean .
i always get the gray stripe .
i never get any color .
and i hand it in to be cleaned , and someone cleans it , and folds it neatly back in my drawer , but who?
who is that person?
i don't know .
i just ...
i wanna know answers .
and i wish that there was more .
more?
yeah .
more than just waiting to go to the island .
lincoln , it's your nature to question things .
but don't you realize how lucky you are?
that you survived the contamination .
that nature has left you a garden of eden to repopulate .
that , lincoln , is your purpose .
right .
and you?
arert you going to the island too?
no .
my responsibility is to make sure this facility continues to operate .
that's why people like me , my staff and supervisors , we ... ... we can't win the lottery .
let me see that .
you draw well .
renovatio .
what does that mean?
i don't know .
it's always in my dream .
i'd like to run some tests on you , lincoln .
what sort of tests?
nice tests .
come with me .
take a seat .
ok , let's get you comfortable .
swing back .
i thought these were nice tests .
it's a synaptic brain scan .
totally harmless .
don't worry , it's painless .
it hurts .
not really .
yeah , it does !
no , it doesn't .
yeah , it really , really does !
the micro sensors will move along your optic nerve .
they'll be uploading readings to us over the next 24 hours , after which , you'll pass them through your urine .
now , that might hurt .
six echo , you're late .
jones , you ever get bored doing this?
doing what?
this .
i never really thought about it .
i think about it a lot .
about what?
this boring job .
what are we doing here?
we're feeding the nutrient lines .
we eat food , food's gotta have vitamins , right?
it's good for us .
you don't ever wonder about anything?
where do these tubes go?
they start there .
and they go ... right there .
hey .
did you get a look at the new guy?
seven foxtrot .
they found another survivor .
they keep finding them .
he'll probably win the lottery .
straight down , in the hole .
there you go , you try it .
straight down in the hole .
in the hole .
no , no , no .
put it down .
did we all look that stupid when we went through decontamination?
lottery's supposed to be random , right?
right .
what if it's not?
what if it's rigged?
rigged?
i've been working on this .
here .
take a look at that .
it charts the last 20 people that won a spot on the island .
excluding , of course , the women , picked to be breeders .
what is this?
i took the first letter in each name .
i assigned it a point value system , based on the alphabet ,
like the last guy , starkweather , s equals 15 .
q equals 15 , s equals 19 .
do you see what i'm saying?
no .
well , maybe if you would listen to me , i'm trying to tell you .
you string the numbers together .
you divide it by the amount ...
you multiply ...
you divide it by the amount of ...
you divide it ...
you divide it by the amount of people , which is 25 , a thousand plus five , 2500 .
you know what that spells?
j o n e s.
i'm winning the lottery tonight .
did you pack?
no .
gentlemen ,
i'm gonna go mess with foxtrot .
there you go .
straight .
straight down in the hole .
there you go .
straight ...
what?
he had something on his ...
ok .
go .
lima !
are you ok?
what's wrong?
code 15 , we need med techs stat !
lima one alpha .
let's give her some air , ok?
you're gonna be ok , all right?
relax and breathe .
can i get a wheelchair?
it's for lima one alpha .
you ok?
i think it's time .
lima , you're going to the island .
we're going .
oh , you're so lucky .
i hope i see you soon .
everyone , please follow her out .
quickly and carefully .
watch the glass .
good luck , lima .
thank you .
that's fair .
that's real fair .
ladies , ladies , push back , please .
gentlemen .
thank you .
everyone , back to work .
that is so not fair .
oh , man , i hate this jealousy thing .
it's giving me heart palpitations .
tech services .
computer's down again .
i'm down .
computer guy's in sector six .
i have to deal with this mess .
take my tri key .
contamination kit .
hurry back .
absolutely .
hey !
what are you doing?
i'm gonna see this guy .
hey , chief .
we got live wires all over the place here .
hey , i've been looking all over for you .
what?
i've been looking ...
can't hear you .
i've been looking all over for you .
if you go and get yourself contaminated , don't come pointing the finger at me .
how you doing , mac?
what are you doing here?
my chip fried again .
yeah .
how much longer do you think that one's gonna work?
what are you two clowns looking at?
hey , you got any of that stuff on you today?
oh , look , it's break time .
come on .
you're a bad influence on me .
must be why i like you so much .
what's it like where you live?
in sector five?
it's fine .
you know , it's like any other sector , i guess .
i like coming out here , talking .
most supervisors don't like to talk .
yeah .
step into my office .
are these your friends?
yeah , sometimes .
where are their clothes?
what's with dr. merrick?
you mean why does he act like he's got a filing cabinet shoved up his ass?
yeah .
it's called a god complex .
all doctors are like that .
they think they know everything .
what's god?
well , you know when you want something really bad and you close your eyes and you wish for it?
god's the guy that ignores you .
oh .
right .
tech service requested in product extraction .
yeah , i'll be right there .
oh , hey .
let me get that .
where do you get that stuff , anyway?
it's an old stash .
you know , from before .
you mean from before the contamination?
yeah .
come on , you're killing me with questions here .
you got a sweet deal here , you know?
because you're , you know , like , special .
why?
why am i special?
there's another question .
you remember what we talked about?
you don't tell anybody about our conversations?
'cause that can get me in big trouble .
no , i don't .
good .
how's it going?
hey , how are you?
how's your world?
ok , i'll catch you later .
chinese junk locked up again , huh?
yep .
what a surprise .
go hot .
you better fix that thing .
yeah .
you'd think with the money this place rakes in
they could afford decent equipment .
yeah .
ready?
cut the o2 .
seriously , unless you want to see me blow chunks , can you wait till i'm gone?
sever the umbilical .
cutting .
breathe .
come on , yeah .
that's it .
come on , breathe .
breathe .
come on .
come on , come on !
breathe , breathe !
there we go .
now we're working .
he's healthy .
welcome to the world .
so , how's three helo?
good .
he's feisty .
light .
vitals seem fine .
smooth extraction?
yep .
looks like we have a fine product .
tag him and ship him to foundation .
little bug .
maybe next time i won't embarrass you in front of your friends .
it was very sad .
hey .
hello .
hi .
so you just let a little girl beat you , huh?
stim units restricted .
yeah , yeah .
i'll have the veggie stuff .
papassian petal juice , please .
it's good for the skin .
jordan , are you sick?
when i was in dr. merrick's office , i thought i saw your name on a file .
no , i'm fine .
ok .
how are you?
i'm fine .
lincoln , i can tell when you're lying
'cause your mouth smiles but your eyes don't .
i found something .
what?
a bug .
a bug?
a flying bug .
can i see it?
i think it came in the ventilation shaft .
i thought they went extinct with the contamination .
i know .
and how did it get by the pathogen sensors?
it must be too small .
no , it's not too small .
how did it survive out there , anyway?
how does anyone survive?
they keep finding people , but where do they come from?
it's good that they find survivors .
why do you always question the good?
you only think about the bad .
i just have a feeling that something is wrong .
good things do happen .
i want to see that bug .
hey .
gandu learned a new word from the censor .
what?
" dude .
dude "?
what does it mean?
he just called me dude .
hey , dude .
he said " hey , dude "?
d o o d. " dude .
hey , dude .
dude .
dude .
lottery's gonna start .
like you stand a chance .
dude .
light up all etherscreens .
and ... start the lottery .
good evening .
live from ether con , welcome to the lottery spin .

lincoln six echo remains in quarantine after contamination exposure .
jordan two delta was safely transported to her new home on the island .
jones three echo , i need you to concentrate in this lab .
sir , i want to focus more than anything .
i love my job .
it's interesting .
but lincoln six echo has been contaminated , and it really worries me , because he's a good friend of mine .
he's one of my best friends .
my only best friend .
he'll be fine , three echo .
sir , i have one question .
where do all the tubes go?
the human organism .
unique in all the universe in its complexity .
the product of three billion years of evolution .
perfect in every way , except one .
like all machines , it wears out .
for centuries , the idea of replenishing the human body has been at the forefront of science .
we need to turn this bad day into a good day .
how?
a terrific day .
by selling .
by selling .
sell , sell , sell .
you start , i finish .
ladies and gentlemen , welcome to the next generation of science , the agnate .
an organic frame engineered directly into adulthood to match the client's age .
you're looking at stage one this way , sir .
in its development .
within 12 months it will be harvest ready , providing a carrier for your baby , a second pair of lungs , fresh skin .
all genetically indistinguishable from your own .
and , in compliance with the eugenics laws of 2015 , all our agnates are maintained in a persistent vegetative state .
they never achieve consciousness .
they never think or suffer or feel pain , joy , love , hate .
it's a product , ladies and gentlemen , in every way that matters , not human .
this is our public relations director , mr. whitman .
he'll be happy to answer any questions .
once again , thank you .
mr. whitman .
i want to talk about the smartest investment you'll ever make .
and i want to tell you how you're gonna live 60 to 70 years longer .
dr. merrick , albert laurent , blackhawk security .
you come highly recommended by the defense department , mr. laurent .
though i'm unaware of your personal qualifications .
my men are ex delta force .
seals .
i was formerly with the glgn , french special forces .
i understand you had a corporate theft .
yes , that's what i told the defense department .
the reality is a little more complex .
that's why i require your services .
we've had a ... security breach .
you have the defense department at your disposal .
why call me?
because their investment here is sizeable .
one hundred and twenty billion dollars , to be exact .
and i can't afford for them to reconsider .
what you tell them is your business , doctor .
i am in the business of keeping my clients 'confidence .
good .
two of our products have escaped .
impressive , considering they're vegetative .
well , after several years of trial and error , we discovered that without consciousness , without human experience , emotion , without life , the organs failed .
how long have they been missing?
four hours and 36 minutes .
they're on foot?
yes .
wade , 1 . 2 miles an hour , five mile perimeter ,
standby for suspect description .
we're on it .
follow me .
come on , we gotta keep going .
i have to stop .
i can't run anymore .
you gotta try .
where?
anywhere but here .
but there's nothing .
everything's dead , lincoln .
what if we are contaminated?
then we'd be dead .
there's no contamination .
it was a lie .
what is it?
i don't know .
but it's alive .
come on .
it's mean , whatever it is .
let's rest in here .
jordan two delta's sponsor , sarah jordan , is in a coma after a car accident .
she's in need of multiple transplants .
how long does she have?
forty eight hours .
three days maximum .
tell me about six echo .
he was really the first one to question his environment , his whole existence here .
over the last few months , he began demonstrating unstable behavior and i can't account for it .
i'm waiting on the result of his synaptic scan .
what do they know about the outside world?
very little .
we control them with the memory of a shared event .
a global contamination .
it keeps them fearful of going outside .
the island is the one thing that gives them hope , gives them purpose .
everything we expose them to , their programs , their can'toons , books , the games they play , are designed to manage aggression and reinforce simple social skills .
to avoid obvious complications , they aren't imprinted with an awareness of sex .
we find it simpler to eliminate the drive altogether .
in a very real sense ... they're like children .
educated to the level of a 15 year old .
what was that?
i don't know .
but i want one .
look !
route 39 .
route 39 .
come on .
i got it from a friend .
i think that's it .
what's up?
yeah , do you know a guy named mccord?
yeah , we know that tool .
who's asking?
i am .
and you would be who?
lincoln six echo .
jordan two delta .
right .
y'all some of those desert ufo freaks?
u ...
what?
no , i don't think so .
no .
mccord?
well , lucky day , captain kirk .
he's in the can .
he's in a can?
taking a dump .
a dump?
taking it where?
bubba , you're fixing to get on my nerves .
it's the first door on the right .
thank you .
i have to go .
he's taking a dump in a can .
something to drink?
jack?
yes , please .
straight up?
oh , that is bitchir .
so this is sector five?
hey !
you son of a bitch !
you knew !
how the hell did you get out?
why do they lie to us?
tell me !
they're gonna be looking for you .
tell me what's going on !
if anybody sees us together , both of us are gonna be dead .
so , will you just take your hands off me?
let me ...
let me pull my pants up and i'll take you back to my place so we can be alone .
ok?
ed .
mac .
give you ... give you boys a minute?
what?
this isn't what it looks like .
sure .
sure .
get out of here , you stupid ...
will you stop?
you can'tjust bust in on a guy like that .
that's really rude .
she doesn't understand the licking .
you a knucklehead?
you brought another one?
excuse me .
hey .
hey , hey !
hey , hey !
back off , joe , ok?
don't push me !
no , no , no , that's no good .
put it on my tab .
we gotta go .
friends from out of town .
come on , sweetheart .
give me your number .
two delta .
hey , look .
get ...
don't test me .
don't .
well , this is nice .
mac doesn't talk much about his work at the institute .
do y'all work with him?
saving lives and all must be real rewarding .
those are fancy tracksuits .
y'all exercise out in this heat , gonna get yourself nasty heatstroke .
oh , mac , look .
they got matching bracelets .
we should do that , honey .
suzie ...
do you remember the talk we had about all the talk?
yeah .
actually , would you run down to red's and pick us up a sixer of bud?
we've got to talk shop .
ok , baby .
just making friends .
i know .
good .
just ...
bye .
why do they lie , mac?
why do they lie to us?
tell me .
to keep you from knowing what you are .
what we are?
what are we?
man , why do i gotta be the guy tells the kids there's no santa claus?
ok , look .
you're ...
well , you're not like me .
i mean , you're not ... human .
i mean , you're human , but you just , you're not real .
you're not , like , a real person .
like me .
you're clones .
you're copies of people out here in the world .
what?
clones?
what?
why?
what are you talking about?
some hag trophy wife needs new skin for a facelift or one of 'em gets sick and need a new part , they take it from you .
but i have a mother .
i remember her .
yeah , i know .
i grew up on a farm .
i have a little dog and i had a bike .
and a bike .
right .
it was a pink flexi flyer with little tassels on the handlebars and you rode it to your grandmother's .
you ring the little bell and she came out and served you cookies .
yeah .
no .
memory imprints .
i seen them .
a buddy of mine is a programmer at the institute .
he showed me .
there's only 12 stories .
they change around little details , but they're all pretty much the same .
the life you think you had before the " contamination , " it never happened .
come on , don't look at me like that .
at least you had a bike .
wanna trade your rosy memory implants for my shitty childhood , be my guest .
how long?
how long have we been alive?
you're echo generation , so you're three .
delta means you're four .
three?
the whole reason you exist is 'cause everyone wants to live forever .
it's the new american dream .
there's people out there that are rich enough to pay anything for it .
don't people care that they kill us?
that they take parts from us?
they don't know .
they think you're vegetables simmering in a jelly sack .
why do you think merrick has you stuck in an old military bunker below ground?
he doesn't want anybody knowing the truth , especially not sponsors .
sponsors?
the people that had you made .
they , like , own you .
but why doesn't merrick want our owners to know that we're alive?
just because people wanna eat the burger doesn't mean they wanna meet the cow .
besides , do you know how many laws merrick's breaking to have you two hatched?
your sponsors can't have any part of that .
they're like high society , rich and famous .
if they knew , merrick would be out of business .
we have to find our sponsors and tell them the truth .
what?
yeah .
no , that's the worst idea i ever heard .
you know how dead i'd be?
not to mention fired?
we will .
we will .
that's our only chance .
stop , stop !
fold , stop .
brakes .
no .
come on .
you're the replacement engines on their bentley .
they're not gonna care .
what?
they're gonna care?
you know what i would do?
i would just get as far away from here as i could .
go to the beach .
we're not asking for your permission , mac .
we're asking for your help .
oh , god .
infrared's having a hard time picking up a heat signature .

your sponsors names are tom lincoln and sarah jordan .
her sponsor lives in new york .
the number in your name is a regional code .

after that , use the cash .
all right , look .

right .
i got something .
it's hot .

one thing i can tell you about people , is that they'll do anything to survive .

he was my friend !
anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law .
what's a court of law?
they'll run dna .
if the agnates are booked , it'll implicate your clients in a murder investigation .
this is a nightmare .
you cannot allow this to happen .
do you understand me?
you use any force that is necessary .
i'm ordering you to contain the situation .
1 adam 82 , we've apprehended the suspects .

jesus must love you !
that was the craziest mess i ever seen !
come on , girl .
i know jesus loves you .
can you keep a secret , doc?
why , yes , of course .
there is something going on around here .
something you may not even know about .
what is it?
well , i'm not sure that the contamination is real .
why do you think that?
ok .
lincoln told me that he found a flying bug in sector six .
wow .
right .
and i think that might be why he thought he could leave .
have you told anyone else about this?
no , no .
but i'm gonna do some digging .
i'm gonna get to the bottom of this .
and when i do , i'll share my information with you .
thank you .
i want to be helpful .
i like it here .
good .
but i really want to look into the lottery too .
something's wrong there .
yeah .
you know , you were one of the first of the echo generation .
you're very smart .
yeah .
i remember when i first came here .
a survivor , just like you .
one of the first , in fact .
it's natural , even healthy , to question the world we're presented .
you might say it's only ... only human .
oh , that burns !
get me a list of all the echos in active population .
i saw his address .
tom lincoln .
we'll go there when the rain stops .
it'll be ok when we find him .
ok .
that little boy looked like me .
his mom's gonna die , isn't she?
i don't know .
you're lying .
it's cold .
go in .
i can't .
i'll go in .
jordan .
jordan !
hello?
hello?
lincoln !
oh , my god .
my name is lincoln six echo .
i'm your insurance policy .
and what are you doing in my house?
sir , sir .
you need to see this .
it's a ...
it's ...
it's beautiful .
this is a synaptic scan we took of six echo three years ago , before we integrated him into the agnate population .
ok?
this is his scan from a few days ago .
you can see how much the memory's grown .
like he's experienced 30 years , not three , which is impossible .
or maybe this is scarring from a cortical infection that we didn't ...
an infection can't teach you latin , or how to fly .
they are memories .
but they're not his .
they belong to his sponsor .
i've seen you before .
i've seen you in maxim , esquire ...
maxim?
oh , they're mers magazines .
pictures of women with little , tight , short ... ... stories too .
anyway , you're very popular .
there we are .
what is that?
that looks like some kind of thermal ...
boy , your skin is so soft .
did you know?
i put some clothes out for you upstairs .
thank you .
no , thank you .
i keep expecting to wake up .
i thought i was taller .
i'm sorry to disappoint you .
come here .
she is unbelievable .
how is it you've been around three years and end up with the kind of woman
i haven't been able to find my whole life?
give me that .
she found me .
she's my best friend .
why do we sound different?
i'm from scotland .
i'm from scotland .
hey , look .
you're creeping me out enough without that .
without that .
no , really , cut it out .
that's enough .
yeah , that is enough .
i'm sorry .
like a freak show .
yeah , it's weird .
so , you build boats?
i design them .
i draw them , yeah .
here .
i started off with cars , motorcycles .
experimental designs .
anything that blew my hair back .
kind of a speed freak , you know?
petrol head .
motorcycles , wow .
i feel like i've seen these before .
it's something i've always done .
i never dreamt it would make me rich .
what's renovatio?
renovatio " in latin means rebirth .
subtle , eh?
look .
i have cirrhotic hepatitis .
a parting gift from god for all my philandering .
what?
lots and lots of sex .
sex?
sex with ...
you've ...
you're a virgin?
you're kicking around with her and you're a virgin?
ok , i'm not gonna spoil the surprise , but , boy , are you in for a treat .
look , my doctor said that my liver will start failing within the next two years .
i'm not good at all this shite , you know?
confessions and regret .
look .
there are people who are following us .
they're trying to kill us .
the reason we came is we need your help .
help you do what?
to show people what the institute does .
but who'd believe it?
i'm looking at you and i don't .
who is that guy?
i know him .
is he the community announcer?
he's the president of america .
he has a clone .
he's an absolute idiot .
yeah , i never liked him , either .
do a lot of people see this?
the news?
a lot .
then if we can get on there together , people will see us and know the truth .
so the idea is that we both just waltz down to nbc and see if they can slot us in after the weather .
this might not mean anything to you , but there are thousands of us .
everyone we've ever known is gonna die in that place .
help us .
all right .
let me just get my shoes , ok?
tom , hurry up !
merrick institute .
merrick biotech .
how may i help you?
this is tom lincoln .
hi , mr. lincoln .
i was wondering if you could get someone who can explain why my insurance policy is sitting downstairs on my fucking sofa .
can you hold , please?

i'm sorry to keep you both waiting .
i was getting myself organized .
ok , shall we go?
are you ready?
something's wrong .

do you think it's strange that my insurance policy just tried to kill me?
i found this whole operation strange .
where's the woman?
she said she was going out of state ... ... to look for her sponsor .
you've been witness to certain trade secrets .
you mean that they manufacture human beings who walk , talk and feel?
that kind of secret?
have you talked with anyone else about this?
who would believe it?
can i count on that?
the only thing you can count on is that people will do anything to survive .
i just want to live .
i don't care how .
thank you .
thank you very much .
job well done .
jordan?
jordan?
stop .
hey , jordan , it's me .
it's me .
it's you .
wow , that tongue thing is amazing .
i know .
open your mouth again .
how come we never did this before?
shut up .
the island is real .
it's us .
how many are affected?
about half .
the foxtrots , gammas and helos .
we predicated our entire system on predictability .
human curiosity .
so ... we're now facing four generations with the potential for defiant behavior .
what are you suggesting?
a recall .
wait , you mean dispose of over 200 million dollars 'won'th of product?
yes .
great .
cisco ip communicator .
connecting to merrick biotech .
this is charlie whitman , the public relations director at merrick biotech .
my deepest apologies for yesterday's unfortunate inconvenience you had .
your defect in your policy wasrt , by no means , an isolated incident , and it is totally correctable , i assure you .
we are calling other valued clients right now to inform them of a recall , so , please , call us when you get in ...
unfortunate inconvenience?
that's a bit of an understatement .
mr. lincoln , you're home .
arert you traumatized , sir?
i mean , i had a home invasion once where they put the gun to my head .
i never forgot that .
i shook for two days .
what kind of recall are you talking about?
oh , it's a small defect that we found in four of our product lines .
what are you gonna do with the defective products?
starting over .
starting over?
absolutely nothing to worry about .
we guarantee our product 100 percent .
the unfortunate inconvenience for you is we're gonna have to re scan you so that we can re grow your policy .
does today work for you at all?
pick you up by helicopter at 3 : 00?
i'll call you back .
dr. merrick , how do we remove the defective products from the population without disrupting the others?
we already have the mechanism in place .
dahlgren two foxtrot .
cooper five gamma .
mass winnings .
he kept a journal and a lot of maps .
after i figure out how to get that thing in the water , then we can get on it and ... ... we'll keep heading south .
we could live like real people .
tulie two foxtrot .
ginsberg two helo .
we'll disappear .
yeah .
but after .
all those people we left behind .
jones three echo .
when we were escaping ,
i saw this room .
if i could get in and shut it down , they'd see the truth .
gentlemen , there is , however , another matter that requires board approval .
the disposal of 200 million dollars of infected product .
all in favor?
aye .
aye .
aye .
you've been chosen .
you're special .
very special .
thank you .
thank you .
thanks .
here you go .
and what do you say to the nice lady?
thank you !
in bound , jordan product .
escort her to surgery prep seven .
i better say hello .
mr. lincoln , thank you for coming .
it's great seeing you again , and we are so , so sorry about this entire episode .
i want to tell you that we are going to be birthing a brand new agnate for you free of charge .
wort cost you a penny .
after you .
would you like an apple?
an afternoon snack ...?
no .
how long will this take?
it's gonna take about an hour .
i read that you're from scotland .
i prefer ireland .
but what part in scotland ...?
i realize that this small talk is just part of yourjob ,
but let's cut the shite , ok?
point taken .
my apologies .
i'm just a bit of a jabberjaw .
chatty cathy .
turn right .
this way .
i'll take her .
this is gonna be the exact same routine as last time .
mind the hose .
technician will be here .
look at you , so young and successful .
i always wanted to get into yachting .
i hear they're taking your kidneys , your lungs , your heart .
they are gonna hack you up .
too bad .
no one is touching me .
give me your tri key .
you shot me .
shut up !
give me your walkie !
get down .
get down , now !
you all right?
yes .
come on .
i've got this figured out .
i kind of ...
i messed it up in one area right down in there , but the hole doesn't matter .
something's happening .
something's happening .
hello , sir .
hello .
thank you for your patience .
i'm sure you're excited to get to the island .
if you grab your belongings and line up in a single file line and follow me , we'll be on our way .
take this .
go .
you have to keep going .
go .
go .
ok .
go shut it down .
i love that picasso .
do you like picasso , mr. laurent?
you delivered on your promise .
well done .
i'm very pleased .
thank you .
what about the client?
sarah jordan?
she's doubtful .
even if the transplant's a success , her brain damage may be too severe for any real recovery .
you took too long bringing her back .
the girl , you're going to harvest her , kill her anyway , even though it won't make any difference?
that's the privilege our clients pay for , mr. laurent .
now , do excuse me , i have business to attend to .
you know my father was part of the burkinab rebellion?
and when he was killed , me and my brothers were branded , so others would know we were less than human .
i've seen and done things i'm not proud of , but at some point you realize war ... ... is a business .
so when did killing become a business for you?
oh , it's so much more than that .
i have discovered the holy grail of science , mr. laurent .
i give life .
the agnates , they're simply tools , instruments .
they have no souls .
the possibilities are endless here .
in two years 'time , i will be able to cure childrers leukemia .
how many people on earth can say that , mr. laurent?
i guess just you and god .
that's the answer you're looking for , isn't it?
mr. whitman has your check downstairs .
looks like single gunshot .
oh , no .
wrong wrist .
dr. merrick , the body thatjust came in ... ... is the client .
issue a security alert !
lincoln six echo !
down , down , down !
move , move !
disturbance in the hologram room .
i'm on it .
dr. merrick , i sent censors to check a possible attempted breach in hologram control .
one after another , step into the room .
if i'm going to the island , why did i leave my bag?
step right in , thank you .
are you sure you know what you're doing?
is this the right way?
i ...
are you new here?
i don't know if this is the way !
it's going to the island !
i'm almost positive that you're going the wrong way !
open the door !
she said open the door !
you could have taken over his life , but you chose to come back .
you truly are unique , six echo .
my name is lincoln !
i brought you into this world ...
... and i can take you out of it .
