the closet
pignon's got a neat tie !
specially for the photo?
now , please .
please !
must i remind you , this is a company photo !
so smile .
look proud ... to be part of this fine outfit !
the gentleman at bottom left .
with the red tie !
you're not in the frame .
i only see your arm .
move over !
that's fine .
now i've lost the guy on the right !
the zipper jacket's in now !
but i've lost the red tie !
are we going to get this picture?
the red tie's still out !
we've wasted enough time !
everyone , look at me .
were you drunk?
i've never had a framing problem before !
i feel bad for the guy in the red tie .
don't .
he's being fired .
really?
he doesn't know it yet , but he's out .
poor guy .
no , he's an idiot .
am i let go?
only him in accounting .
does he know it?
not yet .
why's he being fired?
staff reduction .
that's lousy .
he's a good man .
i tried to keep him .
he's nice but boring .
no , honest , dedicated .
right , a real drag !
morning , miss bertrand , ariane ...
coffee , anyone?
no , thanks .
did you know?
what?
that i've been fired .
not really .
i'd heard about redundancy .
nothing specific .
poor guy .
yes , it's no fun .
we're not in .
leave us a message .
christine?
frank?
are you there?
pick it up !
he wants you .
you're not in?
frank?
see , he wants you !
that's me?
you're out .
i'll call later .
i can't now .
i'm late .
i'm late too .
no , call me at the office , christine .
i've been fired .
next month , no job .
i found out ... and i wanted to talk to you .
but i'll find a job .
don't worry about your alimony .
see you later .
big hug .
it's me .
i got your message .
i'm not worried .
you'll be okay .
call tomorrow .
i'm out tonight .
i'm not worried .
you'll bounce back .
what are you doing there?
don't move .
enjoy your meal .
i have to go jump out the window .
my wife said i'd bounce back .
we'll soon see .
don't do it .
you'll wreck my car .
i'm parked under your window .
you'll land on it .
it's an old battered car , but the roof s fine .
don't be an idiot .
give me back my cat !
thanks .
it's a silly animal .
like my old car .
i'm fond of it .
i'm new .
i moved in today .
jean pierre belone .
let's toast it .
come for a drink .
it isn't my car , but how else could i stop you?
nor my cat , but it made you open your door .
want it?
then i'll keep it .
good night .
take good care .
i won't leave till i've heard your voice !
silent people scare me .
say one word and i'll leave .
thanks .
come have a drink .
i'm lonely , and no happier than you .
you wanted to die?
don't know .
i may not have the guts .
all because you got fired?
no , my whole life's a mess .
tell me .
i won't bother you with it .
it's so dull .
go on .
there's nothing on tv tonight .
my wife left me two years ago , and i still love her .
my 17 year old son has dropped me .
now i've lost my job .
it was all i had .
fascinating , right?
yes , it is dull .
at least you're frank .
i made you smile .
i found out from santini in personnel .
he's thrilled i got fired !
why?
he never liked me .
he's a jerk !
he broke my collarbone .
made me try out for our rugby team .
you see me playing rugby?
no .
he flattened me .
i got three weeks sick leave .
very funny !
i liked that company .
i was there 20 years .
i won't bore you any longer .
maybe we can save your job .
let me think .
save my job?
you're dreaming !
i'll think it over .
but don't jump .
that's no solution .
of the 123 passengers , none survived .
bad weather has hampered the rescue operation .
in denmark , the ferry that sank off the coast ... is the worst disaster of the decade .
there's talk of 400 casualties .
in indonesia , no news of the 23 tourists kidnapped by guerillas .
an ominous silence !
the weather forecast is no better .
hello .
sorry about the mess .
i'm still moving in .
it's my books .
how will they all fit?
and the closet?
i'm coming .
we have to talk .
meet me down in the caf .
i may have a solution .
i used to be an industrial psychologist .
i know about corporate practices .
if you want to keep your job , you must ...
if i want to keep my job?
come out of the closet .
what?
come out of the closet .
admit you're gay .
but i'm not at all gay !
who cares , if others believe it , especially your boss?
these are recent , before she left me , two years ago .
she's pretty .
what does she do?
translates .
majored in english .
now earns a bit .
but she needs my alimony .
when we met , she was nursing a heartbreak .
i became her confidant .
a dumb role .
she married me as coldly as she left me .
she's so pretty ... and i'm hideous !
you're hardly cute .
you know how to cheer up a guy !
flattery's a no no for depressives .
you're an eyesore with no future and an idiot .
feel better now?
i don't feel any worse .
my problem is my insignificance .
here's my recurrent dream .
i'm being born , but i'm already here .
the doctor hasn't noticed and tells my mom to keep pushing .
i wait in a corner for them to realize i'm here .
the symbolism's pretty obvious .
i'll get them back to you soon .
what are they for?
here .
what's that?
it's you .
with a friend .
we'll shuffle it up .
digital magic !
coming !
did i wake you?
never mind .
did you mail that letter?
yes , last night .
shit !
what's wrong?
i thought it over .
your strategy won't work .
come in .
i can't fake being gay .
i'm no actor .
i'll get exposed !
cup of coffee?
i could use one .
you're right .
if you camp it up , you'll be a flop .
you bet !
it's hard , especially playing a flamer .
most actors who try are way off and vulgar .
so it won't work .
no .
you'll pull it off if you do nothing at all .
just stay the shy , discreet person they've known for years .
what'll change is how they perceive you .
suzanne !
that's pignon !
holy shit !
francoise?
pignon , in accounting , you'll never guess .
wait .
i'll send you a copy .
robert?
you sitting down?
don't hang up .
morning , martine , suzanne .
morning , sir .
how's the mail today?
i'll bring it right in , sir .
well?
i want to know who sent them , and why !
if only there was an anonymous letter ...
don't fire pignon !
we'll tell the media ... you hate gays .
but only these photos .
we're not firing him 'cause he's gay !
but people will say that's why !
i've got nothing against gays !
damn that faggot !
what do we do?
madame ...
gentlemen .
good morning !
before we get down to business , i want you to see these .
they're your sons .
good looking boys !
no , the bare assed guy is an accountant here .
pass them around .
it's pignon !
who took them?
i don't know , but it's hateful .
how surprising !
not to me .
i tried him out at rugby .
you can spot them at once !
broke his collarbone !
had to give up pantyhose !
this is no joke .
we have to solve the pignon problem .
we did .
he's being fired !
what do we make here , santini?
sorry?
what kind of products?
products made of rubber .
what is our star item?
con ...
cond ... ... oms .
if we fire him , we'll have every gay movement on our backs .
better to have them on your back than up .
what do you do saturday nights?
i asked how you spend saturday nights .
gay bashing?
not at all !
where do you go?
the park , to hunt drag queens?
that humor is out now .
i won't say it twice !
i've consulted our pr head .
we keep pignon for now and stay out of his private life !
we must !
he's so dumb .
outdid himself !
let's make him ...
less dumb?
no hope !
we can try !
he let you have it !
i lightened the mood , and he slammed me !
you'd better watch out .
why?
you're on your way out .
he's got his eye on you .
you can't fire a guy for a mild joke !
would they fire me for that?
if i were you , i'd be very nice to pignon .
what do you mean , " very nice "?
you're known as a macho gay basher .
to change that , take pignon to lunch .
i won't lunch with that fruit !
i hope no one heard you .
i can't .
i'm lunching with pignon !
very good .
what a world !
they fire straights and keep on every stinking ...
who copied it?
don't know .
we're all giggling .
put it away .
he's due .
aren't they cute?
get to work !
i had a hunch .
i can spot 'em .
i did him .
it's his walk , his little ways .
i said to myself , " that's one !
i didn't .
it's the way he looks at you ... sideways , round eyed .
like a pigeon .
are pigeons gay?
coffee , anyone?
no , thanks .
no , thanks .
he walks tight assed .
france is no good at rugby?
we played south africa and new zealand .
they're better .
don't kid yourself .
the " all blacks " and " springboks " are way ahead !
they have the super twelve .
okay , they're pros , but in europe ... some of our teams can match them .
felix is right .
we win now and then ... but in the long run ...
you've got a fan !
it's the dating game !
you've got taste .
pignon is mignon !
that humor is out now !
i won't say it twice !
how are you?
fine , thanks .
i'm glad .
you eat beets?
yes .
they're healthy .
i had shredded carrots .
really?
they're healthy too .
i'll have some .
what?
beets .
i'll have some too .
enjoy your meal .
thanks .
listen .
yes?
we should grab a bite someday .
well?
seems to be working .
come in !
santini , " mr. rugby , " asked me to lunch .
that's a good sign .
to your future .
how can i thank you?
i should thank you .
why?
i'm retired .
life isn't much fun .
then you ... suicidal , unemployed ... appear .
thanks to you , now i'm neither .
and i've found the way to full employment .
3 million less unemployed , 3 million more gays with jobs !
there's another thing .
i got fired a long time ago .
now , in a way , i'm getting even .
coming !
that cat never stops eating !
i open tins all day long .
feels like he ate a whole ox today !
why did they fire you?
20 years ago , for the same reason they're keeping you on .
so things are evolving !
move your asses !
push , you fakers !
watch out for those butts !
what'll i say to him?
eating alone with that faggot !
stop saying " faggot " !
you're right !
sorry .
you'll goof up and say , " who needs gays in gay paree?
why would i say that?
that's how you are .
i'm from marseilles , not paris !
okay , forget it .
just be nice to him .
what can i talk about with that sissy?
first , pick a good restaurant .
i did .
the truffle .
costs a fortune !
show him you're not a brute .
say what you love about rugby is the warm locker room camaraderie .
what warm camaraderie?
men together under the showers , naked in the steam ... glistening , muscular bodies .
a buddy soaps your back , you soap his .
it's why you love rugby .
it is?
no , that's just what you tell him !
get rid of your fag bashing image , damn it !
shit .
traffic was awful today .
yes .
and paris traffic can be really awful !
i'm glad you were let go ...
i mean , that it worked out .
thanks .
you're good manpower .
sorry about your mishap at rugby .
i've forgotten it .
people think i'm just a big brute ... but i'm as sensitive as the next guy .
i love rugby for the showers .
really?
the showers?
not the actual showers .
you can shower anywhere .
sure .
how can i put it?
a shower with a naked buddy .
get me?
no .
sure you do .
you're with a naked buddy in the shower , soaping his ...
now what is it?
picked a wine , sir?
give me the wine list !
where was i?
soaping your buddy in the shower .
i was?
right , i was .
red or white?
not at lunch , or i doze at work .
i'll drink .
makes me gay .
i didn't mean it that way .
shit .
christine , you there?
i had lunch with santini .
now my job looks safe again .
but i've had no news from frank in two weeks .
a cop's stopping me for phoning and driving .
i'll call you .
you need a " hands free " model , sir .
i've ordered one , officer .
driver's license .
don't ticket me for that .
i phoned my wife about our son .
he's at a tricky age .
you got kids , officer?
not when i'm on duty .
my son avoids me .
i never see him .
last saturday , i waited all day .
i ticketed an old lady .
she cried over her dead dog .
next , a girl sobbed over her boyfriend .
let me do my job !
leave me out of your problems !
he was my kid .
now , he's a stranger .
move on .
get lost !
well?
you scared me !
how'd it go?
very well .
he had duck .
i had a nice stew .
skip what you ate .
i was the essence of tact .
we chatted delightfully !
i acted like an old queen with that sissy !
now he thinks i grab guys in the showers !
no one can hear us !
damn your paranoia !
i'm ashamed of myself .
i'm through with that fruit !
you okay?
fine .
and you?
who were you talking about?
what?
i thought i heard " fruit .
we didn't say " fruit . " did we?
absolutely not .
shit !
what?
he heard every word !
so what?
he's a pal .
but he gabs to victor , who gabs to the boss .
will the spade rat on me?
now what?
if you're a racist too !
i am not !
is " spade " a nice word?
i meant no harm .
go away .
i'll get fired too .
listen to me !
watch out !
he hardly waved .
at our lunch , he was cold with me .
the harder i tried , the more he clammed up .
it was awful .
you didn't go far enough .
he sensed you were faking it .
they're intuitive .
should i have taken him to a disco?
show him you're his friend , that you love him .
that i love him?
he was destroyed !
i want to hear him declare his love !
you're laying it on too thick .
he called you a spade .
he did?
he said he meant no harm .
okay , give it all you've got !
harder !
push !
get into it !
you're a bunch of sissies !
let's see if you've got balls !
that's standard rugby talk !
don't bug me for that !
i didn't say a thing .
now anything i say ...
people think you took the photos of pignon .
i heard it too .
is it true?
no way !
really?
what's this crap?
you hate gays 'cause you're a latent one .
who says that?
i had a strategy .
you turned it down !
what strategy?
if they call you gay 'cause you hate gays ... hang out with one to show you're not gay !
could you say that slower?
thursday is his birthday .
it is?
giving fran?
ois pignon a gift would be smart !
he was seen in the park last night .
a guy in sales , driving through , saw him half naked .
look at that flamer !
how are things?
fine .
and you?
i'm due at maintenance .
later !
later !
i hear he's hot for an office boy .
i'll hurry !
bastard's a pedophile too !
yesterday , he was a bore .
today , a pervert .
he hid it well .
i've worked six years with him .
it's tales .
he's no sex freak .
what about him grabbing ass in those photos?
you still got them?
something's odd .
what?
no gay wears bare ass lederhosen now !
those photos are 20 years old !
maybe they're into nostalgia .
it's not him .
what?
see the spot on his arm?
look .
in short sleeves , he has no snake tattoo .
maybe it's recent .
or a decal .
his arm isn't that muscular .
it's not him .
then who?
they're manipulated photos .
why make him look like a faggot?
i don't know , but it's not him .
let's get his shirt off .
what?
to check out the tattoo .
easy !
you say , " i want to see your strong arms .
get undressed !
no , we shout , " take it off , pignon !
take it all off !
hello again !
still no one for coffee?
no , thanks .
think he heard?
i hope not .
i've got an idea .
now what?
i bump into him with his coffee .
his shirt is drenched , he removes it ...
you can't stain his shirt !
why not?
that's unfair !
damn his shirt .
at least we'll know !
i'm so sorry !
i feel awful .
look at your blouse .
i'm sorry .
better take it off .
wasn't me .
she bumped into me .
no , it wasn't your fault .
i'll get myself another coffee .
mr. pignon !
yes?
mind staying late tonight?
to finish the balance sheet .
no problem .
if we run late , we'll order food and eat here .
okay?
if i add sales tax , the figures match .
congratulations .
let's quit .
you're tired .
we're not quite done .
we'll do it later .
let's break and eat .
a new invention .
try it .
thanks .
about the august sub balance .
if we carried over the premiums ...
we're having dinner !
we'll work later .
sorry .
in six years , it's our first dinner together .
yes , our first .
easy on the wine .
i can't handle it .
to our first dinner !
i'm glad you kept your job .
thanks .
and the reason why ... shows people are changing .
you mind discussing it?
what?
the reason you were kept on .
no , why would i mind?
wait .
are you sure you know the reason?
they figured i wasn't such a lousy accountant !
you don't know about the photos?
what photos?
i shouldn't discuss it , but everyone's seen them .
the boss got photos of you going into a gay bar ... in a compromising position .
they were meant to harm you , but it backfired .
that's how you held on to your job .
easy on the wine .
this food's salty .
i'm thirsty .
i didn't fall for it .
what?
they'd been manipulated .
it was a montage .
a montage?
i've known you for a while .
that can't be you in those photos .
i've known you through a marriage , a divorce .
i can't believe it .
is that you ... bare assed in lederhosen , being fondled by a guy?
yes , it's me .
mind you , it didn't shock me .
we're all entitled to privacy , but it surprised me .
and not just me .
i drank too much .
i need to lie down .
are you all right?
it's nothing .
i'll be fine .
we'll get back to work .
sorry .
i didn't realize anyone was here .
i undid your collar so you could breathe .
sorry .
i have to go .
mr. pignon !
see you tomorrow .
'night !
she tried to undress you?
i drank too much .
when i woke up , she had undone my shirt .
are you two an item?
we're just coworkers !
what got into her?
are you hot for her?
she's pretty , smart , has men at her feet .
why would she want me?
because you're not a man .
what?
reclaiming a gay man turns some women on .
not her !
she didn't fall for it , asked me questions ...
about what?
she thinks the photos were manipulated .
i settled that .
wasn't easy .
i had to look her in the eye and say i liked men .
i came out of a closet i never went into .
maybe , but now you're in deep shit .
why?
that woman undressing you isn't good .
she may blow your cover .
does she care if i'm gay?
it's dangerous .
we must counterattack .
have a seat , pignon .
thank you , sir .
you asked to see me?
yes .
it's tricky .
it's about miss bertrand .
i'm listening .
tell her to stop fondling me .
sorry?
she's after me .
it's unpleasant .
after you?
how?
she assaulted me ... sexually .
i see .
almost tore off my shirt last night .
she shouldn't do that .
she's my boss , but i'm not an object , sir .
i understand .
i'll look into it .
thank you , sir .
don't be rough on her .
i just want to be left alone .
i'll look into it .
joint's okay but pricey .
i can't digest red peppers .
isn't that pignon?
yes .
what's he doing here?
holy shit !
what?
the fairy's ogling teenage boys !
dirty fruitcake !
frank !
i was nearby , so i decided to surprise you .
how are you?
fine .
and you?
fine , but i never see you .
i waited last week .
i couldn't come .
i was busy .
you should call .
i waited .
sure .
gotta go .
coming for lunch saturday?
sure .
he was ogling boys .
it turned my stomach !
i should've kicked his ass !
he'd love that !
the guy's revolting , unhealthy !
my kid could be pawed by that scumbag !
if i were a man and as tough as you guys are ...
i would definitely teach him a lesson .
you wanted to see me , sir?
sit down , miss bertrand .
it's about pignon .
yes?
it's a bit tricky .
you must stop fondling him .
sorry?
he's accused you of sexual harassment .
he accused me of ...
that faggot !
precisely .
sexual harassment?
since he doesn't like women , leave him alone !
yes , sir .
tons of men in this company would love to be harassed by you !
i'll go for a breather .
what you did to her is disgusting !
i didn't do anything ...
you behaved like an old biddy !
soon you'll have no friends here !
fran?
ois?
it's for you .
what is it?
open it !
happy birthday , fran?
ois .
hope you like the color , but you can change it .
you okay?
yeah .
sure you had no school?
yeah .
you should see your dad more often .
that thing'll make you a zombie !
you don't even answer his calls .
he's no longer my husband ... but he's still your father !
i'm not an idiot .
you left him ...
'cause he's a drag .
he still is , so i dodge him .
now please leave me alone .
tell him you hate his pasta .
i don't hate it .
if you don't , where's the problem?
it's how he says , " tomato and basil pasta !
that's him .
we won't change him .
can i go next week instead?
don't annoy me !
tomato and basil pasta !
smells delicious !
sweet of you to invite me .
i'd made too much for myself .
delicious !
may i say ... it lacks a little basil .
what it lacks is the presence of my son .
things okay?
sure .
nice day at the office?
ice !
i asked a question .
yes , fine .
water !
want to hear about my day?
i'm back from work .
i'm bushed .
lay off me .
what is it?
you've been odd all week .
you don't answer me or you get mad .
what is it , hon?
nothing .
i'm fine .
good bye .
what's this bill?
the cashmere house .
one sweater , $110 !
you bought one?
yes .
so what?
you got a cashmere sweater?
they also sell lisle .
it was on sale . $110 !
that's cheap?
it was for that color .
what color?
pink .
you gonna grill me long?
i want to see it .
is it in your closet?
no , i checked .
stop poisoning my life !
admit you bought a sweater for a bimbo !
a sweater for a bimbo?
she's nuts !
so put it on .
i want to see you in it .
who's this girl?
this gift wasn't for a girl .
then for who?
a guy at the plant .
a pink sweater for a guy at the plant?
he's gay .
it was his birthday .
now leave me alone .
you gave a sweater to a gay guy?
who is this girl?
did you watch tv last night?
no , i ate at my sister in law's .
there was a great movie .
a girl falls for a guy .
turns out he's her dad .
that's rough .
when the chick screamed , " daddy ! " ... she was so moving .
little bitch had great tits too !
really nice ones?
some cleavage !
finding out the chick you want to lay is your daughter !
that's a real human interest story .
here he comes !
what happened?
two guys in the garage ...
i'll call the police .
no point .
we'll get the bastards .
they wore hoods and stole nothing .
i'll take you to the hospital .
i'll be okay .
i thought those days were over .
you again !
because you showed up ...
i'm in this mess ... pretending to be what i'm not , getting beaten up .
i'd be out of work , but whole .
hear that , puss?
you seduced an old queer , wrecked his neighbor's life .
look what you've done to him , puss .
make fun of me too !
would you rather i wept?
heard the latest?
now what?
he got beaten up in his garage .
two hooded guys .
broken collarbone .
wasn't me .
i was home .
i didn't say that it was .
was he robbed?
no , just beat up .
a way to say they hate gays .
that's disgusting .
is he in the hospital?
i think he's at home .
should i call him?
if you want , yes .
if he's all alone at home , i'd better go see him .
don't lose any sleep .
it can't be that bad .
agnes won't speak to me .
who?
my wife .
because i bought him a sweater .
would you give chocolates?
to your wife?
no , to pignon .
we went too far .
maybe he's in love .
i'm not kidding .
he looked odd .
if he looked less dumb , that's progress .
he's figured it out .
now he's putting you on .
he may be more fragile than we thought .
who are they for?
what are you doing here?
we have to talk .
shit , my chocolates !
you followed me?
yes .
'cause of a girl?
if you knew ...
i do .
you're courting a gay man to keep your job .
that's worse than a girlfriend .
i can't give him these .
you buy that faggot sweaters and chocolates !
next a venice weekend !
don't tail me !
i'll do what i want !
leave me alone !
you're sick .
you need help .
you'll wind up feeding that man chocolates .
they're wrecked !
he'll ask you to lie beside him .
no chance of that .
how do you know?
i'm not his type .
he avoids my eyes .
he never wore my sweater .
i don't appeal to him .
come home .
you need help .
i love you .
i need a candy store .
i can't give him these .
if you go up to his place , i'll leave you .
there must be a candy store .
felix !
had a problem?
nothing serious .
fran?
ois pignon?
the boss wants to see you .
come up now .
the boss?
i'll be right up .
my dear fran?
ois , have a seat !
you're hurt?
it's nothing .
glad to hear it .
we're going to need you .
moreau's come up with a good publicity stunt .
he'll tell you .
go ahead .
as you may know , next saturday is gay pride day .
what?
the day you guys have a big parade .
radio and tv , all the media cover it now .
i suggested that we should be in on it .
i was reluctant .
we still have a few heterosexual customers .
but your parade is now so accepted socially .
we've got a float in the parade ... with a banner and a big condom .
i thought you'd like to be on the float .
me?
we've got a " come out safely " t shirt .
and this hat to top it off .
a perfect fit !
isn't he cute?
how you doing?
we're fine , but he isn't .
his wife left him .
shit .
we've been assholes .
hi , felix .
you okay?
fine , sure .
i have to talk to you .
i'll come clean .
i kidded you .
your job was always safe .
i had fun scaring you , but only so you'd evolve .
some of us disapproved of your macho attitude .
so we said , " let's tone him down .
see?
we heard your wife left you .
we feel bad .
no need .
we want your wife to come home again .
not too mad at me?
i'm not mad at you .
why should i be?
good .
we love you .
we were just teasing .
so you're shy .
you'll overcome that .
you're the man for that float , no?
but crowds , spotlights , parades aren't my thing .
the ceo will be upset if you refuse .
it was his idea .
agnes moved out .
what?
my wife left me .
now i live alone .
really?
i need an answer fast .
agnes has left me .
i'm alone .
yes , i heard you .
want a coffee?
you want to live with me?
i'm alone .
we could live together .
no .
why?
because .
it took eight people to control him .
he went berserk .
poor fellow .
he's in the hospital with a nervous breakdown .
what a day !
you better?
yes .
as to that parade , if i were you , i'd go .
that's easy for you to say .
what a dumb answer .
if you go ... you'll become irreplaceable , a kind of icon .
yes , an icon .
in a parade of flamers .
wearing a condom bonnet .
so what?
i'll be a dickhead .
to you it's funny .
screw your parade !
as you like .
i'm tired .
i'm going to bed .
sorry .
i was tactless , but i'm lost too .
more has happened in the last few days than in my whole life .
don't exaggerate .
one coworker undressed me .
another wanted me to move in , then almost strangled me .
i got beat up in my garage .
next , i parade with fags and dykes .
need i say more?
your life's been very dull .
at last , you're coming alive .
don't quit halfway .
good to see you , darling .
you okay , dad?
fine .
come in , frank .
sit down .
i've made you a snack .
tomato and basil pasta .
i wasn't expecting your message .
i haven't heard from you in a month .
you're not eating?
i'm not hungry .
i'm fine .
i'm really fine .
i saw you on tv .
it was luck .
i rarely watch daytime tv .
that's why you came over?
i had to see you .
why?
it made me want to see you .
you see dad in a parade of flamers and say , " i'll pop over .
no , i said , " maybe i misread dad .
great pasta .
maybe you misread me?
i said , maybe he's not such a ...
a drag?
yes ...
i mean more fun .
now you think i'm fun?
don't know .
i'm just glad to be with you .
that parade today , me on a float with that banner ...
it was brilliant .
what did you want to say?
nothing .
i'm glad you came .
tell me ... are you attracted to ...
to what?
you mean , to boys?
why , is it hereditary?
i'm not kidding .
answer me .
no .
i'm into girls .
pity , we'll never parade together .
what's that?
good stuff .
you smoke that crap?
sometimes , not often .
don't worry .
does your mom know?
i said i rarely do .
only when i feel great .
tonight we both feel great , right?
we feel great , but don't smoke this crap .
why so late?
i was worried sick !
i was with dad .
what?
i had dinner with dad .
don't lie to me .
i swear we had dinner .
did you leave him 'cause he's gay?
what?
you could've told me .
are you drunk?
i taped it .
i missed the start , but he's brilliant .
we're not in , but leave us a message .
christine , it's me .
you there?
you're not in?
you're there .
it's so good to hear you .
you okay?
very well .
i had dinner with frank .
he told me .
did he tell you about ...
yes .
i'm watching it on tv .
a rerun?
what channel?
no , he recorded it .
what is all this?
don't bug him .
he's found his thing .
he's happy .
stay out of it .
go to bed .
have you become gay?
it's a complicated story .
don't bug him .
he was cool tonight .
not uptight ...
get off my back !
no , that was for frank , not you .
can we meet?
sure we can .
dinner one night this week?
she'll bug the hell out of him .
shut your trap !
and she's crude too .
i'll call tomorrow to say which night .
i saw my son .
i'm dining with my wife .
you're a genius !
i'm happy for you .
what's happened?
you look down .
the cat ran away .
where to?
it left no forwarding address .
of course .
may i come in?
why am i so upset?
it wasn't here long .
such an ordinary cat .
don't worry .
we'll find it .
i'll put up posters all over with a description .
a description?
yes , its particulars .
okay , describe it to me .
what?
describe the cat to me .
it's small , gray ...
yes , they're sure to find it .
add that it meows now and again .
you lived with it .
aren't there any markings?
nothing .
you couldn't find a more anonymous alley cat .
but i'm glad about your son and your wife .
i'll find your cat .
i'll search every alley around .
morning .
morning .
how are you?
just fine .
what is it?
nothing .
are you sure?
yes .
why?
a dark look from you , the boss's secretary ...
things are fine .
miss bertrand .
the ceo is planning ... to promote pignon .
coffee , anyone?
no coffee .
you knew?
knew what?
i've been fired .
the parade boosted the company's image .
you've got my job as head accountant .
they can't fire you like that .
officially , it's sexual harassment .
nice going .
i want to see the ceo .
he's busy .
sorry , but i have to talk to you .
call you back .
i've called security .
no need .
got a problem?
yes .
i heard i was being promoted .
news travels fast here .
there is talk of promoting you .
but that can't be it .
you cannot fire miss bertrand .
she's an excellent head accountant .
fire me .
it's okay .
no one's being fired .
anyone for coffee?
yes .
i'd like some coffee .
me too .
three coffees coming right up .
pignon !
you okay , felix?
you came to see me , wearing my sweater !
it's lovely .
i get compliments .
i thought you'd like this key ring .
a little rugby ball !
that's neat !
i started a team here , but the depressives were too weepy .
that's a shame .
crying in a scrum , you can't see the ball .
come back to work .
i can't .
i was fired .
no , the boss agrees , we'll never find a personnel man like you .
or such a good rugby coach .
don't , fran?
ois .
my eyes are moist , like a fairy .
sorry .
no harm done .
come back soon .
promise?
i promise .
it's too pink .
makes you look silly .
exchange it .
see you soon .
what time's the party?
ready !
he's coming !
there's a party for me?
don't think so .
i knew it , you did .
i feel ill .
why?
i'm still shaky .
i feel weak .
it'll be fine .
give me your hand .
is pignon holding santini's hand?
he is !
congratulations , felix .
pignon and santini .
who could've guessed?
what are you doing here?
hanging around .
i didn't feel like going home .
and you?
i followed you , to thank you .
there's no need .
and to apologize .
what for?
for six years i saw you as a dullard ... with no brawn or brains , no balls , nothing .
no need .
that's how everyone sees me .
one day , i saw a photo of you , bare assed , being felt up by a gay .
here , they found it amazing or amusing .
i figured , it's a crafty ploy to keep his job .
you were right .
no , i was wrong .
you'd found a ploy , but you're not a dullard .
you're a fine man .
convincing you of that is the best way to thank you .
convincing me will be quite a chore .
i promise to do my best .
i'm dining with my wife tomorrow .
she left me two years ago , never saw me .
now she's agreed , intrigued by this gay thing .
i'm scared of being alone with her .
i'll be hopeless .
has she replaced you?
several times .
several times isn't serious .
have you had an affair?
no .
other women don't interest me .
that's not good .
why?
won't help you get her back .
women spot a lonely man .
it drives them away .
they also sense when a man has known many women ... and it excites them .
if it's just to thank me ...
you got any protection?
no .
me , neither .
usually i have some in my purse ...
these are our assembly lines and our packaging lines .
and those ...
those are our testers .
madame .
morning , gentlemen .
i'm confused about pignon's sexuality .
things okay?
amazing .
i waited so long for this .
what's this place?
a guy from the office took me here .
it's a bit rustic .
a bit .
you don't like it?
rich food .
i'll have a salad .
shall we move?
i just came for an explanation .
go ahead .
you only came for that?
why else?
sure .
care for a drink , folks?
champagne?
no , bottled water .
yes , madame .
for you , sir?
glass of champagne .
what's all this that you're gay?
for two years , i was so terribly stuck on you .
mornings , waking without you .
i'd talk all day to you .
at night , sleepless , i'd still talk to you .
i only quit when i phoned you .
you never answered .
let's not go over all that again .
in my head , i asked you why you'd left me ... when i loved you so much ... and i had tried so hard to make you happy .
i saw shrinks who said i was an obsessive compulsive .
they named my pain but couldn't cure it .
god , how i loved you .
i agreed to come because i saw you in a gay parade .
you said you'd explain .
i will .
don't worry .
i'm happy .
i'm really happy tonight .
why?
i've realized how unpleasant you are .
you're amazingly unpleasant , i'd even say .
and forgive my frankness ... but you're totally uninteresting .
if you invited me to insult me ...
don't get mad .
i'm just starting to breathe .
after two years , i'm breathing again .
i choked in my obsessive period .
i forgot who you were ... an ungenerous woman who never gave me any love ... not even a tiny bit .
you're so uninteresting , and now i'm so happy .
that's it .
i'm leaving .
i'm not gay .
i did it for my job and your alimony .
pretending not to like women , i became a man .
call your son .
fill him in on this hoax .
for three days he's treated you like a hero .
you mind?
what?
that he no longer scorns me , that i interest him .
it bothers you?
a boy shouldn't admire his dad for acting like a fag .
telling him will be a letdown .
i'll tell him .
things will be fine again .
sorry , you're dining alone .
we smoked a joint together .
what?
hash .
it was good stuff .
my head was putty the next day .
what did you say?
i forbid you to tell him what i really am .
he's at a critical stage .
we'll tell him later .
i want contact .
you're raising him wrong .
he needs a father , gay or straight .
you decided , folks?
i'll have some rich , heavy food .
madame won't .
i'm dining alone .
good night .
it's been lovely .
amazing !
i can't believe it .
i said i'd find it .
it was on your balcony?
yes .
i heard meows and ...
when?
a while ago .
funny , i didn't hear a thing .
i did it .
i'm over my wife .
that's good news .
our dinner ...
it wasn't " ours .
she didn't eat .
sure it's the same cat?
what?
there's something different .
like what?
i can't describe it .
the other was very plain .
so's this one .
that proves nothing .
either way .
you're not the same man .
i don't know which is which .
i'll get to the point , pignon .
i don't know where things stand with you .
two months ago , you come out of the closet .
you agree?
yes , sir .
then you accused miss bertrand of sexual harassment .
you still agree?
yes , sir .
later , i catch you making wild love ... on an assembly line with that same miss bertrand ... in front ofjapanese clients ... who now want to visit the plant again .
you think it's funny .
i don't .
you pretended to be gay to hold on to your job .
you're a liar , pignon .
you're right , sir , i'm a liar .
i'm not gay .
do i apply for unemployment?
that's not the right approach .
yes , it is , sir .
gay or straight , you're a pain , pignon .
my whole life i've been called a drag .
you called me a pain .
that's a step up the ladder .
one year later ...
all right , please .
please !
a company photo .
so everyone smiles ... happy to be in this fine outfit .
the man down on the left .
you in the blue suit .
i'm not in the frame?
you okay?
shit , my collarbone !
okay , fire away .
