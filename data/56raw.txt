it's a thuggee ceremony .
they're worshipping kali .
have you ever seen anything like this before?
nobody's seen this for a hundred years .
kali ma .
kali ma ...
kali ma !
he's still alive .
kali ma .
kali ma ...
that's the rock they took from the village .
it's one of the sankara stones .
why they glow like that?
shh , shh .
the legend says when the rocks are brought together , the diamonds inside them will glow .
diamonds?
diamonds .
diamonds !
shh .
diamonds .
hey , hey .
look , i want you two to stay up here and keep quiet .
shorty , you keep an eye on her .
why , where are you going?
down there .
down there? !
are you crazy? !
i'm not leaving here without the stones .
you could get killed chasing after your damn fortune and glory !
maybe .
but not today .
be careful .
where's he going?
let me go ... !
run , willie !
run !
dr. jones !
i keep telling you , you listen me more , you live longer .
please , let me die .
i pray to siva ,
let me die , " but i do not .
now ... now the evil of kali take me .
how?
they will make me drink the blood of the kali .
then i'll fall into the black sleep of the kali ma .
what is that?
we become like them .
we'll be alive , but like a nightmare .
you drink blood , you not wake up from nightmare .
you were caught trying to steal the sankara stones .
there were five stones in the beginning .
over the centuries , they were dispersed by wars , sold off by thieves like you .
thieves like me , huh?
ha !
still missing two .
a century ago , when the british raided this temple and butchered my people , a loyal priest hid the last two stones down here in the catacombs .
so that's what you've got these slaves digging for , huh?
they're innocent children .
they dig for the gems to support our cause .
they also search for the last two stones .
soon we will have all the five sankara stones , and the thuggees will be all powerful .
what a vivid imagination .
you ... don't believe me?
you will , dr. jones .
you will become ... a true believer .
hi .
dr. jones !
don't drink ... it's bad !
don't drink !
spit it out !
dr. jones ...
you dare not do that .
leave him alone , you bastards !
the british in india will be slaughtered .
then we will overrun the muslims .
then the hebrew god will fall .
and then the christian god will be cast down and forgotten .
soon , kali ma will rule the world .
dr. jones ...
kali ma protects us .
we are her children .
we pledge our devotion to her with an offering of flesh ...
what are you doing? !
... and blood .
your friend has seen ... and she has heard .
now she will not talk .
i'm not going to have anything nice to say about this place when i get back .
indy !
for god sakes , help me !
wh what's the matter with you?
