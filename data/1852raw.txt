i'm not trying to be difficult , but ...
so many nice things .
music , a big house ...
aren't we good enough?
not posh enough?
are you any better?
they will have every opportunity with us .
be honest .
i'm not saying that we're any better than you , but really ...
you can have the sick one .
just the sick one .
final offer .
it's a disgrace .
twins belong together .
be quiet , ferdinand .
we'll go along with it .
everyone will get something .
not bad , eh , jet?
it turns with the sun .
no swiss sanatorium could match it .
for you .
for you .
we're going to get lotje well again .
lotte is going to be well cared for in her new country .
go on .
when is lotte coming?
when you've finished .
start at the front .
not all in one go .
lotte won't be coming .
she has consumption .
so that's that .
look , this is my mummy .
she's not alive anymore .
just like your mummy .
and now i'm your new mummy .
give me that handkerchief .
you know these words , don't you?
handkerchief?
mummy?
say 'mummy '.
they are dutch words .
say it .
dear lotte , when are you coming?
what are you writing?
a letter .
to whom?
lotte .
and where will you send it to?
holland .
do you know the address?
she thinks we know the address .
we don't have the address either .
they don't want us to know it .
afraid we'll drop by .
stuck up lot .
maybe lotte will write to you .
lf she's still alive .
dear anna .
tomorrow i will get on the train and come to you .
tomorrow i will be with you again .
you'll never guess what delicious things i've got here .
that's good .
write a nice letter to your sister .
later .
after your meal .
dinand?
we have to decide now .
do we send it?
and then?
she'll want to go there when she's better .
and then they'll keep her .
i can't bear to see it .
they're barbarians , jetje .
stupid farmers .
stupid , catholic farmers .
do you want her to grow up there?
no .
she has to forget anna .
believe me , jetje .
for her own good .
she simply has to forget anna .
why is there no letter?
harder .
no .
because there won't be a letter .
why not?
i'll tell you some day .
go on .
no .
lotte doesn't want anything to do with you .
she thinks you're stupid and dirty .
and besides , she's dead .
sweetie ...
did something make you call out for anna?
shall i tell you about anna?
you understand me perfectly , don't you?
clever little girl .
anna is living with the barbarians .
they are really stupid people who have no stationery ... and that's why there is never a letter .
but not to worry .
anna is very happy with the barbarians .
she likes it there .
with all the animals ...
and she wants lotte to be happy , too .
anna doesn't want lotte to cry .
you have to go to sleep now .
sleep well .
sleep well .
sleep well , anna .
what is it now?
what do you want?
i want to have a bath .
what's with the girl?
i want to have a bath .
ls she getting milk?
the milk is to sell .
and why don't i see her in school?
really?
she doesn't seem that way to me .
ln fact , she seems rather clever .
what is it?
'the grace of help is a supernatural assistance ... through which god lightens our understanding and moves us ... to shun evil and do good . '
i want to go to school .
you're coming with me .
my hands , you see .
i don't play the piano any more .
both hands?
only the right .
arm and hand .
i have everything low in the kitchen .
but other than that ...
my biggest passion was gardening .
now , my grandson comes and weeds for me .
that's nice too .
we just have to make the best of it .
i'll see you tomorrow .
what's wrong with you?
arthritis?
me , too .
i have that , too .
it runs in our family .
oh , well .
not in mine .
yes , it does .
it does .
it certainly does .
lottchen .
why are you looking in the mirror?
your father had consumption .
so did your sister .
and your mother had cancer .
but i'm still alive .
our lord , the most splendid of all so gentle and so kind beautiful lips
our lot has been on the radio twice already .
with a choir .
purposeful and determined
like there in the blue depths bright and shiny , every star
our lord , in my heaven
it's not about you , you know .
sing , sing .
third year conservatory .
i'm a rotten player .
go on .
the farmer who marries you ...
does not exist .
oh no?
no .
i won't marry a farmer .
i won't be a farmer's wife .
what then?
i want to go to school and then to university .
go to the blacksmith .
we're busy .
busy?
do i have to go myself?
you have a beautiful voice .
are you coming to the conservatory?
no , i'm going to study german .
pity .
why?
why german?
i think german is a beautiful language .
are you the milkman's?
you don't look like your sisters at all .
yet they're sisters all the same .
lmagine .
you're much more beautiful .
the axle of our hay cart . ls it ready?
not yet .
what are you doing?
he looks like he wants to fight .
he does .
fight for us .
for all of us .
against unemployment and against poverty .
that man has big plans for us .
it's incredible ... that this hitler , this mudslinger , is so successful .
germany , germany ...
it's in the papers every day .
i'm sick of it sometimes .
our bram has just returned from germany .
oh really?
yes .
a born raconteur , my brother .
they said that you had to go to germany for proper training in violin making .
and?
he was back after fourteen days , devastated .
why?
oh , i don't know ...
i can listen to him for hours .
tell us , go on .
it's just not easy to get a position there .
for jews , he means .
he was given the cold shoulder everywhere he went .
we're no longer welcome there .
oh , you shouldn't take those nazis too seriously , you know .
we belong to the first class , did you know that?
farmers belong to the first class .
lf he succeeds , everything will be better .
then you can take on a workman and i can go to school .
who gave you this paper?
bernd miler .
he told me all this .
bernd miler is an idiot .
we are catholics .
adolf hitler is fighting for us .
it says so right there .
you'll get a workman , i'll go to school .
never let me catch you near that boy .
why?
i only want to go to school .
never let me catch you near that bastard , you hear me?
so that's how they do it .
enlisting young people .
ldiots .
bunch of sheep .
and you're falling for this as well .
never again , do you hear?
lf i ever catch you near that stupid ass ...
let them talk , ignorant farmers .
your uncle is an ignorant farmer .
obedient catholics .
they don't know any better .
like animals who have lived too long in a cage .
open the door and they stay inside .
what has the church ever done for us?
do you want to spend the rest of your life in filth?
we'll do it differently .
lf there were more women like you we'd have the new germany in no time .
well , what do you think?
nice .
i've joined , anna .
a new order , and i'm part of it .
you should join as well .
yes .
do you want to make me happy?
and germany?
and our fhrer?
i want to go to grammar school .
i'll build you a house .
with a gable roof .
and shutters .
a bavarian veranda .
and a solid oak door .
i have to go home .
they don't know where i am .
and there's a storm coming .
heinrich , come here .
anna kissed him .
would you have dared if your father were still alive?
would you?
would you have dared if your father were still alive?
come here , you .
answer me .
what's wrong?
separating twins ... what an idea .
it's just criminal .
i've written so many letters .
sitting up in my bed ...
'anna , where are you .
anna , write back .
anna , anna , anna ... '
but she never replied .
i talked to her in my head .
they thought i was a quiet child , but i was talking all day .
like this i can see both of you .
but which one is anna?
why don't you visit her?
she never gave me a sign she was alive .
shall i go with you?
i'll go with you .
david , you cannot talk about this .
we never talk about it at home .
why not?
i told you .
now you must forget it again .
that does it .
i'm taking you away from here .
st. joseph's domestic science school
that cupboard on monday morning , i told you .
the outside only .
and the floor?
i wanted to do that later .
come here , girl .
i check everything myself , like this .
there can be no dust , no dirt anywhere .
so no rest until all the dirt is gone .
it's a struggle .
dust plagues our lives .
and don't forget the portrait of our fhrer .
i can't find it .
schumann .
higher , i think .
that's not very gentlemanly .
no , it's not .
what is that?
it's cruel .
all those letters .
my sister .
how could you?
something so terrible .
you don't know what you're talking about .
where are her letters?
or did you throw them away?
no , darling .
no ...
give me those letters then .
no letter ever came .
why not?
did she know where i lived?
all that time she was waiting for a letter from me?
who would do such a thing?
why?
explain it to me .
we saved you from a bunch of illiterate barbarians .
why didn't you save her then?
you were sick .
and if you had gone to visit anna , they would have kept you there .
your life wouldn't have been as nice .
i would have still had my sister .
you would now both be marching behind mr hitler , waving flags .
does she still live there?
with the barbarians?
why?
because i'm going to her .
you don't always have to spend your evening off in your room .
i don't mind .
come and join us .
take a seat .
of course we're not going to just sit here .
every young woman should master that .
go on .
herr stolz?
do you think i could read a book?
of course .
do you have any preferences?
the sorrows of young werther .
goethe?
but that's far too difficult .
have you read it?
no , but ...
well , then let her .
nowadays , culture belongs to everyone .
hereditary health department .
could we have a word with you?
according to our information , you have a servant called anna bamberg .
may we come in?
what about anna bamberg?
as you know , anna bamberg is mentally retarded .
she looks quite normal , i thought .
yes , yes .
that's not unusual .
but these papers leave no doubts .
what do you want from her?
you know the government is looking to solve the problem of retarded people?
it has been decided that anna bamberg is to be sterilized .
sterilized?
such things are hereditary , madam .
surely you know that .
anna bamberg , retarded?
it's right here in the guardianship deed .
'anna bamberg , foster daughter of heinrich and martha , is retarded ... and too delicate of health to be educated .
she is so weak ... '
that they had to keep her home from school .
and so on .
read for yourself .
he was paid?
she's right in front of you , anna bamberg .
i'm the delicate , retarded girl you're looking for .
i could read and write when i was six years old .
my uncle kept me home to work for him for free .
he allowed his wife to terrorize me , he beat me up .
and no one ...
no one ever came to check whether what he'd written was true .
and now you're going to sterilize me?
i've had quite enough of this .
out .
get out .
don't you worry .
i won't break any more of your vases .
you know what your problem is?
you have ideas above your station .
good luck .
you're a servant and you always will be .
my dear sister .
this is my first letter to you , but also my hundredth .
i'm writing this with thumping heart , because i think , dear anna ... that we will see each other again soon .
i have found you .
so you're still alive .
lotte ...
what a surprise .
i've asked myself a hundred times why you didn't write .
we were both lied to .
your letter took five weeks to get here .
dear anna , do you know where you're going yet?
i'm tutoring in german .
i have nearly enough for the trip .
will you write to me?
dear lotte .
your letter came yesterday , after eight weeks .
it was opened at customs .
i have a new position .
near cologne , with a countess .
we live in a villa with a swimming pool .
can you imagine?
the countess is a beautiful woman .
and she smells so nice , of powder and cigarettes .
are you coming soon?
i've gone ahead and bought one .
i have to go to the station .
today?
that's completely impossible .
but i told you .
my sister .
not now .
i can't do without you .
you're the only one who keeps her head .
but you promised .
careful with the chandelier .
please .
oh , dear ...
how will you get to the station?
gnther .
hermann , take over from him .
but quickly .
hurry .
do you remember me?
everything .
your eyebrows ...
everything .
your eyes .
daddy's eyes .
this car belongs to the countess .
everyone else's cars are commandeered .
nice car .
you can only stay one night .
i couldn't reach you .
everything has changed again .
we're heading east .
the countess is afraid .
afraid that the english will start bombing us .
there she is .
charlotte von garlitz dublow , countess of falkenau .
they have an old castle on the oder .
that's where we're going .
beautiful , isn't she?
ls this all right?
when do you have to leave?
tomorrow morning .
the countess can't do without me .
tomorrow?
yes .
pity .
the war ...
i have to go downstairs .
what about me?
can i come?
i'll help you .
why not?
you'll find out what a proper maid's life is like .
you're like a board .
as straight as an arrow .
thanks .
not too tight?
i taught them .
come .
why are they here?
they're on leave .
guests of the count .
hannele .
my sister .
my sister lotte .
i don't know what it's like there or how long we'll stay .
it's madness , but we're taking everything with us .
the whole family is dining here .
plus spouses and children .
the officers ... the guests ...
let me think ...
who is serving?
we used to have the same glasses .
hannele and l .
and lotte .
hermann will pour the wine .
did we have crystal?
no , in holland .
at my mother and father's house .
anna , the silverware .
we can't find it .
has it been packed?
madam , this is my sister .
not now , darling .
silverware .
come , rescue me .
what's it like , university?
oh , nice .
but i don't study enough .
i much prefer singing .
i've got an accompanist at the moment .
i can play , but he's much better .
do you still play the piano?
a very nice boy .
do you want to know a secret?
we're going to get engaged .
anna , dear anna .
what would i do without you?
engaged?
really?
tell me about it .
when are you finished?
ls it the champagne , or are there more maids here?
for the jews live shamelessly in our german fatherland soldiers , comrades put the jews against the wall when the soldier goes into battle he is in high spirits with the jew's blood dripping from his knife , things look even better for we are going into battle for we are going into battle against england , england
our side has suffered the first casualty .
this is the hardest i've ever worked .
do you want to stay here?
why?
you can come with me to holland .
there is no war there .
and i'm sure my ... mother would be pleased .
go with you to holland ...
i don't have anything for you .
that many?
you don't have to read them now .
silly children's letters .
lf i had received all those letters ...
remember this?
mum's .
now you can have it for a while .
she couldn't embroider .
what are they doing?
why are they doing that?
they've gone mad .
anna , you have to leave .
you can't stay here .
come with me .
come with me to holland .
please .
why not?
i can't abandon the countess right now .
she was so kind to me .
two weeks .
three , at the most .
until we settle in there .
then i'll come .
two weeks ...
i don't understand .
i couldn't stick it here for another day .
until we've settled in .
then i'll come .
why can't you decide for yourself?
forty five rooms .
she doesn't know what to do .
it's not up to that woman .
it's your life .
three weeks .
then i'll come .
i promise .
i want to meet everybody .
your sisters .
your fianc .
want to see him?
what's the matter?
oh , nothing .
he's handsome .
what was it?
for a moment i thought he was a jew .
madam .
lf you want me to take you to the station , you'd better come now .
safe journey .
see you soon .

bye .
everyone is waiting for you .
lotte , come .
please , lotte .

i'm your sister .
i'm alive , i exist .
i didn't ask you for anything .
i've looked for you , i've telephoned .

i asked for you .
and then she doesn't know who i am .
your daughter .

anna .

anna grosalie , nothing .
anna bamberg .

how dare you?
all this time you pretended that i didn't exist .
but i'm alive .
i want to talk to you .
why are you bothering me?
you were gone .
why didn't you stay away?
why didn't you tell anyone about me?
what should i have told my children?
were you ashamed of me?
i'll walk with you and we will talk .
i don't want to talk .
then i'll talk .
i've had time .
plenty of time to think things over , lottchen .
don't call me lottchen .
let me do the talking , okay?
fine .
say what you want .
we'll walk and i'll talk .
i can't hear anything .
my god , what a pigsty .
forty five rooms .
you have to help me .
the emperor wilhelm slept here .
you can still smell him .
stuffy and sour .
i'd like to go to holland in two weeks , to visit my sister . ls that all right?
of course not .
