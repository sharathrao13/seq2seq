back in the '70s , every cop wanted out of the city .
but the only cops allowed to live outside new york were transit cops .
because the transit authority was also run byjersey and connecticut .
so these guys i knew at the 3 7 ... they started pulling overtime at subway stations ... and got the city to declare them " auxiliary transit cops .
they bought some land in jersey .
got some cheap loans from people they knew .
they made themselves a place where the shit couldn't touch 'em .
every precinct has its " cop bar , " a private club , all blue .
for the 3 7 , it was the 4 aces ... just across the river .
this armenian guy , he's from the other side over there .
he tells her that she's dead .
right?
she's gonna be dead by morning .
so he drops this box off at her place , right?
they call you guys .
they call bomb squad .
right .
we go in there .
we x ray it on scene .
and , uh , we can't see anything in there .
right .
i cut a little hole in it .
i can see there's something in there .
uh huh .
i , uh , i see that there's , uh , some white fuzz .
there's something pink .
i can't figure out what it is .
suddenly i realize i am looking at a tongue .
ah , shit !
a big , fat tongue sticking out at me .
yes .
the guy put a goat's head in there .
this at the end of the twentieth century .
h. g. wells , he'd turn over in his grave to think at the start of a new millennium ...

some armenian would be deliverin 'a goat's head to the door of the woman that he loved .

if we didn't pull over p. d. , there wouldn't be any violations in this town .
the problem in this town ain't the people that live here .

i'm gonna go get a washcloth .
okay?
all right .
you just draw a rainbow .
enough with the sparkles .
i'll be right back .
all right?
well .
i was gonna call you .
not you .
one of your guys .
why?
what's up?
oh . !
someone's been dumping garbage , garbage bags .
uh huh .
is that them?
just one of them .
the rest are mine .
i don't tell joey , 'cause then he thinks he's got to deal with it .
not that he doesn't think much of the local ... about you guys .
i'll take care of it .
it's okay .
he's got the city to worry about , right?
anyway ...
what's the point with the black garbage bag?
it's just i found your phone bill in a black garbage bag down the street .
so , what if i said i didn't know where it came from?
i'd take your word for it , rose .
is ray home?
no .
he's taking care of our little visitor .
my garbage gets picked up every tuesday .
all right .
well , thanks for your time , rose .
you telljoey that he should come and talk to me ... if he thinks i got no right .
rose , i wanna believe you when you tell me something .
did you dump these bags or not?
freddy , this isn't a law problem .
okay?
you telljoey randone if he does not like my garbage ... well , then , he should stop soiling my sheets .
you gonna tell ray about this?
hey , ray .
what's up , freddy?
decided to give me that ticket?
no .
somebody's been dumping garbage .
oh ... a felony !
what's wrong , officer?
could i see your license and registration , please?
i was just asking ...
we just came to get a view of the city .
i don't believe this .
it'll be all right .
they're just a couple over .
i'm checking docs .
i'll sit .
all right , roger that .
this ass motherfucking pig .
we came here to watch the view !
and you pull this?
speeding?
my ass !
goddamn .
do you know the meaning of the word harassment?
that's what this is , you know .
it was rose , wasn't it?
liz ... if you want me to , i'll talk to 'im .
ah , why?
you didn't marry him .
no .
but i'm your friend .
freddy , look , i gotta go .
and let me be clear .
it was the system that drove murray " superboy " babitch off that bridge .
murray babitch was a hero cop .
he deserved a fair hearing , but he knew this would not happen , not in this city .
activist cyril johns met the parents of the slain teens ... calling for a human blockade on the bridge tomorrow .
a drunk cop jumps off a bridge .
that does not erase the murder of two black children .
attending the yankee game , mayor farelli responded to reports ...
of cops attempting to plant evidence on the bridge .
shh .
shh .
we are looking into it .
there may have been some irregularity on the bridge .
but as i say ...
your mother's an irregularity .
no more comments , please .
i'm here to enjoy the ball game with my wife .
thank you .
oh , that's your boss .
are you kidding?
you'll never get another raise in your life .
who's gonna tell?
diagonal rule .
hmm?
diagonal rule .
red light , don't fight .
you make a right .
it's more important than the golden rule .
if superboy knew that , he'd still be alive , freddy .
yo . !
yo , yo .
freddy , i heard you saved ollie the turtle today .
what happened to your nose?
ah , nothing .
i just had a little accident .
listen , joey , there's something we should probably talk about if you've got some time .
what?
something we should ...
if you have a few minutes .
pretty boyjoey bettin 'against the bulls .
what is that?
what , are you some kind of high roller?
fuck you , figgs .
i had 12 points .
against the 5 time nba champs?
what kind of bet is that?
you know , you night guys ... you watch way too much oprah when you should be catching your " z's .
uh huh , figgs , well at least i'm not the one sniffin 'my money away .
that was your inner child making that wager , joey .
little boyjoey with the little met poster taped above his bed .
tell you what , figgs , why don't you do me a favor .
come on over here , unzip me , pull out my inner child and take a bite , baby .
bite it hard and bite it thick .
fuck you !
no , fuck you !
dumb fuck like that p. d. how's that make you feel , freddy?
i don't care .
yeah?
you like eatin 'doughnuts?
look , freddy .
i say it's okay to bejealous .
you saved this girl's life , right?
from it , from risking yourself from saving her sorry ass , you go deaf as a result .
in one ear .
in one ear .
then you have to watch as this girl you saved , this beauty queen ... marries this cocksucker !
and you , with your ear , you can't even get a desk on the force .
you're fucked .
be jealous , freddy !
let it out .
i would .
purge !
cleanse yourself .
fucking cleansing .
del , del , let me have another beer .
i gotta go , freddy .

he was trying to get on the force , but he had this problem with his ear .
you're not a lip reader , are ya?
no , no .
it's just this one ear when i was a kid i had this accident .
you should call me .
i mean , when ray donlan puts his thumb in the air ...
it's not the force , but i got my own people .
call me .
is he serious?
freddy , my boy , that is how things happen .
see you later .
eternal god , our father , the lord of our life and death ... we acknowledge thee in all our ways and in all events which befall us .
what's in the coffin?
his uniform .
then in thy great mercy , grant us a safe lodging and a holy rest .
and peace at last through jesus christ , our lord .
amen .
unto god's gracious mercy and protection , we commit you .
the lord bless you and keep you .
the lord make his face to shine upon you , and be gracious unto you .
the lord lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace ... both now and forevermore .
amen .
psst .
hi , sheriff .
how you doin '?
how you doin '?
this is detective carson .
how's it goin '?
come on in .
it's your office .
that there is manny cardoza and his brother .
they're drug runners .
hmph .
i didn't know they allowed classical music in jersey .
who's this?
toy torillo .
you heard of him?
oh , yes .
hmm .
i don't know how you do it , sheriff .
keeping all these hessians in line .
all blue .
everybody packing .
all together .
one door down from the next .
the wives borrowing the sugar .
it's like you're the sheriff of copland .
hmm .
look at this .
hmm .
you see , sheriff , i got a sticky problem .
myjurisdiction ends , in a sense , at the george washington bridge .
but half the men i watch live beyond that bridge ... where no one's watching .
i'm watching .
i can see that .
you've got a crime rate here of about , what?
the lowest in northern new jersey .
you got hoboken and jersey city over here .
newark .
we try to do a good job with what we have .
with a staff of three?
no , sheriff .
what you got is a town that scares the shit out of certain people .
lieutenant , i told you , i'm watching .
i mean , if you look around you see none of these people are wearing silk shirts .
their pools are above ground .
you know?
you raise your family somewhere decent , i guess that's a crime now .
lieutenant , look around .
this is a town with a population of 1, 000 people .
i got news for you .
not all cops are dirty .
i'm not saying they are .
he used to come by , have drinks with the guys .
he never caused any problems .
you mind if i sit down?
we buried a suit today .
we buried a suit today !
that doesn't bother you?
he jumped off the g. w. b. yeah , but his body never hit the water .
that doesn't bother you .
what does?
that i investigate cops?
being a man who always pined to be a cop?
i am a cop .
pined to be n. y. p. d.
three forced absent , ten years .
appeals of hearing tests .
right?
you may be law enforcement , and so am i , but you are not a cop .
now , i may watch cops .
but tell me if i'm wrong .
every day out these windows , so do you .
you watch cops too .
and since we are both law enforcement , we share a duty .
do we not?
if there is a stink , we must investigate .
we must gather evidence because evidence makes us see the truth .
is this the stink of a criminal act ... or is it a turd in a bag?
i'll tell you something , sheriff ...
i see cops who lose their way every day ... and i don't like that ... because their ambivalence is contagious .
they infect those around them .
they're like maggots ... where you find one , you find a nest ... and i take that real personally .
i went to the same academy as our friend there .
ray?
good man .
i stood by him at graduation .
he was a beauty .
he's been good to me .
yeah , a real collar man .
to the cop that he was , to his memory , i am loyal ... but through the fog of my loyalty , to the men ... the evidence makes me see and , these days , what i see ...
like an island out of my reach ...
i see this beautiful island shining through this fog ... every house financed by one of two mob banks .
that's right , sheriff .
what i see is your town .
no , no you don't see that .
babitch isn't dead .
you know that and i know that .
ray got him off that bridge alive ... before he could talk .
but he wasn't so lucky the last time when the shit hit the fan with tunney .
that boy he took care oflater .
but now what?
what does ray do now?
that's the $64, 000 question .
and that's why i'm here .
that's why i'm here , sheriff .
because you're on the inside .
and besides the church traffic , and the cats in the trees ... and all that other bullshit , okay ... there isn't much here for you to do to keep your mind busy .
but i look at you , sheriff ... and i see a man who's waiting for something to do .
and here i am .
here i am saying , " sheriff ...
i got something for you to do .
# so let's make the most of this beautiful day #
# since we're together we might as well say # d would you be mine could you be mine d d won't you be my neighbor #
you know , figgsy ... you don't have to sleep at the station if you don't want to .
you can stay in my basement until you find a new place .
let's go . !
it's gonna be a long day , poppa !
okay , your turn to be a hero .
billy heard they're having a party tonight .
# we had so many good times #
# and some bad #
# we shared the happiness # i'll take care of it , phil .
# shared the sad #
# we suffered all # hey , frank , is ray home?
what , you need us to turn it down?
no , i just need to talk to ray .
whoa , come here .
wait outside there .
i don't wanna go through this again .
it's too fucking bad .
i can't !
i told the boys ...
i mean , they're downstairs now saying good bye .
ray , how many people you got at this party?
the whole 3 7?
you got a party downstairs .
here i am scrambling , cleaning this thing up for you , and you're throwing a fuckin 'party .
the mayor's gonna suspend this case .
i'm making it happen tomorrow . !
but sooner or later , ray , they gotta find a body in that river or it will not hold .
mets , it's my sister in law's kid . !
didn't you say he was adopted?
# i'm burnin ; i'm burnin 'i'm burning for you #
turn it down . !
don't go yet .
i gotta drive donna home .
take her to the train .
ray , this doesn't make things very easy for me .
i mean ...
this is a pretty big thing you're having here the day after .
how do you think ...
freddy , what are you talking about?
this guy came to see me yesterday , this moe tilden from i. a.
he brought all these pictures and ...
freddy .
that guy's had a hard on for me for years .
it's a personal thing .
he is a scumbag .
all right .
you know how they recruit at i. a. d.?
they catch you on the take .
and they tell you you can either do time or join 'em .
well , he knows you know superboy is ...
i told him he was dead , ray .
i told him he was wrong about you , but ...
i'm the sheriff .
i mean , i'm supposed to know what's goin 'on .
how do you think this looks?
go home , freddy ... and don't think so much .
ray , i can't go .
freddy ...

i mean , i ...
i can't believe him when he tells me ... anything .
liz , you wanna come inside?
# i met a little girl and i settled down #
you can get this on cd , you know ... in stereo .
it wouldn't matter to me .
all right .
# we got married #
you know , it's a funny thing when you owe someone your life .
# then little by little #
# we drifted from each other's arms #
why is it you never got married , freddy?
# it was just restlessness #
all the best girls were taken .
# and it was somethin'more i guess #
# that tore us apart and made us weep #
# i'm drivin'a stolen car #
# down on eldridge avenue #
# each night i wait to get caught #
# but i never do #
this is crazy .
yes .
all right , take it easy .
all right?

murray?
hey , murray . !
ray's outside waitin'for ya .

the case is closed .
everybody , get the fuck outta here .

the case is fucking closed . !
with community leaders and pundits crying " cover up ,
mayor farelli's suspension of the babitch case is a big gamble ...
no one's going to read this .
it's just a bunch of red tape .
she's going to fuck up my insurance claim .
don't pull the paper out of the thing .
here's your coffee .
okay , cin , please let's try it his way .
i'm tellin 'you , you don't need to do this .
it's just a bunch of bullshit .
what do you want?
are you gonna help us or not?
help you help what?
help ray here find him?
help ray finish cleaning up his goddamn pool with the guy's head?
is that it?
huh , mr. humanitarian?
you got something you wanna say to me , ray?
or is this about something a little more personal?
i'm on at 10 : 00 .
i'm outta here .
we all are .
we got another hour .
hey , come on , joey .
instead of taking cop lessons from a cokehead ... maybe you should be lookin 'at that fire , you know?
my girl over at chase says figgs is missing a few payments .
where were you that night , jack?
i had nothin 'to do with it .
that would be retribution .
and that i leave to god almighty .
i'm gandhi .
i'm tellin'ya , the mob built this town for ray ... so they could own a fuckin 'precinct .
he's a deep and dark motherfuck .
what you're feelin 'right now , freddy ... friendless , angry , nervous , misunderstood ... this is it , this is the life .
you're lucky your ear kept you off the force .
you know ... if i saw liz ... drowning in the water ...
if i saw that today ...
i wouldn't go in .
i'd stand there , and i'd think about it .
and that's the best thing i ever did with my life .
so?
so?
so you wanna sit around your whole life wishing you were on the force?
or do you wanna bring the faggot in?
let him spill .
i wouldn't know where to begin .
all right .
brother's in deep shit .
he's down , he's bleeding , and you gotta get there .
but there's lights , right?
all over the city , red lights .
you go through the red lights .
sure , you fire up the roof , you wail , you go through the red lights , but that's slow ... fighting your way through traffic .
the goal is perpetual motion .
you want greens .
but how do you ensure the greens?
you can't .
as in life , in traffic .
so what you do is you leave yourself an out .
at every corner you leave yourself an alternative .
you move diagonal .
you turn the wheel when you hit a red light .
you don't drive down broadway to get to broadway .
if you move diagonal , you're gonna get perpetual motion .
that's what you want .
but how does this apply to what you were saying in there?
it applies , freddy !
it's just as easy to tail a man walking in front of him .
now , you butt heads with these friends of ours , you're gonna come at them head on?
okay .
they got lives , freddy .
families .
no .
you move diagonal .
you jag .
ah , christ . !
where the fuck are you guys?
we're on our way ... in 20 .
i'm down .
but , butjoey , he's tryin'to hold on ... but this big bastard , he cut me up .
stay cool , tom .
i need your location .
agh . !
he's a fucking monster . !
i need your location . !
i need an assist .
i can't move .
i think he cut my tendon .
you got a wife , huh?
huh?
you got a baby?
quit !
tell me you quit .
i'll let you go .
you go home .
kiss your wife .
eat your baby's fruit loops and shit .
you thank me , motherfucker , you're gonna be redeemed .
re re redeemed ...
officer ...
randone .
shit !
motherfucker !
shit .
it's the roof , jack .
you got units sent in .
all right , i'll check the front .
come on , come on .
son of a bitch !
agh !
agh !
please .
help . !
help . !
no !
no !
no !
no . !
in here !
joey's in trouble , ray .
ray , let's just break the fuckin'thing down .
got it .
his father is serving a life sentence for murder , murdering an ex girlfriend ...
with a sawed off shotgun back in 1988 .
the new york times is quoting one friend of royster saying ... that the guy had an i. q. of 160 .
i need your help .
they're tryin 'to kill me .
who?
who?
my friends tried to kill me .
ray donlan ... tried to kill me .
shit !
holy shit !
speak of the devil !
freddy , forget it .
i don't get this .
this doesn't make any sense .
why'd they get superboy off the bridge ... bring him back here and kill him?
ray had a plan ... and it got very fucked up .
you awake , freddy?
aw , i feel like shit .
fuckin'allergy that's killin'me .
hey .

excuse me .
i'm sorry .
moe , i apologize .
he just walked in here .
i'm sorry for rushing in like this , but you were right .
they tried to kill him like you said , but he got away .
now he's runnin 'through the woods .
he's like a scared animal .
he's scared to death .
that motherfucker should be scared .
his uncle got this case closed with one phone call .
look , i'm sorry it took so long for me to come around , but you were right .
i couldn't see the truth .
like you said , the evidence , my loyalty , they were confusing .
they never give you any napkins in this place .
what am i supposed to use?
you want this?
what is this?
you came to me , to my town ... with all these speeches , talking to me about doing the right thing .
i'm doing the right thing .
what's goin 'on?
what are you doing?
that was like two weeks ago .
two weeks ago?
what about babitch?
what about him?
fuck him .
what about donlan?
fuck him too .
what about joey randone?
he fell off a building .
don't you read the papers?
listen , sheriff , i'm really sorry ... to have awoken you from your slumber , but it's over .
hands are tied now .
you shut me down .
no , listen to me .
you're i. a. that's why i came to you .
you can do whatever you want .
remember you came to me , said , " you wanna be a cop?
i'm bein 'a cop .
i offered you a chance .
i'm asking you for some help .
i need to do something .
i need to do this for myself .
listen , you deaf fuck .
i offered you a chance .
when we could have done something , i offered you a chance to be a cop ... and you blew it !
you blew it .
you people are all the same .
that cupcake makes a mess , we got a case again .
the mob runs millions in drugs through their precinct ... and everybody gets a nice house .
figgs is right .
the mob owns this town .
they closed the case , freddy .
if they don't have ...
the stomach for it ...
they had to .
it's circumstantial .
you don't have anything either .
all that stuff is illegal .
you stole it .
i know this guy .
he's a corrections officer .
they took care oftunney when he was gonna talk .
then how come figgis didn't do somethin 'about it?
he was ray's right hand man back then .
then they tried to kill superboy .
they were hiding him , freddy .
then they burned down figgsy's house when they think he might talk .
you don't know that .
we went over every inch of that house .
not everything is a hexagonal conspiracy .
i think you been hangin 'around figgs too much .
he's the only one getting cash out of that house , and he's totally playing you ... just like those assholes in the city .
and i'm sorry , but ... there's nothing you can do about this .
yes , there is .
i can find superboy and i can bring him in .
i'm going back upstate .
i want my old job back .
i don't want any part of this .
i don't want any part of this place .
come on , cindy .
geez .
freddy , look , i don't know about ray , okay?
but everyone in garrison is not a murderer .
no .
they just keep their eyes closed and their mouths shut just like me .
## [ carnival ]
hey , freddy .
all right , thank you .
thank you .
thank you , sweetheart .
i love you too .
all right , terrific .
two in the center?
uh uh .

five out of six .
hey , freddy .
you a cop too?
yeah , yeah , i heard ya .
enjoy your trip to the big city?
you gotta hit the next five to win .
shit . !
i just hope you're not trying to prove anything , freddy .
i know some of them are real assholes .
you know .
they think they're high priests or somethin '.
i don't know .
but why would they do all this?
you know , maybe they're doin 'the right thing .
liz , i saw these pictures of ray meeting with these guys .
you know , like mobsters .
everyone's houses are financed by these mob banks .
says who?
i. a.?
even you said joey's death was no accident .
joey fell off a building , freddy !
okay?
now , i don't need this opened up .
maybe you do .
i don't .
all joey wanted was a place for us to live .
now , who are you to judge that until you've walked in his shoes?
maybe that's what you're tryin 'to do with me .
what're you gonna do , freddy?
huh?
you gonna arrest the whole town?
you goin 'to new york to take " paint by number " cop lessons?
you know , ray likes you .
that don't mean i'm gonna let you fuck him over .
ray donlan gave you this job , freddy .
you forgot that?
we made your sorry ass !
so now you can do us a favor , huh?
you could tell us ...
where superboy is .
if i knew where he was , he'd be in the city already .
you're gonna be hurtin ', freddy .
you're not gonna know when , you're not gonna know where .
you're gonna be hurtin '.
you mark my words .
i'm watchin 'you !
hey .
you got your check .
yep .
thanks to you , freddy .
filing out those forms in such a timely fashion .
hmm .
you with liz?
mm hmm .
where're ya goin '?
i don't know .
my leave came , so i thought i'd look around for a new reality .
you know?
anyway , i'm sure you could use your privacy , freddy .
no , no .
no , no .
look all you want , freddy .
you're not gonna find anything .
i took care of it .
that lady cop ... from the bomb squad got you the stuff to do this with , didn't she?
you didn't know monica was gonna be here .
did you , figgs?
no .
monica said ... she was going over to her friend's house to watch some pay per view .
the thing was on a timer .
i didn't know she was gonna be here , freddy .
it's all bullshit .
you , figgs , are the bullshit !
smarten fuckin 'up !
you even turned your back on tunney when he needed your help .
figgs !
i'm gonna find superboy , and i'm gonna bring him in .
and for once , everybody in this town's gonna tell the truth .
you gotta find him first , freddy !
i'll find him .
listen to me .
i got a check in my pocket for $200, 000 .
i got a chance to start my life again .
i don't give a shit about this town .
i don't give a shit about that town .
and i don't give a shit about your fucking justice .
bein 'right is not a bulletproof vest , freddy .
go on , figgsy !
go on . !
run away . !
hey , freddy .
ray's not home .
i know .
i'm lookin 'for your nephew .
i don't know where he is .
why the hell would i tell you if i did?
rose , i'm his only chance .
let's go .
you workin 'with the feds?
no .
i. a.?
no .
you're alone .
let's go .
oh , shit .
all right .
get down .
get down .
oh , shit .
and stay down .
bill , where are you?
bill , if you read , we're going back to the station .
you gonna keep me in here?
you gonna keep me in here with cuffs?
you don't know what you're doing do you?
shut up .
you don't have a clue as to what the fuck is going on , do you , sheriff?
bill , do you copy?
bill , do you read?
it's just club soda , freddy .
finish it .
hey , ray .
hey , freddy .
i came to tell you that i found superboy ... and i'm bringing him in tomorrow morning ... and i'd like you to come with me , i owe you that much .
he's a fugitive , and he's convinced you're tryin 'to kill him .
just tell me where he is , freddy .
you got him at the station?
ray , there's gotta be a way out of this for everyone .
so , i say why don't we all go in tomorrow together .
listen to me , freddy .
you know the difference between men and boys?
boys bet everything on everything .
boys think every hand is a royal flush .
you play cards with a man , he knows his limits .
freddy , i invited men ... cops , good men ... to live in this town .
and these men , to make a living , they cross that bridge every day ... to a place where everything is upside down .
where the cop is the perp , and the perp is the victim .
but they play by the rules .
they keep their guns in their holsters , and they play by the rules .
the only thing they did was to get their families out ... before it got to them .
we made a place where things make sense ... and you can walk across the street without fear .
and you come to me with a plan to set things right .
everyone in this city holding hands , singing " we are the world .
that's very nice .
but , freddy , your plan is the plan of a boy .
you made it on the back of a matchbook without thinking !
without looking at the cards .
i look at the cards .
i see this town ... destroyed .
now , that's not what you want , is it?
i look at this town ... and i don't like what i see anymore .
who the fuck do you think you are?
the sheriff of garrison , new jersey .
then be the sheriff !
defend this town !
protect these men !
freddy , you got him at the station?
just drop the keys .
a little too rich for my blood .
maybe they fell out of your pocket ... or maybe cindy's .
now you go home and you sleep ... and you wake up and you guide the traffic through this town ... and everything will be the way it was .
i'm taking him in tomorrow morning at 6 : 00 .
that's in a few hours .
i'd like you to come with me , ray .
there's nothing i can say?
okay , then 6 : 00 it is .
yeah .
no , lis .
who was he supposed to call?
ray knows everybody .
what am i supposed to do?
let him go in alone?
what?
you know what?
okay , fine .
why don't you go home?
i mean ...
i wanna be here for you , freddy , but ...
lisa's nervous , you know .
she's pregnant .
i mean ...
so , go on .
i'll be fine .
you be careful , freddy , huh?
yeah .
you too .
shut the fuck up !
would ya , please?
sh ...
fuck !
come on .
come on .
oh , shit !
get out , you jackass .
i said , get out , buddy .
oh , jesus .
you guys don't wanna do this .
jack .
don't shit in your pants .
he's not gonna kill ya .
this is the good one , right?
oh , god !
oh , god !
move , move , move !
all right , hit it , jackie .
