i hated that song , too .

i thought the whole point of being a kid was candy .
not anymore .
could we just have dogs?
oh , come on .
you would have been a great dad .
aw , thanks .
we tried .
it wasn't meant to be .
besides , being an uncle's better .

there you go .
your cousin bites .

that was great .
thanks .
ok ...
are you fucking serious?
that isn't what you picked?
no , no , that's what i picked .
ok .
this song is for someone who's here tonight .
if you search for tenderness
it isn't hard to find
you can have the love you need to live ...
little low .
if you look for truthfulness
you might just as well be blind
it always seems to be so hard to give
honesty
it's such a lonely word
everyone is so untrue
honesty
is hardly ever heard
it's mostly what i need from you
i can find a lover
i can find a friend
i can have security until the bitter end
anyone can comfort me with promises again
i know
i know
hey , jude?
oh , fuck off .
what?
oh , it's not that .
i've got this band .
serpentine?
oh , have you ever heard of us?
no .
anyway , rain , our singer ... she got sent to rehab .
so i was thinking ...
hey , otis !
what's up?
oh , can i borrow this?
we watched it last week , right?
yeah , but i want to listen to the commentary .
you want to?
uh , i gotta get home .
yeah , i saw your ... gil .
hey , the baby's cute .
yeah .
who would you say he looked like?
shit , i don't know .
what's the name of the pretty one?
diane .
no , no , no .
a guy , you know?
you know , if you had to say a guy he looked like .
i didn't really see him .
he's a baby , you know , cute , you know .
that's all i meant .
like , puppies and shit .
i'll see you thursday .
yeah , sure .
serpentine's playing?
ok .
see ya .
otis?
is that you?
did you leave this at my house?
does 5/ 13/ 85 mean anything to you?
if so , meet me at cahuenga grounds at 11 : 00 .
it's a little dramatic .
i'm sorry .
i'm nicky .
what is this about?
i don't want you to get the wrong impression .
i'm not a bad guy .
i'm a documentary filmmaker .
and i have a proposal for you .
strictly legitimate .
what do you know about this date?
you had a kid on that day .
somewhere in phoenix .
tell me i have that wrong .
do you want a coffee or anything?
a scone or ...
i don't i don't have any children .
well , not legally , yeah .
but , i mean , you know , he's still yours .
see hey , see?
i know it's a boy .
i know everything about him .
i know his name , i know where he lives .
he wrote , when he turned 18 , about a year ago ... for all that information that they have to give you .
that's how i got your name .
he wants to contact me?
well ... no .
but they sent him back this file , which he showed me ... and i have in a very safe place .
but he didn't want to go through with it ...
'cause he's such a suck up to his fake parents .
i hate to tell you , he's really kind of a pussy .
who are you?
i'm a friend .
i'm like a mentor ... guy .
he went to my high school six years after me .
do you want to find him?
because i can tell you how ... on one condition ... which is ... you let me film the whole thing you finding your kid .
see , i need to get into afl .
do you know afl?
afi is american film institute .
so , they have scholarships .
well , they have , like , one scholarship a year ... so i need a killer film .
a documentary , like you finding your kid .
i don't believe this .
ok , yeah .
we'd have to fake parts of it .
sure , we would .
but the emotion would be true .
your guilt and stuff ... that would be our selling point .
i am so glad that you're not a dog .
i mean , you know , even if the story is great ... people want to look at good looking people .
you know , all things being equal .
so , huge relief when i saw you , you know?
and i can make you look better .
that's lighting .
i don't need to see my son .
i was going to have an abortion , in fact ... until someone talked me out it .
if you don't care , then why'd you keep updating the adoption agency ... with your addresses?
there's four of them in the file .
he has the information .
he can contact me if he wants to .
he won't .
he threw it away .
the whole file .
that's how i got it .
if it wasn't for me , you'd go to your grave without ever seeing him .
you can keep that .
i have the original .
i needed to reshoot finding it for the movie .
there's other stuff , too .
there's other stuff like this that i can
anyway , just ... say yes .
i mean , it's win win here .
this is a human being you're talking about .
yeah !
who you gave away , ok?
i mean , come on , don't don't be like that .
look , i know that this is one of those big ideas ... but it's really just better if you just say yes to the movie ... because otherwise , i have to charge you 25k just for the info .
that's what they want at afi for a year .
ok , you tell me where my son is or i'm going to the police .
in fact , no , i'm going to go to the police anyway ... you miserable jackass !
and i'm gonna press every charge they come up with .
how's that for a big idea?
fuck .
fuck !
god damn it !
you know ... what i didn't figure is that you wouldn't care .
which you don't .
you haven't even asked me his first name .
i was gonna throw you that bone .
but you know what?
fuck you !
no , no , no , you can tell me his first name .
no , you blew it .
wow , you look ... different .
well , yeah , it was a long time ago , ok?
what'd you look like back then?
i don't forget it .
listen , do you know who the father is?
because if you say no , maybe this guy will go to him .
no .
father unknown .
i mean , of course , i know who the father was ... but that's what i put down on the forms .
and the father's dead .
plane crash .
and you don't have 25, 000?
no , i can barely pay the first and second on the house !
how can i
what about your family?
no , none of them know about the baby .
except my dad .
he's dead , too .
you know a lot of dead people .
well , it happens .
it's creepy .
i'm young , and i don't even care
how lucky am i?
i'm young , with a few bucks to spare
and i don't even try
i know it's all in my mind
how lucky am i?
how lucky am i?
ok , that was awesome !
you sounded just like rain , and she was good .
really?
'cause her tape sucks .
can you slur and then have your forehead hit the mike?
that was , like , her signature .
hey , miles , let's get this in the van for tomorrow .
god , i don't know what to do with this song !
we could slow it down maybe .
go slow?
hey , do you guys mind if i ask you something?
she's not in rehab for drugs .
it's just booze .
plus , she's a vomiter .
a fat vomiter , which is fucking useless .
no ... just , why is otis the leader?
i could drum better than him and his backup vocals suck .
look around .
yeah , he's an untalented little faggot ... but he's a rich , untalented little faggot .
his dad owns linux hills mall .
or , like , most of it .
and he knows every club owner in town .
you think we could buy this stuff on our own?
he's like bill gates .
that makes sense .
for now .
until pappy finds out ... his kid's a pickle smoker , then we're history .
he's already got his suspicions .
he's gay?
total cocksmooch .
he'll deny it , but ...
he's not gay .
he just he looks gay .
dude , you won't even take a piss with him .
hey , there's beer , too , guys .
why do you think he's a drummer?
so he can stare at our asses all night .
that's him .
sure?
ok , yeah .
hurry .
hurry .
here .
oh , god .
ok .
not a good wiper .
what kind of movies does this guy make?
i don't know .
he's an idiot .
the kind idiots make , i guess .
all right , we're looking for a file , ok?
don't mess anything up , if you can .
not that he'd notice .
yeah , check the duffel bag .
what if it's in his car?
javi .
ok .
this is
this is the form i signed .
i left this with them , to go with the baby .
who's miriam?
me .
is there anything else , anywhere?
did you see a file?
there's no name .
mamie , we'd better go .
hey , wait , wait , wait .
is that sentimental?
not really .
let's trade .
he'll never know the difference .
thank you .
whoa !
what the fuck is this?
no , no !
what are you doing here?
it's ok .
i followed you today .
it's ok .
you think you're gonna beat it out of me?
i can't believe you !
my god , nicky , no .
it's nothing like that , no .
what's he doing here , then?
he's your new documentary .
ok?
javier , this is nicky ... the director i was telling you about .
he's an immigrant , ok?
from mexico .
and ... he was in gangs .
they had gangs there , all right?
and he crossed the border ... so that he could put his life back together in the states .
it's the american dream .
ok?
it's good .
is that it?
that sucks !
you think that's as good ... as a mother finding the kid she ditched?
all right , well , if you're not interested in that
no , i'm not interested , ok?
we're done .
i can get into afi some other way .
i can shoot ... me getting into afl .
that'd be a good
just get the fuck out of here .
all right , all right , we'll go .
so but we'll work out another deal .
no , you've got nothing to offer .
i got nothing to sell .
it's cool , man , ok?
we get it .
ok?
we couldn't think of anything better , but you're right .
who wants to see a movie about a sex worker?
what?
a sex worker .
that's what i do .
massage , the works , you know?
for these rich beverly hills ladies?
but you know what?
sex
no , sex shouldn't be in a serious movie .
come on , mamie .
no , whoa , whoa .
if it's ... necessary to the story , then ...
what are we doing?
now we're helping him?
you want to know where your son is , right?
how hard could it be?
we do a couple interviews ... we put it all on the computer .
right?
the tapes , everything?
he gives us the name , and we give him the movie .
yeah .
well , you heard him , though .
he wants to shoot you doing the sex stuff .
so we fake it .
it'll be pretend .
you can be there to see .
look , you're the boss .
i'm just the star .
have you done that?
that kind of massage?
happy ending?
the full release?
yeah .
one time .
with you last week .
nah .
that was just a goof .
so is this .
but at the end of it , you're going to know who your son is .
happy endings .
you know , that'd be a good title for his movie .
you should tell him that .
it could be your idea .
oh , well .
it's late .
the lady from mexico said i could take some of this home .
she went to bed .
guatemala .
really?
she didn't tell me her name .
my cousin is charging me rent , and she's got all her food labeled .
she said it's so that her boyfriend has what he wants when he comes home .
oh , shit !
there were subs left?
do you mind?
aw , yes !
yeah , the thing is , you need a day job .
we just get meals sometimes .
couple bucks .
i told you that .
you always been rich?
i'm not rich .
it's all relative .
that's what rich people always say .
give me a tour .
oh , shit .
just a real quick one .
is this the african room?
no , those are those are from indonesia .
come on , tour me .
my dad's college roommate's .
he's taking off his pants .
i know .
these are some sculpturey things .
where did
hey , don't !
it's freezing outside .
your pool is so warm !
i know .
oh , nice .
i just got this .
we're on this website for new bands .
what are you doing?
i gotta spend the night , ok?
i just need a break .
i'm a little buzzed .
i don't know .
i
oh , just friends .
come on .
you're cute , but i don't know .
have you ever slept with a girl before?
ok , duh , i'm 22 .
i can drive you home .
look ...
i really want to spend the night .
i figure you should get something out of it , too .
but i've got a girlfriend .
otis , come on .
you should try it .
you might not be who you think you are .
you can leave your watch on .
oh , i don't have a condom .
have you ever had sex with anybody before?
not exactly .
so you don't need one .
here .
ok .
i'm sorry .
i'm a little distracted .
oh , the tits .
right?
here .
is that better?
yeah .
good morning , mr. frank .
hey .
let me get this .
no , i got it , i got it .
their band played here .
all right .
oh , hello .
are you the dad?
what?
are you the dad?
yeah .
i'm frank .
i'm jude .
i'm with otis .
ok .
see ya .
yeah .
your dad's home .
oh , shit !
he's early .
you totally owe me , dude .
he does not think you're a 'mo anymore .
hey , i am not gay .
hello?
you hello .
hey , otis .
hey .
nice girl .
yeah , she's in the band now .
ok .
listen ... don't make dignora wash the sheets , ok?
she's like your mother .
ok , gil .
i have something to tell you .
but before i do , you have to promise me ... that i'm the boss of this , ok?
what?
ok , i've discovered something , which i don't have to tell you ... so the fact that i'm doing that ... means you have to hand it over to me ... which means that what i say goes , ok?
no .
fine .
up to you .
absolutely fine .
it's cool .
come on , please?
it's really good .
this is really great .
you'll thank me .
if you want to tell me , tell me .
ok .
you promise i'm the boss?
how old are you?
look , only i cared to put this thing together .
i think that gives me a little ownership .
i'm not crazy here .
i mean , this is really , really good .
ok , you're the boss , i agree .
in all things pertaining to this extraordinary development ...
i will be guided by you , is that ok?
" guided " meaning?
charley !
ok .
max is your kid .
your biological descendant .
your spawn .
what're you talking about?
ok , this has been bugging me for months ... but now i'm so sure .
3 1/ 2 years ago , you donated sperm to their gyno .
yes .
after three months of trying , pam said it wasn't working ... and they were gonna get a donor from a sperm bank .
yes .
they were upset about it , remember?
pam was a wreck .
fact : six months later , they're pregnant .
sperm can be kept viable for up to twelve years ... if frozen correctly , according to this website i found .
when your parents came to visit a year ago ...
pam , max , and diane all got sick ... and couldn't come over to visit because your mother ... would recognize max as her grandchild .
and , finally ...
you ... max .
all kids look alike !
no , no , no .
no , you see it .
you see it , but you can't believe it .
i can't believe it because
come on , it doesn't make sense .
why would they lie?
because this way , max is all theirs .
they don't have to consult you about anything .
sure , they'd lose a little money ... but it's the power , that's what they want .
they don't have to consider us at all .
but if that's how they feel about it ... why did they even try with us in the first place?
i don't know .
sentiment .
but then they thought better of it .
maybe we were too enthusiastic .
maybe we got excited and started talking about colleges ... or said something nice about sugar .
ok , then , you know , they changed their mind .
why not really use sperm from a sperm bank?
because you're a sure thing .
look at you .
you're smart , you're sexy .
you're not faggy at all .
the gayest thing about you is me .
i've known pam since the eighth grade .
she wouldn't lie .
she's a mother .
it's a sick , sick bond .
think of yours .
think of mine .
it's unwholesome .
we have to call them .
no , no , they'll just deny it .
look , we have options .
we have plenty of options .
i think you should just let it sink in .
god !
i'm the boss of this , remember?
you're too emotional .
just ... trust me .
did you guys hear that thing on npr this morning?
about sperm .
oh , no , no , no , i didn't hear that one .
well , maybe it was yesterday .
what was that?
just about storage and freezing and stuff .
pam , those jeans are great .
were those the ones
where did we get those?
on melrose?
those are the ones you picked out , the french ones .
they're so good .
thanks .
do you guys know how long sperm keeps?
no .
do tell .
twelve years .
what?
yeah .
in the proper , you know , facility .
i don't know what it would be at home .
did you hear the other story , though?
it must have been after that , on the khmer rouge ... about that guy who was growing vegetables behind the torture room?
no .
that was devastating .
i almost had to pull the car over .
was max in the car?
yeah , but he was sleeping .
sugar , bad .
torture , fine .
is that big enough , right here?
that's great , that's perfect for me .
can i get some ice cream with that?
oh , absolutely .
i'll get it .
you know , there's tofutti in there , too .
oh , good .
you should try it .
what are you still doing here?
go play dominoes .
get me some scissors from the bathroom .
what?
we can take a dna sample from his hair ... but i can't pluck any without waking him .
what are you , crazy?
just get away from him .
oh , my god , my car keys , i forgot this .
you're not doing it .
just give me those .
yeah !
come on , this is gonna work .
charley !
listen , i know what those tests cost .
no , charley .
look at him , he's so cute when he's sleeping .
yeah .
how can you not believe this?
look at him !
there's a photograph of you at home looking just like this .
stick him in tinkerbell pj's , it's the spitting image .
what is the matter with you?
jesus !
we are going to drop this , ok?
look at him .
he's happy , they're happy , we're happy .
just leave it alone , all right?
yeah , but you believe me now .
no !
yeah .
i don't .
promise me , all right?
i don't care if you're positive about this .
just leave it alone .
i'm serious .
ok .
fine .
i'm not leaving here until you're back in that living room .
go .
aw , man !
this is awesome !
i'm so going to buy this from you when we're done .
no , forget it , ok?
it's all going back to the store ... before the credit card bill comes , ok?
so don't drop it .
that's not funny .
don't you know any of this stuff?
oh , wow , you look really pretty if i stand far away and i use the zoom .
thank you .
ok , it's back to normal now .
ok .
cool .
all right , here , gimme the camera .
ok , here , sure .
ok , but right now .
thank you .
all right , let's see .
just have to open the program .
here it comes .
there it is !
who's that handsome guy , huh?
cool !
make it rewind through the computer .
ok , no !
not in my room !
all right?
it's this room , the bathroom , the kitchen .
everything else is off limits .
there .
you're sleeping with javier .
you could've told me .
this is my boyfriend .
he's a sex worker .
you're embarrassed , huh?
no , it's none of your business .
and it doesn't affect any of this , does it?
wait , wait , wait , rewind , rewind , rewind .
hey , who's that guy?
oh , my ex husband .
still hung up on him?
no .
that's there to remind me what he's like when he calls .
he lost $62, 000 that night .
that could've been my money !
yeah , that's what really hurts about it .
does javier gamble?
i don't know .
i don't care .
i'm not planning to marry him .
yeah , duh !
he's creepy .
senor fingers !
i don't want him handing me any cigarettes ... if you know what i mean .
so , you're just into him for the sex .
'cause , i mean , i get that , you know .
he's dangerous .
he's , like ... gangs and handjobs and mexican .
i can see where that'd be attractive ... but , you know , you've married the bad boy before .
mr. vegas , huh?
live and learn .
naturally , as my extortionist ... your insights are particularly valuable .
then why is he holding back , though?
i mean , bring on the ring , dude !
like , he should marry you .
he should totally marry you .
you're a step up .
ok .
well , this is in .
it's in the hard drive .
when we're done with this , we can edit .
watch .
don't .
no , don't .
oh , come on !
that's not a zoom , incidentally .
just the way it is .
like a penis , only bigger .
who raised you?
how lucky am i?
i'm yours , and i don't even care
how lucky am i?
i'm young
with a few bucks to spare
and i don't even try
i know it's all in my mind
how lucky am i?
i can't believe all my good fortune
i count my blessings every day
should hurt to be so fun loving
my life must be a crime
how lucky am i?
he says , " i can't take 67 more of those !
how's the food?
thanks , mr. mckee .
it's great .
yeah , we were just going to hit up taco bell .
well , it's my pleasure .
you guys are good .
how's the new amp?
makes a difference , yeah .
you are really , really talented .
thank you .
i'm just trying to hang in there .
what do you mean?
she's just helping us out until rain gets out .
yeah , i need to get a real job , anyway .
i got evicted earlier this month .
actually , the guy that i was subletting with got evicted ... and none of my checks made it to the landlady ... so that was fun .
speaking of that , we should probably get you back to your cousin's .
wait .
you're not sleeping on someone's couch?
it's an air bed .
you just push the button , boom , it's full sized .
otis , what is the matter with you , dude?
dude?
listen , we got an empty pool house .
you move in there till you find a place .
oh , i don't know .
we practice there , dad .
that's what i'm saying .
it's no use to me .
it's got a big bedroom and a full bathroom .
you'll love it .
well , i don't know .
i do .
it's fine .
miles , you'll know this .
what would it take to get all you cats into a studio to cut a cd?
seriously?
seriously .
nice car .
well , my dad's letting me run out the lease .
isn't it nice not being a fag?
this is the thing ...
i'll totally help you find a new place .
because this is temporary .
that's what he said , until you find your own place .
oh , what's it to you?
what do you mean?
this is too fast .
we're sleeping together .
yeah , once .
it wasn't that fast .
it was good .
i'm just saying we've got to be our own , independent people .
suddenly , we're , like , living together?
you know what?
it's fine .
'cause we're breaking up .
what?
look , i'm not going to screw you and your dad .
you're not going to fuck my dad .
he is 44 , ok?
so , the first guy i slept with was 38 and i was 13 .
my best friend's dad .
you're making that up .
that's from american beauty .
it was exactly like that .
except i didn't have roses coming out of my tits .
my dad has lots of girlfriends , and he spends money on them ... but he doesn't marry them , so you can forget that .
why would i want to marry him?
like that's what i need a gay stepson .
you think i'm just going to let someone take advantage of my father?
hey , butt boy , listen ... if you don't help me with this ...
i'm going to tell him you're gay ... and then you'll be out on your ass , not me , ok?
so ...
first thing you gotta do is , you gotta break up with me ... because there's no way your dad's gonna fuck his son's first real girlfriend .
he's got morals .
yeah , well , i am dumping you , ok?
just so you know .
yeah .
but let me tell you why .
breakfast?
no , thanks .
thought you were out in the pool house .
why?
otis , it's ok if you want to spend the night with jude .
it's fine .
you're not a teenager anymore .
she get settled in all right?
she's moving out .
what?
we broke up .
i mean , i broke up with her .
she's moving back to her cousin's ... and she might not even be in the band anymore .
i don't know .
what happened?
she lied to me about her age .
she's not 24 , she's 29 .
she's too old .
she's 29?
yeah , for another month .
i don't want to date a 30 year old .
i'm 22 .
you know?
i could be in college .
why would she lie about her age?
i just assumed .
i don't know .
anyway , she ... she wants to use the pool today .
i said it was ok .
her cousin's at work , and she gave back her key .
well , i'm sorry things turned out this way .
i'm going over to alvin's .
in the lexus .
sure , sure .
sure , whatever .
hey .
oh , hey , mr. mckee .
no , frank .
listen ...
i hear things are a little tricky .
yeah .
thanks for the pool house thing and all .
i don't think it's going to work out .
you know , i'd really hate to see you leave the band .
they really need you .
well , it's kind of up to otis .
i could talk to him .
i mean , every woman lies about her age a little bit .
that's what he told you it was about?
man , it's not that .
he's got someone else .
lane .
lane?
that's a girl's name?
he didn't tell you anything about her?
you don't know your son very well , do you?
well , i don't think you should leave .
i insist you stay .
i'm going to talk to otis ...
'cause that's no way to treat somebody you care about .
i wish he was more like you .
well , he's young , and maybe i could have done a better job .
but i was a kid when i had him , practically .
do you know what?
you remind me of the first boy i dated .
hardly a boy .
now you're lying .
oh , my god .
oh , my god .
yeah , that's why i've been behaving so weird lately .
you know .
we both have .
i just i i can't even believe this .
i can't believe we're having this conversation .
all right .
so ... what kind of disease?
he won't say , you know?
he
it's neurological , he told me that .
oh , my god .
yeah .
hereditary .
all the males in his family have to be tested for it .
do you i mean , what's the name of it?
it's not ms , i know that .
well , is it like ms?
well , it's ... i don't know .
are you forgetting the name of it?
he didn't want me to interfere , you know?
he just thought i would be , you know ... that i would be on the internet ... and i'd be talking to doctors and nagging him .
like i'm that guy , you know .
i'm not that guy .
all right .
what are the symptoms?
do you know the symptoms?
yeah .
did you know gil's grandfather ... when you were at high school together?
no .
i don't think so .
i don't i don't even remember gil talking about him or mentioning him .
well , i'm not surprised .
it's pretty debilitating .
oh , my god .
oh , my god !
hey , it's not fatal .
it's ok .
it's not?
no , no , no .
it's just untreatable .
yeah .
all right .
so , when i mean , what do we do?
pam , you mustn't say that we you can't tell him we spoke .
oh , god .
all right .
i mean , i yeah .
he would kill me if he knew we'd spoken .
oh , my god .
max !
max?
i've got to go pick him up .
i gotta get myself together .
that's the one comfort we have .
what?
you know , that you guys couldn't get pregnant ... with gil's , you know .
like your body knew somehow .
just said ... not allowed .
i gotta go .
i gotta go .
sorry .
hey , pam , i think it's going to be ok .
i gotta say , man , i'm glad she's not here for first day ...
'cause she's , like , opinionated .
all right .
what did you do to your face , man?
what do you mean?
you got a fake moustache on .
oh , yeah .
you like it?
it's so my clients don't notice me , you know?
it's a little make up , too , that mamie has .
mamie's white , ok?
you look like a scared mexican .
like , down at the border on the news .
hey , come on .
that's my face up there , ok?
it's gonna look good through the camera .
just shoot .
it's cool , man .
i don't know how it's gonna read .
i guess
come on .
i gotta go .
well , it looks all right .
ok .
we're rolling , we're rolling .
came up with a list of questions that , you know ... everybody who's ever gotten a massage , i'm sure , wants to know .
have you had a massage , ever?
yeah , i have .
actually , let's start with that .
what do you do when somebody lets one out ... while you're massaging them?
do you just keep going?
is that what the incense is for?
take me through that .
you farted today inside .
no .
you said it was her !
cut !
you know something?
women don't fart like that , my friend .
do me a favor?
take a picture of me .
i forgot , i wanted to do it before .
so we'll get back to this .
ready?
your fly's open .
good .
here we go .
what's it like ... when some woman you're massaging lets one out?
ok , they're cooked all the way now .
i didn't know .
i like 'em pink .
ok .
maybe we have five minutes , in a montage ... with music covering the stupidity .
we shot for two hours .
yeah , and it's garbage .
nicky , who cares who invented that donut that people put their face in?
it's called a cradle , ok?
a face cradle , and i think it's interesting .
and farts?
and who pays for the lotion?
and , so , ok , how do people tip you?
because they're naked , so where's the wallet?
that's neat , ok?
the little envelopes at the front desk?
i didn't know that .
all right .
do you want to get into film school?
yeah .
because i don't care .
i just have to help you make a documentary .
as good as the one you're not letting me make .
no .
no .
just a documentary .
if you want a stupid interview ... that you could see on the local news , fine .
but if you want this to be good ... if you want people to care about him ... you have to have a point of view .
i have a point of view !
this guy has it made , and i care ... because i want to see him get all these ladies off .
that's your reasoning?
yes !
oh , ok .
all right .
well , i'm relieved .
what does that mean?
it means someone smart would be harder to please .
but if you're stupid , hey , just makes my job easier .
what did you just call me?
forget it .
it's ok .
you know , you say " stupid " too much .
i just mean , i think you're better than this ... or you could be .
yeah , well i think that goes for everybody ... from what i can see from right here .
anyway , the makeup blows .
i'll give you that .
it's no fun thinking of him nailing all these women ... if he might be a homo , but that's just me .
that's my beer .
sorry .
it's ok .
ok .
all right .
it's gonna be ok .
all right , well , it's gonna be good .
we'll just go through it again .
i got two hours of footage .
yeah .
will you do me a favor , for my sanity?
will you just say to me
please just say to me right now ... five minutes was an overestimation .
jesus christ .
time to go .
hey , charley .
that was pam and diane from the car .
they're on their way over .
i thought we were seeing them tonight at jill's .
they say they have something to tell us .
wow .
that was fast .
you know , don't you?
all right , guys .
i don't know where to begin .
oh , well ...
so ...
look , you know , these things , they just get out of hand .
i mean , you know , you want to tell ... you want to get it off your chest .
and i'm sure every night you think you will ... and it just gets harder and harder .
