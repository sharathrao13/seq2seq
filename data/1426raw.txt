can i help you?

who iet you through?
your men .
commissioner pierre niemans .
just you?
paris said they'd send a unit .
what the heil?
i'm the unit .
captain ... ... i didn't drive aii night to wage war with cops .
what's the iow down?
foilow me .
two days ago , the coilege dean reported remy cailois missing .
thirty two years old , single .
remy iectured at the coilege .
he was also the iibrarian .
an upper echelon job there .
according to the dean , remy was punctuai and hardworking .
he never showed up iate .
yesterday afternoon ... ... a young mountain climber found his body .
why caii in the homicide squad?
we're not used to this kind of stuff .
why?
his body was strung up there .
at 50 meters .
guernon university , 500 meters
you're from the homicide unit , but not reaily , is that it?
that's it .
we never dealt with you before .
you're iucky .
happy is he who penetrates the hldden causes of thlngs
what's this coilege doing here?
it's no ordinary coilege .
it provides its own electricity , its own water .
it even has a hospital .
1, 200 students .
100 professors and researchers .
one of europe's oldest universities .
in case of a snowstorm , it can survive for a month .
the dean is iike the mayor of the vailey .
he runs most of the region .
here's where they form future biii gates .
future what?
future biii gates .
the hospital's attached to the coilege?
it's open to everyone in the region .
we aii get free health care .
we work a iot with them .
there's even a maternity wing .
this is commissioner niemans .
he'ii be helping out on this case .
i was in your criminology class in 1987 .
did you start yet?
i haven't cut the cord .
can we see?
i figured you'd want to see him intact .
it's incredible .
the work of a reai madman .
he strove for the foetai position .
what position?
the foetal .
like a foetus in its mother's beily .
he's been dead for 48 hours .
examination reveals traces of incisions ... ... on the shoulders , arms , elbows and thighs ... ... made by a sharp instrument .
a carpet cutter .
can you cut the cord?
four broken ribs .
arms broken at the shoulders and elbows .
multiple fractures : tibia , hip ....
i'ii put it aii in a detailed report .
the hands were amputated before he died , with an axe ... ... the stumps cauterised to avoid his bleeding to death .
the kiiler obviously wanted to keep his victim alive .
i wouldn't do that ....
he carved out the eyes iike a surgeon .
operating on a iive patient .
what the fuck is this shit?
the sockets were fiiled with rain .
it's being analysed .
there's a good eye doctor in guernon .
he may shed some iight on this .
how iong did it take him to die?
i'd have to cut him open , but i'd say five hours .
the size and precision of the wounds ... ... indicate that he wanted his victim conscious ... ... but in the greatest possible state of pain .
check every prison , every ioony bin and sect .
every trail , refuge and ski slope .
run random identity checks on drivers in a 160 kilometre radius .
dig up evidence of similar mutilations in the past 20 years .
talk to possible witnesses and cailois's coileagues .
anyone who knew his itinerary .
find out where it rained in the past two days .
find anything : witnesses , clues ....
you have two hours .
doctor cherneze ophthalmologlst
who's there?
who's there?
who is it?
why won't you talk?
doctor !
who are you?
what's going on?
get the dog out of here .
it's nothing .
go home .
everything's aii right .
see you on tuesday .
who are you?
commissioner niemans .
sorry , dogs scare me shitless .
dogs are not to fear .
just their masters .
how can i help you?
i'm investigating remy cailois's death .
i heard about it .
how awful .
did you know him?
i knew his father .
we went to coilege together .
did you teach at the coilege?
for 20 years .
but i stopped teaching in 1982 .
why?
difference of opinion .
with the dean?
i don't understand .
what's the iink between me and remy?
i have some pictures i'd iike your opinion of .
he was tortured?
for severai hours .
how horrible ....
i didn't know .
no hands?
nor eyes .
that's why i'm here .
to understand these mutilations .
how would i know?
what exactly do you treat?
genetic afflictions concerning the eyes .
hereditary diseases transmitted from one generation to the next .
they strike isolated areas and with the coilege ....
what about the coilege?
teachers have been marrying among themselves for ages .
the bloodlines are weak , worn out .
genetic problems keep popping up .
the ransom of the elite .
i thought the professors 'kids were prodigies .
they are .
i don't get it .
over the past two generations ... ... the situation has reversed .
the native mountain children are getting sick .
like the boy you just saw .
could there be a connection between the mutilations and the diseases?
hands and eyes are the body parts that belong to us alone .
they're different from anyone else's , iike with dna .
they're our biologicai identity .
your kiiler is giving you hints as to his motive .
and he starts stabbing away .
he stabs the dog , stabs the guy ... ... grabs the bag and throws the knife under the car !
seriously , paris is fuii of psychos !
the subway !
the cops !
robocops !
hand over your ticket , please !
what the heil?

what's she missing?
nothing's missing .
that's what's so strange .
i've never seen you .

is it that obvious?
what did you do to end up here?
cops are iike teachers .
we can't always choose our school .
teii me about it !
for 14 years , i've asked to be transferred !
now it's too iate .
they broke in here , where we keep schooi records .
they went about it extremely carefuily .

it's your iucky day .
they caii me " gravedigger " .
over the past 27 years , i've seen 248 , no , wait ... ... 249 accidents entailing deaths .
on our part of the highway alone .
30 kilometres !
cops and firemen get aii the attention .
but we're the first guys on the scene .
it's aii in here .
what do you want to know?
you can use that?
what do you think?
i'm iooking for the parents of a giri kiiled in '82 .
judith herault .

judith herault ...
h e r a u l t.
search by victim's name judith herault

god knows what happened .

unlverslty of guernon
the dean's office?
that way , on your ieft .
i want to see the dean .
i'm his assistant .
how can i help?
by getting me the dean , now .
who shaii i say is here?
commissioner niemans .
commissioner niemans for you .
have a seat .
i'ii just be a minute .
i'm a slave to this university .
i never have enough time .
what can i do?
i'm investigating cailois's death .
i spoke to captain dahmane .
teii me about remy's private iife .
do you work with dahmane?
neither with nor without .
i iead a speciai unit .
it's you .
i don't understand what happened .
remy never posed the slightest problem .
he was kind , hardworking .
his parents were close friends .
he took over his father's job in the iibrary .
he went to schooi here?
like most of us .
many students are born and grow up here .
some become professors iike their parents .
it's sort of the tradition .
it was the case with remy .
he didn't have a police record .
maybe there's something we missed , that may be of help .
like what?
someone who hated him .
drug use , some religious conviction ....
i think you misunderstood me .
this university is a community , a temple of knowledge .
everyone iives and works here in perfect harmony .
to accuse one of us is to accuse aii of us , including me .
i want to visit his apartment .
i'm afraid that's impossible .
the police sealed it off .
i'd iike to see it aii the same .
hubert , come here , please .
unfortunately , i can't join you .
i hope you don't mind if my son shows you the way .
as i told you , traditions are a way of iife here .
we've been voted " best coilege " three years in a row .
we even helped raise the nationai average .
just for fun , we calculated the average iq here .
guess how much .
twenty four .
excuse me?
cailois had room 24 .
do you have the key?
no .
do you have permission to go in?
what did he do at the iibrary?
he was in charge of books and seating arrangements .
seating arrangements?
our tradition is to be seated in the same place every year .
it's beneficiai and makes seating easier .
dominissimus .
simus serve .
ubicum que ....
we are the masters .
we are the slaves .
we are everywhere .
we are nowhere .
we controi the crimson rivers .
it was his ph. d. thesis .
he'd been working on it for years .
fanny ferreira?
up there .
i've got to go .
see you tomorrow .
fanny ferreira?
you discovered remy cailois's corpse?
who are you?
pierre niemans .
i came from paris to investigate .
paris exports cops now?
depends on the case .
too bad .
i iike the iocai yokels .
their seriousness cracks me up .
me , too .
you can make a difference?
i've been trying to for 25 years .
maybe you can help .
i doubt it .
i didn't see much .
i scaled the cliff twice before noticing him .
didn't you read my statement?
did ....
did the kiiler have to be strong to get the body up there?
not necessarily .
with know how and good equipment , you can iift anything , anywhere .
what was he iike?
a pretentious asshole .
like most students here .
i agree .
it seems pretty ....
uptight?
exactly .
a closed circuit race course for high performance cars .
if you've been around once ....
i read that you're a glaciologist .
what do you do?
i controi avalanches .
the school's in a vailey , so i try to steer them away .
you protect the school .
i do my job .
like remy cailois .
what?
you went to , and work for the school , iike remy cailois .
so?
you're part of the clan .
what clan?
the elite composed of professors 'kids .
i have a busy day and i don't iike uniforms .
your coileagues have my number .
it's the pathologist .
i got the results of the water in his eyes .
it's rain water .
acid rain .
what?
it's pretty common .
but we haven't had any acid rain since the 1970s .
and it hasn't rained recently .
i don't get it .
it's ice cold .
freezing .
heilo , sister .
i'm a police officer .
does a certain mrs. herault reside here?
may i ask why?
i'm sorry .
i'm afraid not .
i can't say .
sister andre has been here for 17 years .
this concerns a relatively old incident .
could i possibly see her?
i'ii see .
come in .
wait here .
take off your cap ....
where do you think you are?
my son !
wait here .
sister andre wiii see you .
but i should warn you ....
about what?
you can speak to her , but you cannot see her .
you can iisten , but you cannot go near .
why not?
the shadows , my son .
what about the shadows?
sister andre took the vow of the shadows .
we haven't seen her for 15 years .
sister ....
sister andre?
sister?
i'm a police officer from sarzac , just nearby .
your daughter is buried there , right?
judith was your daughter , wasn't she?
i'm here because iast night someone tried to open her tomb .
they're coming back .
who?
they're coming back to complete their mission .
who are you talking about?
the demons .
they want to make sure judith won't cause them any more trouble .
so it's these demons who kiiled your daughter?
could you try being a iittle more explicit?
for 18 years i've been trying to forget .
last night ... ... your demons ... ... broke into the schooi and stole judith's class picture .
i need your help to understand why .
in order to erase every trace of my child .
what for?
to protect their secret .
what secret?
judith's face is a threat to them .
please , sister .
i'm sorry , but ....
can you teii me the circumstances of your daughter's death?
my daughter feii iil .
we went to the hospitai she was born in .
then the demons attacked us .
they chased us .
i wanted to run away , to disappear with my daughter .
but they found us .
no one can escape their clutches .
where did you iive before sarzac?
the nightmare began in guernon .
did you try cailing the police for help?
i speak of demons ... ... and you speak of police .
there's nothing you can do for my child .
save your soui while you stiii can .
leave me now .
i want to stop remembering .
forgive me .
glaciers are formed from years of compacted snow .
the snow is compressed into ice .
each season has a corresponding stratum .
this glacier is 200 metres deep .
it's a huge source of water and energy .
the water composing it dates back centuries .
what's the point of studying glaciers?
the college power plant has a research lab .
this glacier is sliding .
we study the risk factor it represents .
here .
how far down do we have to go?
at ieast 30 metres .
why did you choose me?
there are great guides in the area .
they say you're the best .
and you were available .
you enlist civilians to find murderers?
let's say i'm picking you up .
put this on .
don't step on the rope .
welcome to the time machine , commissioner .
i'ii compare this ice to the acid rain you had analysed .
we're at the right depth .
he must have brought us here for a reason .
there must be a clue ....
a trace .
niemans , that's dangerous !
we can't stay here .
water can come gushing in at any second .
what's back there?
naturai water canals .
what are you doing?
where are you going?
where are we?
an intra glaciai canal ... ... dug out by the water that feeds the power plant .
we can't stay here .
it's dangerous .
let's go .
what's wrong?
the light brigade !
what'ii it be , guys?

the chief wants to see your tenants .
in the back .

into the vault of judith herault , who died in 1982 .
he couldn't open the coffin , so he tried misleading us with swastikas .
that night , someone broke into the elementary school ... ... and stole pictures and documents from '81 and '82 ... ... the two years judith herault attended that school .
she's one of these kids .
how did she die?
run over by a truck .
they cailed it an accident .
but the mother told me something completely different .
according to her ... ... her daughter was kiiled by demons .
demons ....
she has a major screw ioose .
she's in a convent since .
but i got the impression she wasn't teiling me ail ....
did you griii her or have tea?
i was investigating a misdemeanour .
i couldn't punch her to get her to talk .
she's a nun .
your turn .
teii me what's going on .
it's a treasure hunt .
each corpse ieads to the next one .
let's say that ... ... sertys , cailois and cherneze are iinked by an incident ... ... that happened 20 years ago .
two days ago they iearn cailois is dead .
we find the body .
they panic .
the past resurfaces .
they go to the cemetery and the school ... ... to check ....
to find something ....
but what?
if judith is reaily dead .
why?
she's seeking revenge .
the nun probably faked her death .
and the prints?
fingers can be cut off .
the guy who shot at me had five fingers .
why did he iet you iive?
so i'd understand his vengeance .
what iinks the three victims?
cailois was head iibrarian .
sertys worked in the maternity ward .
cherneze worked with the dean .
it aii ieads to the university .
i better get back .
what about me?
see if judith is dead .
i knew you'd say that .
i get the fun stuff .
caii me with any news .
what are you doing here?
your coileagues held me for four hours .
sorry .
everyone's on edge .
want a ride?
sure .
so cherneze is dead , too?
did you know him?
one of the coilege's iast dinosaurs .
you don't seem to appreciate the geniuses you iive among .
i don't respect inteilectuals much .
weren't your parents professors?
i don't respect my parents much .
take a ieft here .
is anyone expecting you?
you're a iousy don juan .
thanks .
no problem .
judlth herault
nice place .
i iike it .
it's far from everything .
no tv , no radio ... ... even ceii phones don't work .
a grenade?
thanks .
i use them to trigger avalanches .
are aii the iocals iike you?
battling mountains helps forge your character .
same goes for cops .
have you been one for iong?
too iong .
buy iighter fluid .
i should .
but i'm trying to quit .
it was a gift .
from your ex?
i never got married .
how about you?
almost .
with the dean's son .
that could never work .
it sure was intended to .
after three years face to face in a reading room ... ... you get close .
why do you hate the schooi so much?
why do you suspect me?
you climb mountains .
you found the first body , helped me find the second .
you're the perfect suspect .
except for one thing .
what?
you're incapable ... ... of strangling someone for 10 minutes , eye to eye .
i have to go .
thanks for the tea .
heilo .
teii me about remy cailois's thesis .
he talks about the myth of olympus ... ... greek athletes who combined mind and body .
he refers a iot to the berlin olympic games of 1936 ... ... when german athletes fueiled nazi propaganda .
and " crimson rivers "?
flow with the blood of perfect men .
blood?
veins ....
commissioner .
you want my opinion?
seriously , his thesis is a potpourri of nazi crap .
at the end , it's iike " how to be a perfect fascist .
he explains how to create the perfect man today .
how?
by combining brawny kids with brainy ones .
by selecting them and marrying them .
it's cailed ....
eugenics .
eugenics , that's it .
like nazis tried in some viilages during the war .
like at this school .
healthy minds ... ... in healthy bodies .
what are you doing?
you have no business here !
what role did cailois play exactly?
excuse me?
cailois .
sertys .
cherneze .
it aii ieads here .
what are you after?
you suspect us , don't you?
victims can be guilty , too .
watch what you say , niemans .
i inquired about you .
you're on the razor's edge ....
i'd gladly put you first on the iist .
aii that's stopping me is the desire to prove you're behind it ail .
am i wrong?
am i?
stop it !
are you crazy?
you'ii be hearing from me !
can't i ieave you alone for a minute?
what did you find in the tomb?
i don't know if it'ii be any help .
it's not her .
you know her?
she helped with the case .
she helped you?
to understand the meaning of the " crimson rivers .
they've iived in a closed circuit here for ages .
inbreeding ied the professors to start having degenerate kids .
so they needed new blood .
new blood?
in the maternity wing , they replace professors 'kids ... ... with healthy newborn mountain babies .
sertys's father exchanged fanny with judith?
and plenty of others .
what for?
to create a superior race .
nazis?
a freaking nazi coilege?
not a coilege .
a breeding ground .
who the fuck is it?
shoot !
shoot !
it's builet proof .
aim for the same spot .
go on , shoot !
shoot !
watch out !
are you okay?
who's this bastard?
the dean's son .
what did he want?
to stop us from knowing what they did to fanny .
what could he do to fanny?
he was 10 back then .
he was exchanged .
he was seated with fanny at the iibrary .
he should have married her .
that was the plan .
so then why is she kiiling them aii off?
she refuses to play by their rules .
you think she's innocent?
my coat !
hold on .
a la niemans .
who is this babe of yours?
lady cliff hanger?
shit !
are you stiii not sure?
to think she brought me here !
i could have seen it ail .
she could have operated on you , too !
she didn't want to kiii me .
she ieft me alive .
what are you talking about?
she ieft you alive , but three other guys didn't make it .
your girlfriend's hobby is to cut up her boyfriends .
why the treasure hunt?
what are you talking about?
she's a schizoid !
a psycho kiiler !
she wants us to understand .
what's to understand?
she wants to get caught .
good news .
that's our job , right?
now we just have to find her .
that's our job .
what now?
she took the grenades .
what grenades?
closed up iike a fucking clam ....
did you evacuate the coilege?
i need an explanation first !
it's not the time for explanations .
evacuate .
this can't go on .
who's up there?
i go alone .
it's everyone or no one !
i'm going alone .
everyone , freeze !
calm down ....
no one is coming .
have you gone berserk?
give me that .
trust me .
lower your guns .
we have to go aii the way now .
leave her to me .
down there !
fanny , turn around .
come down .
this is the end .
it's over now .
i know who you are .
you know nothing !

exchanging newborn babies .
kiiling kids .

you'ii kiii innocent people .
they're aii guilty !
no one is innocent !
judith?
twins !
they exchanged twins !
just one .
that's why her face was a threat to them .
take care of her .
so who died in the car accident?
what about the fingerprint?
mommy prepared it ail .
the other giri was already dead .
mommy planned everything .
except your going haywire .
you thought you'd make it?
i don't intend to make it .
freeze , or you reaily won't make it .
stop !
leave her alone !
i'ii trigger an avalanche .
listen to me .
stay away !
the men who hurt you are aii dead .
if you do this , they'ii win .
only you can stop her , fanny .
you're not a monster iike her .
stop before it's too iate .
i have no choice .

and they rejected me .
