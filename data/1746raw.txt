merci malone www . forom . com
last time i checked , babies don't just fall out of the sky , mr .
kent .
it left a 30 foot crater , sheriff .
how else would you explain it?
well , i can't. that's why we're conducting a little something called an investigation .
what's gonna happen to the baby now , sheriff?
well , he'll be placed with child services until we can find a home for him .
you did good for a change , mr .
kent .
the little critter wouldn't be alive if not for you .
dad , this baby's parents ...
i don't think they're from around here .
what do you mean?
you think the baby's ... the baby's not from earth?
we found him in a crater , just like you and mom found me .
yeah , but when we found you , we also found a spaceship .
the truth is , we don't know what happened on that field .
hi .
hi .
i've tried everything , but he won't stop .
is he okay?
if you can believe it , all his crying is a good sign .
the doctor said he's perfectly healthy .
i'm gonna go talk to the nurses , find out if we can get some more formula .
clark , you take over .
me?
yeah .
well , i , lana ...
i don't really ...
wow ,
looks like someone has the magic touch .
i'll be right back .
uh ... when does child services come and take him?
they're not .
they don't have room for him yet , so he's going to stay in the hospital until they do .
well , he can't stay in the hospital .
i mean , he ... maybe he can come stay with us .
until they find room for him .
i found an arrowhead in evans field once , but never a baby in a crater .
it's really weird .
but what's even weirder is the way clark is with him .
let me guess ... he's completely baby phobic .
actually , exactly the opposite .
you should see the look in his eyes when he's holding that baby .
it's like he's completely at ease , not to mention he's a natural born baby burper .
i've got the spit up stains to prove it .
sorry i'm late .
i was up all night with the crying machine and every time i put him down , he starts up again .
well , if you need any help , i could come over tonight .
well , that would be great .
could you pick up some formula on the way?
sure .
how are youon diapers?
the diapers ... pretty good .
okay , before you guys start picking out the schools ... for the little tyke , you might wanna hear this .
i had my contact at emergency services run a check of all the 911 calls made around the time that you found the baby .
this one kinda stuck out .
what the hell's the matter with you people?
it's an emergency !
it's too late !
it's coming !
it's coming !
aah !
she sounds so scared .
no !
no , don't leave me , please !
did he just leave her there?
if he did , he might still be alive .
from the sounds of this , the mother wasn't as lucky .
she didn't even get to see her own baby .
but the baby survived .
how is that possible?
can you trace this call back to the cell phone?
i can try .
if this is the father , he might have some answers for us .
genevieve .
you know , i'm not accustomed to being summoned like a lapdog .
don't be silly , lionel .
i'd never allow you on my lap .
so , uh , why am i here , if not for the , uh , pleasure of your company?
it's time to repay old debts , lionel .
arranging your release from maximum security prison was not an easy task .
and i have yet to receive even a hint of gratitude .
well , i've been racking my brain trying to write a thank you note , but , uh , words could never express the way i feel .
your son just returned from china with a lost element .
and i would like you to retrieve it for me .
no , no , you have the wrong son in mind .
it was jason who brought the stone back home .
jason's incapable of such subterfuge .
unfortunately , he inherited his intelligence from my husband's side of the family .
yeah , i never thought you married well .
lex , on the other hand , received his genes from a far more cunning source .
you know , there were other treasure seekers in china , genevieve .
ha .
a farmboy , an ex cheerleader , and lex luthor .
who do you think ended up with the prize?
well , my son hasn't been listening to me for years .
what do you want me to do , give him a good spanking?
you know , lionel ,
i don't think either one of us want me to go after lex myself .
you be careful , genevieve .
i regard a threat to any luthor as a threat to me .
interpret it any way you like .
i want that stone ,
lionel .
what's the matter?
what's the matter , little guy?
is your milk too cold?
huh?
here , try this .
try this , try this , try this .
huh?
yeah?
there you go .
there you go .
clark , i could easily get chelsea to cover for me at the talon .
you don't have to stay home .
that's okay .
i want to stay with him .
okay .
it kind of changes your perspective when you have someone who depends on you for everything .
yeah .
and i mean everything .
could you hand mea diaper?
here you go .
well , listen , you have my number at the talon , and your dad's out in the barn if you need him .
okay .
okay?
have fun .
yeah .
okay .
clark kent , changing diapers like a pro .
you know , all this baby stuff is easier than people say .
i think i pretty much got it under control .
oh ...
nice aim , little guy .
clark , we can't keep calling him " little guy .
they're gonna make fun of him when he gets to high school .
well , um ... we found him in evans field .
why don't we call him evan?
i think he likes it .
hello , evan .
this is clark , and i'm lana .
and we think that you're the most beautiful baby ever .
you know , lana , maybe weshould take a step back .
step back from what?
well , maybe we shouldn't get so attached .
i mean , if his father's still alive ... then he never should've left him in that field .
lana , we don't know what happened .
he could've gone for help .
he could be looking for evan right now .
or maybe he isn't.
maybe evan is an orphan , just like we were .
clark , things like this don't just happen .
there's a reason he survived and that someone like you found him .
we found him .
evan?
clark , what's happening?
clark , wha ...
my god .
what are you doing , son? an exciting new venture , something worthy of a captain of industry?
i'm simply continuing where you left off , dad .
i , uh , can't talk now .
well , we better talk .
genevieve teague thinks you have the missing element .
the one from china .
come on , dad .
you've raised me to be smarter than that .
why use genevieve teague as a threat?
why not just come out and ask for it yourself?
i'm here as a father who's concerned about the safety of his son .
she had bridgette crosby murdered because of one of those elements .
you think she'd hesitate to do the same to you?
i don't have it .
and even if i did , i'd never trust you .
lex ... we haven't a lot of time left to spend together .
you can go on for the rest of your life being mistrustful of me , or you can accept me as your father who loves you .
she's dangerous , lex .
she ... watch your back , son .
i always do .
where is evan now?
in the loft with lana .
and , mom , i've never seen anything like it .
last night , he was just a baby .
his growth spurt was really amazing .
and frightening .
evan needs to be seen by a doctor .
we have to take him back to the hospital .
what are we gonna tell the doctors ... he's some second generation meteor freak?
he'll either wind up in belle reve or a laboratory for the rest of his life .
i don't know , clark , but we owe it to him to do something .
i was thinking we'd take him to someone who has experience in the effects of meteor rock .
clark ,
i realize that lex has helped us in the past , but there's no way that i'm about to put this young man's life in his hands .
if i were in trouble , and lex was the only one who could help , what would you do?
you must be very kind to him , to teach him all he needs to know in rabbit land .
for he is going to live with us forever and ever .
you know how to read?
i've read all of clark's books .
but this is my favorite .
i also liked the encyclopedia .
the encyclopedia , huh?
that's a pretty long book .
i know .
i stopped on " w.
windmills .
did you know they were invented in persia?
why are you looking at me like that?
um ... you are a very , very special boy , evan .
i think that you are the most special little boy that i have ever met .
really?
yeah .
and you're really lucky , because there are so many more books for you to read and so many places for you to see .
like what?
like a real windmill .
and when you stand up on top of it , the whole world stretches out around you .
can we go right now?
where are you going?
dad !
mom's taking me to see a real windmill .
wanna come?
um ... evan ...
listen ... we're not your real parents .
everyone's supposed to have a mother and father .
and they're supposed to love each other very much , just like you and lana .
clark and i care about you a lot , evan .
that's what matters .
if you're not my mom and dad , where are they?
we don't know , but ... wherever they are ,
i'm sure they love you very much .
you wanna go for a ride in the truck?
are we going to the windmill?
uh ... we will , but first , i want to take you to meet a friend of mine .
i hope i've done the right thing .
clark , he looks really scared .
i just hope it'll be over soon .
lex has his top scientists trying to figure out what's happening .
and they've already come up with some intriguing discoveries .
lex , is he gonna be all right?
tell us what's happening .
well , the results are only preliminary , but ... the data indicates that evan's body is storing energy ,
like a battery charging .
charging for what?
the theory we're working on is that once enough energy is stored , it's expended to fuel a burst of rapid cell division .
that's how he was able to go from a baby to a 7 year old in one day .
is there any way to stop it?
my team believes a bone marrow transplant might slow the growth and bring his metabolism back to normal .
can we use my bone marrow?
we're willing to do anything to help .
well , it's not that simple .
his genetic makeup is highly unusual .
for this to work , we'll need an exact match with a living donor , which means a biological parent .
well , we think his mother died when he was born .
we're still trying to find his father .
what's going to happen to evan if we can't?
evan !
evan .
unbelievable .
what's wrong with me?
prep the level 3 facility .
i want him transferred immediately .
no .
you're not taking him anywhere .
clark , we need to isolate him while we run more tests .
i just want to go home .
lex , he's just a boy .
we understand you're trying to help , and we appreciate it .
he's been through enough .
we're taking him home .
i'm dying , aren't i?
evan , don't say that .
i i read the average
life span of a man is 74 years .
i've aged from a newborn to a teenager in 48 hours .
do the math .
evan , we're not gonna give up .
lex has got his team working on a cure right now .
and if we can find your father ... do you really think they're gonna find a cure for me overnight?
it's like my life was just some sort of trick that was played on me .
all that stuff i read in the books that i thought i was gonna see ...
i'm not ...
am i?
don't talk like that , all right?
we just have to keep trying .
it's not fair .
this whole thing ... it's just not fair !
clark , we have to do something .
we can't just let this happen to him .
would you go see if he's okay?
i need to find his father .
so our friendly phone company just got friendlier .
i was able to trace the 911 call back to a cell phone .
his mother was karen gallagher .
she was a senior here .
i remember hearing about her .
was she wall of weird material?
i got a couple blips on the radar when i heard that she ... had a knack for shorting monitors when ever she walked into the computer lab , but i had no idea that super fast pregnancy powers was part of the equation .
how long was she pregnant for?
well , last weekend , christina varrano had a party at her house , and karen apparently went nc 17 with some guy in the bedroom .
christina has no idea who the guy was .
so she got pregnant and delivered a baby a week later?
we need to find evan's father .
okay .
well , christina used e vite to send out all her invitations .
i guess ours got lost in the electronic mail .
let's just check all the rsvp sand try to track him down .
excuse me .
does tanner sutherland work here?
yeah , he's over there .
thank you .
tanner?
leave your car around back , i'll get to it .
hey , were you at christina varrano's party last week?
uh , i don't remember .
i think i was working .
so you didn't hook up with karen gallagher?
what do you want?
who the hell are you?
i'm the guy who found your son ,
laying in the middle of a field .
look , dude , i don't have a son , and ...
i don't know what you're talking about , all right?
i got work to do .
i'm not going to let you walk away from this .
you have a responsibility .
get off me , man .
what's your problem?
my problem is your son needs your help .
now tell me how he got on that field .
i got with this girl at a party .
the next day , she calls me up , crying , saying she's ... she's pregnant .
i go over , and her stomach ... it was already ...
a week later , we were in my car , we're speeding to the hospital and she's screaming , " it's coming !
and she starts glowing .
and then the car it went up like a freakin 'a bomb .
that wasn't a baby .
it was some kind of monster .
he's a human being , tanner , and he's your son .
he's aging rapidly .
he needs your help .
he needs a bone marrow transplant .
you're the only one who can help him .
what?
no .
look , i can't deal with this .
i'm sorry .
i can't.
how could someone do that to their own son?
clark , being a father is an enormous responsibility .
the kid is just too young to handle it .
he's evan's only hope , and evan's going to die if we can't convince him to help .
i know that , son , and we're gonna figure it out .
but what's more important right now is what are we gonna tell evan?
maybe it's best i don't even tell him i found his father .
he's gonna take it pretty hard .
son , an orphaned child has every right to know about his origins .
you should know that better than anybody .
i'll tell you what ...
i'll talk to him , okay?
i mean , i do have a little experience in that department .
thanks , dad , but i think i should tell him .
tell him what?
did you find my father?
clark , where is he?
he works downtown ... at massey's auto garage .
his name's tanner sutherland .
when can i see him?
look , evan , um , sometimes , when you meet your biological father , it can be painful .
why?
i don't understand .
they don't always live up to your expectations , evan .
trust me , i know .
but i want to see him .
evan , we're just trying to protect you .
you can't protect me .
no one can .
just calm down , okay?
stop telling me what to do , clark .
you're not my father .
evan !
clark .
is there any possibility of an error?
we've run the projections three times .
lex ,
i found evan's father .
where is he?
he's here in smallville , but he doesn't want to help .
i've just been informed that evan's cell division is increasing exponentially , along with the energy he expels when he ages .
we have only a few hours to stabilize evan .
according to the projections , evan is building towards a massive chronological event .
you're saying evan's about to die?
it's a lot worse than that .
the next time evan ages , he'll release enough energy to kill himself and anyone else at hand .
good night .
we're closed .
come back tomorrow .
are you deaf?
what are you staring at?
my father .
don't call me that .
i'm not your dad .
yes , you are .
why won't you admit it?
you stay the hell away from me .
please , dad .
just help me .
i'm your son .
no , you're not !
you're some kind of freak !
dad?
dad?
dad .
oh , my god what have i done?
okay , dad , call me if you find him .
what happened?
evan's gone .
he must've snuck out .
my parents are looking for him , and lana's at the farm in case he comes back .
well , let's make sure we can help him when he turns up .
lex .
he's dead .
evan .
clark , we needed a living donor to stop evan from aging again .
there's gotta be something else we can do to help him .
there is .
we need to track him down and seal him in a containment chamber under luthorcorp .
no .
lex ... it's the only way to contain the blast from his final change .
lex , i'm not gonna let him just die .
nothing can stop that from happening now , clark .
look , i'm sorry , but if we don't isolate evan , a lot of innocent people are going to be killed .
he hasn't come back , mr .
kent .
let me know if you find him .
ok .
evan , i have been worried sick about you .
we've been looking for you all night .
are you okay?
i don't know .
i did something bad .
evan , tell me what happened .
it was an accident ... a mistake .
we all make mistakes .
it's part of what makes us human .
what happened?
are you all right?
it's happening again .
i can feel it .
i'm gonna call clark , and we're gonna get you help , okay?
it's coming .
i can feel it .
there has to be something that we can do .
there is .
the windmill that you told me about , remember?
where the whole world stretches out around you .
i'd like to see it .
just once .
please , lana , hurry .
chloe , has evan been here?
no .
i mean , at the rate he's aging , i'm not even sure i'd recognize him .
he must be with lana .
i keep trying to call her , but all i get is static .
maybe he's putting off an energy field like his mom was .
that would explain the power surges .
power surges?
yeah , they've been popping up all over town for the last hour .
looks , they're happening all over .
what's this?
it's the dwp grid .
see , these are the affected areas .
where's the most recent one?
um ...
10 miles west on the outskirts of town in the middle of nowhere .
why would lana and evan be way out there?
the windmill .
the one at chandler field?
go get 'em , speedy .
you were right .
the whole world is right there .
it's beautiful .
i'm glad you finally got a chance to see it .
lana , you have to go .
no , clark , we have to help him .
there's no time .
you have to go now .
clark ... go .
it's okay .
i'm here .
i'm sorry for what i said .
it's okay , i know .
it's all right .
i'm glad it was you and lana that found me .
i think you found us .
what's happening?
i can feel it .
you better go .
no .
evan , i'm not leaving you .
i wish you had been my father , clark .
evan .
evan .
clark !
clark !
clark , are you all right?
i got clear just before ... where's evan?
he's gone .
i can't believe he's gone .
i know .
me too .
this whole year , i've felt ... so disconnected .
but when evan came into my life , it was like i finally knew where i belonged .
i had a purpose .
he only lived for a short time , but it seems like evan's affected us like we've known him our whole lives .
clark , we think we have all the time in the world , that we're going to live forever , but it's not true .
i guess we should make the most of the time we have before it's too late .
this was his favorite book .
really?
yeah .
it was my favorite book when i was a kid .
i , um ,
i used to pretend that i was the rabbit .
i was just like him , and my parents had brought me to life with their love .
my only hope is that evan felt that way about us .
it's a 1961 bordeaux .
i am honored .
well , i assume your visit means i have ... cause to celebrate .
don't all my visits deserve to be celebrated , genevieve?
some more than others .
mmm ... do you have something for me?
i most certainly do .
to the resolution of our problem .
hmm ...
parenthood ... it's an interesting phenomen on , isn't it?
the lengths we go to ... to protect our children .
no limits .
what are you ...
the wine you've just drunk will kill you in a matter of minutes .
i'm told that the pain will be excruciating .
how about a trade?
you give me the stone that you stole from bridgette crosby , and i give you ... the antidote .
one more thing ... you go near my son , and anything that happens to him happens to you .
is that understood?
the element , genevieve .
where is it?
you did everything you could , clark .
i'm sure evan knew that .
all the times that i've run off or disappeared or almost died , how do you guys deal with that?
it isn't easy , clark , but it does come with the territory .
you see , every parent's greatest fear is that one day they ... will lose their child forever .
it seems like raising a kid is the toughest job in the world .
it's also the most rewarding .
there is nothing quite like watching your son grow up into a young man you can be very proud of .
it's too bad i'll never know what that's like .
why not?
i'm from another planet .
i'm not even human .
who knows if i can have kids?
clark , your father and i couldn't have children .
we were still blessed with a son .
you never know what the future will bring you .
clark .
lana told me you straightened things out with child services .
i appreciate it .
well , i know you grew pretty tight with him .
i promise you , evan's life wasn't in vain .
what do you mean?
well , my team believes studying his unique cellular structure could advance research on cancer and age related diseases by hundreds of years .
i'm releasing our findings to every research facility across the globe .
evan's life may offer hope for generations to come .
he was a special kid , lex .
i can't help wondering what kind of man he would've become .
a good one ... as long as you were in his life .
i bet you're gonna be a great dad someday , clark .
so will you , lex .
i don't know about that .
look , we're all reflections of how we've been raised .
your parents gave you encouragement and support .
my chose the opposite track .
i plan on leaving a different kind of legacy .
well , i better get back to work .
thanks , lex .
mr. luthor ... are you sure you want to release the findings?
eventually ...
