when humans are born , their innate nature is good .
those who are alike in nature , have different habits .
lf you don't educate your children , they will be led astray ...
ah sang , what are you doing?
this is called " hanging from a beam , stabbed on the bottom " .
this superior awl was granted to me by uncle .
lf you don't study hard , i'll stab your bottom with it !
lf you continue to stab me , i'll tell father that you sneaked out to steal bird's eggs .
and that you almost fell into a sewer .
you'll be spanked hard then .
cousin , please don't tell uncle .
what if i let you stab me once instead?
why is it so noisy outside?
uncle's performing a lion dance in the grand salon .
a lot of people are there too .
who's out there?
the leaders of the shaolin , wutang ,
baak hok and wing chun schools of martial arts .
a very enthusiastic crowd indeed .
i see .
they're here again to challenge father to a fight .
that doesn't seem to be the case .
i heard that uncle had invited them over to watch him wash his hands .
wash his hands? !
yes .
lf they're all here to watch him wash his hands , how will he eat and go to the toilet?
let's go see what's happening !
okay .
bravo !
bravo !
good stuff !
good stuff !
bravo !
bravo !
it's reaily good !
not this , not that , not concealed , not knowing ...
mother .
mother , please don't block the view .
you've got some cheek .
coming out here , instead of studying hard in the study !
lf your father found out , he'd spank you !
mother , my queue has straightened out from studying day and night .
your father is doing all this for you !
can it be that my father is washing his hands this time for my sake too?
of course .
wisen up !
lf your father sees you , you'll be whipped again , you know?
yes !
bravo !
bravo !
dear fellow martial arts practitioners .
i invited you here today to use this occasion to wash my hands in a golden basin .
and to announce my retirement from our martial arts world .
brother yeung , your tai chi lmmortal fist fighting style made you famous .
you're respected and admired as one who upholds justice .
why retire?
ever since the allied troops from eight countries invaded china , there's been civil unrest and no peace .
i just wish to live in seclusion and educate my son .
i see ...
father washed his hands so he could teach me the tai chi lmmortal fist fighting style .
that's what you think !
i've been friends with you heroes for decades .
obviously , some approach me with benevolence , some come with hatred .
i'm hoping that after washing my hands in the golden basin ,
i'll be a stranger to the martial arts world .
a smile to eliminate all hatred .
who are you?
sir , forgive my ignorance .
would you please tell us your name?
my surname is wong , but i go by my leg fighting style .
no one could defeat me in the north .
i came today to try out your tai chi lmmortal fist fighting style .
i am determined to retire from the martial arts world .
sir , if you want to compete , just let me say that i have been defeated by you .
father , by saying that , you're being too cowardly !
fight with him !
i have heard that the yeung family style of tai chi is so soft that you seem boneless , but it seems that you're not only boneless , but a coward as well .
okay . lf you won't fight , i'll kick you until you fight .
i read in martial arts novels that the great fighters only fight with their mouths .
that's what it means to reach the highest level .
how about changing it from a martial arts contest to a literary contest?
literary contest?
how?
very simple .
you're only allowed to say the moves 'names , and explain your line of attack and defence .
that will determine the outcome .
that's means it's a kissing fight .
old guy , can you do it?
you are our guest .
please start .
good .
my move is " black tiger stealing heart .
my move is " moving obstructing punch .
right fist rotating to strike your wrist .
i withdraw my right fist and use " shaolin iron sand palm .
i use " moving obstructing punch " again .
i withdraw both hands , and use " consecutive fists .
i still use " moving obstructing punch .
moving obstructing punch? !
you keep using " moving obstructing punch ! " don't you have any other moves?
lf he keeps on using " moving obstructing punch , " he may lose .
what do you know?
watch and learn .
okay .
i'll allow you to see my kicks .
consecutive sweeps , front sweep , back sweep , left sweep , right sweep .
father .
you can use " buddha warrior's backward punch .
backward throw , combined with attack .
okay .
i continue to sweep with my feet .
sweep ... sweep ...
sweep !
stop !
why did you say " stop?
you lost .
which move was the losing move?
you're a woman , what do you know? !
i've been his wife for many years .
of course i know which move is his best !
madame yeung , you are indeed very knowledgeable .
sir ...
when he used his " left and right rising kicks " , you'd have been on the ground before you could make a move .
get lost !
as you wish ...
i have no interest in fighting with words .
let's fight it out properly .
lnclining wind stance " .
white monkey presenting fruit " .
good !
good kicks !
you are the northern king of kicks !
i concede failure .
you're still pretending !
today , either you break an arm or i'll break a leg .
we must decide on a winner .
you and i are members of the martial arts .
why go to such extremes?
i won't just go to extremes , but will kick you all over !
father !
be careful !
wild horse parts mane " .
consecutive brooms of iron !
hands as a cross " .
lron punch " .
i'm sorry .
i used too much strength .
okay .
yeung , i concede .
i will never stop until i defeat you .
predestiny as life , life as tao .
practice of tao : those who follow the way of tao may not stray .
you may stray , but the way will be untrue .
bloodthirsty by nature , nature as tao .

hey !
you're thinking of girls?
gentlemen want to pursue slender girls of good families ...
hok man !
what are you studying?
read out " vast studies .
yes , right away , father .
further learning ... is achieved through practice , decency and morality .
well?
supervising his studies again?
it's a father's fault if one doesn't teach one's son .
okay , okay ...
you wash your hands of the world , and move to hanzhou to live in seclusion .
you lock your son and your nephew in the study like they were in jail .
even if you don't feel for them , it hurts me .
everything has a beginning and an end .
read , quickly !
i'll prick your bottom !
ouch !
mother !
the road to further learning ...
stop playacting !
your mother can't help you !
it hurts me too .
but it's one thing to hurt , and another to be a soft touch .
lf a monkey slips its leash , you'll never catch it again !
you're too fearful .
you shouldn't have asked me to bear a son .
all right .
there are lots of patients waiting outside for you .
go take care of them .
hold this .
a kind mother has many spoiled sons , you know?
i understand .
it's mother .

mother .
i have a question .
ask away .
ls something ... wrong with father?
how can you say that about your father?
lmpudence !
no !
he has me hanging from the beam , my bottom being pricked it's abuse !
abuse?
all he thinks about is girls .
you?
thinking of girls?
come .
you really want to steal the lion's head for fun?
don't you want to see the world?
lf uncle finds out , we'll be in a lot of trouble .
lf father finds out , i'll be responsible !
i'd just get a whipping .
take it from me . ln this world , there are three kinds of people .
what three kinds?
one is the low ranking kind .
all talk , no guts .
another is the middle ranking kind .
they act as they talk .
and the third kind?
like us .
how?
the top ranking kind .
act then talk .
okay .
bravo !
ls this grand enough?
lndeed .

they're not moving .
it's rare amongst mortals !
are you possessed , or what?
yeung wan .
yeung wan .
hi .
it's you .
look , the lion's so funny .
why didn't you tell me you were back so that i could have picked you up?
i came back with my classmates .
why don't you come sit up there?
your father's here too .

yes .
why are you still looking?
she's gone .
okay .
go .
daddy .
yeah?
you're here .
sit .
sit .
it's very exciting .
the auspicious hour is here .
let's offer sacrifices to the dragon king .
what are they doing?
these are traditional practices .
dragon king worship .
they pray for ample rain and plentiful harvest .
offer the sacrifices now .
throw the boy and girl into the river to appease the dragon king .
stop !
you want to commit murder?
how can you throw children into the river and let them drown?
miss , you'll cause trouble if you ruin the ceremony .
offer the sacrifices !
stop !

why don't you go and help?
look how angry the people are !
they're not to be crossed !
daddy !
why don't you stop them?
they're just following the will of the heavens .
i shouldn't have spoiled you !
look at these people .
they're so ignorant .
it's only people like us who studied abroad and open to new ideas , who are able to help these ignorant people .
how do we fight so many?
use the martial arts we secretly learned .
stop fighting !
it's raining !
it's raining !
god , if you wanted to help us , why didn't you pee earlier?

then i'll accompany you home .
you?

what?
can't l?
of course .
then let's go .
you're a real hero to have saved those kids .
today one could drown .
why would one not save others by all means?
why?
all i'm saying is that i'm just doing my part .
hey , hok man !
be careful you don't get the lion's head wet .
huh?
okay .
your name's hok man?
yes .
and yours?
it's " rose " .
rat?
ls this lion's head very valuable?
it's my father's family's treasure .
then let's cover it .
here .
what a rascal !
the first time he steps out , he meets a girl !
that's lun jeng village in front .
you're home .
we still need to walk further .
really?
then let's walk .

uncle .
he's in big trouble .

ah sang , cool or what?

look at you !
what is it with you?
how many times have i told you?
you have to study proper classics , not go outside to cause trouble .
you just don't listen !
mother !
calling out for your mother is useless !
look !
what a mess you've made of this lion's head !
ls it a water lion or a mud lion?
really !
you've made a mess of your father's family treasure !
quickly apologise and then go back to the study and study hard !
i'm not the person who's at fault !
huh?
i'm not at fault either !
lf it isn't you , then whose fault is it?
mine?
it's you .
you treated me like a prisoner for more than 1 years .
lsn't it a bit much?
what?
i'm overdoing it?
for whom did i wash my hands of and retire from the martial arts world?
for whose sake did i leave my hometown , and hide my name?
okay ...
as you're getting beaten to death outside anyway , let me do it instead !
i'll beat you to death !
i'm not wrong !
have you gone mad?
did you have to hit your son's face?
do you want to disfigure his face?
do you want him to be unable to get a wife?
it's a fight to death !
to death !
have you gone mad?
your father's bark has always been worse than his bite .
don't hold it against him .
mother .
i understand him .
but i don't like him locking me in the study , facing four walls and a pile of books !
i don't know anything about the outside world !
son , who was that girl who used a western umbrella to shelter you?
her name is rat .
rat?
it's " rose " , isn't it?
yes . ls it a foreign name?
ln chinese , it means " rose .
rose?
it sounds beautiful .
she's chinese .
why does she have a foreign name?
those who study abroad have english names .
i had one too .
diana .
dai what na?
it's di a na .
it sounds good .
why not pick one for me?
how about jacky?
jacky?
what does it mean?
not much , but ...
when i was in america , in the wild west ,
i really looked up to a hero .
he was called jacky .
rat said i was a hero too .
okay , i'll be jacky .
she called you a hero?
son , you've got hope !
rose is both smart and pretty .
listen to me . lf she's a rat , then you're the cat to catch a rat !
how?
remember ...
to woo this kind of westernised girl ....
mother said i should be a rat catching cat , so i'll wait for the rat .
once she comes out , i'll catch her .
west lake is so big .
lf you don't ask her where she lives , how are you going to catch a rat?
west lake is so beautiful .
even the rats are more beautiful .
rat's appeared !
she's throwing me a love letter .
we must promote democracy and use science to save our country .
what does she mean?
i don't know .
rat !
wait for me !
hey !
rat !
hey !
i'm here !
hok man .
i've had a lot of trouble finding you .
really?
how did you know i was here?
our hearts are secretly connected .
rat , i also have an english name .
from now on , call me jacky .
jacky?
i'll call you " jacky " then .
then we have even more in common .
why do you only know how to say " yes "?
you say " yes , " so i say " yes .
then you can help us distribute the leaflets .
don't say " yes ! " let's go home to study .
i still need to catch a rat .
you go home first and hold the fort .
jacky !
we're selling democracy to save the country !
who wants democracy?
who wants science?
it's free .
get it if it suits you .
it's free .
it's a leaflet .
what's a leaflet?
a leaflet states what we write , which in turn informs you .
i'm illiterate .
how can i read it?
i'll read it out loud .
" let's save this country with democracy .
he's right .
you want rice to cook with , i want your poo to fertilise my fields .
okay .
we'll give you poo , but you need to use scientific methods .
yes , yes .
don't go !
stand still !
not good !
let's go !
lf they catch us , we'll lose our heads !
everyone will lose their heads?
stop jabbering .
let's go !
you want to chop everyone down?
come on !
rose !
rose !
it's the qing soldiers !
let's scram !
where's jacky?
we ran away .
he didn't .
he'll probably be arrested .
how could you leave him behind?
move !
don't run !
chase him down !
chase him !
chase him down !
stand stiil !
stay there !
watch where you're going !
watch out !
let him get down !
my manure is all gone !
hey !
what are you doing?
jacky !
are you okay?
i'm alright .
don't run away !
let's go !
don't run !
stop !
rat , scram !
i'll deal with this !
let me deal with this person , okay?
yeung wan .
hey !
why are you here?
to catch the rebels .
who is this?
he looks familiar .
he's a friend of mine .
you don't have to speak in a foreign tongue .
do you know who i am?
who are you?
her fiance .
fiance?
i'm warning you now .
i don't want to ever see you again with my fiance !
ah wing !
i have the freedom to make my own friends !
jacky ! lgnore him .
let's go !
sir , the foreign girl was handing out leaflets everywhere .
she must be a rebel .
rebel? !
she's mandarin tsao's daughter .
we've hung out since we were children .
our parents arranged our marriage before our birth .
arranged marriage?
yes .
aren't you against feudal concepts of marriage?
yes .
but if we shared the same interests , i would marry him .
what if you don't get along?
then ...
say 'no 'then .
" say 'no '?
this is where i teach and where the children congregate .
teacher , goodbye .
goodbye .
england is so small , but china is so big .
the moment the english devils take on a fighting stance , the qing government gets scared into giving hong kong to england .
lf this continues ...
shenzhen , guangzhou , even hanzhou will become part of the british empire .
yes .
you are correct .
why are you here?
i brought him here .
this is where we discuss matters of state .
how can you casually introduce strangers into this?
i trust him .
i want him to join our democratic save the country party .
i really want to join .
you want to join?
cut off the tail from your head first .
cut off my queue?
why?
each nation has its rules , each profession theirs .
that's one of our rules of joining .
you haven't cut yours?
us?
this humiliation? !
we've all cut it off .
cut !
i can't cut it off .
you're afraid of losing your head !
of course i'm afraid of losing my head , but i'm even more afraid of my father .
what in the world ...? !
we aren't afraid of losing our heads or our blood .
we aren't even afraid of the emperor or the dowager empress .
and you're still afraid of your father !
cut or not?
no .
actually , cutting your queue is a gesture to show you want to save the country .
a famous man once said ,
only by rallying the people , driving away the foreigners , can one save china .
correct .
the theory is great .
ass kisser !
what do you know?
i don't know anything .
what?
confucius says ,
those who play , do not understand ...
once you let go , he doesn't come back !
what's up?
you've finished seeing over one hundred patients already?
hok man !
huh?
do you actually understand or not?
understand .
not knowing is not knowing , knowing is knowing .
not knowing is not knowing , knowing is knowing ...
read clearer !
can you hear me?
your reading is a mess !
i just saw hok man .
he was studying until dawn .
he's got a cold .
a cold?
yes .
it could turn into a lung disease .
hey !
you'd better not disturb him .
go cook medicine for him .
okay .
i'll go cook the medicine .
go , go .
... not knowing ...
stop reciting .
where is he?
i don't know .
mother .
just back now?
you almost got me into trouble .
hey !
you've been gone most of the day .
did you catch the rat?
not even close .
mother , what does " say no " mean?
it's means " to refuse someone " .
what?
did rose say no to you?
no .
mother .
teach me english .
why?
why do you want to learn english all of a sudden?
rat's classmates sometimes speak in english and i don't understand .
now i finally understand that the world outside is so large .
what i want to learn is much more than i am able to learn .
lndeed .
learning has no boundaries .
you want to learn chinese and english .
leave it up to your mother .
repeat after me .
auntie sold horses growing up?
mother , am i getting it almost right?
not almost , but completely wrong !
good son , did i scare you?
you're even scarier than father .
lf you want to catch rat quicker , i have to be stern .
son , got it?
mother , i know what you think .
don't teach me " pyjamas buy big horse .
then what do you want to learn?
first teach me to say 'i love you . '
good boy .
no wonder mother loves you so .
i love you is ...
mother .
did i get it right?
no ... yes .
i hope that when he gets a wife , he won't forget his mother !

jacky !
are you okay?
i'm okay .
what's happening?
you've exposed the foreign devils 'tricks .
you've done a great service .
mandarin tsao .
i heard that some people were attempting robbery at the pier , and so i came to secure the scene .
sir , please leave .
as a customs official , if someone's smuggling opium ...
i can't step aside .
i don't think you could handle this !
my boss's backer is the british empire's east lndia company .
can you afford to deal with them?
colleague , those who know when to do their duty is truly admirable .
why don't you pretend you didn't see this?
go back and smoke some opium .
let me deal with this here .
a crowd is watching , it will be difficult to avoid gossip .
move the tea leaves to the godown .
what do you want to do?
let's just burn aii the opium !
yes !
yes !
burn it all !
good !
burn it all !
good !
daddy , you're doing good !
let's go then !
okay .
the opium was confiscated by customs using your very own hands !
you have to get it back for me .
or else , don't blame me for not saving your face .
mr. smith , you should blame your two subordinates .
they started a fight at the pier .
started a fight?
those people were asking people to quit smoking opium .
they're setting themselves against me .
you should have arrested them .
how dare you threaten a qing government official .
i'm arresting you !
you arrest me?
even your dowager empress has to be polite to us english .
you're just a mandarin !
what do you think you are?
i'm telling you this is chinese land .
it's not for you to act like a bandit , and disregard us !
you're coming back with me to court .
mr. smith .
i will deal with it .
i'm leaving .
brother wing , let's go .
brother wing , let's go !
what?
what?
what are you doing?
teacher above , please accept a bow from your students .
how can i be your teacher?
i haven't studied abroad nor cut my queue .
lucky you didn't cut your queue .
i hope that you'll teach us your " queue move " .
then we won't have to whistle at night , and don't have to scramble away when handing out leaflets .
but your queue is fake .
i don't think that you could do the " queue moves " .
huh?
not succeed?
it's all your fault .
why is it my fault?
i didn't know .
brother magical queue , can this work?
can you teach us?
okay .
lf you want to learn the " queue moves " , you can't be like a frog , do two leaps , and stop for three .
then what shall we do?
it's only after hanging from the beam daily for more than ten years , and by studying hard , did i succeed .
i want to hang from the beam , too .
teacher , i want to hang , too .
teach us .
okay .
let's all hang from the beam .
the three word sutra , that existed in the past , " establish the new .
at this time , learn knowledge , listen to science .
whoever doesn't study hard won't be able to do the " queue moves . " .. separate truth and falsehood , be unafraid of suffering .
be unafraid of tears , eventually , you'll see results ...
i didn't realise that you were good at coaxing kids .
did you really learn the " queue moves " that way?
really .
i really have to thank my father .
ever since i was young , he would hold a whip and hang me from a beam .
that's how i became who i am today .
do you get along with your father?
not at all .
we don't agree on anything , but he's sacrificed so much for me , i'm really grateful .
my daddy loves me a lot , but there's a generation gap .
i hate it when he smokes opium , but he can't quit .
my father is the best at helping people quit smoking opium .
then do you know how?
it's obvious .
not difficult .
daddy !
jacky's here to see you .
uncle tsao .
yeung wan , you've got a good eye .
daddy , what are you talking about?
i brought jacky here to cure you .
cure me?
i'm not sick !
see !
i'm so healthy !
it's this disease .
give it to me .
this is a sickness?
smoking opium makes one happier than an immortal .
these pleasures , you won't understand .
jacky , why don't i raise you to the immortal plane?
lf you inhale a few times , you'll feel like you're afloat , and won't be able to stop .
eh?
no , thank you .
i go east , you follow to the east , i go west , you follow to the west .
bring it there ... come over here .
here , here , here ... come over here , come over there .
hey , jacky !
be careful you don't hurt my father !
no problem .
what kind of kung fu is it?
my arm is stuck to yours , i can't get loose .
this is tai chi's sticky strength , " sticky fist move .
once you let me stick to you , you won't be able to get loose .
see?
i can't believe this .
you're so young , but your kung fu is so good already .
hold on tight , uncle .
uncle tsao , forgive me .
bravo .
lf you learn these moves , you'll enjoy countless pleasures and live a long life .
now , first relax .
close your eyes .
okay .
close my eyes .
relax some more .
close your eyes .
i'm very relaxed already .
correct .
hey !
what are you doing?
what kind of move is this?
this is jacky's family's unique quit smoking opium move .
you got together with him to get me to quit smoking opium?
yes .
i don't want to quit .
uncle tsao , rose is only doing what's good for you .
opium's dangerous .
once addicted , you're not as happy as an immortal , but instead you'll die faster .
yes indeed .
daddy , do you know that the english ban smoking opium in their own land , but ship it to china .
as a parent , you should set a good example , you hear?
do you hear me?
i understand this truth .
ever since your mother died ,
i only have this and you as my treasures .
you're often not by my side .
without this , how can i pass my days?
how's this !
it's either this or me .
choose me , then you definitely won't have this .
lf you insist on choosing this , then i'm going back to america .
stand still !
where are you going?
i'm going to america and not coming back .
get back here !
of course i'll choose you !
i've tried to quit so many times for this precious daughter already .
by tying me up like this , are you sure i can quit completely?
yes .
rest assured , uncle .
it works every time .
then how long do i have to be tied up?
it depends on the depth of your addiction .
lf mild , three to five days .
lf serious , three to five years .
three to five years?
daddy , do you want to back out again?
no , no , no ...
i was just thinking that if this worked , then i should get jacky to help all my subordinates along with me .
okay?
okay !
why don't you let jacky reform your troops?
okay , okay .
jacky , lets 'go .
store your strength like a bow .
use your strength like shooting an arrow .
i'm tired ...
what in the world? !
how can you protect the country like this?
miss , you're just watching .
of course , it's easy for you .
it's obvious you're exhibiting signs of opium addiction , and you're arguing with me? !
look at you !
you're too weak to even hold an opium pipe .
when our superior officer comes to practise with us , he smokes too .
miss , if you let us smoke , you'll see ... a radical change .
shut up !
jacky , teach them a lesson .
listen up .
your superior officer invited me to cure you .
lf you're smart , you'll throw away your pipe yourself , or you can follow the example set by your superior officer .
wake up !
which do you choose?
yeung wan .
why are you here?
why is he here?
daddy invited him .
rebel !
use strength .
last time , because of yeung wan , i let you go .
but you still have the guts to make an exhibit of yourself and deceive me?
mr. lam .
i too have studied the classics .
i'm educated too .
i don't aspire to make an exhibit of myself and deceive .
please forgive me .
what are you doing?
i just wanted to test him .
good for you !
let's take a walk over there .
okay .
jacky , continue practising .
what are you looking at !
continue practising !
what can i do for you?
don't you remember what i told you?
what?
it's my birthday in a few days .
really?
i hope that you'll be able to attend my dance party .
okay .
i will definitely come .
yeung wan .
huh?
let's go and sit down .
you're always hanging out with the fake foreign devils trying to organise ... " democracy and science will save our country?
it's useless .
you'll get your head chopped off .
i know ... but if what we think is so different , what's the meaning in that?
no meaning !!
you're saying that it's meaningless to be with me , but it's meaningful to be with that kid , right? !
what are you talking about?
you know , you've completely changed .
you've buried your conscience .
with your elder brother , you're helping the foreigners smuggle opium .
don't compare me with my brother !
his selling opium , that's none of my business !
i only know that i should rise through the ranks and increase my wealth , so that you can live in luxury , and make my ancestors proud .
everything i do , is for you !
please don't continue !
lf you continue , then i won't want to attend your party anymore .
i understand .
why don't you calm down first ... but i really hope to see you at the party ... in a better mood .
rose , what's wrong?
nothing .
did my presence cause you two to fight?
no ...
do you know how to dance?
i know the " plucking tea leaves " folk dance .
not some tea dance , but " tango " .
tango "?
i've never heard of it .
why don't you show me?
okay .
i'm home !
you're early !
pan frying fish , mother?
look at you !
you look so happy !
did you catch the rat?
rat brought me to her home .
she even invited me to a dance party and asked me to partner her .
then you're almost there !
quickly let your mother hold her grandchild .
mother , stop thinking so far ahead .
rat asked me to dance the " tango " .
but i don't know such things .
what shall i do?
you have me !
this is an opportunity for your mother to show off .
son , did you watch carefully just now?
mother , please teach me .
okay , i'll teach you .
come ...
follow my lead .
did i step on you?
no matter .
let's do it again .
come ... just spin around , around and around and then catch my hands .
mother !
let's not dance .
why?
you're going to hurt yourself .
no worries .
how's this? lf i fall again , i won't call out , okay?
come , again !
turn ... hold my hands ... correct , that was right ... come on ...
that's it ...
mother , i'm sorry .
did i crash into you?
can't you use less strength?
what's the point of always calling on your precious?
you deserve this !
you only know how to be pessimistic .
pessimistic?
your son? ls he ever as good to you as i am? !
really !
you're right .
you're the one who's caring .
do continue rubbing , it's so comfortable .
you can be comfortable ...
there's something i don't want to keep from you .
your son had a big fight with a foreigner's bodyguards today .
fighting?
what if he got his arms and legs broken , then what?
sorry !
don't worry . lf he'd broken his limbs , how would he have gotten home?
on top of that , he was really clever .
not only did he defeat all the foreigner's bodyguards by himself , but he exposed the foreigners 'opium smuggling operations , and became a hero in hangzhou .
what?
he fought with a foreigner's bodyguards and returned unscathed?
by what means?
who's that?
who are you?
you little twerp , don't you recognise me?
i see .
northern king of kicks .
one of my father's defeated foes .
you don't like to face people or what?
disrespectful !
let me teach you a lesson !

come up !
you really aren't coming down , huh !
youngster ... you want to pass your days up there , or come down immediately? !
come down , come down .
okay .
i don't want to come down now .
what can you do?
come up instead !
what are you looking at !
can't hit my son !
why didn't you hit me?
out of breath , old man?
you want to go about the martial arts world with such poor kung fu?
i didn't realise that aside from your dog's paws , you've pig's hoofs !

why haven't you gotten up to practice tai chi?
it's almost time for lunch .
what happened to your face?
nothing .
i just have toothache .
let me see ...
a toothache isn't like this .
it seems like a skin disease .
you women don't know anything .
that type of skin condition only occurs on the midriff , not the face .
lf i say it's a toothache , it's a toothache .
okay ...
lf you say it's a toothache , then it is .
i'll go get you the toothache medicine .
hey !
stand still !
did i ask for toothache medicine?
smart alec !
kindness is wasted on you .
good morning , mother .
good morning .
mother , what's wrong with father?
your father says he's got a fierce toothache .
why are you still standing here?
he's your father , you should go over to see how he is .
okay .
i've come to see you .
what's there to see about a toothache?
go back to study .
what's wrong with you today?
did you take the wrong medication?
mother , don't worry .
father can deal with a little aggravation .
lf we leave , he'll get up immediately .
really?
what are you doing?
rat wants me to go to a party tonight .
party?
i want you to be my stylist .

how did you know how to use my leg fighting style?
i just stole from you .

hey , honourable sir !
how old are you this year?
still practising?
ldiot !

this is between us .
those are the formalities .
mr. wong , welcome , welcome .
mandarin tsao .
this old dress .
i haven't worn it in more than 2 years .
i just took it out yesterday .
how embarrassing .
auntie , don't be so humble .
it's back in fashion in america again .
you say the nicest things .
then i'll be retro then .
mr. yeung , sir .
i was wondering what your thoughts were on a marriage between jacky and rose?
what?
rose and jacky?
what has their marriage to do with us?
huh?
father , i'm jacky .
huh?
you're jacky?
rose , you're going to america for your honeymoon?
i want to go with jacky's father too !
yes , yes !
cool !
my precious daughter has a kind heart , and she at least has aspirations .
but she's got a bit of a temper ...
daddy ...
see ...?
but your jacky's different .
he's learned , cultured , a scholar and a fighter .
he must have been brought up well .
you're too kind , too kind ...
uncle tsao ...
it's all due to my father .
yes , yes ...
yes , yes ...
oh ... no , no ...
mr. tsao , you're kind with your praise .
you're too modest , too modest .
daddy , you only know part of the story .
it's actually auntie who deserves the most praise .
don't be silly ... it's all due to my husband ...
too kind , too kind ...
mr. tsao , i admire your tenacity on being able to quit opium smoking .
thank you .
this is a perfect union between our families .
then let's agree on the marriage between jacky and rose then .
a deal , a deal .
a deal , a deal .

mandarin lam , you bring troops to surround my home .
what's wrong?
what's wrong?
ask your precious daughter !
and him too !
they killed my brother wing !
what?
did you say they committed murder?
we haven't killed anyone .
mandarin lam , don't frame us !
me , framing you? !
brother wing was your fiance , but with your lover , you committed the poisonous act !
huh?
ln recompense for the murder of my brother , you have to pay in blood .
you're coming with me , or do i have to take action?
father , mother , don't worry .
the truth will come out .
take care ...
stop !
come back !
mandarin lam , my son is very disobedient , but i trust him .
he would never commit murder !
you !
it's obvious that you've spoiled your son and he's a killer .
arrest them all !
yes !
don't even try it !
okay .
ten years ago , i went into seclusion for my son ; ten years later , i'll come out of retirement for my son today !
hok man !

let's fight our way out !
you dare resist arrest !
kill them !
why haven't you left yet?
let's leave !

a couple are birds of a feather .
i'm not going to flee in times of trouble !
good wife !
wife , let's go !
who is it?
hey !
what are you doing?
you came just in time .
we saw mr. smith kill lam wing and they were going to frame you !
that's right .
what are you making?
dynamite , to deal with smith .
we found out that he's going to smuggle opium that he stashed away tonight .
then where is it?
jacky !
look behind you !
go to the customs godown , and take back my opium !
find the opium !
are you okay?
classmate chan , are you all right?
chan ...
you've been lucky !
you won't be lucky this time !
you steal from customs , and shoot a man to death !
we won't let you go !
so what?
you murderer !
you're devious .
you killed lam wing !
now i'm sending you to see him .
you foreign devil !
you're despicable !
using a secret western weapon to hurt people !
i'm going to take your life !
you still want to hit with your head? !
i know how to do that too !
come on !
i'll play with you !
youngster !
this foreign devil's fists are very hard .
be careful .
hard?
then i'll pound them until they're soft !
smart boy !
i'll let you be number one in the world then .
what kind of kung fu are you using?
these " queue moves " are especially made to whip villainous types like you !
each whip of the queue has power , huh?
the queue can even come from under my arm !
the queue can come from under the crotch of my trousers !
let's see if you can fly !
want to do " light moves?
you nasty buffoon !
careful , you might fall to your death !
i'm going to fight to the death with you today !
come on !
you nasty buffoon !
you'd better come with me to confess your crimes .
or i'll beat you up so much that your mother won't even recognise you !
come on !
i'll flatten your nose !
you want to play on the ropes with me !
you don't know the meaning of death !
i'll flatten your monkey's head with my feet !
are you more alert now?
one stick of incense in the morning " .
you didn't die from the fall .
thousand weights coming sideways " .
jacky , are you okay?
i'm okay .
then is he dead?
even if he isn't , then he's badly hurt .
move aside !
are you all right?
i'm all right .
it's a secret western weapon .
it's a pistol !
it might misfire .
move aside !
i told you that even if you were hard , i'd beat you till you were soft .
don't move all of you !
your younger brother's murderer is over there !
kill them now !
it's him !
did you really kill my brother?
don't move !
i am a citizen of the british empire .
i've diplomatic immunity .
i demand you put down your weapons !
quickly put down your weapons !
you deserve to die , you damned foreign devil !
let's go !
i need to thank you for avenging my younger brother .
let's go then .
