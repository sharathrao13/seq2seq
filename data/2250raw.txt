mr. michael jennings , under the terms of your non disclosure agreement , you are considered never to have been an employee .
you also understand that all your work is the intellectual property of nexim ...
yeah .
yeah , yeah , yeah .
i never worked here .
i never saw anybody .
i never was here .
i got it .
is my paycheck ready?
alrighty .
how you feeling , tiger?
good .
now let's hear you .
all right .
ready?
yeah .
go !
in order to zero the full eight weeks i had to heat your brain to 42 . 5 c.
i'm fine .
i'm saying it's getting harder , mike .
i said , i'm fine .
you're slowing down .
come on .
i'd be faster if you'd shut up .
show me what you've got , grasshopper .
that's it .
that's more like it !
yes !
go , go , go !
go !
go !
yes !
faster !
beautiful !
yes !

one more , mikey !
see how you did that?
how you focused?
yeah .
i focused on your face .
you know you love me .
come on .
don't be mean to the one who does everything for you .
do you realize you've never once asked me what i see when i erase your memory?
basically , the last two months just never happened for you .
what's to know?
20 hours a day in a clean room ripping off a guy's idea for a computer , selling it to somebody else .
what'd you do the last two months?
the last thing i remember is driving in spain in the aston martin ,
learning to dive in belize with what's her name .
the seven stadiums in seven days trip .
it's great .
i mean , my memories are basically highlights .
it's good .
it's a good life .
the stuff you erase , it doesn't matter .
what is it with guys like rethrick?
he's gotta have everything , huh?
say what you want about jimmy , he started allcom in his garage .
wait , wait .
don't you leave me alone .
what?
you'll be fine .
talk .

i don't want to mingle .
hello .
i'm michael .
i'm rachel .
rachel porter .
is that miss or mrs.?
that would be dr. porter .
doctor .
well , excuse me , doctor .
it's all right .
what kind of a doctor are you?
i'm a biologist .
really?
do you work for jimmy?
it must be very top secret biology that you practice .
oh , yes .
isn't everything?
let's go .
excuse me?
i mean , i'm happy to continue blathering on , trying helplessly to charm you , but i thought maybe , you know , cut to the chase and just , you know , go somewhere .
i'll tell you what , michael .
i'm gonna walk over there and talk to a friend of mine .
if you get the urge to have a real conversation , you'll know where to find me .
ok .
fair enough .
it was nice to meet you .
giving up so easily?
you don't believe in second chances , now , do you?
in my experience , no , i don't .
good night .
good night .
mike .
jimmy .
how you doing?
good .
good to see you .
you too .
thanks for coming .
thanks for having me .

thank you .
wait a second .

<i>alarm disabled . </ i>
i don't think you'd look good covered in foam .
even in that suit .
what's the pitch , jimmy?
i know you're trying to sell me something .
what is it?
when there was a time we were in school , we wanted to change the world .
i thought we wanted to save the world .
well , that's semantics .
what's the job , jimmy?
can't tell you .
other than to say that it involves optics .
and you get stock options for this one .
get a real piece of the company .
what if it doesn't work?
i get a real piece of nothing .
i promise you , it won't fail .
how do you know that?
is this a real crystal ball?
i wish .
the point is , i'll guarantee that you do eight figures .
minimum .
what's the catch?
the job may require a little bit more time than you're used to .
how much more time?
two years .
maybe three .
you're kidding .
deadly serious .
jimmy , that's impossible .
you can't do it .
the longest ever is eight weeks .
it was me .
assuming it were possible , would you do it?
give up three years of my life?
not give up , trade .
three years in return for the rest of your life .

you can still back out .
no hard feelings .
no , i want to stay .
michael jennings , meet the other half of your team , dr. william dekker .
nice to meet you .
it's a pleasure .
gentlemen .
let's have a look at the next three years of your lives .
what happened?
michael .
you're done .
<i> how long was it , jimmy? </ i>
<i> it's been three years , mike . </ i>
<i> how'd i do? </ i>
<i> you did good . </ i>
<i>your money's been transferred</ i> <i>to your account at reddy grant . </ i>
<i>you've got an appointment</ i> <i>there at 1 : 00 . </ i>
<i>just go home , do the paperwork . </ i>
<i>when you feel up to it , give me a call . </ i>
<i>we've got a lot of catching up to do . </ i>
ninety two million dollars .
everyone at reddy grant appreciates your business .
well , not as much as i appreciate my business , i promise you .
ok .
just sign there .
all right .
great .
your personal items .
yes .
you only needed four stamps .
oh , well , guess i could afford the extra 50 cents .
i don't think this is my stuff .
it's not?
no .
i don't know what happened .
it's all right .
don't worry about it .
it doesn't matter .
let's talk about my shares .
what i'd like to do is get some money now , and , you know , put the rest away for long term , to live off .
so how do we do that?
mr. jennings , you forfeited your shares .
i beg your pardon?
what?
yeah , here .
dated four weeks ago .
you surrendered the shares and stated to deliver only the envelope of personals .
don't you remember doing that , sir?
no .
i don't remember that , because i didn't do that .
why would i do that?
i wouldn't do that .
it doesn't make sense .
a mistake has been made , and it needs to be corrected .
i agree .
it's a strange thing you did ...
it's not strange .
strange is a little out of the ordinary , but still plausible .
giving away $100 million in shares in a fortune 500 company for some knickknacks isn't strange , it's insane .
no one would do that .
doesn't make sense .
unless you think this is a $40 million can of hair spray , which is pink .
what , this is a $100 million book of matches?
i've been out of it a few years .
is this back in style now?
are these $100 million sunglasses?
i'll look into it , but it's gonna take me some time .
this is crazy .
i'm gonna make some phone calls .
<i>mr .
rethrick's office . </ i>
it's michael jennings .
it's important .
<i> i'm sorry , he stepped away . </ i>
<i>he won't be back until</ i> <i>this afternoon . </ i>
<i>i can try him on his cell phone . </ i>
just have him call me as soon as he gets in .
ok?
<i> ok . </ i>
thank you .
listen , guys , a mistake has been made here .
all right?
i'm not a traitor .
i'm an engineer .
a reverse engineer , right?
we know that you accepted payment of classified government technology .
mike , that's called treason .
in this country , people get fried for that one .
in this country when the fbi harasses you , you also get an attorney .
not today you don't .
what the hell is this?
the attorney general calls me and says that michael jennings 'cooperation is a matter of national security .
look , first of all , that stuff isn't mine , ok?
a mistake ...
what is ...?
perfect fit .
you were saying?
well , let me show you a few pieces of the puzzle that we're solving .
william dekker , government physicist , weapons division .
three years ago , his project gets shelved .
he didn't like that , so he sold his work .
classified work .
showed it to several corporations .
we think rethrick bought it .
unfortunately , we can't link rethrick to the sale , because dekker died .
natural causes .
natural " being gravity after a 140 foot fall out of his apartment building .
what does this have to do with me?
patent applications filed this month .
they show designs based on dekker's work .
look whose signature is on every one of those documents .
get it?
it's your name on those patents !
rethrick can claim he knows nothing about dekker or the design .
you need to tell us everything you did for rethrick .
i can't .
you'd rather spend your life in prison protecting your friend?
help us , and we can work with you .
i can't .
i can't !
he wiped my memory !
i don't remember !
i'll tell you whatever i know .
i was set up .
believe me .
i don't remember what i did for the past three years !
what?
wait a second !
wait !
we figured rethrick tried a wipe , so we'll try an extraction .
you're not gonna see anything .
you're wasting your time .
we're getting something here .
come on !
come on !
shit .
we got nothing .
hold on a second .
i need a smoke .
hold on a second .
i need a smoke .
boss .
he won't mind .
smoke !
shit !
goddamn it !
i can't see anything !
secure the door !
where the hell is he?
he's loose !
don't worry , he can't go anywhere !
cover the door !
i'll get the lights !
i can't see !
get low to the ground !
stay low to the ground !
mitchell !
see anything?
is that him?
klein , where'd you go?
al , shut the door !
what's going on?
good night , mikey .

i'll get men at every stop !
he'll be long gone by then !
how the hell did he do that?
sorry .
you all right?
yeah , yeah .
i'm fine .
be careful .
hey !
hey !
watch it !
hey !
hey !
jane .
relax .
everything's fine .
you talked to federal agents .
it's ok .
it's been worked out now .
i just need to find out who sent these items .
will you help me out?
they were sent three years ago .
no .
there was a mix up .
somebody else sent these .
i need to find out who that is and talk to them .
replacements were sent a few weeks ago .
who sent it?
well , you did .
that's you right here .
see?
twenty items .
<i>i'm gonna need all</ i> <i>your personal belongings . </ i>
<i>michael jennings died</ i> <i>at three minutes after 3 . </ i>
the government , left with no case , closed its investigation of allcom .
so you see , it's impossible that he escaped unless you changed something .
i didn't .
what were you doing , exactly?
i was eating pie .
he left the attorney's office exactly when it predicted .
the feds took him exactly when it predicted ...
but he didn't die like it predicted !
michael jennings is not a super agent .
he's an engineer .
yet somehow he managed to escape from a double iocked room .
how?
was it fate?
no , fate was on our side .
that means someone changed something .
and it wasn't me .
and if it wasn't you , then who the ...?
has anyone checked the machine since michael walked out of here?
find him .
if you only look where you can't go ,
you will miss the riches below .
yeah , i'm already missing my riches .
17 44 4 26 37 40 22 .
a combination?
a code?
a password?

new liberty savings bank , please .
what does that mean?
you're saying the bank doesn't exist?
that's comforting .

i'm in a jam , and i need you .
<i>all right . </ i>
<i>all right . </ i>
<i>meet me at union station at 9 : 00 . </ i>

<i> ok , buddy</ i> .

<i>eastbound spokane , gate ten . </ i>
<i>michael . </ i>
say one word about this hat and i'm out of here .
oh , man !
oh , my god .
i told you not to take that job , mike .
come on , let's get a table .
ok .
injections?
yeah .
you would have to do it that way , i guess .
but , of course , that's a chemical process .
so?
well , you'd have some latent memories .
maybe that's what i'm seeing .
most likely .
memories that made it through the wash , stirred up when the feds went in your head .
why would i have these things?
explain this .
i sent myself this junk instead of the money .
oh , brother .
i don't know .
that's not the question you should be asking .
no?
no .
you should be asking yourself , why did you give up all that money?
that's the most bizarre part of this whole thing .
ninety million dollars .
nobody changes that much in three years .
ok , all right , buddy .
i wanna figure out what you built .
all right , let's work backwards .
they told me i was working on a design by someone named dekker .
dekker?
yeah .
william dekker?
i think so .
what i heard was , he was working on something level five for the feds .
they came in , shut him down .
what was it?
well , the consensus was a laser .
why?
because dekker's drawings called for a mirror and a lens .
the only thing that uses those is a laser or a satellite camera to see things from far away .
<i>here comes the first number , 17 . </ i>
<i>followed by 44 . </ i>
the lens required perfect optics .
<i> four</ i> .
the mirror ...
<i> twenty six . </ i>
so the capital outlay is huge .
<i> thirty seven</ i> .
word was it was gonna cost <i> forty</ i> .
500 billion dollars .
<i> and</ i> <i>the bonus number is 22</ i> .
who's gonna spend 500 billion dollars just to see something?
what?
no way i get out of that extraction room without the cigarettes and the glasses .
i would've never gotten on the bus without the ticket .
if i didn't have the ring , i wouldn't have followed that kid to reddy grant .
right .
i gave up that money just to make sure that i would pay attention to these items .
why?
because i know what you'd spend 500 billion dollars to see .
the future .
<i>if you selected five numbers</ i> <i>and the bonus number, </ i> <i>you're a second prize winner . </ i>
he used a virus .
the machine went down at 3 : 03 this afternoon .
3 : 03 .
can you program around the virus?
no .
it's not that kind of virus .
come on , i'll show you .
it's not in the software .
it's in the hardware .
he put a circuit somewhere in here .
it's like a poison pill .
but you can find it , right?
yeah , i can .
then do it .
slight change of plans .
according to mr. stevens , we don't need jennings .
look , if we know anything , we know that time travel's not possible .
einstein proved that , right?
time travel , yes .
but einstein was very clear that he believed time viewing
theoretically could be accomplished ...
mike , mike .
come on .
maybe we should just find dekker ...
i can't talk to dekker .
why not?
he had an accident .
an accident?
yeah , he ...
he fell out of his bedroom window .
fell out of ...?
he fell out of his bedroom window !
i see .
sure .
that could happen .
jesus .
wait a minute !
we've gotta get out of here !
shorty , listen to me .
i think what happened was i used this thing , i saw my future .
and i saw what i needed to change it .
but all i could get out of allcom were these innocuous items .
each item has to be used at a specific time and place to accomplish whatever i needed to get done .
i mean , without the stuff in here , i'd already be dead .
yeah , well , it's too bad that you don't know what the rest of them are for .
what?
gotcha !
hey !
great seeing you again , mike !
jesus !
those guys do not look like feds .
here .
listen to me .
take this .
this will get you through that door .
close it behind you .
understand?
go !
ok !
go !
go on !
shit !
go !
oh , god , i hope that was a good thing to do .
shit .
go .
where's your gun?
he's got it .
so ... ... how are you , mike?
you?
why?
don't remember?
you brought this on yourself , mike .
so how does it feel knowing you're going to die?
shit .
he designed his own escape?
mr. attorney general , sir , we have no explanation .
after looking at the evidence the only logical , albeit hard to accept conclusion , is he was able to predict what was going to happen to him .
these are memories extracted from jennings before he fled .
they don't seem to add up to anything .
gladys .
that's all for today .
we knew dekker was trying to design something , but when he sold his plans , he wasn't even halfway done .
i don't understand .
dekker was working at jpl on a laser enhanced lens .
he claimed the lens was powerful enough to see around the curvature of the universe .
he believed if you could see around a curve that went on forever you would end up back where you started ,
looking at yourself .
except you're not looking at yourself now , in the present .
no , you are not .
you're looking at the future .
imagine what will happen if jennings figures it out and tries to profit from it .
any nation will give a king's ransom .
he won't do that .
i was this close .
he never lied .
when he was accused he was hurt and scared .
bring him in , i'll give him the medal of honor .
that's if rethrick doesn't find him first .
you think he really saw the future?
that would be something .
caf michel?
my name is michael jennings .
and i can't remember if i made a reservation there recently .
would you check that out for me?
thanks .
i did?
ok .
right .
how many is it for?
oh , no , thank you .
no , i'll be there .
thank you .
hello , you two .
did he feed you?
rachel , it's jimmy .
you all right?
why?
you don't know?
no .
may i come in?
when was the last time you saw michael?
yesterday morning .
he was pulling an all nighter at his lab .
rachel , i'm sorry to have to be the one to tell you this .
michael left allcom yesterday .
permanently .
what?
he finished his work .
we erased his memory , and he ...
no .
he left .
no .
he promised me .
he said he wasn't going to go through with it .
he made a lot of money on this one , rachel .
he said he didn't care about the money .
so she doesn't know anything .
he wouldn't leave without her .
it's michael .
he'd be smart .
we're missing something .
soon as she leaves for work , get in there .
make sure she can't go anywhere alone .
<i>i want to know</ i> <i>what just happened . </ i>
