i would like , if i may ... ... to take you on a strange journey .
it seemed a fairly ordinary night ... ... when brad majors and his fiance , janet weiss ... ... two young , ordinary , healthy kids ... ... left denton that late november evening ... ... to visit a dr. everett scott ... ... ex tutor and now friend to both of them .
it's true there were dark storm clouds ... ... heavy , black and pendulous ... ... toward which they were driving .
it's true also that the spare tire they carried ... ... was badly in need of some air .
but they , being normal kids and ... ... on a night out ... ... they were not going to let a storm spoil the events of their evening .
on a night out .
it was a night out ... ... they were going to remember ... ... for a very long time .
<i>i have never been a</ i> q<i>uitter , </ i>
<i>to leave office before my term</ i> <i>is completed is abhorrent ... </ i> <i> ... to every instinct in my body , </ i>
<i>but as president ... </ i> <i> ...
i must put the interests</ i> <i>of america first , </ i>
<i>america needs a full time president ... </ i> <i> ... and a full time congress ... </ i> <i> ... particularly at this time ... , </ i>
gosh , that's the third motorcyclist that's passed us .
they sure do take their lives in their hands .
yes , janet .
life's pretty cheap to that type .
what's the matter , brad , darling?
we took the wrong fork a few miles back .
oh .
where did that motorcyclist come from?
i guess we'll just have to turn back .
what was that bang?
we must have a blowout .
damn it !
i knew i should've gotten that spare tire fixed .
you stay here and i'll go for help .
we're in the middle of nowhere .
didn't we pass a castle a few miles back?
maybe they have a telephone i could use .
i'm going too .
both of us don't need to get wet .
i'm coming with you .
besides , the owner of that phone might be a beautiful woman ... ... and you might never come back again .
<i>in the velvet darkness</ i>
<i>of the blackest night</ i>
<i>burning bright</ i>
<i>there's a guiding star</ i>
<i>no matter what</ i>
<i>or ... </ i> <i> ... who you are</ i>
<i>there's a light</ i>
<i>over at the frankenstein place</ i>
<i>there's a light</ i>
<i>burning in the fireplace</ i>
<i>there's a light , light</ i>
<i>in the darkness</ i>
<i>of everybody's life</ i>
<i>the darkness must go</ i>
<i>down the river</ i>
<i>of nights dreaming</ i>
<i>flow morphia slow</ i>

and so ... ... it seemed that fortune had smiled on brad and janet ... ... and they had found the assistance that their plight required .
or had they?
brad , let's go back .
i'm cold and i'm frightened .
just a moment , janet .
they may have a phone .
hello .
hi !
my name's brad majors .
this is my fiance , janet weiss .
i wondered if you might help us .
our car broke down up the road .
do you have a phone we might use?
you're wet .
yes , it's raining .
yes .
oh .
i think , perhaps , you better both come inside .
you're too kind .
i'm frightened .
what kind of place is this?
it's probably some kind of hunting lodge for rich weirdos .
this way .
are you having a party?
you've arrived on a rather special night .
it's one of the master's affairs .
oh .
lucky him .
you're lucky .
he's lucky , i'm lucky , we're all lucky !

mercy !
how did it happen?
i understood you were to be watching .
i was only away for a minute , master .
well , see if you can find him on the monitor .
master .
master , we have a visitor .
hey , scotty !
dr. everett scott .
you know this earthling ... ... this person?
i most certainly do .
he happens to be an old friend of mine .
i see .
so this wasn't simply a chance meeting .
you came here with a purpose .
i told you , my car broke down .
i was telling the truth .
i know what you told me , brad .
but this dr. everett scott , his name is not unknown to me .
he was a science teacher at denton high .
and now he works for your government .
he's attached to the bureau of investigation ... ... of that which you call u<i>f</ i>os !
isn't that right , brad?
he might be .
i don't know .
the intruder is entering the building , master .
he'll probably be in the zen room .
shall we inquire of him in person?
great scott !
<i>f</ i>rank n. <i>f</ i>urter .
we meet at last .
dr. scott !
brad !
what are you doing here?
don't play games , dr. scott .
you know perfectly well what brad majors is doing here .
it was part of your plan , was it not?
that he and his female should check the layout for you?
well , unfortunately for you all , the plans are to be changed .
i hope you're adaptable , dr. scott .
i know brad is .
i assure you , brad's presence comes as a complete surprise to me .
i came here to find eddie .
eddie?
i've seen him .
he's ...
eddie?
what do you know of eddie?
i know a great deal about a lot of things .
you see , eddie happens to be my nephew .
dr. scott .
janet !
dr. scott !
janet !
brad !
rocky !
janet !
dr. scott !
janet !
brad !
rocky !
listen !
i made you ... ... and i can break you just as easily .
master , dinner is prepared !
excellent .
under the circumstances , formal dress is to be optional .
the breaking of bread , the last meal of the condemned man ... ... and now this meal .
<i>however informal it might appear ... </ i> <i> ... you can be sure there was to be</ i> <i>very little bonhomie , </ i>
a toast .
to absent friends .
to absent friends .
and rocky .
<i>happy birthday to you</ i>
<i>happy birthday to you</ i>
<i>happy birthday , dear rocky</ i>
<i> happy birthday ... </ i>
shall we?
we came here to discuss eddie .
eddie !
it's a rather tender subject .
another slice , anyone?
excuse me .
i knew he was in with a bad crowd , but it was worse than i imagined .
aliens !
dr. scott !
go on , dr. scott .
or should i say dr. von scott?
just what exactly are you implying?
it's all right !
that's all right , brad .
<i>from the day he was born</ i>
<i>he was trouble</ i>
<i>he was the thorn</ i>
<i>in his mother's side</ i>
<i>she tried in vain</ i>
<i>but he never caused her</ i> <i>nothing but shame</ i>
<i>he left home ... </ i> <i> ... the day she died</ i>
<i>from the day she was gone</ i>
<i>all he wanted</ i>
<i>was rock 'n 'roll porn</ i>
und <i>a motorbike</ i>
<i>shooting up junk</ i>
<i>he was a low down , cheap little punk</ i>
<i>taking everyone for a ride</ i>
<i>when eddie said</ i> <i>he didn 't like his teddy</ i>
<i>you knew he was a no good kid</ i>
<i>but when he threatened your life</ i> <i>with a switchblade knife</ i>
<i> what a guy</ i> <i> makes you cry</ i>
und <i>i did</ i>
<i>everybody shoved him</ i>
<i>i very nearly loved him</ i>
<i>i said , hey , listen to me</ i>
<i>stay sane inside insanity</ i>
<i>but he locked the door</ i> <i>and threw away the key</ i>
<i>but he must've been drawn</ i>
<i>into something</ i>
<i>making him warn me</ i>
<i>in a note which reads : </ i>
<i>what's it say?
what's it say? </ i>
<i>" i'm out of my head</ i>
<i>oh , hurry , or i may be dead</ i>
<i>they mustn 't carry out</ i> <i>their evil deeds" </ i>

oh .
oh , rocky !
how could you? !
this way !
this way !
shut up !
<i>i'll tell you once</ i> <i>i won 't tell you twice</ i>
<i>you'd better wise up</ i> <i>janet weiss</ i>
<i>your apple pie</ i> <i>don 't taste too nice</ i>
<i>you'd better wise up</ i> <i>janet weiss</ i>
<i>i've laid the seed</ i> <i>it should be all you need</ i>
<i>you're as sensual as a pencil</ i>
<i>wound up like an e or first string</ i>
<i>when we made it</ i> <i>did ya hear a bell ring? </ i>
<i>you got a block</ i> <i>well , take my advice</ i>
<i>you'd better wise up</ i> <i>janet weiss</ i>
<i>the transducer</ i> <i>will seduce ya</ i>
my feet !
i can't move my feet !
my wheels !
my god , i can't move my wheels .
it's as if we were glued to the spot .
you are .
so quake with fear , you tiny fools .
we're trapped .
<i>it's something you'll get used to</ i> <i>a mental mind fuck can be nice</ i>
no !
you won't find earth people the easy mark you imagine .
this sonic transducer ... ... it is some kind of audio vibratory , physiomolecular transport device?
you mean ...?
yes , brad .
it's something we ourselves have been working on for a while .
but it seems our friend here has found a means of perfecting it .
a device capable of breaking down solid matter ... ... and then projecting it through space , and who knows ... ... perhaps even time itself !
he's gonna send us to another planet?
planet schmanet , janet .
<i>you'd better wise up</ i> <i>janet weiss</ i>
<i>you'd better wise up</ i> <i>build your thighs up</ i>

<i>frank furter</ i>
<i>you're a hot dog</ i>
my god !
i can't stand any more of this .
<i>f</ i>irst , you spurn me for eddie , then you toss him like an old coat for rocky .
you chew people up and then you spit them out again .
i loved you .
do you hear me?
i loved you .
and what did it get me?
i'll tell you , a big nothing .
you're like a sponge .
you drain others of their love and emotion .
well , i've had enough !
choose between me and rocky , so named because of the rocks in his head .
it's not easy , having a good time .
even smiling makes my face ache .
and my children turn on me .
rocky's behaving just the way that eddie did .
maybe i made a mistake ... ... splitting his brain between the two of them .
i grow weary of this world !
when shall we return to transylvania? !
magenta ... ... i am indeed grateful to both you and your brother , riff raff .
you have both served me well .
loyalty such as yours shall not go unrewarded .
you'll discover that when the mood takes me , i can be quite generous .
i ask for nothing , master .
and you shall receive it in abundance !
come .
we are ready for the floorshow .
<i>and so , by some extraordinary</ i> <i>coincidence ... </ i> ... fate , it seemed , had decided that brad and janet ... ... should keep that appointment with their friend dr. everett scott .
but it was to be in a situation ... ... which none of them could have possibly foreseen .
and just a few hours after announcing their engagement ... ... brad and janet had both tasted ... ... forbidden fruit .
this in itself was proof ... ... that their host was a man of little morals ... ... and some persuasion .
what further indignities were they to be subjected to?
and what of the floorshow that had been spoken of?
in an empty house ... ... in the middle of the night?
what diabolical plan ... ... had seized <i>f</ i>rank's crazed imagination?
what indeed?
<i>f</ i>rom what had gone before , it was clear ... ... that this was to be no picnic .
<i>it was great when it all began</ i>
<i>i was a regular frankie fan</ i>

how sentimental .
and also presumptuous of you .
you see , when i said " we " ... ... were to return to transylvania ... ... i referred only to magenta and myself .
i'm sorry , however , if you found my words misleading ... ... but you see ... ... you are to remain here .
in spirit anyway .
good heavens , that's a laser .
yes , dr. scott .
a laser capable of emitting a beam of pure anti matter .
you're going to kill him?
what's his crime?
you saw what became of eddie .
society must be protected .
exactly , dr. scott .

no .
no .
no !

you killed them .

they liked you .
they didn't like me !
they never liked me !
you did right .
a decision had to be made .
you're okay by me .
dr. scott ... ... i'm sorry about your nephew .
eddie?
yes , well , perhaps it was for the best .
you should leave now , dr. scott , while it is still possible .
we are about to beam the entire house ... ... back to the planet of transsexual ... ... in the galaxy of transylvania .
go .

our noble mission is almost completed ... ... my most beautiful sister .
