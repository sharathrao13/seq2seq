rimma .
she was in art school for a couple of years .
i see .
what the fuck should i do?
what do you think?
come see our show tonight .
please , that's not what i meant .
still .
what should i do?
tell me .
i don't know .
please , let's sort this out now .
i know what i must do but ...
but i don't !
get it?
i didn't want this to happen to you .
tell me .
ask i ching .
is this it?
have a look .
is this what this is all about?
no .
is this it?
i make my own decisions .
you're not even a good clown .
right .
this is all fake .
i'm not buying any of this .
you're fucking nuts .
i don't even know you anymore .
i'm just happy .
you're fucking nuts .
don't you understand?
they're taking you for a ride .
this is all fake .
nobody will buy this .
nobody can ... fuck .
don't you understand what she's like?
you don't even understand what she's like , do you?
i'm telling you i've seen many of them .
a soft goddam fairy .
soft chocolate on top and ...
goddammit ...
it's not even your kid .
you don't owe them anything .
no .
no .
you just happened to be around and that's it .
somebody else fucks her , god knows who and you walk in and take care of things .
a nice boy like you .
how could you be a dad?
you're just a kid yourself .
how could you know anything about it?
you know nothing about it .
you'll parade around here all summer , barefoot and then what?
turn it off .
what did you say in helsinki?
that you love her .
yes?
what did you mean by it?
that i love her , of course .
yeah , but what does it mean?
i can't explain it .
try .
i've tried .
i don't have to .
it doesn't go like that , joni .
i've seen it so many times , been involved ...
all the people i've seen ...
it just comes and goes , starts and dies out .
that's it .
it's all fake .
people say that they're happy and doing good when they just don't have the guts to break up .
would that make them happy?
why would you be a goddam exception?
at least they'd be independent , you know .
that's all you have , yourself .
that's all you've got .
figure out what you want and what you really think or feel about things .
that's all you've got .
that's what you've got to live with .
it's just bullshit the full package they're offering .
and you're not buying?
no .
and you shouldn't either .
i'm not buying any packages .
don't bet your entire life on such a card .
no thanks .
are you my brother?
yes .
prove it .
i'm telling you : there is no secret around the corner .
that's a fact .
you can find peace by denying everything .
nothing means anything , you have no will or dreams .
but you must know that it's a dangerous road .
you'll share dad's fate .
what fate?
he went nuts .
he went crazy from the same stuff .
the same goddam i ching and other bullshit .
not true .
of course it is , ask mom when she gets here .
is she coming here?
yes .
did you ask mom here?
of course i did .
idiot !
this is not good , not at all ...
i think i figured something out .
yeah .
i don't really care what happens to us , sanna .
i went to spain with a friend of mine .
we had been there for some weeks and ended up in san sebastian .
for some reason , i don't remember why
i decided to spend a day alone and went to the beach .
i'd been there for a while when i noticed
leaning against the fence a really beautiful spanish girl .
she was eating an orange without using her fingers .
i can't explain it any better .
anyhow ...
i started thinking what to do
and went for the old trick of asking for a light although i had some matches in my pocket .
we talked some german and some french and i felt really good around her .
then she told me that a friend of hers was having a birthday party in some mountain village and invited me there .
she kissed me lightly and left .
i went straight back to where we were staying and told my friend what had happened .
we started planning the future and how many kids i would have and where we'd live and what car we'd drive .
then we went to buy me a new shirt .
then the bus comes and it stops .
the doors open and some people get off .
i'm standing there and i realize that my feet are not moving .
i can't move , i'm just standing there .
then i take off
go downtown and get drunk .
fuck ...
i've thought about it every week ever since .
i still don't know if this was my chance of a lifetime .
or is this just some stupid longing
i can't get rid of .
perhaps you'll understand what i mean by this .
bye , joni .
do what you used to do when we were kids .
what?
the thing with your head .
no way !
no fucking way !
start the engine .
no , from here ...
is that what you meant?
but check this ...
your turn .
thanks .
it's joni's .
i'm sorry if i messed things up for you here .
thanks .
this is sami moldakoff .
sorry , i know you're busy but i have a question .
is it at all possible to recover from this illness without treatment?
is it possible that such a miracle would happen?
yeah ...
joni asked me not to tell you but i have to tell you before i go back home .
joni is ill .
he has leukemia and it has returned .
he should be in helsinki for treatments .
his doctor called me and told me to bring him back .
that's why i'm here .
understand?
the doctors say that without treatment his chances of survival are one in a hundred thousand .
i really don't know what to do .
hey ...
joni keeps saying he's fine and refuses to leave .
why are you sitting here?
and sulking .
is rimma upstairs?
no .
where is she then?
i told her everything .
i don't know where she went .
i had to tell her , dammit !
don't you understand?
joni !
did you find her?
yeah .
well?
why are you still here?
i wanted to see you .
i'm leaving tomorrow morning .
sami .
sami !
sami !
i want out of here , now .
what's wrong?
joni ...
are you in pain?
no .
sami moldakoff , we're here to get a passport .
apply for one , i mean .
