to drink a tall glass of orange juice ... and a black cup of coffee .
after that , i'm going to have a slice of pie .

oh , god , please .
i don't wanna die .
you read the bible , brett?
yes !
well , there's this passage i got memorized .
sorta fits the occasion .
ezekiel 25 : 17 .
the path of the righteous man is beset on all sides ... by the inequities of the selfish ...
and the tyranny of evil men .
blessed is he who , in the name of charity and good will , shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness , for he is truly his brother's keeper ... and the finder of lost children .
and i will strike down upon thee with great vengeance ... and furious anger ... those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers .
and you will know my name is the lord ... when i lay my vengeance upon thee .
i'm fucked .
oh , fuck .
oh , fuck .
is he a friend of yours?
oh , goddamn .
goddamn .
hmm?
oh .
vincent , marvin .
marvin , vincent .
better tell him to shut up .
he's gettin 'on my nerves .
fuck .
marvin .
marvin !
i'd knock that shit off if i was you .
die , you motherfuckers !
die !
why the fuck didn't you tell us somebody was in the bathroom?
slip your mind?
did you forget that someone was in there ... with a goddamn hand cannon?
you see the size of that gun he fired at us?
it was bigger than him .
we should be fuckin 'dead , man .
i know .
we was lucky .
no , no , no , no .
that shit wasn t luck .
yeah , maybe .
this was divine intervention .
you know what divine intervention is?
i think so .
that means that god came down from heaven and stopped the bullets .
that's right .
that's exactly what it means .
god came down from heaven and stopped these motherfuckin 'bullets .
i think it's time for us to leave , jules .
don't do that .
don't fuckin 'blow this shit off !
what just happened here was a fuckin 'miracle !
chill .
this shit happens .
wrong !
wrong .
this shit doesn't " just happen .
do you want to continue this theological discussion in a car ... or in a jailhouse with the cops?
we should be fuckin 'dead , my friend !
what happened here was a miracle , and i want you to fucking acknowledge it !
all right , it was a miracle .
can we go now?
let's go , nigger !
come on !
shit .
you ever seen that show cops?
i was watching it one time , and there was this cop on , and he was talkin 'about this gunfight he had in the hallway with this guy , right?
he just unloaded on this guy and nothin 'happened .
he didn't hit nothin '.
okay?
it was just him and this guy .
i mean , you know , it's , it's freaky , but it happens .
you wanna play blind man , go walk with the shepherd , but me , my eyes are wide fuckin 'open .
what the fuck does that mean?
it means that's it for me .
from here on in , you can consider my ass retired .
jesus christ .
goddamn it .
don t blaspheme .
i said , don't do that !
hey , why are you fuckin 'freakin 'out on us?
look , i'm tellin 'marsellus today i'm through .
why don't you tell him at the same time why?
don't worry , i will .
and i bet you $10, 000 he laughs his ass off .
i don't give a damn if he does .
marvin , what do you make of all this?
man , i don't even have an opinion .
you gotta have an opinion .
you think god came down from heaven and stopped
what the fuck's happenin '?
aw , shit , man !
aw , man !
oh , man , i shot marvin in the face .
why the fuck'd you do that?
i didn t mean it .
it was an accident .
man , i seen some crazy ass shit in my time , but this  chill out , man !
it was an accident .
we probably went over a bump or somethin '.
the car ain't hit no motherfuckin 'bump .
i didn t mean to shoot the son of a bitch .
the gun went off .
look at this fuckin 'mess !
we're on a city street in broad daylight here !
i don t believe it !
well , believe it now , motherfucker !
we gotta get this car off the road .
cops notice shit like a car drenched in blood .
just take it to a friendly place , that's all !
this is the valley , vincent .
marsellus ain't got no friendly places in the valley .
well , jules , this ain't my fuckin 'town , man !
shit !
what you doing?
i'm calling my partner in toluca lake .
where's toluca lake?
over the hill here , by burbank studios .
if jimmie's ass ain't home , i don t know what the fuck we gonna do ,
'cause i ain't got no other partners in 818 .
jimmie , how you doin ', man?
it's jules .
just listen up , man .
me and my homeboy are in a car , and we gotta get it off the road , pronto .
i need to use your garage for a couple hours .
we gotta be real fuckin 'delicate with this jimmie situation .
he's one remark away from kickin 'our asses out the door .
if he does , what do we do?
we ain't leavin ''til we make a couple calls , but i don't want it to reach that pitch jimmie's a friend .
you don't come into your friend's house and start tellin 'him what's what .
just tell him not to be abusive .
he kinda freaked outback there when he saw marvin .
put yourself in his position it's 8 : 00 in the morning , he just woke up .
he wasn't expectin 'this shit .
we gotta remember here who's doin 'who a favour .
if that favour means i gotta take shit , he can stick that favour straight up his ass .
fuck , nigger , what the fuck'd you just do to his towel , man?
i was dryin 'my hands !
you're supposed to wash 'em first !
you watched me wash 'em .
i watched you get'em wet .
i was washin ''em .
this shit's hard to get off .
maybe if he'd had lava i coulda done a better job .
i used the same fuckin 'soap you did , and when i finished , the towel didn t look like no goddamn maxi pad !
what if he was to come in here and see his towel like this?
it's shit like this that's gonna bring this situation to a head , man !
look , i ain't threatenin 'you or nothin ', all right?
you know i respect you and all .
but just don't put me in this position , all right?
all right .
fine .
fine .
ask me nice like that , no problem .
just go handle your friend .
go ahead .
i don't care .
mmm !
goddamn , jimmie !
this some serious gourmet shit .
me and vincent would've been satisfied ... with some freeze dried taster's choice .
right?
and he springs this serious gourmet shit on us .
what flavour is this?
knock it off , julie .
what?
i don t need you to tell me how fuckin 'good my coffee is .
i'm the one who buys it .
i know how good it is .
when bonnie goes shopping , she buys shit .
i buy the gourmet expensive stuff 'cause when i drink it , i wanna taste it .
but you know what's on my mind right now?
it ain't the coffee in my kitchen .
it's the dead nigger in my garage .
jimmie , don't even worry  don't tell me about anything .
i wanna ask you a question .
when you came pulling in here , did you notice the sign on the front of my house that said , " dead nigger storage "?
you know i ain't seen no  did you notice the sign on the front of my house ... that said , " dead nigger storage "?
no .
i didn't .
you know why you didn't see that sign?
why?
'cause it ain't there , 'cause storing dead niggers ain t my fuckin 'business , that's why !
we're not gonna store the motherfucker  don't you fuckin 'realize ... that if bonnie comes home and finds a dead body in her house , i'm gonna get divorced?
no marriage counsellor .
no trial separation .
i'm gonna get fuckin 'divorced .
okay?
and i don't wanna get fuckin 'divorced !
man , you know , fuck , i wanna help you , but i don't wanna lose my wife doin 'it .
jimmie , jimmie , she ain't gonna leave you .
don't fuckin '" jimmie " me , jules !
okay?
don't fuckin '" jimmie " me .
there's nothin 'you're gonna say that's gonna make me forget i love my wife .
is there?
now , look , you know , she comes home from work in about an hour and a half .
the graveyard shift at the hospital .
you gotta make some phone calls?
you gotta call some people?
well , then , do it , and then get the fuck out of my house before she gets here .
that's kool and the gang .
we don't wanna fuck your shit up .
all i wanna do is call my people and get'em to bring us in .
you're fucking my shit up right now !
you're gonna fuck my shit up big time if bonnie comes home .
do me that favour , all right?
the phone is in my bedroom .
i suggest you get going .
well , say she comes home .
what do you think she'll do?
oh , no fuckin 'shit she'll freak .
that ain t no kinda answer .
i mean , you know , i don't .
how much?
a lot or a little?
you got to appreciate what an explosive element ... this bonnie situation is .
she comes home from a hard day's work , finds a bunch of gangsters in her kitchen ... doing a bunch of gangster shit , there ain t no tellin 'what she's liable to do .
yeah , i grasp that , jules .
all i'm doing is contemplating the ifs .
i don't wanna hear about no motherfuckin 'ifs !
all i want to hear from your ass is , " you ain't got no problem , jules .
i'm on the motherfucker .
chill them niggers out and wait for the cavalry , which should be coming directly .
you ain't got no problem , jules .
i'm on the motherfucker .
chill them niggers out and wait for the wolf , who should be coming directly .
you sendin 'the wolf?
oh , you feel better , motherfucker?
shit , yeah , negro !
that's all you had to say ! ## [ piano ]
she the hysterical type?
when is she due?
mm hmm .
give me the principals 'names again .
place your bets .
jules .
mm hmm .
cards , please .
vincent .
jimmie .
bonnie .
mm hmm .
it's thirty minutes away .
i'll be there in ten .
you're ...
jimmie , right?
this is your house?
it sure is .
i'm winston wolf .
i solve problems .
good .
we got one .
so i heard .
may i come in?
uh , yeah .
please do .
you must be jules .
which would make you ...
vincent .
let's get down to brass tacks , gentlemen .
if i was informed correctly , the clock is ticking .
is that right , jimmie?
uh , one hundred percent .
your wife bonnie comes home at 9 : 30 in the a . m . , correct?
uh huh .
i was led to believe if she comes home and finds us here , she wouldn't appreciate it much .
she wouldn't at that .
that gives us 40 minutes to get the fuck outta dodge , which , if you do what i say , when i say it , should be plenty .
now , you got a corpse in a car , minus a head , in a garage .
take me to it .
jimmie .
uh huh .
do me a favour , will ya?
thought i smelled some coffee back there .
would you make me a cup?
uh , yeah , sure .
oh , uh , um , how do you take it?
lotsa cream , lotsa sugar .
about the car , is there anything i need to know?
does it stall?
does it smoke?
does it make a lot of noise?
is there gas in it?
aside from how it looks , the car's cool .
positive?
don't get me on the road and i find out the brake lights don't work .
as far as i know , the motherfucker's tip top .
good enough .
let's go back to the kitchen .
here you go , mr wolf .
thank you , jimmie .
mmm .
okay , first thing .
you two .
take the body , stick it in the trunk .
this looks to be a pretty domesticated house .
that would lead me to believe you got cleansers and shit .
yeah .
under the sink .
good .
what i need you two fellas to do is take those cleaning products ... and clean the inside of the car i'm talkin 'fast , fast , fast .
go in the back seat , scoop up all those little pieces of brain and skull .
get it out of there .
wipe down the upholstery .
it don t need to be spick and span .
you don t need to eat off it .
just give it a good once over .
what you need to take care of are the really messy parts .
the pools of blood that have collected , you gotta soak that shit up .
we need to raid your linen closet .
i need blankets , i need comforters , quilts , bedspreads .
the thicker the better , the darker the better .
no whites .
can't use 'em .
we'll need to camouflage the front seat and back seat and floorboards ... with quilts and blankets , so if a cop starts stickin 'his big snout in the car , the subterfuge won t last , but at a glance the car will appear to be normal .
jimmie , lead the way .
boys , get to work .
please " would be nice .
come again?
i said , a " please " would be nice .
get it straight , buster .
i'm not here to say please .
i'm here to tell you what to do .
and if self preservation is an instinct you possess , you'd better fuckin 'do it and do it quick .
i'm here to help .
if my help's not appreciated , lotsa luck , gentlemen .
no , mr wolf , it ain't like that ; your help is definitely appreciated .
mr wolf , listen .
i don't mean disrespect , okay?
i respect you .
i just don t like people barkin 'orders at me .
if i'm curt with you , it's because time is a factor .
i think fast , i talk fast , and i need you guys to act fast if you wanna get out of this .
so pretty please , with sugar on top , clean the fuckin 'car .
don t be lookin 'at me like that , all right?
i can feel your look .
it's a 1974 chevy nova .
green .
nothin 'except for the mess inside .
mmm , about20 minutes .
nobody who'll be missed .
you're a good man , joe .
thanks a bunch .
how we comin ', jimmie?
pretty good .
i got it all here , but , uh , [ sighs ]
mr wolf , you gotta understand something .
winston , jimmie , winston .
okay .
you gotta understand something , uh , winston .
uh uh , no , thank you .
uh , this is our best linen here , and it's , uh it was a wedding present ... from my uncle conrad and my aunt ginny .
they're not with us any more .
i wanna help  let me ask you a question .
if you don t mind .
no , no , please .
go ahead .
your uncle conrad and aunt ginny , were they millionaires?
no .
well , your uncle marsellus is .
and i'm positive that if uncle conrad and aunt ...
ginny .
ginny were here , they would furnish you with a whole bedroom set , which your uncle marsellus is more than happy to do .
i like oak myself .
that's what i have in my bedroom .
how about you , jimmie?
you an oak man?
oak's nice .
oh , man , i will never forgive your ass for this shit .
this is some fucked up , repugnant shit .
jules , did you ever hear the philosophy that once a man admits he is wrong ... that he is immediately forgiven for all wrongdoings?
get the fuck out my face with that shit !
the motherfucker that said that shit never had to pick up itty bitty pieces of skull ...
on account of your dumb ass .
i got a threshold , jules , for the abuse that i will take .
right now , i'm a fuckin 'race car , and you got me in the red .
i'm just sayin 'it's fuckin 'dangerous to have a race car in the fuckin 'red .
that's all .
i could blow .
oh , you ready to blow?
yeah .
well , i'm a mushroom cloud layin 'motherfucker , motherfucker .
every time my fingers touch brain , i'm superfly t. n. t.
i'm the guns of the navarone .
in fact , what the fuck am i doin 'in the back?
you're the motherfucker should be on brain detail !
we're fuckin 'switchin '.
i'm washin 'windows , and you're pickin 'up this nigger's skull !
fine job , gentlemen .
you may get out of this yet .
i can t believe this is the same car .
well , let's not start suckin 'each other's dicks quite yet .
clean you two .
strip .
all the way?
to your bare ass .
quickly , gentlemen .
we got about 15 minutes ... before jimmie's better half comes pulling into the driveway .
goddamn , this morning air is some chilly shit .
are you sure this is absolutely necessary?
you know what you two look like?
what?
like a couple of guys who just blew off somebody's head .
strippin 'off those bloody rags is absolutely necessary .
toss 'em in jimmie's garbage bag .
don't do nothin 'stupid , like leavin 'this shit out front for the garbage man to pick up .
don't worry , we're taking it with us .
jim , the soap .
vincent .

ha ha ha .
they're your clothes , motherfucker .
come on , gentlemen .
we're laughing our way right into prison .
don t make me beg .
okay , gentlemen , let's get our rules of the road straight .
we're going to a place called monster joe's truck and tow .
monster joe and his daughter raquel are sympathetic to our dilemma .
the place is north hollywood , so a few twists and turns aside , we'll be goin 'up hollywood way .
now , i'll drive the tainted car .
jules , you ride with me .
vincent , you follow in my acura .
now , if we come across the path of any john q. laws ,
nobody does a fuckin 'thing 'til i do something .
right .
what did i say?
don't do shit unless .
unless what?
unless you do it first .
spoken like a true prodigy .
how about you , lash larue?
can you keep your spurs from jingling and jangling?
the gun went off .
i don t know why .
i'm cool .
i promise you .
fair enough .
now , i drive real fuckin 'fast , so keep up .
if get my car back any different than i gave it ,
monster joe's gonna be disposing of two bodies .
outta my way , rex .
we cool?
like it never happened .
all right .
boys , this is raquel .
someday all this will be hers .
hi .
so , what's with the outfits?
you guys going to a volleyball game or something?
i'm takin 'milady out for breakfast .
maybe i could drop you two off .
where do you live?
redondo .
inglewood .
it's it's your future . l
i see a a cab ride .
move outta the sticks , fellas .
say good night , raquel .
good night , raquel .
i'll see you guys around .
stay outta trouble , you crazy kids .
mr wolf , i just wanna tell you it was a real pleasure watching you work .
yeah , really .
and thank you very much , mr wolf .
call me winston .
you see that , young lady?
respect .
respect for one's elders shows character .
i have character .
because you are a character doesn t mean that you have character .
wanna share a cab?
i'd go for some breakfast .
feel like havin 'breakfast with me?
cool .
i don t know why , i just thought he'd be european or something .
yeah , he's about as european as fuckin 'english bob .
i know that now .
but was he cool or what?
thank you .
totally fuckin 'cool , in control .
didn't even really get pissed when you were fuckin 'with him ; i was amazed .
want some bacon?
no , man , i don't eat pork .
are you jewish?
i ain't jewish ; i just don't dig on swine , that's all .
why not?
pigs are filthy animals .
i don't eat filthy animals .
yeah , but bacon tastes good .
pork chops taste good .
sewer rat may taste like pumpkin pie , but i'd never know ...
'cause i wouldn't eat the filthy motherfuckers .
pigs sleep and root in shit .
that's a filthy animal .
i ain't eatin 'nothin 'ain't got sense enough to disregard its own faeces .
what about a dog?
dog eats its own faeces .
i don't eat dog either .
yeah , but do you consider a dog to be a filthy animal?
i wouldn't go so far as to call a dog filthy , but they're definitely dirty .
but a dog's got personality .
personality goes a long way .
ah , so , by that rationale , if a pig had a better personality , he would cease to be a filthy animal .
is that true?
we'd have to be talkin 'about one charming motherfuckin 'pig .
i mean , he'd have to be ten times more charming than that arnold on green acres .
oh , man , that's good .
that's good , man .
you're startin 'to lighten up .
you've been sittin 'there , all serious and shit .
i just been sittin 'here , thinkin '.
about what?
about the miracle we witnessed .
miracle you witnessed .
i witnessed a freak occurrence .
what is a miracle , vincent?
act of god .
and what's an act of god?
when , um , god makes the impossible possible .
but this morning ...
i don't think qualifies .
hey , vincent .
see , that shit don t matter .
you're judging this shit the wrong way .
it could be god stopped the bullets , changed coke to pepsi , found my car keys .
you don't judge shit like this based on merit .
now , whether or not what we experienced ... was an according to hoyle miracle is insignificant .
but what is significant is , i felt the touch of god .
god got involved .
but why?
i don t know why .
but i can't go back to sleep .
you're serious .
you're really thinkin 'about quittin '.
for life?
most definitely .
yeah .
fuck .
what you gonna do then?
well , that's what i been sitting here contemplating .
first i'm gonna deliver this case to marsellus .
then , basically , i'm just gonna walk the earth .
what you mean , " walk the earth "?
like caine in kung fu .
walk from place to place , meet people , get in adventures .
and how long do you intend to walk the earth?
'til god puts me where he wants me to be .
what if he don't do that?
if it takes forever , then i'll walk forever .
so you decided to be a bum .
i'll just be jules , vincent .
no more , no less .
no , jules , you decided to be a bum , just like all those pieces of shit out there who beg for change , who sleep in garbage bins , eat what i throw away .
they got a name for that , jules .
it's called a bum .
and without a job , a residence or legal tender , that's what you're gonna be , man .
you're gonna be a fuckin 'bum .
look , my friend , this is just where you and i differ .
garon !
coffee !
jules , look , what happened this morning , man , i agree it was peculiar .
but water into wine , l  all shapes and sizes , vincent .
don't fuckin 'talk to me that way , man .
if my answers frighten you , then you should cease asking scary questions .
i'm gonna take a shit .
let me ask you something .
when did you make this decision?
when you were sittin 'there eatin 'that muffin?
yeah .
i was sittin 'here eatin 'my muffin , drinkin 'my coffee , replayin 'the incident in my head , when i had what alcoholics refer to as a moment of clarity .

and when you do it , you do it cool .
you ready?
one , two , three .
okay , now you let him go !
yolanda !
i thought you were gonna be cool .
now , when you yell at me , it makes me nervous .
when i get nervous , i get scared .
when motherfuckers get scared , that's when motherfuckers accidentally get shot .
just know , you hurt him , you die .
well , that seems to be the situation .
but i don't want that .
and you don't want that .
and ringo here definitely doesn't want that .
so let's see what we can do .
now ... here's the situation .
normally both your asses would be dead as fuckin 'fried chicken , but you happened to pull this shit while i'm in a transitional period , and i don't wanna kill you ; i wanna help you .
but i can't give you this case , 'cause it don t belong to me .
besides , i been through too much shit over this case this morning ... to just hand it over to your dumb ass .
vincent !
be cool !
yolanda , it's cool , baby .
get back !
it's cool !
we still just talkin '.
come on .
point the gun at me .
point the gun at me .
there you go .
now , vincent , you just hang back ... and don't do a goddamn thing .
tell her it's still cool .
it's still cool , honey bunny .
how we doin ', baby?
l i gotta go pee .
i wanna go home .
hang in there , baby .
i'm proud of you .
and ringo's proud of you .
it's almost over .
tell her you're proud of her .
i'm proud of you , honey bunny .
i love you .
i love you too , honey bunny .
now ,
i want you to go in that bag and find my wallet .
which one is it?
it's the one that says " bad motherfucker .
that's it .
that's my bad motherfucker .
open it up .
take out the money .
count it .
how much is there?
about 1, 500 dollars .
okay , put it in your pocket .
it's yours .
now , with the rest of those wallets and the register , that makes this a pretty successful little score , huh?
jules , you give that fuckin 'nimrod 1, 500 dollars , and i'll shoot him on general principle .
no , yolanda !
yolanda !
he ain't gonna do a goddamn , motherfuckin 'thing !
vince , shut the fuck up !
shut up !
come on , yolanda .
stay with me , baby .
now , i ain't givin 'it to him , vincent .
i'm buyin 'something for my money .
wanna know what i m buyin ', ringo?
what?
your life .
i'm givin 'you that money so i don t have to kill your ass .
you read the bible , ringo?
not regularly , no .
well , there's this passage i got memorized .
ezekiel 25 : 17 .
the path of the righteous man is beset on all sides ... by the inequities of the selfish ... and the tyranny of evil men .
blessed is he who , in the name of charity and good will , shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness , for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children .
and i will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger ... those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers .
and you will know i am the lord ... when i lay my vengeance upon you .
i been sayin 'that shit for years , and if you heard it , that meant your ass .
i never gave much thought to what it meant .
i just thought it was some cold blooded shit to say to a motherfucker ... before i popped a cap in his ass .
but i saw some shit this morning made me think twice .
see , now i'm thinkin 'maybe it means ... you're the evil man , and i'm the righteous man , and mr 9 millimetre here , he's the shepherd ... protecting my righteous ass in the valley of darkness .
or it could mean ... you're the righteous man , and i'm the shepherd , and it's the world that's evil and selfish .
now , i'd like that .
but that shit ain't the truth .
the truth is , you're the weak ... and i'm the tyranny of evil men .
but i m tryin ', ringo .
i'm tryin 'real hard ... to be the shepherd .
go .
i think we should be leaving now . ## [ " surf rider " ]
yeah , that's probably a good idea .
