the trouble with humor is that people think you must be joking
today , " tales of the swedish countryside "
takes us to the swirling rivers of the province of dalecarlia .
where able bodied men float lumber , the gold of the woods .
this is a job for real men !

good morning , mr dahlgren .
good morning .
how was your bowel movement?
it was nice and firm .
have you slept well , gudrun?
no , i have a terrible headache .
those are withdrawal symptoms due to a lack of coffee .
don't forget our meeting .
there are only two guests this week , and you know what that means .
either we go bankrupt , or we'll have to go with the times .
we also need a new name .
something with a modern ring to it .
well , the name was good enough for dad .
we must be doing something wrong , we don't have enough guests .
the new granhedsgrden "?
kulla grden changed its name like that .
the health farm
this movie is based on countless eye popping headlines
somewhere in scotland

thou free ranging chicken thou star of the north
thou tender , thou tasty and delightful
grace your table with a svea broiler " .
svea broiler , the swedish speciality .
how do you get blue chickens?
in the computer .
everything's digital .
we'll pan in and out , and add landscaping
and more chickens , if necessary .
that sounds expensive .
we're talking about an additional 300, 000 to 400, 000 .
for extra editing procedures .
can we really afford an ad campaign for three million kronor?
bold moves for desperate times .
i hope you know what you're doing .
were they in mourning?
they wore black .
no , that's the way admen dress nowadays .
the tokyo market was up three percent .
while frankfurt was down 2, 3 % .
here's your laundry .
hello , ma .
what are we going to do with you , stig helmer?
you can't stay glued to the tv like some kind of couch potato .
just look at you , you used to be so slim .
you should join " the poundhunters " .
elsa lost 15 kilos , you know .
your fingers are all yellow , have you started smoking?
that's from the snacks .
all that junk ...
the stockholm market took a dive today ...
why are you watching this?
the remote control is broken .
i'll do the vacuuming next week , but please pick the place up a bit .
she wasn't really right for you .
bye , take care .
hi !
could you possibly give me a hand?
i'd like to rearrange some stuff .
sure .
do you have a cat?
a cat?
no ...
i thought i heard a cat in distress .
maybe the sound came from upstairs .
i don't think it's right to keep cats in town .
this is how i live .
it's nice .
what's that?
whales .
i like to meditate to their songs .
hear the heartbeat ...
it's the sound you heard in the womb .
please give me a hand with the bed .
there's some negative energy over here .
have you heard of feng shui?
it's about fields of energy , ley lines .
help pull the bed over here a bit .
that's fine .
no , it doesn't feel right .
there's too much sha qi from that corner ...
east ...
no , it's in conflict with my kuan number .
let's have another go at it .
pull it towards you .
be careful , now .
this feels good ...
it'll work if i put a bagua in the corner .
what's your sign?
no , don't tell me ...
you're a taurus , aren't you?
you move like a taurus .
what date?
may 5th .
the fifth day of the fifth month , what a surprise !
that means you're a romantic that likes to be in the spotlight .
i don't know about that ...
thanks , please accept a photograph of your aura .
put your hand right there .
i'm going to take a picture of your aura , your magnetic field .
say cheese !
i was only kidding .
that's weird , you hardly have an aura at all .
your chakras appear to be out of harmony .
your sahasra seems to be blocked .
your crown chakra ...
and you blinked .
are you sad about something?
i'm not exactly happy ...
you should consider therapy .
i don't know about that ...
think about it .
i could be your coach .
i could be your personal guidance counselor .
the poundhunters 71 kilos .
wow , you've lost 8 kilos !
that's fantastic !
could you tell us your secret?
my mother's been visiting for two weeks now , and she thinks i'm fat
so she nags me a lot , and i clean house to blow off steam .
i guess cleaning is good exercise .
camilla .
77 kilos .
you've gained two kilos .
invite your mother to stay !
how was it?
embarassing .
everyone seems to lose weight but me .
it's expensive too 4, 000 kronor !
for that you get weighed in public every two weeks
and you get a skimpy booklet of diet tips .
for 2, 000 you can weigh yourself alone at my place .
i'm going to quit " the poundhunters " and start dieting for real .
70 kilos?
it must be a slow news day .
some ley lines ...
a pinch of sha qi ... ... and some negative energy ...
some feng shui ...
a splash of therapy ...
and the singing of the whales ...
hello , i brought you something to cheer you up .
here , it's the very latest thing .
you punch in the numbers here .
1 . 9 meters .
sex : male , right?
just step right up .
on that thing?
your weight is 102 kilos , your body mass index is 28 .
recommended dietary intake 6 7 megajoules if sendentary .
10 megajoules if active .
have a nice day .
great , isn't it?
and if it doesn't behave itself , just remove the batteries .
found yourself a job yet?
no , i'm too old ...
too old?
don't give up !
like i've always said , life is full of possibilities .
you're a man in the prime of life .
you're just a trifle too pregnant , that's all .
is this what you had in mind?
i had pictured something a bit more humoristic .
oh ...
what should we try then?
how about this?
not bad ...
do you have chicken suits?
yes , this way .
would you prefer the kind with an eggshell hat?
they're very popular .
no , thank you .
cowls or just beaks?
cowls , please .
how about accessories?
like an egg basket that squeaks?
or an inflatable cock's comb?
hi there , ole .
hi there , stig helmer .
i hope these will do .
they're great .
perfect ...
okay , you guys , put the costumes on .
phat !
your jacket's phat .
is it vintage?
you know old .
i bought it in 1970 .
it's so happening .
take a look .
we did a spread for wallpaper yesterday .
you've always been a happening guy .
thou free ranging chicken , thou star of the north
cut !
you're standing too close together .
" svea broiler " , take 11 .
playback .
the mike is showing .
take 37 .
one hen per 10 square meters .
we're finished .
damned european union ...
pretty soon every chicken will be entitled to its own bathroom .
the danes have dumped the price of broilers .
no ...
this won't do ...
we're history .
andwe just bought two tons of chicken feed , too .
maybe we should accept that ridiculous danish bid .
or go into receivership .
go bust?
i'd rather go to hell .
i've got to cancel our commercial with that norwegian guy .
what insurance do we have?
full coverage .
why do you ask?
in case something should happen .
it's nice to get away from the rat race , isn't it?
hi , roger .
go ahead and torture me .
you're late .
are you very busy?
yeah , with a tricky commercial .
let's get started on our regular program .
good work , ole .
slow down on your way back and bend your elbows .
like this?
perfect .
sorry about that , it's my cell phone .
bramserud advertising .
what?
you don't ...
all right .
okay ...
well , no more tricky commercial ...
damn !
what is it?
my arm is going numb .
that's not good .
my friend's a cardiologist .
what's that?
a heart specialist .
i'm ole bramserud .
i'm nurse kristian .
you'll find doctor westerberg over there .
ole bramserud .
karin westerberg .
you're not swedish , are you?
your situation isn't serious .
but you are burning yourself out .
that's trendy .
you're no longer in your 20s .
slow down a bit , both with regard to work and work outs .
take walks instead , take a week off and pamper yourself .
i won't need a walker?
i've fried you a chicken .
don't mention the creatures !
the broiler factory's giving us trouble .
i'm sorry to hear that .
what's that?
i'm dieting .
what is it this time , the pineapple diet?
the stewardess method?
your phone calls last longer than your diets !
that stuff smells like our chicken feed .
how much do they charge for it?
590 kronor .
do you know how much it costs to manufacture it?
2 or 3 kronor , tops !
590 kronor ...
for accurate readings , both feet must be placed on scales .
body mass index 14 .
you have lost 49 kilos .
congratulations .
you weigh 142 kilos .
your body mass index , body mass index ...
hands up !
what are you doing?
why are you waving a golf club?
i thought you were a burglar .
someone broke into the lundin's place last week .
aren't you supposed to eat regularly?
and shouldn't you avoid drinking concentrated sauces?
that stuff's supposed to be diluted .
bruno , what should i do?
i can't handle this any more .
go somewhere , try a week at a spa .
either that , or we'll just have to buy a fridge with a time lock .
good night .
lift your feet up .
therapy?
well , i never !
throwing out good money on therapy when you're unemployed .
no one in our family has ever done anything like that .
a rest home !
it's a spa , ma .
what's the difference?
i bet that norwegian friend of yours is behind this .
oh no ...
the vacuum cleaner's clogged with cheese oodles again .
they're called " cheese doodles " , ma .
i'll be back at three .
what should i do with these?
send them back to anderhage .
don't even mention the word 'chicken 'in the future .
i won't , boss .
that feels better .
are you going to the new age fair?
i'll be working at granhedsgrden .
peeling carrots?
no , they're making the place over .
they're offering a specialty week called " the whole person " .
how much do i owe you?
625 plus tax .
do you accept credit cards?
of course .
do you like your new place?
the vibes are good .
how are the neighbors?
one's coming along to the spa .
someone sorely in need of therapy .
is she?
is he?
he's a bulimic mommy's boy .
the silent type .
out of touch with his feelings .
i'm going to coach him .
it's going to be challenging .
it's my pleasure to welcome dr levander .
i'm sure you're familiar with his tv shows and books
like " eating the right way " or " i can fly " .
they'll be on sale at the desk .
please go ahead .
thank you , ulla .
right now , the trend in holistic medicine is specialty weeks .
the idea is to offer package deals to massage the soul .
modern people want more than just a plate full of raw vegetables .
that is why i made this list
of activities that should be available at a modern spa .
the first heading is stress management
with activities such as basic yoga , tai chi , qi gong
circulation massage , rebirthing , rosen therapy
shiatsu therapy and sacred dancing .
the next heading is fitness .
this includes aerobics , step up , spinning
aqua aerobics , mantric jogging , mud packs and aromatherapy .
a new feature is underwater speakers
that play the song of the dolphins .
cosmology and mentalism
heart walks , walking on hot coals and survival courses .
another new feature is that guests may bring their pets along
to meet a dietician or a psychologist .
the canine jacuzzi is very popular .
last , but not least , we come to the menu .
our target group expects something fancier than grated carrots .
we get it .
any questions?
ping pong yoga ...
quiet , nisse !
that's qi gong .
their special package deal is called " the whole person " .
but you want to return half as big , right?
should we give it a try , you think?
yes , you need to diet .
and i need to take it easy .
5, 000 kronor .
7, 000 kronor .
i don't mean to offend you , but why don't you go for the fast?
aren't you going to fast?
nope , doctor's orders .
i need to consume more fat .
i have some kind of scurvy in reverse .
the next time i see my dietician , i'll slug him with a pork loin .
but now it's time for dessert .
it may be the last one we ever see .
what are you doing?
scraping my tongue .
it's supposed to make your breath sweeter , in case you ever get kissed .
you fall for everything .
i read about it in a magazine .
i bought you this .
what is it?
a potency patch?
it enhances potency .
where do they go , over your eyes?
that wasn't very nice !
take a look at yourself .
exciting , huh?
by the way , i did your horoscope .
don't make any crucial business decisions this month .
what a load of crap !
are we living in the dark ages?
lots of major companies consult astrologers before making decisions .
suit yourself .
good night .
kissy , kissy !
let's slow down a bit .
and then pick up the tempo .
and slow down again .
changing pace like this in intervals
improves your stamina and helps burn more fat .
we do have a regular bike , and the area is very scenic .
i thought we weren't going to discuss this any more .
by the way , claes and i are going to fly over to the broiler factory .
will you be home for dinner?
i'll let you know .
don't pull anything , like you did with that rowing machine .
you know i don't like flying .
you should see somebody , try dr levander .
flying's safer than driving , and i need to rack up mileage .
i have something to show you .
i have a brilliant idea .
this is my idea .
did you drag me all the way over here to show me chicken feed?
you're looking at five million kronor .
what do you mean?
i'll tell you .
swedes are getting fat from stuffing their faces with potato chips .
that's when it hit me ...
diet chips .
diet chips?
people can eat all the chips they want , without the guilt .
what are these chips made out of?
the two tons of chicken feed left over from our broiler factory .
the factory we're going to unload .
each bag costs 75 kronor , and that amounts to ... ... a profit of 9 , 925 kronor per bag .
how do we get people to eat it?
people eat anything .
we threw a party when i was in college .
we served bowls of " doggy delight " and people gobbled it up .
" doggy delight "?
dog food , the dried variety .
it's nothing but a scam , that's illegal .
no , it isn't .
i had the crap camilla bought analyzed , and it's the same stuff .
it consists of the by products of fish and some minerals and vitamins .
it's absolutely brilliant , isn't it?
welcome to the health food business !
what will people think about this hocus pocus?
and dragging city folks into the wild for survival training? !
i don't think so , ulla .
it stinks !
just look here .
our new ad
has booked us solid for four weeks .
let people talk !
you take care of the kitchen and i'll take care of the rest .
well , what if dad had lived to see this?
well , dad ...
i hope they serve linseeds and bran in heaven .
give my best to camilla .
inger ...
do you think you could persuade camilla to go to a fat farm?
she's desperate .
i'll give her a call .
the chips ought to contain something japanese , like seaweed .
and a fat blocker , too .
it's all the rage .
focus your energy on the factory , before it ruins us .
never fear !
don't shed a tear , my dear for my sake ...
here .
it's almost time .
what the hell ...?
i thought this was settled , it will give us publicity .
the two top local papers will both be there !
don't be such a stick in the mud .
stop it !
this display of initiative by ulla lundgren
has created jobs and put our town on the map ... ... the true spirit of enterprise that our region needs .
the gustav vasa spa is now open to the public .
let's go for some patterning .
stick your index finger into the first hole in the dial .
take a deep breath
i'm safe in the air " .
i'm safe in the air .
move your finger to the next hole
and repeat the affirmation .
i'm safe in the air .
do this twice a day , preferably in conjunction with meditation .
meditation?
i'm not into spacey stuff like that .
just find a quiet moment .
how's business?
we're having some ups and downs .
we got stuck with a broiler factory that isn't going well at all .
but now we're in the health food business .
what about you?
i can't complain .
there are phobics , hypochondriacs and people obsessed with their looks .
there's no shortage of people in trouble .
bruno and i would like to discuss collaborating with you .
guess what?
i bought a pair of rubber pants .
are you going to take up diving?
no , it's to combat cellulite .
what does bruno think about that?
we don't share a bed any more .
he says that i snore .
that you snore?
men !
i'm glad you're going to the spa .
it's going to be interesting .
but in my opinion , bruno and claes should be the ones to go .
overweight men are time bombs .
don't say that !
bruno says the only exercise he gets
is being a pallbearer at funerals for his fitness freak friends .
he doesn't want to be in good shape when he dies .
well?
slim quick " ...
who developed it?
experts .
has it been tested?
yes .
it's been tested extensively on animals .
diet chips ...
it sounds interesting ...
vegans in chlcken sults rald meat transport van
amazing ...
some militant vegans have attacked another meat shipment .
according to witnesses , they were dressed in chicken suits .
you're lucky nothing like that has happened to you .
chickens !
what about your vitamins?
i'll take them later .
have a nice time at the gustav vasa spa .
give my best to inger .
i would have taken you there in my plane
but i've got a lot of stuff cooking .
that's right , chicken suits .
just like our commercial .
isn't that something?
i'm on my way .
95 % of sweden must be woodlands .
you sure have a lot of gadgets .
a compass , a thermometer ... ... a gage for inclines and one for altitude , and a clock .
air conditioning , a radio , a gps navigation system ...
and according to its reading , we are close to brnnforsen .
yes , i know .
how?
i read the sign over there .
signs are for cheaters , stig helmer .
the gustav vasa spa ...
let the torture commence .
hello , stig helmer .
hi , i'm rebecka .
i'm ole .
did you have a nice trip?
i got a bit car sick ...
it's probably psychosomatic .
we'll cure you .
see you later .
therapy , you say?
lucky you .
i always overpack .
that's not excessive .
this is just my small suitcase .
what a beautiful place !
not to mention expensive .
we could have gone to barbados .
he's a food smuggler .
how can you tell?
i know the type .
remember the guy who brought roast beef in his dressing case?
someone even stored pancakes in a container for face cream .
it's incredible !
i'm ulla , and i'd like to welcome you to the gustav vasa spa .
we'll start by introducing the staff .
anna teaches classes in sacred dance , tai chi and qi gong .
rebecka is our shihatsu therapist .
and rainbow is our vegetarian chef .
linda is our dietician , and composed the drink you have received .
and my brother nils is a jack of all trades .
we have a few house rules .
this is a drug free environment .
toxic substances such as alcohol , nicotine and caffeine are off limits .
we promote life , not death .
fasting gives you bad body odor .
your body is cleansing itself .
for others , the increased intake of roughage may give you gas .
this is because your body is accustomed to eating dead animals .
this discomfort is reduced by daily colonic irrigation .
purchase your own personal nozzle at the desk .
write your name on it so it won't get lost .
or stolen .
back down onto the nozzle ...
and then you just turn on the hose .
one last thing , please turn off your cell phones .
it's pretty warm ...
it's nice .
just so we get acquainted
i'd like us to take each other by the hand and sing a song .
that's silly , it's not like this is kindergarden .
it's just a way of getting to know each other , ke .
rest in peace , dear calorie
soon you will be eaten
hidden deep inside of us
digested and forgotten
it's like being able to print your own money .
i'm a genius .
we used to only serve grated , raw vegetables .
rainbow has written a cookbook .
" esoteric cuisine " .
so dad's book isn't good enough anymore?
did your dad write cookbooks too?
the recipes are very orthodox .
gut feeling " ...
stocks in high risk projects in the former east bloc ... ... belong down the drain .
that's all for tonight , we'll be back in two weeks .
we'll be taking a critical look at diet aids
and how the obese are taken advantage of .
the " diet king " will be featured .
he made millions selling useless pills to overweight swedes .
thanks ...
i should have put more pressure on that stock broker .
he's pretty slippery .
diet chips ...
that guy has been irritating me for quite some time .
find the manufacturer and analyze the ingredients .
i'm a bit sceptical about these kinds of places .
are you a believer?
a believer?
do you believe in crystal therapy and horoscopes?
no , but it's fun to see what places like this are all about .
i came here to take it easy .
to rest .
my friend was going to stay here , so i decided to tag along .
what do you do when you're not keeping friends company?
i own a small outfit ... an advertising agency .
bramserud advertising .
bramserud , that's me .
my name is inger .
i'm considering retirement , though ...
leaving the rat race , reading some of the books i've bought .
maybe even take bracing walks .
my ex started taking ten kilometer walks when he turned 40 .
and that was the last anyone ever saw of him .
are you married?
not that i recall .
possibly married to my work , but we're getting a divorce .
what about you?
i'm unmarried ... at the moment .
good morning .
that looks yummy .
what is it?
a decoction of broccoli .
the new italian cuisine , huh?
what's this key gong stuff?
it's qi gong .
it's a chinese form of gymnastics , like karate in slow motion .
there was an emperor who outlawed martial arts
and somebody figured that they could do the same motions slowly .
off with your head !
i'm gouging your eyes out .
karate for snails .
if you practise for years , you can use your hands and feet
to make incredibly bad movies .
have you seen rainbow?
i think he went ... ... that way .
i think he's in the vegetable garden .
we live in a universal force field .
it can be measured with a squld .
a squid?
a super conducting quantum interference device .
your aura is a force field and , as such , attracts energy .
at times , we need to recharge our batteries .
hugging a tree will do the trick .
trees willingly share their energy with us .
if you feel embarrased , stand with your back to the tree .
how exciting !
in your mind , greet the tree .
picture yourself inside the tree .
feel its roots .
what the hell ...?
feel how the tree gets energy from the sun .
no way ...
tree hugging !
well , it's better than nothing .
it's actually kind of nice .
give me a hug , stig helmer !
hug me !
let's have our first therapy session this afternoon .
don't wear heavy clothing .
i won't .
oh , ole and i were going to take a hungarian mud bath .
then we'll have our session after that .
don't forget to take a shower after the mud bath .
there you go .
thanks .
you have dandruff .
i'll prepare a conditioner with lavender and eucalyptus .
i'll also stimulate the acupressure points on the scalp
which counteracts baldness in the future .
slices of biodynamic cucumber
flush out toxins and remove wrinkles .
there we go .
relax completely .
i'm going to leave you for awhile .
make the most out of this session and exercise your pelvic floor .
okay , boss .
i feel like a sandwich .
rebecka's pretty cute ... ... for a witch .
she looks more like an imp .
tell me about your childhood .
what was your father like?
like most other dads .
but that isn't quite true , he was ...
he had a handicap .
in what way?
he only had one arm .
the olsson brothers dixie jazz band " .
henry played the saxophone and my dad was the drummer .
even though he only had one arm?
it worked pretty well .
but he couldn't do drum rolls .
that's understandable .
he invented a gadget .
you're repressed .
your body stores these conflicts and makes you tense .
unexpressed grief and anger turn into a muscular coat of armor .
you really need to release some of that aggression .
just lay down , like that .
and lift your arms up like this .
what's this?
i want you to try to push me away .
i'll hold on tight and i want you to push me away .
here we go ...
come on .
no ...
come on , give it a go .
there's some broccoli stuck in your mustache .
come on !
stop it !
say you're a wimp !
come on , say you're a wimp !
look , stig helmer's getting licked by a girl !
you're the wimp !
what's that?
nothing , i guess ...
that felt good .
good .
the energy is good .
there's a lot of aggression bottled up inside you .
you're an unusual man , stig helmer .
you're an only child , aren't you?
did you play ball with the kids in the neighborhood?
yes , but i wasn't very good .
if you're going to be a goalpost , you can't move around .
how does it feel to fast?
i feel a bit dizzy .
that's because of the toxins that are being eliminated .
i bet you ate a lot of junk food .
hot dogs , and stuff like that .
last night i had the strangest dream .
i'm ole , the king sized hot dog !
eat me if you dare !
i'm so wonderfully greasy ...
eat me !
you shouldn't eat anything that has eyes and can bear young .
i never thought of it that way .
you're a vegetarian then?
no , a fruitarian .
fruitarian?
i only eat fruit .
the richest food i eat is bananas .
but i don't eat bananas either , for other reasons .
you know , because of united fruit and pesticides .
it's so beautiful here ...
it is .
evenings like this make me long to be back in norrland .
what city are you from up north?
hrnsand .
those aqua gymnastics wore me out .
are you going to iron?
what a busy bee !
what's that?
wait and see .
presto espresso !
great !
i was dying for some coffee .
right , enough is enough .
that norwegian guy seems very nice .
what , are you dumping the survival course instructor unseen?
i don't know ...
bruno's on the phone all the time .
he and claes are up to something .
did you know that the yanks spend 30 times more a year on dieting
than the un spends on fighting starvation .
how's our project going?
brilliantly !
30, 000 packages .
have you given any thought to my radical solution for the factory?
yes .
in my opinion , you're short on morals and long on imagination .
what of it?
it's against the law !
you have to help , you're in as deep as me .
wimp !
yes .
could you go pick the guru up?
he's arriving on the two o'clock train .
what does he look like?
oriental , i suppose .
right , six feet tall and blond .
what do i know?
make a sign and hold it up .
i wonder if it's ball room dancing?
hardly .
do you like to dance?
i was the fred astaire of oslo some 15 to 20 kilos ago .
do you?
yes , if i get to pick my partner .
i don't like it when strange men fondle me like it was their right .
but i can always make an exception ...
this is going to be interesting .
ginger rogers must have been a better dancer than astaire .
she did the same moves , only backwards and in high heels .
why did you come along if you're going to be so negative?
because we paid a hell of a lot for this week .
and you suggested it .
good morning .
we'll start out with breathing exercises .
place one hand on your stomach , and the other on you back .
take a deep breath
all the way down to your pelvic floor .
envision a string running all the way through your body
and passing out through the top of your head off into the cosmos .
you're suspended on the string , and you twirl upwards to the heavens .
take a breath ...
relax your arms and let them dangle .
the first phase is the flow .
each movement is followed by a new movement .
it's like tai chi , an eternal loop .
it goes on and on ...
take a breath .
the next phase is chaos .
let your feelings out .
father no speak swedish .
is he a yoga teacher?
we have come to pick berries .
gustav vasa?
this guy thinks i'm the old king gustav vasa .
excuse me ...
viswanathan raj?
gustav vasa?
right , gustav vasa .
don't close your eyes to the invisible .
he who looks outside is dreaming .
he who looks inside awakens .
oh , my ...
i've never seen anything like it .
like what?
something's happened to you , stig helmer .
your crown chakra is demonstrating great cosmic energy .
a red aura signifies the seventh sense of change and psychic power .
you're heading in a new direction .
and you blinked ...
would you like mine?
no , thank you .
what goal did you have this week?
i hoped to get rid of this ...
i weighed myself this morning .
i've gained 20 grams .
really?
i must be the only person on earth who gains weight on a fast .
are you going to do the survival course?
i wonder what it involves .
yeah !
i feel like a new human being , not a chicken in days .
did you eat too much chicken?
it's a long story .
i'm really dreading this .
it's only for a few days .
it's interesting .
i've done it a few times .
you face the real you .
i hope she's skinny .
praeparatus supervivat " , or " the prepared will survive " .
we'll spend a couple of days in the wilderness .
and your only tool will be a knife .
please empty your pockets and place your belongings in the bag .
camilla !
here's a knife .
thank you .
your knife .
anything else?
what is that?
a gps navigator .
for satellite positioning .
take a knife .
may i take two?
no .
we're going to have an easy run on the river in a kajak .
i suggest that you pair off .
keep your kajak on course and paddle where the water is most swift .
that's where it's the deepest .
okay , men .
you get to head the expedition .
let's launch the next bunch .
move it , jan .
good luck !
it looks pretty unsteady .
try to paddle in time .
grab the oars , ke .
take it easy .
this is a message from svensk hydro .
the power plant at storforsen will open its floodgates at 1 pm .
this presents a danger to anyone on the river .
oh , my god !
here you go .
hello ...
what? !
what are the names of the guys paddling off in the distance?
stig helmer and ole , come back here !
what's going on?
the floodgates are open .
wait here , i'll go to the rapids .
there seems to be a lot of water .
don't break the rhythm !
hold on , stig helmer !
no , there's not a trace of them .
they've probably gotten further downstream .
an easy run " , sure !
i'm never going to do this again .
have the rest of the gang backed out?
that leaves the two of us , then .
talk about a survival course !
what's the challenging run like?
you don't get a paddle .
a big steak with french fries wouldn't hurt right now .
but not for you , you're fasting .
i'm sorry ...
they'll find us soon .
they have heat detecting cameras .
look !
lingonberries .
no , these are bearberries .
arctostaphylos .
this is edible , it's a fern .
polypodium .
where did you learn all this?
i was a boy scout .
the beaver patrol " .
are you all right?
i'm fine .
all that's missing is the cucumber ...
we need to dry our clothes .
did you happen to learn about making fire?
the glass lenses of our wristwatches , sandwiched with some water
will make a magnifying glass .
then all we need is to gather some shelf fungi .
fomes fomentarius .
do you know the latin names of all kinds of plants?
just the ones we needed to learn to earn the " woodcraft badge " .
the police just called .
they couldn't see them from the helicopter .
if you say " i told you so " , i'll throttle you !
the kajak was found at brnnforsen .
that's 60 kilometers from here !
here ...
what's today's special?
shoots of pine .
some sourgrass , chanterelle mushrooms and pine gum .
and all this is edible?
the gum is like chewing gum .
it will help ward off hunger pains
while the shoots and sourgrass contain a lot of vitamin c.
you didn't happen to find a bottle of chablis premier cru 1982 , too?
what a day !
too bad it wasn't sunny , we'll have to try the lenses some other time .
i can tell that you enjoy the outdoors .
i liked going on hikes .
i liked going on trips with the boy scouts .
i used to play in the forest when i was a kid .
i haven't seen you this happy for a long time .
but i don't think it's all thanks to the forest .
i bet rebecka has something to do with it , too .
she's a fun person , but she is a bit odd .
you suit each other .
you're a fun person , too , but you are a bit odd .
what a strange week this has been .
but they're out there somewhere ...
i think .
isn't that typical?
as soon as you meet a nice man , he disappears .
body lotion?
not exactly , it's whiskey .
for emergencies .
did you bring everything?
the cans of spraypaint and stuff?
do we have to do this?
yes .
put on your gloves .
remember , you haven't seen a thing .
look , they'll see us with the surveillance cameras .
that's the point .
that's why we're wearing the suits .
put your nose on .
it's a beak .
look !
it's big bird !
well , they're not exactly minks .
we have to get them out before we blow the joint up .
but weren't we going to blow the car up?
there's not much insurance on that old wreck .
come on !
go spray some message on the truck , that's what they do .
what are you doing?
i was gong to write " swine " .
it's a broiler transport !
write something like " murderers " .
smurderers ...
what should we do with these?
stuff them in that bag for now .
hold on , because it's going to blow !
what a blast !
i've been in the wrong business .
talk about raising the roof !
what are you fooling around with?
what are you fooling around with?
nothing .
stig helmer , wake up !
listen ...
maybe they're looking for us .
wave !
this is a good spot to dump the stuff .
this is a good spot to dump the stuff !
did you see that?
it might be food .
that yellow stuff looks familiar .
hunger is making me hallucinate .
wake me up ...
aren't these the suits i bought ...?
somebody up there's pulling our leg .
well , at least these are warm and dry .
aren't you cold?
could it make any difference what you wear in a nightmare?
militant vegans blew up a broiler factory in stersen .
the police have no leads as yet .
that would be bruno's factory !
two people appear to have died in the rapids .
their kajak was found below the falls .
over to the sports desk .
i know they're alive .
i can feel it !
blasted mosquitos !
maybe we should put on the hoods?
why not?
this must be a dandy of a diet .
it would make business sense .
what?
bramserud & olsson botanical expeditions inc .
should we try that way?
no , let's go straight ahead .
finally , traces of civilization .
the trouble is , which way should we go?
let's go south .
how would you know that?
i checked out the anthill .
anthills are always bigger to the south .
you are absolutely incredible , " beaver " .
what a strange country .
there are no berries , just weird people .
let's go home !
do you have any other bright ideas?
like going north?
look !
it's those militant vegans .
fire a warning shot and i'll call the police .
are they shooting at us?
i sure hope that's not a bird dog .
you've probably seen this man , dr b. levander
in situations where he can profit from our phobias and hypochondria .
recently , he's made a foray into the diet industry
with the product " slim quick " .
let's consult our panel .
rune , you're a veterinarian .
what's do you think of the product?
it's an excellent product ...
for chickens that need to gain weight .
in addition to fish by products , our analysis revealed the presence
of the antibiotic coccidiostatika
which prevents parasites in chickens .
thank you , rune .
slim quick " is manufactured by bruno anderhage
the owner of svea broiler .
we heartily recommend the product " slim quick "
to people who are chicken hearted and birdbrained .
down the drain it goes !
next time ...
i knew it ...
hush !
i don't want to hear a peep out of you .
anderhage , here .
it's about your insurance .
terrorist attacks aren't covered .
they're a " force majeure " .
so we're not covered .
in accordance with item 71 .
tell your ceo that we're going to appeal .
i am the ceo .
you are the ceo ...
idiots !
i'll be going now ... to the police station .
to turn the two of us in .
it's just as well ...
and i hope i never have to see you again ... ... bruno asshole !
what a wimp !
this is the police speaking .
lay face down on the ground with your arms over your heads .
don't worry , stig helmer .
they probably just want to see some id .
come in .
they've been found !
i knew it !
how are they?
fine , i think .
they'll be here soon .
here they come !
oh , here they come !
what on earth are they wearing?
stockholmers !
they think they're so superior .
i'm so glad you're alive .
but why are you dressed like that?
i don't know .
you'll have to ask ole , but i don't think he knows either .
we've been so worried .
why are you in chicken suits?
there's no sensible explanation .
hello , darling .
guess what?
i'm going to quit dieting forever .
you have to learn to love the person you are , visnawathan said .
he's a guru .
how have you been doing?
just dandy ...
minus 22 kilos , and plus 73 hours of therapy later
i take great pleasure in presenting
one of the most accomplished disciples of visnawathan raj .
recently returned from a yoga center in nepal krishnamacharays !
give him a big hand !
he was known previously as stig helmer olsson .
he who looks outwards is dreaming .
he who looks inwards awakens .
lift your feet , krishnamacharays .
what's the latin name for chickenberries?
it's " cornus suecia " .
what about this chubby stonecrop , then?
you don't know?
it's called " sedum " .
the herb of love , the livelong ...
what's its name in latin?
it's " sedum telephium " .
wake up , stig helmer ...
wake up ...

bramserud & olsson botanlcal expedltions inc
