target acquired .
roger that .
target confirmed .
fire at will .
make your target , corporal .
you got a time problem , gentlemen .
lock your trs and get this over with .
trs verifying target .
just eyeball the fucker and pull the trigger .
i heard that , beckett .
we got incoming bogeys .
range , 650 yards .
we have a 5 mile an hour wind , midrange , coming from your lima .
attempting to confirm target .
sir , evers 'pulse , respiration and gsr are maxing out .
what about beckett?
no , steady as a rock .
it's like he's taking a nap .
you're running out of time , gentlemen .
take the shot , evers .
i could hit a hostage , master gunny  take the fucking shot .
stand down .
stand down , gentlemen .
you okay , master gunny?
perfect .
abso fucking lutely perfect .
target status . 'target destroyed .
he made that damn shot .
i can't believe it .
he made that goddamn shot !
game over .
your position was about to be compromised .
your directive was to abort that mission .
we're marine scout snipers , captain .
we don't abort unless we stop breathing .
you weren't supposed to make that shot .
no one's supposed to .
well , i completed my mission .
back in my days
fuck your days !
that was the luckiest fucking shot in the history of lucky fucking shots !
sorry i broke your toy , captain .
but if a sniper had to depend on that , he'd end up dead .
it's not a video game out there .
it's all about one shot and one kill .
you're a risk , you know that?
you're a goddamn liability ... that i , for one , am not going to risk ....
getting bored , are we?
i'm not cutting into your precious drinking time , am l?
begging the captain's pardon , sir , but yes , sir , i am .
and yes , sir , you are , sir .
i don't like you , master gunnery sergeant .
and i don't care about that fucking deal you made with the corps !
you fail that medical next week , i'll bury your ass back in the real world .
and that's a promise .
yes , sir .
thank you , sir .
who is it?
it's me .
open the fucking door .
about fucking time ...
you got it?
tell me you got it ...
who the hell are you?
hey ...
he's a big buyer .
lots of money .
he's okay , trust me .
you look like a cop to me .
fuck you .
he's no cop .
he'll fuck me .
you'll fuck me too ...
c'mon , baby ...
how much?
twenty .
she said 15 .
she's full of shit .
just pay him , for fuck's sake .
he's got good stuff .
only the cobra's ...
shut up !
how much .
let's see it .
just relax !
put the gun down !
they said they'd put me in jail !
i can't go to jail !
you fuckin 'bitch !
just put the gun down !
he's got cops everywhere !
i got him .
get your sniper .
congratulations , neil .
hey , buddy .
congratulations .
hey , nice going , neil , buddy .
good job .
mom , it's time .
no , he said he'd be here .
it's okay .
i talked to him yesterday
come on , the tv people want a shot of us cutting the cake .
we can't wait any longer .
okay .
sorry , mom .
this looks more like a campaign photo opportunity than a wedding .
we decided to forgo the speeches today ... because of an unavoidable absence .
lf that's beckett you're talking about , he probably got lost on the way to the bar .
well , he's right .
no way i could do this without a couple of tall ones .
sydney .
you knew i'd make it .
do me the honors?
okay .
actually , these kind of affairs scare the hell out of me .
many years ago , your old man made me promise him something .
that , were he not able to attend your wedding day ...
i would read this letter to you .
lf that grunt beckett is reading this , then i didn't make it .
i'm hoping this part of the letter is being read at your wedding .
i just wanted to let you know that i love you ... " and that i wish you and your bride nothing but happiness .
love her and cherish her always .
and may you both live as long as you want ... " and never want as long as you live .
neil , i've been holding onto this for a long time .
now i think it's yours .
congratulations .
thanks , tom .
jocelyn and neil finnegan .
every time i look at neil , i see the man paul never got to be .
well , i'm sure his father would be very proud of him .
you know , this is a circus .
she's got her eyes set on the white house , and won't stop till she gets him there .
he's the son of a war hero ... graduates first in his class at annapolis , harvard school of government .
climbing up the political ladder with honest living and hard work .
hell , he's got my vote .
mine , too .
you're hand's shaking .
when did that start?
a few months ago .
it's nothing .
might be , might not .
you should stop by the office and let me look at it .
tom , come on .
okay .
we're marine scout snipers .
the only time we abort a mission is when we stop breathing , sir .
it's a very big mistake .
besides the obvious , his conduct record since returning from europe ... has been questionable .
psychs are a bit disturbing .
and he's just ... old .
he's the same age i am .
we may get one shot and one shot only .
i want beckett taking it .
you suffered nerve damage when you lost the finger .
the condition has been steadily deteriorating ever since .
the digitorum tendon ... when functioning normally , flexes and extends the finger .
but here on the damaged hand ... you could have an involuntary reflex at any time .
and it's more likely to occur in a high stress situation .
what i see here , thomas , also looks like the early stages of palsy .
you can't be a marine forever , you know .
yeah , i know .
i was just hoping to make it to 65 .
you know , you should think about getting on with your life .
and do what?
well , you should meet someone special , you know , settle down .
why didn't you?
i did .
but i guess the few years i had with paul were enough .
and besides , you never asked me .
we had some good times , the three of us .
down at camp lejeune , remember?
syd  don't .
he didn't come back .
a lot of young men didn't come back .
why don't you get out of that horrible motel and come and stay with me?
tell you the truth , i've been living out of a sea bag all my life .
i've only got a few more weeks of the training sessions ... then the corps will just ship me out to some duty station .
then you should ask me to dinner sometime .
i haven't had a date in 30 years .
i'd really appreciate it if you didn't tell anyone about this .
okay .
thanks .
see you .
jarheads .
kiii him !
kiii him !
madness .
beckett , let's go !
let's get out of here !
goddamn , they're getting close !
love it !
just cover my ass , beckett .
shit !
finnegan !
lay him down .
you'll be okay , tommy .
you're going to be okay .
welcome to the tunnels , tommy .
can't see a goddamn thing .
you'll get used to it .
it's where the real shit happens , man .
here , take this .
what is it?
good luck .
took it off a gook a couple of days ago .
nva motherfuckers !
you didn't answer , master guns .
your door was unlocked .
lf i wanted clowns to wake me up , i would've joined the circus .
with all due respect , master guns , you should've been a comedian .
what the hell do you want?
we have orders to take you in to see the brass , master gunnery sergeant .
yeah , well , i don't want to see the brass .
let's get him in the shower .
sir , you could have your pick of a dozen of the corps 'best snipers .
corporal evers is particularly good .
i'm not interested in him .
i'm interested in thomas beckett .
this is nsa deputy director william avery .
we know each other , captain .
we served together .
a lifetime ago , sir .
best goddamn sniper i had the privilege of working with .
well , thank you , sir .
what can i do for you?
tom , i want you on a plane tomorrow .
to where , sir?
vietnam .
i want you to take out a target there .
a mountain warlord from phum bat .
he and his rogue army ... are running opium , weapons , anything they can get their hands on .
sounds like a pain in the ass for the vietnamese , sir .
why are we getting involved?
he's graduated to bigger and better things .
we have intelligence that leads us to believe ... he's been talking business with the jamaah lslamiyah .
what kind of business?
terrorism .
he's ventured into the big leagues .
well , with all due respect , sir , there's not very much here .
do we even know what he looks like?
captain laraby , would you mind excusing us?
of course not , sir .
addis .
finnegan .
thanks , tom .
his body was shipped home .
what was left of the body .
a body .
it's a long story , tom .
let me try to explain some of it .
during the last days before the fall of saigon , paul finnegan was recruited .
recruited by who?
the cla .
his first op was to help the khmer rouge run heroin out of the highlands .
his cut financed the covert operations .
as the years passed , our interests changed .
finnegan was offered a new op but the jungle had changed him .
that patriotic fervor had changed into something else ... something that makes him dangerous .
he's a threat .
to you , me , his family , and his country .
welcome to the tunnels , tommy .
what the hell's he doing here?
ls there any other way to handle this?
a deal or an arrangement?
there's no other way .
we've learned the ho chi minh police ... have set up a sting to capture him .
that cannot happen .
lf he is identified , you can imagine the problems that we might face .
the explanations .
not to mention the effect on his family ... his son ....
you're asking me to kill the man who saved my life .
i know how incredibly bizarre this must seem to you , tom ... but believe me , this is not the man that you once knew .
over the years , he has become a cold blooded killer .
and i'm ashamed to say , we bear some responsibility for that ... and an obligation to rectify the mistake .
as a sniper , you have the option to refuse the mission .
but i need an answer , tom .
by 0800 .
i'll understand if you can't do this .
i'll find somebody else .
no .
i'll do it .
alone .
i want no observer with me .
i don't want anybody else's hand in it .
how can you be so sure he'll do it when the time comes?
one way or another , he will get the job done .
it's all he's got left .
his iife isn't worth a damn unless he's risking it , or taking someone else's .
first time in ho chi minh?
last time i was here , it was called saigon .
beckett , thomas .
welcome to ho chi minh , mr. beckett .
first time in vietnam?
no .
do you want anything , sir?
lf you know what i mean , you know?
yeah , i know what you mean , and thanks but no thanks .
sure?
because ky mam can get you anything .
anything that you want .
any good massage?
happy ending .
thank you , sir .
your bag has arrived , sir .
you must have the wrong room .
i already have my bags .
not this one , master gunnery sergeant thomas beckett .
my name is quan .
detective , ho chi minh city police .
also your operations contact .
like i give a shit about some badge .
what's the operation code name?
cobra .
come on in .
lnteresting choice of shirt .
you look like a canadian tourist .
you'll find what you need here .
they say you can make million to one shot .
you are the go to guy .
yes?
they say a lot of things .
you rest after your trip , then we have some dinner .
we talk .
i show you the spot .
be ready 1 1 : 30 .
this bring back memories , mr. beckett?
they told me a little about you .
two full tours .
you were here for the worst of it .
none of it was good .
you must have been very young .
okay .
who else knows i'm here besides you?
lf you're talking about the ho chi minh police , no one .
lf they knew , i'd be a dead man .
all right , then how do we work this?
how do i find my target?
two weeks ago , i arrested his biggest dealer in ho chi minh city ... and convinced him to , how do you say , to finger the cobra for us .
why do you call him that?
they treat him like he's a king .
king cobra .
they're just kids , really .
some barely in their teens .
you cut off the head , the snake will die , believe me .
the dealer told us about a meeting between cobra and a new client .
we will be there to arrest him .
you take him out before that happens .
here in saigon?
saigon?
old habits die hard , huh?
at one of the establishments the cobra owns .
club cong .
check this out .
this is very new .
i'm going to make the dealer put it on the cobra .
it'll send a signal to your trs computer .
that way it'll be easy to find him in the crowd .
by the way , how are your weapons?
the aw magnum's just fine .
where did you get that?
fucking japanese .
pretty cool , huh?
how close do i get to my target?
300 meters , maybe .
outside , inside .
come on , eat up .
i think it's best i show you .
how long have you been a policeman?
six years .
when did the nsa recruit you?
couple of years ago .
you see how it is?
no better than before .
things need to change .
maybe you guys don't fuck up like last time .
was your old man in the war?
yes .
nva?
my father was an american gl , ninth battalion , 25th lnfantry .
nobody here knows this .
he die here?
went home to his real family somewhere in ohio .
there .
you see that roof?
that's club cong .
your target will be there tonight around 10 : 00 .
he usually sits at table on the upper deck .
will it be crowded?
it usually is .
what about the street?
he's got to come and go .
the entrance is on the other side .
there's no sniper angle .
after you take the shot , you abandon your weapon here ... and buy a ticket on tan son train .
it'll take you to the airport .
what about the cleanup?
a new identification has been arranged .
the body will not be claimed .
police will be satisfied the cobra is dead and no one will know who he really was .
i will not see you after this .
that's my cell phone number .
call only if you need something or if something is wrong .
and remember , one shot is probably all you get .
one shot is all i need .
everything is in place .
the op is on iine .
how's beckett doing?
our contact says he's fine .
no hesitations?
doesn't seem so .
target?
on the move as we speak .
his buyer has arrived .
so far , so good .
lf everything goes well , it'll be over in less than 10 hours .
from your lips to god's ear .
'cause if it doesn't , we're all in deep shit .
it's me .
thomas?
yeah .
it's 4 . '00 in the morning .
is something wrong?
sydney , i'm sorry , i ....
you sound so distant .
where are you?
about 30 years away .
thomas?
i'm sorry , syd .
i'm sorry for waking you .
are you okay?
i'm okay .
i just ....
i've been thinking about ... how you and neil are ....
you're ... the closest thing i've ever had to a family .
and i know ... sometimes i ....
sometimes i forget how much that's meant to me .
and i just wanted to ... make sure you knew .
we know , thomas .
are you sure you're okay?
yeah .
i'm okay .
look , i gotta go .
i'll tell you what .
i'll give you a call in a few days , after i get back .
you promise?
i promise .
yeah .
you know i love you .
i love you .
me , too .
i can't go through with this !
he'll know !
he knows everything !
i'll make sure he knows we busted you .
he'll never trust you again .
nobody is to know about this .
except you and me .
what the fuck is it?
doesn't matter .
just put this on the cobra .
this is crazy !
i'm a dead man if i do this .
you're a dead man if you don't .
any sign of tran yet?
no .
not yet ...
let me know as soon as you do .
they're here .
got him .
what the fuck are you looking at?
where the hell is he?
where the fuck you been?
he's like a fuckin 'turtle ...
fuck you .
you're late .
we were about to leave .
they're inside .
make your way to the roof .
he's here .
bring 'em in .
the cobra's here . ln the back , in the booths .
lf you don't need me anymore i'm going to split .
what's your hurry?
i just thought i'd party , you know ...
you're asking me to kiii the man who saved my iife .
what the hell's he doing here?
a lot of young men didn't come back .
what's the matter?
you don't look so good ...
i'm fine ...
who's going to get me a drink here , girls ...
goddamn piece of shit .
what's going on?
do it .
shit .
how are we going to make the deal work for both ...
what did you do?
nothing
what dld you do?
nothin '... l swear ...
now !
forgive me .
damn .
got you , fucker .
you're not that good a fucking shot , but you might get lucky .
what the hell happened?
beckett missed the target .
but he took out our goddamn backup?
we're fucked , truly fucked .
where is he now?
the vietnamese police have him .
it should be easy for our men to get to him , right?
our contact is not trained for that .
then get someone who is .
i should be the one to talk to him !
let khan choi handle it .
he's a bit more persuasive when it comes to things like this ...
talk to me .
i told you , my name is beckett .
thomas j. beckett .
and what are you doing here , thomas j. beckett?
soaking up asian culture .
the man you killed on the roof , he was cambodian national .
maybe you two got something to do with what happened at club cong tonight .
club cong?
look , i want to speak to the american consul .
sure .
you bet .
the national police have taken over the case .
you should have thought of that ... when you changed the plan and forgot to tell me about the secondary hit .
i'll see what i can do .
weird fucking world , ain't it , tommy?
finnegan?
fucking weird .
after all these years , they send my old hump buddy beckett to do the job .
that was avery's idea , wasn't it?
what happened?
you could always make the million to one shot .
losing your touch , or change of heart?
fucking avery lied to you .
that's something the two of us have in common .
which lie?
the one about you dealing drugs?
or running weapons?
or the jamaah lslamiyah?
they know about that?
why , finn?
what other choice does a dead man have?
i gave my life to serve god and country .
you're a dealer in death .
whose god and country do you serve?
the last thing i need is a sermon about death from an assassin .
i did the job they asked and they sold me out .
then why didn't you come home when it ended?
this is my home .
it was always my home .
i knew it the second we hit that lz in tay ninh .
after that first night , i knew i wasn't going back , tommy .
i was alive here !
even in all the death , i was alive !
nothing ever made me feel like that back there .
nothing and no one .
some people are born for war .
this isn't war , finn .
this is madness .
what about syd and neil?
you know , your son just got married .
i delivered your note as promised .
they don't exist .
they haven't existed for over 30 years .
it was better that way .
for everyone .
someone tried to kill me after i took the shot .
you're in it now .
you should have quit when you were ahead .
ln what?
i can bury them , tommy , that's what they're afraid of .
you're not the first one to come gunning .
they've been trying for years .
that's why i stay in the ditch .
sorry you got yourself into this .
but then , you always were an idealist .
that's what they counted on .
neil's the one i feel sorry for .
he thinks he's the son of a war hero .
every day , i watch this world descend into hell .
i'm just trying to find myself a nice comfortable seat with a good view .
somebody blew up the police station at ho chi minh .
what?
listen to me , you iittle fuck , and don't you say a word .
meet me at the people's unification building in two hours .
you come alone ... or i'll tell the ho chi minh police who you really work for .
i didn't know what they were gonna do .
they never ....
it was a game both sides played .
look , i didn't know .
they never told me the hit on you was part of the operation .
i swear .
what happened to finnegan?
they don't know yet .
they're still identifying bodies .
i've spent years trying to forget this shit .
you really think it was going to be that easy?
you're going to get me out of here .
and go where?
you're gonna get me another rifle and a sidearm .
and go where?
lf he's alive , he's in the ditch .
hang on a sec , senator .
we had some people in phnom penh .
they should be in ho chi minh in less than an hour .
the bad news is that our boy's gone awol .
what do you mean , awol?
he hasn't checked in .
what about finnegan and beckett?
they're still ld ing bodies , but neither of them are on the list so far .
i don't fucking believe this .
i'm going to have to call you back .
no , it's under control .
lf beckett is still alive , and he's gotten to our boy ....
i know .
you and finnegan were friends?
i mean , real good friends?
yeah .
he saved my ass once .
this must be hard then .
he's a bad guy .
i know .
how do you know he's up in tay ninh?
not in .
under .
when i knew finnegan , he was a tunnel rat .
everybody knows about them , and what they did .
yeah , well , they did what they had to do .
some say they like it .
you're not supposed to like it .
what the fuck do you know about war?
how can you be sure he's there?
because when i was in the jail , he slipped .
he mentioned something about " being in the ditch .
and that's what the rats called the tunnels .
should we contact someone?
someone you can trust?
right now , i don't trust anybody .
what the hell is that?
police or nsa?
nsa .
they're in pursuit of the signal .
our boy's headed towards tay ninh .
beckett's with him .
he's going after finnegan .
what the hell's he doing here?
say hello to stevie york .
we're the 6 : 00 news .
some men came through here midday .
they headed into the jungle .
one was white .
he's headed home .
you really expect to go in there by yourself and come out alive?
no .
you're going with me .
why would i want to do that?
you wanted to know why they tried to kill me .
the answer's in there with finnegan .
you see , there's something he didn't tell me .
the real reason they sent me .
and it was supposed to end with him ... and me .
where the hell did you dig this up?
it's my father's .
it's all he left behind .
i learned to shoot with it . ls it okay?
best damn sniper rifle ever made , if you ask me .
you didn't tell me your old man was a sniper .
you didn't ask .
they're around here somewhere .
it says they're right here !
our cambodian units found the cell phone on the side of the road to tay ninh .
they must have figured out it was traceable .
not they .
beckett .
what do we do now?
tell them to keep looking .
and pray that they find beckett before he finds finnegan .
it's getting  hold it down .
we're never going to find this place .
you okay?
there's more of them .
he's dry .
get him !
he's the last one .
he'll probably be heading for the tunnels .
there .
don't do it .
he's just a kid .
he was going to warn them .
right .
i know .
finnegan knows we're here already .
it's just a game to him .
we won the first round .
pass go , collect $200 .
now it's our chance to spend it .
what?
it's a game .
you know , like mahjong?
stay close to me and do as i say .
how do you know which way to go?
i don't .
great .
why not just yell out and tell them we're here?
how're we going to see?
no lights .
which way?
what?
i hear it .
sounds like music .
sounds like nwa .
what?
nwa .
niggas with attitude .
you know , lce cube , dr. dre?
the rappers .
sounds like fuck tha police .
what kind of idiots would write a song like that?
you ought to try listening to a little bob seger .
what?
couldn't leave it alone?
send some guys to take care of him .
you got yourself in some big trouble , boy ...
come on , policeman .
fight an 'die .
let him go .
he's not part of this .
he is now .
you brought him along for a reason .
i'm thinking agency .
and maybe nsa .
i'm not gonna waste your time trying to justify myself , tommy .
we're both killers .
different kinds .
when i kill a man , it's because he needs killing .
i look at his life and if it adds up to nothing , i take him out .
but you , finn .
you got to liking it .
i never did .
so what's this all about , finn?
how does it all end here?
it's about stevie york .
you remember stevie , don't you?
say hello to stevie york .
what the hell's he doing here?
the ap photographer?
it's about stevie and me and avery .
and gaylor .
john gaylor , the senator?
soon to be president , some say .
what about stevie york?
he filmed it all .
we were higher than kites .
smoking and hunting for three days without sleep .
there was nine of them .
six men and three women .
when it was done , we started getting paranoid .
we'd make york destroy the film .
but as the days passed ...
gaylor and avery kept getting more and more psycho on me .
so we made a pact , the three of us .
and then we killed stevie and made it look like the nva did it .
so what now , tommy?
what's our next move?
tell you what .
you could just walk out of here and go home .
lf i leave , the cop goes with me .
go , get out , beckett !
you know i can't let that happen .
you're going to have to kill me .
the only way i see it from here is to kill him .
what's your old saying?
one shot , one kill .
how about , one shot , two kills?
a million to one .
lsn't that what they used to say?
do it .
they're gonna kill me anyway .
he's right , tommy .
take your best shot .
the digitorum tendon flexes and extends the finger .
time's running out for one of us .
come on , tommy , make your move !
what's happening here?
they say you're the mongoose .
come again?
the mongoose .
it's an old vietnamese folk tale .
when god created the cobra , he made him king .
as time passed , the cobra became so powerful he thought he was god .
so god created the mongoose to take his power away .
what do they want?
whatever you want .
you have the power now .
you're kidding me .
it's true , i told you .
they're just kids .
kids do anything .
listen to me .
there's a colonel mckenna .
