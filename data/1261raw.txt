oh , mr president, things are more complicated than that .

yeah, it's ... we got a bit of pickle a bit of peacle, exactly
so, i was thinking one of us should withdraw now, i would be happy it were me .
nothing left to prove much less than a mayor or anything .
but i have a p. r proplem oh, p. r problem? is it serious?
it got out to the press that i've given my word .

yeah, that'll be my honour . mr president .
well , if you tried to make a name for yourself in gulf , you wouldn't start off by ...
wow, nice shot . ... challenging tiger woods .
you start small, local terms .
same as politics .
you don't start political career by running against former president of united states .
fine .
fine?
it's a privilege to run , it's a privliege to withdraw .
all settled .
what's settled?
we both put in mayor , so i just withdraw .

sally . is it me or did you just get it by the president guy .
yes , i think i did .
how could he choose from us
and, is it me or did you just say " yes" to the president guy?
yes , i think i did
look , sally , i'm sorry that i was late .
ok, but you can't take the president because of that .
did you really think that is the reason?
why? then .
my heart
use this
shut up !
sally , i want to talk to you .
sally . i want to talk !
mr president
yes, handy, what it is?
mr president
thank you very much
i can't do it . i can't draw back from the mayor race
excuse me?
i ... don't have the eagle things like you , but i'm a man of my word too .
and every man's word is important is it natural?
does he want money?
otherwise what is it
if you stay in the race, i'm sure you're going to score off me . but ...
i'm running for the mayor of mooseport
ya ... hoo !
he's loosing his money?
what's just happened?
you are running against the president
and your girl friend ditchs you .
ur hum .
i repeat . ur hum !
no , the president has no comment .
no, no comment . thank you .
that's all network's
the handyman's girl friend?
his girl friend? why didn't you tell me
i won't look like a idot
i tried to tell you mr president .
remember?
why didn't you try harder?
what must i to do now?
appologize? backdown?
you want to call bert langdon?
for what? i don't need a campaign manger for this .
hello , one second .
mr president . bert langdon on line 1
bert, what a coincident .
oh, well, that's what i gonna ask you .
eagle
it's dead mission i'm here . i'll be happy to roll up my sleeves and come up there if you want .
bert , i'm running against my plumber .
is there something i don't know?
you watching fox news?
the results are quite interesting .
the poll of course is preliminary, but it does harrison was surprising strong .
there are 8 % margin error and it's still early .
but it looks to be very close .
seems to me that president has got himself a good horse race .
eagle, you with me?
don't you mean " lose race "?
eagle, hey !
oh hu oh !
are you sally mannis .
yeah could i ask a question about handy harrison .
are you now dating the president?
no, i'm dating the president .
it's one date .
and i'm even not sure you should call it a " date
you don't call it a " date "?
what would you call it exactly?
can you answer us a couple of questions?
we won't ask you hours
have you and the president had sex yet?
who got sex !
think about it handy .
our mayor , we could have the president of the united states !
what are you trying to tell us?
come on, guys .
you know he's going to win
you're bad . you bastard !
come on .
thank you reuben
and you'd better keep an eye .
you're bananas , harrison
handy, handy ...
what's this, come on !
what's going on?
what's it look like?
your campaigner !
handy, handy guys, come on .
hey, handy . do you like it there?
oh, that's ... yeah .
guys , thank you very much in the moo's head and everything .
but irma . we disgust this .
i'm not compaigning . i'm not .
what?
do you care about sally or not
look, her going out with him , it's ... just a kind of ...
call a postman a parcle in two vasion . it's just my opinion .
lose the election, lose sally .
is that going to go anywhere, ok?
he's like 20 years older than me .
he is a president
so
power takes 10 years off a man handy .
rich , another 10 .
by timing you figure he's in great shape, you are not .
he is younger than you are .
so, you want a campaign or not?
better shape
i know i can kick your ass .
how do we keep this thing offerd? obviously it's to keep him presidential
just pound these mooseporters, what his unbelievable experience can bring to them .
look at it, think about for half an second .
harrison can't bring even a function what he brings .
what ever he is .
and what excatly is he preliminary research said he is something that actually we have never faced before , mr president?
and that is?
he is generally honest man, sir
come on , grace . all that means he has never run for public office
what you got?
bert
fbl, cla, nothing
and this turned up in a local paper and ... that's it .
that's it?
we're running against a pie eating champinon?
but think about this
he runs for mayor, but only when he think he is on the post .
he dates the same woman for 6 years , but he never pops the question .
what's wrong with the picture?
he won't take risks
he won't make commandment
and any man who won't make a commandment shouldn't be a mayor or anything .
that's good , how could we get it out? whisper campaign first , then radio, and eventually, we'll have to have some tv surport .
shouldn't get too expensive, but ..
mr president, i'm sure you don't want to hear this .
but would the easiest thing be ...
should we discuss our withdraw?
withdraw?
grace . he is the eagle
eagle cole has never run away from anything in his life .
now imagine what we'll do with finances finances
book deals, quarter board, library fund raising , you quit , you quit, got help us lose to promote we can't keep so still and say goodbye fast you can see a road roller .
mr president, this is not about mooseport , it is about winning !
it's about spending 3 million dollars to protect 20 .
maybe i should come and speak to her .
i ... i canceled that sir .
you .. what?
it ... seems obvious we are right in the middle of campagin .
it was millions of dollars .
well , sir, there is still that offer from the super motor's people
bullard, the ex president of united states can not do car commercial .
oh, have you seen the car , mr president
look at this, it's steepy style . and snappy president . and ...
bullard smooth head line, leathering steering ..
bullard !
get out ! get out !
i'll handle the money, eagle .
i'm sure there will be library pledgers something will turn up .
may i sit down , sir?
go in the corner, out of my eyeline
thank you sir
i can still see you .
yes , sir .
what about the girl?
what about sally handy, sally eagle .
he'll have to cancel the date .
wow, no, he can't cancel the date .
you said that, bert . the eagle doesn't back down .
you clear up what i didn't know, when i didn't know it . i will be fine .
shall i tell the press list , mr president .
yeah , oh , no, no .
call the press, have more over here in the morning, and get handy harrison here to fix the toilet .
you see what i'm going with this , do i have to draw you a picture .
i see , mr president, am i?
let's get to work come in
let's go, let's go . move on through .
move on home .
looks like at airport .
handy, what are you going to do?
good morning , handy good morning, mr president, you got toilet trouble, right?
handy, ah . i want to make it clear that when i asked miss mannis out, i have no idea that you two have relationship
and even though i found it reprehensible for any man in the experience i'm going romance me too
i also believe that woman's heart is hers and hers alone to give .
ah, it's a good point
so, i asked sally out in ignorance and she agreed to go
until she tells me she stands down , i intend to see her, there .
call him howling dog !
what did she say?
howling dog?
well ... if it's ok with you, sir , let's chew on that i bet ok
ok , you chew on that , and ... if you find that you can't swallow it, you let me know and i'll give you the hand lock, and over , ok?
go on in there and fix the toilet .
so , we're going to see your date , mr president . i don't know what you'll see .
thank you so much , thank you
oh , it's great mood, do we have any ice cream?
absolutely, sir .
and i think we find the way to solve the money problems .
really?
yes
product !
that's it?
nothing to it, you save 3 million dollars and look , still beautiful .
excellent ! excellent !
don't even miss it
ok, everybody , go back to work

local vet finds romance with past president .
wow , where did they get that picture
yeah , now there is next to the president in the front page .
so , what about later . i mean, you must go back later, like 8 : 30 .

i don't have enough time .
all right .
i'll cancel that , my ... you know

be on your toast, be sharp . you may have won your first debate, but it's a pay down .
gentlemen , i believe we are ready
it's starting .
live from the seaport town , the mooseport, the mayoral dabate !
with the candidates , monroe eagle cole and harold handy harrison
we take your now moderater , henry hitower
good evening, i'm hitower
i'me honoured to moderate the second and final mooseport mayoral debate .

mr hitower, could i ... , i'd like to make a statement first . is that ok?
mr president
oh , that's fine, i ... i have a statement also .
just ... , ok? thank you .
yes, getleman
hey, hi, everybody
hi, handy
i just want to say one thing
i'm a little embarrassed about the way i have been running my campagin .
an election, it shouldn't be about personalities , you know, or gulf or who was dating ,
sally , if you watching this ,
i was wrong to bring our relationship been to this .
i'm sorry
oh ... i guess i did it again , i just brought our relationship been to it again .
so, i'm sorry for that , too
i guess, what i want to say, folks, i thik an election should be about the town .
it should be about what we need and how we can work together to get things done .
the president can do great things for us
son of bitch
having him as a mayor , that's an oppounity we can't pass off .
tomorrow morning, i'm going to the polls , i'll cast my vote for the president .
monroe cole , for the mayor of mooseport
son of bithch
ladies and gentlemen
what you've just seen is a selfless act .
handy harrison , is mooseport
he thinks he is mooseport
he knows its problems
he knows his ports
he knows his plumbing
as only a person who lives here can
so tomorrow morning , i'm going to the polls and i'm walking into that booth , that simple piece of paper that our forefathers gave their lives to secure .
ah .... and i'm casting my vote for harrison , harold handy harrison, over there .
man , he is great .
what you've just seen, ladies and gentlemen , this politics is finest, politics should be .
very good
harrison
we did same thing, mr president
you son of bitch, you knew i got to do that, so you did it first .
i didn't know that, how can i know that?

blood sucking vampire

so, how can you not ask her?
ask what?
oh, i don't know, i probably should have ..
scared , i guess .
well, marriage is a sacry thing
i'll be the first one to tell you that
but once a while , there comes along that special girl
i know what you mean, that she did .
she is special
i just think , eventually , she will find somebody else .
you know , you always hope that next guy will be some loser .
not the president
handy , the 16 toll of our match, you laid up . yeah, i remember it .
you played the safe so you won
i never would be a president of united states, if i laid up
sometimes , you just got a goal for the green .
for sake of all
out the way , out the way
no comment, no question
handy
over there
once a politician tick himself )
always a politician
it's 10 minutes pass the hour, and there are 20 minutes left before the polls closes in mooseport min .

it was so beautiful
hello
oh ... i was thinking about ...
for once, don't talk please ,
what just listen, ok, can you do that?
a long while back
my mum asked me what i thought on you?
you probably find it's hard to believe this .
any way, could ask such thing, but she did .
i seen a man as admirer , i told her
a fraud man, certainly , but a man with principles
since the handy thing
i have seen a man who only cares about eagle and power
a man who was stood to anything to win a position he doesn't even want .
who someone he probably shouldn't even beat . and it angries me, and it upsets me .
mostly, it just made me sad
grace ...
