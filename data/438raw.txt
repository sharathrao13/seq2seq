three years ago this august .
if you're looking for work , you may want to try aberdeen .
that's about the closest mill work you'll find .
too bad .
it's just simple economics .
you know , we have a really nice casino , the wild cherry .
want to make some money , maybe you ought to go on down ... and try your luck at the blackjack tables .
no , i don't think so .
thanks .

thank you .
i insist .
i'll walk .
it's my pleasure .
it's okay .
i won't take no for an answer .
get in the car .
did i scare you with that one?
little bit .
i scared him .
you were gone a while , huh?
eight years .
harstad was sheriff back then .
aaron harstad , yeah .
sad story .
about five months back , he fell asleep at the wheel and hit a tree .
car folded up like an accordion .
he was a good man .
a good man and a good sheriff .
all right .
thank you very much for the ride .
welcome home , chris .
it's election month .
i'm your man .
okay .
say hey to your old man .
let's go .
can i help you?
little brother .
you come over here and give me a hug .
you look great .
what is this?
i couldn't let you be the only one looking good in uniform .
hey , ma .
chris is here .
whose tent?
that's for pete .
watch out , now .
chris .
look at you .
mom , how you doing?
how long's your leave?
how long do we have you?
for good .
i'm home .
really?
you're not kidding?
no .
hey , dad .
welcome back .
i wish you had told us exactly when you were coming .
i'd have cooked .
this is fine , mom .
we love chinese .
no , this is great .
so what are you going to do now?
i was planning to work at the mill , but you never mentioned it closed .
we didn't want to bother you when your father got laid off .
i got my business .
you saw the furniture outside .
and i substitute at the elementary school .
michelle pitches in ... we try to keep things simple .
pete .
this is your uncle chris .
hey , pete .
sit down .
say hello .
last time he saw you , you were barely walking .
and now i'm camping .
i said you could sleep on the couch .
it was chris 'room first .
your tent's going to take on water .
i can show you how to rig it .
doesn't look like it's going to rain to me , colonel .
sit down .
eat something .
first of all , i was a sergeant .
i worked for a living .
a grunt .
did you ever smoke anybody?
pete !
poppa's still got your gun locked up in the garage .
would you teach me how to shoot?
i figured that'd be scrap metal by now .
no .
i'm still hoping you'll melt that thing down on your own .
sorry , pete .
whatever .
i'm out of here , mom .
be back by 10 : 00 .
10 : 30 .
10 : 00 .
remind you of anyone?
okay , it rained .
happy?
no .
why don't you crash on the floor?
okay .
i'll crash on the floor .
you crash on the bed .
keep you dry .
did you really kill people?
ray ray .
hello , pudding .
what's up , man?
good to see you , man .
how you doing?
i'm all right .
what is that?
that's the love machine .
girls actually get in there?
how you been?
good .
clean living?
please .
you want a beer?
no .
believe it or not , i quit drinking .
i'd take a soda , though .
okay .
here .
thanks , man .
like that?
when you left town ... it gave me the idea i should do something with my life , too .
so i went down to seattle , got a guitar , and became all about music .
and then , pretty soon , i was about music and drugs ... and pretty soon i was basically just about drugs ... and ended up doing two years for b and e.
i'm sorry .
look at me now , though , right?
i've been clean and sober 14 months .
doing construction and renewing those supportive and healthy friendships ... from my past .
matter of fact , i talked to the bastards , told them you were back ... and they asked me to politely remind you that it is saturday .
as in ...
as in , kick off's in 20 minutes .
like old times .
you guys still doing it .
we're still doing it .
playing ball?
absolutely .
let's go , superstar !
just like the old days .
go deep .
come on .
when did that happen?
jay hamilton field .
his parents hadn't left him the mill for more than two minutes ...
before he shut it down .
why?
heads up !
because i opened my casino .
still got a gun , huh , jay?
still got your reflexes .
what?
did you get tired of being all that you could be?
no .
i'm still all i can be .
really?
i'll just have to see about that .
yeah .
what brings you home?
i just want to relax .
catch my breath .
you?
relax?
yeah .
not today .
i got it .
let's go .
come on !
is that how it's going to be?
that's how it is .
full contact , huh?
that's two hand touch .
too rough?
sorry , ladies .
pick up the outside !
fumble !
set !
how's that for touch?
that was pretty , wasn't it?
want to go get your pads?
that the best you got?
what?
here , take a walk ...
and knock a long loose?
touchdown .
first and your last .
you want to go?
nobody's going .
we're not going to go .
you almost caught it .
we stop them here , we win , right?
right , boys , last play .
you know how i like winning .
we need to put this to rest .
i will take care of ray .
you two cross .
you stay in and block .
booth?
isolate on vaughn .
you two cross ...
just give me the ball .
go low .
left knee .
all right , man .
you got it?
on the first hut .
ready?
break !
be strong .
all right , chris vaughn .
last chance .
black nineteen !
black !
watch the outside !
i'm open !
that's game .
sorry about that .
cool , man .
nice game , ladies .
what the hell was that?
that was a great game , wasn't it?
is that the bad one?
yeah , it was good .
hey , welcome home .
good to be back .
see you around .
if you're not doing anything later on , want to come by the casino?
introduce you to some nice girls .
drinks are on me .
what do you say?
see you tonight .
cool .
i'll see you later on .
be good .
hey , sarge .
good game .
maybe next time .
hold up .
maybe next time i won't see you in the bleachers , smoking weed .
welcome home , buddy .
i thought you had to be native american to own a casino .
hamilton's one sixteenth blackfoot now .
put it on his application .
and what he slid under the table convinced the powers that be it was true .
it's ours for the taking tonight .
let's pick some cherries , boys .
here we go .
i'm feeling lucky .
just so you guys know , i'm done after i triple my money .
that's what you said last time .
you wound up selling your body for bus fare .
he had to walk .
nobody's going to have any problems finding this place .
it's the subtle attention to aesthetics that i find most impressive .
blends in with the mountain so nicely .
hi there .
hi .
how you doing?
see?
not bad , huh?
it's not bad .
a lot of pretty girls .
i'm getting chips .
let's gamble .
we'll see you at the shower tower , okay?
isn't it wonderful?
all your gambling needs under one great , big roof .
you got your atm machines , tellers to cash your paycheck ... and when you're here , you don't got to worry about things ...
like child support , rent , laws of mathematical probability .
gentlemen , mr. hamilton would like to invite you to the vlp lounge .
the dream team .
you all healed up?
nice place .
welcome to my world .
tonight all the drinks are on the house .
if you need a line of credit , say how much .
if you need a little female companionship , done .
all right?
get inside .
have a good time .
where you going?
don't you worry about me .
i got a few things to do .
enjoy .
just remember , nothing in here is free .
ma'am .
cherry shot?
ray , be nice .
come on , this place is nothing but fake boobs ... and real assholes , if you ask me .
just water for me .
drink up .
we got money to win and girls just waiting .
we are vlps .
here's to you , chris .
welcome home .
cheers .
let's play , boys .
go right ahead .
already lost $1 ...
good night .
okay .
don't say we never did nothing for you .
don't worry , buddy , everybody's scared their first time .
come on .
get in there , chris .
okay , just sit back and enjoy it .
this'll get you started .
lf you're not back by morning ... we'll send a search party .
have fun .
stop drinking .
you from here , or are you just visiting?
a little of both .
i grew up here .
so you're seeing all the old faces .
you could say that .
your voice sounds very familiar .
chris .
deni .
look who's back .
so , good surprise?
i told you it was better than gambling .
you met candi?
hello .
hey , candi .
let's go .
six , easy six .
looking for a six to win .
we can do a six .
can we do a six?
i think i can do a six , right?
we got liftoff !
whack it , boys .
whack it .
blue or pink , what do you think?
who's up for two out of three?
i'm getting killed .
let me have a c note to put $200 on a bet .
no .
come on .
hell , no .
look at them .
he's hot .
that's what i'm talking about .
give me a hard six . $5 , hard six?
yes .
i'm in .
hard six . $5 on hard six .
there's another $100 .
boom .
give me some dice .
looking for a six .
all right .
oh , please .
please .
thank you .
and you .
jimmy , don't roll .
give me the dice .
no , i got it .
hard six , six .
looking for a six .
seven out .
line in , the dark side wins .
last come'll get you some .
you're good .
but i saw it .
saw what?
i saw the switch .
this is a clean game , asshole .
let's see about that .
bet you'll roll a seven .
it's not your roll , sir .
sir , it's not your roll .
will you call security?
put your bets down on the passline .
these dice are coming up seven .
why don't we just let it go?
no .
we're going to let it ride , jimmy .
the dice are coming up seven .
it's not your roll , sir .
come on , baby .
what a surprise .
no , folks .
no payouts .
wait a minute .
calm down .
just take care of that bet , then we're even .
i would , but it wasn't a legitimate bet .
you're not the shooter .
security .
it's not your roll , sir .
is there a problem?
the problem is your dice are loaded .
does your boss know about this?
just give me my money .
come on .
let's go .
what now , bitch?
come on !
special forces .
wow .
i'll take that .
what are you doing?
special forces .
special treatment .
this guy knows hamilton .
you just hold him down .
come on , burke .
folks .
he's pretty banged up , inside and out .
whoever did this left him for dead .
a lesser man wouldn't have survived .
i need a statement from him , doctor .
he's in no condition to give you one ...
i'll also need a copy of your write up , with toxicology ...
and blood alcohol level .
what are you talking about?
i'm just trying to get some facts .
you need to be arresting whoever tried to kill my brother , not testing his blood .
i'm just doing my job , michelle .
okay?
i understand how you feel .
but we still don't know who started all this .
it wasn't chris .
just find out who did this to him , stan .
i'll do my best , mr. vaughn .
i really will .
in the meantime i have to file a full report .
will you let me know when i can talk to him?
thank you .
he's going to be fine , michelle .
thanks .
beautiful flowers .
thank you .
they're for my best friend .
hey , sarge .
so much for our vlp status .
don't they teach you any basic fighting skills in the army?
how did you do?
not good .
but i tell you , that guy was feeling me this morning .
you okay?
that was a hell of a homecoming party .
chris , i don't know if you noticed , but this ain't exactly home anymore .
hang on .
let me help you .
come on .
i'm good , mom .
i got it .
need some help?
no .
i'm just milking it .
there's some old crutches in the garage .
thanks , pete .
crutches .
that's nice .
did you see the hole?
mind if i watch tv?
no , that's cool .
somebody's feeling better .
little bit .
you make this?
need anything?
something wrong?
no , it's good , man .
it's good .
no , i'm good , dad .
thanks .
changed the plugs a while back .
i appreciate that , dad .
i might've had serious issues with your career choice ... but it just didn't seem fair to take it out on an innocent truck .
where you headed?
i was going into town to get supplies .
want to come?
let's go .
your whole life , all you wanted to do was get out of here .
what made you come back now?
you're going to think i'm crazy .
i would think about the mill .
when i was a kid going to visit you at work , the smell of that fresh cut cedar ...
you remember that smell .
i remember a lot of nice things before the mill closed .
when did they go out of business?
closed about six months ago .
there's a home depot about 15 minutes up the road .
and that?
don't ask .
first of all , i just want to say thanks .
for what?
for making that stickman .
he's been fired and his gaming permit's been pulled .
i just have no idea why my security cameras didn't catch that .
they miss a lot in your place , don't they , jay?
look , chris , i hate seeing you like this .
your boys did it .
wait a second .
so they got a little rough .
they're a bit edgy .
understandably .
you don't know what kind of assholes they have to put up with on a daily basis .
look , they've been reprimanded .
but they say you went nuts , man .
i'm sorry .
insensitive .
i know the proper term that vets use is post traumatic stress ...
what the fuck you talking about?
whatever .
you tore my place apart ... and it wasn't easy to get my guys to agree not to press charges .
chris , if you had a problem , shouldn't you have come to me?
i want to bring you inside .
i want to make you head of security .
what do you say?
no .
i guess you probably need time to think about it .
i figured as much .
this is for you .
it's a little something to help you get , you know ...
come on , man , don't be like that .
i came all the way out here to your house , just to see you get back on your feet .
i'm going to the sheriff .
i'm really sorry you feel that way .
i'll see you around , chris .
i know , it was a good time , wasn't it?
excuse me .
excuse me .
i got to call you back .
hey , chris .
it's good to see you up and about .
you're looking spiffy .
i'm here to press charges .
this isn't about that incident at the casino a while back?
yeah .
it is .
because that matter's closed .
you're lucky you weren't brought in on charges .
i mean ...
did you even look into it?
they did an internal investigation .
that's good enough for me .
an internal investigation?
i know you're familiar with the term no fly zone .
because that's what the casino is .
since the mill closed down ... that casino is the main source of revenue in this town .
so case closed , basically .
we'll see you .
i'm not going to let this stand .
excuse me?
what did you say to me?
i said i'm not going to let this stand .
you're lucky to be alive right now .
that's all you need to be concentrating on .
this is my town .
okay?
i'm the sheriff here .
i'll tell you what will stand .
not the other way around .
now please get out of my building .
come in .
thanks .
this belongs to you .
i appreciate that .
i thought this was history .
could have left it in the trash , but i ...
deni?
nice to see you , dear .
hi , mrs. vaughn .
can i talk to you outside for a second?
quick walk .
mom , i'll be right back .
how you been?
been better .
talk to the sheriff yet?
i went down to the police station .
i talked to somebody with a badge .
he sure as hell didn't seem like much of a sheriff .
he's up for reelection , you know .
maybe you could take his job .
somebody ought to .
how about you?
nothing but sunshine and pine trees .
been reading these books .
teach you how to cultivate your happiness .
focus on the future .
go with the flow , that sort of thing .
is it working?
i have my moments .
so , the casino , huh?
yeah .
been there almost a year .
treating you good?
a lot better than it treated you .
i like that .
jay hamilton's done well for himself , hasn't he?
he's a real go getter , that one .
he must be .
i heard he got you .
that lasted about eight minutes .
it was a long time ago .
you still work for him , though .
rent's got to be paid , chris .
i suppose so .
hope to see you around .
do you?
thanks for the jacket .
and where is he?
it's okay , mom .
he's stabilized .
it was close .
crystal meth .
i'm sorry .
i never did it before .
it's true .
we might've kind of pushed him into it .
where'd you get the drugs?
i'm not really sure ...
stop .
where?
from the security guys working at the casino .
chris , wait .
call the police .
no .
it won't do any good .
is pete okay?
he'll be fine .
what are you doing?
no , chris .
not like this .
listen to me .
if you go out of here with that gun , they're going to nail ...
i've been looking for you .
guess that changes our relationship a bit , huh?
you should not have come looking for trouble .
keep your hands up .
get out of the vehicle now , chris .
now !
step back , please .
just move toward the front of the car .
put your hands on the hood .
i advise you to give this offer more than a little serious thought .
if you go to trial , you stand to do 18 years .
now , this is a sweetheart plea .
normally they wouldn't even put it on the table ... but your military record can't be ignored .
three months home arrest , some community service ...
pretty generous offer , chris .
but i'd have to plead guilty .
look at it from the other side .
there's over a dozen witnesses , none of whom will paint a flattering picture .
he started busting up the machines .
there was a gunshot .
he just went crazy .
a complete psychopath .
they're only offering me this deal just to keep me quiet .
i still say you should take it .
i wasn't wrong .
and i won't say i was .
our job is to keep order .
there was no chance of that once he came in .
me and my men , we were just trying to control him .
he's highly trained , violent .
a very dangerous person .
so violent , so dangerous , so highly trained ... that he dispatched six of the casino security staff single handedly .
six men , single handedly .
to hurt people and destroy property .
he went directly for everything .
he just came in and took over the place .
you said he broke your arm .
yeah , that's correct .
my right forearm .
both bones with a single shot .
it was crazy .
toss a couple of drunks now and then .
guys try to grope the girls .
but nothing with this sort of violence .
did he give you any kind of advance warning ... a chance to defend yourself?
we tussled , but he's a big guy .
he was on a mission .
besides , he seemed to be too busy enjoying himself from what i could see .
so from what you saw , he seemed to have some kind of purpose?
he had a point to prove .
i was emptying machines when he came in and started swinging .
i was trying to get out of there .
he was a menace .
a very dangerous person .
military trained .
he seemed like a complete psychopath .
nothing close to this .
i didn't know what he'd do .
i was frightened .
he came for us .
no doubt in your mind?
no doubt .
i have no further questions .
mr. crowe , you may present your client's case .
you're fired .
your honor , i'd like to plead my own case .
order !
if you choose to represent yourself , and not be represented by legal counsel ... you realize that you can't then claim a mistrial on that basis?
yes , i do .
very well , mr. vaughn .
i don't deny anything that was said here today .
does that mean you're changing your plea to guilty?
i'm not guilty of anything ... except standing up for myself when the law wouldn't .
objection .
he's trying to introduce prior events .
sustained .
mr. vaughn , stay on point .
i grew up in this town .
people used to walk tall in this town .
they wouldn't have traded the mill for a crooked casino .
we're not here to listen to civic speeches ...
and they wouldn't have stood around while drugs were sold to kids .
objection !
sustained .
mr. vaughn , you're close to being held in contempt .
i was justified in what i did .
and if you acquit me of these charges , then i'm gonna run for sheriff .
mr. vaughn .
and if elected , i'm gonna fix this town .
order .
please take your seat .
mr. vaughn , you are now charged with contempt .
and i will make sure that this ...
objection .
sustained . ... never happens to anyone again without punishing those who did it .
i'm ordering the jury to ignore what they've just seen .
mr. vaughn , take your seat .
order .
or you're all charged with contempt !
mr. foreman , has the jury reached a verdict?
we have , your honor .
defendant , please rise .
we find the defendant , chris vaughn , not guilty .
this is mine .
sheriff vaughn !
you won the election .
congratulations .
but we do have a tradition of professional courtesy up here .
and i can personally vouch for each and every one of these men .
they're good deputies .
you're all fired .
hey , chris .
license and registration , please .
you're joking , right?
license and registration .
what's the problem , sheriff?
you .
and the drugs you're peddling out of your casino .
the only thing that's going on in my casino is construction .
you took care of that .
that's right .
and i plan on taking care of everything else , too .
a casino is a license to print money .
why would i jeopardize that by selling drugs?
because you owned the town , jay .
that's changed now .
really?
the only thing i think has changed around here ... is that you get to wake up every morning and put on that nifty little badge .
but underneath it is the same guy who couldn't make it playing college football ... and apparently couldn't make it in the army ... and not really ever gonna make it as a cop .
is that right?
yeah .
and if you push too hard , you're going to be a man who never gets to see 40 .
license , please .
thanks , sheriff .
sir , get your taillights fixed .
it's your last warning .
what's wrong with my taillights?
they're broken .
morning , sheriff .
morning , deputy .
no .
come on , man .
you know i hate cops .
you've been sheriff for about two minutes , and i'm already starting to hate you .
i'm a convicted felon .
i've got pull around here .
now you're a crooked cop doing favors for friends .
that's how it starts .
next thing you know you'll be taking bribes , setting up roadblocks ...
frisking dudes 'crotches .
are you done?
ray , i need your help .
don't do that .
i need you to take me to drug school .
i get to wear a uniform?
the stuff in this town is five star , factory pure .
so let's go get the factory .
easier said than done .
we know hamilton's boys are selling that shit down at the casino .
yeah , but 99 % of the time they're clean .
so we got to play follow the money , starting with the tweakers .
that'll give us the suppliers .
these guys are real edgy , so delicacy is the key .
then we put the squeeze on them ... till they spit out the location of the next buy .
where'd you learn that , ray?
cops .
that's a good show .
we strike .
i thought you said delicacy was the key .
that's right .
delicacy and precision .
hey , what's up?
get out of here .
you're sure you're not carrying anything?
i don't have shit .
officer .
yeah .
search him .
this is going to be a switch .
spread your legs .
arms down .
you been working out?
nothing there .
somebody needs a bath .
now you read me my rights , then you take me in ... and i call my lawyer .
okay .
but i have a hunch there may be something else in here .
could be .
go to it , deputy .
have a good time .
he ain't talking .
i know .
handles pretty good .
he's clean .
guess we got to go with plan b.
screw you both .
i do have a bit of information for you .
it's not just me , actually .
there's a whole lot of people in this one .
spit it out .
you're gonna get hurt .
what an idiot .
why does it always have to be your fight?
you might need this .
no .
i put my guns down a long time ago .
come on .
you're just being stubborn .
you and me both , boy .
chris , listen .
you be careful .
i will .
please step away from the vehicle !
mr. booth , are you still upset over that body cavity search?
i forgot , you got no vehicle .
please disperse !
there is nothing to ...
can i talk to you?
sure .
over here?
i'm gonna stay here with him tonight .
i need you to look after my parents 'place .
think they're gonna take it that far?
i'm with you , man .
i'll check in later .
okay .
a drive to right field .
it's dropping for a single .
you making house calls?
don't shoot .
hey .
how's the food around here?
nice .
salad , fried chicken ... potato salad .
do you have glasses?
yeah .
do you have to work tonight?
i quit .
i figured you were making some changes around here ...
i could make a few myself .
salt and pepper?
who is that?
pete .
want something to eat?
no .
i'm good , man .
i got to get a bigger bed .
no , you don't .
do it .
i'm hungry .
we've got leftovers .
i want pancakes .
