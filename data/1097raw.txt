i hear you're having troubles .
no wonder !
look at you .
you wanna change your life so you come to hear the story .
high school popularity ain't a contest , i\ x9ds a war .
dizzy harrison is its greatest casualty .
see , his story is really my story .
because behind every so called hero ... ... is a little pissed off dude that don't get no credit !
we have to go back a ways .
even as a small child , dizzy harrison had his own particular style .
as you can see , i didn't have a lot to work with .
i hurt myself !
things didn't get any better from there .
as the years went by , he got taller , whiter , skinnier .
first day , senior year .
and we're gonna be the top dogs .
i wish i'd drowned this summer .
we all do , kirk .
we'll always be blips .
blips?
we're barely on the radar !
not this year .
we're seniors now .
i'm with dizzy on this one .
i\ x9ds never too late to make a change .
full metal jacket .
dad , put those away !
you're such a dork !
i say we bail .
home schooling?
my dad could teach drinking .
nobody bails , bands stick together .
guys , relax .
music has the power to transform .
there's some pain .
good luck , son !
yo , blip?
little help?
i'll never get used to that .
can anyone help me?
get out of the way !
you're not going to talk to her .

like a wood elf versus al'kabor .
you'll get power leveled !
we're not playing everquest , we're on earth .

you remember !
tha\ x9ds really sweet .
i imagine god having an ass like that .
did that sound gay?
i've been thinking , we're seniors now ... ... and maybe sometime , if you wanted to drink coffee ... ... near me ... ... l would pay .
truthfully?
yeah?
you're not my ...
type .
you know those moments when a man makes ... ... a decision tha\ x9dil change his life ... ... and he steps up to become the hero he was meant to be?
this ain't one of those moments .
i thought about this type thing .
to be honest , you're not my type either .
did you think tha\ x9dd work?
no , but i thought it was worth giving it a shot .
you know something?
yo , freak !
what are you doing?

innocent conversation .
innocent?
then wha\ x9ds this?
oh , my god !
tha\ x9ds disgusting !

i know what you're thinking .
i\ x9ds not medically possible .
but let me ask you this .
are you a doctor?
i have good news .
your son's condition is treatable .
what condition?
the fact that i can pee around a corner?
watch your mouth .
he can't help it .
wha\ x9ds wrong with dizzy , in medical terms ... ... i\ x9ds called tourette's syndrome .
tourette's syndrome?
are you out of your fucking mind?
language , son .
you won't cure him with force , papa bear .
i\ x9ds going to take a lot of hugs and a lot of drugs .
only take one of these a day .
nice pack .
there he is .
diz?
they gave me these pills for my tourette's , but they're not working .
come on , i\ x9ds not that bad .
not that bad?
at least as blips ... ... we were invisible .
you break your dick in front of the whole school ... ... people remember that .
his life is ruined .
i mean , i'm an idiot .
i'll never be able to go back to school again .
i need more of these pills .

glory hallelujah !
glory hallelujah !
ladies and gentlemen ... ... brothers and sisters ... ... i'd like to talk to you all about sex !

do you know what the best form of sexual abstinence is?
being me .
can i get an amen?
amen !
do you wanna talk about some pain?
let me hear you !
that boy's got the spirit !
he's an idiot !
has a member of the opposite sex ever told you you're not her type?
let me hear you shout amen ... ... if you ever had duct tape ripped off your naked buttocks !
let me hear you shout amen if you ever had your manhood right angled ... ... in front of the entire congregation !
now let me hear you shout amen up high .
amen !
let me hear you shout amen !

out of the way , red .
i've been in the pen a while .
everything you saw on that screen was completely ... ... true .
they're right .
i'm a liar .
i don't know what i was thinking .
actually , i do know what i was thinking .
i was trying to become something more than just a blip on the radar screen .
so i made someone up .
someone i thought you'd all like .
and all because i cared more about what other people thought of me ... ... than what i thought of me .
but i bet i'm not the only person here who's ever let that happen .
what is this?
broke dick , broke dick !
broke dick , broke dick !
better come scoop up your friend .
move it !
anybody got a staple gun?
who's the bitch now?
diz !
oh , my god , you're bleeding !
my nose .
the crowd , they're animals !
no , animals are kinder .
they don't boo when they're killing something .
diz , you are amazing .
what was that for?
can't i appreciate you?
you're scaring me .
wha\ x9ds going on?
you've inspired me .
i have to do something i've wanted to do a long time .
i have to let somebody know how i feel about him .
you know , nora ...
better than playstation 2?
now it is .
yo , i guess i\ x9ds me and you .
and us .
and me .
would you two get a room?
i'm sorry .
i don't know what to call you .
broke dick seems to be popular .
you're the biggest liar i've ever met .
you're right , i'm a liar .
they called me " dan the man .
what?
that was before i lost the braces and grew boobs .
then i became " danielle the body .
i dropped all the friends i had because they looked like the old me .
and very selfish and mean ... ... but i just wanted so badly to fit in .
been there .
do you even ride the motorcycle?
yeah , actually i do .
but it usually takes a station wagon or a bush to stop me .
so , what do we do now?
don't ask me .
the last plan i had blew up pretty badly .
no kidding .
so you see ... ... i saved his narrow behind .
and he got to kiss the girl .
i hope that inspires you .
it has .
i\ x9ds taught me a lot .
i\ x9ds easy for a man like me to forget what most slobs will do to get a woman .
my fault , i talk too much .
that really did burn me , sorry .
oh , god !
you okay?
no , he clipped it .
tha\ x9ds why i wanna use you .
you staring at my janet?
no .
no way , man !
can we do that again?
he couldn't understand what i said .
i'm sorry , that sucked !
look at that !
don't yell for mercy .
oh , god , i blew the line .
check me out !
bat wings !
cut !
cut !
i need three gallons of mineral water ... ... 16 martini olives ... ... and enough hummus to cover this beautiful girl's body .

who's the bitch now?
hey , man .
you got a smoke?
how you doing?
better now .
okay , cut .
