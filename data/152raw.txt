what is this?
hey !
what's going on?
all the satellite signals are gone !
get someone here , quick !
lam , call engineering and have them check the backups .
sorry to call you back on your wedding day .
what is it?
the end of the world?
some big shit like that !
what is it then?
all the satellite signals were disconnected .
only the underwater cables are still functioning .
stanley station is still checking the backups .
hong kong # 1 is down , we couldn't get signals from # 2 and # 4 , and # 6 is toasted .
what should we do?
call the doctor .
we still haven't found him .
oh !
he's over there !
hello?
dr. ken !
what is it?
i've been trying to call you .
something major is going down at stanley !
mr. ken , mr. john is already here .
the satellite signal was completely down for 30 minutes .
it's back to normal now , but all the backups are gone .
lnitial investigation shows no signs of sabotage .
as for the breakdown , we simply couldn't determine the cause .
you'll have to figure that out .
thank you so much .
let's go .
that's it !
what did the observatory say?
the sunspots showed no irregular activities in the past 24 hours , and there're no record of planetary explosions .
even guangzhou and shenzhen reported nothing special .
ln other words , it only happened in hong kong .
look , even the server is toasted .
we should've easily detected such high levels of energy .
yes , i understand .
i understand perfectly , but ...
but you know we can't operate without a backup system !
we'll create our own if we have to !
right ...
call the insurance company right away .
well? ls clarence still upset?
you would be too if it were you .
but i don't think anyone needs to be responsible .
the antenna was wrecked by him .
looks like the insurance company will suffer the most .
they'll lose their pants !
mr. ken said it'd be a few more minutes .
did you tell him this is regarding his own life?
i did , but he's dealing with something even more important .
more important than his own life?
that's what he said !
wait .
excuse me !
why are you here?
why are you here?
my buddy called me here !
chiu tai pang , from sun leung tam , cld .
nice to meet you .
detective chiu , you're here !
boss said to see him the moment you're here .
detective chiu !
it's okay .
i know them .
what shit are you in now , classmate?
so many cops here to see you .
mr. chan .
lnspector yip , james from the uk .
hello !
how do you do?
take a seat .
what can i do for you?
ln the past 3 months , 3 scientists had died mysteriously .
they all had one thing in common .
they were voted " top ten future leaders " by century magazine .
mr. ken , were you on that list as well?
we have reasons to believe that your life is in danger .
so this flimsy piece of paper is the " top ten future leaders " certificate?
so this flimsy piece of paper is the " top ten future leaders " certificate?
yup !
any prize money?
nope .
let me explain this to you , big eyes .
do you know each year the u. n. chooses only 10 people as mankind's future leaders?
i was one of them , and also the first chinese ever selected .
what's so smart about you then?
i'll make it simple for you .
before , it took this size of cable to transmit data .
now , this will do the trick .
ls that it?
that's it !
then i have something here that'd make you even happier !
what is it?
congratulations , mr. ken , you've been awarded ...
best boyfriend of the year " !!
aren't you a happier man now?
are you proud?
any prize money?
no .
prizes?
nope .
no way !
i've got to have something !
mr. ken .
mr. ken?
have you ever heard of a group called " brotherhood of technology "?
uh ... no .
never mind .
really , i've never heard of them , and i've never received anything from this group .
hold it .
are you taking his statements?
what's the charge?
you don't have to answer them .
you're a cop too .
don't interfere with our work .
i'm off duty now , and i'm speaking as his friend .
we do not suspect mr. ken .
we're just concerned about his safety .
do you know liam anderson?
i do .
he died last night .
why wasn't this announced?
we have to keep it confidential because his death was very peculiar .
mr. ken , let me ask you once again .
where were you at around 10 : 30 last night?
that was when our satellite signal went down !
the antenna was burnt at around that time .
by the way , madam , why was mr. anderson in hong kong?
we're not too sure either .
he was reported missing in edinburgh , and was selected as chairman of global bank just last month .
ml6 has always thought he was kidnapped by terrorists .
was he rich?
not really , but he's influential enough to control half of europe's cash flow .
wow , that was one hell of an explosion !
really?
hey , detective chiu !
are you transferred back to the city?
did you get promoted?
promoted?
you've got to be kidding .
i wish .
my superiors asked me to forward these to some big shot .
turns out that big shot is you !
i mean , i have a higher ranking , a better paycheck , and a bigger condo .
but you're the man !
hey , detective , is it an in thing now just to wear the gun case?
ls the info here?
who are you?
these are confidential !
ah ... dr. ken !
he is dr. ken tit sun .
dr. ken?
don't you specialize in information transmission technology?
i don't suppose you're an expert in forensics?
i'm just doing research .
please ...
thanks .
obviously , there was an explosion at the scene .
according to witnesses 'statements , they think that the explosives were already attached to the victim's body .
was anybody else there at the time?
did anyone else get hurt?
well ... one was over here , the other one was over there .
but they're both lucky .
they only received slight burns on the skin .
according to the record , mr. anderson weighed about 175 pounds , but his identifiable remains totaled less than 10 pounds .
that includes a portion of the liver , one section of the spine , one complete left foot , and a shoe and sock that were hardly torched .
there's also his skull , but it's completely deformed .
a deformed skull?
sure !
the skull is the hardest part of the body .
it's more difficult to alter it .
you need at least 3000 degrees celsius to perform cremation .
the explosion only lasted half a second .
it must've been really powerful !
have you performed an autopsy on his spine , liver and skull?
yes .
it's all in here .
does the report state that the inside was burnt , but the outside was normal?
bingo !
perfect !
were there any traces of explosives?
well , that's the oddest thing .
a ml6 member claimed that he saw the victim's bible catching fire first .
but all was not burnt .
the last chapter remains .
as for traces of explosives , we couldn't find any near the crime scene .
did you notice the sticky grease stain?
we're running it through the lab .
we think it's only burnt lard .
do you think it's human?
are you serious?
you mean this??
i believe it's spontaneous combustion .
the u. s. has recorded cases of spontaneous combustion as early as 1952 .
the evidence was very similar to the ones at the tower .
but how can someone just explode?
the human body consists mostly of water .
water is h2o .
both hydrogen and oxygen are the most inflammable substances .
why can't there be an explosion?
what caused the explosion then?
even though there had been a few instances , no reasonable explanation can be found .
did mr. anderson die of natural causes?
i don't know .
but , if someone can somehow cause another human to combust , and if that person wants to kill me , i don't think anyone can protect me .
i do not wish to be followed by strangers .
furthermore , i don't believe someone's trying to kill me .
the police are just concerned about your safety , mr. ken .
i know .
i think you just want a cop to protect me , to show your boss that you've done your jobs .
tai pang will do !
this time i must agree with him .
this shit is huge , and you want me to protect you?
you're playing with your life !
you better ask for a ml6 .
no , really .
detective chiu !
sorry , mr. ken .
this gentleman claimed to be from tak ying sauna .
he said he must say something very important to detective chiu in person .
hey !
how's the assignment coming along?
detective chiu !
i've told you to wait outside for me , man !
i better give this to you personally , sir .
i did great this time , didn't l?
not bad , huh?
janis , show this gentleman out .
sir , this way .
hey , didn't you say you've got some ...
v stuff , some real powerful shit?
can i see it?
sure !
ask teresa to show you around .
your company has quite a setup !
lots of staff !
were you mr. ken's classmate back in cambridge?
which field were you in?
it's true that we're old classmates ... back in elementary school .
but it's quite a famous school .
it's all my old man's fault .
i couldn't get in high school because he didn't get the janitor job .
wow !
this hdtv tank looks real !
such high resolution !
do you need to feed them with electric worms?
you can still laugh even though it's not funny .
any progress from the police investigation?
we believe that the murders are all related to brotherhood of technology .
mr. ken , are you sure you haven't receive any solicitation from this group?
this doesn't make sense .
all members of this organization are renowned scientists .
are you saying that i'm lying?
that's not what i meant .
he's a genius .
many call him the modern freud .
he's an outstanding psychiatrist .
he's also the head of a scientific consortium .
we suspect that he is the leader of brotherhood of technology .
i don't think this group is after money , because billy conners is already one of the top ten billionaires .
we're both scientists , but i am a lot poorer !
i've decided on tai pang .
besides him , i don't need anybody else to protect me .
ok . lf you have so much faith in detective chiu , we are more than happy to have him protect you .
lf you need anything else , just call us .
have you noticed anything odd in sun's behavior after that?
after what?
after adele's death !
nothing odd .
everything seems normal .
did he skip work at all?
then why did he go sailing yesterday?
it's normal to go sailing on sundays .
think about it .
lf your boyfriend just passed away , wouldn't you just stay home and cry your heart out?
would you still go to work at all?
he's being normal in a most abnormal way .
janis .
yes?
do you have any painkillers?
sure .
boss .
after i'm tired of panadol , i'll try aspirin .
why not try some chocolate?
it's not healthy to take so many pills .
you're so silly !
this is not instant coffee .
you need to use a coffeepot !
wait !
you need a filter too .
thanks .
let me help you .
takes me forever just to make a cup of coffee .
no kidding .
ls that enough?
are you new here?
yes .
today is only my third day .
what is your name?
my name is adele .
a d e l e , with a stroke above the last e .
my french teacher chose the name for me .
very annoying , isn't it?
very .
by the way , i can make you coffee when i make one for my boss later .
who's your boss?
his last name is ken .
then you can just make one for your boss .
mr. ken .
so ... you are adele?
you are mr. ken .
mr. ken , i'll bring the coffee to your room when it's ready .
fine .
thanks .
mr. ken .
what is it , mr. ken?
this is for you .
are you free for dinner tonight?
i'm sorry , but i have classes tonight .
how about tomorrow night?
fine .
i'm leaving .
bye .
everything here is firewall protected to prevent our computer systems from hackers breaking in .
just seeing all these rolls of wiring gives me the creeps .
teresa .
clarence .
ls mr. ken back yet?
he's in his office .
let me introduce .
this is clarence , our systems director .
he's also mr. ken's classmate .
how do you do?
this is detective chiu , mr. ken's bodyguard .
ls mr. ken in trouble?
nothing major .
so you've known him for quite some time?
yes , ever since our university days .
do you recall him offending any person lately?
sure , tons of them .
once our vod becomes popular , many computer guys would need a career change .
have you noticed anything unusual about him lately?
well , there had been some minor mistakes on his recent orders , and mr. ken seldom makes mistakes .
i'll have to go find mr. ken .
ok .
thanks .
anything else to see?
let's get this over with .
something that will blow you away .
what is it?
vod .
once you've installed our video on demand system , your home tv would turn from one way into a two way communication .
miss wong .
so what's the fuss about vod?
it's just a tv set !
just listen to her .
it will allow you to watch the movie you want just by entering a code .
this is nothing new .
you can register by phone and then follow the movie time slot .
what you're referring to is limited by the time slot .
with vod , you can watch it whenever you like .
it's two different things .
so stop interrupting her , dumbass !
furthermore , with vod movies , you can fast forward , pause , and rewind , just like watching it on videotape .
besides movies , you can also surf the net , do grocery shopping or shop for other things online .
lf combined with the use of a smart card , you can even transfer your money from your bank .
it's very convenient .
you'd need a big bunch of wires for so many functions .
it's not convenient at all !
a man like you can be so ignorant .
all you need is a phone line .
i'm just talking to myself , woman .
mind your own business .
don't pretend to be an expert .
how can a phone line that thin carry so many functions?
ask the professionals if you don't believe me !
actually , this lady is right .
the greatest breakthrough of our vod is that it uses just one single fiber optic line .
see?
even she agrees that you don't know anything !
why , you ... you ...
elaine , please continue .
so uneducated !
mr. ken pages us to a meeting in the war room .
war room? ls that a place for wars?
almost .
this is where we do our research and analysis .
only a few people have access .
you've met clarence .
this is kim .
he has several doctorate degrees .
i can also read your fortune .
i'm good at that .
i'm tc .
i used to be in pathology .
but not anymore .
ls orange juice ok?
sun , have you offended anyone lately?
there'll soon be many .
once we launch our vod , every telecommunication company will be affected .
such as?
such as networks , video distributors , and lnternet service providers .
especially lsp's .
my feelings exactly .
lf someone wants mr. ken dead ,
i suppose it would be those internet or software development firms .
that's a lot of people !
not really .
only the top five firms would feel most threatened by mr. ken .
teresa , search the net for the list of top level managers from these firms .
sure .
it can't be that serious .
vod is television .
it's different from computers .
they're not that different .
tv is family entertainment .
but lnternet is for one individual .
it's like salt and sugar .
would you substitute salt for sugar?
besides , there're bankers , doctors , and chemists among the victims .
they may not be just pinpointing me .
so?
so what? lf the murderers can kill by spontaneous combustion , then there's nothing i can do to prevent them from killing me .
why waste your time thinking about this?
are you that smart?
sorry .
what is it?
nothing .
let's eat !
are you sure you can cook?
why not?
my specialty is not studying , but making instant noodles .
i was one of the " ten best lnstant noodles " winners in college .
then you'll do the cooking from now on .
but they withdrew the prize afterwards .
they said that i cheated .
let's get married .
you're nuts .
the more reason to get married .
hey , don't move around .
i don't want to , that's why i want to get married .
come on .
you will regret it !
i won't know that until after the wedding .
fine !
but first , you have to gain 10 pounds .
no problem .
i want to spend our honeymoon in prague .
no problem .
i'll book the tickets tomorrow .
also , i'll only marry a guy who has an afro hairdo .
like that?
close .
forget it then .
let's continue .
damn you !
no need to guess .
those are the prague tickets .
i've gained 3 pounds , and i've booked the flights .
as for the hairdo ...
i've got a sample .
the stylist should know what to do !
do you have any vacation left?
of course !
that's right .
senior staff like you have flexible time off .
junior staff like me don't have such luxuries .
that's right .
what should we do?
we'll have to wait .
i'll return the tickets .
don't you dare !
how long is the trip?
2 weeks?
you've even got a small dock down there .
that kills me .
that's really cute .
i've always felt that your house is like a morgue .
metal everywhere .
some wood would help .
roundtrip tickets for two to prague?
it's about to expire .
return them !
why did you leave them here?
don't waste them .
don't touch my stuff .
better get a refund soon .
might as well use the money on dinner .
don't touch my stuff !
why are you so upset?
she's been dead for so long .
why hang on to them?
for decoration?
they're not even pretty !
why do you care?
why did you ask me to come here?
what the hell do you need me for?
i'm useless to you .
your duty is to protect me .
are you crazy??
protect you?
i don't know jack shit about your hi tech , body explosion stuff .
i'm just a cop !
you think i'm a scientist? !
ask those ml6 guys to protect you then !
i'm only here to chat with you , man !
you just want to die !
that's easy .
just bang your head on the wall .
no need to wait til you explode !
why drag me into this?
lf you want to die , do it on your own .
you should know what i mean .
are you hungry?
i just don't know what to do with you !
of course i'm hungry .
i haven't eaten all day .
what would you like?
i'll bring you to a nice place .
do you trust me?
the vendors are still here .
they'll be gone if you don't come here often enough .
what do you want?
hurry up with your orders .
combination noodles .
shrimp noodles for me .
no onions .
hey !
i know you two !
it took you long enough !
you need new glasses !
eat some more .
go away !!
get lost !
no , no ... l can't take your money .
careful .
it's hot !
let's eat .
wow !
this is really spicy !
i thought you always wanted extra spicy .
you can't take this now?
you could when you were younger !
hey , i didn't order sausage !
it's on the house .
then at least give me more than just two slices .
what a miser !
you haven't changed a bit , especially that big mouth of yours .
did you finish school?
what are you up to now?
lnstalling antennas .
that bad?
no wonder you look so sad .
nobody uses antennas nowadays .
even i don't use it .
don't you worry .
those antennas are still big in china and vietnam .
plenty of chances , young man !
combination noodles !
can't you wait a minute?
why not tell him how much you really have?
eat your noodles !
where were we?
you were lecturing him .
do continue .
he's really depressed .
right .
it doesn't matter what you do , as long as you are happy .
just take a look at my noodle place .
many rich folks come to eat here .
whenever i'm off , they'll have to settle for those wonton noodles next door .
those noodles are just plain shit !
where's your daughter?
don't even talk about her .
but you do have a daughter ...
i said , don't even talk about her !
young people nowadays ...
at least you two still remember me .
nostalgia is a good thing !
don't look so sad .
your noodles?
my treat !
what about mine?
of course you have to pay , big mouth !
i have to get back to work .
this world stinks more and more by the day .
not as bad as your mouth .
maybe , but it has a sweet taste .
want to try?
that's it .
smile and you won't blow up .
motherfucker !
pay up !
pay up !
why won't you pay up?
none of your business !
police !
freeze !
police !
stop fighting !
thanks .
what's with you?
you and that ml6 dog are always following us .
where is he now?
you think it's easy to follow you around?
but we are really concerned about mr. ken's safety .
maybe you're worried about my competence even more .
i'm watching him , but you're watching me .
do you want me to screw up in front of ml6?
but you did screw up , didn't you?
try not to protect your image all the time .
yes , madam .
you're the boss .
madam , you're here !
your lab report is already out .
have you got it?
i've got it .
thanks .
what report?
were you not feeling well?
hey ... what lab report?
there is no sign of fracture or hemorrhage in your skull .
lf that's the case , can i be discharged?
lf you stay one more night , we can make sure that there is no future damage to your brain .
we'll arrange to have this patient transferred to another ward .
just stay here and rest .
it's for your protection .
but i really want to go home .
please be patient .
get some rest .
hey , you .
got into a fight?
did it hurt?
no .
did you throw up?
no .
then you should be fine .
you can leave .
i get hit on the head a lot .
my mom said i'll be fine as long as i don't throw up .
it's only pain .
you'll be alright .
relax .
what's your name?
my last name is ken .
i asked for your name , not just your last name !
what's wrong with you?
sorry .
my name is tit sun .
my name is brother chuen .
how do you do?
how do you do?
why did they tie you up?
lsn't that obvious enough?
i'm crazy .
i bite people .
they want to get chucky .
so i bit them .
who's chucky?
chucky is very famous .
he barks really loud .
all other dogs are scared of him .
you look ugly when you laugh .
let me tell you something really funny .
my mother lost a bet .
she often said that she would live longer than i would .
but this time , i won .
she went to bed 2 days ago and never woke up .
the doctor told me she's dead .
do you miss her?
of course .
but i can only miss her for a while each day .
i'm really busy , you know .
i have to check on those hawkers at the market everyday for fraud .
and i have to make sure that cars won't hit the kids when they cross .
i even have to feed chucky .
damn !
i wonder if chucky ate breakfast this morning?
have you got a girlfriend?
yes , a while ago .
there is a nurse here .
she's really pretty .
she wears a mickey mouse watch .
my mom said that i'm all grown up now .
i really would like to start a relationship .
what is it then?
nothing .
then why did you come here for a lab test?
just for fun?
come on , tell me about it .
x ray reveals a black spot in my stomach .
the doctor suspected cancer , so he took some samples for analysis .
what did the report say?
it can't be cancer .
you don't even smoke or drink !
you should be fine .
don't be like this .
the doctor said that the black spot is only food that's not digested .
he said i should cut down on pickled eggs .
you had me all worried !
i apologize , mr. ken .
we'll transfer him now .
there's no need .
we got along pretty well .
that's right .
we're friends .
your name is sunny .
i forgot my business cards .
this is my business card .
call me if you need any help .
why would i need help?
i'm the one who help others .
lf anyone bullies you here , just say that you know me .
i'm notorious around here .
thank you so much .
you're too corny .
i'm not talking to you anymore !
are you transferring me to another room or not?
right .
let's go .
sorry , mr. ken .
remember .
just tell them that you know me .
sun , did you bump your head?
does it hurt?
what is it?
have you seen adele?
what?
lmpossible !
adele was just here !
it's just your delusion .
no !
i even felt her touch .
she was standing right there !
alright .
you get some sleep .
i'll call the doctor .
lie down .
this card was not here before !
ask the hospital staff if they saw anyone leaving it here .
how could this be?
this address is top secret .
that's where mr. sato is .
sato? !
the one who did the biology l . c. research?
yes .
it was he who told us about brotherhood of technology .
he's under ml6's protection .
it's impossible that anyone else would have known this address .
help !
help !!
madam !
they were never out of this room .
and there's nothing here .
what's the burning smell?
i don't know .
it's the smell of human flesh !
did you see mr. sato?
he's gone !
how could he just disappear?
spontaneous combustion again?
doesn't look like it .
lf it is , the people beside him would still be alive .
well?
human explosion again?
i'll take a look .
sam !
please let me go , dr. ken .
sorry .
please wait .
lvy , let me do the forensics this time .
kim has already called someone from the hong kong university .
dr. ken , you should follow the rules .
james asked us to do the forensics .
but james is not here yet .
madam , this will look bad for our department .
do you want the truth or not?
dr. yip !
dr. wong !
dr. lau !
so are you the expert or are we the experts?
of course you are .
you were all my teachers .
i'll give you a report in two days .
how about this , dr. yip?
let me check it out first .
i'll let you examine after i'm done .
then what's there left for us to examine?
our objective is to preserve the crime scene's original state .
i taught you that !
sam , give us a hand .
coming !
according to the first witness and our own observations , the door was locked when the incident happened .
there were two corpses in the room .
but mr. sato had vanished .
we found a large sum of cash and his credit cards .
also , the suit which mr. sato was last seen wearing was scattered all over the place .
but there were no signs of struggle .
this proves that the probability of a forced abduction was very low .
lf he has really left the place , it must be either voluntary , or he must have been unconscious .
as for the autopsy report on the two ml6 members , the cause of death was heart failure .
all the other major organs simply failed simultaneously .
i've never done an autopsy on a cooked corpse before .
they were microwaved to 80 % well done .
they smelled like bbq pork when i cut them open .
you don't have to be that detailed .
what else?
since the bodies were microwaved from the inside , all internal organs were cooked .
therefore , there were no bacteria to determine time of death .
the skin ...
can you just skip to your conclusion?
even though i couldn't find any evidence from the corpses ,
i could still estimate their time of death to be around 10 to 10 : 07 pm .
without any evidence , how could you be so sure?
i imagined putting a 180lb piece of meat in a huge microwave oven , and calculated the time it takes to cook the meat .
as simple as that !
our satellite also ceased to receive signals for 15 seconds at 10 : 06 : 32 pm .
it closely matches the time of death .
we've also checked the oven .
surprisingly , its microwave power exceeded its original design by ten times .
how could that be?
i'd like to know that myself .
this doesn't fit any scientific logic .
we found a large amount of ashes and crystallized substances at the scene .
from the analysis , they contain 3 elements .
they are organic compound , protein , and the third?
minerals .
are you telling me that the japanese did not disappear?
correct !
theoretically , add 80 % of water , and " it " will turn back into a human being .
what could've done this?
beats me !
lf you dehydrate a person , he should only turn into a dry corpse at the most .
but now we are seeing an actual , dissolved substance .
just like being shot dead by laser guns in a cartoon .
hey man , i'm only kidding .
he's referring to assault satellites .
there are now more than 800 satellites orbiting the earth .
we only know the true usage of half of them .
the rest are all classified military satellites .
my knowledge is that the u. s. government has already tested laser and particle beam from these satellites successfully .
it's not too difficult to check .
we can match the time of the incident with the positions of the satellites hovering above hong kong at that time .
dr. yip , i still don't understand .
i've handled a lot of crime scenes .
normally , when there are multiple bodies in a common crime scene , their cause of death is usually the same .
so why did the japanese dissolve into ashes , but not the other two guys?
one exploded , and the other turned into ashes .
what about the other two guys?
james didn't say anything about their deaths .
actually , even james himself didn't know .
one guy's lranian , and the other was russian .
their cause of death was never announced .
why does killing people have to be this fancy?
maybe they are experimenting .
i think someone is trying to show off .
mr. sato might know more .
but he is dead .
our computers have always communicated with his .
we can try breaking into his system .
a break in?
that's illegal !
do you have a better suggestion?
this is too big for us to handle .
cops !
cops !
cops !
cops , gator !
are you mr. yao?
cld .
what ...
these are just games !
no x rated stuff !
you can arrest me , but please don't beat me up .
we need your help .
sir , please don't play games with me .
how can small potatoes like us help you?
but you are gator , aren't you?
are you crazy?
gator my ass !
all i have are dead cpu's .
uncle , you can stop pretending .
i brought them here .
you little piece of shit !
you betrayed me !!
you're asking for a beating !
fine !
you can forget about descrambling all those japanese porno discs of yours !
you little shit !
mr. yao , i urged kim to bring me here .
i'm ken tit sun .
but you are so young !
you're good !
you did something even the japanese and americans couldn't .
transmitting video with just one single phone line .
smart !
you are truly a smart ass !
i need your help to save my life .
save your life?
this japanese system is known for its superb firewalls .
that's why we need your help , uncle .
lf you can break into his system , you'll become a legend overnight .
even the japanese will be running scared when they hear your name .
you are running scared now !
you're always bragging about your hacking skills .
you try breaking in then .
we have the technology , but we don't have the expertise like you do .
that's true .
i can't match you when it comes to building things , but when it comes to breaking in ...
hey , wait a minute .
this is illegal .
you've always been breaking the law .
we only break small laws .
we don't break big ones .
i don't want handcuffs on my wrists .
madam , it's your turn to speak .
our main objective is to protect mr. ken .
we'll turn our backs on anything else .
right .
she saw nothing .
thanks .
i must really learn from gator this time .
i have one condition though .
i want a picture with you , so i can hang it on my storefront .
sure .
ok .
andy , you handle the hardware .
i'll need 20 terminal linkups , the fastest modems and printers .
you need to help me put together a hard disk of at least 20 gigs .
because i don't know how much memory their system has .
you help me copy these 20 hacker programs into the terminals .
the rest of you will help me with the cables and monitors , ok?
ok !
any questions?
no .
dismiss !
done?
all set !
lf the correct password is not entered within the first 15 minutes , the firewall will activate immediately .
lf we try to break in manually , it could take forever .
it's easy because that japanese was a scientist .
scientists have a logical way of thinking .
the same goes for their passwords .
also , check out his surroundings and what he likes .
you can't go wrong .
what if his computer randomly chose the password for him?
we have three pcs working on that right now .
wish us luck !
everyone , on your mark .
set ... go !
i'm out of codes !
what's that?
something about japanese baseball .
we've used up their usernames !
keep entering some more !
the machine just hangs !
porn stars?
let me !
there goes my reputation !
hey , check this out .
what is it?
what the hell did you enter?
don't know .
i just randomly picked a phrase from here .
the final war between good and evil "?
these are all buddhist scriptures .
nostradamus .
what does it mean?
he was a very famous french prophet .
he predicted armageddon .
could this be a prank from sato?
these are all from the bible , the koran , and the sutra .
but they all share the same theme , and that is the religion's prediction for armageddon .
buddhism emphasizes the idea of a beginning and an end , that there must be an end before there is a beginning .
sounds like karma , but also sounds like armageddon .
the buddhist sutra reveals that the great wheel will turn once every 2, 000 years .
each time it turns , earth will encounter a big disaster .
and it's now 1997 .
aren't you scared , pal?
ln japan , the sun moon god also talks about armageddon .
the gods will descend from the heavens after 3, 000 years to destroy not only the world , but also the spiritual world .
ln the koran , a large portion is devoted to armageddon .
it even predicts precisely that in july of 1999 ,
the king of horror will descend upon the earth .
the bible's book of revelations said that there are seven signs that precede armageddon .
maybe it has something to do with our case .
the first sign the antichrist will appear in the name of satan .
on that day , the fiery mountains will sink into the oceans .
one third of the sea will turn into blood , and one third of the creatures in the sea will die .
even one third of all ships will be destroyed .
some believe that sadaam hussein is the antichrist .
and the persian gulf war matches the scenarios in revelations .
the second sign a star that burns like a torch will descend from the sky , and fall into 1/ 3 of the world's rivers .
the star is called " wormwood " .
the river will become bitter , and because of that , many will die .
wormwood " is a kind of herbs , but it's also known by its nickname ,
chernobyl " .
the same name as the soviet nuclear power plant that suffered a meltdown .
the third sign the reappearance of the kingdom of babylon .
the layout of babylon is very similar to that of modern day europe .
and i'm sure you all know about the unification talks .
the fourth sign the reappearance of the temple of jerusalem .
remember mr. anderson?
his will stated that 50 billion british pounds under his name will be automatically donated to jerusalem's temple restoration efforts .
noah's ark will also reappear .
as for mr. sato , he was dedicated to collecting dna from each and every living creatures on earth .
he didn't want any of them to become extinct .
then ...
it's just like the noah's ark theory , isn't it?
the sixth sign there will be a big earthquake .
the moon will turn red , and all the stars will fall .
the seventh sign " who does not believe in me will turn to me when the day comes " .
on judgement day , everything without the seal of god will all be destroyed .
five of the seven signs had already appeared .
you can say that chernobyl and saddam hussein are just coincidences .
but the rest seems to have been done by man .
could this be the work of some mad scientist , using the bible as an excuse?
think so?
would someone be that dumb as to kill himself by creating armageddon?
that's why i said he's mad .
how can we read a madman's mind?
are you guys scientists or what?
all this superstitious babbling !
do you know " feng shui " too?
i need it for my home .
sure .
give me your date of birth .
there are many things that can't be explained with science .
there's no point in arguing .
i think the answer lies on this card .
although i can't be sure how this card appears ,
i am very sure that adele is dead .
so what?
they used a ghost to give me the card .
what?
a ghost?
she touched my head with her hand .
i could actually feel her body warmth .
i tried to catch her , but she simply vanished .
did you actually touch her?
no .
but i don't believe it's a dream .
i don't think you can feel body warmth in dreams .
mr. ken , you are a scientist yourself .
do you believe in ghosts?
i don't know .
that's why i need your help .
besides this incident , have you ever seen adele in your dreams?
yes .
how many times?
many .
i think it's just pressure from your work .
steve , don't give me this work pressure bullshit .
don't tell me i'm having illusions because i miss adele too much .
even if they are , then how do you explain the card?
do you think i made it up?
i don't even know how to make up things like that !
calm down .
i can't help you if you act like this .
rest a bit , please .
well?
i still think that he is mixing reality with his illusions .
have a drink .
what does that mean?
ls he losing his mind?
he is just being hyper .
urbanites are a bunch of nervous wrecks .
and the card?
how do you explain that?
even he himself can't be sure it's adele who left the card .
the card's origin and adele's appearance are two separate issues .
do you guys really believe that he saw adele's ghost?
tai pang ...
say it .
don't come over !
don't be scared , you all .
don't come near me !
i've got a gun !
it's me , tai pang .
put your gun down .
it's me !
sun .
watch the door .
lvy !
be careful .
i don't know what she is !
why are you here?
i don't know .
i really don't know .
do you remember the past?
when's your birthday?
june 20th .
and mine?
july 21st .
remember your first words to me?
you're so silly !
now what?
does this mean we're all urban psychos?
sunny baby , i am adele .
i miss you so much .
did adele ever call you " sunny baby "?
this is not your girlfriend .
not her .
fine , you can go .
you're in the wrong body .
but i'm not done .
yes , you are .
your money's outside .
thanks .
we'll pay you outside .
fine , as long as i get paid .
i've told you this wouldn't work .
you're wasting money .
it's just a try .
mr. ken , he's the spiritual advisor recommended by my friend .
this house is really haunted .
hey , peter .
when did you become a psychic?
wow !
turns out this house is haunted by cops !
sorry , detective chiu !
i'm going !
it's been a long day .
you must all be tired .
go home .
come on !
maybe all these people here scared her off .
i'll find you an even more powerful psychic later .
how come the name is changed? !
she's been here .
tickets to prague in 2 days?
why is my name on it?
i think someone wants us to go to prague .
this is too spooky for me .
i'm not going !
i'm telling you .
you can count me out .
whatever .
don't you talk to me like that !
i'm really not going !
how come it's so cold? !
my toes are all frozen !
what the hell did i do wrong?
why am i here in prague?
i said i wasn't coming !!
why did you do this to me?
adele and i thought of getting married here .
therefore , it's not odd for her to meet me here .
you think i haven't done my research?
i've checked the travel agency .
they said the tickets were booked under your company's name .
maybe someone in your office is pulling a prank on you .
could it be janis?
there are so many personnel in my company .
anyone could've used our name and booked the tickets .
i trust janis more than i trust you .
then why didn't you ask janis to come? !
do we have to check each and every church here in prague?
adele really liked the churches here .
why can't she pick the tropics or some place warmer?
why prague?
here's your hot drink .
it's freezing !
exactly !
what the hell are we here for??
you , maybe .
but why me??
she's not even my girl !
don't get mad .
after the drink , we'll start from the first church again .
give it a chance .
it shouldn't be hard to find a chinese girl here ...
you mean a chinese ghost !
you'll have better luck at the cemetery !
cemetery? !
you're right .
i know ... now i know why she wants you here .
i'm just kidding , man .
come on .
i'm only kidding !
me and my big mouth !
there's hardly any ghost here .
can we go now?
let's walk some more .
how about this?
we'll wait here till they close the gates .
you're kidding !
i can barely walk .
there's no way i can just stand and wait .
jog on the same spot then .
adele , if you really want to see me , just reveal yourself .
hey !
you can't take off your hat here .
sorry .
hey !
watch out !
you almost got run over .
why are you sighing?
it's gorgeous here .
no need to sigh for that .
i sigh because i'm with you .
pretty place like this is for a man and a woman .
lf only lvy could be here .
fine .
we'll book our return flight tomorrow .
no need .
we still have so many places to go .
there's no hurry .
besides , i haven't tried table dance yet .
perhaps adele likes neither churches nor cemeteries .
maybe she likes table dance too !
let's take a picture , just to prove that we've been here .
can you get the geese and the ducks too?
hurry up .
adele !
take your jacket off !!
i'm doing it !
hurry !!
i've never bought any women's clothes before .
so don't yell at me if you don't like them .
you are one hungry ghost !
i haven't eaten for a long time .
do you remember being hit by a car here?
yes , but then , it felt like i was asleep , and i even dreamt about you .
do you remember visiting me?
of course !
you even pointed your gun at me .
you chicken shit .
hey , i was scared .
you're a ghost !
i'm not a ghost !
drink this .
it'll warm you up .
you know i don't drink .
why are you testing me?
but i ...
i just cannot accept the fact that you ...
you've been cremated , but now you're here .
don't you want to see me?
of course !
you have a new girlfriend .
no , i don't !
be honest .
tell me the truth .
i can take it .
just tell me !
no , i really don't .
you're still lying? !
i can see it in your eyes .
do you have a new girl?
ask him .
you ask him whether i have one .
i don't want to ask him .
i'm asking you !
you better clear this up .
listen to me .
are you lying?
i swear !
i swear !
ok?
that's it !
she's definitely your girl .
definitely !
are we really getting married here?
do you like it?
as long as you won't regret it .
of course i won't !
you two are making me sick .
are you scared?
you can go on if you are .
i'm getting goose bumps .
call lvy and tell her to come too .
i've called her already !
she's verifying her fingerprints in hong kong right now .
she's really the boring workaholic type .
not as boring as a nerd like you !
what is it?
this is too strange .
lf i tell this to anyone , they're going to say i'm crazy .
doesn't all this seem like a dream to you?
doesn't matter .
the most important thing is that she's really back .
right?
hey , come over here .
what's up?
this is so pretty !
look !
where?
i don't see it .
you asked for it !
you're going to be broke this time .
lsn't this beautiful?
adele !!
wait !
adele !!
calm down !!
are you crazy??
get back here !
just let me go !
get up !
dr. ken , don't worry .
adele will be back .
the most important thing is that you know she's real .
adele?
where is she??
so you're the one behind everything?
everything is god's will .
i'm just his messenger .
god? !
what god?
besides god , who else can be this powerful?
i give you this ring .
wear it when you're back in hong kong .
can't move?
i'm afraid you might get too excited .
go to hell !
you don't excite me !
i've always said that foreigners are the craziest of all !
get him !
let me kick his ass !!
why take her away from me and shatter my heart?
and in a lapse of time , bid farewell to happiness?
my feeble hands were unable to comfort my broken heart
hard to let go , with only tears in my eyes
how did this happen?
how can i solve this mystery?
the burden too heavy , the pain too much
a regret that i cannot face
never thought i was that close when i lost my love ...
take a look at this .
some i can name and some i can't .
cost me a month's salary .
this is powerful shit .
you will be safe with this .
besides , i'm with you .
don't worry .
i'll go by myself tonight .
i didn't get it .
come again?
i feel a sense of danger here .
but i really want to see adele again , so ...
so what?
are you giving up now?
that billy conners is just another con man !
he's an authority figure in psychology .
he studies esp .
so?
he's a high class con man then !
then how do you explain adele?
how would i know?
you're the scientist and you're asking me? !
because even i can't explain it myself .
don't be scared .
lf he does anything funny ,
i'll beat the shit out of him .
don't you worry .
you don't understand .
you really don't !
you've got lvy .
you've never lost your most beloved .
i really want to see adele again .
what does that mean??
call me when you need me , and kick me out when you don't need me anymore? !
who do you think i am?
a call girl??
that's not what i meant !
sorry .
am i interrupting?
of course not .
we're just chatting .
boss , do you want to join our party?
no , i'm not going .
lots of good food there !
you guys have fun tonight .
alright then .
we're going .
janis .
walk tai pang to the door for me .
tai pang !
merry christmas .
i'll wish you a merry christmas if i still see you tomorrow .
ken .
i said i'm not going .
have fun tonight .
i'm not talking about that party .
welcome to our party .
come on .
he's here .
hi , clarence .
hello !
ken , welcome .
johnny? !
surprised?
there are lots of familiar faces here .
hello , ken !
we knew you'd join us sooner or later .
welcome .
where's adele?
she's fine .
don't you worry .
let the ceremony begins .
drink this , dr. ken .
i don't understand .
you still don't?
i've told you .
i'm here to welcome you .
ls murder part of your welcome too?
they died to prove god's power .
so you admit to killing all those people?
that's all i need .
pollce !
freeze !
freeze !
you know how excited i am .
chuck , bring him here .
watch out for his tricks .
tai pang , where's your " stick "?
one of them must work !
tell me .
where's adele?
why?
why don't you believe me?
it is god's will ... lt is god's will ...
tell me .
tell me where adele is !
you tell me where she is !
why didn't you believe him?
he cured my terminal cancer in just one day .
hey , wait .
thanks .
what?
are you afraid he's not dead?
maybe he'll resurrect .
did you regret it?
not at all .
he's a con man and a killer .
but he's known to perform miracles .
where's tit sun?
he wants to sit around longer .
marry me?
don't be silly .
you never know what will happen tomorrow .
why?
why can't i accept anything beyond science?
ls it because i'm too smart , or just plain ignorant?
stop the car !
tell them to go back !
call the ambulance !
what's that?
lf you believe me , i will not disappoint you .
i'll have a surprise for you .
your friend is a real pain in the butt .
why do you care so much about life and death?
tai pang !
get out of here !!
actually , they're no big deal .
are you nuts?
are you??
so you like killing?
klll me then !
klll me !!!
pain all over !
so that's how it feels to have a hole in your chest !
sun , it is so clear to me now .
the brothers and sisters in this group are all carefully chosen by him to assist you .
what exactly are you trying to say?
you won't understand .
he gives you a quota to select a group of people and accomplish the last mission .
last mission? !
yeah !
what is it?
armageddon !
the moon turning red and the earthquakes ...
all the signs have appeared .
there's only one sign left now .
once a non believer like you starts to have faith , then it's done !
it's easy for geniuses like you to create armageddon .
how many do i need to choose?
1 , 500 .
you're saying that only 1 , 500 people will survive armageddon? !
doesn't matter !
it's the end of the world !
what's the difference between life and death?
you and the remaining 1 , 500 people will turn into gods and recreate a perfect world .
by then , the new world will have no war , no starvation , no disease , not even triads .
everybody just sings karaoke everyday .
lsn't that wonderful?
and you , you'll be our leader .
lsn't it cool?
i can choose whomever i want?
of course !
you're his son , and i'm your buddy .
remember to save me a spot , ok?
just say the word , and lvy will resurrect , just like adele .
why are you so clear minded all of a sudden?
how could you understand the whole picture?
it's a miracle !
even now , you still don't believe in him?
i'm not saying that i don't believe in him , but ...
it's the truth !
haven't you heard of the truth?
then , is the truth right or wrong?
you ... you still have to ask this?
survival of the fittest is the law of nature , and that's also the truth .
ls that right or wrong?
you said that , out of millions of people , only 1 , 500 will survive armageddon .
do you think that's right?
but they deserve to die !
look what they've done to the world !
all that pollution !
even if you don't create armageddon , the world will end sooner or later !
lf he really wants them to change , why can't he just come out and say it?
i guarantee that they will believe him and change ...
so what's your point??
you're not tai pang .
he wouldn't ask me like that .
he knows i won't do it .
why can't you understand?
this is already predestined .
the world can change for the better .
just like you can change into tai pang , right?
you'll lose adele .
i was dead already .
we haven't lost anything .
besides , it's almost the end of the world .
no point for me to come back .
someone will do this !
even if you don't , someone else will !
find someone else then .
i don't want to be another judas .
you will both go to hell !
go to hell?
it's already armageddon .
what's so scary about hell?
we'll go together .
fool !
you're such a fool !!
god !
please execute your last judgement !
pain all over !
so that's how it feels to have a hole in your chest !
damn !
why did you hit me so hard? !
are you tai pang?
who else could i be?
your dad??
it's like a nightmare !
good .
now everything is ...
don't come near .
it's alright now .
how do you know?
i'm already dead .
what if i vanish again?
don't come any closer !
i'm afraid i'll vanish again .
promise me ...
promise me you won't miss me anymore?
adele , i ...
just stay there and listen !
there may not be another chance .
lf i do disappear , promise me you'll live a good life .
i don't want to see you sad .
you only live once .
i was already dead .
i've already earned my extra time by seeing you again .
no , you won't .
you won't vanish again .
listen to me ...
that's what we thought when we were in prague .
just promise that you won't miss me .
i know i won't miss you !
i think i'll go to heaven or get reincarnated .
i promise you .
i'll live well .
i'll go out , and i'll date other girls , alright?
but i won't let you cook instant noodles for your new girlfriends .
i'm really afraid i'll vanish again !
no , you won't .
i'll never leave you .
no man is that devoted .
sure there is .
i'm proud to present the most devoted husband , ken tit sun .
you're bad !
lvy ! lvy !
i'm here !
i thought it was armageddon?
how come you get to have all the fun?
i think if we had accepted his mission , then that would've been the end of the world .
so it was a test?
what kind of a naughty god is that?
he didn't say .
but i guess they're all the same .
anyway , just don't do anything that would hurt other people .
does marrying lvy count as hurting others?
i better reconsider .
forget it .
you're going to hell for sure !
yeah right !
lf i can choose , i'll definitely choose armageddon .
fine , fine .
i've told you .
everything would be alright .
you're so brave !
really?
my mom said that about me all the time !
the health department is stunned that
christmas was the first day in hong kong history where there were no deaths .
they believe it was a miracle that the 4 critically injured survive .
as for the strange lightshow at the hong kong stadium , the government is at a loss for explanation ...
