so , you do like it , don't you?
no , no .
i do , i do .

we go out ... and back in .
and then we go out ... and back in .
and then one more time ... out and back in .
and sometimes , if you want to do it four times ...
dad ...

it's his first time at school .
he was born with it .
we call it his lucky fin .
dad ...

especially when i twirl them like this .
i'm h 2 o intolerant .
ah choo !
i'm obnoxious .

that means you , jimmy .
aw , man !
aw , man !
bye , nemo !
bye , dad !
bye , son !
be safe .
you're doing pretty well for a first timer .

this does not concern you , kids ... and you're lucky i don't tell your parents .
you know you can't swim well .
i can swim fine , dad , ok?
no , it's not ok .
you shouldn't be near here .
ok , i was right .
you'll start school in a year or two .
no , dad !
just because you're scared of the ocean ...
clearly , you're not ready ...
clearly , you're not ready ... and you're not coming back until you are .
you think you can do these things ... but you just can't , nemo !
i hate you .
there's
nothing to see .
gather .
over there .
excuse me .
ls there anything i can do?
i am a scientist , sir .
ls there any problem?
i'm sorry .
i didn't mean to interrupt things .
he isn't a good swimmer , and it's a little too soon ... for him to be out here unsupervised .
i can assure you , he's quite safe with me .
i'm sure he is , but you have a large class ... and he can get lost from sight if you're not looking .
i'm not saying you're not looking .
i'm not saying you're not looking .
oh , my gosh !
nemo's swimming out to sea !

sharkbait !
ooh ... ba ba do .
sharkbait's one of us now , agreed?
agreed .
we can't send him to his death .
darla's coming in five days .
so , what are we going to do?
i'll tell you what we're gonna do ... we're gonna get him out of here .
we'll help him escape .
escape?

why should this be any different?
why should this be any different?
because we've got him .
me?
you see that filter?
yeah .
you're the only one who can get in and out of that thing .
we need you to take a pebble inside there ... and jam the gears .
you do that , and this tank's gonna get ... filthier and filthier by the minute .
pretty soon , the dentist'll have to clean the tank ... and when he does , he'll take us out of the tank ... put us in individual baggies ... then we'll roll ourselves down the counter ... out the window , off the awning ... into the bushes , across the street ... and into the harbor !
it's foolproof .
who's with me?
aye !
aye !
i think you're nuts .
no offense , kid , but you're not the best swimmer .
he's fine .
he can do this .

one at a time !
mr. fish , did you die?
sorry , i was a little vague on the details .
so , where are you going?
you see , my son was taken .
my son was taken away from me .
no way .
what happened?
no , no , kids .
i don't want to talk about it .
aww !
please?
please?
well , ok .
i live on this reef a long , long way from here .
this is gonna be good .
i can tell .
and my son nemo ...
see , he was mad at me .
and maybe he wouldn't have done it ... if i hadn't been so tough on him .
i don't know .
anyway , he swam out in the open water to this boat ... and when he was out there , these divers appeared ... and i tried to stop them , but the boat was too fast .
so , we swam out in the ocean to follow them ...
they couldn't stop 'em .
and then nemo's dad ... he swims out to the ocean , and they bump into ... ... three ferocious sharks .
he scares away the sharks by blowing 'em up !
golly , that's amazing .
and then dives thousands of feet ... ... straight down into the dark .
it's wicked dark down there .
you can't see a thing .
how's it going , bob?
and the only thing they can see down there ... ... is the light from this big , horrible creature ... with razor sharp teeth .
nice parry , old man .
and then he has to blast his way ...
so , these two little fish have been ... searching the ocean for days on the east australian current .
which means that he may be on his way here right now .
that should put him in sydney harbor ... ... in a matter of days .
i mean , it sounds like ... this guy is gonna stop at nothing ... ... till he finds his son .
i sure hope he makes it .
that's one dedicated father , if you ask me .
mine !

i was so ready to get out ... so ready to taste that ocean ...

nothing should be worth that .
i'm sorry i couldn't get you back to your father , kid .

oh , nigel !
you just missed an extraction .
has he loosened the periodontal ligament yet?
what am i talking about?
where's nemo?
i've got to speak with him .
what is it?
your dad's been fighting the entire ocean ...
looking for you .
my father?
really?
he's traveled hundreds of miles , battling sharks and jellyfish ...
sharks?
that can't be him .
what was his name?
some sort of sport fish .
tuna?
trout?
marlin?
marlin !
the little clownfish from the reef .
it's my dad !
he took on a shark !
i heard he took on three .
three sharks?
that's 4, 800 teeth !
after you were taken by diver dan over there ... your dad followed the boat like a maniac .
really?
he's swimming , giving it all he's got ... and then three gigantic sharks capture him ... and he blows them up and dives thousands of feet ... and gets chased by a monster with huge teeth !
he ties this demon to a rock , and what's his reward?
he gets to battle an entire jellyfish forest !
now he's with a bunch of sea turtles on the e. a. c ... and the word is he's headed this way right now ... to sydney !
wow !
what a good daddy !
he was looking for you after all , sharkbait .
he's swimming to the filter !
sharkbait !

sharkbait , you're ... covered with germs !
aah !

this tank'll get plenty dirty in that time ... but we have to help it along any way we can .

good afternoon !
we'll have a great jump today !
ok , crank a hard cutback as you hit the wall .
there's a screaming bottom turn , so watch out !
remember ... rip it , roll it , and punch it !
he's trying to speak to me , i know it !
you're really cute , but i don't know what you're saying !
say the first thing again .
ok , jellyman !
go , go , go !
whoa !
wahoo !

it's me .
all righty , mr. smartypants .
and it's orange and small and white stripes ...
and it's orange and small and white stripes ...
me .
and the next one , just a guess , me .
that's just scary .
wait , wait , wait .
i have definitely seen this floating speck before .
that means we've passed it before ... and that means we're going in circles ... and that means we're not going straight !
hey , hey !
get to the surface .
we'll figure it out up there .
let's go !
hey !
relax .
what?
take a deep breath .
now , let's ask somebody for directions .
now , let's ask somebody for directions .
fine .
who do you want to ask , the speck?
there's nobody here !
there has to be someone .
it's the ocean , silly .
we're not the only two in here .
let's see .
ok , no one there .
nope .
nada .
there's somebody .
hey !
excuse ...
dory , dory , dory !
now it's my turn .
i'm thinking of something dark and mysterious .
it's a fish we don't know .
lf we ask it directions ... it could ingest us and spit out our bones !
what is it with men and asking for directions?
i don't want to play the gender card right now .
let's play the " let's not die " card .
you want to get out of here?
of course i do .
how are we gonna do that unless we give it a shot?
dory , you don't fully understand ...
come on .
trust me on this .
