rex .
um , i'd like to be on the show because ...
i wanna get famous .
the prize is still a million dollars?
the challenge .
for the experience , to learn about myself .
grow as a person and all that bullshit .
why should you pick me?
you should pick me cos ...
um ...
i'm a fucking people person .
um ...
why should you choose me?
i'm a team player .
what do i think about the rules?
nightly curfew?
if it's a house in the middle of nowhere , why the need to break the curfew?
stay indoors when we're sleeping and go out during the day .
it's not hard .
well , er , usually i don't like rules but , you know , these ones don't bother me .
i think i could stick to the rules for a million dollars , yeah .
hey , check it out .
i think we're being watched .
fantastic .
get up !
good morning .
this'll be of interest to some of you .
morning , matt .
you guys definitely waste food .
i miss fresh fruit .
are you gonna eat those?
go nuts .
you know what i miss?
the ocean .
i'm missing june my social worker .
june , if you're watching this , i miss you .
i miss shops .
when we get out , we'll look so yesterday .
next week , we'll have plenty of money for new stuff .
hear , hear .
what do you miss , emma?
intelligent conversation .
amen , sister .
i miss my grandpa .
oh , grandpa !
what?
i'm gonna take him on vacation when we get back .
and i've missed my friends .
although i'd like to think i've made some new ones .
ayy !
probably just a coyote .
yeah , it's always a damn coyote .
i hate this house .
fucking creepy ass house .
what is it?
you see anything?
no .
nothing , as usual .
you do think he's cute , right?
he's cute .
so?
so?
so i'd prefer my intimate moments to be intimate moments .
it's not a porn site .
you could always do it under the covers or in the den .
the freezer !
i don't know , there's just ...
there's something .
he's just so intense all the time .
oh , yeah .
he's a guy , and it's been six months that he's been here , he's really fucking horny , he'd fuck a hole in the wall !
shh !
ok .
let's take a look .
it's definitely cold in the house .
nobody brought the flashlight , huh?
what do i do with the clicker thingy?
i'm fine .
you motherfuckers .
this is deliberate , they're putting the squeeze on us .
look at this .
everything has to have an angle with you .
maybe it just broke down .
so what do we do?
i don't know .
start a fire .
yeah , there's no dried firewood outside .
no , but there's plenty of dry shit in the attic .
we can chop some of that up .
go to work , boys .
oh , god !
smells like piss in here .
looks like mommy and daddy liked to keep the kiddies in the cupboard .
what parent would do that?
they must have been talking to my stepfather .
take cover !
i always wanted a talking one .
oh , emma .
yes , matt?
oh , emma .
matt?
emma .
matt .
emma .
emma !
emma !
oh , emma !
oh , matt !
oh , emma !
oh , matt !
matt , wait !
wait !
what?
what?
matt !
what?
that's my ass .
i know , emma .
i know .
grow up , rex .
don't give me that nice guy bullshit .
you don't wanna fuck?
oh , matt ...
matt ... you don't have a dick !
why don't you ...
you don't have a dick?
you wanna talk small dicks?
yeah .
charlie talked to emma .
take cover !
yeah .
what the fuck are you laughing at?
today's the first day of the rest of your life as a nonsmoker .
jesus , i have never heard so many fucking owls .
you think they have a tape out there?
so , i'm thinking , when we get back , are we gonna get mobbed or what?
have to go into hiding?
have a stalker?
hmm?
ooh , yeah .
you knowthe number one cause of most stalkings?
forgetfulness .
forgetfulness?
people forgetting to close their curtains .
their curtains?
i read about this one lady who used to walk around inside her house at night , buck naked , lights on , curtains wide open .
she was always forgetting to close them because her property overlooked woods .
no one out there , right?
only there was .
this stalker guy .
just watching those bright , welcoming windows every night .
he started to think she didn't shut them because she wanted him to see in , that she was inviting him into her life .
so he started this fantasy relationship with her , all built out of little things like , when she'd hang her laundry out that was like a love token , an offering .
so he'd steal her panties .
and getting more and more intimate , this love affair in his head .
finally , one night he breaks in .
only when he meets her , he meets a stranger .
an upset stranger freaking out , wanting him to get out .
he thinks she's just playing hard to get so he asserts himself .
rapes her .
strangles her to keep her from screaming .
thanks , matt .
yeah , thanks .
now i suddenly feel all on display .
how can you suddenly feel all on display?
it's like hello?
hello?
hello?
on the web is one thing , outside my window is another .
don't worry .
statistically , strangers rarely kill strangers .
you're much more likely to be killed by somebody you know .
a kid i was at school with killed his parents .
no shit !
what happened there?
he used a hammer .
he beat them to death .
jesus .
that's a little harsh .
who was he?
did you know him?
give it up , emma .
i can't really remember , i moved away before it happened .
what was his name?
fuck .
probably just the wind .
what is that?
matt .
matt .
aah !
oh , jesus !
i'm sorry .
danny , there's someone upstairs .
in the attic .
are you sure?
yeah .
all right .
let's go .
it's coming from up there .
jesus !
it's ok .
it's just scared .
crows can scent death , it's kind of a bad omen to have them flying around your house .
whoa .
oh .
i think it's hurt .
hold that .
there we go , i got him .
i got him .
it's got a broken wing .
oh !
it was the kindest thing to do .
i'll take it out at daybreak .
aaah !
oh , god , rex .
what the fuck are you guys doing up here?
i'm going to bed .
we had a visitor .
what?
yeah .
it must have thought it was trapped .
oh .
yeah , i can relate .
this fucking house .
'what would i do for a million bucks?
'i guess i'd do as little as i had to . '
would you drive to school naked?
'do i have to get out of the car? '
hey , guys package .
a package !
nice find , danny .
i found it by the pool .
come on , food , food , food , food !
cigarettes , cigarettes .
yes , yes , yes , yes !
bricks?
bricks?
and a letter .
this isn't funny .
we need supplies .
they're tightening the screws .
it's addressed to you .
i want a letter .
what is it , man?
danny?
hey .
so , the letter said that the funeral takes place in two days in florida .
florida?
yeah .
so obviously he wouldn't make it back for the curfew .
we can't stop him if he wants to go .
no .
we just have to persuade him that it's in his best interests to stay here .
his best interests?
we don't even know if this letter's real .
only a twisted mind would think of that .
yes , and they are twisted .
what , bricks instead of food?
you don't think this could be part of their game?
could you build a creepier house?
what if they're fucking with us?
think about it no heat , no food , nowthis .
danny's the weakest link , they wanna break us .
come on .
no , think about it .
really think about it .
we are this close to a million dollars , guys , we are this close .
they don't want to pay us , they don't want us to make it .
or maybe they're spicing it up for the viewers .
or maybe his grandfather is dead !
if his grandfather's dead , he's dead .
i'm sorry .
his grandfather practically raised him .
do you have no feelings at all?
cut the crap , i'm here for the money , ok?
so are you .
dress it up however you want exposure , slumming it , finding yourself i don't know .
the only person not here for the money is the one who needs it the most but , no , danny's here to make friends .
fine , let's be friends to the guy , let's give him some long term , practical help .
well , we can't hold a gun to his head .
no .
ok .
we'll tell him we'll have an alternative memorial service in the yard .
emma , tell him .
you tell him .
we all know he likes you best , just ask him nicely .
you would do it best .
maybe we should just let him go .
some things are more important than money .
yeah , what , like pussy?
hey , man , fuck you .
doesn't family mean anything to you?
you don't miss what you've never had , man .
take cover !
'let's go . '
look !
what?
what the hell ...?
jesus .
it must have been one of the guys fucking around .
no .
charlie , i think it's someone else .
who?
i think we're out of shot .
shoot .
you know i told you all about that kid at my school who killed his parents?
his name was john riley .
well , he wasn't just a kid at my school , he was a kid on my street .
we used to play together after school .
we had this one favourite game , scaredy cat , where we'd see who could spook each other the most .
and it started out , you know ,
like jumping out from behind trees shouting , " boo !
that kind of thing .
but then it got more serious .
john had a kitten , which he adored .
he'd sneak it into school in his knapsack .
one time ...
i swapped the kitten for a brick and i tossed the knapsack into the school pool .
he was so scared , he peed his pants .
right in front of everyone .
when i showed him the kitten was fine , he just gave me this look , this black look .
like , " never turn your back
because one day i'm going to get you back for this .
but he wouldn't surrender the game .
he just kept screaming ,
you sick bitch .
first the bricks in the package , now someone writes this .
it feels so personal .
i mean , why am i being singled out?
charlie ...
you don't think that ...
emma , i ...
i just think that we've been in this house way too fucking long .
like rex says , it's all a game .
i bet it's the company ...
but how would they know all that?
i don't know .
research , i guess .
let's just go back to bed , ok?
come on , it'll be ok .
come and keep me warm .
guys , a package .
better be food this time .
oh .
sweet .
champagne .
they do still love us .
five .
you motherfuckers .
one for each , i guess .
i know what this ...
you cocksuckers , i know what this means .
fuck you .
do your fucking research , cos him doing that to himself was the best thing that ever fucking happened to me .
what?
i say we put this out of harm's way .
come on .
let's go upstairs .
they think they can fuck with me now?
his dad , right?
you're here to check up on me .
it's not a front , matt , i just don't care .
i wish i did but i don't .
anyways , i brought my own coping mechanism .
sit down .
hand me that book .
you want to worry about somebody , worry about bundy .
i don't know whether to feel sorry for him or be afraid of him .
why did they pick you , matt?
what are the skeletons in your closet?
like i'm gonna spill it now?
give them some ammo to shoot me with?
that's good .
yeah , that's good .
but if there are any , they got 'em already .
question is , do you have any?
or are you just sliced white bread?
is someone out there?
emma?
you ok?
the security lights just popped and i would swear there's someone on the edge of the forest .
look , you're just freaked out .
charlie told us what happened last night .
emma , you can't think this has anything to do with ...
to do with what?
when you were a kid , you know?
yeah .
i guess that would be ridiculous .
i know .
yeah .
aaah !
emma !
what ...?
what's wrong?
what is that?
oh , my god .
oh , shit .
is that some kind of joke?
rex , did you put that in there?
fuck off , charlie .
just don't touch it !
put it down !
what the fuck?
i didn't put it there !
did you hear anybody?
there's people , like , walking round the house?
calm the fuck down , please .
for two seconds .
emma , there's nobody here .
guys , this is the company all over again .
they've raised the stakes but they're playing the same fucked up game , so calm down .
they're coming inside now?
game over .
i can't take this .
what are you doing?
what are you doing?
i'm gonna radio them .
they can pick me up .
no , no , no , no .
i mean , no .
listen .
wait , stay .
emma?
emma , emma .
look , it was me .
ok?
it was me .
i'm sorry .
it was a stupid joke .
i'm sorry .
i'm sorry .
wait .
what's your problem?
what's your problem?
you're always picking on people .
stop it !
stop it !
come on .
danny !
it's not worth it .
you ok?
i'm here for the money .
what's your excuse?
what , you've got no life of your own?
it's not real enough for you?
no family?
what is it?
i pity you .
you sad fuck .
rex .
i just wanted to say that , even for you , that was really fucked up .
why would you do that?
i didn't put it there , ok?
i didn't put it there , i just said i did so emma wouldn't leave .
i need that fucking prize money and i wasn't gonna let her leave .
oh , shit .
oh , god , don't do that .
i still think it's the company , all right?
it's the company .
but how would they get it in there?
they control all this shit , right?
it's part of their game .
they wanted to spice things up so this is what they do .
plus , i think ...
you know , maybe they're ... pissed off there hasn't been any action or whatever .
well , not recently .
anyways ...
you think they're punishing us?
yeah .
i don't know , maybe .
maybe we've been ... punishing ourselves , you know?
god , i wish i had a smoke .
charlie , wait .
charlie , charlie , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait .
ok .
you want a cigarette?
don't say i never did nothing for you .
one pack of cigarettes .
for you .
oh , my god .
what the fuck is this?
it's just some ...
you hoarding little bastard !
shut the fuck up .
oh , my god .
guys !
guys !
charlie , shut the fuck up .
fuck you , you little prick .
i'll spli ...
great .
why'd he take cigarettes?
he doesn't even smoke .
to fuck with me .
he's a snake .
he'd sell his own grandmother .
he says my grandpa's not dead .
that the letter's fake and it's all part of the game .
do you think it's true?
you got to give me some of that .
you are such a selfish bastard .
oh , fuck you .
fuck you , you are so fucking self righteous .
you're so fucking self important .
all this john riley bullshit , do you really think he gives a fuck about you now?
jesus , emma , you must really fucking rate yourself .
knock it off , rex .
go fuck yourself , matt , cos she's not going to .
you know , if i was a psycho killer ,
i wouldn't be hanging out there .
i'd have my sights set right on this house .
that's enough , rex .
don't kid yourself , she's not into you either .
asshole .
ahem !
hey , psycho !
oh , my god .
don't be a fucking prick , rex !
psycho killer , come on in !
rex .
it's nice in here !
we got food , we got liquor ,
we got women !
just stop .
one in particular you might be interested in .
come on in .
fuck , there is somebody out there .
shit .
the lights .
there is someone there .
aah !
shit .
he's heading this way .
it's cold out there , maybe he needs help .
would you recognise him?
we'll only open the door if you're 100 % certain it's not him .
is it john?
i don't know !
please open up the door .
no !
danny , no !
it's all right .
what's wrong with you?
hey !

i'm a gemini .

just the reaper .
i swear , a few more hours out there and i'd be as dead as ...
i'd be as dead as the battery on this gps .
let me see that .
it's a locator?
yeah .
so you know where we are?
yeah .
you guys don't?
no , we don't .
uh , i don't mean to be rude , obviously you're very concerned about security , but who the fuck are you guys?
you don't recognise us?
should i?
are you on the internet?
all the time , i'm a programmer .
and you don't know who we are?
i'm sorry .
i'm tired , am i missing a joke here?
we're part of an internet webcast .
like a human aquarium .
see , there's webcams all over the place , even in the bathroom .
they run 24/ 7 .
people subscribe to us .
what's the site?
we weren't told .
you weren't ...
you weren't told?
the company that set this up didn't start advertising till we got here .
well , they didn't do such a hot job because i never heard of you .
and i live online .
maybe you live in the wrong area .
well , it's the internet .
it's the worldwide web .
there's a lot of sites .
yeah .
so why would i watch you guys?
what's your hook?
she takes her clothes off .
shut up .
jerk .
i'm charlie .
i'm travis .
sorry my hands are cold .
you're sure you've never seen me before?
no .
i'd definitely remember .
uh , we're here .
thanks .
what's the scale of this map?
on this map , what's the scale?
1 : 50, 000 .
oh , fuck !
we're in the middle of nowhere .
yeah , pretty much .
what's the nearest town?
uh , wilmington is .
where's that?
that's ...
that's right over there .
so where'd you ski from?
from my truck .
so where's your truck?
where i left it , i guess .
does anybody wanna dance?
yeah .
yeah .
do you believe his story about skiing out here?
i don't know .
maybe i'm being paranoid but it seems too convenient .
you know , he didn't seem fazed at all by the cameras .
remember howfreaked out we were when we moved in?
were?
are you gonna pass that?
i only hope charlie knows what she's getting herself into .
emma , um , do you want ... do you want to dance?
no , danny .
thank you .
i'm gonna go to bed .
emma .
rex , do you want to dance?
asshole .

say hi to the wife for me .
god , isn't charlie great?
he thinks we're morons .
we know who you're working for , and i want you to tell the company that we're gonna get that million dollars .
you so need to get laid .
come in , big boy .
big boy " has left the building .
sugar?
take cover !
danny .
i'm gonna say something to you , and i want you to listen very carefully .
i am sorry about all that's happened to you , but it's no excuse .
there's no excuse for you taking my things .
i can't be friends with someone who does that .
i didn't take anything .
danny ,
i found these in your room , ok?
i didn't take them .
danny !
look , we're not here much longer , ok?
so why don't we just try to be civil , polite and honest with each other , ok?
matt !
guys , get in here !
delivery?
'time out . '
i found it by the snare .
it's travis's backpack .
was it a grizzly?
oh , my god !
no , there are no animal tracks , no footprints either .
we have to radio for help .
for who?
for travis?
it's not real , it's part of the game .
relax .
i don't know .
you don't know what?
there's blood , he could be hurt .
he's not .
looks real to me .
he's not .
if he was , where's the body?
they want us to call for help , guys .
that's what they want .
if we do , you think some cop is gonna care about our curfew when he sees my rap sheet?
all you can think about is the curfew .
if we call the cops , we lose .
that's what they want .
that's what they want !
oh , christ !
fine .
fine , you know what?
if you're that worried , talk to them .
they can get help , right?
yeah , somebody ...
guys !
you've seen what's happened here .
you know where we are .
send help .
oh , yeah .
and travis , if that is your real name , go fuck yourself .
you're not gonna scare me out of my money .
ok , buddy?
don't give them the pleasure , guys .
they've laughed enough at our expense as it is , especially at you , charlie .
what?
especially at you .
fuck you !
you knowthat whole thing was a setup , right?
that's why he picked the easy target .
you noticed he wasn't too afraid of the cameras , right?
travis , travis , travis .
where are you now , you son of a bitch?
emma .
danny .
i didn't take your clothes .
it was them .
they're messing with us .
it's just part of a game .
danny , please , don't ...
look , i made this for you .
take it .
danny , i can't take that .
i made it for you .
ok .
charlie .
from danny .
oh , i get it .
it's your pussy .
hi , emma's pussy .
scratch and sniff .

he spent hours down there , bashing away with his little thingy .

emma's creepy pussy .
it's horrible .
guys !
danny .
matt .
matt , don't .
don't .
don't !
he's dead .
he's dead .
emma .
oh , my god .
i can't look .
i'm fine .
it's ok .
i'll get it .
it's ok .
it's not ok .
it's not ok !
it's so not ok .
what are we gonna do?
we wait for the helicopter .
game's over , right?
can't go on now .
what about ...?
it's not our responsibility .
it's their fucking game .
we've played everything fair up till here , guys .
this is not our fault .
we've done nothing wrong here .
we can't .
we can't leave him there .
you're not supposed to move him .
i saw it on tv .
we can't move him .
we should cover him .
we should cover him .
or we could take him outside .
outside?
yeah , well , you want ...
where else?
ok .
you guys take him outside , and we're gonna try the radio .
please .
that's good .
hello , can anybody hear me?
please , somebody's dead .
please help .
please , we need help .
nobody's there .
i just fucking can't believe that he ...
this isn't what we signed up for .
no , it's not .
what kind of a sick fuck would subscribe to this?
hold on a minute .
hold on a fucking minute .
ok .
sorry the way things have turned out for us .
it's ok .
come here .
emma , i ...
guys !
guys !
you've got to fucking see this .
where's charlie?
charlie !
ever wonder howthe company plans on paying us?
or howthey pay for the house , the food and the helicopter?
advertising .
subscriptions .
you don't get one without the other .
if nobody subscribes , the revenues dry up .
and i've been thinking , this guy travis , he was a fucking programmer , a web head .
he should spend his entire life on the internet , so how had he never seen a single ad?
there's tons of shit on the internet .
right .
that's why i went on the internet .
how?
the satellite uplink still works .
where did you learn that?
computer club .
i've been looking for our site .
i have put our names through every single fucking search engine i can think of and i have got nothing , guys .
and i mean nothing at all .
not even an advertisement .
nothing , not a single fucking ad .
it's a big place .
yeah .
but why are they making it so difficult to find the site?
if they want people to go to it , why are they making it so tough?
well , i did find it .
it was hard as hell , but i found it .
but it's fucked .
it doesn't have a name , it's a beta site .
i tripped over it , i was tipped off on a hacker newsgroup .
what's a beta site?
a beta site is a ...
like a password name , like a mess of letters and numbers instead of a real name .
it's fucked .
take a look .
this is our site?
i don't know .
i'm trying to subscribe , i've been using travis's credit card .
this has a limit of $50, 000 .
how do you know?
you learn a lot at computer club .
you can buy a house with that .
but it doesn't get you to the keyhole on this .
i don't get it .
i don't get it either .
i don't get it either !
this place doesn't fucking advertise .
it doesn't even have a real address , so all i can come up with is that it doesn't want to attract attention .
but why?
and the security ... the security is fucking insane .
i threw every hacker file i have at this , we're talking serious back door fuckers , and i still can't bypass the encryption .
so what's your point?
my point , guys ... simply put , is why the fuck would people pay so much money to watch us?
i wanna know , is this thing legit?
is it fucking legit?
is it legal?
like a porn site?
yeah , but except for her escapades it's hardly porn .
so , what is it then?
what?
am i the only person thinking this here?
is it only clear to me?
nobody's ever heard of a snuff movie before?

what are you looking for , rex?
i saw it in here somewhere .
what?
come on , you son of a bitch .

we can set this off .
