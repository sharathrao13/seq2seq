you don't have to .
i did them in case ...
you did them 'cause mum told you to .
yes , i did .
but it's your party .
it's mum's party .
no , it's your birthday .
it's your party and if you ...
if you don't feel like inviting anyone , then ...
but i will .
it's not odd when you're new somewhere
that it's difficult finding friends in the beginning .
in the beginning?
dad , we've been here for two years .
no .
we moved here in june , that's one and a half .
i will give them out !
but you don't have to .

i just don't want to go to christian's party .
it's mild weather .
i want to go to a rave .
to a rave? !
or we could mug a pensioner .
you're a twisted sicko !
you're so boring !
we could go to agnes 'party .

agnes , aren't you having a party?
ignore it .
i hate her .
everything's so boring .
just ignore it .
i hate my life !
agnes .
i'm going to stop breathing .
hey , agnes , we'll come to the party !
what're you doing in my room?
checking for my ice skates .
why'd they be here?
jessica?
fetch my skirt , i can't wear these
oh , god .
i don't know how to have it .
i'm so beautiful !
my stomach ...
i'm going to be miss sweden .
you're too small .
why?
how old do you have to be?
you're too small , you're too short .
i'll do it anyway .
shit .
where's my skirt?
what skirt?
my skirt , didn't you bring my skirt?
elin , are you completely ...
are you thinking of going out like that?
no , i was just going to use the mirror and ...
good god ...
that's the way it is .
we can't go out 'cause i wasn't wearing any pants?
you're still too immature to understand you can't go around like that?
imagine if it'd been someone else?
yes , imagine .
i'd be embarrassed myself .
get a mirror so we don't go out there .
we had a lovely mirror , but someone broke it .
you're nagging ...
mum , it was just the lift .
she wasn't going to go out .
let this be a lesson .
it doesn't hurt being at home .
i don't like you going out to raves ...
mum , it isn't a rave , it's just a normal party .
it's elin who goes on about raves .
it's decided .
but , we've never even been to a rave .
you know that raves are out?
i read it in a magazine .
they were in an " out " list .
where does it say they're out?
here , somewhere .
why must we live in fucking shit and piss ml? !
when something's in it takes so long to get here
it's out already because we're so fucking behind !
we can't stay here , we have to move !
i'm working tonight .
you can stay here together and have fun .
i bought crips and soft drinks .
well done , elin .
great to be home .
goodbye .
we'll leave later , she can't check .
how many did you invite?
a few .
but i'm not sure they'll ...
i'll put everything out .
then they can sit where they like .
what's that smell?
it's roast beef in the oven .
great !
how appropriate !
i thought ...
your daughter's vegetarian and you're serving meat .
fantastic !
but , sweetheart ...
i thought we could take a few of these .
look .
can't we take some of these?
novalukol .
novalukol novum .
you can't swallow them .
" 30 lozenges for cases of heartburn " .
but if you take a lot ...?
no , it won't work .
there's nothing to drink .
what about this?
longovital .
herb and vitamin tablets " .
drop it , elin ...
what about alvidon?
come on !
nothing'll happen .
yes ...
but i want to take some drugs !
but nothing'll happen .
yes it will .
no , no it won't .
yeah .
i'll do something else .
fall in love .
i thought you were .
with who?
the italian?
he wasn't italian .
he said he was .
i always wanted an italian .
where'd he come from?
bosnia?
something like that .
he wasn't italian , anyway .
aren't you in love with him anymore?
no , that was yesterday .
you should think of your reputation .
stop complaining .
you're just the same .
you've had as many as me .
no i haven't .
have .
haven't .
no?
but you sleep with them .
i don't .
only one .
no one's putting anything in me .
fingers maybe ...
and that's markus .
ah , markus ...
i only sleep with one ...
i haven't slept with anyone , anyway .
no , but you've necked about 70, 000 .
so what?
you know people are talking?
really?
you know what zero times zero is?
that's how much i care .
they won't do it when i'm a film star .
they'll just proudly say they knew me
went to the same school .
there's their house " and stuff ...
johan , you owe me 100 crowns .
where's your wallet?
you'll get it .
give it here .
i see ...
must have been my brother .
sure .
johan ...
elin?
i just think she's nice .
'course she's nice , but ...
know how many she's been with?
no .
everyone's been with her .
not me .
she's not worth having .
i think she's worth having .
jesus , you're 17 and she's 14 .
that's three years .
jessica is 16 .
there's one year between us .
three between you .
makes no odds if you like each other .
shall i talk to her?
i can call and fix it .
see if she's going to the party .
listen , johan wants to know something about elin .
is elin going to the party?
johan hult?
he wants to know if you're going to christian's .
he's in love with you .
what she say?
that elin's coming .
anything else?
like ... like she was interested .
she thinks you're good looking .
jessica said that?
that elin thinks so?
you sure? yeah .
did jessica say that elin thinks i'm good looking?
what'd you say?
i said you thought nothing of him .
not as far as i know , anyway .
god this sucks !
want a ride? " he'll be after me all night .
i'm not going .
you wanted to fall in love .
not johan hult !
i think johan is sweet .
he's at high school and has a moped !
yes , but maybe he'd be good for you .
hardly .
can't we go somewhere else?
where?
i don't know .
i'd even rather go to agnes .
agnes? !
yeah , from 9a .
she's having a party .
are you braindead , or what?
what if a great guy is there?
at agnes '?
yes , maybe she knows someone really nice .
sure .
people from somewhere else .
from where?
don't be so negative !
sffle , bengtsfors , mellerud ...
please ...
okay , okay ...
thanks !
i'm hungry .
we'll wait a little while .
i've waited .
when are they coming?
have a little patience .
mum , no one's coming .
here they are .
hi .
welcome .
thanks .
i'll fetch olof to help you up .
can we have food now?
just wait a while .
perhaps robyn's silly , but i think it smells really good .
let me see .
wow ...
she has her own perfume .
have you seen it , oskar?
can we have food now?
maybe that's a good idea .
what do you say , dear?
i can't accept this .
sorry , but i can't accept this .
what can't you accept?
if this is the best you can do , don't bother .
agnes .
go home and take your perfume .
we're just pretend friends because there's no one else to be with .
not so?
you know the most boring thing i've done?
going to wheelchair basketball in karlstad with you .
i don't want to be friends with a palsied cripple
who listens to backstreet boys , arvingarna , or whatever shit you listen to .
blame yourself !
i didn't want a party , it was your idea .
cut it out .
i don't want to hear one more word .
you can stay here and enjoy the wonderful roast beef !
have fun !
i'd like to go home .
no one will ever like me !
why should i live?
i don't want to live , i want to die !
no , i want to die !
i'm sorry ...
this whole party business ...
what were you thinking?
that all my friends would come?
i have no friends , haven't you understood , not one !
mum hasn't understood anything , anyway .
hey , there there ...
'cause she can't understand these things ...
she's always been so perfect , always had everything ...
sweetheart .
i know exactly how she was .
she was ... she was like one of those ...
now she thinks it awful her daughter's become so strange
and ugly , a failure , repulsive !
but darling .
you're not a failure , repulsive or strange at all ...
you're wonderful .
no , i'm not .
agnes , you're a wonderful person .
no , i'm not .
yes , you're wonderful ...
wonderful , agnes .
do you hear me?
i can't see why i agreed .
don't be so negative .
it might be fun .
sure .
watch out !
what are you doing?
a drain .
shit !
thanks .
let's have some fun .
don't you like it?
yes , it's good , i'm just not hungry .
but you like it?
shall we rent a video?
or is it too late?
it seems totally dead .
shall we just forget it?
i don't want to .
you can't just sit here .
they can go .
the party's cancelled .
wait ...
go and tidy up and i'll tell them ... .. to come in and wait here .
what's all this?
here , have some .
what party is this?
are we the only ones?
why complain?
we got wine and everything .
yes , but like ...
okay , we'll drink the wine and go .
okay .
cheers .
cheers .
wasn't anyone there?
yes , but they weren't hungry .
so they went up to your room .
my room?
i have them a little wine .
who was it?
jessica and elin .
no one i know .
jessica and elin?
did you lock it?
hello !
i'm just ...
why'd you lock it?
i'm avoiding her .
we'll just drink up and leave .
i'm just ...

i just want to get drunk !
they're changing .
you can go to the lounge .

i'll give you 20 .
okay .
but you won't dare .
you'll have to leave .
hi .

there's something i want to tell you .
can't you just say it?
but ...
i don't want jessica to hear .
but ... why?

i really don't want her to hear .
it's just that ...
you're so pretty .
jesus , elin , you're insane !
that's disgusting !
here's 20 .

have they already left?
no , but we were going to a party and i didn't want to go .
i don't want to , i'm tired .
i don't feel like it .
fucking hell !
why'd i do that?
it was just a joke .
no , i'm going back .
i must say sorry .
fuck that !
we're going to have fun , i'm drunk .
then they kissed each other .
no !
is it true?
you kissed her for 20 crowns?
was it worth it?
hi babe .
how are you?
good .
how was it?
wicked !
you kidding !
was it nice?
it was horrible , what do you think?
everyone knows you're not like that , anyway .
what if her dad answers and comes to the school?
he could ...
or her mother .
ahlberg .
hi , is that agnes?
i want you to know you make me so hot .
can't i come round so we can lick each other or something?
she's checking you out .
no .
are you an arsehole , or what?
are you in love with her?
no !
or , yeah ...
are you braindead?
you're in love with her .
come on !
i'm sorry .
i didn't mean to .
don't you feel well?
leave !
wait , i'll give you something to drink .
here .
thanks .
jesus , you're beautiful .
you're the most beautiful of all .
you're drunk .
it's true .
you're drunk .
it's true .
i like you .
get ... out the way !
out the way !
take it easy !
out the way !
hey , i didn't mean to .
hey ... please .
don't go .
look , mine's much smaller .
markus ...
smaller maybe , but mine's thinner .
it's smaller and thinner .
markus , can't we go?
agnes .
come in .
hi ...
i've made some tea .
how are you?
i'm reading .
you're not upset?
no .
what are you reading?
ah , edith sdergran ...
the day sighs into the night
how does it go?
take my hand
take my arm take my th ... " " thin shoulder's longing " dad ...
'night .
agnes !
agnes .
hi .
i didn't mean to do that .
it was really silly .
had you gone to bed?
could i use your toilet?
i'm gonna pee myself .
alright .
thanks .
no , don't turn it off .
it was really nice .
i'm so tired of it .
can't you put on something else?
wow , this is really good .
can i use some?
sure .
what do you want to hear?
i don't know ...
is it true you're a lesbian?
if you are ,
i understand , 'cause guys are gross .
i'm also going to be one , i think .
but ...
maybe i should go home .
shit , let's go to the party .
i have to anyway 'cause my jacket's there .
we'll go and hit someone .
no , i'm not invited .
so?
we'll burn the house down .
come on .
please ...
you want to?
yeah .
what you gonna be when you grow up?
i don't know .
i'm going to be a model .
or i'm gonna be a psychologist .
i've also thought of that .
really?
you're also gonna be that?
dunno , it seems exciting digging in peoples minds and ...
but really , you'll probably find it silly , i'd most like to be a writer .
you can be that too .
you could books about those ... .. those , like , all that psychic stuff and mass murderers .
but i'd rather be a model .
you think i can be?
yes .
but i think it's more fun being a psychologist .
am i pretty enough?
yes , you are .
i don't think i want to go to that party .
why are you so weird?
i don't mean anything but ...
you are weird .
you're also weird .
am i?
yes .
i want to be weird .
well , not weird but ...
i don't want to be like everyone else .
though , sometimes i'm just the same ,
but you're not .
you know what my nightmare is?
that i'll stay in ml .
that i'll never move from here .
i'll get kids , a car , a house ...
all of that .
then my husband leaves with someone younger
and i'm stuck with kids that just scream and nag .
it's so fucking meaningless .
where're you from?
i mean , where'd you live before here?
mariefred .
was it fun there?
okay ...
more fun than ml , anyway?
maybe .
can i ask you something?
what?
have you been with lots of girls?
why're you asking that?
i was just wondering .
no , i haven't been with lots of girls if you must know .
when you kissed me ...
i could die , sorry !
it was the first time .
was it?
first and last time .
but that's completely wrong !
it's just 'cause you live in fucking ml .
it's so unfair .
if you lived in stockholm , for example , then ...
then you'd have loads of girls .
you think so?
yes ...
where're you going?
come .
we're going to stockholm .
you're not sane !
'course i am , 'course i'm sane .
okay , but you're on the wrong side .
what?
stockholm's that way .
i see ...
come on !
are you serious?
we say 10 cars from now .
if any stop , we're going to stockholm .
otherwise , forget it .
five .
10 .
five .
okay , five .
if any of them stop , it's like god's telling us .
idiot !
watch out !
when i get a car , i'll always stop for hitchhikers .
shit !
we'll do it .
let's do it !
should we?
come on !
hi .
we're going to stockholm .
we live there .
we've been visiting our aunt and got money for the train
and bought records with the money and can't get home .
you can come with me to karlstad .
thanks very much !
no !
it does this sometimes .
i'll just ...
what the hell are we doing?
we're fucking crazy !
i know .
but we're so fucking cool .
what on earth are you up to?
is this " candid camera "?
out of the car !
it's freezing .
i should go home .
mum's coming home soon and ...
but i can call you tomorrow .
do you want to?
you sure?
yeah ...
oops , i thought it was mum .
what're you doing?
have to eat the crips or she'll know we've been out .
can't we not have eaten them?
that would seem odd , she'll wonder .
elin ...
where've you been?
nowhere special .
some guy?
no ... yeah .
who?
no one .
tell me !
stop it .
but , tell me !
leonardo dicaprio is skinny .
no ...
he's got arms like this !
what about your mascara?
what do you mean " maskara "?
it's how i do my make up .
stop being nasty .
god , you're silly !
elin .
elin .
elin .
what were you dreaming about?
a nightmare .
didn't exactly sound like a nightmare .
did i say anything?
did i say anything?
nah .
you said ...
you were moaning and going on .
didn't sound like a nightmare .
but it was .
someone was going to kill me .
didn't sound like that .
but they were .
i was dreaming , wasn't i?
so i should know .
i know you're not a victim of palsy .
i don't know why i said that .
and that perfume actually smells really good .
and the wheelchair match .
basketball .
isn't the most boring i've done .
why'd you say it then?
i don't know .
you don't know?
you know what?
it doesn't make any difference anymore .
'cause i've never liked you .
and i never will , either .
it'll be so nice to be rid of you .
i won't need to worry you'll paw someone and be nauseating .
the whole school will found out what you are .
and hey ...
good luck with elin .
ahlberg .
am i disturbing you?
no .
were you calling him?
who?
him from yesterday you won't say .
no .
there was no one at home .
come out for a smoke .
hello?
tell me .
i can't , it's impossible .
but , do i know him?
if i told you you'd be totally ...
are you going to meet again?
no .
i said i'd call , but i won't .
of course you will .
you're in love .
i can see it .
i'm not at all !
why can't you just tell me who it is?
you don't understand .
you'd hate me , you'd never speak to me again .
you fucking cunt !
what the hell are you doing !
i knew you were after markus !
it's not him !
who is it , then? !
no one !
tell me !
tell me !
tell me who it is !
take it easy !
take it easy .
it's johan .
johan hult?
yes .
are you in love with johan hult?
hysterical !
you said he was ...
can't you change your mind?
sorry ...
i really thought it was markus !
go to hell !
be a fucking cunt yourself !
sorry !
we'll have number one up here .
here we go !
sweets !
mum ...
i'm a lesbian .
what?
homosexual .
i'm just kidding .
we have 1, 000 crowns on the line .
look at the first page .
aren't you going out?
no .
are you fighting again?
why do you always fight?
'cause we don't like each other .
'cause we're different .
she's the biggest drip and i'm the coolest in the world .
you sure we have the same dad?
of course you have !
let's not talk about him .
haven't you got a lottery ticket?
what?
no ...
why are we watching it then?
i thought we'd win a car .
why are we looking at it?
well , it's ...
lot's of reasons .
the music and ... other things too .
it's fun to watch when someone wins .
see how much they win .
totally meaningless ...
hello .
hi .
what are you doing?
can't you come here?
i don't know .
sorry i said what i did .
sorry i called you that and stuff .
i didn't mean to .
i really thought it was markus .
can't you come here?
i don't know .
please ...
yeah ...
johan's here .
please ...
okay , i'll come .
good .
see you later .
shall i talk to johan?
no !
don't be shy now .
yeah , i pump iron every day .
how much?
98 kg .
can i talk to you?
elin's sitting over there ...
i think she wants to talk to you .
with me?
yes .
just stroll over and talk to her .
should i talk to her?
yes , talk to her .
hi .
hi .
jessica said you wanted to talk to me .
have you got anything to drink?
yes .
have you?
here .
markus ... no ...
markus , control yourself ...
markus , we were just talking .
oh , yeah?
stop it ...
markus ...
elin .
it's agnes ...
hi .
hi .
hi .
hello .
sweetheart , how are you?
has something in particular happened?
shall we talk about it?
i recognize so much of myself in you .
when i was at your age ... .. i had no friends , no girls were interested in me .
but then ... then all of that changes .
and it becomes the other way around .
like when i was at the 25 year class reunion last spring .
i noticed that it was me ...
well , things had gone quite well for me .
i'd done quite well .
but that guy bengt
who was the king of the class then , he'd became nothing .
and those girls who were regarded as the prettiest in the class ... .. they weren't noteworthy at all anymore .
you should be glad you're not someone who has it easy
who has no problems , because those people are often uninteresting .
but dad you're talking , like , in 25 years .
sorry , but i'd rather be happy now than in 25 years .
sure , you're right .
perhaps it's not much of a comfort at the moment .
but , anyway ...
'cause in 25 years ...
that's , like , 25 years ... it doesn't exist .
are you two in the same programme?
i'm in electrics and he's in vehicles .
did you have to do that?
he was groping you .
he was doing nothing like that .
he wasn't doing that?
what programme are you going to do?
i haven't decided .
what's jessica going to do?
child and leisure .
she's also applied for hairdressing , but i don't think she'll get in .
don't be where i am then !
can't you see it's embarrassing?
you're a mental case .
thanks , maybe i am .
i'm with you .
you become what you're with .
i'm going to be a psychologist ...
i think so , anyway .
psychologist?
but which programme do i follow? .
are you going to be a psychologist?
yes .
you never said so .

i use two grams of milk and 5, 000 kg of chocolate .
