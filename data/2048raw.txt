thomas will take that for you .

oh , good afternoon , mrs tarbell .
is that jenny harrington's child?
yes , it is .
doesn't look a thing like any of the harringtons .
what's your name , girl?
speak up .
pollyanna whittier , ma'am .
well , you're a very fortunate little girl .
most children who have lost their parents would end up in an orphanage .
you know that , don't you?
yes , ma'am .
well , thank your lucky stars for such a good woman as your aunt taking you in .
yes , ma'am .
yes .
well , see that you're properly appreciative and don't cause any trouble .
children really never realize  ed?
uncle karl !
much too long .
it's good to see you .
oh , same here .
how's everything at the house?
wait till polly harrington hears about this !
right up here in the back seat , honey .
there you are .
nancy , what are you staring at?
oh , nothing !
nothing at all , sir .
think she'll want the car?
i don't know if she wants the car or not .
you'll have to ask her yourself .
your aunt's waiting for you , miss .
hurry up .
i haven't got all day !
oh , mr thomas .
please put that here .
all right , nancy .
all right .
you wait here , miss , and don't touch anything .
do you understand?
yes , ma'am .
well , we had , uh , matthew .
mark last week .
isaiah has some very good passages .
isaiah?
yes , that's more what i had in mind .
yes , isaiah has some very good passages .
what is it , nancy?
oh , excuse me , ma'am .
the little girl is here .
all right , show her in .
what you've been waiting for .
about the sermon , reverend .
yes .
now , the transiency of life ... that that fleeting , ephemeral vapour ... it appeareth and it vanisheth james , the new testament .
the perishability of our mortal bodies .
you want me to to weave a theme of this into my sermon?
well , let me tell you what my father said to reverend moffet .
yes .
what did he say?
he said that you only have the congregation for one short hour a week .
and there are six long days of mischief for them before you get them again .
aha !
i see your point .
strike hard on sunday the excessiveness of god's wrath and hope they carry it with them a few days into the week .
exactly what i mean .
oh , yes , yes .
well , come in , young lady .
let's meet each other properly .
i'm your aunt polly .
how do you do?
this is the pastor of our church , reverend ford .
how do you do?
well , there's a family resemblance .
she looks very much like her mother .
mother always used to say i look like you !
would you be good enough to stand erect and in a proper manner , please?
and where in the world did you get that dress?
it came in the missionary barrels .
missionary barrels?
yes .
her father was a minister .
as a matter of fact , he was a missionary in the british west indies .
pollyanna , this is going to be your new home ... and i hope you'll be very happy with me .
i'm very sorry about the dress , aunt polly .
my father said it was a size too big ... but that i should be glad it wasn't a pair of boys 'trousers .
well , that's hardly anything to be glad about .
well , my father always used to say that people
yes , well , never mind what your father used to say .
supper is at 6 : 00 sharp , and no one is ever late for meals at this house .
yes , ma'am .
nancy will show you your room .
i'm very glad you sent for me , aunt polly .
your home is very lovely .
well , thank you .
it must make you awfully glad .
glad?
that you're so very rich !
honestly !
did i say something wrong?
well , let's just say ... there are about sixty eleven things you could have said besides that .
i run a clean kitchen .
no shenanigans in here .
and you clean up after yourself , you hear me?
yes , ma'am .
you sure it was doc chilton?
mrs tarbell saw him first !
coming back after all these years !
d does she know yet?
old blabbermouth tarbell will see to that .
yeah .
now , mind what you're doing and don't spill your milk .
now , come along .
you hurry up and change your clothes and get back here .
i need your help .
all right , all right .
and if you see angelica , tell her to come down here too .
okay .
leaving me all alone here .
i'm very pleased to have met you , mrs lagerlof .
mmm .
now come along .
hello .
what's his name , please?
his name happens to be elizabeth .
oh !
you're a girl !
you're lovely .
now , leave her alone and come along .
how how do i address you , please?
well , just call me nancy , same as everybody else .
oh .
and this is angelica .
she's the upstairs maid .
how do you do?
psst !
psst !
at the back porch .
you know who .
now?
oh , for heaven's sake .
oh , angie , would you show her to her room , please?
well , i still have two rooms left to do .
i'll help you with the bedrooms in the morning .
all right , just this once .
come on .
come on .
will you get out of here?
come on .
hurry up .
i've got work to do .
now , come on and get up here .
i turn my back for one moment , and what do you do?
you disappear .
and don't spill that milk .
yes , ma'am .
i just got through cleaning up this hall .
yes , ma'am .
what are you doing now?
who lives in all these?
there's no one lives in them .
they're just there .
what for?
that's what being wealthy is .
you sure are a question asker , aren't you?
now , hurry up .
come on , come on .
don't dawdle .
well , what's the matter?
nothing .
oh !
stuffy !
not much of a room , is it?
but it's my own anyway .
i'm glad of that .
ooh , and the bed's soft .
and it's got a lovely window .
who's that man down there with nancy?
none of your business .
just make sure you're dressed in time for dinner .
you'd think she'd do better than this for her own niece .
almighty god , we thank thee for thy bounty .
grant unto us the grace ever to live in dread of thee .
and bless this food unto our nourishment that it may strengthen us ... to do thy will in all things .
amen .
oh , i'm sorry .
nancy , would you bring another glass of milk , please?
yes , ma'am .
my my clumsy old hand .
well , now , there's no harm done .
did you find your room satisfactory?
oh , yes .
it's very nice .
thank you .
you hadn't mentioned it , so i just wondered .
i've never had a whole room to myself before .
i must be higher up in the house than anyone , aren't i?
well , i'm not used to children's noises around the house ... and that's the reason i chose that one .
oh , i'm i love it .
i really do .
really !
aunt polly?
do you ever have steak and ice cream?
are you complaining about the food?
oh , no !
it's delicious !
i just wondered .
i love steak .
father always used to say that if we ever had the money you have ... we'd have steak and ice cream three times every day !
pollyanna , i think we ought to get one thing straight right now .
i don't want you constantly quoting what your father used to say .
do you understand?
nancy , i thought i made myself clear about gentlemen callers .
ma'am?
now , don't pretend you don't understand me .
i saw you and george dodds out in the summer house .
george has been every inch a gentleman with me , and it's not  we won't discuss it .
if you want to remain on my staff , i don't want you to see him any more .
do you understand?
yes , ma'am .
this is no concern of yours .
you can finish your supper , pollyanna .
in the fall , i'll introduce you to mr bainbridge .
he's the principal of our school , and he'll decide what grade you're to be in .
pollyanna , i think we should talk about you and your position in this community .
do you know why it's called harrington town?
my mother said it was named after my grandfather .
that's right .
and everyone in this town looks to us to set a good example ... in the way we conduct ourselves , in our duties and manners ... in what we think and even what we say .
so we must be good examples for everyone in everything we do .
is that clear?
yes , aunt polly .
just remember our family position and conduct yourself properly and modestly .
oh .
you mean what i said before?
i understand that now .
i'll never say that again .
you understand what?
about the money .
i'm not supposed to be glad we're so very rich , huh?
well , uh , i think it's time for you to get ready for bed , young lady .
may i kiss you good night?
please?
what?
kiss you?
i love you , aunt polly .
uh , just a moment , please .
come back here .
turn around once .
that dress is disgraceful .
tomorrow we'll go into town and get you some decent clothes .
store bought?
but of course .
where else would we get them?
out of an actual store?
new clothes?
well , you're a harrington now , and i want you to look like one .
yoo hoo !
pollyanna?
walk up the stairs like a lady , please .
store bought clothes !
what do you think of that , elizabeth?
i wonder if she meant new petticoats too .
and new garters and stockings and underpants .
don't tell anyone ... but it's wonderful to be so rich , isn't it?
nancy , something's come up .
i'm going with mrs tarbell .
would you please take pollyanna home?
yes , madame .
oh , i'll take that box , pollyanna .
now , get into the car , miss .
oh , pollyanna .
will you please get into the car?
we've simply got to get home !
oh !
george , stop it !
oh , pollyanna , you don't know my cousin fred , do you?
your cousin fred?
this is pollyanna whittier .
miss harrington's niece .
the one who's come to live with her .
oh .
oh , that one .
hello , pollyanna .
how are you , honey?
fine , thank you .
good .
well , uh , how about this?
running into you after all these
what's it been , six years?
say , how's your ma and pa?
well , they're just fine .
you know , pollyanna , i don't take too much to relatives .
but this girl here , she was always just like a sister to me .
i tell ya , i love this cousin .
will you cut it out?
uh huh .
well , look , uh , what are you girls doin '?
how'd you like to go down the street and get a great big dish of ice cream?
huh?
oh !
oh , no , that's a rotten idea .
she probably hates ice cream , doesn't she?
oh , probably .
who , me?
oh , no .
i love it !
really?
you do?
well , now , isn't that astounding?
how'd you ever develop a taste for that awful stuff?
oh , no , really !
i really do love it .
i
well , i know a wonderful place .
come on , girls .
follow old cousin fred to the land of strawberry frappe .
unless you'd rather go down the street and have a beer .
you're funny .
hey , you two , get down off that truck right now .
how many times did i tell you to keep away from the fire engine?
hey , get on , there !
go on !
i'm not gonna tell you again .
now , get off that ladder .
you you see?
right up there under the eaves?
just beyond the window is where  how'd it happen?
oh , the pipes busted , mayor .
both them boilers went up at the same time .
and before we knew it , we was up to our necks in water .
mr geary !
uh , comin '.
excuse me .
well , the children are safe , thank goodness .
i warned you about this and told you we should do something .
now , perhaps , you'll listen .
i've asked everyone ... to meet at my house , and we'll discuss this calmly .
a fine orphanage this is !
water pipes busting all over the place .
oh , dr chilton?
doctor , could you have a look at mr geary's arm?
oh , just scalded it a bit .
of course .
is there a dispensary here?
yes , doctor .
this way .
i wonder what's going on .
listen , miss , before we go in ... it might be just as well not to mention ... about the ice cream to your aunt .
my father told me never to tell a lie .
pollyanna ...
i didn't mean to tell a lie .
but there's no reason to bring up the subject if it isn't mentioned .
i mean , about cousin fred and all .
i like your cousin fred very much .
oh , he's all right , i guess .
he's very handsome , and he has a nice smile .
but there's something sort of ...
i don't know , funny about him .
what do you mean , funny?
i know what it is .
it's his name .
he doesn't look at all like a fred .
what?
he looks more like a george to me .
pollyanna !
wait a minute .
pollyanna , i told you to come directly home .
yes , i know , but
and know that when i tell you to do something , you must do it .
there are rules nancy , where have you two been?
it's almost 1 : 00 .
well , uh , you see , ma'am
have you been carrying on with george dodds again?
oh , it was my fault , aunt polly .
what do you mean , your fault?
well , i i just dawdled so .
it was the excitement of the new dress , i suppose .
polly , before karl warren get's here , we must talk .
oh , i suppose you're right .
nancy?
nancy , get into your uniform and help with the luncheon .
yes , ma'am .
and this is no place for you , young lady .
we have lots to do , so run along .
yes , aunt polly .
i'm sorry to start your vacation off like this , ed , but this won't take long .
don't worry about me , uncle karl .
i'll just wait out here .
fine .
fine .
oh , frieda , bessie , they're waiting for you in the conservatory .
right in there , ladies .
why , edmond .
this is a surprise .
well , if it isn't young dr chilton .
mrs tarbell .
i'll see if everyone's ready for you , polly .
thank you .
it's nice to see you again .
are you just visiting?
well , i thought it was time for vacation , the first one in five years .
i'm just waiting here for karl .
i won't be in the way here , i hope .
no , no , of course not .
seems strange , being back here again like this .
polly , they're all ready for you .
i'll be right there .
why don't you come in and join us?
no , i'd rather not butt in .
i'll wait here .
well , they're waiting for me .
go ahead .
i'll be fine here .
hi , nancy !
hi .
you better get out of here .
oh , i'm all right .
it should be parliamentary procedure , same as it's always been .
well , for once , let's have facts .
we always observe regular procedure .
oh , bunkum !
we're here because of an emergency .
everybody will be talking at the same time .
exactly !
hello .
hello .
is this the town meeting?
oh , no .
it's in there .
in the conservatory , for heaven's sake .
oh .
are you a member of the ladies aid group?
oh , no .
i'm just a child .
i'm not even supposed to be here .
what's your name?
pollyanna whittier .
that's my aunt over there , the pretty one .
this is her house , and i live with her .
wait just a moment , everybody .
we'll compromise .
we'll go to the immediate problems first .
good .
amelia , wouldn't you like to hear what karl has to say?
all i'm saying is that it's time we took some pride in that orphanage ... and put up a decent , presentable building that we could all be proud of .
that's all i'm saying , and i've been saying it ... for three and a half long years !
polly , he is completely out of line on the whole thing .
if we'd all be a little more quiet , cooperative , orderly .
if we'd all stop shouting and cooperate
there is nothing wrong with that building !
all it needs is new plumbing .
today the plumbing , tomorrow the roof and the lord knows what
excuse me , reverend .
who knows what's gonna happen next?
you were very happy when my father donated the building for the town .
oh , for pete's sake , polly harrington , listen to reason .
it's a dilapidated old relic !
the dining hall , the dispensary .
even my nephew , dr chilton there , he noticed that .
ed , tell them what you said .
well , i don't think i should say anything .
no , no .
now , come on .
tell them what you said .
i want them to hear it .
well , i got a look at the dispensary when i fixed mr geary's arm .
and i mentioned it seemed a little inadequate for 32 children there .
there you are .
now you've heard it .
we all thank you for your interest , edmond , but it's an equipment problem .
we're talking about harrington house , which is a landmark in this town ... and i intend to see that it stays that way .
we'll spend more trying to repair that old building ...
than it would cost to put up a new one .
it won't cost this town one cent !
my father donated the building to the town ... and i will stand the cost of the pipes or the plumbing ... or whatever it is that's necessary .
it's my duty , and i will not shirk it .
and i suppose there's not one of you out there that has the gumption ... to stand up and say what you think , is there?
what about you , reverend?
you're a man of influence in this community .
what do you think?
no !
no , no , i i , uh
i i never take sides in these matters .
that's comfortable .
ben?
speak up .
come on .
oh , karl !
charlie , what do you say?
well , say something !
anybody !
we do have other business to discuss .
that is , if you've finished , karl .
oh , yes , i've finished !
there's your whole town council and your whole civic conscience !
and you certainly don't need me as mayor around here as long as ... you've got polly harrington running everything .
karl never changes , does he?
uh , ladies and gentlemen , we're having a little light lunch .
suppose we stop for a while and have a bite .
if you ask me , reverend ford should have taken sides with mayor warren .
he had the chance , and what'd he do?
he says he never takes sides in these matters .
oh , stop stickin 'your nose into their business and get these sherbet glasses out there .
we're out of spoons .
well , wash some up .
don't stand there bellyaching to me about it .
you're in a fine mood , aren't you?
pollyanna , i thought you could use this for your room .
oh , thank you , nancy !
oh , it's gorgeous !
oh , well , thanks for not spilling the beans about you know who .
about cousin fred , you mean?
mm hmm .
isn't he handsome?
i knew it all the time !
you did?
how did you know?
well , sure , it was easy !
i saw you holding hands under the table .
if you ladies got nothing better to do ... than sit there gossipin 'and snickerin '
well , we're just talking , tilly .
well , talk on your own time .
this sherbet's turning to mush .
all right , all right .
nancy?
hmm?
you know that man?
what man?
the one at the train station .
the one that was just here .
well , what was he to aunt polly?
well , you might say they used to be friends sort of .
you think he's gonna marry aunt polly?
who's gonna marry her?
she means dr chilton .
huh !
fat chance !
who'd want to marry old pickle faced harrington?
nancy , are you and george gonna get married?
oh , we hope to someday .
oh , i am glad .
i think everyone should be married .
and maybe when you do marry george ...
aunt polly will see how happy you are and she'll be very glad to get married herself then .
glad this , glad that !
do you have to be glad about everything?
what's the matter with you anyway?
oh , lay off her , angie .
she's not hurting you .
oh , the way she goes on .
now , that's enough !
you heard what she said .
stop pickin 'on the girl .
now , take that sherbet out and serve it the way you should .
go on !
well , let's see what your aunt has on the menu for tomorrow .
roast chicken .
chicken every sunday .
your aunt has no imagination .
oh , i love roast chicken !
i'm glad tomorrow's sunday .
yeah .
wait till tomorrow .
you won't be so glad .
did you ever hear of sour stomach?
well , sundays around here ... give folks sour stomach for the whole rest of the week .
how come?
wait till tomorrow .
you'll find out soon enough .
praise him all creatures here below praise him above ye heavenly host praise father , son and holy ghost amen
death comes unexpectedly !
and the god, jehovah , will execute his vengeance on ye ... who despise his dying love and trample his benefits underfoot .
the unconverted soul , the foolish children of man ... do miserably delude themselves in the false confidence ... of their own strength and wisdom .
they trust to nothing but a shadow .
but bear testament .
death comes unexpectedly !
now , you say , " ah , no .
i i had not intended it to come now .
i had laid out matters otherwise .
i thought my scheme good .
i intended to take effectual care , but death came unexpectedly ...
like a thief , outwitting me , too quick for me .
oh , cursed foolishness , that i had flattered and pleased myself ... with vain dreams of repentance .
but sudden destruction caught me up .
and now he will deal with you .
now , the great king of heaven and earth ... will abolish and annihilate this pride !
will crush the hardened wretch of the polluted , infinite abomination ... and rain on him ... a deluge of fire and brimstone !
and where's their strength then?
where are the great leviathans who defy god then?
where's their courage , these these these these proud spirits?
yes ... death comes unexpectedly .
and the dread judge has the key of hell .
he shuts , and no man opens .
in hell ... you will be reserved in chains of darkness forever and ever .
this place of atonement , of damned souls and misery ... with nothing to relieve you , no comfort ... no water for your parched tongues ... no place to rest or take a breath ... but the everlasting , infinite convulsions of misery ... forever ... and ever and ever !
now , isaiah has warned us ... on the day of vengeance , the earth shall be laid to waste .
and the cormorant and the bittern shall possess the land .
the raven and screech owl shall dwell in it .
don't stare at the orphans , pollyanna .
and who is man ... to think he can withstand god's mighty wrath?
great mountains cannot stand before this wrath .
yea , he can lay the earth to pieces in one moment ... or shatter the whole universe with one stroke of his fiery sword .
how dreadful is the state of those who are in daily danger ... of this great wrath ... this abyss of death and despair .
yet , this is the dismal case ... of every soul in this congregation who has not been born again ... however moral or strict , sober and religious you may otherwise be .
there is no security for the wicked ... because there are no visible signs of death at hand !
unconverted men ... walk over the pit of hell on a rotten covering .
and there are innumerable places on this covering so weak ... they will not bear their weight .
and these places cannot be seen .
the arrows of death fly ... unseen as noonday .
god has many different unsearchable ways of taking the wicked from this world .
who here , in this congregation , listening to this discourse ... will soon be visited by this covenant of darkness?
there you are , sitting there ... calm in your knowledge of health , secure in your well being .
yet who could suffer the agonies of the damned of tomorrow?
yes , even today or maybe the next hour ... the next minute .
and if we were to know which of you it was ... what an awful sight it would be .
a soul doomed ... to the everlasting bottomless pit of a divine wrath !
yes ... death comes unexpectedly !
amen .
exactly !
i thought the reference to jeremiah at the finish was very effective .
didn't you , mrs ford?
yes .
i , uh , sometimes wonder whether it's necessary ... to talk so furiously at them though .
dear , isaiah , jeremiah and ezekiel ... were all recorded with flaming pens and fire .
i i can't deliver the message with syrup .
of course not .
your voice is god's instrument .
it should be used accordingly .
well , we try our best .
what'd i tell ya?
he sure sermonizes something fierce , doesn't he?
brimstone and damnation on top of ham and eggs !
the one day a week we have off .
i hate sundays .
ooh , i just hate them .
breakfast still a hot ball in our stomachs ... and him chewing our ears off from that pulpit !
we're gonna have roast chicken though .
i'm glad of that .
are you gonna start that all over again?
glad this , glad that !
what is all this " glad " business you talk about?
oh , just a game i play .
what kind of a game?
a game my father taught me .
it helps sometimes .
helps what?
when things aren't going so well .
that reverend !
away from the peas .
go away .
folks just hate the coming of sunday because of him .
do you know why i hate sunday?
because it means the starting of another week .
that's true .
that's when you can play the glad game .
here it comes .
miss goody two shoes is gonna find something about sunday to be glad about !
oh , lay off her , angie .
oh , stop it !
if you knew how to play the game , then you could find something to be glad about too .
but you don't !
all right , miss smartie pants , what's so good about sunday?
well , there's always something .
huh !
you could be glad because
well , because what?
because it will be six whole days before sunday comes around again , huh?
that kid .
hi .
why don't you come out of the front door like normal people?
they won't let us .
i can come out anytime i want with my tree .
you can also fall and hurt yourself badly .
you shouldn't play in trees .
that's stupid .
don't you believe in god?
of course i do !
but what's that got to do with it?
he grew it there , didn't he , so i could climb out anytime i want .
you're much too young to go around discussing things you don't know anything about .
he did too !
why else would it be there?
shows you're very juvenile .
you aren't so much , you girl !
besides , i'm somethin 'you can't be .
i'm an orphan .
go away from me , please , little boy .
go away from me , please , little boy .
what is it you want?
i wanna go fishin '.
you wanna come along?
aren't you supposed to use a hook?
i don't have a hook .
oh .
hello .
well , look who's here .
how are you?
fine , thank you .
caught anything?
not yet .
what was it you and my aunt polly fought about?
now , where did you hear about that?
oh , just around .
but they won't discuss it when i'm there .
um , would you mind telling me what it was?
well , pollyanna , it's a strange thing about arguments .
at the time , they seem very important .
but now
you know , i can't even remember what it was about .
huh .
aunt polly's very pretty .
yes , i think she is , don't you?

i think you're just a big bluff !
oh , you do , do you?
well , put that down !
what are you doing touching things?
don't touch anything .
these are my things and i don't want them touched .
it just looks like a lotta old dusty junk to me .
well , you wouldn't know anything about that anyway .
you're nothing but a child .
imagine criticizing a beautiful antique of this kind .
never heard of such a thing .
how'd you do that?
what?
what?
what are you talking about?
that .
how do you make it?
don't you know anything?
i didn't make it .
the sun made it .
that's prismatic reflected light .
where from?
where from?
well , uh
oh , from here .
you see these hanging crystals?
mm hmm .
the sun's rays hit it , and it acts like a prism .
you understand?
sure i understand .
you do not .
you don't know what a prism is .
now , admit it .
it makes a rainbow right on your wall .
isn't it beautiful?
yes , but when the sun sets , it'll be gone .
so stop carrying on so .
sure , but it'll be back again tomorrow when the sun comes again .
you have to admit that .
i don't have to admit anything !
well , i better be going back home now .
well , goodbye , mr pendergast .
it was very nice meeting you .
and thank you for showing me your house .
but i didn't show you my house .
you came barging in here !
goodbye .
kids .
kids today .
well , you always were unpredictable , edmond .
hello , polly .
coming here like this without even calling .
uh , won't you sit down?
could i get you some sherry?
uh , no , thank you .
i ran into your niece down at wompus creek .
we were talking about you and i thought , why not stop by and say hello .
why , that's very nice .
i don't know why pollyanna would be at wompus creek .
oh , she was playing .
she told me you'd be alone today .
there were so many people around the other day , we hardly had a chance to talk .
yes , well , i'm sorry that meeting got out of hand like that .
well , tell me , who have you seen since you've been back?
no one .
you knew that carleen donnelly got married , didn't you?
no .
you remember her brother , beckett donnelly?
no .
of course you do .
you two used to argue all the time .
well , i'm sorry , i don't .
well , it really wasn't that important .
i know what i'll do .
i'll give you a welcoming home party .
it might be nice to see some of the old faces again .
i know that gary and nell would love to see you .
do you know that nell has eight children?
and i think it's the fifth one
polly?
what?
i'm not very good at parties .
please don't .
well , i just thought you might like to see some of your friends .
i came back to see you .
well , that's very flattering .
a busy person like you remembering me .
i came back to see if you were married and what had happened to you .
oh , i'm just the same .
nothing has changed .
everything is  we made a mistake .
i came back to see if you felt the same as i do .
oh , but it's been five years .
you can't just pop out  they were wasted years .
tell me about your work , edmond .
we've heard that you've opened a clinic in baltimore ... and we're very proud of you .
what was it you mentioned yesterday about the orphanage?
i don't remember .
oh , yes , you do .
it was something about the dispensary .
it's inadequate for that number of children .
that's all .
well , i want to modernize it .
will you help us?
just tell us what we need and i'll buy it .
it's a civic responsibility .
why should you buy it?
well , it isn't as if i couldn't afford it .
what does that have to do with it?
well , it's because i want to .
i feel i should .
after all , there is an obligation to having wealth .
haven't you learned yet that people don't like false charity?
well , i don't want to talk about it any more .
i don't know how we got off on this subject .
well , it isn't the way i wanted it .
perhaps i should come again another time .
yes , perhaps you should .
and maybe you should call first?
yes , i'll do that .
pollyanna , look at your new dress .
it's filthy !
and your shoes !
oh , i'm sorry , aunt polly .
i was playing , and i didn't realise .
what were you and dr chilton talking about?
oh !
nothing .
we were talking about your hair .
my hair?
yes .
he said you used to wear it very long and soft , down to your shoulders .
he said it was beautiful !
yes , well , uh clean yourself up for supper , dear .
yes , aunt polly .
here is the last of the calf's foot jelly .
oh , but aunt polly , please  there'll be no nonsense about it , pollyanna .
this is a duty and a job that must be done .
nancy will show you where the deliveries are supposed to be made .
what kind of deliveries?
charity baskets , child .
oh , the suffering in this world !
dwell on it .
appreciate how lucky you are .
now , these two go first , nancy , and handle them with care .
where's the one for mrs snow?
oh .
we took great pains to wrap that attractively , knowing how she is .
yes , ma'am .
and there'll be no dawdling .
and keep your clothes clean for a change .
come on .
off with you .
come on , honey .
we've got three more to go !
oh , just a minute , nancy .
what's in the durn thing?
um , i think that one's calfs 'foot jelly .
oh , you don't have to look at it as though it was charity ... just a gift from one friend to another .
friend?
yes .
i'm your friend .
well , uh , i better be going now .
goodbye .
people sure hate to get charity .
isn't it the truth?
and i don't blame them .
do gooders !
ha !
goodbye , miss ferd .
goodbye .
now , how does that go again?
uh  early one morning just as the sun was rising early one morning just as the sun was rising i heard a maiden singing in the valley below
one up .
early one morning just as the sun was rising i heard a maiden singing
that takes care of mrs gaupherson , miss neely ...
doppsils and the ferds .
who's left?
just this one , mrs snow .
and i wish this one were over with .
what's wrong with her?
she's just plain crabby , that's what's wrong with her .
you never met anyone so cantankerous .
if it was friday , she'd wish it was tuesday .
what'd we bring her today?
uh , calfs 'foot jelly .
you wait and see .
she's bound to wish she had chicken .
and if we brought her chicken , she'd want lamb broth .
she's just cantankerous !
millie?
nancy , come on in .
how are you?
hello , there .
hello .
uh , this is pollyanna whittier .
oh , sure .
i heard you were coming to stay with your aunt .
and this is mrs snow's daughter , mildred .
how do you do?
how do you do?
where were you last night?
we waited and waited .
at the hayride .
i know .
my mother said i could go and at the last minute changed her mind .
she had some kind of , i don't know , an upset stomach .
oh , what a shame .
stop that noise in there !
haven't you any respect for a dying woman?
honestly !
she was so crotchety today .
i'm just worn to a frazzle !
this morning i i fixed her a cup of coffee , as usual .
you know , i brought it in .
she didn't want coffee this morning .
this morning she wanted tea .
i don't know how you stand it .
i swear !
i don't know either .
i poured it down the sink .
i had to make her a new cup of tea .
do you remember the day that that that i brought the currant jelly?
yes !
i had currant jelly from here to there .
she threw it at you !
hello .
who are you?
and what are you doing in my bedroom?
uh , i am pollyanna whittier .
who?
miss harrington's niece .
oh !
the ladies 'aid has sent me with this .
hmm?
what is it?
calfs 'foot jelly .
calfs 'foot jelly !
oh !
and i had my heart set on lamb's broth today .
you mean chicken , don't you?
what's that?
well , they tell me you always wanted chicken when you were brought jelly .
you're a miss impertinence , aren't ya?
come here .
come right over here .
you have a stubby little nose .
what do you think about that?
i know it .
i wish i were pretty like you .
oh , don't you try to butter me up .
i'm not at all pretty .
oh , but you are !
and you don't look sick at all .
well , that shows you what a stupid little girl you are .
well , get outta my way .
why , i'm right on death's doorstep ... just hanging on by sheer will power .
if you had to lay here day after day and day after day , and you call anybody , and your daughter
put that down , stop it .
and she wouldn't come .
she's gallivantin 'somewhere .
and the doctor , all he gives you is pills .
pills and bills .
just pills and bills .
that's all .
what are you staring at?
your prisms .
my what?
your prisms .
did you know they paint rainbows on your wall?
oh .
see?
on that wall over there .
how'd you do that?
well, i said that i'm too old and too smart for that old saw , fred pallegrew .
well , i should say so !
you just turn that horse around and head out from underneath this covered bridge right now .
i'll bet that cooled his heels .
you should've seen his face .
more coffee?
oh , please .
it's awful quiet in there .
i wonder what's going on .
uh , more to your left .
to your left , you silly girl .
what's the matter with you?
now , there .
there .
that's not bad at all .
not bad?
it's gorgeous !
i think it was a fine idea .
now , don't be taking credit .
i suggested stringing them up there .
why , mrs snow , that's a fib .
it was my idea .
it was my idea to use the string !
you didn't know how to do it till i suggested the string .
you're impertinent .
i don't like you at all .
i'm sorry .
when are you coming back again?
tomorrow , i guess .
i'll see you then .
well , if i'm not in my grave .
bye .
bye .
all right , nancy?
goodbye , millie .
goodbye , nancy .
goodbye , pollyanna !
bye .
don't stand there !
go on and fix a cold pack for my headache !
go on !
go on !
yes , mother .
let's get some gumption around here .
let's start acting like a community .
hey , doc , you just sit there chewing on that straw .
put in your two bits 'worth .
what do you think?
i came here to fish , charlie .
i don't want to butt into your affairs here .
ben tarbell?
where are you sneaking off to?
you folks are biting off a pretty big chew with all this talk .
come on , ben .
get it said .
a lot of us have got vested interests in the harrington companies .
our wives belong to her ladies 'aid group .
my woman would skin me alive if i was to go opposite to polly harrington .
and that's the truth !
i'm sorry .
anybody else want to quit , do it now .
all right , then .
let's get our hands out of our hip pockets ... and find a way to raise some money .
are you with me?
yeah .
early one morning just as the sun was rising i heard a maiden singing in the valley below
what's happening?
now , that's the very first thing in the morning .
charlie gorman ... that means eight men assigned to you for carpentry .
dan seymour'll supply the one by twelves .
right , dan?
right .
all right .
now , look , mary , you gotta get that cooking done .
of course , you got that other thing to run .
yes , karl , i'll take care of the chicken .
hi , pollyanna !
hi .
i'll be back in a minute .
hi , honey .
hi .
what's going on?
lady , you are looking at the elected head of the entertainment committee .
old uncle george !
entertainment committee for what?
well
if we get the corn , you can take that whole thing out of there .
charlie , you can count on me to haul in that lumber .
don't have to use the big truck  we're gonna have the best bazaar you've ever seen .
we sure are !
a bazaar?
to raise money for a new orphanage .
it's the first time folks have stood together against polly harrington .
nancy , did you know there's going to be a bazaar?
yes !
with corn on the cob and ice cream and everything !
can kids come , george?
can they come?
well , of course they
george?
now , where'd you get that name?
oh , stop .
she's known it all along .
and you mean you didn't tell your aunt?
well , what did you think i was , a snitch baby?
you're a good girl .
when's it gonna be?
sunday night , a week .
let me tell you about it .
what a night .
an extravaganza .
and i'm in charge of all the acts , all the entertainment .
picture it , ladies .
darkness , and out of the night ... 50 bicycles appear , moving down the square .
and hanging from their handlebars ... 200 200 gorgeous japanese lanterns .
hey , pollyanna , wait for me .
where are you goin '?
there's a big bazaar and i'm helping .
hey , wait a minute .
what's it for?
it's an extravaganza .
picture it .
darkness ... fifty bicycles ... 200 gorgeous japanese lanterns swinging .
and i'll be on the lead bicycle , just riding along , right out in front .
oh , boy .
can i help?
all right .
come on .
where you goin 'now?
mr pendergast's .
you're going back?
you're nutty !
what are you doing back here?
oh , just came to say hello .
tell you something about your prisms .
well , what about them?
well , aren't you going to invite me in?
invite you in?
no more privacy than a goldfish .
all right .
come in , come in .
but you can't stay long .
can he come in too?
can who come in?
jimmy bean !
come on .
don't be a scare baby !
oh , come on !
don't touch anything .
well , why didn't you just invite the whole town while you were at it?
oh , i just wanted to show jimmy the rainbow on your wall .
do you mind?
all right .
go ahead , go ahead .
kids they'll drive you crazy .
one thing or another .
it's getting so a man ... can't call his home his own any more .
and where do you think it comes from?
through this piece of glass .
explain it to him , mr pendergast .
i've got work to do .
don't you know anything about refracted light , there , boy?
it's the sunlight coming through
i'll do the explaining if you don't mind , little miss know it all .
now , boy , you see here , the
don't they ever cut your hair in that darn orphanage?
i like it the way it is .
look at you .
so much hair , you look like you're wearing a coonskin cap .
lemme go , will ya?
anyway ... about the refracted light .
oh yes .
now pay attention , boy .
you see the shape of this crystal?
that is a prism .
the light is stripped by that angle .
that refracts the ray ... splits the colours , diffuses them in an oblique angle ... and bends it out into a dispersed colour band .
you understand?
what he means is ... the sun comes through here and paints a rainbow .
you see?
oh , i understand !
can i try it once , please?
go ahead , but don't break anything .
do you know mrs snow?
well , i've just come from her place .
and we strung a whole bunch of them up across her window .
you should see what that does !
let's try it .
all right .
oh no , i've got work to do .
if we had some wire or a piece of thread ... we could string 'em up across the whole window .
oh , we could , could we?
do you kids think ...
i've got nothing better to do than to play silly games?
well , don't stand there looking at me like that .
there's string in that box over there .
go and get it , go and get it .
oh , dear , dear , dear .
oh , my goodness !
look !
look .
see over here?
look on the door !
it's on the door .
can't you see?
look !
oh , it's gorgeous !
it's the most beautiful room in the entire world .
not bad , is it?
it's not bad at all .
that dining room looks awfully gloomy .
why don't we do the same thing in there?
oh , boy !
let's go !
no .
what do you mean , " no "?
i thought you enjoyed it .
well , it's what i came to see you about , mr pendergast .
you see , they're having a big bazaar in town ... and they're trying to raise enough money to build a new orphanage .
i like the old one .
be still .
anyway , they need help .
and everyone's supposed to bring somebody else .
and i want to bring you .
what for?
they're having all kinds of stands to sell things hooked rugs , quilts and crocheted tablecloths .
and we can have a stand and sell these !
rainbow makers !
i'll bet everyone would buy one .
i never go into town , and i don't believe in community projects .
but they need you !
they need me?
of course , they are sort of attractive little things , aren't they?
i just wonder if folks would buy a thing like this .
i wonder .
now , i'm not trying to sell you the brass , but it is durable .
well , the silver's pretty , and i think you're right about the brass .
oh , i don't know .
i just can't make up my mind .
of course , the effect of silver is always in good taste .
hi , mrs snow .
well , where have you been , you naughty girl?
oh , i'm sorry .
i've been helping for the bazaar .
hello , mr murg .
how do you do?
what've you got there?
don't bring those dirty rags in here !
get them off my bed !
oh , they aren't dirty rags .
they're patchwork squares .
mrs gaupherson made them .
i thought perhaps you'd like to stitch them together ... to make a patchwork quilt for the bazaar .
what an impertinent child !
listen .
you just take them right out of here !
i'm not gonna do anything of the sort !
but everyone's helping
mr neely , the julians , and even old mrs thurm .
oh .
she wants me to work in my condition .
don't bother mrs snow , girl .
she's a very sick woman !
well , i thought it might give you something to do instead of just lying around .
i mean , the bazaar's for an awfully good cause .
well , it's a waste of time .
nobody'll come to it .
you wait and see .
that's right .
why not?
because because of your aunt , that's why not .
well , i don't understand .
well , we do , don't we , mr murg?
indeed we do .
good .
well .
now , about this white satin .
i think it's lovely .
this this is my first choice .
and i think the best one .
yeah .
it'll look lovely against the brass handles .
are you having a dress made?
don't be impertinent !
i'm pickin 'the lining for my coffin .
that's right .
but you're not gonna die !
does she have to be here?
go on into the kitchen and talk to mildred .
now
now , this satin is lovely .
well , it's all settled then .
thirteen yards of the white satin ... at $ 1 . 20 the yard .
and the brass coffin handles .
well , all right , all right .
write it up .
stop frowning at me like that !
what's the matter with you?
well , it's just that ... well , a person shouldn't think about dying so much !
i don't want you to die .
oh , bless you for that .
it seems everyone else can't wait .
i'm not supposed to talk about my father at home ... but i guess it's all right here .
my father used to say , a person should think about living .
why don't you go outside and play?
hush up .
i want to hear what she has to say .
yes .
mrs snow .
yes .
it just reminded me about my father and the doll .
you see , i always wanted a doll ... but we never had enough money for things like that .
my father was a minister .
but surely he could afford a little thing like a doll .
well , he couldn't .
we had to have the money for food .
oh , for heaven's sake !
shh !
so anyway , my father wrote to the missionary people ... and asked them to please send a little secondhand doll .
well , there was a funny mistake .
when the missionary barrels came ... instead of a doll , they sent a pair of crutches .
well , of course , i was rather disappointed .
so my father made up the glad game .
the what game?
she's been pestering folks all over town with this sunshine and happiness thing .
hearts and flowers .
enough to make you sick .
hush up !
i want to hear it .
certainly .
anyway , about the crutches ... my father said , " don't let's be gloomy .
let's try to find something to be glad about .
so we made a game of it the glad game !
" the glad game " !
shh !
so anyway , we played the game ... and after a while i forgot about the doll and being gloomy .
and you know what?
i found a reason for being glad .
well , there's nothing happy about a pair of crutches .
well , we were glad that we didn't have to use them !
why must you bedevil this poor dying woman ... with your childish , silly little stories?
i just thought she could play the game !
you could be glad you don't need this horrid old coffin !
you could help others by making the patchwork quilt for the orphans if you wanted .
you ought to forget about dying and be glad you're living !
oh , i don't care what you do .
i'm not gonna come and see you any more .
i i didn't mean to hurt her feelings .
she's serious about it , isn't she?
oh , please , please , mr murg .
leave me alone .
i'm sorry if i've  please .
please leave me alone .
ben told me yesterday they've been organizing , about 50 of them .
and ed chilton's got a finger in the pie too !
edmond?
gave them the idea is what he did .
and that's not all .
it couldn't have been nancy .
i tell you , she was there .
jesse told me .
i'd fire that girl so fast , it would make her head swim .
and that child , your own niece , helping them !
pollyanna?
just a moment .
mrs tarbell tells me you're involved with that bazaar .
well , i won't have it .
but , aunt polly , i'm part of the flag .
we won't discuss it .
i don't want you to see those people any more ... and that's an order !
yes , ma'am .
the blessings you've heaped on that child , and her working with those people against you .
get down my cake tins , angie .
we're going to work .
doin 'what?
thinks she's the queen of sheba , does she?
well , she can't stop us from helping with that bazaar !
we're gonna bake cakes , dozens and dozens of'em !
where are you gonna get the ingredients?
where do you think?
you're getting paid , aren't you?
not to be kicked .
he kicked me in the stomach .
now, jimmy , you've got to stop kicking mr hooper and sit still .
i don't want to get my hair cut !
hey, jed .
get that hammer out back , and we'll nail his shoes to the chair !
hey .
mr pendergast .
you should be ashamed of yourself , ben tarbell !
i paid for the tickets .
will you let it go at that , karl?
i just can't show up at your affair .
you ain't the only one , ben .
what do you mean by that?
well , i just came from your newspaper office .
what's the matter with those fellows?
they said they couldn't handle this ad for our bazaar .
will you go over and straighten them out?
ah , take it easy , doc .
our space is all sold , and i can't go around
tell him the truth .
why lie to the man?
you're a coward !
it isn't baltimore up here , doc .
this is a small town .
and you know as well as everybody else our newspaper's owned by the harrington family .
liver bellied bunch of miserable sheep !
that's what you all are .
well , take it easy , pendergast .
it's the way things are .
i say that you're all chicken livered !
and i'm sick and tired of
just a minute ! just a minute !
the thing is this .
most folks around here make a living outta polly harrington , some way or another .
we can't afford to antagonize her .
can't afford to antagonize her?
just don't be surprised if come sunday night nobody shows up at your bazaar .
i don't believe that .
well , you're comin ', aren't ya?
claire?
charlie?
people are just plain scared to , karl .
they're afraid of polly harrington paying 'em back later .
she'll do it too .
you know her .
now , look .
we've all taken a cut or two at the harringtons ... but she wouldn't do a thing like that .
if you think i'm intimidating a whole town  oh , polly , you know what i mean .
no one will make a move in this town without the harrington stamp of approval on it .
oh !
karl warren sent you , didn't he?
he knew no one would cooperate without me .
nobody sent me .
i just wanted it made clear you don't mind if the others cooperate .
you needed my help .
why don't you admit it?
won't let your guard down for a minute , will you?
still suspicious .
still don't trust anyone .
nothing's changed , has it , polly?
you're still as opinionated as ever , if that's what you mean .
oh , angelica ...
dr chilton is leaving .
keep busy , polly .
lots of meetings and civic duties and obligations .
it's a poor substitute for what's really wrong with you .
i knew i could count on you for some lofty clinical observations .
would you like to be paid for your diagnosis?
this one's on the house .
there's no medical term for it .
you can give everything but love .
it's as simple as that .
angelica?
ma'am?
see that the flowers in the conservatory get fresh water .
i found them dry again today .
yes , ma'am .
did ya hear how he told her off?
like water off a duck's back to her .
that woman's got no feelings at all !
how'd it go , ed?
stubborn , mule headed woman . just like her father .
i should have known better .
what did she say?
a lot of foolish nonsense .
what she really wants is for us to go begging to her ... get her sanction , permission from the queen to gather in the streets .
hi , nancy .
hi , dear .
what's the matter?
oh , nothing .
it's a doggone shame , after all the work folks put into it .
is the bazaar off?
it looks that way .
why?
you wouldn't understand .
is it because of aunt polly?
yes .
it takes a word from someone , someone who isn't under her thumb .
fat change you got , ed .
she's got her finger in nearly everything the bank , the mills , the paper , real estate .
harrington town .
a fine thing , one woman owning a town .
well , like it or not , that's what she does .
nancy .
yes?
she doesn't own the church .
that's right .
what did you say?
um , i just said that nobody could own a church .
our social structure in this small town seems to teeter on a delicate balance ... one which which i certainly cannot in any way attempt to influence .
a a man of god cannot be taking sides in these feuds .
but all we want is a word from you , reverend .
no .
if you'd just let the people know tomorrow you're in favour of us .
no , no , no .
i won't use that pulpit for public announcements .
then you're siding with her by not mentioning it .
i am not !
i'm staying completely out of it , and that's all there is to it .
reverend ford , if you'd just let us say that you're in favour .
there's nothing more to discuss .
this is all just impossible .
i'm afraid you're right .
thank you , reverend ford .
you see , i of course , you understand that
personally i think it's a good cause and all that , and and i wish you luck with it .
thanks a lot .
i guess pollyanna was wrong .
now , what has she got to do with this?
she said nobody could own a church .
hello , mrs ford .
hello , dear .
what are you doing here?
aunt polly sent me .
uh , something for reverend ford .
oh , he's just back up there .
oh , yes , i saw him .
thank you .
it's a lovely day , isn't it?
yes , it is .
and he sayeth unto them ... the wicked shall be punished .
the wicked shall be punished .
their poison is like the poison of serpents .
but they shall feel the gall of asps within them .
how many times have i stood on this pulpit ... and warned you , cautioned you again and again
a house divided against itself cannot stand .
a kingdom divided against itself can be brought to desolation .
if you are an enemy to one another ... then you are an enemy to god !
am i reaching out to you?
do you understand my words?
well
week after week , i stand here reaching out to you ... begging you to understand .
yet , week after week ... the same wickedness persists ... the same dissension ... the same belligerence , the same feuding ... until you are ten thousand times ... more abominable in the eyes of god ... than the most hateful , venomous , violent , vicious
you !
what are you doing here?
oh , nothing .
um , i mean , i was looking for you .
uh , aunt polly sent you this .
now , what is it?
uh , i don't know .
i'm sorry i disturbed your practise .
would you like someone to practise your sermon on?
no .
no , thank you , child .
uh , mother and i used to be an audience to my father ... when he was practising his sermons .
he he was a minister too , you know .
oh , yes , yes .
so he was .
uh , do you like being a minister?
do i like being a m
now , why would you ask a thing like that?
oh , the way you looked just then reminded me of my father .
once i saw him sorta sad like that , and i asked him .
and what did he say?
oh .
oh , said he was glad he was .
but it made him sad sometimes .
just couldn't seem to get through to his congregation .
sounds familiar .
i suppose every minister of god faces the same problem .
mm , i suppose .
tell me , did your father ever solve the problem?
well , he read something one day that he said helped him .
in the bible?
no , just something he read someplace .
he had it put on this chain .
he wore it always .
it's all i have of his .
when you look for the bad
ooh !
it always makes me cross eyed .
may i?
when you look for the bad in mankind expecting to find it ... you surely will .
abraham lincoln .
he was the president .
yes .
yes , i know .
but i never heard that before .
neither had my father .
anyway , he said it started him thinking .
and from then on , he was gonna look for the good in people .
that's when we both started searching the bible for the texts .
the texts?
yes .
you know .
my father called them " the glad passages .
you know , the happy ones like ... um , uh , " shout for joy " ... or " be glad in the lord .
you know , like that .
there are 800 happy texts .
did you know that?
no , i didn't know that .
yes , well , there are .
and you know , my father said ...
if god took the trouble to tell us 800 times to be glad and rejoice ... he must've wanted us to do it .
oh , i'd better be going now .
i'm sorry i disturbed your practising .
i'll see you later .
uh , goodbye .
goodbye , reverend ford .
dear reverend ...
i've taken the liberty of jotting down a few thoughts ... and some text from matthew ... which i thought you might want to use in your sermon tom
oh , my god .
what have i done?
what have i done?
dear , are you all right?
nobody owns a church .
no one .
apocrypha .
ecclesiasticus 30 ... paragraph 22 .
gladness of the heart is the life of man .
this is one of the rejoicing ... or happy texts .
ayoung member of our parish pointed out to me ... that there are 800 such happy texts in our bible .
well , she was wrong .
there are , to be exact ...
826 .
i know , because i stayed up most of last night counting them .
i intend to read one of them every week .
and that should take us , according to my calculations , through 1 6 years ... if i'm around here that long .
but i can promise you this .
if i am here ... our visits with god on sunday are going to be happier ... and more rejoicing too .
eh .
now , what i have to say now ... is very difficult for me .
but it must be said .
i look out to you now ... and realize ... after four years in this congregation ...
i don't even know you .
i look out to you now not as my congregation ... but as people .
and i say to myself , how sad it is to have missed those four years ... four years when we could've been friends .
i should have been looking for the good in you .
and i i failed you .
i
and i apologize for this .
god is forgiving , but it's not god's forgiveness i beg , it is yours .
i'm i'm not gonna speak about this any more now .
it's a lovely day outside .
so let's go outside and enjoy this sunday for a change .
and while you're out appreciating the sunlight , just ... give a little thought to who's sending it down to you .
eh .
oh , stop , please .
one more thing , please !
please sit down .
please . just one more thing .
i'm sorry .
there's to be a charity bazaar in the band park tonight .
it's for a good cause .
and , um , i want to go on record ... as being 1 00 percent for it .
so let's all go out there and have ourselves some fun ... because , um ... well , if you're not there
let me put it this way .
if you're not there ...
i'll lam into you something fierce when i get you in here next week !
and you know i can do it too !

if you don't mind , i'd like to speak to all of you in the salon for a moment .
nancy , when miss pollyanna feels better ...
i want you to move all of my clothes and my personal belongings into the next room .
yes , ma'am .
i want her to stay where she is .
it's a larger room , and it has a much nicer view .
and it looks as though she's going to have to remain there for quite some time .
you might as well know that pollyanna's legs are paralyzed .
she doesn't know it yet , and i don't know exactly how i'm going to tell her .
i just don't know how i'm going to tell her .
i came as soon as i heard .
eh , how is the child?
pollyanna !
come on down and play !
pollyanna !
we'll go swimmin '.
want to?
pollyanna !
boy !
boy !

hurry up .
go on .
hurry up .

god works in ways mysterious to man .
don't speak to me about god !
say what you think .
i can see it in your eyes .
they blame me , don't they?
no .
no , nobody's blaming you .
it's true , isn't it?
i could have been the least bit understanding .
that child lies up there because of me .
polly , the mercy of god is forgiving  oh , what kind of a merciful god ... could allow a thing like this to happen to a child?
and if he were merciful , why did he let her come to our town?
let me tell you something , polly harrington .
sunday a miracle happened in this town .
oh , this town !
yes , this town .
right out there in that street the people are smiling at one another .
go on .
take a look for yourself .
it's very contagious .
just think , polly .
if she had never come to this town
we ought to get down on our knees and thank god for sending her to us .
excuse me , ma'am .
dr chilton wants to see you .
now , you understand everything i told you , don't you , dear?
and there's nothing to be afraid of .
what is it , edmond?
i told pollyanna about her injury .
she understands .
don't you , dear?
we're going to take you to baltimore for an operation so you can walk again .
you hear that , honey?
i know .
why don't we all cheer up?
let's see if we can't find something to be glad about your staying in bed .
um , oh , i know .
this way we can all have steak and ice cream .
did you know that your aunt ordered it for you?
now you find something to be glad about .
we'll play the game .
well
i suppose i could be glad because
yes?
go ahead , darling .
no .
it was a silly game .
i hate it .
i never want to play it again .
leave me alone .

nancy and angelica , mrs lagerlof .
and i love you as if you were my own little girl .

i want complete x rays the minute we arrive .
yes .

is the operation dangerous?
yes , it's very delicate .
you're coming , aren't you?
i need your permission to operate .
edmond .
there's something worrying you , and i want to know what it is .
we can only do so much with surgery .
a great deal depends on her .
this depression she's got herself into .
that's what's worrying me .
edmond .
she's had a shock .
she's just learned about her legs .
i can't have her despondent like this for the operation .
well , you have to give her time .
time?
there is no time .
i have to move her , get her into the hospital , and i don't like it .
what that child needs is a good shot in the arm of hope .
hope?
what she really needed was love .

we can still give her that love .

like she brought into ours , god love her .
we just want her to know she's got friends , lots of them .
