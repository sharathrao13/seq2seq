well , this blistering academic schedule shouldn 't get inyour way .
you should be happy about that .
why can't you accept the fact that i'm not a genius?
itjust kills you that i'm not an honor student .
no .
it kills me that you barely make time to study .
ifyoustudied halfasmuch asyou cheer , you'dbe in greatshape .
your priorities are no !
those are your priorities !
mine arejust fi ne .
look ,
i'm just saying that college might be less ofa shock ... ifyou take an extra lab or language course or something .
what do you think?
will advanced chem get you off my back?
not completely , but it'll help .
done .
you know , mothers have killed to get their daughters on squads .
that mother didn't kill anyone .
she hired a hit man .

i mean , what is that , from like the 1900s?
nobody does that anymore .
i don't think anybody does .
when i lived in kentucky did they still do the loser sneeze in kentucky?
no .
they had , uh , guns and homemade bombs .
what about l. a.?
there wasattitude in l. a. , but no losersneeze .
i'm pretty sure the loser sneeze is officially dead .
sorry .

i don't think they got the memo about the loser sneeze .
uh , no , apparently not .
cliff .
torrance .
advanced chem .
yikes .
um , 'fraid so .

y yeah , a little .
really?
no , not really .
so , is that your band or something?

it's a british punk band , circa 1977 to 1983 ish .
original lineup , anyway .
how vintage .
um , so i'll seeyou aroundthen?
looks like it .
hey , hey , hey , hey .
whoa !

besides , they're dicks .

torrance , it's only the second day ofschool , and your academic insecurity bit is completely tired .

carver will strictly be cheering in special olympics until march .
nationals are february 10th .
regionals are in , like , four weeks .
i talked to her .

look , we're gymnasts too , except no beam , no bars , no vault .
sorry .

what are you doing?
nothin '.
i just thought that it was interesting hearing torrance's point ofview .
how do you even know her?
we're old friends .
ever been to a cheerleading competition?
oh , you mean like a football game?
no , not a game .
those are like practices for us .
i'm talking about a tournament .
espn cameras all around , hundreds of people in the crowds cheering .
wait .
people cheering cheerleaders?
that's right .
lots of people .
here's the deal , missy .
we're the shit .
the best .
we have fun , we work hard , and we win national championships .
i'm offering you a chance to be a part ofthat .
thinkabout it , miss .
youget to wear sassy outfits .
you get to yell like you care about something .
she's not the cheering type .
you know what?
count me in .
ready , girls?
i said brrr it's cold in here
i said there must be some toros in the atmosphere
i said brrr it's cold in here
isaid there must besome torosin the atmosphere
i said oh ee , oh ee , oh ice , ice , ice
oh ee , oh ee , oh lce , ice , ice
here we go , girls .
hey , practice isn 't overyet .
nice recruit , torrance .
a real captain would've seen what i saw : a big dykey loser .
i'd say that's strike two .
what is up?
i went out on a limb foryou , and you bail?
i'm not about stealing .
what are you talking about?
you ripped off those cheers .
listen , missy , our cheers are 100 % original .
count the trophies .
well , your trophies are bullshit , because you're a sad ass liar .
all right , that's it !
get out ofthe car !
i'm gonna kickyour ass !
oh , really?
come on .
you're in for a rude awakening .

ready to share those trophies?
can wejust beat these buffys down so i can go home?
i'm on curfew , girl .
there's no need for that .
she's right .
see , then we'd be doing them a favor .
then they could feel good about sending raggedy ann here tojack us for our cheers .
raggedy ann?
ugly redhead with a video camera attached to her hand .
y'all been coming up here foryears , trying to steal our routines .
and wejust love seeing them on espn .
what are you talking about?
brr , it's cold in here .
i said there must be some toros in the atmosphere "?
you don't think a white girl made that shit up .
i i
our free cheer service is over as ofthis moment .
over !
finito !
everytime we getsome , herey'all come , tryin 'to steal it , puttin 'blond hair on it and calling it something different .
we've had the best squad around foryears , but no one's been able to see what we can do .
but you better believe all that's gonna change this year .
i'm captain , and i guarantee you we'll make it to nationals .
handoverthe tape you made tonight and we'll callit even fornow .
we don't have any tape .
really .
wejust came to see the show .
what?
come on , lsis .
let me do this .
you know what?
let'sgo .
wait a minute .
so that's it?
we'rejust gonna let them go?
yeah , because unlike them , we have class .
i swear i had no idea .
i swear i had no idea .
well , now you do .
hmmph .
you been touched by an angel , girl .
jenelope , let'sgo .
wejust so almost got our asses kicked back there !
i mean , i knew i'd seen those routines before .
we usedtoplay east compton all the time .
you really had no idea , did you?
do you know what this means?
my entire cheerleading career has been a lie .
well , look on the bright side .
it's only cheerleading .
i am only cheerleading .
do you believe in curses?
what are you talking about?
i think i'm cursed .
and why is that?
this past summer at cheer camp , all the new seniors had to do a dare .
see , there's this thing calledthespirit stick , andit can never , evertouch theground .
torrance shipman , your mission , should you choose to accept it and you better is to capture the spirit stick ... anddrop it in front ofthe entire camp .
doyou wannago my way
doyou wannago my way
the future is clear let'sget intogear
y'all are such an inspiration to us .
well , i just wanted to congratulate you guys and take a picture ofyou ...
with the spirit stick .
here .
doyou wannago my way
doyou wannago my way here .
i don't want it now .
no , it's okay .
the spirit stick doesn't lose anything .
the person who drops it , however , [ deep voice ]
goes to hades !
i don't mean to laugh , but cheerleading urban legends?
you're notjinxed .
shit happens .
i have to tell you something .
i'm on the phone , creep .
i realize that , and normally i'd be listening on the other line , but this is important .
okay , what?
ohh !
get out !
thankyou for listening .
yo .
back later .
is aaron around?
do you know when?
no .
have him call torrance .
it's urgent .
all right .
big red totally screwed us !
i mean monster screwed us !
i put this to the entire squad .
swearyou guys didn't know .
big red didn't exactly let any of us help with the routines , torrance .
i cannot believe she did this .
i feel awful .
it's depraved .
i mean , those east compton girls wanted to grill our asses .
big redran theshow , man .
we werejust flying ignorami , forsobbing out loud .
we can't go to regionals with a stolen routine .
it's too risky .
changing the routine now ... would be total murder suicide .
seriously .
let's not put the " duh " in " dumb .
how are east compton gonna prove anything?
you people are unbelievable .
i mean , we're talking about cheating here .
sorry , new girl , but nobody hit your buzzer .
look , lhate to bepredictable , but ldon't give a shit .
we learned that routine fair and square .
we logged the man hours .
don't punish the squad for big red's mistake .
this isn't about cheating .
this is about winning .
everyone in favor ofwinning?
iget whatyou're saying , missy , but there's no time .
ifwe don't do the routine , we've got nothing else .
so , you in?
whatever .
get out of here !
hey , this is the living room .
it's public domain .
yo .
hey , may i please speak to aaron?
it's torrance .
he's not here .
he's , uh he's not here .
bye .
ohh !
i'll take " famous losers " for 200 , alex .
shut up , moron !
it's not my fault you're in love with a big gay cheerleader who won't return your phone calls .
aaron is not gay .
oh , so someonejust made him become a cheerleader?
he'sjust ... busy !
yeah , busy scamming on guys .

all the cheerleaders in the world wouldn't help our football team .

because we're such fi ne athletes .
oh , live with it .
you'll be fi ghting off major oglers while we defend our sexuality .

oh , fluently .
and courtney and whitney " dyke adelic "?

where have you been?
i keep trying to call you .
yeah , i know .
i've been , like , totally busy with school and practice and stuff .
what's up?
oh , it's bad , aaron .
miss red snaked our routines from the east compton clovers .
all ofour routines .
what?
they found out .
they showed up at the game .
gauntlets were thrown .
tell me you didn't know about this .
i don't know what to do here .
ofcourse i didn't know , but you gotta calm down .
this is not that big a deal .
everybody uses everybody else's material .
it's like this unwritten rule or something .
that doesn 't help me .
we can't do theirroutine at regionals because they're gonna do theirroutine .
come on , tor , you need a new routine .
that's all .
no problem .
just hire a professional choreographer .
a choreographer?
look , just think of it as collaboration .

y'allready forthis
great .
thanks for coming .
we're don't speak .
you .
you have weak ankles .
one ofyour calves is bigger than the other .
too much makeup .
not enough makeup .
what's with the skin?
sunlight " !
male cheerleaders .
enough said .
smile .
don't smile .
chicken .
good general tone and musculature .
report those compliments to your ass before it gets so big ... it forms its own web site .
and you , i take you to be the captain , which means you'll probably need more work than anyone .
look , you don't but shh !
no , no , no .
don't speak .
don't think .
listen and learn .
i'm a choreographer .
that's what i do .
you ... are cheerleaders .
cheerleaders are dancers who have gone retarded .
whatyou do is a tiny , pathetic subset ofdancing .
i will attempt to transform your robotic routines into poetry ... written with the human body .
follow me or perish , sweater monkeys .
i wantyou to think ofwhatyou ate today .
got it?
now cut that in half .
this is called a diet .
everyone start one today .
darcy , honey , you should stop eating .
you see , when you skip a meal , your body feeds off its fat stores .
and ifyou skip enough , maybe your body will eat your ass .
why does everyone have togo on a diet?
because in cheerleading , we throw people in the air , and fat people don't go as high .
come on , come on .
let'sget back to work !
ah !
i want dangerous !
i wanna feellikesomebody's gonna snap theirneck !
spirit fingers !
give mespirit fingers !
spirit fi ngers .
give me spirit !
ouch !
what?
i told you i'd catch you .
look , i understand you have underwear up your ass right now , but it beats the hell out ofa shattered skull .
think about it .
okay , now , spirit fi ngers .
spirit fi ngers !
andspirit fingers !
oh , my god !
these are not spirit fi ngers .
these are spirit fi ngers .
and these ... are gold .
one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight .
one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight .
screw this .
i did not sign on for spirit fi ngers .
come on !
the spirit fi ngers are great !
yeah , whatever .
we are so screwed .
hey .
what's the matter?
hey .
you don't wanna know .
ah .
cheer crisis .
i'vejust gotten so bogged down in all this ... crap .
well , if it's crap , why do you do it?
i don't know .
so quit .
maybe i should .
yeah , i mean , ifyou don't like it anymore .
i didn't say that .
sounds like it .
i don't know what i want .
irememberback when lcheeredat myschoolin detroit .
you cheered at your other high school?
no , i never cheered , but i know what you're going through .
and regardless ofall the politics and the doubts ... and the crap , you just have to know that you can do it .
and if it helps ,
i know you can .
you do?
yeah .
allright , allright !
i'm ready to make a foolofmyself .
state regionals , here we come .

oww !
she did not just hit me !
she's a little kid .

leave me alone !
stop it , courtney !
hi .
you , yes .
your head was down .
your head was down during that move .
how are you gonna give a proper score ... ifyour head is down during a move?
remember , they give extra points for alacrity and effulgence .
did we bring those?
oh , no .
look who's here .
hi .
we're in trouble .
andnow , making theirfirst appearance at the u. c. a. california regionals , the east compton clovers !
yeah , clovers !
i'm standing here with five time national returning champions , the rancho carne toros .
leading the squad this year is senior torrance shipman .
torrance , one ofthe things we've come to expect ... from the toros over the last fewyears is a highly originalroutine .
can we expect thesame thisyear?
well ,
i think everyone goes out there the same way , being as prepared as they can be and just hoping for the best .
we'rejust glad to be back here ... and eager to see what other squads have come up with .
prepare fortotaldomination !
domination !
domination !

didn't wejust see this routine?
y'allready forthis
what the f
ahem .
the rancho carne toros , ladies andgentlemen .
go , toros !
did they screw up .
that was , um , interesting .
nicejob !
y'all should'vejust stuck with our routines .
yeah .
don't worry .
we'll send you a postcard from nationals .
six , seven , eight .
next up , the fighting beavers ofsan bernardino .
torranceshipman?
yes .
tad freeman , universal cheer association .
we have a problem .
a problem?
oh , yes , a verybigproblem .
hey .
idon't know ifyou can imagine ...
hey . the incredible sense ofdeja vu lexperiencedasl was watching that last routine .
it tends to make me suspicious i wouldn'tjust now .
what?
official cheer business .
come on .
it's me .
hey , torrance !
you see , i [ mouthing words ]
that was smooth .
real smooth .
i'll see her later .
all righty .
oh , uh , by the way , nice spirit fi ngers .
yeah .
well , here's another .
thanks .
obviously your toros aren't the only squad with this particular routine .
does the name sparky polastri mean anything to you?
sparky polastri?
mm hmm .
apparently he's been peddling this same routine up and down the california coast .
six squads total .
we're holding an emergency session ofthe discretionary panel .
about what?
we've never had a situation like this before .
we really should disqualify you and no , don't punish the squad .
it was my choice to hire sparky , not theirs .
don't penalize everyone for my bad judgment .
but since there's no precedent for this , there's nothing in the rule books that forbids it .
it's simply frowned upon , and i suppose we can't disqualify you on those grounds alone .
as defending champions , you are guaranteed a bid to florida , but know that we'll be watching you .
and don't expect to show up at fi nals with that routine .
taking the floornow
what areyou doing?
you're wrecking everything lbuilt !
it's not totally herfault .
ihookedup
this season should have been gravy , okay?
i handpicked the squad , i delivered an idiot proof routine .
platter , nationals , hello !
don't you mean a stolen routine?
oh .
don't be so naive , torrance .
look , the truth is i was a real leader , okay?
i did what i had to do to win at nationals , and ever since i handed the reins over to you , you've run my squad into the ground !
if i made any mistake as a squad leader , it wasn't borrowing cheers .
it was announcing you as my successor .
uh uh .
not cool .
hey , tor .
tor .
wait , wait , wait , wait , wait .
let me go .
i just wanna get out of here .
hey , big red's a bitch .
we all know that .
even she knows that .
i don't know what to do here , aaron .
look .
i know i haven't always been there foryou since i went to college .
it's been a rough transition , for both of us .
but i still care about you as much as i ever did .
you know that , right?
you do?
ofcourse .
which is why i hate to see you like this , all stressed out .
it's not good foryou .
you're a great cheerleader , tor , and you're cute as hell .
it'sjust that maybe [ sighs ]
maybe ... you'rejust not captain material , and there's nothing wrong with that .
maybe you should consider letting courtney and whitney take over the squad .
they'rejust like big red .
you want me to give up captain?
hey , let them deal with the politics .
you just do what you do best , tor .
you cheer .
cheer , tor .
okay?
i just wanna see you happy .
bye .
mm .
mmm .
sleep tight , sweetie .
friend ofyours?
he's my boyfriend .
look , cliff , i can explain .
no .
it's cool .
here , um , i made you a tape too .
cliff
hey , torrance , uh , it's me , cliff .
um , here's , uh
i wrotesomething , uh , foryou , so here it is .
oh , torrance
can't stand yourcheerleading squad
but ilove yourpom poms
i'dfeedyou bonbons allnight
one , two , three , four !
yeah , yougot me to feel all those butterflies inside
inyourlockerl wouldhide the truth
it's onlyyou lsee
andyou'rejust what lneed
i'dbringyou flowers everyday
just to rollyou in the hay
well , i'm feelin 'fine i'm right on time
iknowl'llget my way
andyou'rejust what lneed
andyou'rejust what lneed
not everything works asit seems
is thatso hard to believe
'causeyou'rejust what lneed
andyou'rejust what lneed
not everything works asit seems
is thatso hard to believe
yeah
aaron called us last night .
he told us you're turning the squad over to us .
just because you bit the big one as captain , does not mean we're gonna be super hard on you .
oh .
we'll treat you as ifyou ... didn't screw us into the ground .
gee , thanks .
everyone .
torrance is not to be harmed .
we've already decided on a course ofaction .
we're gonna forego nationals this year .
everyone's already agreedto it .
uh , except me .
and me !
both ofyou can be replaced .
lcan't believeyouguys .
the onlyperson who can officially resign thepost ofcaptain is the captain , and i'm not going anywhere .
then we'll have to overthrow you .
which we will !
enough !
our whole cheering career , we've stakedourreputation on being the best , the most inventive .
now we fi nally have a chance to truly be original , and you're all running scared .
she's crazy .
iam not crazy , and i'm not resigning as captain either .
you're gonna have to kill me fi rst .
that can be arranged .
shut it , whitney !
let her talk !
look , lknowl've screwedup royally as captain , but lbelieve in this squad , andlknow we can bounce backfrom this .
i'm not saying it's gonna be easy .
it's gonna be hard work .
we need a new routine , something amazing and fresh , and we've got less than three weeks till nationals , but ifwe can do it , ifwe can pull this off , then we can really call ourselves original .
now who's with me?
all right !
yeah .
yeah !
yeah !
how 'bout it , girls?
it's gonna be hard without you two .
fine .
sure .
whatever .
okay .
let's do this .
we're gonna devote every waking hourtopractice before school , in between classes andafterschool .
afternoonpractices willhave to be twice aslong .
we've gotta do whateverit takes to be in perfectphysicalshape .
yeah .
you can go a little harder .
yeah , that feelsgood .
maybe we should join the squad .
push .
oh , yeah .
fag !
andsince the football team sucks no matterhowhard we cheer , we'll use nightgames topractice too .
but that's not all .
we're gonna study othertypes ofmovement , from swing dance ... to interpretive dance , ... you grow and you grow and you bloom ! even mime .
we'lldrawinspiration from martialarts , hah ! musicals , everything .
youguys know we've got the talent .
we'vejustgotta work ourasses offandtrust ourinstincts all ofourinstincts .
tor !
wha wow !
what are you doing here?
just wanted to come by and see you .
is this a bad time?
yeah .
yeah , yeah , yeah .
i'm super busy .
i'm workin 'on this project
yeah , you sound super busy .
i guess that's it .
you were too busy to believe in me .
oh .
no , no , but wait .
you weren't too busy to sell me out to courtney and whitney , were you?
gee , now i'm confused .
well , i hope you're not too busy to hear this .
kiss my ass , aaron !
it's over !
you're a great cheerleader , aaron .
it'sjust that ... maybe you're not exactly boyfriend material .
bye bye .
you're a cheerleader?
u. c. a. just posted the nationals list on the lnternet .
east compton isn't on it .
they couldn 't raise the money in time .
they're not going .
what do you mean , " they're not going "?
torrance , that'sgoodnews .
they cannot not go .
that's not good news .
what are you talking about?
they don't go , we win .
once again we're the best .
i defi ne best as competing against the best there is out there and beating them .
they have to go .
it's so unfair .
the fi rst inner city squad to get a bid , and they can't afford to go?
look , mom .
her head is spinning off into another dimension .
justin !
the company gets hit up for money all the time , honey .
i just can't .
it's not that much money , mr. level playing field .
tell them the deal .
maybe they'll wanna help .
yeah?
okay , i'll make the call , but they'll probably say no .
don't let them .
think of how much it'll mean to east compton .
they deserve to go .
do the right thing , dad !
did that just happen?
yeah .
where we come from , 'cheer 'is not a word we hear very often .
they should call us 'inspiration leaders 'instead .
oh , that's deep .
i like that .
i don't know why we writin 'to some talk show host .
it's like we beggin 'for charity .
it's not charity .
pauletta patton's from our neighborhood .
she'll understand why we need the money .
tell her we need to buy donuts .
her big butt will understand that .
ha ha !
stop being counterproductive , all right?
lava , please ... stop teaching her these big words before she choke on one .
no , better i choke you , lafred .
look, jenelope  you guys , stop !
please .
damn !
well , tell her about the late night practices we been having .
there you go .
that's the kind ofstuff she wants to hear about .
now we're talkin '.
you guys have to go to nationals .
did you come up here just to tell me that?
here .
i got my dad's company to sponsoryou guys .
what is this , hush money?
no .
oh , right .
it'sguilt money .
you pay our way in and you sleep better at night ... knowing how your whole world is based on one big , old fat lie .
well , you know what?
we don't need you .
why do you have to be so mean?
i'm just trying to do the right thing here .
i'm trying to be strong for my squad , okay?
that's what a captain does .
well , i'm a captain too , you know , and i'm trying to make it right .
you wanna make it right?
then when you go to nationals , bring it .
don't slack off because you feel sorry for us .
that way , when we beat you , we'll know it's because we're better .
i'll bring it .
don't worry .
i never do .
yeah , your parents just have to sign it .
i didn't do anything !
bye .
bye , tor .
i listened to your tape .
i loved it .
great .
can i talk to you?
i was upset that night .
aaron gave me a ride home .
it wasjust a good night kiss .
it meant nothing .
oh .
i'm sorry .
and i wanted you to know that ...
i broke up with him .
congratulations .
he didn't believe in me .
you did !
whatever .
that's important to me !
you believed in me !

torrance likes you .
okay?
she likes you .
she has an odd way ofshowing it .
don't be stupid .
she broke up with her boyfriend foryou .
yeah .

today's lettercomes from east compton , california .
where we come from ...
cheer is not a word that you hear very often ,
but that's what we are , the cheerleaders of east compton high school .
they should really call us inspiration leaders , because that's what we do .
we inspire the people from our neighborhoods ...
to believe that our team can win .
that's why we're askingyou to fulfill our wish ... to send us to the national cheerleading competition for the fi rst time .
well , clovers , you got your wish .
