in this book i collected all the prophecies of eibon , handed down from generation to generation over more then 4, 000 years .
you ungodly warlock .
because of you this hotel and this town will be cursed forever .
the seven dreaded gateways are concealed in 7 cursed places .
woe be unto him who ventures near without knowledge .
be careful what you do because this hotel was built on one of the 7 doors of evil and only i could save you .
woe be unto him who opens one of the 7 gateways to hell , because through that gateway evil will invade the world .
i told you martin , we can't .
all i inherited was the hotel , nothing else .
but it'd be such a pity not to .
let me at least finish the plans .
no forget it .
i won't even charge you for it .
look , really it's not the case .
ljust wanted to clean up the outside walls a bit , and maybe tidy up inside a bit and then , well , business starts booming we'll see .
it's better we do it now because wait four months or six and believe me , you are going to lay out .
you can't imagine the effect that double digit inflation is having on housing .
hi larry .
how's it going?
oh , good morning .
i'm gonna have this whole wall finished by tonight .
great .
bye .
outside is ok .
good old 1800th louisiana , but the interior .
i mean , hotels just aren't ...
the eyes !
the eyes !
the eyes !
eyes !
arthur .
where's that doctor?
he's on his way .
this man needs to get to a hospital .
i'll clean up the wounds first .
have you got any water?
i'm sorry , but till the plumber comes back i'm afraid i can't get you any .
then we'd better move him right now .
give me a hand , will you?
take the legs ... gently ... ok , up , right .
thank you doctor .
it's ok .
how can i check up on him?
ask me at the hospital .
john mckay .
we're off to a great start .
let's just hope there isn't any lasting damage .
i sure would like to know how a man can fall off a scaffolding 6 feet wide .
liza .
hey , look at this picture .
weird .
i wasn't aware that you had already scored a client .
client?
there isn't a soul here !
i guess it must have been arthur .
yeah .
hey , is anybody home?
just a minute , i'm coming !
good morning .
are you the plumber?
joe , right?
yes ma'm .
what's the trouble?
no , thank you .
i'm afraid i can't tell you .
nothing comes out of the faucets , and yet somehow the basement is flooded .
you tell me .
the whole basement?
and how !
well , let's take a look .
ok !
follow me , this way .
off we go .
i hope it isn't too serious .
watch out , the stairs are really slippery .
i'm an old sewer rat .
well , here it is .
how long do you think it will take?
it'll take as long as it takes !
martha?
i made this little pathway to the far end just forjoe .
thank you martha .
well , i'll go take that look .
where is arthur?
he is upstairs , tidying up , we're doing our best to help yeah , i know .
thank you .
listen , i'll be going into town later .
would you please make me out a list of all the things we'll need?
ok , don't worry .
arthur !
what are you doing in my room?
i was looking for keys .
which keys?
i told ma i was gonna clean up the rooms but some of them are locked .
well , ljust have to find those keys , arthur , won't i?
or else we'll simply call a locksmith .
in the meantime , could you go up on the roof and check the chimney?
i think it is clogged .
i heard a car drive up before .
was it joe?
yeah .
why??
you are liza , aren't you?
yes .
my name is emily .
i've been looking foryou .
joe !
joe !
joe !
arthur?
arthur?
i don't understand , emily .
how do you ... don't worry .
i know the way by heart .
and there's always dickey here .
come liza .
i'll show you the way .
joe?
emily .
why did you say i must give up the hotel?
i can't explain it to you .
just take my word for it .
go back to where you came from and hurry .
what's the matter?
i don't know .
he is in amazingly good condition for a corpse who is supposed to have been dead for 6 years .
well , the d . a .
said to open him up and see what he had for breakfast .
how about we give it a try with ... forget it .
you wanna wire this old guy into your brain wave machine?
why not?
okay .
okay .
but you're on your own with this one .
i warn you though .
when i get back , i'm gonna give him an autopsy .
harris here .
miller want you up at 24 on the double .
i'm on my way honey .
wait here for me jill .
i won't be long .
mommy !
mommy !
so , what did you do in the big apple?
just about everything a girl could do without losing her good english breeding and reputation , modeling , dancing , secretary .
i almost became an unsuccessful fashion designer .
when this letter arrived announcing the inheritance .
big surprise , uh?
more or less .
i mean , i knew i had a rich uncle who was a bachelor with a lot of real estate imagined for one day to the next but i neverthat i'd be running a hotel .
tell me , with all those accidents , you know , joe the plumber and the house painter .
do you think you'll give up now?
i couldn't do that if i wanted to .
this is my last chance .
either i run this hotel or i go on relief .
well i tell you what , when you get the hotel fixed up , i'll come and stay there so you can book me a room now .
sure , you've got it .
the best in the house .
of course .
how long do you think it'll be before it's ready?
i don't know , it's driving on so much .
arthur and martha are more of a hindrance then a help .
they just can't seem to get it together .
well , if you hired them , you can fire them .
but , i can't fire them .
they came with the hotel .
strange , i've never heard of them .
dr. mckay , dr .
mckay , you're wanted on the phone .
it's the hospital .
thank you .
excuse me .
oh ... harris , hi .
what?
... in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us ourtrespasses , as we forgive those who trespass against us .
lead us not to temptation , but deliver us from evil .
amen . ... and as we commit the souls of joe and mary ann , to ourfather in heaven we pray together , oh merciful father , watch overjill , their daughter whom joe and mary ann's untimely departure has left alone in this world , as a helpless child confort her , and guide her , and give her strenght we ask this , o lord , in the name of the father and of the son , and of the holy ghost .
amen .
courage , my child
liza !
liza !
liza !
emily?
why didn't you listen to me liza?
we blind see things more clearly .
i wanted to spare you , but now i'll have to tell you everything .
60 years ago everybody in this hotel disappeared .
every last person .
a painter called schweik , who lived here closeted in his room had found a key .
what key?
the seven gateways to hell .
this house was constructed on one of the ... who else is here?
there's nobody here .
i can feel a presence .
somebody else is in here .
no , emily .
nobody is here .
yes , it's him .
he is here again .
he has come back to the hotel .
get ahold of yourself , emily , please .
what is this?
that?
a painting , just an old painting .
there's the bell .
that's the bell from room 36 .
that's where he was killed , in his room !
36 was schweik's room , the man who found the key .
he has returned , liza .
don't ever enterthat room .
now look emily , i've lived in ny all my life and if there is one thing i've learned not to believe in it's ghosts .
i was lucky to inherit this hotel .
the first good break i've had .
it'll take more than a faulty electrical contact or some crazy story to make me give it up .
emily !
emily !
emily !
liza !
john !
hey , hey , calm down , calm down .
take it easy , take it easy , come on .
but i saw him .
there , nailed to the wall .
he ... see these nails .
well , they certainly look old , but this seems more like rust than blood .
now it seems so impossible , so absurd .
and yet ... i don't know .
now look , come and tell me exactly what you saw , hmm?
no , never mind .
it's useless .
i guess i must have a pretty wild imagination .
hmm?
i got carried away with that story that emily told me about room 36 .
emily?
who's emily?
the blind girl that lives in the old house by the crossroads .
there's no blind girl living there .
and i know everyone around here .
the book !
the what?
the book that was on the desk .
it's gone !
open two walls and enterthe basement and then you'll have a room for a kitchen and maybe for a laundry .
huh?
what do you think of that?
martin , i've already told you .
i don't have the money .
do whateveryou want to as long as it doesn't cost .
i have carte blanche?
carte blanche , but not a blank check .
okay?
okay .
well , the first thing we do is bring someone in to pump out all the water .
that i can get done real cheap .
and then ... oh , and on the other side i'll make a living room and a game room .
have you got the original plans of the cellar by any chance?
there was another book here .
a different one .
you wanna buy the book no , not this one .
the one that was here before , just a second ago .
that book has been there fortwo years .
nobody wants to buy it .
it's very nice though .
very , very interesting .
liza !
what's wrong?
about the book?
i was just looking for ... what?
is anything the matter?
you look sick .
you're sure it's nothing?
i'm just a little tired that's all .
i think i'm beginning to see things .
i get the picture .
later i'll have to go to the town hall and dig out the originals from the files .
re open that hotel?
uh , huh .
anyway , all the turn of the century building plans are on those upper shelves there .
they should be under what the cards say , m 13, 012 .
well , let's get them down and look at them .

the cuts on my ... there are no !
i must be going crazy .
perhaps , or else ... who are you liza?
who are you really?
john , i don't understand you .
what a question .
