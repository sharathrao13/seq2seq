hey , guys .
l got a surprise for you .
which one of you can tell me who that is?
ginuwine .
so which one of you wants to audition for his video?
what video?
open calls are in two weeks , and i'll rehearse with anybody who's up to it .
so which one of you wants to audition for ginuwine's video?
all right .
can i help you?
you're the dance teacher , right?
i'm otis's brother .
you're the one his little man's been hanging out with , right?
you mean benny?
yeah , benny .
we ain't seen benny around in a while and we miss him .
he's been busy .
check this out .
he's part of my crew .
and when you're in my crew , you don't mess with other shit .
so you tell him i'm looking for him .
i'm not gonna do that .
what?
why not?
i asked you a question !
yo , honey .
hey .
b. b. , what's poppin '?
am i interrupting?
well , if it ain't floyd the barber .
how are things in that cute little barbershop of yours , b.?
you making ends meet?
oh , you know .
i'm definitely doing me .
getting this paper .
getting this paper .
check this out .
when you're tired of nickel and diming, just give me a holler .
i'm gonna hook you up .
well , you ever get tired of wearin 'those bum ass do rags , you give me a holler .
i'll hook you up .
i wanna see that kid .
you okay?
yeah , i'm cool .
what was that all about?
how did you get on b. b. 's bad side?
i made the wrong friend , i guess .
well , you know , you should stay away from him .
he's dangerous .
seriously .
yeah .
thinking of picking up some pepper spray tomorrow or something .
did i say thank you?
you sure you don't want me to walk you upstairs and make sure you're safe?
no .
i can handle myself .
thanks again .
uh
bye .
come on .
mom , what happened?
another pipe burst .
you can't be in here .
how long will it take to fix?
oh , who knows?
building codes , inspections .
now the city wants to do a full assessment , see if the building's even worth reopening .
ma , you can't let them shut you down .
honey , your telling me what i can and cannot do is not gonna improve my mood right now .
i don't know what to do about this .
lf there's a danger to the kids
he's one of those kids , you know , trying to act all bad .
but 10 seconds into a routine , i catch a glimpse of him .
it's like i can just see this light shining out of him .
he's a kid again .
yeah .
it's the best feeling i know seeing that .
it's scary though .
'cause when i think of him hanging out with b. b. , it's like i can watch that light get dimmer and dimmer .
well , you know , when a thug joint's the hottest spot in the hood , it's hard for a kid not to want to be down .
i know .
i'm over here .
nah , nah , nah .
i wanna show you something .
all right .
all right , sexy?
stop with that .
you know , most of the kids l came up with werejust like that .
trying to be thugged out , and wanting to fit in .
'cause that's what everybody else was doing .
where are they now, jail?
most of them , or headed that way like b. b. , or dead .
listen , this is bad date talk .
we should change the subject .
what's your favorite color?
how come you turned out so good?
she thinks i turned out good .
i'm serious .
i don't know .
i got lucky .
what happened?
well , the guy that used to own this shop lived right next door to me and my mom .
and when he saw me get into some bad things , he gave me a job here sweeping up the floors .
it's crazy 'cause he couldn't even afford it .
he paid me right out of his own pocket .
i worked for him for 1 0 years .
and when he passed , he left this place to me .
see , b. b. likes to talk shit like i'm the one that's losing ,
like i'm missing something out there on the streets , but he and i both know who's winning .
i've found something that i truly love , that truly makes me happy .
and that's a million times better than finding something that makes you rich .
so , it's just someone believing in you .
well , that and having a place to go where i could stay out of trouble , yeah .
what?
nothing . just thinking .
about what?
about what makes me happy .
well , you know , i would really love to be a part of that .
what?
making you happy .
477 castle hill avenue ... will go for about $170, 000 .
so 17 down?
seventeen thousand down , yes . ln cash .
how about i give you half the down payment now , and you give me 30 days to come up with the rest?
lf i don't , you put it back on the market .
why do you even want this property?
it's just an empty storefront on a bad block .
it's perfect for a dance studio .
maybe even a dance school for the whole neighborhood .
so am i writing a check or not?
by all means .
five , six , seven , eight .
cut .
you have no idea what this means to them .
oh , sure , i do .
i had a first job too once .

i thought we were going to a meeting .
business and pleasure are the same thing .
you know that , honey .
lf i knew it was a party , i wouldn't have canceled on my best friend's birthday .
you would rather go to atlantic city , which will always be there , with friends you always see , instead of going to the hottest party in town with me?
look .
everybody is gonna be there .
all right?
artists , producers , other choreographers .
it would be career suicide if you didn't go .

nah , it's not it's not working .
which part?
the whole part .
the whole kid thing .
it's horrible .
no , michael .
don't do this .
i was thinking i wanted to make it a little more sexy , you know .
a little more real .
what's more real than these kids?
oh , no .
michael , don't do this .
lf you want to get back at me , do that , but don't take it out on these kids .
katrina , baby .
hey .
all right , now i'm gonna give you some music .
okay .
and i want you to listen and then move .
got you .
go do your thing .
do not take away the one thing they have to be excited about .
look .
i have a lot to do today , all right?
so if you want to get paid , pack up your shit and take your little friends out of here .
i want you to fire 'em .
i want you to tell them why you're not using 'em .
what's going on?
don't worry about it .
what makes you think i care what you want?
yeah , the label called .
they're not into the kid thing at all .
for real?
aw , man .
all right .
i'm so sorry .
so it's not gonna happen?
no .
he changed his mind about what he wants .
why?
just because .
you made him mad , didn't you?
not intentionally .
look, you guys .
there will be other opportunities .
no , there won't .
let's go , y'all .
this is wack .
oh , you're funny , right?
okay .
what happened to your big dance career?
it's weak , man .
thug life , baby .
yo .
that's what it is .
i like those .
yo .
go cop those for me , man .
let's move .
come on , go .
come on , ladies .
let me see it .
five , six , seven , eight .
turn .
front .
back .
lf that's the girl we heard about , then no way .
i can't get a job anywhere .
michael's blackballing me .
you sure about that?
yeah , and all he has to do is mention he doesn't want me working .
what kind of clown would do that , stop somebody from earning a living?
i guess he figures since he gave me my career , he can take it away .
hey .
he didn't give you anything .
you get hired because you've got drive , talent and love for what you do .
that's a gift from god , not some video director .
the thing is , i was counting on that money .
not for me , for the kids .
that studio could be unbelievable .
it could change their life .
hmm , paying off that balance?
actually , i came for an extension .
i need more time .
how much?
i don't know .
i sort of hit a financial snag .
miss daniels , if i could help you , i would .
but i've already agreed to keep this property off the market for two full weeks for you .
that's the best i can do .
i know it's a lot of money .
i'm sorry , honey .
we just don't have it .
and even if we did evelyn , don't .
even if you did what , ma?
honey , a commitment like that , you take that on , you are gonna be stuck here forever .
you'll never leave .
oh , i forgot .
i'm supposed to see all the beautiful things in this world .
well , there's nothing wrong with my wanting that for you .
no , but what about what i want?
you're 22 years old .
you don't know what you want .
you know what i see living in this neighborhood?
i see kids go from bad homes to bad schools and back again .
and i've seen you unlock a door to a place where those kids can feel safe .
maybe i'm dumb because i haven't been to paris or milan or wherever , but to me , it doesn't get much better than that .
lt was everything i always wanted .
but when i had got it , it felt like nothing , less than nothing .
and now losing it feels even worse .
i'm not looking for sympathy .
i just need someone to talk to , someone i know and trust .
i'm so sorry , gina .
i totally let you down .
do you think you could ever trust me again?
i don't know .
maybe .
you're my girl .
you know the first thing i thought when i saw that picture in the paper?
that hood rat lied to me .
no , that was the second .
that hood rat skipped out on my birthday .
no , that was the third .
what was the first?
that hood rat went to the black and white party and she did not bring me .
l know you're in a jam right now , but , honey, you got skills .
and that's gonna take you places .
i just thought that , you know , being your girl and all , i'd get to go too .
you can .
no , i can't .
i'm just your friend .
you're the one with the goods .
you're the one that people want .
you don't need me .
you just need to trust and believe in yourself .
like i do .
come here .
don't worry , baby , you'll find work real soon .
you're too good not to get hired .
all right?
i just don't have the time to wait for people to wake up to that .
i'm gonna lose the building at the end of the month .
lf i can't earn it , and i can't borrow it , and i can't steal it ,
i could raise it .
what do you mean?
well , i'm trying to get a space for kids , right?
lf people knew about it , they'd want to help , wouldn't they?
yeah , probably .
i could put on a benefit performance .
charge a cover .
get some donated food .
put on a great show .
i could do that .
why couldn't i do that?
'cause i don't have a space , that's why .
damn it !
come here , mami .
i got an idea .
that's love .
nah , baby , i got you on my christmas list .
all right?
one , one .
it's just off the b. q. e. it used to be a church .
the cat i was just on the phone with , he used to own it .
but in three weeks they're converting it to office space , so it's empty now .
lf you want it , you better jump on it .
what's it like?
it's dirty .
it's old .
but it has a floor , right?
yeah .
i'll take it .
thank you .
hey , guys .
hi , honey .
what's up?
i know what you're thinking , " what the hell we doing here?
don't worry , it's temporary .
this is what we call a means to an end .
nobody's gonna give us a space , that much is clear .
so we're gonna raise the money and buy it , straight up and legal .
y'all ever heard of a benefit performance?
what do you mean?
likejerry lewis?
sort of .
i'm jerry .
you're the kids .
let's get to work .

good color for you .
l spoke to your moms .
she said you're getting out tomorrow .
that's right .
when you do , i want you to come hang with me .
nah .
you could have a good life , benny .
it doesn't have to be like this .
what do you know?
you ain't got no job .
you ain't got no money .
matter of fact , you ain't got nothing .
what i got is a clear conscience .
yeah?
what you gonna buy with that?
it breaks my heart seeing you selling yourself short like this .
so leave .
get .
let me ask you something .
you know your homies , those guys that got your back?
yeah?
how many times they come to visit you?
you think about that .
i don't know if this is gonna work , missy .
but , uh , nah , katrina's gonna make this so sexy , it's not gonna matter .
katrina?
who the hell is katrina?
that's katrina .
