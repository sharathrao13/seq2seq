no hiding the bone behind a napkin .
today we'll start with the entree .
let's begin .

she bites , she kicks , she throws food ... what is that?
so , you got it?
six months .
and i want immediate results or she gets a bullet in the brain .
turn it off .
ask me why i'm so serious .
why are you so serious?
because i've got serious stuff to tell you , maggie for margaret .

happy birthday .
okay , now the bad stuff .
kaufman has drawn a llne in the sand .
he says he's not gonna take any more crap from you .
he mentioned the word " bullet " and the word " brain .
you hearing me?
is this going in , maggie?
because i want you to know , it's now out of my hands .
happy birthday .
will you help me?
of course .
come upstairs .
all you need is balance .
we have to find your feminine strength .
some moon to go with your sun .
a bit of the poet to balance the warrior .
don't you want to carry your jacket?
surely not just for a dinner iesson .

kansas city .
she was born in kansas city but raised in chicago .
i used to see her during the summers on my uncle's farm .
you didn't know she spent summers on a farm , did you?
well , she did .
i remember one summer ... ... the iocal kids ... ... the kids 'family owned this mare .
she was ... ... black as a raven's wing , completely wild .
remember?
they called her beauty .
she was trained as a trotter , but she had never really been ridden .
anyway ....
the kids told claudia that she had to ride beauty ... ... that it was like an initiation , the kind of thing they all had to do .
anyway , one day , i remember ... ... about noon ... ... it was really , really hot .
we heard this scream .
we ran outside .
there was claudia .
claudia ... ... bareback on this wild horse .
the horse went completely crazy .
bucked , reared .
she hung on .
she just gritted her teeth , dug her heels in ... ... and she hung on .
and , by god , she rode that horse .
i guess that's how i remember her really .
this silp of a giri on a wild black horse .
she was so beautiful .
she was so beautifui that she gleamed .
do you know what i mean?
that's really you .
that's what i thought you'd be like .
by the way ... ... did claudia tell you what i do?
i'm in the travei business .
i'm a partner in a travei agency and ...
