extreme close up !
ok .
all right .
all right .
here we are in our new surroundings , the abandoned acme doll factory in downtown aurora , illinois .
an official babe lair .
it'll be chick central .
i feel sorry for guys who still live with their parents .
ok .
you've probably noticed we're on early tonight .
usually , at this time on aurora cable , you're watching plant world .
they didn't want our 10 : 30 time slot .
but we were able to talk plant world into changing with cooking world .
although they didn't want to change .
fortunately , white supremacy world was cancelled and the trades worked .
finally , the reason we're on early is because we're going to a concert tonight in chicago .
excellent .
yes .
did i mention that we'll be seeing aerosmith?
until next week , good night and party on .
party on , wayne !
party on , garth .
and we're out .
all right !
let's move , people !
all right .
garth !
to the mirthmobile .
the mirthmobile !
all right !
hi .
i'm wayne campbell .
excellent .
welcome to wayne's world 2 .
let me bring you up to speed .
come on .
there's a lot to tell you , so let's take the scenic route .
a year has passed .
i'm a little older and a little wiser .
i'm starting to get hair in really weird places .
i feel like i'm turning into sasquatch .
i still go out with my girlfriend cassandra .
she's cutting a record demo right now .
her career's really taking off .
you remember cassandra , don't you?
what a babe !
she'd give a dog a bone !
but you know , even though i live on my own now , everybody's really hassling me to do something with my life .
to become an adult .
i feel like i'm in a john hughes " rites de passage " movie .
but what i'd really like to do is something extraordinary .
something big , something mega , copious , capacious , cajunga .
but i'll probably end up working at great america , mopping up hurl and lung butter .
you remember my best friend garth algar , right?
i almost forgot .
this year , garth finally got pubes .
you didn't tell them about my pubes , did you?
no , of course not .
you are listening to wplg , the pig .
all rock , all the time .
wplg aurora .
handsome dan coming at you on the short side of nine bells at wplg ,
america's rock authority .
what do you say we check in with mr scream?
god , handsome dan is so cool .
he must get a million chicks .
i bet he's totally studly and buffed .
with that voice , he's gotta be a babe magnet .
welcome to mikita's .
how may i serve you?
i'd like 'rullers , 'ugar , 'ucks and a mikita 'cup ...
and then i think i would like a large ... ... with 'eam .
and could i please have 'elly donut and ... ... raspberry and a 'nge drink?
what?
i'm sorry .
and 'eaker 'oken .
let me recap the order .
a cruller , two sugar pucks , a large coffee with cream , a raspberry jelly doughnut , orange drink , a box of five holes .
yeah .
thank you .
drive around , please .
i'm so psyched .
aerosmith's gonna kick ass !
but where are we supposed to meet cassandra?
backstage laminates .
encore !
encore !
let's go !
garth !
somebody just grabbed my butt !
all right !
i feel weird .
it's like a thousand fingers urging you to let go .
i'm having fun .
excellent !
you guys wail !
you guys rule , man !
lunch is here !
dude looks like a lady ...
so do you !
all right !
coming by !
excuse me !
where is the backstage area?
excuse us .
excuse me .
they're cool .
there she is .
cassandra !
campbell !
campbell !
there she is .
sorry we couldn't sit together .
no troubles .
great concert !
i want you to meet somebody .
this is bobby cahn of sharp records .
excellent .
good to see you .
bobby's my record producer .
we must drop by the studio .
i don't have to tell you how extremely talented cassandra is .
you've heard , you've seen , you know .
scott .
i want you to meet someone .
cassandra , this is scott .
hi .
and dwayne .
actually , wayne .
right .
bobby says you're very talented .
i was saying the same thing .
i want to ask you something .
don't you hate schmoozing?
yes .
i just despise it .
stand back , please !
we're not worthy !
we're not worthy !
you're worthy .
get up .
you guys were excellent tonight .
thanks a lot .
we'll see you inside .
we're planning on it .
excellent .
gotcha .
great .
hold on .
excuse me .
jeez .
wayne , look .
garth , it's heather locklear .
and she's signalling to us !
there is a god .
heather be thy name .
schwing !
bobby !
heather !
are you coming?
yeah , we're ...
this is cassandra .
hello .
we're supposed to be in there .
no , you're not .
my girlfriend's in there .
a lot of people's girlfriends are in there .
denied .
hi !
where are you from?
i'm from wilmette .
i'm from cicero .
isn't it cool to be downtown?
are you those guys with that tv show in aurora?
wayne's world?
wayne's world !
no !
you guys sure look like 'em .
if wayne says we're not , we're not , ok?
how long does it take to get here from aurora?
it takes me 40 minutes door to door .
my ma gave me a dollar and dropped me off at the park and ride .
dogs .
dogs .
... and marilyn .
marilyn .
i saw the creature .
i saw the creature ...
who are you?
i'm jim morrison .
cool .
who's he?
a weird naked indian .
cool .
why have you brought me here?
to help you find some answers , wayne .
answers to what?
ask me a question .
two trains travelling at 60mph , one from chicago , one from los angeles ...
no .
ask me a question about your life .
what am i supposed to do with my life?
you should put on a concert in aurora , wayne .
how will i get the bands to come?
if you book them , they will come .
but i don't know how to put on a concert .
you must go to england and find a man named del preston , the greatest roadie that ever lived .
he was with us in the good times and the bad .
he'll help you .
any more questions?
will garth ever get his sports illustrated football phone?
it was sent to the wrong house .
it will arrive tomorrow with the swimsuit issue and the video ,
the stanley cup 100 years of glory .
how do i get back?
follow the weird naked indian .
cool .
wake up , wayne !
garth !
i just had the most vivid and powerful dream of my life .
last night , jim morrison spoke to me .
he told me that the purpose of my life was to put on a concert .
guess what finally came in the mail?
i guess they sent it to the wrong house .
my sports illustrated football phone ...
oh , my god !
cool .
my sports illustrated swimsuit issue ...
oh , my god . ... and the history of the stanley cup 100 years of glory .
garth , it's a sign !
we will put on a concert .
oh , yes .
we will put on a concert .
this must be the place .
maybe we should've called cassandra before we dropped by .
garth , it's us .
no one'll hassle us .
cassandra needs the encouragement .
excuse me , what are you guys doing here in the street?
i'm stacking these chickens in the crates .
jim makes sure we have plenty of watermelons .
so you're selling watermelons?
no , we just make sure there's plenty stacked .
just like the chickens .
what do they do?
they walk past with this glass .
that's ... weird .
you got to wonder if this is gonna pay off later on .
cool .
it's ok .
we ought to overdub a track with bobby .
he can wail .
give them a few minutes .
they're working on it .
the label figures you got three singles on this one .
they want you to come to the coast .
excellent .
not bad for a little girl from hong kong .
what brings you here , wayne?
i had to tell cassandra something .
yeah?
yeah .
last night i had a dream .
we're gonna put on a concert in aurora .
that's a great idea .
yeah .
it's a festival .
a festival?
a festival .
you heard the man .
charming .
what's it called?
what's it called?
it's called ...
it's called ...
it's called waynestock .
waynestock .
who's going to be there?
aerosmith and pearl jam .
who else?
me and wayne .
and ...
and ...
van halen .
van halen .
who else?
yeah .
who else?
an old man fashioning a kayak out of a log ...?
what?
no !
rip taylor !
rip taylor's gonna be there .
rip taylor?
he's a god in my country .
he gets mobbed in the street .
great , 'cause he's gonna be there .
i thought maybe you could play , too .
i would be honoured .
i wouldn't commit just yet .
you got some real gigs coming up .
real gigs !
real gigs?
lx nay on the condescension ay there , chet .
bobby , can i ask you a question?
what is it , garth?
a sphincter says what?
i said , a sphincter says what?
you want me to say " what " , like i don't get it .
is that it?
is that it?
oh , dear .
last guy didn't get .
you big .
you big .
we small .
we better go .
where are you going?
england !
i can't believe paramount is paying to fly us to england .
i thought they'd use doubles .
here we are at piccadilly circus .
what a shitty circus .
good call .
there's no animals or clowns .
what a rip off .
let's go to buckingham palace .
does princess di still live here?
she is such a babe .
did jim morrison give you del preston's exact address?
he said exactly london , england .
ok .
i don't know about this , wayne .
del?
hello?
are you del preston?
i might be .
who are you?
my name's wayne campbell .
i'm garth algar .
that's terribly fascinating , man , but you woke me up .
how can you sleep like that?
listen , sonny jim , sleeping like this will add 10 years to your life .
i learned it from keith richards when i toured with the stones .
that may be why keith cannot be killed by conventional weapons .
how can i be of assistance?
you're gonna think i'm nuts , but ... ... someone visited me in a dream and told me that del preston would help me put on a concert in aurora , illinois .
a concert?
i'm afraid you've been misinformed .
i don't do that any more .
i'm just an old geezer .
what do i know about music today?
when i was working , it was all bands like eric clapton and the rolling stones .
it's not like the grateful dead are still touring , is it?
actually ...
garth .
look at this scrapbook .
that's you with led zeppelin .
yeah .
my old lady put that together .
we must've toured every concert hall and venue in america , me , my old lady and the road .
is that you and bob dylan?
yeah .
who's the old lady?
that's my old lady .
it was fun , but those days are gone forever .
but we came from america just to talk to you .
i'm sorry .
i don't do concerts any more .
come on .
let's go .
well , i still think you led a really cool life .
it was nice meeting you .
i guess jim was wrong .
hang about .
was it jim morrison?
yes !
did he have a naked indian?
yes !
i have to ask you ...
didn't you think it was a trifle unnecessary to see the crack in the indian's bottom?
yes !
absolutely !
i had the same dream .
del , you'll really love aurora .
who's aurora , anyway?
frank , this is bobby .
did you get the tape?
what'd you think?
definitely .
she sounds great .
yeah , the band is terrible .
it's a garage band .
they can't , i'm sure .
i'm working with them .
i'm still in this studio in aurora .
what the hell you doing there?
she wants to stay here .
why?
same reason they all want to stay , she's got a boyfriend .
don't worry .
i'll get rid of the boyfriend and the band .
i'd like to finish the album in ia .
all right , bobby .
let's just get it done , ok?
and there i am in sri lanka , formerly ceylon , at 3am ,
looking for 1, 000 brown m& ms to fill a brandy glass , or ozzy wouldn't go on stage that night .
jeff beck pops his head round the door and mentions there's a little sweet shop on the edge of town .
we go , and it's closed .
there's me and keith moon and david crosby breaking into this little sweet shop , right?
instead of a guard dog , they've got this bloody great big bengal tiger .
i managed to take out the tiger with a can of mace , but the shop owner and his son , that's a different story altogether .
i had to beat them to death with their own shoes .
nasty business , really , but sure enough , i got the m& ms , and ozzy went on stage and did a great show .
that was excellent .
to put on a really great rock show ,
like knebworth in england or woodstock , there is only one place you can do it , and that's here , at adlai stevenson memorial park , in the playing fields .
we better go check it out .
so , wayne ...?
i hear you're putting on some kind of concert .
that's good .
people need to be entertained , need the distraction .
i wish somebody'd do something to block out the voices in my head , the voices that scream over and over ,
why do they come to me to die?
why do they come to me to die?
what do we do now?
here .
let me look at it .
get the flashlight .
ok .
there's the main gate , and here we are .
no , we're over here .
i don't think so .
we turned left at the gate , so that would put us ...
garth !
wait a minute .
i know where we are .
i'm pretty good with maps .
listen .
what?
turn it off !
i can't turn it off !
i can't turn it off !
waynestock?
you'd purposely invite rock 'n 'roll into our community?
what's wrong with a little entertainment?
entertainment is fine , but this ...
we have lots of big acts that come through here .
ice capades , tiny toons , kenny g ...
kenny g?
we don't even get to apply for a permit?
we would love to put on a rock concert ... not !
betty jo , could we have the permits for a festival , please?
thank you .
you must fill out the necessary permit applications .
permit applications .
here you go .
thank you , betty jo .
hey , you're the guy that's on that wayne world show .
betty jo?
yeah?
thank you .
all right .
naturally , you'll need the application for authorisation , approval from the guilds and unions , you'll need some release forms , the decibel level ...
what?
is something wrong?
what do you mean?
it's my eye , isn't it?
why would we want to look at your eye?
is there something wrong with that weird eye?
there's nothing wrong with my eye .
this one just has no pigment .
i'm what you call a partial ocular albino , but i'm fine with it .
i have perfect 20 20 vision with both eyes .
you're serious about putting on a rock concert?
are you kidding?
i'd give my right eye .
you realise there are certain jurisdictions you'll need to follow .
i'd like to think i have an eye for details .
i'm assuming you have the $5, 000 occupancy permit ... ... or you wouldn't be here .
exsqueeze me?
baking powder? $5, 000 occupancy permit?
yes , we have that , actually .
piece of cake .
fine .
then all applications must be filled out in triplicate and returned at least 10 working days before the event , with the money .
we'll run through these with a fine toothed comb , cross the ts and dot the ...
... lower case js .
i keep falling over .
oh , no .
i'm falling over a lot .
damn these high heels .
cassandra ...?
why do you go out with me?
i love being with you .
most guys are jerks .
you're a good person .
wait .
let me show you what i got at a garage sale .
isn't that great?
heard of it?
exsqueeze me?
have i ever seen this before?
everybody has frampton comes alive .
if you lived in the suburbs , you were issued it .
it came in the mail with samples of tide .
look at this old one .
gerry and the pacemakers .
that is old .
i bet those guys actually have pacemakers by now .
can you believe they don't make vinyl anymore?
it's weird , isn't it?
that is weird .
bobby said my album won't be vinyl .
bobby says ...
are you and bobby having an affair?
no , of course not .
where did you hear that?
you know how these things start ... one guy tells another guy something , then he tells two friends , and they tell two friends , and they tell their friends , and so on , and so on ...
you know how it goes .
honestly , i'm not having an affair .
i'm nice to him because he's my producer .
if this deal falls through , i lose my visa and i go back to hong kong .
you have nothing to worry about .
my dad's coming to visit .
i'd love you to meet him .
treat .
i'm sure he'll just love me .
yeah .
if you're anything like my old boyfriend .
i'm nothing like him .
then we're screwed .
i haven't seen garth in a while .
what's he up to?
garth's doing his laundry .
too bad he doesn't have a girlfriend to do his laundry .
yeah .
thanks for doing my laundry .
how do you get my clothes so white and fresh smelling?
it's an old cantonese method few people know about .
wait a minute .
calgon?
ancient chinese secret?
hello .
hi .
i don't recall ever seeing you in here .
it's my first time in here .
that's right .
my mom used to do all my laundry , but i do now .
i'm what you call " sans parents " .
i can go to a movie on a school night , like that .
welcome to the neighbourhood .
would you like some red rope liquorice?
sure .
what's your name?
garth algar .
what's yours?
i'm honey ...
horne .
nice to meet you , miss horny .
that's horne .
it's french .
ok , miss horne .
garth , would you like to have dinner some night?
i like to have dinner every night .
no , i mean us .
you and me .
would you like to have dinner?
a date?
finally .
it took , like , two hours .
i like 'em teeny and toasty .
so long .
bye .
bye .
maybe we'll see each other around .
yeah .
see you around .
you forgot these .
good night , cassandra .
good work .
thanks .
see you tomorrow .
good night .
i have got to get you to ia .
you are buried here .
i like it here .
all my friends are here .
what time is it?
10 : 35 .
damn .
i missed the start of wayne's show .
ok .
we're in a doll factory , right?
it reminds me of that movie the leprechaun , with that little guy that goes , " i'm the leprechaun .
garth , i'm the leprechaun !
cool it , ok?
i'm the leprechaun !
stop it , all right?
don't try and steal me pot o 'gold .
why do you like these guys?
because they're fun .
if i wanted a guy that was all ambition ,
i could've stayed in hong kong .
those guys are 12 for 10 cents .
you mean a dime a dozen .
maybe where you shop .
i think you underestimate them .
they're really sharp .
stop it , leprechaun man !
garth , chill !
what did those monsters do to you?
i'm not ...
sweetie .
sweetie .
come on , sweetie .
come on .
pixie dust .
pixie dust .
sweetie , it's me ...
the leprechaun !
no !
i'm the leprechaun .
yeah .
these guys , really sharp .
i'm scared !
want to leave , but can't .
want to move .
where you gonna move?
you gonna move to ireland?
no !
'cause i'm a leprechaun ...
wayne , we're here !
here .
let me get the gate for you .
all righty .
come on in .
nice digs , huh?
cassandra , you look hot .
sorry .
i'd like you to meet my father , mr wong .
please meet you acquaintance , wayne campbell .
very well , if that is your custom .
prepare to die .
i know all seven animal styles the crane .
the stag .
the horse .
the tiger .
the bat .
the rat .
the monkey .
the beetle .
i will take you , old man .
your tongue is quick .
but your sword?
oh , no .
wayne !
hello?
can we talk later?
this is not a good time .
just a moment .
i've got call waiting .
hello .
yes?
can i call you back?
i am on the other line .
yes , he received a sports illustrated football phone .
wayne , no !
you've impressed me .
you're worthy of my daughter .
we got a party tomorrow at komrades .
it's kind of a fundraiser for waynestock .
right .
there'll be a $ 10 cover charge .
it'll be a big party .
because it's at komrades , we're calling it a communist party .
i remember one time i was in a place like this .
sri lanka .
formerly ceylon .
it was about three in the morning .
i was looking for 1, 000 brown m& ms to fill a brandy glass , or ozzy wouldn't go on stage that night .
jeff beck pops his head round the door and mentions there's a little sweet shop on the edge of town .
wayne !
garth !
milton !
how's it going?
awesome party !
good tunes , good brew , good buddies .
i feel great , man .
i feel great !
i don't know , man .
i hate my father .
i hate my life .
but i feel great .
you guys are great .
i'm gonna go pick a fight .
he's gotten a lot better .
way better .
yeah .
thank you .
i'll be back in a bit .
how's it going?
hi .
it's looking good , campbell .
i'll be at the bar .
good .
i'm so glad you made it .
you look amazing !
i see .
wait .
i have great news .
bobby's taking me to ia to do the final mix on my album .
isn't that terrific?
that's great .
i'm ecstatic .
i'm beside myself with joy .
hooray for hollywood .
living on your own has its perks .
your mom doesn't tell you to turn down the stereo .
that's a real drag .
because moms genetically hate music played at the appropriate level .
and my dad , forget it .
he'd ruin a led zeppelin reunion concert .
he hates music at the correct level .
but the shopkeeper and his son was a different story altogether .
i had to beat them to death with their own shoes .
what's the deal with bobby?
wayne?
it's getting a little out of hand .
i think you better say something .
good call .
everybody , i'd like to say something !
excuse me .
everybody , can i get your attention?
i'd like to say something .
keep it down .
we're really glad you could all make it .
we never knew we had so many friends who believed in this concert idea .
when we first had this idea of putting on this shindig , we didn't know if anyone would come .
but look ...
you're all here , pitching in .
i promised myself i wouldn't cry .
party on !
garth , i'm starting to get a bad feeling , man .
i think something's going on .
hello .
yes?
is this aerosmith's tour manager?
it is?
hello .
my name is wayne campbell .
you don't know me .
i'm not mental or anything .
i'm putting on a concert in aurora , illinois .
yes , i can hold .
del , look .
for years i thought this was a mercedes emblem .
woodstock?
that was quite a show , man .
you were at woodstock?
excellent .
what was it like?
it rained all morning and then it cleared up in the afternoon .
that's it .
i almost remembered something else , but it's gone .
you can't remember what it was?
still holding .
i want ...
wayne , look what i made .
good work , my friend .
you guys got the permit applications?
got the money?
good for you .
most people just take them and never come back .
position 1 to position 2 .
do you copy?
this is position 2 in position .
position 3 , what's your position?
position 3 .
i read you .
position 4 , do you copy?
over .
4 copies .
back to position 1 .
over .
i've to go to ia for a couple of days .
if you need anything ...
i'm at this number .
position 1 to position 2 .
did you see that?
this is position 2 in position !
sorry , man .
i didn't see anything .
what is it?
abort !
we have been identified !
abandon positions !
wayne , let's run away !
garth , it's locked !
in here !
the tool box
come on !
let's go !
do it , miss thing !
do it !
do it !
get it , girl !
get it , girl !
what's the matter?
you look like you want to say something to me .
i think we should break up .
what?
why?
because there comes a time when people should go their separate ways .
i mean , i've got waynestock , you've got your career and your producer , and i just think it's time that we should see other people .
i don't want to see other people .
what about bobby?
what about him?
come on !
do you think i'm a gullibull or even a gullicalf?
i've no idea what you're talking about .
right !
come on , now !
what about these?
where did these come from?
i did a little detective work .
you did spy on me .
yes , i did .
easy .
i think she took that well .
let's go .
ladies and gentlemen !
your roadie training begins today .
it will not be easy .
you will get tired .
you will get blisters .
you will get aches and pains .
but you will also get good .
are you ready?
yes , sir !
roadies present and accounted for , sir !
let's begin .
eye on the task !
come on .
let's go !
jesus !
it's crazy !
they're getting better , del .
look .
get that microphone !
you're worthless !
you're less than nothing !
what's keeping you here?
you don't belong here !
why don't you just quit?
'cause i got no place else to go !
thanks for coming in with me .
i'm always afraid to come in by myself .
come .
come on .
come on .
sit down .
and i'll fix us a little drink , ok?
there you are .
an old fashioned .
this coke's gone bad .
i just love a man with a sense of humour .
you know what i wish?
what?
i wish i could climb inside that big brain of yours and just walk around .
really?
you know what i love?
what?
i love the way those big , thick glasses magnify your pupils .
look at me .
i'll bet you like to be in control .
tell me .
when i was 17 , my little sister tried to borrow my def leppard record .
i said , " no way .
that's just what i'm talking about .
oh , my god .
you're so limber .
don't you just love music?

he's bobbing .
he's weaving .
he winds up !

are you all right?
women .
i feel like i'm in the delete bin of life , next to mahogany rush .
i'm sorry .
relationships aren't for the timid .
and i should know .
for i'm no longer a stranger in the ways of the woman .
all right , man , all right .
good work , my friend .
on that note , game on .
game on !
all right !
he's wheeling .
he's dealing .
he shoots !
he scores !
ok .
ladies and gentlemen , it takes two people to run a concert .
one backstage and one out front .
two .
one man alone cannot do this .
wayne , you will run the backstage team .
milton , you are the liaison between wayne's backstage team and garth's frontstage team , which includes myself in the booth .
to the left and the right of the stage are the machine gun nests , belt fed m 60 brownings .
these babies tend to heat up , so shoot in three second bursts .
in the event of capture ,
i will personally distribute cyanide capsules , to be placed under the tongue like so .
any questions?
yeah .
i have a question .
when did you turn into a nut bar?
thank you , mr scream .
i'm gonna be joined by wayne and garth , giving us the low down on the waynestock concert .
hi .
we're here to see handsome dan .
i'm wayne campbell .
ja .
i know .
we've been expecting you , wayne campbell .
i am bjergen kjergen .
i love your accent .
where are you from?
i am from sweden .
really?
where abouts in sweden?
knuergen , near the bjoergen fjords .
nice to meet you , bjergen kjergen from knuergen near the bjoergen fjords .
knuergen ...?
that's kluergen province , near bibuergen river .
ja .
now correct me if i'm wrong .
your rainfall varies from 40 inches in the winter to 200 in summer .
and your chief export is modular furniture .
i did a project on sweden in the eighth grade .
i am impressed with your quest for knowledge .
educated men are rare .
i was up all night working on it .
then the next day in gym class ,
i was on the minitramp , and i got diarrhoea .
i really wish i hadn't told you that .
i am sorry to hear of your illness , but since you've sacrificed your health for knowledge of my country , i find you very attractive .
i hope to make love to you in the near future .
ok .
all right .
ok .
all right .
dick van dyke show .
good work , my friend .
yeah .
are you wearing brut?
yes .
my woman likes me in cologne .
wayne , garth , let me get my headset off .
i'll be right out .
hi , handsome dan .
it's great to meet you .
i'm not handsome dan .
hi .
hey .
hi ...
handsome dan .
back with you on wplg , maximum grunt .
our special guests , wayne campbell , garth algar .
wayne's world , all right .
waynestock .
big event .
everybody's excited .
it's gonna be a big concert at adlai stevenson park .
a big party with some great bands .
like aerosmith .
there's still tickets left .
don't wait till the last minute .
'cause it's a chance for the city of aurora ...
to do something ...
fun .
and to put the city on the map .
it's a lot of work .
work is hard .
you're not listening , are you?
i could say anything , like " you're a complete tool " .
you wouldn't hear , 'cause you're a freak with a microphone .
it's not challenging any more .
it's like shooting fish in a barrel .
true , sphincter boy?
what?
oh .
they're getting closer .
good information about waynestock .
we'll be back after plg sports .
it's 16 minutes past the big hour .
right , mr scream?
great .
good stuff .
i think people are getting cranked .
hi .
bobby , it's wayne campbell .
wayne .
how'd you get this number?
it was written on the back of a business card .
i'm looking for cassandra .
i have to talk to her .
it's really important .
i haven't seen her .
she said she might come to ia .
she wasn't definite .
if i hear anything , i'll let you know .
i have to go .
i'm with someone .
i'm sorry i couldn't help .
ok .
thanks .
bye .
important call?
some small time promoter .
let's get some lunch .
what you're saying is that peter lawford warned kennedy not to mess with the military industrial complex .
yeah .
dig this , man ...
j edgar hoover was one bad cat .
i mean , he had a completely different bag from jack .
he just couldn't groove .
when two cats can't groove to the same tune , one of them has to visit the man upstairs .
that's amazing , man .
excuse me .
wayne , i want you to meet a friend of mine , sammy davis jr .
nice to meet you , mr jr .
nice to meet you , too , man .
i gotta split .
i got some cats i gotta hang with .
bye , sammy .
he's a good man .
and now , wayne , what can i do you for?
listen , jim , i'm really confused , ok?
we haven't sold any tickets , we have no bands ,
garth is distracted by chicks , i broke up with my girlfriend , and on top of that , del's gone completely mental .
to complete your journey , you have to help some people along the way .
this next little bit , you'll have to go it alone .
keep the faith , my friend .
if you book them , they will come .
hey , sammy , wait up .
jim , what if nobody shows up?
sand .
cool .
right .
right , moe .
i understand .
nervous?
a little .
i've never been on the tonight show before .
nothing to worry about .
after the show ...
i have to fly to aurora , to waynestock .
waynestock?
what's this waynestock thing?
nothing .
something she has to do .
hold on a second , moe .
listen , bobby's put together some great musicians .
you're making a great album .
together , it can't miss .
you're in good hands .
he's the best .
you listen to bobby and you'll be a big star .
a big star .
moe?
yeah .
we're almost out of time , but i'd just like to point out there are still plenty of excellent waynestock tickets still available .
actually , there are about 10, 000 excellent waynestock tickets still available .
and i'd also like to address a rumour .
there's this rumour that none of the bands have signed and probably no one's gonna show up .
it's true that none of the bands have signed .
jim morrison and his weird naked indian friend visited me in the night and assured me that all the bands will come .
that's all the time we have this week , so until then ...
party on , garth .
party on , wayne .
and we're clear .
all right !
i don't know if you should mention that jim morrison thing any more .
yeah .
it's just that people have started to talk .
they're saying things like ,
hey , there goes garth and his friend wayne ...
... the psychopath .
it's embarrassing .
no offence or nothing .
no .
none taken .
i believe this knife is yours .
it's just that things have started to look a little bleak .
bleak?
what?
hey , no guff , chet .
until you pointed that out , it hadn't occurred to me .
where you going?
mikita's .
the usual .
are you coming?
no .
you guys go and have fun .
i'd probably end up embarrassing you anyways .
no , no .
i'm just gonna to stay here and lick the cat's butt .
just 15 20 minutes three times a week can really make a difference ...
and all the other products?
joe , you know the price .
29 . 95 .
that song is from your album .
oh , man .
she looks great .
it should be out next month , or we hope it will be .
who's we?
who are you looking at?
let's see the guy .
that's bobby cahn , my producer .
that fine looking man?
i'm in the wrong business .
i should be a record producer .
then i'd have attractive women smiling at me .
she will be mine again .
oh , yes .
she will be mine again .
you were terrific .
they loved you .
you think so?
listen to them .
they loved you .
me , too .
i didn't think i could do it without my band .
your guys were so hot .
damn , i had fun .
good .
let's celebrate .
did you think about what i said?
yeah .
i'm still thinking about it .
give me a week?
ok .
w what's the matter?
is anything wrong?
garth , i'm so scared .
has someone hurt you?
i'll take care of it .
i'm a grown up now , you know .
it's ...
it's my husband .
your what?
darling .
i meant to tell you , but my divorce isn't final , and he came over here yesterday , and he was crazy , like an animal .
i wish someone would kill him .
you mean , kill your husband?
no !
don't say it .
you mustn't even think it .
i know you love me , but i won't let you kill my husband .
although i know you want to .
we both know you want to .
then you could have me any time you want .
and i do mean any time .
get me my cigarettes , would you , lover?
they're in my purse .
i'm just so ...
that's a pretty big gun .
darling , all this talk about killing and . 45 magnums with the clip filed down and the safety off .
it's just all so confusing ...
i won't .
i won't .
i won't ...
i won't let you .
he is a dead man .
no way .
you know what?
i got myself into this , i'll get myself out of it .
i'll take it on the chin and be a man .
keep the faith .
if you book them , they will come .
ok .
all right , man .
you got to stop doing that , all right?
oh , man .
hello , is anybody here?
hello .
oh , my god !
rip taylor !
you must be wayne campbell .
yes , i am .
how are you?
very good .
this must be waynestock .
yes , it is .
it's rustic and bucolic , but cute .
thanks .
how are you , pal?
better get ready for the show .
get dressed .
you can see him?
of course i can .
how are you gonna to miss a half naked indian?
rip taylor , garth algar .
rip , you showed up .
cool .
my people got a call from you .
thank you .
before i could say no , this guy came to me in a dream .
i said , " who are you? " he said , " jim morrison .
i'm a dead rock star .
i said , " i'm not familiar with your work . " so he played the doors .
i said , " you're like a crooner in the rock milieu , which i like .
why is our order taking so long?
he said , " you gotta do waynestock .
i figured , what the hey?
what's going on?
don't you know?
we're here for waynestock .
same here .
looking forward to it .
where did they come from?
this is big .
we got to get back to the fields .
have you seen cassandra?
i know .
it's weird .
i don't know where she is , either .
i know .
she said she'd play , and she never misses a gig .
if you see her , send her over to waynestock .
thanks a lot , chief .
all right , bye bye .
wayne !
wayne !
here's what's happening so far .
people have started to show up , but none of the bands are here .
now , if you'll excuse me , i'm going to hurl .
garth , ix nay on the url hay .
think !
where could cassandra be?
i think i had too much jolt cola .
jeff , wayne .
i cannot find your daughter and i'm troubled .
alas , my friend , i've chosen another for my daughter .
you are an excellent warrior , but i require more in a son in law .
he has money .
name the one you have chosen !
he will die by my hand .
his name is bobby .
he has offered security , a career and a green card .
i arranged the match .
though i am sure this will be useless to you so late in the film , they'll be married at the first presbyterian church .
sorry i could not invite you to the wedding .
it's ok .
she's marrying bobby .
what are you doing?
i'm out !
i have to find cassandra and tell her how i feel .
but i can't do the concert alone .
it takes two .
you're right .
i'm in .
but i love her !
i'm freaking out !
what am i gonna do?
go get cassandra .
del and i will run the concert .
just get cassandra and be back before we start .
go , now !
now move it , people !
go !
go !
go !
hi !
i'm kind of busy now .
i just wanted to know if you needed anything from the permit office .
that's a unix book .
yeah .
cool .
all right , men .
our work here is done .
excellent .
where's the first presbyterian church on gordon street?
gordon street !
oh , yeah .
i once knew a girl who lived on gordon street , but that was a long time ago , when i was young .
do we have to put up with this?
can't we get a better actor?
i know it's a small part , but we can do better than this .
gordon street?
oh , yes , gordon street .
i once knew a girl who lived on gordon street .
long time ago , when i was a young man .
not a day passes that i don't think of her , and the promise i made , which i will always keep .
that one perfect day on gordon street .
that's , five blocks up , two over .
thank you .
welcome to aurora !
eat me !
not just a place , but a state of mind .
oh , jesus .
god , no .
hi .
sorry !
sorry , everybody !
wrong wedding !
who's he?
oh , jesus .
god , no .
what an asshole !
son of a bitch !
son of a bitch !
son of a bitch !
you punk .
you crazy punk .
stevenson park !
step on it !
one , one , two , two , two .
check two !
check two !
ok .
we have some word that there is some bad red rope liquorice circulating in the crowd .
repeat , stay away from the red rope liquorice .
do not bite any off and chew it .
it could cause a dental emergency .
excuse me .
excuse me .
guys , huh?
wayne , cassandra , you made it !
this is great !
what'll we do?
the bands haven't showed .
jim morrison said , " if you book them , they will come .
it doesn't look too good .
jim?
jim !
we really are in the desert .
yeah , no guff !
jim morrison .
told you so , man .
how can i help you?
none of the bands have shown up .
i know , and they're not gonna show up .
then why were we supposed to put on a concert?
because you had to try and do something with your life .
but it was a failure .
whether you won or lost , what's important is that you gave it your best shot .
sorry , man .
ok .
all right .
you'll think of something .
it's your movie .
thanks a pantload , chet .
wayne , where are we?
how do we get back?
we don't want to end the movie this way , do we?
good call .
if we're gonna go down , let's at least go down in glory .
let's do the thelma and louise ending .
yeah !
let's just keep going , wayne .
ok , garth .
we don't want to end the movie like this .
yeah .
let's do the happy ending .
the bands haven't shown up .
what'll we do?
what are we going to do , you guys?
you made it .
excellent !
welcome to waynestock .
all right .
jim , why was i supposed to put on this concert?
because you had to learn that it doesn't matter what you do ,
cassandra loves you for who you are .
and that being an adult means facing responsibility , yet still taking the time to have fun .
right .
it's sort of like coming home on friday night and doing your homework right away , so your saturday night is free to just party .
no , i like the way i said it better .
excuse me .
would you open the gate , please?
i have to get in there .
you can't come in .
my girlfriend's in there .
a lot of people's girlfriends are in there .
don't cry .
yeah , we're gonna clean it up .
ok?
see?
see?
