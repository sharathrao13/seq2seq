a cosy little commune .
sure .
taste this .
it's raspberry .
choose the bright colors , not always the depressing ones .
shit !
jan !
what a pain !
bastard !
do you think it was a good idea to move in with jan?
jan is totally alright .
you just have to know him better .
i dunno .
sometimes he gives me this really aggressive look .
really scary .
jule , i've known jan for 15 years .
he's a little unpredictable .
but he's a loyal soul .
and he's got a backbone .
not many people do .
i dunno .
he's kind of weird .
what's that?
oxygen concentrator ...
he bought it " used " the other day .
really?
are you excited about going to barcelona?
sure !
are you excited?
it's just that my debts are out of control .
baby , it's my treat .
completely .
we'll have a great time .
you just don't get it .
i have to straighten this out .
beating yourself up wont make things better .
try to relax !
just forget it .
hello .
man , we have to find a new approach .
take it to another level .
everything is fine .
bullshit !
we need to see things ... in a larger context .
what are you talking about?
forget it !
got a light?
check in my bag .
no .
look in the small one .
open your eyes !
what is this?
looks like a watch to me .
won it at poker?
i think so , yeah .
peter , are you nuts?
no , i won it .
put it back where you found it .
yeah , i'll do that .
ok .
thanks .
man , are you crazy?
what?
you just threw 5000 euros out of the window !
so what?
yeah , so what?
it's a principle !
you and your damn morals !
what morals?
what's it worth if we are seen as common burglars?
if we can't agree , then let's just drop it .
ok , man .
i got it .
but in kreuzberg , i know this turk ...
he would have given me 2500 for it .
we could have split 50/ 50 .
you don't get it and you don't want to !
but it was just sitting there ...
so shiny , calling out to me .
it's green .
change the station .
so far , so far away from home ...
shit it won't get any louder .
no hellos , no hearts , no kisses
no sorrow .
everything so far , so far away .
the best of times
you asshole ! ... where flowers bloom , where my sweetheart lives ...
one more time !
fucking awesome !
miss !
we ordered williams pear brandy .
that's william pear brandy .
but never in these glasses !
these are liqueur glasses .
so?
can't beverages be served in their proper glasses?
i simply cannot drink from this glass .
thank you .
just a moment , please .
by the way ...
don't use the same brandy .
it's lost its flavor , understand?
yes , by all means .
table 47 prefers brandy glasses .
you have more customers .
at table 22 .
dream on your own time !
be careful getting home !
sweet dreams .
you too .
can't you do something else?
putting up those posters doesn't pay much .
plus , you're out all night .
yeah , i'm sick of it too .
but there's nothing else
good night .
what?
you can't go?
i have to turn over the apartment .
that asshole !
i can't believe it .
it's only 3 days .
i don't get it .
shit !
then i'm staying too .
no , this is your big break .
you have to go alone .
i'll find someone to help you , ok?
sorry , i overslept .
you can use this one .
here?
maybe over there .
how about some music?
is that jeff cole?
i saw him in concert .
at the columbia?
i was there .
funny , i didn't see you !
this is a great place .
why move?
i can't afford it .
your debts?
peter told you?
he mentioned it .
that idiot .
it's not a big deal .
we all have debts .
but not like me .
i probably can't compeed but ...
how much?
1000 euros?
10000 euros?
more?
20000?
30000?
jan , please ...
don't ruin my day .
94500 .
euros?
what did you do?
burn down a factory?
if only .
a year ago , on the highway ...
i was in my old golf .
ahead of me , this executive driving his mercedes s class .
he brakes .
i don't .
his car is totaled .
my registration had expired .
i hadn't paid my insurance .
that fucking mercedes cost 100000 euros .
but i'm now down to 94500 .
you work your butt off so that some big shot can drive a mercedes?
for executives like him ...
that car is petty cash .
but it was my fault .
he was in the right
in the right?
is that justice?
you are paying for some jerk's lifestyle .
a 100000 euro car?
why not gold plated pipes?
it makes me sick too !
i should never have reached for the glove compartment .
i screwed up .
now i pay the price .
who says that?
the cops?
the prosecutors , the news rags?
fucking petty bourgeois ethic !
decency , honesty , family values ...
get to work on time , pay your taxes ...
all hammered into us .
first in school , then on tv .
for what?
so guys like that can buy expensive cars?
to hell with those morals !
ruining a young woman's life is immoral .
think that guy ever thought he was wrong?
you are right .
but i missed a payment once ...
they were knocking on my door .
recognizing injustice .
action .
but how?
take the first step alone .
find allies for the second .
from where?
take the first step , then call me .
i calculated how much of my life ...
i'm giving to that asshole ...
just for fun .
and?
about 8 years .
but only once i'm a teacher .
that's what you want to do?
better than waitressing .
and before the accident?
concretely ...
i guess i wanted ...
this might sound stupid .
i guess i just wanted to live wild an free .
that's not stupid .
it's ok .
that's what half of us want .
then come the compromises .
that's how it goes .
not necessarily .
sometimes not .
some people make it .
anyhow ...
if you keep working for that asshole , you'll loose faith in everything .
i go this way .
i go that way .
thanks again .
if you still need help ,
i can come again .
great !
sure .
so where are you headed?
sleeping at a girlfriend's .
how about you?
i think i'll cook something .
want to join me?
gladly .
days of plenty .
all washed up?
shall we cook?
jan , it was great .
guys who can cook must get all the girls .
not really .
other things count more .
you join me for a smoke?
i don't know .
it's dessert .
dope chokes young people's revolutionary energy .
grass too?
no , grass is ok .
the drugs the body produces aren't bad either .
actually , they're greats .
like adrenalin?
for example .
there are thousands .
endorphins ...
happiness hormones when you are in love ...
now you're talking hard drugs .
watch out for those .
don't fall into a life of crime !
fear is an awesome drug .
don't let fear take control .
use it as a motor .
it takes practice .
put yourself into a situation where you're scared stiff .
first there's panic .
but after a while , the body's self protection system kicks in .
you do things you never dared .
you overcome you limitations .
you believe you can do anything .
really !
do you know it or think it?
i know it .
done it a thousand times . a thousand times gone bad ...
run a check on that plate .
it's ok .
it works if you smear it .
it's not good wallpaper .
how come?
the glue isn't right .
but i followed the instructions .
shit !
you know what?
fuck the deposit !
we should have done this before .
it works .
hope they'll like it .
look .
every heart is a revolutionary cell .
smile !
excuse me ...
your hair !
yes , i'll fix it .
roast beef with potatoes and summer vegetables .
we should smoke downstairs in the storeroom .
why not tell him too?
that way he can say all we do is smoke .
you're right .
there you are !
the place is packed .
just fixing my hair .
i can tell .
are you crazy?
in the kitchen?
i'm truly sorry , .
what were you thinking?
know what?
i've had it with you .
that's enough .
you're fired .
no , boss .
i need this job .
it's my fault .
i smoked first .
i said it was ok .
then you are fired too .
what?
pack it up !
wait , jule .
let me .
boss , wait !
why can't i shut up?
what for?
it's great that you defended him .
yeah sure .
but i need that job , you see .
no , i don't see .
you go to all those protests ... against exploitation and oppression ... but you're still some bastard's slave .
those protests are totally useless .
the rebellion is difficult now .
before , all it took was dope and long hair .
and the establishment was automatically against you .
what was considered subversive then you can buy in shops today .
che guevara t shirts or anarchy stickers .
that's why there aren't any more youth movements .
everyone has the feeling it's all be done before .
others tried and failed .
why should it work for us?
for all revolutions , one thing is clear ...
even if some didn t work , the most important thing is ... that the best ideas survived .
the same goes for personal revolts .
what turns out good ... what survives in you ... that makes you stronger .
what do you think?
how many people down there are thinking about revolution?
in this moment , not many .
at 10 : 45 , they are watching tv .
probably .
europeans spend 4 hours a day in front of the boob tube .
4 hours !
terrible !
doesn't leave much time for revolutionary thoughts .
you know ...
not being part of all that ... that's not the problem .
the problem is ...
i can't find anything i really want to believe in .
got any ideas for me?
follow me .
now what?
who lives here?
you never wondered why
peter and i stay out all night?
to put up posters .
what else?
then ...
what do you do?
we are driving around looking for villas .
when we find one we like ... we take a closer look .
then what?
you take pretty photos and put them in an album?
is this a joke?
we break into them .
just one catch .
we don't steal anything .
we re arrange the furniture .
and we leave a message .
your days of plenty are numbered " or " you have too much money " ... signed " the edukators
you and peter are the edukators?
why?
so they feel less safe ... in their high security neighborhoods .
it's a creepy feeling ...
someone has been in your home .
they have been watching you .
and they will keep watching you .
why not empty the villas and give everything to the poor?
they expect burglars .
we want to really scare them .
you have too much money ...
you have too much money ...
they'll feel completely alone .
nothing can help them .
not money , not a spouse , not any damn cop .
are you serious?
i'll show you .
guess where the camera is?
behind the grill .
skeleton key ...
look at this .
peter found this list .
the x's mark our hits .
this is real .
no way ...
this is insane .
how did it start?
not a clue .
peter installed alarm systems .
i once asked him ... if he knew how to disable an alarm system .
he said no problem .
so we did it
you two ...
isn't this zehelendorf?
which street?
finkenbachstrasse .
no way !
wait ...
shit !
jan , shit !
take a left down there , ok?
now i'll show you !
that must be it , there !
stop , pull over there .
i think that asshole ...
i owe money to lives there .
what are you doing?
he really lives here .
the mailbox is full .
they must be away .
let's take a look .
down at the lake we can get in .
don't be a drag !
let's just take a peek .
wait up !
see?
check out this place !
with boat and private dock ...
the blinds are down .
they must be on vacation .
don't be so sure .
how would you break in?
maybe through a cellar window .
let's go closer !
doesn't that look like the ideal point of entry?
totally hidden .
it could work .
let's break .
you're insane .
no way !
i have to see how that asshole lives .
please !
this is too spontaneous .
it's too risky
but you're a pro .
i just want a peek !
jule , i'm not a pro .
we have to monitor the house first .
you can see no one's home .
please !
we can come back a few times .
then do it with peter .
they'll be back then .
but only if the house is on file , which i really doubt .
agreed .
shit !
what?
bingo !
what?
we've got his alarm system .
we are going in?
i'll only have 30 seconds to find the main console .
we do it edukators style .
agreed .
once i open the window , i'll have only 30 seconds .
when the alarm is off , i'll come for you .
so i wait here?
yes .
jan , check out the pool .
come on !
let's make sure no one's home .
it's ok .
i told you ... petty cash .
what are you doing?
don't panic .
less conspicuous than a flashlight .
you can take off you mask .
no one's home .
this is him .
he needs cooling off .
and vertically?
got it?
awesome !
looks much better now !
you have too much money .
the edukators .
ok , let's go .
come on , jan .
let's do something extreme .
i need to work off some aggression .
please !
you're crazy .
we have been here to long .
let's throw the couch in the pool .
it's a great idea .
come on !
let's do it !
then we'll go .
will it pass?
it's hot here .
first things first !
one ... two ...
three !
come on
help me .
idiot !
what's that?
it's me !
where from?
jule , give it back .
come and get it ..
wait here .
i'll be right back .
don't do this , man .
jan , let's go now !
pack our things .
i'll be right back .
got everything?
shit !
what's wrong?
cops !
that was so awesome !
i'd love to see hardenberg's face ! when he comes home and finds his couch in the pool .
it was the best , i tell you .
38 degrees ... the whole city is one big party .
but what was really the best ...
i found this in barcelona .
look .
strange edukators ...
nasty surprise for berlin family , upon return from vacation ,
perpetrators had broken into their villa .
but nothing was stolen .
only furniture and valuables were moved .
the edukators .
police still have no solid leads to their identities " .
which paper?
the tagesanzeiger .
super .
i got this for jule .
think she'll like it?
it's perfect for her .
wake up , man .
you seem out of it .
that must be jule .
how are you?
and you?
everything ok?
i have to tell you something .
wait ...
i brought you something .
we have to talk .
i left my phone at the villa .
what?
really?
i'm pretty sure .
i know i had it in the car before .
it's not in my bag anymore .
don't tell peter .
why not?
just don't tell him anything .
look .
isn't it nice?
try it on .
he really needs a chick .
i'm sure that would help .
really .
jan , see her?
she's been checking you out .
isn't she sweet?
is she sweet or what?
so ask her to dance .
leave him alone .
want me to ask for you?
i'll ask her .
sleep well .
you , too .
bye .
i'm going for a walk .
i need some air .
come in , man .
let's have a drink .
put your oxygen on .
not today .
i'll stay out for a while .
i'm off to bed .
let's get out here .
i have a bad feeling .
we need to find your phone .
but maybe they already saw the hole in the window .
what would you tell the cops?
hardenberg know you .
jan , please .
no .
we have to go back in .
want to go to jail?
it s not here .
where was the jacket?
and?
no .
let's try calling it .
it's on voice mail .
i should've known .
i'll go upstairs .
i have to get rid of fingerprints .
hurry !
i'll be right back .
i just arrived .
where?
home , of course !
rita , i didn't drive 700 km at night to ...
i already told you .
gerling says he needs me .
what could i do?
like i told you , in 3 days if all goes well .
shit !
theresa left the bathroom light on again .
me too .
say hi to the kids .
take care , bye .
found it !
what are you doing here?
i know you ...
hold on !
fucking shit !
is he alive?
should we call the medics?
no .
let's just go .
did he see you?
yes .
did he recognize you?
of course .
then we can't go .
come on .
we can't just go !
think hard !
what are we going to do?
fucking shit !
not a clue !
not a clue , man !
i don't know what to do !
i don't either !
call peter .
no .
why not?
because , no .
but why not?
you call him .
i can't .
what?
just call him !
it can't be ...
this is jule .
jan and i are in big shit .
we need your help .
please come right away .
is this necessary?
just run away .
the police don't have to know .
i won't say anything .
maybe he won't talk .
let's just go .
are you crazy?
that guy lies all day long !
shit !
he dialed the cops .
did the call go through?
we have to go .
but we ...
we're out of time , ok?
he is coming with us .
can't we come to a solution?
shut up !
i won't be a kidnapper !
you can't pull out now !
the cops are coming .
we'll take him and decide later .
end of discussion .
this is crazy !
open the door .
