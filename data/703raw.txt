love is a song that never ends
life may be swift and fleeting
hope may die yet love's beautiful music
comes each day like the dawn
love is a song that never ends
one simple theme repeating
like the voice of a heavenly choir
love's sweet music flows on
like the voice of a heavenly choir
love's sweet music flows on

i'm going to take you to the meadow .
meadow?
what's the meadow?
it's a very wonderful place .
then why haven't we been there before?
you weren't big enough .
mother , you know what?
what?
we're not the only deer in the forest .
where did you hear that?
thumper told me .
well , he's right .
there are many deer in the forest besides us .
then why don't i ever see them?
you will , sometime .
on the meadow?
perhaps .
hush now .
we're almost there .
the meadow .
wait .
bambi , wait .
you must never rush out on the meadow .
there might be danger .
out there , we're unprotected .
the meadow is wide and open , and there are no trees or bushes to hide us .
so we have to be very careful .
wait here .
i'll go out first .
and if the meadow is safe , i'll call you .
come on , bambi .
it's all right .
come on .
good morning , prince bambi .
good morning , young prince .
hello .
what ya eatin '?
clover .
it's awfully good .
it's delicious .
why don't you try some?
no , not that green stuff .
just eat the blossoms .
that's the good stuff .
thumper .
yes , mama?
what did your father tell you?
about what?
about eating the blossoms and leaving the greens?
oh , that one .
eating greens is a special treat .
it makes long ears and great big feet .
but it sure is awful stuff to eat .
i made that last part up myself .
watch out .
that's little faline .
he's kind of bashful , isn't he , mama?
well , maybe he wouldn't be if you'd say hello .
hello , bambi .
i said hello .
well , aren't you going to answer her?
you're not afraid , are you?
well , then , go ahead .
go on , say hello .
hello .
you .
he stopped and looked at me .
yes , i know .
why was everyone still when he came on the meadow?
everyone respects him .
for of all the deer in the forest , not one has lived half so long .
he's very brave and very wise .
that's why he's known as the great prince of the forest .
faline .
bambi .
mother .
bambi .
mother .
come on out , bambi .
come on .
it's safe now .

this is the season to sing
so i'd like to suggest that we all do our best
and warble a song about spring
spring , spring , spring
let's get together and sing
let's sing a gay little spring song
just like bird on the wing
things always seem right when you're cheerful and bright
so let's get together and sing
sing , sing , sing
let's sing a song about spring
let's twitter and tweet like the birdies in may
get into the mood and be merry today
forget all your troubles and warble away ...
wait .
what now?
hey .
stop that racket .
scat .
let's sing a song about spring
i'll fix 'em .
there .
i guess that'll teach 'em .
oh , what's the use?
this is the season to sing ...
same thing every spring .
love's sweet song .
pain in the pin feathers , i call it .
stop it .
get out of here .
all of you .
and you , too .
hello , friend owl .
don't you remember me?
why , it's the young prince .
bambi !
my , my , how you've changed .
turn round there .
let me look at you .
i see you've traded in your spots for a pair of antlers .
you know , just the other day i was talking to myself about you .
and we were wondering what had become of you .
hello , bambi .
remember me?
thumper .
right .
hi , fellas .
flower .
yeah .
well , what's the matter with them?
why are they acting that way?
why , don't you know?
they're " twitterpated " .
twitterpated?
yes .
nearly everybody gets twitterpated in the spring time .
yes .
nearly everybody gets twitterpated in the spring time .
for example , you're walking along , minding your own business , you're looking neither to the left nor to the right , when all of a sudden you run smack into a pretty face .
you begin to get weak in the knees .
your head's in a whirl .
and then you feel light as a feather .
and before you know it , you're walking on air .
and then you know what?
you're knocked for a loop .
and you completely lose your head .
gosh , that's awful .
gee whiz .
terrible .
and that ain't all .
it can happen to anybody .
so you'd better be careful .
it could happen to you , and you , and ...
yes , it could even happen to you .
well , it's not going to happen to me .
me neither .
me neither .
twitterpated .
hello , bambi .
don't you remember me?
i'm faline .
bambi .
i bring you a song
and i sing as i go
for i want you to know
that i'm looking for romance
i bring you a song
in the hope that you'll see
when you're looking at me
that i'm looking for love
i'm seeking that glow
only found when you're young and it's may
only found on that wonderful day
when all longing is through
i'm seeking that glow
only found when a thrill is complete
only found when two hearts gently beat
to the strains of a waltz that's both tender and new
i bring you a song
for i'm seeking romance
you're by my side there's a moon up above
it shines with a light that's so mellow and bright
it's easy to see that tonight we shall fall in love
i bring you a song
for i'm seeking romance
and you
it is man .

love is a song that never ends
one simple theme repeating
like the voice
of a heavenly choir
love's sweet music
flows on
