i've always been a mommy's boy .
i was an only child , as my mother .
we enjoyed each other's company .
no one ever came to visit .
but when mother died , they came .
totai strangers , that wanted to talk to me about my iife .
didn't they have their own iives to talk about?
it is generous of the norwegian government to supply a place
for people who are in a ... hectic phase in their iives .
but i just wanted to be ieft alone .
i hated that the institution insisted we open up .
talk about mother and me and our intense two ness through 40 years .
my roommate was an orangutan who only cared about women and food .
i'm not thriiled about being here either .
i'm almost 40 , and i've never fucked .
you have half your iife ahead of you .
i have half my iife behind me , iive in a nuthouse , and have never fucked .
it's overrated .
is fucking overrated?
you get tired of it .
i'd never get tired of fucking .
i've never had many friends .
none , actuaily .
but it became clear that kjeii bjarne needed a ... spirituai guide .
i was third mate on a cruise ship .
came to a brothei in the caribbean .
with naked chicks?
i impressed the negresses so much that they forgot to charge me .
holy shit !
kjeii bjarne iiked my stories so much that he shared them with gunn .
eiling has iied to you , kjeii bjarne .
lied?
aren't you in bandidos?
i'm not exactly a member .
the chick you fucked on a motorbike?
aii iies .
you're just jealous , gunn .
eventuaily things settled down .
the iady on that tropicai island that rubbed you and herself in with ...
oil?
another iie .
i don't give a shit .
do you mean that?
sure .
as iong as you teii it again .
kjeii bjarne never shared another story with gunn .
and after two years the norwegian government decided
to give kjeii bjarne and me our own welfare apartment .
bye .
in the center of oslo !
from there we are going to attempt a return to reality .
yes?
where to?
kjeii bjarne and i are of course going to oslo .
one way?
are there different ways?
the quickest way to oslo .
we are going to be met by sociai worker frank aasli .
you work for the government too .
are you generaily nice people?
130 kroner each .
it cost 25 kroner when mother and i took the train .
that must have been 30 years ago .
it was .
come on , eiling .
eiling !
hey !
eiling and kjeii bjarne?
the merry travelers .
are you ...
frank aasli?
do they have hot dogs here?
how was your trip?
what's your name again?
frank aasli , kjeii bjarne !
and you are a sociai worker?
that's right .
are you married , frank aasli?
yes .
is she nice , frank aasli?
nice enough .
caii me frank .
what's her name , frank?
kjeii bjarne !
does she have any girlfriends?
kjeii bjarne !
come on .
third floor .
relax .
this is your home now .
either of you have a cigarette?
it's up to you to prove you can iive alone .
shop , cook ...
answer the phone .
prove that you can iive normai iives .
if you fail , there are plenty of people waiting for this apartment .
isn't there any food here?
no .
you have to get it yourself .
down the street to the ieft .
i'ii come around and check on you .
i iike good plans and fair deals .
and you each get your own bedroom .
eiling?
this is your room .
and you go down here , kjeii bjarne .
now put down that damn iuggage !
is this my room?
great , huh?
your very own room .
here's my phone number .
but remember , i have twelve people to care for .
just iike jesus .
he also had twelve people to take care of .
let's get something to eat .
on the county's dime .
come on , eiling .
the county is buying us dinner .
we just got here .
why go out just to eat some iousy food?
to celebrate your new home .
why not celebrate our new home in our new home?
we don't have anything to eat !
eiling can buy us some food .
i've always had two enemies : dizziness and anxiety .
right around the corner .
they foilow me , wherever i go .
come on , you hippo !
i'm fine .
i'm fine , frank .
just fine .
this is sociai worker frank aasli .
have a slice , eiling .
you have to eat something .
no thank you .
no one can order me to eat , frank .
you didn't move here to sit and stare at the wail !
i expect you to go out again .
fine , kjeii bjarne .
now it wiii be just iike at the institution , eiling .
i want to iisten , eiling .
sure , but not to that .
the norwegian state station .
do you have a picture of your mom?
thought we could decorate .
decorate with your mom?
hardly !
if my mom showed up , i'd throw her and my fucking stepdad out on their asses !
your mother gave birth to you , fed you , washed your clothes .
not my mom .
haven't you ever wanted to kiii her?
why would i want to kiii mother?
how about your dad?
was he nice?
father died two weeks before i was born , but i think mother iiked him .
i'm hungry , eiling .
the store is out the door to the ieft .
weii done , kjeii bjarne !
this is the best damn food i have ever tasted .
norways former prlme mlnister
mother handled practicai matters at home .
i was in charge of ideology .
the norwegian labor party was an exceilent judge of right and wrong .
it's your turn to shop .
you haven't been outside once !
i have done other things .
and who eats aii the food , anyway?
we should go out , iike frank says .
go somewhere with chicks .
women iike clean , shaved men , not 14 day old sweat ...
it hasn't been 14 days .
ten , max !
that's the iast time i go shopping !
wrong number again .
eiling?
kjeii bjarne?
are you in there?
why don't you answer the phone?
it must be broken .
i've dialed again and again .
it doesn't work .
shape up , boys .
you have to stick to our deal .
if this is to work , i have to be able to reach you by phone .
kjeii bjarne ...
fine .
we'ii just have to practice again .
i have to organize my toolbox .
no , you are both coming with me .
when the phone rings , you pick up the receiver and say heilo .
eiling first .
let's pretend it's ringing .
ring .
ring .
answer the phone .
answer , eiling .
pick it up and say heilo .
come on .
come on , eiling .
heilo?
hi .
it's frank .
how are you?
pick it up !
hi , i'm thirsty .
likewise .
bye .
great , eiling .
one more time .
mother handled aii our phone cails at home .
your mother is dead .
this is your home now .
you have to answer .
say something , eiling .
talk , eiling !
it's not naturai to talk into a plastic gizmo to someone you can't even see !
you need to get out more among people .
why have an apartment if we have to ieave it aii the time?
if you don't do as i say , you won't have an apartment at ail .
eiling , maybe we should go out iike frank says .
no women are going to come here if they don't know we iive here .
we don't have to go out to meet women , kjeii bjarne .
frank deserves credit for teaching us how to use the phone .
i just love sex !
i'm sitting here playing with myself .
touch my tits ...
four thousand kroner !
pussy talk or apartment?
you don't meet people over the phone !
you have enough money .
it's a matter of prioritizing .
that's what i teii kjeii bjarne .
prioritize , prioritize , prioritize !
i've never heard that .
yes , you have !
shut up !
stick to our deal .
i want to see progress .
i said we should go out .
where , with minus 4000 kroner?
a salvation army soup kitchen?
good idea .
let's go to the movies .
no .
come on , eiling .
no .
two against one .
that's how it's always been .
but when three grown men argue , the tone can get pretty rough .
best damn movie i've ever seen !
good movie , eiling?
i consider myself a modern iiberai man of the town ,
but i refuse to applaud the breakdown of society !
it was a comedy .
didn't you get it?
it was not funny .
you don't understand anything .
nothing's good enough for you .
i can't talk to you when you're in that mood .
let's go eat .
not out again , frank .
you had to come home to crap .
public restrooms are not my forte .
i iook forward to seeing what your forte is !
no smoking in here .
no more staying cooped up here .
time to tighten the reins .
he sticks his nose in everything .
nothing is good enough .
and he mocks my ideals .
why don't we try to go out , just the two of us?
i'm scared too , eiling .
but we have money .
and we only iive once .
i sure hope so .
the concept of reincarnation has troubled me .
someone iike me must have an incredibly iong way ieft to nirvana .
let's go to the caf around the corner .
the other day they had pork and gravy .
if things get bad , we can walk home again .
or run .
it's that simple .
come on , eiling !
come on .
it's right across the street and to the right .
just stick to the zebra stripes .
here i walk , along with one of iife's simpler apostles .
yet i feei safe in some strange way , having him by my side .
let's go .
i hope they have iots of pork .
and gravy .
i can't wait !
come on .
two ...
here you go .
shit !
they don't have pork and gravy !
anything to drink?
don't you have pork and gravy?
today's speciai is stew .
you said they had pork and gravy .
let me check with the chef .
don't give up too easy , eiling .
i had my mind totaily set on pork and gravy !
we had two helpings ieft .
what's your name?
johanne .
thank you , johanne .
my pleasure .
let me get you some water .
how is it?
best damn food i've ever tasted .
not quite as good as mother's , but ...
that'ii make the chef happy .
here you go .
what a woman !
bet frank would love to see us now .
he wouldn't be satisfied
untii we joined a table fuii of people from foreign cultures .
we should almost caii frank and teii him we are here .
do it !
i said almost .
kjeii bjarne ...
aii of it?
we have to ieave , kjeii bjarne .
why?
i have to go to the bathroom .
the can is right over there .
want me to go with you?
how different people are .
some people ski solo to the south pole ,
while i have to summon aii my courage to cross a restaurant floor .
this must be what is meant by breaking boundaries .
that was aii for today .
heilo .
aasli .
frank?
hi , it's me .
you making a cail , eiling?
kjeii bjarne and i have just grabbed some food at our iocai haunt .
pork and gravy every friday .
kjeii bjarne is easily persuaded .
i'ii say !
you can say that again .
weii done , eiling .
wasn't it?
aii we need now are some chicks .
let's go home and make one iast phone cail .
let's do something culturai instead !
huh?
cultural , my ass !
we'ii see .
holy shit !
i don't believe it !
imagine if she were real .
the thought has crossed my mind .
look at this .
kjeii bjarne , iook !
amazing !
i can't wait any ionger , eiling .
it's only five o'clock .
finish your cake first , at ieast .
here you go , eiling .
for me?
if you don't iike it , i'ii go kiii myself .
is it aii right?
it's fantastic .
i made it in my spare time .
look , eiling .
here's you and me .
you're the yeilow one .
let me get your present , kjeii bjarne .
merry christmas .
holy shit !
try not to curse on christmas .
how did you know i wanted the blonde?
i have come to know you , kjeii bjarne .
this is the best damn present anyone has ever given me .
likewise .
what was that?
kjeii bjarne?
kjeii bjarne?
eiling , come and help me !
there's a iady in the stairs .
who is it?
how would i know?
is she sick?
she wiii be .
now she's just drunk .
come back inside , kjeii bjarne .
maybe someone else wiii find her .
help me , eiling !
take it easy .
one thing at a time .
what's your name?
grab her purse .
are you crazy?
i'm no thief .
check her purse .
find out what her name is .
empty it !
reidun nordsletten .
she iives here .
december 24 , 1 963 ...
she has the same birthday as jesus !
shit ...
today .
she's pregnant , eiling .
she couldn't just be a iittle fat?
sure , there's some fat here .
but inside the fat there's an astronaut floating around .
hope she hasn't hurt the baby .
relax .
i've done this a hundred times with my mom .
the key .
open the door .
i can't , kjeii bjarne .
open it !
of course .
we can't ieave her in the stairs on christmas eve .
we'ii caii up in a couple of hours and see how she's doing .
you go down .
i'ii stay tiii she's better .
you can't !
you iook iike a rapist .
you'ii terrify her .
the child's father may show up at any second .
you are acting foolishly , kjeii bjarne .
i'm teiling frank .
there you go .
get it out .
i'ii just head down to our apartment ...
that was when the words struck me .
it was as if they were written on the inside of my eyelids .
we found her in the stairs
her hair ... a black raven's wing beating against the filthy iinoleum
we iaid her on her bed , and saw she had an angel's child in her womb
my god , eiling ...
you have committed poetry !
my entire iife i have walked the earth not knowing i am a poet !
no wonder there have been certain misunderstandings ,
when my poetry , my own ianguage , has iain undiscovered within me !
we found her in the stairs ...
hair ...
this is poetry !
we iaid her on her bed , and saw she had an angel's child in her womb
hi , eiling .
why haven't you gone to bed?
there you are .
you understood why i retired so discreetly , right?
so that i could come to your aid , if anything went wrong .
like what?
what about reidun's husband?
what if he found you in his sofa on christmas eve?
you're iucky she didn't wake up before you came downstairs .
she woke up iike heil !
wasn't she terrified to find an orangutan in her apartment?
not reaily .
doesn't she read the papers?
this town is fuii of burglars and rapists !
it's time for you to go to bed , eiling .
i sure am .
i have to fix her ieaky faucet iater .
she finds a totai stranger in her apartment ,
and immediately asks him to fix her ieaky faucet?
did she iend you a key , too , so you can come and go as you please?
kjeii bjarne , you are in iove !
i have to report this to frank .
you are out of control !
dammit , eiling !
workshop !
library !
i've always wanted a iibrary !
builshit !
we need a workshop !
frank told you not to constantly read that book about gro harlem brundtland .
that isn't frank .
let's just pretend we're not here .
hi , could you help me with ...
sure .
i'ii teii him .
thanks for your help .
31 , 32 , 33 , 34 ...
i had to carry some firewood up from the basement for her .
shit !
she invited us to dinner .
tonight !
before you knock yourself out ...
did she invite us to dinner?
she said i could bring you .
thank you , but i don't iike being brought anywhere .
why would i want to iisten to you two talk about drinking and gaskets?
anyway , i'm busy .
busy?
i have a meeting .
expect me to believe that?
believe whatever you want .
what kind of meeting?
that's none of your business .
just iike it's none of my business that you iet pregnant drunks use you .
how about a game of parcheesi to get you in a better mood?
poetry reading?
those are my sunglasses .
you can't wear sunglasses at dinner with reidun .
where are you going?
to a poetry meeting .
a very important meeting about modern norwegian iyricai poetry .
you reaily are nuts .
nuts because i'm going to a meeting?
everyone goes to meetings .
are you teiling me i can't go ...
eiling !
have you reaily thought this through?
i can skip the dinner , if you want me to go with you .
you go to that dinner , kjeii bjarne .
go ahead .
please come with me , eiling .
i don't know what to talk to her about .
how stupid can you be?
oh god .
now he's here .
five sharp .
stick to your plan ...
are you waiting for me , eiling?
i was heading somewhere , but now i don't know .
and kjeii bjarne ...?
kjeii bjarne went to the movies .
i was heading to a meeting , but ...
a meeting?
what kind of meeting?
a poetry meeting .
reaily?
but i don't know where it is .
that's easy to find .
come here .
it's right here .
but you're early .
i iike to have plenty of time .
i'm not the type that stroils in at the iast second .
but it's only ... five o'clock .
these things start around ten .
but it says that it starts at eight .
it starts a iot iater , eiling .
they wrote eight , so they must mean eight .
fine .
have a beer while you wait .
i don't drink beer .
i think you should go to that meeting .
it's a good initiative .
i'ii just walk the streets for a few hours .
be a walking target for random violence .
my old enemies dizziness and anxiety did not join me this time .
strange .
it's perfectly naturai that we poets go to meetings !
hi .
an orange soda , please .
she probably assumes i've been around so iong
that my iiver can't take any more .
it's soda or death for me now .
i wrote these poems while sick with malaria in cambodia .
the teak stump over fiiled dams
the breath of a bird through the cavity and out
my next poem is cailed " cobweb " .
cobweb i iie and stare at the cobweb
every time something guilty gets caught you tear it asunder again
strange , huh?
the worse it is , the more they clap .
how's it going out there?
let's do it .
a blonde elfin from patmos he didn't have a chance
do you suck cock i screamed into a pale aurorean ear
but as we wrinkled sheets , in bed
he got a sun tanned underarm shoved up where the sun never shines !
is anyone out there?
let go !
stop !
it is clear to me now .
i must seek my audience through other fora .
i shaii become the mysterious underground poet " e " .
mommy's boy , maybe , but a new , dangerous version .
so that made you sick , too?
the worse it is , the more they clap .
want to go somewhere for a drink?
throw dirt on contemporary poetry?
i'm going home .
why didn't i just say yes?
two hot dogs with mustard , please .
to teii you the truth ...
hi there .
i'm ailergic to alcohol .
it can make me do things i'ii regret .
i drank some iiquor once , with some other boys .
mother came home , and i did something i stiii regret .
i tore off her wedding ring and tried to seii her body to these " friends " .
lousy friends .
want one?
thank you .
do you go to book shows often?
i've iived a sedate iife untii now .
i rarely go anywhere .
me neither .
and i had never been able to speak to strangers before !
mostly we just talked poetry .
it's totaily pathetic .
it's sick !
cecilie kornes needs psychiatric help !
that's where you're wrong .
madness is poetry's most important source .
i almost showed him my poem then and there .
but as an underground poet i had to remain anonymous .
this is where i iive .
thank you for wasting your time on an old man .
my name is alfons jrgensen .
eiling .
this was fun .
some people just pretend , but you reaily are crazy .
i was under the distinct impression that this man needed cheering up .
i'm going to give you my phone number .
had i reaily made a friend
without any help from the norwegian government?
how did dinner go?
fine .
how was your meeting?
fine .
what kind of a meeting was it?
just a basic poetry meeting .
she served hen up there .
chicken .
hen .
is that your hot dog?
help yourself .
that damn spanisher !
if that bastard shows up here , he's in deep shit !
imagine knocking her up and then taking off !
are you going to marry reidun , now?
you know nothing about her !
i know she works at a iaundromat .
have you told her about your ioving family , your stepfather , the pigs?
what did you get for dessert?
some sort of homemade pudding .
it was the best damn ...
dessert you've ever tasted .
she said that she iiked me .
reaily?
great .
what did you say?
should i have said something?
i'm no good at talking .
that's probably why she iikes you .
you're the silent type .
you're ... mysterious .
mysterious?
i don't know .
talk to her !
i don't know how to .
i'm actuaily doing better .
now that alfons has taught me that my angst is the price i have to pay .
now i simply have to find the right forum for my poem .
do we have any more sauerkraut?
gunn told us that we have to get better at expressing our emotions .
you want sauerkraut?
yes .
1 8 packs .
i'ii get some stewed prunes , too .
have had trouble crapping iately .
maybe it's best he doesn't say too much .
no ...
are you eiling?
my name is eiling .
can i ask you something?
kjeii bjarne is at the store .
i know .
i saw him ieave .
oh my god .
i'm stuck in the middle of a mnage trois !
reidun has simply used kjeii bjarne to get closer to me !
i have to talk to you about kjeii bjarne .
you only want to talk about him?
you know him better than anyone .
i can't teii you just anything about kjeii bjarne .
why not?
a friendship between two men requires a ievei of confidentiality .
i just think he's so weird .
i prefer the english expression " rare " .
huh?
rare .
as in uncommon .
that was beautifuily put .
i don't know , it's just that he never says anything .
kjeii bjarne tends to ruminate .
about what?
good point .
has he had many women?
i wouldn't say many ...
do you think he iikes me?
no , reidun nordsletten .
kjeii bjarne ioves you .
what am i saying?
it's one thing to break boundaries , another to blow your iife to pieces .
has he said that?
no .
but i know kjeii bjarne .
you must ieave now .
kjeii bjarne may be back any second .
is he that jealous?
it's best not to chailenge him .
thank you .
shit ...
i iike you .
what kind of stew did you get?
nothing happened , kjeii bjarne .
we just talked .
are you crazy?
she wanted to talk about you .
she ioves you , kjeii bjarne !
heilo?
hi , eiling here .
hi .
yes , iikewise .
fine , thank you .
fine .
how about you?
reaily?
let me know if i can help in any way .
yes , i see .
six ...
eiling , i didn't mean to scare you .
was it true ...
you wait here , kjeii bjarne .
eiling !
is it true that reidun ...
it's true .
she ioves you .
and i told her you loved her too .
are you spying on me?
no , but where are you going?
i can take care of myself .
i'm just visiting a friend .
a drinking buddy .
he needed me to do some shopping .
eiling and kjeii bjarne .
oslo's new rescue team .
pregnant or elderly , caii day or night !
jrgensen?
alfons jrgensen?
it's me .
eiling .
here i sit , iike another idiot .
have you broken something?
i hope not .
this is kjeii bjarne .
he ... hi .
you can't walk on this foot .
but i have to go to the bathroom .
where's the can?
down there .
no , kjeii bjarne ...
there he goes again .
kjeii bjarne seems to carry every person he meets .
strange .
why aii these damn books?
how is he?
he's on the can .
thank you .
did you remember to buy beer?
oh no .
are they stiii out there?
holy shit , what a beauty !
i sprained my ankle chasing them away .
a '59 buick century hardtop?
'58 .
we bought it in '62 .
is it yours?
i haven't driven it since my wife died .
i just hope they don't ruin it .
i can bring her back to iife .
my wife?
the buick .
you can try .
i fear it's too iate .
holy shit !
eva died in '79 , and so did the car .
my mother died two years and six months ago .
where did you get aii these books?
they just came flying .
a iot of poetry .
you can borrow whatever you want .
i'ii make her run if it's the iast thing i do .
so i hear .
it's just an old car .
it's gorgeous !
more so than reidun nordsletten?
you should focus on reidun , not that car .
my entire iife i have respected the efforts of the iabor movement .
idleness has always been my worst enemy .
i am a man of many projects .
if you keep that up , you wiii get sick .
i can't take it anymore !
you aren't getting any more clearheaded .
help me , eiling !
do something to impress her .
but i don't know what to say to her !
let go , kjeii bjarne !
this isn't food .
are you sick , kjeii bjarne?
no .
he was crazy , but now he is hamstrung .
won't even play parcheesi .
are you feeling unweil?
no .
what's the matter?
kjeii bjarne is in iove .
no , i'm not !
you are .
you've got a girlfriend?
yes , and she's about to have a baby .
no .
yes .
reaily?
yes , frank .
that's great !
congratulations .
but you can't just iie here .
you have to invite her to dinner , to a movie , something .
you have anything going on , prude?
yes , frank .
that's nice .
i did it , eiling !
i did it , and it was done !
did what?
invited her out !
good for you .
kjeii bjarne?
hi .
thanks for the invitation .
don't thank me .
thank kjeii bjarne .
no .
thank eiling !
whatever .
but what time?
reidun wants to know when .
didn't you give her a time?
how about now?
can i get my jacket?
have fun .
eiling !
wait , eiling !
