come on , man .
come on .
let it go !
bring it on !
yeah !
see you .
come on , man .
oh , i'm scared .
come on , man !
chill , man !
let it go .
it's not worth it .
hey , boys from beantown , why don't you say hello to billy buckner !
okay , i'm in .
yeah , the same thing with you , right?
come on .
what's going on?
we're getting out of here .
what happened to these guys?
bad sushi .
this is a joke , right?
these are the guys she wants as her co stars?
actually , just walt .
he's the one in the white jacket .
i don't get it .
oh , i do .
you see , cher thinks she's being slick .
isn't that right , howard?
she's trying to force us to pull the plug on the show .
no , come on , terry !
hey , look at me .
i swear on my kids , it's got nothing to do with that .
well , i got a message for cher .
tell her we start shooting first thing monday morning .
what kind of deal you looking for?
basically , it's the same deal i got for kitty carlisle in what's my line?
twelve hundred and fifty dollars?
per show .
and that's not all .
he gets his own dressing room with a star ... ... and a fresh pot of coffee every morning .
and none of that cheap stuff .
folgers crystals .
that's very doable .
what are we looking for on the back end?
you mean the brother?
bob doesn't really act .
how about 50 bucks a week and his own dressing room?
hi , are you attorney honey garret?
who's asking?
oh , i'm terribly sorry .
name's mack beasley .
i understand your law firm is looking for a crime scene detective .
all right , mr. beasley , you have five minutes .
well , i appreciate you taking the time .
this is quite an office you work out of .
yes , i know .
so ....
well , mr. beasley , what are your qualifications?
well , i'm a rhodes scholar .
i have a ph. d. in bio analysis .
i trained with the navy seals for , let's see , seven years ... ... and i won the heisman trophy .
twice .
well , here , fill this out ... ... and i'll see if i can squeeze you into an entry level position .
fantastic .
let me tell you , you won't regret this .
if you need any references or anything ... ... i can certainly furnish you with everything that
bob , bob , bob , you're killing me .
you're really cut it .
cut it .
ten .
that's 10 times .
please , let's go .
it's okay .
it's just very , very important that you stay on your mark .
yeah , i'm just i am a little nervous .
i have some opening day jitters .
it's okay , kid .
it's just , you have to stay out of frame .
okay?
otherwise , the whole show won't work .
all right?
griffin , back home at the oak bluffs playhouse ... ... we used to disguise him as different props .
right .
great idea , we'll turn bob into a bush .
it might not be such a bad idea .
it is a terrible idea !
the network has made it very clear that the kid stays out of the picture .
and this way we don't have to explain why the beaze is followed by a bush .
still gotta explain the sucky dialogue .
hey , hey , hey .
i'm sorry , bob , do you now have a problem with the script?
no , no , no , the script is awesome , sir .
it's just the dialogue .
i mean , every guy knows that archie griffin's the only guy ...
... who won the heisman twice .
archie who?
hey , bob , just cool it , okay?
he didn't mean it .
the kid's right .
this script sucks .
griffin , come here .
why don't we just give bob a chance to write the script?
yeah , right .
bob , you ever written for television?
no .
see how perfect this is?
we can get rid of the old hacks ... ... that wrote this crap , get some fresh blood .
are you suggesting that we bring in the bush ...
yeah . ... to punch up the script?
look , you gotta go with me on this .
i got a good feeling about this guy .
i don't believe this .
i just l
all right , everybody , that's , you know , that's a wrap .
okay , folks , that's a wrap !
congratulations ...
... you're the new head writer .
thanks .
cher !
cher !
no , no .
no !
ls your throat sore?
are you achy?
i'm just feeling a little run down .
i was up all night studying lines with walt , so that's probably what did it .
is that why he got you the big teddy bear?
yeah .
he really went overboard this time .
now , get some rest .
and i'll see you tomorrow .
okay .
thanks for the " neo tu tong .
bye bye .
jeez , i thought she'd never leave .
i am a terrible person .
i don't know why you're doing this .
why don't you just tell her?
you're right .
the time has come .
you know?
by the way , i gotta give you some credit for bringing moe on as a writer .
he's really given the beaze character some dignity , you know?
i don't want to be an actor who takes a role and ends up looking like an ass .
know what i mean?
i just can't believe this .
it's like a miracle .
it's not a miracle .
walt's a great actor .
yeah , but bob can't act .
how are they gonna pull this off?
hush .
it's starting .
hey !
watch the show , you dumb shit !
miss garret , there's a mack beasley here to see you ,
i don 't know any mack beasley , get rid of him ,
i'm sorry , i told him not to  are you honey garret?
just who the hell do you think you are , barging in here?
i figured i had a right ,
according to this cocktail napkin , i'm half owner of this law firm ,
where did you get this?
won it off a drunk at a poker game ,
that drunk happens to be my ex husband ,
i can see what drove him to the bottle , you son of a
i meant losing a beautiful squaw like you would drive any man to the firewater ,
you see that?
that was bob .
where?
he was right there .
you got farts in your head .
l 'm telling you , i saw his nose !
i'll keep this ,,,,
there he is again .
it is his honker !
yeah , that's him .
that's him .
oh , my , bob looks very good .
he's lost a little weight and he nice tan .
with chromakey , the camera picks up every color except for blue .
to the audience at home , you don't exist .
hey , bob , put your mask down .
check it out .
wow .
i look incredible .
look at that .
what the hell is this?
oh , we're giving walt a chance to spread his wings .
well , he was doing just fine before .
well , now he'll do even finer .
barney .
check out what i'm doing to cher's butt .
hey .
you like that , huh?
put some junk in her trunk .
can i talk to you in private?
sure , cher .
don't you realize how morally repugnant and politically incorrect it is ... ... to hide walt's god given siamese ness?
your concern is very touching , cher , but let's live in the real world .
america isn't ready for that .
besides , bob doesn't want to act .
i just don't believe bob should be cut out .
we do .
you seen today's trades?
despite its generic title , honey and the beaze should generate solid buzz .
with snappy writing that pokes fun at an all too familiar genre ...
... show deserves to find an audience .
hey !
newcomer walt tenor's inspired turn as cocky but sensitive ... ... biochemist mack beasley more than compensates for a lackluster perf ... ... by cher and indifferent direction by actor turned helmer griffin dunne .
tech credits are run of the mill .
it's a rave , guys !
great .
son of a gun .
this baby may just make it .
oh , excuse me , miss cher .
there's a few fans outside hoping for autographs .
all right , but i'm not taking any pictures .
no , no , no  what's this?
shit , it's just cher .
sorry , i should have specified .
they're looking for walt .
seen him?
hey , lady , can you go get the beaze for us?
we want beaze !
we want beaze !
we want beaze !
hey .
you wouldn't happen to know if bob was alone , would you?
i highly doubt it .
okay .
bob?
hello?
i've got a surprise for mr. sick in bed .
oh .
i'm sorry .
i was looking for bob .
what?
what?
may?
oh , my god .
you're not brothers , you
no , may , no !
it's not what you think !
may !
may , wait !
wait !
may !
it's not what you think .
listen to me .
i don't have to listen to anything .
i have eyes !
well , then use them .
oh , my god .
please ... ... don't go .
i wonder what she's got under that hood .
i'm really sorry , bob .
it's not your fault .
don't worry .
she'll be back .
where else is she gonna find a guy like you?
i don't know .
chernobyl?
don't worry , boys .
we're gonna hit this thing head on .
what thing?
someone ratted you out , boys .
it's gonna be all over the 5 : 00 news .
cronkite's gonna have a field day with this .
in the wake of the startling revelation that walt tenor ,,, ,,, of honey and the beaze is a conjoined twin ,,, ,,, sponsors are running for the hills ,
let's get out of here before johnny press comes sniffing around .
come on .
what are you waiting for?
we stand firmly by our decision to hire mr. tenor .
sadly , the realities of our business template are such ... ... that with the loss of our sponsors ... ... we are forced to halt production until further notice .
we will , however , run the final three episodes , as scheduled .
here's the plan .
we're gonna canvass all 48 states with denials .
now , i'm giving you the same advice i gave hudson in '56 .
deny , deny , deny .
right .
deny what?
that there's two of you where one should be .
i got a better idea .
who asked you , trixie?
these are my clients .
they'll do as i say .
wait , what's your idea?
hey , hey , hey , what is this , a minute iny?
it's really simple .
don't " deny , deny , deny .
embrace .
you know walt tenor from the series honey and the beaze ,
his secret is out , you all know it , he's here to share it ,

oh , okay !
you were an all state hockey goalie ,
but walt was honorable mention ,
oh , okay , oh , come on ,

it's awesome .
i'm really happy for you , walt .

i have never seen you happier .

i'm a gimmick , not an actor .
we've been over this a million times .

and for the record , i'm perfectly happy with how i am .
no , you're not .
you're in love with may .
only you two don't stand a chance ... ... until you can learn to stand on your own two feet .
you know , if that's how she feels , then , you know , the hell with her .
no , no , this isn't how she feels , bob .
this is about how you feel .
you're the one who couldn't tell her the truth .
no , okay  and let me finish .
just think about this .
imagine playing a round of golf alone .
slow dancing with a woman without me breathing down your neck .
masturbating in private the way the good lord intended .
what are you talking about?
come on , last night was like sleeping next to a paint shaker .
it is it's not that simple .
i mean ....

you don't have to do that .
look , this is a hard thing for anyone to handle .
bob , but that doesn't  may .

i was surprised .
you lied to me for three years .
but i thought about this a lot .
it doesn't matter .

you're saying that you could have a relationship ... ... even with this?
it's a speed bump .
i love you .
i love you just as you are .
