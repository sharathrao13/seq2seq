ring around the rosy
now , i'm trying to tell you ... that we can't afford to keep you here anymore .
you already owe two months worth of back rent .
it's mine , and you're not taking it away .
read the will , nell .
the executor shall have the right to dispose of ... any and all personal property as he shall see fit .
he's not even real family .
yeah , well , maybe not .
but clearly , mother thought lou would be much better equipped ... to deal with these unpleasant details than you .
unpleasant details "?
what have i been dealing with for the past 11 years?
i've cooked , cleaned , mopped up her urine !
you call that an " unpleasant detail "?
hey , your sister didn't write the will .
we all know what you've done .
we're trying to help .
do not help me !
oh , ritchie .
just go sit on the couch , okay?
oh .
anyway , once probate closes , we can put this apartment on the market , and we all might be able to make a few bucks .
also , we know how much you love mom's car , so we're giving it to you .
you're taking away my home and giving me a 20 year old car?
absolutely .
we'll deduct the value from the proceeds of the apartment .
who are you?
do you understand that i have nowhere to go?
we've been talking , and lou and i are very busy .
we could use someone to help us with the cleaning and the cooking ,
looking after ritchie?
eleanor , help me .
i gotta pee .
ritchie , not now !
get outta my home .
well , suit yourself .
we'll let the courts handle it .
get out of my home .
honey , let go .
that's right .
oops .
sorry .
okay .
here you go , honey .
follow daddy .
come live with us , nell .
you have no idea how hard it is out there .
no , jane .
you have no idea how hard it was in here .
hello .
yes , this is eleanor .
where?
i see it .
research subjects .
nine hundred a week .
here's how they're organized .
the groups have very different personalities .
scored all over the kiersey temperament sorter , just like you asked for , and they all score very high on the insomnia charts .
oh , what a beautiful profile .
a classic dependent personality disorder .
however , we were looking for " suggestible .
her mother died two months ago .
she really wants to do this .
and what are your feelings , mary?
tell me what your intuitions say .
i put my favorites on top .
mm hmm .
what else have we got here?
low self esteem , high narcissism , chronic feeling of emptiness , identity disturbance .
good , good .
very good .
is this where we're going?
that's hill house .
that's perfect , isn't it?
the hill house project  is absolutely essential to my research , malcom .
no , just listen .
i grant you , fear and performance is a big , sexy idea .
but as chairman of this department , i cannot  i know you clinical guys ... don't like to ask these questions , but think about it .
what is fear , anyway?
it's a series of automatic responses to a given stimulus , characterized by increased heart rate , respiratory activity and adrenaline function .
the only problem with fear is that it has largely become inappropriate and nonadaptive .
do sweaty palms help to talk to your boss?
does a racing pulse help some kid's score on an sat?
and yet we carry with us these primordial fear responses ... that do the opposite of what they were intended to do .
so why is that?
david , david , no one is saying ... that these aren't provocative questions .
but you can't conduct this research ethically or responsibly .
and on top of that , you're bringing your insomniacs ... to this house under false pretenses .
because the experiment needs a credible cover story .
calling it an insomnia study ... allows me to create a highly suggestive environment ... to investigate the dynamics of fear .
you don't tell the rats they're actually in a maze , malcom .
come on .
what do you want?
are are you mr. dudley , the caretaker?
yeah .
i'm mr. dudley , the caretaker .
what are you doing here?
i'm with dr. marrow's group .
i'm supposed to see mrs. dudley .
is she here?
what do you think?
why do you need so many chains?
that's a good question .
what is it about fences?
sometimes the people on either side of the fence see a locked chain , they feel a little more comfortable .
why do you suppose that is?
mrs. dudley?
hello?
mrs. dudley?
hello?
hello?
mrs. dudley?
oh , my
i'm i'm , uh i'm eleanor vance .
i'm here with the  dr. marrow's group .
you're the first .
yeah , i'd i'd heard a sound , and that's
it's make the dinner or answer the door .
can't do both .
are you mrs. dudley?
so far .
i'll show you your room .
this way .
the red room .
you're going to be the first visitors hill house has had ...
since mr. crain died .
really?
these are beautiful .
i know .
i've seen 'em .
it's a lot to dust .
i've never seen this kind of beauty .
you must love working here .
i set dinner on the dining room sideboard at six .
you can serve yourselves .
breakfast is ready at nine .
i don't wait on people .
i don't stay after dinner , not after it begins to get dark .
i leave ... before dark comes .
we live in town nine miles so there won't be anyone around if you need help .
we couldn't even hear you ... in the night .
why would we?
no one could .
no one lives any nearer than town .
no one will come any nearer than that ... in the night , in the dark .
you'll be staying in the north wing .
hi .
don't worry .
i'm not an obsessive packer .
it's just asking people to help me schlepp this stuff is a cheap ... and exploitative way of making new friends .
here .
i'm theo .
hi .
eleanor , but everyone calls me nell .
well , everyone calls me nell , don't you love it here?
i love it .
sort of charles foster kane meets the munsters or something .
i like your boots .
you do?
aren't they great?
prada .
milan , not new york .
but they're killing me .
hey , small price to pay for such savage kicks .
wow .
oh , my god .
oh , this is so twisted .
seriously twisted .
i set dinner on the dining room sideboard at six .
breakfast is at nine .
i don't stay after dinner , not after it begins to get dark .
i leave before dark comes , so there won't be anyone here if you need help .
we couldn't even hear you .
no one could .
no one lives any nearer than town .
no one will come any nearer than that .
in the night .
in the dark .
in the dark .
my bedroom's right next door to yours .
i think we share the same bathroom .
oh , don't worry .
i probably won't be in here much .
light sleeper .
that's why we're here .
what do you do , eleanor?
i'm between jobs right now .
the last person i was workin 'for , it ended .
over , so and you?
well , that depends .
i'm supposed to be an artist , but i've been distracted from work by love .
you know what i mean?
mmm , not really .
hey , don't tell me boston's different from new york .
oh , you mean you have trouble with commitment .
well , my boyfriend thinks so , my girlfriend doesn't .
if we could all live together but they hate each other .
hello .
the bag .
you know , it's hard when you're the only one at the party .
you know what i mean?
no .
a blank canvas .
i could paint your portrait directly on you .
or maybe not .
so , what about you?
husbands?
boyfriends?
girlfriends , eleanor?
where do you live?
mmm .
i don't have anyone .
but i do have a little apartment of my own .
it has a little flower garden .
you can just see the ocean .
and when the wind ... comes in just right , you can hear the buoys in the harbor .
wow .
that sounds really nice .
you're lucky .
but you know that , right?
oh , sorry .
just a little hair .
so , show me the bathroom !
oh , it's really beautiful .
it is huge .
oh , my god !
this is the bathroom .
look at this bathtub .
can you believe it?
look at that .
wow !
look at my bedroom , though .
isn't it beautiful?
yes .
you've got to see the great hall .
uh huh .
i mean , there's so much carving .
it's everywhere .
i know .
oh , look at this one .
isn't this one great?
no , that's creepy .
oh , and this one .
this one's weird .
well , you don't get this from the martha stewart catalog .
i don't like it .
isn't it based on the gates of hell by rodin?
well , it's not just hell .
see , the children , they're reaching for heaven , but their souls are trapped in purgatory .
and these are the demons ...
who can hold on to your soul for as long as they want .
did you study art?
no , i studied purgatory .
i was there once for 11 years .
it's when your soul is caught between the living and the dead .
oh , yeah , i've been there .
it's an 18 hour flight from l. a. to paris , and you're stuck in coach .
do you see?
well , let's not stand here .
come on .
okay .
whoa .
is it real?
no .
shall we go in?
yeah .
wow !
whoo !
wow !
wow !  [ humming ]  [ continues ]
it's beautiful !
oh ! [ humming continues ]
would you care to dance?
yes .
i'm starting to like this house !
this is great !
let's get outta here .
god !
we're like rats rats in a maze .
oh , god !
lf i ruin these boots
jesus , they cost me a fortune .
let's go back .
it's gotta be through here .
i'm sorry .
i'm sorry .
that's all right .
oh .
hey , i'm sorry .
i didn't mean to scare you .
i'm luke sanderson , just a bad sleeper .
basic tosser turner .
and you are?
nell vance .
what kind of sleeper?
nightmares?
not really .
anxiety attacks?
no .
uh uh .
okay .
obsessive indecision .
wow .
and you?
let me think .
you , i'm gonna guess , are a
don't even start .
wow , you're so dominant .
thanks .
theo .
hey , theo .
jesus .
here we are .
hey .
you're luke .
yup .
you're theo .
you're eleanor .
hi , i'm dr. marrow .
hi .
welcome .
hi .
hello , dr. marrow .
hi .
this is todd .
he's just come up .
greetings , fellow insomniac .
mary lambetta , my assistant .
so how was your drive , eleanor?
it was fine .
yeah .
good .
good .
welcome to hill house , everyone .
come on .
all right .
let the good times roll .
do you know what?
the rest of you may hate your insomnia , but i'm not sure i want a cure for mine .
that's when i get all my best ideas , when i'm waiting to fall asleep .
i'm alone , occasionally , with no distractions , my mind's racing with creative ideas , and come 3 : 00 a . m . , i feel like a genius .
are you kidding me?
3 : 00 a . m .
i start to feel ...
like i'm losing my mind , watching those infomercials on psychics ... or listening to tony robbins and the psychic hot lines .
have you ever seen that late night tv?
oh , yeah .
thank you .
i swear to god .
you get a steady diet of that crap , and pretty soon you start thinking about movin 'to montana ...
and becomin 'a survivalist .
that's why god created barbiturates , honey .
nembutal?
mm mm .
no , todd , i think we have a classic seconal woman on our hands .
in fact , i think i see a little jackie susann in theo .
ow .
all right , you two .
enough about pharmaceuticals .
so , look , what do we all need in life?
what are the basics?
food , water , shelter .
sex .
and sleep .
sleep .
i'm working on a five year study , with the help of mary here , making profiles of bad sleepers .
i'm looking for a common psychological link .
i hope that the work we do here will someday be able to help other people like yourselves .
god knows i'm all for helping people , saving the world , but doesn't everybody have a problem sleeping these days?
life's too frantic .
what about you , nell?
um , well , it seems that you all have trouble sleeping , because your lives are exciting , and it's complicated , and you think about it when you go to sleep .
but , um , i don't know .
nothing's ever really happened to me , so i don't have a reason to sleep badly .
but in your application you said you had trouble sleeping .
mm hmm , yes , but it's not like them .
it's because , uh , there was always somebody calling me , there was always somebody banging .
ever since i was little , i took care of my mother .
and and she would wake up in the middle of the night .
she would bang with her cane on the wall .
and it was just this relentless it was a relentless banging all through the night .
that's weird , because even though , uh , she's dead ,
i still hear it and i wake up .
well , that's why we're here , eleanor to try and help you .
yeah , nell .
i think what dr. marrow's trying to say is ... that you're a basket case , just like the rest of us .
thank you , mary .
okay .
okay .
why are we here?
what is wrong with you people?
these are standard cognitive and perception tests .
i'll be giving you a variety of these during the course of the week .
you are not in competition , so do not worry about being the head of the class , okay?
between all these tests , you'll have each other
todd and the house to keep you company .
luke .
eleanor .
but we can't go to town .
no .
and as you were told , there's no telephone service , there's no tv .
and the caretakers tend to lock the gate when they leave .
however ,
i do have my trusty cell telephone , in case of emergencies , okay?
and , um , what's the deal with the adams family mansion?
because , i gotta be honest ,
i don't get a real strong sleep vibe from this place .
no .
me too .
i wanted to make sure you didn't sleep too easily .
congratulations .
seriously , isolation is essential ... in the creation of an experimental model .
this house , who built it?
who lived here?
well , actually , that makes for a very good bedtime story .
once upon a time , there was a king who built a castle .
his name was hugh crain .
a hundred and thirty years ago , towns like concord and manchester were the center of american industry .
that's where crain made a fortune on the backs of workers in his textile mills .
now , this man could have anything he wanted , but what he wanted more than anything ... was a house filled with the laughter of children .
that's why there are all the carvings .
he married the most beautiful woman in town , called rene , and he built her this house , or at least some of it .
god , it sounds like a fairy tale or something .
but that's where the fairy tale ends .
hugh and rene would have no children .
they all died at birth .
then , a few years later , rene , she passed away , and crain became a total recluse .
but he kept on building , adding room upon room .
it's as if he was he was building a home for the family he would never have .
no one had seen crain for years .
but the townspeople said that sometimes at night ... they could hear sounds coming from the old house .
sounds of children .
so sad .
ooh !
jesus christ !
christ , i need a drink .
i think there's more to that story .
i can feel it .
i it's all around us .
it's in the ceiling .
it's in the walls .
it's in the furniture .
it's in this .
mary !
oh , jesus .
oh , no .
oh , jesus christ .
all right .
what happened?
let me see .
oh , my god !
keep your hand away from it .
don't touch it .
what were you doing?
this'll stop the blood from getting into her eye .
mary , we're going to get you to the hospital straightaway .
it's gonna be all right .
it's gonna be okay .
come on .
three steps .
please !
it's all right .
it's all right .
careful .
be careful .
here's the gate key to get back in .
you have my cell number .
call me the second you've spoken to a doctor .
all right , dr. marrow .
hey , i want you guys back as soon as possible .
okay , mary?
okay .
you'll be all right .
she almost lost her eye .
almost .
luke , there's something about the house , about hugh crain that i didn't say .
may i ask you not to tell the women?
yeah , yeah .
it's just i didn't want the tests disturbed .
okay , sure .
hey , you guys , wait up .
okay .
you guys wanna hear something really scary?
i just found this out .
turns out there's a darker chapter to the hugh crain fairy tale .
remember his lovely wife , rene?
well , rene , the town beauty , she didn't just die .
she killed herself .
really?
he just told you that?
yes .
and you can't say anything , 'cause he actually swore me to secrecy .
why did she kill herself?
well , there are the stillborn children , although i like to think it was more sinister ,
like maybe hugh crain was a horrible monster and drove her to it .
monster?
but he built this house for the woman that he loved ,
like the taj mahal .
the taj mahal wasn't a palace .
it was a tomb .
and equally overdone .
why didn't he tell us?
maybe he doesn't trust women .
yeah .
i think that's probably it .
i think he knew that your fragile , delicate sensibilities
after all , you know , i'm a man .
i can handle this kind of [ chuckles ]
how'd she kill herself?
he didn't say .
oh , and ladies , sleep tight .
jesus .
after dinner and the first bland history of hill house successfully relayed ,
miss vance appears most susceptible to suggestive history , evincing a strongly sentimental reaction to the love story component .
mr. sanderson , who tested at the bottom of the mogel reliability scale , was given the second part of the story .
when he passes the story on , the experimental haunting fiction ... should manifest itself within the group .
and dear mary almost lost an eye .
i like the way you comb your hair like that .
here .
this is for you .
for me?
yeah .
it's beautiful .
no , i'll i'll do it .
it's okay .
it's okay .
mm hmm .
looks good on you .
mm hmm .
you've been out of the world a long time , haven't you?
yeah .
well , the world's missed you .
happy tossing and turning .
eleanor .
now i lay me down to sleep .
i pray the lord my soul to keep .
if i should die before i wake ,
i pray the lord my soul to take .
god !
you scared the f  i'm sorry .
oh , you gotta be careful .
are you all right?
i'm sorry .
oh , no , no , no .
you just don't jump out
are you all right?
uh , yeah .
n n no .
oh !
what's with the , uh , glove?
what?
what's with the glove?
no , i couldn't sleep .
i was just insomnia .
what's with  ah , well [ mutters ]
yeah , you gotta be careful , 'cause l  i wasn't .
i was just
no , i know .
i'm sorry .
i just
oh !
um , interesting group , huh?
yeah , yeah , yeah .
it was good .
kind of i like theo .
she's ... quite an insomniac .
well , uh , listen , you should try and get some sleep , huh?
yeah , that's a good idea .
all right .
okay .
see you tomorrow .
all right .
there's some good hallways that way .
uh huh .
how's this one?
not bad .
good .
good .
see you tomorrow .
okay .
coming , mother .
i'm coming .
nell !
nell !
nell !
nell !
what is it?
i don't know .
where's it coming from?
it's everywhere .
oh , my god .
what's happening?
can you feel it , nell?
mm hmm .
the cold , can you feel it?
nell , can you feel it?
oh .
nell?
it's moving .
it's over .
it's over , right?
nell , come back here .
come back here !
no , it's in my room .
it's in my room .
you guys all right?
hey , is everything okay?
oh , god .
it's luke .
hey , is everything okay?
you guys all right?
luke !
oh , god .
what's going on?
did you hear it?
yeah , i just heard it .
i  w w was it part of the experiment?
was what part of the experiment?
the noise !
what did you hear?
theo , all i heard was you screaming ,
luke , help me , please .
i wasn't screaming for you .
it was in my room , and then it went into nell's room .
here , let me look .
are there any lights?
yes .
i don't i don't see anything .
i don't hear anything .
wow , i sort of got screwed on the old bedroom selection .
every room's , like , four times as big as mine .
is that it?
is that what you heard?
well , i did just take a bath .
i mean , could've been .
yeah , but then how do you explain the breath and the cold?
i don't know .
a draft .
maybe someone left a window open somewhere .
the cold , who felt it first?
oh , i think it was me .
what difference does it make?
well , eleanor , if it was you , did you say theo?
theo , if it was you , did you  look , i don't need anyone to tell me i'm cold .
let's blame it on the old plumbing then , huh?
what else could it be?
well , if you don't need me anymore , i guess that's it .
my job is done .
good night .
good night , luke .
yeah , me too .
yeah .
will you two be all right?
yeah .
you really didn't hear anything?
no .
eleanor .
eleanor .
find us , eleanor .
oh , eleanor .
find us .
okay .
these carvings are really creepy .
all these fat little cherubs and angels with furry animals .
it's really bizarre , i think .
i think they're the children hugh crain built the house for .
i don't buy that for a second that hugh crain was this lovable old tycoon ... with a soft spot for kids .
the guy was obviously running a sweatshop .
had children working 15 hours a day , and then he builds all this crap as propaganda .
it's like those teletubbies .
those things freak me out also .
and they sing , so they're actually even kind of scarier , if you think about it .
yeah .
how are you comin 'along?
i can't get this one .
what about you?
i did all right .
but that's another thing .
these tests .
it's like , why do we have to be here?
why do we have to be in this weird old house?
i like this house .
i think it's a beautiful house .
yeah , i guess .
i don't know .
i just think dr. marrow's up to something .
i'll tell you another thing .
i'm gonna get to the bottom of it , right after i check on theo , that is .
see how my old pal theo's doing .
doing or wearing?
yeah , no kidding .
did you see what she had on yesterday?
wow .
yeah , i definitely got a soft spot for theo .
nell , i'm gonna shut this door and give you a little privacy .
if there's anyone in there , we'll find him .
you just saw something move?
i saw something in the fireplace .
okay .
just relax .
i did .
i know i did .
you were here alone?
mm hmm .
yeah , luke had just left .
i didn't see anything , though .
luke , can you help me?
just ashes .
charred wood .
watch out .
let it go .
yep .
hello?
santa?
whoa !
jesus !
god !
god , are you all right?
yeah , i'm fine .
what is that?
a flue .
a what?
it's it's an old flue !
it opens up the chimney .
god !
is this what you saw?
no .
no , that's not what i saw .
mm mmm , that is not what i saw .
god .
hey , are you okay?
luke , are you okay?
what?
no , i'm not okay !
did you not see that thing?
it almost crushed me !
yeah , i saw it .
jeez , i was only asking !
that's what it was .
of course you were scared .
it scared the hell out of me too .
no , i know what i saw .
eleanor , this is a very confusing house .
you said it yourself .
nothing is what it seems .
look at me .
i'm not confused .
i saw something , and that wasn't it .
there was something in there .
hey , you guys should take a look at this .
welcome home , eleanor "?
oh , god .
what does that mean?
his face .
it's my name .
who did this?
who wrote this?
is this one of your sick jokes , luke?
what?
come on .
give me a little credit .
i think i have a better sense of humor than that .
do you really think i wrote that?
you found it .
you could have .
oh , with what?
with the 20 foot ladder that i keep in my back pocket?
m maybe you wrote it , theo !
you're the artist !
maybe this is your great idea of art !
don't be ridiculous .
i wanna know right now !
who wrote this?
did you write this , theo?
no !
of course not !
maybe it was you !
how dare you accuse me of writing this !
maybe you like being the center of attention !
what are you talking about?
let's stop this now .
come on .
who was it?
whoever wrote this , it's cruel .
you don't know me .
i didn't do it .
eleanor .
are you all right?
i know you think i did it , but i didn't .
look , people are always  no , i'm not making this stuff up .
i mean , i know you all think i'm crazy or doing this for attention .
i'm not .
for what it's worth , i believe you're a very sensitive woman , and i believe that people have taken advantage of you in the past .
mmm .
welcome home .
you'll never see it again .
mr. dudley's taking care of it .
come on .
there's something i want you to see .
oh , this is beautiful !
thought you'd like it .
well , i wonder what happened to him .
yeah , yeah .
oh , violets .
somebody must've died here .
well .
you know , all my life i've been waiting for an adventure , and i thought it would never happen to me .
adventures are for soldiers ... or for the women the bullfighters fall in love with .
and here i am .
paintings are calling out to me , strange noises in the night , and all it cost was five gallons of gas .
do you really think that someone's playing with you , eleanor?
yeah , it doesn't matter .
i can be a victim , or i can be a volunteer .
i'm gonna be a volunteer .
mm hmm .
eleanor .
eleanor !
eleanor , find us .
eleanor .
hmm?
eleanor , the ledger .
the ledger .
what?
it's crain's study .
concord .
oh , his textile mills .
man .
woman .
child .
child .
twelve years .
eleven years .
twelve years .
there's so many of them .
ten years .
twelve years .
they died so young .
eleven years .
what happened to you?
theo !
okay , okay .
theo !
yeah , what?
there's hundreds of them .
he kept records of everyone .
i was havin 'the best night's sleep of my life .
i swear .
the names , the dates and the ages .
the names they're crossed out .
it's dead children , theo .
can we talk about this in the morning?
they showed me .
they  [ sighs ]
oh , you're never gonna believe how i found them .
how'd you find them?
the blood led me to the bookcase .
the blood?
little footprints in blood .
nell , i'm worried about you .
theo , the house , it's trying to tell me something .
no .
you know what?
nell , you just gotta get some sleep , okay?
you've gotta sleep .
come on .
go to bed .
okay .
i'm listening .
dr. marrow?
dr. marrow?
dr. marrow?
dr. marrow?
eleanor vance continues ... her alienation of the other subjects .
it remains unclear what she saw in the fireplace ... and whether she truly believes she did not deface the painting .
interview with vance in greenhouse yesterday ... to ascertain the extent of her self delusion ... was inconclusive , due to subject's ... emotional instability .
well , i think i know how experiments work .
wait a second .
hold on .
hold on , theo .
what about all the noises , and the fireplace and the painting?
i think it's an old academic " bait and switch , " where  what? where you pretend that it's a study on insomnia , but what he's really interested in is seeing our reaction ...
to these phenomenons he's obviously behind .
no .
it's not dr. marrow .
oh , nell , i've been
are you all right?
god , i've been looking for you everywhere .
are you okay?
mm hmm .
it's not dr. marrow .
then who?
come on , nell .
if it's not dr. marrow
if you don't think this is really somehow part of the experiment , then why would you stay here another second?
'cause home is where the heart is .
oh , my god !
what is it?
oh , no .
what?
what , nell?
nell !
if it's not dr. marrow , that's a pretty scary proposition .
no , i'm not .
no , i'm not .
i'm not making this up !
no , i'm not .
i'm not , i know i'm
there is something there's something in here .
i can prove it .
i can prove i know i can .
oh , i know it is .
carolyn .
carolyn was his second wife .
eleanor , the fireplace .
where?
where are you?
where are you?
i'm here .
i hear you .
where?
that's where you are .
okay , i'll let you out .
i'll get you out .
i i will .
okay .
i'm gonna get you out .
i will .
i'll get you out .
don't worry .
what's that smell?
i'm trying .
i'm trying .
he killed them .
what?
he killed them .
the children from the mills .
it's just like you said .
he wanted to fill the house with the sounds of children .
he took them from his mills and he brought them here , but he wouldn't let them go .
he would never let them go .
and i found the skulls , just like carolyn did .
carolyn?
who's carolyn?
killed who , eleanor?
calm down , now .
and he had a second wife .
but he couldn't hide his secret .
you can never hide a secret .
carolyn found out what he'd done .
and now he wants me .
who?
who wants you?
and why?
she's delusional .
but what is happening to her?
she's in a fugue state .
let's get her to the sofa .
wanted to ... fill the house with children , but ...
get a blanket .
come on . he he turned into a monster .
it's okay , sweetheart .
it's okay .
no .
carolyn showed me in the photograph where she hid 'em .
and they're all locked together in there .
he won't let them go .
eleanor , listen to me .
listen to me .
listen to me .
it's not true .
he's still here .
hugh crain is still in the house .
no .
yeah .
i mean , what if she's right?
what if she's right?
what are you sayin ', theo?
it doesn't do any good to talk about
stop .
stop !
stop !
what if she's right?
now , listen to me , all of you .
let me explain what's happening .
you're participating in a study on group fear and hysteria .
what?
that's why you brought us here?
that's what this is all about?
you brought us here to scare us?
is that it?
yes .
you're just waiting for her to have a total nervous breakdown before you said anything?
no !
what is your problem?
i gave you the clues .
you created the story as you were meant to .
but it's over .
i'm pulling the plug .
oh , that
none of this is real .
no , it is real .
eleanor , it's not real .
no !
you have to look at the bones in the fireplace !
it's not real !
and then i saw i saw his wife , hanging in the greenhouse !
i know i saw it !
i'm sorry .
i'm sorry .
i'm sorry i brought you here , all of you .
the dudleys will be here in the morning , and then we can all go home at once .
no !
i can't believe you're not gonna look .
okay , that's enough .
i'm taking her upstairs .
i think you've done enough .
i'll help you .
because it was a controlled experiment .
a controlled experiment?
she's in total shock !
you can't do that !
i told you , it wasn't meant to be like this .
oh , come on .
you don't care about us .
you don't care about insomnia .
you just wanted to scare the hell out of us so we'd fit into your little test ...
or model or whatever bullshit you need to understand this !
oh , please !
okay !
you can't do it !
now , listen !
you listen .
i am trying to help people .
my field of study is the science of fear .
i try to understand why people act the way they act , why they feel the way they feel
you don't feel .
where are you going?
i'm gonna find out what eleanor was talking about .
what am i doing?
good night .
be right back .
i'll get you some tea .
oh , god , it's looking for me .
who was holding my hand?
no .

eleanor , look at me .
i need you to climb over and step back on the platform .

hey , i think i'm gonna take her to see a doctor , right now .
i think i'm gonna take her to see a real doctor .
we'll take her to the hospital in the morning .
the gate's still locked .
we have to wait until the dudleys arrive .
what?
that's real compassionate .
yeah , let's wait until the morning , and then maybe tonight you'll have a chance to scribble a few more ...
" welcome home , eleanor's on the wall .
i didn't write that , okay?
you'd never write that .
that wouldn't be ethical , would it?
will you guys just shut up?
come on !
somebody's gonna have to stay with her tonight .
we can't leave her alone .
all right , i'll take the first watch .
okay .
the , uh , environment is proving entirely successful ... in promoting shared hysteria reactions .
the group is manifesting manifesting classic pathologies of trauma and
i should have stopped this when mary got hurt , and definitely when eleanor was
jesus , i need to get them out of here .
