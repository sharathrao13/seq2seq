it's a throwaway , billy .

lf i see you wince even one time

it hurt my feeling .

he's in the bathroom back there .
mr. wheeler .
good mornin ', billy .
got a minute?
yeah , sure .
not easy to get up here .
they treat me right .
they didn't have you on the register .
i can't remember all your names .
price of fame , huh?
can i get you something?
no .
let's just sit .
it's been a rough season .
always next year .
not for me .
it's one of those secrets everybody knows .
what you don't know is it's official .
billy , i sold the tigers .
well , that's ... great .
ls it?
you've been the heart and soul of this team .
like family .
all the negotiations , the bastards never said a word .
said what?
they wanna trade you to the giants .
wow .
ls that why you're here?
no .
i don't know how to say this .
you know , i've been watching you for 18 years .
nothin '
nothin 'has given me more pleasure .
you're like the old boys .
they were golden .
they had that special pride .
when they were done , they were done .
nobody had to show them the door .
are you saying i should retire?
why not?
it wouldn't hurt the negotiations , and it'd serve those sons of bitches right .
i don't know .
i don't know what to say .
well , you can't tell me you haven't thought about it .
and you've been smart with money , right?
right?
i've always been a tiger .
i know , son .
that's why this is killin 'me .
you know , my dad bought this team when i was seven .
i grew up watching the tigers .
i was gonna leave the team to my kids , but they don't even like baseball .
everything's changed , billy .
the players , the fans , tv rights and arbitrations .
it isn't the same .
the game stinks , and l
i can't be a part of it anymore .
billy , you want me to
hello?
jane .
where are you?
you're downstairs?
just stay where you're at .
i'm on my way down .
what do you want me to tell 'em?
i need more time .
the game doesn't stink , mr. wheeler .
it's a great game .
billy , what's up?
i tried to get her in a cab , mr. chapel ... but she said she wanted to just go up and walk in central park .
go easy on our boys today , billy .
jane , why didn't you wait?
are you crying?
what's the matter?
they didn't have any kleenex in the hotel bathroom .
what's goin 'on , jane?
i've been sitting in the lobby for the last two hours .
doin 'what?
i'm sorry i didn't call last night .
i could tell that your voice was worried
lf something's wrong , just say it , jane .
i mean , we don't
we never had to fake it .
i'm leaving .
i'm going to london .
london?
there's a job .
a good job .
an editor's position .
and i've been trying to figure out a way to tell you ... but everything sounds so
what can i say?
tell me what to say .
i can't tell you , billy .
it's all right .
i knew it ... the day i met you five years ago .
you knew what?
you don't need me .
you and the ball and the diamond , you're perfect ... a perfectly beautiful thing .
you can win or lose the game all by yourself .
i'm sorry .
i'm so sorry .
have dinner tonight with me after the game .
we'll go to mario's .
i have a 6 : 00 plane .
they wanted me there a week ago when you called , and i wanted to see you .
i wanted to say good bye .
good bye , billy .
welcome to new york and to yankee stadium ... on a crisp and glorious fall afternoon ... where the yankees try to win the divisional title against the tigers .
hi , everybody .
i'm vin scully , along with steve lyons ... and welcome to our final telecast of the regular season .
you can smell the fall .
the world series is just around the corner .
mr. chapel?
ken strout .
i was your bat boy a long time ago .
my dad was a tiger .
joe strout .
i remember .
how's he doin '?
good .
he and ma are livin 'in florida .
he doesn't move around too easy , though .
he's got bad knees .
you know , a little arthritis .
you playin 'today?
don't think so .
they just called me up .
good .
well , good luck to you .
you give your dad my best .
he was a great player .
oh , thanks .
i'll tell him .
live from yankee stadium in new york , it's new york yankees baseball .
today , on the next to the last day of the year ... the yankees have a chance to clinch the pennant .
to do it , they'll have to beat billy chapel and the detroit tigers .
excuse me .
good afternoon , everyone .
excuse me .
could you turn that off , please?
the yankees are set to clinch it .
no .
but standing in their way is the great veteran right hander of the tigers ...
billy chapel .
does anybody else know?
nobody knows nothin '.
not even perry .
lf they knew , that's all they'd be talkin 'about .
what does jane say?
jane's movin 'to london .
movin 'to london?
what the
how are you gonna manage that?
we're not .
this ain't your day .
what are you gonna do?
i don't know .
that's wheeler's nephew .
he sent him down to get your answer .
guess he's gonna sit through the whole game if he has to .
poor kid .
he doesn't even know what he's doin 'here .
throw the ball to the glove , son .
just play catch .
since you're throwin 'bullets , i won't mention that you were an hour late ... and i've been tryin 'to figure out who my pitcher would be if you didn't show .
have i ever not showed?
i mean , in 19 years have i ever not showed?
that's true of everyone till the first time they don't show .
billy , i had an idea .
i've pretty much made up my mind , but i wanted to run it by you first .
i want jimmy to catch today .
i know how you feel about gus , but he ain't hittin '.
he ain't hit for a while now .
i haven't said anything , but we need the left handed bat .
i want gus .
i know .
and i'd love to take one of these goddamn games .
we're not layin 'down .
we're not gonna be a red carpet to the series for them .
gus catches or i don't pitch .
me and gus .
nobody else .
i hope you hear me .
are you tellin 'me how to run this team?
no .
but today it's me and gus .
i've never asked you any other time , okay?
good .
glad you agree .
can't argue about this right now .
gotta warm up .
i'm sorry .
we have a bit of a delay .
we're correcting a bit of a maintenance problem .
so we don't have a bit of a crash?
ls there someplace i can stay?
the premiere lounge is down there on your right .
thanks .
when the sun goes down , it'll be an easier time to hit for both teams .
talkin 'about shadows and sunlight ... that might very well sum up billy chapel .
long has he stood in the brilliant sunshine ... in his great 19 year career ... but now , battling back from an eight and eleven record this year ... tryin 'to find his way out of the shadows back into the sunlight .
he'll be facing mike robinson , followed by jonathan warble ... and then sam tuttle .
bottom of the first inning , no score , and the yankees comin 'up .
what's he lookin 'at?
he's lookin '... at the clouds .
you okay , chap?
you okay?
catching , number 27 , gus sinski .
number 27 .
at shortstop , number seven
tryin 'to take my hand off?
sorry .
just let me set for that juice .
warn me or somethin '.
i'm gonna throw a little harder than usual today .
there's your warnin '.
chap , don't throw it away too early .
today i'm throwin 'hard .
you and me?
one more time?
why not?
we got you , chapel !
you're done !
we're gonna stick a fork in you !
you are finished !
get off the plate !
the tigers are done !
you're done !
you're finished !
i can always tell when i'm in new york .
chapel !
yo , chapel !
you suck !
you stink on ice !
you couldn't pitch a tent !
clear the mechanism .
hello , mike .
strike one !
chapel working on robinson .
bottom of the first inning , no score .
and there's a little looper to jose garcia .
one away .
this is my lucky day .
how are ya?
fine .
what'll you have?
the bud on the tap is good .
this is a beautiful day for the big ballpark in the bronx .
two solid years , and now a third with the yankees .
good breaking ball .
a lot of guys would be upset about missin 'their flight delay this and that but this works out beautiful for me .
chapel trying to derail the yankees ... and the yankees trying to end a season ... that has long been finished for detroit .
they pushed this guy up to pitch this game ... so basically we clinch today and i get to see it .
beautiful .
what can i get for you?
chivas and water .
here we go .
everything is
look at that .
ah , it's early .
you got nuts , chips?
got those pretzels .
i can make do .
thank you .
good fastball with some movement on it .
jesus , he swung at that?
this guy's got nothin 'now .
lf i was boston , i'd be worried .
what , are they throwin 'the game?
this guy used to be a monster .
when he first came up , unhittable .
now he's a junker . ... three years in a row .
there's no love lost between these two .
they don't like each other too much .
at third base , number 13 , sam tuttle .
sam tuttle .
i can't think of a better reason not to be a yankee .
sam tuttle hit . 625 .
he went five for eight against chapel this year .
that would make me not like a guy .
i would think so .
fastball on the inside corner .
strike one .
wasn't that inside?
never do swing at the first pitch , do you , sam?
no .
we're off the page now , gus .
this is between me and ugly .
straight heat .
that a boy .
strike two !
that shit's outside .
no wonder nobody likes you .
everything's a goddamn debate .
fastball , and it runs right on that outside corner .
so 0 and 2 the count to sam tuttle .
i saw that shitty little hollywood movie you did .
ball !
sinski wanted that one .
so did chap .
you see the reaction on his face .
that's a good pitch on the outside corner .
tuttle didn't like the first two calls , and now he gets a break on that one .
that's not the kind of pitch that chapel's gonna like ... being called a ball all day long .
don't crowd me , sam .
i hate being crowded .
one and two the count , and whoops , tuttle has moved up on the plate .
he's all over the plate now .
now you got the idea .
down goes tuttle .
what a knockdown pitch that was .
there's a message being delivered .
yankee stadium is like a schoolyard ... and bill murdie looks like a teacher who sees trouble .
they say in every great athlete there's a mean streak ... and billy chapel's no different .
bill murdie goes from umpire to referee .
any time i played against this guy , if he felt like he had his good stuff ... he'd flip you like this , throw a ball right up over your head ... just to let you know , " i can throw the ball anywhere i want .
you know , i've been a yankee fan since 1958 .
i can name a yankee for every number .
oh , god .
please don't .
billy martin , bobby richardson .
frank " the crow " crosetti and bobby murcer .
three , the babe .
gehrig .
dimaggio .
six  excuse me .
steve boyer , roy white .
would you mind?
you can't smoke in a bar .
what , now you can't talk in a bar?
this ain't church , lady .
tuttle back up to the plate .
two and two !
same shit , different day , huh?
i'd throw it at you again , but i'm afraid murdie'd run me .
strike three !
good breaking ball .
got him looking .
great job settin 'up the hitter .
let's take another look .
tuttle looks like a deer caught in the headlights .
chapel jelly legged him .
so at the end of one , tigers nothing , yankees nothing .
here we go now .
four , five , six .
let's get somethin 'started .
jose , atta baby .
guys , it's all about positioning .
you gotta wait on this guy .
mike , can i have some water?
sure thing , billy .
you all right?
you got it goin 'good out there .
make sure you save somethin '.
birch wants to play golf tomorrow .
you know , i played golf with birch the day i met jane .
you doin 'all right?
i'm not hearin ''em at all out there .
yeah , that'll fix it .
i don't need any help .
i can see that .
i can see you got your car kicked completely into submission .
just go away .
i can always tell when i'm in new york .
do you really know anything about cars?
want me to have a look at it?
it's not mine .
it's just a trashy rental .
yeah .
mine too .
try the key , see if we can't get it started .
i should've paid attention in auto shop .
what did you do?
well , i was
i have no idea .
i don't
i don't know anything about cars .
i was just tryin 'to be manly .
that was great .
you saved my day .
'course i did .
i said i would .
where you headed?
i'm not sure .
bear mountain , maybe .
i just threw my stuff in and took off .
had to get out of the city .
how come?
'cause summer's over and i missed it .
i work all the time , makes me feel old .
i don't know .
well , thanks again .
what's the problem?
my problem seems to be solved .
oh , no .
wait a sec .
the car's fine .
listen , honey .
i gave up on four calls hauling my ass out to you .
that's a hundred bucks to me , so if nothin's wrong with this car now ... there will be when i bring it down to the city .
everything all right?
everything's peaches , mac .
you're billy chapel .
it's a pleasure to meet you .
i can't believe this .
oh , i'm sorry .
you are the greatest freakin 'ballplayer out there .
i'm sorry .
but you really are .
i'm gonna go get that .
you stay right here , okay?
billy chapel .
nice to meet you .
jane aubrey .
you know , i got this problem .
see , i'd like to keep talkin 'with you ... but i gotta go to work .
just a sec .
i'll get there when i get there .
can you do me a favor?
anything .
we got a bum deal on this rental here , so if you could
lf you could haul this back to town for us , i'd really appreciate it .
i can't take that .
wait a second .
what are you doing?
you like baseball?
what?
baseball .
no , not really .
you ever been?
no .
would you like to go?
would you like to go to a baseball game with me?
lf she don't wanna go , i'll go .
don't let that happen .
lady , you can't just stand in the middle like that .
oh , sorry .
let me see your ticket .
oh , you're with the players 'wives .
follow me .
thanks .
excuse me .
sorry .
who are you here with , honey?
billy chapel .
oh , how nice .
this week's blonde .
no , stay .
you're cool .
trust me .
i've been there .
i'm kisha birch .
hi .
jane aubrey .
nice to meet you .
strike three !
you got a ball?
yeah .
you don't lose much , do you?
i lose .
i've lost .
about 134 times .
that's over , like , 15 years , okay?
you count them?
we count everything in baseball .
i mean , god , that's all we do .
all right , quit stallin '.
what?
you haven't told me anything about you .
nothin '.
well , i figured if i kept my mouth shut ...
i could pass for elegant and mysterious .
you're forgetting i saw you on the highway ... kicking the hell out of your car .
where are you from?
oh , god .
three questions .
syracuse , new york .
that's one .
what are the pads for?
this one is my article on lip gloss for elle magazine ... this one is on skin peels , and my grocery list .
last question .
how do you like to be kissed?
you know , i've always thought ... that men and women should just carry around signs .
lf you're poor and you can't afford it ... you would make yours out of cardboard and string .
and if you're rich , you could have it lettered in gold leaf ... pounded out of tin my mexican craftsmen .
it doesn't matter , but you wear them around your neck , see?
and they say things like " shallow " or " horny .
it just would be a hell of a lot easier .
what would yours say?
lsn't this your floor?
i think so .
we've been here twice before .
good morning .
gotta go .
sleep as long as you want .
you can take a shower , anything you want .
nobody'll bother you till you take the sign off the door .
okay .
thanks .
what's this?
a souvenir?
it's my number .
you don't have to give me this .
i know i don't have to do this , but ...
i wanted to .
when will you be back?
i already checked .
four weeks from thursday i'll be back in new york , so ... that thursday night ... meet me in the bar downstairs at 10 : 00 , okay?
i'll be there waitin 'for you .
lf you don't show up , if you leave me standing in that bar , it'll ruin this .
well , then i guess i'll just have to show up .
i'm serious .
i'll be there , jane , okay?
okay , billy chapel .
birch , baby !
kiss that bitch good bye !
take it over !
clear the mechanism .
you look old , davis .
are we that old?
and the fastball sinks at the knees , and the count oh and one .
don't smile at me , davis .
i hate that .
it was a sad day in detroit when gary wheeler ... the owner of the tigers and a somewhat beleaguered franchise ... was forced to trade davis birch , who was a free agent .
detroit could not come up with his monetary demands .
the yankees were waiting with open arms and an open wallet .
it was your team too .
how much money we gotta make?
you wanna see my team?
that's my team over there .
you got it .
i'll be out in a second , okay?
billy , are you gonna just sit there and mope or are you gonna help?
i ain't carryin 'no books .
where's the pillows?
you're the best , kiddo .
the best around .
a worthy opponent .
the oh one pitch , and the bottom just drops out of it .
strike two .
look at birch starin 'out at chapel sayin '...
where's that curve ball comin 'from?
he never had that before .
it don't happen that often , but i got you mixed up , don't l?
you're guessin 'now , aren't you?
well , here's your fastball , right down the pipe ... just so you don't walk away thinkin 'i was afraid to give it to you .
strike !
fastball runs on the inside corner .
strike three called .
i could've hit that .
so billy chapel all business , taking care of birch on three pitches .
kenny howell will follow .
lf you don't show up , if you leave me standing in that bar ... it'll ruin this .
cab , mr. chapel?
you leaving?
i was supposed to meet someone , but they
i'm sorry .
i wasn't gonna come .
i sat in my apartment counting the hours ... to the time when i was not gonna show up to meet you , and then i just
oh , god .
why do you always use both my names?
so i know what i'm up against .
i had a great time with you last month .
it's not that .
don't get me wrong .
it's just that
i don't mean to sound like anything or anything ... but but
i don't do that .
i'm not saying anything about it .
what?
i just don't do it , not since college .
what don't you do?
i think i should go home .
why?
because i just don't screw like that !
and and and i hate that word .
you want the cab , mr. chapel?
give it to somebody else .
i don't go to hotel rooms with men i don't know .
i can't be a groupie .
you're not a groupie .
you don't look like one or act like one .
i didn't treat you like one .
wasn't i a gentleman?
yes , i know .
but you pull up out of nowhere , you start my car ... you make me laugh , and the next thing i know ...
i'm at a baseball game that you win !
i mean , it's so surreal .
little boys buy cards with your picture on them .
they buy those for the gum .
goddamn it !
what?
goddamn what?
i like you .
so what's the problem?
i'm really not at all the person you think i am .
and i think it would just be more fair for both of us for me to just leave .
well , forget it .
what's the difference?
i mean what?
give me the thing .
what's the difference between the real you ... and this other you?
the real me is
the real me is plain , uninteresting ... and hates sexy underwear because it's really uncomfortable .
so the real you's a bummer .
this can't be what you were looking for from this evening .
be totally honest with me .
that day i fixed your car , i got lucky .
maybe you got lucky too .
i mean ...
i know we don't know each other so well ... but that's what i was hopin '.
i mean , we don't have to we could like
like walk , i mean we could walk .
we could just walk .
walk?
i could walk .
i mean , we don't have to talk so much either .
border collies .
my dad loved the blue heelers .
ls he still alive?
no , they're both gone .
him first , and then her within a year .
he was a good man .
very tall .
very reserved .
passionately in love with two things : my mother and baseball .
then he was a lucky man .
so , how do we do this?
how does this work , billy?
i told you , i have to be here next month for a couple of days .
i wanna see you .
okay .
so ... when you're away ...
i'll live my life and you'll live yours .
and none of this stupid , bullshit , why didn't you call me crap .
and what you do when you're not with me ... has nothing to do with me , and vice versa .
no questions asked .
no worrying .
no obsessing .
that sounded perfect .
good night .
my back keeps breakin 'out .
candy says it's gross .
use the loofah .
the what?
the loofah .
it exfoliates .
you're losin 'it over this girl .
i met this woman in new york .
i'm thinking of askin 'her down .
call her .
no , it's not
it's casual .
i've seen her a few times over the winter in new york ... when i happened to be there .
call her .
hello?
i'm havin 'this problem ... with my skin peel .
i was just thinkin 'about you .
what were you thinkin '?
i was wondering when you play your first series against the yankees .
come down here .
what?
come spend the weekend .
meet my friends .
i don't know , billy .
what do you mean , you don't know?
i've got a ton of work to do , and i can't afford to be running off
so i'll pay .
no .
it's not that .
we made the rules .
i think we should stick to them .
there's no rules about havin 'fun .
that's bullshit .
why is it bullshit?
because if all you wanna do is have fun , then you would come down here ...
'cause this is fun .
you know who sat in the bleachers last sunday?
who?
sandy koufax .
you are such  sandy koufax .
you are like the ultimate guy .
you don't like guys?
i need a regular guy , not the guy on the old spice commercial .
it was right guard .
what?
it was right guard , that commercial .
i was being metaphorical , billy .
look , this is crazy .
what am i supposed to do?
i'm supposed to run down there and meet sandy koufax ... get his autograph and sleep with mr. right guard?
what are you so afraid of?
i'm not afraid .
i can't be a groupie .
you know , that's the second time you used that word to me , jane ... and it didn't really go down that well the first time .
now you're mad .
no , i'm not mad .
i'm just ... pissed off .
that's not fair .
i'm gonna hang up now .
let's start from the beginning .
i'll come some other time .
no .
when will you call me?
like when i don't feel like killin 'you .
told her .
so .
we haven't seen you around much lately .
i've been working hard .
yeah , well , all work and no play
all i've got is my toothbrush and a bathing suit i bought at the airport .
you're not smiling .
you're annoyed .
i'm an idiot .
no , i'm an idiot .
jane , listen to me .
no matter what happens in the next five minutes ...
i want you to know that when i opened this door ...
i was so happy to see you that my heart leapt .
it leapt in my chest .
okay?
okay .
hey , billy , can i borrow your ... blow dryer?
don't go .
it's not your
i have terrible timing .
i've always had it .
that's why i failed at acting and skiing and table tennis .
i should have known when the only flight to lauderdale was at 6 : 10 a . m .... and the only rental car i could get was this ridiculous lincoln .
your car the car is perfect .
it's perfect .
that girl
no , please .
you don't have to do this .
i'm not angry or hurt .
i'm not we're not anything .
you're fine .
you can do whatever you want .
i know i can do what
i just i don't want her .
then what is she doing here?
well , i like her .
she's my masseuse .
it's never quite how you play it in your head .
what about the whole deal thing?
what deal?
you know , you do what you do , i do what i do .
you believed that?
i was lying .
i was trying to be the man .
and i was doing a damn good job of it until you invited me down here .
you were right .
i was afraid .
i was afraid you were gonna break my heart into a thousand pieces .
jane , i'm sorry .
i'm
i've been thinking about you , jane .
i don't know what i was that was a
but all right , tell me what i can say so you'll believe me .
i believe you .
well , then stay .
please , jane .
i want you to stay .
this can only end bloody for me , billy .
i saved the sign .
you know the " yes " sign?
i pinned it on the wall in my locker .
goddamn it !
it was stupid !
strike three called .
on the corner .
strike !
fastball , got him lookin '.
that's strikeout number five for billy chapel ... and he is really on a roll now .
franklin , obviously annoyed at what he thinks is a bad call ... is muttering as he goes up the first base line .
bill murdie showing some patience , but right back at him , ready to bite .
here's that pitch again .
it certainly looked like it was in the heart of the strike zone ... so it's a little surprising that franklin was so annoyed .
and it looks like for bill murdie , the pot is about ready to boil over .
so , a dominant inning for billy chapel , striking out the side .
you're in the zone .
number 24 .
feels good .
so here's mickey hart , oh for one .
no score , fourth inning .
jack spellman doing well .
has allowed only two hits to the tigers ... and meanwhile , billy chapel in perfect control .
mickey'll be gone next year too .
poor guy .
never could get a break .
where was that catch he missed?
the one that hit him?
they still play that on diamond vision all the time , you know
oops , there goes another rubber tree plant
fenway .
everything's all right , man .
guess that looked pretty funny out there today , huh?
probably end up on espn or something .
lot of shit ends up on espn i don't think is very funny , mick .
phone call , mr. chapel .
there's a bunch of cameras out there , waiting to make a joke of this .
so you can either stop , give 'em the sound bite , do the dance ... or you can hold your head up and walk by , and the next time we're in boston ... we'll go out there and we'll work the wall together .
don't help 'em make a joke out of you .
old school , baby .
he's right .
chapel .
it's jane .
i got your number from the front office .
i hope that it's okay .
no , that's all right .
don't worry about it .
what's wrong?
something's happened .
it's my daughter .
she ran away .
your daughter?
i'll tell you .
i don't have time now .
but she's there in boston .
her father lives there .
oh , god .
we had a fight and she  all right .
jane , just slow down , all right?
just slow down .
she climbed down the fire escape and went to penn station ... and got on a train to go to her father , but he's not there .
what's the address?
8245 clackton .
what what's her name?
freedom .
scared you , didn't l?
heather .
it's heather .
it's okay .
i'm
i'm the guy your mom said was was comin 'to get you .
let's get out of here before we get our asses kicked twice in one night .
you're heather .
and you're the baseball player .
my mom can do nothing normal .
shut up .
shut up .
do you want something?
i'll have a v8 .
what is it with single men and v8 juice?
i mean , my dad's fridge has nothing but mustard in it ... but when i come to visit , it has mustard ... fish sticks , and this big jug of v8 juice .
like , if he makes me choke down a glass , he's being healthy and fatherly .
well , i like v8 .
it's , uh ... nutritious .
so , are you my mom's boyfriend?
i'm not sure .
but you've slept with her .
v8 .
it's a refreshing blend of eight ... vegetable juices .
what did you and your mother fight about?
i didn't come home from school when i was supposed to ... because i was with mark elton ... and she freaked out because , you know ... he has facial hair and his parents are never home .
and i said , " we didn't do anything .
and she said , " you could have .
and i said , " well , i might love him .
and she said , " well , you don't know what love is .
and i said , " well , i'm gonna do what i want to do .
and she said , " not in this house .
and ... so i went to my dad's because ... he doesn't care what i do ... 'cause he's stoned 90 percent of the time .
she just
she doesn't ... want me to make the same mistakes that she did .
i mean , she had me when she was 16 .
you know , she never had ... a love story .
and now it's like she doesn't believe in it .
oh , honey , i'm so sorry .
i'm sorry too .
i'm so sorry .
thank you .
come up .
don't ever do that again , okay?
okay .
we can always work it out , all right?
okay .
okay , thanks .
just talk to me .
honey , you want some spaghetti?
no , it's okay .
i'm tired .
you sure?
yeah .
i ate on the plane .
how was it?
it was good .
it was really small .
she's already asleep .
thank you .
why didn't you tell me?
i don't know .
i protect her , maybe too much .
some guys meet her and they don't come around any more .
she thinks it's her fault .
you want some tea or something?
i could make
you hungry?
no , i'm i'm good .
it's
it's nice .
it's ...
a good home .
thanks .
i like to hold it in my hand ...
'cause i know somewhere you're doing the same thing .
i'm glad you called me .
i'm really glad .
what are you doing down there?
my foot's been kicking something down here all night .
what is
it's not mine .
oh , you mean it doubles as a flashlight?
it's really a flashlight .
i was wondering why ...
there were so many batteries in here .
oh , shut up .
i'm hungry .
i'm starving .
to the kitchen . ... about 20 hours of labor .
nicky was so freaked out , he didn't even stick around for my sixth month .
but there was this unbelievable nurse who stayed double shift ... to be with me and feed me ice chips ... and tell me when to breathe and push and scream ... and then finally ... she came out .
and they laid her on my stomach , and i could feel her little heartbeat ... and i just kept thinking , over and over ...
you and me .
you and me , little girl .
and then i rigged out my backpack ...
like those baby slings they have now ... and we walked out of there ... two kids together .
what are you thinking?
that you're heroic , and i admire you .
and you care a lot about me ... but you can't afford to get involved .
ls that what's next?
i was thinking about you and heather .
and me .
i was really thinking about ... how nice it would be to spend time together .
