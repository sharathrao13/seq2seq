well , thanks for finally seeing me .
they tell me you don't want to eat .
i'm not hungry .
jack , jesus didn't come to free us from pain .
he came to give us the strength to bear it .
maybe he wanted this pain for me .
<i>no , he had nothing to do with this .
it was an accident . </ i>
no , it wasn't an accident .
jesus chose me for this .
jack , ask for the mercy ofjesus christ .
if it was an accident , why do i have to ask for his mercy?
i will have mercy on whom i will have mercy .
i will have compassion on whom i will have compassion .
don't be so prideful .
