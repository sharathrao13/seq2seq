look over here .
he's marking himself .
what?
ancient warriors would mark themselves with the blood of their kill .
it's a rite of passage .
this is starting to make sense .
the hieroglyphs are a little difficult to make out .
but the story is all here .
thousands of years ago , these hunters found a backwater planet .
they taught humans how to build and were worshipped as gods .
every hundred years the gods would return .
and when they did , they would expect a sacrifice .
humans were used to breed the ultimate prey .
the hunters would battle with these great serpents to prove themselves worthy to carry the mark .
but if the hunters lost , they made sure nothing survived .
an entire civilization wiped out overnight .
so ... the humanoids , the hunters they brought those creatures here to hunt?
and they use us like cattle .
we're hosts for them to breed in .
the heat bloom was the sign to lure us down here .
this whole thing was a trap .
without us , there could be no hunt .
shit !
verheiden !
oh , shit .
when that door opens , we're dead .
not if we set things right .
what do you mean?
this pyramid is like a prison .
we took the guards 'guns , and now the prisoners are running free .
to restore order , the guards need their guns .
when that door opens , we're gonna give that thing his gun back .
are you crazy?
during a big game hunt , the animals being hunted don't arm the hunters .
they're not hunting us .
we're in the middle of a war .
it's time to pick a side .
we are on our side .
we have to consider the possibility that we might not make it out of here .
but we have to make sure those serpents don't reach the surface .
because if they do , everything everywhere could die .
the enemy of my enemy ... is my friend .
let's go find our friend .
how do you say " scared shitless " in italian?
non vedo i'ora di uscire con te da questa piramide perch mi sto cagando addosso .
more or less .
move !
lex .
lex .
hold on .
come on , lex .
oh , no .
wait .
wait .
please , wait .
the enemy of my enemy is my friend .
the enemy of my enemy is my friend .
i'm coming with you .
you hear me , you ugly creature?
what are you doing?
miller !
miller !
sebastian .
help me , lex .
i'm gonna get you out of there .
it's too late .
it's inside me .
i'm gonna get you outta here .
you can't ...
no !
no .
no .
no !
no !
i have to help him .
lex !
they mustn't reach the surface .
they mustn't reach the surface .
i know .
do it !
i'm sorry .
i'm sorry .
it's a bomb .
well , i hope it kills every fucking one of 'em .
you are one ugly mother ...
