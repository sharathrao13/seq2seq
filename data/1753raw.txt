now , children .
are you sitting comfortably?
then i will begin .
this story started many thousand of years ago .
but it was all over in just 7 days .
all that long long time ago , none of the things we can see now .
the sun , the moon , the stars , the earth , animals and plants .
not a single one existed .
only god existed .
so only he could create .
and he did .
i imagine he has dead like all the rest .
ahh ... those were the days ...
mr toltle your hair .
yes?
good morning , madam .
we've come about to ...
oh yes , of course ...
come in .
i wasn't expecting you were so soon .
you are ...?
i am bother smiths , madam .
and this is admond toltle .
please to meet you madam .
you must be the gardener .
that's right , the gardener .
and this young lady called lydia .
does she has must experiences in service?
don't let her angle face fool you , madam .
she is older than she looks .
can you iron?
what's the matter?
the cat got no tongue?
she can't talk , madam poor little mice of mute .
but she is good little worker , i can promise you that .
alright , the other girl i hadn't spoke to her much anyway .
follow me , mrs. smiths , you and the girl sleep at upstairs .
and you ...
mr.?
toltle , madam .
yes , toltle . you can sleep in the shed around the back .
this house has been neglected since servants disappeared almost a week ago .
you mean they just vanished?
yep .
they didn't collect the wages .
they just left then
what a strange thing to do !
this house is not an ideal home .
as in my advertisement requesting ... honest , hardworking people .
there's nobody more hardworking than us , isn't that right , mr. toltle?
well , i will be honest ... and very hardworking .
the kitchen . l have breakfast at eight .
the children at nine .
lunch is set at one , and dinner at half past seven .
the master , madam?
the master was killed in the war .
a year and a half ago .
which of you does the cooking?
i am so sorry , madam .
which of you does the cooking?
you will notice what i'm doin '.
ln this house , no door must be open without previous one being closed first .
it is vital that you remember this .
it's not as easy as it may seen .
there are 15 different keys for of the 50 doors .
mrs. smiths ... from tomorrow onwards , i'll leaving the keys and you're in charge .
yes . madam .
the music room , that old piano was already here when we moved in .
please do not let the children thumb on it .
it set off my migraine .
silence is something that we pride very highly in this house .
you'll not find a telephone , a radio or anything that makes a sound .
we don't have electricity either .
during the war , the german kept cutting it off ... so we just learn without it .
let's continue ...
that's no need to show us around the whole house .
yes !
yes , there is .
cause here , most of the time you can hardly see your way .
it's often difficult to look up a table , a chair , a door , a side board .
what do you mean , madam?
perhaps i should introduce you the children .
mr. toltle , you can go to the garden now .
you'll find tools in the shed .
yes , madam .
and you can start closing the curtain .
come .
i will wake them , and you wait here .
whatever you do , don't open the curtain .
they're still half asleep .
sweet little children .
well , what do you say?
how do you do?
how do you do?
how do you do , children?
my name is mrs. smiths .
but you can call me bother , if you like . what are your names?
ann .
nicholas .
ann and nicholas .
what a pretty names .
what you goin'to be our new nanny?
yes , my dears .
i'm your new nanny .
it's time for the breakfast . lydia , go to the kitchen and close every curtain .
doctors are unable to find up the cure .
about what?
their condition .
the children have a very serious allergy to light .
they have never been exposed to any light much stronger than this .
otherwise , in a matter of minutes they will break up in souls .
and begin to suffocated and will eventually to fatal . // my god !
i don't like this toast .
why not?
it tastes funny . l like it better before .
that is because before , somebody else made it .
when are they comin 'back?
they're not comin 'back , child .
just like daddy .
daddy is comin 'back , though . mrs. smiths , our father is fighting in the war in france .
it's the world war .
i know , but he's in france .
that's enough , finish up your breakfast .
are you goin 'to leave us too?
of course not .
why should i leave you?
the other said they wouldn't .
they did .
and when it happened ...
be quiet !
what do you mean , ann?
what'd happened?
mummy went mad .
nothing happened .
yes , it did .
no , it didn't !
yes it did !
quiet !
what's goin 'on?
i want to see those plates empty in less than a minute , is that clear?
mrs. smiths , would you come outside for a moment? l have word with you .
yes , madam .
the postman usually comes every wednesday .
but i just checked the letterbox .
ln this week, he hasn't .
i'm afraid i don't follow , madam .
this letter should been collected and delivered to the newspaper five days ago .
since it never published , would you mind explain to me what you're doin 'here?
oh , i understand ...
remember exactly what i say when you opened the door to us .
the truth is , we just came by to ask for a chance .
you know , because like this will need someone who knows the rules .
you mean , you've served in a house like this one before .
this may surprise you .
we in fact , just worked here .
here?
it was a few years ago .
lf you don't mind i'm saying so , madam , it was the best years of my life .
because this house ... mean a lot to us .
perhaps you want to see our references , madam .
no , no ... no ...
don't bother this , no need .
so , you say you know the house well .
like the back of my hand .
well , still assuming that the wall hasn't been moved in the meantime .
nothing here is moved except the light .
but it changes everything .
yes , madam .
i don't like fantasy . strange ideas , do you know what i mean?
i think so , madam ...
my children sometimes have strange ideas .
but you mustn't paying attention to them . children will be children .
yes of course , madam .
alright , you can stay .
thank you very much , madam .
what do you find so amusing?
well ...
what?
those children were really stupid .
why?
because they only believe in jesus , and then they get killed for it .
and what would you gonna to do , deny christ?
yes . lnside i would have believed in him .
but i wouldn't told the roman .
ls that what you think too , nicholas?
i see . so you both would have lie to the point to denying christ .
but what will happen afterwards?
ln the next life?
the one is waiting for us after we die ,
where if you have gone?
where , nicholas?
to the limbo .
what is the children limbo?
one of the four hell .
which are?
me ... me ... me ...
no , no , no ...
let him answer .
at the centre of the earth . where it is very very hot .
that's where children goes , they're liar , they don't go there just for a few days .
they are the damned ... forever .
think about it .
try to imagine . the end of eternity .
close your eyes and try to imagine .
forever .
pain .
forever .
i'm getting dizzy .
now , do you understand justice above the truth .
alright , read lesson six .
can we go and play?
you most certainly can not and you're gonna to learn it by heart .
because you're goin 'to read the lesson , all of it?
and anymore protesting , there'll be no playing for today .
ln fact , maybe you can study inside the room .
no , no , no !
yes , yes , yes ...
we get scare if we were to separated .
you get scare?
you don't get use to the house by now .
what if we see a ghost?
has your sister been telling you one of the story?
i haven't told him anything .
when you see a ghost , you say hello and you continue study
ann , come with me to the music room .
why me?
take your book .
nicholas , i want to see that lesson // learn less than a hour .
mummy .
what?
give me a kiss .
give me a kiss .
give me a kiss .
ann , wait for me outside .
you know i can't .
mrs. smiths , close the curtain .
my daughter is going the living room .
yes , madam .
alright .
darling .
mummy can't be with you all the time .
you must learn to be on your own .
whenever you're afraid , i want you to squeeze it .
say " our father " , then your fear will go away .
it won't .
yes , yes , it will .
don't you see that when you do that ,
the lord is with you .
there is no reason to be afraid .
do you have any children?
no , mr toltle and lydia are all i've got and i'm all they got .
was she born like that?
i don't remember .
was she born a mute?
no .
i've finish work here .
you excuse me , i'll see mr. toltle to give him hand .
nicholas !
nicholas , i'm coming .

what's the matter?
why are you crying?
i wasn't crying , i was reading !
but , i just heard you ...
ann .
ann !
ann?

yes !
why were you crying?
i wasn't crying .
but i just heard you a moment ago .
there is no need to feel ashame .
i don't ! lf i've been crying , i will tell you .
so , i imagined it , did l?
no , it's was that boy .
what boy?
victor ,
who's victor?
the boy that was here a moment ago .
i told him to let me study .
but he wouldn't stop crying .
i think he is a spoilt brag .
he said that we have to leave the house .
oh?
did he now?
why was he crying?
because he doesn't like this house , but he has to live here .
his father is a pianist ...
oh?
his father is a pianist, is he?
i have already told him that he is not allow to touch the piano .
so , you've spoken to his father as well?
no , only with victor . his father is at the entrance // of the hall .
but i've just come from the hall , and there is no one there .
they must have gone upstairs .
that will do ann !
that's enough .
now why are you crying?
that was victor .
so where is he now?
he went out through there .
tell me , how a boy can get in and out this room with this lock?
i thought i made myself quite clear .
no door is to be open without the previous one being close . ls that so hard to understand?
this house is like a ship, the light must be in contain by opening and closing the doors .
my children's life are so important .
but madam , i ...
don't argue with me , quiet !
now , which one of you was the last to enter that room? lydia?
she hasn't got the key , i've already told you that .
well , that leave you then .
and then i went out to the garden .
you saw me with your own eyes .
i hope you're not suggesting it was me?
do you think i'll endanger the life of my own daughter?
you're not suppose to read at that table .
oh really?
you are gonna to tell mummy?
or perhaps you?
did you really see a boy?
yes , he is called victor .
ls he a ghost?
don't be stupid , ghosts aren't like that .
what are they like?
how do you know?
because i've seen them .
they come out at night .
where?
well , i don't believe you saw that boy .
believe what you like , you soon will begging us to play with you .
nicholas .
what?
look !
why have you opened the curtains?
it wasn't me .
who was then? lt was victor .
he's been doing it all night .
you're lying , i'm gonna to tell mummy .
so , i am a liar , am l?
yes .
victor , come out .
my stupid brother wants to see you .
leave me alone .
so , you don't want to see him now?
you're a cowdy custard .
i will just have to do it myself then .
stop it , get out of my bed , both of you .
this is our bed .
no , it's mine .
ann , please don't put on that voice .
you be quiet , cowdy custard .

she was frighting me , i told her to be quiet ...
i'm fed up with you !

that was not we have agreed .
today you will be punish , and you will do as i say .
you can't ask me for a forgiveness .
how dare you .
mummy , i won't ask forgiveness for something that i didn't do .
you told your brother there was someone else in the room . there was .
you're lying !
i am not .
ann , do you remember the story about justice?
children who don't tell the truth ends up in limbo .
i've read the other day that's for children who haven't been baptised .
and i have .
did you look in on nicholas?
yes madam , the little angel is fast asleep .
what about ann?
she still on the stairs?
yes , madam .
how long the punishment is going on?
it has been three days now .
it's up to her .
she has to swallow her pride and ask for forgiveness .
anyway , it's about time she started to read the bible .
the priest will be very pleased to hear about that ,
he know perfectly well , the children can't go out .
he told me yesterday he'll be by us soon as possible .
i've beginning to feel totally cut off from the world .
that's true , madam .
ann , i can't hear you .
lncidently , mrs. smiths , i have to put out the noise of lydia ,
running around above my head .
she'd been doing it back and forward .
would you tell her it's not necessary to get around just to do cleaning?
i couldn't bear to take another migraine attack .
i'll tell her .
thank you .
what's going on upstair?
nothing , mummy .
i'm just reading like you've told me .
did you hear that as well?
hear what?
what was that?
i don't know .
ann , tell me who's making that noise .
i can't tell you , mummy .
you tell me .
i've told you there was someone in the room and you punished me
honey , i want the truth .
tell me if there is someone upstair .
there , in that junk room .
mummy , you're letting the light in .
where did they go?
they just came pass here .
which way did they go?
over there , over there .
all and down there as well .
they are everywhere .
they said this house is their .
and they said they will take the curtain down as well .
madam , stay calm please .
i would not stay calm .
madam , this is a very old house the floor is squeezed from the foaming plan .
there were voices , i am telling you .
a boy and two women and they were talking together .
mummy , mummy , look .
i did it yesterday .
this is the father , this is the mother . this is victor this is the old woman .
what is this number stand for?
that is the number of times ...
i see the old woman the most .
oh my god and heaven !
mrs. smiths , go to call mr. toltle .
we've to search the house immediately .
it's alright , mummy's here .
even she is not looking at you , but she can see you .
she's always around said " come with me " .
ann , don't lie to me !
honestly , mummy . and she asked me things victor told me she's a witch .
what did she ask you?
things .
we have to open all the curtains .
you both search the right side ...
then we'll search upstairs .
ann , why do you makeup such story?
i don't .
i read them in books .
well you shouldn't believe everything that you read in books .
that's what our mother said she says about the ghost are rubbish .
and then , she expect us to believe that everything we read in the bible .
don't you believe it?
believe something i don't believe god makes the world in seven days .
i don't believe that normans got all the animal into one boat .
no , i don't believe that either .
have you mentioned any of this to your mother?
madam .
yes?
we've searched everywhere there is no one .
i see .
mrs. smiths .
yes , madam .
do you have any idea what this might be?
it's a photograph album , madam .
look .
they are all asleep .
they're not asleep , madam .
they are dead .
this is the book of death .
ln the last century , i believe they take photographs of the death .
ln the hopes , their souls will go on living . oh , and children .
how can these people be so superstitious?
grateful to the people that can lead them to do strange things .
get rid of it .
i don't want it in the house . yes , madam .
mrs smiths , why don't you come and sit by the fire?
thank you very much .
warmer ...
do you have to take care of the children as well?
so , i was in charge of the organising ... the houseworks .
are there many servants?
oh !
about fifteen .
ln the end , there were just three of us left . why?
my employers moved to london .
my family left at the summer of 1940 .
that was the last time i've heard from them .
was that when lydia went dumb?
yes , i think so . you know my memory is little lost , madam .
what happen to her?
suddenly one day , she just stop talking .
there must be a reason .
people don't just stop talking .
something must have happened to her .
did your employers treat you well?
oh !
they are always very kind to us .
they treated us just like family .
you know , madam .
i think i will go to bed .
you go .
i will stay here a while longer .
i'm sorry .
i shouted at you .
can you forgive me?
mummy .
what?
when is daddy comin 'home?
when the war is over .
daddy went because he is very brave .
and because he wasn't prepare to let the german tell him what he had to do .
mrs. smiths !
give me the keys , hurry up !
what's happening?
oh my god !
i've checked that room myself .
it was empty .
take this tablets , madam .
and yet , i found there was someone downstair .
and it wasn't human .
there is something in this house .
something which is not like ... at rest .
you don't believe it , do you?
i don't blame you .
i used to not believe in these things .
i do believe it , madam .
i've always believe in those things .
but that is not easy to explain .
but , they do happen . we all heard stories from beyond now and then .
the world of the death is mix up with the world of the living .
but it's impossible . the lord will not allow such a thing like living with the death .
that will only mean only the eternity .
it say so in the bible .
there isn't always an answer for everything .
where are you off to , madam?
i'm goin 'to the village to find the father .
lf he won't come here , then i'd go to him .
you should wait for the weather in full . i have waited long enough .
madam .
i don't care what he has told you , tell me .
he must come today .
what are you gonna to tell him?
to search every room inch by inch .
madam , please wait .
it's still very early .
mr. toltle .
good morning , madam .
i need you to search the whole garden for grave stone . grave stone?
when my husband bought this house he said there was a cemetary .
i'm not seeing anything !
take care , that could be overgrowth .
i need to know it there was a family buried here .
now she thinks the house is haunted .
do you think it's safe to let her go?
don't worry .
the fog wouldn't let her go very far .
oh yes !
the fog .
the fog , of course .
when do you think we should bring this out into the open?
all in good time , all in good time .
speaking of which ...
oh !
charles !
grace .
oh !
oh ! lt can't be true , it can't be true .
they said you are dead .
they said a lot of things .
thank you god .
every night i pray for this , begging god to bring you back .
where have you been all this time?
out there , looking for my home .
sometimes i bleed ...
madam .
mrs. smiths .
this is my husband .
i am very pleased to meet you , sir .
i want you to prepare hot water and some clean clothes and something to eat .
right away , madam .

when is daddy comin 'down?
daddy is very tired .
he said he saw a lots of dead man .
mummy , when people died in the war , where do they go?
what a question ...

on the good ease or bad ease .
your father is from good ease .
how do you know who is the good or bad are?
enough question .

you'll never go to war .
we'll never go anywhere .

then everything will be different .
how?
oh !
you'll see .
there are goin 'to be some big surprises .
there're are going to be changes .
changes?
now she is behaving as nothing has happened .
what about her daughter?
she is not so stubborn .
she is much more easier to convince .
it's her mother who's gonna cause us problems .
do you think her husband suspect anything?
no , i don't think he even knows where he is .
oh !

what's the matter?
where is my daughter?

alright , come with me .
you wicked !
wicked !
how is she?
i lefted her with her father .
she insists speaking to him .

she was imitating my daughter's voice .
i swear to god it wasn't my daughter .
god help me , what's the matter with me .
i don't know what's the matter with me .
you must get more rest .
we know what has to be done .
