the mexican cartels have 1, 500 miles of border between them and the greatest drug consuming nation on earth ... ... separated by a 15 foot high fence which starts at the pacific ocean and travels the distance of four states .
they flood our streets , day after day , week after week , at an average of 20 tons a month .
that's enough to provide a line of cocaine for every man , woman , and child on this planet .
yeah?
it's me .
what's up?
i've got tickets to the tuesday game .
is that right?
row 10 , seat 14 .
14?
oh , i'm with that !
i'll see you there .
from 10 tons a week ago in colombia to one bump tonight in l. a. , worlds away from the men who run the whole goddamned show .
and remember , no one must make all the arrests .
we book them downtown , and the extradition will take place from there .
are we clear?
we're clear that you wouldn't be going in there without us .
you heard the man .
let's get ready to move .
demetrius , let's have the gun .
est loco .
you gotta be kidding me , frost .
we are on their turf .
isn't that right , sean?
come on .
memo lucero was a colombian who saw opportunity in mexico's northern border towns .
he set up shop in tijuana and built the busiest , most lucrative drug pipeline the world has ever seen .
lucero never slept in the same place twice , so no one ever knew where he was .
but after seven years , we finally tracked him down .
let's go .
frost , this is stupid .
they call us down here .
they take away our weapons?
they expect us to go into a building full of drunken cartel gunmen unarmed?
i mean , that isn't fun .
you're not getting paid to have fun .
good luck , gentlemen .
bureaucrats !
ay , chingado .
all right .
stay down !
shit !
you have no idea what kind of mistake you're making .
put your hands up !
things are only gonna get worse , for all of us .
do me a favor and shut the fuck up !
come on .
boss , let me go home and see my wife .
i'll think about it .
i can't go home and see my wife?
i'll think about it !
get out of here , you knucklehead !
hey !
good job !
damn right , good job !
seven years , dog !
we got him !
where are you?
honey , i'm still down here .
are you okay?
yeah , i'm okay .
it was a little crazy , but i'll be home tomorrow or the next day .
right .
baby ... ... what are you wearing?
one of your old jerseys .
not that blue one that you look incredibly sexy in .
yeah , the one that smells like you .
is that a good thing?
it's a great thing .
what are you doing right now?
making candles .
is that pine or evergreen?
sean !
it's my favorite one .
of course it is .
oh , i miss you !
two months ago , with the arrest of memo lucero , we finally dealt the pacific corridor its first substantial blow .
we didn't talk like cops , we didn't look like cops , we didn't act like cops .
for that matter , we never hung out with them , either .
we had an edge that came from growing up on the streets .
that's why were the most successful anti narcotics crew in law enforcement .
we made the dent that the naysayers said we couldn't make .
from this day forward , things will be different .
by taking out lucero , we have cut the head off the dragon .
and now we are sending an emphatic message to anyone out there who may have designs on filling the void left by memo lucero .
the cartels know now that the u. s. will not stand by idly while they pollute our shores with their narcotics .
what's happening , homes?
peace will be restored , and the flow of cocaine will stop .
i'm happy to announce that , effective today , their business in southern california is over .
to the men and women of our undercover units , enjoy the accolades , because you've certainly earned them .
they want to play in a tournament .
they want to ball against us , dog .
against who?
ramon cardena was killed yesterday .
who , lucero's guy?
yeah , state's attorney's .
i'm not gonna shed any tears over it , but i am concerned about one thing ... this could get a little bit messy .
frost , this is for you .
it's eucalyptus , for enlightenment .
enlightenment?
baby , he's a senior citizen .
give him the viagra candle .
sean !
big sexy !
what's up , dog?
what did i tell you about smoking?
i got you , dog .
you don't want me to put you in the sleeper hold .
what's up with all these damn narc cars out here?
is this a police convention?
supposed to be a damn barbecue , dog .
believe me , you're cool here .
you're with me .
it's my house .
i sure hope it's cool to go through .
thanks .
hi .

yeah !
oh , my goodness !
talkin 'to me !
yeah?
imagine she was like us ... just wanted to fuck , you know what i'm saying?
right here , right now .
why can't women think like that?
sometimes a man got to get his fuck on without love getting in the way of it , that's all i'm saying .
can i get an amen up in here?
amen .
that's what i'm talking about .
now , i'm sure that my man sean feels the same way , right?
yes .
huh?
yes .
get the hell out of here !
why you trying to do that to me?
hey , dog , his girl got him whipped , dog , for real .
oh , you're not whipped?

there was no electricity , dirt floors .
when it would rain ... ... we couldn't sleep 'cause the raindrops on the tin roof were too loud .
what did you call me down here for?
i might be able to help you .
you had your chance to talk to me .
they killed my wife ... ... and my son .
when there's a change at the top , they start over , build their own pipeline .

diablo's been pulling some bold fuckin 'moves .
he's been clipping the lower level guys , cutting 'em clean out .
bam !
gone !
streamlinin 'the pipeline .
now , with us , they've got to walk on eggshells .
they fuck with us , they got problems in the jails .
we'll kick their wetback ass in every jail in the state .

the man that runs this organization calls himself diablo .
this man is jack slayton .
everything we have leads to him .
what the fuck are you reading?
does that have anything to do with what we were talking about?
if you don't want to be here , get out !
get on with it .
the second move ...
the second big move is to flood the whole entire west coast with more coke than we've ever seen before in a straight up hostile takeover .
if that happens , we're right back where we started .
we shouldn't have gone to mexico .
we can do this .
we can shut them down before they become the next dominant cartel .
it's very important to me .
they're ruthless .
come into your fuckin 'home .

you don't know me .
you want to do business or not?

we're taking over the corridor .
you know that , don't you?
anybody who fucks with diablo ...
come on .

from the wreckage , officials believe the gunmen attacked with semiautomatic weapons , killing two bureau of prisons officers and injuring several others .
the specifics are being withheld until the investigation is complete , but we believe that the gunmen were able to spring cartel leader memo lucero , who was serving two life sentences for a string of murders and trafficking of narcotics .
the prisoner was being transferred to a maximum security prison outside l. a.
i signed the transfer .
it is not your fault that lucero busted out , okay?
yeah , but i recommended it .
they say he's somewhere in mexico , man .
he's not in mexico , demetrius .
how do you know that?
i'm taking frost's advice .
i'm taking a little time .
sean , where you at?
don't worry .
i'm in a good place .
i'm recovering .
just give me a call soon , all right?
okay .
this will only take a second .
i got all the time in the world .
i tracked you for seven years .
you never went to the same place twice .
until you came home .
i told you you had no idea what you were getting yourself into .
if you'd stayed out of my business , your wife would still be alive .
your arrogance killed her , not me .
like your arrogance coming here !
do you think you can come into my domain and kill me?
if i wanted you dead , you would be .
finish the job .
i know that you're with me in spirit .
but i still miss you .
you okay?
who picked the stone?
we all did .
yeah , she would have liked that .
