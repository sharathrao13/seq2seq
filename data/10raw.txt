as captain escalona is fond of saying ... ... we know more about where the rebels are than they do themselves .
i see how all this helps with their rebel problem here ... ... but how are we doing in the war against the akd?
certain factions of the rebels ... ... are akd .
right , but ... ... the mindanao rebels have fought the government ... ... for more than 30 years .
now suddenly , you've decided they're akd?
why?
we believe that their ... ... withdrawal from the peace negotiations ... ... and the recent surge in bombings and kidnappings ... ... are directly related to akd .
the philippine government is certain of this .

recon six saw signal smoke .

they launched two stingers .
at the recon plane .
general lewis , sir , the pentagon .
if they launch missiles ... ... on a plane that is that far out ... ... the akd must have bought them a lot of ammo .
general lewis , here .
congratulations , general .
your special ops team was shot down before they got near the target .
you lost two rescue choppers .
and apparently , the survivors were taken hostage .
oh , jesus christ .
what was that?
i said we have a bad line , sir .
this is a total command failure .
embarrassing .
we believed our intelligence to be good .
we based our strategy on it .
the enemy doesn't always do what you want them to do .
they have a choice too .
damn right .
and what do you think they're gonna do ... ... to captured american soldiers?
how do you think the american public is going to react to a video of ...
who's the captain?
jennings .
okay .
jennings , begging for life .
you think that's going to help recruitment?
we'll get her out , sir .
good .
they're your stars .

daniels and montalvo .
if there are any survivors , they're the ones who can get them back .
patrol three .
confirm orders to circle back and return to base .

we got nothing out here .

yeah , there is .
yeah .
what are you gonna teach your kids?
oh , i don't have any kids .
not now , but ...
do you have a husband?
not that i've met .
smart , fine woman like you?
thank you .
i wouldn't want my wife to be in a mess like this .
well ... ... maybe that's why i haven't found him yet .
yeah .
you know ... ... it was really brave of you to come back for me .
thanks .
when the opportunity presents itself ... ... you have to escape .
i'm in no shape to go with you .
all right .
don't you wanna get some sleep , sir?
i just wanna get these done .
get them back to the families .
lieutenant montalvo's looking for you .
says we got new orders .
when we heard the choppers ... ...
i knew i had a chance to escape .
but then i met abubakar .
the man we were sent to catch .
all right .
rebels shot down three of our helicopters in less then one hour .
flyboys can't get in there , so they're calling in the grunts .
high altitude recon shows nothing left of the team ... ... so we're looking for survivors from eagle one .
that's the ranger squad under major diego aginaldo .
and two americans .
special ops coordinator lieutenant mark pierce ... ... and captain amy jennings , pilot out of 3rd tactical .
the main force will be pursuing rebel leadership .
but they're going the same place we are .
so we're gonna take the river .
get up ahead of them , deep in rebel territory .
general bondoc's 2nd army is pushing a group of rebels ... ... up from the south .
that means we've got ... ... two prongs ... ... squeezing a whole bunch of rebels right where we're going .
our job is to get there first ... ... and get our marines back .
brief your fire teams .
we move out in ten mikes .
lieutenant .
what were they doing out here?
who's that?
the rangers and that chick pilot .
that pilot is a marine aviator and a superior officer .
no offense , sir ... ... but i won't even let my old lady drive my car .
she was a counterinsurgency specialist .
hq sent them out here to capture one of the rebel leaders .
abubakar al hassan ... ... al qaeda's number two in southeast asia .
let's get the men ashore .
take cover .
lieutenant daniels .
lieutenant reyes , philippine army .
we were two days ahead of schedule ... ... until they started hitting our flank .
sounds like a trap .
the rest of the air support and divisions ... ... are tied up about 5 klicks back .
what about you guys?
looking for a huey that went down in delta five .
that's just the other side of this mess .
damn , they've got the range .
how about the back side?
it's mined .
jackson .
get up here .
got a minefield .
can you clear it?
i'm not packing that kind of gear .
how about if we drop a coconut tree?
that'll work .
good , get on it .
roger that , sir .
they won't be expecting us .
jackson , go .

go , go .
two oh three !
two oh three !
jackson , i'm in .

all clear .
jackson , you all right?
here comes the cavalry .
i didn't know why i was still alive .
but as they took me deeper into rebel territory ... ... it was clear they wanted something .
she says they left the village .
did they have any prisoners?
she says they have a woman prisoner .
they have captain jennings .
abaya , radio .

and so will you .
abaya .
sir .
radio lieutenant reyes back at the village .
tell him we found major aginaldo's body .
yes , sir .
cooper , move out .
don't wanna think about what they're doing to captain jennings .
neither do i.
abubakar wanted me to talk .
not for what i knew , but for what i could say .
government ... ... and american soldier ... ... must leave mindanao .
say it .
captain amy jennings ... ... united states marine corps .
service number 57184337 .
god bless ameri ...
government and american soldiers ... ... must leave mindanao .

captain amy jennings ... ... united states marine corps ...

roger that .
alpha out .
intel doesn't have a damn clue .
jackson , what do you have up there?
looks like it gets pretty thick .
coop , what about you?
i got a road leading up .
what do you think?
i think straight up .
we'll try to get a view from a high point .
if we can't see anything ... ... at least we've got a defensible bivouac for the night .
all right .
all right , we're going up .
move out .
what do you mean he's not in hq?
he's not here , sir .
can you find him?
no .
no?
well , then , where is the general?
that's classified information , sir .
roger that .
alpha out .
worthless .
they rolled up hq .
is this operation over?
last we heard , abubakar was taking her in that direction .
we're not out here to let her slip away .
that bastard .
he's got her .
until we get other orders ... ... we've got a soldier to save .
let's pack it up .
move it out .
looks like one of ours .
it's a dray .
cooper , go .
go , go .
moving out .
damn , looks like they've got a lot of firepower out here .
they must have moved up the assault .
jackson , talk to a supply sergeant .
see if we can get more ammo .
yes , sir .
coop , you and the men take 10 .
roger that , sir .
how are you doing , sir?
hey .
general lewis , sir?
roger that .
this way , sir .
gentlemen .
sir .
i'm sorry i can't do more for you right now .
we cannot hold off the assault .

mission first .
marine always .
you're doing a good job , lieutenant .

right now i'd settle for some cartoons and some real breakfast , coop .
roger that .
all right , guys , rally up .
sir , where are those troops going?
same place we are , coop .
all right .
this is it .
the place they're holding captain jennings .
right here .
it's heavily fortified and crawling with bogeys .
general al fatwa's training camp .
there's only one road into it ... ... and general panlilo's taking the main force right up it .
air support is committed to a rebel reinforcement column ... ... moving down the back side of these mountains .
until the main force gets there , it's just us and a whole lot of them .
this is general rashid al fatwa .
he runs the camp .
and intel's latest photo of our old buddy abubakar .
they've got captain jennings .
we're gonna get her out .
intel says abubakar's made an alliance ... ... with the remnants of another rebel group .
that leaves us the hills to the south .
impassable for trucks and heavy armor .
so we're hoofing it .
general says the main force is moving out at zero nine ... ... so we're gonna have to haul ass to get to that camp .
any questions?
make sure you guys chow down , have some water ... ... move out in five mikes .
let's go get our marine back .
who's leading the column?
twenty three , apc .
they move in five minutes .
if they move in five minutes , we'll give ... ... daniels and montalvo a 15 minute head start , at the most .
what if we delay the artillery?
save you a few good men .
orders are orders , general , but ... ... the pentagon can kiss my ass .
there's a watchtower .
good eyes , cooper .
all right .
let's try to get through that .
cut to the right .
right here , single file .
roger that , sir .
the main force should be moving already .
means the base is on the other side .
let's see if we can get over there undetected .
where is to come?
when will be attack?
no .
don't .
please?
i don't know .
when will be attack?
i don't know .
tell me .
i don't know .
tell me .
the main force is late .
maybe the general's bought us some time .
we've gotta hurry before the artillery drops on us .
unless we wanna take some shrapnel up the backside .

what's going on?
couple of guys arguing .
let me take a look .
the guy in black's abubakar .
you want me to take him out?
not yet .
if he's here , he might lead us to captain jennings .
i think the guy with the video camera is entering the building .

you didn't lose anyone , daniels .
we trained them well .
and we fought hard .

the rebels took them .
al qaeda took them .
