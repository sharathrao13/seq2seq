lf you say so
how much you want?
900 dollars , but don't put it in
you think i'm just giving you money for nothing?
you want me to just touch you several times and give $900?

i own several hotels and host bars
you heard of 'date club 'right?
girls like you mess up the whole business
i'm really sorry i'll never do it again

but i'm your employer now
i need some young ones
i don't want to have sex with you i have a daughter too
i just had an abortion today
i'm really in bad condition now
didn't you ever get in trouble?
didn't the guys ever threat you?
or runaway without paying?
i didn't get paid for 3 times but it's my first time to be scared
lf you work under me i'll protect you from those things
maybe after i graduate from high school i would ...
alright
then you pay me for today
i pay you?
cloth , hotel fee , and the fee for the lecture , total 900
i don't have that much
you better pay
lf you don't have any money give me your school ld card
i don't have any ld cards either
give me that bag
hey , i brought the product

how did you find about this place?
because ...
i heard you guys pay a lot
pay a lot?
just pay me like you normally do
we don't pay normally like we do
how much you want?
normally i heard it's from $1 0 to $1 00 , but ...
but?
are you trying to dump on me?
not from the second time
that means you do from the first time , huh?
come on , think about it
think about what?
perverts who buy these underwears?
or the existence of this stupid store?
girls like you sell their underwears that's why there's shop like this and those perverts
love young girls like you
you came here for money anyways
how much you want?
50 dollars
think smart
how much is good enough?
you want to sell it 'warm '? 'warm '?
you take it off now and sell it
take it off and hang it there
ln office behind there are fresh underwears
take whatever you want
auction fee will be 20 %
you know what's even worse?
this pervert comes up to me and asks if he can buy my shit
it's all because of tv
they portray high school girls weirdly
think we sell everything
that's almost sexual harassment
oh yeah , i went to 'harajuku 'today and somebody from behind says 'hey , cutie '
how old are you? so i said '1 7 'and
'oh , talk to you later 'than he goes away
serious?
they want junior high girls now
think high school girls are too old
yeah , true that
no body asks me
why though?
stop laughing
hey stop
they think i'm chinese
that's not something to laugh about
i heard you gonna marry before you become 20
lsn't that too early though?
why?
it's all good
you gonna marry someday anyways
i wanna marry too
i want to do something cool when i get married
i want to take naked picture with my baby
naked picture?
what the hell are you thinking
think it's gonna be nice
do whatever you want
marry early but don't have babies too early
it's different when it's yours your babies are always lovely
not really because you will never get one huh?
seriously , they are not cute
they maybe look cute when they are little but think about when they get to our age it will be terrible
your mom is probably thinking same
what happened to my sweet little baby?
ls she on dope or something?
college guys are stupid too
wearing some stupid suit all the time
they can't even smoke and they think they're cool
yeah , those dumb kids
that's why we gotta do it now
lf we become 20 we'll be arrested
when i become 20 i'll stop smoking and all the bad things
marry early and beloved everyday
ln your dreams !
guys never stay loyal to their wife
they always look for new women
good examples are guys who pay to have sex with us
they even have daughters about our age
i'm not gonna marry those kind of perverts
this is when this phrase come up !
'what goes around comes around ! '
what the hell you mean?
whatever you think i mean !
i'm going
i got caught by a gang

what's so surprising?
there's too many
those are the only ones that are that many

professionals earn money safely

they're doing this so we don't get paid
never knew shit like this would happen
but you got your passport and ticket right?
but ... at least you got those ...
virgin marry thanks
so , talk about it
how you can earn money like that
every gangs over the japan would be curious about it
nobody would come up with idea like that
it's nothing special
it always happened since my elementary school
i'll pay you money let me have kiss
i'll pay you more let me have sex every girls get caught by perverts in subways too
that's what this country's all about
you mean women are men's sex toy
because we need money
then how?
how can going to karaoke can earn $000?
there are no adults with brain these days
teens know how to use those adults
old ones are the toys for young ones now
money is everything
not for $1 00 but we kiss for $1 0000
that's what kids think
adults with brains stop right there
but they still want to do it
this world is even scary to us
at least you got your passport and ticket
you can leave many friends there huh?
can't leave without any money though
then you better return home
i'll help you with money for the train
thanks but i need to go to new york
why are you so desperate?
i heard lot of gangs are there
gangs are everywhere
america has 'just do it 'mentality
just do it?
trust yourself and try your best then you can do anything
what about japan?
moment you say it you find yourself silly
right lot of people are like that
emotional instability that's right
everybody they're all insane
i don't even go to school
how about home?
twice in a week maybe
your parents don't say anything?
they thank i at least come home sometimes
call girls !
my parents aren't like that
i came back to japan to go to high school
watch out !
essence of call girl business is the large profit
but they can't be good as our sex business
leave us alone
that's what you're saying
we aren't gonna do that forever also we don't intend to sell our bodies
you don't but guys want it
it's not that simple
then i runaway with the money
wait for second
bring that
everybody's insane
robbers ..
sadists ...
there's many of them
that's true
see?
that's why you can't protect yourself
not really though
you used it before?
about 5 guys
didn't police come?
who would call police for being knocked out by call girls
this doctor from 'sapporo '
he always wear 'versace '
he pay you $500 for just having a meal together and even buys you lot of stuff but at the end he wants to have sex
i hooked up this girl who wanted to do it 3 adults are on reservation
all on waiting list
you want one too?
lf you choose to do so
but you don't have to do it if you don't like it
this $400 is from 'maru '
you know what relationship we just made?
'trustworthy relationship '
trust ... relationship
'jonco 'and me
let's have meal together once a month
not call girl relationship but just 'trustworthy relationship '
what you think?
good
last week we had 'members meeting '
light !
last year some country call girl came to the city and earned bunch of money
amateur call girl business became famous
professional's sex business got harmed a lot
no idea for what to do this year
one thing for sure is that tokyo is full of perverts
heard of country called 'columbia '?
heard about their drug business
really?
yes
the columbia i know ... is the birthplace for father 'garcia 'and 'kamilo '
there was a 'street keeper 'in columbia
lf there was a drug related problem they find out the dealers shoot them in the head 7 times
then they trash the dead body in the streets
next day there's no more drug deals there
prostitution is similar to that
it's under 'social cleaning '
people are thinking about having that system in tokyo
lf they don't listen to the warning we just say 'one call girl in the streets of sibuya '!
you better watch out too
lf there's no police , then there's the gang
alright
i got a penalty this time
next time you do it , everything's over
i can do anything , i'll work for $1 000
i can sing old songs too
i done it several times
no more fights
let's get together
ah lnternational
we will make it come true
no more wars and fights
let's get together
ah lnternational
we will make it come true

lf she gets caught actually the guy's in the problem
she uses stern gun on him and runs away again
'lisa ! '
there's nothing to fear
you don't want to go home do you?

i had this feeling with 'lisa '
we were truthful to each other
when i shot the fire extinguisher
i was in nirvana
adrenaline was pumping out
i was getting all excited
that was the best moment of my life
then look for her
when they were cleaning my head then i realized that my one and only true lover is her
even though we are really different
so what?
you guys are different
there's something similar at least we are same human
you are annoying
forget about it talk about it tomorrow
anyways ... all the girls are after name brands even jeans and shoes all name brands but 'lisa" s different she doesn't wear those
she concerns people who make the cloth
lsn't that great?
how nice of her?

that 'place '?
military prostitution
i researched about all the asian women their patience , integrity and specialties
the best are korean women since 1 941 i only brought korean girls ... to the new unit
it was a hard task according to their ranks they have limited time general gets the most time lieutenant gets the next most
we even had to decide price by the rank
that management skill is what we learned ...
land forces in this school navies in other school ... taught how to manage military prostitutions
prime minister of japan graduated from naval school
people think only borneo prostitution is the problem but minister brought girls from other countries too
japanese did lot of bad things to asian nations
but why?
it's been almost 50 years ...
why giving me criminal record all the sudden?
why does us care about prostitution court case?
doesn't make any sense

what are you doing?

just do what i said you'll get paid $2000
can i wear gloves?
no it's only worthy when done with bare hands
you can't do this in la or new york
because it's unsafe there
that's from 1 0 years ago it's unsafe here too
shut up
you chinese bitch do what i tell you
it's safe in japan so just do it

lose yourself

there's a problem in the park
a call girl got beat up
her and her friends tried to rob the person but ended up getting herself into problem her friends ranaway and only the girl got caught ...
i'm the victim you understand?
it seems she's the victim but you know how teenagers are these days
we understand your situation
what's your name?
for what?
just let me know
i'm 'sato '
mr. 'sato 'please listen
don't let my family know about this
she got hurt badly
she almost died
you heard what happened at 'roppongi club? '
i heard i'll be there soon
it's 'jonco 'for sure
i'll look after her
i know some of her friends
i called nearby hotels just in case if something happens again
lf there's problem with those guys , we will get into bad situation as well
lf we don't stop it here situation will be worse
work it out right
that guys one of them is a governor , huh?
other is just dumbass he's a baseball player
i don't know how he was 4th batter and first base
he's too thoughtless
call girl or not he doesn't care
these days high school girls are crazy
even their looks are messed up
none of them tries to fulfill something
there is i saw one today
where?
i'm not telling you
one of the rare good girls but i hooked her up with the video shooting
girls who sells her underwear is good?
that's like selling herself
they even talk in those weird slangs
we are old now
there are no girls with passion and integrity
they live in different generation
only we needed passion and integrity to survive
times have changed
fill my glass too
do it by yourself
i'm the 'flower girl 'for today
thanks mr. 'bura '
that was a mistake
i hit him too hard
that was bad
that dumbass
we better use the money wisely
i bought too much name brands since i feel bad about the dirty money of perverts
somewhat disgusting ...
that's true
once i had a doll that's $20, 000 $20, 000?
problem was that it looked scary
so i gave it away to somebody
you don't care about name brands right?
i care about who made the cloth
you want to be a designer huh?
when i was in new york there was this kid who came up to me with this soccer ball
he asked me if i knew who made that ball
sounds boring boring !
it's not boring
there were 250 million kids from age 5 to 1 4 working in factories to make that
so when i buy the products
i think about those kids
manners and integrity change with the time
get rid of your old definitions
you are being corrupted like the young ones
what's the matter with you?
what's wrong with being old minded?
men and women are different
what you think can be different from what we think
everything's same
this and that
everything under your definition
don't say it , do it
use your body !
i don't understand what your saying
i became a friend with a call girl
really?
we sang the 'lnternational song 'together
serious?
serious?
that girl knows that song?
you'll bother other people you sing really bad
do it right
hey turn on the 'lnternational song '
you are annoying i'm leaving
what do you wanna do in new york?
study
that's exciting exciting !
it really is
yeah , right
not the study for test its study for myself with teacher who cares each students personally
no teacher's like that
there is

but her left eye is ...
