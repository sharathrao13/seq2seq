they've been bribed .
i got it out of nitti's coat .
where is nitti?
he's in the car .
this constitutes no evidence .
i'm not about to allow ...
your honour , the truth is that capone is a killer and he will go free .
there is only one way to deal with such men , and that is hunt them down .
i have .
i have forsworn myself .
i have broken laws i swore to defend .
i am content that i have done right .
that man must be stopped , you must ...
i'll be the judge of what i must do , mr ness .
would you excuse us?
bailiff .
yes , sir .
i want you to go next door to judge hoffman's court , where they've just begun hearing a divorce action .
i want you to bring that jury in here and take this jury to his court .

yes , sir , they're clear .
what's he talking about?
bailiff , i want you to switch the juries .
your honour , i object !
