he was busy .
he was chickenshit .
maggie , you're sick .
i'm not sick .
you're sick .
you can't operate .
they've rescheduled for monday .
an elective valve , no big deal .
it is unprofessional , and it embarrasses me in front of my staff .
i saw the chart on balford .
i'm on the committee .
it's on review .
it wasn't your fault .
i know .
then what's the problem?
i don't know .
you put up a terrific fight .
we fight for people's lives , right?
don't you ever wonder who it is we're fighting with?
so i'm crazy and chemically imbalanced .
you're tired .
you have moments .
why didn't you call me?
because i never sleep when you stay over .
you never sleep whether i stay over or not .
you're good .
you know it .
come back monday and get back on the horse .
doctor?
i'll see you .
as i walk along the stony shore of the pond in my shirtsleeves ....
... amazon basin in the north , once an island sea ....
the highest truth on the subject remains unsaid ... ... probably cannot be said .
for all that we say is the far off remembering of the intuition ... " " ... she begins to pull away from the awareness she had once ....
commencing search . " searching my soul .
what happened to the cards?
you could touch the cards .
she's been looking at me for half an hour .
maybe if ljust hang here ....
this is a delicious evening , when the whole body's one sense ....
what if i screamed?
what if ljust screamed right now?
when a woman decides to sleep with a man ....
you knew there would always be a spring ... ... as you knew the river would flo w again after it was frozen .
when the cold rains kept on and killed the spring ... ... it was as though a young person had died for no reason .
all right , they have rescheduled the operation for monday .
what happened yesterday?
they had a golf tournament .
who knows with these people?
good morning , mr. messinger .
the " g " is soft , like " messenger .
what's on your lip?
what?
am i slobbering here?
where did you get that?
what am i , a prisoner?
you want to get well , or you want ben & jerry's?
this operation is a big deal .
continue to eat like this . . .
. . . and you might as well skip it .
save the 30 grand .
if you'd have performed the operation yesterday like you were supposed to . . . . . . i'd be sucking carrots through a straw in my arm .
what happened?
circumstances were not optimal for the procedure .
i ain't " the procedure . " my name is nathan messinger and i'm right here .
hello , hello , hello . . . .
floating , floating .
don't pop it .
don't pop it !
do you know the muffin man , the muffin man , the muffin man?
hi , anne .
what are you doing here?
i was on my way up to x ray . . . . . . and i thought i'd stop in and just . . .
. . . hide .
from what?
i should've gone into pediatrics .
oh , no .
every guy you meet is either married or a gyno .
never date a man who knows more about your vagina than you do .
poor little guy .
he never stops crying .
what's wrong with him?
no insurance .
found him in a dumpster behind the house of pies .
we worked him up the wazoo for everything . . . . . . from drug exposure to diabetes .
we got nothing .
may l?
did you do an ultrasound?
you hear a murmur?
worth a shot .
okay , baby .
so what are you hiding from?
my patient's wife .
she wants me to tell her that her husband is going to be okay . . . . . . and that i have every confidence . . .
. . . and i don't .
and after all this time , and after all this work . . . . . . i suddenly have this feeling that . . .
. . . none of this is in my hands .
nothing .
and if it isn't . . . . . . what do i do with that?
excuse me .
are you a visitor?
yes .
visiting hours have been over since 8 : 00 .
why do they have that?
what?
hours .
doesn't it help the patient to be visited?
who are you visiting?
mr. messinger?
right now?
you .
i don't need a visitor .
you're not ill?
no .
i'm one of the doctors here .
are you in despair?
i lost a patient .
you did everything you could?
i was holding his heart in my hand when he died .
then he wasn't alone .
yes , he was .
people die .
not on my table .
people die when their bodies give out .
it's my job to keep their bodies from giving out .
or what am i doing here?
it wasn't your fault , maggie .
i wanted him to live .
he is living .
just not the way you think .
i don't believe in that .
some things are true whether you believe in them or not .
how did you know my name?
what's yours?
seth .
you better get out of here , seth . . . . . . or security's going to think you're a psych patient .
where are we?
down a liter .
suction .
i am stuck on band aid brand 'cause band aid's stuck on me
no dying now , mr. messinger .
not until you give me seth 's phone number .
i am stuck on band aid brand 'cause band aid's stuck on me
those eyes .
the way he looked ... ... right down into me .
seth .
what kind of name is seth?
i thought you'd be here .
salty .
my transplant tanked at 2 a . m .
you okay?
you might want to return this .
that part about the spring?
you knew there'd always be a spring .
how did you know that . . .?
what?
i didn't give you this book .
you didn't?
where'd you get it?
hi .
i'm a physician , and i think a patient left that in my office .
can you tell me who checked it out?
i can't tell you who .
i can tell you when .
all right , give me 5 minutes .
hello , maggie .
it's nice to see you again .
it's weird to see you again .
weird is nice .
you like hemingway?
yeah , i'm starting to .
may l?
as i ate the oysters with their strong taste of the sea . . . . . . and their faint metallic taste . . . . . . as i drank their cold liquid from each shell . . . . . . and washed it down with the crisp taste of the wine . . . . . . i lost the empty feeling . . . . . . and began to be happy .
he never forgets to describe how things taste .
i like that .
do you come here a lot?
i live here .
what do you do?
read .
no , i mean , your work .
i'm a messenger .
what kind of messenger?
a bike messenger?
no , i'm a messenger of god .
got a message for me?
i already gave it to you .
did you use my pager?
i usually don't get my messages unless you beep me .
you've definitely been beeped .
how is messinger?
he's good .
the operation went really well .
it was a good day .
it was .
yeah , i didn't kill anybody today .
you're an excellent doctor .
how do you know?
i have a feeling .
that's pretty flimsy evidence .
close your eyes .
it's just for a moment .
what am i doing?
you're touching me .
touch .
how do you know?
because i feel it .
you should trust that .
you don't trust it enough .
let's go somewhere .
where?
i don't care .
what do you want to do?
anything .
what's that like?
what's it taste like?
describe it .
like hemingway .
well , it tastes like . . . . . . a pear .
you don't know what a pear tastes like?
i don't know what a pear tastes like to you .
sweet . . . . . . juicy .
soft on your tongue .
grainy . . . . . . iike sugary sand that dissolves in your mouth .
how's that?
it's perfect .
the first time i looked in a microscope , i knew i wanted to be a doctor .
okay , let me have your hand .
what for?
we'll take a look at your blood .
not a possibility .
men .
i suppose you know a woman's threshold of pain . . . . . . is 9 times higher than a man's .
take a look at that .
that's bright .
that's me .
all those cells .
that's all you are .
that and all the space in between .
if this is all you are . . . . . . these cells . . .
. . . then when they die , that's the end .
i don't know .
i think so .
how do you explain it?
what?
the enduring myth of heaven .
i used to think that i had it all figured out .
but you didn't?
no .
because something happened in my o. r. and i got . . . . . . this jolt .
i got this feeling that there's something . . . . . . bigger out there .
something bigger than me , bigger than you , and it . . . .
does that sound crazy?
no .
i couldn't fix him .
i did everything right . . . . . . and i couldn't fix him .
that's not supposed to happen .
and l . . . .
you cried .
yeah .
why do people cry?
what do you mean?
i mean , what happens physically?
tear ducts operate on a normal basis to lubricate and protect the eye .
when you have an emotion , they overact and create tears .
why?
why do they overact?
i don't know .
maybe emotion becomes so intense . . . . . . your body just can't contain it .
your mind and your feelings become too powerful .
your body weeps .
i have to go .
i got to go .
stay right here .
don't go anywhere .
stay right there .
get the tube out .
he can't breathe .
it's because the tube is blocked .
how you feeling?
ready to hit the waves .
i'm afraid your bodysurfing days are over .
you got a mean tattoo going there .
what does your wife think of that?
that is my wife .
check his vitals every 1 5 .
i can't see you , but i know you're there .
go back and tell them that i'm not going .
not yet .
where have you been?
oh , shit .
i totally forgot dinner .
dinner?
with who?
a guy i met .
i bumped into him and we got something to eat .
did you pack my backpack?
what else?
we talked . . . . . . and then i got beeped and he disappeared .
why did you pack my backpack?
earl , what are you doing?
i thought we'd fly up to tahoe , use your uncle's cabin . . . . . . maybe do a little hiking .
what?
god .
is it . . .?
maggie , it's just a tick .
get a match .
we're not going to burn him , jordan .
it'll have to back out .
can't leave the head in .
we can't just be burning tick heads .
then get some alcohol .
i don't have any .
you don't have any alcohol?
i don't operate here .
how about some olive oil?
which kind?
jalapeo or rosemary?
rosemary .
so what did you and your friend what did you say his name was?
seth .
what did you two talk about?
dying .
come on , we deal with life and death every day .
why can't we talk about it?
i hope you won't become a surgeon who prays in the o. r.
can we talk for a minute?
we'll talk while camping .
jordan , i can't go camping now .
we need some time together .
all right , let's see if we can just spend 5 minutes .
let's see if we can just stand still together for 5 minutes .
doing what?
just being here .
i'll get the trail map .
no , i mean it .
nothing but us .
what do i do?
just look at me .
you can't do it .
you can't do it .
you flinched .
you lose !
you cheat .
that old black magic called ... ... love .
thank you very much .
welcome back .
we've been talking to mothers who are members of the kkk .
you want to watch anything?
me neither .
how do you know when i'm here?
i know .
jeez , you look good .
i forgot how good everybody looked .
30 years of silence .
you got guts , kid , showing yourself like that .
i appreciate that .
i do .
it'll make it easier .
i got to tell you , i feel fine .
you might want to check your orders . . . . . . because i sure don't feel like i'm dying .
you're not dying .
right .
then how come you're hanging around my room all the time?
i'm the only one with his ass hanging out of his dress .
unless . . . .
could it be . . .
. . . the doctor?
sure .
the doctor .
she's pretty .
a little flat chested . . . . . . but all you need's a handful .
who are you?
this is good .
this is what they call . . . . . . " serendipitous .
look that up in the dictionary , you'll see a picture of you and me .
thank you .
you ready to deal?
because i can answer all your questions , friend .
how's the french toast?
fabulous .
set me up .
guess i should introduce myself .
come on , give me your hand .
put it in mine .
there you go .
a little tighter .
tighter .
there you go .
no , that's too much .
there you go .
good grip .
nathaniel messinger .
glutton , hedonist . . . . . . former celestial body , recent addition to the human race .
i don't believe you .
you want proof?
you hang out at a library .
you can speak every language .
you travel with the speed of thought . . . ... and you're reading my mind right now .
stop that .
you're doing it .
it's impossible .
some things are true whether you believe them or not .
how?
you choose .
choose?
to fall to earth .
you take the plunge , the tumble , the dive .
you jump off a bridge .
leap out a window .
you just make up your mind to do it and you do it .
you wake up all smelly , and aching from head to toe . . . . . . and hungrier than you've ever been . . . . . . only you have no idea what hunger is or any of that stuff . . . . . . so it's all real confusing and painful , but very , very good .
human .
he gave these bozos the greatest gift in the universe .
you think he didn't give it to us too?
which gift?
free will , brother .
free will .
couldn't get a job .
no past , no training .
no l . d.
then one day , i was walking past a building site .
a skyscraper .
and i thought , " i could do that .
you see , these people down here . . . . . . a lot of them are afraid of heights , you know what i'm saying?
that makes me uniquely qualified .
and besides , it feels like a little bit of home up here .
and i like what i do .
i'm good at it .
these things'll kill you .
are there others?
others like you?
yeah , they're out there .
you see them , but most of the time you just walk on by .
nobody likes to think of the old life .
you know , what they gave up .
then why'd you do it?
my daughter , ruth . . . . . . her stupid husband , frank . . . . . . and my grandkids .
petie's 4 , hannah's 6 .
and this is my wife , teresa .
did you . . .
. . . tell her who you were?
i started to try once or twice .
then i thought , " why do that to her?
do what?
it's too much for them .
people don't believe in us anymore .
do they still gather together at sunrise?
and sunset , yes .
take me there?
can you hear it?
no .
i can't hear that !
but you can't feel this !
nathan !
you have to go back .
not until i catch the big wave .
wait .
wait .
wait for what?
swim !
and then you just . . . . . . fall .
fall?
dive .
you make up your mind to do it . . . . . . and you do it .
and when you wake up , you're . . .?
yes .
to smell the air .
taste water .
read a newspaper .
to lie .
through your teeth .
to feed the dog .
touch her hair .
what are you waiting for?
there is so much beauty up here .
yes .
here you are again .
we'll release your friend messinger tomorrow .
that's good .
his family's having a kind of a welcome home party .
will you be going?
will you be going?
this is earl .
he told me .
what else does he tell you?
he worries that you never sleep .
and he loves to see you smile .
sometimes i think earl's the only one who understands me .
what about your boyfriend?
do you love him?
love?
i don't know .
what does that mean?
i was hoping you could tell me .
it's a word . . . . . . that describes a chemical react
it's just crap .
i'm full of crap .
i wait all day , just hoping for one more minute with you . . . . . . and i don't even know you .
what do you want to know?
why you wear the same clothes all the time .
why won't you give me your phone number?
are you married?
no .
are you homeless?
no .
are you a drummer?
why don't you ever touch me?
i don't want to hurt you .
