you cannot pass !
gandalf !
i am a servant of the secret fire , wielder of the flame of anor .
go back to the shadow .
the dark fire will not avail you , flame of udn !
you shall not pass !
no !
no !
gandalf !
fly , you fools .
no !
gandalf !
gandalf !
what is it , mr. frodo?
nothing .
just a dream .
mordor .
the one place in middle earth we don't want to see any closer .
and it's the one place we're trying to get to .
it's just where we can't get .
let's face it , mr. frodo , we're lost .
i don't think gandalf meant for us to come this way .
he didn't mean for a lot of things to happen , sam ... ... but they did .
mr. frodo?
it's the ring , isn't it?
it's getting heavier .
what food have we got left?
let me see .
oh , yes .
lovely .
lembas bread .
and look !
more lembas bread .
i don't usually hold with foreign food ... ... but this elvish stuff , it's not bad .
nothing ever dampens your spirits , does it , sam?
those rain clouds might .
this looks strangely familiar .
it's because we've been here before .
we're going in circles .
what is that horrid stink?
i warrant there's a nasty bog nearby .
can you smell it?
yes .
i can smell it .
we're not alone .
the thieves .
the thieves .
the filthy little thieves .
where is it?
where is it?
they stole it from us .
my precious .
curse them , we hates them !
it's ours , it is , and we wants it !
this is sting .
you've seen it before ... ... haven't you , gollum?
release him or i'll cut your throat .
it burns !
it burns us !
it freezes !
nasty elves twisted it .
take it off us !
quiet , you !
it's hopeless .
every orc in mordor's going to hear this racket .
let's just tie him up and leave him .
no !
that would kill us !
kill us !
it's no more than you deserve !
maybe he does deserve to die .
but now that i see him , i do pity him .
we be nice to them if they be nice to us .
take it off us .
we swears to do what you wants .
we swears .
there's no promise you can make that i can trust .
we swears ... ... to serve the master of the precious .
we will swear on ... ... on the precious .
gollum .
gollum .
the ring is treacherous .
it will hold you to your word .
yes ... ... on the precious .
on the precious .
i don't believe you !
get down !
i said , down !
sam !
he's trying to trick us .
if we let him go , he'll throttle us in our sleep .
you know the way to mordor?
yes .
you've been there before?
yes .
you will lead us to the black gate .
merry !
merry !
what is it?
what do you smell?
man flesh .
aragorn .
they've picked up our trail .
let's move !
their pace has quickened .
they must have caught our scent .
hurry !
come on , gimli !
three days and nights pursuit .
no food .
no rest .
and no sign of our quarry , but what bare rock can tell .
not idly do the leaves of lrien fall .
they may yet be alive .
less than a day ahead of us .
come .
come , gimli !
we're gaining on them !
i'm wasted on cross country .
we dwarves are natural sprinters .
very dangerous over short distances .
rohan .
home of the horse lords .
there's something strange at work here .
some evil gives speed to these creatures .
sets its will against us .
legolas !
what do your elf eyes see?
the uruks turn northeast .
they are taking the hobbits to isengard .
saruman .
the world is changing .
who now has the strength to stand against the armies of isengard ... ... and mordor?
to stand against the might of sauron and saruman ... ... and the union of the two towers?
together , my lord sauron ... ... we shall rule this middle earth .
the o ld world will burn in the fires of industry .
the forests will fall .
a new order will rise .
we will drive the machine of war with the sword and the spear ... ... and the iron fists of the o rc .
we have only to remove those who oppose us .
the horse men took your lands .
they drove your people into the hills to scratch a living off rocks .
murderers !
take back the lands they stole from you .
burn every village !
it will begin in rohan .
too long have these peasants stood against you .
but no more .
othain !
othain !
you take your sister .
you'll go faster with just two .
papa says othain must not ride garulf .
he is too big for him .
listen to me .
you must ride to edoras and raise the alarm .
do you understand me?
yes , mama .
i don't want to leave .
i don't want to go , mama .
freda , i will find you there .
quickly !
go , child .
rohan , my lord ... ... is ready to fall .
thodred .
your son is badly wounded , my lord .
he was ambushed by orcs .
if we don't defend our country , saruman will take it by force .
that is a lie .
saruman the white has ever been our friend and ally .
grma .
grma .
grma .
orcs are roaming freely across our lands .
unchecked .
unchallenged .
killing at will .
orcs bearing the white hand of saruman .
why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind?
can you not see?
your uncle is wearied by your malcontent ... ... your warmongering .
warmongering?
how long is it since saruman bought you?
what was the promised price , grma?
when all the men are dead , you will take your share of the treasure?
too long have you watched my sister .
too long have you haunted her steps .
you see much , omer , son of omund .
too much .
you are banished forthwith from the kingdom of rohan ... ... under pain of death .
keep breathing .
that's the key .
breathe .
they've run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them .
we're not going no further ... ... until we've had a breather .
get a fire going !
merry !
merry !
i think we might have made a mistake leaving the shire , pippin .
what's making that noise?
it's the trees .
what?
you remember the old forest , on the borders of buckland?
folk used to say there was something in the water that made the trees grow tall ... ... and come alive .
alive?
trees that could whisper ... ... talk to each other ... ... even move .
i'm starving .
we ain't had nothing but maggoty bread for three stinking days .
yeah !
why can't we have some meat? !
what about them?
they're fresh .
they are not for eating .
what about their legs?
they don't need those .
they look tasty .
get back , scum !
carve them up !
just a mouthful .
no !
looks like meat's back on the menu , boys .
pippin .
let's go .
go on .
call for help .
squeal .
no one's going to save you now .
pippin !
a red sun rises .
blood has been spilled this night .
riders of rohan ... ... what news from the mark?
what business does an elf , a man and a dwarf have in the riddermark?
speak quickly !
give me your name , horse master , and i shall give you mine .
i would cut off your head , dwarf ... ... if it stood but a little higher from the ground .
you would die before your stroke fell .
i am aragorn , son of arathorn .
this is gimli , son of glin , and legolas of the woodland realm .
we are friends of rohan and of thoden , your king .
thoden no longer recognizes friend from foe .
not even his own kin .
saruman has poisoned the mind of the king ... ... and claimed lordship over these lands .
my company are those loyal to rohan .
and for that , we are banished .
the white wizard is cunning .
he walks here and there , they say ... ... as an old man hooded and cloaked .
and everywhere , his spies slip past our nets .
we are no spies .
we track a party of uruk hai westward across the plain .
they have taken two of our friends captive .
the uruks are destroyed .
we slaughtered them during the night .
but there were two hobbits .
did you see two hobbits with them?
they would be small .
only children to your eyes .
we left none alive .
we piled the carcasses and burned them .
dead?
i am sorry .
hasufel !
arod !
may these horses bear you to better fortune than their former masters .
farewell .
look for your friends .
but do not trust to hope .
it has forsaken these lands .
we ride north !
it's one of their wee belts .
we failed them .
a hobbit lay here .
and the other .
they crawled .
their hands were bound .
their bonds were cut .
they ran over here .
they were followed .
the belt !
run !
tracks lead away from the battle ...
... into fangorn forest .
fangorn?
what madness drove them in there?
did we lose him?
i think we lost him .
i'm going to rip out your filthy little innards !
come here !
trees .
climb a tree .
he's gone .
merry !
let's put a maggot hole in your belly !
run , merry !
little orcs .
it's talking , merry .
the tree is talking .
tree?
i am no tree !
i am an ent .
a tree herder .
a shepherd of the forest .
don't talk to it , merry .
don't encourage it !
treebeard , some call me .
and whose side are you on?
side?
i am on nobody's side ... ... because nobody's on my side , little orc .
nobody cares for the woods anymore .
we're not orcs !
we're hobbits !
hobbits?
never heard of a hobbit before .
sounds like orc mischief to me !
they come with fire .
they come with axes .
gnawing , biting , breaking , hacking , burning !
destroyers and usurpers !
curse them !
no !
you don't understand .
we're hobbits !
halflings !
shire folk !
maybe you are ... ... and maybe you aren't .
the white wizard will know .
the white wizard?
saruman .
see?
see?
we've led you out .
hurry , hobbitses .
hurry !
very lucky we find you .
nice hobbit .
it's a bog .
he's led us into a swamp .
a swamp , yes , yes .
come , master .
we will take you on safe paths through the mist .
come , hobbits !
come !
we go quickly .
i found it .
i did .
the way through the marshes .
orcs don't use it .
orcs don't know it .
they go around for miles and miles .
come quickly .
soft and quick as shadows we must be .
there are dead things !
dead faces in the water .
all dead .
all rotten .
elves and men and orcses .
a great battle long ago .
dead marshes .
yes .
yes , that is their name .
this way .
don't follow the lights .
careful now !
or hobbits go down to join the dead ones ... ... and light little candles of their own .
frodo !
gollum?
don't follow the lights .
gollum !
mr. frodo !
are you all right?
so bright .
so beautiful .
our precious .
what did you say?
master should be resting .
master needs to keep up his strength .
who are you?
mustn't ask us .
not its business .
gollum .
gollum .
gandalf told me you were one of the river folk .
cold be heart and hand and bone cold be travelers far from home
he said your life was a sad story .
they do not see what lies ahead when sun has failed and moon is dead
you were not so very different from a hobbit once .
were you?
smagol .
what did you call me?
that was your name once , wasn't it?
a long time ago .
my name .
my name .
smagol .
black riders !
hide !
hide !
come on , frodo .
come on !
quick !
they will see us !
they will see us !
i thought they were dead .
dead?
no , you cannot kill them .
no .
wraiths !
wraiths on wings !
they are calling for it .
they are calling for the precious .
mr. frodo !
it's all right .
i'm here .
hurry , hobbits .
the black gate is very close .
orc blood .
these are strange tracks .
the air is so close in here .
this forest is old .
very old .
full of memory ... ... and anger .
the trees are speaking to each other .
gimli !
lower your ax .
the white wizard approaches .
do not let him speak .
he will put a spell on us .
we must be quick .
you are tracking the footsteps of two young hobbits .
where are they?
they passed this way the day before yesterday .
they met someone they did not expect .
does that comfort you?
who are you?
show yourself !
it cannot be .
you fell .
through fire ... ... and water .
from the lowest dungeon to the highest peak ... ... i fought with the balrog of morgoth .
until at last i threw down my enemy ... ... and smote his ruin upon the mountainside .
darkness took me ... ... and i strayed out of thought and time .
stars wheeled overhead ... ... and every day was as long as a life age of the earth .
but it was not the end .
i felt life in me again .
i've been sent back ... ... until my task is done .
gandalf .
gandalf?
yes .
that was what they used to call me .
gandalf the grey .
that was my name .
gandalf .
i am gandalf the white .
and i come back to you now ... ... at the turn of the tide .
one stage of your journey is over .
another begins .
war has come to rohan .
we must ride to edoras with all speed .
that is one of the mearas ... ... unless my eyes are cheated by some spell .
shadowfax .
he is the lord of all horses ... ... and has been my friend through many dangers .
my home lies deep in the forest ... ... near the roots of the mountain .
i told gandalf i would keep you safe .
and safe is where i'll keep you .
the trees have grown wild and dangerous .
anger festers in their hearts .
they will harm you if they can .
there are too few of us now .
too few of us nets left to manage them .
the black gate of mordor .
oh , save us .
my old gaffer would have a thing or two to say if he could see us now .
master says to show him the way into mordor .
so good smagol does , master says so .
i did .
that's it , then .
we can't get past that .
look !
the gate .
it's opening !
i can see a way down .
sam , no !
master !
i do not ask you to come with me , sam .
i know , mr. frodo .
i doubt even these elvish cloaks will hide us in there .
now !
no !
no !
no , master !
they catch you !
they catch you !
don't take it to him .
he wants the precious .
always he is looking for it .
and the precious is wanting to go back to him .
but we mustn't let him have it .
no !
there's another way .
more secret .
a dark way .
why haven't you spoken of this before?
because master did not ask .
he's up to something .
are you saying there's another way into mordor?
yes .
there's a path ... ... and some stairs .
and then ... ... a tunnel .
he's led us this far , sam .
mr. frodo , no .
he's been true to his word .
no .
lead the way , smagol .
good smagol always helps .
edoras and the golden hall of meduseld .
there dwells thoden , king of rohan ... ... whose mind is overthrown .
saruman 's hold over king thoden is now very strong .
my lord , your son ... ... he is dead .
my lord?
uncle?
will you not go to him?
will you do nothing?
be careful what you say .
do not look for welcome here .
oh , he must have died sometime in the night .
what a tragedy for the king ... ... to lose his only son and heir .
i understand .
his passing is hard to accept .
especially now that your brother has deserted you .
leave me alone , snake !
oh , but you are alone .
who knows what you've spoken to the darkness ... ... in the bitter watches of the night ... ... when all your life seems to shrink .
the walls of your bower closing in about you .
a hutch to trammel some wild thing in .
so fair .
so cold .
like a morning of pale spring ... ... still clinging to winter's chill .
your words are poison .
you'll find more cheer in a graveyard .
i cannot allow you before thoden king so armed , gandalf greyhame .
by order of grma wormtongue .
your staff .
you would not part an old man from his walking stick .
my lord , gandalf the grey is coming .
he's a herald of woe .
the courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late ... ... thoden king .
he's not welcome .
why should i welcome you ... ... gandalf stormcrow?
a just question , my liege .
late is the hour ... ... in which this conjurer chooses to appear .
lthspell i name him .
ill news is an ill guest .
be silent .
keep your forked tongue behind your teeth .
i have not passed through fire and death ... ... to bandy crooked words with a witless worm .
his staff .
i told you to take the wizard's staff .
thoden ... ... son of thengel ... ... too long have you sat in the shadows .
i would stay still if i were you .
hearken to me !
i release you ... ... from the spell .
you have no power here ... ... gandalf the grey .
i will draw you , saruman , as poison is drawn from a wound .
wait .
if i go , thoden dies .
you did not kill me ... ... you will not kill him .
rohan is mine .
be gone .
i know your face .
owyn .
owyn .
gandalf?
breathe the free air again , my friend .
dark have been my dreams of late .
your fingers would remember their old strength better ... ... if they grasped your sword .
i've only ... ... ever served you , my lord .
your leechcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast !
send me not from your sight .
no , my lord !
no , my lord .
let him go .
enough blood has been spilt on his account .
get out of my way !
hail , thoden king !
where is thodred?
where is my son?
simbelmyn .
ever has it grown on the tombs of my forebearers .
now it shall cover the grave of my son .
alas that these evil days should be mine .
the young perish and the old linger .
that i should live ... ... to see the last days of my house .
thodred's death was not of your making .
no parent should have to bury their child .
he was strong in life .
his spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers .
they had no warning .
they were unarmed .
now the wild men are moving through the westfold , burning as they go .
rick , cot and tree .
where is mama?
this is but a taste of the terror that saruman will unleash .
all the more potent for he is driven now by fear of sauron .
ride out and meet him head on .
draw him away from your women and children .
you must fight .
you have 2000 good men riding north as we speak .
omer is loyal to you .
his men will return and fight for their king .
they will be 300 leagues from here by now .
omer cannot help us .
i know what it is you want of me ... ... but i will not bring further death to my people .
i will not risk open war .
open war is upon you , whether you would risk it or not .
when last i looked ... ... thoden , not aragorn , was king of rohan .
then what is the king's decision?
by order of the king ... ... the city must empty .
we make for the refuge of helm's deep .
do not burden yourself with treasures .
take only what provisions you need .
helm's deep .
they flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight .
who will defend them if not their king?
he's only doing what he thinks is best for his people .
helm's deep has saved them in the past .
there is no way out of that ravine .
thoden is walking into a trap .
he thinks he's leading them to safety .
what they will get is a massacre .
thoden has a strong will , but i fear for him .
i fear for the survival of rohan .
he will need you before the end , aragorn .
the people of rohan will need you .
the defenses have to hold .
they will hold .
the grey pilgrim .
that's what they used to call me .
three hundred lives of men i've walked this earth , and now i have no time .
with luck , my search will not be in vain .
look to my coming at first light on the fifth day .
at dawn , look to the east .
go .
you have some skill with a blade .
those without swords can still die upon them .
i fear neither death nor pain .
what do you fear , my lady?
a cage .
to stay behind bars until use and old age accept them .
and all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire .
you're a daughter of kings ... ... a shieldmaiden of rohan .
i do not think that would be your fate .
thoden will not stay at edoras .
it's vulnerable .
he knows this .
he will expect an attack on the city .
they will flee to helm's deep ... ... the great fortress of rohan .
it is a dangerous road to take through the mountains .
they will be slow .
they will have women and children with them .
send out your warg riders .
hey , stinker , don't go getting too far ahead .
why do you do that?
what?
call him names .
run him down all the time .
because .
because that's what he is , mr. frodo .
there's naught left in him but lies and deceit .
it's the ring he wants .
it's all he cares about .
you have no idea what it did to him ... ... what it's still doing to him .
i want to help him , sam .
why?
because i have to believe he can come back .
you can't save him , mr. frodo .
what do you know about it?
nothing !
i'm sorry , sam .
i don't know why i said that .
i do .
it's the ring .
you can't take your eyes off it .
i've seen you .
you're not eating .
you barely sleep .
it's taken hold of you , mr. frodo .
you have to fight it .
i know what i have to do , sam .
the ring was entrusted to me .
it's my task .
mine !
my own !
can't you hear yourself?
don't you know who you sound like?
we wants it .
we needs it .
must have the precious .
they stole it from us .
sneaky little hobbitses .
wicked .
tricksy .
false .
no .
not master .
yes , precious .
false .
they will cheat you , hurt you , lie !
master's my friend .
you don't have any friends .
nobody likes you .
not listening .
i'm not listening .
you're a liar and a thief .
no .
murderer .
go away .
go away?
i hate you .
i hate you .
where would you be without me?
gollum .
gollum .
i saved us .
it was me .
we survived because of me .
not anymore .
what did you say?
master looks after us now .
we don't need you .
what?
leave now ... ... and never come back .
no .
leave now and never come back .
leave now and never come back !
we told him to go away .
and away he goes , precious .
gone !
gone !
gone !
smagol is free !
look .
look .
see what smagol finds?
they are young .
they are tender .
they are nice .
yes , they are .
eat them .
eat them !
you'll make him sick , you will ... ... behaving like that .
there's only one way to eat a brace of coneys .
what's it doing?
stupid , fat hobbit .
it ruins it .
what's to ruin?
there's hardly any meat on them .
what we need is a few good taters .
what's taters , precious?
what's taters?
eh?
po ta toes .
boil them , mash them , stick them in a stew .
lovely , big , golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish .
even you couldn't say no to that .
oh , yes , we could .
spoil a nice fish .
give it to us raw ... ... and wriggling .
you keep nasty chips .
you're hopeless .
mr. frodo?
who are they?
wicked men .
servants of sauron .
they are called to mordor .
the dark one is gathering all armies to him .
it won't be long now .
he will soon be ready .
ready to do what?
to make his war .
the last war that will cover all the world in shadow .
we've got to get moving .
come on , sam .
mr. frodo .
look .
it's an oliphaunt .
no one at home will believe this .
smagol?
we've lingered here too long .
come on , sam .
bind their hands .
it's true , you don't see many dwarf women .
and in fact , they are so alike in voice and appearance ... ... that they're often mistaken for dwarf men .
it's the beards .
this , in turn , has given rise to the belief ... ... that there are no dwarf women ... ... and that dwarves just spring out of holes in the ground ... ... which is , of course , ridiculous .
it's all right .
nobody panic .
that was deliberate .
it was deliberate .
the light of the evenstar does not wax and wane .
it is mine to glove to whom i will .
like my heart .
go to sleep .
i am asleep .
this is a dream .
then it is a good dream .
sleep .
arwen ...
where is she?
the woman who gave you that jewel .
our time here is ending .
arwen's time is ending .
let her go .
let her take the ship into the west .
let her bear away her love for you to the undying lands .
there it will be ever green .
but never more than memory .
i will not leave my daughter here to die .
she stays because she still has hope .
she stays for you .
she belongs with her people .
why are you saying this?
i am mortal .
you are elf kind .
it was a dream , arwen .
nothing more .
this belongs to you .
it was a gift .
keep it .
my lord?
she is sailing to the undying lands with all that is left of her kin .
what is it?
hma?
i'm not sure .
wargs !
a scout !
what is it?
what do you see?
warg !
we're under attack !
get them out of here !
all riders to the head of the column .
come on .
get me up here .
i'm a rider .
come on !
you must lead the people to helm's deep , and make haste .
i can fight .
no !
you must do this , for me .
follow me !
forward .
i mean , charge forward .
make for the lower ground !
that's it !
go on !
stay together !
bring your pretty face to my ax .
that one counts as mine !
stinking creature .
