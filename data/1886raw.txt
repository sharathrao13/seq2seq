just get rid ofhim , roxy .
let him divorce me .
i can't stop him .
but i will never divorce him .
i'd think you would want to be free of him .
and let him marry his slut?
no .
tou have a choice .
tou can accuse charles henri of adultery and make him pay what he should .
why did we have to meet here?
tou always liked to come here and watch gennie on the carousel .
of course .
but i didn't realize it would be so cold .
tou know , i've been thinking about names .
what do you think of henri luc?
is it a boy?
did you have one of those tests?
no , i'd never do that .
it's like peeking at your present before christmas .
roxy , you should know this .
the lawyers say that if you don't agree to a mutual consent , no fault divorce ... you might not be allowed to use my name .
and our children?
naturally , they would be de persand .
i have to have the same name as my children .
french court usually awards custody to the french parent .
tou can't do this .
tou can't destroy your own family .
it is you who are destroying me .
after everything you've said about freedom of the individual to live and love .
it was only words with you .
empty words .
yes , it was .
i didn't realize that when you really love ... there's no freedom at all .
except to die .
come on .
no more dramatics , please .
just think about what i told you .
bonjour .
bonjour .
do you have this in blue?
is blue denim okay?
i'm magda's husband .
magda .
tou know , the other woman .
she's screwing your husband .
don't be another dumb american bitch .
tou should do something about it .
excuse me .
if you don't , i will .
we could do it together .
go away .
we could do the same thing they're doing .
we could screw each other !
come on !
stay away from me !
roxy .
hey , rox .
roxy?
rox?
hello?
hey , rox .
ro ...
roxy .
roxy?
roxy?
oh , my god .
roxy .
roxy !
it's good .
it's good .
sorry , we're full .
we have to hurry .
i just thought ...
i needn't take any more of this .
and what about gennie?
what about everyone in santa barbara?
of course they'll blame me , and they're absolutely right .
god , i should have looked after you better .
that's what i'm supposed to be here for .
not to pursue some love life of my own .
no .
that's what i want is for you to be happy .
even if i'm not .
baby's fine .
did they tell you?
and he's kicking like hell .
so beautiful .
mmm .
thank you .
what do you think of the name henri luc?
for the baby?
mm .
um , bertram .
a women's thing .
something to do with the baby .
no , not a miscarriage .
i'll call you back .
hugues .
mm mmm .
thibault?
i don't want any of those kind of names .
matthieu .
maybejust luc is better than henri luc .
i'm still thinking about names .
any ideas?
i don't know how you could do this to all of us .
could you not at least have thought of the baby?
i did .
i thought ... do i really wanna bring him into this world?
into a broken home?
so now , like everyone else , you're blaming me .
no .
i blame myself ... for coming up with the wrong answer .
oh , look at that color .
i should have brought you some .
i thought of it , but i was so terribly upset .
it's too bad .
i'm sorry .
i'm not defending charles henri .
he has behaved badly .
like a lot of husbands .
but leaving a pregnant wife ... is in bad taste .
the bad taste was to marry her .
those girls are not like us .
we can't teach them savoir vivre , good manners .
they find it ridiculous .
they only trust their instinct .
their feelings .
and where does it lead?
uncontrolled emotions .
desire .
and now my idiotic brother ... is fooling around with the sister .
she's also capable of slicing open her veins .
it's not my problem .
it's his wife's .
i have my hands full with charles henri and his american .
i expect the worst from his cossack .
charlotte , you know how to behave .
it's a question of self control .
how i hate letting oneself go !
at least you don't end up in the hospital .
rog .
roger .
hey !
oh , wow !
hey .
welcome to france .
is !
tou look great !
where's your aunt isabel?
tou look so french .
hi , daddy .
i do?
oh !
oh !
oh , my god !
hi , honey !
hi , baby .
look at you !
oh , my ...
how is she?
how's roxy?
she's fine .
yeah?
just don't talk about it .
please don't remind her .
just forget it ever happened .
i'm gonna forget that my daughter tried to kill herself?
all right .
that's why i'm asking you .
is looks like somebody out of tie me up , tie me down .
i wouldn't know .
i never saw tie me up , tie me down .
my god , you're huge !
darling .
tou look great .
champagne , please .
champagne .
diet coke , please .
that's alcohol .
tou're pregnant .
i'm not forbidden to drink .
french pediatricians tell you just the opposite .
is tourtire some kind of turtle thing?
no , it's a baked dish .
like a quiche but better .
the tourtire is the actual dish they bake it in .
what's the legal angle on the painting?
where do we stand?
in division of marital property , roxeanne's ex husband can claim one half ... and that includes one half of whatever is her share of the painting .
there'll be five of you claiming it , after all .
one can make that case in a french court it's communal and not marital property .
the first thing we have to do is get an estimate of the value of the painting .
can you drink the tap water here?
this isn't istanbul or cairo .
why is everybody drinking bottled water?
for the same reason they drink it in california , roger .
yeah?
yeah .
let's get some bottled .
monsieur , can we get some eau?
avec gas?
merci .
du i'eau , s'll vous plat .
well , we certainly do not want anything of ours going to charles henri .
tou know , it's funny , but i never trusted him .
never mind about that .
but come on , when we all first knew him , he was beautiful .
tou said so too , mother .
like orpheus , his stubbled cheek , a field of gold .
tou said that?
yes , i did .
could we be serious andjust talk about the painting for a minute?
the painting belongs to roxy because she cared enough about it to take it with her .
she had our blessings , as in everything .
right , margeeve?
i don't think we should sell it .
i think we should lend it to museums .
everyone can see it .
we can still keep it with our name on a golden plaque .
no way .
can't you guys see ...
i mean , the situation has completely changed now .
why , because it's worth more money than you thought?
well , that is a consideration .
i mean , right now , we're a family of five .
but one day , there'll be more of us .
there'll be kids and so on .
no one wants to deprive them of their inheritance .
roxy's the only one who has kids now .
roger , marry one of those girls you're forever moving in with .
they all seem terribly nice .
it's so not even what we're here to talk about .
come on , roger .
give it a whirl .
please .
of course saint ursula belongs to all of us .
i never thought of her as just mine .
tou know that , roger .
she was always there , hanging above the sofa , watching all of us .
yes , with a disapproving face , inhibiting us from whatever we wanted to do on the couch .
i suppose that's the way of all saints in the presence of human frailty .
let's say we divide the proceeds of the sale among the five of us .
how do we get around roxy's husband?
even if he claims one half of roxy's share ...
i'll make sure it comes back in alimony and child support .
oh , wouldn't that be wonderful?
just kidding .
as it is , i can't get a cent out ofhim .
in all fairness , everything he has is tied up in family trusts .
and with his paintings , he earns about as much as i do with my poetry .
i was even thinking of getting a job .
what?
we'll have to stake claims for monthly payments .
i'll need you to sign papers .
i'll stop by the office .
no , i'll bring them to your apartment tonight .
french lawyers are so nice .
can you imagine an american lawyer dropping off some papers at night?
no , i can't .
how do you want that cooked?
could i just get a steak au poivre and a salade verte?
trs well .
very well done .
all right .
oh , my god !
the tip must be included , yeah?
well , you leave something , anyway .
no .
that's the whole point of having the tip included , and it's 1 5 % .
just leave 20 euros .
well , maybe in a simple place , but in a place like this where you pay a fortune for lunch ...
nearly $900 , i might add .
goodness .
thank you , roger .
it's all i have .
the three of you are so gorgeous .
three peas in a pod .
roxy's all mine .
margeeve had nothing to do with her .
no , not much .
just raised her since she was two .
thanks , rog .
thank you .
oh .
i love that purse .
i want to go to that store tomorrow .
it's herms .
not on chester's salary .
how did you afford it?
she got it in a sale .
do you wanna borrow it?
tou can .
there's been some repainting .
ursula's left hand has been damaged .
it's quite possible the canvas has been cut down a bit on the right side .
also , the handmaiden's face looks a little weird to me .
is it a la tour?
what estimate?
no estimate yet .
i think the owners are deciding whether to sell at drouot or christie's in london .
when we thought it was coming for our show ... we put an insurance value on it of 40, 000 .
there must be something wrong if it's being sold modestly and with no fanfare .
no problem with the export license?
the louvre has passed on it .
i do think lorraine , around 1 640 .
i don't know .
if i may play devil's advocate ... the figures lack the weight , the monumentality of a la tour .
has your saint been fasting?
i don't think it would hurt for you guys to take a look at it .
let me say straightaway that i think your picture is superb .
marvelously beautiful .
thank you .
now , what do you suppose an oeuf fermier might be?
just boiled eggs , do we think?
only in france would they serve boiled eggs with such panache .
such effrontery , you might say .
i've explained the legal situation .
believe me ...
christie's is used to much , much worse .
'course , everything is worse when the french are involved .
hmm?
hmm?
i think i'm going to go for the liver with the pommes mousseline .
why don't you have something more cuisin?
tou don't have lunch in paris every day .
tou know what they do wonderfully?
the best is the pintade au cerfeuil .
and they do it with chestnuts .
it's excellent .
really?
hmm , that's a thought .
as to wine , i used to do wines , as a matter of fact , before i moved to old masters .
tou know , they say the real wine experts are all english .
yes , well , the french are distinctly faddish about wines , aren't they?
they overlook the most amazing vintages .
i suppose we ought really to have chteau la tour .
huh?
appropriate .
well , to my mind , your picture is from la tour's best period ... though not the period he's best known for .
but , in my opinion ...
la tour .
up until now , that hasn't been the general opinion .
no , but suppose you're a museum ... and wanted very badly to acquire a renoir , say ... that some local people had found in an attic .
well , you have to think of the psychology of the situation .
i mean , you're hardly going to tell the seller he has a renoir , are you?
the price would go out of sight .
tou'd end up paying a great deal more for it .
so , museums , to preserve their integrity ... often say they can't be sure .
see?
and what do you think?
i think your very fine la tour would ... in a competitive bidding , achieve a very fine price .
more than one person will know its value ... and our catalogue will state the case correctly .
what kind of price range are we talking?
perhaps a million pounds .
million and a half if we're lucky .
christie's will advise a reserve , which means it couldn't be sold for any less .
see , christie's , obviously , has an opposite point of view to the museums .
like you , we would want to sell for the maximum price .
we can be competent of our attribution and we know the market .
thank you .
oh , hey , dad .
chester walker , this is mr. janely from christie's .
professor .
mr. janely .
mr. janely is sure that it's a la tour .
really?
a million , dad .
a million pounds , not dollars .
that's a lot of money .
yes , to some people i suppose it is .
he was much younger then , but otherwise he's the same .
tou mean , personality wise?
no , i think i mean character wise .
i mean , there was always something about him .
worldly , knowing , a bit famous ... a bit old , which i suppose could be sexually magnetic .
especially to a young person , it's like fornicating with god .
where do these pretty things come from?
usually we beg in front of dior or st. laurent ... so that rich women on shopping sprees can expiate their sins .
why don't you just put that in the miscellaneous file for now?
i don't think we need it in tulsa .
so , you won't be coming to suzanne's lunch on sunday?
what can i do?
this conference was fixed up long ago .
i have to leave now .
i'm in the middle of packing .
don't you wanna meet my parents?
more to the point ... would they want to meet me?
i'm hardly the desirable young suitor they might have in mind .
don't you wanna see me?
naturally .
but if i don't leave now , i might miss my plane .
we'll meet on my return .
please make my apologies to your parents .
good bye , sweetheart .
bye .
do you really think it's the best idea for you?
one hardly has a choice , roxeanne .
tou know that .
well , i used to think so , but ... actually i found it's not true .
tou know , this morning i wrote a poem about the phalarope .
tou know those water fowl that bow as they swim along?
the most polite birds in the world .
very stately .
bowing as they swim along ... to no one in particular , just in courtesy ... in gratitude .
tou totally lost your mind .
they think of saint ursula as part of my dowry .
dowry?
where do they get " dowry "?
what are we , in the middle ages?
no , france .
don't expect them to talk about any of this at lunch .
they talk about every taboo thing under the sun .
but money?
never .
never .
i wish we could stop talking about it too .
i don't want to eat anything weird .
i want to tell you ...
aunt amlie will be at lunch today .
uncle edgar's wife .
she has been summoned .
what am i supposed to do?
fight for him?
to say i love him and i'll never let him go?
do you think he's worth it?
but of course you americans are known to be fighters .
tou might even fight for something you don't really want .
i don't like sundays .
i'd have spotted her in a crowd of thousands .
oh , hello , margeeve . !
hello .
hello .
isabel .
and this is my sister in law , amlie cosset .
nice to meet you .
pleased to meet you .
chester .
and roger .
oh , roger .
i was forgetting you .
how was the trip?
it's a privilege for us to be welcomed here ... in your country , in your family , in your beautiful home .
oh , the privilege is all ours .
i'm sorry that my husband isn't here with us today .
not to mention mine .
my brother edgar , he's invited to many international conferences .
i believe he's in belgium today .
presumably .
i no longer ask .
we love both your daughters , roxeanne and isabel .
they're both so practical , so sensible .
roxeanne and isabel?
we think of the french as practical , rational .
voltaire and the age of the enlightenment .
thermidor .
but not our girls , i'm afraid .
not much rationality there .
i hunt .
hunt?
do you hunt?
no .
what do you hunt?
the deer .
the deer .
i guess you shoot them .
oh , no .
birds are shot .
but the deer we hunt with dogs .
it's very beautiful .
the horses , the dogs , the hunters in their coats .
the cleric comes to bless the dogs .
the idea is to run the noble stag to the ground .
he becomes exhausted and can no longer run .
what happens after that?
then the dogs kill the stag .
we have the expression " another kill .
that's what that refers to .
do people ever get killed?
fall off their horses or something?
well , not usually , but it can happen sometimes .
oh , good .
so it evens out the odds a bit .
i suppose the moment's come to say never would i have imagined ... when i left santa barbara with just a few mementos of my own ...
this beaufort is not right .
it's off .
it has a smoky aftertaste .
it's inedible .
it's not right .
don't take it .
oh , this beaufort is not right .
but all is not lost .
the reblochon is perfect .
the beaufort really was disastrous .
yes , but the reblochon was excellent .
do you agree?
oh , everything was excellent .
tou have such a beautiful house .
and you run it so beautifully .
i really could take lessons .
oh , you are too kind .
there is something a little delicate i would like to mention ... while the others are not here .
and i really feel we can talk together quite freely as mothers .
and quite intimately as friends .
where is it?
tomber .
i got it .
tomber .
to fall .
to throw , as in wrestling .
to fall to the ground .
to tumble .
god , four years of french , i can't remember a thing .
tomber .
tomber .
that's what suzanne de persand called her brother .
it is an older man taking advantage of a young girl .
and guess who's the young girl .
it's our own flower ...
isabel .
oh , don't give me that " this is my life" stare .
it is her life .
that's ridiculous .
i don't believe it .
have i met him?
no , neither have i.
oh , wait .
it gets better .
then his own wife says that we must save isabel from being hurt ... by a man who is , and i quote , " a little unscrupulous ... where young women are concerned .
that's your fault .
she's got that daddy complex thing .
nonsense .
i've seen plenty of our students ... falling for their old professors or someone ... but those girls were all weak and clinging types .
everything that isabel is not .
does the fact that our families know spoil it for you?
no .
i was thinking of you .
and of your wife .
inhibiting perhaps , but not absolutely fatal .
we will ignore what they told your mother as if they had not told her .
i'll be going to concepcin for a couple of months to help with the negotiations .
can't i come with you?
sweet .
will you still want me when you come back?
isn't it your emerson who said ...
every hero becomes a bore at last "?
i have to go and get dressed .
it's getting late .
will you lock up?
mm hmm .
hello , edgar .
good to see you .
oh , very nice .
do you like that?
mm , a va .
are we both on the same errand?
are we both buying gifts?
could it be for the same person?
mine is a thank you , farewell gift ... because she's just finished helping me with all my papers .
what about yours?
mine is only a thank you gift .
didn't you give me a scarf too?
at the end , i mean .
a purse at the beginning , a scarf at the end .
tour situation was quite different .
tou were not ... forgive me ... a vulnerable young person .
oh , no .
i was older and married and divorced and two children .
tou were worldly , experienced and already famous .
it wasn't very difficult for you to forget me .
yes , i forgot you .
not the tears i shed for you .
may i?
yes , it is charming .
why don't we both give her the same scarf?
then she can come back and exchange it and get what she wants .
good idea .
i'll take it .
me too .
good .
good .
i never actually married a frenchman .
all my husbands were american .
only the lovers , as you know .
to me , a lover ... someone i truly love , would be more important ... than somebody i happened to sign a marriage certificate with .
lovers are a pastime one tends to outgrow .
a hobby ... that finally becomes a bore .
tou mean , in the end , " every hero becomes a bore "?
emerson .
someone quoted that to me ... when he was trying to extricate himself .
it suits you .
we're not just buying tampons and lipsticks , but all kinds of products ... shampoo , moisturizer , eye shadow ... you name it .
we're planning on buying three new trucks if all goes well .
and we're thinking of calling ourselves the saint ursula foundation ... in honor of our patron saint .
what do you think?
wait .
would we be tax exempt?
i have so many other questions .
what about my question?
my divorce hasn't gone through , as you well know .
so far , nobody's filed a single paper yet .
i don't know what the delay is .
come on .
i can hardly take up with a new husband ... before the old one's disposed of .
what's going on?
someone died .
who?
they won't let us in .
let me through .
i live here !
shooting at futurama .
a man fired at his russian wife and got away .
he is american .
a crime of passion .
there are no crimes of passion in america .
they all kill for money or drugs .
what's your perfume?
" honteuse . " by charmez .
i like it .
very subtle .
tou'll have your own money now .
tou can do whatever you want .
but as far as i'm concerned , my favorite thing in paris is this purse you gave me .
well , it suits you better than me .
yeah , it's too middle aged for you .
and too ladylike , i might add .
stop .
s'll vous plat .
stop .
i apologize .
tou must have done this a thousand times .
never .
okay , sweetie .
the boys begged me and then they gave up .
excuse me .
the eiffel tower , created at the turn of the century ...
the eiffel tower , created at the turn of the century ... by engineer gustave eiffel .
hey , that's my foot .
who's the guy you let by?
he said he lost his wife .
okay .
what's he doing?
he lost his wife .
he's running after her .
are you sure he's not running away?
he's in pretty good shape .
by the way , how are celine and the kids?
they're fine .
then i went to the garbage cans .
do you know who it is?
i won't go back !
there's a man's leg sticking out .
what's going on?
some guy who lost his wife .
he's pretty high strung .
by the way , how are celine and the kids?
they're fine .
here he comes .
something's up .
i'm alerting the guards .
there's a suspicious man on the loose , looking for his wife .
he's tall , early 40s , blond ... with a burberry style raincoat .
tea !
he has a gun !
armed man on the eiffel tower .
i repeat , armed man .
what am i looking at?
oh , there .
goodness !
i warned him .
i gave him a chance to stop .
i warned him .
all units . !
secure the third level . !
the door is blocked .
calm down .
drop your gun and unblock the door .
keep your cool .
stay calm .
don't hurt them .
we're here to help .
where's roxeanne?
why isn't she here?
i have to explain it to her .
i have to tell her why i did it .
is she coming?
should we wait for her?
please respect others .
we repeat ...
i loved magda .
i loved my magda .
magda's his wife .
now look at me .
look what i've done .
did you hurt your wife?
she deserved it .
so did he .
the caretaker identified the body .
who is it?
mr. de persand .
i'm sorry .
that's impossible .
my husband hasn't lived here in months .
just sit here for a while .
i'm a little tired .
if you give yourself up , you can ask to be extradited to america .
where's roxy?
listen , when you get home , all they'll do is order a psychiatric evaluation .
i need to see a therapist .
oh , no !
how ...
how did he die?
tell me !
maybe you can tell us .
we need to know .
let's go to the station .
it's quieter .
mr. bertram can come along .
can't you see she's in labor?
help her .
mama !
he put it down .
just get rid of it .
put it in your bag and throw it over the side so no one will ever find it .
throw it over the side .
tou'll hit someone with it !
hey , mom , hand me your bag .
will you please tell roxy that i'm sorry?
why won't people let me talk to her?
tellman got to see a therapist all right .
he was sentenced to 20 years in one of those nice french jails yves told me about .
and when edgar came back from his negotiations ... we had the last of our fancy private lunches .
so , you'll be staying in paris then?
i resigned from the commission .
i can't be so far away and leave my sister alone .
and roxeanne?
the baby has been very comforting .
roxeanne and gennie are crazy about him .
guess what .
loaf of bread press wants to publish an entire collection of roxy's poems .
apoet and a widow .
tou're aware that in france a widow is a hallowed person .
what about a mistress?
she's , uh , tolerated .
and adored .
isabel , you're young , you're beautiful , you're wise .
and , as we said before , i'm much too old for you .
car is waiting to take me for a tv interview .
it's live , which is always stressful .
in a heated moment , i may say something that later i would regret .
yeah , that is stressful .
the driver could drop you anywhere .
come on in .
tou know , it's true .
tou are too old for me .
but we had a pretty good time .
of course .
and think of everything we learned from each other .
for example ... how beautiful it is to be young .
so , good bye , uncle edgar ... and good bye , kelly bag and edgar's other gifts .
i'm sure he's still buying kelly bags at herms for other dumb girls like me ... but i got over him .
so , i took suzanne's advice to go with life as it unrolls .
prends la vie comme il vient .
tou've arrived .
next up is lot 5 1 .
georges de la tour .
la tour .
a lapse of attention on the part of the louvre .
yes .
it's come in now .
the saint's hand has been repainted , as has the servant's face .
the top of the painting was trimmed , as was the right side .
do i hear two million?
two million .
two million .
i have a taker .
2 .
1 million .
2 . 2 million .
2 . 3 million .
2 . 4 million .
2 . 4 million .
2 . 5 million .
two million , five .
2 . 7 million .
should we come in at three?
three million .
she's come in now .
three four .
3 . 6 million .
we're in at three six .
three eight .
3 . 9 million .
we're at four .
that's our ceiling .
four three .
we've passed our ceiling .
tou sure?
4 . 5 million .
at four five .
are you sure?
it's your last chance .
it's hers .
it's hers .
can't win 'em all .
congratulations .
what about taking my foot?
it means , " did you have fun?
of course .
didn't you?
who would have ever thought " taking my foot " ... means " to have fun in bed "?
c'est ridicule .
