what is it?
my boy's not well .
what?
fire !
let's go !
i'll get permission to kill him .
wait !
only he can kill the one .
so ...
he's just a monster .
we can't trust him .
this is 01 .
request permission to kill .
tsugumu ...
connect me to captain kurashima .
i must know if the wife and son are okay .
tsugumu !
mrs. maki !
over there .
how is tsugumu?
he's in there .
he's still unconscious .
i'm sure he'll make it .
he's his dad's son .
right?
yes !
thank you .
but ... my boy has a congenital blood disease .
if it's a case of that ...
mrs. maki ...
you must believe he'll make it .
that's right .
he'll be okay .
he sensed his son was ill , and fled .
he'll go there .
t he goes there , what'll you do to him?
you don't need to know that .
an alarm's been given .
the army's evacuating inhabitants .
it's like shinjuku is under marshal law .
what are you thinking?
if i fight him ...
i might die .
please .
let me see my son .
just one glance .
let him go .
ten minutes .
no more .
understood .
maki !
mister !
maki !
i'm sorry .
yoko ...
how's tsugumu?
his blood is normal .
there are no other unusual symptoms .
why'd he faint then?
probably psychological fatigue .
we'll keep him overnight and leave him on a drip .
excuse me .
he's still such a small kid .
tsugumu ...
i'll stay with you .
i won't go anywhere .
i'm okay .
go to work .
tsugumu ...
never mind my work .
it does .
flying a plane has been your dream .
i like the sky , too , so go to work .
i'll try to get better , too .
then you'll give me a ride in your plane .
will you promise?
i promise .
shunichi ...
even it we quarreled ,
i smiled when you went off to fly .
i always tried to do so .
now go .
be careful .
i will .
goodbye .
if you didn't return , i was going to kill the one myself .
even if i had to die .
when his tail was cut in pieces , we used them to develop poisonous bullets .
i'm not sure if they work .
but it's worth trying .
when you talk about him , you stifle your emotions .
is that your " supernatural power " again?
i don't know .
just feels that way .
udo ... was my lover .
we'd have married .
we'd have had a family like yours , too .
a common but warm family .
at that laboratory ...
i couldn't kill him .
are you ... going to kill me?
my mistake killed many people .
i'll get him this time .
no .
that's ... my job .
what kept you so long?
are you under the colonel's orders?
that's right .
let's go .
hold it .
your mistake killed many of my men .
i can't let you go .
no more victims , but we need his help .
just one more time ... trust us .
stand by for now .
he's absorbed many creatures ... and developed himself .
what a grotesque form he must have ...
i can't even imagine .
tell me .
what?
i still have my conscience .
what about him?
weren't we affected by the same light?
no .
he was affected by a different light .
two different lights .
he got the bad one .
he was unfortunate .
it makes no sense , but it's fact .
but , chances are ...
sara ...
why are you here ...?
i woke to find ...
i'm here .
tell me , what happened to me?
i knew it .
he still has human consciousness .
it's just a monster using his body .
who is he?
sara , where ... am i?
you are ... in heaven .
heaven?
that's right .
you are ... already dead .
sara , you shot five times , but hit me only once .
aim more accurately .
tears clouding your eyes?
stupid girl !
goodbye , my dear !
die !
you're in the way !
i'll kill you all !
you aren't human anymore .
i won't ... forgive you !
you're in the way !
what's that?
miku !
you okay?
you alright?
this way !
hurry !
i can fly .
i can fly in the sky !
it's amazing !
it has wings .
the monster is spreading its wings .
what a grotesque sight !
i don't know how to describe it .
it looks ike ...
like ...
demon ...
this is it .
30, 000 feet high .
all alone .
piercing through the air .
it's like i'm a light now .
i'm like ... a silver meteor .
burn !
burn all the humans !
is that all you got?
my power's fading .
why?
your merger ... isn't perfect .
you should've eaten humans like did .
you fool !
your body ... can't endure more fighting .
if i die ... what'll happen to you?
probably ...
i shall die with you .
what about the evil?
no !
i can't fall yet .
no !
i have a ... promise to keep .
i'll kill that evi .
that is my ...
last mission .
you still alive?
die !
don't shoot !
go round it !
maki !
how quiet .
will i die this time?
maki ...
i needed your life ... to fulfill my mission .
that's alright .
i realize now , meeting you was ... my fate .
fate?
we fighter pilots ... cannot choose our planes .
if our plane goes out of order ... we'll die , no matter how good we are .
but we regard that ... as our fate .
and we flew .
meeting you ...
i had the best flight ever .
so ...
i have no regrets .
are you sure ... you have no regrets?
just one .
i couldn't keep my promise to my son .
my regret is ... that i couldn't fly with him .
it's been a month since that nightmare .
but the remnants of destruction are still everywhere .
what impressed people more was that super human figure .
he killed the monster and left .
who on earth was he?
will he appear before us again someday?
ultraman .
see you later !
be careful !
amazing !
i'm really flying !
you like it?
yeah .
thanks for keeping our promise .
but ... it wasn't only me ... that helped to keep the promise .
what?
who else?
a friend of mine who went back to the sky .
a friend?
the silver meteor i dreamed of .
thank you ...
ultraman .
i like my dad as a pilot .
when i grow up ,
i'll become a pilot like him .
i want to fly in the sky , too .
that's my dream .
