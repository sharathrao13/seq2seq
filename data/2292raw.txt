calling all cars ...
partridge " sighted around 23 : 00 , cite gagarine .
short hair , moustache ...
goatee beard .
carrying a sports bag and a military knapsack in green canvas covered in doodles .
like a student 20 years ago .
with all that , you can 't miss him .
happy hunting and take care .
he knows we 're onto him .
the destruction of the law courts proves we can strike at will .
no member of the system is safe .
we demand our comrades 'release .
the popular army
still got nothing to say?
puma to base .
we're in place .
nothing doing .
we'll check out the building and get back to you .
i hear you , puma .

i said i've nothing .
let's look harder .
that way .

you never saw me , ok?
turn round , hands against the wall .
feet apart .
who's that?
her hubby .
he's a cop .
that's why nobody will sell to her .
orders .
whose orders?
i don't know and i don't want to .
i'll tell you .
it's a guy called jaquillat .
i want you to set up a meeting .
i have 2 tons of hash to sell .
cheap .
and who are you?
don't get smart .
the name's yvan .
how do i contact you?
you don't contact me .
i'll come by .
stay here for at least 10 minutes .
what the hell?
i told you to split !
what's wrong?
cops are all over .
you got a fallback?
what for?
i haven't done anything .
see you .
do we have to stay much longer?
you'll be fine with me .
i have to go .
not yet .
it's too soon .
i can't wait any longer .
i just can't .
wasn't there a syringe in the box?
i feel awful .
do a line .
it's not the same .
use his stash to shoot up later .
i dumped it .
i couldn't get stopped with it .
i have just enough for one fix .
i feel terrible .
let me go .
not just yet .
when?
soon .
it's you they're after .
do you have a place to go?
you can come to mine , if you like .
get me home and i'll hide you .
they won't look for you there .
my hubby's a cop .
you'll be safe .
he works all night .
it would be funny , huh?
want some?
don't look .
follow me , please .
inspector ...
your husband's more talkative .
we had a very interesting chat .
you're free to go .
what did you tell him?
nothing .
that we'd stayed in every night this week .
that you came straight home after school .
that we watched tv all night .
what you should've told him .
i had no reason to tell him anything .
you neither .
you'd still be there now .
as if i care !
they had us under watch .
is that normal?
it wasn't normal for you to be there one more day .
it wasn't for you to talk .
it's not your affair .
you have a kid now .
your choices are his affair .
he missed you .
he was confused .
what did you tell him?
you were at your mother's .
you lied to him .
i don't want lies .
i'll tell him the truth .
you have no right .
some day , he'll find out .
someone will tell him , at school or football .
if we lied , he'll think i was guilty .
he'll feel guilty , too .
i don't want him feeling guilty of anything .
i've done nothing wrong .
i'm not so sure about that .
i don't care what you think .
come on ...
wake up !
look at me ...
you're at home .
don't be afraid ...
you're at home now .
look at me ...
everything's okay ...
c'mon , stand up .
on your feet ...
hold onto me ...
come on ...
walk ...
let me sleep .
no , you can't sleep ...
help me , for christ's sake .
keep going ...
walk !
don't go to sleep ...
that's right , keep your eyes open .
that's good ...
can you see me?
can you hear me?
sit down but don't go to sleep .
hold on ...
look at me ...
now , talk ...
what's your name?
tell me your name .
can you remember?
see what he helped me avoid?
who?
my man .
he always gave me all the dope i needed .
since i met him , i never went cold turkey .
not once .
i'd forgotten .
15 years since i had to buy my own dope .
and this is the result .
he won't get any more?
why?
do you know why?
can you get me some?
c'mon , help me .
what's your name?
pierre .
thank you , pierre .
my saviour .
go out first and cross the road so i can see you .
if the coast is clear , fine .
if there's anything unusual , head one way then double back , neither fast nor slow , just walking normally .
okay?
meet you at 2 in the car park .
i'll probably be driving an orange audi .
very discreet .
watch how you go , matador .
hi there .
my meeting?
tonight , 1 1 pm .
place du barlet .
will jaquillat be there?
no , i will .
you pick me up and we go together .
tell me where to save time .
i don't know where it is .
he'll guide us on my mobile .
just give it to me .
i can't trust you with my mobile !
if you don't do exactly as he said , no deal .
ok , we do it his way .
you got any dope?
don't pull a gun on me , i won't have any for a while .
he didn't like me knowing his name .
you got me in the shit , no mistake .
don't worry , in 3 days he'll forget .
see you tonight .
shit !
you're fucking crazy .
sorry .
celebrating?
my release .
they grilled me all last night .
they beat you up?
'course not .
i didn't talk .
anyway , you know nothing .
they stopped tailing you .
did you know?
it shows they believed you .
see that?
your pupils got behind you .
yes , they're great .
try to get them to move .
encourage them .
pick out the good ones , i'll train them up .
are you kidding?
i'm not dragging my kids into all your crap .
it wasn't crap then .
well , now , i've changed my mind .
jean jean's dead .
did you know?
why didn't you say?
i thought you didn't care .
you know he was shot in the back?
does it matter?
you signed the geneva convention?
are you saying it wasn't your fault?
if that's why you're here , i think i got the message .
it's not that .
i know what i have to do .
i need a hand tonight .
it's important .
you won't be at risk .
it's just back up .
i said no .
i'm not interested .
the world's changed in 20 years .
maybe we were right but it's over .
nothing has changed .
the same oppressors , same oppressed .
the world hasn't changed .
you have changed .
be strong , we can't give up now .
i'm not going anywhere with you .
never will .
i won't help you , won't hide you , won't write a tract .
don't even ask .
don't ask me for anything .
i'm all alone , jeanne .
alone , they'll kill me .
why don't you go?
i'll get you to ltaly .
we can leave right now .
i'll do that , nothing else .
what is there for me in ltaly?
save your skin , that's the only thing worthwhile .
life's worth nothing .
it's what you do with it .
save your slogans for someone else .
i won't come .
i'm out of it .
it's none of my business .
you believe that?
i'm meeting the shit who gave us away .
he didn't give me away .
he didn't know you .
and those who did kept their mouths shut .
wanna know what they did to jean jean?
and andre?
and me?
do you?
why not?
none of your business?
if we'd talked , you wouldn't have a kid to raise .
don't forget it .
you'll be there tonight .
for jean jean and andre .
you owe them .
jean jean's dead .
andre's a thug .
prison is the only place for him .
take that back immediately .
i take back what i said .
i apologize .
say you don't really think that .
i don't really think that .
that's okay .
i'll forget what you said .
i'll pick you up at 10 : 45 .
it's my friend cecile's .
i said i'd met a guy .
you'll be safe here .
the car's yours?
no , it's hers .
i'm going to need one with valid documents .
i have to get it back to her today .
no sweat , i'll find one .
i'll rent you one , if you like .
that's an idea .
i'll take care of it .
what do you think?
it's perfect .
don't lose it .
i give hers back tonight .
don't worry .
where is he?
let me explain .
no point .
i know what's going on .
you've got it wrong .
i don't think i have .
alain ...
that's enough .
i know you're here .
i'm warning you .
i won't budge until i've seen you .
don't force me to look in the closet .
you must be cecile .
who are you?
pierre .
you didn't say he was moving in .
it's temporary .
get out .
listen ...
get out right now !
but he can't .
he's nowhere else to go .
he has no job , no welfare , nothing .
for months , he's had to beg .
tell that to pascal .
i'm sure he'll be delighted to offer him a bed .
now , out !
both of you .
you can't do this .
you'll use force?
come on .
what are we gonna do?
nothing .
you did the right thing .
stay calm .
she'll come to us .
i'm sorry .
i was a little ...
you can stay here , of course .
it's ok , we'll look after you .
what time you got?
ten to .
me , too .
bang on time .
i'll go .
okay .
who was it?
it's muriel .
she's run away again .
i'm not that stupid .
where are you going?
to fetch her .
i'll make up a bed .
no , i'll take her home .
don't wait up , i'll be some time .
drive .
what have you done?
you'll see in the paper .
you're okay .
you didn't get hit .
whose blood is it?
don't ask .
you killed him?
i'm going .
no , stay put .
there's no point me staying .
maybe not .
i need to think .
just do what i say .
steer clear of rue de la roche ...
i'll take care of the car .
make for ltaly .
good luck .
you can go .
how did you end up here?
owner's a well wisher .
that's not true .
i know who the owner is .
she's a colleague of mine .
it's not her style .
i know she's a colleague .
what do you think?
the group stops at those you know?
there's many more you don't know .
we even have a mole in the police .
he keeps me informed .
tomorrow , i'll have a new car and then i'll blow up police hq .
we've never been stronger .
the proletariat knows they'll always be exploited .
people are sick of it .
they want change .
and it will change .
they lay off 1, 000 workers , we kill one of the bosses .
redundancy will become rarer .
we were 15 years too early but now the masses are ready .
there are no masses .
that's your problem .
you live in a world of individuals and individualism .
go see where jean jean's mum lives .
the same problems as masses of others .
is her future brighter with jean jean dead?
she knows why .
she's proud of him .
i'm glad .
can the same be said of your victims?
they were class enemies .
3 firemen in chambery , a retired railworker in lyon , 2 bank clerks in vizille .
they're irrelevant !
not to me !
they got in the way , okay?
no , not okay .
i want to know why they died .
what for?
i want you to tell me .
get out .
you're on your own .
you'll get yourself shot , all for nothing .
fuck off !
i was scared , francis .
it's all over .
you're safe now .
come on ...
where is he?
he killed again tonight .
it wasn't him .
were you there?
you don't know then .
he denied it .
the radio said otherwise .
the radio always takes the cops 'side when the cops kill someone .
he's crazy .
completely crazy .
he's going to die and he's scared .
where is he?
no way .
where's my daughter?
you startled me .
where's my daughter?
i don't know .
she stole my car .
i know it was to come here .
where is she?
i haven't seen anyone , i swear .
i don't believe you .
i know who you are .
you're not homeless .
you were never agnes's lover .
you're her dealer .
pretty amazed , huh?
i know everything .
i know you're blackmailing pascal .
did he tell you?
mind your own business .
i haven't told him .
i wouldn't want him to beat you up .
even so ...
that's the least you deserve .
i'd be a tougher match than agnes .
what are you saying?
he beats her .
you never noticed how violent he is?
you didn't wonder why she wore shades yesterday?
she should have said .
it's not easy to talk about .
he'd better not see me .
come with me , i'm scared .
i'll be watching .
keep nice and composed .
he's not here .
it's empty .
i got it all wrong .
let's go .
having problems?
is that you?
don't be stupid .
alone?
what do you want?
i asked if you are alone .
okay , let's check .
hands in your pockets !
cool it .
i'll wait for jeanne .
make me some food .
shut up !
not a word out of you !
for christ's sake , what do you want?
do you want money?
a car?
want me to get you across?
in 2 hours , we can be in ltaly .
we'll play it your way but my boy will be home soon .
i prefer to wait for him .
i've nothing against you .
but try that again and i won't think twice .
get cleaned up and we'll tidy the house .
hurry , they're here .
i'll keep the gun out of sight for the kid but don't try anything .
hello , mister .
hello , young man .
did you cut yourself , dad?
go play in your room .
get out !
calm down .
shut up !
he's right .
calm down .
you can't stay .
'course not .
we're leaving together in your car .
we won't make it .
there are roadblocks all over .
they stop you?
i was with my son .
never .
you hear me?
never .
think it over .
either we go together , with me under a blanket and the kid in the back , and in 10 minutes it's all over .
or i shoot you both and take the kid .
you wouldn't .
you'd bet your life on it?
you're wrong .
more?
where do i take you?
i'll tell you .
get up .
move to one side .
that'll do .
why are you slowing down?
there's a roadblock .
where are we?
boulevard mendes france .
be very careful what you do .
i swear i won't try anything .
promise you won't hurt the boy .
i can't speak for the cops .
what's going on?
that's fine .
we're through .
take rue de sapporo .
we're on it .
all the way to the end and stop .
you see rue d'lnnsbruck?
any cops around?
okay , i'm gone .
what the hell?
don't panic , it's the kids 'safety .
you can relax .
you'll never see me again .
okay?
i'll be right back .
what do you want?
can i come in?
i know where he is .
i'm just waiting for the boys .
no , don't worry .
there's nothing more to fear .
yes , sweetheart .
big kiss .
i love you .
