good morning .
i m in a bit of a hurry to catch my flight .
congratulations , operation successful .
anita hans " sunk 120 miles outside maroco .
they've gotten carla , in geneva .
we found that the usual way .
it s been taken care of by our legal department .
why they arrested her?
she was carrying 150 grams of heroin .
they probably used her as a bate .
except she's ... she's ... what?
i m not gonna think the worst scenario .
while they were bothering with her arrest , someone passed 3 kilos of that .
where is colonel grace?
on a mission .
take some days off .
you worth it .
just let us know where you are all the time .
everything is gonna be all right .
congratulations for the mission . one more time .
it was really successful .
are you ok?
need anything?
can i stay for some days in your apartment?
you have any kinda problems?
i il get you out of here .
it s clear you've been a victim of a really bad joke .
150 grams of heroin sound like a really bad joke to you?
you have no criminal record .
you've been vacating in maroco with your husband .
you've never had any troubles .
you're not taking drugs , it's gonna come up at the blood tests .
not even the worst lawyer , would loose your case .
how long will this take?
not that much .
i m already working on your papers .
i ve found out how similar cases were handled .
so?
seven releases so far .
don't you worry .
we're right beside you .
it s me , i must see you .
i m here all the time .
how's loik?
i cannot find him anywhere .
he's probably on vacations .
i m coming by .
go .
we'll take care of it .
that's good news .
i talked to some people facing the same charges as you .
you won't be staying here much .
and what does that mean?
your employer wants you to do something , while you're here .
i m just carrying out the message to you .
her name is helena standler .
works for lipofski .
she was to be released next week .
you must kill her .
did the office plant the drugs into my suitcase?
i m just carrying out the message .
tell them , they can go to hell .
the police might go over to your .
they can find 10 kilos of heroin there .
i won't be able to help then .
you'll go to jail for 20 years at least . think of your parents .
don't bring my parents into this shit , you fucking asshole .
ok .
excuse me .
i wanna get some sleep .
i know .
why they didn't just say it , from the beginning?
helena standler works in the jail hospital .
she's got a good reputation , but you better be very careful with her .
everything is gonna be all right , you'll see .
so?
there was an american agent inside " anita hans " .
that's why they killed ramond .
we totally ignored them in maroco .
we drawn one of their own , so they had to kill one of our own .
we bothered them and not it came back to us .
will they stop here?
they're out of the game .
they worry about other shit .
i m worried about george .
first it was ramond , now lisa .
i don't know what you're planning on doing, but i just don't want him around .
i il find a new mission for him, somewhere far away .
ramond was drown at aspreto .
allright?
very well .
we're done .
hi .
i can't find the colonel .
they're sending me to train the commandos in sourinam .
trainer ... they can count on me .
loik , i need a favor .
just don't bother me with the office .
in everything else , i totally trust you .
george, what brings you here?
i il ask directly .
did you fraimed lisa?
double corbonatted soda . helps breathing skin .
cleans the toxines . wanna give it try?
for lisa , it was just orders to be followed .
why?
they had to get her .
i don't care about the rest .
you don't?
you know why we sunk that boat?
your whole life you've been tricking people . now it was your turn .
lf you wanted to have rules , being a secret agent was a mistake .
ramond is dead .
i did't know that .
we had to expect that from the americans .
it was a woman that killed him .
about i. 65 tall , blond with short hair .
you know maria menendez?
you should .
she's spanish , independent .
she has contacts with the americans .
we've spotted her at maroco with the guy at the embassy .
she works for whomever pays the most . interested?
she lives in madrid .
i il give her a place to live, if you want her . with great pleasure .
you ain't knocking, you may as well close the damn door .
you wanted to see me?
not me .
go to the first floor .
they are waiting for your report and your passport .
you haven't delivered yet .
i don't have it on me .
your mission was over in our last meeting .
you know what happens when someone oversees our rules .
what is that? a threat?
a warning .
i m working here a long time , so i know what's going on .
i don't even know who you are .
so don't go threatening me .
they want me to take care some woman in jail .
she's being released in 4 days .
helena standler . you know her?
no .
she's highly ranked in lipofski's organization .
why we won't wait for her to be released?
it would be simpler .
i don't get that either, but i don't have any choice .
you shouldn't be here .
stop .
when are you gonna see a lawyer?
do not get in trouble because of me .
hold on .
good evening .
espresso , please
thanks .
give me a cigarette .
cleansing and bandaging .
the pictures are from a motion sensitive camera .
switzerland is full of those .
that's him .
police gathered three burned bodies .
you supposed to send him somewhere far away .
what is he doing in switzerland?
he's alive .
seems so , but i m not sure if we must be happy about it .
what's his game?
is he interested in lisa?
he's feeling betrayed .
you're underestimating him .
is he or is he not a professional?
disobedience means betrayal .
you know that .
i have to pay the price .
we all have to .
it s me .
may i come in?
thank you .
may i use the printer?
over there .
can you bring the package i ve left you?
i m off to bed .
does it hurt?
no .
thank you .
perfect .
dizitalin .
powerfull , hearttonic ... bad also deadly for the healthy .
standler has the heart of a teenage girl .
me too .
i can have some too .
they've thought about that for sure .
and?
they're taking that risk .
they trust you .
why you are so afraid?
it s me , loik .
i hope you didn't do anything stupid .
i m glad you're here .
i wanted to talk to you .
three days ago none wanted to talk to me .
what's happening?
you didn't inform neither loik of myself .
ain't that a bit unusual?
swiss newspapers have intersting subjects .
he know lipofski and all of a sudden he wants to give him away .
he became a burdon .
to whom?
what do u expect?
geopolitical lesson?
law is the secret .
you can't be sensitive about it .
it s just a job .
we wanted lipofski in africa , but he got stubborn .
we had to proove to him that we're not joking .
we can't allow to standler or noone else to ruin everything .
jail was your idea?
i love lisa too much .
she's not gonna have any problems .
and if she's not cooperative?
we asked her to obey , not to cooperate .
lately you seem that you can't see the difference between those two .
what's your problem?
ethical? idealistic?
you had no second thoughts in killing that girl in madrid .
for the time being i ve blocked the investigation .
i wonder myself if there is any point in all these .
we all came to wonder that sometime .
but there is one thing i m certain of .
i wouldn't change this for the world .
i m talkin as a friend . there is a mission waiting for you .
it s not a fake one .
you have my word .
congratulations .
you did an excellent job .
come with me .
i il tell you something important .
you'll always be alone . that's the way it has to be, for an agent .
it s not a matter of courage only .
it s a matter of self preservation .
jump .
it s too high .
jump lisa .
you can do it .
otherwise you wouldn't be here .
jump .
why there's nothing left of my country?
you should've stayed there .
what's wrong with her?
her son died some days ago .
she just found out .
i il talk to her .
no .
come on, helena .
you want a glass of water?
yes, please .
here you are .
thanks .
we can't stay here all night .
bank of kuweit , luxemburg .
you french people are so expensive .
less expensive then you american people .
we don't mess in your business .
money is the essence of war .
i would be helping sick children .
mother teresa , dressed up in armani .
what's you gonna do with your agent and my troublemaker?
you're gonna keep them?
we are ready .
dasilve is tougher then me while working .
like a libanese man . and now he has taken charge of the whole country .
we're not businessmen .
we're deplomats .
ain't that the same thing?
lipofski . they're here .
do you speak portuguese?
a few .
nice . talk to him in english . he prefers that .
come with me .
about that ...
noone will be waiting for her once she goes out of jail .
may i introduce you my french friends .
sir james .
they sent me to take you back to france .
give it to me .
how do you feel?
