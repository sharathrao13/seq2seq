it's important .
nothing is important .
it is about an object .
what?
a necklace with a cross .
i'd forgotten about it .
i found it near the car .
i couldn't keep it .
that's stealing .
if you want to ask me something , i got there just after ...

i'm sorry .
i wanted to return the necklace ...
i wanted to ask you something too .
yes?
when i opened the door ... your husband was still alive .
he said ...
i don't understand .
he said " now try coughing .
he was telling us a joke .
it's about a woman who can't stop coughing .
she sees a doctor .
he examined her and gave her a pill .
she swallowed it .
and asked " what was it?
the most powerful laxative " .
a laxative for a cough?
yes .
try coughing now .
it made us laugh .
then the car crashed .
my husband always liked to repeat the punch line .
you returned it .
it is yours .
are you sick?
are you ok?
you always gotta hold onto something .
what did you say?
thank you .
for what?
i'm staying .
in order to throw me away , they had to collect signatures of all occupants .
your place is nice .
when i was a little girl , i had a lamp like this .
i'd stand under it and stretch out my hand .
i wanted to jump and touch it .
i forgot all about it .
where did you find it?
i found it .
souvenir?
do you live here alone?
yes .
i could never spend a night alone .
something must have happened .
you are not the type someone dumps .
forgive me , i talk too much .
poor guy .
who?
he was asleep there last night .
he's gone now but left the flute .
julie?
a coffee .
i searched everywhere .
and i found you .
nobody knows where i live .
it took a few months .
then i got lucky .
my cleaning lady's daughter saw you in the area .
i've come here ever since .

i am here for lucille .
you came .
forgive me .
i'm sorry .
are you angry?
no .
we are on in 5 minutes .
get me ready .
after i changed , i came here for a drink .
i looked around the audience , for no reason .
in the middle ... of the first row , i saw my father .
he seemed tired .
and sleepy .
but he was starring a girl's ass . the shithead who let you in wouldn't make him leave .
he told me , that if he pays , he has a right to watch .
i didn't know who i could count on .
i was desperate .
i didn't know who to talk to .
that's why i phoned you .
and your father?
10 minutes ago , he looked at his watch and left .
at 23 . 45 is the last train to montpellier .
why do you do this?
because i like to .
i think everybody likes to .
you saved my life .
i didn't do anything .
i asked you to come and you did .
no .
julie ...
isn't that you?
lucille , we are on .
it's me .
european council proposes you to finish the composition of patrice de courcy .
i agreed .
i am working on it now .
i'm trying to understand patrice .
it's not easy .
can you tell something about this score , shown here for the very first time?
it's the first part of the concert patrice composed , commisssioned by the european council .
the concert was to be played just once by twelve symphonic orchestras in the 12 eu cities .
patrice was a secretive man .
only his wife , julie , would understand him .
i tried asking her to participate in this program , but she refused .
i assume that these documents are from your archives .
no , they are not archives .
who can predict ...?
they are photos and documents which i found in his desk at the conservatory .
his wife didn't want them .
i am not sure i should show them .
he was a great man .
one of the most important composers of our time .
people like him belong to everybody .
i'll be five minutes .
where did i put it?
a green calling card .
did you watch tv today?
no .
i found it .
her number at home and at work .
why do you need this?
today , on tv , she showed the scores i took from you .
after the accident , when nothing was sure , i made a copy .
when you picked it up , i knew you'd destroy it .
i kept the copy and sent it to strasbourg .
why did you do that?
the music is so beautiful .
you can't destroy things like that .
olivier !
i'm sorry .
it's nothing .
i heard you're finishing patrice's concert .
i thought i could try ...
you can't .
you have no right .
it won't be the same .
i said i'd try .
i don't know if i'll finish .
i'll tell you why .
it was a way ... that's what i thought , to make you cry , run .
the only way of making you say , " i want " or " i don't want " .
it's not fair .
you didn't leave me any choice .
you have no right to .
you want to see what i've done?
i'm not sure i understood .
if i could play for you ...
do you know what the chorus sings?
i thought patrice had told you .
in greek , the rhythm is different .
who was that girl?
what girl?
in the photos on the program .
she was with patrice .
didn't you know?
just tell me , were they together?
yes .
since when?
several years .
where does she live?
near montparnasse .
they often met at the courts .
she is a lawyer .
or she works for one .
what do you want to do?
meet her .
excuse me .
what about equality?
is it because i don't speak french that the court won't hear my case?
excuse me .
yes?
you were my husband's mistress?
yes .
i didn't know .
i just found out .
it's a shame .
now you'll hate him , and me too .
i don't know ...
of course you will .
it is his child?
yes .
but he didn't know .
i found out after the accident .
i didn't want a child but it happened .
now i want to keep it .
do you have a cigarette?
you shouldn't .
do you want to know when and where?
no .
you want to know if he loved me?
yes , that was my question .
why ask , i know he loved you .
yes .
he loved me .
julie ...
will you hate me now?
come in .
what happened?
you met her?
once you asked me to take patrice's papers .
you didn't want to .
no , but if i had ...
the photos were among them?
yes .
if i had taken them , i'd have known .
and if i had burned them , i'd never have known .
that's right .
maybe it's better this way .
can you show me what you've composed?
these are violins?
the altos .
and now ...
wait a second .
lighter , without the percussions .
lets remove the trumpets .
instead of a piano ...
a flute?
flute ...
start back here .
that's as far as i got .
and the finale?
i don't know .
there was a paper .
the counterpoint was supposed to come back .
he told me , it is memento .
try weaving it back in .
van den budenmayer?
he wanted to allude to him at the end .
you know how much he loved him .
are you still in touch with our lawyer?
sometimes .
did he sell the house yet?
i don't know .
i doubt it .
he'd have called .
tell him not to .
if you can handle all this , will you show me?
yes .
there was a mattress inside .
mr olivier bought it .
i didn't think you would need it .
that's fine .
good morning .
have you been here before?
no .
never .
upstairs are the bedrooms and the office .
i'll show you them later .
this is the kitchen .
it's always been like this .
is it a boy or a girl?
boy .
have you chosen a name?
yes .
i thought ... he should have his name and his house .
do you still need me?
no , you can go home .
thank you .
i knew it .
what?
patrice told me a lot about you .
really? like what?
that you are good .
that's what you want to be .
people can always count on you .
even me .
i'm sorry .
it's me .
i finished .
come pick it up tomorrow .
or now , if you're not too tired .
i'm not tired .
but i will not come for the score .
what?
i won't pick it up .
i've been thinking it for a week .
this music can be mine .
a little heavy and awkward , but mine .
or yours , but everyone would have to know .
are you there?
yes .
you right .
it's me .
i wanted to ask you .
you really sleep on the mattress?
yes .
you never told me .
no i didn't .
do you still love me?
i love you .
are you alone?
of course i'm alone .
i am coming .
if i can talk like angel ,
and i have no love ,
i will be a copper ringing .
if i can prophesy
and if i have no love
i will be nothing .
love is patient .
love is kind .
it bears all things .
and knows everything .
love never ends .
prophecy gone .
if languages silent .
knowledge nothing .
prophecy gone .
languages silent .
and only stays
faith , hope and love
but the biggest one from this three
is love .
