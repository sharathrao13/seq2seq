hey , time out !
you remember that fella from hectic records?
he picked tonight to watch our set .
oh , fuckin '...
he liked it enough to give us our own showcase audition , one week from now .
that's what i'm talking about !
which means that we have one week to start acting like a professional band .
if you need lessons , feel free to talk to me .
i'll teach you a lesson !
oh , jeez , ok !
joseph macdonald?
edith's dead .

gunshot , patricide .
next !
kurt cobain !
shotgun , suicide .
next .
no , lan , did you say " patricide "?
yeah , marvin's old man gunned him down .
no , that's not patricide .
patricide is when you gun down your old man .
ok , minor technical detail .
fratricide .
no , no , no .
wrong again , all right?
fratricide is when you gun down your brother .
you're wrong , i'm right , so it's my turn .
mama cass .
asphyxiation .
dumb broad died choking on a ham sandwich .
bzzzt .
wrong answer .
chicken sandwich?
bzzzt .
wrong answer again !
who cares what kind of sandwich !
mama cass died of a heart attack .
urban legend , ham sandwich .
game over .
so how come you never told me you grew up on a farm?
there's not much to tell .
my mom took me away when i was a boy .
something about that farm we couldn't agree on .
what?
my father .
huh?
150 bucks?
are you crazy?
hey , never criticise a man until you walked a mile in his shoes .
then you can criticise him , cos you're a mile away and you got his fuckin 'shoes !
talking of which hey , carl , are we there yet?
yo , lan .
like i know !
mac , any of this look familiar to you?
vaguely?
open the door , already !
daddy's gotta pee !
oh , wow .
i'm ready to pick a little cotton for master , y'all .
got something against farm people?
no .
besides the fact that they lynched my ancestors , smell like cow shit , have sex with their cousins , invented country music , and they have two first names , like bobby joe , billy jean .
god .
oh , man , my hay fever .
that is so nasty !
jesus !
takes them a full 30 seconds to realise they ain't got a head .
chickens .
name's billy bob .
glad you could make it .
fuck off .
note to self farming not a career option .
your pa's waiting for you up at the house .
how did he know i'd come?
it's a real pity about your aunt .
yeah .
thanks .
yo , where you going with the homecoming queen , son?
i'd watch my step if i were you , boy .
oh , yeah?
why's that?
cos you're standing in horse shit .
oh , fuck off , god damn it !
all over my brand new kegs , goddamn !
hey , candy , go get me a kleenex or somethin '.
fuck all y'all , bastards .
none of your parents were married , you bitches .
perfect .
no signal .
you need a wider lens for that .
ah , you're jealous .
dream on .
hold it right there .
don't move !
now turn around slowly , boy .
you got a lot of nerve , intruding on a man's grief .
i bet i could pull this trigger right now and call it justifiable homicide .
now , who are you?
you know who i am , you invited me .
i'm your son , lorene's son .
ain't nobody mentioned that name on this farm in fifteen years .
my boy was taken from me .
far as i'm concerned he's dead .
now i'm not gonna ask you again who are you?
i'm joseph macdonald .
joseph macdonald .
that's right , boy .
and don't you ever forget it .
i was just yanking your chain .
well , come here , boy .
come on .
how 'bout a hug?
oh , look at you !
you're the spitting image of your grandpa !
god rest his soul , if he could only see you now !
i'm just here for the funeral .
that's all .
she ... just broke her heart that you never visited .
but i always said you'd come back .
i'll be gone again tomorrow .
guess it's her time to go .
can't argue when the good lord calls you home .
how was she called?
pardon?
aunt edith , h how did she die?
natural causes .
lord , bestow your blessing on this worthless band of sinners .
to everything there is a season
and a time to every purpose under the heaven .
a time to be born and a time to die .
a time to plant and a time to reap .
a time to kill and a time to heal .
shit , i hope my funeral has a bigger turnout .
a time to keep silence and a time to speak .
" a time of war and a time of peace ...
the devil has returned .
pardon me?
jethro , you look just like him .
you're not welcome here , jesse .
i've come to warn them .
i want you off my land .
keep reading , reverend .
a time to love and a time to hate .
it's started again , the harvest of blood .
i know , i can feel it .
your father's legacy of evil .
my daddy's dead .
you and the others took care of that .
yes , and burning for his sins !
a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing .
you will join him in hell !
get out of here , or so help me god !
holy shit !
jeremiah , no !
jeremiah !
no !
the sins of the fathers
shall be visited upon the children's children !
and the sword ...
shall be made drunk with their blood .
i commit edith macdonald to the blessed soil of the land she loved and cherished .
amen .
thanks for coming , gene .
sorry about what happened .
i just got upset and i guess i got carried away .
no problem .
do me a favour , keep an eye on those kids .
we don't want no pot smoking musicians spoiling things around here .
don't worry , it's all under control .
you working on any cases?
no , it's dead quiet .
don't fear the reaper !
now say you're sorry !
i'm sorry !
jesus !
you motherfucker !
so , what's for dinner?
best moonshine in the county .
i make it myself .
edith used to say , the two toughest things to swallow are pride and moonshine .
i can think of a third .
so , um , how do you make this stuff?
well , i could tell you .
but then i'd have to cut your throat and gut you like a pig .
just yanking your chain .
old family secret .
some things are better kept that way , right , son?
je ...
sir , this is a truly wonderful meal .
thank you .
to edith .
to edith .
may she rest in peace .
and to my son .
the last of the macdonalds who's finally been called home .
to me .
to mac !
and ...
the farm !
good , little lady !
the farm !
to old macdonald's farm !
are you ok?
yeah .
excuse me .
mac , man , what did i say?
i was just kinda goofing around .
you just reminded him of jethro .
who's jethro?
jethro macdonald .
my grandfather .
scared most people in this county half to death .
kids used to call him crazy old macdonald .
he's not still around , is he?
er , died about 14 years ago in a fire .
burned to death .
holy smoke .
so what did he do that scared people?
er ...
why don't you ask mac?
it's his granddaddy .
i don't remember .
was he some kind of axe murderer?
why don't you ask him yourself?
he's sitting right behind you , on the mantel .
my daddy ... was a man of vision .
people always fear what they don't understand .
he lived for this land ... and he died for it .
rest in peace , daddy .
i was just yanking your chains .
jethro's buried up on the hill with the rest of the family .
that old barn , after the fire i rebuilt it nail by nail , just like your granddaddy would have wanted .
why did you put me up here?
this used to be his room .
you ain't afraid of ghosts , are you?
should i be?
thought you might want these .
just so you know , after your mama took you away , i did write to you .
she sent every one of them back .
i'm not the monster you think i am .
tell that to the lady you almost killed with a shovel .
jesse?
don't pay her no mind , she's just crazy .
you could have killed her .
i lost my temper and i'm sorry , ok?
jesse hasn't been right in her mind since her husband passed away .
wasn't much right before that , neither .
she was talking about a harvest of blood .
old slave superstition .
sprinkle a little blood on the crops , get a better harvest .
blood?
chicken blood .
don't you worry about jesse .
you get some sleep .
i'll see you in the morning .
man !
wonder why a brother's gotta sleep on the couch?
when i'm famous , i'm gonna forget all these motherfuckers .
what the fuck is ...?
mmm .
i could get used to life on a farm .
oh , no , not again .
mm hm .
you only live once !
man , that must have been the weirdest funeral i've ever seen .
if you ask me , old macdonald belongs on a funny farm .
that's funny .
what's wrong?
i don't know .
this used to be jethro's room the attic .
you're kidding .
really?
i wasn't allowed in here when i was a kid .
that turns me on even more .
oh , yeah?
think of it as a threesome .
you , me and jethro .
what?
i don't know .
fine .
forget it then .
no .
come on , man .
... chicken .
come on , baby .
it's a farm , keith .
you're not supposed to shoot the rooster .
he started it .
where is mac?
his bed hasn't been slept in .
what?
you mean i slept on that fucking couch for nothing?
i guess so .
see , that's not cool .
yeah , fucker , i got you now , bitch .
what the hell are you doing out here?
we're almost ready .
oh .
i , er , i heard something .
i came down here last night .
i must have fallen asleep .
where is everybody?
getting ready .
and keith's about to use the rooster for target practice .
what's wrong?
nothing .
wanna talk about it?
you didn't seem too interested last night .
it's strange .
i feel my old self coming back .
so can i.
morning , jeremiah .
morning .
well , better get a move on .
i won't be able to guarantee the safety of that macdonald cock much longer .
women .
can't live with them , can't shoot them without good cause .
all right , bubba .
good luck on that reading thing .
all right .
cool .
that's fine .
gonna miss you , boy .
you gonna miss my ass , bubba gump .
let me guess .
we're going on a long trip .
not according to these .
well ...
you'll be back .
you're a macdonald .
it's in your blood .
civilisation , here i come !
here we go , kids !
just drive !
look !
somebody's gonna get lucky .
out of my face , bitch !
slut !
sweetie , i don't think you're a slut , you're nice .
could you just ...?
hey , carl , what the fuck's happening?
like he would know .
i can't believe this shit .
candy , get your ass off the bus .
go ahead , sweetie .
go ahead .
i checked it before we came , man .
i don't know what's wrong with it .
you don't know what's wrong , but i know what's right .
get some help .
be serious .
i'm serious !
better get to steppin '!
move !
punk ass !
you think we can push it?
your herculean ass can push it .
shake it , butt breath !
i wouldn't be out here if it wasn't for your dead ass auntie .
somebody get her some water .
hey !
woo hoo !
long time no see .
ok , everybody .
listen up .
i just talked to orwell down at the garage .
she says getting an injector pump for your bus shouldn't be a problem .
could take a little while , though .
wait a minute , what's a little while?
oh , two , maybe three days .
what?
i'm stuck here in redneck river valley without a ride?
the lord works in mysterious ways .
i have to get back to my job !
someone employs her?
i happen to be a professional .
which street corner?
hey !
hey .
she's a ... um ...
tarot card reader .
yeah .
in a shopping mall , ok?
what about our showcase?
yeah .
if you're looking to practise , you can set up in the barn .
ok , everybody , shift your pretty little asses .
we're moving the bus .
as long as you're staying , you mind giving me a hand?
carl , go help my dad .
actually , i was talking to you .
i could use your help .
so ... just the two of us .
save it , ass wipe .
get the shit in the barn .
ok .
$100 says you can't hit one .
my mama says i can hit all three .
watch .
who da man !
bring it on !
it's the sights , man .
the sights are off .
you want me to move them a little closer for you?
you think you can do better , bobby joe or whatever your name is?
go ahead .
bring your country ass up here .
there you go .
step up to the mike , go ahead .
woo hoo hoo !
yeah !
wow .
that's nice .
i prefer a shotgun myself .
comes in much more handy on a farm .
but i guess your kind wouldn't know too much about that .
my kind?
what do you mean , black people?
musicians .
that's what i thought .
feels good , don't it?
yeah .
land a man's born on it , a man's buried on it .
in between , you just gotta do what you gotta do to take care of it .
just what i said this farm needs .
a little new blood .
ergh !
yah !
i like that .
hold it .
aren't you forgetting something , rod?
like what?
your guitar break?
it's right after the third verse .
second verse .
what's the difference?
second verse , third verse?
it's rock'n'roll , it isn't carved in stone .
what's the difference?
you're screwing up the song .
i'm screwing up the song?
you've been two beats behind since we kicked it off .
fuck you , man !
what are you talking about?
he's right .
you were behind .
next you're gonna tell me i ain't got no rhythm .
yo , billy bob , was i two beats behind?
nope .
see?
you figure it out .
i gotta take a break .
what?
so you gotta feed the cows and the chickens?
excuse me .
you were a beat and a quarter behind .
i'm getting musical notes from sling blade?
all right .
bring your banjo over here and show me what you can do .
i ain't never played no banjo in my life before .
but ...
do you mind?
no , do your thing .
i don't sing but i do play a little organ in church on sundays .
you wanna tell me what's going on?
you wouldn't understand .
really .
now we have a communication problem .
whatever .
if you wanna bail on me , that's fine .
but not the band , we've worked too fucking hard .
the sooner we get off this farm , the better .
ow .
fucking shit .
fuck .
fucking cock sucking son of a fucking ...
ow , ow , ow .
yeah , and mac's acting really weird .
hey .
hey !
did any of you take my shoes?
i'm asking you if you took my shoes !
no !
fuck , that's what i thought .
fucking ow !
what's got stuck up his butt?
this is fucking hilarious .
this is country humour , huh?
look .
joke's on me , billy bob .
but the joke's over now , so just give me my shoes , all right?
come on .
what the hell you talking about?
you must be out of your goddamn mind .
listen to me !
i am through fucking around with you , you hear me?
now give me my goddamn shoes !
you think i stole your fancy shoes?
i wouldn't be caught dead in them .
you motherfucker !
i'm gonna count to three , you goat licking motherfucker .
and there ain't gonna be no four , you hear me !
one , two ...
how the fuck do you like it?
you like the gun pointed at your face?
fuck you !
fuck all of you .
i did not come here to kick it with the cows and the fucking roosters , mac , drink moonshine with johnny fucking cash , junior and senior .
is that right?
yes , that's right .
you can kiss my city ass goodbye cos i don't ever wanna see you again .
you're just as crazy as the rest of 'em , macdonald .
now you're talking about my family .
you know what , man?
i always thought i was your family .
i don't even know you any more , man .
go ahead , shoot me .
you can't leave .
you can't take billy bob's bike .
what about everything we're working for?
come on , keith , man !
we're in this together .
we're this close !
keith !
well , there goes our record deal .
motherfucker !
bet you think this shit is funny , billy bob .
inbred motherfucker .
goddamn , i hate the country .
you should have asked the wizard for some brains , asshole .
oh , yeah?
fuck !
oh , fuck !
fuck you !
you any good with those?
shuffle .
hm .
you have a strong , unfulfilled desire .
yeah .
to get the hell off this farm .
no .
this is something spiritual .
an ambition .
the band?
me?
hm .
the ten of swords .
so let me get this straight .
we're talking about manure .
the ancient aztecs knew how powerful this stuff really is .
cow shit .
are you sure the aztecs even had cows?
manure is the very essence of what we eat and who we are .
matter of fact , you're even smoking some of it right now .
are you crazy?
no , man .
i sprinkled a pinch of manure in there just before i rolled it .
aha !
the lovers .
not lately .
that's the opposing card .
what lies ahead , you'll have to confront .
the devil .
so what is this thing?
this , my friend ...
this is the most vicious farm machine known to man .
a thresher .
so what does it do?
it threshes .
look at these blades .
go ahead , feel for yourself .
you're full of shit .
fuck !
fuck .
you boys all right?
what the hell are you doing?
my job .
i always move the thresher to the south field before sunrise .
you could have killed us .
didn't see you there .
god damn it , what is that smell?
smells like , um ...
manure .
come on , let's get back to the house .
asshole .
gene .
jeremiah .
missed you at church this morning .
ain't gonna arrest me for it , are you?
hell , no .
but you missed a good sermon .
can't hide a wicked heart from the eyes of the lord .
sounds familiar .
book of jeremiah .
you here on official business?
sure am .
couple of kids disappeared last week on their way to a concert .
parents think something might have happened .
take a look .
maybe you seen them before .
oh , yeah .
these two .
buried 'em myself , over near the cornfield last week .
i'm just yanking your chain .
never saw 'em before in my life .
you know kids .
probably smashed up daddy's car and too afraid to go home .
yeah .
could be .
thought they were only staying the night .
bus broke down .
where's the black fella?
he got axed from the band .
huh .
listen , i got a little surprise for you , if you're interested .
hop in .
should we be here , dude?
metaphysical question , man .
you gotta bring that daughter of yours round more often .
yeah , i'll do that .
you know , one of these days i'll have to shut down that still of yours .
yeah?
well , why don't you keep these as evidence in the meantime?
take care .
you bet , gene .
bring that girl .
damn , that's good !
carl?
hey .
hey .
so , do you wanna tell me what's with all the cloak and dagger shit?
there's something weird going on here , suzie .
no kidding .
i'm serious .
listen to me .
i had a good look at that injector pump and it's clearly been messed with .
wear and tear didn't cause that breakdown .
you're saying someone's trying to keep us on the farm?
not someone mac .
why would he do that?
he's been acting so weird .
he doesn't want us to leave .
suzie , face it .
the only axe he's picked up since he got here is a real one .
he doesn't give a damn about the band any more , or about you .
you deserve better .
you know?
thanks , carl .
i never told you this but when i watch you ... up on stage , performing , something happens to me .
something ...
sorry .
damn it , carl , you're taping me again?
what is with you?
you fucking ... oh .
freak !
suzie , wait !
i didn't even know it was on .
suzie , wait .
oh , man .
note to self asshole .
an axe !
wait a minute .
what's that?
do you hear that?
hey , suze !
where have you guys been?
us?
we've been moonlighting .
moonshining .
harvest moonshining !
so where's mac?
who knows?
just like a man , never around when you need him .
we're here .
huh?
... and at that point , she went down on me .
uh !
shit .
carl , probably playing with himself .
my solo definitely sounds better in the second verse .
he's right .
nice guitar break .
he should turn that down .
jeremiah's gonna kill him .
wooo !
woo !
hey , carl , turn the music down !
thank you !
i can't believe this .
what the fuck happened here?
someone had a little party .
a party?
jesus !
somebody jimi hendrixed my axe !
i guess it was carl .
what?
carl did this?
last night .
he tried to get it on with me and ...
and this is how he deals with it .
trashing our stuff !
if i find him , he's a dead man .
damn right you are .
you gotta tell mac .
why bother?
come to pick out a plot for yourself?
most people say jethro shouldn't have been buried up here , with the rest of the macdonalds .
what's that supposed to mean?
hell , he's your granddaddy .
you know what he did .
or maybe you don't .
or maybe you just don't wanna remember .
why do you think your mama took you away from this place?
what do you know about the harvest of blood?
it was chicken blood on the crops .
chicken blood?
who told you it was chicken blood?
sheriff says a couple of kids are missing .
no one's seen jesse for days .
you ask me , someone's carrying on that old macdonald tradition .
harvest should be pretty good soon .
wait a second .
carl?
oh , my god !
it's time we had a talk about my grandfather .
this irrigation system , your granddaddy built it himself , saved this land from dying .
i don't give a fuck about that , i want to talk about him .
ok .
what do you wanna know?
what you've been avoiding .
avoiding?
i keep hearing he killed people .
i know what people say .
rumours .
thick as buttermilk round these parts .
you should know that .
could you hand me the monkey wrench?
candy , i think i've got it .
whoa !
can you hand me that flashlight?
bad vibes .
suzie !
suze?
suze?
this is fucked !
they're dead .
what's going on?
that basement hasn't been used in years .
slaves hid there before the civil war .
we'd better get the sheriff .
sheriff?
we don't need a sunday school lesson .
we need to get out of here !
calm down .
we all know what's going on .
it's him .
case closed .
whoa .
are you saying that i did this?
are you saying i killed your friends?
killed them?
bled them like sheep .
if i wanted you dead , i'd kill you right now .
well , then who?
huh?
it's like jesse said .
the killings have started again .
someone's picking up where jethro left off .
you're talking about your granddaddy , boy .
billy bob says there's gonna be a good harvest .
he's talking about a harvest of blood , isn't he?
where is billy bob?
nobody's here , let's go .
oh , my god .
it's keith's .
it gets worse .
he's cut the phone line .
let's get out of here .
looks like billy bob's been busy .
dude !
dude , give it up .
somebody cut the wires .
there's a phone at the next farm .
it's about a 20 minute walk on the road but if we cut through the field , it's a lot quicker .
after you .
oh , my god .
oh , my god .
jeremiah .
what the hell is that?
run !
get back to the barn .
run !
fuck you !
no !
sh ... sh ...
hey .
hey !
hey , stop !
stop your fucking van !
stop !
stop !
you're one of those musicians !
i need to get to the sheriff .
i've got your injector pump .
i need to get to the sheriff , please !
is that your girlfriend?
candy , come on !
get in !
