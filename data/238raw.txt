ground forces have occupied several buildings along marehan road ... ... but they're all spread out .
eversmann's chalk four has set up a perimeter around wolcott's crash site .
ditomasso is in the adjacent structure .
captain steele and about 40 men , rangers , are here , a couple blocks away .
they're banged up pretty bad .
he set up a casualty collection point , i don't think they'll be able to move .
sergeant sanderson and a small delta team ... ... are moving from steele's position to the crash site as we speak .
draw off fire !
when this asshole stops to reload , cover me !
go !
sir .

loading !
keep going !
i'm jammed !
i got it !

rpg !
you all right?

yeah .
i can hear bells ringing .
come on !
come on !

a crowd is advancing six , seven blocks from the crash .
shughart and gordon again requestpermission ... ... to secure until convoy arrives .
over .
general , crowds are in the hundreds now .
from where they are , they can see things clearer than any of us .
they know what they're asking .
let me talk to them .
this is garrison .
i want to make sure thatyou understand whatyou're asking , so say it outloud .
we're asking to go in and set up a perimeter until ground support arrives .
you realize that i cannot tell you when that might be , it could take a while .
roger that .
you still want to go in there?
yes , sir .
colonel harrell?
yes , general?
it's your call .
roger that .

surveillance says to take hawlwadig , then go straight .
mcknight , we need you to turn around and head back to hawlwadig .
you're shitting me !
we just came through there !
there must be a better route !
that's the info i'm getting from joc , you need to turn around and head back .

son of a bitch .
romeo 64 , we're back where we started .
i'm low on ammo , i got many wounded including me ... ... vehicles that are barely running .
okay , danny , i need a no b . s . assessment here .
can you get to the crash site?
colonel , i can't see shit .
negative .
with the amount of wounded we have , we'd do more harm than good .
we need to come back to base , rearm and regroup and then we can go back out .
roger .
c 2 , bring them back .
get them out of there .
roger .
return to base .
we're going home !
let's go .
left .
roger that .
understand .
convoy returning to base .
what's up?
they're sending them back .
the convoy's headed back to base camp .
oh , now that makes sense , don't it?
we need to exfil the wounded now and get out of here before it's too late !
if colonel mcknight went back to base , then he had a good reason .
it changes nothing .
all right , listen up .
we're going to hold the perimeter and we're going to hold the strongpoint .
conserve your ammo .
only shoot at what you can hit .
the convoy is going to come .
we're going to get home .
loading !

i need you to focus .

juliet 64 , come in .

lieutenant colonel cribbs for you , sir .
cribbs?
they're still debating the route .
how long?
at least a couple of hours .
we haven't got that long , joe .
pakistani general says , since we didn't deign to inform him of the raid ... ... it'll take some time to mobilize the 10th mountain and 100 vehicles .
i understand , but it is my duty to remind him ... ... that my men are surrounded by thousands of armed somali militia .
it's imperative that we move them out of the hostile area and into the safe zone .
i need his help now .
yes , sir .
durant .
michael durant .
yes .
you are the ranger who kills my people?
i'm not a ranger .
i'm a pilot .
that's right .
none of you americans smoke anymore .
you all live long , dull , uninteresting lives .
what do you want with me?
you have taken hostages .
we have you .
my government will never negotiate for me .
then perhaps you and i can negotiate , huh?
soldier to soldier .
i'm not in charge .
course not .
you have the power to kill , but not negotiate .
in somalia , killing is negotiation .
do you really think if you get general aidid ... ... we will simply put down our weapons ... ... and adopt american democracy?
that the killing will stop?
without victory , there can be no peace .
there will always be killing , you see?
this is how things are in our world .
mike durant , we won'tleave you behind .
mike durant , we won'tleave you behind .
you got to take over from me .
both hands .
it's the femoral artery , but i can't see it .
which means that it's retracted up into the pelvis .
i have to find it and clamp it .
it's the only way to stop the bleeding .
i got no more ivs .
so , i'm going to need you to assist .
okay?
yeah , yeah .
now listen , jamie .
i got to do something , it's going to hurt .
i got to cause you more pain , but i have to do it to help you .
all right , you understand?
morphine .
i can't .
it'll lower your heart rate too far .
i'm sorry .
twombly , why don't you take his hands?
hold the wound open , keep pressure on the top of the leg .
yurek , take the feet and a flashlight .
on my count .

roger , kilo 11 .

ground personnel will have to mark target positions with infrared strobes .
get little birds on strafing runs and keep them going all night long .
if we don't hold back this city ... ... we'll have a 100 caskets to fill by morning .
yes , sir .
colonel harrell , ground personnel at crash site one ... ... will have to mark the target with infrared strobes to prep for airstrike .
mcknight .
between the 10th mountain and u. n. , we got enough personnel , okay?
danny , you guys do not have to go back out again .
i can't die here , man .
you're not going to die , all right?
you're not going to die .
i'm sorry .
you don't have anything to be sorry for .
you saved twombly .
you did perfect .

you did what you were trained to do .
you should be proud of that .

doc .
doc .
it's okay .
what are you doing?
we need the ammo .
you did all you could here .
they should've sent a medivac .
right now we'd be out there defending another crashed chopper .
more men would get torn up .
maybe .
see , you're thinking .
don't .
because , sergeant , you can't control who gets hit or who doesn't .
who falls out of a chopper or why .
it ain't up to you .
it's just war .
yeah , well , smith's still dead .
this all happened because blackburn fell .
should have , could have , don't matter .
you'll get plenty of time to think about all that later .
believe me .
sergeant , you got your men this far .
you did it right today .
you need to start thinking about getting these men out of here .
well , shall we?
i need four guys in this corner now !

you bet your ass we will .
we got to regroup .

i can still do my job .
you get some rest now , okay?

there are still men out there .
goddamn .
hey , hoot , why do you do it , man?
why?
you some kind of war junkie?
i won't say a goddamn word .
why?
they won't understand .
they won't understand why we do it .
they won't understand it's about the men next to you .
and that's it .
that's all it is .
don't even think about it , all right?
i'm better on my own .
we started a whole new week .
it's monday .
i was talking to blackburn the other day ... ... and he asked me , " what changed?
why are we going home?
and i said , " nothing .
but that's not true , you know .
i think everything's changed .
i know i've changed .
a friend of mine asked me before i got here ....
it was when we were all shipping out .
why are you going to fight somebody else's war?
what , do y'all think you're heroes?
i didn't know what to say at the time ... ... but if he asked me again , i'd say no .
i'd say there's no way in hell .
nobody asks to be a hero .
it just sometimes turns out that way .
i'll talk to your ma and pa when i get home , okay?
my love , you are strong and you will do well in life .
i love you and my children deeply .
today and tomorrow , let each day grow and grow .
keep smiling and never give up , even when things get you down .
so , in closing , my love ... ... tonight , tuck my children in bed warmly .
tell them i love them .
then hug them for me ... ... and give them both a kiss good night for daddy
