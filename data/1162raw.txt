growing up in the streets ain't no joke .
there's crazy crime ... drugs ... and mad violence .
yeah , the streets is tough .
but there ain't no streets tougher than mine .
the streets of ...
malibu .
it's hardcore up in the'bu , y'all .
it's just part of the everyday struggle .
things go down here people should never see .
we got bag ladies ... big ballers ... everybody strapped with a 9 .
this is my ghetto .
the mall .
most of the time the police won't even come through .
we got all sorts of sets up in here .
we got the beach boys ... the a ccs : the abused children of celebrities ... and this is my crew .
that's my boy mocha .
that brother straight up crazy .
he did time in public school !
that there is hadji .
he's the beast from the middle east .
and that's monster .
she had a big chip on her shoulder ... till she ate it .
hey , that's me !
b rad g.
i run things around here .
now , sometimes bustas be disrespecting .
and you can't punk out , no matter what the devil may bring .
hey , yo , fool !
we about to have some hardcore drama go down right about now !
that's right !
this our mall .
always has been , always will be .
mr. amerislani .
our clerk accidentally gave you the wrong aromatherapy candles .
here you go !
you validate parking?
of course , sir .
that's what i'm talking about !
we get ours !
that's my crib .
it ain't much , but it's all i got .
if you elect me governor ...
that's my pops , bill gluckman .
he getting his campaign on .
i got mad love for the man , but he's old school .
he needs to bring his word to the street .
that's where i come in .
you see , friends ...
california is my family .
and speaking of family , i want to introduce my wife , bess .
and my daughter , little brenda .
where's your son brad?
yes , sir , where is he?
thank you for your questions .
unfortunately , we are out of time for today .
yo , what's up , y'all?
this is b rad g , kicking it from'bu .
represizzent !
hi , pops , it's me !
b rad !
hi , brad .
show's over !
that's it .
show's over !
see that?
i know how to get the party started !
and i know my pop was loving it .
it's a disaster !
the times and the chronicle will run it as a big joke .
thank god !
how did this happen?
i have no idea .
i didn't even know he was in town !
we can't keep tabs on this kid?
can anybody tell me where he is?
that was off the hinges !
i just got you another million votes right there !
what you doing here , son?
i knew i had to show up in order for you to blow up !
so i called up captain tony , he fired up the lear jizzy ... and boo yah !
i'm in the hizzy .
i'll be on the campaign trizzy too .
24/ 7 .
you know , kissing babies and whatnot .
pound it .
yeah , all good .
tom , you down , you gots ...
okay , dude .
i'll let you all do your campaign thing .
oh , bill ...
you need to shut this down .
tell your son that he cannot be in your campaign , period .
wait a minute .
i love his enthusiasm .
it's a little misguided , but ...
isn't there something he can do for the campaign where he can't hurt us?
no .
phones?
no .
stuffing envelopes?
making signs?
signs .
in bill gluckman's administration ... women are going to have better health care .
women are going to have better daycare !
and women will have better jobs !
bill gluckman is down with the bitches and the ho's "?
it was supposed to have read " women are first with gluckman .
no , no .
that's old school , pops .
you need to keep your pimp hand strong .
so , bradley ...
yo , why you keep calling me that?
well , that's your name , isn't it?
it's my slave name , all right?
i told you like 50 times !
okay .
b rad .
what's up?
what are your goals , b rad?
what do you want out of life?
to be the biggest rapper there ever was .
you see , doc , i got something to say ... and i need the world to hear it .
i'm a " lyrisologist .
i can rap about anything .
see?
i'm the shiznit !
i'll buy y'all cars .
i see .
when did you first start feeling like you were this ... shiznit?
dang , way back in the day .
i had these beats in my head since i was a little shorty .
from then on in , it was hip hop 24/ 7 .
as i was growing up , my parents and me couldn't communicate .
they were always on different channels .
finish those vegetables , bradley .
they smell good .
you won't be excused until you do .
forget y'all !
that's it , mister
what i'm sensing , brad ... is that ... your parents weren 't always there for you .
no .
that's ridiculous .
what about your bar mitzvah?
what's the theme of your bar mitzvah?
star wars?
baseball?
superheroes?
it's o. p. p. , bitch !
what?
bess .
i think you want to share .
b rad , you're a wonderful son .
it's just that ...
well ...
bess , let's not beat around the bush .
brad ... your behavior has become an embarrassment to the family .
don't be hating .
and i can't have you on the campaign anymore .
what?
that's how it is?
you done it now !
y'all opened up big a can of tough love !
what can we do , doctor?
i don't know .
this is the most advanced case of " gangsta phrenia " i've ever seen .
three colors for our country .
where's the red?
bill !
hey , bill .
how'd it go with dr. feldman?
great .
if he sees brad five times a week for the next three or four years ... we should see some real improvement .
but , sir , the election is eight weeks away .
right , good point .
it's okay .
we've been brainstorming some different approaches ...
... and we might have something solid .
well , i'm all ears .
go !
okay , sir .
brad acts ghetto , right?
but he's never been east of beverly hills .
but what if we give him a little dose of reality?
let him get a firsthand look at the ghetto .
you mean have brad actually go there?
exactly .
well , now , that sounds dangerous .
no !
perfectly safe .
how's it work?
we hire actors to play gangstas .
right .
they will carjack brad and take him on a tour around the'hood .
give him a taste of what the thug life is really like .
it might just scare the black out of him .
excuse me?
hey , don't you have something to do?
enough of the p. c.
fact is , unless we do something now , brad is going to cost us this election .
who would play the gangsters?
remember the anti crime spot we shot a month ago?
we've got that queued up .
yes , we do .
over here , please .
for too long , street violence has torn californians apart .
bill gluckman wants to put our divisions behind us .
hey , instead of thinking about what set you're from ... or what crew you're rolling with ... why don't you both be brothers?
what do you say?
your hair looks great .
i ain't never thought of it like that .
shake hands .
you see?
california is my family .
if we all work together as a family , there's no telling how high we can go .
see , that's beautiful .
these are the guys we're talking about .
all right , let me get this straight .
you want us to scare this kid into acting like a little white boy again?
if you don't think you can handle it
of course we can handle it .
i'm from juilliard , for chrissake .
i'm from the pasadena playhouse .
good .
i have some background information on our dear boy brad .
materials .
mali bootay?
yes , he considers himself a rapper of sorts .
frigging a.
the story is your basic kidnapping .
by kidnapping , you mean we hold him for ransom?
good question .
right .
now , when you see him start to get ghetto and do his whole black thing
yes , that .
i want it to piss you off .
tour him around the'hood , around the ghetto , if you will ...
... and show him what it's really like .
in the ghetto?
pays 15 grand apiece , son .
we're in .
good .
now , on the flip side ...
flip it .
if you two screw up and a single hair is touched on brad's overprivileged head ...
i will see to it personally that you two do some serious time .
are we clear?
oh , we are cristal .
i like that .
mr. gibbons .
what about the money?
we have 5 up front ... and 25 when you return him to us ... white .
as the driven snow .
pleasure doing business , gentlemen .
let me get that for you , sir .
i'll call you .
or better yet , i'll holler .
we'll holler back !
holler back , player .
thank you .
all right .
congratulations , buddy !
we just booked another gig !
not so fast , this is dangerous stuff .
this is the ghetto .
we could get shot !
come on , man .
we can handle ourselves .
right?
this will be the ultimate acting challenge .
you know what really chaps my ass?
what?
after all of our years of training and studying ... they continue to give us parts that are gangbangers .
just once i'd like to play someone who speaks with proper grammar ... and doesn't wear those timberlands with the laces undone , it's so sloppy .
it beats getting dunked on by bill gluckman !
do we even know anybody that lives in the ghetto?
my cousin .
shondra .
that's the stupidest thing i ever heard .
i got better things to do with my time .
like what?
work at wiener on a bun?
come on !
really , you're always talking about improving yourself .
here's your chance !
i am improving myself , fool !
i broke up with no good , gangbanging tec , i'm going to beauty school ... and then i'm gonna hook up my own salon .
how about hooking a brother up with a pepsi and fries?

nothing to do but keep it real and be proud of who you are .
