don't worry .
we have the situation under control .
oh , boy .
i know , sir .
oh , boy .

townsville will not stand for this .
mayor?
hello?
city being destroyed?
where are you going?
oh , boy .
mayor , where are you going?
we're in a serious pickle .
exactly .
girls , no !
hello .
hello .
the usual , cucor .
i have a fine vintage for you here .
picked fresh today .
oh , boy !
girls , girls , are you okay?
tag !
you're it , professor !
okay , girls .
girls , it's almost bedtime , okay?
girls?
come on , professor , you're it .
you gotta catch us .
yes , i suppose i do , don't i?
got you , you little bunny .
help !
i got caughted !
blossom , watch out !
you're the sole survivor !
no way , professor !
you can't catch me .
yes , i can because the game's over , and it's your bedtime .
now come up here so we can catch you .
well now , three little girls had a very busy day today , didn't they?
yeah , it was fun .
we met lots of kids .
and we learned things .
and we played tag !
i'm glad you had so much fun because tomorrow will be busy too .
put your nighties on and get in bed .
we need to talk about something .
okay , everybody in?
yep , what's up , daddy o?
well , it's your super powers .
i'm not sure how to say this ... ... but i don't think you should use them in public anymore .
why?
well , your powers are very special and unique ... ... and although we have a lot of fun doing things in the house ... ... out in townsville , people don't understand how special you girls are .
and unfortunately , people often get scared or angry ... ... when they don't understand something special or unique .
that's silly .
i think so too , but nonetheless , take it easy with the powers tomorrow .
just give townsville a little time to understand your specialness , okay?
okay .
okay .
yeah .
people are nice .
things will be fine .
so i'll be waiting here to pick you up when school gets out , okay?
okay , but don't worry , professor .
things are gonna be fine .
girls , we didn't know if you'd be joining us today .
take your seats .
i'm sorry to say there won't be any recess for a while ... ... due to all the reconstruction .
secondly , i'm afraid we won't have any lights or water for a while .
and a broken refrigerator means snack time is out ... ... so let's try to ignore all the workmen and noise and such ... ... and get right to work , shall we?
girls , can you recite the alphabet for us?
girls?
abcs?
a , b , c , d ....
e !
hey , galldang it !
you done darn broke my board .
flamdanggling consarglers .
f ....
almost time to pick up the girls .
better motor .
that's him , boys !
he's in cahoots with the evil pickle cart killers ... ... cucumber crushers , vinegar varlets , dill stroyers !
why , it's not kosher !
it's
let it go , mayor .
let it go .
are these your babies?
yes , but they were just playing .
they're really very good little girls .
and i need to pick them up from school .
i understand , sir ... ... but we want you to come downtown with us to ask you a few questions .
you guys , my kids .
i really ought to pick them up .
i can't just leave them there ... ... alone .
he's not coming .
he hates us .
he totally hates us .
no , he probably just got held up , or maybe the car broke ... ... or maybe he forgot ... ... or maybe he hates us .
come on , let's try and find our way home .
we're not supposed to use our powers .
come on , girls .
the cause?
three super powered little girls .
should manufacturing super powered children be illegal?
a great travesty has befallen our beloved city .
i was easing the seat back when this atomic punk flies in with no warning .
the devastation?
devastating .
it should be illegal .
used to be a time when you could buy an honest pickle .
they were lighting up the sky .
estimated dollars in damages?
a whopping 25 million .
i'm offended just looking at them .
the kind that you can only find at a pickle cart .
now jamie's crying .
well , it seems that  hatred is running rampant for
those mutant , bug eyed  pickle cart killing
freaks .
back to you , linda .
they are little freaks , aren't they?
with more on this subject is
get them out .
we don't need them .
we don't need them .
we interrupt this program for a news flash .
arrested in connection with the tag incident ... ... was the scientist responsible for creating the girls , professor utonium .
please , just let me go .
my girls , they need me .
they don't know i'm in jail .
what if they try to go home themselves?
they can't find their way if they don't fly .
please , they're only little girls who are probably cold , scared ... ... and maybe even lost .
well , it's official .
i have no idea where we are .
well , i can't say it's been the best day .
but it probably couldn't get much worse .
hey , it's okay .
maybe there's a box we can get in around back .
come on .
see , there's a whole bunch of boxes .
what's the matter?
did somebody get lost?
wow , thanks !
hey , wait !
come back .
hey , guys , over here .
hi .
what's your name?
i'm blossom .
buttercup .
and i'm bubbles .
go away , please .
do not look at me .
we just wanted to thank you for saving us from those gangsters .
that was amazing with the trashcan lid .
it was all : swoosh , bang , splash , bam , boom .
yeah , you rock .
no , please .
i dare not listen ... ... for i have been lashed by harsh tongues for too long .
alas , my little ones , i do not rock .
for i , jojo , am a monster .
you're not a monster .
monsters are evil .
anybody who would save us like you did is so not evil .
you're no monster , mister .
you're just really dirty .
please .
you're just trying to make me feel better .
but my pain is not for you to understand .
besides , how could you?
for you are pure and innocent and , most certainly , loved .
how could you know what it is to be cast out ... ... into a world that only offers misery?
how could you know what it's like for people to fear and despise you ... ... for the very things that make you special ... ... because you don't fit in , because you are ... ... a freak? !
because ... ... we're freaks too .
what amazing powers !
no , they're terrible .
i bet everyone hates them .
yeah .
and they hate you too .
yes .
i am in the same boat .
this brain is full of brilliant ideas .
but will anyone listen?
no .
nothing in this gray matters .
so , what's the point?
jojo , don't be sad .
our dad says people get angry when they don't understand ... ... something special or unique .
if you just give people time , they'll start to understand your specialness .
yeah .
you just gotta believe in yourself .
if i construct my help the town and make it a better place machine ... ... people will come to understand my specialness?
i'll do it , but i'll need your help .
jump in , take this device into the volcano .
we need to harness the energy of the earth's core for power .
what are you talking about?
the plan .
what plan?
our plan .
to do what?
to make the town better .
what?
you know .
we will build the help the town and make it a better place machine .
everyone will see our special abilities are good .
they will love us .
remember?
it was your idea .
oh , yeah .
but use our powers?
yes .
no way .
come on .
no .
we're never using our powers again .
girls , don't be sad .
your powers are great .
you just gotta believe in yourself .
yes !
yes !
yes !
we did good?
you did very good .
very good indeed .
now what do we do?
we construct the superstructure .
look .
can't you see our plan is working?
our work is proceeding as planned .
at last , our lives will be better .
at last , we will be accepted .
at last , our greatest work is comple
oops .
what's wrong?
well ... ... there is one last teeny tiny , itsy bitsy thing we still need .
yes !
yes !
yes !
we did good?
you did very good .
very good indeed .
now what do we do?
well , because you've done so good ... ... i've got a special surprise .
worthless .
lame .
stupid .
okay .
better .
almost .
awesome !
come , girls , our work is fin
i mean , time to go .
but , jojo ....
we haven't seen the gazelles .
or the crocodiles .
or the unicorns .
just one unic
excuse me , ma'am .
i think you dropped this .
i thought the zoo kept all the animals in cages .
yeah , well , you're welcome , lady .
don't listen , bubbles .
that's right , bubbles , do not listen .
all of you , deafen yourselves to their heartless words .
they do not know it is their saviors they are speaking to .
they are unaware your actions will have helped change their world forever .
because we have helped the town and made it a better place .
you think they'll be surprised?
oh , yeah .
will they still be mad at us for playing tag?
no , they'll have forgotten all about that .
will they love us?
yes .
really?
would i lie to you?
i'm so excited !
we'll show them !
hey , where's?
professor !
girls , thank goodness you're okay .
i'm so sorry .
i'm a terrible , terrible parent .
you must hate me for not picking you up from school , but it's not my fault .
it's this town .
they've gone crazy .
it's like they've never seen kids playing before .
i knew your powers would take some getting used to .
but jail?
lawsuits?
angry mobs?
what's next?
don't worry , professor .
things are gonna get better .
we promise .
today's the day .
today's the day !
today's the day !
today's  the day .
what to wear?
what to wear?
that's nice .
professor , wake up !
wake up .
wake  up .
wake up , my brothers .
wake up and seize the  day !
the day?
yeah , the day when we
show townsville just what our powers can really do .
what?
we're gonna show townsville just what our powers can really do .
we did something really good .
that's gonna really
help !
well , we met this guy .
with powers like us .
who was also hated by everybody .
but he had this great idea .
to help the town .
and make it a better place .
that way the town would accept us .
we did something to help .
so we used all our powers .
and abilities .
and his ideas .
to help everybody .
city of townsville ...
it's gonna be so cool . ... i'd like to take this moment ...
you're gonna be so proud . ... to thank the little people ...
everyone's gonna love us . ... who helped to make this day a smashing success .
we did really goo
blossom , bubbles and buttercup , i couldn't have done it without you .
it's their fault !
i knew they were no good !
what happened?
this isn't making the town a better place .
yes , it is , for me .
the hobo formerly known as " jojo " is no more .
mojo jojo !
for too long , apes and monkeys have been under the thumb of man .
the world !
professor , we didn't want this .
liars .
fibbers .
you've doomed us all .
please , professor .
please believe us .
i don't know who to believe .
i thought you were good .
no !
yeah !
all right !
i rock !
i rock so hard .
for i , mojo jojo , have succeeded ... ... in my first , greatest and most brilliant plan ever .
and i , mojo jojo , shall be ... ... king of the planet of the apes !
you shall be king?
preposterous .
what?
how dare you .
for it is i who is the one most suited to be ruler .
those are my clothes .
i , ojo tango , shall be simian supreme .
no ojo .
mojo .
as i unleash the offensive omnipotence of the oppressive orango tank .
hold on .
oh , no !
i shall get a grip on the situation .
you better not .
as i , rocko socko , seize control and rule .
wait !
i , baboon kaboom ... ... with my baboom bot , will be the bomb .
and if you don't like it ... ... you can sniff my baboom bot bombs .
that's classy .
gangway !
for we , the gogo po trol ... ... form a chain of command that will take hold of your world .
i , hota wata , am boiling mad , for you are all wet behind the ears .
so i shall unleash a scalding torrent to drown you out , for i don't give a
watch your mouth .
i , cha ching cha ching , symbolize chaotic calamity .
we , the doot da doot da doo doos , shall rain on your parade because ... ... we're the spit .
my name is hacha chacha and here is my schpiel
a diabolical plan with lots of appeal
spreading out bananas far and wide
and fixing up the folks for a slippery slide
pretty catchy .
i , blah blah blah blah , shall create a sauce of chaos and stir up trouble ... ... with a destructive force known as the tormato .
tormato?
tormato .
i , killa drilla .
i , bonzo bango .
i , rolo ovo .
i , cruncha muncha .
i , wacko smacko .
i , pappy whappy .

do not continue with your ramblings .
mine are the ramblings to be obeyed .
i am the king , supreme leader and dictator .
your plans are my plans because you made plans and my plan was to make you .
i plan to rule the planet , not to have my plans plan to stop me .
i am your creator , i am your king .
i am mojo jojo .
obey me !
that jerk , that big , fat , dumb jerk .
he duped us .
he planned it all along , and we fell for it .
and now , everybody hates us even more .
what are you doing?
what does it look like i'm doing?
i'm building a house because now we have to live here .
live here?
yeah , don't you see?
this can be the bedroom , and this is my bed .
that can be your bed over there .
i don't wanna sleep on a rock !
maybe if someone hadn't pushed bubbles into the school ....
look , she speaks .
maybe if somebody hadn't insisted on walking home ... ... so we could run into the biggest liar in the universe !
we weren't allowed to use our powers , and you know it !
look , it's miss goody goody .
we weren't gonna get people to stop hating us by breaking rules .
yeah .
and using our super powers ... ... to make a help the town and make it a better place machine ... ... was following rules? !
i didn't see you putting up a fight .
well , you're gonna now .
if it weren't for you , we wouldn't be in this stupid mess .
you stupid !
i'm not fighting with you , buttercup .
because you know i'll kick your butt .
no , because i know never mind .
i'm not fighting with you , and i'm not talking to you ever !
well , prepare yourself for a long silence , girl ... ... because we're gonna spend the rest of our lives here , thanks to you .
at least i got me a bed .
blossom?
buttercup?
do you hear that?
no !
blossom , what should we do?
miss goody goody'll say we should take responsibility for our mistakes ...
... and go help everybody .
it sounds like they're hurting .
who cares?
what do we do?
nothing .
girls !
professor !
professor !
professor !
professor !

bubbles , wait !
good job , but we've gotta save  the baby !
holy ....
hey , what about?
the dog !
you'll be safe now .
here you go , miss .
thank you .
come on , bubbles , let's
save those people .
wait !
this isn't my baby .
good dog .
can we find the professor now , please?
oh , man !
now stay !
doggone it !
okay .
you should be safe here .
this is hopeless !
i know .
there's too many monkeys .
what can we do?
get your hands off him , you darn dirty ape !
i didn't mean it !
it was an accident !
he wouldn't let go !
and the dog .
that stupid dog , and then the monkeys , and he
i couldn't he couldn't oh , man !
buttercup !
you're a genius !
i am?
she is?
yeah .
the one way to stop the monkeys , save the town and find the professor ... ... is to use our powers to
better yet , watch !
wow !
that was amaz hey !
gross !
cut it out .
come on , girls .
let's put an end to this gorilla warfare .
good one , bubbles .
girls  shut up !
i was afraid of this .
they've returned and found out what their powers can really do .
come .
you will make a good " power proof " vest .
none of those monkeys had professor !
where could he be?
take a good guess !
come on , girls !
we've got one last monkey to get off our backs !
not so fast ... ... mojo jojo !
look at the little heroes here to save their daddy !
no , girls !
save yourselves !
sorry , professor !
we can take this chump chimp down !
nothing he can do can stop us !
that's better .
it's good you little freaks know when you're beaten .
now if you'll excuse me , i , mojo jojo , have a town to take over !
i have a world to rule !
i have to seize control of an area ... ... and force its inhabitants to follow my way of thinking !
even if it means ... ... taking extreme measures !
you wouldn't !
i would !
professor !
now i am more mojo than before !
now , as i was saying before i was so rudely interrupted ... ... i , mojo jojo , have succeeded ... ... in my first , greatest and most brilliant plan ever !
and i , mojo jojo ... ... shall be king !
girls , thank goodness you're okay .
now let's get out of this town !
it's no use .
we already tried running away .
we have to fix the problem we helped start .
you said to give everyone time to understand our specialness .
well , now it's time for everyone to understand .
especially mojo !
surrender now , and we'll go easy on you !
down here !
oh , my !
you're actually trying to stop me?
that's so cute !
try , nothing !
we will stop you !
who are you calling " cute "?
okay , let's play !
buttercup !
good job , girls !
that more mojo is no more !
girls !
somebody's mad .
look out !
oh , no , look !
mojo's got blossom pinned down !
i have an idea .
come on !
do you think he's finished?
no , but you are !
fools !
you dare to challenge me?
attempt to defeat me?
try to destroy me? !
i , who saved you from certain death?
after all i've done for you , you betray me?
and why?
for them?
the ones who hated you ....
have forsaken you?
can't you see?
none of them will ever understand you as i can .
for we are kindred spirits , whose powers spring from the same source .
so , girls , do not make me destroy you .
for we are smarter , we are stronger !
we are invincible !
we have the power !
we are superior to them !
and we shall rule !
all we have to do is work together .
girls , join me .
no !
we'd never join you , and it's because we are stronger .
because we are invincible .
because we have the power !
we have to protect them from you !
it's you who has to be feared .
because you are a monster !
you are evil !
and you are ... ... it !
curses !
girls , you were right !
we should stop mojo , and i know how !
i whipped up an antidote to chemical x !
it'll do away with his powers !
i'm so sorry for doubting you .
you are good little girls , and i love you !
we love you too !
and we're really sorry .
we messed up really bad .
but we're ready , professor .
ready?
to take the antidote x to get rid of our powers .
if it wasn't for them , none of this would have happened .
and maybe everyone would like us more if we were just normal little girls .
no !
don't do that ... ... because that was pretty cool , with the ....
girls , i think what the mayor is trying to say is ... ... we're sorry , and thank you .
yes , that was super , just super !
amazing !
fantastic !
wonderful !
stupendous !
you rock !
thank you .
that was awesome !
you were all flying and running !
and then , laser eyes !
then , bam !
and then and then , bam , you punched that guy !
remember?
yeah , that was great .
you know , this town stinks .
and i was wondering if , maybe sometime ... ... we could , like , call you to save the day or whatever .
can we , professor?
well , i don't know ....
okay , but only if it's before your bedtime .
help !
sugar , spice and everything nice .
these were the ingredients chosen to create the perfect little girl .
chemical x.
thus blossom , bubbles and buttercup were born !
using their ultra super powers , they've dedicated their lives ... ... to fighting crime and the forces of evil .
the powerpuff girls !
hey , that's a good name for them .
powerpuff girls , yeah !
i like that .
wonder if they will .
i'll run it by them .
powerpuff girls !
