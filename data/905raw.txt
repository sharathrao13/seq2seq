yeah , some rags and a radio .
hey , we don't need a moving wan .
ah , let's go .
but i wanna make myself look good .
hey jim , can you hold this stuff for me for a while?
yeah , sure .
last time i saw you , you've got nothing neither a woman nor a radio .
hey , jim .
i'm used to radios .
wanda , this is jim .
jim , this is wanda .
hi .
hi .
me beer .
yeah , likewise .
hey jim , can you cash this check for me?
i signed him .
hey , what's this?
you're not gonna believe this , but that's an income tax refund .
i found it in the mailbox of the old place .
you mean , you worked last year?
six month in a toy factory .
you don't know how men suffer for children .
hey , henry .
you're gonna buy one or be one .
hey , i'm gonna be one .
give her a beer .

shot of bark whiskey , please .
hey , old timer .
this one's on the house .
i thank you .
thanx , jim .

it's easier that way .
oh , look at this .
<?
schifern? > incorporated labourer , no experience .
oh , look at this .
shifrin incorporated labourer , no experience .
hey , that's me .
i'm gonna run down there , i'm gonna hop on the pass .
henry , are you losing what's left of your goddamned mind?
you mean , you gonna leave me here all alone?
all alone?
hey baby , there's jim , there is lilly .
come on .
what are you doing with a woman , henry?
lilly , sometimes i think you could use one too .
four whiskeys .
look hank , why don't you go tomorrow .
we just met .
when you ran off like this , i feel you're trying to get away from me .
hey , baby .
i'm doing this for us .
we're be able to drink with class .
we don't have to be barflies , returned from the grave .
thank you , bartender .
ok , oldtimer .
hey , he didn't pay .
he already paid .
oh , god , i will get a job .
yeah , hey .
to the working class .
right .
to us .
to us .
with gods help .
no chance .
even the devil wouldn't have you .
hey , what's your problem?
hey , you got any of those little mints for breath?
oh yeah .
baby .
excuse me , who are you?
hmm , the eternal question .
i don't know .
how do you explain this recent unemployment record?
hey , anybody didn't get a job .
takes some man to make you a hard worker .
excuse me?
hey , i was just joking .
everything here seems to read 'none '.
hobbies none , religion none , education none .
even where they'd ask you sex you put none .
hardly none .
yeah , you can put down now .
so , how did the job go?
oh , they gave me a hard on .
they couldn't use a hard on .
this is a world where everybody's gotta do something .
you know somebody laid down this rule , that everybody's gotta do something .
they've gotta be something
you know , a dentist , a <? glider? > pilot , an arc , a janitor , a preacher , all that .
sometimes , i just get tired of thinking of all the things that i don't wanna do .
all things that i don't wanna be .
all places that i don't wanna go , like india , like get my teeth cleaned .
save the whale , all that .
i don't understand that .
you're not supposed to think about it .
i think the whole trick is not to think about it .
oh , i guess wanda went home , huh?
henry .
yeah?
eddie came in with a fifth of burbon .
tonight's his night of , ben's working his shift .
i won't miss eddie tonight .
henry , wanda left with eddie .
huh?
what?
jim?
yeah?
scotch and water .
humanity , you never had it from the beginning .
hello .
i paid the rent .
did you get the job?
yeah , i start tomorrow . <?
matred d musso at frank's .? >
listen , i told you not to leave me alone .
don't hit me !
hit you?
i'm not your goddamned pimp .
stop acting like one .
why it had to be eddie? !? !
he symbolizes everything that disgusts me !
what?
obviousness , unoriginal macho energy .
ladies man .
you're right .
he's not much .
i made an error , an unhappy error , but i'll drink .
when i drink , i'm moving in a wrong direction .
you know , every time i get with a woman , something happens .
sometimes it happens sooner , sometimes it happens later .
this time it happened pretty fast . <?? > you don't own me .
hey , that's right .
nobody owns anybody .
i just thought , that we are something special .
because we're just green corn .
hey , what are we?
just people that pass in hallways?
i guess i expect too much .
hey , i can't handle this scene , you know .
i ought to be a fucking monk .
yeah .
hello?
natali sorensen .
i know this sound like i'm a lunetic or something , but i have this reason why i wish to talk to you .

we've got a call , that somebody was dying .
hey , everything is fine .
you know , how each of these calls cost the tax payer?
jesus , why don't you turn your radio down?
i can't find anybody .

i guess it's not fair on willbur , but he's got nothing but money .
ooh , poor willbur .
what did you do when i was gone?
where the hell are my panties?
where the hell is anything?

oh , well , i was looking for a lottery ticket .
you don't play the lottery .
oh , well , i. hahaha
is your head really allright?
it's just fine .
what did you say?
oh , it's hatred .
it's the only thing that lasts .
that guy beats his old lady and i hear he killed two guys .
oh , shit .
what the fuck's he doing out?
i don't know .
he killed one man , they put him in , and he got out , killed that oher guy and now he's out again .
he killed one man , they put him in , and he got out , killed that other guy and now he's out again .
maybe it was selfdefence or maybe it's our penal system .
anyhow , he's out on parole .
he must jack off his parole officer , when he comes around .
i'm getting out .
oh , i'm sorry . = get up you whore !
maybe this guy had a reason for killing .
hey , most people think they do .
<?

this thing upon me , like a flower and a feast .
this thing upon me , crawling like a snake .
it's not death , but dying will solve it's power .
and as my hands drop the last desperate pen . it's an cheap room .
they will find me there .
i never know my name , my meaning .
i know the treasure of my escape .
