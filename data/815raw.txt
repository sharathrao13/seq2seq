25 . 000
it is my sad duty to inform you that eva pern , spiritual leader of the nation , entered immortality at 8 : 25 this evening .
you are not welcome here .
he was the father of my children too .
they have a right to see him , to pay their last respects .
you are not his wife .
your children are bastards .
no , no !
he's my papa !
oh what a circus
oh what a show
argentina has gone to town
over the death of an actress
called eva pern
we've all gone crazy
mourning all day and mourning all night
falling over ourselves to get all
of the misery right
oh what an exit
that's how to go
when they're ringing your curtain down
demand to be buried
like eva pern
it's quite a sunset
and good for the country ln a roundabout way
we've made the front page of all
the world's papers today
but who is this santa evita?
why all this howling , hysterical sorrow?
what kind of goddess has lived among us?
how will we ever get by without her?
she had her moments she had some style
the best show in town was the crowd
outside the casa rosada
crying , " eva pern
but that's all gone now
as soon as the smoke from the funeral clears
we're all gonna see , and how
she did nothing for years
you let down your people , evita
you were supposed to have been immortal
that's all they wanted
not much to ask for
but in the end you
could not deliver
sing , you fools , but you got it wrong
enjoy your prayers because you haven't got long
your queen is dead your king is through
she's not coming back to you
show business kept us all alive
since 1 7 october 1 945
but the star has gone the glamour's worn thin
that's a pretty bad state for a state to be in
instead of government , we had a stage
instead of ideas , a prima donna's rage
instead of help , we were given a crowd
she didn't say much , but she said it loud
don't cry for me , argentina
for i am ordinary
unimportant
and undeserving
of such attention
unless we all are
i think we all are
so share my glory
so share my coffin
it's our funeral too
senor magaldi?
it's seven o 'clock .
you'll be late .
now , eva pern
had every disadvantage
you need if you're going to succeed
no money , no cash
no father , no bright lights
there was nowhere she'd been
at the age of 1 5
as this tango singer found out
agustin magaldi
who has the distinction of being the first
man to be of use
to eva duarte
on this night of 1 000 stars
let me take you to heaven's door
where the music of love's guitars
plays forever more
in the glow of those twinkling lights
we shall love through eternity
on this night in a million nights
fly away with me
i never dreamed that a kiss could be as sweet as this
now i know that it can
i used to wander alone without a love of my own
i was a desperate man
but all my grief disappeared
and all the sorrow i'd feared wasn't there any more
on that magical day when you first came my way , miamor
to think that a man as famous as you are
could love a poor little nothing like me
i want to be a part of b. a. buenos aires , big apple
just listen to that
they're onto you , magaldi
i'd get out while you can
it's happened at last
i'm starting to get started
i'm moving out with my man
now , eva , don't get carried away
monotony passed , suburbia departed
who could ever be fond of the back of beyond
don't hear words that i didn't say
what's that?
you desert the girl you love?
the girl i love?
what are you talking about?
she really brightened up your out of town engagement
she gave you all she had she wasn't in your contract
you must be quite relieved
that no one's told the papers
so far
i want to be a part of b. a. buenos aires , big apple
would i have done
what i did
if i hadn't thought
if i hadn't known
we would stay together?
seems to me there's no point in resisting
she's made up her mind , you've no choice
why don't you be the man who discovered her?
you'll never be remembered for your voice
the city can be paradise
for those who have the cash
the class and the connections
what you need to make a splash
the likes of you get swept up
in the morning with the trash
if you were rich or middle class ...
screw the middle classes
i will never accept them
my father's other family were middle class
and we were kept out of sight
hidden from view at his funeral
do all your one night stands
give you this trouble?
eva , beware of the city
it's hungry and cold
can't be controlled
it is mad
those who are fools are swallowed up whole
and those who are not become
what they should not become
changed , in short they go bad
bad is good for me
i'm bored , so clean and so ignored
i've only been predictable , respectable
birds fly out of here so why , oh why , oh why the hell can't l?
i only want variety of society
i want to be a part of b. a. buenos aires , big apple
five years from now i shall come back
and finally say you have your way
come to town
but you'll look at me with a foreigner's eyes
the magical city
a younger girl's city
a fantasy long since put down
all you've done to me was that a young girl's fantasy?
i played your city games all right , didn't l?
i already know what cooks
how the dirty city feels and looks
i tasted it last night , didn't l?
eva , beware your ambition
it's hungry and cold
can't be controlled , will run wild
this in a man is danger enough
but you are a woman
not even a woman
not very much more than a child
and whatever you say i'll not steal you away
what's new , buenos aires?
i'm new i want to say i'm just a little stuck on you
you'll be on me too
i get out here , buenos aires
stand back
you oughta know what you're gonna get in me
just a little touch of star quality
fill me up with your heat with your noise , with your dirt , overdo me
let me dance to your beat make it loud , let it hurt , run it through me
don't hold back you are certain to impress
tell the driver this is where i'm staying
get this !
just look at me dressed up somewhere to go
we'll put on a show
take me in at your flood , give me speed give me lights , set me humming
shoot me up with your blood wine me up with your nights
watch me coming
all i want is a whole lot of excess
tell the singer this is where i'm playing
stand back , buenos aires
because you oughta know what you're gonna get in me
just a little touch of star quality
and
if ever i go to far
it's because of the things you are
beautiful town
i love you
and
if i need a moment's rest
give your lover the very best
real eiderdown
and silence
you're a tramp , you're a treat you will shine to the death
you are shoddy
but you're flesh , you are meat you shall have every breath in my body
put me down for a lifetime of success
give me credit , i'll find ways of paying
rio de la plata
florida , corrientes , nueve de julio
all i want to know
i don't expect my love affairs
to last for long
never fool myself
that my dreams will come true
being used to trouble
i anticipate it
but all the same i hate it
wouldn't you?
so what happens now?
another suitcase in another hall
take your picture off another wall
where am i going to?
you'll get by , you always have before
time and time again
i've said that
i don't care
that i'm immune to gloom
that i'm hard through and through
but every time it matters
all my words desert me
so anyone can hurt me
and they do
so what happens now?
another suitcase in another hall
take your picture off another wall
you'll get by you always have before
where am i going to?
call in three months time
and i'll be fine
i know
well , maybe not that fine
but i'll survive anyhow
i won't recall the names and places
of each sad occasion
but that's no consolation
here and now
where am i going to?
don't ask any more
good night and thank you , whoever
she's in every magazine been photographed , seen
she is known
we don't like to rush but your case has been packed
if she's missed anything you could give her a ring
but she won't always answer the phone
oh but it's sad when a love affair dies
but we have pretended enough
it's best that we both stop fooling ourselves
which means ... !
there is no one , no one at all
never has been and never will be a lover , male or female
who hasn't an eye on
in fact they rely on tricks they can try on their partner
they're hoping their lover will help them or keep them
support them , promote them
don't blame them you're the same
good night and thank you , emilio
you've completed your task
what more can we ask of you now?
please sign the book on the way out the door
and that will be all lf she needs you , she'll call
but i don't think that's likely somehow
oh but it's sad when a love affair dies
but when we were hot we were hot
i know you'll look back on the good times we shared
which means ... !
there is no one , no one at all
never has been and never will be a lover
male or female
who hasn't an eye on ln fact they rely on
tricks they can try on their partner
they're hoping their lover will help them or keep them
support them , promote them
don't blame her you're the same
there is no soap no soap like zaz
no detergent , lotion or oil with such power
in the shower
it's the mother and father
of luxury lather
the talk of the bath the great ointment
one little frolic with new zaz carbolic
you're scented
you'll be sent
good night and thank you , senor jabn
we are grateful
you found her a spot on the sound radio
we'll think of you every time she's on the air
we'd love you to stay but you'd be in the way
so do up your trousers and go
oh but it's sad when a love affair dies
the decline into silence and doubt
our passion was just too intense to survive
which means ... !
this is a club i should never have joined
someone has made us look fools
argentine men call the sexual shots
someone has altered the rules
fame on the wireless as far as it goes
is all very well , but every girl knows
she needs a man she can monopolise
with fingers in dozens of different pies
in june of '43
there was a military coup
behind it was a gang called
the g. o. u.
who did not feel
the need to be elected
they had themselves a party at the point of a gun
they were slightly to the right of attila the hun
a bomb or two and very few objected
just one shell
and governments fall like flies
ka pow , die they stumble and fall
bye bye backs to the wall
aim high we're having a ball
the tank and bullet ruled as democracy died
the lady's got potential she was setting her sights
on making it in movies with her name in lights
the greatest social climber since cinderella
ok , she couldn't act but she had the right friends
and we all know a career depends
on knowing the right fella
to be stellar
just one shell and governments lose their nerve
that's how we get the government we deserve
now , the man behind the president calling the shots
involved so discreetly in a lot of their plots
was colonel juan pern
would be dictator
he began in the army out in ltaly so
saw mussolini's rise from the very front row
and reckoned he'd do likewise
sooner or later
just one blast and the tear gas falls like rain
they haven't a chance
the terrorists advance
but one guy doesn't dirty his hands
pern was biding time out
in the slow lane
suddenly an earthquake hit
the town of san juan
they stumble and fall
keep away from the wall
but one guy
was having a ball
the tragedy a golden chance for pern
he organised a concert with incredible flair
in aid of all the victims such a grand affair
politicians , actors stars of every flavour
it was january 22 , 1 944
a night to remember , that's for sure
for that's the night that pern first met eva
on this night
on this night
on this night of 1 000 stars
let me take you to heaven's door
where the music of love's guitars
plays for evermore
your act hasn't changed much
neither has yours
i stand here as a servant of the people
as we come together for a marvellous cause
you've shown by your presence
your deeds and applause
what the people can do
true power is yours not the government's
unless it represents
the people
one always picks
the easy fight
one praises fools
one smothers light
one shifts
from left to right
politics
the art of the possible
i've heard so much about you
i'm amazed
for i'm only an actress for i'm only a soldier
nothing to shout about one of the thousands
only a girl on the air defending the country he loves
but when you act
the things you do affect us all
but when you act
you take us away from the squalor of the real world
are you here on your own?
yes .
oh yes
so am i
what a fortunate coincidence
maybe you're my reward
for my efforts here tonight
it seems crazy
but you must believe
there's nothing calculated
nothing planned
please forgive me
if i seem naive
i would never want to force your hand
but please understand i'd be good for you
i don't always rush in like this 20 seconds after saying hello
telling strangers i'm too good to miss
if i'm wrong i hope you'll tell me so
but you really should know i'd be good for you
i'd be surprisingly good for you
i won't go on if i'm boring you
but do you understand my point of view
do you like what you hear what you see
and would you be
good for me too?
i'm not talking of a hurried night
a frantic tumble then a shy goodbye
creeping home before it gets too light
that's not the reason that i caught your eye
which has to imply i'd be good for you
please go on .
you enthral me
i can understand you perfectly
and i like what i hear , what i see
and knowing me
i would be good for you too
i'm not talking
of a hurried night
a frantic tumble
then a shy goodbye
creeping home before it gets too light
that's not the reason that i caught your eye
which has to imply i'd be good for you
there is no one , no one at all
never has been , and never will be a lover
male or female
who hasn't an eye on ln fact they rely on
tricks they can try on their partner
they're hoping their lover will help them or keep them
support them , promote them don't blame them , you're the same
hello and goodbye
i've just unemployed you
you can go back to school
you've had a good run
i'm sure he enjoyed you
don't act sad or surprised let's be friends , civilised
come on , little one don't sit there like a dummy
the day you knew would arrive is here
you'll survive
so move , funny face
i like your conversation
you've a catchy turn of phrase
you're obviously going through some adolescent phase
so what happens now?
where am i going to?
you'll get by , you always have before
don't ask any more
at the watering holes
of the well to do
i detect a resistance to
precisely
our heroine's style
we're glad you noticed
the shooting sticks
of the upper class
give her an inch ...
aren't supporting a single ass
that would rise for the girl ... she'll take a mile
such a shame she wandered
into our enclosure
how unfortunate this person
has forced us to be blunt
no , we wouldn't mind
seeing her at harrods
but behind the jewellery counter
not in front
could there be
in our fighting corps
a lack of enthusiasm for
pern's latest flame?
you said it , brother
should you wish
to cause great distress
in the tidiest officer's mess
just mention her name
that isn't funny
pern is a fool , breaking every taboo
installing the girl in the army h. q.
and she's an actress , the last straw
her only good parts are between her thighs
she should stare at the ceiling not reach for the skies
or she could be his last whore
the evidence suggests
she has other interests
if it's her that's using him
he's exceptionally dim
dangerous jade
we have allowed ourselves to slip
we have completely lost our grip
we have declined to an all time low
tarts have become the set to know
i'm only a radio star with just one weekly show
but speaking as one of the people
i want you to know
we are tired of
the decline of argentina
with no sign of
a government able to give us the things we deserve
it's no crime for officers to do as they please
as long as they're discreet and keep clear of disease
we ignore , we disregard
but once they allow a bit on the side
to move to the centre where she's not qualified
we are forced to mark his card
she should get into her head
she should not get out of bed
she should know that she's not paid
to be loud , but to be laid
slut
dangerous jade
this has really been your year miss duarte
tell us where you go from here miss duarte
which are the roles that you yearn to play?
whom did you sleep ... dine with yesterday?
acting is limiting the lines not mine
that's no help to the argentine
can we assume then that you'll quit?
is this because of your involvement
with colonel pern?
she won't be kept happy by her nights on the tiles
she says it's his body
but she's after his files
so get back onto the street
she should get into her head
she should not get out of bed
she should know that she's not paid
to be loud , but to be laid
the evidence suggests
she has other interests
if it's her that's using him
he's exceptionally dim
things have reached a pretty pass
when someone pretty lower class
graceless and vulgar , uninspired
can be accepted and admired
dice are rolling the knives are out
would be presidents are all around
i don't say they mean harm but they'd each give an arm
to see us six feet underground
it doesn't matter
what those morons say
our nation's leaders are a feeble crew
there's only 20 of them anyway
what is 20 next to millions who
are looking to you?
all you have to do is sit and wait
keeping out of everybody's way
we'll ...
you'll be handed power
on a plate
when the ones who matter have their say
and with chaos installed
you can reluctantly agree
to be called
there again we could be foolish
not to quit while we're ahead
for distance lends enchantment
and that is why
all exiles
are distinguished
more important , they're not dead
i could find job satisfaction in paraguay
this is crazy defeatist talk
why commit political suicide
there's no risk there's no call for any action at all
when you have unions on your side
a new argentina
the chains of the masses untied
the voice of the people
cannot be denied
there is only one man who can lead any workers 'regime
he lives for your problems he shares your ideals and your dream
he supports you , for he loves you
understands you , is one of you
if not
how could he love me?
a new argentina
the workers 'battle song
the voice of the people
rings out loud and long
now , i am a worker
i've suffered the way that you do
i've been unemployed and i've starved , and i've hated it too
but i found my salvation in pern
may the nation let him save them
as he saved me
a new age about to begin
we face the world together
and no dissent within
there again we could be foolish
not to quit while we're ahead
i can see us many miles away , inactive
sipping cocktails on a terrace
taking breakfast in bed
sleeping easy , doing nothing
it's attractive
don't think i don't think like you i often get those nightmares too
they always take some swallowing
sometimes it's very difficult to keep momentum , if it's you that you are following
don't close doors keep an escape clause
because we might lose
the big apple
but would i have done what i did
if i hadn't thought
if i hadn't known
we would take the country?
pern has resigned from the army and this we avow
the descamisados are those he is marching with now
he supports you , for he loves you
understands you , is one of you
if not
how could he love me?
release him .
how annoying that they have to fight elections
for their cause
the inconvenience
having to get a majority
if normal methods of persuasion
fail to win them applause
there are other ways of establishing authority
your newly elected president juan pern
we are all workers now
fighting against our common enemies
poverty , social injustice ...
foreign domination of our industries
reaching for our common goals
our independence , our dignity
our pride
let the world know
that our great nation is awakening
and that its heart beats in the humble bodies
of juan pern
and his wife
the first lady of argentina
eva
duarte
de pern
it won't be easy
you'll think it strange
when i try to explain how i feel
that i still need your love
after all that i've done
you won't believe me
all you will see is a girl you once knew
although she's dressed up to the nines
at sixes and sevens with you
i had to let it happen
i had to change
couldn't stay all my life down at heel
looking out of the window
staying out of the sun
so i chose freedom
running around
trying everything new
but nothing
impressed me at all
i never expected it to
don't cry for me , argentina
the truth is
i never left you
all through my wild days
my mad existence
i kept my promise
don't keep your distance
and as for fortune
and as for fame
i never invited them in
though it seemed to the world
they were all i desired
they are illusions
they're not
the solutions they promised to be
the answer was here all the time
i love you
and hope you love me
have i said too much?
there's nothing more i can think of to say to you
but all you have to do is
look at me to know
that every word is true
just listen to that
the voice of argentina
we are adored , we are loved
statesmanship is more than entertaining peasants
we shall see , little man
i am only a simple woman who lives to serve pern in his noble crusade to rescue his people .
i was once as you are now , and i promise you this , we will take the riches from the oligarchs .
only for you , for all of you .
and one day you too will inherit these treasures !
when they fire those cannons , when crowds sing of glory , it is not just for pern but for all of us !
for all of us !
things have reached a pretty pass
when someone pretty lower class
can be respected and admired
but our privileged class is dead
look who they are calling for now
high flying , adored
so young , the instant queen
a rich , beautiful thing
of all the talents a cross between
a fantasy of the bedroom
and a saint
you were just a back street girl
hustling and fighting
scratching and biting
high flying , adored
did you believe in your wildest moments
all this would be yours
that you'd become the lady of them all?
were there stars in your eyes
when you crawled in at night
from the bars , from the sidewalks
from the gutter theatrical?
don't look down
it's a long , long way to fall
what happens now?
where do you go from here?
for someone on top of the world
the view is not exactly clear
a shame you did it all
at 26
there are no mysteries now
nothing can thrill you no one fulfil you
high flying , adored
i hope you come to terms with boredom
so famous , so easily
so soon
is not the wisest thing to be
you won't care if they love you
it's been done before
you'll despair
if they hate you
you'll be drained of all energy
all the young who've made it
would agree
high flying , adored
that's good to hear , but unimportant
my story's quite usual
local girl
makes good , weds famous man
i was slap in the right place
at the perfect time
filled a gap , i was lucky
but one thing i'll say for me
no one else can fill it like i can
there again i've more to do
than simply get the message through i haven't started
let's get this show on the road
let's make it obvious
pern is off and rolling
eyes , hair
mouth , figure
dress , voice
style , movement
hands , magic
rings , glamour
face , diamonds excitement , image
i came from the people
they need to adore me
so christian dior me
from my head to my toes
i need to be dazzling
i want to be rainbow high
they must have excitement
and so must i
i'm their product , it's vital to sell me
so machiavell me make an argentine rose
i need to be thrilling
i want to be rainbow high
they need their escape , and so do i
all my descamisados expect me to outshine the enemy
i won't disappoint them
i'm their saviour
that's what they call me
so lauren bacall me anything goes
to make me fantastic
i have to be rainbow high
in magical colours
you're not decorating a girl
for a night on the town
and i'm not a second rate queen
getting kicks with a crown
next stop will be europe
the rainbow's gonna tour
look out , mighty europe
because you ought to know what you're gonna get in me
people of europe
i send you the rainbow of argentina
spain has fallen to the charms of evita
she can do what she likes it doesn't matter much
she's our lady of the new world with a golden touch
she filled a bull ring 45, 000 seater
but if you're prettier than general franco
that's not hard
franco's reign in spain
should see out the '40s
so you've just acquired an ally
who looks as secure in his job as you
but more important
current political thought is
your wife's a phenomenal asset
your trump card
let's hear it for the rainbow tour
it's been an incredible success
we weren't quite sure we had a few doubts
will evita win through?
but the answer is yes
there you are , i told you so
makes no difference where she goes
the whole world over , just the same
just listen to them call her name
and who would underestimate
the actress now?
now , i don't like to spoil a wonderful story
but the news from rome lsn't quite as good
she hasn't gone down like they thought she would
italy's unconvinced
by argentine glory
they equate pern with mussolini
can't think why
did you hear that?
they called me a whore
they actually called me a whore
but senora pern
it's an easy mistake
i'm still called an admiral
yet i gave up the sea long ago
more bad news from rome
she met with the pope
she only got a rosary
a kindly word
i wouldn't say the holy father gave her the bird
but papal decorations
never a hope
she still looked the part at st. peter's caught the eye
eva started well , no question , in france
shining like a sun through the post war haze
a beautiful reminder of the carefree days
she nearly captured the french
she sure had the chance
but she suddenly seemed to lose interest
she looked tired
face the facts
the rainbow started to fade
i don't think she'll make it to england now
it wasn't on the schedule anyhow
you'd better get out the flags
and fix a parade
some kind of coming home in triumph is required
let's hear it for the rainbow tour
it's been an incredible success
we weren't quite sure
we had a few doubts
would evita win through?
and the answer is yes
and no
thus all fairy stories end
only an actress would pretend
affairs of state are her latest play
eight shows a week , two matinees
my , how the world begins to turn
when will the chorus girl ever learn?
the chorus girl
hasn't learned the lines you'd like to hear
she won't go scrambling
over the backs of the poor
to be accepted
by making donations
just large enough
to the correct charity
she won't be president
of your wonderful societies of philanthropy
even if you asked her to be
as you should have asked her to be
the actress hasn't learned the lines
you'd like to hear
she won't join your clubs
she won't dance in your halls
she won't help the hungry once a month
at your tombolas
she'll simply take control
as you disappear
forgive my intrusion
but fine as those sentiments sound
little has changed for us peasants
down here on the ground
i hate to sound childish , ungrateful
i don't like to moan
but do you now represent
anyone's cause but your own?
everything done
will be justified by my foundation
and the money kept rolling in
from every side
eva's pretty hands reached out and they reached wide
now you may feel it should have been
a voluntary cause
but that's not the point , my friends
when the money keeps rolling in you don't ask how
think of all the people guaranteed a good time now
eva has called the hungry to her
opened up the doors
never been a fund like the foundation eva pern
rolling , rolling , rolling
rolling on in
would you like to try a college education?
own your landlord's house take the family on vacation?
eva and her blessed fund
can make your dreams come true
here's all you have to do , my friends
write your name and your dream on a card or a pad or a ticket
throw it high in the air and should our lady pick it
she will change your way of life
for a week or even two
name me anyone who cares as much as eva pern
the money kept rolling out in all directions
to the poor , to the weak to the destitute of all complexions
now , cynics claim a little of the cash has gone astray
but that's not the point , my friends
when the money keeps rolling out you don't keep books
you can tell you've done well by the happy , grateful looks
accountants only slow things down
figures get in the way
never been a lady loved as much as eva pern
pern is everything .
he's the soul , the nerve , the hope and the reality of the argentine people .
we all know that there is only one man in our movement with his own source of light , we all feed from his light , and that is pern .
and now she wants to be
vice president
that was the over the top unacceptable suggestion
we didn't approve but we couldn't prevent
the games of the wife of the president
but to give her intentions
encouragement
she's out of her depth
and out of the question
but on the other hand
she's all they have
she's a diamond in their
dull , grey lives
and that's the hardest kind of stone
it usually survives
and when you think about it ...
can you recall
the last time they loved
anyone at all?
she's not a bauble
you can brush aside
she's been out doing
what we just talked about
example : gave us back our businesses
got the english out
and when you think about it ...
well , why not do
one or two of the things
we promised to?
but on the other hand
she's slowing down
she's lost a little of that magic drive
but i would not advise those critics present
to derive
any satisfaction from her fading star
she's the one who's kept us
where we are
she's the one who's kept you
where you are
turn a blind eye , evita turn a blind eye
please , gentle eva
will you bless a little child?
for i love you
tell heaven i'm doing my best
i'm praying for you
even though you're already blessed
please , mother eva
will you look upon me as your own?
make me special
be my angel , be my everything
wonderful , perfect and true
and i'll try to be
exactly like you
turn a blind eye , evita
why try to govern a country
when you can become a saint?
tell me before i waltz out of your life
before turning my back on the past
forgive my impertinent behaviour
but how long do you think this pantomime can last?
tell me before i ride off in the sunset
there's one thing i never got clear
how can you claim you're our saviour
when those who oppose you are stepped on or cut up
or simply disappear?
tell me before you get onto your bus
before joining the forgotten brigade
how can one person like me , say
alter the time honoured way the game is played?
tell me before you get onto your high horse
just what you expect me to do
i don't care what the bourgeoisie say
i'm not in business for them
but to give all my descamisados
a magical moment or two
there is evil
ever around , fundamental
system of government quite incidental
so what are my chances of honest advances?
i'd say low
better to win by admitting my sin
than to lose with a halo
tell me before i seek worthier pastures
and thereby restore self esteem
how can you be so short sighted
to look never further than this week or next week
to have no impossible dream?
allow me to help you slink off to the sidelines
i'll mark your adieu with three cheers
but first tell me who'd be delighted
if i said i'd take on the world's greatest problems
from war to pollution no hope of solution
even if i lived for 1 00 years
there is evil
ever around , fundamental
system of government quite incidental
so go , if you're able
to somewhere unstable
and stay there
whip up your hate ln some tottering state
but not here , dear ls that clear , dear?
oh what i'd give for 1 00 years
but the physical interferes
every day more
oh my creator
what is the good
of the strongest heart
in a body that's falling apart?
a serious flaw
i hope you know that
your little body's slowly breaking down
you're losing speed
you're losing strength not style
that goes on flourishing forever
but your eyes , your smile
do not have the sparkle of your fantastic past
if you climb one more mountain
it could be your last
i'm not that ill
bad moments come
but they go
some days are fine
some a little bit harder
but that doesn't mean
we should give up our dream
have you ever seen me defeated?
don't you forget
what i've been through , and yet ...
i'm still standing
eva , you're dying
so what happens now?
where am i going to?
don't ask any more
where do we go from here?
this isn't where we intended to be
we had it all
you believed in me
i believed in you
certainties disappear
what do we do for our dream to survive?
how do we keep all our passions alive as we used to do?
deep in my heart i'm concealing
things that i'm longing to say
scared to confess what i'm feeling
frightened you'll slip away
you must love me
why are you at my side?
how can i be any use to you now?
give me a chance and i'll let you see how
nothing has changed
the actress
hasn't learned the lines
you'd like to hear
she's sad for her country
sad to be defeated
by her own weak body
i want to tell the people
of argentina
i've decided
i should decline
all the honours and titles
you've pressed me to take
for i'm contented
let me simply go on
as the woman who brings her people
to the heart of pern
the truth is i shall not leave you
though it may get harder
for you to see me
i'm argentina
and always will be
have i said too much?
there's nothing more i can think of
to say to you
but all you have to do
is look at me to know
that every word
is true
she had her moments
she had some style
the best show in town was the crowd
outside the casa rosada they're crying , " eva pern
but that's all gone now
the choice was mine
and mine completely
i could have any prize
that i desired
i could burn
with the splendour
of the brightest fire
or else , or else i could choose time
remember?
i was very young then
and a year
was forever
and a day
so what use could
70 be?
i saw the lights
and i was on my way
and how i lived
how they shone
but how soon
the lights were gone
the choice was yours
and no one else's
you can cry for a body
in despair
hang your head
because she is no longer there
to shine , or dazzle , or betray
how she lived
how she shone
but how soon
the lights were gone
eyes , hair
face , image
all must be preserved
still life displayed forever
no less
than she deserved
