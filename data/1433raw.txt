emergency .
which serice do you require , please?
help ...
behind me is brabourne school , ... .. where news is just in that the missing teenagers have been found after 18 days .
now the waiting is finally over .
the four teenagers attend brabourne school , ... .. where fees are in excess of $30, 000 a year .
unconfirmed reports say they have been taken to a local hospital , ... .. where their families have been anxiously waiting .
michael steel , son of rock guitarist stevie steel , was one of the missing .
liz .
liz !
see you inside .
he's going to kill us !
no !
liz ...
no !
stop !
hi .
i'm dr horwood .
i'm here to help you .
thanks .
don't put me on prozac or lithium .
i'm not crazy .
it's just my mum , she won't listen .
i'll listen .
do i have to talk about it today?
you make it sound so terrible .
if you trust me and you work with me , ... .. l really think i can help you feel better .
so we do this at your speed , yeah?
we can stop at any time .
i won't lie to you : this is going to be difficult , ... .. but i know that you're brave enough to get through it .
let's try a breathing exercise .
it might seem really ... stupid , but let's just give it a bash , ok?
take a nice deep breath .
feel your lungs fill up with air .
good .
drop your shoulders .
and when you exhale , tell all the muscles in your body to relax .
and whenever you feel ready , just start to speak .
ok?
this is how it works at brabourne .
if you want to exist , you have to be pretty .
you have to be thin .
everyone else is wallpaper .
foryears i was a nobody .
i watched the world from the edges and learned not to dream .
oh , is he?
my best friend , martin , didn't care .
take everything you can from them .
he said that theirgreed makes them easy to control .
it made him powerful .
but then the world changed .
get ready , girls .
mike steel is single again .
oh , my god !
mike steel .
american .
the son ofa rock star .
the missing part ofmy soul .
get up !
please get up .
please , please be ok .
get up .
sorry , mate .
i see why this lot need to wear body armour .
it's a homoerotic thing .
all that aggression out here , ... .. then all that steam and soap in the showers .
that's disgusting .
right , you two !
off !
maybe geoff will be mike's new bride .
for your information , martin , he's dating a supermodel called amber .
for yours , he's not .
you lie .
don't you live here?
haven't you noticed that suddenly everyone's a blonde with cherry lip gloss?
there's been an invasion of amber clones .
it's passed you by , thank god .
you're the last woman with a brain in brabourne .
he's single?
half a brain .
yes .
oh , not you , too , liz .
please don't lose it .
i didn't know .
but he's just a guy like me .
you wouldn't think he was so perfect if you knew him .
he shits and farts like the rest of us .
he's just a fuck of a lot less interesting !
i can't help it .
it's an egg thing .
when i look at mike , i see the face of an angel ... .. and the soul of a poet .
i need him .
no , no , no .
no , you love me .
it's a martin taylor fact .
has there been a day in the last five years that we haven't talked?
but you're more like a gay friend than a boyfriend .
but i'm not gay !
yeah , right
it's the end of term , i've got some grateful exes to call ... .. and most importantly , i am out of here .
hello there is the small matter of the geography field trip .
mm .
bentley , school gates , friday .
off to la .
bye !
nice time .
oh , you are such a jockey .
stevie will have a shitfit if you don't go .
you think i'm gonna tell him?
i'm gonna lie low in a hotel .
he'll never know .
my arse .
tabloids are gagging for you .
you are having a wet weekend in wales ... with no hot water , fish paste sandwiches and ten mile tabs , like it or not .
hm .
that's awful dark , geoffrey .
shit , i don't want to go either .
we have to ditch .
i'm serious .
this could kill me .
frankie's not going .
she saw wellies on the kit list and nearly had a seizure .
how'd she get out of it?
well , she saw martin taylor .
you know what i want show me the money
frankie?
frankie?
i need to talk to you .
come .
what's she done this time?
my hair .
it's all gone wrong .
i've messed up .
let me see .
what , did your mobile give you a tumour?
do you mind?
my coursework doesn't write itself , you know .
what is it?
intensive conditioner .
it should have you sorted in 20 minutes .
what did you use?
peroxide .
where from?
the lab .
oh , lizzie .
i just thought if i was a blonde like amber , then ...
i don't mean to be rude , but i don't think doing stuff to yourself ... .. will make any difference to mike .
no , ...
i know .
oh , don't worry about it .
trust me , he's not that wonderful .
frankie?
thanks .
i know you don't have to be nice to me .
don't worry about it .
my life has no meaning .
come in , sit down .
make yourself at home .
i love him and he doesn't even know i exist .
i hate seeing you like this .
hey , i can cheer you up .
i've got chocolate .
martin , you don't understand .
you've never been in love .
you've never had the pain .
god , i feel like i'm dying .
i can help you .
really?
really .
welcome to my office .
now , this is a need to know operation .
can you do it or not?
no field trip , ... .. no parents , no paparazzi?
i can do anything .
and , er ... .. l'm adding one to your number .
a kindred spirit .
martin knew that the school and ourparents always believed each other .
he called it the unholy alliance .
if ourparents thought we were in wales and the school thought we were at home , ... .. they'd never question it .
baby
see me
call , baby
you seem cold , oh
i fall
ln love bye !
come , please
hold me goodbye
aye , aye , here come the troops .
jesus , you're late !
did anyone see you?

liz .
frankie you know , geoff i'm sure you've heard of .
none of it is true .
except that one about the butter .
and mike .
well , call me a muppet , mate , but there's nothing here .
i'm not spending all weekend sitting on a tree trunk .
you can't see the wood for the trees .
is he taking the piss?
are you taking the piss , martin?
i could snap your neck like that , mate .

i'm not hungry .
you've got to have something .
didn't really bring anything .
you didn't bring any food?

how will you survive on gum for three days?
it slipped my mind .
it didn't occur to me .
ok , so food slipped your mind .
i've got food .
i've got sausages and beans and noodles .
plenty for everyone .
you can have as much as you want .
you have sausages?
do you have tomato sauce?

frankie?

i'm on a diet .
i've got fibre pills to stop me feeling hungry .
yum
ok , it's my turn .
my friend was driving his girlfriend in his ferrari ...
who do you know with a ferrari?
bob and sally .
you don't know them .
bob and who?
mike , don't !
fuck off .
really , relax .
bob and sally went for a drive , but they ran out of petrol in the middle of nowhere .
so bob went to find some .
sally was left in the car .
she switched on the radio ... .. and they said there was like this crazy madman on the loose .
but she was really tired ...
man with a hook .
on the roof of the car .
with bob's head on a stick .
on a hook !
no , this really happened !
oh , yeah , yeah , yeah , frankie
ok , i've got one for you .
make you cack your pants .
what? !
shut up , man .
something happens to martin .
doesn't come back for us .
told you .
that's sick .
possible .
don't be stupid .
geoff , you shouldn't say that .
what if you make it happen?
how can i make anything happen when i'm here with you?
you'll jinx us .
how?
it's tempting fate !
oh , please how does that work?
lizzie?
i'm a scientist .
i don't believe in fate .
mike?
i'm a scientologist .
i'm with liz .
oh , yes !
fine !
but if anything happens to martin , it's geoff's fault , ok?
if that's what it takes to get you to shut up about it , fine .
fine .
fine .
is my story the best , or what?
ole , ole ole ole !
liz .
bingham , bingham liz .
what happened on the third day?
don't you want to know what we did?
martin was supposed to let you out , wasn't he?
liz?
liz .
i don't know !
what don't you know?
i don't know what happened .
come on , you're quite safe here .
deep breaths .
look at me .
it's the third day .
you're packed and ready to go .
what's the time now?
same as when you asked two minutes ago .
well , it can't be the same time if two minutes have passed , can it?
it's 3 . 32 , then .
so where is he?
the field trip's supposed to be back in 30 minutes .
i have a driver waiting .
this is so ...
what if he's been hit by a bus , is in a coma and can't tell anyone where we are?
oh , please .
oh , my god .
what if he's dead?
he's not dead !
i'll call him .
what's his number?
they don't work down here !
here , give me your phone .
let me try .
you get anything?
no , nothing .
maybe give it a shot up by the door .
does it work?
no , nothing .
you've jinxed us .
i knew you would .
this is a wind up .
no , this is your fault !
you never should have said those things !
hey !
you guys !
have you thought that maybe the traffic's heavy?
it's cool , i'm not worried .
help !
help !
geoff !
open the door !
everyone just calm ...
he's just trying to help !
what do you think i'm trying to do?
please !
shut up and let me get on with it !
you're stinking mad .
hey !
hey .
we're nowhere closer !
hit it with the pipe , then .
i'll tell you what .
why don't you have a go , darling?
go on !
ok , so they know we never went to wales .
as far as they know , we have a three day head start , ... .. which means they could be covering a three day radius of the school .
that covers ... .. like , the whole world .
so what do we do?
we're being held to ransom until martin says so .
we can't do anything .
don't say that !
i mean , he could just be ill .
isn't that right , lizzie?
i don't know .
why would he do this?
we're his friends !
are we?
is he really your friend , frankie?
he's not mine .
think about it .
i don't know a thing about him .
he has no morals , no ethics .
everything's just a game to him .
oh , so this is a game?
oh , that's great !
that's fucking wonderful
oh , my god , i paid for this .
yeah , but he's careful .
nothing's left to chance .
right now , we're trapped because he wants us trapped .
why?
well , i guess we're gonna find out .
liz .
look at me .
he didn't come back .
martin didn't come back .
you've cracked it !
i knew you would .
i told the lads .
this fucking great cheer went up .
a bloody schoolboy , i said .
little lord bloody fauntleroy !
good job , doctor .
thanks , detective .
the hunt for the kidnapper of the brabourne teenagers ... .. took an unexpected turn today , ... .. as it was announced that police have arrested a pupil from the school .
the boy , who cannot be named for legal reasons , ... .. was located in the dominican republic , ... .. where it is believed he was on holiday with his family .
i've put together a rough character sketch based on the information we have .
locking the children in suggests a sociopathic personality .
he doesn't think what he's done is wrong .
he probably thinks he's above the law .
right now he's probably creating a very strong alibi .
so the longer he has to conjure up this fiction , the harder it'll be to crack .
if you want a confession , you'll have to act quickly .
so , ... .. when the police arrest martin , will they put him in a cell?
i presume so .
good .
i hope they do .
let's see how he likes it .
all right , let's start .
er ... hang on .
ok , i'm ready .
can we talk?
sure .
shall i come over there?
ok .
can i get in?
what's up?
can't sleep?
it ... it's about martin .
i think he's watching us .
i saw ... a shadow pass the slat .
it could be nothing , i ...
i could be wrong ... .. but i think it might have been him checking up on us .
it probably is him .
it's so funny .
y'know , stevie sent me here to protect me from the nut jobs at home .
i think i know what martin's doing .
go on .
martin wants me to see that ... .. it was stupid of me to like you when i don't even know you .
he wants me to hate you .
we're still down here because he was wrong .
he hates being wrong , ... .. so we're stuck down here till he's right .
hold on .
you knew this would happen even before we came down here?
no , of course not .
but it's the only explanation i can think of .
but what difference does it make?
he likes you , doesn't he?
yeah .
since we were eleven .
one of those .
yeah .
but you ... .. like me?
yeah .
sorry .
don't worry about it .
but ... how does he know you don't hate me?
i mean ...
i don't ...
how could he work that out from a split second at the door?
i don't know .
what is it?
what?
is that what i think it is?
yeah .
are there more?
whoa .
try that one over there .
which one?
this one .
he's covered the whole place .
jesus christ !
what's going on?
what is it?
liz , it's the middle of the night !
what?
i'm really worried about her .
she needs a doctor .
that's obvious i thought you were supposed to be smart .
i bet it's that dirty toilet water that's making her ill .
it's not my fault !
yes , it is !
this is shit !
this is the worst time i've ever had !
i hope i never see you again .
it's not that bad !
no !
things are very bad !
i mean , am i the only one who can smell the toilet?
who left the monster log that we can't fucking flush?
we're fucked , and it's all your fucking fault !
why me?
because he's your best friend !
yeah !
i should've never came down here .
as soon as i saw you , ... .. you fucking geeky little fucking bitch , ... .. l should've turned the other fucking way !
just stay the fuck away from me , you fucking loser !
you're not so great yourself , you know .
you're full of shit !
what are you , anyway?
you're just a face ... and hair !
oh , shut up , you ... .. fuckin '... .. comebag !
we waited and waited , and nothing happened .
but it worked .
the next morning mike woke me up and the door was open .
we were so happy .
we were out .
we all grabbed each other andjust stood in the light .
it was over .
we'd beaten him .
we'd won .
what martin didn't realise was that i'd even won mike .
we ran up as quickly as we could .
mike gave me a great big hug and he said " you saved us .
" you saved us all .
you saved us all .
here we are .
right .
well done .
i told you you'd get through it .
how do you feel?
lighter .
last night i even closed the door all the way and i didn't panic .
excellent .
you've made a lot of progress .
we've still got a lot of work to do .
oh?
yeah , but you'll get there .
it's ... it's really good .
i'll see you later .
ok?
bye .
bye .
yeah , tom here .
tom , it's philippa .
what can i do foryou?
listen , she thinks she spent the last week in fucking disneyland !
oh , yeah?
i'm sorry .
i didn't see it coming .
doesn't matter , i'll get a confession out ofmartin , no problem .
i mean , how delusional can she be?
so i suppose you've got fingerprints?
dna?
cctv footage of me creeping around or a stack of witnesses with 20/ 20
do you even have a motive?
a bloody good reason why i should lock up a bunch of socialites ... .. and throw away the key , however tempting that might be?
what did you do on the last day of term?
is she deaf?
is she thick?
i mean , can they really keep asking the same question hour after hour?
please .
just so we're clear .
i got up at 7am as usual .
i cleaned my teeth and had a shit .
i was down at breakfast by 7 . 20am , as usual .
the matron ticked me off the list , ... .. l had two slices of cold toast with warm butter and sweet tea as usual .
i returned to my study and carried my bags to the school minibus at 8am ... .. and was sat on the minibus by 8 . 05 .
i sat beside the driver because i wanted to sit on my own .
we left for the station at 8 . 30am and arrived at a not unreasonable 8 . 45am .
i bought a telegraph and a kit kat ... .. and then caught my train promptly at 9 . 05 from platform two .
i was alone until charing cross , where i was met by my mother , ... .. who parked the car in the wrong area and got a ticket as usual .
martin .
we know why you did it , how you did it , the whole fucking lot .
elizabeth has told us everything .
hey?
well , i knew she was fucked in the head , but i didn't realise she was this vicious .
well , you ... you know liz hates me .
you do know that , don't you?
thanks for taking me home .
i can't wait to get into my own bed .
you'll feel better once you get back into your old routine .
now , if you need anything , day or night , just call me , all right?
you can go back any time you want .
i have to get back to the real world .
you said so yourself .
you really don't know anything , do you?
liz and frankie are best friends !
they're thick as thieves !
you're sure?
they're practically the same person !
boring , vain , shallow enough to paddle in .
but liz is the really nasty one .
do you have a pen?
this is how it is at brabourne .
to exist , you eitherhave to be a bitch ora complete slut .
what is it?
amber dumped mike half an hour ago .
oh , fuck .
come on .
it's the big chance you've been waiting for !
oh , my god , i'm going to be sick .
move quick , girl , or you'll be auditioning with every peekaboo slut from london up .
i don't just want him .
i really want him , frankie .
i've got a plan .
let's hear it .
we go to the beach again like last year .
but this time we camp out .
it'll be perfect .
the sea air , the stars ...
i hate beaches .
all that sand up your crack and nowhere to pee apart from the ocean .
and it dries out the complexion .
i'll look 40 after ten minutes and you want me to go for a week?
remember that place we found and said it'd be great for a party?
the s& m dungeon martin tried to take you to?
precisely .
what if we did that?
i could get mike pretty much on his own for a few days ... .. and we could even ask geoff ... for you .
the four of us?
yeah .
a private party , the end of term .
me , you , mike and geoff .
oi , oi , frankie !
.. up his arse with a rampant penis
wahey !
dangerous place for a lady .
if you say so .
whooo !
out .
neil , out !
she's not here for you .
see you , geoff .
couldn't have come at a better time .
i'm ready if you are .
how would you like to go to the best private party of your life?
are you going?
it's my party .
how private?
you , me , ... .. mike and liz .
mike never mentioned it .
that's cos you're inviting him .
i don't know if i could do that .
it's for three days .
absolutely extracurricular .
your parents don't know and the school doesn't know .
what we do would be our own business .
but if you're too pussy , then i'll ask someone else .
i never said i wasn't interested .
in or out?
in .
but you have to bring mike .
i'll have a word with his highness .
anything else?
put your knob away .
go .
did you do it?
yeah .
done .
it will be great .
oh , please
man , i'm telling you , this is different .
this is ten out of ten .
frankie and liz .
real ten out of ten
so you're going home to an empty house and fuck the maid again?
you haven't seen the maid .
plus ... .. amber won't know where you are .
won't be able to find you .
she'll assume you're having a more exciting time with more famous people .
it'll drive her nuts .
all right .
i'm in .
when you're convinced ofyoursuperiority , ... .. you don't need help from mere mortals like me .
you can fuck things up all byyourself .
so there you have it .
i thank you .
what time did you lock them in the hole?
because i know you did it .
how dare you be this wrong and this fucking pig headed !
how dare you put my mother through this !
how do you know it was me?
i'm dying to know !
come on !
one of them is lying .
i have to talk to her .
she can tell me what i need to know .
i understand .
but if you start demanding things , ... .. she could go back to that stony silence bullshit .
that's a risk i have to take .
i've nothing on martin .
in 12 hours , he walks .
tom , if you say one word to her , i will fucking kill you !
just let me go .
i'll get the answers .
he's going to get away with it , isn't he?
no .
you mustn't think like that .
did he ever keep a diary or journal , or anything like that?
i don't think so .
did he have a secret hiding place?
no , i don't know .
why?
what's wrong?
you're not going to let him out , are you?
i'm afraid that's not my decision .
he's going to come after me !
he won't , liz .
you're perfectly safe .
is he out now?
no , but he will be in a couple of hours .
hours? !
that's why i really need you to remember .
you said i'd be safe .
you are safe .
i trusted you !
i thought we were friends !
i told you everything !
you've been pretending the whole time because you're paid to !
that's not true .
leave me alone !
i can help you .
nice one .
you don't want to be found , do you?
shave yourhead )
sweeties !
geoff , pass it up !
give it here !
you want it , you got it , baby !
we're watching you )
we're watching you
hi .
so ... who do you want first?
what are you talking about , mikey?
i'm dancing .
wrong approach , mate .
frankie , i've got something for you .
oh , fuck off , geoffrey !
stop being such a fucking tourist .
i am not .
jesus .
is there sex or not?
not .
and especially not with you .
and especially not in here .
have you seen how dirty it is?
yeah , i have .
and why would there be sex?
i mean , what have you done for me?
no , i don't think so .
sorry .
look , frankie , y'know , we've had a lot of anticipation .
and it's medically proven that teasing can ruin a young man's nuts .
fuck off , i've heard this all before !
so you have to .
oh , shit !
hello !
are you all right?
i need some more !
whoa , whoa , whoa !
i'm goin 'first !
come on , get it off .
come on !
ooh , careful !
it's expensive !
now i've wanted to see this for the last four years .
frankie .
i've had this .
it's ok .
what , seven?
eight out of ten?
mm ... four .
oh , thank you
frankie !
we were , what , 13?
i mean , it was a one night stand .
it wasn't exactly memorable .
it was a long time ago and i'm a lot better now .
but you liked it .
uh huh .
ow !
what the fuck is wrong with you?
you fuckin 'nut job !
yes , oh , yes !
lizzie !
thank you !
how does it go?
that's it , no more free feels .
you must be joking .
what am i meant to do with the old man?
suck it off , big boy .
whoa !
ten out of ten !
ten out of ten .
what?
what did she do?
oh , go on , give us a look , franks .
what did she do?
nothing .
oh , come on , do it again !
forget it , it's supposed to be a party .
it's a shit party , but it's a party nonetheless .
you always get to see everything .
why's it always you?
i never get to see the good bits .
can't we have the light on?
no !
i can't sleep if it's light .
well , it's too dark to sleep !
how can it be?
shut your eyes .
well , i can't tell when my eyes are open or closed , it's so fucking dark !
oh , shit !
shh !
it's only me .
never fear , geoff's here .
what?
can we get some sleep , please !
will you shut up !
what are you doing?
mm ...
turn the light off .
she must have spent days picking the lock , but she did it .
she beat him and i'll beat him too .
little shit ofa schoolboy .
his website , " disciples of chaos , " ... .. is anarchist bullshit about disrupting stock exchanges , air traffic control , ... .. the web itself .
i'm gonna nail him .
i don't think he's angry enough to have done it .
hi .
thanks for meeting me .
no problem .
shall we go straight there?
sure .
it's not far , it's just up the hill .
i'm not great with small spaces .
neither am l .
i can't stand them .
but that will be the least of your worries when you get down there .
what were they doing here?
trying to have a good time .
they had plenty of booze , they'd wired up some party lights .
the prime suspect has been released without charge .
the police have yet to make any formal statement ... .. and it is understood that investigations are proceeding satisfactorily .
the families have requested that the press res ...
god .
you can't go !
the trip doesn't get back for two days !
mate , you said you'd do this .
fuck the trip .
ok , yeah , fuck things up for the rest of us .
do something !
get him to stay !
i don't know what to do !
i won't tell anyone , ok?
please don't go .
you'll ruin everything .
look , i'm not gonna stay down here and listen to you fuck each other's brains out .
i'm trying .
i'm leaving too !
not you as well
i'm not playing gooseberry .
i'm not staying down here .
are you going straight home?
we could stop by the station and get a pizza .
i'm starving .
no .
thanks , though .
c'mon , trains go to london all the time .
yeah , no .
i ...
i know .
i'm gonna go by amber's , see if we can patch things up .
things have been awful .
amber?
but she humiliated you .
how the fuck would you know anything about that?
enjoy yourselves .
i'm outta here .
hey , mikey?
your weed , mate .
mate , you said you'd do this .
you said it'd be fun .
it is !
for you .
you'll have a great weekend .
we could have fun .
please .
you're gonna get laid .
enjoy this .
come on , mike .
please .
stay .
you're gonna have a great time .
you'll be here completely by yourselves .
enjoy it , all right?
i hate him .
what's up , liz?
something's wrong !
i can't open the door !
can you move out of the way?
watch this .
fuck !
it won't open .
well , push it , you twat .
the handle's stuck .
you are such a donkey , mate .
oi , liz !
down .
let me sort it out .
you are such a cretin .
look , i'm not fucking retarded , ok?
the fucking door won't open !
get out of the way !
who was the last one down?
it was geoff .
how fucking hard did you slam it?
it wasn't me , it was liz !
it's a heavy door !
it slammed itself .
doors don't just slam themselves locked .
hello !
sorry !
i didn't know we'd get stuck , did l?
this is bullshit !
you're sorry? !
that's just fucking great
what do we do?
do we just fucking rot?
i guess ... we just wait to be found .
in two days , my parents are going to be up there waiting for me .
if i'm not there , they'll know i told a pack of lies and i'll be up to my arse in shit !
good point .
my parents'll go berserk !
good fucking job , asshole !
how long before we're found?
i don't know !
shit !
i am in so much trouble !
perfect
help !
anyone !
help !
somebody try the glass .
we have to do something that might open the fucking door !
well , what'll we fucking do?
fucking bitch !
you fucking bitch !
you all right?
why don't we sit down?
thanks .
it's been a nightmare for forensics .
they can barely lift a usable print .
it'll take us six months to sift through all the hair and fibre we lifted .
what about the listening devices?
the kids probably mistook the small air vents for microphones .
lack of food and water would have made them confused and paranoid .
so do you have anything to tie martin taylor to the scene?
not yet .
but he will have left something somewhere .
and we'll find it .
right .
thanks .
open the door !
you bitch !
open the door !
liz !
liz !
liz !
sorry !
sorry !
i'm sorry !
bullshit !
bullshit !
i'm sorry !
how could you do this to me , lizzie?
you fucking betrayed me !
no !
they let you go !
i knew they would !
they've tapped my phone , they tried to follow me here !
they want me for the whole thing !
they can't prove anything !
if they could , they would have by now !
you grassed me up , you bitch !
hello?
hello?
what happened?
you've got to get me out of here !
please .
i don't feel safe .
i don't want to be alone .
i don't feel safe .
all right .
all right .
liz ...
please .
please !
liz , come on .
calm down .
take a deep breath .
come on .
calm down .
listen , i can help you , but you've got to stop playing games .
some people need to know what happened .
they don't care how terrible your story is .
they want to know the truth .
i want to know the truth too !
i want to go back to the hole .
absolutely not !
no way .
i keep getting glimpses of what happened .
i'll be doing something like tying my laces and i'll turn around ... and i'll see frankie .
but when i try to remember , i can't .
there's nothing .
nothing at all .
and i don't know what happened .
i want to know , but i can't remember .
do you want to be re admitted?
and we can work through this .
no .
i need to go back to the hole .
there's no escape , tom .
mrs dunn called again , ... .. pissing and moaning dr horwood's run away with her child .
saying she'll call the press , the complaints commission , if we don't find her !
all right .
but i bet you they're having a bloody pizza somewhere .
d'you want the rest?
go on .
amaze me .
i will .
it's about martin taylor .
come on .
come on !
looks different .
i don't even feel like i've been here before .
liz .
liz .
hey , mikey?
your weed , mate .
you are the cretin .
dude , you're getting laid .
it's gonna be a great time .
yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah !
we weren't locked in from the outside .
shit !
i am in so much trouble !
fuck !
shit , i don't believe it !
the stupid ...
did you try the glass?
what could i do?
i couldn't let him leave .
carry on .
guys , guys !
the water's gone off .
are you sure?
i just went for a drink .
there's no water .
what?
what?
what?
what's happened?
after you start to feel thirsty , ... .. you find yourself feeling impatient .
maybe even a little sick .
then your pulse starts to go up .
then there's the headaches , dizziness ...
when it gets bad , your vision will blur and you'll find it hard to walk and talk .
your tongue swells up .
your skin shrivels .
you twitch .
you go deaf .
and then you die .
how long does this take?
from when we run out of water , about three or four days .
how do you know all this?
army cadets .
liz !
lizzie !
lizzie , it's gonna be fine !
it's gonna be ok , liz !
we're bound to get rescued !
they'll find us .
they will !
next week we'll be down the pub having a laugh .
i promise you .
and i'm buying , all right?
it's gonna be all right .
we'll go out and buy lots of new things .
and there's all those exciting exams to look forward to .
can we look on the positive side?
no , i've got a hard on for those exams .
they're great .
you've got a hard on for everything .
not for you , mate .
i'm ok .
have you ever loved someone so much ... .. you didn't care what happened to yourself?
you just had to be with them .
if they look atyou , ... .. yourheart stops .
ifyou feel theirbreath on yourskin , ... .. youjust ache .
have you ever craved someone so much ... .. that you didn't exist any more?
no .
well , i have .
jezebel )
guys !
hey , guys !
liz !
guys !
liz !
frankie's sick .
look , i'm serious .
she's very , very sick .
it just keeps coming out of her .
so you're fucking her now?
he really doesn't kiss the way i thought he would .
i always thought he'd kiss me really soft , ....
.. but he kisses really hard .
you know , you could have told me about you and mike .
but i suppose it doesn't matter any more .
we're getting on so well !
it's like we've been together for ages .
i think he's falling in love with me .
he is .
yeah , he is , i can feel it .
we'll probably sleep together tonight .
i bet we'll get out tomorrow .
i have a really strong feeling we'll get out .
like ...
iike someone will find us , right?
do you think you can hang on that long?
frankie?
franks?
frankie?

you were my best friend .
what am i going to do?
i'm sorry , frankie ...
frankie ...
don't fucking look at me like that !
i hate it when people look at me like that .
it's not my fault if you don't like what i have to say .
frances was bulimic .
we know that from the lack of enamel on her teeth .
the dramatic bleeding came from a tear in her oesophagus .
she died on the tenth day from heart failure .
carry on .
do you think she'll haunt us?
she'll haunt you .
why me?
why you?
why you? !
you fucking bitch !
because it's your mistake !
your idea , your fault !
you !
does that help at all it's shit in here .
you !
she's sorry ! lsn't it obvious?
she didn't do it on purpose !
just fucking leave it !
you didn't care about fucking frankie !
you're right .
i didn't give a fuck about frankie .
we're just a pair of assholes .
i keep thinking about her mum and her dad ... .. and how they're going to feel when they find out .
i've killed all of you !
i killed ...
no , you didn't .
i did , it's my fault !
i'm sorry !
look , ok?
it's not your fault , ok?
it's not your fault .
i don't know what happened to frankie , but it wasn't you , ok?
really?
really .
ok?
so what we've got to do is try our best to keep strong .
i don't really blame you , liz .
i'm just going nuts .
i keep thinking i can smell the body .
i think i'd rather tear my face off ... .. than smell her rot .
i've got such a terrible headache .
everything's blurry .
i know what that means .
it's all right , geoff .
don't think about it .
take it .
take it .
thank you .
you ok?
i'm sorry ...
mike ...
what are you talking about?
i'm sorry .
you're not well , you should lie down .
i have to tell you something .
lizzie , it's the dehydration .
no .
mike ...
no , mike .
no .
mike , listen .
please stop torturing yourself , ok?
please .
it's not important any more , ok?
it's not your fault .
no , i have to tell you something .
what?
you fucker !
no , mikey !
i was going to share !
no , stop !
geoffrey bingham .
severe head injuries .
this one was murdered .
oh , my god .
look .
we could go together .
fuck , no .
i can't do this any more .
this food will keep us going a little longer .
we could still be found .
we're not going to be found .
they would have found us by now .
look .
mike , it'd be really quick , right?
we'll just fade away and it'll be over ...
you're stronger than that !
we've kept going this long , we can hold out .
please !
it's worth it .
lizzie , i can't do this without you .
you've kept me going .
if you go , i'll have nothing .
i need you .
i love you , liz .
i ...
i love you .
how the fuck did you do that?
the key .
i always had it .
but i couldn't tell you .
how could l?
but it ... it was all for you .
for me?
because i love you .
all this was for you .
for me?
i killed my best friend .
you let me think i was going to die , and you watched me kill my best friend .
i killed him for a fucking coke !
you let frankie die !
you fucking held her hand ... .. and you let her die , you fucking bitch !
fuckin 'whore !
no , mike ...
you fucking bitch !
you don't understand !
i didn't mean ...
mike , no !
what are you doing?
you don't understand !
what are you doing?
stop it !
no , mike !
no !
he was the reason i breathed .
i stayed there , ... .. felt my heart die , ... .. my soul wither .
i wanted to be with him so much ... .. that i couldjust feel myself stepping into the air .
then i thought , at least this way , ... .. he never grows old , he never cheats on me .
he never leaves .
this way hejust ... stays perfect .
you need to say what you've just said to me on tape , ... .. with a solicitor and your parents present .
why?
your statement needs to be official .
i'm not making a statement .
you have to .
that's what the families and everybody the police have been waiting for .
i just told you : they're not going to understand .
look , even you don't understand .
i don't see why i should be punished .
it was an accident !
you're still responsible .
i'm not ruining my life for this !
it's out of your hands .
martin will corroborate what you've told me .
everyone is dead , and you told them that i locked you in !
i was away !
i had no idea you couldn't get out !
it's too late .
no !
philippa !
what the fuck are you doing?
help !
help !
thank god .
thank god .
what's wrong?
help !
help !
it's ok .
i thought she was going to hurt me .
it's over .
we have martin .
you're in deep shit .
you have martin?
yeah .
suicide .
guilty as hell .
