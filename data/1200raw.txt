sometimes , when i'm driving or walking , i see a man in a corner .
he's just standing there , looking .
when he notices he's being observed , he becomes embarrassed .
on bus stops you can also see ordinary people ... just standing there , looking .
what are they thinking about?
what are they looking for?
the past , maybe?
on september 26 , 1998 , i observed one of these men .
but this time it was different .
that man was me .
it was my last moment as someone afraid to commit .
that was when i got rid of the curse and i finally grew up .
in the mid eighties , i shared with my second girlfriend my first flat .
when she asked me ...
do you love me?
i answered ...
i do .
but i wasn't sure .
later , when my future fiance asked ...
where were you on november 9 , 1989?
i answered ...
i was near the berlin wall !
but it wasn't true .
that night , i was in bed with a woman , watching a video .
he feels as if his muscles are relaxed and goes limp again .
sometimes life was nice ; other times , it was shitty .
a pile of shit indeed .
somewhere along the line , i learned how to play .
i learned to fuck , to love and to lie .
it was like that for years .
but now i had turned 30 , and it was time .
either i have this baby or it's over .
you can't be serious .
i am !
i loved her .
i didn't want any other .
i had no reason to run away .
i even wanted to have a child .
why was i running away?
i didn't know why .
but suddenly , i realized that ...
i need to go away for a few days .
where to?
i need to go to berlin .
berlin?
i'd like to know since when you are so afraid of commitment .
helmut , this is serious !
i wish i knew too .
learnlng to lle " i never told this to anybody .
it all began in 1982 .
i was 18, and i saw my father dancing alone in the basement .
where's your father?
he's coming .
helmut !
hi , uncle bertram .
sit down .
i'm worried about you .
about me?
why?
you know the russians are practically on our doorstep .
they're in thuringia , in saxony , right under our noses .
some youths let the russians do whatever they want .
so , have you been to one of these demonstrations?
no .
good !
i hope you stay that way !
what about girlfriends?
have you got any?
no , but i'm trying .
great !
dear students .
the election will be held the following way : ... two committees .
committee a ...
new . ... and b. it's worthless !
the committees will present their platforms .
then the election will be held .
it's a secret ballot .
now that everyone is finally here ... we may begin .
please .
dear fellow students !
modern civilization has the means to destroy itself 100 times .
why doesn't the west take the first step ... towards a world without nuclear weapons ... giving up the pershing ii and cruise missiles?
species diversity is dropping .
acid rain is destroying our forests .
and then there is the so called peaceful use of nuclear power ... but harrisburg was only the beginning .
next time it could happen in biblis or krmmel .
we cannot stick our heads in the sand !
which is , by the way , full of cadmium .
if i win the election , i'll back the formation of groups of students ... to address these problems .
but it's clear that , whatever i do ... the initiative should come from you .
what are these?
they re selections .
this is the first one .
it's called " the trip " .
no , this one !
it's kansas .
dust in the wind " .
exactly . you can take that and go sit among the girls .
isn't that the whole idea?
not yet .
we ain't even out of town .
too soon for that sentimental bullshit .
gotta build up an atmosphere .
i think it's perfect .
you'd play " when i'm 64 " on your grandmother's 64th birthday .
and when we arrive in berlin , i bet you'll play ...
berlin " , by fischer z !
it goes well with the occasion .
that's what music's for !
schfer , you just don't get it !
hi , girls .
hi .
i'd like to congratulate you .
what for?
i voted for you .
you're congratulating me for that?
no .
because you won .
thanks .
my friend would also like to congratulate you .
hi .
hi .
very kind of you to come here to congratulate me .
don't mention it .
that's nice , but we're talking here .
excuse me .
was that great or what?
what's going on between you two?
nothing .
liar .
i saw the way she looked at you .
there's nothing going on .
honest .
we'll reach west berlin soon , right?
come on , guys !
on the bus !
good afternoon .
please let me see your left ear .
see you later .
hey .
hey .
strange sensation , isn't it?
yeah .
hey , guys , listen up .
it's 3 : 15 now .
you may do whatever you want for a while .
i'll see you guys at 6 : 00 at the friedrichstrasse station .
i'm thirsty .
wanna drink something?
hermes , where are you going?
we're gonna drink something .
see you later .
here is fine .
tell me ... after high school , what will you do?
i was thinking of maybe ... joining the peace corps .
i'd like to do something significant .
what about you?
what'll you do?
maybe i'll get into politics .
well ... here it is .
thanks .
1 . 22 , please .
let me pay .
thank you .
sorry , i don't have any change .
well , then ... bring us eight more beers .
i'm paying in advance .
cheers .
when they start doing song requests , it's a bad sign .
lack of sensibility .
a dj's best nights are those without any song requests .
but nobody s dancing .
i won't play commercial songs .
i'll make them dance .
hey , play " words " !
i'll go fetch a beer .
" words don't come easy " .
i haven't got that one .
do you also like berlin?
i like it , of course .
i wish i didn't have to go back .
i think i'll go to college here .
and what will you major in?
medicine .
my brother studied medicine here .
i can't believe they want to listen to this crap !
i wanna live by the wall .
in kreuzberg , somewhere like that .
something simple , in a backyard .
a whole room to myself .
can i have a sip of your beer?
actually , i don't even like beer .
it's very easy to talk to you .
you think so?
excuse me a moment .
hey .
hey .
i had fun this afternoon .
me too .
we should do that again .
days later , helmut kohl was elected chancellor .
for britta , it was a tragedy .
i became a member of the same groups she went to .
the ecological , the anti bomb and the nicaraguan studies groups .
he's the illegitimate son of a wealthy spanish land owner .
and one of the sandino family s employees .
and even though his father was wealthy ...
now you're well acquainted with the material , aren't you?
i am .
would you help me prepare a pamphlet for action week?
of course .
then come to my house tomorrow and we'll begin to prepare it .
you mean ... at your place?
yeah .
i'll write down directions .
it's kinda difficult to find .
how about 4 pm?
hi , are you helmut?
exactly .
i'm jutta , britta's mom .
come in .
hi .
britta is upstairs .
in her " space " .
turn left , it's the shortest way up .
thanks .
hi .
hi .
i've got something for you .
journey to ixtlan " , by castaeda .
you'll like it .
you can keep it .
really?
of course .
when you finish it , tell me what you think .
thanks .
i thought your mom's name was jutta , not brigitte .
brigitte is my dad's ex girlfriend .
my biological father's .
does he live here too?
of course not , silly .
in san francisco .
sit down .
problem is , people think ... that the americans defeated hitler .
didn't they?
they did , but with the help of the red army .
people forget .
besides , as ortega pointed out recently ... the usa were in bed with enemies of democracy several times .
could you pass me that?
of course .
like in nicaragua and with argentinean fascists .
are you listening to me?
yes , i'm listening .
the usa couldn't care less about upholding democratic values .
they spring into action when ... they feel they re losing control .
we need to get back to work .
let's begin again .
we shouldn't go too far on our first time .
besides , i'm having my period .
you're so cute when you blush like that .
i'm cold .
will you keep me warm?
good morning .
what were you thinking?
what do you mean?
good morning .
good morning .
your father talked to you yet?
how could that happen?
what?
me talking to dad?
kid , we were worried sick !
you could have called .
big deal !
i was an hour late !
what if some day i really do something?
will you send me to an orphanage?
don't take that tone with me !
this is no joke .
you know what happened to mrs. heinemann's boy .
he's been unemployed since he was released from jail .
god , mom !
i haven't even finished high school yet !
helmut !
kid ...
i really would like to know what's on your mind .
have you masturbated yet?
this is the first piece of shit i hold today !
what's gotten into you?
nothing .
great day today .
it's a day like any other .
been drinking , by any chance?
nope .
i've got biology .
see you .
hi .
hi .
let's go .
hi .
how are you?
fine .
hi .
hi .
i like it here a lot .
me too .
i'd never been here before .
really?
really .
you're probably wondering why i called you .
it was very nice last night , with you .
last night , you know?
i know .
have you told anyone?
about what?
about last night .
no .
good .
i'd rather you don't , okay?
no , i really liked it .
it's just that , as student body president , i'm under scrutiny .
and i want to keep what we have only between us .
do you understand?
of course .
i don't want anyone talking about us .
and ... if you don't tell anyone ... there's still a lot of things i want to do with you .
agreed?
agreed .
we'd act like strangers at school , then get together in the afternoon .
nobody knew about britta and me .
sometimes , i wanted to tell somebody , but i couldn't .
mcke thought i was acting kinda strange , and he said ...
you're acting kinda strange .
i almost didn't see him anymore .
nobody found out about us .
are you going away for christmas?
no , we always stay here .
i think christmas sucks .
it's not a religious date anymore , just a consumerism festival .
jutta and wilfred always have some friends over ... and we throw a nice party .
you can come too , if you want .
i need to ask my parents .
they certainly won't mind .
merry christmas .
merry christmas .
merry christmas .
merry christmas .
is this fun or what?
i'm gonna have to go out shortly .
what?
i'm gonna have to go out shortly .
what do you mean , you have to go out?
some folks from the student body are giving a party and i want to go .
tonight?
on christmas 'eve?
but we're in the middle of a conversation here .
may i go?
it was very kind of you to ask .
hi .
britta?
you're crazy .
look inside .
to britta , from h.
you're really crazy .
did you like it?
of course i liked it .
are you kidding?
but you shouldn't have done that .
why not?
it must have costed a lot .
money is no problem .
you're so sweet .
i'm going to the us .
i'll go with you .
no , i'm really going ... to live with my dad in san francisco .
i'm leaving next week .
but school starts next week .
exactly .
i'll study there .
what?
for a year .
i'll finish high school there .
i could save up and visit you on easter .
yeah , right .
why not?
listen , a year is a very long time .
you'll probably meet someone .
no .
then maybe i'll meet someone .
do you want to meet another guy?
i didn't say that .
i just said that a year is a very long time .
i think you should go away .
i won't be able to sleep now .
i'll write .
i love you , britta .
see you .
darling britta .
we haven't written to each other in a while , and maybe i changed .
gone is the time when i'd write you five letters a week .
four years later
i stayed in west germany ... and i'm studying german , history and political sciences .
oddly enough , i kinda like it .
i've made some new friends .
one of them is called ...
beck .
i was sad when i knew about your american boyfriend ... because i haven't seen you anymore ... because you stayed there and you never came back to germany .
but i remember your arms and your legs .
i remember your hands and your eyes .
i'll never forget how we slept together ... on christmas night , among books and candles .
helmut?
yes .
helmut hermes .
you haven't changed a bit .
i'd like to see you again .
forever yours , helmut .
i've bumped into gisela schmidtkowsky yesterday .
she didn't go to berlin .
she stayed and went to medical school .
great .
doctors are always needed .
do you keep in touch with anyone from high school?
steffi hanisch is my neighbor .
and i ran into wiebke hellers last week .
that's about it .
i was really sorry about schfer .
i hardly knew him , but you were very close friends , right?
what about schfer?
didn't you know?
i haven't heard from anybody .
not even mcke kuwelko .
i don't even know where that big dope lives !
sorry .
you've got a beautiful laughter .
my god , i've had too much wine !
you're beautiful even without wine .
i only drink a glass once in a while .
you drank from my beer in berlin .
but only because it was yours .
well ... what about schfer?
he died .
what?
he died in a car accident two years ago .
i thought you knew .
i never knew .
shall we ask for our check?
yes , better .
the check , please .
what?
do you hear that?
schfer still rules .
i'll pay .
good evening .
good evening .
hi .
this is rdiger and barbara .
they live here with me .
my name is helmut .
good evening .
do you want a coffee?
good night .
well ... good night , then .
good night .
good night .
good morning , chief .
don't try to socialize .
you've been here for weeks doing nothing .
it's your turn at the sink .
okay .
i need a job .
anything in particular?
whatever .
you got something for me?
we'll see .
i became a parking clerk .
they didn't pay me a lot , but it was easy .
i spent the whole day sitting in the booth , not doing much .
i began to study in earnest out of pure boredom .
with gisela , everything was fine .
i liked to look at her and i liked it when she'd stroke me .
we didn't fight and , most of the time , we had the same opinion .
in bed , she was different from britta .
she didn't mind trying new things ... but she didn't have any ideas of her own .
however , gisela had definite ideas about other things .
i'm looking forward to our first christmas together .
on the 24th , we're gonna visit your parents .
then we'll introduce you to mine and we'll have dinner with them .
on the 25th , we're gonna visit my aunt annie .
she's dying to meet you .
on the 26th , we'll go to the nursing home to see my uncle zikowicz .
he's not my real uncle .
he's a friend of my grandpa's who used to take care of me .
and the afternoon of the 26th is all ours , just to ourselves .
but we're gonna have to prepare some things .
i've invited a few people over for dinner .
you can bring someone too .
maybe that guy beck .
do you guys really skin corpses?
we skin them so we can see the muscles .
each one of us is assigned a different body part .
last time , i got a penis .
must've been interesting .
i'd like to work for the district attorney .
my god .
who are those revolting people?
friends of gisela's .
let's hide in here .
is this gisela's room?
no , this is barbara's .
her roommate .
she's away for christmas .
are you a pervert?
why?
you're going through a stranger's drawers .
not a stranger .
she lives here .
oh , that changes everything .
let's go somewhere else .
we're entertaining .
gisela is entertaining .
two more !
and two beers .
i'll be right back .
tell me , uwe , do you remember that girl?
what girl?
the one who was the student body president .
blonde .
she lived far away , in a farmhouse .
i think her stepfather was a sculptor .
what was her name?
i think it was britta .
yes , britta .
she vanished .
have you got news about her?
no , that's why i'm asking .
last thing i knew , she moved to berlin .
but it was a long time ago .
she was cute .
see?
every christmas , he gets drunk at that table .
15 years ago , he had a great night over there with his first girlfriend .
this place is full of people like him .
but he got it all wrong .
it wasn't about the girl .
what was it about , then?
god .
what?
when he was there with his first girlfriend ... on that christmas , 15 years ago ... he had a divine moment .
they happen .
they don't happen very often , but they happen .
everything was perfect .
it was just his moment .
the girl just happened to be there .
he didn't understand that .
tragic , but men are like that .
it's all about them .
where did we stop?
cheers .
cheers , man .
i heard you come in .
shit .
what's the deal with the panties?
what panties?
you had a pair of barbara's panties wrapped around your penis .
what are you talking about?
excuse me , gotta use the bathroom !
thanks .
good morning .
good morning , barbara .
are you back already?
one day s vacation is enough .
presents , cookies , children with their eyes sparkling .
all that makes me sick .
i'm going downstairs .
have you got laundry?
i do , hang on .
what were you thinking?
i was drunk .
you still working at the theater?
i am .
and what's that like?
okay .
gisela and i soon made up .
but we almost didn't fuck anymore .
sometimes my mom asked me to bring " that nice girlfriend of mine " over .
but i never told that to gisela .
i began to bump into barbara .
barbara !
wanna have a coffee?
i think what you do is really cool .
how would you know?
i imagine it is .
it's a load of shit .
a huge load of shit .
then why do you work there?
that's what i always ask myself .
what's so bad about it?
everything .
the stress , the lies .
it looks interesting to me .
not if you're on the inside .
who's the whiskey for?
for me .
here you go .
i want to sleep with you .
now?
in the weekend , when gisela isn't home .
saturday i'll have time .
in the afternoon .
okay .
the check , please .
yes?
hi .
what is it?
well , are you still up for it?
our fuck .
you said you'd have time today .
now?
yeah .
okay .
whenever gisela wasn't home , barbara and i would have sex .
i can't say i enjoyed it .
it wasn't great , but we didn't care .
that's it .
that's what i liked about it .
now i knew the difference between making love and fucking .
fucking is like a box fight gone out of control .
you bleed .
it's repulsive .
it should be stopped .
but it's exciting .
and totally irrelevant .
this is the 1st german network with the news .
good evening , ladies and gentlemen .
the polls confirmed the coalition government headed by helmut kohl .
after four difficult years ... the constituents renewed our coalition government's mandate .
hi !
helmut , are you there?
helmut?
have you seen helmut ...?
why did you do it?
we'd better split up .
if you think so .
that's all you have to say?
what do you want me to say?
maybe you'd care to explain .
explain what?
how could that happen .
it just happened .
do you love her?
no .
what about me?
i don't know .
nothing else?
is that all?
i don't want you here even for one night more .
i found a little apartment .
i spent a whole year holed up in there , just watching tv .
the diplomatic mission from west germany ... was rushed today by several east berliners ... seeking permission to go to the west side .
they waited in vain .
we're closed right now .
seek information in the media .
east berlin manifested its hope for a stable relationship .
haven't you got any change?
i don't , i'm sorry .
i don't have change for this .
you could say " keep the change " .
should i stay here until i've used up 500 marks ... or shall we have a coffee?
doing nothing .
that's the secret .
that's how you meet the most incredible women .
what do you do for a living?
i'm a sports writer .
cool .
i'm gloria .
tell me about you .
tell you what?
everything .
britta would be impressed seeing me with someone like her .
hello?
helmut !
something awful happened !
what?
what was your uncle like?
he was a smelly , inconvenient bastard .
a hypocritical , oppressive son of a bitch .
but it was your uncle .
great uncle .
still , he was a jerk .
have you ever told him that?
of course not .
that's a shame .
so you're our son's girlfriend .
what's your profession?
i'm a sports writer .
right .
a cognac , please .
yes , ma'am .
are you serious?
i need cognac to get me through funerals .
but it isn't even noon yet !
so what?
double , please .
what exactly does that mean?
what?
excuse me .
how dare she show up dressed like that?
uncle bertram would have approved , the leery bastard .
don't talk about him like that !
don't talk ...
and on his funeral ! ... about my girlfriend like that !
kid , sometimes ...
sometimes you could know what i want for a change , right?
you've changed , son .
i almost don't recognize you .
are you waiting to be interviewed by professor mutter?
what is history?
describing what has really happened .
that's historiography .
at least according to l. von ranke ... whose work you should know by heart .
you , with the skirt , what do you say?
history is ... the facts .
even grammatically that's nonsense .
now you .
history is ... the representation ... no , the course ... ... of past events .
are you serious?
what've you got to say about that?
nothing .
why?
you can't explain in a sentence what others couldn't explain in volumes .
besides , i find theoretical discussions tiresome .
the job is yours .
the others may go .
fascist .
the eighties were coming to an end .
on that autumn , it looked like nothing was ever gonna change .
lift your head up , like that .
you'll feel more free .
as if nothing relevant was ever gonna happen .
what's got into you today?
what do you mean?
you barely have opened your mouth all day .
i'm tired .
i've been real busy this week .
press " pause " .
then my friend mcke called from berlin to say ...
they've opened the border !
what?
and then he went on ...
i saw britta !
i met her at a party last night !
the brandenburg gate , the symbol of berlin's division ...
bad news?
no , why?
you're all white .
they tore down the wall . ...
november 9th ...
so i've heard .
the ddr has declared the border open to anyone .
the gates are open .
more melon?
yes .
helmut , you rascal !
i don't believe it !
come in !
what are you doing here?
tell me about her tits .
tell you what?
she's got two .
but what do they look like?
do they sag to her knees , or what?
she's 41 .
therefore , it's a plausible question .
here you go .
thanks .
bye .
yes?
two kebabs , please .
with sauce?
with everything .
spice them up .
not too spicy for me .
are you gay?
put spice on both , we want everything you've got .
right away .
why have you come to berlin?
the army .
so they wouldn't recruit me .
you?
i've been transferred .
so?
i don't have any idea .
i thought you'd dodge the draft .
why?
you were so bent on all that peace bullshit .
and i thought you were eager to be in the war .
you were wrong .
but a little crossfire could've been fun .
however , obeying orders all the time ...
no , thanks .
why haven't you gone against it?
to clean up weirdo s 'asses isn't exactly my dream .
thanks .
thanks .
and now?
do you work with car sales?
but not the way you're thinking .
i'm a respectable salesman .
in a suit and a tie .
actually , i'm quite good at it .
have you seen britta?
i knew you'd ask about her .
it's not that serious .
you got her phone number?
no .
we just exchanged a few words .
but it shouldn't be difficult to find her .
in a city this size?
no .
i know where she'll be tonight .
well , where she'll probably be .
hi , helmut .
hi , britta .
did you come here by yourself?
no , i'm with mcke .
mcke is here too?
he is .
but i seem to have lost him .
let's go outside for a while .
let's go .
i'm going .
i'm sick and tired of your rude bullshit .
i'm through .
let me go .
was that your boyfriend?
he's an asshole .
what have you been up to , all these years?
i've been to bed early .
and i've been working at college .
for professor mutter .
what about you?
i'm living in berlin .
have you got a job?
of course .
what kind of a job?
why do you want to know all that?
no reason .
do you know of any place where i can sleep tonight?
mcke's gone , and i don't know anyone else here .
get up .
i'll open the wine .
is this your home?
something wrong?
no , i just thought that ...
it's not a farmhouse .
more or less .
i grew tired of those old farmhouses .
i never wanna see another damn farmhouse in my life .
here .
cheers .
welcome to berlin .
it's exciting here , isn't it?
mcke has changed a lot .
i've lost contact with everybody from our old gang .
what about you?
i'm tired .
tomorrow we'll talk more .
okay .
have you still got that ring?
what ring?
the one i gave you for christmas once .
you did?
why didn't you get in touch?
what about you?
you did?
yes .
no .
but i know where she'll be tonight .
you haven't got the hots for her still , have you?
no , i'm fine .
you don't fool me .
she was the love of your life .
and your first fuck .
you don't forget something like that .
i didn't .
how do you know?
she told me .
we had something going at the time too .
britta was a little fox .
god !
what do you mean?
you know i fucked her too , don't you?
what?
you didn't think she was in love with you , did you?
shit , i thought you already knew .
no .
i went straight home and i tried to forget britta .
the nlnetles the nineties came , and she vanished .
i didn't have a lot of girlfriends in the 4 or 5 following years .
i had occasional sex , of course .
sometimes , things even looked promising .
but i got tired of the same old game .
to feign interest , to make clever remarks ... about women's personalities ... to know how to listen , to be charming without being insistent .
to tell the same old jokes about the mess in my apartment .
i couldn't take it anymore .
for me , it was enough .
i wanted someone who was independent , who challenged me ... someone unimpressed by transparent lies .
and then i found her .
where were you on november 9 , 1989?
i was near the berlin wall !
come on , don't lie to me !
tina was the first who made me think about going steady in a long time .
after 2 years , we moved in together .
soon , we began talking about kids .
who got her pregnant this time?
another guy .
that dieter dude .
he went to the movies with us .
the idiot?
yes .
i told her .
he's such a huge bastard .
a phony .
a painter without a shred of artistic value .
can't she see that?
she agreed with you , didn't she?
yes , but she didn't mind .
how could she not mind?
they re not even together .
but what can i say?
she wants to have a kid so much .
what do you think about kids?
i know they exist , and i know how you make them .
can you imagine yourself having your own kids some day?
with you , yes .
must be quite a surprise .
your mother has met someone else .
your father understands that it's all over .
your father will live here for a while .
your mother is going to move .
was this " candid camera "?
when?
tomorrow .
it never went through my head ... that " mother and father " could mean people with a life of their own .
people with their own passions and desires .
what was ever the same was now changed .
that scared me .
things , all of a sudden , seemed serious .
hi !
guess what !
i saved a porcupine .
it was all tangled up in the middle of the road .
i almost couldn't avoid hitting it .
it was so scared .
i wasn't the only one who almost killed it , i bet .
then i stopped .
i took off my jacket , i walked towards it ... and i gently picked it up and put it on the grass .
near the graveyard .
i hadn't seen a porcupine since i was a kid .
what's the matter with you?
my parents are getting a divorce .
what?
it's true .
you gotta decide about our relationship .
either i have this baby or it's over .
you can't be serious .
i am !
i loved her .
i didn't want any other .
i had no reason to run away .
i even wanted to have a child .
why was i running away?
i didn't know why .
but suddenly , i realized that i had a last thing to do .
right away .
hello .
hi , britta .
helmut , it s been ages !
why don't we get together?
how about tomorrow , 9 pm , at the letzten instanz?
i'm sorry , the terrace is closed .
would you like to come in?
what'll it be?
eight beers , please .
all at once?
if possible .
well ...
your eight beers .
enjoy .
thanks .
you've reached britta prinz .
leave your ...
thanks .
excuse me , sir .
can you take a picture of us?
you haven't changed a bit .
i've already ordered .
i'm sorry i'm so late .
if i had your number , i would have called you .
i left my cell phone at home .
right .
it was stupid of me , but it's nice not being bothered for a whole day .
and we did just fine without it , right?
that's true .
white wine , dry .
okay .
well , so?
are you married?
any kids?
me?
no , i ...
but you've got a girlfriend , right?
no .
yes .
i mean ... ... i m not sure .
seems complicated .
well , it is .
what's the matter?
you don't love her anymore?
i do !
that's not it .
i think i'm the problem .
why?
i was an asshole .
so she doesn't love you anymore .
you think so?
i don't know her , but an asshole is not what women look for .
do i know her?
i don't think so .
tina kallmann?
she's a tax consultant .
self employed .
doesn't sound very exciting .
but actually ... actually , she's very ...
exciting .
yes .
among other things .
sometimes she looks down as if she was saying ...
i know how you feel .
i felt lost too , here .
or when i say something stupid , she doesn't frown , she indulges me .
she's got a beautiful laughter .
she's not particularly different , but ... sincere .
she's not fake .
i think that's it , she's not fake .
and i screwed it all up .
what did you do?
i ran away and i came here .
i thought i needed to see you again .
and then you came through that door ... and i looked at you , and ... well ...
you're just like any other person .
excuse me .
it was nice seeing you .
can you pay that for me?
tina?
tina , i had to tell you the whole story .
in that moment , all of a sudden , everything became clear .
i didn't have any doubts , there was only you .
i know i've screwed up .
but i want this chance ... because of one thing ...
i am certain .
i love you , tina .
you are really something , helmut .
the end
