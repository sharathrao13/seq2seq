hey ...
honey ...
morgan?
what's happening?
the dogs wer e barking woke us up .
ar e you hurt?
i think god did it .
did what , morgan?
look , lee , i don't even car e if it was him .
and you can just have a word with him , and that'd be enough f or me .
see , it was strange finding the crops that way .
the kids wer e conf used by it , and , uh , it'd sur e take the strangeness away if i knew it was just lionel and the wolfington brothers messing around , that's all .
at the movies?
ar e you sur e?
alright , then .
uh , thanks f or your patience , lee .
yeah .
bye .
houdini peed .
i think he's sick .
why don't you take him outside?
i'll call dr. crawf ord .
he doesn't tr eat animals .
well , he'll know what to do .
oh .
that was quick , caroline .
i only called you f olks two hours ago .
old mrs. kendleman twisted her ankle , as she puts it , diving f or her lif e when a bunch of school kids rode down the sidewalk on skateboards .
she went down to thornton's stor e this morning and started spitting on the new skateboards .
spitting !
by the time i got ther e ,
mrs. kendleman had sprayed the whole damned place .
and she must have had a cold or something .
i'm telling you , i won't eat f or a week .
so , what happened to your crops?
dad's gonna burn these again .
it's contaminated .
you don't even know what that word means .
it's not contaminated .
it's just tap water .
pour it in his bowl .
it tastes f unny .
it does not .
and besides , he licks his butt every day .
i don't think he'll mind .
houdini?
bo , don't run .
what's wrong , boy?
stop it , houdini .
look at wher e it's bent over , father .
it's not broken .
now , what kind of machine can bend a stalk of corn over without br eaking it?
can't be by hand .
it's too perf ect .
it doesn't sound much like lionel prichard and the wolfington brothers .
they can't take a piss without wetting the f ront of their pants .
i don't think anyone else around her e has had any problems .
i was over at theo henry's f arm yesterday afternoon , and he would have mentioned something .
why wer e you at theo's place?
some animals around the county have been acting f unny and some of them violent .
what is it , a virus?
i don't think so , father .
they'r e mor e edgy , you know , and alert .
it's almost like they act when they smell a pr edator around peeing on themselves and everything .
caroline ... please stop calling me " father .
what's wrong?
i don't hear my childr en .
he f ell on me .
he wanted to kill bo .
did he hurt you?
no .
i'm so sorry , morgan .
wher e wer e you?
houdini's sick .
tie isabel up to the back of the shed , please , and make sur e the knot's very tight .
what's the matter?
ther e's a monster outside my room .
can i have a glass of water?
what's wrong with the water next to your bed?
it tastes old .
what ar e you thinking about?
why do you talk to mom when you'r e by yourself?
makes me f eel better .
does she ever answer back?
no .
she never answers me either .
what?
lionel prichard and the wolfington brothers ar e back .
it's time f or an arse whupping .
this is not an intelligent way to approach this .
lee is a f riend of mine .
this is his son .
yeah , we'll be doing lee a f avour .
alright , listen we both go outside , move around the house in opposite dir ections .
we act crazy , insane with anger make them crap in their pants , f orce them around till we meet up on the other side .
explain " act crazy .
you know , curse and stuff .
you want me to curse?
you don't mean it .
it's just f or show .
what?
well , it won't be convincing .
it doesn't sound natural when i curse .
just make noises , then .
explain " noises .
ar e you gonna do this or what?
no , i'm not .
alright , you want them stealing something in the house next time?
on the count of thr ee
1 ...
alright .
2 ... 3 !
aaah !
i'm insane with anger !
we'r e gonna beat your arse , bitch !
we'r e gonna tear your head off !
i'm losing my mind !
it's time f or an arse whupping !
i cursed .
i heard .
how did he get ...
ar e you sur e this is lionel prichard?
you like that?
you got an old baby monitor around?
bo had an old baby monitor .
you can use bo's baby monitor as a walkie talkie .
you can?
mm hmm .
it only works one way , but that'll do fine .
that is , until someone gets you an old walkie talkie left over at the station .
stop !
it's hideous !
get it off !
l i know what to do .
hey , bo ... turn that down till officer paski leaves .
doy da !
you'r e too old to still be doing this .
you take a glass of water , and you finish it .
now , what's wrong with this one?
it has dust in it .
this one?
a hair .
this one?
morgan took a sip , and it has his amoebas in it .
my turn .
so , how ar e you , merrill?
fine .
how is work at the gas station?
stimulating .
i never got a chance to tell you , but l i thought your moving in her e with your brother after it was a nice thing to do .
well , i don't think i'm helping much .
you ar e .
sorry .
okay , so f ar i have , " it was very dark .
yes , it was .
you can't describe him at all?
don't you think that's kind of odd?
a little .
i don't know whether to look f or a giant or a midget .
no , he definitely wasn't a midget .
okay .
so he was tall?
l i would say so , yes .
probably .
over 6 f eet?
it was very dark .
yes , it was .
how certain ar e you that this was a male?
oh , i don't know i don't know any girls who could run like that .
i don't know , merrill .
i've seen some of those women on the olympics .
they can run like the wind .
this guy got on our roof in , like , a second .
o our roof is 10 f eet high .
they have women's high jumping in the olympics .
they got these scandinavian women who can jump clean over me .
caroline , i know you'r e making a point her e , but i just don't know what it is .
an out of town woman stopped by the diner yesterday afternoon and started yelling and cussing because they didn't have her f avourite cigar ettes at the vending machine .
she scar ed a couple of the customers .
no one's seen her since .
and my point is , we don't know anything about the person you saw , and we should just keep all possibilities available .
dad , wher e's the r emote?
i don't know , baby .
why don't you check in the sof a cushions?
ex cluding the possibility that a f emale scandinavian olympian was running around outside our house last night , what else might be a possibility?
i'm not done asking questions , and i don't appr eciate sarcasm .
do you two have anyone who might have a grudge or something against you maybe a a church member who who might not have liked the f act that you left the church?
i don't think so .
okay , i was out of line with the whole f emale scandinavian olympian thing .
it's just , i'm pr etty strong , and i'm pr etty f ast .
and i was running as f ast as i could , and this guy , he was he was just toying with us .
ther e's only f ood under the sof a .
baby , why don't you just change the channel on the television?
i did .
and?
same show's on every station .
every station?
bo , turn up the volume .
crop signs first emerged in the late '70s with r enewed inter est in extraterr estrial lif e .
they died out by the early '80s , dismissed as hoax es .
this new r esurgence is wholly diff er ent .
the speed and the quantity in which it has appear ed implies the coordination of hundr eds of individuals over many countries .
ther e ar e only a limited number of explanations .
either this is one of the most elaborate hoax es ever cr eated , or basically ... it's f or r eal .
extraterr estrials .
what in god's name is going on?
i did some r esearch after i saw your crops .
two or thr ee guys can make a design the size of the one in your field overnight using just boards and ropes .
really?
that's how these things have been done in the past .
but ther e ar e so many now .
how could so many people be in on it?
i can't think straight .
i'm i'm gonna go back to the station and have a cup of edgar's coff ee and and try to think clear .
and after that , i'll ...
i might make some calls .
but i'll tell you something what i said in ther e , it still goes .
your your f amily has been through a lot .
and the last thing these childr en need to do is worry about some crazy things happening in the world .
now , take them into town and get their minds and your mind on everyday things , hmm?
good medicine .
that's good advice .
and you take car e of yourself ...
graham .
the f ootage you'r e watching was shot yesterday afternoon by a 34 year old local cameraman in bangalor e , a southern city of india .
it's the 18th r eported crop sign f ound in that country in the last 72 hours .
uncle merrill , will you turn on the radio?
they ar e signs intended to be seen f rom the sky
no radio either .
just f or a while .
book money?
sur e .
just one .
be back f or pizza in 15 .
it's just a bunch of crock .
they'r e trying to sell sodas .
it's plain and simple .
been watching these r eports since morning .
i have seen 12 soda commercials so f ar 12 !
you have any books on extraterr estrials?
now , don't tell me you believe this horse manur e .
as a matter of f act , i think we have one .
came by mistake in a shipment decided to keep it f or the city people .
last row , third book on the left , honey .
why is no one saying the obvious?
these ar e just copycats .
someone somewher e does the first one ...
it was asthma medicine , right , father?
for morgan hess .
and it's not " father " anymor e .
in less than an hour , a couple hundr ed people get the same brilliant idea , and her e we ar e , on the verge of mass hysteria .
can i ask you a f avour , father?
i need to clear my conscience .
will you listen to me?
tracey ... i am not a r ever end anymor e .
i haven't been f or six months .
you know this .
all this stuff on tv two girls came in her e talking about the end of the world
i'm just a little scar ed .
please , i need to clear my conscience .
i've got it figur ed .
you do?
i've had two separate f olks tell me ther e have been strangers around these parts last couple nights .
can't tell what they look like
'cause they'r e staying in the shadows covertlike .
nobody's been hurt , mind you .
and that's the giveaway .
i see .
it's called " probing .
it's a military procedur e .
you send out a r econnaissance group very small to check things out .
not to engage but to evaluate the situation evaluate the level of danger , make sur e things ar e all clear .
clear f or what?
for the r est of them .
yeah?
you got a pamphlet or something i can r ead?
sur e .
thanks .
you didn't used to play baseball , did ya?
shit , i know you .
you'r e merrill hess .
i was ther e the day you hit that 507 f ooter over the left field wall set the r ecord .
man , that thing had a motor on it .
it's still the r ecord , right?
got the bat at home o on the wall .
you've got two minor league home run r ecords , don't ya?
five .
why wer en't you in the pros making stacks of cash and getting your toes licked by beautif ul women?
'cause he has another r ecord most people don't know about .
he has the minor league strikeout r ecord .
hello , lionel .
merrill's a class a scr ew up .
he would just swing that bat as hard as he could every time .
didn't matter what the coaches said , didn't matter who was on base .
he would just whip that bat through the air as hard as he could .
looked like a lumberjack chopping down a tr ee .
merrill her e has mor e strikeouts than any two players .
you r eally got the strikeout r ecord?
felt wrong not to swing .
it's contaminated .
carl , ther e's something wrong with our water .
your water's fine .
bo has this thing about her drinking water .
she had it her whole lif e .
it's like a tick people have , ex cept it's not a tick .
is that right?
13 !
don't give me that so so soda
that same old cola
i wanna pop
pop , pop i wanna ... shasta i'll take it .
i cursed 37 times last week .
i said the " f " word a couple times , but mostly ... " shits " and ... " bastards .
is " douche bag " a curse?
i suppose that would depend on its usage .
how about , " john , you'r e a douche bag f or kissing barbara "?
it's a curse .
then it's not 37 .
it's 7 1 .
pharmacy crowded?
i don't want any one of you spending time with tracey abernathy alone .
is that understood?
is that him?
yeah .
who is he?
what is it?
it's bo's baby monitor .
i f ound it in the basement .
i'm gonna use it as a walkie talkie .
what if it's catching a signal f rom them?
it's not .
but it wasn't working .
morgan , this crop stuff is about a bunch of nerds who never had a girlf riend in their lives .
they'r e , like , 30 , and they work up little codes together , and they analyse gr eek mythology and make up secr et societies wher e other guys who never had girlf riends bef or e can join in .
they do stupid crap like this to f eel special .
it's a scam .
nerds wer e doing it 25 years ago , and new nerds ar e doing it again .
it's just static , morgan , alright .
turn it up .
see .
it's a code .
why can't they get girlf riends?
can i see that , please?
it's noise .
it's broken , morgan .
it's just gonna keep doing this .
maybe some new batteries ...
we might lose the signal .
this is exactly what the nerds want .
i'm getting out now .
nobody move .
voices .
did you hear that?
not english , though .
you heard the voices , right , uncle merrill?
i heard them , morgan .
probably picking up another baby monitor .
that's right .
let me see it .
stop !
see , this is why we'r e not watching tv .
people get obsessed .
i'm letting go now .
no , dad !
don't do it !
you'll lose the signal .
don't let go .
it gets clear er the higher you hold it .
i got it .
bo , honey , i don't want you climbing on the car .
come her e .
stop !
ther e's two of them talking .
isabel , you'r e gonna f eel very silly when this turns out to be all just make believe .
you'r e wasting your time her e !
i'm not gonna r eport this or anything you do to my crops to the news or tv or anybody !
you'r e not going to get f amous !
okay .
let's turn on the tv .
it first appear ed 52 minutes ago .
mexico city officials as well as u. s. officials have confirmed that these ar e not aircraft f rom either government's air f orce .
the first sighting was made by an air mexico 7 47 en route f rom mazatln to new york as the unidentified crafts enter ed mexico city air space .
they wer e not detected by radar by either country .
the nerds wer e right .
we have to tape this .
my ballet r ecital .
listen , bo , this is very important .
everything people have written about in science books is going to change .
the history of the world's f utur e is on the tv right now .
we need to r ecord this so you can show your childr en this tape and say you wer e ther e .
for your childr en , bo .
my ballet r ecital .
dad !
find another tape .
uncle merrill , i'm using your tape .
you ar e seeing a live f eed f rom our affiliate down her e in mexico city .
this image has not been adjusted or enhanced in any way .
what you'r e seeing is r eal .
it's unbelievable .
everything they wrote in science books is about to change .
i told you .
some people ar e probably thinking this is the end of the world .
that's true .
do you think it could be?
yes .
how can you say that?
that wasn't the answer you wanted?
couldn't you pr etend to be like you used to be?
give me some comf ort .
people br eak down into two groups when they experience something lucky .
group number one sees it as mor e than luck , mor e than coincidence .
they see it as a sign evidence that ther e is someone up ther e watching out f or them .
group number two sees it as just pur e luck , a happy turn of chance .
i'm sur e the people in group number two ar e looking at those 14 lights in a very suspicious way .
for them , the situation isn't 50 50 .
could be bad , could be good .
but deep down , they f eel that whatever happens , they'r e on their own .
and that fills them with f ear .
yeah , ther e ar e those people .
but ther e's a whole lot of people in the group number one .
when they see those 14 lights , they'r e looking at a miracle .
and deep down , they f eel that whatever's going to happen , ther e'll be someone ther e to help them .
and that fills them with hope .
see , what you have to ask yourself is , what kind of person ar e you?
ar e you the kind who sees signs , sees miracles?
or do you believe that people just get lucky?
or look at the question this way is it possible that ther e ar e no coincidences?
i was at this party once .
i'm on the couch with randa mckinney .
she was just sitting ther e
looking beautif ul , staring at me .
i go to lean in and kiss her ... and i r ealise i have gum in my mouth .
so i turn , take out the gum , stuff it in a paper cup next to the sof a , and turn around .
randa mckinney throws up all over herself .
i knew the second it happened it was a miracle .
i could have been kissing her when she thr ew up .
that would have scarr ed me f or lif e .
i may never have r ecover ed .
i'm a miracle man .
those lights ar e a miracle .
ther e you go .
so , which type ar e you?
do you f eel comf orted?
yeah , i do .
then what does it matter?
i never told you the last words that colleen said bef or e they let her die .
she said , " see .
then her eyes glazed a bit .
and then she said , " swing away .
you know why she said that?
because the nerve endings in her brain wer e firing as she died , and some random memory of us at one of your baseball games just popped into her head .
ther e is no one watching out f or us , merrill .
we ar e all on our own .
what do you know?
well , ther e was an accident drunk driving , they wer en't sur e
he wasn't drunk .
ray f ell asleep at the wheel .
is he okay?
yeah .
that was the first thing colleen asked , too .
she's talking .
what ambulance is she in?
she's not in an ambulance , father .
for the kids 'protection .
all they wer e doing was watching tv f rom 5 . 00 a . m .
i f elt like they wer e getting obsessed , like you said .
they should be playing f urry , f urry rabbit or tea party or something .
what's f urry , f urry rabbit?
it's a game , isn't it?
anyways , they closed the schools .
and ther e's been some inter esting developments .
what time is it?
11 . 00 a . m .
they'r e gone , but they'r e not r eally gone .
we just can't see them .
early this morning , a bird flew into the ar ea wher e the lights wer e hovering last night .
it stopped dead in the air and f ell straight down .
they caught it on tape .
they've been playing it all morning .
the f ootage looks like the bird flew into a wall in the sky .
they f ound the bird .
his his head was crushed in .
they think they have some kind of invisible shield thing going , l like an optical illusion .
they'r e still ther e , hovering .
some people think ther e's mor e of them now ... all over the place , over us , even .
ther e's a theory about the c the crop circles .
they could be some kind of some kind of landmark , visual mapping system so they could navigate , coordinate makes sense .
want to hear a story?
is it true?
so the aliens can't r ead our minds .
oh .
oh , of course .
they tell you everything in this book .
it says they'r e probably very small , like my height , because as their brains develop , ther e was no use f or physical development .
it also says they'r e probably vegetarians because they would have r ealised the benefits of such a diet .
who wrote this book?
scientists who have been persecuted f or their belief s .
that means they'r e unemployed .
if you'r e gonna make f un of it , then f orget it .
this is serious .
i don't know what got into me .
ther e ar e pictur es .
dr. bimbu , one of the authors of the book
bimbu?
dad .
i just asked his name .
you had a tone .
he said ther e ar e two r easons why extraterr estrials would visit us to make contact in the spirit of exploration and f urthering the knowledge of the universe , or the other r eason they'r e hostile .
they've used up all the r esources on their planet , and they'r e looking to harvest our planet next .
her e .
looks a little like our house , doesn't it?
same windows .
that's weird .
yeah , oh , yeah .
that's enough f rom dr. bimbu f or now .
everybody in this house needs to calm down and eat some f ruit or something .
hello?
father?
hello?
hello? !
i'm going out f or a f ew minutes .
no one leaves this house no one .
wher e you going?
ray reddy's house .
why?
i think he just called her e .
you don't think something bad will happen , do you , morgan?
why?
you have one of your f eelings again?
is it bad?
i won't let anything bad happen to you .
i don't want you to die .
who said i was gonna die?
who said i was gonna die?
hello , ray .
what happened?
i wrote your number down to call you .
it's been sitting next to the phone f or 6 months .
when i knew it was inside the house ...
i couldn't think of any other number to call .
i panicked .
thank you f or coming , father .
you'r e welcome , ray .
i worked so long that night .
i've never f allen asleep driving bef or e ... never since .
don't .
most of the ride home , ther e wasn't a car in sight in either dir ection .
if i'd have f allen asleep then ,
i would have ended up in a ditch with a headache .
and it had to be at that right moment that 10 , 15 seconds when i passed her walking .
it was like it was meant to be .
i guess if this is the end of the world ,
i'm scr ewed , right?
people who kill r ever ends 'wives ar en't exactly usher ed to the f ront of the line in heaven .
wh wher e ar e you going , ray?
to the lake .
the way i see it ... these places marked in crops and such none of them ar e r eally near water .
i don't think they like water .
can't be any worse than her e .
did you see something , ray?
i know what i've done to you .
i made you question your f aith .
i'm truly sorry f or what i've done to you and yours .
alright .
and don't open my pantry , father .
i f ound one of them in ther e and locked him in .
the startling f ootage we'r e about to show you was photographed by a 42 year old , romero valadar ez .
this video was taken yesterday afternoon at his son's 7th birthday in the city of passo fundo , brazil .
it was sent to the local news bur eau ther e and sent to us via satellite just a f ew minutes ago .
all initial opinions ar e this is genuine .
what you'r e about to see may disturb you .
move , childr en !
vmanos !
oh !
hello?
the police ar e her e .
i am with them .
i am a police officer .
i just want to talk with you .
we know all about the hoax .
we alr eady took some of your f riends downtown in a paddy waggon .
just tell us your name and why you did it , and we'll give you the same deal we gave the others .
don't throw your lif e away , son .
oh !
ah !
oh !
their skin changes colours .
that's why we couldn't see them that night .
tell me something , morgan .
uh ... in this book of yours ... did they happen to detail what would happen if they wer e hostile?
yes .
it said they would probably invade .
they would use ground tactics hand to hand combat .
they wouldn't use our technology or fight an airborne battle
'cause they know eventually we would use nuclear weapons .
then the planet would be useless to them .
how could anyone possibly know that inf ormation?
it's ridiculous .
what else did it say?
they said ther e ar e one of two outcomes of an invasion .
one , they fight and ar e def eated and have to r eturn again with f ull f orces hundr eds , maybe even thousands , of years later .
what's two?
they win .
i'm sorry , what what book is this?
is this r eally happening?
i heard a theory that , uh , they don't like places near water .
maybe we'd be saf e f rom them near a lake or something .
sounds made up .
i saw one of them at ray reddy's house .
i can't be sur e , but i got the distinct f eeling he wanted to harm me .
so ... we can choose to believe this lake idea , pack up , and go , or we can stay her e , hide inside our home , wait it out .
we might be overr eacting , but i'm willing to live with that .
either way , at least we'll be together .
all those in f avour of the lake idea , raise your hand .
yeah .
all those in f avour of home , raise your hand .
okay .
my vote counts as two .
that's bullshit !
you'r e cheating !
morgan , calm down .
i get two votes because i r epr esent two par ents her e .
we don't know anything yet .
we'll be saf e her e anyway .
i don't want to leave home .
this is wher e we lived with mom .
that's got nothing to do with this .
i change my vote .
you can't change your vote .
all those in f avour of home , raise your hand .
this is ridiculous .
you lose , 3 2 .
we'r e going to board up every window in this house .
how do we know boards will do anything?
because they seem to have trouble with pantry doors .
the inf ormation we'r e r eceiving comes f rom our affiliates across the world .
dad , uncle merrill !
amman joins nairobi , beijing , and jerusalem as the latest to confirm the appearance of lights .
ther e ar e lights in over 27 4 cities .
they think it'll be 400 within the hour .
they'r e appearing at or within one mile of crop signs .
they were f or navigation .
they made a map .
they'r e gonna be within a mile of us .
dad?
yes?
they think these ar e staged immediately pr eceding an attack manoeuvr e .
i was wrong .
they'r e hostile .
it's like " war of the worlds .
ground f orces have been assembled in countries throughout the globe .
hundr eds of thousands have flocked to temples , synagogues , and churches .
god be with us all .
i'm going to get back to the windows .
hey , you guys okay?
some guy had a sign saying it was the end of the world .
don't worry .
you won't let anything happen to us , right?
no way .

they'r e on the roof .
while they wer e fixing her up , all she kept asking about was you .
they'r e in the house .
i wanted your mama to see you first because she had dr eamt about you her whole lif e .
then she got f eeling better , they brought you in , and they placed you in her arms , and she looked at you , and you looked at her , and you just star ed at each other f or the longest time .

what does that mean pinned?
the truck the truck has sever ed most of her lower half .

she won't be saved .
her body is pinned in such a way that it's alive when it shouldn't be alive , and the truck is holding her together .
and she doesn't f eel much , and she's she's talking almost like normal , and we didn't pull the truck out
'cause we we wanted you to come down her e and be with her as long as she's awake .
and that won't be very long .
now , father , do you understand what i've told you?
caroline ... is this the last time i'm gonna talk with my wif e?

a lot of people died .
but they'r e leaving .
they left r eal f ast this morning ,
like something scar ed them off .
they left some of their wounded behind .
why ar e they going?
people must have figur ed out a way to beat them .
everyone has a weakness , right?
you didn't think we'd make it through the night , did you?
no .
listen ... ther e's things i can take and a couple things i can't .
one of them i can't take is when my older brother , who's everything i want to be ... starts losing f aith in things .
i saw your eyes last night .
i don't want to ever see your eyes like that again .
okay?
i'm serious .
okay .
he's been like that f or a while .
he needs his medicine .
have they said anything about our ar ea?
