that was unreal .
yeah , it was nice .
nice?
but you were calling out my name .
you were banging my head into the headboard and singing .
it hurt .
why didn't you say something?
i just wanted you to finish .
oh , this isn't right !
well , did you at least ... you know ...?
no , freddy , i didn't come .
look , don't worry about it , ok?
oh , for christ's sake !
pay attention !
you might learn something .
i hated music at first .
seriously .
no !
i don't want to !
but my parents were determined .
i mean , they really tried , man .
no , no , no , stop !
how many times ...?
after the banjo , the trumpet , the piccolo and the accordion , guess what came next .
go on , guess .
summer of '85 .
first time i'd been in a record shop .
i was with my date .
ok , baby sitter .
that was the moment the lights just blazed on .
that was the day i knew i was destined to be a rock star .
unfortunately , i was a generation late .
by the time i was ready , live music in sydney was flatlining .
pokies .
why people sat there fitting their week's wages down a slot was anyone's guess .
profits ruled .
live music just couldn't compete .
it was now up to the labels to make sure we had cutting edge artistes to choose from .
i've been waiting for this .
her last album was great .
have you heard " scent of my love "?
i love that song .
i had a band .
we rocked hard .
well , we would've .
after a year of rehearsing , all we needed was a gig , but that was proving pretty tough .
then one day , just like on an mtv special ...
shaw's records .
freddy , it's bruno .
bruno , how are you?
gig?
yeah , right , mate .
it's not my birthday .
no bullshit .
it's for real .
you serious?
yeah .
yeah !
bruno , you rock !
the guys are gonna be stoked !
one phone call .
one gig .
it can change your whole life .
destiny , man .
oi !
you !
we should open with that song , definitely .
no , it's a better closer .
hook 'em with the ballad , then jerk off with the arty shit .
it's not arty shit , bruno .
it's just an expression , you big ...
guys !
guys !
take it easy .
we've finally got a gig , right?
oh , jesus , a gig .
my hands are shaking .
ah .
flop sweat .
a little something to soothe those nerves?
mm , let me think .
and how do they rate next to rat poison?
i give them a 6 . 8 on the luce o meter .
a nice , level high .
oh , really?
brunes , you did the gig guide , right?
does the queen wipe her own arse?
everyone and their dog's gonna be there tomorrow night .
relax .
when i'm finished , you'll be headlining homebake !
all right !
let's do it again .
count us in , luce .
one , two , three , four !
not again !
fuck .
bruno's onto it .
oi !
grandpa !
you do that one more time , i'll plug in your walker , and a thousand volts will sizzle the scraggly white hairs on your balls !
dickhead .
good one , brunes .
are ... you ... ready?
dad .
yeah .
that was pretty bloody pathetic .
are ... you ... ready?
yeah !
dad , please .
suck more piss !
all right !
first gig !
i remember our first gig with the boomawangs , back in seventy ...
six .
'76 .
the singer got hit with a beer bottle .
a chunk of glass went right in his eyeball .
and he kept ...
kept on singing .
kate !
katie !
got my eye on you , baby !
isn't that how you got the pirate thing?
yeah , yeah .
career maker that bastard was .
found this in the second hand bin .
klss and make up .
gee , thanks , kate .
so , are you guys psyched or what?
yeah !
oh , my god !
aren't you , like , with that band?
you must have me confused with someone else .
bruno !
you pig .
that's heavy .
i wouldn't .
yeah?
i could bench press your arse no strain , drummer boy .
hey , that killer opener you're having trouble with?
i've some ideas for the lyric .
who's a pig now , eh?
oh , brunes !
wait , wait .
don't say anything yet .
anything to say to people watching at home?
i am luscious lucy .
let the snare bite and the high hat hiss , for i am the best drummer in the world !
you're not , luce .
so tan , how we feelin '?
i think i'm gonna be sick .
all right .
all right .
freddy .
yo .
how are those vocal chords , man?
strong , smooth and ready to rumble !
so , you're feelin 'pretty good then?
yeah .
it's what it's all about , man .
we're gonna remember this night for ever .
all right .
we're gonna take a break , so nobody leave .
tan , you're pushin 'too hard .
you're anticipating the crash .
what i'm anticipating is my bass wrapped round your head .
what?
as manager of a band who are supposed to play tonight , i'm entitled to free drinks !
mate , your band's name ain't on my list .
in a pinch management?
freddy , where the hell are you?
i'm at the duke of york .
where the hell do you think i am?
the duke of clarence?
i'm fucking positive it was the duke of york .
it was the clarence , you fucking idiot !
i'm goin 'into a tunnel .
hey , brune .
when do we start?
that idiot is sacked .
we were just managed up shit creek .
let's go to a real pub , yeah?
yeah .
coming , aren't you?
i'm not really up for it .
joe !
jesus , one drink .
you haven't talked to me all night .
i'll catch you later , ok?
four schooners , thanks , thommo .
freddy .
how's life?
don't ask .
actually , i'll tell you how life is , thommo .
pretty shitty , mate .
here we are , musicians with somethin 'to say and no place to say it .
why? " , you ask .
because certain publicans i know are employing pricks like him instead of real musicians like us .
all just to save a quick buck .
you make me feel like such an enemy of art .
yeah .
well , when you're ready to book a real band , let me know .
man , we could rock the tits off this place .
sure thing .
next slot that opens up , you'll be the fourth or fifth out of work band i call .
promise .
hang in there with your music , champ .
before a feast , there must be famine .
mate , your wallet !
feast !
it's such a sexual game .
balls , stick ...
choice of holes .
you lubricate ...
then choose your position .
were you breast fed?
oh , yeah .
cos studies link sexual obsession and the lack of mummy's tit .
too soft , humiliation .
too hard ...
well .
you can never be too hard .
beer?
certainly .
what did you think?
honestly .
i thought it was going really well till the guy turned the greyhound races up .
at least his dog lost .
i don't know , katie .
it's all i've ever wanted , you know?
just to be up on stage and have everyone loving my music as much as i do .
maybe it's just a stupid dream .
yeah , i guess .
what?
it's only stupid if you give it up .
yeah , well , i won't be doin 'that in a hurry .
you don't think joe's got someone else , do you?
he'd have to be insane .
you know what he's like .
yeah , i suppose .
c'mon , tan , let's jam .
no , not till i beat this depraved bastard .
catch you later .
see you .
joe , you fill me so perfectly .
it's like someone's poured plaster inside me , pulled it out , and stuck that exact mould right on your balls .
you smell great , angie .
i like it here .
so dark .
so still , joe .
joe?
you ever think about suicide?
oh , angie ...
then my parents walk in .
what did you do?
handed the joint to kev and told them it was his idea .
that's when we started rehearsing in the penthouse .
thanks for the lift .
no worries .
hold on a sec .
it does that .
so , you mentioned some lyrics?
yeah .
i don't know if they're what you're looking for , it's just a few ideas i had over coffee .
wow , this is unreal !
wait , what's that word?
people "?
" pimple .
pimple !
that's even better !
katie , this is poetry , man .
you think so?
yeah !
fucking kate !
what?
i said " fucking great !
maybe they forgot to mention it .
i heard it on the radio myself .
the gig guide .
they gave our number and said we need a manager .
face it , mate , no one wants to manage us .
it was only an hour ago .
take it easy .
hello?
yes , we are still looking for a manager , actually .
yeah , we could hang around .
are you far?
no .
pretty friggin 'close .
bruno , listen ...
i'm mindin 'my own biz on the crapper , givin 'birth to a bruno loaf , when i hear this bullshit on the radio .
my arsehole snaps shut like a mousetrap .
you messed up the gig .
one little mistake .
fuck you very much .
you've never made a mistake , you little fairy?
guys .
no .
give me another chance .
just one more chance !
no .
i ...
i'm the manager .
don't crush my dreams .
i'd rather be dead !
do something , freddy .
what?
i don't have a gun .
c'mon , freddy .
do somethin '.
what?
make him our roadie?
roadie?
joe , we've been mates since the squid days .
you know i'd never tread on your turf .
it's just , you and katie .
i mean ...
things just don't seem to be goin 'that well , and i just figured that if ... you know , if i ... ... the australian rock awards , sprimp's debut album shot to platinum in four weeks flat , under the guidance of manager of the year , shad kern .
however , the band had ...
holy shit !
kern management , please hold .
yes?
i'm here to see shad kern .
do you have an appointment?
no , but i have his wallet .
no way !
no fucking way does sprimp do support for anybody .
i don't care if they're rock icons .
icons !
we've got five sold out entertainment centres .
if we wanna do the stadium , we'll do it ourselves .
fuck them !
hey , fuck 'em !
fuck 'em !
fuck 'em !
fuck 'em !
shad !
how you goin '?
who is this?
it's freddy .
we met the other night at the palace hotel .
right .
the dj hater .
yeah !
hey , you left this .
dig your work , man .
cheers , brother .
thanks .
i don't know what i was thinking .
oh , i do .

i know it .
incredible .

toby .
toby !

yeah , man in four hours .
the traffic's been atrocious .

i don't know what i'd do without you , man .
they're only after us , you see ...
see you later .
bye , shad .
you .
with me .
we've been rehearsing for about a year and we've got a killer sound .
it's just so edge of your seat , you know , " give me more , you bastards .
yeah , yeah .
listen .
about the redhead?
thanks .
you know the best thing about this industry?
well , people call it an industry , but i prefer the term " playpen .
the best thing about this playpen is the drugs and the women .
and the worst thing about this playpen ...
is the drugs and the women .
exactly !
here .
backstage passes to the sprimp concert tomorrow .
yeah .
you're fucking joking .
pay off the ambulance driver and call his sister .
i'll be there in 20 .
well , freddy , nice chat .
yeah .
look , i really gotta go , so , you know ...
and ... remember ...
before feast there must be famine , right?
yeah .
see you , freddy .
hi .
hey .
you ok?
your work said you were sick .
i've been better .
get this .
actually ...
i just hung out with shad kern .
sprimp's manager?
nothing's definite , but i've just finally got an in .
great .
but i wanna talk about us .
you and me the other night , that was real .
you can't walk away from that .
you and joe haven't been right .
it's the same with me and tanya .
it'd be difficult , joe and i being best mates , but i think joe'd be all right ...
freddy , listen to me .
things have changed .
what?
there's been a complication .
all right .
what kind of complication?
there's someone else .
in 24 hours?
i'm going to tell joe .
wait !
i'll give you a lift !
look at my hands .
they're chick hands .
then one day tomorrow comes and you die .
everybody dies .
it's ... natural .
people die all the time .
you wanna be an old , decrepit shitbag , a wrinkly little fetus man?
for what , joe?
to play one more song nobody'll listen to?
with your ... chick hands .
what am i supposed to do with these hands?
angie .
hey .
hey !
wow .
you have to try this .
what?
you just pinch you main arteries like this , and hyperventilate until you pass out .
kate .
if you need anything , like , you know , chinese takeaway or someone to hold your hand , then give me a call , yeah?
shit .
it's kate .
you'd better make yourself scarce .
and who's shad kern?
just the fucking rock manager of the year !
stool of satan , gutter midgets , lovestain .
and the biggest fuckin 'band in the country .
sprimp?
ah , sprimp !
yeah , sprimp !
i've been invited backstage after the concert to hang out with shad and the band !
where's joe?
he's gonna flip when he hears this !
didn't see that coming .
joe , get off me !
what are you doing? !
you piece of dog shit !
you're ramming her , aren't you?
kate !
who's ramming kate?
you're nuts !
no , your nuts , slapping her arse while you bang her !
it's your kid , isn't it?
no , it isn't .
why else would she tell you first?
kate's pregnant?
what's going on?
this is making my head hurt !
how long have you been fucking her?
i didn't fuck her !
we just kissed , once .
shoulda put a condom on your tongue .
lowlife !
aren't you still with tanya?
shut up , bruno !
everybody shut up !
katie's pregnant with your kid , man that's it !
but you're with tanya?
yes .
not any more .
wait , tan !
tanya !
we never had sex .
funny , you could say that about us .
tanya , nothing happened .
you know , nothing .
nada .
nyet .
so you're saying you feel nothing for her , is that it?
nyet?
i didn't think so .
tanya , listen .
it's ok .
i don't love you , freddy .
come on , we're just friends anyway .
look , it's time to move on .
new girlfriend .
new bass player .
what the fuck is in me? !
my quick unpick .
i was looking for that .
quick unpick?
what the fuck is that?
a hook you use to unpick stitching .
why leave that lyin 'around?
looks like it's in good and tight .
can you pull it out?
good advice .
you should've followed it .
tanya , please .
ok !
jesus christ !
try not to cry , all right?
bend over !
and to think , this is how i'll always remember you .
freddy , i'm glad you're here .
ex girlfriend coming through .
tanya ...
listen , there's nothing going on .
i told him i hadn't even kissed another guy , and then i remembered you , and itjust kind of slipped out .
then he said he always thought we were screwing around , so i said " well , you can think what you like .
i feel awful about you and tanya .
that's all right .
she was always a bit of a pain in the arse .
so , are you ok?
yeah .
no , i ...
i don't know .
everything's just all over the place .
things'll get better .
you wanna come to a sprimp concert?
thanks for inviting me , freddy .
man , i love being backstage at these things .
sprimp are hot !
you managed us for a year and i never asked what music you like .
oh , i like all kinds of music .
ok .
but this could be our last chance to keep the band together , so don't screw it up .
there he is .
yeah .
some notes .
for your pitch .
has this had any contact with your rectum?
st peter says " that's the bad news .
karen carpenter's on drums !
shad .
guys , this is teddy .
says he's got a killer band , ain't that right , teddy?
freddy .
i dig your work , guys .
what's a killer band got to do to get you to manage 'em?
well , you've got to have a shit hot demo with a new sound .
that's how toby here got my attention .
no , forget that .
make sure this bastard comes to your next gig , huh?
and don't take no for an answer .
it's rock and roll , dude .
knock 'em dead , guys .
how you doin '?
so , seriously , what does a guy ...
what does a guy with a killer band have to do to get shad kern to manage them?
they've got a sound .
a unique fucking sound .
i can guarantee it .
what the fuck is this?
just bruno , our roadie .
co manager .
enjoy the gig .
what are you doing?
ladies and gentlemen , sprimp !
shad , wait .
i could've sold you out with that redhead , but i didn't .
your thanks is to fob me off with backstage passes to this show?
on the street , these guys are a fuckin 'joke .
all i wanted was for you to hear us play .
anyway , it's your loss , man .
call my office , tell me where you're playing , and i'll be there .
you won't be disappointed , shad !
mr kern !
the wait .
my favourite part .
will she come on like a tiger in slow motion , or fast and rude like a raging hand grenade of bliss?
prepare to surrender .
prepare to lose all control .
come on , baby , give it to me .
give me a ten , an arse kicking , perfect high .
tighten , release .
breathe in , breathe out .
this is the one .
it's gonna be the one .
go , ten .
come on , baby , go !
oh , shit !
sorry , man .
thought you were satan .
mate , take my advice .
talk to her .
remember , chicks say " i hate your guts , " and they mean " buy me a dozen roses .
i never wanna see your face again " means " if you make me laugh , i might blow you .
you get my drift?
do you love her?
then go out there and get her back .
you're right .
fuck it !
you're right .
now you're talking !
and here .
it'll help take the edge off .
bugger off !
you and me and baby makes three ,

we agreed ...
i've agreed to stick with the band on a strictly professional basis .
what about joe?
screw him for not turning up today .
whoa , mate , he's just pissed off .
you did pork his old lady .
i didn't pork his old lady !
look , if you can get shad kern to manage us , even i'd pork ya .
look , can we just get this wet dream right?
so this kern guy , he wants to sign us?
he wants to hear us play .
whatever , he's on the hook .
all we need is a gig .
great .
it's " magical mystery gig that'll never happen " time again .
thommo's gonna rent us this place .
brilliant .
and that parsimonious prick is doing this to win the nobel prize for humanity?
yeah .
and 1200 bucks .
that's all we've gotta guarantee him .
we keep the door and get drinks at staff prices .
cool .
but where are we gonna get 1200 bucks?
can't you sell some of your pills?
no way .
that makes me a pusher , amigo .
tan , what about your parents?
no .
god .
next stupid idea?
i've got one .
there's no point even talking about it unless we know that joe's in .
bust up?
go back with that slut?
kate is not a slut .
that's why she's got her tongue down the throat of your best friend .
angie , don't .
let's ask little joe what he thinks .
stop it .
oh , g'day , big fella .
joe's upstairs .
thanks , kev .
how you keepin ', man?
tops , matey .
i'd forgotten how good cornflakes were .
this is ...
it's not normal , angie .
fuck normal .
who wants normal?
i do .
and kate's normal .
having a baby is normal .
i need lots of ... normal .
do you always ejaculate over a girl when you're trying to break up with her?
it's original , i'll give you that .
are you crazy?
put some antiseptic on it .
jesus .
think you can get rid of me?
you'll never get rid of me , joe .
ever .
look , you are a mind blowing fuck , but we have to cool it , ok?
what do you want?
what?
you idiot .
katie's pregnant and you're cheating on her .
no , i'm not .
look , not now .
i was just breaking up with her , all right?
i came to tell you sprimp's manager wants to see a gig .
you gotta come up with 240 bucks , fast .
you don't deserve her , man .
oh , and you do?
oh , freddy?
try and use this against me with kate and you can forget the fucking band .
i mean it .
i can't guarantee they'll be 100 % smooth , but your donations will really help my research .
i'm a seven foot tall blonde amazon goddess with violet eyes and breasts so big they meet behind my back .
no , mate .
sod off !
i can't guarantee they'll be 100 % smooth ...
fuck you too , you degenerate floating cake of whale shit !
jesus !
you sexy degenerate , you .
here you go .
that's not an official wilderness society suit !
you're a fake !
you're the fake .
you're dead !
fuck you , man !
and don't come back !
this time joe's gone too far .
he's deluded himself before , but not like this .
why does he always say things he doesn't really mean?
i mean , could he think about my feelings forjust a minute?
it's like at a party when there's one piece of cheese left on the plate .
the person next to you obviously wants it , but makes a point of offering it to you first .
stuff like that really shits me .
i love it when it rains .
for a moment , everything's new again .
... ready to rumble !
you're feelin 'pretty good then?
yeah .
it's what it's all about , man .
we'll remember this night for ever .
dumplings?
it's great .
things are going so well for you .
yeah , well , we've only raised 100 bucks .
you'll get there .
i was just worried you and joe were gonna bust up the band over all this .
so , have you finished that song we wrote?
the killer opener?
i'm still working on it .
think it'll turn out ok?
i hope so .
some days , don't you wish you could just escape?
joe and i are over .
how did he take it?
he doesn't know yet .
it's the right thing for both of us .
he just hasn't been around for me to tell him .
sorry , you were saying?
no .
it's nothing .
nothing .
hey , you want the last one?
no , no , you ...
yeah , you do .
you reckon anybody likes fortune cookies?
joe .
where've you been?
the family planning centre .
they suggested that the father to be ...
father to be?
yeah .
that he watch something for 24 hours .
teaches responsibility .
what are you talking about?
meet melly .
most blokes only look after it for a day , i'm gonna do it for a whole month .
joe ...
just watch me .
i'll get my shit together , you'll see .
i will not let her out of my sight , ever .
joe , what you're doing is great .
but you and me , the way that it's been ...
i've changed .
you'll see .
it's not gonna work .
it's over .
freddy's not the guy for you , kate .
i know he's not .
please , joe , don't do this .
just give me a chance , ok?
i can be normal .
watch me .
it's nap time .
so we'll see you later .
everything's gonna be fine .
i guarantee it .
you were right , freddy .
they didn't even check the date .
brunes .
brunes !
focus .
the idea is to get shad to come to rehearsal , save a thousand bucks , yeah?
he'll be on the side of the stage .
wait here .
what if i see him first?
find me .
what if there's no time?
find me .
no cheating .
shadling !
you said you'd listen to the whole demo .
baby .
you know i think you've got a great sound .
then manage me .
i'll manage you ...
... if you leave toby .
that's so romantic .
but you know that's not an option .
we don't wanna rock the boat , do we?
i think you should listen to track two .
oh , hey .
shad .
it's bruno .
in a pinch management?
oh , yeah ...
shad , look , i know you said you'd come to our next gig and all , but we thought maybe you'd like to come to a rehearsal instead , you know?
get ajump on the whole ...
c'mon , baby , don't play with me now .
you really do have to hear them live ...
shad , is this a good time for you?
no !
don't you dare tease me !
yeah !
the demo rocks !
what do you mean ...
oh !
ah !
a demo?
fuck , yes !
the truth is , we can't afford to do a demo ...
i love the demo !
oh , give it to me .
you're saying you'd give it a serious listen?
now you've got it !
oh , here we go !
i get it !
we're just going to have to get you one then !
you won't be sorry , shad .
i'll be in touch , all right?
i'll get the contracts drawn up tomorrow .
they caught you in the make up room , so they checked the pass .
what's it matter?
now we know what shad wants a demo .
great .
now instead of finding a grand , we've gotta find three !
you are not gonna believe what joe's gone and done .
so you know?
you've met his little friend?
yeah .
katie , i'm so sorry .
you are?
course .
couldn't believe he screwed around on you .
i tried to tell you , but a plane flew over , and you said it was over anyway , so i figured the band was going really well , and shad wanted to ...
you didn't know?
i came to talk to you about joe buying a melon as a baby substitute , but you're telling me that all this time he's been having an affair , and you didn't tell me about it for the sake of your worthless fucking band?
yeah , but ...
how selfish can you get?
to think i actually thought that you and i ...
but that was all bullshit .
no , that was real !
i understand how you feel ...
freddy , you have no idea .
i trusted you .
how do you open this fucking door?
just pull it .
breaking up's the best thing that ever happened to me .
free to roam , free to rage , free to have a freakin 'orgasm occasionally ...
what's wrong with guys today?
they couldn't find their way around a supermarket , let alone a woman's body .
oh , my god .
feeding time on the planet of the apes .
oh , shit , tan .
if only it wasn't so tragically hip to be bi these days .
to subjugate is to make subservient or submissive .
false .
incorrect .
precognition is the ability to see into the future .
what , like me and you going out on a date or something?
dream on , dickhead .
hello?
katie , it's me ...
oh , what? !
aha !
a hole in one , right there .
one night stands seem weird to me .
sex with a stranger is the thrill of the unexpected .
one minute you're sitting in a pub , the next , you're buck naked with a tongue rooting around your bunghole .
maybe i don't feel like planting my heels on the ceiling and yelling " come and get it !
sexual frustration can be frustrating .
have you seen what's going on?
no .
thommo?
what's the story?
what story would that be , freddo?
ah .
well , laddie , once upon a time there was a barman named thommo , who got sick of selling alcoholic refreshment to losers and half wits in a shit part of town .
so he sold half his equity to the evil development man , who turned around and filled his joint with pokies .
and then thommo lived happily ever after , sailing around the world on his gigantic fuckin 'yacht .
what's more important , thommo?
us?
we've supported you for years .
or pimpin 'out your pub for a quick buck?
what about the bands , man?
what about 'em?
i now officially consider you the enemy .
come on , guys , let's get outta here .
i'll send you a postcard , you dick .
god , a demo?
they're so expensive !
shad was practically begging me for it .
jeez , tan , we can't pass this up .
yeah .
come on .
no !
the answer's no .
come on .
you know how tight they are .
look , any money given comes with serious psychological strings attached .
all right !
but we do it my way or we don't do it at all .
and you all have to be there .
even joe .
told you she'd crack .
just have to put the pressure on .
kate?
nah , nah .
cornflakes?
no , i'm good .
nah , the only time kate came round was to drop off a garbage bag full of joe's stuff .
she didn't wanna talk to him .
all right .
thanks , kev .
freddy ...
he really screwed it up good , didn't he?
yeah .
we both did .
well , we're musos .
we're meant to screw up when it comes to women .
i'll see you around , kev .
hey .
giant squid was pretty cool , hey?
remember that gig we played ...
you're being rude .
what?
you didn't say hello .
yeah , i did .
i just said ...
to melly .
hey , melly .
anyway , remember the gig ...
don't try to memory lane me .
we could use that feeling .
old news , mate .
we're better now .
you and i are stronger than this bullshit , aren't we?
yeah , and what about you and kate?
for some reason , i didn't think you'd mind .
she's my girl .
i know .
itjust didn't seem like it .
anyway , whatever , man .
look , i'm here about the band .
this is our chance .
i'm telling you , i'm gonna make this thing happen .
and if you want to come along for the ride , then ... well , that'd be really cool .
it's up to you .
great .
joe's lost it .
it's a difficult time .
and for me .
you don't see me breast feeding mangoes .
melons .
whatever !
is the table set?
maybe i should put on some music .
no , it'll just make them tense .
oh , guys , i'm sorry i'm late , but melly was a little bit grumpy on the way over .
joe , please , no melons !
just for tonight .
shouldn't little mellys be in bed by now?
relax !
here 's to bleeding your parents dry .
i envy you musicians .
no cares , no money worries .
no money !
yeah .
a rich guy like you must be so stressed out you can't even take a dump without an accountant present .
yeah !
yeah .
freddy , could you give me a hand , please?
sure .
excuse me .
this is all wrong .
there's no way i can ask them for money tonight .
c'mon , chill , tan .
you can do it .
ease us through .
we'll murder lucy later .
goin 'pretty well out there , eh?
i feel kind of weird , man .
an early phase that passes .
what?
nothin '.
all right , i slipped something in the shots .
you guys needed to relax .
dude , i'm hallucinating !
impossible .
be cool .
trust me , it's very mild .
look at me .
i'm as solid as a rock .
i'm so glad you came over , because i wanted to say thank you for everything you've done .
but there's also something that i wanted to ask you .
um ...
tan !
your head !
is your friend all right , tanya?
he does that .
anyway , what i wanted to mention was that we've got an opportunity to cut a demo ...
i'm sorry .
i don't understand .
what kind of a demo?
you know , like a sampler of our music ...
we've got to be clear that uni comes first that's a career .
the band comes second that's a hobby .
you've got to prioritise .
what the fuck is happening?
tanya , listen carefully .
this is liquid ecstasy .
it produces a subtle feeling of well being .
this is some hardcore lsd i forgot i had in my kit .
i'm gonna rip open your skull and piss in the cavity where your brain should be !
tan !
don't move !
my parents , you dickhead !
they're clean .
so's joe .
hello , boys and girls !
guess who !
oh , this shit is kind of robust .
that's right .
we're gonna dance all night , dance all day .
fire extinguisher !
someone call the fire brigade !
in here , freddy !
freddy , i trusted you .
you can't have my soul !
die , fucker , die !
tanya?
sweetie?
are you ok?
don't come in here !
there's been a bit of a problem .
tanya , what's going on?
we think the macadamia nuts are off .
tanya , darling , should we call a doctor?
no , no doctors .
we just need to have a vomit and a lie down .
i'll just give you a call in the morning .
it's ok , tan .
joe's still out there .
excuse me .
do you have any idea what's going on here , son?
aw !
my melon's got a pooey nappy .
20 years ago , a groupie would've washed my undergruns for free .
just to sniff 'em .
ah , the memories .
now i hang around here for hours every laundry day , praying that the blonde with the double serving of funbags will show up so i can watch her unmentionables flip flop around in the fuckin 'dryer .
what kind of a dad am i?
she's just rotting away back here .
you can sell her .
use the cash to make that demo .
you've got to be kidding .
no .
come on , take it .
not for this demo .
it's not worth it .
come on , son .
let me give you somethin '.
she's just rotting away back here .
you can sell her .
use the cash to make your demo .
hang on , kevin , you can't ...
i know , i know .
we've had some good times .
great times .
but , you know , they're all up here .
nothin 'sadder than an old rocker that doesn't know when to quit .
unless you're the stones , of course .
you know what i mean?
tan , hey .
it's not freddy's idea .
this is somethin 'i wanna do .
i didn't make him do it .
we didn't make him .
are you speaking for him now?
i was just saying it wasn't my idea ...
you don't get it , do you?
this is your time .
right now .
you've got to grab it .
you've gotta grab it ...
with both hands ...
and don't let go ooh !
don't let go oh !
oh , man .
i know someone who'd kill his own mother to get his hands on one of these .
good , luce .
let him know it's for sale .
kev , you rock .
kate .
god , don't do that .
how's the baby?
did you get an ultrasound?
listen close , joe .
ultrasound , no .
abortion , yes .
yes , please , after what you've done .
how was i so blind?
wait .
an abortion?
jesus , don't look at me like that .
i haven't done it yet .
you'd be murdering our kid !
joe , you're scaring me .
just stop following me and leave me alone .
fuck , that was hot !
so , let's do that cuban thing now .
no , the speed metal track .
no , no , why don't you do the ballad?
no , the cuban thing shows we have range .
no , we're doin 'the new one .
the killer opener?
you have a fall?
we've barely rehearsed it .
we're doin 'it .
we've got time for one more?
sure .
over the top , dudes !
rip that metal , man !
all right .
luce , count it in .
one , two , three , four !
yeah , so you split your mortgage between fixed and variable and you refinance when the interest drops .
more attitude , guys .
stronger .
scarlet , about that studio .
scarlet .
about that studio i wanted you to see .
i've organised it for later .
oh , sorry , i forgot to mention .
toby and i are going to the channel x party .
you could come with us .
yeah , man , you should come .
yeah?
shad , it's freddy .
feast and famine " freddy?
i've got the demo we talked about .
did we?
i guess we did .
why don't you drop it into my office and i'll listen to it asap .
fuck it , can you get it to me personally?
i may be looking for some real talent .
ok .
i'll meet you where i left my wallet .
the palace?
ok , ten o'clock .
i'll see you there , shad !
yeah !
with me and freddy pimpin 'the band , you'll be the talk of the town !
no , fuck it .
the world !
come on , then .
kick arse !
brunes , i want to talk to you about that .
what about?
i thought when i give the demo to shad , i'd do it on my own .
just you and me , right?
no , just me .
you know , i wanna schmooze him a bit , one on one .
you understand that , right?
yeah .
sure .
fuck !
i hope you don't mind .
i let myself in .
what are you doin '?
you should give this a go .
red dye number two .
what's wrong , sugar?
it's kate .
she's killing the baby .
oh .
poor sweetie .
hug , hm?
that's what i said !
now you're talking !
let's celebrate .
they're a 7 . 5 .
you love to piss me off .
it's not my idea of a good time .
try one .
might stop you rushing ahead of the beat .
i'm on the beat .
you're the one who lags .
if you can't move , you can't groove .
you idiot .
you say the most stupid things !
idiot?
i do not !
compared to me ...
you show no respect for me at all !
you are so fucking wrong !
you're just a rich , untalented bitch !
hey ...
look ...
ow !
ok ...
no .
look , tanya ...
no , man .
truce?
i know i said i wouldn't talk about us , but ...
we agreed .
just a meal .
i have to get this off my chest .
freddy ...
just relax , just let me finish .
the band's got a real shot with this , and i want you to be a part of it .
i fucked up once .
i'm not gonna do it again .
freddy , i understand why you did what you did .
the band was your dream long before i was in the picture .
so?
what happens when you do a world tour?
well , you can come .
and what do we do with the baby?
i'm having it .
that's cool .
not a problem .
actually , it is a problem .
you've gotta see this thing with the band through .
and what about that night?
it was ... a beautiful kiss .
you're gonna meet lots of gorgeous women on the road with much less baggage than me .
you said nothin 'was goin 'on !
stop it !
nothing is going on !
stop it !
i should just go now .
goodbye , freddy .
kate , wait .
joe , wait !
melly !
dada !
melly !
what the fuck have you done , man?
fuck !
fuck you !
fuck you , too !
fuckin 'freddy .
ungrateful little gutter mongrel .
i work my balls down to a stump for him and the band , and when the big moment comes , he express posts me a " fuck you " and steals all the glory for himself .
no loyalty , that's his problem .
mm .
some indian would be great .
yeah !
some vindaloo would really hit the spot .
that's my pole she's twirlin 'on .
yeah .
yeah?
i need you to get to the palace .
yeah?
well , guess what?
roadie hours are over for the day , so you can just fuck off !
stop dickin 'around .
it's important .
i'll be there with the demo , but i've gotta find joe .
i need you to stop shad from leaving .
bruno's onto it !
it's ok , sugar .
melly !
hey .
there's no need to be upset .
shad .
i mean , mr kern .
bruno .
in a pinch management?
where's freddy?
he's not far behind .
angie , i can't do this .
of course you can .
oh , no .
joe?
joe !
joe , what are you doin ', man?
where's angie?
what are you talkin 'about?
angie !
joe , there's no one here .
where ... where is she?
just let me help you .
don't tell anyone , ok?
just don't tell anyone !
shit !
freddy's coming !
joe !
joe !
how'd it go with shad?
you guys seen joe?
i'm really worried about him , man .
he's acting really weird .
joe?
joe?
you checked the house?
you're right , babe .
maybe he's in the house .
babe?
has the whole fucking world gone insane?
what's the problem , freddy?
we broke up .
i don't give a shit about that .
joe's really flipped out .
i'm serious .
hello?
freddy , someone here wants to talk to you .
listen , you little fuckwit ...
shad .
i'm sorry ...
there are rules , freddy .
and one of them is , don't fuck with my time .
get your arse here before i finish my drink or be prepared for a very long famine !
fellas , can you give us a hand?
it's joe .
won't answer his door .
joey !
oh , jesus !
joey !
not you too !
kev , give us some room .
joey !
call an ambulance .
what's he taken?
that .
sleeping tablets .
sedatives .
what do i do?
we need an ambulance .
joey !
he's got a pulse , mate .
he's got a pulse .
i don't know .
he's taken them all .
i'm goin 'with him .
damn .
you saved his life , man .
can we have some music in here to drown that shit out? !
take a hike , loser .
fuck !
you fuck !
i'm gonna kill you !
after that , everything just turned to shit .
joe , the band , my hopes for katie ...
the strange thing was , i still had this need to play .
music is a great thing to lose yourself in .
and , man , was i lost .
give it up for the rockin 'sounds of alternate current .
oh , no , this is ok .
the pay's pretty good and ... killer crowds ...
i was sittin 'right there .
i hear joe's doin 'better .
do you hear from the others much?
no , it's over .
kind of figure i should just lay low for a while , you know?
hey , bon !
you're the king !
it's just an act , mate .
fuck off !
oh , yeah?
fuck you , dickhead .
now , look .
the real reason i'm here , i've got some great news .
you got us a gig?
who told you?
are you serious?
does dog shit love shoes?
see?
there you are .
right there .
when i saw it i thought it was a printing error .
no error .
you guys are booked to play at homebake !
this is our chance to really cook !
i don't understand , man .
it was destiny .
that's only her stage name , of course .
my friend destiny , her brother , he books all the bands for homebake .
it was under my nose all along !
she hooked me up just like that .
totally .
bruno makes a promise , bruno delivers .
here you are , joe .
lucy always said i'd find my perfect 10 sometime .
bingo .
prozac .
so , homebake , eh?
yeah .
kev said they're thinking of letting you out soon .
no .
i don't think i'm ready for it .
you guys should still do it .
i won't be pissed off , man , i promise .
hey , haven't you always said guitarists were as common as flies around a sheep's arse?
been practising?
kate brought it over .
i haven't picked it up yet .
i'll get there .
how's she going?
good .
she said technically i never really cheated on her .
it was more of a mind fuck , really .
listen , i'm sorry i wasn't there for you , man .
it's ok .
it was down to me , nobody else .
things are a lot clearer now .
so , you thought of giving it another shot with kate?
you've been having way too much of that prozac , dude .
hey .
i just thought of a guitarist .
i can't , fellas .
shit , i'd love to , but ...
i haven't been on stage in 15 years .
oh , come on .
you know all the songs .
no , i can't .
luce .
man , my baby !
i bought it back off the guy i sold it to .
the bastard drove a hard bargain though .
c'mon , kev !
yeah , ok .
yeah !
yeah , kev !
i'm really gonna miss you .
like i told joe , my folks have heaps of room .
so , any time you guys wanna visit ...
yeah , yeah , that'd be great .
shame you're gonna miss the gig .
blame it on the movers .
it's funny , you know .
i really thought you two would make it .
it's for the best .
joe's the dad .
he won't be left out , i promise .
no , i ...
i was talking about freddy .
but right now , he's really putting everything into this gig .
yeah .
it's everything he ever wanted .
he must be on a cloud .
... ready to rumble !
so you're feelin 'pretty good?
yeah , it's what it's all about , man !
we're gonna remember this night for ever .
kate , it's freddy .
this number has been disconnected .
please check the number and call again .
are we ready?
yeah !
thou , thee and this ...
gonna be the hottest fucking gig ever , eh?
who's got the set list?
lucy !
i ain't got it .
freddy's got it .
i don't have it .
are you joking?
you guys ...
i gave it to you five minutes ago .
don't you ever stop arguing?
joe !
think i'd miss my only chance to play at homebake?
welcome home , son !
ok , ok , come on .
schmaltzy crap later .
let's get this show on the road !
ah , this is it , eh?
so where's kate?
she meeting us there?
no .
she's going to melbourne with the movers at three .
movers?
she's goin 'to her parents '.
i thought you knew , man .
are we ready?
all right !
let's do it !
come on .
i'm not blind , freddy , look , i've been scared before .
fuck , i've been known to crap my pants , remember?
don't let your fear get in the way , mate .
the nerves'll disappear as soon as you start that first song .
guarantee it .
fuck it .
that's the spirit .
a short cut .
ok , that everything , love?
yeah .
talk to me , freddy .
this isn't a short cut , is it?
no !
didn't think so .
oh , no .
no , not now , you piece of shit !
shit !
hang on a minute .
this is kate's place .
stop !
in the name of love !
let's go , mate !
there it is !
come on , mate , speed up !
oh , no .
will you pay sunni's speeding fine?
i don't think so .
if sunni doesn't friggin 'step on it , i'll shove sunni's beaded seat cover up sunni's arse !
no need for intimidation tactics .
you missed it !
go to the side !
oi !
kate !
katie !
look out !
the other side .
ok !
on my way .
what the bloody hell do you think you're doin '?
aren't you meant to be on stage?
this is exactly where i should be .
you'll never forgive yourself , and you'll never forgive me .
that night , when everything changed , when you said my dream was only stupid if i gave it up ...
well , i'm not giving you up .
no way .
have you got room for me in melbourne?
come on , you'll be late for your gig .
record crowds are expected at homebake .
coming up on triple j , we'll hear megaband sprimp live from the festival .
don't worry .
when you start playing , they'll come running , you'll see .
how could she?
yeah , well , she got what she wanted .
a nice juicy recording deal , a few added extras ...
but running off with a sound engineer !
i'm a rock star !
hey .
come on .
pour the pain into your music , man .
that's it , that's it .
five minutes , guys .
there they are .
hey !
freddy .
hey .
thanks , joe .
you ready to rock and roll?
excuse me .
who's in charge here?
i am .
yeah .
that's me , actually .
bumped?
no !
of all the asinine , fucked up things !
sorry , guys .
we're runnin 'late , and sprimp's contract requires all other stages to be shut down when they're playing .
nothin 'i can do .
you were so close .
there's gotta be something we can do .
quick , come with me .
guys !
guys , wait up !
guys , pick it up .
we're running behind .
four quad boxes stage right .
i need two a/ c thirties ...
excuse me .
i'm writing this article on roadies , the unsung heroes of australian rock .
could i talk to you after the show?
this is it .
let's rock and roll .
give the kids a go , fellas .
hello .
hello , sydney .
thank you for comin 'out in support of live music , and say no to pokies !
my name's freddy , and ...
jim morrison lives , man !
fascists !
let 'em play !
you !
how the fuck did you get in here?
freddy !
freddy !
freddy !
gimme a chance .
let me play one song .
you had your chance .
get 'em outta here .
you owe me !
wait right there .
what did you say to me?
toby could still find out you're bangin 'his chick .
i owe you nothing .
scarlet chewed him up and spat him out , so it doesn't matter that i was banging his girl the whole time .
i could've had an orgy with his cousin , sister , grandparents and scarlet , and that moron still wouldn't have known .
hey , guys .
dig your work .
toby .
mate ...
go , freddy !
go !
freddy !
freddy !
freddy !
consider yourself fired , wanker .
how you doin '?
this song's a bit of a new one for us .
let 'em play .
if they're any good , it'll give me an edge on the deal .
i hope you don't mind , but , uh , it's kind of a killer opener .
my big moment .
the moment i finally had to admit to myself that we just weren't very good .
but sucking as much as we did that day and our suckage factor was enormous we still got to play in front of a whole country full of people .
it was the most fun it was humanly possible for any of us to ever have .
about seven months later , katie and i got married .
joe was best man .
joe junior made an appearance too .
bruno won a million bucks in some contest by finding a purple chocca .
lucky sod !
so he bought the palace right out from under that butt crumb thommo .
we took the pokies and smashed them all with polo mallets .
ladies and gentlemen , how we doin '?
me and joe manage bruno's , and now the bands are back .
there's been a bit of a scheduling mix up .
in the meantime , the house band's gonna rip through a few for ya .
every few months , i give a band the wrong start time and slip us in ahead of them .
we might suck , but i never said we were idiots .
tanya finished uni and went into anger management .
lucy was the surprising one .
he got a degree in pharmacy and went into business .
what goes around , comes around , i guess .
joe kept up his medication and fell in love with a primary school teacher .
now , instead of one kid , he's got 35 .
kevin .
well , he's the same .
some things just don't need to change .
that's good , right?
as for katie , she never got to experience the highs and lows of being a rock star's wife .
but i think she's ok with it .
and me , a rock star?
not my destiny .
still , you don't have to be a rock star to feel like one .
