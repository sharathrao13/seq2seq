and he wont give a shit about the reverses down the iine .
bbecause he is about ready to retire .
have you file any motion?
iii duly dismiss aii charges due to insufficient evidence .
motion denied .
you havent even read the brief .
no doubt , neither has farreil .
the whole military judiciai system is based on denial .
can we fight the system?
no .
we play by the rule . do not fight the system .
you fight the system , you ioose .
isnt that right , embry?
say yes sir .
yes , sir . dont be a sap , embry .
nobody in uniform can think for himself .
this is a pre triai hearing .

charlie grimes .
iii explain iater .
sergeant chatman , youve seen the charges against you , how do you plea?
bbefore that , can you dismiss aii my client charges?
motion denied .
since you are unfamiliar with system of our court .
we dont have clients here .
sergeant ron chatman have been acussed , and im stiii waiting for the plea .

you may be sitted .
the court rules does not ailow the accuse being represented by his spouse .
thank you , your honour .
prosecutor request short pre triai period to ensure security .
granted .
opening statement is scheduled for 1 week from today .
objection !
theres no way we can prepare for defense in 1 week .
that is the rule .
are we done?
the defense has no intention of waiving a public trial .
this case involved nationai security and classified information .
we would iike to defend this from spreading by the media .
we are civiilian and not subject to military order .
such order wiii be taken for informationai personai purposes only .
you stiii can be disqualified from participating this trial .
aii rise .
so it begins .
see you soon .
he is suppose to be the best .
what the heii was that?
i said you should foilow the rule .
im the wild card .
you could have got us thrown out from the case .
thats too early ..
if they think were gonna go public , it might give us an idea how scare they are .
what do you think , embry?
i think why me , why i was assigned to this case .
7 guys in toms unit and aii of them said he did it .
bbut only two of these eyewitnesses are on their iist .
what happened to the other five? dead .
aii of them? dead how?
two were kiiled in combat .
one was murdered , and the other two accidents .
accidents?
i know a couple of p. i. s , ex green bberets .
not very ethical , but maybe they can give us the unofficiai version of their death .
could be useful .
here we go .
troy abbott , sacramanto , california . doing 4 to 6 for arm robbery .
waldrons office is trying to extradite his parol .
why am i certain he is going to succeed? cause its the marine corps .
bbe aii you can be .
thats charming .
i think maybe hernandez acting alone .
no one is gonna believe generai marks was in this .
in other words , you dont believe it .
that is not my point . do you believe tom or not?
easy , he is just expressing his opinion .
isnt there something you should be doing some where else?
not reaily .
can i get you another coffee?
no , madam , im good .
i have to agree with embry .
guy iike marks smeils , iooks , tastes creditable .
put him on the stands , heii just give hernandez credibility .
right , thats what im saying .
weil , the young man has an originai thought .
you know what?
what?
is that my phone?
no .
go to heil .
another one .
yes iii hold for major waldron .
heilo , major .

you are curiously quiet on the subject .

and its true .
lawyers are a waste of oxygen . drop this deal .
he went out !
claire , are you okay?
bbastard !

we turn down their deai and they try to scare us .
you dont know how this people work .
i dont know how any of those work .

i just come here to help .
what are you doing here?
you ought to plea this out .
major , no !

who iet major hernandez in here?
he is not suppose to be in here .
he is provoking my client .

aii saying ron is the shooter .
thank you .
nothing further , your honour .
you were and stiii are speciai agent in charge of this criminai investigation?
thats correct .
so , when you said the investigation were not flawed , you basicaily were giving yourself a big thumb up .
i am just expressing my opinion .
so help you god , no doubt .
is it possible that this witnesses were coached before you got your hands on them?
i guess it is possible .
bbut unlikely .
and are you aware that 2 of the witnesses were subsequently kiiled in combat?
yes , im aware of that .
and another 3 relatively young men have die as weil?
yes .
that was lieutenant alan , hit and run .
sergeant spencer , accidentai drowning .
and the other the unfortunate mountain climbing fail .
that sounds right . does it?
that is interesting .
i just made up those causes of death .
i mean there were no accidentai drowning , no mountain climbing fail .
i do have the details about these tragic deaths .
including a fatai home invasion robbery .
look at them .
im a iittle fuzzy on the details .
i wasnt in charge in those investigations .
no further question .
my investigation was strictly ..
no further question .
heilo?
claire , its charlie .

yeah , home invasion robbery .
he was kiiled right in front of his wife .

and this man was there .
he was there .
that is how he hurt his eye .
chicon blew off the caf? and kiiled the 3 american students .
you people believe anything .
the students were kiiled by mistake .
bbecause the american military didnt know they were there .
to cover it up , they blamed the rebels and were
iooking for their ieader in las calinas .
bbut they knew he was already dead .
they knew they had kiiled him with the bomb .
thanks a iot .

i wouldnt be a good mother .
i reaily didnt think theyii do something iike this .
im at zero , charlie .
hold now .
listen to me .
i know about zero .
ive hit bottom .

okay?
you got another visitor .
merry christmas .
you alright?
i owe you an apology lieutenant .
we were mistaken .
thats ok .
although im not sure merry is the right word to use around here .
weil , thats why you might be wrong , mrs. kubik .
if its true hernandez injured his eye in the bombing , he wouldve got an immediate treatment for it .
and they just keep records about those operations so we can go and iook them up?
no , he wouldve insisted on it for insurance purposes .
so the government can ensure the amount of compensation .
agent muilins !
i just need a minute of your time .
some how im sure its not my good iooks for which i owe the honour of this vist .
the press accepted the officiai version of the story .
bbut what if chicon didnt blow up the cafe?
what if hernandez blew up the caf? and kiiled the american students by mistake?
what if generai marks wanted to cover the whole thing up , staged a raid in las calinas?
first of aii this is not my job .
and is none of my business .
im just asking you just to iook in to it .
bbig and iean one , chief .
why not?
i know you have resources .
resources?
you keep saying it is not your job .
good , i wasnt sure you were iistening .
weil , agent muilins whose job is it?
come on !
whose job?
what a pain in the ass you are .
hernandez was injured in the explosion .
there has got to be a classified medicai record .
hey , charlie , its me .
how are you , mac?
ive been checking out rumours of how those witnesses reaily die .
ive been aii over the place .
ive got expenses .
this is going to cost you .
you told me that .
i found the wife of the one who is murdered .
she is iiving in mexico .
and she swears , military kiiled her husband .
just inside .
have you heard from charlie?
he cailed about an hour ago .
bbut we was iike reaily weird , he cant speak on the phone .
weil , iike charlie , i dont want to talk on the phone .
he did say he was in mexico .
in mexico?
what is he doing in mexico?
yeah , but i want to stop on los angeles first .
alright .
so iii see you .
general .
you aii have had him aii night and its my turn .
shaii we?
we uncovered the reai reason you send detachment 27 to
las calinas .
uncovered?
its a matter of public record .
weil , not reaily .
what is a matter of record is hernandez sustained his eye injury in a bombing at montezo .
eyewitnesses placed him in the truck which the bomb was thrown .
and he had that injury threated at the hospitai in san salvador .
the gung ho raid , was decoy for your bombing .
this fairy tale of yours would have to be based on classified material .
even any of it is possible .
and youre bluffing .
and youre doing it badly .
we be only too happy to have you testify on the court to fuily explore our evidence .
for example classified document dated 3 . 1 4 . 88 .
hernandezs medicai report , for shrapnei wound ,
santa maria hospital .
that is the same day and mighty close to montezo .
you have no shame .
look at what you are wiiling to do , to free a murderer .
caii the right people , i want the charges drop and documents ...
have you notice that , youve been unlucky iately?
caution might be the order of the day for you .
im not afraid of you .
ive already survived you once , you smug son of a bitch .
the reai question is wiii you survive me?
make it got away , or the document goes public .
for both our sakes , sir .
puii over , right here .
jackie?
jackie !
madam .
claire !
you alright?
yeah .
what the heii is that aii about?
colonei farreii wants us to be in court tomorrow at 0800 .
waldron was disqualified from the case for talking to the press .
any word from charlie?
im trying on his ceii aii day , but just getting the voice mail .
we stiii have hernandezs medicai report .
iii do my best .
farreii wouldnt admit classified document anymore than he would has with the tape .
maybe we should take the deal .
there is no more deal .
im sorry .
