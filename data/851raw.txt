you know what , they say we got a little bit more work to do .
that was the last song in the book , ray .
you know , fathead , it ain't never the last song .
now , band , follow me and do what i do , say what i say .
this is how we gonna do it .

## [ what'd i say? by ray charles playing ]
oh , this is it .
i'm telling you , that is out of sight .
that's a hit .
it's fantastic , ray .
but what the hell are we gonna do with this?
it's too damn long .
every night we play this , man , we bring the house down .
i'm telling you , it's guaranteed .
tom , cut the playback !
come on out here .
# baby , it's all right ##
you know what , ray , you're probably right .
i mean , i'm sure you're right .
i've never heard a sound like this before .
but how the hell are we gonna market this?
we could cut the second verse , pop back into the chorus .
man , you cut that , i'll cut you in half .
all right , all right , ray .
ahem .
we could , uh , split it up .
do a side alside b type of thing .
it's been done before .
what the hell , right?
yeah .
it's s sexual .
it's just too damn sexual for kids .
let's do it .
yeah , baby !
that's why i love y'all , man .
all right .
what the hell?
it's atlantic , right?
atlantic !
we'll release it in the summer .
there's less censorship , school's out .
the kids are ready to kick loose .
ha , okay !
tom , let's see if we can cut this pumpkin in two .
show me what your genius is all about .
you got it , boss .
yeah , that is it .
you put one on side a , put another on side b.
man , that sounds out of sight .
how you feeling , ray?
i feel groovy , baby .
i'm talking about the junk .
what?
it's starting to show .
you're scratching all the time .
you can't sit still .
hey , man , have i ever missed a date?
no , you never have .
who's the one who delivers a record in one take , hmm?
ray , you deliver better than anybody i know but i'm not talking to you as a businessman .
now come on , listen to me .
i'm worried about you .
as a friend , i'm telling you , man , your slip is hanging .
your slip is hanging .
you been hanging out with us country boys too much , man .
uh , don't worry about this , man .
if this monkey gets too heavy on my back ,
i'll get an organ grinder , man , and put him to work .

hold on , wait , wait .
cut , cut , cut .
you know , y'all know that sounds off .
ahem , you know what , the three part harmony is off .
let's start it all over again , uh , from the top with the band .
# i believe it , i believe it ##
whoa , pardner !
uh , what was that?
i knew you'd like that , ray .
it's an eight track .
we just got it .
we can record each part separately .
whoa , nellie !
you know , i can't wait to see that .
what's so funny?
nothing , " pardner .
margie's drunk .
jeff?
you should go home and sleep it off .
margie , come on now , let me take you home .
no !
i'll leave when i'm good and goddamn ready !
she's good and goddamn ready right now .
why don't you make me leave this , sucker !
teach you to treat me like some piece of meat !
i ain't shutting up !
should we get in there?
no .
get them all out , right now .
you'll have to make me leave !
you know what , jeff?
get all of them out of here .
you're a cold ass bastard !
let go of me , jeff !
you're a cold ass bastard , ray !
see , he wouldn't spit on me if my ass was on fire !
damn right i wouldn't .
put me down , jeff !
put me down !
damn it !
you dropped your shoe .
all right , come on , let's get back to work .
tom , this is what i want you to do .
we'll lay my vocals down and finish the harmony parts .
uh , how're we gonna do the harmonies , ray?
you sent the girls home .
i know what i did with the girls .
let me take care of that .
you just turn that eight track on , and i'll do the girls 'parts myself .
and go out here somewhere and find me an " oh , johnny " girl .
uh , one minute .
what the hell's an " oh , johnny " girl?
i think i've got an idea .
# last night you were dreaming #
# and i heard you say #
# oh , johnny ! #
# when you know my name is ray #
# that's why i believe right now #
# i believe #
# yes i believe #
# i say i believe right now #
# i believe #
# yes i believe ##
i got you a $5, 000 a night raise .
they're gonna up you to 15 per .
rehearsal in 10 minutes .
jeff , could you get me some cigarettes?
okay , boss .
15 per , huh?
you know , ray , your contract with atlantic is expiring in four months .
yeah .
yeah , i've got the contract with me .
they're going to double my royalties .
before we jump back in that pond ,
i thought i'd find out what else was out there .
i had a very productive chat with abc paramount yesterday .
abc?
who told you to do that , huh?
and you know , atlantic is family , just like the shaw agency .
ray , my job is to get you the best deal possible .
abc is very interested .
no .
how interested?
how about a $50, 000 advance each year for three years?
you produce your own records .
they'll deduct recording costs and give you 75 percent .
ahmet and jerry are flying in tonight , so will you put them off until i can talk things out with abc?
well , my mama said , ain't nothing wrong with talking .
hey , enough of the formalities .
come on , let's go back into the office , ray .
i hope i can call you ray .
i want you to be comfortable here .
because i'll tell you something , everything is gonna be better at abc .
moving from an indie label to a major means you can sell a lot more records , as well as attract much larger crowds , both white and negro .
yeah , but mr. clark , you know , i've been at atlantic for so long ,
i just want to give those guys a chance , you know , to at least match the offer .
mm hmm .
oh , certainly , certainly .
but , uh , i doubt they'll be able to .
we're giving you a state of the art deal here .
well , you know , since i'm producing my own records , i was wondering if i could uh , own my masters , too .
well ,
ray , we've ... we've never done that before .
no record company has .
well , i think i'm going to have to have it that way for me to leave atlantic records .
ahmet believes we're family here at atlantic .
i believe we're family here at atlantic .
obviously , you don't !
ahmet wouldn't believe it .
you know what he said , ray?
he said you would never turn your back on us .
never for a schlockmeister like sam clark !
that's rich .
sam clark's a corporate slug , who wouldn't know the difference between earl hines and art tatum !
we let you grow here , ray .
and nobody's taking credit for your talent , but we nourished it .
we let you do your thing .
god damn it !
we deserve better than this .
you know what , don't think that i don't appreciate everything you guys have done here , jerry .
ahmet , i'm very proud of the work that we've done here together .
but , atlantic has done pretty good money wise on my records , haven't they?
yes , we've done very well , ray .
you ... you were the ones that taught me that making a record is business , and find the best business deal you can .
now , 75 cents of every dollar , and owning my own masters is a pretty damn good deal .
can you match it?
ray , we would love to match it , but we just can't .
that's a better deal than sinatra gets .
i'm very proud of you .
looks like those boys are going to get a taste of country dumb .
yeah .
he'll be all right , man .
you guys always do find the best .

listen to that crap .
thought you said that abc wasn't going to force nothing on him .
they didn't .
it was ray's idea .
something new .
what are we then , jeff?
something old?
yeah , what about us?
we got to eat , too .
# other arms should reach out to me #
# other eyes smile tenderly #
# still in the peaceful dreams i see #
# the road leads back to you ##
it's a hit record .
what the hell is wrong with that?
critics say you've gone middle of the road .
the orchestra , the choir , the perry como show , man?
if i feel the music , that means it's real .
no , it ain't .
ray charles is a sellout .
the blind liberace , leaving those rocking chair roots behind .
quincy jones .
can we get a picture of these two guys?
six nine !
hey , boy .
look , here , uh , this interview is over .
i'd love to get you two together , man .
s some other time .
look at you .
how's it going , man?
you look good .
let me look at you .
you look good , too .
you hear what they're saying about me?
i just said that i ...
i can't do it no more .
i've gone middle of the road .
so crank out another hit .
let me tell you something , it ain't easy to keep on being greezy , kid .
where you blow in from?
paris .
bonjour .
yeah , man .
france is where it's at .
yeah , man .
and all that stuff you've been playing , man , it's just ... it really feels out of sight .
you know , we gotta record something together .
i mean , people will really dig it .
so , where you going after the festival?
oh , i ...
i go to d. c. , richmond , uh , virginia , georgia .
you know what , once you get the record out there , you gotta sell it .
the south , man?
i'm not doing that no more .
hey , come on , kid , that's where the money is , baby .
you know , when i left seattle with hamp , we went down there , man .
and it felt like i walked into a prison cell .
you know , a black man is a " boy " in mississippi , ray .
even if he's 80 years old .
i'm never playing to jim crow again .
ever .
if that's what you feel , baby .
i'm serious , ray .
man , we gotta do something .
well , you know , what ... what the hell , man .
you're just going to leave a lot more money on the table for me .
you're welcome to it , man .
## [ electric piano playing ]

percy just sent me some new music .

said i've lost something , said i've gone middle of the road .
they may as well say the same thing about you .
you were the soul of this band .

drunk soul of a blind junkie .
what a lovely couple .

i ain't drunk , ray .

you out of your damn mind .
you knew the rules when you got into this .
you know goddamn well i ain't gonna leave my family .
leave your family?

i don't want you to go solo .
ray , for once , i'm doing something for me .
you remember the hummingbird , right?
what?
the hummingbird , bea .
and i don't want you to go .
somebody will fetch you when your bus gets to st. augustine .
and when you get there , show them this sign , and tell them you're name is ray charles robinson .
and them sandwiches i made , don't eat 'em all at once .
you hear?
oh , please , don't make me go away .
i'll keep up with the normal kids .
i'll be good , just like george .
this ain't got nothing to do with george .
i've taken you as far as i can , baby .
them teachers at that blind school , they can teach you things i can't .
and you need an education in this world .
i don't want no education !
don't say that !
i don't !
i want to stay with you !
stop it , ray !
i won't have you living hand to mouth like me , you hear?
now listen , if you want to do something to make your mama proud , promise me , promise me you'll never let nobody turn you into no cripple .
you won't become no charity case .
you'll stand on your own two feet .
i promise .
i love you , baby .
i'm so proud of you .

we got refreshments waiting .
mr. charles !
mr. charles !
you know tonight's show is segregated?
the dance floor is whites only .
negroes can't leave the balcony .
that's how it is , man .
you know , this is georgia .
you think we don't know that?
negroes are persecuted in this state every day !
ain't nothing i can do about that .
i'm an entertainer .
and ... and we all gotta play jim crow down here .
i'm sorry , man .
now get out of here , boy .
it doesn't have to be that way .
you could change things , right here and now !
i'm sorry , son .
ain't nothing i can do .
you hear that , boy?
that's the way things are .
ain't nothing or nobody can change it .
now get your black ass out of here , and take that trash with you !
hold on ... hold on .
he ... he's right .
he's right , jeff .
get them on the bus .
you sure?
get them back on the bus !
y'all heard him !
y'all heard ray !
back on the bus !
are you serious?
get them on the bus .
i can't do nothing here .
i'm not gonna lose money just because you suddenly got religion .
ain't nothing i can do , man .
we have a contract with me .
you break it , i'll sue your ass !
i'll win , ray !
you gotta do what you gotta do .
look , i'll win big !

i told you , i'll own your ass , ray !
thank you , mr. charles .
you could be the first .
no , thank you , son .
you were right .
you're right .
you'll never work georgia again !
he filed a lawsuit and it's more than a fine , ray .
this guy's got juice .
he can get you barred from ever playing georgia again .
but he's willing to drop the suit if you'll make up the gig .
not if it's segregated .
ray ,
i admire what you're doing , man , but you can't afford this .
georgia is our highest grossing state .
i'm not playing any more to jim crow joints ever again , did you got that?
yeah .
i got it .
jeff , get those people in here so we can rehearse .
com on , y'all , let's go .

indianapolis police .

i'm just going to the bathroom .
handcuff this son of a bitch .
recognize this , ray?
heroin's a felony .
it ain't like i'm dealing it , man .
i'm not hurting nobody .
oh , no , you're hurting everybody .
your jungle music is poisoning our kids 'minds .
hey , i'm gonna put your black ass away forever .
you have to understand .
i got ...
i got a wife , i got kids .
i got responsibilities .
why don't you tell that story to these people .

ray !
was it a setup , ray?
how long you been on heroin?
come on , ray .
what did they charge you with?
# you give your hand to me #
# and then you say , hello #
# and i can hardly speak #
# my heart is beating so #
# and anyone can tell #
# you think you know me well #
# but you , you don't know me at all ##
hi , baby .
david .
uh , uh , bea , he can stay .
no .
baby , come on .
bea?
what?
you know , since i got back ...
since you got out .
yeah .
well , since i got here , you haven't said more than two words to me .
ray , what am i supposed to say?
my words don't seem to mean much to you anymore .
maybe they never did .
come on , bea , you ... you know i love you .
are you gonna stop then?
you know what , bea , what you don't understand is there's a lot of mean spirited people out there .
yeah .
ray?
you know , i had to bring junior home from school today
'cause of what the other kids were sayin '.
they got mean ass kids around here .
i think we should move to beverly hills .
no , no , ray , we're not gonna move .
'cause it ... it's not about where we live , ray .
it's about what you're doing to yourself .
and those boys worship you .
you want them to end up using that poison , too?
bea , that's not fair .
what's not fair?
what's not fair , ray?
that ... that's a low blow .
hello?
don't jive me , milt .
don't jive me , man !
really?
ah , good , good , good .
tell ... tell sam i said thank you .
all right .
all right , then .
oh , yeah !
what , ray?
what?
come on , now .
ray , tell me what happened .
abc got the case dropped .
the police didn't have a warrant .
they bought them off .
damn it , bea , do you want me to go to prison?
no .
ray , i want you to stop lying to yourself , and they are making that completely impossible .
you know what , you don't understand .
then make me understand , ray !
baby , when i walk out that door , i walk out alone in the dark !
i'm trying to do something that ain't nobody ever done in music and business .
but i can't do it if i'm alone everywhere i go .
i don't want to be alone here , bea .
not in my own home .
look , bea , if you don't understand me , then who will?
i don't know , ray .
david?
i'm coming !
mama's coming !
ray , we pull you out of the fire , and you want country music?
look here , i've been singing country music all my life .
as a matter of fact , i used to play with the florida playboys .
we made a big investment in you and it's paying off handsomely .
for both of us , i might add .
we don't want to lose your fan base .
yeah , you know , you got a point there , but i actually think that we have more to gain than we do to lose .
ray , it's a bad idea .
when i came to abc , you guys put in the contract that i can choose my own music .
you want to read that paragraph?
it's on page three .
i don't need to see it .
good evening , saint louis .
it's time for the main attraction .
the innovator of soul .
the genius himself .
ray charles !
## [ piano playing ]
go on , go on , ray !
thank you so much .
you know what , i know that a lot of y'all don't know that
i ...
i was brought up in the south .
you know , every time you turn on the radio there in the south , you hear the grand ole opry .
that's what i grew up singing , so i hope you don't mind ,
i ...
i want to sing something to give you a taste of my country roots .
unchain my heart !
georgia on my mind , ray !
# i can't stop loving you #

still working on the balcony .
okay , guys , we got 10 minutes to load out !
change back at the hotel .
they bought that country jive hook , line and sinker .
ray , man , you're amazing .
i'm gonna tell you something .
country music .
you know why they like it?
the stories , man .
they got great stories .
hey , joe .
ray , i want to introduce you to joe adams .
hal ziegler hired joe as the announcer for the rest of the tour .
i know you , mayor of melody .
i used to listen to your radio show in l. a. in the '50s .
we've both come a ways since then .
what was that counting you were doing back there?
i was cueing down the lights .
that shuts up the audience so you can sing your ballad instead of having to scream it .
hey , well , i'll be damned .
who told you to do that?
no one .
it just needed to be done .
see , that's what i'm talking about .
i like to hear a person say " it needed to be done " as opposed to a person saying , " it ain't my job .
you know , tell me about central avenue .
i know you know jack lauderdale .
hello , new york !
hello , boston !
hello , saint louis !

i don't know .

we should get our portraits painted , like rhett and scarlett .
bea , bring him in here .
ray , wait till you hear what's waiting in the living room .
what is it?
i had them build you a solid marble fireplace , two stories high .
hot damn !
how do you like it , bea?
it's awful big .
8, 500 square feet .
biggest house in the neighborhood .
so , does this meet with your approval?
man , this is a palace .
you think this is big?
wait until tomorrow when you see 30, 000 square feet of rpm incorporated .
yeah , headquarters !
this is it , ray .
your brand new recording studio .
did you get everything i asked for?
totally state of the art .
tom dowd built an eight track mixing console , two recorders , the works .
now , this room is bigger than most people's houses .
got your own private bathroom to your left .
right behind you is my adjoining office .
and step over to your private bar to your left .
got a bottle of bols right in the center .

what happened?
margie's dead .
oh , god !
h how?
she overdosed .
i didn't start her , bea .
i didn't let her do dope around me .
i ...
i just wouldn't let that happen .
yes , i'm sure , ray .
i'm sure you set a fine example .
what about her baby?
you knew?
his name is charles wayne .
he was born october 1 , in new york city .
he's 3 years old .
the baby's fine .
he's at her sister's .
all right .
i'll start sending them some money .
you don't have to .
i send them money every month .
in five minutes , mr. charles will be here , and he'll be ready to go .
now the charts jeff is handing out should be turned in at the conclusion of ...
you're late , that's a $50 fine .
i ain't late .
i give them a 10 minute grace period , joe .
2 : 05 .
he's late .
he'll be charged $50 .
what?
you know what?

then , fathead , you go on back to rehearsal .
ray .
ray , you know how it is , you've been there .
fathead , go on now .
let me handle this .
fathead , go on now .
you want to tell me what the hell is going on , ray?
i'm not doing anything i haven't been asked to .
ray's running a business .
he shouldn't have to waste time hearing why people were late .
i'm not talking to you , joe .
i'm talking to ray .
ray , now i know you think i'm soft on the band , but those cats would do whatever i ask .
but if you come in here with this , uh , " running a business " crap , you're gonna lose some good people .
i'm telling you , ray .
there are musicians waiting in line to play with ray charles .
not for long , once they get a taste of you .
ray , you're the leader , man .
be one !
come on , now .
you now what jeff , i mean things have changed .
it ain't like the days when it was seven of us on the chitlin 'circuit .
i mean , if you weren't busy building a bowling alley , you'd seen that .
so you know about that , huh?
i know about everything .
i'm just trying to figure out how you did it .
you think i'm stealing from you , ray?
if the shaw agency is gonna give you a cut of the 10 percent i'm given them .
i might as well keep the goddamn money in my pocket .
leave us alone .
we need to talk .
ray .
you can step outside , joe .
i'll be in my office .
ray , now i know that jealous bastard planted that lie in your head .
but i have never stolen from you , ray , and i never will .
i got a small business loan , and , yeah , milt shaw was giving me a little extra , but i'm not a thief , ray .
then what about that , jeff , huh?
a promoter swearing you did side deals with him so you could split my overages !
how could you do that to me?
we've been through so much , we be so like brothers .
you know what , ray?
if we were like brothers , why are you paying joe more than you're paying me?
damn all that !
you broke my heart , man .
well , you know what , ray?
you broke mine a long goddamn time ago !
well , then there it is .
you know something , ray?
you're going to get yours one day .
and i pray to god that he has mercy on your soul , you son of a bitch !
everything all right , ray?
how the hell do you think it is?
go tell him .
go tell him !
go , go tell him .
hey , dad .
hi , there .

okay .

the plane to montreal leaves at 11 : 00 .
i'll pick you up at 8 : 30 .
all right .
did you hear what ray junior said to you?
yeah .
do you know how much making the all star team means to him?
i know .
i got things on my mind .
we had to fire jeff .
what?
he was stealing .
jeff?
hmm .
i don't believe it .
yeah , well , we're better without him .
# my mother told me # [ audience clapping ]

we were alerted there might be drugs on this plane .
what?
that's outrageous !
i'm going to call our lawyer .
no lawyers at international checkpoints .
now , we're going to have to search everyone on this plane .
mr. charles , if you don't mind we'd like to start with you .
i'd like to see your overcoat .
i don't mind .
don't say anything , ray .
what's this?
ray , this isn't some judge in indiana .
it's federal .
they can charge you of smuggling which can mean real prison time .
our lawyers will do what they can , but ...
hello .
you can't hide out in here forever , ray .
look , it's my house .
i'm not in prison yet .
no , it's my house .
you ain't been here more than six days since we moved in .
no , ray , no !
a needle ain't gonna solve this !
get out of the way .
move !
only thing that can help you is god , ray .
don't think of god?
do you have any idea how it feels to go blind and still be afraid of the dark?
and every day , you stand pray for just a little light , and you get nothing .
'cause god don't listen to people like me .
stop talking like that .
as far as i'm concerned , me and god is even and i do what i please .
if goddamn it , if i want to shoot up , i shoot up .
then go ahead !
but you walk out that door and i'm doing something i should have done a long time ago .
i'm taking my boys and i'll leave .
you're not going away .
you ... you have no place to go .
no place?
no .
you think i'm scared of losing this?
ray , the only thing i was ever scared of losing was you .
because where was i ever gonna find another ray robinson?
so i put up with some terrible stuff .
maybe that makes me part to blame .
but i ain't scared no more .
you know i love you and those boys more than anything .
that is a damn lie and you know it !
you ever look at this?
really look at it , ray !
ray charles junior's " most valuable player .
he was so proud this day , until you came home too loaded to go to his banquet .
no !
no !
there is something you love more than me and them boys , more than all the women you ever slept with on the road , more than all the dope you ever took .
what are you talking about?
your music .
and if you don't stop using that needle , they're gonna take away your music and put you in jail .
is that poison worth losing everything?
mr. charles?
mr. charles .
you don't have to go through this .
we have a substitute that can help wean you off heroin .
i have to do it on my own .
i can do it .
i can do it .
ah .
don't touch me .
all right .
we'll do it your way .
doctor?
mr. charles .
mr. charles , i'm coming .
he's got no fluids left .
get an i. v. in him right away .
i'll insert the needle .
no needles .
yes .
it's very important .
you need this .
runner , i've got a runner !
whoa .
let me go .
let me go .
get him on the bed .
put those restraints on him .
no needles .
no , no .
oh .
george , i miss you .
i miss you , george .
i miss you .
oh .
okay .
uh oh .
you might be in trouble right there , doc .
hot damn , you whupped my ass again !
l i'll tell you what , i won't lose again the same way twice .
i spoke with the judge in boston , and he'll agree to probation .
he was impressed with your attorney's arguments , and he believes you deserve one more chance .
oh , that's great .
but you must complete our program and agree to take periodic drug tests .
you know what .
i'll do it .
i know people don't believe
i'm done with this dope , but i'm finished .
who's george?
ray , you've come through the worst of the physical reactions .
we should begin psychotherapy sessions .
uh , look , forget the head shrinking , doc .
i can handle this .
mr. charles , you're not the first celebrity junkie i've treated .
junkie?
what ...
nobody cons me at any price .
i'm not trying to do that .
if you want me to give that judge a positive report , you will have to earn it .
doc?
dr. hacker?
doc?
ray , come on , ray , play with me !
he ain't there .
talk to me , son .
i ain't no bad dream .
i'm a part of you .
even all that dope couldn't keep me away .
mama , i kept my promise .
you got strong all right .
went places i never dreamed of .
but you still became a cripple .
come here , baby .
come here .
ray?
it wasn't your fault .
now promise us you'll never let nobody or nothing turn you into no cripple ever again .
that you'll always stand on your own two feet .
promise .
today we're here to right a wrong that was done to one of our native sons nearly 20 years ago .
in 1961 ,
ray charles was banned from performing in the state of georgia because he refused to play before a segregated audience .
thankfully , we've come a long way since then .
some of us have fought for equality through the political process , but ray charles changed american culture by touching people's hearts .
so on this day , march 7 , 1979 , we , the duly elected representatives of the state of georgia not only proclaim georgia on my mind our official state song , we also offer mr. ray charles a public apology and welcome him back home .
# every time i sing this song #
if only your mama was here .
she's here .
she ain't never left .
# i sing for #
# georgia #
# whoa , georgia #
# the whole day through #
# just this old , sweet song #
# keeps georgia on my mind #
# georgia #
# oh , yeah #
# yeah , georgia #
# a song of you #
# comes as sweet and clear #
# as moonlight through the pines #
# i feel that #
# other arms #
# reach out to me #
# other eyes #
# smile # # tenderly #
# well , all right now #
# yeah #
# don't you know? #
# still in peaceful dreams #
# i see a busy road #
# the road leads back to you #

# i say , oh , i say #

# every time i call you on the phone #
# some fella tells me that you're not at home #
# so unchain my heart , oh please , please set me free #
# i'm under your spell #
# i'm under your spell #
# like a man in a trance #
# like a man in a trance #
# but i know darn well #
# i know darn well # # that i don't stand a chance #
# i don't stand a chance #
# so , unchain my heart #
# unchain my heart #
# let me go my way #
# unchain my heart #
# unchain my heart #
# unchain my heart #
# you worry me night and day #
# unchain my heart #
# why lead me through a life of misery #
# when you don't care a bag of beans for me #
# so unchain my heart , please , please set me free #
# please set me free #
# oh , won't you set me free #
# please set me free #
# whoa , set me free #
# please set me free #
# wow , set me free ##
