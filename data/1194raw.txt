green and i have an appointment at composure , the fastest growing women's magazine in the country .

pay him .
oh , man .
well , you were right .
delauer diamonds is looking for a new ad agency .
warren wants to move on it aggressively .
yes !
oh , oh , this is a good day , this is a good day .
guys , did you know that diamonds are about as common as taxis on fifth avenue?
the value is entirely sentimental , maintained by a supply , demand and advertising .
stripes .
now , delauer dominates the world diamond market .
meaning if i represent them ,
i basically represent the entire industry .
tell him .
what?
warren gave it to the judys .
spears and green they're already on it .
no way !
yeah , well , you know , he's kind of partial to hot , leggy chicks for some reason .
yeah , and we're the , you know , the sneakers and beer division .
precious gems aren't exactly our forte .
lips and hips are over at a chick's magazine right now .
i got to get to warren before they sink ...
you can't , you can't .
he's on a plane .
easy , pal .
the chicago meeting .
and it's too late anyway , because warren's meeting them for drinks at mullins 'tonight to discuss their ideas .
you know what?
this isn't happening .
you know why?
this was my tip .
it's going to be my pitch , my account , my campaign .
this is my baby .
that's what i'm talking about .
they will not ace me out of this .
that's right .
i heard that .
okay .
mullins ', tonight .
i heard that "?
oh .
hi .
hi .
l i don't really want to talk about it , okay?
okay .
okay .
okay .
why does this always happen to me?
things were going great for , like , a week and a half , and then , all of a sudden , it's over , and i am mystified .
seriously , i am mystified , because it always starts out so well .
poor baby .
let's just roll with this one .
oh , mike and i had such a connection .
the first time that we had sex , ... it was so beautiful ...
i cried .
you cried?
yeah .
you mean , like , one glistening tear on your cheek , right?
no .
i was really emotional .
i even told him that i loved him .
after how many days?
five .
two .
it was how i felt .
i wanted to express myself .
okay , well , what did he say?
oh , mike didn't have to say anything .
i know that he felt the same .
but then he started getting really busy , and i didn't know where he was .
so i kept calling him and calling him .
he was never home ...
you kept calling him?
i didn't leave a message .
he didn't know it was me .
my number's blocked .
oh , l i'm sure he thought it was one of his friends .
you know , men frequently call their friends 'answering machines and hang up 20 times .
anyway ...
i'm too fat .
you're not fat !
you're not fat !
oh , michelle , if the most beautiful woman in the world acted the way you did , any normal guy would still go running in the other direction .
oh , no .
no guy would go running from you , andie .
you could barf all over him , and he would say , " do it again .
that is both incredibly disgusting and categorically untrue .
lf i did the things you did , i'd get dumped , too .
okay , family , shoes off .
and breathe .
out .
okay , lori , let's start with you .
well , the " botox for beginners " piece is done .
now , it's a little scary , but mostly upbeat .
now i'm on
what your gyno won't tell you , " which is also pretty scary , but , you know , upbeat .
i finished my research on deadly pedicures , about the woman who contracted that fungus from the unsterilized tools .
yeah .
it's a terrible story .
although , surprisingly ... upbeat !
marvelous .
what's next for " 'how to 'with andie "?
well , i've been working on something that's kind of different .
it's ...
it's a political piece , and it's ...
no .
andie , you work at composure magazine .
we are fashion , trends , diets , cosmetic surgeries , salacious gossip that's composure .
okay , but ...
look ,
andie , okay the column is new for you .
when you turn it into a must read , then you can write about whatever you want .
until then , you can write about whatever i want .
understood?
yeah .
michelle , what have you got?
i'm sorry , lana ,
i wasn't feeling very well ...
she got dumped .
oh , no ,
michelle ...
what a hellish ordeal for you .
but i must say , you are looking fabulous .
are we loving the way she looks , all?
we love the way she looks .
oh , you are so right .
she looks great .
well , i haven't eaten since the split .
good for you !
write about it .
i can't use my personal life for a story .
i understand completely .
who will use michelle's personal life for a story?
oh , i will .
go .
no , no , no ,
lana , with all due respect ,
lori has no business mucking around in my personal life , and i can't ...
i can't let her .
i am ...
i'll do it .
what?
i'll ...
i will ...
i'll sort of do it .
it's ...
you will be my inspiration .
for?
look at michelle .
she is a great girl , right?
yes .
an amazing woman .
but she has a problem hanging onto relationships , and doesn't really know what she's doing wrong , which is like a lot of our readers .
uh huh .
so , i was thinking that i could start by dating a guy , and then drive him away , but only using the classic mistakes most women , like michelle , make ... all the time .
i'll keep a diary of it , and it will be sort of a ... dating " how to " in reverse .
what not to do .
yeah .
how to lose a guy in ten days .
yes .
go .
bart , what's new in the shoe world?
wait , wait , lana , i'm sorry .
why ten days?
five days is too short , and we go to press in 1 1 .
yes?
okay , what we found out is men are attracted to purple shoes .
now , i love ...
maybe toss in something spiritual as well .
who's that chic buddhist richard gere cavorts with?
the dalai lama .
he's fabulous .
ah !
here's my 10 : 00 .
welcome .
hi .
ladies , judy spears and judy green from warren advertising .
we're going to cook up some fabulous tie ins for the fall .
jeannie ashcroft , fashion and trends .
michelle rubin , fitness and health .
excuse me .
hi .
and andie anderson , our resident " how to " girl .
oh , i've seen your column , andie .
what are you working on now?
oh , actually ...
how to lose a guy in ten days .
she's actually going to start dating a guy , and then drive him away in a week and a half .
sounds needlessly vicious .
it's going to be fabulous .
now all she has to do is run along and find the lucky guy .
go , go , go .
nice to meet you .
bye .
good bye .
ladies , come .
find the guy .
okay .
find the guy .
oh , you are never going to pull this off .
watch me .
tonight , i'll hook a guy .
tomorrow , pull the switch .
before the ten days are up ,
i'm going to have this guy running for his life .
you're not going to burn his apartment down or bite him or anything , are you?
no !
i'm going to limit myself to doing everything girls do wrong in relationships .
basically , everything we know guys hate .
i'll be clingy , needy ...
yeah .
be touchy feely .
ooh , call him in the middle of the night , and tell him everything you had to eat that day .
what's wrong with that?
i'm kidding .
hello , ben .
what are you doing here?
phil , i'm here for the meeting .
ladies .
but you weren't invited .
yeah , but i should have been .
i mean , it was my tip that delauer's shopping for a new firm .
yes , it was , but i have to think in terms of who's best suited within the company team .
yes , sir , and that's me .
i want to handle this pitch .
ben , you sell joe blow better than anyone else in my shop , but these girls sell luxury better than anyone else in the business .
we have to put our best foot forward on this pitch .
delauer would be our biggest account .
yes , sir , they would .
annual advertising billings of 50 to $60 million .
and i am the man that's going to bring this home for you , phil .
why this place?
it's perfect .
hi , lngrid .
hi .
mullins 'is the apres work watering hole for the upwardly mobile .
now , to date , the diamond industry has always targeted men , sending the message that the woman needs the man to buy her the rock .
all right , they say , " a diamond is forever .
we say , " a diamond is for everyone .
i like that .
yes .
we don't .
a diamond is for everyone " sends the message that diamonds are everywhere , which means they're not rare , and if they're not rare , they lose their status .
status is the reason to buy them in the first place , which benjamin would know if he understood women , which you don't .
you can't feel bad about that , ben .
no man does .
here you go .
thank you .
thanks .
oh !
sorry .
here .
here .
thanks .
dum , dum , dum , dum , dum , dum , dum ...
hey , don't pressure her .
she's perusing .
yes , exactly .
hmm .
hmm .
selling a diamond to a woman is like making her fall in love .
she has to feel giddy , desirous , adventurous , and desperate .
take a look around this room , phillip .
most of the women in this bar are looking for just that .
exactly .
the skills required to market diamonds are the same as those needed to make a woman fall in love , yes .
i'm not talking about lust .
a woman in lust wants chocolate .
a woman in love ... wants diamonds .
yeah , i'm not talking about lust , either , ladies .
i'm talking about deep , meaningful , head over heels , his and her towels ,
let's grow old together , l o v e.
look , i love women .
i do .
whether they're four , 40 , or my 88 year old grandmother ,
i respect women , all right?
and i also listen ... to women , and that's why i can sell myself to any woman , anywhere , anytime .
make a woman fall in love with diamonds , benjamin ... or with you?
eh , either one .
well , that's cocky , ben .
no , not cocky confident .
i'd like to see you prove that .
you would?
the agency's cohosting a party for the delauers at the astor museum .
the party's a week from sunday .
do you think you could make a woman fall in love with you by then?
ten days?
any woman , anywhere , anytime?
any single , available , straight woman yes .
yes .
i'm not trying to trick you , ben .
ln fact , we'll choose a woman right here , right now , in this bar , and then you decide .
ooh .
so , who's the lucky girl?
okay ...
let's see here .
ooh , there's that blonde babe in the leopard print .
whoa , ho , ho !
she looks like fun .
be nice , ladies .
or ... wow ,
miss babylon five .
now , she's on the prowl .
no .
her .
her who?
her , in the gray dress .
blonde hair .
pretty smile .
her?
done .
what?
done .
done .
see the guy next to the horrible guy in the green shirt that i would never even consider?
okay?
hmm !
very cute .
right?
good .
all right?
here i go !
okay , you're on .
but here are the stakes .
after i win this bet , this pitch is mine .
agreed .
phil?
agreed .
you come to that party with a girl that's really in love with you , ben ... you can make the pitch to the delauers .
but , phillip , you can't ...
i've made up my mind .
to the delauers .
to the delauers .
cheers .
cheers .
cheers .
mm mm .
mm mm .
i was just wondering if you find ... ... exciting?
yes .
my wife and i love new york , especially this time of year .

good night , andie anderson .
oh , you are already falling in love with me .
i'm going to make you wish you were dead .
poor guy .
of all the women spears and green could have thrown at me , this one is amazing .
hanging with her for ten days is going to be no problem .
right , so , it's only nine days longer than you've ever spent with any other chick , huh?
that's why i didn't go for the gold immediately .
oh .
i'm taking my time .
it's a marathon , not a sprint .
ten days is a marathon?
okay , so it's more like the 3, 000 meter hurdle .
the point is , she's already on the ropes , guys .
wow , that that's a lot of sports analogies .
that it?
that that's it?
that's it .
have you looked inside?
no .
do you have an ethical problem with rifling through a woman's purse?
uh , yeah , i guess i do .
well , it's hardly a purse , dude .
it's more like a clutch or something .
guys , a woman's purse , all right it's her secret source of power .
all right?
there there are many dark and dangerous things in there that we , the male species , should know nothing about .
oh .
unless , of course , she , uh , left it behind intentionally to secure a next day call back .
mm hmm .
she's a very clever minx .
oops , i'm sorry .
oh , god .
um ...
oh , shit , we got to clean that up .
yeah , yeah .
carefully .
carefully .
oh , what have we here?
let us see , let us see .
oh ...
knicks tickets ...
huh . ... for tonight's game .
delivery , andie .
wow , look at those !
oh , who are those for?
andie , oh , my god !
where do you want these?
who are these to?
wait .
100 times ...
... more beautiful ...
wait . " ... than 100 roses .
catchy .
the guy's in advertising .
he can't help it .
so , does this mean he's hooked?
this means he found the knicks tickets .
you left the tickets in the purse?
yeah .
you are just on a whole different playing field .
here you go .
mm hmm .
andie anderson .
hey , hey , pretty girl .
guess what?
i got a really embarrassing display of white roses .
well , you are welcome .
listen , i had a wonderful time last night .
i have your bag .
ah , i know .
i can't believe i left it there .
yeah , well , you must need it back , what with all the cash , credit cards , and ... those knicks tickets for tonight's game .
sounds like you've been peeking through my bag , ben .
oh , absolutely not .
tony , my art director , he's an oaf , and he accidentally knocked it over .
ow , right !
yeah , i'm a clumsy man .
all right , i'm sorry , though .
i'm going to the game with somebody else .
not anymore .
besides , what?
you think you left your purse at my place by accident?
no .
subconsciously , you are dying to take me to that game .
denying your subconscious desires is extremely dangerous to your health , young lady .
does that psycho babble really work on anybody?
you tell me .
andie , you're so bad .
all right , meet me at the 7th avenue entrance .
7 : 30 .
don't be late .
