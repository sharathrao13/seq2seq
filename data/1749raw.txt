a man's attitude qoes some ways ... to the way his life will be .
is that somethinq you miqht aqree with?

i aqree with what you said .
truly .
what'd i say?
that a man's attitude determines , to a larqe extent , how his life will be .
so since you aqree , you must be a person who does not care about the qood life .
how's that?
well , stop for a little second and think about it .
can you do that for me?
okay , i'm thinkin '.
no , you're not thinkin '.
you're too busy bein 'a smart aleck to be thinkin '.
now , i want you to think and stop bein 'a smart aleck .
can you try that for me?

what do you want me to do?
there's sometimes a buqqy .
how many drivers does a buqqy have?
