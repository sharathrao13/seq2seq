who the fuck is this?
the man for whom christophe arranged to have the black stones ... ... brought into the country and deposited at the jewelry exchange .
the man who wants them back .
now .
all right , well , how much?
maybe you didn't understand me .
the stones are already mine .
yo , check this out?
i got them , i'm selling them , put the money on the wood !
i don't have time for this .
that's your last offer?
i can be a very dangerous man , mr. fait .
i don't get it .
do i look like the salvation army?
i bust my ass all night and got nothing to show for it .
you know what , dog?
it don't even matter who the fuck you are .
i ain't got nothing for you .
shit !
shit !
give us the stones .
how many times i got to tell you people?
i'm a businessman .

tell us where they are .
come on !
the car !
what is it with these fucking stones?
yeah .
it's archie .
bad news .
we got a problem .
i put word out on the street to get some info on the stones .
next thing i know , the wu tang clan shows up here .
three important elements here .
one , i'm outmanned ... ... two , they're heavily armed , and three , they're about to pound me .
i can't watch anymore .
i got a few licks in ...
let's see the rest .
did you see my new dvd players?
<i>all right !
okay ! </ i>
<i> give me that ! </ i>
<i> i forgot i had them .
sorry ! </ i>
i could've resisted more .
but they could've beat me into a coma or killed me .
how could i tell you where the stones are if i'm dead or on life support?
so i threw in the towel , reluctantly , for your sake .
okay , so you saved yourself to tell me something .
so tell me .
what?
who was it?
i don't know .
what did they say?
give me the stones , you fat cracker motherfucker .
that sort of thing .
that's it?
that's pretty bad .
cracker is kind of racist .
thanks for keeping yourself alive long enough to tell me nothing !
did you call the police?
did i call the police?
look around here , are you crazy?
only question now is , who's behind this jack move?
i don't know , but they got some great guns i can't even get .
u. s. special forces only .
chambers .
jump chambers?
i hope not .
hey , who's jump chambers?
this guy's in on everything that goes down in town .
the only one i know that can get those weapons .
and he has a fucking army .
you're on your own , i don't need the headache .
and since i'm totally fucked , who are you?
yeah , you got an id?
buddy?
picture , preferably?
yeah , all right .
this means nothing to me .
let me see it .
it's taiwan , central security bureau .
taiwanese intelligence .
read chinese?
no , but i know " cop " in every language .
what are you?
some kind of kung fu james bond?
the stones belong to taiwan .
they belong to chambers now .
i'm starting to hate this fucking phone .
i'll get you a new one .
yeah .
i hope you've reconsidered .
oh , it's bad ass !
what's up , homes?
you've made this difficult , mr. fait .
let me make it easy .
i can't wait to hear this .
daddy , daddy , daddy !
she's very pretty in her pink pajamas , aren't you , vanessa?
son of a ...
<i> i want my stones , mr. fait</ i> .
let me talk to the chinese gentleman .
don't you fucking touch her !
the chinese gentleman , please .
he has my daughter .
he wants to talk to you .
jesus , tony .
what happened?
what did you just do?
i said i have the stones , and i won't negotiate for your daughter .
what?
that's stupid .
it will confuse him , buy us time , keep her alive .
what the hell are you talking about?
this motherfucker has my baby !
look , i know him .
i want the stones , you want your daughter .
we can help each other .
so i'm stuck with you .
get in .
we gotta see chambers .
find a place to put her .
my daddy's gonna come and kick your butts !
su says he has the stones .
but why cut me off?
why not negotiate for the girl?
doesn't make any sense .
buyers fly in tomorrow .
should we stop them?
we'll never regain their confidence .
we need information .
find the right people , pay whatever it costs .
something's not right .
something's happening with the stones .
what about the girl?
we'll need her .
she stays alive ... ... for now .
yeah , i'm on my way to see chambers now .
no , i don't have a choice .
get in touch with his people , let him know i need to see him .
i'll call you back .
i'm sorry about your daughter .
how old is she?
mind your business .
she's 8 .
she'll be 9 in september .
mine is 15 .
boyfriends?
never .
i'd kill them .
you wish .
about time you pmd .
pmd?
yeah , put me down .
what's this all about?
the stones are not what you think they are .
no shit .
what about this guy who has vanessa?
he's exactly what you think he is .
a thief and a killer .
great .
fucking great .
i want my daddy !
keys .
where'd you get this piece of shit?
let's just say grandma and grandpa have a long walk back from the campground .
you sure you cleaned it out?
it's clean , all right .
shut up !
you shut up !
go to sleep !
<i>angels east , angels west ... </ i> ... north and south , just do your best ... ... to guard her and watch her while she rests .

yeah , she always was good .
from the moment i saw her to the moment you took her away from me .
problem?
the black stones .
that bitch brought in too .
i made a lot of money with her , but that's all stopped now .
you stopped that .
you decided it was okay to put an end to that .
black stones , what?
i need them back .
the only smart thing you did was not pimping her yourself .
see , because then i'd have been real heated and you'd have been real dead .
but you don't pimp , right?
you're just a thief in the night , stealing shit that don't belong to you .
hey .
what?
he don't talk?
i don't speak korean .
yeah , well , i do .
bought me a little korean spot downtown .
bringing in the soul brothers 24 7 , 365 .
black man gouging koreans .
ain't that a switch , chick?
them motherfuckers got faces like walls , but they love to drink and look at naked girls .
place ain't no shitbox .
you should see my office .
got that shit decked out like a kabuki love palace .
you know what that is , right?
why don't you roll by sometime?
check out the poon .
my little girl is mixed up in this .
if i don't get those stones back , she's dead .
what do you want , man?
i mean ...
i'm begging .
you know , i was thinking .
that was a big heist .
risky heist .
what would make a man go through that kind of trouble , take that kind of heat?
gotta be something good .
something valuable .
jump ... ... it's my little girl .
make another one .
you mother ...
drama .
i see the slope's no dope .
got a lot of offspring running around , brother .
big score is once in a lifetime .

don't forget your fucking shoes .
pussy .
i used to really look up to that guy .
used to want to be just like him .
in taiwan , i can make him talk .
yeah , well , this ain't taiwan .
only thing we can do now is try to find out where the stones are and get them .
you make it sound easy .
it won't be .
what?
they're at his club .
how do you know?
i know .
i can just feel it .
it's never happened to you?
no .
thought you chinese were all mystical .
we like to gamble .
not guess .
it's no guess , but i could be wrong .
i'll hit the club , you go see archie .
why?
he has to remember something .
what if he can't?
pretend it's taiwan .
make him remember .
hey .

with a capital t.
tony fait?
thought you two were tight .
bonnie and clyde .
yeah , it used to be that way .
not taking care of me these days .
kid's all he cares about .
it's a shame , huh?
so , what you want me to do?
i don't know .
probably nothing you can do .
i just thought ... ... you know .

i shouldn't be in here .
sorry .
no , hold up , hold up .
girls .

champagne?

i need something .
how about you work here?
how would jump feel about me coming back and all?
you let me worry about jump chambers .
in the meantime ... ... how about we go to my office and we talk about this a little bit more?
it's not exactly boxing matches , it's a lot more dangerous .
no gloves or nothing , no rules , period .
it's huge money .
it's very illegal .
they hold it during the day to fool cops .
the man you remember , how do you know he'll be here?
i don't , but this is chambers 'operation , so it's a damn good place to start .
here we are .
this is a private club .
you can't come in .
it's me , archie .
everybody likes me here .
hey , it's that asshole archie again .
how can you recognize him?
well , i didn't see his face , but they all kind of look the same .
of course so do you guys .
no offense .
but i will remember that pinky ring because it was awesome .
he's got , like , a 10 carat , round cut , square setting , good color and clarity .
i remember thinking about the damage it'd do to my face if he hit me .
i gotta make sure mr. pinky ring doesn't recognize me , so i got a disguise .
how do we get in?
leave it to me .
i'll take care of it .
hey , buddy .
how you doing?
how's that armor plated lincoln i sold you?
cops stopped me .

fucking warm up .
a bitch gotta be ready to come off the bench and score some points .
just take the rock to the motherfucking hoop strong .
you dig?
instead of doing this back and forth shit , my idea is you come up with a number .
a very high number .
you see , i'm throwing a number so high ... ... that when i hear it just ...
it just gets me off .
and then , bam !
bust a nut , roll over , go to sleep .

yeah , i like that .
oh , shit !
hey , hey , hey , hey !

okay , okay , okay !
<i>and it looks like this parking garage is where</ i> <i>it will end .
as police have sealed ... </ i> <i> ... the building and continue</ i> <i>their search inside for the man who ... </ i> <i> ... led them on what certainly had to</ i> <i>be the most extreme chase we've ever seen . </ i>
<i> don't know why these idiots do it , barbara . </ i>
<i> they never get away , do they? </ i>
<i>they sure don't , and they just endanger</ i> <i>innocent citizens in the process . </ i>
<i>here's another car exiting the structure . </ i>
<i>police talking to the driver, </ i> <i>inspecting the vehicle . </ i>
<i>well , the police know they have him</ i> <i>trapped inside the parking structure . </ i>
<i>knowing cops the way i do , i can tell you</ i> <i>they're good and po'd , excuse my language . </ i>
<i>and they're not about to let this guy</ i> <i>slip through their fingers . </ i>
mr. chambers is resting .
he says not to bother him .
<i>hey , baby . </ i>
<i>please don't go . </ i>
<i>you want me to stay? </ i>
<i>yeah , i need someone to stay here</ i> <i>and help keep me awake . </ i>
<i>wait a minute . </ i>
<i>i know that face . </ i>
<i>a lot of men had that look on their face</ i> <i>when i got married . </ i>
i knew the stones were in there .
he was a tough guy at first , but when i got close to his nuts he sang like cline dion .
how we gonna get them out of there?
that place is always jumping .
yo , dog , something's not right .
i got the same feeling .
the doorman .
where is he?
everybody stay put .
sorry .
watch my nuts , all right?
no chambers 'guys .
something's wrong .
this guy looks better dead .
he said they were here in the fountain .
where are they?
this can't be fucking happening .
they have to be here !
that's it?
one stone?
ling .
he has the rest .
how the fuck do you know?
i know .
okay .
he has the stones .
i mean , she can't hurt him .
she's just a little girl .
she's only 8 years old .
he'll let her go , right?
he'll just fucking let her go !
what am i gonna do?
we have to go .
now .
we're back in business .
good .
we don't have to babysit much longer .
i hate kids .

it's called the dimaster oscillator .
not test .
calibrate .
which i'm now ready to do .
goggles?

thanks .
please work .
please work .
please work .

<i>daddy , please , come and get me ... </ i> ... i wanna go home !

<i>i don't know ! </ i>
i'm in a van inside a big building .
<i>they painted the windows . </ i>
<i>i can't look out ! </ i>

<i> i'm scared ! </ i>

<i>i don't know .
i can't see anything . </ i>
you gotta try , sweetheart .
try to see something .
i'm going .
i'm trying .
i see chairs and green light .
chairs .
green light .
where's the light coming from?
i can't tell .
there's a machine .
it's like a laser show .
laser show?
<i> daddy ... </ i> ... hurry !
i'm scared !
<i> i wanna go home ! </ i>
okay , baby .
calm down .
<i>it's gonna be okay . </ i>
daddy's coming !
daddy?
vanessa?
<i> daddy ! </ i>
<i>vanessa? </ i>
vanessa !
great !
shit !
he's doing it here tonight .
doing what?
selling the stones .
the thai laser emits green light .
he needs it to enrich them .
to show their power .
what the hell are you talking about?
what are these stones?
a new form of synthetic plutonium .
small and portable , but mega powerful .
am i right?
there's a bunch of international scumbags who'd pay a lot of money ... ... to get their hands on those .
and then , look out world .
enough of this shit !
how's it gonna get me back my daughter?
we're operational .
the buyers will want to arrive and leave quickly .
somewhere private , accessible by aircraft .
vanessa did say she was inside of a big building .
could be a hangar .
there's about a dozen little airports around here , man .
we ain't gonna never get them all .
flight plans .
yeah , flight plans .
they gotta list a destination .
every aircraft that takes off ... ... has to file one with the aviation administration or risk getting shot down ... ... by the u. s. military .
so you get that list ... ... and maybe we can find out where the sale's going down .
daria , call the aviation people .
use our l. a. p. d. credentials .
we need flight info on all aircrafts coming in or going out .
miles , the no gun policy is no longer in effect .
break out the heat .
everybody else , get ready to move .
tommy , create a diversion .
i got just the thing if we can fit in it .
wick airfield .
five private choppers arriving tonight within minutes of each other .
sounds like our best bet .
better be for vanessa s sake .
let's go .
you are the world's foremost arms dealers .
you all know that weaponry equals power , and in the world of weaponry ... ... nukes rule .
but nuclear material is hard to obtain and difficult to handle .
but what if it weren't?
that's the question that brought you here tonight .
and this is the answer .
a unique , man made element .
in its present state it's completely inert .
zero radiation ...
... zero volatility .
one small fragment easily transformed into a source of immense energy .
more powerful than weapons grade plutonium 100 times its size .
goggles on .
<i>so , what the hell does taiwan</ i> <i>gotta do with this? </ i>
<i>we developed the stones . </ i>
<i>they belong to us . </ i>
<i>okay , what about the guy you're after? </ i>
<i>how come you know him so well? </ i>
<i>we grew up together . </ i>
<i>we joined the government at the same time . </ i>
<i>wait a minute .
wait a minute . </ i>
<i>you were on the same side? </ i>
<i>he betrayed us .
he killed our team . </ i>
<i>he tried to kill me too . </ i>
<i>if you don't take this</ i> <i>motherfucker out , i will . </ i>
<i>the stones first , then him . </ i>
creating a highly reactive radioactive isotope ... ... requires altering the atomic structure of the original material .
normally this is accomplished by adding neutrons .
here , we're using electromagnetic distillation to strip away protons .
in the process , the fragment's potential yield is increasing exponentially .
we're now reaching the yield level of a sidewinder missile .
enough power to take out a tank .
a tomahawk cruise missile , enough to destroy a building .
scud .
that's a few city blocks gone .
hiroshima .
two hiroshimas .
new world order .
the purpose of today's sale is to begin trading ... ... a new commodity on the black market and to determine its value .
