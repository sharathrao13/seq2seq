china , ming dynasty
the year is 1457 a. d.
at that time , the eunuchs had special privileges and power
they had control over two groups
the east factory guards and the brocade imperial guards
these are the fan tze
fan tze are secret agents
these fan tze and brocade guards are stone hearted and vicious
if the peasants heard them approaching
they would be frightened to death
he is their second boss , mao tong chin
he is their first boss , li shao dang
these guys are good at fighting , and do the evil work .
the head of these people is a man called tzao shao chin
not only is he in charge , he is also a swords expert
his fighting ability is extraordinary
the official are all afraid to see tzao shao chin
today he is the prosecutor
the one who is being executed

the manager of this place , manager wu , is my friend
where do you make your living?

so you come here on a case
i don't have a choice , i have to make a living
later on , i may even need your assistance
you are too kind

brother hsiao , not to be offensive

this time , we are on a secret mission
the authorities command that there should be no bystanders

i remember , under the moon
i remember , before the flowers
so much of the past lingers in my heart
half is bitter half is sweet
year after year , i can't let go
can't let go , can't let go
under the moon , before the flowers
can't let go , can't let go
i'll remember with longing forever
i remember , under the moon
i remember , before the flowers
so much of the past lingers in my heart
half is bitter half is sweet
year after year , i can't let go
an oldie from the 60's can't let go
