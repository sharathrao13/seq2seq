wednesday's are " south of the border " days .
we'ii be serving a spicy tuna tamale along with a three cheese quesadilla .
sounds iike it's going to be another ... hot year in the kitchen .
hello?
yes?
what is it?
sir , it's time for morning announcements .
yes , i i'm aware of that .
yes .
um ... why don't you make the announcements this morning , dear?
but what should i announce?
tell her about the quesadillas .
make something up !
okay .
well , that was a mood breaker .
you know , honey ...
i think i've finally figured out a way to bilk this school out of enough money to get us that condo in waikiki .
how , sweet baby?
you've done it all .
small potatoes .
this is the big one .
this is visionary .
this idea is genius .
look at this .
the richard moffitt special needs grant .
this moffitt guy used to be in a special needs program , and then he iearns to string a couple of sentences together and now he's some big hotshot .
anyway , the state is giving 100 grand in his name to every school that has a special needs class .
this is fantastic !
mm hmm .
aii we have to do is kill this moffitt guy and we get all the money .
no , no .
what we need is to set up a fake special needs class .
we start our own class .
problem is , where do we find kids ... we can pass off as special?
okay , that's high enough !
thanks , turk .
i'm flying !
woo hoo !
so this is what a flag sees all day .
yeah .
and your friend turk is totally great .
yeah , he's aces , huh?
hey , thanks , turk !
we're so high !
bingo .
welcome to special needs orientation .
i'm ms. heller , the iunch iady .
and it damn .
i mean , your new teacher .
yeah .
now the reason you two are here before class officially starts is because you're ... extra special .
thank you .
and were personally selected by principal collins .
who's principal collins?
he's the principal .
wow .
your first assignment is to pick the rest of the class .
hey !
find students that are just as special as you two .
special .
what?
is is this gonna be on the midterm?
no .
you know , you're the first person i ever brought here , harry .
is this your special place?
no , i just usually eat in the crapper .
yeah , saves time .
out with the old , in with the new .
could we eat there tomorrow?
yeah , but first we need to find kids that are special , needy , and classy enough to be in our special needs class .
it'ii be iike taking candy from a stranger .
" har ery "?
the second " r " is silent .
oh , that makes much more sense .
oh , iittle crippled boy .

his curse is our blessing .

the cast comes off in a few weeks .
he's obviously in denial .
maybe we can help .
we're part of a special class taught by the iunch iady .
i mean , ms. heller .
you should join up .
it doesn't require any walking .
no one will make fun of your horrible deformity .
how much homework is there?
that's the downside .
there's none .
dude , dude .
wait a minute , i can spend the whole year in a class taught by the iunch iady?
yeah .
can i bring my girlfriend?
you can bring whatever you want .
aii right .

you're way out of your ieague .
jessica !
harry , lloyd .
you guys are a mess .

so it iooks iike the best man won .
why didn't you tell us your boyfriend was principal collins?

harry , lloyd ,
iisten to me , i only have time to say this once .
god , she's so cute .
look at her teeth .
i bet she can bite through anything .
yeah , she could .
you gotta get what's in the chest , and make sure everybody ...
i wonder what lloyd's thinking about .

so guys , are you iistening to me?
yeah , sure !
yeah , yeah .
i was , you know  yeah , sure .
i'm a pisces .
and that's the sign of the badger .

i can get out of this anytime i want .
and i'm getting the story every high school reporter dreams of .
come on , jessica .
don't push me , 'cause i'm ...
go , get out of here .
gotcha , you  stop !
what?
i don't think this is the right thing to do .
harry , we don't even know what's in there .
you're overreacting .
i don't know who we are anymore .
you're right .
but i feel iike i deserve much more of this treasure
'cause i was the one that found it .
my mom gave me the map .
but i iugged it all over town .
i made the polar bear pants .
i ate your mom's pie !
i found that rock !
it was a diamond , and you swallowed it .
we were all out of top hats .
enough !
what has this cursed chest done to us?
you know , lloyd , the real treasure is our friendship .
yeah , you're right .
on the other hand ...
oh .
what's all this?
oh ... it's full of files .
there's pictures and documents .
it's amazing !
ohhh .
hey , lloyd , this iooks iike one of your mix tapes .
maybe it's from the pirate who buried this treasure .
you should go put it on .
principal's log , september 23rd .
check , check , check .
sound check .
hey , it's principal collins .
that makes total sense .
i found the treasure chest in his office . ... grant money ...
this mix tape isn't as good as yours .
no .
sound , check , check , check .
he speaks pretty good chinese .
that's not chinese .
that's chinese .
yeah .
oh yeah .
and that is how i , principal collins , became the mastermind behind this glorious plan .
it's the crime of the century .
he's right .
we have committed the crime of the century .
we never thanked him for giving us the special needs class !
but what do we do?
i have an idea .
welcome to the providence hills high school
thanksgiving parade !
aren't you glad you're not watching football?
this year's theme , white meat or dark?
floats and exhibits from all classes and organizations .
so enjoy .
what the hell is that?
what did you morons do?
where's george washington?
what do we do with this?
looks great , doesn't he?
no .
what were you guys thinking?
why'd you give him a makeover?
sorry i'm iate .
woke up tied to the bed .
somebody cut my hair while i was sleeping .
hey , that's my hair !
it's the marching band's musical tribute to stuffing .
please do not throw cigarettes at the floats .
i've searched everywhere and no iuck .
the chest is still out there .
that's why we get the check as soon as zimmer shows up and blow this pop stand before anybody finds out anything .
the band sounds terrible .
i know , i sold all the wind instruments .
hawaiian air , business class .
you iike your new coat?
i love it .
that's why our mascot isn't a stallion anymore .
this is horse?
no , no , no , i sold the horse ,
to pay for the  i didn't know horse could feel this soft .
that's not horse , honey .
yes , yes , it is soft .
so what do you think of the float?
guys , this is much better .
yeah .
principal collins is a way greater american than george washington will ever be .
i don't get it .
why'd you make him a pirate?
i'ii tell you why .
you won't believe these documents .
they provide evidence of a iong history of fraud and embezzlement from the school by principal collins and ms. heller ,
a. k. a. the iunch iady .
huh?
my god , can you believe your ears?
yeah , no clicks and whistles .
she speaks the english perfectly .
lloyd , you're a great teacher .
ching chong , what happened to your beautiful asian accent?
oh , actually my name is cindy .
the accent just helps me meet boys .
you want it back?
you got it , joe .
look at this .
collins took $2000 that was supposed to go to a new state of the art stallion mascot uniform .
wait , what?
let me see .
why have i been wearing this one with puke in the head?
you serious?
am i smell .
we got to tell people about collins .
hey , superintendent .
i'm not sure i can do this .
we got to nail this guy .
you'ii be fine .
just make sure he takes that check .
detective , you know , he's gonna be expecting moffitt to be ... special .
don't worry about it .
i studied acting at the police academy .
police academy?
you'ii be fine .
just remember your lines .
it's show time .
principal collins .
superintendent zimmer .
hello .
hello , hello .

your iittle gift for the school?
yes .
i drew this .
special needs .
time for french fries now .
oh , yes .
but the check will be presented this morning?
i'm very strong .
yes , you are .
i have your check right here .
but i think mr. moffitt is interested in seeing the special needs float first .
i can turn on all the faucets in my house .
even the hose .
but we don't drink from the hose , do we?
no .
there's the special needs float .
oh , here they come !
wait till you see what the children have done .
yes .
this is visionary .
i think i've finally figured out a way to bilk this school out of enough money to get us that condo in waikiki .
baby , you've done it all .
small potatoes .
the richard moffitt special needs grant .
the state is giving 100 grand in his name
to every school that has ...
that sounds iike you !
oh my god , they got the chest .

no .
nothing they do makes any sense , which is which is which is why we created the special needs class ...

lloyd?

cut it .
how many words can you fit inside a suitcase?
packed it so tight that you couldn't sing a tune
you fell down the stairs 'cause you didn't tie your bootlace
given a choice could you choose?
you went for a walk and you came across a cool place
rested your head with a vodka by the pool
you went for a swim and you found that you were sinking
don't you know pools are for fools?
given the choice could you choose?
groovin 'along all alone in the park
singing a song 'cause you're afraid of the dark
running away from a world that can't walk
swinging your hips so you don't have to talk ...
showing your girl 'bout a natural way of living
got bit in the ass by a tiger at the zoo
and when you got home you just passed out in the kitchen
now you got no one to lose
ran to the store and they sold you on the future
bit in your lip and you start to crack a smile
come up with a plan , but that doesn't really matter
when you got no reason why
given a choice could you try?
