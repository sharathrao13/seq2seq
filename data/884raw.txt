it was very popular here at one time .
a lot of pedigreed hamsters came over on ships from siberia .

that's right , we'll keep it in our room , mr. fawlty .
we'll look after it .

just getting rid of it .
polly , polly !
he take my hamster .
what?
mr. fawlty take my hamster !
he crazy , he think is rat !
why didn't you check?
what?
you mean he's had it for a whole year , and you've only just found out?
supposing the health inspector had seen it?
i know .
he could have closed us down .
what are you going to do with it , basil?
you can't keep it in here .
i know .
and don't let it loose in the garden .
it'll come back in the house .
can't we get you on " mastermind " , sybil?
next contestant , sybil fawlty from torquay , special subject , the bleedin 'obvious !
i wasn't going to let it go in the garden .
what are you going to do with it?
i don't know .
i'll take it away .
let it go .
give it its freedom .
you can't do that , basil .
he wouldn't be able to defend himself .
he's a rat , isn't he?
he's domesticated , aren't you?
you're domesticated , you do all right .
basil !
he won't get mugged by a gang of field mice , will he?
basil , he's manuel's pet .
we have a duty to it .
perhaps we could find a home for him .
all right !
i'll put an ad in the papers !
wanted ... kind home for enormous savage rodent .
answers to the name of sybil .
look , i'll take him out into the country ...
no !
i cannot abide cruelty to living creatures .
well , i'm a creature , you can abide it to me .
you're not living .
look , manuel , we were just wondering ...
mrs. fawlty , please understand .
if he go , i go .
well , goodbye .
please listen .
you know , we really can't keep him here .
the health inspector wouldn't ...
mrs. fawlty , he here one year , he do no harm .
but , manuel , listen .
if they see your rat , they could close the hotel down .
perhaps it would be simplest to have him put to s l e e p .
who?
him or the rat?
we might get a discount if we had 'em both done . " spleep "?
manuel , i've rung my friend .
it's all right .
she'll take him .
she has lots of animals , and it's not far from here , you can go see him whenever you want .
come on , we'll take him there now .
but he forget me !
rats are like that .
don't get involved with them .
i think it's the best solution , manuel .
oh , he'll be happy .
you'll see .
sad , isn't it?
well , look at it from the point of view of the rat .
what?
would you want to spend the rest of your life with manuel waiting on you?
we've been through the cupboards , you're doing the walls ,
terry , the filters , checked the fridges ...
come here .
right , that's done .
now , sybil , everything done here?
have you put the lid on the tank , basil?
that's why i've been on the roof the last 40 minutes .
and you took the pigeons out?
no , i left them in .
they're nearly done .
now , walls?
i've checked everything .
terry , the hoods .
we've done the cupboards?
it's all been done , basil .
the fridge .
have we got it all separate?
basil , i told you , it's all been done .
seals on the old fridge , the floor?
i've checked it .
just running over the bleeding obvious , dear .
so , all is shipshape and bristol fashion , eh?
all ready for old snoopy drawers?
is this about that rodent?
leave him alone , basil , he's upset .
he's not going to cheer up mooning about like that , is he?
just let him be .
it doesn't help him , you encouraging it .
you've got to get his mind off it .
well , manuel , what do you think?
looks good , doesn't it , eh?
all clean and shining bright?
so empty , without him .
yes , but those walls look good , too .
and the hoods , gleaming like that , isn't that a marvelous sight?
please leave me alone .
i get over it .
yes , no point in letting it get you down .
plenty more fish in the sea , eh?
don't !
what?
don't hit me .
always you hit me .
i'm not hitting you , i'm trying to cheer you up .
let him be , basil .
look , look ... don't look at me with those awful cow eyes .
wh ... why don't you go to the cinema tonight?
why don't you and polly go to the ice rink?
why don't you ... cheer up , for christ's sake !
basil !
i can not stand this awful self indulgence !
leave him alone , basil , he's just depressed .
manuel , my wife informs me that you're depressed .
let me tell you something , depression is a very bad thing .
it's like a virus .
if you don't stamp on it , it spreads throughout the mind , and then one day , you wake up in the morning , and you can't face life anymore .
and then you open a hotel .
we didn't win the war by getting depressed , you know?
manuel !? cmo?
not so sad .
no?
no , no .
it's too much .
too much?
much too much .
just a little bit sad .
there's the food .

cleaning behind the fridge?
well , you've got a lot on your mind .
we didn't want to worry you , mr. f ...
what do you mean?
a public health inspector coming after a 24 hour warning and a rat loose in the hotel , is that what you mean?
he must have escaped , mr. fawlty , and come back .
come back?
they home .
oh , i see .
he's a homing rat , is he?
oh yeah .
rats are amazing creatures , mr. fawlty .
i read about one once .
his owner had gone down to penzance ...
yes , yes .
i read about that .
when the chef got filleted with his own carving knife?
no , honest , scout's honor .
we'll find him , mr. fawlty !
well , if you could .
that would be lovely , before they close us down .

good thinking , about starting upstairs .
sybil , would you like to show mr. carnegie up?
i was just going to , basil .
and i'll keep an eye on things down here , find something to get on with .

bloody television exploding again .
i'll deal with it , you go upstairs .
that was a gun !
yes , it did sound like it , didn't it?
moths .
what is going on here?
i'll get him !
he'll come back for the nuts , you know?
he was sniffing around here just now .
sorry , sorry , major .
it wasn't the television at all .
it was just this gun .
i'll put it under lock and key straightaway .
why was he firing it in the hotel?
shooting starlings .
in the bar?
through the window .
i'll lock it away .
is it licensed?
oh , yes .
oh , yes .
you do realize that under the health and safety act it is your responsibility?
oh , yes .
i'm terribly sorry .
it's never happened before , mr. carnegie .
i'll have to notify the police , of course .
they will take steps .? qu?
polly ,? qu ha pasado?
it's all right , manuel .
is he all right?

the major tried to kill basil? !
kill basil? !
no , not mr. fawlty .
i mean basil , my little ...
ratatouille !
basil .
the little ...
ratatouille .
the chef calls the ratatouille basil , because he puts quite a lot of basil in it .

yes !
he's from barcelona .
you know , typical latin , really .
would you like to ...
why you do this?
i 'aven't , i 'aven't !
polly say you put basil in ratatouille .
i haven't made any bleeding ratatouille !
manuel !
well , why you say he put basil in ratatouille?
i had to say something .
that was the health inspector .
now , will you calm down?
where is he?
oh , i don't know !
perhaps he dead .
oh , 'e's all right .
give us the veal .
i've got to get lunch ready .
how you know he's all right?
the major fire his gun , perhaps he hit .
i find him !
sorry , polly .
oh , pick 'em up quick , before 'e gets in here .
that's it , major .
you've nearly got it .
the thing is , not a word about rats .
you were shooting a starling , all right?
a starling .
yes .
through the window .
right .
but , fawlty , how did the starling get in the bar?
no , no , no .
you were in the bar .
i was in the bar?
yes !
yes , i was !
and the starling was in the garden , and the rat was nowhere at all .
well , i didn't see him .

yeah , here they are , poll .
terry , listen to me .
what do you mean , " you picked them all up "?
manuel knocked 'em over .
we picked 'em all up .
oh , my god !
what's the matter?
one of them's got rat poison on it .
sorry , sorry !
veal's off , sorry .
that's veal?
no , no , this is ... veal substitute .
we're giving it a try , and it's a bit of a disappointment , i'm afraid .
in fact , it's no substitute at all .
polly , would you take the order again , please?
thank you , thank you so much .
i'm sorry about that .
would you like the lamb or the plaice?
veal substitute?
well , it's japanese , actually , soya beans and essence of cow .
seals?
we've moved all the meat into this one , and we've put the confectionery ...
ahem !
a bottle of the beaujolais , please .
certainly .
and the wash handbasin?
we ordered it yesterday .
here's the acknowledgement of the order .
well , it would appear that this kitchen is now in a satisfactory condition .
i shall be writing to confirm ...
sorry , it slipped . ... the outstanding points , and someone will be dropping in to carry out a future random inspection to make sure these standards are being maintained .
thank you .
marvelous .
it's 10 to 1 : 00 .
i'd like to take lunch here , if i may?
certainly , mr. carnegie .
i couldn't help noticing you had some veal over here ...
veal?
yes , it's dutch .
it's not dutch , actually .
it's norwegian .
norwegian?
yes .
not the absolute apex , quite honestly .
terry , the veal is dutch , isn't it?
norwegian , mrs. fawlty .
i've been in this business 20 years ,
i've never heard of norwegian veal .
they've only just branched into it .
i don't think it's a winner , frankly , more of a veal substitute .
it's got a lot of air pockets in it , that sort of thing .
the lamb is dutch .
dutch?
english , i mean .
we call it dutch 'cause it's as good as the veal .
better , honestly .
i prefer the veal .
how about lobster?
would you prefer lobster?
a couple of lobsters?
it's frightfully good at the moment .
it's not expensive this week .
we've got so much , we're having a sale to try and shift it all .
75p each , two for 1 .
can't say fairer than that .
just the veal .
if you like the veal ... perhaps you'd prefer the chicken?
basil , he wants the veal .
could i make a phone call?
yes , of course .
through here .
what's all this about rat poison on the veal?
he's put rat poison on one , they've got mixed up , and nobody knows which is which now .
well , what happened to the one the cat ate?
the cat? !
that's no good .
that might have poison on it too .
well , where is it?
what?
where's the cat's slice?
up here .
right .
now , how's the cat?
how's the cat?
we're about to take the life of a public health inspector and you want to know " how's the cat? " !
it's gone to london to see the queen !
what are we going to do?
he's all right !
great !
hooray !
hooray !
the cat lives !
the cat lives !
long live the cat !
what are we going to do? !
mr. fawlty , if the cat is all right , that means that slice is all right .
but how long would it take to work?
that stuff?
two minutes .
he had this 10 minutes ago at least .
it's a bit chewed there .
i'll give it a trim .
you're driving over to babbacombe this afternoon?
yes , we're ...
what is a plate of veal doing there?
i'll just relieve you of it , shall i?
do sit down , mr. carnegie .
he just has , basil .
on a plate of veal .
has it put you off?
what?
has it put you off the veal?
at all?
i'm not eating that one , if that's what you mean .
stop !
halt !
sorry , i think there might be another one .
excuse me .
ah , yes .
lucky guess .
well , who's responsible for putting them there?
manuel , our spanish waiter .
thank you .
now , would you care to take a seat right here?
please .
does he do it often?
oh no , no .
it's the first time .
sometimes looks as if he's going to .
we always catch him , of course .
here's your veal , mr. carnegie ,
and one green salad .
thank you .
ah , bon .
good appetit .
well done , terry .
sorry , not hot enough .
not big enough , sorry .
what?
not big enough , sorry .
excuse me .
really , polly !
what are you doing? !
well , if that's the one , these are okay .
what?
if that's the poison one , these are all right .
brilliant !
great , right .
okay .
basil , what is going on?
that was the poisoned one .
the cat had it .
the cat !
poisoned?
yes , so that one ... must be okay , hmm?
basil ...
sorry , just getting you a proper sized one .
it was big enough .
it was all i wanted .
well , it could have been a bit hotter .
well , not much , but ...
look ...
yes , yes .
it's just coming .
won't be a second .
manuel , would you ...
here .
what?
look , he's all right .
look !
he can't be .
well , he is .
here ya are , poll .
oh .
he can't be !
what do you mean?
he was vomiting .
vomiting?
that's just fur balls , basil .
what? !
that's just fur balls .
he does that all the time in the summer .
but ... but if he's all right , that one might ...
polly , polly !
too much .
what?
too much .
too much of a good thing always leaves one wanting less , i always find .
ugh .
what's wrong now?
we wouldn't want you to think that just because you were one of her majesty's civil servants , we were showing you any excess favoritism .
i'm sure you wouldn't want that .
oh !
so you're the rat inspector !
sorry , fawlty !
starling inspector .
starling inspector?
one for you .
thank you .
and one for you .
thank you .
do you mind?? qu?
we'll have one windsor soup , one pat , please .
one windsor ...
shh !
if the cat's slice is all right , that might be the poisoned one .
no , no .
yes , he's right .
and if the cat's one is all right ...
which it is ...
we can give him that , can't we?
right !
mr. fawlty?
shut up !
but , terry , that's got things on it .
that's all right , mrs. fawlty .
what the eye don't see , the chef gets away with .
mr. fawlty?
what is it? !
table seven !
what?
basil !
sorry , it's just coming .
excuse me .
of course ,
good afternoon , sir .
good afternoon , madam .
i was just trying to give an order to your waiter , and he walked away while i was doing it .
hmm?
he wasn't paying attention at all .
i'm so sorry .
what were you saying?
the waiter wasn't listening when i was giving him our order .
he seemed more interested in my fiance's legs .
really?
may i?
i don't think so .
in fact , i think there's a bread roll down there .
may i give my order?
oh , please .
of course .
we'd like one windsor soup and one pat , and then a ...
