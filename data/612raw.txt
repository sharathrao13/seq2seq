what service?
the one at the unitarian church last week ... where you two got married to each other .

we're going down to the station .
what , is it a fucking crime to fart?
motherfucker !
no fucking way .
dante and randall slapped you with a restraining order?
ain't that about a bitch?
so , are you going to abide by the court's ruling ... or are you going to go " bandit , " reynolds style?
thejudge said if we go within a hundred feet ... of the stores , we get thrown into county .
you know what they make you do in county?
toss the salad .
i guess if you guys really wanted ... to hang out in front of a convenience store ... you couldjust buy your own now ... what with all that money you guys made . hell , yeah , bitch .
wait a sec .
what money?
the money from the " bluntman and chronic " movie .
oh , my god .
don't tell me you have no idea ... there's a movie being made ... of the comic you two were the basis for .
what?
since when? here's the pulse , all right?
and this is your finger far from the pulse , jammed straight up your ass .
say , would you like a chocolate covered pretzel?
you see , kids , if you read " wizard " ... you'd know that it's the top story this month .
check it out .
when the fuck did this happen?
well , after " x men " hit at the box office ... all the studios started buying up ... every comic property they could get ... their dirty little hands on .
miramax optioned " bluntman and chronic .
miramax?
i thought they only made classy pictures ...
like " the piano " or " the crying game .
yeah , well , once they made " she's all that " ... everything went to hell .
so you're saying you haven't gotten a monetary cut ... of the movie?
didn't holden mcneil and banky edwards ... used to pay you likeness rights for the comic book?
we haven't seen a fucking dime for no movie .
well , boys , i'm no lawyer , but i think holden and banky ... owe you some of that proverbial phat cash .
lfl was you guys , i would find holden mcneil ... and ask for my movie check .
shit , yeah .
we gots to get paid .
and on that note , we cue the music .
mat mat mat l l lum
mat mat mat lip la
mat mat mat l l lum
mat mat meal ma ma ma , ma ma ma ma
well ...
look at these morose motherfuckers right here .
smells like somebody shit in their cereal .
bung ! ha ha ha !
that was good .
come on in .
so , what brings you two dirt merchants ... to my neck of the woods?
i'll tell you what our necks are doing in your woods .
where's our motherfucking movie check?
you heard about that , huh?
i got nothing to do with it .
that's banky's deal . he owns the property now .
i sold my half of the " bluntman and chronic " rights ... to him years ago .
why the fuck would you do a thing like that?
why in god's name would i wanna keep writing ... about characters whose central preoccupation ... is weed and dick and fart jokes?
i mean , you got to grow , man .
don't you ever want anything more for yourself?
i know this poor hapless son of a bitch does .
i look into his sorry doe eyes ... and ljust i see a man crying out . he's crying out , " when , lord?
when the fuck can your servant ...
ditch this foul mouthed little chucklehead ...
to whom i am a constant victim of his folly ...
so much so that it prevents him ...
from ever getting to kiss a girl?
fuck !
when , lord , when?
when's gonna be my time?
he knows .
i'm the chucklehead?
you're the fucking dumb ass ... who gave your comic away , and now you don't get ... no fucking movie check , neither .
when you're right , you're right .
i wish i held onto a little piece of that thing ... because if the buzz is any indicator ... that movie's going to make some huge bank .
what buzz?
the lnternet buzz .
what the fuck is the lnternet?
the lnternet is a communications tool ... used the world over , where people can come together ... to bitch about movies and share pornography with one another . here's what we're looking for moviepoopshoot . com .
poop shoot .
yeah .
this is a site populated by militant movie buffs sad , pathetic little bastards ...
living in their parents 'basement ... downloading scripts ... and what they think is inside information ... about movies and actors they claim to despise ... yet can't stop discussing .
ok , this is about " bluntman and chronic " right here .
lnside sources tell me ...
miramax is starting production this friday ...
on their adaptation of underground comic fave ...
'bluntman and chronic . " '
friday?
shit , does it say who's fucking playing us ... in the movie?
no , but it's miramax ... so i'm sure it'll be ben affleck and matt damon .
you know , they put them in a bunch of movies .
who?
you know , those kids from " good will hunting .
you mean that fucking movie with mork from ork in it?
yeah , i wasn't a big fan , either ... but affleck was the bomb in " phantoms .
word , bitch .
phantoms " 'like a motherfucker .
what's up now?
ahem .
all right .
so , here we go .
now , this is the shoot back section .
this is where the people who read the news ... get to chime in with their two cents .
for example , we got a guy here ... with the chick magnet net handle " wompa one " ... opining on what he thinks about " bluntman and chronic . " he says , " bluntman and chronic and their stupid alter egos ...
jay and silent bob only work in small doses , if at all .
they don't deserve their own movie .
he's got a point .
fuck him .
what's the next one say?
this is entitled " fuck them up their stupid asses . " " 'bluntman and chronic 'is the worst comic i ever read .
jay and silent bob are stupid characters
a couple of stoners who spout dumb ass catch phrases ...
like a third rate cheech and chong ...
or bill and ted .
fuck jay and silent bob .
fuck them up their stupid asses .
who the fuck said that shit?
a guy who calls himself " magnolia fan .
all right , here , check this one out .
jay and silent bob are one notejokes ...
that only stoners laugh at .
they're fucking clown shoes .
mmm .
lf they were real , i'd beat the shit out of them ...
for being so stupid .
i , for one , will be boycotting this movie .
who's with me?
then there's , like , fifty more posts ... of people who are joining spartacus's here boycott .
i'm gonna kill all these fucks .
let it go , man .
they're not talking about you guys .
they're talking about bluntman and chronic .
they said jay and silent bob .
they used our real names .
it doesn't matter if there's a comic book version of us ... and a real version ... because no one knows we're real in real life .
really?
all these people reading that shit ... think the real jay and silent bob ... are a couple jerkoffs ... because of what all these dickheads are writing ... about the comic book jay and silent bob .
maybe one night me and lunch box are out ... we're mackin 'some chick and shit , and she's , like ...
ooh , i wanna suck youse guys 'dicks off " ... and she's , like , " what's your names?
and i'm , like , " jay and silent bob .
reco'nize .
and she's like , " oh , i've read on the lnternet ...
that fuckin 'youse guys ...
are a couple of little fuckin 'jerkoffs .
and then she goes and sucks two other guys 'dicks off instead .
well , fuck that .
we gotta put a stop ... to these fuckin 'hateful sons of bitches ... before they ruin our good names .
first of all , i don't know how good your names are .
second of all , there's not much you can do ... about stopping this bile .
the lnternet has given everyone in america a voice ... and evidently , everyone in america has chosen ... to use that voice to bitch about movies .
as long as there's a " bluntman and chronic " movie ... the net nerds are gonna have something negative ... to say about it .
well , wait a second .
lf there wasn't a " bluntman and chronic " movie ... then those fuckers wouldn't be saying shit ... about jay and silent bob , right?
they're not saying anything about you now , ok?
they're talking about fictional characters .
fictional characters .
am l am i getting through to you at all?
so all we gotta do is go stop ... the fuckin 'movie from gettin 'made .
yeah , and forego the hundreds of thousands of dollars ... that you two would be entitled to in the process .
what are you , fucking retarded?
i don't think i'm alone in the world ... in imagining this flick may be the worst idea ... since greedo shooting first .
you know , it a jay and silent bob movie?
who would pay to see that?
but , since it appears inevitable ...
i recommend that you guys go hunt banky down ... and get yo 'mother fuckin 'movie check ... as you so succinctly put it ...
'cause that's what's important , right?
um , no , holden mcneil .
the important thing here is a fuckin 'bunch ... of motherfuckers we don't even know ... callin 'us assholes on the lnternet ... to teenagers and guys who can't even get laid .
puttin 'a stop to that is the most important thing ... we could ever do .
so when's this movie gettin 'made?
uh , they start this friday .
so if today's tuesday , that gives us ...
eight days .
uh , three by my count , but close .
right .
my bad .
three days to stop that fuckin 'stupid movie ... from gettin 'made .
come on , silent bob .
we're goin 'to hollywood .
tickets?
since when did they start charging for the bus?
didn't we used to ride that shit ... to school every morning for free?
'cause you're doing it all wrong .
you gotta give the driver a little incentive .
like how?
like this ...
yeah , but what happens when they pick you up ... and you don't make with the head?
don't they kick your ass to the curb?
sure , if you don't make with the head .
yeah . hey , if it'll get me ... a couple of hundred miles across the country ...
i'll take a shot in the mouth .
yeah , but we ain't gay .
don't be so suburban .
it's the new millennium .
gay , straight it's all the same now .
there are no more lines .
well , there's a line , and on this side of it , we ain't gay . hey , all the hitchers do this .
why do you think people pick us up?
lf you get a ride , it's expected .
i don't care who the driver is .
it's the first rule in the book .
what book?
the unwritten book of the road .
follow the rules of the book ... and you get where you're going in no time .
excuse me .
i don't care ifit rains or freezes
you both don't have to sit back there .
why doesn't one of you come sit next to me?
where are you boys from?
new jersey , but we're on our way to hollywood .
oh , hollywood , huh?
that's a long ways away .
yeah .
thank god you picked us up .
well , do unto others .
that's what the book says .
wait a sec .
you follow the book , too?
i live my life by it .
you?
of course .
so ... you live by the book , too?
well , you picked us up , didn't you?
i gotta .
well , that's good to hear .
but it's a lot easier to say that you live by the book ... than to actually do it .
can you do it?
all right .
mmm , mmm .
whoa !
i can't believe this shit .
five hours and not a single ride .
every day people hitch to hollywood ... to stop studios from making films about 'em ... but when you and me try it ... it's like we're trapped in a fuckin 'cartoon .
zoinks , yo .
now we can finally solve the mystery ... of the hitchhiking ghouls .
pull off their masks and let's see who they really are .
i don't think they are masks .
and i don't think ... that they're hitchhiking girls , either .
ghouls , you fuckin 'moron , not girls .
i wish they were hitchhiking girls sexy hitchhiking girls .
let's kick 'em out .
we've got a mystery to solve .
the only mystery here is why we take our cues ... from a dick in a neckerchief .
keep it up , beatnik .
i'll feed you to the fuckin 'dog !
i can't take all of this fighting !
yo !
youse guys need to turn those frowns upside down .
and i gotjust the thing for that .
we call it ...
doobie snacks .
i like to dream
yes , yes
right between the sound machine
on a cloud ofsight i drift in the night
anyplace it goes is right , goes far
to the stars away from here , well
ri , ray and rirent rob .
we can find
i think they passed out .
great .
what do we do with them now?
let's cut out their kidneys and sell it to the black market ... and leave 'em in a seedy motel bathtub full of ice .
aaah !
no , no , no !
you see something?
see anything?
fuck , man , i had a horrible dream .
yo , man , i'm hungry .
where can we get some breakfast?
who's a friend to the king of all the monkeys
yeah .
ooh , check that shit out , man , the lnternet .
let's see if those fucks wrote something new ... about us and that stupid ass flick .
any movie based on jay and silent bob ...
are gonna lick balls ...
because they both , in fact , lick balls .
motherfucker .
it's time we wrote something back .
type this shit down .
all you motherfuckers are gonna pay .
you all are the ones who are the ball lickers .
we're gonna fuck your mothers while you watch ... and cry like little whiny bitches .
once we get to hollywood and find those miramax fucks ... who is makin 'the movie ... we're gonna make them eat our shit ... then shit out our shit ... and then eat their shit that's made up of our shit ... that we made 'em eat .
and then all you motherfucks are next .
love , jay and silent bob .
that'll show those fucks .
now we can eat our egg a mooby muffin ... then get back on the road ... go to hollywood , and stop those fucks ... from makin 'that movie .
no more hairy bush nuns , no more dogs .
we keep our eye on the prize and let nothing ... and i mean nothing , distract us .

so we went to see holden mcneil ... and he showed us the lnternet .
and that's where we found ... all these little fuckin 'jerkoffs ... talkin 'shit about us .
so we decided to go to hollywood ... and stop the movie from gettin 'made .
and now we're here .
i have no idea what you just said .
i get that a lot .
so you like animals , huh?
sure .
that's cool .
even snakes?

she went for the setup .
reach in your pants and pull your cock out , bitch .
girls like that kind of shit .
right about here's ... where the angel's supposed to show up ... and tell you not to pull your dick out ... but we bitch slapped that motherfucker ... and sent him packing , so it's smooth sailing .

speakin 'of lickin 'balls , man , how 'bout that justice chick?
she is too fine .
and she smells so fuckin 'pretty .
she has a nice voice , too .
and that body fuckin 'smokin '.
you know , she didn't tell me to fuck off once ... when i was talkin 'to her ... or pull out the fuckin 'pepper spray or anything .
you know , lunch box , she could be the one .
smooth move , justice .
nice going , four eyes .
ow !
why the fuck did you let that little stoner ... throw brent out of the van?
oh , please .
lfl had to listen ... to one more of those stupid songs ...
i was gonna throw him out myself .
we needed brent , justice . he was our patsy , remember?
we'll just find someone else .
besides , i didn't see you trying ... to stop jay from throwing him out .
yeah , i didn't want to blow our cover .
cover , schmover .
you all hated his songs , too .
not as much as i hate you .
we have a very simple gang here , justice .
i'm the brains , chrissy's the brawn ... and missy's the tech girl ... but lately , i'm having a little trouble ... figuring out what you're doing here .
shit , your name doesn't even fit the rhyme scheme .
since you let our patsy slip away , you've gotta convince ... the little kid and the fat guy to take his place .
they've gotta break into provasik now .
uh uh .
uh huh .
you'll do it or you're out of the gang , justice .
just use the little one's crush on you to convince him ... since he's so fucking in love with you .
jay?
no , he's not .
what am i , blind? he wasn't kissing your hand in the back of the van ...
like he was fucking lord byron?
well , maybe he just has manners .
yo , baby , you ever have your asshole licked ... by a fat man in an overcoat?
yeah .
we got about two hours before we get to boulder .
that'll give you plenty of time to work on him .
i'm not gonna do it .
why the fuck not?
because he's just so innocent !
look at him .
who's it gonna be , jussy , him or us?
steal a monkey?
shit , no problem .
it's not stealing a monkey .
i mean , it's liberating it
wait a second .
did you say " no problem "?
yeah .
fuck , we steal monkeys all the time .
right , lunch box?
well , it's not like it's a bad thing .
i mean , it's for a good cause .
oh , it's for the best cause , ma cherie the cause of love .
snoogans .
what the heck is that?
what's what?
snoogans , i believe it was .
what the fuck do you think it means?
it means i'm kidding .
oh .
well , that's too bad .
i can't believe i'm gonna get some pussy
for stealing the monkey
stealing the little monk
lf i had known that shit earlier ... man , i'd have been stealin 'monkeys ... since i was , like , seven and shit .

they take the heat off of us long enough ... until we can get out of town .
but

who let the cats out , huh?
wait . ls that ...
excuse me .
who the hell are you?
federal wildlife marshal .
this investigation's now under my jurisdiction .
oh , really?
and why is that?
because someone let a whole mess of animals ... out of their cages , sir .
we believe that was just a diversionary tactic ... used to call attention away from the real heist ... over here at the diamond exchange .
yeah , right .
that's a believable scenario .
sounds more like something out of a bad movie .
sir ... the provasik people say they rounded up ... all their animals except for one an orangutan .
the most dangerous animal known to man .
sir , this was just delivered to the station .
what is what is it what is it?
a tape of the terrorists who claim responsibility ... for the break in .
do you have a vcr?
i am the clit commander .
oh , my god .
plaschke , willenholly .
yeah , look , i need you to get me on the national news pronto .
why?
because we may very well be dealing ... with the two most dangerous men on the planet .
this is jussy's monkey .
justice died for you , you little monkey fuck !
do something , tons of fun .
holy fuck .
ls that thing waving at us?
holy shit , it understood us .
maybe it's some kind of super monkey .
you're my fuckin 'bitch .
you get my back .
don't be taking this fuckin 'chimp's side .
what if there's more super monkeys up at that lab?
maybe they're making an army of 'em up there . holy shit !
maybe it's a conspiracy , like in the " x files " ...
roswell style .
this little monkey ... could be the fuckin 'damn dirty ape ... responsible for the fall of the human race .
aaah !
ja y : ln this world gone mad , we won't spank the monkey ... the monkey will spank us .
i'm not even supposed to be here today .
aaah !
and after the fall ofman ... these monkey fucks will start wearing our clothes ... and rebuilding the world in their image .
oh , when only those as super smart as me ... will be left alive to bitterly cry ... you maniacs !
damn youse !
god damn youse all to hell !
shit .
not on my watch , motherfucker .

aah !
all right , you can live ... for now .
did you see that shit , man?
bitches love me .
come on , let's get something to eat .
what , man , we ain't hiding in the woods no more .
we gotta get to hollywood .
besides , we're in the clear , yo .
it's not like anyone knows we stole the monkey .
bitch .
i'm reg hartner with an exclusive " news now " bulletin .
the provasik animal testing facility in boulder ... was the focus of an attack by a terroristic ... primate rescue syndicate calling themselves ... the coalition for liberation of ltinerant tree dwellers ... or simply c. l. l . t.
ln a videotape sent to authorities this morning ... credit for the liberation of an orangutan ... from the lab last night is taken by these men identified in literature that accompanied the tape ... as jay and silent bob .
ln this chilling clip , they make it very clear ... that they are in control of the c. l. l . t.
we are the c. l. l .
t. none ofyou are safe .
now tremble before the might of our merciless leader .
i am the c. l. l . t. commander !
terrifying .
now here to help us explain this footage ... is federal wildlife marshal willenholly .
marshal willenholly , thanks for joining us .
at this point , what can you tell us about the c. l. l . t.?
from the intelligence we've been gathering ... we've discovered that the c. l. l . t ... is actually a tiny offshoot of the l. a. b. l . a.
uh , the liberate apes before lmprisoning apes movement?
exactly .
now , the two men that you saw in the video ... they go by the obvious code names of jay and silent bob .
lf anyone out there should come across them ... or any other c. l. l . t. ies , please exercise extreme caution .
see?
told you that restraining order was a good idea .
what response do you hope to elicit ... by putting this kind of pressure on the c. l. l . t.?
it's a difficult situation .
you don't want to rub the c. l. l . t. the wrong way .
nights like this ...
i miss dating a lesbian .
ls that your cell phone , sir?
plaschke .
give me a friggin 'break .
i'm on my way .
we've got 'em .
they're in utah .
citizens of utah ... stimulation of the c. l. l . t. is not recommended .
well , your plan worked .
the news is all about jay , bob , and your c. l. l .
t ... with almost no mention of the diamond heist .
i told you those two were the perfect patsies .
don't you have any regret?
jay and bob don't deserve this .
they were really sweet .
the only thing i regret is not gutting ... that little trout mouth prick like a fish ... and playing twister with his vitals .
mmm !
you know , i don't get you , justice .
you used to be all about this girl stuff stealing , boning , blowing shit up ... and now you're like this little priss with a conscience .
it's really a fucking drag .
we all gotta grow up sometime .
oh , ifmoping around over some boy you're crushing on is growing up ... then pass me my wonder woman underoos .
ow !
yo , marvelous pizza coming thr hey ! hi .
you the gals that ordered the pizza?
this dopey bitch ordered a large plain ... but i could go for some hot thick sicilian .
no charge , lady . hurry !
i'm sorry , jay .
you know , justice died trying to save this monkey ... so maybe we should keep it around .
that way , we can honor her memory .
now ain't you glad we came here to eat?
and you were all piss scared ... we'd get busted by the cops or something .
you know what i say .
fuck the police
fuck , fuck , fuck the police
yo , yo , fuck the police
fuck , fuck , fuck the police
yo , fuck 'em
this is the utah state police .
boys , we know you're in there .
come on out with your hands in the air ... and surrender the orangutan .
think they're talking about us?
sorry .
don't shoot . hold your fire .
who the hell are you?
federal wildlife marshal .
ls the monkey in there?
the ape .
what?
orangutan's a member of the great ape family .
it's not a monkey .
look , who's the federal wildlife marshal here?
me or you?
that's what i thought .
can i use your
jay and silent bob .
your c. l. l . t. doesn't stand a chance .
anyone not harboring ... a fugitive monkey in there should hit the deck .
we are going to open fire .
what the fuck are you waiting for?
get out there and give him the monkey .
look , man , fuckin 'maybe it ain't so bad up at that lab .
maybe they experiment on 'em by making 'em ... fuck a bunch of different good lookin 'monkeys .
we don't know .
you stay out of this , you weepy little chimp .
fuck , man , i'm no strategist .
you're the guy who makes the blueprints .
i don't have the fuckin 'smarts of a little ...
kid .
do not shoot !
don't shoot !
we're just , uh , trying to take our son ... out of this hostile environment .
their son?
maybe they're one of those gay couples .
yeah , we're gay ... and this is our adopted love child .
we're not from around here .
don't make us go back to our liberal city home ... with tales of prejudice and bigotry ... from in the heart of utah .
oh , god , this is the last thing i need a bunch of uppity homosexuals shooting their mouths off ... to the liberal media ... that the federal wildlife marshal office persecutes gays .
are you fuckin 'crazy?
now , they may be gay ... but that's not their son .
that's the ape .
i think i would recognize an ape if i saw one , ok?
and the only thing i do recognize right now ... is the political fiasco here that i'm about to avoid ... by letting this butt fucking brady bunch go .
ahh .
you are free to leave , sirs .
yes , you sirs .
so we can just go?
yes , sir .
please accept my apologies ... for detaining you and your unorthodox ... but constitutionally protected family unit .
un fuckin 'believable .
i might add that's one fine looking boy ... you're raising there . hell , yeah .
that's 'cause he's from my sperm .
see , i knocked up this hot woman friend of ours ... who i fuck on the side ... so i'm not to be all the way gay ...
he loves the cock .
well , he certainly looks insatiable .
bye bye .
bye bye .
well , it's not my way , but i'll be damned ... if there doesn't go one happy family .
all right , gang .
let's just shoot some tear gas into the diner ... and then , when the guys come out with the monkey
fuck beans !
that was them , wasn't it?

i didn't think so .
look , man , she doesn't wanna go back to the lab .
and for the record , i ain't gay .
and for the record , while we're on the subject ...
i knew that that wasn't a real little boy .
for one more record , he loves the cock .
on your knees , texas pete .
let's go !

oh , yeah .
well , this fuckin 'blows , man .
we have one more day to stop these fucks ... from shooting this movie ... and they fuckin 'took the one thing i had left ... from the one woman i loved enough ... not to stick my hand down her pants .
what , go after the monkey? how the fuck do we know where that car's going?
don't just point like ...
wh you gotta take a shit .
no , no , no , you gotta take a salad .
what the fuck are you trying to say?
just say it , man .
don't make me ask twenty questions .
you could always tell that stupid amy story all the time ... but you can't spit out fuckin ', " yo , jay , i disagree " ... or " yo , those are some good cheese fries .
just fuckin 'say it already !
the sign on the back of the car ... said " critters of hollywood , " you dumb fuck !
say it , don't spray it .
and might i add ... that is one fine looking boy you are raising .
well ... if it isn't the wildlife expert . heh .
your office faxed this over .
now , the guy said it was a post from an lnternet chat board ... signed by a " jay and silent bob .

it's not like cheating .
justice blew up .
all right , here's the plan .
first we find out ... where they're shooting this movie ... and after we bust that shit up ... we can start lookin 'for the monkey .
but before we do any of that shit ... we gotta find a motherfucker in the know someone like the mayor of hollywood .

and at the same time , find my ex girlfriend ... who was killed in a car explosion's monkey .

ls hollywood ready for jay and silent bob?
a source at the federal wildlife marshal's office ... tells us that a posting was pulled off ... an lnternet movie chat board allegedly written ... by the two domestic terrorists themselves .
it's sending a shockave through hollywood .
jules asner is on the scene at miramax studios .
jules?
steve , the tenor of tinseltown is one of terror today ... after the federal wildlife marshal's office has learned ... that hot new terrorists jay and silent bob ... have targeted miramax studios ... for their next campaign of blood , violence ... and monkey theft .
ln a posting pulled off of moviepoopshoot . com ... the gruesome twosome threatened , and i quote ...
once we get to hollywood and find those miramax " expletive deleted " who are making ...
the " bluntman and chronic " movie ...
we're gonna make them eat our " expletive deleted
then " expletive deleted " out our " expletive deleted " then eat their " expletive deleted
which is made up of our " expletive deleted
that we made them eat .
unquote .
so far we've been unable to get a statement ... from anybody here at the studio .
but no sign of jay and silent bob?
none whatsoever ... what jay and silent bob even look like ... so for all we know , they could already be on the lot .
shit !
ben affleck and matt damon ... are shooting a project on the lot . have you seen them roaming around?
no , steve , but ...
fuck it .
ok . he's got a pass .
let him in .

echo base , i've got a 1 0 07 ... two unauthorized on the lot , requesting backup .
i thought that was a 10 82 .

ooh , that affleck .
backup on the way . hey , i'll make you a deal .
this guy will suck your dick off if you let us go . heh .
contrary to what you believe ... not everyone in the industry is a homosexual . how about this deal? he'll suck my dick while you watch and jerk off .
all right .

it's either this or jail ... and you know what they do to you in jail .

do not look at ben or matt directly in the eyes ... or you will be fired .
does everybody understand that?
thank you .

'cause your friend says you owe him .
then sometimes you gotta go back to the well .

go back to making your adult movie .
these men are the leaders of a terrorist organization ... wanted for the abduction of a little monkey .
they didn't really steal that monkey .
it wasjust a diversion so that we could steal these .
and they're not the leaders of the c. l. l . t.
the c. l. l . t. is not real .
no , no , no .
no , the c. l. l . t. 's real .
the c. l. l . t. 's real all right .
it's the female orgasm that's the myth .
you know what i'm talking about?
are you guys all right?
i thought you blew up , boo boo kitty fuck .
you remembered !
oh , it was a frame up , jay .
missy , sissy , chrissy , and i are international jewel thieves .
we were setting you up to be a patsy ... but i couldn't go through with it because l because i love you .
yeah?
that means you're gonna fuck me , right?
of course .
slssy : lfshe does , it'll be considered necrophilia ... because she's gonna be one dead bitch . hi , jussy .
we catch you at a bad time?
you should have just let these guys go down , jussy .
i wanted to go down , but this angel ... popped on my shoulder and was , like , " listen .
and i was , like , " what's up?
shut the fuck up before i shoot you ... where you stand in your pansy red booties . holy shit , i am wearing pansy red booties .
why the fuck didn't you tell me?
let's have those diamonds , justice .
i can't do that , sissy .
then lover boy gets one in the fucking brain .
yo , lovely ladies !
would any of y'all like a private audition ... to be in my movie?
bring that ass over .
come on !
ow !
shit !
shit !
shit !
oh , fuck me ! ha ha !
crazy crackers with guns?
time for me to get my black ass out of here .
you really let me down , justice .
throwing it all away ... for a little stoner with bad pronunciation .
what's it gonna be , sissy?
which fighting style do you want me to kick your ass in?
are you kidding me?
i taught you all your moves myself .
there's no style you can bust that i can't defend against .
you're no match for my shao lin monk .
yeah , but i'll bury you with my crouching tiger .
a little venus flytrap?
i'll counter with dragon queen . how about a little " bitch , my man ain't your baby's daddy?
bring it on .
aah !
fucking stupid bitch !
yo , i hope one rips off the other one's shirt ... and we see some fuckin 'titties ... floppin 'around and shit in the air .
yeah !
mr. biggs , mr. van der beek , i just wanted to say hi .
i'm
banky fuckin 'edwards !
just the motherfucker we came to see ! holy shit !
what the fuck are you guys doing here?
why the hell are you shooting at me?
two reasons .
one we're walkin ', talkin 'bad girl cliches !
and two because you're a man !
aah !
only on the outside .
stop the movie?
are you crazy?
all these assholes on the lnternet are calling us names ... because of this fucking stupid movie .
that's what the lnternet's for slandering others anonymously .
stopping the flick isn't gonna stop that !
this isn't fair !
we came to hollywood , i fell in love .
fuckin 'we stole a monkey , we got shot at ... and i got punched in the motherfuckin 'nuts ... by a guy named cock knocker !
you know what?
i feel for you boys , i really do .
but miramax you know , miramax films paid me a shitload of money for " bluntman and chronic " ... so it occurs to me that people bad mouthing you ... on some website is none of my fucking concern !
oh , but i think it is .
ow !
ow !
we had a deal with you on the comics , remember ... for likeness rights ... and as we're not only the artistic basis ... but also , obviously , the character basis ... for your intellectual property , " bluntman and chronic " ... when said property was optioned by miramax films ... you were legally obliged to secure our permission ... to transfer the concept to another medium .
as you failed to do that , banky ... you are in breach of the original contract .
ergo , you find yourself in a very actionable position .
yeah .
you guys are gonna ruin my movie career .
well , we want something for our mental anguish .
tell you what we'll settle this monetarily .
i'll give you half of what i make . half? half's not good enough?
fine .
i'll give you two thirds of what i make .
fuck you .
you already said half .
you can't take it back .
done .
your shit is so tired , justice .
call me boo boo kitty fuck ... bitch . hyah !
aah !
hello?
truce?
i think i killed both of them .
i am an excellent marksman .
i've always
oh ... god .
come on , you guys .
it's over .
you all right , boo boo kitty fuck?
i was just about to jump in and fuckin 'get your back .
uh huh .
holy shit , the cops .
we gotta get out of here .
no , no , no .
i'm tired of running .
oh , marshal . hey , you awake?
wake up , marshal .
oh .
are you ok?
oh , my god , i'm paralyzed !
that monkey shot me in the ass and paralyzed me !
oh , sweet irony !
you're not paralyzed .
it was just a tranquilizer .
oh , jesus !
ow !
tranked by a little monkey !
my friends in the bureau ... are never gonna let me hear the end of this .
you have friends in the fbl?
uh huh .
they all made it in , but i failed the exam .
why the hell else do you think i became ... a federal wildlife marshal?
i'll tell you why !
because i'm a joke !
maybe not .
i can make you a deal that will get you into the fbl ... regardless of test scores .
what kind of deal?
you get the charges dropped against jay and silent bob ... and say you never found the ape .
ln exchange , i will give you the diamonds we stole ... and turn in missy , chrissy , sissy , and myself .
but i want a reduced sentence .
you'd be willing to do that?
for him , i'd be willing to do anything .
i'm an international jewel thief who's facing a jail sentence .
that's all right .
i'm a junkie with a monkey .
lf i go to prison , will you wait for me?
i don't know .
will you fuck me when you get out?
don't change the subject .
will we fuck when you get out?
snoogans .
wow , there's a lot of love in the room .
regardless of what you may have heard ...
i do not kiss guys .
ok .
play it cool , hotshot .
sorry , justice .
we gotta go .
hey , stop stealing monkeys .
fuck you .
fair enough .
wait for me .
what , here?
well , boys , you're rich , in love
well , you're in love .
to top it off , you got your own monkey .
what more could two guys from jersey possibly want?
well , to have these fucks stop talking shit about us ... on the lnternet for starters .
what have i been telling you?
there's not much you can do to stop that .
well , short of showing up at all their houses ... and beating the shit out of them , i guess .
you know , with all the money we're making , man ... we could buy a lot of plane tickets . how many people want to kick some ass
yeah?
do you post as " magnolia fan " on moviepoopshoot . com?
yeah .
did you write ...
fuck jay and silent bob .
fuck them and their stupid asses "?
yeah .
a while ago .
so? how many people want to kick some ass
i do , i do
and how many people are sick ofholding it back
i want ...
on moviepoopshoot . com ... did you say jay and silent bob are quote " fucking clown shoes , and if they were real ...
i'd kick the shit out of them for being so stupid "?
yeah .
really? how many people are sick ofholding it back
i am , i am how many people want to kick some ass how many people want to kick some ass how many people want to kick some ass
what you gonna do
when you're sick ofholding it back
that's right .
that's it .
uh huh .
right .
that's right .
that's right .
that's right .
right .
right .
i think i'll kick some ass how many people want to kick some ass
i would ifl could
but i'm reallyjust a sensitive artist
i'm reallyjust a sensitive artist
that's beautiful , man .
now that was worse than " clash of the titans .
i can't believe judi dench played me . heh .
remind me to renew that restraining order .
why?
'cause i'm gonna blast that flick on the lnternet tonight .
why can't hollywood ever make a decent comic book movie?
tell 'em , steve dave .
would you stop saying that?
well ... that was just another paean to male adolescence ... and its refusal to grow up .
yeah , sis , but it was better than " mallrats .
at least holden had the good sense ... to keep his name off of it .
why wouldn't miramax option his other comic instead ... the one with you and him and your " relationship "?
what , " chasing amy "?
that'd never work as a movie .
but
i'm so fucking embarrassed .
well , honey , you should be .
took your characters and turned them ... into one 90 minute long gay joke .
it's like watching " batman and robin " again .
thanks .
that means a lot coming from the guy ... who pretends to be shaft ... as opposed to the guy who takes shaft .
uh uh .
i don't hear you complaining nightly .
i don't get out to the movies much ... but i just have to say " bluntman and chronic " ... was blunt tastic .
are these leg cuffs really necessary?
don't make me shoot you , justice .
