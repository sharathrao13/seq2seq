i'll have to get a cup .
good plan .
i've never been here before .
just passing through on my way to hartford .
you're a regular jack kerouac .
mind if i sit down?
actually , i'm meeting someone ...
i'm joey .
okay .
you don't have a name?
i do have a name .
i just am really meeting someone .
so i guess i should get going .
so soon?
what?
i'm just screwing with your mind .
it's nice to meet you .
enjoy hartford .
enjoy your coffee , mystery woman .
i like that .
hey , it's freezing .
what do you need?
hot tea , coffee?
lip gloss .
i have vanilla , chocolate , strawberry , and toasted marshmallow .
anything in there not resembling a breakfast cereal?
yes .
it has no smell , but it changes colors with your mood .
rupaul doesn't need this much makeup .
you're crabby .
i'm sorry .
i lost my macy gray cd , and i need caffeine .
i have your cd .
thief .
sorry , and i will get you some coffee .
what?
it's not for me .
it's for rory , i swear .
you're shameless .
look , officer krupke ... she's right at that table , right over there .
he's got quite a pair , this guy .
thanks .
i've never been through here before .
you have , too .
hi .
you really like my table , don't you?
i was just ...
getting to know my daughter .
are you my new daddy?
you don't look old enough to have a daughter .
i mean it .
and you don't look like a daughter .
that's possibly very sweet of you .
thanks .
so , daughter .
you know , i am traveling with a friend .
she's 16 .
bye .
drive safe .
here you go .
thanks .
independence inn , michel speaking .
no , i'm sorry .
we're completely booked .
we have a wedding party here .
no , there is really nothing i can do .
yes , i'm sure .
positive .
no , i don't have to look , ma'am .
yes , of course i'll look .
no , i'm sorry .
we're completely booked .
no , don't move .
just ignore the tiny woman pushing the 200 pound instrument around .
this is good .
i like this .
maybe after this i'll bench press a piano .
that's it , lady .
tie your shoe now .
don't worry .
i'll wait .
hi , drella .
hi .
i was just wondering , could you be nicer to the guests?
i'm sorry .
did you not want a harp player?
yes , i did .
did you not want a great harp player?
yes , i did .
i am a great harp player .
and this is my great harp , okay?
so if you just want someone to be nice to the guests ... get a harmonica player .
some guy who whistles through his nose .
okay?
capisce?
and that is a great spot for a table .
the decorator's a genius .
madame , you have no idea how desperately i'd like to help ... but i'd have to build a room for you myself ... and i'm not a man who works with his hands .
so the best i can do is suggest ... that you please try for another weekend .
any weekend .
good .
fine .
the 21st .
hold on , i'll look .
no , i'm sorry .
we're completely booked .
has the plumber attended to room 4 yet?
he was here .
he did nothing .
it's $100 .
hi , marco .
lorelai .
talk to me about room 4 .
what was wrong with it?
i thought you replaced that already .
because you told me you did .
i never forget anything .
so this one's on you , right?
pleasure doing business with you .
what is your offspring doing?
i need stamps .
can i have these?
no .
take them .
what's with the muumuu?
stop .
you couldn't find one made of metal , in case anyone has x ray eyes?
and now we say goodbye .
have michel look at your french paper before you go .
excuse me?
that would be great .
no .
come on , michel .
i'll tell all the ladies what a stud you are .
i believe that memo has already been sent .
please , michel .
pretty please with sucre on top?
i will stop talking like this .
leave it .
i'll look at it if i get a chance .
it's due tomorrow .
and pay special attention to the grammar .
i despise you .
when are you gonna let your parents know that you listen to the evil rock music?
you're an american teenager , for god's sake .
if my parents still get upset ... over the obscene portion size of american food ...
i seriously doubt i'm going to make any inroads with eminem .
i have to go to that .
the hayride?
you're kidding .
my parents set me up with the son of a business associate .
he's gonna be a doctor .
how old is he?
sixteen .
so he's gonna be a doctor in 100 years .
my parents like to plan ahead .
you have to go to the hayride with him?
and his older brother .
now you're kidding .
koreans never joke about future doctors .
i guess you're not going?
no .
i'm still fuzzy on what's fun about sitting in the cold for two hours ...
with a bundle of sticks up your butt .
don't expect me to clear it up for you .
for those of you who have not finished the final chapters of huckleberry finn ... you may use this time to do so .
for those of you who have , you can start on your essay now .
whichever task you choose , do it silently .
maybe it's a love letter .
or her diary .
could be a slam book .
it's the assignment .
nice , huh?
it's beautiful .
tell it to the tip jar .
take the bags up to 314 .
make sure the drapes are closed and there's extra soap ... and she wants her pillow mints now .
sookie !
i'm okay .
what did you do now?
why weren't you watching her?
no estabas cuidandola?
no .
she's this .
bad food in the head .
i need you to be more careful .
i know .
i'm sorry .
i fixed the peach sauce .
that's blood .
why are you bleeding?
my stitches opened .
i was using too much maple syrup .
it strangled the fruit .
when did you get stitches?
friday night .
radish roses .
okay , stop moving .
you gotta taste the sauce while it's still warm .
sookie , i need you to be more careful .
i need there to be fewer accidents .
dear god almighty , that's incredible !
i'll put it on the waffles tomorrow morning for breakfast .
i wanna take a bath in that sauce .
i will make more .
someday when we open our own inn , diabetics will line up to eat this sauce .
won't that be great?
the key to someday achieving that dream is for you to stay alive long enough ... so we can actually open an inn , you understand?
yes , i understand .
all right .
now let's get you up and to the doctor on three .
one , two , three .
what?
stepped on my thumb .
i'm fine .
on three .
okay .
was it a good color , at least?
it had sparkles in it .
and it smelled like bubble gum when it dried .
there's no way mark twain could compete with that .
mom , we're home !
did you hear something?
i'm not sure .
mom , are you here?
we're open .
everything's half off .
we have contact .
mom !
lane?
mom , where are you?
lane , where are you?
back here .
over here .
i think she's that way .
are we closer?
i'm by the table .
she's kidding , right?
look , we'll meet you in the kitchen .
what?
the kitchen !
who's that?
it's rory , mom .
i could hear the disappointment from here .
come on .
stop it .
it sucks that after all these years your mom still hates me .
she doesn't hate you .
she hates my mother .
she doesn't trust unmarried women .
you're unmarried .
i'm hayriding with a future proctologist .
i have potential .
go upstairs .
tea is ready .
i have muffins .
no dairy , no sugar , no wheat .
you have to soak them in tea to make them soft enough to bite ... but they're very healthy .
how was school?
none of the girls get pregnant , drop out?
not that we know of .
though come to think of it , joanna posner was glowing a little .
what?
nothing , mama .
she's just kidding .
boys don't like funny girls .
noted .
hello !
anybody here?
we're here .
we're coming .
have the muffins made from sprouted wheat .
only good 24 hour .
everything's half off !
where are you?
over here !
where?
by the chair !
what chair?
careful !
i'm okay .
peppers .
mike .
hello , little vegetables .
come with me .
i got it .
where's my glaze?
in the counter .
on the counter .
on , not in the counter .
okay , good .
all right .
my sauce .
that's pretty good .
hello .
a little bit of green .
okay .
hello , my little babies .
you like that?
a little bit of juice .
you're very pretty .
okay .
it's here .
it happened .
she did it .
i'm gonna need a longer sentence .
the chilton school .
rory got in .
oh , my god !
i know .
look .
we are happy to inform you we have a vacancy at chilton preparatory ... " " starting immediately .
due to rory's excellent credentials ... " " and your enthusiastic pursuit of her enrolment ...
i offered to do the principal to get her in . " ... we'd be happy to accept her once the first semester's tuition is received .
this is very exciting .
is something burning?
my bangs .
earlier .
go on .
she can finally go to harvard like she's always wanted ... get the education i never got , and do all the things i never got to do .
then i can resent her for it ... and we can finally have a normal mother daughter relationship .
mom?
you're happy .
yeah .
did you do something slutty?
i'm not that happy .
here .
what's going on?
open it .
i'm gonna be in a britney spears video?
you're going to chilton !
sorry .
mom?
you did it , babe .
you got in .
how did this happen?
you didn't with the principal , did you?
no .
that was a joke .
they have an open spot .
you're gonna start on monday .
really?
really .
i don't believe this .
my god , i'm going to chilton?
sookie , i'm going to chilton !
i'll make cookies .
protestants love oatmeal .
i have to call lane .
i love you .
i love you .
my girl's going to chilton .
yeah , i know .
rory's going to chilton !
michel , the phone .
it rings .
can you answer it?
no .
people are particularly stupid today .
i can't talk to any more of them .
you know who's really nice to talk to?
the people at the unemployment agency .
independence inn , michel speaking .
no , i'm sorry , we're completely booked .
i'm holding for miss bell .
i've been trying to get ahold of her all day .
lorelai gilmore .
hi .
yeah , my daughter rory has just been accepted .
thank you .
and i got the invoice for your enrolment fee .
that is a lot of zeroes behind that five .
okay , i guess what i'm wondering is ... if you couldn't take , say , part of it now , just to get her going?
but she's supposed to start monday .
it just doesn't give me a lot of time to pull a bank job .
never mind .
i was just kidding .
no , a bank job is robbing a bank , but ...
no .
i don't want you to give up her space .
i'll have to figure it out .
okay .
no , thank you .
it's been a real treat talking to you .
yeah .
bye bye .
what do i do?
you can have anything i own .
my car .
sell my car .
sweetie , no one wants your car .
there's something i haven't thought of .
there's something out there staring me right in the face .
i haven't seen it .
you might consider calling ...
no .
but i don't think you have ...
stop .
you can at least go and ...
okay , can i say one more thing?
i think it's your only option .
there are several chapters from a stephen king novel i'd reenact ... before i'd resort to that option .
okay , dropped .
thank you .
mom , so what do you think?
it makes you look smart .
okay , no more wine for you .
mom?
you look like you were swallowed by a kilt .
fine , you could hem it .
a little , only a little .
okay .
or i could hem it a lot .
no , i don't want it to be too short .
i can't believe tomorrow's my last day at stars hollow high .
i know .
today i was so excited , i dressed for gym .
you're kidding !
and i played volleyball .
with other people?
and i learned all this time i was avoiding group sports ... was very smart , because i suck at them .
you got that from me .
where's your pate?
at zsa zsa gabor's house .
i'm going to the store , because you have nothing .
do you feel like duck?
lf it's made with chicken , absolutely .
i'll be back .
bye .
all right , this will give you an idea .
go see how you like it .
okay .
i love being a private school girl .
hi , mom .
lorelai !
my goodness , this is a surprise .
is it easter already?
no , i just finished up my business class , and i thought i would stop by .
to see me?
yes .
isn't that nice .
come in .
thanks .
the place looks great .
it hasn't changed .
there you go .
how are the girls at the bridge club?
old .
good .
you said you were taking a business class?
yeah .
i'm taking a business class at the college twice a week .
i'm sure i told you .
if you're sure , then you must have .
would you like some tea?
i would love some coffee .
emily , i'm home .
we're in here .
hi , dad .
what is it , christmas already?
lorelai was taking a business class at the college today ... and decided to drop in to see us .
what business class?
she told us about it , dear .
remember?
no .
actually , i came here for a reason .
dad , would you mind sitting down for a minute?
you need money .
i have a situation .
you need money .
dad , just please let me get this out , okay?
rory has been accepted to chilton .
chilton?
that's a wonderful school .
it's only five minutes from here .
that's right , it is .
she can start as early as monday .
the problem is that they want me to put down an enrolment fee ... plus the first semester's tuition .
i have to do that immediately or she loses her spot .
so you need money .
yeah .
but it's not for me , it's for rory .
i intend to pay you back , every cent .
i don't ask for favors .
you know that .
yes , we know .
i'll get the checkbook .
thank you .
you have no idea .
thank you .
on one condition .
so close .
since we are now financially involved in your life ...
i want to be actively involved in your life .
what does that mean , mother?
i want a weekly dinner .
what?
friday nights , you and rory will have dinner here .
mom .
and you have to call us once a week ... to give us an update on her schooling and your life .
that's it .
that's the condition .
if you agree , you'll come to dinner tomorrow night ... and leave here with the check .
otherwise , i'm sorry , we can't help you .
i don't want her to know that i borrowed money from you .
can that just be between us?
does 7 : 00 work for you?
perfect .
and we get to wear uniforms .
no more people checking you out to see what you're wearing ...
'cause everyone's dressed alike in boring clothes , just there to learn .
okay , there's academic minded , and then there's amish .
funny .
thank you .
i told my mom you're changing schools .
was she thrilled?
the party's on friday .
i got to go .
i have to have a pre hayride cup of tea with a future doctor .
how do i look , korean?
spitting image .
good .
bye .
bye .
god !
you're like ruth gordon , just standing there with the tannis root .
make a noise .
rosemary's baby .
yeah .
that's a great movie .
you've got good taste .
are you moving?
no , just my books are .
my family just moved here from chicago .
chicago .
windy .
oprah .
yeah , that's the place .
i'm dean .
hi .
rory .
me .
that's me .
lorelai , technically .
lorelai .
i like that .
it's my mother's name , too .
she named me after herself .
she was in the hospital thinking about how men name boys after themselves ... so why couldn't women?
she says her feminism took over .
personally , i think a lot of demerol also went into that decision .
i never talk this much .
i better go .
sure .
i have to go look for a job .
okay , good .
you should check with miss patty .
what?
about the job .
you should check with miss patty .
she teaches dance .
she was actually on broadway once .
i don't really dance much .
no , she just knows everything that's going on in town .
she'll know if someone's looking .
great .
thanks .
what are you doing now?
nothing much .
i should throw this away at some point .
maybe you could show me where this miss patty's place is .
yeah , i guess so .
i really don't have anything important to ...
let's go .
have you lived here all your life?
yes .
pretty much .
i was actually born in hartford .
that's not far .
thirty minutes with no traffic .
really?
i timed it .
okay , then .
do you like cake?
what?
they make really good cakes here .
they're very round .
okay , i'll remember that .
good .
make a note .
you wouldn't want to forget where the round cakes are .
how are you liking moby dick?
it's really good .
yeah?
yeah , it's my first melville .
cool .
i know it's cliche to pick moby dick as your first melville , but ...
how did you know i was reading moby dick?
i've been watching you .
watching me?
not in a creepy i'm watching you sort of way .
i've noticed you .
me?
yeah .
when?
every day .
after school , you come out and sit under that tree , and you read .
last week it was madame bovary .
this week it's moby dick .
but why would you ...
because you're nice to look at ... and because you've got unbelievable concentration .
what?
last friday , two guys were tossing a ball ... and one guy nailed the other right in the face .
it was a mess .
blood everywhere , the nurse came out ... the place was in chaos , his girlfriend was freaking out ... and you just sat there and read .
you never even looked up .
i thought , " i've never seen anyone read so intensely before in my entire life .
i have to meet that girl .
maybe i just didn't look up because i'm unbelievably self centered .
maybe , but i doubt it .
did i ask you if you like cake?
yeah , you did .
'cause they have really good cake back there .
you were late getting home tonight .
yeah , i went to the library .
we're having dinner with the grandparents tomorrow night .
we are?
but it's september .
so?
so what holiday is in september?
look , it's not a holiday thing .
it's just dinner , okay?
fine .
sorry .
red meat can kill you .
enjoy .
i finished hemming your skirt today .
a grunt of acknowledgement might be nice .
why are we going to dinner tomorrow night?
what if i had plans?
you didn't even ask me .
lf you had plans , i'd have known .
how?
you would've told me .
i don't tell you everything .
i have my own things .
fine , you have things .
that's right .
i have things .
i had dibs on being the bitch tonight .
just tonight?
what the hell is wrong with you?
i'm not sure i want to go to chilton .
what?
the timing is just really bad .
the timing is bad?
and the bus ride to and from hartford , it's 30 minutes each way .
i can't believe what i'm hearing .
i don't think we should be spending that money right now .
i know chilton's got to be costing you a lot .
you've no idea .
your money should be going into buying an inn with sookie .
what about college?
what about harvard?
we don't know i can't get into harvard if i stay where i am .
enough of the crazy talk , okay?
i appreciate your concern , but i have this covered .
i still don't want to go .
why?
because i don't .
i have to get out of here .
we have to pay first .
one , two , three .
it's a waltz , ladies .
susie , do you have to tinkle?
then uncross your legs , darling .
rory , i think i found a job for your male friend .
what male friend?
they need a stock boy at the supermarket .
i already talked to taylor doose about him .
just send him around tomorrow .
okay , thanks .
what male friend?
he's very cute .
you have good taste .
hands in the air , not in the nose .
you'll have to walk faster than that .
you'll have to turn into frigging flo jo to get away from me .
this is about a boy .
of course !
i can't believe i didn't see it .
all this talk about money and bus rides .
you've got a guy , and you don't wanna leave school .
i'm going to bed .
god , i'm so dense .
it should've been my first thought .
after all , you're me .
i'm not you .
really?
someone ready to throw important life experiences out to be with a guy?
it sounds like me to me .
whatever .
who is he?
there's no guy .
dark hair , romantic eyes , looks a little dangerous?
this conversation's over .
tattoos are good , too .
i don't wanna change schools because of all the reasons ...
i've already told you a thousand times .
if you don't want to believe me , that's fine .
goodnight .
does he have a motorcycle?
if you're going to throw your life away , he'd better have a motorcycle !
i think that went pretty well , don't you?
thanks for the knock .
listen , can we just start all over , okay?
you tell me all about the guy , and i promise not to let my head explode .
rory , please talk to me .
okay , i'll talk .
don't get me wrong , guys are great .
i am a huge fan of guys .
you don't get knocked up at 16 being indifferent to guys .
babe , guys are always gonna be there .
this school isn't .
it's more important .
it has to be more important .
i'm going to sleep .
you've always been the sensible one in this house .
i need you to remember that feeling now .
you will kick your own butt later if you blow this .
it's my butt .
good comeback .
thank you .
you're welcome .
rory , come on .
i don't want to talk about this .
could you please just leave me alone?
okay .
fine .
we've always had a democracy in this house .
we never did anything unless we both agreed .
but now i guess i'm gonna have to play the mom card .
you are going to chilton whether you want to or not .
monday morning , you will be there .
end of story .
we'll see .
yeah , we will .
okay .
one , two ...
i swear i don't know what happened .
it's not important .
i've made that dish a hundred times .
it never exploded .
please forget it .
god , i killed a viking .
you should fire me or make me pay the cost of a new stove ...
out of my paycheck .
whatever you want .
i can't afford a new stove .
those things are expensive .
sookie , please , i am begging you , pull yourself together .
i got no sleep last night , and i think i put my contacts in backwards .
rory's still mad at you?
i'm not so crazy about her , either .
it was a fight .
mothers and daughters fight .
no , we don't fight .
we never fight .
you told me to tell you when your daughter arrived .
she's here , and she's sitting in my chair .
hold on just a minute .
and you are the one left standing .
life is a funny thing , no?
no muumuu today .
you know what's weird?
i kind of miss it .
you left me a note to meet you here .
i thought you might want to work a couple hours , make a little extra cash .
fine .
you're not gonna give me ... the mommie dearest treatment forever , are you?
you wanted me here , i'm here .
should i do something or what?
yeah , go home .
dinner's at 7 : 00 .
be ready to go .
fine .
fine .
my chair .
do we go in or do we just stand here reenacting the little match girl?
look , i know we're having a thing here , and i know you hate me ... but be civil , at least through dinner ... and then on the way home you can pull a menendez .
deal?
fine .
hi , grandma .
you're right on time .
yeah , no traffic at all .
i can't tell you what a treat it is to have you girls here .
we're excited , too .
is that a collector's cup , or can i throw it away for you?
in the kitchen , please .
sorry .
i want to hear all about chilton .
i haven't actually started yet .
richard , look who's here .
rory .
you're tall .
i guess .
what's your height?
5'7 " .
that's tall .
she's tall .
hi , dad .
lorelai , your daughter's tall .
i know .
it's freakish .
we're thinking of having her studied at mlt .
champagne , anyone?
that's fancy .
it's not every day i have my girls here for dinner ... on a day the banks are open .
to rory entering chilton ... and an exciting new phase in her life .
hear , hear .
let's sit , everyone .
this is just wonderful .
an education is the most important thing in the world , next to family .
and pie .
joke .
rory , how do you like the lamb?
it's good .
too dry?
no , it's perfect .
the potatoes could use a little salt , though .
excuse me?
so , grandpa , how's the insurance biz?
people die , we pay .
people crash cars , we pay .
people lose a foot , we pay .
at least you have your new slogan .
how are things at the motel?
the inn?
they're great .
lorelai's the executive manager now .
isn't that wonderful?
speaking of which , christopher called yesterday .
speaking of which?
how is that a speaking of which?
he's doing very well in california .
his internet start up goes public next month .
this could mean big things for him .
very talented man , your father .
she knows .
he always was a smart one , that boy .
you must take after him .
speaking of which , i'm going to get a coke .
or a knife .
hi , how are you doing?
i think i'm going to go talk to her .
no .
i'll go .
you stay and keep your grandfather company .
lorelai , come back to the table .
is it going to be like this every friday night?
i come over and let the two of you attack me?
you're being very dramatic .
dramatic?
were you at that table just now?
yes , i was .
you took what your father said the wrong way .
the wrong way?
how could i have taken it the wrong way?
what was open to interpretation?
keep your voice down .
no , mother .
i can't take it anymore .
tonight has been like a nightmare .
you're dripping all over the floor .
why do you pounce on every single thing i say?
that's absurd .
you've barely uttered a word all night .
that's not true .
you said " pie .
come on .
you did .
all i heard you say was " pie .
why bring up christopher?
was that really necessary?
he likes christopher .
isn't that interesting?
because , as i remember , when christopher got me pregnant ...
dad didn't like him so much .
you were 16 .
what were we supposed to do , throw you a party?
we were disappointed .
the two of you had such bright futures .
yes .
and by not getting married , we got to keep those bright futures .
when you get pregnant , you get married .
a child needs a mother and a father .
do you think christopher would have his own company now ... if we were married?
you think he'd be anything at all?
yes , i do .
your father would've put him ... in the insurance business , and you'd be living a lovely life right now .
he didn't want to be in the insurance business .
and i am living a lovely life right now .
that's right .
far away from us .
here we go .
you took that girl and completely shut us out of your life .
you wanted to control me .
you were still a child .
i stopped being a child the minute the strip turned pink , okay?
i had to figure out how to live .
i found a good job .
as a maid .
with all your brains and talent .
i worked my way up .
i run the place now .
i built a life on my own with no help from anyone .
yes , and think of where you would've been if you'd accepted a little help .
and where rory would have been?
but no , you were always too proud to accept anything from anyone .
i wasn't too proud to come here to you two ... begging for money for my kid's school , was i?
no , you certainly weren't .
but you're too proud to let her know where you got it from , aren't you?
fine , you have your precious pride , and i have my weekly dinners .
isn't that nice?
we both win .
mom?
i'm okay .
i just ...
do i look shorter?
because i feel shorter .
how about i buy you a cup of coffee?
you drive , though , 'cause i don't think my feet will reach the pedals .
nice dinner at the grandparents 'house .
yeah .
her dishes have never been cleaner .
you and grandma seemed to have a nice talk .
how much did you hear?
not much .
snippets .
little snippets .
so basically everything?
basically , yes .
the best laid plans .
i think it was really brave of you to ask them for money .
i so do not want to talk about it .
how many meals is it gonna take till we're off the hook?
i think the deli spread at my funeral will be the last one .
wait , does that mean ...
can't let a perfectly good plaid skirt go to waste .
honey , you won't be sorry .
you look nice .
really nice .
i had a meeting earlier at the bank .
they like collars .
you look nice , too .
i had a flagellation to go to .
what'll you have?
coffee , in a vat .
i'll have coffee also .
and chili fries .
that's quite a refined palate you got there .
behold the healing powers of a bath .
tell me about the guy .
you know what's really special about our relationship?
the total understanding about the need for one's privacy .
you really understand boundaries .
so tell me about the guy .
mom !
is he dreamy?
that's so nick at nite .
i'm gonna find out anyway .
really?
how?
i'll spy .
coffee .
fries .
i can't stand it .
this is so unhealthy .
rory , please , put down that cup of coffee .
you do not want to grow up to be like your mom .
sorry .
too late .
tell me about the guy .
check , please .
are you embarrassed to bring him home?
i'm not embarrassed .
does he talk at all?
no , mom , he's a mime .
