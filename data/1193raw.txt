warren wants to move|on it aggressively .
yes !
oh , oh , this is a good day, |this is a good day .
guys , did you know|that diamonds are about as common as taxis|on fifth avenue?
the value is entirely|sentimental , maintained by a supply , demand and advertising .
stripes .
now , delauer dominates|the world diamond market .
meaning if i represent them ,
i basically represent|the entire industry .
tell him .
what?
warren gave it to the judys .
spears and green |they're already on it .
no way !
yeah , well , you know, |he's kind of partial to hot , leggy chicks|for some reason .
yeah , and we're the , you know , the sneakers and beer division .
precious gems aren't exactly|our forte .
lips and hips are over at|a chick's magazine right now .
i got to get to warren|before they sink ...
you can't , you can't . |he's on a plane .
easy , pal . |the chicago meeting .
and it's too late an" yw" ay, |because warren's meeting them for drinks|at mullins 'tonight to discuss their ideas .
you know what? |this isn't happening .
you know why? |this was my tip .
it's going to be my pitch, |my account , my campaign .
this is my baby . | that's what i'm talking about .
they will not ace me|out of this .
that's right . | i heard that .
okay . |mullins ', tonight .
i heard that "?
oh .
hi . | hi .
l i don't really want|to talk about it , okay?
okay . | okay .
okay .
why does this always happen|to me?
things were going great|for , like , a week and a half , and then , all of a sudden, |it's over , and i am mystified .
seriously , i am mystified , because it always starts out|so well .
poor baby .
let's just roll with this one .
oh , mike and i had|such a connection .
the first time that we had sex , ... it was so beautiful ...
i cried .
you cried?
yeah .
you mean , like, |one glistening tear on your cheek , right?
no .
i was really emotional .
i even told him|that i loved him .
after how many days?
five .
two .
it was how i felt . |l wanted to express myself .
okay , well , what did he say?
oh , mike didn't have|to say an" yt" hing .
i know that he felt the same .
but then he started|getting really busy , and i didn't know where he was .
so i kept calling him|and calling him .
he was never home ...
you kept calling him?
i didn't leave a message .
he didn't know it was me . |my number's blocked .
oh , l i'm sure he thought|it was one of his friends .
you know , men frequently call their friends'|answering machines and hang up 20 times .
an" yw" ay ...
i'm too fat .
you're not fat ! | you're not fat !
oh , michelle , if the most|beautiful woman in the world acted the way you did , any normal guy|would still go running in the other direction .
oh , no .
no guy would go|running from you , andie .
you could barf all over him, |and he would say , " do it again .
that is both|incredibly disgusting and categorically untrue .
lf i did the things you did, |l'd get dumped , too .
okay , family , shoes off .
and breathe .
out .
okay , lori, |let's start with you .
well , the " botox for beginners" |piece is done .
now , it's a little scary, |but mostly upbeat .
now i'm on
what your gyno won't tell you , " which is also pretty scary , but , you know , upbeat .
i finished my research|on deadly pedicures , about the woman who contracted that fungus|from the unsterilized tools .
yeah .
it's a terrible story .
although , surprisingly ... upbeat !
marvelous .
what's next for| " 'how to 'with andie "?
well , i've been|working on something that's kind of different .
it's ...
it's a political piece, |and it's ...
no .
andie , you work at|" com" p" osure magazine .
we are fashion , trends , diets, |cosmetic surgeries , salacious gossip |that's " com" p" osure .
okay , but ... | look ,
andie , okay |the column is new for you .
when you turn it|into a must read , then you can write|about whatever you want .
until then , you can write|about whatever i want .
understood?
yeah .
michelle , what have you got?
i'm sorry , lana ,
i wasn't feeling very well ...
she got dumped .
oh , no ,
michelle ...
what a hellish ordeal for you .
but i must say, |you are looking fabulous .
are we loving the way she looks , all?
we love the way she looks . | oh , you are so right .
she looks great .
well , i haven't eaten|since the split .
good for you !
write about it .
i can't use my personal life|for a story .
i understand completely .
who will use michelle's|personal life for a story?
oh , i will .
go . | no , no , no ,
lana , with all due respect ,
lori has no business|mucking around in my personal life, |and i can't ...
i can't let her .
i am ... | i'll do it .
what?
i'll ...
i will ... |l'll sort of do it .
it's ...
you will be my inspiration .
for?
look at michelle .
she is a great girl , right? | yes .
an amazing woman .
but she has a problem|hanging onto relationships , and doesn't really know what she's doing wrong , which is like a lot|of our readers .
uh huh .
so , i was thinking that|l could start by dating a guy , and then drive him away , but only using|the classic mistakes most women , like michelle , make ... all the time .
i'll keep a diary of it , and it will be sort of a ... |dating " how to " in reverse .
what not to do .
yeah .
how to lose a guy in ten days .
yes .
go .
bart , what's new|in the shoe world?
wait , wait , lana , i'm sorry .
why ten days?
five days is too short, |and we go to press in 1 1 .
yes?
okay , what we found out is men are attracted|to purple shoes .
now , i love ...
maybe toss in something|spiritual as well .
who's that chic buddhist|richard gere cavorts with?
the dalai lama .
he's fabulous .
ah !
here's my 10 : 00 .
welcome .
hi .
ladies , judy spears|and judy green from warren advertising .
we're going to cook up|some fabulous tie ins for the fall .
jeannie ashcroft, |fashion and trends .
michelle rubin, |fitness and health .
excuse me .
hi .
and andie anderson, |our resident " how to " girl .
oh , i've seen|your column , andie .
what are you working on now?
oh , actually ...
how to lose a guy in ten days .
she's actually going|to start dating a guy , and then drive him away|in a week and a half .
sounds needlessly vicious .
it's going to be fabulous .
now all she has to do|is run along and find the luc" ky " guy . |go , go , go .
nice to meet you . | bye .
good bye .
ladies , come .
find the guy .
okay . | find the guy .
oh , you are never going|to pull this off .
watch me . |tonight , i'll hook a guy .
tomorrow , pull the switch .
before the ten days are up ,
i'm going to have this guy|running for his life .
you're not going to burn|his apartment down or bite him or an" yt" hing, |are you?
no !
i'm going to limit myself to doing everything girls|do wrong in relationships .
basically , everything|we know guys hate .
i'll be clingy , needy ...
yeah . | be touchy feely .
ooh , call him in the middle|of the night , and tell him everything|you had to eat that day .
what's wrong with that?
i'm kidding .
hello , ben .
what are you doing here?
phil , i'm here for|the meeting .
ladies .
but you weren't invited .
yeah , but i should have been .
i mean , it was my tip that delauer's shopping|for a new firm .
yes , it was , but i have|to think in terms of who's best suited|within the company team .
yes , sir , and that's me . |l want to handle this pitch .
ben , you sell joe blow better|than anyone else in my shop , but these girls sell luxury better than anyone else|in the business .
we have to put our best foot|forward on this pitch .
delauer would be|our biggest account .
yes , sir , they would .
annual advertising billings|of 50 to $60 million .
and i am the man that's going to bring this home|for you , phil .
why this place?
it's perfect .
hi , lngrid .
hi .
mullins 'is the apres work|watering hole for the upwardly mobile .
now , to date , the diamond industry|has always targeted men , sending the message|that the woman needs the man to buy her the rock .
all right , they say, |" a diamond is forever .
we say, |" a diamond is for everyone .
i like that . |yes .
we don't .
a diamond is for everyone " sends the message|that diamonds are everywhere , which means they're not rare, |and if they're not rare , they lose their status .
status is the reason to buy them in the first place , which benjamin would know|if he understood women , which you don't .
you can't feel bad about that, |ben .
no man does .
here you go .
thank you .
thanks .
oh !
sorry .
here .
here .
thanks .
dum , dum , dum , dum, |dum , dum , dum ...
hey , don't pressure her . |she's perusing .
yes , exactly .
hmm .
hmm .
selling a diamond to a woman is like making her fall in love .
she has to feel giddy, |desirous , adventurous , and desperate .
take a look around|this room , phillip .
most of the women in this bar|are looking for just that .
exactly .
the skills required|to market diamonds are the same as those needed to|make a woman fall in love , yes .
i'm not talking about lust .
a woman in lust wants chocolate .
a woman in love ... |wants diamonds .
yeah , i'm not talking about lust , either , ladies .
i'm talking about deep, |meaningful , head over heels, |his and her towels ,
let's grow old together, |l o v e.
look , i love women .
i do .
whether they're four , 40, |or my 88 year old grandmother ,
i respect women , all right?
and i also listen ... to women , and that's why i can sell myself|to any woman , an" yw" here , an" yt" ime .
make a woman fall in love|with diamonds , benjamin ... or with you?
eh , either one .
well , that's coc" ky " , ben .
no , not coc" ky " confident .
i'd like to see you prove that .
you would?
the agency's cohosting a party for the delauers|at the astor museum .
the party's a week from sunday .
do you think you could make a woman fall in love with you|by then?
ten days?
any woman , an" yw" here , an" yt" ime?
any single , available, |straight woman yes .
yes .
i'm not trying|to trick you , ben .
ln fact , we'll choose|a woman right here , right now , in this bar , and then you decide .
ooh .
so , who's the luc" ky " girl?
okay ...
let's see here .
ooh , there's that blonde babe|in the leopard print .
whoa , ho , ho !
she looks like fun .
be nice , ladies .
or ... wow ,
miss " babylon five .
now , she's on the prowl .
no .
her .
her who?
her , in the gray dress . |blonde hair .
pretty smile .
her?
done .
what?

see the guy next|to the horrible guy in the green shirt that i would|never even consider?
okay?
hmm ! | very cute .
right?
good . | all right?
here i go !
okay , you're on .
but here are the stakes .
after i win this bet , this pitch is mine .
agreed .
phil? | agreed .
you come to that party|with a girl that's really in love|with you , ben ... you can make the pitch|to the delauers .
but , phillip , you can't ...
i've made up my mind .
to the delauers .
to the delauers .
cheers . | cheers .
cheers .
mm mm . | mm mm .
i was just wondering|if you find ... ... exciting?

i'm going to make you wish|you were dead .
poor guy .
of all the women|spears and green could have thrown at me, |this one is amazing .
hanging with her for ten days|is going to be no problem .
right , so , it's only|nine days longer than you've ever spent|with any other chick , huh?
that's why i didn't go|for the gold immediately .
oh .
i'm taking my time .
it's a marathon , not a sprint .
ten days is a marathon?
okay , so it's more like|the 3, 000 meter hurdle .
the point is , she's already|on the ropes , guys .
wow , that that's a lot|of sports analogies .
that it?
that that's it? | that's it .
have you looked inside?
no .
do you have an ethical problem with rifling through|a woman's purse?
uh , yeah , i guess i do .
well , it's hardly a purse , dude .
it's more like a clutch|or something .
guys , a woman's purse, |all right it's her secret source of power . |all right?
there there are many dark|and dangerous things in there that we , the male species, |should know nothing about .
oh .
unless , of course , she , uh, |left it behind intentionally to secure a next day call back .
mm hmm .
she's a very clever minx .
oops , i'm sorry . |oh , god .
um ...
oh , shit, |we got to clean that up .
yeah , yeah .
carefully .
carefully .
oh , what have we here?
let us see , let us see .
oh ...
knicks tickets ...
huh . ... for tonight's game .
delivery , andie .
wow , look at those !
oh , who are those for?
andie , oh , my god !
where do you want these?
who are these to?
wait .
100 times ...
... more beautiful ...
wait . " ... than 100 roses .
catchy .
the guy's in advertising .
he can't help it .
so , does this mean he's hooked?
this means he found|the knicks tickets .
you left the tickets|in the purse?
yeah .
you are just on a whole|different playing field .
here you go .
mm hmm .
andie anderson .
hey , hey , pretty girl .
guess what?
i got a really embarrassing|display of white roses .
well , you are welcome .
listen , i had a wonderful time|last night .
i have your bag .
ah , i know .
i can't believe i left it there .
yeah , well , you must need it|back , what with all the cash , credit cards , and ... those knicks tickets|for tonight's game .
sounds like you've been|peeking through my bag , ben .
oh , absolutely not .
tony , my art director, |he's an oaf , and he accidentally|knocked it over .
ow , right !
yeah , i'm a clumsy man .
all right , i'm sorry , though .
i'm going to the game with somebody else .
not anymore .
besides , what?
you think you left your purse|at my place by accident?
no .
subconsciously, |you are dying to take me to that game .
denying your subconscious|desires is extremely dangerous|to your health , young lady .
does that psycho babble|really work on anybody?
you tell me .
andie , you're so bad .
all right , meet me|at the 7th avenue entrance .
7 : 30 .
don't be late .
you got it .
