the maintenance crews come in the tunnels by 6a . m .
i gotta be back in the hole by 5 : 30 .
as soon as the guards leave , you gotta tell me right away .
you can't be late .
i'm not worried about my end .
i'm wondering how you're gonna break that safe in half an hour .
you know , i mean

just physics .
how long is that gonna take?
twelve , fifteen minutes , tops .
fifteen minutes , tops?

you do anything out of the ordinary , you're gonna get made .
do you understand that?
be smart .
finish out your shift .
you're the boss .
okay .
steven got these from a supplier .
they're throwaways .
totally untraceable .
people are talking .
they say max is in trouble with teddy salida ... and he's pulling off a big job to get rid of him .
that's what they say?
maybe you should walk away from this one .
what are you doing down here?
jesus christ , you scared the shit out of me .
what the hell are you doing down here?
did you involve teddy salida in this?
what?
teddy salida?
yeah .
why would you say that?
i see these guys outside .
they look like they might be with him .
how much you into him for?
four million .
look , how do you think i got all this?
they gave it to me and the house in bermuda?
what's the matter with you?
what's he know?
about what?
about what we're doing .
nothing .
i told him i found something that would go for eight ... and that we'd split the profits , that's all .
what are you actually selling the scepter for , max?
$30 million .
jesus .
max , what were you thinking?
what was i thinking?
the same thing you were thinking .
how are we gonna get out from under all this bullshit we've been living?
the chance came .
took it .
it's gonna work out fine .
no , it's not .
what do you mean , it's not?
it's not .
it's a mess .
it's not gonna work .
wait .
wait a fucking minute .
this is absolutely clean , nick .
what are you worried about?
jesus christ , it's my ass on the line anyway , not yours .
i'm not taking the biggest gamble of my life ... so i can hand my money over to teddy salida .
you think you're not gonna get your fucking money?
look , there's two things you gotta know .
one is you're gonna get every fucking red cent .
and , yeah , teddy knows a little .
he knows?
he does a little , i said .
so you did lie?
yeah , lied !
shit happens , man !
christ almighty !
i lied for you and i lied for me .
i had to say something to get you to suit up , like always .
i'm sorry , but i'm not gonna do it .
it's a tiny door .
open the door .
take the shit .
close the door .
we're out .
there's too much bullshit around it .
what's that?
the buyer .
real simple .
you call him when you get the scepter .
he'll meet you at the airstrip 30 miles up the st. lawrence .
there's a little town called st. croix .
you give him the scepter , he gives you the cash .
you take your cut and you wire me the rest .
i'll give teddy his , and you're clean .
it's too risky .
can't .
you don't know what you're doing .
you know how long we go back?
twenty five years .
i'm gonna tell you something .
for the first time in my life , i'm scared .
i don't know why it is .
i was never scared before ... but i'm scared now , nick .
and you're right about teddy .
he's gonna blow me away if he can .
if i don't get him his money , he
man , he
hey , don't don't don't don't let me slide on this one .
i can't afford it , man .
i can't i can't scrap it out anymore .
i gotta have some slack .

a few cameras in the basement .
like we're gonna lose it , right?
lose what?
that thing in the piano leg .
the big gold thing?
some french national treasure .
it's called a scepter .
some expert saw those pictures .
now we're getting calls from the central office .
hey , it's me .
yeah , we got a problem .
they got a camera over the main door here , covering that .
they got a camera here , looking right across the middle .
they got one special just on the box ... sees this entire cage .
this camera looking at the box ... how high is it from the floor and how low is it from the ceiling?
probably 1 0 , 1 2 feet up off the floor .
four feet down from the ceiling .
i think we're fucked .
so let me
when i'm here ... you'll cut the feed when i get across here , then you'll restore it .
then when i'm ready here , you'll cut it again ... and i'll go to work here .
i don't know about that , man .
they know what it is so now they're gonna move it as soon as they can .
we're not gonna get another chance .
we gotta go now or we don't go at all .

montreal was stunned by the daring predawn robbery ... of the old city's historic customshouse .
a priceless scepter was stolen .
a senior night janitor ... identified this man ... as the prime suspect in the burglary .
he was spotted leaving the scene moments after the robbery ... and is now the focus of a massive manhunt .
a second suspect vanished from the scene without a trace .
police have no solid leads .
