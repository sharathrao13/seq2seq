dig !
somebody once wrote , " hell is the impossibility of reason .
that's what this place feels like , hell .
i hate it already , and it's only been a week .
some goddamn week , grandma .
boy , dig , dig !
the hardest thing i think i've ever done's go on point , 3 times this week .
i don't even know what i'm doing .
a gook could be standing 3 feet in front of me and i wouldn't know it .
i'm so tired .
we get up at 5 : 00a . m . , hump all day .
camp around 4 : 00 or 5 : 00 , dig a foxhole , eat , and put out an all night ambush or 3 man listening post in the jungle .
it's scary , 'cause nobody tells me how to do anything 'cause i'm new .
nobody cares about the new guys .
they don't even want to know your name .
the unwritten rule is a new guy's life isn't worth as much ...
'cause he hasn't put his time in yet , and they say if you're gonna get killed in the 'nam , it's better to get it in the first few weeks , the logic being you don't suffer that much .
if you're luck , you stay in the perimeter at night , and then you pull a 3 hour guard shift .
so maybe you sleep 3 , 4 hours a night , but you don't really sleep .
i don't think i can keep this up for a year , grandma .
i think i made a big mistake coming here .
we got beaucoup movement .
3o .
battalion just got hit 15 clicks north of here .
charlie had claymores strung up in the trees .
blew a whole fuckin 'platoon to pieces .
bad shit .
yeah .
they got 2 lieutenants and a captain .
jesus .
all right , sergeant , who do you want on ambush?
elias , you take your squad out .
warren , you stay in , but i'll need tex and junior from your squad .
roger that .
okay , move out in 2 0 mikes .
i thought it was o'neill's turn tonight .
no , no , no .
tubbs and morehouse are short .
fu shen is going on r & r tomorrow , and you wanna send them out on an ambush?
uh uh .
you got the fresh meat , buddy .
they don't know shit , barnes and chance are we're gonna run into something .
think about it .
what do you want me to do?
send 1 of my guys out to get zapped so some lame ass can get his beauty sleep?
nah .
hey , o'neill , take a break .
you don't take to be a prick every day of your life .
elias , get your men ready .
guy's in 3 years and he thinks he's jesus fuckin 'christ .
o'neill , your short timers stay in , but you go out .
i need veterans out there .
sergeant barnes?
sergeant .
i think , in front of the men , it's necessary for me to give the orders .
yes , sir .
looks like it's gonna rain .
it's gonna piss on us all night .
gonna put a serious case of crotch rot on that ugly face of yours , junior .
goddamn , man .
you break your ass for the white man .
no justice around here .
what's o'neill got , a nose up the lieutenant's ass already?
how come we always get fuckin 'ambush?
'cause it's politics , man .
politics .
hey , chris .
did i show you a picture of lucy jean?
no , you didn't .
she's the one for me , all right , that ...
lucy jean .
she's waitin 'for me too .
yeah , she's real pretty .
you're a lucky guy , gardner .
no .
you got a picture of your girl?
i guess that leaves some unluck girl back at home , don't it?
tuck this in .
shitcan this .
don't need this .
turn around .
come on .
tex , you got junior and taylor here on your position .
goddamn it , elias , don't mess with my pig .
i ain't gettin 'greased on this 'bush tonight .
so you keep this sorry cheese dick off my ass .

gardner , you're with me .
look , in case anything happens to you , you get lost or separated , don't yell out , okay?
okay .
just sit tight , and we'll get to you .
all right .
yo !
saddle up .
lock and load .
i come from alabama with my banjo on my knee and i'm going to louisiana my true love for to see
oh , susanna don't you cry for me for i come from alabama with my banjo ...
'course , mom and dad didn't want me to come here .
they wanted me to be just like them ... respectable , hard working , a little house , a family .
they drove me crazy with their goddamn world , grandma .
you know mom .
i guess i've always been sheltered and special .
i just want to be anonymous , like everybody else ... do my share for my country .
live up to what ... grandpa did in the first war and dad did in the second .
well , here i am , anonymous , all right , with guys nobody really cares about .
they come from the end of the line , most of them .
small towns you never heard of ,
pulaski , tennessee , brandon , mississippi ,
pork bend , utah , wampum , pennsylvania .
2 year's high school is about it .
maybe , if their lucky , a job waitin 'for 'em back in a factory , but most of 'em got nothing .
they're poor , they're the unwanted , yet they're fightin 'for our society and our freedom .
it's weird , isn't it?
they're the bottom of the barrel , and they know it .
maybe that's why they call themselves " grunts " ,
'cause a grunt can take it , can take anything .
they're the best i've ever seen , grandma , the heart and soul .
hey , taylor , hey .
cheese dick , you're up .
what?
you're up .
you sure you know how to work the claymores?
yeah , i'm sure .

3 times .
i got it .
and don't catch any z's on me , buddy , or i'll sling your sorry ass .
you hear me?
okay .
maybe i finally found it way down here in the mud .
maybe from down here i can startup again , be somethin 'i can be proud of without havin 'to fake it , be a fake human being .
maybe i can see somethin 'i don't yet see , or learn somethin 'yet know .
i miss you .
i miss you very much .

the motherfuckers .
the village , which had stood for maybe a thousand years , didn't know we were coming that day .

i didn't see anything , sir .
i did .
that dink was reported to me as n. v. a. by sergeant barnes , sir .
my report , sir , will include lieutenant wolfe ... as being witness to the shooting .
all right , elias .
staff sergeant barnes .
sir .
i want a full report from you on this when we get back to the c. p.
you got it , dai wee , and i can throw in plenty of eyewitnesses if you want , sir .
not now , goddamn it .
not now .
we'll get into this when we get back to the base camp .
and i can promise you something .
if i find out there was an illegal killing , there will be a court martial .
right now i need every man in the field .
and you two will cease fire .
staff sergeant barnes ,
sergeant elias , you hear me?
yes , sir .
yes , sir .
now , we're going back into that n. v. a. bunkercomplex tomorrow , this time from the east .

and that bunny?
that motherfucker's crazy .
i mean , he scares me , man .
he just scares me .
look .
you bloods are gettin 'too hung up on all this shit .
these gooks are a lot smarter than you think .
you know , barnes knows his shit , man .
they was n. v. a. , every last one of them .
now he's taken us this far , right?
he'll take us the rest of the way .
i don't know , homes .
i mean , a christian don't go around a village cutting off heads and shit .
shit is really getting out of hand , man .
it's blowin 'way out of control .
it seems to me that you don't seem to know the difference ... the way you shoot up that shit all the time .
i don't know , brothers , but i'm hurting real bad inside .
don't worry about it , sergeant .
elias won't be able to prove a thing .
i mean , he's a troublemaker , he ...
elias is a water walker .
like them politicians in washington trying to fight this war ... with one hand tied around their balls .
ain't no need or time for a courtroom out here .
sarge .
thanks , bun .
how'd it go there , bob?
yeah .
that away , sarge .
fucking elias , man .
he's a fucking rat , that's what he is .
he's gonna get everybody in this platoon in deep shit .
somebody ought to frag his ass .
so what do you think there , bob?
gonna be an investigation or what?
bob?
o'neill , man , you worry too much .
sarge will take care of it .
it's a beautiful night .
yeah , i love this place at night ...
the stars .
there's no right or wrong in them .
they're just there .
that's a nice way of putting it .
barnes has got it in for you , doesn't he?
barnes believes in what he's doing .
and you?
do you believe?
in '65 , yeah .
now ,
no .
what happened today is just the beginning .
we're gonna lose this war .
come on .
you really think so?
honest?
we've been kicking other people's asses for so long ...
i figure it's time we got ours kicked .
day by day ,
i struggle to maintain not only my strength ... but my sanity .
it's all a blur .
i've no energy to write .
i don't know what's right and what's wrong anymore .
the morale of the men is low ...
a civil war in the platoon , half the men with elias , half with barnes .
there's a lot of suspicion and hate .
i can't believe we're fighting each other ... when we should be fighting them .
counting days and the six inches in front of my face , not much else .
hope things are well , grandma .
tell mom and dad i ... well , just tell them .
chris .
hey , big boy .
i know you thought you had that laundry gig all laid out .
i gotta paint myself white just to get me one of them fuckin 'jobs .

are you joking me?
whose story do you think they're gonna believe?
o'neill's .
bunny's?
wolfe's?
bullshit !
you try that , and barnes will shove it right back up your ass ...
with a candle on it .
then what do you suggest we do?
i suggest , you all watch your own asses .
'cause barnes is gonna be comin 'down on all of them .
you just gonna forget about elias ... and all the good times we done had right in here?
shit , you're trying to cure the headache by cutting off his head .
elias didn't ask you to fight his battles for him .
and if there's a heaven ... and god i hope there is ...
i know he's sitting up there drunk as fuckin 'monkey and smokin 'shit .
'cause he done left his pains down here .
you're wrong , man .
any way you cut it , barnes is a fuckin 'murderer !
taylor ,
i remember when you first came in here , tellin 'me how much you admired the bastard .
i was wrong .
wrong?
you ain't never been right about nothin '!
dig this , you assholes , and dig it good .
barnes has been shot 7 times , and he ain't dead .
does that mean anything to you?
huh?
barnes ain't meant to die .
the only thing that could kill barnes ... is barnes .
you talking about killing?
y 'all experts?
y 'all know about killing?
i'd like to hear about it , potheads .
are you smoking this shit so's to escape from reality?
me , i don't need this shit .
i am reality .
there's the way it ought to be .
and there's the way it is .
elias was full of shit .
elias was a crusader .
now , i got no fight ... with any man who does what he's told . but when he don't , the machine breaks down .
and when the machine break down , we break down .
and i ain't gonna allow that ... in any of you .
not one .
y 'all love elias .
oh , you wanna kick ass .
yeah .
well , here i am , all by my lonesome .
and there ain't nobody gonna know .
6 of you boys against me .
kill me .
i shit on all of you .
you motherfucker !
come on , man .
go .
get him !
get him , chris .
easy , barnes .
don't do it , man .
you'll go dinky dau in l. b. j. , man .
10 years for killing an enlisted man .
10 years .
you'll climb the fuckin 'walls , man .
don't do it .
death?
what do you all know about death?
they sent us back into the valley the next day , about 2 . 000 m . from cambodia , into a battalion perimeter .
it felt like we were returnin 'to the scene of a crime .
alpha company had been hit hard the day before by a sizeable force , and charlie company hadbeen probed that night .
there were other battalions in the valley ... we weren't the only one ... but we knew we were going to be the bait to lure them out .
somewhere out there was the entire 141st n. v. a. regiment .
caught those motherfuckers trying to pull some shit on ...
charlie company last night .
they found maps on them , man .
got a friend at battalion .
says they had every fuckin 'fox hole here fixed on .
distances , tree lines , our claymores , everything .
this is bad man .
i got bad vibes here .
i also heard we're in fuckin 'cambodia right now .
cambodia?
man , you're kidding me .
you wanted to see me , sir?
yeah , ramucci .
looks like you got elias's squad now .
squad , sir?
i didn't know we were still referrin 'to this platoon in terms of squads .
all right .
look .
i want you to take those two holes .
right there and there .
you're tyin 'it off with barnes up here , king down there .
yeah .
begging your pardon , sir , my 2 holes are far enough apart ... you can run a regiment through them and never see it .
i got 5 live bodies left , sir .
look , i don't want to hear you problems , ramucci .
you'll get new men any day .
meantime , you make do like everybody else .
i didn't ask for this job .
i don't want to hear it .
oh , you don't want to hear it .
yeah , that's right .
i don't want to hear it , 'cause to tell you ... the truth , i don't give a shit , okay?
i just don't give a flying fuck anymore .
right .
i'm glad i ain't going with them .
somewhere out there is the beast , and he hungry tonight .
motherfuckin 'bummer .
10 days and a wake up , and i'm still dealing with this shit .
what's the matter with you , man?
how come you ain't writing nobody?
what about your folks?
that grandma you was telling me about?
girl?
you got a mother and father , don't you?
there must be somebody .
nah , there's nobody .
you've been smoking too much of this shit , troop .
gotta control that .
bring a man down .
i remember when you first come out here to the bush .
you were as green as a ...
did you ever get caught in a mistake that you just can't get out of , king?
there's a way out of anything , man .
just keep you pecker hard and your powder dry , and the worm will turn .
how many days you short?
nah , it's not just me .
it's the way the whole thing works .
people like elias get wasted .
people like barnes just go on makin 'up the rules any way they want .
so what do we do?
sit in the middle and suck on it .
we just don't add up to dry shit .
whoever said we did , man?
all you got to do is make it out of here , and it's all gravy . every day , the rest of your life ... gravy .
oh , shit .
super lifer .
hey king , collect up your shit .
your orders just come through .
oh , look , man .
don't fuck with me .
what do you need , a written invitation , for christ sake?
cocksucker !
oh , wow !

yes , sir .
sergeant o'neill .
how are you doing?
i'm just fine , sir .
well , that's good 'cause you got second platoon .
yes , sir .
you ready?
you bet .
i think now , looking back , we did not fight the enemy .
we fought ourselves , and the enemy was in us .
the war is over form e now , but i'll always be there ... the rest of my days , as i'm sure elias'll be , fightin 'with barnes for what rhah called possession of my soul .
there're times since ...
i've felt like the child ... born of those two fathers .
but be that as it may , those of us who did make it have an obligation to build again , to teach to others what we know , and to try with what's left of our lives ... to find a goodness and meaning ... to this life .
