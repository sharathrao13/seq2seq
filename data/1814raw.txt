4, 222 square feet , four floors . perfect .
courtyard in back , south facing garden .
perfect .
shouldn't we wait for the car service?
no , we'll sit in traffic forever .
is that the listing sheet?
there isn't one .
i heard about it this morning .
it'll be gone soon .
how many more?
none .
you know the market is tight .
sarah , do you have to ride that here?
mom , we're in the street .
evan !
one day you will learn to respect people's time , lydia .
you'll realize that the world does not stop and start at your convenience .
i'm so sorry .
i'm meeting arthur digby laurence in 26 minutes ... ... and if you think he's the kind of man who tolerates tardiness ... ... you are sadly mistaken .
you're a saint to wait for us .
thank you .
hello .
it's kind of between a townhouse and a brownstone .
we call it a " townstone " .
built in 1879 , this is the middle of the house , the parlor floor .
here is the living room .
formal dining is in the back .
casual dining below on the kitchen floor ... ... which was renovated in '94 with all the expected amenities .
sarah .
there are two bedroom floors above .
my god , it's amazing .
hey , kid .
no scooter .
i don't have to tell you this amount of living space is uncommon in manhattan .
it's got a yard .
sort of .
it is in a bit of disarray , but then again , 21 foot lot , 53 deep .
it allows for an expansive garden .
working elevator .
the previous owner was disabled the last years of his life .
highly unusual , the elevator .
you will not find this in 90 percent of brownstones .
perhaps it's something of a fixer upper , but we anticipate enormous interest .
it's a very emotional property .
shall we have a look at the rest?
you should make an offer immediately .
can i see it first?
there is nothing like this on the market right now .
you can't move from greenwich to the upper west side ... ... and expect to still have a house , a yard and a dog and cat , but here it is .
it's got everything you told me you wanted and more .
you'll have another family .
you could have two .
it's a fortune .
mom , it's not barneys .
you don't have to pay the price on the tag .
he can afford it .
it would be so lovely if i could show the property before i leave .
hardwood floors throughout , as many as six working fireplaces .
this is the top floor .
two bedrooms .
one at either end .
they share one small bath .
originally , this would have been the servants 'quarters .
the previous owner kept a small nursing staff .
i don't know if you have live in help .
no , it's just the two of us .
third floor , spare bedroom , den , or what have you .
mr. pearlstine used this as an office .
he's talking about sidney pearlstine , the financier .
may i ask what you do , mrs ....
altman .
actually , i'm going back to school .
columbia .
her husband's in pharmaceuticals .
i didn't realize you were stephan altman's wife .
yes , until recently .
master bath .
pearlstine's been in all the papers since he died .
his kids are suing each other over the estate .
he was a recluse .
rich , paranoid .
now they can't find half his money .
i hardly see how gossip is germane to showing the property .
stop calling it " the property " .
it sounds ridiculous .
walk in closet .
could the little one please stop that?
kid , no elevator !
and we emerge in the master suite .
that's strange .
what?
is this room smaller than it should be?
you're the first person to notice .
on caravan , no one from our office had the slightest idea .
it's called a panic room .
what?
a safe room .
a castle keep in medieval times .
i've read about these .
they're in vogue in high end construction .
one can't be too careful about home invasion .
this is perfect .
the alarm goes off in the middle of the night .
what will you do?
call the police and wait till tuesday?
traipse downstairs in your underthings to check it out?
i think not .
concrete walls .
buried phone line , not connected to the house's main line .
call the police , nobody can cut you off .
you have your own ventilation system .
a bank of surveillance monitors that covers nearly every corner of the house .
this whole thing makes me nervous .
why?
ever read any poe?
no , but i loved her last album .
what's to keep somebody from prying open the door?
steel .
thick steel .
very thick steel .
full battery backup , so even if the power's out ... ... it's still functional .
oh , my god .
old sidney didn't miss a trick , did he?
open it , please .
and with kids like he's apparently got , no wonder he wanted a place to hide .
please open the door .
that is highly inappropriate .
open the door , please .
my room .
definitely my room .
this is really dangerous .
that door is a hazard .
not at all .
motion detector , like an elevator .
the door won't close if it's blocked .
there's another one at your ankles .
it couldn't be safer .
i know they'll take asking price .
it's working .
i hooked up the phone !
good for you , mom .
hooked up a phone .
579 what?
3000 .
patsy's pizza . please hold .
hey .
enough .
mind the pizza?
what do you mean?
our first night .
i should've thought of something special .
i like pizza .
fuck him .
don't .
fuck her , too .
i agree .
but don't .
don't you think this place has way too many stairs?
you didn't carry anything up them .
you never asked what i thought of this house .
i didn't want you to tell me you hated it .
i liked our old house .
well , so did l .
you know what i was thinking?
i was thinking we could stencil the whole bookcase .
we could cut the stencils , do it ourselves .
go ahead .
oh , damn .
i forgot to set up that tour of your new school .
dad already did it .
i'm going with him on sunday .
oh , yeah?
so i'll take a cab and meet him there .
is that what he said?
isn't that what's so great about manhattan?
you don't have to drive me everywhere?
i'll ride with you .
why'd you bring me here if i can't go anywhere on my own?
that's it .
i quit .
i'm not fighting with you till tomorrow .
come here .
it's disgusting how much i love you .
tell me about it .
mom?
yeah .
it's too dark .
better?
that's better .
bypass non ready zone " .

we need to talk !
it's about time .

who the fuck is raoul?
raoul is okay .
raoul has experience .
where'd you get him?
through some people .

no shit .
what is this?
there's a girl on the top floor , a woman on the third .
they're asleep .
they're not supposed to be here .
this is your department , junior !
they are not supposed to be here !
videotape .
we're on videotape .
we've been on videotape since we got here and the tapes are upstairs .
14 day escrow .
you fucked me !
14 day escrow !
that's almost 3 weeks !
they should not be in for another week !
exactly how is 14 days three weeks?
business days .
escrow is always business days .
five day weeks always !
right?
i'm out of here .
just wait a minute .
wait a minute !
we can handle this .
can we still handle this?
it's just a woman and a kid?
unless daddy comes home .
he's not .
they're divorcing .
daddy's banging some b model on the upper east side .
it's just her and the kid !
now , can we do this?
yeah , we can do it .
not with people here .
and not with me .
wait !
twenty minutes !
she'll call the police .
they'll be here before i unpack my bags .
so , we keep an eye on her .
raoul can totally administrate that part .
i don't want raoul to administrate that !
he's not even supposed to be here !
nobody gets hurt .
what about us?
what if she has a gun?
who are you?
i'm raoul .
you know we can't do this without you !
this is still a good plan .
fuck that !
this is a great plan .
it's just got a slight twist .
yeah .
felony kidnapping .
thirty years .
you make a lot of promises , don't you?
you promise me , you promise your kids .
no family .
you're right .
it's all fucked up .
i fucked it up !
it's not how it's supposed to be .
but the fact of the matter is there's still $3, 000, 000 in this house ... ... and no one but you and i even knows it's here .
hey , i want that money .
i want it !
but you ... ... you need that money .
or have you forgotten why you're here?
so let's quit dicking around , okay , and get this over with .

nobody gets past !

i never hooked it up .
now what?
i can't hear a thing .
what do you think they want?
i don't know .
rob us ....
i don't know .
what do we do?
we wait .
what if they get in here?
well , they can't .
they can't get in .
it's not possible .
mom .
i heard you .
do you feel okay?
yeah .
you shaky?

don't worry about me .
he's got kids .
what do you think he'll do?
hang out while the cops waltz in?
use your head .
here he comes .
i locked the roof access .
she's not getting down from there .
good .
she could be in there calling the cops .
could she have hooked it up today?
no .
you don't just call up bell atlantic .
she would've had to do it through manhattan security , my company .
i checked the paperwork and the phone is not connected .
you see?
she couldn't have .
i thought she wouldn't be here .
he said she wouldn't .
fuck you !
and fuck you !
she is not supposed
do it .
excuse me .
the police are on their way .
she's lying .
you're full of
it's not an intercom .
it's a pa system .
i know .
i'm just scaring her .
i suggest you leave before they get here .
what?
he's saying that we don't have a phone .
how could he know that?
take what you want and get outi
if only it were that easy .
some paper .
i need some paper .
give me some paper .
hey , zorro !

you got a piece of paper?
what is he doing?
i don't know .
what we want is in that room "?
they're coming in here , aren't they?
no , no .
i told you .
they can't get in here .
what do you know about this room?
what do we know about that room?
let's not tell her anything .
just a few details .
we're not coming out , and we're not letting you in !

mom .
what?
get the fuck out of my house " .
get the fuck out of my housei
okay , i have an idea .
she's a woman .
women need security .
she won't believe you .
she needs to know she's dealing with decent people and she can trust us .
conversation's overi
what?
she's not coming down?
shut up .
will you please shut up and let me think?
like that'll help you think .
you know what?
fine !
you think !
what if she did call the cops?
she didn't .
she said it again , that she called the cops .
if cops were coming , do you think i'd still be here?
okay , fine .
good , excellent .
we all believe you .
how do we get into that room?
what is funny about this?
is this shit funny to you?
i spent the last 12 years building these rooms ... ... to keep out people like us .
it's all so ironic and amusing , okay?
now , how do we get in?
we can't .
you can't get in the panic room .
that's the whole point .
we have to get her to come out .
and why would she do that?
i don't know .
but when she does , she can't get out of this house .
we keep her here , we keep her quiet for 20 minutes ... ... and i don't want any help from joe pesci over here .
they want to hole up in this house?
fine .
we make it impossible for them to leave .
and why would they come out in the first place?
i'm working on that .
are you okay?
yeah .
small space?
i'm okay .
you can't wig out .
i know .
i mean it .
i won't .
you know , people never get buried alive anymore .
i guess it used to happen all the time .
really?
yeah , i read that .
and when did this happen all the time?
twenty , thirty years ago .
what are they doing now?
i don't know .
they're locking us in .
this is not happening .
sarah , calm down .
you know what could happen if you let yourself get worked up .
sarah !
what the hell are you doing?
we're coming in from below .
no , you're not .
even if you got through the concrete , there's steel .
you won't even make a dent .
we'll see .
hey .
this is what i do .
if some idiot with a sledgehammer could break in ... ... do you really think that i would still have a job?
don't get that in your eye .
neighbor .
help !
please help us !
call the police !
do you hear us?
help us !
help !
help us , please !
call the police !

they're going to get in here .
no , they can't get in here .
we're going to be fine .
we'll be just fine .
oh , this is good .
this could work .
i was just thinking that we should do something like this .
open it .
i just did .
open it some more .
we're just sending them a message .
they'll get the point .
honey , get down on the ground .
quit dicking around and open this fucking thing up .
don't be stupid .
quiet !
we're trying to scare them , not kill them .
what is it?
it's bad .
they're coughing .
if they're coughing , they're going to die !
nobody is going to die , man !
will you please have the balls to follow through with something?
mom .
the worst that'll happen is they'll pass out .
they'll have a hangover .
how are we going to get in there if they pass out , junior?
cut it back a little .
they won't pass out , numb nuts .
they'll throw up first .
we can't get in if they're dead !
stay on the ground and breathe .
turn it down .
turn it down !
it's too much !
don't you start up with this shit .
keep it down !
i'm turning it down .

half?
did you sleep through grade school?
five seconds ago , it was a third ....
come on .
i'm letting you know he's a problem .
but this wasn't my idea , so he's your problem .
you're right .
it wasn't your idea !
none of this was your idea !
it was my idea !
come on , look over here .

let's hope this guy's an ex boy scout .
we're here !
help us !
we're over here !

we're never going to get out of here .
i'm the loving grandson who put in the time with the old man ... ... every goddamn weekend for two years ... ... talking to him , dressing him , walking him , feeding him .
are you done?
no .
i'm the one the old man finally told about the safe .
i'm the one who found the guy who built it , and i convinced him to break into it !
wait a minute .
what?
the bedroom's empty .
where are they?
two of them , on the stairs .
where's the third guy?
i left my cell phone by the bed .
i earned that money .
i will not let you jeopardize my fucking plan ... ... because you have a problem relating to others !
got it?
if i don't come back , close this door .
just do what i say .
he touches me again , i'll shoot him .
christ !
wait !
any other schoolyard bullshit to settle , or can we get back to work?
don't take no tone with me , jerk wad .
i'll shove it up your ass and snap it off .
you're a bus driver , raoul .

no .
charger !
she has a cell phone .
no !

signal .
i don't think they'll be talking on no cell phone from in there .
why not?
you can't call out from in there .
no signal .
i didn't hook up this line , but i hooked up the main line .
if we can find it , we can cut into it .
i can't go to prison , man .
i'm not built for that shit .
be careful .
get the phone .
it doesn't come off .
rip it off !
screwdriver .
phillips .
junior , when i asked you to cut the phone lines , did you cut the main line?

he'll do something .
no , he won't .
he'll call the police .
you don't know her .
she won't let him .
no .
he knows that there's trouble .
he heard me .
he's across the park .
that's why we got houses close to each other .
just in case we needed each other .
he'll help us .
he won't .
yes , he will !
i'm sorry .
no , i'm sorry .
why?
i was trying not to tell you .
what?
i'm dizzy and hungry .
all she's got is nyquil and fucking midol .
looks like that gas idea didn't work so well .
whose fault was that?
this is impossible .
what's the plan now , hot rod?
this is worse than impossible .
this is unpleasant .
here , drink this .
all right , drink lots of water .
you dropped to the low 40s .
we have to get your blood sugar up .
can you hear me okay?
i'm just dizzy , not deaf .
great .
smart ass .
that's excellent .
did you see anything in here?
any candy bars or something sweet?
let's check it again .
mom , i did it .
we got to stay calm , okay?
if we stay calm , everything will be fine .
all right?
stay calm .
you're making me nervous .
i'm sorry .
what if i keep dropping?
you won't .
i'll figure something out .
you know , he's right .
there's no way we're getting into that room .
what are you talking about?
i just got to be honest with myself here .
i don't need to be involved ... ... with anything so harrowing or perilous at this point in my life .
you're giving up?
hell , yes .
i don't need the fucking aggravation .
i'll make an anonymous phone call .
they'll find the floor safe .
i'll inherit .
stephen , jeffrey , catherine , david .
five grandkids , 60 percent inheritance tax .
fuck , i'll still put away 8 or 900 grand and keep my goddamn hair .
take it .
go out and get loaded .
wait a minute .
say what you just said again .
say that shit about the money again , babycakes .
when?
before?
yeah , before .
splitting the money in your head , you said you'd put away 800 or 900 grand .
what are you doing?
that was after tax , which makes it more than a million and a half gross .
so now you're a tax attorney .
i'm out of here .
wait a minute .
there's sugar in everything .
places you'd never expect .
like ketchup .
where else?
travel kit .
plus , you named eight people you got to split it with ... ... so that's 10 or 12 million bucks in the safe .
a fuck up like you has got to get less than everybody else ... ... so now i don't know what to think .
you're adding up money you'll never touch , buddy .
how much is in there?
mouthwash .
saccharin .
hey , i'm talking to you .
answer me .
fine .
there's more .
and when were you going to tell us this minor economic detail?
it doesn't matter now .
it's totally fucking moot !
why are we having this conversation?
what were you thinking?
how did you expect to get away with this?
did you think that i'd open that safe ... ... and then me and raoul would wait while you picked out your share?
what's the matter with you?
you got us into this mess , and you were going to fuck us?
you got yourself into this .
you got the custody lawyers up your ass .
your eyes were huge when i told you about the gig ... ... so don't play innocent .
things didn't work out .
play past it .
mints?
sugar free .
mints?
sugar free .
i'm opening that safe .
you leave , you get nothing .
it's looking doubtful there , big guy .
i will split the money with raoul .
but i don't ever want to see you again .
cops show up on my doorstep , we will know who sent them ... ... and we will fucking find you .
i'll see you , burnham .
later , raoul .
mom !
ride in a town car to 125th street a couple of times ... ... think you know all about it .
you don't know nothing about me .
go to the corner .
shut your eyes and don't turn around .
okay .
you should see the look on your face .
what's happening?
don't move .
don't you fucking move .
no , don't .
come here .
come here .
don't shoot , please .
come on .
shut it , lock it and get the fuck away from it .
stop it , you fucking  fucking what?
clown?
idiot?
fucking asshole?
who's the clown now?
me .
that's right .
it's burning me .
who's got the gun?
you .
remember that .
find out who the fuck that is .
give me your wallet .
give me your wallet .
stephan altman .
did your wife give you a call , stephan?
what did she say?
don't know .
cut off .
phones are dead .
did you call anybody else?
did you call the fucking cops , stephan?
no .
he's telling the truth .
yeah .
yeah , he probably is .
because when i do this , people don't lie .
what?
what do you want?
get us into that room .
i can't .
yeah , you can .
you're full of ideas .
you just got to squeeze one out .
you want me to just make something up?
you've got till the count of three .
then you end up like junior over there .
one , squeeze .
this is ridiculous .
two , squeeze .
i don't know what to tell you .
three .
