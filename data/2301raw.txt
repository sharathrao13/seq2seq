i walk home ...
i'm aii scratched up , i've got blood aii over my face ...
i'm crying my eyes out .
my mother sees me and she runs up screaming , " who did this to you?
i teii her , " stevie beilon jumped me from behind in the schooi yard ... while his pals stood there and made sure no one broke it up .
so take a guess what my mom does?
she takes me back to the schooi yard ... she finds stevie and teils him that i'm gonna fight him again ... only this time it's gonna be affairfight .
your mom booked yourfight .
weil , me and stevie , we stood there iooking at her ...
iike she was waiting for us to make up or something .
then she puils me aside and iooks at me ... and teils me to rip his heart out .
she said , " rip his heart out " to an eight year old?
and?
and i got him pretty good .
your mother just stood there and watched?
once things were evened up , she puiled me off of him .
good foryour mom .
i salute her .
if more parents took those steps during child developmentai years ... we wouldn't have a country fiiled of emotionai cripples ... those touchy feely , angst ing head cases afraid of their own shadows .
exactly .
i say " buck up , baby .
it's cold outside .
i think it's time for a cab home .

of course i can .
no , you cannot .
he was a voice , some computerized echo chamber .
if he's in the credits , he counts .
he wasn't even on the set when they were shooting the movie .
come again?
bet you any money he was in malibu the whole time ... sipping pina coladas by the pooi with some 17 year old girl .
james eari jones?
while some poor slob was sweating his ass off underthe costume .
afew months iater , he throws his voice and walks out with a check .
you're a cook in a restaurant , right?
i wondered if you'd been invited to any james eari jones 'pooi parties .
i may not be in the movie business ... but i have cable .
i know what a stand in's for .
they're cailed " doubles " .
same difference .
no darth vader .
the only rule to the game is the guy appears in the credits .

he's been in about fifty movies .
give me a second .

you told me .
don't be a sore ioser .
i'm not sore .
don't worry , tom .
i'm gonna do whatever it takes not to iet this siily i. q. thing ... get in the way of our new friendship , aii right?
people can be cruel ... to people inteilectuaily chailenged , such as yourself .
i don't know your daily struggles ...
iike trying to figure out which shoe goes on which foot .
aii right .
you give?
i give .
you give?
i give .
you give up too easy .
i was being nice .
i didn't want you to feei inadequate afterthe mentai bashing i gave you .
you know , how much can one person take in one night?
thank you forthe compassion .
it's my fatai flaw .
compassion?
ijust can't stop giving .
and that's a flaw?
weil , people can take advantage of ...
you have reaily beautifui eyes .
i need a ...
i want a drink .
do you want a drink?
i've got some scotch .
drink?
i've got beer .
do you want a beer?
do you have a boyfriend?
no , i have beer .
do you have a girlfriend?
no , i don't .
shit , you're married .
no , i'm not married .
so what's the problem?
what do you mean , there's no problem .
you didn't just notice the sudden change of subject occur?
can we just talk some more?
talk .
ijust ... i need a few more minutes with this .
have you ever been with a guy before?
teii the truth .
i am .
it's totaily cooi if you haven't .
weil , i have .
it's actuaily sort of a turn on if you haven't .
weil , i have .
i'm a iittle nervous .
so am i.
you're nervous .
i'm serious .
i may be a iittle slow with aii this ... you don't come off as a rookie to me .
look ...
i can't ever remember making a move iike that .
i'm usuaily " a big scared cat " , seriously .
you don't seem it .
weil , i guess i'm good at hiding it , then .
you are .
weil , it's just you're easy to be with , you now?
that doesn't happen every day .
i guess i kind of went with it .
i got a sudden burst of courage , that's now quickly disappearing .
so you don't mind if we talk for a iittle while?
that'd be great .
i'm gonna get us a couple drinks .
how iong have you iived here?
i iike your place .
it's funky .
can i ask you something?
what?
i don't want to say anything you might take the wrong way .
what is it?
how many men have you been with?
just teii me it's none of my fuckin 'business .
it's none of yourfucking business .
right .
i'm playing with you .
relax .
so , how many men have you been with?
weil , not a iot .
how many is " not a iot "?
whatever most people today consider a iot , it's iess than that .
less than a iot .
what about more than messing around?
sex is a very intimate thing .
it's the most intimate two people can be with one another .
and it's not something i feei right about with just anybody .
there has to be a certain trust a certain bond with that person .
nice observation .
yeah , it is for me .
i'm starting to think that because i made some siily move ... you now have this idea about me?
maybe i misread things .
maybe .
maybe .
so how many men have you been with?
ijust told you .
no , no .
you said you needed trust .
you said " trust " .
doesn't that say it ail?
not reaily .
i know the exact number of men i've been with .
most people don't orthey can't keep track , but i do .
if you don't want to teii me , or ...
six .
six , just iike that .
six , just iike that .
we are talking about intercourse?
okay , weil , then , six .
no way it could be seven?
is it possible there is seven?
i guess , but no more than seven .
no way .
it could be seven but not a chance there's eight?
what is this?
isn't this usuaily done by a guy named " rocco " ... with a hot iamp in my eyes?
i'm sorry .
i'm sorry .
i'm getting aii carried away .
this is your personai business .
i'm being an asshole .
give me one second ... and i'ii teii you precisely how many men i've done that with .
seven .
seven .
exactly seven .
how's that , " lieutenant columbo "?
what about you?
one .
one?
reaily?
so , what was it , a one night stand , a good close friend?
do you screw aii eight of them or did they screw you?
you're being siily and i told you it was seven and not eight .
we don't have to play this twenty questions game .
if you want to know if i'm safe just ask me .
are you safe?
very .
that's a strong word .
the simple truth is , i don't ever do anything that's unsafe .
the truth isn't that easy .
the truth is confusing .
weil , what's so confusing about it?
everybody has their own truth .
and you got yours , i've got mine .
but the only truth that matter is the " true truth " .
not what you say ... or what i say but what reaily is .
sometimes it isn't easy to figure out .
what was the truth foryou , what ijust did there?
you took a drink from the bottle .
and that would be a iie .
i took the bottle to my iips but i didn't drink anything .
see , the truth is confusing .
i think the " true truth " is , you're bombed .
i think we've done enough talking fortonight .
you're gonna take advantage of my drunken state?
is that what you want?
i definitely have to get drunk or i wouldn't be able to do this .
you don't have to do anything you don't want to do .
what is it you want?
i want ...
i need to take a piss .
stay right there , okay?
you're very iucky .
why is that?
if i wasn't so horny , i would have been out that doorten minutes ago .
i'm totaily kidding .
no , you're not .
you're right , i'm not .
heilo , my iove .
you're stiii awake .
i caught my second wind .
you're up reai iate for a schooi night .
hey , did you try and ieave a message?
it doesn't sound iike you're stiii at winston's .
isabeila , don't give me a hard time .
is it the guy we were talking to , the cutey with the green eyes?
yes , the cutey .
is he cute rich guy?
he's a cook .
he iives at ninth and " a " and from the iooks of his place ... if he is rich , he's done a splendid job of hiding it .
but he is a cutey?
yes , he is .

dan , can you hear me?
yeah , nine , i got it .
i'ii caii you tomorrow .
who was on the phone?
i was checking messages .

why do you say that?
because i've been here before .
how can you be so sure?
this frog ... it's cracked .
so?
i broke it .
i broke this .
i knew this place seemed familiar .
wait a second ...
ijust wasn't sure .
it was dark and i think ...
i was stoned or something ...
you were drunk , dan .
you weren't stoned .
how do you know?
don't teii me that was you .
was that you?
yeah .
oh , my god , that was you .
wasn't that , fouryears ago?
five .
weil , i didn't even ...
so , how have you been?
when did you know that it was me?
the moment i saw you .
the moment you saw me .
and you didn't say anything .
i wanted to see if you'd remember me .
i mean , it was five years .
and you were drunk .
i was very drunk .
you don't remember anything?
i remember breaking the frog .
what about us?
weil , i remember we ... we had a good time , we had fun .
fun?
yeah , we had a iot of fun .
so you don't remember anything?
no , ijust ... don't say that , you know?
it's aii right .
no , wait a second .
we met at winston's , iike we did tonight , right?
i got it now .
we came back here ... we sat down on the couch and i unbuttoned your shirt .
and then we started kissing ...
i had a puilover , no buttons .
same thing .
teii me more .
more what?
details .
our details .
teii me everything you remember about our night .
why?
i iike hearing it .
start with my shirt .
it came off and then what?
i took off your shirt and i kissed down the back of your ear .
no , that never happened .
excuse me?
that never happened .
you kissed the back of my ear ...
it was five years ago .
who can remember every detail?
i can .
i remember every minute .
you didn't break that thing , i did .
i broke it ... when i was taking off my sweater my blue , striped sweater .
i don't know what to say .
i'm sorry .
i'm sorry , i don't remember .
and now i'm realizing it was yourfirst time ...
my only time .
i must reaily iike you ... to have gone home a second time without remembering .
this isn't gonna happen tonight .
i should probably go .
i reaily sorry .
it's not opening .
you need a key .
what?
you need a key .
thanks .
wait a second .
i'm just curious about one thing .
i'm not curious , i'm confused .
about what?
i don't know how to put this .
just put it .
if you don't remember that night ... then why did you teii me you were safe?
i'm sorry , " very safe " .
open the door .
answer me .
open the door .
i wiil .
open the door now .
just teii me why you said that .
because i'm always safe .
but you don't remember .
you said , " i don't remember " .
i said i don't remember every detail ...
i don't have to remember being safe .
i'm always safe .
always .
always .
now is that the " true truth " or is that yourtruth?
god damn it !
they don't work !
these don't fuckin 'work , man !
shit .
i gave you the wrong set .
i'm sorry .
i screwed this up .
i didn't mean to get weird .
it's just when you didn't remember me ... that being my only time ...
i got embarrassed .
maybe even a iittle pissed off with the booze .
the booze has a way of being an asshole when i'm hurt .
just open the door , okay?
can i have a hug before you go?
i should ieave .
just one hug so there's no bad feelings .
i should ieave .
i didn't mean to get weird .
unlock the doorfirst .
you should have ieft .
why didn't you just ieave?
the door has a dead bolt which i iocked from the outside .
the windows are boarded up .
the next door neighbors are aii away with the family .
the apartment downstairs is empty .
if you fight me , it wiii hurt .
stay stiil .
try and stay stiil .
is there a problem?
is there something burning in there?
i overcooked a steak .
it's aii right .
ijust need to open a window .
it's aii right .
you're sure?
yeah , it's fine , thank you .
thanks forthe concern .
i'm not crazy .
i know what i did and i know why i'm doing it .
i want you to know that .
i'm not crazy .
i don't care why you did what you did ... what you gotta do right now is iet me go .
my roommate knows where i am .
remember isabeila from the bar?
when i was getting the messages , she picked up .
i told heryou iived on ninth and monroe .
now , when i don't come home tonight ... and i miss my very important meeting in the morning ... she's gonna wonder where i am , she's gonna knocking on your door .
there's a big difference between teiling her i iive on ninth street ... and teiling her i iive at 453 east ninth street .
i told her453 ninth street .
i mead a mentai note when we walked inside the building .
four five three .
she knows exactly where i am .
you should start writing things down .
we're in building 412 .
what do you want?
dan , have you ever been tested forthe alds virus?
what?
hlv , alds , you've heard of it?
of course .
have you ever been tested?
have you ever been tested?
as you know .
are you ...?
i'm positive and you gave it to me .
i knew it'd be iike this .
you say " no " , i say " yes " , which ieaves us in the same place .
the blood i took is being tested at a very reliable iab .
we'ii have the result the morning after next and we wiii go from there .
go from there?
if it's negative , then i'm sorry , and i wiii iet you go .
you're sorry?
this wasn't an easy decision .
it's not even a decision .
it's a way to set things right .
weil , i've been tested and it was negative .
when?
two months ago .
i've been tested three times in the iast five years .
that's a iot of tests .
i told you , i'm very safe .
it is what you told me .
it couldn't have been me .
this isn't something you can talk your way out of , act aii smug .
caii my doctor .
you ask him .
i can't give you something that i don't have .
i can't give you something i don't have !
if your doctortold me that you were negative ...
i would teii him to go fuck himself !
we're waiting on the iab !
i'm compassionate to your situation , but i don't have alds .
i don't have hlv .
then you'ii be out of here soon .
soon enough isn't good enough .
i want out of here now !
now !
shut up fucking now or i'ii cut yourthroat right fucking now !
you understand me?
i could be a reai fuck and did one of those do it yourself hlvtests ... but you deserved something more dependable than a ten doilar kit .
do you realize the ionger you keep me here ... it's just making it worse on yourself?
do you realize that?
now you've got me worried .
this isn't right .
tough to be held accountable , isn't it?
held accountable?
we fooled around 5 years ago .
what do i have to be held for?
you teii me .
you couldn't teii me earlier what we did .
maybe you could teii me now?
you've got no idea , do you?
you have no idea what we did or what we didn't do .
weii you're responsible for what you did .
you've got no clue .
i may not remember what color your goddamn shirt was ... but one thing i am certain about is that i wore a condom .
you were blind drunk .
you have no recoilection of me , but somehow you remember a condom?
i don't have to remember wearing it .
i always wear one .
you iie with such confidence .
i'm impressed .
but i'm not iying , am i?
am i?
yes , there was a condom .
you had one .
did you use it?
given the circumstance , i'm guessing you didn't .
where the fuck where are you getting this?
maybe it didn't feei good so you slipped it off halfway through?
maybe at the iast minute you decided not to put it on?
i would never do that .
never .
how you would neverfuck anyone without having that certain trust .
and why do we need that trust?
you never " feei right about doing an intimate thing with just anyone " .
that was you who said that .
i wore a condom .
end of story .
weil , considering one of us is hlv positive ... and the other is having a great deai of difficulty remembering ... the iast iie they told two minutes ago ...
i got serious doubts about where that rubber ended up ... and serious doubts about you .
you tie up aii the other guys you've been with?
there were no other guys .
women?
you don't think you can get this from a woman?
you think the only people who have this disease are gay men?
wait a second !
you got this from a woman .
you got this from a woman , now you're trying to blame me for it !
you are sitting there because you are the only possible reason ... why i am here doing this .
the only reason .
i want to see some proof .
you want to see some proof .
what the fuck are you talking about?
they gave you something to teii you that you got it .
didn't they?
they don't give a membership card .
i'm starting to think you don't have shit .
you made this alds story up .
and why would i do that?
because you're pissed because i fucked you ... because you iike men ... orthat maybe this turns you on , is that it?
or maybe you're just fucking crazy?
you want to know something?
i wish you were right .
i wish it would end tomorrow .
and i'm not here to torture you .
i don't want to make this any worse than it has to be .
you can pass the blame around forever but we don't have forever .
we need to do the right thing .
what is that?
what is it?
is that you?
when the heii did that happen?
about four hours ago .
why didn't you wake me up?
believe me , i tried .
you're a deep sleeper .
weil , once is not enough .
it's no wonder who could hear anything overthat incessant snore .
i have a deviated septum .
my snoring is a medicai condition .
whatever .
you know what , can we just ... can we take care of this?
it's been a iong night .
just give me a wash cloth and some clean clothes .
no , i can't do that .
you can't?
no , i can't take the cuffs off .
i'ii be five minutes .
no , i can't do it .
what is this " can't " business?
the cuffs stay on !
i'm asking for a wash cloth , not a gun .
i'm sitting in shit .
i'ii figure something out .
what's there to figure?
are you gonna do it?
no , i'm not gonna do it .
if you're not gonna do it and i can't do it with hand cuffs on ... that doesn't ieave us with a iot of options , does it?
give me a second .
you should have had this covered .
weil , take points off .
it's not my career !
what , did you expect me to hold it aii night?
you take someone hostage and their bodily functions just stop?
sure , you thought of the tape and the hand cuffs ...
and the board on the window ...
shut up , shut up .
i wiii take off the cuffs , you don't move .
i take off the cuffs , you don't move .
you want to ieave the toilet in there?
i step outside the bathroom and i shut the door , you don't move .
you don't move unless i say move , you understand?
i got it .
put your dirty clothes in the garbage bag ... you take a shower , you towei off ...
how's it going in there?
put on your clean clothes .
you take your chair and you put it in the tub .
you iie face down on the floor with your hands behind your back .
again , you do not move .
i wiii come to you ...
i wiii cuff you and i wiii take you out .
you're iying face down , on the floor with your hands on your back .
now , i've never been in your situation before .
it wiii be impossible foryou not to think of a way out of this .
and i understand that .
it's human nature .
but it's acting on these thoughts that wiii iead to trouble .
are you on the floor?
is yourface down?
and your hands?
on my back .
you're iying face down on the floor with your hands on your back?
teii me where the keys are .
where's the fuckin 'keys?
pocket , rear pocket .
it's done , it's finished .
move aside .
move !
i'ii fucking kiii you if i have to .
i have a fucking knife , tom .
aii right , you're gonna die .
i'm gonna drive this right through you .
is that what you want?
is that what you want , you want to die?
i'm gonna drive this thing through yourfuckin 'heart .
how many years you thought i was gonna make today?
lunch smeils good .
what are we having?
come on , are you stiii mad at me?
i'm a hostage .
you gotta expect that sort of behaviorfrom us .
what do you expect me to do?
what would you have done?
you don't have to hold a grudge over it .
also considerthat i could have strangled you with the tv cord .
you should be thanking me .
so , did you decorate this place yourself?
my granddad's place .
so he iet you use it for speciai occasions .
one night stands , kidnappings?
he died ten years ago .
the family kept it .
how much do you pay rent?
trying to watch the game in here .
i'm watching the game .
which team you rooting for?
you want me to put the tape back on your mouth?
i was just asking a question , man .
besides , you haven't fed me yet .
i went to the university of michigan .
we've got a great athletic program .
footbail , basebaii and basketbail .
reaily?
you're being sarcastic .
what's michigan's nickname?
i'm just gonna take your silence to mean that you ...
wolverines .
wolverines .
what are the team colors?
blue and yeilow .
wrong .
it's " maize " .
it's not yeilow , it's " maize " .
it's a pale yeilow .
corn ish " .
so , you're one of those sports guys .
you know aii the stats .
you think there's something wrong with that?
not enough brain space , maybe?
i'd say it's enough wasted space that it takes to know ... that teily savalas had a smaii role in the originai " cape fear " .
i was a huge sports fan when i was at michigan .
the best were those saturday afternoon footbaii games .
the whole school , the whole town ... would just get pumped up iike , about three hours before .
we had barbeques in the parking iot ... turning out pep railies .
touch footbaii on the iawn .
i never understood the whole sports thing before i got to ann arbor ... but once i was there , i was hooked .
during the iast year , i actuaily what they were doing on the field . punting , first down conversions ... quarterback snoops ...
sneaks .
it's " quarterback sneaks " .
it's completely different when you realize why you're cheering .
without a doubt the highlight was the iast game , senioryear .
ohio state was driving down the field forthe win ... and everyone was screaming at the top of their iungs ... but it was aii over the place , you know?
it was iike , a " let's stop 'em " from this group ... and a " go , wolverines " from that section .
that's just ... here was no unity .
i stood up , and ijust started yeiling .
defense !
defense !
defense !
i stood there for a iong time before i sit back down .
and then it started .
it was iike a hundred people in my section .
and then it turned into a thousand .
and then it was ...
defense !
defense !
defense !
defense !
a hundred thousand fans screaming at the top of their iungs .
it was pretty cool .
what about you?
did your coilege have a pretty good footbaii team?
where'd you go to coilege?
no , we're not gonna do this .
do what?
maybe removing the tape for some water gave you the wrong idea .
we're not two pals sitting here watching the bailgame .
i thought , i was just trying ...
i'm not an idiot .
i know that .
it's not gonna work .
look , ijust want ...
it's not going to work .
ijust want to talk .
just talk .
it could be as simple as me putting the tape back on your mouth .
aii right , please don't .
i'ii shut up .
you said that you don't want to torture me , you rememberthat?
weil , if you reaily meant it , then ... you got to talk to me because ... just iet me babble at something , because ... if you just iet me sit here in silence ...
i ieft only to think about this ... then that would be cruelerthan anything you could ever do to me .
did you stop them?
footbaii cheer , ohio state .
did you stop them?
no .
they threw a forty yard touchdown pass .
they went to the rose bowl .
and we went to the " heinz ketchup bowi in missoula " .
so where'd you go to coilege?
i did two years at liberty community coilege .
liberty they had a good reputation .
liberty's got a great science department .
you heard about that?
one of the best science departments in the country .
in the world , in fact .
that's where nasa gets aii of their astronauts ... from they're aii liberty coilege graduates .
i got good grades in high school .
i didn't have to go to liberty .
it was in the neighborhood .
in the neighborhood of saint pete's .
that makes sense .
does it?
you get iost at those big schools ... you get a better education at the smailer ones .
michigan was just one iong party .
reaily?
i was eighteen , on my own ... practicaily my first time out of jasper , illinois .
and you just get distracted .
that's why it took me six years to graduate .
you have too good a time .
i wouldn't have done that .
you'd be surprised .
if i'd gone away , i would have worked my ass off .
but i didn't .
i don't want to talk about it .
is there a schooi you wanted to go to?
come on , teii me about coilege .
i got into arizona state and i didn't go .
why arizona state?
i iiked the footbaii team colors .
what's the big secret in arizona?
who am i gonna teil?
it was a stupid idea .
weil , i work for a movie producer .
i heartwenty stupid ideas a day .
i'm gonna need a iittle help with this .
thanks .
so , you and arizona state?
it's iong ago , years ago .
come on , please .
i wanted to study archaeology .
archaeology?
growing up i wanted to be iike donald johanson .
who's that?
in '74 he discovered the missing iink between humans and apes .
he was teaching at arizona state .
everything works out forthe best .
how's that?
my girlfriend didn't want to ieave home .
i was iearning to be a cook in my uncle's restaurant .
that was betterthan archaeology at arizona state?
it was reality .
do i iook iike an archaeologist?
do i talk iike one?
i don't know .
i've never met one .
i got a brain fuii of footbaii stats and recipes .
donald johanson mind that iowa state is cailed the hawkeyes ... and orthat oregano tastes great in gaspacho .
how do you know what stupid shit he knows?
certain people aren't supposed to do certain things .
i don't believe that .
aii i know is where i grew up , it was the same for everybody ... yourfavorite team was the flyers .
yourfavorite group was kiss .
yourfavorite " charlie's angel " was farrah .
you wore adidas sweatsuits and puma sneakers .
you smoked marlboros by twelve ... you wanted to iook iike travolta and act iike serpico .
i wanted to go on excavations to find iost cities ... that's for geeks and weirdoes .
i was afraid to teii kate jackson was my favorite " charlie's angel " .
i don't think people would have cared .
weil , maybe not in jasper , but in my neighborhood ... you got to a certain age , when you see that missus zito's backyard ... wasn't fucking cairo .
missus zito?
i used to stuff my knapsack with ... shovels and notebooks and i'd go whereverthere was some dirt .
and i go to parks and playgrounds and i go to backyards .
i'd just start digging .
i'd pretend it was egypt , asia , the middle of south america .
i fiiled up notebooks with diagrams ... of where i'd been and what i'd found .
it was aii junk .
it was just chicken bones , pieces of broken cups .
but i would treat those things iike precious artifacts .
i'd treat them iike they were bones from some prehistoric bird .
and you grow up ... you get older .
you understand iife better .
you see things and people for what they are .
and you realize those bones are chicken bones .
just ieftovers from someone's iunch .
did you mean jacklyn smith .
yourfavorite " charlie's angel " , jacklyn smith?
no , kate jackson .
kate jackson?
that's reaily?
what's wrong with kate jackson?
nothing .
ijust ...
i can see you not being into farrah and aii that perfection ... but kate jackson ...
sabrina overjacklyn smith?
that i don't get .
sabrina was very athletic .
i iiked that .
jacklyn was athletic .
rememberthe opening credits?
she knew aii the karate .
you don't think sabrina knew karate?
she was the smartest one .
yeah , of the " charlie's angels " , but that's a heii of a sliding curve .
who would you choose?
starsky from " starsky and hutch " .
i iiked the other guy .
hutch didn't have half the sex appeal .
i'm not talking about sex appeal , i'm talking about cool .
hutch was cool .
not as cooi as crocker on " miami vice " , but he was cool .
crocker was cool .
not my type , but definitely cool .
you know what i never got?
how did doc from " the love boat " get so many women?
women go for doctors .
because a doctor on the love boat , how impressive is that?
it didn't make any sense .
about as much as fonzie scoring .
what do you mean?
he wasn't what you'd caii a stud .
what do you mean?
weil , he's kinda short and pudgy .
he was " the fonz " .
i mean , he was " the fonz " .
aii right .
he was " the fonz " .
i got a question foryou .
if you had to go on a stakeout with a female cop ...
who would it be?
besides " charlie's angels "?
remember , the angels don't count .
they quit the force to work for charlie .
i'd have to say angie dickinson .
policewoman " .
very good .
besides being hot , she was the toughest , kick ass thing going .
tom , what are you doing here?
you know , even with aii this stuff that you've done ... it's easy to see you're not a kiiler .
you're a good person .
why don't we just end this before it goes any further?
you know , you remind me of these guys who eat at the restaurant .
they came in and talk about how they want a thick , tender steak .
and once the waiter comes over and teils them the special ... this big debate starts .
boy , that iobster sounds good .
geez , do i reaily want such a heavy meal?
me , ijust want a steak , i eat a fucking steak .
i don't want to see the menu , i don't need to hearthe specials .
if that test comes back positive , i'm gonna kiii you .
kiiling me is going to be more complicated than ordering a steak .
we'ii see .
how you gonna do it?
strangle me?
you gonna put a bag over my head?
come on , teii me .
my morbid curiosity wants to know .
i'm gonna cut yourthroat and you're gonna bleed to death .
you're gonna stand there and watch the blood spiii aii overthe floor?
you have that in you?
you could do that to another human being?
i couldn't do it to another human being ... but i can do it to you .
i can kiii you .
i hate to ruin your plans , but that test is coming back negative .
you don't know .
better hold onto that thought .
it's aii you have .
fuck you .
you can talk aii you want about tv and coilege footbaii railies . you can tangle that smart tongue of yours around anything you want .
you're just having a difficult time getting it .
nothing else matters to me .
if it comes back positive , i'm gonna kiii you .
the only thing that'ii be easier than that wiii be kiiling myself .
so who else knows you're gay?
i'm not gay .
you're not gay ...
who else knows you're " bi "?
i'm not " bi " .
i iike women .
you're straight?
you iike women , okay , aii right ...
you're a good iooking guy ... who's probably screwed every teresa maria and gina you've ever met .
and how many women have you screwed?
teii me .
not a iot .
whateveryou consider a iot , i'm iess than that .
less than a iot .
fuck you .
you've had ioads of women in the back seats of cars ...
you see , intercourse is such an intimate thing ...
i'm not the only one ...
i can't just fuck anyone ...
i need a bond .
admit it !
i need to trust .
our night was a one time deal .
one night doesn't make me anything .
you are absolutely right .
just iike if i spent one night with a woman ... it wouldn't make me straight .
you could sleep with playmates and it wouldn't make you straight .
i've had my share of girlfriends .
in high school .
even now , when i meet a woman that i'm sexuaily attracted to ... that i want to sleep with ... but does that mean that i'm gonna go get married and iive happily ...
neverto sleep with another man?
what's yourfucking point?
putting people in fucking boxes , you're straight oryou're gay .
it's nonsense .
human beings are too complex .
being with a man or wanting to be with a man doesn't make you gay .
it's totaily messed up .
if a giri goes to her boyfriend and says ... she wants to fuck around with another girl ... you think he's gonna be " weirded out " by that?
of course not .
he's gonna wanna watch , maybe even join in .
but if a guy asks his girlfriend the same question ... she'd fuckin 'flip her iid .
that's totaily messed up for guys who prefer women ... and have a slight curiosity about men .
they're forced into repressing it .
they're made to think iike there's something's wrong with them .
it isn't the act that is wrong .
that's what's natural .
what's wrong is how society makes you feei about it ... because nobody can admit ... that people aren't completely gay or completely straight .
it's nonsense .
where'd you get that , from " guide to how to make straight men gay "?
you have nothing to be ashamed of .
you're not here because i was with a man .
i know .
you think i'm responsible foryour ...
are you absolutely sure that you have it?
tests could be wrong .
mistakes can be made aii the time .
i tested it twice the iast three weeks .
three weeks?
that's how iong you've known?
twenty four days .
that's nothing .
no wonderyou're acting the way you are .
you're in shock overfinding out .
i'm in shock?
yes , you're in shock .
and you're reacting with an anger that anybody would have ... but most people wouldn't take it this far .
you gotta think about this .
just take the time to think about this .
this won't accomplish anything .
this is nobody's fault .
and iater on and i stiii feei this way , you'ii have no trouble coming back?
you don't realize here you're in deep trauma .
trauma?
i thought i was in shock .
this gets worse by the minute .
look , i realize you're upset .
but you've got to put some perspective on this .
perspective ...
people with hlv iead happy , healthy iives .
it's not a death sentence anymore .
you don't have alds , tom .
you are hlv positive .
there's a difference .
do you know the difference?
for someone who just had a negative hlvtest ... you seem overly concerned .
i'm not gonna iie to you , i'm gonna get the fuck out of here .
what are you gonna do to yourself when i walk out that door?
thank you forthe concern , but at twenty four days ... this is how i feei and nothing's gonna change that .
why did you pick me that night?
why'd you iet that night ever happen?
i have just one iife .
i chose one set of feelings over another .
and denied part of yourself .
i denied a part of myself so i could keep the most important .
and what was that?
yourtough guy image , your neighborhood pals?
my wife .
you said you weren't married .
high schooi sweethearts .
does she know?
know what?
that i was with you?
the only time i was ever unfaithfui was with a man?
that i'm hlv positive?
i don't know .
she might have figured ... some of it out after a doctor told her she had a lupaninopathy .
there's a word a iot of harvard guys don't know .
you're smart .
any idea?
swoilen glands .
it started causing her pain under her arms .
she had night sweats and she iost a few pounds .
we thought she was just worn down .
she always worked too hard .
they ran a iot of tests .
it was just one test to coverthe bases .
was she hlv positive?
twenty seven years old .
have you told her about this?
i can't .
you have to .
tom , you have to talk to her about it .
she was a mess when she ieft the doctor's office .
son of a bitch just iet her go ...
iike he just got through teiling her she had a fucking cold .
how do you teii somebody that and just iet them ieave?
wouldn't even caii me .
she was confused .
she was upset .
how do you teii somebody that and just iet them ieave?
she ran a iight .
she was alive when the ambulance got herto the hospital .
what must have been running through her mind when she missed that iight .
and what if it wasn't an accident?
what if she ran it ... because of the pain it caused her knowing i'd done something wrong?
maybe a prostitute , maybe another woman?
maybe the truth?
not being sure what to think , not wanting to hearthe truth ... so she runs a iight and doesn't have to hear it with her own ears .
doesn't have to hear ... how the man she's devoted her iife ... to isn't the man she thought he was .
and that's my biggest fear ... that when she went up to heaven , she found out .
and right now she's up there watching .
and she's so hurt .
she so hurt by what she knows about me .
i tried so hard to keep it from her .
she wouldn't understand .
how do you explain that?
that you can be kiiled by the person who you love most?
you just , you can't .
now you ask me again about perspective .
doing this isn't going to change anything .
we owe her .
what if she had it first?
it's possible .
she was showing symptoms before you were .
she was showing symptoms before you .
swoilen glands .
it makes sense she had it before you .
it could have happened that way .
it could have happened that way .
shut yourfucking mouth .
you're a reai fuck , do you know that?
fuck you !
what do you say we get out of here?
go back to your place?
you want to go back to my place?
no , we can't do that .
you know , it's true what they say about older women .
what is that?
we do try harder .
no , i can't .
i can't do it .
i'm sorry .
it's not personal .
i mean , you're cute , but you're nothing special .
sometimes you're just ionely .
you need to not be alone .
you know?
yes .
i know .
open your mouth .
open your mouth .
fuck you .
hey , do you know why most beer bottles are dark?
sunlight .
the beer sits in the sun too iong , you get that " skunky " taste .
do you know the purpose of a skunk's scent?
a defense against other animals .
that's right .
very good .
do you know how many sonnets shakespeare wrote?
a hundred and fifty four .
i don't understand shakespeare .
i have no idea what a sonnet is .
it's a iyric poem , fourteen iines .
oh , i don't give a shit .
there was a time i did .
i got aii those books on strange facts .
athousand and one things to know .
pretty stupid , huh?
there's something only a dumb person does and that's to feei so dumb .
you know what that stuff is?
that's not no smarts .
it's just dog tricks .
you roii over , you play dead , that's not no smarts .
i'd go to the museums , i walk around , i study the paintings .
but i never got it .
i tried .
i made an honest attempt to make myself better ... to improve who i was .
and then this happens .
one night and it destroys iives .
send everything else away and ieave behind nothing but pain .
it's aii i have now .
pain iike nothing i've ever known .
it doesn't ieave , it never ieaves .
there's so much ...
i have so much pain ...
so much ...
ijust want it to stop .
i'm so sorry .
i'm so sorry for everything .
it's gonna be okay .
it's not gonna be okay .
i'm sorry .
i'm sorry .
i wish i could hold you .
just teii you everything's gonna be okay .
it'ii be okay .
everything .
son of a bitch !
no , tom ...
you son of a bitch .
no , i was holding you , that's ail .
is this what you want?
you fuckin 'sneak !
you can't do this , tom !
there's too many ways this could have happened .
we kiiled her !
what if you're wrong?
aii you have to do is pass the test .
just pass the test .
tests aren't fool proof .
mistakes are made aii the time .
you are a perfect example of what's wrong with this world .
no one wiii stand up and say " it's me .
i'm guilty , i did it .
you iive by your own rules ... and now you have to pay forthat .
because i met you at a bar ... and i came back with you that i deserve this?
you came home with me twice .
and that makes me some kind of a monster?
by the way , if you remember , you invited me back here .
you set me up .
you're always gonna play it iike you're the innocent one .
you think because we came back here we were gonna fuck?
is that who you are?
you fuck every guy you meet?
trust me , you don't want to get into this .
you've got this idea about me .
and you're wrong .
you want me to be the evii one 'cause that makes it easierforyou .
you reaily think you're a victim?
you're convinced of it , aren't you?
you know i am .
dan , when was the iast time you had sex?
i don't see how that has anything to do with this .
what is it , a secret?
some dangerto nationai security?
weil , if ijust knew the relevance of the question ...
listen to yourself .
you sound iike a iawyer .
i only want to know when was the iast time you had sex?
i had sex four months ago with a guy named bob .
bob .
bob taylor .
bob taylor .
you're sure of that?
very .
it's always " very " with you .
very sure , very safe .
yeah , i iike the word .
you know what the worst thing about adultery is?
once you do it , you're always an adulterer .
life is harsh iike that .
you're a fuckin 'saint , aren't you?
you fuck once , you can never be a virgin again .
you steai once , you're always a thief .
and if you've iied once , then you're always a iiar .
but i'm not a iiar , am i?
when was the iast time you had sex?
bob taylor .
last summer .
you fuck once , you can never be a virgin again .
bob taylor .
lie once and you're a fucking iiar .
when was the iast time you had sex?
i'm fucking teiling you !
what about that guy you met at shampoo the other night?
you know , the skinny blond kid .
what?
what about him?
how do you know about that?
that wasn't bob , was it?
you were foilowing me?
how iong have you been foilowing me?
when you were aii over him ... are you teiling him how you were a " big scaredy cat "?
you fucking foilowed me .
when you went to his place did you teii him how you were " safe "?
very safe "?
we kissed .
nothing else .
that's it .
you were up there a pretty iong time .
we watched tv .
oh , yeah , what did you watch?
i don't know , i don't remember .
but nothing happened .
that's it , nothing happened .
i mean , we were up there only kissing , you're sure?
you weren't in the room .
that's not the story i caught blondie teiling at the bar a few nights iater .
ronald was pretty graphic .
weil , he's iying .
he's a iiar .
who?
ronald .
is that his name?
i made that up .
weil , he's iying .
you know kids , you buy them a few drinks , they'ii teii you anything .
you're iying .
it's so hard to get the truth around here .
i did nothing wrong .
you see this iie?
you could have said this iast tuesday ... but you wanted to appear pure .
but you're not , are you?
you're not pure .
i watched you for a short time ... and i caught you in a iie .
i didn't come iooking to do this , but after seeing the way you are ... it only made sense what i had to do .
i can imagine the otherfive years .
how many blondies have there been?
i neverforced anyone to be with me .
what about aii the others you got sick?
they don't count?
i'm not sick !
you played god with that kid .
why would you want to do that?
you do whateveryou want ... and if people get hurt , too bad forthem .
oh , so now i'm responsible for everyone?
why not?
fuck you .
people make choices .
you made a choice .
i owe you nothing .
then why so many tests?
if you felt no responsibility to protect other people ...
then why so many tests?
for me .
for me .
if i was sick , i'd want to know so i could take care of myself .
but how is it possible for someone who's always safe to get sick?
a iot of safe people get tested .
and a iot of unsafe people don't .
why is that?
i didn't trick anyone .
you cheated on your wife .
no one but you .
you said you needed a bond , you said you needed trust .
we fucked after only two hours after meeting each other .
that's not a deception , that's not a trick?
you just gonna keep twisting it around?
i foilowed you .
i saw you .
yeah , i'd iike to foilow you , you fuckin 'cretin ... see where you go , what you do .
see how much of this shit is " the true truth " ... and how much of it is yourtruth .
how many guys have there reaily been , tom?
five , ten?
how many drunken nights did you stop at the park and give someone head?
and am i here because i'm the only one ... or because i'm the only one you could find?
and now you want to know how many men i've fucked .
what about five years ago?
you didn't give a shit then , did you?
aii you cared about was one dick up your ass ... before you slipped into your pretty iittle wife's bed .
i'm ready to iet you go .
i wiil .
i'ii iet you go ... but i want you once , i want this one time , you teii me the truth .
i've told you the truth .
no , no .
not some builshit you think i want to hear .
admit to me that you've made mistakes .
you haven't worn rubbers sometimes , maybe a iot .
you've gotten drunk and can't remember .
teii me always means sometimes and i'ii iet you go .
it's not true .
i'ii end it but i need the truth .
teii me you nevertook a test before and you walk .
i can't do that .
teii me how sorry you are ... that you didn't realize what you were doing .
teii me you were with aii those men ... because you were ionely .
i could understand that .
teii me that .
i'ii iet you go .
i wiil .
no , it's not true .
you're iying to me .
lying .
you're iying to me .
that's one more iie .
teii me you've kiiled people .
teii me you nevertook a test 'cause you don't give a shit about anyone .
teii me you kiiled me .
teii me you kiiled my wife .
i should kiii you right now .
i should .
you don't fuckin 'care .
you don't care .
i don't care?
every day of my iife i think about this .
everyone i touch ... and you sit there and say that i don't care?
when every day ... every day someone says , " you've got to be safe and careful , dan .
don't make a mistake , dan .
and you think you understand?
you don't understand anything .
ijust want to be with someone and don't think about it .
for one second , i want to know what it feels iike not to care .
you sit in your iittle fuckin 'house with your iittle wife ... and your basebaii games and you think nothing's gonna touch you .
weil , fuck you , it did .
what do you think's gonna happen now?
even if it comes back positive , there'ii be doubt if it was her .
and that's the good news .
because when that comes back negative there wiii be no doubt .
she ran that red iight because she couldn't iive with what she'd done .
she gave it to you , tom .
she gave it to you .
and your whole world is over .
you're free to go .
dan , before you go i need to know something .
were you ever reaily tested before?
what does it matter now?
it doesn't .
no , i wasn't .
why?
i guess i was afraid .
you guess?
i was afraid .
you didn't want to know .
no , i didn't .
ijust knew ...
ijust knew i didn't have it .
i reaily am sorry about your wife .
i hope you find some help .
it was positive .
the test was positive .
no , it's not possible .
i'm sorry .
why are you doing this?
why are you iying to me , tom?
you wouldn't have iet me go .
today is day twenty six and it seems different .
stacey would have every right to do to me what i did to you .
i promised things to her , i loved her .
and i was supposed to protect her ... and in the end i'm the responsible for what happened to her .
but with you , i put my iife in your hands ... someone i didn't even know , and i got what i deserved .
and you're probably getting what you deserve .
no , you don't deserve this .
no one deserves this .
why are you doing this?
why are you doing this?
why are you fucking with me?
i'm healthy .
look at me .
wiii you iook at me?
look at me !
