excuse me?
i don't mind .
lf you need a lift , i'll give you a ride .
oh , okay .

how am i gonna wave you home if i can't see the play?
i'm a hall of famer .
how about showing respect?

i'm from st. louis .
i actually moved out here to play triple a ball with the beavers ... ... but ended up hurting my shoulder , and it kind of ended my career .
oh , you threw your arm out pitching .

hit yourself over the head with a brick ... ... and say that they were kidnapped .
shut up .
happy new year .
you think nick's okay?
what are you worried about him for?
i'm not .
it's just ... ... maybe we were a little rough .
oh , please .
that player got what he deserved .
get your butts on this horse .
you got $400?
i've been thinking .
we should've brought soup or something .
what for?
because dad's sick .
what is he gonna eat?
he's a dad .
i'm sure he has soup .
he must be lonely , living all by himself .
look , don't bug him about that .
lf we want him to hook up with mom , we have to be subtle .
got it?
i got it .
come on , y'all .
let's get out of here .
want some chocolate cake?
it's world famous .
mom says i shouldn't have sugar .
what about you?
it'll make your mouth all chocolatey .
no , thanks .
hey .
you forgot something .
sorry about what happened today .
i really wish you guys didn't have to see that .
he used to look at me like that .
i know , man .
and when he hugged you , you thought he'd never let you go .
they make you laugh , they tell you they love you ... ... then one day , they never come back .
i bet you know all about leaving , don't you , player?
know what?
as a matter of fact , i do .
but only because the same thing happened to me when i was your age .
yeah , my pops walked out on us too .
it's a shame that anybody can call theyself a father .
but listen ... ... he's the failure in this , not you .
he's the one that's gonna miss out .
i just hope it don't take you guys as long as it took me to figure that out ... ... because it's true .
you guys are some cool kids .
there you go .
come on , let's get out of here .
nick?
what's up , little man?
lf my dad left and your dad left ... ... does that mean i'll end up like you?
i ain't doing too bad .
look , i have blingage .
that's not exactly what i meant .
i was watching oprah , and it was all about how depressed and lonely ...
... bachelors like you are .
i'm not depressed or lonely .
yes , you are .
no , i'm not .
yes , you are .
no , i'm not .
mom says that if a man is not married by the time he's 35 ...
... he's either damaged or gay .
what?
well , that would explain those earrings .
watch it , sucker .
but you do have intimacy issues , don't you?
no , i don't .
yes , you do .
no , i don't .
yes , you do .
look , it's obvious you need a timeout ... ... and you need a little tickle time .
because all you do is ask a thousand questions , huh?
hey .
are you all right?
kevin .
i'm good .
you sure?
yeah , except ...
... l'm out .
okay , don't worry about that .
we'll get you more once we get there .
oh , sure , we can wait ... ... if you want me to die !
they're closing !
do something , nick .
no , no , wait .
hold on !
wait a minute .
we need a refill .
sorry , we're closed .
come back tuesday .
but i got a sick kid here .
look , i couldn't help you even if i wanted to .
the pharmacist has left for the holiday .
well , where is he?
he's off duty .
and i doubt very much he's gonna want some guy interrupting his holi
just a second , sir , and i'll draw you up a map .
hey , nick , that guy was such a meanie .
how'd you get him to do what you wanted?
oh , that was simple .
i just gave him the look .
it works every time .
it even worked through glass?
oh , yeah .
the look is something i developed when i was a kid .
i had somewhat of a reputation .
surprise , surprise .
i don't want everybody stepping to me , so i give them the look ... ... which told them , " back off .
that's a bad mother " " shut your mouth .
i wish i could do that .
you got somebody bothering you at school?
an asthmatic in the accelerated program?
what do you think?
try this .
it's foolproof .
no , no , check the lip , check the lip .
man , do not take my lunch money .
here we go , killer .
come on .
hey , hey , where y'all going?
excuse me , i'm looking for the pharmacist .
delwyn?

that's enough .
i got it .
give me that .
stop clowning around now .
yo .
give me my shoe .
yo .
excuse me , are you the pharmacist?
not at the moment .
why?
well , look , i got a kid with me , man .
he's got asthma real bad .
try some steam .
that usually helps .
hey , hey .
knock it off .
steam?
that's enough of that .
look , look , all i need is a refill , okay?
and i know you can help .
i'm asking you nice .
mister , i've been married for 38 years .
you can't scare me .
come on , man , you the pharmacist .
i know you took a oath or something .
not that i can remember , no .
hey , will you go over there and behave yourself?
yeah , go get him over there .
you know , folks around here like to barter .
you get what you want , i get what i want .
one hand washes the other .
i scratch your back
get to the point .
whoa , whoa , whoa , you can't clown me .
watch the kids .
all of them?
you little
oh , my word .
pie and cake and brownies and pie .
you said " pie " twice .
i like pie .
kevin , you know mom would be upset ... ... if we were even thinking about trying any of these ... ... chocolatey ... ... creamy ... ... delicious ....
hey , i was gonna eat those brownies .
what?
just take those .
no , i want yours .
take it easy , man .
sorry .
ridiculous .

why y'all ganging up on him?
you think you so tough?
i'd like to see you try that with somebody my size .
okay !

it means nothing .
i wouldn't wanna spend new year's with us either .
who would?
me .

but you know what?
maybe your mother's right , you know .
maybe i'm not cut out for this .
i mean , look at you two .

you'll get used to it .
yeah , and there's books you can read too .
thanks .
but you know what?
lf we're not magically in front of your mother ... ... in the next 30 minutes or so ... ... she'll never talk to me again .
