i'm doing the best that i can .
i know that's all i can ask of myself .
but is that good enough?
is my work doing any good?
is anybody paying attention?
is it hopeless to try and change things?
the african guy's a sign , right?
because if he isn't ... then nothing in this world makes any sense to me .
i'm fucked .
maybe i should quit .

maybe i should just fucking quit .

i don't know what the fuck i'm supposed to fucking do anymore .

i'm glad we saved a piece of this marsh .
i know it's small , but at least it's something .
<i> [ camera shutter clicks ] </ i>
don't stop fighting .
we're going to save a lot more of this place .
to celebrate , i have a poem i'd like to read .
nobody sits like this rock sits .
you rock , rock .
the rock just sits and is .
you show us how to just sit here , and that's what we need .
yeah , we did it .
any press come?
yeah , local paper's here .
what's wrong?
nothing .
it's just i have an appointment to check out this african guy .
what african guy?
exactly .
what african guy?
come on .
<i>hello .
albert markovski . </ i>
<i>i have a 1 : 00 appointment . </ i>
sorry , i'm late .
this place is like a maze .
have a seat .
we'll be right with you .
why don't you just tell me what your situation is .
look , i'm not really sure i know exactly what you guys do here , all right?
well , we , uh ...
we'll investigate and solve your case .
how?
if you sign a contract , we'll follow you .
you'll spy?
yes .
on me?
yes .
<i> will you be spying on me in the bathroom? </ i>
yes .
in the bathroom?
yes .
<i> why? </ i>
there's nothing too small .
you know when police find the slightest bit of d. n. a. and build a case?
if we might see you ... you floss or masturbate ... that could be the key to your entire reality .
so i'm hiring you to spy on me .
that's right .
so we can figure out your situation and resolve your crisis .
in addition , my associate will approach your case from a different angle .
what do you mean a different angle?
what does that mean?
regarding your perception of reality .
he'll tell you about that .
who sent you here?
nobody .
i found your card .
where?
in some fancy restaurant that i'd never been to before .
<i>i didn't have the proper attire . </ i>
<i>so they let me borrow a suitjacket . </ i>
<i>i reached into my pocket, </ i> <i>and there was your card . </ i>
<i>the weird thing is</ i> <i>i always have a jacket . </ i>
<i> [ woman ]
but not that day? </ i>
<i> no . </ i>
<i> brad stand . </ i>
hey .
<i> kind of a coincidence . </ i>
yes , exactly .
my case is a coincidence .
<i> about the restaurant and thejacket? </ i>
no , no .
that that's ...
i'm talking about a big coincidence .
it involves one man .
it's a three parter .
okay .
ready?
first part .
i went to a place called schottinger's photo archives .
<i>i was there getting stills</ i> <i>of early bob dylan . </ i>
<i>in comes this tall african guy . </ i>
<i>he's like 18 years old or something . </ i>
<i>you know , he's in there getting photos</ i> <i>of morris chestnut ... </ i>
<i>shaquille o'neal, </ i> <i>jim carrey . </ i>
<i>he's an autograph hound . </ i>
<i>kind of guy likes to get ... </ i> glossies of famous people and get them signed .
<i>two weeks later , i see</ i> <i>the same african guy . </ i>
<i>he's working as a doorman</ i> <i>at my friend's building . </ i>
oh , my god !
who's your friend?
jay wendorff .
but it's not his apartment .
it's his girlfriend's .
what's her name?
uh , kelly .
kelly coulter .
so , okay , that's two .
<i>one time at schottinger's</ i> <i>photo archive ... </ i> <i>second time</ i> <i>as the doorman . </ i>
third , i see this man , he's in a van at the mall .
<i> what are you doing at the mall? </ i>
i'm working .
<i> i'm making a statement for the open spaces . </ i>
<i> [ horn honking ] </ i>
<i>yeah , he's back . </ i>
<i>you crazy bastard . </ i>
you don't plant no tree in this parking lot !
<i>i gotta come take that tree, </ i> <i>remove it and let traffic through . </ i>
<i>you'rejust creatin'</ i> <i>more work for me . </ i>
they're not always meaningful .
yeah , it's meaningful .
<i> meaningful how? </ i>
that's what i want you to find out .
about your life .
yeah , about my life .
and about the whole thing .
about the universe , you know?
the big one .
<i>i mean , should i keep doing</ i> <i>what i'm doing?
is it hopeless? </ i>
mr. markovski , we see a lot of people in here ... who claim they want to know the ultimate truth about reality .
they want to peer under the surface at the big everything ... but this can be a very painful process full of surprises .
it can dismantle the world as you know it .
<i>that's why most people prefer to remain</ i> <i>on the surface of things . </ i>
maybe you should go home .
let sleeping dogs lie .
take it easy .
what do you say?
i say don't give me the brush off .
please .
i want to know .
this is big .
have you ever transcended space and time?
<i> yes .
no . </ i>
uh , time not space .
no , i don't know what you're talking about .
i take it you don't make very much money , mr. markovski .
<i>is that gonna be a problem? </ i>
<i>are you expensive , what you do? </ i>
<i>we have a sliding scale . </ i>
<i>some of our clients pay $30 a week . </ i>
some of our wealthy clients pay several thousand a week .
i can't believe you guys actually exist .
how long have you been doing this?
<i> seventeen years , 352 cases . </ i>
that's crazy .
i'm gonna have to ask you to please steer clear of my office ... because my work situation is a little shaky , all right?
you want us to stay away from your job?
yeah .
if you come snooping around my office ... it could make me look unstable and it could hurt me .
i want you to meet my colleague .
bernard?
uh huh .
this is mr. markovski .
hi .
he's going to have to be pro bono .
okay .
sounds good .
<i>thank you very much</ i> <i>for taking on my case . </ i>
oh , you're welcome .
you're welcome .
hold on .
he hasn't signed a contract .
let's do this and then we'll get to the contract .
it's too much too soon .
it's always too much too soon .
that's the nature of the beast .
approach , patience , finesse .
will you stop?
come on .
we need to start with his specifics , bernard .
we need to go past logic though .
come on .
let's go .
give me a kiss .
come on .
okay .
will you tell me where we're having dinner tonight?
korean barbecue .
really?
<i>okay , let's get started . </ i>
is this part of my investigation?
yes .
say this blanket represents all the matter and energy in the universe , okay?
you , me , everything .
nothing has been left out , all right?
all the particles , everything .
what's outside this blanket?
more blankets .
that's the point .
blanket's everything .
exactly .
this is everything .
let's just say that this is me , all right?
and i'm , what , 60 odd years old and i'm wearing a gray suit .
blah , blah , blah .
and let's say over here , this is you .
and , you're ...
i don't know , you're 21 .
you got dark hair , etc .
and over here , this is vivian , my wife and colleague .
then over here , this is the eiffel tower , right?
it's paris .
and this is a war .
and this is , uh , a museum .
and this is a disease .
and this is an orgasm .
and this is a hamburger .
everything is the same even if it's different .
exactly .
but our everyday mind forgets this .
we think everything is separate .
limited .
i'm over here .
you're over there .
which is true .
but it's not the whole truth because we're all connected .
because we ... are connected .
sure .
sure .
sure .
sure .
okay?
yeah .
all right , now , we need to learn ... how to see the blanket truth all the time .
right in the everyday stuff .
and that's what this is for .
why?
why what?
why do i need to learn how to see the blanket thing all the time in the everyday stuff?
you wouldn't want to miss out on the big picture , would you?
uh uh .
that's partly why you're here , right?
and this is it .
i'm talking about it right now .
it will take a while for you to get it , you know?
but ... it will help you .
<i> [ zipper unzipping ] </ i>
how?
when you get the blanket thing you can relax ... because everything you could ever want or be , you already have and are .
that sound pretty good?
that sounds very good .
all right , get in .
you want me to get in?
so , get in here?
yeah .
what's going to happen to me in there?
oh , hey , you're gonna see .
you'll find out .
<i>the purpose of this suit , mr. markovski, </ i> <i>is to help shut down ... </ i> <i>your everyday perceptions</ i> <i>and give up your usual identity ... </ i>
<i> that you think separates you from everything . </ i>

hey , how are you?
so what's the open spaces take on that?
well , i think you guys can definitely rebuild in areas ... that are already run down instead of tearing up new land .
<i> [ albert's voice ]
new land .
new land . </ i>
we're open to that .
that's who we are at open spaces .
we can't throw that away .
we're not asking you to throw that away .
i'm not gonna bullshit you , right?
part of this is we took a beating in the press for all our growth .
opening so many stores in such a short time .
so if we work with you and your open spaces coalition ... is that gonna help the huckabees image?
yes .
does it help me?
yes .
do i benefit from getting some great p. r. for huckabees when we need it?
absolutely .
but do i care about saving the open spaces?
yes , i do .

all right?
yeah .
okay .
how am i supposed to practice at home?
i don't have one of these .

i'm lucky if i last another day !
we can solve your case sooner if you're straight with us .
i'm being straight with you .
brad smeared me ... and took the coalition in a different direction .
that's straight .
<i> at schottinger's photo archive</ i> <i>where you met mr. nimieri ... </ i>
who's mr<i> ...
</ i> who's that?
the african guy .
<i> that's the african guy from my coincidence . </ i>
this is what i wanna talk about .
<i> it wasn't your first time at schottinger's , was it? </ i>
did i say it was?
you did .
you agree it wasn't?
<i>sure .
it wasn't my first time . </ i>
<i>big deal . </ i>
it was more like a regular thing with you .
and you weren't finding a still of bob dylan .
you were planting photos of yourself in the archive .
what are you getting at?
<i> why would you do something like that? </ i>
<i>to be noticed . </ i>
<i>maybe urgently . </ i>
<i> maybe , yeah . </ i>
<i> uh huh . </ i>
how did that affect things with brad at the coalition?
how did it affect things at the coalition?
i don't know .
you know , it was a drag .
it really was a drag .
because i wanted my poems to go out with the fund raiser mailing .
brad didn't .
he was all obsessed with shania and pete sampras .
not what we were really supposed to be focusing on ... hurt .
you planted photos of yourself and your poems at schottinger's .
brad didn't respect you .
no , he didn't .
and yet you brought him into the open spaces coalition .
why is that?
i needed the sponsor to take my cause to another level .
that's why .
why else would i do it?
like we said .
to be noticed .
this is absurd .
show me my folder .
no .
that is not productive .
at the photo archive , you spent a lot of time ...
iooking at old jessica lange bathing suit stills , why?
<i>that's only because lange</ i> <i>comes before markovski . </ i>
i was putting my head shots under markovski , and then " l " is right before it .
i might've looked at a little bit of lange on the way out .
what's the big deal?
<i> albert , baby , come on . </ i>
what , is it a crime?
is it a crime to look at lange?
<i> [ vivian ]
have you ever been in love? </ i>
what kind of question is that?
do you even believe in love?
<i> or do you only have fantasy relationships ... </ i> because anything else would be too painful?
bernard , excuse me .
but i'm making some progress here .
so am i , darling .
so am i.
<i>oh , no , no .
i'm not going in that thing . </ i>
<i>every time i go in there ... </ i> it's all hating faces that i have to chop up with a machete .
<i>and then they multiply . </ i>
<i>and we're going to address that right now . </ i>
okay?
i'll leave it to you .
<i>come on .
you can't retreat . </ i>
<i>back into the fray , albert .
let's go . </ i>
i'm in your corner .
<i>[ heart beating ] </ i>
<i>okay , albert , i want you to melt</ i> <i>your usual identity like you did before . </ i>
<i> [ woman laughing ] </ i>
stop looking at me .
i said stop looking at me .
dawn is gonna love doing spots for the open spaces .
who's dawn?
miss huckabees .
dawn .
she loves your poems .
the one about the rock .
nobody sits like this rock sits .
that's the one .
she loves poems .
she loves forests , meadows , getting outside .
we'll just throw thejet skis on the trailer and head to the mountains .
wait , you guys ...
you go with misshuckabees?
she was doing some print work for us ...

<i>forget brad .

<i>where are you?

<i>albert . </ i>
<i>picture a tree in a field . </ i>
<i>good .

hey , dickweed .
<i> [ albert ]
still brad stand . </ i>
<i> add someone else . </ i>
<i> like who? </ i>
<i>you know , someone who can understand</ i> <i>things .
someone who can help you . </ i>
<i> who's your guide? </ i>
well , i use magritte , a belgian surrealist .
<i> i got someone . </ i>
<i> who is it? </ i>
<i>mrs .
schirmir .
she was my high school</ i> <i>english teacher .
she helped me . </ i>
<i> all right , good . </ i>
<i> he pushed her out of the tree . </ i>
<i>okay , mrs. schirmir has a vacuum cleaner, </ i> <i>albert , that sucks up fear . </ i>
<i>now she's going to send you</ i> <i>rays of security and complete acceptance . </ i>
<i>he chopped her head off ! </ i>
hold on .
hold on .
hold on .
you're doing well .
now , don't give up now .
didn't she vacuum a lot?
but then he vacuumed her .
i had to chop him up with a machete .
okay , albert .
i can let you in on a couple of secrets .
one , your mind is always occupied on something ... so it may as well be something helpful like mrs. schirmir and her vacuum cleaner .
two , there is no such thing as you and me .
so then there's just nothing?
three , there's no such thing as nothing .
there is no remainder in the mathematics of infinity .
there's only the blanket .
i thought i understood the blanket .
now i'm not sure .
<i>flags and bags . !
huckabees says, </ i> <i>" happy birthday , mr. president . " </ i>
50 % off all knapsacks and pocketbooks .

let freedom ring .
at huckabees ... the everything store .
huckabees cornucopia of stuff we all want .
but what happened to the gazelles?
were they squashed ... under the cd department?
hey , albert , how's it goin '?
what are you doing here , brad?
i met brad when i was investigating you .
he called with his own existential conundrum .
that's all .
i'm really glad i found out about these people .
<i> that's bullshit . </ i>
he doesn't care about things like this .
bring me the african guy .
where's that african guy?
dude , what're you talking about?
<i> why does he get to write poetry? </ i>
there's no gazelles in north america .
just so you know .
and that building squashing nature is my imagery .
you don't write poetry .
<i>[ bernard ] </ i>
<i>everyone's intake procedure is different . </ i>
i asked brad to write a poem .
<i>and it wasn't enough that</ i> <i>you came to my coalition ... </ i> now you have to come here and do ...
okay , okay .
<i>[ bernard ] </ i>
<i>all right , that's good . </ i>
we're the same , brad .
it's all the blanket .
<i>there you go . </ i>
<i>give it a shot . </ i>
that is wonderful , albert .
<i> oh , honey , he's got it . </ i>
how are things at the coalition , brad?
great .
much smoother .
<i>great , i look forward to coming back</ i> <i>and working with you . </ i>
i don't think that's going to happen , my friend .
<i>i'm still in the charter . </ i>
<i>i built the coalition from scratch . </ i>
yeah .
yeah .
well , i don't want to cramp you here .
<i>that's what you mean to do . ! </ i>
<i>that's exactly what you mean to do . ! </ i>
what?
what?
what?
you see what he's doing?
tell them what you're doing .
what?
he's come here to conquer you like he conquered my coalition .
<i>and now he's here today to unnerve me so</ i> <i>that when orrin comes to town , i will blow it . </ i>
that's what you mean to do .
<i> albert , please . ! </ i>
oh , my god , brad .
you're killing me .
<i> what are you talking about? </ i>
<i>what am i talking ... </ i>
<i>okay , when orrin comes , i'll blow it . </ i>
i'll get kicked out , and then he can do whatever he wants with the coalition .
who's orrin?
<i> orrin is the open spaces national director . </ i>
he's coming to review our charter .
i hope this isn't about dawn .
he has a crush on my girlfriend .
that's crazy !
why do you stare at her?
<i> she's a model . ! </ i>
<i> [ brad laughs ] </ i>
i'm going home .
<i> oh , no . !
albert , please . </ i>
<i>stay with us for mancala hour . </ i>
i'm gonna have a fucking ball at mancala hour , aren't i?
maybe albert should meet his other .
what?
tommy?
no , that's a bad idea right now .
<i>yes , a dicey move .
maybe even dangerous, </ i> <i>but potentially inspired . </ i>
bernard , give them both a connection .
maybe , but tommy's in a bad direction .
it could spread to albert .
you said tommy was gonna be fine .
what are you leaving out?
nothing .
give him his other .
it's an inspired idea .
it's groovy .
the connection will come back to us , bernard .
it all comes around .
like you say , take the long view .
long view .
what's the other?
we're going to find out right now .
shh . <i>?
<i> [ man ]
there was a drought . </ i> <i>?
<i> there was no crop . </ i> <i>?
<i>no olives . </ i>
no soul of life .
no rabbit in the oven .
we mashed locusts and made bread .
i have no idea what you guys are talking about .
i thought we were going to talk about petroleum .
<i>mrs .
echevarria visits us</ i> <i>once a year from spain . </ i>
she's sort of a little treat for our clients .
a kind of spiritual petit four .
something that would be useful for you to be accustomed to .
yeah , a real treat .
you have received your answer .
senorita , the petroleum situation was not created by nature ...
like the drought or the olives or any of that .
it was created by people , and this is the facts .
it was created by people who act like nothing's happening ...
and that's causing all the problems .
no , no , tommy .
one question only<i> .
uno . </ i>
okay .
here's the question ...
no , no .
i think ...
you've had your question and the answer , tommy , please .
senora is tired .
senorita , why do people only ask themselves deep questions ... when something really bad happens?
then they forget all about it after .
right?
how come people are self destructive?
<i>and third, </ i> <i>i refuse to use petroleum ... </ i> but there's no way i can stop its use in my lifetime , is there?
jimmy carter would have a great electric car by now .
i could have a cadillac escalade , and it would be electric .
i wouldn't have to ride on my bicycle .
that is three questions .
i paid my money and i want a fucking answer .
so just give me a second .
<i>i know , dear boy .
we wanted</ i> <i>you to meet albert . </ i>
i thought you said next week .
it turns out he can use a connection sooner than later .
tommy has been working with us since that ...
the big september thing .
he's going to be your other .
what is it exactly?
like a buddy system i think .
<i>when we dismantle, </ i> <i>it can get kind of rough .
and it helps ... </ i> to have a friend going through the same .
do you drive a car?
a bike .
sometimes i take the bus .
good .
that's good .
i like that .
i can see why they put us together .
tommy corn .
albert markovski .
i'll be your other .

what's happening with your case?
i don't know .
what do you mean?
they won't let me see my coincidence file .
you want them to solve a coincidence?
that's why you came here?
yeah , that's why i came here .
who's the girl?
<i>the face of huckabees . </ i>
tops and mops?
that's her .
i doubt your coincidence is meaningful .
why?
i have a book by a french thinker named caterine vauban .
she says the same thing they say here about dismantling your reality to see the big picture .
what's the difference?
here , they say everything's connected in the blanket .
vauban says nothing's connected .
it's all random and cruel .
it doesn't matter what you do .
that's nihilism , tommy !
they find it threatening .
but it is very convincing .
you know , my ex girl won't let me see my daughter .
she's brainwashing her not to think or feel .
<i> what kind of reality is that? </ i>
not this one .
<i>exactly .
i think you shouldjust look</ i> <i>in your file if you want to . </ i>
how am i gonna look at my file?
you wanna see your file?
i'll distract them .
you slip in for it .
act naturally .
here comes your boy .
hey , you play mancala?
didn't know you were interested in existential issues , brad .
why?
'cause i'm a dumb sales executive instead of a sensitive artist like you?
no , i just never heard you talk about it .
that's all .
why do you think i joined the open spaces coalition , man?
i thought you cared about the issues .
i do .
obviously you had a different agenda , didn't you?
what books do you read?
<i> what books do i read? </ i>
philjackson's <i>sacred hoops . </ i>
<i>really .
i read the galleys when it arrived</ i> <i>at huckabees , and you know what? </ i>
seriously , that book's got some good questions .
you should read it .
isn't it sports questions in that book?
no , wise ass .
philjackson's a smart guy .
all right , come on .
it was an honest question , brad .
felt a little hostile .
i feel the same thing from him .
who the hell are you?

it is our immigration agreement .
we must work .

<i> i don't want to hear it again . </ i>

he opened cans with a big knife like at the camp .
there aren't lions roaming here but there were in sudan , and the orphan boys got chased .

<i>[ albert ]
you mean</ i> <i>the existential detectives? </ i>
sounds like a support group .
why can't he use a church?
<i>sometimes people</ i> <i>have additional questions to be answered . </ i>
like what?
well , um , for instance ...
if the forms of this world die , which is more real ... the me that dies or the me that's infinite?
can i trust my habitual mind or do i need to learn to look beneath those things?
<i>sounds like we got</ i> <i>a philosopher . </ i>
<i>we don't have to ask those kinds</ i> <i>of questions , do we , mom? </ i>
no , honey .
what happened to the cat , albert?

the cat was killed by curiosity .
right .

ask steven .
he could have used a little suburban sprawl in sudan .

that man is not in our coalition .
he has no right to be here and no right to speak .
no , ma'am , i'm not a member , but i am a local firefighter .
he's a great firefighter and exactly who we want on our side .
i don't know who these men are .
they're not members of our coalition .

this is my meeting .
i'm the director .
we gave you a chance .
you're out of the charter .
he can't be out of the charter .
he is the charter .
i wrote it .
marty , call security .

all in favor of brad becoming the new leader of the coalition , say aye .
<i> [ group ]
aye . ! </ i>
hey , come on .
that's bullshit .
congratulations .
be strong .
be strong 'cause you're going to be back .
don't worry about those people .
they don't appreciate you .
albert , what happened in there is reality .
it's cruelty and it's chaos .
the detectives are wrong .
what were you trying to do?
you were trying to do a good thing , right?
well , look what happened .
i'm going to the other side , albert .
i seriously suggest ... you consider coming with me ... as my other .
albert ...
you're wrong !
you're full of shit .
you guys got nothing to offer , man .
<i> tommy , no ... </ i>
this is the money right now .
yes?
<i> no . ! </ i>
you know how hurt you feel?
this is the perfect opportunity to dismantle now .
stay away from me !
stop !
look !
listen !
throughout infinity ... your energy recycles into every possible relation ... to everyone else's energy , even brad's .
<i>you've been predator</ i> <i>and prey with him . </ i>
friends , enemies , brother , sister , mother , child .
i give and i give and i give ... and he takes and he takes and he takes .
mama .
all right , baby .
all right .
yahhh !
it's a romantic fantasy .
and you left that part out , okay?
when you were taking my cash .
i want it back .
yeah , and if i wasn't pro bono , i'd want my money back too .
send it to my ex for my kids .
hey , sign your bike out .
sign your bike out !
tommy , come on !
go !
i'll block for you .
cocksucker !
motherfucking bitch ass motherfucking cocksucker !
you're all a bunch of big babies !
maybe i should just quit .
i mean , what's the point of life anyway?
i can answer these questions for you .
you can?
because i don't think the other guys are doing such a hot job .
believe me , i can .
you're the writer tommy's into?
are you unhappy with their work?
yeah , i'm ready to cross over to your side .
tell me about your case .
well , you seem to be following me pretty closely .
why don't you tell me about it?
you are miserable .
obsessed with your strange coincidence .
yeah .
yeah , but they just want to talk about brad stand .
they betrayed you , as he did .
that's right .
betrayal embodies the universal truth you seek .
what truth?
cruelty , manipulation ... meaninglessness .
yeah .
did they follow you?
no .
i lost them on route 4 .
thanks for helping me out back there .
no problem .
glad you're here , albert .
this is the place to be .
once you realize the universe sucks , you got nothing to lose .
that's what gives you <i>la force . </ i>
the force?
<i> la force .
</ i> it's french for strength .
<i> la force . </ i>
you guys got a method here?
<i>yeah .
deconstruct your mind</ i> <i>to the blackness , okay? </ i>
just accept it for what it is .
nothing .
there's no glowing guys , no infinite mothers .
none of that bullshit .
my coincidence is meaningless , isn't it?
<i>think , albert .
have</ i> <i>you betrayed yourself? </ i>
<i>[ albert ]
wait a second . </ i>
<i>what are we doing here? </ i>
i don't want to go to this building .

what did she give you?
no , stay away from me .
i don't want to talk to you .
thanks , steven .
well , this is a rare occasion .
where is she?
who?
caterine .
<i> who's caterine? </ i>
the woman who's spying on me .
where is she?
i don't think this is funny .
oh , god , here we go again .
what's happening?
he's just making a joke on me .
are you making fun of your mother?
no .
why can't you get along with her?
so , how's your poetry job?
i got fired from it .
oh , couldn't even hold down a poetry job .
<i> [ man ]
brenda , what the hell did you do? </ i>
i didn't touch it .
bullshit !
i have this programmed on my favorite stations on a timer .
can i please have some time with my son?
i want to show him an article i have here on marketing internship .
you see this?
that's great , mom .
it's right up my alley .
but it is .
it's a new hot ...
i sent this to you .
why don't you ever listen to me ...
have you seen this system?
state of the art .
we got speakers all through the house .
but listen to this .??
??
it'll be easier to talk now .
where did she come from?
<i> what's going on? </ i>
see , i wasn't making a joke .
what's her name?
i would like to discuss some curious findings .
who is this lady?
i found here in your apartment ... <i>a rather troubling</ i> <i>piece of evidence . </ i>
<i> [ brenda ]
what evidence? </ i>
do you recognize the handwriting , mr. markovski ...
excuse me , mr. silver?
<i> [ albert ]
this is silly .
let's go . </ i>
no .
<i> i wanna go . </ i>
could you please read the date for me?
november 17 , 1989 .
albert was nine .
this is his journal .
would you mind reading this out loud?
no .
please .
<i>this stuff doesn't matter . </ i>
<i>let's go . </ i>
<i>oh , my god . </ i>
i came home from school .
mom was in the kitchen with a strange lady .
mom told me to go back to my room .
i thought i was in trouble .
she closed my door and said , 'purree got hit by a car and killed . '
<i>" and then she took me back</ i> <i>to the lady in the kitchen ... </ i>
<i>" and told me to spell words</ i> <i>to show how i'm a good speller . </ i>
<i>" i said i had to go</ i> <i>to the bathroom . </ i>
<i>" i climbed out the window . </ i>
<i>i went down the block . </ i>
<i>" i saw barney playing punch ball . </ i>
<i>he said i look sad . </ i>
i told him what happened to my cat .
he said , 'that's sad . '
then i cried , but i tried not to show .
some of the kids laughed .
barney said he cried when his dog died .
and the kids stopped laughing .
his cat died .
he was sad .
what's your point?
nothing strikes you as odd?
<i> see?
it's nothing .
let's go . </ i>
these things happen .
<i>oui .
c'est vrai . </ i>
the universe is cruel .
but tell me this , mrs. silver , this lady you gave the coffee to ...
was helen's sister .
i don't remember her name .
i met her the once .
was there some painful thing about this stranger ... that required your immediate attention?
no .
helen wasn't home , so i offered her sister a cup of coffee .
but you agree that purree meant a great deal to albert?
you can't make a federal case out of the cat .
answer the question , please .
i don't know much about the cat .
i traveled a lot for work .
we're not talking about this anymore .
it's embarrassing me .
<i> [ caterine ]
precisely the point . </ i>
<i> [ brenda ]
what? </ i>
you were embarrassed for feeling sad about the death of your cat .
it's painful enough to feel sad , but on top of it ... to feel embarrassed for feeling , that is the killer .
how is that my fault?
i didn't tell him to be embarrassed .
but you did .
it was more important to have a cup of coffee ... <i>with a perfect stranger</ i> <i>than to talk to albert ... </ i>
<i> about what for a small boy is a large tragedy . </ i>
<i> this is ridiculous . </ i>
<i>he climbed out his window, </ i> <i>a criminal in his own house . </ i>
<i> why? </ i>
i don't know .
i think you do .
i don't .
yes , you do .
oh , stop it !
i think you should go .
no , i will not go .
albert has a place here , a place you have denied .
this is my home .
i can tell him what i want .
<i> yes , your home is a lie . </ i>
what does that mean?
i gave my life to this selfish bas ...
<i>so he could be</ i> <i>an ornament to you , not a person . </ i>
<i> [ doorbell rings ] </ i>
<i> god , what are you , a bitch? </ i>
<i>you're a bitch . </ i>
<i>how many kids do you have , bitch? </ i>
listen .
listen .
this is your mother .
you asked me to come up here?
what does the doorman have to do with this?
he was orphaned by civil war .
you were orphaned by indifference .
this is but one part of your puzzle .
do you see?
<i> [ machine clicks ] </ i>
<i>?
<i>oh , now the timer's</ i> <i>all fucked up .
brenda . ! </ i>
<i>gee , is it that hard? </ i>
<i>go ahead and do it . </ i>
all i'm gonna do is listen ...
i spent what?
i spent $2, 000 on this?
i wanna listen to a radio !
i wanna listen to a radio !
<i>[ elevator dings ] </ i>
<i>thanks .
we'll meet you later</ i> <i>by the rock . </ i>
i'm sorry , man .
i need , like , a minute to figure this out .
<i> she had to get you to see . </ i>
see what?
you were trained to betray yourself right here .
that's why you betrayed yourself by going to brad .
<i>why didn't you figure this out? </ i>
<i>why didn't you bring me here? </ i>
because you lied to us .
you told us that the african guy ... was the ... the doorman at your friend's building , not at your parents 'building .
you encrypted the truth .
that's how good you are at betraying yourself .
right .
i told you that he wasn't ready for infinity .
don't start with that magic blanket bullshit , okay?
it's not magic .
it's just the way things are .
you and me and the air are actually tiny particles ... that are swirling around together .
look right here .
you see?
okay .
but look at the cracks ... between these particles and the cracks we fall through , the holes of nothingness .
exactly .
because that's what i just experienced upstairs .
look closer .
there are tiny particles connecting the larger cubes .
yeah , and then tinier cracks between the connections .
and even tinier connections .
and even tinier cracks .
yeah , but if you look close enough , you can't tell where my nose ends ... and space begins , because they're unified .
see?
so what?
you can't see any of this anyway !
do you see anything?
no .
but i want to debate this particle cube thing .
you live all the time with things you can't see .
you can't see electricity , can you?
you can't see radio waves , but you accept them .
trust .
fuck trust !
you better stay away from caterine , albert ...
'cause she's gonna lead you down the path of darkness .
she was our prize graduate student till she went astray .
i think that i am gonna stay with her , the cracks , the pain , the nothingness ... because that's more real to me , that's what i feel .
word .
okay .
we're not sweatin 'it .
no , we're gonna work with brad .
it'll all come back to you ...
and interconnection .
brad?
are you kidding me?
i'm gonna work on that prick , and it's all gonna come back to pain and no connection !
no .
it's on .
we'll see .
we'll see .
ooh , damn .
come on .
oh , shit .
fuck .
oh , look at this .
kafka .
<i> he's planting garbage for us . </ i>

<i> kafka . </ i>

so fishy .
<i> [ voices on headphones ] </ i>

whoa .
whoa .
i'm not unhappy to be with you !
let me see this !
putting on a show .
can't say no .
inside i'm drowning , sighing and frowning .
that doesn't sound very happy to me .
does it sound very happy to you?
i only wrote " frowning " to rhyme with " drowning .
then why did you need " drowning "?
to rhyme with " frowning .
there ...
there's nothing in it .
what does that mean?
look !
and why do they have to go through our yard and go through the garbage?
<i> what is he doing?
stop that . </ i>
why is he sniffing my blouse?
perspiration levels indicate stress , and that's kind of high .
<i> [ dawn sighs ] </ i>
<i> brad signed a rather comprehensive contract ... </ i> <i>allowing unfettered access</ i> <i>to your home . </ i>
well , it's my home too , and i didn't sign anything .

you don't believe in therapy .
no , see , i don't see this as therapy .

no , hey .

hey !
hey !

now , unfettered access .

the paragliding?
a quick look at your label .

no , it's not like that !

no , it is .
everything will end up nice .

they can help me .
help the open spaces .
help huckabees .
<i> what are you talking about? </ i>
he did mention that in his application ... that he felt exhausted from having to constantly charm everyone ... but doesn't see any alternative because ...
you need to get people to like you to be successful to get things done in this world .

ms. campbell , how have you felt about being pretty?
oh , please .
i don't think of myself as being that pretty .
yes , that's changed at huckabees , but , you know ...
i was never the pretty girl .
really?
<i> no . </ i>
i just have to keep up with this gorgeous hottie .

the sex?

you watched us?
no , just listened .
<i> [ brad ]
so , your surveillance is wrong . </ i>

it's quantity , not quality .
what?
she meant quality , not quantity .
<i> i know .
i was onlyjoking . </ i>
were you joking ...
when you said quantity and not quality?
in regards to sex?
we're not gonna discuss this .
we're private about ...

why is marriage and kids so important?
there's an overpopulation problem .
<i> [ bernard ]
whoa . </ i>
that came out of left field .
<i> all right . </ i>
why is having children the ultimate performance for successful people?
why?
well , it doesn't have to be a performance .
you know , we don't have to have kids .
we could just , you know , think about it , or not .
could just be ourselves , jet skiing , whatever .

it it's just ...
i ...
i ...
i don't know .

it's like i'm a rock or a dish of mold .
i'm whatever else is around .

yes .
<i> do it again .
do it again . </ i>
<i> now . </ i>
careful , my young students ... you cannot stay in this state all day .
<i> why not? </ i>
yeah , why not?
it is inevitable that you are drawn back into human drama .
desire , suffering ... everything that exists in this imperfect world .
shit .
so we get drawn back into human drama ... and how important we think that is .
then we do crazy stuff .
we have to go back to the ball ... so we can get the freedom of being like a ... like a dish of mold .
yes .
and then back to the drama , the suffering .
it's kind of a crappy deal .
<i> c'est exactement ca . </ i>
an absurd theatrical we must play out , back and forth ... from pure being to human suffering .
but isn't the drama and suffering less if we do the ball thing every day?
don't call it " the ball thing .
call it " pure being .
doesn't the pure being , ball thing make the day to day suffering easier?
yeah .
no , it doesn't .
you're wrong .
we're gonna do this every day .
we'll show you .
it'll make it easier .
i'll prove it to you .
human drama is inevitable .
suffering cannot be diminished .
you cannot escape , tommy .
you'll see .
existence is a cruel joke ... that entices in a form of desire .
absurd theater of desire .
i know , buddy , it hurts .
it's painful .
wait here .
where you goin '?
to meditate on desire and suffering .
can i come?
no .
okay .
i'll see you in a little bit .

is that why you're doing this , to teach me?
yeah , is that why you're doing this , to teach him?
<i> of course it is . </ i>
there are unique moments when two people share the deep sorrow of existence .
all right .
that's what i wanted to hear .
<i> how can you believe that bullshit? </ i>
t tom ...
tom , i'm sorry .
<i>this just happened . </ i>
<i>i've never done anything like this before . </ i>
<i> we could still be ...
you can</ i> <i>still be my other , right? </ i>
shut up , albert .
<i>i brought you here .
i wanted to share</ i> la force <i>with you , and you ruined it . </ i>
you fell in love .
<i> [ caterine ]
do not defile it with clich . </ i>
it is unnameable .
yeah?
well , i reject unnameable !
<i>[ clattering ] </ i>
it leaves me out !
<i>where is your pure being now , tommy? </ i>
<i>i told you . </ i>
i'm just gonna accept my loneliness .
and i'm gonna go to an even darker place of nothingness .
from an even farther , more extreme nothingness on my own !
who needs you guys?
<i> [ caterine ]
ahh , sublime . </ i>
<i>hey , welcome . </ i>
<i>you like my new office? </ i>
let's start with the method .
let's start with the method .
we'd like to discuss ...
we'd like to discuss ...
okay .
what are you doing?
okay .
what are you doing?
what are you doing?
i'm jokin 'around , guys .
but seriously , i want to quit the process with you .
nothing personal .
i appreciate what you've done for me , but i'm over it .
you can't quit until the case is over .
ah , i can fire you .
no , you can't .
no , you can't .
sure i can .
no , you can't .
paragraph 201 .
neither client nor detective ...
may terminate case prior to resolution as defined by paragraph 314 , subclause 'd '...
which states ...
that's not binding .
oh , it's binding .
i'll find a lawyer .
<i> oh? </ i>
or maybe even go to the fbl .
how about that?
<i> go ahead . </ i>
oh , i will .
i'm not kidding .
no , brad , this is how it works .
you go to the police .
you ...
you tell them that you went to the existential detectives .
<i>they ask why . </ i>
<i>you say , " for personal reasons . " </ i>
or , maybe you wanted to work the politics at your corporation ...
by rattling albert markovski .
i never told you that .
well , give us a little credit .
the police go to huckabees .
they talk to them .
the board learns that rising star , brad stand ... has weird existential issues .
<i> or he fakes them . </ i>
which is odd .
which is worse .
and your girlfriend , the voice of huckabees ...
is dressing like an amish bag lady .
okay , i get it .
you know , brad , suddenly your star isn't rising anymore .
it's sinking .
okay .
i said i get it , bernie .
relax .
<i> passive aggressive . </ i>
shut up .
aggressive aggressive .
does dawn want to quit?
<i> dawn's into this crap for real ... </ i> which is the stupidest thing i've ever seen in my life .
<i>shall we get back</ i> <i>to the case? </ i>
all right .
what you got on me?
nothin '.
our staff did a little field work in , uh , cleveland .
<i> what?
talk to my family? </ i>
<i> [ vivian ]
mommy and daddy look awesome . </ i>
so do you .
but this guy .

ah , he doesn't look too good .
<i> you bastards . </ i>
<i> [ bernard ]
he doesn't</ i> <i>look too good , does he , brad? </ i>
how could you do this?
<i>[ crying ] </ i>
ooh .
mm hmm .
are you kidding me?
he weighs 250 .
he t ...
he talks about geckos all the time .
what's the point?
i thought he was a sweet , sensitive young man .
oh , excuse me .
you ...
you spoke to my fat , sad brother?
<i> yes , brad , on the phone . </ i>
indeed , i did , at length .
well , if he's so sensitive , why doesn't he lose 70 pounds and stop talking about geckos .
maybe he'll find some friends .
<i> well , your brother feels</ i> <i>that you're ashamed ofhim . </ i>
are you sympathetic to him?
are you kidding me?
i gave him a car .
<i> [ bernard ]
mm hmm . </ i>
i send him shirts .
<i> mm hmm . </ i>
i ...
look .
here , guys .
geckos .
and i keep 'em .
i'm a pretty good older brother .
<i>[ vivian ]
he wishes you would</ i> <i>listen to him more . </ i>
about what , geckos?
i ...
i don't have all the answers .
but maybe he should listen to me more and learn a little .
<i>[ vivian ]
you have several stories that</ i> <i>you like to tell over and over and over . </ i>
ohh .
oh ho .

you're a funny guy , a good guy .

a dexicorp mall in my grandfather's forest is not exactly a win .
and they've already started surveying to ... to start construction .
we saved the marsh .
<i> [ albert ]
by giving them the woods . </ i>
are we going up or what?
<i>all you did was make huckabees look good . </ i>
<i>that's all you did . </ i>
albert , how can you be calm?
did you hear what brad did?
i'm dealing with it .
sit with me and shania .
you'll see this is a win for us .
shania doesn't give a shit !
oh , shania cares .
let's go !
shania doesn't give a shit !
we saved the marsh ...

<i> so you sold out the woods? </ i>

<i>brad , do you realize</ i> <i>when they destroy the woods ... </ i>
no , let me explain . the average temperature of the marsh rises five degrees?
the entire food chain is degraded , starting with frogs .
let me explain .
let me explain .
okay , but we saved half the woods .
i'm a vegetarian , brad .
i eat tofu tuna .
<i>with the mayo, </ i> <i>and you liked it . ! </ i>
shania , i'm albert .

you hurt my feelings .
i'm sorry .
but you had to do it anyway , didn't ya?
she's a very powerful person .
and i haven't been with a lot of women .
obviously .
and she used me to teach <i>us</ i> about the inevitability of human drama .
so?
is that where you get off the ride?
hell no .
i didn't think so .
looks like you saw some truth .
looks like you saw some truth .
what'd you see?
well , the interconnection thing is definitely for real .
it is !
i didn't think it was .
i can't believe it .
it's so fantastic !
that's amazing .
i know .
but it's also nothing special .
yeah , because it grows from the manure of human trouble .
you see , the detectives , they just wanted to gloss right over that .
but in fact , no manure , no magic .
did you hear some of that?
some of it sounds pretty good .
i think ...
i think this case is closed .
is it ever really closed?
hmm .
what are you doing tomorrow?
i was thinking about chaining myself to a bulldozer .
do you want to come?
what time?
mm , 1 : 00 , 1 : 30 .
sounds good .
should i bring my own chains?
we always do .
