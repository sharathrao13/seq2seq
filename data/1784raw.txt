your eyes out there
your eyes in the sky
your eyes dwell
your eyes in mine
your eyes , your eyes
make
make my eyes better
like flames
that devour darkness
like rain that wets
what is hidden
your eyes , your eyes
make
make my eyes better
your eyes now
your eyes are born
your eyes look at mine
your eyes , they're yours
your eyes , your eyes
make
make my eyes better
i've been thinking about internet ... and about all means of communication .
think about the speed of information ... how it reaches each one of us , ok?
and how it affects our lives .
now i'd like to ask you if you know what globalization is ...
what time does the bell ring?
what a good question .
a question that makes us think .
so , how is dalva doing?
she's okay , bothering as usual .
look at those kids over there .
the cops !
cops !
stop !
stop right there !
freeze !
police !
take off the bag !
get the sweatshirt off !
don't move !
freeze .
you vandal , where's the stuff?
hands up !
where's the stuff?
you shit !
look how we found out we raised a criminal .
say something to your father .
say what?
you being a wise guy?
no .
then say something , spit it out , talk !
promise your father you'll never see lobo and the others again .
tell him .
i'll mind my own business , you can be sure .
so , tell us all about it , you got fucked in the ass , right?
what 's the matter?
you're playing tough because bel is here?
tell us what a night in jail is like .
anyone home?
give me a fucking break !
get off his back , lobo .
jail was nothing .
my father was the problem .
the man is pissed off !
" father was the problem " .
you're late again , it 's always the same story !
this isn't a hotel , you've got no respect for your mother? !
is that any way to behave?
pick up your stuff !
what 's this?
oh , my god .
what did i find?
a joint !
a joint !
who knows how long he's done this .
weren't you ever aware?
no !
he's always deceived us .
you know what happened to me?
i got scared !
alright , i don't want you to get so upset .
how can't i be upset? !
let me handle this .
everyone will say he's a junkie .
calm down , i'll find a solution .
it 's good you mentioned .
i remember once we went to the stadium ... he was totally spaced out and i asked him if he had been drinking .
you always let him have his way !
we let him?
what 's the matter?
nothing .
then why are you on the floor?
just relaxing .
i'm visiting a friend in the hospital .
want to come with me?
can i drive?
alright .
what 's going on?
let go of me !
dad !
what 's going on?
dad !
wait a minute .
let me get this off .
relax , man .
what 's going on?
you need some tests .
i'm not sick .
where is my father?
right outside , just calm down .
i just want to know what 's going on .
are you army?
no , don't worry .
what 's your name?
neto .
neto , then what?
wilson souza neto .
your father thinks you're an addict and brought you here for treatment .
it 's a mistake , i'll call him to ...
listen , do you smoke dope?
no .
your father says you do ...
he found a joint in your sweatshirt pocket .
so?
do you smoke or not?
sometimes , but i'm not an addict .
your father says you are .
your parents say you're not acting normal .
i want my father's own words .
no , wilson .
here's how things stand ... you father has hospitalized you for disintoxication .
i'm not an addict .
if i was used to doing heroin ...
those in here for heroin once began with pot .
i don't shoot up and pot isn't addictive .
the field of medicine says otherwise .
what 's that?
i won't take this .
i'm here to visit a friend of my father's ...
i'm not an addict , you haven't even examined me !
take it easy .
you're hurting my arm !
i told you to stop !
stop it !
calm down , wilson .
relax .
fuck !
that 's it .
calm down .
did you fall?
come here !
did you fall?
you sleep here?
i sleep over there .
my friends sleep all here .
what 's your name?
i'm cear .
you came here , want to get out?
want to get out?
what 's your name?
your name !
neto .
come with me , neto .
let 's go .
this way , let 's go out .
don't you want to?
i'm not waiting for you .
i'm going out .
i'm not waiting for you .
this way , neto .
i'm going out .
you've got lots of friends out here .
it 's sunny out .
this is it .
are you hungry?
stay close to me , this way .
neto is here , he's my friend .
they're all my friends , too .
they are all my friends .
the ones over here , too .
hungry?
i'll get you a banana .
i'll give him this banana .
for him .
you won't eat , will you?
give me a cigarette .
leave him alone , he doesn't have cigarettes .
you don't have any , right?
get going , move .
good morning , wilson .
eat and go into the courtyard , it 's a beautiful day .
i have to talk to a doctor .
you will , in due time .
when?
for now , have some coffee .
doctor cintra comes almost every day .
but i have to see him right away .
then behave yourself .
move .
a cigarette ...
to sit there , you must ask permission .
may i?
at least drink the milk and coffee .
champ , take your pills .
what are they?
it 's part of the treatment .
i still haven't been examined .
dr. cintra wrote everything down .
your parents say they've always had open dialogue with you .
and you deceived them .
dialogue ...
i won't take anything .
you're making things worse .
i'll have to refer this to the doctor .
and he will confirm what 's in the medical record ... you are rebellious and aggressive .
take it .
it 's just a tranquilizer .
you'd better be calm to talk to dr. cintra .
sexy , isn't she?
rogerio .
neto .
rogerio , here !
i got it from the nurse , a cigarette for you .
is this your first time here?
it sucks .
why are you here?
heroin .
how long have you been in here?
five months .
who brought you here?
papa ...
mama ...
auntie ...
everyone , wasn't it?
your whole family , right?
stick out your leg !
i'll try a jump .
stick out your leg .
look !
here i come !
did you try to run away?
you can't , it 's worse than a prison .
you'll be here a while .
the hell i will .
if i don't see the doctor today , i'll beat up one of the nurses .
you're just begging for " tortulina " .
what 's that?
cear , come here .
show him the dance .
it 's a shot of haloperidol .
gives you muscle cramps , hurts like hell .
can bust your veins too .
if you get too much ... you end up like that guy over there , that big one .
whoever goes to the shore , honey
will never return again
the ocean wave takes

whoever goes to the shore , honey
will never return again
whoever goes to the shore
will never want to return again

save your anger for when he burns your balls .
go to hell .
he does the electric shock !

you're awake , aren't you?
look at me .
i'll sing you a song .
she gave away my radio without telling me
yes , she gave it away !
she did it for revenge
gave it away for free the radio that i bought
the doctor !
you don't want me , right?
at last .
there's been a misunderstanding .
turn around .
breathe deeply and hold it .
breathe now .
hold it .
breathe out .
again .
hold it .
again .
breathe out .
i tried to talk to you .
i tried to talk to you ...
doctor !
she gave away my radio without telling me
yes , she gave it away she did it for revenge
gave it away for free the radio that i bought
it was a gift
when my father finds out , i'm out of here .
forget it .
there's something in the medicine , makes you feel hungry .
when your mother visits , you'll be as fat as a pig .
she'll think you're doing better than when you got here .
doesn't matter what you say , she won't let you leave .
you're always in a bad trip .
you're crazy , man .
cear , let 's have a shower !
yes , wash me .
you got me all wet !
wash me ...
why are they all dressed up?
it 's visitor's day .
today?
your family isn't coming .
why not?
they can't .
the visits begin after 15 days .
by that time you'll be nice and fat .
rogerio?
let 's go , let 's go .
we have exactly 472 patients .
that won't be a problem .
we'll make it to 5oo , if that 's the concern .
we'll look under bridges to find patients .
we mustn't lose government funding .
everything is ready .
you have my trust , we mustn't be left out .
keep me informed .
alright , goodbye .
i wanna know where you are , who you're with !
what are you?
you smoked a joint !
answer me !
what are you?
bite .
ready?
1oo1 , 1oo2 ... 1oo3 .
a tree
can be called a bird
it can be called a machine
it can be called a carnival
a carnival
i think it 's not worth working for 2 or 3 years as a social servant .
as we're doing here .
and how am i to do?
it'll be as i'm saying .
this week , as soon as the results come out ...
as i told you on the phone ... the boy must remain in hospital for disintoxication and rehabilitation .
but how long will the treatment take?
that depends on how he responds to the treatment .
will it be days or weeks?
months , i'd say .
you need to understand we're not treating just his drug addiction .
mostly , it 's his personality disorder .
in modern medicine , everything is possible .
please , excuse me .
when you see the boy , he'll show an aggressive behavior .
his hallucinations can worsen , he might even complain about abuse ... and ask you to help him .
if you really want to help him , you must be firm .
don't play his game .
my son ...
i have to get out of here , mom .
today , okay?
you've gained weight .
no , it 's the medicine .
they give us medicine to stimulate our appetite .
you look so well .
i can call someone ...
don't call anyone , sit down .
it 's the medicine .
sit here with your mother .
don't exaggerate , don't be so drastic .
you're better , you no longer look as thin as someone with alds .
all this is fake , it 's hell in there .
madmen caked with shit , full of sores , it 's horrific ...
you have to be patient , you'll be more well balanced .
patience?
you're not in here !
she's not a junkie .
she doesn't need to be here .
me neither .
pot isn't addictive .
that 's not what the papers say .
it 's addictive to the point ... that people who smoke begin stealing to sustain the addiction .
i don't want my son in the headlines .
what a lovely , peaceful garden , i really liked this place .
they're pumping me with medicine .
dr. cintra ... is one of the best psychiatrists in brazil .
he's written lots of books .
what he does is for your own good .
he's a son of a bitch !
he didn't examine me ... ... and he's filling me with drugs .
not drugs !
medicine !
drugs are what you took out there .
no more fighting .
it 's hard to believe , we're so near the city .
makes you feel like staying here .
go right ahead !
she doesn't need to , she's not a junkie .
stop this , i can't take it anymore !
neither can i !
mom , they give electric shock to the patients , i'll get it too .
don't talk like that .
do you think it 's easy to find a place in a hospital like this?
we managed because your sister knows people !
and why?
to help you , to do you a favor .
i'm flying a plane , okay?
let 's go .
even the devils in white respect this man .
it 's to keep you warm here .
you must pretend .
who doesn't do that in this world?
who?
you have to say you feel good , you're not hungry ... you've got no toothache , you're not afraid .
otherwise , it 's impossible .
no doctor ever told me that hunger and poverty ... can lead to madness .
if you don't eat , you get touchy .
if you see your loved ones without food you can go mad .
a broken heart can lead to madness , the loss of someone you love ... if your most beloved leaves you .
we must even pretend to be mad being madmen ... and pretend to be poets , being poets .
go over there and read .
the hole in the mirror has closed
now i'm prisoner here
with one eye open , the other alert
to the other side where i fell
this side's got no access
even if they call me by name
even if a return is permitted
at my approach , the door disappears
the window vanishes into the wall
words of water dissolve
in the word thirst the mouth craves
before it's uttered it's not heard
i tried sleeping whole nights 4 , 5 , 6 in the morning
now i'll sit on this chair
with one ear alert and the other straining
the hole in the mirror has closed
and now i'm locked in here
abandoned by abandonment
locked in from the outer side
eat it , it 's for you .
don't you want it?
he doesn't want to eat .
it 's for you , pisca ...
ednei !
someone got away !
tie him up .
careful of his face .
tie him .
calm down .
ready , doctor .
bite .
ready .
1oo1 , 1oo2 ... 1oo3 .
wilson , you've got a visitor .
an unexpected visitor .
come .
your mother and i miss you very much .
i've never seen your mother so sad .
it's tearing me apart .
your sister called dr. cintra .
he said you were getting better and ...
get me out of here ...
get me out ...
get me out ...
get me out ...
when being alone
stay alone
be alone
your father and i will ask what to do to get you back in school .
you're feeling better , aren't you?
of course you are .
i don't want to go back to school .
why don't you?
i can't .
of course you can , what do you mean?
i can't !
we'll think of something else , i'll speak to your sister .
she says she can get you a job as a salesman in her company .
what do you say?
i'd rather you go to school .
i can't , mom !
you can't treat your mother like this .
she's got high blood pressure and is on tranquilizers .
what do i have to do to get the job?
the approach is fundamental because in that moment ... the person will evidence his fears , his insecurity and vulnerability .
every client is different ... and for each one the approach must be different .
our first job here is to investigate .
who is this person?
what are his greatest fears?
in this way we discover his needs .
a good salesman knows what button to push .
do you know the story of achilles 'heel?
in our field , everyone has their achilles 'heel .
only often it 's not the heel .
it can be the intestine , the heart or the liver .
one thing is certain .
everyone has a weak point .
have you seen bel?
the girl is beating all records .
she'll be at mario's party next saturday .
it'll be great , wanna go?
honey?
what is it , mom?
come in here , i have to tell you something .
i told you i don't want him here .
it 's the last time .
look at me .
do as i tell you .
tell him to go now .
sorry , but my mother doesn't want you to come here anymore .
i'm sorry .
do you think it's easy to find a place in a hospital like this?
it's to do you a favor !
do you think it's easy to find a place in a hospital like this?
do you think it's easy?
to help you !
leninha?
how are you?
fine , and you?
i don't believe this .
cintia , how i missed you .
i lost your number , i really wanted to talk to you .
i'll write it down for you , get a pen .
take care , kid .
hello , hello !
what a surprise !
how are you?
fine , and you?
here's the number , call me .
i'll call you tonight .
i really have to talk to you .
aren't you buying anything?
no , not today .
let 's go?
say i see my doctor and ask for a reimbursement later , can i?
i think so .
yes or no?
yes .
if i want a private room , what should i do?
no , that 's in a different plan .
which one?
the major plan .
what plan is that?
hey , son , going out so late?
where'll you go?
out for a walk .
it's just one more stone being smoked in the streets of a south district
just one more mind getting stoned stepping stones take you nowhere
wrong path , stone like flour
it'll stone you to death not fast but slow
it'll stone you hard
and to get out you have to be very tough
to get free , dump the drugs
and start a new life
heal the wounds you inflicted on yourself
pal , lift your head and try to understand me
it's hard , but you've got to survive
get out of this trap
stepping stones take you nowhere
a trap , a wrong path
stepping stones take you nowhere
a trap , a wrong path
stones kill !
a trap , a wrong path
stepping stones take you nowhere
a trap , a wrong path
stones kill !
what a rap , i think i'll die
got a millstone around my neck and don't know what to do
hello .
good evening , i'd like to speak to mr. wilson .
speaking .
this is the 22nd police precinct .
your son went wild at a party and reacted violently when we arrived .
since he was out of control , we had to handcuff and arrest him .
he keeps making no sense , and he has no self control .
his friends told us he's a little retarded ... and has been institutionalized .
we're sending him to a psychiatric hospital ... because he's totally uncontrollable .
what 's the matter?
what is it?
i don't like this room .
why not?
i don't want to be here .
why not?

when one starts , the others jump right in ... we can't lose control of the situation .
lose control of the situation?

maybe ... but from what neto told me , you were too rough .
if you don't control yourself , you're out , okay?
thanks a lot !
sit down and relax .

swallowed?
