you should never look back .
dudes , i actually graduated !
unless you're that guy .
i'm all right .
look , all i'm saying is ...
amanda and i are connected .
we have been , ever since the first day that she came to school .
oh , god .
here we go .
it was october , freshman year .
first fime in history thaf i'd ever missed the bus .
if i had arrived on time , i never would have seen her .
but as it was , i was the first person at huntingfon hills high ... to set eyes on amanda becketf .
it was her first day at school .
then i'm sitting in class , enjoying a late breakfast ... when suddenly , out of all the classrooms in the entire school ... she walks into mine .
and where does the teacher sit her?
right nexf to me .
now up until now , one could write this off to coincidence ... but then ... she reached into her bag ... and pulled out a strawberry pop tart ... the very same breakfast pastry that i was consuming at that moment .
what was i to do?
how was i to proceed?
who would like to volunteer to give amanda a tour of the school?
i will .
mike dexter .
that's where i lost her .
i had a clear shot , and i hesitated .
but fate's finally giving me a second chance .
well , have fun tonight ... and be sure to tell everyone how much i'll miss them .
you're not gonna go?
i can't believe you're not gonna go .
why would i go?
what else are you gonna do tonight?
i can't believe i'm going to this party .
i can't believe he broke up with her .
i can't believe you broke up with her , man .

women .
college women .
women with no curfew , women on the pill , and women

look , i am telling you ... that patch of sky right over there above those power lines ... is like a superhighway of u. f. o. activity .
i wonder how william's doin 'at the party .
i hope he isn't having any trouble blendin 'in .
wasn't there somethin 'i was supposed to do tonight?
i can't feel my legs .
i have no legs !
can i talk to you for a second , man?
well , did you do it or what?
man , we will .
i promise .
but her dad got us all tickets to see pearl jam .
so we're gonna do it after the concert .
i thought beth can kiss your ass .
come on .
mike , sometimes we say things we don't mean .
well , when's the concert?
august .
you guys suck .
but they're really good seats .
we're gonna deal with it eventually !
if you ask me , i never really saw you two together in the first place .
yeah .
you and me both .
what?
well , i know why i started dating him .
i just don't know why i did it for so long .
it's just god , at first , it was all so unbelievable .
and , i mean , at my old junior high school ...
i was always just this little , well , nobody .
and then i came to huntington freshman year ... and mike dexter wanted to date me .
and all of the sudden , i was , like , " little miss popular .
i know it sounds lame , but it felt good .
it's the first time i'd ever felt cool in my whole life .
please .
it was the first time i'd ever had a boyfriend .
i don't understand .
i mean , what happened?
nothing .
see , that's the problem because mike is the same guy now he was then .
you know , mooning the guy at the drive through window ... giving the underclassmen wedgies .
yeah .
i've heard he does that .
so why didn't you just , you know , break up with him?
'cause i was , um ... scared of being alone .
mike and i went out for , like , four years .
you know , that's , like , forever .
and if i'm not mike's girlfriend , you know , who am l?
nobody knows me as anything else .
i don't think i know me as anything else .
look ...
i don't know about you ... but i really believe ... that there's one person out there ... for everybody .
that's what this is about .
it's not just some sappy love letter telling her ... how my heart stops every time that i see her .
it's in there , but
it's not just to tell her how i think she's more than the homecoming queen ... or mike's girlfriend or ... how there's this really amazing person inside of her ... that no one even bothers to see .
it's in there , too , but ... what it's really about ... is how she should just give me a chance .
just one chance .
maybe we could find out if there's a reason for all of this why she's not with mike tonight ... and after four years , i'm still here with this letter .
maybe we could find out what that reason is .
you know ... it's time to find out .
i think i'm ready to do this .
finally .
any words of encouragement?
would you like to touch my penis?
i am a sex machine .
no one can hear us .
are you satisfied?
woman , this is all your fault .
bargin 'in here like a freakin 'moose , all
really?
well , if i'd known you were gonna be in here ... half naked , pleasuring yourself or whatever
don't touch that .
i definitely would have gone elsewhere .
i was gettin 'my shit ready .
your " shit .
yeah , 'cause for your information ... there is a supermad honey downstairs just waitin '.
she is dyin 'to have sex with me .
oh , jason , i never should have believed those rumors .
let's never fight again .
oh , never , baby .
hey , carl .
hey , preston .
what's up , man?
how are ya?
all right .
have you seen amanda beckett?
yeah .
i just saw her in there .
hey .
did you hear mike dexter broke up with her?
i'm thinkin 'about askin 'her out .
it's time to get freaky !
thanks for listening .
god , i got to be prom queen ... and now i want people to feel sorry for me too?
i should just shut up .
no .
it's okay .
i mean , you know , you need someone to listen .
thanks .
amanda , i feel really close to you now .
what are you doing?
oh , well , i care about you .
oh , will you get off?
come on .
it's okay , baby !
that is disgusting !
come on .
you were practically begging me for it .
that is not what i was saying .
and you're my cousin !
through marriage .
whatever !
you're sick !
shit .
you're not gonna tell my parents about this , are you?
you see the salt on this pretzel?

you used to sleep over my house .
you had to leave the hall light on every night .
you're kenny fisher who used to buy me a card every valentine's day ... and a bag of those little hearts with the words on 'em .
geez .
you're kenny fisher who got too cool to hang out with me in junior high ...
'cause i was in all the smart classes ... and 'cause my parents didn't make a lot of money ... and 'cause you desperately needed to sit at the trendy table in the cafeteria .

she's supposed to be with me .

it's sort of an emergency .
look .
it won't take long .
my car broke down and i need to call
shh !
wait .

hello?
yeah , mellow 103?
hello , 103 .
you're on the air .
finally .
listen ...
i have a really important question for barry manilow .
barry's listening .
in that song " mandy "
hello?
why did you do that?
wait a second .
lady , i was
i was talking to somebody !
no !
you don't just hang up !
rapid cabs .
hi .
i need a cab , please .
i'm at johnny's on the boulevard .
who are you?
i was
i'm an angel .
i had so
okay , i'm done now .
you don't just hang up on somebody's call like that .
i think my emergency was just a little bit larger than yours , junior .
how the hell do you know?
you have no idea how long
this is great .
this is just , just great .
this is officially the worst night of my entire life .
thank you very much .
try having 40 drunk men grabbing your ass ... one groom to be throwin 'up all over you ... and then have your car break down at 2 : 00 a . m .... and then you can talk to me about havin 'a bad night , okay?
you're a stripper?
i'm a dancer .
an angel stripper .
oh , i'm the weirdo .
you're the one calling barry manilow from a phone booth at 2 : 00 a . m .
you're right .
i'm a total loser .
no , wait .
i'm sorry .
great .
like i could feel any worse .
that's the most disgusting thing i've ever seen !
what is wrong with you people?
do you know who preston meyers is?
duh .
he only sat right next to you in freshman english .
but i guess you wouldn't remember that .
why would amanda beckett pay attention to a unique spirit like preston ... or even a unique spirit like me , for instance?
maybe it's because she's just a little too busy ... ordering around her little conformist flock of sheep .
sheep !
you are all sheep .
hey , luke doesn't push vader .
well , he should've .
i mean , the guy cut his hand off .
those were our only flashlights .
oh , yeah .
geez .
it's kinda dark up here .
yeah .
you know what?
this is just like that scott baio thing .
when i was 16 , i had the biggest thing for scott baio .
you don't have to sit here and go through scott baio?
i said i was 16 .
i mean , this went back to the " happy days " years ... not to mention " j oanie loves chachi .
god , i hated her .
joanie .
see , i always knew that somehow ...
i'd meet him .
like if i wanted it bad enough , i could make it happen .
and it did ... right after his first season of " charles ln charge .
he was doing this mall tour , and he came here to our mall .
it was like everything was finally falling into place .
you know , like it was  fate .
yeah !
so i went , you know .
and he had this red bandanna ...
'cause , you know , chachi always wore that red bandanna .
and i waited there outside .
and i was the first person when he pulled up .
he got out of that car
he was so beautiful .
and he looked right at me .
i didn't know what to do .
i couldn't say anything .
i couldn't move .
i never even talked to him , and he was right there .
i still have that red bandanna .
the thing is , you never know .
like , had i at least maybe said something .
you never know .
but anyway , the point is , i totally realized ... you know , fate .
there is fate , but it only takes you so far ... because once you're there , it's up to you to make it happen .
you are so definitely right .
i know .
so look .
don't make the same mistake i did .
if you really want to be with him , get back on that phone ... and call barry manilow and tell him how you feel .
i didn't want him .
it's okay .
i don't think it's weird .
i mean , come on .
scott baio .
we all have our things .
and i'm ready to fake
a chance again
ready fo put my love on the line
with you
you are a no talent , posturing little smurf !

that's not what your girlfriend said last night in your van .
you guys are such amateurs .
i quit !

'cause i'm gonna go .
you are disgusting .
i cannot listen to this .
so were you saving up all that stuff to tell me?
you really want to talk about this while you're doing that?
geez , it could've been on your mind the last six years .
you might've mentioned something .
when?
when you were ignoring me in the halls?
when you were writing " denise fleming's a tampon " on my locker freshman year?
i did not write " denise fleming is a tampon .
just like you didn't destroy my cabbage patch kid in second grade .
second grade?
besides , i admitted that right away .
no , you didn't .
when i picked her up , her head fell off , you started to cry .
that kind of tipped me off .
i did not cry .
much .
fine .
i told john keiserman to write " denise fleming is a tampon .
i felt really bad afterwards .
it's all right .
i told ...
diana yellin you were a dendrophiliac .
what is that?
it's someone who has sex with trees .
that's not funny .
oh , bill !
he's with me .
he asked me to hold his laser pointer .
now , ladies , ladies , please .
both of you can hold my laser pointer anytime .
come on .

william lichter?
yeah .
they're so lucky .
hey , man .

i thought college was gonna be a 24 7 orgy .
that's even why i broke up with janeen before i left .
so what happened?
college chicks are totally different , bro .
they're all serious and shit .
they all talk about world issues and " ecolomological " crap .
they all wanna date older guys .
yeah , but not all of 'em , right?

you're lookin 'good .
hey , amanda , do you want some watermelon?
amanda , i love you !
listen .
i know that must sound really strange , but
excuse me .
i've always felt there was this unspoken connection between us ... ever since the first time i saw you when you were holding my favorite pop tart .
and the truth is , i'm leaving tomorrow .
if we could go someplace
oh , you know what?
that is enough !
god , i haven't even been single for like five minutes ... and already you think ... that i am just gonna strip off my clothes and do you right here ... because , i don't know , i don't know ... you imagined that we shared some intimate moment that you ... have probably been drooling over for the past four years !
how sick and deluded are you?
you know , why don't you just go off and get yourself ... a goddamn life , asshole?
