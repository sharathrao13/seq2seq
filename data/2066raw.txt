since last week .
what do you want to see the most?
the smithsonian , of course .
the wright brother's plane , the apollo , the spirit of st. louis ...
look , i gotta go .
you get dressed .
breakfast is getting cold .
what's buzzing , cousin?
you're late .
well , if it isn't mr. burn nerd himself .
and his nerdette .
i'll get you in the minute you walk out the school .
you're dead meat .
please .
as you've all heard by now ... because of the budget crisis ... all the arts programs in public schools ... are to be canceled .
that means ...
i won't be with you after the break .
but , i do hope we keep in touch .
yes , kids .
the budget situation is serious .
even the football have to cut back a little .
but i do have some good news about the trip .
<i>our own, </ i> <i>richard bernard ... </ i> <i>has composed a brilliant piece and</ i> <i>you all will play at the white house . </ i>
<i>mr .
smith is confident, </ i> <i>given richard's genius ... </ i> <i>that this will inspire the president ... </ i> <i>to restore the arts program . </ i>
<i>maestro , please . </ i>
richard .
bernard .
mr. bernard?
do me the courtesy to let me finish , before you ask any quastions .
as i was saying ... it's clear we don't have the money this year for the class trip .
however , thanks to a donation of ten air tickets ... from the la symphony ... 10 of you will go .
we'll meet up with the other schools in washington .
now , mr. bernard ... what was so important that you needed to interrupt me?
smith ...
smithsonien " , sir .
i thought , coach , sir , tha it might misspelled , sir .
no biggie .
thank you , mr. bernard .
me and my big mouth .
no , you're just being spacey casey again .
and congratulations to our nine cougars .
what did he do now?
he's not a bad kid , you know that .
i know , this wasn't exactly ...
excuse me .
he gets in trouble because his head's in the clouds .
he can't stop daydreaming .
i'm sure you people have ... some fancy initials for it nowadays a disorder , but ...
this wasn't exactly his fault .
what do you mean " not exactly "?
coach davis doesn't care , he's just unfair .
right now , bruno's looking real unfair .
hey , chicken , what's clicking?
we'll miss you , ricky .
i'm sorry .
come on , let's go this way .
just come on .
no , not " choke " davis again .
that's what we call him .
that's what we call him .
he cost us the championship ... missed five foul shots in a row .
look , just because my son can spell and he can't .
if this is about the plain tickets , i can still get it for about 10 % ... from my job , my old job .
really?
well , then you can both come .
dad !
what are you doing?
you're here , dad !
you're going .
to washington .
and so am i.

on one condition .
so we have a deal , right?
dad , i'm not a kid anymore , those daydreams were kid stuff .
if you start to feel one coming on " snap out of it " .
i know it sounds silly , but that's how i quit smoking .
well , i cut it way down .
no , you didn't !
i'm going to .
the point is no more tall tales , all right?
i just don't want you to get hit by a car ... or get in trouble the way you do , some times , ok?
we have to live in the real world , richard .
yes , dad .
anyway , here's our exit , so ...
go ahead .
please , put your shoes here .
security brake !
what have we got here?
it's just his allowance .
allowance , uh?

thank you .
gate 28 , this way , let's go .

where are you going?
some bad stuff's going down , lieutenant .
i feel it .
hey , watch where you're going .
he's very sick .
sorry .
it's ok , don't worry about it .
what happened?
a heart transplant case ... overwork stressed out the business man .
but there's a compatible heart at john hopkins .
we only hope he'll stay alive for the next few hours .
nurse , we have to go .
sorry , kid .
snap out of it .
shashi , we can't take this plane .
what do you mean , jelly bean?
see that man?
the real ugly one .
who?
him?
he's not that bugly ugly .
he's got a gun , a pistol .
right here .
hey , i want no part on your stories , you hear me?
i've learned my lesson .
not another word on this .
not one .
fine .
how's a passenger going to get through security with a gun?
that's it !
a maintenance mas brings it in .
and gives it to him after going through security .
look there .
no , you're not getting me this time , ricky , no .
all right , let's go , the smithsonian's waiting .
come on !
the big trip is here .
i'm going to the bathroom .

you're not allowed two pieces of carry on luggage .
i'll stay with this up front .
got a handful here .
come on , guys .
there you go .
good .
ok .
is this going to be the flight from hell or what?
don't worry , it's past their bedtime .
they'll sleep the whole way .
what are you doing here , bernard?
you're not supposed to be here .
but you are a trombone short ...
are you questioning my intelligence?
yes , sir .
no , sir , i mean , no , sir .
we wouldn't wanna question his intelligence .
keep going .
i thought this was a simple budget matter , the things about the tickets .
well , not entirely .
not entirely for you .
look ... you and i know about disappointments in school ... and i wouldn't want him to let the team down , you know what i mean , choke?
sorry , coach .
find someone else's kid to pick on .
what a loser .
that's my seat .
no , it's not .
it's mine .
someone's gonna get hurt .
actually guys , that's my seat .
great , plenty of seats , you guys can sleep .
no wonder the company's going broke .
go ahead , grab any one you want .
oh , boy !
i wish i was in the first class .
me too .
i mean in the hips , not the ...
did you see how he looked around , checking everyone out?
do you wanna a pillow?
no , thanks .
can we go visit de cockpit?
i mean , later?
i'm sorry , we can't do that anymore .
security .
he's seen plenty of them with me .
so , you're a pilot?
no messing around .
on vacation , are you?
right , on vacation in washington .
not in the air , dad .
the cockpit?
the instruments , it's all the same as your computer program , exactly .
yeah , but , it's still not the same as flying for real .
<i>bravo , we have three aircrafts</ i> <i>at position 1 3 0 . </ i>
<i>mark position 1 2 0 1 2, </ i> <i>altimeter in 2 9 9 1 . </ i>

good evening , ladies and gentlemen , this is captain noonan .
we're at the head of the queue now , on our way to washington dc .
flying is 65 times safer than driving ... according to michigan transportation research institute .
what are you saying?
that we're lucky to make it to the aiport ... in the car?
ladies and gentlemen , we've reached our cruising altitude .
the ride is smooth , so i'll turn off ... the seat belt sign .
as always though ... we ask that whenever you're in your seat ... you keep it buckled down .
since most of us ... since you'll be sleeping ... we won't speak to you again until just before our arrival in washington .
<i>good night .
have a nice rest . </ i>
man , they better serve supper soon .
we should do something .
get real , ricky .
our lives could depend on it .
i don't wanna hear about it .
your daydreams always get us into trouble .
hi , ricky .
hi , mary jo .
shashi .
this is great , you made it .
did you know our coach's nickname in highschool ...
was " choke "?
i knew that already .
neat .
let's party , come on .
hey , small .
my hero !
let's move .
it's night , we can't see out anyway .
let's get more room .
are you all right?
yes .
i hate these things .
you're afraid of flying?
but you put these things together .
i can keep them flying , i just wish they'd never been invented .
it's not funny .
i guess it's a little funny .
don't worry , i'll be right next to you the whole time .
tha front is moving a lot faster than they forecast .
must be the one that's beating through texas .
see those pictures on news?
can we get above it?
i don't know .
call dispatch , get an update .
you got it .
he hasn't made a move yet .
i'm starving .
shashi , all i'm asking is that you take a look .
you see that bulge in the jacket?
it has to be the gun .
i hope they have a choice .
maybe fish .
what's this about a gun , nerdboy?
nothing .
hey , nerdette , what's this about a gun?
ricky says he saw a man , like a passenger , with a gun .
it was nothing , i was just kidding him .
a gun?
come on , that's important .
tell me .
ricky says that he saw ... a man with a pistol .
but , of course , he was just kidding .
i gotta go to the toilet .
the sweaty guy with the handkerchief?
yeah .
this is very serious , ricky .
we're in the same boat , same plane that is .
where did he have it?
yeah , i see the bulge .
you saw it for real .
yeah , i did .
you could be a hero , ricky .
save the plane .
come on , pal , we better check this out , show me .
no , i'm not going anywhere with you .
that guy has a gun back there .
just show me .
come on .
go , go .
you walk by , fall on him and trip for the gun , ok?
no way .
why don't you do it?
what can he do to you?
shoot me .
ok , just walk and look and see if you can see it inside his jacket .
you're going to the toilet and walking by , that's all .
go .
sorry , sorry , sir .
well , watch where you're going .
sorry , turbulence .
toilet ... yes , in front .
i saw it , i saw it , i did .
i sure felt it this time .
it's real reality , all right?
what do we do?
i'm not sure .
we gotta tell somebody .
like a grown up .
who?
no one will believe us .
yeah , we're just crazy kids , but we're safe , no?
the pilot has a gun , right?
i don't know .
he's locked in the cockpit .
the guy can't get in .
if we die , i don't wanna look back and wish we'd done something .
how do we put him out of action?
game is up , kato .
how did you find me?
that's a national security matter ...
i'm not authorized to discuss with scum like you .
only a scum with the highest security clearence .
give me your hot sauce case .
you hate spicy .
just ...
chicken or pasta?
pasta , please .
keep your trays down , thank you .
here you go .
be careful with that one ... if you're not used to it .
it's got a delayed kick .
we'll both have the pasta , please .
this is my job .
it looks good .
it might be my last meal .
hot , hot .
go ahead , you can eat .
what is he doing?
stop it , luke , eat your food .
use your words , honey .
do you want to throw up?
this is mild stuff .
if you'd used this , it would've killed him .
good we moved .
potty , go potty .
ok , baby , here we go .
trial run a success .
we need the strongest to take out the big monster .
which is it?
well ... with this ... you run the risk of being accused of murder .
it's self defense .
like a preemptive strike?
right , but , how do we get it into his food?
quick , the food cart's close to him .
come on .
you said we had to do something .
come here .
if we do them all , he'll get one .
we can't kill innocent people .
though , sometimes , you have to sacrifice a few to save the many .
chicken or pasta?
pasta .
give me pasta .
lost the top to my ... soda bottle .
actually , my contact lens .
here it is .
did you do any?
no , all i had was chicken .
but he took pasta , what do we do?
i don't know .
the concept was good .
the execution was lacking .
come on , like we're going to the bathroom .
you want something to drink?
stewardess , do you have any hot sauce?
i'm sorry , not in economy class .
the sauce is rather spicy though , and you have pepper .
he likes hot food .
not good .
call that spicy?
thanks .
food war !
<i>there's a food fight backe here . </ i>
<i>we need help . </ i>
did she just say food fight?
that's what it sounds like .
you better go check that .
stop right there , you little miscreants .
but , sir , we were in the toilet .
we just wanna get out the line of fire and go back to sleep .
quiet !
what's wrong?
someone had to complain about the airplane food .
back to your seats , please .
i'll call stickler , see if he wants the attendants up here .
right , the rules , can't be alone .
stickler , hannah's coming back , we need to in the cockpit .
that won't be necessary , sir .
i have everything under control .
so much for the food fight .
we're gonna hit that front any moment .
where's my food?
she must have taken it .
you stole my food !
serves you right .
i'll kill you !
get me?
you stole my food .
focus , ok?
we've got lives to save .
whether they deserve being saved or not .
not now , shashi .
you know what happens when i don't eat .
come on , heroes don't get hiccups .
focus !
i managed to find the hot sauce , sir .
hot .
i'm sorry , did you burn your tongue?
these microwaves are very uneven .
spicy .
spicy?
spicy !
men .
all talk .
say he didn't see us .
he didn't see us .
say it and mean it .
he saw us .
he's coming .
and he pointed at me .
and he reached in here .
for his gun?
yeah .
i think that did it !
no more ...

<i>ladies and gentlemen , we could be</ i> <i>running into a bit of turbulence . </ i>

jesus , you scared me !

where's shashi?
there's a hijacker with a gun .
we're onto him and he wants to kill us .
that sounds fun .
no !
go back !
it's that way .
this is exciting !
we're being bad .
get in there , go .
did you see them coming here?
no .
they must be back in economy .
i think they're here .
don't want you shooting them here .
you'll awake the first class passengers .
economy , that's different .
let's look there , if we don't find them ... we'll search here .
did i hear right?
shooting?
no .
they were just joking .
let's go .
what was that?
what?
stay there .
what?
stay there .
<i>is there a doctor on board? </ i>
<i>we have a medical emergency . </ i>
<i>please , present yourself</ i> <i>in the first class . </ i>
dr. r. bernard here .
i don't know if i can be of help .
i'm only a heart surgeon .
not " the " dr. bernardi of general memorial?
yes .
i'm just back from hawaii , first vacation in 10 years .
thank god , dr.
he's a heart patient .
dr. bruno , here , did his best , but he's only a ... small animal veterinarian .
i thought you said you were a large animal vet .
i fibbed .
our only chance to save this man's life is to operate immediatly .
do you have a medical kit?
yes , dr. , but ... security's removed any sharp instruments ...
like scalpels .
do you have any cutlery?
plastic .
that'll have to do .
two knives , one fork and a spoon .
wait , better make that three spoons .
right away , dr.
dr , can you save my father?
i can't be sure , young missy ... until i've opened up this sucker .
so , let's get cut .
that was close .
what do we do?
we could hide in the toilet .
been there , done that .
they'll look there first .
overhead racks?
we're too heavy .
they must be in first , like i thought .
we're almost there now , let me check to see where they are .
be careful .
they're coming .
follow me .
what's this?
a safe place .
how do you know all this?
my dad's taken me to maintenance a million times ... and shown me all over .
spooky .
he's back in first class .
did he see you?
no .
you sure?
no .
we better hide .
quick .
look at his neck , it's tangled up in that chain .
don't !
come here , come here .
easy .
it's ok .
it's ok , it's ok .
come on , hurry , let's go .
come on .
we can make like a little house , be totally hidden .
right .
here's a good one that can cover us like a door .
i know you're down here and you're in big trouble .
it sounds a lot like bruno .
that idiot .
that's all we need now .
help me !
help me !
thanks , guys .
are you ok?
yeah .
transglobal 40 , this is washington center .
<i>descend at pilot's discretion</ i> <i>to maintain 5 . 000 feet . </ i>
2 9 3 7 . </ i>
pilot's discretion to 5 . 000 , leaving 3 3 0 now .
you hear that?
we're starting our descent .
we're gonna make it .
only a few minutes more .
where are we?
we're almost there , we're heading down .
by the way , wasn't ricky sitting over there?
they probably found some place to lie down .
good boy .
he's coming .
just be still .
you sure?
darn , i was stupid !
we're trapped here .
we're well hidden .
i hope .
we're landing soon .
that can be the most dangerous time .
stay here .
stop it !
it's the incan mask .
the stolen mask .
he wasn't a hijacker .
he's a kidnapper .
what?
i don't understand .
didn't you hear about that girl who was missing?
well , there's a gold incan mask missing too .
that's it , i tell you .
is there a reward , do you think?
did he put it back in the suitcase?
no , i'm pretty sure he put in one of those black computer bags .
why?
why did he ...
of course !
if he had it in his handluggage it would've been seen by x ray .
but leaving the plane , nobody checks you .
and maybe there're others .
and he's double crossing them .
there's that flight attendant who's in on it .
we have to tell someone .
right .
this is different now .
i have the cell phone my parents gave me for the trip .
yeah , like call 911 , right?
no , that's not a bad idea .
kato's not getting off the plane until we land , that's for sure .
if we warn the pollice , they can be at the gate ... and check everyone leaving the plane .
we can tell them about kato .
reward time !
come on , it's not over yet .
go ahead and call them , mary jo .
first i have to see if it works .
911 .
<i> hello . </ i>
<i>i want to report a kidnapping, </ i> <i>attempted murder ... </ i> and the theft of the incan gold mask , the one that's been on the news .

make sure everyone's down .
no one .
what do we do now?
we start looking .
what are you doing up here?
you were supposed to be on your seats .
the capitain's given orders to buckle up .
sit , buckle up .
this is so against the rules .
your parents are gonna hear ...
never mind .
shashi , you go back to economy .
see if kato is back there .
go to my father and tell him about the mask .
nothing about the gun .
why don't you go tell him?
believe , he won't believe me .
why should i believe you if he won't?
believe me , just because he won't believe me ... doesn't mean you shouldn't believe me .
you saw it .
mary jo is more convincing .
she gets straight a's .
just do it .
i'll check here .
if it wasn't him , the person's probably in the first class .
could be business?
could be .

i'll go help shashi .
two is more convincing than one .
friends?

she came down to the baggage and took it and put it in a black bag .
he's crazy .
they told you was an old man , remember?
i tell you , this is ann dorchester .

here goes .
hand flying's harder than i thought .
<i>ricky , open the door . </ i>
unless we find a pilot on board , getting the door open won't help .
are there any pilots on board?
the captain requests assistance , just as back up .
anyone?
<i>current or not . </ i>
<i>good pay . </ i>
<i>early retirement . </ i>
maybe real early .
we have no takers .
what in the world is going up there , midge?
<i>auto pilot engaged . </ i>
transglobal 40 , do you read?
<i>whoever you are , please , respond . </ i>
i think he's coming too .

<i>do you read me? </ i>
<i>undo his belt . </ i>
<i>he'll make it with his pants off . </ i>
who's this?
get off this line .
this is an emergency .
i agree .
it's an emergency .
don't mock me , kid .
get off this line we were supposed to have ... the most secure communication system in the world .
<i>this is transglobal 40 . </ i>
the kid's obviously been listening .
he's some sort of hacker .
i've got more than 50 souls on board .
<i>my database says that ... </ i>
<i>andrews air force base</ i> <i>is the best option . </ i>
wait a minute , the pilot said he saw kids in the cockpit .
good christ !
<i>whoever this is , identify yourself . </ i>
capitain richard bernard .
you're a pilot then?
yes , sir .
i've got over a thousand hours on the 777 .

my son has that program ...
and it's an excelent ...
wait .
the president's plane is about to land at andrews any minute , sir .
he's returning from his fund raising trip .
this is very suspicious , sir .
<i>i've got my junior pilot wings . </ i>
his what?
they come in a cereal box .
my son has one .
<i> andrews is out , whoever you are . </ i>
copy that .
passengers and crew , sir .
<i>the one in metro looks the best, </ i> <i>i suspect . </ i>
where's captain noonan?
he's out cold .
right here on the floor .
i told you .
i told you .
ok , let's talk .
just tell me what you and your people want .
i'm sure we can work something out .
get me a psych report on this one .
right away .
what i'd like is , you to put a qualified adult in line ... and give me some back up just in case .
a pilot who knows the 777 .
ok , richard , we're on it .
we're requesting you a pilot to assist you while we figure out a place to land .
<i>transglobal 40, </ i> <i>what's your fuel status? </ i>
4 . 600 pounds .
<i>they're here . </ i>
they've probably burned ... any reserve with that detour .
they should be more than ok to metro .
that's just what the kid said .
<i>change redio frequency now</ i> <i>to metro .
120 .
1 . </ i>
there's a pilot there to assist you .
this kid has a string unexcused absences from pt .
clearly some kind of a misfit .
<i>transglobal 40, </ i> <i>this is captain exupery . </ i>
<i>do you copy? </ i>
he's only got fuel enough for one pass , if that .
that's about 6 minutes from ... from now .
we're gonna need vectors to a straight in final approach .
whoever is talking , that's the right call .
roger that , transglobal 40 .
we're clearing all the runaways .
holding all traffic .
you're about 5 minutes out .
<i>emergency crew, </ i> <i>everyone on your position . </ i>
senator , we do not have take off permission yet .
the hell with that .
we have priority .
what's the use of being an us senator?
son , i'm on an official business .
we'll take off now .
that's an order .
yes , sir .
you're the boss .
that gives us one chance .
i can see you intercepting .
now engage autoland .
we've captured the localizer for runway one right .
i think .
we've got you .
runway one right .
it's ok , we're locked in ,
the plane will land itself .
i see the runway .
my god , look at this !
he's headed straight for them !
push the lever down on the top of the throttle !
<i>pull up , pull up ! </ i>
my god !
what was that?
<i> stall !
stall ! </ i>
hit that lever .
<i> stall !
stall ! </ i>
<i> hit that lever ! </ i>
what are you doing down there?
i had a landing !
is anyone in the tower?
son , you did a good job .
let's just try another coupling approach .
i don't if i've got enough fuel to do a whole approach .
son ... can you fly this aircraft manually?
for god's sake , no !
put him on auto .
he's just a kid .
he has no chance .
they can go down in town ...
just decide .
every second we lose ...
can you hand fly the plane , son?
i don't know .
<i>get her up to 600 feet . </ i>
<i>then sharp bank to the right . </ i>
<i>flame at right engine . </ i>
no , our right engine flamed out .
<i>turn now , and then line it . </ i>
330 degrees .
<i>that's it , boy . </ i>
<i>approaching the localizer . </ i>
<i>select autoland again . </ i>
<i>come on , select autoland again . </ i>
<i>are your flaps down? </ i>
what about the gear?
<i>very good . </ i>
<i>that's it , you're down . </ i>
<i>pull reverse thrust levers</ i> <i>all the way up . </ i>
<i>the brake pedals . </ i>
hit the brake pedals .
what a boy !
what a boy !
that's it !
yes , sir !
what a boy !
good job !
make that great job !
well done , junior pilot .
what happened?
it's ok .
it's ok , sir .
we've landed .
you did it , ricky !
i'm not gonna say anything else about you being spacey casey again .
a souvenir .
did you know they were on board with her?
no , it was just a lucky coincidence .
but it does show the value of having air marshals on board .
capitain , what happened?
it's her !
what you did was very ...
i'm so proud of you , son .
i guess you don't have to play football to be a hero .
you sure showed me .
i believe this is yours .
well , sir , this is one treasure .
but , the greater treasure is my daughter .
i owe you her life .
perhaps you don't know , but i announced a reward ... a sizeable reward for the return of both .
you're a wealthy man .
no , sir , the reward doesn't belong to me , but this gentle ... well ... this person .
thank you .
ok , no .
you're welcome but , it's my son , ricky ... who not only saved your daughter but all of us on the plane ... by landing it .
it's true , he did !
it was all of us .
if there's any reward , it should go to keep our arts program going ... keep our teachers teaching and us kids making music .
what did you say?
hands up .
turn .
what are you doing?
we should be on underway in a few moments now ... and we look forward to a smooth flight tonight .
bye bye .
