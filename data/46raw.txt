heil hitler .
indy !
here !
we've hit stone !
clear it off .
come on , find the edges .
good , good , good .
you see , lndy?
you see?
okay , bring the pry bars in .
as a team , boys !
as a team !
push !
get 'em in there .
get 'em under .
good , good , that's it .
watch your toes .
carefully , carefully !
sorry , lndy .
indy ... why does the floor move?
give me your torch .
snakes .
why did it have to be snakes?
asps .
very dangerous .
you go first .
if you're trying to escape on foot , the desert is three weeks in every direction , so please , eat something .
i must apologize for their treatment of you .
yeah .
whose idea was it?
no food , no water .
what kind of people are these friends of yours?
at this particular time and place , to do my work , they are necessary evils .
they're not my friends .
however , with the right connections , even in this part of the world , we are not entirely uncivilized .
it's beautiful .
i would very much like to see you in it .
i'll bet you would .
all right .
what do you got to drink around here?
we don't have much time .
soon they will come to harm you ,
soon they will come to harm you , and i will not be able to stop them , unless you are able to give me something to placate them .
some , uh , piece of information ... which i can use to protect you from them .
i've already told you everything i know .
i have no loyalty to jones .
he's brought me nothing but trouble .
marion , you are beautiful .
i don't think we need a chaperone .
steadily .
steadily .
whoa !
down ...
down whoa .
carefully , carefully !
you all right , lndy?
now gently , boys .
gently , gently !
whoa ...
i told you it will be all right .
huh ...
sallah , get down here !
you pour .
oh , that's good .
whoops .
what is this stuff , rene?
i grew up with this .
it's my family label .
well ...
i have to be going now , rene .
i like you , rene , very much .
perhaps we'll meet someday under better circumstances .
we meet again , fraulein .
you americans , you're all the same .
always overdressing for the wrong occasions .
now ... what shall we talk about?
all right ... take it up !
easy !
you're as stubborn as that girl .
you like her too much , i think .
your methods of archaeology are too primitive for me .
you would use a bulldozer to find a ...
china cup .
shliemann !
wake your men !
indy , the torches are burning out .
go on , get out of here .
hyah !
sallah !
hello !
hello !
why , dr. jones , whatever are you doing in such a nasty place?
why don't you come on down here !
i'll show you !
thank you , my friend , but i think we are all very comfortable up here .
that's right , isn't it?
yes , we are very comfortable up here .
so , once again , jones , what was briefly yours is now mine .
what a fitting end to your life's pursuits .
you're about to become a permanent addition to this archaeological find .
who knows?
in a thousand years , even you may be worth something .
son of a bitch .
i'm afraid we must be going now , dr. jones .
our prize is awaited in berlin .
but i do not wish to leave you down in that awful place all alone .
slimy pig , you let me go !
stop it !
marion !
hang on .
don't ...
lndy !
don't fall !
marion , i got you !
i got you !
i got you !
you traitor !
you get your hands off of me !
snakes !
oh , sh ... oh , at your feet !
the girl was mine !
she's of no use to us .
only our mission for the fuehrer matters .
i wonder sometimes , monsieur , if you have that clearly in mind .
it was not to be , ch? rie .
you bastards !
i'll get you for this !
indiana jones ... adieu .
no !
take this .
wave it at anything that slithers .
thank you .
oh , my god , this whole place is slithering .
indy !
ow !
jesus !
where did you get this?
from him?
i was trying to escape .
no thanks to you .
how hard were you trying?
well , where the hell were you?
watch it , watch it .
what are you doing? !
for the fire !
how the hell are we going to get out of here?
i'm working on it !
i'm working on it !
well , whatever you're doing , do it faster .
ah ...
where are you going?
through that wall .
just get ready to run , whatever happens to me .
what do you mean by that?
indy !
damn it !
don't you leave me down here by myself !
indy !
here we go !
get ready !
indy , the torch is going out !
indy?
marion !
look .
look .
they're going to fly it out of here .
when that ark gets loaded , we're already going to be on the plane .
ah , monsieur , let us toast our success in the desert .
to the ark .
when we are very far from here .
that will do .
hey , you now come here !
come here !
indy !
stay with the ark !
stay with the ark !
look out !
oh , my god .
marion .
in here !
up here !
indy , come on !
hold on !
move up !
it's gonna blow up !
it's stuck !
indy !
i can't push it off !
it's stuck !
turn it !
turn it !
it's stuck !
turn it there !
never mind !
get back !
get back !
get the ark away from this place immediately .
have it put on the truck .
we'll fly it out of cairo .
and gobler , i want plenty of protection .
jones .
holy smoke , my friends ,
i ...
i'm so pleased you're not dead !
indy , lndy , we have no time .
if you still want the ark , it is being loaded onto a truck for cairo .
truck?
what truck?
let's go !
get back to cairo .
get us some transport to england boat , plane , anything .
meet me at omar's .
be ready for me .
i'm going after that truck .
how?
i don't know .
i'm making this up as i go .
ew !
he's there !
idiot !
idiot !
everything at last has been arranged .
the ark?
is on board .
nothing is lacking , now that you're here .
or what is left of you .
you trust these guys?
yes .
mr. katanga .
mr. katanga , these are my friends .
they are my family .
i will hear of it if they are not treated well .
my cabin is theirs .
mr. jones ...
i've heard a lot about you , sir .
your appearance is exactly the way i imagined .
good bye .
look out for each other .
i am already missing you .
you're my good friend .
sallah .
that is for fayah ... that is for your children ... and this is for you .
thank you .
a british tar is a soaring soul
as free as a mountain bird
his energetic fist should be ready to ... ... a dictator ...
where did you go?
i'm cleaning up .
where'd you get that?
from him .
who him?
katanga .
i got a feeling i'm not the first woman ever to travel with these pirates .
it's lovely .
yeah?
yeah .
really?
yeah .
what'd you say?
wait ...
i don't need any help .
you know you do .
you're not the man i knew ten years ago .
it's not the years , honey , it's the mileage .
you are ...
please , i don't need a nurse .
i just want to sleep .
don't be such a baby .
marion , leave me alone .
what is this here?
go away .
yes , it hurts .
ow !
well , goddamn it , lndy , where doesn't it hurt?
here .
here .
this isn't too bad .
here .
jones ...
jones? !
we never seem to get a break , do we?
what is it?
engines have stopped .
i'm going to go check .
what's happening?
we have most important friends .
holy shit .
i sent my man for you .
you and the girl must disappear .
we have a place in the hold .
come on , go , go , go .
come on , go , my friend , go .
where is dr. jones?
what's the big idea?
let go !
don't you touch me .
what about jones?
there's no trace yet , sir .
jones is dead .
i killed him .
he was of no use to us .
this girl , however , has certain value where we're headed .
she'll bring a very good price .
mmm?
herr colonel , that cargo you've taken if it's your goal , go in peace with it , but leave us the girl .
it would reduce our loss on this trip .
savage !
you are not in the position to ask for anything .
we will take what we wish .
and then decide whether or not to blow your ship from the water .
the girl goes with me .
she'll be part of my compensation .
i'm sure your fuehrer would approve .
if she fails to please me , you may do with her as you wish .
i will waste no more time with her now .
excuse me .
i can't find mr. jones , captain .
i've looked everywhere .
he's got to be here somewhere .
look again .
i found him .
where?
there .
the altar has been prepared in accordance with your radio instructions , sir .
good .
take the ark there immediately .
monsieur ...
i am uncomfortable with the thought of this ...
jewish ritual .
are you sure it's necessary?
let me ask you this : .
would you be more comfortable opening the ark in berlin , for your fuehrer?
finding out , only then , if the sacred pieces of the covenant are inside?
knowing , only then , whether you have accomplished your mission , and obtained the one true ark?
hello !
jones .
jones !
i'm going to blow up the ark , rene .
your persistence surprises even me .
you're going to give mercenaries a bad name .
dr. jones ... surely you don't think you can escape from this island .
that depends on how reasonable we're all willing to be .
all i want is the girl .
if we refuse?
then your fuehrer has no prize .
okay , stand back .
all of you , stand back .
stand back .
okay , jones .
you win !
blow it up .
yes , blow it up !
blow it back to god .
all your life has been spent in pursuit of archaeological relics .
inside the ark are treasures beyond your wildest aspirations .
you want to see it open as well as l .
indiana ... we are simply passing through history .
this ...
this is history .
do as you will .
marion , don't look at it .
shut your eyes , marion .
don't look at it , no matter what happens .
ah ...
it's beautiful !
indy?
don't look , marion !
keep your eyes shut !
marion .
you've done your country a great service , and we thank you and we trust you found the settlement satisfactory .
oh , the money's fine .
the situation's totally unacceptable .
well , gentlemen ,
i guess that just about wraps it up .
where is the ark?
i thought we'd settled that .
the ark is somewhere very safe .
from whom?
the ark is a source of unspeakable power and it has to be researched .
and it will be , i assure you , dr. brody ,
dr. jones .
we have top men working on it right now .
who?
top men .
hey , what happened?
you don't look very happy .
fools .
bureaucratic fools .
what'd they say?
they don't know what they've got there .
well , i know what i've got here .
come on .
i'll buy you a drink .
you know ... a drink?
