what was that , mr. jones?
what did we just pass on the road?
are you speaking to me?
yes , i am , mr. jones .
or is it jonesy?
that's what your friends call you , isn't it?
let's be friends .
why are you letting me live?
i'm borrowing you .
we're going to take a little journey .
beaver never hurt a soul and you killed him .
he had nothing in his head .
i've found something useful in yours .
fuck you !
i know what that expression means .
i've studied the foul language section of your memory warehouse .
rather distasteful , i must say .
how about this , mr. gray?
eat shit and die .
why did you call me mr. gray?
watch out for ister gay .
someone told you about me .
who told you about me?
if you want to know , why don't you read my mind?
surprisingly , you're able to keep things from me ... ... i don't understand it .
but i'm sure i'll figure it out soon .
oh , pete , jesus !
motherfucker tried to bite my dick off , jonesy .
i always thought it would be my ex wife did that .
let's get you to some help .
can you still see the line , buddy?
i don't need the line to get to gosselin's .
no , i know that , but ... ... if we didn't want to go to gosselin's , how would you get us out to 95?
95?
who gives a shit?
i'm hurting here , jonesy .
what's wrong with you?
wait a minute , you're not ...
shut up , pete .
you're too messed up to know what you're saying .
too late for that .
pete , i need you to get onto the snowmobile right now .
who the fuck are you?
you sound like one of those james bonds !
this has to do with the fucking eel , doesn't it?
you're not ...
stop it !
i'll get him to help .
pete , tell him what he wants to know .
now , pete , which way to l 95?
i need to go to massachusetts .
my , my .
that is a gift .
who taught you that?
you're gonna be a big help , pete .
climb aboard .
show's over out there , buddy .
let me in .
let me in .
what have you got in that part of your mind , professor?
your memories are out here in the warehouse , aren't they?
i want to know who warned you about me .
and who taught pete that nifty trick?
i'm sure the answers are here .
it'll just take me a while to find them .
to find them .
think about letting me in .
it's the polite thing to do .
polite thing to do .
beav !
what is this?
beav .

fuck me , freddy .
asshole !
so long , beav .

we all made them in art .
i finished first , so i made one for you , duds .

i duddits .
yes .
i duddits .
i duddits !

duds will find her .

he can do anything .
she's from the retard academy .
she always waves .
we've gotta save this girl .
save this world?
not the world , duds .
a girl .
we'll save the world some other time .
ister gay?
yeah , it's a mystery .
we need you to solve it .
dreamcatcher .
duds'll read our minds .
not this again .
shut up .
we gotta think of josie .
josie , josie , josie .
josie rinkenhauer .
josie?
that's right .
can you find josie?
this is completely crazy .
you can say that again .
i didn't say anything .
you did .
i heard you .
you said , " this is completely crazy .
i didn't say that .
i thought it .
kiss my bender .
duds can hear people's thoughts .
we can't .
are you sure of that , beav?
hey , guys !
she's down here for sure !
josie , you down there?
josie !

blue boy leader .
how we doing , bucko?
right here , boss .
fast and hard .
wouldn't have it any other way , blue boy .
sir?
i see it .
don't hurt us .
we're dying .
there is no infection here .
whose radio is that?
it's not the radio .
they're putting it into our heads .
we are helpless .
there it is , gentlemen .
there's no infection here .
directly into our heads .
this gives you an idea what we're up against .
if anybody's thinking , " those poor , helpless little folk ... ... all naked and unarmed beside their crashed intergalactic winnebago ... ... what kind of a dog , what kind of a monster ... ... could hear that heartbreak and go in just the same?
well , i'm that dog .
i'm that monster .
we are helpless .
we are dying .
these mothers are as harmless as a fox in a henhouse .
and i'm here to kick some ass !
are you with me?
yes , boss !
roger that , boss .
right on , boss .
don't hurt us .
i have a visual .
holy shit !
damn , look at the size of that .
blue boy group , this is blue boy leader .
target imminent .
move to level 4 readiness .
gentlemen , lock and load .
hellfires are hot .
sing it out , owen !
blue boy group , this is blue boy leader .
clean up the forest and get rid of this trash !
don't hurt us .
please , don't hurt us .
there is no infection here .
we are helpless .
fire at will !
fire !
owen , get them out of there !
it's gonna blow !
blue boy group , withdraw at once .
i repeat , cease firing and back off !
we can get them !
it's self destructing .
back off !
blue boy group , get out of there !
we're on top of it !
owen , pull out now !
pull out !
get out of there !
pull out !
jonesy , i've been thinking about our friend .
our scooby doo buddy .
for a long time i thought he was sent to us to warn us about something .
i could never figure what it was .
don't talk about him .
not till today .
it was this , right now .
he wanted to warn us .
go ahead , pete .
tell me about your friend .
did he show you that nifty trick?
no .
jonesy's right .
come on , pete .
let's talk .
bite my bag , motherfucker !
all right , pete , i'll bite .
your bag and everything else .
no , no !
you bastard !
no !
pete .
don't talk to him !
get out of there !
what's up?
thank god you came by , governor .
i'm broke down here and fearing for my life .
that's a good looking dog .
where you headed?
gosselin's .
any chance you're going near there?
that's where i'm going .
well , i believe your tailgate has come open .
let's take a look .
i see you have some cargo you're taking to blue base .
got a treat for you , ike .
all you can eat .
eat all the red stuff .
good doggy .
yes .
good boy .
have your fill .
tasty , tasty .
eat all you want ...
jonesy .
what are you up to?
jonesy !
oh , god !
halt or we'll fire !
you cannot leave the quarantine zone !
halt !
i think i just about halted here .
come with me , owen .
i'll show you things you'll wish you'd never seen .
how long we gotta be here?
it'll be all right .
i demand to see my lawyer !
there must be something they can do .
don't worry , you'll be fine .
when do we get out?
within hours .
you can't do this to people in america !
i told you to stay over there !
my wife ...
government's doing everything they can ... ... to get you out of here .
please don't worry .
it's all right .
we're doing everything to make sure you're safe .
we'll get you back to your homes within hours .
all clear .
can i help you , sir?
what's your name?
henry .
dr. henry devlin .
a doctor?
good .
we need doctors in there .
come on , laddie , i'll buy you a cup .
you , sir , where you from?
boston .
beantown?
great city .
we'll have you back there in no time .
maybe by morning .
hurry up , bucko .
you see that crud on the faces of children ... ... you know why i relish a turn in the country like we had today .
you were excellent out there , o.
it made me feel very proud to ...
abe?
abe , you okay?
abe?
yeah , i'm fine .
i'm fine .
i must be getting too old for this shit .
i don't know what the hell that was about .
it's the only way , owen .
we've got to cauterize the site .
they've all got to die .
it's the only way .
but we don't know that .
the studies point to the strong possibility of recovery for many exposed subjects .
the studies show squat , that's what they show .
if matheson had been in my spot for the last quarter century ... ... you'd have never made it to your first jerk off .
those gray bastards would have had you for lunch back in armpit , kentucky .
some get better .
at least half will be over it in a few days ... which ones , mother teresa?
can you guarantee they won't take it home like a present for the family?
i'll tell you what you should be worried about .
what should be on your mind .
not these few unfortunates .
what you should be worried about is a hitchhiker .
what?
a hitchhiker .
our greatest fear is that a grayboy would catch a ride ... ... with somebody and would carry them out of here , without being consumed .
to scatter the infection , like johnny fucking appleseed .
are you sure there isn't such a person?
no .
but i am sure that if there is one he won't get out .
not with the net my boys put up around the blue zone .
and if we do a thorough job on the ones we've got .
if we don't get gooey about the little picture when our job is taking care of the big one .
capisce?
owen , if you think this is easy for me , you're crazier than my mother was .
those poor schmucks .
they drive chevrolets , shop at wal mart ... ... never miss an episode of friends .
these are americans .
the idea of slaughtering americans ... ... it just turns my stomach .
but i'll do it .
i'll do it because it needs to be done .
so if we start at 2 , we can be done by 2 : 30 .
and it's all behind us .
except for the dreams .
yeah , except for them .
what are you gonna tell rita about what you did here?
what are you gonna tell katrina when she's old enough to ask?
you know me , don't you?
i don't remember when we met , but you know me .
we don't have time to screw around .
you've got two problems .
one you know about , one you don't .
go ahead .
your mentor , colonel curtis , he's gone insane from hunting aliens for 25 years .
now he wants you to help him kill hundreds of innocent people .
who are you?
me?
talk about that later , once we get out of here .
you're predictable .
you won't let me burn on this fence ... ... any more than you'll help curtis kill those people .
what you're thinking now is whether that digital sat scan transmitter ... ... in your duffle bag will let you get through to somebody .
somebody named general matheson .
sometimes we have to kill , but our real job is to save lives .
your father was a great soldier .
those were his last words .
you carry his picture with you always .
tell me everything .
you'll save these people .
when we're done talking , get on the transmitter , contact matheson .
cavalry rides in .
that takes care of problem number one .
now comes the hard part .
you think the infection's been contained , that there's no hitchhiker .
you're wrong .
he's riding with my best friend on earth .
a guy named gary jones .
and he's out there .
you and i don't get after him right away , he'll get out of my range ... ... and some kind of shit is gonna hit the planetary fan .
our nightmare hitchhiker .
and all dr. mystery wants is a free pass so he can catch his friend .
very convenient .
i'm saying you ought to hear his story .
okay .
where is he?
had him taken to the tractor shed .
okay .
i'll check him out and we can compare notes .
whatever you say , boss .
come on , come on .
time's a wasting .
all right , lad , open up .
dr. boston?
are you in here?
i'm here .
where i've been put .
a prisoner on my own damn property .
let's go !
come on , let's go .
get in !
you almost ran me down .
figured you'd read my mind and get out of the way .
blue unit , stand down .
you are under regular army command .
put down your weapons at once .
your mission is rescinded .
this is no longer a blue unit operation .
put down your arms .
repeat , put down your arms .
general matheson has assumed command .
okay , owen .
okay .
you just drove over the curtis line .
where we going?
south .
all i know right now .
just get me in range of jonesy ... ... we'll know everything we need to know .
that's some gun .
can i have a look?
kind of flashy for a guy like you , isn't it?
it's a gift .
i know .
where are you , jonesy?
pick up the phone .
call 1 800 henry .
hello?
jonesy !
jesus christ , i knew it was you .
where's he taking you?
massachusetts?
he is?
duddits?
okay , i will .
you hang in there , jonesy .
jonesy?
he hung up .
give me back my gun .
we gotta go to derry .
that where they're going?
no , they're going towards massachusetts .
we need duddits .
jonesy says mr. gray is afraid of duddits .
your buddy , he's still alive after all this time with mr. gray?
yeah , he's immune .
i think it's because he died .
he got hit by a car and his heart stopped .
twice .
i don't think he even knows it .
he came back from the dead .
must have changed him somehow .
it's almost like duddits saw this whole thing coming .
is that it?
jonesy told me it was duddits who drew him into the accident .
if we catch him , we're gonna have to kill him .
you know we have to do it .
it's the only way to stop mr. gray ... ... assuming we can catch him .
when was the last time you saw duddits?
long time ago .
years .
what makes you so sure he can help?
duddits can do anything .
i didn't understand that then , but i think it's always been true .
he's the one who made us like this .
like what?
you know , weird .
he's been waiting for you .
blizzard slowed us up .
henny , henny .
henny .
i miss you , henny .
i miss you .
henny .
long time , henny .
my god , roberta , what is it?
lymphocytic leukemia .
i'm gonna let you take him , but i have to tell you why .
just now , when he was getting ready ... ... henry he was so excited .
like he hasn't been in such a long time .
i think ... ... that if he's with you , he might die happy ... ... instead of in this awful room .
be sure the parka stays on tight .
cold devastates him .
the medication and instructions are in here .
bye , mom .
goodbye , duddie .
be a good boy .
now , go save the world .
i'm all right , laddie .
they haven't got enough courage to take my trailer .
not yet , anyway .
what've we got?
they're leaving derry , maine , heading south on 95 .
toward massachusetts .
massachusetts?
stay with it , bucko .
general matheson .
come in , please .
this is very nice , abe .
been home through some rough times .
was there something we hadn't covered?
i don't think i got to say before how much i respect the work you've done .
it was with sincere regret ...
herman ...
may i call you herman?
i'm past it .
burned out .
just needed a push , that's all .
should have quit after that mess in montana .
even i don't trust my judgment anymore .
oh , yeah ...
my techies tell me we're getting some electronics reading hot from in here .
yes , i've been talking to the wife on my sat phone .
i don't know if you've ever met barbara .
she's been after me for years to retire .
she's very happy , i can tell you that .
i'll have everything shut down in an hour .
if that's soon enough .
that will be fine .
how do you turn off the goddamn lights?
maybe you shouldn't have been so fast to kill that trooper .
you're making yourself at home .
you have no idea , jonesy .
maybe you shouldn't have been so fast to kill that trooper . " not bad?
oh , don't like that , gary , do you?
ownzy .
he's in a police car now .
he's in a police car now .
can you see where they are , duds?
ownzy .
he's in ister gay .
mr. gray .
that's right , duds , he is in mr. gray .
ister gay " is mr. gray .
we gotta save this girl .
save the world?
not the world , duds , a girl .
we'll save the world some other time .
ister gay?
you already knew .
where's he going , duds?
where is mr. gray taking jonesy?
ister gay , he want war .
war?
not war , water .
mr. gray wants water .
i know where he's going .
he's going to the quabbin reservoir .
what's quabbin?
it supplies drinking water for all of boston .
what?
one worm kills the world .
one worm kills the world?
oh , my god .
one worm .
back at our cabin , i saw the worms that come out of these weasels .
mr. gray must want to get one into the boston drinking supply .
just one worm infects the whole world?
are we going right?
yes .
take the 495 to the mass pike .
it's not far .
you're doing great , buddy .
now , are you ready to try something hard?
i want to ask you something hard .
yes , henny .
good .
can you talk to jonesy?
can you make him hear you?
ownzy ... ... and ister gay .
duddits .
i knew it .
i knew it .
he's been here all along .
waiting .
jonesy?
it appears we didn't meet by accident .
we owe it to our friend , duddits .
i don't know what you mean .
no?
maybe not .
maybe your clever friend didn't want you to know what he was up to .
that's why you had nothing in the warehouse about me .
duddits didn't bother to tell you what job he had in mind for you .
it doesn't matter .
his little scheme didn't work .
did it , ike?
no , no .
we're almost there .
what was it your poetry file had to say?
i have promises to keep and miles to go before i sleep
and miles to go before i sleep
stop that chopper !
punch it , dude .
don't be a pussy .
thank you , gary jones .
go up around the reservoir .
aqueduct to boston starts in shaft 12 .
patience , bambino .
just up ahead .
stay here and take care of your friend .
no matter what you hear .
so long , doctor .
good doggy .
good girl .
shit !
you son of a bitch !
wait .
wait .
go back to car , duddie .
you'll be safer there .
look out , jonesy .
i knew you'd come , henry .
i knew you wouldn't let me die .
who the fuck are you?
don't you know me , h?
i don't know .
i think i'm gonna have to shoot you .
just to be sure .
well , maybe you're right , my friend .
i don't know myself if mr. gray is gone .
he could be hiding in here somewhere ... ... waiting for his chance .
tell me something mr. gray couldn't possibly know .
tell me something only we would know .
ssdd .
not good enough .
well , you decide .
ask me anything .
at tracker brothers , day we met duddits ... ... what was painted on the wall by the window?
no ...
... bounce ...
no play .
hello ... ... ister gay .
you .
ooby ooby doo ... ... we got some work to do now .
ister gay ... ... go away .
no !
i duddits .
h?
jonesy .
jonesy , if that really is your name ...
that'll be 50 small .
bullshit .
i duddits .
i duddits .
they're my friends .
we're all best friends .
here's to duddits , our dreamcatcher .
