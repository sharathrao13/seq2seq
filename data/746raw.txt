you left it wide open .
and leaving the door open is the worst mistake any employee can make because ...?
um ... it could let in a draft?
it could let in a child !
oh !
mr waternoose !
there is nothing more toxic or deadly than a human child .
a single touch could kill you !
leave a door open and a child could walk right into this factory !
right into the monster world !
i won't go in a kid's room !
you can't make me !
you're going in there because we need this .
our city is counting on you to collect those children's screams .
without scream , we have no power .
yes , it's dangerous work and that's why i need you to be at your best .
i need scarers who are confident , tenacious tough , intimidating .
i need scarers like ... like ...

your hair was shorter then .
mm hmm .
i'm thinking about getting it cut .

you know what i said?

ready for decontamination .
well , i don't think that date could have gone any worse .
if witnesses are to be believed there has been a child security breach for the first time in monster history .
we can neither confirm nor deny the presence of a human child here tonight .
well , a kid flew right over me and blasted a car with its laser vision !
i tried to run from it , but it picked me up with its mind powers and shook me like a doll !
it's true !
i saw the whole thing !
it is my professional opinion that now is the time to ... panic !
oh oh .
oh , it's coming !
it's coming !
boo !
no , no , no , no , no !
come here , kid .
whee .
no , don't touch those , you little ... !

'cause they're gonna find us
so please stop crying
right now .
good , good , sulley .
keep it up .
you're doing great .
ooh , the happy bear , he has no ...
she touched me !
sulley , the bear !
the bear !
give her the ...
whoa !
what was that?
i have no idea but it would be really great if it didn't do it again .
shh , shh , shh .
shh ...
shh .
shh ...
ah !
how could i do this?
how could i be so stupid?
this could destroy the company .
the company?
who cares about the company? !
what about us?
that thing is a killing machine !
la la la la la la
i bet it's just waiting for us to fall asleep and then wham !
oh , we're easy prey , my friend easy prey .
we're sitting targets .
okay , look , i think
i have a plan here .
using mainly spoons , we dig a tunnel under the city and release it into the wild .
spoons .
that's it , i'm out of ideas .
we're closed .
hot air balloon?
too expensive .
giant slingshot?
too conspicuous .
enormous wooden horse?
too greek !
no plan .
no plan .
can't think .
can't think .
flatlining .
uh , mike?
i think she's getting tired .
well , then why don't you find someplace for it to sleep?
while i think of a plan !
are you sleepy?
you want to sleep?
is that what you want?
huh?
okay , all right .
i'm making a nice little area for you to ...
no .
hey , hey , that's my bed !
you're going to get your germs all over it .
fine .
my chair is more comfortable anyway .
what?
it's just a closet .
will you go to sleep?
hey , that looks like randall .
randall's your monster .
you think he's going to come through the closet and scare you .
oh , boy , how do i explain this?
uh , it's empty .
see?
ah !
no monster in here .
well , now there is but i'm not going to scare you .
i'm off duty .
okay .
how about i sit here , until you fall asleep?
go ahead .
go to sleep .
now .
now ... go .
uh , you ... go ... to ... sleep .
hey , mike , this might sound crazy but i don't think that kid's dangerous .
really?
well , in that case , let's keep it .
i always wanted a pet that could kill me !
now , look .
what if we just put her back in her door?
what?
mike , think about it .
if we send her back , it's like it never happened .
everything goes back to normal .
is that a joke?
tell me you're joking .
sulley , i'd like to think that , given the circumstances
i have been extremely forgiving up to now but that is a horrible idea !
what are we going to do?
march right out into public with that thing?
then i guess we just waltz right up to the factory , right?
i can't believe we are waltzing right up to the factory .
sulley , a mop , a couple of lights and some chair fabric are not going to fool anyone !
just think about a few names , will you?
loch ness , bigfoot , the abominable snowman they all got one thing in common , pal banishment .
we could be next !
don't panic we can do this .
hey , how you doing , frank?
hey , guys .
everything's going to be okay .
number one wants this place dusted for prints .
careful with that .
i got a good view from here .
a little lower .
this was recovered at the scene .
don't panic .
don't panic !
don't tell me not to panic .
just keep it together .
everything is not okay !
boo . ... could be contaminated .
gentlemen , safety is our number one concern .
if there's anything that ...
not now , not now .
oh , hello , little one .
where did you come from?
mr waternoose !
ah , james !
is this one yours?
actually , that's my , uh , cousin's sister's daughter , sir .
yeah , it's , uh ...
bring an obscure relative to work day .
hmm , must have missed the memo .
well , listen , james why don't you stop by the simulator after lunch today and give us that scare demonstration we talked about , huh?
oh , oh , sir , uh ....
excuse me , mr waternoose?
yes , yes , i'm coming .
all right then , i'll see you this afternoon , james .
that is , if these gentlemen haven't shut us down .
oh , boy .
oh , a scare demo .
well , that is great .
why am i the last to know?
we can bring your cousin's sister's daughter along .
she'll be a big hit !
halt !
stop him !
hold him down .
come on , the coast is clear .
okay , all we have to do is get rid of that thing .
so , wait here while i get its card key .
but she can't stay here .
this is the men's room .
that is the weirdest thing you have ever said .
it's fine .
it's okay .
look , it loves it here !
it's dancing with joy !
uh , uh , uh , uh .
i'll be right back with its door key .
that's a cute little dance you've got .
it almost looks like you've got to ...
oh .
uh , are you done in there?
ah !
sorry .
sorry .
okay , you finished now , right?
hello?
boo .
where did she go?
oh , did she disappear?

i just have no idea .
gotcha !

roz , my tender , oozing blossom you're looking fabulous today .

randall was working late last night out on the scare floor .
i really need the key for the door he was using .

they're rehearsing a play .
she's out of our hair !
can it , wazowski !

word on the street is the kid's been traced back to this factory .
you haven't seen anything , have you?
uh , well , uh ...

it'll be empty , you idiot !
you see that clock?
when the big hand is pointing up and the little hand is pointing up the kid's door will be in my station .

this whole thing is randall's fault .
randall?
yes .
and we can take you to his secret lab , which is right here in this factory .
how could this happen?
oh , how could this happen?
does anyone else know about this?
no , sir .
good .
this company can't afford any more bad publicity .
now , before we do anything else , let's ... take care of the child .
oh , i never thought things would come to this ... not in my factory .
i'm sorry you boys got mixed up in this .
especially you , james .
but now we can set everything straight again for the good of the company .
uh ... sir , that's not her door .
i know , i know .
it's yours .

it's too late !
we're banished , genius .
we're in the human world !
oh , what a great idea , going to your old pal waternoose !
too bad he was in on the whole thing !
all you had to do was listen to me just once !
but you didn't , did you?
you're still not listening !
take that !
welcome to the himalayas !

looked at me?
ah , poor guy .
i understand .
it ain't easy being banished .
take my buddy , bigfoot .
when he was banished he fashioned an enormous diaper out of poison ivy .
wore it on his head like a tiara .
called himself king itchy .
ah , it won't be so hard for you guys , though , you know .
i mean , how lucky can you get?
banished with your best friend .
he is not my friend .
oh .
i just assumed you were buddies , you know when i saw you out there in the snow hugging and all that .
look at that big jerk .
ruined my life , and for what?
a stupid kid !
because of you , i am now stuck in this frozen wasteland !
wasteland?
i think you mean wonderland !
i mean , how about all this fabulous snow , huh?
oh , and wait till you see the local village .
cutest thing in the world .
i haven't even mentioned all the free yak's milk .

yak's milk .
milking a yak ain't exactly a picnic .

something about a village .

we would have had it made !
none of that matters now .
none of it matter ...
wa wait a second .

sulley , what about everything we ever worked for?
does that matter?
huh?

i'm your best friend .
don't i matter?
i'm sorry , mike .
