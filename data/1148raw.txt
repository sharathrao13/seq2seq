sometimes , life is so perfect .
isn't it?
it has to be .
to make up for all the hard stuff it throws your way .
you have to learn to walk .
you have to learn to talk .
you have to wear that totally ridiculous hat your grandma bought you .
you have no say in the matter .
and when you're a little older , even though you get to choose your hats , you don't get to choose what they put in those meatballs at the cafeteria .
or when to fall in love .
things happen , and you just have to deal .
and breathe .
let's just think of the day my parent's divorce came through as " big , ugly hat day .
refer to diagram b on page 19 .
the tree of life .
and breathe . ... anybody but his own selfish pleasure .
mom , please .
focus .
i couldn't care less about your father's midlife crisis and complete mockery of his wedding vows .
i just hope he doesn't expect me to take ...
halley , i'm sorry .
i didn't see you there .
guys ...
where do you think you're going?
as long as you're gonna kill me with flying ice , does it matter?
excuse me , everyone .
l ...
mom?
sorry .
i have some really important news to announce here .
lewis and i ... we're getting married .
he asked me last saturday night .
i wanted to tell you , but i wasn't sure when , or how you'd react .
i told him i couldn't even wear this ring until after i talked to you .
but we wanna have this big spring wedding .
mom , i'm so happy .
nice timing , huh?
tell your mom you're getting married on the day she gets divorced .
why does love make people crazy?
scarlett , you weren't picking up your phone .
i'm so sorry .
halley , that's michael .
michael ...
hi .
thank you .
bye !
i love you !
what do you think?
you didn't tell me you were doing it .
when you meet the right person and you fall in love ...
it's like ... it's like everything you thought ... you thought is ...
can you believe it?
no .
i can't .
scarlett , come on .
you are sounding dangerously close to a hallmark greeting card .
you're gonna let yourself turn into mush over something like sex?
yeah .
you can't expect to do anything great in life if you buckle the first time some guy bats his eyes at you .
news flash , hal .
even madonna eventually got married .
my mom thinks that means there's hope for her , too .
your mom wants to get married?
well , she wants to fall in love , halley .
everyone does .
hi .
i've been in ...
hi .
i've been divorced for a long time , so my baggage is ancient history .
i like to think that i travel light these days .
except for my daughter , scarlett , who is just a joy of a carryon .
i think i'm taking the baggage thing too far .
maybe i should start over .
you know what i think of this whole idea .
i'm only gonna send it to the online guys who pass my rigid five point checklist .
here , you try .
go away .
lydia .
the man of your dreams is sitting out there right now waiting to hear from you .
speak to him .
i don't think the perfect man is gonna want to hear what i have to say .
sure he does , sweetie .
speak to him .
go on .
i'm sorry , mr. perfect ... but if you're waiting for me , it's gonna be a hell of a long wait .
see , i've had it with men like you .
i think it's terrific that you have a great job , and you're sensitive to the needs of others , and you jog three times a week to keep the belly at bay .
but the second some silicon breasted , butt kissing , airhead climber half your age comes along , you can't keep your pants zipped .
well , fuck you !
that's right , mr. middle age , think you're a big shot , phony asshole .
you ain't gettin 'any from me .
okay .
i think we'll just give this a little time .
so juvenile .
i'm glad you're back early from camp , even though it was a dishonorable discharge .
what happened?
where were you trying to get to in that canoe?
no comment .
no comment?
i don't speak to the press .
i'm the press?
yeah , and anything i say can and will be used against me , right?
i would never use anything against you .
dad , give it up !
it's old , and you need to get your own material .
daddy dog .
yo .
len martin .
it's you , right?
wdyg's coolest dj .
that's me .
we dig the dog !
love your show , man .
thanks , man .
you are the hippest old guy i know .
yo , dude !
i'm not that old !
that's len martin .
hello , gorgeous ones .
and you invited her .
hey , baby .
hey .
i thought we'd spend time together , then we could have a chance to bond .
well ...
iook at you , halley .
that's hard to do without a mirror , isn't it?
honey , you keep getting prettier every day .
i have no idea how you could say that , cause ... you definitely don't see me every day , do you?
and yesterday , oh , my god , i was so ugly , and last wednesday ... that sucked , too .
so it's kind of a day to day thing .
i love that sense of humor .
just like her daddy .
look at that gorgeous girl .
dad , stop it .
she's got her daddy's hair .
don't cut it .
it's beautiful .
don't cut it .
just let it grow , let it grow .
don't cut it .
cut it .
okay .
let me count the ways that this card can be used to induce ... nausea , gastric distress , vomiting .
yeah , go ahead and mock me , but this is serious .
i need to find something funny and something sweet ... just the way scarlett is .
remember last time i got her ...
okay .
look , here's one .
not helping .
from small beginnings come great things .
congratulations on your new baby .
i thought you were gonna help .
lighten up , sherwood .
the first time we met , you stole my heart .
good luck in finding a compatible organ donor . " nice .
i'm kidding , okay?
it's blank inside .
you know something?
you're not too funny .
this girl is amazing ... unlike you ... and she's sensitive ... unlike you .
and she's sexy .
unlike you .
there's gotta be a card ...
is that michael? ... for a redhead from ...
i can't see . ... a newly smitten hunka hunka burning love .
i mean ...
iook .
summer romance has its own section .
it's not a summer romance .
i mean ...
scarlett is ...
standing right behind you , dude .
hi .
sneaking up on me?
hi , halley .
hi .
you remember my name?
sure .
we were in biology together .
yeah , i know , but ... well , you were never there , really ... technically .
i like your hair .
thank you .
see , my schedule is all wrong , which i think is a sign that nothing's going according to plan this year .
it's a complete and total mess .
looks like a fine schedule to me .
no .
band?
i would never sign up for band .
what's wrong with band?
i don't play anything .
well , maybe you should .
i'm sure you can handle it .
mrs. toussaint , this is not my schedule .
look , i'm signed up for algebra , and i've already taken calculus .
maybe a brush up is a good thing , not to mention a good grade .
why don't you just give it a shot before you decide anything?
okay , i'm signed up for boys 'p. e.
94 fm fill out this form .
daddy dog .
we'll start again .
len martin with a traffic update from that love puppy in the skies , our very own lorna queen .
lorna , you up there?
hi , len .
on a clear day , you can see forever , and this is one beautiful morning .
should we tell everyone our little secret?
careful .
baby , you sure this is the time?
i am bursting at the seams to tell everyone we're eloping .
i just spilled the beans .
that is your father's show , right?
i just love it .
hi .
tell him congratulations .
i'm sure you're very excited about the upcoming nuptials .
my father and my sister .
my sister and my father?
your father and your sister are getting married?
yeah .
no , not to each other .
i ...
i have to check something before i fill this out .
sit down , forrester .
let's see if we can sort out your usual chaos .
maybe you'll even do us the honor of attending this year .
okay , later , m. t. i gotta rethink that shop class .
i'm pretty scary with tools .
oh , my .
you didn't know about your dad getting married?
yes , i did .
the bastard tells the whole world before he tells you .
he's not ...
whatever .
at least if they're eloping , you won't have to go the wedding .
weddings are the worst .
me?
i've had to go to , like , five between my parents .
don't ask .
listen , m. t. wasn't giving you a hard time back there , was she?
m. t. "?
mrs. toussaint and i ... we're on close terms .
you get to know your guidance counselor really well when you're clearly in desperate need of guidance .
see , i've got it down to a science .
you try the jedi mind trick .
what's that?
you never saw star wars?
no , i saw it .
i guess i just didn't memorize it like you did .
well , that's your loss , isn't it?
because the jedi mind trick is when you tell someone what to think , and they think it .
for example , m. t. says ,
macon , you're already in trouble , and it's the first day of school .
is this any way to start the new year?
pretend you're me .
now what do you say?
okay .
i say ...
no .
i wanna be someone else .
cute .
no .
you as me say ...
mrs. t , you're gonna let this one slide because it was an honest mistake , it's only the first day of school , and the fire was put out as quickly as it was started .
you didn't really start a fire , did you?
the point is that you put the words into somebody's mouth and they give them back like they've come up with the idea .
like when i ask you to go out this friday night , you're gonna think you're asking me because you're gonna say ,
i would love to go out with you
because i know we'll have a great time together .
in fact , i've been hoping you'd ask me all week .
you wanna go out on a date with me?
see?
i told you you'd ask me .
macon , i think i like you too much already to actually go out with you .
what kind of logic is that?
it's logical logic .
the quickest way to ruin a relationship with someone is to actually try to have a relationship with them .
haven't you noticed when the opposite sex gets together , eventually someone ends up getting hurt?
i am , too ... boycotting .
you can't boycott your father's wedding .
it's not even a wedding .
it's ... an elopement .
yeah , except everyone within his radio frequency is invited .
my god .
he is such a hypocrite .
i cannot believe he wouldn't tell us about it first .
he didn't give any warning when you went dinner?
none .
she was at that dinner?
no .
okay , yeah .
she was there at the end .
mom , come on .
she wasn't even supposed to be there .
you know , i don't think i'm gonna let him walk me down the aisle .
please stop worrying about me .
i am fine .
i'm fine .
in a way , it sets me free .
i feel strangely liberated .
and he is still your father , after all , and if he wants to make a complete and utter fool of himself by trying in some pathetically clich fashion to recapture his sorry state of manhood , by hooking up with not even a very attractive bimbo ... then if that's what he wants , i'm fine with that .
someone toss , please .
now .
this is our reception area .
with out post ceremony champagne bar ... which is conveniently located right next to our very own chapel .
can't you picture walking down this aisle?
in a coffin .
sorry , it's just ... a little depressing .
actually , nobody's ever said that before .
lewis ... say something .
what do you think?
well , i like it .
it's very clean .
clean?
is that what you want our wedding day to be?
clean?
it's not ... it's not pretty , it's not intimate , it's not romantic .
i'm just so happy that i get to marry you .
i'm sorry , not to pressure you , but this space does book up quickly for spring .
we have another couple ...
why don't we give them a moment to think .
ashley , sweetie , they plan the whole thing .
the food , the flowers ... even the place cards .
think about how much less hassle it'll be .
you think planning the most important day of our lives is a hassle?
it hasn't even been that long .
191/ 2 hours .
wouldn't michael look cool in that?
hey , i did a good job .
michael sherwood would look good in anything .
that's not the point , though , okay?
enjoy him , and fool around with him .
don't fall in love with him .
why do you think they call it " falling , " anyways?
it's not worth it to you to spend on a wedding .
it's the most important day .
i was trying to kill two birds with one stone .
cheap is what that is .
you see cheap , i see convenience .
look at them .
they're like a walking warning sign against romance .
lewis is this anal , uptight geek who has my sister under some spell .
now all this formerly semi intelligent person thinks about is diamonds and hairdos and bullshit .
it's like k mart .
how am i supposed to know what it looks like?
maybe go by and look at it?
or maybe ...
see?
they don't even like each other .
but this stupid spell they're under makes them disregard all the facts .
they are fighting because they love each other enough to care .
i didn't know it looked like a k mart before i went there .
once we got in there , you knew .
i made a mistake .
too bad you can't get a divorce before getting married .
you could save yourself in that stupid extra step .
i'm sorry .
see?
what are you looking for?
these dishes , they're perfect .
that's love , halley .
okay , fall once and you may never be able to get back up again .
geek !
get out of here .
isn't he adorable?
he's cute .
all right , michael !
way to get that goal !
okay , guys , line up !
okay , back up .
let's give him some air .
sherwood?
you hear me?
guys , back up .
give him some air , all right?
call the doctor .
i thought my parents 'divorce was the end of the world .
that was before michael died of a heart defect .
and the world stopped .
or it should have .
i'm sorry .
what do you think?
i think it's 100 degrees out .
what am i supposed to do?
the only black clothes i have are winter clothes .
i have nothing nice to wear .
i don't think it matters , really .
look , this is ... this is dark green and it's really nice .
it's ugly , halley .
i'm just trying to think about something else .
anything , for one single second .
i wanna look good for him .
does that sound crazy?
this was a bad idea .
yeah , but dying is definitely not one of the better concepts .
no , the dress .
everyone's looking at me like i'm a freak .
okay , it's not for them .
it's for michael .
remember that .
can you believe what she's wearing?
that's , like , so disrespectful .
she always has to have all the attention to herself .
although it droop and die that night , it was the plant and flower of light .
in small proportions , we just beauty see .
and in short measures ,
life may perfect be .
mr. macon forrester will now address us .
i was gonna read from this ...
but i'm not very good at reading .
or writing ... or spelling .
not like michael .
he was good at so many things without even trying .
he taught me how to be myself .
by myself .
not to worry about what other people think .
even if that means being completely uncool .
he taught me about how to trust people .
and how to love .
'cause he was so good .
he loved his family , he loved his friends .
he loved basketball .
and he loved scarlett .
and he loved this .
take this woman , lorna queen , to be your lawful wedded wife , your partner , the queen of your heart , forever and ever?
oh , yeah !
daddy , rock on with your woman !
and do you , lorna p. queen , take this old guy len to be your lawfully wedded husband for all the rest of your days?
i do .
wrap it up .
we're off in 15 seconds .
go .
our airtime is almost up .
we must now go where federal regulations will not allow you to follow , if you know what i mean .
lewis , no barking .
sorry , but you gotta go .
poor little thing .
i know just how it feels .
out with the old , in with the new .
and who do you think you are?
just because you've got great petals .
oh , my god .
i'm talking to my plants .
oh , my god .
you're talking to your plants .
how was it?
it was great ... if you happen to be the devil and enjoy human pain .
tell me something .
i don't know !
what do you want me to tell you?
wait !
no , the bimbo almost died of strangulation .
i cannot believe i forgot to tell you .
her wedding veil took on a life of its own and rebelled , and she had to claw her way out .
and you know that woman can claw .
it was so sad .
it was like ... near death by wedding veil .
just tragic , isn't it?
oh , my god !
and their vows?
was dad that much a loser when you guys got married?
i'm sorry .
your father's not a loser .
although he did choose to look like one at our wedding , too .
he insisted on wearing a powder blue tuxedo .
then why do people get married , anyways?
we know they're lying to each other , but are they lying to themselves , too?
how can you promise you're gonna feel the same way forever?
things do sometimes change , halley .
this house is awfully big for just the two of us , don't you think?
what?
you'll be going to college soon .
mom ... a year and 3/ 4 is not really that soon .
i want to start thinking about streamlining .
maybe we should sell the house .
i grew up in this house .
yes , and there have been some great memories in this house .
this is my house .
i understand how you must feel , but life changes .
this is ridiculous , mom !
come on !
and i don't want to live here alone .
i have to give him a ride .
bye , halley .
stand back !
leaf man to the rescue .
where did you get that?
a guy's gotta pay for gas and bacon burgers somehow , right?
and toys , 'cause i imagine
star wars figurines must get pretty expensive .
i do not have any star wars figurines .
not many , and i don't play with them ... much .
this one's on the house .
okay .
here you go .
you're afraid to go out with me because you might like me?
no , but that's a good theory , i guess , if you want to protect your fragile male ego .
'cause you can't handle rejection .
rejection?
whatever !
of course you think it's weird that i didn't just use the phone , but you're also glad because it's much better to talk in person .
especially when i've come with such a specific purpose .
which is why you're gonna cut me some slack .
you are absolutely crazy .
i've been called worse .
you're gonna kiss me , halley .
you're gonna come a little closer ...
so i can put my arms around you .
and on the count of three ... two ... one .
you're a really good kisser .
you tricked me .
you jedi mind tricked me .
halley , is that you out there?
close your eyes .
go to bed .
give me a break .
who are you talking to?
i'm sorry , i ...
sorry .
i just ...
i needed to talk .
i was just coming over for a little late night chat .
we're not gonna stay up very late , okay?
at least do it inside .
nausea "?
a little .
breast tenderness "?
yeah .
major .
food cravings "?
grapefruit .
come on , i could answer " yes " to most of these questions , too .
i used to hate grapefruit .
what's wrong?
no offense , halley , but ... ... your perfume is making me sick .
come on , i'm not wearing perfume .
i use soap .
heightened sense of smell .
okay , so do you prefer direct pee on a strip or dip in a cup?
maybe it's a false reading .
because i have heard of things such as false readings .
and the strips did not look completely pink , only kind of pinkish , so ...
five kits , halley .
what am i gonna do?
so you take the car without my permission in the middle of the night on some kind of joy ride .
it wasn't a joy ride .
maybe i should ...
don't think you're off the hook .
you don't even have your license , and you are a terrible driver .
i was helping scarlett get some books at school ... we left them ...
forget it , halley !
mom ... taking your car out is gonna seem like the least of it ... because whatever you're thinking right now ... it's worse .
one of you better tell me before i have a nervous breakdown .
i'm pregnant .
well , thank god you told me in time .
shouldn't i be getting paid to wear a dress this ugly?
i'm sorry if you hate my taste and you think it's so awful you have to be in my wedding , but you are my sister .
it's an emotional time .
all right .
i was just joking .
just because you think up something you think is funny , doesn't mean you say it .
okay , ashley , i'm sorry , all right?
it's just ...
i love the dress , really .
i feel like a princess .
you know?
i look awful .
we'll fix it .
it's not the dress that needs fixing .
it's me .
ashley , would you drive halley home?
i have to get back to work .
give me my money back , you stupid , lying , feckless , two timing son of a bitch !
can i help you , ma'am?
it stole my money , so , just ...
here .
this works a little better sometimes .
what's your pleasure?
diet coke sounds good .
the last one .
on me .
i hope i didn't , you know , kick it too ...
i think these machines are built to withstand a good booting every now and then .
steve beckwith .
lydia martin .
did i say " martin "?
it's lydia williams now .
lydia williams again .
williams , again?
nice to meet you .
thank you .
aren't you gonna wear lipstick?
you sound like mom .
can one of you zip me , please?
you guys know you're wearing the same dress , right?
unbelievable .
you're grandmother's in there changing .
we practically are .
i'll change .
no , i'll change .
i can change .
no , i shouldn't wear black , anyway .
halley , could you please wear something a little more feminine?
because the warshers are really traditional .
thank you .
sweetheart , do you need the loo?
grandma , no .
i'm gonna use the one downstairs .
don't be silly .
come on in .
okay .
i'm almost through .
it smells like ...
just burning a little incense .
mother?
are you smoking the cannabis again?
i had a little headache .
but i'm feeling really much better now .
i knew we'd be late .
we're fine .
his parents are promptness nuts .
i can't believe i'm late .
that's what happens when you make people change ten times .
these leaves would make a wonderful textile .
halley , look .
i'll bet if we make sheets of this pattern , we'd make a million dollars !
mother , please , not now .
she's high .
she's not high , she's medicated .
it's interesting ... when you make the " ow 'sound , your mouth does this funny thing in the corner .
you're not sick anymore .
you were only allowed to use weed when you were sick .
could you ring the bell?
i do get headaches a lot .
smile .
does anyone else hear wind chimes or is it just me?
this is a total disaster .
shit !
hello .
now , i know it's turkey day , but we thought squab would be most special .
they're absolutely adorable .
squab .
can i say i'm a vegetarian?
no .
it reminds me of a little yellow parakeet i had when i was a girl .
such a sweet , smart little bird .
they look wonderful .
thank you .
marcella's such a truly magnificent cook .
we are lucky to have found her .
i bet there's a story in that .
tell me , how lost were you before you were found?
because you look like a lady who doesn't get lost very often .
grandma .
she came with us 20 years ago , when we moved here from atlanta .
she really raised our lewis .
i didn't realize you were a working mother .
i wasn't .
she did go through a brokerage training program .
she was good .
killer instinct .
but she set her sights on me , instead .
i'd say i got the best deal at the firm .
he's all right .
he's no clark gable ... but then very few men are .
what was the name of that character?
ashley .
no , you're ashley .
the wedding plans are coming along beautifully .
well , you holler if you need any help at all , understand?
i want this to be a memorable affair .
carol does throw one heck of a luncheon .
that is my one regret about not having more children .
having girls must be such fun .
but we always felt that having an only child was a much better way to mold and shape character .
ashley was alone for her first six years .
i like to think she got the best of both worlds .
my best friend is an only child .
she's having a baby , which at our age is something that obviously wasn't planned .
and her mom is not really thrilled about the whole situation , but i really think she's kind of starting to get behind it now , so ...
which way to the bathroom?
down the hall and to your left .
isn't it a surprise ... our children choosing to get married so young?
i always thought lewis would take his time to find the right person .
well , it must be the example of you and dad .
i mean ... you make marriage seem so fun .
and ashley's a lot like you , mom .
she's a very determined woman .
open the door , halley .
young lady?
open the door .
are you all right?
lovely evening .
thank you .
thanks for sticking up for me .
what are you talking about?
your mom obviously doesn't want you to get married .
you made it sound like i'm some desperate woman somehow forcing you into the whole thing .
i did not .
ashley's a very determined woman .
i didn't say that .
i have witnesses !
mom , you were there .
you did say something along those lines .
well , that is not how i meant it .
lewis , you have a lovely family and that is what is important .
they weren't exactly lovely to you .
oh , you actually work for a living , you lower class , pathetic divorce?
ashley , enough .
i'm the one who got humped by a dog in there .
where are we?
you'll see when we get there .
it's too dark to see .
well , just hold on .
me and sherwood found this place a couple years ago .
we used to come here .
you like it?
yeah .
yeah , come on .
let's dance .
no .
yes .
come on , macon .
no .
please?
come on , macon .
no .
please .
you look great , but i just ...
michael's parents moved to florida .
you still have to tell them .
i know .
i just can't figure out what to say that makes any sense .
which makes sense , given that none of what's happened makes any sense .
you know , it's weird .
because if you were the one that was pregnant ...
i would understand you considering having an abortion or putting the baby up for adoption .
you can still put the baby up for adoption .
no .
i know all the arguments .
and i know what i'm giving up .
and i know that nothing is gonna be normal for me anymore .
but what is normal , anyway?
growing up with my mom sure wasn't .
losing michael wasn't .
i used to think that my family was the picture perfect example of normal .
us .
maybe being abnormal is what's normal ... right?
yeah , like you and macon .
it doesn't make sense ... you falling in love with a guy like him .
i'm not falling in love with him , i like kissing him .
we're just friends .
with benefits .
shut up .
bye , i'm leaving .
you've got it bad .
i hope this isn't a bad time .
i know this is awfully forward of me , but ...
i can't stop thinking about you .
you're out of uniform .
oh , that .
i forgot i was wearing that .
didn't i explain?
i'm a civil war reenactor ... a little hobby .
i like thinking about a time when honor and chivalry really meant something .
i know i've been slow to take action .
slows good .
would dinner tonight be too fast?
yes .
i mean , no .
i mean , i'd love to .
cheers .
friends?
friends .
steve , i had a lovely time .
good night .
i was just ...
you were just leaving .
exactly .
this is how you conduct yourself in your own home?
you said it ... my own home .
that implies i have a right to choose what i do .
halley marie martin , conduct unbecoming .
no !
you never told me you were serious about this boy .
i'm not serious .
that's what you do with people you're not serious about?
you know what?
maybe if you had a little bit more fun , you wouldn't be in the position you're in right now .
where is all this attitude coming from?
this is not like you .
like me?
you don't even know me .
maybe you're just not very good at knowing people .
how well do you know that strange boy?
mom , he's not strange , okay?
his name is macon .
and maybe if you paid attention to anyone ...
god forbid ... besides yourself and ashley and her stupid wedding , you would know that .
i'm trying .
halley , you used to talk to me .
yeah , and you were too busy hating dad to listen .
i'm sorry you've had to go through this .
i hate dad ... so much for doing this to us .
i hate him , i hate him .
and then i don't hate him , and i feel bad for hating him ...
sweetie , i don't want you to hate your father .
he's a decent man .
i don't want you to hate me either , but i am going to have to start laying down some rules around here .
here we go .
halley , you're grounded until next year .
no .
you promised me that i could go to the new year's eve party with macon ...
mom , please !
no .
no buts , no new year's eve , no macon .
god !
dear mr. and mrs. sherwood ...
guess what?
you're gonna be grandparents " ...
exclamation point .
why don't you try telling michael's parents what you really feel?
macon land .
happy new year .
happy new year .
hey , macon , the man .
hi .
the party's just arrived .
the party has ...
i'm here .
yeah .
okay .
hold still .
sorry .
now , you are pretty .
come on , you can smile better than that .
what?
she doesn't know how to smile?
maybe she doesn't want to .
well , excuse me for breathing .
yeah , you're breathing too close .
sorry about this .
it's okay .
happy new year .
happy new year .
here's to the new year , right?
yeah , right .
to the ... to the new year .
okay , knock knock .
police raid .
hey , macon , my man ... what's up?
what's up with you?
i lost my damn earring .
hey , macon .
hi , halley .
hi .
thanks .
nice name .
who wants to see my ferret?
dude , i have one .
come on , dude .
i put a little hat on him and everything .
it's awesome .
so , when's scarlett due , anyway?
you know?
yeah , my mom's a bookkeeper in her doctor's office , but ... don't worry .
i haven't told anyone .
third week of may .
god , that is so freaky .
you know , it's weird , but ...
i didn't even know they had hooked up .
really?
they went out all summer .
did they?
yeah , and he was completely in love with her .
she's ruining her life , you know .
i think i'd kill myself before i had a baby .
i know enough to know i wouldn't be able to handle it .
you're probably right , because you're not scarlett .
right .
thank god for that .
what's wrong?
i'm sorry .
halley , where are you going?
ten , nine , eight , seven , six , five , four , three , two , one .
i'm sorry .
i really am .
what was that all about?
i thought you wanted us to be together .
i do ... but , " together "?
it's so official and so big for us .
maybe you should just say what you feel for once .
i could do that .
i can .
i can .
i felt like i had to get out of there because i might ... really ... care about you , and ...
and it scared me so much because that meant that ... you could hurt me .
or maybe i just didn't feel ready .
to like someone ... that much .
and i like you .
don't make it so complicated , halley .
some people fall in love .
i had to crash into it .
hey , baby .
hi .
i'm sorry .
you gave us quite a scare .
god .
and i ruined your party , too .
i'm not concerned with the party .
your date with steve .
i know that was so important to you .
halley , i know you were with macon forrester .
mom , it was not his fault , though .
we were trying to leave this really bad party .
he was letting me drive ... you know i'm like the worst driver , and i could not even see ...
halley , save your strength .
you're gonna need it to come up with better excuses .
macon wasn't there when i woke up .
macon wasn't there when i left .
macon wasn't there the whole next week at school .
what do you expect when you break your own rules?
any word from him?
no .
i guess that's what guys are good at , right?
disappearing?
hey .
i'm back .
you really don't get it , do you?
i'm really not in the mood to wait for you to grow up .
oh , my ... are you okay?
hi , halley .
i think i just dropped my keys .
no , they're in the door .
come on .
stop spinning !
stop spinning .
i'm not spinning !
quiet !
maybe you should be quiet .
that's what you should do .
upstairs .
oh , halley , you're such a good sister .
you think i'm doing those?
i am not doing those .
be careful .
christ , halley .
it's all right .
this is my bachelorette party .
i am a bachelorette .
thank you , little sister .
you are the greatest .
okay , ashley , please just take this .
jesus .
what ...
you just ...
please .
come on .
mom is upstairs sleeping .
mom's not home .
really?
and how would you know that?
friday night she sneaks out to have sex with steve .
she told you that?
she didn't want you to know .
god , why do people think that i can't handle the truth?
go on , you hatchet faced scarecrow !
you baboon !
you bag of bones !
you old weasel face !
sourpuss !
sorry old flabby nincompoop !
top of the morning to you .
how is she?
sweetie .
a hangover kit .
not to appear superior , but i did limit myself to one glass of champagne , thank you very much .
if it wasn't for halley , i would've died , probably .
no , you just would've woken up on the porch .
bet the neighbors would've loved that .
right , especially with the men's underwear around her neck .
underwear?
it was nothing .
it was stupid .
underwear is not nothing .
no , they were pretty much nothing .
we promised each other no strippers .
i know , lewis , i know , but i was at the mercy of my friends .
don't promises we make to each other mean anything?
of course they mean something , lewis .
god , don't be so uptight !
oh , i'm uptight?
i'm not uptight !
yes , lewis , you are .
you are uptight .
you know what else?
halley was right about you .
you have got a broomstick up your butt .
i never said that !
okay , well , guess who put it there?
don't talk to me that way .
maybe i'll find somebody fun !
to tell the truth , you're no fun !
we made a promise to each other , but you don't keep it because you're self absorbed .
don't talk to me that way .
hello .
good morning , halley .
what's going on?
i think they're breaking up .
relax .
you're no fun .
marriage is a promise , and a promise has to be kept .
not every argument leads to a breakup .
for real !
the wedding is off .
i've been trying to say i'm sorry .
i'm sorry doesn't always cut it , macon !
i couldn't stay with you at the hospital .
i know i should have , but think how much more freaked out your mom would've got if she'd have seen me .
oh , my god .
okay .
wow , thank you so much .
so , you were ditching me for my own benefit .
no , that's not it .
i didn't ditch you .
l ...
okay , i ...
i freaked out .
i'm not used to feeling this way about somebody .
and i just ...
i couldn't believe i almost lost you , too .
here .
come on , i'll help you eat them .
no .
i don't want any .
i can't see you anymore .
your mom will get over it .
it's not my mom .
it's me .
and , of course , if you do decide to get married ,
i can get my makeup and hair people to do you on the big day .
if you decide not to get married ,
i think you should let them do some work on you anyway , because you are gonna want to look your best when you get back out there .
darling , there is nothing wrong with canceling a wedding .
no , it's indefinitely postponed .
that's what we're supposed to say officially .
my mom found out .
actually , i haven't really made up my mind yet , so if everybody could just ...
oh , honey .
give me a hug .
sweetie , you never know what's gonna happen .
okay?
for a while there , i thought i'd never get married .
finally , i had to put my foot down or my guy here would never have left ...
i'll get that .
hello?
honey , it's their mother calling from virginia .
it seems your grandmother had a bad fall .
your mother wants you to meet her there .
do you think she's okay in there?
it has been a while .
grandma , are you all right?
yes , i'm just smoking a little marijuana .
look at that pattern .
is it just me , or is that the spittin 'image of abraham lincoln?
look , halley , look .
there's the mole .
halley , you must see it !
you're the one who sees things no one else can see .
i do?
yes .
mother , you're not supposed to be walking yet .
next time you fall like that , you're going to break your hip , then die .
you remember when we went to see our comet together?
halley was too young to remember that .
no , i do remember .
you can't possibly .
you remember hearing about it .
no , mom , i do remember .
why does no one trust me to know what i know anymore?
god .
god !
she doesn't even think that my own memories belong to me .
darling , she's your mother .
now , tell me about this fella of yours .
who told you about that?
grandma , it's really over .
first loves are never really over .
nobody's perfect , sweetheart .
but that doesn't mean it wasn't worth your while .
oh , boy !
do i have the munchies !
what about him?
he's not terrible looking .
yeah , he's even cute in that geeky way that you like guys , ashley .
halley , it's ...
it's lewis .
ashley , love of my life ...
life of my heart ... once again ... will you marry me?
yes .
yes .
how crazy .
i can't believe it .
do it .
i owe you one .
for?
macon's a really great guy .
see ya , halley .
hey .
hi .
i had no idea that you guys were like ... hanging out .
elizabeth gunderson and me?
no , we're just ...
friends?
yeah .
right .
no , it's fine because we had our thing , and it was fun ... until it wasn't anymore , right?
no , that's not it .
when the going gets tough , it's best to just keep going , don't you think?
would you listen to me for a sec?
and to my bride .
thank you for showing me that socks don't need to be ironed ... that one needn't employ the dewey decimal system for their cd collection ... and that , in the end , it doesn't make a whole lot of difference whether you start the toilet paper facing up or down .
despite what my parents taught me .
because , ashley , you have shown me that life is worth embracing .
even if it means making a giant fool of yourself .
and lucky for me , you're willing to marry the guy who's been the biggest fool of all .
so here's to a lifetime of big , messy , wonderfully out of order moments with the most beautiful woman in the world ... my bride .
your big sister is getting married in 31/ 2 hours .
you know if you get nervous , you can always ...
you remember the sign .
of course .
you taught it to me , remember?
so , you know .
just ...
like that .
i'll do something .
i'll yell , " fire , " okay?
okay .
okay .
and we're back with the big dog of soft rock ,
wdyg , 94 fm .
we dig the dog .
this is daddy dog himself , len martin , coming to you today on a very special day ,
'cause one of my very own puppies ... the eldest ...
ashley , is getting married .
lorna , honey , any words of wisdom coming from you , my very own newlywed?
waterproof mascara .
i'm gonna borrow yours , 'cause daddy's gonna be weeping like a baby .
all right , let's kick off this power hour of love .
are you there?
security?
hey , give me ... come on .
this is my job !
my halley?
i don't know how to get you to listen , but maybe ...
let him talk .
just hear me out .
i suck with words .
but sometimes , words aren't the thing .
love isn't about words , it's about what you do .
and what i did ... running away , it was stupid .
we both know love's a big , scary , evil concept .
but if you feel it , it's gonna follow you around like a hungry dog no matter how far you run .
wait .
i didn't mean to say love's a dog .
i just mean , i'm not going anywhere .
i love you , halley .
if love beats us up , let's beat it up right back .
we could do this .
if you're ready to make the jump , i'll be right here to catch you .
and what a powerful power hour of love it has been .
this is len martin for wdyg , the big dog of soft rock .
that's right .
romance is in the air .
it's everywhere here today , folks .
this next song is going out to that young lady in question ...
miss halley martin and her big sister ashley ,
'cause daddy loves you .
you look beautiful .
you look beautiful , mom .
i'm not too old to wear pink?
no .
i look like a giant helium balloon .
come on .
we have to go .
i'm gonna walk over .
i'll meet you there .
let's get halley !
back seat .
i need to lie down .
please be seated .
we have come together today to join in holy matrimony
ashley renee martin and lewis gibson warsher il .
if any among you know any reason why this couple may not lawfully be married , declare it now or forever hold your peace .
do you , lewis , promise to love , honor , and cherish ashley from this day forward , for richer or for poorer , in sickness and in health , forsaking all others as long as you both shall live?
i do .
and do you , ashley , promise to love , honor , and cherish lewis for richer or for poorer , in sickness and in health , forsaking all others as long as you both shall live?
i do .
the rings?
dear friends , let us ask god to bless these rings as a symbol of their love everlasting .
no .
no , the other finger .
that's right .
ashley , lewis ...
she's having the baby .
it is now my delight ...
please be quiet . ... and honor to declare you husband and wife .
you may now kiss the bride .
she's having the baby .
now .

scarlett's having the baby .
i have to go .
i'm sorry .
i'm sorry .
scarlett's having the baby .
breathe .
wait , wait , wait !
no .
shit !
oh , for heaven's sake .
it's okay .
you're gonna have the baby !
thank you so much .
thanks .
you have got to do something .
that was just a dreadful scene .
now the seating arrangement's gonna be a disaster .
one empty seat throws everything off .
mother , stop it .
okay?
it doesn't get any better than this .
squeeze my hand .
it's okay .
we're gonna get there .
i assume daddy would like to be in the delivery room?
me?
no , no .
l ...
baby !
mommy !
hi , sweetie .
i need you .
i'm her mother .
miss smith?
it's okay .
thank you .
don't leave me .
so , do you hate me?
not you , per se .
i hate the way your hair falls in your face .
and i hate the way your voice gets really low when you're serious .
and i hate the way you bite your bottom lip when you're nervous .
and the way your eyebrow goes ... like that .
i hate that .
so , that's it?
you just hate the way i walk and talk and look?
no .
that jedi mind trick thing?
i hate that .
don't give up on me .
i'm not .
but you are gonna regret ever having messed up .
'cause i'm gonna make you pay for a long time .
but first ...
you're going to take three steps towards me .
and you're going to wrap your arms around my waist .
and on the count of three ... two ...
we're gonna dance .
