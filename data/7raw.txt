what are best friends for?
how are you gonna pay for this fancy shmancy academy anyway?
i'm just gonna use the money my parents gave me when i promised they never had to see me again .
but check this out , though .
the pine mountain academy was founded by colonel jaffe , retired , " and since its conception they have produced three gold medalists , four national champions and a saturday morning cartoon series in the netherlands .
hey , maybe you just might fall in love with an academy member .
maybe i will .
they have a state of the art training facility .
check out this pipe !
and they have the steepest vertical in the country .
what's it called?
the goat .
only two men have ever skied it and lived .
oooh !
the goat !
death trap .
very cool .
it also says that the locals are a group of colorful natives happy to serve your every need , and only academy members are allowed on the slope .
how's it going , cornhole?
i meant colonel .
well , i'll tell you , boys .. it's not goin 'that good .
you see , i was about 90 seconds into a three minute soft boiled when i saw you little shitbirds crappin 'on my snow .
we just pissed !
we meant no disrespect , brah .
well , i guess it's no surprise to me that you hogs can't read .
you little cocksuckers got five seconds to get off my mountain !
let's time it !

aaargh !

i've only been here for 11 years .

now , here's a tip .
never call him " coach .
you have to call him " colonel .
or he'll hurt you in places that don't show .
funny !
yeah ..
i get it .
he's probably the nicest guy in the world , isn't he?
at ease , lizzie !
i'll take this young man from here .
a day early !
i like that .
shows keen interest .
shows desire .
it's a good quality .
unless you've been invited over for dinner .
billy wagstaff .
william wagstaff , venice beach , california .
i know .
i recognize you from your application video .
shows some raw talent , son .
well , you know , the video's a year old .
i go some new moves i can't wait to show you .
i'm all chicken skin just thinkin 'about it .
colonel jaffe , retired .
i'm also the coach here at the academy .
ah .
what do you prefer?
coach " or " colonel "?
i prefer " god .
but that would be unseemly .
i'd show you around the academy myself , son , but i'm a little busy right now .
so i'm gonna have my daughter winter give you the grand tour .
winter !
report to admissions office , double time , soldier !
do you copy?
i'm coming , daddy !
i'm coming !
copy that !
thank you .
go , go .
that's real attractive , brandt .
i'm her daddy .
yes , daddy?
winter , i want you to meet billy wagstaff , a new member of the academy .
billy , meet winter .
that's an interesting name , winter .
so is ..
billy .
i named her winter because she's as pure as the driven snow .
i hear different and someone dies .
now , i want you to show wagstaff here everything the academy has to offer , little girl .
and save that halfpipe till last .
all right?
we got the best halfpipe in the country , son .
yeah?
what happened to the other half?
very humorous .
i want you back here at 0600 for orientation .
maybe you can see how funny myworld is .
man .
let's go , mr. wagstaff .
hey , winter .
why don't you let me show the new guy around?
i'm sure you've got better things to do .
thought i did , but they weren't any better .
i'd be more than happy to show the new member around myself .
come on .
whoo !
yeah , winter !
looking good !
wait till you see the gorge .
it's tight and wet , but it sure feels good when you go down it .
race you to the bottom .
you got it .
well?
it's great .
everything is great .
can we ride it?
and can you go first?
you know , just give me the lay of the land .
who told you my nickname?
oh ho .
follow me if you can keep up .
keeping up is no problem .
god , i love her .
this is a little move i like to call " keep the change .
make sure the steam is blowing up against the boobies so the na nas stand up .
then make sure you get some foam on the ta tas .
and then dip with your finger like this .
and then put your finger all the way in your mouth to lick it off .
there you go .
that'll be four dollars .
keep the change .
that was so .. cool .
yep .
these tits are practically paying for themselves .
i don't think i have the na nas , the ta tas , the boo boos or the ba bas for that .
you're right .
those aren't exactly moneymakers .
but i think we can work with that little ass of yours .
get me a muffin .
ok .
oh , yeah , that works .
looks like i got a new muffin girl .
so , what dorm are you staying in?
oh , i can't afford to .
my friend and i are getting a place in town .
in town?
you're gonna live with the poories?
poories?
that's what we call the locals in schittville .
poories 'cause they're poor .
get it?
poor .. ies .
yeah , um ..
i guess that makes me a poorie .
what do you guys call yourselves?
the richies , 'cause you're rich .. ies?
as a matter of fact , we do .
oh .
clever .
yeah .
i hope you were clever enough to wear a lot of warm clothes .
why?
because i don't hang out with poories .
see you in another life hopefully a richer one .
bye bye .
aaaarghhh !
god , i'm in love .
casey richards , welcome to paradise !
oh .
huh?
i think you made the right choice coming to blind danny temples for all your realty needs .
now , just so you know , the trick to being blind is to memorize your surroundings .
that's the key .
oh , god !
oh , my god !
don't help me , don't help me .
i'm not a cripple , i'm not a cripple .
cane , cane , cane , cane , cane !

yeah , it's not too bad for a couple of poories .
poories?
what's that?
it's what they call us at the academy .
why?
because we're poor?
well , actually , yeah .
ok , so what do they do?
they call themselves the richies?
no .
yes .
hey , is this the ..?
no talking in the lecture hall .
well , how are we gonna get a lecture if there's no talking in the lecture hall?

show these goofballs why i let you into school !
what was that , wagstaff?
huh?
all that wigglin 'around up there .
you look like you got a combination of tourette's and the runs .
ha ha ha !
maybe i should dig up katharine hepburn , throw her in there .
she'd give me a smoother run .
i've always been a big fan of her work .
oh !
he's got the balls to sass me !
i think i know how to get the punk out of you .
how about a nice long ride all the way down the mountain , huh?

oh , don't be such a pussy !
i see the problem .
your lower back is in spasm .
i'm gonna have to stick some needles in your ass now , sweetie .
um ..
but my butt feels fine .

your butt looks like that guy from hellraiser .
he's gonna be as good as new in about an hour .
my work here is done .
now i'm gonna get myself all prettied up for the party tonight .
whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa !
what about the needles?
hm .
casey?
yank 'em out in about half an hour .
don't be gentle .
is that part of the therapy?
no .
it's just more fun that way .
toodles !
wow .
that is the sweetest , sexiest , most brutal woman i've ever met .
i think she kinda digs me .
really?
aargh !
you know , back in the day , there wasn't no richies or poories .
there was just whities .. and then there was others .
and guess who got to ski the goddamn mountain .
it wasn't like they said black folk could only ride the slushy hill , but , hell , we knewwhat " others " meant .
it wasn't like we didn't have our own rules on the slushy hill .
i was a poor motherfucker back then , and i could only afford one ski .
so i rode that slushy hill on one .
you invented snowboarding?
i called it " boogie woogie one ski .
then i realized there was only one way to free up the mountain so all men could use it , and that was to do the one thing that no man had ever done before : ski the goat .
i boogie woogie one skied that goat , and for years after , all men and bitches too could ski pine mountain .
oh , it was beautiful , babies .
but , like everything beautiful , people fucked it all up .
i tried to stop 'em , but ..
i was pretty fucked up my damn self .
well , that's when the colonel .. the motherfucker stole my one ski idea and had the mountain declared a private skiing academy .
then we was all back on the slushy hill .
brah , why don't you go do all that shit again and get our mountain back for us?
yeah !
how am i supposed to do that , balls?
pretend i'm not tired , bitter and drunk?
check it out .
it's the guys from the cafe .
yeah .
let's just go this way .
no , no .
be polite .
hey !
let me buy you brahs a couple of glasses of suds .
actually , you know , i'm not a bra , mister .
i'm a man .
bras are what are used to hold up women's breasts .
look , we're only being nice to you
'cause we like the new muffin girl with the dope ass .
and now we're not gonna buy you any suds .
academy members only .
william wagstaff .
i should be somewhere on the list .
oh , yeah .
you're the new half poorie kid .
and you are ..?
casey richards .
she's not in the academy .
she's my guest .
sorry .
only members of the academy can be guests .
thanks !
billy , i'm gonna go hang out with the less classy group over there .
yeah , yeah .
shot?
bubbles ..
yeah .
hey , winter .
um , yeah .
fuck off , sweetie .
hi !
hey .
hi , billy .
come on .
don't tell me you're upset 'cause you're not over there with your buddy .
let me tell you something about losin 'a man .
there ain't one alive worth sheddin 'a tear over .
drink up , sister .
so you've never been in love?
maybe if i could find the guy that could see past my incredible good looks , perfect figure and the sexiest mouth god ever created .
but i don't know if i could find a guy like that in schittville .
maybe he's sitting right next to you .
somebody better get danny away from that beaver before he fucks it again .
so you didn't tell me you even had a poorie girlfriend .
somebody might need a blood test .
casey?
she's not my girlfriend .
i've known her since i was , like , six .
she's kind of like my sister .
i don't know .
she's very pretty .
she is?
look at him , sittin 'over there like he owns the damn place .
i hate that asshole .
he can suck my ..
black cock !
and he knows it too .
straight , upstandin ', cheap ass whiskey drinkin 'motherfucker !
bitch !
daddy , look who i found .
well !
enjoy your hike there , son?
or did my mountain kick your ass?
my butt's seen better days , sir .
well , why don't you get yourself a nice massage tomorrow up at the academy?
just don't let that big titted whore at the coffee house stick any needles in your ass .
i hear she almost bled some poor son of a bitch to death .
hi .
i'm brandt von hoffman , pine mountain academy team captain .
second in command .
casey richards .
let me be right up front with you .
i'm a poorie , and proud of it .
are you kidding?
i don't play all that stupid richie poorie crap like the rest of those snobs .
no .
to me , people are people .
rich or poor , there's good and there's bad people .
but if you're into that kind of segregation thing , i can split .
no , no !
i ..
i just can't believe i met someone who isn't .
so .. if i asked you to have a drink with me you'd do it?
yeah , i'll be right back .
i'd love to .
casey !
oh , case .
i'm sorry , i think i might have been inside for a long time .
brandt , this is my friend billy .
i know billy !
awesome ride on the slopes today , brah .
this guy is one heck of a snowboarder .
i'm so glad you could make it .
casey and i were about to grab a drink .
can you join us?
yeah ..
no .
i gotta pee really bad .
and i think my ass might be bleeding .
good luck with that .
ok .
i drank too much .
hi , handsome .
i've been looking for you .
jesus , winter !
you're not supposed to be in here .
are you sure?
your lips say no ..
but your stream says yes !
you want me to tap that off for you?
no , no , no !
i'm fine , thank you .
you want me to suck it for you?
i'm gonna have to say yes to that .
sven , front and center .
ja , colonel .

never from the front i swear it !
jeez !
does your father know you do stuff like this?
god , i hope so .
hey , j. p. , the colonel's mad dogging you right now .
well , goddamn .
so he is .
hey , balls , you gonna let him do that to me , your hero?
after that story?
no way , brah .
i got something right here in my pocket for him .
well , bust it out .
he's giving you the bird !
the double bird !
bitch of a son !
are you just gonna sit there?
or are you gonna do something about it?
jawohl !
hey , poories !
freibier !
dude , that hit me right in the head !
goddamn , boy !
you can't let people hit you in the head with beer bottles !
j. p. 's right .

thank you very much , my brother .
swing , danny !
nailed him !
ja .

jeez ..
yes ..
oh , yes !
nothing like a well deserved evacuation of the bowels , son .
that sounds like your father .
perfect .
what the hell is goin 'on in there?
you gotta go .
go !
colonel !
i was just ..
i know what you were doin ', you goddamn animal .
we don't go in for that up here at pine mountain .
i don't knowwhat kind of .. small , blond man you found to perform fellatio on you here in a public environment , but i'm sure his father feels shame unlike any father has ever felt since the dawn of time .
i don't like you , wagstaff .
you're always doin 'something that you shouldn't be doin '.
dancing on the slopes , disobeying a direct order , havin 'sex in a shitter with what was clearly a man .
matter of fact , you just made it to the top of my shit list .
thank you , sir .
you won't be disappointed .
all right !
we can't have nice nice .
move out !
the black man just kicked his own ass .
i got my eye on you , blind man .
i got my ear on you .
nazi fag !
elevate , you limp dicked mother hump ..
it's pathetic .
wankers !
i'm surrounded by wankers .
i guess you wanna hear me say that that was creative and inventive and fun to watch .
is that what you were thinking , wagstaff?
i was told it was impolite to ever refuse a compliment , sir , so .. please , can i hear what you thought?
here's my thought , dipshit .
watching you felt like .. a small , intensely powerful wolverine eating a sack o 'nuts out of my anus .
get to my office .
now !
aagh !
ok , mr. osama .
where are you?
over there?
ooh !
boom !
colonel jaffe .
now , i may not be a mind reader .. but i think i know what you were gonna say .
you want me to be team captain .
i don't think i've been here long enough to have gained the respect and admiration of the other guys .
but , um ..
what the hell .
i accept .
you know , that's just a crazy enough idea to actually work .
captain wagstaff .
really?
so i'm off your shit list?
no , you puke .
i've just spent more than a day and a half trying to mold you into an olympic caliber snowboarder .
i just realized that i've been polishing a turd .
you are fuckin 'expelled .
huh .
well , thank you for you support , sir .
who would i see about getting a tuition refund?
you're lookin 'at him , scumbucket .
guess what?
i'm going to impound that homo blowjob slush fund .
all right .
i'm leaving .
ooh .
there's something i could tell you about last night that would devastate you .
but i got too much class for that .
gossip?
wait , get back here .
you're not dismissed !
what they say?
let's say that , between you and me , " winter " came a little early last night .
leave it at that .
how dare you?
i've heard that vicious lie from every man on this mountain , and they're all liars !
get out of here before i kill you with my bare hands !
why , why , why?
why me?
oh , god .
jack?
come to me , jack .
come up now .
now i need you .
ahhh !
i'll be ok?
i'll be ok?
i'll be ok !
i'll be ok .
yes , sir !
yes , sir .
this is colonel jaffe .
cadet wagstaffhas just been expelled .
code red .
ohh !
bye bye , billy !
come on , guys .
that's so you can breathe , wagstaff .
because we are no monsters , you know .
you like hanging out with the poories so much?
maybe you can show them some of your fancy moves .
i love it when the colonel orders a code red .
just the sound of that body thumping on the inside of that can .
you guys go hit the practice slopes .
i'll be in town fucking the dead guy's girlfriend .
that's why him is the captain .
good boy .
ja .
he is one bad fuckermother .
we better go hit the slopes before we end up in can of trash too .
ja .
$500 for your thoughts .
well , i'm still a little mad at billy , but now i'm starting to get worried .
listen , your friend got himself in a lot of trouble before he quit the school .
he stole his tuition money back .
he practically attacked the colonel's daughter .
and he seemed to be involved in some sort of homosexual men's room scam .
i've known billy my whole life .
that just doesn't sound like him .
unfortunately , there's just some people in this world who act nice , but in truth they're not very nice at all .
have some more wine .
and try not to worry so much .
you're right .
the one thing i know about billy is that he's a survivor .
he's probably out on the beach right now , partying the night away .
oh , sweet savior .
what happened to that billy dude casey came up here with?
i thought she was all up on his dick .
she is .
it's one of those things any fool can see but them .
and me .
ok .
that is the last time i take a shit in this can .
oh , shit .
i heard some dude was blowing him in the bathroom last week during that fight we had when the richies kicked our ass .
yeah , that was a good fight .
yeah !
what are you guys so happy about?
you lost .
they beat you like rugs .
maybe we are giant losers .
i mean , even casey , our muffin girl , is dating a richie .
oh , billy shmilly .
i love schittville .
salt .
a salted road .
i'm on a salted road !
oh , sweet jesus , i'm in the road .
here comes the pain .
brandtsy .
so what is this?
like , our .. third date?
fifth .
what the fuck is wrong with that nasty looking and smelly motherfucker?
if you're here for more acupuncture , i'm all booked up .
listen , everybody .
i know we got off on the wrong foot , but .. five days duct taped into a trashcan . can change a man .
yeah .
into garbage .
do you mind?
would you let the motherfucker finish?
or else he ain't gonna leave .
thank you .
look ..
we can't let the richies do this to us anymore .
i admit , when i first got here , i was a jerk .
i was trying to be someone that i'm not .
and i was wrong .
yeah , something most of us learned in the fourth grade , but , please , go on .
well , i learned a couple of things and i wanna share 'em with you .
first , is that a human being can live off the lickings of a garbage can for five .. long .. days .
another thing we learned in the fourth grade .
how about this?
we don't have to kowtow to the richies anymore .
question .
kowtow?
goddamn , they're stupid motherfuckers .
get pushed around , idiot .
oh !
like the richies do to us .
kowtow !
wait a minute .
we hate kowtowing .
yeah !
i'll cut the next bitch that kowtows me .
the point is , we need to take back what belongs to schittville .
it smells like you done took plenty back already .
i'm talking about the mountain .
and our honor , and our dignity .
honor and dignity?
that's some pretty redundant shit for five days 'work .
poopy pants is right .
we need to take back our shit , including casey our muffin girl , unless brandt von hoffman's kowtowing her right now .
can you use it like that?
i think you can .
whoa .
wait , wait .
casey is kowtowing brandt?
why don't you take me back to my place so we can fuck like wild dogs?
i can put both my feet behind my head .
check !
but i do have to go put a stop to that right now .
you might want to wash the crap out of your pants first , dear .
she got a helluva an idea , mr. honor and dignity .
ok .
but i still have a good hunk of speech left .
we can't wait to hear it !
ok .
goddamn !
can somebody crack the window?
not you , danny , you blind son of a bitch .
case?
casey?
oh , thank god .
oh , god .
whoo !
ok , i can't do this .
what?
i'm already wearing a rubber .
the colonel says always wear a rubber .
even if you're just eating with a poorie .
right , i'm really glad you said that incredibly insulting thing .
that'll make this a lot easier .
i'm not gonna have sex with you .
i mean , our going out was a really big mistake .
i like somebody else .
that's why i moved here in the first place .
what am i supposed to do with this wood?
build a coffee table?
ok .
you're not swaying me much .
i have to ask you to leave .
not until i get what i came for .
billy !
i believe the lady said ..
wow .
what page of national geographic did he pop off of?
i don't know .
but i have a feeling you have a lot to do with this .
now , if you don't leave right now , i'm gonna ..
ohh !
i get it .
i might be rich , but i'm not stupid .
actually , yeah , you are .
bye bye .
here .
give this to your boyfriend .
he can wear it as a wet suit .
he threw a rubber on my face , didn't he?
yeah .
let me get it for you .
sorry if i ruined your date .
you did .
but not for the reasons you think .
j. p. hm?
can i buy you a drink?
oh , yeah , oh , yeah .
but , uh ..
i don't have to " follow you to your car "?
no !
jesus !
i wasn't with a guy .
i was with the ..
colonel's daughter .
how did you get at the end of that line?
i'm still waitin 'for the call .
i feel ..
i feel terrible .
i screwed everybody over and ..
i acted like an asshole .
let me tell you something .
a man who can't see that he's acting like a asshole there's a real asshole .
but a man who can admit it , that man's all right in my book .
i wrote a book , you know .
give it a skim .
it's a big .. font .
thank you very much .
i talk all about the kennedys , jimmy hoffa .. space aliens .
that bullshit moon landing .
we never go to no fucking moon .
i bought the commemorative plate for nothing .
i got a whole chapter on the president and his pretty ass wife having dinner with osama bin laden on 9/ 12 .
it's some heavy shit .
hey , back me up on this .
i taught jim morrison ..
how to boogie woogie one ski in 1989 .
i'm talking heavy shit .
he taught john lennon how to be ironic .
there's some shit about area 51 .
keep it to yourself .
i've been to area 58 .
it's sort of a rest area .
and here's one , just between the two of us .
kurt cobain killed that crazy bitch courtney love , cut off his own dick , bought him some titties , and he's courtney love .
that's her in his grave .
dig her up and find out .
there's a hole in that hole .
well , i don't know about the two of you , but i'm going to sleep .
william?
are you all right , son?
j. p.?
mm hm?
aren't you drunk?
i've never been drunk a day in my life .
i've been waiting for you , boy .
and no more bullshit between us now .
i've seen what you can do up on that mountain .
you are the finest natural born snowboarder ..
i have ever seen in my life .
now , what you got to do is get the respect of this town , and you are not going to do that by walking in with a load of crap in your pants and some dumb ass speech .
how do i get the respect of the town?
only two men have ever ridden the goat and lived .
and i'll bet everything i wish i had .. that you , billy wagstaff , are gonna be number three .
what if i'm one of the ones who dies?
well , then , at least you'll make the board .
yeah , baby .
yeah , baby .
hey , guys .
that fuckshit wagstaff , he's not as dead as we'd hoped .
and here is the kicker .
the goat he is going to ride now .
let's go .
ja .
but i thought we were gonna have sex .
who wants sex when you can watch wagstiff trying to kill himself riding the goat?
no brainer .
let's go watch that bastard break his neck .
hey , you guys .
you're not gonna believe this .
i just heard billy wagstaff is skiing the goat .
look .
the goat?
tog ruy ogta "?
what the hell does that mean?
tog ruy "?
aaagh !
go , go , billy .
go , go !
you'll never see the other side of goat's hump .
die , you sucker .
oh , fuck !
shit , i'm alive !
oh , shit .
i can't believe that bastard wagstiff boarded the goat .
maybe one of us should ski the goat .
yeah .
brandt should do it .
he's the team captain .
no way .
nootnik , you do it .
sven , it is your idea .
you do it .
no .
no !
make hans do it .
why me?
make schlomo do it .
schlomo can't do it .
you must do it .
no , you do it .
no , you do it .
you do it , hans .
no , you do it .
no , you do it .
you do it .
you do it .
doesn't anyone want to do me?
you do it .
here's to billy " who the man " wagstaff , who boarded the goat and gave us poories a hero .
we love you , brah .
billy , billy .
now would be the right time for that speech , which is funny , yet motivates us to become better people .
yeah !
yes , thank you , j. p.
wow .
i guess i'd just like to say that when i was trapped in the trash , the one thing that kept me going was knowing that all of schittville was out there looking for me .
yeah ..
huh .
yeah .
i did learn what i valued most in life , and that is friends .. freedom .. and , of course , food and air .
and the right to board where we want to board .
yeah .
right on , brother .
damn , this is some speech .
so let's raise a glass , you guys .
to a new era on pine mountain .
and let's end this ridiculous distinction between richies and poories and let's make this a place where every single person is welcome and accepted .
yeah .
and get those assholes outta here .
they put me in a garbage can and left me to die .
i wanna talk to you , wagstaff .
your days on the mountain are over , old man .
billy boarded the goat .
you know the rules .
i know the law of the mountain .
i know that any team can challenge any other team to a chinese downhill , no holds barred race to the bottom for total domination of pine mountain , and i say you poories haven't got the guts .
hell , yeah .
yeah .
all right , gentlemen .
listen up .
there's absolutely no way in hell you can lose this race if you board good and hard .
now , there's a lot at risk here , so i'm leaving nothing to chance .
step up and grab a piece of insurance .
ja !
but , colonel , why do we need the medieval weapons or clubs of death?
because we're not taking a chance .
he just explained this , you stupid australian .
but i am hungarian .
well , if you're so hungry , eat me .
ja !
ja !
all right , the winners rule the mountain .
the losers .. don't rule the mountain .
you just said the same damn thing twice , you redundant talking , big truck driving , one ski boogie woogie idea stealing , ho raising , dumb signposting motherfucker .
yeah !
why don't you have another beer , you adjective throwing ,
will smith loving , lie telling , big book writing that ain't nobody ever gonna read idiot?
yeah !
there's some heavy shit in there .
you really ought to give it a skim .
look , i think we all knowwhat's at stake and that j. p. wrote a book with some very heavy shit in it .
now , please , can we just race?
who's gonna say " go , " brah?
who's not boarding?
gee , i wonder who everybody's looking at .
come on , honey .
this way .
i know you hate me , billy , but , really , good luck .
thank you , winter .
you can watch my butt .
come on .
hang on to your jewels .
hey , j. p. ! .
you're sure easy to see in the show .
kiss my black ass , you crazy white devil .
look who it is billy's little slut girlfriend .
i hate you .
you fucking bitch !
whoo !
whoo !
whoo !
damn you , wagstaff .
you know i love you , don't you?
yeah .
yeah?
naomi , what i'm asking you is .. if you'd be my seeing eye wife .
yes , danny .
because even though you can't see my mind boggling beauty on the outside , you can see my mind boggling beauty on the inside .
i'm the happiest guy in the world .
danny , honey , you're kissing a dead beaver .
i don't care .
i love you anyway .
that beaver's not dead .
that is one lucky , no seeing , beaver licking ,
naomi hugging son of a gun .
hey , brahs , the colonel , winter and the richies are here .
this is a private party , you no contest winning motherfuckers .
but that fine daughter of yours , she can stay .
but you other tight ass bitches , get the fuck out of here .
actually , we're just here to say goodbye , because you poories have ruined snowboarding for us .
so we're taking our olympic skills elsewhere because i've invented a new sport .
it's called one board boatless water skiing .
that's surfing , motherfucker .
africans invented that shit trying to get off your goddamn slave ships by hanging on to pieces of driftwood headed for the motherland .
it's in the book , fool .
give it a skim .
oh , skim that book high and hard , supertan .
you know , i think the important thing is here that you're leaving .
no , billy .
the important thing is ..
this is leaving , ok?
wrap it up .
and you poorie chicks are gonna be missing out on this .
oh , who are we fooling?
we poories should be fighting with the richies .
it's what we do .
whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa !
stop , you guys .
why do the richies and poories always have to be fighting each other?
why can't we just make schittville the example for the whole world?
all right , gentlemen .
greener pastures .
hold on one second , guys .
you're lucky we're leaving , wagstiff .
if we weren't , i don't think it would be too long before little casey here starts begging for a piece of what's in this package .
goddamn , some more heavy shit for my book .
give it a skim .
roll cameras .
cue marker .
hey , brandt .
i'm counting on you to hold me there , boss .
keep rolling .
that fucking hurt my leg .
still rolling?
still rolling .
great .
thank you .
do it two times .
marker .
oh , god !
that beaver's not dead .
what happened to my chair?
yes , i just hurt my ass .
oh , my god .
your lips say no .
i'm billy wagstaff .
what the fuck is wrong with that nasty smelling and looking motherfucker?
sorry .
it's billy wagstaff .
what the fuck is wrong with that nasty looking and smelly motherfucker?
but i got a really good hunk of speech left .
what was that?
well , good .
i'm happy .
i like " nazi fag . " good line .
blow me .
hot stuff .
i bet i could hear that if i tried , and maybe a little labia flapping kind of action .
i mean , you know , i felt her face .
she's a good looking girl , and , you know , come to think of it ,
i wouldn't mind putting my mouth right .. if i could get a mouthful of that camel toe .
all that about labias flapping and camel toeing and shit .
white people .
you wouldn't know anything about that , would you ..
colonel?
hey , kate .
listen , i'm not an educated man , and i wouldn't know strasberg from stanislavski , but i thought that was a little on the indicate y side .
hey , kate .
if overacting was sexy , i'd be hard as a fucking rock right now .
hey , kate .
william shatner just called .
he wants his acting style back .
oh , god , forgive me .
what do you know?
wait .
i'm going to hell .
i'm going directly to hell .
well , there you go , boys .
it's all true what they told you .
damn , look at the bucket of junk sticking out of those pants .
thank you , thank you .
good to see you .
i love you ..
good to see you .
good ..
doggone , doggone .
you really , really , really know how to make a fella feel welcome .
and as i scan the crowd here , i see a few new faces .
and if any of you don't know me ,
i am jack schitt .. the third .
we love you , jack !
i love you too , man !
somebody get a video camera .
a what?
oh , yeah .
i guess we're just gonna have to use our rememberers .
your rememberers?
oh , lord .
we truly are in the town that time forgot .
they say his house is so opulent , he has his own driveway .
i would too if i made jack schitt money .
now , very rarely do i get a chance to interface with the youth of the community .
i thought this was a prime opportunity .
the first nugget of wisdom i need to share with you is to stay off the doggone drugs .
even pot?
oh , no , no , no .
pot's ok .
that's medicinal .
i'm talking the hard stuff .
what about cocaine?
no , no , no .
i got no problem with cocaine .
i mean , as a matter of fact ,
i've been known to do a bump or two in the morning to get me out of bed .
i am talkin 'the hard drugs .
ecstasy?
ecstasy .. is a tool .
it's not a drug .
as a matter of fact , i got a belly full of it right now !
now , drugs is just a minor part of the problem .
the big thing i want you to remember , for the love of mike , is to stay in school .
i'm 31 .
school's not really an option for me .
jack schitt is a straight shooter .
and if you're over 30 , and you're havin 'trouble with the readin 'and writin ',
i'm not gonna tell you that's a plus .
mr. schitt , is anything about us a plus?
i'll see y'all at the schittville holiday parade .
thank you very much !
thank you !
love you .
i love you , man .
i love you !
i love you .
man , they sure could use a man like that in washington .
that big talkin ', corny dressin ', out of style , bolo tie wearin 'motherfucker .
i hate that motherfucker .
