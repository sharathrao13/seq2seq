he's fighting hard against it
he's not ready yet
the spirit of the plants can teach you the secrets of life
broken nose
if one day you decide to know yourself you'll have to choose the warrior's path
you'll reach the darkness of your spirit
then , if you overcome your fears you will know who you are
broken nose " !

broken nose
are you joining us?
i met a white psychic
he steals people's souls
i must heal her i must do it right away
then she'll be free
would you leave us now?
we will talk later
your demons are stronger than ever
they will soon reappear
now is not the time
i haven't come here to listen to your sermons
i know what you wish to speak to me about
the sacred mountains
there's an expedition they're looking for gold from the sacred mountains
they have a map
no
there is another man
the one she met
he is not seeking gold
what are you worried about?
what's he seeking?
the sacred power
our secret is threatened
he knows
i didn't kill him he's a victim of a vengeance
a white man says he was attacked
on his way to riata
it's the scalp of the black man
he was headed for the sacred mountains
i'm taking him to runi
runi is not one of us the body belongs to us
i'm taking him to runi
i'm not your enemy
i'm not your enemy
go ahead !
chiricahua , kill me !
go ahead !
