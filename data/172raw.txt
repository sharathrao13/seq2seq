so beautiful .
what's that?
did you feel something?
yeah , i feel something .
hey , get back here !
turn up the music !
we're having a party , man .
you guys are having fun .
boat's rocking .
stop !
you're paranoid !
listen .
did you hear that?
listen , listen .
you hear that?
what is that?
everybody , shh !
stay up there .
what is that?
come on !
okay , we've had some problems at the facility .
what we're attempting to achieve has never been done .
we're this close to the reactivation of a human brain cell .
doctor ... ... the $200 million i sunk into this company is due in great part to your research .
but when the market opens monday ... ... despite my reputation , i don't like heights .
especially falling from them .
i'm sorry , honestly .
tell me , mr. franklin , have you ever known anyone with alzheimer's?
well , no .
by the end , all my father could do was ask why my mother wasn't at home .
each time i said she was dead , i saw him take the loss like a car wreck .
200, 000 men and women develop alzheimer's each year .
what if you could end all that suffering with a single pill?
give me till monday morning .
48 hours .
i'll give you results that'll skyrocket your stock price ... ... or i'll help you pack the lab myself .
it's your call .
that was an impressive speech you gave back there .
i read that article on you .
the thing in the himalayas .
alps .
right .
we were just trying to do something together .
having fun .
things went bad .
but you saved all those people .
not all .
navy built it for wwii submarine loading ... ... refueling .
when they mothballed it , we picked it up , added aquatic pens , underwater labs .
your dime , i guess .
looks like alcatraz floats .
what do you think?
she's a 12 footer .
she's beautiful .
she wants to give you a big kiss .
i bet .
she's got a license plate jammed in her mouth .
it's a good deal , " amigo " .
drop her , billy !
russell franklin , janice higgins .
marine biologist .
jan will get you settled .
welcome to our island paradise .
where's tattoo?
you know , short guy?
the plane , boss !
the plane !
right .
i am getting old .
how much do you know about our facility?
treat me like a tourist .
i hate tourists and i've decided i'm going to like you .
louisiana .
i think he was bought in a pet shop in baton rouge .
ate everything in his tank , and then ate the guy that bought him .
next day , fills up the cab of the guy's truck with water and drives to baja ... ... picking bones out of his teeth with the license plate .
we need to talk .
later .
carter blake , russell franklin , president of chimera pharmaceuticals .
that was incredible .
actually , they don't like the taste of us very much .
if they bite you , it's because they think you're a fat little seal .
or a rich suit .
nice meeting you .
friendly place .
you got full sentences .
usually , he just kind of nods .
word travels fast about why you're here and all .
was that the gen 1 that escaped?
that little guy?
no way .
those are the normals .
these three are the test sharks .
two first generation and one second generation female .
beneath its glassy surface ... ... a world of gliding monsters .
it's pretty scary stuff , huh?
yes .
it is .
tower to water taxi .
ben , i'm picking up a nasty little bitch of a squall about 30 miles out .
over .
copy that .
we'll be all right .
jan , stay out of the rain .
where are they going?
they hate me too?
they're going home .
we run a skeleton crew on the weekend .
but they probably hate you anyway .
there's dr. jim whitlock , the most brilliant man ever .
he's pissing into the wind .
how brilliant can he be?
you'll see .
what happened , deadeye?
you miss with the first shot?
it took two hits to even slow it down .
are you kidding?
two of these should've almost killed it .
go tell it that , scoggs .
you missed .
don't get mad at me because you can't shoot worth a shit .
if you hadn't left the pen open , i could've had a good sleep .
i already told the doc , i locked the pen like i do every night .
the fish got out some other way .
what are you looking at me like that for?
who are you going to trust?
me , that's who .
you trust me .
you know why?
because i'm trustworthy .
how high are these fences off the water?
given the surface variations and tensile strength
short answer , man .
eight feet , give or take a centimeter .
i'm sorry .
i'm making aquatica sound like a mental hospital .
no , not really .
well , maybe a little .
the truth is , it is .
but almost everyone here is top of their game .
living below is like living in space .
you don't get very many mistakes .
besides the catwalks ... ... you bought us titanium based fencing around all the lagoon and pens .
there are three sub levels .
sub level one is living quarters .
wet lab and workshops .
engineering and air locked wet entry .
welcome to aquatica .
did you dose the gen 2 with the serum?
i had carter do it as soon as you called .
it should be ready tomorrow night .
but?
we will not be ready .
two months ahead of schedule .
we're skipping three rounds of preliminary trials .
no choice .
you wait your whole life for a single moment ... ... and then one day , it's tomorrow .
so what exactly does a shark wrangler do?
pretty much what it sounds like , i guess .
how'd you end up here at aquatica?
i like the water .
pay is good .
an aga mask !
did some wreck diving in one of these , off the coast of spain .
tourist thing .
do you like wreck diving?
it's okay .
i bet you're really good at it .
we're on the water .
whole cat and mouse thing don't float .
you're the man , right?
yeah , i'm the man .
the man's always got a file .
what's it say?
two years , leavenworth .
smuggling .
how'd you make your money?
you the first rich guy in history who's squeaky clean?
you do understand my concern , right?
look , i got a workable deal here .
i don't make waves .
i meet the terms of my parole .
i'm not out to change the world , like the doc .
i'm not out to wreck it either .
eat me , asshole !
hey , you dickhead !
fat butt !
you got a big , fat butt .
you know what , bird?
you're trying my last nerve .
don't make me drown your feathery ass .
get myself a cat .
that's good .
yes .
that's good .
that's it .
you got a nasty looking tongue , you know that?
feeding time .
i'm releasing the tiger shark in 30 seconds .
copy?
i hear you .
i'm going in .
you guys hungry?
dr. mcalester , we have a situation up here .
could you please come to surface level?
dr. mcalester , could you come to surf ace level , please?
surprise !
happy birthday !
damn , i hate that song .
you like the tunes there , preach?
carter , join us .
there's too much woman on this deck for scoggs to handle .
vodka , straight .
and by the way , food was excellent , brother .
you're that guy that got caught in that avalanche , right?
i'm the one .
black men have enough ways to get killed ... ... without climbing up some mountain in the middle of nowhere .
you need to leave that to the white folks , " brother .
happy birthday?
i'll let you know tomorrow .
how's life underwater?
it's a lot less complicated ... ... than it is on the surface .
that's for sure .
nice work with that new tiger shark today .
one day , you'll have to tell me how you learned that .
one day , you'll take me up on that beer and maybe i will .
it's all work for me , carter .
but , like you said , " one day .
sharks never get cancer , go blind or show loss of brain activity as they age .
unlike some people i know .
sharks are the oldest creatures on the planet ... ... from a time when the world was just flesh and teeth .
by using a hormonal enhancer ... ... we increased this female's forebrain to five times its normal size .
to harvest more protein .
exactly .
a protein that may reactivate
that will .... ... that will reactivate human brain cells stored in the forebrain of the shark .
i'm just amazed that we've come so far , so fast , without genetic tampering .
genetic engineering to increase brain mass violates the harvard genetics compact .
not to mention chimera policy .
they're hunting in packs .
like wild dogs .
they'll only eat other sharks .
you're reading too much into it .
that gen 1 attacked a 25 foot boat .
am i reading too much into that too?
did you tell franklin?
i'm just a fish keeper , lady .
but bringing in that shark ahead of schedule was a very bad idea .
do you like your job?
are you threatening me , doc?
no .
but if we don't pull off that test tomorrow , we're all on the street .
you're a good man , carter .
but with your background ....
right .
how's miss smarty pants?
hope she's not as dumb as she seems .
raise those fences like i asked?
i took care of it .
let's go get a beer .
all craft warnings for waters south of the us mainland and west of ca .
a tropical depression is generating gale force winds ... ... and is associated with heavy rains and ocean swells to 30 feet or more .
any of your nonsense , and we'll have tiny drumsticks on the menu tonight .
fat butt !
that's right .
you can ... all you want .
welcome to my parlor , mr. franklin .
wow .
wet lab , we're taking a pounding up here .
can't see past my nose .
so i suggest you check pen monitors and lagoon monitors .
i can't imagine there's much visibility below .
carter , you copy?
okay , i'm approaching the tunnel .
bingo .
elvis has left the building .
we picked you up , but visibility's near zero .
no problem .
how long have they been synchronized like this?
tell me i didn't see that .
they recognized that gun !
that's impossible .
sharks can't swim backwards !
try to stay focused .
what was that?
we lost picture in gen 2 pen .
okay , hold on .
carter , do you copy?
carter , do you copy?
carter , talk to me , man .
do you copy?
cut the crap !
you're scaring everybody .
boarding platform engaged .
he's got her .
did someone order the fish?
what in god's creation?
no , not his .
ours .
commencing scan .
gen 2 is online .
transferring exotics to remote terminals .
vital signs to terminal 1 .
diagnostic imaging to terminal 2 .
we're live and in color !
bp , 67 over 43 .
heart rate , 50 bpm .
within norm .
she's sleeping like a baby .
bad dream?
in position .
vitals are stable .
vitals?
holding .
aspirating 4 . 5 cc .
introducing 2 cc of the protein complex ... ... into cultured , inactive brain neurons of an alzheimer's patient .
and what you're looking for here is lightning in a bottle .
protein complex is interacting with the neurons .
neurons are becoming hyperosmotic .
membrane integrity's improving .
they're firing !
they're firing !
one second .
two .
three .
still firing .
four .
five .
six .
6 . 560 seconds .
i'll be damned .
no , sir .
for 6 . 560 seconds ... ... you saw what it's like not to be damned .
congratulations .
impressed?
overly impressed .
6 . 560 seconds .
now that you've got this ... ... how long before you make something permanent?
you did it , pal .
you did it .
no !
carter , no !
are you insane?
tower , we need paramedics and evac now !
all frequencies , sos .
this is research station aquatica .
we have a medical emergency .
this is research station aquatica .
we have a medical emergency .
please respond .
x ray alpha 2 18 .
coming off oil platform chiapa .
we'll take that post you've always wanted .
got it .
he's hemorrhaging !
they say the yellow butterflies are thick as clouds there , remember?
research station aquatica , this is x ray alpha 2 18 .
have you in sight .
approaching from 0 6 0 .
copy , 2 18 .
stay with him .
keep talking .
let's move !
i'm not this kind of doctor .
just keep doing what you're doing .
where's the chopper?
tower?
come on , brenda .
where's my chopper?
franklin , this end !
keep it coming !
ready .
it's all right , honey .
hold on .
got it .
okay , move him out .
let's go !
i love you !
come on !
get up !
come on !
come on , carter !
pull up , 2 18 !
pull up !
damn !
i can't get a picture .
tower , have you got a visual?
copy .
i can't get anything .
do you copy?
going to back up .
got it !
i'm going to take this as a sign .
where is he now?
where is he?
the whole system's shut down .
brenda?
are you there?
this thing is dead .
somebody , please ... ... tell me what that is .
please .
all right , people , let's move .
now !
get to the door !
come on .
you can't help him .
the door frame is bent .
open .
open it !
turn it !
turn it !
no !
tower , can you hear me?
anyone , hello?
we got to get topside , find some help .
what?
we're flooded .
shit !
there's no other stairway from this level .
elevator?
it seals off automatically to keep the shaft from filling .
there's no way up .
all right .
okay .
if this is a lesson about the drinking , let's just say i've learned it .
no need to get carried away , showing me your vengeful side .
i know your wrath , lord .
if corridor b is dry ... ... we go back to the maintenance ladder , climb down to level 3 .
we get to the wet entry .
we take the sub topside , two at a time .
we go down to get up .
all right , let's move .
come on .
sounds like somebody made it .
over here !
we're over here !
preach?
what the hell is that?
lab equipment maybe , banging around .
think so?
not a chance .
we got to get past that door .
let's go !
come on !
open the door !
go !
go !
bird !
come on , bird !
where are you , bird?
hey , dickhead !
bird?
fat butt !
bird?
anybody here?
cowboy , let me ask you a question .
we should keep moving .
i'm talking to him !
was that a goddamn shark that broke through that door?
i expect so .
you expect so?
well , well , well .
am i the only asshole down here who thinks that a tad bit odd?
it can do that?
bust through a steel door?
i ain't the expert .
given gen 2's size and some room to move ... ... she could put a couple tons , maybe more , into a hit .
so , yeah , in my opinion .
if she wants through , she's coming .
and these sharks ... ... they aren't breaking down doors for the sheer joy of it , are they?
they're after us .
it's obvious we don't know what they're doing .
what the hell did you do to those sharks?
their brains weren't large enough to harvest sufficient amounts of the protein .
so we violated the harvard compact .
jim and i used gene therapies to increase their brain mass .
larger brain means more protein .
as a side effect , the sharks got smarter .
you stupid bitch !
i didn't want this to happen ... ... but with this research , we could wipe out degenerative brain disease .
think of the generations that would be saved .
how much dynamite do you have to set off in your ears before your head clears?
you wouldn't understand .
i wouldn't?
dumb old carter wouldn't understand that you used us?
that you used me?
someone on the water who wouldn't make waves .
someone who wouldn't ask too many questions .
because he had something to lose .
you don't see what we've done here .
you've taken god's oldest killing machine and given it will and desire .
you've knocked us to the bottom of the goddamn food chain .
it's not a great leap forward , in my book .
the people we'll save ....
jim?
brenda?
us?
all right , people .
these sharks are thinking hard and clear .
so here's the riddle .
what does an 8, 000 pound mako shark ... ... with a brain the size of a v8 engine and no natural predators , think about?
i'm not waiting around here to find out .
now you see how that works?
she screwed with the sharks and now the sharks are screwing with us .
please let me get out of here .
what if the sharks get through the fence and into the ocean?
it's okay .
the fence on the ocean side is titanium .
and it gives , so it works just like a net .
let's get to the sub .
we'll discuss it on the way to the top .
eat me , asshole .
careful , now .
come on , bird .
come on .
please , baby .
dickhead .
see daddy smiling?
come on .
bring your feathery ass here .
come on .
explosion caused that?
no .
nothing in here could've blown with enough force to move that damn sub .
whatever .
it's junk .
we could all just dive in and see who makes it to the top .
isn't that the old aquatica spirit , dr. susie?
just dive in .
you could go first , to lead by example .
he was my best friend , janice .
i'm not going in the water .
no way , man !
the sharks are in there .
listen !
we put these on .
they help fight hypothermia .
that's a start .
and unless someone's got a better idea ... ... we're going to have to swim out of here .
this isn't happening .
i'm not daniel when he faced the lion !
so i appreciate the irony , lord !
cook dies in his own oven !
but i've got other plans !
you ate my bird .
was that the surface?
no , the vibrations are too deep .
that was from inside .
i wouldn't get that close .
just a suggestion .
water's murky .
we might make it .
no way !
no , we won't !
it's 230 feet ... ... from the lagoon floor to the lagoon surface !
the average human swims two feet per second .
the average shark swims 50 feet per second .
there's no way i'm getting into that pool !
what we have here is your basic maintenance ladder .
this leads up to the surface .
i love you , scoggs .
i really do !
why do i feel a " but " coming on?
but we don't know what shape the surface level is in .
the shaft is air locked .
but if the explosion breached the shaft at surface level ... ... we won't have enough pressure to stabilize the wet pool .
if the pool isn't stabilized , there's tons of ocean dying to get in .
you'll bring the whole facility down .
we're better off with the sharks .
you want to swim with your fishes?
go ahead !
i'm opening this door and climbing out of here !
the hell you are !
i don't work for you anymore !
i don't have to take orders !
enough !
that's enough now , from all of you !
you think water's fast?
you should see ice .
it moves like it has a mind .
like it knows it killed the world once .
it got a taste for murder .
when the avalanche came ... ... it took us a week to climb out .
and somewhere we lost hope .
i don't know when we turned on each other .
i just know ... ... that seven of us survived the slide ... ... and only five made it out .
now , we took an oath that i'm breaking now .
swore that we'd say it was the snow that killed the other two .
but it wasn't .
nature can be lethal .
but it doesn't hold a candle to man .
you've seen how bad things can get and how quick they can get that way .
well , they can get a whole lot worse .
so we're not going to fight anymore !
we're going to pull together and find a way to get out of here !
first , we're going to seal off this pool !
oh , my god .
it just ate him .
it just ate him .
christ !
i'm not moving .
i'm not moving .
someone will come .
they'll come and they'll get us , and we'll be fine .
no .
i'm not moving .
listen , tom , what is the precise structural failure limit for aquatica?
3, 200 tons .
what happens when we get more than 3, 200 tons of water in this rig?
the support struts go first .
their tolerance is about seven tons .
they'll crack like toothpicks .
the walls will buckle .
they can't handle more than 10 tons of pressure .
you want to be here for that?
hell , no .
the moment of truth .
again .
go !
go !
go !
i got you .
it's burning !
the elevator's blocking the top .
if we make it to level 1 , we can take the stairs out .
let's get out of here !
go !
go !
what are you doing?
if they break through , water will bring them right to us .
level 2 is only partially flooded .
if i can get that door open ... ... the water will run off there , buy us some time .
big , real big .
what's that?
the size of your brass balls .
be careful .
go !
jan , stay there !
get me out of here , carter !
i don't want to die !
grab my hand !
come on !
i can't !
i can't reach !
take it !
i can't reach !
can you reach that door above you?
it's too high .
it's too high .
sharks probably flooded that level too .
good thing you came to this side .
the other side's underwater .
we didn't exactly plan it .
yeah , it wasn't planned .
are you all that made it?
we did it .
we're on level 1 .
we can take the stairs to the surface .
the stairs are flooded .
trust me , i know .
are you sure?
give us a goddamn break , can't you?
he always answers .
sometimes , the answer you get isn't the answer you want .
we're 60 feet from the surface .
there's an emergency hatch on this level , right?
this level has bilge pumps on it for storm runoff .
if we re route the emergency generators , we could drain a stairway .
you sure?
who you going to trust?
you .
that's right .
you trust me .
we had poker here tomorrow night .
she'd always draw to the inside straight when she could've stuck with a pair .
big dreams .
standards .
jan was a healthy girl .
something in here has to run on batteries .
nice .
where would a girl keep her ... ... thing?
what's the matter with you?
my skin's starting to hemorrhage .
the sharks smell the blood .
this'll coat it with oil .
look , carter , what you said down there ... ... maybe you were right .
everything i've done ... ... i don't think i could've done it without you .
i know , susan .
that's the problem .
four a . m .
i know .
one night feels like a whole week .
relativity .
what do you mean?
einstein's theory of relativity .
grab hold of a hot pan , a second can seem like an hour .
put your hands on a hot woman ... ... an hour can seem like a second .
it's all relative .
i spent four years at cal tech .
that's the best physics explanation i've heard .
it works .
you stay with the doc .
me and scoggs are going to try to get to the wet lab ... ... drain that stairwell .
preach?
what?
would you zip me up , please?
we got one , there's two sharks left ... ... and you and the doc are doing a little bathroom love .
they got a pill for what's wrong with you?
i need to get some things from my quarters .
research data .
the tests , they worked .
so much death around us , to risk any more life for some numbers ....
without that data , everyone dying isn't just tragic , it's useless .
death is always useless , doctor .
this is it .
stay here .
i'll be back before you know it .
what's going on?
what the hell's going on?
what is that?
it's okay !
what is that?
we're all right !
what the fuck?
it's okay .
i thought you were coming back for me .
one of your monitors is blocking the panel .
you want to help me move it?
i say we do everything right together .
right together .
hello .
my name is sherman dudley ... ... and if this message finds you , i did not survive , so this is my legacy .
i have loved the pulpit and i have loved the bottle .
i did my best to be a good husband , a f ather .
i came up wanting .
so what do i have to say to you?
what mark do i have to leave behind?
we'll begin with the perfect omelet , made with two eggs , not three .
amateurs often add milk for density .
this is a mistake .
come on !
i got you .
come on .
damn you , scoggs .
where's susan?
i'm done .
brothers never make it out of situations like this .
not ever !
did you do it?
where's scoggins?
i hate to interrupt this moment of burgeoning intimacy ... ... but can we get the fuck out of here?
is this the only way?
exits are flooded .
whole place is sinking .
it's this way or no way at all .
you can bring on the good news anytime now .
sharks are attracted to churning water , bright colors .
these extinguishers will be a distraction .
what about us?
the vest'll bring you up too fast .
your lungs'll pop like a balloon .
you weren't the sunny kid in your class .
i never went to class .
how far to the surface?
sixty feet?
there's nothing to it .
exhale on the way up , and get the hell out of the water .
i got to equalize the pressure before we blow the air lock .
i got to let the room fill up with water .
it'll only take a few seconds .
you ready?
no .
not in the least .
though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death ...
... i shall fear no evil ...
... for thou art with me ...
... thy rod and thy staff , they comfort me .
surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life ... " ... because i carry a big stick ... ... and i'm the meanest motherfucker in the valley .
two sharks down , lord .
one demon fish to go .
can i get an " amen "?
amen !
i can't hear you !
amen !
give me an " amen " !
stay with us , lord !
amen .
okay , hold on three !
ready?
one !
two !
three !
swim !
oh , my god !
it's the devil , you know .
he'll be okay if we can get out of here .
son of a bitch .
what?
those fences are titanium underneath , but on top , they're just plain steel .
they've been herding us , pushing us where they want .
using us to flood the facility .
oh , my god .
that's the answer to the riddle .
because that's what an 8, 000 pound mako thinks about .
about freedom .
about the deep blue sea .
we have to kill her .
that's the first real smart thing you've said all day .
here we go .
let's go .
we ought to get 2 . 5 sticks of dynamite out of these flares .
from up here , you ought to be able to see me spear it .
when i do , you take this end of this cable ... ... hook it up to the positive side of the boat battery .
and boom !
damn !
i can't get her !
she's too far away !
i know how to get her .
how?
bait .
she may be the smartest animal in the world ... ... but she's still just an animal .
come to mama .
no !
susan , don't !
get out of the water !
all right , lord ....
shoot it , preach !
this is for scoggins .
shoot it !
damn !
blow it , preach !
blow it !
the battery !
blow it !
do it !
bring me some sushi !
forty five foot shark ... ... and you hit me .
nice .
could've been worse .
i could've let him eat your ass .
carter , we're sinking , right?
yeah .
let me ask you something .
are you sure it was just three sharks?
yeah .
