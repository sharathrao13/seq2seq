will you be ready soon?
half an hour .
hair?
5 minutes
look .
we must show this .
no .
it's too ugly .
i'm telling you , it's super important .
i can't shoot this crap .
romain , let me introduce you .
one last light check .
come on in .
good morning , doctor .
please sit down .
how are you feeling?
how did the tests go?
a bit painful , but i was expecting worse .
feeling better now .
good .
i asked you to drop by because i got your results ,
and i must say they're not very good .
i got aids?
no , ... nothing to do with aids .
you have a tumor .
a malignant one .
cancer?
a kind of cancer , yes .
that's the lesions to my liver and lungs?
yes .
same cause .
what does that mean?
has the cancer spread?
yes .
we'll do everything to cure you .
i will not lie to you .
there's a high risk ... ... that the tumor will resist treatment , and keep growing instead .
can't it be taken out?
no .
as i told you , the tumor is spreading in multiple organs .
it's inoperable
what's more , the tests have not identified the point of origin .
what about treatment?
drugs , radiotherapy
drugs , as in chemotherapy?
yes .
out of the question .
a friend of my parents 'died from cancer 2 years ago .
he had chemo , lost his hair , stopped eating , suffered horribly ...
do not compare .
each cancer , each chemotherapy is different .
what are my chances for remission?
there's a slight chance , but it exists .
you are 31 .
you will fight .
'slight ', does that mean 50 % or 5 % odds?
5 % , right?
yes , roughly .
even less than 5 %?
unfortunately .
yes .
without treatment , how long do i have?
difficult to answer .
we're talking averages here .
in similar cases , 3 months .
but it could be 1 month .
or 1 year .
i don't see the point of heavy stuff like chemo .
it won't work anyway .
i do not judge you .
you are young ; i would rather you fight .
even if your chances are small , they are not nil .
you should grab even a single chance .
but it's your decision , and i shall respect it .
you fly to tokyo on the 15th , you land in the morning .
you shoot the 2pm vogue swimsuit issue the very same day .
you take the evening train for kyoto .
romain , are you listening?
yes .
you sure you want to go?
of course .
why do you ask?
i don't know .
lately i find you strange .
it's like nothing interests you .
of course not .
don't worry .
maybe you should take some time off , we cancel the shoots , ... ... and you come back in great shape .
you've been telling me how this is great for my career ,
that the financial stakes are high .
not if you mess the shoots up !
do you think i'm capable of that?
sometimes it is best to turn down offers , so as not to disappoint .
you already approached someone else?
no ...
i told jean baptiste .
he'd agree to go , just in case ...
tell him to get fucked .
i'm going to japan .
well , i want to tell you i love you .
i'm very ill and will die soon .
romain . food's ready !
i'm coming .
why do you lock up?
last time you used to always let me in .
these days are over .
i want to ask you something .
what , this time?
be nice to your sister .
you know she and alain are not doing great .
ok .
don't worry .
i know it's not my business , and i don't want to meddle ,
it hurts your sister that you don't show an interest in her .
you never call her , you don't talk to her ...
you already told me , you keep repeating yourself !
then make an effort , that's all .
ok .
thank you .
see how much he's grown?
he's truly adorable .
amazing how much he looks like you !
like whom?
romain .
same nose .
don't you feel like having one too?
stop it mum , please ...
you already have 2 grandchildren .
isn't that enough?
you know your mother , strong maternal instinct .
i only say this because i know ... ... romain always liked children .
isn't that true darling?
too bad your son is a fag , no offsprings from me .
romain , in a few years ... ... i'm sure adoption will be possible , whatever your sexual orientation .
shall we eat?
i'm starving .
we're signing next week ; hope it works out !
you're very well prepared .
i know but i'm stressed out .
i know the guy is very difficult to convince .
i'm not worried for you .
and you , romain , what's up?
nothing in particular .
everything ok , work wise?
yes , it's ok .
japan is canceled?
yes , not too interesting , and lots of work in paris right now .
such a shame ...
i would have loved going there ...
you were not invited .
that's what is sad .
i don't have your talent .
do you realize we have a photographer in the family , and he's never shot a picture of my kids .
that's true , and i'd love for you to take a portrait of your dad and myself ...
just like in the english magazine you showed us .
that would be fun .
don't waste your breath , he's not interested , we're not fashionable enough for him .
he prefers actresses and top models .
don't say that sophie , there was no opportunity , otherwise i'm sure romain would have done something .
no .
she's right
why do you say that?
i don't feel like taking her kids 'picture .
romain , please .
leave it , dad .
you want to know why i don't feel like it? they are your things , they belong to you .
i would have seen your face in them .
just thinking about it i feel like puking .
romain . stop it !
not surprising your man left you , i understand him .
you give him no space , feels like you made the kids on your own .
sophie !
stop it .
romain , you stop it too .
she's mad !
that's too much , romain !
why do you talk to her that way?
she's not well , she's fragile .
i'm fragile too
what's wrong with you?
drive me home please ; i'm drunk .
i broke my spectacles . it's ok , calm down ...
are things ok with sacha?
normally , neither good nor bad .
we're gonna split .
shit !
why?
like all couples , passion dies , routine takes over ...
does he still live with you?
he's out of work , no money .
if he needs a place , tell him about your aunt's spare room .
it will be cheap .
ok , thanks .
what is it you bought?
nothing .
just a bit of coke .
i thought you stopped taking that shit !
it's just once in a while .
helps me get a hard on .
good night
you know , romain ...
what?
don't do anything foolish .
your mum cannot take it .
how about you?
i cannot either .
why do you always talk about mum , her reactions , as if nothing can hurt you?
i don't know .
a habit .
pity , isn't it?
maybe i never learnt to talk about myself .
there's something i always wanted to ask you ...
yeah?
why didn't you and mum get a divorce?
because we always loved each other .
but you cheated on her ...
a few times .
so what?
i don't know .
one night when i was a kid , i woke up and spied on one of your conversations in the kitchen .
mum had found a letter from a woman .
she was crying .
you were not consoling her .
i always thought you would separate .
see?
we're still together .
do you regret it?
of course not .
why would i?
is it because of sacha you're telling me all this?
yeah , maybe .
do i scare you?
sometimes .
good night , son .
hi !
still playing that crap?
you're not 12 anymore .
where were you?
at my parents 'place .
was it good?
yeah .
the usual .
you don't love me anymore , right?
i don't know .
i don't love you either .
what game are you playing?
i'm not playing .
i'm telling you the truth .
i don't feel anything .
just a bit of lust .
some tenderness at times .
why do you tell me that now?
it's nice to tell the truth , no?
don't tell me it's painful .
i won't believe you .
do you want us to stop?
do you want me to leave?
yes .
where will i go?
what will i do?
i don't care , just beat it .
what's wrong?
you never spoke to me that way .
i'm fed up with this shit situation .
you do nothing .
you live off me .
who do you think you are?
you think you are better , with your shit photos , your self importance?
at least i don't need you to live on .
take your stuff and clear out !
you're the strongest .
happy?
now kill me .
one of these days ...
sorry .
sorry .
are you finished?
yes .
thanks .
few clients today .
business is slow .
you work here everyday?
yes , five days a week .
tomorrow is the week end .
i can rest .
good .
are you going back home?
no , going to visit my grandmother .
is she ill?
no , she's in great health .
you'right , often if we visit our grandmother , that's because she's about to die .
for me it's just to tell her i love her .
that's nice .
no .
i'm not a nice person .
do you have children?
beg your pardon?
just making conversation .
no .
no children .
single , no kids?
that's right .
miss !
yes .
sorry .
you should tell your parents .
i tried , but i couldn't .
why?
i think no one wants to hear that .
mum would smother me even more , and dad would disappear at once ...
i think that , deep down , i like it that no one knows .
to imagine the look on their faces when they'll hear the news .
did you think of the remorse , the guilt you are going to cause?
yes .
sometimes .
i don't mind .
i won't be around to see it .
it's childish .
selfish .
give me a hand .
you're not finishing your food?
no .
i'm full .
it was very good .
make an effort .
you must eat .
is that allowed?
everything is allowed now .
can i have one?
who did you tell?
no one .
only you .
your friends , colleagues?
no .
i didn't say anything .
i distanced myself , said i needed a holiday .
your sister?
are you crazy?
i didn't tell her .
she would be too happy , she would love to pity me , just like she does her children .
there's no shame in inspiring pity or tender feelings .
it could be an opportunity for you to talk to each other .
i don't feel like it .
not with her .
and sacha?
i didn't have the guts .
why did you tell me , then?
because you are like me .
you will die soon .
did you take your medication?
yes .
i'll prepare my vitamins .
we didn't go for a walk in the woods .
we could go tomorrow morning , before you leave .
never mind .
i just wanted to see the spot where we built a hut with sophie .
there are a few bits of it left .
anti oxydation . this is for the skin , this for the hair , this for bones , against osteoporosis .
this is some type of omega ,
you see , with all this ,
i will die in excellent health .
don't talk nonsense .
that's true .
you know , romain ...
what?
tonight , i would like to leave with you .
i don't know what to do .
i don't know what's good .
i follow my instinct .
after your grandfather's death , i was a wreck .
i thought i was gonna die .
so i left , i fled .
i abandoned my child .
your father .
i could not take care of him anymore , it was not possible .
i kept seeing jacques in his smile , in his eyes .
i was called a bad mother , a whore even .
your father never forgave me .
but i know i was right .
if i had not left , if i had not had all these lovers , i would have died too .
you may call it selfishness , but it's only survival instinct .
why do you tell me all this?
because we are alike .
knock knock , madam .
would you by chance have any food?
what for?
i have not eaten in two days .
i am very poor .
but i did not invite you .
romain .
have a look .
what?
look here !
a rabbit !
what's wrong?
why doesn't he move?
he must be sick .
can i bring it home to cure it?
it's no use .
they can pass you lots of diseases .
please , dad !
don't insist !
put it down .
if we leave it , it will be eaten !
nature's law , romain .
come on .
come on .
did i wake you?
no .
what's the matter?
you cannot sleep?
no .
i cannot .
do you want to talk?
no .
i just want to sleep in your bed .
you know i sleep naked .
it's ok i won't peek .
ok .
i'm ready .
you don't want to stay for lunch?
i'm not hungry .
on the road , if you are tired , make sure you stop .
ok .
this is for you .
picked them early this morning .
for my funeral?
when you don't want them anymore , throw them away .
i love you .
me too .
don't cry , or it will be too tough .
romain .
what?
wouldn't you try chemotherapy , just for my sake?
you know perfectly well it won't work .
you never know .
things can happen like ...
miracles?
yes .
you don't believe that yourself .
i believe in you !
you are sweet .
too bad we didn't meet earlier , i would have married you .
where will you go when you get back?
i'll stay home .
call me , ok?
ok .
let me take a picture .
7 euro , please .
thank you .
have a nice day .
hello .
do you recognize me?
yes .
can i sit down?
sure .
i work at the gas station across the road , i came to see my husband .
i see .
we would like to ask you something .
yes?
well , my husband has problems .
yes?
he's sterile .
so?
well .
we both find you very handsome ... we would like to ask you ... if you would accept to sleep with me .
since you are young , we thought you probably wouldn't mind too much .
he's ok with it , don't worry .
well ...
i ...
you don't have aids?
no .
we could try , if you want .
we saved a bit of money , we could pay you .
no .
don't bother .
you do not want?
i'm not interested .
i don't like children .
romain , the place is clear .
i took all my stuff .
bye .
sasha
strange , i dream a lot .
you were in my last one .
we were sleeping together .
it was sweet and very sexual at the same time .
it was making me feel good .
funny , cos you're not my type at all .
actually in my dreams i sleep with anyone .
my father , my mother ... even with myself as a kid , i guess i'm enjoying it before i die .
time heals everything , except for us .
lately you've been aggressive , violent , full of disdain towards me . while i was making efforts , trying to understand you .
trying to make overtures , maybe awkwardly but i was trying .
i don't understand your attitude , what it is you hate so much in me .
i often remember the games we played as children , that complicity that brought us together , our quarrels , our enthusiasm and that brotherly love that has disappeared and which i miss so much .
i hope to hear from you .
i've taken the first step and i now wait for yours .
your loving sister , sophie .
allo?
it's me .
romain?
yes .
it feels strange hearing your voice ...
i wanted to let you know i received your letter .
so?
do you find it ridiculous?
no .
it moved me .
it was good for me .
that's great .
you know sophie , i'd like to come and visit you but i don't quite have the strength lately .
working too hard?
yeah , that's it .
i understand .
i'm already very happy that you called .
i wanted to let you know , it's not your fault .
i'm the one not feeling too well lately , the one going a bit mad .
don't worry .
ok .
alrite , i'm gonna leave you now .
anyway , if you want to see the kids , don't hesitate to call .
ok , but you're the one i'd like to see .
not your kids .
kisses .
and i'll be waiting for your call .
kisses .
thanks , romain .
we're too short .
let's take a chair .
hello !
hello .
have you been waiting for long?
no , i just arrived .
you don't look too good are you ok?
yeah
you should get some sun .
yeah .
and you , how are you?
they finally hired me !
great .
yes , i am happy .
it's all thanks to you .
no .
i know you called to recommend me .
well , if you know ...
anyway , if they hired you it's because you had the right profile .
and you?
i hear that you stopped working?
i needed a break , and ... ... you met someone , didn't you .
why do you say that?
i know you .
incapable of staying alone !
do i know him?
no .
how old?
my age .
good , that's what you needed .
did you meet anyone new?
no .
nothing serious , one night stands .
that's what i need now : no complications !
see you soon .
you'll call me?
yeah .
well , no ...
why do you say that?
what's wrong?
you're not feeling well?
i forgot to tell you something .
what?
it's not easy to say ...
can you walk me back?
sure .
do you want a vodka?
you drink during the day now?
yeah , occasionally .
ok , one vodka .
so?
wel ...
i miss you .
is that so?
it's a bit late now , isn't it?
yeah , i know .
i'd like to ask you one thing .
what?
i would like us to make love one last time .
i want to touch you , feel your skin .
i don't feel like it .
do i disgust you?
no , i just don't feel like it anymore .
it's over .
just once .
one last time .
whatever for?
whatever for ...
funny you should say that ,
it's a phrase i keep repeating lately ,
it's stuck in my head .
except today i didn't think about it , you were the one who said it .
you know what?
i would feel like a whore ,
like i'm doing it to thank you for the job .
i don't want that .
i understand .
give me your hand .
can you feel my heart?
yes .
it's still beating .
good morning .
good morning .
i'm ready .
sorry?
you don't want anymore , it's too late?
too late?
for the kid?
no , it's fine .
if you still want , i accept .
we do it now .
this is my will .
i recognize the child mme jeannie charron is bearing whose birth is scheduled for april 9th , 2005 , and make it my sole heir .
which means it will inherit my entire wealth .
have i expressed your wishes entirely?
yes , perfect .
for the funerals , any particular wish you would like to include?
incineration .
any religious ceremony?
that's not necessary .
alright .
here's the act .
initial the first page and sign the second page .
same thing for the witnesses please .
i don't ask you out for lunch .
i'm exhausted .
and not hungry .
neither are we .
i'll take my leave now .
do you want us to give you a lift?
it's ok ; i'll take a cab .
thank you for everything .
i should be the one thanking you .
we'd like to ask you something .
but we do not dare .
what?
do you know if your illness is hereditary , for the kid?
no , don't worry .
it's a cancer .
incurable .
ah , ok .
call us if you want to see us , or if you need anything .
ok .
i would like to ask you something too .
yes?
is he moving?
no .
it's not even two months yet .
as soon as he moves , let me know .
i'll come and touch your belly .
ok .
good bye then .
will you be alright?
yeah .
i hope so .
good luck .
