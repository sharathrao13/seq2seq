welcome to the university of ithaca .
this is it , right here .
this is what we're talkin 'about .
i'm gonna give you a good tour today .
show you as much as you need to know , plus a whole lot more .
so this is the main area of the university .
you'll be getting used to this area .
this is where you congregate with your friends and classmates .
come in around me , everyone .
keep close .
don't straggle .
i've had problems with stragglers before , okay?
they get lost in the back .
they get hit by trucks , okay?
it's not pretty .
it's not pretty when it happens .
this is the
by the way , this is the joseph h. nelson memorial library here , okay?
it was built , uh it was built , uh , in the 1600s .
1600s?
it says 1951 .
that's the address .
okay?
wise ass .
that's the psychology department .
each semester you'll be expected to volunteer ... for some cutting edge experimental testing .
kind of cool .
just a tip .
when it's your turn , remember to wear loose clothes , no metal , and be prepared to receive several heavy doses of electric current .
they're watching us right now .
over there is the department of english .
i see most of you speak english already , so we can skip that one .
how long have you been going to school here?
eight years .
you don't seem to know anything about it here .
this is the worst tour ever .
this is the worst school ever .
doesn't anything cool ever happen here?
yeah , i mean , cool stuff happens here .
this university of ithaca is the coolest , coolest place in the world .
that's because he's probably never been anywhere else .
go ahead , laugh .
laugh all you want .
but the fact of the matter is , this is the setting for the greatest story ever told .
okay?
it's about this guy i knew , josh parker , and his girl friend , tiffany .
it's one of the most fascinating journeys ever .
josh and tiffany were always together , starting from when they were really little .
they did everything as a team .
once when tiffany was ten years old , she had her tonsils taken out .
josh stayed in the hospital for three straight days .
they were best friends .
and eventually what started out as friendship ... blossomed into some serious french kissing and lots of heavy petting .
you know , they spent so much time together that even their dogs started dating .
they seemed destined to be together forever .
but after high school , they faced their most challenging challenge ever . : a long distance relationship .
see , unfortunately , while josh was enrolled here at the wonderful university of ithaca ,
tiffany went off to veterinary school in austin , texas .
but they made a pact , a promise to stay true to each other , to talk every day and maintain an exclusive relationship .
that turned out to be more difficult than either of them had imagined .
tiffany !
hey , baby .
oh , my god .
you were amazing last night .
i never ever came like that before .
come on .
seriously !
i had to take two birth control pills this morning .
you wanna help me study again tonight?
forget tonight .
come over now .
let's blow this class off .
tiffany and carla can't come to the phone , but if you leave a message , we'll call you right back .
hey , tif , it's me ... again .
just wonderin 'where you are .
still tryin 'to get a hold of you .
everything's cool , though .
i'm sure i'll catch you later .
call me back , okay?
okay .
bye .
i just wanted to add something before i sent this video off .
i haven't talked to you in a few days .
and i'm starting to think you don't like me anymore .
no , i'm kidding .
hey , guys .
but i am getting a little worried , so gimme a call when you get a chance , okay?
barry says " hi .
so gimme a call as soon as you can , okay?
i miss you .
call me , okay?
bye .
what's up , guys?
not much .
you?
nothing .
i was just finishing my tape to tiffany .
hey , mitch , what are you doin '?
are you hungry?
huh?
are you gonna feed him?
no , i'm checking the temperature inside his cage .
mitch needs an evenly distributed 85 degrees to survive .
can i drop a mouse in?
sorry .
mitch only eats once a week , on saturdays .
maybe we could cut a mouse in half , and we could feed him half now and the other half on saturday .
i don't think so .
i thought you had class now .
what time is it?
oh , shit !
can you do me a favor?
when this is done rewinding ,
will you drop it in the mail for me?
no problem .
just leave it there .
thanks , man .
i'll see you guys later?
bye .
can we please feed him now?
no .
if you overfeed him , he could die .
so?
it'll be worth it .
josh , hey .
beth , hey .
what's goin 'on?
not much .
where have you been?
nowhere .
just studying a lot .
i'm starting to question this whole college thing .
no one told me there was gonna be this much reading .
right .
yeah .
oh , you going to e. l. 's tonight?
yeah , i'll be there .
i gotta run .
class started five minutes ago .
i'll see you tonight .
yeah .
sorry .
tonight .
so , you have a thing for that guy now , is that it?
it's none of your business , jacob .
i can just tell you like him .
i'm not having this conversation again .
what conversation?
you need to stop this .
you and i , we're not a couple .
we've never been a couple , and we will never be one .
this week i'd like you ... to think about plato's dialogues of the middle years , i . e .
the republic , phaedo , symposium .
now , this will all be on next week's midterm , so ...
i suggest you read up on it .
ah , jacob , do you have anything to add?
just a reminder .
the midterm will cover all of the in class lectures ... as well as all of the assigned readings .
it will be entirely essay form , so bring legal pads .
i prefer yellow .
it's easier on the eyes .
okay .
okay?
yeah .
thank you, jacob .
and ... see you all next week for the midterm .
josh .
yes?
i saw you hitting on beth .
not a good idea .
she's spoken for .
what?
she'll come back to me .
they always do .
so , mr. parker .
do you intend to be ready for this exam?
yes , sir .
well , you better be ready .
because i was looking over the books last night , and you need a " b " on this test just to pass this class .
actually , i double checked that , professor .
he needs a " b " plus .
we're not gonna be able to bend on this .
yeah , i got it .
just copy off someone .
i can't .
it's all essays and stuff .
if i fail this class , my average is shot .
i might lose my financial aid .
i could not be allowed back next semester .
well , you're fucked then .
you might as well come to my party tonight .
hook up with beth , and at least enjoy your last week at college .
i'm not hooking up with anyone .
i made a commitment to tiffany .
i'm invested in this relationship .
invested?
who are you , charles schwab?
would you listen to yourself?
i would give my life ... for one evening of consensual sex with that girl .
i've gone this long without cheating .
i think i can hold out .
you're already cheating !
any time you pass up sex , you're cheating on yourself .
think about it .
you're in college .
the window of opportunity to drink and do drugs ... and take advantage of young girls is getting smaller by the day .
i gotta make a call .
i'm telling you .
you pass this up , it'll haunt you for the rest of your days .
your dick will never forgive you .
what do you think , little man?
don't you ever want to experience something new?
it ain't easy being josh's penis .
we've been here over two months , and i feel like i'm in a coma .
stop it .
i wish i was your dick , e. l. this is torture .
if something doesn't happen soon , i'm gonna pack up my balls and leave .
enough .
hello?
carla , it's josh .
i'm sorry to bother you .
is tiffany around?
tiffany is not here .
she didn't sleep here last night ... again .
and it would be great if one hour went by when you didn't call .
right .
if she wanted to talk to you , she'd call you .
deal with it .
what a bitch !
does she sound hot?
we've never gone this long without talking .
something is definitely wrong .
yeah , she found someone else like you should do .
the clock is ticking .
before you know it , you're gonna be 40 and have to pay for these kind a girls .
* she good looking got a mojo cooking *
* yeah , wouldn't give me the time of day *
* but if my occupation was a star in the constellation *
* we could get together in the milky way *
* and every body wanna know somebody *
* everyone wants to drop your name *
* you need no reservation no special invitation *
* no college education if you've got fortune and fame *
oh , yeah !
whoo hoo !
i should really warn you , though , it's been known ... to severely affect your decision making abilities and lowers your inhibitions .
good .
that's the plan .
no , that that's yes , that is the plan .
did you bring some cash?
why?
we've got chicks for sale .
what?
* hey , now i'm snappy got my mojo track **
trust me .
i've been goin 'to this school for seven years .
and i know the key to a well rounded college education ... is experimentation .
let me show you .
this is an auction .
remember ... you are not buying the girl , you are buying her company , and no way does a sale constitute sexual relations .
i know , i know .
believe me , i've tried .
anyway , without further ado , let's introduce you to our first ... person .
laura !
laura's from long island .
her favorite coloris blue .

you heard me .
i bid $30 loud and clear .
your bid didn't count .

good bye .
* on and on until the early morning *
* they're rockin 'on and on until the early morning * [ laughing ]
thanks for doing that .
i owe you one .

i think so .
yeah .
we're touching .
it's a lot of fun .
we're having a good time .
** [ romantic ]
who's tiffany henderson?
just some girl i used to date since i was like five .
but that's over now .
she blew me off .
oh , poor baby .
you must be very hurt .
do you need some special attention?
well , i am pretty upset .
did that help?
that helped a lot .
i have an idea .
what do you say?
i don't think so .
come on !
it'll be fun .
i've always wanted to try this .
no .
yes .
i'm gonna interview you .
fine .
okay .
okay , josh .
yes .
what do you look for in a girl?
well , let's see .
she should be smart and funny and
that's good too .
do you feel better yet?
i feel a little bit better .
yeah .
a little .
what else do you look for?
she should be attractive and ... nice and
topless .
and topless .
and she should kiss me .
what else?
she shouldn't stop kissing me .
why don't you keep doing that?
* tiny salmon swimming in a stream *
* tiny salmon chasing that impossible dream *
* the mynah bird says *
* the chimpanzee says * [ making monkey sounds ]

* and it's sad **
** [ humming ]
* good morning , everyone *
* good morning , everyone *
* how are you and you and you *
what are you so happy about?
i don't know .
do i seem happy this morning?
well , you're bouncing around here like you're richard fuckin 'simmons .
yeah , you do seem unusually light hearted today , josh .
huh .
maybe it's because i had the best time of my life last night .
twice !
and once this morning .
you and beth?
oh , yeah .
shut up .
what happened?
no way !
you're lying .
i'm not lying .
you can't make out with someone , then pretend you had sex with them .
that's really , really uncool .
i'm not pretending .
forget it .
i know you're lying .
i guarantee he's lying .
you wanna bet?
great .
i'm gonna bet money on something you can't prove .
you videotaped it !
no , no , no , i didn't !
gimme that !
gimme that !
e. l. , gimme that .
no way !
this is amazing !
i was kidding .
just give it back to me , okay?
gimme the tape .
huh?
come on , josh .
we're all gonna see it sooner or later .
huh?
he's got a point .
oh , no !
oh , no !
give it to me .
no , give it to me .
e. l , no .
josh , please?
we need this .
okay , listen , seriously .
you can never tell anyone you saw this .
oh , yeah .
okay .
okay !
barry , hit the lights .
it's boner time !
hey , tif .
it's me coming toyou live from lthaca , new york .
i thought i asked you to mail this yesterday .
yeah , it was on your desk .
i mailed it this morning .
barry , fast forward to the horny stuff .
* i got a girl * is this the kind of shit you've been sending tiffany?
oh , my god .
* it's you *
oh , fuck !
oh , my god !
no , no , no , no .
oh , god !
w wait a second .
tell me you mailed the beth tape to tiffany .
yes !
shit !
oh , no !
oh , no !
what?
hey , hey .
did you make a copy?
'cause if you made a copy , we could watch the copy .
don't answer it .
it's josh and rubin .
leave a message .
hi , josh .
it's tiffany .
sorry we haven't spoken .
listen , my grand father passed away .
i've tried calling you a few times , but no one picked up .
i didn't want to leave this message on your machine .
but by now you're probably a little worried , so
anyway , i'm at my parents 'house helping my mom out .
she's really a wreck .
if i don't speak with you , i'll call you monday when i'm back at school .
i'll be okay .
i just need some time .
bye .
i love you .
that's not fair .
how come she gets to see the tape and we don't?
she gets back there monday .
that leaves me three days to get there .
get where?
austin?
that's like 10, 000 miles from here .
eighteen hundred .
you wanna drive 1, 800 miles in three days?
just fly .
do you have money for a ticket?
i don't .
all right , so we're driving .
you're coming?
what else am i gonna do?
stay here and learn?
road trip .
just a minute .
hold on .
he's probably jackin 'off .
what do you guys want?
kyle , this is an emergency .
wait .
let me at least go back and call my dad .
call your dad?
would you listen to yourself?
you're 19 years old , and you're a fucking sissy .
all you ever do is sit in a library and play myst with exchange students .
it's pathetic .
no , no .
what he's trying to say is this is your chance to do something for once .
be a risk taker .
come with us .
you guys are just saying that because you want my car .
no !
no , we've always liked you .
or you can just give us the car .
that would make him a risk taker , right?
shut up , all right?
he's coming with us .
come on , kyle .
it'll be fun !
aren't you even curious where we're going?
no .
okay .
we're going to the university of austin .
sure you don't wanna come?
i don't like massachusetts .
austin's in texas , not massachusetts .
you're thinking of boston .
you've never left this town , have you , barry?
no , not really .
you should look into that .
that could turn into a debilitating phobia .
okay , i'll do that .
can i feed mitch?
yes , actually you can .
you can feed him .
but not till tomorrow .
there's a brown box full of mice next to his cage .
give him one tomorrow .
and no messing around , barry .
okay?
just one .
i'll feed him a mouse tomorrow , okay?
okay .
yeah .
you can count on me .
okay?
i'm reliable .
you guys do good .
have a good trip , safe trip , safe journey .
buckle up your seat belt .
i'm gonna feed the snake for you .
so off they went .
they had 1, 800miles to go , and only three days to do it .
it was a killer journey , and it was one that changed them forever .
the end .
so we're gonna go look over here now .
whoa , whoa , whoa .
that's it?
this story sucks .
that can't be the whole story .
what happened with the tape?
right .
the tape .
well , like i said , they were on a race against time .
* smokestack spitting black soot into the sunny sky *
* the load on the road brings a tear to the indian's eye *
since we didn't get to see the tape ,
can you at least describe it to us?
no .
* the elephant won't forget what it's like inside his cage *
* thering master's telling the cows the scene's on an empty stage *
admit that beth is amazing .
i admit it .
she's amazing .
she's perfect .
there you go .
i don't know why you feel so guilty .
technically you haven't cheated on tiffany .
what are you talking about?
there are these rules that guys have , an understanding as to what exactly constitutes cheating .
take your situation , for example .
it's not cheating .
it's never cheating ... when you're in a different area code , not to mention a different state .
that makes no sense .
don't look at me , kyle .
i didn't make up the rules .
this is legit .
i've actually read an article about this .
there's a whole bunch of them .
they're like loopholes .
right?
for argument's sake , let's say you were sleeping with two girls at the same time .
it wouldn't be cheating , because they would cancel each other out .
ahh .
exactly !
or if you're too wasted to remember?
it is not cheating .
because if you can't really remember it , it never really took place .
* uh huh *
* whoo oo *
i've got one .
are you ready?
it's not cheating if you spread peanut butter all over your testicles ... and let your dog lick it off .
because it's your dog !
jesus christ !
you know , because it's your dog !
yeah , we got it .
* whoo oo , uh huh *
* god damn right it's a beautiful day *
* uh huh god damn right **
somebody's gonna die tomorrow .
that's right .
one of you is marked for death .
and the first thing tomorrow morning , a chosen one will experience nature's wrath ... in all its fury .
* ah ah ah ah *
* ah ah ah ah *
who are you?
i'm beth .
are you here for the feeding?
excuse me?
you're early .
it's not till tomorrow .
you should come back .
it's gonna be a bloodbath .
i think i'll pass .
have you seen josh?
he went to visit his girl friend .
tiffany?
i thought they broke up .
i mean , this girl who's a friend of his .
you know what i mean .
where did he go?
austin?
austin , massachusetts?
you mean boston , massachusetts?
yeah , that's what i said .
boston .
the university of boston in massachusetts .
he is such an asshole .
i can't believe he just lied to my face like that .
i actually thought he liked me .
how could he do that?
wait , she was standing around topless?
girls don't stand around naked .
yeah , they do .
okay?
this is my story .
do you wanna hear it or not?
it just doesn't make any  shh .
please , no interruptions .
so this other girl walks up , totally hot .
naked !
really naked !
i know guys can be jerks .
i guess i just thought josh was different .
i liked him .
sweetie , listen to me .
they're all the same .
all men are perverted pigs .
all they think about , all they really care about , is sex .
you're so right .
you should go to boston and bust his ass .
right?
confront him and his little girl friend .
* i'm freakin 'you baby , drivin 'me crazy *
* i'm freakin 'you , baby drivin 'me crazy *
* i'm freakin 'you , baby drivin 'me crazy *
oh !
these too .
* i'm freakin 'you , baby drivin 'me crazy *
kyle , come here for a second .
look , we're a little short on cash right now , so we're gonna need to put this on your credit card .
we'll give you the cash when we get back .
i promise .
i can't .
it's my dad's .
it's for emergencies only .
hello !
this is an emergency .
we need this stuff .
you want us to sleep in the dirt?
* i'm freakin 'you , baby drivin 'me crazy *
* when i get to your place *
* i wanna turn up the highs and turn up the bass **
well , i'd say we're officially in no man's land .
we've been on this road for over an hour .
this is gonna save us five hours minimum .
so thank me later , josh , okay?
maybe we should turn around and go back to the interstate .
we're not goin 'back .
we're not goin 'back .
have some faith , kyle .
it's supposed to be a challenge .
that's why they call it a shortcut .
if it was easy , it would just be the way .
damn it !
fuck !
yep , i give us about 20 minutes before our first ass raping .
what do we do now?
if we turn around , we're gonna lose five hours back tracking .
turn around?
why?
because of this?
we can make it .
make it?
you mean jump it?
no .
absolutely not .
no way .
we're going back .
it can be done .
this incline is 30 degrees roughly , right?
factory weight of the car is 1, 600 .
add our weight plus cargo , 2, 100 pounds .
no , no .
if we hit this at 50 miles per hour , our trajectory will clear ten feet , easy .
no way .
absolutely not .
kyle , we'll go 60 just to be certain .
we're goin 'back .
this is impossible .
you sure?
of course i'm sure .
with physics i'm always sure .
yes .
i'm driving .
i don't think you guys heard me .
this is my car , and we're not gonna be jumping over any rivers .
kyle , it's ten feet .
bob hope could jump this in a golf cart .
look , i can spit across this gap .
yeah .
well , better make it 75 .
okay .
let's do it .
trust me , kyle , it's science .
no , you guys .
no .
e. l. , get out of my car .
kyle , in the car .
come on .
we're okay .
you know we need to hit 60 , right?
i'm trying .
this car sucks .
stop !
thank you !
yes !
what did i tell you?
oh , my god .
oh , my god !
my father is gonna kill me when he finds out about this .
i only said we'd make it across .
i never said anything about the wheels staying on .
what the hell are we gonna do now?
i'm totally screwed !
i don't have time to be walking through the woods right now .
josh , we're gonna call a tow truck .
we'll have the axles fixed .
we'll probably lose halfa day .
it'll be fine .
it's just the wheels !
the minute i think i feel something for someone , they just turn around and screw me over .
just something about josh .
he's just different .
i feel like we had a connection .
i don't think i'll ever be able to trust a guy .
you shouldn't !
honey , the last time i trusted a man was 1 985 , and he took off with my sister and my van .
it was a regular size van .
that was before they started making that minivan crap .
so there's no hope , huh?
oh , there's hope .
but it comes with batteries .
you can keep that .
god .
crap .
listen , guys , we're gonna have to be more careful .
we almost died in that explosion .
i wish i had died .
i'm serious .
i can't die young .
something tells me the people of earth are gonna need me .
i must live .
yeah , right .
we all must live .
before we do that , we must figure out how to get back on the road .
we shouldn't be going to sleep right now .
let's lay an indication here and there of some little shadow areas .
excuse me .
i'm sorry , do you need to get that?
do you need something?
yeah .
this is sort of an unusual question .
but do you have any marijuana i might be able to buy from you?
our car exploded last night , and i'm practically out of my own .
am i a drug dealer?
no , i am not .
thank you for asking though .
no?
okay , that's okay .
thanks .
is there anything else i can help you with?
perhaps you'd like an 11 year old prostitute sent to your room .
we can do that .
or maybe we can off someone for you .
huh?
how's that sound?
i've got it .
why don't we start small?
would you like a fresh towel?
maybe you could roll that up and smoke it .
dick .
by the way , cheech .
that credit card you guys gave me last night was maxed out .
so don't go spending all your cash on needles and guns just yet .
um , mr. earl edwards?
i'm sorry , sir .
this card's over its limit .
that's not true .
put it through your little machine again .
i ran it through three times , sir .
it keeps telling me you're over your limit .
if you have another card , i'd be happy to  don't give me any attitude .
you go fix that little toy back there , and charge this friggin 'meal to that friggin 'card .
we've been coming here for 20 years .
we've only been open eight years , sir .
do it now .
relax , it's not that big a deal .

no one forced you to come along , man .
first off , we're making great time .
second , if tiffany did see that tape , it'd be the best thing ever happened to you .
what is that supposed to mean?
beth is like an angel .
she's here to help you change your life .

i think not .
it's a sign , josh .

oh .
oh , my god .
i'm okay .
it's just i'm in kind of a bind .
all my notes and books were destroyed .
i was wondering if it was possible to get a little extension .
maybe take the midterm a couple days later .
oh , sure .
yes , it sounds like an emergency .
how about an extra three days?
how would that sound?
would that work?
yeah , that would be fantastic .

just glad you're not hurt .
i'm marking it down right now .
that is so great , professor .

the window of opportunity to go out and have fun and meet new people ... is getting smaller by the day .
it is?
come on , josh .
we've been together forever .
i mean ... you're pretty much the only guy i've ever been with .
what do you mean , " pretty much the only guy "?
well , i was 14 , and you were away at camp .
