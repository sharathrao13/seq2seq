i was lucky .
i came from the most beautiful place on earth ... ... where music was everywhere .
and people believed there was no difference ... ... between being awake and dreaming .
my dream was always clear .
for as long as i could remember , i wanted to be a musician .
that's my mother .
she's the one who taught me how to sing .
that's me .
whenever i heard her voice , all i wanted was to be held in her arms ... ... so i could be closer to the source of the magic .
when my mother suddenly died ... ... i felt like everything around me had died too .
i couldn't feel anything anymore .
the only thing that kept me going were the letters from uncle alfonso .
he'd gone to los angeles and made it big in the restaurant business .
he said the streets really were paved with gold if you worked hard enough .
i didn't know what to do , so i asked my grandfather , a very wise man ... ... what he thought .
and he told me that all of life is a dream ... ... and i should choose my dreams carefully ... ... because they're very powerful things .
los angeles , city of angels .
and my future?
well , yet to unfold .
who would've thought i'd end up like this?
it turned out that uncle alfonso wasn't the taco king of l. a.
he didn't even own the place .
but he was the assistant manager and he did get me this job ... ... so i shouldn't complain , but i can't take those hats .
here she comes .
okay .
hi .
hello .
what can i do for you?
i'll have a happy burrito combo with extra cheese .
that's nina , the love of my life .
and she doesn't even know that i exist .
okay .
happy burrito with extra cheese .
to go .
to go .
absolutely .
hi there , baby doll ... ... angel ... ... precious ... ... beautiful pussycat .
when you look at me ... ... you kill me .
you make me chase my tail in circles .
okay , that's going to be 3 . 75 .
and i'm really sorry about him .
yeah , whatever .
that's 3 ... ... and that's 4 .
there you go .
have a beautiful day .
thank you .
you'll be back , pussycat .
i know it .
don't bet on it , taco boy .
dude , you suck .
you know that women don't like your macho comments .
what they appreciate is to be spoken to with respect .
respeto , that's what it's all about , chivo .
what you talking about?
she was hot .
didn't you see that?
i'll show some respeto .
i'll be like , " call me taco boy !
call me taco boy !
it's amazing what depths a person will sink to when they get desperate .
but as long as i could play my music , i didn't care .
most people have forgotten about the dreams that brought them here .
but then again , so have i.
well , thank you .
thank you very much .
this next song is " lonely girl .
and remember , the more you drink , the better i sound .
thank you .
clean this up .
thank you very much .
we're gonna take a short break ... ... and i'll be right back , so please don't go away .
thank you .
julin .
juan .
come here .
give me a hand with the stuff .
hey .
wake up .
okay .
you guys ... ... are so losing your game boy ... ... as soon as i get this in the house .
gonna give me a hand?
i'll give you a hand .
no , i got it .
i got it .
please , let me help you .
it's okay .
do you play?
yeah .
and where do you live?
i live next door .
well , i hope you're not planning on making too much noise , okay?
wait , wait .
let's do this right .
my name's antonio .
hi .
what's your name?
mirabela .
let's get started .
okay , and just this one .
i can get the rest .
just this one will be good .
hi .
i just wanted to say to you that ... ... that i'm really sorry about my co worker's behaviour the other day .
he's just not ....
he's not very smart sometimes .
you're the guy from the taco place .
yeah .
i'm antonio .
i'm nina .
how are you?
look , i wanted to ask you ... ... i don't know if you wanted to go to dinner or dancing this friday ... ... i was wondering if you were available to do me the honour?
is that a date you're asking for?
i think so .
i'm flattered , but i will have to say no .
because i have to work on friday .
okay .
i'm sorry .
maybe some other time .
okay .
hey .
i'm gonna be there anyway , friday night at la zona rosa ... ... if you ....
if you change your mind or ....
okay .
bye .
thank you .
who was that?
i don't know .
just some guy .
what's up , uncle?
antonio , look around this place .
it doesn't take all these people to roll a burrito .
we have way too many workers .
we're gonna have to let someone go .
since you were the last one hired ... ... l guess you have to be the first one fired .
i can't do anything about it .
it's corporate .
but i'm family !
i'm your blood !
i'm really sorry .
here .
here's a week's pay .
take it !
take it !
it'll hold you over ... ... for a while at least , until you find something else .
you'll be okay , tonio .
you're young , you're strong .
you'll be okay , eh?
sure .
thanks for everything , uncle .
i don't know , maybe i'll go back to mexico .
you know , i would if i could ... ... but i can't because i'm a total failure .
yeah , it's a setback .
so what?
yeah , but nobody wants to hear my music .
girls don't wanna be with a broke musician .
i don't know .
i'm scrawny , i'm short .
don't let nobody tell you about what people wanna hear .
people get tired of being sold the same old thing over and over again .
after a while , they look for something real .
you think?
yeah , that's why i took this npr job .
oh , the npr job , right .
because that pays the big dollars .
i don't know .
maybe you should enter that contest .
what contest?
what contest?
it's only the largest latino band competition this side of tijuana .
how come i haven't heard about it?
i don't know .
the winner gets to open a concert for a world famous mystery musician .
you know what the top money is?
the top band wins 10, 000 .
ten thousand dollars?
wow .
ten thousand dollars .
hey !
antonio !
hey .
keep the noise down .
antonio !
jeez .
i'm sorry .
i'm sorry .
if you're gonna play music ... ... then play music .
you might wanna hear something from my collection .
you have a collection?
i gotta see this .
let me just see what you have .
the oldies .
that's the good stuff .
you don't have to tell me that .
come on .
come inside , we'll play them together .
no , thanks , i've heard them .
i gotta get back to my card game .
oh , yeah?
what are you playing?
solitaire .
solitaire?
oh , come on , by yourself?
come over here , we'll play the songs .
jos jos .
you know , my father used to play with him .
and he told me some gossip .
he said that jos jos's father ... ... only wanted classical music in the house ... ... because he was an operatic singer ... ... and forbade him to play that pop .
well ...
i want to see that . ... let's see if you know who this is .
do you know?
okay , i don't wanna see it .
i know how to do this , thank you .
i know that .
that's paquita la del barrio .
also known as francisca viveros barradas .
the defender of women against el macho .
she's from my hometown .
oh , is she?
yeah .
she sings about getting dumped .
i can relate .
do you know who this is?
perfidia .
perfidia .
who?
that's alberto dominguez , and his xavier cugat version .
when they told xavier cugat that his music ... ... was too much middle of the road ... ... he said , " well , i'd rather play 'chiquita banana '... ... and have a swimming pool than play bach and starve .
he said that?
yes , he did .
how come you know so much?
because i'm a geek , that's why .
what are you doing?
what are you talking about?
you're just incredible , the way you sing .
it made the hair on my arm stand up , look at that .
you should be singing all the time .
no , i'm too old .
yeah , okay?
i used to sing .
but that was a long time ago .
with my ex , javier .
back in veracruz , we had some really good times .
and then he came here , he met some pocha pop tart ...
... and dumped me .
you know what ... ... forget the loss , you know , just be happy that it happened .
yeah .
well , i've stayed too long .
i gotta get back to my kids .
enjoy the records .
and don't play them too loud .
okay .

he looks super busy to me .
what are you talking about?
he looks like a nice guy .
i don't think he's into her .
i'm very sorry .
he's breaking his neck to get over here .
excuse me .
excuse me .
may i have this dance with you?

no , no .
no , don't look .
it's worth the wait .
you'll see .
almost there .
okay , here we are .
all right , you ready?
it looks so small .
nothing like it feels .
you know , sometimes when i just feel like ... ... the whole city's gonna swallow me up ... ... and i don't want to crawl on all fours anymore ... ... i come up here and i feel ....
i feel like anything can happen up here .
i don't know , like i can lick the stars .
i can , i don't know , suck the moon .
i could be president .
oh , god , i'm weird , right?
what do you wish?
i wish that ... ... my mother was still alive .
one day ... ... i told her that ... ... i would be the first one in the family to be a doctor .
a veterinarian .
and i'll never forget ...
paloma ... ... you're gonna be the best ... ... veterinarian in the world .
and you are .
you're going to be .
i know it .
i feel it .

because she's gone now .
i know , i know .

i'm sorry .
i'm sorry .
i don't know , i couldn't help myself , i ....
what?
come here .
come on , pap .
i'll help you into bed .
pap?
yes , doctor .
hold on one moment , please .
hi , miss acosta?
yes .
i'm dr. lopez .
hi .
i'm happy to say that your father's gonna be fine .
thank you , doctor .
he had a stroke , but it was only a minor one .
he's gonna need some extra care for a while , but he's gonna fully recover .
can i see him now?
yeah , sure .
thank you .
this way .
stop .
i just don't know ... ... why he left his children .
that i'll never understand .
all right , all right .
you call child welfare ... ... and you report him .
that is what you do .
i can't .
you are not over him , are you?
i am so completely over that pig of a man .
you know what i'm gonna do?
i am gonna do a psychic reading .
oh , god , no .
yes , and you're gonna love it .
that's what you need right now .
and are you ready?
no .
here we go .
there's a man nearby .
it's giving me three clues .
what do you mean , clues?
well , so that you'll recognize him when you meet him .
first , he will be a great lover of music .
oh , that's nice .
second , he will cherish the colour red .
he will serve you ... ... the greatest meal you have ever had .
so fabulous that you will scream with joy .
or it might be the other way around where you're serving him the meal .
i don't know .
but either way , there's food involved , for sure .
when do i meet him?
i don't know .
pap , i was so scared .
nina .
nina .
i thought i was gonna lose you too .
why did you even worry?
you know i wouldn't leave you .
not yet , anyway .
you know , nina ... ... i died for a minute , and guess what .
i saw mam .
really?
how is she?
oh , she is doing great .
beautiful as ever .
and you know what else?
she says she will wait for me until it's my time to cross over .
and she will have a big plate of my favourite spicy tamales ... ... just for me , so i can smell my way to the other side .
that's sweet , pap .
just as long as you're not planning on having those tamales too soon .
mam told me it is not my time yet .
no , it was amazing .
he actually talked to his dead wife .
no , it was amazing .
he actually talked to his dead wife .
well , what was that ...?
how did he end up ...?
what was the communication between them?
it was tamales .
tamales?
yeah .
imagine that .
now , let's go .
here we are .
they're great , huh?
nobody knows who they are yet .
but they're on their way up .
that's pancho on the guitar , enrique on the bass ... ... and jos on the drums .
hey , raj .
raj , can i ask you something?
how long you been together with your girlfriend?
my fiance .
and i've known her for about three years .
three years , huh?
raj?
yep .
how did you know that she was the one?
first time i saw her , i knew .
you knew .
and did she know too?
are you kidding?
i had to chase her around like some crazy fool .
but you know what they say , when a man knows , he knows .
it's black and white for us men , no grey stuff in between .
right .
that's right .
raj .
last question .
how did you hook her?
i mean , how did you win her over?
what did you do?
well , i never gave up , but i didn't crowd her either .
i bought her a lot of beautiful gifts .
and most importantly , i made her confident i'd be able to provide for her .
women wanna know that a guy can take care of her ... ... a guy that can really bring home the bacon .
i say this even though i'm a vegetarian .
well , thank you .
you're welcome .
okay , okay .
look , i hope i'm not bothering you .
look , i just want to give you these flowers , that's all .
nothing more .
no , really .
she wouldn't believe that .
dr. lopez will be here soon to check up on you , pap .
thank you , mija .
here , let me close the curtains so you can watch your show better .
no , mija , that's okay .
i like them open .
look , i'm not stalking you .
no , why would l?
see?
it's better like this .
fuck !
stop !
what?
what was that all about?
what was what all about?
you .
i mean , come on .
the band is not all about you and your guitar .
i know that , it's just we're playing with old amps .
yeah?
you have to open them wide up or else it doesn't sound good .
you should know this .
all right .
all right .
can we just break it down a little bit so i could hear myself?
one , two .
one , two , three , four .
okay .
wait , wait .
pancho !
pancho !
pancho , i thought you told me you were cool with this setup .
you told me you were not the lead vocalist type .
i never said that , man .
okay .
look ....
look , we came here together for the contest , all right?
and exposure is something ... ... that each and every one of you needs right now .
so let's drop the egos ... ... and let's get out of the way of the music , okay?
i don't know what's wrong with me , man .
i'm sorry , man .
i don't know what happened to me .
i don't know what's wrong with me .
we never had any trouble before that guy came in .
you know what i mean?
i think he plays good .
well , yeah , i mean , the guy can play .
but he ....
he doesn't have the mojo that we need for the band , you know?
yeah .
look , guys , just go with me on this one , all right?
we're gonna win the $10, 000  thank you .
i got it .
we're gonna win the $10, 000 .
we'll open for the mystery musician .
we'll win the whole thing .
you just gotta trust me on this .
i just want to play .
we all want to play .
let's do it .
come on .
hi .
i came to see how the two of you are .
i left so many messages .
hi .
i know .
i'm sorry .
i haven't been able to return your calls .
it's ....
i've been really busy with pap .
that's not what i meant .
i mean , that's why i came by , because i wanted to help you .
well , there's nothing that you can really do .
i just have to be here .
that's why he got in trouble in the first place ... ... because i wasn't here for him .
but now is when you really need your friends , right?
i brought you something .
no , i can't take it .
please , please .
i want you to have it .
i can't .
i can't be with you , antonio .
why?
i just can't .
please understand .
don't make it harder on me .
nina ... ... i'm here for you .
x marks the place .

tonio .

like , three days right before the tryouts !
i know .
tonio .
tonio .
come on .
i'll buy you one .
you know you know why?
because he thinks he's better than me .
he thinks because he went to the right schools ... ... he came from a better neighbourhood ....
listen .
i hear you .
thank you .
thank you for giving me that .
but it's true .
he always ....
always has all those airs .
you guys have any requests?

you have anything original?

i always want something original .
javier , you wanted me to sign the papers , i signed them .
that's what you wanted , that's what you got .
just leave me alone .
no way .
but , javier , look ... ... don't forget to be a father to our babies , huh?
they need that .
you just can't drop them too .
you can't divorce your children .
very good .
antonio .
where have you been?
for you .
they're red .
yes .
i just wanted to thank you for reminding me ... ... that my world is music .
antonio , i ....
i don't deserve this .
what , are you kidding?
don't ever say that .
you're wonderful .
don't doubt yourself .
here .
come in .
oh , no , i can't .
i gotta ....
i gotta go down to los lobos and meet my new band .

i feel like a queen .

who is she , anyway?

so is it hard being in a band?

i usually do it in front of my family and friends ... ... but i guess there's a first time for everything .

you don't want to jinx it .
no .
no .
thank you .
thank you .

good for him .
what , you don't care?
nope .

make sure you don't spill .

beatriz .
beatriz?

zorro , i don't know , i don't know .
nina's driving me crazy .
my mind's on fire .
i don't know what to do .
you'll be fine .
hi .
hey .
are you antonio hernandez?
yeah .
that's me .
what can i do for you?
we're from estrella arts management .
yeah?
we'd like to talk about your career .
we saw you play at the tryouts .
we think you've got potential .
well , thank you .
that's very nice of you to say .
there's a great deal of talk lately from the major record labels ... ... about recruiting a fresh , new latin talent .
a solo act to be the next big crossover .
but i'm not a solo act .
with our help , you could be huge .
playing mainstream songs in english .
i don't know , maybe you have the wrong guy .
maybe less ruffles .
okay .
i'll be right back .
will you start on the hem , hon?
of course .
you really do look gorgeous , you know?
it would look a lot better on you .
no way .
i'm too skinny .
look at me .
i wish i could have some nice curves like you do .
i'm a stick .
why do we worry about our bodies all the time?
we're never satisfied , are we?
yeah , and it's usually just to please a man .
i've decided that i don't need a man .
but there is ... ... someone that you're crazy about , isn't there?
why do you say that?
i saw you and antonio at the party .
i'm not ready to get serious with anyone .
do you love him?
i don't know .
he loves you .
really?
oh , i'm sure of it .
so , what we're offering is to manage you ...
... and set you up as a solo act .
i know .
i understand that .
but i already have a manager .
look , i know your manager , and he's a really nice guy ... ... but he hasn't been in the game for years .
he just can't do for you what we can .
you know , antonio , sometimes you just have to forget about the past .
this is a fast paced industry .
if you don't grab your chance when it comes around , you get left behind .
forgotten .
yesterday's news .
i mean , to be honest with you ... ... it has always been my dream to just make an album .
i just want to have a cd , that's all .
well , better yet , how about a record deal?
you really think so?
you don't think it's too late?
i still have a chance?
we wouldn't be here if we didn't .
well , look , i really gotta think it over .
sure .
but don't take too long .
this one is on us .
i got it .
thank you .
i'll take it over there for you .
well , thank you for coming .
okay .
sorry my hands are dirty .
it's okay .
i mean , they're not dirty , they're just greasy .
i'll be in touch , okay?
okay .
thanks .
thank you .
here you go .
this should be it .
what's up?
so you got a record deal , huh?
maybe .
well , good for you , man .
hey !
zorro , i'm so glad you're here .
i need to talk to you .
can we talk later?
we're late .
please , i gotta talk to you .
if you were me ... ... and all of a sudden you had opportunities you worked so hard for
opportunities?
when we're done ... ... you'll have more than you ever know .
no , i know , but listen to me .
if you had to then make a choice between two things ...
... that you really wanted  listen .
let me tell you something .
this is the reason i became a manager to begin with ... ... to bring beautiful music to the world .
we're gonna bring boleros back to life .
i'm excited about this .
are you excited?
yes .
of course .
come on .
let's go inside .
come on .
let's go .
okay .
i had a sofa made out of this material .
you look wonderful .
i don't look like i'm going to a funeral?
no .
you look very handsome .
thank you .
don't spill on your jackets .
no .
oh , my goodness , she looks beautiful .
you look great !
we're back with pancho from all star gringo star .
so are you excited about the finals?
do you think you got a good chance?
yeah , i think we do have a really good chance .
now you told me earlier ... ... that the contest has generated so much publicity ... ... that there's talk of record industry interest .
yeah , yeah .
well , not for us , unfortunately , just yet .
but i did hear that the lead singer from el gran colectivo ... ... is signing up with a new manager ... ... and is going solo right after the contest , so ....
imagine that .
so he'll be going out on his own?
yes , the best of luck for him .
i'm sure your band will stay together ... ... and you guys are gonna do just fantastic , pancho .
you are too kind .
thank you very much .
antonio , we need to talk to you .
what is this we hear in the news ... ... that you have a new deal with a new manager?
and that you're going solo?
how could you do that to zorro and mirabela?
how could you do that to us?
i thought what we had was good .
i'm really sorry .
i should've told you what was going on .
yeah , what's going on?
i feel really bad .
you know
because i keep things inside , and i should say what i'm feeling
oh , please .
so it's true .
no , mirabela , wait .
i did get the offer .
and let me tell you , it was really tempting , but
antonio , we'd be happy for you .
just don't do it behind our backs .
i turned it down .
because because we're better all together .
our music is all of us .
are you sure?
of course i'm sure .
because i don't have a big office downtown .
who cares about a big office downtown?
those big office people never believed in me like you did .
you're gonna bring the bolero back to the people "?
what happened to that?
okay .
all right .
all right .
hi .
hey .
how are you?
guess what .
what?
i'm going to vet school .
that's great .
i'm so happy for you .
that's everything you wanted , right?
it's great .
i wanted to say i'm sorry .
sorry for what?
i think i've been really stupid .
no , no , you had a lot going on .
you couldn't help but be stupid .
i'm just kidding .
i mean , what's important right now ... ... is that you become everything your mother said you should become .
but ... ... what about us?
what about us?
you think that ... ... maybe we can ... ... start again where we left off?
but why?
i mean , i don't know how you feel about me .
yes , you do .
no , i don't .
yes , you do .
you're gonna go off to vet school ... ... find some vet and do some animal experiments .
dissect animals and ....
thank you for shutting me up .
i want you , antonio .
really?
my name is marco mendez from super estrella ... ... and welcome to the mystery musician contest .
tonight , one lucky band is gonna be named the winner ... ... and will open for the mystery musician next week .
but that's not all .
because that band ... ... is gonna walk off with $10, 000 cash today .
zo !
so ... ... how's everybody feeling?
have you seen how many people are out there?
we've never competed before .
three hundred people .
they got nothing on you .
nothing .
i'm not gonna lie to you , this is a big night .
but all those people out there ... ... they're your friends , they're your family , they're your supporters ... ... they're on your side .
this isn't about competition .
you gotta forget about competing .
this is about doing what it is that you do .
and what is it that you do?
you play .
right .
yeah .
that's right .
and you know what?
you've gotta love what you do .
they'll feel that .
i swear .
trust me .
all right , give it up for zo !
okay .
one , two , three , four .
can i talk to you for a minute?
what's up?
i wanted to know , why did you do that to me on the radio?
look , man , i ....
this whole thing just got out of hand .
i'm sorry .
it's ....
i guess i wanted it all .
maybe i was expecting too much , i don't know .
yeah , well , don't expect too much and you won't regret too much .
okay , now give it up for all star gringo star .
come on .
one , two , three , four .
i'm just gonna take a little peek at the crowd .
oh , no , no , no .
don't you dare .
don't let the crowd psych you out .
mirabela .
javier .
that bastard .
she's so ... ... young .
so ... ... skinny .
i can't .
you know what?
i can't .
why?
why?
what's the matter?
i can't do it , okay?
why not?
no , you sing the song .
i told you not to let the crowd get to you , didn't l?
it's my ex .
he's out there ...
... and he's with her .
okay .
okay , mirabela , you're not gonna give up everything ...
... because of one dumb guy , are you?

a loser .
yeah .
a loser .
a real loser .
if he did not know what a good thing he had when he was with you ... ... then he'll never find out .
that's right .
get up on that stage and show him what you're made of .
mirabela?
i don't say much ... ... but you were born for this moment .

i just want everyone to be ready for whatever happens ... ... because this is gonna be very , very close .
okay , guys .
okay .
let's just ....
we've come this far , what if we don't win?
it doesn't matter .
we have the most important thing , right?
we have each other .
so come on , let's toast to the winners .
to the winners .
to the winners .
you're right .
