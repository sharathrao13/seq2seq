sean .
look we're friends , so i'm gonna tell you face to face .
i don't give a damn if you are time's man of the year .
after last night's bloodbath , i'm terminating your war on terrorists .

the assignment was to enter a federal prison as castor troy .
it's just fucking insane .
and it's a special ops surgeon , uh , gave me , uh ,
castor's face !
then , uh and then , somehow , castor came out of his , uh , his his coma , and he killed everybody ... who knew about the mission .
but , but not before transforming into me .

i'm moving very slowly .
i was thinking the other day , i
i remember ...
i once took a date out ... for surf and turf , not knowing she was a vegetarian .
so she ate bread .
and , uh , and broke her tooth on a rye seed .
and we , we drove around all night , uh , looking for a for a all night dentist .
and , and he , uh he was so drunk , he fixed the wrong tooth .
and it when i finally brought her home
even though it must have hurt like hell , you , you , you kissed me .
sean , that man
you know we've been living together as man and wife for a week .
yeah , i
i know .
eve .
eve .
i put you in that position and , and
i i i can never make it up to you .
well , you're damn well gonna try .
let me take a look at that wound before you bleed to death .
with lazarro out of the way ,
castor's the new acting director of the bureau .
he's untouchable .
not tomorrow .
tomorrow he'll be at victor's service .
tomorrow .
that will be the day .
i want you and jamie away from there .
give him a good excuse .
i can cover for jamie , but if i'm not coming he's gonna know that something's up .
and besides , i'm the only one who can try and explain the truth .
excuse me , mr archer .
may i help you?
dr levine to x ray .
sean , what are you doing here?
sorry , darling , it
i just get so , so jealous , i
i mean , wh wh what is a guy to think when his , uh , his wife runs off in the middle of the night?
that i'm a doctor that's on call , so please let me get back to work , okay?
sorry .
lies , distrust , mixed messages .
this is turning into a real marriage .
how's adam?
i took him over to my cousin's until this whole thing blows over .
where's jamie?
that's what i'd like to know .
she stole $50 from my purse and took off .
so what's the next move?
this isn't your fight .

this is , um , adam .
and he needs a place to live .
hi .
my name's jamie .
i'm adam .
why don't you show adam his new room?
come on .
okay .
you shot your mouth off like a kid
who's scared to have a heart
losing grip of what really matters
'cause you don't know where to start
you wake up in the morning
with a starfuck for a friend
the things you do are so in tune
with what you said you hate
what's giving you the will to live
is looking for revenge
the only laugh that you got left
is hiding from the pain
what must have happened to your soul
is skinning you alive
the thing you fear the most is love
and that's very deep inside
yeah
so deep inside
don't lose your head
'cause i can't do the time
don't lose your head
or can you pay the price
the heart you're building out of rock
is turning into sand
'cause you never took the time to think
what it means to be a man
you act like you got the answer
when the question's never asked
i've been to where you're coming from
but the postcards weren't so bad
the knife i carry has been sharpened
on the mouths that won't keep shut
i'd stab at you in the darkness
to try to shed some light
your point of view's so meaningless
if you ever had one at all
well , all you seem to care about
is who's gonna take the fall
who's gonna take the fall for you
don't lose your head
now i can't do the time for you
don't lose your head
now can you pay the price
yeah
are you unworthy
don't lose your head
'cause i can't do the time oh , yeah
don't lose your head
well , can you pay the price
don't lose your head
'cause i can't do the time oh , yeah
don't lose your head all right
well , can you pay the price
don't lose your head
if you can't do the time
no , don't lose your head
if you can't pay the price
don't lose your head if you can't pay the price
don't lose your head
you know i can't do the time
yeah you ain't worth it to me
don't lose your head you ain't worth it to me
