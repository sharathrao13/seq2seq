chlna 859 a. d.
after 241 years of prosperity , the tang dynasty is in decline .
the emperor is weak and incompetent .
his government , crippled by corruption , no longer controls the land .
unrest sweeps the country .
village by village , an underground alliance forms ...
'the house of flying daggers '.
based in feng tian county , near the lmperial capital ,
the house of flying daggers moves in the shadows ,
stealing from the rich to give to the poor , they earn the support and admiration of the people .
at the same time , they are feared and hated by their bitter rivals ... the local deputies ,
captain leo , captain jin .
we're heading out on patrol .
we're going to be busy again .
the provincial office has given us ten days to catch the new leader of the 'flying daggers '.
what?
it took us three months to assassinate their old leader .
ten days?
impossible .
have you heard of the new peony pavilion?
yes .
does anyone know you there?
no , i haven't been there yet .
good , now's your chance .
any information?
we suspect one of the showgirls is a member of the 'flying daggers '.
ok , i'll check it out .
pull .
pull harder .
pull harder .
that's it .
i'm done .
madam !
i'm coming .
madam .
here i am .
what can i do for you , sir?
i heard you have a new girl .
you're well informed .
is she pretty?
she's quite a beauty .
bring her to me .
there is one thing you need to know .
what's that?
the girl is blind .
blind?
then she must be special .
i'm curious .
how did you lose your sight?
i was born blind .
why would a blind girl work here?
why can't a blind girl work here?
you're right .
what's your name?
mei .
mei?
every girl here is named after a flower .
why is yours so plain?
i don't want to compete with those girls .
what do you mean?
the flowers here can hardly be called flowers .
real flowers bloom in the wilderness .
well said .
if you impress me
i'll take you to where the real flowers grow .
what's your talent as the top showgirl?
dancing .
come closer .
don't you know the rules?
a rare beauty in the north .
she's the finest lady on earth .
a glance from her , the whole city goes down .
a second glance leaves the nation in ruins .
there exists no city or nation that has been more cherished than a beauty like this .

there exists no city or nation that has been more cherished than a beauty like this .
please calm down , sir .
go away .
what's the matter?
please let me explain .
this girl is young and inexperienced .
please forgive her .
take her away .
go away .
take her away .
stop !
captain .
this is the captain of the county .
to hell with the captain !
outrageous !
arrest him .
let me go .
who are you?
how dare you !
i'm the captain .
you're drunk and indecently dressed .
arrest both of them .
get your hands off me .
let me go .
please spare the girl , captain .
that man was drunk .
it was not her fault .
please don't arrest her .
our business is new .
i rely on her to bring in guests .
how can a blind girl be a top showgirl?
move !
she's a dancer with rare skills .
please see for yourself .
do you know the 'echo game '?
i played it once ...
all right .
perform well and i'll let you go .
thank you , captain .
go and change quickly .
fantastic .
excellent !
who are you , really?
why do you want to kill me?
government running dogs ...
i wish to kill all of you !
i do enjoy fighting a blind girl .
we found this in her room .
you're a member of the 'flying daggers '.
who's the new leader?
where's the new leader?
i'll show you what we'll do if you don't answer .
show her !
in front of you is a torture device .
your head will be put here .
your shoulder , here .
your back , here .
your legs , here .
you'll never dance again after this .
do you understand?
you have one day to think it over .
this girl reminds me of someone .
who?
rumor has it , the old leader's blind daughter disappeared after his death .
it was a heavy blow to the 'flying daggers '.
they vowed revenge for their loss , while searching for the girl .
why would the old leader's daughter end up in a brothel?
who owns the peony pavilion?
perhaps the 'flying daggers 'has realized we were responsible for their old leader's death .
forget it .
let's turn her over for a reward , and then go out for a drink .
i have a better idea .
since we have some clues ,
iet's follow them through for a bigger reward .
do you want me to do it?
of course , who else?
all right .
this girl is a rare beauty .
you know i love flirting with girls .
don't let beauty blind your judgment .
if i die under a skirt , i can still flirt as a ghost .
who are you?
i undressed you only yesterday .
have you forgotten me already?
why did you rescue me?
why do you think?
you're an exquisite flower .
i'll do anything to help you .
control yourself .
don't worry .
i'm no longer a guest of the peony pavilion .
you're not a showgirl anymore .
you're the daughter of the old leader .
what did you say?
how many blind girls know martial arts and carry daggers like these?
i've rescued you , and your daggers as well .
why did you take such a risk?
i hate the corrupt government and admire the 'flying daggers '.
much obliged .
why did we abandon the horses?
hoof prints can be easily tracked .
i have two new horses hidden ahead .
you've planned well .
what's your name , master?
just call me wind .
wind?
i wander around all alone , come and go without a trace .
like a carefree wind?
no , a playful wind .
you like to tease .
i wonder what you look like?
that's easy to find out .
here .
please let go .
this isn't the peony pavilion .
no rules here .
you'll know what i look like if you touch my face .
come on .
it's not respectful to touch your face first .
you prefer to start at the bottom .
that's fine with me .
you've mastered the flying technique .
your right hand is skilled with a machete .
your left hand is powerful with a bow and arrow .
your heart beats steadily , you seem sincere .
you can read me like a book .
you're a brave man .
i'm never shy around women .
you're young , indeed .
you know how to hold your drink .
the soldiers are approaching .
i've lost my dagger pouch .
i'm sorry i was late .
the 'flying daggers 'are always moving .
where should we go?
we just keep heading north .
just head north?
they will come to us .
the 'flying daggers 'has many masters .
why did they send you as an assassin?
no one sent me .
i came alone .
as the old leader's daughter , you should be more cautious .
have you considered the consequences?
i'll do anything to avenge my father .
come here .
these are men's clothes .
put them on for now .
i won't take advantage of you .
have you seen enough?
please hand me the clothes .
you knew i was here?
master wind wanders like the wind .
i'd expect you to be anywhere .
you look different in men's clothes .
do i look awful?
i will tell all the girls to wear men's clothes the next time i visit the peony pavilion .
now i know you're not shy around women .
you're not shy either .
how do you know?
you knew i was watching you bathe , yet you said nothing .
you saved my life .
you can look all you please .
i thought you were hot as fire .
in fact , you're cool as water .
i don't know you well enough .
i really care for you .
a playboy like you , are you ever for real?
what if i am this time?
are our men close by?
i'm sure today's fighting has fooled mei .
our men will ease off from now on .
good .
that'll save me some arrows .
any clues?
not yet .
don't let her see through you .
don't worry .
i never fail at seducing a woman .
she trusts me .
i warn you , don't fall for her .
what do you mean fall?
fall into bed?
like her father , she must be very cunning .
don't let her fool you .
don't be absurd .
i'm in control .
i have to get back now .
don't turn a game into reality and ruin our plan .
who cares , as long as the plan works .
shall we rest for a while?
i smell flowers .
you told me you'd bring me to where real flowers grow .
which is the most beautiful?
how do i look?
pretty as a flower .
soldiers are approaching .
i'm on your side .
you?
i am a captain of the county .
a captain?
nonsense .
you are the bastard who broke the jail .
you're wounded .
is it serious?
no .
was it someone from the 'flying daggers '?
it's not likely .
then who?
i don't know .
he's gone .
i guess he doesn't want to reveal himself .
this time , i believe that you're for real .
you've done enough for me .
please leave .
don't worry about me .
we've come this far .
i can't leave you now .
i hope you're not seriously wounded .
we agreed there would be no more fights .
why did government soldiers turn up?
the general sent them .
they don't know you .
the general?
how did the general get involved?
this case is important .
i had to report it .
the general is taking over .
the soldiers didn't have to be that aggressive .
the general ordered it .
he said we need real blood to draw the 'flying daggers 'out .
even if the blood is mine?
jin , the soldiers 'lives and our lives are worth nothing to him .
you don't know how i felt as i killed our own men .
i feel worse .
i am tortured .
you?
i truly regret taking on this mission .
i've followed you all the way .
endured many sleepless nights .
my heart grows heavy when i think about what lies ahead .
is there no other way to do this?
it's the only way to expose the 'flying daggers '.
jin , you should know , there are more soldiers ahead .
what !
the general sent them .
they don't know you either .
you must stop them .
there is nothing i can do .
the order given to these soldiers is 'fight to kill '.
if you don't kill them they will kill you .
take care .
i quit !
