you don't like me because i don't sign autographs .
you don't like me because i don't smile for the camera .
you don't like me because i don't suck up to the press .
you don't like me because i make a lot of money .
but you love me .
because i'm one of the greatest hitters alive .
we're back in milwaukee , and the sound you hear reverberating across the cities and farms of the great state of wisconsin is the roar of the brewer faithful for their longtime hero , stan ross .
and here he comes with that trademark arrogant scowl .
2, 999 hits to date in his illustrious career .
will this at bat , july 29 , 1995 , against the rookie right hander billy earil , be the historic moment when ross joins only 20 other major leaguers in that elite 3, 000 hit club?
stan .
you're gonna be the best looking cat in the hall of fame , that's for doggone sure .
yo , scrub !
you want my autograph now or after i make history?
you ain't getting this hit off me .
this is gonna be your one career highlight .
you're gonna be a game show answer .
well , i'll take " kiss my ass " for $1, 000 .
make it 3, 000 .
you hear that language on that rookie?
kiss my ass .
how about you , ernie?
you're gonna tell me to kiss your ass , too?
why don't you suck my ...
i'll show you what kiss my ass look like .
i'll show him .
i'll put up this ...
damn it , joe !
he know better than to get me pissed off !
no pitcher wants to be the one that gives up that 3, 000th base hit .
clearly earil just sent that message .
a purpose pitch to get ross angry .
come on , this is the one .
you know what i'm talking about !
hope he trips and breaks his leg .
uhh !
oh , my !
it's a vicious line drive off earil's ...
well , it's a bell ringing base hit .
that's what it is .
stan ross is safe at first .
hey , coach , get me that ball .
that's the ball that got me to the hall of fame .
you want this ball , ross?
yeah .
thanks , man .
there goes your damn ball .
you see that , coach?
you see what he just did?
he threw my hall of fame ball in the stands .
what's your problem?
back up .
back up .
move , man !
you be out when i get back , or someone will have to pull a piece of baseball history out the crack of your ass !
what you looking at?
make a move .
okay , i'll shrink your big ass .
you'll get some , too .
you saw what he did , coach .
all right , guys .
that ain't gonna mean nothing .
get back in .
who got my ball?
open that gate .
all right !
he's coming on up .
hey , congratulations , stan !
give me my ball .
what?
what'd he say?
give me my 3, 000 hit ball .
don't look at your daddy .
give me my ball !
whoa , make him a trade at least .
give him your cap or an autographed bat .
i'm not trading him !
hey , whoa !
what the ...
are you all right , pal?
why don't you take his cotton candy while you're at it?
were you glad to get number 3, 000 here in milwaukee?
sure .
you ask any of the all time greats , man .
we all got a special connection with our hometown fans .
what connection did you make with that kid who caught the ball tonight?
what you talkin 'about?
people in that section say you threatened him .
i gave him good advice .
what the hell wrong with you people?
i just became a legend like willie mays ,
stan musial , and carl yastrzemski .
y'all gonna try to speak on something negative?
that's what i'm talkin 'about .
that's why i'm quittin '.
what?
what?
what do you mean , quitting?
quittin '.
i'm done .
hangin 'it up .
now that i got this , i ain't playin 'no more .
and that means no more talking to you stank ass reporters .
excuse me?
that's right .
i'm talking to you .
and i said " stank ass .
why now with the brewers still in the race?
couldn't you wait until after the season?
i'd have quit last season if i didn't think you were gonna try to block me from the hall of fame .
but it don't matter 'cause i got mine .
3, 000 .
like it or not , i'm a certified immortal .
and there ain't nothin 'you sons of bitches can do about it .
nothin '.
attention , all milwaukee leprechauns .
hey , all you milwaukee leprechauns .
this is st. patty's day .
get your shamrock groove on at stan ross 'mr. 3000 sports bar ,
located on peacock street in waukesha county .

bring the whole family down to mr. 3000 shopping center .
first year , i was 150 votes short .
come here .
second year , i was less than 50 and so on .
last year , i was just 4 votes away .
sportswriters hate me .
but my numbers don't lie .
i got 3, 000 up there , one for each one of my hits .
they gotta let me in .
it's my year , and everybody knows it .
what about him?
who's that?
you know who that is .
that's t rex pennebaker .
best player on the brewers .
t rex pennebaker ain't nothin '.
i don't even know why you bother learning his name , especially what you got in front of you , a living legend .
a certified immortal .
and i know you don't know a lot of immortals .
hey , easy , old man .
old man?
what you mean is " aged , " like u. s. d. a. beef .
it's what's for dinner .
not on my plate .
no?
no .
monstrous .
just ain't like the old days , huh , boca?
mnh mnh .
wow .
spring training .
you can practically smell the grass , can't you?
can't say i can , man .
what , you don't miss it?
miss it?
nah .
nah .
stan didn't make many friends when he was playing here .
he wasn't very good with the press .
we invited him to old timers 'day every year since he retired .
that's nine years .
and he never rsvp'd once .
he might not want to do this , you know what i'm saying?
no .
what are you saying?
i'm just saying , " stan ross day .
retire his number .
the fans , man .
did he go for it?
did you hit him with the fans bit?
how about where you say you didn't know if i would do it?
boca , i swear , when you get to going , you can talk a stripe off a zebra .
monstrous .
and welcome to beautiful miller park .
ladies and gentlemen , we're here today to retire number 21 , worn by one of the brewers 'all time greats .
seven times an all star , a member of that exclusive 3, 000 base hit club , the wizard of wood , the count of contact , and the king of the swing ,
milwaukee's own mr. 3000 , stan ross !
wow !
damn !
i still look good .
he hasn't lost his touch , has he?
and joining us today to pay tribute to stan ,
let's welcome former teammate bill " big horse " berelli .
who?
i think he played with you a couple of months in '79 .
he was a middle reliever .
what happened to paul molitor , man?
robin yount?
cecil cooper?
what happened to them?
they declined .
we're lucky we got him .
you know , a lot of people said that stan only looked out for himself .
that he wasn't a team player .
but i'm here to tell you that if you get 3, 000 hits , you don't have to be a team player .
what?
if you have a lifetime . 314 average , you don't have to be a good guy .
if you lead the league in batting for three years , you can be the biggest jerk in the world .
he laughin ', man .
he laughin '.
so on behalf of all of us who played alongside of you , congratulations .
go on , go on , man .
you can't help me now .
also here with us today , you remember him well , number 8 , anthony carter .
all right , come on .
tell them like it is , boca .
come on , baby .
now we're talkin '.
me and stan were teammates .
man , could he hit the ball .
tell 'em , baby .
and i loved him for that .
i love you more .
that's it?
i'm trying to get enshrined .
that's it?
man , y'all killin 'me , man .
all right , milwaukee ,
let's hear it for our brewers 'own stan ross !
thank you so much .
first , i want to thank you , mr. schembri , and the entire milwaukee brewers organization .
and to my main man , my best friend , boca carter .
and to you , old donkey .
big horse !
whatever !
but most of all , i want to thank you all .
the fans .
you were always there for me .
and i know for a fact , if it was up to you ,
i'd have been in the hall of fame a long time ago .
but unfortunately , it's up to a bunch of sportswriters .
some metalhead half asses .
how the hell do you bat 3, 000 and not be selected into the hall of fame?
what type of bullshit is that?
let me tell you something .
you all believed in me when i was at my best .
you all believed in me when i was at my worst .
you , the fans !
that's why i know for a fact
i can depend on you all to bring me , stan ross , to cooperstown .
i can hear you say " stan !
stan !
say " stan ross " !
stan ross !
stan ross !
stan ross !
he's the boss !
he's the boss !
say " hall of fame " !
hall of fame !
it's a damn shame !
over here , say , " hell , yeah " !
hell , yeah !
say , " hell , yeah " !
hell , yeah !
say , " you're the man " !
you're the man !
let me hear it again !
you're the man !
they love me .
you're the man !
you got a minute?
hang on .
what?
you know how when we think somebody's gonna be voted in , we run the numbers .
every win , every home run , every hit?
yeah .
we were running that for stan ross .
a list of every one of his 3, 000 hits .
there's an error .
one of the hits was an error?
no , all the hits were hits .
there just aren't 3, 000 of them .
okay .
start over .
okay , there was a game in may 1982 that was called for curfew .
when they finished in august , the hits were recorded twice .
once in may , once in august .
stan ross had three hits in that game .
that means that three of the hits don't count .
so you're telling me ...
stan ross , mr. 3000 ,
has only 2, 997 hits .
2, 997 hits .
as yahko tried to escape across the rope bridge , he realized that he was trapped by both sides by the dreaded , evil boars .
yahko knew his only hope was to do the unthinkable , and that was to jump far , far below into the raging , raging river .
hold on , kids .
hello?
hey ...
hey , man , the press is eating it up .
what happens to yahko?
shh , shh , shh , shh .
what happened to yahko?
what?
what happened to yahko?
what happened to yahko?
shut up !
i can't believe you said that .
2, 997?
man , that's bullshit !
oh , mr. ross .
ooh !
please , the children .
man , hell with the kids !
yahko's dead !
the hall of fame vote is in , and stan ross is not .
the always controversial ex brewer had slowly crept to within four votes of enshrinement , but this time finished 147 votes shy , following a correction in the record books that left him three hits short of the magical 3, 000 .
stan's gonna wait turn it off .
till next year to wait till next life .
from the green ...
i can't let them do it to me .
i can't let them take away my legacy .
# watch me ! #
# watch me ! #
# i got it #
# watch me ! #
# i got it , hey ! #
you love me because i'm one of the greatest hitters alive .
# i got somethin 'that tells me #
you love me because i'm one of the greatest hitters alive .
# i got soul , and i'm super bad #
you love me because i'm one of the greatest hitters alive .
# i got soul #
# and i'm super bad #
# i got it , hey ! #
i'm back !
the king with the swing , the right arm they call " the gun ,
stan ross .
nitroglycerin himself .
number 21 , the man with sweetest swing in the major league , is back .
you gotta be joking .
how old are you?
50?
47 and getting younger .
that's why i love you , man .
man , what the hell?
what's your damn problem , man?
that was 4/ 10 of a second .
that's how much time you have after the ball leaves the pitcher's hand to decide whether it's a fastball , a split finger .
wait , wait .
hold on , hold on , hold on .
what you know about the game?
you played in the majors?
figures .
he's drunk .
no , i've just been a brewers fan my whole life while you treated the team and the fans and the city like dirt .
yo , boca , get this man another bottle .
thank you .
you're welcome .
i want you to try it again .
what?
'cause last time i wasn't standing at the plate .
come on , try it again .
yeah .
boca .
see that?
three more of these .
three more hits .
as i said before , stan ross is back .
better talk to him , boca .
ladies and gentlemen , number 21 , the great , the fantastic ,
mr. incredible .
stan .
i thought when we retired his number , we wouldn't have to see that prick anymore .
he's a senior citizen .
do you think i want him here?
and he hasn't played the game in nine years .
it's not like we're in the american league anymore , so he's gotta play the field .
can he even handle first base at his age , let alone hit?
fellas .
we are in fifth place , and we are not drawing flies .
and we've got two very long months ahead of us .
the biggest crowd we've had all year was the day we retired stan's number .
now , we give him a physical .
give him a month to get in shape .
then after that september roster expansion , if he's up to it , we put him in the lineup .
bo , all i need is a bat .
that's it , baby .
look at him .
he ain't got no waist on him .
he got nothin '.
stan ross .
hey .
eddie richling .
i'm the conditioning coach .
he here to carry you home?
the only thing boca gonna carry is my plaque .
that's why i love you .
i love you more .
is that right?
how many push ups can you do?
one arm or two?
well , i'll tell you what , last time i counted , what was it , about 40 , 50?
i got 5 bucks in my pocket says you can't give me 10 .
that's easy money .
back up , man .
you better help your boy down .
he didn't help me in .
come on , let's see what you got .
okay , well , that's one .
how many is that?
oh , i don't know .
i'd say 40 , 50 .
that's four .
come on , stan .
you got this one .
oh , oh !
your knee touched , man .
that's a girl push up .
you see my knee touch?
well , it might have , yeah .
but who said girl push ups don't count?
yeah , who said girl push ups don't count?
how you want to pay me , cash or check?
oh , look at them arms starting to shake .
come on .
come on .
aah !
oof !
okay , stan , now you ready to get started for real?
man , what type of shit is this?
hydrostatic weighing .
it's how we determine how much body fat you really have .
i don't need my balls washed to tell you how much i weigh .
hold your breath , stan .
this ain't nothin 'but a southern baptism .
it's called modern technology , stan .
recently , the brewers have incorporated new methods of training into their exercise regimen .
we're gonna get you started on this bad boy .
look at this .
mm hmm .
this looks like some punishment .
actually , it's very gentle .
it's called pilates .
pi what?
breathe in .
okay , feel the extensors now .
i feel like flipper .
b , that's what i'm talkin 'about .
i'm gonna start off real light , about 463 .
you can throw 463 on if you want to , chicken chest , but your equipment is right over there .
remember what i told you .
keep that ass up .
all right , push !
whoa , where you going?
is this a joke?
it's only a joke if you think weak abs are funny .
feel it in your lats?
you ask me about my lats .
yeah , i feel it .
my spine and my butt , too .
push it !
push it !
push it !
come on !
aah !
# it's fun to stay at the y. m. c. a. #
# it's fun to stay at the y. m. c. a. #
# they have everything for young men to enjoy #
# you can hang out with all the boys #
whoa , where you going?

# it's fun to stay at the y. m. c. a. #

'cause i'm stan ross !
# you can get yourself clean , you can have a good meal #
# you can do whatever ... #
so , tomorrow , man , you ready?
game's changed a lot since we last played .
i still see the ball .
i still hit the ball .
all day .
but i do miss playin '.
i know i always said i didn't , but i do .
ain't nothin 'like hittin 'in the major leagues .
bein 'a part of that great tradition .
i never felt that type of respect that i felt on the ball field .
that kind of attention .
oh , shoot , that reminds me .
you got a call this afternoon .
some ad agency guy from new york .
endorsement?
was it reebok?
it's not reebok .
adidas or nike?
viagra .
what?
viagra , man .
you'd be the spokesman .
i ain't gonna be no damn spokesman for no viagra .
i can still swing my bat , bo .
are we ready to roll here?
okay , the milwaukee brewers are pleased to be able to help a member of the brewer family reclaim his rightful place in baseball history .
so it is with great pride that i introduce to you the once and future mr. 3000 , stan ross .
thank you .
thank you , mr. schembri , and the milwaukee brewers organization .
and i promise , it won't be like last time when i'm in front of the microphone with all that cussin 'and shit , you know?
hey , stan .
yes?
is this only about getting back to 3, 000 hits , or do you believe you can help make the brewers more competitive on the field?
how could i not make them more competitive?
let me be a little polite here .
the milwaukee brewers are weak .
here we go .
who they got?
they're a little league team .
you all know it .
they need me .
how do you think you'll adjust to the contemporary game?
you ever heard of harold melvin & the blue notes?
earth , wind & fire?
some things just always play well .
a little " old school " is what this team needs .
you nervous?
what if you don't hit?
what's that?
i said , " what if you don't hit?
if all this talk is just talk and it becomes obvious you're hurting the team , will you take yourself out of the lineup?
i said i'm gonna hit .
when i say i'm gonna do something , i do it .
that's not always how it works .
well , it is for me .
not the way i remember .
maybe you remember something you thought i said i was gonna do , but didn't say i was gonna do it ,
'cause i cold blood do everything i say i'm gonna do .
is that the way you were raised?
straight up and down , like 6 : 00 .
so what does your mama think about this comeback foolishness?
why are we getting on this mama stuff?
okay , that's it for today , folks .
thank you very much .
just get one more question .
get in line .
you really nailed him on that one .
maureen .
hey .
what you doing here?
what do you think?
i'm covering the story for espn .
uh huh .
why you , though?
they sent me .
just by chance , you ain't here to see me?
no , i'm on assignment .
they asked me to cover a story , so i'm covering it , period .
i'll see you at the ball park .
mo , mo , mo , mo .
wait , wait .
how about an exclusive?
see?
you and me?
huh?
you think you'll get three hits in your first three at bats and get this thing over with?
come on , mo , i'm 47 years old .
it'll probably take me maybe four at bats .
you're one of a kind , stan ross .
thank you for sitting with us .
good luck tonight .
thank you .
that's it .
thanks , guys .
that's a wrap .
that wasn't too bad , was it?
that was great .
after i get my hits today , you want to come by and celebrate?
you know , you better keep your mind on the game , mr. 3000 .

uh huh , sound effects could be a little bit louder when a brother hit .
that shit should sound like a cannon !
mr. ross .
i'm rick , the clubhouse assistant .
just stan .
i'm just stan .
all right .
that's your locker over there .
the arizona diamondbacks and the milwaukee brewers .
go ahead , man , it's in my locker .
i'm stan ross .
i know very well who you are .
i grew up watching your excellent play on television .
you are hero to many young japanese players .
but you have hole in your ass .
hole in my ass?
what's his problem?
that's fukuda .
he was taught english in school in japan , but they never taught him to cuss worth a damn .
but why he cuss me out?
i never did nothin 'to him .
brother , you're looking at 25 little leaguers in here who want to give you an ass whupping .
oh , 6 3 !
6 3 , man !
6 4 .
you're right , 6 4 .
i was trying to cheat .
minadeo , skillett .

they'll go at it over anything .
what are you talking about?
no !
that's half out .
it all got to be in .
it half went in .

you're always trying to pull this .
what do you say , grandpa?
does that count?
grandpa?
here it is .
uh oh .
lineup !
base hit , dinner's on me .
ah , yes !
now batting leadoff .
skills that pay the bills .
whoo !
was panas here yet back when you were playing?
yeah , he was here .
i don't think i was one of his favorites .
stan ross , you bat eighth !
ha ha !
eighth?
that's for banjo hitters .
man , i never batted lower than fifth in my life .
you bat that now , you son of my dick .
son of my dick?
hey , what size you swinging over there , old school?
34 ounce , like i always have .
you sure you can still get around with that at your age?
don't you worry about me .
i've been swinging this thing sweet before you knew which side of the bat was the good end .
whoo !
yeah , i swing a 36 myself .
yeah , that's big talk .
i got a hammer my damn self .
whew .
come on , coach .
ross , you suck !
how's it feel , stan?
how about an interview after the game?
come on , now , don't distract me when i'm hittin '.
hitting's my business .
that's what i'm talkin 'about .
lookin 'good , stan .
stan !
still the wizard of wood !
bingo .
oh , yeah .
i'm about to take care of business .
charge !
charge !
charge !
bottom of the third , and the cheers you hear , and the boos , for that matter , are for stan ross .
it's the reason most of the 38, 000 plus fans are here tonight .
first baseman , number 21 , stan ross .
this guy throws pretty hard , pops .
is that right?
well , i hit pretty hard , son .
strike one .
come on , stan .
be aggressive .
i am .
stay focused .
keep your eye on the ball .
i'm looking dead at it .
i don't need you to tell me what to do .
come on in .
i've been here before .
this ain't my first picnic , baby .
ooh , stan was a hair off timing that big breaking ball from hamilton .
of course , all season , a lot of hitters , who aren't 47 years old , have been fooled by hamilton .
and we're the little leaguers?
not so aggressive , baby .
whew .
focus .
he playin 'to you .
let him play to you , baby .
come on .
come on , stan .
come on , baby .
strike !
inside fastball , and stan ross is out of there on three straight pitches .
it looks like it could be a long night for the king of swing .
what up?
welcome to " sportscenter .
stuart scott with you .
we got some more baseball .
braves at brewers .
who cares?
well , stan ross cares .
the first week at bat was a lot like the first week out of the womb for stan .
a lot of drooling and a lot of just flailing around for the erstwhile king of swing .
let's check out the highlights .
well , stan the man more like stan the statue , just chillin 'at a curve for strike one .
next pitch .
now , wait a second .
what was it that stan said about the rest of his team?
the milwaukee brewers are weak .
who they got?
they're a little league team .
they need me .
uh huh .
little leaguers , huh?
well , my 9 year old has a better swing and better eyes than that .
oh !
just chillin 'at a called strike three , and , well , that'll get you some halitosis action .
yeah , when you get just a little too close to the umpire .
stan's not done .
he decided to do a little spring cleaning .
either that , or he just wants to symbolize how well he's been playing .
yeah , garbage !
now , i'm not gonna say that every brewer but stan had a hit , but i am gonna say that every brewer but stan that played had a hit .
our maureen simmons was at the game and had postgame duty .
not the day stan ross or the milwaukee fans had in mind .
word around the organization is that manager gus panas is particularly unhappy having ross back in the lineup .
apparently he hasn't forgotten the way stan abandoned the team in the middle of the pennant race nine years ago .
stuart .
the press is having a field day .
hey , they're just getting even with stan for all those years of abuse .
for turning this team into a laughingstock .
five games and hasn't gotten close to a hit .
how long do we let this go on?
we got 35, 000 people in the park today .
we're committed to this .
whether stan ross ever gets another hit or not .
you sure you don't want anything stronger than club soda?
oh , no , i'm good .
thanks , boca .
why you call him boca?
look at him .
he look like he's ready for boca raton with them tracksuits .
stan don't appreciate my velour .
that's all he wears .
mo , i swear , he has a black one for funerals .
just comin 'from me , i think my man take his old reebok endorsement deal a little too serious .
hey , a lifetime supply .
that's why i love you .
no , that's why i love you .
no , i love you more .
no , i love you more .
no , no , i started the love .
and your life's been richer ever since .
i hear you .
nice to see you again , mo .
mm , you too , tony .
so , you hire a fancy decorator to help you do this place?
girl , you need to quit fightin '.
you know doggone well you thought i was gonna be old and tired when i quit the game .
i never thought about it .
you thought it .
but i got news for you .
i own this place , and i own all the stores next door .
3000 suds , 3000 woks , and 3000 beeps .
that's why you're comin 'back .
so all them names make sense .
sister , you know why i'm comin 'back .
'cause i deserve to be in the hall of fame with the immortals .
you know , you really shouldn't word it like that .
is that right?
mm hmm .
what?
oh , you know what .
you better hush .
you eatin 'that steak .
let me see something .
come here .
flex .
mnh mnh .
mo , mo , baby , look at you .
come on , mo .
look at you , mo .
oho !
and quick still .
you gonna eat this?
you sure got time to eat .
baby , you hungrier than a hostage .
ooh , take a bite out of crime .
that killed me there , i'll tell ya .
i thought the lady must have ...
wait a minute .
wait , wait , wait .
you don't train no more .
you don't drink no more .
what's up with that?
'cause i remember you used to drink half the american league underneath the table .
i realized i had to start cuttin 'loose from those things that weren't getting me anywhere .
where you need to be gettin '?
on with my life .
we don't stay young forever .
come on .
you know we're young enough .
ooh , i don't think so , mr. ross .
come on , i know you remember what it was like .
you can't say we didn't have something special .
good night .
what about kansas city?
that was a mind blowing weekend .
you mean to tell me you forgot about that?
bye bye .
cleveland , when i had your toenails poppin 'off like redenbacher .
bye .
come on , how about toronto?
god .
uh huh .
oh .
come on , say it .
come on , now .
you know i didn't expect you in toronto .
you know how those canadian groupies are .
come on , now .
you know what?
don't give me that crap .
you're a selfish man .
you always were .
okay , if you so upset , why was you willing to get back with me?
we got together for a night , but i didn't stay for breakfast , did i?
we'd still be doin 'it if you didn't take that espn gig .
when there's a better offer on the table , you gotta take it .
i'll pay for it .
bye bye .
the count is 1 1 on the second baseman minadeo .
brewers down by 4 .
runner at first .
they sure could use a little spark here .
glickman now on the mound , working from the stretch .
throws to first and picked him off .
skillett is caught napping .
when is this ball club going to wake up?
another mistake .
minadeo steps back in .
here's the wind and the pitch .
swung on , a one hopper back to the mound .
he bobbles it , but what's minadeo doing?
he's not running .
now they pick it up .
the throw to first , and he's out .
aah !
come on !
look at that .
there should be a man on first and second right now .
but easy , gus .
don't get excited .
i don't want you to pop no blood vessel .
what you all havin ', prayer?
the only shining star on the team these days is their strapping young outfielder , t rex pennebaker .
but even his impressive power numbers have done little to stop the brewers 'losing streak .
pennebaker digs in .
and here's the windup and the pitch .
swung on and a deep , deep drive to left field .
it's going , going .
it is gone !
4 1 .
yet another bases empty home run for t rex pennebaker .
what the hell is that?
that right there?
that's a little somethin 'for " sportscenter .
plus , that's gonna look tight in next year's video game .
what the hell you call yourself doin '?
yo , i'm puttin 'the show in the show .
but your team losin '.
instead of playin ', you makin 'like mr. bojangles .
i just hit a home run , son .
maybe you was takin 'a grandpa nap during that part .
but your team gettin 'picked off .
your boys ain't beatin 'out grounders .
there should've been two men on when you hit that homer .
it should be a ball game right now .
so yell at them , old school .
get up out of my face .
i did my job .
you the superstar .
you set the tone .
listen here .
when you get a base hit in this millennium , then you can come on down there and talk to me .
is that right?
yeah , that's right .
hey , stan , you think that diaper's affecting your swing?
maybe you should use something lighter .
how about a wiffle bat?
how 'bout i shove my hall of fame bat up the crack of your mascot ass?
make you a hot dog on a stick , bitch .
yeah?
i might be a sausage with teeth , but you sure as hell ain't no hall of famer .
# if you disrespect # what?
# everybody that you run into #
looks familiar?
familiar?
you ain't changed nothin 'since back in the day .
in fact , i don't think you even vacuumed .
well , why mess with perfection?
oh , i can think of a lot of descriptions for this couch , and " perfection " ain't one of 'em .
what's the deal there?
how come i hardly see you on " sportscenter " anymore?
you know .
they got some pretty young thing they tryin 'to groom .
that's bull .
they can't treat you like that .
i remember once upon a time i pushed out the 40 year old .
i been playin 'this game long enough to know how it goes .
but i've been lookin 'ahead toward it , you know?
i'm gonna start producing next year .
i'm goin 'behind the camera .
oh , you go , girl .
like i've been telling you , you can't beat father time .
well , how come you really haven't settled down?
the right man wasn't right .
# i've been really trying , baby #
what's the matter with you?
that's my song .
# trying to hold back this feeling for so long #
come on , bump with me .
don't leave me hangin '.
come on .
i need you , now .
don't leave me hangin '.
come on .
come on .
come on out here .
all right , only 'cause i like this song , too .
not 'cause i like you .
i'll take it . # whoo , let's get it on # come on .
# oh , baby #
# let's get it on #
hey . # let's love , baby #
# let's get it on #

stan .
yeah , baby?
honey , stop chasing the butt .
you know what , mo?
the best sex i ever had was with you .
what?
yeah .
you had girls in every city in baseball .
it wasn't the best .
why is that?
we do it longer?
not really .
more positions , then?
i ain't goin 'there .
mm hmm .
more times a night?
oh , you still hold the record .
i don't know , baby .
i guess i like the rest of it .
the rest of it?
what's left?
well , you know .
i like the sleepin 'and the talkin 'and hangin 'out and stuff like that .
# giving yourself to me #
# can never be wrong # but that's not sex .
it is to me .
no , it's not sex .
what you call that , then?
# ooh ooh #
# now , don't you know #
# how sweet and wonderful life can be? #
# ooh ooh #
# i'm asking you #
before we go too far , i can't spend the night .
why not?
early flight .
where you got to go?
i got three games before we go on the road .
but i got to get back .
you got to get ...
wait , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait .
are you givin 'up on me , mo?
what you got to say?
i don't have a say .
i just go where i'm assigned .
you tell 'em i'm startin 'to swing the bat good again?
i'm just a reporter .
i don't make the news or decide what is the news .
you're givin 'up on me , too .
mnh mnh .
you just got to make the news , baby .
start hittin 'that ball .
come on .
what?
come on .
you want to go up?
stay down?
what?
no .
i'm not in the mood right now .
you ...
you're kiddin '.
you're not in the mood?
no .
oh , come on , baby .
no , i got a headache .
really?
you gonna tell me you got cramps , too?
maybe .
you know ...
whatever .
all right , now .
i'm leavin '.
lord , just when i thought i'd seen it all .
when you get a base hit in this millennium , then you can come on down ...
i can still swing my bat .
you think you'll get three hits in your first three at bats?
more like stan the statue .
when you get a base hit ...
you just got to make the news , baby .
start hittin 'that ball .
one , two , three strikes , you're out !
oh , bat boy .
ooh , ooh , a little testy .
a little testy .
anybody have a stan ross rookie card?
quite valuable .
if you look on the back , you'll see it's written in latin .
you see , very old .
very old card .
it's on parchment .
he's now 0 27 in his comeback .
at what point , peter , does the rust come off?
i'm not sure it does .
remember , jim palmer tried to come back after he was in the hall of fame , and he kept himself in better shape than ross .
why does the media hate this guy so much?
he's a jerk .
because t rex is the best in power and performance .
find it at radio shack .
radio shack .
you've got questions .
we've got answers .
'cause i want my hits that got stolen from me .
those hits are my ticket to the hall of fame .
he's not going to the hall of fame !
you think three hits are keeping you out?
3, 000 hits , baby , it's automatic .
look at me .
you're 47 years old .
you're fat .
you're out of shape .
favorite portion of the show , the comedy portion .
i'm gonna say it here , the woman that puts on the sausage outfit that races around miller park has got a better chance of getting a hit than stan ross .
that's not fair , tom .
he's a black athlete .
black athletes age slower .
george foreman didn't know when to get out .
mike tyson didn't know when to get out .
michael jordan struggled , and he was only out two years .
this guy hasn't played since i was married to my first wife .
it just isn't possible to get out of his day .
he's a bad teammate .
stan ross was a great athlete .
stan is all about stan .
the brewers knew what they were getting into .
it's a publicity stunt , just like when the white sox hired that midget .
tom , you can't say " midget .
he's small .
that guy was small for a friggin 'midget .
it's like if the red sox thawed out ted williams , although he'd hit better than stan .
listen , stan's playing like he's frozen .
stan is embarrassing .
he's embarrassing me .
he's embarrassing him .
he should give it up .
but when an athlete gets to that point , he loses all his pride .
yeah , you're making me cry .
i don't think he's embarrassed .
i think he's having a party at his place , got bitches all around and counting all his money .
i don't think stan cares .
wrong !
he's embarrassed .
he used to be able to hit , cannot hit now .
very embarrassing , especially with all the bitches he got around .
hey , boca .
you think i should quit?
do your thing , man .
you think?
i'm just saying .
yeah , you're right .
i got three home games against the astros before we go on the road .
i'm gonna play those games , and that's it .
if i don't get a hit , it's over .
i'm not goin 'on the road .
what you think , boca?
do your thing , man .
you think?
i'm just saying .
yeah .
you're right .
you want to get married?
you the only one that love me .
i'm serious .
i've been waitin '20 years for you to ask me that .
and now that you have , i don't know .
yeah , you right .
okay , erica kane .
dog , come on .
all my children .
you need to step up the degree of difficulty , brother .
asa buchanan .
that's abc , right?
i ain't telling you nothing .
oh !
one life to live .
yeah .
okay , i got one .
come on .
don roberto .
don roberto .
oh , that's the dude with the cologne .
guiding light .
what?
wrong !
it's " amigas y rivales .
no , we're not doing spanish shows , man .
i don't know what you're saying .
what the hell they doing?
seeing who can name the soaps .
you known me for two years .
have i ever spoke spanish?
hey .
why don't you have a contest guessin 'which team losin '?
stupid .
come on , stan .
get a hit , grandpa .
strike !
charge !
come on , brewers !
oh !

he tucks his arm in on the curve .
number 21 , stan ross .
out !
you see that?
hey , skillett !
you see that?
i was all over that nickel curve ball .
looked like a groundout to me .
say what , partner?
i said , " it looked like a groundout to me .
you don't see it .
he tipped his pitch , and i called it .
koron , how long has this pitcher been in the league?
two years .
two years , man !
he's showin 'his pitch , and he don't know it .
watch his right arm .
his elbow go in like this .
he grip the ball .
he throwin 'a curve ball .
dip , grip , curve ball .
come on , man !
skillett !
come on , baby !
come on !
runners lead away , and fukuda working from the stretch .
the pitch , and a swing and a solid line drive single to left field .
and another run scores .
the astros in a position now to break this game wide open .
hey !
you okay?
i don't want panas to take me out .
i had a few bad outings in a row , and if i don't get my face out my ass and get out this inning ,
i know the team is going to give me the shoe .
give you the shoe?
yeah , the shoe .
look , don't be thinkin 'negative out here , okay?
just keep the ball low and away .
we'll get you out the inning .
then i'm gonna work on your cussin '.
come on .
let's go , baby .
let's go .
shortstop , number 3 , cecil gervis .
gervis , with a 6 game hitting streak , at the plate .
fukuda checks his sign .
the right hander from the stretch , checks the runners now , and here's the pitch .
a big swing and a slow roller towards short .
skillett charges .
his only play is to first .
he's safe .
the bases are loaded .
and ross is hot .
that's the third out !
that's the third damn out !
ray charles could've called that call !
last warning .
damn you , man !
be with me .
just be with me .
come on , let's go .
let's go !
two out !
i don't know why i bothered comin 'back .
you can't play .
you definitely can't ump .
you need to relax before you pop a valve .
you need to sit your ass down .
yeah?
why's that?
because you out !
he's out !
right here .
right here , baby !
grab some , bitch !
# whoomp , there it is ! #
# whoomp , there it is ! #

he tipped his pitch .

yeah , i'm talking about it .

i hit 43 home runs .
43 home runs before you ever even got here , man .
so i don't need none of that .
so save it !
t rex .
t rex .
it's the 31st time you've homered but your team's lost .
does that get to you?
my team lost , huh?
you know what , man?
this ain't my team .
if this was my team , these fools would be hittin 'home runs like i'm hittin '.
and they'd be stealin 'bases like i'm out there stealin '.
i'm the only one out there gettin 'mine .
what the rest of these fools doin '?
they ain't doin 'crap !
talk about a team !
we go out there every day , but there ain't no nine guys .
this is me up in here .
there's eight other cats ...
whoa !
boy , that pup sound just like me back in the day , i swear .
boy , i'm tellin 'you .
but you didn't catch the real story on tonight's game .
no , come here .
let me ask you a question .
move it over there .
when was the last time you saw a 47 year old man end an inning with the hidden ball trick , huh?
is that the first time you pulled that off in a game?
are the brewers goin 'to the world series?
it was 1989 , against the mariners .
yo , t rex .
hold up .
you know why i stepped in tonight with them reporters?
yeah .
you can't stand to see another brother gettin 'some attention .
boy , that's what you think?
yeah , man , that's what i think .
let me tell you something .
you keep talking about your teammates the way you do , boastin 'about yourself , you're gonna end up all by yourself .
all alone and empty , like you are right now .
you know what's gonna happen?
they're gonna retire your number someday , and big horse berelli gonna be standin 'up there with you .
yeah?
who the hell is big horse berelli?
that's my point exactly .
nice car .
he's picking up his stride , blowing away the competition .
looks like the bratwurst is getting smoked .

the astro infield moving in .

infield tight , hitter's delight .
a great chance to get hit number 2, 999 .

a good fly ball , okay?

let me paint you a picture .
go ahead .
miller park , standing room only .

i got it .
43, 000 screaming fans , and they're there for one reason and one reason only .
to watch the legendary stan ross step to the plate and dig in .
shoot , that ain't no picture .
that's a damn rembrandt .
i agree , and that's why i'm telling gus not to play you on the road .
hold on , man .
chill out , baby .
what are you talking about?
man , we're on a roll .
we're going for third place .
you're one hit away from making history , stan .
don't you think you owe it to the fans to do it here at home?
hmm?
i don't know .
you're takin 'half my at bats away .
although i hit a home run , i'm still 2 for 51 .
2 for 58 !
# stan ross is at the plate , the fans , they sit and wait #
look , what i'm sayin 'is , don't cut me out .
the team need me .
come on , now .
stan , you heard the sausage .
you're 2 for 58 .
the team doesn't need you to get third place .
they're on fire !
come on , let's face it .
but you , my friend , you have got to start thinking about life after baseball .
i'm talking endorsements , product lines .
a stan ross candy bar .
i want you doing press all week long on the road , stan .
you pull this off , nothing's gonna keep you out of the hall of fame .
you're a champion .
hey , stan , tom arnold here .
congratulations on everything .
the team's on a tear .
you won seven in a row .
you guys could finish third .
are you really talking to us from the clubhouse?
well , they're not gonna play me until i come home , so i might as well do something else with my time .
stan , how does it feel not to be playing right now?
it don't feel good , especially the way i've been swinging , but that's skip's decision .
i have to go with it because , as you say , we got a chance to make third place .
and they were in fifth place when you got there .
i finally got them playin 'patented stan ross baseball .
okay , stan .
stan ross , at 47 , the oldest man to homer in the major leagues .
how's it feel?
to tell you the truth , we never thought you could do it , and some of us hoped you wouldn't , so we owe you an apology big time .
well , it takes a big man to admit when he wrong , but like my teammate kenji fukuda taught me to say ...
what the hell is he talking about?
stan .
what does the future hold?
yeah , stan .
what about number 3, 000?
what game are you gonna get this hit in?
i think i'm gonna get it on the next at bat .
you got another homer left in you?
keep your popcorn by your side 'cause it's comin '.
stan ross .
is it gonna be a home run?
the faster you throw it in , the quicker it's goin 'out .
hey , stan .
i hope you weren't listening to the trash we were talking about you before you hit your groove .
tom , you wouldn't be where you are if it wasn't for roseanne .
you know what?
that would have hurt if it wasn't true .
stan ross .

i'm sure to stay on that roll , what , are you taking the ensure every day?

and then you have a sensible meal for dinner .
i can do anything a 20 year old can do .
any doggone thing , baby .

and i can do it all night .
dave?

i started my own little stuff right here .
check this out .
look at that .
my own little candy .
" ross bar .
get a shot of that one .
that is the most ratty ass candy bar i've ever seen .
it's a piece of loose leaf paper you wrote " ross bar " on .
it's a prototype .
oh , the prototype .
you gotta start somewhere .
you know , i'm an entrepreneur .
once you get over the initial modesty , i think you'll be fine .
you talkin 'to the ladies 'pet the men regret .
i'm stan ross .
what's my name , baby?
stan ross !
they call me what?
the boss !
because i ...
pay the cost !
because i'm ...
stan ross !
turn it up , baby !
stan ross .
be right back right after this .
don't go away .
yes , sir .
boca !
yo , bo !
did you see me , baby?
ha ha .
jay and i did our thing .
that ain't no espn .
i'm talkin 'big time .
hey .
hey , baby .
don't you " baby " me .
i went to the park this morning , and you weren't there .
your entire team was there , and you're a no show .
well , i mean ...
well? " didn't you call for the practice?
besides letting down your teammates , you told me i could interview you .
well , interview me now .
come on , turn the camera on .
it's not like i'm hiding from you .
i'll come right around .
that ain't nothin '.
shoot .
come on , baby .
all right , forget this .
i'll freestyle it .
mark , steve , are you ready?
you didn't ask if i'm ready .
you always ready .
let me get on that side .
you can see the balls .
it looks better .
hey , how you doin '?
all right .
good .
come on , baby .
i'm here with hall of famer hopeful stan ross , who is now just one hit from reclaiming his cherished 3, 000 career hits .
but let's talk about the name " mr. 3000 .
fit just right , doesn't it?
why is there so much emphasis on the name?
why do you care so much about it?
because it identifies greatness .
when you think of mr. 3000 , you think of mr. stan ross , one of the greatest hitters straight up and down .
who were you before mr. 3000?
mr. 3000 .
i'm just kidding .
before that , i was a young black kid on the south side of chicago , stanley ross , playin 'baseball .
what does stanley ross think of mr. 3000?
he wants his autograph .
really?
really .
what about your teammates?
they don't need it .
they get the chance to see history in the making .
oh , okay .
so what you're saying is , your teammates get to see your 3, 000th hit , but not potentially move into third place?
what i'm saying is , thousands of people bought tickets this weekend , not to see us play for third place , but to see me get my hit .
really?
damn right .
it's the same reason why everybody else here .
same reason why you here , unless you're here for something else .
oh , okay .
you selfish son of a bitch !
you don't want that on camera .
no , i'm fine .
because i'm not the one who's desperate to live his entire life in front of the camera .
tell them about toronto and the history you left there .
that's so old .
your damn ego is so old !
it hasn't changed , stan .
i mean , how am i supposed to think about moving here when you can't do what you say you're gonna do?
mo , it's only one damn practice , baby .
you know it's bigger than one practice , stan .
but you're right .
i am here to record your history in the making .
and it's the same as it ever was .
mo .
you gonna run after her?
no .
i'll catch her later .
i got ball games to play .
what?
whew .
what?
no , i'm just saying , man , that's why i love you , man .
wait a minute .
what do you mean?
i'm just saying that i could always count on you to do your thing , you know?
you're consistent .
you're always driven .
and you're always for yourself .
you sayin 'that's a good thing?
i'm just saying .
# come on ! #
just two weeks ago , fans , the milwaukee brewers seemed willing to accept their perennial position in the division cellar .
is it more than a coincidence that their solid defense and clutch hitting started with stan ross '2, 998th hit?
while ross was just a spectator during their last road trip ,
t rex pennebaker has emerged as the team leader .
we've all witnessed the mounting frustration for ross , who has gone hitless in the first two games against the astros in this , his final home stand .
you can't help but wonder what's going through his mind as ross 'window of opportunity to join that elite 3, 000 hit club is about to close and close before a nationwide audience .
so , here we are .
the stage is set .
a re energized team plays for respectability , while stan ross knocks on the door of baseball greatness .
tonight , 35, 000 fans witness as history unfolds over nine innings of brewers baseball .
last chance to go out there and get yours .
we have a lineup change tonight .
in hopes of squeezing out an extra at bat for ross , he's hitting cleanup right behind rex pennebaker .
now batting , first baseman , number 21 ,
stan ross !
this big crowd is charged tonight .
the right hander norton , one of the most competitive pitchers in the league , will do everything he can to avoid being a footnote in baseball history .
one game , one more hit , and he has that magical 3, 000 .
ball .
they're on their feet , rooting for ross to get ahold of one , as norton gets his sign .
ross puts a good swing on it .
it's deep to right field and carrying well .
damn .
yo , ross !
why don't you take a seat?
you ain't gettin 'that hit off me tonight !
deal with it !
this guy's slider sucks .
come on , man .
i guess somebody should have showed up to that practice .
home half of the fourth .
it's still a scoreless tie .
this crowd ripe with anticipation every time ross steps to the plate .
ross swings .
a sharp ground ball up the middle .
second baseman gomez with a diving stop .
he scrambles .
it's gonna be close .
he's out !
oh , my , what a close play !
from our angle , i thought he was safe .
you're wrong !
i'm surprised stan ross isn't protesting the call .
that man was safe !
that man was out .
what game are you watching?
i called the man out .
i'm watching the same game you are !
we are playing for third place !
the man was out !
don't make me run you , gus .
you got your head so far up your ass , you didn't see the play !
head up my ass?
that's right !
head up your ass !
that's what i said !
that's it !
you're outta here !
you're outta here !
let me tell you something !
get off of my field !
you're the worst umpire in this whole league !
outta here !
you're such a jerk !
the man was safe !
the guy's out !
he was safe !
walk him off the field !
get him off my field !
you were safe !
you were safe !
you were beautiful .
come on , tiger .
he was safe !
so it boils down to the bottom of the ninth inning .
still scoreless here in the final game of the season .
mr. 2999 " very likely will be making his last plate appearance of a storied big league career .
but first the man who's become sort of ross 'protege of late ,
t rex pennebaker .
we've got an interesting situation here , fans .
if pennebaker homers , that's the game , and ross won't get another shot .
go , t !
come on , baby !
come on , baby .
get on .
i'll bring you home .
come on , get on , baby .
just get on .
and that ball is crushed .
a line drive to deep left center .
it's going , going .
it is off the base of the wall .
pennebaker rounds first , heading for second .
and he is safe with a ringing double .
oh , man !
he almost took the bat right out of stan ross 'hands .
but now ross is up with not only a chance for his 3, 000th base hit and a call from cooperstown , but an opportunity to drive in the winning run and end the brewers 'season on a high note .
3, 000 , baby !
all right .
come on .
ball .
pitch to him .
let's go , man .
get your hit .
ball .
pitch to me , damn it !
reach out there and get it , then .
reach out and get it .
those first two deliveries , way outside .
ross now crowding the plate .
2 balls , no strikes .
nothing close from norton .
i'm right here !
here we go .
this is it .
3 0 , the count .
this crowd roaring , begging norton to challenge ross with a decent pitch .
i could always count on you to do your thing , you know?
you're consistent .
you're always driven .
and you're always for yourself .
that's why i love you .
look at this !
ross lays a sacrifice bunt up the first base line , and t rex isn't stopping at third .
here's a throw to first base , and ross is out .
here comes the play .
the slide , the tag .
he is safe !
he is safe !
the brewers win !
the brewers win !
# we're movin '#
# groovin '#
# ain't no stopping us now #

stan !
stan !
stan !
stan !
corny enough for you?
well , it gets worse .
first off , now all of a sudden , the press loves me .
took 'em long enough , though , huh?
the hall of fame voted me in on the very next ballot .
and as you can imagine , i had plenty of people to thank .
and old mo .
she decided to move back to milwaukee after all .
i know she said i'd never get serious , but these days , i'm even thinkin 'about gettin 'married .
you know , so i can have that great sex all the time .
and hot damn , if boca didn't just up and move to boca .
i can see him right now , helping some lost soul , sayin ',
" do your thing .
do your thing .
and me , i retired again , like you probably figured .
but i didn't want to go out without leavin 'the fellas a little somethin 'to remember me by .
even though i left the game ,
i couldn't stay too far from it , so i bought me that song .
# out of the tree of life #
# i just picked me a plum #
and that's the whole story .
like my baby mo says ,
it's all about figurin 'out who you are .
and some of that's just a matter of gettin 'a little older and acceptin 'it .
and i can deal with that .
just 'cause i'm retired don't mean i'm invisible .
in fact , i'm guessin 'you've probably seen my commercial once or twice yourself .
# the best is yet to come #
# and , babe , won't it be fine? #
# you think you've seen the sun #
# but you ain't seen it shine #
# wait till the warm up's underway #
