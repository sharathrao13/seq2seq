you want to play against me?
you hav e no chance .
your gift isn't strong enough .
you don't know that .
i'v e known you since you surviv ed that earthquake .
or was it maybe somebody els e who took you under his wing , who fed you , paid your way through s chool ,
made you somebody  my luck sav ed me .
you told me that .
i won't sacrifice you .
i taught you how to us e that luck .
now you think you're luckier than me , huh?
i'v e rais ed a fool .

seven years later
h is name's tomas sanz .
h e wasn't trav eling alone .
what about this?
cut it open .
n urs e !
i put up with my mother in law for three months .
she finally croaks and her associate giv es her 500, 000 pes etas .
but my wife los es the che ck .
she said it was all my fault , that i was bad luck .
i blew up that fuck up was suddenly my fault .
do you hav e a picture of her?
i'll find one .
i kicked her out of the hous e .
she slammed the door and all the papers went flying up in the air .
suddenly , a che ck for 500, 000 pes etas comes landing on my lap .
what do you think of that , federico?
am i lucky or what?
are you going to keep it?
what?
the che ck .
what do you think?
horacio caparros , you are a lucky man .
no .
giv e it to me later .
it's claudia .
pick up the phone .
i found fresh meat in that plane crash .
well , too bad .
since you're on v acation , the y pass ed the file on to me .
tough luck , huh?
this time , it'll cost you double
the y're not all dead?
all that for a measly 50 million pes etas .
or half if he surviv es .
if he had signed up for our life insurance plan , he'd get fiv e or six times as much .
that is 200 or e v en 300 million .
that's mone y .
thank you .
claudia !
h i , old man .
h ello .
is that enough?
it's purely routine .
h e's under arrest for theft .
i know .
will he get some mone y?
h e surviv ed a horrific experience .
that mone y is his .
wait until he's made his statement .
pleas e ...
i just need to make sure he signs it .
how much?
what?
how much will he get?
25 million .
do you think that will make up for such trauma?
that's what he was awarded .
still a bargain for the airline .
two minutes ...
good e v ening .
good e v ening .
i'm with the insurance company .
i need to frisk you .
thanks .
i hav e the che ck .
sign here and it's yours .
may i?
she's beautiful .
what will you do with the mone y?
excus e me?
how will you spend it?
you'll cash the che ck in two days .
yes .
it won't be of much us e where you're going .
when i'm worried , i take out my cards .
it kills time and helps me clear my mind .
sometimes , just shuffling them makes my troubles go away .
if you draw an ace , i'll get you out of here .
we're not betting anything .
tomas sanz , you are a lucky man .
sure .
don't doub t it .
there's one chance in a million for a plane to crash .
and for it to crash , leaving you the only survivor out of how many 23 7 pass engers?
one chance in 23 7 million .
one more time .
no bets either?
you play for me and you're a free man .
play?
play what?
sorry , your time's up .
we're almost done .
so , will you sign it or not?
we'll place our first bet with your compensation .
then we'll play with our gains .
in the end , we'll split e v erything 50 50 .
what if i los e?
that won't happen .
and what if it happens?
you're free to walk away .
how long will that last?
two weeks at the most .
i don't know how to play .
don't you worry , you don't need any talent .
just remember two things don't e v er touch me
why not?
just a thing i hav e .
and ne v er take my picture .
we don't need any souv enirs .
remember it .
good e v ening .
hav e the y started y et?
no .
do you want to s ee his i d?
yes .
i don't know him .
the plane lost contact with the control tower 1 2 minutes after takeoff .
the black box , which was re cently retrie v ed , should shed some light on the e v ents pre ceding the accident .
the casualty figures stand at 23 1 pass engers and six members of the crew .
the only person aliv e , tomas sanz , was arrested ...
are you here of your own free will?
... accus ed of robbing a bank two months ago .
what does it feel like when a plane is going down?
i was asleep .
come on .
you're pulling my leg .
what's this?
what's that smell?
molass es .
that's his favorite .
right .
place your bets , pleas e .
i'm sorry .
federico , you can't be here .
h e's new .
get him started and go .
h ere .
what's this?
no mone y bets .
it's not mone y .
it's a jewel .
the indemnity of the only survivor of the plane crash .
that's right ...
i knew i'd s een you before .
i won't play against him .
e v en this won't do .
one of your fingers would be a nice trophy .
if he agrees , we're game .
good idea .
so , federico?
let's play .
wait !
forget it !
come on , wait !
what about my finger?
you won't los e it .
right .
get lost .
thos e guys ... the y're fucking amateurs who won a bingo game or fell from the s e cond floor .
the y hav e no chance against you .
i won't do it .
fuck .
you surviv ed a plane crash , i helped you get out of the hospital .
isn't that luck?
and so what?
all you need in there is luck .
but i'm not stupid .
you are lucky and you can control that luck .
you're fucking insane .
let me go or i'll touch you .
let me go .
why do you think you're the only survivor?
there were good people on that plane .
what sav ed you a thief?
god?
chance .
that doesn't exist for you .
your gift is to steal other people's luck .
otherwis e , you'd be dead .
right .
i belie v e in you .
but if you don't , there's nothing els e to say .
you can keep the mone y .
you mess ed up be caus e of a finger i would hav e wagered with you .
it's yours .
place your hands on the table , gentlemen .
remov e the s carv es .
do not mov e .
h ello?
h ello?
are you still playing?
who is this?
are you still playing?
what do you think , federico?
you won't die of old age .
what?
with a bug on my head ,
i made more in one night than in a lifetime of risking my ass !
you could hav e lost a finger .
so could you .
no .
after the y'd cut yours off , i'd hav e taken off .
you can run away from them , but not from me .
i'm glad you like the game .
how do we split that thing , wis e guy?
fall and winter for you .
spring and summer for me .

i'll go look for a bedroom .
this is ana .

ana .
is that the girl in the picture?
yes .
wasn't she going with you?
she miss ed the plane .
how lucky .
how did she miss it?
we need a phone .
we hav e to tell the bullfighter .
only fear makes for a great fight .
for a real bullfighter , it's not the fear of losing , but the fear of suffering your own suffering and that of thos e around you .
it is that fear that driv es you to really fight .
why quit?
you were ne v er injured .
i lost my fear of the bull .
you can't fight the bull without fear .
h ello .

all you do is touch them as much as possible to steal the little luck the y might hav e .
then we roll the dice , and the highest number wins .
it's going to rain like hell .

this should hav e ne v er happened .
you wouldn't be here if we had found tomas .
ana ... you hav e to help me .
talk to me .
let's start from the beginning .
why didn't you take that plane?
it didn't do you any good to leav e him and es cape the accident .
h e surviv ed too , and look where that led you .
your bad luck is tomas 'fault .
h e can go to hell .
i don't belie v e you .
h e pre v ented me from taking that plane .
at the airport , he said ,
i don't lov e you anymore .
h e sav ed my life .
what did you say?
i don't lov e you anymore .
is something wrong?
why do we hav e a copy of caparros 'file?
the court required one .
what for?
h is ex wife filed a complaint .
h e committed suicide , but she wants the insurance mone y .
and van kuipp life refus es to pay .
van kuipp life?
it's the insurance company from the plane crash .
that's mine .
good e v ening .
are you claudia?
yes , i am .
wait , don't hang up .
i hear you're in charge of caparros 'and sanz's files .
that's right .
but i spoke with someone els e at the hospital .
you son of a bitch !
you son of a bitch !
tough luck .
tough luck ... right !
what will happen to ana?
we can get her back .
how so?
wager and win her picture back .
but the guy's off to u canca .
it belongs to someone els e now .
to whom?
samuel berg ... the jew .
how do you know?
h e's the fucking king of fate .
no one has surviv ed u canca in 30 y ears .
you bastard !
that's where you were taking me !
you shouldn't hav e lost .
that's why i wagered ana .
what's the game?
you're giv en a gun loaded with fiv e bullets .
you shoot first .
if you kill him , you win .
if not ... the jew shoots .
fiv e to one ... could be wors e .
the guy who got luckier than you , died .
i make the de cisions .
who will you wager?
the y took a plane to u canca .
why are you bringing me a los er?
don't play .
g rard told me you us ed his girlfriend without his knowledge .
nobody's e v er come here out of lov e .
your boy des erv es to play .
i don't usually talk to the people who come to play .
but this time ...
i want to make an exception .
look at this .
e v ery morning , the door of the barrack got opened , and the y took a few out .
first , the oldest ... then our parents , then the brothers and sisters .
in a couple of weeks , there were only about 50 of us left all children .
suddenly , the y just stopped coming .
then ... one day ... a man appeared .
h e was not a guard .
h e was wearing ... a sand colored suit .
spotless it was .
and he held a black handkerchief to his nos e .
we didn't smell too good , you s ee .
and one by one , he took us by the arm and ... jolted our numbers down in his notebook .
we would be called and reunited with our parents .
and then he left and ne v er came back .
but the guards returned .
the y lined us up and shouted a number .
i looked at my arm ... it wasn't me .
it was one of the others .
and as he walked through the door , he turned and looked at us all , thrilled to bits that he had won ... and disappeared .
and so on .
e v ery day , another number .
or two .
or none .
sometimes the y would just stand , looking at us , and then leav e .
in the end , only daniel and i were left ... for four days alone .
and we talked .
we talked a lot .
daniel knew things .
h e us ed to help his father at the watchmaker's shop .
did you know that ... if you stare at the minute hand hard enough , you can s ee it mov e?
that photo is of h elena , his sister .
daniel knew that it wasn't our parents who would wait for us outside .
and the day the door opened again ,
i took my friend's hand ... and i clos ed my e y es , willing it not to be my number .
when daniel let go of me , i couldn't open my e y es again .
i didn't want to look at him face to face .
h e just said to me , " it's yours , " and walked off .
and ... he left the photo in my hand .
the next time the door opened ... the uniforms had changed .
well , if you're ready , i think it's time to play .
i found an ele v ator leading to the bas ement .
roberto?
carlos , javier , can you hear me?
federico , you hav e to go .
hav e faith .
remember that you came out intact .
i don't lov e you anymore .
let's get out of here !
your work is done .
leav e now .
god damn it , federico , our work is done .
come on .
we won .
no , you won .
take care of yours elf .
sara?
