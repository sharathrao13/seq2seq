jackson , you going to go to hong kong?
i love anything full contact .
i need a few more scars on my face .
i heard you can get killed at that kumite .
only if you fuck up .
tomorrow we leave for the kumite .
sir?
excuse me .
col. cooke would like to see you before you leave .
what's the problem?
he found out you're going to hong kong .
he wants to talk to you about it .
tell him i'll be right there after i take a shower .
but i'll have to wait , sir .
okay .
what's taking so long , captain?
captain?
shit !
sir !
where's dux?
he was at the gym , like you said .
he took a shower , i waited , and he disappeared .
what do you mean , disappeared?
one minute he's there , then gone .
jesus christ !
if anything happens to dux in hong kong ...
get helmer and rawlins on this right away .
and i don't want to see your face again until dux is beside it !
understand?
how is he?
he's resting now .
he'll be so happy to see you .
it's so good to be here again .
i'll tell him you are here .
thank you .
look at the sword !
let's get it .
come on , frank .
what's the matter , you chicken?
no .
then get in here .
frank , you want to hang out with us , then come on !
you just going to stand there , or are you going to grab something?
shit !
they're coming back !
let's get out of here !
come on , frank !
forget him !
let's go !
that's enough , shingo .
go to your studies .
you cannot get katana sword by stealing .
it is a very special sword .
you must earn it .
i wasrt going to steal it .
you didn't flinch .
you have fighting spirit .
you're not gonna call the cops?
not if we make a deal .
what kind of a deal?
your son and my son are in the same school .
frank sees my sors skill ... ... and he desires to learn martial science , too .
yes , but what do you mean by martial science?
frank has told me you came to america to grow vines .
yes , that's right .
i work at the verne vineyard .
i came here to grow fish in my hatchery .
we both grow children .
you use science to make vines grow better .
like vines , children need training .
martial science provides a way of training .
it brings mind , body , spirit together .
that's enough .
that's all for today .
not yet .
why don't you quit , round eye?
not yet .
go practice your katas .
how come you coach him , but not me?
i brought you here to help me train my son .
don't question me !
if you expect me to be his punching bag , you can forget about our deal .
someday ... ... i'll fight in the kumite and make my father proud .
shidoshi , i feel like i've lost part of my family , too .
shingo and i were close friends , like brothers .
and you and mrs. tanaka ... ... have treated me like a son .
what will happen now?
no more training .
i stop now .
but you have so much to teach .
you don't understand .
in the war , i lost my first family ... ... my son , daughter , and wife .
they lived in hiroshima .
i left japan because of the war .
war was wrong .
i came here to start over ... ... begin a new family , have a son ... ... another chance to pass on the teaching .
for 2, 000 years ... ... knowledge passed from father to son ... ... father to son .
when shingo died ... ... it stopped .
teach me .
i can do it .
you are not japanese !
you are not a tanaka !
you taught me using any technique that works ... ... never to limit myself to one style ... ... to keep an open mind !
why?
to honor you , shidoshi .
practice until you can meditate ... ... and nothing can distract you ... ... so that you see and feel nothing ... ... except your own energy .
are you awake , shidoshi?
do you sleep with your eyes open?
how are you feeling?
like an old man .
and how about you?
i'm going to hong kong .
you sure you want to do this?
to honor you means everything to me .
i have poured all my knowledge into you .
when you fight , my spirit fights with you .
in kumite , you will need it .
hey , babe , want to go out with a real big man?
no , huh?
too handsome for you , honey?
is this your first time in hong kong?
you two are here for the kumite , aren't you?
kumite?
what is kumite?
look , guys , i know there's a secret full contact event ... ... being held in hong kong in the next few days .
yes .
hong kong is an exciting city .
i also happen to know a little bit about some of your competition .
okay .
would you just tell me how you got invited?
thanks , guys .
what?
think you can give me some competition?
sure .
i'll try .
that's what i like to hear , a kid who isn't afraid to lose .
no , i got it .
i don't want to take your money .
you ready?
yeah .
you like this kind of fighting?
yeah .
if you want to see some real fighting , you can see me fight at the kumite .
i'm here , too , for the kumite .
arert you a little young for full contact?
arert you a little old for video games?
you want to go at it again , huh?
yeah .
not bad , kid .
name's ray jackson .
i'm frank dux .
mrs. tanaka ...
mrs. tanaka?
yes?
it's very important to the government of the united states ... ... that we find frank dux .
we understand that he might have visited mr. tanaka recently .
mr. tanaka is very ill .
we're sorry to hear that .
was frank here recently?
frank came here to pay his respects .
when was that?
two days ago .
did he say , or do you know if he was going to hong kong?
i don't know .
of course you know .
we're not trying to ...
mrs. tanaka , we're very sorry to have disturbed you .
thank you very much for your time .
may i help you?
yeah , how you doing?
my name's jackson .
this is mr. frank dux .
are our rooms ready?
mr. lin in room 310 wants to see you after you check in .
who the hell's mr. lin?
i'm lin .
you jackson?
you look like a jackson .
that would make you frank ducks .
no , no .
it's dux .
gotcha .
like " put up your dukes , " right?
okay , so here's the deal .
this is the biggest kumite ever .
we got fighters from all over .
i've been assigned by the ifaa ... ... to help you and the other north american fighters ... ... to find your way around .
i'm gonna make sure you guys give it your best .
and don't disqualify by fighting outside the arena .
the triad , they are like the mafia ... ... is allowing us to hold kumite here this time .
here it comes , man , the walled city .
not a place for outsiders .
you are in hong kong .
but you are about to cross an invisible border into mainland china .
no joke , man .
it's a run down piece of no mars land ... ... in the middle of a tourist paradise .
it goes back to the old lease agreement between great britain and china .
once you step out of the sunlight into the narrow corridors ... ... it's time to protect your nuts , guys .
okay , usa !
okay , usa !
okay , guys .
first , you'll show the black dragon boys your invitation .
then you got to qualify and prove to them ... ... you can step onto the runway and not get killed .
got it?
you got it?
it says he represents the tanaka clan .
you don't look like tanaka .
shidoshi tanaka trained me .
what's the holdup?
he says senzo tanaka is his shidoshi .
what's the difference if bruce springsteen is his shidoshi?
if senzo tanaka is his shidoshi ... ... then show us the dim mak .
what the hell is a dim mak?
death touch .
thanks .
vic , choose a brick .
okay , frank .
what about this one?
no !
bottom one .
son of a bitch !
is that good enough , guys?
we honor your invitation .
no shit , you honor his invitation !
that was great .
very good , but brick not hit back .
here's a picture of the man we're looking for .
his name is frank dux .
we have reason to believe frank is here in hong kong .
his name was on a list ... ... on a flight from san francisco two days ago .
two days ago?
maybe he already left , went somewhere else .
asia's a very big place , you know .
we were hoping you'd hold onto this for reference .
we're here because frank is fighting in the kumite ... ... and we're here to stop him .
the kumite?
yes .
inspector chen ... ... we all know the kumite is happening here in hong kong .
and we all know it's going on over the next three days .
all we want you to do is pass this picture out to your men .
if they spot dux , they give us a call at our hotel .
simple .
my men already overworked .
lf it's too much trouble , forget it ...
inspector ...
we're all overworked , but we need your help .
i'll see what can be done .
you know where to reach us .
you'll come upstairs with me for an interview .
like hell !
let go of me .
you want hossein , no?
no .
hossein is an asshole .
what did you call me?
you want me to spell it out for you?
leave the girl alone .
he is the american shithead who makes tricks with bricks .
guess the kumite starts one day earlier this year , huh?
look , guys , let's all calm down , okay?
no .
she is coming with me upstairs .
no , i'm not .
if we have to fight for her ... ... then both of us will be thrown out of the kumite .
just for her?
we could arrange this another way .
do you gamble?
what is bet?
you hold this .
if i can grab it before you close your hand ... ... i get the girl .
if i cannot ... ... she's yours .
very good .
what?
you can't do this !
just relax .
take it .
geez , frankie , i hope you know what you're doing .
ready?
go .
you lose , american asshole .
looks like she's mine .
now leave the lady alone .
you understand that?
why were you with hossein?
i've been trying to get a story on the kumite .
i'm a reporter .
he tell you anything?
he told me i had nice legs .
he's right about that .
why is it that no one will talk about the kumite?
what is this air of mystery?
i'm just trying to find out what it's all about .
why are you fighting in it?
it's personal .
you want to prove your manood to the world?
the kumite is for the fighters , not for the people who read newspapers .
i've heard that it's unnecessarily brutal ... ... like a cockfight , except it's with people .
you have the wrong picture .
well , you tell me about it then .
i want to have the right picture .
okay , i'll talk to you , but one condition .
what's that?
you agree to have dinner with me tomorrow night .
well , actually , i was hoping hossein would be free .
that hurts me , just looking at it .
yo , frankie !
earth to frankie .
this is ground control .
do you copy?
it's time to get ready .
you'd better stop doing that stuff .
you might want to have kids one of these days .
victor's downstairs .
kumite express leaves in five minutes .
are you ready?
i am ready .
you can almost smell the adrenaline in this place , can't you?
yeah .
they are gonna love me over here .
you can really love asians because we're good iooking .
welcome , warriors of the world .
today you become part of a tradition ... ... that began hundreds of years ago .
the kumite was first used by the kokuryukai ... ... the black dragon society ... ... to measure the fighting skills and spirit ... ... of its members .
every five years , the best fighters in its ranks ... ... would face each other in full contact ... ... with one winner emerging as the superior warrior ... ... the champion .
the kokuryukai has been joined ... ... by the international fighting arts association ... ... as co sponsor for this event ... ... and as the guardians of a rich and powerful heritage .
after three days ... ... one fighter will prove himself to be the best .
may the mightiest warrior prevail !
now , remember , it's full contact .
there are three ways to win .
one , you knock the guy out .
two , your opponent quits and shouts , " matte .
it's like saying uncle .
three , you throw the fucker right off the runway .
piece of cake .
haji !
hajime !
that's why they call this thing " bloodsport , " kid .
watch this , frankie .
i'll show you how it's done , buddy .
haji !
asshole .
hajime !
come on , get up !
come on !
i'm going to kill you , man !
you got it !
frankie !
look at him , buddy .
yeah !
you check that out?
good stuff , jackson .
thanks .
but what took you so long?
funny .
real funny .
chong li !
chong li !
chong li !
what's going on?
that's chong li , the current champ .
he's never been defeated .
holds all the records , including the fastest ko .
he killed a guy during the last kumite .
yeah , kicked the poor bastard right in the throat .
guy died right there on the platform .
chong li stood there and watched him die .
junbi !
haji !
hajime !
chong li !
chong li !
chong li !
now i show you some trick or two .
junbi !
haji !
hajime !
fastest i ever saw !
his first fight in the kumite , he broke the fucking world record !
my buddy !
junbi !
haji !
hajime !
go home !
this is real good stuff .
how's your eel , as good as mine?
i don't know , i haven't tasted it yet .
you gotta tell them to kill it first .
you should ask for forks .
inspector chen .
what a pleasant surprise .
please join us .
no .
i never eat here .
i found some information for you .
what is it , inspector?
frank dux is at the east lake hotel in kowloon .
thank you .
hey , have some eel .
okay , dux , you know why we're here .
we're taking you back , frank .
let's go .
only when the kumite is over .
who the hell are these two scumbags?
just stay out of it , pal .
it's not your business , okay?
i ain't your pal , dickface .
look , frank ... ... the government has invested a lot of time and money in you .
uncle sam can't afford to let you get hurt .
i won't get hurt .
that's why we're here , to make sure of that .
don't make it tough on us .
i'll be in the airport in two days .
that's not good enough .
frank , read my lips .
we are taking you back now .
don't make us use 50, 000 volts on you .
excuse me .
you want to shit sparks?
you just stay put , okay?
stay put .
all those different fighters in one event .
it sounds wild .
you'd have to see it to believe it .
come on , frank .
couldrt you just get me in?
i really want this story .
it would mean so much to me .
they have strict rules .
no press .
i bet we could think of something .
i doubt it .
you telling me you never break rules?
what do you mean?
who are helmer and rawlins?
just friends .
why?
they must be very close friends .
they've been inquiring about you all over hong kong .
what do you want from me?
i'd really like you to help me get into the kumite .
but more than that ... ... i'd really like to get to know you .
after all , we have all night .
i have to go .
i know .
good luck today .
thanks .
meet me for dinner again tonight?
sure .
about the kumite , i'm sorry .
i cannot help you .
it's okay .
i'll get over it .
see you .
where the hell have you been?
you can't just disappear in the middle of kumite like that !
i got a rep to uphold , you know .
you and jackson don't tell me nothing .
you guys are driving me crazy !
right now , hurry up and change .
pick a brick , any brick .
i know .
the bottom one , right?
see?
not a scratch on it .
neither is this .
for you .
yo , frankie .
i hope we don't bump heads .
come on , let's do it , buddy .
feel strong today?
i feel fine .
good .
you're a good fighter .
good .
thanks .
this isn't the first time i've had to go undercover to get a story .
chong li !
chong li !
junbi !
haji !
hajime !
all right , frankie !
yeah !
dux !
dux !
time to separate the men from the boys .
just be careful chong li doesn't separate your head from your body .
go for the gut .
he's soft there .
what are you talking about?
chong li's weak in the gut .
that's how parades surprised him .
you listening to me?
go for the stomach and stay away from his right leg .
will you stop worrying , frankie?
i've got it under control .
you sound like my mother .
man alive .
junbi !
haji !
hajime !
i got him !
what are you doing?
keep going !
jackson !
jackson !
i put him down !
he's dead !
i got him !
yeah !
no !
stop !
chong li !
chong li !
come back , frank !
ray , i'm here .
the doctor says you're going to be okay .
you are lucky you have a head like a rock .
yeah , you'll be out of here in a week .
i'll get back at chong li .
that's a promise .
you think that's what he wants , someone to share a room with?
janice , stay out of this .
frank , i don't want to see you get hurt .
then don't watch .
if you want to argue , go elsewhere , please .
sorry .
you're not even trying to understand what this means to us , are you?
what's to understand about a bunch of guys ... ... who have to prove themselves by beating each other up?
why are you a reporter?
what does that have to do with it?
just answer the question .
my father was a reporter .
i was a good writer .
it seemed the right thing to do .
and you want to be the best reporter you can be , for him and yourself , right?
yes , that's right .
i'm just trying to be the best i can be .
not just for me , for tanaka , my shidoshi , too .
great , frank , that's just great !
go right ahead !
i just hope you don't end up like jackson , or worse !
but i'm not going to stand around and watch it .
you're blowing it , frank .
forget about the girl .
forget about getting back at chong li for ray .
you have a chance to take it all tomorrow .
do you understand?
you can be the first westerner to win this thing .
but you got to have a clear head .
you hear me?
why are you so interested in stopping the kumite?
someone almost got killed there today .
i have a friend fighting in it .
i don't want him to get hurt .
who is your friend?
his name is ... ... frank dux .
you guys here for the finals?
there aren't going to be any finals , dux , at least not for you .
don't try to stop me .
we're not .
he will .
i didn't come this far to stop now .
you shouldn't have come in the first place .
take him .
you're really being a hard ass about this .
careful .
put these on and i won't have to use it .
it's your last warning .
inspector , no .
we've got to take him back .
just give us a break .
we've chased you all over hong kong .
can we stop this?
okay , frank , you win .
but it's wrong what you're doing .
it's a mistake .
i'll meet you at the airport tomorrow .
now what?
how are we going to stop him?
follow me .
time's up .
we can't wait any longer .
give me one more minute .
i give you my word .
he'll be here .
we must follow the rules .
where's mr. dux?
i wish everyone would calm down .
i said , he'll be here .
too late .
too late?
no such thing as too late .
finally .
it's about fucking time !
sorry .
how do you feel today , dux?
i feel good .
i am ready .
dux , my man !
junbi !
haji !
hajime !
come on !
well done .
junbi !
haji !
hajime !
you are next .
prepare the platform for the final match .
this is it , frank .
you can make history here today .
you okay?
yeah .
junbi !
haji !
you break my record , now i break you .
like i break your friend .
hajime !
get him !
come on !
get up !
right on !
come on !
more !
up !
get up , frankie !
all right !
say it !
matte !
all right !
mr. dux , you fought with inspiration .
we of the kokuryukai salute you .
this is for you , shidoshi .
so you stomped him real good?
worse .
what do you mean?
he made him say matte .
all right , frankie !
don't you get too cocky .
because you might have to go up against me next time .
i promise .
you guys are out of your minds !
i'll drink to that !
by the way , next time you fight ... ... try to keep your clothes on .
anytime , anyplace , anywhere ... ... if you ever need me , i'll be there .
i love you , my friend .
me , too .
take care .
he's not going to show .
looks like he did it to us again , huh?
hey , guys !
you coming or what?
you son of a bitch .
you're always late !
you're really a pain in the ass , you know that?
i'm just glad you're on our side , kid .
