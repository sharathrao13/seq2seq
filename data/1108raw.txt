meanwhile the war has come to the kitchen .
housewives are showing the enemy what they're made of .
who would have guessed that a turnip could go so far .
german pocket battleships , scharnhorst and gneisenau are still dodging the allied bombing raids .
the atlantic won't be safe until they're beneath the waves !
as the prime minister boards one of our finest navel destroyers ,
winston churchill thanks the boys who have been keeping our convoys safe .
excuse me .
excuse me .
lord louis mountbatten salutes his heroes home .
following the bravery shown by his 'commandos ',
lord louis shakes the hands of the men who have shaken jerry rigid .
their raid on the western lsles of norway has been a triumph of military strategy .
one grenade in the right place and bang goes another jerry hq !
so watch out , adolf !
who knows where our boys will strike next .
by the right , quick march .
left , right , left , right , left , right , left , right ,
ieft , right ...
fighting a war means doing one's job and in the field of battle , gentlemen , every second counts .
one mistake or miscalculation and the results can be catastrophic .
let me tell you a story .
i was sitting in a shell hole , surrounded by the enemy , with not much left of the chap on my right .
the chap to the left was no better off .
sitting beside me was a young soldier screaming in agony .
never seen anything like it , rocking like a child , clutching his head , calling for his mother .
believe me , gentlemen , toothache in the field is no joke .
know what i did?
i made a stopper out of some brackish mud , a shell case from my 38 and a clove of garlic .
the chap was back in action in under two minutes and the enemy ran like buggery when they smelt him coming .
what we do here is frontline stuff .
alrcraft englnes
you've all seen the raf before and while they do their bit , we'll do ours with an impression tray , a clear head and poly pliers .

.. wouldn't you say , cuthbertson?
sir?
your war effort is here , private .
so let's not waste any time , alright .
an army marches on its stomach , cuthbertson and an army that can't bite is an army that can't fight .
what's an army that can't bite?
an army that can't fight , sir .
well , upward and onward , the use of china clay in the shade matching of dentures .

yes , sergeant . < you would have been on the pathe news then !
yes , sergeant .
our services are not required except for ... and exclusively for ... the pulling of teeth .
is that clear?
i just want to fight for my country , sergeant .
your country does not need you .
you've seen action , you know what it's like .
all i want is a posting , sergeant .
the army wants you to do what you're told .
i joined up to fight .
you joined up to follow orders like the rest of us .

sorry .
so put those in the bag .
i can't they're full ... of something else .

# when the twilight is gone

i will not have this behaviour in a time of war .
i want you to find them and throw the book at them .
is that clear?
yes , sir .
sir .
bloody side show .
# my prayer is to linger with you
# at the end of the day ...

they'll already be looking for us .
can i help?
we're looking for the harbour .
follow me , i'll show you .
that's a bit of luck .

where are you from?
i'm afraid i'm not allowed to say .
i meant where do you live?
oh , london .
it must be horrible with all those bombs .
yeah , you're better off staying down here .
two of our boys were killed by mines last week .
your friend isn't very happy .
no , well , he's a sergeant .
so?
they have their sense of humour removed at birth .
so where are you staying?
we haven't decided yet .
the pub has got rooms .
oh , right .
thanks very much .
that's alright .
bye .
er , which boat then , sergeant?
we need to get closer .
any of those will do .
we'll wait till it's dark and then requisition one .
mum says it's fine .
to anyone else we're booked up , but i won't have our brave boys going short .
i've got a nice double with a sea view .
if you'd like to step inside .
it's very kind of you .
don't you mention it .

fine and dandy , sir .
first class soldier , sir .

it's a good thing we got the room .
knocklng
mum says , 'how do you like your pilchards? '
we've had a lot of letters from listeners who advise cooking with steamers .
two pints of stout , brenda .
be with you in a minute .
more potatoes , private?
i'm fine thanks , mrs fraser .
are you sure the colonel doesn't want something on a tray?
he says he's not hungry .
better?

you smell like a damp dog .
i'm sorry about that .
i fell in the harbour .
it's alright .
i like dogs .
what were you doing in the harbour?
i'm afraid i can't tell you that .
you could be anyone .
you could be a spy .
that's right , i could .
walls have ears , don't they?
that's right they do .
is it very ... dangerous what you do?
oh , yes , very .
are you going somewhere dangerous now?
yeah .
you will be careful , won't you , leslie?
of course i will .
i'll be fine .
british commandos have seriously damaged the submarine pens and dry docks .
it will be months before st nazaire is operational again .
did he say st nazaire?
i'm not interested .
it's not my fault .
it will be high tide soon .
get out of here , get a boat and go .
we'll sleep during the day and travel by night .
the whole place will be crawling with men and machinery .
move !
there's a war on or had you forgotten?
travel by night ...
crawling with men and machinery .
leslie !
what are doing?
oh , for christ's sake , get her sorted out .
what are you doing?
you can't do that .
it's a secret mission .
you can't tell anyone .
i'll have to tell erin .
it's his boat .
we told him already .
cuthbertson !
i've got to go .
i'm sorry .
sorry .

potatoes are coming on well .
how are the garden room girls?
morning , major .
morning , arthur .
morning , sir .
what has our prime minister received today from the great unwashed?
nothing for the pm's eyes yet , major merton .
anything good in the 'potty pile ', daphne?
eight death threats , three requests to open air raid shelters , seven and six in postal orders and ... a cigar ... probably poisoned .
god bless the lunatics .
do you know that without them , this war could be quite serious .
were you ever married , sergeant?
what would i do that for?
did you ever ask anyone?
why do you want to know?
i'm only interested .
sorry .
gladys .
nurse gladys potter .

plumped up my pillow .
i asked her .

they're a bit stale .
no thank you .
so what did she say then , this gladys?
she said she spent too much of her life mending people , to spend the rest of it with someone who smashed them up !
that wasn't very nice of her .
she did me a favour .
phone rlngs

he hasn't left , major .

dlstant volces

down there somewhere , sir , some women are going on about a recipe .
what?

no , they're speaking english .
bugger !
welcome home , private .
how could that happen?
we would have known if we were going round in circles?
at least mohammed found the right sodding mountain !
at least we tried .
most people would have given up at cornwall !
this is bleedin 'cornwall !
we'll be a laughing stock .
we can explain , can't we?
we'll have to explain alright .
bloody court martial .
i don't mind dying , cuthbertson ... .. but i won't be humiliated .
what a complete bloody fiasco .
we've still got the boat .
i don't mind giving it another go .
do you want to give it another go?
then , there's half a leek , one teaspoon ...
have you got that?
half a leek , one teaspoon of mixed herbs and a teaspoonful of salt and then there's two ounces ...
psssst !
psssst !
ah !
sergeant?
was that you , sergeant?
what are you doing?
there's a german !
there's a german !
there's a sodding german !
run rabbit run
# run run run
# run rabbit run rabbit run run run
shall we go back and kill him?
i haven't come all this way to shoot a kraut who likes cooking !
he's probably gone by now anyway .
at least we're here , that's the main thing .
open wide , adolf ! the dentists are coming !
cuthbertson ! >
sorry , sergeant .
# so run rabbit run run run . #
you don't have to tell me if you don't want to .
if you must know ... .. it's cold , wet with more rats than you can shake a stick at .
blimey .
for 28 days you were bored to tears and then on the 29th boof !
the sky lit up , you got your head down , ran like the clappers and hoped some other poor bastard got it , not you .
now , go to sleep .
didn't you save the life of a general?
oh , yes ...
general sir william hyde .
i was his driver .
what happened?
nothing .
go to sleep .
my dad was in the trenches .
at amiens .
he was one of the lucky ones , he came home in one piece .
what are you doing?
tapping .
sorry .
it's a habit when i'm nervous .
well , stop it .
did he ... .. say much , your dad ... about the trenches?
my dad?
yeah .
i thought you wanted to go to sleep?
i do ... .. but i'd rather you talked than tapped .
not much .
he was killed by a tram when i was three so i never really knew him .
he was just a face at my bedroom door .
my mum always showed me pictures and i do think about him .
he tells me off in my head .
not always though .
sometimes i make him laugh .
can i ask you something?
what now?
why did you choose me?
who else would be daft enough to carry the grenades?
he would like this .
it would make him smile .
can you reach it?
i would if you stood still .
here .
here .
you do it .
it was your idea .
really?
thanks .
bloody hell?
how many of those buns did you eat?
how many shall i cut?
cut them all .
keep your voice down .
it's a lot harder than you think .
did you see that?
you could have your eye out with one of those .
i've got a good idea .
we'll make a list of the things we do and then keep it as proof .
we could tot up the damage .
how much are these lines worth?
five quid each?
well , that's one , two , three ... .. that's 25 quid the lot . < depends what's on the other end .
that's a point .
so , supposing these go to like , the hospital or the resistance even?
just suppose you get on with it .
still , 25 quid is 25 quid , isn't it?
well , it's not actually , it's only 20 .
what do you mean?
i left one .
what for?
in case of emergencies .
how much does cement cost?
what?
if we were blowing up a gun emplacement ...
i was trying to work out how much it's worth .
what for?
well ...
we put the damages on the left and what it's worth on the right .
are you a bloody accountant now?
no , listen .
i had a mate who bought a riley roadster before the war .
he polished it every sunday , but the birds kept crapping on the bonnet .
so , what he did was , he bought a garage .
the only problem is he reckons the garage cost more than the car .
has this got a point , private?
yeah , yeah , the point is ,
i reckon that two garages costs the same as one gun emplacement .
sergeant?
to put it another way , one gun emplacement costs the same as three riley roadsters .
you've got a head like a toy box , cuthbertson .
when are we going to eat?
hello?
hello?
hang on , sir .
africa , that's where we stand or fall .
he's on the line now .
about time .
put him through .
i want answers yesterday , merton .
lose africa and we lose the med .
hello?
no one here , faith .
one moment , prime minister . < he's on line three , prime minister .
hello , monty .
how are you , old cocker?
jolly good .
now tell me something , general ... .. what do your knees look like in shorts?
'sleep during the day , travel by night ', you said . >
that's alright .
so far , it hasn't been necessary .
'crawling with men and machinery '.
thanks , private .
all we need do is find a road or a signpost .
to where?
there's nothing to do .
it's not a problem .
there will be plenty to do when we get there . < get where?
there's no one around , the whole place is shut .
hello?
anyone?
we're here !
we've invaded !
shut up !
i'm starving .
i'm sergeant king , how do you do?
well , maybe we could get something to eat or something .
maybe we could steal a car .
oh , yes .
good idea
which one of the many fine vehicles would you care to requisition?
first rule of survival behind enemy lines : live off the land .
oh , i'm sorry .
oh ...
i l i'm english .
er ...

vivement la liberation !
i was only getting some food .
i don't know what the problem is .
you said get some food and i did .
anyone could have been in there .
the whole third reich could have been in there .
we should be so lucky .
what?
can we eat the pie now?
don't you get lippy with me , son !
i'll knock the living daylights out of you .
can we eat the pie now?
you've jeopardised this operation .
you've been like a kid on a school outing , buying buns , waving stockings about , cosying up to your little cornish pasty .
then when i send you to get some food , what do i find?
you canoodling up to some french tart , practically slipping her one .
piss off .
eh?
piss off !
don't tell me to piss off .
no !
everything you've asked , i've done .
every order you've given , i've followed .
where has it got us?
nowhere .
now , i'm a deserter .
i've nearly been drowned .
i'm tired and i'm hungry .
whether you like it or not , i'm going to eat this pie .
i can't believe you've done that .
no , i take that back .
i can believe it .
look at you .
you know why you're called the kaiser?
you're a jumped up , washed up , over the hill has been .
finished?
no !
you know what?
back home , you command about as much respect as a fly on dog shit !
smart arsed little turd !
i gave you a chance .
nobody else would be stupid enough to give you a gun , but i did .
i thought you had guts , but the only thing you're good at is whingeing .
it's a good thing your dad died when he did , so he never saw the whining tosspot that his son had become .
can you see anything?
nothing .
a sign or something?
no .
we've got to find out where we are .
i'll see what i can find .
i didn't mean ... .. what i said about your dad .
i'll stand guard then .
sergeant ...
they don't all call you the kaiser .
yes .
you stand guard .
yes , sergeant .
yes , sergeant .
buzzer

i l i'm sorry , sergeant .

it's full of bloody germans !
heh !

danke .
naechstes mal 'n bisschen schneller .
supplies .
what shall we do with him?
he'll tell someone he has seen us .
drunk in charge of a signal box .
they won't believe a word he says .
mind the string .
how much do you reckon a railway line's worth?
about 70 quid?
more .  80 .
put that away .

rumbllng
what was that?
what's wrong?
i think i heard something .
nah , it was nothing .
bloody hell !

# if that siegfried line's still there . #
let's find out where we are .
you've got the matches .
is that cheese off?
nah , it's french .
do you want some?
no , i want you to strike a match so i can see what i'm doing .
closer .
that's better .
now then , there's the railway line so we're ...
lancasters .
lucky buggers .
hold it still .
sitting down to bacon and eggs in half an hour .
you and your belly .
slren blares
oh , you're still here?
so are you .
we're all still here .
faith , you look terrible .
is he still here?
no .
he's meeting with the joint chiefs .
a chance to make a break for it .
oh , good luck .
thanks .
more light reading for you .
sorry about the cigar ash .
he was on one of his nocturnals again .
this belongs up here , i think .
how are we supposed to run a war when the prime minister keeps interfering .
nobody listens ! >
why won't the buggers listen?
faith .
oh , bad luck , faith .
10 feet short of the wire .
they look like teacups .
bloody big teacups .
what do you think?
nah .
too risky .
what's that fly swat thing?
fly swat?
looks like an aerial .
some sort of listening device .
that must be worth a fortune .
come on .
we wouldn't make it to the fence .
move .
well , it's just over there .
come on , it's crawling with bleedin 'germans .
of course it's crawling with germans , that's why we came .
i don't believe this .
you were going to blow up the scharnhorst with one grenade .
destroy st nazaire single handed .
we find one piddly observation post and you say it's too risky .
keep your voice down !
one hand grenade , you said .
we've got a bag of the bastards .
well , if you won't , i will .
you wouldn't last five minutes .
i'll be out in four then .
once it's dark and i'm inside ... .. i'll attach some grenades to the fly swat , move to the ops room with the remaining grenades , then up it goes .
wait .
where am l?
you're that pebble there .
what pebble?
by the fence , where we cut through .
what am i doing there?
standing guard .
i don't want to stand guard !
i didn't come here to stand guard .
i am giving you an order .
well , i'm disobeying it .
i'm younger and i'm faster and i want to blow up the fly swat .
you can't !
whoever goes in there is going to die !
then what's the point in standing guard?
here .
take the grenades .
blow your arse off .
you and your medal .
it's not that .
you can't stop being a hero .
i wasn't a hero .
don't give me that tosh . < it's not tosh .
i changed a tyre , that's all i did .
what?
i don't understand .
the general was in the back seat .
a bombardment went up .
a piece of shrapnel caught the front tyre and we got a puncture .
and?
general sir william hyde told me to get out and change it .
a shell exploded to the right of us , the jack slipped , the car fell on my foot .
i drove some 10 miles with a smashed heel .
so you were decorated for changing a tyre?
yes , i know ,
rac patrol men do it every day .
can we get on with the weapons check?
two revolvers ... .. and twenty rounds .
grenades?
five in the bag and five in the nylons .
did you see any more action?
i didn't .
i was invalidated out and joined the medical corps .
so you haven't done anything like this before .
well , i hate to say this , sergeant ... .. but i wish you hadn't told me that .
it's fine .
it's not a problem .
four for the fly swat and the rest for the ops room and no one stands guard .
agreed?
agreed .
hope you've got a handbag to go with them stockings?
alright?
yeah .
through you go .
wait !

sergeant mohammed , it's private mountain .
what kept you?
we did well .
keep your eyes on the road .
you driven one of these before?
it's not a problem .
we couldn't have done all that , could we?
let's get the hell out of here !
leslie !
sorry to trouble you .
i'm looking for a miss emma fraser .
now , africa is the absolute priority .
what the hell did i do with that thing?
i want to know everything that is going on out there .
when i say everything , i mean everything .
i don't want a camel to so much as break wind without it ending up on my desk .
here it is .
there , no it isn't .
what the hell is this?
not funny .
now , i don't want another shambles like singapore , gentlemen .
englne falters
hold up .
we're out of petrol .
cop hold of that oar , cuthbertson .
the oar?
are we going to row? !
no , we're going to knit a jumper .
it'll give you an appetite .
one , two , three .
he's depressed .
he won't get out of his cot .
have you tried clemmie?
she's dining with the archbishop .
he's an old man , he needs a holiday .
failing that , a victory .
anything .
something to lift his spirits .
good luck .
whose turn is it?
yours .
i sat with him last night  reading kipling .
why don't you go home , faith?
yes , i know ...
i look terrible .
i promised the king victory , merton .
gave my word to the country .
i don't know if i can do it .
well , would you like a whisky , sir?
no , merton , i don't want a whisky .
i want a wander .
i don't know if this rabbit is going to come out of the hat .
cuthbertson ... .. we've got company .
< come on .
it's bloody following us !
throw something !
i bet it's one of ours .
it can't be one of ours !
that's not fair .
not after what we've done !
come on !
blow , you sod !
wie heissen sie?

was tun sie hier?
sergeant king .
7 5 ... 3 6 ... 3 9 4 .
1 0 5 1 1 4 3 6 .
private cuthbertson .
we're dentists .
have we got the girl?
she's on her way .
is there any tea in this pot?
stewed , i'm afraid .
right .
yes , that's leslie .
are you sure?
positive .
where were they?
reconnaissance spotted them in the channel .
floating on some wood .
that was lucky .
that depends on how you look at it .
we don't take too kindly to spies .
spies?
yes .
or deserters .
don't worry .
we'll find out soon enough .
out !
prisoner escort .
attention !
quick march !
no , he said that he had to do something dangerous .
he couldn't talk about it as it was secret and i might be a spy .
so i know they're not spies because they borrowed a boat and said they were going somewhere ... .. which must have been france which is where the war is , so they can't be deserters either .
sorry , do i sound a bit muddled?
not at all .
thank you , miss fraser .
you may sit down .
well , gentlemen ...
let me tell you , i've presided over many court martials , too many if i'm honest , and i's not a task i relish .
never before have i been asked to listen to such appalling drivel .
you're deserters .
you know it , i know it , everyone in this room knows it .
you ran away for a coward's chance on easy street and when your boat sank on the way to lreland ... .. you invented this fairy tale to save yourselves .
what sticks in my throat above all , is that even after you failed to produce evidence in your defence , you still persist in this ridiculous 'boy's own 'adventure of some personal invasion of france .
you have brought shame on the uniform worn so bravely by so many .
you , sergeant king , you're beyond contempt , frankly .
not only have you duped an impressionable ...
begging the court's pardon , sir .
who is this?
what does he want?
i'm so sorry , colonel , but er ... .. if i might crave the court's indulgence for a few moments?
who are you?
i want to interview the prisoners .
what?
i'm major desmond merton .
chief lntelligence advisor to mr churchill .
now , i have here ... .. a ground plan ... of some buildings .
major , these are official proceedings . >
these buildings that you see here , gentlemen ... .. do you know what they are?
yes , sir .
it's a listening post , sir .
a 'cap de la hague ', sir .
interesting .
how do you know?
it says so at the top , sir .
does it?
oh , so it does .
major ...
one moment , please , colonel .
are you familiar with these buildings?
yes , sir .
i think so .
what can you tell me about them?
well , that's the fly swat thing , sir .
the ... the what?
the signal receiver thing , sir .
it appeared to the uninitiated eye to be a giant implement for the swatting of flies .
i see .
what about these chaps here?
they're the two teacup things , sir .
they had the general appearance of teacups placed on their side , sir .
they were outside the perimeter , so we left them alone .
excellent .
right .
now what was it that you did?
blew up the ops room , with grenades .
major ...
they are disgraced .
they're guilty of theft , deceit and desertion .
you're not suggesting there's any substance to their story?
i'm merely trying to ascertain the facts .
this operations room .
did anything strike you as unusual about it?
no , nothing , sir .
apart from the smell .
the smell .
the smell?
what smell?
er , beef and onions , sir .
beef and onions?
burned beef and onions .
major , i really must insist ...
burned beef and onions !
ah !
thank you , colonel .
i've heard all i need to hear .
well , thank god for that .
in your opinion , major , are they telling the truth?
no , sir .
they are not .
they didn't destroy the operations room .
they destroyed the cookhouse .
laughter
i'm not putting up with this .
unless you can substantiate that claim , i intend to pass sentence .
i'm sure that i can , colonel .
how?
you're not going to tell me you were there?
not personally , no , sir , but the 2nd parachute regiment were .
the paras where there?
119 of them to be exact .
there were after those two teacup things , which you were good enough not to blow up .
their task was to bring bits home for our boffins to play about with .
there were reports of an unexpected and very useful diversion ... .. but until now , no one has been able to confirm it .
initially , we put it down to the french , but it just didn't tally .
anyway , there we are .
well done , gents .
thank you , colonel for allowing me to clear up that little puzzle .
oh , yes , and i nearly forgot .
message from the prime minister .
he thanks you very much for your letter .
it cheered him up no end .
he apologies for the delay in replying , but he has had rather a lot on .
next time you're in whitehall , he would be delighted to see you for a cup of tea .
that is tea for king and cuthbertson , sir , not ...
well ...
oh , yes ...
here are your pay books back ... .. which he has signed .
he didn't want you to go short .
as he said to me ...
a few more lunatics like those dentists , merton , and i can win this war by christmas .
cookhouse .
the bloody cookhouse .
well done , lads !
i'll see you in 28 days , sergeant .
i'll be here , private .
