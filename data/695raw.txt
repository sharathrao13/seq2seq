what you're doing up there in the infirmary , what it's got to do with what we're doing here?
four days from now , on the night of the escape , we'll have 18 minutes to get the bars off the infirmary window , and for all seven of us to get across the wire and over the wall .
is that doable?
of course .
maricruz , it's me .
baby , what the hell is going on?
well , hector says that you can serve your full sentence .
what are you doing here?
where's maricruz?
she's not gonna be coming around here anymore .
this is a joke , right?
she's with me now .
i just need to know what michael scofield wanted from you in exchange for the green card .
why would you need a credit card in prison?
if i'd have known that this is how this whole thing was gonna turn out ,
i'd have gotten some crap job with the feds .
keep talking like that , i'm gonna be forced to put a bullet in your head .
i need to get out while i still got my life .
daddy !
daddy !
things have changed .
i want in .
what's up?
we've got too many people .
i've done the math , and one of them has to go .
sorry to keep you waiting .
oh , it's , uh , not a problem .
hmm .
impressive resume .
thank you .
tell me why you chose to pursue a career in engineering .
well , um ,
i've always been interested in , uh , structure , geometry .
how things fit together .
how an object that , uh , performs a function can ... also be a work of art .
what about the future?
where do you see yourself in five years?
one suit , black .
that baby boy all growed up yet?
oh , he's gonna raise hell the next few years .
take after his mama .
yeah , you know , it's the same old same up here .
but , uh ... things are getting pretty tense ,
like they're fixin 'to , uh , collide .
you know what i mean , jimmy?
there's a potential , uh , situation .
i found our access to the infirmary building , but i'm gonna need some time to make it work .
how much time?
enough for me to find my way up a 20 foot vertical drain pipe without using a ladder .
i'll probably need to skip pi tomorrow if i want to get this thing done .
can't just skip it .
it ain't class .
what if one of the bulls decide to drop in?
well , i don't have a choice , do i?
once we get through the pipe below the guards 'room , it will be a whole lot easier .
i can come and go without using the door , and with westmoreland as a lookout , we'll have one more man available for dig .
westmoreland's gonna be a problem .
all seven of us can't break over that wall in 18 minutes .
you said it yourself : it's impossible .
listen , man , i'm telling you , one of us has got to take a hike .
i know .
mind if i share that with the rest of the class?
apparently , college boy here did the math .
figured out that we got too many clowns in the car .
so , one of us is in here digging , but his seat ain't guaranteed .
how is this your problem , man?
he doesn't know what he's talking about .
i'm not gonna dig if i'm not gonna go .
we need to make a decision on who gets cut .
well , i think we can all agree who that should be .
right?
oh , pardon me for interrupting .
but , uh ... what's that smell?
it smells a little like ... conspiracy .
we need to get back to work .
yeah , before you do , i have an announcement to make .
i've been growing leery of the way y'all talk , like i'm a lesser man .
so , i bought an insurance policy .
i called up my guy on the outside , and i told him about our plan .
and i told him , in all likelihood , i'll be seeing him next week , but ... if he don't hear from me five minutes before the escape , and 20 minutes after ,
i told him to call up the warden , blow the whistle on the whole thing .
so if you all got ideas about getting rid of me ...
i suggest you make other plans .
son of a bitch has got a countermove for everything .
not for this .
odd men out me and you .
what do you mean?
look who you're walking with right now .
you should be up there , calling the shots with the rest of the suits .
yeah .
so?
so?
scofield is only here for one reason : his brother .
and he only needs two things : the old man's money , and the mob boss's plane .
he don't need you .
you just happened to be in the same cell when he got here .
you and the toilet .
i've done a lot of work on this thing .
exactly , and me , too .
yeah , we're just the damn laborers on this thing , man .
and the night that fish goes into that hole , you think he wants to carry all that extra baggage?
'cause that's all we are .
i don't know about you , but i'm going .
how much does he tell you , anyways?
or does he keep it all to himself?
yeah , he probably tells you , the less you know , the better , right?
you don't know what you're talking about .
he tells me everything .
if he tells you everything , then you don't need him .
now , we can go by ourselves , me and you .
or , you know , you can wait and see if scofield really wants to carry heavy weight .
it's up to you , popi .
yo , i still waitin '.
what for?
i swiped you that watch , man .
where's my pl?
that's not gonna happen .
you promised .
i said i'd think about it .
maybe somewhere down the road .
yeah .
ain't gonna hold my breath .
what do you want me to do?
get somebody !
now !
no , no , no !
no , they see a bullet , they're gonna call the cops .
we don't have a choice , okay?
i'm not gonna let you die .
find it , find it !
find it !
what?
the bullet just find it and dig it out .
i can't .
do it !
where's scofield?
there you are .
i just looked for you in your cell .
couldn't find you anyplace .
i couldn't find your credit card , either .
you know the one i'm talking about .
the one your whore wife trunked in the other day .
she told me all about it .
maybe whore's too strong .
what do you call a girl who married a felon to get into the united states?
why'd she have to come here for , anyway?
no strip clubs in whazistan?
officer bellick .
captain .
fine .
do you mind conducting your inquisitions on your own time , please?
i have a schedule to maintain .
excuse me , doctor .
i was just asking mr.
scofield about the contraband he had his stripper wife trunk in the other day .
but you go ahead .
your job's more important .
he's had it out for me since the day i got here .
hold still , please .
sorry .
i only married her ... so she could get her green card .
i saw you coming out of the conjugal room .
that's just business .
you don't have to explain it to me , michael .
i know .
but i want to .
d. b.?
oh , is that who you is now?
i thought you was just a cowboy .
take a couple of steps back , boy .
you know what i can't understand is , why somebody like you wants to get out of here anyway .
how you going to survive , huh?
the world's all different now .
it's scary ...
they got computer phones , boobies made out of silicone .
you wouldn't know what to do .
i don't have to justify myself to you .
oh , you're going to have to .
them old bones just going to be dragging us down .
maybe i'll just snap a few of 'em right now .
take your best shot .
hey , break it up down there !
bow out , cowboy .
i'm not going to warn you no more .
what's up?
records from the phone in the yard .
james bagwell .
lives down in gary .
t bag's insurance policy?
yeah .
my guy's going to lock him up in a moving van for a couple days until we're in the clear .
moving van?
yeah .
don't worry , he can breathe and all .
we do it all the time .
what about t bag?
he's no longer a threat .
trust me .
you james bagwell?
got a delivery for you .
yeah?
yeah .
you all right?
yeah .
ma'am?
yes?
can i speak with you , please?
of course .
you stay right here , okay?
is he going to be okay?
we don't know yet .
he's lost a lot of blood .
i was going to call the police , but i wanted to speak to you first .
his wound is obviously the product of a gunshot .
you need to be honest with me .
what was he doing when he got shot?
he was in the garage , underneath his car .
he's in surgery right now .
the blood loss has caused his muscle tissue to suffer from a lack of oxygen .
he's also sustained a fair amount of damage to his shoulder , and with a bullet there's always an increased risk of infection .
so , he's going to have to be admitted .
is there anyone you should call?
any family?
no .
it's just me .
all right , well ...
i'll let you know as soon as he's in recovery .
thank you .
yeah .
are you there yet?
almost .
you remember , be patient .
follow his lead .
we want the trifecta today .
yeah , i'm on it .
it's me .
yeah .
i got some bad news .
yeah , like what?
the job you ordered went bad .
the guy was a paranoid , he had a gun ... one thing led to another .
what , he's dead?
yeah .
and , unfortunately ... there was a kid there .
what are you ...
what are you talking about?
you killed a kid?
it was unintentional .
it's a kid , man .
i know , i'm sorry .
sob used him as a shield .
a boy or a girl?
i don't know .
boy .
how old?
four , maybe five .
who's here to see me?
hell if i know .
some lady .
baby .
hi .
you look so beautiful .
i came here cause i have to tell you something .
what?
i'm pregnant , fernando .
pregnant?
with your baby .
i'm going to have your son .
you ... you're going to ...
we ...
we're going to have a baby?
oh , yeah , papi , you hear that?
i'm going to be a dad !
i'm not finished !
what , mami , what?
okay , hector ... he asked me to marry him .
what?
look , it's crazy , i know .
well , tell him no .
tell him you're having my son .
we're going to be a family .
fernando ...
look , my mom , she says ... that having a baby is the hardest job in the whole world .
and it's even harder if i do this by myself .
but all i know is is i'm really scared .
i'm really scared to do this alone .
you're not going to have to .
well , i haven't told him no yet .
wait , wait .
you're not actually considering this .
oh , baby ...
i don't know .
i don't know .
oh , my god , baby , you got to stop listening to these people .
they're poisoning your brain .
your hormone things they're out of whack .
you're not thinking straight .
this is our child we're talking about .
i want you to listen to me .
i want you to wait .
i'm going to be out .
sooner than you think .
you keep on telling me that .
all right , visiting time is up .
let's go .
tell me you're going to wait .
hands off , sucre !
you're all i got left in the world , baby .
please .
i love you .
but you'll learn to love again , right?
tell me you're going to tell him no , honey .
i don't know .
i don't know anything any more .
sucre .
come on .
the kid's here .
perfect .
follow him back to the lawyers and call me back .
where are you going?
i'll be back in ten minutes .
what do you have to do?
it's complicated .
i can't explain .
but if it works ... you'll see soon enough .
i want to go with you .
i want to see now .
someone has to stay here .
i need a lookout .
i'm always on lookout .
you're my cellmate .
who else is going to do it?
i'll be back in ten minutes , okay?
okay .
we're all lined up for tomorrow .
where do you want him?
john?
tomorrow .
where do you want t bag : in the shop or the shed?
shh ...
i don't care .
you decide .
thank god .
are you okay?
yeah , i'm okay .
she didn't do anything .
she didn't deserve this .
i know .
here you go , man .
yeah , yeah .
these were seriously hard to get .
what you need them for anyway?
none of your business .
thank you for waiting , theodore .
i don't mean to deny your time in the yard .
what's this all about?
i , uh ...
i'm afraid i have some terrible news .
you cousin james was shot and killed in his home yesterday .
his son , james junior was killed , as well .
i'm very , very sorry .
what does it mean?
am i chosen?
or what?
often , the lord appears when you're in particular need of forgiveness .
maybe that's what's happening right now .
john , it's never too late .
if you agree to accept christ into your heart and turn from your sin , he will forgive you and save you in eternity .
do you agree?
revelation chapter three .
jesus said , " behold , i stand at the door and knock .
if any man hear my voice and open the door ,
i will come into him .
he got to the infirmary building last night .
through the old sewer pipe .
it's the same pipe that runs under the guards 'room .
that's all i know .
that's the little thumb sucker that swiped my watch .
who?
tweener?
solid gold .
took it right off my arm .
it was a half hour before i even noticed it .
whose was it in the first place?
i don't care that you stole it .
you can tell me .
michael scofield .
what are you looking at?
i'll be right around the corner .
westmoreland !
you scared me , boss .
get back to work .
all right , let's go !
move it , scofield .
as for me , i will call upon god , and the lord shall save me .
i cry aloud , and he'll hear my voice .
he shall hear my voice .
he shall hear my voice .
he shall hear my voice .
he shall hear my voice .
what are you doing?
nothing .
well , keep an eye on the tier for me , will you?
when are we getting out of here exactly?
i need to know the time .
as soon as possible .
as soon as possible " is not a specific time .
you tell abruzzi the time?
yes , because he needs to know .
why does he need to know and i don't?
because he's arranging the plane .
why the sudden curiosity?
why would you want to be responsible for potentially dangerous information?
the less you know , the better .
it's for your own good .
i have to go .
i'll meet you in pl .
stealing from a guard .
you can get thrown in the shu for that , maybe even add a few years to your bid .
i don't know ...
don't deny it .
i already know it's true .
lucky for you , i got pull some around here .
i can make this sort of thing go away , like it never even happened .
mmm .
that's good .
now ...
i'm sure you've heard the word " rat .
i don't like it .
snitch , " neither .
those sort of words aren't appropriate for what i need from you .
what i need is a little information .
like when you're hanging out with scofield ... ... just come back and tell me what he said .
i got an extra burger .
but , man , i'm full .
what do you say , kiddo?
you want a cheeseburger ... or do you want to go to the shu?
that's my boy .
hey , honey , what are you doing here?
i thought you left .
what's wrong?
i , um ...
i've been thinking .
i think we need to make a change .
what are you talking about?
remember when we first got married , and we thought about moving out west?
yeah , we were 22 .
well , maybe we should give it a shot .
it's not too late .
i don't understand .
what brought this on?
it's just work .
i'm tired of being on the road and working for somebody else , while you sit at home all alone , night after night .
i want our lives to be about us .
i do , too , but there's so much to think about , like the kids and the house .
we got to go .
you're in trouble , aren't you?
oh .
the crowd has thinned out in here .
how you doing , sucre?
almost got it .
switch me out .
you're up , then westmoreland .
we got to get through .
michael's gonna be coming back this way .
hello?
veronica donovan?
who is this?
it , it doesn't matter who i am .
don't hang up .
i have information that you may be interested in information that will lead to the exoneration of lincoln burrows .
what?
what is it?
i can't tell you that now .
meet me tonight at the highland cafe on kennedy avenue .
this isn't a trap .
i will tell you everything you need to know .
highland cafe , 8 : 00 p . m .
all right , that's enough .
leave us alone .
you sure?
get out of here .
you don't have to do this .
you don't have to do this .
you don't have to do this .
you brought it on yourself .
i'm just an emissary for all the pain and suffering you caused , all the families you ruined , all the kids .
what about jimmy?
he had nothing to do with this .
you didn't need to kill him .
and what about his beautiful son?
he had his whole life in front of him .
you didn't need to kill a beautiful child .
after all i've done , maybe i do deserve to die , maybe i do .
but you are no better than me .
but i can be , if i want .
god has given me the chance to choose .
maybe i should give you a chance as well .
yes , anything , anything , please .
please .
please .
back out .
of the escape?
or die .
i would , i ...
i wouldn't make it out there , anyway not with my proclivities .
i want you to give me your word .
you hear me?
i want you to give me your word !
yeah , you got it , john .
you got it .
come on , you got it .
please .
swear .
i'm out , i swear !
i swear to god !
i'm out , okay , i sw ...
all right .
all right !
i have forgiven you .
i have forgiven you .
you just have to pray that the lord jesus christ will do the same .
hey , john , you know , actually , about jesus ...
say hi to him for me , will you?
i'm through .
keep it up .
come on , stomp it .
bulls .
you got to stall them .
we're not ready .
hey , boss .
what you doing out here , linc?
taking a break .
got to check the status in there .
it's all good .
then you won't mind me checking it out .
hey .
what the hell's your problem , con?
hey , hey !

get off him !
thanks .
