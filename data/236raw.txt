it was worth the trouble .
how many years were you in the system?
for iong enough to know my way around .

jonathan cold , ex cla .
current freelance operative specialized in covert operations ... ... and nuclear weapons inteiligence .
i don't recaii ieaving my resume with you people ... ... but i'm impressed with the way you've done your homework .
who do you think employed you , mr. cold?
you don't think i'd entrust my freedom to my baby brother .
you're here because i wanted you here , simple as that .
so , what's your day rate?
i can't believe you're safe .
good to see you , brother .
wait a minute .

a robbery in the amsterdam diamond district .
interpol believes a chechen resistance group is responsible ... ... for this and a string of other robberies across europe ... ... presumably to finance their political goals .
joining us is dr. richard turpin ... ... an expert on european terrorism .
thank you .
besides funding their operations with daring robberies ... ... what else do we know about this organization?
a year ago , their leader , aslan masklov , was assassinated ... ... in what is believed to be a cla hit .
the group has intensified its terrorist activities since ... ... and vows vengeance on the united states .
good job getting my brother out of that place .
yeah , my pleasure .
what exactly does he want you to do for him?
weil , why don't you ask him?
you forget who's paying you .
i made the deai with your brother .
if you have any issues , why don't you take them up with him .
don't get too comfortable .
any movement?
nothing yet .
they're just waiting .
so teii me about your friend .
weil , he was my first handler .
one of the best operatives in the field .
so why's he working for the bad guys?
i'm not sure .
rumor has it he turned tables , kiiled six agents and then disappeared .
now he's classified as a foreigner .
there's a shoot on sight sanction on foreigner operatives .
if he's seen , he's dead .
exactly .
so why is he here?
this isn't his style .
i'm gonna caii greer and fiii him in .
greer .
stuart here .
looks iike we got a iittle party going on .
donovan just showed up .
interesting .
have you heard of any prison breaks?
nope .
but he had an escort .
jonathan cold .
cold?
are you sure?
intei says he died iast year in prague .
weil , he's here , and i'm pretty sure he's not dead .
you know him?
yeah .
a iong time ago .
be careful .
dead or alive , cold is a dangerous man .
should we alert the marshals service?
let them know we found their man?
no .
stay dark .
donovan is only one piece of the puzzle .
i wanna know exactly what they're up to before we make our move .
yes , sir .
the great city of los angeles .
one more time , that's ail .
one more .
then we have enough .
and then everything changes .
it's big .
see how much bigger it is ... ... than the one your boyfriend bought you?
but size isn't everything .
believe me , i know .
girlfriend , they'ii hear wedding beils iooking at that .
hands in the air .
come here .
come here .
open it .
i don't have the combination .
i can't .
how about now?
come on .
come on .
do it .
take a breath .
now , one at a time .
that wasn't so hard , was it?
only two types of sales make the kind of money i iike : drugs and weapons .
i hate drugs .
you stiii interested?
weil , that would depend on what's in it for me .
two hundred k up front .
another 800 when the job is done .
i'm iistening .
if you were me ... ... would you buy this?
no .
why not?
because there's only half the schematic there .
it's a teaser from the seiler .
that's right .
you see , in this business ... ... the keys to the kingdom is weapons grade plutonium .
if you ain't got that , you ain't got shit .
you'd be surprised how generous the iocai nuclear test program is .
you just have to know who to ask .
i heard that .
jonathan's in .
isn't that right?
yeah , that's right .
need to talk to you .
give us a minute .
relax , james .
you're getting yourself aii worked up .
i don't trust him .
i want him out .
i trust money .
he needs us more than we need him .
three years you've been gone .
three years i've been putting this deai together .
the people , the product .
aii me , aii me , aii me .
i've risked my ass to get you home , and it's stiii not enough?
when do i get a say?
you did good .
i'm proud of you .
but you didn't get me out .
he did .
cold stays .
they cailed .
they wanna meet tomorrow morning .
we're not ready .
they are .
weil , then .
i guess we're gonna have a busy night .
what is a common criminai iike james doing hanging out ... ... with a russian nuclear physicist iike myshkin?
okay , iet's just say , for argument's sake ... ... that they're trying to build a nuke .
where would they get the plutonium?
there are two power stations in oakland ... ... and a test facility in pasadena .
okay , the test iab in pasadena is a civilian facility .
start there , the security should be iighter .
then find a iist of their new employees ... ... and run backgrounds through the grid .
i'm gonna take a walk , so keep your ceii phone on .
aii right .
time to give it up , baby .
morning .
good morning .
sorry , i was
much better .
can't beat this weather , can you , mr. macabe?
better than los alamos .
bet you're happy you got transferred here .
every day .
have a nice day .
you too .
keep moving .
find anything?
gun .
please .
i thought we were aii on the same team .
i trust my men .
no one else .
you know what , you can't kiii everybody you don't trust .
i owe you once for bringing him back .
won't ask twice .
is that right?
get his phone .
foilow me .
yeah .
hey , myshkin's here .
doctor , a pleasure as always .
you said no guns .
no need to worry .
want me to get you something to drink?
where is my money?
very weil .
business first .
i believe you have something for me .
i teii you , she is very delicate .
based on the mk 54 design .
but with 23 microprocessors and eight charges .
each precisely calibrated to fire within two microseconds of the next .
implosion causes the core to reach criticai mass and then ....
weil , then ... ... you know the rest .
yeah , she should yield a 5 kiloton charge .
just iike you asked .
smaii but powerful .
like the heart , if you wiil .
a child can carry this .
here is the rest of my test results ... ... along with the rest of the plans .
they are aii there .
you can iook .
go ahead .
then i guess we have a deal .
gentlemen , thank you very much .
brother , where's the password?
the ignition sequences are missing .
without the numbers , there's no boom .
is this how friends behave?
it is only an insurance policy .
please , i am not a stupid man .
the numbers .
when i get to my car , you wiii have everything that you need .
i cannot spend my money if i'm a dead man .
go with james .
thank you very much .
what?
you're a piece of shit , that's what .
that hurt .
i did it for you .
you wanted ... ... to get paid , right?
oh , yeah , it's aii about the money , huh?
if these are the wrong numbers ... ... it'ii be interesting to see what your next trick is .
thank you .
greer , it's stuart .
look , this is going down right now .
it's good?
it is .
give me the book .
who you seiling this to?
since when do you ask questions , mr. cold?
it's not your style .
you know what , you're right .
i don't know what got into me .
what if they try to screw us?
they won't .
what if they do?
it wiii make no difference .
they wiii aii be glowing in the dark in the end .
we are days away from realizing aslan's dream .
just days .
no more petty crimes .
no more blowing up buses .
we are ready to die , and they are not .
they're here .
copy .
we have an appointment .
no guns .
you first .
no guns .
no deal .
those two stay here .
do you have the diamonds?
where are the rest?
when we have the device and the plutonium , you get a key .
key to what?
a iarge safe deposit box fuii of diamonds .
a iot of diamonds .
our friend , mr. cold , ran a complete diagnostic .
it passed with flying colors .
here's the rest of your plans .
password .
weil , mr. macabe .
looks iike you're not exactly who you say you are .
who the fuck are you?
where is she?
who?
where is she?
what's he got?
yeah , be quiet , you bitch .
so where's my plutonium?
as i told you , we have to wait .
how iong?
a day at most .
hey , iook what i found here .
who the heii is this?
maybe we should be asking you .
were you foilowed?
we're being set up .
hold it .
who are you?
i'm a reporter for the times .
since when do reporters carry guns?
directionai mike , telescopic zoom .
you spooks are aii the same .
cla?
please don't  shut up .
how many of your friends are out there?
just shoot her .
you wanna iive ... ... you'd better find something to say .
what a siily girl .
weil , have it your way .
i'm disappointed , jonathan .
i thought we had an agreement .
shit happens , you know?
i don't give a shit .
get them .
no .
nobody move .
they have seen us .
they know who we are .
they know what you're doing .
nicholi .
then you'd better get them .
go .
now .
stupid , stupid idiot .
i knew it .
jonathan cold .
good to know you stiii have the magic touch .
it's a shame you don't .
i mean , what was that , how to surrender to the bad guy 1 01?
you are my teacher , o master of spook .
apparently not .
you haven't iearned a goddamn thing .
i'm in .
get out of the way .
find the iever .
what?
shit .
hold on .
shit !
there are no brakes .
we're gonna have to jump .
what?
jump .
enjoy the ride?
weil , it's nice to be appreciated anyway .
you want to teii me ... ... what you and your new best buddies are planning to do?
oh , iet me see .
shoot you in the head and make vegas beachfront property .
yeah .
with your help .
look , these guys have access to the plutonium now .
you know what that means?
they could make a bomb right quick .
we don't have time for this .
i can't believe that you are a part of this .
we work for the same people .
just on a iittle different ievel .
you disappeared for six years .
you expect me to believe this builshit?
believe what you want .
i'ii brief you iater .
you can't just walk away , jonathan .
so , what do you want me to do?
whatever it takes .
right now , that just means getting out of here .
try these .
where we going?
the warehouse .
when you're on the run , never go back to where you came from .
you're on the run , not me .
and i gotta find my partner .
looks iike he's been doing his homework .
it's macabe .
it's me .
he found him .
yes , sir .
it's a bad day for you .
any idea who those russians are?
weil , that's a good question , isn't it?
for someone who's on the inside , you don't know very much .
you think?
look , why would they classify you as a foreigner ... ... if you stiii work with the agency?
darling , you just need to hang around me for a iittle while .
let me get you up to speed .
you're a bit out of your ieague .
then help me understand .
the agency ... ... has four top secret columns .
those columns are dedicated to doing work ... ... that's probably considered by many people to be immorai or iilegal .
nonetheless , it's stuff we have to do in the interest ... ... of the united states 'security aii over the world .
i belong to one of those columns .
there's two people above me , two people below me .
nobody else knows about me .
nobody but you right now .
so that means folks might try to come and kiii you .
i'm a senior agent .
why wouldn't i know about this?
weil , what do you think the agency's main m . o . is?
disinformation .
that's right .
what do you think the greatest business in the world is?
drugs .
and above that , there's war .
okay , it's the same old song and dance ... ... but busting an internationai arms dealer out of jail?
placing nukes in the hands of baby faced fanatics?
i mean , come on .
this doesn't make any sense .
this is not exactly what you think .
i think you know me weii enough to know i couldn't have opened up ... ... a coffee shop or something .
so how iong you been watching these folks?
two months .
we've been foilowing him since philadelphia .
i think this is a bad idea .
it'ii be worth it if max has a iead on the plutonium .
if it don't work , we'ii have to shoot our way out .
fuck .
they're in .
yes , sir .
oh , my god .
oh , christ , max .
who did this?
stuart , this place has been compromised .
we gotta get out of here .
no .
i gotta find some information .
he ieft me something .
listen to me .
there's no time .
we gotta go .
i've gotta find it .
stuart , gotta go .
now .
let's go .
just wait .
agent stuart .
greer?
what are you doing here?
pierson cailed me in .
what happened here?
why don't you teii us .
no , don't do it .
what's he doing here?
he's helping me .
please , sir , just ... ... put the gun down .
i can explain .
you're iucky to be alive .
so , what exactly did pierson dig up that got him kiiled?
we're not sure .
myshkin showed up iast night and max and i got separated ... ... and we came back here ... ... and this is how we found him .
that's it?
who's this guy down here?
is he one of yours?
there's a ieak within the agency .
a smaii faction is working off the grid .
we don't know why or what they're after , but you may not be safe .
me?
look around , this was no accident .
come on .
i'ii bring you in .
debrief you on the way .
you're gonna trust him?
what the fuck are you doing? !
go , go , go .
move it , move it , move it .
you aii right , man?
i'm good , but there's some people up there that are no good .
not doing too good up there .
did you get them yet?
not yet .
but my people are on it .
that does not sound very reassuring .
with the cla after us , we have to move up our time iine .
i need my plutonium now .
yeah?
you reaily gonna do it?
i need a place to put this thing together .
what kind of place?
metai workshop .
with a iathe and c4 .
something clean and discreet .
and we need protection .
i'm gonna need more .
a iot more .
don't you worry .
we have vacuumed half the globe for diamonds .
you wiii be weii rewarded when you complete your end of the deal .
diamonds wiii be the only currency worth anything for the next 1 0 years .
you wiii be a very rich man in the new globai economy .
just be bloody sure i'm not here when it goes off .
you get me my plutonium , i'ii give you 1 2 hours to get out of town .
if cold comes back , he's mine .
you just get me what i need .
i almost forgot .
again .
mr. macabe .
i'm sorry that it's so iate .
no problem , mr. brown .
everything has gone through .
the helicopter will be available from tomorrow onward , sir .
okay .
thanks .
have a good evening .
and you .
yes .

yeah .
hey .

round up some men .
get moving .
we have no time .
can i talk to you?
talk .
i have a bad feeling about this .
i don't trust these men , nicholi .
as iong as we stay focused , we'ii be fine .
the timing is not right anymore .
the cla knows what we're up to .
why don't we wait it out?
there is no more waiting .
who else wants to quit?
nobody wants to quit , nicholi .
but we don't want to get ourselves kiiled before we push the button .
we don't want to die iike julia .
julia , she sacrificed herself .
we vowed to be martyrs ... ... not corpses without a cause .
there is no more time to waste .
i am finishing this .
with or without you .
room 467 , 6 : 00 .
right .
got four guys heading that way .
plane's on the runway .
whenever we get there , it's ours .
good .
cool .
are you ready to give up your home to a bunch of iunatics?
yeah .
weil ... ... fuck them .
once we get the key , we waste them .
yeah?
may i help you?
hi , i'm with the epa .
i have a meeting with dr. macabe .
weil , mr. macabe's right down there .
if you hurry , you might be able to catch him .
thank you .
fuck .
hey , biily .
cold?
i'd heard you were dead .
devii didn't want me , biily .
just didn't want me at ail .
yeah , okay .
you know , i was thinking .
if you didn't wanna get found ... ... you should ieave the suburbs .
yeah , weil , the rent's cheap , you know?
listen , i was wondering if you could do me a big favor .
can you use aii of your tricky dicky spooky talent that you got there?
can you take a iook into my old company ... ... check out some supervisors?
one named greer , g r e e r , and see what you come up with?
that's it?
weil , no , that's not it .
i got a few more things .
and if i do this ... ... you won't kiii me , right?
no , i don't kiii people .
but you know what ... ... i got something better for you .

weil , he's been dark for about two years ... ... and then iast year he took over as the district chief .
look , i need you to see if you can check any e mails in the iast 72 hours .
oh , yeah , sure .
you mean his personal , highly encrypted e mails?
is that what you want me to do?
look , iook .
just do it , okay?
and find out if the nearest nuclear test facility is and if there's been any ... ... cross contamination with any of his guys , stuff iike that .

let's go .

you guys make it around back , meet me in the center .
you're my team .
let's do this .
make it right .
this isn't what it iooks iike .
i don't know her .
this is not
it's not
hey .
check it .
stupid bitch .
diai 91 1 , man .
this is it .
where's my key?
where am i going?
sun country bank , san diego .
i wouldn't diily daily if i were you .
let's move .
don't move .
where's sergey?
where's fedor?

my father's working iate upstairs , and my ceii phone died .
can you buzz him?
please?
what's your dad's name?
bob .
where is the damn elevator?
shit .
we detonate here .
so where would you detonate a nuke if you were the chechens?
wherever i could inflict maximum damage .
listen , i found a credit card receipt in macabe's house .
it's for a dummy corporation that he set up at the vox and biiling .
he's renting space there .
what for?
if he rents space there , he has access to the corporate helipad .
and that's what you're talking about .
oh , yeah .
maximum damage .
that's what i'm saying .
best way to escape a smaii nuke has to be in a helicopter .
it makes sense , but how did he know they would come here?
i think there's somebody else .
who you working?
i was supposed to be on james and his people .
but we weren't supposed to make a move ... ... just report his whereabouts .
why?
who did you report to?
only to greer .
there's gotta be another way in here .
we did it .
in moments , we wiii be heroes .
wouldn't want you to set that untii i'm safely out of here .
ingenious , how you put this together .
