you needed a second sacrifice to claim another reward to bring you within 10 paces
although broken sword and flying snow had never met sky they instantly understood the reason for his defeat
how far am i from the bookshelves?
about 10 paces 10 paces is fine
i need one of you to help me
please decide between yourselves
meet me at the qin camp tomorrow morning
how swift thy sword !
true
sky was a superior warrior
he willingly gave his life to this man
he can kill the king
we must proceed
that means we will die
then we die together
you were one step ahead of me
did i hurt you too much?
i should be the one who fights him
i want you to live
if you died , how could i live?
you will live on , promise me
say it !
all right
moon is on her way
i had better go
i am nameless , prefect of leng meng county
please allow me to fight this assassin
she is on his majesty's most wanted list
now she's here , i will arrest her
the assassin and i have an agreement to fight one on one
should i be unable to defeat her please apprehend her
your permission is sought
draw your sword !
hail !
hail !
hail !
make your move !
hail !
hail !
hail !
i die willingly
make your move
hail !
hail !
hail !
hail !
hail !
hail !
hail !
hail !
hail !
hail !
hail !
hail !
how swift thy sword !
what are you here for?
for what you once said .
i will fight the one who harms flying snow
please draw your sword
thank you
i believe you and broken sword also fought but rather it was
a fight to honor flying snow .
my master wishes you to have his sword
why?
he and she are bound in life and death
they will never part , nor will their swords
it is his dying wish that you take his sword for your mission
sky , flying snow and broken sword sacrificed themselves so you can be within 10 paces of me
all three gave you their lives
the best of friends could not give more
therefore you are the most dangerous assassin of all
how did you uncover my plan?
the flames of these candles are disturbed by your murderous intent
all of you are willing to die for a cause
i'm ashamed to say i am not that committed
your majesty has seen through our plan
if i had realised this sooner
i wouldn't have allowed you so close
a citizen of qin would not do this
who are you?
a man of zhao
your qin soldiers killed my family
i wandered into qin and was adopted
i discovered my real identity 10 years ago and set my heart on this plan
you've come to avenge zhao
i see
i would like to know if your special skill has a name
as your majesty guessed there is only one crucial move
what is that?
death within 10 paces .
death within 10 paces . " a good name !
all my guards are 100 paces away outside the palace
you are within 10 paces
it would seem that today i am doomed
but i sense your hesitation
your majesty is perceptive
however you too have underestimated someone .
who?
broken sword
i needed to prove to them that my sword was fast and accurate
within 10 paces my sword strikes with surgical precision
if it enters at precise pressure points it will not cause any fatal injury
if one of you would take a blow before witnesses , we can fool the king
such a blow is hardly child's play
how is sky now?
fully recovered
his trust in your sword was extraordinary
the king's security is impenetrable
there was no other way
his imperial guards were useless
he should have died three years ago .
what went wrong?
i abandoned the plan
the king must not be killed
he said that?
yes
why?
i also asked him
what did he say?
he would not explain that day
broken sword is the strongest of the three
he and i are probably equal in skills
what he told me later greatly unsettled me
while i'm alive
i'll stop you assassinating the king
i will help you
he let the opportunity go by
this time , we must succeed
see you tomorrow at the qin camp
please do me a favor
help me fight broken sword !
master !
what are you waiting for?
although i had agreed to help her attack from behind is dishonorable so i couldn't draw my sword
but we both knew if we did not stop broken sword we would never succeed
moon , don't !
you're no match for him .
stop
i knew this would happen
you can't stop me now
even wounded , i will still stop you
then i will kill you !
did i hurt him too much?
your special medicine should heal his wounds in a day
have you delivered it?
i tended to the wound myself
after the battle , take my sword and follow nameless to see the king
yes
they won't treat a servant harshly
if the assassination succeeds wave a red flag on your return
if it fails , a yellow one
if something happens to you any message will be useless
i will smile from heaven if i see a red flag
how is flying snow?
she is resting
she doesn't know i've come
you said you'd stop me
please abandon the mission
you know i am a man of zhao
so am i
doesn't qin want to conquer zhao?
yes
isn't the king the enemy of zhao?
yes
who are you trying to defend?
you call yourself a man of zhao?
flying snow has asked me that too
when we first met
i was living a carefree life
i fell in love with her after our first fight
she's the daughter of a zhao general who died in battle against qin
she inherited his sword
i knew she would avenge her father
i promised to help her
calligraphy and swordplay share the same principles
we did calligraphy to inspire our swordplay and to heighten our powers
she knew i'd drifted since childhood calling no place home
once we'd killed the king , she said she would take me to her home
there'd be no more swordsmen only a man and a woman
the essence of calligraphy is from the soul
swordsmanship is the same
both aspire to truth and simplicity
gradually i recognised a greater cause
three years ago we perfected our skills
flying snow insisted on going ahead
together , we stormed the palace
she asked why i had abandoned the mission
i told her the king must not be killed
that is what calligraphy taught me
i didn't kill the king
after that she refused to talk to me
please abandon your plan
no
was your sword forged in hatred?
yes
for 10 years , it has never tired
i can't stop now
how can i dissuade you?
only by killing me
are you that determined?
yes
allow me to convey my conviction in three words
these words express my mind
please consider
moon , give my sword to master nameless
flying snow and i will never part nor will our swords
master nameless although i am just a humble servant allow me to say a few words
i've been with my master since i was eight
he taught me martial arts and how to be a decent person
whatever my master does is for a good reason
the words he has given you carry a deep meaning
this will be the iast thing i can do for my master
master nameless , please take his advice
why did you want to do that?
i wanted to follow the example of my master and to persuade you with my life
you're still young life is precious
if you must die you should die for a greater cause
be on your way
i will remember what should be remembered
what were the words he wrote?
all under heaven .
all under heaven ...
broken sword said
the people have suffered years of warfare
only the king of qin can stop the chaos
by uniting all under heaven .
he asked me to abandon the assassination for the greater good of all
he said , one person's suffering is nothing compared to the suffering of many
the rivalry of zhao and qin is trivial compared to the greater cause
the person who really understands me is my most feared enemy
alone , i have endured so much criticism
so many attempts on my life
no one understands my intentions
even my court officials see me as a tyrant
but i never imagined that broken sword , my arch enemy would truly understand and appreciate my real motives
i would like to know how you mean to kill me without your sword?
by capturing yours !
this sword has protected me through all my battles
having found a true confidant in broken sword if i die , i am content with my life
let " all under heaven " guide your decision
it's just dawned on me !
this scroll of broken sword's isn't about sword technique but about swordsmanship's ultimate ideal
swordsmanship's first achievement is the unity of man and sword
once this unity is attained even a blade of grass can be a weapon
the second achievement is when the sword exists in one's heart when absent from one's hand one can strike an enemy at 100 paces even with bare hands
swordsmanship's ultimate achievement is the absence of the sword in both hand and heart
the swordsman is at peace with the rest of the world
he vows not to kill and to bring peace to mankind
your majesty , your visions have convinced me
that you are committed to the highest ideal of ultimate swordsmanship
therefore i cannot kill you
remember those who gave their lives for the highest ideal : peace .
no more killing nameless went within 10 paces of the king
he could not have missed
there is only one explanation
he must have abandoned the mission
what did you say to him?
i wrote three words
what words?
all under heaven .
that is all you care about !
and you
i don't believe you
how can i convince you?
draw your sword
you've misled nameless
you've ruined sky and the kingdom of zhao
draw !
when we first met ...
i had to prove myself to convince you
what can i do this time?
just draw your sword !
why didn't you fend off my sword?
so that you'd believe me
i always wanted to go home with you
sadly , it won't happen now
take good care of yourself
why didn't you defend yourself?
why didn't you defend yourself?
why didn't you?
no more drifting , no more roaming
i'm taking you home now
our home
your majesty , permission to execute?
permission to execute?
your majesty , permission to execute?
permission to execute?
he conspired to assassinate your majesty
show no mercy !
this is the law of qin !
to conquer all under heaven the law must be enforced
set an example for the world !
execute him !
execute him !
execute him !
execute him !
execute him !
execute him !
execute him !
hail !
hail !
hail !
hail !
hail !
hail !
