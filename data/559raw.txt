when will be our next race , ryousuke?
when you beat all the downhill racers in gumma , then i`il race you
off road?
downhill
all the downhill roads in japan
starting tomorrow , you start from the south , i the north
we`il compete with different downhill racers
let`s see who ends up winning more , ok?
you not gonna race in the tracks?
the tracks?
downhill roads are much more fun
i`m back
what`s wrong?
honey ...
help me change my underpants
son of a bitch , why did you change my underwear?
where`re you going?
off to school
school?
isn`t it your summer vacation?
you`re always out .
are you a rent boy now?
lingerie?
you know what`s a god?
a god was once human
but he could do what other humans could not
that`s why he became a god
a year ago , that bitch of a principal expelled me
she said , itsuki , why don`t you ... call yourself `eat shit` instead?
then it hit me
i have to tell the world
itsuki`s not a piece of shit
i`il be a racer
within a year , i`ve become the racing god of mt akina
the boss of the speedstars race team
but you didn`t get your license until last year
that`s what we called talents
it`s simple , just like drifting .
how?
pull the handbrake at a turn to swing the car sideways
how`s that?
cool
won`t it ... slow the car down?
how`d you drift then?
floor the gas pedal
don`t slow for the curve
then ...
then you and your car fly off the cliff
i don`t blame you .
we got our licenses together
yet you still haven`t touched the wheel
why don`t you join my team?
i don`t have a car
don`t worry , you can wash mine
i drive , you wash .
what a promising career
come on , bro .
cheers
milk .
what`s so good about it?
lots of calcium and protein
also good for your eyes
a good racer needs good eyes
wanna go to a movie later?
can`t .
i got my part time job
had an eyeful?
natsuki from class 2b
in white today
having fun?
why so nervous?
you guys are close , huh?
not at all
no?
i heard that you had a fight over her ... with bulldog from the neighboring class
time for work
right , time for my allowance too
were those your classmates?
yes
they look like punks .
street racers?
no , they work at the gas station after school
they work hard but earn only 100k yen a month
i bet you`ve spent all the cash i gave you last time
thanks for taking care of me and my mom
but that`s too much
take it .
you deserve it
what kind of dad are you?
i only ask you for a million yen and you say no?
i`m worried you`il be in solitude during your last years
i`m sure my last years will be just fine
how so?
what if i leave you after i become a world champ?
i still have my gas station
cashier , boss
after you die , it will be mine anyway .
get it?
okay , consider that an advance from my pay
an advance?
excluding the money i spent raising you , you have already borrowed 8, 635, 000 yen
an advance?
what have you done , mr. world champ?
i have no idea
welcome , sir .
which gas would you prefer?
does the racing god of mt akina own this station?
sorry , but i don`t know
look , this is what a car should be
great bodykit , alloy rims .
wow , sports wheel
what`s the price tag on this?
are you the racing god of mt akina?
it`s actually me
but i was told he`s the owner here
yes , i`il be the owner in a few years when he dies
you hit your own son .
beware of divine intervention
we`re the night kids team from myog
my name is nakazato
i`d like to race the racing god of mt akina
there`s no racing god in mt akina
if you`re looking for god , there`s a temple over there
anyway , i`il be waiting for you at mt akina tonight
wash the car .
we`il go up to mt akina tonight
how many races have you won?
how `bout you?
same here
who you racin` tonight?
how `bout we go for a race first?
so crowded .
you sure you can manage?
take it easy .
i`il give my best
i have to be home ... at 3
you know my dad
don`t worry
what?
still nervous?
look , so many people ...
hurry up .
i need to give my assistant a ride home
you gonna take him with you in the race?
is that forbidden?
looks like this guy knows nothing at all
well , in that case , i better sit with you
you guys are gay or what?
i better leave
fatty , we`il start from here .
the first one who ... gets to the parking lot wins
bullshit .
of course the faster wins
five
four
three
two
he`s a real amateur
we`il see at the first corner
the car behind is kissing ours
this guy is clueless
what you gonna do?
just stay calm
let`s overtake him .
it`s safer
that`s not necessary
watch out ahead .
what?
ahead
look what you`ve done .
told you to stay calm
it`s all because of you wouldn`t stay calm
see , i told you i would take you home on time
bastard
what do you mean?
you`re the bastard who puke right after you got out
looks like it`s `bout time we have a race here
it`s not the right time yet
why?
you wanna hear the truth?
go ahead
i noticed something while i was in your car .
you`re not smooth each time you attacked a corner
although your gtr has big horsepower , but the engine is heavy
there`re so many corners in mt akina
your car was understeered at every turn
especially the 5 consecutive hairpins
you couldn`t cut to the best lane every time
unless you can overcome this , you stand no chance with my fc
unless you can overcome this , you stand no chance with my fc
so glad you`re safe
you have to be safe in order to be a world champ
i wanna buy a gtr
i`il get you a mercedes instead
i wanna buy a gtr
and a rolex
i wanna buy a gtr
but you almost killed yourself last night
it wouldn`t happen if i were driving a gtr
if you were driving a gtr , you would have died
i wanna buy a gtr
welcome
how could i help you?
you can`t help me , i`m here for the fatty racing god
racing god?
what you up to?
trying to put me down?
i lost to an ae86 last night
he dashed around the corner with inertia drift
i could only catch the tofu shop label on it
you know him?
if you do , just tell him that
i`il be waiting for him on mt akina saturday night
takumi?
it got nothing to do with me
i was here last night
whoever beat him last night is the real racing god
don`t tell me that was you
it`s ... my old pal bunta
what?
say it again
i know it sounds incredible
like i`m standing here looking at you
but the guy with the gtr did say you beat him
gtr?
is it very powerful?
350 horsepower , a four wheeler ...
fortified body ... it`s japan`s national treasure
so what?
just go race with him for fun
it`s really hot
i`d kick your ass if you were my dad
i`m leaving , take care
take care , bye
takumi ...
takum
takum
takum
didn`t you say hot spring rice bun is your favorite?
i`m very sorry you were punished by the principal ... for beating up the boy because of me
i`ve been trying to thank you ever since
but each time i saw you , you seemed to ignore me
it`s because ... i`m afraid ...
i`m afraid the school ...
others in school would think ...
because ...
you`re afraid they would think you and i are ...
we`ve been in the same class since grade school
we`ve always talked about anything
but these days it seems that you`re avoiding me
i haven`t talked to you for weeks already
how`s the bun?
so i can still talk to you in the future?
i have something important to tell you
i bought a very sexy swimsuit
before the finals , you promised , to take me for a spin to the beach
have you forgotten?
i bought the swimsuit right after you told me that
at last i chose the one with the least cloth
why`re you looking like that?
you`re choked?
are you ok?
i`m okay ...
how`re you?
are you ok?
don`t scare me
i`m okay
takumi , you`il pick me up at the station this sunday
you promised
i gotta go now
bye bye .
bye bye
you`il pick me up at the station this sunday .
you promised
dad
have you beaten a gtr in mt akina recently?
i think so
was the car real fast?
it`s seriously fast on straight roads
but when it entered corners , it became real slow
you really found it slow?
what`s it you wanna know?
nothing really .
just curious
i bought a very sexy swimsuit
do you need your car this sunday?
yeah
the market union is having a potluck .
wanna go?
you wanna go?
what a rude brat
hey , tofuman
what`s up , gasman?
i`m looking for you
what for?
got a fun and crowded place to go
cheers
you`re asking me out tonight
so you`re not mad i don`t go to your gas station?
no ... i was mad you asked everyone not to come
your gas was indeed more expensive
but my gas was of higher quality
so you asked me out to talk `bout this?
no
i didn`t expect you could still hold up at your age
you asked these girls to test me out?
i`il show you
i`m referring to you winning the gtr the other night
that wasn`t me
i haven`t been delivering in mt akina for years
so ... i saw a ghost that night?
that was my boy takum
takumi?
one night 5 years ago , my hemorrhoids were hurting bad
it`s excruciating .
they were this big .
damn
so i asked my boy to deliver for me
but ... he was barely 13 then
what`s the big deal?
it`s mt akina
there`s not a soul at 4 in the morning
i would just let him
he left home at 4 , and returned at 5 : 30
a year later , he`d come back at 5 : 15 , or even at 5
two years later , he`s been back before 4 : 30
within a half hour?
including delivery?
it only takes him four and a half minutes ... to go around mt akina
you telling me he never had an accident?
not at all
once he rushed home to sleep and floored the pedal
all the tofu was crushed
put this in the car
don`t spill a single drop , or i`il kill you
go
it took him two hours to get back at first
then ... one and a half hour
a month later , it`s an hour
gradually it became half an hour
but i haven`t been timing him lately
your boy is so good , why don`t you ask him to race the gtr driver again?
i`il pay for the gas
i was treated as a shitty racer when i was young
who knows my boy would be even worse
you know he`s the only son in the whole family
if anything should happen to him ...
get another one then
hey , tofuman
tofuman
but what `bout the gtr?
and tonight`s bill?
tofuman .
you bastard
bring me the scissors
i bought a very sexy swimsuit
boss , this sunday ... i`d like ...
let me through
what do you want?
dad , i`ve decided not to buy the gtr now
that`s my boy
takumi`s dad is right : a racer should stand up again ... after each defeat
dad
let me race in your car tonight
my car?
from this moment on , i`m no longer your dad
so how `bout mom?
what `bout mom?
if she knew you went to the nightclub last night , what do you think she would do?
who`re you looking for?
tofuman , you bastard
you sent my son to die , itsuki drove off with my car
you have to ask takum to go to mt akina tonight
i`m not free right now
what you mean by that?
this is the first time i begged you , and you said no?
what `bout the nightclub bill last night?
what kinda tofu you want?
19 years ago , the fastest racer in gumma province ... was bunta fujiwwara of mt akina
a gifted racer of that era
many racers told me that ... you could be the first world champ in japan
but you chose to get married 19 years ago
you became a tofu man instead of a racer
sometimes one decision can change one`s whole life
it goes with racing and it goes with life
but not everyone can figure out the consequence
like you didn`t guess your wife would leave you
anger .
that`s what a racer needs
i wanna race you , just once
sorry , what you want is not for sale here
please go to another shop
sorry to disturb you
don`t answer it .
it`s some asshole calling
hey
you wanna use the car tomorrow?
go up to mt akina tonight .
if you can win the gtr ,
i`il let you use my car tomorrow
with a tank of gas
brim full
tofuman
if takumiw wins the gtr at mt akina tonight , your nightclub bill would ... would ... you know?
we`ve blocked all the cars going uphill already
all the roads are clear .
the race can start any time
hey , racing god , give me a break , ok?
you couldn`t even enter a curve .
with this car ...
i`m afraid you`il die
whatcha doing?
this is a public area
you can`t block the road with guys holding walkie talkies
i`il call the cops
you really won`t leave?
after you
whatcha doing?
don`t mess with my car
don`t touch my car
ryousuke , an ae86 is coming uphill
the real racing god has arrived
takumi`s dad
itsuki
takumi , it`s you?
where`s your dad?
uncle
is he hiding?
no , he asked me to come ...
for what?
delivering tofu?
no , to race the gtr
stop pulling my leg
you don`t even know how to enter a curve .
you`il die
that`s ok .
i`ve been delivering tofu here for 5 years
i know , but you gotcha license last year
i already beat him once
so it was you last time?
tofuman ...
tofuman
if takumiw wins , is the nightclub bill settled?
didn`t we discuss this two hours ago?
two hours ago?
the gtr is very fast .
you think takumiw has a chance?
all your cars were dearer and faster than mine
but did you ever win , you idiot?
that`s different , `coz you`re crazy
did i ever say that my son is normal?
five, four, three ...
go for it two , one ...
go
don`t wag your tail too much
but the ae86 is not picking up speed
it`s ok to lose a little at the beginning
there`re less straights and more sharp corners later
that will be the show time for my boy
the mighty gtr is leading all the way
the ae86 is no match for it on straight roads
he may catch up at the corners
i`m afraid it has no chance to get near the gtr
they`re entering the curves .
the ae86 is gaining
yet the gtr is extremely accurate in turning
the ae86 has changed its tactic and begins to drift
they`re getting closer at the center of the curve
the ae86 attacks the corner very fast
the cars almost touched each other as they drifted out
your boy is really that good?
a few years ago , my boy told me he needed glasses
so i took him to an optician
but his eyesight turned out to be 20 0
hey , kid ...
i`il kick your ass if you`re kidding me .
and he said , when he drove , he found everything else getting slower and slower
i knew then ... that he was getting faster and faster
i lost at this corner last time .
it won`t happen again
the ae86 is sticking close to the gtr .
unbelievable
the ae86 tries to overtake , but the gtr blocks the lane
that`s unfair .
it`s foul play
you like a good licking?
the ae86 fails to pass , but they`re closer at the corner
the ae86 is looking for a chance at the back
if what you said is true , then it`s sure win for takumi?
it all depends on ... the last 5 ... consecutive .... hairpins
the last 5 hairpins .
the ae86 is not slowing down
he can`t pass at this speed
the ae86 has overtaken at the inner curve
can the gtr catch up ... at the remaining hairpins?
the gtr is slowing down , the ae86 has won
it`s very funny the way you drove
weren`t you up the hill?
you`re down already?
i heard you used the ditch to enter the corner , right?
i`d like to race you too .
you`ve got time?
i`m sorry .
i raced tonight `coz my dad asked me to
i don`t think there`il be a next time
maybe you`il change your mind tomorrow
it`s done
i`ve raised you right .
you make me proud
hey , come on
what is it?
nothing
what`s with the towel?
it`s the sunlight
don`t be shy
or you see me in swimsuit and ...
i`m not
takumi , why all these wounds?
these wounds are ...
inflicted by my dad
after mom left us , dad got drunk all the time
he beat me up when he got drunk .
disgusting , huh?
i think you look more hunky that way
a real man gotta have a few scars on his body
i hate those sissies with smooth skin
especially this one on your back
that`s three years ago
this one is last week`s
does it hurt?
and here?
that`s a mosquito bite
you fooled me
here we are
your driving is really good , takumiw
i always felt carsick on long rides
but i didn`t even need to take pills today
that`s good
i really had a fantastic time today .
thanks so much
you`re welcome
bye bye
bye bye
you know what`s a god?
a god is actually human
but he can do what other humans can`t
god , please save me
please save my car as well
sit down
is the world champ getting cuckoo?
he bought an ae86 , that`s why
what about him?
that`s easy , he`s in love
what`s with you today?
you won`t get it
of course i will
a man`s problem could only be cash or chicks
what do you want?
you said you`d teach me to drive
when did i say that?
who cares .
i`il drive downhill at the highest speed
give me a few tips
given my talents , things will sink in after this once
let`s go then , it`il be quick
have you fastened your seat belt?
look out for the back
wow , what a speed , can`t wait to get laid or what?
turn on the hazard lights .
let the car pass
why`s it kissing my ass?
whatcha want?
sorry , i thought it`s the tofu shop`s ae86
but it`s just ... a piece of junk
kids
don`t wander around at this hour
better go home and sleep
he meant you
he must be gay , wearing a bandanna at night
i think he`s up on the hill for ...
junk ... simply junk
let me drive
whatcha want?
say something
he was trying to kill us .
didn`t you see?
so what?
he said you`re a piece of junk
let him say whatever he likes .
we don`t care
hey , the brake ...
the brake , yo
the brake
itsuki , what`s wrong with your car?
what `bout it?
it doesn`t brake when it enters a corner
all four wheels are flying off the ground
and it almost overturns every time it exits a corner
so why you still driving so fast?
i gotta chase that asshole
i wanna go home ....
dad
daddy
itsuki , are you ok?
are you sure?
ok?
takumi , what kinda driver are you?
sorry for wrecking itsuki`s car .
i`il pay for it
i`m not talking about this .
do you know ... the guy last night is a member of the emperor team?
he`s a professional racer
you`ve beaten his evo in this piece of junk
are you crazy or what?
but it`s exactly the same as my dad`s
how could it be the same?
your dad has spent so much time and effort on the car
it took him a month to find the right suspension
this one over here ...
only an idiot like my boy could be conned to buy this crap
where`s itsuki?
the world champ`s useless .
just a spin and he`s been puking till now
who would get carsick?
takumi , you`re different
you`il probably become an ace racer one day
keep it up
hey
what`s wrong?
you dropped your money?
the suspension .
it took you one month to fiwx it?
why so long?
not just the suspension
i needed to test the tires , the brake , vertical distance , balance between front and rear ...
it took about a month
is it really fun being a racer?
why?
you wanna be a racer?
i dunno
you dunno?
then come on in and help me make tofu
your friend`s been helping me for the whole afternoon
my friend?
you`re too kind
it`s no trouble
please have some tea , uncle
the tofu is done .
i also made some dimsum
thanks
you`re welcome
takumi , you`re back
how come you`re here?
look who`s talking
you haven`t called me once since the swim last time
so i came to pay you a visit
natsuki , where`s the dimsum?
just a second
it`s so nice having a woman in the house
oh ... and in such a short skirt
if only it`s two inches shorter ...
you should`ve called me first
i called you several times
either you`re at work or you`re sleeping
lucky that uncle is a nice guy
he ain`t no nice guy
but i`ve been chatting with him on the phone for days
he`s actually very fond of you , you know?
you`ve been chatting with him for days?
what`s so strange about it?
what did he say?
uncle told me you wanna be a racer
i never said that
he also told me , if you try hard enough , you`il become a world class racer some day
someone once told me , it`s most important to find a world that belongs to us
life is meaningful only when we can find this world
takumi , i think for you , this world is racing
who told you that?
it`s an uncle who told me that
uncle?
since my father died , he`s been taking care of me and my mom
i thought it`s my dad
i knew he couldn`t be that deep
so who is this uncle , natsuki?
it`s most important to find a world that belongs to us
life is meaningful only when we can find this world
if you try hard enough , you`il become a world class racer some day
takumi , i think for you , this world is racing
you deliver tofu so early in the morning?
something wrong with the car?
wrong?
i`m tuning it
remember i told you i wanna race with you?
i never agreed
if i ask you again now , would you agree?
co ordinating the suspension and the tires ... really takes a whole month?
you wanna know?
yeah
it`s crucial to increase the barometer of the turbocharger
but keep an eye on the input air volume
and the exhaust valve should be accommodated
suspension must be tuned based on hardness and absorption , the tire siwze and its angle formed on the road , plus the lower arm bar and tower bar
then fine tune it based on the computer data
your dad is incrediwble
if i were to retune it , it would take me at least 6 months
the balance has been tuned to its optimal level
simply put ...
it`s perfect
so my old man is really that good
however , every car has its limit
you`re bound to find it unsatisfactory one day
just get another one
but i only like ae86
so how `bout our race?
3 weeks from now .
on saturday
that long?
you said it took 3 weeks to retune your car , right?
that`s him
got it
be careful , he`s very fast in the corners
it`s just an ae86 after all
are you ok?
listen , this junk is for tofu delivery , not for racing with us
it`s for your own good , got it?
that`s right .
you are professional racers
of course you look down on us street racers
professional and street , we`re all racers
right , you beat me once
you remember?
wanna win again?
ok , call me , you have my team`s number
is the ae87 out already?
isn`t it the ae89 now?
just talk , don`t fight
hitting your kid in public will inflict mental damage
shut up
tofuman
let`s talk , don`t fight
hitting your kid in public will inflict mental damage
i`m going home
still upset about losing?
i asked kyouichiw who beat you to race again in 3 weeks
you`re invited
if you don`t have another car , i do
thanks , but i only wanna drive my own car
give me a call if you change your mind
want some cheesecake?
it`s delicious
natsukiw bought it for you
when did she come?
she`s going home for 2 weeks but will call you later
what else did she say?
what else she`s supposed to say?
hey .
hey ...
you eating the whole cake?
you`il be stuffed to death
tofuman , your ae86 is already an antiwque
might as well change to a new car
don`t tell me you gonna put it into the ae86?
isn`t this great?
this is for race car only .
you wanna go to jail?
you`re nuts
catching roaches , itsuki?
no , looking for my old man
he hasn`t been back for days , just like you
customer
that sucks .
he`s not young anymore
he`s so irresponsiwble , leaving his business like this
what`s gonna happen to me if it goes bankrupt?
it`s good that i`ve been living on my own , or else i wouldn`t be this chubby
boss .
what are you doing?
uncle , what`re you up to?
we went for a spin at mt akina
has he come down yet?
coming
sounded like a high rpm
but it wasn`t fast enough as it entered the corner
hop in
i`il only show you once
watch carefully .
pay attention to the new tachometer
its power won`t become obvious till 1 1, 000 revs
sit tight .
i wanna drive faster
miya
the kaiseki dinner was delicious , huh?
not bad
i`m glad
thanks so much for taking care of me ... when i puked two whole days last time
you were like a goddess who saved me
you`re crazy
i mean it
i believe in gods
a god was actually human , but he could do what other humans could not
so he became a god
but you know ...
a god also does what most humans do occasionally
whatcha wanna say?
most humans would ... sometimes go to this neighboring love hotel and ...
it`s ok since you`re in the filling up business ...
bastard
natsuki?
what the heck?
i test drove the car with my dad yesterday , you know?
this new car had a new tachometer .
i didn`t know till yesterday
just imagine , ae86 , 250 horsepower
you know how fast is 250 hp?
i tried to make a turn at 150 mph
it took me 3 minutes through the entire mt akina
amazing , huh?
i really wanna tell everyone .
you ... and natsukiw
no need
no need for what?
no need to tell natsuki
takumiw
there`s something i wanna tell my best mate
who?
you
go ahead
i saw natsuki ...
she entered a love hotel with a guy
love hotel?
love hotel
there must be a mistake
it only costs 30, 000 yen to bang her
what did you say?
30, 000 yen to bang her
your girl is a whore
come again?
i don`t want you get conned , and you hit me?
go to hell
bastard !
go to hell !
what you guys doing?
come over !
i`ve known you since 7

go ahead , hit me !
takumi , stop it !

stop it , boy !
stop it !
takumi ...
why you hit him , you jerk?
me a jerk?
yeah , i jerk off too
hello?
it`s me
i shouldn`t have called your girl a whore .
i`m sorry
you forgot?
today is saturday
everyone is waiting for you and your ae86
hello
hello?
it`s me
what`s up?
i couldn`t reach you for days
i`ve been in my hometown
i`m boarding the train now . `il be back tonight
i`m racing in mt akina tonight
right after i`m done , i`il go see you
no , why don`t i go see you tomorrow instead?
the train is here .
talk to you later
natsuki , i wanna see you badly
natsuki
i`m glad you stayed with me this past holiday
did i give you enough money last time?
we`d better not see each other anymore after tonight
i don`t wanna be like this anymore
i don`t wanna see you again and remember this
all i want is to be with takumiw
isn`t it too much , broom head?
i know ryousuke well
i will never lose to the same guy ... twice
shit , i hope i didn`t hurt him bad
dream on , look who`s talking
your nose` been bleeding for days
see , here you go again
damn .
i hope it won`t become a monthly routine
what`re we still waiting for?
everyone`s here already
are you in a hurry?
give him 5 more minutes
who cares if he comes .
the race is between you and me
block the road .
the race will begin in 5 minutes
wait , a car is coming up
it`s the ae86
there weren`t so many girls at the races in our days
that`s right
uncles , this is a ladies only zone .
get lost
it`s coming up ...
so you`ve resurrected this piece of junk?
way to go , tofu boy
what happened to the car you crashed into the hill?
tofu boy , you wanna go first?
no need .
just drive faster , i got other things to do
for you
no need
ryousuke has something to tell you
listen .
although kyouichiw is a professional , all professionals have their weaknesses ...
you don`t need to teach me .
i`m gonna win anyway
what about me?
i`il beat you too
the road is clear .
we can start anytime
we can start anytime
five
four
three
two
one
go
all three cars took off at top speed
kyouichi`s e3 is leading , followed by ryousuke`s fc
the ae86 comes last
they`ve past the first corner
both ryousuke and takumiw made their best lap time
everyone`s faster in the presence of a professional
whatcha doing?
that`s what we called strategy
the fc suddenly lags behind before the tunnel
i wonder what`s happened to ryousuke?
the speed is unbelievable
all three cars exceed 100 kph at the corner just now
the ae86 is waiting for its opportunity
let`s see if it can overtake the e3 in the next corner
go for it , takumiw
give it back .
what`s with you?
what?
it`s a race
of course we have to shout .
go ahead
here we go
overtaken
the e3 doesn`t leave much room
both the fc and ae86 used the ditch to overtake the e3
let me explain , little girl
in street racing , a professional`s common weakness ... is to leave some open space when taking a right corner
go for it , takumiw
takumi , it`s just you and me now
what `bout the car at the back?
i can block for you
better watch your own ass
the ae86 and fc both managed to pass a professional
but the e3 is trying to catch up
although they use different tactics , the fc and ae86 are way too fast in entering corners
it`s not an easy task catching up
go for it , takumi ...
attention , everyone
a vehicle has just taken off from the national park , and is heading up the mountain
a car is coming ahead .
get ready to slow down
kyouichiw ignores the warning and tries to overtake
should we block him?
it`s too late
the e3 has crashed
the ae86 and fc passed through .
the race goes on
is he ok?
forget him
kyouichi , are you ok?
the 5 consecutive hairpins .
can the fc pass it here?
the ae86 is at its limit .
now it`s my turn
the fc has overtaken the ae86
there`s only 1 km left
i don`t think the ae86 can make it
what the heck?
i knew it
you knew again?
takumiw has never taken the leading position before
ryousuke`s car is powerful but he still followed takumiw
he wants to learn his move and then overtake him
so it`s a lost case for takumi?
not necessarily
you`ve been driving by yourself all these years
you`ve never competed with anyone
remember
don`t pay attention to the competition itself
ignore other racers
the one you need to beat is yourself
almost at the finish line .
the ae86 hasn`t given up
it`s still right behind the fc
the fc has missed its lane when entering the corner
can ryousuke withstand the pressure from the ae86?
the pressure is from the tires
it`s retuned to 250 hp , but the fc is still too powerful
as time drags on , the tires won`t hold up , and the car can`t go all the way in its drift
so the last 2 corners are the most crucial in this race
it`s here
the finish line is up ahead
the mighty fc has the absolute edge .
the result is quite clear
the fc seems to be slower entering the corner
the ae86 is taking the inner lane , can it overtake?
the ae86 has won
the ae86 is the ultimate racing god of mt akina
great .
he did it
he won
let`s hug !
i`ve lost anyway
so what`s your plan now?
nothing .
you?
i`m gonna set up a new race team .
wanna join?
dunno .
gotta go
takumi , i really want you on my team
sleep on it
we`il see
takumiw
takumi .
takumi ...
it`s most important to find a world that belongs to us
life is meaningful only when we can find this world
takumi , i think for you , this world is racing
so what`s up?
you lost or what?
hey .
hey ...
let`s drink to it
son of a bitch
itsuki , i`m sorry
ryousuke , takumi here
i`d like ... to join your race team
