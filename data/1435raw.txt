tsk , tsk , tsk .

who knows?
i don't know . i don't know who they could be .
albert must have mixed in with something terrible .
she's hungry and cold , poor thing .
i've got to take her to 'em . i've got to take her to ann's parents .
all right , you go .
leave baby alice with them . i'll get to work , and i'll meet you later at the ten bells .
mostlyjews live here .
notice something , inspector?
i paid . i already paid . i'm not after you , emperor .
where is he?
move it !
hey !
get up .
get up !
hello , darling .
sergeant .
it's night .
well spotted , inspector abberline . indeed , it is night .
the genius has returned to us .
thank you , gentlemen , and remember ... if you ever wish to escape the dreary confines of your present duties ... this never happened .
cut along , now .
have i lost a day?
no , inspector . indeed , it's only four hours since you left here .
oh , deepest apologies for the , uh , rude awakening . i suspect you enjoyed that . i must be cruel only to be kind , as the poet said .
although i would happily wallop you every time you chased the dragon .
well , i had a sneaking suspicion you might interrupt .
you've seen something .
what did you see?
are her petticoats saturated with blood?
you know , they used to burn men like you alive .
sometime this evening a bang tail was murdered in george yard .
that doesn't sound much out of the ordinary . it was the way she was done , inspector . it was the way the bang tail was done ... that cries out for a man of your talents .
her name was martha tabram . i don't know what sort of name tabram is .
it sounds foreign to me .
this is not what i saw .
not the woman of your dreams?
you sure?
yeah .
show him .
you show him .
why do i have to be exposed to this degradation over and over again?
i've looked at the mess twice !
before he cut her throat , he removed her livelihood ... as a keepsake .
gentlemen , we are indeed fortunate today ... to be able to observe an entirely new approach ... to the treatment of insanity . it is oh , dr. ferral . i was just saying , we're here in the hope that you will permit us ... to observe this new treatment of yours .
well , i wasn't expecting such distinguished visitors , sir william .
but you're all welcome , of course . i'm ready to begin right now .
who is your patient?
ann crook .
an unfortunate , sir william ... who's hysterical and violent ... and has severe delusions of persecution .
oh , poor girl .
uh , do please proceed , dr. ferral .
gentlemen .
we have one tap above ...
and one into the left lobe ...
and ... one on the right ... and this unlucky patient's dementia ... will no longer take a violent form .
thanks to this simple procedure ... we can now permanently alleviate the poor girl's suffering .
what could i do? i had to leave the baby with ann's parents .
rich man .
thought he was gonna take care of ann .
knew that was too bloody good to be true .
they're gonna kill every one of us .
who is this albert , anyway?
who is he?
oh , for god's sake , who cares about albert and ann's troubles?
what are we gonna do?
we can't stay clear of the nichols boys forever .
you know , they say they held poor martha down ... and watched her bleed until she passed out , and then cut her throat .
oh !
shocking .
mcqueen is mad .
he enjoys hurting women .
that's insane .
they want four pounds .
how we gonna get four pounds?
not with my old cunny . i'd be lucky to get four pence .
oi , oi , oi !
behave yourselves or bugger off ! .
yeah , you can bugger off .
we work , girls .
we work the streets harder than ever .
right?
right?
all right , we can do it here .
but hurry up .
the bobbies are fussing us tonight .
all right .
gotta get the old man off first , right?
give it here . i'll put it in meself .
oh , that's ni
ooh !
eh?
yeah , yeah . is it in?
of course it is .
come on .
no , it's not .
you got it stuck between your bleedin 'legs .
no , i haven't .
come on , get a move on . i knows it when i feels it .
oh !
that's mine , polly .
that's my money .
i could pop your eye out .
customers wouldn't mind .
they don't mind if a whore can't see .
what's that?
what have i got here?
what have i got here , constable?
only a little thing .
only a little thing to you , but a great thing to me .
move , or i'll bash that smart mouth .
you're a dead woman .
he won't bother you again tonight .
yeah , that's right .
look , one for the nichols .
yeah?
and one for me .
right?
oh .
come here .
come here .
hey .
shh .
hey , we work the streets together . i'll keep my eye on you , love , eh?
oh , you pig !
you disgusting pig !
yeah , i'm a pig . i'm what's wrong with the world .
be on your own , then .
oh , no !
you don't want the company of a pig !
what the fuck are you lookin 'at?
i slept with you !
thirsty?
mmm .
that was the thing that was in my dream .
what's it called again?
cleopatra's needle .
mmm .
cleopatra .
she was a beauty , wasn't she? it was carved 1, 500 years before the son of god was born .
mmm .
six men died to bring it here ... from egypt .
may the good lord have mercy .
she was like that when i found her all murdered .
what kind of monster did this?
woman , i told you .
who was the first to see her?
you go in .
keep to the streets .
settle back , now .
the boys have made their rounds of the taverns and the delightful domiciles ... that make up this charming little street .
would it surprise you to learn that nobody heard a sound?
throat was cut , but there's no arterial spray on the wall .
she was killed somewhere else .
it rained last night , didn't it?
mm hmm .
she's dry .
she was brought here in a carriage or something .
throat must have been cut in the carriage . i imagine they stopped it just over there .
they "?
they "?
there's more than one , then .
most definitely .
this was all in your vision?
take your missus home .
where were the coppers last night?
oh, jesus .
so ... definitely more than one person .
has to be a message from the nichols boys .
am i right?
what the hell?
that's grapes , isn't it?
what the hell would a bang tail be doing with grapes?
i'd like to give them an answer .
what are you talking about?
the nichols boys . i would welcome the opportunity ... to give them an answer to their bloody message .
there is most definitely a message here .
you're right about that .
and what am i wrong about?
martha tabram was raped , tortured and killed .
that's cruel .
but i've seen that sort of cruelty in the east end before .
this is methodical .
the butchery's irrational ... yet meticulous and deliberate .
altogether a different breed of killer .
as soon as possible i'd like to know what he took .
what?
what do you mean , what he took?
didn't you notice?
what?
he's taken at least one of her organs .
oh , no .
i want every veterinarian , butcher ... and furrier in the district interviewed .
furrier?
what did he do , sir?
skin her?
pipe down , withers .
when the inspector is talking , you are listening .
do you understand?
yes , sergeant .
he disemboweled her .
after he cut her throat , he stabbed her in the chest ... cut open her stomach ... and , uh , took out her intestines .
at least one of her organs was removed . i'm waiting for the police surgeon's report for more details .
i see .
well , one thing's for certain : an englishman didn't do it .
maybe one of these red indians ... wandered into whitechapel and indulged his natural inclinations .
with all due respect , sir ... i believe this was done by someone ... with at least a working knowledge of dissection .
an educated man , such as a doctor  an educated man?
that's preposterous .
no well bred man would do this .
probably a tradesman or a butcher .
a tradesman is a possibility , sir , yes .
but there's a strong indication against it .
there was a sprig of grapes found under her body .
what are you driving at?
no one in whitechapel , no matter what their trade ... could afford grapes .
obviously they were given to her by the killer .
and it follows that he must be someone with money .
what about thejews?
ajew butcher .
or a jew tailor might have money .
there are plenty of them in whitechapel .
well , sir , for the sake of public safety in general ... i'd like to be careful about spreading the rumors that it might be a jew .
inspector , i know your reputation ... for making brilliant guesses that turn out to be right .
someone told me you claimed to dream the answers .
frankly , it doesn't matter to me what your methods are .
but be certain you don't proceed without proof . is that clear?
of course , sir .
personally , i don't care .
the fewer pinch pricks on the streets , the better .
but the sooner you find this butcher or tailor , inspector ... the sooner we can all celebrate your promotion .
keep me informed .
he didn't know nothin '!
bloodyjew did it ! it's gotta be !
murdering kikes !
every cellar !
every stable !
we'll find him out !
some bleedin'jew !
come on !
that's enough !
let's burn 'em out !
upbeat ]
i have wonderful news .
tell me .
surely you , of all people , can guess . i don't want to guess with you .
dr. marbury says ...
dr. marbury says?
dr. marbury says i'm going to have your child .
aye , to die ... and go we know not where ... but to lie in cold obstruction and to rot .
a simple " rest in peace " would suffice , godley .
yes , sir . in the midst of life we are in death .
of whom may we seek for succor but of thee , o lord ... who , for our sins , are justly displeased?
yet , o lord , god most holy , o lord most mighty
good afternoon , ladies . i'm inspector abberline .
this is sergeant godley .
we're investigating the murders of polly nichols and martha tabram .
yes , we understand that they were both friends of you ladies .
close friends .
we're rather hoping you'd be able to help us out .
don't know nothing .
me neither .
why you botherin 'us?
you ought to be botherin 'mcqueen . is he the boss on nichol street?
he's the heart and soul of the gang . isn't it your job to be knowin 'that small detail?
and what makes you think mcqueen did this to your friends?
can't prove nothing by me .
you're mary kelly . is that right?
that's right .
well , mary kelly , unless one of you is willing to testify against mcqueen ... i can't do nothing .
surely , inspector ... a strong , handsome man like you ... you could do anything you put your brilliant mind to .
i'm a coward and a weakling and i can't help meself .
what's your excuse?
why are you so bloody useless?
come on , mary .
that won't help us .
is that you?
before my mother died , back in ireland . is that when you came here?
yeah .
when i was eight .
when things was good .
we were starvin ', but we were starvin 'in fresh air .
i was thinking ... we ain't ever gonna earn enough to satisfy the nichols boys ... and feed our own mouths .
you said , right you said those men , yeah?
the ones who took her rich artist man and who took her as well .
you said they was clean shaven and their clothes was neat .
yeah , right .
well , they weren't no criminals then . i mean , they weren't the likes of the nichols boys .
they was unusual .
perhaps even official .
what are you gettin 'at , annie?
maybe we could go with the papers .
get paid for the story , you know .
where is ann crook?
that sort of thing .
the papers are always desperate for things bad about the government .
and it's a mystery to boot . it's not a bad plan .
what do you think , mary? i'm thinkin 'we should talk to that inspector , the one at polly's funeral .
oh , fuck me , no ! if we go to the papers they might hurt ann or do something to her baby .
what , worse than what'll happen to her in whitechapel when she sprouts teats? i don't know for sure , but i think we're better off talkin'to that inspector .
lord , you are young after all .
four bitches .
that's what i thought .
you only paid for one bloody person .
they're my guests .
guests?
well , let me welcome your guests .
go on , get out !
go on , get out !
get out of here , you bloody whores !
go on !
when you have four pence ... you can come back with your ladies in waitin ', your grace .
oh , shut up !
ow !
back to work , then .
well , let's try and stay together .
you know we can't .
then stay good and clear of nichol street .
come on !
all right , annie?
ehh .
bloody bastard .
how's your head?
oh , very funny !
hyah !
boo !
i didn't frighten you , did i?
i been lookin'for ya . i been lookin 'all over for ya .
you been looking for me?
not for me .
on behalf of my gentleman .
a very fine gentleman .
he sent me to find ya .
your gentleman sent you to find me?
oh , get off . i might be unfortunate , but i'm not a blitherin 'idiot . it's the truth . it's the god's truth .
he seen ya .
he likes ya .
and he said tonight only you'll do .
so he said to find ya , take ya to hanover street ... where he's waitin'for ya .
you're very pretty .
go on , then , get in . i'll take you there .
oh , i almost forgot .
my gentleman got you a present .
you like grapes?
yeah .
whoa !
your gentleman , he must be very refined .
very refined indeed .
get in . i'll take you there .
all right .
here we are .
i'm like a lady .
you are a lady .
your gaffer , does he want anything special?
just the usual , i expect .
now , this alley takes you to a yard .
my gentleman , he's quiet .
he doesn't like disturbances .
what i wanna know , right ... is a toff like him , how much is he offerin '?
here .
two florin .
that'll do me .
let me see ya .
go on .
down here?
yeah .
straight down .
straight down to the door at the end .
shh .
shh .
straight down there , yeah?
oops .
no !
bugger off ! .
you watch your mouth !
any more information?
my readers wanna know this stuff .
oh , do they?
found a piece of leather apron in her mouth?
no , mr. best , but if it's your fancy ... i'd be delighted to stuff your mouth with a piece of leather .
come on , give us a tip .
put your picture on the front page .
cover up !
you're supposed to do something about it !
this is ridiculous !
there's a bleeding murderer on the loose !
what about my wife?
this is annie .
yes .
another of the circle of friends .
annie chapman .
dark annie , they called her .
you still say this isn't the nichols boys?
did the constable show you the leather they found down by the water spout?
could be part of a butcher's apron .
leather apron .
dear god .
we could be looking for a butcher after all . i saw her .
this one?
yeah .
last night .
i saw her face .
don't trample over this area .
let us see the body !
come on , let us see !
oh , god .
there's your typical londoner ... imbued with the christian spirit of sympathy for his fellow man .
or fellow whore , in this case .
he's really outdone himself this time , hasn't he?
he not only severed the intestines ... he carefully arranged them around the neck and shoulders . i think he's taken more organs this time .
grapes again .
why grapes?
only polly and dark annie were given grapes .
only they were disemboweled in such a meticulous fashion .
this ain't killing for profit .
this is ritual .
yeah , but why grapes?
so they'll trust whatever he offers .
i've never fully understood that tradition .
they're for the ferryman ... who takes the body across the river into the land of the dead . if she don't have the money to pay him ... she'd have to wander forever , lost between the two worlds .
i need to consult a doctor .
are you ill , inspector?
a surgeon , to be specific .
the killer removed the victim's uterus and its attachments .
my god .
he's out of his mind .
that's very astute of you , sir . i don't appreciate sarcasm , inspector . i'm sorry , sir . i meant nothing by it .
you already have a surgeon at your disposal . i need a man with a strong stomach and a sober mind .
the police surgeon has neither .
no .
request denied .
why?
are you questioning my decision?
no , sir . i simply want to know why .
there's already too much nonsense and gossip in the press .
you start consulting doctors ... and all sorts of wild notions will be printed .
no one else is to see the bodies .
it is my honor ... to present this ... unique medical phenomenon .
until last week , mr. joseph merrick [ man whispers ]
john merrick . i beg your pardon .
mr. john merrick ... was an attraction at a sideshow .
now he's being cared for ... at england's leading hospital ... and with your generosity ... we will be able to continue to do so .
ladies and gentlemen ...
mr. john merrick .
turn around .
oh , please . i can't stand it .
oh !
he should have been killed at birth !
good health !
that'll be the last one , your royal highness .
these hands are a gift from god .
the psychotic patient is  pardon , sir .
you dr. ferral? i am , yes . i'm inspector abberline , assigned to whitechapel .
my lord , you're the ripper case .
am i right?
yeah .
jolly good .
you've come to the perfect place .
we've got butchers aplenty here .
i see . i could use the expertise of someone like yourself to help solve this case .
they tell me you're the best young surgeon in london .
really? i don't see how a reputable surgeon could know anything about it .
this country's overrun with foreigners .
orientals and ...
jews .
socialists trying to stir things up against our monarchy .
that's who you should be pursuing .
don't you think?
excuse me .
you don't belong here , do you?
i'm afraid dr. ferral suffers from the surgeon's malady .
and what's that , sir?
want of feeling .
he knows everything about anatomy ... and nothing about the soul .
how may i assist you , inspector?
well , forgive my ignorance , sir , but , um ... are you a surgeon? i was .
unfortunately , i suffered a brain seizure six months ago .
sorry to hear that , sir .
these days i limit myself to teaching .
so you see , i'm accustomed to answering questions , inspector .
well , sir ... could you tell me what sort of a knife , uh , would this be?
i think you mean to draw a liston knife . it's named for liston , who was a surgeon in the crimean war .
because there was no anesthetic on the battlefield ... he had to carry out these amputations very quickly .
uh ... do you , by any chance , have the police surgeon's report available?
yes , i do , sir .
may i?
we must keep this confidential .
of course .
there it is .
thank you .
hmm .
yes .
wouldn't someone have heard their screams?
not if you cut their throats first .
yes .
and how can you be sure they wouldn't react to seeing the liston knife?
grapes .
he offers them grapes first .
ah .
grapes are very tempting .
yes , of course .
they'd gobble them up , wouldn't they?
and he might offer them a drink to ease them down .
a drink laced with laudanum .
how do you know that? i found a sprig of grapes on both victims 'bodies ... and i smelled the laudanum on their lips .
laudanum is a derivative of opium .
apart from doctors and addicts , not many would recognize it .
how long have you chased the dragon , inspector?
well , these should help with the headaches .
and , um ... opium leeches minerals out of the body ... so i've also given you a tonic ... that will help to restore your appetite .
thank you very much , sir .
i'm a fool . i don't think you're a fool .
far from it . i ought to have known , sir , that you're physician ordinary to the royal family .
well , yes , it's certainly an honor ... but it's an honor bestowed on many doctors .
he cut their throats from left to right , therefore he's right handed .
excuse me .
he had to slice through four layers of tissue ... and up to an inch of subcutaneous fat .
after that ... he entered the abdominal cavity ... so he would have had to use more than just merely the liston knife .
perhaps he was carrying a portable amputation kit similar to this .
what do you think?
is it possible , sir , that the killer is an educated man ... perhaps someone who studied medicine ... but who is , in fact , not a surgeon himself?
the intestines are simple enough .
but , uh , the uterus?
the liver , especially .
hard to locate , unless you know what you're doing .
and he was working quickly , in the dark . i had held out hope that this ... monster was a veterinarian ... or a furrier or an ... [ chuckles ]
especially well educated butcher .
no , i must admit , if i were you ... i'd look for someone with a thorough knowledge of human anatomy .
damn him .
do you want me to suck it? i can suck the thames dry .
don't be frightened , dearie .
how far advanced is our grandson's malady?
uh , no lesions have appeared , ma'am .
there is some neural damage a slight trembling of the right hand .
but i'm hopeful more than hopeful that treatment will arrest the disease .
he seems to us to be suffering greatly in his mind . is the disease affecting his emotions?
yes , well , of course his mood is depressed ... because of the news of the diagnosis .
but that should improve as he regains his strength .
you are a true physician , sir william . in all ways , you attend to the health of our empire .
we are grateful .
thank you , ma'am .
if this is the beginning ... of a five pointed star
a bloodyjewish star .
withers ! inspector is talking , which means you are what? i'm listening , sir .
yes .
this area would form a likely point . i want double shifts within these streets until further notice .
and don't only worry about jews and butchers .
you stop anyone suspicious ... including well dressed gentlemen .
and by the way , withers ... the star of david has six points .
right .
once more into the breach , dear friends .
dismissed !
why have you called me here?
it's just it's just you say three more have to be killed .
i can't take it , sir . it's everywhere . it's in all the papers .
i'm just a simple chap , sir . i'm not a great man like you .
i just don't know where i am at ... anymore .
there , there , netley . i shall tell you where we are .
we are in the most extreme and utter region ... of the human mind .
a radiant abyss ... where men meet themselves . i don't understand that . i don't understand , sir .
hell , netley .
we are in hell .
let me go !
get your hands off me !
pull yourself together .
go on ! in with you !
sorry about that , inspector .
she's madly in love with me ... although she hides it well .
you said mcqueen killed your two friends .
so what are you doing here?
oh , i see .
women are butchered right and left , and you can't do piss about it .
and i'm the fool .
we're watching them .
can't arrest them without evidence , so we watch them .
what else can we do? i'll testify . if you keep meself and me friends alive , i'll testify .
to what , precisely?
that mcqueen said he'd cut me unless i pay him a pound a week .
no .
what you mean , no?
you asked me to testify .
are you worried i'll let you down? i won't . i promise i won't .
you testify against mcqueen , maybe he goes in for a year or two .
but his boys , they'll take their revenge on you and your friends . i can't let you do it .
it's your round this time .
i confess , i have an appetite .
one day , i'll be a great big round woman ... with a skinny little man for a husband .
and a dozen plump children , i imagine .
you think that's funny an unfortunate like me being a decent mother?
no , no , i didn't mean that . i didn't mean that at all .
you'll be a wonderful mother someday , mary .
honest . i can see it . i see you in a little cottage by the sea ... surrounded by children . i can see it , mary , clear as day .
i really do have visions , you know .
are you serious?
sergeant godley calls 'em my intuitions .
as a matter of fact ... i had one about you in this case .
you have visions about me?
what might those be?
i want you to think carefully .
besides mcqueen , besides these awful murders ... has anything else happened to you or perhaps to one of your friends ... that's a bit out of the ordinary?
ben kidney?
that's special branch she's describing , you know .
what the hell would ben kidney and special branch be doing in whitechapel?
wait a minute .
she's irish born , isn't she?
there's your answer .
a secret irish rebel .
that's why they would be after her , right?
they were after ann crook ... who was having an affair with a wealthy gentleman .
a man she bore a child .
a child that's now missing , along with its grandparents .
right .
drive on , please , driver .
you do not fuck with special branch .
they fuck with you .
i don't know what you're thinking , and i don't care to know .
inspector adderly .
mr. kidney wants to see me .
mr. kidney's gone , sir .
didn't say where .
could be for the night .
no .
he said he'd be back before 1 1 : 00 , and i should wait .
where are you going , sir?
he said i should wait in his office .
and what floor is mr. kidney's office on?
i don't know what floor , you bloody idiot ... because i haven't been to his fucking office yet , have i?
he told me to have the desk man let me up .
but i'm more than happy to stand here like a knob ... because you disobeyed ben kidney's order . it's the second floor on the right .
thanks .
free ireland !
free ireland !
get inside , sir !
just some gunpowder , sir .
that's all .
little more than a firework .
anyone go in or out?
yes , sir . i'm sorry , sir .
yes , uh
there's an inspector adderly in your office .
no , there's nothing missing here .
the bastards have been in here , sir . i can smell 'em .
no .
yes .
no , not together .
too suspicious .
you wait for me , and if she's in there you can go and visit her on your own . i'm going with you right now ... or i'm going to the newspapers .
i mean it .
there's a number of mental disorders for which it is necessary ... to remove the front part of the brain .
her records indicate that she was violent ... threatening to do harm to herself ... and others .
does she have any relations?
no , she's a ward of the state .
that's a lie .
listen to me .
you're under arrest .
you're here to assist my investigation .
keep your mouth shut . is that clear?
sorry , sir .
good .
what else do you know about her?
all we know is that she was an unfortunate ... who lived in the whitechapel district . i'd like to ask her a few questions .
you won't get any sense out of her .
i'm used to that .
hello , ann . i brought mary kelly .
do you remember mary kelly?
ann , you know me . i'm your best friend in all the world .
go away .
go away .
go away .
ann , i'm gonna find baby alice . i'm gonna take care of her .
alice is laughing to me .
laughing to me .
laughing to me all day long . it's all right . it's all right , darling .
what about her father?
have you seen alice's father , ann?
he's a prince .
a prince .
a prince !
a prince !
and i'm a queen . i'm a queen ! i'm a queen !
how do you know he was a painter?
he hired us to pose as artist models .
and what exactly does that entail?
artist models .
we stood very still so he could paint us .
what's the matter?
you think i was born a whore?
oh , i'm sorry . i'm an unfortunate , not a whore .
england doesn't have whores .
just a great mass of very unlucky women .
so , ann crook ... and the painter became lovers is that it?
he married her ... in a lovely catholic church saint savior's . i was a witness , as a matter of fact .
he married her in a catholic church .
what do you think they've done to baby alice?
special branch dumped her in bishopsgate?
yeah , as an unknown .
but why?
when i find out , i'll tell you .
take me to her .
you have to .
no , not yet . i need to know more first .
look here , i promise ... that i'll help you with baby alice , but not yet .
you gotta trust me on that , at least a little bit .
i do . i do trust you .
good .
do you have little ones , inspector?
no .
no .
ayear ago no , two years i'm sorry , more than two years my wife , um , passed away ... giving birth to what i'm told was a son . i'm sorry .
thanks .
i wanna show you some paintings on the way out , yeah?
are you gonna take me into the gallery?
why not?
come on .
did you see the look on her face? i think she stopped breathing .
she's a fright .
she has cold eyes . i feel like someone's walking over my grave .
there's one more painting i want you to see .
you know him , don't you?
those whom god has joined together , let no man put asunder . i pronounce ... that they be man and wife . in nomine patris , et filii , et spiritus sancti .
amen .
sir william gull , please .
sir william isn't receiving visitors .
uh
sir william? it's inspector abberline . i need to speak with you , sir .
sir william is ill .
can't receive any visitors .
i said ... you can't go in .
have anna bring us some tea , would you , please?
ah , well , i wish i could tell you , inspector ... that your story was fantastical .
unhappily , i cannot . i know for a fact that the prince has a taste in unfortunate women .
and i suppose it's more than possible that ... he concocted this elaborate deception ... to have some privacy while he indulged in his secret life .
but i know one reason i have for stating ... that prince edward being jack the ripper is just incomprehensible .
what's that , sir?
if you repeat what i'm about to tell you , both our lives are in jeopardy . indeed , i hope for your sake that what i'm about to say ... will steer you clear of the very real danger you're in . i think i'm well past the point of safe return , sir .
prince edward has syphilis .
not a pleasant state secret , but a vital one .
well , then that proves it . i couldn't understand why the prince was killing ann crook's friends ... especially so savagely , but ... he's not merely killing them .
he's punishing them .
he wants revenge .
don't you see , sir?
no , inspector , i don't see . i'm afraid your wild speculations about the prince's mental state ... clever though they may be ... cannot overcome the physical impossibility ... of his committing these crimes .
the disease is far enough along that ... the prince's hands tremble uncontrollably .
he's very weak , and the killings ofjack the ripper ... require sure hands and considerable vigor .
and have you forgotten the most telling fact?
whatever else the prince may be ... he knows little or nothing of human anatomy .
conduct the candidate to the center of the lodge and cause him to kneel ... for the benefit of prayer .
vouchsafe thine aid , almighty father of the universe ... to this , our present convention .
who is this?
a poor candidate in a state of darkness ... who comes of his own free will ... perfectly prepared , humbly soliciting ... to be admitted into the mysteries and privileges . in all cases of danger and distress ... in whom do you put your trust? in god .
how did he find out about the unfortunate and her child?
well , he has that kind of cleverness ... you'll sometimes find in the middle classes .
a cheap sort of intelligence , but effective nevertheless .
hmm .
thank god that's not something you're burdened by .
yes , thank god .
recite the solemn oath .
never to reveal our secrets ... under no less a penalty than ... my throat be cut across ... my tongue be torn out by its root ... and that i be buried in sand ... a cable's length from shore .
you don't think gull is confiding in him , do you?
the old fellow isn't as far gone as all that , is he?
no .
he's not that foolish .
let the brother receive the light .
'another beautiful murder will be committed by me . " [ second man's voice ]
fear me . jack the ripper .
they're rubbish , you know that .
yes , i agree .
they're rubbish .
though why you persist in believing that red haired jezebel , i'll never know .
have you considered that she's the sort of woman who likes to make up stories ... particularly about men?
she is , after all , a whore .
she's a woman who
a rose by any other name . " is that it?
frederick , my dear chum , no one is more delighted than i am ... that you've decided to resume your interest in the fairer sex ... but please remember ... a woman like that can make a man feel whatever she wants him to feel .
sergeant godley .
yes , sir .
arrest the nichol street gang .
right away , inspector . i tried to stop them , inspector .
this arrived with this afternoon's post .
open it up ! " i send you half the kidney i took from one woman , preserved for you .
t'other piece i fried and ate . it was very nice .
we demand something be done , and done tonight . " from hell .
well , at least they got the address right . it can't be .
are you sure he was the same? i know him . i posed for him twice meself . i stood there naked as a babe watching him paint me for hours .
and he was with ann for what over a year?
nearly two .
ah , here you are .
hello , girls .
where have you been? i told you to wait for me . i can't stay in a pub and not have a drink .
that's cruel .
but look who i bumped into .
remember ada?
she's from france .
bruxelles .
bruxelles .
yes .
oh , she is pretty , isn't she?
not in public , love .
not in public .
would you give us a minute alone?
we need to speak with liz .
no , ada , you stay where you are .
come , mary .
get a drinksy .
mary .
you don't have to worry about nichol street for at least a week . i can keep 'em that long .
well , that's something , anyway .
thank you .
yeah .
baby alice , she's all right?
yeah , she's all right .
we'll get her out after this is over .
we'll get her .
listen . i want you and your friends off the streets until i can sort this thing out .
off the streets?
for how long?
a few days , at least .
well , you better throw us in jail then ...
'cause we have no money for food and no money for a doss .
all right .
you take this .
buy some food , get a room and stay there .
don't tell anyone where you're going . i don't want to know . in three days , come to the ten bells . i'll leave a message with the barkeep .
what? it's not enough? i wish i could show you the little village where i was born . it's so lovely there . it's by the sea , the way you said you saw me . i used to think it too small to spend a life in ... but now i'm not so sure .
don't .
don't .
what?
do you think i'm paying you back? i didn't mean it as business . i'm still a woman .
they haven't taken that away from me .
not yet , anyways .
enough of that .
now , lad , at least take
sorry , sir .
there , milady .
one more time .
and curtsy .
and we're done .
oh , don't be modest , girl .
they don't care what we do .
i paid for your supper , remember .
stop shaking your head at me , you slag !
leave her alone .
she is my business .
she's not yours .
liz, just be quiet for one bloody night .
no , i fucking won't keep my voice down !
calm down !
they'll call the landlord on us .
don't go out . it's not safe . i need something to sustain myself . i will be right back .
liz , don't be so fucking stupid !
do without for a night .
no . i want a fucking drink .
liz !
here we are .
service records .
grenadier guards .
lieutenant benjamin kidney .
there, just as you suspected .
before he joined special branch ...
ben kidney served in the grenadier guards .
part of his duties included assisting the field surgeon .
let me tell you something , inspector , of which i'm absolutely certain .
assisting an expert is different very , very different from doing it oneself .
think about it .
someone's gotta clean up after the prince .
and whose job is it to take care of the widow's messes?
you've turned into othello .
do you know that?
everything is a suspicion .
and like that tragic moor ... all your suspicions will end up in your own demise .
for heaven's sake , man , these women aren't just being silenced .
they're being murdered most brutally .
why would ben kidney do that?
to scare people .
to keep their mind off the real point .
which is?
think what's at stake for special branch .
prince edward married ann crook , a commoner and a catholic .
married her in a catholic church .
they had a baby .
a legitimate baby , who is , in fact , heir to the throne of england .
all these women were there .
all these women were eyewitnesses to an event ... that could rip the empire to pieces .
when she starts drinking , she'll go all night .
you know that .
but she knows how dangerous it is .
she don't believe you about the prince .
she thinks you're feeding that copper candies to keep him interested .
hello , sir . is anything wrong , my dear?
no , sir .
for a moment , i thought you were someone else .
oh .
thirsty?
always parched , sir .
perhaps there is somewhere nearby that we might go ... while my coachman keeps watch .
oh , yeah .
yeah .
this way .
follow me .
yeah , it's this way .
follow me .
i dropped my grapes .
oh !
no !
what the fuck are you looking at , lipski?
shut up !
shut up !
sir !
all right , george , that's enough .
it's one of them , isn't it?
throat's cut the same way .
yeah .
he didn't finish .
well , she's no less dead for that .
he won't be satisfied by this .
wilkins?
fetch the ambulance .
go on , run along .
excuse me , miss .
you could be dead ... right now .
but then there would be too many bloody questions .
ignore the old man's blathering .
find a scapegoat .
or next time we won't care who asks ...
whatever happened to inspector abberline?
we should hurry up , sir . it's clearin 'up .
do you have a piece of chalk , netley?
chalk , sir?
they found another one in mitre square !
bastards !
they did another one !
i heard he cut off her nose this time .
nice work , inspector .
you've encouraged him to do two a night now .
out of the fucking way , cunt .
katherine eddowes .
there's some writing on a wall just down the road there .
you should have a look at it .
the juwes'are the men that will not be blamed for nothing . " it's hardly shakespeare , but it'll do .
i was busy with the children
madame , slow down .
slow down .
make sure you get the apron as well , yeah?
it was written by the killer , sir .
and how do you know that? i was here three quarters of an hour ago .
this building mostlyjews live here , is that right?
yeah , that's right .
ready now , sir .
put that away and get out of here immediately .
abberline .
yeah?
wash that off .
what?
you heard me . it's evidence , sir .
listen to me . in another hour , there will be a thousand people poking about in here . if those words are seen , not a jew in london will be safe .
we'll have mayhem on the streets .
so wash it off ! .
that's an educated hand , sir .
an educated man wrote that .
look for yourself . i don't have to look . i've seen it .
an educated man knows how to spell " jews . " i don't know what this refers to , but i'm sure it's got nothing to do ... with the people who live around here .
sergeant , i want two constables to wash that off .
what are you looking to him for?
wash it off ! .
yes , sir .
half a dozen men have seen it already .
the sergeant has copied it down . i'll remember these words for as long as i live .
so all you're doing is destroying its value as evidence .
no , all i'm doing is taking charge of an investigation ... that you have bungled to the point of gross inefficiency ... and i've had enough .
you are suspended from duty , abberline .
inspector abberline is suspended .
all his privileges are cancelled .
yes , sir .
you've not seen her , then?
well , if she comes around , give her this .
long letter , eh?
this is for your trouble .
the letter's private .
you understand? i understand .
right .
where's this?
recite the solemn oath .
never to reveal our secrets [ screaming ]
grapes again .
why grapes?
this ain't killing for profit .
he's not that foolish .
you oughta be botherin'mcqueen .
are you questioning my decision?
find a scapegoat .
this is ritual .
jubela, jubelo, jubelum .
juwes .
it's me , ada .
me .
only me .
i bring everything for supper .
you little thief . i need this money . i just take some money and buy food for me and for you . is that bad , marie? it's fine , dear .
you're a good person , but listen .
until i go away from london , it's not safe for you to go out .
understand? i stay with marie .
beautiful marie . it's all right , darling .
you don't have to pay for your food .
pardon?
here's to our feast .
i'm so sorry to greet you like this , inspector , but but i'm rather late for an appointment .
will you excuse me if i finish dressing while we talk?
no , no .
please , go on .
thank you .
i'd like to speak to you about the freemasons if i might , sir .
the arrangement of the coins at dark annie's feet ... and also the locations of the bodies ... form a pentacle star .
a pentacle star is a symbol of the freemasons , is it not , sir?
yes .
and the way that all these women were killed throats cut left to right ... organs removed .
they're reenactments , aren't they , sir?
reenactments of what?
thejuwes .
the traitors who killed hiram abiff , founder of the masons that's how they were executed .
ah , yes .
so the great book tells us .
sojack the ripper isn't just merely killing whores .
he's executing traitors .
he's a mason fulfilling a duty .
yes , i'm afraid , inspector ... that you won't be permitted to arrest him . i don't want to arrest him .
the ripper has one more traitor yet to kill ... and i will stop him .
did they come to you , sir ... as a loyal mason?
did they ask you to help them cover up the prince's secret marriage?
that's how it started , yes .
and then you discovered the prince had syphilis .
he's going to die of it , inspector .
would you like a tour of the syphilis wards?
you're a physician ordinary to the queen ... entrusted with the well being of the heir to the throne .
only you ... had reason to believe that these unfortunates ... these whores ... these ... traitors ... destroyed your life's work .
below the skin of history ... are london's veins .
these symbols the mitre , the pentacle star even someone as ignorant ... and degenerate as you ... can sense that they course with energy and meaning .
i am that meaning . i am that energy .
one day , men will look back ... and say i gave birth to the 20th century .
you're not going to see the 20th century .
roll up his sleeve .
don't struggle .
you'll only make this more painful .
you all right , mate?
dr. gull .
yes !
you were describing the human heart .
yes .
yes .
the human heart ... is a dense and powerful muscle ... much like the organic equivalent of mahogany .
and notoriously difficult ... to burn .
about the size of a fist ... it provides the motor power for the circulatory system .
the heart contains two atria , two ventricles ... and four valves .
it is , in effect , a single pump ... powering a double circuit .
in the adult the heart rate averages 70 to 80 beats a minute .
such is the force of the heartbeat ... that if the body's largest artery , the aorta , is severed ...
a six foot jet of blood ... is released .
let the brother receive the light .
for you fear no god , arise .
your faith is well founded .
don't .
don't go in there .
there's no need .
how bad is it?
she's she's in pieces , sir .
sergeant , he can go in .
give him to me !
he'll be taken care of , i swear to it . i want him .
he's done . i give you my word .
fuck your word ! i'll bring every last one of you fucking cunts down .
you and your fucking brothers !
now , listen to me , abberline .
your situation your difficult situation has been thoroughly discussed .
you are reinstated . indeed , you are promoted .
no !
no .
come on .
this is not helping anything .
come on !
come on .
don't be a fool , inspector .
you will be very closely watched .
yeah, you're all there now , ain't ya?
where were you when this was happening? it's all right for you , standing around there chatting .
what about us? inspector abberline is in charge .
give him all the assistance he requires .
no !
remember, you're being watched .
all right , come on , you men .
clear this passage .
come on .
move 'em away .
move back !
back !
shall we proceed , inspector?
body lies in middle of bed .
shoulders flat , but axis of body inclined toward right .
the left arm is close to the body ... the forearm flexed at a right angle ... resting across the abdomen .
the right arm is slightly abducted from the body . it rests on the mattress with the elbow bent ... and the forearm supine .
the fingers are clenched , indicating a struggle as she died .
notice something , inspector?
no .
no , go on .
came in not long before dawn .
a bit of a rush .
left this for ya .
i know you asked me to wait . if i'm to be murdered , i'd like at least to die in my village . i'm going to the orphanage to collect baby alice .
here's an address where you can find us .
we'll wait for you eagerly . i know i know in my heart ... we can be happy living by the sea ... just as you saw . i hope to be with you soon , dearest .
all my love , mary .
we are deeply distressed , lord hallsham .
we are deeply distressed , lord hallsham .
we asked sir william to remove a threat to our family and to our throne ... not to engage in these ghastly rituals .
oh , no , of course not , your majesty .
that was unexpected .
on the other hand , he has fulfilled his duties .
the threat is passed , your majesty . in his way sir william has been loyal ... and we are grateful for that .
the rest is in your hands , lord hallsham .
we wish to hear nothing further of this .
knight of the east ... we are gathered here beneath the god of love ... and before the sight of the great architect to judge this case .
you stand accused of mayhems that have placed our brotherhood in jeopardy .
you stand before your peers masons and doctors both . i have no peers present here .
what?
no man amongst you is fit to judge ... the mighty art that i have wrought .
your rituals are empty oaths you neither understand ... nor live by .
the great architect speaks to me .
he is the balance where my deeds are weighed and judged ... not you .
knight of the east ... hear our judgement .
well , they're not watching you anymore .
i'm telling you , it's safe to go to her .
they think she's dead . if i disappear or change my routine suddenly ... they might wonder why .
you know who you're gonna turn into , don't you?
that boring old bugger in the pub that nobody wants to sit beside .
'cause as soon as he's had a few drinks , he goes on and on ... about the girl that got away .
do you want to live the rest of your life like a ghost?
no .
what i want is to go to her .
but at the slightest hint that she's alive , they will spare no expense no expense and no trouble .
so i stay ... and watch them .
alice !
alice !
come in , darling .
coming , mother .
get up .
get up !
come on .
good night , sweet prince .
