shadows in paradlse
friday !
take it .
i'm driving .
listen , nikander .
we've been a team for quite a while .
but i've been doing this for 25 years .
i'm getting tired , and so's the old heart .
what's the matter?
never mind .
i've got an idea my own company .
five trucks to start with ...
where does it end?
the sky's the limit .
the state and the banks will back us .
i know everything about this game but i'm not going to die behind the wheel .
where , then?
behind a desk .
and i need a good foreman .
32 . 70 .
you're bleeding !
yes , i hurt my hand .
we'll put a plaster on it .
coming out tonight?
where?
somewhere with some fun .
yea .
how was the weekend?
great !
i had a hell of a time !
have you thought about it?
everything's ready .
the bank's with us and we've got a garage .
maybe i should go on a course .
fine !
do whatever you think .
i promised my wife way back that with me , she would get to see the world ... ... it's about time .
i can be a driver , too .
or whatever , if you think i can manage .
sure you can !
reliable garbage disposal since 1986 .
but that's now !
that's why it catches the eye !
pretty smart !
isn't it .
who can put out the flame once it starts to blaze
underneath the hot , hot sun
on life's highway you can see many pretty will o 'the wisps
but there's only one i truly miss ...
another one .
no more !
no?
good morning .
dammit !
my neck's stiff .
what happened?
i'm not at work !
where are we?
the door's locked .
it usually is , in jail .
i'll lose my job .
do you come here often?
no , never .
you're ok then .
i don't have a job at all .
you don't?
why?
why do you think?
we got a spare job yesterday .
maybe you could get it .
what's your job?
garbage truck driver .
ok .
melartin .
nikander .
see you in the morning .
make it at six tomorrow morning .
you'll have to do a week's trial .
bloody great .
now i've just got to call the wife .
tell her you got a job .
won't help .
she'll hit me anyway .
why drink then?
it makes me feel good .
things seem to be fine .
they do?
yea .
how about another?
no .
why not?
i'll call her after it .
if it helps .
if you've got a problem ...
who , me?
who says so?
nobody .
of course not .
hello .
hi .
i've been wondering who takes that away .
it's only me .
is your hand better?
yes , it's fine now .
will you come out with me tomorrow?
i'm working till eight .
that's ok .
alright then .
i'll be here at eight .
good night .
what are those for?
my brother's leaving school today .
but you don't have a brother !
i've got a weird migraine : gotta go .
what's the rush?
let's have a drink .
i'm in a hurry .
hi .
come on in .
what's the matter with you?
why?
you look nervous .
bullshit !
don't you eat around this time?
not today , the wife's out .
then you're in no hurry home .
none at all .
how about a beer?
no way .
why?
doctor's orders !
a barefaced lie !
admirable !
see you .
bye .
evening .
evening .
where shall we go?
you choose .
bertha one .
i van twenty seven .
i van nineteen .
hey !
yes?
wait !
i don't think it'll work out .
what won't?
anything .
morning .
how was it?
what !?
104 . 95 .
you're wanted downstairs .
no one can predict how the market forces change .
sometimes you have too much staff , sometimes too little .
but i'd have liked to keep you here with us .
sure !
but there's nothing i can do about it .
i just sit here and watch the sales graph ...
there must be a new supermarket around here with all their special offers and so on ...
so our sales will go down temporarily .
i'm afraid you'll have to go .
the supermarket's a merciless machine .
your daughter finishes school in two weeks .
she needs a job .
you don't fool me .
you can stay the two weeks .
and the flat?
two weeks .
that's all .
i think i'll leave now .
then you lose two weeks 'salary .
thanks a lot .
that guy is crazy .
what do you mean?
i got fired .
you did?
yes .
why?
just because .
oh shit .
hi .
well , hi !
let's go .
where?
for a drive , out of town .
what , now?
ok .
but i must see a friend first .
why?
that's my business .
let's go then .
hi .
lend me some money and a clean shirt , will you?
ok .
give me 500 .
i haven't got it .
you just got paid yesterday !
i paid the food bill .
damn you .
find a clean shirt , will you?
good evening .
we saw the vacancy sign .
one double , is it?
no , two singles .
please fill these in .
are you coming in?
now what ...
nikander?
i don't know .
are you hungry?
yes .
let's go to a restaurant and eat .
i must change then .
ok .
change .
i'll see you in the corridor .
not bad , is it?
it's fine .
do you find it dull here?
with me , i mean .
why?
just asking .
take it easy .
everything's ok tonight .
i don't know about tomorrow , though .
maybe the weather will turn , or something .
what do you want from me anyway?
who me?
yes , you .
more wine?
answer me !
i don't want anything from anybody !
i'm nikander .
ex butcher , now a garbage truck driver !
bad teeth and stomach , liver hanging on !
more than i can say about my head !
no use asking what i want .
i only asked .
you're welcome .
it's cold here .
really?
i hadn't noticed .
good night .
thanks for the evening .
come in .
breakfast .
what's that?
supermarket's cashbox , but it's locked .
show me .
is there money in it?
yes .
how much?
how should i know?
i can't get it open .
wait , don't do a thing .
all you ever gave me was sorrow and pain
but that's alright , i can hide my ache .
i won't let people know for if you leave me now
my heart will cry but it mustn't show .
what shall i do with the money?
there's too much of it , you'll have to give it back .
it was revenge .
it's the third job i've been thrown out of this year .
i wanted to go to florida but i missed the plane .
anyway , i couldn't get the box open .
my aunt's been to florida all she saw was some finns and donald ducks .
they must know i took it .
i'll take care of that .
that would be great .
do you know what you're doing?
of course .
ilona rajamki?
if you didn't take the money why won't you tell us where you've been since you left work on saturday?
it's none of your business , that's why .
you haven't been to your flat , we have witnesses .
witnesses?
your ex workmates .
when you were fired you left right away .
you were very upset .
a cash box disappeared .
sounds bad , doesn't it?
that depends .
you're the only suspect .
shall i go through the questions again?
don't bother .
i ...
yes?
what do you want me to say?
don't say anything .
say that i went back where i came from .
i thought you were a local .
no .
where're you from , then?
down the street .
i'll say you just took off .
fine .
see you .
how much for a single?
300 marks , with breakfast .
and without?
the same .
i'll take it .
no way .
why?
we're full .
why didn't you say so?
is ilona there?
no .
she should be !
yes , but she left .
where?
she didn't say .
i see .
so long .
we're closing .
i must go to work .
i'll stay here and sleep .
here are some sheets and a towel .
right .
i must go .
it's beautiful .
what is?
the sun , the sea and the birds .
gimme a light .
remember that chick from the supermarket?
guess where she is now?
no .
sleeping in my bed .
get back there , then !
i can't .
what's keeping you?
horror , fear and this work shift .
i'll take care of things .
thanks .
haven't you learned to knock?
this is my flat .
what's your first name?
i'm not telling .
something wrong with it?
might be .
come here .
you've just got yourself a job .
our employees have to be punctual .
my secretary will show you your duties .
i hope we'll work together well .
evening .
good evening .
will you be dining?
yes .
unfortunately the restaurant is full .
is it good?
it's alright .
want to go home?
why not .
you can try it on over there .
hi .
what are you doing here?
i came to see where you're working .
nice looking place .
how about a coffee?
i'm busy , see you this evening .
who was he?
who?
the shit collector .
he's only my cousin .
please arrange to meet him somewhere else .
i think i'll take a walk .
i'll just finish doing these .
i'd rather go alone .
lend me some cheese .
when will you pay me back?
i'll get liver pt tomorrow .
go ahead .
thanks .
mother in law's babysitting tonight .
really?
we could go out , the four of us .
where?
movie first , then a bar .
get drunk .
ilona won't come .
tell her she must !
i'll order her to come !
she seems to be late .
sure does .
i'll wait for her .
take your tickets .
we gotta go now .
can you make it home?
i always make it home .
good night .
good night .
well?
what?
let's have it .
what?
i didn't turn up yesterday .
and not later , either .
i noticed .
is that all you have to say?
yes .
pig !
that's pretty weak .
isn't it?
if you've got a bad conscience , i can't help .
why should i have?
how should i know?
maybe you just got lost , maybe not !
i'll go in the morning .
why?
don't you like it here?
it's not that .
alright but why wait till morning?
are you sick?
yes , mentally .
but we've still gotta collect the shit .
no way .
i'll make you some coffee .
bring me booze !
you'll get fired without a doctor's certificate .
the kind of doctor i need hasn't been born yet .
are you coming?
are you still seeing that dustman?
no .
he was a bit ugly , anyway .
what do you mean?
he wasn't .
really ugly .
but nice .
maybe a bit strange .
at least he wasn't as dumb as your men .
they can't even chew gum and walk at the same time .
but nikander can?
a lot of other things , too .
but it's too late now .
three sixes .
why do i keep losing?
you've got no desire to win .
so what?
you've got a kid .
that's right .
how does it feel?
it's ok .
want me to smash you face in?
who , you?
no .
that's what i thought .
why?
why not?
want to buy a video recorder?
i've got one .
i can sell you one .
i don't need another one !
for your kitchen .
my wife's in there , with the washing machine .
she could watch it while she's cooking .
are you out of your mind or something?
i don't think so .
want to go out for a beer tonight?
can't , the wife's going .
they always do .
three twos .
i was pretty well through with the subject .
i'd probably considered it from most of its various angles including the one that certain injuries or imperfections are a subject of merriment while remaining quite serious with the person possessing them .
it's funny .
it's very funny .
and it's a lot of fun , too , to be in love .
do you think so?
it's funny .
it's very funny .
and it's a lot ...
hello .
hi .
i was just passing by .
yes?
how are you , old man?
alright .
want me to smash your face in?
no .
get lost then , we've got to talk .
i'll wait in the car .
i'm sorry .
you've become violent .
true .
are you busy?
a little .
i bet you are .
i'm going to see my sister .
she was studying in stockholm now she's in a mental hospital .
want to come with me?
i don't think so .
i've been so lonely .
want to go back inside?
yes .
you're very quiet .
we tried to come here once , but couldn't get in .
why didn't you call the manager?
what , us?
i think i'll go .
why?
i feel like going .
let's go to my place you haven't been there yet .
thanks for the evening .
staffan , look at that .
what's up?
you got a cigarette , friend?
hello .
what's the matter?
hello .
it's nothing .
let's have a smoke .
when will they let you out?
i don't know .
they want to do some more tests on me .
how're things at work?
ok .
mikkonen busted his truck yesterday .
we had to do his round , too .
overtime , right?
right .
120 marks an hour .
have you called ilona?
no .
why not?
good question .
did you come by car?
yes .
i'll get my clothes .
i've come to take you away .
where?
for a honeymoon .
life's too hard for you alone .
you think so?
maybe you're right .
of course .
shall we go?
but my job ...
we'll get you a new one later .
what do you think?
looks good .
pay at the cashier .
do you want to buy something?
who's he?
i don't know .
if you're not buying anything i ...
get lost .
you heard him .
don't try it !
can we live on your money?
alright then where are we going?
they have these cruises to tallinn .
i'll get my coat .
look up , my little friend
see , the park is brightly lit .
my poor heart longs for you
it's beating here all alone .
so hurry , please , oh , hurry home
man's life is oh so short .
hurry to me , my love , my own
you give me everything .
hurry , please , hurry to me
everything here is yours .
but my friend , although i ask
i know it's all in vain .
even though i long for you
day and night , don't run to me .
don't , because you know it too
life would only bring us pain .
don't hurry now back to me
the shadows here would swallow you .
hurry not , see the beautiful world
because here you wouldn't see for tears .
