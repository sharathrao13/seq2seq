no need to apologize .
now , miss hall , my associate has your necklace in a very safe place .
but obviously we do feel the alarm should have gone offa little sooner .
lsn 't that right , miss hall?
hmm?
oh , absolutely .
much , much too long , i'd say .
under the circumstances , i think we'd recommend ... resetting the sensors to respond to a lighter load .
how do you feel about 40 kilos , miss hall?
perfect .
shall we?
miss hall .
hmm?
haven't you forgotten something?
what are you trying to do , senorita?

the thought had crossed my mind .
i'm missing something here , aside from my half million pound necklace .
even after i screwed up thejob ,
i could've walked out ofthere with the bloody thing .
at least you walked .
why did you watch me go through it all?
i wanted to see how good you were .
i was hoping we might work together .

just as in the old days , huh?
whenyousa ved our lives , sa ved our very sanity .
dmitri ... we have this little problem .
every search for a hero ... must begin with something that every hero requires a villain .
therefore , in thesearch forour hero , bellerophon , we created a monster , chimera .
i beg you , dmitri , come to sydney and accompany me to atlanta immediately .
ho wever we tra vel , lmust arrive at my destination ... within 20hours ofdeparture .
i fear i can entrust this to no one but you .
dmitri , as we say , i'm sorry andyou're sorry .
do you have any idea what the hell he's talking about?
an idea?
yeah .
like?
like it 's agoodidea topick him up in a hurry ... and a bad idea to fly him on a commercial carrier .
is he still in sydney?
dr. vladimir nekhovich is dead .
so is his colleague gradski , but that happened earlier .
we had nekhovich on a flight from sydney that crashed in the rockies .
dead?
are you listening to me?
if he didn't want to go anywhere without me , how did you get him on that flight?
oh , you were there .
when lcouldn 't findyou , lhadto replaceyou .
seanambrose was the obvious choice .
no w , he doubledyou , what , two orthree times?
twice .
what did you think of him?
we had our reservations about each other .
isn't it a little late to be asking me that?
no , not necessarily .
airline records ...
list a captain harold macintosh as the pilot offlight 2207 .
as fa r as the media and all government agencies are concerned ,
captain macintosh died on the flight .
but , in fact , he missed it .
he did , however , make the next flight ... in cargo .
stuffed into a rather small suitcase , considering his size .
now , someone on that flight planned an operation ... designed to bring theplane do wn andmake it looklike an accident .
someone skillfu i enough to bring the whole thing off without a hitch .
so there's one thing we know that ambrose doesn't .
you do think it was ambrose?
you're not surprised?
sean feels he hasn't done thejob unless he leaves a lot of hats on the ground .
the question is why?
what was this , uh , chimera , nekhovich was carrying?
only ambrose knows that .
in any case , you must recover this whatever chimera , and bring it to us .
in order to do that , i have to fii gure out how he plans to make money with it .
that is where miss hall comes in .
excuse me?
miss hall and ambrose had a relationship ... which he took very seriously .
she walked away , and he's been wanting her back ever since .
we believe she's our surest and quickest way of locating him .
and then what?
well , make sure she continues to see him , gets him to confii de in her , and report to you .
you made it sound as if i was recruiting her for her skills as a thief .
well , then i misled you , oryou made the wrong assumption .
either way , we're asking her to resume a prior relationship , not do anything she hasn't already done .
voluntarily , lmight add .
no , she's got no training for this kind ofthing .
what , to go to bed with a man and lie to him?
she's a woman .
she's got all the training she needs .
i don't think i can get her to do it .
you mean it'll be diffii cult .
very .
well , this is not mission diffii cult , mr. hunt , it's mission impossible .
diffii cult should be a walk in the park foryou .
i'm open to suggestion .
lfyou can think ofa quicker way , you're welcome to try .
you might take a lookat these ... ifyou have any further qualms aboutgetting her to do thejob .
****** [ woman vocalizing ]
how many people are capable ofsomething like that?
sean ambrose , for one .
right .
this wasn't what i had in mind , nyah .
but it is what you'd like me to do .
what?
oh , let my conscience be my guide , is that it?
something like that .
i don't have a conscience .
i'm a bloody thief .
are you gonna try and force me to do this?
generally , i don't favor coercing someone , not when there's a chance my life could end up in their hands .
is that the only reason?
can you think ofa better one?
me?
no .
but i wasjust hoping that you might , thinking that somewhere , this got personal as well as physical !
would it make you feel any better if i didn't want you to do this?
yeah , much .
then feel better !
you know , sean will never be anything butsuspicious ... iflpitch up saying , " hey , honey , i'm home .
what wouldn't make him suspicious?
that i needed him in some urgent way .
destitute .
in serious trouble .
the kind i couldn't possibly sort out myself .
serious trouble , nyah , is something that i can always arrange .
this transponder chip is completely untraceable .
it transmitsyour location to a satellite ... which can be read by only this computer .
we can then trackyou to within three feet .

every search fora hero ... must begin with something that every hero requires a villain .
therefore , in the search for our hero , bellerophon , we created a monster , chimera .
nekhorvich was a molecularbiologist .
why is he going on about an old greek myth?
nekhorvich specialized in recombining dna molecules .
in the myth ,
bellerophon was aprince who killed the chimera .
a monster with the headofa lion ... andthe tail ofa serpent ... whoplagued the ancient world .
i think nekhorvich created a monster virus named chimera ... andthe antivirus to kill it , named bellerophon .
that simple , huh?
why not?
$$37 million .
now , that's a promising bid for nekhorvich's work .
don't look so worried , hugh .
we're halfway there .
we'll need this at the track ... ifwe're gonna get the other half .
well , then ... sorted .
not everything .
why do you think she's really here?
from her point ofview or mine?
well , she wasn't exactly gagging for it ... when she left you six months ago .
the question is , do you trust her?
one considers her timing , ofcourse .

suppose she is some sort oftrojan horse sent in by imf to spy on us .

you crashed on the plane .
you're dead .
dead , certainly .
but dead is a little extreme .
on the other hand , when my colleague gradski had your pulse ... and your blood pressure , he had less than a day to live .
you are infected with chimera , my friend .
no use , my friend .
the medicalstaff wants nopart ofthis .
doctors don't fa ncy the idea ofdying any more than anybody else .
how could i possibly be infected?
that's exactly what gradski said 27 hours before he died .
you've got the antidote , you miserable bastard !
you stole bellerophon !
all of it !
my , my , my .
lneed it ! lneed it now , you whacked out russian gypsy !
and what about gradski , who you deliberately infected with chimera?
how was i to know they needed ... to be treated with bellerophon within 20 hours?
by asking me .
youstill don't get it , doyou?
i needed to knowjust how bad the disease was in the real world , notjust the lab .
you were genetically splicing together strains of influenza ... to create a cure forall influenzas .
butyou were also creating a disease so terrible in chimera , the cure would be priceless .
lneeded chimera in order topeddle bellerophon .
it's not that diffii cult to understand , is it?
look , i've got the virus .
you've got the cure .
lneed them both .
time was a shot of penicillin would knock off ... every bloody bug in the zoo .
not anymore .
lfl couldn 't make money killing the microscopic little shits out there , well , you'd help me put one out there that i could make money on .
well , there it is .
i've confessed .
i, john c. mccloy , am in business to make money .
no w , forget any dealyou may have made with that thugambrose .
get me treated , and let's go back to work .
you know ,
i think it's a little late for that .
dogive my regards to gradski ... ifyou see him .
well ...
i've heard ...
all i need to hear .
nyah ... it's imperative that we do nothing to alarm ambrose .
what?
you told me to get out ofthere as soon as possible .
i thought you were here to collect me !
shh , shh , shh , shh , shh !
listen to me .
there's no time to talk .
it is critical , absolutely critical , that you do whatever ambrose asks .
do you understand me?
don't worry .
it will all be over ... very soon .
that's a promise .
go on .
go on .
off you go .
luther , we know this much .
nekhorvich gets on a plane ... to go to the center for disease control in atlanta .
he's carrying a virus he created , chimera , and the cure for that virus , bellerophon .
ambrose doesn't have the virus .
that's why ambrose needs mccloy .
so we go into biocyte , kill chimera ,
ambrose has a cure without a disease , and we're home free .
you were right .
huntstung mccloy tonight .
so he knows .
he'll be going into biocyte .
good .
then we'll know where he'll be , don't we?
well done , hugh .
well done .

sorry , but this is a biocyte facility .
their storage structure .
i'll have it up in a minute .
okay , take a look at this .
start from the inside out .
all storage and production of chimera is done here , in this lab on the 42ndfloor .
hunt's target will be the chimera , stored and manufactured at biocyte on the 42nd floor .
ifyou look at hunt's operational history , and i have , he invariably favors misdirection over confrontation .
he 'll never breakinto biocyte from the bottom where security is hea viest .
no garage entrances .
lobby's protected by fiive guards on rotating patrol .
not goin 'in from the ground .
show me the atrium .
the atrium?
one ofa kind .
runs do wn through the center ofthe building .

ends in aglass floor which doubles aspart ofthe lab ceiling .
uh uh .
the atrium roof closes at sundown .
andifthe louvers are up for more than 40 seconds at night , the civil emergency alarms are tripped .
those , even lcan't stop .
ethan , we have a total of40 seconds ... to get you in and the cables out .
no , hunt willprefer to enter biocytesomewhere from the top ... where security is minimal .
he'll undoubtedly engage in some aerobatic insanity ... before he'll risk harming a hair on a security guard's head .
check check .
got copy?
you're fiive by fiive .
luther , how we doin '?
not thereyet , ethan .
i'llgiveyou the word .
billy , ready to go?
okay , package away in five
i'm not ready .

he 'll breach the lab at the onlypossible time , whetheryou break in from the ground or the roof .
it's 2300 hours , one minute ... when the air fii ltration generators will cover the sound of hunt's break in ... and the rotating guards make the building vulnerable ... to our break in from below .
ethan , thegenerator's about togo active .
just a friendly reminder .
we'll be out ofcontact for eight minutes .
he'll have to do it in two places .
first , the incubation room where the growth vials are kept .
andfinally , in the inoculation chamber ... holding the last remaining chimera virus in three injectionguns .
he won't be allowed to destroy the virus in those guns .

hope he kills all the bugs before the yellow dot gets to the red one .
ho wever we tra vel ,
lmust arrive at my destination within 20hours ofdeparture .
ho w was lto know that he needed to be treated ... with bellerophon within 20hours?
get him .
how much longer before you can reach him?
we 've got29 seconds before thegenerators turn off , then ethan will be back on line .
ahh !
luther !
luther !
holdyour fire !
hold your fii re , damn it !
well , hunt ... how've you been?
fighting a bit ofa cold .
aww .
you know , that was the hardest part of having to portray you grinning like an idiot every 1 5 minutes .
i would've thought the hardest part was curbing that pressing need ofyours ... to get your gun off .
you were in such a hurry to knock off that 747 ... you never fii gured out where chimera really was .
i knew where it was .
oh .
then you knew the only way nekhorvich could smuggle the live virus ... is by injecting himselfandusing his own bloodstream as apetri dish .
you knew that ... while you were knocking him off , destroying the very thing you came for .
stop !
put a sock in it !
hit that bloody gun , and you'll spray the virus all over the place !
there it is , guys .
the last of it .
what was the top bid?
why?
you gonna make me a better offer?
than $$37 million?
not really .
oh !
somebody has been slipping you our mail .
come on out here , you badgirl .
sean , she doesn 't belong here .
let hergo .
she wouldn't be here ... if it wasn't foryou , hunt .
from this moment , you are responsible for what happens to her .
and ifyou're looking out for her well being ,
lsuggestyou advise her topick up the injectiongun andbring it to me .
ball's in your court , hunt .
nyah's in the building .
do you copy?
thankyou .
how do you know he won't shoot you the minute he's got it?
please .
one can't hold nyah responsible for her actions .
you know women , mate .
like monkeys they are .
won't let go ofone branch till they get a grip on the next !
get it , nyah .
i'll coveryou .
i am waiting .
things haven't exactly worked out the way you thought they would , ethan .
sorry .
you bitch !
****** [ lndistinctsinging ]
you're not gonna shoot me , sean .
not this bitch .
'cause she's worth $$37 million .
what did you thinkyou were doing?
i wasn't thinking !
just trying to stop you from getting hurt , that's all !
you who don't have a conscience .
i guess i lied .
you can't get us both out of here , can you?
i'm infected with chimera .
you know you don't have a choice .
just do it .
do it now !
we've got 1 9 hours and 58 minutes !
i'll get bellerophon into your system before then !
just stay alive !
i'm not going to lose you !
feel like pleading foryour life?
well , then , how about dying ... so you can make me a lot of money?
in just a few hours time , you can be assured ... of going down in history as the typhoid mary of oz .
g'day .
there 's not a chance oflocating nyah until lcan access thesatellite .
and there's not a chance ofdoing that until i can get this computer fiixed .
how much time does she have left?
not long .
but whatever happens , nyah will take care of nyah .
what do you mean?
unless we dose her with bellerophon ,
nyah will kill herself .
so fii rst things fii rst .
ethan , ambrose and his team have arrived ... over the bridge , andnyah's not with him , mate .
copy that .
you all right , mate? looks like pretty hea vy security from here .
what's it looklike from there?
risky .
simon?
simon !
stay here .
breached the structure at the 1 0 : 00 grating .
it's a dna match .
the blood's loaded with chimera .
and they certainly have bellerophon .
well , then you've got both the virus and the antivirus , which means i've got 30million foryou .
not exactly .
we don't wantjust your cash .
what do you want?
stock , mr. mccloy .
stock options , to be a little more precise .
cut her loose ... right in the center oftown .
the more crowded the better .
ethan , just picked up an ambrose call .
nyah's been dropped off .
where is she?
somewhere in sydney .
somewhere in sydney?
care to harden the target?
i can't until ...
i can get the gps up on our computer .
it's down .
the clock is ticking .
how quickly can you manufacture more ofthe antivirus?
no time at all , once i've got it .
good .
biocyte stock isjust a few weeks away from going through the roof .
what are you talking about?
an outbreak of chimera .
where?
downtown sydney , for a start .
you create the supply , mr. mccloy .
we'vejust created the demand .
three million people in sydney ... and 1 7 million people in australia ... are going to need bellerophon within the next few days , not to mention the rest ofthe world .
now , this is how it's going to work .
wallis , theshares outstanding are?
93 . 4 million .
which means , mr. mccloy , we need to get our hands on 480, 000 options .
we'll borrow your 30 million to buy those options .
yourstock has neversold above $3 1 a share .
when your stock goes north of 200 , which it will , those options will be worth billions , andl will own 51 % ofbiocyte .
this is outrageous .
i will not let you take control of my company .
sit down .
you'll be a billionaire .
it 's better than being broke .
i have terrorists and ... other pharmaceutical companies standing in line .
the ball's in your court , mr. mccloy .
run that bastard down .
we're running short on time , mr. mccloy .
we have got to conclude our business .
yes .
start the transfer .
follow it ... and let me know .
uh !
raise your hands very slowly .
sure you want me to do this?
raiseyour hands very slo wly .
ethan , ethan , do you copy?
do you copy?
keep it going !
sean , this rat's reached the endofthe maze .
is he alive?
yeah , more orless .
bring him to me .
go !
sean , transfer completed .
well done , stamp .
well done .
stop mumbling !
i'm afraid he's got no choice .
lbelieve lbroke hisja w .
stamp , i'm impressed .
right .
we don't have a lot oftime , hunt .
whateveryougot to say , say it now .
how about giving us a big smile?
no?
what are you doing?
get down on your knees .
now , this is what's known ... as getting your gun off .
****** [ choirsinging requiem ]
there he is !
ethan !
just back off and pinpoint your positions !
luther , clear the bridge for me !
hunt's heading for the bridge , coming in at 1 2 : 00 high .
oh , i'm mad now .
ha ha !
you all right , mate?
that punk put a hole in my versace !
ethan , the computer's up .
i've got nyah .
she's moved out ofthe city .
she's on the north head bluff approaching the cliffs .
but i can't get a visual .
copy !
she's only got a little time left !
track ahead and pick her up !
i can't get a good shot .
ethan , we won't be able to coveryou !
my earpiece is fa iling !
you've got me on gps !
bring her to me !
billy , north head bluff .
haul ass .
get out there and keep fii ring !
i can't see anything !
slow down , mate !
slow down !
range is 2k .
ahhh !
go ahead .
use it , hunt .
it 's not a bad way togo .
it's a lot better than the way that bitch is gonna die .
****** [ lndistinctsinging ]
hey , there she is !
****** [ woman vocalizing ]
hunt !
youshould've killed me .
miss hall's blood , it appears , has absolutely no elements ofthe chimera virus , not even antibodies .
yes .
i gathered as much .
but you were under specifii c instructions , mr. hunt , to bring back a living sample ofthe chimera virus .
i'd be very interested to know how , afteryou managed this recovery , it subsequently got destroyed .
by fii re .
it's the best way , really .
oh .
well , mr. hunt , as for miss hall , in light of her efforts , her criminal record will certainly be expunged .
wiped out .
i'm assuming you approve .
i do .
yeah .
where is she now , by the way?
any idea?
i don't know .
not exactly .
so , what areyourplans?
uh , somesort ofvacation .
i'll letyou know where i'm going .
you don't have to do that .
it wouldn 't be a vacation ifyou did .
