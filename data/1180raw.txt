bags , shush .
bags , shh ! i can try tojustify but i still need you here with me  in my heart , i had hope
answers still are left behind [ continues indistinctly ]
wow .
yeah .
and that was it .
a month later , we moved in together .
and why the hell did we get married ... when we had loving each other so completely nailed?
i don't know .
ten seconds .
well , why does anyone get married?
does it make sense to be with one person ... for your entire life?
people change .
they grow .
you're on , tom .
maybe we'd still be together ... if i'd gotten the proposal right ... but nope ...
the proposal is critical , and i blew it .
tom !
this is tom leezak ... with knr traffic at 2 : 06 a . m .
at this hour , there are approximately seven vehicles ... on all southland freeways .
so if you feel like skateboarding down the 405 ... she's wide open .
stay tuned for another traffic update in 10 minutes ... on knr , your traffic information station .
and we're out .
look here , tom .
you gotta focus .
all right , man?
forget about proposals .
forget about marriage .
all right?
bags .
do you have to grunt all the time?
you're just like ... a little pig with hair .
would you ...
oh , look at me .
i'm just the cutest doggy in the wo world .
i'm the cutest doggy in the world .
throw the ball for me .
i'll pull on your leg all day .

it wasn't like bags to chase pigeons .
this pigeon was cruel .
it was ...
bags , he just ...
whoo , he just went for him .
he was taunting .
and ... squawking .
squawking?
oh ... squawking .
at first , it was ...
it was more of a a , more of a purring .
coo .
you know how they coo .
yeah .
you know , i mean , bags was ...
you know , got his attention .
he has a low tolerance ... for those kinds of annoyances .
but then it turned into this , like , shrill ... c caw ...

aiikkaa ... aiiaaa , aiikk , aiikk , aiikk ... aaiiaaa .

i ...
i just hope that i can be ... all that i can be ... in this ... family .
well ...
i love sarah .
that's all i need to know .
well , you really missed the boat ... didn't you , prentiss?
yes , i did , dan .
you bet your ass you did .
i should've been courting sarah ... instead of putting in 19 hour days at the office .
anyway ... congratulations , to both of you .
seriously , from ... from my heart .
thank you , peter .
you're a lucky man .
hey , i know that .
grab a flute ofbubbly and rise .
everybody ready?
why is peter prentiss here?
dad's doing a business deal with him .
all right .
health , wealth , happiness !
health , wealth , happiness !
all right .
peewee , 10 yard out .
leezak , gimme a five yard slant .
you got this , man .
don't worry about it .
calm down .
what do you mean , calm down?
hey , why do bad things happen to good people?
that's what i want to know .
where's that in your book?
she's very determined , you know .
are you kidding?
look , he's a polack .
no , he's a ...
he's a polack .
i know that .
i warned you .
let's see what leezak's packing .
ready?
all right .
and break !
break !
on one .
ready?
break !
you girls ready for this?
down !
set !
unh !
oh .
gee .
that was a hard one .
that was a tough one .
yeah !
that's what i'm talkin 'about .
what are you doing , willie?
hey , i slipped .
i still got my flag .
i'm good .
i'm good .
oh , my peewee .
always moving so fast .
you move in together after a month ...
live together for nine months , and now you're engaged .
oh , i know you love him , but you know ... sometimes it takes more than love ... to sustain a marriage .
you need to be old enough to know who you are ... and what you want and who he is .
oh , mom , mom , he's wild and spontaneous ... and hysterical and offbeat ... and on top of all that ... he's centered , and he's down to earth .
he's everything i want ... and we have this passion for each other ... that's just ... oh !
i'm jealous .
ha ha ha !
all right .
first thing tomorrow ... we're gonna plan this wedding !
hey , you .
so i guess everyone thinks that we're crazy ... for doing this .
now , when did we start caring about what other people think?
well , are you sure that ... you don't want to marry a guy like peter?
if i wanted to know exactly what my life would be ... from here on out ...
i would marry a guy like peter .
but i love not knowing .
i love our messy loft .
your beater car .
ha ha .
i want to start a life with you .
sarah?
go .
hi , daddy .
peewee ... marriage is like a business investment .
its ...
its long term viability ... is best established unemotionally .
bottom line , daddy?
we love each other .
that is all that matters , tsk .
leezak .
good night , sir .
congratulations , mr. leezak .
big daddy leezak's in the house . !
oh , i hope she doesn't spook on you , man .
what do you mean?
i love sarah .
don't get me wrong , but ... rich chicks spook .
a powerful daddy plus family money ... equals expectations .
expectations are like a fungal rot on a marriage .
my marriage is not gonna have a fungal rot .
we're gonna be happily married every day ... for the rest of our lives .
unless she finds out that you slaughtered her dog .
oh , don't worry .
i'll take that to my grave .
okay .
if you change your mind at the altar ... just pass out .
i'm not going to change my mind .
okay .
i'm just saying if you do ... just hit the floor .
thank you , but it's not gonna happen .
so , you're sure you're ready ... to give up your grazing rights?
i'm not a grazer , kyle .
well , what if you became one later in life?
i mean , over the next 10 years ... you're giving up five hayrides per year .
so i can either be happily married to sarah ... or have 50 one night stands .
minimum .
that's not even a choice .
okay , okay .
let's move on .
are there any chicks you didn't have ... that you wish you had?
you are , like , the worst best man ever .
hey , peter . !
over here , prentiss .
i can't believe she invited prentiss .
glad you made it , buddy .
hey , man .
what's going on?
did she ever hook up with that yahoo?
they went backpacking in europe once .
it was after high school .
i don't think anything happened .
whoa .
you're getting married ... and she didn't share the roster?
she shared the roster .
merrick and bruce .
what about prentiss?
and you never asked again?
i won .
it's irrelevant .
oh .
okay .
as long as you're okay with a bogus roster .
it's not a bogus roster .
is he on , or is he off?
he's ...
shut up .
huh?
huh?
and you could've had peter .
i did have peter .
it wasn't that hot , okay?
excuse me?
i was in seattle ... helping on an appraisal ... ran into peter ...
we went out .
i drank way too much ... and before i knew it we ... tussled .
you bad girl .
i wanted to tell tom so many times ... but he gets so jealous , you know?
listen , it doesn't matter that he doesn't know .
it's not like you guys were married ... and even if you were ...
no , no , no .
it matters to me .
it's like living a lie .
i cannot live a lie .
there will always be this big , fat elephant ... in the room with us .
listen , peewee .
never tell him .
it's time to go , sarah .
come on .
got everything?
yes .
how you holding up?
pussy's a mess .
i'm just telling you right now .
be prepared . [ organ plays " here comes the bride " ]
wait .
okay .
oh !
ow .
ooh .

yes .

i'm fine .
this threshold thing isn't as easy as it looks .
daddy got the big suite !
yeah , he did .
we're really married .
we're really , really really married .
forever and ever .
do you feel like ... it?
i don't know .
do you?
oh ...
i'm kind of tired .
me too .
i am .
i mean , yeah .
okay .
what's the matter?
it's our wedding night , and we don't want to have sex .
no .
uh ... it's okay .
we're tired .
it's fine .
it's just that this is our wedding day ... and it's something i fantasized about ... my whole life . [ organ plays " wedding march " ]
and now it's over .
did you have wedding fantasies ... when you were a little boy?
kinda .
oh , honey .
oh , my god .
tomorrow , my parents are gonna know ...
i'm not a virgin anymore .
sarah ... whoa .
you haven't been a virgin since college .
i know .
i know ... but tomorrow they're gonna know for sure ... that i'm not a virgin ... and they're gonna know that you deflowered me .
oh , god !
oh , no !
oh , honey !
deflowered?
that's what my mom always called it .
my mommy .
oh , sarah .
whoa , whoa , whoa .
hey .

i wonder what kind of wheels we got?
i'm telling you .
this is not the car .

thank you very much , ma'am .

ooh !
whoa , whoa !
turn here !
you okay?
yeah , you?
yeah .
if you would've told me about the turn ... maybe before we passed it ...
i wouldn't have had to pull such a nascar evasive maneuver .
i was busy looking at the map .
somebody had to navigate .
listen to us .
we sound like an old married couple .
never again .
just for the record ... why did i almost get us killed back there?
because that's our hotel .
it looks like a castle .
it is a castle .
and that's precisely why it looks like one .
mmm .

'cause we're paying out the ass for it .
honey , just for the record ... when you talk about money ... especially in reference to it coming out of your heinie ... it sort of kills the romance of the moment .

hey .
do you guys , uh , provide satellite tv?
tv in bar .
so there's no tv in this room?

i'll try to be a little bit more refined ...

fredo ...
i need to know where that little signora is ... at all times .
very bold , mr. prentiss .
grazie .
dodgers won . !
dodgers won . !
the dodgers won , honey .
see ...
i knew you were going to make me pay ... for watching the game .
no .
no , it's not that .
we need to talk .
about what?
have you always told me the truth?
yeah .
except the time i told you ...
i liked your brother willie .
this is serious .
i am serious .
i really don't like him .
marriage is built on honesty and trust .
i totally agree .
okay .
then did you ever do something ... that you wanted to tell me about ... but you couldn't because you felt bad about it?
and the more time went on ... the harder it got for you to tell me?
and then it turned into this big , fat lie ... so you kept not telling me about it ...
did you talk to kyle?
no .
why?
no reason .
does kyle know something that i should know?
no .
you covered your nose .
i had an itch .
you were hiding flared nostrils .
what do you have to tell?
okay .
it's just ... when bags died ... he didn't exactly die ... the way that i described it .
him chasing those squawking pigeons off the balcony?
yeah , that .
what happened?
well ...
okay .
i'm reading my magazine ... and i'm really ...
i'm focusing ... and i'm really into it ... and along comes bags , you know?
he comes trucking over ... and he starts tugging on my ankle .
and i was like , " bags . !
i'm ...
i'm ...
i was like ...
i think i even said , " i'm trying to focus .
like , don't ...
and he looked up at me ... and he was giving me the look like ...
hey , are you gonna play with me or not?
and i was like ...
i reallyjust want to read though , bags .
and ...
i'm ... and ... he started pulling on my ankle again .
so , i grabbed the ball ... and i was like , " go get it , buddy .
and i threw the ball over my shoulder ... and it went out the window ... and bags dove , and he died .
you killed bags?
it was an accident .
and you lied about it all this time?
actually , it was more of an omission .
no , it was more like a lie !
where are you going?
i have to figure out what to do with this .
what does that mean?
i can deal with you being cheap ... and i can deal with you being a shitty driver .
i cannot not deal with you being a liar !
whoa .
wait a second .
this whole thing started ... with you wanting to talk about something .
well , i don't want to talk about it right now .
so you're feeling guilty about something too .
yes , there is something i " omitted " that i don't want to talk about right now .
you want a marriage based on trust and honesty?
well , here's your chance .
come on !
yeah , yeah , you got it . !
i can see it . !
bring it !
i slept with peter prentiss .
what?
i slept with peter ...
i heard you . !
i'm sorry .
i need to hear everything .
no , you don't .
yes , i do .
that's what i do .
that's what i do .
i need to know everything .
where you were , what he did ... how small his wiener was .
everything . !
i was helping on an appraisal in seattle .
i don't want to hear it !
you slept with that ...
it was a long time ago .
when?
before we ...
got married?
yes !
got engaged?
of course !
got together?
yes .
no .
no .
it was right after we met .
my parents were pressuring me to .
aha ...
imagine my surprise .
i was confused .
i'm in seattle .
he asked me out to dinner .
the champagne is flowing ...
please try not to break into song .
my feelings for you ... were very , very strong ... and i needed to know that they were real .
i wasn't brought up ... to manage feelings like that very well .
yeah ... you had a real tough upbringing .
i need some air .
yeah?
me too !
happy now?
you broke it !
oh , by the way ...
peter's staying at the hotel .

good guess .
where's tom?
we don't feel the need ... to be with each other all the time .

are you okay?
peter , just go .

sarah .
sarah .

a good husband knows ... where his wife is at all time .
and a good matre d 'answers questions when he's asked .
look , i'm not gonna pay you for an answer .
in this case , you should .
your wife is in a car ... on her way to salviati's ... with mr. prentiss .
mr. peter prentiss?
hmm?
oh .
of course .
what's salviati's?
one of the oldest ... and most beautiful estates in venice .
maybe mr. peter will buy it .
of course mr. peter will buy it .
all right .
where is this place?
hmm?
you can't go .
you will be shot on sight .
okay , that's ...
uh ...

i can't make out a word .
i want to say that , but i ...

sarah .
maybe we should switch to water , huh?
i think we should go find tom now .
that was the longest freakin 'piss in italian history .
hey .
wendy , uh ...
i couldn't find you in the crowd .
that's cool .
are you ready to go?
uh ... yeah .
listen , um ... why don't i just , uh ... walk you back to your hotel ... and drop you off?

okay .
um ... what hotel are you staying at?
what hotel are you staying at?
uh , the gianna .
oh , my god !

you were just doing the same thing with wendy .
you have no right to be angry .
you slut !
excuse me?
you had your tongue down his throat .
i saw it out the window !
did you see me slap him , then?
oh , don't give me that .
some part of you wants him .
just say it !
fine .
i'm not gonna lie anymore .
certain things would be easier given his background ... and a small part of me thought ... that i wanted that once ...
a very small part .
why would you invite him on our honeymoon?
i didn't invite him .
i don't know how he found us .
oh , yeah?
oh , well , maybe it was magic .
no , peter must be a warlock .
that's yours .
yeah , sure .
it matches perfect with my red leather panties !
okay .
i met a woman at a bar .
nothing happened .
you picked up a total stranger at a bar ... brought her back to our honeymoon suite ... and took off her disgusting red bra .
nothing happened .
i swear .
no , no , no .
the bra just jumped off her bare naked breasts .
no , no , no .
the bra just jumped off her bare naked breasts .
sarah ...
you sit there and make me feel guilty for a kiss ...
a kiss that i didn't even want in the first place .
don't tell me you didn't want it .
you wanted it !
i could see from the balcony ... that you wanted it . !
i'm sorry !
oh , my god !
son of a beeyatch !
oh !
my skull is on fire !
oh !
okay !

last chance .
come with me to seattle .

welcome to the honeymoon from hell , shitheel !
what are you doing , tom?
i think it's time for peter and i to tangle !
see !
you have no future with this lunatic !
shut up , peter !
tom , you're acting like a crazy person .
maybe it's 'cause i just got hit in the head ... with a 10 pound ashtray !
i gotta warn you , leezak .
i studied karate with a chinese grand master .
yeah?
well , i hope he showed you ... how to pull a fire poker outta your ass !
tom , put the poker down .
fredo , call the police !
polizia . !
polizia . !

run , you coward !
get him !
you stay away from my wife !
wait .
wait .
stop .
that's my husband .
please .
maybe they were right .
who?
everyone .
they said that we were too young ... and that we needed to get to know each other better .
maybe they were right .
maybe love isn't enough .
what'd he say?
peter just bailed us out .
that's ...
that's just jim dandy .
forget it .
i'm going home .
yeah , me too !
passports , please .
are you leaving with any fruit , vegetables ... or any currency in excess of $10, 000?

i just don't know if love is enough anymore .
what do you mean , " enough "?
i mean ... even if sarah and i do love each other ... maybe we did need more time to get to know each other .
so ...
what you're saying here is ... you had a couple of bad days in europe ... and ... it's over .
time to grow up , tommy .
some days your mother and me loved each other .
other days we had to work at it .
you never see the hard days in a photo album ... but those are the ones ... that get you from one happy snapshot to the next .
i'm sorry your honeymoon stunk ... but that's what you got dealt .
now you gotta work through it .
sarah doesn't need a guy with a fat wallet ... to make her happy .
i saw how you love this girl .
how you two lit each other up .
she doesn't need any more security than that .
thanks , dad .
