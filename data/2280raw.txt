the battle between heaven and hell has waged eternal , their armies fueled by souls harvested on earth .
the devil , malebolgia , has sent a lieutenant to earth ... to recruit men to turn the world into a place of death ... in exchange for wealth and power a place that provides enough souls to complete his army ... and allow armageddon to begin .
all the dark lord needs now is a great soldier , someone who can lead his hordes to the gates of heaven ... and burn them down .
like him , i killed in the name of good , but the violence of my life ... pulled my soul towards the darkness .
but i fought and freed my soul .
now i watch for others like me .
men are the ones who create evil on earth .
it is the choices they make ... that enslave their souls to hell .
this is the test .
the leader of the algerian revolutionary front ... was killed yesterday along with 26 innocent civilians ... in a vicious rocket attack in hong kong .
there has been an outpouring of anti u. s. sentiment ... sweeping across the globe .
protesters in libya , bosnia , france , moscow ... and the united states ... are denouncing ...
simmons is the best .
simmons is not the problem !
he's overseas killing the bad guys ...
iike the hero he thinks he is .
we made a deal , wynn .
where the hell ... is the ultimate weapon you promised?
this isn't a game we're playing .
engineering a biological weapon is an exact science .
you want it done right , you do it my way .
this five year plan of yours just chaps my buttocks .
i'm making you a guarantee .
just keep certain agencies off my back ... and make damn sure i get all that i've been promised .
if i say you're the man , you're the man .
you do for me , in no time you'll be running this place .
when the big pinata breaks , you'll get it all .
just make sure you keep your end of the bargain .
p. s ...
there's one more item on our " to do " list .
it requires your personal attention .
we need you to help recruit a very special soldier for us .
your all time favorite killer , ai simmons .
simmons?
he's doing a great job where he is .
why do you want him?
why do you people always question?
why ask " why? " when " how? " is so much more fun?
oh ... not again .
wanda , do me a favor .
yeah?
buy your man a watch .
he's on his way out .
do me a favor .
what's that?
make sure he's back for dinner tomorrow night .
i'll do my best .
make sure he's back for dinner , terry .
yes , ma'am .
hey , spaz .
same routine , all right?
guard the house .
guard wanda .
great guard dog .
here .
al , what happened last night?
look at this .
what a friggin 'mess .
we were supposed to take out bad guys , not innocent bystanders .
another jason wynn special .
what do you mean?
an awful lot of wynn's ops have screwed the pooch lately .
don't worry , al .
lighten up .
i got your back .
semper fi .
good to go .
all right .
i'm going to keep my eye on wynn .
vehicle secure .
the airport kill zone ... was supposed to be clear of civilians .
an unfortunate but necessary sacrifice .
you want someone filling body bags , send priest .
if you can't handle it , i will .
i will send whoever wherever i choose .
you will follow orders and do your job .
got a problem with that , soldier?
yes , i do , sir ... and i want out .
i always knew you'd lose your nerve .
you don't quit us , son .
we are not the u. s. postal service .
have you read your profile recently?
you are a borderline psychopath , perfect for government service .
no guilt , no fear .
you're a killing machine .
you're wrong about me , wynn .
am l?
have you stopped to consider ... that you won't be happy doing anything else?
i made up my mind .
nothing i can say to change it?
nothing .
i'll arrange for your transfer ... right after we've run this last operation .
north korean refinery secretly producing biological weapons .
it's up to us to take out the plant ... and carefully destroy all the biochemical viruses .
come on , son .
this is top priority .
let's get it over with .
what the hell is going on here?
priorities have changed , al .
there's a town nearby .
if you release the virus , they'll all die .
a town with approximately 8, 000 experimental hosts .
are you out of your damn mind?
i'm not going to let you do this .
looks like i'm up for a promotion .
you wipe his ass , too?
you son of a bitch .
you knew what was going on all along .
i do believe he's catching on .
enjoy your retirement , old friend .
oh , and by the way , don't worry about wanda .
i'll take good care of her .
you touch her , and you're a dead man .
you're the dead man .
see you in hell , al .
aw , look who was left in the oven too long .
i told him well done , not burnt .
i'm gonna have fun with you .
hey , mister , you don't look so good .
hey , mister , you thirsty?
get the get lost , kid .
what are you looking at , old man?
you tell me .
you've been gone a long time , friend .
what are you talking about?
where am l?
rat city .
part of the alley .
i sleep over there .
this is a holy place .
all are welcome here .
here , zack , here .
yeah , right .
don't loiter !
let's go !
let's go !
you're welcome to join us ... if you choose .
i got a home .
a new hellspawn has emerged from the darkness .
reborn on earth ... drawn to the alley by an unknown force ... his necroplasmic body wracked by pain ... his memories fragmented .
to him , north korea was moments ago .
malebolgia kept him secluded in darkness five long years ... while things on earth changed in ways ... that will only feed his anger and desire for revenge .
he sets out to reclaim his humanity .
how much is left remains to be seen .
one ... two ... three !
i don't have a choice .
i'll always love you ... forever .
spaz .
kids , i got more tricks than your local hooker .
here you go .
they say it's a trick , but it's snot .
little girl , where are you going?
want some candy?
cyan !
you ok , baby?
terry !
i like children ... fried .
what's going on?
this man was lying next to cyan .
are you ok , honey?
what are you doing back here , huh?
what is it?
beat it before i call the cops .
come on , get out of here .
there you are .
i've been looking everywhere for you .
bad crispy !
bad crispy !
clown not like .
sorry for the turbulence , folks .
he's harmless .
just a freak accident with some jiffy pop .
just get out of here and take him .
oh , what an adorable little girl .
can i keep her?
hey .
of course not .
no pets allowed .
a little something for lolita here?
baby exorcist .
come on , my barbecued friend .
don't want to keep ... that side order of potato salad waiting .
he knew my name .
are you sure?
come on .
let's get the kids inside .
you can't get married .
wanda's the best thing that ever happened to me .
i'm there for you , buddy .
this is my last mission .
wait for me .
i just don't want to lose you , baby .
you will never lose me .
i promise .
the master and i are going to have words .
he knows i hate clowns .
god , i hate them .
i hate them all .
i hate bozo , ronald , chuckles ... with their freakin 'dumb noses and their lousy party hats !
i don't mind being short , fat , and ugly , but the pay sucks !
easy with that face .
i'm eating .
what does this remind you of?
no , naughty boy .
oops .
a wet one .
i hope i didn't stain my underwear .
look at that .
skid marks .
get away from me , you freak .
coming from a monster , that really hurts my feelings .
come back here , scrotum face .
i'm not done with you yet .
feels like my skin is about to explode .
that's your viral necroplasm going through its larval stage .
move over .
pretty soon you'll get hair in funny places , and you'll start thinking about girls .
getting a chubby , studly?
a half guy , semi?
just get me to a hospital .
a hospital?
have you looked in a mirror , burnt man walking?
even the entire cast of " er " couldn't put you together again .
how do i put this to you?
you're pushing up daisies .
you're in permanent nap time .
you're fertilizer .
is any of this sinking in?
you're dead .
d e d .
dead .
i guess five years feeding earthworms ... has eaten what little brain there was in there .
what are you?
allow me to kick start your memory .
hang on .
these flashbacks can be killers .
you're the dead man .
see you in hell , al .
this is the bargain .
if you lead my army , you can see wanda again .
what is your answer?
i will lead your army !
anything for wanda !
if you fail me , you will die .
avenge your murder .
kill jason wynn .
malebolgia spent five years preparing the earth ... for your arrival , mister .
a little death , a little destruction ... perfect marriage .
speaking of marriage ... guess who's not your fiancee anymore .
and the winners are wanda and terry .
multiplying like rabbits .
and humpin 'and porkin '... and doin 'it and likin 'it .
you stay away from her .
i don't want wanda .
i want you to take care of wynn .
then you and the army can kick some angelic buttocks .
and in return for your services , we'll get wanda back for you .
you could have every wanda on the planet .
why settle for leftovers?
i love this guy .
you kill me .
go ahead , stud .
this is all some sadistic game of wynn's .
and when i catch him ... he'll wish he had killed me when he had the chance .
that's it !
that's the spirit .
just think of me as your guardian angel .
the clown from hell .
you're jimmy stewart , and i'm clarence .
uh , well , well , every time somebody farts ,
a demon gets his wings .
oops , twins .
get away from me , you fudge packing midget !
you still don't get it , do you , amnesia boy?
we'll have to dig a little deeper .
what is this?
this is where old folks go after florida , son .
what is that you say?
can i dig up my body now?
why , certainly .
of course you can .
if you strike oil , half of it is mine .
start digging .
hail , satan , lord of all that we can see .
in the name of luther , bialy , and levinson ,
i command thee to appear !
told you we need a bigger pentagram .
how about we get back to that sacrifice a virgin idea?
i like that !
you know what i need here , man?
a fresh skull , man !
yeah , you .
get away !
fresh !
every time you go out there , you come back a little bit more dead inside .
oh , come on .
you scream like a girl .
do it like this .
someone's a little angry 'cause they died and went to
hello , my mutant , hello , my carcass , hello , my bug infested corpse .
did , like , satan send you guys?
god hogs up all the good followers , and we get all the retards .
what's up with that face?
get your hands off me !
help .
what is that?
shocked and amazed at the wonders of necroflesh?
you're not alone .
for a limited time only , you , too , can have this handsome epidermis ... for the eensy price of your soul and a buttload of pain .
let's get out of here !
oh , my god !
i hate weekend satanists , don't you?
look at you .
from spawn larva to full fledged hellspawn in record time .
what ... is this?
you were tied to the tracks , and that stupid train just kept running over you , didn't it?
running over you .
in the name of the people and things of hell ,
i dub thee ...
spawn , general of hell's army .
arise , your crispness !
arise , duke of deep fried !
sultan of sizzling !
emir of ooey gooey !
so i suck as a clown .
bite me .
do your job , i'll be the first to kiss your black butt , but if you can't hack it ,
i'll fed ex your worthless carcass ... back to the frying pan , where malebolgia will be waiting for us .
you'll wake up the dead .
that's you .
dead people can still die .
all i got to do is cut off your head .
oh , god .
did you have to use the " g " word?
wanda ...
what have i done?
you done with this hallmark moment?
i can't take any more of this sentimental crap .
come on .
i'll come back when your armor hardens .
don't play with it .
you'll go blind .
i have a few more details to attend to , and then we can play .
yuck !
i hate anchovies .
that tastes so good , i could kick some puppies !
this freak stuff will come in handy ... when i get my hands on wynn .
you're letting them get to you .
easy , friend .
every choice has its consequences .
who are you?
an assassin ... like you .
i killed for the kingdom of saxony 500 years ago .
i am cogliostro .
that's all you need to know ... for now .
are there any normal people left on earth?
or is everyone just back from hell?
how do you address the accusations from some ... that the cla only acts to protect ... the government's economic interests ... in the regions of conflict?
i think the government has been attentive ... to the sensitivities of the nations involved .
since the unfortunate incident in southeast asia last week ,
director wynn has been meeting with several world leaders ... in an attempt to quell the proliferation ... of global conflicts .
has this produced results?
last week's peace summit between arabs and lsraelis ... was disrupted by bomb threats from the christian coalition .
fitzgerald may be a spineless bureaucrat , but he's doing a great p. r. job for me .
the world is going to hell in a handbasket .
thanks to him , it's just another story on the 5 : 00 news .
like lambs to the slaughter .
the best is yet to come .
there it is , jess .
finally ready .
heat 16 .
makes the ebola virus look like a skin rash .
that north korean biochemical operation really paid off .
we harvested the ultimate weapon from those diseased bodies , and now we have the only vaccine .
was there ever any doubt?
never .
we have weapons in place to disperse heat 16 ... over half of this godforsaken globe .
soon the whole world will be at my command .
anyone who refuses to join my consortium ... won't be around to argue .
time to get reacquainted , jason .
director wynn , terry fitzgerald is here .
send him in .
speak of the devil .
come in .
good to see you .
director , the car is waiting downstairs .
good .
you know agent priest .
yes .
could i have a word with you ... alone?
of course .
would you excuse us?
glad you dropped by , son .
i want to commend you on your handling of the media .
those rumors about me were becoming a real headache .
let's have a drink .
thank you .
i know we've been covering up problems ... with our missions overseas .
i really can't keep lying like this , sir .
lying?
really?
i'd like to put a team together , analyze the field op data , get to the bottom of it .
but you're not an analyst anymore .
there's no reason not to take a look , sir .
on the contrary .
beg your pardon?
tell me ... how are cyan and wanda?
little girl just had a birthday , didn't she?
they're both fine .
i'm glad to hear that .
now , let's get something straight .
i run this organization the way i see fit , and i will do whatever is necessary to keep it that way .
your job is to make damn sure the public agrees with me .
that clear enough?
good .
the car is waiting .
achmed and abdullah .
achmed , my friend .
good to see you .
abdullah , good to see you .
up .
this one here .
excuse us .
excuse me , sir .
urgent call .
gentlemen ...
have you made a decision?
your heat 16 test was very impressive .
how do you control delivery of the weapon?
it's the latest in nanotechnology .
let me assure you , the weapon is problem free .
we've already placed orders with several of our allies .
you're becoming quite a powerful man .
your consortium will soon rival the united nations .
not at all , sir .
i'm just a facilitator .
thank you .
my partners are the beneficiaries .
to my partners , gentlemen .
code red security breach , sir .
where?
at the armory .
a detail's en route .
i'm on my way .
damn it .
agent priest has arrived .
wait here .
there's been a break in at a 6 , the armory .
who?
we don't know .
there's a security detail downstairs with priest .
let's get out of here .
you !
who are you?
what's the matter , jason?
you don't recognize your own handiwork?
you left me to die in that biochem plant , remember?
simmons !
you sent me to hell !
i'm here to return the favor !
i trusted you .
jesus .
how could you marry wanda?
how could you?
al , when you died ...
wanda was devastated .
do you know about cyan?
time to die , jason .
nice outfit , asshole .
damn .
what the hell is that?
it's simmons !
what are you talking about?
that thing is simmons !
i want you to nail him now !
it's a little early for halloween .
where you're going , every day's halloween .
you don't have the guts .
you're right .
coming , coming .
will that be the same or separate checks , lady?
just when i was getting sick of you whining about wanda , you do us proud .
so congrats on your first mission .
go ahead .
run !
holy shit !
shoot on sight .
i say again shoot on sight .
get a light on him !
there !
you see him?
no , sir !
where the hell did he go?
negative , sir !
there he is !
all right !
take him !
what have we got here?
gunshot wound to the head , doc .
oh , she's dead .
come on .
easy .
make some room here .
put her around the back .
why didn't you warn me about simmons?
spawn was ready sooner than i expected , so don't get your panties in a wad .
always bitching at me
why didn't you tell me about simmons?
why didn't you tell me it was going to hurt?
am i going to go to hell?
oh , grow up , you syphilitic ball sac .
at least you had fun compared to them .
fun?
does this look like playland to you?
he killed priest !
he damn near killed me !
you say that like it's a bad thing .
no , jerky .
jerky , spawn's a big idiot .
look , he's been through hell .
as soon as he finishes one more little detail , he'll be ready to join us .
i've done my part .
how about yours?
how we doing on your front?
heat 16 is ready to go .
it better be .
the army's ready .
the spawn's ready .
the heat 16 completes the picture .
congrat a freak a lations .
what's simmons got to do with all this?
he's just the highest scoring killer of all time .
if we hadn't recruited him , the other side would have .
i almost forgot again .
memo from brimstone breath we're going to rig a fancy schmancy device ... that connects your heartbeat to the heat 16 bomb , so if your heart stops ticking , the bomb goes off .
we don't want any smart ass fruitcake ... taking you out ahead of schedule .
an insurance policy from hell , the good hands people .
that's a good idea .
i like that .
i want your special attention dealing with spawn , you hear me?
gladly .
good .
now , stay sharp .
the night is young .
ladies?
ooh , clownie .
ah , yes .
have you ever ridden a clown's pink pony?
i think it's about time .
when all the world is mine ,
i will personally fry your lard ass .
as you've seen , the terrible north korean biochemical disaster ... unleashed a whole host of new diseases .
ten thousand people died in the first month ... after the disaster five years ago .
millions have contracted these fatal diseases diphtheria , cholera , smallpox diseases that had been virtually wiped out .
thought i was getting rid of the world's vermin , and i turn out to be one of them .
the number of sick and dying children continues to grow .
it's up to us to put an end ... to the suffering of these innocent children .
spaz !
what happened to you?
i was playing with spaz , and i fell down .
are you all right?
yeah , i'm ok .
wow .
your face is weird .
cool .
what's your name?
spawn .
i'm cyan .
you have your mother's eyes .
i knew her a long time ago .
let's get you back to your mother .
my , my , my .
what a pretty little dress .
i wonder if she's got it in my size?
spawnie , spawnie , he's our man .
if he can't kill 'em , no one can .
yay , spawnie !
s " to the " p " to the " a " to the " awn .
go , spawnie , go , spawnie !
you fool !
i put you on earth ... to make sure spawn keeps his end of the bargain .
why'd you pick him to lead the army anyway?
what are you thinking?
it should be me .
i had the tenure .
it's not fair !
it's not fair !
and that's exactly the kind of talk ... we don't tolerate around here , right , boss?
enough !
spawn must choose ... to murder wynn and release the virus .
then my army will be complete .
now , now , boss ...
this is your last chance .
thank you .
excuse me .
cyan !
honey , didn't i tell you not to leave my sight?
i was playing with spaz , and i fell down , and spawn came and helped me .
you're not supposed to talk to strangers , either .
spawn's not a stranger , mommy .
we're going home right now .
what's going on?
what is going on?
i'll explain later .
no , explain now .
i'm not going through this again .
no secrets .
wynn was attacked at the reception .
i don't want to take any chances .
trust me .
go home .
fix your seat belt , honey .
what the hell is going on?
daddy , what about spaz?
spaz?
go home , spaz .
he knows the way back home better than we do .
let's go , terry .
you don't want to be where i'm going .
but it's your funeral .
hey , what the hell are you doing?
puking up decent food , boy?
it's rotten .
you think we eat so good you can just spit up what you like?
don't talk back to me .
eat this !
no , don't !
he's my dad .
keep away from him .
b. p. and heart rate?
one thirty four over 77 , heart rate , 60 .
let's increase the flow to 3 . 5 .
we're ready for the monitor .
i'll make a small incision ... so that we can insert this heart monitor .
you'll feel a slight pinch .
awesome hardware .
what will you do with it?
throw someone a going away party .
need any help?
listen , kid ...
i'm not looking to make friends .
what's your name?
zack .
i'm al .
that's spaz .
breathe normally , director .
the system is now operational .
as per your orders , director wynn , if your vital signs flatline for any reason , the device will uplink and detonate the heat 16 bombs .
no one would dare kill you .
good work , doc .
what a double cross .
i got wynn to kill spawn and create the heat 16 bomb .
now i get spawn to murder wynn and release the virus .
if all goes well , it should hurt like hell .
i can't believe i actually got wynn to get operated .
what a maroon .
it's going to send earth into a tailspin ... of death and destruction .
it's time .
sometimes i wake up at night down in the alley and wonder ...
is this hell?
not yet ... but soon .
heads up .
got one .
who's your new friend , spawn?
get out of here , zack .
but
go !
miss me?
here's clownie !
it was you who told wynn to kill me .
guilty as charged .
before i blow your fat circus ass away , tell me why you picked me to lead your war .
if it isn't curious crispy .
the evil's been there ... since you were soup in your mama's crotch .
your dna spelled doa , and we just nursed it along .
those assassin missions were just training for what's coming .
let's get down to business .
wynn's finally got that heat 16 virus bomb working .
made especially for you .
get things started with a big , wet , infectious ...
all you have to do is just lead us to the holy land , so we can burn it down .
you filthy little piece of vermin .
what makes you think i would join your army?
you can take your army and shove it .
sounds like a country song " take your army and shove it .
you've got that " i want to beat the fat little man " ...
iook in your eye .
i'm going to cut you into 50 pieces ... and mail you to every state .
i'll take your intestines and
i don't know how you put up with this crap .
you're a bigger fool than i thought ... if you think you're going to wreck my plans .
you'll do what you promised .
put down my dog .
nice doggie .
heel , fetch ...
no , i got it .
play dead !
you want to do it the hard way?
i warned you .
i'll just have to teach you a lesson .
no more clowning around .
i'm not the vindicator ... or the victimizer ... or the vaporizer or the vibrator .
i'm ... the violator !
good lord !
i ain't staying !
damn alley ain't safe no more !
we're going .
violator , one , spawnie boy , zero .
you've been violated , girlie man , huh?
i could have killed you like that .
is that a little more surprise than you wanted?
twinkle , twinkle , little spawn .
you look like crap .
go fertilize my lawn .
you're not excited yet?
helter skelter's coming down with or without you .
either you lead the army , or wynn plays pin the tail on wanda .
hey , wanda , come on , give me that sweet stuff .
oh , no .
oh , please , wynn , don't .
somebody help me .
forget terry .
it's my turn to ride the wanda carousel of love .
stay away from her .
your choice .
see you at wanda's .
last one there gets her rotten eggs .
wynn and wanda sitting in a tree , s u c k i n g .
first comes love ...
the truth has taken its toll on you .
i'm going to kill that asshole .
you still haven't learned .
clearance granted .
downloading secure files .
gotcha , jason .
i can't afford to be wrong .
still with us , i see .
your vengeance ... their pain .
wynn , wanda none of this is worth the cost .
those are the only things that matter to me now .
ai simmons is dead .
let him go .
i am simmons , old man .
you're spawn now , but that doesn't mean you have to be what they want .
you're still letting them get to you .
your anger is your weakness .
they'll use it to rob you of any humanity you have left .
ai simmons knew that violence ... only makes for more pain and suffering .
he tried to leave off killing , give himself a second chance .
your old life is gone .
accept that .
i still love wanda .
put her in the past .
it's the only way you can be free .
she's the only reason i'm here .
the war between heaven and hell ... depends on the choices we make , and those choices require sacrifice .
that's the test .
i didn't know this was going to happen .
i'm going to nail that scumbag .
kiss it good bye , clown .
this is just what they want .
you're playing their game .
then i'll play dirty .
guns are useless .
you got a better idea?
i might .
you've been using your armor only by reflex .
you must learn to control it .
it has trillions of neuroconnections .
they're a living extension of your own instincts , instantly translating your thought ... into physical reality , so long as you stay clear and focused .
so ... that's how it works .
cool !
now try your chains .
you must visualize your objective .
the armor does the rest .
all right , yoda .
wait .
you ready?
all right , go !
not bad .
don't get cocky .
you've a lot more to learn .
your cape has its own powers .
i have to get to wanda's .
take care of your powers .
when you drain them , you die .
won't be needing these .
you're catching on .
or this .
i want you to return spaz to me .
no matter how you find him .
understand?
now ... the final test .
get out of my way !
i'll get spawn so worked up , he'll kill wynn without blinking .
when i'm done with you , they'll change your name to " stain .
look , ma , no hands !
i love the smell ... of burning asphalt in the morning !
send a boy to do a clown's job?
it's an honor to be a hellspawn , you hear me?
that's not fair !
time for some necro goo !
open wide and say " aah !
see you at wanda's !
reading secure files .
christ .
wynn is out of his mind .
i'm thirsty .
ok , baby .
you want some water?
establishing connection .
what have you got?
black bag ops , assassination lists , everything .
wynn's been using a 6 to run a criminal consortium .
he's got some biological weapon called heat 16 .
it's all there?
i want to get it on tonight's news .
i'm e mailing you a copy .
it should be enough to bury wynn .
great .
daddy?
hey , sweetheart .
what are you doing here?
some unfinished business .
you disappoint me , terry .
you can't release the virus .
millions of people will die .
only those who refuse to join me .
you're a very lucky man .
whatever it is you want , just take it and go .
i intend to .
let's go .
on the floor .
the kid stays with me .
answer the door .
go on .
it's all right , sweetheart .
peek a boo .
i see you .
this place is hard to find in the dark .
i smell you're not wearing any panties .
hello , cyan .
remember me?
you were at my birthday party .
no duh .
what are you , a regular einstein?
you sure know how to raise them .
don't you touch her .
back off , hero .
i'm back by popular demand .
big as life and twice as rotten .
does wonders for my asthma .
where's spawn?
let's cut the crap .
spawn's on his way .
you ready to play?
of course i am .
you better be .
you don't know how much your heart means to me .
bring 'em , jerky .
come on .
help me , please .
careful .
don't make me nervous .
i might nick something vital .
get away from her .
i can't do that .
she wants me .
you touch her , and you die slow .
all right , spawn .
no more fun and games .
either you join hell's army , or she dies ... after i'm done .
i will rip your heart out !
let her go .
so what's it gonna be?
time's running out .
too late .
it's all your fault , spawn .
she was doing fine till you showed up .
now you've got nothing left to lose .
you're a soulless corpse !
nothing !
you're wrong .
i've still got you .
don't be afraid .
you can't kill me .
is that right?
if my heart stops , the virus is released , and everybody in the world dies .
like you said ...
i've got nothing else to lose .
that's right .
feel the burn .
get used to it .
it's payback time .
see you in hell , jason .
if you kill me , you kill her !
i'm through doing hell's dirty work .
you worthless bag of ...
how could you let him kill me?
the most important thing in your entire freakin 'universe !
whatever happened to love , honor , respect?
you pansy bacon crisp !
you should have killed him !
popped his head like a zit .
it feels ... so good .
and feel that butt .
it feels so ... hairy .
joke's over .
you should have killed jason when you had the chance .
never .
what do you mean never?
never?
do you know how hard i've been working on this?
you set me up , you malignant sow !
what do you think you got the pacemaker for?
your perfect attendance record , you spoon sucking dipstick?
i was counting on spawn killing you .
then you would get his soul ... and kick start the apocalypse now .
i say destroy the cosmos , ask questions later .
but first ... first , i want to slaughter each and every one of you .
and then i'm gonna have a little creme de wanda .
i'll let you watch , too .
yummy yum .
tastes like chicken .
cogliostro !
come and get me !
he'll be back .
concentrate on healing .
come on !
i may not be able to hold him off alone .
come on down to my world and die , suckers !
all right , you overgrown gecko ...
come and get your throat cut .
if you won't lead my army , then you must die .
never !
bring me spawn's head .
you will never escape me .
it's all right now , baby .
come on .
they belong together .
there's no place for me here .
maybe you're the one after all .
you were checking me out from the start , weren't you?
i'm too old for this .
not as quick as i used to be .
i've fought this war long enough .
it's time for someone to take over .
what if i sided with clown?
i'd have killed you .
right .
i followed him here .
thanks , kid .
use your armor !
concentrate !
bite this !
cut off his head !
you'll pay for this .
it's not over yet .
i'll gum you to death .
i'll bite you .
wanda , what do you think about a little head?
this is your last chance to join up .
think about it .
come on .
you'll pay for this .
give my regards to your boss .
tell him he's next .
i'm gonna die !
not bad for a dead man .
beginner's luck .
come on , folks .
let's move back , please .
is it true the documents you've uncovered ... implicate jason wynn?
yes .
for the past five years , i unwittingly participated ... in jason wynn's illegal manipulation of the a 6 ... to further his ambitions for worldwide power .
what took you so long to respond?
are the heat 16 bombs still a danger?
the entire heat 16 weapon system has already been destroyed .
do you have any further comments?
something i should have done a long time ago .
the documents i release to all media outlets ... will answer the rest of your questions .
thank you .

malebolgia's plans to destroy the earth .
the choice has been made .
for now .
