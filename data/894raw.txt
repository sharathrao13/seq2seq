hairy palms .
you know what we haven't done for years?
remember bruno hakalugi , the italian wrestler?
remember where bruno meets the invisible man?
why don't we do it where you play the samurai warrior?
i'll be bruno hakalugi , and we'll do the wrestling skit .
i used to love that skit .
welcome to championship wrestling .
i'm your host , jerry dumphy .
with me tonight is three time world heavyweight champion , mike mcgraw .
welcome to the show , iron mike .
thank you , jerry .
we have an excellent card on top for you tonight between the italian bruno hakalugi and his team partner , japanese ltchy scratchy .
how do the boys look for you , iron mike?
the italian looks pretty good .
the jap looks good .
they both look good .
their opponent tonight is none other than the world famous champion from nowhere .
the invisible man .
what do you think of him , iron mike?
well , i haven't seen too much of him lately .
in fact , no one has .
cos he's invisible .
but i think it's going to be a good match .
hakalugi and ltchy scratchy are certainly showing him no respect .
they're not showing him any respect at all .
but i don't think the invisible man is scared of them either .
they're deciding who is going to go in the ring first .
yeah , they're deciding who is going to go in the ring first .
they're having quite a discussion .
i can't understand what they're saying .
the invisible man is ready .
i think it's going to be the italian .
there goes the bell .
here we go .
it's no holds barred texas rules , no referee and no pay cheque for the loser .
and he gets hits by a shot out of nowhere .
and another shot out of nowhere .
he's down already .
quite a mess .
looks like the italian's in trouble .
got him in a lock .
and now he's got the japanese guy .
itchy scratchy into the ring .
he's looking around .
looking for a sneak attack .
and he's hit his rim .
and another rim shot .
that's illegal , but there's no referee so it doesn't matter .
he bit him .
that's good wrestling .
biting is allowed .
another rim shot .
here comes bruno hakalugi into the ring .
what is he doing?
he's probably digging for crabs .
he's eating garlic .
he's going to give him a garlic blowjob .
the japanese is down .
and now the knee drop !
and into the corner .
hard to get out this .
that's pretty tough on the back .
that's right , iron mike .
look at that one .
he's got him in the " got ya " .
he's got his hands full now .
he's really stretching .
he's slipped out .
must be the grease on his hands .
and he gives him another stretch .
and another stretch .
and over his shoulder for the volga boatman , marching to moscow .
he's down now .
couldn't see where he was going .
you can't see invisible balls .
that's right .
he's got him in the bass , man !
that's not orthodox wrestling .
he we go into double dutch .
listen to them hit the ground .
i'd say the invisible man's in a lot of trouble .
he looks pretty tied up .
i bet he can get out of it .
hakalugi is going to make a four corner run .
that really hurts , let me tell you .
it happened to me once .
hakalugi is down .
itchy scratchy too .
and the invisible man wins .
those balls are pretty dangerous when they're flapping around .
hey , cheech !
how can you stay in there that long?
you know one skit we got to do?
alice bowie in a sex club .
i am absolutely ruined .
i just got a phone call .
burt reynolds is definitely not coming .
he is in florida .
and miss dolly parton is in hospital .
they're not coming?
definite , for sure?
they phoned me .
that's too bad .
that's ok .
who needs burt reynolds?
we're here .
what have you got to worry about?
we'll do a great show .
don't worry about burt reynolds or dolly parton .
i lost my reputation .
i have no money .
who needs material possessions?
real tears .
hey , man .

you'll end up like spaghetti .
we'll have to scrape you up .
you've got nothing to worry about .
my son is nine .
my daughter is only ...
steven spielberg is a personal friend of mine .
i'll give him a call .
we have lunch at " i love sushi " in malibu all the time .
we'll have et over here .
you'll be a big success .
don't worry .

that looks good on you .
that looks slick .
you want to give me your watch?
here's one for your old lady too .
she likes that?
that's for my mother?
i really appreciate it .
thank you .
don't worry about nothing .
just show up at the theatre .
you'll see something you never saw before .
it'll be great .
don't worry about nothing .
but i have to think of my reputation .
don't worry about that .
it'll be cool in amsterdam .
thank you for the watches .
don't worry .
everything will be cool .
go home and take a lude or something .
we'll see you at the theatre .
thank you .
oh , wow .
that's a good looking watch .
thanks a lot .
all right .
look at that sucker .
is this too much?
'ladies and gentlemen , please welcome burt reynolds and dolly parton . '
i think there's been a mistake .
we're not burt and dolly ...
we're cheech and chong .
we're gonna do a show for you anyway .
and ...
we want to start off with a dude who had his arm blown off during the war .
he's real sensitive about it too .
you know , about his arm .
so let's give him a nice hand .
let's hear it for limey bitters .
see his arm?
thank you , ladies and gentlemen .
it's a great pleasure to be here tonight .
i'd like to perform for you all an unnatural act .
hello .
listen , man .
turn those mikes down .
can't you hear them?
they're feeding back .
turn 'em down .
and don't black out .
don't black out till we tell you to .
don't mess with anything .
just leave it as they are .
don't tell all those things .
there are a lot of important people .
they even expect the queen will come .
all the people from the secret service ...
don't use the word " bums " , don't use those languages .
i know what a lot of you people out there are thinking .
just what kind of act will this be?
let me tell you , ladies and gentlemen .
the act of which i speak ... is that i ... am the only person in the world who can play the trumpet ... out his nose .
that's right .
and not only that .
i will make this trumpet sound like a slide trombone .
i would like to play a tune called ,
nobody knows about me cares and nobody cares about me nose " .
out me nose ... or proboscis .
thank you very much .
here we go .
had a bit of a greenie stuck there .
all right .
thank you , ladies and gentlemen .
limey bitters .
he's a great talent .
a lot of people think we come here just for the drugs but that's true .
it's nice here .
i don't think you can smoke so light up .
