i never met a brother who didn't have faith .
i've stood in front of dozens of men ... who were all staring death in the face .
every single one of them begged for god's help .
after seeing all those pleas go unanswered ,
i ... lost my faith .
so what's the what?
my answer ... is this .
no .
i guess we're done here .

why don't we talk about the real reason ... <i>that you would come down here on new year's eve ... </ i> in the middle of this storm .
okay .
uh , let's see .
we had an appointment .
i think the real reason ... is you're in love with me .
huh .
interesting .
i can see it in your eyes .
that's why you come wearing these fancy clothes .
it's very flattering , but i think you should stop denying it , you know?
i hear ...
no , i hear you .
you're right .
you're right .
you're right .
my face obviously betrays me .
<i>i didn't get dressed up like this because i'm going to a new year's eve party later tonight . </ i>
oh , no .
no , sergeant .
this was all for you .
a form of seduction .
is it working?
wonderfully .
<i>i'm glad . </ i>
okay , well , we'll have to finish this conversation another time .
what is this thing here?
hey , hey , hey , hey !
that's mine .
all right , relax .
i don't care about the file .
so , uh , you got a desk job at precinct 21 , i see .
you don't quit , do you?
how do you feel about it?
how do i feel about it?
it's no big change .
so i guess the new year's not bringing anything different for you .
how's your leg , by the way?
i noticed you weren't limping anymore .
what's that supposed to mean?
it's just an observation .
five years of undercover work , and now this .
wow !

you must be itching to get back on the streets .
good bye .
happy new year .
happy new year to you .
i'll see you at the new precinct .

i've heard so much about this bishop guy over the years .
i wanna see him .
i thought you gave up bad boys .
get back inside .
it's not the new year yet , sarge .
you must be roenick .
no offense , officer , but i'm pretty fuckin 'perturbed about this .
<i>we're closing down .

i tried .
i'll give it another shot .

must've walked two miles in this damn weather .
i'm soaking .
look at me .
well , thank god you're not hurt .
so how did you enjoy your file?
oh , yeah , yeah .
you dropped this .
oh , really?
i dropped it?
that's strange , because i was sure that you took it .
definitely dropped it .
that's disappointing .
<i>if you had stolen it , it would've been the first time ... </ i> you were taking a proactive interest in your therapy .

so you read it .
yeah , i fuckin 'read it .
did you steal it?
you know i stole it , all right?
and stop being so goddamn happy about it , dr. sabian .
<i>it makes me sick . </ i>
i think he's hiding behind his injury .
he's not really hurt .
jake roenick no longer considers himself a cop .
<i>what kind of bullshit is that?
huh? </ i>
you think i'm scared?
that's what it is , right?
if you'd read further on , you would see that's not what i think .
all right , well , then tell me what it is that you think , dr. mrs. mind fuck .
<i>what is it that you think i'm hiding from? </ i>
i'm not gonna explain myself to you if you're gonna act like a child .
excuse me .
run away .
we both know you can't handle this shit , 'cause you want to fuck me .
sergeant , if i wanted to fuck you , it would've happened already .
gotta learn to control yourself , doc .
it's affecting your work .
it's very unprofessional .
don't try to discredit me because you're afraid i may be right .
<i>right?
yes . </ i>
about what?
come on .
tell me what it is you think i'm hiding from , and then i'll tell you whether i think you're right .
okay !
i believe that the prospect of responsibility has rendered you impotent !
impotent?
yes !
and that's why you're working at this old precinct behind a desk .
i'm injured , all right?
that's why i'm here .
bullshit !
you feel responsible for the death of your team eight months ago , and that's why you're here .
i didn't do anything wrong .
a board of inquiry cleared me .
that's right .
you didn't do anything wrong .
<i>but it was your decision that sent them down the left hallway ... </ i> and not the right , out the front door and not the back .
and you don't want to make decisions like that again .
yeah .
so?
maybe you're right .
what?
you want a medal?
so now you're hiding behind that desk .
and behind that liquor in your drawer ... and those ... pills in that stupid little matchbox .
but there's still one life you're responsible for , no matter where you go .
oh , let me guess .
my own?
yeah , your own .
and if you don't start taking care of yourself , you're never gonna be the cop you used to be .

everything's been packed !
roenick ! </ i>
get down !
get down !
jasper , get the blinds !
all right .
all right .
yeah , we're perfectly safe now .
these are just scare tactics , all right?
they don't know how much firepower we have or don't have .
<i>they're not gonna come in here again .
it's too risky . </ i>
what about us gettin 'out there , sergeant?
i i need help real bad .
i need it .
let's barricade up these doors and windows , and i'll figure out how to get some help in here .
what are you doing this for , jake?
nobody gives a shit anymore about anything .
we can end this right now .
i can't let a murderer walk out of here .
i can't do that .
i'll get us out of this , jasper .
i will .
i promise .
you got almost no chance out there , buddy .
that cop in there dies if i don't try .
you keep the place locked down until i get some help .
all right .
i'd better cover from the front windows .
i can see the truck better from there .
keep your head down .
schmuck .
oh , shit !
<i>oh , shit ! </ i>
i found this on our friend out there .
fuck it .
fact or fiction?
you pulled a guy's spine out once , didn't you?
<i>are you a surgeon? </ i>
<i>i heard that bullet you took in your belly is still lodged in there , rattling around . </ i>
<i>i bet you it's causing you a lot of intestinal issues .
right?
right , man? </ i>
<i>bishop , i need to talk to you . </ i>
so i just killed a man .
his name was danny barbero .
a cop .
a cop who works for ray portnow .
the man you killed .
<i>so tell me why cops are risking their lives to get to you , bishop . </ i>
why should i answer that question?
because i'm thinking about sending you out to the wolves and saving my own ass if you don't .
i assume you know who i am , sergeant .
you're a scumbag gangster .
and one of my scumbag partners in crime is your fellow officer , marcus duvall .
<i>marcus duvall and his entire team . </ i>
we used to split things 50 50 .
marcus got greedy .
he wanted more .
so you killed ray portnow .
after he tried to kill me .
mm .
right .
<i>they're here to execute me , because if i make it to court, </ i> every single one of them goes to jail for the rest of their days .
how many cops are involved in this?
i can't say exactly , but the blood money runs through your entire department .
i bet they're all here now , and they can't allow me to leave this precinct alive .
they can't allow any of us to leave here alive .
now that we all know it's them out there .
sarge .
<i>poor guy , he never had a chance .
anyone know if he had any family? </ i>
<i>someone's coming !
shit , someone's coming ! </ i>
someone's coming .
hit squad , sergeant .
they're here for all of us .
me?
all of us .
you especially .
<i>fuck you , dealer .
this is all your fault . </ i>
<i>those are your brethren out there , old man , not mine . </ i>
don't compare me with your scumbag friends out there .
if it was up to me , i'd kick your ass out the door .
i'd like to see you come try .
yeah , sure .
you'd love to kill another cop today , wouldn't you?
only you .
<i>they'll be coming on strong now . </ i>
why?
why are cops coming to kill us?
they need to kill him before he fingers them in court .
they need to kill us too , now that we know it's them .
so ... here's what we're gonna do .
we're gonna take positions all around the precinct , and we're gonna hold 'em off until dawn .
iris , alex , you know how to use a firearm?
no .
no .
why don't you give me one of them guns , sergeant .
i'll help you fend off the black hats .
oh .
oh , shit .
men are here .
good .
what a fuckin 'mess this is .
i know .
i'm lookin 'at this as a matter of simple mathematics .
if we walk and those eight people survive , then 33 lives are destroyed .
the lives of my men and their families .
people i'm responsible for .
people i ...
people i love .
i don't see any other way , marcus .
the blood trail leads right back to us .
we have no choice .
if we go through this , we are gonna have to live with this for the rest of our lives .
but you know something , mike?
i could live with that more than i could live with a cell mate .
<i>once we step outside, </ i> those people are no longer civilians or cops .
we gotta put 'em all down .
without pause , without regard .

obsessive compulsive disorder .
the complex problems force me to concentrate , neutralizing any feelings of fear i have at a given moment .
i hide behind its structure .
you're gonna be all right , doc .
we don't know that .
don't know that .
you're so calm .
thank you so much .
thanks .
you don't have to do this .
yes , i do .
i do .
if i'm gonna die , at least i should die gracefully .
how are you keeping it together?
i just think about living .
i want to live , as opposed to i don't want to die .
that , and i keep telling myself everybody's gonna make it this time .
we both know what could happen here , sergeant .
safety off .
yeah .
right .
all right !
wake up !
wake up !
wake up !
<i> all right , already .
come on .
get up . </ i>
oh , come on .
look , uh , here's the deal .
those men that came in here ... they're still outside .
<i>and ...
i have no idea how many there are ... </ i> or what they're prepared to do .
don't sweat it .
there's nothin 'you can do .
you can't stop bishop's people .
<i>go ahead , sergeant .
tell them . </ i>
they're not bishop's people .
they are police officers .
what !
po po " popping each other?
this is the fuckingest shit i ever seen .
this ain't smiley's fight , man .
let smiley go .
let me go .
<i>i totally figured it out . </ i>

smiley feels very fuckin 'unsafe .
it's scary .
i'm scared to death .
you can't use us as fuckin 'live bait .
come on .

we're hostages .
i know .
they're gonna come for us .
come on , man .
come on .
<i> you can't do that .
think about it .
please .
come on , man . </ i>
<i> you can't leave us here as fuckin 'animals to fuckin 'die !
smiley's scared shitless , man . </ i>
<i>please .
we're sittin 'ducks here .
come on .
don't leave us like this , man . </ i>
all right , choose a weapon .
anything you see .
<i>tell me again why we should help your little skinny white ass? </ i>
'cause if you don't , you'll die .
no resistance .
advancing to the front door .
we're going in .
<i>spread out across the precinct .

<i> we might make it through this night .
christ almighty .

you can't trust these people .
what the hell are you doin '?

maybe they'll leave for fucking good now .
they're not going anywhere .
put that goddamn weapon down .
j ...
old man , you do not wanna point that weapon at me .
<i>that is not a bright thing to do . </ i>
<i> put that goddamn weapon down slowly , then back away from it , all of ya ! </ i>
jake , get their weapons .
take their weapons .
ain't this a bitch .
we saved your asses .
now you wanna turn on us?
yeah , well , thank you for that , sweet cheeks .
now , put your weapon down .
the problem is outside , not inside .
put the gun down , jasper .
<i>no , no .
you know what the problem is?
that we criminals got rights , baby . </ i>
that's right .
we got rights to be protected against assault under any circumstances .
if you can't provide that , well , fuck you ... we will .
you're a fuckin 'psycho .
jesus christ , jake !
what?
are you gonna trust these freaks?
huh?
the first chance they get to blow our brains out , they'll try to make a break for it .
<i>they need us as much as we need them . </ i>
we all gotta start trusting each other right now if we're gonna make it through this night .
put the gun down , jasper .
put the goddamn gun down !
what?
<i> shit .
all right .
all right . </ i>
now , let's all introduce ourselves to each other .
it's new year's eve .
let's turn over a new leaf .
all right .
let's not all fuckin 'speak at once .
the name's smiley .
i'm a libra , and ...
i'll handle these jokers .
you handle your people , maybe we get out of here tonight .
he armed his prisoners .
it's a smart play .
must be at least eight guns in there now .
just a couple hours till the sun's up .
if we can't breach , what do we do?
get the a. v. 5 here .
are you sure about that?
yep .
i'm not takin 'any more chances .
it's gonna take a while in this weather .
marcus?
what the fuck do we do if it doesn't arrive in time?
we'll have to think of some other way of ending this .
you either flirting with me or clocking my game 'cause you don't trust me .
i don't like your beady little eyes all over my goodies , so turn the fuck away .
you're manipulative , weak knees and that sexy copper complexion .
you're definitely an aries , baby .
you're pretty good .
smiley thanks you .
<i>we got something in common , you know that? </ i>
you comin 'down off some shit , ain't ya?
don't be ashamed , man .
don't be ashamed .
what's your poison?
seconal to bring me down .
adderall to bring me back up .
you gotta get up to get down .
oh , yeah , baby .
oh , yeah .
all right .
that's enough .
come on .
let's pay attention .
i want a cigarette so bad .
stupid new year's resolutions .
hey , gangster , you make any resolutions?
hmm?
what do you think , secretary?
oh , my god .
i can't stop thinking about sex .
<i>i mean , i usually think about sex a lot , but this is crazy . </ i>
<i>sex and death are very closely related . </ i>
the greeks called it eros and thanatos ... love and death .
<i>or sex as a way of nullifying thoughts of dying . </ i>
what's your deal , gangster?
you actually been shot five times?
six .
you really pull a man's spine out?
it was an adam's apple .
if you ever get into tussles , secretary , you grab a man by his throat , hmm?
dig it?
and then you squeeze .
i guarantee you he will drop .
he will not get up for quite some time .
oh , god .
it's really quiet out there now .
yeah .
that's what worries me .
<i>we're not gonna make it till morning .
marcus duvall will not allow it . </ i>
we've got eight people covering six entry points .
if we work together , we will make it .
look at it this way .
that's me out there .
you think i'd let you survive until the morning?
we don't have a lot of options here .
well , we got to figure something ,
'cause i'm not gonna stay here all night waitin 'to get killed .
if you use the situation to try and escape , it's about me and you ,
'cause when this is over , you're goin 'back to jail .
relax , sergeant .
" relax .
this ain't about me and you .
not yet .
our shit's on pause , huh?
yeah .
our shit's on pause .
you saved my ass back there .
why?
everyone in here is my responsibility .
it's my job .
that's noble .
unfortunately , i don't share the sentiment .
i see a cop in jeopardy , he's on his own , unless it benefits me to jump in for the save .
<i>listen .
i don't try to be anything i'm not . </ i>
that ain't gonna change ; i don't care what day it is .
<i>you remember that , sergeant . </ i>
<i>hey !
someone's comin '. </ i>
oh , god .
it's capra , sarge !
<i>you know this guy?
he's a cop .
he works here . </ i>
they'll execute him .
capra !
shh !
yeah .
drive .
drive !
<i>oh , my god .
he's gonna make it .
he still has to get by the sniper . </ i>
<i>come on , capra ! </ i>
he's still moving .
they didn't get him yet .
<i>where are you going? </ i>
come on .
come on .
<i>come on , capra !
come on ! </ i>
come on !
what the fuck is goin 'on?
who's fuckin 'shootin 'at us , sarge?
who the fuck are all these people?
<i>what are you doin 'here , capra?
what are you doin 'here? </ i>
it's new year's eve .
i knew you'd be here alone .
i came to have a drink with iris .
you picked the wrong night to make your move , baby , believe me .
you know , that's really sweet .
that's really sweet , but , unfortunately , i don't believe a fuckin 'word of it .
put that goddamn weapon down , you psycho !
he works here !
i don't care that he fuckin 'works here , man .
he could be a plant .
<i>no , jasper .
put the gun down , all right?
let's not start that again , all right? </ i>
<i>he comes here in the guise of courting that lady .
it's a fuckin 'ingenious plan . </ i>
they get one of their boys in here and then take us out one by one by one .
come on .
tell 'em .
they shot at him .
all right?
they shot at him .
oh , yeah , yeah , yeah .
oh , but they conveniently fuckin 'missed , didn't they?
the act is a fuckin 'charade !
<i>come on .
tell 'em .
he's fuckin 'right , anna . </ i>
<i>isn't it a fucking charade?
do i have a gun? </ i>
<i>do i have a fucking gun?
i can't hurt you . </ i>
it's not fuckin 'good enough , rat bitch .
come on .
just lock him up , man , so he doesn't do any damage .
<i>come on .
come on , roenick .
listen to me , man .
we're not lockin 'this man up . </ i>
not in my precinct , all right?
i vouch for him .
okay .
okay , i'm fuckin 'sorry , but your authority has been super fuckin 'seded .
<i>you understand?
you're not in charge anymore . </ i>
right , bish?
bish , tell 'em .
<i>he could be one of them , man , so fuckin 'easily . </ i>
<i>you don't think we see right through you?
fuckin 'believe that shit? </ i>
<i>comes in here playing that game , playing stupid .
you don't think we know? </ i>
right , man?
let's do the math .
let's put him away , man , just play it safe , you know?
put it down .
no , no , no .
come on .
come on , man .
come on .
just do the math .
come on .
motherfucker comes in like that , playing ...
come here .
sergeant roenick is in charge .
understand?
yes .
let's go .
only because i respect you .
but i still say this shit is fuckin 'lllogical bullshit , all right?
he may not be who he says he is .
just mull that shit over .
think it over .
think it over , man .
iris , look after capra , fill him in on what's goin 'on .
all right , capra?
just be cool so no one else here gets spooked .
everybody else , back to your positions .
thank you .
don't .
that was self preservation .
the more men we have , the better chance we stand .
are you sure you vouch for this man?
i do .
come with me .
you know , i hate to admit it , but smiley agrees with what you said back there .
smiley want a fuckin 'medal?
hear me out , man .
look , we're out of our shackles for what?
the last time in the next 15 , 20 years?
all right , man .
get to the point .
what do you want?
listen to me , man .
look out that window .
that's freedom , baby .
<i>get what i'm sayin '? </ i>
look , maybe this new year's can bring something different for us after all .
beck like smiley now .
eight months ago he loses his team when a deal goes sour .
problem with drugs and alcohol since the incident .
burned out cop .
only a matter of time before he drops his guard .
watch the truck .
they'll eye it as a way out .
what's the word on the a. v.?
storm's starting to let up , so it shouldn't be long now .
good .
someone gets inside , takes off , goes for help .
it's too obvious .
we'd need a distraction .
we also need the keys .
your cop said he dropped 'em in the snow .
<i> i could hot wire a car .
i thought you never committed a crime in your life? </ i>
i haven't .
yeah .
<i>just picked up some shit along the way .
whoa .
hold on . </ i>
how do we know she's not just gonna drive out of here and leave us all here to die?
who the fuck are you , miss fuckin 'little skirt?
shake that skinny ass in somebody else's face .
okay , anna .
no offense , but i'll feel better if somebody goes with you .
maybe i should go .
i promise i'll make her get help .
scout's honor .
<i>it's either me or jasper .
can't be . </ i>
we need your guns .
it's gotta be ...
<i>me . </ i>
