ok , go on through .
all metal objects into the tray .
purpose of visit?
a patient pick up and transfer to smith's grove .
you're late .
yeah .
should be on the road .
yeah .
hell of a night , huh?
real charmer .
yeah .
i'll take you down there .
all right .
let them in .
ok .
first time here , huh?
hope it's the last time .
you never get used to the faces .
never .
jesus !
jesus ain't got nothing to do with this place .
come on .
yeah , this is where the society dumps its worst nightmares .
yeah the one you're picking up ...
just thinking about him gives me the willies .
a decade ago , halloween night ...
he murdered 16 people ... maybe more .
trying to get to his sister .
nearly got her too .
but his doctor ... of all people , shot him ... six times .
then he set him on fire .
both of them nearly burned to death .
yeah , i'll be glad to see this one gone .
yes , indeedy !
welcome to hell .
doctor?
yes?
the transfer personnel are here .
smith's grove?
yes .
i'm dr. hoffman , medical administrator .
has he been prepped?
ready to go .
who signs for him?
i do .
outside .
check him out .
i'd assumed dr. loomis would be here .
michael myers is still his patient .
well , if loomis read memos , he'd be here .
fortunately his position is more ceremonial than medical .
and with myers gone ...
my hope is that he'll either transfer ... retire ... or die .
all right , let's move him .
watch it .
i got this end .
i can safely say that michael myers is now in your hands .
yeah .
i guess you're happy to see him go .
locked and loaded .
let's roll .
night , doc .
drive carefully .
did hoffman say anything about living relatives?
yeah .
a niece living in his hometown .
and?
and? " she's too young to be his legal ward .
so the state owns him?
great .
you know , i still don't understand .
no !
kido ...
it's 4 : 00 in the morning .
i can't sleep .
what is this?
four nights in a row?
you going for a record here?
the seven year old insomniac's hall of fame?
do you love me , rachel?
serious questions tonight .
of course i love you .
like a sister?
jamie , sometimes it's ...
like a real sister?
we're not really sisters , jamie .
but that doesn't mean that i love you any less .
sure it does .
i know you miss your parents .
it hasn't been that long .
it's been 11 months .
your mother used to baby sit me when i was your age .
i'll bet you didn't know that .
you're lucky .
i wish she could do the same for me .
come on , jamie .
let's go back to bed .
come on , sunday .
sleep tight .
we'll have french toast for breakfast , ok?
nighty night .
come on , sunday .
nighty night .
now i lay me down to sleep , i pray the lord my soul to keep .
if i should die before i wake , i pray the lord my soul will take .
god bless mr. and mrs. corruthers .
god bless rachel , god bless sunday , god bless me .
and god bless mommy and daddy in heaven .
amen .
help me please !
somebody help me !
help me !
jamie !
oh , dear god !
it's all right , sweetheart .
a bad dream .
that's all .
just a nasty old dream .
i've got you .
you're safe now , see?
it's okay , baby .
it's okay .
it's okay .
shh .
you're gonna be just fine .
it's okay , baby .
you're gonna be fine .
damn it !
darlene !
there's a clean one in the laundry room next to your blue slacks .
hello?
honey , this tie's got a spot on it .
i can't wear this today .
i got a 10 : 30 with chuck .
hang on , mrs. pierce .
not that tie .
on the other side .
that's not the only thing you're eating , rachel !
mom , i'm on a diet .
you want an oinker for a daughter?
found it .
sorry .
do you suppose susan could just bring her crutches?
stupid question .
tell her i hope she feels better .
susan's mother .
she can't baby sit tonight .
why not?
susan broke her ankle last night at the ice rink .
rachel?
mom , please .
you'll have to watch jamie tonight .
not tonight .
i've got that date with brady .
you know how important that is .
well .
tonight is very important for your father and me .
can't you find somebody else?
it's too late .
what am i supposed to tell brady?
sorry , but i've got to baby sit my foster sister .
go and have fun by yourself .
it's not exactly the end of the world for goodness 'sake .
oh , sure it is .
i think tonight brady was ready to make a commitment .
but now , my future relationship my engagement ... my marriage , my children and your grandchildren have all been wiped out , because i have to baby sit .
i'm sorry i ruined everything .
if i wasn't here , you could go out .
good job , rachel .
that little girl needs all the love we can give her right now .
and all you can do is think about yourself?
jamie?
i'm sorry .
i didn't mean it like that .
i can go out with brady tomorrow night .
it's no big deal .
but you wanted to go out tonight .
it's my fault you can't .
well , tonight we're going to do something better .
we're going to go trick or treating .
i don't want to .
it's halloween !
i mean : don't you want to get dressed up in a really scary costume and get some candy?
how 'bout this afternoon i pick you up from school and we go get ice cream?
double scoops?
double scoops .
now let's get some breakfast .
dr. quinn , call 7402 .
why wasn't i notified?
about what?
you know damn well about what .
you let them take it out of here .
for christ's sake , spare me the speech .
i've listened to it for a decade .
the fact is that michael myers was a federal patient and a federal prisoner .
therefore he's subject to federal law .
we're not talking about any ordinary prisoner , hoffman .
we are talking about an evil on two legs .
i can see this is useless .
do you know what today is?
do you know the date?
every day i look at myself in the mirror and ...
and every day i remember .
look at me ...
hoffman !
take a good look !
i don't want anyone to have to live through that night again .
i've said this before .
i think you're the one who needs mental help .
yes?
dr. hoffman .
i see .
i see .
thank you .
apparently there was an accident just south of mill creek near the bri ...
loomis?
loomis !
is that it?
yes .
when did this happen?
sometime in the night .
they probably lost the road in the storm .
come down the embankment .
it happens .
an accident?
yes , sir .
do you believe that?
why shouldn't i?
how many people in the bus?
four ... plus myers .
how many bodies did you find?
it's hard to tell , they're all chewed up .
loomis?
it's over .
leave it alone .
he's gone .
he was here ... ... but he's gone .
did you find any other bodies?
not yet .
there's a lot of ground to cover .
you won't find him .
he's done all this .
now he's escaped .
you don't know that .
michael could've been thrown from the bus .
i've seen bodies thrown 50 60 feet from a crash site .
even if by some miracle michael's conscious ... his ... his muscles would be totally useless .
give the troopers a chance to search .
you're talking about him as if he were a human being .
that part of him died years ago .
now where are you going?
haddonfield .
it's a four hour drive .
you can reach me through the local police .
if you don't find him in four hours ...
i'm sure i will .
hey gar .
how 'bout a 9/ 16 socket over here?
hey !
hey there !
hello !
hello?
hello?
is anybody here?
hello?
hello !
is anybody here?
god in heaven .
michael?
why now?
you waited ten years .
i knew this day would come .
don't go to haddonfield .
if you want another victim , take me .
but leave those people in peace .
please ...
michael .
goddamn you .
michael !
hey jamie !
where's your costume?
where's your mask?
or are you wearing it?
i don't need to wear a stupid costume !
that's because every day is halloween at jamie's house .
right , jamie?
'cause your uncle's the boogeyman .
boogeyman !
boogeyman !
jamie's uncle's the boogeyman !
how come your mommy didn't make you a costume , jamie?

her mommy's dead .
jamie's mommy's ... a mummy !

jamie's an orphan !
jamie's an orphan !

jamie's an orphan !
jamie's an orphan !
jamie's uncle's the boogeyman !

i know .
don't you wanna talk to him?
i don't wanna look pushy .
you won't look pushy .
well , i don't wanna come on too strong .
a guy hates a girl that comes on too strong .
fragile egos , and all of that .
you won't come on too strong .
well , i don't wanna seem desperate or anything .
face it rach , you are desperate .
you're just gonna go in and buy a costume for jamie .
perfectly legit .
i don't know .
well ...

jamie?
discount mart .

you bet .
hey , wade .
why don't you go ahead and make your move?
don't rush me , brady .
timing's gotta be premo .
yeah well , money talks and bullshit walks .
you know what i mean?
double or nothing , you don't ask kelly out .
all right .
ten bucks .
let's see it .
he's not gonna do it .
chicken .
don't forget , man .
she's sheriff meeker's daughter .
her daddy don't scare me .
fuck off , wade .
hey , maybe you can come over right now .
oh , cool !

i'm ready !
okay , let's go .
ah , i need to speak with sheriff brackett .
then you'll have to travel about 3, 000 miles south of here .
what?
brackett retired .
back in '81 .
he moved to st. petersburg .
oh , well , who's the new sheriff?
i am .
ben meeker .
oh , sheriff meeker ... my name is dr. ...
loomis .
folks around here aren't likely to forget your face .
at least not cops .
so , what brings you back here after ten years?
michael myers ... has escaped from ridgemont .
he's here in haddonfield .
that's impossible .
michael myers is an invalid .
he's here , sheriff .
why?
ten years ago ...
he tried to kill laurie strode .
now he wants her daughter .
are you talking about jamie lloyd?
wherever she is , that little child is in mortal danger .
myers has been locked up since before she was born .
he's never laid eyes on her .
six bodies ...
sheriff !
that's what i've seen between here and ridgemont .
a filling station in flames !
i tell you , michael myers is here in this town !
he's here to kill that little girl and anybody who gets in his way .
all right , pierce , call the troopers and check his story out .
and assuming what you say is true .
it's true , sheriff !
all right , all right .
it's true .
what the hell can we do to avoid a repeat of ten years ago?
find this little girl .
get her someplace safe .
call the local tv station .
tell them to get people off the streets and behind locked doors .
can't get long distance , sheriff .
operator says the lines are down .
all right , let's go .
when he makes that call ...
all right , pierce , do it .
let's check on this little girl .
thanks .
jamie , wait for me .
this is great , rachel .
come on !
trick or treat .
oh , my , what a scary little clown .

no explanation .
will you just hold on a second?

no , you don't understand .
i mean you blew off our date at the last minute .
so you hop onto the next best thing?
i thought you were different from other guys .
i'm different .
it's just that ...
i just got pissed off ... that's all .

well , i'll just let you get back to little ms. hot panties .
rachel !
jamie?
brady?

jamie !
jamie !
great , rachel ... just great .
by order of the sheriff's office , all citizens of haddonfield are asked to clear the streets .
i made that payment nine days ago and still have nothing ...
you were right .
everybody , shut up a goddamn minute !
shut up !
all businesses are asked to close as soon as possible .
what's that shit about , earl?
stay tuned to the station for updates .
not like ol 'ben meeker do something like that .
sure ain't .
martians could land on ben's doorstep and all he'd do is spit once and get himself a shotgun .
who are you calling?
police station .
ain't closing down without a good goddamn reason .
well?
just rings .
well , come on !
jackie , watch the register for me , hon .
you got it , earl .
what's going down?
where are we going , earl?
we're going to ben's .
the phone never just rings at a police station , no way , no how .
wake up the sheriff .
load it up .
come on , come on .
something?
he's been here .
how do you know?
this is starting to spook me , doc .
at least i'm not alone .
logan ...
i want you to stay here in case the family gets back .
right here , ben .
you look sharp .
you understand?
no problem , sheriff .
hey , you !
this is city property .
no trespassing .
what are you , deaf?
don't try that halloween shit with me .
all right , i'm on the telephone to the police right now .
don't you even think about leaving .
yeah !
that was a fun !
come on , kids , we're going in the car right now .
come on .
i said move in , get in there .
jamie !
jamie !
rachel , is that you?
is that you?
jamie?
jamie?
jamie?
jamie?
oh , god !
jamie .
whoever you are ...
i have a big dog with me and he bites !
jamie !
where have you been?
don't ever go off on your own at night again .
okay?
not ever .
rachel , jamie , thank god !
what's going on?
get in the car .
come on , quick .
is that him?
is that him !?
yes .
loomis .
oh , christ .
doc .
dear god .
hey , don't shoot !
oh , that was great !
you thought it was me , didn't you?
sheriff !
get home , damn it !
there's a curfew !
i catch your ass , it'll be a weekend in jail !
you all right , doc?
come on .
we'll get to the station .
we'll get these kids safe .
it's okay .
station , this is 132 . come in , pierce .
come in , pierce .
come in , pierce .
oh , christ !
wouldn't have given up without a fight .
they didn't know , what they were fighting .
how can a man do this , loomis?
tell me .
it isn't a man .
what is he?
tell me !
what the hell are we dealing with?
evil .
what the sam hill is going on?
go on home , earl .
this is police business .
what the hell did this?
looks like to me you're out of business .
now i want some answers .
i haven't got the time or the patience to argue with you .
now go home to your families where you belong .
it was michael myers .
he's come home to kill .
let it be , earl .
let the police handle it .
like the last time?
how many people killed back then?
how many kids?
al here , lost his boy ten years back .
well not this time , ben .
i'll handle this my own way .
we're gonna fry his ass .
you son of a bitch !
you just created a lynch mob .
you haven't got a police force !
these men may be the only defense you've got .
ok , let's move it up .
come on guys , let's go .
let's hunt this bastard !
god help us .
132 , 132 , this is 134 , over .
this is 132 , over .
ben uh ...
i just heard about the station .
now you go over to my house and we'll call the state boys from there .
i'll be there in five minutes .
honey , i don't think they're home .
how do you know they are not home?
'cause the lights are all out .
i told them to be here by 9 : 30 .
it's not 9 : 30 yet .
come on , let's call the carters .
come on , come on .
you call the carters .
kids?
rachel?
jamie?
there he is !
i've seen his face .
right there , al
right there in the bushes .
come on .
shit , earl !
it's ted hollister .
you dumb son of a bitch .
you said , you saw myers .
let's go upstairs .
huh?
no .
i think we're doing just fine right here .
oh , i think i'm in heaven !
oh , brady .
oh , brady .
oh , shit .
oh , it's my dad !
your dad?
your dad !
god , if he catches us like this ... ... he's gonna skin you alive ...
what? ... for starters .
oh , no .
come on !
i'm going .
i'm going .
where's that deputy?
he'll be here in a minute .
rachel , take your sister upstairs .
first door on the right .
dad , what's going on?
kelly , i want you to close and lock all the downstairs windows .
why?
just do it !
where's the radio?
right through the kitchen you'll see the basement stairs .
brady , you know how to use a gun?
yes , sir .
think you can handle that?
um , yeah .
you wanna tell me what's happening?
yeah , when i have time .
you got your riot gun?
in the trunk of my squad .
go get it .
take these .
okay , you got a hammer ... and roofing nails .
and i want you up in the attic securing it , so nobody can get in .
you know , if something's happening , i should just go call my parents .
just get up in the attic .
oh yeah .
i catch you groping my daughter ...
i'll use that shotgun on you .
you understand?
now get the outside shutters .
what are we doing?
making sure that no one can get in here .
isn't all this a little paranoid?
if you'd seen that police station , you wouldn't even ask .
you two okay?
we've been better .
what's going on?
michael myers .
who's that?
ten years ago ...
halloween .
he's jamie's uncle .
the kids at school were right .
i'm gonna be outside ... upstairs in the attic .
that's all the windows , dad .
all right .
good , good .
logan , i want you right here by the front door , ok?
this is the dead bolt key .
all right ,
we're secure .
i now padlocked the back door .
this is the only way in and out of this house .
you got that?
you got it , ben .
i want you to go make us some coffee .
all right .
ah , shit !
hello?
who's there?
can we go home soon , rachel?
real soon , jamie .
now , shh .
how's it powered?
batteries .
i'd planned a generator for the house next week .
i wish i hadn't waited .
this is squawk 79 o zero haddonfield broadcasting on a state police emergency frequency .
can anyone hear me?
can anyone hear me?
damn it !
everything all right?
jamie's sleeping .
when can we go home?
state police will be here soon .

the state police won't know how to stop him .

it might be nobody knows how to stop him .
but i've got to try .
are you looking for this?
i didn't know you and brady had anything , okay?
you knew .
you just didn't care !
he's not married .
