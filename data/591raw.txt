hi honey .
hi mom .
you feeling any better?
a little bit .
guess what .
what?
grandfather's here .
mom , can't you tell him that i'm sick?
you're sick , that's why he's here .
he'll pinch my cheek .
i hate that .
maybe he won't .
hey !
how's the sickie?
heh?
i think i'll leave you two pals alone .
i brought you a special present .
what is it?
open it up .
a book? !
that's right .
when i was your age , television was called books .
and this is a special book .
it was the book my father used to read to me when i was sick , and i used to read it to your father .
and today , i'm gonna read it to you .
has it got any sports in it?
are you kidding?
fencing .
fighting .
torture .
revenge .
giants .
monsters .
chases .
escapes .
true love .
miracles .
it doesn't sound too bad .
i'll try and stay awake .
oh .
well , thank you very much .
very nice of you .
your vote of confidence is overwhelming .
all right .
the princess bride " , by s. morgenstern .
chapter one .
buttercup was raised on a small farm in the country of florin .
her favorite pastimes were riding her horse and tormenting the farm boy that worked there .
his name was westley , but she never called him that .
isn't that a wonderful beginning?
yeah .
it's really good .
nothing gave buttercup as much pleasure as ordering westley around .
farm boy .
polish my horse's saddle .
i want to see my face shining in it by morning .
as you wish .
as you wish " was all he ever said to her .
farm boy .
fill these with water please .
as you wish .
that day , she was amazed to discover that when he was saying , " as you wish , " what he meant was , " i love you .
and even more amazing was the day she realized she truly loved him back .
farm boy , fetch me that pitcher .
as you wish .
hold it , hold it .
what is this?
are you trying to trick me?
where's the sports?
is this a kissing book?
wait , just wait .
when it gets good?
keep your shirt on .
let me read .
westley had no money for marriage .
so he packed his few belongings and left the farm to seek his fortune across the sea .
it was a very emotional time for buttercup .
i don't believe this .
i fear i'll never see you again .
of course you will .
but what if something happens to you?
i will always come for you .
but how can you be sure?
this is true love .
you think this happens every day?
westley didn't reach his destination .
his ship was attacked by the dread pirate roberts , who never left captives alive .
when buttercup got the news that westley was murdered ,
murdered by pirates is good .
she went into her room and shut the door .
and for days , she neither slept nor ate .
i will never love again .
five years later , the main square of florin city was filled as never before to hear the announcement of the great prince humperdinck's bride to be .
my people !
a month from now , our country will have its 500th anniversary .
on that sundown , i shall marry a lady who was once a commoner like yourselves , but perhaps you will not find her common now .
would you like to meet her?
yes !
my people the princess buttercup !
buttercup's emptiness consumed her .
although the law of the land gave humperdinck the right to choose his bride , she did not love him .
despite humperdinck's reassurance that she would grow to love him , the only joy she found was in her daily ride .
a word , my lady?
we are but poor , lost circus performers .
is there a village nearby?
there is nothing nearby .
not for miles .
then there will be no one to hear you scream .
what is that you're ripping?
it's fabric from the uniform of an army officer of guilder .
who's guilder?
the country across the sea .
the sworn enemy of florin .
go !
once the horse reaches the castle , the fabric will make the prince suspect the guilderians have abducted his love .
when he finds her body dead on the guilder frontier , his suspicions will be totally confirmed .
you never said anything about killing anyone .
i've hired you to help me start a war .
it's a prestigious line of work with a long and glorious tradition .
i just don't think it's right , killing an innocent girl .
am i going mad or did the word " think " escape your lips?
you were not hired for your brains , you hippopotamic land mass .
i agree with fezzik .
oh !
the sot has spoken .
what happens to her is not truly your concern .
i will kill her .
and remember this never forget this when i found you , you were so slobbering drunk you couldn't buy brandy .
and you friendless , brainless , helpless , hopeless ,
do you want me to send you back to where you were , unemployed in greenland?
that vizzini , he can fuss .
fuss ... fuss ...
i think he likes to scream at us .
probably he means no harm .
he's really very short on charm .
oh , you've a great gift for rhyme .
yes , some of the time .
enough of that !
fezzik , are there rocks ahead?
if there are , we'll all be dead .
no more rhymes now , i mean it .
anybody want a peanut?
we'll reach the cliffs by dawn .
why are you doing that?
making sure nobody's following us .
that would be inconceivable .
despite what you think , you will be caught .
of all the necks on this boat , highness , the one you should be worrying about is your own .
stop doing that .
we can all relax , it's almost over .
you're sure nobody's following us?
as i told you , it would be absolutely , totally , and in all other ways , inconceivable .
no one in guilder knows what we've done .
and no one in florin could have gotten here so fast .
out of curiosity , why do you ask?
no reason .
it's only , i just happened to look behind us , and something is there .
what? !
probably some local fisherman out for a pleasure cruise at night , through eel infested waters ...
go in , get after her !
i don't swim .
i only dog paddle .
veer left .
left .
left !
do you know what that sound is , highness?
those are the shrieking eels .
if you doubt me , just wait .
they always grow louder when they're about to feed on human flesh .
if you swim back now , i promise , no harm will come to you .
i doubt you will get such an offer from the eels .
she doesn't get eaten by the eels at this time .
what?
the eel doesn't get her .
i'm explaining to you because you look nervous .
i wasn't nervous .
well , maybe i was a little bit concerned .
but that's not the same thing .
because i can stop now if you want .
no .
you could read a little bit more ... if you want .
do you know what that sound is , highness?
those are the shrieking eels .
we're past that , grandpa .
you read it already .
oh .
oh my goodness , i did .
i'm sorry .
beg your pardon .
all right , let's see .
she was in the water , the eel was coming after her .
she was frightened .
the eel started to charge her .
and then
put her down .
just put her down .
i think he's getting closer .
he's no concern of ours .
sail on !
i suppose you think you're brave , don't you?
only compared to some .
look !
he's right on top of us .
i wonder if he is using the same wind we are using .
whoever he is , he's too late see?
the cliffs of insanity .
hurry up .
move the thing ... that other thing .
move it !
we're safe .
only fezzik is strong enough to go up our way , he'll have to sail around for hours 'til he finds a harbor .
he's climbing the rope .
and he's gaining on us .
inconceivable !
faster !
i thought i was going faster .
you were supposed to be this colossus .
you were this great , legendary thing .
and yet he gains .
well , i'm carrying three people .
and he got only himself .
i do not accept excuses ,
i'm just going to have to find myself a new giant , that's all .
don't say that , vizzini .
please .
did i make it clear that your job is at stake?
he has very good arms .
he didn't fall?
inconceivable !
you keep using that word .
i do not think it means what you think it means .
my god !
he's climbing .
whoever he is , he's obviously seen us with the princess , and must therefore die .
you , carry her .
we'll head straight for the guilder frontier .
catch up when he's dead .
if he falls fine .
if not the sword .
i'm going to duel him left handed .
you know what a hurry we're in !
it's the only way i can be satisfied .
if i use my right , it'll be over too quickly .
oh , have it your way .
you be careful .
people in masks cannot be trusted .
i'm waiting !
hello there .
slow going?
look , i don't mean to be rude , but this is not as easy as it looks ,
so i'd appreciate it if you wouldn't distract me .
sorry .
thank you .
i do not suppose you could speed things up?
if you're in such a hurry , you could lower a rope , or a tree branch , or find something useful to do .
i could do that .
in fact , i've got some rope up here .
but i do not think that you will accept my help , since i am only waiting around to kill you .
that does put a damper on our relationship .
but i promise i will not kill you until you reach the top .
that's very comforting .
but i'm afraid you'll just have to wait .
i hate waiting .
i could give you my word as a spaniard .
no good .
i've known too many spaniards .
you don't know any way you'll trust me?
nothing comes to mind .
i swear on the soul of my father , domingo montoya ,
you will reach the top alive .
throw me the rope .
thank you .
we'll wait until you're ready .
again .
thank you .
i do not mean to pry , but you don't by any chance happen to have six fingers on your right hand?
do you always begin conversations this way?
my father was slaughtered by a six fingered man .
he was a great swordmaker , my father .
and when the six fingered man appeared and requested a special sword , my father took the job .
he slaved a year before he was done .
i have never seen its equal .
the six fingered man returned and demanded it , but at one tenth his promised price .
my father refused .
without a word , the six fingered man slashed him through the heart .
i loved my father , so , naturally , i challenged his murderer to a duel ...
i failed .
the six fingered man did leave me alive , but he gave me these .
how old were you?
i was eleven years old .
when i was strong enough , i dedicated my life to the study of fencing .
so the next time we meet , i will not fail .
i will go up to the six fingered man and say ,
hello , my name is inigo montoya .
you killed my father .
prepare to die .
you've done nothing but study swordplay?
more pursuit than study lately .
you see , i cannot find him .
it's been twenty years now .
i am starting to lose confidence .
i just work for vizzini to pay the bills .
there's not a lot of money in revenge .
well , i certainly hope you find him , someday .
you are ready , then?
whether i am or not , you've been more than fair .
you seem a decent fellow .
i hate to kill you .
you seem a decent fellow .
i hate to die .
begin !
you're using bonetti's defense against me , ah?
i thought it fitting , considering the rocky terrain .
naturally , you must expect me to attack with capo ferro .
naturally , but i find thibault cancels out capo ferro , don't you?
unless the enemy has studied his agrippa , which i have .
you are wonderful !
thank you , i've worked hard to become so .
i admit it , you are better than i am .
then why are you smiling?
because i know something you don't know .
and what is that?
i am not left handed .
you're amazing !
i ought to be after twenty years .
there's something i ought to tell you .
tell me .
i am not left handed either .
who are you? !
no one of consequence .
i must know .
get used to disappointment .
okay .
kill me quickly .
i would as soon destroy a stained glass window as an artist like yourself .
however , since i can't have you following me either ...
please understand , i hold you in the highest respect .
inconceivable !
give her to me .
catch up with us quickly .
what do i do?
finish him , finish him .
your way .
oh , good , my way .
thank you , vizzini .
which way is my way?
pick up one of those rocks , get behind the boulder , in a few minutes , the man in black will come running around the bend .
the minute his head is in view , hit it with the rock !
my way's not very sportsmanlike .
i did that on purpose .
i don't have to miss .
i believe you .
so what happens now?
sportsmanlike .
no tricks , no weapons , skill against skill alone .
you mean , you'll put down your rock and i'll put down my sword , and we'll try to kill each other like civilized people?
i could kill you now .
frankly , i think the odds are slightly in your favor at hand fighting .
it's not my fault being the biggest and the strongest .
i don't even exercise .
look , are you just fiddling around with me or what?
i just want you to feel you're doing well .
i hate for people to die embarrassed .
you're quick .
and a good thing too .
why do you wear a mask?
were you burned by acid , or something like that?
oh no .
it's just that they're terribly comfortable .
i think everyone will be wearing them in the future .
i just figured out why you give me so much trouble .
why is that , do you think?
well , i haven't fought just one person for so long .
i've been specializing in groups .
battling gangs for local charities , that kind of thing .
why should that make such a difference?
well , you see , you use different moves when you're fighting half a dozen people than when you only have to be worried about one .
i don't envy you the headache you will have when you awake .
but , in the meantime , rest well ... and dream of large women .
there was a mighty duel .
it ranged all over .
they were both masters .
who won?
how did it end?
the loser ran off alone .
the winner followed those footprints toward guilder !
shall we track them both?
the loser is nothing .
only the princess matters .
clearly this was all planned by warriors of guilder .
we must be ready for whatever lies ahead .
could this be a trap?
i always think everything could be a trap , which is why i'm still alive .
so , it is down to you .
and it is down to me .
if you wish her dead , by all means keep moving forward .
let me explain there's nothing to explain .
you're trying to kidnap what i've rightfully stolen .
perhaps an arrangement can be reached?
there will be no arrangement and you're killing her !
but if there can be no arrangement , then we are at an impasse .
i'm afraid so .
i can't compete with you physically .
and you're no match for my brains .
you're that smart?
let me put it this way : have you ever heard of plato , aristotle , socrates?
yes .
morons .
really?
in that case , i challenge you to a battle of wits .
for the princess?
to the death?
i accept !
good .
then pour the wine .
inhale this , but do not touch .
i smell nothing .
what you do not smell is called iocane powder .
it is odorless , tasteless , dissolves instantly in liquid , and is among the more deadlier poisons known to man .
all right : where is the poison?
the battle of wits has begun .
it ends when you decide and we both drink , and find out who is right and who is dead .
but it's so simple .
all i have to do is divine from what i know of you .
are you the sort of man who would put the poison into his own goblet , or his enemy's?
now , a clever man would put the poison into his own goblet , because he would know that only a great fool would reach for what he was given .
i'm not a great fool , so i can clearly not choose the wine in front of you .
but you must have known i was not a great fool . you would have counted on it , so i can clearly not choose the wine in front of me .
you've made your decision then?
not remotely .
because iocane comes from australia , as everyone knows .
and australia is entirely peopled with criminals .
and criminals are used to having people not trust them , as you are not trusted by me .
so i can clearly not choose the wine in front of you .
truly , you have a dizzying intellect .
wait till i get going !
where was i?
australia .
yes , australia .
and you must have suspected i would have known the powder's origin , so i can clearly not choose the wine in front of me .
you're just stalling now .
you'd like to think that , wouldn't you?
you've beaten my giant , which means you're exceptionally strong .
so , you could have put the poison in your own goblet , trusting on your strength to save you .
so i can clearly not choose the wine in front of you .
but , you've also bested my spaniard , which means you must have studied .
and in studying , you must have learned that man is mortal so you would have put the poison as far from yourself as possible , so i can clearly not choose the wine in front of me .
you're trying to trick me into giving away something it won't work .
it has worked you've given everything away i know where the poison is .
then make your choice .
i will .
and i choose ...
what in the world can that be?
what?
where?
i don't see anything .
oh , i could have sworn i saw something .
no matter .
what's so funny?
i'll tell you in a minute .
first , let's drink : me from my glass , and you from yours .
you guessed wrong .
you only think i guessed wrong that's what's so funny !
i switched glasses when your back was turned .
you fool !
you fell victim to one of the classic blunders .
never get involved in a land war in asia .
never go in against a sicilian when death is on the line .
who are you?
i am no one to be trifled with , that is all you ever need know .
to think , all that time it was your cup that was poisoned .
they were both poisoned .
i spent the last few years building up an immunity to iocane powder .
someone has beaten a giant .
there will be great suffering in guilder if she dies .
catch your breath .
if you'll release me ... whatever you ask for ransom you'll get it , i promise you ...
and what is that worth , the promise of a woman?
you're very funny , highness .
i was giving you a chance .
no matter where you take me ... there's no greater hunter than prince humperdinck .
he could track a falcon on a cloudy day .
he can find you .
you think your dearest love will save you?
i never said he was my dearest love .
and yes , he will save me .
that i know .
you admit me you do not love your fiance?
he knows i do not love him .
are not capable of love is what you mean .
i have loved more deeply than a killer like yourself could ever dream .
that was a warning , highness .
the next time , my hand flies on its own .
for where i come from , there are penalties when a woman lies .
iocane .
i'd bet my life on it .
and there are the princess's footprints .
she is alive ... or was , an hour ago .
if she is otherwise when i find her , i shall be very put out .
rest , highness .
i know who you are , your cruelty reveals everything .
you're the dread pirate roberts .
admit it !
with pride .
what can i do for you?
you can die slowly cut into a thousand pieces .
hardly complimentary , your highness .
why loose your venom on me?
you killed my love .
it's possible .
i kill a lot of people .
who was this love of yours?
another prince , like this one , ugly , rich , and scabby?
no .
a farm boy .
poor .
poor and perfect .
with eyes like the sea after a storm .
on the high seas , your ship attacked , and the dread pirate roberts never takes prisoners .
i can't afford to make exceptions .
i mean once word leaks out that a pirate has gone soft , people begin to disobey you , and then it's nothing but work , work , work , all the time .
you mock my pain !
life is pain , highness .
anyone who says differently is selling something .
i remember this farm boy of yours , i think .
this would be , what , five years ago?
does it bother you to hear?
nothing you can say will upset me .
he died well , that should please you .
no bribe attempts or blubbering .
please .
please , i need to live .
it was the " please " that caught my memory .
i asked him what was so important for him .
true love , he replied .
and then he spoke of a girl of surpassing beauty and faithfulness .
i can only assume he meant you .
you should bless me for destroying him before he found out what you really are .
and what am i?
faithfulness he talked of , madam .
your enduring faithfulness .
now , tell me truly .
when you found out he was gone , did you get engaged to your prince that same hour , or did you wait a whole week out of respect for the dead?
you mocked me once , never do it again !
i died that day !
you can die too , for all i care !
as ... you ... wish ...
oh , my sweet westley !
what have i done?
he disappeared .
he must have seen us closing in , which might account for his panicking in the error .
unless i'm wrong , and i am never wrong , they are headed dead into the fire swamp .
can you move at all?
move? !
you're alive .
if you want , i can fly .
i told you , i would always come for you .
why didn't you wait for me?
well , you were dead .
death cannot stop true love .
all it can do is delay it for a while .
i will never doubt again .
there will never be a need .
oh no .
no , please .
what is it?
what's the matter?
they're kissing again .
do we have to hear the kissing part?
someday , you may not mind so much ...
skip on to the fire swamp , that sounded good .
oh .
you're sick i'll humor you .
so now , where were we here?
yeah , yeah , yeah .
okay .
westley and buttercup raced along the ravine floor .
ha !
your pig fiance is too late .
a few more steps and we'll be safe in the fire swamp .
we'll never survive .
nonsense .
you're only saying that because no one ever has .
it's not that bad .
well , i'm not saying i'd like to build a summer home here , but the trees are actually quite lovely .
well now , that was an adventure .
singed a bit , were you?
you?
well , one thing i will say .
the fire swamp certainly does keep you on your toes .
this will all soon be but a happy memory , because roberts 'ship " revenge " is anchored at the far end
and i , as you know , am roberts .
but how is that possible?
since he's been marauding twenty years and you only left me five years ago?
i myself am often surprised at life's little quirks .
you see , what i told you before about saying " please " was true .
it intrigued roberts , as did my descriptions of your beauty .
finally , roberts decided something .
all right , westley , i've never had a valet .
you can try it for tonight .
i'll most likely kill you in the morning .
good night , westley .
good work .
sleep well .
i'll most likely kill you in the morning .
it was a fine time for me .
i was learning to fence , to fight , anything anyone would teach me .
and roberts and i eventually became friends .
and then it happened .
what?
go on .
roberts had grown so rich , he wanted to retire .
so he took me to his cabin and told me his secret .
i am not the dread pirate roberts " , he said , " my name is ryan .
i inherited this ship from the previous dread pirate roberts " ,
just as you will inherit it from me .
the man i inherited it from was not the real dread pirate roberts , either .
his name was cummerbund .
the real roberts has been retired fifteen years
and living like a king in patagonia .
then he explained the name was the important thing for inspiring the necessary fear .
you see , no one would surrender to the dread pirate westley .
so we sailed ashore , took on an entirely new crew and he stayed aboard for awhile as first mate , all the time calling me roberts .
once the crew believed , he left the ship and i have been roberts ever since .
except , now that we're together , i shall retire and hand the name over to someone else .
is everything clear to you?
we'll never succeed , we may as well die here .
no , no .
we have already succeeded .
i mean , what are the three terrors of the fire swamp?
one : the flame spurts .
no problem .
there's a popping sound preceding each , we can avoid that .
two : the lightning sand .
but you were clever enough to discover what that looks like , so in the future we can avoid that too .
westley , what about the r. o. u. s. 's?
rodents of unusual size?
i don't think they exist ...
westley !
we did it .
now , was that so terrible?
surrender !
you mean you wish to surrender to me?
very well , i accept .
i give you full marks for bravery , don't make yourself a fool .
ah , but how will you capture us?
we know the secrets of the fire swamp .
we can live there quite happily for some time , so , whenever you feel like dying , feel free to visit .
i tell you once again : surrender !
it will not happen !
for the last time : surrender !
death first !
will you promise not to hurt him?
what was that?
what was that?
if we surrender , and i return with you , will you promise not to hurt this man?
may i live a thousand years and never hunt again .
he is a sailor on the pirate ship " revenge .
promise to return him to his ship .
i swear it will be done .
once we're out of sight , take him back to florin and throw him in the pit of despair .
i swear it will be done .
i thought you were dead once , and it almost destroyed me .
i could not bear it if you died again , not when i could save you .
come , sir .
we must get you to your ship .
we are men of action .
lies do not become us .
well spoken , sir
what is it?
you have six fingers on your right hand , someone was looking for you ...
where am i?
the pit of despair .
don't even think ...
don't even think about trying to escape .
the chains are far too thick .
and don't dream of being rescued either .
the only way in is secret .
and only the prince , the count and i know how to get in and out .
then i'm here till i die?
till they kill you , yeah .
then why bother curing me?
the prince and the count always insist on everyone being healthy before they're broken .
so it's to be torture .
i can cope with torture .
you don't believe me?
you survived the fire swamp .
you must be very brave ... but nobody withstands ... the machine .
she's been like that ever since the fire swamp .
it's my father's failing health that's upsetting her .
of course .
the king died that very night , and before the following dawn , buttercup and humperdinck were married .
and at noon , she met her subjects again .
this time as their queen .
my father's final words were ...
hold it .
hold it , grandpa .
you read that wrong .
she doesn't marry humperdinck , she marries westley .
i'm just sure of it .
after all that westley did for her , if she does not marry him , it wouldn't be fair .
well , who says life is fair?
where is that written?
life isn't always fair .
i'm telling you you're messing up the story , now get it right !
do you want me to go on with this?
yes .
all right , then .
no more interruptions .
at noon , she met her subjects again .
this time as their queen .
love her as i loved her , and there will be joy .
queen buttercup .
why do you do this?
because you had love in your hands , and you gave it up .
but they would have killed westley if i hadn't done it .
your true love lives and you marry another .
true love saved her in the fire swamp , and she treated it like garbage .
and that's what she is , the queen of refuse !
so , bow down to her if you want .
bow to her .
bow to the queen of slime , the queen of filth , the queen of putrescence .
boo !
boo !
rubbish !
filth !
slime !
muck !
boo !
boo !
it was ten days till the wedding .
the king still lived , but buttercup's nightmares were growing steadily worse .
see?
didn't i tell you she'd never marry that rotten humperdinck?
yes , you're very smart .
shut up .
i love westley .
i always have .
i know now i always will .
if you tell me i must marry you in ten days , please believe i will be dead by morning .
i could never cause you grief .
consider our wedding off .
you returned this westley to his ship?
yes .
then we will simply alert him .
beloved , are you certain he still wants you?
after all , it was you who did the leaving in the fire swamp .
not to mention that pirates are not known to be men of their words .
my westley will always come for me .
i suggest a deal .
you write four copies of a letter .
i'll send my four fastest ships .
one in each direction .
the dread pirate roberts is always close to florin this time of year .
we'll run up the white flag and deliver your message .
if westley wants you , bless you both .
if not ... please consider me as an alternative to suicide .
are we agreed?
your princess is really a winning creature .
a trifle simple , perhaps , but her appeal is undeniable .
oh , i know .
the people are quite taken with her .
it's odd , but when i hired vizzini to have her murdered on our engagement day ,
i thought that was clever .
but it's going to be so much more moving when i strangle her on our wedding night .
once guilder is blamed , the nation will be truly outraged .
they'll demand we go to war .
now , where is that secret knot?
it's impossible to find .
are you coming down into the pit?
westley's got his strength back .
i am starting him on the machine tonight .
tyrone , you know how much i love watching you work , but i've got my country's 500th anniversary to plan , my wedding to arrange , my wife to murder , and guilder to frame for it .
i'm swamped .
get some rest , if you haven't got your health , you haven't got anything .
beautiful , isn't it?
it took me half a lifetime to invent it .
i'm sure you've discovered my deep and abiding interest in pain .
at present i'm writing the definitive work on the subject .
so i want you to be totally honest with me on how the machine makes you feel .
this being our first try , i'll use the lowest setting .
as you know , the concept of the suction pump is centuries old .
well , really , that's all this is .
except that instead of sucking water , i'm sucking life .
i've just sucked one year of your life away .
i might one day go as high as five , but i really don't know what that would do to you .
so , let's just start with what we have .
what did this do to you?
tell me .
and remember , this is for posterity , so be honest , how do you feel?
interesting .
yellin .
sire .
as chief enforcer of all florin , i trust you with this secret : killers from guilder are infiltrating the thieves 'forest and plan to murder my bride on our wedding night .
my spy network has heard no such news .
any word from westley?
too soon , my angel .
patience .
he will come for me .
of course .
she will not be murdered .
on the day of the wedding , i want the thieves 'forest emptied and every inhabitant arrested .
many of the thieves will resist .
my regular enforcers will be inadequate .
form a brute squad then .
i want the thieves 'forest emptied before i wed .
it won't be easy , sire .
try ruling the world sometime .
the day of the wedding arrived .
the brute squad had their hands full carrying out humperdinck's orders .
is everybody out?
almost .
there's a spaniard giving us some trouble .
well , you give him some trouble .
move !
i am waiting for you , vizzini .
you told me to go back to the beginning .
so i have .
this is where i am , and this is where i'll stay .
i will not be moved .
ho there .
i do not budge .
keep your " ho there .
but the prince gave orders .
so did vizzini .
when a job went wrong , you went back to the beginning .
and this is where we got the job .
so it's the beginning , and i'm staying till vizzini comes .
you !
brute !
come here .
i am waiting for vizzini .
you surely are a meanie .
hello .
it's you .
true !
you don't look so good .
you don't smell so good either .
perhaps not .
i feel fine .
fezzik and inigo were reunited .
and as fezzik nursed his inebriated friend back to health , he told inigo of vizzini's death and the existence of count rugen , the six fingered man .
considering inigo's lifelong search , he handled the news surprisingly well .
fezzik took great care in reviving inigo .
that's enough .
that's enough !
where is this rugen so i may kill him?
he's with the prince in the castle .
but the castle gate is guarded by thirty men .
how many could you handle?
i don't think more than ten .
leaveing twenty for me .
at my best , i could never defeat that many .
i need vizzini to plan .
i have no gift for strategy .
but vizzini's dead .
no , not vizzini .
i need the man in black .
what?
look , he bested you with strength , your greatness .
he bested me with steel .
he must have out thought vizzini , and a man who can do that can plan my castle's onslaught any day .
let's go .
where?
to find the man in black , obviously .
but you don't know where he is .
don't bother me with trifles , after twenty years , at last , my father's soul will be at peace .
there will be blood tonight !
rise and report .
the thieves 'forest is emptied .
thirty men guard the castle gate .
double it .
my princess must be safe .
the gate has but one key and i carry that .
ah !
my dulcet darling .
tonight we marry .
tomorrow morning , your men will escort us to florin channel where every ship in my armada waits to accompany us on our honeymoon .
every ship but your four fastest , you mean .
every ship but the four you sent .
yes .
yes , of course .
naturally , not those four .
your majesties .
you never sent the ships .
don't bother lying .
it doesn't matter .
westley will come for me anyway .
you're a silly girl .
yes , i am a silly girl , for not having seen sooner that you were nothing but a coward with a heart full of fear .
i would not say such things if i were you .
why not?
you can't hurt me .
westley and i are joined by the bonds of love .
and you cannot track that .
not with a thousand bloodhounds .
and you cannot break it .
not with a thousand swords .
and when i say you are a coward , that is only because you are the slimiest weakling ever to crawl the earth .
i would not say such things if i were you !
you truly love each other and so you might have been truly happy .
not one couple in a century has that chance , no matter what the storybooks say .
and so i think no man in a century will suffer as greatly as you will .
not to fifty !
fezzik , fezzik , listen , do you hear?
that is the sound of ultimate suffering .
my heart made that sound when rugen slaughtered my father .
the man in black makes it now .
the man in black?
his true love is marrying another tonight , so who else has cause for ultimate suffering?
excuse me , pardon me , it's important .
fezzik , please .
everybody ... move !
thank you .
where is the man in black?
you get there from this grove , yes?
fezzik , jog his memory .
i'm sorry , inigo .
i didn't mean to jog him so hard .
inigo?
father , i have failed you for twenty years .
now our misery can end .
somewhere ... somewhere close by is a man who can help us .
i cannot find him alone .
i need you .
i need you to guide my sword .
please .
guide my sword .
he's dead .
it just is not fair .
grandpa , grandpa .
wait , wait .
what did fezzik mean , " he's dead?
i mean , he didn't mean " dead " ...
westley's only faking , right?
you want me to read this or not?
who gets humperdinck?
i don't understand .
who kills prince humperdinck?
at the end , somebody's got to do it .
is it inigo?
who?
nobody .
nobody kills him .
he lives .
you mean he wins?
jesus , grandpa !
what did you read me this thing for?
you know , you've been very sick and you're taking this story very seriously .
i think we better stop now .
no !
i'm okay .
i'm okay .
sit down .
all right?
okay , all right , now , let's see .
where were we?
oh yes .
in the pit of despair .
well , we montoyas have never taken defeat easily .
come along , fezzik , bring the body .
the body?
have you any money?
i have a little .
i just hope your savings are enough to buy us a miracle thats all
go away !
are you the miracle max who worked for the king all those years?
the king's stinking son fired me .
and thank you so much for bringing up such a painful subject .
while you're at it , why don't you give me a nice paper cut and pour lemon juice on it?
we're closed !
beat it or i'll call the brute squad .
i'm on the brute squad .
you are the brute squad .
we need a miracle , it's very important .
look , i'm retired .
besides , why would you want someone the king's stinking son fired?
i might kill whoever you wanted me to miracle .
he's already dead .
he is , eh?
i'll take a look .
bring him in .
i've seen worse .
sir , sir !
we're really in a terrible rush .
don't rush me , sonny .
you rush a miracle man , you get rotten miracles .
you got money?
65 .
i never worked for so little , except once , and that was a very noble cause .
this is noble , sir .
his wife is crippled , his children are on the brink of starvation .
are you a rotten liar .
i need him to help avenge my father , murdered these twenty years .
your first story was better .
where's that bellows?
he probably owes you money , huh?
well , i'll ask him .
he's dead .
he can't talk .
look who knows so much .
well , it just so happens that your friend here is only " mostly dead " .
there's a big difference between " mostly dead " and " all dead " .
please open his mouth .
now , mostly dead is slightly alive .
now , all dead ... well , with all dead , there's usually only one thing that you can do .
what's that?
go through his clothes and look for loose change .
hey !
hello in there .
hey !
what's so important?
what you got here that's worth living for?
true ... love ...
true love .
you heard him .
you could not ask for a more noble cause than that .
sonny , true love is the greatest thing in the world .
except for a nice mlt , a mutton , lettuce and tomato sandwich , where the mutton is nice and lean and the tomato is ripe .
they're so perky , i love that .
but that's not what he said .
he distinctly said " to blave " .
and , as we all know , " to blave " means " to bluff " .
so you're probably playing cards , and he cheated ...
liar !
liar !
get back , witch !
i'm not a witch , i'm your wife .
but after what you just said , i'm not even sure i want to be that anymore .
you never had it so good .
true love " , he said .
true love , max .
my god !
don't say another word , valerie .
he's afraid .
ever since prince humperdinck fired him , his confidence is shattered .
why'd you say that name?
you promised me that you would never say that name .
what , humperdinck?
humperdinck .
humperdinck !
humperdinck .
humperdinck .
i'm not listening .
a life expiring and you don't have the decency to say why you won't help .
nobody's hearing nothing !
humperdinck !
humperdinck !
this is buttercup's true love .
if you heal him , he will stop humperdinck's wedding .
shut up !
wait .
i make him better , humperdinck suffers?
humiliations galore !
that is a noble cause .
give me the sixty five , i'm on the job .
that's a miracle pill?
the chocolate coating makes it go down easier .
but you have to wait 15 minutes for full potency .
and you shouldn't go swimming after , for at least , what?
an hour .
yeah , an hour .
a good hour .
thank you for everything .
okay .
bye bye , boys .
have fun storming the castle .
think it'll work?
it would take a miracle .
bye !
bye !
inigo , there's more than thirty ...
what's the difference?
we've got him .
help me here .
we'll have to force feed him .
has it been fifteen minutes?
we can't wait the wedding's in half an hour and we must strike in the hustle and the bustle beforehand .
tilt his head back .
open his mouth .
how long do we have to wait before we know if the miracle works?
your guess is as good as mine ...
i'll beat you both apart .
i'll take you both together ! ... i guess not very long .
why won't my arms move?
you've been mostly dead all day .
we had miracle max make a pill to bring you back .
who are you?
are we enemies?
why am i on this wall?
where's buttercup?
let me explain ...
no , there is too much .
let me sum up .
buttercup is marrying humperdinck in a little less than half an hour ,
so all we have to do is get in , break up the wedding , steal the princess , make our escape .
after i kill count rugen .
that doesn't leave much time for dilly dallying .
you've just wiggled your finger .
that's wonderful .
i've always been a quick healer .
what are our liabilities?
there is but one working castle gate ...
... and it is guarded by sixty men .
and our assets?
your brains , fezzik's strength , my steel .
that's it?
impossible .
if i had a month to plan , maybe i could come up with something .
but this ...
you just shook your head that doesn't make you happy?
my brains , his steel , and your strength against sixty men , and you think a little head jiggle is supposed to make me happy?
i mean , if we only had a wheelbarrow , that would be something .
where did we put that wheelbarrow the albino had?
over the albino , i think .
well , why didn't you list that among our assets in the first place?
what i wouldn't give for a holocaust cloak .
there we cannot help you .
will this do?
where did you get that?
at miracle max's .
it fit so nice , he said i could keep it .
all right , all right .
come on , help me up .
now , i'll need a sword eventually .
why?
you can't even lift one .
true , but that's hardly common knowledge , is it?
thank you .
now , there may be problems once we're inside .
i'll say !
how do i find the count?
once i do , how do i find you again?
once i find you again , how do we escape?
don't pester him , he's had a hard day .
right , right , sorry .
inigo .
what?
i hope we win ...
you don't seem excited , my little muffin .
should i be?
brides often are , i'm told .
i do not marry tonight .
my westley will save me .
marriage .
marriage is what brings us together today .
marriage , that blessed arrangement , that dream within a dream ...
stand your ground , men !
stand your ground !
i am the dread pirate roberts !
there will be no survivors .
now?
not yet .
my men are here , and i am here , but soon you will not be here .
now?
light him .
the dread pirate roberts takes no survivors .
all your worst nightmares are about to come true .
and love , true love , will follow you forever ...
the dread pirate roberts is here for your souls !
stay where you are .
i said stay where you are !
so treasure your love ...
skip to the end .
have you the ring?
here comes my westley now .
fezzik , the portcullis .
your westley is dead .
i killed him myself .
then why is there fear behind your eyes?
give us the gate key .
i have no gate key .
fezzik , tear his arms off .
oh , you mean this gate key .
and do you , princess buttercup ...
man and wife " , say " man and wife " !
man and wife .
escort the bride to the honeymoon suite , i'll be there shortly .
he didn't come .
kill the dark one and the giant , but leave the third for questioning .
hello .
my name is inigo montoya .
you killed my father .
prepare to die .
fezzik !
i need you !
i can't leave him alone .
he's getting away from me !
fezzik .
please !
i'll be right back .
thank you
strange wedding .
yes .
a very strange wedding .
come along .
what was that for?
because you've always been so kind to me .
and i won't be seeing you again since i'm killing myself once we reach the honeymoon suite .
won't that be nice?
she kissed me !
sorry , father .
i tried .
i tried ...
you must be that little spanish brat i taught a lesson to all those years ago .
it's simply incredible .
have you been chasing me your whole life only to fail now?
i think that's the worst thing i ever heard .
how marvelous .
there's a shortage of perfect breasts in this world .
it would be a pity to damage yours .
oh , westley , darling !
westley , why won't you hold me?
gently .
at a time like this that's all you can think to say?
gently "?
gently !
good heavens .
are you still trying to win?
you've got an overdeveloped sense of vengeance .
it's going to get you into trouble some day .
hello .
my name is inigo montoya .
you killed my father .
prepare to die .
hello .
my name is inigo montoya .
you killed my father .
prepare to die .
hello .
my name is inigo montoya .
you killed my father .
prepare to die .
stop saying that !
hello .
my name is inigo montoya .
you killed my father !
prepare to die !
power too , promise me that .
all that i have and more .
please ...
offer me everything i ask for .
anything you want .
i want my father back , you son of a bitch !
oh , westley , will you ever forgive me?
what hideous sin have you committed lately?
i got married .
i didn't want to .
it all happened so fast .
it never happened .
what?
it never happened .
but it did .
i was there .
this old man said , " man and wife .
did you say , " i do "?
well , no , we sort of skipped that part .
then you're not married .
if you didn't say it , you didn't do it
wouldn't you agree , your highness?
a technicality that will shortly be remedied .
but first things first ...
to the death !
no .
to the pain !
i don't think i'm quite familiar with that phrase .
i'll explain .
and i'll use small words so that you'll be sure to understand , you wart hog faced buffoon .
that may be the first time in my life a man has dared insult me .
it won't be the last .
to the pain means the first thing you lose will be your feet , below the ankles , then your hands at the wrists , next your nose . and then my tongue , i suppose .
i killed you too quickly the last time , a mistake i don't mean to duplicate tonight .
i wasn't finished !
the next thing you lose will be your left eye , followed by your right ... and then my ears , i understand .
let's get on with it
wrong !
dear god , what is that thing? " , will echo in your perfect ears .
that is what " to the pain " means .
it means i leave you in anguish , wallowing in freakish misery forever .
i think you're bluffing .
it's possible , pig , i might be bluffing .
it's conceivable , you miserable vomitous mass , that i'm only lying here because i lack the strength to stand , then again , perhaps i have the strength after all .
drop your sword !
have a seat !
tie him up .
make it as tight as you like .
where's fezzik?
i thought he was with you .
no .
in that case ...
help him .
why does westley need helping?
because he has no strength .
i knew it !
i knew you were bluffing !
i knew he was bluffing .
shall i dispatch him for you?
thank you , but no .
whatever happens to us ,
i want him to live a long life alone with his cowardice .
inigo !
inigo , where are you?
ah , there you are .
inigo , i saw the prince's stables , and there they were , four white horses .
and i thought , there are four of us , if we ever find the lady
hello , lady ! so i took them with me , in case we ever bumped into each other .
i guess we just did .
fezzik , you did something right .
don't worry .
i won't let it go to my head .
you know , it's very strange ,
i have been in the revenge business so long , now that it's over , i don't know what to do with the rest of my life .
have you ever considered piracy?
you'd make a wonderful dread pirate roberts .
they rode to freedom .
and as dawn arose , westley and buttercup knew they were safe .
a wave of love swept over them .
and as they reached for each other ...
what?
what?
no , it's kissing again .
you don't want to hear it .
i don't mind so much ...
okay .
since the invention of the kiss , there have been 5 kisses that were rated the most passionate , the most pure .
this one left them all behind .
the end .
now i think you ought to go to sleep .
okay .
okay .
okay .
all right .
shalom !
grandpa?
maybe you could come over and read it again to me tomorrow .
as you wish ...
