shit .
henry , it's 1 : 00 .
i was drumming for an idea .
yeah .
i heard .
jason , sit down .
sit down .
and after an arduous disembowelment procedure ... ... the body was hauled off to a marshy area ... ... placed atop a large pyre , where it was slowly devoured by vultures and rodents ... ... while the tribe looked on and danced .
a man dies , he's gotta serve his tribe .
you don't have a tribe , henry .
yes , i do .
you're my tribe .
you and the boy .
and sky there .
aren't you , sky?
keep looking for your funeral idea ... ... because your tribe is not dancing while rodents eat you .
jason .
i want us to go on a trip .
i know you do , henry .
yeah .
one last dig .
we'll fix up the van .
what?
it's a perfectly good ...
it's not perfectly good .
it's a classic .
there's nothing wrong with that van .
look , i'll see you in the morning , all right?
i may not make it to the morning .
well , wake me up before you kick so i can tell you what i really think of you .
hey .
something's different about my nanny .
she's a nurse .
well , whatever she is , she gave me a woody .
goddamn it .
well , i guess that's natural .
well , of course it's natural .
i didn't say an alligator came out of my ass .
good night , henry .
yeah?
how can you watch this?
they relax me .
in denmark , we didn't have horror .
henry asked for your father again .
we should find him .
i don't know how to do that .
you see that screaming woman?
she is the mother of that bloody person .
family is important at death .
good night , katrina .
good night .
dad .
papa henry's drumming again .
come on .
hey , dad?
are we gonna make papa henry into a mummy when he dies?
did he tell you that?
no , we're not gonna make him into a mummy , zach .
are we gonna stuff him?
henry .
what do you want?
come out of there .
a priest wore that 1000 years ago .
where'd you get it?
i stole it .
stole it right out of the goddamn ground .
that's what an archeologist does .
can we not advocate theft until he's at least old enough to drive , please?
nonsense .
some things want to be stolen .
the lair family have a history of thievery , zach .
it's nothing to be ashamed of .
now , banking , there's a shameful occupation .
jason .
can i see you?
what is it?
your father is downstairs .
he wants to cross threshold .
what?
threshold .
do you think the drumming made him come?
who?
your father .
you're jason .
kind of like two dogs , huh?
excuse me?
i got your letter about henry .
i sent it four years ago .
you got ... ... my letters?
when you were a kid , i wrote .
sent money too , i think .
dad?
come here , baby .
it's cold .
who are you?
granddad .
that's how it works , i think .
you're not dead anymore .
resurrected .
what the hell is going on?
henry ...
turner is outside .
goddamn , boy .
you came back .
you came back .
get me dressed .
my family's going out to a fancy place .
katrina , bring a chair over .
come join us .
this is family time .
you're not eating , jason .
you know i don't like chicken , henry .
what about you , turner?
you wanna eat some bird?
vegetarian .
fucking hell .
what in god's name has happened to the men in this family?
language , henry .
my mom's a vegetarian .
where is she?
we're separated ...
they're getting a divorce .
it's a trial separation .
she's painting in nipple .
nepal , zach .
it's nepal .
nipple is funnier .
nipple is funnier .
yeah .
yeah .
where's your wife?
she died .
long time ago .
are you still a criminal?
zach .
henry said he was a criminal .
it's nice having the family together again , huh?
nice , happy , normal family .
hey .
whiskey for everyone .
i like whiskey .
skoal !
want a snort , turner?
henry .
i can't drink it anymore .
i'll take some .
jesus .
okay .
soda , water , i don't give a crap .
let's have a toast .
to my boys .
they came back .
cheers .
cheers .
hey .
katrina , come ...
take a picture .
jason , come here .
get close .
so are you ready?
we're ready .
smile .
is it okay?
yeah .
remember that?
new mexico .
we're going back .
all of us .
we'll take a trip .
the family .
i can't , henry .
of course you can .
we'll fix up the van .
one last dig .
all of us .
but i'm catching a bus in the morning .
a bus?
where to?
you just got back , son .
i mean ... ... you just got home .
i can't stay , henry .
you're not ready .
you're still on the stairway .
zach , i'm serious .
give it to me .
it's bedtime , zach .
are you glad your dad's not dead anymore?
he never was dead , zach .
are you happy to see him?
sure , i am .
henry .
some of us ... ... are more broken than others .
what are you talking about , henry?
a family carries each other .
i carried you .
you carried me .
we have to carry him .
leave me .
what just happened?
i don't know .
well , what did you and henry just talk about?
i told him i had to leave .
leave when?
in the morning .
i'm catching a bus .
it got him upset , i think .
okay , jason , i go see him .
your bed is ready .
you and the boy go to the zoo a lot .
yeah , we go on sundays .
every sunday?
usually .
what do you do?
i work at a bank .
i mean at the zoo .
can we not do this?
henry wanted to see you before he died , but i don't feel like ... ... filling in the blank of my life before your bus .
they're all dicks .
if they stay or go , if they're mean or nice .
we're dads .
we're dicks .
it's not our fault .
he's not my father .
why did he leave?
i have no idea .
he just left?
my mom and i were in this car accident when i was 2 .
that's how i hurt my leg .
she died .
afterwards , turner just shot dope around the clock ... ... till he finally just disappeared .
and then he showed up today .
after 30 years?
fuck .
he's still your father .
would you stop saying that .
he's your father .
he's not my father .
henry is .
maybe .
luke , join me .
come to the dark side .
george lucas didn't make that up .
that shit happens .
can i get a shot for my friend yoda here , please?
i need your help , boy .
what's albuquerque?
it's where we're going , son .
only ... ... that's gonna be our secret .
okay?
i need your word , zach .
good lad .
sit down .
hello?
what?
they're where?
they're coming , sir .
go back to sleep , zach .
the boys are coming .
the boys are coming .
zach .
so , what's with the bag?
what's in it?
i don't know .
chicken , i guess .
henry wouldn't have just given us chicken , turner .
i'd stay if i could .
be okay with all ...
all this?
i'm sorry about henry .
and i'm ...
i'm sorry about earlier too .
i just ...
we haven't exactly had time to sit down ...
is this about now?
what?
is it about now , because if it's about a lot of ancient stuff ... ... we can't do anything about , then i don't want to discuss it .
do you like horror?
no .
want coffee?
no .
socially acceptable drug .
coffee .
ever do heroin?
no .
that's good .
you sure you don't want coffee?
no .
i made a pot .
what time is your bus?
i'm gonna have to miss it .
this from henry?
son of a bitch .
he did it .
that's a will?
yes .
and it's very cogent too .
he even had it witnessed .
he's got a cook ...
at a kentucky fried chicken stand , albert?
come on .
their literature refers to them as restaurants .
and i think they prefer kfc , but anyway , it's a cook ... ... and one of the customers , dorothy o'connor .
oh , henry .
she had the two piece box .
what's she doing?
there used to be a door here .
mom , this isn't our apartment .
we live upstairs .
right here .
so , what's it say?
the will?
as his lawyer , i can't tell you .
why?
why did you take the door away?
what do you mean , you can't tell me?
this is jason's place , mom .
this is not our apartment .
he wanted the will read after the funeral .
what funeral?
turner's letter deals with the funeral arrangements .
you got a letter?
and you got a letter .
i didn't get a letter .
you got a post it .
i got a post it .
is it cogent?
no .
actually , it's not cogent .
what's it say?
what does your letter say?
some of it was private .
what does the not private part say?
dear turner , this bag is to be opened at the kfc restaurant ... ... where we had our final meal as a family .
please bring the ashes with you .
also bring jason and zach .
i love you .
i'm sorry i'm dead . " signed , " henry .
they're not even ashes .
they're bones .
mom .
cremation?
as far as i know .
except ...
they're smashed up bones .
they should tell you that .
if you want to stay , you're gonna have to behave .
except what?
he wants to be with sky .
" with sky , " what?
cremated with him .
sky isn't dead .
well , maybe he wanted you to kill the dog .
he is old .
come on .
we gotta go .
don't worry .
we don't have to kill the dog .
we're not gonna kill the dog .
henry said he's gonna die today .
sky?
sky?
first off , i would like to welcome you all to my funeral .
i wish i was there with you .
please begin by taking out the bag ... ... that is inside the bag you were given .
okay .
let's see .
one , a pair of post its , one pink , one blue .
two , a map .
three , another bag .
the pink post it will tell you exactly where to make ... ... the first disposal of sky's and my remains .
the blue post it will detail the ritual to take place there .
the map will direct you to the kfc establishment where you are to dine .
oh , my god .
" open the next bag and so on ... ... until there is nothing left of me .
i love you all .
henry .
it's pretty clear , right?
we shouldn't do this .
i spoke to the people at the cemetery ... ... where henry already has a plot , next to your mother ... ... and they said they would be willing to intern henry and sky's remains in the plot .
ring , ring , ring ...
zach .
i need ...
yeah .
hello?
no .
barney , look , i'm in the ...
i can't talk to him right now .
hello , sir .
tell him you're in the middle of a funeral .
yeah .
tell him you're at a funeral at kfc .
which post it was the first one?
the pink , i think .
it's top priority , and i'm going to go see them .
zach , please .
he wants us to start at my mother's grave .
we aren't doing it .
now , just give me one second .
i think it's important too , sir .
can i , just , in two minutes ...
can i call you back?
turner .
i'll take care of it .
where is he going?
just wait here for me for a sec .
zach , i'm serious .
i want you just to stay here for two seconds , okay?
zach , i'm not kidding .
i need you just to stay here .
turner .
we are not doing this .
i didn't come here to deal with you .
well , now you have to !
now , you can't take ...
let's just go back inside and figure out something that works for everyone .
okay?
tell zach i'm glad i met him .
you too .
he wants you to know , mom , that he thinks about you every single day .
turner .
and that he ...
he's sorry about the change in plan .
ashes .
and he wanted to sing you a song .
oh , my god .
he wanted you to have this .
and this is from me .
turkey sandwich , extra mayo .
zach .
a little sky .
a little bit of sky .
jason .
come on .
come on .
come .
look , how long do you think this is gonna take?
what's the first stop?
death valley .
how about a lift so we can pack?
not necessary .
katrina has already packed you both .
you're kidding me , right?
where did you get this?
it was a gift .
someone gave you a brand new ... ... sterling silver spoon as a gift?
yep .
did you steal it?
sometimes a thing wants to be stolen .
that's right , zach .
it's true .
how can i help you?
oh , hello .
nice to see you .
how much is this spoon?
that's $ 199 . 50 .
it's lovely , isn't it?
we'd like to pay for it now .
i don't understand .
my father left here the other day without paying for it and we'd like to pay for it now .
but it was a gift .
from who?
from me .
you know him?
you know my father?
we have mutual friends .
tell him .
we're both in aa .
excuse me .
my name's marion .
i'm an alcoholic , we met at a meeting .
hi , marion .
he told me about his father .
i recently lost mine .
anyway , your father didn't have the money for the spoon we liked .
and i get a discount here , so i bought it for him .
you thought that was funny , didn't you?
kind of , yeah .
you did have a history of places like this .
i do .
yes .
just talk to him , barn .
look ...
what are you doing?
i'm collecting .
hey , grandpa turner?
yep .
why did you go away ... ... when my daddy was a little boy?
did he do something to make you mad?
no .
then why'd you go away?
well , what's it say?
turner .
there's a ranch near here .
it's where my mother lived when henry met her .
i can still remember her ... ... standing there in the barn ... ... the warm sunlight behind her .
so young , beautiful .
her small , firm breasts shining ...
he doesn't know what breasts are .
i know what breasts are .
titties .
this is ridiculous .
titties , he said titties .
no .
we don't get to look at the map until after the dispersal part of the ritual .
fine .
let's disperse .
come on , zach .
henry wanted us to share a meal before each spooning .
knock yourself out .
how far is the ranch?
i'm not hungry .
the meal thing is part of the ritual .
he did not say we have to eat chicken at every single stop ...
don't bitch to me .
i'm the vegetarian .
you thinking about a woman , zach?
yep .
jason , how about you?
yes .
who you thinking about?
did the post it say " think about a woman , " or " talk about thinking about a woman "?
tina turner .
tina .
that's hot .
so , what are you and tina doing?
you balling?
what's balling?
it's ...
zach , it's ...
it's playing catch .
you're playing catch with tina?
no .
no , we're singing .
singing?
what , you got a problem with that?
no , it's just not real sexy .
i didn't hear " sex fantasy , " i heard " think about a woman .
who you thinking about , zach?
alice , she lives next door .
she kissed me once .
she kissed you?
zach heard " sex fantasy .
who are you thinking about , grandpa?
louise pearce .
buck naked , in her mama's car .
maybe alice will play catch with me naked sometime ...
okay .
just blow the ashes .
henry wanted us to listen to it loud .
only kidding .
shit .
we'll come back in the morning .
i'll wake zach , we can open the bags now .
we can't do that .
why not?
henry wants us to open the bags inside .
he said at a kfc stand , not in a kfc stand .
literature calls them restaurants .
fine .
right .
and you don't eat at restaurants , you eat in restaurants .
you're kidding me , right?
no , i'm not .
okay , then how do you explain that?
do the cars eat their chicken in , or do they eat their chicken at?
i don't know .
either way , they eat their chicken .
we cannot , because we don't have any chicken .
and that's why we're not opening the bag out here .
excuse me .
excuse me .
hey .
we're closed .
yeah .
look , can i talk to you for a second?
the registers are closed .
we don't need the register .
look , i'll give you 100 bucks for three drumsticks .
i'm sorry .
i say we make an exception .
no .
look , we're just gonna skip one meal .
no !
why not?
the place doesn't open until 11 .
we're here .
let's get it over with .
what is the big deal?
the big deal , it's not what henry wanted .
you don't wanna be here , i'll take you back .
i didn't say i didn't wanna be here .
then act like it .
you think you're the only one whose life got interrupted by this .
i need this about as much as i need a bullet in my head .
i don't know about you , but henry never asked me to do a thing ... ... in his entire life , and he asked me to do this , and i'm doing it !
not your way or my way , but his way .
are we gonna stop or are we gonna sleep in the van?
i gotta pee .
but if you choose not to abide by henry's wishes as he wrote them ... ... then the will names turner as the sole beneficiary .
of what?
henry's things .
the collection is worth about $ 220, 000 .
hello?
you there?
who gets the things if we do this?
zach .
henry knew you wouldn't do anything to deprive zach of his inheritance .
i don't think that he ever cared much for you working in that bank .
it's about time .
you guys really love your chicken .
you have no idea , man .
hey , has anybody seen my phone?
damn it .
zach , you seen my phone?
no .
goddamn it .
you're kind of a tense person .
you get that from your mother's people , i think .
pull the van over .
turner , pull the van over .
i don't know what etiquette book you referenced before your homecoming ... ... but i don't think they advise insulting people you left behind .
when did i insult you?
you called me tense .
you called me thief .
you were a thief !
you were tense .
you still are .
okay .
fine .
maybe right now , at this point , i am tense .
that does not make me a tense person .
fair enough .
fair enough .
i was also a musician .
what?
i wasn't just a thief .
in case you wanna update your point of view .
yeah .
okay .
let's update my point of view .
let's update yours too .
what , are you kidding me?
you show up here after , what , 850 years and think you get to decide ... ... what we get to talk about .
fuck you , man .
fuck you .
we're not just gonna talk about the present .
so you can forget the part about walking out on your family?
i didn't forget .
this isn't the first thing henry's asked me to do .
he's asked me to do a million things and i've been happy to do them .
so you don't have the market cornered on helping henry .
there .
we updated?
hey , dad?
why did grandpa turner have to sleep someplace else last night?
who's that?
that's me .
i think that's my mom .
what's on the back of it?
my boy .
did you go on digs with him?
i wanted him to leave it all in the ground .
the pottery , the bones .
it didn't belong up here .
but ...
... my father loved ... ... digging up old shit .
oh , excuse me .
i'm looking for henry lair .
he's dead , so he can't come to the door .
dead .
i'm sorry .
actually , i'm looking for his son , turner .
why?
have we tried the extra crispy?
did we like it?
so how long will you be with us?
just the night .
stop .
oh , that's my grandpa henry .
he's dead .
i recently lost my ...
ruth .
for god's sake , ruth .
i should never have let her keep the thing .
it's her brother .
every time she looks at him , this happens .
his own children didn't want the damn thing .
why does she got to keep the ashes?
it's sick .
i didn't ...
are you ...?
you keeping yours?
no .
good for you .
i mean , dead bodies are not meant to be ... ... inside of people's houses .
it's sick .
the keys , please .
oh , yes .
of course .
have a good night .
good night .
you know , i remember that .
what's bullhead?
kind of like this weird shark fish thing .
really ugly .
on your way , huh?
yep .
listen , i wonder if you could do us a favor .
could you take this?
take it for what?
well , for , you know , scattering with ...
what's it for?
he's bringing the ashes .
is it okay with your wife?
it was her idea .
she , you know ...
ruth .
come here .
she just , you know , couldn't ask you herself .
we'd really appreciate it .
put him anywhere .
just get them out of here .
he wants us to take the ashes .
for?
you have a spoon?
a spoon?
maybe we should mix .
what?
never mind .
we've been mixing the dog's in .
the ashes are probably all mixed up together anyway .
i don't know .
it's not gonna matter .
okay .
take care .
bye .
you can't find them?
we have no reason to think ... ... turner's dangerous .
he broke out of prison and he has my son .
he didn't break out .
he walked out .
and i assure you we'll find them .
katrina , stop crying .
sorry .
are you going somewhere?
yeah , my work is done now .
i go home to rhus .
a woman who slept with a fugitive .
you slept with turner?
oh , dear .
well , it's okay .
jason said i'm allowed to have boyfriends .
he's ...
he's not a boyfriend .
he's jason's father .
so?
in denmark , people's fathers can be boyfriends too .
thanks .
where are we?
we're here , somewhere .
yeah .
right there .
zach , did henry tell you where we're going?
going to albuquerque?
owen , your dog's out in the back again .
goddamn it .
silver !
get over here !

where's zach?
what?
where's zach?
stay in the fucking truck !
tell your kid to stay away from my fucking dog .
what?
what are you looking at?
how much is he?
what?
your dog .
fuck you .
he ain't for sale .
i'd like to buy him anyway .
you ask me again , somebody else is gonna end up with your social security .
okay , turner , let's just go .
go !
you're stealing his dog?
i didn't steal it .
what do you mean , you didn't steal it?
traded for it .
traded for it with what?
silver !

it was pretty good .
anyway , that's where the bus was going .
wake up .
grandpa turner's dancing .
he's dancing .
grandpa , what are you doing?
dancing , zach .
what are you dancing for?
i'm dancing for you , zach .
why?
dancing .
for our tribe .
hey , look who's up .

go ahead .
you want me to do it?
sorry i couldn't tell you , grandpa turner .

zach , i don't know .
i don't know .
i wanna go home .
mom !
i missed you .
thank you for picking him up .
do you know where he is?
no .
he said he was headed somewhere down near mexico .
i guess he balled some girl there .
they have cartoons .
can i keep watching?
it's fine .
the fbi guy was impressed with him .
the doctor at prison told him turner should've been dead a week ago .
what?
oh , my god .
you don't know?
no .
i don't know .
what?
he walked out of a prison hospital during a blackout .
he was getting dialysis .
his kidneys stopped functioning six months ago .
he didn't tell you?
jesus , turner .
what are you doing here?
what is this place?
wasn't like this .
we lived here after your mother died .
why did henry send us here?
spite .
henry's last wish .
spite .
i thought it was for us .
so we could know each other again ... ... but he just wanted to dig up shit one last time .
why?
what happened here?
i'm not doing this .
i was a junkie when i lived here .
turner , what happened here?
i'm dead .
i'm not even that person anymore .
ancient stuff .
you did something here , didn't you?
she was my breath .
when she died ... ... i had no breath anymore .
you understand?
henry didn't send us here for spite .
you bet your ass he did .
he did it so i could forgive you .
all my post it said was " forgive him .
what am i forgiving you for , turner?
what am i forgiving you for?
what happened here ...
what?
there's no forgiveness .
what happened on the stairway , turner?
just tell me .
what happened on the stairway?
you were not in the car .
what?
with your mother .
you were never in a car accident .
what'd you do?
did you ...
did you drop me?
did you get fucked up?
fucked up?
you got fucked up and you dropped me?
i was gone !
just say it .
