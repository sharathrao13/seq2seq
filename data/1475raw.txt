<i>there are so many show offs in journalism . </ i>
<i>so many braggarts and jerks . </ i>
<i>they are always selling , always working the room, </ i> <i>always trying to make themselves look hotter than they actually are . </ i>
<i>the good news is, </ i> <i>reporters like that make it easy to distinguish yourself . </ i>
<i>if you're even a little bit humble, </ i> <i>a little self effacing or solicitous , you stand out . </ i>
<i>so you bring a co worker lunch if he's buried under a deadline, </ i> <i>you remember birthdays . </ i>
<i>it's true , journalism is hard work, </ i> <i>everybody's under pressure , everybody's grinding to get the issue out . </ i>
<i>nobody's getting any sleep , but you are allowed to smile every once in a while . </ i>
<i>i mean , even woodward and bernstein went out for a burger now and then, </ i> <i>and they won a pulitzer . </ i>
<i>some reporters think it's political content</ i> <i>that makes a story memorable . </ i>
<i>i think it's the people you find ... </ i> <i>their quirks , their flaws, </ i> <i>what makes them funny , what makes them human . </ i>
<i>journalism is just the art of capturing behavior . </ i>
<i>you have to know who you're writing for . </ i>
<i>and you have to know what you're good at . </ i>
<i>i record what people do, </ i>
<i>i find out what moves them , what scares them, </ i> <i>and i write that down . </ i>
<i>that way , they are the ones telling the story . </ i>
<i>you know what?
those kind of pieces can win pulitzers too . </ i>

<i>sorry if i'm beaming , but , you know , i was his journalistic muse . </ i>
<i>it's true . </ i>
<i>just seven years ago , he was sitting ... </ i> <i>right there . </ i>
<i>i'm sorry .
right there . </ i>
<i>and i was doing the exact same thing you guys are doing ... </ i> <i>grinding out pieces and then having horrid nightmares</ i> <i>of mrs. duke and her infamous red pen . </ i>
<i>and see what happens when greatness is demanded of you? </ i>
<i>now he's at the new republic . </ i>
<i>and now i'm at the new republic . </ i>
<i>in may , the editors of the new republic magazine ... </ i> <i> ... with the washington post , the new republic , and the boston globe . </ i>

<i>it's the fundamental nature of the magazine , lew . </ i>
<i> mallory , can i get some copies?
sure . </ i>
<i>people want photographs , they can buy newsweek . </ i>
<i>they do buy newsweek .
and time, </ i> <i>and us news & world report .
and our losses are a joke . </ i>
<i>let me guess .
he's on you again about a redesign . </ i>
<i> yeah , cover page and graphics .
and photographs . </ i>
<i>let me remind you steve, </ i> this magazine hasn't changed its look since the '80s .
how is it?
it's good .
<i> you hate it .
no , it's good , it's a little rough . </ i>
<i>no , it's the worst thing i ever wrote .
it's horrible . </ i>
if you guys don't help me with it , i'm not even going to send it in .
<i> when is it due?
tomorrow . </ i>
tsk ...
i may have to kill myself .
<i>i mean , the new york times magazine ! </ i>
will you guys help me with it , please?
<i> of course .
of course . </ i>
thank you .
<i>call for you on three , sweetie ... someone from policy review . </ i>
<i>when did you start talking to policy review? </ i>
<i>i'm not .
it's probably nothing .
send it to my voicemail , okay? </ i>
oh , and sweetie ...?
mm hmm?
<i>caitlin just told me that she needs gifts for ... two showers next week? </ i>
<i>you think you might have something for her? </ i>

<i>the lawyers have asked us to tone down the cover on serbia . </ i>
<i> they have?
it might invite charges of libel . </ i>
i know a little bit of libel law , <i>it's only relevant if the person in question has been out of the public eye . </ i>
<i>well , yes .
so there is serbia , hidden, </ i> <i>unknown to the world at large , until ... </ i> <i>it appeared on the cover of the new republic . </ i>
<i>our weekly circulation of 80, 000 . </ i>
81 . 5 .
you almost done with it , rob?
<i> two days .

yes , two days from chanukah . </ i>

<i>there are 16, 800 magazines in this country . </ i>
<i>but only one calls itself " the in flight magazine of air force one . " </ i>
<i>and that's the thrill of working at the new republic . </ i>
<i>you're underpaid , the hours are brutal, </ i> <i>but what you write gets read by people who matter . </ i>
<i>presidents , lawmakers ... your work can actually influence public policy . </ i>
<i>that's ... that's an amazing privilege, </ i> <i>and a huge responsibility . </ i>
<i>i'm sorry .
they don't want to hear</ i> <i>the whole " journalistic responsibility " speech ... do you? </ i>
<i>you just want to know how to get your name in print , right? </ i>
<i>that sounds familiar .
okay . </ i>
<i>let me take you through the life of your typical piece</ i> <i>so you can see what some of the hurdles are . </ i>
<i>we'll use one i wrote last year, </ i> <i>about a bunch of young republicans at a conservatives 'convention . </ i>
<i>now , journalism is about pursuing the truth . </ i>
<i>and i would never encourage you to do anything sneaky or dishonest</ i> <i>in pursuit of a story , such as assuming a phony identity . </ i>
<i>i don't know , man .
it seemed like a pretty good turnout to me . </ i>
<i>no , man .
conservatism is dead . </ i>
<i> dead?
we're lost . </ i>
<i>damn straight . </ i>
<i>on a story like that , your notes are crucial . </ i>
<i>you have to record everything you see and hear . </ i>
<i>every quote , every detail ... </ i> <i>all the way down to the mini bottles in the fridge . </ i>
<i>we're like this guy who has to pee, </ i>
<i>lost in the desert , looking for a tree . </ i>
<i>that's true .
completely true . </ i>
<i>you guys know what you're shopping for , right? </ i>
yeah , totally .
<i>get us a real " heifer .
the fatter the better . </ i>
bad acne would be a bonus .
<i>let's do it ! </ i>
hey , steve .
hey , chuck .
<i>what are you working on? </ i>
<i>a piece gabriel garca marquez wrote about the falklands war . </ i>
<i>how about you? </ i>
<i>young republicans at a cpac conference . </ i>
<i>pretty standard stuff . </ i>
<i>hotel ballrooms , boring speeches .
chicken dinners . </ i>
<i>which is why everybody spends their time in the suites upstairs</ i> committing felonies .
oh , yeah?
<i>yeah .
i went to one .
the ballroom was empty . </ i>
<i>every delegate under the age of 25 was on the fifth floor getting loaded . </ i>
<i>drugs , binge drinking , hookers ... </ i> <i>it gets pretty ugly . </ i>
<i> sounds great , steve .
so does yours . </ i>
<i>okay , well , i gotta get back to work .
have a good lunch . </ i>
thanks .
<i>hold it .
have to give myself a demerit for poor scene setting . </ i>
<i>let me explain .
a year ago , chuck lane and i were peers . </ i>
<i>he hadn't become editor yet . </ i>
michael kelly was editing the magazine then .
<i>sorry , mrs. duke .
i know how you feel about clarity . </ i>
<i>we've got to start calling some other places . </ i>
<i>i don't think i can eat this stuff every day . </ i>
it was the cannon building .
you had it as " russell .
i fixed it .
<i> thank you .
i really liked it , ames . </ i>
<i>but boring , right? </ i>
<i>no .
no .
i really , really liked it . </ i>
<i> ahem ...
yes , dear? </ i>
<i>somebody for you on three ... someone from harper's . </ i>
<i>when did you start talking to harper's? </ i>
<i>i'm not .
it's probably nothing .
could you send it to my voicemail? </ i>
<i> very good .
by the way , glo ', </ i> that lipstick is the bomb .
thanks , doll .
was it " midnight mist "?
<i> i've really got to stop doing that .
what? </ i>
<i>all i do is give people more reasons to assume i'm gay . </ i>
<i>i mean , lately , it's everyone . </ i>
<i>the other night , i went out to dinner with this guy from the post ... </ i>
<i> who?
i can't tell you , he made me promise . </ i>
<i>anyway , we're walking afterwards , talking about medicare for god's sakes, </ i> <i>the next thing i know is we're standing on the corner of 18th and " t " ... </ i> <i>and he somehow managed to slip his tongue down my throat . </ i>
and i'm like , " wait a minute , how'd this happen?
<i>i don't understand .
neither did i. </ i>
hey !
michael .
<i> do you have a minute?
of course . </ i>
<i>we have a problem with the " spring breakdown " piece . </ i>
<i>just got a letter from david keene .
he ran the cpac conference . </ i>
<i> he's made ...
are you mad at me? </ i>
<i>he's made some pretty serious charges .
we need to answer them . </ i>
<i>okay .
my notes are at home . </ i>
i can be back in 20 minutes .
is that too long?
<i>do your notes have anything about the minibars?
that would help . </ i>
<i>i think so .
no , i'm sure .
why? </ i>
<i>he claims the omni shoreham doesn't even have minibars . </ i>
he mentioned it specifically .
no , i saw them .
<i>there were little bottles of booze all over the room . </ i>
<i>okay .
i'll get aaron and rob into it, </ i> <i>and start the fact check again . </ i>
i'll get my notes .
thank you .
<i>i'm sorry , we're gonna have to finish this later . </ i>
<i>no , no .
i understand .
thank you . </ i>
<i>what's wrong? </ i>
just tell me .
<i>keene was right , michael . </ i>
i messed up .
<i>i made a huge error . </ i>
<i>i don't know what to say .
if you want me to resign , i will . </ i>
i want you to tell me what happened .
<i>they don't have minibars at the omni shoreham hotel . </ i>
i guess i just saw all those little bottles and i made an assumption , <i>which i know we're never supposed to do . </ i>
<i>i'm really sorry . </ i>
<i>those guys were drinking out of a rented refrigerator . </ i>
<i>a mini fridge . </ i>
that's it?
yeah .
<i> the rest of the piece is solid?
well , yeah , of course . </ i>
<i>go home , steve .
your resignation will not be required . </ i>
<i> really?
you're not mad?
of course not . </ i>
do you want my notes?
have a good night .
thanks , michael .
<i>thanks for backing me . </ i>
<i>it's what editors do . </ i>
<i>good night . </ i>
<i>hi , front desk , please? </ i>
<i>hi , i need some information . </ i>
<i>do the suites of your hotel have minibars? </ i>
<i>well , can a guest rent something like that ... </ i>
<i>like a mini refrigerator or something? </ i>
<i>they can?
okay , thank you very much . </ i>
<i>and she says , " i didn't invite vernon jordan that evening, </ i> <i>because my guests of honor were girls from smith college . </ i>
<i>some of them were virgins , and i wanted to keep it that way . " </ i>
<i>and you are going to put that in the article , right? </ i>
gosh , alec , i don't know .
<i>i mean , george is such a dignified publication . </ i>
you wouldn't want to put in something that gossipy , would you?
no , absolutely not .
<i>of course i'm putting it in . </ i>
<i>thank you steve .
you are going to make me look very , very smart . </ i>
<i>er , the fritos are running dangerously low . </ i>
<i>i'll be right back . </ i>
<i>can't hide in here all night , ames . </ i>
can i ask you something?
what is this?
<i>i found it in the freezer . </ i>
<i>you said you hated how the diet coke at parties</ i> <i>was always at room temperature .
and if you wanted to drink it cold, </ i> <i>you'd have to put it on ice and it would get too watery .
don't you remember? </ i>
yeah , i do , but ...
<i>i said that a couple of years ago . </ i>
<i>steve? </ i>
<i>i'm going to call it a night , but thanks for having me . </ i>
<i>thanks for coming . </ i>
<i>alphabetized beer , that's perfect . </ i>
<i> drive safe , alec .
who's he? </ i>
<i>associate editor of george . </ i>
<i>when did you start talking to george? </ i>
<i>i'm really not . </ i>
<i>it's probably nothing . </ i>
<i>you know , if they stoop any lower, </ i> <i>you won't be able to tell the difference between time and people . </ i>
<i>you say that as if there is a difference between time and people . </ i>
exactly .
hey !
thank you , steve .
what?
<i>are you mad at me? </ i>
<i>i told you , i do not respond to " are you mad at me? " </ i>
<i>i'm not your kindergarten teacher . </ i>
<i>i thought we'd been over this a thousand times already . </ i>
you can't go to law school .
<i>you " don't want to go to law school , " remember? </ i>
<i>i know .
it's only nights .
i wouldn't have to stop working . </ i>
<i>i'm going to put these down .
i'll be right back . </ i>
no , i want to talk about this .
<i>i told you , it's my parents .
okay? </ i>
<i>they never shut up about it . </ i>
<i>if i don't go , they won't let me be a journalist anymore . </ i>
<i>" let you "?
you're 24 years old , stephen ! </ i>
<i>you don't know how things go where i grew up , caitlin . </ i>
<i>there are rules there . </ i>
<i>if your son's not a doctor or a lawyer , you keep your curtains closed . </ i>
<i>you're writing for the new fucking republic . </ i>
isn't that good enough?
<i>not in highland park . </ i>
<i> i'm sorry , i ...
stop apologizing for everything ! </ i>
<i>i was looking through your mail .
you should be pissed at me . </ i>
i'm not .
<i>you're going to throw this out , right? </ i>
<i>i can't .
i'm sorry . </ i>
<i>every station on the radio was talking about it ... </ i>
<i>mike tyson biting evander holyfield . </ i>
<i>and these are supposed to be news stations, </ i> <i>so on tuesday i started calling a few of them, </ i> <i>and i finally got through to one . </ i>
a bible talk station in kentucky .
<i>and i managed to convince the screener</ i> <i>that i was a behavioral psychologist</ i> who " specializes in human on human biting .
<i>i told the guy that i'd done all this extensive research</ i> <i>on people who chomp flesh under extreme stress ... </ i>
and what did they say?
<i>they put me on the air , i took calls for 45 minutes . </ i>
oh , my god !
<i>where does he find these people? </ i>
it's kind of stupid , i know .
it's silly .
<i>i'll probably just kill it . </ i>
does that mean you'll help me with it?
why?
do you have finals this week?
<i>okay , moving right along . </ i>
<i>chuck , what do you have for us? </ i>
<i>that's a bit of a hard act to follow . </ i>
<i>very hard act to follow . </ i>
okay .
<i>i'm starting the piece on haiti, </ i> and i'll be going to ...
<i>hey .
don't let me interrupt . </ i>
<i> hey , marty .
michael . </ i>
<i>i'm going to be going to port au prince for a few days . </ i>
uh huh .
<i>marty peretz , our boss , he's a little scary . </ i>
<i>how about the commas and dates?
are we supposed to circle those too? </ i>
let's just get this done , okay?
what the hell is this?
<i>marty told us to circle all the commas in the last issue, </ i> <i>so he could show us how we used them improperly . </ i>
what?
<i>he said , " commas should always appear in pairs . " </ i>
<i>apparently the issue was rife with comma errors . </ i>
" rife "?
that's what he said .
i see .
<i>no , i'm not angry , marty .
i'm embarrassed for you . </ i>
<i>these people work grueling hours for meager pay . </ i>
<i>they deserve a thank you, </ i> <i>not another one of your world famous tantrums . </ i>
<i>yeah , okay .
i'd resign before i'd let you bully them like that again . </ i>
<i>and i will .
do you understand that? </ i>
<i>okay .
thank you . </ i>
<i>" the great comma debate " is history, </ i> <i>so we can all go back to work . </ i>
<i>there are good editors , there are bad editors . </ i>
you'll have both .
<i>my hope for you though is that once, </ i> <i>at least once you get a truly great one . </ i>
<i>a great editor defends his writers ... </ i> <i>against anyone .
he stands up , and fights for you . </ i>
<i>michael kelly was that kind of editor . </ i>
<i>he had that kind of courage . </ i>
and that's what hung him .
hello .
<i>hey , chuck , it's marty peretz .
you got a minute? </ i>
<i>of course , how are you , marty? </ i>
<i>i'm in a bit of an uncomfortable situation . </ i>
<i>i thought you might be able to help me out . </ i>
<i> sure .
it's about mike . </ i>
<i> oh .
he and i ... </ i> <i>well , it hasn't been working out for some time now , as you know . </ i>
<i>the tone of the magazine i think it's ... gotten too nasty ! </ i>
<i>it's strayed from the traditions that make it great . </ i>
<i>and ...
i'm going to be making a change . </ i>
i see .
<i>i'd like you to step in for him , chuck .
i'd like you to become editor . </ i>
<i>editor? </ i>
<i>there's a catch , of course .
mike doesn't know any of this yet, </ i> <i>and it's gonna be two or three days before i tell him . </ i>
<i>it'll have to remain between us until then .
would that be a problem? </ i>
<i> marty , mike's a friend .
i appreciate that , chuck . </ i>
<i>but i can't remove him until i know who is going to be his replacement</ i> <i>for continuity's sake .
so this is how it has to be . </ i>
i'm gonna have to think about this .
<i>i'm gonna have to discuss it with caterina . </ i>
<i>of course , of course !
listen ... </ i>
<i>marty , have you thought about the impact this might have on the staff? </ i>
<i>they feel very ... </ i> <i>he's earned a lot of loyalty there . </ i>
<i>yes , mostly by fighting with me . </ i>
<i>the point is , i haven't earned that kind of loyalty .
if it looks like ... </ i>
<i>i'll be there tomorrow .
we'll go over all this in detail . </ i>
<i> will you call me at the hotel?
yeah . </ i>
<i>i really appreciate this , chuck ... your discretion . </ i>
<i> good night .
'night , marty . </ i>
<i>so , i just got off the phone with marty, </ i> <i>and i've been fired , effective immediately . </ i>
<i>i'm to be out of the building by 5 : 00 p . m . </ i>
<i>chuck lane has been chosen to replace me . </ i>
<i>chuck is not an editor . </ i>
<i>he's barely even a writer . </ i>
<i>there's no way i'm gonna be able to work for him . </ i>
<i>we should've seen this coming ... </ i> <i>the way he laughs whenever marty tells a joke in the meetings . </ i>
<i>they're never funny , but there's chuck completely howling .
he's so political . </ i>
<i>and stiff , and humorless . </ i>
and pissy .
i mean , how pissy does he get <i>whenever you try to fact check one of his pieces? </ i>
<i>it's like i'm sorry , but we have an obligation to get our facts straight . </ i>
<i>okay , let's not overdo it . </ i>
<i>this is still a great magazine , it's still an important magazine . </ i>
<i>and ...
monday morning he's going to be running it . </ i>
<i>i'm going to barf . </ i>
<i>all right .
let me get out of here , okay? </ i>
<i>well , i just want to thank you all again .
truly . </ i>
<i>i've loved every second of this . </ i>
good luck , mike .
you too , chuck .
hi .
hi .
hi .
so ... <i>sorry about what happened when he left . </ i>
i just didn't know what to do .
thanks .
if you need a hand with the boxes , i'll be in my office .
<i>so chuck took over, </ i> <i>and the job , for the first time ever, </ i> <i>began to feel like a job . </ i>
<i>but i'm being unfair . </ i>
<i>the truth is , i wrote 14 pieces while chuck was editing the magazine . </ i>
<i>and the last of them, </ i> <i>was the biggest story i ever wrote . </ i>
<i>is anyone interested in hackers? </ i>
because i met this kid named ian restil .
<i>biggest computer geek of all time . </ i>
<i>he hacked his way into the database of a company called jukt micronics, </ i> <i>and posted naked pictures of women</ i> <i>and the salary of every jukt employee on jukt's website with a note</ i> <i>saying , " the big bad bionic boy has been here , baby ! " </ i>
outstanding .
<i>the guys at jukt decided that it would be cheaper to hire him</ i> <i>as security consultant than it would be to try to stop him, </ i> so they met with him last week at the hotel <i>where the national hackers 'conference was taking place . </ i>
<i>it was the chairman from jukt, </ i>
<i>restil , restil's mother and restil's agent . </ i>
no ... !
<i>yes , hackers have agents too . </ i>
<i>all right , i was at the table with these guys . </ i>
<i>restil's just laying out all of his demands . </ i>
<i> i want a miata ...
" i want a trip to disney world . " </ i>
i want " x men " comic book no .
1 . <i> " ... a lifetime subscription to playboy .
and throw in penthouse . </ i>
<i>and they're complying with every single word . </ i>
<i>excuse me sir , pardon me for interrupting . </ i>
<i>we can arrange more money and you can buy the comic yourself . </ i>
<i>and when you're of a more appropriate age, </ i> <i>you can buy the car</ i> <i>and pornographic magazines on your own . </ i>
cool .
<i>after that , after they have the meeting, </ i> <i>he goes back into the conference , where all these hackers have gathered, </ i> <i>and they're treating him like he's a rock star . </ i>
<i>then , restil jumps up on a table , and he's like ... </ i>
i want a miata !
<i>and he's gyrating his hips like this .
i want a miata ! </ i>
<i>i want my playboys !
i want a trip to disney world ! " </ i>
show me the money !
show me the money !
<i>turns out there are now 21 states</ i> <i>considering versions of a law</ i> <i>called the " uniform computer security act , " </ i> <i>which would criminalize immunity deals</ i> <i>between hackers and the companies they've torched . </ i>
<i>meanwhile , restil's agent claims a client list of over 300, </ i> <i>one of whom was once paid a million dollars ... </ i> <i>and a monster truck . </ i>
that's unbelievable .
<i>it's really silly , i know . </ i>
<i>i'm not even sure if i'm going to finish it . </ i>
shit .
<i>you rang? </ i>
<i>yes , i rang . </ i>
why didn't you get this?
yeah .
oh , that ...
i don't know .
hey .
hey .
<i>is it pronounced " jooked " or " jucked "? </ i>
<i>it's pronounced , " give me back my article . " </ i>
adam ... !
can you give a man a minute?
<i>oh , yeah .
i'm sorry . </ i>
<i>er , it's just that ... </ i> <i>this new republic piece is a fucking sieve . </ i>
<i>i started with a check on " jukt micronics , " </ i> <i>which is supposed to be this major software company in california . </ i>
<i>i went through every search engine on the web ... no matches found . </ i>
<i>so i called 411 every area code in the state . </ i>
<i>there's no listing anywhere for a company called " jukt micronics . " </ i>
<i>tried the california tax franchise board, </ i> <i>there's no record of taxes ever having been paid</ i> <i>by a company called jukt micronics . </ i>
<i>tried the state comptroller's office, </ i> <i>no license has ever been applied for by a company using that name . </ i>
<i>then i called all the hackers i know, </ i> <i>asking if any had heard of a " national assembly of hackers , " </ i> <i>or a hacker by the name of " big bad bionic boy . " </ i>
<i>nothing .
i even tried ian restil himself . </ i>
<i>there's no listing for the kid in d. c. , virginia , maryland . </ i>
<i>there's no record of him ever having attended a public school before . </ i>
<i> more?
please . </ i>
<i>this guy joe hiert was described in the glass piece</ i> <i>as being this a former basketball agent, </ i> <i>yet no one by that name has ever been registered with the nba</ i> <i>and none of my hackers knew of him . </ i>
<i>i even checked the names of every government ... </ i>
i was just getting some coffee .
<i>i checked the names of every government employee quoted in the piece, </ i> <i>against a book listing the names of every government employee</ i> <i>in the entire united states .
none of the glass sources were listed . </ i>
<i>but there is one thing in this story that checks out . </ i>
what's that?
<i>there does appear to be a state in the union named nevada . </ i>
david .
<i> for christ's sakes .
god , i'm sorry , stephen . </ i>
<i>i wanted to see if you read it yet .
it was sitting right here , you know? </ i>
don't hate me , okay?
<i>stephen , you shredded it . </ i>
<i>i'm trying to spare you a spanking , david . </ i>
<i>you've got blind quotes all over the place . </ i>

<i>this is the new republic , remember? </ i>

thanks , stephen .
<i>" you have one unheard message .
first message . " </ i>
<i>hi , stephen , this is adam penenberg , from forbes digital tool . </ i>
<i>i just got done reading your hacker article . </ i>
<i>first of all , congratulations . </ i>
<i>i mean , everybody here just loved it . </ i>
<i>but we wanted to do a companion piece to it, </ i> <i>sort of a " day two " story ... </ i> <i>and i'm having some trouble tracking down ian restil . </ i>
<i>do you think i could get a phone number on him from you? </ i>
<i>look , i think it's good that you tried this . </ i>
<i>it's good to stretch .
i just ... </ i>
<i>i don't think you're writing to your strengths here . </ i>
i mean ...
can i?
<i>i'm wondering why you'd want to stray from the things you do so well? </ i>
have you noticed the way
<i>steve's phone has been ringing lately? </ i>
<i>did you see all those editors at the correspondents 'dinner? </ i>
<i> the way they were circling him?
is that what you want , amy? </ i>
<i>to get a bunch of smoke blown up your ass by a pack of editors? </ i>
yes .
yes , it is .
<i>caitlin , he's going to double his salary</ i> <i>freelancing like that . </ i>
<i>these guys don't want policy pieces anymore . </ i>
<i>they want color , they want nuance , humor . </ i>
<i>but amy , you don't write funny . </ i>
it's a little funny ... isn't it?
<i> i was just looking for steve .
he's in his office . </ i>
you got a minute , steve?
yeah .
<i>do you have phone numbers for sources on the " hack heaven " piece? </ i>
<i> mm hm , but they're at home .
can i get them? </ i>
<i>of course .
did i do something wrong?
are you mad at me? </ i>
<i>no , i just need the phone numbers . </ i>
okay .
<i>okay .
okay , i'm trying to keep cool about all this , but ... </ i> <i>you know the " uniform computer security act , " in the glass piece? </ i>
<i>supposed to be under debate in 21 state legislatures? </ i>
i just checked off 50 ... no such act .
beautiful .
<i>and julie farthwork , from the " computer security center "? </ i>
<i>not too sure she exists either . </ i>
<i>same with jim ghort of the " center for interstate online investigations . " </ i>
<i>and i've got nothing</ i> <i>on the " national assembly of hackers , " or " frank juliet . " </ i>
man !
<i>do you know why this is so great?
i mean , do you see the irony here? </ i>
<i>the new republic , snobbiest rag in the business ... </ i>
<i>" the in flight magazine of air force one " ... </ i> <i>and their star goes out and gets completely snowed by a bunch of hackers . </ i>
<i>i mean , god couldn't have written this any better . </ i>
<i> adam?
yeah? </ i>
<i>as long as i'm grinding away on this thing, </ i> <i>any chance you'd share your byline with me? </ i>
<i>forget it . </ i>
<i>we're in uncharted territory here , adam ... </ i> <i>an online magazine going after a giant . </ i>
you should have somebody beside you to take some of the flak in case this thing blows up .
<i> gosh , that's touching .
you're completely swamped . </ i>
<i>you're behind on the kim polese piece .
i know it's due friday . </ i>
i'll get to it .
<i>everything that i'm working on is so ... dull, </ i> <i>and this is spectacular . </ i>
andy ... no .
<i>it's not like you found the story yourself .
kambiz handed it to you . </ i>
<i>if i hadn't been at the dentist , it might be me about to get famous . </ i>
<i>so why don't you just ... share the wealth , okay?
shit ! </ i>
<i>that came out a lot uglier than i meant it .
sorry . </ i>
<i> hey .
hey . </ i>
<i>well , ian restil e mailed me right back . </ i>
<i>it might be tough to put you in touch with him directly , though, </ i> <i>or at least until next week .
this is his e mail : </ i>
<i>" your story screwed up my deal , i don't to talk to y ... " </ i>
i think he meant ...
" i don't want to talk to you .
<i>yeah .
i'm on vacation with my parents , so leave me alone . " </ i>
<i>what kind of parent goes on vacation with their kid in early may? </ i>
that's a good question .
<i>i guess you have to know his mom .
she's a little quirky . </ i>
<i>that's his e mail address , if you want to write him yourself . </ i>
<i>these are all my notes . </ i>
<i>that's the number for the national assembly of hackers . </ i>
<i>don't be thrown if all you hear is a dark , deep , heavy breathing . </ i>
<i>it's ...
i don't know , their outgoing voicemail message . </ i>
don't ask me why .
<i>and then that's the number for jukt micronics . </ i>
<i>the chairman's name is george sims . </ i>
<i>i can't figure why this penenberg guy would have such hard time finding it, </ i> <i>but you know , whatever . </ i>
<i>that's the url to their website . </ i>
<i>and then , i can't seem to find joe hiert's number . </ i>
<i>i was looking all over at home .
it's somewhere there .
i know it is . </ i>
<i>i'll get that to you tomorrow , if that's okay . </ i>
<i> sure .
yeah . </ i>
he's restil's agent .
<i>should i ...
i'll give you some privacy . </ i>
no .
have a seat .
650 , " is that palo alto?
<i>er , no , silicon valley . </ i>
<i>you'll probably get a voicemail .
i usually do . </ i>
<i>" you've reached the offices of jukt micronics . </ i>
<i>please leave a message . " </ i>
<i>this is charles lane , i'm calling from the new republic magazine</ i> <i>in washington d. c. , i'd like to speak to george sims , if i could . </ i>
<i>they already have our number . </ i>
<i>i guess you already have our number .
thank you . </ i>
<i>i'm sorry .
we've just like spoken a million times now . </ i>
<i>that's actually his voice on the answering machine . </ i>
sims is so hands on , <i>he won't even let his secretary do an outgoing message . </ i>
who's next?
<i>er , penenberg . </ i>
oh .
<i>this is adam . </ i>
hi , it's chuck lane .
hi , chuck .

<i>am i speaking with charles lane? </ i>
<i>mr .
sims , thank you for calling me back . </ i>
<i>i don't have time for this actually .
we're trying to have an office party . </ i>
uh huh .
<i>look , if you were calling for a comment on your story, </ i>
<i>i don't have one, </ i> <i>other than to say , i wish you'd never run the stupid thing . </ i>
<i>that stuff was supposed to be off the record, </ i> <i>and your reporter knows it , that glass guy . </ i>
<i> i'm calling to verify information .
i'm not verifying anything . </ i>
<i>bottom line is , i'd like you guys to basically get lost , okay? </ i>
<i>hello? </ i>
<i> hey .
david . </ i>
<i> i'm sorry , steve .
shit . </ i>
<i>i didn't mean to startle you .
i thought you'd like a cup of coffee . </ i>
<i> what are you doing here?
working late . </ i>
<i>working on my article , so i don't get shredded again . </ i>
<i> thank you .
you're welcome . </ i>
<i>i always forget to ask you .
how are your studies coming? </ i>
<i>their fine .
i'm ... just buried . </ i>
<i>you're buried .
right . </ i>
<i>okay .
i should probably let you get back to it . </ i>
<i> is there anything you need?
no .
good night , david . </ i>
good night .
thanks , steve .
<i>i got it . </ i>
hello?
chuck?
it's steve .
hi , steve .
<i>sorry to be calling so late . </ i>
<i>i was just wondering ... </ i> <i>did you get a call from the jukt guy?
george sims? </ i>
<i> i did , yeah .
yeah .
i was just sitting here, </ i> <i>and i realized that i'd given him your home number</ i> <i>without asking you first .
and i wanted to apologize . </ i>
<i> it's fine .
sort of a prick , didn't you think? </ i>
<i>i couldn't really tell because he hung up so fast . </ i>
<i> are you at home , steve?
no .
why? </ i>
<i>i left a message on your machine . </ i>
<i>those forbes guys want to talk to us again . </ i>
<i>there's a conference call at 9 : 00 a . m . </ i>
<i>sure .
sounds like a party . </ i>
yeah?
<i> okay , night , chuck .
see you in the morning . </ i>
<i>that's weird . </ i>
<i>morning . </ i>
hey .
<i> want a laugh?
sure . </ i>
<i> the website for jukt micronics .
oh , good . </ i>
yeah , you might not think so when you see what's on it .
<i>i don't think mr. sims liked our piece that much . </ i>
<i>yeah .
and i found this too , from my fridge for some reason . </ i>
<i>lan restil's agent , joe hiert . </ i>
<i>i'd like to pause for a moment . </ i>
<i>you can't go into the world of journalism without first understanding</ i> how a piece gets edited at a place like " tnr .
<i>this is a system that michael kelly brought with him from the new yorker . </ i>
<i>a three day torture test . </ i>
<i>if your article's good , the process will only make it better . </ i>
<i>if your article's shaky , you're in for a long week . </ i>
<i>a story comes in , and it goes to a senior editor . </ i>
<i>he , or she , edits it on computer, </ i> <i>then calls in the writer , who makes revisions . </ i>
<i>then the piece goes to a second editor , and the writer revises it again . </ i>
<i>then it goes through a fact check , where every fact in the piece ... </ i> <i>every date , every title, </ i> <i>every place or assertion is checked and verified . </ i>
<i>then the piece goes to a copy editor , where it is scrutinized once again . </ i>
<i>then it goes to lawyers , who apply their own burdens of proof . </ i>
<i>marty looks at it too .
he's very concerned with any kind of comment</ i> <i>the magazine is making . </ i>
<i>then production takes it , and lays it out into column inches and type . </ i>
<i>then it goes back on paper , then back to the writer, </ i> <i>back to the copy editor , back to editor number one, </ i> <i>and editor number two , back to the fact checker , back to the writer, </ i> <i>and back to production again . </ i>
<i>throughout , those lawyers are reading and re reading, </ i>
<i>looking for red flags , anything that feels uncorroborated . </ i>
<i>once they're satisfied , the pages are reprinted and it all happens again . </ i>
<i>every editor , the fact checkers ... they all go through it one last time . </ i>
<i>now , most of you will start out as interns somewhere . </ i>
<i>and interns do a lot of fact checking , so pay close attention . </ i>
<i>there's a hole in the fact checking system . </ i>
a big one .
<i>the facts in most pieces can be checked against some type of source material . </ i>
<i>if an article's on , say , ethanol subsidies, </ i> <i>you could check for discrepancies against the congressional record, </ i> <i>trade publications , lexisnexis, </ i> <i>and footage from c span . </ i>
<i>but on other pieces, </ i> <i>the only source material available</ i> <i>are the notes provided by the reporter himself . </ i>
steve?
<i>this doesn't look like a real business card to me . </ i>
yeah , i know .
that's the kind of clown this guy is .
<i>he won't even pay to have real cards made . </ i>
<i>all right . </ i>
my office at 9 : 00 , okay?
yeah .
<i>good morning . </ i>
<i>a few other people we can't seem to locate ... </ i>
<i>julie farthwork , frank juliet</ i> <i>and ian restil's agent , joe hiert . </ i>
<i>we called the numbers you gave us , got voicemails for all three . </ i>
<i>and the e mails were sent back " no address " or " account closed . " </ i>
really?
'cause i've e mailed them about a million times each .
<i>hiert's online all day long . </ i>
<i>did you call these people and get them directly? </ i>
no , i always left messages and spoke to them when they called me back .
<i>and the references in the article to nevada law enforcement officials . </ i>
<i>was jim ghort the only one you spoke to? </ i>
<i> yes .
do you have a number for him? </ i>
<i> yeah , definitely .
by the way , what was your basis</ i> <i>for writing that jukt was a big time software company? </ i>
<i>i didn't .
that was added by the copy desk , or during editorial . </ i>
<i>was the hackers 'conference where you met the jukt executives ... </ i>
<i>that part of the article is misleading . </ i>
<i>i was never in the restils 'home at all . </ i>
<i>you weren't in restil's home , with the jukt executives? </ i>
no , i didn't mean to imply that i had been .
<i>sorry about that .
did the fax come through okay? </ i>
yes , it did .
<i>i think the address must've gotten garbled .
we can't find the site . </ i>
<i> you want to read it back to me?
sure . </ i>
<i>you gave us " members .
aol .
juktn .
html . " </ i>
<i> wait .
was that an " m "?
i'm sorry? </ i>
<i>after jukt , was that an " m , " as in " micronics "? </ i>
<i>no , it was an " n " , as in " not working . " </ i>
<i> try " m.
okay . </ i>
<i>sorry about that , i was rushing . </ i>
<i>of course . </ i>
<i>but i do find myself wondering , stephen . </ i>
<i>why would a major software company put their website</ i> <i>where only aol members can access it , as opposed to the entire web? </ i>
i have no idea .
<i>i don't have a website so i don't really know that much about them . </ i>
<i>i would trust you guys to know better than me . </ i>
okay .
looks like ... we have the jukt website up now .
i have to say , stephen ... <i>this looks very suspicious to me . </ i>
how so?
<i>quite frankly , it doesn't look like a real website . </ i>
<i>it looks like a site that was ... created to fool someone . </ i>
<i>i don't know much about computers .
could somebody do that? </ i>
<i> of course .
very easily . </ i>
<i>so easily , in fact , it's incredible . </ i>
<i>do you still want that number for jim ghort?
i found it in my notes . </ i>
<i>yeah , sure . </ i>
<i>all right .
605 , 84 ... </ i>
<i> wait .
sorry? </ i>
<i>" six zero five , " that's not nevada . </ i>
oh .
<i>i guess i got him mixed up with another source . </ i>
<i>er ... </ i>
<i>sorry about that one .
oh , you know what it was? </ i>
<i>jim ghort was the guy who told me about the law enforcement officials . </ i>
<i>i don't know what i was thinking .
i'm going to have to get you ... </ i>
<i>steve . </ i>
<i>give him the number . </ i>
this guy is toast .
<i>all right , stephen , in light of all this, </ i> <i>how confident are you in this story of yours? </ i>
<i>are we off the record? </ i>
if you like .
<i>well , off the record ... </ i> <i>some of the things that you've brought up ... </ i> the website ... <i>the idea that i was always speaking to these people through voicemail ... </ i> <i>that is , that they were always calling me ... </ i> <i>it didn't seem strange before , but clearly, </ i> <i>there are some problems with the story .
you've pointed them out . </ i>
<i>one portion of it was structured in a way that ... </ i>
i just ... well ... in light of all this ...
i just ...
<i>i'm increasingly beginning to believe that i've been duped . </ i>
<i>and so we hang up, </ i> <i>after he's basically let these guys interrogate me for an hour . </ i>
<i>and i go , " chuck , wh what happened? </ i>
i mean , why didn't you back me up?
<i>he goes , " i'm sorry , steve , i've got to protect the magazine . </ i>
<i> i mean , i'm the editor .
typical . </ i>
<i>he's being such an asshole .
so i'm dead , pretty much . </ i>
yes , this is kambiz .
<i>can we have a talk here?
just editor to editor? </ i>
<i>sure .
go ahead . </ i>
<i>completely off the record , and really almost human being to human being? </ i>
<i>of course . </ i>
<i>you guys have discovered something that a troubled kid has done, </ i> but i still don't know how you plan to play it .
<i>we're not in the business of " gotcha " journalism here . </ i>
<i>i have no interest in embarrassing you or the new republic . </ i>
<i>i'm not worried about me or the magazine .
that's fair game, </ i>
<i>but there's a kid here who basically, </ i> <i>just plainly , screwed up .
big time . </ i>
<i>his reporting was sloppy , we know that . </ i>
<i>but we're trying to handle it internally at this point, </ i> just as you would .
<i>listen , we're going to run something</ i> <i>along the lines of , " a trick was pulled, </ i> <i>and some very clever hackers managed to create an illusion . " </ i>
<i>i can't tell you what to print or not to print . </ i>
<i>you guys are journalists . </ i>
<i>but ... he could be very hurt by what you guys publish .
his career . </ i>
<i>chuck , i understand .
i do . </ i>
i would hope if i made the mistakes he made , <i>people would be generous with me . </ i>
<i>but ... </ i> <i>this concerns the very field we cover . </ i>
<i>we have to run it . </ i>
<i>and when we do , we're going to need a comment from you . </ i>
<i>so given everything that's happened, </ i> <i>how strongly are you going to stand behind the story? </ i>
i'm looking into it .
<i>it's really not that big a deal .
you got fooled by a source . </ i>
<i>it happens .
they'll print a retraction , and that'll be that . </ i>
<i>steve , it's not like it's going to hurt your career . </ i>
<i>of course , if you weren't so distracted by your classes, </ i>
<i> maybe this never would've happened .
i know , i gotta quit .
you're right . </ i>
<i>can i speak to you for a minute , steve? </ i>
what about?
<i>let's do it in private . </ i>
<i>we need to take a drive to bethesda . </ i>
<i> what for?
i want to meet joe hiert . </ i>
<i>i already told you , nobody knows where he is . </ i>
<i>maybe if we go to the hotel where he met with restil and sims, </ i> <i>someone will remember him , or have some clue ... </ i>
<i>there were hundreds of people there , okay? </ i>
<i>these forbes guys want to come down on you . </ i>
<i>they are highly suspicious about some of the material in that article . </ i>
you know that .
yeah .
<i>but they're going to go online with their piece tomorrow . </ i>
oh .
okay?
yeah .
now ...
steve?
steve .
yeah?
<i>if we can find hiert, </ i>
<i>i can back them off for a day or two , okay? </ i>
okay .
i'll get my notes .
okay .
<i> let's go .
all right . </ i>
<i>we were at this table . </ i>
<i>restil sat here , his mother was on his left, </ i>
<i>hiert ... sorry , his mother was on his right . </ i>
<i>hiert sat there, </ i> <i>but restil wanted him closer , so he slid his chair over . </ i>
<i>sims sat here .
he had a lawyer next to him . </ i>
<i>i forget the guy's name , it's in my notes . </ i>
<i>somebody was smoking at this table, </ i> <i>so restil's mother insisted that we move to one farther away . </ i>
<i>over there . </ i>
<i>the hacker conference was near here , right? </ i>
<i>yeah , the building next door . </ i>
<i>i don't remember from the article .
how many people were at this thing? </ i>
<i>it looked like a hundred , might have been two .
it's in my notes . </ i>
<i>200 people?
here? </ i>
<i>yeah , they moved in and out .
i mean , most of them were kids . </ i>
<i>that doesn't seem credible to me . </ i>
<i>all i know is i was here . </ i>
<i>all of us were right here . </ i>
<i> excuse me sir , can i help you?
yes , you can . </ i>
<i>we're looking into a conference held here a couple of sundays ago . </ i>
<i>computer hackers .
do you remember anything like that? </ i>
<i>are you sure you're in the right building , sir? </ i>
<i> yes , we're sure .
why is that? </ i>
building's closed on sunday .
<i>all i know is , i was here . </ i>
<i>the conference was right here . </ i>
that's why the restils only stayed a few minutes , okay?
because it was such a dumb place to squeeze into .
<i>so they went to a restaurant for dinner , with some of ian's hacker friends . </ i>
thank you .
how many?
huh?
<i>people at the dinner .
how many? </ i>
about 10 , i think , including me .
<i>lan even put on a jacket . </ i>
<i> hiert was there too?
yeah . </ i>
<i> is it near here?
yeah , it's across the street . </ i>
<i>good , let's cross the street . </ i>
<i>you know , i really don't like the way you're treating me , chuck . </ i>
it's like you won't even talk to me .
this is the place?
yes .
<i>i didn't do anything wrong , okay?
i didn't do anything wrong . </ i>
<i>you saw my notes , everything was in there . </ i>
<i>i got tricked .
i got fooled , i'm sorry .
what are you being so mad for? </ i>
it was 10 people?
yes .
<i> for dinner?
yes . </ i>
<i>they're closed at 3 : 00 on sundays . </ i>
yeah , i know .
i know , they almost didn't let us in .
okay?
<i>but it was a couple of minutes before 3 : 00, </ i> <i>and ian looked like he was about ready to cry , and so they said okay . </ i>
<i> but for dinner?
go in and ask them yourself , chuck . </ i>
<i>see if they would serve a party that came in at 2 : 58</ i> <i>and the answer would be yes , because that's when we got here . </ i>
<i>the forbes guys are gonna have all this too, </ i> <i>and dig through the records at that office building . </ i>
<i>they have surveillance cameras and they're gonna check them . </ i>
<i>i didn't do anything wrong , chuck ! </ i>
<i>i really wish you'd stop saying that ! </ i>
steve ... come on , anyone can make a mistake .
<i>you know , this is not right , chuck ! </ i>
<i>okay , i feel really attacked . </ i>
<i>and you're my editor .
you're supposed to support me, </ i> <i>and you're taking their word against mine? </ i>
<i>you're supposed to support me ! </ i>
<i>criticism of the president's program has been ... </ i>
<i>leave it off . </ i>
<i>i'm sorry i yelled at you back there . </ i>
chuck?
steve !
<i> pull the goddamn car over .
yeah . </ i>
<i>all right . </ i>
<i>there's been so much pressure . </ i>
<i>chuck , i didn't mean to get anybody in trouble . </ i>
okay .
okay .
<i>you weren't at the conference? </ i>
no .
<i>you know , i had a description of it from so many sources, </ i>
i thought i had it solid .
okay?
and i wanted the piece to have an eyewitness feel to it , <i>for color ... so ...
i said i'd been there myself . </ i>
<i>and everything we just told the forbes guys ...? </ i>
<i>i'm so sorry , chuck . </ i>
i just panicked .
if you want me to say that i made it up ...
i will .
if that'll help you , i'll say it .
<i>i just want you to tell me the truth , steve . </ i>
can you do that?
<i>there might be facets of this that you're not considering . </ i>
<i> why are you defending him?
nobody's defending him , chuck . </ i>
<i> of course you're defending him .
he's a kid . </ i>
<i>he doctored his notes , lew .
just consider that for a second . </ i>
you know?
he sat down , <i>and he hand wrote a bunch of phony quotes</ i> <i>and handed them in as source material for the fact check . </ i>
<i> doesn't that offend you?
of course it does . </ i>
<i>he also lied to his editor .
that's supposed to offend you too . </ i>
<i>he's a confused , distraught kid obviously , chuck . </ i>
<i>so suspend him for a couple of months , but let's not bury him . </ i>
suspend him ...
<i>there are also political considerations to take into account here ... </ i> <i>the rest of the staff , the way they feel about him . </ i>
<i> i already know all that .
what i'm saying is, </ i> <i>if you fire him , some of these people will leave . </ i>
i don't know if we'd still have a magazine at the end of the day .
hey , caitlin .
not now , david .
<i> how's he doing?
well , he's a wreck , of course . </ i>
<i> i want him in here , caitlin .
he's too scared to come in here . </ i>
<i>he thinks you want to destroy him .
he knows what he did was horrible . </ i>
he knows how badly he messed up .
<i>the part he's most upset about is iying to you , chuck . </ i>
<i>because he knows you took it as a sign of disrespect</ i> instead of a panic move , which is what it was .
<i>think about the workload he's been carrying ... all this and classes . </ i>
<i>he hasn't slept more than two hours in nine months . </ i>
<i>so he got a little sloppy and he lied to cover his tracks . </ i>
he's sick about it .
caitlin ... <i>the building he described , it doesn't even exist . </ i>
he just made it up .
so ...?
obviously he needs some help .
<i> he needs help .
just get him in here . </ i>
<i>you can't fire him . </ i>
<i>i don't think he'll survive . </ i>
<i>you don't understand , we're all he has . </ i>
<i>you can't fire him , chuck . </ i>
thanks , lew .

<i>i was so sloppy , trusting my sources like that . </ i>
and then iying about it .
and to chuck , of all people ...
i mean , the one guy who's hated me all along .
<i>i'm sure that none of this is personal . </ i>

chuck keeps a list in his head ... <i>everybody who's a " michael kelly " person . </ i>
a couple of times ,
i said some things i shouldn't have said ... about you .
so now i'm on it .
that's why he's so set on killing me now .
<i>well , i have to tell you , steve , he's within his rights . </ i>
<i>the things you did were fireable offenses . </ i>
<i>i know , i'm not saying that they weren't . </ i>
<i>i did some terrible , terrible things . </ i>
<i>but believe me , michael , chuck doesn't care about any of it . </ i>
<i>it's my loyalty to you that he's punishing me for . </ i>
<i>i'm such an idiot . </ i>
<i>now who's going to hire me? </ i>
steve , i have to ask you something .
<i>did you ever " cook " a piece when i was your boss? </ i>
<i>did you ever lie to me? </ i>
<i>the " young conservatives " piece , the mini bottles? </ i>
<i>was that true? </ i>

i just got off the phone with stephen .
<i>he sounds horrible . </ i>
did you suspend him , chuck?
<i>david , what is the problem? </ i>
<i>he asked me if i would drive him out to dulles later tonight . </ i>
<i>he said he wasn't sure he'd be safe driving by himself . </ i>
<i>i just thought i should draw your attention to that . </ i>
<i>did he say where he was going? </ i>
<i>yeah , he said he'd be staying with his family for a while . </ i>
<i>that could only be one of two places . </ i>
<i>his parents live in highland park , right? </ i>
<i>yeah .
or his brother , out in palo alto . </ i>
<i> i'm sorry?
his brother , at stanford . </ i>
<i>chuck? </ i>
<i>you had your brother pose as " george sims . " </ i>

<i>the phony recording from jukt micronics? </ i>
<i>it's a palo alto number . </ i>
<i>your brother is a student at stanford .
you had him pose as sims . </ i>
<i> no , sims is a real guy ...
steve , steve ... </ i>
<i>i've talked to him a million times .
