everyone's leaving town on warren ridge road .
with all the traffic and congestion , believe me , this way's faster .

molly , you tell this boy what 's gonna be .
well ...
we haven 't got all fuckin 'day !
well , until you provide us with a license for a category h weapon ... a firearm , including an air pistol and a blank fire firearm ... under 75 cm in length and a registered gun club membership ... that complies with the amended weapons act regulations of 1997 ... and is signed by a member of the body of the certifying club ...

we got help on the way , we got help on the way !
so you listen to what i say , when i fuckin 'say it ... and we'll all be eating mrs. welman's bbq snags by tomorrow morning .
mrs. welman was eaten out on the road half an hour ago .
you keep fuckin 'messing with me , boy ... and i 'll straighten you out faster than a poofter in a fuckin 'rodeo .

base , please come in it doesn 't work !
tracy , do you hear me?

it was the storm ... ... stopped it all .
mobiles too .
constable , calm down .
where are the rest of the police?
they 're on patrol .
they 're all dead , eaten alive .
i 've never seen anything like this .
i have .
what the hell is happening here?
it 's an invasion .
you have to be fuckin 'kiddin 'me .
the end of life as we know it .
we are the chosen ones .
the ones who will stand and fight .
it 's getting better , you've got shits for brains .
you 're a fuckin 'loonie !
you have all been sent to me ... ... for a reason .
will you just shut your fuckin 'mouth?
you dead shit fuckin 'monkey bag fucker !
these things are brain eating zombies .
there's no such things as zombies .
so how does it feel , rene?
how does it feel to be trapped in this town with the rest of us?
just leave me alone .
you don 't even look at me when i speak to you .
that title was mine again .
i won that competition fair and square .
roping two pigs together isn't a talent fit for winning miss catch of the day .
no bloody way !
she looked alright , though , in that outfit she was wearing .
maybe i don't look as good as you in a bikini right now ... with wayne junior on the way , but ... but i've got asinging voice like an angel and if you hadn 't cheated ...
come on , sallyanne , i was broke !
that was the only reason i entered . ... and forget all about your duties as queen .
you are to preserve the best interest of the town .
that 's your no 1 priority .
ladies , you need to shut up with the girlie talk and calm down .
the situation is under control .
help will be here soon .
if you feel scared , just think of a happy place .
your folks 'farm always seemed to make you happy .
i 'm having a turd of a day .
remember when we were kids ... your dad used to swing us on that tyre he hung from that tree?
we were happy then , there was room to swing ... but you couldn 't swing a cat in here !
thanks , molly .
i don 't get this , how do they know where we were?
they can smell us .
great !
they want to feed off us .
we 're like spam in a fuckin 'can ...
good job !
are we safe in here?
no food , too many people .
and water , where 's your taps?
no taps down here .
the bottled water is upstairs .
you don 't want to drink the tap water .
why?
tap water is tank water ... tank water is rain water , the rain is all part of this attack .
what?
and there was this light coming down from the clouds ... and it was sucking up bugs and stuff .
well that explains it , a light coming down sucking up bugs .
bullshit !
well , people hallucinate some times when they panic , i know i do .
it 's probably just the sunlight coming through the clouds .
that's what it was .
that was no sunlight .
and the meteorites falling?
i saw that .
the whole town saw that .
well , i am no weather girl ... but i am sure this kind of thing happens all the time .
you're a fisherman .
we used to sell these in my store .
damn things sold better than the guns ever did .
it brings me good luck .
and you call this good luck?
i'm still breathing .
she's one of them !
no , she's having a baby !
what baby?
get me to the hospital .
we have to leave .
no one leaves until i say so .
we have to get her out of here .
we 've got two cops here .
they know how to deliver a baby .
that 's right , we do .
there you go .
i 'm sure you do , molly .
see if the cervix is dilated and , sergeant , you mop up her water .
we 're out of here !
molly , get her ready now , do it now !
alright , we 're leaving , let 's go .
we must prepare .
they 're leaving .
they 'll die , we must stick together .
we have to take her to the hospital .
that 's a girl .
i 'm staying here .
we 're leaving .
come , slowly .
come on !
come on !
we gotta get her going !
god !
let 's get out of here !
you gotta be fuckin 'kiddin 'me , pal !
put it down !
put the bag down , get your hands away !
get your hands away .
get up , up , up !
where is the car?
garage .
how do we get there?
through the kitchen .
where are the car keys?
ln the hallway .
can we get to them easily?
depends on what 's still up there .
remember , i 'm in charge .
you go first , big guy .
empty .
they 're all gone .
bingo !
the contractions have stopped .
fuck a dead duck , you little fuckin '... fuck !
these crazy fuckin 'pimply faced fuckin 'gang banger ! fuckin 'come into your fuckin 'house , fuckin 'unin fuckin 'vited !

these things won 't die .
i 've never seen anything like it .
shoot 'em in the brain .
they won 't get back up again .
garage is down there .
we're still the law here .
nobody goes down until i've checked it out .
on your bike , constable .
go on , get down .
what is it , constable?
what is it , constable?
it's clear !
come on down .
are you okay?
are you sure?
shift your arse , pal , i 'm driving this shitbox .
nobody is driving this shitbox but me .
take me to boongabby hospital .
it 's too far .
i don 't want to go back into town .
hurry up !
let's go !
what are you waiting for?
what are you waiting for?
just get us out of here !
we 're nearly out of berkeley now .
shift your arse , princess .
i 'm watching you .
i feel like i 'm going to throw up .
me too .
my god .
this can 't be real .
it 's metal .
you know , i don 't get this .
it takes the council 2 years to fix a pothole in front of my place ... yet they can knock this up in a couple of days .
this ain 't no council job , waynie .
maybe those things built it .
no .
what do you reckon built it then?
i 've never seen anything like this before .
i saw a pineapple twice the size of awatermelon , but nothing like this .
aliens .
here we go again with your crazy arse alien story .
the whole town ... ... is sick of it !
they 're not aliens ... they 're zomies , okay?
happy?
we should go back in the van .
that 's really gonna help , wayne .
well , what do you reckon?
we just gotta think calmly .
my god .
we 're trapped .
we 're all gonna die !
we 're all gonna die !
nobody is dying today , not on my watch !
we 're okay .
i 'm gonna fuckin 'climb it .
what?
you don 't even know how it is .
this is not in discussion !
no way are we going back .
maybe there 's an opening further down .
we 're all fenced in .
dead set?
can i have a look?
doesn 't matter , i climb the poofter here .
sir , do you think that 's such a good idea?
you don 't look real well .
who the fuck is in charge here?
you don 't know what 's inside it .
and what about that help you said was coming?
constable , collect all their weapons and hold on to them ... till my return .
good luck , mate .
i need you to relinquish your weapons .
jesus christ , you 're taking your sweet time , aren 't you?
the storm .
it 's gonna rain .
it 's the rain .
i 've seen it .
sergeant !
sergeant !
it 's gonna rain .
just get in the car .
come , molly , we have to get in the car .
babe , you 're smoking !
pour this on me !
take it , take it , hon .
no , she is one of them !
we have to help him .
fuck him !
he 's gone , let 's go .
come on !
are you burnt?
no , it doesn 't burn , it 's weird .
take it .
molly turned into one of those things .
you must have seen her .
who the hell is that?
it's another one of those zombies .
let 's get out of here .
come on , let 's go !
i wanna go !
hey , nutbag , drive .
i can 't take this anymore , it 's just one monster after another .
aliens , we must fight them .
like hell we must !
keep driving .
i just want to go home .
i 'm having a baby .
molly turned into one of those things .
what are you talking about?
she was normal when i saw her .
look , i know what i saw .
fine , molly turned into a flying zombie , wonderful !
more importantly , what the hell was that thing back there?
you reckon it was one of those aliens you have been talking about?
can't remember what they look like .
we 're gonna die .
well , think , it could have been any poor bastard back there .
i just want my mum .
there's gotta to be another way out .
damn , skippy , we 're flying out .
what makes you think things are better over that wall?
it couldn 't be any worse .
listen to him ... if we go over the wall , we should go prepared .
what do you suggest?
well , we need supplies and stuff ... ... we should stop in town first .
we should go straight to the airfield ... because those things could be everywhere .
no , no .
honey , she is right , we should go back into town .
this is crazy .
all right .
alright , take us into town .
maybe they all got out in time .
no , we left town long before anyone else .
right , get out .
just stay there .
can you see anyone?
you want to get out of here , right?
of course .
watch him , make sure he doesn 't do anything stupid .
and we 'll go in there .
babe , give that gun to rene .
no way , i'm not giving it to her .
babe ...
give that gun to rene , i give you mine .
good girl .
alright , stick close to me .
let 's shop .
it 's warm .
tastes like camel piss .
ropingtwo pigs together isn't a talent fit forwinning miss catch of the day !
you know , you act crazy .
i 'm just doing what i must do .
why do you believe you must do anything?
you know why .
that alien story of yours .
yes , i was attacked .
i 've heard that story before .
no , you haven 't .
i was almost eaten by their killer fish .
it all seems so crazy .
giant walls , acid rain , zombies .
crazy has definitely come to this town for avisit .
after the fish attack they abducted me .
i must have fought them off somehow ...
i can't remember how , but they threw me back to earth .
not only did i survive the fish attack and the abduction ...
i walked away without ascratch .
it 's a gift , a power i have .
i must use it to fight , but i can 't do it alone .
there is no one left but us four .
jesus christ , babe , could you make any much fuckin 'noise?
the other two are heading down the same track as the cops .
think about what you 've just seen .
i am not crazy , the strongest ones are always the last ones left . you have the same strength i have .
i don 't feel strong , i feel sick again .
i think the infection is in the air now .
molly?
but time is short , so you'd better ask yourself
are you a fighter , fish queen?
or are you zombie food?
i just want things to be back to normal again .
i want my farm back .
then take it back .
take the whole town back .
alright , let 's go .
stop !
stop , save your bullets .
mate , where did you hide those?
go , go !
come on , let 's go .
come on !
get in , get in !
come on !
come on , come on , the loopy prick 's gone .
get in !
come on .
god !
it 's the rain , get your coat off .
rene , come on !
you stay here , alright?
no , wayne , please don 't go .
i 'll be back , alright?
what are you doing?
we need this stuff .
here , take this .
wayne !
come on !
come on !
who are you , what 's going on?
wayne !
come on !
shit !
molly?
i 'm over the wall !
we have an explosion .
roger .
going to investigate .
send helpover here .
i 've found a body .
we need assisance , we need assisance !
over here !
there's somebody over here !
we've found a body , looks like a police officer .
there's nobody else?
we 've found one victim ...
iooks like the pilot .
stay behind the barricades .
if you go through the barricade , you'll be shot .
if you go through the barricade you will be shot !
we will open fire !
the army is preventing anyone from entering or leaving ... the town of berkeley .
those who broke through the blockade this morning ... are now quarantined along with the rest of the town's residents .
it is believed that fragments from the nierle comet ... created a meteor shower over the township .
no evidence of the alleged plague sweeping through the town ... has been reported since the departure of the alien craft .
at this point we can confirm that berkeley ... is the only community to be bombarded with these fragments .
it 's a boy .
he 's fine .
good .
i 'm sure wayne will be okay .
nurse , nurse !
i 've been shot .
someone shot me !
someone shot me !
someone shot me !
all those people ... they wouldn 't have died if we didn't shoot them .
i think you are forgetting the whole thing ... when they were trying to rip off our heads and suck out our brains .
your wounds from the fish attack that magically heeled ... the rain did that , didn't it?
aliens are the saviours , not us .
one day you 're out on your boat , you get attacked by zombie fish .
they munch at your face ...
iike you are the main course at a crazy country boy buffet .
you walk away , tell the town your story ... they think you 're mad , everyone thinks you 're mad .
you think i 'm mad .
no , you 're not mad .
it happens again ... this time it 's not zombie fish , it 's zombie berkeley .
but this time i 'm prepared .
i 'm ready to fight whatever they can throw at me .
still , i wasn 't strong enough .
the strongest ones are always the last ones left .
if that 's not me , it must be you .
i 'm just a fish queen , nothing more .
if that was the case , you wouldn 't have battled the undead and lived .
you would have been the entree on asmorgasboard of brain food .
take care , marion .
brings me good luck .
you callthis good luck?
the outbreak moved faster this time .
it spread so quickly , it couldn't be stopped .
it spread beyond berkeley and across the country .
those that i could save from the medical centre are here now .
safe .
at least for the time being .
the last couple of months have been nothing but clear skies .
the aliens haven't come back , maybe some daythey will .
until then , i must contain the infection .
sallyanne said that my first duty as catch of the day winner ... is to preserve the best interests of the town .
