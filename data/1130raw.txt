bingo !
lajunen , from the gents .
we have a dead man here .
his pulse is fading .
we're losing him .
perhaps it's better this way than a life as a vegetable .
5 . 12 a . m .
what is the deceased's name?
we don't know .
notify the morgue .
i'm needed at the maternity ward .
is he dead?
no , he's moving .
see you outside?
in a minute .
what should we do?
take him to the hospital?
i don't know .
he's run away from the prison mental hospital .
we'll ask him when he's better .
until then , we'll let him rest .
you're the boss .
yes .
get some eggs and milk .
don't stay out all evening .
thank you .
so he can talk .
sure .
i just haven't had anything to say be fore .
you're kind .
i don't know about that .
we've been luck y ... this place and a job for nieminen .
what does he do?
he's a night watchman at the coal yard .
just a couple of nights a week , but still .
we can soon apply for a council flat .
they'll be taking in new applications in a year or two .
that is fine .
what are you?
i don't know .
you don't know?
my head's damaged somehow .
i don't even remember who i am .
my , that's bad .
care for a cup of coffee?
no thank s .
it's friday .
let's go out for dinner .
oh what joy !
i have found a friend
my s ins are w as he d aw ay
i'm always blessed by my friend
he brings sweet peace to my soul
he comforts me when the road is rough
my saviour walks close to me
i'm free d from misery and sorrow
as long as jesus i follow
he's a faithful friend
will you have a beer if i buy you one?
i'll take offence and turn mean if you refuse .
or are you an anti alcoholic?
don't think so .
as far as i know .
i got paid today .
not much but enough for us to have two beers without kaisa noticing .
perhaps .
two beers .
i'm paying .
a seagull .
an ashtray .
a stub .
a taunus .
eight times eight?
sixty one .
seventy two .
a woman .
you make jokes , that's good .
never give up , even if you've lost your memory .
life goes on , not back wards .
you'd be in trouble if it did .
ho w much do you remember?
i was on a train .
it was dark outside .
and be fore that?
it's all b lack .
your childhood?
not a sound , just a gloomy night .
your name?
your age?
forget it .
i was on a train , that's all .
what about helsinki?
are you from here?
don't think so .
the city seems strange to me .
another round?
maybe there's a blood clot in the part of your head where the memory is .
alcohol will dissolve it .
you have one .
bring me water .
i used to do a lot of drinking when i was younger , be fore my marriage .
i could drink for two day s in a row .
but you're young only once .
workman's hands .
you've done something .
something simple , you don't look like a reading man .
thank s .
you're welcome .
i'll get that beer .
hey , mate !
missed .
just a thought .
i saw a film as a child where a man got his memory back when struck again in the same spot .
i see .
yes .
thank s for the beer .
i'll tak e a walk no w .
you're welcome .
it gave me the excuse to drink eight .
i may get a whipping at home , though .
stand up for yourself .
see you .
she won't hit in front of the kids .
ciao .
this is the man .
this here's anttila .
the whip of god .
to my friends .
what sort of a man are you?
he doesn't know .
found on the beach some sort of driftwood .
let the man speak for himself .
this is a private beach but if you have a cigarette
i can let it go .
for once .
all i have is roll ups .
then it means prison .
your interests may be mutual .
he needs a place to stay .
that'd make a difference .
if you lived here
i naturally wouldn't arrest you .
got one?
what?
a place to rent?
does a bird have wings , does a wolf cry out his loneliness?
erik son's container's empty .
where is he?
froze to death last winter .
all this is unofficial , of course .
if the authorities ask anything
i shall deny you thrice like peter denied christ at the coal fire .
as it happens i don't even know who i am .
then we must do an oral agreement .
a hundred .
a month?
a week .
paid in advance each monday .
it's not cheap .
i must make a living , too .
many people would pay triple for a sea vie w .
and you don't look like you'd last the winter .
you seem to be quite plump yourself .
keep my metabolism out of this .
what about the electricity?
included in the rent .
there's the power company pylon .
i can lend you a screwdriver .
when can i move in?
as soon as i turn my back .
and the keys?
you see a lock any where?
no .
don't go splitting hairs then or i'll take the door , too .
a month's rent , in advance .
tomorrow , god willing .
he moves in mysterious ways .
if you don't pay up
i'll send my killer dog to bite your nose off .
it only causes trouble any way , shadows the way wherever i go .
it's no more smoking in the shower for you .
bye .
may i take this?
go ahead .
thanks .
what do i owe you?
if you see me face down in the gutter , turn me onto my back .
kaisa promised you a mattress .
we've an extra one .
a jukebox .
won't work .
these were left over .
it should work now .
the soup had too little salt in it .
perhaps the rain watered it down .
there was cabbage and potatoes , any way .
what more do you want?
meat?
never .
good it was .
what's your name?
angling for another plateful?
no chance .
you look lousy , by the way .
i've had misfortunes but i'll overcome them in a couple of days .
visit us .
you need new clothes .
looking like that , no one'll take you seriously .
so i've noticed .
and try to pull yourself together .
bye now , i must hurry .
i was told to pull my self together .
know how to do the washing?
never bothered to learn , kaisa's always seen to it .
so far .
nor do we have a washing machine as i don't have any credit .
but the neighbour has one 'cause he's wealthy .
come in !
i'd make some coffee but i ain't got none .
thanks , but i'm in a hurry .
how are you?
if the garbage collectors 'strike continues
i must go on a diet or move away .
where's this village's employment agency?
see that church tower?
follow its shadow and you're there .
excellent !
isn't it?
no w , if you'll allow me .
i'm sorry , i can't do this .
surely you know how to write your name?
yes .
but these questions ...
i'll help you .
it's not difficult .
your surname , both given names date and place of birth , social security number .
can i help?
wait here .
are you making fun of us?
surely you have a name?
course i do .
i was hit on the head , several times in fact .
that's why i can't ... remember everything .
why don't you ask your mother or your friends?
every one around here has friends .
i've got one too .
but he doesn't know either .
did he hit his head too?
the drama school's round the corner they might have some use for you .
don't waste our time again !
some people want to work .
what about social assistance?
they want a name , too .
now get out of my sight .
drugs you can find on the streets .
do you charge for it?
not for the water .
go ahead .
leftovers from lunch .
you look hungry .
i've got no money .
doesn't matter .
it goes to waste otherwise .
do you drink milk?
you came for the clothes .
i came because you gave me the address .
but it's no use , i can't buy anything .
i'm an outcast .
that's no news to us .
you pay back when you're back on your feet again .
all these are donations .
you won't get ahead looking like that .
god's mercy reigns in heaven but here on the earth one must help oneself .
the fitting room's in the corner .
you'll go far yet .
you don't look like a drunk .
like to tell me what happened to you?
if you tell me your name .
i asked it once already and in my present situation i'm afraid to talk to strangers .
it's irma .
wait in there .
there's a wretched man out there .
i think we should help him .
all right .
ask him in .
these need to be sorted and carried inside .
jokinen will help you to start .
jokinen .
looks cosy .
perhaps i should raise the rent .
that's what i wanted to talk about .
i can't pay until friday .
attack !
you were luck y .
usually people end up dead .
start to pack .
the money will be there .
as certainly as death .
that's what gets you if you fail to pay .
i've become so ft .
i'll drive my self out of the business .
i'll be in tallinn for a week .
the dog stay s here , watching you .
he only eats raw meat .
i'll take care of him .
he takes care of himself .
don't try to pet him or you've thrown your last dart .
does he have a name?
hannibal .
as our work is based on charity we cannot pay you the kind of salary private employers do .
i understand .
sign here .
will a cross do?
do you live some where?
i've got a home , in a dormitory .
may i escort you there?
the streets are not safe these days .
it's not far , i can manage .
i'm sure you can .
i was thinking of myself .
i'm afraid of the dark .
it's not proper , with a stranger .
but we are colleagues .
all right , let's go .
is this where you live?
yes .
thank you for escorting me .
i wasn't afraid for a moment .
that's fine .
look out !
what?
there's something in your eye .
i can't feel anything .
it's just going in there .
let me have a look .
you stole a kiss .
forgive me .
i'm not a gentleman .
will we see each other tomorrow?
without doubt , if you come to work .
good night .
satisfactory .
hannibal .
here , boy .
he's a girl .
the man who sold it said he's a male .
he'd better return the money .
no wonder he's no good .
ho w was the trip to estonia?
i achieved my goals .
can i borrow your car for saturday night?
i've never lent any one anything in my life .
twenty per hour , plus petrol .
greed is a mortal sin .
i run a business .
the state protects business .
the state does not sin .
quo vadis .
reservation fee's fifty .
are you sure i can't help?
i think it's ruined already .
any way , it's ready .
do you cook often?
not very often .
the peas were fine .
i went to the moon yesterday .
i see .
ho w was it?
peaceful .
meet any one?
not really , it was a sunday .
is that why you came back?
yes .
and for other reasons , too .
are you pretending or don't you really remember anything?
i do remember something ...
a factory hall by a long straight stretch of a highway .
i did something .
a bright flame , it's hot ...
it may be a dream .
i've started having them again .
that's a good sign .
perhaps .
the thought of a grave with no name ...
shall we sit on the couch and listen to some music?
the spring of god is never dry
you can drink and slake your thirst
it's filled with the water of life
always cool , clear and bright
my spring of life never seems to dry
it's never touched by the droughts of time
my soul , oh ...
with all due respect , guys .
haven't you ever thought of expanding your repertoire into rhythm music?
why?
this is what we always play .
i've got records at home . bues , r& b , rock'n'roll .
come and listen , if you want .
why not in our free time .
around here the music code is pretty strict .
i can have a word upstairs .
regeneration would be fine .
we've heard about rock .
by widening your repertoire you may reach new target groups who then with time may find the movement interesting .
and i do believe that while the guy s 'new sty le is in part worldly it might be beneficial to the movement .
so far , music hasn't killed any one .
we could give it a try .
i used to do some singing my self when i was younger .
let's go .
because tomorrow is midsummer although originally a pagan feast our choir will now make an exception and perform a song about the human heart .
in its lyrics , however , we discover thoughts of the futility of our worldly life without christ .
so small is the heart of man
so vast , uncharted land
within it you find the grandest dreams
the worlds of hate and love
the wealth of all joy , the sum of all sorrows
glorious love and pain's poisonous arrows
all can be found in the smallest of hearts
happiness , joy , oh !
shallow thoughts and noble ideals
burning emotions and frozen feelings
all those can be found in the smallest of hearts
all that fate brings by
i wonder if this was a wise thing to do .
god knows , but let them dance .
will you come out with me on saturday?
we are out now .
i've got a car , too .
i can't set up shady meetings during working hours .
but it's all right .
so s mall is the he art of man
so vast , uncharted land
within it you find the grandest dreams ...
where do you want to go?
into the woods .
i have a basket for mushrooms .
let's take hannibal , too , shall we?
of course .
she'll protect us from the wolves .
well?
are these eatable?
some are .
this one , though , is lethally poisonous .
indeed .
it was a good catch , wasn't it?
it'll make a meal .
now what?
we'll go and check the guys out .
i got them a gig .
i've been thinking about becoming a rock'n'roll manager .
you're very energetic nowadays .
you've regained your joy of life .
i feel strong because you inspire me .
it's all mercy .
i'm haunted by the devil , down the corner , every street
wherever i may ramble , he is always there to greet
he's staring at me calmly in the bottom of my glass
he's smiling at me wicked with the lips of an unknown lass
i'm haunted by the devil , every day and every night
wherever i may ramble , he is always by my side
just when i think i don't have to worry any more
if he's not behind me , he's knocking on the door
go d , please help me , keep me in the line
through the straight and narrow would you always kindly sign
god , please help me , would you be my guide
please , don't let me be tempted , keep me aw ay from the darker side
the shadow's always covering the warm side of the sun
waiting for the night to spoil the dreams of every one
if i show a happy face and even s mile to day
the luck is changing , game is different almost everyday
tickets .
what do you mean?
you haven't paid .
but i organised this .
that's what you think .
is that so?
yes .
fancy that .
that's outrageous !
it is , isn't it?
may i give it a try , too?
go ahead .
we've got work for you .
report in the office and start next monday at seven .
i don't care if you say your name's
franklin delano roosevelt and say you were born in the deserts of egypt as long as i get what i need for the taxes and pension payments .
that's all the state cares about , and i even less .
every other worker comes from kirghizia now and changes e very two week s .
but you need a bank account .
can't you pay me in cash , like in the old days?
and how do you suppose the banks would survive?
no one could control the way you spend your money .
you'd be like a pig in a barley field , with no control .
but i have this name problem .
we'll find a name for you .
don't be so helpless !
open a numbered account in switzerland and come back .
good day .
how are you?
not too good .
how can i help?
i want to open an account .
fill this in .
you don't understand .
they ask my name .
i mean a numbered account
like they have in switzerland .
this one'll have a number too , but you need a name any way .
switzerland's more liberal , but here in finland ...
where's e very one?
this is a small bank , there's no one else .
i'd like to take out 247, 000 from this account .
the money is there but the account is frozen .
i know .
what's that?
a security camera , but ...
it doesn't work .
not any more , any way .
start counting the money .
i haven't got that much here , i must get it from the vault .
you come with us .
be careful , i don't want too much .
don't worry , i know my work .
there will be no extra money .
i'd have to pay it back my self .
i must close the door to give me a head start .
i'm sorry .
perfectly understandable in your position .
it's good you understand .
now stay there .
it didn't work out then .
what?
opening the account .
wouldn't have made any difference .
this is the last day we're open .
why?
the whole bank was sold to north korea .
what did the bank manager say?
nothing .
he decided on a personal solution being fired after 38 years 'service .
one year be fore retirement age .
i see .
yes .
we're running out of oxygen .
the air conditioning was cut off for financial reasons .
luckily the police will come immediately after the alarm .
what alarm?
so we'll die here .
we can always just breathe out .
do you mind if i smoke?
does a tree mourn for a fallen leaf?
you're not making much sense .
it was nice meeting you .
the pleasure was all mine .
this won't take long .
we just need some in formation .
besides refusing to reveal his identity the questioned had no identity papers .
under the circumstances , the records of the hearing have not been signed by him , despite repeated requests .
there fore we have decided to arrest him until his identity and possible involvement in the crime has been solved .
got your memory back yet?
not yet .
we don't suspect you of participation in the crime .
the bank clerk's story was quite straightforward .
then i can go , can't i?
the vagrancy act has been revoked but we have rules and regulations to keep you here .
you could be a foreigner .
but i speak finnish .
you people learn fast .
you don't look finnish .
how did you get into the country?
just a moment .
i believe i've got a right to make one phone call .
you've been watching too many films .
who'd you call , any way?
my girlfriend .
you've been bus y , haven't you?
i guess she has a name?
not for you .
inkeri speaking .
irma !
it's for you .
hallo?
a person commits insubordination by re fusing to give the police particulars stated in subsection 10 of the police act .
if the law does not require a harsher punishment he must be sentenced to a fine or to a maximum of three months in prison for insubordination .
what do you say to that?
he say s nothing .
i am his lawyer and will represent the suspect from no w on .
that section of the law only applies if you can prove that my client did it deliberately and with premeditation .
this is not the case , however , because it was due to a probably temporary loss of memory caused by violence .
the 1920 supreme court ruling number 116 states that by holding him in custody for more than 48 hours the police are not only guilty of misconduct but also of deprivation of freedom .
following my advice my client has , however refrained from filing a suit if set free immediately and no other action against him will be taken because of this incident .
chapter 8 , paragraph 2 of the mental health act enables an involuntary committal to a psychiatric hospital due to an obvious need caused by a serious mental disturbance failure of which action would radically worsen his condition .
subsection 3 makes that clearly applicable only if no other mental health services are usable in his case .
to be able to apply the law you should have within 48 hours procured a doctor's referral for observation .
may i see one?
please leave us for a moment .
you can wait in the corridor .
that's it then .
for now .
stay away from further trouble , especially from the law .
here's a cigar for you .
who sent you?
the salvation army .
it's you .
i followed you from the police station .
why?
to apologise .
i got you in trouble .
i was in trouble already .
i thought you might do me a favour , for a fee .
i had an earthmoving firm .
i bought two new machines and then everything collapsed , you remember .
the bank called in my loan getting rid of " unreliable clients " .
the machines were sold to the bank below cost .
three week s later the bank sold them for three times that much .
you understand what i'm saying?
more or less .
when my account was suddenly frozen
i could not pay the salaries for men who'd already done their job .
i had to let them go and still owed them money .
can a man stand that?
no .
no .
i agree .
so i did what i did .
the money was mine any way .
will you do me the favour?
what is it?
too many people here .
let's talk in some other place .
the sums and the names are on the envelopes and the in formation where you can find them .
i come from the north , and we pay our debts .
here .
and this is for you .
why don't you do it yourself?
too risky .
the police know who did the robbery .
in that case this is not the safest place for you .
doesn't matter , any more .
will you do it?
yes .
tell the boys i'm sorry for what happened but there it is .
you'd better go no w .
who is thls man?
bank robber refuses to reveal hls name
rather small potatoes .
the weather was bad .
but they'll make a soup .
when did you plan to make it?
why so interested?
i have an onion .
you need it for the soup .
i've got eight potatoes .
i must save three for the winter and at least two as seed potatoes .
we farmers must think of the coming years , too .
we only eat what is left over .
there's not enough for three , i want to invite irma to dinner .
so none for me?
right .
you're selfish .
i'm a realist .
you city people are children of the moment .
you might be a city man yourself .
with a harvest like this?
never .
give me half a potato , for scurvy .
i won't survive without teeth .
must go .
we've discovered your identity .
really?
we leaked your photo to the press and your wife contacted us today .
my wife ... yes .
your name is jaakko antero lujanen .
does it sound familiar?
are you sure?
yes .
you are a metal worker from nurmes .
what did you say about a wife?
she's absolutely certain .
the local police showed her your photo .
i don't know why your disappearance wasn't reported .
if you do have a wife ... some where there you must return home .
i don't want to .
marriage is sacred .
i brought the train schedules .
will you stay a moment longer?
it wouldn't be proper especially now that you're married .
you could help me to pack .
but you have nothing .
that's why .
let's just sit , quiet .
i made you sandwiches .
your home is so far away .
you won't forget ...
the child of sorrow?
how could i?
you were my first love .
that was beautifully said .
yes .
go now .
it's time .
hi .
hi .
is your mother home?
you always were lousy at flattery .
did you wait for me?
for years .
forgive me for asking but ...
did we fight a lot?
you really don't remember much , do you?
not a thing .
we did .
more and more .
it led to a divorce .
i don't understand .
did i drink too much?
no , not at all .
you never touched a drink .
i didn't?
instead you gambled .
fruit machines , pin ball machines , poker , anything .
you lost all your lps playing blackjack .
then what happened?
we carried on for a time .
your guilt complexes made you speechless .
i wasn't much better my self .
finally we slept in separate rooms .
go on .
we filed for divorce .
you went south after a job and i never heard from you .
until i saw you in the paper .
suddenly you were famous .
a photo and all .
now what?
the divorce came through in june .
i would've sent you the papers but you left me no address .
when you never called
i thought you didn't care .
i'm sorry .
i got beaten up .
i'd have written if i'd known about you .
i'm ovaskainen .
lujanen .
shall we fight , then?
why?
i love that woman .
that's good .
she seems to like you , too .
what do you mean?
nothing .
nothing?
yes .
so no demands?
why should i have?
love each other as you would love yourself .
talk properly .
we are divorced .
seems like things weren't too good earlier , either .
so we don't need to fight?
i don't see any reason for it .
i guess you're a better man than what i've heard .
i'll let that one pass .
just one request .
be good to her .
ok .
sure .
want a ride to the station?
yes , please .
now that all's been settled you can say goodbye to her , if you want .
your sake , sir .
thank you .
i thought we already killed that one once .
so you decided to come back .
obviously .
what's this?
they get what they deserve .
they've beaten up many of us .
us?
yes .
i'll call for an ambulance , but not too soon if you don't mind .
shall we go?
where to?
where were you going?
home .
there's a social evening in the canteen .
i remember the prettiest of parks
the wonderful monrepos
my dr ams often take me back
to that leafy fairy land
the prettiest arched bridges
the loveliest moonlit nights
i have seen in the park of monrepos
back to the by gone times
my thoughts again they fly
the days of the past
the wondrous tales that last
still come alive in my mind
i remember the beautiful park
the wonderful monrepos
forever i've hidden in my he art the park
of monrepos
my thoughts again return ...
you did not stay away for long .
no .
for a moment i was afraid .
for no reason .
