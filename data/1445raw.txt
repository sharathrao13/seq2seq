we've got 1 9 minutes to get a message in if we can break this .
the tattler can't hold its presses any longer .
it's something simple .
they only needed cover against casual readers .
i'm thinking it's a book code .
book code? .
the first numeral 1 00 prayers could be the page number .
the paired numbers after that could be line and letter .
but what book? .
not the bible? .
he's got galatians 1 5 : . 2 .
galatians only has six chapters .
same with jonah 6 : . 8 .
jonah has four chapters .
he wasn't using a bible .
then the tooth fairy named the book to use .
he specified it in his note in the part lecter tore out .
it would appear so .
what about sweating lecter?
in a mental hospital , i would think drugs no .
they tried sodium amytal on him three years ago ... trying to find out where he buried a princeton student .
he gave 'em a recipe for dip .
besides , if we sweat him , we lose the connection .
if the tooth fairy picked the book , then it's something he knew lecter would have .
can we get a list of his books? .
from chilton , maybe .
no , wait .
rankin and willingham , when they tossed his cell ... took polaroids so they could put everything back in place .
ask them to meet me with pictures of his bookshelves .
where? .
the librart .
will , i'm leery of letting lecter's message run without knowing what it says .
i say let this one run .
we keep working on the code .
at least it'll encourage the tooth fairy to contact him again .
what if it encourages him to do something besides write? .
i don't like this any better than you , but it's our best shot .
oh , my god .
hello .
jack , it's lloyd bowman .
i solved the code .
you need to know what it says right now .
okay , lloyd .
it says , " graham home , marathon , florida .
save yourself .
kill them all .
yeah? .
bowman just broke the code .
what does it say? .
i'll tell you in a second .
listen .
everything is okay .
i've taken care of it , so stay on the phone when i tell you .
tell me now .
lecter gave the bastard your home address .
wait , wait .
will? .
will !
mom? .
is he after you now?
no , no .
lecter just suggested it to him .
i hate this .
molly , i 'm i 'm sorry .
it's a sick feeling .
i know it is .
but you'll be safe here .
crawford's brother owns this place .
no one in the world knows you're here .
i'd just as soon not talk about crawford .
beneath the yellow folder you'll find your latest rejection slip from the archives .
it was brought to me by mistake with some of my archives mail .
i'm afraid i opened it without looking .
sorry .
i think we'll remove dr. lecter's toilet seat as well .
atlanta p. d. nailed him .
he had a fake bureau i. d .... and was trying to get the leeds family autopsy photos .
it's a federal beef , so atlanta kicked him back to us .
i'd like nothing better than to see this dirt sandwich pulling five at leavenworth .
but maybe there's a better way to handle this .
yeah , what's that? .
i think we ought to give him a story .
the tooth fairt's ugly and he's impotent with members ofthe opposite sex .
mm hmm .
also , he , uh , sexually molests his male victims .
while they're alive? .
sorrt .
i can't go into those details .
but we do also speculate that he's the product of an incestuous home .
mm hmm .
no wonder the creep's such a loser , right? .
that's a tip we got from dr. lecter , by the way .
so it's true lecter's actually helping with your investigation .
yes , it's true .
the doctor was offended that a bottom feeding lowlife ...
like the tooth fairy would consider himself in the same league .
okay .
uh
tell me about this place you got here , will your little washington hideaway .
this is just an apartment i'm borrowing till this creep goes down in flames .
i keep copies of all the evidence here so that i can work on it late at night .
make sure you can read the name on that building .
yeah .
i got enough .
just remember .
i scratch your back , you scratch mine .
and if my story draws the fairy into any kind ofattack on graham ... and you nail the scumbag , i get an exclusive .
fuck you , lounds .
when we see the story in print , then we'll consider what to do about your sealed indictment .
yeah , yeah .
it's a pleasure doing business with you .
chumps .
i feel like i need a shower .
you okay with this? .
better he comes after me than molly and josh .
so , yeah , i'm okay with it .
i wish we had something better , but there's only ten days till the next full moon .
we've gotta rattle his cage .
we'll stake out this apartment , put snipers on the nearby rooftops .
also , you'll have a moving box tail 24/ 7 in your car , on the street , wherever you go .
you'll wear the kevlar at all times , no exceptions .
you again? .
come back at 4 : 00 a . m . when i open , all right? .
hey !
hey , i told you
what? .
you told me what? .
fucking dick .
is that your fucking name on the sign? .
ow .
where am i? .
what am i doing here? .
atoning , mr. lounds .
i haven't seen your face .
i couldn't possibly identify you .
i work for the national tattler .
it would , uh , pay a big , uh , reward a big reward for me .
i mean , a half a million
a million , maybe .
do you know who i am , mr. lounds?
no .
and i don't wanna know .
you know , believe me .
according to you ,
i'm a vicious , perverted sexual failure .
a bottom feeding lowlife who's about to go down in flames .
i think you know now , don't you?
yes .
do you understand what i'm doing , mr. lounds?
no .
but i i would i'd like to .
i really want to ... understand .
and then all my readers could understand too .
i am not a man .
i began as one , but each being that i change ... makes me more than a man , as you will witness .
i don't need to see you .
no .
oh , but you must , mr. lounds .
you're a reporter .
you're here to report .
open your eyes and look at me .
no .
if you don't open them yourself , i'll staple your eyelids toyour forehead .
i don't want to .
open your eyes !
oh , my dear god .
jesus .
oh , god .
do you want to know what i am? .
more than anything .
i was afraid to ask .
do you see now?
yeah , i see .
oh , god .
mrs. jacobi in human form .
do you see? .
yes .
mrs. leeds in human form .
do you see?
yes .
mrs. jacobi changing .
oh , my god .
do you see? .
mrs. leeds changing .
do you see? .
mrs. jacobi reborn .
do you see?
mrs. leeds reborn .
do you see? .
please , no .
no? .
no what? .
not me .
god , not me .
why did you write lies , mr. lounds? .
graham told me to lie .
graham .
it wasn't me .
will you tell the truth now? .
yes .
about me? .
mywork? .
oh , yes , yes .
my becoming? .
yeah .
ya yeah .
i am the dragon , and you call me insane .
you are privy to a great becoming ... but you recognize nothing .
no .
you are an ant in the afterbirth .
it is in your nature to do one thing correctly .
before me you rightly tremble .
but fear is not what you owe me , mr. lounds .
you owe me awe .
read .
that's all , mr. lounds .
you did vert well .
you'll let me go now? .
soon .
there is one more way i can help you to better understand .
i i i wanna understand .
i do .
and i 'm really gonna be fair ... from now on .
you know that .
hello? .
i have hada great privilege .
i have seen with wonder and awe ... the strength of the great red dragon .
he has helped me to understand his splendor .
and now i want to serve him .
he knows you made me lie , will graham .
because i was forced to lie , he will be more merciful to me ... than to you .
hello? .
oh , god !
we can let this tie us up in knots ... or we can learn from it .
maybe even use it to catch the bastard .
he had to have a van or panel truck to move lounds around in that big old wheelchair .
mm hmm .
go on .
anybody .
he had to already have the wheelchair , too , or know where to get one fast .
it's an antique , not the kind of thing you find around the house .
does it strike anybody that he set this up in one hell of a hurry? .
the tattler comes off the press monday night .
bytuesday morning he's in chicago snatching lounds .
he either lives in the chicago area or he's within a driving radius ... of ... call it six hours .
find out within this area where the tattler was available for early distribution .
start with the airports and all night newsstands .
maybe some newsy remembers an odd customer .
lloyd , this cassette enhance the audio .
maybe you could pick up something in the background .
beverly , jimmy , that wheelchair
i want the maker , date , possible sources .
graham and i will coordinate from chicago .
let's hustle .
look , there's not gonna be any answers in chicago , jack .
okay , i mean , lounds that was a bonus .
that was just a chance to show off .
it doesn't even fit his pattern .
the leeds and the jacobis are what he needs .
i think i should go back to baltimore .
after what he tried to pull? .
i think lecter picked up on something in the missing part ofthat note .
maybe not a name , but something .
enough to narrow the search .
he won't tell you .
not unless i can offer him something .
congratulations , will .
that was most artistic of the way you disposed of the annoying mr. lounds .
your cell looks bigger with no books in it .
does it? .
i hadn't noticed .
well, you will .
i have other resources .
tell me , will .
did you enjoy it? .
your first murder? .
of course you did .
and why shouldn't it feel good?
it does to god .
only last week in texas , he dropped a church roof on the heads of 34 of his worshippers , just as they were groveling for him .
he wouldn't begrudge you one journalist .
put me next to him , doctor .
you and some swa t team?
oh , will , where's the fun in that? .
he'll have to take his chances too .
a roof can fall on anybody .
but not on molly and josh , i take it .
not yet anyway .
first he kills the pet , then the family .
freddy was your pet .
they're safe now .
no one will ever be safe around you , will .
clever work on his note , by the way .
and that blackout was an especially nice touch .
what else was in that note , doctor? .
put me next to him .
that's what you want , isn't it? .
to help him succeed where you failed ... twice .
give him a chance to kill me .
go on then .
seduce me with your wares .
full restoration of your privileges , plus computer access to the a. m. a. archives one hour a week , under supervision of course .
but this is a one time offer .
it expires the minute i walk out ofhere .
a bit measly , don't you think? .
turn it down then .
see what kind of terms you get from chilton .
ooh .
are these threats , william? .
i'm waiting , doctor .
or maybe you've got nothing left to sell .
a little sample then .
why not? .
seen the blake , have you? .
yes .
no , you've looked but not seen .
transformation is the key .
the man/ dragon his ugliness transformed by power .
look for a militartrecord with combat training .
look for extensive tattooing ... and corrective surgery , most likely to the face .
come on .
i'm past all that already , and you know it .
now give me what i need .
how is he choosing the women? .
i've already suggested how .
the answer was right in front ofyou .
you looked but didn't see .
bullshit !
no riddles .
just tell me .
no .
it's your turn .
i asked you before for a small courtesy , and you responded rudely .
before i tell you anything more , you will make certain arrangements for me .
what kind of arrangements? .
oh , nothing much .
shall we say dinner and a show? .
you ready to tell me what kind of outing this is? .
nope .
you're just full of surprises , aren't you , d.? .
yep .
he's about six feet away .
can you smell him? .
yeah .
now , he's a little noisy , but he's sedated .
i assure you .
dr. hassler's about to fix his broken tooth .
glad you could come .
we appreciate the infrared film , by the way .
two more steps .
i 'll put your left hand on the edge of the table .
okay , he's right in front of you .
take your time .
d.? .
i'm here .
you go ahead .
here .
why don't you try this? .
nine steps from the front door to the clock and three more to this room .
sorry .
force of habit .
## [ mellow swing ]
that beautiful tiger , this house , this music
i don't think anybody knows you at all , d.
everybody wonders about you though .
especially the women .
what do they want to know? .
they find you ... very mysterious ... and interesting .
did they tell you how i look? .
they said that you have a remarkable body .
that you're very sensitive about your face but you shouldn't be .
oh , and , uh [ chuckles ]
they asked me if ... you are as strong as you look .
and? .
i said i didn't know .
## [ ends ]
## [ resumes ]
where the hell are you , d.? .
ah , here you are .
do you wanna know what i think about it? .
well , would you show me where the bathroom is? .
i have to do a little work .
sure .
if i'm keeping you from working , i'll go .
no .
i want you to be here .
i do .
it's just a tape i need to watch .
won't take long .
do you need to hear it too? .
no .
may i keep the music? .
uh huh .
what's it about? .
some people i'm going to meet .
so then , it's what? .
it's a corporate promo? .
some kind of homework? .
homework .
yeah .
it's a good idea .
it's so important to be prepared .
oh , my god .
are you ever .
no .
no , i won't give her to you .
no .
please , just just for a little while .
no !
you're hurting me !
no , she's
she's nice .
she's okay .
i had a really terrific time last night , d.
but this morning you seem like a different person .
is something wrong? .
i have to go now .
i have to go away .
where? .
on a trip .
when will i see you again? .
reba , you have to get out .
get out now .
dear mr. graham

i hope these things might help you .
good huntin '.
byron metcalf .
## [ classical ]
mm m .
will , how many more times are we going to watch this?
see them i iving , " he said . " right in front ofyou .
it's something about these home movies .
lecter keeps saying , " you looked but didn't see .
lecter says a lot of things .
it's a sad damn thing , but we already knew that .
will , we can't afford to let lecter waste
no , no .
again .
your dissertation must be nearly finished by now , mr. crane .
nearly .
it's so nice to finally be able ... to connect a face with a name after all our correspondence .
but you know , you don't look at all like i imagined you would .
what did you think i'd look like? .
different .
## [ continues ]
right there .
there .
right there .
that's what he wanted the bolt cutter for .
to cut that padlock and go in through the basement .
but that's a different door .
i don't get it .
the one i saw was flush steel with dead bolts .
jacobi had a new door installed .
beginning of january , i think .
it's in here somewhere .
you think he cased the house while the old door was there?
he brought the bolt cutter , didn't he? .
he was sure he'd need it .
why case it almost two months in advance , then not check it again? .
i don't know , but he was ready with the bolt cutter , just like at the leeds house , only there he was ready with the glass cutter .
he must have seen the glass pane in the leedses 'kitchen door ... when he was walking through the neighborhood .
no , you can't see that door from the yard .
there's a porch lattice in the way .
jack , he knew the inside ofthe houses .
remarkable , isn't it? .
two hundred years old .
and yet so fresh , so vivid .
he almost looks alive , doesn't he? .
we just had a report here from
mr. metcalf , do you have the jacobis 'check stubs and credit card statements?
we're looking for any kind of service call or purchase ... that might have required a stranger to come into the house a repairman or a delivery guy .
yeah .
i know we already checked that , but now we've gotta go back much further .
all the way to before januart .
yeah .
no collar .
no collar .
please hurrt .
it's urgent .
metcalf says  no collar .
the dog had no collar ... in a neighborhood full of dogs , but he knew which one was their's .
same with the jacobis 'cat .
no collar , but he knew .
he knew about the padlock .
he knew about the pane of glass .
he knew the layout .
he knew how to get in .
every goddamn thing he needed to know was on this
oh , j esus .
is metcalf still on the phone? .
give me .
byron , it's graham .
hi .
you said niles jacobi took a few keepsakes .
do you have a list? .
yeah , right here .
i need to know if one of the things he tookwas a home video .
a full length v. h. s. tape compiled from shorter tapes .
one videotape .
yes? .
it says , " meet the jacobis .
it's chromalux .
we just got a fax .
an incident at the brooklyn museum .
guy attacked two employees , and get this ate the blake painting .
what? .
that's him .
it's gotta be .
if that painting meant so much to him , why destroy it? .
and why didn't he kill those two women at the museum?
they both got a good look at him .
maybe he's trying to stop .
mr. crawford , all you've got's a hunch .
i've got 382 employees , and they've got a union .
i can't just turn you guys loose in their files , not without a court order .
there are privacy issues here , the company's exposure
one of those employees has already killed 1 1 people that we know of .
if he gets away tonight , what's the company's exposure on that? .
let me get our lawyers .
you guys can work something out .
we don't have time for that .
listen to me .
we're looking for a white male , 25 to 35 .
he's right handed .
he has brown hair .
listen , please .
this guy's very strong .
he's possibly a bodybuilder .
he might have some kind official disfigurement .
he drives a van or a panel truck .
that sounds like mr. d.
oh , my god .
who's mr. d.? .
that's francis dolarhyde .
he's our manager oftechnical services .
what does he do exactly? .
he maintains the equipment for tape transfers .
would he have access to people's home videotapes? .
he has access to every tape that comes through here .
thanks for dinner , ralph , and thanks for letting me vent .
hey , look , no " problemo .
reba , listen .
i know it's not my place to say this .
go on .
well , if dolarhyde is really as moody as you say he is , maybe you ought to keep a little distance .
i mean , what do you really know about the guy? .
i appreciate your concern , ralph , really .
and i promise i'll give it some thought .
hey , have a great vacation .
thanks .
see you in a week .
good night .
i had a great time .
good night .
good night .
ralph , just 'cause i'm feeling vulnerable
reba? .
wake up .
you wandered around in the house ... while i was asleep , didn't you? .
what? .
the other night , did you find something odd? .
did you take it and show it to somebody? .
did you do that? .
d.? .
what is it? .
what's happening? .
shh !
sit still or he'll hear us .
who will? .
he's upstairs .
he he wants you , reba .
i thought he was gone , but now he's back .
d. , you're scaring me .
shh !
shh .
i didn't want to give you to him .
i did a thing for you today so he couldn't have you .
i was wrong .
you made me weak .
and then you hurt me .
no .
no , you can't have her !
d. , please don't let him have me .
you won't .
i'm for you .
you like me .
i know you like me .
take me with you .

yes .
put out your hand .
feel this .
that's a shotgun , reba .
a 1 2 gauge magnum .
do you know what it'll do? .
i wish i could have trusted you .
i wanted to trust you .
you felt so good .
so did you , d.
please don't hurt me now .
it's all over for me .
where are you , d.? .
i can't leave you to him .
do you know what he'll do? .
he'll fight you to death .
he'll hurt you so bad .
i can't let that happen .
it's better if you go with me .
yes !
god , get us out of here !
i'll shoot you and then myself .
oh , d. , no .
please .
i have to shoot you .
no !
oh , reba .
i can't do it .
i can't do it !
d. !
three steps to the clock .
from the clock to the door , nine more .
oh , god .
oh , god .
what is that?
what the hell is that?
that's the place .
oh
goddamn it !
all units , that's his house burning .
f. b. i. !
francis dolarhyde !
francis dolarhyde , where is he? .
he's in there .
he's dead .
he's dead .

he shot himself in the face .
i put my hand on it .
he set fire to the house .
he was on the floor
will , you all right?
all right , that's all i need .
but ifit's all right , i'd like to come back again before i leave to see how you're doing .
sure .
why not? .
who could resist a charmer like me? .
you know , whatever part of him was still human ... was only kept alive because of you .
you probably saved some lives .
you didn't draw a freak , okay? .
you drew a man with a freak on his back .
i should have known .
oh , no , sometimes you don't .
trust me .
i i've been there myself .
listen to me .
there was plenty wrong with dolarhyde , but there's nothing wrong with you , except your hair .
your hair is a train wreck .
can we please do something about that for next time maybe? .
please? .
that would be nice .
thank you .
just get some rest .
you're gonna be fine .
we found this in his safe .
thought you might wanna take the first look .
you've earned it .
yeah .
when i read his journal , it was sad .
it was just so sad .
i couldn't help feeling sorry for him .
he wasn't ... born a monster .
this guy was made one through years and years of abuse .
hey .
hey , dad .
can we make s'mores? .
some mores? .
yeah , s'mores .
yeah .
yeah , you're on .
all right .
go look in the pantry .
okay .
crawford .
jack , those remains you found in the rubble , they're not dolarhyde's .
what are you talking about? .
his goddamned dentures were there .
but not his bones .
wrong d. n. a.
then whose are they? .
st. louis p. d. is looking for a chromalux employee named ralph mandy .
he was supposed to be on vacation , so nobody missed him for a week .
what is taking him so long? .
are you kidding? .
it takes him 20 minutes to get out of bed in the morning .
yeah , but now i have a serious marshmallowjones .
hey , josh , what are you doing? .
we can't get to the phone , butyou know the deal .
wait for the beep .

mommy .
mommy .
my dear will
you must be healed by now , on the outside at least .
i hope you're not too ugly .
what a collection of scars you have .
never forget who gave you the best of them , and be grateful .
our scars have the power to remind us that the past was real .
we live in a primitive time , don 't we , will?
neither savage nor wise .
half measures are the curse of it .
any rational society would either kill me or put me to some use .
do you dream much , will?
i think of you often .
your old friend , hannibal lecter .
hannibal , there 's someone here to see you .
wants to ask you a few questions .
i said you'd probably refuse .
a young woman .
says she's from the f. b. i.
though she's far too pretty if you ask me .
i'll tell her you said no .
what is her name? .
