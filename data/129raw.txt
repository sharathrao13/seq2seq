for those who haven't read the plaque , we'll read the plaque .
here men from the planet earth first setfoot upon the moon .
july 1969 .
we came in peace for all mankind .
if this isn't an insanely beautiful woman , i'm hanging up .
sir , i think you should listen to this .
goddamn it !
sir?
come on , baby .
come on !
this better not be another damn russian spy job !
air traffic say the skies are clear .
it's the real thing .
a radio signal from another world .
let's not jump the gun here .
get online with space command .
they're gonna want to know ...
what's with the golf balls?
you're gonna kill me !
wait , this can't be right .
the calculated distance from source is only 375, 000km .
it's coming from the moon .
who else knows about this?
setl in new mexico identified a signal .
but , they're even more confused than we are , sir .
major !
yes , sir .
radar reception has been impaired , but we were able to get these .
we estimate that it has a diameter of over 550km and a mass roughly one fourth the size of our moon .
what the hell is it?
a meteor?
no , sir .
no , definitely not .
how do you know?
well , sir , it's slowing down .
it's what?
it's slowing down , sir .
get me the secretary of defense .
wake up him !
hello .
hi .
it's me .
hi .
what time is it there?
it's 2 . 45 in the morning .
i know i didn't wake you .
as a matter of fact , you did .
liar .
i have a confession to make .
i'm sleeping next to a beautiful , young brunette .
you didn't lether stay up watching tv?
did you?
of course not .
you're coming home
right after the luncheon?
yes , yes .
mommy?
here's your mother .
hi , honey !
i miss you .
president whitmore's approval ratings have slipped below 40 % ...
he's good .
are the salad days over for president whitmore?
leadership as a gulf war pilot is different from leadership in politics ...
daddy let me watch letterman .
traitor .
they elected a warrior and got a wimp .
morning , george .
morning , mr president .
that game couldn't have been pretty .
thank you , sir .
connie , you're up awfully early this morning .
they're not attacking your pollcies , they're attacking your age .
'please , sir , i'd like some more . " '
that's clever .
i'm not laughing .
age was not an issue when you stuck to your guns .
you were seen as young , idealistic ...
now the message has gotten lost .
it's too much politics , too much compromise .
isn't it amazing how quickly everyone can turn against you?
it's a fine line between standing behind a principle and hiding behind one .
you can tolerate a little compromise if you're managing to get something accomplished .
well , the orange county dispatch has voted you one of the ten sexiest men ofthe year .
that's accomplishing something !
mr president , it's the secretary of defense .
yes .
could you say that again?
so why are you waiting?
my social security will expire , you'll still be sitting there .
i'm thinking .
yeah , well , think already !
do you know how long it takes for those cups to decompose?
if you don't move soon , i'll start to decompose .
listen , david , i've been meaning to talk with you .
it's nice that you see me so much now ...
don't start , dad .
it's been ... what?
four years?
you're still wearing a wedding band?
three years .
you're divorced , move on .
this is not healthy .
no , the smoking is not healthy .
checkmate .
wait a minute .
wait a minute .
wait .
this is not checkmate .
see you tomorrow , pop .
hold on !
this is not checkmate .
oh ...
checkmate !
we've got everybody we have working on the problem .
i love x files too .
i hope you get to see it .
david !
what's the point in having a beeper if you don't turn it on?
i was ignoring you .
what's the big emergency?
it started this morning .
every station's making like it's the 1950s .
we got static , snow , all kinds of distortions .
nobody knows ...
there's a reason we have bins labelled " recycle " .
what the hell is going on?
my god in heaven !
so sue me .
david !
we got a problem !
did you switch transponder channels?
please !
you think i'd be this panicked if it was so simple?
ok , let's point the dish at another satellite .
we tried that .
it didn't work .
it's almost as though they weren't there .
all right .
what have we got here?
this is impossible .
the signal's all screwed up .
stop it !
just leave it alone .
you'll break it !
it's so fuzzy .
oh , no .
morning , lucas .
you see these?
i got a whole goddamn crop full ofthese .
if your father's not in the air in 20 minutes , i'm getting someone else .
russell !
hey , miguel !
russell !
what are you doing?
just what in the hell do you think you're doing?
it's the wrong field , you idiot !
lucas's farm's on the other side oftown !
are you sure?
cns is running a story that we're covering up a nuclear testing experiment .
they can run with it if they want to embarrass themselves .
nasa wants to know our position .
our official position is we have no official position .
what is going on here?
guys , would i keep you out ofthe loop?
absolutely .
what?
i can't hear you .
at the moment our satellites are somewhat unreliable .
isn't it possible that this thing mayjust pass us by?
what if it doesn't?
why don't we target some icbms to blow it up?
and risk turning one dangerous falling object into many?
we don't yet know enough to make any kind of intelligen tjudgments .
luckily the press is making up their own story for now .
but that's not gonna keep .
we may need to upgrade to defcon 3 .
absolutely .
general , tell norad we're on defcon 3 .
that's not what the president said .
isn't that a bit premature?
over 50 % of the armed forces are on weekend leave .
plus the commanders and troops that are in town for the fourth of july parade .
the object has settled into a stationary orbit .
well , that's good news .
not really , sir .
part of it has broken off into nearly three dozen pieces .
smaller than the whole , yet over 15 miles in width themselves .
where are they heading?
they should be entering our atmosphere within the next 25 minutes .
take us to defcon 3 .
please say we're gettin 'somewhere .
there's good and bad news .
what's the bad news?
there's a penalty for disturbing my lunch .
and the good news is you won't charge me .
no .
the good news is that the problem is not our equipment , but a weird signal embedded in the satellite feed .
that's the good news?
yes .
it has a sequential pattern .
once i find the exact binary sequence ,
i can calculate the phase reversal and apply it .
we should be able to block it out .
and then we'll be the only guys in town with a clear picture !
yes !
yes !
david !
that's why i love you !
that's not necessary .
too kind .
this had better be good .
admiral on deck !
sir , we're looking at a total radar blackout over a 13km area .
let's do a diagnostic check .
excuse me , sir .
the radar may be malfunctioning , but the infrared is totally off the map .
jeez !
get me atlantic command on line .
hang on , sir .
sir , we have visual range with incoming over iraql air space .
second sighting?
yes , sir .
just came in from the persian gulf .
correction , sir .
we have two confirmed visual contacts .
mr president , they're tracking another one off the california coastline !
all right , put it on .
general , you might wanna watch this .
ladies and gentlemen , we are interrupting ourregularbroadcast to bring you extraordinary events taking place in russia .
this unexplained disturbance and the resulting hysteria are incredible .
how would you describe what you are seeing?
it is clearing the mountains , moving too slowly to be a comet ormeteor .
widespread panic has gripped the countryside as thousands have taken to the streets .
it is confirmed .
the unexplained phenomenon is headed for moscow .
we have an awac offthe west coast .
eta with contact point , three minutes .
don't understand it , sir .
side radar doesn't see a thing .
i know !
i'm blind , sir .
nothing is registering .
negative .
we have zero visibility .
visibility is at zero .
command , this is eagle eye 370 .
captain , the president is listening .
repeat what you just told me .
we still have zero visibility .
lnstrumentation is malfunctioning .
we can't get any kind of reading on what's in front of us .
wait a minute .
it maybe clearing .
pull out !
line's gone , sir .
two more spotted over the atlantic .
one's moving toward new york , the other here .
how long do we have?
less than 10 minutes .
mr president , i recommend we move you to a secure location .
connie , can we expect the same panic?
more than likely .
we can discuss this on the way .
i'm not leaving .
we have to maintain a working government .
take the vice president , the whole cabinet , and the joint chiefs to a secured location .
i'm staying .
i don't want to add to a public hysteria that's gonna cost lives .
connie , we'll initiate the emergency broadcast system .
we'll advise people not to panic .
the best idea right now is to stay in their homes .
yes , sir .
roy?
dean?
have the cabinet members rendez vous here .
we'll take them to norad .
mr president , with your permission , i'd like to remain at your side .
i had a feeling you would .
what happens if they do become hostile?
then god help us .
there it is .
the strange atmospheric phenomenon .
it is apparently what is causing all the distortions ...
david , are you watching this?
there is no evidence that these phenomena are endangering anyone .
thus far , reports of oppression ...
marty , i got a lock on that signal pattern so we can filter it out .
but if my calculations are right , it'll be gone in seven hours .
it's reducing itself every time it recycles so eventually it'll disappear .
are you listening?
can you believe this?
haven't you been watching?
david !
good afternoon .
so far the phenomenon has not caused any damage .
we have to ask you to stay calm , and it's important for everyone not to panic .
we have a fix on three of the occurrences about to appear ...
it's just unreal .
miguel , come here !
one is headed towards los angeles .
the other two are headed towards new york and washington , dc .
marty .
jamie says this building has an old bomb shelter .
we're heading down there now .
everybody !
head down to the basement .
take it slow , don't run .
walk down to the basement !
there's no shame in hiding .
i'd better call my mother .
well , look who we have here .
russ , i heard you had a little trouble this morning .
dusted the wrong field .
i know you're probably still a little confused from your hostage experience .
hostage experience?
did something happen to you , russ?
years back he was kidnapped by aliens .
did all kind of experiments on him and such .
tell'em about it , russ .
get a few beers in him and he'll tell you all about it .
won't you , russ?
russ , when they took you up in their spaceship , did they do any ... .. sexual things?
do you recall?
do you recollect?
what's that?
let's get outta here .
wow !
mommy , look it !
it's too early , baby .
ls it an earthquake?
not even a four pointer .
go back to sleep .
daddy !
what are you doing here?
you should be in the shelter .
what's going on?
aren't you coming , david?
i gotta see this .
the signal !
my god !
now what do we do?
address the nation .
there's gonna be a lot of frightened people out there .
yeah .
i'm one of 'em .
hey !
come on !
he's just trying to impress you .
lf you wanna impress me , you need to get a job and stop slobberin 'all over my shoes .
i don't believe this .
jasmine !
neighbours are movin 'out .
i guess they finally got tired of all these quakes .
a little shake and they runnin '.
police and fire departments want everyone to stay off the phone .
there's something on the news about the quake !
what's up , man?
what you doin 'goin 'out there?
shooting aliens .
oh , you shootin 'aliens .
you think you're tough , huh?
what you got?
turn around .
come on , let's get you something to eat .
watch out !
watch it now !
i'm gonna go grab the paper .
dylan !
come on , honey .
let's go !
babe , you want some ofthis coffee?
babe?
pentagon offilcials are warning more ships have arrived over the capitals of india , englandand germany , bringing estimates up to between 10 and 15 of these city size spacecraft .
i know , ma .
just try and stay calm .
tell her to leave town .
why?
what happened?
just do it !
ma , listen !
get your stuff together and head for aunt esther's .
don't argue with me !
just go !
david !
why did i just send my mother to atlanta?
david , talk to me .
the signal in the satellite feed is recycling down to extinction .
didn't you hear me?
not really .
countdown .
a countdown?
to what , david?
it's like in chess .
first you strategically position your pieces .
then , when the timing's right , you strike .
see?
they're positioning themselves everywhere using one signal to synchronise their efforts .
ln about six hours , the signal's gonna disappear and the countdown will be over .
and then what?
checkmate .
oh , my god !
oh , my god , i gotta call my brother .
i'd better call my housekeeper , and my lawyer !
ah , forget my lawyer .
ladies and gentlemen , the president ofthe united states .
good afternoon .
my fellow americans , a historic and unprecedented event has occurred .
the question of whether or not we're alone in the universe has been answered .
although it's understandable that many of us feel hesitation or fear , we must attempt to reserve judgment .
he says he's your husband .
oh , god .
what do you want?
you gotta leave the white house .
this is hardly the time to be having that old discussion .
you gotta leave washington .
ln case you haven't noticed , we are having a little crisis here !
they have a hidden signal .
they're gonna attack .
you are just being paranoid !
it's not paranoia !
the embedding's very subtle .
it was probably overlooked ...
marty , get out oftown as soon as you can .
please?
the staff and i will remain here as we attempt to communicate .
if you feel compelled to leave these cities , please do so in an orderly fashion .
excuse me !
coming through .
the arrival of the aliens has caused over 10, 000 fender benders in just a few seconds .
but this is just the beginning ...
you can't go !
you got to call them back !
i'm not gonna do this with you , jasmine .
i've got to report to el toro .
you said you was on leave for the fourth !
well , they cancelled it !
look , why are you acting like this?
why?
that's why !
look , i really don't think they flew 90 billion light years to come and start a fight , and get all rowdy .
why don't you just relax?
i'm gonna report to el toro , find out what's goin 'on .
what are you doin 'in there , man?
nothing , i'm just drivin '.
look .
i got these for you .
firecrackers !
you be careful .
steve , wait .
i wanna tell you something .
what is it , jasmine?
you take care of yourself , you hear?
look , why don't you pack some things and you and dylan come stay with me on the base?
you will see that there is nothing to be scared of .
really?
you don't mind?
well , i mean ...
i will have to let all my other girlfriends know they can't come over .
i got to postpone a freaky weekend .
there you go , thinking you're all that .
but you are not as charming as you think you are , sir .
yes , i am .
them big old dumbo ears .
look at you with them chicken legs .
come on , dylan .
look out !
the television said they started looting .
vultures .
do you still have the plymouth?
david , you don't have a licence .
you're driving .
yeah , i'm ...
i'm driving?
come on .
i really want you out of los angeles .
you're staying there to keep people calm .
i won't let them criticise you for it .
i appreciate your trying to help me .
liar .
stick to the truth .
you're good at it .
ok .
i don't want you in any one ofthose cities .
i'll leave as soon as the interviews are done .
all right .
a helicopter will be taking you to nullius .
and the munchkin?
she'll meet you there .
all right .
i love you .
i love you .
bye .
bye .
it 's the white house !
you can't drive up and ring a bell .
can't you go any faster?
you think they don't know what you know?
she works for the president .
they know everything .
they don't know this .
you're gonna educate them , huh?
so are you so smart?
how come you spent eight years in mlt to become a cable repairman?
all i'm saying is they got people who handle these things .
if they want hbo , they'll call you .
look at these people , look .
vultures .
they take and then they go .
they're going faster than we are .
we're in the fast lane !
they're cutting me off .
no one's cutting you off !
they're getting in front .
i can't go faster .
i don't wanna argue .
let's just get there , quickly .
what's the rush?
you think we'll get to washington and it won't be there?
a crop duster was arrested as he dropped leaflets from the air .
everybody's leavin '.
can you give us some ofyour time?
we've got to stop them ! i was kidnapped by space aliens ten years ago !
they did all kinds of experiments on me !
they've been studying us , finding out our weaknesses !
we've gotta stop 'em .
they're gonna kill us all !
some people attribute his behaviour to post traumatic stress from his service as a pilotin vietnam .
others have a more unusual theory .
how would you describe mr casse?
keeps to himself .
quiet .
private .
when they took him up in the spaceship , the aliens abused him sexually .
mr casse is in the county lockup ...
pack up .
we're leaving .
he maybe released later tonight ...
miguel , what about dad?
this could be our last night on earth .
you don't wanna die a virgin , do you?
come on !
we're going .
no , i'm not goin 'anywhere .
miguel !
stop it !
thanks a lot , partner !
you read my mind !
stay here .
we gotta get as far away from these things as we can !
they let you out?
you damn right !
they got bigger fish to fry now , believe you me !
come on , boy !
we're leavin 'without you .
we're goin 'to live with uncle hector in tucson .
hector !
like hell you are !
i'm still your father .
no , you're not .
you're just the man who married my mother .
you're nothin 'to me !
well , what about troy?
troy?
yeah .
for once in your life , why don't you think about what's best for him?
who has to beg for money to buy him medicine when you screw up?
huh?
who?
who? !
you stop it right now !
i'm not a baby any more !
i don't want your stupid medicine because i'm so sick of medicine !
do you know what this stuff costs?
do you wanna get sick again?
do you?
the lapd is asking los angelenos not to fire their guns at the visitor spacecraft .
you may inadvertently trigger an interstellar war .
do you think we can find something better to do with our time?
where you been , stevie?
man , this is unbelievable .
this is , like , huge .
they've recalled everybody .
looks like the mail's still working .
you'll have to do the honours for me .
you're a wuss !
whatever .
shut up and read it .
captain steven hiller " ... loser .
come on !
blah blah blah !
we regret to inform you that despite your excellent record of service ...
i'm sorry , man .
you know what you need to do?
you need to , like , kiss some serious booty to get ahead in this world .
that's what i'm trying to tell you .
see , i like the one knee approach , because it puts the booty , like , right in front of the lip ...
what's this?
that's nothin '.
what is this?
jasmine kinda has a thing for dolphins .
stevie , this is a wedding ring .
i thought you said you were gonna break it off?

... lt could only happen in california .
here's wendy walsh with a special report .
hundreds of ufo fanatics have gathered on rooftops in los angeles to welcome the newarrivals .
oh , god !
i hope they bring back elvis !
i just came in to get my check tonight and i got talked into working .
oh , i must have been trippin '.

tiffany , listen to me a sec .
i've got a really bad feeling about this .
i don't want you to go .
oh , like the really bad feeling you got when i went to las vegas?
and i was right .
you didn't get the job and you lost all your money gambling .
yeah , but i wasn't in la for the earthquake .
tiff , i really don't want you to go up there .
now promise me you won't .

you're fired .
nice workin 'with you , mario .
come on , boomer .
everyone is trying to get out of washington .
we're the only schmucks trying to get in .
what the hell's that?
part of any phone books of amerikans .
you think a important person like constance are in listing?
she always keeps her portable phone listed for emergencies .
sometimes it's her first initial , sometimes her nickname .
sometimes just her ...
oy , my god !
hey , hey , hey !
slow down !
pit stops !
tell them !
slow down !
a ramp !
slow down !
we made it !
good .
nice drivin ', pops .
well ...
so , not listed , huh?
no , no .
i just haven't found it yet .
i tried c. spano , connie spano , spunky spano .
spunky?
college nickname .
cute .
you tried levinson?
she didn't take my name .
why would she ...
what do you mean?
try it .
here .
look .
so what do i know?
hm?
so?
do you wanna ring the bell , or should i?
perfect , she's using it .
what?
it's busy?
yeah , i can use her signal to triangulate her exact position in the white house .
you can do that?
yeah .
all cable repairmen can , pops .
the visitors have arrived , but the president remains at the white house .
question .
are mr whitmore's actions a ) ultra brave or b ) foolhardy?
what?
don't hang up , sweetie .
david !
how did you get this number?
do me a favour .
walk to the window .
and i'm looking for what?
you'll see .
over here .
see us?
how does he do that?
ln light of our apparent inability to communicate with the visitors
pentagon officials have retrofit this skylift helicopter with a visual communications device .
mr president .
gentlemen , be seated .
where are we now?
we're commencing lift off . .. and refitted with these enormous light panels that are attached to the hull and onto the sides .
echo one , welcome wagon is in the air .
i repeat , welcome wagon is in the air .
roger , welcome wagon .
echo one , right beside you .
this is something i would never believe that i would be !
in the white house !
if i knew i was gonna meet the president , i would have worn a tie .
look at me , i look like a schlemiel .
oy , my god !
david ,
i don't know if he'll want to see you .
then we're wasting time , we should go .
why wouldn't he listen?
last time i saw him , we had a fight .
you walked in and punched him in the head .
the president !
he wasn't president then .
i punched him , he fought back .
it was a fight !
a fight that you started !
david thought i was having an affair .
with the president?
which i wasn't !
either go get him , or we should head back .
all right , i'll get him .
wait here , and don't touch anything !
you punched the president?
god !
nearing point of contact , echo one .
we're closing in .
roger that .
begin sequence when ready .
this i like .
look at this !
you know what famous people have been here?
hm?
politicians , actors , baseball players , singers ...
and now me !
imagine that !
a poor immigrant like me .
" it's a dream !
sh !
david !
the three choppers are approaching what has been unanimously agreed to be the front ofthese spaceships ...
you're leaving now?
hey , see if they've got those pens they give away .
dad , what?
i don't have a choice ...
i don't have time for this .
two minutes , tom , please .
mr president , julius levinson .
david is my ...
i told you he wouldn't listen .
you have to tell him now .
david , you have to tell him !
david , tell him !
i know why we have satellite disruption .
all right .
go ahead .
let's say that you wanted to coordinate with spaceships on different sides ofthe earth .
they couldn't send a direct signal , right?
you mean line of sight?
right .
the curve of the earth prevents it .
you'd need satellites to relay that signal in order to reach each ship .
well , i found a signal hidden inside our own satellite system .
excuse me , mr president .
they're starting .
they're using our own satellites against us .
the clock is ticking .
bringing it in to hover .
welcome wagon ,
echo one .
approaching alien ship .
initiating communication sequence .
welcome wagon has commenced .
general grey , coordinate with the atlantic command .
tell them to evacuate the cities .
get those helicopters away from the ship .
call them back !
what the hell's going on?
we're leaving .
kim !
my daughter .
something's happening .
they're responding .
it looks like there's activity .
this may be a response , echo one .
we see it too .
can't identify it .
we are evacuating .
i repeat , we are evacuating the white house .
load the rest of the staff in the second helicopter .
is my wife in the air?
she will be shortly .
nice .
very nice .
good !
close the door !
hatch secure !
we have our own phone .
move outta here .
the president's ordered an evacuation .
our prayers go out to the pilots 'families .
indeed , god help us all .
mrs whitmore .
the visitors responded with terrifying ...
authorities have called for the evacuation of los angeles county .
people are advised to avoid the highways wherever possible .
great !
now he tells me .
this is the los angeles police department .
please vacate the premises immediately for your own safety .
can we move it along?
dr katz's offilce .
hello .
dr katz , please .
i'm sorry , he's not available .
for $300 an hour , you can put me through to his house in the hamptons !
this is the los angeles police department .
please vacate the premises immediately for your own safety .
mrs whitmore !
you must leave now .
the first lady's secured .
we're on the move .
they're opening up !
it's so pretty .
get the hell outta here !
go ahead , pilot .
we're ready to take off right now .

time's up .
oh , crap .
oh , my god !
come on , dylan !
we gotta go !
come on , boomer !
boomer !
reports are unclear as to the extent of the devastation , but it appears that los angeles , washington , and new york are in ruins .
good god !
i've been sayin 'it .
i've been sayin 'it for ten damn years !
ain't i , miguel?
huh?
i've been sayin 'it !
dad , i don't feel good .
pull it over , man .
we're gonna be all right , troy .
yeah , leave me alone .
i got it .
miguel !
look at all that .
we could have evacuated the cities hours ago .
that's the advantage of being a fighter pilot .
ln the gulf war , we knew what we had to do .
this is just ... .. not simple any more .
a lot of people died today .
how many didn't have to?
any news on my wife yet?
the helicopter never made it to nullius .
no radio contact .
come on , dylan .
stay close .
here it is .
what happened , mommy?
i don't know , baby .
you men will be the first wave in our counter attack .
our target is to the north , centred above what remains of downtown los angeles .
our black knight squadron ...
are you scared , man?
nope .
you?
nope .
hold me !
hey , pay attention .
something you wanna add , captain hiller?
no , sir .
just a little anxious to whup et's ass , that's all .
you'll get your chance .
you'll all get your chance .
good hunting .
dismissed !
let's kick the tyres and light the fires , big daddy !
ready to go , sir !
let's bring it home .
bring that bad boy home , captain !
you loose?
yes , sir !
got your victory dance?
oh , i got it right here ... yeah !
hey , don't get pre patrol on me .
we don't light up till the fat lady sings .
i'm all ears , brother !
you the man !
all right , gentlemen , we're on .
general , it's norad .
general grey here .
al?
all communications with the cities are down .
all systems gone .
for intelligence , we believe it's a total loss .
how about our boys?
where are they?
eta to target , four minutes .
i shouldn't have left her .
don't worry about it , big man .
i'm sure she got outta here before it happened .
why we're on this particular mission , we'll never know .
but i do know , here today , that the black knights will emerge victorious once again .
amen , man !
amen , reverend .
holy god !
lock and load !
roger that .
la attack squadron has amraam missiles locked on target .
washington and new york squadrons report lock on .
fire at will .
fire at will .
knights , we are red and free .
knight one , fox three !
knight three , fox three !
knight seven , fox three .
the missiles have been fired .
are they not getting through?
no , not one .
command , knight one .
switchin 'to sidewinders , moving in .
knight three , low 50 knots reference 120 .
knight seven , 120 .
knight one , sweep lock .
fox two .
knight seven ...
come on !
they must have a protective shield over the hull !
knights , pull up !
knight three , pull up !
complete failure in the stators !

too many of 'em !
they got another one , sir .
oh no , you did not shoot that green shit at me !
i got ya covered , big daddy !
damn , they got shields , too !
let's go , knights !
move , knights !
move !
jesus !
they got another one .
and two more .
they're dropping like flies .
we're losing it .
get 'em outta there .
squadron leaders , retreat to fallback position .
abort mission right away !
we'll have to make a run for this one !
let's get low and fast !
i gotcha , big daddy !
let's get 'em !
watch the deck !
squadron leader , abort !
this isn't happening fast enough !
get 'em out !
the monitor !
where's the picture?
we've lost the satellite .
we got two on our six , jimmy .
shackle !
roger .
come on , come on !
move !
you told me , like , quite all right !
they ain't got nothin 'for us !
let's push it !
i can't shake 'em .
yes , you can .
just the way i showed you .
i'm gonna try somethin '.
nothin 'stupid !
you know me !
that's what i mean .
jimmy , you can't bank at that speed !
jimmy , he's closing on you !
put your mask back on !
that's an order !
i can't breathe !
jimmy !
no !
affirmative .
we have incoming .
let me have it , son .
you got it .
friendly?
sergeant?
i don't think so .
come on and get me !
what are you shooting at?
where you at , baby? !
come on !
you can't hit nothin '!
low bridge !
see if you can fly that thing under cover !
hope you got an airbag !
son of a bitch !
this way !
this way !
get off !
get off of me !
that's what you'll get !
look at you !
ship all banged up !
who's the man? !
huh?
who's the man? !
wait till i get another plane !
i'm linin 'all your friends up , right beside you !
where you at?
huh?
where you at?
welcome to earth .
that's what i call close contact .
baby , stay right here with boomer .
keys .
come on , keys .
yes !
come , baby .
come on !
reports indicate that this battle has repeated itself all over the world with the same results .
you're just like your mother , you know that?
she was stubborn , too .
i had to twist her arm to get her to take her medicine .
you're gonna be all right .
you're gonna be fine .
see , troy?
you're feelin 'better already .
i couldn't find anything .
everyone's packin 'up .
they said a spaceship is headed this way .
we'd better leave , too , then .
everyone's packin 'up .
penicillin .
it'll help keep his fever down .
thank you .
it's really nice of you to help us .
i wish i could do more , but we're moving out .
i'm going with you .
well , i just mean that we're going , too .
cool .
tell that punk to shut the door , we're outta here .
he can sniff around somewhere else .
it's air force one , for crying out loud .
still he gets sick .
i don't feel too good .
look at me , huh?
like a rock .
could be bad weather or good weather .
we could go up or down , back or forwards , side to side ...
what did i say?
he still gets airsick , huh?
yeah .
julius , with all of this ...
i didn't get a chance to thank you two .
all he could think of was getting to you .
there's still love there , i think .
love was never a problem .
all you need is love .
john lennon .
smart man .
shot in the back , very sad .
we've moved as many of our forces away from our bases as possible .
but we've already sustained heavy losses .
i spoke with the joint chiefs at norad .
they agree we must counterattack with a full nuclear strike .
over american soil?
you're saying we should sacrifice more innocent american civilians?
if we don't strike soon , there may not be much of an america left !
sir !
they've taken out norad .
what?
it's gone , sir .
my god !
the vice president?
the joint chiefs?
mr president .
we must launch .
a delay would be more costly than when you waited to evacuate the cities .
you're not gonna launch nuclear weapons .
you'll kill them and us .
if we fire nukes ...
sir , may i remind you you are a guest here?
you ever hear of nuclear winter?
it's the end of life as we know it .
just go .
i don't have to go .
it can't be allowed !
shut up !
captain , get him out !
don't tell him to shut up !
you'd all be dead if it wasn't for my david !
none of you did anything to prevent this !
there was nothing we could do .
we were totally unprepared for this .
don't give me that !
come on .
it was , what?
ln the 1950s , you had that spaceship .
dad .
look ...
yeah , that thing you found in new mexico !
where was that?
not the spaceship .
roswell , new mexico .
you had the spaceship and the bodies !
they were locked up in a bunker .
where was that?
david !
area 51 .
right?
area 51 .
you knew then !
and you did nothing .
sir .
regardless of what you may have read in the tabloids , there have never been any spacecraft recovered by our government .
take my word for it .
there's no area 51 .
and there's no recovered spaceship .
excuse me , mr president ...
that's not entirely accurate .
hold on , everybody .
hold on !
sorry .
the end hath come !
he's spaken his word and the end hath come !
hop on !
we're headin 'out to el toro !
you cannot defy what hath come !
it's the end !
el toro? !
can you give me a hand?
sure .
oh , god .
ok , let's get this off .
here , let me help you .
she's hurt pretty badly .
you know , this was supposed to be my weekend off .
but , nooo !
you got me out here , draggin 'your heavy ass through the burnin 'desert with your dreadlocks stickin 'out the back of my parachute .
you gotta come down here with an attitude , actin 'all big and bad .
and what the hell is that smell?
i coulda been at a barbecue !
but i ain't mad .
it's all right , it's all right .
do you need a lift , soldier?
when i flew overhead , i saw a base not too far from here .
it ain't on the map .
trust me , it's there .
attention !
mr president .
general .
welcome to area 51 .
please follow me .
we're now 24 floors beneath the surface and here's our main research facility .
let's see it .
sorry , sir , it's a clean room .
it's static free ...
open the door .
yes , sir .
my god .
why the hell wasn't i told about this place?
two words , mr president .
plausible deniability .
i don't get it .
where does all this come from?
how do you get funding for something like this?
you don't actually think they spend $20, 000 on a hammer , $30, 000 on a toilet seat , do you?
mr president , this is dr okun .
he has headed up the research department on this project for the last 15 years .
how do you do?
mr president !
wow !
this ...
what a pleasure !
as you can imagine , they ...
they don't let us out much .
i can understand that .
well !
i guess you'd like to see the big tamale , huh?
follow me .
she's a beaut , ain't she?
as you can see from the repairs , we've been trying to put her back together since the '60s .
you've had this for 40 years and you know nothing about 'em?
oh , hell , no .
we know tons about 'em .
but the neatest stuff ...
the neatest stuff has only happened in the last few days .
we can't duplicate their type of power so we've never been able to experiment .
but since these guys started showing up , all the little gizmos inside turned on .
the last 24 hours have been really exciting !
exciting?
people are dying out there .
exciting isn't the word i'd choose to describe it !
you're hoping to fly this thing , huh?
you said you can repair their technology .
can you tell us anything useful about them?
yeah .
well , i mean ...
they're not all that dissimilar from us .
breathes oxygen , comparable tolerances to heat , cold .
probably why they're interested in our planet .
hey ...
you guys wanna see 'em?
this is ...
this is the vault .
or , as some of us have come to call it ... .. the freak show .
when we found 'em , they were wearing some sort of biomechanical suits .
once we got 'em off , we learned a great deal about their anatomy .
eyes , ears .
no vocal chords .
we assume they communicate with each other by some other means .
you're obviously not thinking about hand signals and body language .
it's some kind of extrasensory perception .
telepathy .
so ...
it's an organic life form .
can they be killed?
their bodies are just as frail as ours .
these two died in the crash .
this one a few weeks later .
you just have to get through their technology , which is ,
i'm sorry to say , far more advanced .
david , you unlocked part of their technology .
you cracked the code .
no , no .
all i did was stumble on their ... .. signal .
i don't know how helpful i can be .
why don't you show him what you've discovered so far?
figure out what they haven't thought of yet .
we'll see if you're as smart as we all hope you are .
what code?
captain steven hiller , us marine corps .
i'm sorry , captain .
you don't have clearance .
ok .
come here .
you wanna see my clearance?
maybe i'll just leave this here with you .
let 'em pass .
get the hell out of the way !
did you see that?
come on down .
watch your step .
well , obviously this cockpit was designed to seat three .
though how they sat on them , i don't know .
gently .
you see these gizmos flashing?
we've been workin 'around the clock trying to get a fix on all this .
some stuff we figured out right away .
this we're pretty sure is the life support for the cabin .
and this doohickey is connected to ...
oh ...
well , it was connected to the engine .
here , take that , will ya?
these configurations ...
well , to be honest , we don't know what the hell this crap is .
but this is clearly what they use to guide and navigate their craft .
neat , huh?
could somebody grab my laptop there?
can i have the computer inside?
these patterns are repeating sequentially , like their countdown signal .
they're using that frequency for computer communications .
see?
that's how they're coordinating their ships .
you know ...
you're really starting to make us look bad .
they got one !
they got one alive !
they got one .
alive !
jesus !
you'll be ok by yourself , dave?
fine .
don't touch anything .
everybody's always telling me not to touch anything .
oh !
it's all wet .
right here !
in the back of the pickup .
general , sir .
captain steven hiller , united states marine corps .
guess who's comin 'to dinner !
i need a doctor .
i need a doctor !
oh , boy !
how long has he been unconscious?
about three hours .
let's get him in containment .
my son is very sick .
he needs attention !
he's drying out .
i want him sprayed down with saline .
he has a problem with his adrenal cortex !
please !
if you don't do something right now , my son will die !
just help him !
okay .
o'haver , miller , you come with us .
you , take us to him , ok?
let's go .
all right .
move it !
as the former head of the cla , you knew about this place .
when were you planning to inform us?
it had been deemed classified .
you should have told us about this when they first arrived !
we wouldn't have launched a counterattack that cost the lives of hundreds of our pilots !
we could not have known that our fighters would've been that ineffective !
mr president .
the little bit of information we have comes directly into this room .
atlanta , chicago , and philadelphia .
destroyed .
nato and western allied installations were the first to be taken out .
then we were hit .
they knew exactly where and how to hit us .
and our forces?
we're down to 15 % .
if you calculate the time it takes to destroy a city and move on , we're looking at the worldwide destruction of every major city in the next 36 hours .
we're being exterminated .
mr president !
this is captain steven hiller .
captain .
mr president .
well done .
where is it now?
it's isolated in the containment lab , sir .
i'd like to go see it .
general , i'm really anxious to get back to el toro .
hasn't anyone told you?
el toro has been completely destroyed .
we were lucky .
today was the first time i used the subway .
thank god for the metro rail .
these should last us a while .
don't move .
i'll get it for you .
stay still .
he's your son?
he's my angel .
was his father stationed here?
nah , he ...
he wasn't his father .
but i was kinda hopin 'he wanted the job , though .
so what do you do for a living?
i'm a dancer .
ballet .
no .
exotic .
sorry .
don't be .
i'm not .
it's good money .
besides my baby's worth it .
dylan !
come here .
i want you to meet the first lady .
hello .
hi .
i didn't know that you'd recognised me .
well , i didn't want to say nothin '.
i voted for the other guy .
life support monitors recording .
so if we screw up , it's all on tape .
come on .
let's get this biomechanical suit off .
put the spreader right here , along the ridge .
microprobe thing a majig goes right here .
pick there .
good .
all right , now spread it very , very gently .
let me get in .
gentle , gentle , that's it .
run this right in ...
all right .
let's proceed .
now comes the really icky part .
oh , boy .
this is one smelly , disgusting ...
look at it .
it doesn't look alive , does it?
the arm is moving .
doctor?
doctor?
doctor?
don't move !
dr okun?
release me .
open the door .
get him out !
no , wait .
release me .
i know there is much we can learn from each other if we can negotiate a truce .
we can find a way to coexist .
can there be a peace between us?
peace .
no peace .
what is it you want us to do?
die .
die !
mr president .
is that glass bulletproof?
no , sir .
are you all right?
i saw his thoughts .
i saw what they're planning to do .
they're like locusts .
they're moving from planet to planet .
their whole civilisation .
after they've consumed every natural resource , they move on .
and we're next .
nuke 'em .
let's nuke the bastards .
just my luck .
no ice .
i take it you've heard?
hey , toast .
to the end of the world .
he didn't come to this decision lightly .
he didn't have any other choice .
well , you still believe in him .
well , he's a good man .
he'd better be .
you left me for him .
or , you know ... for your career .
you know , it wasn't just my career .
it was the biggest opportunity of my life .
i wanted my life to make a difference .
i wanted my life to mean something .
and ...
i wasn't ... ambitious enough for you?
david , you could have done anything you wanted .
research , development ...
i was happy where i was .
haven't you ever wanted to be part of something special?
i was part of something special .
well , if it makes any difference , i never stopped loving you .
but that wasn't enough , was it?
let's pick it up , man .
let's go !
let's pick it up , man !
we're on a tight schedule !
pick it up , man !
pick it up !
what the hell are you doin '?
get outta there !
i got something i gotta handle .
i'm borrowin 'it .
no , you're not , sir .
do you really wanna shoot me?
just tell 'em i hit you .
command , this is retal op.
squadron is in the air .
we are on station and awaiting instructions .
break formation .
head to targets .
sir .
they're breaking formation .
we're initiating sequence code .
alpha zulu six eight niner .
which city will be reached first?
houston , texas .
eta , six minutes and counting down .
houston .
the major cities have been deserted .
civilian casualties should be down to a minimum .
command , this is neighbourhood watch .
we are in position .
tracking monitors are locked on .
we are going to visual recon .
roger .
we have confirmation .
launch code confirmed .
alpha zulu six eight niner , standing by .
laser targeting .
locked on .
we're locked on , sir .
do you wish to deploy?
mr president , if you wish to deploy , the time is now .
mr president?
deploy .
that's a go .
alpha zulu six eight niner .
here we go .
bird's away .
we have visual confirmation of the missile .
it's on target .
approaching .
may our children forgive us .
five seconds to impact .
three , two , one .
it's a hit !
get down !
get down !
can we confirm that the target was destroyed?
get the tank commander .
confirm the target was destroyed .
red arrow , alpha 9723 .
can you read?
repeat .
you're breaking up .
we have lost visual .
roger that .
we're looking for confirmation .
we got the bastards .
good job , everyone !
congratulations .
commander , do you have visual?
we need visual confirmation .
has the target been destroyed?
negative .
target remains .
i repeat , target remains .
call the other planes back .
the others might have more luck .
we shouldn't give up !
i said call them back !
abort .
abort mission .
lssue the abort codes right away .
this is an abort , full abort .
do you read?
jasmine !
you're late !
you know i like to make an entrance .
where are we going?
through there , sir .
mr president .
your wife is resting comfortably for the moment .
perhaps if we had gotten to her earlier ...
hey , there she is !
go on !
she doesn't look too good .
your wife is bleeding internally .
perhaps if we'd gotten to her earlier ...
what are you saying?
we can't stop the bleeding .
lf we'd ...
there's nothing we can do for her .
we were worried .
we didn't know where you were .
you've gotten bigger , i think .
i did?
you just keep growing and growing .
i can't ...
hey .
can you wait outside for a little bit so mom can get a rest?
come on , munchkin .
i'm so sorry that i didn't come home when you asked me to .
it's ok .
the doctors ... .. think that you're ... gonna be just fine .
liar .
ls mommy sleeping now?
yeah .
mommy's sleeping .
david !
what the hell are you doing?
i'm makin 'a mess !
yeah .
this i can see .
we gotta burn this toxic waste , pollute the air and rip up the ozone !
cos maybe if we screw this planet up enough ... .. they won't want it any more .
wait .
david .
don't do this to yourself .
listen to me .
i'm listening .
everyone loses faith at some point in their life .
even myself .
i haven't spoken to god since your mother died .
you see , sometimes we have to remember what we still have .
like what?
well , you still have your health .
david , you need your rest .
come on !
get off this freezing floor before you catch cold .
come on !
what did you just say?
about faith?
well , you see , a man ...
no .
the other part .
what?
i don't want you to catch cold .
what is that?
what is the matter with you?
genius .
genius?
my dad .
a total genius .
jerry , wake up .
we got work to do .
get everybody down here right away .
look at that !
wow !
does that thing really fly in outer space?
it most certainly does .
sure doesn't look like it .
they're here .
all right , what's this all about?
i have no idea .
get everybody off .
right , clear the platform .
let's go .
major mitchell .
do you have a pistol?
what?
have you got a gun?
sergeant , your sidearm .
see that coke can on top of the alien craft?
think you can shoot that thing off?
shoot it .
sir?
go ahead .
what the hell are you doing?
i'm sorry .
my fault .
that coke can was protected by the craft's shield .
we can't penetrate it .
what's your point?
my point is , if we can't beat their defences , then we gotta get around them .
major .
one more time ...
any time .
how did you do that?
i gave it a cold .
i gave it a virus .
a computer virus .
are you telling us you can send out a signal that will disable all their shields?
just like they used our satellites against us , we can use their own signal against them .
lf we plant a virus into that mother ship , it's gonna filter down into all the corresponding ships below .
i'm sorry .
i don't understand .
how exactly do we infect the mother ship with this virus?
we're ...
we're gonna have to ... fly their alien craft out of our atmosphere and dock with it .
we can enter here , as shown in these satellite photos .
we then upload the virus , set off some kind of explosion which'll disable it .
that'll disorient the smaller ships below and that could buy you some time to ... to take 'em ... take 'em out .
take 'em down .
do your ...
do your stuff .
this is ridiculous !
how long would their shields be down?
eh ...
i dunno .
a matter of minutes .
you want us to coordinate a counterstrike with a window of a few minutes?
with shields down , it might be possible .
oh , please !
we don't have the manpower or the resources to launch that kind of a campaign !
not to mention that this whole cockamamie plan depends on a machine that no one in this world is qualified to operate .
i wouldn't say that , sir .
i've seen them in action .
i'm aware of their manoeuvring capabilities .
with your permission , general , i'd like the opportunity to try .
that thing is a wreck .
it crash landed in the '50s .
we don't even know if it's capable of flying !
jim , remove the clamps .
any questions?
let's do it .
all right , you heard the president ...
good luck , pilot .
thank you , mr president .
a virus .
your idea .
that's right .
do you really think you can fly that thing?
do you really think you can do all that bullshit you just said?
i understand you are upset over your wife's death .
but that's no excuse for making another fatal mistake .
no , my mistake was to appoint a snivelling weasel like you as secretary of defense .
you don't understand !
however , that is one mistake i am thankful to say that i don't have to live with .
mr president ...
mr nimsiki , you're fired .
let's organise every plane we can find and get us some goddamn pilots to fly 'em .
yes , sir .
he can't do that .
well , he just did .
command has attempted to list casualties and losses , but information is sketchy .
we know they've lost the belgian contingent in the sinai .
there's a strong possibility reinforcements are hiding in the golan straits .
what is he saying?
they're getting a signal .
old morse code .
it's from the americans .
they want to organise a counteroffensive !
it's about bloody time !
what do they plan to do?
we have confirmed reports of combat ready divisions
in europe , the middle east , and asia .
impressive .
considering it's all done with ...
morse code .
the armed forces here?
we have sufficient aircraft , but ...
but what?
pilots are comin 'up short .
well , then , find 'em .
ham radio operators from new york to japan trade rumours of military forces in hiding , unwilling to reveal themselves for fear of annihilation ...
we're planning to launch a counter offensive .
with our depleted manpower , we're asking that anyone with flight experience come forward .
military training is preferable , but anyone who can fly would be useful .
i can fly .
i'm a pilot .
all right , guys !
listen up !
pay attention .
these f 18s are very different than the jets you piloted .
it's strong .
forgive the expression , but this is a crash course in modern avionics .
keep it comin '.
ok , you got it !
all right , listen up .
first we need some background information on your experience .
let's start with you .
who , me?
well , i'm russell casse , sir .
and after 'nam i got into crop dusting .
and been doing that ever since .
on a personal note , sir , i'd just like to add that ever since i was kidnapped by aliens 10 years ago ,
i have been dyin 'for some payback .
i just want you to know that i won't let you down .
you have one tactical nuclear missile we're loading into this launcher under the right wing .
this is the firing mechanism .
it'll be attached to the ship's main console .
just like the amraam launch pad on a stealth .
except the nuke will not detonate at impact .
you'll have 30 seconds to get your asses out ofthere .
good luck , gentlemen .
30 seconds .
it's the strongest radio transmitter we had .
it'll tell us when you've uploaded the virus .
30 seconds .
don't you think that's cutting it too close?
we're gonna be well on our way back home before we shoot that thing off .
why you?
david !
i don't understand why you can't show someone else how to plant the virus .
no .
something may go wrong .
i may have to think quickly , adjust the signal .
who knows?
hey , you know how i'm always trying to save the planet?
here's my chance .
now he gets ambitious .
it's too tight .
well , i had to borrow it .
let me see .
ok .
all right , i guess that's good enough .
so .
how do i look?
oh , thank you .
you're a lot of help .
you're late !
well , you know me .
i know .
you like to make a big entrance .
listen .
before we do this , i just wanna say i'm sorry .
sorry for what , babe?
i should have done this a long time ago .
do you have the ring?
yes , sir .
here , make yourself useful .
witnesses?
we got hung up .
well , let's get this show on the road .
dearly beloved , we're gathered here in the sight of god and in the presence of these witnesses to join this man and this woman in holy matrimony .
any person who can show good cause why these two should not wed , please speak now or for ever hold your peace .
steve , will you take this woman to be your wedded wife , to live together with her in the holy state of matrimony?
will you love her , comfort her , honour and keep her in sickness and in health , and , forsaking all others , keep yourself only for her as long as you both shall live?
i will .
good morning .
they're a little young .
that they are .
they look a little nervous .
i need all flight crews to report to their designated areas .
major .
can i borrow that?
sir .
good morning .
good morning .
in less than an hour , aircraft from here will join others from around the world .
and you will be launching the largest aerial battle in the history of mankind .
mankind .
that word should have new meaning for all of us today .
we can't be consumed by our petty differences any more .
we will be united in our common interest .
perhaps it's fate that today is the fourth of july .
and you will once again be fighting for our freedom .
not from tyranny , oppression or persecution .
but from annihilation .
we're fighting for our right to live .
to exist .
and should we win the day , the fourth of july will no longer be known as an american holiday , but as the day when the world declared in one voice ,
we will not go quietly into the night !
we will not vanish without a fight !
we're going to live on !
we're going to survive !
today , we celebrate our independence day !
let's go !
