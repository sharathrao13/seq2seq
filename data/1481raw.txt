<i>what abortion? </ i>
<i>what abortion , mary? </ i>
i can explain .
explain what?
there is an explanation .
uh huh .
all that drama about artificial insemination .
kids 'names .
you got pictures of our friends 'babies all over the place .
why?
so you can flush it down the fuckin 'toilet?
we've been a fraud for a long time , mary .
oh , yeah?
why didn't you tell me that when you were sick , huh?
or did you expect one of your girlfriends to come and take care of you?
you came back because you wanted to .
don't blame me for that .
i came back to take care of you because i love you .
or because you were feeling lonely .
i'm sorry .
i'm sorry .
i can't keep going like this .
the insemination , the child .
it's like we're trying to put a band aid on something that's just been bled dry .
it's finished .
but it ... it isn't finished if we give it a chance and have this baby .
when we could have , you didn't want to .
we were separated , goddamn it !
it's different now !
yes , it's different .
we gonna go?
you only know how to think about yourself .

jack , jesus didn't come to free us from pain .
he came to give us the strength to bear it .
maybe he wanted this pain for me .
<i>no , he had nothing</ i> <i>to do with this . </ i>
<i>it was an accident . </ i>
no , it wasn't an accident .
jesus chose me for this .
jack , ask for the mercy ofjesus christ .
if it was an accident , why do i have to ask for his mercy?
i will have mercy on whom i will have mercy .
i will have compassion on whom i will have compassion .
don't be so prideful .
that's a sin .

forgive me?
i did everything he asked me to do !
i changed !
<i>i gave him my life, </ i> <i>and he betrayed me . </ i>
he put that fucking truck in my hand so i could carry out his will .
made me kill that man and those girls .
but hey , he didn't give me the strength to stay and save them .
