billy , what do you know about special agent harrison james?
he was supposed to deliver some information to us
which we were then to relay to washington , but he never showed .
special agent james has been with the clb over twelve years .
he has been extremely loyal and extremely effective .
all contact with him has been through telecommunications .
his identity has been classified due to the nature of his assignment .
and the nature is?
are you familiar with the name charles van adder .
yes .
supposedly the head of an internal spy ring .
a domestic organization , i believe .
we believe he is gathering classified government information
and selling it to the highest bidders .
special agent dexter ...
i am quite aware that you are responsible for shutting down
two ofthe biggest crime families in this city .
thank you for being so ... aware , sir .
even more impressive is you did so at such a young age .
however , much less inspiring are your achievements since your promotion .
you spend more time womanizing than giving a shit about national security .
some would call you a drunk .
we need you back one hundred per cent .
we need someone who knows the mob .
we're afraid van adder has united the families your team shut down ,
and now they're working against the government .
special agent james has compiled information on one of these .
identities ofvan adder informants , which would allow us to shut him down .
practically overnight .
why me?
why here in chicago?
special agent james was going to deliver the file to us here in chicago .
but he didn't .
why not?
we don't know .
do we think he's been killed?
we don't know .
the bureau does not like not knowing things .
dead or alive , james is in the area and van adder is on to him .
find special agent james and his file before van adder does .
you find him before the bureau does .
his woman has hired a detective .
he goes by the name flash .
see what he knows .
any problems ... deal with them .
goodbye , carlos .
i can't make it here without carlos .
i need you , kelly .
i miss you .
i miss you .
but i don't like what you do , boomer .
i don't like that city and i'm never going back there .
i'm leaving chicago , kell .
i want to come up there and be with you .
i want to make it work this time .
i want to make it work what are you saying?
i quit the department .
i'm done .
for good .
boomer , are you coming up here because you hate that city?
or because you love me?
i love you , kelly .
and i'll prove it to you ifyou give me one more chance .
just listen to me .
take care of everything you have to take care of down there .
and then get up here as fast as you can .

good looking guy .
mr yanosh rifkin .
aka the sexiest man in the chicago underworld .
this is james 'former partner .
we can monitor rifkin's line and pinpoint anyone who contacts him .
the problem is rifkin's a telecommunications expert .
we don't knowwhere the hell he is as he is a telecommunications expert .
the best there is .

i can't tell you what , or it won't be a surprise , dummy .
coffee might get me out of bed .
then i will go snag you some coffee .
then we'll hit the road .
why are you wearing my shirt?
i like this flower power action .
it takes the edge off my overbearing masculinity .
where's your shirt?
i don't know .
here it is .
why is there blood all over your shirt , boomer?
yeah , why is there blood on your shirt?
i told you , i bumped my head .
boomer , i don't like it when you lie to me .
especially when it involves bloody t shirts .
how did you get the cut on your head , boomer?
what happened to your car?
don't tell me you'll leave all that shit when you've only hauled it with you !
nobody's taking anything with them .
you're going to end up the dead one .

nobody will end up like carlos .
i'm sick ofthis shit !

two years ago .
and every day for two years i've carried this with me in my pocket .
every day during that awful job in that awful city .

surprise , surprise , motherfucker !

you can't stop me , motherfucker !
merry fucking christmas , asshole .

get out !
set it down now or we're both dead !
get out !

so long , harry jim .
you satisfied?
that guy had a chance to kill me and he didn't .
you killed his girl , didn't you?
why?
why not?
what goes around comes around .
i knowthat for a fact .
on many occasions i've been the cat to make the shit come around .
what's the word , coop?
it wasn't harrison james .
the report says that the dental work belongs to a 45 year old tobacco chewer .
deputy warner , did you actually ...
sheriff warner , did you see agent james?
first of all , who did we torch?
you brain surgeons can figure that out .
where is special agent james now?
if he's still in kurker county , we'll find him .
do me a favour , would you , reg?
this time try not to light him on fire .
i currently have two unidentified bodies at the food mart .
a dead sheriff and a young lady .
and your man is responsible .
we're talking about a federal agent .
i don't care if he's an astronaut .
come shit or shinola , ifwe find him , we just might torch the bastard again .
can we talk somewhere?
don't you ever give me one of your captain kangaroo speeches again .
don't get righteous because you have two dead bodies in your backyard .
some civilians got killed , yes .
that's the little picture .
the big picture is called national fucking security .
can you say that?
national fucking security .
that's right .
look , if special agent james is in this area , we must find him .
says here there was quite a shoot 'em up over in pine cove .
says a sheriffwas killed .
also says here a pretty young lady got shot up pretty badly .
six , seven times .
you know anything about that?
you had something to do with this?
i'm innocent .
well , it isn't my job to judge you .
but you've got to clear out of here tomorrow morning first thing .
deputy ray warner , please .
it was in your pants pocket .
i know .
now , you've got some bread , you've got some clean clothes .
would you like to take this along for guidance?
i'll feel better if you take this along .
for guidance .
go !
go !
bedroom's clear .
clear out here too .
shit .
okay , bring her here .
make double sure you've got no shadows .
nobody shadows tex .
all right , looks like me and you are going for a little ride , sweet tits .
who the fuck are you?
i said , who the fuck are you?
i'm harry james .
that's him , right there .
harry jim .
is it really you , harry?
i'm afraid so .
bullshit .
i don't know who you are , man , but you're not harry jim .
us blind fothermuckers have bullshit radar built in .
i need some information from you .
you do?
you give me one reason why i shouldn't blow your head off .
sockcucker .
tex , please tell me you frisked him .
i took a gun off him .
now you give me one good reason why i shouldn't blow your head off .
cocksucker .
whatever you're reaching for had better be a sandwich .
because you're going to eat it .
what do you know about harry jim , you little fat fuck?
he left messages .
i have the tapes .
then play them .
rifkin , pick up .
rifkin ...
i'm bad , man .
they got me bad .
i'm going to ...
canyon .
the old rendezvous .
i've got it on me .
what the fuck?
look way south ...
then go west , past joliette .
see it?
yeah , i see it .
why haven't you sent someone out there?
i don't give a shit anymore .
we've got company .
bring it on , sockcuckers .
clb , the building's surrounded .
we're not here to fight .
we're here to help .
fuck you .
killing a sheriff is a serious crime .
i could turn it into a parking ticket .
i need to know what you learned from rifkin .
i need to find special agent james , and i need your help .
i really don't feel like helping anybody right now .
i knowwhat happened up in pine cove .
i knowwhat happened to your friend in that hotel room .
i'm sorry , kid .
really , i am .
i've had two wives .
i lost them both because of this job .
one left me , the other one was taken away .
when this is all over , we can play spanish violins for each other ,
but until then , why don't you do something about it?
i'm betting van adder's following me right now .
i'll help you find harry ,
but ifyou and your boys tag along , he's never going to show his face .
but ifyou stay back in the shadows ,  he just might move in for the kill , letting us snag harry , the file  and van adder .
i'm sorry for what i said about harry .
calling him a bastard .
don't worry , he was .
he was a bastard .
any other man could go to hell , but he's the father of my son .
for that , he gets a second chance .
if he's still alive .
life's a bitch , isn't it?
look who's not dead yet .
i'd kill him right now .
before you kill anyone , you should know you're surrounded by federal agents .
yeah , right .
yes?
just what i wanted to hear .
i'm sorry .
laslov , did you find the file?
the case is right there .
miles?
where is the file?
we haven't touched a thing .
make sure it's not on him .
great .
maybe it wasn't in the case .
no , laslov !
he had it in his case when he met me at the rock quarry .
what did you do with it?
you were in here long enough to do something with it .
where is it?
it's nowhere on him .
start talking .
get this thing out of here .
what do you know , boomer?
what did you do with the file?
just start talking , please .
i didn't touch anything .
now you can keep screaming or start talking .
