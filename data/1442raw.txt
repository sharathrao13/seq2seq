there are many stories about michael sullivan .
some say he was a decent man .
some say there was no good in him at all .
but i once spent six weeks on the road with him ... ... in the winter of 1931 .
this is our story .
thank you , sir .
much obliged .

bless us , o lord , for thy gifts we are about to receive ... ... through the bounty of jesus christ , our lord .
amen .
michael?
sir?
it's a wake , so i don't want to see those dice .
no , sir .
hello .
i don't wanna go .
come on , it's all right .
no .
i'm scared .
ice helps preserve the body .
so ... ... who's got a hug for a lonely old man?
now then , which is which?
don't help me .
peter and michael .
no !
annie , mike , good to see you .
did you bring the necessary?
yes .
if you'll excuse me , i have urgent business with these young gentlemen .
yeah !
winner !
call the cops !
i know hustlers when i see them .
i don't hustle , old timer .
pay the man .
upstairs .
jacket pocket , in my study .
before i change my mind .
hello?
hello .
remind me , which little sullivan are you?
michael , sir .
sir?
you don't have to call me sir .
i'm not your pa .
no , mr. rooney .
call me connor .
no , call me uncle connor .
what do you want?
mr. rooney sent me to get his jacket .
you come back later , huh?
i'm busy .
yes ....
sir .
hello , hello .
i want to welcome all of you to my home .
it's good to have so many friends in this house again .
since mary died , it's ....
well , it's just been me and my boy rattling around in these rooms .
i had this speech prepared , but it would be ... ... dishonest of me to say that i knew danny well .
but lose one of us , it hurts us all .
i'll tell you what i do remember , though , and finn will remember this too ... ... and that's danny on the high school football team .
a championship game .
down six points , 10 seconds left to play ... ... four yards to go , danny tackles his own quarterback .
mistakes , you know ....
we all make them .
god knows .
let's drink to danny's honor .
let's swig him to god and hope that he gets to heaven ... ... at least an hour before the devil finds out he's dead .
amen .
to danny !
and now , i would like to ask a dear and a trusted friend ... ... finn mcgovern , to say a few words ... ... words that i'll wager got more poetry than mine .
get over here .
thank you , john .
my brother danny wasn't wise .
nor was he gentle .
and with a skinful of liquor in him , he was a pain in the ass .
but he was loyal and brave .
and he never told a lie .
he'd have enjoyed this party .
me and the family , we wanna say thank you to our generous host .
where would this town be without mr. john rooney?
i've worked for you for many years now , john .
nearly half my life .
and we've never had a disagreement .
i've come to realize that you rule this town ... ... as god rules the earth .
you give , and you take away  lovely .
lovely speech .
i'm gonna bury my brother .
then i'm gonna deal with you .
sure , finn , sure .
you'll take care of all of us .
once you get a good night's sleep .
he all right?
yeah , he's fine .
just too much to drink .
i'll talk to him .
take mike with you .
no , pa
take mike with you .
just talk , nothing more .
why are you always smiling?
'cause it's all so fucking hysterical .
michael .
what?
i had a nightmare .
it was about mr. rooney's house .
it's just a house .
a big house .
go back to sleep .
is mr. rooney rich like the babe?
richer .
are we rich?
no , stupid .
what's papa's job?
he works for mr. rooney .
why?
well , papa didn't have a father ... ... so mr. rooney looked after him .
i know that , but what's his job?
he goes on missions for mr. rooney .
they're very dangerous .
that's why he brings his gun .
sometimes even the president sends him on missions ... ... 'cause papa was a war hero and all .
you're just making that up .
i am not .
it's all so fucking hysterical .
peter , i can't come to your concert tonight .
i'm working .
working at what?
putting food on your plate , young man .
all right , boys , come on , clear the plates .
you're a good lad .
you want a shot?
no .
we're just talking to him , right?
sure .
don't get me wrong , finn .
i feel for you .
i do .
you can't let a thing like that give you cause to go mouthing off .
you and my dad , you go back many years ... ... and he is a just man .
so , what do you say?
come on now , finn .
make this easy .
we can't hear you .
all right .
good .
thank you .
i am sorry .
i'm sorry for your loss .
i'm sorry for this misunderstanding .
and i'm sorry your brother was such a fucking liar .
my brother was not a liar .
excuse me?
to protect my family and keep my job , i'll stay quiet .
but don't think i don't know something's going on .
don't think i won't find out what it is .
whoa , buddy
easy , easy .
easy .
we're just talking .
you tell your father my brother never stole from him .
i've checked the books .
he never sold booze to no one .
it's all accounted for .
lf he sold it , where's the money?
fuck should i know?
did you check his mattress?
maybe you should check yours .
there's something immoral here , don't you think , mike?
my beloved father throws your undeserving little brother ... ... the wake of his life , and this this is your thank you?
what a hideous world this is .
you think you're so smart .
you think we don't know?
you're spending so much time in chicago
what was that?
we're out of here .
jesus christ , connor , what the hell are you thinking? !
jesus .
michael .
are you hurt?
you saw everything?
jesus .
you are not to speak of this to anyone .
you understand?
not to anyone !
who's this?
it's one of yours?
he must have been hiding in the car .
well , can he keep a secret?
he's my son .
well , that's good enough for me .
you take him home .
think i'll walk .
perfect night for a stroll .
does mama know?
your mother knows i love mr. rooney .
when we had nothing ... ... he gave us a home , a life .
we owe him .
do you understand?
do you understand?
yes .
well , come on inside , then .
boys , clear your plates , please .
i'll do it later .
it's time for school now  it's only a plate !
what's he doing here?
michael was hiding in the car ... ... when i went out last night .
jesus , mike .
i've spoken to him .
it won't happen again .
mom .
mom !
just the feller ....
our secret , right?
i'm talking about the dice .
a man of honor always pays his debts .
and keeps his word .
i'm gonna be late for school .
how is michael?
is he okay?
i've spoken to him .
he understands .
that's tough ... ... seeing that for the first time .
well , you turned out .
you can't protect them forever .
if it wasn't this , it'd be something else .
natural law .
sons are put on this earth to trouble their fathers .
john's also made it clear that finn mcgovern's operation ... ... will be divided up locally ... ... among two territories that john will select personally .
i'd like to take this moment to thank mr. rance for ... ... interrupting a busy travel schedule to pay us a visit .
thank you , jack .
mr. rance met with john and me earlier to make another bid ... ... for our involvement in the unions .
what men do after work is what made us rich .
no need to screw them at work as well .
ls there any other business?
yes .
connor , is there something you would like to say about last night?
i'd like to apologize for what happened .
especially to you , pa .
two wakes in a month ....
what can i say?
we lost a good man last night .
you think it's funny?
try again .
i'd like to apologize
you would like to apologize?
try again .
gentlemen ... ... my apologies .
is everyone clear about bit borrowers?
there have been far too many debts outstanding .
mike ....
just give me their names .
tell me who to visit .
thank you , gentlemen .
come on upstairs .
mike .
dad forgot to give you this .
it's just a reminder for tony calvino .
he's light again .
are you coming?
no , i'm under house arrest for a while .
look , i'm sorry about last night .
i am .
i was ....
yeah .
all right .
help you , sir?
or just looking?
here to see tony calvino .
yeah , and who are you?
mike sullivan .
yes , sir .
you gonna frisk me?
should i?
it's a good idea .
that's the only one .
i mean , i'm a grown man and this place is getting to me .
every night there's trouble .
no one's got no dough , but all the world's here wasting it .
always money for frills and twists , and never money for food .
sometimes i despair the species , you know?
number 12 in the beauty parlor .
who's the lucky face?
i'm not from here originally , but jobs ain't hanging off trees , you know .
i'm a boxer by trade .
nine consecutive titles .
that's a record in south orange .
i'd make a pretty good bodyguard , i think .
what i'm saying is , is mr. rooney looking for anyone?
you know , anyone like me , for example?
is there any chance you might ask him?
sure .
thank you , mr. sullivan .
thank you very much .
i appreciate it .
mr. calvino?
mr. calvino , mike sullivan's here .
shit .
he wants to see you .
shit .
is he packing?
not anymore .
all right .
show him in .
hey , hey , hey .
you stick around , okay?
hey !
how the hell are you?
things good with the old man?
yeah .
what brings you here?
don't imagine it's the pussy .
i have a letter for you from mr. rooney .
am i behind again?
am i in trouble?
i don't know .
michael .
no !
no !
my god !
pa , i'm sorry .
stupid !
the kid would've talked .
i'm sorry .
goddamn you .
goddamn you !
i curse the fucking day you were born !
i curse it !
you !
oh , lord .
oh , lord .
god help us .
god help us .
this house is not our home anymore .
it's just an empty building .
all right , you stay here .
you stay out of sight .
don't go , pa .
don't go .
michael ... ... when they find out we're gone , they're gonna come after us .
i have to protect you now .
please , pa .
all right , here , take this .
no .
i don't want it .
take it .
i don't want it .
boy , take it !
you got six shots .
if i'm not back in half an hour , go tell reverend lynch what's happened .
do not go to father callaway .
i don't have any business with you , mr. kelly .
but i have business with you , mike .
go ahead .
what is that?
25, 000 dollars .
mr. rooney wants you to know there's more if you need it .
you have friends in ireland , mike .
why don't you take peter and leave?
i can't take peter .
he's dead .
so where's connor?
he's in hiding .
where?
you know i can't tell you that .
you think sticking a gun to my head is gonna make any difference to me?
if i tell you , i'm a dead man anyway .
we both are .
think , mike .
don't be stupid .
i'm just the messenger .
then give mr. rooney a message for me .
what is it?
give me the gun .
where are we going?
to chicago .
there's a man there who runs things .
i've done some work for him .
we have to find out where he stands .
try to get some sleep .
i want you to wait for me here .
sure .
i won't be long .
you'll be all right?
yeah , i'll be all right .
that's a good boy .
hello , mike .
hello , fellas .
it's nice to see you .
we heard what happened .
how you holding up?
i need to talk to mr. nitti .
he's awful busy .
i can wait .
okay .
take the man to the top .
certainly , sir .
sorry to make you wait so long , mike .
come on in .
we all just heard what happened .
jesus , i'm sorry , mike .
well , thank you for seeing me , mr. nitti .
come on , sit down .
like some coffee or ...?
no .
you sure?
yes , thank you .
so , what can i do for you , mike?
i'd like to work for you .
well , that's very interesting .
and in return , i'd like you to turn a blind eye to what i have to do .
and what is that?
kill the man who murdered my family .
is one more body gonna make a difference?
this is a good proposal , mr. nitti .
i will work only for you , and you know i can do a good job .
i respect you , mike .
i do .
we would like nothing more than to have you come work for us .
but not like this .
what you're asking me is impossible .
is it?
let me explain something to you that maybe you haven't realized .
all these years , you've been living under the protection ... ... of people who care about you .
and those same people are protecting you now , including me .
so if you go ahead with this , if you open that door ... ... you're walking through it alone .
and all that loyalty , all that trust , will no longer exist for you .
and mike , you won't make it .
not on your own .
and not with a little boy .
you're protecting him already?
we're protecting our interests , mike .
i drove all through the night to see you .
i appreciate that .
now i suggest you drive yourself back .
go home , mike .
go home and bury your wife and child .
with our blessing .
it won't be that simple .
you heard?
dad , listen to me .
he's in the building .
you can end this now .
take him now .
connor , get upstairs .
god help me .
god help me .
what do i do?
you think objectively .
and you make your choice .
what would you do if sullivan were just some guy?
god help me .
make it quick .
and the kid?
oh , christ .
no , no .
one day the kid becomes a man ....
think he won't remember?
i said not the kid .
all right .
i know who to call .
there's a guy who's done some work for us in the past .
he's gifted .
excuse me , ma'am .
press .
press .
he was raping my wife .
he raped my wife .
come on , come on , you're treading on the evidence here .
two minutes .
you got it , mr. maguire .
harlen maguire .
good evening , mr. nitti .
sixteen hundred .
sixteen hundred dollars is my rate , mr. nitti .
and what i make on the photographs is mine .
no , never met him .
but i know his work .
he traveling alone?
how old?
what do i do with the kid?
will do .
thank you .
you remember your aunt sarah?
your mom's sister?
she lives in perdition .
she'll take you in .
where is it?
right by the lake .
we went there once , all of us , when you were 4 , maybe 5 .
it's beautiful .
you remember?
the place with the dog .
hello?
sarah .
mike .
oh , thank god .
i want you to know we're okay .
where are you?
we're on our way to your place , if that's all right .
of course .
i'll be back there in two days .
how's michael?
he's all right .
how was it?
oh , mike ....
hello?
we'll see you soon .
hello , operator?
yes , sir .
i was just cut off , could you reconnect me?
you hungry?
no .
might not be another diner for a while , so you should eat .
i'm not hungry .
i just wanna read .
slow night , huh?
you kidding?
this is busy .
what can i get you?
you got a special?
everything's special .
ls that so?
everything except the food .
everything except the food?
you ought to be on the stage .
don't i know it .
give me some of that honey dipped fried chicken and a black coffee .
duck soup .
don't mind me , sir .
it's a free country .
used to be , anyhow .
no , thank you , sir .
is that your profession or your pleasure?
both , i guess .
to be paid to do what you love ....
ain't that the dream?
i guess so .
yourself?
i'm a salesman .
machine parts .
machine parts .
that's wonderful .
i assure you , it is not .
so who do you work for?
can you keep a secret?
i'm press .

all over .
i'm something of a rarity .
how's that?
i shoot the dead .
dead bodies , that is .
i don't kill them .
i should hope not .
always fascinated me , the look of them , you know?
you ever seen one?
yeah .
sorry for you .
terrible thing .
but it sure makes you feel alive , don't it?
i'll drink to that .
stuff makes you sweat , huh?
yeah , piss too .

i can take care of myself fine !
you never wanted me along anyway .
you think it's my fault this happened .

it was not your fault !
none of this is your fault .
just take me to aunt sarah's .
i can't take you there .
just take me to aunt sarah's .
i can't take you there .
not now .
why?
he knows that's where we're going .
so , what are you gonna do?
something i can't do alone .
you have to listen to me now , okay?
or else both of us are dead .
i have to make capone give up connor .
there's one thing chicago loves more than anything ... ... and that's their money .
they've got it in banks all over the state .
we have to find it and take it .
are you gonna help me?
yes .
then i have to teach you something .
you know what the clutch is?
sure i know what the clutch is .
what is the clutch?
the clutch , it ....
it clutches .
right , it clutches .
which of those pedals is the clutch?
that's the gas .
gas .
i'll show you .

there's the clutch , and it does the clutching .
let's go again .
release gas , clutch , shift gear , hit gas ....

look out for the tractor , mike .
michael , look out for the tractor .

watch out for the tractor !
we made it .
oh , yeah , yeah , we made it .
no more excuses .
i've told you once , now i'm telling you again
i'm looking for a mr. mcdougal .
just one moment .
well , this is a pleasant surprise .
i wasn't expecting another deposit until the end of the month .
actually , i'm making a withdrawal .
i want dirty money only .
everything you're holding for capone that's off the books .
open the safe .
you're insane .
you know they'll find out who you are .
the name's sullivan .
you want me to spell it?
open the box .
they'll kill you .
they're animals .
you don't say .
put it in .
that's for you .
call it a handling charge .
tell chicago i took it .
but if i read about this in the papers , if i read about the savings of farmers ... ... being wiped out by a heartless bank robber , i won't be happy .
good afternoon .
you really trust me not to say anything?
always trust a bank manager .
there's no rush .
coffee?
thank you .
so , what brings you guys to the middle of nowhere?
we're bank robbers .
we're just passing through .
so when do i get my share of the money?
well , how much do you want?
two hundred dollars .
okay .
deal .
could i have had more?
you'll never know .
come on , come on .
how much did they take?
how much?
what are we paying you for?
where's my father?
what's this?
why is no one talking to me?
i feel like a fucking prisoner .
i told you .
you are not a prisoner .
you are being protected .
this is what your father wants .
i can look after myself .
no , you can't .
this is the point .
you're a big baby who doesn't know his thumb from his dick .
fuck you .
the only reason you're still alive is because you're john rooney's son .
you're being a little shortsighted here , frank .
my father is an old man .
i am the future .
so don't you ever talk to me that way again .
maguire , do what you have to .
find them .
i'm sorry , mr. sullivan , there is no money .
no i can get you money , i just
it won't be chicago's .
they took it all out two days ago .
who authorized it?
the accountant .
what's his name?
this is mr. rance in the bridal suite .
before you proffer your congratulations , there's no mrs. rance with me ... ... and i'm all the better for it .
listen carefully ... ... because i am in no mood .
i'm going to say this only once .
i would like a boiled egg , and i want it runny .
pa , can we sleep in a motel room tonight instead of the car?
yeah , that would be nice .
how many more days you gonna want me , mister?
can't we close the curtains , even for a little while?
i can't get no sleep with all that light .
you see anything , you hit that horn twice .
don't get out of the car , no matter what .
bye .
ready?
i'm ready .
yes , sir .
right away , sir .
runny .
it's open .
top marks for speed , no marks for cookery .
what , may i ask , do you call this?
put it down .
mr. sullivan .
mr. rance .
how did you find me?
this is the best hotel in the area .
and you are so very particular .
yes , indeed , mr. sullivan .
may i ask you to lower your weapon .
thank you .
now , what do you want?
information .
i can't give you the files .
all right , all right .
they're in the next room .
ln here .
bring it in .
i can't see .
what will you accomplish by interfering with our business?
this has nothing to do with business .
it's all business .
you fail to grasp that .
and in business , you must have something to trade .
and you , mr. sullivan , have nothing to trade .
especially not for anyone as valuable as connor rooney .
i don't understand .
opening bell on wall street .
come on , open it .
which one is it?
no , no , not it .
tried that one already .
better start over .
you got one more try .
there it is .
i'm okay .
watch the road !
pa !
pa , are you okay?
pa !
pa !
help !
help us !
help !
help !
help us !
when are you two heading out?
we've stayed long enough .
we don't wanna cause you any trouble .
no trouble so far .
he's a good worker .
you have any kids?
no .
we met too late .
he dotes on you .
you don't see it .
hello .
i had a bad dream .
you wanna talk about it?
well , come on in .
take a seat ... ... if you want .
math , huh?
yeah .
i always hated it .
me too .
so , what do you like?
huh?
what subjects do you like?
did you like in school?
bible history , maybe .
why?
i like the stories .
peter was good at math .
was he?
did you like peter more than me?
no .
no , michael .
i loved you both the same .
but you were ....
you were different with me .
was i?
well ....
maybe it was because peter was just such a sweet boy , you know?
and you ....
you were more like me .
and i didn't want you to be .
i didn't mean to be ... ... different .
okay .
good night , pa .
good night .
michael , wake up .
get your things .
we're leaving .
we left you something .
hello , john .
you're a smart man , michael .
i wanna talk .
here?
downstairs .
i didn't think i'd see you again .
read this .
connor's been stealing from you for years .
he keeps accounts open under the names of dead men .
men like the mcgoverns .
i stood there and helped him kill finn to line his own pockets .
i thought i was working for you , but i wasn't .
you think i'd give up my son?
he was betraying you .
i know .
now , listen to me .
i tried to avoid more bloodshed .
you wouldn't accept that ... ... so i did what was necessary .
but i've always loved you like a son .
and now i'm telling you , leave before it's too late .
think .
think .
they're protecting him now , but when you're gone , they won't need him .
this ends with connor dead regardless .
that may be ... ... but you are asking me ... ... to give you the key to his room so you can walk in ... ... put a gun to his head and pull the trigger .
i can't do that .
he murdered annie and peter .
there are only murderers in this room .
michael , open your eyes .
this is the life we chose , the life we lead .
none of us will see heaven .
michael could .
then do everything that you can to see that that happens .
leave .
i'm begging you .
it's the only way .
and if i go?
then ... ... i will mourn ... ... the son i lost .
what are you gonna do?
just one last thing , and then it's done .
go back to bed , michael .
i'm glad it's you .
i understand .
but then al wants your assurance that after that , it's over .
the lexington hotel , room 1432 .
is that the house?
that's it .
i knew there was a dog .
sarah?
it's me , mike .
we're here .
smile .
give me the gun .
michael .
michael ... ... don't you do this .
give me the gun , michael .
come on .
give me the gun .
i couldn't do it .
i know .
pa .
i'm sorry .
i'm sorry .
i'm sorry .
i'm sorry .
pa .
pa !
pa !
pa !
pa !
pa !
i saw then that my father's only fear ... ... was that his son would follow the same road .
and that was the last time i ever held a gun .
people always thought i grew up on a farm .
and i guess , in a way , i did .
but i lived a lifetime before that ... ... in those six weeks on the road ... ... in the winter of 1931 .
when people ask me if michael sullivan was a good man ... ... or if there was just no good in him at all ... ... i always give the same answer .
he was my father .
