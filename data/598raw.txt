locutus .
i am locutus of borg .
resistance is futile .
authorization picard four seven alpha tango .
admiral .
catched you in a bad time , jean luc?
no , of course not .
i've just received a disturbing report from deep space five .
our colony on ivor prime was destroyed this morning .
long range sensors have picked up
i know .
the borg .
captain's log , stardate 50893 . 5 .
the moment i've dreaded for nearly six years has arrived .
the borg , our most lethal enemy ... have begun an invasion of the federation ... and this time , there may be no stopping them .
how many ships?
one , on a direct course for earth .
they'll cross the federation border in less than an hour .
admiral hayes is mobilizing a fleet in the typhon sector .
at maximum warp , it will take us 3 hours , 25 minutes
we're not going .
what do you mean we're not going?
our orders are to patrol the neutral zone ... in case the romulans decide to take advantage of the situation .
the romulans?
captain , there's been no unusual activity ... along the romulan border for the last nine months .
it seems highly unlikely they'd choose this moment to start a conflict .
does starfleet feel we need more shakedown time?
we've been in space nearly a year .
we're ready .
the enterprise e is the most advanced starship in the fleet .
we should be on the front line .
i've gone over this with starfleet command .
their orders stand .
number one , set a course for the neutral zone .
bizet?
berlioz .
what do you have?
we finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone .
oh , fascinating .
twenty particles of space dust per cubic meter ... fifty two ultraviolet radiation spikes ... and a class il comet .
this is worthy of our attention .
why are we chasing comets?
let's just say starfleet has every confidence ... in the enterprise and her crew .
they're not sure about her captain .
they believe a man who was captured ... and assimilated by the borg ... shouldn't be put in a situation where he would face them again .
to do so would introduce an unstable element ... into a critical situation .
that's ridiculous .
your experience makes you perfect to lead this fight .
admiral hayes disagrees .
bridge to captain picard .
go ahead .
we've received word from the fleet .
they've engaged the borg .
put starfleet frequency one four eight six on audio .
aye , sir .
flagship to endeavor .
stand by to engage at grid a 15 .
acknowledged .
we have it in visual range a borg cube on course zero mark two one five .
speed warp nine point
we are the borg .
lower your shields and surrender .
we will add your biological and technological distinctiveness ... to our own .
your culture will adapt to service us .
resistance is futile .
they've broken through the defense perimeter .
the cube is changing course .
zero two one mark four .
starfleet command , we need reinforcements .
ninety six dead , 22 wounded on the lexington !
this is commander luxi on the madison ...
lieutenant hawk , set a course for earth .
aye , sir .
maximum warp .
i'm about to commit a direct violation of orders .
any of you who wish to object should do so now .
it will be noted in my log .
i believe i speak for everyone when i say ...
to hell with our orders .
red alert .
all hands to battle stations .
engage .
report !
our weapons are gone .
perhaps today is a good day to die .
prepare for ramming speed !
sir , there's another starship coming in .
it's the enterprise .
the defiant's losing life support .
transporter room , beam the defiant survivors aboard .
the admiral's ship has been destroyed .
what's the borg cube's status?
it has sustained heavy damage to its outer hull .
i am reading fluctuations in their power grid .
on screen .
number one , open a channel to the fleet .
channel open .
this is captain picard .
i'm taking command of the fleet .
target all your weapons onto the following coordinates .
fire at my command .
the coordinates you have indicated ... do not appear to be a vital system .
trust me , data .
the fleet's responded .
they're standing by .
fire .
mr. hawk , pursuit course .
engage .
aye , sir .
what?
i hear them .
i have a patient who insists on coming to the bridge .
welcome aboard , mr. worf .
thank you , sir .
the defiant .
adrift , but salvageable .
tough little ship .
little?
we could use help at tactical .
you do remember how to fire phasers?
sensors show chronometric particles ... emanating from the sphere .
they're creating a temporal vortex .
time travel .
data , report .
we're caught in a temporal wake .
captain ... earth .
the atmosphere contains ... high concentrations of methane , carbon monoxide , and fluorine .
life signs?
population approximately nine billion .
all borg .
how?
they must've done it in the past .
they went back and assimilated earth , changed history .
lf they changed history , why are we still here?
the temporal wake ... must have protected us from changes in the time line .
the vortex is collapsing .
hold your course , mr. hawk .
we must follow them back ... repair whatever damage they've done .
come on .
good night , eddy .
go home .
you're gonna regret this tomorrow .
one thing you should have learned about me by now ... is i don't have regrets .
come on , lily .
one more round .
z , you've had enough .
i'm not going up in that thing with a drunken pilot .
i sure as hell am not going up there sober .
what is that?
that is the constellation leo .
no .
that .
it's an econ !
after all these years?
we gotta get to the phoenix .
to hell with the phoenix .
help !
move out !
this way !
run !
report .
shields are down .
long range sensors are off line .
main power's holding .
according to our astrometric readings ... we are in the mid 21st century .
from the radioactive isotopes in the atmosphere ...
i estimate we have arrived 10 years after world war ill .
makes sense .
most of the major cities have been destroyed .
very few governments left .
600 million dead .
no resistance .
captain ...
mr. worf , quantum torpedoes .
ready , sir .
fire .
they were firing at the surface .
location?
western hemisphere , north american continent .
looks like a missile complex in central montana .
missile complex ...
the date .
data , i need to know the exact date .
april 4 ... 2063?
april 4th the day before first contact .
precisely .
the missile complex must be where zefram cochran ... is building his warp ship .
that's what they came to do stop first contact .
how much damage , lieutenant?
can't tell .
long range sensors are still off line .
we have to go down , find out what happened .
data , beverly , you're with me .
have a security team meet us in transporter room three .
computer , mid 21st century civilian clothing .
number one , you have the bridge .
over here .
they're all dead .
see if one of them is cochran .
data , let's go check the warp ship .
the structural integrity of the missile appears intact ... but there is significant damage ... to various sections of the fuselage ... and primary intercooler system .
we have blueprints in the enterprise computer .
commander la forge will need to bring a team here
hold your fire !
we're here to help !
bullshit !
captain , i believe i can handle this .
greetings .
captain , this woman requires medical attention .
severe theta radiation poisoning .
the radiation's from the damaged throttle assembly .
we all have to be inoculated .
i have to get her to sick bay .
doctor ...
no lectures about the prime directive .
i'll keep her unconscious .
very well .
tell riker to beam down with a search party .
we need to find cochran .
crusher to enterprise two to beam directly to sick bay .
in less than 48 hours , this ship has to be launched .
picard to engineering .
la forge here .
geordi , cochran's ship was damaged .
come with an engineering detail .
we have work to do .
i'm on my way .
alpha team , let's assemble in transporter room three .
we're heading to the surface .
porter , you're in command till i get back .
and check out the environmental controls while i'm gone .
it's getting warm in here .
let's go .
isn't it amazing?
this ship used to be a nuclear missile .
it's an historical irony that cochran would choose ... an instrument of destruction to inaugurate an era of peace .
it's a boyhood fantasy .
i've seen this ship hundreds of times in the smithsonian ... but i was never able to touch it .
does tactile contact alter your perception of the phoenix?
yes .
for humans , touch can connect you to an object ... in a very personal way , make it seem more real .
i am detecting imperfections in the titanium casing ... temperature variations in the fuel manifold .
it is no more real to me now than it was a moment ago .
would you three like to be alone?
what have you found out?
there's no sign of cochran in the complex .
he has to be here .
there was nothing more important to him than this ship .
this flight was his dream .
we should consider the possibility ... that dr. cochran was killed in the attack .
lf that's true ... the future may die with him .
what do you think?
the environmental system's gone crazy .
it's not just engineering .
it's the entire deck .
maybe it's a problem with the e. p. s. conduits .
hello?
hey !
are you talking to me?
is anyone else working in this section?
not that i know of .
aah !
paul?
paul?
are you ok in there?
aah !
captain?
what is it?
picard to enterprise
mr. worf , is everything all right there?
yes , sir .
we're experiencing environmental difficulties on deck 16 ... but that is all .
what kind of difficulties?
humidity levels have risen 73 % ... and the temperature has jumped 10 degrees in the last hour .
mr. data and i are returning to the ship .
number one , take charge down here .
aye , sir .
damage to her cell membranes is repaired .
she should be fine ... but i'd like to run another test on her spinal tissue .
and find out why it's so hot in here .
now what?
crusher to engineering .
crusher to bridge .
worf , i need to know exactly what's been happening .
we just lost contact with deck 16 communications , internal sensors , everything .
i was about to send a security team to investigate .
no .
seal off deck 16 .
post security teams at every access point .
aye , sir .
before we lost internal sensors ... what were the exact conditions in main engineering?
atmospheric pressure was 2 kilopasquals above normal ninety two percent humidity , 39 . 1 degrees celsius .
39 . 1 degrees celsius ...
like a borg ship .
they knew their ship was doomed .
our shields were down .
somehow they transported here without being detected .
they'll assimilate the enterprise , and then ...
earth .
picard to riker .
enterprise to away team .
respond .
main control is being rerouted ... through main engineering weapons , shields , propulsion .
quickly , mr. data , lock out the main computer .
i have isolated the main computer ... with a fractal encryption code .
it is unlikely the borg will be able to break it .
the borg have cut primary power to all decks except 16 .
the borg won't stay on deck 16 .
wake up .
you're all right .
come on .
wake up .
hmm !
stay calm .
you are all right .
you are gonna be fine .
i need you to do as i say .
alyssa , is the e. m. h. program still on line?
it should be .
that's a girl .
i swore i'd never use one of these .
computer , activate the e. m. h. program .
e. m. h. please state the nature of the medical emergency .
twenty borg are about to break through .
we need time to get out .
create a diversion .
this isn't part of my program .
i'm a doctor , not a doorstop .
do a dance , tell a story .
i don't care .
just give us a few seconds .
ahem .
according to starfleet medical research ...
borg implants can cause severe skin irritations .
perhaps you'd like an analgesic cream?
which way?
we need to get off this deck .
follow me .
first thing they'll do in engineering ... is establish a collective a central point from which they can control the hive .
if we fire particle weapons in engineering ... there's a risk we may hit the warp core .
our goal should be to puncture one of the plasma coolant tanks .
data?
excellent idea .
plasma coolant liquefies organic material on contact .
but the borg are not entirely organic .
true , but like all cybernetic life forms ... they cannot survive without their organic components .
i have ordered all weapons to be set ... on a rotating modulation .
the borg will adapt quickly .
we will be able to fire 12 shots at most .
one other thing
you may encounter enterprise crew members ... who have already been assimilated .
don't hesitate to fire .
believe me , you'll be doing them a favor .
let's go .
deanna?
deanna !
deanna !
no , no !
don't turn off that
who is this jerk?
who told him he could turn off my music?
will riker ...
zefram cochran .
he a friend of yours?
yes .
husband?
no .
good .
now , this , dina ...
deanna .
this ... is the good stuff .
dr. cochran  shh !
to the phoenix ... may she rest in peace .
ohh .
ok ... that wasn't so good .
will , i think we have to tell him the truth .
but the time line  time line? !
this is no time to argue about time !
we don't have the time .
what was i saying?
you're drunk .
i am not .
yes , you are .
he wouldn't talk to me unless i had a drink with him .
then it took three shots of something called tequila ... just to find out he was the one we're looking for .
i've spent the last 20 minutes trying to keep his hands off me .
so don't go criticizing my counseling technique .
sorry .
it's a primitive culture .
i'm just trying to blend in .
you're blended , all right .
i told our cover story .
he didn't believe me .
we're running out of time .
if we tell the truth , do you think he can handle it?
lf you're looking for my professional opinion ... as ship's counselor ... he's nuts .
i'll be sure to note that in my log .
captain , i believe i am feeling ... anxiety .
it is an intriguing sensation .
a most distracting
i'm sure it's a fascinating experience ... but you should deactivate your emotion chip for now .
good idea , sir .
done .
data , there are times that i envy you .
it's only me !
are you all right?
yes , but we have wounded here .
lopez , get these people to deck 14 .
there was a civilian a woman from the 21st century .
we got separated .
we'll watch for her .
she has no idea what's going on .
try to find her .
lower your weapons .
they'll ignore us till they consider us a threat .
the manual release .
mr. worf , hold this position .
manual release is on line .
perhaps we should just knock .
data .
ready phasers !
data , cover me .
captain , they've adapted !
aah !
regroup on deck 15 .
don't let them touch you !
captain !
data !
uhh !
here !
help .
please , help .
aah !
you !
how did you  back off !
calm down !
shut up !
who are you?
jean luc picard
no !
who are you with? !
what faction?
i'm not a member of the eastern coalition .
shut up !
i don't care who you're with .
get me out of here .
now !
that isn't going to be easy .
find a way , soldier , or i'll push buttons .
all right !
follow me .
slow !
your efforts to break the encryption codes ... will not be successful ... nor will your attempts to assimilate me ... into your collective .
brave words .
i've heard them before ... from thousands of species across thousands of worlds ... since long before you were created .
but now , they are all borg .
i am unlike any life form you have encountered .
the codes in my neural net cannot be forcibly removed .
you are an imperfect being created by an imperfect being .
finding your weakness is only a matter of time .
let me make sure i understand you , commander .
a group of cybernetic creatures from the future ... have traveled back through time to enslave the human race ... and you're here to stop them?
that's right .
hot damn .
you're heroic .
we're gonna prove it to you .
geordi?
there she is .
beautiful !
all right , take a look .
well , well , well .
what we got here?
i love a good peep show .
that's a trick .
how'd you do that?
it's your telescope .
that's our ship , the enterprise .
and lily's up there now?
that's right .
can i talk to her?
we've lost contact .
we don't know why yet .
what is it you want me to do?
simple .
conduct your warp flight tomorrow morning as you planned .
why tomorrow morning?
because at 11 : 00 ... an alien ship will begin passing through this solar system .
alien .
you mean extraterrestrials?
more bad guys?
good guys .
they're on a survey mission .
they have no interest in earth .
too primitive .
oh .
when they detect your ship's warp signature ... and realize humans can now travel faster than light ... they decide to alter their course ... and make first contact with earth right here .
here?
actually , over there .
it is a pivotal moment in human history .
you make first contact with an alien race ... and after you do , everything begins to change .
your theories on warp drive ... allow fleets of starships to be built ... and mankind to start exploring the galaxy .
it unites humanity in a way no one thought possible ... when they realize they're not alone in the universe .
poverty , disease , war they'll all be gone in 50 years .
but unless you make that warp flight tomorrow morning ... before 11 : 15 , none of it will happen .
and you people , you're all astronauts ... on some kind of star trek .
i know this is a lot for you to take in ... but we're running out of time .
we need your help .
what do you say?
why not?
it's pretty bad , sir .
it looks like they control decks 26 up to 11 .
but when they took deck 11 , they just stopped .
the borg have assimilated more than half the ship ... in a matter of hours .
why stop there?
what is on deck 11?
hydroponics , stellar cartography ... deflector control .
no vital system .
they wouldn't stop unless it gave a tactical advantage .
return to your checkpoint .
send reports every 10 minutes .
something must've happened in sick bay .
where are dr. crusher and the others?
why did you break the cease fire?
we didn't attack you .
who did?
there's a new faction ... that wants to prevent your launch tomorrow morning ... but we're here to help you .
this may be difficult for you to accept ... but you are not in montana anymore .
you're on a ship a spaceship orbiting the earth at an altitude
you wanna help me , get me outta here .
all right .
you want a way out , here it is .
what is this?
australia ...
new guinea , the solomons .
montana will be up soon .
but you may want to hold your breath .
it's a long way down .
now , listen to me , i'm not your enemy ... and i can get you home .
but first you must put that weapon down and trust me .
jean luc picard .
my name .
that's my name .
what's yours?
lily .
welcome aboard , lily .
thank you .
maximum setting .
if you'd fired this , you would've vaporized me .
it's my first ray gun .
there's no glass .
aah !
force field .
i've never seen that kind of technology .
that's because it hasn't been invented yet .
what?
there's more i have to tell you .
come on .
are you ready?
who are you?
i am the borg .
that is a contradiction .
the borg have a collective consciousness .
there are no individuals .
i am the beginning ... the end ... the one who is many .
i am the borg .
greetings .
i am curious .
do you control the borg collective?
you imply a disparity where none exists .
i am the collective .
perhaps i should rephrase the question .
i wish to understand ... the organizational relationships .
are you their leader?
i bring order to chaos .
an interesting , if cryptic response .
you are in chaos , data .
you are the contradiction .
a machine who wishes to be human .
since you seem to know so much about me ... you must be aware that i am programmed to evolve ... to better myself .
we , too , are on a quest to better ourselves .
evolving toward a state of perfection .
forgive me , but the borg do not evolve , they conquer .
by assimilating other beings into our collective ... we are bringing them closer to perfection .
somehow i question your motives .
that is because you haven't been properly ... stimulated yet .
you have reactivated my emotion chip .
why?
don't be frightened .
i am not frightened .
do you know what this is , data?
it would appear you are attempting ... to graft organic skin onto my endo skeletal structure .
what a cold description for such a beautiful gift .
was that good for you?
ooh .
how many planets are in this federation?
over 150 spread across 8, 000 light years .
you must not get home much .
actually , i tend to think of this ship as home .
but if it's earth you're talking about ...
i try to get back whenever i can .
good .
they haven't broken the encryption code yet .
who , those bionic zombies you told me about?
the
borg .
borg?
sounds swedish .
how big is this ship?
there are 24 decks .
almost 700 meters long .
it took me six months to scrounge enough titanium ... to build a four meter cockpit .
how much did this thing cost?
the economics of the future are different .
you see , money doesn't exist in the 24th century .
no money?
you mean you don't get paid?
the acquisition of wealth is no longer ... the driving force in our lives .
we work to better ourselves ... and the rest of humanity .
actually , we're rather like yourself and dr. cochran .
aah !
all right !
all right .
come on .
is there another way around?
i know what i'm doing .
definitely not swedish .
aah !
aah !
what the hell are you doing?
perhaps something in satin?
and you do understand we have a strict dress code ... so if you boys don't leave right now , i'll
i'm looking for nicky the nose .
the nose?
he hasn't been here in months .
this is the wrong chapter .
computer , begin chapter 13 .
lf i say i love you ...
try to look as if you're having a good time .
i want you to know ... it's not just because there's moonlight ... although ...
no .
look at me .
try to act naturally .
there he is .
you're all dressed up ... to go dreamin '.
now , don't tell me , i know ...
mmm .
ruby .
this is not a good time .
it's never the time for us , is it , dix?
always some excuse , some case you're working on .
i have talk to nicky .
i'll see you later .
watch your caboose and dump the broad .
lf i say ...
i love you ...
i want you to know ...
well , well , well , look what the cat dragged in .
what's shakin ', dix?
the usual , martinis and skirts .
excuse me .
whaa !
no offense .
ooh !
aah !
yaaaah !
aah !
hey !
i think you got him .
i don't get it .
i thought you said this was all a bunch of holograms .
i disengaged the safety protocols .
without them , even a holographic bullet can kill .
what are you doing?
i'm looking for the neuro processor .
every borg has one .
it's like a memory chip .
it will contain a record of all the instructions ... this borg has been receiving from the collective .
oh , my .
jean luc , it's one of your uniforms .
yes .
this was ensign lynch .
tough luck , huh?
i've got to get to the bridge .
go on .
jeez .
ffft .
doctor?
yeah?
would you mind taking a look at this?
uh , ahem , yeah .
ahem .
i tried to reconstruct the intermix chamber ... from what i remember in school .
tell me if i got it right .
you learned about this in school?
basic warp design is required at the academy .
the first chapter is called " zefram cochran .
well , looks like you got it right .
commander , this is what we're thinking of using ... to replace the damaged warp plasma conduit .
yeah , reg , that's good , but you need ... to reinforce this copper tubing with a nano polymer .
dr. cochran , i know this sounds silly ... but can i shake your hand?
oh , thank you , doctor .
i can't tell you what an honor it is to work with you .
i never imagined i'd meet the inventor of warp drive
reg !
i'm sorry .
right .
thanks .
do they have to keep doing that?
it's just a little hero worship .
to tell you the truth , i can't say i blame them .
we all grew up hearing about what you did here ... or what you're about to do .
i probably shouldn't even tell you this ... but i went to zefram cochran high school .
really?
you know , i wish i had a picture of this .
what?
well , you see , in the future ... this whole area becomes an historical monument .
you're standing almost on the exact spot ... where your statue's gonna be .
statue?
oh , yeah .
it's marble , about 20 meters tall ... and you're looking up at the sky ... and your hand's sort of reaching toward the future .
i gotta take a leak .
leak?
i'm not detecting any leak .
don't you people from the 24th century ever pee?
oh .
leak .
i get it .
that's pretty funny .
excuse me .
commander?
captain .
jean luc .
reports of my assimilation are greatly exaggerated .
i found something you lost .
i am a klingon .
mr. worf , report .
the borg control over half the ship .
we have tried to restore power ... to the bridge and weapons systems ... but we have been unsuccessful .
we have another problem .
i've accessed a borg neuro processor ... and i've discovered what they're trying to do .
they're transforming the deflector dish ... into an interplexing beacon .
interplexing?
it's a sub space transmitter .
if they activate the beacon , they'll establish a link ... with the borg living in this century .
but in the 21st century ... the borg are still in the delta quadrant .
reinforcements .
humanity will be an easy target .
attack the earth in the past to assimilate the future .
then we must destroy the deflector dish ... before they can activate the beacon .
we can't get to deflector control or a shuttlecraft
mr. worf , do you remember your zero g combat training?
i remember it made me sick to my stomach .
what are you suggesting?
i think it's time that we took a little stroll .
hang on .
there's a humanoid life sign up ahead .
511 meters .
cochran?
mm hmm .
it's him all right .
i have remodulated the pulse emitters ... but i do not believe we will get more ... than one or two shots before the borg adapt .
then we must make every shot count .
magnetize .
watch your caboose , dix .
i intend to .
how are you doing , mr. worf?
not well , sir .
try not to look at the stars .
keep your eyes on the hull .
let's go .
tell me , are you using a polymer based neuro relay ... to transit the organic nerve impulses ... to the central processor of my positronic net?
if that is the case , how have you solved ... the problem of increased signal degradation ... inherent to organo synthetic transmission
do you always talk this much?
not always ... but often .
why do you utilize this primitive communication?
your android brain is capable of so much more .
have you forgotten?
i am endeavoring to become more human .
human .
we used to be exactly like them flawed , weak , organic .
but we evolved to include the synthetic .
now we use both to attain perfection .
your goal should be the same as ours .
believing oneself to be perfect ... is often the sign of a delusional mind .
small words from a small being ... trying to attack what he doesn't understand .
i understand that you have no real interest in me ... that your goal is to obtain the encryption codes ... for the enterprise computer .
that is one of our goals ... one of many ... but in order to reach it ...
i'm willing to help you reach yours .
aah !
is it becoming clear to you yet?
look at yourself standing there ... cradling the new flesh that i've given you .
if it means nothing to you , why protect it?
i ... am simply imitating the behavior of humans .
you're becoming more human all the time , data .
now you're learning how to lie .
my programming was not designed to process these sensations .
then tear the skin from your limb ... as you would a defective circuit .
go ahead , data .
we won't stop you .
do it .
don't be tempted by flesh .
are you familiar with physical forms of pleasure?
if you are ... referring to ... sexuality ...
i am fully functional ... programmed in multiple techniques .
how long has it been since you've used them?
eight years ... seven months , sixteen days , four minutes
far too long .
we should bring reinforcements .
there's no time .
it looks as if they're building the beacon ... right on top of the particle emitter .
once all the transponder rods are in place ... the beacon will be activated .
lf we set our phasers to full power
no .
there's a risk that we hit the dish .
it's charged with anti protons .
we could destroy half the ship .
we have to find another way .
doctor?
sir?
you still looking for the bathroom?
i'm not going back .
look , doc , we can't do this without you .
i don't care .
i don't want to be a statue .
doctor  you stay away from me .
we don't have time for this .
unh !
you told him about the statue?
for this to work ... all three maglocks will have to be released .
magnetic constrictors are disengaged .
they've adapted .
warning .
decompression in 45 seconds .
hawk !
aah !
we've had a change of plans , data .
assimilate this .
only got an hour to go , doc .
how you feeling?
i got a four alarm hangover ... either from the whiskey or your laser beam ... or both ... but i'm ready to make history .
ha ha ha !
troi to commander riker .
riker here .
we're ready to open the launch door .
go ahead .
oh .
look at that .
you don't have a moon in the 24th century?
sure we do .
just looks a lot different .
there are 50 million people living on the moon in my time .
you can see tycho city , new berlin ... even lake armstrong on a day like this .
uh huh .
and you know , doctor
please !
don't tell me it's all thanks to me .
i've heard enough about the great zefram cochran .
i don't know who writes your history books ... or where you get your information from ... but you people got some pretty funny ideas about me .
you all look at me as if i'm some kind of ... saint or visionary or something .
i don't think you're a saint , doc ... but you did have a vision , and now we're sitting in it .
you want to know what my vision is?
dollar signs .
money .
i didn't build this ship to usher in a new era for humanity .
you think i want to go to the stars?
i don't even like to fly .
i take trains .
i built this so i could retire to some tropical island ... filled with ... naked women .
that's zefram cochran .
that's his vision .
this other guy you keep talking about ... this historical figure?
i never met him .
i can't imagine i ever will .
someone once said , " don't try to be a great man .
just be a man and let history make its own judgments .
that's rhetorical nonsense .
who said that?
you did .
10 years from now .
you got 58 minutes , doc .
you better get on that checklist .
they're on the move again .
the borg just overran three of our defense checkpoints .
they've taken over decks five and six .
they've adapted to every modulation of our weapons .
we have to work on finding another way ... to modify our weapons so they'll be more effective .
in the meantime , tell your men to stand their ground .
sir
fight hand to hand if they have to .
aye , sir .
wait .
captain , our weapons are useless .
we must activate the auto destruct sequence ... and use the escape pods to evacuate the ship .
no !
lf we destroy the ship , we destroy the borg .
we're going to stay and fight .
sir , we have lost the enterprise .
we should not sacrifice
we have not lost the enterprise .
we are not going to lose her , not while i'm in command .
you have your orders .
i must object to this course of action
objection noted .
with all due respect , sir , i believe you are allowing ... your personal experience to influence your judgment .
you're afraid .
you want to destroy the ship and run away .
you coward .
jean luc !
if you were any other man , i would kill you where you stand .
get off my bridge .
what do we do now?
we carry out his orders .
dyson , kaplan , start working on a way to modify the weapons
this is stupid .
if we can get off this ship and then blow it up , do it .
once the captain's made up his mind , the discussion's over .
lily !
you son of a bitch .
this really isn't the time .
ok .
i don't know jack about the 24th century ... but everybody out there thinks that staying here ... and fighting the borg is suicide .
they're just afraid to come in here and say it .
the crew is accustomed to following my orders .
they're probably accustomed to your orders making sense .
none of them understand the borg as i do !
no one does .
no one can .
what is that supposed to mean?
six years ago ... they assimilated me into their collective .
they had cybernetic devices implanted throughout my body .
i was linked to the hive mind ... every trace of individuality erased .
i was one of them .
so you can imagine , my dear ...
i have a somewhat unique perspective on the borg ... and i know how to fight them .
now , if you will excuse me , i have work to do .
i am such an idiot .
it's so simple .
the borg hurt you ... and now you're going to hurt them back .
in my century , we don't succumb to revenge .
we have a more evolved sensibility .
bullshit !
i saw the look on your face ... when you shot those borg on the holodeck .
you were almost enjoying it .
how dare you?
come on , captain .
you're not the first man ... to get a thrill from murdering someone .
i see it all the time .
get out !
or what?
you'll kill me like you killed ensign lynch?
there was no way to save him .
you didn't even try !
where was your evolved sensibility then?
i don't have time for this .
oh , hey , i'm sorry .
i didn't mean to interrupt your little quest .
captain ahab has to go hunt his whale .
what?
you do have books in the 24th century?
this is not about revenge .
liar !
this is about saving the future of humanity !
jean luc , blow up the damn ship !
no !
no !
i will not sacrifice the enterprise .
we've made too many compromises , too many retreats .
they invade our space , and we fall back .
they assimilate entire worlds , and we fall back .
not again .
the line must be drawn here !
this far , no farther !
and i will make them pay for what they've done !
you broke your little ships .
see you around , ahab .
and he piled upon the whale's white hump ...
the sum of all the rage and hate ...
felt by his whole race .
if his chest had been a cannon ...
he would have shot his heart upon it .
what?
moby dick .
actually , i never read it .
ahab spent years ... hunting the white whale that crippled him .
quest for vengeance .
but in the end ... it destroyed him and his ship .
i guess he didn't know when to quit .
prepare to evacuate the enterprise .
a. t. r. setting?

enable .
self destruct in 15 minutes .
there will be no further audio warnings .
so much for the enterprise e.
we barely knew her .
you think they'll build another one?
plenty of letters left in the alphabet .
mr. worf .
i regret some of the things i said to you earlier .
some?
as a matter of fact ...
i think you're the bravest man i have ever known .
thank you , sir .
see you on gravett island .
captain .
data .
control to phoenix .
final launch sequence checks are complete .
good luck .
everybody ready to make some history?
always am .
i think i forgot something .
what?
i don't know .
it's probably nothing .
begin ignition sequence .
oh , god !
now i remember .
what?
where is it?
we can't lift off without it .
geordi , we've got to abort .
no !
no , wait !
i found it .
twelve , eleven ... ten ... nine ... eight ...
let's rock 'n 'roll !
you don't know what ... we can find .
why don't you come with me , little girl ... on a magic carpet ride?
you don't know what ... we can see .
why don't you tell your dreams to me?
could you turn that down a little?
close your eyes
we've got a red light on the second intake valve .
ignore it .
we'll be fine .
prepare first stage shutdown and separation on my mark .
three ... two ... one ... mark .
ok , let's bring the warp core on line .
oh , wow .
you ain't seen nothin 'yet .
lf you see any of my crew , give them this .
what is it?
orders to find a quiet corner of north america ... and stay out of history's way .
well , good luck .
to both of us .
you're not leaving , are you?
lily , when i was held captive on the borg ship ... my crew risked everything to save me .
there is ... someone still on this ship ... and i owe him the same .
go and find your friend .
what's wrong , locutus?
isn't this familiar?
organic minds are such fragile things .
how could you forget me so quickly?
we were very close , you and l .
you can still hear our song .
yes , i ...
i remember you .
you were there all the time .
but that ship ... and all the borg on it were destroyed .
you think in such three dimensional terms .
how small you've become .
data understands me .
don't you , data?
what have you done to him?
given him what he always wanted flesh and blood .
let him go .
he's not the one you want .
are you offering yourself to us?
offering myself?
that's it .
i remember now .
it wasn't enough that you assimilate me .
i had to give myself freely to the borg .
to you .
you flatter yourself .
i've overseen the assimilation of countless millions .
you were no different .
you're lying .
you wanted more than just another borg drone .
you wanted a human being with a mind of his own ... who could bridge the gulf between humanity and the borg .
you wanted a counterpart , but i resisted .
i fought you .
you can't begin to imagine the life you denied yourself .
it's not too late .
locutus could still be with you ... just in the way you wanted an equal .
let data go ... and i will take my place at your side ... willingly without any resistance .
such a noble creature ... a quality we sometimes lack .
we will add your distinctiveness to our own .
welcome home ... locutus .
data , you are free to go .
data , go .
no .
i do not wish to go .
as you can see , i have already found an equal .
data , deactivate the self destruct sequence .
data , no .
don't do it .
data , listen to me .
auto destruct sequence deactivated .
now , enter the encryption codes and give me computer control .
data !
data ...
he will make an excellent drone .
plasma injectors are on line .
everything's looking good .
i think we're ready .
they should be out there right now .
we better break the warp barrier in the next five minutes ... if we're gonna get their attention .
nacelles are charged and ready .
let's do it !
engage .
warp field is looking good .
structural integrity is holding .
speed 20, 000 kilometers per second .
sweet jesus !
relax , doctor .
i'm sure they're just here to give us a sendoff .
i am bringing the external sensors on line .
30 seconds to warp threshold .
approaching light speed .
we're at critical velocity .
quantum torpedoes locked .
destroy them .
watch your future's end .
data !
resistance is futile .
aah !
whoa !
aah !
aah !
that should be enough .
throttle back .
take us out of warp .
is that earth?
that's it .
it's so small .
it's about to get a whole lot bigger .
captain .
data .
are you all right?
i would imagine i look worse than l
feel .
strange .
part of me is sorry she is dead .
she was unique .
she brought me closer to humanity ... than i ever thought possible ... and for a time ...
i was tempted by her offer .
how long a time?
zero point six eight seconds , sir .
for an android , that is nearly an eternity .
captain's log , april 5 , 2063 .
captain's log , april 5 , 2063 .
the voyage of the phoenix was a success ... again .
the alien ship detected the warp signature ... and is on its way to rendezvous with history .
my god ... they're really from another world .
and they'll want to meet the man who flew that warp ship .
live long and prosper .
thanks .
i think it's time we made a discreet exit .
riker to enterprise , stand by to beam us up .
you gotta go?
i envy you ... the world you're going to .
i envy you ... taking these first steps into a new frontier .
i shall miss you , lily .
picard to enterprise , energize .
report .
the moon's gravitational field ... obscured our warp signature .
the vulcans did not detect us .
i've reconfigured our warp field ... to match the chronometric readings of the borg sphere .
recreate the vortex , commander .
all decks report ready .
helm standing by .
mr. data , lay in a course for the 24th century .
i suspect our future is there waiting for us .
course laid in , sir .
make it so .
no , no .
it's music .
i'll play you some .
ooby dooby ...
no , no ...
ooby dooby ...
you dance to it .
ooby dooby dooby dooby ...
dooby dooby doo wah doo wah doo wah ...
well , you wiggle to the left ...
you wiggle to the right ...
do the ooby dooby with all your might ...
ooby dooby ...
