hello , mr. michaux !
you're no bother at all !
i'm at the park , practicing my boomerang .
i do it before the office , to relieve stress .
dinner , wednesday evening?
i'd be delighted !
hi !
coming to the game wednesday?
no , i have a dinner party .
charlie .
coffee , please .
what dinner party?
one of our customers invited me .
why you?
at the bank , he stops at my window and chats .
what about?
everything ... politics , entertainment , sports ...
he asks for my opinion and i tell him .
why would he ask an idiot like you?
listen , there'll be big shots at that dinner !
mr. perier says they're very interested in my ideas .
so maybe the idiot isn't me , okay?
that's wonderful !
i'll definitely be there on wednesday , unless something unexpected ...
you coming or going?
going .
to biarritz .
what's in biarritz?
it's my dad's birthday .
say hello for me .
a coffee , please .
you're coming wednesday?
no , i'm busy .
are you going?
sure .
i'm in a bind .
i don't have an idiot .
i've looked all over .
got one on hand?
no , but i'll think about it .
i'm late .
what's that?
dad collects them .
a beauty , huh?
18th century .
he'll love it .
your dad collects ladles?
he has over 300 of them .
he's retired .
keeps him busy .
interesting !
could he discuss his passion in public ,
tell us the story of ladles?
no , pierre .
does he come to paris?
no , pierre , not dad .
what?
it's a very original hobby .
you want him for your dinner?
how can you say that?
i'd take your dad to an idiot dinner?
yes .
you think i'm a bastard , eh?
yes .
i was just kidding .
but i don't have an idiot yet .
i'm panicked .
hi , there .
sorry !
thanks .
sorry , it fell out of my folder .
that's okay .
don't you recognize it?
what?
the eiffel tower !
made of matches .
346, 422 to be exact .
you did that?
one of my finest pieces .
you've done others?
are you kidding?
take the problem of lift .
in this construction , that was the biggest challenge .
but let's start from the beginning .
what is a suspension bridge?
the angle of the matches can't be a tenth of a degree off !
a tenth of a degree , think of it !
the concorde was a different problem .
here's a little quiz .
we've arrived !
which took me longer , eiffel or concorde?
we've arrived !
really?
already?
time did fly !
pierre brochant , please .
this is jean cordier .
pierre?
i've got one !
what's he like?
a world champion !
how's the soccer fan?
marseilles are turds !
marseilles are turds !
auxerre will get it wednesday !
look at that asshole !
sorry , louisette .
i'm used to it .
brochant publishers here .
mr. pignon , please .
speaking .
mr. brochant for you .
mr. pignon?
yes .
my friend jean cordier gave me your number .
you met him on the train .
yes , of course .
he said a lot about you .
i want to meet you .
to meet me?
franois pignon !
he was so awed , he was speechless .
it'll be a delight !
who's michaux bringing?
a boomerang collector .
that's a good one .
priceless , i hear .
how many of us will there be?
10 , with pignon .
it's shaping up .
shit !
what is it?
christine !
did you cancel your dinner?
my god , that's cold !
so , did you cancel?
a sore back needs heat .
dr. sorbier said ice .
you reached him?
in his car .
he'll be here soon .
great .
i need a drink .
a splash of scotch .
did your sore back make you deaf?
no , i didn't cancel .
you're still going to that sinister dinner?
it's great fun .
you think it's sinister ...
don't sulk just because i enjoy it !
come on .
stay with me .
you know i'm not feeling well .
so come with me , for a change .
you'll have a blast .
making fun of some poor guy?
but he's an idiot !
idiots are fair game .
a drink at his place , then dinner .
at a restaurant?
no , his friend has organized a big dinner .
i'm nervous .
which one?
they're the same .
this one's redder .
it's more festive .
mustn't forget my model file .
he wants to do a book !
on my models , you realize?
hurry , you'll be late .
you asked him here?
to study him before dinner .
i hear he's fabulous .
i'll leave you two together .
enjoy !
where are you going?
i have a dinner too .
i didn't want to go , but ...
dinner with whom?
is it him?
i don't want to meet him .
no , it's the doctor .
dr. sorbier .
come on up , doctor .
good evening , doctor .
fix him .
he has an important dinner tonight .
christine !
an idiot dinner .
each regular has to bring an idiot .
christine , please !
the idiots don't know why they've been picked .
the fun is making them talk .
hilarious !
not to me , so i'm leaving .
good night , doctor .
sorry .
i called you to fix my back , not my marriage .
can i wash my hands?
first door on the left .
in college , we used to invite ugly girls .
the ugliest one got a prize .
yes , we did that too .
but idiots are funnier .
but less definite .
some idiots are quite obvious .
mine's unmistakable .
you look great .
thanks , louisette .
have a nice evening .
dazzle them !
a friend of yours?
no .
my friends are not that dumb .
we pick aces .
this is big league .
where do you find them?
it's hard .
a real manhunt .
we have scouts who tip us off .
fifth lumbar vertebra !
is it serious?
no , but call off your dinner .
no !
rest your back tonight .
i'll stop by tomorrow .
but , doctor ...
i have a prime idiot coming !
give me a shot !
i don't care !
anything !
ice bag and rest , or you'll be out for three weeks .
i'm jinxed .
my phone book , please .
the phone .
what's his name again?
franois pignon .
what does he do?
he's a tax man .
isn't that dangerous?
what if he finds out?
he won't .
we're careful .
no idiot ever found out .
he's out .
holy shit !
what?
his message .
he tries to be witty .
it's pathetic .
franois is out , but don't pout !
no need to weep , wait for the beep !
your turn to peep !
isn't he something?
outstanding , i'd say .
here he is .
don't move , i'll get it .
it's franois pignon .
6th floor , on the left .
he's coming .
i'll leave you a sedative .
take two if you're in pain .
wait for him .
it'll be fun .
no .
i'm late .
see you tomorrow .
call me at home if it gets worse .
see you .
leave the door open .
do me a favor .
certainly .
never invite me to dinner .
i'd wonder !
good evening .
evening , sir .
go on in .
it's open .
thanks .
good evening , mr. pignon !
come on in !
i can't get up .
i twisted my back .
we'll have to put off our dinner .
i'm sorry for you .
a sore back is no fun .
it's silly .
what are you doing next wednesday?
next wednesday ... nothing .
my friend's giving another dinner .
you're invited .
how very nice .
we missed you today .
we won't miss you next week . ... l'm talking about the authentic boomerang , not those you find in sydney souvenir stores .
the primitive boomerang of proud aboriginal warriors , that boomerang has a dynamism , a motion when it's thrown correctly , that is miraculous !
how are you?
not too hot .
i'm a wreck .
it's a real shame .
sit down .
no , it won't be possible tonight .
we haven't sat down to dinner yet , so ...
it can behead a kangaroo from 150 feet !
okay , but don't count on us .
yes , he's here .
very nice .
he looks like a real winner .
no , i'll bring him over next week .
bye !
so how are you , mr. pignon?
very well .
thanks .
the message on your machine is so witty .
really?
i wanted it to be original .
i'm still laughing .
everybody comments on it .
friends ask me to record their messages .
i can see why .
i could do yours ...
no need .
it'd take a minute .
no , it's fine as it is , even if it might be a little conservative for you .
i'm delighted to meet you .
likewise .
since you called me at the ministry ,
i've been walking on air .
i thought it was a joke .
did i sound dumb on the phone?
yes ...
i mean , no .
you were perfect .
a big publisher wanting to do a book on my models , inviting me to dinner ... you've changed my life .
the book project isn't quite final yet ...
i brought photos of my finest pieces .
the eiffel tower .
superb .
took me eight months .
it shows .
you do them at night?
and on weekends .
whenever i have time .
are you married?
yes ...
i mean , no .
the tancarville bridge .
great !
so are you married or not?
well ...
my wife left me .
she did?
for a friend of mine .
those things happen .
a guy i knew at the ministry .
not a bad guy .
i invited him home .
she fell for him .
i don't know why , because he's no genius .
you know how many matches in this one?
what do you mean , no genius?
the guy she ran off with .
what a dumbbell !
come on , say a number .
dumber than ...
i mean , you're pretty smart , so how would he rate against you?
sorry to be so blunt , but he's quite the idiot !
my god !
so?
how could she run off with an idiot?
i agree .
he only talks about windsurfing !
can i meet him?
you like windsurfing?
i love it .
then you'll love benjamin !
we call him dumbo .
he's in the phone book .
under benjamin , not dumbo .
so , how many matches?
2, 000?
346, 422 !
that's not all .
how many tubes of glue?
we're going to that dinner !
you can walk?
i'll try .
you got a car?
sure .
if you drive , we'll manage .
help me up .
here we go .
you okay?
take it easy .
37 !
what?
37 tubes of glue .
we'll have a wonderful evening , mr. pignon !
i'm so sorry .
are you hurt?
there might be broken bones .
now what?
a chiropractor !
no need .
a buddy of mine .
he's great .
i don't need him !
he's the best in courbevoie .
i don't want him !
go home , i'll be fine .
what about dinner?
it's off .
i'm in no shape now !
the machine's on .
we're out .
speak after the beep .
your message is a bit flat .
it's me .
i won't be coming home tonight .
i may never come home again .
sorry to tell you this on a machine , but maybe it's best .
goodbye , pierre .
i'll be going now .
sure you don't need anything?
yes .
everything's fine .
good night .
sorry ...
i forgot my briefcase .
i'm with you , mr. brochant .
all the way !
thanks a lot .
goodbye .
goodbye .
what can i do for you?
nothing .
i'm fine .
good night .
i really know what you're going through .
i'd like to be left alone !
i said that when she left me , and i nearly died of grief alone in my house .
plus , you've got a bad back .
she hasn't left me .
she's a bit depressed .
she'll be back .
now go home , and good night !
she'll be back .
that's what i said for two years .
i'm off to bed .
turn out the lights .
can't i call my chiropractor buddy?
no !
he's great .
and cheap .
know what he charges for house calls?
i'm with pr .
sorbier of the west side hospital .
i don't need your buddy !
yours may be good , but look at you now !
because you fell on me !
why do i even argue with this jerk?
you're like a horse that missed a jump .
at the track , they'd put you out of your misery .
go away , mr. pignon !
this could be dangerous .
if the spinal marrow is affected , you might get paralyzed .
then , you'll need quite the miracle !
call sorbier !
that's better !
what's his number?
look in that book .
pr .
sorbier , please .
for pierre brochant .
pierre brochant?
i need the doctor right away .
there's no doctor here .
sorry , i dialed a wrong number .
i skipped a line .
the handwriting's so tiny .
who cares? !
just hang up !
yes , i'm at his place .
yes , he's here .
no , he's in pretty bad shape .
he's got a bad back .
he can't move , he's spread out on the floor
like a sack of potatoes .
who are you talking to?
who am i talking to?
really?
then i can tell you he's in very bad shape .
his wife left him , too .
he's broken , body and soul !
stop that !
i must go .
he's about to lose it .
bye !
it was your sister !
i don't have a sister .
you don't?
i said , " who is this?
she said , " his sister .
he called marlene !
she's not your sister?
her name is marlene hissister !
how could i know?
she said , " marlene , his sister .
it's confusing .
give me that phone .
hurry !
if my wife's gone , she'll come running .
all i need is a nymphomaniac !
she's a nympho , too?
oh , my !
stop it , will you?
if i call , she'll go on for hours !
tell her my wife's back .
hurry , damn it !
my wife's back , everything's well .
really?
that's what you say !
right , sorry .
marlene hissister !
marlene hissister?
it's me again .
i'm calling to say mrs. brochant came home .
yes , a moment ago .
she's fine , mr. brochant is fine , everybody's fine .
his back is sore , but he's taking it better .
say goodbye !
i'm not really a friend of his .
he likes my models .
i make matchstick models of engineering feats ... the tancarville bridge , the golden gate bridge ...
she doesn't care !
she's very interested !
don't tie up my phone line !
sorry , i have to go now .
he needs me and in his shape , i can't leave him alone .
oh my god !
alone?
his wife isn't back?
what?
sure she's back ... but she stepped out .
she hasn't walked out , she stepped out ... to throw out the garbage .
what is this?
aries , with gemini ascending .
aries don't lie .
i'm not lying .
enough !
i'll be right over .
she said , " i'll be right over , " and hung up .
give me that phone !
sorry , i played it too cool .
i didn't expect her to be so cunning .
it's you , darling .
i'll drop off the dogs and be right over .
don't !
my wife'll be home any minute .
don't come over !
sorry , but i doubt she'll be returning .
know what i think?
she's back with leblanc .
leblanc?
why even bring him up?
it's over between them !
i say she's with no one !
please stay home tonight , okay?
that nut won't listen !
you can go now .
i need to be alone .
can i help you to your room?
you can't sleep on the floor !
get me to the sofa .
slowly .
look ahead .
they're all alike , eh?
what?
i gather yours ran off with someone too .
she ran off with nobody .
mine ran off with nobody , also , because benjamin is a nobody .
but she still ran off with him !
hadn't we said goodbye?
yes , i'll be off .
i'll get you some water for the pills , then i'll leave .
is he a friend of yours?
go to hell !
briefcase !
when you asked about my life , i didn't say " go to hell .
farewell , mr. brochant .
leblanc was my best friend .
we quarreled two years ago .
okay?
over what?
he made a pass at your wife?
no , i stole her from him .
he lived with christine .
she left him for me .
they wrote a novel together and brought it to me .
then what?
i took both the novel and christine .
all you windsurfers steal your friends 'wives?
i'm no windsurfer !
give me a break !
but you told me ...
i don't do it enough to swipe my friends '... what am i saying?
is your curiosity satisfied?
why don't you call him?
who?
him .
to see if she's with him !
i call and say , " did the woman i stole come back?
at least , you'd know .
i called benjamin and asked , " have you left with florence?
he said yes and hung up .
at least i knew .
what if i called him?
you?
i can say , " i'm a friend of mrs. brochant's ,
where can i reach her?
and he won't suspect a thing !
i'm just trying to help .
thanks , but she's not with him .
i need rest .
i won't insist .
good night !
mr. pignon?
yes?
if i tell you exactly what to say , could you do it?
sometimes i feel like you think i'm an idiot .
of course i can !
what do i say?
we could use the book they wrote .
tell him you're a movie producer .
you've read the book and want the movie rights .
good idea !
then casually , you ask about his co author .
what co author?
my wife !
he wrote it with her !
right .
i'm sorry .
it'll never work !
it will !
it's not easy , but i got it .
not easy?
you're a producer , okay?
you have a company in paris .
no , he knows everybody here .
foreign .
american?
german?
belgian !
that's it !
why belgian?
it suits you .
you're a belgian producer , you read " the merry go round , " and want to buy the movie rights , okay?
is it a good book?
it's awful .
why?
it bothers me .
why?
if it's awful , why do i want the rights?
mr. pignon?
you're not a producer , are you?
no .
you're not belgian , either?
no .
so you're not calling about the book , you're calling about my wife !
that's tricky , but clever as hell !
what's his number?
01 . 47 . 45 ... never mind , i'll dial it .
his name is juste leblanc .
he has no first name?
i told you , juste leblanc .
leblanc's his name , juste his first name .
mr. pignon , your first name's franois .
just think his is juste .
we're wasting time .
my wife wrote under her maiden name , le guirrec .
she's from brittany?
please , stay focused !
sorry .
at the end , ask him where you can contact christine le guirrec .
i'll put on the loudspeaker .
go to it .
with a belgian accent?
can i talk to mr. juste leblanc?
speaking .
good evening , mr. leblanc ,
george van brueghel here , sorry to bother you so late .
i'm a belgian producer , i just got in from belgium , and i'm very interested in your novel ...
the merry go round " !
i'd like to discuss buying the movie rights .
is this a joke?
not at all , why?
etienne?
what?
cut it out , i know it's you .
you're mistaken .
i'm not etienne , i'm a producer from brussels .
what company?
sorry?
what's your company called?
flatland films .
a young , but dynamic company .
and you're interested in my novel?
very interested .
for a movie or tv?
a movie .
a movie , for the big screen .
not the small box !
i want to do the screenplay myself .
no problem .
but we're a small company with limited budgets .
if you're not too greedy ...
what about my wife?
we'll talk money later .
when can i meet you , mr ...?
van breughel ...
my wife !
i'll call tomorrow for a meeting .
talk to you tomorrow .
talk to you tomorrow !
there !
we have the rights !
and for peanuts , i'd say !
he fell for it , he did !
what about my wife?
what?
he forgot about my wife !
he yaps for five minutes and forgets about my wife !
i blew it !
this tops my wildest dreams !
indeed , i blew it .
this is record breaking !
i'll call back .
give me that phone !
i'll say , " how can i reach your co author ,
christine le guirrec?
give me that phone !
too bad , we were about to find out .
you'll say , " how can i reach your co author , christine le guirrec?
and no more . ... some guy with an appalling accent .
van brueghel .
his company's called flatland films .
i never heard of it , either ...
hold on , someone's calling on the other line .
sorry to disturb you , it's van breughel again .
my agent's on the other line .
i'll call you .
what's your number?
01 . 45 . 90 . 56 . 03 .
he cut me off .
i did , you idiot !
idiot?
you gave him my phone number !
sure , he wants to call me back .
you never stop , do you?
sorry , i'm out of my depth .
i'm doing my best , but ...
world class !
maybe the world champion !
it's ringing !
it's ringing , and he's happy !
he's calling .
don't we answer?
we're out , speak after the beep .
pierre , it's juste .
i wondered about the belgian weirdo , then realized you're looking for your wife .
ask me yourself , without the accent .
bye .
juste?
it's me .
where is she?
i've waited two years for this .
but i feel sorry for you .
don't .
just tell me if she's with you .
she called to say she'd left you .
she was very upset .
did she say where she was going?
no .
where could she be?
it's painful , huh?
you know exactly how i feel .
but i've got a bad back , too !
no kidding?
you'd laugh if you saw me ... bent over , unable to move .
you want me to stop by?
thanks , but i'd rather be alone .
thanks again .
you don't have to , but if she calls you again ...
i'll call you , i promise .
thanks .
i don't deserve a friend like you .
hand me that pad , please .
put this on the door .
i've taken a sedative ,
i'm asleep ,
i need to be alone tonight .
i hope she won't bug me !
shall i wait for her?
you stay in your room , and i'll stand guard .
you've done enough !
i know i goofed on the phone .
i'm really sorry .
i truly want to help you .
just help me to bed .
if you feel depressed , call me and i'll be back in a second !
no !
you know what i lacked most when mine left?
a friend to hold my hand .
goodbye .
miss hissister !
this is for you .
we spoke on the phone .
aries , with gemini ascending .
i dialed your number by mistake .
then i realized you're his girlfriend .
his girlfriend?
yes .
sorry i was a little confusing .
but it's very simple .
his wife left him , but he doesn't care .
he's asleep and can't be disturbed .
got that?
perfectly .
i'll have a word with him !
marlene !
may i call you marlene?
please .
i haven't known him long , but i understand him .
so take my advice .
i'm listening .
give it time .
his wife just left , so don't rush in .
be the sensuous , amusing mistress you are , all garter belts and champagne .
keep on seeing him three to four times a week , wait for your turn .
he'll fall when it's due .
he said he saw me three to four times a week?
i felt he'd see you every day if he could .
so don't insist .
go home , it's your best move .
you're right , i won't wake him .
good move !
i have the feeling he'll soon be at your door with flowers .
was he taking you to a dinner party?
yes .
did he mention me?
even if he hadn't , i would have guessed .
nice work !
i saw the light was on and figured you weren't asleep .
you still here?
thank god i am !
why?
we had a visitor .
who?
the nutcase .
marlene?
she just left .
she was about to force your door .
you're lucky a guy called pignon told her " keep out !
you got rid of marlene?
yes .
i don't want to brag , but i was pretty cool .
i was sweet , but firm .
got rid of her fast .
you won't see her again !
that's good news .
a pity , because she's a real looker .
what does she do?
she's a writer .
another one?
you sleep with all your authors?
none of your fucking business .
maybe not , but i think it isn't nice .
i never cheated on my wife .
and the ministry of finance is a bunny hutch !
leave me alone now .
it never ends !
who is it?
it's mr. leblanc .
you came .
i felt bad leaving you alone .
he wasn't alone .
i took care of him .
yes , and now you're leaving !
i'm off .
i'll leave my pictures with you .
thank you , but , no thank you .
they're models i make with matches .
here's one of my finest ...
he's not here to talk about models .
sure .
take your photos , i'm in no mood right now .
what are you up to now?
still writing .
and i've already got a published .
what do you write?
we'll talk later .
i have bad news .
she called .
she was torn between coming here and making a huge mistake .
i tried to convince her , but ...
what mistake?
going to meneaux's place .
what?
pascal meneaux , from the advertising company .
she must be there now .
no !
yes .
he's wooed her for weeks , and tonight she ...
aren't you done?
i'm filing them chronologically ...
do that at home !
okay !
meneaux's the worst !
that's why she went .
she's mad at you .
that two cent romeo .
she's crazy !
mine picked a real dummy !
get out of here !
good night , mr. brochant .
where does he live?
he has a love nest ,
but as to the address ...
good night , mr. leblanc .
it's very secret .
no one knows it .
good night , mr. brochant !
good night !
there must be a way to find it !
meneaux had a tax audit !
pascal meneaux , advertizing .

i'd have to call cheval , and i'd hate to .
he's watching soccer on tv .
an oil derrick .

beau derrick .
after the actress bo derek !
beau derrick , bo derek !

it's a big game !
who cares?

what nut?
i'll be back .
what did you say to her?

i have a serious problem !
pierre , listen to me .
marlene , go away !
i cram three dogs in my car to come over , and you throw me out?
scram , before it gets nasty !

it's the smart thing to do .
he tossed out my wife !
i'm really sorry .
he drove her straight into meneaux's arms !
okay , i goofed .
but anybody would have made that mistake .

you're not his type !
what?
he likes big boobs and hates hairy legs !
he's so funny !
it's serious .
i need that address .
why do you need it?
it's for a friend who thinks his wife is there .
at meneaux's?
his wife's there?
poor bastard !
see why i need the address?
you bet !
i've watched meneaux !
any skirt drives him dingo !
talk about a pig !

i doubt it .

no .
no .
what's the address?
i can't tell you now .

you okay?
much better .
the pills helped .
we've got to tape the game for that retard .
cheval's no retard .
he's our best inspector .
let him loose in this apartment , and he'll strip it !
it might not be a good idea to let a tax inspector into your home !
you told him i was your friend !
he wouldn't go to work on me !
cheval would audit his own mother !
is that a copy?
if you're clean , if your artworks were declared , you'll be fine .
what'll we feed him?
i've got frozen stuff and eggs .
i'll make him a nice omelet !
give me a hand .
watch your back .
where do we put it?
we'll put everything in my room .
stop laughing !
that idiot managed to drive your wife to adultery and to get you audited !
what's that wine?
lafitte rothschild '78 .
don't serve him such expensive wine !
that's all i have .
no table wine?
no !
i've worked like a dog so i wouldn't have to drink cheap wine !
i only have great wines !
or water !
does cheval know about wine?
you bet he does !
you opened a fine bottle .
he'll like that !
hear that?
we've got a problem !
i'll solve it .
just you wait !
it has aroma .
what are you doing?
i'm putting vinegar in my lafitte .
now we have cheap wine .
there !
a wino's delight !
taste it !
you taste it !
no , thanks .
weird ... it has more body .
damn !
it hasn't ruined it .
i'd say it's better .

that's good to know !
that should do it !
no !
yes !

lucien cheval .
pierre brochant , juste leblanc .
mr. cheval , thank you for ...
don't tell me !
what?
the soccer score .
all i can say is that it's a tie .

no , i was kidding !
what an idiot !
isn't he an idiot?
you should have seen the look on your face !
he's so happy now !
i made his evening !
we're in a hurry .
you got the address?
he's the man i told you about .

the address is in here .
i'm starving .
i made you a nice omelet .
you'll love it !

yes .
so where's this love nest?
i audited a michel brochant three years ago .
are you related?
could be .
where does he live?
in jail .
he got five years .
nice guy .
had a fancy place like yours , that we auctioned off !
where's that fuck nest?
let me look through all this stuff !
advertising is quite lucrative !
what's your thing , mr. brochant?
publishing .
very profitable , too !
please , the address .
st. james st ... that's his home address .
where is that love nest?
here's your omelet !
thanks , franois .
an good little table wine .
a bit coarse , but i get it for cheap .
let's try this omelet .
what's wrong?
a masterpiece , franois !
he's so silly .
thanks , lucien .
light , unctuous ...
my secret's a few drops of beer in the eggs ...
the address , damn it !
lincoln st ... that's his office ...
temple st ... that's not it either .
you been attached?
no , why?
those light patches ... paintings have been removed .
he doesn't miss a trick !
you're fabulous , lucien !
you came to help or audit him?
he came to help !
right?
hurry !
poor mr. brochant is in a fix !
yeah , poor mr. brochant ...
sure , meneaux's quite the jerk , but as we say , " dogs only go for bitches !
here we are .
barrs st. near the park .
37 barrs st.
in neuilly .
great !
i'm off .
wait , make sure she's there !
don't go till you're sure of it .
he won't open the door .
he's sneaky .
i'll kick it open .
what if she's not there?
then what?
we could call him .
to ask if my wife's in his bed , snug under his quilt?
under his quilt !
are you done?
you had a knickknack there !
i can see the dust ring .
i told you , he's a real pro .
bravo , lucien !
you'll make me blush .
don't be so modest !
you've busted many others !
we've got the address .
kick 'em out !
stop it , please !
i've got an idea .
listen to this .
we scare meneaux to make him come clean .
how?
you call and say you know everything , you're coming to wreck his place with three tough guys .
not bad .
we'll know right away by the way he reacts .
a fine strategy !
i can't call him .
he knows my voice !
he knows mine , too .
and mine .
i'm with him all day .
i think i'm going to be needed !
oh , no !
only he can do it !
i really feel up to it !
we'll coach him , and he'll do fine .
just wait and see !
if you don't want me to help ...
but who would tell us to call him?
someone who'd have the number to his love nest .
his partner , roussin , would .
they're very close .
roussin it is .
why wouldn't he call himself?
why wouldn't roussin call?
lt'll seem odd .
meneaux told me he's heading to la tonight .
perfect !
we're calling for roussin who's on a plane .
great !
got the strategy?
it's simple .
he has to rehearse !
a lot !
one hell of a lot !
sit down .
repeat after me ,
i'm calling for mr. roussin .
he's on a plane , but has a message for you .
okay .
no , repeat it .
pretend i'm meneaux and repeat what i said .
i've got it !
please , repeat precisely .
hello , i'm calling for mr. roussin .
he's on a plane , and has a message for you .
perfect !
not yet .
you add , " brochant knows everything .
no , repeat it !
come on , he's not stupid !
brochant knows everything .
then you say , " he knows about his wife .
if meneaux asks who's speaking , you say ,
a friend of roussin's .
brochant's coming with three pals .
he's with three of his toughest pals .
he's talented !
i'm just parroting .
he's excellent !
could i improvise a bit?
no !
don't shout !
you scared me !
just stick to what i told you !
come on , we're wasting time !
what's the number?
01 . 47 . 47 . 39 . 63 .
here we go !
i'm scared .
the strategy's fine .
i'm worried about the executor .
it's ringing !
loudspeaker !
hopefully , they haven't done it yet .
why is he not answering?
he's too busy !
pascal meneaux?
yes .
he sounds tired .
that's bad .
that's a bad sign .
sorry to bother you .
i'm calling on behalf of mr. roussin .
yes?
he's on a plane , but he has a message for you .
go ahead .
brochant knows everything .
what?
he's coming to wreck your place !
nice going .
who is this?
a friend of roussin's .
brochant's coming over , and not alone .
he's with three of his toughest pals .
he's crazy !
his wife's not here !
you're not with her?
she canceled out .
roussin said , " he's with mrs. brochant .
not at all .
i'm with the wife of guy who's auditing me !
what?
the jerk's hounded me for months .
i'm screwing his wife , not mrs. brochant !
may i use your phone?
certainly .
she went shopping this afternoon .
i asked her to take a form to meneaux's office .
and bingo !
good evening , mr. meneaux .
could i speak to mrs. cheval , please?
you know who i am .
we're meeting tomorrow at 9 : 00 , as usual .
we'll review your whole case .
now let me speak to my wife .
charlotte?
don't try to explain .
leave that place at once !
of course you can put your clothes back on !
i'm not alone .
i can't talk now .
we'll talk at home .
charlotte !
i did tape the ice skating show for you .
that wine ...
it is a bit coarse .
i'm going to puke !
the bathroom !
here , lucien !
first door on the left !
i said " on the left .
interesting room !
a storage room , where i keep my old things .
it's awful , but i don't care !
what is?
he's a tax dodger , and i don't care !
get a hold of yourself .
run home and take a shower .
want the tape of the soccer game?
i'm in no mood for that .
goodbye , mr. leblanc .
goodbye , mr. cheval .
goodbye , mr. brochant .
thanks for all your help .
don't mention it .
we'll meet again soon .
i'm going to audit you .
all this is suspect .
he recovered pretty fast !
where can she be?
i'll go home .
if she calls , i'll call .
thanks .
goodbye , mr. pignon .
goodbye .
is everyone leaving?
yes , you can leave too .
yes?
speaking .
i'm her husband .
is something wrong?
which hospital?
i'm coming !
she had a car accident .
she's at the hospital .
is it serious?
just a concussion ,
but they're keeping her overnight .
i could drive you .
no , thanks .
pierre , it's me .
i know you're there .
you're not being nice .
you promised to leave your wife .
look how you treat me now !
answer me !
i need you .
i'm not well !
pick up the phone !
if you don't , i'll do something silly !
his wife had an accident .
he's at the hospital .
an accident?
it's not serious , but ...
serves him right !
don't say that , marlene .
serves him right !
he's mean !
his wife's in the hospital , and i'll kill myself .
don't kill yourself .
try to understand , it's been hell ...
he's a bastard !
fuck , my glass ...
look at that mess .
why did i fall for that bastard?
sorry , i have to hang up .
don't hang up !
talk to me .
it makes me feel better .
hang up !
she's suicidal .
it's blackmail .
where are my keys?
don't do anything silly !
swear you won't !
you're nice .
but he's a bastard !
one hell of a bastard !
don't say that .
he's so mean !
even in his way of having fun !
i have to go .
if he hadn't hurt his back , he'd be making fun of some guy .
what do you mean?
hang up !
didn't he tell you?
every week , they hold a dinner game .
they invite idiots and make fun of them all night !
let's go !
your briefcase .
quick .
i'm in a hurry .
mr. brochant .
yes?
what was tonight's dinner for?
for friends who admired your work !
let's go !
were there other guests?
let's talk in the elevator .
what kind of guests?
why these questions?
how do you pick your guests?
get to the point .
was i invited to your dinner for idiots?
it's you , darling .
i was just leaving .
how are you?
what do you mean?
i love you , and i won't leave you alone !
i've learned a lot tonight .
i need you !
to hell with her !
she's not my girlfriend !
that retard made it up !
i'm coming .
we'll talk it over , okay?
the retard is leaving .
did you invite me to a dinner for idiots?
look , in one evening , you've avenged all the idiots who ever attended our dinners .
good night , mr. pignon .
she's right .
you're mean .
so i'm mean !
my wife says it , and everyone agrees ...
i'm mean .
you can put it on my answering machine ,
brochant is a meanie !
don't mix sedatives and alcohol .
why not?
it's the moral of the story ...
brochant the meanie gets drunk alone in his big place , while nice pignon goes home saying , " the bastard got punished !
brochant's a meanie , pignon's a beanie !
now what?
i need the number to the west side hospital .
he's at it again !
thanks .
you won't get her .
it's a public hospital .
west side hospital .
mrs. christine brochant , please .
she was in a car accident .
no calls for patients after 6 : 00 pm .
call tomorrow .
there you go !
i must speak to mrs. brochant .
this is pr .
sorbier .
sorry , sir .
please hold on .
i'm in a rush , dear .
hurry !
mrs. brochant for you , professor .
thanks , dear .
stop this farce .
she just hung up on me .
pr .
sorbier for you .
thanks .
mrs. brochant?
yes , doctor .
i'm not pr .
sorbier .
who is this?
i'm your husband's idiot .
what?
we briefly met .
my name's pignon ,
i'm your husband's idiot for that dinner .
i'm listening .
i just found out why i was invited , and i'm in a state of shock .
you were in a crash , and so was i !
hello?
yes , i'm here .
i'm not calling because i feel sorry for myself .
i feel sorry for him .
he may not be the meanest of men , but he's the unhappiest .
i heard you tell him not to visit you .
he was so lost , so miserable , that i forgot i was the idiot and decided to call .
mrs. brochant?
yes?
my wife left me two years ago .
that day , my life was shattered .
i survived by making my models , but deep down , i'm still a wreck .
i wish that on no one , not even your husband .
is he there?
what?
he's feeding you the lines of this moving drama?
i swear it was my idea to call you .
he fed me nothing .
is he beside you?
no , i'm in a phone booth .
he doesn't love me .
he loves no one .
mrs. brochant , for two hours ,
i saw your husband try to find you .
he even called pascal meneaux , who was in the arms of a woman who wasn't you !
he called meneaux?
he did .
you can't imagine what he did out of love for you .
he made up with his best friend , dumped his girlfriend .
he even braved a tax inspector !
he tidied up his whole life , in an exemplary way .
now he's alone in his big apartment , mixing alcohol and pills .
i'm worried about him .
i know one can die of love , mrs. brochant .
i'll think it over .
thanks for calling .
don't mention it .
goodbye .
she'll call back .
mr. pignon?
yes?
we're going to the next dinner .
but this time , you're taking me !
and i'll win first prize .
i'm exhausted .
being smart is very tiring .
i'll try it sometime .
promise me one thing .
just ask .
think twice before you call anyone an idiot .
i promise .
i swear .
here he is , mrs. brochant !
i thought you were in a phone booth .
you idiot !
no , i'm back at his place .
what an idiot !
i can explain !
what an idiot !
i'll call her back !
i'll call her back , it'll be fine !
what an idiot !
