hello?
hello?
martin?
martin?
thank god you" re here .
oh , my god , martin , what are you doing?
here , l" il give you a hand .
what happened to you?
i was attacked .
were you bitten?
no .
good .
which way is to the nearest town?
i need to get to a telephone .
the nearest town" s not for miles .
be nighttime before you got there , anyway .
i wouldn" t fancy being out here at nighttime .
not now .
i need to call for help .
you" re wasting your time .
i mean , there" s more to this than just your problem .
from what l" ve seen this morning ... half the countryside" s been attacked .
those things are everywhere .
we could hide out at my cottage ... until we can figure out a way to raise some help .
look , l" m not from around here .
do you have any idea what" s going on?
that" s a good question .
well , there was reports of an infection spreading ... around here .
i saw it on the tv , there , a few days ago .
apparently some farmer ... was feeding dead animal remains to his cattle .
after a few days , the tables turned ... and the herds started attacking each other .
in some cases , the farmers , as well .
then the government came in and wiped out all the herds .
that" s why you won" t see a cow around here for miles .
that" s probably got something to do with it , i think .
jesus .
we better make a move .
so , where is this cottage of yours?
about 21/ 2 miles away .
up the road , through a gate , and straight on .
that" s the quickest way .
come on .
are you coming?
do you know how many have been infected?
l" m not sure .
must be spreading quickly , though .
i came across about 4 or 5 of them before i ran into you .
l" m desmond , by the way .
helena .
l" m the local gravedigger .
never leave the gate open .
we crashed into somebody on the road .
and that person bite him .
and when i went to get some help ...
and the next thing is , he was trying to kill me .
this is place is known as the valley of the hanging trees .
one farmer who was here in the 17th century ... hanged 50 women and children .
l" d really ...
i mean ...
i don" t want to be bad with you or anything like that .
but the countryside is just not my thing , you know?
oh , now , that" s not fair .
wait for me .
run .
now .
what?
helena !
come here !
helena !
this is fenham abbey .

they don" t care .
l" m not going that way .
you must be crazy .
you" re gonna have to ... because we" ve got to get to my house now .
one mile that way .
that" s it .
what about if we go over that hill there?
and walk through a dark forest like that?
no way .
one mile straight on there to my house .
10 seconds to get by these fuckers here .
grand .
come on .
no place like home , huh?
no place like home .
so , this is your place?
yeah .
hold on there .

what do you want?
desmond !
what do you want?

jeez .

yeah .

she" s going .
grand .
now l" m fucking lazy , huh?
is there something wrong with that one back there?
there" s something not fucking right about it .
there" s something wrong with that one .
we" il have to watch it .
how " bout we take that chip off your fucking shoulder?
you hear me?
keep your eye out now , francie .
we" re on an open road .
it" s the gorse bushes .
you want to watch the gorse bushes .
part of the gorse , yeah .
they" il be haven from the gorse .
safer on the road .
so , the plan with us is to get to the next town over ...
kilfinnan .
we" re after coming through now 2 , maybe 3 parishes ... on the way over .
all you could see were the ghouls .
now , we" il have better luck next town over .
won" t have happened there .
we" re not too far now from mrs. bonnie" s homestead .
do you remember mrs. bonnie , francie?
i remember mrs. bonnie .
jesus christ .
you" il know mrs. bonnie .
you" il be seeing her around , l" m sure .
you" d smell her if you didn" t see her .
she" d be getting into the van .
she" d be telling you she" s only herself to look after ... and she was doing grand ... and you" d be there with your nose closed ... for fear of the smell of the piss off her .
rat bastards .
ordinarily say they" re better off dead .
you wonder what be scraping through their heads .
when did you see the first one?
first we saw , we were out burning heather ... in the back field on our own place .
nice .
looked up there yonder .
francie saw padre o" brien coming towards us .
we could not have known .
it has often happened .
a strange look off him , though .
took the head off and burnt the thing .
l" ve known him now 20 years .
wasn" t a way to think to do either .
but never a situation or epidemic quite as serious as ... as the one we witnessed today .
dr. hamitill there from oakel agricultural center .
we are receiving current reports of widespread mayhem ... believed to be connected to a recent outbreak ... of a mutated strain of mad cow disease .
keshcarrigan , kilfinnan , carrick on shannon ...
ballinamore , and leitrim village .
these areas are to be avoided at all costs .
however , any citizens in need of assistance ... should make their way to the castle fort ...
iocated on the outskirts of lobinstown .
a rescue team will be located there ... within the next 6 to 8 hours ... to lead any non infected people to ...
nothing .
just static .
just ... they" re knocking down .
try the number 3 there .
nothing on 3 , either .
kilfinnan operator" s normally at that number .
nothing there at all .
what" s on the road?
huh?
jesus christ .
it" s one of the ghouls .
go on , francie .
go on .
we" il help her .
go on .
hang on to the back there .
come on , you fucker !
go for him !
go on , cathal .
speed up .
go on now , go .
we have her .
go on .
the sports of ireland !
did you fucking see that?
good man .
if you knew her , you wouldn" t recognize her .
i took half the jaw off of her there with the hurl .
i can" t believe they" re off the radio .
i can" t work it out .
static is all we" re getting .
static on it .
politicians .
how is it the politicians?
they" ve cut us off .
why have they cut us off?
cause they don" t want anyone to know what" s going on .
going on?
so they" ve given up on the county of leitrim?
now , francie , you" re dreaming that up .
your head" s up your hole .
the light" s working .
aye , it is .
sorry .
it" s ok .
it" s good to know it works , though .
it" s really dark outside .
when i was a young fella , i used to hate it .
i was terrified of the dark .
ah , she" s so lucky , isn" t she?
i wish i could sleep like that .
are you all right?
yeah .
just tired .
yeah .
i bet you didn" t expect ... this shite this morning , did you?
i know what it" s like to be scared , though .
you know , when you" re a child , and ...
i used to be scared of going to sleep .
i used to have those horrible nightmares every night .
right .
so i used to spend all my nights just reading comics .
it works , though .
don" t go to sleep .
stay sharp .
you know , i was so lucky i bumped into you today .
i bumped into you .
oh , you did .
i left a bruise on your arse ... the size of a fucking melon , l" d say .
there" s nothing .
it" s just dead .
helena !
jesus christ !
get her off !
get her off , for fuck" s sake !
the little devil" s about to bite me .
get her off her !
open the fucking door !
get her off her !
look at her !
get her out !
fuck !
what" s that happening there?
the child had the ghoul in her the whole time !
fucking children !
swerve it .
we" re all right back there .
swerve .
we" re stuck .
huh?
we" re stuck .
oh , bollocks .
right .
we" il have to get out and push .
we" re dead meat now .
look , just get out of the car and push .
they" re trying to kill us all .
trying to kill you?
what did you think it was ... a fucking summer camp you were at?
we" re stuck .
you" il have to get out and push .
come on .

come on .
mr. cheunt , i say we keep going a wee bit .
all right .
come on .

time and fucking place .
princess , come on .
on your count , francie .
go for it .
one , 2 , 3 .
push .
it won" t budge .
it" s only gonna endanger us ... here with our asses fucking swung out in the wind .
it" s banjaxed .
what does that mean?
fucked .
moriarty , how far are we to the fort?
lobinstown is about 5 miles that way .
how long?
5 miles ... on foot .
3 hours .
3 hours in the dark?
you" re talking about 5 , at least .
l" m not walking 3 hours in the dark .
i don" t think we have a choice here now .
with all those ghouls around?
are you crazy?
i know .
l" m not moving .
l" m afraid l" m not much of a mechanic .
i think we" il have to walk it .
we have little choice .
come on .
don" t give me that now .
cause we" il go down the side ...
where was it , desmond?
yes , well , l" m not walking .
we have to walk .
there" s no choice .
it" s a rock and a hard fucking place .
l" m not walking anywhere .
get your jacket on .
l" m not walking .
come on .
shh !
quiet .
oh , you folks , we" ve got company .
what?
oh , bollocks !

come on .
quiet .
get in .
come on .
quick .
close the door .
lock it .
fuck off , all of you .
fuck off !
fuck off .
fuck off !
they" re gone .
what was that?
that was a cow .
it couldn" t be .
why not?
they" re all dead .
all gone .
that" s a cow .
seems to be .
if there" s cows around , it means we" re out of the county .
which means we" re away from the mad cow disease .
we might be closer to getting out the wee thing .
who" s gonna cart her to you?
no one" s fucking sensing nothing .
just stand there , eat the grass , and shit it out of you .
mad cow" s a bit different , though .
take the fucking throat off you .
is that true?
no .
that" s a lot closer .
jesus !
think it" s gone?
anything happening there?
no .
cathal , help !
quick .
go back .
what the fuck is he doing?
get yourself fucking killed !
come on !

they" re not done .

christ !

you must be freezing .
be still .
do you hear that?
what?
shh .
do you hear that?
check it out .
i think they" re sleeping .
it is only a scarecrow .
come on .
stay where you are .
the fucking torch is fucked .
oh , christ .
no one" s any batteries , no?
oh ... yeah .
hold on a minute now ... and l" il fucking fetch them for you .
just stop your smart comments .
how far are we from this fucking fort?
not too far .
i say we stay put .
we build a fire .
a couple of hours downtime .
l" ve a grand bottle of whiskey there .
a couple of drinks .
soothe the fucking nerves .
get up in a couple of hours , get to that fort .
you have whiskey?
i have a drop of whiskey .
that sounds nice .
right , so .
that" s it .
they say every time someone dies , a new star appears .
there are lots of stars in the sky tonight .
she wasn" t religious , you know?
i wasn" t , either .
just didn" t see it , you know?
she needed some consolation toward the end .
you made a great couple .
i met her in dublin .
i was playing on the minor team , and we went up ... for the all lreland final .
i went and broke my leg .
i was stuck in a hospital in dublin .
didn" t know if l" d ever play hurling again .
she says that was the end of the world .
was she a nurse?
she was .

and you" re scared of nothing
least that" s what you always boast
take a ride with me
let me educate your mind
yeah , walk with me , and we" il see what we can find
into the darkened forest
where the mist is thick as blood
there lurks an evil i set free
and though it" s way past supper
well , you still smell good
and soon you" re gonna be
dead meat
you" re dead meat
dead meat
kind of folks you don" t wanna meet
you" re dead meat
and guess who" s on the menu
well , i hoped you liked your life
cause now it" s gone
the moon has just come up
say good bye to your last thought
the hunger here will never go away
cause the walking dead have all come out to play
soon you" il be dismembered and shared around
and your brains will empty out
on the blood soaked ground
too late for doubt , too late to even pray
you are what you eat
or so they say
into the darkened forest
where the mist is thick as blood
there lurks an evil i set free
and though it" s way past supper
well , you still smell good
and soon you" re gonna be
dead meat
you" re dead meat
kind of folks you don" t wanna meet
you" re dead meat
and guess who" s on the menu
dead meat
you" re dead meat
kind of folks you don" t wanna meet
you" re dead meat
and guess who" s on the menu
