forward march !
what is it?
they're celebrating the revolution .
it's the 4th of july .
what the devil's this?

and to getting home .

gentlemen , follow us .
about face !
company , halt !
all right , let's line up down here !
all right , grab a cup !
line it up !
here we go .
that explains what happened to the potatoes .
no harm in closing down tom for one day , roger .
i suppose it'll do us all good to let off a bit of steam .
there's only 14 feet to go , sir , and you can feel it throughout the whole camp .
i think that calls for a drink .
hear , hear .
drink it up !
what is this stuff , hilts?
moonshine .
american moonshine .
moonshine .
make my moustache grow .
cheers .
keep it moving .
hello , eric .
don't spill any of that .
there you go .
down with the british .
all right , old cobber .
keep it mo ...
don't get any on your clothes .
cheers !
don't spill any of that .
before your morning tea?
keep it moving .
don't get any on your clothes , sir .
american moonshine .
don't smoke right after you drink it .
no smoking .
no smoking while you're drinking .
get good and stoned , my friend .
keep it going .
keep it ...
no taxation without representation .
keep it going , boys .
keep it ...
keep it going , fellas .
enjoy yourselves .
well , let's drink to tom .
to tom .
in the three years , seven months and two weeks that i've been in the bag , that's the most extraordinary stuff i've ever tasted .
it's shattering .
well , i think it's rather good .
well , with your permission , sir , i think i'll all on kive .
call on ives .
cheers , hendley !
you know what that is?
i'll tell you what it isn't .
it isn't napoleon brandy .
how do you like it , sir?
well , it's ...
to the colonies .
independence .
how are you managing over there without us?
getting along all right , are you?
we seem to be getting along all right , shir ... sir .
yes , well , it's ...
it's good stuff , hilts .
thank you , sir .
danny !
here's to ...
roger , goons in 105 .
who?
strachwitz .
we have to ignore it .
if we pay attention , the goons'll know the hut's important .
here's to going home .
come on , danny .
they've searched it a hundred times .
home !
anyway , i'm glad we've got you in the tunnel with us .
to tom , eh?
och , never mind .
you'll be walking down argyle street in a couple of weeks .
to tom .
you know , sandy , i'm just beginning to realise that myself .
why shouldn't you , man?
we're nearly at the trees , boy .
we're nearly at the trees , eh?
herr hauptfeldwebel !
herr hauptfeldwebel !
oh , my god !
they've found tom .
it's the tunnel .
success .
ives !
sir , let me know the exact information you need .
i'm going out tonight .
right .
open up harry .
we dig .
around the clock .
cooler .
right .
well , i didn't think they'd catch him so soon .
he wasn't caught .
hilts , welcome home .
danny?
danny?
danny?
are you all right , danny?
yes .
all right .
all right .
bring some shovels .
i'm all right .
for god's sake , you've left out a whole eagle .
that's impossible .
yes .
four days 'work up the bloody spout !
i'm sorry , colin .
it's all right , smithy .
it's getting late .
you push off to bed .
i'll pack up here .
all right .
good night , colin .
good night , smithy .
i can't see a bloody thing .
your german's very good .
thanks , mac .
i've put in a lot of ...
watch it .
that's the easiest way to trip up a suspect .
don't fall for that old gag .
i'm sorry , mac .
ok .
but remember , german always .
one , two , three , four , five .
roger .
no , it's me .
how do you like the old escape suit?
fine , fine .
colin .
how do you like mine?
it looks splendid .
where are you going?
you'll get yourself shot .
what's the matter with you?
i'm going out through that fence .
danny , we're getting out through the tunnel .
we're almost clear .
please , willie , let me alone .
i can't go in that tunnel any more .
so i'm going out through the wire .
danny , think .
we're getting out , but not through the wire .
we're getting out through the tunnel .
it's finished .
i go out now .
no .
danny , you go through that wire and you'll get killed .
don't do that .
willie ...
since i was a boy ,
i hate and feared little rooms , closets , caves .
danny , you've dug 17 tunnels .
over 17 tunnels .
because i must get out .
i hide the fear , and i dig .
but tomorrow night in the tunnel with all those men ,
i'm afraid maybe this time i will lose my head and ruin the escape for everybody .
so i go now .
danny , i'll see you through the tunnel .
i'll look after you .
i'll stick with you all the way .
all right .
good evening .
hello , roger .
well , how do you think we look?
it's as bad as all that?
colin , i want first of all to say that without you , we would not have been ready .
that's all right .
i had lots of help .
lots of very good help .
what's the matter , roger?
you can't go .
what do you mean?
i can't allow it .
why?
you can't see your hand in front of your face .
you'd be caught before you got 10 yards .
that's ridiculous .
that's ridiculous .
never heard anything so absurd in my life .
i can see perfectly .
i can see perfectly !
i can see ... that pin down there .
does that satisfy you?
what pin?
where?
colin , do you see the foot of the door?
yes , of course .
put the pin down there , will you?
all right .
all right .
come on .
come on .
sit down .
sit down .
it was a good try .
i hate these last minute letdowns , but i've only just been told .
it's too risky for you .
don't you think that's colin's decision?
no , i don't .
come on , roger .
we all know the score here .
well , at least , most of us do .
your idea of this escape is to start another front , to foul up the germans behind the lines .
all right , that's fine .
but once we get past that wire and have them looking all over germany for us , that mission is accomplished .
afterwards , we have some ideas of our own .
you mean getting home?
back to your family?
that's right .
do you really believe i haven't thought about that too?
i'm sure you have .
i know colin has .
and , roger , i have too .
we think we can make it all the way .
not colin .
he'd be an appalling hazard to the escape .
that must be my decision .
let's talk about hazard .
let's talk about you .
you're the biggest hazard we have .
the gestapo has you marked .
no one has said you can't go .
that's true .
i have thought about the gestapo .
but if you're asking me how far a commanding officer is allowed to go , or dare go , or should be permitted to play god ,
i can't answer you .
but i can tell you a blind man is an unnecessary hazard to himself and the whole plan , and must therefore be eliminated from the operation .
colin's not a blind man as long as he's with me , and he's going with me .
it's all right with you , colin?
oh , yes .
quite .
very well .
i'll arrange for your escape numbers to be altered accordingly .
good night , gentlemen .
actually ... he's quite right .
he's completely right .
i really shouldn't go at all .
my eyes have been getting worse and worse lately .
i think they call it progressive myopia .
i can see things up here .
close to .
i can see to work , but ... you're just a blur .
i know .
oh , hell .
we'll make it in great shape .
colin , do you have any tea?
yes , of course .
then let's have some .
splendid .
hi , hilts .
hey , mac .
when?
tonight .
we thought they'd never let you out .
me , too .
let's get at it .
bartlett's waiting for you .
i'll be there .
what time?
only eight minutes now , danny .
you ok?
cavendish .
griff , down there .
goff , there .
smith , foles , third on the right .
blythe , hendley , third on the left .
there are the lights .
right on the tick , danny .
look down the tunnel , danny .
it's lovely .
it's just like blackpool at the height of the season .
you ever been to blackpool , danny?
yes .
no .
i don't know .
it's time , roger .
bartlett , macdonald , ashley pitt .
it's all clear , sir .
all set , roger .
roger .
good luck .
they're coming down the shaft now , danny .
and then they'll be coming right up the tunnel .
willie ...
i can't wait .
i must get out .
danny !
danny !
danny !
danny !
what is it , danny?
what's the matter?
danny !
come here !
roger?
danny and i'll go later .
we'll take another place .
danny , tell me what this is and tell me quickly !
this tunnel is mine as much as anybody .
i dug it .
i built it .
i was buried many times .
i go when i want .
let me out .
let me out .
take him out , willie .
take him out .
danny?
what is it?
danny , what's going on?
it's all right , sedgwick .
it's all right .
we're going later .
danny , it's all right .
it's all right .
we can take another place in the line .
it's all right .
all right , colin .
down you go .
sit down .
feel the top rung of the ladder with your right foot .
got it?
down you go .
danny cut out , huh?
willie took him up top .
hilts , i ...
remember , keep your head down .
right .
right .
bartlett .
all right?
hold on to yourself .
you're 20 feet short .
what do you mean?
20 feet short of the woods .
the hole is in the open .
the guard is between us and the lights .
how could that happen?
what the hell difference does it make?
it's happened .
roger ...
damn it , mac !
i'm trying to think !
we could postpone it .
all the documents are dated today .
it's now or never .
one chance .
when the guard goes to the far end , you might be able to move out .
i think i can make it to the woods , set up a signal when you're clear .
what about the towers?
they're gonna be watching the compound , not the woods .
mac , pass the word .
send down 30 feet of rope .
send down 30 feet of rope !
send down 30 feet of rope .
send down 30 feet of rope !
what?
30 feet of rope !
what do they want that for?
how should i know?
get the rope .
how's it going?
have you heard?
some kind of foul up , i think , sir .
haven't they moved into the tunnel yet?
i don't think so , sir .
he's over there .
right .
you go first , eric .
i'm staying here till we get moving .
see you in piccadilly .
scott's bar .
right .
thank you .
good luck .
right .
we're moving .
danny , they're moving through the tunnel now .
they're getting out .
when warsaw fell , you escaped and came to england because you're a flier .
you came because you wanted to fly with us and fight the germans .
we can get out now .
we can get back to england .
if you don't go through that tunnel , everything you've done will have been for nothing nothing !
blythe's behind , mac .
right .
in here , colin .
sit down .
you're up , sedgwick .
i'll take over .
what have you got in here?
a piano?
that's very funny , mate .
you won't get this thing through .
i'll cope .
was that sedgwick with his trunk?
who else?
i wish he was home with his kangaroos .
we're 20 feet short .
how the hell ...?
hilts is on the other end of that rope in the woods .
as soon as you feel a couple of tugs , off you go , but keep colin low .
good luck , colin .
thanks , mac .
what's that?
it's an air raid .
oh , god !
no !
the goons'll pull the switches .
we'll lose the lights in the tunnel .
come on , colin .
we can get out when the lights go down .
willie .
willie !
it's an air raid .
searchlights are out .
come on !
get 'em out .
it's gonna give !
danny .
danny .
danny , it's all right .
danny , it's the lights .
light the lamps down there !
there's been an air raid and they've cut the lights .
danny , it's all right .
listen to me !
danny , look .
come on , fellas .
move !
move !
we can get dozens out in this darkness .
what the hell's going on?
you go .
no .
danny .
go .
what is this , willie?
danny .
is he stuck in there?
he's all right .
get him out fast .
come on .
come on , danny , move .
up you go .
give me your bag .
we're on the rope !
you and i had better get out , or we won't have a chance of any of the trains .
it's moving .
we'll just have to pass the instructions from man to man .
right .
i'll be right behind you .
come on , come on .
come on .
hey !
don't shoot !
don't shoot !
don't shoot !
get off !
we're coming back !
oh , boy .
there's a hell of a lot of shooting going on up there .
think they've been shooting them as they came out?
we would've heard the shots before .
pull !
wait for me .
out .
out .
how many did he say?
76 .
76 .
76 .
76 .
dismissed .
ten hut !
half the guys who missed their trains are piled up here .
ashley pitt , roger , macdonald , nimmo .
makes quite a group .
what do we do?
wait for the train .
tallyho .
tallyho .
are the police on the train?
the gestapo are with them .
let's jump .
all right .
i'll tell you when .
i'd prefer you just to give me a firm push .
are you all right?
yes , i'm fine .
that's quite exciting .
it isn't stopping .
no , we're all right .
switzerland .
hey !
bartlett .
where were you going , cavendish?
i ...
i hadn't quite decided .
what information were you to collect on the way?
none .
what sabotage directions did you receive?
what have you done with your papers?
papers?
forged papers and identity cards .
don't be so stupid .
what did you do with them?
all i did was escape from a prison camp .
you'd do the same if you'd been locked up for three years .
i wanted to get home .
i don't think you'll see your wife again .
you've got the wrong man .
i'm not even married .
you're wearing civilian clothes .
you're a spy .
spies are being shot .
this is my uniform .
i had to recut it when i lost weight .
i dyed it with boot polish to cover some oil smears
i picked up when i was shot down .
and you lost your insignia over the years?
that's right .
look ...
that's all , cavendish .
hello , boys .
hello .
hello , haynes .
hello , cavendish .
i wish i could say i was happy to see you again .
just picked up?
yes , this morning .
there's a trainer out there i can fly .
any sentries?
yeah , it's gonna be a problem .
colin , when i say go , crank this clockwise .
when the engine catches , don't move , or you'll get a mouth full of propeller .
go !
next stop , switzerland !
the alps .
splendid .
over this range , then 20 more minutes and we've got it made .
what is it?
petrol?
i don't know .
we're losing power .
go that way !
i'll follow .
hendley?
colin !
stop !
don't shoot !
please !
colin , i'm sorry i fouled things up .
that's all right .
thank you for ... getting me out .
caf suzette .
hello?
hello?
resistance .
resistance?
you are english?
i'm australian .
you can speak english .
i understand .
bloody good .
i'm a british officer .
i've just escaped from a prisoner of war camp in germany .
i'm trying to make my way into spain .
you understand me?
can you help me?
i know someone who can .
bloody good .
good luck .
thank you .
you are english .
herr bartlett?
your german is good .
and i hear also your french .
your arms ... up !
herr bartlett .
and herr macdonald .
we are together again .
you are going to wish you had never put us to so much trouble .
what's troubling you , roger?
i'm just a little surprised .
i expected either a long stay or a very short trip .
yes .
i have to admit , i'm a little worried , though .
i hope to god i haven't blotted 70 odd ledgers .
och , no , no .
we're all over 21 , footloose and fancy free .
we'd never have got as far as we did without you , roger .
for what it's worth , i think you did a damn good job .
i think we all do .
yes .
all right .
you can get out now .
stretch your legs for five minutes .
it will take hours before you reach the camp .
you know , mac , all this the organisation , tunnelling , tom and harry kept me alive .
and even though we ...
i've never been happier .
you know , mac ...
1 1 of your men are being returned today .
oh , who?
i do not have that information .
i ...
i am directed by a higher authority to inform you that ...
50 of your officers were shot while escaping .
shot?
their ... personal effects will be returned .
how many of them were wounded?
here are the names ... of the dead .
how many of the 50 were wounded?
none .
they the higher authority only directs me to inform you that ... that 50 men were ...
i see .
addison , john .
alladale , peter .
bancroft , edward .
bartlett , roger .
cavendish , dennis .
eldridge , david .
felton , william .
fanshaw , arthur .
i am your guide , se? or .
spain?
glad to see you're all safe .
thank you , sir .
how many have been brought back?
you're the first .
do you know how many got away?
not yet .
what happened to blythe?
he didn't make it , sir .
roger was right about that .
i'm afraid roger didn't make it , either .
i've just posted the list .
they shot ... 50 .
the gestapo murdered them .
50?
macdonald , ashley pitt?
yes .
danny and willie?
no , they're not on the list .
haynes?
yes .
i'm sorry .
roger's idea was to get back at the enemy the hardest way he could .
mess up the works .
from what we've heard here , i think he did exactly that .
do you think it was worth the price?
that depends on your point of view , hendley .
yes , sir .
he is not to be saluted .
he's no longer in command .
the job just didn't work out , huh?
you were lucky , hilts .
lucky?
because i didn't ...
how many?
50 .
it looks , after all , as if you will see berlin before i do .
sir .
hey , hilts !
