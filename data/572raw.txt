<i>one way or another . </ i>
ladies and gentlemen , justice is blind ... ... but it can be heard .
and today , the truth will come out .
mr. quesada , would you state for the court ... ... the sequence of events leading up to the night of june 30?
i stopped off at josie's bar after work .
i had a few drinks .
angela was there .
she was closing up .
she asked me if i wanted to stick around for some fun .
anything that happened after that was entirely consensual .
are you aware that perjury is a crime , mr. quesada?
objection .
my client's a respectable member of the community .
miss sutton has a history of drug ...
my client's not on trial .
her testimony is suspect ...
nor is her testimony suspect .
gentlemen , that's enough .
the truth is , mr. murdock , is that miss sutton ...
miss sutton enjoyed every minute of it .
mr. quesada , for your sake , i hope justice is found here today ... ... before justice finds you .
that's not right .
another rapist back on the streets .
yeah?
here's what i don't get .
how can a scumbag like quesada afford an attorney like hirsh?
he can't .
the kingpin's gotta be footing the bill .
come on .
let's go get drunk .
not tonight .
i got work to do .
right here .
hey .
what's up?
you gotta take that .
big neck , come on .
i can't believe ...
what was her name?
to the justice system , right?
of course i beat it .
kingpin's got my back , bro .
how you doing , sweetie?
boss?
what's up?
what's up with that?
is that guy for real?
yeah , he's for real .
what do you want?
justice .
oh , god .
oh , god !
hi .
how you doing?
didn't you hear?
i was acquitted .
not by me .
hey , that light at the end of the tunnel?
guess what .
that's not heaven .
i'll kill you !
i'll kill you !
that's the c train .
i'll kill you !
oh , god !
hey , you can't go past there .
call charlie .
right .
you're wasting your time , urich .
there's nothing to see here .
jose quesada .
and the rest of jose quesada .
whole lot of nothing , huh?
keep running those stories ... ... and we'll end up with copycat vigilantes who'll get themselves killed .
are you here to confirm that daredevil is responsible for this , detective?
come on , urich .
stop busting my ...
there is no proof that your so called daredevil was involved ... ... nor that he even exists .
got it?
got it .
<i>can one man make a difference? </ i>

forgive me , father , for i have sinned .
it's been a week since ...
what are you playing at , matt?
you didn't come here for forgiveness .
you want permission , and i can't give you that .
justice isn't a sin , father .
no , but vengeance is .
you see it every day on the streets .
violence just begets more violence .
is that how you want to live your life?
a lawyer during the day ... ... and then judge and jury at night .
is that what you want?
somebody has to do something .
well , why you?
because i can .
because i'm not afraid .
well , i'm afraid for you , matthew .
look , a man without fear is a man without hope .
may god have mercy on you , forgive you and grant you everlasting life .
amen .
i'm not too crazy about the outfit either .
eyewitnesses say quesada was singled out ... ... by the demonic vigilante known as the daredevil .
i don't know why you read that .
there's gotta be something to it .
like the alligators in the sewers?
there are alligators in the sewers .
a friend in sanitation has seen them .
fine .
just drop it .
you should see this guy .
they got this picture .
they have a picture?
it's a drawing , an artist's rendering .
it's just ...
it's grotesque .
i'd hate to see his therapy bills .
speaking of bills ... ... your client , mr. lee , made his first payment .
great .
you should be very happy .
yeah , it's fantastic .
he paid in fluke .
fluke is a fish .
did you know that?
i didn't .
mr. lee is a good man and doesn't have much money ... ... and he fishes on weekends .
i guess it's ...
i salsa dance on weekends , but i don't shake my ass to pay my phone bill .
will you pass the honey , please?
we need better clients .
i'm tired of pro bono cases .
what is your problem with our clients?
we have good , honorable clients .
what's your idea of better?
define " better .
what would be a better client?
better means rich and guilty , okay?
law school taught us to create a moral vacuum ... ... so you can represent people who aren't innocent .
that was your best course , as i recall .
you don't have a moral vacuum .
you are completely vacuum less .
what?
what?
where?
where?
where?
front door .
not yet , soon .
now .
tell me .
you want the truth?
absolutely .
she's hideous .
i don't know if it's a fungus or some congenital birth defect ... ... but as your attorney in this matter , i advise you to take no further action .
i'm sorry .
excuse me .
sure .
i was looking for some honey .
could you help me out?
right in front of you .
well , could you be a little bit more specific?
what are you ...?
blind?
yeah .
i am so sorry .
that's okay .
friend of yours?
you know , i've never seen him before .
matt murdock .
nice to meet you , matt murdock .
nice to meet you .
i didn't get your name .
i didn't give it .
some people have no compassion for the handicapped .
apparently not .
where you going?
i'm gonna file an appeal .
we have to be in court by noon .
12 : 00 , matt .
i'll be there .
what do you want?
i just wanted to get your name .
i didn't want trouble .
look ... ... i don't like being followed .
so don't .
wait a minute .
wait a minute .
wait a second .
take it easy .
i don't like being touched .
why don't you tell me what you do like , and we'll start there .
sure you're blind?
sure you don't wanna tell me your name?
you're holding back .
yes .
don't .
does every guy have to go through this to find out your name?
try asking for my number .
fight !
fight !
fight !
fight !
stop hitting me .
okay .
my name's elektra natchios .
what's wrong , wesley?
have you seen the papers today?
somebody's been talking .
somebody always does .
natchios , my dear , old friend .
i'm getting out , wilson .
i am out .
you think it's funny?
they're writing about the kingpin .
they're going back to the beginning .
well , i'm tired of looking over my shoulder .
i want to put that behind me .
i want you to buy me out .
i think you'll find it's a very generous offer .
so , what do you say?
how's your daughter?
you okay?
i ...
i think i'll be okay .
i'm not gonna lie and say it doesn't hurt .
where did you learn to fight like that?
my father .
he had me study with a different sensei every year since i was 5 .
sounds like he wanted to turn you into some kind of a warrior .
no .
just not a victim .
watch your step .
thank you .
i didn't even ...
wait .
how did you do that?
how did you do the park?
i don't know , growing up in the kitchen , a blind kid .
you learn how to look out for yourself .
see that?
he just ran that light .
i want you to create a paper trail , one that can be traced to natchios .
sir?
the press want a kingpin .
so i'll give them a kingpin .
get me bullseye .
two out of three .
bloody irish piece of trash .
i said i was sorry .
what do you want?
details .
you owe me that .
her name's elektra natchios .
she sounds like a mexican appetizer .
it's greek , genius .
her father's nikolaos natchios .
the billionaire?
yeah , see .
yes , the billionaire .
as your attorney , i advise you to marry her immediately .
i'll take it under consideration .
susie is my son larry's daughter by his first marriage .
she eloped with this semi colored fellow from london .
what's the word for that?
mulatto .
just let's say he had a little cream in his coffee .
but he did very well for himself on the internet .
but don't ask me how .
no .
you know , they did get me a computer for christmas last year ... ... but i refuse .
i'm afraid it's going to explode .
but who can afford to fly these days?
but then my sister marjorie called and said she had these frequent flier miles ... ... and she couldn't use them because of her sciatic nerve .
so i said ...
she's sleeping .
can i get you anything before we land?
more peanuts , please .
yo , taxi !
that's over on seventh .
you don't remember me?
thanks , buddy .
how can you not remember the kingpin?
no , no , no , no .
please !
no , please , no !
you remember me now?
what are you , stupid?
you think you could hold out on the kingpin?
huh?
get away from me !
stay out of hell's kitchen .
this ain't your neighborhood no more .
kitchen belongs to the kingpin now .
please .
please don't hurt me .
i'm not the bad guy , kid .
i'm not the bad guy .
i'm not .
i have to call you back because he just came in .
morning .
your ears must have been burning .
why?
this just came by messenger .
your invitation to the black & white ball at the grand .
plus one .
plus one?
all right .
guess i gotta rent a tux .
wow .
they spent some serious money on this invitation .
i mean , you should feel it .
it's engraved .
what time are you gonna pick me up?
i'm not going .
what?
are you crazy?
that place is gonna be crawling with rich people .
people who pay legal fees with money , not with fish .
or with wheels of cheese .
or with sports supplies .
i'm gonna fill you in on a secret .
this place doesn't look like a law office .
it looks like the set of <i>sanford and son</ i> .
i'm waiting for lamont to walk in .
then you go .
look at me , matt .
i'm a plus one .
plus ones don't get anywhere alone .
they need somebody to bring them .
are you finished?
we only have an hour to prepare for court .
what's eating you?
rough night .
well , you want to talk about it?
no .
it's about elektra , isn't it?
no .
natchios owns the grand hotel , and elektra's the reason you were invited .
she's out of my league , and i'd rather end it before it starts .
that's gotta be some record .
you just completely bypass the relationship ... ... you went right into the breakup .
trying to save some time?
what happens to that lie detector of yours when it detects your own bull?
let's really bury the needle , huh?
swish .
look , matt , seriously , the ball's in your court .
so does this mean you want a rematch?
i knew i'd find you .
how did you know i wasn't a mugger?
muggers don't usually wear rose oil or high heels .
at least this far from chelsea .
come here .
there's something i wanna show you .
wait a second .
exactly how many women have you brought up here , anyway?
you're my first .
good answer .
i thought that was the right answer .
look at this .
it's so beautiful .
i know .
this was my favorite view of the city when i was a kid .
i really wanted you to see this .
what's this?
that's from my mother .
for good luck .
it's beautiful .
it's a good luck charm , huh?
i could use one of those .
do they make them in braille?
she gave it to me right before she died .
what happened?
i should go .
no .
just wait .
no , i'm gonna go ...
wait , wait , wait .
it's about to rain .
no , it's not .
it is .
i'm telling you , it's ...
the temperature dropped two or three degrees .
i can smell the moisture .
and when it rains , it's like there's a rooftop on the world .
each raindrop makes a sound the first time it falls on a surface .
just then , it's like i ...
it's like i can see again .
and i just wanna ...
i just wanna see you .
okay .
look , here it comes .
my god .
you are so beautiful .
hey , i'm gonna cut you up , man .
think kingpin didn't want his money?
what?
that's my car !
that's my car !
matt , what's wrong?
police !
shut up !
matt?
i'm sorry .
i have to go .
hey , come back here .
stay .
stay with me .
this is what i'm talking about .
aren't you happy you listened to me?
this is gonna be great for business .
thank you .
matt murdock .
ben urich , <i>new york post</ i> .
ben urich , nice to meet you .
you write articles about urban legends , right?
well , yes , among other things .
settle something for us .
you know the alligators in the sewers?
my partner ...
i followed that piece you wrote about the kingpin .
one man running all the crime in new york city sounds a little far fetched .
yeah , but , then again , so does a vigilante who thinks every day is halloween .
they gotta be huge by now , right , the alligators?
it's a myth .
look , i'd like you to give me a call ...
sorry .
cool color .
i wouldn't know .
yeah , but do give me a call .
there's something i'd like to talk to you about .
nice to meet you .
enjoy the party .
look at that .
wilson fisk is in the hizzey .
we may never get a chance like this again .
come on , let's go .
we should talk about this .
mr. fisk .
hi .
it's franklin nelson from nelson & murdock ...
hey , yeah , you wanna talk to mr. fisk , you make an appointment .
okay?
wesley .
i know who you are .
you're the blind lawyers from hell's kitchen .
right .
actually , he's the blind one .
i'm deaf .
give them a card , wesley .
i'm always on the lookout for new blood .
i'm sorry , mr. fisk .
my partner is a little overzealous .
we can't represent you .
and why is that?
yes , why is that , mr. murdock?
because we only handle clients who are innocent .
innocent , " he said .
he's pretty funny .
i've learned one thing in my years in this business .
what's that?
nobody's innocent .
nobody .
have a great time at the party .
thank you .
i just ...
you know , matt , for one night , i just wish ...
i just ...
matt , i just wish i could give you my eyes for one night .
it's like that?
it's like that .
you want me to take you up there , matt?
matt?
matt?
now i found you .
that's all that matters .
hi .
hello .
hello .
hello .
you look beautiful tonight .
do you mind?
no , i just ...
sometimes it makes people uncomfortable .
that's all .
not me .
but you should know ... ... that the only reason i got dressed up for this thing ... ... was that i wanted to look beautiful for you .
i wish you could see me tonight .
me too .
matt .
what's wrong?
it's just ... ... good things don't happen to me very often .
when they do , i get scared .
nothing bad is gonna happen .
promise .
doesn't she look beautiful?
i think she's happy .
i haven't seen her smile like that since before her mother was killed .
poor girl .
right in front of her eyes .
what , you have to bring that up now?
history has a way of repeating itself .
what are you saying?
just saying goodbye , old friend .
just saying goodbye .
something's happening .
what is it?
papa !
papa .
papa .
tell me where you're going .
you wait .
i'm sorry .
what is going on?
new york is not a safe place tonight .
that's all you need to know .
watch out !
i missed .
i never miss .
drop something?
bullseye .
daddy .
get that over to forensics right away .
hey , nick .
what do you want , urich?
does all this make you happy?
looks like you got your story .
you were right , father .
you were right .
i know how you feel .
you don't know how i feel .
i want revenge .
revenge won't make the pain go away .

how did you get past my security?
you mean that guy?

necessary?
no , it was fun .

you even managed to implicate daredevil in the process .
you should be pleased .

is there anything else?
yeah .
i want a bloody costume .

matt , it's ben urich .

i think natchios was set up by the real kingpin .
why are you telling me this?
they say the kingpin doesn't just kill you .
he kills your whole family .
i think your girl's in trouble .
i thought you might know somebody that could protect her .
remember me?
wait !
it wasn't me .
stop !
it was a hit man named bullseye .

daredevil .
kingpin .
it's a shame you came here wounded .
i would have loved to fight you in your prime .
they call you the man without fear .

i don't believe it .
no .

the blind lawyer from hell's kitchen?
you killed the only two people i ever loved .
why?
business .
that's all it ever is , business .
i was working for fallon at the time .
your father was supposed to throw a fight ... ... and your girl was in the wrong family at the wrong time .
it's always business .
<i>i'll find you . </ i>

i've been thinking about this day since i was 12 years old .
i don't understand .
i'm not the bad guy .

tell the guys at riker's all about how you got beat by a blind man .
it'll be like blood in the water .

and i'll be waiting .
justice is served .
i'll get you .

though there were no witnesses , police think daredevil brought fisk to justice .
there were no eyewitnesses .

if there's no eyewitnesses ...
bigfoot has eyewitnesses .
