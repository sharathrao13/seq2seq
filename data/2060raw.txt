maybe he was just shy .

i saw the cutest panties there .
i saw the cutest panties in h& m.
let's go there .

it's quiet in there .
i got a bit of a cut .

jocke , you want a swig?
i'm good .
it warms your entire body .
ray will spend the night here .
ray will spend the night here .
who nicked my armani shirt?
i don't know .
you don't think i can smell the glue?
sara , you'd better not be sniffing it .
i told you to quit doing that .
it fries you brain .
i haven't been sniffing any .
it was kenat up by the drugstore .
he made petra either sniff some glue or take a shot of horsch .
you mean " horse " .
yeah , horse .
the next time he bothers you , just tell him i'll cut his throat .
i can take care of myself .
yes , i can see that .
but the next time you touch my shirts . . .
you have so many .
what the hell is that?
who's that lying in my bed?
why , that's tiipa , our neighbour .
poor thing has a drinking problem .
why did you put him in my bed?
tell him to go lie in a trash can where he belongs .
as if you give a shit .
you have to get up .
we're going to bed .
but we haven't finished the film .
come on , petra .
it's time to wake the hell up .
get out of here .
check out these tits .
that's silicone .
anyone can see that .
they're hard as a rock .
i wonder who gets to do these chicks?
the guys with money .
the guys who have cash .
this watch is pretty neat .
patek chillip .
no , it's called patek phillippe .
alex has one of those .
real expensive .
but he's got no class .
that goddamned drunkard .
i'd cut off his cock .
they ought to offer rewards for his kind .
then i'd volunteer .
our lord , heavenly father .
we confess that we are unfortunately but poor , miserable sinners , and that we have no good in us .
for our hearts , flesh and blood have been so corrupted that we can never free ourselves of that evil desire .
hence , dear father , we ask you to forgive us our sins .
jocke , you're late for class .
it's a live show?
did i miss much?
no , he's just getting fired up .
yes , that was palm sunday in the swedish hymn book .
does anyone know a hymn by heart?
if you won't give us a proper class , i'll tell the headmaster .
shut up , you nerd .
let's just take it easy now .
banana jan , can't you strip for us like you did at the school party?
oh , okay .
then i opened my eyes , and there he stood .
long blond hair and pretty eyes .
has my prince finally arrived?
hey , sis .
what the hell are you doing?
i opened my eyes and gazed into his , and i was lost in the wonderful land of love .
what the hell is this?
'hi there , my name is jocke . " '
is he a fag or what?
never mind .
he's in your school .
so it's that bastard?
if i ever see you together with that son of a bitch ,
i'll kick his nasty , little rat dick up his fucking conk .
he'd kick your arse .
what are you talking about?
you're sick .
is magne in?
why?
remember what i told you about that brat .
saucy sister .
what?
i didn't mean to . . .
you didn't mean to what?
go ahead and fuck her .
better you than that bastard jocke .
are these friends of yours?
what's going on?
your daughter is becoming a harlot .
what in god's name are you doing?
what in god's name are you doing?
didn't you see the red light?
are you the deputy headmaster?
i'm the father of gusten eriksson .
i simply demand that joakim vans and ray lopez will be expelled .
i want them out of my son's class .
at this school we have a certain moral standard .
listen : burglary and vandalism .
three instances of assault .
another burglary .
multiple larcenies .
threats against an official .
this is confidential information from the social authorities .
where did you get it?
never mind that .
but i have quite a few contacts .
this other kid doesn't even have a guardian .
he has the authorities .
i find it reprehensible that such a bunch of layabouts are allowed to mingle with conscientious youngsters .
what about your own son?
he smokes pot .
well , i'll be damned .
are you blaming my son now?
you force him to mix with this kind of dregs .
if i were you , i'd be very careful with documents such as these .
the official secrets act is no joke .
i will shun no means to get you .
what do you mean by that?
i happen to know that you have quite a few skeletons in the cupboard that you may not want to appear on public display .
we fully agree .
i'll fetch the boys , and then we'll go see the headmaster .
what the hell are you doing , man?
why , he's not a man , he's a faggot .
shut up , you brats .
jocke , gurra , andy and ray will go to the headmaster .
now .
you're in real deep shit now .
i have some pot on me .
hand it to me .
what's going on?
i'll leave this in my locker .
what have you got there?
let me see .
take it easy .
can i see what you've got in your bag?
do you live in your locker?
you want to move in , you damn paki?
come along now .
jocke , honey .
what the hell are you doing here?
she's boozed up .
that's none of your business .
just kidding .
i wish i were drunk .
i can't find my way around here .
give your mum a hug now .
stop it , mum .
stop being so disgusting .
stop it .
you stink !
i've summoned you to this meeting because of a police report concerning a brawl that took place on a subway station downtown .
i found it appropriate to summon the students in question along with their parents to discuss their behaviour .
what a load of crap .
they should be in reform school .
gustav , sit down .
look at him .
my son tells me that these delinquents force him to do . . .
. . . all sorts of devilry !
this school is way too lenient .
yes , but the purpose of this meeting was to discuss the matter .
a damned meeting isn't enough .
action is what counts .
you either expel those punks , or i will make use of my contacts .
and then , by god . . .
take it easy .
shut up , you son of a bitch .
why do you call my son that?
pipe down , you moaner .
go home and wear a dress .
let's not get carried away .
what do you know about that?
this is no school .
it's an institution for the education of delinquents and punks .
the important thing is to listen to each other .
if we don't , how can we solve our conflicts?
i demand action .
i've listened enough to you two .
in situations like this people have to listen to each other .
that's the basic premise for solving conflicts .
drop them .
is it exciting?
are they worth shagging?
look at that .
is anything happening?
that wasn't much of a party .
this is damn good pot .
i bought some for the party tonight .
what party?
there's a huge party tonight .
i'm going .
this stuff isn't bad at all .
where did you get it?
the coolest guy .
he's my contact .
he told me about a clothes warehouse we can plunder .
they have no alarm system .
i'm off .
it's too smoky in here .
say " hi " to your mum .
what kind of clothes is it?
it's the greatest .
it's some sports clothes wholesaler .
he's got nike and champion .
is it somewhere in town?
there are more coming .
what's he doing in here?
i didn't know he fancied chicks .
is it a homo show?
what the hell?
what a couple of jerks .
poofters .
that's nasty .
hold on .
what is it?
quiet .
you're so gross .
get him out .
what a stinker .
hold on .
i need to take a piss .
christ , you're so gross .
come on .
hi there .
you fucking bastard !
god damn it .
take it easy .
do we just kill each other and leave?
come on .
nice , andy .
i like the way you parry with your nose .
seriously , take it easy .
are you okay?
sure .
i'll go take a shower .
remember when i ko'd tyson?
gurra enters .
the audience is expectant .
tyson has never been this scared .
and i move forward and smack . . .
your money , swedish pig .
give it up or i'll fuck you .
and your mum .
you got lucky .
the next time i'll cut your throat .
hi .
hi .
always with your left hand !
you got that , boy?
is that brunette coming?
are you horny?
what brunette?
the one with the nice rack .
where's andy?
at home changing his diaper .
yes !
i'd love to smash that fuck .
no , stay away from them .
it's good they're here .
the nazis are coming .
we don't need their help .
it's a shame andy isn't here .
i heard he was on his way .
the rescue " .
so , where do you live now?
skip it , you sodding poofter .
mike , look at that .
get him !
look at that .
your prince has arrived .
she's just waiting for you to hook up with her .
you have no sense of humour .
you think you're eddie murchy?
his name is eddie murphy .
i know that .
i won't see you again .
hi .
how are you doing?
i'm fine .
it's real good to see you .
you too .
would you like to dance?
i haven't got the time .
besides , this is a shitty dance floor .
did you see the jacuzzi upstairs?
no .
you have to go see it .
it's so cool .
she can wait here .
come on .
there's no jacuzzi in here .
no , there isn't .
well , what do you know?
just a small , dirty couch .
come on over and sit down .
come on .
thank you .
for that thing in the subway?
that was nothing .
those damned skinheads .
they got a thrashing .
you were so brave .
you were .
things like that happen .
the main thing is that we're unscathed .
we really were lucky .
it could have been us down there .
i wonder what happened to the guy that was hit?
disgusting .
yes .
we'll catch him downstairs .
you're just lying here having it off .
you think you'll get any tonight , you sad git?
jesus , what an attitude .
she's always like that .
to hell with her .
did you push ola onto the tracks?
louder !
i can't hear you !
sic him !
i didn't do it !
louder !
i'm sorry .
that's not what i meant .
i trust you .
you got that?
yet another gang killing downtown .
the victim , andreas johansson , was 17 years old , and he is believed to have taken part in a gang clash saturday night .
his body was found on a busy street in downtown stockholm .
the investigation has been stopped due to a lack of resources .
what a load of crap .
what kind of dickhead comes up with this?
he wasn't in any bloody gang .
i can't believe it .
jocke , the deputy headmaster has fondled petra .
it was so disgusting .
he forced me into a broom cupboard .
hi there .
petra , come on and let's sort this out .
no .
sort what out?
this is beyond you .
what's that supposed to mean?
i've waited for this a long time .
now you're in serious trouble .
nice car .
the coast is clear .
it's just cardboard .
this isn't what he promised us .
women's clothes .
what the hell are you doing?
take it easy .
cuff them .
take it easy !
let's go before the cops get here .
let's get out of here .
we'll do something else instead .
you haven't got much to show .
come and have a look .
