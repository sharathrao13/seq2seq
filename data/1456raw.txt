should we say it one last time?
one cannot live fully without embracing suicide and crime .
say it .
a pact made with relentless fire that requires that some live . . . . . . others die .
on three .
one . . .
. . . two . . .
. . . three !
each of us has within us a weak aspect . . . . . . eager to give up freedom to be dominated .
but we also have a will that desires freedom , that insists . . . . . . on deciding for ourselves , each of us individually . . . . . . what is good . . . . . . and what is evil .
are there any questions?
doesn't anyone want to challenge justin's thesis?
do you all submit to this darwinian struggle of egos?
i got a question .
mr. haywood , you're awake !
let's hear it .
what's a dork like you know about power?
what would an ass like you know about philosophy?
keep it civil .
are you talking about crime?
you should wake up more often .
what about it?
all freedom risks crime .
freedom is crime .
it thinks of itself and not of the group .
thank you , justin .
very daring .
thank you .
for those of you interested in the source of his report . . . . . . take a look at nietzsche .
you really need to get laid , bonaparte .
hey , justin .
remember me?
what do you want?
i want to blow your brains out .
and i'll make it look like a suicide .
everyone would believe that you killed yourself .
you won't get away with it .
your shoe prints are unique .
they'd be traced back to you .
the fibers on your shirt are all over me .
your hair too .
it's called transference .
more importantly , your fingerprints . . .
. . . on my neck . . . . . . where you touched me .
you can't get them off skin .
you can with a magna brush . . . . . . or a fingerprint cam or an iodine gun and silver transfer sheets .
you don't have the discipline to commit a murder .
is that right?
let's see .
bang !
you're dead .
what took you so long?
i've been waiting .
no , i have something better .
what is it?
absinthe .
wormwood infused alcohol .
the molecular structure is almost identical to tetrahedral chlorine .
tetra what?
the active ingredient in marijuana .
where did you get it?
poets drank it for inspiration .
it's been illegal since the turn of the century .
even better .
to the systematic derangement of our senses .
forget the senses .
let's derange the world .
we will .
when?
soon .
what about tonight?
what about right now?
i have a biology ...
fuck your biology !
you always have excuses .
let's forget it .
we've been planning this for months .
i'm sick of planning .
that's all it is with you .
it's talk and plans and dreams .
you're a jerk off .
so jerk off .
richard , wait .
just be patient .
here comes the hyena .
why can't i go inside the perimeter?
i told them not to let anybody in .
it's your first homicide .
i didn't want you stepping on your tongue .
take this .
what is it?
important tool .
hey , boys !
snack time !
set up a staging area .
this place will be crawling with people . . . . . . including our chief .
rod?
yeah , rod is not a cop .
darnell , get out of my crime scene !
come on !
sorry , cassie .
there's only one way into a crime scene .
put your foot where mine goes and nowhere else .
ready?
ever do this in vice?
no .
right there .
looks like some kind of boot .
what's that smell like?
smells like vomit .
that's what i thought .
bag some for the lab .
what's the matter?
nothing .
notice the hemorrhaging?
she was strangled .
finger shaped marks around the neck .
look at this .
clean cut .
trophy?
that'd be my guess .
defensive wounds .
she put up a fight .
good for you .
this is a secondary crime scene .
why?
this wound would produce lots of blood .
there's very little here .
what about these?
piquerism .
pre or postmortem?
post , no blood .
not bad , vice .
probably aced your detective's exam .
the wind is picking up , we'll lose evidence .
hold on to everything we find .
any idea who she is?
no .
no car , no i. d.
jane doe .
hey , bonaparte .
what's the matter?
miss mills?
time's up .
put your pens down .
exchange your test with a neighbor .
number 20 is c. . . . . .
burnt norton .
i suppose you find it funny .
what?
me flunking a pop quiz .
you didn't flunk .
you got 1 9 out of 20 .
please pass the tests forward .
wait up , i want to talk to you .
why did you do that?
i have motives .
like what?
i need your help for my physics midterm .
why me?
because you're a genius , okay?
i live at 1 1 08 chandler .
can you remember that?
around 5?
hi , lisa .
this friend ...
turn right .
it's right here .
a houseboat .
neat .
neat indeed .
i like it out here .
not too many people .
thanks .
see you tomorrow .
you gonna see me to the door?
of course .
you made detective in four years?
must be smarter than you look .
thank you .
it'll only get worse , i warn you .
you been talking to the boys?
i heard a few things .
they tell you why i was called the hyena?
why?
female hyenas have a mock penis .
draw your own conclusions .
does that bother you?
i just wear loose slacks .
it's really not a problem .
see you later .
no prints .
the killer must have worn gloves .
so it's not a husband or boyfriend .
why?
you don't use gloves to kill your wife .
unless you've thought about it .
missing ring finger .
ritual?
serial killer?
maybe a comment on matrimony .
a negative one .
maybe we should investigate every bad marriage in the county .
why don't you get on that?
let's start with you .
ever been married?
nope .
what's this?
an old murder case i was involved in .
the guy's up for parole , they want me to testify .
what do we have on jane doe?
i'm checking missing persons nationwide .
run her prints , have an artist do a sketch .
i got it .
bonaparte !
i didn't think you'd show .
come in .
who did these?
they're quite good .
thank you .
you did them?
don't look so surprised .
i modeled for them too .
bonaparte , you're blushing .
why do you call me that?
ever take a career aptitude test?
no .
if you ever did , they'd recommend you a career as a dictator .
why?
who would listen to me?
where's your physics book?
you're overfeeding that thing .
it'll get as fat as you are .
i hope this is better than that other stuff .
it's kgb .
for $400 , it better put me on the moon .
you'll be totally satisfied , i guarantee it .
money back?
come on , can't we cut a deal?
you don't want it?
i want it .
richie rich .
i hate it when you call me that .
it's a deal .
bring me a couple pigtailed cheerleaders . . . . . . then i give it to you free .
how can i trust that?
i love this part .
can i just get the product already?
check this out .
come on ...
you'll get it .
hang on .
listen to her .
she loves it .
we got our jane doe .
her name was olivia lake .
she missed three days of work .
her supervisor found the place like this .
what do we know about the supervisor?
married , two kids , solid alibi .
maybe she caught somebody in the middle of a 459 , and he panicked?
and what , took the body with him?
where did these mud prints come from?
there's a planting bed out here .
looks dry as a bone .
maybe she watered the lawn .
we got a time of death?
based on stomach content , between 9 and 1 0 thursday night .
how about 9 : 27?
can we come in?
let the games begin .
sam kennedy , al swanson .
new assistant d. a. and former member of our department .
nice to meet you .
miss mayweather , always a pleasure .
heard you finally passed the bar .
did they make it true or false?
she hasn't lost her sting .
what are you doing here?
staying informed .
really?
sam , please keep him informed .
thank you .
what do we got here?
sorry .
can i have you sign off?
okay .
sam , it's me .
i'll be a little late .
why don't you get started?
looks like a body dump .
jesus , she's alive !
nice detective work .
how'd you find me?
talk to the neighbors .
you said a little late , and it's been three hours .
this about that d. a. , swanson?
that asshole?
no .
he seemed okay .
yeah , well , try dating him .
he got rough with me , so i broke his nose with a cat .
a cat?
well , a ceramic cat .
no , thanks .
good .
then you can walk me home .
sure .
thank you .
sit down .
i should get going .
what's the rush?
can i ask you a personal question?
i can hardly wait .
how did you get into this work?
why homicide?
someone i knew was murdered , and i got interested .
really?
no .
i'm just bullshitting you .
it's just the kind of crap people like to hear .
wait .
what are you doing?
it's called sex .
it's fun , you should try it .
we gotta work together .
this is a bad idea .
don't worry , i won't get possessive .
wait .
why are you doing this?
because i want to .
what about what i want?
what do you want?
right now?
yeah .
this .
wait .
slow down .
no , no , leave that on .
just that .
please .
sure .
what's the matter?
you gotta get up , you gotta go .
why?
because i gotta get some sleep .
can we sleep together?
bed's too small .
no , it's not .
come on , you gotta go .
jesus !
i'll see you tomorrow .
good night .
the evidence is so tiny , you wouldn't recognize it .
a few red and yellow carpet fibers , some hair .
that's it .
the fibers will be tested to find generic and subgeneric classes . . . ... then compared to a database for the manufacturer .
fibers consistent with a mass produced variety , made in denver .
distributed in the united states under several names .
no help .
same with the red fibers .
several trilobal nylon fibers . . . . . . along with other fibers will be matched with a brand .
it's sold by hanover sampson for several discount stores .
that narrows it down .
they sold 50, 000 in that color last year .
examination of the cuticle , cortex and medulla of the hair . . . ... will reveal them to be human .
two brown human hairs .
definitely not the victim's .
all but one .
at first , it will baffle them .
one hair of nonhuman origin , scale matches cynocephalus maimon .
it's a freaking baboon hair .
no fingerprints , no murder weapon .
they have their work cut out for them .
that's what they're paid for .
coroner said strangulation was slow .
perhaps the victim was being tortured .
the postmortem stab wounds barely broke the surface .
okay , that's it .
they'll decide that , given the sloppy nature of the crime scene . . . . . . the postmortem mutilation . . . . . . the profile will be that of a disorganized offender .
poor social skills .
nocturnal by nature .
probably into pornography .
intelligent , but uneducated .
lives alone , few relations with women .
attack was spontaneous .
unplanned .
he didn't drive down close to the dump spot .
that is planning .
but he left the footprints .
no evidence will lead to the suspect , but they'll damn him .
when will they have a suspect?
they're eating out of our hands .
poor ray .
he'll never see it coming .
cassie , look at this .
vigi boots .
what the hell are vigi boots?
there he is , in the black coat .
don't let him charm you too much .
richard haywood?
cassie mayweather , sam kennedy , police .
can we talk to you?
yeah , sure .
you're willing to speak without an attorney?
sure .
where were you last thursday night?
what is this about?
answer the question .
i was cramming for this calculus midterm .
i was with a study group .
how long?
from about 7 until 3 friday morning .
that's quite a cram session .
yeah , well . . . .
i got kind of a spotty record , and i gotta keep my grades up for college .
can you give us the names of the other people there?
sure .
am i in some kind of trouble?
you seem very particular about your appearance .
thanks .
i like your outfit too .
she looks good .
it's , like , feminine . . . . . . but it still manages to be professional .
is that like a pleather?
kmart .
we're interested in your shoes .
let's talk about these .
vigis?
you own a pair of these?
you bought them at scarlatti's , downtown santa barbara , for $637 . 50 . . . . . . on your platinum bankcard .
size 1 2d .
this can't be about my shoes .
why not?
this is about my shoes?
you got me freaked out like i did something .
did you find them or what?
i reported them stolen three weeks ago .
i even filed a report with the front office .
did you find the shoes or not?
i think you should tell me what's going on .
because i'm spinning out here .
shoe prints matching these were found at a murder scene last week .
the covington woman?
that's right .
you think the person who stole my shoes committed this murder?
i'll cooperate in any way i can .
any idea who stole your boots?
no , i don't .
i wish i did now , though .
any enemies at school?
well , it's high school .
what does that mean?
not to sound arrogant , but there are people who envy me .
really?
yeah .
why would they do that?
well , let's just say that i'm very fortunate . . . . . . and that i've been blessed in many ways .
must be nice being you , richard .
i got no complaints .
it all checked out .
he filed a report about the boots .
and made a big fuss to the principal .
yeah , i bet he was a pain in the ass .
she didn't say that .
no , believe me .
i hate kids like that .
like what?
what about the study session?
six kids were at his house with him from 7 or 7 : 30 thursday evening . . . . . . till 3 a . m .
friday .
i talked to all of them .
he was there except for 1 5 minutes . . . . . . he went to an atm to get cash for a pizza .
did you check that out?
1 9 .
get that enhanced .
why?
because i can't see his face .
it's him .
i can't see his face .
you really think he's involved?
i don't know .
but something's not right with that kid .
fifteen minutes .
it doesn't give him enough time .
he has to drive to covington , kill her , dump her body , get back .
he'd need at least an hour .
they questioned me .
and?
it was so cool !
did they go for the shoes?
they grabbed it .
i was so good .
i really was .
listen .
this can 't be about my shoes .
why not?
did you find them?
you sure they didn't suspect anything?
you didn't overdo it?
a little bit .
i overdid it a little bit .
you think the person who stole my shoes committed this murder?
i want you to know i'm gonna cooperate in any way i can .
meet me at the bluff tonight .
i can't .
why not?
i have something to do .
like what?
i'll tell you later .
i should . . . .
know who his father is?
i wanna search his house .
lawrence haywood .
he built the mall .
big campaign contributor?
that's right .
and i won't fuck with that guy on this .
i've grown much too fond of my own ass to do anything that goddamned stupid !
and what is your problem?
where are you on this , sam?
i don't care who his father is .
i don't mean that .
do you think we have enough to go after him?
no .
and if we go in too soon , we could burn the whole case .
really?
and why is that , vice?
no judge would sign a warrant based on what you have .
shut up , swanson !
this kid with his attitude ...
attitude isn't a crime .
it's an indicator ...
but he doesn't fit the profile .
the profile doesn't fit !
the killer was smart .
he didn't drive to the site , he used richard's boots . . . . . . but the attack was unplanned?
but if we push too soon ...
whose case is this?
just calm down .
no , i've been trying to find olivia's killer , busting my ass ...
who's olivia?
the victim .
is this still my case?
it's a coordinated effort !
you're getting way too involved in this , cassie .
cassie !
what?
you called her by her first name .
what?
you said , " i've been trying to find olivia's killer .
no , i didn't .
did i?
you're supposed to be identifying with the killer , not the victim .
remember that?
you don 't have any witnesses or fingerprints or powder burns ...
i almost forgot .
tobias always kept a gun , right here .
loaded .
can i come in?
listen , i'm sorry i didn't back you up in there .
i'm a big girl .
you said what you thought , right?
yes , but ...
then you did the right thing .
we can't just bust in there ...
i know .
i heard you .
so can you get out of the way?
know what your problem is?
yeah , you're blocking matlock .
out of the way .
please .
i'm trying to apologize here .
all right , apology accepted .
you want to sit down?
you want to have a cookie?
hi .
hi .
what's going on?
we're making up .
we're still friends , right?
what's this?
i don't know , let's find out .
we do this and you throw me out again?
or you stay .
or you leave .
i don't know .
it's hard to tell in advance .
what do you want?
you want promises?
you want a ring?
is that what you want?
a ring?
don't !
look , it's not just about sex , okay?
i really respect you as a person .
is that what you ...?
why do you always want to hurt people?
i wouldn't say always .
it kind of happens sometimes .
you're so good at breaking other people down . . . . . . but you never stop and look at yourself .
where are you taking me?
no peeking , we're almost there .
step up .
okay .
open your eyes .
my god , justin , this is beautiful !
did you grow these?
what happened?
you're different .
yeah , i am different .
mayweather .
collect call from an inmate in a corrections facility .
the name of the inmate is ...
carl hudson .
if you wish to accept , press ...
i do not wish to accept any calls ...
cassie?
what?
it's sam .
hi , i'm sorry .
what can i do for you?
remember the puke at the body dump?
yeah .
most of it was unidentifiable . . . . . . but kevin managed to isolate some partially digested eggs .
fish eggs .
caviar?
apparently so .
i've compiled a list of the local vendors selling caviar .
what was his name?
richard haywood .
miles haywood's kid?
he came in once around christmas .
not last week?
thursday?
i rarely see any high school kids here .
except justin pendleton .
who?
he used to come with his father , but his parents split .
now he comes in alone .
he's a senior at jefferson .
richard's a senior at jefferson .
justin eats alone?
he always brings a book .
he's a bit of a loner .
but a brilliant kid , you should hear him talk .
when was he in here last?
the 5th .
7 : 30 p . m .
what time did he leave?
about 9 .
do you know what he ate?
justin?
cassie mayweather , with the san benito police .
you're a police officer?
i'm a homicide investigator .
can i ask you a couple questions?
sure .
you had dinner at maison saint croix on the 5th?
maison saint croix .
thank you .
the 5th was a thursday , and they had a caviar appetizer .
did you have it?
yeah , i might have .
can you tell me what happened?
do you know richard haywood?
everyone knows him .
is he involved in this?
is he a friend of yours?
no .
i mean , i tutored him for his bio sat last year , but we're not . . . .
we don't have much in common .
are you in his study group?
no .
what study group?
when you left the restaurant , did you take leftovers?
you didn't give your friends at the study group leftovers?
look , i told you , i barely know him .
he makes fun of me in class .
why would he do that?
because . . . . . . he's like that .
he makes fun of everyone .
he's one of the cool kids .
what makes him cool?
you know , he's smart , he's rich . . . . . . he's witty , and everyone likes him .
and you don't .
yeah , i knew kids like that .
superstars of high school .
five years from now , nobody will care who they are .
well , richard will always be cool .
his daddy's rich and i hate to admit it , but he's actually smart .
he's lazy and didn't study , but he got a 71 0 on that bio sat .
it kind of spun me out .
spinning out , huh?
you seem to know him well .
you can tell by his behavior in class .
sorry .
cassie , where have you been?
sam i. d. 'd the suspect .
who is it?
ask sam .
he's in charge of the case .
s. i. d. is over there now collecting evidence .
hi , cass .
hi .
look at this , sir .
could be a match .
log that .
i want samples of fabrics , soils , any molds , plants in here and outside .
john's found a stash of marijuana buds .
you mind if we smoke up while we work?
yes , i do .
so who is he?
raymond lee feathers .
he's a janitor at jefferson .
i compiled a list of everyone who might have stolen richard's boots .
then i cross indexed that against carpet purchases and up came this .
apparently he sold grass to the kids at school .
good work .
thank you .
where is he?
i don't know .
seems like he took off .
did you run him for priors?
a couple duls , one pot bust .
but he hasn't shown up for work since the day we talked to richard there .
did you find the boots?
not yet , but we may have a match on the yellow carpet fibers .
we've nothing on the vehicle fibers till we find his car . . . . . . but he's got a stash of porno films , mostly bondage . . . . . . just like the profile .
what?
he's not a neatness freak .
what are you saying?
sloppy enough to leave footprints , but smart enough to steal shoes in advance?
this is our guy , no question .
you find any caviar jars?
come on , wait a minute .
you're ticked that i got him , aren't you?
no .
if you got him , i'm happy for you .
after we close this case , maybe we should look for different partners .
might be better .
whatever you want .
good .
nice work , guys .
i gotta take a piss .
don't worry , i won't contaminate any evidence .
she pees standing up , that one .
al .
don't talk about her like that , please .
you've slept with her already?
what?
you will .
that's cassie's m . o .
she lets you get close , then pushes you away .
ask her what's wrong , she picks a fight .
you're working with her . . . . . . because no one else will .
looks like a body dump .
now we know where that baboon hair came from .
it's okay .
hey , lisa .
you want a ride?
we already did that .
that's not what i'm talking about .
i want to talk to you .
want me to beg?
please .
you'll get in an accident .
please .
i don't care .
you make me sad .
come on .
come on .
it's fun in here .
hello , justin .
how you doing?
what are you ...?
what are you doing here?
you stood me up for that slut?
lisa?
she's not a slut .
did you tell her anything about us?
of course not .
of course not .
you fuck her?
i was helping her with her physics .
you fucked her , and i saw you .
we kissed .
you kissed .
that was it , i swear .
oh , justin .
you helped lisa , and you didn't even get laid?
what a schmuck .
she's not like that .
bullshit .
she spreads like peanut butter .
you'd be surprised what a girl without a dad will do for male attention .
lisa .
do you hate me?
i had to do it .
i don 't want to hurt you , but i had to show you what she's really like .
she's not good enough for you .
she doesn 't appreciate you .
she's like your mom , dad and everyone else .
i'm the only person who really cares about you .
i think i'm the only person who sees how incredible you really are .
don't go away , justin .
come on .
what we did . . .
. . . together . . . . . . how many people have done that?
we proved something to each other .
we showed what we're capable of .
there's no limits for men like us .
did you hear about ray?
they're onto him .
just one last thing to do and we're home free , right?
do we have to?
you tell me .
do we have to?
richard?
is that you?
did you bring the pom poms?
i brought something to help you sleep .
what the fuck? !
my physics test .
i got a b + .
you are a genius .
don't .
i have something for you .
what is this?
you're quite the slut .
what?
what? !
how long has he been here?
nurse on the night shift said he came in about 4 .
how are you feeling?
i'm okay .
i'm a little sore , but . . . .
what are you doing here?
i figured you'd want an immediate report .
yeah , i do .
so?
we got everything .
excellent .
the boots?
that's an affirmative .
and a pair of tin snips , and a phillips head , traces of blood .
and a finger , right?
was it in a jar behind a stack of magazines . . . . . . or in the freezer under the turkey thigh?
behind the vanilla fudge ice cream .
good work .
all you need now is a confession .
there won't be one .
feathers committed suicide last night .
suicide?
yeah .
it was a gun to the head .
powder burns , gsr on his right hand .
ever heard of a ritual mutilator , an impulsive serial type killer . . . . . . committing suicide?
don't do that .
i can't think of one .
psychos want to get caught .
lie down .
i'm actually feeling a lot better , thank you .
these kids did this .
they're not even hiding it .
they want us to know .
so let's get to know them a little better .
turn around .
we got ray on this .
why did he run if he didn't do it?
there's a reason .
are you jealous because i got him . . . . . . or are you so obsessed with richard you're not thinking?
i'm sorry ...
you've been angling for this for a while , taking over the case !
they made me take it because they think you're losing it !
who thinks i'm losing it?
who?
rod?
i don't care if i'm losing it .
i'm right .
how did you come by this?
it was the weirdest thing .
i was driving by the house . . . . . . the trash can got knocked over , and the stuff fell out .
what a break .
some of this will be the mom's , some will be the boy's .
what is this?
don't ask , don't tell .
we won't know until we get the report if it matches the puke's dna .
lucky he gave us some blood with his dinner .
be sure to get a signed purchase order .
when will we know?
depends on the lab .
want me to call him?
no !
last time i had to calm him down .
just make it fast .
i'll take care of it .
see you .
what's this?
a purchase order for the dna ...
i know what it is .
this case is closed .
closed !
now , if you can't understand that , then maybe we ...
you need some time off?
nope , i'm fine .
you're not fine .
you're brilliant sometimes , but never really fine .
you want to see doc sluzer again?
no .
then no more on this case .
not another minute , not another penny .
i've about had it with you .
you hear me?
hi , it's cass .
i'll need another day or two on that purchase order .
no , just bookkeeping , changing the software , things like that .
so you'll run an analysis on that puke?
thanks , honey .
i'm sorry .
i shouldn't have done it .
come on !
you threw up?
why didn't you tell me?
i don't remember doing it .
he doesn't remember .
what if they i. d. you?
with the dna , can they do that?
i doubt it .
the stomach acids usually eat away ...
you doubt it?
i doubt it .
it could put us in the electric chair !
gas chamber .
what?
california uses a gas chamber .
that's very informative .
it doesn't matter .
no , thank you .
you told her you tutor me too?
what are you thinking?
if she found out on her own . . . . . . and i hadn't mentioned it , it would look even worse !
they have nothing .
they have nothing on me .
don't worry , i'm not a backstabber like you , richard .
how am i a back ...?
i'm not the one talking , giving away all the information . . . . . . trying to get us caught because i'm a bitch !
don't talk to me like that .
i'll talk to you how i want to .
i trust you with forensic stuff , and you have no idea what you're talking about !
you're supposed to be smart !
stop .
no , you're not smart , you're dumb !
stop !
i'm sorry .
come here .
that's a good boy .
you're not still mad about that girl , are you?
let's just stick together and stay calm until this is over , okay?
and then what?
and then what?
justin?
where are you going?
we can't be seen together .
do you think this is some kind of game?
come on , come on .
this is sam kennedy .
i'm not here to take your call ...
what are you doing here?
what are you doing here?
do you want something?
like what?
i don't know .
everybody wants something , don't they?
do they?
they just don't know how to ask for it .
what do you want?
richard , get out of the way .
you think i'm too young?
there was a killer at your school .
the whole time , somebody you were close to .
what do you mean?
raymond feathers .
you guys were friends , right?
with that degenerate?
no .
he didn't really have many friends .
he just . . . .
i don't know .
you know , even his old lady left him .
so you're friends with his old lady too?
you're a tease .
you lead guys on and then push them away .
but i think . . . . . . you like to fight .
you want it , but you need to fight about it .
no .
you don't have to do anything .
you have no choice .
you can't handle it , so you're leaving?
this is part of it !
damn it !
thank you , detective .
i bet you did this with every guy you ever dated .
tell me i'm wrong .
lf i can link richard to feathers ...
you can't stop .
i'm sorry about what i said .
i'm just a little messed up right now , but hear me out , as a friend .
just as a friend , okay?
thank you .
i saw richard and justin tonight .
they lied , they know each other .
really?
they barely have parents .
they're like orphans with credit cards .
school's too easy .
they don't have jobs or chores .
nothing's expected of them .
nothing they do matters .
so they figured , " why not kill somebody?
maybe i'm wrong , but tell rod you want to keep the case open .
what happened between you and richard tonight?
did you hit him?
in the face?
no .
no , it wasn't like that , it was ...
it was an acci ...
rod knows?
he got a call from richard's father .
he'll make you see the department shrink about this .
no .
no shrink .
it's not gonna work .
i know what i am .
i'm just not ...
okay .
so nobody wants to work with me?
that's okay .
but i'm a good cop .
and if what i say is right , and we let these kids go , and they do it again . . . .
so please just talk to rod , you're the only one he'll listen to .
i'll call him in the morning .
call him now , he's still up .
back off !
if rod says yes . . . . . . maybe you could even hang around the school and make them nervous .
we have papers due tomorrow , no excuses .
support your conclusions , having a thesis isn't enough .
i want real arguments with quotations and sources .
sam kennedy , san benito police .
nice to meet you .
lisa !
sam kennedy , from san benito police .
start time .
let's see . . . .
it's me .
i know how they did it .
now we need to know why .
i can help with that .
i got someone here you ought to talk to .
rod , look at the dna .
the vomit is a perfect match with justin .
who paid for this?
cassie , out of her own pocket .
you'd need a jury of 1 2 forensic experts .
that's why we need a confession from one of them .
they'll talk without an attorney?
they want to prove they're smarter than we are .
okay .
so where's the other one?
who?
the hot one .
not here .
you get to work with her everyday?
yeah .
i should become a cop .
so , what's up with ray?
i hear he's like a serial killer or something .
well , actually , we have a theory on that .
it involves you and justin .
it's just a theory .
can i lay it out for you?
yeah .
therefore . . . . . . every truly free act is a crime , for crime sets one apart . . . . . . from the machinery of mass society .
it can't be a crime of profit or passion , but gratuitous and random .
crime as philosophy , as freedom .
interesting .
do you believe it?
it's a school paper .
you have to write something .
i enjoy taking indefensible positions and creating an argument for them .
but do you believe it?
so then the question is , how did you pick the victim?
was it random?
i mean , that's the way i'd do it .
that one right there , with the flowers .
she's perfect .
no , she's too skinny .
you understand what random means?
we don't choose .
don't talk to me like i'm a moron .
we have to follow the plan ...
this one !
what about this one?
don't get impatient .
wait a second .
pull up , where the girl is loading the groceries .
okay .
but you lose the point of a philosophical crime if you feel guilty .
how do you mean?
if you kill somebody to prove you're free , and then throw up ...
i didn't .
what are you talking about?
richard didn't feel guilty .
he's free , justin .
you're not .
relax .
let them wonder what we're up to .
now go in .
your coffee .
you can't smoke in here .
come on .
are we almost done?
take a seat .
so ray was an inspired choice .
but the great thing . . . . . . was how subtly you planted the fibers and hairs and stuff .
i got your product .
you did ray , right?
wasn't he your friend?
you told him to hide in his trailer , didn't you?
what are you talking about?
you went home , you said hello to your mother .
it took you 1 0 minutes to walk home from the restaurant .
mother , i'm home .
you said you had to do schoolwork so she wouldn 't look in .
and she didn 't .
she never did , did she?
i was with six friends all night .
you know that .
you talked to them .
the night , sure , but not the day .
that's the secret .
you weren't there at night .
the thing that always confused me was the muddy footprints in the house .
you know?
the planting bed was dry , so where did they come from?
it was you at the house .
justin would not have walked through the wet beds .
that was exactly 3 : 30 .
how long did you wait for her to come home?
you didn 't kill her there .
i gotta say , that was a stroke of genius .
did you think it up , or was it justin?
i don't know what you're saying .
that helped us figure out the real timetable .
that gave you time to get home for the study group .
i'll go get some cash for the pizza .
you told them you were going to the a tm to get cash .
and you did .
and i did .
then you hurried back .
that took five minutes .
it took five minutes .
now we're talking .
but you were gone 1 5 .
what are you looking at?
richard killed her .
didn't he , justin?
i think it was justin .
let me tell you something .
it'll be the most important thing you ever hear .
more important than the instructions on the sats and aps .
the person who actually killed olivia lake is gonna be executed .
or , at best , go to jail for life .
in your case that'd be about 60 years .
but the other one , who didn't actually kill her , if he cooperates . . .
. . . will have a chance at a real life .
richard was back in the study group by 9 : 25 .
so you must have dumped the body .
the planning was easy ... ... but now you had to actually do it .
and that's why the postmortem wounds were so tentative .
you were trying to be like richard , but you couldn't .
you weren't that free .
thank god .
go to hell .
my guy won't roll .
i figured he'd be the one .
no .
let's talk about lisa .
she went out with richard?
briefly .
then she got interested in justin .
let's use that .
interesting theory , but i can't admit to something i didn't do .
looks like you won't have to .
because justin is talking in there .
justin's here?
he told us about you .
about you and lisa .
which lisa?
so you really need to tell me what happened .
just think of it as a game .
whoever talks first is the winner .
justin says you betrayed him .
he told us about lisa and the tape you made .
justin's talking .
he's gonna win this thing , unless you have something to tell me .
okay , i'm gonna go see .
wait , wait .
come on , sit down .
i have to advise you of certain rights .
the interview is over .
richard's father's lawyer .
charge them or let them go .
another five minutes , we would have had both those kids .
if i ever find out who leaked to the parents , i swear . . . .
no , that's all right .
yeah , i'll talk to you tomorrow .
justin won't talk , because he needs to prove he's as tough as his buddy .
he's tougher .
yeah , maybe .
that richard , i can't wait till we nail him .
one of them is the doer , and he's going down , but there's something deeper ...
a narcissistic prick like richard doesn't care about anyone but himself .
he uses justin to feed his ego .
push him around , make him feel like a man .
in five years , no one will care he was homecoming king . . . . . . or pole vaulting champ .
i pity anyone who gets in his way .
is richard a pole vaulter?
i don't know .
i was using it as an example of , you know . . . .
look . . . .
i know about carl hudson .
where did you get that?
this is none of your god ...
this is my matter !
mine !
i knew this girl in high school . . . . . . smart enough . . . . . . but she didn't really come from anything .
and to everyone's amazement , the most popular boy liked her .
state pole vaulting champ .
you'd watch him go over that bar in the sunlight . . . . . . that golden body , it was like . . . . . . life just couldn't get any more beautiful than that .
and it didn't .
she was 1 6 when she married him .
seventeen when he knocked out her upper bicuspid .
eighteen when she decided to leave .
he put her in the hospital with a serious concussion .
a week later , when she got out . . . . . . she started packing , and he was drunk .
he pointed his finger at her .
he said , " you try that again , i'll kill you .
he took another drink . . . . . . and she headed for the door .
why didn't she wait till he was out?
left for work?
she couldn't , she had to go right then .
why then?
i don't know .
it was because . . . .
because she . . . .
it wasn't about getting away from him , it was about standing up to him .
even if it killed her .
i guess so .
so he stabbed her 1 7 times with a kitchen knife . . . . . . and dumped her body on a country road .
yeah , ruined my favorite dress .
carl hudson .
cutest boy i ever saw . . . . . . until richard haywood .
and you're supposed to testify at carl's parole hearing .
what are you gonna say?
nothing .
i'm not going .
i'm not .
you gotta go up there , you have to .
no .
i don't have to .
the girl was jessica marie hudson .
i have nothing to say about her .
you just inherited her scars .
look , i made a deal .
the deal was that she died there .
she's in the ground , and i can go on with my life .
except you can't .
all you think about is carl hudson .
he's every case .
he's every guy you date .
your whole world is carl hudson .
is that the life you're going on with?
did you ever get help for any of this?
yeah .
i became a cop .
you can't just pretend it didn't happen .
it's not that simple , cass .
it has to be .
because if it gets any more complicated , i can't make it .
richard haywood is on line one .
swanson .
so you want to talk to me about this covington woman?
yes , i know all about it .
what can i do for you?
i just thought you'd want to know what really happened .
i thought it was a game .
how do you pick a victim?
how do you get away with it?
we were bored .
i never took it seriously until i walk in the room , and she's laying there . . . .
did you make a deal with him?
he says he wasn't there ...
did you make a deal?
i don't make deals over the phone , but if it checks out . . . . . . and we can get a conviction , i will .
fine .
let's get warrants now .
where are you going?
you're not supposed to leave without telling us .
will you be back for dinner?
justin's not here .
his mother doesn't even know when he left .
similar story here .
what about goldilocks?
get over there and see what she knows .
you should take a look downstairs .
i gotta go .
bye .
i didn't know where else to go .
tell me what's going on .
the cops are asking about you and richard .
i don't know what to say .
we killed a woman .
no , you didn't .
yes , we did .
he made you do it .
it wasn't just richard .
but he drove it .
it was his idea .
you would have never done anything like this by yourself .
he seduced you . . .
. . . just like he seduced me .
you know what you have to do .
you have to tell them everything .
i will .
i don't have any feelings left .
except for you .
that's him .
don't answer it .
where are you?
are you with her?
no .
yes , you are .
and you told her about us , didn 't you?
did you tell her everything?
where are you?
i left home .
all right?
i'm gone .
i'm never going back .
it's over .
i know .
we have to turn ourselves in .
and go to prison?
and be punks?
and eat shit for the rest of our lives? !
do you remember what we talked about?
yes .
meet me at the bluff in an hour .
okay?
okay .
i have to meet him .
to do what?
i just have to .
i wish i met you first .
cassie mayweather .
have a seat .
so this is what we talked about .
glory or nothing .
should we say the words for the last time?
one cannot live fully without embracing suicide and crime .
say it .
a pact made with relentless fire that requires that while some live . . . . . . others die .
on three .
one .
two .
three .
what are you doing?
i have the bullets , right?
what about you?
open your chamber .
open it !
you were gonna watch me kill myself?
they're here at the old wintu lodge .
roger .
that's up off highland road?
so since i have the bullets and the guts to use them . . . . . . i'll shoot you , and then i'll shoot myself , okay?
no .
no?
why?
would you rather go to prison and be a punk?
or do you think you'll beat prison?
because you made a deal .
you talked .
you talked !
why don't you shoot me?
shoot me in the head , in the heart .
whatever you want .
do it .
doesn't matter anymore .
pull the fucking trigger .
pull it !
come on !
justin , don't .
we have to pay for what we did .
not like that .
put the gun down .
put it down .
please don't .
justin , listen to me .
for me .
come over here , next to me .
don't listen to her .
don't !
hands off !
stay put .
people are on the way .
hey , richard?
you think you're so smart , huh?
justin's smarter than you , remember that .
i got one left .
to hell with it .
... every night , the same fucking thing?
listen !
listen to me !
you are not going out that door , jess !
you are not going out that door !
justin , please !
justin , please .
don't !
justin !
justin , don't !
no , no !
don't !
grab it .
i got it .
thank you , thank you .
i'm okay , thank you .
what's gonna happen to me?
since you weren't the actual killer , and what you did down there for me . . . .
don't worry about it , i'll take care of you .
you all right?
whisper something into my ear .
what?
just anything .
remember what i said about looking for new partners?
are you serious?
where was it?
i want to take that back .
did they find the videotape?
yes .
how's he doing?
he looks okay .
but we're gonna transport him for treatment .
why did you let richard videotape the killing?
that was really stupid , like you guys wanted to get caught .
what are you talking about?
oh , you don't know?
they found a hidden camera in richard's basement .
that's how he filmed himself with lisa .
he filmed the killing too .
the d. a. is looking at it now .
look , whatever is on that tape . . . .
whatever's on that tape what?
is there really a tape?
maybe i should talk to a lawyer .
absolutely .
no , wait a second .
wait !
i thought richard manipulated you , but it was the other way around .
these marks are from richard's ring when he tried to strangle me .
there are none of these marks on olivia's neck .
richard could have taken off that ring to make it look like ray did it .
the ring has nothing to do with it .
tell me what happened . . . . . . and i'll do my best to get you tried as a juvenile .
you have to believe me .
when i went over there , i had no idea .
i never thought i'd ...
oh , god .
are you gonna do it or what?
i can't .
fuck ... !
so , what , i have to do it?
you don't do anything .
you just have ideas .
and you're so full of shit too .
crime is not an idea , it's an act .
anybody can think it .
only free men can do it .
i'm free .
give me the gloves .
give them to me .
thank you .
i had to show him .
i could have let you die up there , but i didn't .
thank you .
wait !
i just want a chance .
i wanna start over .
i wanna ...
it doesn't work that way .
you get one life .
and whatever you do with it , whatever's done to you . . . . . . you gotta face that .
you can't pretend it didn't happen .
jessica marie hudson?
jessica marie hudson .
for the carl hudson parole hearing?
jessica marie hudson?
that's me .
