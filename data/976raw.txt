i'm just going to get some flowers , dear .
it's tulip season today and i'm so happy .
son of a bitch .
come on , sweetie .
come on , sweetie .
come on now , sweetheart .
go for a little ride , then you can whiz all over the city .
come on , go for a ride .
no !
freeze !
leg down !
leg down !
that's it .
come on .
no !
you monkey eared son of a ...
you have pissed your last floor .
i'll bet you wish you were a real ...
you dog eared monkey .
this is new york .
if you can make it here you can make it anywhere .
verdell?
verdell?
where's my good doggie?
verdell?
come here , sweetheart .
mr. udall?
have you seen verdell?
what does he look like?
my dog .
you know ...
my dog with the adorable face .
don't you know what it looks like?
you were talking about your dog .
i thought it was that coloured man .
which colour was that?
thick molasses with a broad nose .
perfect for smelling prison food .
frank !
you have got to get dressed .
frank sachs .
melvin udall .
frank shows my work , mr. udall .
i think you know that .
as long as you keep your work zipped up , around me ,
i don't care where you shove your show .
are we done being neighbours?
let me ...
no !
not worth it .
hope you find him .
love that dog .
you don't love anything .
one , two , three , four , five .
one , two , three , four , five .
hot .
hot , hot , hot .
where is he?
he had a thing with the dog .
ugly dog .
he's adorable .
my honey .
where have you been?
look at my boy .
i found him , mr. bishop .
we know you did .
where was my baby?
ln the basement garbage bin eating diaper shit .
you earned your fun , john .
it just struck me as funny .
how did he get down there?
even if he got in the elevator ...
maybe some nice neighbour shoved him down the garbage chute .
ln the dark she had confessed and he had forgiven .
this is what you live for , he said .
two heads on a pillow .
all is approval .
there is only the safety of being with each other .
how could she find such hope in the most shameful part of her?
mr. udall !
" she was able to define love .
love was ...
mr. udall , i'd like to speak to you .
let me do this by myself .
" love was ...
are you in there?
pansy assed stool pusher !
yes?
this can wait .
i found verdell , mr. udall .
well ...
that's a load off .
did you ... do something to him?
do you realize that i work at home?
do you like being interrupted when you're playing in your garden?
no , i turn the ringer off on my phone .
and put a piece of cardboard ...
i work all the time .
so never interrupt me !
not if you hear the sound of a thud from my home ,
and one week later there's a smell from a decaying human body ,
and you have to hold a hanky to your face because of the stench .
even then , don't come knocking .
or if it's election night and you want to celebrate ,
because some fudge packer was elected the first queer president .
and he's going to have you down to camp david ,
and you want someone to share the moment with .
even then , don't knock .
not on this door .
not for any reason .
do you get me , sweetheart?
yes .
it's not a subtle point that you are making .
okay , then .
so , now he will think twice before messing with me .
love was ...
what was love?
love was ...
now i'm really pissed !
don't touch !
shut up !
you don't intimidate me with your attitude .
i grew up in hell , homeboy .
my grandmother had more attitude .
police !
doughnut munching morons !
help me !
assault !
and you're black !
i like simon enough to batter you unrecognizable ,
if you verbally abuse him or touch that dog again .
meantime ...
i'll think of some way that you can make it up to him .
i hate doing this !
i'm an art dealer .
have a nice day .
party !
don't touch .
get a life .
watch it .
look at you .
you're better .
new medication .
you know all my son's stuff?
i've got a date tonight .
i'm walking out the door , he says , " i promise not to get a cough .
lsn't that sweet?
a little blond angel .
i said , " you love me the way you love your remote control .
that's great .
people that talk in metaphors ought to shampoo my crotch .
eat up !
i've got your money .
pay me next week .
i owe you and i told you today .
excuse me , melvin .
there you go .
pardon me .
take the money .
take a cab home and get ready .
ready is not my problem .
i'm starving .
you're not allowed back here .
spence is more excited about it than i am .
sometimes , these kids , you just want to ...
i've got jews at my table .
it's not your table .
you can sit at someone else's station .
or you can wait your turn .
how much more have you got to eat?
appetites aren't as big as your noses , huh?
that's it !
let's go .
he's barred for life .
they left .
yeah , what do you know?
bryan says , if you ever act like this again you are barred for life .
i'm going to miss the excitement .
three eggs , over easy .
sausage , bacon , fries .
fries today?
a short stack .
coffee with cream and sweetener .
you'll die soon , with that diet .
we're all gonna die .
you and i are , and it sounds like your son will .
if you ever mention my son again ... ... you will never be able to eat here again .
do you understand?
give me some sign you understand , or leave now .
do you understand me , you crazy fuck?
do you?
yes ...
i'll get your order .
wear my earrings tonight .
it's just so interesting .
you said it like it was nothing .
where's the bedroom?
this is sort of it ...
i sort of sleep in here .
don't worry about it .
what?
i don't know .
grandma ...
maybe you better check .
what did you think i was going to?
i'm sorry .
i was hearing everything ...
i put these on to give you privacy .
how was dinner?
how was your friend?
are you okay?
scootch over .
where did he take you to eat?
a nice place .
i have him ...
one more spit?
he's waiting .
go .
give me a hug .
carol .
carol , i have him .
she has me .
go .
close the curtains .
no !
he can't take smoke .
magic .
god !
that'll teach you .
i don't even notice it any more .
come here .
it's a little bit of throw up .
" little bit of throw up "?
what shall we do?
shall i write down which train you take , or should we lay ...
no .
i'll take a cab .
it's just a little too much reality for a friday night .
i promised simon i'd find him a model .
take me offthe speaker .
these are house seats .
come on .
you could use a break .
hello?
carl?
you there?
okay .
i just found a model .
hey , boys !
i know this guy .
what's going on?
hi .
remember?
i only need one .
you picked me up some time ago .
this is for a portrait .
portrait?
come here .
i'll give you the address .
brad pitt .
it's the shit .
do you read?
who is it , baby?
who is it , verdell?
i'm sorry .
i told you today .
i was out in the studio and i ...
it's out here .
you have great things .
gershwin .
great , isn't he?
i make a big deal about picking models , but carl is so thorough .
i bet he drove you nuts checking your rsum .
this is not a nude .
just kidding around .
so much for love .
and yet another pose .
what is your previous experience?
i'm running out of ideas here .
give me some direction .
i just watch .
until something strikes me .
do anything you think of .
wait until i say to hold that pose , then just try to hold it .
no direction .
what i do is , i watch .
ever watch somebody who doesn't know you're watching them?
an old woman sitting on a bus?
or kids going to school?
somebody just waiting , and you see this flash come over them .
and you know it has nothing to do with anything external .
they're just sort of realer and more alive .
you look at someone long enough , you discover their humanity .
i know exactly what you mean .
oh , my god ...
hold it .
look out .
excuse me .
i got on the third line of dialogue .
and all of a sudden i blanked .
clippity clop . lgnores me .
so he said to me , " last chance .
last chance .
i came back in .
here she comes to ignore me again .
i messed up the same line .
but guess what?
he cast me !
just what the world needs .
another actress .
can't live without me?
i'm finally going to ask .
what's with the plastic picnicware?
are you afraid ours isn't clean?
it's a judgment call .
give yourself a pep talk .
must try other people's clean silverware when dining out .
what's wrong with your son?
what do you care?
he fights to breathe .
his asthma can shoot off the charts .
his immune system fails when there's trouble , so an ear infection ...
ls this bothering you?
no .
an ear infection , anything , sends him to the emergency room ,
where i get some nine year old they just made a doctor .
nice chatting .
his name?
spencer .
spence .
it's okay .
go on .
put on anything you want .
i might be sort of done here .
all we do is work .
let's play !
so you're practically finished?
yeah .
there is one more stage .
where are you going?
no place .
just to sneak a peek .
verdell , you want some chocolate?
he's not allowed .
wait !
i got to take off .
do you want to say goodbye?
yeah .
he's just got to go .
wait .
i'm going to look at the painting .
where are you going?
want some water?
what's the matter?
you want some water?
simon , wait !
why are you doing this?
no , wait ...
that painting in there ...
are you cruising him?
excuse me ...
help me !
come on !
come on .
you call 91 1 and don't leave your name?
even a dumb geezer knows ...
just move on .
no one was killed .
ask him .
don't bark at me .
i didn't name you .
we will .
and if he can't , we'll come back and ask you .
hey .
i come from hell .
my grandma has got more attitude than you .
go shake down a 7 1 1 for a day old wiener .
there's a painting of one of the guys .
i've been praying for him .
i'm on my way to the hospital .
just watch the dog for tonight .
no , no .
i'm sorry .
thanks .
old bitch .
damn dog .
you're taking him !
get out of the way !
even the books .
wait !
do you want to say no to me?
i don't want to say nothing to you .
because i've never felt this crazy .
i almost want you to say no .
thanks for looking after him .
hey !
where are you going?
you don't want to mess with me .
i can't take a dog .
nobody's been in here before .
hey , frank .
one , two , three , four ...
you're dead .
we don't have no dog food here .
you'll eat what we got .
what we eat .
don't you do anything !
where's the trust?
never a break .
god !
we're halfway through the show and we haven't sold a painting .
no , we can't reduce the price .
i'm in a free fall here .
we can see him .
i'll meet you in there , okay?
thank you .
how are you doing , great one?
i haven't looked at myself yet .
i figured i could tell from your reaction .
that bad?
i talked to the doctor and ...
it's not that bad .
the doctors say you'll be your old self again .
the scars might ...
oh , shit !
jackie ...
hand me a mirror , please .
wait .
i have a smaller one .
so how are things , anyway?
how is verdell?
mr. udall ... taking care of him .
how could you?
he'll hurt him .
no , i promise .
not a chance .
i own this guy .
besides , there was nobody else .
i'm always on the move and ...
trust me .
you are certain my dog is okay?
yes , your dog is fine .
waiting gives the devil time .
oh , my !
where did i go?
that's your dog?
no .
what are you doing with a dog?
suckered in , set up .
you're not worried he'll be taken?
no , not until now .
sorry .
i'm going to sit here .
hey , puppy .
it's so cute .
i wonder what breed he is .
he's a little dog .
if bryan's not here , you can bring him in .
how old are you?
to guess by your eyes ... 50 .
by your eyes , i'd say you were kind .
so much for eyes .
how old are you?
you brought it up .
i'm curious .
not that you're ugly .
i can take the compliment .
but my knees start knocking when you turn on the charm full blast .
what's with the dark?
dawn patrol .
my son had a full blown attack .
and for extra fun they gave us the wrong antibiotics .
no !
it's bacon for the dog .
last week i was playing the piano for him .
and he likes it .
so i decide i'm going to make a little joke .
it's a beautiful day for our walk .
look at that dog .
i've got to give you something real good .
i'm going to show it to you .
don't be like me .
stay as you are .
you're perfect .
i'll get you something to eat .
i'd like to be treated like that .
let's go home and do some writing .
he had made the girl happy .
and what a girl .
you've saved my life , she said .
you'd better make it up to me .
done !
yes , i hate the doggie .
62 books .
done .
we have to cut back all expenses .
he has no medical insurance?
these are the food receipts , the household expenses .
here's one for the dog again .
i got it .
and all the laundry .
boy , look at that .
he likes it at chez melvin .
what are you coming over here for?
i can't cook with a dog near me .
just sit .
we don't want any company .
i'll read you emerson .
how's verdell doing?
he's a pain in the ass .
simon's home .
can you keep the dog until he's had a chance to adjust?
it's been weeks and weeks .
a few more won't matter .
he wants him back right away .
he'll be by tomorrow .
okay .
hungry?
be right with you .
mr. udall .
some face they left hanging on you .
you look like ...
could you take it ... ... just a little easy , mr. udall?
thank you .
verdell .
come here , my beautiful boy .
come here .
let's go home and get well .
i can't blame him for being weird .
look at yourself in the mirror .
thank you .
come on , sweetheart .
verdell , come here .
i know what you want .
where's my boy?
no , don't force him .
over a dog !
over an ugly dog .
worst sidewalk in new york .
look where they put it .
help !
you'll make an appointment .
how can you diagnose someone as an obsessive compulsive disorder
and then act like i had a choice about barging in?
you must leave .
you said you could help me .
what was that?
a tease?
if you take responsibility ...
you changed the room around .
two years ago .
i also grew a beard , but you're not interested in changes in me .
i don't have a mountain of time .
i have to get to my restaurant .
do you know how hard it was for me to come here?
no , we're not doing this now .
i changed just one pattern , as you always said i should .
no .
nope .
what if this is as good as it gets?
what the heck are those for?
no , no , no .
get carol .
i'm filling in .
she might be getting a job closer to home .
why plastic?
what are you trying to do to me?
what do you mean?
look , elephant girl .
go get carol or something .
just have her do my one meal here .
i'll pay whatever you want .
do it !
bryan .
code blue .
out !
just shut up and get out .
i'll be quiet .
just let me stay here .
no problem .
go get carol .
i'm not a prick .
you are .
i'm not judging .
this day has been a disaster .
i'm not sure if i can handle this .
get out !
get out immediately or there's going to be trouble .
see you .
it's about time .
carol's last name?
connelly .
does he visit often?
not really .
not any more .
i'm hungry .
you've ruined my whole day .
i haven't eaten .
what are you doing here?
this is not a sexist thing ...
are you totally gone?
this is my home .
i'm trying to keep emotion aside , even though it's important .
i have strong feelings on this .
what?
that i wasn't there?
do you have any control over how creepy you get?
yes , i do .
and to prove it ...
i have not gotten personal , and you have .
why aren't you at work?
are you sick?
you don't look sick .
just tired and bitter .
my son is sick .
what about your mother?
how do you know about her?
i hear you talking while i wait .
mom , i finished my juice .
one sec .
how are you doing?
you should answer me .
sorry , melvin .
i can't handle you teaching my son manners .
back to life .
what's wrong?
five one thousand , four one thousand ...
104 . 9 .
we're going on a cab ride .
look out , you guys !
look out .
we're okay .
we're okay .
melvin !
wait !
melvin !
wait !
shut up , kids !
give us a lift , would you?
cover your mouth when you cough .
brooklyn presbyterian hospital .
hospital?
any chance you'll be back today?
no !
stay away from me .
we can't put this off any longer .
i feel terrible that i have to ...
could you just leave the dog for a second?
sorry .
what are those cards?
frank thought i should have notes .
so i would maintain focus and not terrify you .
see?
he's right .
i need the cards .
slmon , you're broke
the medical bills are 61, 000 now .
and the show didn't go well .
i spoke to your parents .
they didn't hang up or anything .
but they'd feel strange calling you .
i can't call them .
come here , baby .
come here .
verdell?
what's wrong?
you miss the tough guy?
well , here i am .
happy to see me , you little mop?
how about a ride down the chute?
i'm sorry .
i didn't mean that .
i didn't mean that , sweetheart .
sorry ...
i'll be able to keep my apartment and the studio , won't i?
oh , my god !
yes , you make us a lot of money .
but it's more appropriate ...
i need this .
just say , " melvin , i'll try .
melvin , i'll try .
thank you .
my son just got accepted to brown .
my husband was dying .
good , nice , thrilled , exciting .
you don't have to wait with me .
i can't resist .
i just have so many questions i want to ask you .
you have no idea what your work means to me .
what does it mean to you?
that somebody out there knows what it's like to be in here .
god , this is like a nightmare .
come on .
just a couple of questions .
how do you write women so well?
i think of a man .
and i take away reason and accountability .
mom !
ln here , mrs. connelly .
please , what?
i'm ...
tell me !
dr. bettes .
not your name .
where is he?
he's in the bathroom .
what's wrong?
you know there are doctors that come to your house?
i'm home .
i didn't know you had an admirer .
oh , you met the gift .
he's good .
i'm an expert on doctors .
okay , doctor?
my wife is melvin udall's publisher .
i'm to take care of this little guy because you are needed at work .
what kind of work do you do?
i'm a waitress .
ln manhattan .
dr. bettes?
excuse me .
i'm sorry it took so long .
i couldn't find it , either .
could you get this to the lab?
i want it back today .
did you say " today "?
yes .
let's sit down .
these are the receipts from all the prescriptions for the year .
the calendar .
this is a calendar of days .
and how he felt .
good .
how long has he had the problem?
since forever .
six months old .
have they done blood tests?
when he was well?
no .
and how about skin testing?
no .
no standard scratch test?
no .
they said my plan didn't cover it .
why?
should they have?
fucking hmo bastard pieces of shit !
i'm sorry .
that's their technical name .
once the tests come back , is there someone we should talk to?
me .
my home number is on the card .
his home number .
what?
your home ...
can we get you anything else?
no , thank you .
couple of female slaves?
there's still a lot of tests i need to do .
whatever i find out , i promise you ,
from now on your son is going to feel a great deal better .
doc !
that's good .
let me know about the costs .
one way or another we'll ...
the costs are going to be considerable .
but mr. udall wants to be billed .
that's wonderful .
thank you for everything , nora .
forgive my crankiness .
i'll call when things get back on track .
what's wrong?
who's going to walk verdell?
no !
ls he dead yet?
no .
would there be any way you would be willing to walk his dog for him?
absolutely .
you're a wonderful man .
two o'clock would be a good time .
here is the key in case he's asleep .
open his curtains for him so he can see god's beautiful work .
and he'll know that even things like this happen for the best .
did you learn to talk like this in a " sailor , wanna hump hump " bar?
or is this your last shot at his whisky?
sell crazy someplace else .
we're all stocked up here .
no !
a goofy man is behind this .
you can't block out that man .
do you really want to go back to emergency , where they can't help?
this lets a crazy man into our lives .
you know how this will turn out .
this is not like a string of pearls .
you don't send this one back .
right?
no .
i do , i understand .
listen .
i have to go , okay?
frlends to ask for money
bye .
bye bye .
what a day ...
maybe i'll bring him some food by .
thank you for walking him .
excuse me , i'm not feeling well .
this place smells like shit .
go away .
this cleaning lady doesn't ..?
please , just leave .
what happened to your friends?
get out of here !
there's nothing worse than having to feel this way in front of you .
nellie .
your a disgrace to depression .
rot in hell , melvin .
no need to stop being a lady .
you'll be back on your knees in no time .
ls this fun for you?
it keeps getting better and better .
i'm losing my apartment , melvin .
frank wants me to beg my parents , who haven't called me , for help .
and i won't .
i don't want to paint any more .
the life i was trying for , is over .
the life i had is gone and i'm feeling sorry for myself .
it's high times for you , isn't it?
the gay neighbour is terrified .
terrified !
i was trying to give you a boost .
lucky you .
you're here for rock bottom .
you absolute horror of a human being .
the one thing i'll do for you might cheer you up .
get out .
you want to know why the dog prefers me?
it's not affection .
it's a trick .
i keep bacon in my pocket .
see?
we'll both call him .
you'll see .
it's a trick .
come here , verdell .
come on .
come here .
just a stupid dog .
could you leave now?
please?
i don't get it .
mr. udall !
carol the waitress?
yes .
the doctors gave me your address .
i'm sorry about the hour .
if you ...
if it's about thanking me ...
that's not why i'm here .
though it's nice to talk to a real doctor about spencer .
note .
put it in a note .
i have a hairdryer .
why did you do this for me?
so you'd come back to work .
that sounds strange .
i'm worried you did this ...
are you waiting for me to say something?
look ...
i'll be there tomorrow .
i need to clear this up now .
clear what up?
i'm not going to sleep with you .
i will never sleep with you .
not ever !
i'm sorry , but ... ... we don't open for the no sex oaths until 9 a . m .
i'm not kidding .
anything else?
just ... thank you .
so you will be at work tomorrow?
yes .
never " , she said .
i took a chance you were up .
i brought you some chinese soup .
thanks .
i've never been this tired in my life .
i haven't been sleeping .
i haven't been clear in my head or felt like myself .
i'm in trouble .
it's not just the tiredness .
sick .
nauseous .
sleepy .
everything looks distorted and everything inside aches .
you can barely find the will to complain .
i'm glad we did this .
good talking to you .
still writing that thank you note?
how do you spell " conscience "?
c o n s c i e n c e.
look , i got sean to babysit so we could go out .
i don't feel safe leaving spencer with someone .
spencer's okay .
start finding something to do with your free time .
sean , are you hungry?
we got pizza .
sausage , pepperoni .
you want to make this later?
we are going out , like people do .
if you can't feel good about this break and step out a little ,
then you ought to have mr. udall send you over a psychiatrist .
i don't need one .
i know what's going on here .
i must finish this letter first .
this can't be right?
con science?
carol !
what?
it's very weird not feeling that ... ... stupid panic thing inside me .
without that , i start thinking about myself .
and what good does that ever get anybody?
today on the bus there was this adorable couple .
and i felt myself ... ... giving them a dirty look .
i just had no idea .
everything was ...
go ahead .
moving in the wrong direction .
away from a time when i remembered what it was like to have a man ... ... to hold fucking ...
... hands with .
i felt almost really bad that dr. bettes is married .
which is probably why i make spence hug me more than he wants to .
he has to make up for his mom not getting any .
who needs these thoughts?
so , are you frustrated?
leave me be .
what is it you want?
does getting me thinking about all that's wrong have some purpose?
really , mom , what is it you want?
what?
i want us to go out .
thank you .
i'll send you a thank you note .
that's why you brought me here?
that's why you brought me here?
well , it's not even mine .
simon has enough on his mind .
but the dog did throw up twice last night .
take him to the vet .
i did .
his stomach's out of whack .
they need him a couple of days .
well , do it ...
sorry .
this is for later .
what's this?
it's a note .
a note?
a thank you note .
no thank you .
you can read it later .
no thank you note .
no , no .
thank you .
she's nice .
yeah , really nice .
shouldn't that be a good thing , saying , " no thanks required "?
sure looks like it went over , too .
look at you .
you're making the rounds .
simon says you brought him soup .
what?
you think i'm a mark ...
you helped with the dog .
i'm as concerned about simon as you are .
concerned?
he needs more than money .
he must go to baltimore to ask his parents for money tomorrow .
they have to help .
it's the rules .
that's great .
let them help him .
only ... ...
i got a painter coming through , so i'm out .
can you drive him?
think white and get serious !
take my car?
a convertible .
do you drive?
yes .
but i'm not doing it .
getting loud .
he wants me to take his car ...
i want your problems .
somebody offers me a convertible so i can get out of this city ...
go ahead , girl .
okay .
i'll do it .
i'll take him .
get him packed .
tomorrow morning i'll take him .
i'll see you tomorrow .
let's not drag this out .
if there's some health foundation for people like you , let me know .
last word freak .
good luck , lady .
anything else?
yeah .
i'm going to give my queer neighbour a lift to baltimore .
what i did for you ...
it's working out?
what you did changed my life .
no !
no thank you note .
well , part of what i said in this entire history of my life
is that you have done more for my mother , my son ... ... and me than anybody else ever has .
i'm just going to read you this part of it
that makes you the most generous person i ever met in my life .
and you're going to be in our daily prayers , forever .
lovely .
i also wrote one part ...
i wrote that i was sorry .
i was talking about how i was sorry when i got mad at you
when you told my son that he ought to answer back .
i wrote that i was sorry about that .
i'm sorry for that night ... ... when i said that i was never ...
i'm sorry for every time your food was cold and you had to wait .
and i'm sorry for never spotting the human being that did this for us .
i'll just start from the beginning .
i have not been able to express my gratefulness to you .
the word grateful doesn't begin to tell you what i feel .
that's nice of you .
thank you .
thank you .
now i want you to do something for me .
i'm sorry .
didn't i say " what "?
i thought i did .
what?
i want you to go on this trip .
no , sir .
i can't do this without you .
he might pull the stiff one eye on me .
i need you to chaperone .
you said you liked convertibles .
now i'm on the hook .
two days .
i can't .
my son .
bettes said he's doing fine .
melvin , i'd rather not .
write a note .
ain't she sweet?
i need a hand and where is she?
your help obligates me?
ls there any other way to see it?
no .
here's a little suitcase .
shocked that it's being used .
there's no way to pack for this trip .
you're still coming , aren't you?
yes .
melvin , exactly where are we going?
just south of baltimore .
i know what you're going to say .
i mean ...
i think i know .
i'm not sure , but i think so .
should i bring something dressy?
will we be eating in restaurants that have dress codes?
maybe ...
yes .
let's ...
let's .
okay .
what did you think i'd ask?
whether crabs were in season now .
okay , then .
goodnight .
anything unusual in his diet?
no .
everybody gets their own cage?
put him in with that one .
lip kiss .
i love you .
i'll miss you ...
real sensitive .
bye .
call when you're settled .
have a good time .
don't run !
have fun , but don't run .
i'm sorry i'm not taking you .
so am i , frank .
give me a hug .
everything's going to be okay .
soak it up .
it's your last chance for a hug for a few days .
hello .
thank you for being on time .
carol the waitress .
simon the fag .
holy god .
who did that to you?
i was attacked .
i walked in on some men robbing me .
and i was hospitalized .
i almost died .
let's do the small talk later .
i was going to do that .
where should we sit?
there's no place cards .
you need room .
so i'll sit in the back .
never a break .
never .
thank you .
it was very thoughtful .
you look like you're crowded .
it's all right .
thanks .
thank you .
you're welcome .
i've got the whole trip programmed .
i just wanted to see what you'd do .
to use as lcebreaker
we've got good stuff here .
i like this music .
i like this music .
i'm sure they did something really off .
but something will always be off for you , unless you set it straight .
and maybe this thing happened to you to give you a chance to do that .
nonsense .
you want to know why?
anyone interested in what melvin has to say , raise their hand .
want to know what happened with my parents?
when i was ...
wait .
i'm going to pull over .
i always painted .
and my mom always encouraged me .
she was sort of fabulous about it .
she ...
i was too young to think there was anything wrong with it .
and she was very natural .
so she used to pose nude for me .
i always thought that my father knew about it .
this stuff is pointless .
let him finish .
do you want to hear my sad story?
stop !
go ahead .
don't let him stop you .
one day he walked in and found us .
and he started screaming .
my father didn't come out for 1 1 years .
he used to hit me with a yardstick if i made a mistake on the piano .
go ahead , simon .
so he came in and he was yelling?
please , come on .
he was ...
i was defending my mother .
i was trying to make peace in the lamest way .
i said , " she's not naked .
it's art .
and he started hitting me .
he beat me unconscious .
and he talked to me less and less .
he knew what i was before i did .
the morning i left for college he walked into my room .
he held out his hand .
and it was filled with money .
a big sweaty wad of money .
and he said , " i don't want you to ever come back .
i just grabbed him and i hugged him .
and he turned and walked out .
we all have these stories .
it's not true .
some of us have great stories .
that take place at lakes with boats and friends and noodle salad .
no one here .
but a lot of people .
that's their story ...
good times , noodle salad .
it's not that you had it bad ,
but that you're that pissed that so many others had it good .
no !
i don't think so .
not it at all , really .
not it at all?
let's go to the hotel .
you'll see if you can get another wad of sweaty money out of his hand .
can i ask you a personal question?
sure .
you ever get an erection over a woman?
wouldn't your life be easier ..?
you consider your life easy?
i give you that one .
nice packing .
hey , spence .
hey , mom .
wait till you hear ...
why are you out of breath?
mom , lscored a goal .
you did?
yep .
he was big .
charlie .
that's great .
oh my god !
we're playing again .
got to go .
wait ...
he scored a goal .
i don't believe it .
you would have died .
my son was outside playing soccer .
take me out dancing .
dancing?
i can't .
i'm exhausted .
oh , come on .
no .
all right .
are you sad or something?
no .
i'm nervous .
it would be very rough , carol , if you weren't along .
i'm happy .
and you're my date .
let's get dressed .
i'm going to jump in the shower .
i'll be right with you .
all set?
do you sell hard shell crabs?
yes .
do they sell hard shells?
yes .
do they sell hard shells?
yes .
good evening .
you have hard shells , right?
stop asking .
you can answer .
yes , we do .
i can give you a tie and jacket .
what?
they require a tie and jacket .
no .
i'm not putting that on .
and i won't let you inject me with plague .
it's a nice place .
you dry clean these all the time , don't you?
i don't think so .
you just wait here .
good evening .
i need a coat and tie .
come on in .
no?
that one .
and this tie .
excuse me .
she's here .
we saved a table for you .
should i get her for you?
no .
i'll just watch .
ma'am ...
you look so se ...
you look great .
you look great .
you want to dance?
i've been thinking about that since you brought it up before .
no .
i don't get this place .
they make me buy a new outfit and let you in in a housedress .
what?
wait .
where are you going?
why?
i didn't mean it that way .
sit down .
give me the dirty look .
pay me a compliment , melvin .
i need one .
quick .
what you just said hurt my feelings .
the minute someone gets that they need you they threaten to walk out .
a compliment is something nice about somebody else .
now or never .
and mean it .
can we order first?
two hard shell crab dinners ...
pitcher of cold beer .
baked or fries?
fries .
fries .
one baked , one fried .
i'll tell your waiter .
i've got a great compliment for you .
and it's true .
i'm afraid it's something awful .
don't be pessimistic .
okay .
here i go .
clearly a mistake .
i've got this ... ailment .
my doctor , a shrink i used to go to ,
says that in 50 or 60 percent of the cases a pill really helps .
i hate pills .
very dangerous thing .
i'm using the word " hate " here about pills .
my compliment is , the night you came over and told me you would never ...
all right , you know what you said .
my compliment to you is ,
the next morning i started taking the pills .
how is that a compliment for me?
you make me want to be a better man .
that's maybe the best compliment of my life .
maybe i overshot a bit to keep you from walking out .
how's it going with those pills?
good , i hope , i hope , i hope .
it's little by little .
it's exhausting talking like this .
exhausting .
do you ever let a romantic moment make you do something stupid?
never .
here's the trouble with never .
you don't owe me that .
that wasn't payment .
when i first saw you i thought you were handsome .
then , of course , you spoke .
so now that your ... soft underbelly is all exposed ...
tell me , why did you bring me here?
well , i ...
that's a personal question .
tell me , even if you're scared .
scared?
tell me why you wanted me here .
if you ask me , i'll say yes .
i ...
there's a lot of reasons .
if you had sex with simon ...
what?
that's just one idea .
that's why you brought me?
like i'm a what ..?
and i owe you what?
i don't know why i brought you .
it was just one thought .
it came out first .
you kiss him ... me ...
you two seemed to hit it off .
wait .
i didn't mean ...
forget what i said about simon .
i'll never forget it .
a mistake .
it was a mistake .
hello , this is fred bishop .
we're unable to take yourcall .
leave a message .
say goodbye ... and thank you .
it's simon .
i'm in town .
you've never been out later than ten o'clock .
pick up the phone .
really .
i'm going to try you in the morning .
i need to see you .
or at least get you to answer the phone .
how are you?
ls this going to be your room?
our room .
i don't want to see him .
what happened?
don't ask .
can you not be so violent?
i don't think so .
i'm taking a big bath .
are you okay?
don't ask .
i'm tired of my complaints .
what are you thinking about?
how to die , mostly .
can you believe , in our little mix you're the good roommate?
goodnight .
hold it .
i have to draw you .
i have to draw you .
no .
i'm more shy than people think .
i have to .
i haven't sketched in weeks .
stop staring .
do a vase .
but you're beautiful , carol .
your skin , your long neck .
the back .
the line of you .
you're why cavemen chiselled on walls .
cut me a break .
the next thing i know she's sitting next to me .
it's not right to go into details .
i got nervous .
i said the wrong thing .
where , if i hadn't ,
i could be in bed now with a woman who ...
if you make her laugh , you got a life .
lnstead , i'm here with you .
no offence , but a moron pushing the last legal drug .
jameson , soda back .
i don't care how you put this .
we're being naughty here , pal .
no , this is ...
this is great .
this is so great .
my hand won't even keep up .
hold it .
i'm just turning .
but hold that .
my hand's not even bothering me .
i can't get the angle with this cast .
careful .
prlvacy
i'm coming in .
it's late .
did you have sex with her?
don't you want your shampoos?
sorry .
i didn't know she was still here ...
did you have sex with her?
to hell with sex .
it was better than sex .
we held each other .
what i need , he gave me great .
i'll get dressed in a hurry .
i just love her .
how are you doing?
mom , hi .
hello , simon .
you were right we were home .
do you have to whisper?
i'm nota screamer .
it was lucky you didn't answer .
yourfatheris not feeling well .
i can't hear you .
hold on .
what are you going to do?
i get why you're angry with me ...
he's talking to his parents .
listen to me .
truly no grudges .
it was odd that you didn't come and see me when you heard i was hurt .
we almost did .
i don't want to talk about it .
the important thing is that your son is happy .
i'm working again .
good .
aboutmoney ...
no .
i'll drop you a line .
it's up to you to make the next move .
he's going to want to stay .
and they'll take a ride to the lake .
bye bye .
goodbye , dear .
we'll probably have a five hour drive .
it'll give us a chance to ...
i'm coming .
what about your parents?
no .
i'll take care of myself .
what are you talking about?
you've got real problems .
i know .
i'm a little bit nervous .
suddenly everything seems so easy .
carol , a load has been lifted .
one night wih me .
you think you're kidding .
no choice .
i've got a gift for you .
let me see ...
gorgeous .
do it .
and get the dog picked up .
i can't believe he let it stay there .
goodbye .
your luck's running .
they sub let your place .
you're homeless .
frank's got a line on a new place .
where?
does it matter?
no , it doesn't .
i'm fine .
like the hat?
i'm sorry .
for emergency use only
i don't want to hear that music .
you said you liked it .
this one has a meaning .
i don't want to hear it .
here's the keys to my apartment .
go up there and wait and i'll take carol home .
i'll take a bus .
no , i'll take you .
can you come here?
i don't care what you did for me .
what's wrong?
i don't want to know you any more .
all you do is make me feel bad .
you have my number .
let him take you home .
don't want to .
i love you .
i love you too .
don't say anything .
i've got to get a hold of frank and see where i'm hanging my hat .
i think you're going to have to camp it here .
there's verdell !
mommy and daddy are home .
sorry .
you're fun to mess with .
they rented your place furnished .
jackie said she'd bring your things .
they were going to set you up in here .
it's an extra room .
it's got good light .
i'm coming .
it's nice .
looks good .
they've even got your music , paintings , paints .
i have to say they did a good job .
it's going to be okay .
cosy , huh?
thank you , melvin .
you overwhelm me .
i love you .
i'd be the luckiest guy alive if that did it for me .
make yourself at home .
anything else in the bag?
but i was playing soccer while you were away .
i love my cookbook .
it's got wonderful recipes .
it says something with a shark .
shark with a bite .
would you like that , spencer?
and some cookies here called wasps 'nests .
where is my big hairy boy?
where is he?
where is my beautiful boy?
sweetheart !
oh , you're in bed .
no , no .
i just didn't think verdell should get too comfortable sleeping here .
the dog's already comfortable .
ls this okay?
hello ...
hi , it's me .
he took me in .
it's carol for you .
jackie brought it all over ...
just take the dog .
take the dog .
come on .
move fast .
don't limp .
good luck .
howare you doing?
not so hot .
why?
what's wrong?
was i sensible or hard on you?
maybe both .
are you being cute or crazy now?
cute .
you don't have to answer .
just listen to me .
it's really something that you're looking after simon .
and what i said on the street ...
that was a bad thing to say .
it made me sick to my stomach .
it was a bad thing to say .
and i'd be lying if i didn't say i enjoy your company .
but you do bother me .
and i know it's better for me ... ... to not have contact with you because you're not ready .
you're an old guy to not be ready .
and i'm too old to ignore that .
but there were extraordinary kindnesses that did take place .
anyway .
thanks for the trip .
goodnight .
okay if i say something now?
go ahead .
i should have danced with you .
goodnight .
are you going to talk to me?
i'm coming .
what did she say?
that i'm a great guy .
and she doesn't want contact with me .
i'm dying here .
because ... you love her .
no .
and you people are supposed to be sensitive?
then you tell me why .
you're the one who's " dying here " .
let me sleep on it .
oh , come on .
i'll figure it out .
please ...
i'm stuck .
i can't get back to my old life .
she's evicted me from my life .
did you really like it that much?
it's better than this .
if you're going to give me hope , you've got to do better .
if you can't be mildly interesting , then shut up .
i'm drowning here !
and you're describing the water .
picking on me won't help .
if that's true , i'm really in trouble .
do you know where you're lucky?
you know who you want .
i would take your seat any day .
do something .
go over there .
tonight .
it's not always good to let things calm down .
you can do this , melvin .
tell her how you feel .
i'm charged .
yes , you are .
she might kill me if i go there .
then stay .
i'll read you a story .
the best thing going for you is your willingness to humiliate yourself .
go over there .
do this .
catch her off guard .
thanks a lot .
here i go .
what's wrong?
i forgot to lock the door .
what do you want?
i'm sorry i woke you up .
i wasn't asleep .
what a break .
ls it a secret what you're doing here?
i had to see you .
because?
it relaxes me .
i'd feel better sitting outside your apartment on the curb
than any other place i can think of or imagine .
that's overstating .
i'd rather be sitting inside so i don't get my feet in the gutter .
stop .
why can't i just have a normal boyfriend?
why?
a regular boyfriend who doesn't go nuts on me .
everybody wants that .
it doesn't exist .
i'm sorry .
i didn't mean to interrupt .
boyfriend ...
come on in and try not to ruin everything by being you .
maybe we could live without the wisecracks?
maybe we could .
it feels a little confined here .
let's take a walk .
it's four in the morning .
a walk sounds a little screwy to me .
if you don't mind .
well , if you need an excuse ...
there's a bakery on the corner that'll be open soon .
that way we're not screwy , but two people that like warm rolls .
what are you doing?
i want you to hear that song .
and darling i'm neverlonely wheneveryou're in sight ...
thank you .
i was ...
i'm sorry .
whatever this is won't work .
i'm ...
what?
i'm feeling better .
it may seem that way now , but you don't know me all that well .
i'm not the answer for you .
i've got a compliment for you .
you know what?
let me talk .
i might be the only person on the earth
that knows you're the greatest woman on earth .
i might be the only one who knows how amazing you are .
and how you are with spencer .
spence .
and in every single thought you have .
how you almost always mean something that's about being straight or good .
most people miss that about you .
i wonder how they can watch you bring their food and clear tables
and never get that they just met the greatest woman alive .
and the fact that i get it makes me feel good ... ... about me .
ls that something that it's bad for you to be around?
no .
i'm going to grab you?
i didn't mean for that to be a question .
i'm going to grab you .
i know i can do better than that .
better .
definitely better .
see?
want something?
warm rolls .
excuse us .
