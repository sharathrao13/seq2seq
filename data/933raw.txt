you were too shy to look at people .
now you're a success , and someone wants to marry you .
you're not nothing , muriel .
you've made it .
can you hear the drums , fernando
i remember long ago another starry night like this
in the firelight , fernando
you were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
i could hear the distant drums and sounds of bugle calls
were coming from afar
they were closer now , fernando
every hour , every minute seemed to last eternally
i was so afraid , fernando
we were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
and i'm not ashamed to say the roar of guns and cannons
almost made me cry ... move it into the pillow .
the pillow forms a perfect sleeping cradle for your head and back .
we all have a different shape to the head and neck .
by sleeping on a pillow that fits perfectly with your shape ...
i'm back . you relieve stress on muscles  you're terrible , muriel .
muriel , daddy's so angry .
he's on his way back from the bank .
he'll want to talk to you .
all our money's gone . $12, 000 .
you didn't do anything bad with those blank cheques i gave you , did you?
you wouldn't do that to me , would you?
of course not .
there was something in the air that night did you bring me a present?
the stars were bright , fernando
they were shining there for you and me
for liberty , fernando
though we never thought that we could lose
there's no regret
if i had to do the same again where to , love?
i would , my friend , fernando
if i had to do the same again
i would , my friend , fernando

we're not talking about radiotherapy .
this is a discreet tumour .
alone .
isolated .
the operation's all we need for the moment .
for the moment?
there's a minor risk of damage to the spinal cord .
what does that mean?
it means i'm up shit creek , that's what it means .
silk chantel .
imported .
when's your big day?
your wedding day?
september .
spring . lvory .
what's your fiance's name?
bill .
well , bill's in for a big surprise .
will your mother be coming to see the dress?
no .
no , she can't .
she's in hospital .
she's got a tumour in her spine .
she has to have an operation .
we don't usually do this .
but your mother has to see how beautiful you look in that dress .
doing well .
isn't she doing well , mariel?
you're doing really well .
now this foot forward .
you can do it .
good .
now the other one .
good .
that's good .
and
i have to sit down .
come on .
i have to sit down !
all right .
i've got you .
don't panic .
swing around .
that's it .
hand back .
take a break , honey .
you're doing really well .
how can you stand this?
you push me around in this chair .
you cook for me .
you even help me dress .
i hate it !
when i lived in porpoise spit , i'd just stay in my room for hours ... and listen to abba songs .
sometimes i'd stay in there all day .
but since i've met you and moved to sydney ...
i haven't listened to one abba song .
it's because now my life's as good as an abba song .
it's as good as " dancing queen .
come off it .
promise me something .
we never go back there .
what do you mean?
i mean , i can't go back and live in porpoise spit with mum .
not in a wheelchair , not with her .
you're gonna walk .
promise we never go back .
i promise .
but you're gonna walk .
i believe there's something out there .
yeah .
i'm i'm not a sceptic about it .
i've been cheated by you
since i don't know when too many people have seen it .
there's been too much documentation .
so i made up my mind
it must come to an end taxi for the rehabilitation centre?
hang on .
i have to get my smokes .
look at me now okay .
will i ever learn i don't know how
but i suddenly lose control
there's a fire within my soul
just one look and i can hear a bell ring
one more look and i forget everything
oh oh oh , mamma mia here i go again
my , my , how can i resist you
mamma mia , does it show again
my , my , just how much i've missed you
yes , i've been broken hearted
blue since the day we parted
why , why did i ever let you go
mamma mia , now i really know
my , my , i could never let you go
i've been angry and sad about things that you do
i can't count all the times that i've told you we're through
and when you go when you slam the door keep going .
i think you know that you won't be away too long
you know that i'm not that strong
just one look and i can hear  stop the car !
beautiful .
i hope the photos help your sister out of that coma .
mariel !
what are you doing?
no nothing .
why didn't you tell me you were gonna marry tim?
who?
tim simms , your fiance the one who wants to shoot you .
now , now , now , now just a minute .
you can't come in here and threaten brides .
i don't care how unfortunate you are .
fuck off .
what is going on , mariel?
i've seen your wedding album .
you've tried on every dress in sydney .
that doesn't mean i'm getting married .
what else does it mean?
i wanna get married .
i've always wanted to get married .
if i can get married , it means i've changed i'm a new person .
how?
because who would want to marry me?
tim simms .
there is no tim simms .
i made him up .
in porpoise spit , no one would even look at me .
but when i came to sydney and became mariel , brice asked me out .
and that proves i'm already different than i was ... and if someone wants to marry me , i'm not her any more .
i'm me .
her?
muriel !
muriel heslop !
stupid , fat and useless !
i hate her !
i'm not going back to being her again !
why can't it be me?
why can't i be the one?
have you been in a coma?
rhonda?
dad .
if they have a copy of this document , then the option is ... giving you a doctor's certificate saying you are unfit to testify .
can i have that title deed , paul?
that's the one .
we can only assume that victor keinosuke has given them a copy of this deed .
muriel , why'd you do it to me?
i gave you money .
i got you jobs .
i put her through this secretarial course . $2, 000 for two years , it cost me .
comes out , she can't even type .
i get her into selling cosmetics .
we all think she's making a go of it .
turns out she's robbin 'us blind .
you're a disgrace , an absolute disgrace !
a are you bill the battler?
i saw you on tv .
can i please have your autograph?
me and my dad think that you're not guilty , bill .
i've changed my name to mariel .
good on you , son .
you spread it around .
you can't stop progress !
you're comin 'back to porpoise spit with me .
we'll leave in three weeks , once this inquiry crap's over .
i can't go back .
i'm a new person .
you're a thief .
the only reason i never got the coppers onto you is your mother begged me not to .
i want that money back .
i'll get you a job at the leagues club .
i'll arrange a bank loan for you .
you're going to make up for what you've done , muriel .
it's deidre chambers .
deidre !
deidre !
hey , deidre !
bill !
what a coincidence !
what are you doing in sydney?
well , my sister lives in sydney .
i'm down for the long weekend .
pull up a chair .
what a coincidence !
my barrister , graham newman .
his two solicitors , and muriel you know about .
hello .
it's mariel !
we should get back , bill .
victor keinosuke's testimony starts at 3 : 00 .
that jap bastard !
he's gonna testify that i took bribes from him .
commissions .
commissions .
i took commissions .
cut through all that red tape for him .
i deserve some sort of acknowledgement .
they'd never have got to build that resort on crown land without me .
it was the crown land that did it .
total overreaction .
there were aboriginals living on it .
the federal police raided the house .
your mother just let them walk in .
she and perry made statements told them i had money problems .
don't think about it .
of course i had money problems .
she stole most of it .
you need your family around you .
if the feds come near you , don't you say a word .
are you and deidre together?
what?
have you left mum for deidre?
yes .
we're in love .
what about mum?
what happiness has your father had in his life if he doesn't have me?
what about mum?
she'll have you .
you got three weeks .
it's come back the tumour .
i have to have another operation .
i'm not gonna walk .
but what about your rehabilitation?
they're gonna cut my spinal cord , mariel .
mum called .
she wants to take me back to porpoise spit .
i told her i was gonna stay here with you .
head down !
head down !
come on !
come on !
swing it !
blokes with no legs and no arms cut through the water faster than that !
look at that !
you're going through there like a constipated duck !
look at 'em flopping around all over the place !
burchett , what do you think this is , synchronized swimming?
water aerobics for geriatrics?
you're supposed to be a sprinter !
go !
go !
go !
go !
mariel?
ken blundell .
how are ya?
van arkle !
i think we found you a girl .
david van arkle , mariel heslop .
mariel , you've probably seen the news about the civil war in south africa .
well , just as the south africans seem to be doing the right thing by the blacks ... the police open fire on a black soccer club , and that is bad news for david .
are you black?
what?
i don't know why i said that .
well , well , it is funny , in a way .
but let's be honest .
the south africans were never much chop in the pool anyway .
david here is a bit of a freak , really .
and i think that he is gonna get the gold medal ... for the 1, 500 metres in the next olympic games .
mariel , how did you feel when kieren perkins ... took gold for australia at barcelona?
who?
kieren perkins .
he's an australian champion .
now , david's family ... are willing to do anything to see him fulfil his potential as a champion ... even if it means swimming for another country .
and they're willing to pay $10, 000 ... to the girl that'll help dave out .
are you from sydney originally?
what?
no , porpoise spit .
a and why did you leave there?
well , because of all the mental things that happened to me .
i got shallow , and my physical being could have been improved ... and as well as my mentality .
what about the black haired one?
no , she was turkish .
she's only been in the country five minutes .
now , whoever marries david will have to ... tell the immigration authorities that they're in love with him .
now there'll be media attention ... so they'll have to live with david in his flat ... for at least four months after the marriage .
i've worked out all the details of the romance ... which you and david will have to stick to .
but the most important thing is to convince people ... that you two are really in love .
what about the blonde?
you didn't like her .
i'm not so sure now .
now , i think mariel might be ... just what we're looking for .
well , it's up to you now , love .
would you find it difficult to lie?
i could try .
well , don't rush your decision ... but if you could let us know by tomorrow morning .
you can dance , you can jive
having the time of your life
ooh , see that girl watch that scene
diggin 'the dancing queen
i know you couldn't have got up onto the altar , but at least she could have asked you to be bridesmaid .
she did .
why didn't you say yes?
you could have been on television .
i don't want to sit up here , mum .
i wanna sit in the corner .
no one'll see you over there .
well , if this is your attitude , i don't know why you bothered coming .
at least you won't be in anyone's way .
rhonda?
is that you?
you're the bridesmaids?
isn't it fantastic?
we always knew mariel'd come good .
she's in all the papers .
what happened to you?
i had cancer .
it's all right .
they cut it out .
i won't walk again though .
you were so full of life .
i'm not dead , cheryl .
come on .
we better get ready .
mariel's coming .
you must be so happy for her .
god , she has cancer !
i'm divorcing chook .
i suppose i have you to thank for that .
i hope i can do the same for you one day .
you told me it would be a quick civil ceremony .
ah , it's good she wanted a church wedding .
it's romantic .
it looks like you mean it .
all the guests are on her side .
i should have hired you some friends .
the charges don't surprise me .
the bastards have been out to get me from the beginnin '.
i just wanted you to know
mariel , are you marrying david for money?
is this a marriage of convenience , mariel?
mariel , how long have you and david
your mum's arriving in sydney by bus because i can't afford a plane ticket .
you see what you've done to me?
where is she now?
i don't know .
trying to get a taxi , i suppose .
mariel .
you're beautiful .
love me or leave me
make your choice , but believe me
i love you
i do , i do , i do , i do , i do
i can't conceal it
don't you see can't you feel it
don't you too
i do , i do , i do , i do , i do
oh , i've been dreaming
through my lonely past
now i just made it
i've found you at last
so come on now let's try it
i love you , you can't deny it
'cause it's true oh , god .
don't panic .
think of the games .
i do , i do , i do , i do , i do
she's all yours , mate .
father , when you created mankind , you willed that man and wife should be one .
join david and muriel  mariel .
mariel in the loving union of marriage ... so that they may be living witness to your divine love in the world .
david , do you take mariel to be your wife?
do you promise to be true to her in good times and in bad ... in sickness and in health to love and honour her all the days of your life?
uh , yeah .
okay .
all right .
why not?
i do .
mariel , do you take david to be your husband?
do you promise to be true to him in good times and in bad ... in sickness and in health to love and honour him all the days of your life?
i do .
you have declared your consent before the church .
may the lord strengthen that consent and fill you with his blessings .
what god has joined , men must not divide .
mariel , take this ring as a sign of my , uh
love and fidelity .
love and fidelity .
in the name of the father  in the name of the father , son and the holy spirit .
david , i take this ring as a sign of your love and fidelity ... in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit .
i now pronounce you man and wife .

he's fighting fit .
the next gold you'll see on this hand will be the gold medal for the 1, 500 metres !
you reckon?
oh , yes .
mariel and us have been friends for years .
we went to hibiscus island together .
we're like sisters .
she's my best friend .
i i tell her everything .
mariel !
oh , you look beautiful !
oh , isn't she beautiful?
she is wearing the make up , isn't she?
smile .
i was tryin 'to hide from you .
i saw your wheels .
i didn't think you'd come .
i had to see it for myself .
just the bridesmaids were worth it .
i didn't call them .
they came crawling back to me .
the way they picked on me in porpoise spit ... saying i wouldn't amount to anything
and here i am , famous , and they're at my wedding .
i showed them .
showed them what?
i'm as good as they are .
i have to go .
good luck with what's his name .
where are you going?
where do you think?
back to porpoise spit with mum .
we're catching the bus out tonight .
i don't want you to .
well , you should have thought of that before you gave up on me .
i couldn't pay all the rent without you .
i couldn't even do the shopping .
i needed help .
i needed a friend .
i mean , i don't want you to go back by bus .
i bought you two plane tickets .
go to hell .
i already gave 'em to your mum .
you're right .
you are a new person , and you stink .
mariel van arkle stinks !
and she's not half the person muriel heslop was .
rhonda , your mum just told us you're moving back to porpoise spit .
it'll be just like old times .
don't worry about rhonda , mrs e.
we'll push her around .
are you rich?
my parents own it .

they're in johannesburg .
kitchen , lounge room , gym .
you can use everything but the weights .
bathroom , my room .

i'm going downstairs for a swim .

me too .
$84 . 20 . $84 . 20 .

mariel van arkle speaking .
hello?

we're all at the hospital .
dad says you have to come home .

russell's gonna be there .
yeah .
i invited him .
he says he's gonna bring alan .
hi .
hi .
mariel?
is that you?
not sure .
it was a heart attack .
joanie found her .
she was lying on the bed , looking peaceful .
she didn't suffer .
she made the ultimate sacrifice for your father .
judge will be lenient on him now .
he's got kids to support .
she'd be glad , in the end , her life amounted to something .
deidre , i finished up in the bathroom .
you were right about those cupboards .
let's start on the laundry then .
it's a big job .
what happened?
mum burnt it .
why?
because she got sick and tired of waiting for perry to mow it .
hi .
what am i gonna do without her?
her photo album .
she took pills sleeping pills .
they were next to her when i found her .
and when dr farrell come , they were gone .
and when i asked what happened to 'em ...
dad said he didn't want anyone to know .
dr farrell said dad had been through enough .
i don't know .
maybe he has .
the lord is good to me
his word my hope
secures
he will my shield
and portion be
as long as life
endures
i have a telefax to read .
keep your eye on them journalist bastards .
to bill heslop and family ...
hazel and i were sorry to hear of the passing of betty .
we are thinking of you in your time of sorrow .
signed , the honourable bob hawke ... former prime minister of australia .
what are they doin '?
they're , they're writin 'it down .
i'll bet they are .
put that in your papers , you mongrel bastards .
i've still got friends .
how many families get telegrams from former prime ministers ... when somebody dies?
i'm not forgotten .
betty heslop lived for her family .
she was very happy about her daughter mariel's marriage ... and attending the wedding in sydney ... was one of the highlights of her life .
her life , during her last days on earth ... made me think of
mariel .
i'm sorry .
i thought i was so different a new person .
but i'm not .
i'm just the same as him .
heslop .
on the beach motel .
one .
i can't stay married to you , david .
i've got to stop lying now .
i tell so many lies .
one day i won't know i'm doing it .
i don't love you .
i i don't love you either , but , uh
i don't know .
i i think i could like having you around .
i'll give you the money back .
it's yours .
good luck in the games .
you too .
i don't understand it .
why'd she burn the back yard?
we've got to stick together .
you've got to help me with the kids .
what about deidre?
she'll lend a hand .
i don't think she's keen to marry me ... now that livin 'with the kids has come into it .
someone's got to look after them .
and it has to be you , dad .
you owe me , muriel .
now , this isn't all of it ... but i'll pay the rest off when i get back to sydney and get a job .
so you're not gonna help me out .
is that it?
you owe us , dad .
we're not useless .
we never were .
now you're looking after the kids ... and you're gonna tell them they're not useless .
how about that telegram from bob hawke?
how'd you get that?
i phoned his office .
i was nearly in the state government .
fourteen votes i needed .
nobody knew who'd won for three days till the postal vote came in .
for three days , i was almost there .
couldn't win a chook raffle now .
resigned from the council .
i'm unemployed .
got to go on the dole .
imagine the faces when i walk into that dole office .
you reap what you sow .
you'd think i'd have learned that growin 'up on a farm .
you reap what you sow .
dad , the cricket's started .
hi , joan .
muriel's goin 'back to sydney .
are ya?
i thought you were stayin 'here with us .
keep in touch .
bye , dad .
do you want me to open you a can of beer?
that would be lovely , joanie .
with you in a sec .
i'm giving it another chance with chook as soon as he gets out of the correction centre .
they've accused him of raping a japanese tourist , which is ridiculous !
chook hates the japanese .
we better fly .
we're meeting rose biggs for lunch .
rose biggs?
are you friends with her?
once we got to know her , we found out she was just like us .
but rose biggs sucked your husband's cock .
rhonda !
oh , she did .
i know .
but w
i sucked her husband's cock , and it made me realize ... we all make mistakes .
hi .
mariel .
muriel .
what a surprise !
rhonda , mariel muriel's come to visit you .
actually , i've come to ask rhonda if she wants to come back to sydney .
i've got a taxi outside and two plane tickets , if you want to .
what about your husband?
we broke up .
i knew it wouldn't last .
what makes you think i'd go anywhere with you?
because i'm your friend .
muriel , you can't come bargin 'in here without warning ... trying to turn rhonda against the people who love her against the people who were there for her when she needed them .
yes , she can .
sorry , mum .
you know i love you , but you drive me crazy .

can you hear the drums , fernando
i remember long ago another starry night like this
in the firelight , fernando
you were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
i could hear the distant drums and sounds of bugle calls
were coming from afar
they were closer now , fernando
every hour , every minute seemed to last eternally
i was so afraid , fernando
we were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
and i'm not ashamed to say the roar of guns and cannons
almost made me cry
there was something in the air that night
the stars were bright , fernando
they were shining there for you and me
for liberty , fernando
though we never thought that we could lose
there's no regret
if i had to do the same again
i would , my friend , fernando
if i had to do the same again
i would , my friend , fernando
