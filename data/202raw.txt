what is the meaning of this check?
do you want me to cheat?
no , i'm just the middleman .
are you trying to use me so you can get ahead when i fall .
look at this !
i'm the one and only golden leg !
you can only dream about that .
no ... i don't .
i just want some kickback .
please don't tell anyone .
you're trash !
i'm sorry .
i'll see you later .
golden leg !
golden leg ...
golden leg ...
golden leg ...
hung , you've been a star player for twenty years , ever since fung missed the penalty kick and lost his golden leg ,
you've never had any rivals .
now that ...
oh no !
don't talk about such things !
hung , your evil team has won the gold for 5 years running .
what's your secret?
secret?
the secret is having a great soccer coach .
so , are you confident of winning gold again?
are you a new reporter?
i don't think you should ask this kind of question .
excuse me ...
good morning , hung !
golden leg !
good morning , hung !
good morning !
hung , your shoe is dirty .
i'll help you clean it up .
it's fine .
i can manage .
hung , i'll take your car over .
hung , you promised to offer a coaching job to me .
i'm ready .
i'm confident i can train a team as good as the evil team .
do you think you still can be a coach?
forget it .
but you said ...
get real .
don't you see?
you're a cripple now .
do you think you still can depend on that tattoo?
hung , i've served you for 20 years .
how can you say such things .
today , i'm not in the mood .
things change .
you looked great when you were young .
you see , you're just like my dog now .
forget it .
got lost .
i've already taken care of you for 20 years now .
you know , you've cost me a lot of money .
hung ! you're too vain !
if you hadn't given me that kick back check 20 years ago ...
i wouldn't be crippled now .
what?
getting angry?
yell louder !
hey !
you guys hear that?
thousands of reporters outside .
should i invite them in?
you know ...
i keep you here to keep you quiet .
would anyone believe a crippled beggar like you?
you !
don't be angry .
if you want to blame anyone , blame yourself .
blame your own greediness .
forget it .
i'll tell you another thing .
i was the one that arranged the accident to your leg .
damn it !
that's no way to kick a ball .
pardon?
i said that's no way to kick a ball .
so what's your opinion?
there has to be a fusion of the strength from the waist to the foot .
what's that " from the waist to the foot "?
yes , from the waist to the foot .
my idol bruce lee has already spoken on the subject .
if you want to learn more , you can take two kung fu lessons from me .
learn kung fu from you?
you just look like a cleaner .
cleaner is just my job .
my real identity is a postgraduate student .
postgraduate student?
studying how to effectively develop shaolin kung fu .
here's my business card .
shaolin orthodox school mighty stal leg .
look !
it's really strong .
fighting is not my style .
i'm an well educated man .
you're wrong .
do you see that girl?
i know she's sexy , so what?
but i'm an educated ...
no , no , no , no .
watch it ... watch it ... watch it ... watch it ... watch it ...
if she had learned shaolin kung fu , weight vest , she would not have fallen like that .
you see !
so shaolin kung fu is great !
hey !
do you want to learn kung fu?
you're crazy !
look at the woman over there .
if she had studied shaolin fung fu , iron hand , parking would be much easier .
so kung fu is wonderful !
excuse me !
do you want to learn ...
okay ... get lost you !
you should share the money with me .
don't ruin our new friendship !
look at that !
what's wrong?
you've already spent a whole year to trim the tree .
you're fired .
get away !
i'm sorry ...
get away !
if he had studied shaolin kung fu , nine fence of the recluse , he would not be in trouble !
i think nine fence of the recluse came from hua shan .
don't you know all kung fu styles originated from shaolin?
kung fu is absolutely good for different ages .
brutality is just the wrong impression of kung fu .
kung fu is an art ,
one kind of indomitable spirit .
i'm looking for a good way to package shaolin kung fu ... to let people understand its true meaning .
enough , already !
i've not finished yet .
almost finished .
i still have some appointments with my clients .
we're done .
please seize your opportunity !
the lame can also learn kung fu .
what are you talking about?
who's the lame?
you're not qualified to talk soccer with me .
i'm sorry !
yes , i'm lame , but it's none of your business .
the lame?
bullshit !
what ... what?
you scaring me?
do you still want the garbage?
if you don't , i'll call the other one .
i'm coming over .
hurry up !
get out of here ...
excuse me !
would you help me put it over there?
no problem !
your leg is so great !
twenty cents !
oh , no !
just twenty cents?
there are some cups and plates inside .
would you give me ten more cents?
wah , move it over there .
mui , please give me ten steamed breads !
using tai chi kung fu to make steamed bread is a startling idea .
the steamed bread looks sweet and tasty .
i'm so impressed by her strong arms .
you ...
what are you doing?
singing is the proper way for me to express my true feelings of esteem .
wow !
so beautiful !
i'm not beautiful .
don't laugh at me !
you see !
the steamed bread is so great !
tastes wonderful !
your tai chi kung fu , shifting bodies and transposing shadows ...
it's a firm but gentle kung fu , shove a thousand cattle with four tales .
well !
that's why the steamed bread is so tender and firm .
fifty cents each .
two steamed breads is one dollar .
so expensive .
really .
even though it's so expensive , it's worth it .
i just have fifty cents right now .
may i pay you in 2 days?
ok .
well !
you're a typical kung fu master , speaking with grace and ease .
you know , we are both shaolin masters .
would you give me a face saving permission?
yes .
okay !
these valuable sneakers originally cost 2 dollars .
now , i'll let you have them cheap .
one dollar fifty cents , and i'll take one steamed bread more .
call the police !
okay !
why don't you give me permission?
ah !
you're so beautiful ...
shut up !
stop singing , please .
put down your money and get away right now .
if you like singing , you should go up to that mountain .
only crazy people sing up here .
i don't agree with this girl .
it's not crazy for anyone to sing here .
this is exploding .
i'll never give up my dream ... ... of becoming a composer .
this gentleman's song is ... ... so creative and full of enthusiasm .
thank you !
you're welcome .
his song has touched me deeply and draws out my enthusiasm .
at this moment , i've a feeling that ...
i should explode .
even if i'm just a butcher , i can also dream of being a dancer .
great !
have you guys got nothing to do right now?
stand straight !
put your hands down !
stretch your neck !
you're nuts !
you can't dance here .
really?
i just went out to do my facial .
i couldn't imagine that you had already made a mess here .
why did this crazy guy come here?
you're so ferocious , shouting at everyone .
i came here to buy streamed bread .
is my steamed bread ready?
coming !
wait a minute !
did the guy pay for the steamed bread?
he did .
what's this dirty stuff?
throw it away !
first big brother !
first big brother !
it's okay !
keep working .
clean it up , please !
are you sick , first big brother?
i've a headache .
i got drunk last night .
anyway , what do you want?
i want to let you know i awakened already .
truly?
you awakened .
i awakened .
i finally understood .
if i want to develop shaolin kung fu for the world ,
i need to package it in a new form .
what kind of form?
singing !
you won't believe what i saw today .
i saw a steamed bread shop ...
stop bothering me !
but , what do you think if i combine shaolin kung fu ... with singing and dancing?
forget it .
how will you know until you try it?
forget it !
i already told you to quit dreaming .
there's a toilet cleaning job .
you should take it ... and quit dreaming .
if we don't have dreams in life , we'll look like a salt fish .
you see , you're a real salt fish without a pair of shoes !
how can you talk about a dream?
oh , no !
the fire in my heart is not easy to put out !
why not?
just blow it out !
but i can light it up again !
enough , already !
we have our own separate lives .
stop bothering me !
i work to support my family .
you mean you are willing to give up your iron head?
did you forget how long you trained for it?
you're wrong !
i didn't give it up ... for even one day !
fei !
boss !
damn it !
the dancers quit the show already .
how can you stay here and do nothing about it?
no !
i have a great idea .
what's that?
combining shaolin kung fu with singing and dancing .
what kind of shaolin kung fu?
look at this .
it's no good for a show .
he's good enough .
no !
how about you?
me?
shit !
how about your iron head?
if you don't do it well , i'll kill you tomorrow .

what are you singing about?
your voice sound like howling .
the lyric is disgusting .
i even can't understand one sentence of this .
yes , of course .
who wrote this lyric?
who did?
who did?
creative work is highly subjective , but i must answer your criticism .
singing is just the beginning of the show .
the highlight is the performance of mighty stal leg and iron head !
iron head?
i had already told you that you wrote the bad lyric .
i'm not iron head .
he's ...
lron head?
i said ...
lron head?
mighty stal leg !

happy hour is going fast .
it's time for us to say good bye right now .
let's listen to music !
you crazy guys !
let's see if you can take more !
thank you !
bullshit !
what?
go !
nothing interested !
do you still want to fight with us?
i promised my shaolin master i wouldn't use kung fu to fight with anyone .
this guy is crazy .
but all you guys should apologize !
apologize?
i shouldn't have to . . it's all you guys fault !
don't move !
you said you wouldn't use kung fu to hit anyone .
i'm not coming for fighting .
i'm coming to play soccer .
shit !
you don't need to be so exaggerated !
what?
i'm so sorry !
do you have some money right now?
yes .
thirty cents .
are you grabbing my money?
yep .
did you learn tong long fist?
i did .
don't insult shaolin kung fu anymore !
ok .
would you let me take a look at your leg?
i'm not in the mood .

it's the real , original kung fu .
a great killer slim leg .
it's shaolin mighty stal leg !
is it possible to use kung fu to play soccer?
truly use kung fu?
yes , of course !
yeah !
it's a great idea to use kung fu to play soccer .
why didn't i ever think about that?
are you the lame?
i'm not just the lame .
i'm the ex soccer player , golden leg .
now , i'm a soccer coach .
that's great !
you should teach me to play soccer .
hold on .
no !
you told me i could use kung fu to play soccer .
but i need time to consider !
i've no time to think anymore !
it's sunset already !
time doesn't wait for anyone !
but we still need to prepare !
i'm ready !
what do i need?
at least a pair of shoes !
do you have money to get your sneakers back?
no .
but ...
i threw them away .
oh , my god !
your sneakers were worn out and broken .
yes , they were broken .
but i ...

my boss will yell at you if she comes back and sees you .
i can't get the broken ones back .
there is a repaired pair .
do you want to have it?
first big brother , what are you doing?
first big brother , are you okay?
i'm fine .
what do you want?
i finally got a good idea ... to promote shaolin kung fu .
this is for playing soccer !
please let me go !
you had already got me into trouble .
i was fired .
now , i work in the rest room to pay for my boss's loss .
so i come here to help you .
no !
absolutely not !
if you force me anymore , my whole family will commit suicide in front of you .
committing suicide is not a good way to solve any problems .
be brave !
don't be so silly !
i'm such a loser !
please don't come here anymore !
if you still want to form a soccer team , you can call the other brothers .
please , don't bother me !
i beg you !
lron head .
good morning , fourth big brother !
good morning , sing !
how are you?
let me introduce a great guy to you !
he's ...
nice to meet you !
i am fung .
i know , fung is so famous in the stock exchange market .
you see !
he has a great i. t. look .
fung is a soccer coach .
soccer coach !
everyone knows that fung is the most ... famous figure in the soccer field .
do you use your legs to play soccer?
you see !
i'm right .
actually , do you have any job?
i want you to join into my soccer team?
playing soccer?
i've no job for six months .
how can you ask me to play soccer?
if you can use your empty hand ...
what's empty hand?
that was a long time ago .
you know , i even forgot when our master died .
please listen to me !
we're going to sign up the national soccer tournament .
the prize is one million dollars .
really?
so i say you're the smartest one .
you see !
you're dressed up .
many years ago , our master ordered us to develop shaolin kung fu .
now , you guys get this great idea of using shaolin kung fu to play soccer
you see !
this's the group picture of our master and brothers .
i always keep it under my pillow .
you should know what i mean .
great !
let's sit down to talk about what you mean .
i'll call you if i've time .
remember , please save a place for me .
no time to talk now .
some clients waiting for me .
i should keep my eyes on the stock market .
my trades are for hundreds of thousands each .
hello?
what's the price now?
today , my driver's off .
i just lent my car to my friend , and i left my wallet in my office .
i'm sorry !
no time for lunch with you guys .
i'm too busy .
get away from me !
third big brother , think about it !
if you can use iron shirt to be the back ...
what's lron shirt?
you see !
there are planes in the sky .
there are computers on the street .
it's the 21st century .
stop living in a dreamworld !
but i think it's a good idea to combine kung fu with soccer .
it's true !
and there's a large prize .
for christ sake !
you think i'm ...
my trades are hundreds of thousand dollars each .
there's no way i'll give up trading to play soccer .
i'm sorry .
you know , i'm so direct ...
it's impossible to give up my trading and sign up to play soccer with you guys .
forgive me .
i'm an honest guy .
finally , it's also impossible for me to win a fucking soccer game .
truly , the probability of winning is 0 % .
probabil ...
probability !
okay ...
it will be heads , or it will be tails .
it'll never stand on end .
so the probability is 0 % .
let me try .
get away !
i've an appointment with my client at a coffee shop .
get away !
we can have a quick noodle lunch at a stall .
bullshit !
my trades are for hundreds of thousands dollars each .
how can i go eat noodles with you guys?
he's my sixth small brother , weight vest .
this is the famous soccer coach , fung .
fung , how are you?
what vest?
weight vest
nice to meet you !
mr. vest .
fifth big brother , are you thinking about playing soccer?
yes , if you can use shaolin kung fu , you can play forward with me .
our attack should be flawless .
are you sure about this?
of course .
great !
do you have any diet pills?
it's hopeless .
since the virus get into the cerebellum , there's no way for me to lose any pounds .
after i became like this , i'm unable to use shaolin kung fu weight vest , or even to walk quickly .
yes , you're a little bit fat , but it's not so important .
forget it !
you see , it was my picture !
since i've become like this ,
i even can't date a girl .
you can't understand that .
i do .
i also can't date a girl !
really?
there has been much gossip about your girls in the papers .
what papers?
oh !
i'm sorry !
since i've this disease , i can't control myself .
i'm sorry .
please leave me alone !
small brother !
you should have confidence !
you can do it !
now , everyone calls me lazy pig ...
you know , you're the only one who calls me small brother .
thank you !
lazy pig , please help me to get the red package of tissue .
the red one !
playing soccer?
yes , second big brother !
if you can use hooking leg to be the back ,
our defense will be flawless !
absolutely
don't you think i still can use hooking leg?
you just need some practice .
if you trust yourself , you will get your hooking leg back .
really?
i just saw you collecting excrement and urine recently .
why did you change your job to washing dishes?
why?
why do you care?
i don't understand , either .
why isn't my dad the richest guy , lee ka sing?
why am i going bald , even though i'm so handsome?
you guys are not going bald , but you're so ugly .
why could the other guys go to school when they were young ,
but i was forced to study the shaolin kung fu , and then become a dish washer , or collect urine and excrement?
calm down , second big brother !
if you have courage , you can control your fate .
calm down?
if i didn't calm down ,
i would kill you guys !
calm down?
why are you just sitting there?
didn't you smell anything disgusting?
if it stinks when i come back , you'll clean it with your tongue !
your apartment is great !
it's well furnished .
i can't imagine you work as the cleaner downstairs , but live in the penthouse on the 59th floor .
you've good taste !
this kind of apartment is so popular .
i can't even get one .
this place is okay .
just little bit noisy .
would you mind if i move here?
forget it !
your brothers are not good .
we can find some others to join our team .
it was all my fault .
i couldn't persuade them .
it's okay .
you know , i'm so glad that you trust me .
thank you .
we'll have a short training period to teach you ... to be professional soccer players .
so you should be serious and mutually support each other .
i understand !
let's go !
please listen to me !
what would you do if you were in my position?
yes , of course .
i've a call .
hold on a second .
the ball is coming back down !
what are you doing?
playing soccer !
the ball is over there !
the ball is over here .
let me see you kick the ball here .
the ball is over there .
yes , over there !
you can't even get the ball .
how can you kick it from here?
pass , stop , hold and kick .
i understand !
don't move !
okay .
start from the beginning .
yours .
hold it .
watch out !
concentrate !
concentrate !
come on !
move !
yes ... you need more cone work .
almost fine .
it's great training .
do more work with the cones .
fung , why can't i take part in the training?
even though your leg is so strong , you can't control it well
what if you kick the ball into the sky ... and then hit a plane?
can you pay for it?
no .
so ...
sixth small brother !
i'm borrowing your eggs !
what?
if you can control the egg well in the air , you can play soccer .
no problem !
okay !
go ahead .
it's not easy .
sixth small brother , forget it !
oh , my god !
my egg !
i'll replace it later !
no way !
give it back to me !
concentrate ...
my egg !
yes !
yes !
yes !
yes !
yours !
right ...
good ...
yes !
go !
mark that one !
watch out !
how can you let him kick the ball?
kick it !
come on !
it's great !
he can just play it by himself .
no !
it's teamwork .
there's no way just for one to play soccer .
each half is 30 minutes .
there is no break .
we'll follow the international rules .
i'm the referee .
do you have any questions?
don't be silly?
you know , how great golden leg is as referee ... and he leads a young soccer team to play with us .
we are very happy about that !
this's fung ! fung !
okay .
enough .
this guy has some problems with your team's players .
now , this game is an exchange of our skills of playing soccer .
it is used to solve this conflict .
you see !
they play sincerely .
from their tidy uniform and friendly face ,
i can deeply feel their sincerity and the spirit of physical culture .
thank you !
calm down .
i'm an auto mechanic .
this crescent wrench is used for turning bolts .
does that make any sense?
yes , of course .
i explained it already .
because i'm a car repairer , it's all right for me to have a hammer .
okay .
your team's style ... is very famous in the amateur soccer world .
i understand .
it's an undeserved reputation .
seems the clouds in the sky ...
okay .
anyway , take care of yourselves .
shake hands , please !
great !
help !
third big brother !
call the military base , we've just suffered a fierce attack .
ask for reinforcements !
ask for reinforcements !
stand up .
stand up !
stand up quickly !
stand up quickly !
what are you doing?
coach , they are lawless .
why don't you stop them?
i'm the referee .
i don't have to stop them .
why not?
do you want us to lose?
you !
out !
are you nuts?
this is a test .
if you guys can't pass it , then we don't deserve to win !
it's only a game .
we're not fighting a war .
soccer really is like war .
i surrender !
i surrender !
i surrender !
i surrender !
i surrender !
if you wanted me to play , why did you surrender?
do you play to lose?
i can't stand it anymore .
my bone seems broken .
i'm a pitiful creature !
please let me go to see a doctor !
put it on your head !
you see .
you look like a dog .
have you no self respect?
i don't want to see you .
put it on your head and go see a doctor .
yes , i'm a dog .
i don't have any self respect .
first big brother is coming back .
what?
i've a feeling that they're back .
do we still have any weapons?
none !
the final attack !
oh , my god !
i couldn't get it .
help !
