like a wonderful moment you've come into my life
wonder what world you come from
you remind me of the forgotten past
you have taken over my very being
like a wonderful moment you've come into my life
are you for real?
or an illusion?
you remind me of the forgotten past
you have invaded my very being
i'm still the same , so is the moment
yet , never was this frenzy before
your heartbeat is fragrant
i'm lost in your love
like a wonderful moment you've come into my life
wonder what world you come from
you remind me of the forgotten past
you have invaded my very being
john would laugh when i used to write my diary .
he'd say ... the past is meant to be forgotten , not to be remembered
how can i forget the days i spent with him?
i loved him dearly ... though i knew he was a contract killer
i wish he hadn't picked up the gun for the first time , then perhaps ... !
thus john was sucked into the vicious circle of crime
i'm not the only one eyeing this 500 acre land .
yunus too is
only a politician can do this job
i trusted trivedi , and ...
lf he doesn't agree?
well ... if he doesn't , i'll spare him
why , you don't trust me?
trust you?
i do
greetings , captain
mr trivedi , i'm angry with you .
why?
javed is threatening my people .
he got my dealers ... in malaysia and hong kong bumped off
and you are joining hands with him .
so unfair , trivedi
you are my friend , aren't you?
of course ...
i'm your friend , captain .
you are right
good you asked me .
i know
hope you don't intend to severe ties?
oh no
well , i don't recognise you .
i'm sorry
my son .
john .
strange , captain
you never told me you had a family .
who told you that?
lsn't this my family?
lsn't farid family?
well , i didn't call you over to introduce you to my family ... but to ask you about the land deal
you see ... that land is disputed
we've bought many such plots from you , did you encounter any problem?
this time too , you won't .
i'll pay the full amount right away
farid , advance !
oh no .
listen to me , captain
it's not a matter of money .
please try to understand
give me some time .
ls it that yunus is vying ...?
no , not yunus
javed .
i see
javed is full bloodedly seeking that land
forgive me , captain , but i think i won't be able to help you
shit !
ls there any thing else i can do?
oh , mr trivedi ... what else?
you failed to deliver
do this little job for me .
tell me , i'll do it right away
i wanted some fodder for the fish
where do you want it from?
from?
you have it
just a little ...
what are you upto ...?
captain , you're insane !
see , john?
people have such strange hobbies
fishing is my hobby , being the bait is his
i dropped several hints , but he didn't agree
i guess javed too shares his hobby
he's going to singapore tomorrow , to meet anna
he won't
bull ... here's a riddle .
two gates in a zoo , one bigger than the other
a deer walks out of the small gate and gets in from the bigger one .
why?
the small gate is probably shut after he leaves
no
maybe the gate's height ...?
when he returns ... he sees a wild animal at the gate , a lion perhaps ...
no .
pass .
tell us john
it's the deer's wish .
he can come and go anywhere he wants
shit !
bullshit
can't find it !
what?
film ticket ... gotcha
it's a sushmita sen movie .
my sushmita
which show?
first show obviously , stupid
first show?
are you crazy?
how will you get there?
what's the big deal?
enter an empty house , wait a while , boss will play golf , and soon we leave
simple
aishwarya !
i love aishwarya !
what a body , what a face !
so my little bulbul , why don't you profess your love?
i had the idea .
then i thought if she marries me ... the film industry will be ruined .
i can't bear to see others in pain
let's go
i will buy nice nice toys and chocolates for my daughters
did you enjoy the holidays?
yes
i think she's crying , papa diya ...
she's crying
i think you should give her all the toys , papa
what will you have then?
it's okay
wow !
so handsome
hat , kaif
cannon , kaif
gun ... two guns
i'll open the lift door .
no , i will
so javed is going to singapore today !
singapore called off
he's going straight to heaven .
yunus will receive a great shock
shock?
he'll die of shock
you don't look like a bull in any way .
who christened you bull , and why?
ask my pop after you die .
okay?
bulbul is an apt name boss gave you .
enough of jokes
shall i take the shot , john?
will you?
javed will be on target only for five seconds . lf you miss ...
my aim's not that bad , okay?
diya , come on ...
move !
uncle ...
come on , john ... we must leave
c'mon , john !
c'mon , forgive me now , kaif .
what's wrong with you?
i'm fine
bumped off four others along with javed , eh?
one for one free scheme !
but you'll be paid only for one
it was written that the house was empty
true .
the family was supposed to arrive next week ... but turned up suddenly .
so?
which means you knew about it .
my mistake
shall i shoot ...?
and say i goofed?
forget it , john .
let him go
never make this mistake again
before i do , get out !
i'm sorry to hear about javed ...
enough .
captain made a mistake
he's done wrong , yunus bhai
i can't take it anymore . lnitially he asked for a share in the business
and now he demands money in the drug deals
though it was peanuts , we still used get a share before
not the same anymore .
when bhatia and kapoor demanded their share ... he said the consignment was seized .
it's not in the police records
yunus bhai , you must avenge javed's death
all of us stand to gain with captain's death
and kapoor?
what does he say?
he wouldn't come here to face verma
well , i spoke to him at the golf club .
he also wants captain dead
captain's done me a lot of favours
looks like it's time to repay ... the debt
this way , sir
take everyone's statements , be warm .
and seal off the area
i will
how long have you known him?
good god !
he was a major , sir .
nagesh thakur
they were away on a month's holiday , supposed to return next week ...
came back early to attend someone's wedding
who was at home?
major nagesh ... his wife and a little kid
two kids
d'you have chocolates?
no , sir
nice doll
i have a doll too , see
why don't we exchange our dolls?
don't worry , my child ... no problem .
look ...
i'll keep it here .
her name is diya
know what?
i got a little daughter , just like you
d'you know her name?
her name's piya .
look , i got her picture
look
who's sweeter?
you tell me
you?
or piya?
take
great job , sir !
that evening when john came to pick me up ...
i knew from his eyes that something had gone wrong
every heart has a desire
one just needs to realise
every little element ...
appears to radiate
an unknown intoxication grips my heart
a fading dream flares up again
this feeling , this consolation ...
is this love?
this feeling , this consolation ... " " is this love ...? " " question my skipping heartbeats
every little element ...
appears to radiate
every heart has a desire
oh , for someone who'd realise
listen to me first .
there were so many idiots around
did you see the baldie sitting there?
over there
you saw him , didn't you?
guess what he did?
he fished out his visiting card , gave it to me and asked ...
d'you sing at private parties?
i denied it
he questioned me thrice , and thrice i denied it
then guess what i did?
i showed him the finger
his expression was worth watching .
he didn't know what to do
that's funny , john .
yeah
why aren't you smiling , dear?
are you all right?
i'm fine
i've taken leave till the 15th
why?
what do you mean why?
why would i take a leave?
you can't afford to stay there , didn't i tell you?
guess why i told you?
what's on the 15th?
i don't remember
you don't remember?
shalini , i don't remember anything tonight
don't you really know what's on this 15th?
i don't remember
sure?
on the 15th of this month is the 3rd anniversary of our first meeting
how could you forget that?
i'm sorry
that cute sorry deserves to be forgiven
nothing doing till the 15th .
you're not going away , neither am i
only you and me !
your favourite wine is inside the refrigerator
i've sent laxmi on leave too
we'll wine , dine and have fun , what say?
don't sit ...
i got to show you something
come here
see this bud , john?
should we water it everyday , it'll bloom ... on the 15th , on our anniversary
lsn't that romantic?
where are you lost?
did you have anything since morning?
please don't nod like that !
it reminds me of that manager
yes or no , say it clearly
actually , the poor guy whined today ... when i told him i won't sing till the 15th ... and if i do sing , it'll only be for my dear hubby
he said , " you'll get your salary minus 15, 000
can you imagine?
had he said no leave , then ...
please pass that rag , john
special coverage .
lndia's budget
when we'll have a house of our own ... we'll have plants on all sides .
lnside as well as outside
big windows ... cool breeze coming through , curtains flying ...
and the floor will be granite .
i cannot handle wood and all
breaking news
can you imagine ...? just you and me
on the beach ... by the deep blue waters ... huge waves ...
i can almost hear it
we're reporting from challenger building
this is the house of major thakur and his innocent family ... who were brutally murdered .
the police have no lead yet
what's wrong , honey?
lf not me , who else will you tell?
the only survivor is a seven year old innocent child diya ... who survived by hiding on top of an air conditioner
the police are investigating whether major thakur had any previous enmity
it was a simple plan
suddenly there was a noise
but i committed a mistake .
a grave mistake
out of the blue she appeared before me
the innocent child had no idea she was facing her death
ln just 30 seconds , the entire family ... !
the happy , cheerful family !
an ominous knell resonated in my ears
her hands were going cold
when i open my eyes ...
i see their faces
when i shut them ...
i hear them scream
shalini , please understand me
will you give me a hug?
please help us find them .
your names , addresses ... and all details will be kept secret
i'm sorry , shalini
i'm sorry
seeking forgiveness and forgiving ... won't make any difference
had you quit the job , this wouldn't have happened
we just have to move on
let's go away ... far away
captain wants to talk to you , mr yunus
yunus , did you get the flowers?
thank you very much , bro
thanks a million
i hear you after so long , i'm so unfortunate
and look at your good fortune , though for a short period ...
allah gives you a new lease of life
yunus , the flowers are not for javed ... it's meant for your coffin
oh , dear bro ... no emperor , no king , no prince survive
it's a misconception that you will stick to the throne , why?
give those tough bones some rest .
it's time for you to retire
yunus , i'll fix you and all those creeps ... who think that the captain's ship is sinking
and yes yunus , don't worry , you won't be lonely
i'll send over some friends for company
why can't we take everything along?
i can't leave like this , shalini
i'll going to tell the police everything
what do you think?
the police will let you go?
and suppose the police even let you off ... are they going to spare you?
had you been in my shoes ...
but i am in your shoes , john !
round the clock !
have you ever considered what i'm going through?
lf we run for it and something happens to you ...?
what if something happens to you?
let's be done with it
we're getting out of here in 15 minutes .
15 minutes !
we can then think with a calm mind .
please , john ...
sub lnspector naik here .
i want to talk to acp wagh
what is it regarding?
he's the one i'll tell
who's calling?
give him the phone
he's in a meeting with the commissioner .
any message?
let's leave now .
we can try later
there was an attack on the captain .
he's called you over
i'll come later
he wants you over right now .
i've been asked to bring you
you can talk it over with him .
hang on for a moment
i love you
on the seashore ... just you and me
before they're released , his funeral will be arranged
that's okay , but i have just one question
will the job really be done?
there should be no problem
you are talking to the captain himself !
are you okay?
yes
now look ; no more compromises , meetings or discussions .
only action
you're going to love it , john .
we've got to bump off yunus
not right away .
we've first got to eliminate the guys ... who're showing yunus dreams of becoming the captain
you're gonna love this job , john .
you're going to love it
that's okay .
kaif and bull will handle it
no .
you alone are going to do the job
kaif and bull will be around , but you'll have to pull it off
now don't tell me the idea of killing yunus scares you
no .
c'mon , son
as usual , let's shake hands
i'm quitting the racket
you're turning me down .
correct?
and what reason ...?
shalini and i ... are getting out of the city .
where will you go?
and do what?
get into farming?
graze cattle?
run a poultry farm?
what are you going to do?
don't be a romantic fool !
now look , john .
had you told me about this even two days ago ...
i'd have personally seen you off
but not today
i consider you to be my son , john
and now when the father's attacked , is the son going to show his back?
no way , no
i don't want any ...
sit down !
people are scared of you .
because you possess a gun
they're scared because you carry a gun , john
and people are scared of me because i have money , power ... and you
people who have nothing , go around begging for favours
and the others , people with power ... do as they please
they do anything goddamn thing they want to !
get those silly ideas out of your mind
c'mon ... come
this is the last time i'm shaking hands with you
we're not going to meet ever again
you will come back to me , john .
you really will
because the world outside isn't as romantic as you imagine it to be
john !
good luck
what could i do , if not turn him down?
i don't want this job anymore
you know , the captain doesn't like " no " for an answer
he'd better get used to it .
try and understand , john
you know what captain did to fakru for just a little thing ...
what's wrong with the car?
what are you upto?
who's fakru?
and what's with him?
it happened before you arrived
he refused the captain too .
the captain used his sword ... and fakru was beheaded .
that's the captain
the captain's not in the habit of taking " no " for an answer
i know what dangers lie ahead .
it's okay then
as soon as possible ...
that's what i'll do
mind if i say something?
it's just a matter of two days .
the captain will have a job done ... and there won't be any danger to you or shalini either
nobody's going to know .
me ...?
won't i get to know either?
i got to leave with shalini right now
just a minute .
i'm almost through
very lonely without shalini around in the house , isn't it?
what's she worth anyway?
you're so lucky
i thought she was all alone and so i called her over
shalini and i are going to spend the next two days together ... and say so much to each other
where's shalini?
i want to talk to shalini .
now ... this moment !
shut up !
captain !
where is shalini?
the poor girl doesn't even know that we have kidnapped her
john ... is that you?
hello ...
where are you?
are you okay?
the manager said there was some danger ... and you ... you even left your cell phone at home
where are you right now?
i'm just taking a precaution
i'm getting a friend of mine to make passports for us
i want you to remain there so you will not be in any kind of danger
are you telling me the truth?
trust me , shalini
i do .
where can i find you then?
don't worry about me
how am i not to worry?
you ought to have told me that i had to come here
listen ... will you do me a favour?
can you go home?
what for?
i think i forgot to switch off the geyser
okay
and listen ... if you're going home ... please water my plant .
it'll die if you don't water it
it will be taken care of .
you take care of yourself
where's my kiss ...?
ls everything all right?
i somehow don't like it
don't worry
nothing will happen to you
i love you .
i love you , too
bye , love .
bye
i give you my word bring those five guys here ... and take your sweetheart away
when you bump off one of them ... you'll get to talk to your sweetheart again .
deal?
lf something happens to my sweetheart ...
i will kill you
when , whom and how ... it's all explained in this
take my advise , bro .
don't ... your girl ...
i mean , it's too risky , bro
anything new?
i still say , let's do as captain says ..
speak up
where's shalini?
tell me , quick !
you're going to kill me ...?
shalini's also going to die then
captain , you've won the bet
this crazy guy's really come to save shalini
watch it , john
save this anger and obsession to kill those five guys
and don't waste any more time
before shalini's turned into fodder for the fish ... go away , my boy .
just go
try and remember something .
you've looked into his eyes
what were his eyes like?
we got no time to lose .
we must pull it off at the earliest
there's no way we can refuse ...
you needn't say that , bull
it's not an easy job , bro
any reckless step can increase the danger to sis in law
let's go through the plan
yunus lsmail .
holed up in a room on the top floor of his hotel
his guards , posing as staff , keeping vigil
the hotel's being watched round the clock
patil
the bloody cop .
go on
lnder kapoor .
national lndustries .
surrounded by guards ... shuttles between his factory and house in a bullet proof car
goes out to play golf occasionally
verma .
has taken a bullet earlier .
but eventually escaped
has his office right at home .
remains hidden like a rat
always surrounded by guards .
always
bhatia .
leads a life of luxury
has his work outs with the minister in his secure gym
guards , there too
goes jogging every morning .
has an office at nariman point
with tight security .
seems impossible
i got to make it possible .
where will be bhatia be right now?
nariman point
let's go
hurry up .
john , he'll get away .
hurry
the kid?
kid ...?
where's the kid , john?
there's no kid there
john , he's getting away !
what the hell are you doing , john?
that was the last chance !
we can now find bhatia only at his new babe's nightclub tonight
security is said to be tight there .
but i'm sure we'll manage it , john
i don't know how , but we'll do it
looks like orders from higher ups .
acp wagh is personally protecting him
and if john doesn't kill bhatia , captain's going to be offended
a little inconvenience for me would cause agony to john
that's something not just i knew .
captain knew it , too
yes , captain?
kaif?
ask your friend just how many more sins he's going to make me commit
well , never mind .
tell him that there's no time to lose .
you get that?
yes
good evening , sir .
how are you?
i'm fine , thank you
officer , there's no need for the police in there
we have enough security , please
no suspicious character would even dream of getting in there
don't worry , sir .
but i can't take chances
to love , you dance !
every sorrow , it turns into a song ... " " the heartstrings , it plays on ...
hide as i try to ...
love makes me dance
a high , it's a high !
a wave of colours unknown
it's a venom the the heart loathes
