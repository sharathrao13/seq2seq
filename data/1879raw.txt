dear mr. inman .
i began by counting the days .
then the months .
i don't count on anything anymore except the hope that you will return .
and the silent fear that in the years since we saw each other .
this war .
this awful war .
will have changed us both beyond all reckoning .
this poor boy's from alabama .
he's a long way from home .
thank you .
why don't them yanks just attack?
got any shirts , son?
it's mo oakley's boy .
can't be old enough to fight , can he?
good morning .
morning , son .
got some boots and jackets .
you want one?
here .
you want that?
thanks .
i hope these boots can hold up for 400 miles ,
'cause they're taking me back to cold mountain .
i think now on the fleeting moments between us
and wish i could repair them .
my awkward nature .
the things left unsaid .
all right , that's it .
enough powder here to blow a hole in the sky .
yeah , a real yankee good mornin '.
that old book of yours is in shreds .
same as us .
seen too much war .
hey , oakley .
don't worry , son .
them yankee boys keep store hours .
they ain't open yet .
close it up .
hey , where'd you come from?
hey , that's fresh breakfast .
he's mine , butcher .
hey !
hey !
get away !
hey , i saw him first .
come on !
i saw it first !
that's my rabbit !
that's my rabbit !
get your paws off my rabbit !
get your paws off my rabbit !
when i came with my father to the town of cold mountain .
i was so shy of how i looked .
so out of place .
but did you know how happy i was to escape from charleston .
from a world of slaves and corsets and cotton?
what do you fools think you'll be fightin 'for?
the south?
i call this nail northern aggression .
damn right .
i call this nail the yankee skulls .
last time i checked , the south was a direction .
never figured you for a lincoln lover , jt .
i tell you , as soon as i finish this chapel ,
i'm gonna go off and kill me some yankees .
piss and vinegar .
fightin 'for a rich man's slave , that's what .
whoa , here comes the minister .
ben , thank you .
will you assist my daughter?
lord have mercy , look at that bonnet .
look what's in it .
oakley , hand me the hammer , boy .
that's a true southern belle .
mr. swanger !
good morning to you .
morning , reverend .
esco , you remember my daughter , ada ,
miss monroe .
good morning .
morning .
morning .
excellent progress .
morning .
mrs. swanger , mrs. castlereagh .
morning , reverend .
now , if y'all will excuse me .
in charleston , my congregation would still be disputing the size of the windows .
it's a chapel .
miss monroe , i was just thinkin 'about you .
cold mountain must feel like the end of the world .
not at all .
it's very beautiful .
well , you put us all to shame .
men up here had a bearing on what they thought a woman was ,
and then you showed up .
oh ...
no , i doubt that .
oh , believe me .
if you was to say a word to one of these fools , i could get my top field cleared .
any one?
no , um ...
him in particular .
up in the rafters .
won't normally say boo to a goose .
he's been pressin 'me since the day you arrived here .
your top field cleared?
that's right .
good morning .
i'm ada monroe .
inman .
inman .
wp inman .
wp inman .
repeatin 'a thing doesn't improve it .
people call me inman .
how 'bout that?
inman speaks .
if you were to take a glass of cider , your friends might stop staring .
inman .
you're just jealous .
i'm gonna take her for a walk at bishop's creek .
billy , is this frame flush?
thank you .
yeah , yeah , yeah .
thank you , yeah , right .
richie , i seen your house .
there ain't a square angle anywhere near it .
and what do you do?
i work wood .
hunt .
mostly work wood .
clear fields?
i can clear a field .
was there something in particular you wished to say to me?
not that comes to me .
i'll say thank you ... for the cider .
# you'll walk unscathed ...
# no ploughman's blade will cut thee down
# no cutler's horn will mark thy face
# i've gone to find my ain true love
# i've gone to find my ain true love
move back !
go back !
move back !
go back !
go back !
they're trapped in the wrong damn crater .
whole plan backfired on 'em .
send them yanks straight to hell .
hold it , hold it .
let's go .
turn it around .
damn fools dug their own grave .
we've got 'em now , boys .
it's a turkey shoot .
what?
it's a turkey shoot .
they've run themselves into a hole .
hell's busted .
oakley !
oakley !
oakley !
inman !
inman !
oakley !
oakley !
inman !
come on .
inman .
i've got you .
i got a few .
you saw?
i saw .
am i gonna die?
your folks can be real proud of you .
son , this fellow says he'll play whatever you want .
what about " bonaparte's retreat "?
that's one i play .
no .
play me somethin 'sweet .
like a girl's waiting for me .
you heard him .
i only know a couple of tunes .
like when you're at bishop's creek ... and you're thirsty ... and the water's so cool .
i don't know what music that is .
i'm reachin 'cold mountain before you .
good morning , sally .
well , that's a fine sounding thing .
oh ...
my piano .
oh , i've been missing it .
thank you , by the way .
inman's in my top field clearing his debt .
oh , dear .
and then he had nothing to say .
he was happy .
really?
are men so different in charleston?
men?
i don't know .
if you're sayin 'you might like him , why not go over and say good mornin '?
i should be gettin 'along .
walk on , quickly .
come on .
walk on .
slowly .
walk on .
whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa .
my dear daughter , ada , who's given up so much for so long to help me in my ministry , and upon whom i rely .
friends , we are both very happy to have this opportunity tonight ... to thank you from our hearts ... for your kind welcome and , most of all , such a fine chapel .
so ... ... thank you , and god bless you .
our house is always open to any of you at any time .
welcome .
esco?
that gentleman he help build the chapel?
him?
no , that's teague .
at one time the teague family owned the whole of cold mountain .
my farm , your farm , it all belonged to his grandpappy .
teague wanted this place bad , and you got it .
and he's here sniffin 'out an advantage .
there's no advantage here , except to celebrate a job well done .
and that is a good thing in these troubled times .
miss monroe .
thank you .
were you never planning to come inside?
i'm wetter than a fish .
there's a good fire going .
i'm all right .
you're always carrying a tray .
i was going to take some root beer over to the negroes .
somebody said you were enlisting .
are you?
if there is a war , we'll all fight .
did you get a picture made?
say again?
a tintype , with your musket and your courage on display .
you're laughin 'at me .
i don't know you .
this doesn't come out right .
if it were enough just to stand , without the words ...
it is .
it is .
you ...
look .
look .
look at the sky now .
what color is it?
or the way ... a hawk flies?
or you wake up ... and your ribs are bruised thinking so hard on somebody .
what do you call that?
i'll do that .
i can't get much wetter .
what if you are killed .
and i'll never see you again?
you said after a few years i would barely remember your name .
oh .
inman .
it is more than three years .
and i remember your name .
soldiers .
don't get up .
you are mentioned tonight in my report .
you men from cold mountain have once again been heroes for the cause .
there are yankees in that stand of trees between us , stuck there from the retreat .
if they stay there .
tomorrow mornin 'they can shoot us down for sport .
go around .
it's a reb !
how many of them are there?
i think there's five .
under the trees .
we got 'em .
let's go , let's go .
butcher's down .
leave him , leave him .
he's gone .
let's go .
go , go !
go !
run !
go !
go !
go !
hold your fire !
what's over by them trees?
it's us !
it's us !
i said hold your fire !
hold your fire .
leave him .
leave him .
inman'll get it .
supposed to bring good luck , a bird caught in a room .
i'm so sorry to have kept you waiting .
she'll just be a few seconds .
mr. inman .
reverend .
what can i do for you?
i have some sheet music .
it belonged to my father .
no use to me .
thank you .
you must come in .
i should probably get along .
mr. inman is more comfortable outdoors .
perhaps we might ... perhaps we might take a walk .
a splendid idea .
let me just get your hat .
i dragged my poor daughter 400 miles from charleston to cold mountain because my doctors , they've been sayin 'my chest is weak .
so the air's supposed to do me good .
but it's the view i think heals .
it's what people say we're fightin 'for .
to keep it that way .
i have no plans to preach war in my church , mr. inman .
i imagine god is weary of being called down on both sides of an argument .
i imagine god is .
thank you .
now , your father played the piano , did he?
that's right .
he was a teacher .
and is your father living , mr. inman?
he is not .
and your mother?
no , sir .
she died when i was born .
# farewell .
vain world
# i'm going home
# my savior smiles and bids me come
# and i don't care to stay here long
# sweet angels beckon me away
# to sing god's praise in endless day
# and i don't care to stay here long
# right up yonder .
christians
secession .
north carolina left the union .
# o. yes .
my lord .
for i don't care to stay here long
we got our war ! # ... that i am born to die
# from grief and woe my soul shall fly
# and i don't care to stay here long
# bright angels shall convey me home
# away to new jerusalem
# and i don't care to stay here long
we got our war !
we got it !
we got it !
it's about time .
all right !
inman !
inman !
ready to fight , son , ready to fight .
we got our war , man .
well , you have your war .
ada .
ada .
it's a great day for north carolina .
those who follow lincoln or preach abolition ... you best keep one eye open when you're sleepin '.
ol 'boogeyman might get you .
are you the law all of a sudden , mr. teague?
that's right , son .
home guard for haywood county .
and i'm the law from today .
y'all go fight now .
we'll watch over your sweethearts .
hey , teague .
why ain't you fightin '?
'cause he's too old .
yeah !
you might be safer back in charleston .
but then who'll be waiting for you?
three cheers for north carolina !
all right .
three cheers for the south !
hip hip hurrah !
hip hip hurrah !
hip hip hurrah !
inman .
it belongs to inman .
i got it .
he's here .
they found that book you been worryin 'about , soldier ,
wait .
i found you this book to take with you .
william bartram .
they tell me it's good .
i think he writes about these parts , the author , so ...
thank you .
and this .
i'm not smiling in it .
i don't know how to do that , hold a smile .
ada .
what?
whoa !
he'll be back in a month .
kiss her for me .
come on , let's go .
i'll be waiting for you .
lookin 'good , butcher .
bring home some yankee scalps , swimmer .
yee haw !
look out the window .
ladies .
see what these poor fools are dyin 'for .
how many would still lose a leg for the rich man's slave?
most of these soldiers'll be dead by morning , or if they're stubborn , by nightfall .
i've other men outside in the courtyard waitin 'for beds , so any kind word will be a blessin '.
it's the heat .
i'm sorry .
they rot .
pigeon river ...
how are you , son?
cold ...
mountain ...
l i'm sorry .
you want water?
cold ...
mountain .
cold mountain?
cold mountain .
do you worry when there's no word from him?
from mr. inman?
yes .
but then i've tried countin 'the number of words which have passed between mr. inman and me not very many .
but i think about him , daddy , all the time .
i lost your mother after 22 months of marriage .
it was enough to fill a life .
that was the last of the ham .
it was delicious .
i have to learn how to cook .
i was thinking of saying something in chapel .
perhaps some of the womenfolk will volunteer .
i can't have people coming here and cooking for me .
i so ...
i so regret ...
i should have raised you less like a companion and more like a young woman .
i'm sorry , ada .
and for dragging you here .
i'm not sorry .
i would have followed you anywhere .
to mongolia .
mongolia .
but with no one left to work this place , nothing to buy , nothing left to buy it with ...
i just don't know how we're gonna get through another winter .
will you play me somethin '?
somethin 'peaceful while i look over my sermon .
it's too damp out here .
you should come inside .
no .
i like it .
daddy , bring the tablecloth in .
come inside before you drown .
you have a letter .
north carolina .
it's come a long way .
it's not too recent .
it's written this past winter .
i'm afraid i can't read who it's from .
dear mr. inman ...
since you've left .
time has been measured out in bitter chapters .
last fall .
my poor father died .
our farm at black cove is abandoned .
every house in these mountains touched by tragedy .
each day the dread ... of learning who has fallen ... who will not return from this terrible war .
and no word from you .
are you alive?
i pray to god you are .
this war is lost on the battlefield and is being lost twice over by those who stayed behind .
he ain't comin 'back , you know that .
you must know that in your heart .
look at me .
look at me .
i'm not nothin '.
i'm still waiting .
as i promised i would .
but i find myself alone and at the end of my wits ... too embarrassed to keep taking from those who can least afford to give .
ada !
it's sally !
ada !
look at the state of this place .
well , set it on the porch .
she let them slaves go free , and now ...
poor soul , she's got nobody and nothin ', and waitin 'on a ghost .
shoo !
go away .
devil !
my last thread of courage now is to put my faith in you ... " and to believe i will see you again .
so now i say to you .
plain as i can ... " if you are fighting .
stop fighting .
if you are marching .
stop marching .
come back to me .
come back to me is my request .
come back to me .
come back to me is my request .
wounded men , don't stray from the hospital grounds .
hey !
if they send us back to fight ...
hey , get your peanuts now , from the blind man .
hey , your hot goobers here .
it's a sad day .
gettin 'better , soldier?
seems that way .
i wouldn't hurry .
the war's almost done .
don't need your help to lose it .
you got ten minutes now , boys .
ten minutes to get your haircuts and shaves .
i've been meanin 'to ask you .
where'd you take your wound?
oh , before i was born .
never set eyes on a thing in this world .
not a tree , a gun or a woman .
put my hand on all three , though .
what would you give for that?
to have your eyeballs for ten minutes .
ten minutes?
i wouldn't give an indian head cent .
might turn me hateful .
that's sure what seein's done to me .
no , that's not the way i meant it .
you said ten minutes .
it's havin 'a thing and then the loss of it i'm talking about .
then we don't agree .
there's not much i wouldn't give for ten minutes of someplace .
yeah , someplace ... or someone .
you watch yourself , now .
they're shootin 'men who take themselves a walk .
by order of zebulon vance , governor of this great state of north carolina , any soldier turned deserter is guilty of treason , and should be hunted down like a dog .
any man who takes in a deserter is likewise guilty of treason .
the home guard is powered to enter any place it sees fit without notice or constraint .
captain teague needs more volunteers .
any man whose age or infirmity prevents him from fightin 'shall join us to protect this county from yankee raiders and traitors to the cause .
is there a letter for me?
nothin '.
we've been gettin 'no post through at all .
the sooner we lose this war the better .
they say not one boy in ten is comin 'home to these mountains .
teague and his rabble throwin 'their weight around .
they're worse than the yankees .
might i speak with you , please?
this was the reverend monroe's .
i don't know who would want a watch .
who can bear to look at the time?
i've got a little salt pork you can have .
keep your daddy's watch .
thank you .
i was talkin 'to some of the other womenfolk about maybe lookin 'in on you at black cove .
it's hard right now , but ...
oh , no .
i manage very well , whatever the talk is .
i'm very grateful for the pork .
which i intend to pay for , of course .
is everything all right?
mm hmm .
ada .
ada .
why , ada , you are skinny as a whippet , girl .
you are comin 'indoors with me .
no , i can't .
i don't ...
i can't keep countin 'on your kindness .
now , come on .
i'm makin 'a stew .
we'd be proud to have you .
esco's gonna be wantin 'his dinner .
i just wanna stop , i tell you .
yeah .
sit on the porch with sal , watch my boys in the fields , holler " good job " every hour or so .
that'll be a good day , when our boys get home .
what about your people in charleston?
there are no people .
and there's no money .
my father had some bonds and investments .
they're worthless now , of course .
the war ...
they're not worth anything .
i don't have anywhere else to go .
i don't wanna go .
you're waiting on a feller .
oh !
look down our well ...
esco ...
she should .
if you look down our well with a mirror , you'll see the future .
it's what they say .
you do it .
she does it .
what kind of mirror?
we'll hold on to you .
esco , you hold on .
i got her .
we got you .
mm .
see anything?
uh ...
uh ...
i don't know .
i tried many a time ,
lookin 'for a sign my boys were comin 'home .
i never saw a dickey bird .
oh !
are you all right?
ada?
what?
what happened?
what'd you see?
what'd you see?
yesterday .
i saw you walkin 'back to me ... " or thought i did .
i found myself crouching over sally swanger's well ...
... like a madwoman staring into its secrets .
was it you i saw walking home to me .
or was it your ghost?
after so long .
i know i must learn to survive on my own
and accept you will not return .
and yet i cannot .
i cannot .
them cows wants milkin '.
if that letter ain't urgent , them cows is is what i'm sayin '.
i don't know you .
old lady swanger says you need help .
here i am .
i ...
i need help but ...
i need ...
i do need help , but i need a laborer .
there's ... there's plowing and rough work .
i think there's been a misunderstanding .
what's that rake for?
the rake?
well , it ain't for gardenin ', that's for sure .
number one , you got a horse?
i can plow all day .
i'm a worker .
number two , ain't no man better'n me ,
'cause there ain't no man around who ain't old or full of mischief .
i know your plight .
my plight?
am i hard to hear?
'cause you keep repeatin 'everything .
i ain't lookin 'for money .
i never cared for it and now it ain't worth nothin '.
i expect to board and eat , at the same table .
i ain't a servant , if you get my meanin '.
you're not a servant .
people's gonna have to empty their own night jars is my point .
and i don't expect to work whilst you sit around and watch , neither .
right .
right .
is that a yes or a no?
there's a rooster .
he's the devil , i'm sure of it .
i go near him and he is at me with his spurs .
he's lucifer himself .
i despise a floggin 'rooster .
oh , no , i wouldn't ...
my name's ruby thewes .
i know your name .
let's put him in a pot .
# i've gone to find my ain true love
you're my angel , my butterfly .
come fly away .
my love ...
god forgive me for doin 'this .
i'm so sorry .
i'm sendin 'you to a better place .
you go fly away .
hey !
don't do that .
don't pull that trigger .
i'm a man of god .
i killed several of them .
i mean i'm god's minister .
what part of god's business is throwin 'a woman down a gorge?
a slave woman .
can you see that in this light?
black as a bucket of tar .
is she dead?
no , i drugged her ,
like you would a butterfly .
and i care for her .
that's the heartbreak of it .
she's got my bastard in her belly .
come on .
back up .
i'm beggin 'you .
git .
it's better you blow out my brains than return me to this place .
you're gonna put her back where she sleeps .
i do that , the members will lynch me for sirin 'a bastard while servin 'as their preacher .
we're a strict congregation .
we've churched men for pickin 'up a fiddle on the sabbath .
so you reckon to kill her?
what , because she's a slave?
i ... um ...
there's a back door .
have pity .
thank you .
i was gonna do a grievous wrong .
i think i should go back up to my wife .
she wakes at the slightest noise .
where's some paper and a pencil?
hey , ada !
you up?
yes .
wha ...?
it's still dark .
tell that to the cows .
it's late .
you all set?
oh , l i just have to eat somethin '.
well , then , you got to get up earlier .
what's that?
a novel .
you wanna carry a book , carry one you can write in .
we got our own story .
catastrophe .
i can spell it , too .
learned it the same place you did , in the schoolhouse .
one of the first words they taught me .
ruby thewes , you are a c a t a s t r o p h e .
three years i was in school , before my daddy ...
sayin 'god rest his soul is like wishin 'him what he had in life .
he lived to rest .
he was born tired .
he decided ... better use for me than havin 'me sat all day in front of a chalkboard .
number one , lay out a winter garden for cool season crops .
turnips right there , onions , cabbage .
collards .
number two , patch the shingles on the barn roof .
have we got a maul and frow?
maul?
maul .
m a u i.
number three , clear and turn this field .
no harm done lettin 'it go .
now we'll do well .
number 15 ... 16 .
number 16 ...
number 16 ...
put up some gourds for a martin colony .
keep away these crows .
one thing in abundance on this farm , and that's crows .
shut the gate .
i'd pay a dollar for an egg .
i've got no quarrel with you .
hey !
am i near the cape fear river?
home guard !
get back there !
runaways !
come on , boys !
let's get 'em !
they're spreadin 'out in the field !
come back here !
they're in the field .
they're in the field !
i can get you outta here .
i daresay that's home guard followin 'you .
they're out on the road , huntin 'down deserters .
and i don't recommend that way .
you'll meet half the town comin 'after me with a noose , thanks to you .
i should have shot you when i had the chance .
i know where there's a ferry crossin '.
or you can stubborn yourself to death .
if this is a trap ...
please yourself .
i'm just bein 'a christian .
you got any money? $5 .
for $5 i wouldn't give a parched man a dipper of this river water .
the sign says " ferry $5 .
nobody crosses these waters unless they're runnin 'from someplace .
you wanna wait for your friends?
i can give you $30 confederate .
well , all right , let's go .
whatever that's worth .
they cut off my hair .
that was hard .
i was vain about my hair .
i had curls .
but i deserved it .
i'm the reverend veasey .
have i seen you in church?
no .
not likely to , neither .
i'd say these days , the devil rules the roost .
30 more dollars , we can go over to that cabin and i can pull this dress over my head .
have we got $30?
get down !
i got one .
is there any other way to cross?
barge or boat .
the water's full of gators .
what's this wood?
i don't know .
in .
i don't know .
pine .
locust?
pine .
where's north?
north?
uh ...
name me three herbs that grow wild on this farm .
i can't .
i can't , all right?
i can talk about farming in latin .
i can ...
i can read french .
i know how to lace up a corset , god knows .
i can name the principal rivers in europe .
just don't ask me to name one stream in this county !
i can ...
i can embroider but i can't darn !
i can arrange cut flowers but i can't grow them !
if a thing has a function , if i might do something with it , then it wasn't considered suitable !
why?
ruby , you can ask why about pretty much everything to do with me .
this fence is about the first thing that i've ever done that might produce an actual result .
so you never wrapped your legs around this inman?
oh !
come on .
fine piano .
if we're careful , now we'll get through winter .
i got old man roy to give me ten of them sheep , on account of i said they's so small , put together they weren't no bigger than six proper sheep .
my father always wanted sheep on this farm .
i cut off my hair once for money .
my daddy got $2 for it .
made a wig for some rich feller in raleigh .
i'm just sayin 'i'm real sorry you had to lose your piano .
ruby , it was my idea .
stobrod liked to call himself a musician .
my daddy .
he could play six tunes on a fiddle .
got hisself shot dead at petersburg .
i was like his goat .
or some critter tethered to a post .
he left me once .
up in them mountains .
i was eight .
he was gone over two and a half weeks .
he left you?
uh huh .
