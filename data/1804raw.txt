talk to her
the stage is full of wooden chairs and tables .
two women come out with robes .
their eyes are closed .
like two sleepwalkers .
you get scared ...
they trip on everything , poor them .
but suddenly , a man appears .
with a very sad face , the saddest i have ever seen .
he pushes tables and chairs out of their way .
you can't imagine how touching it was .
someone was sitting next to me .
in his 40s , handsome .
he cried with emotion , lots of times .
i don't understand why ...
it was very beautiful !
i have a surprise for you !
i have an autograph of rina baus for you .
i had to buy the photo .
i hope you surpass all the obstacles ... ... and start dancing .
she has her period .
it's early .
good evening .
benigno , can you stay tonight?
my sister can't , and i don't have anyone else .
why did you come?
you should have called .
i am not taking advantage of you .
this week you did 3 nights .
don't worry .
a free afternoon is enough for me .
i have to see the house workers .
it's a mess .
and to frame a photo .
my condition is not improving .
the hospital will decide .
your husband left you and the children .
just come the nights you can .
we will be ok .
thanks a lot .
you cut off the intestinal food .
she couldn't take it .
we will try again tomorrow .
yes , go now .
and keep the spirits up !
six bulls and a woman .
wednesday at briuega .
lydia p. gonzales will fight six bulls .
why such a drastic decision?
it's my job .
2 bulls , or 6 .
whatever they say .
people say a lot of bullfighters won't fight with you ... ... because you are a woman .
people can say what they want .
too much chauvinism in bullfighting , but there are exceptions .
nino valencia was happy to share billing with you for several months .
do you think he did it to promote himself?
and when he succeeded that , he abandoned you?
i told you , i don't want to talk about this !
but by talking about certain problems ... ... is the first step towards their solution .
nino valencia ...
enough !
my dear lydia , let me finish the question .
i am not discussing this .
i told you earlier .
you didn't say anything earlier !
it's bad what you are saying !
they will think it's a fixed interview .
and i am on of the few who dare say the truth ... ... and you should dare accept ... that nino valencia took advantage of you .
he shared with you not only the fame , but sex as well .
and he left you when time was right .
juan luis , marco here ...
how are you?
i want to ask you something .
i would like to do an article about lydia gonzales .
yes , i see it too ...
i would like to do something deep .
for the sunday issue?
great ...
the woman has gone crazy !
she dedicates it to you .
she would let the bull injure her , just so that you see it .
you shouldn't have come , especially you .
don't tell me anything .
i know what i am doing .
nino should concentrate .
he doesn't want any more worries .
nothing to worry about .
he should just come to pick up his stuff .
or tell me where to send them .
send them at my place .
he , himself , should say so .
this has nothing to do with you .
you can leave whenever you want .
good evening .
scotch on the rocks , please .
what glass do you prefer?
a tall one .
can i talk to you for a minute , please?
forget it .
when something is over , it's over .
what are you saying?
can i talk to you?
if you take me to madrid , we can talk on the way .
it will be my pleasure .
who named you lydia?
my father .
it's as if he sealed your destiny .
he always wanted to be a bullfighter , but stayed a banderillero .
he is the one that was there for me , more than anyone else .
but he died last year .
i am sorry .
'el pais 'wants me to do a profile on you for their sunday issue .
do you write on bullfighting?
i don't know your name .
to be honest , i know nothing of it .
but i know a lot about desperate women .
and who told you i am desperate?
this is the impression i have .
bullfighting doesn't interest you .
you are interested in my relationship with nino valencia .
tell el pais to leave me alone !
take me from here !
what's going on?
take me from here !
there is a snake in the kitchen .
give me the keys .
the door is open .
calm down .
and stay there .
my purse .
take me to a hotel .
i am never coming back to this house .
to which hotel?
to eurobuilding , lets say .
don't tell anyone about the snake , please .
only my family knows .
i always respect other people's phobias .
after what you have done , how can i say no to the profile?
think about it again .
i will call tomorrow , tell me then .
thanks for everything .
do you want me to stay?
i can sleep on the sofa .
no , i need to get used to being alone .
do you wash her?
what do you think?
how was the night? normal .
give it to me .
i will do it .
i am going now .
good bye .
bye , matilde .
it's so hot !
lets cut her hair . short , it's more practical .
we will leave it as it was when she came here ... ... so that she is not surprised when she wakes up .
after 4 years , it will be great .
i believe in miracles .
so should you .
why me?
because you need them .
one might happen to you , and you will not know .
so hot !
i took something from the drugstore ... ... to help stop the perspiration stains on my uniform .
my armpits are ok , but look at my face .
what's it called?
perspirex .
it's marco ...
remember me?
how are you?
naked .
i need to buy some clothes .
that's all i've got .
i can bring you some from your place .
i don't want anything from there .
maybe another time .
where are we going?
to sybilla .
you think i am crazy .
why?
because i don't want to go home .
no , i understand .
when i separated , i couldn't sleep in the same bed ...
i was sleeping on the sofa , in the living room .
for a week .
until i finally bought a new bed .
so , you are separated .
i am alone .
after a few months
marco , we should talk afterwards .
we've been talking for an hour .
you have , not me .
indeed .
did you read about the nuns that got raped by the missionaries?
priests , themselves !
it's horrible !
yeah , they've gone bad too !
where are we heading to?
first they raped the locals .
then , due to alds , they started raping nuns .
and i admired them so much !
not all of them are rapists , for sure .
no , some of them are pedophiles .
what's that?
everyone loves fucking .
antonio , you are an animal !
how do the bulls look?
good , but fat .
how much do you think?
over 500 kilos .
i am going to the bar .
and don't forget , we are eating home .
if the kids don't see their aunt , there'll be hell to pay .
don't cry , my love .
how is it?
very bad .
it tore her apart .
the father will be happy now !
'not the little one ! ', we kept telling him , my mother and i.
and yet , she became like him .
don't be upset .
what time is it?
it has been four hours .
after three weeks
are you going to cordoba?
yes ...
i would like to stay , but i can't .
we can't do anything extra .
the bar's been closed for 20 days .
the kids are with the neigbhour , and i've neglected the other one .
if something happens , can you be here in 2 hours?
rest assured for that .
we have to have faith .
i light some candles ... ... but i find it very difficult to have faith .
when can we put her medals back on her?
not yet .
with all these ... wounds , the tracheotomy ...
she never took them off .
i will get a vase .
i have to go to the us for three months .
it is very important , says my agent .
and yet ... the way things stand here ... ... i don't want to go .
can you get out for a moment , please?
no smoking here .
did she talk to you that day?
or rather , i talked .
and what did you say?
things that concern me .
did she tell you anything about me?
honestly , lydia hadn't talked about you for a long time .
it's my fault for what happened .
no , it's my fault .
caetano made me freak out .
marco , i've always wanted to ask you something .
why did you cry that night , after you killed the snake?
it brought me lots of memories .
years ago , i had to kill another snake .
we were in africa .
she had the same phobia as you .
she was waiting outside the tent , terrified , defenseless ... ... and totally naked ... ... because she had seen the snake , while we were asleep .
was it the same one who made you sleep in the living room?
i hate that woman .
i haven't seen her for years .
even worse .
what can i do to make you forget her?
exactly what you are doing now .
you were sound asleep .
we didn't want to wake you up .
is dr vega here?
he is in his office .
rosa , close the door .
there's a draft .
she opened her eyes .
that gives me the creeps !
and when she yawns?
i shit myself !
good morning , doctor .
i want to talk to you .
how are you?
did you sleep well?
i will buy you coffee .
how long for might lydia stay like that?
months ... years ... maybe for the rest of her life ...
there is no hope?
as a doctor , i have to say no ...
however ...
resuscltatlon
meryl moon wakes up after 15 years in a coma .
she went into a coma during childbirth .
meryl was a pvs , persistent vegetative state , like lydia , for life .
her recovery contradicts everything i am about to say .
that is , that there is hope .
i insist .
scientifically , no .
but if you want to have faith , ok .
is she opening her eyes?
or i imagine this?
she does , but that doesn't mean she is aware of anything .
her brain cell has been completely destroyed .
however , it can control the automatic functions ... such as breathing , sleeping , waking up and intestinal functions .
she opens her eyes , but mechanically .
her brain is dead .
she has no ideas and feelings .
come in , please .
my name is benigno .
marco zuloaga
this is alicia .
was it your first night here?
the first one is the worst .
then you get used to it .
why these boots?
they prevent her feet from twisting or falling .
they look like 'ibiza 'boots .
i've never been to ibiza .
i know you .
from my books?
it was in cafe muller ...
we happened to be sitting together .
and at some stage , you started crying .
i told you about him .
he cried watching " cafe muller " .
i have to go .
that fast?
we barely talked .
maybe another time .
will you come in the afternoon?
come to see us .
i am always here , even during the night .
i am a 'veteran 'here .
if you need something ...
should i call dr vega?
carry on with what you are doing .
the other day , while browsing my notes ... ... i found some from your visit .
i wrote a topic to be discussed during the second visit ... ... that never took place .
what about?
your sexual orientation .
my sexual orientation? yes , your sexuality .
whether you like men or women .
during your visit , you said you were still a virgin .
answering your question somehow ... ... i think i look for men , mostly .
is this why you came to see me?
i can't remember now .
i guess that's it ...
but i am very well now .
do you have a partner?
more or less .
i am not alone anymore .
i don't have a problem .
i hope you were not offended by my question .
was her father here?
he asked me if i am a fag .
he used an american expression , more subtle .
what is my orientation?
and what did you say?
that i like men .
really?
no , you fool .
i lied .
how can he dare ask whether i like men or women?
what does he care?
i am glad i found out .
did he ask the head nurseor you if you like bestiality or coprophagy?
no , you are right .
they don't ask such things .
i might go on a trip , and i won't be able to come and see you .
but , in geneva , they've offered me a creation ... ... a chorography that thrills me .
an old idea for a ballet .
i call it 'trenches '.
it is about the first world war .
i will need a lot of dancers ... ... because in the war there are a lot of soldiers .
but everyone dances in geneva .
it is great .
i want female dancers too , because the soldier when dying ... ... lets his soul get out of his body ... ... the ghost of which will be a female dancer .
with a white classic skirt like 'giselle '... ... but with red stains of blood .
very good !
alicia loved it .
it's good because life emerges out of death . the female emerges from the male .
and from the earthly emerges the ...
the beach?
and from the earthly emerges the ...
the water?
the ethereal .
the ethereal ... the impreceptible , the ghost .
i have the music .
it is from kristof penderesky .
it was written for the victims of hiroshima , but it's ok .
of course .
alicia remembers it perfectly well .
it's music for the battle .
it's wild and beastly .
and regarding the music during deaths i have a masterpiece ... ... which you will listen to , right now .
it will drive you crazy .
alicia , my dear .
good bye , my dear .
good bye , katerina .
and you look beautiful .
you should go ahead with 'trenches '.
i will .
look ...
we will place you next to the window .
you will be able to see your friends dancing .
i love this room .
i will order everything .
come in and shut the door ...
how are you? ...
sit down .
alicia , look who's here .
we're just getting some air , reading magazines ...
who was the lady that just left?
katerina , alicia's teacher .
dancing teacher .
nice character , katerina .
she has a dancing school somewhere here .
alicia was her student .
and katerina loves her like her daughter .
four years ago
benigno , you are by the window for half an hour .
i am coming , mum .
what's the matter?
are you following me?
this is yours , i think .
you must have dropped it .
is everything there? ...
i didn't touch anything ...
where are you going?
home .
can i accompany you?
i have nothing else to do .
yes , but i am going home .
of course ...
it will do me good .
dancing is my life .
i love dancing shows .
do you like dancing?
yes , of course
but i don't follow it .
what else do you do , besides dancing?
i travel and watch old movies .
silent cinema is attractive to me , in particular .
where do you go when you go out?
i don't .
you should go out .
i was taking care of my mother , but she passed away 2 months ago .
i am sorry .
mine died too , years ago though .
here we are ...
thanks for the wallet .
dr roncero , psychiatrist .
7th left .
twenty three .
i was waiting for her by the window , but that day she didn't come .
but i knew her address and that her father was a psychiatrist .
dr roncero's office .
i would like to make an appointment .
is it tomorrow at 5 ok?
isn't earlier possible?
no , tomorrow at 5 .
your name?
what do you want?
i have an appointment at 5 .
come in .
don't stand there .
benigno martin? ...
i need some proof .
i just wanted to see alicia , but i was there , in a psychiatrist .
i decided to tell him i missed my mother .
i started when i was little .
and all those 15 years you took care of your mother?
i was always next to her ...
i was studying to be a nurse .
i was only going out to the classes .
i was also studying aesthetics , make up and hairdressing .
but those by post .
so you did those on your mother?
of course , and i cut her hair , dyed it , did her nails .
and i scrubbed her down well , front and back .
my mother wasn't disabled , or mad .
she was only a bit lazy .
she was a beautiful woman and i didn't want to let herself go .
what did your father say?
nothing .
what could he?
is he dead?
god , no .
he is in sweden , i guess .
i haven't heard of him for years .
doesn't he come to see you?
he has his own family there , after he left my mother .
we are not in touch .
why did you come to see me , benigno?
what's your problem?
me?
nothing .
you must have since you came to see a psychiatrist .
loneliness , i guess .
did you have a sexual relationship with a woman?
with a man?
no , neither .
i will see you in a week .
am i not well doctor?
that's not it ...
however , your adolescence was kind of special .
it wasn't special .
it was .
very special .
and we must analyse it in depth .
yes , lets analyse it .
should i come in a week?
very well .
i am glad .
what are you doing here?
i was just going .
don't be angry .
i just wanted to see you ...
but i am harmless .
dr roncero's office ...
hi , lola ...
i just had a shit of huge dimensions .
can you be in charge?
alicia never came back .
i didn't want to scare her again .
after a week i went to her place , to see her father .
it was raining during that whole week .
next time i saw her was here .
what happened to her?
a car accident , during a rainy day .
her father didn't want her to be alone , not even for a moment .
he asked for the best nurses .
and i have a good reputation here ...
so they suggested me ...
and when he saw me , he remembered me , and hesitated for a moment .
but in the end , he took matilde and me , exclusively .
and this was four years ago ...
and here we are now ...
right , alicia?
i started going to the ballet , when i had a day off .
and to the film library to watch silent movies .
german , american , italian films , everything .
and afterwards i would tell her about all that she had seen .
the four most complete years of my life .
i take care of alicia ...
i do what she would , except the trips , of course .
with me and lydia it's the opposite .
i can't touch her .
i don't recognize her body .
neither can i help the nurses turn her around .
and i feel i am lousy .
talk to her .
tell her that .
i would like to , but she can't hear me .
how are you so certain about this?
her brain is dead , benigno .
the woman's mind is a mystery , especially in such sickness .
you must look after the woman , talk to her ... ... don't foget that she's alive and that you love her .
this is the only therapy .
i know from experience .
and what do you know about women?
benigno , what do you know about women?
what do you know about women?
a lot .
20 years next to one , 4 with another .
i like the bullfighter's boyfriend .
he has style .
how do you know?
you saw him?
of course not , but i can tell from his face .
and his bulging trousers .
he is a good friend of benigno , right?
is he gay too?
no way .
what are you saying now?
is benigno , you think?
rumours say so !
you are wrong .
dr vega told me so as well .
and where did he find out?
from alicia's father .
i don't like the intimacy he has with the patient ... ... but vega told me not to worry , becayse he is gay .
i am going and i'll let you carry on talking crap about him .
she likes benigno .
she is not with her senses .
i have the day off .
i am going to the film library .
are you coming?
i will see my publisher tonight .
i have to go back to work soon .
this woman is not well .
you know what i mean .
her skin is dry .
lets see ...
here ...
did you talk to her?
no , and don't insist .
hi , lydia .
you must be patient with him .
have a good time at work .
'shrinked lover '.
rosa has the flu .
i hope you didn't get it from her .
i am glad you feel well , but i will massage you ... ... and i will rub you with a rosemary lotion .
no , nothing is happening to me .
last night i saw a movie that shook me a lot .
it was the love story ... ... of alfredo , a nice young guy , but a bit fat ... ... kai amparo's friend who is a scientist .
amparo prepares a new experimental diet ... ... that will revolutionize the food industry .
what egoism !
you only think of yourself !
i found it !
it might be dangerous .
i never gave it to a human before .
you still think i act with selfishness?
it has done miracles for you !
don't worry , my love !
i will find the antidote !
time was passing by ... ... but amparo couldn't find the antidote ... ... and poor alfredo , day by day , shrank in misery .
i will always love you .
so that amparo doesn't suffer ... ... alfredo leaves and goes to find his mother .
he hadn't seen her for 10 years , beacause he was lousy .
he hadn't told ambaro where his mother lived .
lots of things going on in this movie .
but the most important thing is ... ... after years full of regrets and studies ... ... amparo finds the address of his mother .
and goes there .
hotel lukali .
room 15 .
sleep , my darling .
and what if i be a burden by mistake?
and alfredo ... ... stays inside her ... ... for ever .
after one month
come on , put your hands correctly ...
this way ...
it's quite cool ...
it's great ...
it's nice here by the balcony , right?
lydia likes to sit by the balcony as well .
did you hear that?
she likes it a lot .
look at them ...
it's as if they are talking about us .
what do you think they say?
they have no shame .
women talk about everything with each other .
lydia would tell her she has completed two months sick .
benjamin and angela ... ... will you bond in marriage , with your own will?
join your hands together ... ... and declare your wish in front of god .
i , angela , take you , benjamin ... ... to be my lawful husband ...
i will love you in happiness and in sickness ... ... so long as we shall both live .
the lord that joined you in love ... ... let him accept your declaration of love today .
may your love last eternally .
what are you doing here?
we were gonna meet at the hotel .
i changed my mind .
i've always liked weddings .
weren't you gonna see your sister before the game?
i called her .
she will come to the hotel .
i promised her we will eat at the restaurant tonight .
as you wish .
nice ceremony , right?
excellent .
i didn't expect her so young .
you don't trust me right?
we can't have another day passing by without talking .
don't worry .
finish with angela , i have proof .
for example , at the ceremony i didn't cry , you did .
right .
and you shouldn't have .
don't you believe me?
i needed 10 years to get over it .
i finally made it .
lydia , trust me , it's over .
i travelled with angela .
the excuse was to write a travel guide .
in reality , i wanted her out of madrid and drugs .
madrid is hell .
our relationship functioned outside it .
after five trips , i brought her to her parents ... ... who kept her away from drugs and from me .
did you still love her?
i cried not being able to share things with her .
it's terrible to leave a person you love so much .
what a sad story !
love is a sad thing when it ends ... ... as the song says .
marco , we need to talk afterwards .
we've been talking for an hour .
you have , not me .
you're right .
my leg needs two months of therapy , said the doctor .
but you know what?
i am glad that bull hit me .
now i can stay with you until you wake up .
no one will take me away from you .
we got back together , a month ago ...
lydia would tell you at the wedding .
she didn't in the end .
it was you she cried for .
she called me to tell me she cried for me .
last time we spoke .
now that i don't fight due to injury ... ... i would like to stay near her during the night .
like at your place .
i am alone again .
you were looking at her breasts .
difficult to avoid it .
they grow by the day .
benigno , i am thinking of taking a trip ...
i have to work .
and lydia?
she doesn't need me anymore .
did you break up?
you can call it that way .
i expected this , marco .
don't ask why , i just did .
there was something in your relationship that didn't function right .
when are you going?
soon , but i'll see you before i go .
i am so sorry you are going .
i am leaving , benigno .
i'll see you soon .
she didn't have her period yet?
i am looking at the month's report .
she should have had it .
yes , it's a bit late .
two weeks .
that's a lot .
are you sure she had it last month?
i personally dealt with it .
it was when you had the flu .
she seems a bit swollen .
they often have abnormalities .
for example , lydia doesn't have a period anymore .
anyway , we should tell dr vega .
i brought some of my guides for alicia and you .
i said goodbye to lydia .
i went to see alicia , but they didn't let me enter the room .
is there something wrong?
no .
just some infection that alicia got .
can you drive me home?
i am done with work .
it's not serious , i hope .
i don't know .
they do some medical exams , but they haven't told me anything .
brazil ... ... turkey , cuba .
i will read them to alicia .
they are guides .
yours .
they must be good .
are you travelling alone?
yes .
i would like to talk to you about this before you go .
about what?
loneliness .
i want to get married .
alicia , of course !
benigno , you are nuts !
we will get along better than most couples .
why shouldn't i marry her?
because she is in a coma !
because she can't say 'yes 'in the church !
because , she is virtually dead !
get in the car !
what are you talking about?
get in the car !
your relationship with alicia is a crazy monologue !
we often talk to pvs , but we don't marry them .
incredible what you are saying .
i had a different opinion of you .
don't say or think about it ever again !
promise ! ...
if you say that to anyone else , you will be in trouble !
if that calms you down , then i promise .
regardless of how much you like her ...
you like her too , right?
of course i like her .
she likes you too .
she is virtually dead !
she has no feelings about me , you , or herself !
understand that !
our patient alicia roncero was raped and is pregnant .
before i tell her father i want you to tell me ... ... which bastard did it !
everyone is upset .
you are responsible .
alicia was on your floor .
then allow me to explain the situation .
rosa , please .
alicia's period stopped two months ago .
i thought it was one month initially , but i was wrong .
it wasn't in last month's report .
it says it was dealt with normally .
i was down with flu during that week .
you wrote that .
right , benigno?
it is your typewriting .
yes , it was me .
why did you lie?
i didn't want it to become a problem .
on other occasions , the patients 'periods have also stopped .
how come no one noticed?
where is the night person?
she can't come today .
she phoned .
didn't see notice anything strange?
she has problems at home .
a lot of nights she doesn't come .
and who replaces her?
i will tell roncero that his daughter ... ... is day and night with a nutter?
lets calm down for a bit .
benigno , do you realise you are the prime suspect?
why did you hide the first delay?
what explanation do you have?
would you ever harm alicia?
definitely not !
last night i was at the parkin lot ... ... and overheard a discussion between benigno and marco .
benigno said he wanted to marry alicia .
marco tried to change his mind , but in vain .
lots of couples , he said ... ... don't get along as well as him and alicia .
after elght months
it was lydia gonzales 'funeral yesterday , at almudena .
the thirty year old bullfighter was in a coma since ...
can i speak with benigno martin?
he doesn't work here anymore .
are you sure?
positive .
and sister rosa lazaga?

i came today .

a friend .
marco zuloaga is my name .
can i see your i. d.?
can i call him?
he will call you .
i have changed number .
can you give him the new one?
and remember .
visiting days are saturday and sunday .
but the lodger should ask for the visit .
if he doesn't want to see you , there is nothing we can do .
and something else .
we don't have prisoners here ...
we don't have prisoners here , we have lodgers .
marco , is that you?
i am glad to hear your voice .
i asked your visit on saturday .
where are you?
outside the clinique .
dr vega told me everything .
how could you do it?
did you come back to spain to get on my back?
do you need anything?
what should i bring you on saturday?
i need information .
what do you know about alicia?
they wouldn't say anything from the clinique .
she is in a different one .
they don't know where .
i don't believe this .
neither do i.
but i am not surpised they won't tell us .
are you still my friend?
of course .
since i am here .
then find out about alicia .
whether she's alive , whether she gave birth , whether the baby is alive ...
i need to know , marco ...
you understand , right?
i will try to ...
talk to you on saturday ...
did you find out anything?
i will .
be patient .
i was , until the day she would give birth .
one month ago .
you must wait .
what do you do during the day here?
i work in the recovery room .
it's a new prison , few people .
it's quiet in here .
it doesn't look like a prison from outside .
the problem is elsewhere !
that i don't see alicia .
the doctor ki o dr roncero say i am a psychopath .
this is good for the trail , they say , but i don't care about the trial .
i need to see alicia , to find out how everything went .
if this goes on , i don't know what i am capable of doing !
i am a psychopath , they say?
then i will act like one !
don't say that , benigno !
and find me another lawyer .
the one i have despises me .
i will rent my place so that i can pay him .
i will rent it .
i am currently homeless .
great .
i am glad you will be my tenant .
i was thinking about you a lot , especially during the nights .
why during the nights?
because i study during the nights .
i read all your guides .
like travelling with you next to me ... ... telling me things .
i liked avan's the most .
i became one with those people ... ... that have nothing and invent everything .
and you describing the cuban girl ... ... in front of her window by the sea ... ... waiting in vain ... ... for something that will never happen .
i was thinking that woman is me .
good morning .
i am benigno's friend .
you are marco , the argentinian?
benigno called me .
will you take his appartment?
it will be dirty .
he wouldn't let me in to clean it .
and i didn't want any money ...
it's ok , i will take care of it .
shall i give you the key? ...
i will go look for it ...
did you see him?
how is he?
well .
poor guy , he wasn't even lucky during his imprisonment .
no publicity !
no tv , no reporters .
no one came here .
they didn't condescend !
and they show such garbage !
i would give them an interview !
the media is shit in this country !
you are right .
the keys ...
anyway ...
do you know why benigno is in prison?
he is very quiet .
he didn't say a word last time he came .
benigno is innocent .
yes , i know .
innocent about what?
i don't know .
you do , but you don't want to tell me .
if you need something , you know where i am .
i was glad you stepped in by yourself today , without crutches .
how did the exercise go today?
very well .
were you tired?
a lot .
it doesn't matter .
we will do some extra exercises .
we will do some stretches .
but i already did 100 .
we'll do a few more .
i have an appointment with mr. sainz .
the boy was born dead .
alicia recovered .
benigno hasn't found out .
in his condition , he could do something crazy .
i can't lie to him .
he is my only friend .
i will tell him .
i have no problem .
alicia is still in coma and the baby dead , i will say .
but you don't tell him anything .
can he bail out?
very difficult , and expensive .
you are wet .
a little .
be careful not to catch a cold .
drink hot milk with honey .
since i am here , i like rainy days .
dld you see the new lawyer?
he was here ... he told me everything ...
i will loose , right?
frankly , yes , you will .
at least nothing happened to alicia during birth .
it's the only thing that consoles me and gives me hope .
are you ok , benigno?
i would like to hug you so much , marco .
but i have to ask for a meeting face to face .
i tried .
they asked me whether you are my lover .
i didn't dare say 'yes 'since that would annoy you .
it wouldn't annoy me at all .
you can say whatever you want .
i have hugged very few people in my life .
message !
i was very happy to see you and say goodbye today .
they won't let me get out of here ... ... or they will put me somewhere else
i don't want to live without alicia ... ... without being able to hold not one pin of hers .
therefore i will escape .
i didn't tell you so that you won't stop me .
i hug you firmly , marco .
in zegovia ...
yes , in prison ...
i urgently need to see benigno martin .
it's a matter of life and death .
the warden is waiting for you in his office .
me?
where is his office?
the guard will accompany you .
empty your pockets , please .
wait , don't run .
in there at the end .
good morning .
i am marco zuloaga .
benigno martin left this letter for you .
dear marco ...
it's still raining , and this is a good sign .
when alicia had the accident , it was raining too .
i am writing to you a few minutes before i escape .
i hope , with all these , to fall in a coma as well ... ... and to be near her .
you are my only friend .
i am leaving you the house i prepared for me and her .
wherever they take me , come to see me and talk to me .
tell me everything , without hiding anything .
goodbye , my friend .
i took these from him and these i found at his cell .
you must sign here .
benigno , it's me .
alicia is alive ...
you woke her up .
i got your message and ran immediately to tell you ... ... but it was too late .
i put a pin of alicia in your pocket .
and a photo of hers .
and a photo of your mother .
so that they can be with you in eternity .
like wild waves .
the male on top , the female below .
i will bring some water .
are you ok?
i don't know ...
i am much better now .
come on , lets go inside .
you tremble .
why?
what did you tell her?
noting .
i saw you talking .
she asked if i am ok , and i thanked her .
you will see me around .
i live near the dancing school .
in benigno's place?
why do you stay there?
benigno is dead .
one day , we should talk .
yes , and it will be simpler than you thought .
nothing is simple .
i am a dancing teacher , and nothing is simple . and nothing is simple .
