franta ...

during world war ii hundreds of czechoslovak pilots fought with the british against the nazis .
after the war the communists seized power in czechoslovakia and jailed the pilots who had returned home .
they feared these heroes would once again fight for freedom .

i flew for the raf .
in england .
i see !
let there be no mistake .
this is a forced labour camp .
you are educated men so you know what it means .
our " amnesty " cart .
it has only one route to the cemetery and back .
the only amnesty you're ever going to know ...
lie on your side .
better than on your back .
did you see that? what?
the tattoo on his arm .
he's an ss man .
you're kidding !
they're in the kitchen too .
you're in here with ss men?
so are you .
but i didn't fight against them .
there you go .
i did .
olomouc airfield , czechoslovakia , 1939

too much throttle?

i give up .
like a natural .

she ran to the hangar .
of course , gregora's stuffing her with salami again .
give me the hangar .

tomorrow you're flying solo .
00 : 06 : 46, 860 > 00 : 06 : 48, 851 hangar , you got my dog there?

00 : 07 : 08, 740 > 00 : 07 : 09, 729 that's all ,
gentlemen .

the show's over .
barcha ...

adolf hitler speaks ,
you're the one we've been waiting for , bastard !
not you !
quiet !
you know what my mother said? what?
i'll end up marrying kanka .
that lollipop man down there?
he'll be completely bald soon .
but he's set his sights on me .
and you think i haven't?
quiet !
my parents !
think they don't know?
know what?
that we're in love .
of course they know , but not that i let you love me so ... deeply !
what's that?
that's him . who?
kanka , of course .
he serenades me every night to touch my heart .
hanichka .
i'm coming , papa .
just a minute !
hanichka , please open the door !
papa ...
good evening .
captain !!
mr. pechar , let me explain ...
they're repeating it over and over .
at six a . m . on march fifteenth the armed forces of the german reich will begin occupying our country ,
any resistance will be met with brutal retaliation ,
i'm sorry .
cry all you want . who wouldn't?
all units will be disarmed ,
no aircraft , military or civilian , are to leave their bases ,
turn it off !
cut the engine !
i'm taking it to poland . we can't let them have it !
pilot officer , switch off your engine now !
didn't you hear the order?
yes , but i didn't like it .
nobody's asked your opinion .
get out ! why did you think the others aren't taking off?
because it's suicide in this weather !
you'll crash into the first hill !
i know .
everything is conspiring against us .
england , france , the weather , even my back , everything . we should tell our men the poles will need pilots , ground crews too ,
because poland is next in line .
nothing official .
volunteers .
preferably , single men .
they're here .
slama , please take over .
i can't move .
let's call it an order .
yes sir .
good morning gentlemen .
ober lieutenant hesse !
it's my duty to take over this airfield .
our commanding officer , wing commander skokan is physically indisposed .
i'm in charge .
lieutenant slama .
this whole army seems " physically indisposed " .
what a lovely map !
so , yesterday we were here . we had a good look at your famous defences .
abandoned without a shot?
as a soldier , i can't understand it .
sir , kindly do your duty and respect the honor of soldiers who have been forced to do theirs .
keep your shirt on .
just a little joke .
now , i'd like to see the planes .
gentlemen !
the keys , please .
all right boys , let's go .
i can imagine how you must feel .
a german officer would put a bullet in his head .
but you are ... a little different , aren't you?
pilot officer voytishek !
i've got a spare seat .
thank you , but i'll stick with the boys .
you're taking it too personally .
how else !
i felt like throwing up in the hangar . we carried out an order .
now we can go home , take off our uniforms , and take it personally .
how long will it take you to pack?
me?
no time at all .
don't forget to brush out her ears .
thistles get stuck in there .
she'll be grateful .
and in winter ice forms on these hairs between her pads .
they hurt her , so you have to cut them out .
but i'll be back well before then .
she'll listen to me?
of course .
she knows you're a part of me .
what's this?
in case you come back at night and the house is locked .
thank you .
you don't have any documents on you?
in case we're searched?
no , mr slama .
good .
and call me franta .
and you can call me karel .
i know .
i don't know how to put it ...
sir , i mean franta ... but i do have some documents i'd like to take with me . what are they?
no , forget it , i'll get rid of them .
you'd only laugh at me .
no , i won't .
promise .
let's see them .
horses?
that's only camouflage .
there's worse .
she's my only girl .
i'd rather not part with her .
your only girl?
then you should keep her .
thanks .
sir ,
i mean franta !
look !
oh god !
barcha , you mustn't do this .
go home .
go home !
back to hanichka .
go home !
go or i'll hit you !
what's she doing?
she keeps turning around but she is going back .
england , 1940
i can't see shit .
shut up !
we're pedaling like maniacs .
this is stupid .
i'm knackered !
behind you !
break left !
you bastards . why don't you let us fly !
what's he saying?
get up . we're doing it again .
no !
to hell with this !
it's not what i came here for !
on your bikes !
out of my way .
what'd he say?
he says you're myrtvy .
thanks .
may i keep her?
one week .
it means le ... lend , stupid .
shut it !
open your mouth wider !
no language !
just madness .
stop fooling about , karel .
ladies !
excuse me , a fortnight without just isn't healthy .
a little well in an open field ,
i'm trying to do your mouth , so shut it ! why don t we go to the beach sometime .
i've never swum in the sea .
it's freezing .
just to dip our toes .
hey .
look ! what do you think he's saying?
he's trying to land them .
i'd just get a slap in the face .
you mustn't frighten them .
machaty begins by asking the way .
say , to the officers 'mess .
but doesn't he know where it is?
it's a device . women like to help you when you're in trouble when ... they don't feel threatened .
it's how you break the ice .
did machaty tell you that?
it's common knowledge .
great !
i guess english is important after all .
there's no resemblance .
you just shut up deadman . with your name you don't belong in a plane but a coffin .
this supposed to be me?
yes , i'd like you to have it .
grinning like an idiot for this !
it's only good to scare kids !
what did he say?
monkey catching .
us?
makes sense . we've done just about everything else .
lift up your shirt .
were you in france , when we invaded?
yes .
and what did you think?
how you moved !
breathtaking .
don't breathe .
blitzkrieg .
a short and sweet war .
take a deep breath .
it was hard to be a german and not be proud .
you can breathe now .
the english returned from their missions with empty magazines , and all we could do was circle the airfield , target shooting ,
three months later ...
lend me another to do the tits .
this one?
no , i need her .
a little well , made of stone , in an open field stands alone ,
and its water is ,
that's us you idiots !
finally !
show yourselves , bastards !
there they are !
two o'clock low !
oh shit !
boys , don't jump the gun ,
fire only when they're squarely in your sights ,
shit !
boys !
messerschmitts !
a whole swarm of them !
tom tom , on your tail !
i can see him ,
but he's glued to my arse .
boys , you noticed , i don't stutter when i'm shit scared?
tom tom can't bail out !
n2 , roger .
n3 , roger ,
move yourself , bastard !
n2 !
dive to sea level !
i can't hear you .
dive to sea level ,
too little fuel to follow you !
what?
bedrich , we're not fighting anymore , it's beddy byes now .
the germans are also beddy byes , they've stopped firing .
even hitler is beddy byes with eva braun .
lying on your heart is no good , it can give you nightmares .
look at sysel , sleeping nicely on his back .
good old moravian pig ...
we have different things in mind . what do you mean?
i want ... you know what ... and she just wants to teach me english .
she says after the war ... for the other .
the one next to her doesn't look as if she'd need to wait for peace .
she's more than i could handle .
and her?
she's machaty's .
she's your date?
you said it !
it's amazing ... how calm they are .
and that'll be hitler's downfall .
because he's a hot head like our voytishek .
me a hot head?
just you wait !
you know what's crossed my mind?
what?
maybe i'm not handling her right ,
we go for long walks , she doesn't stop talking ,
of course we kiss but ,
do you think she expects me to pounce on her?
i wouldn't know , but shut up for now , okay?
but think about it , will you?
sure ,
franta ! what?
i see him ,
one o'clock , hugging the ground ,
he's yours , karel ,
i'm going in ,
franta , i'm hit !
can you hear me?
karel !
oh god !
out of the way !
i'll start her up .
are you alright?
in hospital?
stitched up his stomach . who's that?
sysel .
he was holding his guts .
it was oozing blood .
he'll be there for a week at least .
you land on your head when you bailed out yesterday?
not on my head , on a woman !
and i fell madly in love with her .
i'm crazy about her .
really?
i'm going mad .
one could ...
one could escape from here .
i'd like to know how .
you see that barbed wire over there?
if one got hold of a pair of pliers ...
the wall's only five meters .
gentlemen .
it's my birthday today .
fifty .
your health , doctor !
my father died at fifty .
also a doctor .
in reichenberg .
you know how many people came to his funeral?
a hundred and twenty seven .
my sister counted them all .
they loved him so .
that's life ...
how many people did you kill in the war , mr. slama?
no idea .
take a guess .
maybe ten .
me , not one .
have you ever seen an execution?
i did .
in prague .
at kobylisy .
i had to check that the people were dead .
for a whole month .
day in day out .
how do i look?
ravishing .
really?
you're pulling my leg?
get out , you romeo .
wait here .
i'll give you a sign .
lovely , isn't she?
i prefer bigger tits , but she is pretty .
how do you say " vinegar " in english?
well , what do you think?
beautiful , karel .
really beautiful .
not asleep , honza?
jura sysel died , so i'm scoring his favorite tune for the english to play at his funeral .
there are so many parts , the clarinet , all the brass ... it takes some doing to sound right .
keep at it ...
know what i'm sad about?
no . what?
i really liked sysel , but i never told him .
men don't talk about such things but i'm sure he knew .
he couldn't have , because i didn't know myself .
he got on my nerves .
his moravian yodeling really pissed me off .
it's only now i know i liked him .
let's get some sleep .
in war men should tell each other how they feel .
nothing wrong with him .
just his face smashed up . we'll get him in the morning .
honza?
who messed you up like this?
kolichek .
he hit me ...
i hit the stove .
herr commandant has a hard stove .
he's a snake .
check my fingers .
god i hope my fingers are all right .
they're okay .
you'll play again .
00 : 58 : 23, 660 > 00 : 58 : 26, 015 they are all the same .
the same blows .
nazi interrogations , communist interrogations , no difference .
also a pilot?
it's machaty , the pianist .
so tell me herr slama why are you all locked up in here?
i understand why i'm here . we lost the war and must be punished .
but you?
i don't understand .
what did you do to them?
nothing .
nothing?
but what were you tried for?
there was no trial .
well , well , machaty .
back in england i bet you never dreamt they'd welcome you home with such a sad song .
you said it .
had you known , you wouldn't have fought us so?
that's where you're wrong .
did she say anything about me?
she said you were sweet .
sweet , sweet ...
something she didn't like about me?
no , nothing .
you can't drive in this fog . who'd i bump into?
no one drives in such fog .
some other love sick idiot like you?
i have to see her .
listen to me .
maybe she's worried that i'm ... too young?
did she say i was sweet once or twice?
six times , you fool .
go on then .
but be careful .
can you believe it?
she wasn't home .
a strange woman was there . where did you sleep?
in the car .
she went to see her brother in london .
why do i have to get the shits before each flight?
better before than during .
blue four .
my engine is playing up .
permission to return to base , franta?
what's the problem?
it's misfiring , losing power .
permission granted ,
you might call them small tits , but you should see them !
messerschmitts !
franta , watch out !
get among them so they can't aim !
tally ho !
karel , get him !
well done , karel ,
go lower , machaty ,
take the one in the back ,
machaty , watch your back side !
when goliath spits in his eye ,
david swings his sling ,
one was big and one had courage ,
goliaaath !
my first !
it's my first !
there's something i've got to tell you .
no , franta .
it's important .
i need to talk to you .
karel , listen .
no , listen to me !
you listen to me !
it's so nice to be in love .
she may not want me , but i'm still happy .
maybe a little unhappy too , but still happy .
are you asleep?
look , karel ...
remember when you went to see her 01 : 06 : 52, 300 > 01 : 06 : 54, 495 in that terrible fog?
susan ... came here to see me .
i told her we were best friends , and sent her away .
i was afraid to tell you then .
but you should know , even if it hurts .
i've a really bad toothache .
you're not going up today?
i must see the dentist .
know what the mechanics call you?
boomerang .
takes off and comes right back . when your engine's ...
there's nothing wrong with your engine .
they checked it .
i can't help it .
i get diarrhea before each flight and throw up when we land .
i only eat what comes up easily .
porridge , custard ...
you could apply for a transfer to the ground crew .
no one would blame you .
you mean not fly anymore !
i'd be the first to regret it .
i feel safer having you behind me .
i'll see the dentist tomorrow .
and all the way , i kept asking myself , why was i going there?
the only answer was that
i wanted her to write karel a kinder letter ,
to give him some hope ,
yes , that was it ,
but i forgot it was sunday ,
visiting day for the parents of susan's evacuees ,
where were you?
in london .
at the embassy .
get into a fight there?
no . why?
your button's missing .
really?
i'll ask pierce to see to it tomorrow .
that's my locker .
i am sorry karel .
i'm really sorry .
so goering has three balls?
no !
two , but small .
so , hitler has one , goering two ...
but small .
so who has none?
you , mrtvy , you have none !
franta , that's us !
let's go , old man .
achtung , die spitfiren !
come back , it was only me !
you arsehole .
see the train?
shall we give the driver a chance?
and the stoker ,
okay , let's go .
you take out the engine , i'll go for the tanker wagons ,
watch out for that atack gun !
karel !
can you hear me?
can't see , belly landing ,
shit !
you wait here ! we'll check on the peasants .
where is the pilot?
do you understand? where is the english dog?
plane kaput .
dog out .
plane boom ... and dog run ... there ...
let's go !
jeannette !
get up !
it's over !
they've gone !
get up !
it's over , they've gone !
get in !
climb in !
don't be a fool , franta , there's no room !
shut up and get in !
hang on !
you're sitting on my arm !
can you reach the throttle?
i can't .
how's the fuel? wouldn't know?
i can't see the gauge .
neither can l !
stop fidgeting ,
i think you've dislocated my shoulder !
you're crazy !
stop moving around !
what's your code name?
and the emergency frequency?
next time , on the back .
that'll smudge when you sweat .
good luck .
thanks .
be careful !
so , the dentist? worse than war .
the man's a maniac . why?
just pulls teeth out ,
good or bad !
pleased to hear it . what?
that you don't have toothache anymore .
i see .
you're going to fly in pairs .
you'll look after the new chap .
me?
yes , you .
take care !
not only is it dark around me , but i cannot see ,
i know there is darkness all around but i cannot see it ,
that's beautiful .
my god that's beautiful .
it is , but i can't play it forever .
oh yes , you can .
it's the only one i want to hear .
will you teach me to play it?
all right .
i wanted a piano .
but ...
my dad said he'd buy me an accordion instead ... said it also had keys .
it's true , a piano doesn't really belong on a farm .
you start playing and you get the cows mooing along .
you'll teach it to me?
i will .
but now it's time for bed .
not yet .
once more .
one last time .
okay , one last time .
you haven't finished your drink yet .
so , tell me , where 's my perfect vision gone?
the dense blue cloud now covers all , the impenetrable dark blue world ,
what are you celebrating , you night owls?
don't i get a drink?
tell him .
he's not going to fly with you anymore .
you bastard !
i'll kill you .
i was always so afraid i'd lose you .
but this is worse than if you had died on me .
forgive me , karel , if you can .
i didn't want this .
bedrich , bail out !
you're on fire !
bedrich 's still inside ,
what are you doing !
karel?
karel landed?
yes , but bedrich's missing . where is he?
i don't know .
what got into you?
i'll kill you !
think i don't know?
firing at me from behind !
son of a bitch !
fired at me full on !
over a woman !
can you believe it?
a german soldier could not do this .
to his own comrade .
i've lost a lot of respect for you , herr ober lieutenant .
very much .
have you never met a woman who made you lose your senses?
no woman could do that to me .
then i'm sorry for you .
i'm sorry for you .
for you comradeship is nothing but a bubble .
you blow at it , and it's gone .
01 : 26 : 12, 660 > 01 : 26 : 17, 814 we mightn't like each other but we're all in the same boat .
i've searched my instruments and can't find the pliers .
there's only the three of us .
if they find them on someone , know who'll get it?
me .
shall i report it and have them turn the place over?
i can't do it .
but ...
look out !
commandant , sir .
three patients and one doctor present !
x ray essential ...
so what is this i hear blaschke? what x ray?
i reported that machaty sustained a head injury .
i was worried about a brain haemorrhage .
you know how he did it?
yes .
he fell against the stove .
and that's precisely what you'll write in your report .
sir , permission to speak?
speak , if you must .
as machaty's former superior officer
i urge you to permit an x ray .
son of a bitch , back at work on monday .
sharp !
flying officer mrtvy is probably dead? " you can't say that !
he's " missing in action " and " presumed dead .
that's better .
perhaps " good " instead of " brave " . why? well , they say he was scared .
maybe .
but he flew all the same .
that's why he was brave .
i'd like to talk to you , karel .
there's something i want to say to you .
your superior officer is addressing you .
behave accordingly !
i want to apologize to you , in front of all present , for accusing you of firing at me .
i was bloody stupid .
you saved my life when you shot down that messerschmitt and i'm grateful .
i respect you and regret any pain i've caused you .
i'd be glad if you could forgive me .
and stop drinking and staying up all night .
you fly exhausted and senselessly risk your life .
do you accept my apology?
let it go , karel .
shake hands , you clowns .
to , captain otakar mrtvy of squadron ,
dear captain ,
we regret to inform you that your brother , bedrich mrtvy , is missing in action and presumed dead .
it happened on 23rd september during combat with the enemy ,
he was a brave pilot ,
he will remain in our hearts forever .
a little well , made of stone in an open field stands alone ,
keep moving .
keep moving .
and then we began to escort the americans ,
karel moved quarters ,
his only words to me in 3 months were " yes sir " on the radio ,
i wrote begging him to forgive me ,
but a wounded soul heals slower than a wounded body ,
what's wrong , franta?
my engine's conking out .
i'm about to take a swim ,
see you , boys .
red two , stay with him and report your position ,
karel is with him , sir ,
roger ,
is anyone listening !
take a fix on my signal , you idiots !
shit !
go home , karel .
you'll run out of juice .
what are you doing , you fool !
my instruments are in such a mess !
thank you , gentlemen .
my idea of getting out of here ...
they put me up to it .
they wanted to pin something on you so they could beat you up .
what was in it for you?
i'd get out earlier .
the best thing about all this is , you're not such a bastard .
barcha?
don't you know me?
come here ...
hello .
franta?
they said that ... that you were dead .
so you see ,
i'm not .
don't cry .
no one's to blame .
you are beautiful .
let's go , barcha .
thanks for looking after her .
barcha !
she's our dog !
really?
barcha , come here !
barcha , come home .
stay then , barcha .
don't be sad , franta ,
karel , is that you?
sure ,
where are you?
behind you , where i've always been ,
2430 czechoslovakians served in the royal british air force during the second world war .
