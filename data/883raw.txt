y eah , yeah .
well?
okay , they'll be out within an hour .

what happened to you today?
i don't understand you , jackson .
you read poetry books and history books for fun ... and you make the worst grades in two states .
you didn't even try to make up the midterm you missed .
don't you want to graduate?
don't much matter .
