lf you want , take a shower .
there are clean towels in the bathroom .
this is walter .
leave a message , wait for the beep .
will , pick up .
i'm not dumb enough to come back "
walter finch .
" will .
will dormer , what are you doing?
i try to help and you're running around like a maniac .
were you gonna kill me?
how would you explain that?
no one gets too upset when child murderers are brought in feet first .
there's no evidence i killed kay .
you know because i told you .
" come on .
what's wrong with you?
guess i'm a little cranky .
lack of sleep .
" get some rest , will you?
got some pills , and my bed's nice and comfy .
another night up and you'll lose it .
hallucinating , babbling .
tomorrow when you feel better , we'll meet in public .
we'll sort it out .
there's a ferry north of nightmute .
i'll be on the 11 : 00 .
and before you leave , could you feed the dogs?
they're on a diet .
dormer?
fax from the lab .
weapon was a . 38 smith & wesson .
we found something that might  i found this .
at the connells '.
and?
it's the author of the book we found in kay's bag .
it's signed by the author .
he's a local .
kay had all his books .
we should check it out .
small stuff , right?
yeah .
sure , sure .
nice work , ellie .
she's got sharp eyes , huh?
you bet your ass she does .
good stuff .
what a view .
i'm not who you think i am .
no?
lousy writer .
lonely freak .
murderer .
no?
when i was 7 , my grandmother took me to portland .
we were walking along and two guys snatched her purse .
a police officer came to ask questions .
he stood the whole time .
uniform looked brand new .
shoes , badge were polished .
it was like a soldier , only better .
i respect your profession .
i write about it .
i wanted to become a cop after school .
i couldn't pass all the tests .
you should've tried internal affairs .
they'd have taken you .
what do you want from me?
after kay died , i knew everyone would think i meant to do it .
so i cleaned the body , removed all evidence connecting it to me .
except for your fucking novel .
you don't always see the wood for the trees .
you , for one , should have figured that out by now .
when i heard they had brought somebody from l. a. , i panicked .
i knew the locals would connect me to kay eventually .
i could handle them .
they never look in the eyes of a killer .
killing changes you .
you know that .
it's not guilt .
i never meant to do it .
it's like awareness .
life is so important .
how could it be so fucking fragile?
you'd see it right away , wouldn't you?
you trying to impress me?
because you got the wrong guy .
killing that girl made you feel special .
but you're not .
you're the same pathetic freak i've been dealing with for 30 years .
know how many of you i caught with your pants down?
i never touched her like that .
you wanted to .
now you wish you had .
best you could do is clip her nails .
now you're so different .
you don't get it , do you?
you're my job .
you're what i'm paid to do .
you're about as mysterious to me as a toilet is to a plumber .
reasons for doing what you did?
who gives a fuck?
motivations are everything , will .
what did you see through the fog?
i saw pretty clearly , didn't i?
i saw you take aim ...
forget it . ... shoot your partner in the chest .
i heard him say , " get away from me ! " why?
anything to do with internal affairs investigation?
all that tension in your department?
you think i'm that easy?
i'm saying that's how it looks .
maybe even how it feels .
how did it feel when you found out it was hap?
guilt?
relief?
suddenly , you're free and clear .
did you think about it before that moment?
what would it be like if he wasn't there anymore?
doesn't mean you did it on purpose .
you figure if you got something on me , then i'll just roll over?
protect my reputation?
no .
protect your life's work .
the scumbags you put away will be back on the street before you go on trial .
with hap gone , you're free and clear .
why mess with that?
kay connell .
remember her?
it's your choice .
think of all the other kay connells .
do the math .
you're a pragmatist .
you have to be because of your job .
this isn't easy , but i want you to understand ... ... we're in the same situation here .
you didn't mean to kill hap any more than i meant to kill kay .
but that's hard for them to believe , so that's why we need each other .
we gotta find a patsy for the connell case and make it stick .
then you go back to los angeles and i can go back to living my life .
so , what do you need from me?
what do they know about me?
they found a signed copy of one of your books at kay's house .
so you'll be brought in for questioning .
at the station?
that's what they usually do .
brought in for questioning .
i can write that easily .
calm down .
it's no big thing .
it's preliminary inquiry , so ... ... just tell the truth .
tell them about randy  why are you talking about randy?
talk about your relationship with kay .
you can't hide it , so just say it .
randy is none of your business .
it's not your affair .
shouldn't i tell them she was unhappy
tell them she was unhappy , but let them find randy themselves .
that way , they'll make it stick .
understand?
we need a wild card .
a wild card?
yeah .
something that's there .
something we can use .
it's in every good detective novel .
you still have the . 38?
no .
really?
that's a shame .
we could use that .
that'd be very convincing for them .
this is my stop .
dormer !
wild card !
night , everyone .
night , francis .
working some overtime?
nice .
cracking some big cases?
night .
night , guys .
this is always the worst time of night for me .
too late for yesterday , too early for tomorrow .
sorry about the tape .
i had to make sure you'd follow through .
i'll follow through .
i've been thinking it over .
i should tell them about randy .
i think that's a bad idea .
" but he's the patsy .
he deserves it .
you should have heard the shit kay told me .
but these are cops .
they're not children .
you don't throw things like that in their lap .
i'll push them toward randy .
when the time is right .
we don't have the gun .
how will we convince them he's guilty?
did you keep the dress?
the dress?
kay's dress , nail clippings .
what did you do with those?
that's great .
the dress .
we could use that .
even better than the gun .
where could he have taken her?
" where'd you take her?
she died in the cabin , right?
yeah .
where'd you take her to clean her up?
don't think about that .
this is tough enough for you .
it was an accident .
yeah .
i didn't mean to kill her , you know .
i know , but what happened?
she called and said that she and randy had had a fight .
she wanted to come over and talk , and i said , " meet me at our place .
that's the cabin at the beach .
she comes over .
she's distraught and a little drunk .
she starts telling me about how randy and tanya were carrying on .
i only wanted to comfort her .
hold her .
i kissed her , and got a little excited ... ... and she started laughing at me .
she wouldn't stop laughing .
ever had someone laugh at you when you're like that?
vulnerable .
laughing their ass off?
someone you thought respected you?
you ever have that happen?
i just wanted to stop her laughing .
and then , you know ... ... i hit her .
couple of times , to stop her .
get a little respect .
randy did it all the time .
she liked it when he did it .
she never blamed him .
never wanted to leave him .
i do it , she starts screaming .
she wouldn't stop .
she's screaming .
i put my hand over her mouth .
then i'm really scared .
i'm scared shitless .
more scared than i've ever been .
i'm more scared than her .
and then ... ... everything was clear .
there was no turning back .
and after that , i was calm .
real calm .
you and i share a secret .
we know how easy it is to kill somebody .
that ultimate taboo .
it doesn't exist outside our minds .
i didn't murder her .
i killed her , but it just ended up that way .
so where'd you take the body?
thanks for listening to me .
feels good to talk about that stuff .
i'll be able to sleep now .
you wanna talk about hap?
morning .
your phone isn't working .
i turned it off .
i needed to sleep .
sorry .
fred called that author .
he was happy to cooperate .
he'll be in first thing , so we need to get to the office .
i forgot to tell you they sell these in stores in anchorage .
no way of finding out who bought it .
okay .
bet you're looking forward to getting back to l. a.
back to robbery homicide , or ... ... maybe not .
what are you saying to me , ellie?
nothing .
are you doing okay?
you haven't been sleeping much .
no , i haven't .
no .
a good cop can't sleep because a piece of the puzzle's missing .
a bad cop , because his conscience won't let him .
you said that once .
i did?
sounds like something i'd say , don't it?
i'll see you back there .
in what regard were you and her familiar?
how did you know her?
she was an avid reader of my novels .
when did you meet her first?
a year ago .
she came to a signing in nightmute .
she hung around afterwards .
we chatted about my writing ... ... and how she wanted to write ... ... then she asked if she could visit me and talk about books , things like that .
and she did?
yeah , we became very close .
she got comfortable enough to show me her writing .
what does she write?
poetry , actually .
any good?
no , not really .
you tell her that?
why would i?
exactly what was the nature of your relationship to this girl , finch?
i was someone she could talk to .
someone outside of her everyday life .
that's why she needed me and approached me .
why'd she need you for that?
well , her boyfriend , randy  randy stetz?
abusive little prick .
he hit her .
we know all this already .
it was getting worse .
so?
a lot worse .
really .
why all this eagerness to talk about randy?
you're right .
i'm sorry .
that's probably all hearsay .
i don't want anything i say taken the wrong way .
anything you say to us at this stage is in confidence .
secondly , we're not a bunch of hotheads who'll draw crazy conclusions .
okay .
please , continue .
one more thing .
probably doesn't mean much , but i think kay was scared .
i have myself to blame for that .
why is that?
randy knew who i was .
he knew that she had a friend ... ... someone she confided in .
it made him furious .
she wrote about being scared .
her letters were getting desperate .
you still have these letters , by any chance?
i probably do .
do you think it might help?
they might .
okay .
anything else?
the thing that worried her the most was the gun .
he had this old handgun .
he showed it to her .
i don't know where he got it , probably wasn't even his ... ... but he said he'd use it if he found out who she was seeing .
he kept it hidden in a heating vent .
you know , in the skirting boards?
it might be the . 38 .
get me judge biggs .
what?
i'm getting a search warrant to randy's .
get judge biggs on the phone .
i should get over there .
no !
no?
you're the guy he's talking to .
so we're waiting for the warrant .
okay?
do you know when randy showed her the gun?
february?
no , probably january .
why didn't you come forward when she died?
she didn't want anybody to know .
even when she was dead?
beaten to death .
her body dumped on a pile of garbage !
i was her friend .
no !
acquaintance .
we were close  close?
she was attractive .
did you have sex with her?
she was 17 .
seventeen?
she was attractive .
i suppose .
suppose?
she was .
so did you have sex with her?
no , i was her mentor .
you bought her things .
gifts .
yes .
what kind of gifts?
books , mostly , that's what she loved .
books?
what about this?
you give her this?
yes .
why?
to see how she looked with it on?
no .
no?
why jewelry?
it was just a present .
bought a lot of presents?
dresses?
what's wrong with that?
nothing .
i'm figuring out what kind of mentor you were .
i gave her things she couldn't have .
you wanted to fuck her , didn't you?
sick son of a bitch !
cool off .
sick bastard .
you have to cool down .
okay?
cool down .
all right .
i need a break .
i have to apologize on behalf of my colleague .
he's been under a lot of pressure lately .
but he's a good cop .
i'd hate to see the bad cop .
search and seizure warrant .
yes , sir .
randy stetz .
we got our warrant !
thank you .
we appreciate it .
francis , come with me .
let's go !
you're not going?
no .
are you not on the connell case?
i'm covering the shooting of detective dormer's partner .
heard about that .
should i call about kay's letters?
yeah .
i'll pick them up .
stetz !
we're coming in !
turn the place over .
look there !
try over there !
rich , look here now .
i got it !
hey , fred !
just in time , dormer .
had it in the motor oil .
what the fuck is this?
he says he was with tanya when kay was killed .
that's what she told me .
when?
when i questioned her .
were you planning on telling us?
that's what i'm doing now .
randy and tanya were screwing around .
she's trying to protect him .
and the gun?
says it isn't his .
if we get the ballistics match , he'll be forthcoming .
leaving?
first thing tomorrow .
if spencer can remember where he parked the plane .
i thought you wanted to kill me in the interview room .
randy is in jail .
said i'd write an ending they'd like .
you were wrapped up in details .
the details?
he's innocent .
no , he isn't .
he beat kay .
one day he'd do something worse .
you knew i planted the gun?
you wanted to help me before the tape recorder .
you had to have a wild card .
you're a good man .
i know that , even if you've forgotten it .
when were you gonna point them at me?
when you found kay's dress?
where i took the body?
if you have a gun and forensics ... ... wouldn't matter what i said about you killing your partner .
may i have the tape?
did you make any other copies?
why would i?
stop me from turning you in .
or killing you .
i don't have a hold over you .
you made choices .
like i wasn't here .
why kill me?
it won't help randy .
after your scene at the department , it won't do you good if i'm dead .
a lot of ways a man can die .
like an accident?
like hap .
like kay .
it took you 10 minutes to beat kay connell to death .
ten fucking minutes .
you calling that an accident?
it took you a fraction of a second to kill your partner .
is that more of an accident?
is this an accident?
if you want it to be .
it's over , walt .
it's over .
i'm telling them everything .
tell them about hap , you , everything .
what good would that do?
it'll end this thing .
it won't end it .
you're not thinking straight .
will you tell the truth?
you shot your partner and lied about it .
to them , you're a liar and a killer .
you're tainted .
forever !
you don't get to pick when you tell the truth .
the truth is beyond that .
that tape was the only proof we had a conversation outside of that room .
to them , i'm a writer that kay admired .
randy is the killer , and you're a hero cop .
your life's work is intact .
another abusive scumbag is in jail .
everything is as it should be .
go back to los angeles .
the case against randy is pretty solid .
i can take care of everything here .
i got it worked out .
go home .
midnight of your sixth night .
you broke my record , will .
randy stetz .
he was an asshole .
you knew him as a kid?
dads were on the same boat .
bad seed .
how do you like our beer?
what dormer needs is a little shuteye .
white nights getting to you?
hasn't been easy .
better than winter .
got that right .
sun barely comes up for five months .
like being sucked into a black hole .
hey , nancy drew .
you hear?
we got him .
rich found the gun .
something's on her mind .
i found this on the beach .
what is it?
shell casing , 9mm .
the murder weapon was a . 38 .
none of us carries a 9mm .
or backup weapon , right?
get a hobby , would you?
it's a legitimate point , isn't it , detective?
this case is closed , ellie .
hold the fort , boys .
i'll go find a men's room .
relieve myself of your fine alaskan beer .
do you want a beer or something?
no , thanks .
he's good people , right?
don't get carried away .
what has two thumbs and loves blowjobs?
i don't know .
this guy .
it's been something , dormer .
it's been really great working with you .
run will to the airport?
i gotta pick up the letters .
in umkumiut
at his lake house .
dormer will have to leave my car at the dock .
lf that's okay with you?
yeah , it's fine .
it's been a pleasure .
get some sleep .
detective dormer .
what is it?
someone's complaining about the noise .
says he can't sleep .
something wrong?
it's so fucking bright in here .
no , it's dark in here .
will you please ...?
there's this guy , wayne dobbs , 24 .
works part time at a copy store .
every day he watches this 8 year old boy ... ... waiting for his carpool across the street .
this is one of your cases?
yeah .
hap and me .
a year and a half ago .
for six months , he watches this kid .
he goes down , grabs that boy before the carpool comes ... ... takes him back to his apartment ... ... and keeps him there for three days .
he tortures him ...
... and makes him do things .
and , finally , he's had enough .
he gets a rope .
he hangs the boy in a storage space in the basement of the building .
but he didn't do it right .
little boy's neck didn't break , so he dangled there for a while ... ... and then died finally from the shock .
landlord found the body five days later .
the second i met this guy , dobbs , i knew he was guilty .
that's what i do .
that's my job .
i assign guilt .
you find the evidence ... ... figure out who did it , and then you go get them and put them away .
this time there wasn't enough evidence .
and it's reasonable doubt to a jury ... ... because a jury never met a child murderer before .
but i have .
anyway ....
i went and took some blood samples from the boy's dead body ... ... and i planted them ...
... in dobbs 'apartment .
i could feel it there .
this is gonna catch up with me .
i don't do things like that .
so how did it catch up with you?
internal affairs is coming down on our department .
hap , he was gonna cut a deal ... ... and bring me straight into it .
they would've reopened dobbs 'case , he would've walked .
now that won't happen .
and i don't know ... ... how i feel about that .
but dobbs was guilty .
dobbs needed to be convicted .
so the end justifies the means .
right?
i'm in no position to judge .
why not?
two kinds of people live in alaska .
the ones who are born here , and the ones who come here to escape something .
i wasn't born here .
why don't you tell me what you think?
here .
now .
in this room .
you and me .
please .
i guess it's about what you thought was right at the time .
then , what you're willing to live with .
" nightmute police department .
detective burr .
she's not here .
she left town " about 20 minutes ago to go pick up "
mr. finch .
detective burr .
are they friendly?
yeah .
didn't expect to see you this soon .
sorry about the mess , doing some work .
could kay's letters strengthen the case against randy?
possibly .
watch your head .
i've done it 1000 times .
sorry about all the clutter .
i am a pack rat .
i keep everything .
i got them .
just don't know where .
they've gotta be here somewhere .
working on a new book?
have you read any of my books?
i haven't .
she knows , will .
where is she?
she knows you killed hap .
you would've realized if you weren't strung out .
the way she looks at you  where is she?
it's under control .
lf anything happened to her
she's okay .
if she talks , you're fucked .
everything you've worked for is destroyed .
now give me  show me where she is .
now .
she's okay .
listen .
i mean , it's all fine .
let's search this place .
for the dress .
what dress?
ellie's ....
kay's !
you're rambling .
ellie's here .
i'm taking care of us .
us?
she saw the dress .
us?
where'd you get us?
don't talk about us .
she's alive , will .
ellie !
hold it !
don't move !
you shot detective eckhart .
and finch saw you do it .
did you mean to shoot hap?
i don't know anymore .
i don't know .
i couldn't see him through the fog , but when i got up close ... ... he was afraid of me ... ... and he thought i meant to do it , so maybe i did .
i just don't know anymore .
where's your gun?
he took it .
keep your head down .
i got seven rounds in this clip .
make it last .
head down .
okay , go !
go !
you forgot the wild card .
detective dormer !
i called for backup .
they'll be here soon .
dormer , just hold on .
hold on .
nobody needs to know .
you didn't mean to do it .
i know that even if you don't .
no , don't .
don't .
what?
why?
don't lose your way .
hang on .
dormer .
let me sleep .
no .
just let me sleep .
