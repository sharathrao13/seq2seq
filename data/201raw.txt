you know what they can do to you?
yes , mother .
you are not safe .
you may be directing this movie , but what you're asking , we can't do .
don't tell me it can't be done .
the gyro forces are too much .
you send these planes into barrel rolls ... ... they won't make it .
it's the climax of the picture .
make it work .
decrease the vertical trajectory if you have to .
a le rhne rotary won't stall at 60 degrees .
we're still short two cameras .
we need to cut that sequence down ... we're not cutting .
i'll get those cameras .
set up for rehearsals .
i'm noah dietrich .
your office said i'd find you here .
dietrich .
you're a man on the come .
i read your rsum , talked to your references .
know what i'm looking for?
you're looking for a second in command at hughes tools .
someone to oversee the financial aspects of the business .
i'm looking for somebody to run it and do a good job .
there's only one thing you've gotta know .
my folks , they're gone now .
so it's my money .
what i do with that money may seem crazy to those sons of bitches in houston .
i'm sure it does , but it all makes good sense to me .
you got that?
got it .
good .
now , you made , what , $5200 a year at your last job?
i'll pay you $ 10, 000 .
i guess i'll be working twice as hard .
you'll be working four times as hard .
i just got you at half price .
welcome aboard .
thank you .
you're my voice now .
make them understand that .
some of those folks still call me junior .
you tell them it's " mr. hughes " now .
you bet .
so when do we go to houston?
we don't .
cholera epidemic in 1913 .
two thousand dead .
whole place is nothing but pestilential swamp .
typhus , malaria , cholera , yellow fever .
you name it , they got it .
you see that , mr. dietrich?
you are looking at the largest private air force in the entire world .
what do you think of that , now?
it's your money .
start them up !
i saw the rough cut of the new tod browning movie , <i>london after midnight . </ i>
lon chaney is incredible .
it's his best performance in a long time .
it's gonna be a big hit .
the cards are great .
it's supposed to be ...
hello , mr. mayer .

yes .
i was wondering if i could have a moment of your time .
i need a few cameras .

i bought every camera i could find .
we're shooting our big dogfight sequence .
i need two more .
desperately .
you think mgm could help me out?

cameras .
oh , with the actual cam ... we're not usually in the practice of helping out competition .
no .
no .
so how many cameras do you have now?
twenty four .
you ...?
wait a minute .
you have 24 cameras?
that's right .
and you need ...?
you need two more?
yeah .
you don't think you got it with 24?
no .
no , sir .
you know , i think ...
i think we've got them all ...
don't we have them ...?
they're all used , right?
all 26 of them .
i only need two , sir .
jesus christ , sonny .
howard .
howard .
let me give you a little advice , huh?
take your oil money ...
drill bits .
all right , take your drill bit money and put it in the bank .
if you continue making the movie the way you are ... ... there isn't gonna be a distributor ... ... you won't find anybody who wants to see the movie ... ... and you're not gonna have any more oil money .
so welcome to hollywood .
yeah .
well , i'll be sure to remember that , mr. mayer .
good luck .
all right .
he needs 26 to make it work?
he's out of his mind .
i looked down at my pants .
it was a strange situation .
boss .
scram , love boat , let's go .
another soda .
you know what i mean .
milk .
in the bottle .
with the cap still on .
okay , what did his highness say?
son of a bitch won't part with a single goddamn camera .
why don't you try and make do with what you have .
what i have isn't enough , john , not for how i see it .
look .
my name depends on this picture .
if it doesn't work , i'm back to houston ... ... making goddamn drill bits for the rest of my life .
can't you do it with the cameras you have?
you ought to hear about what's going on with demille .
he's shooting his bible picture .
he's gotta do a crucifixion in fresno .
johnny .
a bunch of tractors ...
johnny .
you're a press agent , are you not?
yeah .
you're supposed to know the ins and outs?
absolutely .
do you?
yeah , absolutely .
then you leave the big ideas ... ... to me .
oh , yeah .
of course , boss .
cigar , cigarettes , sen sen?
i thought you were at the brown derby ... ... with trixie .
no , theresa .
margaret .
margaret .
exactly .
what happened to margaret?
she lost her ...
thank god that's settled .
oh , i'm sorry .
thelma , this is howard hughes .
howard and i were discussing how he wants me to pull a camera out of my ass .
cigarette?
oh , no , thanks .
i don't smoke .
boy , you are just hitting on all six cylinders , aren't you?
my god .
would you do me a favor and just ...?
would you just smile for me one time?
just once?
yeah .
yeah .
you see , you got a short upper lip .
makes for a much nicer smile .
see , i wonder what gives a beautiful woman like you pleasure .
i mean , say you're just standing there , right?
and i just touch you .
just ...
just like this .
with my fingertips .
do you ...?
do you like that?
do you?

<i>rumors coming from a lonely airstrip</ i> <i>out in van nuys . </ i>
<i>sources whisper that young</ i> <i>texas industrialist howard hughes ... </ i> <i> ... won't stop pouring money</ i> <i>into his war epic . </ i>
<i>and do we mean epic ! </ i>
<i>one hundred and thirty seven pilots, </ i> <i>87 airplanes ... </ i> <i> ... 35 cameramen , 2000 extras . </ i>
<i>how long will it be before this picture ... </ i> <i> ... ends up costing as</ i> <i>much as the real war? </ i>
damn it .
why the hell do they look so slow?
this isn't what it was like up there .
they look like goddamn models !
son of a bitch .
howard?
without something standing still behind the planes ... ... we've got no idea of how fast we're moving .
we got no sense of relative motion .
call ucla .
get me the best meteorologist they got .
you get him here in an hour , all right?
hey .
you want the good news or the bad news?
bad news , always .
all right .
we installed the 450 radial .
struts won't take the vibration .
minute we fire her up , the struts start cracking at the attach points .
well , what's the good news?
there isn't any .
goddamn it , odie .
if the 450's too big , we figure something else out .
we've done everything .
we've rebuilt her from top to toe .
if we drain the fuel tank ... ... she might make 180 miles per hour .
i want minimum 200 , all right?
i want a date with theda bara .
that ain't gonna happen .
oh , don't be so sure .
if the struts won't sustain the engine we need , we gotta get rid of the struts .
no , then the top wing falls off .
then let it .
what?
who says we need a top wing?
i mean , who says we need anything?
a monoplane .
a cantilevered monoplane , right?
they're doing it in france .
to hell with the top wing and struts .
a 550 wasp engine .
one hundred octane fuel .
that would give us a horsepower of what?
seven hundred .
we squeeze that to a thousand , we got the fastest plane ever built .
you know , i've gotta say ... ... we've already spent over $200, 000 rebuilding this plane .
to hell with it .
tear it up , odie .
go on .
well ...
the cumulonimbus formations about which you speak ... ... that look like ...
giant breasts full of milk .
i want clouds , damn it .
yes , clouds ... ... that look like giant breasts full of milk ... ... cannot exactly be guaranteed for any particular occasion .
so you might have to ...
to wait .
then we'll wait .
look , whatever they pay you at ucla ... ... i'm doubling it , all right?
you work for me now .
find some clouds .
find some clouds .
find me some clouds !
welcome to <i>hell's angels</ i> .
thank you .
i've been to chatsworth , santa cruz , encino , san diego ... ... riverside , van nuys and bakersfield .
it has been eight months !
where are my goddamn clouds , huh?
they move , mr. hughes !
clouds move .
that's what they do .
they move !
you see that?
it is costing me $5271 a day ... ... to keep those planes on the ground .
you find me some goddamn clouds , huh?
nice day .
yeah , very funny .
i got a call from houston .
they're getting nervous .
stop showing them the damn bills .
that would be illegal .
shit , no .
maybe it's a little bit naughty .
hughes tool is incorporated in texas .
they have to see the bills .
incorporate a new division out here .
we'll call it hughes aircraft .
do we need these rivets on the cowling?
yeah , or the reverse thrust would rip it off .
they're gonna give me drag .
do something about that .
wind resistance on rivets?
i want her slippery .
there are tax consequences to incorporating in california .
just take care of it , would you?
mr. hughes !
oakland !
we have clouds in oakland !
you mean it this time?
yes !
goddamn it , yes .
i can promise you .
clouds in oakland .
all right , don't get all jittery now .
oakland !
oakland !
we're going to oakland !
oakland .
down and to the left !
that's perfect !
that's right , senator george .

no .
i don't remember anything from reel 10 .
i don't know what reel 10 is .
i'm a businessman , howard .

now , look .
this has been a great ride .
we've had a hell of a lot of fun .
but you're losing $25, 000 a day doing this .

so , what are my options?
well , this time i don't know that you have any .
i'm afraid you gotta close it down .

a lighter shade .
i don't want to look like boris karloff .
if you know what i mean .
i read in the magazines that you play golf .
on occasion .
well , how about nine holes?
now , mr. hughes?
if it would be convenient , miss hepburn .
you're not extending enough on your follow through .
follow through is everything in golf , just like life .
don't you find?
saw your <i>scarface</ i> picture .
violent .
realistic .
movies are movies , howard .
not life .
now the stage .
the stage is real .
real flesh and blood .
human beings right out there in front of you , buster .
can't look away .
can't munch popcorn .
that would be rude .
do you like the theater?
no .
oh , i adore the theater .
only alive on stage .
i'll teach you .
we'll see some ibsen .
if the republicans haven't outlawed him by now .
you're not a republican , are you?
how did you vote in '32?
well , i didn't .
you must !
it's your sacred franchise .
heard you were wooing ginger rogers .
what about that?
she's just a friend .
men can't be friends with women .
they must possess them or leave them be .
it's a primitive urge from caveman days .
it's all in darwin .
hunt the flesh , kill the flesh , eat the flesh .
that's the male sex all over .
excuse me?
well , if you're deaf , you must own up to it .
get a hearing aid .
or see my father .
he's a urologist , but it's all tied up inside the body , don't you find?
me , i keep healthy .
i take seven showers a day to keep clean .
also because i am what's so vulgarly referred to as " outdoorsy .
i'm not outdoorsy .
i'm athletic .
i sweat .
there it is .
now we both know the sordid truth .
i sweat and you're deaf .
aren't we a fine pair of misfits?
three .
noble effort .
so i suppose you're wooing me now?
oh , well .
not enough .
not enough .
these rivets have to be completely flush .
i want every screw and joint countersunk .
i want no wind resistance on the fuselage .
she has got to be clean , odie .
clean .
understand?
okay , howard .
i don't know what else to tell you .
what do you got for me?
the thing is , twa needs a new plane .
a modern plane .
oh , yeah?
what kind of plane?
okay .
the dc 3 has 21 daytime seats ... ... and 14 overnight berths .
something bigger?
try 50 seats with a ceiling of 12, 000 feet .
no .
no , 20, 000 .
think about it .
what does 20, 000 feet give you?
less turbulence .
because it's above the weather .
jack , we wanna fly above the weather .
only 1 percent of the american population has set foot on an airliner .
why?
because they're scared to death .
they should be .
i mean , 7000 feet is bumpy as shit .
you know that .
we build a plane that flies above the weather ... ... we could get every man , woman and child in this country to feel safe .
an airplane with the ability to fly into the substratosphere across the country .
across the world .
now that is the future .
you with me?
yeah .
i don't wanna get into this if your board doesn't have the balls for it .
would they support us?
i don't know .
what's your financial picture?
not great .
last year's deficit?
770, 000 .
what's it selling at?
about 8 dollars a share .
that's the lowest it's been , huh?
i could do that .
do what?
buy it .
you wanna buy the airline?
for crying out loud ... ... we don't want pencil pushers getting in the way of us making our plane .
give me brass tacks , now .
what does controlling interest in twa cost me?
call it 15 million .
that is a chunk of change , huh?
you call noah dietrich .
you have him start buying .
howard , hold on .
are you sure?
you wanna think about it for five minutes?
hell , jack , i got a tiger by the tail here .
i ain't gonna let it go .
good evening , mr. hughes .
welcome .
your table is ready .
how goes the aviation?
oh , just fine , pete .
i'm so glad .
good evening , mr. hughes .
madame .
it's " miss .
miss .
the usual , mr. hughes?
please .
may i recommend for the lady ... ... our clementine soup followed by roast duck with currant glaze ... ... and poached pears in rose sauce .
it's truly divine .
yeah .
that sounds fine .
your kind of joint , is it?
wouldn't have thought .
they're open late .
i go to a hot dog stand on la cienega too .
they're open till about 4 .
are they?
how marvelous .
howard !
howard !
hi !
son of a gun .
kate , this is johnny meyer .
i suppose you could call him my press agent .
pleased to meet you .
loved <i>alice adams</ i> .
you're too kind .
i'm sure you know errol , right?
mr. flynn .
yes .
kate .
kate .
kate of the clenched jawed hepburns .
enchanting as always .
you should use lux on your hands , by the way .
i do .
you and howard ought to cook up a picture .
costar with errol .
i could sell that in spades .
that would be marvelous .
howard?
i think not .
don't you read <i>variety</ i> , mr. meyer?
well , i'm box office poison .
i'm on the outs , the skids , the doldrums .
washed up , day old fish not worth the eating , so they tell me .
hell with them .
hell with them , my dear .
soulless pricks to a man , right?
johnny tells me you're thinking about doing a western , of all goddamn things .
are you making a western , howard?
yeah .
making a western .
i'm gonna call it <i>the outlaw</ i> .
yeah .
and you know what it's about?
s e x.
it's all about s e x.
it's a western .
you can't have fornication in a western .
it isn't done .
it's not real sex , it's movie sex .
what <i>scarface</ i> did for the gangster picture , <i>the outlaw</ i> will do for the western .
put the sex and guts and blood up there on the screen .
have you seen my cigarettes?
don't mind us .
new york cut steak , 12 peas , bottle of milk with the cap on .
you can't afford your own cigarettes?
jack has all my money .
i hope your food isn't getting cold at your table somewhere or something .
no , no .
we're here all night .
don't worry .
now , howard .
now , howard .
if you're seriously talking about putting carnality ... ... back on the silver screen , you must swear to let me in on the casting session .
i have an eye for talent .
isn't that right?
you ought to give up prancing in tights ... ... be a talent scout .
that prancing paid for my new yacht .
you must all come sailing with me .
catalina .
what do you say?
catalina .
sounds grand .
yeah .
i've even managed to coax ... ... the luscious miss de havilland and her equally luscious sister to come .
though i fear their mother will insist on coming , to preserve their questionable virtue .
we shall assault these twin monuments of pristine britannic beauty nonetheless .
what do you say , howard?
yeah?
yeah .
yeah .
yeah?
i gotta go .
if you'll excuse us , we have ... we have to be somewhere .
you are somewhere , howard , you madman .
somewhere else .
excuse us .
charmed , gentlemen .
do help yourself to the poached pears .
i hear they're divine .
well .
howard hughes , ladies and gentlemen .
was that meant for me?
my hero .
god , all that hollywood talk bores me silly .
as if there aren't more important things , like mussolini .
where are we going , by the way?
do you feel like a little adventure?
do your worst , mr. hughes .
think you own this place , you limey bastard?
i'm a tasmanian bastard , you prick .
thataway , errol .
let me at him !
that's mr. mayer's house right there .
do you know where jack warner lives?
what's that on the steering wheel?
cellophane .
if you had any idea of the crap that people carry around on their hands .
what kind of crap?
you don't wanna know .
hold on to the wheel for a bit .
that's too hard .
relax your hand .
relax your hand .
you see , you gotta feel the vibration of the engine through your fingertips .
do you feel that?
yes .
well , that's good .
golly !
well , she's all yours .
where are you going? !
i think there's some milk back here .
you just keep us steady , now .
all right .
howard .
yeah?
there's a rather alarming mountain heading our way .
pull back on the wheel a smidge .
go on .
golly !
i don't think i've ever met someone who actually uses the word " golly .
you all right?
do you want me to take over?
just when i'm getting the hang of it?
you want some milk?
oh , please .
utterly smashing !
we'll do it again .
i'm free wednesday .
it's a little early for golf , though .
oh , no , no .
i live right there .
feel like a drink?
lead on .
now , that makes for a challenging par four .
my decorator picked out the wallpaper and such .
he's queer as a bedbug .
but i just hate this room .
gives me the willies .
like i'm about to be swallowed up by the latest issue of <i>town</ i> & <i>country</ i> .

my study .
take me there .
