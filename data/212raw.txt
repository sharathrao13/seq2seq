you know the problem with hollywood?
they make shit .
unbelievable , unremarkable shit .
i'm not some wannabe filmmaker . . . . . . searching for existentialism through a haze of bong smoke .
no , it's easy to pick apart bad acting , shortsighted directing . . . . . . and a moronic stringing together of words the studios term as prose .
no , i'm talking about the lack of realism .
realism .
not a pervasive element in modern american cinematic vision .
take dog day afternoon , for example .
arguably pacino's best work .
short of scarface and godfather part i , of course .
masterpiece of directing , easily lumet's best .
the cinematography , the acting , the screenplay , all topnotch .
but . . .
. . . they didn't push the envelope .
what if , in dog day sonny wanted to get away with it?
really wanted that .
now this is the tricky part .
what if he started killing hostages right away?
no mercy , no quarter .
meet our demands or the pretty blond gets it in the head . " bam , splat .
what , still no bus?
come on .
how many innocent victims would it take for the city . . . . . . to reverse its policy on hostages?
and this is 1966 .
there's no cnn .
there's no cnbc .
there's no internet .
fast forward to today .
present time , same situation .
how quickly would the media make a frenzy?
in hours .
it would be the biggest story from boston to budapest .
ten hostages die .
twenty , thirty .
relentless .
bam , bim .
one after another .
all on hi def , computer enhanced .
you can almost taste the brain matter .
all for what?
a bus , a plane?
a couple million dollars that's federally insured?
i don't think so , but . . . . . . just a thought .
i mean , it's not . . . . . . within the realm of conventional cinema , but . . .
. . . what if?
there's a problem with that movie .
really?
it wouldn't work .
how come?
audiences love happy endings .
pacino escapes with the money .
boyfriend gets a sex change .
live happily ever after .
no?
no .
homophobia .
bad guy can't win .
it's a morality tale .
one way or the other , he's gotta go down .
well , life is stranger than fiction sometimes .
you know , guys , i gotta go .
gotta jet .
thanks for the coffee .
stan .
time to go to work .
you coming?
move .
i won't say it again .
i have a clear shot .
shooters , stand by .
okay .
now what?
don't worry , folks , it's almost over .
is she done?
she's done .
move her out .
don't worry , you'll be fine .
you'll be back before you know it .
turn the fuck around .
rescue team , let's go .
who's on the roof?
all shooters , you are holding for command .
you're doing good .
behave yourself .
look over there , and there .
all prepare their shot .
what are you doing?
i'm handling this !
don't fuck with this guy !
you'll get these people killed !
we got two teams on the roof .
we got a team over there .
double this team up .
that's your best angle .
don't talk .
just listen .
each of the 22 hostages is wrapped with 20 pounds of c 4 explosives .
they're also taped with 15 pounds of stainless steel ball bearings .
which makes them the world's largest claymore mines .
they got the green light .
i got this guy on the phone !
i'm done playing with this asshole !
around their necks are radio frequency electronic dog collars .
dog walks out of the yard , gets the shit shocked out of him .
same here .
this bank is their yard , so don't fuck with me .
johnson , you and your partner move up between those vehicles .
stand down !
get back !
get back !
officer , stand down now !
he's gonna shoot !
he's gonna shoot !
shit .
get her !
go !
no !
release the hostage !
no !
release the hostage !
she's gone .
take cover !
no , no !
let her go !
let her go !
release the hostage !
help me !
let her go .
let her go !
jesus .
shit !
you guys , come on !
how long will you be here?
one week .
business or pleasure?
hopefully both .
what type of work do you do?
i'm a consultant .
excuse me .
could you be careful with that?
that's expensive equipment .
how long will this take?
a few minutes .
sit down , relax .
i'll be right back .
a few minutes , huh?
hey , where's he going?
it's going up .
stairs .
sir , could you please?
easy , easy .
this better be important .
wouldn't have asked you otherwise , senator .
we just received word that axl torvalds was intercepted entering the u. s.
when was this?
within the last two hours .
according to my fbi source , he was nabbed in customs at lax .
they know he's working for us?
it's unlikely .
it was a routine check .
torvalds freaked out .
they got lucky .
this ain't good .
what do the feds know?
nothing yet .
he's refusing to speak english .
the finnish consulate has contacted the state department .
so we haven't been compromised?
i'm not sure .
i'm working on that .
you better get sure because someone's cock will end up on the block . . . . . . and it won't be mine .
i understand , senator .
there you go .
well , well , well .
who are you supposed to be?
i'm ginger .
ginger , huh?
where's gilligan?
for someone the nsa once listed as the most dangerous hacker in america . . . . . . you sure don't look like much .
surprised?
i know everything about you , stan .
what are you selling again?
my employer wants to meet you .
shit .
you're not too good at golf .
you're fucking up my chi .
let me have that .
this is not a nice place you got here , stan .
here 5 minutes , and i already feel sorry for myself .
you're wasting your time .
i touch a computer , i go back to leavenworth .
do not pass go , do not collect $200 .
if i knew you were coming , i might have cleaned up .
i'm not here to suck your dick , stanley .
he'll pay you just to meet you .
i gotta go to work .
right .
great work greasing pump jacks .
so . . . . . . spoke to holly lately?
shit !
hello?
melissa .
is holly home?
why are you calling here?
i just want to talk with holly .
it's saturday .
she's at soccer .
it's illegal for you to talk to her .
don't do this , mel .
it's not good for holly .
how would you know what's good for my daughter?
you spent the last two years in prison .
mel .
stop calling me that , stanley .
look , i just . . . .
i just want to see my baby .
well , she doesn't want to see you , stanley .
and i swear , if you try to contact her . . . . . . i'll have you thrown in a hole so dark . . . . . . leavenworth will seem like two weeks in vegas . . . . . . during which i will personally . . . . . . pay two skinheads to make a playground out of your ass .
you can take the girl out of the trailer park ... . . . but can't take the trailer park out of the girl .
i will not let myself be manipulated by you , stanley .
larry's her father now .
larry's the porn king of southern calif
larry is a film financier .
the films he chooses are for profit and none of your business .
get help .
get into a program , get a therapist , get a dog .
but whatever you do , stay away from my child .
your child?
she's our child .
she will never be your child .
forget holly .
what are you still doing here?
look , i'm beginning to lose my sense of humor .
then i'll cut to the chase .
if you want your daughter back , you better listen up .
unless you want to stay here in this loser existence . . . . . . while your daughter grows up to be a fluffer in her new daddy's videos .
please don't confuse your own childhood with my daughter's .
and look at your situation , stanley .
for the past 20 months , you've been in and out of court 6 times?
each time your case was thrown out .
situation doesn't look good , sweetheart .
how much money would it cost to hire the best family lawyer in the country?
a lot .
come here .
come here .
judas .
that should get you started .
hundred grand .
what do you got to lose?
he just wants to meet you .
one time .
you don't like the situation . . . . . . walk away .
and that's it?
that's it .
and you keep the money .
what did he say?
all right , look , look .
your client is wanted on 24 counts of electronic crimes . . . . . . in 6 different countries .
he has a finnish passport .
these allegations are not recognized as crimes .
your laws don't apply .
do you see a finnish flag hanging on the wall , ikea boy?
what did he say?
he said ikea is swedish .
he understands english , huh?
let me talk to him .
he's all yours .
you're fucked up now , hamlet .
the thing is , they have you put the furniture together yourself .
my client has reserved his right not to answer any questions .
why would the best hacker in the world . . . . . . risk life imprisonment by coming into the continental u. s.?
okay , what did he just say?
he never misses an episode of survivor .
did he really say that?
you're funny .
how much do you weigh?
how much do i weigh?
we'll call you if we need you .
eat a dick .
wipe that smile off your face .
a year ago , i was head of the largest cyber criminal task force in the world .
but i burned out .
i snapped .
i shot a suspect in the hand .
you know how difficult it is to work a keyboard with one hand?
you don't understand .
whatever you want to do to me , he'll do worse .
i'm already dead .
my only chance is back in europe .
i have friends there .
tell me what i want to know .
you'll be on the first thing smoking .
first class .
courtesy of the u. s. government .
who is he?
i don't know his name .
you work for him .
you don't know?
tell me something .
i'll tell you what i know .
he exists in a world beyond your world .
what we only fantasize , he does .
he lives a life where nothing is beyond him .
but you know what?
it's all a facade .
for all his charm and charisma , his wealth , his expensive toys ... ... he is a driven , unflinching , calculating machine .
he takes what he wants , when he wants ... ... and disappears .
so how do i find him?
you don't find him .
he finds you .
here's how it works .
his people pick me up .
take me to him .
he tells me what he wants me to do .
i do the job right there .
i get paid , and i leave .
that's a really nice story , but you haven't told me shit , have you?
excuse me , sir .
you have a call .
take a message .
it's assistant director joy .
he said it's important .
i can only tell you what i've done for him .
well , that's a start .
thank you .
you've just let my client go free .
you denied his right to counsel  excuse me .
yeah , and you eat the dick !
yes , i got a call from a. d. joy .
this is roberts .
hold for just one moment , sir .
joy .
yeah , roberts .
you needed me .
you didn't call?
no , roberts .
what do you want?
you should've let me buy you a suit , stanley .
i'm happy with what i'm wearing .
ignorance is bliss .
miss me?
stanley , gabriel .
big stan .
nice suit .
thanks .
they say the clothes make the man .
you buy it?
hope not .
drink?
i flew 1500 miles for this meeting .
how about we get to the point?
no .
actually , you flew 1500 miles for 100 grand .
but that's not the point .
helga .
meet stanley .
hello , stanley .
helga .
look , i don't have a lot of patience , gabriel .
maybe you can help me with something .
take a look at this .
you know i can't touch that .
do you like tequila , stanley?
this is bullshit .
you want something from me , and i from you .
dod d base , 128 bit encryption .
what do you think?
impossible?
nothing's impossible .
good .
maybe slide in a trojan horse hiding a worm?
is this an interview?
sort of .
marco .
give him some incentive .
hey , what are you doing?
relax , stanley .
i have been told that the best crackers in the world . . . . . . can do this in 60 minutes .
unfortunately , i need someone to do it in 60 seconds .
you're kidding .
afraid not .
go .
get up , get up !
fifty five .
get on with it .
what the hell is this?
time's a wasting , big guy .
oh , jesus .
forty five seconds .
oh , she's good , isn't she?
what's going on here?
jesus christ .
more time , more time !
come on , stan !
twenty .
nineteen .
fifteen .
come on .
ten .
nine .
three .
two .
one .
too bad .
you gotta die .
no , wait !
i was just fucking with you , stan .
that's our guy .
get away from me .
i really want to help you , stan .
like you helped me in there?
that was a test , stan .
a test .
and you passed .
i don't know why i let you talk me into this .
you're saving your daughter .
i'd do anything for her , but if i end up in a box or in jail . . . . . . then i really can't help her .
i'm taking my money and going back to court !
with your little $100, 000?
melissa will throw $500, 000 back at you .
think !
i'm thinking that you'll put a gun to my head just to see if i can
i can't pee in front of an audience .
let me break it down to you , stanley , one last time .
you live in a trailer .
you're a felon .
you work a dead end job .
and you desperately want your daughter back .
gabriel is your only shot .
take it .
i'm concerned about our new friend .
oh , now , don't be jealous .
i don't see him dragging his sorry ass over the finish line .
thought we lost you .
tell me what the deal is .
the deal is that we're having a little gathering at the house .
come and i'll explain it to you there .
gentlemen , if it's not good news , don't say it .
actually , we have a ray of hope in the darkness of your life .
when we grabbed torvalds at the airport , these two guys were there .
check this out .
recognize those two same guys , a few hours later .
and then . . .
. . . guess who shows up .
stanley jobson .
wired magazine's 1996 man of the year .
a burnout now , but the hacker zeitgeist then .
yeah , i know jobson , i arrested him .
why are you in l. a. , stan?
his ex wife and daughter live in malibu .
the new husband owns backdoor films , a shady porn production house .
the production value's good , considering that they shoot on video .
his wife is in some of the videos .
i know .
she's like an actress .
that's great .
are you done?
who's the girl?
actually , sir , we don't know yet .
she's a serious piece of talent .
man , she's way out of his league .
find out who she is .
sit on the ex wife's house .
you got it .
stanley , you want to get wet?
i don't have a suit .
you don't need one .
come on , stan .
later .
some view .
let's get a drink .
pool lights on .
so how did you do it?
do what?
break the code .
i dropped a logic bomb through the trap door .
no , you didn't .
you didn't have time .
what'll you have?
scotch .
you can do better than that .
i used a password sniffer .
how did you do it?
i don't know exactly .
i see the code in my head .
i can't explain it .
let me show you something .
pretty impressive , huh?
so , what we need from you is a worm .
a hydra , actually .
a multiheaded worm to sniff out digital footprints across an encrypted network .
what kind of cipher?
a vernam encryption .
the key code is destroyed upon implementation .
and it's a true 128 bit encryption .
well , actually , we're talking a 512 bit .
that's definitely not possible .
what if i give you 10 million dollars?
that would cover all your problems .
yes?
unless , of course , it's not possible .
but you think about it .
it won't bite you .
i promise .
this is not just a multi screen system .
it has a ds 3 connection .
we can access 6 different networks simultaneously .
it has a central encryption you have to crack to utilize the system .
try it .
it'll be hard without a gun to my head .
maybe i should put a gun to your head .
i thought you were gabriel's .
i'm not what you think i am .
ginger .
you surprised that a girl with an iq over 60 can give you a hard on?
so is it impossible?
nothing's impossible .
good .
so we have a deal .
morning .
you mean afternoon?
can i borrow your car for something?
sure .
there you go .
thank you .
hey , stan , if you're going to see holly . . . . . . i suggest you re evaluate the way you look .
just a thought .
just a thought .
come on , mom , pick up .
mom late again?
she'll be here in a minute .
hi .
can i have the phone number for yellow cab?
need a lift?
daddy !
oh , what are you doing here?
i missed you so much .
oh , i missed you too , baby .
i brought you something .
oh , my gosh .
it's so cute .
oh , dad .
if mom finds out , she'll have you thrown in jail .
it's okay , baby .
you want a lift home?
of course i do .
come here .
all right .
you are heavy .
nice car .
hey , thanks .
is that mommy's car?
is she home?
that's my step dad's car .
so listen to me .
i found a way for us to be together .
i don't want anything to happen to you .
everything's going to be fine .
everything's going to be okay .
just trust me .
i love you , daddy .
i love you .
come here .
oh , god .
you go home .
okay?
bye .
i miss you .
i miss you too .
go .
oh , sweetheart .
hey .
come here .
it's okay .
go .
go .
go .
who the hell are you?
a friend of a friend .
shit .
oh , fuck .
fuck !
hold it !
stanley !
go !
oh , fuck .
oh , fuck !
don't move !
don't move .
come here .
look at this .
what were you running for?
you arresting me?
for violating your parole by leaving texas without permission?
or evading an officer and almost getting me killed in the process? !
no , i'm not arresting you .
then why are we talking?
what are you doing in l. a.?
vacationing .
vacationing , right .
the judge is allowing you to see your daughter?
fuck you .
fuck you?
oh?
you just want to get right down to it?
okay , fine .
i can help you with your daughter .
you help me , i'll help you .
you'll have to forgive me .
the fact that . . . . . . you put me in jail doesn't inspire trust .
you put a virus in an fbi program and set it back two years .
they were reading isp subscribers 'e mail .
it was illegal .
i did what the judges wouldn't do !
you broke the law !
we both did what we had to do .
and your program is back in full swing .
nice trip down memory lane , but if you aren't arresting me
not getting a lot of cooperation here .
i ran into your friend torvalds the other day .
he was vacationing too .
what are the odds of you being in l. a. at the same time?
i'm just a sucker for disneyland .
we done?
good .
tell torvalds i said hello .
you can tell him yourself if you're not careful .
he's dead .
give me a card .
you think of anything to say , call me .
sorry about your nose .
you're in way over your head .
i know .
you want me to watch him?
yeah , set it up .
i've had a shitty day so far , but i think it just got worse .
either shoot me , or tell me why you're wearing that wire .
can't do that .
who are you , ginger?
i can't tell you .
who are you?
he'll kill me if he finds out .
that's not my problem , is it?
you're asking for a lot of faith without giving me any .
you brought me into this mess .
i deserve to know who's playing me .
who are you?
i'm dea , stanley .
holy shit .
we're after gabriel .
give him the worm . . . . . . take the money and get out of here .
that's all .
this looks friendly .
you know me , i'm a friendly girl .
come on , stanley .
let's get coffee .
here you go .
thank you .
ever heard of operation swordfish?
no .
then you'll appreciate the irony .
triple espresso .
two .
okay .
in the '80s , the dea set up a network of dummy corporations . . . . . . as a front to launder drug money and gather evidence .
but these companies started to make a lot of money .
in 1986 , when it was terminated , $400 million was in these accounts .
money that just sort of disappeared .
it didn't disappear .
it sat , earning interest .
that's 15 years ago .
you know how much money that is today?
nine and a half billion .
this is a sweet deal .
we go in over the phone lines , pop the firewall . . . . . . drop in the hydra and wait for the money .
aren't you getting ahead of yourself?
to access the cluster , you need a bank on the backbone of the network .
know how long that'll take to find?
not a problem .
look behind you .
cheers .
these fellows might wear armani . . . . . . but they have the swagger of ex military .
maybe bodyguards , but they look like mercs to me .
something's going on .
they have two ds 3 trucks .
that's serious bandwidth .
thermal scopes show a huge heat load .
could be mainframes .
the house was listed by celebrity estates .
it was leased two weeks ago by a blind corporation .
no other info on them yet .
wait a minute , joe .
blue shirt , pinstripe .
oh , yeah , that's him .
that's our man right there .
just in time to watch stanley find our worm .
in college , i created the source code for the worm i use .
in the basement is the only pdp 10 still active and on the internet .
not many people know it .
it's an its machine , kept online for historical sake .
i hid my worm there , where no one would ever look .
voila .
good man .
good man .
senator , we have a problem .
senator .
seems you're in a predicament .
is that right?
i don't follow .
download your file .
senator  you know where i got these?
from the deputy director of the fbl .
he thought i might be interested .
sir , do you think there is any aspect of this operation i am not aware of?
we are aborting the operation .
take a vacation .
a vacation?
have i ever failed you , sir?
that's not really the point , is it?
it's my point .
you're losing sight of our objective .
the risks are too great .
we'll seek alternative means of finance .
this operation is moving ahead .
everything is under control .
son . . .
. . . let's just say you've got a 200 pound rottweiler .
now , he loves you .
it's his job to protect you .
but if he bites you , you got to put him down .
can never tell who he might bite next .
you understand?
yes , i do understand , senator .
i think we got a team on the west coast .
fort mac arthur .
maybe they should pay our friend a visit .
come on .
network ip range .
confirmed .
please confirm .
confirm .
confirm .
we are cruising !
oh , yeah .
next .
and next .
too easy .
no , don't .
no , no , no .
yes !
three percent , please .
oh , fuck .
i'm fucked .
no , no , no .
fuck you !
shit , there's no fucking way .
i'm rusty .
rusty .
come on , come on .
okay .
time to disguise you . . .
. . . as an internal destruction .
quick , quick .
thank you .
return .
three , two , one , go .
come on .
come on .
yeah .
close .
yes .
oh , baby .
now i've just got to modify the code .
the bank's ids logs every packer . . . . . . that go to any port other than the 22 or 80 tcp .
holy shit .
okay , chateau attigue 1996 .
white , white .
nope .
come on , come on .
here we go .
twenty six .
ninety six .
nine
oh , shit !
what's the matter?
you look like you've seen a ghost .
we gotta talk .
let's take a drive .
can't we talk here?
we shouldn't .
ever heard of harry houdini?
he wasn't like today's magicians , only interested in television ratings .
he was an artist .
he could make an elephant disappear in a full theater .
you know how he did that?
misdirection .
what are you talking about?
misdirection .
what the eyes see and the ears hear , the mind believes .
what's going on?
we've got a tail .
hold on .
shit .
jesus .
jesus !
take the wheel .
what?
take the wheel !
holy shit !
who are those guys?
jesus !
what the fuck are you doing?
jesus !
drive , stan .
move !
i can't drive this thing .
learn !
move it .
come on !
hard left !
hard left !
keep going !
go !
get in the car .
not until you tell me what i'm involved in .
look , stanley , i like you .
you're on my good side .
but don't confuse kindness with weakness .
you have 12 hours to get the hydra .
so get in the car .
stanley , are you okay?
i just saw that maniac murder people in the street .
i'm fucking great .
you can't leave .
it'll all work out .
you gotta trust me .
trust you?
yeah .
you're dea , i got the feds up my ass and i don't know what's going on here .
if we don't find out who he works for , we'll have to start over .
that's not my problem .
i don't care who he works for .
what about holly?
do you give a shit about her?
finish the job .
we'll get your daughter back .
i promise .
ah , the great american outdoors .
yet i never understood the appeal of fly fishing .
a bit too much like masturbation for me without the payoff .
this is a catch and release stream , isn't it?
yeah , i believe it is .
you must see the irony in that , senator .
chairman of the subcommittee on crime fishing in a catch and release stream .
how could you do it to me , jim?
after all we suffered .
i've changed my identity so often i don't know who i am anymore .
how could you do it?
we were so close to our goal !
the fbi was watching you .
you tried to kill me .
you've misplaced your loyalty , senator .
you've sold out america .
patriotism does not have a four year shelf life .
but politicians do .
what are you doing with that?
thomas jefferson once shot a man for treason .
hold the phone .
thomas jeff
stan .
how are you?
fine .
finished?
is this stanley jobson , social security number 669547311?
i'm calling from credit suisse to notify you ... ... that $ 10 million was transferred into your new account .
as promised .
thanks .
so i'm done , then .
soon .
walk with me .
against my better judgment , i'm going to tell you who i am .
i know who you are .
do you?
i think you think i'm a bank robber .
but the truth is , i'm just like you .
like me?
no .
because you're a murderer .
that i am , and worse .
but i do have ethics .
rules i adhere to .
why are you telling me this?
well , if you listen , then you'll know .
you asked who those men were .
i'll tell you .
hoover started a secret organization in the '50s , called black cell .
to protect our freedoms .
i don't care .
all i care about is my daughter .
i'm talking about your daughter .
you , your daughter . . . . . . and 200 million americans who take their freedoms for granted .
i see .
you don't know what it takes to protect our freedoms .
that's my job .
to protect your way of life .
so you're really stealing all this money just to protect little old me .
that's right , stanley .
because wars cost money .
war?
who are we at war with?
anyone who impinges on america's freedom .
terrorist states , stanley .
someone must bring their war to them .
they bomb a church , we bomb 10 .
they hijack a plane , we take out an airport .
they execute american tourists , we nuke an entire city .
we make terrorism so horrific that it's unthinkable to attack americans .
you're not using the phone lines .
you're going into the bank .
and you're coming with us .
it'll all be over in 24 hours .
you're a rich man , stanley .
soon you'll be on a yacht with your daughter , eating bonbons .
the american dream .
you'll have done your small part in ensuring america's way of life .
you're a hero , stan .

how many people die is up to you !
i want that plane on the runway in 25 minutes !
he wants a plane on the runway in 25 minutes .
my suggestion , sir?
you give it to him !
he wants a plane?
i'll give him a goddamn plane .
finish the job .
not until i see my daughter !
you want to see her?
get him his daughter !
dad !
oh , jesus .
baby , are you okay?
it's okay , it's okay .
you son of a bitch .
you think i wanted it to come to this?
i'll sacrifice any lives i have to to protect this country .
including my own .
let her go .
and i'll get your money .
you finish the job , and you both go .

what happened , stan?
the explosion scrambled the internal clock .
no , it didn't .
you fucked me .
you kill me , you'll never get a dollar .
the money jumps every 60 seconds from one account to another .
it'll do so for the next 10 years .
it wasn't supposed to happen for another six hours , but hey .
fix it .
unfortunately , i can't .
the accounts are encrypted with a 1024 bit cipher .
even i can't get through the firewall .
let the hostages go and i'll tell you how to get the money .
we all walk away .
nobody gets hurt .
deal?
i'm thinking .
no deal .
get ginger .
move out .
what are you doing?
string her up .
no .
don't do this .
no !
wait , wait !
hey , stay still !
it'll feel real good .

you're insane !
fifty five .
okay , okay .
hope you built in a back door .
come on , come on .

keep your distance .
clear the air space for five miles .

what?
i know what you're thinking .
if that launcher was a suppository . . . . . . would that bad man stick it up my ass?
well , you eyeball me once more , boy . . . . . . i'll stick it so far up your ass . . . . . . you'll be begging me for this bullet .
this bus is your new holding area .
if you don't test your collars , this will all be over soon .
let's get this son of a bitch .
how can you justify all this?
you're not looking at the big picture .
you can cure all diseases , but the price . . . . . . is that you must kill one innocent child .
could you do it?
no .
you disappoint me .
it's the greatest good .
how about 10 innocents?
now you get it .
how about 100?
1000?
to preserve our way of life .
no man has the right to make that decision .
you're just a terrorist .
you're wrong , stanley .
thousands die every day for no reason .
where's your bleeding heart for them?
you give $20 to greenpeace thinking you change the world .
what country will harbor terrorists when they see the consequences?
did you know i can buy nuclear warheads in minsk for 40 million?
hell , i buy half a dozen , i even get a discount .
advise joy 20 minutes eta at the airport .
control , please let a. d. joy know we're 20 minutes from the airport .

all right .
let's do it .
okay , i need a team over here .
the rest of you , let's go outside .

jesus .
what the fuck is he thinking?
aren't we going to the airport?
misdirection , stan .
what are you doing?
where are you taking the thing?
you see sugarland express?
didn't like the way it ended .
pull over before you get
they can't be serious .
hold on !
attention control , this has now become an aerial pursuit .
i've also got people across the tarmac .
sir , i've just been informed that the bus is no longer en route to lax .

it broke through the vehicles . . . . . . and turned onto first street .
all right .
let's go .
sir , the bus is no longer on first street .
then where is it?
airborne .
what's he doing?
we have a strong wind condition .
tell him to climb !
climb , goddamn it !
climb !

everybody down !
add action or excitement , or change the direction of the entire campaign .
maybe we ought to rethink the visuals .
holy shit .
secure a perimeter around the building .
i want everybody out of this lobby right now .
secure the elevators and stairs !
anybody coming out , detain them !
what's going on?
the elevators to the roof?
up there .
and the freight elevator?
rear of the building .
that way .
stan man .
take care of your girl .
maybe i'll see you around .
no !
it's not going to end like this .
come on , stan .
not everything ends as you think it should .
besides . . . . . . audiences love happy endings .
stay here !
shit !
come on .
move , move !
no , stanley !
come on .
get him out of here .
secure that weapon .
let's go .
gentlemen .

the dentals match those the israeli government sent us . . . . . . for an ex mossad agent named gabriel shear .
excuse me , sir .
the dea has no record of any ginger knowles working for them .
i checked all the hospitals and morgues , and i can't find her body .
look again .
bodies just don't disappear .
right .
he could make an elephant disappear ... ... in a full theater .
you know how he did that?
misdirection .
i'm dea , stanley .
give him the worm , take the money and get out of here .
what the eyes see and the ears hear , the mind believes .
misdirection , stan .
this is a bad guy .
nobody's going to miss him .
you all right?
yeah , i'm good .
why don't you get out of here?
go see your daughter .
yeah , thanks .
we'll be in touch .
you son of a bitch .
thank you .
