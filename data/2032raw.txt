you were outside my house and now you're outside my office .
don't insult my intelligence by telling me that's a coincidence .
no , it's no coincidence .
do i know you?
my name is raymond price .
are you following me?
it's about anna , mr. rivers .
i've been receiving messages from her , from the other side .
from what other side?
jonathan ... your wife is dead .
i have proof .
she's been trying to communicate ever since the moment of her death .
look , mr. rivers , my son died when he was 12 .
for years i've been suicidal .
look .
just stay away from me .
but then someone told me what i have told you .
that my son , my dead son , had made contact .
and he had , mr. rivers , it was true .
from the other side .
and he was happy .
happy .
please .
yes .
and also at ease .
and it changed my life , mr. rivers , because then , then i knew .
so please , please , mr. rivers , put this in a drawer , hide it , forget about it , but please don't throw it away .
because , one day ... you will want to know .
my thoughts are with you both .
'it's anna rivers .
'the fabulous anna rivers carrying groceries . '
'stop it . ''how was shopping? '
'turn it off . ''ok .
just ...
'there's one of her best features . ''shut up . '
'that's a beautiful thing , ladies and gentlemen . '
'the body of internationally renowned author anna rivers
'was discovered last night by a security guard making a routine visit ... ''... to the disused pier 16 , three miles upriver
'from where her car was found abandoned
'five weeks ago on argyle avenue .
'the discovery brings to an end ... ''before she drowned ,
'your wife sustained injuries consistent with a fall onto the rocks by the river .
'the damage to the head , the break to the arm .
'when the tide came in , she would have been unable to help herself .
'she would have been swept upstream several miles .
'i'm so sorry for your loss . '
'divers recovered her personal effects .
'her cell phone was in her car , and we're returning it to you . '... giving her to us , her family and friends , to know and to love as a companion on our earthly pilgrimage .
give us faith to see in death the gate of eternal life , so that in quiet confidence we may continue our course on earth until , by your call , we are reunited with those who have gone before .
amen .
amen .
so , what do you think?
i love it .
yeah?
yeah .
it's nice here .
all right .
it's a fresh start .
i guess .
could you ...
could you take mikey for the weekend?
yeah , of course .
maybe ... maybe a little longer .
as long as you want , john .
we're gonna go lay the floor now .
when are you gonna bring them?
they'd like to see you this week .
sure .
fine , it shouldn't be any problem .
whoops .
you brought me here just to do that , didn't you?
no , i didn't .
let me see what i can do here .
this is where you tell me you're running over budget , right?
shit .
keep doing that !
i'm sorry , i didn't ...
ask them if they have a light .
you guys ok?
we are now .
yeah .
i trust you'll fix this before mr. cunningham arrives .
anna?
'jonathan . '
'you have one message .
'message received wednesday 23rd ,
'2 : 30am . '
'jonathan . '
'end of message .
you have no messages . '
'you have no messages .
'you have no messages . '
oh !
please , come .
how nice .
hello .
hi .
look , er ...
i was just about to finish with someone .
i can come back .
no , it won't take long .
i'm really glad to see you .
i was hoping that you'd come .
thank you .
this is sarah tate .
let me introduce you to mr. rivers .
sorry , i'm a little ...
we've had a breakthrough today .
it's incredible .
it truly is .
this is ridiculous .
stay awhile .
i should get these boxes back to the store .
sarah , there's no need to hurry .
make yourself a cup of tea .
i suppose .
thank you .
would you like one?
yeah , that'd be great .
thank you .
thank you .
mr. rivers , please .
oh , er ...
excuse me .
please , sit here .
sit .
so , have you heard of e. v. p. , mr. rivers?
no .
i'm not surprised .
those that have call us cranks .
e. v. p. stands for electronic voice phenomenon .
i'm listening .
well .
i'm not a clairvoyant , i'm not a medium ,
i don't contact the dead , the dead contact me .
and , with e. v. p. ,
i can hear them ,
i can see them , and ...
i can record them .
'...
i understand ... '
'... you shouldn't be ... '
and they are ...
that's right .
people that have passed over .
is this your job , or a hobby , or what?
i think obsession would be more appropriate , to be honest .
now , i wonder where ...
ah !
here we are .
they don't always appear visually the first few times .
we tend only to pick up their voices and people can find that frustrating .
but when it works , and you see the faces of the people that you're able to help , like sarah , nothing , believe me , nothing comes close .
mr. rivers , do you want to hear your wife?
yes .
'jonathan .
'jonathan .
'find him .
'jonathan rivers .
'find him .
'jonathan ...
jonathan ...
'rivers ...
'find him , please . '
the frustrating thing about e. v. p. is it's not live .
you need to make the recording and you'll only know if you've got results when you play it back .
here .
it has milk .
perfect .
thank you .
excuse me for a moment .
it's an amazing feeling , isn't it?
er ...
it's indescribable .
it took me a few visits to get used to it but it's addictive .
i'm here all the time .
he's really helped me .
i try to help him when i can , so i keep some of this stuff at the store .
what store?
i have a bookstore .
your wife was a wonderful writer , mr. rivers .
yeah .
so what made you come here?
my fianc .
he died eight months ago .
we've had trouble deciphering what he's been saying but this afternoon we cracked it .
only two words " sarah , yes .
because , before he died , he promised me that if it was like they say it is that he would find a way of getting to me and letting me know that he's happy .
so , " sarah , yes .
oh .
raymond thinks we probably won't see him again now but that's ok .
and i've heard what i wanted to hear .
anna ... this is john .
if there's any way you can hear me ... will you please let me know?
please .
just any kind of ...
just any kind of sign .
please .
'susie . '
'susie . '
'susie , i ... '
i recorded this a few hours ago .
it's quite faint , so i had to save it as a sound file on the computer to enhance the sound .
so , um ... she knows that i visited?
i believe so .
so will i get to see her this time?
no .
this will just be sound .
i'm sorry , john , we have to be a little patient .
trust me , john , this is just the beginning .
sit , here .
now ...
if you want to hear it again , just press that key .
i'll be back in a moment .
'tell him ... because i love him . '
'tell him ... because i love him . '
'bastard .
bastard . ' 'bastard . '
what was that?
it's ok , it's ok .
we do have some very bad people out there .
you just have to press that ... and they're all gone .
we've had a step towards visual contact with anna .
let's celebrate that .
here .
they can't all be nice , they can't all be anna .
'susie tomlinson ... smile . '
'susie tomlinson ... sm ... '
hello .
'lt's raymond .
something's happening . 'really?
'get over here . 'i'm on my way .
hello?
raymond?
so you'll tell me whatever you find out?
i can't tell you any more than you'll read in the papers .
yeah , thanks .
thank you for coming to the service .
it would've meant a lot to him .
oh .
thank you for doing this for me .
i'm not sure where to start .
he was working off a disk , so ...
maybe anna's original tapes might be in one of these boxes .
you all right?
i still can't believe he's gone .
well ...
maybe he'll be in touch .
i don't know .
said he'd made enough of a nuisance of himself when he was alive .
just doesn't make any sense .
he was helping people .
wow .
these go back years .
23 , to be precise .
carol should know .
tell thomas he should .
men in the room .
oh , here's one " 500 dollars still there .
that's the kind of message i like .
yeah .
there we go .
why do we got so many?
so you can watch your favorite show and i can watch my favorite show .
yeah .
ok ...
um ...
they're showing me something .
it's ...
it's , uh ...
willow avenue .
they're showing me willow avenue .
yes?
no .
no .
no .
oh .
ok .
it's no problem .
sometimes it happens .
your wife , she passed over recently .
yeah .
her passing was difficult .
yeah .
she was , um ...
she's a writer .
she was a writer .
yeah , her words are important .
oh ...
i'm sorry , the light is way too bright .
it's ... it's like these tiny , noisy , little pinpoints .
it's making it hard to see anything at all .
can you ...
it's electronic voice ...
i know what this is .
i've been making tapes ...
you shouldn't .
you shouldn't try this by yourself , it's not safe .
it's like homemade ouija boards and teenage sances at halloween .
e. v. p. is not good .
we spend years developing our relationships with our guides so that we can protect you .
from what?
from the ones who like damage .
cos they are out there and they will find you .
if you're gonna keep insisting on meddling , then ...
anna , my wife , she sent me a sign .
no .
no .
not anna .
you are misreading everything .
listen , it is one thing to contact the dead , it is another to meddle , and you are meddling .
i just came cos i wanted some help .
i know , i can help you .
it's just that they are urging me to tell you to stop .
right .
thank you .
mr. rivers ...
willow avenue .
are you sure?
they keep showing me willow avenue .
no .
no willow avenue , no willow street , no willow terrace .
mr. rivers .
she was pregnant .
yes?
'we play every day . '
'he says you are happier now . '
'did i die? '
'susie .
'susie tomlinson ... 'smile .
'susie tomlinson .
'smile '
excuse me .
are you susie tomlinson?
yeah .
my name's jonathan rivers .
hi .
may i speak to you?
my mother died giving birth to me .
and my grandmother , she tried for years to make contact with her .
you know , with candles , darkness and smoke ...
sances?
yeah .
all of that , she tried everything .
she used to tell me ... that when she died she'd let me know if she found her , if she ... if she found my mother .
whenever i was sad , she nagged me to cheer up .
she would say , " susie tomlinson , look on the brighter side .
susie tomlinson , lighten up .
susie tomlinson , smile .
they've found each other .
haven't they?
that's what she wanted me to know .
it's like she didn't really die .
i get the call from my father and then , what , like two days later you come by?
it's like she just carried straight on .
susie , i don't understand .
i've been getting messages from your grandmother for a week .
no , that can't be .
she just passed away two days ago .
'they are ruling nothing out in the case of missing mother of two , mary freeman .
'lt's been nine days since she left her house ... '
where are we gonna eat now?
on our laps .
there you go .
it works .
what's that , dad?
that means it's time for us to go pack up your gear .
come on .
one , two , three ...
hoi !
that's it .
next week , can i watch a video and you watch a video like you said?
yep , but only if you're good , and ready for when your mom comes to pick you up .
ok .
daddy .
yeah .

thanks again .
yeah .
ok .
mr. black .
john ...
mr. black .
uh ...
this is gonna sound strange but i need to tell you .
i went to willow avenue because she reached out to me , she asked for help .
that's the thing .
she wanted help .
i am grateful for what you did , mr. rivers .
my son wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you .
so thank you .
but now i'd like you to leave us alone .
mr. black ...
carol may have believed your bullshit but not me .
so you and your sick friends , you stay the fuck away from me and my family , you understand?
you stay away .
number one , they're not dead .
when i see them , they're not dead .
she shows me things that haven't happened .
things that haven't happened?
right .
number two , she's showing me things that are here , not somewhere else where i can't do anything .
she doesn't show me an earthquake in india or some bomb in the middle east , they're here in this city where i can maybe do something .
i've seen things that haven't happened yet .
you understand?
i can see how you're putting it together .
putting it ...?
putting it together?
what do you mean?
she wants me to help .
i couldn't help carol black .
but i can help them .
'jonathan rivers 'office . 'karen , cancel my appointments
for the next few days .
'are you all right? '
i need a few days .
'take care of yourself . 'yeah , i will .
'it hurts . '
'stop .
'she's ours . '
'she's ours . '
'john , my love . ''willow avenue . '
'stop , you pig .
willow avenue . '
it's the same voice .
when i was at raymond's , he had been receiving messages , angry , violent messages .
now i'm getting the same thing , sarah .
but from whom?
i don't know .
sarah .
edith tomlinson , 207 .
i was getting messages from susie tomlinson's grandmother .
she was trying to reach her dead daughter , susie's mother .
edith tomlinson .
daughter died giving birth , tapes 200 to 208 .
susie's grandmother .
she was visiting raymond .
probably just a coincidence .
look for carol black , the woman in the car .
remember what her husband said?
my wife might have been into that shit but i wasn't .
carol black .
general interest , tape number 231 .
raymond had lists of clients .
you've seen only two .
i've seen hundreds of faces .
it could be the same with all of them .
i'm in there , you're in there , edith , carol , they're just two people ...
there's too much else .
it's a coincidence .
mary freeman .
the missing woman .
she's on my tapes .
i've seen her .
she's on my tapes .
first they visit raymond .
then i see them .
then they die .
what are you doing?
if she's alive , anna will show her to me .
we don't know that everyone you see is alive .
susie's grandmother , carol black .
what about anna?
anna's different .
she's helping me .
we don't know what's happening here .
i do .
if mary freeman's on these tapes , she might be alive and we might be able to save her .
sarah !
sarah , come here !
look at this .
come here .
come here .
look at this .
hear that?
that's her .
oh , my god .
she's alive .
'go .
go now . '
go where , baby?
john ...
anna , go where?
'please , john .
go ! '
go ... go where , baby?
'go now ! 'go where?
go where?
damn it !
she's gonna die .
you don't know that .
she's on the tape .
she's on the tape .
she's gonna die .
'john .
'john .
'lt hurts . '
oh , my god .
oh , my god .
what if i don't wake up?
you will .
i promise you will .
you will stay with me?
sure .
sure .
promise?
promise .
thank you .
sarah?
god .
it's as much as we can say .
there's a 30 , 40 % chance she might pull through .
let's hope she's ok .
thanks again for your help .
mr. rivers .
neighbors say they saw you on the balcony when miss tate fell .
is that true?
i was trying to stop her .
from falling?
well , she was on the balcony .
any idea why she was on the balcony?
i don't know .
i don't know .
all right .
i'll give you some time but we'll need a full statement from you .
are you heading home soon?
i'm not leaving town , if that's what you mean .

'damage to the head , the break to the arm ... '
anna !

# last time i talked to you
# you were lonely and out of place
# you were looking down on me
# lost out in space
# laid underneath the stars
# strung out and feeling brave
# watch the riddles glow
# watch them float away
# down here in the atmosphere
# garbage and city lights
# you gonna save your tired soul
# you're gonna save our lives
# turned on the radio
# to find you on satellite
# i'm waiting for the sky to fall
# i'm waiting for a sign
# and all we are
# is all so far
# you're falling back to me
# the star that i can't see
# i know you're out there
# somewhere out there
# you're falling out of reach
# defying gravity
# i know you're out there
# somewhere out there
# hope you remember me
# when you're homesick and need a change
# i miss your purple hair
# i miss the way you taste
# i know you'll come back some day
# on a bed of nails i wait
# i'm praying that you don't burn out
# or fade away
# and all we are
