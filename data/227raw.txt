yesterday ...
december 7 , 1941 ... a date which will live in infamy ... the united states of america ... was suddenly and deliberately attacked ... bynavalandair forces ofthe empire ofjapan .
it is obvious ... thatplanningthe attack beganmany weeks ago .
duringthe interveningtime ... the japanese government ... has deliberatelysoughtto deceive the unitedstates ... byfalse statements ... and expressions of hope for continued peace .
the attackyesterday on the hawaiianlsiands ... has causedsevere damage toamericanmilitaryforces .
iregretto teilyou ... thatover3, 000americanlives have beenlost .
no matterhowlong itmay take us ... to overcome this premeditated invasion ... theamericanpeople , in their righteous might ... wiilwin through to absolute victory .
because of this unprovoked , dastardly attack by japan ...
i askthatthe congress declare a state of war .
ls ittrue ... men are still trapped alive inside the arizona?
we can heartapping from inside the hull .
we're doing everything we can to getto them ... butthey're fortyfeet below water .
we've been trained to think thatwe're invincible .
andnow ourproudestships have been destroyed ... by an enemy we considered inferior .
we're on the ropes , gentlemen .
that's exactly why we have to strike back now .
we'll attackthe marshall and gilbert lslands , sir .
i mean hitting the heart of japan the way they have hit us .
mr. president ...
pearl harbor caught us unawares because we didn'tfacefacts .
this isn'ta time forignoringthem again .
we have long range bombers , but no place to launch them .
midwayis too far , andrussia won'tailow us ... to launch a raidfrom there .
admiral?
navy's planes are small .
they carry light loads and have a short range .
we'd have to getthem within afew hundred miles of japan .
we'd risk our carriers , and if we lose them ... we'll have no shield against invasion .
does anyone in this room thinkvictory is possible ... withoutfacing danger?
we are atwar .
of course there's a risk .
but considerthe risk , mr. president .
lf the japanese invade us right now ... they would reach chicago before we could stopthem .
gentlemen ... most of you did not know me when i had the use of my legs .
i was strong and proud ... and arrogant .
now i wonder , every hour of my life ... why god put me into this chair .
butwhen i see defeat in the eyes of my countrymen in youreyes, rightnow
i startto thinkthat maybe he brought me down ... fortimes like these ... when we all need to be reminded who we truly are thatwe will not give up or give in .
admlral : mr. president , with ailrespect, sir ... whatyou're asking can't be done .
mr. president !
get back , george !
get back .
do nottell me ... it can't be done .
narrator : japan continues its military conguest ... throughoutthe pacific .
but, backhome ... miilions ofamerican workers bandtogether ... bringingfactories to iife to avenge pearlharbor .
mr. president, we have an idea how to bombthe japanese .
sir , it's risky ... but it's bold .
who are you?
i , sir?
captain low , mr. president .
he's a submariner .
he came upwith this idea .
i like sub commanders .
they don't have time for bullshit , and neither do l .
fire away , gentlemen .
andwhere is godin aii this?
ourenemies believe a divine windprotects them .
butwe see ourfriends iaidouthere before us .
hey , captain .
lieutenants rafe mccawley , daniel walker .
yes , major?
you're both going stateside .
fly out in two hours .
whatfor , sir?
ask colonel doolittle .
yes , sir .
you're packing .
orders .
what kind of orders?
the top secret kind .
the dangerous kind .
i can'tfind danny .
ls thatwhy you're here?
lookingfor danny?
probably saying good bye to his squadron .
we've been assigned to doolittle .
i wasn't lookingfor danny .
i couldn't have you go away ... withoutyou understanding something .
yeah .
you don't have to explain anything .
ido, because you're acting iike ididn'tlove you .
evelyn , loving you kept me alive .
i should've died overthere .
when i was in thatwater , i made a deal with god .
i told him i was sorry ... that i knew i'd been afool for leaving you ... trying to go overthere and be a hero ... and i promised i'd never ask for anything again ... if i could just see you one more time .
and you know what?
ltwas worth it .
you kept me alive , evelyn .
you brought me home .
so i'm gonna stand by my end of the deal .
i'm gonna walk away .
and i won't askyou for anything .
but i justwantto know why .
justtell me that, will you , please?
justtell me why .
rafe , i'm pregnant .
oh , my god .
i didn't even know until the day you turned up alive .
and then all this happened .
i haven'ttold danny .
i don'twant him to know .
all he needs to think about ... is how to do this mission and get back alive .
rafe , all i everwanted ... wasfor us to have a home , grow old together ... but life never asked me what i wanted .
now , i'm gonna give danny my whole heart ... but i don'tthink i'll ever look at another sunset ... withoutthinking of you .
i'll love you my whole life .
i'll see you on board .
you know, the only thing that scares me ... is thatyou might love him more than you love me .
i love you , danny .
and i'll be here waiting foryou when you come back .
follow me .
colonel .
congratulations on your promotion , sir .
i heard whatyou did .
we can explain that , sir .
explain what?
whatever it is you heard about us , sir .
you mean the hula shirts you wereflying in?
orthe seven planes you shot down?
you're both being awarded the silver star ... and promoted to captain .
ls thatthe good news , sir , or ...
you're just about the only pilots in the army ... with combat experience .
i need youfor a mission ...
i've been ordered to puttogether .
you know whattop secret is?
yes , sir .
it's the kind of mission where you get medals .
butthey send 'em to your relatives .
top secret means you trainfor something ... never done before in aviation history ... and you go without knowing where you're going .
you do it on that basis or not at all .
i'll go , sir .
i'll go, too , sir .
by the way, the brits sent overyour personal effects .
thankyou , sir .
there's only one more thing .
leave your goddamn hula shirts at home .
evelyn : dearrafe ...
it's so strange to be this farfrom you ... butyoushouldknow this everynight ...
i've been looking all overforyou .
danny, this ... this ain't no time to leave things unsaid .
now, we gottafacefacts here .
thefact is, we just both love the same woman .
she's thefirst girl i ever feltthis way about , rafe .
i couldn't helpwhat happened any more than you could .
this is different , though , danny .
evelyn already lost the man she loved once .
i just don'twant itto see that happen to her again .
guys like us got no choice .
this is war .
she knows that .
danny , don't do this .
don't go on this mission .
you got nothing to prove .
you've been protecting me since we were kids .
yeah, well ... you do tend to need it from time to time .
the mission i'm asking you to volunteerfor ... is exceptionally dangerous .
take alookatthe man beside you .
it's agoodbet thatin the nextsix weeks ... you or he ... will be dead .
everyone brave enough to acceptthis ... stepforward .
yourgrandmother couldtake ab 25 off ... on a mile long runway .
well , i'm gonna train you to do it in 467feet .
because at468feet ... you're dead .
and once you get it up ... you'll learn tofly it like afighter ... thirtyfeet off the ground .
i wantyou to say hello ... to lieutenantjack richards , navy aviation .
he'llhelp us iighten these fatladies .
dumpthat ashcan .
dumpthat ashcan .
see that bomb sight?
get rid of it .
colonel , he's crazy !
the lady'sfat !
listen to him .
she'sfat .
we want a skinny lady !
max power !
get up , get up !
damn !
how the heck
damn !
they just keep rolling pastthat line .
maybe it's a bad idea .
no, they're too heavy .
we gotta get drastic .
this armored plating goes .
i'm sure , i'm sure .
lose it like a skirt , son .
release brakes !
come on , come on !
god !
put every man on the line !
let's show these boys how this thing is done !
come on !
max power .
well , if he can do it ...
weil, gentlemen , nowlcan teilyou ... thatwe're going to tokyo .
and we're gonna bomb it .
that comes as a special request ... directlyfrom president roosevelt .
the navy'll sneak us about 400 miles off the coast ... and we'll launch from the carrierthere .
has that been done before?
taking army bombers off navy carriers?
no .
ok .
any other questions?
well , sir , is it even possible to land ... a b 25 on an aircraft carrier deck?
thatwon't matter .
as soon as we're airborne , the carrier headsfor hawaii .
butwithoutthem , where do we land?
i have a phrase i wantyou to memorize .
wo shimeiguo ren .
it means " i am an american " .
ln chinese .
ain't gonna be any easier .
that's threefeet shorter than our practice runway .
fellas?
sir .
sir .
secretary of the navy gave me these .
what are they?
friendship medals the japanese gave us ... when they were pretending to want peace .
what'll you do with them?
wire them to the bombs and give them back .
so what's going on?
well , sir , we only have sixteen planes .
so?
when the japs hit us , they had more than 300 .
how much difference can we make?
it's notthatwe're afraid , sir .
butwe might die , and we wantto know what it'sfor .
you know , at pearl , they hit us with a sledgehammer .
this raid , even if we make itthrough ... it'll only be a pinprick ... but it'll be straight through their hearts .
victorybelongs to those thatbelieve in it the most ... and believe in itthe longest .
we're gonna believe .
we're gonna make america believe, too .
colonel? ineedaminute .
excuse me , majorjackson?
yes?
do you remember me?
oh , sure i do .
i'm sorry .
i've been meaning to thankyou .
well , maybe you can .
when the news comes in aboutthe doolittle boys ...
i wantto be in the command post .
i'm sorry .
i don't know whatyou're talking about .
how the hell do you know aboutthis mission?
let's call it an inadvertent disclosure .
someflyboy you're dating shot his mouth off .
actually , it's abouttwo pilots .
i know they're going into great danger .
i justwantto be there when the news tells us ... if they've lived or died .
most officers would have thrown you in the brig .
most nurses wouldn't keeptheirfingers ... plugged in your artery .
i can't promise you anything .
gooz : hey, red , you thinktheypickedus ... to do this 'cause we're younganddumb?
come on , gooz , we're the tip of the sword .
ln honor of ourtripto japan ...
igotus some victory cigars !
yeah !
there you go .
putthatin yourinsidepocket , nextto yourheart .
you know, jack , we may lose this battle ... butwe're gonna win this war .
you know how i know?
no .
them .
'cause they're rare .
andattimes iike these , yousee them ... steppingforward .
there's nothing strongerthan the heart of a volunteer, jack .
myfriends in the war department ... don'twant me to lead this raid ... because they say i'm too valuable .
they don'twant me up in the air ... flying with the men that i've chosen ... that i've chewed out , cussed out , pushed to the limit ... and that i've come to respect .
they wantme to stand on the flightdeck ... and wave you off .
well , i don't see itthatway .
so i'm going with you .
we take off tomorrow afternoon ... drop ourfire , and headfor china .
ourmission is to hitmilitary targets ... aircraftandtankfactories .
colonel, you've given us homing beacons ... butyou said china is overrun with japanese troops .
what if the beacons are switched off?
bring her down any way you can ... and do your best to avoid capture .
what if we have to bail out overjapan?
well , in that situation , i can'ttell you whatto do .
whatwould you do , colonel?
i wasn't built to be a prisoner ... so i would have my crew bail out .
i'dfind the sweetest military target i could ... and drive my plane right smack into the middle of it ... and kill as many of those bastards as i could .
butthat's just me .
i'mforty five years old .
i'm an old man .
you guys have yourwhole lives ahead of you ... so whatyou do is upto you .
the mission will launch in a couple of hours .
you'll stay right in here .
here .
stay here .
don'ttalkto them .
they won'ttalkto you .
pretend to type the information we pass you .
that's it .

maybe she's right .
