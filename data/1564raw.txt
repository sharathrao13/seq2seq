we don't want to start another war .
boss , if there is a widow around , don't worry .

they all want us to stay with them .
madame hortense?

who's madame hortense?
a frenchwoman .
she has hotel .
i am mavrandoni .
so you come at last .
i welcome you .
i'm very glad to meet you .
you got my letter?

mr. mavrandoni has been looking after our land .

how many hairs on my head?
she's a widow of the same number of husbands .
bonjour . !
bonjour .
welcome , gentlemen .
this is a great pleasure , madame .
two beds , madame .
without bugs .
monsieur , madame hortense has not the bugs .
you got to admit , boss , it is big , but she shakes it well .
plop , ploof .
this way .
they say it was my grand succs .
you may not believe it , monsieur , but i was a very famous artiste .
oh?
i appear in all the most chic cabarets .
i slept in the silk sheets with real lace .
boss , ask her to dance .
what?
make a pass .
pinch her .
no .
it's only polite .
what?
he would like to dance with you , but , uh , he is shy .
perhaps madame is tired .
she is not .
are you?
come on .
whoa ho !
these cretans !
they are so ungrateful .
don't cry , my little chouchou .
they would be dead ... all dead ... if there was not me .
i know , i know .
no hands .
madame .
hey .
boss , match?
madame?
merci .
pas de quoi .
you know how i came to crete?
with the british fleet .
yes , monsieur .
i was in love with the admiral ... and where he go , i go .
it was here that i met the other three .
what other three?
admirals , of course .
the french , then italian ... and the russian .
oh , how lovely they was , my four admirals ... with their golden epaulet and all those feathers ...
like big , beautiful cockerels .
and what beards ... so soft and curly and perfumed .
fortunately , each has different parfum ... so it was no mistake , even in the dark .
oh , my little chouchou , here , here .
my darling queen , please continue .
yes .
alors ... me and my admirals , we sit on the bed ... dressed very informal .
and we discussion politics ... very serious .
all the time , they pour champagne over me to make me fresh .
it was summer , you know , very hot ... and in this time in crete ... it was big trouble ...
revolution or something .
with my binoculars ...
i could see the poor little cretans ... running in mountains with their flags .
my four admirals ... they want to open the fire ... but i throw myself in the middle .
i pulled an italian by the beard ...
you know , i was more familiar with him ... and i cry , " stop it !
you ...
you can't kill them !
please , canavaro , canavaro mio , no boom boom !
canavaro?
what the hell is that?
what do you think it is?
himself .
canavaro .
canavaro mio .
go on , my chouchou .
again and again , i stopped the boom boom .
and what do you think i get in the end?
what?
what?
tell me .
tell me .
what?
nothing !
no medals .
nothing !
please , no more boom boom .
alors ...
you are laughing .
no .
at me .
no , of course not .
d don't don't go !
that was a very bad thing we did , boss .
the poor , weak creature .
where are you?
bouboulina?
where are you?
my bouboulina .
bouboulina .
ohh .
go away .
it's me , your canavaro .
fine canavaro you are ... no feathers ...
no beard .
oh .
here .
blow , my bouboulina .
who was that ...
bouboulina?
she was a big hero in the war against the turks .
huh , boss?
yes , madame .
she was like you ... a great sea dog .
you see?
yes .
me , too .
i fought breasts to breasts ... but then came the bad times .
they make the peace .
tsk .
aw .
and the ship must go away .
and me , what will become of me?
i cried .
" four times a widow .
oh .
so they laughed , monsieur .
you men are so cruel .
and then they were sorry for me , so they undressed me ... they filled the bath with champagne ... and ... they dropped me .
then they sit all around .
you understand that now that we was all very familiar .
and they drank all the champagne ... all , from the top to the bottom .
then?
and then ... they put out the light .
when i waked up ...
i smelled so good ... all their perfume , one on top of the other .
but they was gone .
men are so cruel .
canavaro .
what is it?
oh !
shh . !
she's here . !
look .
boss , a big , beautiful , wild widow .
pavlo !
look at mavrandoni .
he is burning .
why?
his son is crazy in love with the widow ... but she spits him in the eye .
the more she spits ... the more he wants her .
look .
look at the faces of all these .
they all want her ... and they hate her because they cannot have her .
only one man here ... can .
who?
you .
really?
i saw her eyes when she looked at you .
zorba , don't start .
listen .
god , who is a clever devil ...
today put in your hands a gift from paradise .
don't be silly .
boss , why did god give us hands?
to grab .
well , grab !
boss !
yes?
boss .
listen , you go .
you knock .
you say , " i have come for my umbrella .
she will say , " please , please come in .
no .
boss , boss , don't make me mad .
i don't want any trouble .
boss , life is trouble , only death is not .
to be alive is to undo your belt and look for trouble .
well?
no .
zorba !
what?
for god's sake , boss , will you go back to your papers?
zorba?
get out !
get out !
zorba !
you bastard mountain , i'll eat your guts !
what is it , zorba?
they left their axes inside , that's what .
they are so brave .
every time they hear a noise , they mess their pants .
poo !
zorba , leave them alone !
axes cost money .
i know , and i don't care .
right now i'm just glad that nobody's hurt .
that's all .
and what's more ...
i think you should let them go for today .
boss , you better make up your mind .
are you or are you not a gosh darn capitalist?
i'm hungry .
we got to find some strong trees ... to make beams for the galleries !
damn .
hello .
you're late .
what is it , zorba?
out with it .
boss ...
do you trust me?
yes , i do .
why the hell do you?
because you're you .
but you don't understand .
my brain is not the right weight .
it it gives me such crazy ideas .
i might ruin you .
i'll take that chance .
say that again , boss .
give me courage .
i'll take that chance .
boss .
hmm?
boss !
what?
do you dance?
dance?
uh , no .
no .
oh .
then get out of the way .
i i may knock you down .
opa !
ha !
opa . !
opa . !
opa . !
opa . !
opa . !
dance ]
opa . !
opa . !
zorba !
that's enough !
stop .
stop !
go !
hey .
zorba .
zorba . !
are you all right?
now ...
now i can ...
i can talk again .
what on earth came over you?
when a man is full , what can he do?
burst .
when my little boy dimitri died ... and everybody was crying .
me ...
i got up , and i danced .
they said , " zorba is mad .
but it was the dancing ... only the dancing that ... stopped the pain .
you see , he was my first .
he was only three .
when i'm happy , it's the same thing .
come inside .
you'll catch cold .
with your permission .
now ... will you tell me what this is all about?
i got a plan .
what plan?
a great big crazy plan .
well , what?
i cannot tell you .
why?
trees , monks , machines .
tomorrow , maybe .
tonight , we celebrate !
come on !
don't be delicate !
boss . !
what?
come and see .
remember that plan i could not tell you about?
here it is .
what is it?
it's a mountain .
that one .
oh , yes .
look .
that's the way we'll get the trees down .
an overhead cable?
you're mad .
why?
well , to begin with , that forest doesn't belong to us .
well ... it doesn't and it does .
what does that mean?
it belongs to the monastery ... the monastery belongs to god ... and god belongs to everybody .
you agree?
no , i certainly don't .
all right .
you will pay them something , but not much .
how do you know?
they are friends of mine .
hey , if it works ... we'll bring down the whole forest .
first we get the mine going ... then open a timber factory , we get stinking rich ... then make our own ship and sail around the world .
aren't you going a little too fast?
do you know how old i am?
ah , never mind .
that's a secret .
but i have got to go fast .
you know , they say that age ... kills the fire inside of a man ... that he hears death coming .
he opens the door and says , " come in .
give me rest .
that is a pack of old damn lies .
i've got enough fight in me to devour the world . !
so ...
i fight !
well , do we?
or do we let the mountain win?
tell me what you need .
i will need some strong wire , hooks and things .
i will have to go to town .
i still have to figure out the angle .
if it's not perfect , it will be catastrophe .
how long will it take you?
oh , uh ...
the way things are going , it better be soon or not at all .
i'll give you until christmas .
hey , boss .
rose water .
boss !
well , what news?
i made a great discovery .
stones ... are alive .
oh , that's fine .
i wish , instead , you'd discover your famous ... angle .
i'm trying , boss .
look .
your umbrella .
never mind .
just let me remind you that tomorrow's christmas .
i know .
wh where are you going?
i need some wire .
where the hell did i put it?
won't this string do?
tsk .
excuse me .
look !
a melomakarouno .
a what?
a christmas cookie .
well , what's so strange about that?
nothing .
but many melomakarouno inside an empty trunk is very strange .
an umbrella under a bed is also strange .
all right , all right .
she came here !
no .
she sent them .
now you have the proof .
now it is very simple .
tonight , after bouboulina's party ...
get on with your work !
boss !
you want me to beat you an egg?
it's good for the strength .
boss , now i can tell you a secret .
all these days , i couldn't work , i couldn't sleep .
and you know why?
because of the widow .
don't get me wrong .
i know she's too good for these old bones .
but to think of her without anybody .
that was too much .
all right , laugh .
if a woman sleeps alone , it puts a shame on all men .
if a woman calls a man to her bed ... and he will not go .
i know because a very wise old turk told me .
a turk?
and you , a greek , believed him?
i'm going to wash .
i thought the greeks and the turks never talked .
they just fought .
don't tell me you never went to war .
i don't like that kind of stupid talk .
what's so stupid about fighting for your country?
excuse me , boss .
you talk like a teacher .
you think like a teacher .
how can you understand?
of course i can .
with your head , yes .
you say , " this is right .
this is wrong .
but when you talk ...
i watch your arms , your legs , your chest .
they are dumb .
they say nothing .
so how can you understand?
you're just making up excuses .
i don't believe you give a damn about your country .
don't you talk to me like that !
look here , here , here !
nothing on the back .
i have done things for my country ... that would make your hair stand .
i have killed , burned villages , raped women .
and why?
because they were turks or bulgarians !
that's the rotten damn fool i was .
now i look at a man , any man ... and i say he is good , he is bad .
what do i care if he's greek or turk?
as i get older , i swear by the bread i eat ...
i even stop asking that .
good or bad?
what is the difference?
food for worms .
and as for women ... you make fun of me that i love them .
how can i not love them?
they are such poor , weak creatures ... and it takes so little .
a man's hand on their breast , and they give you all they got .
where are you , bouboulina?
canavaro is here . !
buon giorno , buona sera , mangaite macaroni .
chouchou .
look what i brought you .
merci .
happy christmas .
i made it myself to make her feel good .
oh !
it's me?
yes .
merry christmas , madame .
and also for you .
what is that extraordinary smell coming from the kitchen?
it is a big , fat turkish .
a turkish?
oh , mon dieu . !
i hope he's not burning .
do not worry .
sit down .
we will start from the center , the belly .
then we will take care of the other parts later .
yes .
merci .
aren't you feeling well?
in my age , monsieur , one is never well .
especially on the holidays .
i drink to your health ... my beautiful chouchou mermaid .
may you grow new teeth ... and new skin ... and throw away these stupid ribbons you wear to hide your neck .
may the great powers come back to crete .
and when you rise out of the waves to greet them ... may all their damn ships crash ... on these round , hard rocks !
i wish it could happen , what you say , but it is too late .
ah , no , no .
no , it is not .
oh !
meow !
no !
no !
are you all right?
you see , it is ... too late .
up , up , up .
oh , don't be sad , my little bouboulina .
i have heard of a new doctor in europe .
he makes ... miracles .
you take what the hell ever he gives you ... drops or powders ... and you become 20 again , maybe 25 .
i will get you some .
you will?
sure .
a big bottle?
a whole barrel .
what are you thinking?
alexandria , beirut , istanbul ... how they loved me .
who?
everybody .
belebe , mustafa and aspacher ...
suleyman , pasha .
especially suleyman .
those damn cats .
well , i ...
shh .
what?
she's asleep?
yes .
oh , let her .
she's 20 again .
she's strolling around alexandria , beirut .
look at her ... smiling .
silly old bitch .
come on .
we can't go and just leave her alone like that .
she's not alone !
she's with suleyman , pasha ...
having hell of a time .
dirty old cow .
she's in .
go .
and god bless you .
hey , where are you going?
to church .
what ...
i've never been to a greek christmas .
oh , boss ...
no !
don't you understand?
understand what?
i understand you are young and full of energy ...
and i don't understand what the hell you're doing with it !
i've had enough of this .
why don't you leave me alone?
because i love you and i want the best for you .
don't shout !
who's shouting?
there she is .
she is waiting .
cigarette?
this is ridiculous .
i'm not going to stand here arguing .
but , boss , she ... she is waiting for you !
let's just say that i'm different ... and i've got to go my own way .
if god went your way , there would be no christmas .
he did not go to church .
he went to mary .
and christ was born .
he went that way .
mary is the widow .
cigaro .
on a deaf man's door , you can knock forever !
now here's the money .
thank you .
and remember , it's all i can afford .
well , boss , i know .
just buy what we need for the cable and come straight back .
of course .
and don't get stuck anywhere on the way .
i will be quick like the wind .
five days .
you you promised .
boss , i promise .
good bye , boss .
zorba !
zorba !
zorba !
what do you want?
don't forget me .

goochie goochie !
goochie goochie goochie !
that's it .
i shall not describe you ...
the continuation ...
except to say ...
that it was long ... and very wild .
very , very wild .
uh ...
next afternoon ...
next afternoon ...
i wake up .
and ... what do i see ... next to me ... in bed?
the female sex ... in person .
soft ... and warm ... and sweet smelling .
so i say to myself ...
zorba ...

enjoy it .
don't move .
imagine what luck ...
there's a restaurant opposite .
and they send us food , splendiferous food ... caviar ... steaks , baklava , everything .
we eat , and back to work , and back to sleep ... and so on , et cetera .
antoni !
so this is my good news , darling boss .
and don't you worry .
i think of your business also .
but i ask you , why push things?
every day my head becomes more clear ... and i shall be able to make the best deals .
i kiss you friendly .

p. s. , i forgot to tell you .
her name is lola .

a gift for you .
a box of ...
english chocolates .
thank you .
it's all right .
hey , no more fooling around .

you are incorrigible .
i don't know what that means , but here ... with my compliments .
good god !
what have you done to your hair?
i painted it .
why?
for pride .
so i could go out with lola without making her ashamed .
ah , he laughs .
but listen .
you know what?
i became young like my hair .
stronger than a bull .
you ask lola .
and you know that , uh , pain in my kidneys?
that's gone .

by the way , boss , i come in last night and you are out .
where the hell are you?
oh !
zorba !
zorba !

why do the young die?
why does anybody die?
tell me .
i don't know .
what's the use of all your damn books?
if they don't tell you that , what the hell do they tell you?
they tell me ... about the agony of men ... who can't answer questions like yours .
i spit on their agony .
who's that?
it's me .
my god !
get her inside quickly .
hey .
did you get drenched?
you are cruel !
why you abandon me?
i will make some coffee .
the whole village , they are laughing at me .
