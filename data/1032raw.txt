it's never been done before .
it's gonna need planing
a large crew
guns?
exactly
a lot of security .
but the take ..
what's the target? .. 8 figures each .
what's the target?
when was the last time youre in vegas?
you want to knock over a casino .
the vault at the bellagio .
well , if im reading this right
and i like to think that i am ,
this is propably the least accessible vault ever designed .
yep .
you said three casinos .
these featuring the cages of the mirage
mgm grand , but every diamond is up there .
bellagio , the mirage .
these are terry benedict's places .
yes , they are .
eating your mind?
somewhat .
you'd need at least dozen of guys doing combination of cons .
what would you think?
at the top of my head , i'd say your looking at ...
lebowsky , jim brown , miss daisy ... two jethros ... and leon spinks .
not to mention the biggest ella fitzgerald , ever .
do you think you can get the money to back this?
if we hitting these three casinos , we get our bank role .
benedict's gotta long list of enemys .
yeah , but enemy with loose cash , and nothing to lose .
ruben .
ruben .
hey !
oscar , lower a bit will you?
sorry .
you guys done up here?
just wanna take this home and make some copy's , if thats alright .
what ever you need .
appreciate it .
what?
i need a reason .
don't say money .
why do this?
why not do it?
because yesterday i walked out that joint after losing four years of my life ,
and your cold deckin teen beek cover boys .
because the house always wins .
play long enough you never change the stakes .
the house takes you
unless , when that perfect hand comes a long , and you bet big ,
and then you take the house .
you've been practising this speech , havent you?
little bit , did i rush it?
no .
it's good , i liked it .
i wonder what ruben will say .
you out of your god damn minds
are you listening to me?
you both of you nuts .
i know more about casino security than anyman alive .
i invented it .
and it cannot be beaten .
they got cameras , got watchers , they got locks ,
they got timers , they got vaults .
they got enough armed personel to occupy paris .
okay .
bad example .
it's never been tried .
never been tried .
it's been tried .
a few guys even came close .
you know the three most successful robberies in the history of vegas?
number three , the bronze metal , hanson grabs a lock box at the horse shoe .
he got two step closer to the door than any living soul before him .
second most sucessful robbery .
the flamingo in 71 .
this guy actually taste the fresh oxygen before they grab him .
ofcourse , he was breathing out of a hose for the next three weeks
god damn hippy .
and the closest , anyman has ever come to robbing a las vegas casino .
was out side the caesar's in 87 .
he came .
he grabbed .
they conquered .
but what i'm saying , you guys are pro's .
the best .
i'm sure you can make it out of the casino .
of course , last we forget
once you go out of the front door , you still in the middle of the fucking desert .
your right .
he is right .
ruben , you're right .
our eyes are bigger than our stomachs .
that's exactly what it is , pure ego .
thank you for lunch .
look , we all go way back and the ..
i owe you from the thing with the guy and the place ..
i'll never forget it .
that's my pleasure .
give dominic your addresses , i got some remained furniture i wanna send you .
look , just out of curiosity .
which casino's did you geniuses picked to rob?
it's bellagio , the mirage and the mgm grand .
those are terry benedict's casino's .
is that right?
that's right .
you guys ..
what do you got against terry benedict?
what do you have against him , thats the question .
he torpedoed my casino , muscled me out .
now he's gonna blow it up next month to make way some gorge monstrosity ..
don't think i don't see what your doing .
what are we doing , ruben?
you gonna steal from terry benedict you better god damn know ..
it used to be civilized , he'd hit the guy , he whacked you , done , but with benedict ...
the end of this ...
better not know youre involved
not know your names , or think your dead , because he'll kill you .
and then he gonna work on you .
that's why we have to be very careful .
very precise well funded .
you gonna be nuts too .
and you gonna need a crew as nuts as you are .

america's playground .

saul , do you make it up to utah much?
not as often i'd like .
think you should check it out .
think you could do very well there .
gentlemen , welcome to las vegas .
everybody's eaten?
good .
everybody's sober?
close enough .
alright , before we get started , nobody's on the line here yet .
what i'm about to propose to you is both highly lucrative and highly dangerous .
if that doesn't seem to be your particular brand of vodka
help yourself have food as much you like and have a safe journey , no hard feelings .
otherwise come with me .
you're bobby caldwell's kid , huh?
from chicago?
yeah .
it's nice there , do you like it?
yeah .
that's wonderful , get into the god damn house .
gentlemen , the three thousand blocks of las vegas boulevard .
otherwise known as the bellagio , the mirage and the mgm grand .
together they are the three most profitable casinos in las vegas , let me see .
this is the vault at the bellagio .
it's located below the strip .
beneath 200 feet of solid earth , it safe guards every dime that passes thru each of the three casinos above it .
were gonna rob it .
smash and grab job , huh?
slightly more complicated than that .
yeah ..
this is courtesy of frank catton , new blackjack dealer at the bellagio .
ok , bad news first .
this place houses a security system that rivals most nuclear missile silos .
first , we have to get within the casino cages .
which anybody , i'll tell you , takes more than a smile .
next , thru these doors .
each of which requires a different sex digit code , changed every twelve hours .
pass those , lies the elevator , this is where it gets tricky .
the evelator wont move without authorized finger print identification .
which we cant fake .
and vocal confirmation from both the security system within the bellagio and the vault below .
which we won't get .
further more , the elevator shaft is rigged with motion detectors .
meaning , if we'd manually override the lift , the shafts exit would lock down automaticly , and we'd be trapped .
now , once we get down the shaft though , then it's a peace of cake .
just , two more guards , with uzi's ,
and the most elaborate vault door ever conceived by man .
any questions?
why don't we go underground?
no tunneling is out , there are sensors monitoring the ground a hundred yards in every direction .
if a groundhog would nest there , they know about it .
anyone else?
you said something about good news?
yeah .
the nevada gaming commission stipulates that a casino must hold an reserve , enough cash to cover every chip on the planets floor .
that means on a weekday by law .
it has to carry anywhere between $60 and $70 million in cash and coin .
on the weekend ,
between 8 0 and 9 0 million .
on a fight night , like the one two week's from the night tonight , we gonna rob it
hundred and fifty million , without breaking a sweat .
now , there are eleven of us , each with an equal share , you do the math ..
exactly .
i have a question .
say we get into the cage , and through the security door there , and down the evaluator , we can't move . and pass the guards with the guns . and into the vault we can't open .
without being seen by cameras .
o'yeah , sorry i forgot to mention that .
well , say we do all that , would you suppose to walk out of there with $150 million in cash on us , and without getting stopped?
yeah .
ok .
alright , here's how we begin .
first task , reconnaissance .
we wanna know everything thats going on , on all three casinos .
from the rotation of the dealers ,
to the path of every cash coin .
wanna know every thing about every guard , every watcher ,
anyone with the security pass .
i wanna know where they from ,
what their nicknames are , how they take their coffee .
most of all , i want you guys to know these casino's .
built as labyrints , to keep people in ,
i want you guys to know the quick routes out .
10 : 46 , gotta watch the horse .
second task , power .
on the night of the fight , we gonna throw the switch on sin city .
bash , it's your show .
you want broke , blind and bedlam .
how about all three .
right , it's done .
third task , surveillance .
casino security has an eye in the air on everything .
so , we need an eye in the air on them .
livingston?
well , it's not the least accessible system i've seen , but it's close ,
then it's definitely a black bag job .
how many technicians?
two .
and one of 'em is lonely .
thanks , honey .
i'll have it back in an hour .
send hi to your mom , for me .
say it yourself .
she's off in five minutes .
watch it , bud .
who you calling bud , pal?
who you calling pal , friend?
who youre calling friend?
jackass !
don't call me jackass .
i just did call you jackass .
33 , we have a visual reduce at the north 0352 exit door camera .
copy that , i see them .
sir , please remove your baloons .
you got in my way .
gentlemen ..
balloon boy .
balloon boy ya balloon boy .
damn , were up and running .
why are they always painting hallways in that colour?
they say it's very soothing .
i'm gonna need to tell you to remove these balloons , now !
hey , hold up a minute .
excuse me .
hey .
excuse me .
hey , you drop this .
ah , thank you .
how's the reception on these things?
excellent .
take care .
well .
ya .
fourth task , construction .
we need to build an exact working replica of the bellagio vault .
for practise?
something like that .
fifth task , intelligence .
we need those codes linus , from the only guy who has all three .
benedict?
learn to love your shadow .
wait , wait , wait ,
all i get is to watch the guy?
you gotta walk before you can crawl .
sixth task , transport .
i am sorry , but 18, 5 a piece , is the best offer that i can make .
well , i understand .
they are some great looking vans , you got there .
yes , sir , top of the line .
okay , thank you for your time , mr ..
denim , billy tim denim .
yes .
denim like'em jeans?
yes !
just like the jeans .
man , you got some lovely hands .
do you moisturize?
i am sorry?
i've had tried all sorts of brands and lotions , i even wore a fragrant free for whole year .
now , my sister , she uses a ... .. alovera .
with a little sunscreen in it .
and i dearly speak , you 'all should wear gloves before you go to bed .
i've found out there might be little interference with my social agenda , you know what i mean?
so im really not getting into the traditional remidies , you know .
i see , let me tell you something .
if you're willing to pay cash ,
i might be able to drop that down to say seventeen , sexteen , each?
no .
you do that?
well , yes sir .
that will be lovely , they told me come see you .
i'm sure glad they did .
okay , well .
let me go get the paper work ..
and , and , and ..
i'll be right back .
you just wait here .
you do that .
thank you , sir .
it's a very nice material .
it's imported silk , saul .
very nice .
gentlemen , would you excuse us for second?
saul , are you sure you really ready to do this?
if you ever ask me that question again , daniel ,
you will not wake up the following morning .
he's ready .
my name is lyman .
my name is lyman zerga .
my name is lyman zerga .
okay , tell me about benedict .
that guy is a machine .
good afternoon , mr benedict .
he arrives at the bellagio every day at 2 : 00pm .
same car , same driver .
remembers every vale's name on the way in .
not bad for a guy worth 3/ 4 of a billion .
offices are upstairs , he works hard , hits the lobby floor at seven on the note .
good evening , sir .
spends three minutes on the floor with his casino manager .
what do they talk about?
all business .
benedict likes to know whats going on in his casino .
likes to been in control .
theres rarely an incident , he doesn't know about or handle personally .
spends a few minutes gladhanding the high rolers .
he's fluid in spanish , german , italian and he's taking japanese lessons and getting pretty good at it .
he's up by 7 : 30 when an assistant hands him a black portfolio .
contents , todays take and new security codes .
then , he heads to the restaurant .
like i said , a machine .
that portfolio contains the codes , to all the cage doors?
in two minutes after they changed he got'em in his hands .
tell you , you really can't pick him .
this guy's so smart as he is ruthless .
last guy they caught cheating in here ,
he not only sent him up for ten years ,
but he had the bank cease his house ,
then he bankrupted his brother in law tracktor dealership .
he doesnt just take out your niece , the guy goes after your livelihood , and the livelihood of anybody you ever met .
you scared?
you suicidal?
only in the morning .
now what?
now comes the girl .
where she come from?
museum up there .
she a curator .
here she is .
this is the best part of my day .
still dont know if we can use her yet .
actually , i havent even caught her name .
tess .
her name is tess .
we have to talk .
ok .
now .
tell me this is not about her .
or , i'm walking off this job right now .
who?
tess .
terry benedict .
tell me it is not about screwing the guy who's screwing your wife .
ex wife .
tell me .
it's not about that .
it's not entirely about that .
remember when we first got into this business .
we said , we're gonna play the game like we'd have nothing to lose .
i lost something .
i lost someone , thats why i'm here .
here's the problem .
now were stealing 2 things .
if you can't have both , which you gonna choose?
and remember ...
tess does not split in 11 ways .
if everything goes the plan ,
then i wont be the one , who have to make that choice .
how she looked?
she look good .
thanks .
you like it?
i like that you like it .
i'll see you tonight .
in my hotell there is always somebody watching .
i'll see you tonight .
you feel weak , mr. zerga?
i don't believe in weakness , it cost too much .
i don't believe in questions either .
oh , really?
well let me give you a tip .
i wouldn't get in to terry benedict ,
for too much money .
he doesn't fool around .
anything for me?
mr. zerga , lyman zerga .
third position .
he wants to speak to you privately .
who is he?
businessman of somekind from europe .
very vague .
acts around , word is he's does primary in arms .
one of the biggest .
zerga ..

hello , tess .
what are you doing here?
i'm out .

of prison .
you remeber the day i went for cigarrette's and didn't came back?
you must've noticed .
i don't smoke , don't sit .
now they tell me that i've payed my debt to society .
funny , i never got a cheque .
you are not wearing your ring .
i sold it .
i don't have a husband and you didn't get the papers .
i told you i'd write .
danny ...
go now , before ...
what?
benedict?
how are you doing?
whiskey , in a whiskey .
danny .
tess , you're doing a great job , curative the museum ,
the vermeire , is quite good .
simple , vibrant , although the work definetly fell of as you got older .
do i remind you of anyone?
i always confused monet and manet ,
now , which one married his mistress?
monet .
right , and then manet had syfilis .
they also painted occasionally .
i will make this quick .
i came here for you .
want to get on with my life , and want you with me .
you are a thief , and a liar .
i only lied about being a thief .
i don't do that anymore .
steal?
lie .
i'm with someone now that doesn't have to make that kind of distinction .
he is very clear on both .
you know what your problem is?
i only have one .
you have met too many people like you .
i'm with terry now .
does he make you laugh?
he doesn't make me cry .
mr. benedict , the fight is on saturday night , is it not?
yes , would you like some tickets?
no , no , hand to hand combat does not interest me .
i have a package arriving here that evening .
black briefcase , standard size .
the contents of which is very valueble to me .
i'll put in the house safe for you .
the house safe is for brandy and grandmothers pearls .
i need something more secure .
mr. zerga , i can assure you that our house safe is ...
i can assure you , mr. benedict ,
that your generosity in this manner will not go overlooked .
now , what can you offer me besides the safe?
see the people you steal things from?
they have insurance to compensate them , they get made whole again .
i had to leave new york to get away from what happened .
how am i gonna get my 5 years back , danny?
you can't .
but what you can do is not throw away another 5 .
alright , you don't love me anymore ,
you want to make life with someone else , fine .
i will have to live with that .
but not him .
spoken like a true ex husband .
i'm not joking , tess .
i'm not laughing , danny .
you have to admit , there is a bit conflict of interest ,
when you give me advice about my love life .
yes .
but that doesn't mean that i'm wrong .
do you remember what i said to you when we first met?
you said i'd better know what i'm doing .
do you?
because truly , you should walk out the door if you don't .
i know what am i doing .
what are you doing?
just catching up .
terry , meet my ex husband .
daniel ocean .
i'm in your seat .
forgive me for being late .
i guest caught my attention .
thats fine .
danny was walking thru the restaurant and spotted me .
is that right?
yes , imagine the odds .
of all the restaurants in the world .
you recently where released from prison , is that correct?
thats right .
how does it feel to be out?
about the same .
danny was just about ...
i just stop by to say hi to tess for old time sake .
stay and have a drink .
he can't .
i can't .
i don't imagine you will be seeing mr. ocean anytime soon , right?
you never know .
i know everything happening in my hotels .
so i should put those towels back?
no , the towels you can keep .
good to see you tess .
take care danny .
terry .
danny .
do whatever you like .
call us at 17 . 30 .
make up in costumes .
saul's package arrives at 19 . 05 .
linus grabs their codes .
if all goes well , were go .
19 . 30 , yen gets locked in , were commited .
from this point we have 30 minutes to blow the power ,
once the electricity goes ,
all access points to the vault , and it's elevator , will automaticly shut down for 2 minutes .
thats when we make our move .
ok .
lets put you in the middle of the room .
10 feet from everything .
we have to get from there , to the door , and without touching the floor .
what do you do?
10 is too short .
twenty .
yeah , were in deep shit ..
the proxy democrats uses a coax auxilliry , to back the main line , have they?
they only rise the level on the mainframe couplet .
right up .
do you understand any of this?
i'll explain later .
listen ..
they blown the backup grid one by one , like dominoes .
bash , what happened?
they did the same thing i've would done ,
only they did it by accident .
problem is , they know about the weakness and are sorting it out .
they're fixin 'it .
so unless we intended to do this job and re know .. .. were in barney .
.. trouble !
we could always ...
by tomorrow .
hang on a minute , hang on .
we could use the pinch .
whats a pinch?
a pinch is a device which creates a cardiac arrest for any broadband electrical circuitry .
but better yet , a pinch is a bomb .
but without the 'bomb '.
when a nuclear bomb detonates , it unleashes an electro magnetic pulse , which shutdowns any powersource within its blast radius .
it tend not matter in most cases , because the nuclear weapon usually destroys everything you might need power for anyway .
but a pinch creates a similar electro magnetic pulse , but without the fuzz of mass destruction and death .
how long?
about 30 seconds .
can a pinch knock out the power of an entire city?
like for instance .. .. lasvegas?
i think it might .
but there is only one pinch in the world big enough that would manage it .
well .
lets go , come on .
where you going?
come with you?
no .
no , no , no .
don't leave me with these guys !
i start .

hello .
may i have a word with mr. benedict?
it's for you .
who the hell is this?
the man who's robbing you .
what the hell is going on in the vault?
nothing sir .
it's all normal .
show me ...
i'm afraid you've mistaken .
you watching your monitors?
ok , keep watching .
this time your luck changed quite quickly .
find out how much money we have down there .
yes , sir .
tess .
perhaps you should ...
perhaps i should what??
it would be better if you were not around here for this ..
alright .
you proved your point ,
you broke into my vault ,
congratulations ,
you're a dead man .
maybe .
maybe?
may i ask how you expect to leave?
do you believe i'm gonna allow you to carry bags full of my money thru the casino doors?
no , you're gonna carry it out for us .
now why would i do that?
take a closer look at your monitor .
as your manager's properly reporting to you now
you have little over $160mn in your vault tonight .
you may noticed
we're only packing up about half of that .
the other half , we're leaving in your vault , booby trapped as a hostage .
you let our $80 million go , and you get to keep yours .
thats the deal .
if you'd trying to stop us , we blow both cascets .
mr. benedict?
you could lose $80mn tonight secretly or you could lose $160mn publicly .
it's your decision .
hi .
make the call .
911 emergency response .
where's danny?
danny's fine .
he's in a good form .
he requested you'd go upstairs and watch tv .
he does?
we have 3 men with explosives who have taking control in our vault .
ok .
it's alright , tess .
you have a deal .
i promise .
fantastic , here's what you do .
the guys in the vault will deposit six bags into the vault elevator .
the elevator will rise to your cages .
three of your guards will pickup the bags and carry them out into the casino .
now , if they take more than 20 seconds to reach the casino floor
or there's any indication a switch has been made , we blow the money in the bags and the money in the vault .
he's in the casino by the slots .
ofcourse i'm in the casino .
in fact , i'm staying in your hotel .
i have two word's for you , mini bar .
as soon as your guards hit the casino floor
a white unmarked van is going to pull up in your valet station .
your guards will load the bags into the van's rear .
if anyone so much as approches the drivers door
we blow everything .
when i get the word , the van is away and the money is secured
my men will exit the building .
once their safety is confirmed
you will get your vault back .
swat team is here .
alright .
now
i have complied with your every request .
would you agree?
i would .
good .
cause now i have one of my own .
run and hide , asshole .
run and hide .
if you should be picked up next week by an $100 000 postal
i'm gonna be supremely dissapointed
because i want my people to find you
and when they do , rest assure
were not gonna hand you over to the police .
so , my advice to you again is this
run and hide .
that is all that i ask .
mr. benedict
our guy say that van is heading toward the mc carran airport .
get everyone in position , i want my vault back before the van hits the tarmack .
nightgoggles on .

for hookers .
walsh .
que up the tape of the robbery .
yes sir , i'm looking at the tape now .
