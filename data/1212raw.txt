you're lucky , you know .
i rarely allow anyone into my flat .
i know , i know , i know .
humble digs .
not exactly what you'd call a " panty peeler .
do you know what i mean?
but it suits me just fine .
to be honest , i rarely spend a night in my own bed anyway .
for most women , if a guy's a good provider and generally a nice chap , six pack abs really aren't a deal breaker .
on the flip side , however , even though the pc boyfriend sat next to you with his arm slung around your shoulder will deny it ...
and he will deny it .
for us boys , it's all about f. b. b.
face .
boobs .
bum .
i'm just being honest .
it's been said that clothes speak the international language .
and i have to admit , i'm a bit of a fashion whore .
unfortunately , today i've got work , and i have to tone it down a little bit , but that's all right .
gucci .
end of summer sale .
very understated .
and i can easily spice it up with ...
what?
no , no .
i know what you are thinking .
if you ooze masculinity , like some of us do , you have no reason to fear pink .
smashing .
now , in the cologne department , most men overdo it .
americans practically spray it on with a crop duster .
nothing above the neck , though i do like a little splash on big ben .
you never know where the day may take you .
almost forgot .
new word for the day .
the attempt to attract attention to oneself .
who?
me?
oh , blimey .
i'm so rude .
i haven't introduced myself .
i'm ...
alfie?
there you go .
alfie .
are you the little elf that left these mocha bonbons on my doorstep?
no , no , no .
you must have a secret admirer , mrs schnitman .
you are such a doll , alfie .
but i'm supposed to be on a diet .
oh , on a diet?
a diet .
you?
yeah .
now , i don't mean to be forward , lu , but you should know by now that a full figured girl like yourself
is every guy's secret fantasy .
stop it .
so she's a tub of lard .
the ship's already sailed , so why not make her feel good about herself , right?
oh , lu?
yes , angel?
i'm working the night spot , and my apartment is a horror show , so i'm sorry if i keep you up
with the dust busting at 2 a . m .
oh , don't you worry .
i'll give it a quick straighten .
oh , no , no , you don't need to that .
nonsense .
i like doing things for you , alfie .
i'm a blessed man having you in my life .
thank you .
keys are in the usual spot .
now , back home , you're always hearing tales about some bloke migrating to the states and winding up with buckets of money .
so not long ago , i packed up my bucket and headed west .
now , i must admit , i had a second motive .
i'd always been told that the most beautiful women in the world ... ... resided in manhattan .
location , location , location .
god , i love this city .
all right , girls .
just look around .
i mean , every one of them , unique , special ,
like snowflakes .
and with such a plethora ...
calendar word meaning " abundance , " of gorgeousness and diversity , well , how could a man ever choose to settle down with just one?
i myself subscribe more to the european philosophy of life .
my priorities leaning towards wine , women ...
well , actually , that's about it .
wine and women .
although , women and women is always a fun option .
so ... ... to live life to the fullest ,
i require only enough to cover my modest expenses .
i've no desire to be the richest stiff in the cemetery .
i think this might just be my favourite position .
i know it was president kennedy's .
he was such a great leader .
of course , jfk used the old bad back excuse , but if you ask me , he knew it gave you maximum pleasure with minimum exertion .
what is it about the back of a limo?
obligatory cuddling .
thousand one , thousand two ...
cripes .
hey , i've gotta get cracking .
i've got a 10 : 00 pickup .
you better hurry up .
you don't want to keep her waiting .
quite the number , isn't she?
yet , she tells me her old man hasn't shagged her in six months .
six months .
i mean , thank god there are gentlemen like me around to pick up the slack .
just look at her .
legs like a racehorse .
perfect yoga bum .
a minus .
where did we tell the old man we were going tonight?
a movie .
treasure , please , no , no , no .
stop messing about .
you'll ruin my presets .
sorry .
what movie?
i don't know .
what's the difference?
the difference is , the more detail you give , the less interested he'll be .
it wouldn't matter what i said .
it would never occur to phil that another man
would ever look twice at me .
dor , darling , you fishing for a compliment?
no .
you should know by now they only come from me when least expected .
now , come and have a mint so phil doesn't smell the alfie on your breath .
i don't care if he does .
it's married women .
dorie doesn't know it yet , but you won't be seeing much more of her .
i've got that all too familiar feeling .
sooner or later , she'll be wanting a little bit more than i'm able to give .
wouldn't it be great if i was going home with you tonight instead of phil the pill?
yeah .
it's definitely time to stage a disappearing act .
so next tuesday , same time , same place?
i'm sorry , love , it's fashion week .
i'm booked double shifts .
i'll call you the instant things let up .
okay .
in the meantime , i left you a little souvenir to remember me by .
oh , dor?
your derrire looks really rather ravishing from this vantage point .
see?
a compliment when least expected .
what can i say?
happy as a pup with two tails .
and i think i've done old phil a bit of a favour too .
of course , he'd be the last to see it .
never expect any thanks in this life .
you know what i mean?
so tuesday ... ... 10 : 03 p . m .
do i drag myself home to a cold flat , empty fridge , or nip across town for a hot bath , warm body , breakfast in bed?
decisions , decisions ...
yeah , i think i'll pay a visit to my semi regular , quasi , sort of girlfriend .
my sweet julie .
let me guess .
unexpected last minute fare .
yeah .
she had me going up and down for hours .
that supposed to be funny?
because it is so very ...
not .
hey !
i'm not kidding , alfie !
i'm not kidding .
i hate you sometimes .
you have a very ostentatious way of showing it .
yeah , i sure do .
no , darling .
can we hit pause?
i just need a second to unwind .
oh , i nicked half a bottle of stoli from the limo .
how do you want yours , on the rocks?
i just want my usual , alfie .
straight up .
no , i'm so totally knackered .
i'll make it up to you in the morning .
cross my heart .
but tonight , all i'm good for is a bite to eat , hot bath and a nice long sleep .
you know , this isn't a holiday inn , alfie .
what's that again?
where were you tonight?
really?
you've got to open a restaurant .
that's seriously delicious .
thanks , alfie .
it's just chilli .
hey .
a little eye contact , please .
we have something here , or am i just a glorified booty call?
hey .
hey .
she wants me to commit .
become " domestified .
now , it doesn't do to become dependent on anybody in this life .
change your nature , you're a dead man .
chilli , please .
don't get me wrong .
she's adorable .
cute?
absolutely .
but is it ever enough?
i told you how we men are .
we want showstoppers .
and the problem is , julie hasn't got enough of the superficial things that really matter .
i don't deserve you .
yeah , that's probably true .
too bad i love you .
thanks , babe .
alfie , alfie ...
what?
you're giving me the " thanks , babe .
you're giving me the " thanks , baby .
calm down .
don't tell me to calm down !
i know how you feel !
wait a minute .
you're gonna wake up ...
max .
hey , little man .
did we wake you up?
yes .
now , lads , learn from my mistake .
never get involved with a single mum .
see , they come with accessories , some of which can be ... ... unfortunately , irresistible .
sights like that make you realize we all have an expiration date .
and women do have a shorter shelf life than men , don't they?
i think that's what julie was banging on about yesterday .
elegant limousine and chauffeur .
this is where i make my reasonably honest living .
standards of elegance has taken quite a pounding , wouldn't you say?
i know .
believe me , it's merely a stepping stone .
currently parked on one of those stepping stones is my best mate and future business partner , marlon .
black .
like lonette's skin ... ... which i will never again touch .
i'm afraid you're not meeting my man on top form .
see , marlon's got a problem .
it's called lonette .
and very recently , it dumped him .
oh , dear .
come on , what was it this time?
three a . m .
begging , at her front door .
level of inebriation?
vomiting .
right .
so let me get this straight .
you were at her front door , 3 a . m .
in the morning , begging and vomiting?
and what , she wasn't charmed by that?
alfie?
why is there no stoli in car number two?
i've no idea .
i gotta watch this guy like a hawk .
that little chap's name is wing .
my boss and owner of this tragic enterprise .
wipe that car good .
owner , that is , till me and marlon swing a loan and buy it out from underneath his scrawny ...
hello .
you miss bird shit .
wing .
he's barking mad .
check out the way he talks to the little woman .
she's given him her best years , cooked his chop suey , helped with the business , and i bet at one time he couldn't wait to rip off her kimono .
and now look at him .
and i'm supposed to respect the institution of marriage?
that's a great figure , man .
we swing that loan , cash your ira , i hock my vespa ...
we're gonna take wing by surprise with an offer like this .
i could've predicted this .
see , marlon and lonette have reached that critical 18 month " where are we going , what are we doing , what's happening here? " crisis point that rears its ugly head in every relationship .
lonette wanted ring , home , baby .
marlon wanted another 18 months to make sure nothing better was coming his way .
i fucked up egregiously .
i see you're making the most of that birthday calendar .
by the time he realized he'd made a mistake and he wanted her back ... ... it was too late .
hey , stranger .
hey .
carol .
carol .
hi , carol .
hi .
you look wonderful .
so , carol , well , it's nice to see you again .
you be well .
what's up with that?
put it this way , the show closed after one performance only .
do i even wanna know why?
no .
come on , it would be less than discreet to tell you why .
hair on the arms .
seriously .
long , thick ...
what are you talking about?
you don't have hair on your arms?
you're looking very lovely tonight .
thank you .
dude , the iron door has slammed shut , man .
classic , isn't it?
now that he can't have her , he thinks he can't live without her .
some people are funny .
marlon's predicament got me thinking about my own situation .
maybe ...
maybe it was time to stoke the home fires .
anybody in the mood for a little alfie , straight up?
oh , this isn't a good time , alfie .
got a lot on my mind .
oh , god .
yeah , i really hate when that happens .
open up , baby .
you look seriously beautiful .
not tonight , alfred .
what's the matter?
tell me .
i don't ...
i'm just ...
well , i guess i'm ...
i'm just ...
i'm just seeing red .
i mean , the poor guy , he's dying .
come on , haven't you ...?
you've tortured him long enough .
alfie , he should've thought about all that before he was screwing around with that ex girlfriend of his .
those fake ass , $5 titties .
those are fake?
hello?
wow , i'm devastated .
they've got , like ...
alfie , you're supposed to be consoling my devastation , remember?
i am .
look , he came back , didn't he?
begging , crawling on his knees , vomiting ...
i don't care .
i'm sorry , i'm not that easy .
i don't forgive and i definitely do not forget .
is okay if i leave now , miss?
oh , s , felix .
and hit the lights on your way out , por favor .
i better go .
it's really coming down out there .
yeah .
and i'm wearing suede .
you're telling the truth .
that's brilliant .
okay .
i got one .
i never swam in the pacific ocean .
me neither .
oh , shit .
okay .
okay .
i've never seen a james bond movie .
you're joking .
not even a sean connery?
you serious?
wow , i don't know if that's magic or tragic .
okay .
five ball .
my go .
i've never made my own bed .
oh , bullshit .
no , i repeat , i've never made my own bed .
well , what kind of mama you got?
that's a good question .
let's see .
all right .
i got something for you .
all right .
i've never had sex ...
i've never had sex with two people in one night .
six five , your favour .
gotcha .
so , alfie , what's the most you've had in one night?
we've stopped playing the game , haven't we?
am i wrong , or is there a little innocent flirting going on here?
driftin 'on a memory
ain't no place i'd rather be than with you
loving you
see , if i had that kind of talent ...
and a song
go on , finish your sentence .
if i had that kind of talent , and i looked like you ...
and a song ... i would be strutting my stuff oh , yeah?
on a stage .
trust me , what happens next was the furthest thing from my mind when i dropped by tonight .
but then i thought to myself ,
you know what?
if this will help her get past her anger towards marlon ,
i owe it to both of them , as a friend , right?
to do whatever i can to help .
i find that , lately , even lying to myself comes easily .
the next morning , and i can't get last night out of my mind .
try desperately to focus on something else , anything else .
anything to get my mind off my best friend's incredibly hot , best ass i've ever seen in my life girlfriend .
alfie .
alfie .
alfie !
shall i pretend i can't hear him?
dude .
hey !
too late .
too late .
dude , would you slow down?
hey , marly , what's up?
marly "?
hey , listen , i gotta talk to you .
you ain't going nowhere till you tell me what went down last night .
down last night?
dude , don't mess with me .
what happened with lonette?
have you ever heard the word " knock "?
what went down?
what?
nothing happened .
we had a few shots .
missus give me silent treatment .
little she know , not hearing constant " blah , blah , blah " is gift from heaven .
you keep it up .
keep it up , mate , it'll work .
alfie , what happened?
oh , fuck a duck , man .
look , i ...
i drank a lot last night .
drunk .
well , i ...
i really ...
i don't remember .
dude , you did something to her .
no .
oh , yeah , you did .
because she shows up at my house , at 4 in the morning , saying that she wanted me back .
she even said that if i needed more time , that she understood completely .
how fucking crazy .
chalk one up for the blokes .
thanks to me , marlon won the game .
which means he's off scot free , and so am i.
this is a bloody miracle .
that's fantastic .
fantastic .
come on , what did you say to her?
look , look .
it's all good .
come on , what did you say?
i asked her to marry me .
you know you're my best man , right?
no good deed goes unpunished .
new word for the day?
the ability to readily recover after disappointment or loss .
capacity to spring back .
understand , it's not about replacing julie .
women who mean nothing to me .
so i've struck up a friendship with a nightclub hostess called uta .
hello , uta .
now , as a heat seeking bachelor ,
i have to live by some very simple rules .
alfie elkins 'credo or philosophy , which is probably best summed up by the only advice my father ever gave me .
he said , " son , whenever you meet a beautiful woman ... ... just remember , somewhere there's a bloke who's sick of shagging her .
can i help you , man?
g and t , please .
explain to me what everyone sees in that eurotrash?
i think it's incredibly unfair that it's acceptable for men to be sexually experimental , then with a woman , if she wants to try something ...
a kiss or a threesome .
you know , that they'd be judged .
i wouldn't judge them .
and i think if you two were to kiss , i would ...
i would just ...
i would just see it as a thing of beauty .
although i'm living every guy's rat pack fantasy , something feels a bit off .
and throwing myself back into the old lifestyle isn't going quite as smoothly as i'd hoped .
sorry .
i'm sorry .
you carry on without me .
oh , my loves , i ...
i don't know what happened .
this is so unlike me .
yeah , you ...
you two just ...
i used to think there was nothing worse than death .
then , from out of nowhere ... ... the unthinkable .
now i really don't get what everyone sees in you .
it just keeps on happening and happening .
or more accurately , not happening and not happening .
this never happens , uta .
honestly , never .
honestly .
not the word around town ... ... peewee .
mr elkins?
miranda kulp .
miranda .
the penis doctor is a he with a little bit of she thrown in .
so i understand you're experiencing some erectile dysfunction .
i am experiencing a little ...
a little ...
a little bit of ...
what you just said .
not to worry .
that's my area of expertise .
so have you been under any unusual emotional stress lately , mr elkins?
stress?
emotional?
me?
no , never .
well , unless you count that recent chat i had with julie .
i can't see you anymore , alfie .
why?
you angry?
no , i'm really not angry .
just , you know , we want different things .
and i can't have you traipsing in and out of max's life .
you've changed your hair , haven't you?
you have , haven't you?
no , you have .
you've changed your hairdo .
you cut it?
it looks gorgeous .
thanks .
how come ...?
how come you never had it like that when we were together?
i really gotta go .
well , i guess ... ... you need these back .
thank you .
alfie?
you gonna be okay?
yeah .
no worries .
i'm always okay .
alrighty , let's take a gander at that penis of yours .
i see .
well .
it seems we have lift off .
it seems we do .
wunderschn .
what a relief .
well , i mean , if he can give me a stiffy , i should have no problem keeping it up for the target demographic , shouldn't i?
well , there doesn't appear to be anything physiologically wrong , so , in short , we can be fairly certain your problem
was simply stress related .
julie related .
like i always say , if they don't get you one way , they'll get you another .
however ,
i did feel something a little kooky .
kooky?
there is nothing to get upset about , mr elkins .
i thought i felt a lump ... ... on your penis .
but with any luck , it will be nothing .
the words " lump " and " penis " in the same sentence .
there's something you don't hear every day .
and so young alfred got an early yuletide gift .
a penis biopsy .
i get my test results in three days ...
well , five .
five counting the weekend .
oh , lord .
oh , lord .
how am i gonna stop myself going completely bonkers?
i'll be fine .
i'll be fine .
i'm a young man .
shift focus , alfie .
shift ...
let's go , kids .
let's go .
move along , children .
look straight ahead .
come on .
do not look at the man .
look straight ahead .
in the meantime , perhaps i'm safer hobbling on home .
alfie , dear , what's wrong?
you look like death warmed over .
no , i've just ...
i've got a bit of a football injury , that's all ,
mrs schnitman ...
hello , mrs liberman .
you two look lovely .
where you going?
shopping .
you need anything?
i'm fine .
hello .
can i talk to you for a minute?
ladies , this is my friend lonette .
she's lovely .
good for you , dating an african american .
yeah .
hey .
hey , girl .
i missed you .
don't mind us .
we're not here .
you kids keep talking .
very nice to meet you .
see you , mrs liberman .
shop till you drop , girls .
so how have you been?
i'm pregnant .
it seems to me the problems you worry yourself sick about never seem to materialize .
it's the ones that catch you unexpectedly on a wednesday afternoon that knock you sideways .
i offered to face the music with her ... ... but she wanted to go it alone .
we both knew that if the baby was born with any white boy features it would mean the end of lonette and marlon .
not to mention your host for this evening .
but standing in the cold , i find myself having regrets .
thinking thoughts like ,
here's another kid you'll never get a chance to know .
your own .
didn't take long .
bloody hell , you're freezing .
how do you feel?
empty .
that night in the bar , i thought i was getting something for nothing .
doesn't seem to have worked out that way , does it?
oh , man .
if everything turns out okay , maybe this little brush with mortality is a sign .
i should think about making ...
making some changes .
possibly .
next week .
excuse me .
did i just ...?
did you just look at me?
did i just notice you turn away?
look , if you know the results to my tests , and they're telling you ...
mr elkins .
please .
please .
mr elkins , for the millionth time , sit down .
mr belson , i have a cancellation on tuesday at 11 : 30 .
i'm gonna be fine .
i just feel it .
thank you .
goodbye .
i'll just be a minute .
or ten .
it's all right .
take your time .
i don't have a choice .
i used to pee .
now i trickle .
i'm joe .
what's your name?
alfie .
so how you doing , alfie?
hanging in .
you?
shitty .
yeah , me too .
me too .
i like the bolo tie .
oh , thanks .
i have a collection .
you know , when you're old , you learn to be patient .
yeah .
used to be i never had time for nothing .
go , go , go .
i know that feeling .
yeah .
my wife was always hawking me to take a little vacation .
hawaii .
reno .
i always said , " next year , evie , next year .
i got too much on my platter .
i always thought i'd have more time .
then one sunday night , she takes the pot roast out of the oven .
yells , " soup's on , " and slumps to the kitchen floor .
just like that .
dead as disco .
jesus , i'm sorry .
i tried picking up the pieces .
even went to waikiki alone on the 8 day cruise package she was always yakking about .
couldn't get evie out of my mind .
you find someone to love , and live every day as though it were your last .
she's all yours , alfie .
enjoy .
you all right , son?
yeah .
i hope so .
look , if you ever get bored or feel like schmoozing ... ... give me a holler .
you'll never call .
maybe i will .
all right , good .
we'll go to a bar together , hit on some chicks .
damn right .
thanks , joe .
hey .
i'm sorry about evie .
we ... ... weren't all that fond of each other ... ... but we were very close .
if you know what i mean .
i think i do .
i've been thinking a lot lately about god and death .
and how , if what they taught me in bible class is true ,
i'm really in for it .
but i won't be partying with lucifer any time soon , because my test results were negative .
i'm gonna live !
i'm gonna live !
i ruined my prada lace ups and i don't care .
don't think i've forgotten my oath to completely change my life , because i haven't .
carrot apple with a dash of wheat grass .
yep .
health is now priority number one .
business plan moves onto the fast track .
if you say so ...
tonight's preview at st. ambrose ...
no , i definitely don't want to talk .
okay , hold on , what else have i got?
okay , yeah .
all right , if we must , we must , but ...
new slate .
new beginning .
what's your name , driver?
alfie , sir .
wait here , alfie .
do you know how long you're gonna be , roughly?
you got someplace to go?
no , i was just gonna nip off
and get a cup of tea .
look , why don't you just stay put .
yea or nay?
a definite yea , i think .
really .
stunning .
wouldn't you say so , sir?
i'm sorry , didn't i ask you to wait by the car?
i reckoned i should help the lady with her packages .
definite yea?
i think .
with one minor ...
may i?
you may .
adjustment .
bullfighter .
another lifetime .
don't ask .
fifty , if she's a day .
but don't they say 50 is the new 40 , and is she not living proof?
i mean , have a look .
beautifully preserved .
and cleavage like the holland tunnel .
better?
much .
you are so right to trust chanel .
a pair of hot pink stilettos , and you're good to go .
well , aren't you mr full service?
we try .
he's getting a little pissy , isn't he?
oh , it's fine .
it's good for him .
is your husband a lot older than you?
he's not my husband .
he's wearing a wedding ring .
well , i never said he wasn't somebody else's husband .
grab the stuff from the trunk?
you got it .
cheers .
ma'am , if you require my services in the future .
happy christmas , sir .
ma'am .
now that , my friends , is a real woman .
smart and sexy and ...
you noticed the little flirt going on between us , huh?
makes me think , if a woman like that , of that calibre should take notice of a bloke like me , then , perhaps ...
perhaps i'm selling myself a bit short .
in a flash ,
i have my new year's resolution .
aim higher .
catastrophic .
doomed .
desolate .
cataclysmic .
bought him a word of the day calendar for christmas .
big mistake .
holiday season , busiest time of the year .
i try to run a business .
what's the problem , mr wing?
your soul brother .
he quit .
in the letter marlon left me , he called me his best friend ... ... but apologized for bailing on our business scheme .
he said his whole thing now was to make lonette happy .
they decided , on the spur of the moment , to move upstate , and i had a standing invite to drop by any time .
somehow lonette convinced marlon it would be too painful to say our goodbyes in person .
christmas eve .
a night that brings on all those familiar festive feelings of hopelessness , anguish , despair .
not a great time to be flying solo .
that's why i'm of the belief couples should never split up between thanksgiving and january 2nd .
always have a relationship to see you through the holidays .
always .
the downside , of course , being gifts .
personally , i've always suspected that everyone else is having a far merrier christmas than i am .
not that i've ever actually had a christmas .
that's a whole other dickens story .
taxi .
taxi .
excuse me .
i'm sorry , mate , it's against the law for me to carry any more than ...
thank the lord .
a christmas miracle .
all right , hop in .
thanks for saving us .
i was freezing my little tush off .
no worries .

merry christmastime
there's an expression the yanks use , " go with the flow .
so , yeah , i got a dose of the holiday blues .
but when a girl of this mind blowing calibre invites you to a party , it's time to get going and start flowing .
maybe it's the late hour .
maybe it's the heavily spiked eggnog .
maybe it was simply a mutual desperate desire to have ourselves a merry little christmas .
i'm renovating my apartment on the upper west side .
but , say , you could ... ... crash at my sublet , if you want .
