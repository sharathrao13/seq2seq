fred !
can you hear me?
fredster here , velms .
shockingly , daphne's been captured again .
that's okay .
when the luna ghost rounds the corner with daphne ... ... shaggy and scooby will pop out of the barrel ...
you'll activate the conveyor belt , spilling the oil onto the floor .
just remember my plan .
like , chill out , scooby doo .
stop shaking .
me?
that's you .
right .
it's me .
sorry .
scooby doo , what are you doing , man?
like , this is no time to ...

daphne , are you okay?
i'm so over this damsel in distress nonsense .
where's shagster?
like , i'm right here , man .

scoob , that was fun .
let's grab another skateboard and do it again .
yeah .
there you go .
one for you .
good iooking guy .
all right , nice to see you .
thanks for saving the factory .
pam , any comments?
this is a victory for any celebrity who wants to make a quality action figure .
what's the secret of your success?
teamwork .
i do a tremendous amount of teamwork , and i always have a plan .
come on .
yeah , my plan .
i knew from the start there was no phantom .
the luna ghost is , in fact ...
old man smithers?
the creepy janitor?
he wanted revenge after you refused to go out with him .
how could you , pam?
i'm a lover boy of george clooney an proportions .
fred , how was the ghost able to fly?
i can answer that .
watch .
these balloons fill with a highly potent helium synthesis ... ... giving the luna ghost ... ... his weightless appearance .
i would have gotten away with it too , if it weren't for you meddling kids ... ... and your dumb dog !
i'll get you for this !
scooby dooby doo !
fred , i can't believe you took credit for my plan again .
some plan .
that ghost pawed me for an hour and a half .
it's not our fault you always get kidnapped .
i don't always get kidnapped .
can't believe you'd say that .
oh , please .
you come with your own ransom note .
my glasses !
who's helpless now?
i'm going to kill you , daphne !
watch the ascot !
you guys , look , i know i'm just the dude that carries the bags ... ... but we all play an important part in this group .
i mean , we're just like a big , delicious banana split .
fred , you're the big banana .
daphne , you're the pastrami and gum flavored ice cream .
and velma ... ... you're the sweet and sour mustard sauce that goes on top .
that sounds pretty good , doesn't it?
you know what , shaggy?
you've really put it in perspective for me .
thanks .
i quit .
no .
no way .
you can't quit .
i was gonna quit in , like , two seconds .
now everyone will think i copied off the smart girl .
now , wait a minute .
maybe i quit .
i do .
yeah , i quit .
i'm out of here .
good riddance .
don't ...
no .
don't go .
come on , you guys , don't do this .
please don't go .
do i quit?
no , scoob ... ... friends don't quit .
it looks like it's just you and me for a while .
what now , shaggy?
i guess we'll all just do what we do best , scoob .
this is primo .
man , talk about toasted .
man , the only thing i like better than an eggplant burger ... ... is a chocolate covered eggplant burger .
with hot sauce .
yeah , just another beautiful day in paradise .
i'm looking for a " mr. rogers " and a " mr. doo . " the detectives?
it's probably somebody looking for us to solve some scary mystery .
nobody home !
quick , scoob o , grab the food o , let's scram o .
i'm looking for a " mr. rogers " and a " mr. doo .
let's go !
i'm sorry , dude .
i'd love to help you out .
you look like a really nice guy .
we're not detectives anymore .
i've been sent by mr. emile mondevarious to invite you ... ... to his amusement park , spooky island .
we don't go near places with " spooky , " " haunted , " or " creepy " in the name .
or hydrocolonic .
right , but that's for another reason .
but he'd like you to solve a mystery .
he'll pay you a fee of $10, 000 .
it's just , materialism is not really our bag , man .
free airfare .
no , thanks .
room and board .
no , thanks .
and all you can eat .
all you can eat?
fred?
velma?
are you going this way?
how have you ...?
been?
yes .
great .
i'm on the lecture circuit with my new book ...
the many faces of me .
jinkies , that's impressive .
and yourself?
i've been working at nasa , developing hydropowered missile defense systems .
but , more importantly ...
... i'm on a journey of self discovery .
nasa?
charter service to spooky island will begin boarding momentarily .
what do you mean i can't have seven carry on bags?
that's so economy .
crap .
oh , no .
i'm not talking to you guys .
what are you doing here?
isn't it obvious?
we all received the same letter from one emile mondevarious ... ... the reclusive owner of spooky island .
it's not fair .
i was gonna solve the mystery all by myself .
and when you get caught?
i'm a black belt now .
i've transformed my body into a dangerous weapon .
it's true .
far out .
i guess we're , like , all going to spooky island , man .
where's scooby?
hello .
sorry .
they don't allow big dogs on the plane .
you've got to be kidding .
no one is stupid enough to believe that .
who's the ugly old broad?
say hello to grandma .
aloha .
flight 3774 to spooky island , now boarding .
i wouldn't have agreed to come if i knew .
wait , just think about it for one minute .
mystery inc . reunites .
we'll be a team again , just like the old days .
only if fred and velma do it .
people are watching , shag .
yeah , scoob , " roo hoo .
come on , buddy .
now that is a beautiful work of art .
would you mind me taking a seat there next to ...?
to my grandma .
that's my grandma .
hi , grandma .
like , no .
thanks .
you're welcome .
bless you .
i'm sorry .
my allergies .
it's usually only dogs that do it .
maybe i'd better move .
no , wait .
it's probably just my grandma's perfume .
yeah , even i sometimes get a little allergic , you know .
oh , jeez .
i'm pretty sure grandma wants to go back and visit with her pal velma .
right , grandma?
okay .
boy , oh , boy , those sure do look like scooby snacks .
i know they're for dogs ... ... but they're 100 %% vegetarian , and i love them .
like , me too .
far out .
i've never met another person who loves scooby snacks .
me neither .
i'm mary jane .
like , that's my favorite name .
really?
no way .
hello .
grandma?
velma , it's simple behavior modification .
to cause a dog to discontinue any action , flick it on the nose .
observe .
scoob?
see?
sit , grandma !
bad , grandma !
don't eat the kitty !
welcome to spooky island ... ... the frightfully popular spring break spot for college students .
catch our electrical torture parade .
it's a dead world after all .
and the world famous splatterhorn .
scooby doo !
and the rest of mystery inc .
it's marvelous to see you !
how fanta ...
i'm sorry .
that's the second time this week .
thank goodness .
it's a new toy .
i'm just getting up to speed with it .
welcome .
thank goodness .
i was afraid i'd have to lug those to the hotel .
that's what spooky island's about , realizing your worst fears .
i'm emile mondevarious , the owner of this amusement park .
you seem less ...
spooky . ... than we'd have guessed .
i can be pretty spooky when called upon .
claws and everything .
you wouldn't want to run into me in a dark alley .
so you're the one who brought us here?
no .
what brought you here was your insatiable appetite ... ... for a juicy mystery .
the truth is , mystery inc . is broken up .
that's the beauty of something broken .
it can be fixed .
therein lies its potential .
and i need you to fix spooky island .
what's the problem?
i believe somebody's casting a spell on the students .
now listen and look around .
notice any difference between those arriving and those departing?
they look like sober , well behaved college kids .
precisely .
they didn't before they came .
they've changed .
in other words , a magic spell .
carol !
carol , how was the island?
are you tricking on me?
it's me , brad .
we've known each other since we were 3 .
back off my grill , son !
carol , what are you doing?
i'm terrified .
the young people that come off that barge ... ... the people i love the most , they're in danger .
i'm going to solve this one first .
not before i solve it first .
you'll look like total idiots when you're captured and i save you .
thank you .
marvelous .
maybe we can celebrate later by having a little spookapalooza .
spookapalooza?
you haven't noticed anything unusual since you started working here?
any weirdoes running around?
no .
welcome , dear victims .
my name is n 'goo tuana .
this is my evil best pal , zarkos .
you may recognize him from telemundo as the famous masked wrestler ... ... zarkos .
this enchanted island ... ... is a thoroughfare to the supernatural realm .
for centuries , it was home to creatures who lived on the island undisturbed .
but then ... ... ten years ago ... ... emile mondevarious ... ... antagonized these ancient beings by building a theme park here .
the creatures are furious , my friends .
and i assure you ... ... while you party ... ... they plot ... ... their revenge !
do my friends frighten you?
they would , if it weren't for the holographic projectors ... ... there , and there and there .
what a smart little one .
hello , dead mike's .
we got a " mr. doo " here?
i got a call for a " mr. doo .
melvin doo?
no , scooby .
hello?
got a bag ... ... of hamburgers here for you .
just walk into the dark , shadowy part of the forest ... ... where no one can see you .
okay .
want a stuffed thingy?
nobody can win those .
fred says it's a worthless talent , that i should've learned french instead .
i say you don't need to know what " voulez vous coucher avec moi " means ... ... to love that song .
i think being good at crane machine is way cooler than french .
voil .
nobody's ever given me a stuffed dismembered head before .
excuse me .
now i have to start my voodoo ritual all over again !
voodoo ritual?
i was about to sacrifice this chicken .
that chicken's not alive .
i know .
what , did you figure that out when you saw it didn't have a head?
what do you want?
why you in the voodoo ritual space?
i'm looking for clues as to who's behind the students 'strange behavior .
purple is a fall color .
it's the middle of may !
pardon?
do yourself a favor and get off this island .
go home .
go home before evil befalls your skinny , aerobicized booty .
and whatever you do ... ... do not , i repeat ... ... do not go into that spooky island castle .
you want me to go to that castle .
didn't you hear what i said?
you knew i'd do the opposite of what you said .
you told me not to go to the castle so i would go ... ... where you set a trap to capture me .
unless ... ... you knew i'd figure it out , so you told me not to go ... ... so i'd think you wanted me to go , so i wouldn't go .
i'll find out what you're hiding in that castle .
you watch .
what in the world?
hamburgers , where are you?
hamburgers .
thank you .
shaggy !
it's been really nice .
shaggy !
monster !
monster !
a monster?
scooby doo , quit goofing around , man .
i guess i should go .
bye , scooby .
bless you .
shaggy .
scooby .
no way .
scoob and me don't do castles .
why not?
they have paintings that watch you , suits of armor you think is a statue ... ... but there's a guy inside who follows you every time you turn around .
how many times did that happen?
twelve .
we're not gonna do it .
that's right .
scooby?
did you hurt your paw?
would you do it for a scooby snack?
oh , boy !
and you'll be fearless?
fearless?
hong kong phooey , watch the fists of fury .
here you go .
thank you .
there's plenty more where that came from .
let's go before someone sees .
you're not gonna stay out here alone , are you?
no , thank you .
oh , boy .
this place is , like , uber creepy .
yeah , uber creepy .
the only thing missing is a mindless zombie .
fred , get back .
i found this place .
i call dibs on its clues .
i've already found some clues .
what?
i followed some weird footprints here .
it might be dangerous for you .
if anyone messes with me , i'll open a can of chinese whoop ass on them .
what are you doing here?
this ride was closed for construction .
it's the most likely place to hatch a plan .
and i wanted to scare daphne .
since we're all together , let's split up and look for more clues .
daphne , you and i ...
typical .
what?
nothing .
i was always picked last for the teams .
okay .
daphne , exit through the entrance .
velma and i will enter through the exit .
and shaggy and scooby ... ... do whatever you guys do .
look at this , huh , scoob?
it's like a medieval sizzler .
pinch me , i'm in heaven ...
it's an expression , scoob .
sorry .
velma , i never meant to ...
well , you know ...
... pick you last .
don't worry about it .
i know you .
all you care about are swimsuit models .
look , i'm a man of substance .
dorky chicks like you turn me on too .
that's a compliment .
yes !
yes !
oh , yeah .
oh , yeah .
oh , yeah .
oh , yeah .
oh , no !
and now for our dinner show .
what?
watch out !
i got a bad feeling about this .
me too .
you !
feast on this .
jinkies .
they're moving toward us .
run !
we're trapped .
quick , try the bookcase .
one of these has to open a passageway .
velma , this is a ride .
you got a better plan?
what do we do?
eat .
it's plastic .
so what?
you drink out of a toilet .
so do you .
i'm not helpless .
i am helpless .
i'm gonna die !
we made it , scoob .
we're alive !
that was weird .
fred?
are you all right?
the last book .
i don't feel so good .
reminds me of the time we tried to eat that guy in the hot dog costume .
looks like some kind of school .
in a spooky castle ride?
fishy .
welcome to america .
i am using the language english .
shaggy , look .
let's check it out .
oh , boy .
lights , camera , action , huh , scoob?
now that you're a young adult ... ... you'll need to learn societal dos ... ... and don'ts .
interaction between young people is polite and casual .
hey , sorry , bro .
i will crush your bones into dust .
let's see how the situation should be handled .
remember , today's young people have a language all their own .
sorry , bro .
no big whoop , dog .
catch that new vid on the box?
true dat .
i'm up to sniznuff on all popular trends .
word .
it seems to be a brainwashing facility of some type .
wherever there's a brainwashing cult , there's always a power hungry leader .
the papa smurf figure .
mondevarious .
then why would he have invited us here?
jellybeans .
i'll have whatever he's having .
are you challenging me?
maybe .
pull my finger .
too late .
you're in trouble .
oh , boy .
i'm not stopping till your fur is singed off .
we're here to solve a mystery .
yeah , scoob .
let's get out of here .
zoinks !
skedaddle !
i found a neat and scary clue .
us too .
this is a brainwashing facility for an evil cult .
maybe this is the secret relic thingy they worship .
we'll all be relics if we don't get out of here .
i got a plan .
what's that smell?
sir , they found the daemon ritus .
for your sake , they better not have gone far .
it is time to summon the big muchachos .
like , oh , no !
mystery inc .
you all seem rather cheery .
good news , i hope?
mr. mononucleosis ...
yes?
we have hit a clue smorgasbord .
we have three suspects as to who's behind this evil hooty .
n 'goo tuana .
he believes your park's on enchanted ground .
the voodoo man , who tricked me into going to the castle .
and you .
me?
let's split up .
we'll meet in a half hour .
i'll interview employees to see if they've noticed anything odd .
i'll translate these inscriptions daphne found .
i'll go research cults on the net .
i'm a suspect?
don't take it personally .
it's because you creep me out .
i see .
fine .
jinkies .
hey .
your friends ditch you?
no , i always did the brainwork .
what's this?
i believe it's called the daemon ritus .
daemon ritus?
what's it for?
this describes an old race of creatures .
it's reminiscent of pandaemonous texts , so i can make some of it out .
it looks like instructions to some sort of secret ritual .
it is fascinating .
on the house .
nice sweater .
you really dig doing this , huh?
like , clues and stuff .
certainly .
really focusing on a mystery reminds me of the old days .
we were quite a crew back then .
that was the best time of my life .
shaggy and scooby ...
what goofballs !
kind of like they are today .
and daphne ...
so beautiful .
she was the coolest girl at coolsville high .
fred .
he was so handsome .
and he really knew how to accessorize .
sounds perfect .
yeah , but every family has one nut .
scrappy dappy doo !
ghosts don't stand a chance with me .
let me at 'em .
i'll rack 'em .
i'll sock 'em .
for the thousandth time , there's no such thing as ghosts .
sure there are .
when i find them , i'll give them a dose of puppy power !
oh , god .
he's peeing on me .
that little egomaniac had flipped his lid .
scrappy , i told you , no urinating on daphne .
it was an accident .
you were marking your territory .
you don't have the scrote for this job .
listen up , losers .
the time has come to appoint me your unquestioned leader .
either that , or i'm out of here .
what's the idea?
you can't do this to me .
people adore me .
i'm as cute as a powerpuff girl .
i'll get my own show .
puppy power , huh?
and he wasn't even a puppy .
he had a gland disorder .
help me !
help me !
monsters !
monsters !
this is the most embarrassing thing you've done ... ... since you cleaned your beans at don knotts 'christmas party .
how many times do i have to tell you?
there are no such things as ghouls , ghosts , goblins or monsters .
now listen up .
there is absolutely ... ... absolutely no such thing as ...
monster !
fred !
scooby ...
save daphne .
my glasses .
i can't find my glasses .
help me find my glasses .
here they are .
thank you .
nice mask .
bad breath .
here .
jinkies .
velma !
come on !
velma !
this is , like , the opposite of what i wanted to do today .
leave it !
stand back , sir .
i'll protect you .
mr. mondevarious !
daphne , go !
scooby doo , where are you?
running suitcase .
run suitcase .
run ...
thank you .
where's scooby?
i hope he's okay .
right here .
scooby dooby doo !
hey , scoob .
i have a sinking feeling these dudes aren't brainwashed cult members .
what do they want with the students?
we need to follow them .
say what?
defeat them and save fred and velma .
get out of here , let the creatures eat fred and velma .
no way .
fred and velma always figured out everything .
now it's our turn .
for the first time , they're the damsels in distress , not me .
help?
timber .
okay , i'm calling for help .
no .
i got this .
i got this .
i don't got this .
coast guard , fitzgibbon .
hello , sir .
we're on spooky island .
our friends were ... ... kidnapped .
we need someone here right away .
we do have a unit in the vicinity .
can you meet them at the pier?
all right , they'll be right there .
our friends have been kidnapped .
something messed up is happening .
is the coast guard here?
what happened to the shattered windows and busted walls?
yo , red .
the ball .
let's go .
anyone else think this is strange?
okay , we need to split up .
why?
we need to find fred and velma .
i'll go this way .
and we'll go with you .
come on , scoob .
fred?
yo , the bitch was like , " what?
and i was like , " later on !
what up , dog?
and ...
... dog .
keeping it real .
what happened last night?
we got beats like it was the lizz nizz .
you know what i'm saying , g?
no .
you hear that?
get the dog .
damsel in distress .
let go of me .
help !
hurry , get the door !
why is fred in a bad mood?
he's not in a bad mood , scoob ... ... he's a monster .
shaggy , bikes !
i know , " yikes !
no , bikes !
scoob !
shaggy , look out !
i just saw my friend beth ann .
something's wrong with her eyes .
like , hop on !
like , what a drag !
like , duck !
yes !
that was great !
are you all right?
you were great .
you too .
scooby , what are you doing , man?
mary jane is a man in a mask .
mary jane is a man in a mask?
scooby .
what are you doing , man?
step off , scoob .
shaggy , you're whipped .
i'm whipped?
yeah?
why don't you say that to my face?
okay , i will .
your mommy eats cat poop !
no , scooby doo , your mom eats cat poop !
bring it .
you want a piece of the shagster?
feel the pain , scoob .
okay .
come on !
two shots !
two shots !
me and you , me and you again .
i'll give you some right now , buddy .
scoob !
i gotta save him .
you stay here , i'll be right back .
no , shaggy .
i mean , it's too dangerous .
i've got to .
he's , like , my best pal .
friends don't quit .
scoob?
scooby doo ... ... where are you?
scoob?
shaggy .
shaggy .
shaggy !
velma .
i'll save you .
thanks , shaggy .
boy , am i glad to see you .
let me go so i can return to my body .
get out of here ... ... before they steal your protoplasm too .
i always knew you were a hero , shaggy .
jinkies !
hey , buddy .
shaggy !
someone must have spiked my root beer last night .
talk me down , man .
fred , you're a frigging protoplasmic head .
i know .
but i'm still the best iooking protoplasmic head here .
how do you drive this?
the darkopalypse's upon us .
get what you need for the ceremony .
on your right .
your left .
i'm coming , good iooking !
thank you , you've saved me .
sorry , i'm looking for my friends .
but ...
put me back , shaggy .
i'll figure a way out myself .
like , how?
i don't know .
i'll use my tongue as an oar and swim to the edge .
sorry .
yo , yo , you , yo .
what the ...?
you could use a little sunlight .
that's one part of the mystery solved .
the creatures need our bodies to survive in sunlight .
like a human suit .
spf 1, 000, 000 .
but what are they doing here in the first place?
daphne , you okay?
yeah .
but i'm not daphne !
fred?
i couldn't get to my body .
i didn't know where else to go .
it's not easy to steer when you're pure spirit .
i can look at myself naked .
oh , brother .
get your hands off me .
daphne?
he planned this somehow , didn't he?
hey , good iooking .
fred , you egocentric ...
please tell me you guys are you .
fred keeps touching me .
makes you nostalgic for the homicidal creatures .
i stole this .
i hope it helps .
the daemon ritus .
i'm me again .
yippee for you .
man , like , why am i wearing a dress?
everyone remain calm .
velma , what the heck's going on?
if i am correct ... ... due to the instability of protoplasm in the proximity of the daemon ritus ... ... we're going to continue randomly changing bodies until ...
jinkies !
... until the protoplasm realigns with the correct bodies .
i'm fred again !
daph , what's wrong with you?
don't you ever eat?
i'm me .
i'm back .
like , me too .
told you so .
oh , no .
let's go .
i guess that was the wrong ingredient .
wait .
i know how to handle this guy .
hey , you !
what're you doing?
yes .
that is masterful .
i'm doing a voodoo ritual .
i need to get the right ingredients .
the only way to protect myself is by blessing this dead arnouki beast .
they're about to perform their evil darkopalypse ritual .
darkopalypse ritual?
right .
that's what the ancient text describes .
don't open that !
they use the protoplasm in the vat as an energy source .
and the leader needs to absorb a purely good soul to complete the ritual .
legend has it , once the ritual is performed ... ... the creatures will rule on earth for 10, 000 years .
that's why i have this in my house .
to protect myself .
you have another one of those?
those creatures are taking over the world?
that is so mean .
they can't do the ritual without a pure human soul .
where will they get one?
i didn't say human .
oh , boy .
hello , puppy .
if the person behind all this needs scooby doo ...
then that person is the one who brought scooby here .
scoobert .
how are you , my friend?
sit down , please .
okay .
scooby snack?
maybe one .
we'll need some more of those .
that's me !
it certainly is .
and that's because ... why?
we love you , scooby doo .
unlike that alleged friend of yours , shaggy .
he wouldn't believe you about that nasty girl mary jane , would he?
no .
but i believe you , my friend .
and that's why i've got a very important job for you .
what's that?
that's a cat with a bobbing head .
please don't touch it .
i would like you ... ... to be a sacrifice .
a sacrifice?
if mondorajagaga wanted scooby , why'd he invite the rest of us?
it doesn't matter .
we gotta , like , go save scoob .
our area of expertise is nut jobs in halloween costumes .
we're supposed to be heroes , man .
i'm gonna eat myself a scooby snack , and i'm gonna save my best pal .
velmster?
you think i'm gonna fall for that?
giving me my own nickname?
trying to make me feel like ... ... part of the gang?
we could make a plan .
what can i do?
the only thing i'm good for is getting caught .
but you never let that stop you before .
and if that's not a true hero , then i don't know what is .
let's get jinkie with it .
okay , so we use the pulleys to tip over the vat .
daphne will open the air vents and release the disco skull .
the light will refract off the skull ...
the creatures will explode , i'll find scoob , and we'll have saved the world .
oh , no .
the ritual's beginning .
quick .
attach this to the vat .
we're here to save you .
shaggy , faster .
all systems go .

mystery inc . rides again .

but you gotta trust me now .

i do trust you .
now , look .
who's your best buddy?
shaggy .

and who's my best buddy?
scooby doo?

and we're like two trippy peas in a far out pod , man .
best buddies trust each other .

fred , can you tell us how you solved the case?
it all started when i was giving a speech on my new book and ...
and i think the velmster should take it from here .

through the combined intuitive powers of mystery inc ... ... we've discovered the real villain is , in fact , scrappy cornelius doo ... ... who sadly was corrupted by the power of the daemon ritus .
get over it !
so i got a little cranky .
it's no reason to freak out like a jerk and try to kill all of humanity .
i would've gotten away with it too , if not for you meddling sons of ...
now that mystery inc . is back together ... ... any comment on the mud bog ghoul who's been terrorizing london?
whatever the case , mystery inc . will be there .

looking for clues and kicking butt .
how groovy is this , man?
spooky island finally came through with its all you can eat deal .
