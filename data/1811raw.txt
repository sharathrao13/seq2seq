in the old days , the land felt a great emptiness .
it was waiting ... waiting to be filled up ... waiting for someone to love it ... waiting for a leader .
and he came on the back of a whale ... a man to lead a new people .
our ancestor , paikea .
but now we were waiting for the firstborn of the new generation ... for the descendant of the whale rider ...
for the boy who would be chief .
paikea .
paikea .
there was no gladness when i was born .
my twin brother died and took our mother with him .
rawiri .
everyone was waiting for the firstborn boy to lead us ... but he died ... and i didn't .
where is the boy?
son .
what's done is done .
come home .
come home .
start again .
you mean just pretend it didn't happen .
that's not what i'm saying .
you didn't even look at her , dad !
she died .
son ...
no , no , no !
no .
no , all you want is your boy .
it's all right .
that's all you want .
isn't it?
you can start again .
hey , i've got a child .
her name's paikea .
what?
you heard me .
no .
not that name .
it's paikea .
no !
porourangi ... porourangi .
porourangi !
take her away .
i told you to take her away .
no .
you acknowledge your granddaughter .
she likes you .
he'll have another child .
he just lost a child and a wife .
isn't that enough?
you give that boy some time .
you hear me?
he'll be back when he's ready .
stupid old paka .
you say the word , and i'll get a divorce , bub .
just say the word .
what'd he say to her?
same old story .
not good enough for him , is she?
he start that early with me?
you're a man .
you can handle it .
here .
better get used to it .
this one's gonna need someone to look out for her .
yeah .
all right .
my koro wished in his heart that i'd never been born ...
but he changed his mind .
hey !
you old paka !
quick !
they were quick .
must have let them off early or something .
you've been smoking .
says you .
maori women have got to stop smoking .
we've got to protect our childbearing properties .
you coming to the concert?
might .
bet she's got her best gears all laid out on the bed .
my dad's coming .
nay?
better get my flash dress out then .
how long's he staying this time?
five minutes?
longer than that .
that's good , 'cause i blinked and missed him last time .
what time's the concert , bub?
7 : 30 , and don't be late .
gee , she's bossy , that one .
and you'd have to be smoking in a pretty funny place to wreck your childbearing properties .
if you ask me the name of this house , i will tell you .
it is whitireia .
and the carved figurehead at the top?
it is paikea .
it is paikea .
no good to you , you reckon?
shh !
what are they feeding you?
you look different .
hmm .
you do too .
must be growing up .
am not .
sorry i was late .
it doesn't matter .
it was stink anyway .
oh .
gotta look my best for your brother .
hey , bro .
rawiri?
good to see you , man .
yeah , put on a bit of weight since i saw you last time .
yeah .
hey , this is my new lady .
kia ora .
kia ora .
how many of my sons you need , girl?
give us a hand with the food .
make yourself useful .
you too , pai .
come on , mate .
let these important guys have their talk , eh?
take your time .
they've been waiting for you .
been a while this time , son .
been away .
didn't you get any of my postcards?
your mother put something on the fridge .
i don't know what it was .
a bridge or something .
france , probably .
i've been spending a bit of time in germany too .
like you there , do they?
some of them do .
so , you've been busy , then?
yeah .
yeah , it's been good .
you know , i got a gallery interested .
had some good shows .
how about you?
we've been all right .
it's good to see you , dad .
it was my father's waka ... but after i was born he didn't want to carve it anymore .
he went away .
everybody did .
sorry , mum .
you've come a long way .
i think you can have a sleep in .
isn't he having any breakfast?
septic tank's blocked down at the marae .
can't somebody else do it?
eat your breakfast .
you're too skinny .
can't hardly see your bum in those pants .
thanks , ma .
thanks , ma .
your timing's spooky , boy .
nerd !
putt putt putt !
ah !
what was that for?
for the concert last night .
you have more respect next time .
that teacher of yours got herself a husband yet?
don't think so .
she still got those things on her teeth?
paka , at school we gotta do a speech on where we come from and that .
so anyway , you know how we all came on a whale?
that's right .
but where does the whale come from?
from hawaiiki .
where's that?
it's where we lived before we came here , where the ancestors are .
so , paikea came from there .
ae .
how long ago?
long time .
but how long?
see that there?
look at it closely .
what do you see?
lots of little bits of rope all twisted together .
that's right .
weave together the threads of paikea so that our line remains strong .
each one of those threads is one of your ancestors ... all joined together and strong ... all the way back to that whale of yours .
useless bloody rope .
i'll get another one .
paka !
paka !
it's working !
it's working .
i don't want you to do that again .
it's dangerous .
that's a good one .
come in .
a seat for you over there .
kia ora .
hi .
hi .
kia ora .
have you met pai's father?
porourangi ... this is miss parata from the school .
kia ora .
kia ora .
thought she'd appreciate seeing the show .
no problem .
this is some of my work from my last exhibition in germany .
start again , from the beginning .
she wants to see all of it .
all right .
yeah , like i was saying , uh ... oh , sorry .
who's that , bro?
anna .
it's a woman i've been seeing .
actually , she's pregnant .
we're expecting a child .
why didn't you tell me?
congratulations , bro .
you always get the good looking ones .
where is she?
why don't you bring her?
uh , she lives in germany , mum .
you know .
she wanted to have the child at home .
but you'll bring her back here .
yeah , of course .
well , um , bit of a visit when baby gets big .
rawiri , take miss parata back to town .
come with me , pai .
when were you gonna tell me?
the day you left?
i've been trying to tell you since i got here .
look , dad .
it's not forever .
it's just it's anna's first child , you know?
her work's there , her family .
family?
yeah , i can't expect her to move to the other side of the world .
don't you use that girl as an excuse .
you can't wait to get away .
i see it in you .
you never stay , because it hurts you to see what's happening to us .
yeah , it does .
you still walk away from it .
leave that waka of yours out there to rot .
i'm not here shoveling shit , but , dad , i'm doing my share .
did you even see my work?
did you ... did you even look at it?
you call it work .
it's not work .
it's souvenirs .
those young men you turn your back on ... they've got something to learn from you .
you've got something to offer .
don't you turn away !
yeah , you've got the privileges ... but you forget you've also got the obligations !
look at me , dad , for once in your life .
go on .
ah , you don't even know who i am .
i know who you're meant to be , who you were born to be .
oh , yeah , right .
but i failed ya , eh , dad?
yeah , because why?
i had a daughter?
well , i'm probably gonna have another daughter .
and you know what?
i'm not gonna let you treat another child of mine like that .
then take her with you !
you don't like the job i'm doing , take her !
go on !
take her !
stop it !
she's no use to me .
pai?
no , leave her .
i'll get her .
pai !
you all right?
gotta watch that koro sometimes .
big mouth of his gets away on him , eh?
he didn't mean it ... about me .
well ... you know , maybe we should think about it .
think about what?
you coming to live with me for a while .
what do ya think?
why doesn't he want me?
oh , pai , it's not you .
it's not even about you , in a way .
koro is just ... he's just looking for something that doesn't exist anymore .
a new leader?
they exist .
yeah , they do , except i think ... it's become even more than that .
in his head , your koro , he needs a prophet .
what's that?
well , somebody who's gonna lead our people outta the darkness ... and who'll make everything all right again .
only problem is , you can't just decide who those people are just because you want them to be , eh?
like my brother?
yeah .
your koro made himself believe so strongly that he was gonna be the one .
but what if he was?
and what if he wasn't?
you know , your koro , he did the same thing with me .
is that why he's so hard on you?
yep .
pretty much .
because i can't be what he wants , eh?
me neither .
you think about it , okay?
you know you'd make me really happy if you'd come and stay with me .
mmm .
just think about it .
ready , pai?
one more go .
you be good to that girl .
that's right .
you look .
i'm gonna need all the firstborn boys .
it's time they learnt .
learnt what?
when she was born , that's when things went wrong for us .
that's where we'll find the answer .
you all right?
stop the car .
pai?
what is it , pai?
can we go home now?
but why?
what is it?
what's wrong?
i have to go home .
why?
i just have to .
i know .
it's okay .
there are some discussions about the ...
paka !
i'm back .
not now , pai .
but i'm back .
i'm back .
anyway ... where does that information come from?
it comes from the books .
you shouldn't be smoking .
tryin 'to give up , aren't i?
how come you didn't go with your dad?
i did .
hmm .
for one day .
i would have gone .
when my dad gets out , i'm gonna go with him .
where?
wherever .
get outta this dump .
koro's gonna be pissed off when he sees you smoking .
no , he won't , 'cause he's not coming .
is so .
no , he's getting the school ready .
what school?
for us fellas , to teach us the old ways and that .
probably gonna be stink .
you can come on the bus if you want .
i'm waiting for koro .
but he's not coming .
i said , " i'm waiting .
when you're ready .
when everyone's here , i'll be ready .
they are here .
those boys have waited half an hour .
you tell her you weren't going to pick her up?
she could have come on the bus .
you pick her up every day for years and she's just supposed to guess?
good .
let's go .
do the welcome , bub .
go on .
what do you think you're doing?
pai .
you're a girl .
go to the back .
what did i say?
what did i say?
then leave .
go on !
for you boys , this will be a sacred school of learning .
you'll be taught in the old ways ... in all the qualities of a chief .
you will be tested for your strength ... your courage , your intelligence ... and your leadership .
paikea's canoe sank ... and he called on the ancient ones for strength .
you're going to learn that chant .
all of you .
learn it exactly .
and if you break the chant , you will suffer the utu ...
the consequences .
like what?
someone dying or something?
like your dick'll drop off .
so , hold onto your dicks .
enough .
hold onto your dick .
now , repeat after me .
the taiaha is an instrument of war ... a tool for fighting .
if you want to master it , you've got to show it respect .
hemi .
here .
peh !
pick it up .
good .
be angry .
anger's part of your battle .
you gotta learn to control it .
now , take a break .
get a drink of water .
the rest of you in pairs .
koro know you're doing that?
i'm not doing anything .
how come you're hiding around here then?
koro's cool , eh?
he's teaching us to be warriors , man .
gonna be chiefs .
we're gonna smack all those other ones .
you shouldn't have hit koro like that .
he was all right .
he was real patient , eh?
how come he won't let you do it?
girls aren't allowed .
you could sit up the back .
long as you were quiet .
i wouldn't mind .
you're not even holding it right .
your hands should be like this .
and your feet ...
like this .
go back to the school , hemi .
i said , " go .
i'll deal with you later .
i'm sorry , paka .
you gone deaf now?
somebody just apologized to you .
you don't mess around with sacred things !
she was just watching !
she was using a taiaha .
let the girl do it .
you might be the boss out there ... but i'm the boss in this kitchen .
i'll do it .
you forgot something .
hey , it's not too bad up here .
he's got a lot of rules he has to live by .
it's not fair .
i know ... but sometimes you've just got to let him think that he's the boss .
he is the boss .
hmph .
not of me .
i let him think he is , though .
what's wrong with me , nanny?
nothing's wrong with you .
you hear me?
you got the blood of muriwai in your veins , girl .
think she'd be proud of you saying things like that?
anyway , that old paka's not the only one who knows some tricks .
eh?
well , you wouldn't know it now , but before he got fat and ugly ... your uncle rawiri was a bit of a hotshot with the taiaha .
true?
won a trophy and everything .
oh , you should have seen him .
he was beautiful .
what happened?
i don't know .
he was the second son .
but he knows some things , your uncle rawiri .
don't you worry about that .
is uncle here?
out the back .
hi .
damn , girl .
what did i tell you about sneaking up on us?
i found this .
didn't know you played golf .
not golf .
taiaha .
yeah , well , this guy's playing golf .
they cut the end off the golf stick ... swing it around , and push it through there .
hey , shut up !
i was good .
that's why you're sitting here ... while your father tells a bunch of snotty nosed kids how to be chief .
poor little bastards , huh?
could you teach me?
hold up .
this was a long time ago .
so?
please?
does koro know about this?
no .
well , let's get it on then , eh?
yes !
you mean this?
it's a broom , isn't it?
yee hee !
woo hoo !
morning , dad .
hey !
there goes that little girl , pai !
move , girl !
move !
get him , pai !
go , pai !
get him , girl !
when you extend your tongue ... you're saying to your enemies ...
i'm gonna eat you .
your eyes will roll back .
your head will be stuck on the end of my stick .
feel the ihi ... the power .
make them feel the wehi , the fear .
i want the hairs on the backs of their necks to stand up .
take off your shirts .
when you slap your chests ... i want you to slap them hard .
bleh !
bleh !
scratch them .
make them bleed .
timata .
bleh !
bleh !
good , hemi .
good .
all these ancestors are watching too .
this is my dad .
come to see your boy?
yeah .
good .
hemi , you first .
hah !
hah !
girl !
where's that school?
over there .
thought you were gonna stay for the whole thing .
seen your bit , didn't i?
come meet my mates .
hey .
hey .
this is my boy .
hey .
say hello .
hello .
better watch out for this one .
did all right in there , eh?
see you later .
tonight?
next couple of days , maybe .
we're outta here .
get lost , you .
was that your dad?
get lost .
what have you done?
answer me .
it wasn't her fault .
go wash your face .
answer me , pai .
do you know what you've done?
no .
you have broken the tapu of this school ... on this marae , the one place where our old ways are upheld .
the knowledge that's been passed down from your ancestors ... from my grandfather to me , to those boys ...
it's broken !
i'm sorry , paka .
you're not sorry .
right from the beginning , you knew this wasn't for you ... but you keep coming back .
do you want me to fail?
no .
you want these boys to fail?
what have you got to say to them?
i'm sorry .
say it again .
i'm sorry .
say it till you mean it !
say it !
i'm sorry .
want me to put some more hot in?
no .
no .
you can get sick sitting in a cold bath .
what if he fails , nanny?
then he fails .
what will happen to him?
nothing will happen ... except me thinking about that divorce .
it's not koro's fault , nanny .
what's not his fault?
sounds like his fault to me .
not that i'm a girl .
not you , hemi .
rawiri .
you've all done very well .
you've shown me that you've got courage , that you're strong ... and that you can learn .
but there can only be one ... so there's one final test ... a test of your spirit .
if you have the tooth of a whale ... you must have the whale's jaw to wield it .
one of you will bring that back to me .
bubba's got a cold , and i can't swim .
it's all right , man .
hey .
give it to me .
i almost had it .
nanny?
come here .
it's not for long .
you can put your clothes in there .
and , uh , there's a lamp if you wanna read .
rawiri reckons you're pretty brainy , eh?
anyway , it's just for a little while .
he was calling to the ancient ones , asking them to help him ... but they weren't listening .
so i tried ...
and they heard me .
uncle , is this where paka lost his reiputa?
his what?
that thing he wore around his neck .
he threw it overboard .
crazy old paka .
where?
just over there .
i'll get it .
it's quiet down deep .
koro needed quiet .
that's what nanny said .
he didn't want to talk anymore .
he just wanted to go down and down .
she's been gone quite a while , eh?
nah , she's sweet .
for paka's tea .
and i found this .
got this for dad's tea .
lovely .
pop it in the sink .
pai got it .
she got this as well .
you gonna tell him?
no .
he's not ready yet .
go on .
it's for my school concert .
you're my guest of honor .
so i'll see you there , paka .
put mine there .
come on .
i want to get up in the front .
save this one for paka .
he might be held up , bub .
no , he's coming .
thank you , ladies and gentlemen .
now to finish , we have something very special .
one of our students has won , not only our own school speech contest ... but the east coast area schools ', as well .
ladies and gentlemen , please welcome miss paikea apirana .
did you know about this?
she said she had a surprise ... for him .
this speech is a token of my deep love and respect ... for koro apirana , my grandfather .
my name is paikea apirana ...
go on , bub .
and i come from a long line of chiefs , stretching all the way back to hawaiiki ... where our ancient ones are ... the ones that first heard the land crying and sent a man .
his name was also paikea ... and i am his mo ... most recent descendant .
but i was not the leader my grandfather was expecting ... and by being born ... i broke the line back to the ancient ones .
it wasn't anybody's fault .
it just happened .
who is to blame?
but we can learn .
and if the knowledge is given to everyone , we can have lots of leaders .
and soon , everyone will be strong ... notjust the ones that've been chosen .
because sometimes , even if you're the leader and you need to be strong ... you can get tired .
like our ancestor , paikea , when he was lost at sea ... and he couldn't find the land , and he probably wanted to die .
but he knew the ancient ones were there for him ... so he called out to them to lift him up and give him strength .
this is his chant .
i dedicate it to my grandfather .
she all right?
she's asleep .
that old man know she's staying the night?
if he doesn't like it , he can sleep in the road .
might be time for us to leave , eh , dear?
what is it?
you'd better come have a look .
who is to blame?
i called them and they came ... but it wasn't right .
they were dying .
hey , keep it away from the blowhole , bro .
that's it .
just around the edges .
you okay?
he died .
koro knew what it meant .
it was paikea's whale , sent to us because we were in trouble .
dad?
we've got to turn it around .
how?
get a tractor down here and some ropes .
we'll wait for the tide .
if ... if we can move it , the others will follow .
get the men .
they're stuffed .
half of them have been up all night .
they'll do it for you .
it was a test ... but for koro this time .
leave it .
you've done enough .
now !
e pana e !
e pana e !
he wanted to die .
there wasn't a reason to live anymore .
it's no use .
they're too tired .
we'll try again later .
let them rest .
come on , dear .
we'll come back .
come on .
it's gone !
where is she?
where's my moko?
where is she?
pai !
it's okay , paka .
i wasn't scared to die .
hurry up !
hurry !
let's go !
which one?
what do you mean , which one?
yes?
thank you , dear .
i've been praying to god about it .
if that little one wakes up , i'm gonna give up the smokes .
she'd like that .
wise leader , forgive me .
i am just a fledgling new to flight .
my name is paikea apirana , and i come from a long line of chiefs ... stretching all the way back to the whale rider .
i'm not a prophet ... but i know that our people will keep going forward ... all together , with all of our strength .
