we'll lure them to the carriage
that's good idea , sir
who will carry this carriage
i'll do
give me two soldiers of yongho troop
no , in this time , drive it by the person who didn't fight
no , no i'm just an interpreter
and i never drove a carriage before
he is too young , sir
it has been decided
how come it's always us , the joojin soldiers? .
why do you keep quiet , captain? .
he even didn 't know his baby
someone has to drive the carriage
put that boy on the carriage
daejung captain
we'll make them think the princess is in the carriage
wear it
please help me
you can help me , can't you? .
i am sorry
let me go with you
make a detour on the mountain , after that 'you can see the hwangho river
we will wait for you there
please take these , return to the master 's family
we will meet
take care of dansaeng
you go for the princess
never forget your duty is to protect the princess .
it's me
be sure , you return to me
stop
we will walk from here
put together your horses for them not to discover us
what if dansaeng doesn't come back? .
the mongolians are not stupid .
they 'll come after us sooner or later
i'll be right behind you
the princess isn't in the carriage
there can't be only one soldier guarding her
they are heading for the hwangho river to crosse the mountain
if so , it's impossible for us to find them
they eventually will cross the hwangho river
burn all village and the ferry beyond the mountain so make nobody cross the river yes !
what about him? .
follow and kill him
hurry , lets go
hurry , lets go
it's the mongolian soldiers
dansaeng
dansaeng
throw that robe away and run .
now
go , now !
hurry , run
go !
and run
yeosol
yeosol
yeosol
yeosol
i am so sorry
get up
i served two years against the north and two years to fighting the japanese
altogether it was four years in the military
when i got back only rat shit was in the kitchen
shit !
so i went to the head officer and hit him with my head , bang
so did they force you to choose between imprisonment or military service? .
how did you know that? .
it is so obvious
don't go back at all
i heard that there is a koryo village in beijing
i will go back no matter what
my wife is waiting for me
guess your wife is awfully pretty? .
she is like a fat bear
yet , for me , she is the prettiest one in the world
what about you? .
don't you miss your wife? .
how many times do i have to tell you? .
i'm not married , yet
i see
what happen? .
as we expected
sir , come
be patient , even if it may be freezing that is if you don't want to call the mongolian troops
it was not my intention to wake you up .
i apologize , your highness
i had a dream
i was already in the royal palace
once we cross the hwangho river , we will escort you to the castle of nanjing
daejung tells me that this group is heading towards shandong
believe me .
i will keep my word , your highness
does the carriage return to us? .
i am sure it will do , your highness
they aren't here , sir
divide the soldiers into smaller groups and search them each area
what about the people here? .
we should kill them as they have seen us
not a single soul is at the ferry check again for sure
why aren't we going down? .
first we will move under the valley
ha il
go round to check and return
what is it? .
the enemy are hiding near the ferry
kill everyone who tries to cross the river
it seems that we have to give up dungju as well as nanjing
who are they , huh? .
i didn't have any intention to bring them here
they just followed me from the ferry
now , the yuan troops will find us any moment
we should have kicked them out then
stop
stop it
don't you hear the word , 'stop '? .
i never thought i would see you here , your highness
i have something to discuss with both of you
let's cross the river when a night falls
yes ... it is too far to dungju
it would be better to go to balhae bay and find a ferry boat there
are you saying that we should cross the sea by a ferry boat? .
if you can pass through the yuan cavalry , then go by yourself after crossing the hwangho river
what if does the general insist on escort the princess to the castle of nanjing then? .
are you crazy? .
we have to return to koryo
in fact , the princess brings us all problems
besides , now it seems we have to take all those people along as well
we have a good news
five days later , we'll meet the fortress on the coast where the mlng troops are based
the princess says if we escort her and her people there she will arrange for us a boat , which will take us to koryo
let us accept her offer
do we wait for the carriage , don't you? .
do you think they will come back alive? .
nobody go back to koryo without a boat
with the mlng troops , we are safe enough
also , mlng's emperor would know what we help her
the yuan troops never give the princess up but it is true that we need a boat
i will follow your opinion , general
good
get up
but we do have to wait for the people who was in carriage
we all agreed , your highness
if your decision is out of pity , then return everything back to where it was
it is not the time for pity
prepare to leave
stay joojin troops here
you will leave when yeosol and dansaeng return
you've been in the military long enough to know what the result of disobey to a general's orders ...
general to a general's orders ... we should wait until this evening passes
dansaeng is coming
you came back alive
you're alright? . are you ok? .
i've been waiting for you so much
welcome to return
it stained with the yuan troops
i am glad you returned alive
i did not wish to award a slave such an honorable death
the noble tend to have useless thoughts
shouldn't we arrange a horse for the princess? .
she is not the princess of koryo
the princess wants to ride in a palanquin it is out of the question
get thick wood , now
it is foolish
daejung
let's carry it
hey , captain
why should we carry that thing
someone has to carry it
hurry
my soles are as parched as the back of a turtle
we don't have much time shit
i'll carry it
the morning mountain at home , white bird sing a song   i want to hear the song , wish to go back home idiot !
remember the yuan troops right behind us
i am sorry
your voice is louder than hers , monk
she's just trying to comfort the children why are you so picky? .
aren't you worried about the children? .
if you are that thoughtful , you wouldn't be playing around with the prostitute if the yuan troops catch us those children are the first victims and you are also the first one who runs off
what? .
what do you know about me? .
silly one
look at yourself
we've walked all day , but only come 1 2 kilometers
with this speed it'll take more than twenty days
brother , i don't understand at all
how can be you still alone with this age? . no one waiting for you at home? .
i really don't have anyone .
really
do you have any girl of your heart? .
ha il , you also miss your wife , don 't you? .
he's still a bachelor
how many times i told you? .
you haven't sex with a girl , don't you? .
why don't you get married until now? .
i took the wrong pills when he was young
yeah , he has still a child's
would you like to try this? .
no
hey , hey ... hey granny comes back
she is an distracted old lady
since her son was killed at the ferry no one can take care of her
how can we care about an old one like her? .
bring her here .
she is also one of my people
who are you? .
let me go
i'll carry her on my back
tens of soldiers are coming to this way , sir
did they find us? .
i am afraid so
then let's just take the princess
if we take the others along , we'll all die
he's right we'll just take the princess and yooran
we must keep the promise to the princess
we bring all of them along
the yuan cavalry are faster than the wind
even a hunter takes care of an animal who lost their way .
that's a basic moral ...
i will stay with them if you want to leave without them bastard
don't you miss your mother? .
my ma will be proud of me
let's go together , as far as we can
what don't you hurry? .
the yuan troops are coming !
the princess will start first with the joojin troops
joojin troops
order them to carry the palanquin .
now quickly
this palanquin is holding us back
general
are you waiting for the yuan troops to get us? .
they ask you for give up the palanquin
who said so? .
get out
order them to carry my palanquin at once
stop
the princess will be target by the enemy because of this palanquin
the yongho troops and i will go at them
wait here
you don 't have to go to meet them who are chasing after us
i am the one who makes a decision
you just follow my orders
let's go
in the forest , the cavalry have less advantage
let's follow me with same intervals of one meters
if you lost the distances , you will be faced alone on the group of the enemy
are you afraid? .
then , stay here until you hear something .
you can rush out then
i will go down instead of you , general
watch the hill
if they pass through here , the princess will be in great danger
on my signal , everyone rush at them
do as i said .
you hear? .
dansaeng yes
is that you? .
we'll take care of here go and protect the princess
look , the byuljang is coming
it is very important .
you should deliver it
please trust my husband
now , go
they are coming
go , hurry
be careful
move , princess
there is the princess
stand back
stop it !
don't move
take away your filthy hands , you slave
you could have killed me !
i'm a princess
stop screaming
don't think you can do anything because you are a princess
leave me alone
take this
byuljang ...
byuljang
how's your feeling? .
what about the yongho troops? .
help me up
what happened to the enemy? .
daejung wiped out them with the joojin troops , sir
what about the princess? .
she is coming this way , sir
we will resume the journey we are leaving
it is quite late and you must take rest a bit more , sir it's better leaving early in the morning , sir
i said get up
if you wish to leave , go yourself , sir
we will get some rest and then leave
i know that you are the agitator
until now , i let you have your own way
but now i will not tolerate you
leave him alone dochoong , seat down ...
general , please remove your sword
how dare you
byuljang , arrest these men at once
now
look here
how about having captain daejung as our leader from now on? .
that's only way to reach the castle won't we? .
dochoong
general ...
pass your authority to daejung
do you think you came here by yourself? .
under this hard situation
someone had to make tough decisions
do you know that? .
i made these decisions on behalf of the group
from now on , whoever bothers my way i will cut your throat under the name of the king
general , you are still in recovering ...
don't you are the one who i want to kill most
it's you
why don't you anyone detain the general? .
general , come back
you may lead these poor people , but that doesn't change our situation
do you think these all happening caused because of him? .
i am not bright enough to know the future
you should have hold onto the general
the only thing i desire most is for us all to go home
we must leave this place
your highness , did you have a nightmare? .
the clay fortress is not too far away we should prepare to leave
but your highness , everyone is asleep
don't worry too much
he couldn't have gone too far
even if he desired to come back he is a person who would never do so
this is princess buyong chased by yuan , i am heading to the clay fortress
send the soldiers there immediately
wehae !
we will go around the forest
we cannot sir
if we don't chase them now we will lose them in the woods
their destination is where the forest ends
i vowed never to return without capturing the princess we've all prepared to death when we've started the battle
the mongolian are not afraid of the death
not afraid of the death
be careful , you carry with a baby
thank you
your welcome
daejung
how are the wounds? . the poison in his body is almost neutralized
why aren't you helping the general up? .
it is not necessary !
i can get up by myself
general , get up
do not call me a general anymore
whatever you may say , you are still a general
you led the group very well .
please go with us
go with me
a well !
where are all the boats? .
what about the mlng troops? .
where is the princess? .
we came all the way because of that bitch 's words .
now what? .
it's not the princess fault
then whose fault is it? .
was it you? .
stop it who could know this kind happening? .
the yuan troops will come soon decide whether we will leave or stay
let's leave this place
close the gates
go get a bar
hurry
call a man who can speak koryo
listen !
for years , koryo has been the vassal of the great won empire
if you hand over the princess , we will let you all live
daejung , we are out matched
the princess is none of our business any more
what they want is me
you have escorted me here , so you kept your promise
you don't need to sacrifice people anymore for me
if you refuse to hand her over , we will destroy you all
daejung , you must decide
help us
uh? .
the gates are opening
the great fighter is still alive
he ruins everything
those who wish to leave may do so those who wish to stay , may stay
