there is enough whisky for all of you .
this is enough here to take a bath .
enjoy yourselves .
i'll go and get the girls .
if you don't stop , i'll bend that iron around your head .
it's all right , ain't it , morrison?
i believe it's you the boys want .
all of them .
ok .

or cattle .
i believe you have enough of the association's cattle to pay for all of us , ... without comin 'up for air ... ... the whole month of july .
no !
no !
no !
no !
no !
no !
no !
no !
no !
stay with me .
maybe you understand better the kind of people you're workin 'for now .
the tragedy , nate ... is you people were in the right ... legally .
but they just threw that away .
oh , my god !
what's goin 'on?
firin 'squad .
who gave that order?
canton .
before i could get to my feet , ... she hit on me with a log , bitin 'and stompin '.
grabbed the little bitch around the neck .
this time i had my knife .
i didn't stop cuttin 'till i felt the blood runnin '.
not in here !
i have nothing to say to you .
you better have a guaranteed warrant for every name on that list .
show me one for the man outside , right now .
major?
when the fix is equal , then justice must prevail .
shut up , billy .
you people make me sick .
let's not have any last minute sentimentalism ... ... about killing a few thieves and anarchists .
you ever kill a man yourself , canton?
mr champion , ... my grandfather was the secretary of war to harrison .
his brother was a governor of the state of new york .
my brother in law is the secretary of state .
and , to you , i represent the full authority ... ... of the government of the united states and the president .
fuck him , too .
bravo , sir !
i've had about enough of your shit too , billy .
you silly son of a bitch !
you were hired to enforce the law .
we are the law .
son of a bitch " has always been a favourite expression in this country .
is that supposed to mean you're goin 'to nate?
ella?
do you think a woman can't love two men?
sure you can .
why not?
or three .
but it sure as hell isn't convenient .
i can manage it .
can you?
even after today?
today was just the beginnin '.
do you think they'd have tried what they did if it wasn't?
if somethin 'bigger wasn't comin '?
everything i have in the world is here .
i can't just walk out and leave it .
this?
this junk?
jesus christ , ella .
these are just things !
the world's full of things .
i can buy you all the things you want .
you'll never understand .
spare me that , will ya?
christ , the piety of a whore .
what does piety mean?
a dumb whore .
those are my books .
i can see what they are .
balanced to the penny .
i don't care about that now .
i do .
i never cheated on you .
i always made nate pay .
that was all a nice game , ella .
but it's over .
he asked me to marry him .
ella , i'm askin 'you again to leave .
i'm beggin 'you .
i do care for you .
i'm grateful to you , jim , for everything .
and i love you ... ... for it .
try to believe my feeling for you ... ... and my debt to you for the ... protection ... ... in the beginning and now remains unchanged .
what else can i tell you?
it is nate , isn't it?
you're a hard man to compliment .
well , you take it all .
both of you .
it's more your country than mine anyway .
goodbye , ella .
i'm gonna miss you .
jb .
have a last drink with me .
i hate gettin 'old .
why , make yourself at home .
is everybody here?
yeah , all except for the idiots who want to fight .
we are not all ... anarchists and ... criminals here , averill .
we're ...
we're storekeepers .
merchants .
why'd you come here?
we want you to talk to them .
to offer to help turn in the people on the list .
they have the law on their side .
even the national guard can't help us .
the law is the law .
see , whatever it is , it is .
it's your job !
you look like a man about to shit a pumpkin , charlie .
i don't have to take that , averill .
i'm the mayor here .
you're out now .
you're fired .
they're 50 men , charlie .
together , you're 200 .
your hopes are exaggerated .
in the end , they will get it all anyway .
and if it takes 100 years ... but they will get it !
but what about right now , charlie?
right here .
sorry .
i ...
i'm afraid you've misjudged us .
you can't fire me , charlie .
but i just quit .
good morning !
good mornin '.
i was just gonna take a bath .
are you takin 'a bath too?
oh , shit .
you know him?
never seen him before .
how many are in there?
nate champion?
we're wastin 'time here .
these two don't matter any more .
they're resting the horses anyway .
it'll be good for discipline .
you oughta understand that better than anyone else .
you're the professional army man .
i'm the amateur .
you go in there ... and tell them they're completely surrounded ... ... and they must surrender immediately .
if you come back out , we'll hold our fire till you're clear .
you have one minute .
aaaagh !
it's comin 'in like hail !
jesus christ !
ella !
i got it !
jesus christ !
nate !
i got that loud ... ... son of a bitch !
i reckon that man has killed himself .
goddamn you !
christ !
we should have gone right into town .
we all wanna hold together .
to push ourselves ahead , to protect what we have .
there's no use in either lyin 'down or givin 'up .
he says that ...
... he quit this morning ... ... the employment of averill .
jim averill came here to protect people's rights .
averill is still his friend .
there is only one crime in this country , and that is to get caught !
no !
they are opposed ... ... to anything that would settle and improve things in this country .
or try to make it something more than ...
cow pasture .
cow pasture ... for ... for ... ...
eastern speculators .
they ... advanced the idea that poor people ... ... have nothing to say in the affairs of this country .
they're here !
they're here .
they're already here !
we're going to shoot all the sons of bitches !
and even the army won't save them !
he's dead !
say something , goddammit .
what?
i told you so?
well , i told you so .
he loved you .
he thought you were his friend .
i'm not responsible .
he knew what was comin 'and he made his own decision .
and so did you .
they just voted against you , charlie !
your fears are unfounded !
somebody , please !
we need a physician !
ella !
you're goin 'the wrong way !
this way !
ella ...
go home !
mount up !
boy !
they're comin '!

i ... ... just want to live .
it don't look as if there's much chance of my getting away .
i hope they did not hurt ella .
the house is all fired .
goodbye , ella and jim , if i never see you again .
nathan d champion .
are you all right , ella?
wait for me at your place .
is really good work .
where did you get the idea for this?
romans used 'em somethin 'like 2, 000 years ago ... ... on terrain just about like this .
go !
those goddamn romans .
go !
averill , you son of a bitch , we're gonna hang ya .
go !
keep goin '!
deborah , stay down !
everyone together !
i think my legs are broken !
these men are under arrest by military authority !
you can all go home now !
frank ... you know these men are under the jurisdiction of civil authorities .
well , ...
i have here a telegram from the governor ... ... stating in the most positive terms ... ... that only immediate and drastic action ... ... on the part of authorities outside and above county officials ... ... can reduce the current state of almost anarchy in johnson county .
almost anarchy?
let me take them outta here peacefully , or you'll be shot for insurrection .
rescuin 'was what you're doin '.
i told you , jim , it's not me that's doin 'it to you .
it's the rules .
company , move out !
follow about !
damn you !
ella !
ella .
