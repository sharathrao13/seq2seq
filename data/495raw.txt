hon?
whoa , hey .
hello .
hey , baby .
how was your shift?
hi , baby .
it was great .
been drinking?
yes , i had a few drinks with the boys .
what's the matter?
i saw you on the news , jack .
linda , what is wrong?
i saw you on the news , jack .
dangling from a rope !
how could you tell me that it's not dangerous?
i didn't say it wasn't dangerous .
when we talked about it ...
i asked you , and you said it wasn't dangerous .
i said it wasn't any more dangerous than being on the engine .
i never said it wasn't dangerous .
do you see me right now?
do you?
'cause this isn't just about us .
have you thought about that?
don't .
don't .
i'm sorry .
i'm scared .
i can't sleep .
i keep having that dream ... ... about the red car turning up in front of the house when you don't come home .
i'm sorry .
don't .
i saved that man today .
did i miss it?
they just took her to the delivery room .
is she ok?
she's fine .
aah !
aah !
hey , chief .
yeah , jack , go ahead .
chief , it's getting pretty unstable in here .
i got all sorts of shit falling down around me .
i understand .
now , jack , listen up .
ok .
can you identify anything around you?
there's a sliding access door to my left .
but i can't get to it .
there's too much debris .
chief , the problem is every floor eight through eleven are identical .
well , look , if the collapse happened here , and he's anywhere near this control room ... ... if we can get him in here , it could buy us some time .
my best guess is that he's right about here in this area .
and if he can break through this wall and get into the control room ...
right , right .
and if my guys can get through the debris ... ... they can meet here , and go down the back stairwell .
might work , chief .
ok , now , look , jack , this is very important .
right behind you there's a wall .
behind that wall is a control room .
ok?
if we can break through that wall , we can buy some time .
can you do that?
i'll give it a shot .
where do you need us , chief?
i need two men up there on eight , helping ladder 17 .
and i need a two and a half inch supply line right now up on eight .
go .
copy that , chief .
ladder 49 , i need a situation report .
the progress is that we're working on it , chief .
i need another blade !
sir , there's no way to tell .
it's tough .
all hands are working .
just keep at it .
copy .
go .
just give me another saw .
we need a saw !
get me a saw !
gotta make a wish first .
i wish for a barbie car .
no , you're not supposed to say it out loud .
but won't i get it now?
blow out the candles , baby .
we'll open your presents in a minute .

but new skin grows back in its place .
tommy's face got burned , but his skin will grow back .
does it hurt?
yeah , when it happens .
i don't want you getting hurt anymore , dad .
well , we're trained not to get hurt , nick .
and long before you were even born , i was trainin '.
but , uh , you know , sometimes things do go wrong ... ... like with me and alex's dad .
but , you know , we're not afraid , because we do it to save people .
you know , it's worth it to save people , isn't it?
yeah .
and you know , if things do go wrong ...
i got your uncle mike and all my friends at the firehouse .
you know they'd never let anything happen to me .
yeah .

how are linda and the kids?
you know , it's tough .

we were divorced nine months later .
but you're different .
you're a good father .
you worry .
but you should worry .
you know , maybe it's time for a change of scenery .
yeah , what does that mean?
well ...
i was thinking ... ... there's this , uh , job down at headquarters .
there's this aide's position that i can put your name in for .
are you saying i need to get out of the firehouse?
well , i'm saying that you should ask yourself that question .
maybe go home , talk to linda .
you know , be honest with yourself .
there's nothing wrong with moving on .
i did it .
so , what did he say?
mike offered to take me with him as an aide .
what does that mean for us?
well , i'll be home nights , unless they call me in .
and , uh , 70 cents an hour increase in pay .
no fighting fire .
is that what you want?
i don't know .
um ...
you know?
things have been ... so crazy lately and ...
you know , the kids are scared , and i see you upset ... ... and , uh , you know , it's my fault .
so this is about me and the kids again , is it?
look , we've been married ten years .
and what you do is hard for me sometimes .
and i do get scared .
but i deal with it .
'cause i'm proud of you , baby .
you know , mike asked me tonight ... ... if i still love the job the way i did .
and , for the first time in my life , i didn't know what to say .
... from midnight through the current hour ... ... how this has been progressing on into our area .
and you can see just at the midnight hour ... ... in and around the immediate baltimore metro area ... ... we already have winter storm warnings ...

ladder 49 to command .
we're through the debris .
and conditions deteriorating rapidly !
ladder 49 , there's a control room straight ahead .

you hear me?
i will .
command to all units .
evacuate the building immediately .
truck 16 checking in here , chief .
uh , all units reporting clear .
the building's clear .
we're all out .
copy that .
it's never an easy thing ... ... saying goodbye to a brother firefighter .
it's not .
and this time particularly is difficult for me ... ... because i watched jack grow into a ... ... well , into one of the finest firefighters i've ever known .
he joined this department because he wanted to help people .
who knows how many homes are still standing because jack was there ... ... or how many lives were spared?
he gave his life for that cause .
we'll never forget you , jack .
and we're better for having known you .
tomorrow , when that bell rings ... ... we will be back on the truck ... ... because you were the bravest of the brave .
people are always asking me ... ... how is it that firefighters run into a burning building ... ... when everyone else is running out?
well , jack , you answered that question ... ... by saving another man's life .
your courage is the answer .
and today we will be as brave as you ... ... by not mourning you , but by celebrating your life .
so i'd like everyone to stand up and celebrate the life ... ... of jack morrison .
thank you .
