the woman fucking hates him , and doyle detests frank , and my father's allergic , so ...
saving him ... saving him ...
i swear to god , the best thing i ever did in my life was save that little son of a bitch
'cause every day that he's had since then , that's because of me .
you know what?
will you take him home?
will you give him a home while i'm gone?
i'd be honored .

i've got a nice girl .
i know , i know .
tonight is special night .
last night as free man .
i pick her out special just for you .
the last girl you picked out special for me had three teeth , all in the back .
funny you should say that .
why?
why is it funny i should say that?
what you say , it was funny .
kostya , you can't ... when you ...
it's an expression .
if you say that ...
it's a , uh , euphemism , right?
can you explain this?
you're the english teacher .
uh ...
i think what he means , kostya , is that when you say ,
funny you should say that , " that means that it reminds you of a funny story .
exactly .
no , no .
it was funny what you say ...
funny you should say that .
it still makes no fucking sense .
this is what i deal with .
i'm with you .
see?
perfectly clear .
come .
you see her .
i don't think so .
naturelle , she's dancing right out here .
we go quick .
you must see this bitch .
why don't you just find some nice girls for my friends here?
frank?
nah , i'm good , good .
i'm fine .
let's just go down .
come with me .
i'm good .
no , no , no .
forget that .
i gotta talk to you for , like , five minutes .
all right .
you want me to stay here?
yeah , someone's gotta look out for naturelle and , you know , your ... your field trip .
should i tell nat that you're having sex with prostitutes?
no , don't say this .
tell her whatever you want .
just don't go away , all right?
hang out a minute .
we'll go uptown and get doyle .
so , what time you wanna hook up?
i get off at 4 : 00 .

give me five minutes .
remember , they're waiting .
i know they're waiting !
give me five fucking minutes !
okay .
she looks good in silver , huh?
yeah .
you know , naturelle ...
i've told you this , right?
she's the only girl i've ever kept fantasizing about after i slept with her .
is that normal?
that's a pretty good kind of normal .
hey , fellas .
tomorrow , huh?
that's right .
nothing but a catnap .
stay cool , brother .
fuck .
fuck .
how you doing , brother?
you all right?
six months , you know .
come on , now .
six months before i got pinched ,
i was gonna come to you with the loot ... put me in some stocks , put me in some mutuals .
don't do this .
i'm gonna kick back , watch my coin multiply .
we're gonna get rich together .
you know , monty , you shouldn't talk like this .
i just thought , " no , you know ,
i can take out a little more to live on , a little more .
i got greedy , greedy .
i just fucked myself .
man , you're gonna wrap yourself around in a twist , you keep thinking about this shit .
that's all i can do is think about it .
i'm not gonna make it , frank .
yes , you will .
there's a thousand guys up there who are harder than me .
i mean , in a room , some junkie doesn't want to pay me , and kostya behind me , i'm pretty scary .
up there , i'm a skinny white boy with no friends .
those guys are gonna use me up and end me .
no , they won't , man .
you know why?
because you're smarter than all of them .
you're gonna get up there , you're gonna keep your eyes open and your mouth shut .
you're gonna know the names , the whole scenario .
you're gonna have the place wired in a week .
the place is overcrowded .
they got bunk beds lined up in the gymnasium to handle the overflow .
i'm going in a room with 200 other guys , frank .
so picture this ... first night , lights out .
guards are moving out of the space ,
iooking back over their shoulders , laughing at me ,
you are miles from home .
door closes , boom ...
i'm on the floor ,
i got some big guy's knee in my back .
i can give it a little go , but there will be too many of them .
someone takes a pipe out from under a mattress , starts beating me in the face ... not to hurt me , just to knock all my teeth out so i can give him head all night , and they don't have to worry about me biting .
let's say i make it through 7 years minus 84 days for good behavior .
w what then?
what kind of skills do i have?
i can't get a job in the straight world .
i can't go back to doing this .
it's 15 years to life for a second pinch .
i mean , i ...
i'm gonna be a 38 year old punked out ex con with government issue dentures .
38 is still young .
you're gonna get out , and you and me , we're gonna start something up ... you know , a fucking bar .
we're two irish kids from brooklyn .
where the fuck would we be without a bar , right?
how can we not have a bar?
come on , we have free hot dogs on " monday night football , " you know?
we got an old jukebox in the corner .
green beer on st. patty's day .
fuck green beer , frank .
you've been working 15 years to get away from green beer .
god , i hate this shit , too .
i'm just saying we got options .
i appreciate the thought .
i don't see it , man .
seven years , you're gonna be running your own show .
i don't see you working with me .
we've known each other since we were 3 .
have i ever broken a promise to you , huh?
have i ever once broken a promise to you?
have i ever said i'm gonna be somewhere and not shown up?
no .
i'm gonna be there when you get out , you hear me?
i'm gonna fucking be there .
i know you will , i know you will , but you're not gonna be there tomorrow , and it's all about tomorrow .
listen , i got one idea , one way i might buy myself a little room to breathe , but i need a big favor from you .
cool .

mm hmm .
keep an eye on monty tonight , would you?
try to stick with him .
what's the matter?
he's just acting ... really strange .
he's going to prison in a couple hours .
how do you want him to act?
i want him to act like he's scared .
well , he is scared , naturelle .
believe me , he's scared .
i just don't want him to hurt himself .
so will you watch him for me?
i don't think he wants me here .
why?
why wouldn't he want you here?
you see the way he looks at me lately?
it's like he doesn't trust me .
what reason does he have not to trust you?
i'm gonna go up top , francis .
so when you see him , just ...
cool .
i got it .
hey .
are you all right?
how could he do this , huh?
just throw it all away?
i'm his oldest friend .
what'd i do to stop it?
what'd i say to him?
nothing .
not a word .
when he started selling weed to the kids at coventry ,
i didn't say shit .
everybody's talking about buying from monty , you know , the whole school , and i knew they were gonna nail him , i knew it .
i didn't say a word .
fucking last 10 years , i've been watching him get deeper and deeper in with these friends of his , these fucks who you wouldn't want petting doyle .
and did i say , " hey , careful , monty , you better cool out , man "?
i didn't say shit .
i just sat there and watched him ruin his life .
and you did , too , all right?
we both did .
we all did .
monty never listens .
uh huh .
you know how stubborn he is , okay?
i told monty he should quit a hundred times .
did you?
was that before or after you moved into his apartment?
of all nights , please not tonight .
just don't start .
who paid for the apartment?
i need a drink .
j. d. , shot .
was that before or after he gave you that platinum necklace?
do you want to watch your mouth?
who paid for the cartier diamond earrings ... this silver dress you're wearing?
paid in full by the addictions of other people .
back up .
that's what i'm saying .
you two fly down to san juan , first class all the way .
what do you think paid for puerto rico?
you've never been to p ...
listen to me .
you've never been to p. r. in your life before monty .
you told him to quit?
the hell you did , naturelle .
back up .
you knew the deal the minute you met him .
come on .
you never had a real job in your whole life .
you've been living off the fat of the land .
and you never said a goddamn word .
who are you to get all righteous with me?
huh?
did you disown him?
you're his best friend , and you never said a thing .
but this is my fault?
i'm the evil one?
i never took his money .
never once , not a red ...
how long have you been saving this , huh?
i came over here to talk to my friend francis .
one minute ago , you were my friend .
are you drunk?
tell me you've been drinking too much .
you're fucking drunk .
i'm irish .
i can't get drunk , all right?
i know exactly what i'm saying .
seven years from now , i'll be at the prison gate .
you'll be married to monty .
right or wrong?
right or wrong?
what is wrong with you?
you want me to be the bad guy?
fine , i'm the bad guy .
are you happy now?
god , francis .
all i'm saying ... is you knew where he hid the money .
you knew where he hid the drugs , didn't you?
what the hell are you saying?
what the hell are you saying right now , francis?
you know exactly what i'm saying .
i told monty when he first met you , but he wouldn't listen to me .
i told him , " naturelle riviera ... she ain't nothin 'but a spic skank skeezer .
nat .
i've been looking all over for you .
another one?
here you go .
is she all right?
can we get out of here?
nope .
we gotta wait for monty .
i kissed her .
you what?
my student , i ...
i kissed her .
who you trying to be ...
r. kelly?
i kissed my 17 year old high school student .
jake ... have a drink .
shut the fuck up .
excuse me .
could i ... could i have a water?
fuck that .
hit him .
hit him .
okay .
i don't want to drink anymore , frank .
give him the whiskey .
shut up .
drink it .
montgomery , how's the party?
nice .
thanks for setting it up .
the first time i went to prison ...
i was 14 years old .
skinny little boy ... very afraid .
by the time i came out , i had a beard .
i was grown man .
i went back to my hometown .
i found my mother .
i kissed her .
and she screamed .
she didn't recognize me .
i have been in three different prisons , montgomery .
three different countries .
and you know what i learned?
i learned prison is a bad place to be .
seven years is a long time .
some men would do anything to avoid seven years in prison .
your father is a hardworking man .
where's his bar?
staten island?
2192 bay street?
he drives in from bay ridge ... a 1986 jeep grand wagoneer .
should i tell you how many miles he has on the car?
your father ...
i like your father ... a hardworking man .
he's had bad luck .
everyone in the neighborhood loved your mother .
da?
yeah .
everyone said she was a beautiful woman .
i want to help your father .
i could use a man like that , a hardworking man , a man i could trust .
i could take care of your father .
do you understand what i mean , montgomery?
you don't have to do this .
you don't ...
i never said anything to anybody , okay?
leave my father out of it .
i asked you a question , montgomery .
yeah .
i understand exactly what you mean .
i have a good job for your father .
we'll help him with the money he owes .
no , thank you .
good weapon .
accurate .
and reliable .
no jams .
have you ever fired a gun?
at someone , i mean .
no .
it's a toy for you .
not toy , a prop .
a prop for you , like an actor .
am i wrong?
with the gun , you feel more ... dangerous .
i wouldn't know .
it's not mine .
i didn't say anything .
i never said anything , nikolai .
i swear to god .
they came after me to get to you .
i know that .
you know that .
they tried .
i never said anything .
i believe you , montgomery .
this is my advice to you ... when you get there , figure it out who's who .
find the man nobody's protecting ... a man without friends ... and beat him until his eyes bleed .
let them think you are a little bit crazy , but respectful , too .
respectful of the right men .
you are a good looking boy .
it won't be easy for you .
but remember , i was 14 when i first went .
i tattooed " survive " on my hand the night before i went away to prison .
and i did .

i don't want you coming up there to visit me .
no .
i want you to be happy , so i want you to forget about me and live your life .
mnh ...
i figure we take the henry hudson to the sprainbrook parkway , then to the taconic .
that should get us there .
easy drive to otisville .
ow .
aw , jesus , look what they did to you .
i tell you what , monty , it's gonna be okay .
it looks bad , i know it .
but when the swelling goes down , it's gonna be okay .
yeah .
them hooligans sure give you a licking , though , huh?
how many were there?
i don't know , pop .
there was a bunch of 'em .
you get some good shots in?
yeah , i got some good shots in .
ah , give it a month .
you'll be better looking than ever .
hey , pop ...
you were right .
it wasn't her .
it wasn't naturelle .
of course it wasn't naturelle .
cool dog .
cool dog .
give me the word , and i'll take a left turn .
left turn to where?
take the gw bridge and go west .
get you stitched up somewhere and keep going .
find a nice little town .
on the way , stop in chicago for a cubs game .
you always told me you wanted to see wrigley field .
dad ...
i'm saying that if you want it ... if that's what you want , i'll do it .
no , they'd take your bar .
my bar .
jesus .
my bar .
they can take my bar to hell and back .
you think my bar is more important to me than you , my only child?
give me the word , and we'll go .
they'll find me .
they'll find me sooner or later .
you know how they find people?
they find them when they come home .
people run away , but they usually come back .
that's when they get caught .
so you go ... and you never come back .
you never come home .
we'll drive .
we'll keep driving .
head out to the middle of nowhere .
take that road as far as it takes us .
you've never been west of philly , have you?
this is a beautiful country , monty .
it's beautiful out there .
looks like a different world ... mountains , hills , cows , farms , and white churches .
i drove out west with your mother one time before you was born .
brooklyn to the pacific in three days .
just enough money for gas , sandwiches , and coffee , but we made it .
every man , woman , and child alive should see the desert one time before they die .
nothing at all for miles around , nothing but sand and rocks and cactus and blue sky .
not a soul in sight .
no sirens , no car alarms , nobody honking at you , no madman cursing or pissing on the streets .
you find the silence out there .
you find the peace .
you can find god .
* ye'll take the high road and i'll take the low road *
* and i'll be in scotland afore ye *
* but me and my true love will never meet again *
* on the bonnie , bonnie banks of loch lomond *
so , we drive west .
keep driving till we find a nice little town .
these towns out in the desert ... you know why they got there?
people wanted to get away from somewhere else .
the desert's for starting over .
find a bar , and i'll buy us drinks .
two .
i haven't had a drink in two years , but i'll have one with you .
one last whiskey with my boy .
take our time with it ... taste the barley , let it linger .
and then i'll go .
i want you to keep that .
i'll hold it for you .
i'll tell you , " don't ever write me .
don't ever come visit .
i'll tell you , " i believe in god's kingdom ,
and i believe i'll be with you again and your mother , but not in this lifetime .
you get a job somewhere ... a job that pays cash , a boss who doesn't ask questions .
and you make a new life and you never come back .
monty , people like you .
it's a gift .
you make friends wherever you go .
how you fellas doin '?
two beers .
you're gonna work hard .
you're gonna keep your head down and your mouth shut .
you're gonna make yourself a new home out there .
here you go , james .
thanks a lot .
you're a new yorker .
that will never change .
you got new york in your bones .
spend the rest of your life out west , but you're still a new yorker .
you'll miss your friends , you'll miss your dog , but you're strong .
you got your mother's backbone in you .
you're strong like she was .
hey .
you find the right people , and you get yourself papers .
why don't you go ahead and have a seat?
a driver's license .
what's your name?
uh , james .
james .
not from around here , are you?
no , i'm from out west .
well , let's go ahead and get your picture .
be still .
give me a smile .
okay .
why don't you give me a bigger smile , james?
come on , big , bigger .
okay .
you forget your old life .
you can't come back .
you can't call .
you can't write .
you never look back .
you make a new life for yourself , and you live it .
you hear me?
you live your life the way it should have been .
and maybe ...
this is dangerous , but maybe after a couple of years , you send word to naturelle .
mmm .
oh .
4 ...
3 ... 2 ... 1 .
happy new year .
happy new year .
mmm .
feel that right there .
your mother's a lunatic .
hurry up .
i need company .
you get yourself a new family , and you raise them right , you hear me?
give them a good life , monty .
give them what they need .
you have a son .
maybe you name him james .
it's a good , strong name .
and maybe one day , years from now ,
long after i'm dead and gone , reunited with your dear mother , you gather your whole family together and tell them the truth , who you are and where you come from .
we were in new york together .
you tell them the whole story .
i was arrested .
and then you ask them if they know how lucky they are to be there .
all of you ...
it all came so close to never happening . ... came so close to never happening .
this life came so close to never happening .
