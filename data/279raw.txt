look , what is this?
i am supposed to ..
i am zao .
you .. are late .
mr. van bierk .
i am looking forward to this meeting .
me too .
my african military friends owe you many thanks , colonel moon .
few men have the guts to trade conflict diamonds ... since the un's embargo .
i know all about the un .
i studied at oxford and harvard .
majored in " western hypocrisy " .
with your modest little collection of cars , i would never have guessed .
show me the diamonds .
show me the weapons .
hiding weapons in the de militarized zone it's a bit of a mine field out there .
america's cultural contribution .
one million land mines ... and my hovercrafts float right over them .
rpg's , flame throwers , automatic weapons and enough ammunition to run a small war .
my diamonds .
don't blow it all at once .
no , i have special plans for this consignment .
his name is james bond .
a british assassin .
mr. van bierk , let me show you something .
our new tank buster .
depleted uranium shells , naturally .
naturally .
how do you propose to kill me now?
mr. bond .
it's pathetic .
you british still believe you have the right to police the world .
but , you will not live to see the day all korea is ruled by the north .
then you and i have something in common .
saved by the bell .
my son is dead .
i don't condone what they do here .
tell it to the concierge .
still you jest .
defiant to the last .
your people have abandoned you .
your very existence denied .
why stay silent?
it doesn't matter any more .
things are out of my hands now .
we've reached the end , mr. bond
spare me the unpleasantries .
50 years after the super powers carved korea in two ... and then you arrive .
a british spy .
an assassin .
and now the hardliners have their proof we cannot trust the west .
you ... you took away my son .
you firing squad should have done the job for me .
i hoped ... a western education would help him become a bridge between our worlds .
but all it did was to corrupt him .
let's get this over with , shall we?
my son had an ally in the west .
for the last time , who was it?
who made him betray his country and his name?
the same person who betrayed me .
turn around .
start walking .
keep walking , please .
keep moving !
zao ...
i'm being traded ...
for you .
your time will come .
not as soon as yours .
keep walking , please .
look at him .
you'd think he was some kind of hero .
let's go .
no biological agents in the prelim scan .
he's clean .
pulse 72 .
blood pressure 120/ 80 .
indications of neurotoxins , histamines , serotonin and enzyme inhibitors .
scorpion venom .
note also traces of a venom anti serum .
they d sting and then administer the antidote .
yet his internal organs seem unaffected .
liver not too good .
it's definitely him then .
good morning .
welcome back .
such hospitality .
you don't seem too pleased to see me .
if i'd had my way you'd still be in north korea .
your freedom came at too high a price .
zao .
he tried to blow up a summit between south korea and china .
took out three chinese agents before he was caught .
now he is free .
i never asked to be traded .
i'd rather die in prison than let him loose .
you had your cyanide .
i threw it away years ago .
what the hell is this all about?
the top american agent ... in the north korean high command was executed a week ago .
the americans intercepted a signal from your prison naming him .
and they think it's me?
you were the only inmate .
they concluded you cracked under torture and were hemorrhaging information .
we had to get you out .
and what do you think?
with the drugs they were giving you , you wouldn't know what you did or didn't say .
i know the rules .
and number one is " no deals " .
get caught and you're given up .
the mission was compromised .
moon got a call exposing me .
he had a partner in the west , even his father knew about it .
whether that's true or not , it's irrelevant .
no .
it isn't .
the same person who set me up then , has just set me up again to get zao out .
so i'm going after him .
the only place you're going is our evaluation center in the falklands .
00 status rescinded .
along with my freedom?
for as long as i deem necessary , yes .
you are no use to anyone now .
he's gone into cardiac arrest .
notify his superiors , now !
he's flatlining ...
stand by ... 200 joule ... 300 .
get me some atropine .
you're loosing him !
stand back ! ...
clear !
i'm checking out .
thanks for the kiss of life .
security breach on level 3 .
all personnel , code red .
apprehend and detain with force .
my usual suite , please .
do you have a credit card?
or any luggage , sir?
mr bond .
so good to see you .
it's been a long time .
mr. chang .
perhaps you could send up my tailor?
and some food .
the lobster is good .
with quail's eggs and sliced seaweed .
and if there's any left , a '61 bollinger .
of course .
been busy , have we , mr. bond?
just surviving , mr. chang .
just surviving .
i am peaceful fountains of desire , the masseuse .
i come with compliments from the manager .
i'm sure you do , come in .
on the bed please , face down .
yes , of course .
i'm not that kind of masseuse .
i'm not that kind of customer .
you think i haven't always known you're chinese intelligence , chang?
hong kong is our turf now , bond .
yeah , don't worry about it .
i'm not here to take it back .
put your hands down ..
what the hell do you want?
just to help you settle a score .
zao killed three of your men .
you get me into north korea , i'll take care of him for you .
what's in it for you?
a chance to get even .
zao has information i need .
i'll have to ask beijing .
do it .
now get out of here .
unless you really want to give me a massage .
ah , mr. bond .
a little thank you , from us .
cuba?
it seems mr. zao has lost himself in havana .
if you find him , say good bye from us .
with pleasure .
i am here to pick up some delectados .
we haven't made delectados in 30 years .
i'm universal exports .
check with your boss .
your passport , seor?
i come to think the delectados would never be smoked .
they are particularly hazardous for one's health , mr ..
bond .
mr. bond .
do you know why?
it is the addition of the volado tobacco .
slow burning .
it never goes out .
just like a sleeper .
sorry for the rude awakening .
i love my country , mr. bond .
i'd never ask you to betray your people .
i'm after a north korean .
a tourist?
a terrorist .
one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter .
zao has no interest in other people's freedom .
i still have some friends in high places .
favors called in .
some dollars spread out .
we found your friend is here .
on an island .
in los rganos .
there's a strange clinic run by dr. alvarez .
he leads the field in gene therapy .
increasing the life expectancy of ... our beloved leaders .
and of course , the richest westerners .
we may have lost our freedom in the revolution , but ... we have a health system second to none .
you don't seem to have done too badly under the revolution .
we all have our ways of getting by .
you'd be surprised how many government officials come to me ... for little reminders of the decadent times .
mind if i borrow these?
please .
my sources tell me this zao is very dangerous .
i wish i could give you more help .
i could use a fast car .
mr. crew , your admittance papers for the alvarez clinic tomorrow .
about bloody time , fidel !
now round up some more girls , and take them to room 42 .
unless you want to be known as fidel castrato !
magnificent view .
it is , isn't it?
too bad it's lost on everybody else .
mojito?
you should try it .
jacinta johnson .
my friends call me jinx .
my friends call me james bond .
jinx , you say?
born on friday 13th .
you believe in bad luck?
let's just say , my relationships don't seem to last .
mmm .
i know the feeling .
you see , predators usually appear at sunset .
and why is that ...?
it's when their prey come out to drink .
too strong for you?
i can learn to like it .
if i had the time .
how much time have you got?
until dawn , what about you?
oh , i'm just here for the birds .
ornithologist .
ah , ornithologist , eh?
wow , now there's a mouthful .
so you will be busy tonight with the owls , then huh?
no owls in los rganos .
nothing to see till the morning .
not out there , anyway .
so what do predators do , when the sun goes down?
they feast .
like there's no tomorrow .
are you always this frisky?
i've been missing the touch of a good woman .
who says i'm good?
what the hell do you want?
i don't need a goddamned wheel chair .
no?
you do now .
buenos diaz .
hola .
okay .
buenos diaz .
hola .
so you are to have dna replacement therapy .
let me explain the two phases .
first we kill off your bone marrow .
wipe the dna slate clean .
phase two , introduction of new dna , harvested from healthy donors .
orphans , runaways , people that won't be missed .
i like to think of myself as an artist .
and this is when i create .
thank you .
it is a painful process , i'm afraid .
but all great art is .
i'll certainly enjoy working on you .
of course , you know , most artists are only truly appreciated after they're dead .
my name is thomas schiller .
i'd like to open an account .
i live in hamburg .
my parents died when i was 7 .
caught your attention .
who is bankrolling your makeover , zao?
same person who set me up in north korea , eh?
james .
what's going on?
jinx , you gotta get out of here now !
move !
you see , my friend .
the chemical composition shows this is from sierra leone .
conflict diamonds .
there's some kind of marking here .
gg .
let me see .
oh yes .
from the graves corporation in iceland .
that's his laser signature .
a man called gustav graves , discovered diamonds there a year or so ago .
yet they are identical to conflict diamonds .
what an amazing coincidence .
how can he escape from a british warship ... right in the middle of hong kong harbor , right under your nose?
interesting station , moneypenny?
all i got was a storm warning .
you were supposed to throw away the key , not leave the door wide open .
are you implying i had a hand in his escape , mr. falco?
well , bond got away real fast , didn't he?
it is what he's trained to do .
your boy's been very busy in his training .
he shows up in cuba and torches a clinic ...
listen , put your house in order , or we're gonna do it for you .
your drink , sir .
lucky i asked for it shaken .
looks like your man's not gonna make it .
actually , he's right on time .
what a wonderful day to become a knight .
will you be using your title , mr. graves?
oh , you know me , i'm proud of my adopted nation , but i'd never stand on ceremony .
after an entrance like that you can't be surprised ... you're being called a self publicizing adrenaline junkie , can you?
i'd prefer the term " adventurer " .
we've been hearing rumors about the icarus space program .
what's the big secret?
it's not a secret , it's a surprise .
but don't worry , you'll soon be enlightened .
you seem to work 24/ 7 .
is it true that you don't need sleep?
you only get one shot at life .
why waste it on sleep?
aren't you trying out for a place in the british olympic fencing team?
we hear you have been training furiously .
i never get furious .
as they say in fencing , " what's the point " .
okay everybody , thank you very much .
i'm sure you understand ... we don't want to keep her majesty waiting any longer .
verity?
james bond .
your lesson .
i see you handle your weapon well .
i have been known to keep my tip up .
do you mind?
i think i've come undone .
why not?
feast your eyes on the finest plate in the club .
gustav graves?
no , his publicist , miranda frost .
my protg .
gorgeous , isn't she?
she took the gold in sydney .
by default as i remember?
default?
the one who beat her o. d. 'd on steroids .
miranda deserved that gold .
and now she's teaching graves how to win one .
he only plays for cash .
he's won so much , nobody else wants to fight him .
you want to meet him?
absolutely .
lead on .
gustav .
verity .
and mr.?
bond .
james bond .
have we met before?
oh , i think i'd remember .
of course you would .
my mistake .
are you a gambling man , mr. bond?
if the stakes are right .
a thousand a point too much for you?
care to place a bet , verity?
no thanks .
i don't like cock fights .
shall we?
excuse me .
best of three hits?
positions .
ready?
play .
en garde .
hit .
positions .
play .
hit .
two nil .
do you want to continue?
do you want to up the wager?
how much can you afford?
let's play for this .
i picked it up in cuba .
i believe it's one of yours .
my , my ... you do get around .
but then , diamonds are for everyone .
brilliant specimen .
completely flawless .
and chemically identical to african conflict diamonds .
the you are about to lose something very precious .
positions .
ready?
play .
en garde .
oh dear !
you want to continue?
of course i want to bloody continue !
but since we're upping the wager , let's up the weapon , shall we?
let's do this the old fashioned way .
first blood drawn from the torso .
that is enough !
it's just a little sport , miranda .
seems you beat me , mr. bond .
settle downstairs , shall we?
miranda .
you are a rare challenge , mr. bond .
lool , i'm putting up a little scientific demonstration in iceland at the weekend .
icarus?
perhaps you could join us?
miranda , make the arrangements , would you?
once i've smoothed things over with the club .
what would i do without you?
can i expect the pleasure of you in iceland?
i'm afraid you'll never have that pleasure , mr. bond .
excuse me , commander bond .
someone left this for you .
the place needed redecorating anyway .
i heard of this place .
never thought i'd find myself here .
some things are best kept underground .
an abandoned station for abandoned agents .
your calling card .
so what have you got on graves?
you burn me , and now you want my help .
what did you expect , an apology?
oh i know , you'll do whatever it takes to get the job done .
just like you .
the difference is , i don't compromise .
well , i don't have the luxury of seeing things as black and white .
while you were away , the world changed .
not for me .
you are suspicious of graves , or i wouldn't be here right now .
so , what do you have?
nothing , beyond the official biography .
orphan , working in an argentinean diamond mine , learns engineering , makes a huge find in iceland and gives half of it to charity .
from nothing to everything in no time at all .
and his demonstration this weekend?
probably just another publicity stunt .
now , tell me what you know about this cuban clinic .
gene therapy , new identities courtesy of dna transplants .
so called beauty parlor .
we heard rumors of such a place .
i didn't think it really existed .
it doesn't anymore .
zao got away , but he left these behind .
all from gustav graves 'mine .
i think it's a front for laundring african conflict diamonds .
we need to tread carefully .
graves is politically connected .
lucky i'm on the outside then .
well , it seems you have become useful again .
then maybe it's time you let me get on with my job .
i don't know if i've mentioned it , 007 ... but a perfect marksman isn't really supposed to shoot his own boss .
check the replay .
you'll find he's dead and she has only got a flesh wound .
there's always the excuse isn't there , 00 zero?
give me the old firing range any day , quartermaster .
yes but it's called " the future " , so get used to it .
so , this is where they keep the old relics then , eh?
i'll have you know this is where our most cutting edge technology is developed .
hmm , point taken .
must you touch everything?
does this still work?
now look ...
so where is this cutting edge stuff?
i'm trying to get to it .
weapon , please .
one pane unbreakable glass , ... one standard issue ring finger .
twist so ...
voil !
ultra high frequency single digit solid agitator unit .
you know , you're cleverer that you look .
still , better than looking cleverer than you are ... follow me please .
now , new watch .. your twentieth i believe .
how time flies .
yes , 007 why don't you establish a record by actually returning this one .
you new transportation .
maybe you've been down here too long .
the ultimate in british engineering .
you must be joking !
as i learned from my predecessor bond , i never joke about my work .
aston marlin call it the vanquish .
we call it the vanish .
oh , very good .
adopted camouflage .
tiny cameras on all sides ... project the image they see onto a light emitting ... polymer skin on the opposite side .
you see?
for the casual eye it's as good as invisible .
plus all the usual refinements , ejector seat , torpedoes , target seeking shotguns to shoot down mobile objects .
why don't you acquaint yourself with the manuals .
you ought to shoot through that in a couple of hours .
just took a few seconds , q.
wish i could make you vanish .
come in .
before you leave on your mission to iceland , ... tell me what you know of james bond .
he is a 00 , and a wild one as i discovered today .
he'll light the fuse on any explosive situation ... and be a danger to himself and others .
kill first , ask questions later .
i think he's a blunt instument .
his primary method is to provoke and confront .
a man nobody can get close to .
a womanizer .
well , you'll be seeing a lot more of him in iceland .
with great respect , a man like him could blow my cover .
miss frost , you volunteered for this operation ... but in three months you've turned up next to nothing .
graves seems to be clean .
well , bond thinks differently , so i'll let him do what you so ably described .
mix things up a little with mr. graves .
and with you there , things won't get out of hand .
in your three years in cryptology you've managed to keep business and pleasure separate .
you haven't fraternized with any of your fellow agents .
despite several advances .
i think it would be foolish to get involved with someone in the community .
especially james bond .
