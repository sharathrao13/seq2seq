they ain't gonna give us nothing .
not no 40 acres and no mule .
and not freedom , neither .
it's like a poison soaked into the ground .
the time is going .
i don't wanna spend my life washing other people's clothes .
i wanna live somewhere with you , like natural people .
i wanna have your children and raise them someplace ... ... where there ain't even a shadow of slavery .
i think about sewing , making pretty things for my family ... ... while my hands are still steady .
i wanna go someplace with you .
i wanna have your children .
but i won't have them here .
i am going somewhere .
they won't have us in canada ... ... l'll go to the edge of the ocean , and i'll walks on away from here .

you're just tired .
when it's dark , looks like the heart just gets to hurting sometimes .
you gonna keep on fighting best way you can .
looks like there just ain't no other way .
i love you , buck .
where'd you get them cannons?
gunsmith in fort leavenworth .
where'd you get that funny bible?
well , that my inheritance .
before the war , when i was a boy ... ... my mama and me was sold to a travelling preacher .
i'd fetch for him and take up collection .
and when he got drunk , i'd haul him off to bed .
he travelled in little towns , preaching sin and hellfire .
when he got them gals full of the holy spirit ... ... when they're ready to repent , he'd jerk them .
between wiles ... ... he'd take my mama to bed .
and i'd sleep out with the horse .
by and by , about 16 , he sent me to town for a jug of whiskey .
when i come back , my mama was gone .
he sold her for a couple hundred dollars .
boy , put me to bed .
so i lead that man into the tanning yard by the lime pit .
and i put him to bed right there .
i hold him under with a cedar fence rail .
there was no next of kin .
so i got the cart , the horse ...
preacher clothes and this funny bible .
where are you gonna find that money?
i don't know .
if it was me , i'd look for money where money's kept .
like in a bank or an express office .
we gonna walk in the bank and just take it?
that's right , brother .
and i know just the place .
where they ain't got no sheriff , no deputy and hardly any men ... ... because they out in the countryside chasing two poor field hands .
you're crazy .
yeah .
what you want , boy?
you make a sound , and you're a dead man .
we ain't got all day .

i sent the cash deposit over to the bank .
will you get off that? !
that's a whole mess of gold .
you can't carry it on a horse .
where's the key?
there's got to be a key !
it's in texas .
they always send the key separate .
he's telling the truth , but there's got to be paper money .
i'm gonna ask you for the last time .
where is that paper money?
i told you .

i sent it over there .

let's get out of here .
preacher .
i'm going to that bank .
it's across from the sheriff's office !
there's an awful lot of money down there .
otherwise , we done wasted the whole morning .
you're the one that's crazy .
morning , miss esther .
how you feeling?
some better , thanks .
thing like that's not easy to forget , but life goes on .
my money good enough for you?
money's money .
hard earned too .
wages of sin , just so's i get 3 percent on them .
i got stuck with ohio bank notes .
are they any good?
that depends on the solvency of that particular ...
hold up !
hold up !
they're gonna get away !
yeah .
you shoot that rifle , boy , and we're dead !
you gonna quit?
remember that wagon train you shot up?
yeah .
they never did come back .
i wonder if they're joining up with them .
he say he will not fight them for you .
i understand .
tell him i just need help to get through to my people .
they need supplies , and i can pay .
dried meat , as much as he can sell them .
horses , powder and shot .
five horses .
no powder .
no guns .
ask him again .
tell him we're all brothers .
he will not give you guns .
they come too hard .
food .
dried meat .
flour .
corn .
do not ask for more .
he stopped that posse because he gave his word to let you through safe .
he will do no more .
ask him again .
tell him they looking for their own land , and they'll have to fight for it ... ... because they can't live back there , no way .
before the yellow hair , my father , my grandfather hunted buffalo ... ... raised pony and took women on the land ... ... where fox river crosses the grassland at place of skull .
now copper spring , fort sheridan .
now we are here with our backs against snow mountain .
and yellow hair send wagon , soldier and speaking wire .
tomorrow we will be like ghosts .
like the spirits that come in dreams with no earth to walk on .
but we will fight .
we will fight ten tens of years , and our children's children will fight .
we need our guns , bullets and powder for our own fight .
tell him his enemies are our enemies .
he say you black people fought with that enemy against our people .
i ain't in the army no more .
he knows , buck .
no guns .
no bullets .
eighteen hundred dollars .
that's your share .
for what we have just received , we give thanks .
in jesus 'name , amen .
i'm going back east to illinois , and i'm gonna buy me a tent .
i'm gonna have the biggest revival meeting since king solomon ... ... preached to his wives and concubines .
amen .
and you , brother , you got a good woman there .
take that money and buy yourself a living and do like she want .
go to canada .
all right , brother .
one question .
how do i get out of here?
to illinois?
one of two ways .
go on back the way we come and on across kansas .
there's a posse with a trigger hitch .
yes , there is .
what's the other way?
keep on west , across the pecos to where i'm going .
into the mountains and north along the idaho territory ... ... then back by the canadian border .
how long that take?
all winter .
all winter .
what's my chances of sneaking past the posse?
not much .
when i caught you eating my rabbit ... ... i should've got me a rock , busted you upside your head and left you for dead .
scout come in .
that posse did not go back .
they're tracking the wagon train .
how close are they to it?
one day ride from the big river .
how long will it take us to catch them , riding straight through?
maybe two days .
he will give you guides to take you through the high pass .
remember , they will not fight for you .
i know .
looks like the back door's open .
figure i can skate on through and take my chances .
you done walked more than half the journey with the st. ann parish folk .
that's all a normal man can do .
what do you wanna die for them for?
what happened?
somebody close the back door?
if they're gonna join up with them , they'll do it before sundown .
let's finish off that wagon train .
they ain't broke any laws i know about .
we gotta turn them around .
what you got against them folks?
you on their side?
you soft in the head for them?
they killed uncle beau , robbed the bank .
they didn't !
buck and that preacher did .
and that's all we're after .
you don't understand .
i gotta turn them field hands around .
if we leave them fields go fallow now , we done lost it all .
we gotta keep it going like it was , the way they rightfully belong .
you got 16 white men down there .
sixteen .
you just give me half of them , and i'll finish that job .
as far as i'm concerned , that wagon train can go anywhere it likes !
and you make one move against those people ... ... i'll take you to copper springs with you tied under the belly of your horse .
where's ollie?
he went to cover the pass .
he'll say , " boo , " if that buck comes through .
what does he want us to do?
take the wagon train .
well , if that's what he said ...
let's go !
you gonna have to take it to them .
what you gonna do?
we can draw them south .
but ...
you go with the wagon train .
i'll come to you later .
get up on top .
go around in front of them and cut them off !
i run out .
