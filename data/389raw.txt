the thlrd wave
the hague , hoiland
europol the european union's police authority
on the internationai scene , iike his compatriots before him
dag hammarskid , raoui wailenberg , olof palme
men who are aii symbols for strength , justice and integrity .
so it is my honour to introduce
the new head of the organized crime unit
superintendent seilberg of the gothenburg police .
thanks .
i've been a policeman aii my iife , working close to the street .
hopefuily that's why i got the job .
so i'm painfuily aware that the new criminality , which is crossing
the borders , and destroying the fabric of society throughout europe
iies under the surface .
thus , the papers seldom write about it .
and what we don't read in the papers ... doesn't exist , right?
what i am about to say has never been stated by a police authority .
i'm tired of being politicaily correct .
it's too iate for that now .
the type of crime i speak of has hit european countries
in three different waves .
the first arrived over the iast decade , the second a bit iater , at
different times in different countries .
and the third wave ... is here now .
contrary to popular belief it's not drugs
which turn over most dirty money .
drug dealing is risky .
and results in iong prison sentences .
smuggling people , however , results in short prison sentences .
so a huge industry can be built , employing many people
as the risks are so iow .
recently europoi exposed a transport company with over a thousand iorries
engaged in different forms of smuggling .
a thousand iorries , in just one company !
alcohoi and cigarette smuggling , trading in people
organized prostitution , eu related vat frauds , fiddling with subsidies .
organized crime is no doubt the iargest industry in europe .
its turnover is over a thousand biilions euros every year .
five times switzerland's gnp !
dealing with this kind of money , it's important that nothing goes wrong .
unfortunately these organized criminals coilaborate better
than both the police and governments
and they are more ruthless than their counterparts in north america .
they are not afraid of executing politicians , judges , prosecutors
women and children .
and where do aii these thousands of biilions euros go?
they are re invested .
today miilions of companies
are owned or controiled by organized crime .
today anybody ...
you , for instance ... ... can go on the internet and with an ordinary credit card buy a shady bank
in a tax haven .
neither the police or tax authorities wiii be informed .
there are islands with more banks than p. o. boxes .
than inhabitants .
but it's not only in tax havens that criminals own banks .
we know today that severai of europe's oldest banks
are secretly owned by criminals .
the total figure is incredible .
we suspect that today more than 50 percent of aii banks and financial
institutions in europe are owned or controiled by organized crime .
a few years ago this figure applied to eastern europe .
now the figure there is over 85 per cent .
i'm talking about europe today .
and the figure is increasing iike an avalanche .
an entire continent is being stolen .
europoi is the only police authority in europe that has
the war against organized crime as its first and foremost priority .
this is a war we intend to win .
it's a war we must win .
thanks .
london's flnanclal dlstrlct
the man of the hour .
how did i do?
you reaily dropped the bomb .
you think they got it?
the reporters?
yes .
they took you very seriously .
now we just have to deliver .
after september 11 , budget problems disappeared , hire whomever you iike .
dunkerque , the french west coast
remember , the police are there for the state and the public interest .
not for the individual .
thank you .
are you iistening?
yes .
no , you aren't .
yes , i am .
if i have a problem , or you , the police won't solve it if
the solution goes against the state , but you won't find that in any books .
i'm talking to you !
please , we're on holiday .
no , you're free from schooi to foilow your mom on her job .
and i've promised to help you with " today's police and judiciary system " .
nothing you say is in the books .
so it won't be on the test .
exactly !
then why iearn it?
because the trick is to know , what other people think they know
but also know how things reaily are .
understand?
shit ...

how did it go?
new clients in italy , germany , spain .
so it went weil?

did you hear about seilberg?
yes .
it's horrible !
can you speak?
yes , why?
this could be dangerous , but i trust you , anja .
what is it?
promise , you won't tell anyone .
it depends on what it is .
some people disappeared from the scene of the murder in the hague .
two kiilers and ... ... two others .
i need to know if europol , or any other police authority
knows who they were .
check with cld in stockholm .
heil , johan , was it ...

l've sald nothing so far .
i'm afraid that if the killers learn his identity
they might go after his family .
you get it?
yes , caii me back in a few minutes .
thanks .
bye .
according to the cld the dutch police have only identified one person .
a hit man , dressed as a cop , was kiiled in the restaurant .
a frenchman , jean monteux .
two other hit men , and a woman
and another man , have not been ldentifled , but are wanted .
kane's iawyers .
i can't help anymore without informing my coileagues .
just a minute , some iawyers are walking in to europol .
i'ii give you their names .
i need to know what they're after .
if we go to the police there's a risk that aii that we say
wiii end up with the kiilers 'iawyers who are at europoi right now .
they know who you are , but to get to you , they need to know who i am
and put pressure on me , perhaps by threatening you .
lawyers?
how do you know aii this?
anja .
so you've talked to the police?
anja's a friend .
she won't talk .
she did to you ...
i'ii get the kiilers .
it's to our advantage that they don't know who i am .
johan , why did i push you into this?
weil , i just can't give up , can i?
that's what you've done for a year .
she'ii die if nobody helps her .
but you're using her and your ex girlfriend at police hq
for revenge !
i don't want you to , johan !
i'm pregnant .

kane has ieft the hospital .

europoi exposed the company , seized the iorries , the owner got six years .
no , he was only a ... what do you caii it ... a front ...
i mean the reai owners , who bought the iorries back at auction .
through a new front , for iess money than the debts from the first one .
and now they're roiling again .
i've seen three pass here now .
ok , is kane one of the owners?
no , he arranges the transactions .
he gets the dirty money into iegitimate companies
on the stock exchange in london , and in new york .
how?
correspondent banking .
he's got 12 , maybe 13 , bank managers he works with , in as many countries
so the authorities don't see any connection .
and tomorrow ... he'ii be in munich .
how do you know that?
he's just ieft the hospital .
if he doesn't turn up , some people wiii get very angry .
who?
i was to have dinner with some guys iast night .
nice businessmen ...
one owns " cuisine express " , the chain of restaurants in half of europe .
another owns one of the iargest chain store companies
and then there's the guy , who is the reai owner of the iorries .
weil , that's that ...
we'ii ieave the rentai car here .
and then what?
leave the hague .
the airports and railroad stations aren't safe .
you shouldn't travei by car in your condition .

how iong have you known him?
since i was nineteen .
london school of economics .
i was in the first year , he was in the iast .

you must come right away .
don't trust them .
they belong to kane .
62 meters , dead calm .
i know this security fiirm .
it's one of the best in europe .
but it's owned by harrows capital , which is owned by a trust in jersey
an invisible trust controiled by kane .
so these are his iackeys , his samurai .
they're probably not aware of it .
you are vice president at his financiai institution , so you're a iackey , too .
cut it out !
what?
i checked my contracts from the fair , to see from whom i obtain orders .
there's a company connected to the chain stores she talked about .
so i've been supported , and you
by the same bastards who are mixed up with those iorries .
yeah , it's heil , but it's reality !
face it , she's been fucking brave .
wait .
