after that ... poor old abner couldn't afford to keep the place ... or me , either , for that matter .

that guy , for instance .
hey , maggie .
take a look at your new home .

let's go .
that's right .
what do you say , caloway?
bah !

i will not abandon pearl in her hour of need ... for such a ridiculous plan .

as far as i'm concerned , that's not an option .
all right .
suit yourself .
come on , grace .
we've got a farm to save .
oh , you'll have to excuse her .
she's just a little tense .
tense .
what's her specialty , sour cream?
going to town .
of all the ill conceived i ...
now , don't look at me so crossly .
i know what you're going to say ... that maggie and grace will need someone ... with my eye for detail ... to keep them on the straight and narrow .
say no more .
i'll go .
now , tut tut .
no mushy good byes , my little ones .
you know how i get about overly emotional displays .
ahem .

good luck , girls !

she'll be " comin ''round the mountain she'll be comin ''round the mountain she'll be comin ''round ...
she better hurry up around that mountain ...
'cause i cannot take this much longer .
maggie , may i be frank?
only if you let me wear the hat .
ahem .
lowbrow remarks may work for you ... but we prefer the gentle approach .
well , she better stick a sock in it soon .
the vultures are starting to circle .
hey , she's not dying !
you sure?
we could wait around !
... no , nothing , when she sees grandma no more food for her
we'll keep you posted !
false alarm , clem !
roger dodger , out like the wind !
hey , maggie , mrs. c?

there's no fences .
what keeps the people from roaming?
they appear to be domesticated .
it doesn't feel dangerous at all .
it's perfectly safe .
quiet as a farm at milkin 'time .
what was that?
it's a gunfight !
aah !
hit the dirt !
who lives like this?

if that's the sheriff's office , this town rocks .
well , if it isn't three maids a milkin '.
you girls a little far from home , aren't ya?
well , if it isn't the phony express .
we want a word with you about this .
what's that?

the place went bankrupt .
your farm is history .

ah ah ah .
you got three days to pay or get on your way .
and sixty bucks don't cut it .
looks like you need about ...
hmm , i'd say ...
seven hundred and fifty of 'em .
but , maggie , where are we gonna get all that money?
well , maybe maggie can just pull it out of her ear .
hey , watch it , caloway .
rico .
rico .
rico .
rico .
who is that?
shh .
sorry .
don't you know a hero when you see one , huh?
that's rico ... the best dang bounty hunter this side of the pecos .
i could guess from here to tomorrow ... but i don't know how you do it , rico .
mmf !
where's my money?
well , all right , i got it right here for you .
hey , they're giving away free money !
oh !
maggie !
so , who else is out there?
the only varmint left ... is that low down , good for nothin 'alameda slim .
cattle rustler .
what's the bounty? $750 .
i got it !
why don't we go nab that alameda slim ... and use the reward money to save the farm?
oh , that is a sensible idea .
i knew you'd love it !
tch .
don't they have sarcasm where you come from?
oh , wake up and smell the alfalfa !
it's perfect !
i'm gonna need a fresh horse .
hmm , a horse .
a horse .
let me think .
i reckon you'd want a fast horse , huh?
real fast?
course , he'd also have to be able to go ... for days without food or drink ... stealthy , sure footed in any terrain ... well , huh ...
look at me !
what about that horse?
what , you mean buck here?
eee !
boy , i don't know .
buck's fast , all right , but he's kind of a handful .
he'll do .
well , suit yourself .
hey , rusty !
rico's saddle !
i'm wearing rico's saddle !
i'm wearing rico's saddle !
great .
i'll leave you two alone .
ohh , oh , no .
no , no , no .
there is no way in heaven or earth ... that cows can catch an outlaw .
look , all we've got to do ... is follow this chuck wagon to a cattle drive .
ahh .
and then , you see ... we let the bad guys come to us .
oh !
we've no reason to believe ... this chuck wagon is heading off to a cattle drive .
hey , tommy !
have fun on that cattle drive !
all right , then .
mm hmm .
i think it is headed toward a cattle drive .
shh .
we are not following this wagon , and that is final .
come on , caloway .
it'll be fun !
did you just hit me?
kinda .
well , stop it .
why?
because i don't like it .
ooh !
oh , no .
not the hat .

why don't we all take a deep cleansing breath ...
yaah !
yaah !
hey , now !
mud wrestling !
ha ha !

adios , buck .

hasta la vista , heifers !
hoo hoo !
oh , give me a home where the buffalo roam and the deer ... ahem ... and the antelope pla a ay where seldom is heard a discouraging word and the skies are not cloudy all day
home , home on the range

oh , hello .
let me guess .
you're a taurus .
look , just keep moving and avoid eye contact .
ahem .
oh !
pardon me , but what are three lovely ladies like you ... doing on a drive like this?
just ignore them , and perhaps they'll go away .
oh , they seem like nice guys .
maybe they can help us .
why , sure we can help you .
maybe we can help each other .
hmm?
hmm?
look , lover bull , we're here strictly on business .
ooh , sounds pretty exciting .

we're looking for a cattle rustler named alameda slim .
grace !
shh !
grace !
shh !
hey , it doesn't hurt to ask .
slim?
oh ho ho ho !
why , slim's just a scary bedtime story ... to get little calves to behave .
uhh !
ooh !
what was that?
it must be slim and the willies .
slim and the willies?
don't worry , darlin '.
i'll protect you .
you have exactly two seconds to remove your hoof ... before i snap it off at the knee .
oh , uh , sorry , ma'am .

hmm ...
rico , if you'd just been a second earlier ... you'd have had that rustler dead to rights .
you boys see anything before i got here?
yeah , we sure did there , rico .
we were just settin 'down to supper ... when all of a sudden the lights went out .
all right , what part of " cover me " didn't we understand?
you guys ok?
i don't know .
i feel like i was dreaming .
yeah .
slim started singing ... and all of a sudden i lost track of everything .
singing?
that didn't sound like singing to me .
and , you know , i have perfect pitch .
uh , yes .
grace , about your perfect pitch ...
not now , maggie .
all right , show's over !
oh , no .
you're interfering with official police bidness !
ha .
be right with you , big guy .
buck is on the case .
you know .
whoo !
don't embarrass me in front of my partner .
please !
you and he are partners?
so , how does that work exactly?
i mean , do you get to ride him on odd days or even?
hey !
he chose me specifically ... because i have skills that are essential ... to capturing our quarry .
huh?
ha ha ha !
whoo !
smush !
oof !
you boys headed back to town?
yes , sir .
we got to go file a report with the sheriff .
give him back his horse .
this one's too skittish around cows .
and that , girls , is what makes me and rico ... equal parts of one lean mean crime fighting ...
machine?
well , there it is , then .
well , well , well , stud .
now , i'm no professional ... but i'd say the only mano a mano you'll be doing ... is in your dreams .
oh , look out , buck .
he's making a move on your left flank .
kaboosh !
maggie !
grace !
leave that poor animal alone .
buck , i realize you're very upset ... but if you'd like to join our group ... and help us bring in slim , we'd be happy to have you .
however , there are a few ... anger management issues we need to discuss .
i wouldn't help you bossy bovines ... if my life depended on it !
you see , that's just what i'm talking about .
grace !
bye .
come on , girls .
hmm .
let's go get slim .
come on , girls , let's go get slim .
cud chewing heifers .
huh .
i can catch that slim with one hoof tied behind my back .
wait a minute .
why don't i?
yes !
partner or no partner , that's what i'm a do .
hey !
hold the horse now .
aw , forget it .
definitely bipolar .
move it , sister !
hero passing on the left !
hey , watch it .
where are you going , hotfoot?
i'm gonna go nab that rustler ... and show rico i got what it takes ... so say good bye to your farm , girls , because slim is mine .
it's hero time !
watch out now !
hey !
get back !
jump back !
kiss myself !
whoo !
da da yoo
oh , this is a fine kettle of fish .
how can we compete with that?
look at the bright side , mrs. c.
don't forget about our secret weapon .
secret weapon?
who better to catch a cattle thief than a cow?
yeah , even you can't argue with that kind of logic .
ok , maybe you can .
you know , grace ...
maggie does so love your singing .
how about a song?
i'm gonna get you for this .
ha ha !
5, 000 texas longhorns .
not bad for one night's work .
pick a color .
i said , not bad for one night's work .
what?
thank you .
and judging by the ear mark ...
i'd say these are the last of big mike donald's herd .
big mike donald had a farm?
e l e i ...
e l e i ...
ohh ...
ohh ...
that's right .
he had a farm .
heh heh heh .
now that all his cash cows have disappeared ... that poor sap's gonna be flat broke .
perfect time for a certain upstanding land owner ... to step in and take all the land .
aah !
who are you?
what did you do with uncle slim?
put up your dukes , mr. fancy britches .
aah aah aah aah aah aah !
it's me .
hello?
this here is the disguise i use ... to sneak into all them auctions ... and buy all the land , you brainless monotone monkeys .
shoot , you got to be the richest land baron in the west .
yes , but the part that really warms my heart ... is watching those homesteaders suffer .
back in the day , i worked ... the highfalutinest ranches you ever seen ... but those stuck up ranch bosses couldn't appreciate my talents .
maybe they just didn't like your singing .
my singing?
songbirds sing .
saloon gals sing .
little bitty snot nosed children sing .
i yodel !
and yodeling is an art !
well , maybe they just didn't like your yodeling .
he didn't mean it , uncle slim .
everybody likes yodeling .
hmm?
why , it's one of the funniest , cornball , goofy , silly sounds ... in the whole west .
yaah !
aah !
yaah !
uh , gil?
uh huh?
am i correct in assuming that each and every time ... we brought a herd back to this secret lair ... you've managed to sit in the exact same spot ... blocking that choice piece of property from my view? !
this is my comfy place .
what?
aah !
it's called patch of heaven , uncle slim .
goes on auction thursday morning .
perfect .
pencil it in .
thursday morning ... right after we sell off this herd .
but it's just a little old dirt farm .
ah , what's the difference?
when you're talking revenge , every last acre counts .
i don't get it .
weren't the cows supposed to come back?
daddy , what's going to happen if they don't come back?
oh , but they are coming back .
hogwash !
we all know they're never coming back .
what?
ooh !
ooh !
you don't know that , jeb .
everybody knows that bovines ... are the most intelligent , crafty animals in the west .
yeah .
he's right , you know .
it doesn't take a cow to figure out ... they saw the writing on the wall ... and flown the coop while the getting was good .
what?
oh , no !
they tricked us and deserted us !
no , no .
aud audrey .
excuse me .
excuse me .
excuse me !
oh , uh , let's not forget who we're talkin ''bout .
audrey , remember when grace helped you figure out ... why you crossed the road?
and , jeb , miss caloway knew just what to do ... when your head got stuck in that spittoon .
get off my case !
and maggie was gonna make us all winners .
i truly believe there ain't nothin '... those three cows can't do .
aw ...
well , whatever they're gonna do , they better do it soon .
i'm so very sorry , pearl .
it's a real shame .
it is .
ollie , i don't know what's worse ...
losing my farm to the highest bidder ... or knowing that ... that my girls are lost and alone out there .
yee haw !
come on , girls .
either i'm getting good at this ... or his scent is getting stronger .
go get him , maggie .
look out , slim !
no .
it can't be .
we're on your trail !
hmm .
hoo hoo !
oops .
this has buck written all over it .
we're not gonna let this dumb old trick stop us .
sooner or later , all these paths will hook up , and then ...
oh , no , the tracks !
hurry up , girls .
don't lose that trail .
what trail?
i can't see anything .
look out !
oh !
flash flood !
get to high ground !
oh .
maggie !
oh !
maggie !
no !
come on , girls , we can't give up !
maggie , that's enough .
the minute this lets up ... we're heading straight home to patch of heaven .
but what about catching slim and collecting the reward?
we never had a prayer ... of catching slim in the first place .
this whole ridiculous plan ... is just so you can get revenge on those cattle rustlers .
hey !
for your information , duchess ... this whole ridiculous plan is about us saving our farm .
huh .
our farm might've had a fighting chance ... until you came along .
what's that supposed to mean?
strutting around with your vulgar show cow behavior .
look , i was just having ... wasting our time on your foolish plans .
through the years , patch of heaven ... has survived every hardship that nature can dish out ... but you , maggie ... are the biggest catastrophe to ever hit our farm .
well , if that's the way you feel about it ... maybe we should just go our separate ways .
now , that's the first good idea you've ever had .
fine !
fine !
fine !
fine !
yeah .
fine .
it's not like your farm ... was ever gonna feel like home to me anyways .
rain is pourin 'down like the heavens are hurtin 'seems like it's been dark since the devil knows when how do you go on never knowing for certain will the sun ever shine again?
feels like it's been years since it started to thunder clouds are campin 'out in the valley and glen how do you go on when you can't help but wonder will the sun ever shine again?
what if the rain keeps fallin '?
what if the sky stays gray?
what if the winds keep squallin 'and never go away?
maybe soon the storm will be tired of blowin 'maybe soon it all will be over , amen how do you go on if there's no way of knowin '?
will the sun ever shine?
wish i could say
send me a sign one little ray lord , if you're listenin 'how long until then?
will the sun ever shine again?
mmm ...
mmm ...
maggie .
maggie .
maggie .
wake up .
check , please !
it tasted a lot better in my sleep .
well , i suppose you'll be off now .
mm hmm .
where will you go?
oh , probably check out the grand canyon .
see utah before i die .
wait a minute .
where's grace?
hi , there .
boy , am i glad you guys are up .
hey , come look at this .
what on earth?
where did all this come from?
hey , it's green , it's leafy , and it's free .
shut up and eat .
good morning , ladies .
i see you're already tucked into your appetizer .
never knew a pretty lady that didn't have an appetite .
oh , now , see here , you ruffian ...
he's not a ruffian , mrs. caloway .
he's a genuine desert shaman ... our very own wise man .
shaman , chef , chief cook , and bottle washer .
i'm a jackrabbit of all trades and at your service .
folks around these parts call me lucky jack .
yep , they used to come from miles around ... just to get one rub of my lucky rabbit's foot .
whoo !
dagnabit !
this happens all the time .
now , where was i?
ah .
voila .
now let me just get this on the fire ... and it'll be ready directly .
mm huh .
ow !
yow !
look , we don't eat meat .
it's kind of like a professional courtesy .
perhaps we'll dine with you some other time .
you see , grace and i are returning to our farm ... to say our last good byes .
yeah .
we need closure .
well , i can sympathize there , sister , i truly can .
until recently , i , too , had a home .
echo mine it was called .
us jackrabbits lived there for generation after generation .
till some land grabbing bandit moved in ... and flushed us out like yesterday's oatmeal .
ahem .
excuse us .
my good fellow , we must be on our way .
wait !
there he is !
aah !
slim !
you mean this no good varmint ... is hiding out in echo mine right now?
without a doubt .
maggie , what are you thinking?
look , i got a score to settle with that rhinestone fat boy ... and nothing to lose .
but it'll be dangerous going after slim all by yourself .
hey , i got the rabbit .
that's not all you got , maggie .
you got us .
oh , no .
no , no , no .
no .
we are sticking to our plan and going home .
hold on , you two .
as strange as this sounds , grace is actually making sense .
thank you .
you want the money ... and i want to get even with slim .
the three of us go together , and we're sure to get him .
once you collect the reward , i'll walk out your front gate ... and i'll stay out of it forever .
deal?
your powers of persuasion are uncanny .
deal .
ha !

ahem .
mr. weaseley , my money , if you please .
heh heh heh .
i was just keeping it safe for you , slim .

protecting my investments is what i pay this fellow for .
mr. weaseley , let me present ... the most traitorous , double crossin 'gun for hire ... that i've ever had the pleasure to call partner ...
rico .
you're too kind , boss .
no , it can't be .
his reputation as a bounty hunter is well known ... but lately he's been doing a little moonlighting ... and covering my tracks .
rico's going to see you to the border ... so that nothing else goes wrong .
tck tck .
now , if you'll all pardon me ... there's a little patch of heaven ... on the auction block this morning .
he's going to buy our farm !
adios !
yee haw !
i don't know how you got here , skittish ... but stick with me , and you may get to like ... the other side of the law .

whoa !

now , that's entirely possible !
yo !
or maybe i just figured out who the real heroes are !
wait !
what if this is some kind of trick?
whoo !
whassah !
oh , this isn't a trick !
it's a miracle !
come on !
so you think you got the drop on me ... well , think again !
hyah !

alameda slim has already flown the coop .

unless we sprout wings , we'll never make it back in time .
i can't believe what i'm hearing .
this train goes right by patch of heaven .
what is in the cud you've been chewin '?
how are we supposed to drive that thing?
how?
how?
i'll tell you how !
the same way we walked off the farm into the unknown .
the same way we fought off those burly barmaids .
and the same way we braved the western wilderness ... without the benefit of food or water .
we caught slim once , and we shall do it again !
who's with me?
get out of here , you bulls !
head for the hills !
whoo !
unh !
