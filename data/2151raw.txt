let me tell you a story .
a fairy tale .
kinda .
about a bunch of tooth fairies who lost their magic ... .. and the adventure we all had to get it back .
it all started last christmas , ... .. when i was about to break the world land speed record .
captain tom wallit is cleared and ready for takeoff .
i dedicated that historic moment to my mother and father ... .. and to the memory of my sister tolly , who had just recently been ... .. eaten by bears .
tommy?
tommy?
what are you doing?
keepin 'an eye on your sister?
yeah , mom .
so i lied about the bears .
but a boy can dream .
harsh .
card's declined .
really?
no problem , i'll just ...
i'll write out a cheque .
sorry .
can't do it .
you're the wall of shame , lady .
the wall of what?
the wall of shame .
happy holidays .
ohh , honey !
congratulations .
we'll take it home , put it under your pillow ... .. and tonight ... the tooth fairy will fly in .
tooth fairy?

shh .
oh , puh lease !
" i ate dirt with bigfoot " : a sceptical examiner exclusive .
yikes .
what's next , tooth fairies?
tooth in .
money out .
good morning , metro area !
put those snow shovels away , it's gonna be another warm one today .
probably our warmest holiday on record , ... .. but don't let that affect your holiday cheer .
i like pennies .
and half a jam sandwich .

dad must have done it .
it was the tooth fairy , stupe .
pygmy .
yo yo .
it wasn't your father .

because he didn't come home last night , that's how come .
dad !
can i help you?
you just do what you have to do .
and make it fast .
it's christmas .
next time i'll wish for some real money from the tooth fairy .
money makes the world go round .
and thanks to this little beauty , ... .. we'll make plenty of it .
right here in fairytopia .
money for a billion teeth a year .
money to buy the world's christmas presents .
money's all we need .
but what about magic?
who said that? !
magic is for suckers .
we haven't used magic since mrs c.
she's living up there now .
she's got magic .
care to find her?
be my guest .
but know this : .. others have tried , ... .. none have returned .
chhh !
fairy hunters .
anyway , who needs magic now?
we've moved on to things that are much more modern and exciting .

i'm gonna ask for some real money from the tooth fairy this time .
yeah .

maybe my mom and dad would have been better off in some other time ... .. and some other place .
as explorers , maybe .
once the world's greatest team , ... .. they got trapped inside the pharaoh's tomb , ... .. with no source of food but each other .

or the night before that .
you're just a loudmouth and a loser .
if i wasn't such a loser , i'd find mrs c and get magic back .

humans hunt our kind for sport .
there's a jungle of human wickedness between us and magic .
and you're no action hero !
geronimo !

what do we do now?
we change the future .
we're just kids .
and we can keep on makin 'mud pies and pickin 'our nose ... .. and playing with our food ... .. or we can change the world as we know it .

it's all right , everybody !
everything's under control .
well , you made it .
congratulations .
i thought the breaking down the door bit was excessive , but not to worry .
ok , where are we and who are you?
around the world they say that i'm ... .. the one and only king of rhyme .
it's me !
the voice of choice , the host with the most , the man ...
we get it .
so , erm , you want to see ...
mrs c.

heavenly acres home for retired magicians?
come on , come on , come on .
now , you have to be careful .
erm , ...
mrs c is in a terrible mood .
one of the residents ...
levitated her poodle .

oh ho ho ho ho ho ho !
oh ho ho ho ho ho ho !
santa !
oh ho ... oh ho ...
children , this magic sounds pretty powerful .
the world would have to be a pretty wonderful place to deserve it .
all i know is i got till sunset to make things right ... .. or the whole world's gonna hate me .
i don't wanna be hated .
oh , i see .
this is all about you , is it?
bit selfish , don't you think?
but ... that's not what i said .
sorry , dear , can't help you .
but ...
turn it down or i'll kick it in !
come on , tol .
look , lady , do you know what we've been through?
so you're having a bad day or you think the world's a drag !
just do something about it ... .. cos , if you sit there when you're needed most , you're the selfish one !
do you know who i am?
erm , everything all right?
how many of them do you have to hurt before you change your mind?
yeah , we were ... just leaving .
it's to make you happy .
merry christmas .

fbl , navy seals , the mafia , whatever it takes , ...
.. l'm getting my mom and dad back .
what?
tom !
wait , tom , ...
i wanna help .
forget it .
you don't care about them .
you're just scared people will hate you .
the only one you've cared about this whole time is you .
it's not true .
the money .
where is she? !
where's the fairy?
where is she?
put me down !
i would love to put you down .
now , tell me where your friend the fairy is .
come on !
oh , stop kicking .
little brat .
where is she?
where's the fairy?
let me go !
get off of me !
yo !
you want a piece of me?
aah !
the car wash : show me how it works .
show me .
ok .
ok , just don't hurt 'em .
please .
oh , what's the use?
no money means no christmas , no teeth , no us .
we might as well just fade away .
come on !
where's your spirit?
ahhh !
remember when you did easter duty after eating 400 pounds of fudge?
or the time your belt broke ... .. so you bored that boy back to sleep with the story of your life .
sir , you'd better have a look .
we're done for !
hunters !
they're coming !
this wouldn't be happening if we still had ... magic .
where are we going?
my house .
first time i ever have friends over and it has to be like this .
now arriving , ... .. fairy hunters .
the kids .
the kids !
showtime !
mom !
dad !
secure the exits .
gut the joint .
is it getting hot in here or is it just me?
a talking giant rabbit .
tommy , what's going on?
i know you .
you used to put your mother's bridgework under the pillow .
don't you know how greedy that is?
i call it initiative .
oh ho ho ho !
who are you , the cheesecake fairy?
mr plug , on behalf of the children of the world ... .. and all that is decent and good in the universe , ... .. i demand that you leave at once .
zip it , fuzzball .
you bet .
i'll ... be over here ... .. if anyone needs me .
who's the wacko?
i'm the easter bunny's evil twin .
the tooth fairy's ugly stepsister .
i'm roadkill to reindeer , sun lamps to snowmen .
i am ... the anti claus .
knock it off , plug !
mrs c?
she's back !
and she's bad .
run , plug .
while you still can .
ooh .
scary .
or , as my colleague here would say , ...
aaaaaarrrgghh !
what are you doing here?
i've come to help , old friend .
but why'd you leave us in the first place?
because the world had got greedy .
magic didn't matter any more ; money did .
but what i didn't realise is ... .. that there are a few loving and generous spirits ... .. still alive in this world .
all right , lady .
you wanna help?
prove it .
very well .
i've got your money .
the garbage men , they work for me .
they took your money to keep it safe .
what about m ... magic?
oh ...
back off , or fluffy gets it .
tolly , will you get back here? !
but he's the easter bunny !
nobody's called me that in years .
laugher .
tears .
nausea .
grab the kid .
no !
it's ok , we'll take care of this .
when we get to the top , bury them .
tolly !
they've sealed the ducts !
and cut the circuits .
ok ...
ok ...
ok ... whoa .
that is a long way up .
ok , is there another way out?
hold on .
he's burying us alive !
i know there's a way out .
you don't know anything .
help me out here , lady !
well , ... there is a way out .
you fly .
poppycock !
this is for you to do , for the ones you love .
magic is love , and wishes , and wanting to help other people .
and it's here .
deep inside .
like a kidney?
hello .
sceptical examiner?
you guys want the exclusive of a lifetime?
send your best man , and tell him to bring his camera .
what?
no , this is not another giant squid !
dad?
what's this?
no ...
it's his jacket .
dad !
ok , honey ...
dad !
dad?
honey?
honey !

er , ... hello?
h ... hello?
what are you doing?
got no choice !
i'm her dad !
what's gotten into you?
well , ... just ... had a chance to sleep on things .
you see?
that's magic .
on your left !
aaagh !
will you come down now , please , before you get hurt?
i'm , er , writing a new song for the band .
wanna know what it's about?
it's about you .
anyone who's put up with a flake like me deserves something beautiful .
there's just one problem .
i stink .
i've got no sense of rhythm .
and i ...
i think i'm tone deaf .
whoa !
no !
no !
can you bring him back?
bring him back !
tooth?
i gotta help !
then fly .
show me !
i can't .
it's inside you .
you have to want it .
enough kung fu mumbo jumbo , lady , i gotta save 'em !
wow !
that's it?
i get more lift from a bag of prunes .
she can do this .
but she needs all of you .
you have to want it , too .
if it means getting rabbit , and the little girl and her dad , ... .. then i want magic .
if it helps .
magic .
magic .
magic .
magic .
magic .
magic .
oh , why not?
magic .
take me with you .
i'll try .
still think she's a loser?
nah .
she's not a loser .
all right , people , let's kick some fairy hunter butt !
in the old fashioned way !
hi , dad .
gotta flyyyyyyyyyyy !
tom?
come on , sugar plum fairy , let's ... ride .
the sugar plum fairy ... .. was a wimp .
please make sure your seat back is upright ... .. and your tray table's in its stowed and locked position .
thank you !
yeeeah !
going underground !
watch out for the car !
welcome to the festival of cheese .
cheeeeeese !
ahhh !

sceptical examiner , where are you guys?
ugh !

blurrrrgh !

or i'll make you .

you and what army?
where have you been?

wings up and wands out .
forward !

in that !
cowards !
ow !
shut it , you .
as my mummy always says , never , ever , ever work without a hostage .
let her go , chucklehead .
the sceptical examiner was right .
you're just a big fat liar .
you ...
you worthless , ... .. lowlife , ... .. bottom feeding ... .. trailer trash !
yes , mummy .
i am .
i am worthy of his memory .
stage dive !
aaaaaarrrgghh !
tolly !
that tickles !
daddy , can we keep her?
she's so cute .
tolly , are you ok?
everything all right?
mr plug .
i've examined your claim thoroughly .
you're from the sceptical examiner !
oh !
afternoon .
did you see?
did you see inside?
as is typical of your claims with us , ... .. there is nothing extraordinary or unusual in any way to report .
but the rabbit ... and the zing ... and the wheeee ... and the zhooom ...
we're not in the fruitcake business , mr plug .
evidently you are .
please , shh , ... don't call again .
i've got video .
no !
no !
dad's here , we're all right .
we're all right .
tolly , you're all right , you're safe .
ohh , got you back .
got you back , got you all safe , goodness me .
how did you get here?
i ran , sweetheart .
i ran , darling , i ran all the way .
goodness me .
little t , are you all right?
ah , got you safe .
tom , tom !
come here .
come here , oh ... we saw fairies and they were flying !
there were fairy hunters , and they had a huge tunnel , and we won !
that's wonderful ... so , that's my story .
how me and my family and the craziest tooth fairy ever found magic again ... .. and got the holidays back on track .
ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ...
herbert the extractor escaped and became a professional soccer player .
those wacky golfers had a pretty good year .
and plug spent the rest of his holidays in jail .
as for my family , ... .. my dad started a car wash record store for the musically challenged ... .. and mom went to work for mrs c.
tolly got to keep the thing in the cage ... .. and she even got a new baby sitter .
everything's fine , mrs wallit .
you and mr wallit just try and enjoy yourselves .
ciao .
and me , ...
tom wallit?
i made a friend who liked me , ... .. even though i'm a flesh eating virus .
a friend who taught me that magic is inside all of us .
deep inside .
