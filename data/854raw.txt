and i earned the name .
my own prisoners built me .
every block of my granite is cemented by the blood of many men .
is it any wonder a man sometimes went berserk and fought the hated walls that shut him in? .

this was a common thing in those old days .
i had so little work for them to do ...

i want to see my daddy .
i want to go home , john .
please .
he's just got a job , sitting in there in san anton ... just waiting for us .
it's just sitting there ... it's just sitting there waiting ...
viv , the guys are here .
my band is here in memphis .
your band? .
john , your band? .
your band is two mechanics who can't hardly play .
baby , can't you hear the difference between you and that? .
you have your wife and your baby in a dump , john ... and another one on the way ... and we can't even make rent, john .
excuse me , sir .
are you the owner of this place? .
that's me .
hello , i 'm j. r. cash .
sam phillips .
well , good to meet you , mr. phillips .
i'm a singer and i've got a band ... and we've been working on some songs .
you want to cut a record , son? .
it's four dollars .
what about the guys there on the wall in the pictures? .
i mean , they pay four dollars? .
they're on my label .
how do i get on there? .
you audition .
right now? .
call my secretary , marion , when she comes back .
she's at the salon .
she'll set you up an appointment next month .
i can't wait that long , mr. phillips .
excuse me? .
i can't wait that long .
what about this one? .
i can iron it .
john , you can't wear that one .
it's black .
it's the only color shirt we all have .
nothing wrong with black .
it looks like you're going to a funeral .
maybe i am .
maybe i am .
hold on .
hold on .
i hate to interrupt ... but do you guys got something else? .
i 'm sorry .
i can't market gospel .
no more .
so that's it? .
i don't record material that doesn't sell , mr. cash ... and gospel like that doesn't sell .
was it the gospel or the way i sing it? .
both .
well , what's wrong with the way i sing it? .
i don't believe you .
you saying i don't believe in god? .
j. r. , come on , let's go .
no .
i want to understand .
i mean , we come down here , we play for a minute ... and he tells me i don't believe in god .
you know exactly what i'm telling you .
we've already heard that song a hundred times ... just like that , just like how you sang it .
well , you didn't let us bring it home .
bring ... bring it home? .
all right , let's bring it home .
if you was hit by a truck and you were lying out in that gutter dying ... and you had time to sing one song , huh , one song ... people would remember before you're dirt ... one song that would let
god know what you felt about your time here on earth ... one song that would sum you up ... you telling me that's the song you'd sing? .
that same jimmie davis tune we hear on the radio all day? .
about your peace within and how it's real and how you're gonna shout it? .
or would you sing something different? .
something real , something you felt? .
because i'm telling you right now ... that's the kind of song people want to hear .
that's the kind of song that truly saves people .
it ain't got nothing to do with believing in god , mr. cash .
it has to do with believing in yourself .
well , i've got a couple songs i wrote in the air force .
you got anything against the air force? .
no .
i do .
j. r. , whatever you're about to play ... we ain't never heard it .
where you been? .
are you drunk? .
what happened? .
he didn't like our gospel .
so i played him some songs that i wrote .
we made a record , viv .
i mean , a real , real record .
we did it like , like six times .
i had to sing the song over and over again .
and , uh , and playin 'it .
and you should have seen marshall .
he was so nervous .
but i mean , we made a real record
of my song .
oh , baby . of my song .
oh , baby .
never seen nobody play like that .
ladies and gentlemen ...

yeah .
yeah .
we liked it when you'd sing one alone .
well , you and jack are the only ones .
what do you mean? .
i'm not really much of a singer , johnny .
i mean , i got a lot of personality , i got sass ...
i give it my all , but my sister anita's really the one who's got the pipes .
well , who said that? .
everybody .
my mama , my daddy .
that's how come i learned to be funny ... so i'd have something to offer .
well ... parents aren't always the best judge of things ... if you want my opinion .
so how long you on the tour? .
another couple of weeks .
we just got on board , but ...
i tell you it feels like a lot longer .
i'm sure .
i'm headed off , i'm going to the ryman .
why don't you tell your brother, jack , to tune in ... and i'll sing him something .
what does he like? .
oh , that's that's sweet , but , uh , he passed .
i'm sorry .
were y'all real close? .
yeah .
yeah , he's , uh ...
it's funny , i ain't talked about jack in a long time , you know? .
after he died , i ...
i talked about him all the time ... but , uh ...
i guess people grew tired of it .
so i just stopped .
john? .
you're tired , aren't you? .
yeah .
it'll slow down .
it will .
i better get going .
it's good to talk to you .

viv , you're the one who brought it up .
