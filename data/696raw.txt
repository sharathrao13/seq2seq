rough night?
i got your message .
what's the problem?
i lost my keys .
where'd you find them?
four feet that way .
must've dropped them .
how you doing?
it's been a while .
fine .
how are you?
cold .
i , uh ...
i need to talk to you about something .
grab some lunch at fascastti's?
i have to get back to work .
speaking of which , i heard you got fired a few weeks ago .
what was it this time?
you really want to know?
or you're just enjoying the view from your high horse?
you know what i want?
to not have to be the older brother to my older brother .
what you doing here , crab?
long time no see , mr.
linc .
where you been?
here and there .
mm .
i'm gonna get your 90 grand , all right ...
oh , relax , man , that debt's already been paid .
by who?
someone who likes to do people favors .
i don't know what it is you're thinking you're getting , but let's be clear about something .
it's gonna be a few days before i get the money lined up .
let's not kid ourselves .
you can't get anywhere near that kind of money .
so let's talk about what you can do for me .
allies are like family .
we have disagreements , but we always seem to smooth things out by thanksgiving .
okay , if you had to choose ...
vice president reynolds or kathy in hr?
i'll take door number three .
come on , if you had to choose .
the chick in hr .
michael never cared much for blondes .
v.
how you doing , michael?
um , good .
i'm good .
how are you?
i'm okay .
you know , i'm over at glazer & ross .
lawyer # 97 .
benefits are good .
how's lincoln?
you guys haven't talked?
no , not for a few years .
he kind of dropped off the radar .
how is he?
he's , um ...
he's ...
he's linc .
i don't care who the guy is .
i ain't killing no one .
i must have missed the part where i gave you a choice .
black leather jacket .
two buttons down the front , three on each sleeve .
one missing on his left no , right arm .
jeans .
faded .
stain on the right knee .
he does bad things to good people .
think of this as a $90, 000 bullet .
you start fresh , and you keep me from finding out if there's someone in your life you will do something for .
uh , i should ...
i should call you a cab .
you know how you can tell god is a man?
shoes .
oh !
easy .
i'm sorry .
what?
it's , uh ...
you're gonna answer it?
he'll leave a message .
he always does .
michael , it's linc .
i need your help , bro .
i'm in something real bad .
i can't get out of it .
i need you to straighten me out .
my head is all messed up and ...
anyway , it's real important , bro .
you gotta call me .
you gotta call me now .
we can't do this .
i know .
i know .
i'll call you a cab .
did we get him?
i believe we did , partner .
whoo !
are you kidding?
nando , we should've whooped that guy's ass .
please , only time i seen you whoop some ass is when that old man cut in front of you at arby's .
and he was , like , 102 and blind .
with a plastic hip .
oh , my god .
w hat?
hey , they're waiting for you in 4b .
oh , pull his film .
i'll be there in a minute .
okay .
sergeant franklin , you never cease to amaze me .
is there anything you can't get here?
all right , a deal's a deal .
prison guard duty .
away from the front .
safest place you could be .
thank you .
and my wife and daughter back home thank you , too , sir .
these cold seams are pretty significant .
hey .
hi .
would you give us a minute?
thanks .
have you been watching the news?
why?
it's lincoln .
i didn't do it .
terrence steadman?
the vice president's brother .
do you have any idea what they're gonna do to you?
i didn't do it , man , it was a setup .
i didn't do it .
you knew him .
who?
steadman .
no .
you worked for his company .
so what?
from which you were fired a few weeks ago .
i loaded containers in the warehouse .
never met the guy .
what the hell , mike?
you sound like one of the damn detectives .
i'm just saying ...
you think i did it?
i heard you owe someone 90 grand .
who told you that?
people talk .
and i know steadman had a lot of money .
i may be a lot of things , but i'm not a murderer .
then what were you doing in that garage last night?
you admitted to the police you were there .
honestly , linc , i don't know how it's come to this .
and you can't keep blaming mom for dying and dad for leaving , because i was there , too .
difference is , i got out .
mom had life insurance , i took my half , put myself through school ,
what did you do with your half , linc?
everything's not how it looks , michael .
i hope for your sake , that's true .
here ... here is where we want the turn to anger .
trust me , that won't be a problem .
now remember to stress his record as a repeat offender .
we need the public behind us if we want the death penalty .
and where are we with governor tancredi?
he has aspirations .
he won't be a problem .
uh , 30 seconds , madam vice president .
the papers have already crucified him .
the police say they got a phone call right after the murder from someone claiming they saw lincoln running from the garage .
he was into someone for 90 grand .
what do you need that kind of money for?
drugs?
bribes?
forget about what you want to be true .
let's look at this objectively .
maybe you should , too .
i am .
all right , you know what?
i promised i wouldn't say anything , but i'm getting tired of you talking about him
like he's some guy from the neighborhood that you used to know .
he's your brother .
i know , and i know he helped you out with your dad back in the day , but you should see the kind of person he is now the kind of people he keeps friends with .
you want to know what the 90 grand was for?
i think i do .
you .
what do you mean?
the money you got when you were 18 years old from your mother's life insurance .
the money that paid for your degree , that got you this job , that bought you your loft .
your mother never had life insurance .
that money came from lincoln .
how?
he borrowed it .
knew it would be tough to pay back , but that didn't matter , because he thought you deserved it .
he also knew you'd never accept it if you knew it came from him .
michael .... you are where you are because of your brother .
you're telling me he is where he is because of me?
why?
why didn't you tell me about the money?
no need to .
lincoln ...
who told you?
veronica?
what did she make of all this?
about me?
i don't know .
glad she got out when she did , huh?
you know how she feels about you .
it's been the same way ever since we were kids .
yeah .
linc ...
i owe you an apology .
for what?
the night you called .
if we talked , maybe i could have stopped you ...
hey , hey , hey , hey .
it's not your fault .
then whose is it?
listen up .
you need to forget about this .
move on .
work hard , do what you do .
i can't do that .
oh , yes , you can .
and you will .
here's the part i don't understand .
all the evidence is lining up in a path that leads directly to you .
they say they have you on tape .
pulling the trigger .
if you didn't kill terrence steadman ...
how the hell did someone make it look like you did?
perfect .
perfect's a strong word , cuz .
i got strong feelings , bro .
i'm telling you , she might be the one .
she from the block?
nope .
uptown .
pill hill .
do you think you could hold on to a girl from the ph?
i want to take her out to dinner .
you'll see .
someplace real nice .
come on , fernando .
how are you going to afford a place like that?
open the drawer !
hey , hey , okay !
open the drawer !
yo , yo !
okay , okay !
quick !
quick !
quick !
all right , okay !
now !
actually ...
this is all i need .
okay .
appreciate your business , man .
ah ...
i brought you a gift from the hospital .
oh !
oh ...
i brought you a gift from the hospital .
i'm telling you , this is like christmas .
and you ... work at the north pole .
if the north pole had gunshot wounds and ...
seriously , i don't know how you work there .
what do you mean?
i like to help people .
and you like helping yourself .
and you like helping your friend .
oh , my god .
oh , my god !
call somebody !
who's got a telephone? !
call 911 !
help !
are you a doctor?
well , do something !
at ease .
the whiskey that you ordered , sir , will be here in a couple of days .
that's fine .
i actually brought you here to talk to you about something else .
prisoner abuse report you filed?
yes , sir .
i need to know how far you're willing to go with this .
whatever it takes , sir .
i particularly have no love for the desert donkeys , but i do have some for the geneva convention .
something like this gets out , might open up our boys to similar treatment from the enemy .
i understand that , sir .
but i'm not planning on calling a press conference .
what i'm saying is , what i saw was wrong , and someone needs to take responsibility for it , sir .
all right .
please take mr.
franklin into custody .
what?
what the hell is going on , sir? !
sergeant franklin , i'm hereby recommending that you be dishonorably discharged from the united states army .
what? !
for what?
for engaging in illegal , black market ...
you asked me to get that stuff !
i kept it to myself .
maybe you should learn to do the same .
you can't do this .
you can't do this !
you cannot do this !
has the jury reached a verdict?
we have , your honor .
what say you?
in the matter of the people of the state of illinois v. lincoln burrows , on the count of murder in the first degree , we find the defendant guilty .
the defendant will remain in custody until one week from today , when we commence the penalty phase .
lincoln .
i'm so sorry , linc .
don't be .
it's not your fault .
know what i like?
hmm?
how after we make love ... you get this little puddle of water in your belly button .
fernando , that's sweat !
and get out of there !
it's disgusting there !
i think it's beautiful .
i think you're beautiful .
what do you want , fernando?
oh , you got to give me a few more minutes .
stop !
from the future .
what do you want from the future?
would you run if i said you?
would you chase me if i did?
i don't get it .
all these commercials show brothers learning computer skills , new technologies .
uncle sam didn't teach me nothing but cadence and kill .
you check over at the price mart?
ain't hiring .
especially with a brother with a dishonorable discharge .
goes right to the bottom of the pile .
how long you think you gonna keep this up?
until somebody gives me a job .
nah , i'm talking about lying to kacee .
your unit's been on leave for a long damn time now .
pretty soon they gonna stop thinking you're lucky , and she's gonna start asking questions .
yeah , well , then i need to start finding some answers .
look , i happen to know of an employment opportunity .
come on , man , you know i don't get down like that .
it's just driving a truck .
yeah .
a to b. that's it .
uncle sam taught you how to drive trucks , didn't he?
yeah .
he also taught me to look inside .
it might be illegal , but it's also rent .
a to b , your call .
yeah .
they didn't even let her testify .
who?
leticia barris .
and that cop?
changed his story a dozen times .
what part of " move on " don't you get?
after mom died , and it was just you and me .
i remember having trouble sleeping , never knowing where you were .
but when i'd wake up in the morning , there'd be this paper bird , an origami crane , sitting next to my bed .
and i never knew what it meant exactly , but i figured it was your way of letting me know you were checking in on me .
anyway , i looked it up .
the crane .
it stands for familial obligation ... watching out for your own .
maybe it's my turn to watch out for you .
so , same time tomorrow .
no , man , they're , uh , transferring me to a prison where i wait until they execute me .
can i still visit?
yeah .
it's not that far .
place called fox river .
fox river?
yeah .
why?
nothing .
how come there's four?
well , uh , mommy's new friend is coming over for dinner again .
again?
he just came over last night .
i like him .
well , i do , too .
and i want you both to be extra polite , because he's stopping by malarkey's on his way home from work , and he's bringing us a really good meal .
in fact , you two go wash your hands .
evening , mrs. hollander .
don't you look lovely this evening .
ay ...
i'm gonna do it .
do what?
i'm gonna propose to maricruz .
are you serious?
when?
as soon as i can afford the ring .
so what , like , 10 , 20 years?
what's your problem , man?
why can't you just be happy for me?
i'm just trying to protect you .
what , you think you can give her everything she wants?
takes more than money to do that .
you know i love you , cuz .
just think you should look at the reality here .
seriously , primo , how are you gonna afford a ring for a girl like that , huh?
open the door !
hey , hey , hey , okay , okay !
now !
hey , this fine?
actually , i'm gonna need a little bit more this time .
okay , okay .
here you go .
i'm sorry .
okay .
anyone asking questions?
not loud enough to hear .
god , i can't remember the last time i was this much of a nervous wreck .
school board , second term , 1992?
secluded , no real access roads , perfect for what you're looking for .
only one problem .
what's that?
it's over $2 million .
didn't my poor brother , terrence , leave something for me in his will?
you'd have to ask your accountants , ma'am .
tell them to use that money .
i'm paying for his mistake ; he can pay for the damn house .
and i've been clean for 18 months now .
i'll tell you , i've never been happier .
that actually might be the wrong word .
i'll be honest , there were times i was using i left pretty damn happy .
but ... what i feel is different now .
i feel , uh ...
i feel joy .
so here i am .
i know that ... all i can do every day is the next right thing .
and i think , for me right now , that means going back to work .
i , uh ...
i don't know , maybe ... maybe counseling , um ...
i want to help people get from where i've been to where i am .
hey , sara .
you used to be a doctor , right?
uh , i still am , in theory .
why?
well , i was just thinking that
i might know of a job opening where i work .
really?
where's that?
you ever heard of fox river?
the prison?
yeah .
i know it sounds like a strange idea .
uh , maybe ... maybe you and i could , uh ... maybe we could talk about it over dinner .
i got a gift card to the red lobster over off the interstate .
oh , my god .
um ...
thank you .
really .
uh ...
i ...
tonight's kind of my night to work on my resume .
um ...
oh .
yeah .
'course .
sorry .
i , uh ...
but thank you , really , for the , um , the referral .
fox river .
yeah .
you know , math was never my best subject , either .
but , um ...
i got through it by learning some new tricks .
you want to learn some tricks , gracey?
like what?
like your nine times tables .
ready?
nine times one is ...
nine .
nine times two is ...
eight ... een .
teen .
yeah .
nine times three is ...
twenty seven !
exactly .
you got it .
now keep on going .
mommy , mommy , did you see what teddy taught me?
yes .
that's great , honey .
go show your brother .
zack , look .
nine times one ...
thank you .
right , right , left , left ...
hey .
um , thank you .
let me get your change .
you want your change?
keep it .
hey .
hey .
daddy !
hey , sweetheart , come here .
hey , there .
hey .
you know , i got , uh ...
i got to tell you something .
and it's going to be really hard to hear .
okay .
okay .
what?
well , the thing is ...
... i'm being shipped back off .
what?
yeah , um , my unit just got called back for another tour , baby .
i can't believe it .
deployment orders just came down .
with the italians pulling out and everything ...
tell them no , daddy !
aw .
yo , b !
come here , baby .
can you give me a hand with something out back?
that's my sister you're lying to in there .
which is why i know you're gonna take care of them when i'm gone .
this is crazy .
maybe .
so is the way i got kicked out the army .
so's the way i got busted for driving that truck .
and so's the way i feel about that woman up in there .
she married a military man , who knows how to take care of his business .
now , if i look like one of these thugs , now ... what do you think she's gonna do?
huh?
how long you think she's gonna wait for me while i'm inside?
i don't know , man .
you owe me this , man .
don't you ever let her know where i am .
you feel me?
usually , i do this the other way .
why do you want to ...
i want what i want .
you show this to anyone else ...
i am calling the whole thing off .
my therapist said ... she said that i'm holding too much in and that i need to confront you to let you know how betrayed i feel .
i let you into my life , my home ...
my god , i let you near my children !
i never touched them .
you should have told me what you were .
you think you're the only one who feels betrayed?
i ... loved you , susan .
real love .
for the first time in my life .
and then to have you do me like that , to just throw me out to the dogs , just toss me out the back door like ...
you're a murderer , teddy !
that's not ...
i have sinned in the past , but when i met you , that person , that one that did all those terrible things , he died , and i was reborn .
by the grace of your love , i was a ... a new man , a better man .
no .
that doesn't just erase the man who killed 6 students in alabama .
i guess that's where you're right .
'cause when you sent me here , to this place , with these people , it brought that old , dirty bastard right back home .
in fact , there was a candle in the window , just waiting for me to walk up them front steps .
you know , i'm gonna ...
i'm gonna get out of here someday .
and when i do ...
... don't think i won't remember what your front steps look like , susan .
it's almost over .
burrows will be dead soon , and then things will start getting back to normal .
i know that you've been through a lot , but i promise you , the worst is now behind us .
my dear sister ... ... you have no idea what i've been through .
good night , terrence .
