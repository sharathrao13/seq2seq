it's still on , and we're going .
cyrus sent an emissary this afternoon to make sure .
cyrus don't want anybody packed or anybody flexing any muscle .
so i gave him my word that the warriors would uphold the truce .
everybody says that cyrus is the one and only .
i think we'd better go have a look for ourself .
we ain't even been to the bronx .
no sweat .
this conclave's a big item .
every gang in the city will be there .
we're going in with nothing .
we're going in like everybody else .
nine guys , no weapons .
you got the stuff?
i want you to hit everything in sight .
i want everybody to know the warriors were there .
you never what you're gonna run into .
in our colours , we can't hide .
who wants to hide?
maybe we'll get to waste some heads along the way .
you just soldier and keep your mouth shut .
when we get there , stick close by .
sure , i don't want to get wrecked .
one thing we might get out of cyrus's get together is meeting some strange wool .
i wouldn't mind laying something down on the way back .
you got a one track brain .
what's up?
you going faggot?
what do you know about cyrus?
magic .
whole lot of magic .
what do you know about cyrus?
he's the one and only .
when you're president of the biggest gang , you don't take any shit .
fuck him !
i tell you something .
i'll bet nobody's even gonna be there .
can you count , suckers?
i say the future is ours ... ... if you can count .
come on , cyrus .
we're with you !
go ahead , bro !
look what we have here before us .
we've got the saracens sitting next to the jones street boys .
we've got the moon runners , right by the van courtland rangers .
nobody is wasting nobody .
that ... is a miracle .
and miracles is the way things ought to be .
yeah !
all right .
i heard that !
you're standing right now with nine delegates from a hundred gangs .
and there's over a hundred more .
that's 20, 000 hard core members 40, 000 , counting affiliates , and 20, 000 more not organised , but ready to fight .
60, 000 soldiers !
there ain't but 20, 000 police in the whole town .
can you dig it?
can you dig it?
can you dig it?
now , here's the sum total .
one gang could run this city .
one gang !
nothing would move without us allowing it to happen .
we could tax the crime syndicates , the police , because we got the streets , suckers .
can you dig it?
right on !
the problem in the past has been the man turning us against one another .
we've been unable to see the truth , because we've been fighting for ten square feet of ground our turf , our little piece of turf .
that's crap , brothers .
the turf is ours by right because it's our turn .
all we have to do is keep up the general truce .
we take over one borough at a time .
secure our territory , secure our turf , because it's all our turf .
the other way , against the crowd !
keep your ass down !
down !
get out of the way .
watch out , man .
watch his head .
what's up with that?
there wasn't supposed to be guns .
is cleon all right?
i think he's up there .
are you sure?
no .
come on , move it !
there he is !
that's him !
that's the warrior !
he shot cyrus !
i didn't do nothing .
we saw him !
that's him .
he's the one .
he's the one !
the warriors did it !
the warriors did it !
kill him !
come on !
move it !
everybody down !
shit !
you all right?
yeah .
everybody quiet !
everybody make it?
just cleon's missing .
fuzz must have got him .
did you see him?
i seen him , then he wasn't there .
i was haulin 'ass .
look around .
make sure we're ok .
this is a graveyard .
what are we gonna do now?
we're going back .
how? !
fuckin 'coney island must be fifty to a hundred miles from here .
it's our only choice .
real simple .
except every cop in the city's lookin 'to bust our heads .
there's something else to think about .
the truce , is it still on?
if it ain't , we're gonna have to bop our way back .
shit , i wish we was packed .
if this truce is off , anything could hit us between here and that train .
if you get separated , make it to the platform at union square .
we change trains there .
i only got one question .
who named you leader?
i got as much right to take over as you .
it was cleon's choice .
swan's war chief .
right now , cleon's probably got a nightstick shoved up his ass .
i bet you can't even find the subway .
let's talk about this later .
what's wrong with now?
i want to be war lord .
make your move .
hey , ajax , lighten up .
big boy , swan's war chief .
we better stick together .
hey , you guys , the train's there .
come on .
hurry up .
let's go .
let's move .
don't worry about it .
stay loose .
ah , fuck !
rembrandt , mark this spot .
hey , wait for me !
riffs !
yeah , right !
who are the warriors?
there must be some word .
i want them all .
i want all the warriors .
i want them alive , if possible .
if not , wasted .
but i want them .
send the word .
all right , for all you boppers out there in the big city , you street people with an ear for the action ,
i've been asked to relay a request from the gramercy riffs .
it's a special for the warriors .
that's that real live bunch from coney .
and i do mean the warriors .
here's a hit with them in mind .
be looking good , warriors , all the way back to coney .
you hear me , babies?
good .
real good .
adios .
what kind of crap is this?
what are we waiting for?
a train would help , unless you want to get japped on the platform .
there ain't no one on the street .
we're acting like faggots .
just keep talking .
move .
that's the turnbull a. c. 's .
they forgot about the truce .
no shit !
those lousy skinheaded fucks .
that's our train .
we got to make it .
jesus christ !
are we gonna go for it?
hold the fucking train !
go , go , go !
close the fucking door !
shit !
all right , warriors !
those guys were desperate dudes .
so was we !
we can take 'em .
bunch of chicken shits !
they didn't look too chicken to me .
me , either .
well , we made it .
in an hour , it's c. i. the big coney .
you got it .
give me that fist .
when we get there , we've made it .
hey , no sweat , war chief .
i've got coney island !
how many stops to union square?
come on , man .
that's high math for rembrandt .
it's all right .
nobody can read these maps .
what's the difference?
we're home free .
we just heard from the turnbulls .
they blew it .
shit .
this train's had it .
this is fuckin 'impossible .
what are we gonna do?
this sucks !
why couldn't it rain now?
we should worry about who set that goddamn fire .
come on .
yeah .
how are you?
i was just checking in .
yeah , it was a real mess up there .
this guy cyrus had an accident .
they did?
well , that's ok .
these guys , the warriors ...
yeah .
they deserve it .
yeah .
we will .
take care of yourself .
we set?
we're set , all right .
somebody should pick them up .
the riffs sent out the word , they want 'em alive .
we don't .
the sooner someone grabs them , the better .
you afraid the warriors will talk before they get racked?
i'm worried .
i don't want the riffs after me .
they're looking for the warriors , remember?
we can do some looking , too .
ought to make you feel better .
what about the money you owe?
for what?
we've had it .
i made 'em .
two there , one there .
i think they just made us .
you recognise them?
orphans .
so far down , they ain't even on the map .
real low class .
numbers .
full strength , maybe 30 .
a lot more than eight .
not if they're wimps .
i'm sick of this running crap .
come on .
this way .
know where he's headed?
yeah , reinforcements .
we're gonna get japped here !
no matter what he says , nobody lip off .
nobody get hot .
i'll see what i can do .
when did you turn into a diplomat?
you ain't the state department type .
fox , come with me .
show me your invitation .
how do you figure?
well , you come armying down here , invading our territory no permits , no parley .
we're not invading .
i'm parleying now .
we were at the meeting in the bronx .
we're going home to coney , the train's messed up by the fire and dumps us here .
what are you talking about?
how could there be a meeting without the orphans?
you didn't miss anything .
a lot of heads got busted .
you think the orphans ain't with it?
that we ain't well known?
we didn't say that .
we got a heavy rep .
mess with us , you'll find out .
you see that?
our raids are in the paper .
that's really heavy .
the orphans , right?
our youth worker talks about you .
we ain't got one .
that's because you guys are so bad , they're afraid of you .
nothing wrong with you making it through our territory , as long as you're coming in peace .
cut it , mercy .
you know what that is?
yeah .
trouble .
those vests are real nice .
stop looking for trouble now .
should have slapped your mouth .
who stopped you?
come on .
give me one .
just one .
i just want one vest .
you can get another one , man .
no chance .
you letting armies walk through here any time they want?
how will it look?
get lost .
soon , every gang will boogie right in , soldier right through .
i'll tell you , some man you are .
take your colours off , you can walk through .
we don't do that .
it don't mean we're at war .
you go as civilians , or i gotta come down on you .
take off your colours .
you hear me?
fuck you .
we're not gonna hide who we are because some whore shakes her ass .
don't call me no whore .

he says he saw who shot cyrus .
big cyrus , he was going to run the whole city .
what crap that was .
cyrus was right about one thing .
it's all out there .
we've just got to figure out how to steal it .
sounds great .
you've just got to figure out what's worth stealing .
ok , come on , let's go .
let's get out of here .
what's this for?
i just hate seeing anything go to waste .
this is what we fought all night to get back to?
maybe i'll just take off .
you know i like travelling , too .
where have you ever been?
i've never been anywhere .
i just know i'd like it .
come on .
let's go .
stay right on their ass .
wait a couple seconds after we move , then cut out the other way .

when we see the ocean , we figure we're home , we're safe .
this time , you got it wrong .
why'd you do it?
why'd you waste cyrus?
no reason .
i just like doing things like that .
let's do it , me and you .
one on one?
you're crazy .
you're dead , all of you , and you know it .
you're dead .
swan !
riffs !

it wasn't us .
it was them , the warriors .
you warriors are good , real good .
the best .
the rest is ours .
good news , boppers .
the big alert has been called off .
it turns out the early reports were wrong , all wrong .
for that group that had a hard time getting home , sorry about that .
i guess the only thing we can do is play you a song .
