...
i don't know .

how's your business going?
did you sell all that pudding?
the pudding is not a sales item ...
why?
it's ... not for sale .

why is that?
i'd rather not say , if that's ok .
oh , i'm sorry , was it like a secret pudding?
let's just keep it between you and i , if that's possible?
sure , sure .
healthy choice and american airlines got together for this promotion ...
if you buy any 10 of healthy choice products they'll reward you 500 frequent flyer miles ... ... with a special coupon they'll up it to a 1000 miles .
so i think they're trying to push their teriyaki chicken which is 1 . 79 usd ...
but i went to the supermarket , i looked arround and i saw that they had pudding at 0 . 25 usd/ cup .
comes in packages of four , but insanely ... ... the barcodes are on the individual cups !
so , a quarter of a cup ... say you bought 2 . 50 usd worth ...
that's worth 500 miles , ... with the coupon it's a 1000 miles ...
it's a marketing mistake but i'm taking advantage of it .
if you already spent 3000 usd ... that will get you a million frequent flyer miles ... ... you would never have to pay for a ticket for the rest of your life !
so you put a lot pudding so you can get free coupons .
yes .
that's insane !
i'm guessing it was a mistake ... but i'm taking advantage of the wallets offered .
who knows how long it will last !
too many peoples start doing it !
