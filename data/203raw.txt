t'a lin is the land for burying monks of shao lin
nobody is allowed without the abbot's permission .

yes !
i didn't mean to kill you
i think it's good of me , to bury you in this scenic place

i ...
you are not buddhist and you are outside the temple you need not obey our law you may eat
you have eaten before , aren't you?
this is usually cook with ginger wolfberry's fruit ...
but it is my first time see this way of cooking
you are tired enough for caring me and you should take some rich food
amida buddha
as a buddhist it's guilty even to think of it
it's hard to enjoy such good food
no one will come here , you may eat
master ...
master ...
master during these years in shao lin temple we work more than we eat
it's tired it's hard to have this rich food
you have one
master , let's eat together
these buddhists came here when they were in danger
in such case , so they aren't so devoted
let's eat , it taste good ...
master , then aren't we breaking the law?
with buddha in your heart wine and meat are nothing
we must have buddha in heart and help people
no need to worry about too much
i understand
with buddha in your heart wine and meat are nothing
brother shih k'ung realized this already
big monk , he?
love can't be forgotten
shih k'ung
wine increase sadness , don't get drunk
we've eaten hsiao hu's dog and we haven't requite
master , monks have nothing nothing to requite
shih k'ung , aren't you hurt?
he's drunken
the fool
shih k'ung
big monk , he?
he looks drunk but he isn't drunk
looks drunk but not drunk?
drunken stick?
yes , years ago when his wife was giving birth he was so happy that he bought a large pot of wine
but , his wife had been killed by the robber wang jen tse
so he became very fond of wine
every day he is sad and drunk
and that made him to create the drunken stick
he has such smart kung fu why don't he revenge?
can't defeat so many enemies alone somebody
hide
get away
amida buddha .
it's a sin
ya wong .
ya wong

look at this girl !
is she really your daughter?
this girl had no mother since she was a baby
at that time i was being attacked by wang jen tse and was force to hide myself in shao lin temple
so i made her stay at a farmer's home
the old man spoiled her because he had no kids
i must kill wang jen tse for revenge
please teach me shao lin kung fu
the temple has rule kung fu is use for protection it cannot be learnt by other people
you aren't shao lin monks , i ...
i'm willing to become a monk
no killing
it bite me
the temple's door is widely opened for good man to enter
he seems enjoying to kill
the temple cannot allow him
buddhist should be merciful
chueh yuan wills to cut his hair he has been good
unwilling to do evils willing to achieve goodness must task to save all people
chueh yuan , what's the matter?
master , i have been a monk for nearly three months
besides get water and cut wood bricks i stand here all day long
when will you teach me shao lin kung fu?
it's only three months look at your senior brothers
smoke coming out from head holes made by foot
this vajra breaking power needs three to five years of practicing
what?
just stand like this need three to five years
remember , practice kung fu don't fear bitterness
i'll remember
chueh yuan , good !
stop it !
shao lin kung fu is for defense and not attack
you look like enjoying to kill
you're punished to face the wall for three days !
oh brother !
brother
aren't you afraid of being punished again?
i ...
go back to your work !
should we regard killing mosquito as a sin?
if that is so how can i revenge my father's death?
why should i be a monk without learning kung fu?
it is not that easy to be a monk
i don't want to be a monk any more
