i'm pretty hungry .
i hope we catch some fish soon .
help me wind .
turn this one .
slowly .
slowly .
i am doing it slowly .
oh matty , look .
you see that big boat?
she is the prettiest boat on whidbey island .
the " morning star " .
some day i'll teach you to sail .
it's the best thing there is .
better than fishing?
yep .
but you know what , kiddo?
i don't think i want you to grow up .
what if you marry some beautiful girl?
who's going to sail with me then?
dad?
not a chance .
nick , we need to talk .
always happy to talk to you , rudy .
hey , warren .
get that notice from first seattle?
yeah , as a matter of fact , i did .
then you know we've got a problem .
first seattle is not a problem .
these martinis are a problem .
do you mind?
where were we?
first seattle ...
mommy .
hey , kiddo .
how's it going?
hand off .
he's a sack of potatoes .
you've carried him around the whole party?
we'll never marry you off .
yes .
picasso .
blue period .
the artist's name is kandinsky .
wassily kandinsky .
german , of russian extraction .
1866 1944 .
by the way , picasso's blue period was figurative , and ended in 1904 .
these watercolours are abstract , done in 1911 .
picasso .
everyone , pipe down .
i'm about to give a speech .
the sign of a good party is when i'm having a better time than anyone else .
but now is the time you ante up , for drinking my liquor , eating my food .
spilling tomato sauce on my couch ...
bobby long .
you didn't think i saw you?
he is insufferable .
the small frye school needs cash .
so while you're reaching for your cheque books ...
i'm pleased to introduce rebecca tingley , our ravishing headmistress .
mr parsons .
thank you .
i'd like to start by introducing a few members of my valuable staff .
our dedicated teacher , and head of admissions , miss angela green .
what are you thinking about?
was i always as rude as i am now?
absolutely .
hi .
come have a seat .
should we break the news to her?
it's best she hears it from us .
she's not going to be happy about it .
what's up , guys?
close your eyes .
close them .
stand up .
libby , what is your favourite thing?
me?
not even close .
all right , open .
i made sean an offer .
he agreed to let us take her out for the weekend .
if you like it , it's yours .
if i like it?
we can't afford it .
have i ever let that get in my way?
what about matty?
i'll take care of him .
it'll be great .
you hate to sail .
i can learn .
generally , a wine like this needs time to breathe .
i don't think we should ... wait .
i don't see land .
so where is it?
alaska's that way , japan is straight ahead , and australia is off to the left .
where would you like to go?
bed .
that can be arranged .
we should do this more often .
what , buy expensive sailboats?
if this is what happens , i'll buy you another one tomorrow .
no , go away , just the two of us , with nobody else around .
i'll drink to that .
nick?
nick?
oh , my god ...
nick?
nick ...?
nick?
nick? !
oh , my god .
oh , my god .
nick?
this is the coastguard .
put the knife down and step away .
i ...
i don't know ...
i don't know where my husband is .
hey , tom .
what have you got for me?
anything?
no .
cutter , please don't let them give up .
he's a very strong man .
the raft and life preservers are all on board .
these guys tracked the wind , the currents ...
there's nothing .
the water temperature overnight was 51 degrees .
that's really cold .
i can't breathe .
just put your head down .
deep breaths .
big breaths .
mommy , look !
hey , kiddo .
hey , bobby .
hey , libby .
cutter asked me to come by and talk to you .
not as an attorney , just as a friend .
the inquest was held this morning .
nick's officially been declared dead .
libby , they determined it was a wrongful death , and you ...
jesus ...
you're being formally charged with his murder .
i'm here to advise you , make no statements whatsoever to the sheriff .
i'm sorry , libby .
cutter !
not in front of my kid , okay?
i'm sorry , libby .
the judge denied us bail .
can angie keep looking after matty?
good .
okay ...
let's take a look at this , see what we can do .
bobby , here's what i think happened .
i had some wine .
and i fell asleep .
it must have been the sun .
maybe nick was trying to cut a snagged line , because ... the knife from the galley was on deck .
and maybe the boat pitched , and he cut himself .
and he tried to come below to wake me up .
i quit these when i met nick .
it'll be all right .
i promise you .
why don't we take a look at this first guarantee life?
you both bought insurance policies from the company four months ago .
and you are the beneficiary?
i'm his wife .
you know it's worth two million?
he wanted everything to be okay .
i'm afraid the jury may see the two million as a motive .
is that what they're saying out there?
no one is saying ...
that i killed nick for money?
i know we had problems , and nick worried , but we were okay .
two of his investors were suing him for embezzlement .
first seattle issued a lien on all his properties , your possessions ...
nick's death erases these problems , leaving you with two million dollars .
do you think i killed him?
what lawyers think doesn't matter .
it matters to me .
no , of course , i don't think you killed him .
what was the condition of the radio when you had a chance to inspect it?
the handset cord had been cut .
and as you approached the boat ,
what did you see?
mrs parsons was holding a knife .
i show you state's exhibit number four .
mayday , mayday , this is " morning star " .
state your emergency .
i've been stabbed .
i'm bleeding .
jesus ...
my name is nicholas parsons .
state your position?
i don't know .
three miles northwest of whidbey island , i guess .
oh , god !
mrs parsons , you've heard the testimony , and your explanation is that someone must have boarded the boat .
that's right .
well , let's consider all the possibilities .
maybe a band of pirates .
or aliens .
did aliens murder your husband?
no , aliens weren't beneficiaries in your husband's life insurance .
objection .
the prosecutor ...
overruled .
i told you what happened .
you told us that you were asleep .
maybe you were sleepwalking when you stabbed him to death .
this isn't a closing argument .
withdrawn .
i didn't kill my husband .
i loved my husband .
i did not kill my husband !
you have to believe me .
i'm sorry , libby .
it's not your fault , bobby .
i want to ask you something , angie .
i'd like you to adopt my son .
i can't do that .
not to you .
i've thought it through .
i barely survived my parents 'house .
i'm not going to put him there .
money's no problem .
the two million is going into a trust fund in his name .
it isn't about money .
i know .
matty loves you .
we can't let him become a ward of the state .
thank you .
hey kiddo , come see me .
you're going to stay with angie for a while .
and you're going to have lots of fun .
i know you're going to be a good boy .
yes , mommy .
as soon as all this is over , we'll be together again .
that's a promise , kiddo .
i love you .
i love you too .
who's this?
rich bitch from whidbey island .
she ain't gonna make it .
what do you think?
a year?
five cartons says she offs herself inside of six months .
get away from me .
take it easy .
we're your friends .
heard you did your husband .
he probably deserved it .
mine did .
i know what a pain it is to get here .
i taught him how to say the abc's .
is that true?
yes .
did you learn the alphabet , sweetie?
can you tell me?
a , b , c , d , e , f , g ,
h , i , j , k , l , m , n , o , p ,
q , r , s , t , u , v ,
w , x , y and z.
now i know my abc's next time won't you sing with me
give it up .
come on .
get off the phone , bitch .
you're low on cigarettes .
you wanna make friends?
buy another pack fast .
'cause your personality ain't the best i've ever seen .
you're trying to reach your friend , the one with your boy?
yeah , i can't find him .
he disappeared .
if you could disappear that easy , i wouldn't be here now .
me either .
think .
use your head .
there's got to be a way to track him down .
small frye school .
front office .
hello , this is angela green .
angie , it's jennifer .
it's nice to hear your voice .
i haven't got a severance cheque in a while .
do you have my correct address and phone number?
i'll check .
can you hold on a sec?
yes , of course .
thank you .
yeah , i have itrighthere .
tell me ifthis is right .
3321 mason street , san francisco 94105 .
the phone numberis 415 ...
hello?
angie?
libby , i've tried to call you .
is matty okay?
where is he?
everything is fine .
why are you in san francisco?
puthim on the phone .
why are you acting this way?
you disappeared !
i haven't seen my son in a month !
i was just about to call you .
bullshit !
how can you move and not tell me?
we were coming next week .
just put matty on the phone .
matty , it's mommy .
come say hi .
hi , mommy .
hello , sweetie pie .
how are you , matty?
i think about you all the time .
i miss you so much .
are you doing okay?
i love you .
i know this has been really hard , but angie's going to bring you up to see me next week .
yes , mommy ...
daddy !
nick?
he was in san francisco last night .
the number is already disconnected .
no , i don't have a forwarding address .
he's gone .
don't you have investigators?
doesn't your company want its two million?
why aren't you listening to me?
i am innocent .
put some elbow grease into it .
no one wants burnt tapioca .
does it smell like it's burning?
you got shit for brains , girl .
you're in prison .
do you get that?
so you can forget about re opening your case , or a jailhouse appeal .
they take years , and they're 95 % unsuccessful .
so if you want my advice , and you're gonna get it , you do your time .
what are you now , a lawyer?
once upon a time .
but they tend to disbar murderers .
here's your christmas present ...
pay attention , this is the best advice you're ever gonna get .
you ever hear of something called double jeopardy?
it provides that no person may be tried for the same crime twice .
they say you killed your husband .
they can't convict you a second time .
when you leave , track him down .
when you find him , you can kill him .
you can walk right up to him , put a gun to his head and pull the trigger .
and there's nothing anybody can do about it .
makes you feel warm and tingly all over , don't it?
that's right , keep stirring .
i got to hand it to you , honey , it's sheer hate driving you on .
the only way you'll look like that is if i staple the picture to your head .
mattys eighth birthday , honey .
i read that even if a child is separated from its mother at birth , it never forgets her voice .
you think that's true?
of course i do .
" i've grown these past six years .
they don't want you to be a tree .
if i could trade places with my husband , i would .
and throw in that born again jesus stuff .
i'm not sitting in front of you to make excuses ...
i'm not sitting in front of you today to try and make any excuses .
i killed my husband .
i've lived with that for six years .
but i'm a changed person .
why should we believe you?
i can't ask you to believe me .
all i can do is believe in myself .
i know that , if i'm given a chance , i can do something good with my life .
make up for the wrong i did .
mommy , talk to me .
man , did you see that?
... if the people who did that showed up here ...
the man's across the hall .
thanks .
let's imagine that ...
come in .
i'm elizabeth parsons .
what do you have in that box?
elizabeth parsons ...
the state of washington has granted you a conditional parole .
for three years , no fighting , no fornicating , no drinking or drugs .
no exceptions .
do you understand?
yes .
this is your social security card .
you will find sustained employment .
you're not to carry a weapon of any kind , especially a knife .
curfew's at 8 : 30 .
my cell phone number .
if there's a chance you'll be five minutes late , you will call me .
i will have you picked up .
if you violate these conditions , your parole will be revoked by me .
you'll return to prison to serve the remainder of your sentence .
is this a problem for you?
no .
yes , it is .
want to tell me about it?
no .
i'm gonna have trouble with you .
no , i learned my lesson ...
i'm only interested in your behaviour .
behave yourself .
you're in room 8 .
you're never going to get anywhere like that .
here ...
nice shampoo ...
what are you looking for?
a friend i haven't seen in a few years .
boyfriend ...?
girl .
in that case , i'll help you .
does your friend have e mail?
i have no idea .
okay , let's do some surfing .
what's your friend's name?
angela green .
zip code?
social security number?
we can run a credit report and get her address .
she was a schoolteacher .
done deal .
and ... voil .
maybe when this thing is finished searching we could go to this bar i know and get a drink .
what do you say?
after i check with my parole officer .
you've been to jail?
prison .
jail is a different thing .
what did you do , not pay your parking tickets?
i was convicted of murdering my husband .
you're kidding , right?
no , i'm not .
sliced and diced .
can you believe that?
you're not kidding .
no , i said i wasn't .
but it'd be nice to have a drink .
i haven't been out in a long time .
i have this appointment ...
see you .
see you .
oh , the book .
see you .
oh , my god .
so he takes me out for dinner and feeds me escargot .
snails !
anyway , the moment i go to bed with him , the asshole dumps me .
you dick sticking fuck !
you insult me byraisingyour voice .
i don't like being called dirty names .
don't do this to me .
where were you this afternoon?
you were on pike st. in hot pants .
i was on my way to work !
you haven't been to work in a week .
get your stuff .
i'm sorry .
i won't ever do that shit again .
i promise that .
you blew off your parole , you're going back .
it's that simple .
you dirty cocksucker !
you've got a dirty mouth , ruby .
i just want one chance !
god damn you , you motherfucker !
you mean fucker !
you send me back there and they'll kill me !
fucking asshole !
show's over .
go to sleep .
am i a mean son of a bitch?
she could get a second chance .
there are no second chances .
this is the last chance house .
what's wrong with that guy?
he used to be a college something .
a law teacher .
how can a law professor end here?
life's a bitch .
he got a dui and totalled his car .
he totalled his wife and daughter .
nobody got killed .
when his wife got done with him , he wished he had .
she took it all .
including the kid .
he hasn't seen his girl in years .
libby , it's wrong of you to be here .
i'm sorry , but you're my only hope .
sharon , put that down , please .
libby , i'm sorry , i can't .
i want to find my son .
mattys had six years with angie .
think about it .
six years .
benjamin , that's a great sandcastle .
if you come back into his life now , it'll cause more disruption and pain .
please , just think about it .
i just want to see him , rebecca .
can you give me angie's address so i can see him?
i really am sorry .
where's parsons?
i don't know .
not here .
i got her .
up here !
i got her !
there she is !
jesus christ , libby !
what are you doing here?
did you have a nice day at the beach?
you've pissed me off , parsons .
angela green .
the woman who's got your kid , right?
could we not talk , please , lehman?
all right .
why'd she skip town?
with your husband who isn't dead because you didn't kill him?
bullshit .
i chopped my husband into bits and dumped him in the pacific .
satisfied?
no !
you were a lot closer to your kid three days ago than you are today .
all you had to do was wait three years .
that's all .
you fucking idiot .
i sat in prison for six years and thought of nothing but my son .
did i make the right choice?
i didn't have one .
fuck your curfew !
who's that?
your daughter?
is that a problem for you , lehman?
i'm going up top .
don't go anywhere .
shit !
did you voluntarily give her a gun?
come on , what do you think?
were you drinking?
it's been known to happen .
any idea where she's gone?
well , that's about all then .
there will be an investigation into your actions today .
i wouldn't hold my breath about the prospect of keeping yourjob .
thanks a lot .
i sent your father off to the vfw .
he'll be playing gin for hours .
some things never change .
he's not as bad as he used to be .
i'm glad for you , momma .
i always said there was good money in tomatoes .
so , you're in the market for a bmw?
who isn't?
they're the best .
i decided it was time to trade up .
why don't you check my credit and see if i can finance this?
great , just give me your social security number .
20 oriole terrace , evergreen , colorado?
20 oriole terrace , evergreen , colorado , sure is .
you said green .
this says ryder .
no , i said ryder .
angela ryder .
what about the car?
fill this out and come back to me .
how's tricks , orbe?
no way , no way , no way .
i've been clean , mr travis .
i believe you .
i need a search on angela green .
i got her social security number .
i'm not allowed to give you that .
i shouldn't have asked you that .
does your employer know you used to perform fellatio for a living , and that you're out on parole?
you're required to tell him .
you're looking good , orbe .
i know .
honey , can you get that?
hi .
who is it , sam?
some lady .
may i help you?
isn't this angela ryder's address?
i've never heard of her , but we've just moved in .
check with the woman next door , she's been here 40 years .
excuse me .
whatever you're selling , i've got two .
i'm looking for my friend angela ryder .
she used to live next door .
i'm sorry to be the one to tell you , but angie died in the accident .
it was three or four years ago .
it was one of those awful things .
the gas stove was leaking .
the explosion knocked out some of my windows .
what about the boy?
matty?
he's such a dear child .
he and simon weren't there when it happened .
poor simon ...
i've never seen anyone so grief stricken .
help me out , kiddo .
it would really help if you could remember what kind of car she drove .
it was an old truck .
i don't know what year or make .
what colour was it?
kandinskys a bit out of our reach .
i have some picasso lithographs .
no , it's kandinsky i'm interested in .
particularly his blue rider period .
well , let's check art scan .
kandinskys don't become available too often , i'm afraid .
here's a lovely little miro ...
it really needs to be kandinsky .
ah , here is a lovely 1922 kandinsky lithograph ...
the 1911 is all that interests me .
1911 ...
stop !
there .
yes , that's it .
i'm afraid it was sold to a museum in munich six months ago .
can you find who sold it?
perhaps they have more .
yes , let's see .
if you'll excuse me a moment ...
yes sir , can i help you?
my name is travis lehman ...
she seemed so refined .
what did she want in your gallery?
can i help you?
is jonathan devereaux in?
no , but he'll be back for the party .
is matty here?
i don't believe i know you , ma'am .
maybe you'd like to leave a message?
it's a pleasure to have you with us , mrs kritch .
my suite has a view?
a lovely view of the mississippi .
and i need a masseur .
i'll send jerome right up .
bruce ... 1420 , mrs kritch .
hello .
are you lost?
no , actually i'm found .
i just had an hour with jerome .
oh ...
i've heard that he's marvelous .
he's fabulous .
i haven't felt this good since the day my husband died .
i've got something for tonight , but i think i need armani .
yes , very good , mrs ...?
kritch .
suite 1420 .
of course .
i'll be charging it to my room .
now , mrs kritch , i would say that you are a size four?
two .
of course .
there's a guy waiting for you .
did you catch that thing?
what did you use for bait?
i caught that big bucket mouth off an old lure my daddy left me .
of course , buzz bombs , poppers , jigs , lots of things work in these waters .
i'm jim mangold .
lehman , washington corrections .
what can i do for you?
who's this?
somebody i'm looking for .
pretty girl .
she's very pretty , for a convicted murderer .
she jumped parole on me .
i'd love to be able to help you ...
don't go to any trouble .
i came as a professional courtesy .
she's here to kill a prominent citizen .
how?
she'll probably use the . 38 special she stole from me .
roy lee !
get these in the works , now !
wherever did you find that wrap?
the first lady asked the same thing .
i wouldn't tell her , either .
invitations , sir?
good evening , ma'am .
good evening .
good evening .
we're delighted you're with us this evening on this very special occasion .
as is the custom in new orleans , since even before the war of northern aggression , we offer the ladies our first bachelor for the auctioning block .
our host , jonathan devereaux !
where is that man?
hey , jonathan .
thank you , louis .
you all having a good time?
before you is a moderately presentable man in his 30's , given to unhealthy thoughts and a dissipated lifestyle .
with , and this is what'll cost you the really big money ...
absolutely no redeeming moral virtues .
500 .
my cuff links cost more than that .
do i hear 1, 000?
thank you .
2, 000 .
did i hear the charming miss monroe?
i was starting to worry .
i thought maybe you didn't care .
2, 500 .
2, 500 .
we have a new bidder .
3, 000 .
5, 000 .
5, 500 .
we have 5, 500 .
will the lady take us to six?
$10, 000 .
at last , someone who knows my true value .
miss monroe , the bid is to you at $10, 500 .
he's yours .
i know he isn't worth that much , from personal experience .
thank you , honey .
all right , going once ... going twice ... sold !
the woman in the back . $10, 000 .
would you like to come forward and claim your prize?
hello , nick .
aren't you going to give me a kiss?
i think i've earned it .
i'll make this easy for you , nick .
an offer you can't refuse .
you used to love a good deal .
let's take this someplace private .
i remember what happened the last time we were alone .
i'm suzanne monroe .
i'm libby , i'm his wife .
well , jonathan !
a minute ago a bachelor , now you're married .
you don't waste any time .
you been in new orleans long?
i'm just picking up my child .
i'll be leaving soon .
we're putting the past behind us .
aren't we ...
jonathan?
but how long were you fucking angie before you decided to get rid of me?
would you excuse us , please?
sure , go ahead .
where is he , nick?
you destroyed my life , and i'll destroy yours , unless you give me matty .
that's all i want .
listen , let me explain something .
we were going to lose everything .
if i had guts , i'd have killed myself .
the insurance was to protect you .
so i'd be out of the picture , and you and matty would be okay .
i just never believed they would convict you .
they did , nick .
the thing with angie happened later .
it was a nightmare .
the worst part of it was being away from you .
is that why you killed her?
that was an accident .
sorry , i'm not buying .
it's bullshit .
i will swear on the life of our son ...
don't you fucking dare .
keep your hotel , your fancy accent and new name .
just give me matty .
i understand ...
now .
give him to me now !
i can't just leave here .
do you think i'm stupid?
i won't let you slip away again .
his school is far away .
be patient .
i've been patient for six years .
i want my child .
i'll call you tomorrow .
no screwing around .
excuse me .
where's mr devereaux?
he's at the bar , sir .
i'm sorry .
can i offer you a drink?
no , thank you .
let me guess .
scotch and soda?
i'll have a diet coke , please .
you're on the wagon . $10 says i'm right .
you've never seen her before?
i'm positive .
she believes i'm her husband , whom she killed?
that's pretty far fetched .
she has a gun and she's after you .
thank you .
i'll alert our security .
you do that .
the cops have been passing these out .
no reward .
screw 'em .
they'll be in every hotel in town .
so much for a good night's sleep .
take this and get out of here .
thanks a lot .
let's go , lehman .
we spotted your girl .
where's the girl , dilbert?
what do you think you're doing?
i thought you were somebody else .
have a good evening .
i take it that ain't her?
mr lehman ... come in .
may i offer you a cuban cigar?
no , thanks .
as you can see , i'm alive and kicking .
what can i do for you?
we spotted the parsons woman .
she got away .
i came by to find out if you'd heard from her .
not a peep .
any idea why she's fixated on you?
the world's full of crazy people , am i right?
truer words were never spoken .
those are nice pictures .
did your kids do them?
no ...
those pictures are by a very great artist named kandinsky .
but why do i think you already knew that?
excuse me for a second .
this is a business call .
oh , i'm sorry .
that back door leads to the kitchen .
have the chef fix you a new orleans breakfast .
the eggs st. jacques .
i have your card .
good morning .
i hope you had a nice night .
i want you to bring matty to lafayette cemetery number three .
that's an odd choice for a reunion .
it's a big tourist place .
a lot of people around .
you're a smart girl .
i can have him there by four .
where's matty?
relax .
he's nervous .
i told him he could go play inside .
there he is .
matty , come over here , son .
i'll get him for you .
no .
it's something i want to do .
matty?
matty?
hey , kiddo ...
hey , matty ...
matty ...
matty , it's mommy .
you have to learn to relax .
why are your panties in such a twist?
you ever arrest anybody you thought was innocent?
nope .
there's no information on devereaux that's over three years old .
so he changed his name .
lots of folks do .
it don't make them criminals .
but i'm betting he's nick parsons .
but you can't prove it .
hey , is that long distance?
bill me .
lucy , this is travis .
get the dmv to fax me a washington driver's licence .
nicholas parsons .
i'm at the new orleans police station .
you better talk to mr carruthers .
his colon is twisted in a knot .
give me that .
i've had to cover your office .
i think parsons was telling the truth .
you're not a lawprofessornow .
you're barely a parole officer .
stop playing mission lmpossible .
all i need is a photograph of nicholas parsons .
come back today , because tomorrow you go before the commissioner .
karl , i know i'm right .
give me a chance , okay?
i'm asking you politely .
you send me that goddamn picture !
it's not him .
sometimes we all want to believe .
we forget that 99 . 9 % of the time , life just flat don't work out .
thanks , i feel a lot better now .
any time .
hold it right here .
it's over , libby .
oh , travis ...
messages .
mr devereaux?
mr lehman ...
this is really not a good time .
i understand .
a lot of people feel that way about me , but i have good news .
won't take long .
well?
it turns out i owe you an apology .
after our last conversation , i thought she was telling the truth about you .
so i asked the washington state dmv to send me a driver's licence photograph of nicholas parsons .
and?
and this is what came up .
well , we all make mistakes .
there's no harm done .
then it occurred to me what a common name nicholas parsons is .
it turns out there were six .
and this ... ... is number three .
i never liked that picture .
so you came here to make a deal .
otherwise you'd have gone to the police .
what's your price?
a million dollars .
it's a nice , round figure .
all right .
but i need a few days .
no .
one million dollars right now .
it's nine o'clock at night .
i can't just ...
wait a minute .
wait !
i have $100, 000 in the safe here .
you can have that now .
i'll get you the rest tomorrow .
you got a deal .
mrs parsons can still make a lot of trouble for us , even from prison .
i don't need that .
i think i've solved that problem .
let's just say the problem has been buried .
she's gone , i promise you .
you're not very good at keeping promises .
you going to do something?
me?
she's the one with the gun .
they're tough in louisiana .
shoot me , and they'll give you the gas chamber .
no , they won't .
it's called double jeopardy .
i can shoot you in the middle of mardis gras and they can't touch me .
as an ex law professor , i can assure you she's right .
where's my son?
in st alban's school , in georgia .
you have your son back , you got what you want .
i haven't felt that good in six years .
i want you to suffer like i suffered .
what she means is , you're going to prison .
for murder .
who did i supposedly murder?
me .
all you have is an old fax photo .
the motive .
your wife , whom you had framed , tracks you down , so you kill her .
you won't get away with it .
i think i've solved thatproblem .
let'sjustsay the problem has been buried .
she's gone , lpromise you .
taped confessions are very persuasive in court .
plus the physical evidence we'll put in the car .
shovel , hair , my fingerprints , blood .
and gasoline .
it'll look like you burned and buried me , just like you said on the tape .
the prosecution rests .
you better get out of here .
you can't be around if the police are arresting a guy for your murder .
wait a minute .
i'll take that gun .
well , lehman , you gonna live?
i doubt it .
since you're still legally his wife , you inherited a fine little hotel here .
not interested .
i guess i'm gonna take off now .
no , you're not .
you're a parole violator .
you're going back with me to seattle , where i'll demand a full pardon , and a parade , and a little pink poodle , on a key chain .
what are you waiting for?
go on .
i don't know if i've ever been so scared in my whole life .
i think a big part of me never thought i'd really find him .
what if he doesn't recognise me?
maybe after all this time ...
because of you i have lost a good used car and a not so good job .
if you don't go to him right now , i'll have you arrested ... for stupidity .
go on .
thanks , lehman .
you saved my life .
you saved mine , too .
coach matthews .
how you doing?
nice to meet you .
it'll be half time soon .
matty ...
matty .
hi .
do you know who i am?
they told me you were dead .
no , sweetheart .
