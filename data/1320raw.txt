angela , all god`s children deserve a chance .
her dumb ass deserves the boot !
ok , that`s not nice . ``not nice``?

l`m gonna tell you what`s not nice .
it`s malcolm king forcing me to hire another one ... of his incompetent little hoochies as my assistant .
i know .
i can`t stand malcolm king ... and king enterprises .
but if i wasn`t a lock for that v. p. position ...
i would be out of here so fast .
oh , i know .
i deserve the promotion anyway .
l`ve been doing the damn job for the past few months .
l`ve got a master`s degree from yale .
yale .
and 10 years of experience .
i just got the car of my dreams ...
i closed escrow on a pretty three bedroom .

and l`m going to show you ...
make yourself useful .

i thought you were still in prison for armed robbery .
yeah , well , i was until i broke out this morning .
ahh !
ahh !
hey !

i need you to get me money .
enough to buy me a mexican vacation .
i don`t have any money , raven .
i know that , loser .
i got a plan , and i need your help .
well , whatever your plan is , i don`t want any part of it .
shut up .
you`re gonna do exactly what i tell you to do .
you been hearing about this little boy who got kidnapped?
yeah .
well , that`s the plan .
you`re gonna help me kidnap some ...
no , no , l`m not kidnapping anybody .
then you better figure out a way to turn no dollars into $10, 000 .
l ... $10, 000?
there`s no way i can do that .
look , if i get caught again , you`re going down with me ... and we both know you won`t last one second in prison .
raven ...
ten grand , corey .
l`il be in touch .
give me malcolm .
hold on .
the bitch is on line one .
damn it !
ok .
you want me to stop?
oh , no , baby , keep going .
uh , renee , what`s up?
what do you want?
miss gladys?
miss gladys , there is nobody on line one !
i think i accidentally hung up on her .
mmm !
oh , get back to work , baby .
mmm !
hot damn !
whoo !
malcolm king`s office .
you hung up on me , you old witch .
call me that again , and i will snatch ... every bit of fake hair out of your nappy head .
just do your job and get malcolm .
gold digger .
hold on !
oh !
she`s on line one .
what do you want , renee?
ah , there you are .
must you cancel all of my credit cards?
what am i supposed to do for money?
hell if i care .
ha ha ha ha ha !
that sounds embarrassing .
where were you when they canceled ... all of your credit cards?
ha ha ha ha ha !
ha ha ha .
laugh all you want to now ... but we`il see who`s laughing after the divorce ... because my lawyer assured me that i will be getting ... a very lucrative divorce settlement ... very lucrative .
at least half , maybe more .
and just like sex with you after two minutes ... this conversation is over .
ah !
uh oh .
i know he`s gonna try something slick ... to get out of paying me .
don`t you have some work to do?
l`m ... finished with the pool .
i wasn`t talking about ... the pool .
you must think that i have very poor eyesight , counselor .
your list of marital assets has several glaring omissions ... most notably , king enterprises .
and its holdings .
for the one hundredth time , anita ...
king enterprises limited ... is the sole ownership of malcolm king ... and i will not ... we will not stand by ... and watch it be broken up out of spite .
your food`s here .
oh , thank you .
oh , let me guess ...
kung pao chicken without vegetables ... not too spicy , all white meat ... with extra fortune cookies .
he gets the same thing all of the time .
bo ... ring .
can we offer you ladies anything?
no , thank you .
l`m not hungry .
oh , hell .
why don`t i just take half of malcolm`s food anyway?
note that .
look , counselor , renee has been with malcolm ... since the very beginning of king enterprises ... and deserves a half a share of the company .
what?
hell , i deserve all of it .
you said so yourself .
when?
find that little thing .
please .
ah , here is it . ``my dearest renee ... ``everything i have built , i built for you . ``love always , malcolm . ``
ooh .
poetry .
it`s a greeting card , man .
i was drunk when i wrote it ... and she was butt naked on the floor .
what?
we are seeking the primary residence ... as well as one of the vacation homes .
l`ve already gone ahead and had the lake house appraised .
the details are inside .
now , as far as preliminary meetings go ... it wasn`t so bad .
i need that money , anita .
this hair does not grow on trees .
hello?
hi .
hi , mrs. king .
looks like we`re gonna have to do this the hard way .
you know , l`m just gonna call you renee .
no , you won`t .
what?
well , this is disastrous .
what`s wrong?
another divorce case that l`ve been working on for months ... but my client neglected to tell me ... that she has been having an affair .
mm hmm .
and guess what?
the judge found out .
i sure hope the sex was worth it ... because she just cost herself millions .
ooh .
so , you just gonna let them waltz outta here like that , huh?
i can`t make them take our offer , malcolm .
listen ... listen to me .
there is a very real chance ...
renee could walk out of this with half of king enterprises .
that ... that valentine was brilliant , man .
david .
david !
i will handle it myself .
malcolm , i know that look .
i know that ...
do not do anything crazy .
do not .
thanks for nothing , david .
see yourself out .
malcolm .
malcolm .
malcolm !
ok , let me rock you steady , ma
dollars don`t fall , man , it`s not confetti
this ain`t a punchline , battle rhyme , lunch line
this is just to get you twistin` up your body one time
if not one time , do it two
one , two , three , shoot .
sorry .
oh .
oh , thank you .
andre , right?
yeah .
oh , good .
i need to ask you a favor .
whassup , whassup , whassup?
oh , well , oh ...
i was hoping you could wax this real good for me ... and try not to leave any scratches .
hey , well , you know , whatever you`re into , baby .
so , you`re gonna hook me up?
hell , yes .
oh !
ha ha ha !
you`re so sweet .
um , l`il call and set up a time with you later .
and don`t worry .
l`il definitely make it worth your while .
oh .

good morning , miss gladys .
good morning .
oh , you made the front page .

mm hmm .
that little punk .
he told me this wasn`t supposed to run ... until a week from sunday .
this is just gonna give renee more ammo ... and my black ass is the target .
malcolm king .

and it is .
but there are also times ... when l`m forced to make the tough calls ... times like these .
you`re firing me?
yeah , l`m firing you .
you see , your energy level is just not where it used to be ... and as the team leader ...
i need everyone to be really into their jobs .

malcolm king can`t talk .
we`il tie him up .
we`il tie his hands , we`il tie his feet ... and we`il jiggle him .

oh , and then l`m grabbed outside the benefit at 11 : 00 .
look , you see that?
boom , right?
and then l`m taken to the secret location .
now , just to throw people off ... a ransom note will be sent to my gold digging wife ... demanding $10 million for my safe return .
uh huh .
and it`s gonna contain all the usual stuff .
you know , don`t contact the police ... or the media ... blah , blah , blah ... because if you do , we`re gonna kill him .
hmm .
yes .
now look at renee .
when she hears this ... she probably gonna start celebrating .
then she`il remember that i cut her out of my will .

and then it sinks in .
no malcolm , no money .
ha ha !
wow .

you`re running out of time .
damn .
all right .
i guess i got the right one .
billionaire andrew ross ... is in critical condition after his hot air balloon ... plummeted to the ground in the jungles of africa .
he was then attacked by a wild rhinoceros .
white folks .

it`s no biggie , really .
you know what?
you ain`t got no balls .
you see me?
i don`t take nothin` from nobody .
you want to know why? `cause i got big balls .
i got big manly balls .
big manly , hairy , shark infested swimmin` ...
my balls are so ...
they hang to the back of my knee ... when i wear shorts .
and you know what?
i ain`t afraid to let `em hang for nobody .
it must be hard for you to buy underpants .
ha ha ha ha !

we don`t need you ...
i don`t give a damn about official police business .
malcolm king is my business .
l`m gonna leave now , not because you told me to ... but because if i don`t leave now ...
i won`t be able to get my numbers in .
but l`il be back .
and until you find him ...
l`m gonna stay on y`all like white girls on nba players .
who is it?
it`s us ...
brooke and kim .
hi !
come in .
the door`s open .
what took you guys so long?
huh?
the police were here .
they were asking questions about mr. king .
you guys , i think we should go to the police ... and tell them everything that we know .
i mean , it`s not like we actually kidnapped anybody .
yes , we did .
well , mostly we didn`t .
that`s a great idea , kim .
unbelievable !
i believe the charge is conspiracy to kidnapping .
ok?
yeah .
i learned a thing or two about the criminal code ... when i was at cornell .
cornell?
cornell?
i thought you said you went to ...
didn`t she go to harvard?
right , but she did ...
no , it was ...
undergrad at yale .
and then when she went to princeton , she was ...
no , it was harvard , and then she went ...
where`d she do her doctorate?
i lied !
what?
i went to devry institute .
ooh .
ooh .
and i didn`t finish .
and for whatever reason , the king enterprises ... didn`t check that pack of lies i called a rsum .
oh , my god .
look , i got a g. e. d.
ohh !
ohh !
and an lvy league mortgage payment .
so that makes me one desperate , dangerous woman .
so until this thing blows over ...
