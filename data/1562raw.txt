police raid !
after the war , tokyo was a jungle
the weak went to the wall
every day was a fight for life
kill or be killed
watch out !
there's a body coming through !
mr abe ...
what?
starved to death?
yup .
times are tough
a drink for luck !
two , since morning
the japanese have really lost heart
well , keep eating my sweet potatoes and you won't go hungry !
and that's the truth , not the lies they told you in the army !
these are kintoki brand from saitama
eat all you want , little sister !
hey !
stop her !
you really that hungry?
eat all you want 100 yen .
you buy?
ok?
she's pretty , no?
very , very pretty .
you buy?
come back !
i'm from yoshino gang
i can sort this out
if i do ... ... can i have a fuck?
all right
move !
out of the way !
excuse me !
know where i can find work?
ever been with a man?
who's she?
wants to join us
your name?
it's maya
i'm miyo
i'm o roku the idiot ...
at your service , madam !
it's hard work at first
watch us and learn
find a man and sell yourself
it's as simple as that
and there's no pimps to take your money afterwards
you know those signs you see on fish shops? ...
direct from seller to buyer " it's the best way ...
makes sense
and remember nobody'll protect you but us
don't forget that .
ok?
and obey our rules
like from yuraku cho to kachidoki bridge ...
if you see a new girl , tell us ...
that's our territory !
it's self protection
it's our right !
the yoshino gang help us out with things like that ...
come over here
intruder !
another thing we never do is give it for free .
understand?
selling our bodies is our business
bad for business to give it away
we'll hurt you if you do
torture you till you're half dead !
get me?
hold on !
wait till i undress
go on .
i'll watch .
it il wake me up
you come in without being asked then leave ... ... without a goodbye?
let me go !
leave your stuff and i will !
not even enough dough to pay her !
arsehole !
hang on !
you made me lose business !
okay?
that's for your trouble
fine
where you back from?
pacific?
north
your boyfriend go south?
my brother
he was in borneo
a brother , huh?
hey , you want business?
i'm no cradle snatcher ... !
bastard !
they're eager !
got to eat properly once in a while , huh?
o sen , how about that fuck?
all right , but no discount
what?
going to charge me?
of course
is it?
it sure isn't
o fuku broke our rule
went with a student ... ... who was selling raffle tickets under the bridge
she did it for free
i feel sorry for her
sorry?
why?
her hair ...
cutting off all her hair ...
you're getting soft ...
eh?
o machi? !
that o machi is such a bitch !
thinks she's better than us
makes me sick
she came about a month before you
you want it?
i saw her trying to pull a customer so i scared her off
then she started to cry ... ... and , like a fool , ... ...
i fell for her sob story
but i hate her .
she's so stuck up ...
must you go now?
early start tomorrow morning
your wife's lucky
going all the way to fukushima to see her
have to .
her father would bawl me out ...
a kept man ...
it's nice to be a wife
i wish i was one ...
your husband was a teacher?
yes .
on the reserve list but sent to iwojima
i sometimes wonder ... ... how he died
it was awful !
that last guy really stank !
now i feel like i do !
smell , o roku
no thank you !
wash well , maya .
disease and babies are our enemies !
don't remind me !
my mother ... ... she drowned in the river
with my little brother
at daichi .
he was only 7 years old
where were you?
i was working at the factory
everyone who jumped into the river or got on boats died
a sumo man died hanging onto the side of the boat
his wrists above the water were burned all black
that's enough !
we're all victims of the war !
that's what we call ... ...
persecution complex !
if my brother hadn't died in borneo ...
here we go again maya and borneo
let's call her borneo maya
that's not a bad name ...
o roku , what was that thing you used to say?
my curse?
to spit in the eye of the world and his wife !
stuff them !
a curse?
yes , a curse !
curse everything !
waifs , tramps , babies , workers , wives ...
parents , grown ups ...
buildings , trains , trucks ...
realizing nobody would help us ... ... made us know what to expect
in order to survive , we stuck close together
it was the will to live ... ... that kept us going
listen , bitch , don't push me too far !
this is our territory !
territory !?
that's what made us lose the war !
we're a democracy now !
democracy means fucking foreigners ...?
i don't think so !
there's a difference between democracy and collaboration
hey , come on !
come on !
look here , o sen !
you'll get us into trouble if you fight here
so what?
why should we care?
you men are soft !
like these stupid whores !
what's that?
you heard me !
i'll show you who i am !
llon heart
you've a nice body
you'd look good tattooed all over
i once saw a geisha with a spider tattooed on her thigh
stood out in relief ... ... whenever she drank or got excited
that tattoo made me want to take up this work
power !
that's what i want !
a power that'll make me invincible !
i know ...
like those people way back ... ... who got tattooed to fight wild beasts
what's up?
an ex soldier stabbed a gl !
scared the shit out of me , i can tell you !
a fight?
it was so quick .
i don't know ...
seems the japanese spirit lives on !
why don't you show some then?
it's not so easy now .
democracy .
everything's democracy
over here , maya !
no business?
i hate it when it's slow like this
a bowl of noodles
women should be wives , don't you think?
i remember my own childhood
my parents loved each other and it was a peaceful home
then father strayed and left home
but he came back
it wasn't because of me
but father couldn't forget her
he couldn't forget her body
you don't know what happens ... ... do you , little maya?
when a man and a woman ... ... have passed ... ... through the gate of flesh
you don't know the secrets of the flesh , do you little maya?
don't call me little maya !
maya's enough !
feeling lonely?
come on , let's go
got the money?
don't worry !
let's get it over with
it's hot
japanese women are such sluts now !
so?
you men are to blame !
you lost the war !
what?
want to fuck me or not?
eh?
money first !
later , baby ...
he's gone
there he goes !
come on !
he escape ... !
he escape ... !
o machi's acting strange
never here these days
seems restless when she does come back
not her usual self
maya , what do you think?
well ...
she said she hated the work
she can quit any time !
same as us and acting the lady !
her regular .
he had to move out to the country
what's that ...?
someone get me some sake !
you're hurt?
a scratch .
the cops are after me
you're safe here .
maya go buy some
we meet again
you stabbed that gi in the market?
i had my reasons
not found him yet?
it hurts?
'course not !
good as new in 20 days
we're made that way
you're a lucky man
the rain's washed the blood away
the cops have lost the trail
you can rest up here !
can t he , sen?
what's your name?
ibuki shintaro , a former corporal !
unemployed !
this place is just like a field hospital ...
your work's nobi?
katsuage?
haikuru , i reckon
what you talking about?
you don't know?
our words for housebreaking , blackmail or thief ...
idiots !
talking tough ...
and you're only kids !
acting like grown ups
makes me laugh !
you know nothing of life !
you're a burglar !
that's the coolest !
i'm tired
this is our place !
i'll decide who goes !
just eats , so he has enough strength to fight
i respected him
in primitive life , the strongest becomes leader
soon ibuki became the centre of our lives
say , is that rice ready?
i lived through all the horrors of war !
you lot think this is hard .
that's a laugh !
you're having a whale of a time , enjoying life !
can t tell who's the parasite now
he's wild been cooped up too long .
right?
be quiet !
i'm off !
before we're shouted at again ...
be a good boy !
look after the house for us
still here?
get to work !
here ...
this is for you
you like pineapples?
sure glad to have these in the north china mountains
nothing tasted better
promised i'd stuff myself on them one day
you like a treat?
sure .
what's life besides food and sex?
the noblest words mean nothing without them
yes , that's why we lost the war
but the big shots still talk big !
i'll never trust them again !
now i live for food and sex !
shin's touchy , but a real man
laughs like a little boy
just like my brother
be great if he stays with us
got any canned stuff?
pineapples?
american
yes , how much 20 yen
don't get caught
hey you !
you scared me !
sorry .
i want to talk to her
have you seen him again?
who?
the guy who stabbed the gl?
you were with him when the mp's came ...
haven't seen him .
don't know him
listen , sen ...
help me
he scares me .
he's got guts
he stole a load of stuff from yokohama px warehouse
got some buddies and a gi to help him
must have been that gi he stabbed
guess they quarrelled
and if i find him?
i just want to talk to him
do a deal with him
you want the stuff
we'll pay , of course it il be a good deal
if i see him , i'll tell him
you do that
you got some too?
it's not pineapples !
say , sweetie ...
what's that?
pineapples
pineapples !!
quick !
it's pineapples !!!?
excuse me ... ... but who are you?
i'm staying here
you one of them?
yes
you're different
oh ...
hello
i can't stay ...
say hello to the others for me
she makes me sick !
with ibuki around ... ... someone's bound to break the rule
that's going to cause problems
it's time to remind ourselves ... ... how horrible the punishment can be
o machi went and did it , sen
she broke our rule
she did it for free !
i never trusted her .
i knew she'd betray us !
can we punish her , sen?
yes , if there's proof !
we'll do it !
there's proof all right .
last night , in the hotel ...
here , this is for you
no , please
i don't want your money
but that's ...
when we're together , i pretend i'm your wife
when i'm with other men ... ...
i think only that i will soon be with you
then i feel better
what's going on?
just wait and see
what is it?
you'll soon find out
hide !
are you alone?
what's up?
o machi !
take off your clothes !
we'll punish you !
what?
i didn't ... !
shut up !
strip , or it'll hurt !
o roku heard it all !
that's right !
now get them off !
god !
she's well stacked !
dirty slut !
i don't even care if i kill her !
on her backside !
sounds better !
come on !
you've never loved a man !
you're jealous ... ...
because i know the secrets of the flesh !
see , o machi !
we sell ourselves for money !
doing it for free !
you're a traitor !
it's still not enough
i've got it !
wait !
i'll show you
what'll you do?
just guess
what a great idea !
now she won't flaunt her body !
stand up machiko
careful or you'll get hurt
what're you going to do?
if i die , i'll come back !
i'll haunt you !
haunt us?
you don't scare us ...
alright .
stop this nonsense and let her go
she's had enough
this american stew's good !
and cheap too
what you smiling at?
you remind me of someone
when i went to grade school ... ... my third year ... ... a boy played a red demon in a play
a cooper's son
dark skinned boy
he looked cute ... ... in the red paper demon's mask
so i'm like a red demon?
not really ...
more like my brother
the hero was a sumo wrestler's son
really stuck up .
i hated him
the red demon was bad ... ... but i felt i would like to be eaten by him
you fancied him?
guess so
after he moved away , i couldn't eat for a week
how old are you?
a wounded beast wants to return to his wild life when he's well
ibuki went out from time to time
when you didn't come , i thought you'd left tokyo
i almost did
look after my gear for me
i'll come back for it
what is it?
not hot gear?
'course not .
i wouldn't put a friend's father in danger
don't do anything too silly
you survived , remember
maybe you think it wasn't worth it
but still ... ... just think of those who didn't make it
the problem's money .
you can't do anything without it
shin , you know you can't go on like this ...
you might get caught
i'll be gone before then
that's not what i meant !
if you want money now , how about that yoshino deal?
the occupation stuff !
you hid it?
why not?
ah , yes ! ...
the deal ...
don't do it !
you're better off as a thief .
it's safer !
mr ishii the boss !
pleased to meet you
i hear you got some ... ... hot stuff?
penicillin .
only 200 left .
you want it?
can you guarantee it's ... ... not fake?
if you don't want it , others will
these amateurs are touchy !
all right ...
pay him now
i'll keep some ...
for my clothes
want a receipt?
don't be stupid
if you cheat us , we'll find you
where's the stuff?
when can you get it?
out past matsudo
day after tomorrow , same time?
ok !
so what do you say?
could you really take a woman like me ... ... as a wife?
you ask that now?
but it seems like a dream
my father in law's slave at 40 .
i'm ashamed
i want to be independent .
start again ; you and me , huh?
wonderful
you're really sweet , you know?
i'm so happy
having fun?
it's not like that
how are the girls?
those pests?
who cares !
eating , sleeping in the dark !
they're filth
aren't you ... ... on their side?
you joking?
i hate them !
i get sick watching them act big !
i could kill them !
listen ... ... are you free tonight?
all right
wherever you want
you don't know how i feel
machiko's a witch , making shin her slave !
i'll become a witch too !
it's strange ...
what?
for so long i've dreamed ... ... of just being a wife again
why do i hesitate ... ... now i have the chance to be one?
somehow , i don't know ...
it just doesn't seem important now
you just have to go the whole way
no use thinking and wavering
japan must go all the way too
if she sinks , suffers , and starts over ... ... she'll find a way to survive
who are you saying this for?
me ...
or yourself?
i'm just saying rely on your own instincts
listen , want to live with me?
be serious !
it was just a bit of fun
so , shin still hasn't come back
he's never coming back !
o machi did it out of spite
his fault too !
o roku , shin's not to blame !
it's shin !
what you gonna do with that?
eat it !
i was a butcher in the army
you lot need feeding up
how'll we eat it?
kill it , of course
kill it? !!
that took time
o miyo you go shikiten
give me a smoke
shikiten?
keep watch
wipe yourself
what's up?
my cow's gone
what?
cow?
gone
it's not here ...
stinks !
what's up?
ibuki was here yesterday
o roku !
go now ...
now they want to close the market
is there any way ...?
any way what?
i have a problem ...
it was all my idea
i can't cause the gang trouble
what're you trying to say?
come on !
can the deal be dropped?
will he give back the money?
what?
don't talk like a kid !
silly boy !
it may be wood alcohol , but don't be scared !
i'll drink it !
don't blame me if you die
i'll haunt you if i do !
well , i drank the most of it !
so i'll be dead too !
i don't mind dying !
me neither !
meat costs 40 yen per pound?
so do we .
same price !
it's true
human flesh same price as meat !
that's funny !
don't you think so?
eat 40 yen meat , sell ourselves for 40 yen what's the diff?
do we eat to sell or sell to eat?
so what are we living for?
search me
stop this crap !
we're alive , and we're eating ...
what more could we want?
nothing !
watching you getting that cow down those narrow steps
amazing !
in the army i used to take donkeys over cliff roads , down ravines
i'm an expert donkey trainer
must have been really tough ...
what would you know !
i don't want your sympathy !
oongratulatlons on your oall up
good luok on the way
my brother took this with him
any donkeys in borneo?
in borneo?
i don't know
your brother died there?
congratulations on your call up
seems so sad ...
they all marched off to die
look lively , girls !
i'll show you " the heroic landing " !
brother ...
suicide?
so they say ...
look at you useless lot !
shin ...
have a drink with me !
can t take any more
did you really sleep with o machi?
yeah .
so what?
what a fool !
with that slut ...
she's no slut .
she's a real woman
i'm a real woman too !
aren't i , shin !
aren't i? ...
stay what you are .
a tough , tattooed girl ...
oh , shin ...
now go away !
i'm sleepy
you slob !
useless filthy crook !
get the fuck out of here !
stop it !
what do you want?
to kill you and die !
please ...
take me now
i love you !
i love you !
where you going?
to sell the meat
we can't eat it all
i heard sen last night ... ... told you to get out
what you going to do?
it's time to go , anyway
shin !
explain something for me ...
for the first time i love a man , but i'll be thrown out
the instant i become a woman ... ...
i'm rejected
i'm cursed ...
i'll starve to death
being a woman means i can't live here
i'm an outcast
this is too deep for me !
listen ...
want to get the hell out of here?
meet me at hinode bridge at 9 ,
gotta clear up some business
i'll be there
i promise
understand?
o roku , you tell mr abe
shin made us do it !
got to show him !
he mustn t think we're in it with him
let's give o machi's treatment to maya !
him and maya , both just as bad !
you're joking ! ...
aren't you?
why would i lie !
hurry !
he'll skip with the penicillin !
quick !
somebody tell mr ishii !
have him call the mp's !
damned ibuki !
i wasn't happy keeping it for you
afraid it might get lost
i wish it had
what is it?
a friend's .
all that's left of him now
be a shame to burn it
keep it to remind you
sorry i came so early
take care now
going?
all right ...
you take care , too
be sure to write
marry a nice girl and settle down
wait
for luck
one !
two !
three !
pull !!
shin ...
come on !
quickly !
pull him out !
shit !
this isn't penicillin !
i'm an outcast
and i'll live my life as an outcast
even if it takes me straight to hell !
the end
