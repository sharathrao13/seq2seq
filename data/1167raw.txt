you know , you ever heard someone say that old expression ,
'everything happens for a reason '?
well , i don't think that applies to me .
i mean , i spend every morning rushing to work trying to catch the same subway to the same lousy job .
what's the reason for that?
see , i'm a researcher for one of the biggest publishing houses in chicago , but where i really belong is in creative .
the problem is , is my boss doesn't know it yet , so i'm totally frustrated .
while my friend paul keeps telling me ,
'you gotta be optimistic .
you gotta be positive . '
ok .
ok .
you know what?
today is gonna be my lucky day .
today is gonna be my ...
hey , look at that .
it's your lucky day .
did you just see that?
oh , i've seen it a million times .
you want it?
no .
i don't want it .
go ahead .
you got a new briefcase .
yeah , maybe its got a name on it or something .
oh , come ...
what are you , nuts?
what?
you're gonna return it?
yeah .
did you not just say you needed a new one?
yeah , when i get my raise .
haven't you been working there for , like , a year?
i bet taylor doesn't even know you work there .
i'd be pissed .
are you pissed?
i'd be pissed .
yeah , i'm i'm a little pissed .
you know , come to think of it , i've never really seen you angry before .
henderson , you ever seen tom really angry?
no .
all right , fine .
so i don't get angry .
what is that , a bad thing?
it's , you know , you keep it bottled up and then sooner or later , you come into work and you mow everyone down with one of those ...
ak 47 .
ak 47 .
you know , just to impress , uh ...
jodie foster .
jodie foster .
all right .
i'll do it on your day off , all right?
touch .
there she is .
it's your jodie foster .
paul , come on , man .
how you ever gonna get to know her if you just sit there?
it's taylor's daughter , man .
i can't just ...
you can't just what?
huh?
are you gonna be a loser your whole life?
hmm?
just go over there and talk to her .
go .
go .
ok , fine .
i'm going .
i'm going .
you're going .
excuse me .
hi .
i'm ...
i ...
oh !
uh ...
i ...
he wa ...
what are you doing to my dog?
ma'am ...
who's taunting my dog?
no one's taunting your dog .
he ...
um , the the d ...
um ...
here , why don't you take my seat?
here .
great .
now , that's great .
two more minutes , and i'm gonna be closer than you are .
look .
opening .
go .
just go .
go .
go .
it's ok .
go , just go .
lake street .
lake street is next .
you're tom stansfield , right?
from research?
yeah .
yeah .
tom .
tom stansfield .
stansfield from research .
it's a growing sport , you know?
paul , there is no way that she thought that it was a wrestling magazine .
oh , come on .
get over it , ok?
you're a little embarrassed .
it happens , ok?
let me tell you something .
if i had a dime for every time a gay naked magazine fell out of my ...
i'm kidding .
i'm kidding .
what?
paul !
no .
but seriously , so you're a little humiliated .
at least now we've established that she knows who you are , right?
i'm gonna have to leave the company .
no , you're not .
oh , god .
there she is .
oh , and i need to see the proofs on thailand immediately .
all right .
what else have we got?
are you tom?
yes .
mr. taylor wants to see you .
oh ...
ok .
ok .
ok , you see?
this is your chance .
this is fate .
this is what i'm talking about .
it's about that new opening in creative and you're the man for the job .
you're gonna go in there and you're gonna pitch him those book ideas .
no , i just ...
i'm really not ready .
let's get to business .
now we're steppin 'up .
ok .
come on .
you're gonna go in there , you're gonna pitch him an inside curve ...
wait , wait .
where is my blue folder?
you don't need it .
enough with the excuses already .
come here .
you look good .
you feel good?
i feel like i'm gonna throw up .
well , that's good .
i want you to use that , ok?
what is this?
this dad's?
it's nice .
now get in there , ok?
don't don't touch my ass .
what?
it was a light spank .
it was light .
hey .
hey .
uh , do i just go in there?
um , no .
he's not finished yet , but you can have a seat over there .
oh , ok .
let me explain something to you , henderson .
i did not dislike your ideas .
i found them loathsome .
i hated them .
you're dismissed .
from your office?
nice try .
good luck .
you're gonna need it ...
he's ready to see you .
you can come in .
you know what?
we should have never let up after the revolution !
sit down .
sit down .
coffee?
we shouldn't have left you at toehold .
we should have driven you to the sea !
now ... what's this i hear about you making threats to spray this place with an ak 47?
what?
oh , oh , oh .
no .
that ...
i was just making a joke .
oh , that's funny to you?
killing everyone in this office?
no .
no .
no , no , no , no .
the ...
paul said how i never get angry ...
and what about you making fun of midgets?
i never made fun of midgets .
you said it'd be fun to date one because then you could rest your beer on her head .
no .
no , i never said anything like that .
apparently henderson thinks you did .
now i've got a good sense of humor , but that's just plain sick .
but , sir , i didn't say ...
audrey?
which file did i ask you for?
uh , the platt file?
john platt .
not sam platt .
i'm sorry .
i guess i didn't think that ...
that's right .
you didn't think .
now if it's not too much trouble , if you could fetch me the right file ...
ok .
and get tom and me some doughnuts .
now ...
i'm told you've been trying to schedule a meeting with me about some ideas .
what are they?
oh , uh ... yeah .
i had i had some ideas .
something wrong with the coffee?
uh , no .
it's fine .
why'd you make a face?
what?
oh , well ...
it's it's a little bitter , but ...
jesus .
audrey , get in here !
sir , really , it's f ...
it's not a problem .
i've burped up stuff better than this .
sir , it's fine .
is something wrong?
taste tom's coffee .
no , really .
it's ok .
how would you rate that?
well , it's not that great .
not that great?
i guess so .
tom thinks it's shit .
audrey , are you retarded?
it's not a rhetorical question .
are you retarded?
no , i'm not retarded .
because a retarded person can make a cup of coffee .
am i right , tom?
oh , i ...
i don't i don't really know much about the limitations of the handicapped .
i know of an employment agency that hires out retarded people for $4 an hour .
so , if making a cup of coffee is too difficult a task for you , miss bennett , perhaps you'd be good enough to let me know , and i'll contact this agency and give a retarded person a job .
i wasn't too rough on her , was i?
well , she is new and all .
maybe i was out of line .
but do you understand what i'm dealing with?
i mean , here i am trying to fill a position in creative , and i can't seem to find one person responsible enough to earn my trust .
i sometimes wonder if anyone here even knows what they're doing .
i can understand how you could see it that way , sir , but ...
so you don't think i was out of line?
well , if what you're saying is that a company is only as strong as its weakest link , that makes sense , but ...
exactly .
that's exactly right .
a company is only as strong as its weakest link .
yeah ...
audrey , get in here !
you were right , tom .
i was too soft on her .
what?
no .
yeah?
audrey , after talking it over with tom here ,
i've come to realize that i'm gonna have to let you go .
you're firing me? !
i'm sorry .
it's just not working out .
but , sir , i was suggesting ...
i take my job very seriously .
a chain is only as strong as its weakest link .
right , but there's a whole other side .
thanks for the support .
audrey , empty out your desk by the end of the day .
fine .
sir , this ...
i ...
thanks for straightening me out there , tom .
right , right .
but i didn't get to say what i wanted to say .
oh , your ideas , of course .
schedule an appointment with my new secretary .
tom .
are you ok?
uh ... yeah , sure .
i'm guessing by the way you look he's on another one of his rampages this morning .
definitely .
damn .
i was hoping to catch him in a good mood .
yeah , that's , um ... that's probably not gonna happen .
i'm supposed to go to this party tonight , but my dad's making me housesit for his stupid bird while he's away this weekend .
well , why don't you go in there and tell him you're not gonna do it?
i can't just ...
you can't just what?
i mean , live your own life and have a free weekend?
no , it's not that .
wait , it is that .
yeah .
i should just go to that party .
yeah , of course .
well , um ...
ok , i'm gonna go back to , uh , work .
ok , sure .
tom?
i know this might seem a little out of place because we barely even know each other .
but , do you have any plans tonight?
no , no , no .
uh ... no .
i'm i'm wide open .
we won't be home too late .
hey , it's no problem .
so the party starts at 7 .
you could be at my dad's house by 6?
sure .
you sure you're cool with this?
are you kidding me?
tom , you're such a sweetheart .
thank you so much .
i'm gonna love you forever for this .
all right .
yeah , who's the man now?
see?
what'd i tell you?
i'm a lady killer .
how the hell could he be so excited about housesitting?
he's nice , daddy .
that's how .
most guys wouldn't even offer to do that .
i don't know if i want him around my bird .
oh , dad , will you just relax?
it's gonna be fine .
i promise , ok?
i'll check in as soon as i get there .
8 : 00 .
if i sense anything's wrong , you're coming back here .
ok .
ok .
very good .
right on time .
oh , sir .
uh ...
hey , is that a bear trap?
yes .
it's to keep the neighbor's kids out of my yard .
sir , i just wanted to let you know how much i appreciate you ... well ... letting tonight happen .
i mean , i know it means a lot to lisa , and i think you're doing the right thing .
i don't know what you're planning , stansfield , but you're attitude is making me very nervous .
those socks are clean , right?
um ...
you hesitated .
put those on .
are you serious?
if you want to watch tv , the remote's there .
that panel controls the lights , alarm , skylight , etc .
yeah , i probably won't use any of that stuff .
you know , since the party starts at 7 .
party?
i made it clear to lisa you're not to have any guests in here .
you're the only one allowed in the house .
what?
lisa's not here?
no .
of course not .
lisa's at the party ... and i'm staying here .
is this concept too complicated for you , stansfield?
don't touch the furniture .
and this is my bird's room .
he's got his own room?
that's cool .
how's my little boy?
this is oj .
oj?
like the murderer?
no .
like the football player .
oj simpson .
i've set the alarm .
when you hear it go off , feed him .
aw .
what do i feed these little guys?
they don't get fed .
they are the food .
his diet varies , but they're his favorites .
hey , don't you have to shut these doors?
not anymore .
he's been depressed since his mate died .
he won't fly .
just sits in his cage .
medication .
give him two of these at 10 : 00 .
i have to shove these down his throat?
just one .
the other is inserted into his rectum .
don't worry .
it's not too unpleasant for him .
he doesn't bite , does he?
no .
not unless you taunt him .
you're not planning on taunting him , are you , tom?
no .
i mean , that'd be really sick .
no , of course not .
and the most important thing , make sure he gets a pint of water .
the medication tends to dry him out and then he can't breathe .
ok .
well , i must be off .
henderson should be waiting outside .
henderson?
i thought you fired him .
because his ideas were stupid?
of course not .
he's gonna drive me to the train station .
so , you can leave as soon as lisa and hans get back .
hans?
lisa's boyfriend .
so remember , uh ... water in the bowl , medication , and ... anything happens to this house while i'm gone , i'll kill you .
you're housesitting?
you gotta be kidding me .
i know , it sucks .
what are you talking about?
don't you see?
this is a test .
you watch taylor's house , come up with a couple of great ideas and if everything goes smooth , you get the promotion .
you think so?
of course i do .
what could be easier?
what are you doing , hans?
come here .
baby , you're gonna burn so bad if you don't let me put this on you right now .
oh , my god .
you scared me , hans .
you're insane .
put that down .
want to put some on me?
put some lotion on me .
is jack around?
hey ... what?
who are you?
it's ok .
i'm red taylor .
i'm jack's son .
i let myself in the back .
oh .
hey .
tom stansfield .
hey .
tom , nice to meet you .
am i interrupting something here?
oh , no .
uh ...
i was ... uh ...
oh , your shoes .
nike .
uh , listen , tom , can you do me a favor?
i lost my tv guide .
i came over here to see if maybe my dad's got a copy of one .
you haven't seen a copy of the guide laying around , have you?
my sister in?
no , actually she's out for the evening .
bingo .
oh .
so , uh , you're here to ...
housesit .
oh .
yeah , it's probably for the best if you don't , uh , tell lisa that i stopped by .
why?
is there a problem?
well , you know how uptight she is .
really?
i'm more the free spirit of the family .
oh .
oh , boy .
see that right there?
kirstie alley?
yeah .
i dated her maid .
really?
i boned kirstie alley's maid .
and this is while they were making look who's talking .
wow , that's really something .
i'll tell you another thing .
you know michelle pfeiffer?
i did the deed with michelle pfeiffer's cousin .
wow .
right out there in those bushes .
right .
ah , she looked just like michelle , too , except she was brunette instead of blond , and she was kinda short and dumpy .
well , uh , ya certainly have an interesting life , fred .
you married , tom?
no .
i'm single .
no girlfriend?
no , and , no , actually i had a girlfriend , but we , uh , broke up .
listen , i really gotta get back to work , and since you got your tv guide and ...
so , you broke up , huh?
that's too bad .
was your ex a looker?
yeah .
yeah , in my opinion she was .
i bet you still keep a picture of her in your wallet .
yeah , i do .
can i see it?
yeah , i suppose .
ok .
let me find her in here .
there she is .
oh !
tom , you lucky man !
yeah .
oh , she is a real piece of ass !
oh , i could knock on that back door all day long !
yeah?
sh she's a pretty girl .
wow .
she has gotta be wicked in bed .
tell me she's wicked in bed , tom .
i bet you she banged your johnson raw every single night ,
ok ... ... 'cause that is one fine looking broad .
all right .
hey !
would ya ...
i me ...
you're talking about my girlfriend .
ex girlfriend , you said .
yeah , but still , it's ...
come on .
i'm just making conversation .
you know , guy talk .
look , i just ...
i don't tell comfortable talking about my intimate relationships with a complete stranger .
understood .
well , you know , given how uptight you are talking about sex , you pretty much answered the question .
i am not uptight !
ok?
just because i don't feel like revealing personal details about my ex girlfriend's sexual habits does not make me uptight .
i didn't ask you anything personal .
well , then , what the hell do you consider personal?
well , it'd be like , you know , if i asked you how big your rod was .
then i would be out of line , 100 % .
no , no !
that is no worse than asking me if my girlfriend's a nymph .
i just asked you if she dug sex .
besides , i wouldn't have asked if i'd known she was frigid .
yeah , well , she is not frigid !
are you leaving?
oh , yeah .
and listen .
could you do me a favor?
it's no big deal .
what?
a business associate of my dad's is gonna come by to pick this up .
it's frozen steaks , it's a gift .
it's not cold .
dad says that's the way the guy likes'em .
what are you gonna do?
will you give it to him?
just one second .
audrey .
tom .
let's go !
come on !
oh , i guess this makes sense .
he's got you living with him now?
uh , no .
i'm just watching his place .
he's ...
jack's out of town .
he is?
yeah .
aw , shoot !
i came by 'cause i was hoping to get my job back .
you know , the one that you got me canned from
'cause i made a bad cup of coffee?
remember that?
listen , i'm really sorry about that .
how can you fire someone for making a bad cup of coffee , huh?
i know .
that's what i tried to say to him .
i mean , who do you think you are juan fucking valdez?
i might have had a future at that place if you'd just give me half a chance .
let's get a move on , saddlebag !
oh , my god .
that's my idiot boyfriend .
hold your pants , you freakin 'psycho !
god .
he drives me crazy .
oh , hey , you know , since you're on the rug , would you mind putting these on?
they're medical ...
i got'em on , too .
ugh !
licorice .
i hate licorice .
i need water or i'm gonna throw up .
ugh !
thanks to you , i lost my second job inside a month and now i'm flat broke .
you lost another job?
yeah , i got fired from my waitress job just last friday .
why did they fire you?
oh , i don't know .
one of the assistant managers caught me making out with a customer .
excuse me?
well , i mean , actually the customer was my boyfriend .
i mean , he became my boyfriend after the incident anyway .
you got any beer in here?
uh ...
hey .
here we go .
would you mind putting these on?
it's a house rule .
oh , actually , that's a twist ...
aah !
that's the counter .
listen .
jack , is just a real stickler .
that'd be great .
no kidding .
i found that out this morning .
i swear i am gonna freak out and i'm gonna come in there ...
oh , man .
spike's in a real mood .
uh ...
don't even ... hey .
come on , come on , come on .
shit .
i swear to god , audrey ,
i'll piss on this guy's front steps !
let's go !
if you don't open this door this second , i'm gonna come in there and ...
hi .
don't worry .
nothing broke .
hey .
baby , come on .
what are you doing leaving me in the goddamn car?
shake that tail , baby .
come on .
let's get a move on .
hold your horses .
try acting civilized .
audrey !
this is tom , the guy that i was telling you about from the office .
oh , the coffee dude .
you got some black ass karma headed your way , superfreak .
oh , we don't need no lecture from you , mr. high and mighty .
hey , shut that sass trap of yours , little lady , before i bounce you off the wall !
look , i would appreciate it if you would take this outside , please .
hey , i'd appreciate it if you'd go and buy yourself a bagel , jewy .
jewy?
i'm not jewish .
and i don't think that making fun of the ...
don't pay attention to him .
he's nuts .
i'm nuts?
who do you think you are?
look , can we please take this outside?
oh , come on .
you know what you are?
you're a filthy , little tramp .
me?
what about you and that waitress?
keep going .
i never touched her ever .
swear?
so help me god .
you swear on your mama's life?
hell , woman , i ain't gonna swear on my mama's life .
why not?
if you're telling the truth .
i think he's telling the truth , audrey .
then why won't you swear on your mama's life?
well , because i don't feel like i have the right to gamble with my mama's life , that's why .
gamble?
but apparently you got nothing to worry about unless you're iying like a hunk of morgue meat .
hey , i ain't gonna sit here and get called a liar by no skankin 'whore !
who you calling a whore , you shrimp dick bastard? !
audrey , see now you're just provoking him .
that's a vicious , flat out , bold faced lie and you know it !
is it?
is it?
i don't think so !
i'll whip it out right now !
no , no , no .
i don't wanna see it .
i'm gonna whip it out right now and prove to you that she's a iying slut !
keep your meat in the fridge !
you wanna see my piece?
all right .
all right !
that is enough !
go get me a ruler , tom !
you go get ...
that is it .
i don't care if you have a tiny shrimp dick !
or a giant whale dick , which that's ...
goddamn it , audrey !
you tell him you're a liar or i'm gonna smash your face in , i swear !
wait a minute !
you put that down !
all right .
can we please just use fists?
come here , you little ...
you hit me , you bastard !
i did not and you know it !
he hit me !
he hit me as sure as i'm standing right here !
did you hit her , spike?
yes .
with an open hand .
it was with an open hand .
so what if it's open?
you can't ...
then it don't count .
says who?
says anyone .
ask the jew .
all right , that's it .
you two have got to leave .
all right , that's fine .
but she is not coming with me .
you are not welcome in the double ride .
fine , i don't care .
i don't need your lousy trailer .
i'll stay right here with tom .
fine .
stay with tom .
i'll stay right here .
wait a minute .
whoa .
guys , you need to try to work this thing out .
he hit me !
he knocked me on my can !
i know .
i know .
well , but it was with an open hand after all , and ...
relationships have their ups and downs , you guys , and you don't want to ruin this great ...
oh , god .
the bird .
oj !
oh , my god .
you come back here or tom's gonna kick your butt !
so take that !
ooh , i'm shaking in my boots , baby !
look at those two , oj .
oh , i ain't running away , dummy !
hello?
hi , tom .
how are ya?
hey .
lisa , i'm great .
i'm great .
is that oj?
yeah , yeah .
we just had a little drink of water .
i haven't heard him squawk in years .
oh , yeah .
he's quite the crazy bird , you know .
yeah .
anyway , tom , i just wanted you to know how much i appreciate you helping me out tonight .
but i'd like to crash at a friend's place tonight after the party .
would you think it was horrible if i asked you to stay the whole night tonight?
oh , well ...
i i don't think your dad would want me staying here .
please?
yeah .
i suppose i could stay .
thanks , tom .
i really appreciate it .
see you tomorrow .
i ain't afraid of you and tom sure as hell ain't scared neither !
butthead !
loser !
oh , my god .
thank god he's gone .
hey , so is it ok if i stay here tonight?
oh , man , it's ... it's not even my house .
oh , yeah .
ok .
well , i sure as hell don't want any charity .
i mean , it's not like you owe me anything , so ...
and i'm sorry about that whole office thing .
i know that you didn't mean to get me fired .
yeah .
you didn't deserve to get fired .
thanks .
ok .
well , i guess i'll just go try to find a homeless shelter then .
wait a second .
yeah?
god .
look , i suppose you can stay .
really?
oh !
thanks , tom .
you're the best .
oh , and i'll clean up the kitchen , ok?
ok .
ok .
ok .
yeah .
one second .
there's somebody at the door .
hi .
uh , can i help you?
vasquez sent me here to pick up a package .
oh , you're the ...
yeah , yeah , yeah .
red told me you might be stopping by .
uh ...
oh , hi .
i'm tom .
what is this , oprah?
just give me the goddamn package .
oh , ok .
yeah .
um ...
i think this is it .
if this ain't kosher , i'm gonna break his thumbs .
oh , well , by law , it should be stamped right on the package there .
what ...
oh .
dinnertime , buddy .
oj ... today's specials include a scrumptious buffet of mice kebabs .
aah !
shit !
ah ... crap !
you son of a bitch .
i got you now , buddy .
dude , that was cool .
oh , my god .
tommy , easy on the antiques .
was that an owl?
yes .
oj got out .
how is he flying?
well , he is a bird .
he ... no , jack said that he ...
aw , shit !
i gotta find him .
don't worry .
he'll probably come back when he's hungry .
no , i have to find him or i'm gonna lose my job !
you know what?
this isn't gonna help your chances of getting your job back either .
ok .
where the hell is he?
tom , relax .
relax?
oj's loose !
this is no time to relax !
tom !
he's right over here !
right there , right there , right there !
oj !

oh , red .
oh , so dad told you?
about what?
the restraining order .
how's that?
yeah , red's not allowed within 100 yards of me , my dad , or this house .
he ... uh , he didn't he didn't mention that .
red's a freak .
you don't want to be around my dad if he finds out anyone was in this house , especially red .
it's like wherever he is , there's trouble .
i mean , one time , he had this big party 'cause dad was out of town and my dad came home early ...
hey , uh ... you know , since the mouse is gone , what say we , uh , go back inside?
ok .
it was up for an oscar?
i hated it !
i know !
oh , i hated that movie !
man , i can't believe you .
you're like ... you're so different from how you are at work .
what am i gonna do?
like , walk around with my walter payton jersey?
no , no .
i get it .
it's , like , at work you have to be lisa taylor : the , you know , loyal employee to the family firm .
and i have to be ...
tom ...
tom stansfield : the guy who will do anything for anybody .
yup .
that's me .
i swear , it's like i can just talk to you about anything .
i know , exactly .
it's ...
yeah , this is crazy .
yeah , it is .
i guess it's because there's no attraction between us , you know?
you know , there's none of that sexual tension .
yeah .
it's like i'm with a girlfriend .
it's great , isn't it?
yeah .
i mean , maybe we could go to the mall sometime and go shopping .
that would be fun !
wouldn't it be fun?
yeah .
wait , you have to listen to this song .
come on , i need someone to dance with !
you don't want to see me dance .
come on , dance with me .
i have no idea what i'm doing .
come on .
put your hands together .
yeah !
now go underneath .
what ... like this?
yeah !
like that?
yeah !
hold on , hold on .
watch , watch , watch .
yeah !
oh ...
i'm trying to do too much .
i'm a dancer .
catch me .
oh ... what?
i got you !
whoa !
ok .
i am doomed .
here .
oh , i love this song .
my friend jenny does this really wild strip routine for her boyfriend to this song .
it's super sexy .
even you'd appreciate it .
i wish i could be like her , you know?
she's so free and everything .
so , what do you think?
ah , it's ... it's , uh , very nice .
so if you weren't gay , this would turn you on , right?
gay?
who said i was gay?
my father .
you mean it's not true?
no !
no?
god , i'm so embarrassed !
i can't believe you'd let me do this !
i didn't mean to ...
i mean , um ...
why would your father say that i'm gay?
i don't know .
well , you can't blame him entirely .
i mean , you are a little feminine .
don't be hurt .
it's ok .
hans is a bit of feminine , too .
what exactly did hans do anyway?
well , it's not like he did just one thing .
it's more about trust .
yeah .
trust is ... it's important .
trust is everything .
i don't know .
maybe it's me .
it's like i'm just sending out some kind of vibe .
i can't attract a decent guy .
no .
what's wrong with me?
don't even worry about it .
you're gonna find another guy so fast .
i mean , look at you .
you're amazing .
you really think so?
why do you think i'm here tonight?
oh , god , tom .
you didn't know .
you thought that ...
uh ... uh ...
i'm gonna ...
i'll be right back .
i'm just gonna go and check and see if audrey needs towels .
tom , you don't have to lie to me .
if you have to go to the bathroom , go take a crap and come back .
what the ... hey !
what the hell are you doing here , man?
you try to bone vasquez out of 20 grand and you ask me what i'm doing?
you think i work for mrs. fields?
you think my boss likes to bake cookies?
whoa !
what are you doing?
come on .
you tried to sell me flour .
flour?
i i don't even know what you're talk ...
what are you ...
come on !
look , i'm just housesitting for my boss .
who's your boss?
jack taylor .
jack taylor , huh?
i did time in joliet with a jack taylor .
average height , medium hair , horrible case of folliculitis on his ass?
i wouldn't know about the folliculitis .
i thought you said he was your boss .
he is .
and you never saw his ass?
why would i see my boss's ass?
it stands to reason .
you work for a guy long enough , sooner or later , you're gonna get a glimpse of his ass .
listen , i i don't know what line of work you're in , but i've never seen my boss's ass .
hey , man ...
hey !
hey , stop it or i'm gonna call the cops !
and tell them what?
your drug deal went bad?
you rat me out , i'm gonna carve you up like a turkey and beat your kids with what's left of you .
i don't have any kids .
i can wait .
excuse me .
hello?
right .
ok .
tommy , let's get clear on something .
in the next 60 minutes , i'm gonna bring vasquez what he paid for or your gift wrapped nuts .
oh , hi , tom .
what's going on?
yeah .
that's what i wanna know .
what's going on with your dad's gift?
see ...
do you see that guy?
he was gonna kill me !
don't you think you're overreacting a little , tom?
overreacting?
the guy had a knife !
i don't think that i am overreacting !
he probably just had the wrong address .
i mean , there's gotta be over a dozen jack taylor's in chicago alone .
i'm gonna go to my dad's bedroom .
you tell me if the guy shows up again .
all right .
all right .
you listen to me .
you're not even supposed to be in this house .
says who?
i know about the restraining order , red .
restraining shmaining .
i mean , that's just a big misunderstanding .
tom !
it's oj !
whoa .
hey .
who are you?
i'm here to see lisa .
my name's hans .
is that so shocking?
no .
what , you surprised she'd go out with someone like me?
no , no .
it's not ...
give me a break , man .
you oughta be ashamed of yourself .
let me tell you something .
there are a lot of girls out there who can see past the fact that i just happen to be ... a few pounds overweight .
you know , inside i'm just like everyone else .
let me get you a tissue .
thank you .
i'm on the second day of a new diet .
hey , uh , hans ...
i gave up chocolate .
i'm really sorry .
i think that , uh , we just got off on the wrong foot .
oh ... uh ...
it's good to meet you , hans .
i'm tom .
i'm just a friend of lisa's .
oh , great .
well , maybe you can help me .
is she here?
lisa !
lisa !
whoa .
hans , you know what?
maybe right now isn't a great time for you to see lisa .
what say , uh , we get you a drink?
oh , ok .
yeah , she's probably really upset .
you see , we got in a misunderstanding tonight and , well , she left me .
wow , that's unfortunate .
yeah .
uh , what happened?
well , i think seeing me naked from behind like that kind of shocked her .
oh .
so , tonight was the first time .
yeah .
tonight was the first time .
it was awesome .
i mean , i was iying up on the bed like this with one leg straight up in the air .
i don't think i really need to see ...
and i had a handful of ass right here ...
whoa . ... and i had a handful of this .
hans , please .
whoa .
god , you're ... that's ...
and that's when lisa walked in .
what?
she caught me in the bed with a blonde .
what?
aw , come on , man .
tell me you haven't ever wanted to do it with a ...
hans .
hans .
no ... you cheated on her .
you know something , tom?
you're right .
aw .
i guess that was cheating .
and now i've gone and lost everyone .
i should have known from the start it wasn't right .
she kept telling me i reminded her of her dad .
hans , you gotta realize that this is over , you know?
and you gotta put an end to it , and and move on .
and get yourself to a better place , ok?
yes .
i think you know what i mean .
yeah , i do know what you mean .
and i'm ready .
i know what i have to do .
well , i guess this is good bye .
oj !
thanks , tom .
oj , come back !
oj !
hello .

i'm sorry .
i'm hard of hearing .

my name is tom !
i could've sworn julie said your name was albert .
no , see , i'm afraid that you're mistaken .

yes .
this is julie's date , albert .
ah !
ah !
this is my nephew , george .
he's blind and crippled .
oh .
uh ... nice to meet you .
i'm not deaf .
excuse me .
i'll go see what's keeping julie .
she's probably nervous .
so you're julie's date , huh?
no .
i'm just ...
i just came here .
i was looking for an owl .
you don't have to make lame excuses .
listen , do you know what the advantage is in being a cripple?
no , i can't say that i do .
you don't really care to hear much what i have to say , do you?
no , no .
it's not that .
i'm ...
you know what?
go ahead , i'm listening .
sit down , tom .
you know what i gained by becoming a quad?
what , are you shaking your head?
i can't see , you know !
i'm sorry .
uh ... uh ...
tell me what you gained .
i no longer need my viagra .
now i can maintain my arousal for hours .
that's that's great .
i guess things have a way of evening themselves out in the long run , huh?
no , not really .
and do you know why?
no , why?
because i am a blind , quad freak , you moron !
what , you think women dig this? !
i mean , you think women go ...
well , hello . ... 'i wanna give that mutant freak my number '?
ken morehouse .
i'm julie's dad .
hey , nice to meet you .
is , uh , george boring you with his self pitying tripe?
tripe ...

oh , julie .
julie , this is albert .
albert , julie .
it's nice to meet you , albert .
wow .
it's ... wow .
it's nice to meet you , too .

that is to say that i'm not your date .
oh ...
there's been a giant misunderstanding .
oh , how could you?
i knew this would happen !
no , i'm telling the truth .
julie wasn't pretty enough for you , mr. gq?
is that it?
no , you don't understand .
oh , i understand , fabio .
you broke that poor girl's heart .
no , no .

do you think she bought your little fairy tale
mr. i'm too sexy for my medical booties?
oh , th ...

or i'll kick your pretty boy ass to kingdom come .
am i interrupting something?
no , it's just that the ...
tom , there's two things that we need to talk about .
what?
first of all , i don't wanna wear these booties anymore .
no one else is wearing the booties .
fine .
what's the other thing?
tina thinks she's got cancer .
do you feel it?
uh , i'm just ...
what's supposed to be there?
i don't ...
see , tina?
move your hand to the left .
now move it around .
don't you feel anything?
yeah .
i mean , no , no .
no , it seems to be ...
well ...
tina , your breast is no different than mine , ok?
it is .
there's no comparison .
tom , feel my breast and compare .
now , do you detect any difference between our breasts?
well ...
you gotta slow down a little .
it sure feels good .
well , yours is a ...
lisa , this isn't what it looks like .
i believed everything you said .
i'm ...
it was all just a bunch of lines , wasn't it?
no , no .
lisa , it was all ...
i swear to you , i meant every word .
this is ... nothing's going on here .
great , tom .
i'm glad you think i'm a complete idiot .
no , no .
i'm telling you .
i was just checking these girls for breast cancer .
you make me sick .
no ...
lisa , wait !
she's never gonna forgive me .
of course she will .
is this the first time you cheated on her?
yeah .
no !
i ... yeah ... wait .
i didn't cheat on her .
i mean , you were there for god's sakes !
look , i know that you didn't cheat on her .
i mean , you were a little grabby , but ...
i ...
look , don't you think we should just find the owl and worry about your little 'affair 'later?
i ...
i am get ...
i'm getting angry and i don't get angry .
ugh !
hey , speed?
hey , can i ask you a question?
what are you ...

i'm doing'em right now .
and release .
well , when in rome ...
oh , canada
'jack taylor .
rectacid .
apply liberally to buttocks as needed to reduce redness and other symptoms of folliculitis . '
son of a bitch .
did you piss yourself?
no , i did not piss myself .
looks like you did .
well , i didn't .
it was that maniac downstairs .
we gotta stop him before he tears this house apart .
you know what you gotta do?
give him one of these little babies .
what's that?
it's a sleeping pill .
i got'em from speed .
here .
so strong , so be careful .
it's powerful stuff .
here .
just one .
be careful .
hey .
excuse me .
you know , i just wanted to apologize for pulling that gun on you earlier .
that was totally out of line .
hey , you know , i don't even know your name .
i'm tj .
tj?
that's nice .
i guess maybe i was out of line by pissing all over everything .
man ... that was funny .
yeah , i've always enjoyed a good prank .
what are you drinking there?
whiskey .
you want some?
there's plenty of booze around here , that's for sure .
yeah , i'll take a shot of bourbon .
oh , my god !
wow !
what?
whoa !
look at those two blondes going at ...
oh , wait , are there three of them?
where?
they're going at it right up there on the second floor .
where are you looking?
right th ... uh ...
oh , man , they left .
damn .
i was all psyched up for some action .
lesbians are very special .
oh ...
hey , i'll drink to that , huh?
cheers .
all right .
mmm .
oh , are you ...
whoa .
here .
why don't i ...
audrey?
audrey !
oh , my god !
he's like a human vibrator .
what ...
all right , what is wrong with him?
i don't know .
did you slip him the pill?
yes .
then that must be it then .
you didn't give him the pill with whiskey , did you?
yeah .
oh , no !
you're not supposed to mix the two .
audrey , you did not tell me that !
everyone knows that you're not supposed to mix booze with pills !
come on !
ok .
is he gonna be ok?
don't worry .
he'll be fine .
i used to be a paramedic .
tom?
i think i found oj .
oj?
i don't care about ...
we have a situation here .
audrey , call 911 !
i'm telling ya , he'll be fine .
are you sure?
he just needs some rest .
i'm positive .
ok .
you watch tj .
use this .
it's not loaded , but he doesn't know that .
oh , man !
oh , hey .
julie .
from ... yeah .
down the block .
that's right .
you mind if i come in?
all right .
you grab his ankles ...
why don't we go to that room over there?
ok , yeah , i got this end .
man , he's heavy .
do you mind if i sit down?
uh ... yeah .
sure .
thank you .
oh , hey .
sorry to butt in .
hi , i'm red .
hi , it's nice to meet you .
nice to meet ya .
anyway , i realized you were telling the truth when my real date showed up .
of course he didn't stick around .
well , that guy is a bum .
well , i'm sure that had nothing to do with you .
no , i know it did .
i've never had any guys attracted to me , even before the accident .
now that cannot be true .
well ... about six months ago , i was hitchhiking and a trucker tried to rape me , but other than that ...
come on .
you're gonna tell me , you never had a real boyfriend?
well , once , but i think he just felt sorry for me .
oh , well , uh ... how long did that last?
um ... about six years and then one day , he just left .
another woman?
no .
he got hit by a bus .
well , see that's not your fault .
well , he didn't seem to try very hard to avoid the bus .
i think he just wanted out of the relationship .
julie , why don't you sit in this chair?
oh , geez , i'm starting to feel a bit woozy .
ok .
all right , i have to go find oj .
so , red , if you could watch things for me , that'd be great .
got ya .
look , i think you're being way too hard on yourself .
i mean , besides , i bet there've been a lot of guys who've been attracted to you .
no , he was the only one .
what about that trucker?
i mean , he was obviously attracted to you .
i think the trucker probably would have raped anyone .
i doubt that .
you were probably pretty special to him .
so sweet of you , red .
i'm not just jerking your chain either .
i mean it .
yeah .
what are you doing to the lawn?
it's ok , tom .
we just had to bury tj .
bury ... what?
you mean , he's ...
you said he was gonna be ok !
i thought you were a paramedic .
well , i took a course .
you took ... you you guy ...
you can't just bury him , you guys !
well , we're not gonna put him in my car .
that's right .
all right .
forget it .
i'm calling 911 .
that's for emergencies .
what do you think this is?
the guy's dead .
in 20 minutes , he's still gonna be dead .
there's no sense of urgency here .
no , we have to call the cops and report it !
and tell'em what?
the truth !
that there was a ... accident .
they might not see it that way .
let's face it , tom .
you did kill him .
you gave me the pill .
hey , i didn't tell you to kill nobody , ok?
well , you didn't tell me not to use the whiskey !
well , if you'd listen to me ...
you didn't say anything about whiskey !
i would think you would listen to me !
there's no time for blame games .
why don't you spread around some leaves?
make it look good .
i am not gonna help you conceal a dead body !
hey , you know what?
don't you think we should say something?
what?
you know what?
she's right .
some kind of last rites or eulogy or something like that?
i'm so screwed .
we should say something .
fine , fine .
you know what?
say something .
get ... just make it quick .
lord , this day we lay to rest tj , who was , uh ...
i really didn't know him .
i don't know him .
i mean , tom , you know him the best .
why don't you say something?
me?
yeah .
all i know is that the guy was a violent , sadistic goon that was into lesbians .
amen .
tom?
lisa .
i can't believe you're still here .
listen , please .
you have to let me explain .
look , tom .
tonight was just a big mistake .
that's all there is to it .
no , you ... that ... what you saw with the girls , all that was weird timing .
red?
what's red doing here?
red?
oh , uh , red was in the neighborhood and he and he stopped by .
but , you see , nothing really bad happened tonight .
is he the reason oj's gone?
no .
no , uh ...
oj got loose .
and that's a little problem .
but we're gonna find him .
and we're looking for him , so ...
what's this?
oh , uh , tom killed a guy and we're burying the body .
ok , that was bad .
aah !
ok , well , now you're overreacting .
it's not ...
all right , all right , hey .
anybody moves , there's gonna be a big hole where her brain used to be .
yeah .
go ahead , shoot .
well , what are you waiting for?
come on !
what are you waiting for? !
waste the bitch !
tom !
no , i don't give a shit !
hey , i'm not joking , asshole .
yeah?
pull the trigger .
come on .
come on !
i think you're just all talk .
looks like we both got guns .
who's gonna shoot first this time?
well , that should do it .
tom !
you are so brave .
no , no .
it's not even that big of a deal .
this gun's not even loaded ...
what the hell is going on?
i never should have doubted you .
you risked your life for me .
audrey found some bullets in the kitchen and i may have reloaded it .
yeah , i did .
yo , excuse me .
does anyone here know a jack taylor?
why?
this dude just called , said if i don't pick him up at the train station in 15 minutes ,
i'm out of a job .
what do you suppose that means?
oh , my god .
that's what i thought , 'cause i ain't got no job .
he's coming home early .
ok , don't worry about it .
i'll take care of everything , ok?
trust me .
just don't drive too fast .
got it .
and , um , maybe you should put that away .
oh , god .
i knew that was you .
as long as we're in thailand for the meeting on monday afternoon .
yeah .
we can pick it up when we refuel in hawaii .
hey , uh , do you wanna stop and , uh , get something to drink , go to the bathroom or something?
we'll take the departmental heads now and the creative team in a couple of weeks .
that's the agenda up to lunch , then there's lunch ...
ok .
and then ...
ok .
ok .
ok , fine .
stansfield , what are you doing?
nothing , sir .
hold on a moment , please .
stansfield ... why don't you just concentrate on the driving and let me get on with making my call .
wait !
what is it now , stansfield?
oh , nothing , sir .
almost home .
hey .
how'd this get in there?
oh , be careful with that .
i will .
good thing i found it .
there's several ways to properly dispose of a handgun , none of which include putting it in a garbage bag .
freeze !
police !
freeze !
let go of the girl and put your hands in the air !
you're completely surrounded , tj !
put down your weapons and put your hands on you head !
no , you guys .
wait .
he's not tj .
i'm lisa taylor .
this is my dad's house .
ma'am , we've received numerous reports from this neighborhood : theft , gunfire ...
all right .
look , i know you probably think we may have killed somebody , but tom didn't know he poisoned the guy , and we thought he was dead when we buried him .
but he seems ok now .
his head's just a little bloody from where we hit him with the shovel .
and i swear when tom shot the gun off , he didn't think it was loaded
'cause i put the bullets back in , so if you'll all just step inside , you'll see there's nobody dead here .
he may have had the wind knocked out of him temporarily , but with a little first aid , i think he'll be just fine .
holy mother of god !
hans !
yes , i see .
i see .
ok , fine .
could you say that again?
you're breaking up !
one moment , please .
oj !
i just can't understand why you would do this .
hans , what were you thinking?
he'll be fine .
he may complain about a sore throat , but he's in a lot better shape than this chandelier .
well , i'd hate to be here when the owner gets back .
you can say that again .
tom !
daddy !
what do we got?
what was that?
watch the glass , ok , everybody?
let's get'em out of the car .
oh , my god !
daddy !
everybody , stay back and remain calm .
are you all right?
that's him .
that's the one spying on me through the bushes .
he shot the bullet right through my julie's bedroom window .
here .
tell'em , julie .
you guys , tom wants the body in here .
take it easy .
put me down .
stansfield , what have you done?
lisa , pack your things .
you're coming with me to thailand .
no !
get his ass out of here .
it's funny you should mention the word 'ass ', jack .
why don't we start by talking about yours .
excuse me?
lisa , your father is not who you think he is .
the whole publishing operation .
it's a great cover .
now how'd you do it?
what'd you do?
did you hollow out the books?
oh , and locating the plant in thailand .
it's genius !
what are you talking about?
what am i ...
jack .
you know , i i would've believed you , jack ... until i met this man , who seems to know a lot about ya .
recognize this?
i hear it's very effective in relieving folliculitis .
i don't have folliculitis .
he's given me no choice .
he's given me no choice !
tom , what are you doing?
this is insane !
yeah?
take a look at your dad's ass .
no !
then tell me i'm insane , huh?
huh?
look at it !
look at it !
huh?
huh?
ooh ...
what?
oh , that's nasty .
i told you i don't have folliculitis , you blithering idiot .
well , guys , the ointment must have worked .
let's go .
wait !
i have something to show ya .
what's with this movie and the ass cheeks?
my real name is jack taylor ...
jr .
red is my nickname .
now you know why .
i'm the whole reason that tj's here .
goddamn it , red .
you've been dealing drugs out of my house !
no , dad , i swear .
i gave this guy a bag of flour .
i dumped a kilo of the real stuff down the toilet .
i'm finished dealing for good .
the lime green toilet with the wooden seat?
yeah , why?
wait a second .
he's flying .
he's flying .
get him out of my sight .
now .
lisa , let's go .
that's the one .
he got my ear !
evander holyfield's ear .
you have to right to remain silent .
anything you say can and ...
lisa , wait !
that's holyfield's ear for god's sake .
oj?
oj !
come to daddy .
how's my little boy?
you're going with him?
what choice do i have?
he needs me .
are you actually feeling sorry for him?
he's manipulating you and you are buying it .
all right , fine .
you do what you gotta do .
i am gonna bail tom out of jail .
with what?
your drug money?
no , no , no .
i stole this out of dad's safe .
look , the important thing is , somebody has gotta help tom .
you know that nothing that happened here last night was any of his fault .
it's funny .
the nicest guy in the world's the only one with enough balls to stand up to dad .
all he wanted to do was to spend some time with you .
look what it gets him .
classic dad .
i'm not allowed in the house , you're not allowed out of it .
he doesn't care about us .
only that stupid bird .
hey , red , can i tell you something?
sure .
i know this is gonna sound weird , but ever since i was a little kid ...
i used to always wish that i was that stupid bird .
look , i think it's about time you talk to dad .
at least tell him how you feel .
you can do it .
don't you see , we have no reason to be afraid of him?
daddy !
lisa , don't let him do this to you .
lisa !
tom !
red bailed me out ... and told me you were here and i'm not letting you go .
yeah , but i'm ...
no .
you're gonna let me finish .
i went through hell last night and it was my fault 'cause i let people do it to me .
and now you're gonna make the same mistake .
yeah , but ...
this isn't what you want .
this is what your father wants .
and you know what?
maybe you and i ... never are gonna work .
and that hurts .
but not as much as watching you be controlled by a ruthless tyrant that would screw his own mother if he thought it'd help him get ahead ...
tom !
i'm not going .
she's she's not going .
is this whole concept too complicated for you , stansfield?
no .
no .
all right .
wha ...
i ...
what made you stay?
that .
how did you guys ...
we finally had our long overdue talk .
then then who's taking your place in thailand?
he is .
what's this?
ow !
i'm kidding .
i don't wanna go .
i'm afraid .
nonsense .
everyone knows that , uh ...
asian people are very intimidated by , uh ...
tall men?
canadians?
republicans?
blacks?
henderson?
yes , sir .
i won't have that kind of thinking in this company .
there's no room for racism here .
you're fired .
now , tom , the point that i'm getting to is that with a big part of the team away ,
i'm gonna want you to take over the creative department .
me?
no need to be modest .
i saw those ideas you left in the living room .
your theory on the jfk thing , brilliant .
and the moon landing , a hoax?
you're really on to something there .
that's the kind of thinking that's gonna sell books .
uh , thank you , sir .
bye , daddy .
have a safe flight .
well , dad ... that's fantastic .
you promoted tom .
yeah , well , i figure anyone who's got the guts to piss on my persian carpet has gotta have what it takes .
stansfield !
what the hell are you doing?
just trying to get my job back , sir .
you know , after everything that happened , after all i went through ,
i guess it was my lucky day .
and i'm not the only one .
based on lisa and red's suggestions ,
jack restructured the company from top to bottom .
even instituting casual fridays every day .
and last friday was henderson's 27th straight day on the job without being fired .
oj's back off the drugs and now he only drinks beer .
but he still has an occasional flashback .
jack begged audrey to come back , but she got a job at , of all places , a coffee shop .
this is terrible !
hans succeeded in turning around the company's factory in thailand .
but apparently he's still struggling to cope with the local customs .
back of bus !
excuse me?
you people belong back of bus .
that's an outrage !
man , i'm not gonna let you treat me like that merely because i'm ...
smoking !
smokers belong back of bus !
as for me , with my new promotion ,
i could at last write books based on my own experiences .
so i did .
thank you .
and lisa was finally able to pursue a career that she loved .
'why does everything bad always happen to me? '
well , i don't get those people ...
'cause i've learned that if they just stop and look around , they'd realize that everything happens for a reason .
