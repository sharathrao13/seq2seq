my old man wrote me a letter from prison once .
it said , " if you don't wanna end up like me , stay away from crime , women and drugs .

ten years in paradise living the dream .
it had to come to an end one day .
but there was a time when me and the playboy had the world in our hands .
anyway , fuck it .
better to be someone for a day than no one for a lifetime .
what is it?
learjet .
only way to travel .
be someone .
i have only one thing to say .
you turn if you want to .
the lady's not for turning .
someone's had it .

i never lifted your money !
leave her alone , joe .
it's all right .
i'll sort it .

so , what's your plans?
i dunno .
i'll see you out , then .
you had to wonder how this character ended up on the beaches of spain .
you drive .
it was never about the money for charlie .
it was about the power and what went with it .
and could you fucking blame him?
he just loved the lifestyle .
stay down !
don't look at me !
don't fucking look at me !
i shit you not , he walked on water .
everything he touched turned to gold .
his fucking bed made itself in the mornings .
that's how cool he was .
what you fucking do that for , you lunatic?
you've just fucked us !
and fucked 'em , he had .
everyone knew it was the peckham four .
there was a national witch hunt for them .
but the police were too busy nicking fare dodgers and junkie bag snatchers , while charlie and the gunman slipped across the drink towards spain .
like i said , he walked on fucking water .
you can drive , can't you?
this is where it's at , son .
look around you .
shot to pieces back in london .
play your cards right , and i might give you a job in the club .

my shirley loves you .
the story goes , danny and ronnie were on the run for a robbery that went wrong .

champagne for everyone .
frankie , you got this , son?

good boy .
ha , ha !
frankie , are you still with us , kid?
yeah .

we could do with a driver .

yeah , why not?
i'll stick you on the payroll and put you in charge of the merc .
not unless you've got to go back to england for something?
i don't know what to say , charlie .
well , don't , then .
i've gotta teach you how to drive , though .
now you try .
hola .

i'd like to put you over this bar and fuck you in the arse .

no surprises for guessing which one he was in the robbery .
the geezer was so hard , even his nightmares were scared of him .
what you do that for , you lunatic?
you've fucked us !
we've gotta go on our fucking toes now .
well , good .
i hate this fucking weather , anyway .
sammy had been in gibraltar helping a flamenco singer called carlos , who was being bullied by some dutch drug smugglers that were using his house by the sea as a lookout to bring marijuana in from morocco .
everything's gonna be all right .
if charlie was the playboy , sammy was the businessman .
and he knew if he had carlos in his pocket , he could smuggle drugs from africa himself .
carry on , charlie .
hey , i said sorry .
now leave it .
and drugs , unlike the waiter , were the future .
and that was sammy , the partner .
he was a bit like robin hood , apart from the fact he robbed anyone and gave to himself , and probably killed their familiesjust for fun .
nice fellow , eh?
charming , don't you think?
and from the moment he met me , he fucking hated me .
he was only trying to serve me lunch on a dirty plate .
you know what i'm like .
you will eat in low end places , won't you?
low end?
they charge an absolute fucking fortune in there .
i should have glassed every one of 'em .
sammy , this is the kid frankie .
he drives us now .
did you miss me?
terribly .
how was gibraltar?
ream , charl .
i've got this singer carlos in our pocket .
he's even coming down the club tonight .
this little dutch firm , they're finished .
carlos is ours .
do me a favour , go and sort yourself out and tell me about it when we get home .
you're bleeding over the fucking deck .
darling , it's horizontal strokes .
let me finish .
i like that bit .
what was it?
horizontal strokes .
sorry .
listen , charl .
what?
i really appreciate what you've done for me .
but ... ... maybe i should go now .
i don't wanna get in the way here .
it's all right , son .
you're with me .
i told you , don't worry about sammy .
he's wild , but he's got a good heart .
anyway , fuck all that bollocks .
there's a party down at the club tonight .
i need you to drive us .
that dutch firm might show up .
wanna come for a swim , frankie?
i'm carlos and i'm pleased to meet you .
and you , carlos .
sammy tells me you've got a little problem we might be able to help you with .
i'm hoping so , please .
you're with us now , son .
you ain't gotta worry about them fucking dutch mugs any more .
we'll take care of that for you .
i've gotta tell you , you look better on the lp covers than you do in the flesh .
what happened?
you look fucked .
ah , los banderos ingleses .
what's he say?
he said you are criminals from england .
tell him to fuck off .
no , no , no , whoa .
no .
offer him some champagne .
from us .
go on .
that's the mayor .
looks like a fucking iron .
he probably is .
ingleses , muchas gracias .
you're welcome .
oh !
sammy , the dutch are in the club .
danny , the dutch are here .
let's go !
ronnie , they're here !
come on .
move it !
go and sit in the corner .
we've got aggro , charles .
the dutch .
charles , cop for it .
no .
not in here .
i wasn't that stupid .
i knew the difference between right and wrong and i knew i should have gone , right there and then .
but as much as i was out of my depth , something kept pulling me back .
give us a kiss .
give us a kiss !
come here , boy .
put that out .
right , here are the rules .
you take her shopping , you let her get what she wants .
you take her to lunch , you let her eat what she wants .
but you take her to a bar drinking and that's when we fall out .
i get back from gibraltar and i find she's drunk , i'm gonna fucking kill you .
we understand each other?
and one last thing , you even think about trying to get hold of her ...
sammy , i'd never do that .
she's your lady .
all right .
we'll be back just before sunset .
ok .
good luck with the dutch .
shut your mouth about the dutch .
it's nothing to do with you .
while sammy and charlie went to make a deal with the dutch ,
i had to look after the snake .
the way she fucked with people's heads , i should have stayed in bed .
would you like to see the menu?
a bottle of bollinger , please .
no .
please .
no .
one glass .
no .
i'll tell sammy you raped me .
one glass .
a bottle , please .
fuck !
me?
shut up a minute .
they're back .
how are you supposed to drive me in that?
are you sober?
can i smell your breath?
it's all right .
remember , you haven't had a drink .
maybe .
dirty fucking dutch !
liberty taking ...
hi , darling .
hey , charlie .
you seen what they've done to the merc?
what's happened to you?
they've fucking shot the car to pieces , that's what they've done .
get danny and ronnie and tell them we need them at the club tonight .
oi !
i said , get danny and ronnie and get yourself back here .
we need to check this lot's working .
you're bleeding everywhere .
you'd better get up the hospital .
five is a prime number , innit , charl?
don't fucking drive me mad , sam .
it's half down to you that i've got this .
i asked you , what about the dutch firm?
are they heavy?
do we do business with them?
no , not you .
not sammy brooks .
he wants to run around fucking killing people .
what do you reckon , boys?
nice , eh?
not the espadrilles .
you need heels , babe .
i'm obviously not gonna wear it with fucking espadrilles .
i was just showing you .
sweet?
amazing .
ain't nothing getting through these vests .
good .
try it on me .
yeah?
how far?
from about where you was .
are you ready?
go on , then .
fuck !
any good?
fuck .
still here , ain't i?
my turn , charl .
use the shotgun .
are you sure?
go on .
ready?
ready .
sammy?
sammy?
are you all right , son?
might start wearing one of these all the time , charl .
you should do .
it'll help you sleep better .
it's like a kick up the bollocks , charl .
it's a blinder .
here you are .
you try it .
what?
put the vest on .
sammy , what are you doing?
what?
fuck .
this is fucking madness .
i don't want to ...
oh , shut up !
here , are you all right?
kid?
are you all right , son?
come on .
are you all right?
fucking liberty .
what?
you know what .
what do you mean?
he's all right .
go on , stick him in the boot if he's moaning .
don't worry , son .
you'll live .
what's the matter?
you're off , ain't you?
it's just that ...
i'm just ...
it's all right , don't worry .
you ain't gotta explain nothing to me .
it's just , it ain't a bit of me , charl .
i ain't one of yous .
here , look , come here .
here , take it .
any time you want a holiday , you come and see me , all right?
don't , don't worry about it .
don't worry about it .
you just make sure you come and see me again .
you'll be all right , you know that , don't you?
am i?
course you fucking are .
you've got character .
anyway , look , i've gotta go and sort out these dutch cunts .
i'll see you later .
take care .
ta ta .
the way i saw it , it was go back to london and wank my life away playing donkey kong in the kebab house or sign up to a life of crime , women and drugs .
what else was i gonna fucking do?
it's eight miles straight across from morocco to gibraltar .
every night , we had one chance when the navy patrol boats were far enough apart for us to sneak our dinghies full of drugs through the middle .
and it weren't easy , our line of work .
cos you had to get up around five , have some paella , if you're lucky , a bit of shrimp , then wait for night .
we prayed for clouds so they could give us that extra bit of cover .
even then , sammy was the only one that made the call .
sometimes we misjudged the timings of the patrol boats .
and as i wiped moroccan kids'brains off me , i questioned my morals .
but with the amount of money at stake and sammy breathing down my neck , there was no time for regret .
it ain't good news .
we've lost a few of 'em .
oh , well , you live and learn .
unless you're a dead kid .
it was danny and ronnie'sjob to get the puff from the dealers ,
load up the boats with the barrels and make sure the mules headed in the right direction .
unless it was ramadan .
fucking holy month costs us fortunes , because parents wouldn't let their kids go , even when we doubled their carry money .
but we got round it .
we went to the orphanages .
sammy was the eye in the sky and everything went on his order .
he was the only one that could give the green light .
me and charlie were on beach patrol .
it was ourjob to make sure the kids didn't run off with our drugs .
they're thieving cunts , moroccans , it's in their blood .
so we'd grab 'em out the dinghies , sling 'em in the back of our van before they could run off , then we'd drive into the linea , switch lorries and send the puff off to madrid to be sealed .
the bath is empty .
i repeat , the bath is empty .
go !
go !
come on , then , you little fucking pikeys !
come on !
come on , venga !
venga !
with the dutch out the way , we changed the way drugs were smuggled into england .
we slashed the prices and drove them through the continent .
our operation grew so big , i was bringing my mates down to help .
i lived to regret it cos , like moroccans , south londoners are thieving cunts and couldn't keep their hands to themselves .
fuck frankie !
and the ginger cunt .
he looks like ronald mc fucking donald .
you shoot your mate in the foot , you can go .
if not , ronnie'll shoot you in the foot .
sam , please , i can't shoot him , he's my fucking pal .
ronnie !
all right , all right .
leave it out , dan .
i've known you since i was five .
fucking hell .
i'm sorry , mate , i've gotta do it or i'm gonna get fucking shot .
look what you made me do .
sorry , mate .
argh !
fuck !
oh , fuck .
ronnie !
leave it out , sam .
they're kids .
argh !
fucking hell !
and you , you'd get one right through the fucking nut if you wasn't charlie's boy .
the funny thing was , as my life got bigger , my world got smaller .
the more money we made , the less time we spent enjoying it .
sammy cut away anyone he didn't need .
every day above ground was a result around him .
no one was safe .
i'm telling you , fucking no one .
sam , there's a geezer out front wants to see you .
who is it?
one of the mayor's lot .
hello , english .
how are you?
what do you fucking want?
the mayor is having a dinner party at his residence this evening .
he has requested your company .
what for?
that's between you and him .
a party , eh?
we expect you at six .
it's glamorous casual .
tell your man we'll be there .
ok .
i tell my man you'll be there .
whatever .
come on .
listen , we can't exactly blank him .
we'll make a night of it .
what's fucking glamorous casuals , anyway?
i'd better dust my tux off , eh?
what for?
for the party .
no need to bother , dan .
oh , yeah , sam?
why's that?
what do you think , ron?
what's that mean?
you dropping us?
no one's dropping anyone .
but some things are for us only .
all right?
i thought we were all partners .
well , we fucking well ain't partners , ron .
you and your pal are on the payroll .
so don't start getting fucking lemon .
there was never talk of partnerships .
you both fucking knew the deal and we've looked after you .
sammy , are you fucking winding us up?
no , i'm not winding you up , ron .
ronnie , come on .
let's go .
what do you reckon?
fuck 'em .
they're gonna have to swallow .
listen , frank , this ain't like the real world .
every cunt on this coast is your pal when you're looking after 'em .
the next day , they wanna fuck you , and the day after that , they wanna be your pal again .
it's a fucking dog business .
what about you?
me?
i'm different .
fucking hell , kid .
this is where you wanna be .
three years , this'll be mine .
nice gun .
tell the mayor he's got a fantastic place here .
ask him if we can rent one of the wings .
le gusta tu casa .
dice que , " es posible arrendar un ala aqu?
lo primero que me interesa saber es qu es lo que estn trayendo en los botes aquellos?
what's he say?
he said , " thank you .
and?
he would like to know what are you bringing on the boats?
what boats?
dice , " qu botes?
dile que , en este mundo , todo se puede arreglar si uno conoce la gente clave .
he say anything is possible if you know the right people .
amigos?
amigos .
ok .
una cosa ms .
y es muy importante .
con la coca , no .
marijuana , ningn problema .
siguen trayendola , bueno .
pero , si con la coca , hay problema .
there is one thing you must know .
the cocaine .
you must never bring it onto his coast .
the marijuana is ok .
but if you sell the cocaine , it is a problem .
and if there is a problem , you lose .
buenos amigos , eh?
amigos .
ese chico me lo sientan al lado para la cena?
he's saying he would like to sit next to you for dinner .
tell him it's ok .
what do you reckon?
i think we should knock down that wall .
whatever you want .
get rid of all that spanishified shit .
i want red , black and chrome everywhere .
see that terracotta?
it's gotta go .
i want marble throughout .
my gun cabinet?
can't you put them under the bed?
that should take care of it .
now fuck off out of my house .
he means it .
now , be careful , there's a day's money in there .
go on .
and keep the change , you toby .
i think that was out , charl .
sammy , it was in .
no , that's ...
carl?
ace .
no , it was out , charl .
it was in .
it was fucking out !
don't fucking cheat !
cunt .
sammy , it was in !
i ain't playing , charl .
i ain't playing no more , charlie .
and you .
you sad fuck .
come on , mate .
with the mayor on our side , we fucking smashed it .
as long as we wet his beak and stayed away from cocaine , he loved us .
while the english police sat around scratching their canisters wondering how we did it , we opened the club for sunday lunch , sat back and enjoyed our roast . ihola !
magazine .
leave off , sam , please .
we only wanna have a bit of roast dinner .
we don't know what we're supposed to have done .
sammy , come on , it's sunday .
fuck 'em , charl , they're not welcome .
come on , sammy , sit down .
come on .
it's all right , lads .
sit down , enjoy your dinner .
don't worry about him .
come on , sit down .
come on .
oh , here we go .
oh , look at it .
cunt .
ain't got a bit of class .
thinks it's the bollocks cos its old man's warm .
i think she's lovely .
you're just jealous .
fuck off !
shut up .
what do you know?
it's just a brass .
that's rich .
charlie , frankie , come here .
come here .
i'd give a grand to fuck you , boy .
if you thought that was bad , it was nothing compared to what the chef said .
we've run out of lamb .
you're joking?
come here .
charl .
what?
see the state of these feet .
come here .
go on , girls !
wahay !
come on , ronnie !
here , you wanna sort your old woman out !
go on , love , give it the old ...
hi , charlie .
how is he?
please don't blow him out .
you all right , mate?
yeah .
you?
like my pool?
yeah , it's lovely .
what are we gonna do , charl?
can we just wipe our mouth and move on?
no .
i can't just wipe my mouth .
listen , sam , you got carly , you got your place up here .
we're moving in different directions now .
what's that supposed to mean?
it means i wanna do my own thing for a while , see how it goes .
just cos i nicked your watch for a fucking laugh?
it's not a fucking laugh , sam .
you planted it on frankie and he's my mate .
well , you've only known that cunt five minutes .
i've known you all my fucking life , charl .
don't make this difficult , sam .
i'll still be about .
i just wanna do my own thing for a bit .
don't give me them eyes .
the good thing about drugs is they make you feel good .
the bad thing about drugs is they make you greedy .
what is it?
the future .
cocaine .
pure .
what about the mayor?
fuck the mayor .
what do you reckon , kid?
good buzz?
fantastic .
my cock's shrunk and i can't feel my neck .
what's the plan?
well , i've got the colombians sweet , i've got the pilots sweet ,
i've got the drop zone sweet .
now all we need to do is get the fucking mayor sweet .
come on , kid , think .
this is worth fortunes .
how about we stick someone into the mayor?
a sacrifice .
who's gonna do that?
think about it .
he likes boys .
my mate sonny , a right skaghead in london , right , absolute fucking heroin addict .
you know what they're like when they're clucking .
they'll do anything for a fix .
exactly .
can he be got?
what a fucking amazing plan , eh?
cocaine junkie rent boys and a corrupt mayor .
and this is how it was gonna work .
flying the white from colombia straight to london was too hot by now .
so the south americans had more produce than they could shift .
that's where we came in .
they'd fly it as far as morocco and , from there , we'd switch planes and run it across the gibraltar straits like before .
but it weren't like marijuana .
we couldn't afford to lose one package .
it was worth too much .
but if our sacrifice worked and we kept the mayor sweet ... ... we'd wind up with more money than we could dream of .
ah , i'm so pleased you invited me down here , frankie .
i don't know how i'll be able to repay you .
i'm sure you'll find a way .
so , what was it you said you wanted me to do?
oh , just meet some fella .
what's he buying?
a bit of this , son , a bit of that .
usual stuff .
sweet .
you know , i'm so glad i'm clean again , otherwise i'd be in a squat in peckham with a needle hanging out my arm .
clean?
i thought you said he was bang in trouble , you cunt .
fuck it .
we'll get him drunk .
give us my wilson .
what's that?
a putter .
ow !
fuck !
sorry , i'm a bit rusty .
i see it didn't take you long to buck up with your mates again .
well , no one else wanted me .
seeing as me and ronnie are old pals and went to school together , it seemed stupid to fall out over something so silly .
why don't you fucking grow up , sam?
i wish i could , charl .
how are you two doing , anyway?
yeah , not bad .
just brushing up with my irons .
it looks that way .
here , can't you find your own fucking club to play in?
i'm a member .
hark at it .

that's what they say about you .
yeah?
it's a bit strong , innit , coming from a known grass?
fucking grass?
who did you get that from?
danny .
how come you've never done any bird , then?
cos i'm sensible , prick .
talking of pricks , how are you doing , frankie?

all right , frankie .
how are you?
shut up , you slag .
fuck off , sammy .
don't try and make a fool of me in front of your mates .
birdie .
we had more coke than we could handle .
the more we sent back home , the more they wanted it .
and by 1987 , london was covered in a white blanket .
every fucking one was at it .
from city boys to rent boys , yuppie girls to call girls .
there were even stories of the royals getting stuck in , banging it up their fucking noses .
maybe that's why she called her son charlie .
and how do you think she survived on four hours'sleep a night?
in our own little way , we were shaping the future of our country .
after cocaine , it would never be the same .
it brought us together , pulled us apart , made us sell our souls as well as our mates .
it was a glorious time .
and as long as we kept this old bastard happy and sonny did hisjob , it was never gonna end .
he say you have the face of a film star .
well , tell him , i said thanks .
and i've actually been thinking about getting into acting when i get home .
dice que gustara ser un actor .
fantstico !
dile que si quiere ser un actor , yo tengo algo que mostrarle .
he say ... if you want to be an actor , he has something to show you .
yeah?
come on , toilet .
come on .
i fucking love them colombians !
i thought it'd be a fucking bag , wouldn't you?
what for?

he whipped his cock out , so i done him in the arse .
good boy .
did he like it?
i don't know .
do you want me to stick it in yours and you can find out?
no .
no , you're all right , mate .
i'd do anyone that wants to know .
i'm gonna fuck you so good , you'll be buying me diamonds from cartier by the morning .
but as much as i wanted to , i couldn't .
it was the one thing i swore i'd never do .
everybody knows who you are back in london .
they couldn't believe it when i said i was coming to do work for you .
good for you , son .
no , i'm all right .
everyone's talking about your bar .
it's like charlie's bar this , charlie's bar that .
they love it back in peckham .
one day , i'm gonna have a bar like yours .
i'm gonna do it up like peppermint park , get all my mates down ...
shut up , sonny , for fuck's sakes !
you're doing my swede in .
the playground is full .
fly by , fly by .
charlie .
qu hace con este chulo de mierda en este huerto?
he says , " what are you doing hanging around in the orange groves with this vicious little cunt?
what does it look like?
i'm having a stroll .
dice que un paseo .
cocana .
he say ...
i know what he said .
ya te lo dije antes .
si quiere jugar bandero en buena parte , aqu no .

he warn you that if you want to play wild west on his coast ... ... it is a problem .
so , ask him what he wants .
come on , hurry up , for fuck's sakes .
i'm getting sunburn .
he says he wants nothing .

that's that , then .
hey , ingleses .

i can't bear to go back to him after being with you .
i wish i could .
i've gotta go meet these fucking colombians .
what for?
can't it wait?
baby , if i could get out of it , i would .
do you really think i wanna be standing on a hillside near estepona all night?
what time are you meeting them?
can't you come after that?
it's not till sunset .
i'll try and come and see you after .
good boy .

how the fuck did they know we was here?
i don't fucking know .
like i told you earlier ,
drugs make you greedy .
bollocks .
and we were about to blow the lot , down to cocaine .
we'd fucked with the old country .
they'd had enough .
they shut us down , took away everything we had before we could even chop out another line .
but we were so out of our heads , we couldn't even see it coming .
we were about to learn the hard way .
here you are , have some of that .
wait here a minute .
oh , what do you fucking want , you snake?
shut up , bitch .
where's ronnie?
akip !
fucking wake him , then .

we'll get the mayor out of the way in the morning .
we'll be back in business by lunchtime .
we've gotta open the club .
sonny reckons he's throwing a party tomorrow night .

for work and that .
you know what i might do next?

i reckon we'd crack it down there .
plot up , send the odd parcel home .
we'd be caked in six weeks .
fly backwards and forwards in the lear .
that's it .

but seeing as she hadn't come in a couple of years , what else did i expect?
you're a fucking ...

there was only one thing for it .
i don't know how much of this i've got left in me .

you're going to cdiz .
why aren't you coming?
it only needs one of us .
what's up?
are you fucking scared?
i don't even know where cdiz is .
it sounds like a load of bollocks to me , sitting around , waiting for fucking algerian sailors with green hats , bags of gear in run down ports .
leave me out .
qu gillipollas .
cerveza .
a funny thing .
it's a lot quieter on the way down than the journey up .
no one wants you around when you've got nothing left .
i wanted out so badly but i couldn't just walk away with nothing .
freeze !
jesus !
charl .
what's happened to you?
you all right , sonny?
you look like you've gone right to the front .
i took your old bar on , charl .
done it up like i said .
it's really cracking on .
where's frankie?
he's on his way back from cdiz .
you seen any of the others?
i don't see anyone .
not after what happened .
what about my sammy?
you hear things , but no , i ain't seen him in years .
i just keep my nut down .
if it weren't so hot , i'd say come down there for a drink .
yeah?
maybe i will .
they still want you here .
i'd give it a wide .
tell you what .
we'll have a reunion party .
what for?
what do you mean , what for?
i can pull a crowd like you've never seen before , son .
i'm not saying that .
i don't know , charl .
it's just ...
i don't know , charlie .
yeah , yeah .
that's what we'll do .
we'll get the old firm back for a night .
be fucking blinding .
it's changed down there , charl .
i don't mean no offence , but you can't just steam in .
no offence?
i ain't just fucking steaming in , boy .
that club's still mine .
well , legally it's mine , actually .
hark at him , all the long words now .
come on , son , it'll be blinding .
one little night .
for old times 'sake .
listen , you go and sort out the balloons , and i'm gonna put the word out that i'm back .
who to?
fucking everyone !
just like the old days , eh?
yeah , like the old days .
i nearly got my throat cut in cdiz , charl .
don't that tell you anything?
listen ...
get loads of balloons , pink ones .
i like them fucking massive ones with " party " written on them .
don't buy the kiddy ones , they're a waste of money .
oh , and er ... find out where sammy lives .
i want to surprise him .
the good thing about losing everything was there was nothing else to lose .
i had one last plan , one last person who could help me .
whether she liked it or not ... we had unfinished business .
so it's not just a rumour .
what?
you do look like shit .
thanks .
how would you know?
i always ask after you .
if that's true , why did you fuck me over?
you didn't need me to fuck your life , frankie .
you did that yourself .
frankie ...
i can't work you out .
i've got to go .
sammy'll be wondering where i am .
is that it?
read it .
right , let's have a look at you .
fucking hell , look at the state of you .
come here .
that's it .
that's better .
right .
you look terrific .
what about me?
ream , charl .
you look ream .
yeah .
have a look at this .
look at that .
got it?
we're still the bollocks .
come on , let's get out there .
listen , have you got the gun sorted out?
just make sure it's empty , all right?
all right .
maybe i should have driven across the border there and then .
gone through the slips while i still could .
but there was one thing left i had to take care of .
and if the plan was right , i was going to enjoy it more than the first time i got high .
did someone order a cunt?
cos one's just showed up .
listen , i've got a bit of work .
do you want in?
why shouldn't i just kill you?
cos i've got a drop lined up .
what sort of drop?
a large one .
white .
why come to me?
you're the only one that knows what they're doing .
go and wait by the gate .
carly , get me a pistol .
something i can hide .
it's got a full clip .
what do you want it for?
never mind .
give us a kiss .
frankie , listen .
i know we ain't got along too well over the years , had our ups and downs , but i really appreciate the fact that we can do a bit of business together now .
to be honest , you was the first person i thought of .
you're the only one i can trust .
i really appreciate that .
you're a good kid .
i hope this is the start of something new for us .
how much did you say there was?
lt'll be worth the walk .
we ain't got to get in there , have we?
that's where it's coming .
it's other people's shit and piss .
they won't mind .
here you are , get ready for them .
they're coming .
look .
there must be more .
i don't believe it , sam , this is it .
is this what it's come to?
i've sniffed more than this in one day .
we had it all once , sam , and it's come to this .
we really fucked it !
not me , boy .
you fucked it .
bitch !
get out of the water .
drop your weapons .
give yourselves up .
hands in the air .
the maddest thing about crime is it's like a drug .
you never know when to stop .
as much as i wanted the fairy tale ending with her ... ... i wanted it all for myself as well .
you might want to check that , what with my track record .
i just did .
what for?
you can't kill me .
you're a fucking loser like the rest of them .
trust me , if you don't pull the trigger , i'll be seeing you again .
you wish , bitch .
remember that letter my old man wrote from prison , about staying away from crime , women and drugs?
what a load of bollocks that turned out to be .
i tried the lot and won , and drove off into the sunset .
