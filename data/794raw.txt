would you just tell us?
what could happen?
okay .
i wished i could go to the wild !
the wild? !
i told you it was bad luck .
the wild?
are you nuts?
that is the worst idea i've ever heard .
it's unsanitary .
the penguins are going .
so why can't i?
the penguins are psychotic .
come on .
just imagine going back to nature .
back to your roots .
clean air , wide open spaces !
i hear there's wide open spaces in connecticut .
connecticut?
you got to go over to grand central .
then you got to take the metro north train ... north?
so one could take the train?
just hypothetically .
come on .
what would connecticut have to offer us?
lyme disease .
thank you , melman .
no , i just want ...
there's none of this in the wild .
this is a highly refined type of food thing that you do not find in the wild .
you ever thought there might be more to life than steak , alex?
he didn't mean that , baby .
no , no , no .
doesn't it bother you guys that you don't know anything about life outside this zoo?

that's just one subject .
you got a little schmutz right there on your ...

maybe you should talk to him .
go over and give him a little pep talk .
hey , i already gave him a snow globe .
i can't top that .
i can see where this is going .
it is getting late .
i guess i'm going to ...

no one will ever know .
you're joking .
right?
yeah .
i'm joking .
of course i'm joking .

like we're going to get a train .
don't do that .
you really had me worried there .
oh , well .
i guess i'll hit the sack .
yeah , me too .
i'll need to rest my voice for tomorrow .
it's seniors 'day , you know .
have to roar extra loud .
give them a little jolt .

i don't know why , but i did .
and ...

we've got a lost zebra probably on the way to connecticut , and we need ...
hello?
hello?

they'll be really mad .
it'll get marty transferred for good .
don't bite the hand that feeds you .
mm hm , i know that's right .
we got to go after him .
he's not thinking straight .
let's stop him from making the biggest mistake of his life .
he's probably out there lost and cold , confused .
poor little guy .
come on .
one of us should wait here in case he comes back .
not now .
this is an intervention .
we all got to go .
what's the fastest way to grand central?
you should take lexington .
melman !
okay .
we . " we should take lexington .
what about park?
no , park goes two ways .
you can't time the lights .
i heard tom wolfe is speaking at lincoln center .
well , of course we're going to throw poo at him .
we should've taken park .

i don't know !
that's what melman said .
hey .
hey , you , guys .
that room has some nifty little sinks you can wash up in , and look !
free mints !
this isn't a field trip .

here it comes .
what did marty say to you?
i asked you to talk to him .
i did !
i did !
i don't understand .
he said , " let's go .
i said , " are you crazy?
he says , " i'm ten years old .
and he has black and white stripes , and so then we sang and ...
what you got to do is go straight back down west 42nd .
it's on your left after vanderbilt .
if you hit the chrysler building , you've gone too far .
thanks a lot , officer .
hey !

what's the matter with them?
i feel really , really weird .

come on .
mama'll hold you .
aww , look at you .
they are so cute from a reasonable distance .
aren't you the sweetest little thing .
i just want to dunk him in my coffee .
they're just a bunch of pansies .
i don't know .
there's something about that one with the crazy hairdo that i find suspicious .
nonsense , maurice .
come on , everybody .
let's go and meet the pansies !
presenting your royal highness , our illustrious king julien xill , self proclaimed lord of the lemurs , et cetera .
hooray , everybody .
he's got style .
what is he , like , king of the guinea pigs?
i think it's a squirrel .
welcome , giant pansies .
please feel free to bask in my glow .
definitely a squirrel .
yep .
squirrel .
we thank you with enormous gratitude for chasing away the fossa .
the " whossa "?
the fossa .
they annoy us by trespassing , interrupting our parties
and ripping our limbs off .
good .
we're just trying to find out where the people are , so ...
what big teeth you have .
man !
shame on you , maurice .
can you not see that you have insulted the freak?
you must tell me , who the heck are you?
i'm alex .
the alex .
and this is gloria , marty and melman .
and just where are you giants from?
we're from new york and ...
all hail the new york giants !
new york giants !
is this some sort of inbreeding program?
i say we just got to ask these bozos where the people are .
excuse me .
we bozos have the people , of course .
hey , the bozos have the people .
oh , well , great .
good .
phew .
they're up there .
don't you love the people?
not a very lively bunch , though .
wow .
so do you have any live people?
no .
only dead ones .
i mean , if we had a lot of live people here , it wouldn't be called the wild , would it?
the wild?
whoa .
hold up there a second , fuzzbucket .
you mean , like , the " live in a mud hut , wipe yourself with a leaf " type wild?
who wipes?
oy vey .
oy vey !
oy vey , everybody !
oy vey !
could you excuse me for a moment?
get me out of here !
we got to get out of here !
help !
what are you doing? !
i'm swimming back to new york .
i know my chances are slim , but i have to try !
you can't swim !
i said my chances are slim !
nature !
it's all over me !
get it off !
i can't see !
i can't see !
i can see !
look .
there's obviously just been a little mistake .
the people didn't dump us here on purpose .
as soon as they realize what happened , they'll come looking for us , right?
yeah , right .
i don't know the words but we're born free
you know something?
i bet they're already on their way .
well , boys , it's going to be ice cold sushi for breakfast .
rico .
well , since i'm doomed to die on this forsaken island ,
i , melman mankiewicz , being of sound mind and unsound body , have divided my estate equally among the three of you .
sorry , alex .
hey !
a latrine .
nice work , melman .
outdoor plumbing .
no , it's not a latrine .
it's a grave .
you sent melman to his grave .
are you happy?
aw , come on .
this isn't the end .
this is a whole new beginning .
this could be the best that's happened .
no .
no .
no .
no .
no .
no .
no .
no .
no .
no .
this is not the best thing that's happened to us .
you abused the power of the birthday wish and brought bad luck on all of us .
why'd you tell your wish?
you're not supposed to .
i didn't want to tell you .
remember?
you guys made me tell you .
oh , okay .
besides , this isn't bad luck .
this is good luck .
look around .
there's no fences , no schedules .
this place is beautiful .
baby , we were born ...
okay .
okay .
i've had enough of this .
this is your side of the island , and this is our side of the island .
that is the bad side , where you can prance and skip
like a magical pixie horse and do whatever the heck you want .
this is the good side for those who love new york and care about going home .
come on .
no , no .
back !
back !
you know what?
this isn't good .
okay !
you all have your side , and i'll have mine .
and if you need me , i'll be over here , on the fun side of the island , having a good old time .
this is the fun side , where we'll have a great time surviving until we go home .
a yabbadabbado old time !
this side's the best .
that side stinks !
you're on the jersey side of this cesspool !
wilma !
now what do we do?
don't worry .
i have a plan to get us rescued .
can't wait to see the look on marty's face when he sees this .
just look at him .
he's helpless without us .
shut up , spalding .
i've been standing here for hours , man .
how long do i have to pose like this?
she is finito .
i defy any rescue boat within a million miles to miss this baby .
when the moment is right , we will ignite the beacon of liberty and be rescued from this awful nightmare !
what do you think?
pretty cool , huh?
how's the liberty fire going , melman?
great .
idiot .
i heard that .
why can't we just borrow some of marty's fire?
that's wild fire .
we're not using wild fire on lady liberty .
now , rub , melman .
i've been doing ...
i can't .
i can't .
i can't do it .
i ju ...
i can't do it !
fire .
fire .
fire !
fire !
oh , my
fire !
not yet !
no , no !
no !
fire !
melman , hold still !
jump !
alex , jump !
don't worry , cats always land on their ...
face?
man , what kind of cat are you?
you maniac !
you burned it up !
darn you !
darn you all to heck !
can we go to the fun side now?
everybody , calm down .
come on .
into your chairs .
everybody , calm down .
let go of his tail .
separate those two , would you , please?
you here , you there .
everyone ...
calm down , people , okay?
now , presenting your royal highness , the illustrious blah , blah , blah .
you know , et cetera , et cetera .
hooray .
let's go .
now , everybody , we all have great curiosity about our guests , the new york giants .
yes , willie?
i like them .
i like them .
i liked them first .
before i even met them i liked them .
i liked them right away .
you hate them compared to how much i like them .
oh , shut up .
you're so annoying !
now , for as long as we can remember , we have been attacked and eaten by the dreaded fossa .
the fossa !
the fossa are attacking !
it's a cookbook !
it's a cookbook !
please .
maurice .
quiet !
come on , y'all .
they're not attacking us this very instant .
we will make the new york giants our friends and keep them close .
then , with mr. alex protecting us , we will be safe and never have to worry about the dreaded fossa ever again .
i thought of that .
i thought of that .
yes .
me .
i did .
hold on , everybody .
hold on .
i'm just thinking now .
i mean , does anyone wonder why the fossa were so scared of mr. alex?
i mean , maybe we should be scared too .
what if mr. alex is even worse than the fossa?
i tell you , that dude just gives me the heebiedabajeebies .
maurice , you did not raise your hand .
therefore , your heinous comment will be stricken from the record .
does anyone else have the heebie jeebies?
no?
good .
so shut up .
when the new york giants wake up , we will make sure that they wake up in paradise .
now , who would like a cookie?
yo , al .
melman and gloria are over there having a good time .
there's room on the fun side for one more .
no , thanks .
look , i've been thinking .
maybe if you gave this place a chance ,
i don't know , you might even enjoy yourself .
marty , i'm tired .
i'm hungry .
i just want to go home .
could you just give it a chance?
think about it .
it really isn't the fun side without you .
i know .
and then ...
it's him .
who is it?
it's the pizza man .
who the heck do you think it is?
yes?
can i help you?
can i come to the fun side?
beg your pardon?
you know , i've been kind of a jerk .
but i've been thinking about what you said , and i'm sorry .
welcome to casa del wild .
take a load off .
hey , hey , wipe your feet .
alex !
mi casa is su casa .
very impressive .
hey , have a drink .
it's on the house .
this is seawater .
oh , you don't swallow it .
it's just temporary till the plumbing's done .
hey , y'all look hungry .
how would you like some of nature's goodness?
you have food?
the fun side special , coming up .
seaweed on a stick .
seaweed?
on a stick .
don't love it till you try it .
that's unbelievable .
so good .
well , thanks .
it does kind of hit the spot , doesn't it?
well , maybe it could use a little lemon .
no , it's great .
it's really great .
doesn't get any better than this .
oh , but it does .
check this out .
wow .
would you look at that .
it's like billions and billions of helicopters .
it's a shooting star .
make a wish .
quick !
ooh !
how about a thick , juicy steak?
you know what , alex?
i promise you i'm going to find you a steak tomorrow if it kills me .
thanks , marty .
it is getting late .
i guess i'm going to ...
i think i'm going to hit the sack too .
sweet dreams , everyone .
alex .
what are you doing?
twenty seven , 28 , 29 .
thirty black and only 29 white .
looks like you're black with white stripes after all .
dilemma solved .
good night .
you see , maurice , mr. alex was grooming his friend .
he is clearly a tender , loving thing .
how can you have the heebie jeebies for mr. alex?
look at him .
he's so cute and plushy .
i don't think he was grooming him .
look more like he was tasting him to me .
suit yourself , no matter .
i don't care .
soon we will put my excellent plan to action .
all we have to do is wait until they are deep in their sleep .
how long is this going to take? !
well , this sucks !
wake up , mr. alex .
wake up , mr. alex .
rise and shining .
wakey waking , mr. alex !
wake up !
alex !
you suck your thumb?
where are we?
what the heck is going on?
where's the beach?
take it easy .
who built a forest?
don't be alarmed , giant freaks .
while you were asleep , we simply took you to our little corner of heaven .
welcome to madagascar .
mada who ah?
what?
no , not whooha .
ascar .
marty .
it's ...
just like my mural back at the zoo .
oh , no , fella , that is the real deal right there .
look at that , that's not a bad view .
that's the thing that you were always looking at , but it's actually there .
that's the real version of ...
how about once around the park?
let's get our blood pumping , lungs breathing this fresh air .
who's with me? !
naw .
i don't think i could ...
you're it !
hey !
want to play around?
got you there !
come here !
you're it .
hey , stop that !
hey , you're crazy !
okay , marty , i'm it .
i'm it .
i'm it .
you win .
come on , alex , get in the groove .
i haven't eaten in two days .
my blood sugar's real low .
i just don't have the energy .
i don't think that's your problem .
first of all , that's not how you run in the wild .
let's go .
put the rubber to the road !
you just have to let out that inner lion .
now , who's the cat?
marty , i really don't ...
you are , that's who .
come on !
here we go !
that's it .
let's build up some steam !
you the cat .
who's the cat?
you the cat .
who's the cat?
you the cat .
who's the cat?
who's the cat?
who's the cat?
who's the cat?
who's the cat?
who's the cat?
who's the cat?
who's the cat?
i'm the cat !
surprise !
you're it .
you're it !
can't juke the cat .
cat's too quick .
i feel like a mile high pastrami on rye on the fly from the deli in the sky !
let's go wild !
now you're talking !
man !
i feel different .
noogie , noogie , noogie .
noogie , noogie , noogie !
kind of charged up or something .
like you said , baby , it's ...
crackalacking .
ain't that right , melman?
oh , yeah .
oh , yeah .
i'm in heaven .
you see , maurice , alex is now our friend and the fossas are nowhere to be seen .
it could be said that my plan is working in a very good working kind of way .
alex .
you got to try some of this .
i feel good .
feel like a king again .
king?
you should see his act .
come on , alex , why don't you show him some of your act .
oh .
no , i really don't think i could ...
okay .
ladies and gentlemen .
primates of all ages .
the king .
alex the lion !
e flat , fellas .
yeah !
the king is in the house !
see , if he is the king , then where is his crown?
i've got a crown .
got a very nice one .
and it's here on my head .
look at it .
have i got it on?
do the roar , man .
do the roar .
wow .
i've never heard that one before .
yeah !
go wild , man !
come on !
break out the wave !
excuse me .
you're biting my butt .
no , i'm not .
yes , you are .
what did you do?
you just bit me !
no .
i didn't .
did i?
you kind of did .
what the heck is wrong with you?
why'd you bite me?
man , it's because you are his dinner .
what? !
excuse me?
that's dumb .
come , come , maurice .
what is a simple bite on the buttocks among friends?
here , give me a nibble .
the party is over , julien .
your brilliant plan has failed .
what are you talking about?
your friend here is what we call a deluxe model hunting and eating machine .
and he eats steak ... ... which is you .
get out of here .
okey dokey , maurice , i admit it .
the plan failed .
all is lost !
we're all doomed .
the fossas will come back and gobble us with their mouths because ... ... we are all steak .
i'm steak !
me , me , me !
mr. alex cannot stay here .
he belongs with his own kind on the fossa side of the island .
by the power vested in me , by the law of the jungle , blah , blah , blah , blah ...
be gone !
what?
come on , do i look like a steak to you?
yeah !
see , i told you i don't look like a ...
wait .
what you say?
oh , yeah !
he's going savage .
run for your lives .
marty , run !
a bull's eye .
excellent shot , maurice .
thank you .
marty?
i'm so sorry , marty .
what is wrong with me?
ow .
oh , no .
what have i done?
it's true .
i'm a monster .
i got to get out of here .
what have i done?
this is a nightmare .
and it's all my fault .
now , because of me , we've lost alex .
well , what are we going to do?
we'll find a way to help him .
that's what we'll do .
okay .
come on , we are new yorkers , right?
we're tough .
we're gritty .
we're adaptable !
and we are not going to lay down like a bunch of melmans .
no , we're not .
oh .
gloria .
that was not me , okay?
that was the boat .

just kidding , doll , the people are fine .
they're on a slow lifeboat to china .
hey , i know you two .
where's that psychotic lion and our monochromatic friend?
marty?
he's righ ...
where did he go?
he was right behind us .
he went back for alex .
he's going to get himself killed !
well , boys , our monochromatic friend's in danger .
looks like we have a job to do .
embarking into hostile environment .
kowalski .
we'll need to win the hearts and the minds of the natives .
rico .
we'll need special tactical equipment .
we're going to face extreme peril .
private probably won't survive .

i'll take 300 orders to go .

but before you leave , i have an announcement to make .
so shut up , everyone , please .
thank you .
after much deep and profound brain things inside my head ,
i have decided to thank you for bringing peace to our home .
and to make you feel good ,
i'm going to give you this lovely parting gift .
no , i couldn't .
really , i can't take your crown .
that's okay , i've got a bigger crown .

maurice , my arm is tired .
wave it for me .
faster , you naughty little monkey .
by the time we get back to new york , it'll be the middle of winter .
so i was just thinking , why rush?
maybe we could make a few side stops along the way .
maybe paris .
you just read my mind .
i was thinking spain .
run with the bulls .
what about fiji?
canada .
can we?
cheap meds .
i wouldn't even mind coming back here sometime .
i could do that .
you could say that again .
skipper?
i always wanted to go to australia .
don't you think we should tell them that the boat's out of gas?
nah .
just smile and wave , boys .
smile and wave .
