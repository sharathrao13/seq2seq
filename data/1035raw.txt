i was happy ...
mm hmm .

i had a job , i had friends ...
i had a house ...
i had everything but
that steady bang , huh?
she , " the squeeze , the girlfriend whatever you wanna call a chick .
yeah , right .
and then i met her ....
this whole thing started one night at mccools
the place was packed , even my cousin carl was there , and i was in the zone
everybodys got their power base pouring drinks is my speciality
i was puttin on quite a show for the frat boys at the end of the bar
awright , who wants to take the plunge?
i want it !
awright , i know its only bartending , but hey , i m good at it
awright , folks , let's go , wrapit up .
what a setup !
you must get laid like ... all the time .
oh , yeah .
the girls are linin 'uparound the block .
fuck , i knew it !
they just can't resist a man working for tips in the service industry .
tell me !
gimme , gimme , gimme ...
y'know , carl , i appreciate your comin 'down here and gettin 'shit faced drunk , but

they got these long , long legged girls there , you can look at them and maybe touch them .
i gotta close up .
you think just 'cause i'm married

a woman after my own heart heh heh .
hun hun .
you have no idea what this woman is capable of .
i guess you don't have to worry about that anymore , do you?
i don't think of myself as the kind of person who's in this kind of office .
when i think about people who are in therapy , these are people who don't have their lives in control .
i am i'm in control of my life , my life is is in control , that is not a problem for me .
what about the woman you mentioned?
right .
uh ...
it started one night at mccool's ...
its a kind of a low rent joint
ordinarily i would never be seen dead in a place like this
hey !
who wants to take the plunge?
but on this particular night ,
karen had taken the kids to ohio to visit her mom
so i decided to dropin on my cousin , who i hadn't seen in a long time
we re talking about an adult who thinks it's fun to drink out of a toilet plunger .
i mean , this is the mentality we're dealing with here .
let's just stay focused on the woman , okay?
right .
the woman , okay
well , i look across the room and i saw
... a very beautiful woman .
i hung around hoping shed come back , but she didn t
okay , time for me to go .
it was pretty late , and i d had a few drinks
and there she was
i'm just a little bit nervous .
how do i look?
she was with this guy , and i thought maybe this is not the best time to hit on this particular woman
what is this , pms week?
so i got in my car and
i don't know , i started to doze off a little , and i hear all this screaming and cursing .
don't touch me , asshole !
i'm gettin 'out !
hey !!!
wow .
tits .
fuck you !
and you didn't try to help?
oh , i would have .
but?
i may have fallen asleep .
you should know
i was practically forced into this .
jewel?
jewel?
i , uh ...
i suppose it's not gonna help
if i tell you that was really amazing?
i know it was .
that's the problem .
to tell ya the truth ...
i only took one psychology course in junior college ,
i know there's supposed to be this thing where you're sad or you're guilty after ...
well , i personally don't suffer from that .
it's not that .
don't you see?
that guy tonight
oh oh , that creep in the firebird?
i know that guy .
of course you know the guy .
let's face it , you're not the type of girl who just jumps into a car with some smelly guy that you don't even know ,
i know that .
no ....
he and i are ... doing this ... thing .
oh , shit , i really like you .
what do you mean by " thing "?
he and i get in this fight , and then you or whoever comes to my rescue and takes me home , and then ...
he like shows up and we rob you .
what?
we rob you .
i mean , do you believe that?
i'm shocked .
i i take it this is something that you you've done before?
just a couple of times .
i know it sounds sick , but you don't know utah , he's nuts .
how does he know where we are , anyway?
i'm supposed to call him and tell him .
you you haven't done that yet , have you?
of course not !
oh , good .
good ...
um ... okay .
i got it .
don't call him .
let's call the police instead .
not if you ever want to see me again .
oh , right .
y'know , i generally think better with my shoes on , so ...
this guy utah , is he a mormon?
uh , i wouldn't say that .
oh .
i didn't think so .
you know , this guy ...
he sounds like a ma jor piece of shit , you know?
you wouldn't be talkin 'about me , would ya , loverboy?
wh why didn't you call?
i was just about to .
has this guy got anything worth takin '?
old tv , a vcr .
he's got a boom box , but only one speaker works .
a mr coffee machine .
telephone , um ...
oh yeah , and one light hooked upto the clapper .
hey , that was my mom's .
shut your fuckin 'mouth !
you stand there , you call me a piece of shit !
huh?
i'm the piece of shit?
i'm here with my lady , you understand?
it is a touchy situation !
has he got a car?
no .
no?
he's pathetic !
you you don't got a car?
everybody's got a car today
even bums don't not got a car !
what do you do when you take a chick out , you go on a bus?
think you're gonna get laid on a bus?
think you're gonna give some chick the fuckin 'monster on a bus?
huh?
i got a car ...
the " piece of shit's " got a car !
what about jewelry , has he got jewelry?
just a swatch
nice leather band , though .
oh yeah?
take it off .
c'mon , you're so slow .
it's right over here .
awright , you're up , slugger , let's go .
you want me to open it?
no , i want you to dance with it
move !
okay .
and if there's a gun in there , just leave it .
'cause you'll pull it out , you'll get nervous , you'll wind upmiss in 'me , then i gotta do what i gotta do with what i got .
look at me .
look at me when i talk to you !
i can't look at you and look at the safe at the same time .
oh , excuse me , okay .
you're the big shot now , i'm nobody , right?
okay , i'm over here now .
excuse me .
got any other features on this watch?
it's got a stopwatch .
it's got a stopwatch?
i never figured out how to use it .
it's simple , it's this button
oh ....
what happened?
he was gonna kill you .
really?
i mean , he was just
he could definitely tell that there was something going on between us , y'know?
how?
because i've never actually slept with any of the other guys that i've done this with before , that's how .
is he dead?
oh , jesus .
do you hate me now?
no , no , no , no .
no .
oh yes , you do !
no , it's not that , okay?
it's just the sex and the violence all in one night , it's a little much .
what are we gonna do now?
what?
what are we gonna do now? !
i don't know !
well , think of something !
let's call the police .
that's a good idea .
yeah?
yeah , really .
and what are we gonna tell 'em?
we'll tell them the truth ,
i mean , that he was robbing you and and i shot him , and that's that .
yeah .
tell 'em the truth .
i like that .
uh , since he was threatening you ,
i probably won't get more than ten years , right?
and with good behavior
i could be out in seven ... years .
wait ...
um ...
let's come upwith another plan .
what?
i mean , that he was robbing you and somebody else shot him?
who?
well , we could say that i shot him .
that won't work .
it's ridiculous , it would never work that way , it's
well , maybe ...
well , i mean , let's ...
let's go over it .
okay .
he was robbing the place .
yes .
he did get shot , right?
mm hmm .
so that's two out of three .
what's that , that's sixty seven percent true ,
i mean , that's pretty good these days , right?
right .
that's some first date , killin 'her boyfriend .
well , it gave the relationship a certain intensity .
it all started one night at mccools
earl raymond pitts .
had a list of priors goin 'back to the womb .
seriously .
he was born in dwight correctional .
his mother had twins while she was doin 'a bit for narcotics .
you mean there's another one out there like him?
huh .
yeah .
he went by the name " utah .
utah " ...
the mormon state?
yeah .
don't ask me .
i'm a little unclear on this .
he was holding a gun on you ,
but you were able to get your gun and shoot him point blank in the back of the head?
yeah , right .
it it all happened kinda fast .
so ... he was standing in front of you , and then ... what?
he heard something?
right .
he turned around , you grabbed your gun ...
right .
which was where?
uh ...
hidden next to the safe?
right .
just in case something like this ever happened .
he turned around , you grabbed your gun , and pow !
exactly that's exactly how it happened .
about what time was this?
huh?
about what time was this?
oh , uh ...
just before i called 911 .
thanks .
hey .
it's res ponsible citizens just like yourself that make my job a lot easier .
you can imagine my mood , getting roused from a sound sleep to go scoopsome citizen off a barroom floor
you wanna talk to the lady?

nah , she was waitin 'for him back at their house , he didn't show , she got worried , came here lookin 'for him .
let her go .
awright .

i can't have people comin 'in here
lokin 'for a good time , seein 'you and thinkin ',
uh oh , that's the one
that put a bullet in the guy's head .

yeah?
hi , how ya doin '.

what's this?
1 800 mattress .
i didn't order any mattress .
dammit !
how are we supposed to pay for this stuff? !
god , randy , i just thought we really had something , or at least the start of something .
but obviously i'm incredibly stupid .
you're not stupid .
i'll be out of your life in just a few minutes .
i didn't say i wanted you out of my life .
ha !
it's just ... with the ironing , the the new mattress , they all just seem like things that are a little further down the line , that's all .
further down the line than all the sex we've been having?
any further down the line than killing utah together?
you're right ... you know what , it's me .
i lost my job today .
you what?
i got canned .
oh , baby , why didn't you say so?
aw ... are you okay?
i guess .
oh ....
mmm ....
oh , your cousin called .
the lawyer .
we're going over to his house on saturday for a barbecue .
so carl invites me over to his house for a barbecue .
now , carl never invites me over , so i'm thinkin 'to myself , why now?
here you go .
that's sweet .
thanks .
that is some ma jor league pussy .
ha ha ha !
i meant that in a good way .
you bangin 'her?
she must have fucked you senseless when she found out you shot a guy?
because i read that women cream for the violence .
i don't know what that is .
when you're fuckin 'her , though , because she's so young , is it
i'm gonna see if they want some helpin the kitchen .
i'm just asking .
i mean , look at her !
it's like havin 'a porn star in my house !
except she's makin 'salad .
you have such a beautiful house it's so homey .
that's all karen , believe me .
i wanted to go with lots of stainless steel , something we could just pssh !
hose it right off .
a lot of this stuff we don't even use , so if you really like it , take it .
thank you , jewel .
it's always been my dream to have a real nice house .
i already know exactly what it'll look like
wall to wall carpeting with matching drapes , and a big , fluffy white couch , nice dining room set , and in the corner ... a fountain .
a fountain?
it's gonna be ...
it's gonna be great .
it's of a little girl washing her hair and the water runs off into a giant sea shell with goldfish swimming in it .
i didn't just make it up , i saw it in a magazine .
better homes and fountains?
carl !
hey , randy , you got a fountain in your place , don't ya?
in the living room
oh no , that's a leaky toilet .
my mistake .
you know what , carl?
you're not funny just rude .
let's get together some time .
that's a good idea .
bye .
hey , c'mon .
mmm ....
okay , okay !
ha ha ha !
okay .
why don't you let carl run you home?
no , i'm afraid that's where your luck runs out .
i can't drive , i've been drinkin '.
would you buy a car?
one of these days .
make him buy a car , would ya?
let's go catch that 4 : 15 bus ,
let's get the hell out of here .
buy a car
i wish he hadn t put that idea in her head
what's this?
oh , a friend of mine's goin 'away for a little while ...
so she said i could borrow it .
well , what happens when your friend gets back?
we're gonna be used to havin 'a car by then .
so?
then we're gonna have to buy one .
so?
it's a bottomless pit of expenses !
you got in surance , you got repairs , car payments
you're just afraid because now you don't have an excuse for not finding work , aren't you?
stopright there , this has nothing to do with work .
did you know it's safer to fly than it is to drive a car?
you're upset with me
because i didn't bring you home a plane?
another thing , if you think
i'm gonna be out there with a hose and a bucket of suds to wash the damnthing , you can forget it i'm not that guy .
well , fine .
i'll wash the car .
god , you're full of shit .
what's that?
i'm full of shit?
yes .
lemme tell ya i have seen people
leave the bar so drunk they can't even see , and off they speed in their giant sports utility vehicles .
well , you run into one of these guys out on the street , and you're gonna die , and you're gonna die ugly !
would you relax?
christ , look at this house !
uh ...
i come at a bad time?
uh , no .
and then that damndetective dropped in
as if i wasn t stressed out enough
i'll let you two talk .
what'd he want?
oh , you know , he's a cop .
they're never satisfied unless they ask you everything ten times .
after that night at mccool's i was a mess .
i couldn't concentrate ...
i couldn't sleep ...
i could barely eat .
nothin 'deep fried , anyway .
i had this longing ...
something inside of me said i had to see that woman again
boy , was i glad i got there at that exact moment
he was getting very abusive
you're gonna die , and you're gonna die ugly !
it was like i had been chosen for a very special assignment
not by the department , but by a higher power
i was being sent to save her from him
oh ...
did i ... come at a bad time?
uh , no .
didn't seem possible , but she was even more beautiful than the night i first saw her .
and i said , good afternoon , then she said , i il let you two talk
then he said
not bad , huh?
there was something about him i just didn't like .
according to your statement , you closed the bar at one thirty .
you didn't call to report the shooting until three fifty eight .
i need to know what you were doing during that time frame .
haven't we already gone over all this stuff , man?
hey , uh , jewel , how about crackin 'me open a brew , huh?
i don't know , it was , uh ,
i had to count all that money ,
it was a busy ass night , awright?
i think on this night we had those frat boys in there , and a couple of 'em
whoa , whoa whaddya doin '?
this guy's a cop .
he can't drink , he's on the job !
why don't ya do somethin ', y'know , make yourself useful .
all right .
i'll be outside was hing the car .
yeah , you do that .
man , i'm sorry about her .
how can i not question our creator for putting this ... ... human obscenity into the presence of such a ... ... divine creature .
anyway , that was the night we had all these frat boys in and they're taking " the plunge .
a couple of 'em ended upin the bathroom and barfin 'up all over the floor ...
i wasn't listening to a word he was saying
i could only think about her
i felt so guilty ,
like i was betraying the memory of theresa but i couldn t take my eyes off her
# well i think it's time #
# to get ready #
# to realize just what i have found #
# i have been only half #
# of what i am #
# it's all clear to me now #
# my heart is on fire #
# my soul's like a wheel that's turning #
# my love is alive #
# my love is alive #
# yeah yeah yeah #
# whoo ! ##
can you imagine how i felt?
you should see what she does with my hose .
i don't know what would make me invite him over for barbecue .
you did say you were going to .
hmm?
yeah , but
i say a lot of things .
why do you think you did?
i don't know .
you tell me .
the woman?
you know , he brings her and shes wearing this nothing of a dress , its a slip !
i mean , you can see everything
for a barbecue .
no , no , wait a second , what am i thinking?
hot pants .
they re like cupping everything , and and this top
you could definitely see her stomach
wait !
no , no no sorry , it was a dress .
it was a dress , like a , like a summer kind of farmer girl dress , you know?
with like , cherries and plums and
okay .
little fruits .
shes walking and shes bouncing and the grapes and the melons , and they're just ba boom , ba boom
that's fine , thank you .
she's so sexy , but pretty !
okay , all right !
no !
all right !
that's enough !
i get the picture !
let's just go on with the story .
so then
in any case , the reason i called you was you're one guy i can trust in a situation like this .
i got a guy with a hole in the back of his head where the exit wound was ...
# oh were you just pleased to see me #

um , would anybody care for another burger?
i'll have a hot dog .
if you have one .
and then she grabs me and she says ,
lets get together sometime
so she was coming on to you?
yeah .
it doesn't surprise me , really .
it doesn't .
no , 'cause
i mean , i don't mean to sound full of myself , but ...
but what?
you're irresistible?
women ... women find me attractive .
do you think i'm attracted to you?
well , you're a doctor , so i think you have that professional reserve .
but even so ,
i think i felt something when i walked in the office .
it's okay , don't worry about it .
you don't wanna hear about all this .
no , no , no go on , go on .
you got the car , you're feelin 'good about yourself again , and boom !
the sex picks up again , right?
well , not exactly .
i was watchin a lot of cable
randy !
randy .
can we talk?
sure .
what did you do all day?
i'm watchin 'this norwegian movie again ,
maria marushka
it's really good .
randy ..
i think not having a job is starting to get to you .
no .
it's not having any money that's starting to get to me .
well , that is why i think we need to talk .
with what they pay me at the store we can barely cover our bills , not to mention the new dinette set i want , or the window treatments i want in this room .
well , i'm sorry , there's not much more i can do .
i mean , nobody seems to be hiring .
that's why i went to mccool's today and spoke to your old boss , joey .
what !
you didn't go down there and and beg him to give me my job back !
of course i didn't !
good .
but i am going to the moody blues with him .
what?
tomorrow night .
he seems to think they're the second coming , but they're really not my cupof tea .
wait a minute !
why are you doing this?
i'm doing this for us as a couple , randy .
and more importantly , i'm doing this for you and your sense of self worth .
huh?
i think that you have a lot of anger towards joey , and that because of that , you feel less of a man because of his power to take away your livelihood .
you think i'm gonna have less anger and feel like more of a man if you start dating this guy? !
no .
i'm suggesting that tomorrow night when you know he's at the concert , you go to his house and you steal everything of value you can fit into our car .
you're joking .
no .
i mean , come on , the guy fired you .
and he still owes you six hours overtime , right?
i just don't think he knows what he had with you .
you're so wonderful ,
you're the best bartender i've ever seen , by far .
you know , the way you worked those crowds , you really had 'em in the palm of your hand .
you know what you reminded me of?
what?
a rock star .
really?
really .
i don't know ...
i just ...
i don't see myself doing something like that .
it's crazy .
once we fence all his stuff , we'll make a pretty nice chunk of change .
look , forget it !
there's no way .
absolutely not .
but you did it , of course .
yeah , i did it .
i knew joey would have a big cd collection
and i was surprised at all the other cool stuff he had
you know , jewel must have taken a few more psychology courses than me , because as crazy as i thought the whole idea was , as reluctant as i was to do it , by the end of the evening , i felt great
i still wonder how she talked me into it .
here's a wild guess .
yeah .
that probably had somethin 'to do with it .
# i got money in my pocket #
# i've got lovin 'in the air #
# there is nothin 'that will stopme #
# and i really just don't care #
# i just want to live my life #
# that's the way it's gonna be #
# and nothin's gonna pull me down #
# 'cause you know that i believe #
# the sun's gonna shine #
# shine #
# it's gotta be love from the very start #
# it's gotta be love from the very start ... ##
jewel?
the indian stays .
i wasn't gonna throw him away .
for a while there , we almost seemed like a normal couple
you re slammin it night and day , poppin 'your cork like a bartender at a mob wedding , then one day , like it always happens , all that good nookie turns sour on ya .
yeah .
what are you doing?
oh , nothing .
trash .
ah ah ah .
randy , come on , we have to throw some things away .
but not my sno globes , come on !
can't we just compromise and throw one sno globe away?
jewel , these came from my mom .
see this one here?
she brought it back from chicago .
see , it's got the sears tower here , and this one here is very special .
ya see , my mom used to say that this was our house , and as long as i never broke it , we'd always have a place to stay .
i knew s he was only joking , but still ...
you're a sick puppy , man .
so what kind of job do you have at this point?
i hadn't got one yet .
it was sort of an ongoing problem between us .
i 29 , i 2 9 .
i was offered the lunch shift at tgl friday's ...
you lucky stiff .
i actually thought it was kind of a stepdown from unemployment , i mean ...
no , you got it , you won i 29 .
oh yeah .
um ..
uh , bingo .
we have a winner !
i gotta be honest with you , my young friend .
i'm leaning towards the girl on this one ,
i mean , she's made your dump nice and livable , you're gettin 'good action on the mattress ...
hold onto it till you cash out .
least you could do is make some money .
maybe you should be playin 'bingo .
that's why ... we decided to do another ... you know , break in .
what do you mean , " we "?
yeah , jewel and me ,
i mean , i'm no criminal .
i bet he's got a dvd .
i'd love to have one of those .
whoa .
we're going to montague's , so i borrowed something from the designer section at the store .
i just think you might have overshot ,
i mean , even for montague's .
really?
yeah .
you know ... ... maybe we shouldn't be doing this .
the burglary?
yeah .
oh , randy !
joey's is one thing , but this is something else .
would you be happier if we weren't?
sure , wouldn't you?
i'll show you what makes me happy .
these are all pictures from magazines , things i've saved .
things that i want in my house someday .
i've been carrying this thing around with me for years .
whenever i feel lonely or get depressed ,
i just add in a new couch or a new set of drapes and ...
i don't know , just dream .
it makes me happy to think that someday
i might actually live in the kind of house that looks like it belongs in a magazine .
you want me to be happy , don't you , randy?
of course i do .
so who was it this time?
just some guy
god knows how they met
they were going to some fancy restaurant , montagues
jewel was sure she could keephim there for at least three hours
it was a good thing , too , because it was gonna take a little time to clean this guy out he had everything
at first i couldn't find his dvd player , and i really needed to , since jewel wanted one
so i went upstairs , and there it was
dvd !
bingo !
him again? !
you gotta be careful when you say " bingo " in here .
not to worry , that was a false alarm .
sorry .
it was like some game show where they send you on a shopping spree
i found a nice new rolex much nicer than my old swatch .
unfortunately , this guy was i guess a midget
and then things started goin wrong
what's this?
this is the place where it all happens , baby .
come on .
mi casa , es su casa
greg !
i thought we were going out somewhere !
why go out , baby?
we got it all right here !
best sound system you ever heard , a little hot tub , swimming pool ...
the gregster might even break out his secret stash of blow .
uh , greg ...
uh , i thought , uh ...
why don't we just drive for a little longer , this car makes me so hot !
i'll leave the front door open if you wanna follow me , okay?
greg?
score !
oh , shit !
greg?
greg?
greg !!!
randy !
i had a feeling you'd find your way .
this is a nice house .
too bad you're such a shit .
heh !
a little dirty talker .
okay , okay , come on , let's talk .
why don't we go downstairs and have a drink?
i have a better idea , baby .
let's talk after .
bitch !
come on , baby , come on !
get off me !
ha ha !
bitch .
you like it a little rough , huh?
oh , yeah , you wanna play?
we'll play rough .
we'll play very
ungh !
oh , my god , i don't believe this .
what is it with you?
everywhere you go , there's a dead guy .
take the dvd .
take the dvd !
i'm not takin 'the dvd .
why not?
well , i don't know , it just does n't seem right .
it was all right before?
before there wasn't a dead guy iyin 'on the floor .
y'know , i never saw a dead person till i met you .
the guy was trying to rape me , does that mean anything to you?
now take the dvd !
i'm not takin 'the dvd !
don't you want to live in the type of house that has a first rate home entertainment center , including a dvd?
i already got his big screen .
i don't see the difference between taking his big screen or taking his dvd i want that dvd .
'cause the big screen is already down in the car .
i get all dressed up ,
i get a friggin 'shiner ,
i don't get dinner , and i don't get the dvd
i didn't care about the tv ,
i was just doin this to make jewel happy
but you didn't take the dvd .
a local attorney was found slain this morning ...
i do not believe we were in that gazillion dollar house and we didn't end up with a thing .
did you forget about the dead guy on the floor?
no , i did not forget about the dead guy on the floor , but we're not talking about him right now , we're talking about the dead guy on the floor's stuff , and he had a lot of stuff , stuff we could have taken if you weren't such a chickens hit .
what's that?
so now i'm a chicken shit , is that it?
yes , i believe that's the technical term for what you are .
yeah , well , i'd rather be a chicken shit than whatever the hell is it that you are .
i'm the woman living with the chicken shit .
not for long .
yeah , not for long , that's right , because i need a real man , someone i can count on , not a chicken shit like you .
ah , good , company .
thus far , police have no leads ...
it's that cop !
aren't you glad we don't have a lot of stolen stuff iyin 'around now?
you're a genius .
hi .
morning .
thought you'd wanna know we closed the investigation on the shooting at mccool's , no charges will be filed .
we're gonna let you slide on the unregistered gun
'cause it was self defense .
thanks .
everything okay , ma'am?
yeah .
sure .
those are some pretty nasty bruises .
huh?
oh yeah , she had an accident .
accident?
would you mind if i talk to her for a minute?
sure .
alone?
okay .
at the time , i was glad jewel was gonna talk to him
she knew how to handle the cops , what to say to get rid of em
she was good that way
whatever happened in there , she doesn't want to talk about it .
that's 'cause nothing happened .
what we do in these domestic violence situations is ask you to vacate the premises .
what domestic violence? !
i will go to a judge who will issue a restraining order which means you are not allowed on this property
this is my house !
or within 100 yards of your wife until this matter is settled .
she's not my wife !
that's too bad you'd have more rights if she were .
you expect me to just walk away?
if you don't , i'm afraid i'm gonna have to arrest you .
you can't be serious !
this this can't i just talk to her?
i don't think that would be wise at this time , sir .
whatever she told you , she's she
it's not true , y'know , okay?
hey , jewel , honey , could you come out here , please?
i could still book you on the unregistered gun .
hun !
jewel !
would you be kind enough to tell the police officer that i didn't hit you !
would you please tell the officer that i didn't do anything to you?
don't make me use force , sir .
jewel !
jewel !
i couldn't believe it
i was so pissed at her i thought i was gonna explode
well , i gotta admit , she's not perfect .
not perfect? !
she's like this pure , delicate flower ,
i just wanted to protect her .
but , uh , she was living with another man .
that piece of slime? he didn't deserve her .
and you did?
i don't know .
oh , charlie .
i was totally cons umed by her .
my every thought was of her .
i was walkin 'around in a haze .
people talked to me , but i didn't hear what they were saying
gregory potter spradling .
a lawyer at ragsdale , hersch & klein .
what did he do?
do "?
for a living .
lawyer .
ragsdale , hersch & klein .
it doesn't make sense .
why would you go to all the trouble of stealing a big screen tv and leave a dvd behind?
poor guy
the only thing goin through my head was her
everything okay , ma'am?
yeah .
sure .
those are some pretty nasty bruises .
would you mind if i spoke to her for a minute?
knock yourself out .
charlie , what is it?
why would god fill me with this desire
if i wasn't meant to be with her?
sometimes some time apart is the best thing .
i could arrange that .
would i get to stay in the house?
a temporary restraining order would keephim way for ... 90 days .
but permanently?
you'd have to get a lawyer .
do you know one?
yeah .
i know one .
she called you?
yes i didn't call her .
she tells me things are going badly with randy , so i thought maybe i could helpher out and introduce her to one of the guys in my office .
in fact , i did , i once introduced her to this other attorney ,
greg , who's this ... ... guy who was murdered .
anyway , she just knew that karen and i were having problems .
were you?
yes , you could say that .
sexual problems?
hey , you know ...
okay , if you want to label it , yeah .
but i'm not saying it's karen's fault .
was it your fault?
maybe it was karen's fault .
was there sex between you and this woman?
yes .
you want it now , lawyer boy?
yes !
yes , please !
oh , my god !
oh , my god !
oh , my god !
what happened there?
wh why'd we stop?
what?
i need to ask you for a favor .
anything at all anything !
um hmm , um hmm .
i'm gonna need some legal advice soon .
you got it !
you got it .
you aren't just saying that?
you got it .
you want this?
you like it?
can you helpme?
anything !
say it !
i will give you legal advice .
say it !
i will give you legal advice !
say ... it !!!
i'm saying , i will give you legal advice .
yeah?
whooah !
she whipped you?
yes .
with a whip?
yes .
and you en joyed it?
yes .
charlie i spent so much time going by her house , ifyou didn't know my intentions were pure you d think i was stalking her
hello .
hi .
i looked for any excuse to go see her
i spoke to a friend of mine about helping you with keeping the house .
oh , good .
thanks .
i , uh , i just wish i had known a bit sooner .
see , i already sort of contacted this other lawyer .
well , if you'd rather use him
it's just that i'm not sure if i can get my retainer back .
well , lawyers
they'll always try to find a way to screw you .
yeah .
well , i i better
i , uh  yeah?
i was making some supper ...
if you'd like to ...
it's nothing special .
surely this was the hand of god .
how do you mean , charlie?
in an instant i was transformed from a broken man , made whole .
it was like theresa had been brought back to me
she even looked like theresa
the way she moved ,
the way she smiled
# her skin is like velvet #
# her face cut from stone #
# her eyes when she's smiling ... #
can i helpyou with that?
no thanks .
i'll be right back .
she even made linguini with tomatoes and onions
like theresa used to
linguini with tomatoes and onions .
jeez .
what's that?
oh nothing .
probably just a cat got into the garbage .
bread?
thanks .
how come you never wear a uniform?
i'm a detective .
sometimes i do , it depends .
i bet you look real good in it .
i couldn't wipe the goofy smile off my face
i was so happy
because of her i lost my job ,
i lost my house ,
i'm an accessory in not only one , but two murders .
shh !
i couldn't stopthinking about her
okay , maybe i wasn t allowed on the property , but that didn't mean i couldn t keepan eye on her
and then she did something that sent me over the edge
i knew i had to do something something drastic to salvage what little i had left
i got the ten thousand .
bingo parlor , right?
yeah .
the code is ,
i say , " it looks like we might get some rain " ...
we came upwith a code .
i said , " looks like we might get some rain "
yeah , yeah , i know this part .
yeah , right .
you slept with randy's girlfriend? !
i mean , it's not like i never did anything for him .
he called and he needed ten grand , so i advised him for free ,
i advised him how he could borrow against that old crappy house his mom left him .
you're missing the point .
how did you feel after you slept with your cousin's girlfriend?
he's not even a cousin , really ,
he's my uncle's wife's brother's kid .
so he's not a blood relative or anything .
did she ever call and ask for legal advice?
no .
no .
i keepwaiting .
it's like she's teasing me .
i'm dying to give her legal advice .
i just seem to be thinking about her more and more
excuse me .
there's a police detective here to see you about greg .
sure .
thanks .
sorry about the mess ,
i'm in the middle of changing offices .
how well did you know greg spradling?
uh , not that well , we worked here for the last four or five years .
you were both upfor the same promotion , weren't you?
no , not
not really .
greg was a good guy
no disrespect for the dead
not really partner material .
so no matter who i'm talking to , she's just she's on my mind .
can you think of anything that might be useful to us in our investigation?
sounds to me like he picked upsome rough trade .
who knows what happened?
there could have been ... ... leather .
there could have been some bondage ...
maybe those spiky things ...
maybe some whipping .
could have been pretty kinky .
but we all know what that's like , right?
no sir , i don't .
that's how much she messed me up .
i mean , i'm being investigated for a murder , and all i can think about is her .
and the whip?
yes .
there was another reason i went to see her that day .
something had come up at work
the shoeprints we found on winfield road turned out to be converse all stars , the same brand the boyfriend wore
and if he was there , there was a chance she might have been
i had the same sick feeling in my stomach that i had when i was waiting for the results to come back from the lab at the hospital
unfortunately , her print did match one at the murder site
that scum , that boyfriend of hers
there's no telling what he forced her to do before i came along i wasn't going to let her get dragged into a murder investigation
i knew she had nothing to do with it
there's something i have to ask you .
is it an inside question or an outside question?
there was a burglary last week on winfield road .
a man was killed .
was she able to convince you that she didn't have anything to do with it?
she was very convincing
it was a miracle !
# the way you move #
# your sexy body #
# it makes we want to get to know you #
# a little bit better . #
sex? !
oh
there was sex?
god helpme , it was wonderful .
no , for me to helpyou ,
i i need to hear everything .
see , you have to tell me all about the the various acts of physical congress between
i already told you that .
okay , no , that's fine ,
i'm not it doesn't
i shouldn't have done that .
it's okay , i wanted to .
are you going to arrest randy?
i've got a warrant out for him now .
that car he's driving is stolen .
add a murder charge to that and you won't see him for a long time .
so i'll get to keepthe house .
this ...
this is all i have left .
how not perfect can one woman be?
aces in the boink department .
got yourself a snazzy new watch .
like this is supposed to make everything better?
but you gotta admit , that's a beaut .
here's the money , just take it .
take it .
take it !
shh !
kid easy , easy .
would the owner of a blue geo metro
missouri license plates 87kp03 please report to the front desk .
is that my car?
you got any idea what they want?
no .
is there any possibility that she might have
stolen?
yeah .
i want to remind everyone that saturday is " hawaiian night .
she gave me a stolen car .
women are much more complicated than we think they are .
c'mon , let's get out of here .
we'll get back to the game as soon as the troopers finish their business .
sir , is this your car?
that piece of shit?
officer , what do i look like?
you know , to tell you the truth , she doesn't sound worse than most of 'em .
but you'll do it , right?
business is business .
# a wanted man in mississippi #
# a wanted man in old cheyenne #

i withheld information for a murder investigation
charlie , look

the kind of happiness that a ... ... a good woman can bring a man .
oh ...
yes , i have this great job and this great office and this great family and this great house
how does this make you feel?
empty .
i feel nothing .
and who knows , it happened so fast .
i mean , here's this guy in my office

i could walk out of your office and get hit by a truck .
i don't want to live like that anymore .
let me just feel something , anything , and then i will look up and i will say ,
thank you , god .
thank you for that gift .
and ... then if the truck wants to get me , then okay .
and then i meet this woman .
she makes me feel ...
thank you .
oh ...
i'm sorry .

i was expecting her here any minute !
why do you think i'm dressed like this , for halloween?
you're dressed like that because your perverted cousin

you are violating a restraining order and are under arrest !
you don't understand .
someone is coming here to kill her !
him?
huh?
no .
which one of you homos killed my brother?
i'm not gay
shut up !
i understand the man that killed my brother , utah , he lives here .
and i'm not leaving 'till i kill him .
now , which one of you was it?
i said , which one of you was it !?
i i i'm an attorney .
i'm sure you and your brother were very close that's good .
avenging his death , wanting to avenge his death , that's admirable , who doesn't understand that?
but as a lawyer ...
what the hell?
you want to explain to me what you're doing
looking through the window of my house?
give me your gun .
i lost my dog , uh he came off his leash .
and you need a . 357 for that?
well , it's a rough neighborhood ... ...
jewel .
you should know that .
look at these guys .
legally , you're swimming against the current here , but you've got think about the fact that if you kill all three of us , you will be adding here , and i'm just guessing , a second and possibly third strike to your record .
which would be heading you to some very serious prison time .
you i'll kill just for annoying me .
now , i would appreciate if the man that killed my brother utah would stepforward and take responsibility for their actions , or i will have no other choice than to kill all you dan ... ... village people !
now ... somebody better damnwell start talkin '!
aaah !!!!
aah !
lord , please don't let them find me in this outfit !

when i'm on the road a few days
i really miss my place .

nothin 'i like better than stayin 'home on a quiet night watchin 'a good movie on my dvd .

if you're gonna have a first rate home entertainment center , you gotta have a dvd .
not that my place doesn't need some fixin 'up .
hell , i was even thinking about putting in a fountain .
