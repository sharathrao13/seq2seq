castlegard .
clear !
250 .
250 ready .
clear !
300 .
300 ready .
clear !
he's gone .
it's over 100 degrees out there .
he grabs me with ice cold hands .
apart from external wounds , everything is out of alignment .
even his veins are out of alignment .
now , wait .
look at the heart .
the aorta doesn't line up .
and now the spine .
same thing .
same shift right across the third vertebrae .
this guy looks like a paper doll got cut up and pasted back together .
no wallet .
no ld .
just this thing around his neck .
it says ltc on it , so we called them .
that outfit in the desert .
our biggest contributors .
excuse me , gentlemen .
frank gordon , ltc .
i'm here to pick up vince taub's body .
i'm dr. cova .
i'll take care of that paperwork .
thank you .
vincent taub , huh?
that's vinnie's good luck charm .
thank you .
pretty sad when your time comes and no one claims you but your employer .
excuse me , sheriff .
sure .
gordon .
i'm picking up the body right now .
was he alone or with decker?
taub's the only one here .
get the body out of there .
and x rays and records .
get everything , ok?
will it be a problem?
no , there's no problem .
they've been very accommodating .
if this gets out , ltc is ruined .
any idea how he ended up in the desert?
i don't know .
maybe he used his marker without enough clearance .
it could be a million things .
not too bright .
he's dead , robert .
taub is dead .
oh , mr. gordon , by the way , what's castlegard?
i heard that's the only word he said , " castlegard " .
sounds like an amusement park .
listen up , class .
april 4 , 1 357 .
castlegard , france .
the english army in their red uniforms occupied the village of castlegard .
the french , meanwhile , were advancing , trying to drive them out of there , in this direction over the river , past the monastery and up and over to the heights here .
just leave it , chris , that's fine , before you wreck the place .
the english army , meanwhile , had retreated to castle la roque .
well fortified , very strong , very well supplied , and both sides had settled in for a long siege .
the french were trying to push the english out of france .
lord oliver tries to take the fight out of the french .
now , he has a prisoner , a woman .
a woman of class and a woman of nobility ,
commander arnaut's sister , lady claire .
he hangs her from the battlements for all of the french forces to see .
instead of demoralizing the french , it whips them into a frenzy , and they attack the castle like madmen , and they overpower the english with sheer passion .
so the fortress of la roque fell in one night because of the death of one woman ,
lady claire .
all right , that's enough of the academics for today .
go get your hands dirty .
hi , chris .
hey , dad .
i got marek's clippers .
oh , chris , great .
thanks .
here , hold that , will you .
you can move it around if you like .
i thought this would be a routine trip .
it is .
last time you cut off your beard , you sold the house and we moved to kentucky for a year .
your mother wanted a change .
how does this always happen to me?
i am older and very much wiser than you .
have a beer .
it'll cool you down .
very hot work , ironing .
i know something's going on .
the beard's coming off , so what's really happening?
it's these amazing finds we've been making .
doniger's been giving us too many tips .
he's a lucky zillionaire .
nobody's that lucky .
he knows something he's not saying .
something isn't right about this .
he's been ducking me .
i'm gonna get a few answers .
maybe scrounge a couple of bucks .
put that in my bag , would you?
and don't wrinkle it .
i'd appreciate it if you don't tell anybody about this .
especially kate .
why would i tell kate?
here .
have a wee run round that , would you?
why would i tell kate?
you see me twice a year , stay until you're bored to distraction .
i think the record's three weeks .
maybe i'm just really beginning to enjoy archeology .
from a boy who hated easter because he had to find eggs .
yeah , because you buried the eggs .
that's beside the point .
yeah , because you buried the eggs .
that's beside the point .
you're still here because of kate .
chris .
look , son ,
i love you , but you're scorching my shirt .
sorry .
you and kate are from different worlds .
you saw how that turned out between your mother and me .
yeah , but , dad , no offense , i'm not like you .
but kate is .
trust me , if it's between archeology and you , you'll lose .
sorry .
i'm sorry .
i brought you a beer .
that's so sweet .
half a beer anyways .
half a beer .
what you got going on here?
the stairs .
the ones you were talking about?
where do they go?
now they don't go anywhere , but they'll lead me to my tunnel which will go all the way to la roque .
what do you say i help you out?
show me what to do .
i thought you hated this stuff .
no , i don't hate it .
let's have a beer .
i need a break .
you have the full one .
that's sweet of you .
cheers .
cheers .
thank you .
you're welcome .
think you'll follow in your father's footsteps?
no .
no .
no way .
actually , i'm not really all that interested in the past .
no?
what are you interested in then?
i think i already know the answer to that question .
i've been hoping that you'd notice .
i've been hoping you'd quit hoping i'd notice .
so there's nothing there?
chris , you are the boss 'son .
so ... there is something there .
it's late .
i'll just start on this tomorrow .
but thanks for the beer .
haven't been practicing , have you?
i'm not getting any younger .
you love this stuff .
it's a habit i can't quite kick .
let me take that from you before you cut something you'll need later .
so talking about love ,
how did it go last night?
it didn't .
so how does it feel being passed over for 600 year old ruins?
it sucks .
it sucks big time .
i don't understand you guys .
you live in the past .
you know what the past is to me?
the past is why my parents split up .
the past is what i've been force fed since i was little .
none of you archeologists looks to the future .
what are you talking about?
what is the future but just more of the same?
more gadgets , more machines like that thing you rode up on .
it's the past is where it's at , you know .
people then , they cared about each other .
men had honor , you know?
no , no .
you know what that is to me?
romantic warrior crap .
romantic?
you want to see romantic?
follow me .
come on .
come on !
what have you got?
oh , another stone sticking out of the ground .
no , it's a 600 year old sarcophagus with a french knight and his lady .
look , isn't she beautiful?
she's a real knockout .
very funny .
another thing , down here , they're holding hands .
lncredibly unusual for that period .
that is kind of unusual , huh?
oh , god , over here .
this knight has only got one ear .
what happened there?
what , one ear?
that piece is missing .
it's somewhere here in the dirt .
i'm the archeologist .
it was carved that way .
fair enough .
trust me .
who do you think they were?
why would somebody that doesn't give a shit be concerned with that?
because i'm intrigued , all right?
see?
what you wanted to hear?
yeah .
we're all intrigued by this .
that's why we're all here .
it's not just about the rocks and the rubble .
it's about these people .
who were they?
and what were their stories?
it helps us to understand where we came from , or where we're going .
you know what i like to say .
" you make your own history .
do i say it that often?
yeah , all the time .
well , whoever they were , they made theirs together .
it's best to go really , really slow .
it's better to be cautious .
come on .
hurry up !
cave in at the monastery !
cave in at the monastery !
i was standing and the floor gave way underneath my feet .
how long has it been open?
1 5 minutes .
we have five minutes before oxygen contamination .
let's move it .
be careful .
it's under where i was working .
i don't know about this .
can everybody listen up?
let's be careful , we got that?
i've got your back .
be safe .
who's going in first?
ok , let's go .
who's going down first?
i am .
on belay !
on kate !
ok , take me down nice and slow .
give me a radio check .
please be careful .
ok , one two .
do you read me?
we're good .
that's good .
just keep it steady .
lower kate down .
lower me down .
easy , guys .
nice and slow .
nice and slow .
i'm getting close to the first level .
easy !
bring me down , guys .
a little more on marek .
smell the stale air .
kate , be careful down there .
i'm down .
oh , my god .
this is right below where i was working .
are you all right?
what's going on?
all right? " " all right " is not the word .
one ...
give me slack on the rope .
more slack !
come on , guys .
oh , my god .
this is unbelievable .
we are the first people in this room for 600 years .
these ...
these ... ... are beautiful .
you won't believe the condition of these ...
what have you got?
come here .
no way .
this is too much .
oh , my god .
what is it?
oh , my god .
an old document box .
we've got an oilskin with documents inside .
look at the condition of this thing !
ok , let's be really careful .
quick , get the bag .
i can't believe this .
that is gonna be such a find .
careful , careful , careful .
let's get this up .
i need the light for a minute .
oh , my god .
oh , my god .
oh , man !
give me the light .
what kind of ...
it's amazing . ... son of a bitch would deliberately damage something so beautiful?
obviously not an archeologist .
we've gotta get out of here .
let's go !
guys , we're coming up !
pull it up !
come on !
we want to go up quick , ok?
hold this .
what are you doing , marek?
it's ok .
what are you doing?
it's definitely a modern day bifocal lens .
i know .
and bifocals weren't invented until the mid 1 700s .
the hole only opened up today , stern .
there's been nobody down that chamber before kate and l .
if you think that's weird , you'll love this .
what is this?
one of the documents you found .
it's just a simple list of the things stored in there .
nothing special .
and then we found this .
look .
the professor?
help me "?
e. a. johnston "?
" 4/ 2/ 1357 "?
1357 .
e. a. johnston .
what is going on?
i cross matched the signatures .
it's definitely his handwriting .
but he's only been gone for two days .
your father wrote that , but he wrote it 600 years ago .
what's going on here?
francois is looking for his spare pair .
i'll see if the prescriptions match .
so you're telling me this is the professor's and it's 600 years old?
what have you been smoking?
maybe you can explain .
if i knew , i'd explain it .
all i know is that the ink is 600 years old .
i know .
this is my father .
this is him .
he's just playing a prank .
no !
no , there is no way he would risk contaminating the site as a joke .
he just wouldn't .
did you carbon date the ink?
of course .
there's got to be another reason .
i did it three times .
like i just said , your father wrote that note , but he wrote it 600 years ago .
i don't care about ltc's policies .
i'm his son , i wanna talk to him now .
i found the professor's glasses .
they were on his desk .
it's a perfect match .
look .
we should do an optical test to make sure .
i'm sick of this .
either somebody tell me where professor johnston is or i report a kidnapping to the authorities .
have i made myself clear?
just tell us when and where .
what is it?
doniger's sending a plane for us .
we're going to new mexico?
let's pack up , guys .
good morning .
steven kramer , ltc .
frank gordon , security .
where's my dad?
you'll see your dad shortly .
where's doniger at?
doniger's waiting inside .
mr. kramer will explain everything .
tell me .
how come we have a 600 year old document
with his handwriting?
pleading for help .
i'll explain as soon as we get through security .
itc is constantly advancing itself in science .
30 years ago , the business world was revolutionized with a machine that sent documents anywhere with the push of a button .
doniger's vision was to do that with 3 d objects .
like a fax or something?
exactly .
he's trying to send actual objects from one place to another?
follow me .
but that's impossible .
he would need a quantum computer with millions of processors .
we used them to build a machine that could fax three dimensional objects .
i'll explain these mirrors later .
it would put fedex and ups out of business .
you actually made it work?
yes .
across a room .
but we wanted to send things across continents so we built a bigger machine .
this is the prototype .
the prototype?
so that thing that we just passed ...
exactly . ... is the real thing?
we gave it a thousand times more power .
we tried to send something from new mexico to a twin machine at a lab in new york city .
now , here's the interesting part .
the package never arrived at its destination .
a few hours later , it showed up back here .
wait a minute .
so if it went missing between new mexico and new york ,
where did it go in the meantime?
we asked the same question .
so we sent out a camera over and over , and we got back photos of the same location , a hillside with trees .
that's when mr. doniger made the brilliant decision to point the camera straight up .
so once we cross referenced star charts to the horizon , we realized that the camera was not only in the wrong place ,
but it was in the wrong time .
so , what does that mean?
the camera was taking photographs of a wilderness near castlegard , france in the year 1 357 .
so you're saying you accidentally discovered time travel?
no , we accidentally discovered a wormhole .
1 357 , castlegard .
so you faxed my father's glasses and documents back to the 1 4th century?
no , chris .
your father is in the 1 4th century .
what?
we need you to help get him back .
mr. robert doniger , this doesn't make sense .
a wormhole is a volatile force .
you can't send a person through one .
can't fit a piece of paper through a telephone wire .
but you can send a fax .
sure , once you've broken the message into a stream of electrons , but ...
oh , shit .
now , look ,
i don't care about the hows or the whys .
i care about my father .
did he know about all this?
i thought we could help each other .
we'd give him hints
i thought we could help each other .
we'd give him hints about the best excavation areas , and he could discover why we're locked into this particular place and time .
so this is why you've been funding our dig .
he was more astute than i thought .
we gave him too many clues and he became very , very suspicious .
how could you send him there?
god knows where he is ...
oh , he's a very persuasive man .
he insisted on going .
now he's stuck .
that's where you all come in .
do we look like wormhole specialists?
you sent the professor to the hundred years 'war?
right .
turbulent times you sent him to .
we need cultural experts , not scientists .
my people don't know about the medieval world or how to mingle , which is what we have to do if we are to find the professor and bring him back .
so we bring him back , it's that simple .
we step on that machine and whiz back to 1357 to get him back?
once he's broken us into a stream of electrons .
why should we do what you ask us?
i think we need to know more ...
i know you have a lot of questions ...
a lot of questions .
the professor's already been gone for 72 hours and every minute he's there , it'll be more difficult to find him .
that's true .
bob?
excuse me .
i need to get them changed if they're going to go .
frank , change with them .
i'm not going .
gomez and baretto are ready .
we need to think ...
i'd like you along .
we didn't say we were going .
steve , can you bring them to prep , please .
sure .
folks , this way .
thank you .
please , this way .
thank you .
just follow steve .
he'll take you to the prep room .
bob , look , gomez and baretto are my two best men .
they can handle any situation .
i would prefer not going .
i really want you to go .
and if you see decker , you know what to do .
robert ...
you know , that was a really great speech you made .
i almost believed it myself .
didn't you forget something?
what?
come on .
look at taub's mrls .
look at his arteries .
this was his tenth trip .
this is their first and only .
they deserve to know that we don't know how he ended up in the desert .
you don't think they deserve to know that?
i've told them enough .
how did my father get stuck back there?
doniger gave him an hour .
things got harried , and i lost him in the woods .
you left him there .
we have a limited time .
i had to come back or we'd both be stuck .
i guess it's better him than you , right?
listen , there's a few things we have to go over before we leave .
they need your vital data .
it's for your return process .
change from your clothes into those clothes over there .
anything you want .
put your personals in the lockers .
i want to introduce you to two friends , bill baretto , jimmy gomez .
they're coming with us .
buddies from the marines .
why do we need marines?
just in case something goes wrong .
i like to have all my bases covered .
all right , let's change up .
i can't believe you're considering this .
do you understand what it does?
it strips you down to a molecular level , which means , for a moment , you cease to exist .
listen to him , he's got a point .
hold on !
wait a second .
i don't need you , miss ericson .
or chris .
i need you .
you know the layout .
nobody knows it like i do .
i go .
there's no way i'm not going .
i just said i'm not going , so don't touch me !
thanks .
stern , we don't need you back there .
you're a physicist .
your knowledge won't help us .
i'm sorry .
but we are going to need you , francois .
why do we need him?
because he speaks french fluently .
he's right .
my high school french sucks .
don't do this .
we need his help .
i'll cover you .
don't pressure him .
francois , you have to make your own decision on this .
your father would've done it for me , so , yes , i'll come .
ok .
yes .
thank you .
thank you .
magnetic coils ready .
verifying now .
platform up .
computers are up , mr. doniger .
tell gordon we've got to get going .
keep a couple of beers cold for me , all right?
mr. stern .
watch our backs , ok?
it will be all right .
we'll be back before you know it .
take it easy , bro .
you know the 50 bucks i owe you?
all right , let's move it .
frank , six hours and the clock is running .
wear these personal markers around your neck .
you can use any one of them to call for your return .
frank will explain their intricacies once you arrive .
most importantly , one marker will bring all of you back .
do not lose them .
what about weapons?
nothing modern goes back .
especially weapons .
they're set for a six hour countdown .
countdown?
they burn out after six hours .
and then?
i'll get you back before you know it .
oh .
sorry , francois , they didn't have these back then .
i don't see without ...
you'll be fine .
that's where we goofed with the professor .
i feel morally compelled to inform you that there is a degree of pain .
i'm told it's rather intense , but extremely fleeting .
a couple of seconds .
no residual discomfort .
so forgive me , i didn't want that to influence your decision .
ok .
good luck .
let's do it .
you all look great .
miss ericson , you look divine .
good luck .
don't worry about it .
you guys will be home for lunch .
think of it as the ultimate field trip .
a fantastic thing for an archeologist .
i can't believe we're doing this .
slowly .
there are no railings .
josh , come on down .
come watch .
josh , come on down .
come watch .
yeah , i'm fine .
take a place around the perimeter .
spread out .
move around the platform .
take a deep breath , relax .
we'll be back before you know it .
are we set?
all systems check .
come in , josh .
close the door .
good luck .
six hours and counting .
mr. marek?
mr. marek , i need you to take your position .
how's everybody doing?
what the hell are we doing?
getting the chance of a lifetime .
nothing to worry about .
we'll take care of you .
just relax .
everything will be fine .
dna streams locked in .
thank you .
ok , lock them in .
locking in .
how long does it take?
a couple of seconds .
watch it here .
mirrors locked .
son of a ...
where is he?
francois !
are you all right?
where's francois?
francois?
there he is !
francois !
pull him out !
now we wait .
give me your hand !
come on !
francois , hold on !
hold on !
hold on !
here , take my hand .
you all right?
you all right?
everybody all right?
that was a close one .
all right .
let's head up this hill .
everybody follow me up .
hell of a start .
we've always arrived on land .
gordon , is this it?
i think so .
you think so?
are we in 1357 france?
this could be oregon .
gordon , where are we?
shut up !
trust me , we're in 1357 france .
well , if this is france , i'm home .
come on , let's go .
let me explain the markers .
press here , it shows the remaining time .
squeeze it , it takes you home .
but don't .
why?
we haven't found his dad yet .
one last thing ...
he said , " hide " .
everyone hide .
all right , take cover .
let's go !
move !
now !
francois , come on !
well done , sir de kere .
after him .
yes , my lord .
get the others .
find out who they are .
come on , quick .
oh , god !
baretto !
we got a field buck !
they're coming back !
oh , my god .
get a medic !
get a medic up here !
what was that?
what was that?
what?
what is that?
that's a grenade !
get down !
oh , my god , he's left .
get down !
he'll see you !
you !
over here !
let's go .
come on , come on !
all right , let's go .
come on .
chris !
kate !
marek !
hey .
where's my boys?
where's marek?
the guys came after baretto .
he took some arrows and then he pressed his marker .
he's gone .
he took two arrows , and he must have hit his marker .
where's gomez?
i didn't see him .
oh , my god .
don't look .
what are you doing?
oh , shit .
i can't find his marker .
you're looking for his marker?
he's dead !
what are you doing?
i'm getting us out of here .
we're not going anywhere .
we can't save anyone if we're dead !
keep it quiet .
you can't do that .
why not? !
you need 40 feet of clearance around all sides to work .
what?
i was trying to tell you .
don't lose these .
they're precious .
and if you follow my lead , i will get your dad and get you home .
francois , it's going to be ok .
let's find marek .
what about gomez?
we can't do anything about him now .
we gotta go .
look at me .
francois , come on .
be quiet !
the soldiers !
you passed us .
you passed us in the woods .
it's ok .
it's ok .
we've lost the trail .
damn it .
pick it up again .
yes , sir de kere .
search down by the river .
jesus , you're a girl .
it's ok .
after the french bastards !
after them !
leave none living !
careful .
there you are .
no .
help !
help !
shut it off !
he knew not to take anything modern .
that son of a bitch brought a grenade back with him .
i can't believe it .
the coils .
the coils .
damn it !
he knew the regulations , no modern weapons !
gomez?
the lines are online !
well ...
his marker .
what happened to the rest of them?
get a medic over here !
i don't know .
give me your gloves .
well , did anyone try to come back with him?
i don't know .
i know as much as you , ok?
hang on .
what if they're trying to come back now?
it's not gonna happen ...
don't jump to conclusions .
you can't leave seven people stuck back there !
tell me you have a backup plan ...
shut up !
i don't know .
i don't know .
please tell me you have a backup plan .
yes , we have a backup plan .
go !
gordon !
gordon !
it's marek !
chris !
this frenchwoman will lead us to castlegard .
great .
that's great .
let's go .
come on .
wow .
the village of castlegard .
we're here .
where is everyone going?
hold on a second .
what day is this?
marek ...
it's the fourth of april .
of course it is .
it's april 4th .
1357 .
the day la roque falls?
wait , wait .
what are you talking about?
you son of a bitch .
excuse me?
you brought us back on the day the french attack .
by tonight , this whole place is gonna be burned to the ground .
stop with the history and look for the professor .
now , follow me .
let's go .
i'm a physicist .
give me something to do .
i can help .
might as well be a pharmacist .
good one , robert .
replacement panels are on their way .
how long will this take?
five hours and 27 minutes .
how do you know it's gonna take 5 hours and 27 minutes?
because that's all the time we have .
once this platform is fixed , even if the markers run out , we can send someone back to get them?
the thing holding the wormhole open is their markers .
but you've opened and closed it dozens of times .
once the platform ...
look , we don't even know what we did to link us to this wormhole .
a lucky calibration , chance impurity in the coils .
the point is , the grenade probably destroyed any possibility of re creating it .
once their markers expire , they could be stuck there forever?
is that what you're saying?
they could be .

that right section , i had wrong .
where did that tower come from?

yeah , you're right .

my lord !
pick him up .
come on , my friend .
who are they?
we captured them in the village .
i am lord oliver .
who speaks for you?
i do , my lord .
you speak strangely .
yes , we are scottish , my lord .
scottish?
you've come to kill us all in our beds?
first the old man and now this group .
why do the scottish find this village so pleasing?
it must be your lord's kind manners .
lndeed it must .
my lady .
i beg your pardon , my lord .
let him speak .
my lord , the old man you spoke of ...
edward de johnness?
he claims he's a magister .
do you know of him?
he's our master , sir .
all is well with him?
he said he was alone .
we were several days behind him .
he does not know we are here .
who are you?
yes , you .
the one whose head is touching the ceiling .
francois , my lord .
a frenchman .
hold .
please .
please .
we're all gentlemen here .
he's our interpreter , sir .
forgive them .
i'm at war with the french , as well as the scottish .
have i forgotten anyone?
the spaniards , am i at war with them?
arnaut has sent many spies into my midst .
no , he's not a spy .
no?
he's our friend .
i'm sure he is .
he's too tall to be a spy , anyway .
lnterpret .
be quiet .
interpret .
i'm a spy .
i'm sorry , i didn't quite catch that .
it means ...
be quiet , francois .
... i am a spy .
my god , it's a miracle .
a quiet frenchman .
did you hear that?
no .
louder , boy !
come on !
i am a spy .
i thought so .
oh , my god !
get rid of the frenchman .
put them with the old man .
we may need them .
who's next?
no !
no , chris !
don't !
don't !
oh , francois .
francois .
inside !
up !
move it !
move it !
no !
don't push me !
hey , leave her alone !
move it , ease on !
all right , you bloody scottish !
hold on !
i'm moving !
over here , andre .
this way .
come on .
my marker .
guys , i lost my marker !
don't worry , we only need one marker to get home , ok?
this can't be happening .
careful with the rest .
those bastards killed francois .
professor .
professor !
kate?
yeah .
kate .
oh , my god , kate .
are you all right?
oh , my god .
you got my message .
chris , your dad .
chris is here and marek's here .
dad?
son .
dad .
chris , my son .
glad you're still alive .
oh , god .
what happened?
you've lost such blood .
it's not my blood .
it's francois '.
he's dead .
oliver had him killed because he's french .
this guy had a sword and he just ran him through .
professor , what happened?
i was trying to avoid the english , but they found me in the monastery .
i convinced oliver i was a magister on my way to dublin .
i skipped shakespeare .
what is a magister?
it's a scientist .
he accused me of being a spy .
how did you survive that?
i promised oliver a new weapon .
what kind of weapon?
a liquid fire so intense that even water couldn't harm it .
greek fire?
you promised him greek fire?
professor , i'm sorry , have you considered what you may have done?
you've given the english a serious advantage in this battle .
they're supposed to lose the war !
i was alone !
marek , marek !
i'm sorry , i'm sorry .
you're right .
the point is , when these guys come here , and take us up to la roque , when they seal that place off for battle , there is no escape .
we're as good as dead .
no , we gotta get out of here now .
wait , wait , wait .
remember that field where the peasant huts were?
that's the closest place with enough room to use the marker .
how do we get there?
we have to do it fast .
we've got four hours .
four hours is plenty .
the way i see it , we've got 650 years of knowledge on these guys .
there's no reason why we shouldn't be able to get home in 20 minutes .
ok , let's find a way out .
let's look around .
there's a hole here big enough to climb through .
quiet !
ok , all right .
she was with the group we caught earlier , my lord .
may i ask why you're trespassing on my land?
come , come .
what are you doing?
i'm gonna scale down the wall .
when it's clear , i'm gonna let you guys out .
all right .
you're not going anywhere .
what?
i am , i'm ...
marek , i'm the best climber .
i am the best climber .
if anyone should be going , it should be me , but those roof slats won't hold me , or you , or you , chris .
no , no ...
wait .
wait .
but they might hold you , kate .
now , kate , this isn't a game .
are you prepared to take a life?
i'll do what i have to do .
there's no way .
you're not going anywhere .
it's going to be all right , ok?
there's one thing worse than dying here , and that's living here .
i refuse to do either .
i'm going .
it's ok .
she's right .
kate .
please , please take care .
hey , it's easy .
it's gonna be easy .
chris , i need your help .
come on .
i need you to hold that back and keep it open .
all right?
kate , be careful .
ok , here i go .
easy .
there's guards there .
i'm gonna go up and over .
there's a window on the side .
ok , watch yourself .
i got you !
i got you !
hold on !
hold on .
i got you .
don't let go .
are you ok?
i've got a foothold .
we're gonna pull you back in .
no , i'm good .
ok , please be careful .
i've got to keep going .
you , man !
gather those children and move !
all clear on the outside .
hold your line , men !
in position !
too much ale .
we'll play again when i get back .
keep them quiet .
what the ...?
now !
grab a weapon !
let's go .
chris !
very sorry .
we're heading out the way we came in , all right?
marek?
marek !
yeah , yeah .

i'll take the rear .
all right , let's go !
kate , we gotta go .
oh , be careful !
let's go !

he's got his marker .

his name is de kere .

we're not going without marek .
i don't give a shit about marek .
my job was to get the professor .
i can't take care of you .
i lost gomez , baretto .
you guys are on your own .
or follow me .
let's go !
to the river , quick .
we have a field buck .
somebody's trying to come back .
how strong?
it's minimal .
what does that mean?
it means they're still alive .
halt !
come on .
come on .
where is he?
where's gordon?
where's ...?
there he is .
there he is .
i saw him .
come on !
wait .

chris !

ok .

oh , shit .

people are looking .
there's no time .
listen .
listen .
everybody is looking .
be quiet .
kate , hit your marker .
press yours .
i'm not going without marek .
hit your marker .
you're not going anywhere .
marek's got his own marker .
search every building and every farm !
oh , shit .
kate , press it .
we can come back for marek .
press it .
we've been here too long .
press it .
it's not working .
it's not working .
i know how to do this .
why isn't it?
i don't know .
if it were working , we'd be home now !
everybody , walk away slowly .
let's find a place to hide .
infantry , spread out .
search the huts !
search everywhere and capture them !
oh , by the way , my name's andre marek .
castlegard was your village , wasn't it?
don't worry , you'll return there soon .
no .
the english will burn it to the ground before they move to la roque .
no , la roque will fall too .
yes .
but it will take many more lives and many months of fighting before it happens .
the french built that fortress .
we know how strong it is .
la roque will fall tonight .
only a prophet ... or a fool could make such a claim .
in your case , it's probably the fool .
whichever makes you smile like that .
are you ... married?
no .
we've been fighting the english since before i was born .
there's no time for marriage .
of course .
are you with ... anyone?
am i with anyone?
yeah .
i'm with you .
i know , i know .
what i mean is , is there someone ...?
is there someone that you see?
do i see?
yeah .
nobody .
it is possible they are hiding on the shore or in the woods .
they could be anywhere .
oh , god .
you know , it's funny , but we're speaking the same language , but you don't understand anything i'm saying , do you?
get them !
no , no .
it is good .
they are french .
they will help us .
you're lady claire .
lady?
i like that .
it's charming .
dame claire .
fire !
fire !
find them !
i killed that man .
i've gotta live with that .
in here !
we found them !
we found them , my lord !
over here now !
come on !
don't let them go !
come on !
go inside !
go around the back .
shut up and move over there .
come on .
burn it .
no .
no , you can't do that !
don't .
chris , please get out of there .
chris !
chris !
my son's in there !
chris , get out of there !
hold your man .
no !
no !
all right , come on .
come on .
chris , wait up .
come on .
wait up .
claire !
arnaut .
he is very grateful you returned his sister ...
you're english .
no , i'm scottish .
arnaut , he saved the life of one of your men .
you're scottish , huh?
yes .
in that case , i do not know how to express my gratitude .
well , you can .
just keep her close and keep her safe .
i can take care of myself .
yes , that's obvious .
please , do not let her out of your sight , especially tonight .
do not worry , she will be well protected .
i must leave .
i must return to castlegard to search for my friends .
i need to ask you perhaps for a horse and a weapon .
you will not make it alive through the english lines .
they are moving from the village to la roque .
we attack tonight .
you must not go back there .
i must try and find my friends .
i'm sorry .
very well , i will give you what you ask for .
thank you again .
thank you .
lady claire ...
claire .
i wish we had met at another time .
andre marek .
are you married?
no .
arnaut?
arnaut has dismounted , and he's with his sister .
well done .
in fast , kill arnaut and out .
and may god be with you .
all right , i have to get inside la roque and find my dad .
you'll never make it through .
i'll find a way .
there is no way .
you'll get killed .
oh , jesus .
go , go .
i don't have a choice .
yes , you do .
there's another way .
what , the tunnel?
yeah .
you never found it .
you don't know it exists .
there's always been a rumor .
yeah , but that's a rumor .
my dad's life is on the line .
all of our lives are on the line .
look , if that tunnel ever existed , it's going to exist now , 1357 .
i know it's in that monastery .
i know it .
i wanna save your father as much as you do .
you have to trust me .
i know it's there .
i know it .
you've got to trust me .
stay in line .
move along .
keep the pace !
kill arnaut !
claire !
claire !
claire !
move along !
come on , lads .
that's marek !
marek !
marek !
i'm ok .
it's chris and kate , marek .
what about chris and kate?
they didn't make it .
they've killed them .
what?
been a while , hasn't it , frank?
oh , my god .
i thought you were dead .
right , that's why you sent taub to assassinate me .
not to assassinate you , to bring you home .
right , just like you are .
no , look ...
listen .
listen to me , will .
i need your help .
what's this?
look , it's not working anyway .
it says here you got less than one and a half hours left .
it doesn't work .
bullshit .
look , you've got to believe me , it wasn't my fault , ok?
i've got a family .
yeah?
you've met my family .
you got a family?
you have a family .
i've got a family .
so did l !
no !
no !
no !
no !
oh , shit !
oh , my god !
last time i saw him , he was running with his marker for an open space .
i was on the ground , three arrows in me .
i used to be william decker , ltc employee number 273 .
now ... ... i'm sir william de kere , lord oliver's aide de camp .
you looked pretty impressive today , marek , for an academic .
how do you know my name?
i know all of your names .
we read every report out of your dig before we made the first trip back .
how many times have you been here?
enough to know transcription errors intimately .
transcription errors?
doniger , that son of a bitch .
he hasn't told you a thing , has he?
what are transcription errors?
mistakes in the dna reconstruction process .
it's like faxing a fax .
distortions .
mistakes .
only the distortions aren't in the letters .
it's body parts .
the organs .
i've gone in too many times .
i'll never survive another trip .
all that damage , it can be repaired , but not here .
and not in this time .
you'd have to go back .
why don't you press the marker?
we can all go home , decker , huh?
my name is de kere .
this is my home .
lord oliver awaits his greek fire .
after that , your survival depends on your knowledge of history .
how good you make me look .
i rise in favor , so do you .
i fall , you fall .
i fall , you fall .
marek , where's your marker?
de kere , decker , whatever his name is , he took it off me .
oh , god .
we're friends of edward de johnness .
edward de johnness .
the magister .
he's my father .
the englishmen have harmed him?
we don't know .
we were gonna ask for your help .
yeah , we need your help .
come .
we need to hurry .
we don't have much time .
lord oliver demands a demonstration before nightfall .
it would be best not to miss the deadline .
they've done it .
the stuff's all there .
this stuff's a bit coarse , but it's good .
what am i talking about?
i can't do this .
i can't give them greek fire and influence the course of history .
i may already have done that .
what do you mean?
when we first arrived here , we were helped by this girl who took us up to castlegard .
in fact , that's who i went back to get when we escaped .
that girl turned out to be lady claire , arnaut's sister .
are you serious?
yeah .
i've delivered her to the french for safekeeping .
she's incredibly important .
her death rallies the french to win .
don't you understand?
keep it down , ok?
now we have to be on oliver's side just to stay alive .
this is exactly where i was digging .
this is it .
this is the place where ...
we're here .
we're ...
what do you mean?
this is the chamber where i was working .
i'm sorry , what did he say?
the army of arnaut is ready to attack .
we're running out of time .
those are the stairs .
it's under here .
move them up here .
there's a goodly number of trebuchets , my lord .
what's a little fire to these stone walls?
there's nothing down here .
this is it .
this is the chamber .
this is where the hole was .
we came down here ...
there's nothing here .
marek would've been working there .
the box would've been ...
oh , my god .
that is the box .
that's the parchment he wrote on .
my father's glasses .
yeah , we've got to go .
no , no , put it back .
if we don't find this , in the future we're never gonna find your father .
put it back .
we still gotta go .
we gotta get up to la roque .
no , the stone relief was damaged .
somebody had damaged it .
what kind of son of a bitch would damage something so ...
it was me .
it was me .
i was the son of a ...
what is she doing?
wait !
get back !
stay back !
watch out .
watch out .
oh , wow .
it's the tunnel .
it's the tunnel !
give me a torch .
hey , give me that one .
kate , watch out .
let me go in .
get arnaut?
yes , get arnaut .
go .
please , hurry .
hurry .
kate , get in here .
oh , whoa .
you got it?
yeah , i do .
careful , boys , this is greek fire .
you can blow us all to hell here .
smooth and easy , now .
no spills .
that's good .
trebuchet !
trebuchet !
trebuchet !
trebuchet !
shit .
you ok?
yeah .
hurry , there's no time .
trebuchet !
trebuchet !
trebuchet !
bring water !
lord oliver , the magister with your demonstration .
oh , yes , i'll see it now .
understand , my lord , i've never ...
show me now !
show him !
your fire of the greeks .
marek , fire it !
ok , come on , let's move it .
trebuchet !
just fire the damn thing !
i cannot fire it .
fire it !
fire !
ready , fire !
out of the way .
move .
let me pass .
that's it?
so you betrayed me .
you promised me greek fire .
i should have had you hung ...
what?
with your permission , my lord .
the more water , the more fire .
good .
better .
my god , you are a magician , not a magister .
i want this for every cannon .
how many men will you need?
twenty .
twenty .
give this man 20 men .
as you wish .
this way , magician .
archers to the battlements !
archers to the battlements !
archers to the battlements !
we have 81 % .
no , no .
it's over .
i'm not gonna play with their lives like this .
we can't get 100 % efficiency from patched together coils .
what's the safest minimum percent?
we've done successful tests at 80 % .
you just said we have 81 % .
they were inanimate objects .
with reflectors up .
how much time do we have?
28 minutes .
no room for error .
they could be deformed .
can we?
yes , we can .
it's too risky .
you think i'm gonna let you leave them?
think i want to?
i don't think you care .
they have a chance , some kind of life .
no , you lost the chance for that decision a long time ago .
this is no longer your decision .
you know what?
it is and i have .
i'm sorry .
fire the moat .
yes , my lord .
fire the moat !
light your arrows .
light arrows .
archers , prepare .
archers , prepare .
stretch .
stretch .
away !
night arrows .
night arrows .
a little surprise for the french .
ready !
stretch .
away !
we're close now .
we're close , i know it .
great .
well done , my lord .
trebuchet !
one more of them , and we become history .
oh , no .
no .
we're going .
forward , right maybe .
maybe it's just ...
or we could go up , right?
we could go up .
kate ...
no , don't .
no !
no !
kate .
no .
kate .
maybe we missed something .
maybe we made a wrong turn .
we could ...
it's too late .
it's just too late .
i said trust me , and i've let you down .
and i've let your father down .
and ...
i've let everybody down .
no .
oh , god , i'm so sorry .
no , you didn't .
kate , come here .
kate , come here .
come here .
come here .
close the inner gates !
close the inner gates !
this is growing tiresome .
the courtyard is secure , my lord .
good , but this frenchman needs to be put in his place .
it's time .
captain !
it is time !
robert .
thirteen minutes left .
let's try and get them back .
are we gonna go over all this again?
what are you doing?
what the hell do you think i'm doing?
i'm protecting our interests .
what's happened to you?
how many lives are lost on the cutting edge of discovery?
it's the price for great advances .
these were kids , not astronauts !
i know !
they had no idea !
even worse when they're deformed !
you know the media .
they'll twist it around and label it a " death machine " .
it has a serious flaw !
and you'll fix it .
no , i won't .
like you fixed everything else .
no .
what?
you won't?
no , i won't .
i can't believe you'd just throw away your place in history .
i already have , we're cycling up .
think you can go behind my back?
huh?
kramer !
kramer?
make the prisoner ready .
what is your will , my lord?
back to work .
secure her to the battlements .
i want to be sure the french can see her .
at once , my lord .
i'll give your brother a choice .
oh , shit .
you are to be tied to the battlements .
what?
either he lays down his arms or he kills you with his own weapons .
let us hope a man who stoops to using his own sister as a spy still has some sense of decency left .
god be with you , lady .
it's her .
it's lady claire .
i delivered her to arnaut for safekeeping .
how did the english get her?
it's history .
then history will change .
oliver .
release lady claire and bring her down to me now , or by god , i will destroy your arsenal .
marek !
no !
get the hell out of here .
go now !
halt !
for god's sake .
if that thing blows , it'll kill us all .
bring her down .
no !
do not touch her !
my lord , if he drops the torch , he then kills her too .
he will not do it .
back off , de kere .
or decker , or whatever your name is .
i will blow your arsenal to hell !
there's no way out .
you're english .
no .
no , no , we're not .
you're english !
this is a trap !
run , my lord !
marek !
you are working for oliver .

open the gate .
chris , stop !
it's solid .
let me get up .
i've gotta get up .

yeah .
this is for france .
we gotta get out of here .
where's marek?
i don't know .
he went after lady claire .

my ear !
it's me .
it's me .
it's not working .
well , it's broken .
ok .
i gotta get marek .
de kere took his .

i'll get the other marker .

i'm gonna miss you , marek .
if you can do it , then do it .
one more minute .
eighty one percent , ok?
what's he doing?
