let me get this straight , it took a bite out of your arm , but you didn't see it at all?
well , it all happened so fast and it was dark ,
well , i saw it , it was a wolf , but bigger , it was like a monster wolf ,
yeah , jimmy , i have your statement already ,
fine , don't believe me , i know what i saw ,
what happened to her .. , what kind of an animal could do that?
a mountain lion , a bear , maybe .
there hasn't been a wolf sighting in southern california in over 70 years ,
mountain lion , my ass , jimmy ,
please ,
why don't you go check on zipper?
don't worry , whatever it was , we'll find it ,

hey , whoa ,
freak ,

what's there to talk about?
jimmy , we were attacked ,
we saw a girl get torn apart ,
you wanna talk about the bear or the mountain lion?
look , i know you're mad at me , but i didn't see what you saw ,
i'm sorry , but i don't know what else to say ,
ok , well , uh , thanks for the talk , good night ,
oh , come on , jimmy ,
i'm trying here ,
'unsolved .. , '
ok ,
jesus , '1600 animal attacks .. , '
'.. , large wolf like animals , '
oh , my god ,
jesus ,
oh , sorry , i didn't mean to scare you , what are you doing here?
i just .. , i needed to talk to you ,
i found the extra key under the mat , i'm really sorry ,
i just , i feel so terrible about how we left things tonight ,
jake , what's going on?
i'm just scared , ellie ,
i'm scared ,
i never expected to meet a woman like you ,
jake , you're the only good thing that's happened in my life in a long time ,
i'm scared too ,
i'm terrified , because all the good things keep going away ,
i'm not going anywhere ,
here in los angeles , a young woman was attacked and killed by an unidentified wild animal when her car ran off the road last night , high in the hollywood hills . the victim's name has yet to be released .
it happened on a remote stretch of mulholland drive , shortly before midnight .
animal control officers speculate that it might have been a bear that wandered into the area in search of water .
it is the first such fatal attack in los angeles ...
hey , how are you doing # did you sleep ok?
i woke up in the bushes ,
you woke up where?
are you feeling ok?
i'm calling dr , steinberg ,
no , no , i'm fine , really , actually .. , i feel kinda great ,
ok ,
but i'm gonna make an appointment , they said we should follow up with another shot ,
for all we know , that wolf could've had rabies ,
oh , oh , so now it's a wolf ,
jimmy , i never said it wasn't , i just said i didn't see it ,
it was more like a werewolf ,
and i found this website last night and according to legend , a werewolf feeds during the lunar cycle that's the three nights around the full moon ,
last night was the first moon of the lunar cycle ,
why can't you just download porn like other teenage boys?
excuse me for trying to make conversation ,
ok , so what would a werewolf be doing in la? shouldn't it be off in the countryside somewhere , terrorizing helpless maidens?
maybe it's a hip werewolf , maidens come here with the perfectly implanted breasts ,
you should get to school , hey , i was bitten by a werewolf ,
if that's not good enough for a sick day .. , i could be cursed ,
everybody's cursed , jimmy , it's called life ,
no , i mean by the mark of the beast ,
is that what the kids are calling it these days?
here you go , thanks ,
whoa , hey , ellie , hey , kyle ,
hey , '70s retro week is booking up , do we want keith partridge or marcia brady?
only one slot left , marcia , marcia , marcia ,
you look different today , saucy , i like it ,
yeah , it's new , gauze look , nice , what happened?
oh , you don't wanna know , hey , are you ok?
yeah , actually , i'm fine ,
incoming psycho publicist , one o'clock , .. , no trades , oh , i have to go , yeah , ok , goodbye ,
ellie # hi ,
i didn't recognize you with your hair down ,
i just wanted to drop by to make sure we were set for scott s pre interview tonight ,
absolutely , nine o'clock , great , is that what you're gonna wear?
hey , i heard that you're dating jake taylor , is that true?
i hope it's nothing serious , why not?
i guess it was only a matter of time before he got to you ,
he always did prefer the vulnerable ones , ok , well , i'll see you tonight , joannie ,
i'm only saying this because i care ,
is there anything else , joannie?
no , tonight , don't be late ,
ok , thank you , ok ,
putting on weight , kyle?
what a piece of work , i do not like that woman ,
no , apparently jake didn't either , i didn't even know that she knew him ,
do you think she's right about him?
no , the woman's cuckoo for cocoa puffs ,
but i'm not the one dating him , i just know he's not the only guy in town ,
what smells so good?
i .. , i don't smell anything ,
i get these ,
it's nothing , i'll live ,
the blood freaking you out?
hey , brooke , you need some change?
hey , jimmy ,
that'd be great , stupid thing won't take my dollar ,
oh , yeah , ok , actually .. ,

here you go , thanks ,
no , keep your money , it's on me , thanks ,
geek juice ,
trying out for the wrestling team , jimmy?
oh , no , i don't wrestle ,
oh , i'd think all that male to male contact would be right up your alley ,
is , uh .. , is that the appeal for you?
oh , back talk ,
haven't you been team captain for , like , two years now?
nicely done , jimmy ,
did you just attempt a confrontation?
yeah , maybe , let me know when you're sure ,
just ignore him , jimmy ,
let's get out of here before we get homo stained ,
hey , hey ,
# now the party's jumping , the place is packed
# but when the crowd's like this i'm ready to rap
# but before i could bust a thyme on the mic
# freaks are all over me like white on rice
# freaks come in all shapes and sizes and colors
# but what i like about them most is that they're real good lovers
# they do it in the park , they do it in the dark
# but most freaks are known for breaking hearts
joannie ,
joannie , there you are ,
what is this # come as your favorite endangered species?
obnoxious , isn't it?
i just feel a little underdressed without a tail ,
well , that's part of your charm , take this , i will tell scott that you're here ,
well , i think you look fantastic ,
what are you doing here?
i needed to see you ,
what about the opening?
disappearing for a few days ,
that didn't go over so well , did it?
you know what # it's fine ,
we've only been seeing each other a couple of months , you need your space ,
i get it , it's fine ,
please don't do that , don't try to make everything ok when it's not ,
can i talk to you in private for a second?
ellie , that was my mo for a long time , when anything would get too close or too serious ,
i would just run away ,
for .. ,
for a variety of reasons that i can't even begin to go into ,
i don't want to do that with us , this thing , you and me , this is special , ellie , and i just don't want to lose you , so i was hoping that , maybe , you could just bear with me for a little while longer ,
i guess i'm learning about these things as we go along ,
well , maybe i'll finish up here and we can go someplace to talk ,
ok , thank you , ellie ,
well , hi , there , remember me?
uh .. ,
jenny tate , becky morton's friend , right , of course , jenny ,
it's good to see you again , i was actually .. , jake ,
hi , hi , long time no see , sorry to interrupt an awkward moment , but we're ready for you ,
i have to go ,
ellie , i'm working , so , becky cannot stop talking about you , she's gonna die when she finds out you were here ,
excuse me , i have to go ,
i know it was only a couple of dates , but becky is really bummed you haven't called ,
next time you speak with her , tell her i'm sorry , but i've taken myself off the market ,
now i'm nummed ,
thanks for coming , i appreciate it , see you later ,
scott , this is ellie myers from the craig kilborn show ,
oh , hi , how are you?
hi , it's a pleasure to meet you ,
i've been a huge fan of yours ever since happy days .
thank you , listen , i appreciate you meeting me here , i couldn't bail on tonight ,
it's fine ,
you guys have a nice chat , i'll be over here if you need me ,
ok ,
have a seat , thank you ,
craig is so excited to have you on his show ,
i think it's gonna be just a fabulous line up ,
you'll be going on third , after ashton kutcher and carrot top ,
third?
uh .. ,
i thought that we would start with a chachi clip , and then move on to something from charles in charge .
original , and , uh .. , and then we could .. , segue into what you're doing now ,
what are you doing now?
you know , you're a beautiful girl ,
i mean , you've got this aura thing happening , l .. ,
i just can't quite put my finger on it ,
not when you can use your whole hand ,
thank you , i think that's really all we needed to discuss and i'll see you in the studio ,
ok , you got it , ok ,
wanna finish your drink?
no , bye ,
okey doke ,
excuse me ,
hey , where are you going?
call us !
ellie ,
ellie , wait up ,
jake , i really don't feel well tonight , i just wanna get home ,
be careful with this one , he's trouble ,
who's the leopard? someone i met before i met you ,
they keep popping up , don't they?
ellie , that was a previous life ,
please , you gotta trust me on this ,
you know what?
i think it's my turn to be weird ,
i'm gonna take a cue from you and disappear for a few days ,
ellie , people can change ,
i really don't wanna get into it right now ,
close , close , close , close !
oh , my god ,
hello # hello # anybody there?
hello # hello?
get me the fuck out of here !
open up !
hey , hi ,
are you doing homework?
i'm just reading up on how you kill a werewolf , silver , right?
no , you actually have to separate the head from the heart , silver just hurts a lot ,
it might not be such a bad deal , think about it , increased strength , heightened senses , an unnatural sexual allure ,
when do we sprout hair and pointy ears?
it's all a little sketchy , but maybe never , maybe tomorrow ,
the experts can't really agree on that one ,
you're starting to freak me out , jimmy , this is fiction , myth ,
we live in reality , come back to the other side ,
i know , i know , but the line between fiction and fact has always been a thin one ,
don't we have enough problems # do you really wanna add this one to the list?
ok , here , check this out , here ,
it's a five pointed star , it's a pentagram ,
it's the mark of the beast ,
jimmy , this is ridiculous , you need .. ,
whoa , jesus ,
wait , is this for real?
last night was difficult , ok?
the wreck , the girl dying , it brought up a lot of stuff ,
no , no , no , ellie , don't start with that , i know we don't talk about it enough ,
it has nothing to do with mom and dad , i miss them too ,
your hand , it's a creepy coincidence ,
this is some pretty freaky shit , admit it ,
ok , ok ,
let's put it to the test ,
i bought this frame myself , three years ago ,
it's from tiffany's , it's sterling silver ,
now , if i'm a werewolf , i shouldn't be able to pick it up , right?
it should hurt me , right?
according to chapter four , yeah ,
go to bed , jimmy , it's late ,
shut up !
shut up ,
don't forget , i'm working the opening of tinsel tonight ,
i've gotta take craig down the red carpet , ok ,
hello?
hey , jake's been calling all morning , says he needs to talk ,
well , i don't need to talk to him , what's with the gypsies?
oh , it's auditions for craig's sance segment , what is with this new look?
what are you talking about?
i'm not complaining , i think you look hot ,
you're in danger , excuse me?
it will come for you ,
don't let this getup fool you , i'm not a joke , i've got the gift , i blame my mother ,
why are you talking to me?
you bear the markings of the beast ,
look , i'm not trying to freak you out , but you've been infected , you're cursed ,
you've got to sever the line of the beast , it's the only way to break the curse ,
ok , all psychics back in their seats , please ,
the beast is human too , don't forget that ,
and it's closer to you than you think , if you could just follow me , shouldn't you psychically know when you're annoying someone?
thank you ,
whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , excuse me , miss , get up and get out ,
look at him ,
yeah !
oh , brooke , hey ,
are you stalking me?
maybe ,
what's going on , brooke?
you going fruit fly on me?
actually , we were just talking , but , if you don't mind .. , shoo ,
oh , you are asking for it , abercrombie ,
come on , bo , you're really becoming transparent ,
how about a little identity intervention , ok?
'cause all this internalized homophobia's giving you away ,
you better watch your ass , what's going on?
i'm just giving jimmy some pointers ,
he's here to try out for the team , really # you?
are you sure you want to do that , jimmy?
oh , sure he does , coach ,
i'll tell you what , i'll wrestle him ,
no , louie , you and jimmy take the mat ,
jimmy , suit up ,
he's so dead ,
ok , limp wrist , stay away from my groin ,
take him down , louie , take him down ,
have you had enough?
uh uh ,
let him up ,
watch his nails , lou !
he might scratch your eyes out !
you ok , lou?
all right ,
let me take a crack , coach , are you up for it , jimmy?
yeah ,
go for it , bo ,
come on , fairy , shake your dust , you'd like that , wouldn't you?
come on , fag , what?
do you like that # huh?
wait , no .. ,
you know the best part about being a fairy?
you get to fly ,
jimmy !
jimmy !
jimmy !
jimmy !
jimmy !
ashton kutcher's up first , god , he's so overexposed , stick to his film career as talk points , don't linger on the tv stuff ,
and if he doesn't mention the lnternet sex scandal , just don't bring it up ,
ok , you know what?
i've done this before ,
ok , i bump baio , what?
i'm living dangerously , carrot top's rehearsal was funny ,
i'm gonna let the top go long , randy's dealing with it ,
ok , my mouth's dry ,
thanks ,
you want me to do that?
i got it , ouch , dammit !
look ,
what happened?
do you have a tissue?
just stare at it ,
it's the late late show with craig kilborn .
ok , go , go !
you're on ,
mr , craig kilborn ,
excuse me , excuse me , ellie?
what the fuck do you mean , 'scott s been bumped? '
i just heard , we'll reschedule , reschedule , my ass ,
i'm sorry , the show was running long , then bump carrot top ,
it's scott baio , he shouldn't be going after carrot top anyway ,
he should be first , i'll make it up to you ,
listen to me , you little .. , don't start with me !
hi , ellie ,
are you ok in there?
i'm fine ,
you don't sound fine ,
what's the matter?
ellie?
no ! ,
ellie ,
ellie , your hand ,
ellie ,
what's wrong?
i'm just having a really bad day ,
just leave ,
can i help?
get the hell out of here !
get out !
hey , jake ,
jimmy , hey ,
cool place , are all clubs like this?
i sure hope not or i'm in nig trouble , so what's up , jimmy?
what are you doing here?
yeah , l .. , i kind of need someone to talk to , is that ok?
yeah , of course it is , step inside ,
ok , look , ellie won't admit it , but ever since the other night things have been different ,
we're different , what night # what are you talking about?
didn't ellie tell you?
no , tell me what?
we were in a wreck in the canyon , a girl was killed , she was ripped apart ,
by .. ,
i don't know , by some kind of animal ,
whatever it was bit me and now things have been happening to me ,
things i can't explain , jake , i know it sounds crazy , nut i think it was a .. , a werewolf ,
hm ,
what does your sister say about all this?
you know ellie ,
deny and avoid , it's her thing , but it got her too and now i think we're cursed ,
look , i almost took a guy's head off in gym ,
i'm not the kind of guy to take another guy's head off , i mean , look at me ,
what if it comes back?
i mean , i know enough to know that it's a who , not a what , so it could be pissed off ,
it may want to finish what it started ,
jimmy , i think you just need to calm down ,
i think the best thing we can do is just call your sister , get her down here and maybe the three of us should just sit down and discuss it ,
i don't want to discuss this , i've been cursed , something bad is gonna happen ,
i can .. , look , i can feel it ,
jimmy , listen to yourself ,
werewolves?
this was a mistake , sorry i bothered you , jimmy ,
no , no , thanks ,
jesus christ ,
bo , what are you doing here?
i just wanted to , kind of , talk ,
about that stuff you said today ,
what stuff?
about me , i was just wondering how you knew ,
no one else did , just you ,
and i've been so shitty to you , and then i thought , why wouldn't you know?
it takes one to know one , right?
of course , you would know , know what?
whoa , whoa , what are you doing?
i'm gay ,
i just can't keep it in anymore , i had to tell you , you're the only other gay guy i know ,
whoa , ok , stop , no , i'm not gay , not that there's anything wrong with it ,
this is hard for me , don't be like this , trust me , bo , i'm not gay , i'm cursed ,
i know , sure feels like that , doesn't it?
not being able to tell anyone ,
talk to anyone about it , no , i'm cursed by the mark of the beast ,
bo ,
i'm a werewolf ,
come on , jimmy , you don't have to pretend anymore , not with me ,
no , it's part of the curse , i'm appealing , i have an unnatural sexual allure ,
yeah , yeah , you do , i know ,
look , dude , i'm happy for you , you be gay , it's a good thing ,
unfortunately , i got my own shit to take care of , so best of luck , yay , go gay ,

ellie , kyle , what .. ,
what the hell's happening?
i heard people screaming , and then i lost craig , i lost craig ,
stay away from us , what # why? show me your hand ,
the other hand , ellie , we don't have time for this ,
there's an animal on the loose , it could be anywhere ,
what # you guys hear something?
where the fuck did he go?
i don't know ,
jimmy?
come on ,
come on , come on , keep going , but it's closed ,
shit , we can't get out , we're fucked , where are we going?
i don't know , shit , where does this go # come on , shit , there should be doors , look for a door ,
there's nothing , look over there , ok ,
no , they're not here ,
weren't there three?
what?
there's three microphones , there's only two .. ,
jimmy !
showtime , lsn't that what they say?
joannie ,
just for the record , i didn't ask for this ,
it was just a hot night with the guy that every girl in town wanted ,
lucky me , i should've been more careful though ,
i got a little rough in bed and wound up cursed by the mark of the fucking beast ,
that jake , he's a catch , oh , my god ,
i thought he was the one , you know , but all i got was a couple of dates , some hot sex , and a 'i'm not ready for a relationship right now , it's not you , it's me , '
men , they're all beasts ,
jake didn't want me , and if i can't have him .. ,
well , you know how that line goes , hey , l .. ,
the funny thing is , i never saw you as a threat ,
i find you rather depressing myself ,
why do men always go for the tortured ones # poor damaged ellie ,
fuck you , bitch !
who's lost it now?
ok , just the two of us , fair fight , ok?
just me and you , all right # come on ,
ok , i'm right here ,
ok , let's go ,
fair fight?
this is hollywood ,
and you .. ,
you get one taste of blood and you freak out ,
jimmy , jimmy ,
come on , run ,
jake # you bounce back quickly ,
hi ,
it's you?
yeah ,
how did this happen , joannie?
well ,
i guess there's no such thing as safe sex with a werewolf ,
joannie , it doesn't have to be like this for you , there are ways for you to control it ,
like what # nibbling on coyotes in the desert # no thanks ,
i'm having too much fun eliminating the competition ,
pretty soon i'll have you all to myself ,
i won't let you kill her , joannie ,
jake !
honey , muffin ,
i am not gonna kill her , i promise ,
i'm just gonna rip her to shreds and let her choke on her own blood ,
then .. , maybe i'll eat her ,
you have to kill me first ,
you'd like that , wouldn't you?
well , i've learned a few things about this curse along the way , and i know better ,
but that doesn't mean i can't make it hurt a little ,
i don't see her , sh ,
ellie?
let's see how she deals with these ,
i'm gonna get you ,
where are you , you bitch?
get this off !
where's your brother?
where'd she go?
i don't know ,
well , maybe she left ,
or maybe not ,
did she see us?
i don't think .. ,
run !
jimmy , get out of here ,
jimmy !
ellie ,
ellie , wake up ,
wake up ,
you're playing with us , aren't you , joannie?
ellie ,
well , play this !
let's go !
let's go !
move along , let's go , yes , sir , shit !
move it ,
freeze ! , don't shoot ,
where's the animal?
it's up there somewhere ,
what's it supposed to be?
i don't know , stay alert , guys ,
what the hell is it , anyway?
oh , it's a werewolf , what?
did you say werewolf?
yeah , she may have changed back to her human form ,
her name is joannie , she's this hyper , skinny publicist ,
any other description?
yeah , she's , what # like , five foot seven? she's got a bony ass , and fat thighs , and bad skin , liar !
shoot !
hold your fire !
hold your fire !
man , that's ugly , careful ,
it's dead , all clear ,
that's fucked up , yeah , ok ,
stand down , what is this thing?
i told you , it's a werewolf , you have to separate the head from the ..
repeat , all clear ,
call animal control ,
get them out of here ,  is she dead?
yeah , her brain's on the floor , that should do it ,
jake , bo ,
hey , i need a paramedic in here ,
bo , bo , bo ,
yeah , are you ok?
hey , jimbo , how'd i do?
you did good ,
i'm gonna go look for jake , ok?
yeah ,
hey , you good?
yeah , he sucker punched me , i was about to kick his ass ,
ok ,
did you find him?
no ,
i'm telling you , we shot the shit out of this , really?
you're gonna need a forklift , this thing is .. , huge ,
i think we can handle it ,
it looked a little bigger before ,
oh , shit !
are you ok?
are you all right?
i think so , yeah ,
so , it's over , right?
and joannie's dead , so we're ok now ..
well , that's subjective , we still have to go back to our pathetic precurse lives ,
i'm personally ok with that , well , you're not in high school ,
what happened?
zipper ,
are you ok?
i will be ,
what's wrong?
are you worried about jake?
his secret's out , he had to disappear , i don't want to talk about it , ok?
i know you think he's a good guy , ellie , but don't forget , all of this , everything we've been through , is because of him ,
when it comes down to it , a monster is still a monster ,
jimmy , that's enough ,
i guess some things never change ,
do you think you can get us some light?
yeah , yeah , i'll check the circuit breaker ,
zipper?
how are you doing with those lights?
yeah , one second , shit ,
is everything ok down there?
yeah , it's fine , i just .. ,
thank you ,
zipper?
it's ok , it's just me , sorry , i'm still working on the fuses , it's a little dark in here , i'll be up in a minute ,
jake ,
how are you , ellie?
jake , something's wrong , i'm .. ,
sh ,
it'll be ok , just breathe , you'll be ok ,
what's happening to me?
it's starting , ellie ,
it's almost midnight , oh , no ,
no ,
this can't happen , jake , ellie ,
ellie , sh , it's ok , you're gonna be ok ,
i came back for you , i have to stop it ,
you have to help me stop it , ellie , it's not really that simple ,
but you have nothing to worry about , this is how we can be together ,
you need this , ellie ,
you need me ,
you said it could be controlled , you don't have to worry ,
i can teach you how to live with this , and we have years to figure it out , so that's your answer?
we live happily ever after?
there's no reason why we can't now ,
think about it , your parents are dead , your brother is miserable , your life is a mess ,
why do you think it is that you fell for me so hard and so fast?
i gave you a reason to live again , ellie , and i can still do that for you ,
jake , i don't want this , it's the only way we can be together , ellie ,
but i don't want you , tell me how to get rid of it , tell me how !
the only way you can break the curse is for the one who started it all to die ,
and that s me .
i'm not ready to die just yet , i can't let my brother live like this ,
you know i have to think of him first ,
i know , i bet you promised your parents that you'd give him a good life , didn't you?
but you know what , ellie # you're really not doing a very good job , are you?
in fact , you're kind of a disaster , get away from me ,
i don't want you to worry about your brother , ok?
after all , there's only room for one alpha male ,
and i really think we should put the poor kid out of his misery , don't you?
where is that brother of yours , anyway?
now , where could he be?
in the basement?
these heightened senses are a kick , huh?
no hard feelings , buddy ,
i'll make it as quick as possible ,
take it easy with the silver , ellie , you're a monster ,
join the club ,
that's only the beginning , ellie ,
i should've known you couldn't handle this ,
you're too weak to think you could survive it , it only makes you stronger ,
but you're too stupid , too timid ,
it comes and goes at first ,
i probably should've told you that ,
unfortunately now you both have to die , hey !
you'd better run , you little shit ,
i am going to kill you ,
like you said , what doesn't kill you .. ,
it's over ,
are you sure # you were a little off on that whole 'how to break the curse 'thing ,
yeah , well , the books kind of glossed over that part ,
uh huh ,
we're going to be ok ,
zipper ,
brooke ,
what are you doing here?
hey , jimmy ,
i found your dog , he was wandering the streets ,
how'd you know where i lived?
i told her ,
are you ok?
yeah , you?
i'm good , thanks ,
uh .. ,
can i walk you home? sure ,
are you coming?
yeah , see you later ,
nice moves , it's the new me ,
i'm just gonna stay here , and , uh .. , clean ,
come on , zipper ,
