three months .
i was assigned overseas and ...
oh , yeah .
you were gonna call me .
i didn't know you'd been assigned ...
to ireland?
yes .
well , you missed a few beats , eddie .
i am now the official liaison ... ... between the local interpol office and southeast asian security forces .
maybe if you stayed in touch like you promised ...
nicole .
i should have called .
i'm sorry .
that's worth something .
not a lot , but something .
commander?
inspector yang is here to see you .
yes .
i'm hammerstock smythe .
delighted to meet you , inspector .
likewise , commander .
commander , i was just ...
what the bloody hell is he doing here?
hello , watson .
you're not telling me he'll be working on this case?
watson , we need all the help we can get .
yes .
you remember this boy?
yes , i saw him in the temple .
so?
who's he?
one moment .
yes , i recognize him .
this is lester wong .
snakehead's number two man .
that's privileged information , eyes only , need to know and all that .
i need to find him , watson .
yes , well , i'm sorry , my friend ... ... but that's classified .
we've received a tip off ... ... that snakehead does have a new shipment arriving tomorrow in ireland .
maybe the boy will come with it .
where?
we don't know .
go back east , eddie .
stick to what you know .
watson !
what? !
i mean ...
sorry .
what?
any more nonsense like this ... ... and you will be off the case , and the inspector here will be in charge of it .
satisfied?
you've only been here five minutes .
watson !
you are in my filing cabinet .
yes .
i was just getting these .
i think we're in trouble .
yes , i think everything is in order .
what do you think?
is it?
well , yes .
well , let me have it checked out .
yes , sir .
watson , wait .
let's put hong kong behind us .
i'm sorry , is somebody talking to me?
we were partners .
we were good together .
you need me .
really?
what do you want me to do?
just welcome you back with open arms?
we had a good thing going , and you left !
watson .
it just wasn't for me anymore .
i thought you understood .
oh , i understand .
i understand that you didn't like me always being on top .
okay , you can be on top .
whatever you want .
let's just do it together .
okay?
no , but you have fun doing it by yourself .
all right?
you think because of the way ...
thank you .
think we ...
well , we're not .
i'm a man !
yes .
no , there's nothing wrong when two people love ... ... one another .
it's a good thing .
i ...
that's your fault , that is .
now , i'm gonna go home and cook dinner for my wife !
so on a scale of one to 10 ... ... how did that go?
about a seven .
below zero .
i think i know just what you need .
dinner .
dinner?
yes , dinner .
we need watson for this investigation , eddie .
he's stubborn , but if we can catch him off guard ... ... maybe loosen him up , i think we can work it out .
i'll just be myself .
one more thing .
watson's family ... ... they don't know that he's an interpol agent .
what do they think he is?
a librarian .
a librarian?
yes .
hi .
nice apron .
thanks .
look , you can't just turn up and barge in .
darling , i was wondering if you saw my spatula .
charlotte , hello .
hello .
please .
please come in .
please .
thank you .
arthur , you didn't tell me we were having guests .
please , welcome .
didn't know myself .
we're librarians .
librarian?
charlotte , this is eddie yang from hong kong .
are you staying for dinner?
yes .
no .
absolutely not .
thank you .
see what you've done to my chops?
what's that called?
now?
lamb a la victim .
right .
well , yes .
come on .
you know the score .
you eat , you work .
what brings you to dublin?
right .
i was looking for ...
looking for a rare book .
yes , actually , we were wondering ... ... if arthur would help us find this rare book .
oh , well , unfortunately , i'm looking for that book myself , so ...
maybe we could find it together .
but i'm head librarian , though , right?
right .
you need help checking in?
i already checked in .
okay .
here .
directions .
where to meet watson tomorrow .
he told me to give them to you .
why can't he just pick me up?
it's watson .
privileged information , eyes only , need to know and all that . " so ...
okay .
okay .
nicole .
yeah?
tonight was fun .
yeah .
excuse me .
is this place far away or close by?
far away .
hop in the car and i'll take you .
thank you .
what are you doing?
move .
move !
move !
get out of the way !
oh , my !
sorry .
did you see that?
what are you doing?
open this door !
hey , what's going on?
now , mind yourself .
come on .
wait a minute .
what are you doing?
i haven't even done any ...
say it !
talk !
where's the boy?
let me out of here or i'll kick your ass .
speak english !
you are hard to understand !
you ever hear of police brutality?
sounds like fun .
one more chance until you kick the can .
you mean , " kick the bucket .
what?
you mean , " kick the bucket .
if you say so .
what kind of music you like?
okay , okay , okay .
just let me out and we can talk about this , all right?
he's coming on a boat .
i don't know what time .
a freighter .
he'll be coming into the docks .
a boat !
look , just let me out of here !
do you know how long i've been waiting here for you?
what's the matter?
you sound like an obscene phone call .
you're out of shape .
you should keep fit .
right , but let's not waste any more time , shall we?
pier 5 .
well , that must be the ship , if giscard's telling the truth .
let's hope so .
it's all we've got to go on .
now , these are very dangerous people , all right?
do you have a gun?
no , are you going to give me one?
no , get your own bloody gun .
and remember , i'm head librarian , all right?
all right?
yes .
right .
here's the plan .
i'll circle around to the left .
you circle ar ...
you circle arou ...
and i'll just bloody talk to myself .
then you go straight through .
go around .
welcome , chosen one .
excuse me .
you're under arrest .
come on !
he went this way !
have you seen him?
there .
watson , come on !
where's the boy?
we couldn't find him .
find him !
shoot him .
you okay?
go , go , go , go !
get the boy !
interpol !
freeze !
hello?
hello , it's me .
me , who?
eddie !
where are you?
i'm trapped inside the container with the boy .
stay right where you are .
i'm on my way .
what color is it?
i don't know .
watson .
eddie's in a container .
which one?
i have absolutely no idea .
there !
there !
it's eddie .
eddie .
eddie , it's nicole .
just hang on .
watson , get over here .
i need your help !
nicole !
oh , my god !
don't be afraid .
i'm not afraid .
we'll be all right .
we got control of the container .
we believe that there's bodies inside .
i need an oxygen tank and a stretcher .
now !
eddie , please don't leave me , eddie .
eddie , come back to me .
eddie , please .
you all right?
please .
eddie , come back .
nicole ... ... he's gone .
come on .
god bless , eddie .
god bless .
nicole .
we've got work to do .
you sure?
i'm sure .
let's go .
i'm sorry ... ... i wasn't there when you needed me most , my friend .
that was nice .
thank you .
i ...
what's wrong?
who are you?
what's the matter?
who are you?
what ...?
what are we doing here?
where's my clothes?
watson .
watson .
watson !
get away from me !
it must be fake .
well , it certainly looks like you .
my nose isn't that big .
it's really me .
are you sure?
don't you think i recognize my own thing?
it's cold in here .
let me take a look .
what's happening to me?
all right .
let's just ... ... stay calm .
i'm sure there's a perfectly rational explanation for this .
think back .
you were on the boat , in the container .
what happened?
lights everywhere .
the boy .
the boy?
medallion .
yes .
i have it .
it was in your pocket .
what's this?
wow .
where did you go?
excuse me , nurse .
we're from interpol .
would you mind if we have a few moments with the boy?
you know , the man outside says you're not eating .
you should eat to gain strength .
how are you feeling?
feeling .
feel .
feeling .
bit bumpy out there on the ocean waves?
bit rough?
out there?
out there on the high seas?
bumpity bumpity?
excuse me .
we have to take him for a checkup now .
yes , yes , yes .
wait .
i think this belongs to you .
half for me?
nice lad .
you okay?
that nurse ...
yeah .
her boots ...
no .
her boots .
oh , boots .
nurses don't wear boots .
watch out !
get out of my way !
sorry .
get the boy .
stop him .
what the heck?
give me that !
there he goes !
come here .
i got him .
i got him .
there he is .
he's mine .
i've got him .
let's go .
jai !
clear all exits .
right , sir .
watson , are you there?
i'm not here .
what happened?
snakehead's men .
they were here for the boy .
i'm gonna keep him with me .
good idea .
keep him safe .
yes .
yes .
watson , you did all this alone?
no , eddie is ...
i mean , i think i mentioned that eddie wasn't the only one with a black belt .
so you're all right?
perfect .
great .
okay .
i'll see you back at the ...
yeah .
i'm gonna do a couple of press ups and meet you back there .
yes .
yes .
you just take care of the boy .
eddie , listen ...
watson , something wrong .
snakehead's men got away again , but at least the boy is safe .
i mean , something wrong with me .
hit me .
what?
go on , hit me .
no , i can't do that .
it's okay , i don't mind .
well , i mind .
i mean ...
a chap could break a finger , you know .
okay .
use this .
no , thanks .
i went before i came out .
no , hit me with this .
for real?
yes .
god .
there you go .
all right?
harder .
i can't do this .
this is ridiculous .
the queen hits harder than that .
how ...
how dare you .
oh , my god .
are you all right?
oh , god .
i'm so sorry , my friend .
did it hurt?
of course it hurt .
but nothing .
i was shot before ... ... but i was okay .
shoot me .
go ahead .
no , i think the embalming fluid has gone to your head .
this is ridiculous .
give me the gun .
absolutely not .
i'll show you .
you know how many forms i have to fill out if i fire my gun?
absolutely not .
this is how accidents happen .
look .
amazing .
no blood .
amazing .
incredible .
see?
i mean , still ...
that's incredible .
i mean , just ...
stop that .
i'm sorry .
that was below the belt .
i'm sorry .
that's what i mean .
can one of you explain this latest failure?
why you couldn't retrieve one small boy?
sir ... ... this might sound crazy ... ... but i emptied a whole clip into that chinese cop and he still wouldn't die .
what chinese cop?
that's eddie yang .
he's supposed to have died yesterday , drowned in that container .
then it's true .
professor .
doctor .
doctor .
professor .
doctor .
doctor .
thank you for being here .
we've come across something very interesting .
have you ever seen this before?
doesn't ring a bell .
doctor?
i've seen that before .
the fish is the sign of life .
that's interesting .
and the snake is the sign of ...
whoa .
the medallion .
you're gonna love this .
now , it should have a serpent on one side .
and a fish on the other .
if what you have is real , that is the holy grail of eastern mythology .
and maybe the secret to eternal life .
sweet !
where'd you get the medallion?
i recognize the fish .
you got it from a kid , didn't you?
yes .
the legend says every thousand years ... ... a child is chosen that can bind the halves together ... ... and restore life to the dead .
you get that kid and the medallion ... ... you're a god .
that's nonsense .
so where's the other half?
wait !
the ancient texts say that if you want superhuman strength ... ... and immortality , you need both halves .
the only documented case of a genuine resurrection ...
you can't weigh it , measure it , smoke it .
look , ancient texts aren't fairy tales .
thank you , professor .
doctor .
doctor .
cheerio , for now .
good luck .
why would a young boy have something like this?
this snakehead chap , is he after the medallion or the boy?
by the way , take good care of that kid .
the medallion can not only give life , it can take it away .
okay , i'll cover the front door , call in for backup .
you go to the rear to nicole's apartment as fast as you can .
got it .
sorry .
you know , for a little person , you sure do eat a lot .
still going?
what did you have?
okay .
here we go .
try that .
that good?
you don't like ...
you're not ...
one of my culinary skills ... ... other than peeling fruit , of course ... ... just so happens to be a toasted ... ... peanut butter and jelly sandwich ... ... which , i might add , eddie could eat for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
then again , he didn't really have any choice .
why?
because i can't cook anything else .
i just can't believe that he's really gone .
he's not gone .
jai ... ... do you not understand that eddie's not coming back?
i pulled him back .
okay ...
jai , eddie's ...
he ...
just hold on .
see?
oh , my god .
eddie?
eddie .
jai !
no !
eddie !
you see?
i told you he wasn't dead .
the boy , sir .
yes .
welcome ... ... my old friend .
so ... ... a quick , painless death ... ... followed by resurrection ... ... immortality ... ... and powers beyond your dreams .
are you sure?
his order is ruled by reverence for life .
my death before him must be reversed .
and if it isn't ... ... kill him .
and then who would bring you back , chosen one?
pitiful mortal .
so ... ... i have no further use for you , chosen one .
you're not immortal .
what?
to become immortal , you need both halves of the medallion .
where's the other half?
tell me !
nicole .
eddie .
it's me .
i'm fine , really .
i just ...
i still don't understand , eddie , because i was there ... ... and i saw you , and ...
nicole , it's me .
you see , it's just that i was at the container and you were dead .
i mean , you were dead .
nicole , the boy uses the medallion to give life .
that's why snakehead took him .
with the boy and the medallion , he could ...
he could become like you?
yes , but he needs the whole medallion ... ... and he only has half .
look ... ... this is a touching reunion .
we're all glad that eddie's amongst the living ... ... but we still haven't found snakehead's helicopter .
get online .
find anything that was in the air in the last hour .
i don't care if it was a bird , a plane or bloody superman .
no offense , old chap .
eddie .
if he needs the other half , he's gonna come looking for you .
if he is looking for me ... ... he'll be looking for my partner .
me?
my family .
my family .
cool .
see , that's not normal .
i mean , that's not natural .
what ...?
eddie , take my bike !
thank god .
they're all right .
charlotte?
charlotte?
i have something i have to tell you .
yes , dear?
eddie ...
watson !
they're here !
go !
go !
charlotte , where are you going?
this is no time for cleaning .
take your shield !
watson !
are you all right , love?
yes , i'm fine , dear .
catch !
here .
i'll lead them away .
your wife?
what the ...?
there you are .
quick .
quick .
that's a good boy .
now , listen .
guns are very dangerous things , all right?
right .
how dare you shoot ... ... at my ... ... wife !
my lord .
where'd he go?
we meet again ... ... eddie yang .
where's the boy?
my guest is no concern of yours .
all that matters is that you have the other half of the medallion .
don't run , eddie !
you can't hide from me !
the medallion is mine !
you think it's a game?
well , let's play !
we're the same , you and i.
what a pity .
what a waste .
you don't know what powers you have .
destiny calls .
he's sleeping .
at least , i think that's what he's doing .
he doesn't even look like he's breathing .
the boy !
oh , god , i wish you wouldn't do that .
eddie , you're all right .
the boy's in danger .
he's going to kill him .
right? !
snakehead has taken the boy to raven's keep .
i told you everything i know .
i did .
we need to move fast .
of course i can fly this thing .
i built it myself .
you take the bike .
i'll guide you from the air .
i'm driving .
that's raven's keep .
it's five miles away .
you should wash your hands .
come on .
nicole .
be careful .
you too .
what the hell are you doing here?
where's the boy?
let's get out of here !
move !
you cowards !
watson .
watson !
are you crazy?
be careful .
interpol .
freeze .
jai , are you all right?
there she is !
get her !
excuse me .
you looking for something?
interpol !
freeze !
interpol !
freeze !
interpol !
free ...
jai , thank god .
you're in danger .
it's over .
you're safe now .
i don't think so .
no , it's all right .
run !
for your lives .
it's not nice to take things that don't belong to you .
fetch .
my brother ... ... don't be sentimental .
it's so unnecessary .
it's so human .
so normal .
you and i will live forever .
we are the lords of time .
we can take whatever we choose .
i mean , what difference can a single human life like hers make to us?
we are immortal .
let me show you .
eddie , use the medallion to end the life that it gave .
can you?
it's your turn .
what's that for?
that , eddie yang , is for not catching me .
and that , eddie yang , is for not catching me .
interpol !
freeze !
isn't that lovely?
of course ... ... when he came back , he was naked .
i mean , completely starkers .
not a stitch .
i'm not complaining , mind you .
listen , i have this cough .
i think it's quite serious .
honestly , i could snuff at any point .
i don't suppose you'd consider a rub on your medallion?
i really am .
hello?
it's very bad ...
very bad .
you ...
please , the med ...
one quick rub .
that's all .
oh , the medallion .
quick .
give me the medallion .
give it .
all right .
it was only a tickle anyway .
come with me .
wait !
nicole !
eddie !
you can't leave me here .
goodbye !
okay , that wasn't scary at all .
he walked through a vortex to the next universe .
i'm going this way .
quiet on the set .
are cameras ready?
cameras are ready .
jackie , claire .
and action .
i'm sorry .
can you overlap that line for me?
eddie yang .
i knew there couldn't be two of you .
will you say action , or am i just ...?
i did .
okay , here we go .
and action .
three months and not so much as a phone call?
that made me so nervous .
i slapped you so hard .
come on !

in the middle ... !
i got slapped for nothing !
i'm so sorry .
i am so sorry .
i'm so sorry .
i can't believe it .
