you are so beautiful .
you look like a rose blooming in a secret flower garden .
you , bastard !
this is private garden .
i really want you to look at this .
oh , this is from hollywood .
about the production of the scenario and casting you sent , we are in the middle of preliminary trials
the title is a bouquet of the adriatic sea .
that's nice .
really?
that means o. k. , doesn't it?
gina , come to hollywood with me .
i was air pirates 'guardsman to obtain a fame and fortune .
next i want to be a hollywood star .
and , then?
the president !
i'm serious .
i promise to make you the first lady .
gina .
i like your for such stupidity .
really?
but i say no , because i already have a gamble going .
when i'm in this garden , if he comes over here , i will love him .
but he comes only to the restaurant at night .
and never emerges in the daylight .
that guy is coming back .
fool ...
he left without getting off the plane .
i lost the gamble again .
you're kidding !
the gamble is about that guy?
is that a problem?
life is more complicated here than in your country .
here i can fall in love anytime i want .
kid , go to hollywood by yourself , ok?
kid ...
i hit my head because you did an acrobatic maneuver all of a sudden .
i just said hello to my friend .
to gina of the hotel adriano?
she wore a white dress and was at the terrace of the hotel , wasn't she?
my grandpa told me that all pilots of the adriatic sea fall in love with gina
you speculate a lot .
so , how is the lady?
you fell in love with her too , didn't you?
we are going down refuel .
close your mouth , or you'll bite your tongue .
wa !
wait !
uwaa ...
a girl on a fighter?
where's porco?
he is talking with my dad .
not only the temporary government but guys in the king's faction have tried to get along with the air pirates .
here you are .
thanks .
no thanks for such a bad news ...
you'd better present yourself to either side .
they will pay a fortune for your skill .
you got a cigarette?
curtis is will go back to america sooner or later .
it's us who should to go to america .
goodbye to freedom in the adriatic sea .
is it byron's?
no , it's mine .
see you later .
porco , this is bad news .
the gas price is three times as much as in ltaly .
don't be like a businessman , make it cheaper .
this gas is genuine .
that's why i hate women .
hey , mr. would you tell her ...
pay him , fio .
after that , put your big butt and your looks in the space between the machine guns .
we're going to fly to my home .
i'll add the gas bill to the other bills .
nobody can live alone .
we rely on each other .
nobody lives around here , even though the landscape is beautiful .
here we are .
that island is my home .
it's a wonderful place .
an excellent co ordinator .
ohh ... my butt is stiff from the long flight .
the pig ...
don't move !
they stinks , again ...
boss , we caught him !
boss !
shit !
don't step on me ...
back off !
i was waiting for you , pig !
i knew you'd coming here .
you gave us a lot of trouble .
it's a girl .
the pig is with a girl .
she is pretty ...
shut up !
what's about a girl?
about a half of the worlds population are women !
hey , that girl is not an ordinary one .
she is a chief engineer at the piccolo company .
but , she is very young and pretty .
that girl?
she made my plane much better then before .
she may be young , but she's really something .
is that true?
you are good with airplanes in general .
be polite , boys .
she came with me to collect my debts .
you are deeply in debt after all .
it serves you right !
damage?
are you going to break the plane i made?
are you going to break such beautiful airplane with axes?
miss , there is a complicated reason behind this ...
you are going to break , aren't you?
but , what i want to say is ...
are you guys really fighter pilots?
would you back off?
my shoes .
i have grown up with a lot of stories about the pilots since i was a small child .
my grandpa always told me that no one is as nice as the pilots .
it's because sea and sky purify their hearts .
hence , the pilots are much braver then the sailors , and more proud then the ordinary pilots
don't tell me .
i know that .
what they want the most , he said , is neither money nor women , but honor .
yes , you're right !
a toast to the pilots !
she's really something .
i understand .
i'll give up on breaking the plane , you made , with axes .
but we'll be mortified if we don't do anything .
let's lynch the pig !
lynch the pig !
what the hell you talking about !
you guys don't understand anything .
i asked whether you feel ashamed or not .
aren't you ashamed of being helped by curtis , the american?
if your mother heard of that , she would cry , and don't even take a shower .
porco came back to fight against curtis , for pride and honor of the pilots of the adriatic .
you guys are lowest of the low !
i told you not to hire curtis , eh !
just like a girl .
don't try to excuse yourself .
boss , what are we supposed to do?
she convinced us .
how about asking curtis to fight the pig?
do we ask him to fight the plg , again?
the contract is already over .
i'm ashamed of it ...
that's curtis !
i got it .
i'm not going to run away !
you made your passage through there?
hey , hold this .
you want a return match , don't you .
but i won once , already .
besides , i am not a bounty hunter for these guys .
what's your proposition?
beautiful !
will you marry me if i win?
i'm serious .
o. k.
instead , if porco wins , you pay these bills .
wait , fio !
you back off !
miss , you still have time to think about that .
ask him , not me .
this is very expensive .
it's very cheap .
are you going to fight or not?
i'm willing to fight for love .
o. k.
listen up everybody .
i'm really impressed with miss fio's decision .
we , 'mamma aiuto ', are going to back up this fight up !
yes ...
let the air pirates union do this , too !
yes ...
miss fio !
see you soon !
this sucks !
hey pig , don't run away !
shut up , get lost !
bye bye !
this is ridiculous .
well , you are .....
don't tell me .
i know , i am foolish .
fio ,
i think i have to say thank you .
you gave me a chance to fight curtis .
thanks .
we share the same luck .
we are partners , aren't we?
we are going to have a hard time .
i trust you .
trust me , eh?
i haven't heard that in a long time , but i'm glad you said that .
what's wrong?
you feel sick?
fio?
i'm fine .
it's just that my heart is pounding .
to be honest , i was really scared .
hey?
i want to swim .
porco !
i made a mistake !
are you o. k?
i should have padded the deal .
we have a bad bargain .
ha, ha, ha, ha .
you're right .
ha, ha, ha, ha .
porco ....
hmm?
you can't sleep , can you?
now , i just saw ...
it may have been a dream ...
every thing is all right .
it's too early in the morning to get up .
porco .
why did you become a pig?
i don't know .
i know a lot about captain marco pabatto .
my father used to be in the same unit .
i've heard many a story , in which the captain saved lives of enemy pilots , i liked it .
porco !
how about if i kiss you?
you know a fairy tale where a princess takes off a curse on a prince , who was changed to a frog .
you , silly .
save it for your man !
won't my kiss work?
huh , you are a nice girl .
you make me feel comfortable and make me wish to be a human being again .
be a nice girl and go to sleep .
tell me your story and i will .
my story?
well ...
it was the last summer of the war .
we were fly over the adriatic sea on our usual patrol .
belneldi was flying on my right side .
he was an old friend of mine .
he got married just two days before .
i was the matchmaker .
he didn't have enough leave to be with his wife for long .
so , he returned to duty .
everyone was falling down like flies , whether a friend or a foe .
i was chased by three planes , and had no time to worry about my friend .
at the end i was the only one remaining of my unit .
but , they never gave up chasing me .
i made desperate efforts to run away .
my hands and feet went numb , and i grew dizzy .
i thought i was going to die .
it was at that time that
i saw the white sky .
white?
yeah , it was like a flash .
because of the brightness , it took me a while to realize that i was in a cloud .
i was worn out , and didn't have any power left to control my plane .
in spite of that my plane continued to fly .
a cloud of planes ...
yeah , it was calm , and the sky was very clear , too clear .
there was a line of clouds far above me .
belneldi , you are alive , aren't you !
belneldi , wait , where are you going !
belneldi , don't go !
are you going to leave gina alone? !
i'll go instead of you !
when i recovered my senses , i was flying over the sea , almost touching it , alone .
god said it wasn't your time yet , didn't he?
in my mind i thought he might let me fly like that forever .
that would not have been right , because your are a good guy !
good guys are all dead already .
besides , there might have been hell inside that cloud .
well , my story is over .
go to sleep .
shit , they gave me crap ...
i'm glad you came back to live because i like you .
good night !
hey , hey , which one's gonna win , a pig or ... 08 : 07
you need ice cream , telescope?
fools .
they make our fight into a festival .
are they all air pirates?
trash of the mediterranean sea ...
gangs , pirates , smugglers , spies and even some ordinary people .
heh , this makes my fame rise more and more ...
ten minutes till start , ten minutes till start !
this is the fight between porco rosso and donald curtis !
there are no special rules , but an unfair fight will a disgrace to their fans .
shut up and start right now .
back off !
you shut up , or i kill you !
he'd be better off throwing a 10ton bomb ...
this is the fight which will determine the future of miss fio piccolo .
shut up !
do you understand?
if you do , clap your hands .
clap !
shut up , that's the routine .
well , both of you present your bids .
have a seat .
thank you .
put it on the chair properly !
none of you have anything to say , do you .
well shake hands or something before you start !
no way .
i'm fond of cleanliness .
he's hard to please .
fio , as soon as this fight is over , we will go to the church .
don't worry .
my mom told me your going to like me soon .
you ...
may i take a picture with you?
i took a shower already .
everybody , smile !
smlle !
if the flight is over in 3 minutes , the black plane has the advantage ...
this is great .
i want them to do this event every month
15 seconds to go .
they are so cool ...
5 seconds to go .
4 , 3 , 2 , 1 , 0 !
curtis took over !
this is going to be a one sided fight .
give me that .
porco , what are you doing !
fly over !
he would be shot if the took off now .
it's very difficult for curtis to shoot porco in this situation .
i know you want me to waste the bullet's .
i know it .
looping !
the pig took curtis 'back !
looping?
his skill made the pig an ace of the adriatic sea .
shit !
he's gonna shoot !
he doesn't open fire .
is his machine gun broken !?
i got it , i got it !
the pig won't shoot until the end .
the pig doesn't kill anybody .
now , the american should be fine .
you got it !
go and shoot !
oh , he didn't shoot yet ....
see , i told you ...
if the pig opened fire , it would kill the american , so , it's going to hit
curtis 'engine a few bullets after curtis gets tired .
he said this is not war , but ...
porco ...
are you teasing me or what?
come on !
is your gun broken , huh !
you , poor bastard !
they are coming this way !
come on , pig !
go away from here and fight over there !
great !
the pig is leaving a cloud trail .
come on !
shoot that side !
it's cool !
it's the first time i saw the plance leaving a cloud trail !
i've never seen such an air fight before .
i'm really impressed .
i ready for the flight .
she'd better hurry , or the fight will be over .
she's in her room , and doesn't come out .
does she want to go or not?
i want to see that fight ...
to g of heart , for the pig .
the air force found out about the fight .
stop the silly fight .
oh , this is must be from fierrali .
i should hurry .
first of all , both of them are very tough .
the show isn't over !
porco , fight !
i'm not going to give fio to a man
iike you .
o. k. the pig took curtis 'tail .
it's over !
this is the finish .
whoops ...
jammed , too .
you , idiot !
you are out of ammo !
whoops .
this is broken because of fio's butt ...
i'm not going to finish this fight with a draw .
ha , ha , ha , ha .
this is not a western .
you can't hit me .
you ...
you really think it will reach here?
you , stinking pig !
can't throw it !
bastard !
throw it finally !
for love !
shut up !
you piggy !
looks like something is wrong .
ah ... they are coming .
they are coming back !
wait !
bids don't leave from here .
o. k. wait , you guys .
you , fat pig !
you , chicken cowboy !
come on with your bare hands !
go back to cows !
porco , hold on !
stand up , pig .
go , go !
bets still stand !
where's the betting table?
can't you fly faster , much faster?
it's impossible .
engine would blow .
pilots are all stupid , aren't they ...
hey , fio .
did you see my punch?
i'm gonna take him down next round .
i'll take you down this time .
porco , hang on !
i'll make prosciutto out of you !
take aim !
come on , you chicken !
you are the chicken !
you seduce all women around you .
that was my word .
choose gina or fio , either one !
what?
don't choose both .
gina is ...
don't say , gina , gina ...
gina loves you , pig .
she is ... waiting for you ... at the garden !
porco !
the sound of drum .
it's over !
look at that !
i can see it .
the ltalian air force hasn't arrived , yet .
you are unfair ...
you're a dirty liar .
don't you understand , you idiot .
i am not telling a lie ...
i don't give fio to you .
that's gina's plane .
it's an emergency signal .
1 , 2 ...
the winner is the one who stand up first .
everybody , let me through .
6 , 7 , gina , don't .
8 !
marco , marco , can you hear me?
do you want another girl to be unhappy?
9 !
porco !
porco !
porco , thank you !
well ...
this party is over .
the air force will be here soon .
everybody run away quickly , please .
then stop by my restaurant .
i will serve you all .
everybody , let's go !
it's over , mr.
hey , boss , hurry up !
shut up !
i don't like the pig , but i like you .
goodbye !
thank you .
take a shower sometimes , will you?
thank you , too , mr. curtis .
next time i'll propose you formally , not as a bet .
o. k. but i've made up my mind already .
you , get on gina's plane .
no !
no !
i'm going on porco's plane .
you said i'm your partner , didn't you .
gina .
take her home , please .
you always do this .
i'm sorry .
please leave .
let's go .
the ltalian air force is finally coming .
do you want to help me?
i'm going to lead them astray .
wait , the face !
let me see your face !
your plane is over there , eh?
let me see it a little bit !
after the flight from the air force ,
i returned to milan .
i haven't seen porco since .
instead , i have found a very good friend in miss gina .
since the of the fight , there have been many wars .
but i still keep in touch with gina .
after i take over the factory 'piccolo ',
i make it a rule to spend summer vacations at the hotel adriano .
miss gina has become more beautiful since .
old friends still stop by the hotel all the time .
mr. curtis , now i recall , writes to me sometimes though he is not the president of the u. s. , yet .
he says he longs for the summer of adriatic sea .
it's only our secret that gina won her gamble ...
end thank you for watching
