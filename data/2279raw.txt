don't give up .

redhead .
luther .
your life would be a whole lot simpler if you could learn to operate a vcr .
true .
truer words were never spoken .
what's that?

that is nice .
it's okay .
he's not here .
anyway , i told him that i was sick .

no choice in the matter , sir .

jesus , tim .
what do we do?
no choice in the matter .
what the hell was that?
oh , shit .
oh , my god .
oh , my god .
do you realize what a shitstorm we're in?
go on , tell me .
nothing to tell .
he screamed for help .
you heard no sounds of violence till then?
nothing we haven't heard before .
maybe i should call the police .
oh , jesus .
what?
bill ... ... why don't you think about that .
just take a second ... ... and think about that .
think real ... ... fucking ... ... hard .
probably not a good idea .
here's what happened .
poor christy ... ... came home alone and interrupted a burglary .
sound logical?
yeah , sure .
we have to sanitize this place .
alan .
did you have sex with her?
i don't know .
bill , you're gonna have to examine her .
i'm no gynecologist .
i just made you one .
christ !
i'll take that .
it has both fingerprints .
thanks for sharing .
gloria .
gloria .
did i kill her?
everything's gonna be fine , alan .
don't worry about it .
oh , god .
now be careful .
just don't get blood on you .
i'll take care of everything , okay?
just like i always do .
oh , shit .
what?
madame's purse .
miss russell , let me get him .
thank you .
i got him .
all right .
nice and easy , sir .
oh , my god !
no knife !
what?
where's the knife?
in the bedroom .
come on .
get up there !
shit !
shit !
go !
excuse me .
i got the number .
gee , guys , maybe it was the bogeyman .
check under the bed .
you may have buried us !
i got his license number .
you think he'll sit around waiting for us?
look , take it easy .
everybody , shut up , all right?
what have you got?
oh , boy .
two way mirror .
we better get cracking on that license number .
that's all we've got .
he's got the letter opener .
blood ... ... fingerprints .
jesus !
think what he can do .
the man's a thief .
a thief who witnessed a murder .
it looks like he stole a whole bunch of money .
i'll tell you what he's gonna do .
he's gonna run like hell .
they beat us by seven .
by seven?
who'd have thought that?
kate .
kate .
i guess it'd be a little late for me .
the jogging , i mean .
kind of dumb way to start .
but i did want to talk to you .
about?
the weather , actually .
it's getting cool in the evenings .
that happens this time of year .
i was thinking ... ... of moving to a kinder , more gentle climate .
i thought i'd talk with you , since you're the only family i have .
luther , you don't have me .
you know what it's like to be the only kid ... ... who got to talk about visiting day?
this move , it would be a permanent one , you understand .
we never see each other anyway .
we haven't since mom died .
that's a year .
look , you chose your life .
you had that right .
you were never around for me .
fine .
i have no plans to be around for you .
wait a minute .
wait .
you're lying , aren't you?
are you active again?
is that why you're here now?
i don't believe you .
oh , christ !
father , what have you done?
christy sullivan?
wife of walter .
most likely came home , stumbled onto a burglary .
some burglary .
i wish my carpets were this clean .
i couldn't find a single fingerprint .
are you serious , laura?
it's like mary poppins was here .
where's mr. sullivan?
sorry , seth .
the entire sullivan household went to barbados two days ago .
thanks for your support .
oh , no , wait .
it gets worse .
the shots came from here .
if she stumbled on a burglary , she should've been here .
but she was killed exactly where she is .
see , the blood patterns indicate that .
what is she doing here?
looks like someone sat here , but i couldn't find any prints .
so you think old man sullivan holed up in this chair ... ... and watched his wife perform?
god , i hope not .
for his sake .
you know , he's such a great man .
be careful digging that out .
looks like he tried to strangle her .
then he went to the door to shoot her from behind?
he also inspected her vagina .
he did what?
why?
maybe he didn't remember that he did her .
a strong burglar with a weak mind .
obviously , it's another open and shut case .
we can expect tomorrow's temperatures ... ... to climb into the 70s with lows around 50 .
turner will start things off for the cougars .
one man to beat .
he's going all the way !
nothing but clear sailing now .
six points !
mr. sullivan .
sorry to bother you .
i'm seth frank , senior homicide detective , middletown county .
my client is in no mood for conversations .
it's all right , sandy .
you're in charge of the case?
yes , sir .
i've gotta ask you a few questions .
what do you want?
positive identification?
yes ... ... that was my wife .
anything else?
you'd been in barbados for two days .
i took the staff , always do this time of year .
your wife didn't come with you .
well , she was .
had it all planned .
but you know women .
she changed her mind .
i'd been married to my rebecca for 47 years .
when she died ... ... i decided i never wanted that pain again .
one thing i knew about christy ... ... she was going to outlive me .
i think that's enough for today .
sir , i have to ask you about the vault .
you mean , the contents of the vault , of course .
sandy , you go on .
walter .
no , really .
i'm all right .
you go on to the reception .
obviously , i can't make it .
i'm sure everyone will understand .
you don't mean the contents .
you mean the chair .
you must ask about the chair .
yes , sir .
i do .
why?
are they connected?
someone sat in it and may have been involved in the murder .
i have the deepest respect for you .
i'm sorry to have to do this .
i promise you , none of this will make my highlight reel .
well , i hoped i could satisfy her .
but , you know ... ... she had needs .
she didn't want to go behind my back .
she suggested the chair .
she hoped i might get to like sitting there .
i didn't .
for 80 years , i've tried to live ... ... a decent life .
i've given a billion dollars to charity .
if this comes to trial ... ... none of that will be remembered .
i'll just go out ... ... the joke of the world .
i understand , sir .
i'll do what i can .
would you listen to me whine?
i apologize , mr. frank .
just do your job and i'll try to do mine .
yes , sir .
i'm sorry , sir .
ladies and gentlemen , the president .
sandy .
mr. president .
take a walk with me .
certainly , sir .
tell me about walter .
how is he?
well , he's 80 and alone , mr. president .
he understands that officially my hands are tied .
yes , but he's very moved by your concern , sir .
any news of the killer?
why isn't there?
who's in charge of this?
the top man .
he spent eight years , homicide work in new york .
i understand how you feel .
it's hard to be patient .
no one understands how i feel .
i'm supposed to have all this power ... ... and i can't even help my oldest friend .
you and i know , more than any man alive , walter sullivan put me here .
now when he needs me most ...
well , he must feel abandoned .
i'll have a press conference .
i'll have walter come and i'll embrace him in front of the world .
he'll treasure that .
what a generous gesture .
thank you , sir .
thank you .
tennis elbow .
this is getting worse , gloria .
i need to see a doctor .
the country would have to be informed , mr. president .
what happened to my rights to privacy?
i think she nicked a tendon .
burton says it's a flesh wound .
since when did you become an expert , bill?
you ever been wounded?
yes , sir .
a few times .
you're serious about this press conference?
of course i am .
walter's like a father to me .
shall i bring mrs. richmond home?
i don't think mrs. richmond's mission ... ... to help the poor in asia needs to be interrupted .
what do we know so far?
we've checked his license plates .
he stole the car from a police impoundment lot .
we're not dealing with a fool , are we?
has he initiated contact?
burton doesn't think he will .
i agree .
i apologize for my behavior .
consider it a blip on the screen .
as far as i'm concerned , that's all he is .
he could be a little more than that , alan .
he saw .
he saw nothing .
he saw a drunk woman who liked rough sex too much .
he's a burglar .
who's gonna believe him?
after all , it's not as if he has any evidence .
he's a burglar .
who 's gonna believe him?
after all , it's not as if he has any evidence .
boy , you always did disappear good , luther .
you're trying to say i have a weak face?
no , i'm saying you're lucky .
some customers , no matter what i do , still stand out .
how many passports you want?
four ought to do the trick .
you want different looks , matching international driver's licenses .
i'll throw in dummy credit cards .
how are the rugs i made you holding up?
good .
the mustaches and the beards also .
we try to give quality for our money .
you leaving the country for permanent?
that could be .
does it matter where you've been?
i hate doing asian passport stamps .
no .
make it european .
caribbean in the wintertime .
how long is all this gonna take?
it usually takes time .
for you , i'll rush it .
you're always dependable , valerie .
listen , luther ... ... i don't wanna know what you're into .
i do , but i'm not gonna ask you .
but leaving the country forever ...
what is it?
i never figured you for a runner .
thirty percent of my runners kill themselves within five years .
right now , five years doesn't sound too bad .
take care .
see you .
okay , see if this makes any sense .
i am christy sullivan .
i come in and i surprise a burglar .
okay , now you're the surprised burglar coming from the vault .
gold star .
i draw my gun .
boom .
then why strangle her when you could just shoot her?
why do i bother to strip her and put her clothes back on?
there , i can help you out .
you used to be a dry cleaner and you love beautiful clothes .
thanks a lot .
and you dress her because ...
she was a good customer and you didn't want her embarrassed when police came .
she had a 0 . 21 blood alcohol level .
not that it matters .
she didn't drive .
the chauffeurs , they keep exact mileage on these cars .
they haven't been driven since they went to barbados .
i checked every cab and limo service in the area .
somebody drove her home .
who?
why haven't they come forward?
maybe because whoever drove her home killed her .
maybe .
i love this case .
lieutenant?
sorry to bother you , but the phone problems?
i took care of them .
thanks .
just part of the job .
i hate people who say that .
it is your fucking job .
remember the bullet hole in the wall?
guess what?
no slug .
why take a slug out of the wall when there's one stuck in her head?
different from the one in her body?
two different guns means two burglars .
two guys broke in?
they both went out the window?
bullshit .
by the way ... ... why did he or they go out the window anyway ... ... when he or they got in by breaking a zillion dollar security system?
bill burton from secret service in the parking lot .
thanks , bob .
what's he doing in the parking lot?
bill burton .
hi .
hi .
seth frank .
to what do i owe the honor?
you must be going crazy ... ... but the boss is interested about your progress .
maybe we could help each other .
what do you have in mind?
well , you know how close he and sullivan are , right?
the minute anything breaks ... ... i'll tell the president .
he'd be the first to alert mr. sullivan .
it'd mean a lot to him .
any red tape you want cut , done .
here's my numbers .
any leads?
we're still figuring out what happened .
i love playing sherlock holmes .
you guys do that?
i was a state trooper before the government got me .
wait .
you're that bill burton?
i was younger and dumber then .
i was younger .
i'm dumber now .
keep in touch .
my chef makes them especially for me .
i promise you , they're sinful .
you're a salesman , mr. sullivan .
this is a new arena for me .
but from what i'm told , you have a flawless reputation .
which is why i need to employ you , mr. mccarty .
understood .
i don't know who it is i'm after yet .
until i do ... ... you wait in washington for instructions .
that's out of the question .
mine is not creative work .
i do it because i enjoy living beyond my means .
i can't afford to sit around .
my father died when i was 10 years old .
he was a miner .
he died of lung disease .
i became rich at 25 .
the first thing i did was buy that mine , close it down ... ... and give every miner $50, 000 to retire on .
you will wait in washington , mr. mccarty .
and i will put one million dollars 'expenses ... ... in a swiss bank of your choosing .
and when the time comes ... ... 2 million dollars a bullet .
you are a salesman , sir .
selling sin is easy .
who is he?
it's luther whitney ... ... one of the great thieves of the world .
i've been going nuts .
i was up all night .
i remembered your notion how it was two burglars .
around dawn , i thought , " what if it's not two burglars ... ... but just one guy trying to make it look like two?
i called my buddy at the bureau .
they keep track .
there's only half a dozen guys who could've done the sullivan job .
i've been tracing all six .
whitney's the only guy that lives here .
why haven't i ever heard of him?
he hasn't been arrested in 30 years .
what's this?
his graduation picture from harvard?
that's history .
he was just a punk , part of a gang .
three time loser .
since he got out last ... ... no one's touched him .
when something big comes up , they question him , but nothing sticks .
oh , seth .
we can make this stick .
i bet you he's our guy .
he's a local .
you can't ask for anything more .
well , we got a problem .
what?
he hasn't killed anyone in 45 years .
korea .
so what?
he's a veteran .
not just a veteran , he's a wounded veteran .
i got his war record here .
battles , commendations , decorations up the kazoo .
he lives alone on disability .
that's what he says anyway .
but i don't see him as a killer .
he's just a great thief .
and besides , i don't do war heroes .
boy , you must be smart .
pardon me?
it usually takes you guys a week to get to me .
oh , seth frank .
i recognize your picture from the newspaper .
luther whitney .
nice to meet you .
would you like a signed confession now or do you want coffee first?
before i send you away for life , i should probably check out your alibi .
i was watching a football game with an old friend , red bransford .
he owns a saloon here in town .
you can ask me about the game .
i could be lying .
you been following the case?
yeah , i have .
i love true crime .
fbi says there's only a few guys who could have handled this job .
i got a list here .
you're on it .
how i wish it were true .
this person , they go in the front door ... ... and out a window , down a rope in the middle of the night?
now , if i could do something like that ... ... i'd be the star of my aarp meetings .
what's that?
the american ...
association of retired persons .
luther , why was this so difficult?
you want me to help you solve your case?
just looking for insight .
how would you ...?
scratch that .
how would one go about it?
what kind of person should i look for?
except for the rope trick , an older person , like me .
because?
well , you need patience .
the secret is research , research and research .
i've read that .
what kind of research?
well , from what i saw on the tube , this is a rather large home .
must be an architectural office .
you'd go to the library , go through public records ... ... find out where that architectural office is and break in .
and then you xerox the plans and get them back by morning .
why not just steal them?
anyone can break into an office , but doing it ... ... without having people know you were there is the trick .
then there's the general contractor .
and then there's the security company .
do you realize the skill of breaking the security of a security company?
i don't know how those guys do it .
why go to all that trouble , luther?
there's a vault in the house .
there must be a secret way into it .
there was .
that's what i don't get .
how do you mean?
this guy obviously did the research you're talking about .
so why does he take a crowbar ... ... to open the vault when there's a clicker right there?
a clicker?
well , a gizmo , like a vcr remote .
sounds amazing to me .
must've been a lot of valuables in that vault .
close to 5 million total value .
is that funny?
i feel like you're trying to surprise me .
i was trying to .
thank you .
you're welcome .
there you go again .
would the burglar use a disguise?
yeah , he might .
get with the program if you're gonna catch this guy .
it is a guy we think , anyway .
some sort of a loner?
weirdo?
maybe like you .
well , i'd be the perfect prototype , actually .
except you see a face around long enough and put things together .
that's why these top guys have disguises .
some of them , i even understand , become makeup experts ... ... hire wigmakers and things like that .
go on about the wigmakers .
i would ...
i've gotta go have my pacemaker checked .
it's been so exciting talking to you .
you don't have a pacemaker .
i'll be back tomorrow .
tomorrow is promised to no one .
goodbye .
pacemaker , my ass .
oh , katie .
you gotta start eating better than this , darling .
i'm having this press conference here ... ... because it is here , at this courthouse ... ... that christine sullivan's killer will be tried .
as you know , i came from an impoverished family ... ... in an impoverished town .
we lived with our doors ... ... unlocked .
we all lock our doors now .
that's not what concerns me .
a ginger ale .
we are also locking our hearts .
could you turn that off?
that is the sadness .
in a second .
that ... ... is the loss .
we are locking our hearts to the weary .
we are locking our hearts ... ... to the poor and their pain .
sisters and brothers ... ... we are locking our hearts to ourselves .
turn it back on .
but you said ...
i know ... ... but turn it on .
we feel that savagery and violence must be allowed a place at table .
that is wrong .
that is not america .
i shall fight that battle .
dear friend ... ... old friend ...
... we shall fight that battle .
who can explain chance?
if we had not met ... ... i would not be president today .
if christine had not taken ill ... ... she would be with you in barbados even now .
walter , you've been like a father to me .
i would give the world to lessen your pain .
thank you .
you heartless whore .
i'm not about to run from you .
thomas jefferson used the green room as a dining room .
the walls are covered with green silk ... ... just as they were when james monroe was president .
many valuable objects and paintings in this room .
we'll move on to the blue room .
james hoban built the blue room as an oval ... ... to please president washington .
during the holiday season ... ... the white house christmas tree stands in the middle .
the view from the window includes the jefferson memorial .
we'll be moving on to the red room .
the walls of the red room are covered with red silk .
he was in the building .
he took a guided tour .
i've never dealt with blackmail before .
he doesn't want money .
you're a mind reader too now .
no , i just looked on the back .
see?
i don't want money .
he has the guts of a burglar .
wish we had him .
finished your recruiting speech?
because i'd like to know how i handle this .
like you handled the letter opener?
gee , bill ... ... that could be construed as criticism .
you want me for an enemy?
i should've called the police that night but i was weak .
you convinced me to stay silent .
i regret that .
every time i see your face , i wanna rip your throat out .
fine .
you win the pissing contest .
what do i do?
nothing .
he's making a mistake .
he thinks he has time .
he doesn't .
seth frank's too good .
he'll bring him in .
then what?
then i kill him .
miss whitney?
thanks .
miss whitney?
i'm seth frank .
excuse me .
thanks .
for a tough prosecutor , you sure don't resemble your reputation .
is that good or bad?
i don't know .
look , lieutenant , i told you on the phone .
i'm not involved with my father .
so this is a waste of time .
do you expect me to walk out of here?
all right .
all right .
your father disappeared .
i need your help .
look .
lieutenant , i don't know the man .
he was in jail .
when he got out , my mom and i lived by ourselves .
he doesn't care about me .
i've seen him once this past year .
yeah , when?
a few days ago .
he said he might leave town .
i helped you .
can i work now?
any idea where he went?
quit wasting my time .
he doesn't want you to find him , you won't .
you're saying he skipped the country?
i'm saying you won't recognize him .
he could be right around the corner .
he always had a safe house .
where?
he never said .
how do you know he had one?
my mother loved him , all right?
even after she left him , when she was dying , he was all she talked about .
if only he hadn't done this .
lf only he hadn't done that . " what else?
how long has he lived here?
years .
never been .
this is a strange place for a thief to leave a key .
he always did that .
he left in a hurry .
i wonder what scares a professional thief like that .
he wasn't at these places .
my college graduation ... ... my law school graduation , the night my mother and i ... ... we went out to celebrate because i'd gotten my first job .
me alone on the steps .
i'd won my first case .
i used to think sometimes ...
sometimes i'd come home and could sense that he'd been in the apartment .
that he'd checked the fridge , shook his head because i never ate right .
i mean , i know it sounds crazy , but i've always ...
i've always felt that he was around .
you can do a good thing .
help me bring him in .
leave a message you're worried about him .
no .
it's true .
you're worried .
this is no normal case .
his life is in danger .
you call , you could save him .
he won't come .
of course he'll come .
you're all he has .
he's on the run and he's scared because he'll get caught .
you don't know the heat .
he's not a murderer .
maybe he is innocent .
if that's true , i'll have him home in a few hours .
what if a hotshot trying to make a reputation tracks him down?
i can guarantee his safety .
you make the call , i'll make a promise .
you'll have him back .
seth frank .
hi .
i left a message on his machine .
he called me back within the hour and i'm meeting him tomorrow .
where?
open air place near my office , cafe alonzo .
what time?
four o 'clock .
it'll be deserted then .
sounds good .
thanks a lot .
bye .
bye bye .
dad , hi .
it's kate calling .
i was wondering if you could call me , please .
there's some things i'd like to talk with you about ... ... and maybe even get together , if that's possible .
okay?
thanks and talk to you soon .
bye .
dad , hi .
it's kate calling .
i was wondering if you could call me , please .
there's some things i'd like to talk with you about ... ... and maybe even get together .
so you all know where and when you're supposed to be there .
he's slippery .
he's an eel .
he gets a whiff of a cop , he disappears .
nobody moves until i order you .
then we move in on him .
expect whitney to show up at 4 .
his daughter will be waiting for him .
it's important to stay in your positions ... ... until you hear the order to move in on him .
here you go .
could i have some cream?
gather around , gentlemen .
nobody moves till the suspect's in place .
any questions?
see you at the alonzo .
boss is grateful .
he'd appreciate an eyewitness at the capture .
this is our guy .
if he isn't , he sure disappeared fast .
see you there .
tums?
i got my own .
come on , kate .
she gonna show?
yeah , she'll be here .
miss?
what you want , please?
nothing .
thank you .
got to .
pardon?
you sit , you eat , please .
jeez , this guy wasn't part of my master plan .
unbelievable .
i'm waiting for someone .
oh , he must eat too , please .
he will .
we will .
we're gonna ...
we'll order half the menu .
just not now .
maybe that's him disguised as a chinaman .
check out this guy in the hat .
i believe that's our man .
all units , suspect's approaching .
stay in place .
wait for my signal .
i did not kill her .
i want you to believe that .
just hold on .
let him get settled .
you've gotta believe that .
i think we're ready .
damn it !
almost .
you okay?
what was that?
anyone see where those came from?
did you do that?
no , we didn't do it !
anyone see where those shots came from?
where's whitney?
quit standing around here !
go find him !
take it easy .
take it easy .
take it easy , now .
stay calm .
stay calm .
there's no reason to panic .
if everyone will just kindly take it easy .
messy .
i like that in a woman .
here .
i got a few numbers here .
the top one's ... ... iocal police .
that's my office , my home , beeper .
i live alone too .
you can call anytime .
want me to get someone to stay here?
no , i wanna get some sleep .
surveillance is outside until it's over .
i've got a feeling he'll contact you .
you're on a hot streak , i guess .
listen , i'm sorry .
anything unusual at all ... ... call right away .
it's not a bother .
i live alone .
you said .
feeble .
you want something for the road?
i got water and water .
deal .
a pellegrino would be great .
what's so funny?
i say it wrong?
i'm tired .
i'm just tired .
listen ... ... there's one thing ... ... i forgot to tell you .
i live alone .
lock up behind me .
how's that?
real good .
now get some sleep .
thank you .
i betrayed you twice , luther .
you should know that .
you're not the first .
why'd you come?
i can't have my daughter thinking i was a murderer .
no , i mean this afternoon .
why'd you come?
you suspected something or you wouldn't have prepared .
my daughter wanted to see me .
the robbery was going fine until they came in .
they were drunk .
i was hidden in the vault .
and the sex had started getting rough ... ... and he started beating her ... ... started strangling her .
i thought he'd kill her .
then she somehow got the upper hand .
she was gonna stab him with a letter opener and two guys shot her .
the same two guys who tried for you today .
possibly .
unless walter sullivan was taking a shot .
it's a pretty powerful enemy .
that's very good going .
not as powerful as the president of the united states .
that's right .
alan richmond , he was the drunk .
the two guys were secret service .
chief of staff russell handled the cover up .
well , then you go to the police .
that's what innocent people do .
they go to the police .
sure .
that young man who was here ... ... he'd believe me over the president , right?
why should i believe you?
because i swear to you , kate .
i swear to you on mattie's grave .
that's right .
your mother's grave .
i'd kill myself before i'd lie about that .
oh , jesus , luther .
yeah .
i know .
they'll kill you .
i know .
can you run?
i was all set to .
i was at the airport ready to go .
then there was that press conference .
and there was richmond using old man sullivan .
you know , i might not have been able to ... ... save christy sullivan ... ... but i didn't even try .
what are you gonna do?
i'll think of something .
i watched you argue a case last year .
you won it .
thank god you got your mother's brains .
dangerous outside .
it always is .
excuse me .
could you give this to gloria russell?
anything for me to sign?
no , you have an honest face .
oh , my god .
you're a vision tonight .
thank you , mr. president .
and thank you , mr. president .
for ...?
come again .
you know .
you sent it to me this afternoon .
of course .
would you excuse me , all?
i'm overcome with a desire to dance with my chief of staff .
look after this for me , would you?
what is this nonsense?
i'm hoping there's an explanation .
your gift , alan .
i was ... ... overwhelmed .
and , you know , your note was so gratifying .
i sent a note?
yes , yes .
you think i don't know your writing?
i assumed you wanted me to wear it tonight .
gloria , it's lovely .
yes .
and you know what else?
what , alan?
christy wore it the night she was killed .
know what this means?
no .
whitney's been heard from .
it's not precisely the first time .
you been keeping things from me?
well , it's just that you have so much on your plate .
we wanted to spare you .
he sent me a polaroid ... ... of the letter opener yesterday .
i have to give this some thought .
come to my office in the morning .
this'll make an interesting chapter in my memoirs .
do we know who the forger is?
i talked to seth frank .
apparently , whitney learned how in prison .
a gifted man .
how close are we to him?
we're working around the clock .
well , that's good to know .
he'll make a mistake .
well , that's good to know too .
there is ... ... one other thing ... ... that we need to take care of .
he has a daughter , doesn't he?
you sure you wanna do that?
sir?
she's a young prosecutor .
prosecutors ask questions .
maybe she knows what he knows .
let's get cracking , boys .
show that you love your country .
how's kate doing?
where are you?
i won't hang around for you to trace the call .
just answer the question .
she couldn't be in better hands .
secret service is taking over surveillance .
hello?
hello?
it's entered in the chart .
we upped her from 250 to 500 milligrams .
nurse , i need you right away , please .
he's having a seizure .
dr. kevorkian , i presume .
my guess is that this is right in your carotid artery about now .
you're gonna get a little woozy .
but if i give you the rest ... ... it'll fry your brain down to the size of a peanut .
drop that .
luther ... ... he was my president .
right or wrong .
well , he made a mistake .
you made a mistake .
when you went after my girl , that was entirely unacceptable .
mercy .
i'm fresh out .
daddy?
go to sleep , darling .
oh , jesus !
just one question .
did walter sullivan say why christy didn't go to barbados?
just that she changed her mind .
you know who did it , don't you?
so will you .
check your phones .
good night , mr. sullivan .
you're taking a shortcut , tommy?
i'm your substitute driver tonight .
don't worry about tommy .
he's fine .
very unusual .
what do i call you?
luther , sir .
and are you familiar with how to get to my townhouse , luther?
oh , yes , sir .
i know where all your houses are .
i'm the man who robbed you .
you're the man who tried to kill me .
i'm sorry i missed .
i believe in the old testament , sir .
there's nothing wrong with an eye for an eye ... ... when a terrible deed is done .
a deed such as yours .
you'd like to believe that .
that'd be simple for you to believe that .
what do i have to gain by being here?
i have no idea .
you going to rob me again?
i don't need your money , mr. sullivan .
did you check your vault lately?
i put everything back .
i'm afraid we're a little late for an attempt at leniency .
a lot of crap's coming down tonight , sir .
you wanna be a player or not?
you wanna know what happened or don't you?
because i was there .
i want to know .
you think you can stand hearing about it?
how he beat her , tried to strangle her?
you really wanna know?
i could walk through fire .
i was in the vault when they came in .
they were drunk .
he knocked her around .
she fought back .
he got really rough .
she tried to defend herself .
well , he started screaming ... ... sniveling simp he is .
who else was in my house?
secret service .
they're the ones who shot her .
nonsense .
gloria russell handled the cover up .
stop this !
you wanna know who it was?
it was you .
come on , mr. sullivan .
we're too old to bullshit each other .
who was it , then?
you know .
don't shake your head .
when you're alone and rage takes over and you want revenge ... ... what face do you put with your enemy?
stop the car !
we're going straight ahead .
this is too terrible .
yes , it is .
i know about alan's reputation as a philanderer ... ... but he'd never dream of betraying me .
i gave him the presidency .
remember that press conference?
where he put his arm around you and said ... ... if christy hadn't been sick , she'd have been in barbados with you?
how the hell did he know she was sick?
you didn't tell anyone .
it's because she told him that night .
i was right there watching .
that's not real proof .
well , maybe this is , then .
you could've stolen this .
i did steal it .
but that's not my blood on there and that's not my prints .
mr. sullivan .
i did love her , you know .
jeez , burton .
is he working late?
i don't have an appointment but i want to see him .
you don't need an appointment .
let's go , miss russell .
walter .
come in .
we interrupt with a breaking story ... ... that's shocking the nation and the world .
information just came from the white house about a tragedy within the hour .
we go now to our correspondent .
diane , what can you tell us?
sources tell us walter sullivan had seen president richmond tonight .
that was for an unscheduled private meeting .
you're still here .
i'm still here .
... i would not be president .
if christine had not taken ill ... ... she would be with you in barbados even now .
walter , you've been like a father to me .
this is the president's most recent news conference ... ... where he clearly outlined ... ... his loyalty to philanthropist and friend , sullivan .
the president vowed to find sullivan 's wife's killer .
sullivan had a meeting with the president .
unknown what they discussed .
now to the white house for a live interview .
have you no idea why the president would take his own life?
i know he's been feeling the pressure of office , more than ever , lately .
he talked about it a great deal .
but why would he stab himself?
that's a question that will haunt me forever .
of course i tried to stop him .
alan ... ... was like a son to me .
was that seth?
i think he'd like to come over for supper when you get well .
you don't have to fuss .
i know .
am i gonna be all right?
yeah .
we're gonna be just fine .
