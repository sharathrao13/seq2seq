dad .

your mom's a little eccentric .
think of her as an exotic flower .
and that made you what?
dirt?
nat , she's your mom .
let's get started on this " take your daughter to work" thing .
i'm supposed to interview you , and then write a report for school .
all right , let her rip .
okay .
ah
did you always know you wanted to be a video communications specialist?
actually , at first i wanted to be batman .
but he had no powers .
andaquaman i don't like water .
so spider man that's what i always wanted to be .
dad , this is supposed to be serious .
i really don't know what to say .
i have a really great job .
but to be honest , it's not the job i've always dreamt about having .
i thought you wanted to be a writer .
you're the writer , okay?
i've read your play ten times .
it's amazing !
how come you only wrote one?
writing was a dream i had when i was a kid .
and then i grew up .
but dreams are important to hold on to !
come on !
you're gonna be a great writer .
you have that special spark .
i knowthat , but that spark is gonna go out unless you write .
now write this .
hey , watch it , ass ... guy .
nice save .
you all right?
yeah , i'm fine .
what's his hurry?
he's just a lunatic .
it's so crowded .
i think they manufacture people here .
below , in the basement , they make people .
look , look .
oh , wait , she's pulling out .
hey !
that guy's an ass wipe !
natalie .
sorry .
i meant " ass guy .
that's mark mckinney .
he's a seven year employee .
what's he doing in the ten year lot?
maybe he's gonna stand around for another three years .
no , he's not .
i'll be right back .
excuse me .
mark?
yeah?
yeah , this is a ten year lot .
and you're not a ten year associate , are you?

and this is the last space , and if i don't park here ... my daughter and i will have to come way over from the west lot .
you actually brought your daughter to work?
yeah .
i thought only the mothers were doin 'that .
i'd just appreciate it if you'd park someplace else .
you know what i think , um
what's your name again?
joe scheffer .
i work
joe , i think walking from the west lot ... is probably better than getting your ass kicked in front of your little girl .
wait a minute !
are you like threatening to hit me?

uh huh?
i'm gonna give you to five to get back in your car .
no .
i'm not gonna no .

actually , jeremy , he's a good guy .
i ran into him the other day .
he's quiet , hard working .
maybe a little shaky right now .
he's going through a divorce .
it's really sad .
he kept telling me how great
any work related problems prior to the incident?
he was promised a promotion almost a year ago , and never happened .
so , basically , he's a schmuck .
the guy's a devoted father , a hard worker with nothing but positive reviews .
that makes him a schmuck?
his wife left him .
he was passed over for a promotion ... and he just got bitch slapped in the company parking lot .
i'm gonna go with ... yeah !
so , what are we doin 'about it?
well , " we " have left him several messages .
i'm waiting to hear back
whoa .
that's not enough .
it's been three days .
we're under review .
the efficiency nazis are all over us .
employees fighting in the parking lot sort of undercuts ... the company wellness program , if you know what i mean .
do you think i'm not doing my job?
it doesn't matter what i think .
but what if he decides to sue?
what if he sues the living daylights ... out of the company for failure to create a safe work environment , or , uh , uh , emotional distress?
but you and me , meg ...
megs , we're on the same page .
we're the " a " team .
we can make this go away .

have you , uh , left the house at all in the past three days?
i had some cleaning to do .
mm hmm .
i can see that .
is that it's bleach , huh?
it's the only thing that really gets the stains out .
would you hold that for a minute?
sure .
um , joe .
we'd really like for you to come back to work .
you and i can work through this thing together .
do you think this will dry darker than the rest of the ceiling?
if this drys darker , then i'm gonna notice this stain .
i'm always gonna look at this stain .
i'd have to paint the whole ceiling .
i might as well do that right now .
joe , could you please slow down for a minute?
i would really like to talk to you about this .
what's in the bag?
is that bottles?
no !
oh !
i'm gonna need more bleach .
i would really like to help you .
please ... joe .
he took something from me .
your parking space .
but it's not exactly your parking space that he took , is it , joe?
yes , it's exactly that .
it's my parking space .
how 'bout when you come back to work , we give you an assigned space , huh?
i can't go back .
why not , joe?
would you mind not saying my name so much?
maybe you could just come in for a couple of hours
i'm sorry ...

what do i want?
i need you to come back .
joe?
joe?
you're having a panic attack .
joe , do you know what that means?
it ... sounds ... pretty self explanatory .
okay .
it's just it's a chemical misfire .
you're not dying , joe .
ten years in a goddamn cubicle .
then you wake up one day , and then
and i don't have a place to park .
what can i do for you , joe?

i like herbal tea and deepak chopra and people who come back to work .
he's gonna come to his senses , right , meg?
he's not gonna fight .
meg !
besides , it's not like he knows where mckinney lives .
aah !
aah !

hiding in the back of the classroom , not speaking up .

yes , it is .
i just pulled your elementary school records .
what did i find?
straighta's right down the line , baby girl .

i was an overachiever .
i'm settling into my natural groove now .
but you just couldn't " vanilla down " the writing , could you?
in my 15 years as a counselor ,

you were exactly who you were .

my ex wife put a pretty big hole through me , and , uh , it still hurts when the wind blows through .
and you think that by fighting mckinney you can ... close this hole?
maybe .
okay .
night , joe .
night , meg .
joe .
you really shouldn't flirt with someone until you're ready .
okay .
okay .
jeremy .
hold the elevator .
what's going on with joe scheffer?
good morning .
boy , that is a great color on you .
director of internal communications?
oh , well .
what the hell is that?
that position doesn't even exist .
presidential compliance .
what is that?
uh , read your manual .
meg , if joe scheffer stays home ... and pours bourbon on his cereal , he can sue us for negligence , but if he comes back to work , we make him happy .
a reasonable period of time passes , we're free and clear .
he can't sue .
that is presidential compliance .
and what happens after that reasonable period?
what happens to his job , to him?
i don't know !
who cares?
i do .
i'm afraid i'm going to have to let you go .
mr. scheffer?
hmm?
yes?
i'm deidre , your executive assistant .
i have an executive assistant?
yes . and her name is deidre .
right .
would you like to see your office?
i've been looking at it .
this isn't it .
you have a thing for the a v guy?
no .
no , i don't .
yeah .
no .
see , 'cause i always thought , uh , you know , you and i , we
do you think that we should be discussing
discussing?
this?
here .
you're right .
you're absolutely right .
let's stop wasting time .
tonight , let's go to grumpy's .
get some margaritas , maybe some ribs , have some fun .
what do you say?
jeremy , that's never gonna happen .
oh .
that's fine .
jeremy , look .
no , i get it , about about joe .
you don't care about him , but you care about him .
it's your job .
you're the wellness coordinator .
you care about his wellness .
actually , there's  stop for a second , meg .
you remember why your little wellness program even exists?
i am here to help
to keep corporate objectives .
that's the only reason you're here .
you're here to make people believe we care .
i'm a propagandist?
yeah .
you're a propagandist .
presidential compliance , meg .
you tell anyone about our conversation , and you can start sending out your resume .
we were never under review , were we?
oh , yeah !
we're under review , meg .
we're all under review all the time .
and that includes , uh , your boyfriend , scheffer .
what the hell is that supposed to mean?
you'll see .
wow !
oh , it's too much .
you've come a long way , haven't you , joe?
just look at this .
this is great .
just when you get to think that no one appreciates your work ,
that nobody  great , so here's the deal .
mckinney's due back next week , so your big day is almost here .
a small problem , though .
what's the small problem?
the company is posting security guards in the parking lot for the foreseeable future ... so that fight is not gonna happen here , joe .
but it has to .
i know .
this is your 15 minutes of fame .
what do you mean , 15 minutes?
it's a cliche .
maybe you'll get 20 .
i don't know .
oh .
what if
what if what if
what if somebody
what if ah , here .
thank you .
what if somebody could change the venue?
what if the fight actually happened in a schoolyard?
how cool would that be?
could you do that?
no , i couldn't , uh , officially ... do anything .
well , why would you , not officially , do this?
because i know how you feel , joe .
i was nobody too .
guys like mckinney used me to limber up for real fights .
if i had a shot at a guy like that now , i would
i envy you , joe .
i really do .
frank .
go long , buddy , go long .
thanks , joe .
you're randy moss today , buddy !
wow .
is it hot in here , or is it that outfit , linda?
how about some fresh grapefruit?
thank you , joe .
meg , you never saw my new office .
oh , yeah , you know , i've been really busy .
you want some fruit?
uh
joe , squash tomorrow?
yeah , but let's find some players that can actually play .
i hear that .
i've gotta get going .
home?
oh , no .

this is yours?
well , mine and the bank's .
come on .
get in .
careful .
this is me .
that lumina?
i don't know who that was .
this is me .
i'm glad to see you so happy , joe .
really .
are you mad at me?
this is my problem .
i'm gonna work it out .
wait a minute .
meg , come on .
when i had a problem , you helped me work it out .
did i?
yeah .
now that there's a problem with you , i wanna be here for you .
i wanted to be a guidance counselor .
okay .
i wanted to help girls like me .
girls who were too busy cleaning the house or paying bills ... to do homework or join the pep squad .
but i thought i should make a little money first , right?
you know , put something aside .
before i knew it , i was waking up in a better apartment .
i was going on vacation to places like saint barts ,
and i had a 401k !
meg .
we all like nice stuff .
did i tell you that caddy has 12 speakers in it?
and you can adjust the  i gotta go .
seriously , meg .
if you need to talk again , you know where i live .
thanks , joe .
for what?
i don't think i helped you very much .
you know , i don't think i helped you that much either .
stretch , stretch .

open the coat .
no .

so, you're in your room , watching tv , and it suddenly occurs to you .
what i really want to do ... is put on a teddy and an overcoat and chew some gum .
it didn't really come to me like that .
first i put on the teddy , and i got cold , so i , uh
natalie , just give me the key .
not a chance .
you wanna back up and run over him again , at least you'll have to knock first .
i am not going to run over your father .
i miss him .
where's actor boy?
actor boy's gone .
he left this afternoon .
his loss .
i i feel so alone .
how can you feel alone?
i'm here .
hey .
i'm supposed to be the mother .
oh , you're a mother , all right .
joe , joe , joseph .
hey , people are going nuts about this fight .
they say you got a trainer .
some kung fu guy?
jeremy , i'm really not in the mood for this , okay?
give me something here .
what are we talking about?
the fight .
i can make a ton of money .
there's three to one odds against you showing up .
hmm?
you're gonna show up on monday , right , joe?
where's meg?
oh , oh !
she quit .
she quit?
yeah , she was coming unglued .
everything was a drama .
a whole " psycho femmo " nervous breakdown .
she was smoking .
people were complaining .
i'll tell you , i was gettin'uncomfortable .
there was all this ... sexual tension between us .
there was what?
oh, yeah, yeah .
we had a a thing .
you and meg?
yeah , yeah .
corporate retreat , cancun .
she's very hot .
skinny , but hot .
you want the details?
we're poolside , she wants me to
nah .
i don't want the details .
no?
hello?
i'm looking for meg harper , apartment 508 .
oh .
she's up on the roof .
are you sure?
son , i'm an 82 year old man , and she's a 31 year old woman .
trust me .
i know where she is .
i heard you had a nervous breakdown and quit .
nervous breakdown?
do we need to review who the psycho is here?
oh .
i need more bleach .
i need more bleach .
gotta have more bleach .
that's what jeremy said .
he also said that ... you slept with him .
oh !
does that bother you?
yeah .
never happened .
if jeremy chained me to a bed ,
i'd set myself on fire .
why'd you quit?
um , well , i am the new assistant guidance counselor ... at pembroke high school .
i know .
it's kind of a huge cut in pay .
i think i may have to give them money , actually , but
this is wonderful .
you're great with kids .
and you'll have an opportunity to show them that victory dance .
yeah , okay .
thanks , joe .
joe you can't fight .
it's not right .
if you lay a finger on mckinney ... in that parking lot , they can fire you .
jeremy moved the fight .
we're not fighting in the parking lot .
he wants to see you get your ass kicked .
nobody's gonna get their ass kicked .
let it go .
and no one is gonna get fired .
everybody loves me over there .
uh huh .
then where were they before?
if i back out , i will never know who i am .
you are the guy that admitted to me that your ex wife put a hole in you ... so big that it still burns when the wind blows through .
the guy who kept helping me even after he had stapled his sleeve ...
the guy who kept helping me even after he had stapled his sleeve ... to a " choose happiness " banner .
you mean the guy that got his ass kicked in the parking lot?
no , no .
i mean the guy that kept getting up every morning , being a father to his daughter that's the guy that you are .
i was nobody .
you have no idea what i'd be giving up if i don't fight .
i know what you would be giving up if you do .
i'm sorry , meg .
i have to fight .
yeah?
because you're afraid not to .
okay , okay , okay !
you ... are winded !
you take five !
you're killing yourself .
water?
is there a beer in there?
how come you got out of doing movies?
i guess i kind of turned into an unbearable shit .
aren't there a lot of people like that in this business?
yeah .
but it helps if you've got something that nobody can live without .
you know something funny?
when my first picture became a hit , there were a whole lot of people just lined up waiting to kiss my ass .
then when the movies started to tank , well you know , they lined up behind somebody else's ass .
well
you gotta have people in your life who are there for you .
whether you're somebody or not .
did you find somebody like that?
nope .
it's 6 : 30 .

i'm not afraid not to fight .
a parking space isn't worth fighting for .
you're worth fighting for .
you have a gift for helping , because you saw something in me when i lost sight of myself .
you're what i want .
i don't think there's anything about you that i don't like .
my ears aren't perfectly even .
i like that .
