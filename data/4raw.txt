tom .
tom , where are the magazines?
they got held up at the printers .
i saw you selling them .
oh , that's right .
they didn't review me , did they?
no , they ... reviewed you all right .
it's poetry , page 1 1 .
essentially commercial .
bourgeois poetic .
nakedly ambitious .
it's not very flattering .
who the hell do they think they are?
well , you can ask them yourself if you want .
there's a launch party at the women's union tonight .
8 : 00 .
where is he?

the one who wrote it .
what , that stuff about you?
no .
the one who wrote " fallgrief s girlfriend .
this edward hughes .
ted .
he's over there .
i read your poems .
what?
as soon as i saw them , i knew they were the real thing .
great , big , crashing poems .
not blubbering baby stuff like the others .
they're colossal .
magnificent .
great blowing winds on steel girders .
you like?
i like .
oh , most dear , unscratchable diamond .
who the hell are you?
sylvia plath .
sylvia plath .

i have an obligation in the other room .

black marauder .

it's a bit morbid , isn't it?
he's my black marauder .
well , don't get your hopes up .
why?
what have you heard?
him and his crowd , all they care about is poetry .
anything else is a distraction .
including steady girlfriends .
even pretty american ones ... with fulbright scholarships and red bicycles .

ted hughes called for her .
you're late .
he was here .
who?
your black marauder .
him and his little playmate , legless , chucking clods at my window .
thought it was yours apparently .
what did he say?
nothing comprehensible .
sylvia , he left an address .
the chief defect of henry king was chewing little bits of string .
at last he swallowed some which tied itself in ugly knots inside .
physicians of the utmost fame were called at once " [ ted ]
no , no , no .
it's it's magic .
it's not about magic .
it's not like magic .
it is magic .
" when henry with his latest breath , cried , 'oh , my friends " '
it's real magic .
it's not conjuring tricks ...
or pulling rabbits out ofbloody hats .
bugger !
incantations , spells , ceremonies , rituals wh what are they?
they're poems .
but if it comes to slaughter
so what's a poet?
he's a shaman , that's what he is .
or she .
" now in injia's sunny clime , where i used to spend my time " a fucking good poem is a weapon .
it's and not like a a popgun or something .
" it was 'din !
din !
din ! " 'it's a bomb .
it's like a bloody big bomb .
that's why they make children learn them in school .
hitherao !
water , get it . !
panee lao !
they don't want them messing about with them on their own .
i mean, just imagine if a sonnet went off accidentally .
boom .
drink . !
drink . !
bollocks .
sylvia .
come on , sylvia .
go on . just get up .
give us some of your american poetry .
go on .
if it be you that stir these daughters 'hearts ...
against their father ,
let not women's weapons , water drops , stain my cheeks . !
" no , you unnatural hags , i will have such revenges on you both ...
faster ! " that all the world shall i will do such things
" what they are , yet i know not , but they shall be the terrors of the earth .
faster !
you think i'll weep .
i'll have full cause of weeping : but this heart shall break into a hundred thousand flaws , or ere i'll weep .
o fool , i shall go mad !
come on , ted .
yet herein will i imitate the sun who doth permit the base contagious clouds to smother up his beauty from the world .
that , when he please again to be himself , being wanted , he may be more wondered at ...
by breaking through the foul and ugly mists of vapors that did seem to strangle him .
faster .
and when they seldom come , they wish'd for come , and nothing pleaseth but rare accidents .
so , when this loose behavior i throw off and pay the debt i never promised ,
and , like bright metal on a sullen ground , my reformation , glitt'ring o'er my fault , faster . " shall show more goodly and attract more eyes than that which hath no foil to set it off .
i'll so offend to make offense a skill , redeeming time when men think least i will .
you buggers .
morecambe , again .
okay .
ah , dearjuliet , why art thou yet so fair?
shall i believe that unsubstantial death is amorous , and that the lean abhorred monster keeps thee here in dark to be his paramour?
for fear of that i still will stay with thee , " and never from this palace of dim night depart again .
here .
here will i remain with worms that are thy chambermaids .
o you ...
the doors of breath , seal with a righteous kiss ... a dateless bargain to engrossing death !
here's to my love .
thus with a kiss ...
i die .
how did you get the scar?
i tried to kill myself three years ago .
i broke into the box where my mother kept the sleeping pills .
went down to the basement , into the crawl space underneath the house .
and i took them , and i went to sleep .
did you ever have something that you wanted to erase?
no .
and?
and i took too many of the damn things , and i puked them up .
then three days later my mother and brother found me and pulled me out .
and what about the scar?
i ripped my cheek on the concrete when they pulled me out .
a memento mori .
yes .
because i was dead .
only i rose up again .
like lazarus lady lazarus .
that's me .
you wouldn't do that if you knew .
what?
what was down there .
jesus christ !
what's that?
look .
very intelligent , cows .
did you know that?
really?
not a lot of people give them credit .
what do you think they'd prefer?
milton or chaucer?
chaucer .
obviously .

pleased to meet you .
we've heard a lot about you .
likewise .
how are you enjoying yourselves?
hello .
oh , we're having such a nice time .
good .
thank you .
you've made us feel so at home .
hasn't she?
if i close my eyes , i could be back in mytholmroyd .
your hem's up in the front , darling .
oh .
elizabeth , meet ted .
ted , elizabeth brooks .
how do you do?
my , aren't you the catch of the day .
ted is going to be a great poet .
his last book won what was that?
the new york center poetry prize .
it's rather good .
it's the , uh , hawk in the rain .
really wonderful .
you read it?
yes .
of course .
what did you think of the poem about the giraffe?
oh , listen to that accent .
there wasn't a poem about a giraffe .
say something else .
i need a drink .
uh , excuse me , ladies .
this sylvia's father?
mm hmm .
yes .
bumblebees were his specialty .
it's all he ever thought about .
before the war , back in germany , his colleagues always called him der bienenknig .
that means king of the bees .
yes , that's right .
that was otto .
king of the bees .
you must forgive my friends , ted .
they , uh , haven't had the advantages you have .
and what might they be?
having to fight for what you want .
that's why she's in love with you , you know .
sylvia , i mean .
oh , my god .
there were oh , there were
i don't i don't mean to sound disloyal , but there were ... a lot of other boys , but they didn't scare her .
she rather frightened them , i think .
you're
you're very different .
but i think you frightened her , and that's why she likes you .
you think i'd hurt her .
no , i wouldn't hurt her .
do you know that we found her right where you're standing?
right under there , near the boards .
we thought she was dead , she was so pale , so white .
some people want to be found .
sylvia didn't .
she just ... crawled into a hole and waited to die .
be good to her .
always .
hi .
hope you like fish .
wow , look at those .
my god .
did you have fun?
uh huh .
it finally cooled down .
it was so hot earlier , wasn't it?
you tell me .
i look a bit ... messy because i started baking , and i made
baking?
i made one real cream cake , but it went a bit funny in the center .
i just decided to throw it out and start over .
but the funny thing is , the second one looks nicer than the first one anyway .
i thought you were gonna write .
do you know , some husbands would be happy that their wives ... stayed home and baked them some nice cakes .
i am happy .
i'd just be happier if you were writing .
i've got the whole summer to write .
how was your walk?
good .
got a poem .
a good one .
you?
i'm dried up .
that's 'cause you've got nothing to say .
i'm not a real writer .
never will be .
i'm no good .
you make great cakes .
you know what your trouble is?
i have a husband who thinks he can tell me how to write poetry?
there's no secret to it .
you've just gotta pick a subject and ... stick your head into it .
you've got to write .
that's what poets do .
yes , well , that's easy for you to say .
you go out for a bike ride and come back with an epic in hexameters .
i sit down to write , i get a bake sale .
do you know what
do you know what my trouble is?
is that i don't have a subject .
the novel , falcon yard , what's that about?
it's ... about a girl who meets a boy .
no .
what's it really about?
you and me .
what's it really about?
me .
a girl who spends her summer at the beach?
no , see no , that's not really me .
yes , it is .
you told me it was about you .
what i'm trying to say is that you've already got your subject .
it's you .
and you keep skirting round the issue .
you keep flowering it up .
you keep  all right , all right , all right .
shit .
jesus christ .
what?
the tide's dragging us out .
i'm not gonna get us back in .
people drown like this .
i tried to drown myself once .
i swam out in the sea as far as i could , but it just spat me out like a cork .
i guess it didn't want me .
you know , it's funny ,
i was always happy until i was nine years old .
i was always in one piece .
then my father died .
those were pearls that were his eyes .
'destroy . !
destroy . !
destroy . ! '" hums the underconsciousness . " 'love and produce . !
love and produce . ! '" cackles the upper consciousness .
and the world hears only the 'love and produce 'cackle .
refuses to hear the hum of destruction underneath ...
until such time as it will have to hear .
the american has got to destroy !
it is his destiny .
and finally , this ... poem by yeats , i think ... illustrates ... that point rather well .
well , at least i hope it does .
excuse me .
the sorrow of love .
the quarrel of the sparrows in the eaves ,
the full round moon and the star laden sky ,
and the loud song of the ever singing leaves ,
had hid away earth's old and weary cry .
and then you came ...
with those red mournful lips ,
and with you came the whole of the world's tears ,
and all the sorrows ofher laboring ships ,
and all the burden ofher myriad years .
and now the sparrows warring in the eaves ,
the crumbling moon , the white stars in the sky ,
and the loud chanting of the unquiet leaves , are shaken with earth's old and weary cry .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you very much .
that's very kind .
take care .
i was so impressed .
bye .
yeah .
bye bye .
thank you .
mr. hughes , uh , your voice so powerful .
but , uh , what did you think of the words?
the words?
so when is your next book coming out?
well , when i've written it .
oh , it must be wonderful to be married to such a great poet .
yes , it is .
it is .
would you excuse us for just a moment?
sure .
excuse me .
i'm sorry .
i just i'm so exhausted , and i've got a stack of papers this high to get through .
do you mind if we go now or in a minute?
i'm gonna have to say thanks to merwin for that review .
and len baskin's here , so i who's len baskin?
len baskin .
he organized all this .
oh , right .
right .
so look , take the car .
all right .
i'll see you later .
right .
is mr. hughes in?
no .
he said he'd look at my poetry .
he said it would be okay .
i'm sorry if i disturbed you .
yeah .
who is she?
she's nobody .
a student .
she was ... in that creative writing class i i talked to .
she'd written all these poems .
i took pity on her .
you think i'm fucking her .
are you?
oh , for christ's sake !
this place is really getting to you , isn't it?
this bunch of dried up , malicious old women ... who think their men are gonna get a taste for fresh meat .
as a matter of fact , i'm not fucking her .
but if i do start fucking the students , you'll be the first to know .
last night i
i was very tired .
i
i've organized everything so i won't i won't be quite so tired , um
i'm sorry .
it's not just you .
it's me as well .
i can't write here .
we should go back to england .
and live on what?
we'll survive , lovely .
do you see that?
that's the world .
page 1 4 , on line line 1 4 .
yes .
page 1 4 , line 1 4 .
there is an " e " yes .
no , two .
two " p " 's .
will you get that?
uh , page 40 .
yes .
next line eight .
next the new moon's curve .
oh , those guys are all the same .
i mean , i wouldn't have thought right .
right .
i mean , after hawk in the rain , they , uh
no . the literary establishment were all hoping your next book would be an ... anticlimax .
but i'm pleased to say you've confounded them and outdone yourself .
it's really quite wonderful .
on the back page .
in the back jacket .
uh , i've just made some coffee .
would you like a cup?
well , i think you can speak to the agent about that .
all right?
hello .
hello .
you must be mr. alvarez .
yes , indeed .
and you must be mrs. hughes?
night shift "?
uh
night shift . " it's a poem you printed in the observer .
oh , yes .
night shift . " yes .
it was a good poem .
well , yes , i know .
i wrote it .
oh , you're sylvia plath .
i am .
oh .
nice to meet you .
and you .
uh , tell me , have you written any others or yes , i have .
actually , i have a , uh , book of poems coming out very shortly called the colossus .
i'd love to read them .
thank you .
it would be an honor .
i spoke to george about it last week and , uh , he was quite optimistic .
it might take another six months .
the whole thing , it's about putting a face to a name .
for them to put , you know , your name to duh , duh , duh , and likewise .
i mean , we've got charlie hetheringham here from the t. l. s.
there's robinson from the critical quarterly .
that one there?
yeah .
and , um , there's , uh , the telegraph there and the times .
and , uh oh, yes, you see that chap with the big ears?
he's easy .
he's from the listener .
so , it's a good turnout, you know .
that's a good sign , isn't it , that they all came?
well , yes , of course .
i mean , don't get your hopes up too high , but , yes it is .
it really is .
they're all bloody civil servants moonlighting as journalists .
it's their job to protect the status quo .
that's the toughest .
mr. robinson .
mr. robinson .
you forgot this .
oh , uh , thanks .
do you think you might be reviewing it?
this?
i shouldn't think so .
we just got the new pasternak .
then betjeman's out next week , and there's an e . e . cummings in the pipeline .
not in the same league , really , is she , this sylvia
plath .
poor thing .
can't be easy for her , being married to that .
still , good party .
thank the boss .
this is good .
what?
by alvarez .
very good .
listen .
her poems rest secure in a mass of experience ... that is never quite brought out into daylight .
then there's a quote , and it says ,
it is this sense of threat , as though she were continually menaced ...
by something she could see only out of the corner of her eye ... that gives her work its distinction .
what about the rest?
it's a good review .
one review?
but it's a good review .
look , it's hard .
you know it's gonna be hard .
my first book won prizes .
i'll get it .
hello .
no , no .
no , no .
no problem .
yes .
yeah .
oh , no , certainly .
certainly .
um
yes .
no , no .
that's no problem .
i'll

all right .

thank you .
excuse me .
do you mind telling me what's going on?
i see you .
you see what?
why do you insist on humiliating me?
sylvia , nobody's humiliating you .
i mean , why bother?
you do such a bloody good job of it yourself .
can i give you a top up?
please .
oh , my god .
look at this .
well, you shouldn't have gone to all this trouble .
i'm beginning to think the same thing myself .
oh, jesus christ .

that's enough for me .
thank you .
thank you .
you're not eating .

i shall be very insulted if you don't eat .
would you like some?
no , you help yourself .
thanks .
so , are you managing to write at all , with the baby?
me?
oh , no .
no .
but ted is .
and that's really all that matters , isn't it?
i mean , he's the real poet in the house .
the sea was still breaking violently and night had steamed ... into our north atlantic fleet when the drowned sailor clutched the dragnet .
light flashed from his matted head and marble feet .
he grappled at the net with the coiled , hurdling muscles of his thighs .
the corpse was bloodless a botch of reds and whites
i'm gonna do the washing up .
i'll help .
no , i'm fine .
no , i insist .
... on a stranded hulk heavy with sand .
i'll wash , you dry .
yes . ... and heave it seaward whence it came ... where the heel headed dogfish barks ... its nose on ahab's void and forehead ... and the name is blocked in yellow chalk .
what is going on?
nothing's going on .
assia was just telling me about a dream she'd had .
can i help with anything?
i'd like you and assia to leave first thing in the morning .
it's just that i'm tired .
i'm so tired , and i
you don't know what i've been through .
i've got two small children .
if you had children of your own , you would understand .
i'm sorry .
of course .
when will you be back?
i don't know .
a couple of days , maybe three .
depends how long it takes .
what number will you be at?
i haven't decided who i'm gonna stay with yet .
i think people are getting pretty sick of me sleeping on their floors .
so , i'll probably just check into a bed and breakfast .
you don't have to go , you know .
yes , i do .
sylvia?
the truth comes to me .
the truth loves me .
hello?
i know who you are .
hello .
get out .
this is the light of the mind .
if the moon smiled , she would resemble you .
their redness talks to my wound .
she would drag me , cruelly , being barren .
thick , red and slipping
your nakedness shadows our safety .
whose is that long white box on the grove?
they can die , i need feed them nothing .
i sizzled in his blue
our cheesecloth gauntlets neat and sweet
bare handed i hand the combs .
the man in white smiles
so i can't see what is in there .
some god got hold of me
lightly , through their white swaddlings , like an awful baby
a world of bald white days in a shadeless socket .
i cannot undo myself , and the train is steaming
the upflight of the murderess
and the villagers never liked you .
they are dancing and stamping on you .
they always knew it was you .
daddy , daddy , you bastard , i'm through .
it's , uh
it's what?
what is it?
is it any good?
good?
oh , god , yes .
that " daddy " poem , the use of metaphor , the way it builds at the end ... out of the blackness into an explosion of fury , it's just stunning .
i'm thinking of moving back to london .
i'll send you some more as soon as i'm settled .
i'd like that .
sylvia .
i know this must have been hard on you .
no .
really , i've never been happier .
and i've never written more .
it's as if ... now he's gone , i'm free .
i can finally write .
i wake up between 3 : 00 and 4 : 00 , 'cause that's the worst time , and i write till dawn .
i really feel like god is speaking through me .
and now we need the little purple star .
go up here .
put all of them on .
we've got the snowflake .
all right .
where's he gonna live?
mm , there .
she looks beautiful .
hello?
hello?
all right .
i'm very sorry to bother you .
i'm i'm i'm
i live upstairs and my lights have gone out .
i've got no hot water .
i've got my children up there and i'm there's been a power cut .
the moment you need heat and light to sustain life itself , the government cuts the electricity .
why?
to build the national character .
now , leave your stove on for heat and to boil water for washing .
here's some spare candles , yeah , and some and some matches .
there you are .
thank you .
you must think i'm some stupid american bitch .
oh , no , not at all .
i assumed you were canadian .
yes .
well , thank you .
pleasure .
thank you very much .
bye bye .
hello , sweetheart .
this one's for you .
happy christmas , darling .
i didn't just come to see them .
i wanted to see you .
wanted to see how you are .
i've missed you .
i've missed you all .
christmas is bloody hard .
can we can we talk?
can we sit down?
are you still fucking her?
i have fallen a long way .
the moon sees nothing of this .
and the message of the yew tree is blackness blackness and silence .
i don't know what else to do .
i can't
i can't go back to her , but i love her so much it's
do you want another one?
mm .
thank you .
this one is extraordinary .
and , uh , " lady lazarus , " the one about the , uh the failed suicides the despair , the overpowering sense of foreboding , and yet without a trace ... of anger or hysteria ... or any appeal for sympathy .
the the wealth of imagery .
such horrors , but expressed with , um with a coolness ,
like a like a murderer's confession .
so [ clears throat ]
have you got a title for your novel yet?
the bell jar .
when's it coming out?
the new year .
are you gonna let me read it?
it's a potboiler .
could you get me an ashtray?
sure .
i didn't know you smoked .
i don't .
but i'm starting .
i'm thinking of trying some new things .
really?
like what?
i'm thinking of taking a lover .
oh , how glamorous .
who is he?
look , i know how you feel .
no , you don't .
i do .
we have we share in common a
i
i tried to i tried to
how?
uh , same as you .
sleeping pills .
i , uh i took too many .
everybody does , don't they?
sometimes i feel like i'm not ... solid .
i'm hollow .
there's ... nothing behind my eyes .
i'm a negative of a person .
it's as if i never
i never thought anything .
i never wrote ... anything , i never felt anything .
all i want is blackness blackness and silence .
look , one thing i do know about death ... is it is not a a reunion or a homecoming .
there's there's no
your life doesn't flash before you and the missing piece of you clicks into place .
it's just there's just fuck all .
there's nothing .
so what do you do when your life ... gets as bad as it can ... and just keeps getting worse?
you just keep going .
look .
listen .
you are so beautiful .
and you've you've a wonderful mind .
and you are a great a great poet .
and you and ted , you understand each other in ways that that other people can only dream about .
so , for god's sakes , don't throw it all away just because
i don't want to hear her name .
i was gonna say just because of an affair .
are you all right?
come in .
sit here .
i'm gonna die .
i'm gonna die soon .
who's gonna take care of my babies?
mrs. hughes , i don't understand .
what do you mean , you're going to die?
are you ill?
have you been ill or
no , i'm not ill .
i think i really should call the doctor .
no , no , don't call a doctor .
don't you know what they do?
they hook you up to the eastern grid and fill you full of sparks .
yeah .
i'm sorry .
no , i'm sorry .
i'm just so on edge , i
i'm just so on edge , i
oh , god , it's all my fault , it's all my fault , it's all my fault .
all i could think about is what would happen if ... somebody took him away from me .
you see , if you fear something enough , you can make it happen .
that woman ,
i conjured her .
i invented her .
do you understand?
no , i'm sorry .
i don't .
it's just that i'm so tired , i'm so tired , i'm
if i could just sleep a little bit , just a little bit
i'm just so exhausted .
perhaps we could get someone to look after your children .
oh , my god !
i left them upstairs !
no , don't go .
i'll go and check , see if they're all right .
would you like me to do that?
you stay there .
you're a very nice man .
mm , no .
you remind me a little of my father .
yes , hello , kate .
it's sylvia .
i'm all right .
i'm
i was wondering if i could come round and see you .
i see .
okay .
dr. hawkins , it's sylvia .
i [ sobs ]
i need help .
i
you look ... very nice .
you'd better come in .
would you like a drink?
please .
what do you want , sylvia?
i wanted to see you .
i thought that you ... might like to see us .
i thought there was something wrong .
alvarez said you tried to make a pass at him .
and i've been told you've been taking pills .
no .
god , i missed you .
i almost went mad .
we're not even two people .
even before we met , we were just ... these two halves ... walking around with big ... gaping holes in us shaped like the other person .
and then we found each other and we were finally a whole .
but then it's as if we couldn't stand being happy , so we ripped we ripped ourselves in half again .
in the spring , we should go back to devon .
we'll go back to devon and it'll just be us ... and the children and our work .
it'll be like this whole thing never happened .
and the summer and the fall and this awful winter it'll all fade by the time the leaves come out .
and it'll just seem like some nightmare that was never real .
you don't love her like you love me .
you'll never have with her what you have with me .
you know that .
i know .
leave her .
i can't .
she's pregnant .
oh .
everything all right?
do you have any stamps?
it's silly , i know , but i've got , uh
i've gotta post some letters to america tonight and i airmail , and i don't have any stamps .
well , can't you post them in the morning?
no .
no , i've got i've got a nurse coming in the morning .
you see , there's a nurse coming .
and , anyway , i won't be here in the morning .
oh , i see .
yes , i think i've got some .
here we are .
thank you .
stamps .
thanks .
thank you .
well , good night .
good night .
look , do you want me to call someone?
no .
no , i was just having
i just had the most beautiful ... dream .
i love you , sweetheart .
the box is locked .
it is dangerous .
there are no windows , so i can't see what is in there .
there is only a little grid .
no exit .
