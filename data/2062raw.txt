hey , scotty .

scotty , can you get the front door?
and don't drop those eggs .
your father needs them for experiments .

calm down , buddy .
it's just me .

calm down , buddy .
it's just me .

my beautiful pie .
bad dog !
get out , get out , get out !
out , you animal !
control here .
we've got a serious problem .
my god .
get the best doggone agent you can in there .
go !
gentlemen , a few moments ago i received word of the gravest nature .
the key agent working the brody case has been catnapped .
although he is safe , we must replace him as soon as possible .
it appears that once again we find ourselves threatened ... ... by the great cat menace .
we suspect that a rogue feline is involved in a conspiracy ... ... to destroy all we dogs have worked so hard to achieve .
therefore , in accordance with plan delta ... ... we have assembled an elite team of agents ... ... trained to replace our catnapped comrade .
at this moment , replacements are flying in from london .
one will take his place as the brodys 'pet ... ... and guard their home from cat invasion .
i need not remind you that the future of man and dog alike ... ... depends on the success of this mission .
failure is not an option .
the stakes are high .
we have everything to lose .
one hundred million dogs have placed their destiny ... ... squarely in our paws .
i'll bite your ear .
get off me !
that's my eye you're poking .
coming through !
pardon me .
step aside .
coming through .
out of the way .
clear the area .
not again .
what is it this time?
i don't think this is a good idea .
i can't believe this guy .
when i pull this rope . . .
what is he doing? . . . the sack will fall on the pitchfork and send me out the window . . . . . . and on the way to freedom , so step back .
what is it with you?
me?
what's with you?
i want adventure .
not wait for someone to take me to some boring house .
what's wrong with a family that loves you?
free food , a warm place to sleep .
and you could go to the bathroom wherever you want .
don't you want to do something exciting?
like be a police dog !
no?
or a russian space dog !
or sample the great bones of europe !
come on , guys .
oh , forget it .
see you puppies later .
oh , boy , i can't watch .
this ought to be good .

i'm sorry , hon .
i know that it's been a month .
but remember how happy we were when we found buddy?
i bet he's making a new family just as happy right now .

i wouldn't do that if i were you .
i like your spirit , but do me a favor and stand back .
that's my biscuit .
that would've been the shortest assignment in history .
where you going?
i guess hq ain't training the way they used to .
who exactly are you?
name's butch .
what stupid name did the bipeds saddle you with?
spot?
fifi?
rover?
lou .
god forbid .
oh , lou .
sorry .
is that boy always so grumpy?
maybe they should switch his food .
humans can get a little emotional .
you'll get used to it .
come on .
where's that coming from?
cool .
what?
it's standard equipment .
ec three vid phone , research archive database , cipher charts , snausages .
hey , what's this?
heel !
that's the big button .
you don't just press the big button .
jeez .
sorry .
just try to remember your training .
let's get started .
your new master's a scientist .
he's been working on a cure for dog allergies .
it's a big deal .
if no one's allergic to dogs , we'll have the advantage .
agent 1 364 , alka buddy .
he was catnapped about a month ago .
wasn't on top of his game .
he had to retire .
he got a nice condo in boca .
lucky dog .
you're here to replace him .
and to keep the cats away from the formula .
can't let them near that .
now , come on .
all right , agent , let's meet the team .
agent " !
whoa !
kid , look over there .
that's peek .
peek?
i don't get it .
peek , show yourself .
we got a calico on the corner of center and main ....
oh , my god !
peek's early warning .
he's got it all .
radar , sonar , thermo imaging , odor matrixing .
he can detect a non residential cat from three blocks away .
peek , fall in .
roger that .
sam , what's your 20?
one eighteenth of a klick east .
i'm going to backtrack using a delta approach in three ... . . . two . . . one .
oh , no , not again .
where am i?
over here , sam .
request permission to pant heavily , sir .
granted .
boys , i want you to meet lou .
hey , louie .
hey , lou .
human !
lou's taking over for buddy .
he's in the hot seat .
fresh from the academy , he's up to date on the latest techniques .
aren't you , lou?
you know this one?
here we come .
i got you !
oh , i just missed you .
holy chihuahua .
how did this happen?
he accidentally slipped through .
he's still got his you know whats !
there's no time , butch .
the puppy stays .
end of discussion .
out .
so tell me , one of you . . . . . . is the dog out of the way?
did the puppy fall for my clever trap?
none of you have a tale to tell?
a little story for me , perhaps?
you !
tell me , is the game afoot?
yes?
why is the game afoot?
i mean , no .
ah , excellent .
so the puppy is dead .
now we can move on to
wait , wait .
can i change my answer?
is the puppy alive or not?
another dog told him it was a bomb .
another dog?
anyway , i am sure we'll get into the basement lab just fine .
right , guys?
guys !
oh , yeah , sure , no problem .
absolutely .
see?
project dark cloud should go down without a hitch .
dark cloud?
is that what i'm calling my plan?
not that i know of .
no , you're calling it . . . .
how about storm !
dark storm .
dark storm , yes .
yes .
like a powerful , dark storm . . . . . . i will make my presence known to the world .
. . . and make them quake in fear at the very mention of my name !
mr. tinkles !
hide !
quickly !
where are you?
hide !
there you are , mr. tinkles .
i've been looking everywhere for you .
where have you been?
mr. mason will be so pleased to see you .
i'll take you to him .
you're a stinky kitty .
first you have to have a bath .
mr. tinkles , don't forget to wash behind the ears !
if i'm going to be a secret agent , i should have a better name .
he's a pro wrestler .
that name's taken .
then " doom machine " it is .
you can call yourself squicky the space dog for all i care .
that don't make your behind a rocket pack .
you are not an agent , but you are going to help us .
so first things first .
kid , pay attention .
dogs have always been man's best friend .
i'm sure even you know that .
but cats , they're another story .
peek , start with ancient egypt .
we've seen that 5 billion times .
okay .
never mind .
sorry .
here goes .
ancient egypt .
see these hieroglyphics?
humans read them and say that ancient people worshiped cats .
an evil cat named shen akh akumon made them build pyramids , monuments . . . . . . and treated them like they were his litter box .
things were terrible .
this is the best part .
so the dogs , being man's best friend , rose up .
and put them down .
with humans being back on top , we took our natural place at their side .
and the people just forgot?
remember , they're a very primitive species .
can't sense earthquakes , smell fear .
heck , they can't even take responsibility for their own farts .
gross .
guilty .
i'll get the fence .
that's how our outfit got started .
sometimes a rogue cat gets too big for his coat and thinks he can take over .
our mission's to keep the cats from the lab until he finishes the formula .
anything weird , call us on the collar .
yes , sir !
any questions?
just one , sir .
shoot .
what's ancient egypt?
freeze , cat .
i'm an agent .
i'm so fast , i can't see myself .
agent doom machine .
that's right .
watch out , cat .
i couldn't even see it .
there's a good puppy .
hello !
don't get scared .
don't get scared .
look how good you're being .
look how good .
where's that?
there .
i got it .
this won't hurt a bit .
let's see .
let's see .
hey , that's good .
hey , dad !
boils .
want to help me practice?
no .
no .
i forgot your bow .
oh , your pretty bow .
when i rule the earth , you will be the first . . . . . . on my list .
keep your hair like that .
it's slimming .
there's room on that list for you .
no , i mean it .
we only have a few days to succeed .
although playing pet for that sick old man upstairs is key to my scheme . . . . . . i cannot stand this humiliation any longer .
am i clear?
never mind .
the puppy won't survive the night .
send in the ninjas .
nervous about the tryouts tomorrow?
no .
it's okay to be nervous .
i'm not nervous .
i stink , but i'm not nervous .
is he saying that because he needs me to reassure him?
yes .
reassure him .
you're the most wonderful , great , charming , good looking . . .
. . . boy in the whole wide world .
maybe your dad could help you .
no , i'm pretty sure he stinks too .
i'm going to talk to him .
time for bed .
turn off the tv .
five minutes .

love you .
i love you too .

you're still standing .

my orders are clear .
i can't  orders?
yep .
i'm a secret agent .

you're small for an agent .
shouldn't you be having fun?
i don't have time .
tough guy .

okay?
you have your own kid to play with .
don't take it for granted .

you never complained when your belly was scratched .
