that's how it always ends .
a bit of magic , a bit of smoke .
something floating .
but it doesn't work without the necessary push .
a bit of laughter , a man ... a beautiful woman , and love .
let's start over .
at the beginning , it was a man alone .
no , he's not alone .
yet .
that's the first step .
the man .
laughter comes next .
woman .
love .
look at him .
we can start like that , although this ain't how it starts .
that's why you must be quiet .
it's important , you must believe me .
the man goes into a bar .
he sees the beautiful woman .
do they know each other?
they don't seem to know each other , but ... it's like they recognize one another .
who knows who?
is that the beginning or the end?
this is what we're about to see .
it's the beginning and the end .
love and goodbye .
i know i don't need to mention it , but i'm doing it .
remember , everything is just a movie .
a creation .
it hurts , anyway .
hi .
hi .
hi .
will you come?
yes , to rome .
the plane leaves soon .
we must hurry .
what are you going to do?
i don't have much time .
alex .
aimee .
aimee?
yeah .
like that french girl?
yes , you know her?
maybe we should go to paris?
i don't think so .
maybe we should wait a little .
yes , i agree .
may i get you something?
i cup of coffee , please .
aren't you hungry?
anything else?
two coffees please .
excuse me , what exactly is it that you want?
i just want to go to rome .
i guess ...
thanks .
i guess it's still early .
we must get to know each other a bit better .
yes , i agree .
i just know that you are too beautiful .
thanks .
if i'm allowed to say that .
yes , you're allowed .
that's all you know?
all i know is that if you're my dream , then i am yours .
what do you want?
i wanna say goodbye .
you wanna say goodbye?
now?
no .
first i must come inside .
then , i must sit in a table , or in the bar somewhere .
it doesn't matter .
i'm with a beautiful woman .
i order something to drink ...
i cup of coffee maybe .
i drink it .
i look her in the eyes .
then , i tell her that i love her .
she looks back at me and laughs .
she doesn't know me , that's for sure , but i remind her of something .
almost ...
that's not how i was supposed to leave .
well , i suppose i should .
she looks at me .
she waits .
the night keeps going .
she realizes that i'm not lying .
i really love her .
and that's it .
that exact moment is the moment when i say " goodbye " .
the time has come .
let's start over .
it's not that complicated .
there are four people .
there's aimee and me , august .
we're married .
there's also alex , the photographer , and his girlfriend , simon .
they're not married .
alex and aimee will get to know each other .
not yet , soon enough .
all of them are looking for love ...
poor kids ...
it will be a great battle .
may the battle begin .
alme at the hllton
it's very nice , isn't it?
very nice .
it's from monica .
she wants to go down for a drink .
are you listening to me?
yes , she wants us down for a drink .
now?
yes .
you want to?
i'm tired .
i wanted to chat a bit with you .
i'll go , and you'll miss me tonight .
but you have monica .
yes , but just for one drink .
i'll paint .
you go .
are you sure?
yes .
listen ...
i thought my whole life story .
i know how they're gonna meet each other .
i'll tell you tomorrow .
you sure you ain't coming?
i love you .
me too .
won't you take your suitcase?
no , i have everything i need here .
we'll talk again tomorrow .
how are things going?
what?
at home .
in your life , love ...
ain't that what we usually ask?
everything is fine .
you?
fine also .
that's good .
yes , quite good .
what would make you really happy?
really happy?
yes , almost complete .
i don't know , but even if i knew , i wouldn't do it either .
would you do it against all odds?
yes , i would .
i dreamed i was with someone else , not simon .
she was nothing special .
she wasn't so beautiful .
she had nice skin and small tits .
but she was ... so delicate , that was almost silly .
and for some strange reason , i became to be afraid ... that i may hurt her .
i woke up that morning in such a panic .
have i really hurt her?
honestly .
i was totally ...
i don't know ...
i was never so afraid of hurting someone .
i felt more responsible for her , than for simon .
take care , ok?
take care .
you too .
kisses to nan .
and simon .
will you be angry?
for what?
if i leave .
i know dad wants to go for a drink , but i don't want to .
yes , i'm leaving .
excuse me .
i hope he doesn't get pissed with me .
and excuse you by saying what?
that my deadline is coming .
your deadline?
yes , something like that .
stay a bit more .
you never see him .
i don't want to .
he wants to be with you .
i don't think so .
of course he does .
i'm not in the mood .
what would you say about us , then?
is there a chance we go out sometime?
yes , of course .
really?
i'll wait for you at the station .
we'll go for a drink , all right?
see you at the station , then .
my love ...
you're drowning me .
you're holding me too tight .
quickly , before he's here .
yes , all right , see you later .
nice restaurant .
that's very kind of you .
can we go now?
where is alex?
alex had to go .
he apologizes .
is that how he always leaves?
no .
you know how dedicated he is at what he's doing .
what do you have to say about that?
alex is ... sweet .
sweet?
do you love him?
yeah .
does he love you?
do you love me?
yeah .
why you never say it?
i say it .
yes , only when i ask .
never by yourself .
i love you .
yes .
bye , simon .
it was good , while it lasted .
indeed .
alex alme underground statlon
are you all right?
how did it go with my father?
you're an idiot , you know that?
i'm out for a newspaper .

no .
did you find your newspaper?
no .
i love you .
i hope you know that .
i must go .

to rome .
the plane leaves in a few minutes .
to rome?
yes .
no , i'm sorry .
what do you want?
what?
what will you order?
a coffee , please .
just coffee?
aren't you hungry?
no .
make them two , please .
thanks .
why rome , specifically?
i think it's the right place .
don't you agree?
you are very beautiful , if i'm allowed to say so .
you're allowed .
alex .
aimee .
thanks .
who are you?
what?
who are you?
you forgot me already?
what?
you forgot me already?
forget you?
of course not .
you sure?
yeah , sure .
it's you and ...
yes , so you remember me , after all .
you're late , though .
five minutes late .
we were supposed to meet at 11 , right?
i had no idea it was so late .
i'm sorry .
it doesn't matter , as long as you're here .
you won't leave though , right?
i won't go anywhere .
did you bring your photos with you?
no .
you forgot about them too?
what exactly have you remembered?
i've got some here .
you see?
nice .
what is it?
a woman with three choices .
either stay where she is , jump into the future , or ...
or?
she knows the rest .
only she .
how does this look?
we'll see .
you haven't decided yet?
not yet .
i need some more time .
of course i would be allowed .
time for thought .
it's a critical decision , anyway .
yes , indeed .
i trust no photographer .
i must be very careful with'em .
can i trust you?
of course .
you swear?
why me?
because , if i am your dream ...
you are mine .
aimee stands besides the door .
chapter 1 ... something floating ...

alex at hls home
good morning .
i'm sorry ms. banum .

they look heavy ...
no , as you can see by yourself , i'm managing just fine .
who is it?
alex .
who?
alex , from upstairs .
sorry , i can't hear you .
the door is sound proof .
who you said you are?
i am alex .
i just wanted to say that i can't get inside .
inside the apartment .
what's wrong?
are they doing any repair stuff?
repair stuff?
what do you mean?
i cannot enter my apartment .
there is no door .
maybe it's my fault , but i don't have a clue about what you're talking .
it's difficult to understand it myself .
there is no door up there .
what do you mean " up there "?
in my apartment .
which apartment?
ms. banum , i live right above your house .
in the attic?
who gave permission to do such a thing?
excuse me , did simon told you to do this?
why?
simon , my girlfriend .
for christ sake .
i must go .
i see you have guests .
goodbye .
only that ...
we may have to leave today .
i'm not so well .
i'm not in the mood for any more lectures .
i'll probably cancel them all .
really?
is that possible?
of course it's possible .
i thought it was important .
it is , but i don't wanna stuck here forever .
don't you wanna leave with me?
let's just stay alone , have a little chat .
you really mean that?
yes , i do .
and why's that , all of a sudden?

i'll take my stuff by monday , so i can enter my home again .

you have 2 brothers , khale and ghorme .
how do you know all these things?
cause you told'em to me .
listen , we love each other ...
i'm sorry , i have to go .
bye .
hello?
hi , it's me .
get up !
what happened?
i am your son !
my name is alex david .
i had a very strange day .
that's why ...
i need you .
you understand me , of course .
you're my father .
you are crazy .
dad , listen to me !
whatever happens , i love you .
what's all this bullshit?
go away !
i mean it !
may i help you , sir?
a table for two , please .
of course , this way please .
thanks .
and the bathroom?
that way .
that door .
nothing's wrong , alex .
nothing .
everything will go just fine .
you'll go out , and she'll be waiting for you there .
so , you finally made it .
i'm very happy .
wonderful ...
is there something wrong?
no , everything is fine .
we got a table over there .
all right .
i'm sorry .
thank you .
are you ready?
here we go .
how many more interviews?
not that many .
only 3 .
good .
is there something wrong?
no , on the contrary .
i'm sorry to be asking this , but is she related with alex?
i haven't seen her at all .
no , she moved to the city .
she came only to see me .
i suppose she doesn't have the time of her life , but ...
nothing .
let's go .
i'm going outside to have a look .
excuse me .
can you ask that gentleman if i can sit with him?
of course .
excuse me .
that lady asks if she can sit with you .
that one?
she's welcome .
i'll tell her so .
you are welcome to join him .
may i?
please do .
my name is aimee .
alex .
you seemed so nice , and i thought you might need some company .
of course .
are you hungry?
yes , i haven't eaten a proper lunch .
nice lighter .
i have it always with me .
you come here often?
no , i wouldn't say so .
so , no one knows you here?
no .
what's your point?
i was just wondering about this place .
if you come here often .
what would you prefer?
i don't know .
either we sit here ... and watch the menu , even if it's not needed , 'cause we already know what we want ...
we order , they bring us the food , nice dices , as always ...
we chat a bit , we listen ... maybe not .
we're not bored , but we feel comfortable with one another .
either this , or ...
or?
we look at the menu , we ask the waiter to explain it to us ...
we look at each other ...
who are you really?
i wanna know .
i don't really know anything , and i want to know all .
what would you prefer?
can't i take both?
maybe ...
why are you so passionate about love?
i don't think i am .
your writings are notorious .
it's because i'm interested in that subject .
men do experience love in a different way , than women do .
i love talking it generally .
i believe that love , basically ... has a different meaning for each one of the two sexes .
for the woman kind , love is necessary .
can't live without it .
for her , love is a very conscious choice of life .
she chooses to love .
so , love can be someone's choice?
yes , ain't that true?
romance doesn't destroy that choice .
from the other hand , us , men kind , we want it to happen suddenly .
without any programming .
because we feel shame of that .
it's an obstacle .
even as a target , or as a means , love is necessary .
and that's the right thing .
were you obliged to marry your wife?
or chose to?
what was that?
we left without paying .
without paying?
didn't you pay?
no .
no?
no !
no?
you didn't do that .
oh , yes .
you're a beautiful crook .
how would you react if i told you i'm falling in love with you?
is that true?
would you consider it a bit " too much "?
no .
what are you doing?
i'm giving you my ring .
why?
so we meet again .
what do you mean?
when i'm gone ...
gone? ...
i'll be back .
where?
here .
here?
yes , this was the place , wasn't it?
yes , this was it .
tonight , maybe?
in a few hours , you mean?
yes , see you later ...
will we do it then?
now?
yes , now .
first , i must say goodbye to someone .
leave a note at the hotel about our meeting time .
so , we go?
yes , i'll say goodbye now .
you should do the same .
in rome , i want you all for myself .
don't you worry .
alex ...
i don't know who you are .
neither do i , basically .
will you ever remember me?
are you sure?
i know .
august , i wanna talk to you .
can we sit down for a moment?
before you say anything , let me show you something .
my love , not now ...
maybe , what you're about to say ...
i only wanna show you ...
aimee ...
i know i'm not an easy going person .
not now , august .
listen to me .
you must listen to me .
i don't say often that i love you ... and that you are necessary for me .
i know you're feeling neglected , but i'm not neglecting you .
it's because i'm such a difficult person , i want you to see this .
for aimee
without her i would be nothing " .
i really mean that , you know .
aimee , forgive me for being so stupid , but i love you .
i want the two of us to go away .
i've already spoken to monica .
i'll do my last lecture tonight , and then we're off .
we'll go whenever you want .
whenever you like .
it's your choice .
i can't ...
i'm sorry .
can you please connect me to aimee holme at room 1235 , please?
thanks .
may i leave a message?
meet me at the cafe about 8 " .
write down that i have done the reservation .
no , write down that i have the tickets .
thank you .
bye .
i love you
i hope you know that
don't you understand?
that we've always loved you?
always ...
almee at the hllton
one moment .
i'm very happy to see you .
what do you want?
have seen august anywhere?
no .
isn't he having a dinner with you?
won't you come too?
no , i can't make it .
are you sure you don't know where he is?
see you later , aimee .
yeah .
you look nice .
thanks .
see you .
can you talk to me?
is something wrong between you and august?
no , everything is fine .
you ain't leaving him , right?
i know he would never get over something like that .
i must go , monica .
bye .
alex boble bar
hi , handsome .
are you following me?
no , i ...
i just came here to see you .
why?
i came to say " goodbye " .
you should say " hello " first .
come in .
i can't , i'm not alone .
i'm with you .
come .
no , i just came to say " goodbye " .
goodbye ...
there are no words when i'm with you " .
goodbye " .
excuse me .
have you seen someone around 30 , tall , with black hair?
unfortunately no .
ok , thanks .
amy krashnapolski alex boble bar
i really must go now .
stay just a little more .
don't you remember me at all?
no .
where are you , alex?
come .
i must call somewhere .
say something beautiful .
you are adorable .
i must call somewhere .
excuse me , may i have some change to make a phone call?
what's the problem with the phone?
must be broken .
i must go .
no !
yes , i'm sorry .
are you leaving me?
yes .
goodbye , simon .
will you kiss me?
a goodbye kiss .
a unique moment .
krashnapolski here ...
can you see a woman with blond hair in the cafe?
she's from sweden , around 25 years old ...
no , sir , we're full .
it's important .
look around .
i'm sorry , sir , i have no time .
it's simple .
blonde and beautiful .
her name is aimee , she speaks swedish .
it's impossible not to notice her .
man , i don't see her right now .
it's crowded .
call later if you want .
did you see a blonde woman here somewhere?
she speaks swedish .
she came and go?
my love ...
you never came .
i'm sorry .
i'll do anything to make it up to you again .
you never came .
no ... no .
i was confused .
i had to reconsider the whole situation first .
alex hesitated at a very critical point .
he loses aimee .
the last person that was left for him .
the only one .
can their love survive?
what will it take?
a test .
for him and for her .
his love for her .
stupid?
maybe .
if he steps back ... if he doubts ... she will disappear .
not now .
monica is at the reception .
how are you?
what are you doing here?
i don't understand it .
our plane is leaving .
in one hour we're leaving .
who?
me and my husband .
why are you playing?
what kind of game is this?
my husband is waiting for me .
knock it off .
aimee , you know me .
i know for sure .
look at me .
we love each other .
let's take another flight .
let's leave tomorrow .
we can still leave ...
knock it off !
you know who i am .
i'm sorry , i'm expected .
i love you ...
we must go now .
i'll talk to them .
what happened there?
some young man , nothing .
he thought he knew you?
he thought he loved me .
lovely .
was he irritating?
no , not at all .
time is pressing us , you know .
goodbye , aimee ...
the woman left .
the laughter stopped .
but the man is still here .
not like that ...
all alone .
look at him ...
it's all just a movie .
a creation .
anyway , it hurts .
the end
