robert , i'm home !
sweetie ... where are you?
i made the delivery for the saenz lady .
i got soaked .
all for nothing .
she didn't pay .
she told me her husband has also been fired .
he's useless .
she says she'll manage to pay me next week .
roca didn't pay either .
she made me show her three different creams and then she tried all the mascaras and rouge .
when i left , she was made up like a clown and she didn't even buy a little brush .
we have so many shampoos and little soaps .
i don't know who's gonna buy them .
i spent the whole day working and i got no orders .
have you eaten?
you're staining the spread .
come on !
come to bed !
come to bed !
i don't like it when you smell of wine .
honestly , sandra , you can do better .
tonight you only opened your mouth to say " i'm sleepy " .
you could've been nicer to the mexican guy .
and you didn't have to be so friendly to his wife .
she's not his wife .
she's a girl i got him .
i'm working for you .
i always work for you .
you're always on my mind .
are you jealous?
i'm negotiating a deal with telemundo for a 300 episode soap opera and you can't stand the guy who's gonna pay 1 million dollars so that you can do what you want .
you know what that means?
yes , i know .
the slobbering star will go on slicking his tongue in my mouth in every love scene .
who the hell asked you to do anything?
don't fuck with me .
do you know what it means to get into the latino market?
it's the most important production company in la .
they want to make a movie with you as a star .
you instead of sandra bullock .
ever heard of her?
well , they prefer a latin american actress .
did you imagine this when you lived in villa adela?
and they wanna sell a doll with your face and your own perfume .
i'll tell you who's working in the film they want to make .
my dad was the director of the william shakespeare
theater company in arroyo seco .
he loved classics .
he named my eldest brother mark anthony , the other brother
romeo , and me , cleopatra .
my younger sister was going to be
electra , but she was dead when she born .
i know i have to live up to my name and i could be disappointed , but i'm not .
i still hope to be able to do wonderful things .
and learn more than i do now .
my dad used to say that i would be a good actress .
i wanted to be an actress , to be somebody else .
but i was already roberto's girlfriend and he didn't let me .
so i became a teacher .
which is similar in a way .
you say something and other people listen to you .
my daugher , nancy , got married , lives in the us and has two kids .
and my son robertito , who lives in spain and sells handicraft on the beach .
he made this .
i've been married for 37 years .
2 and a half years ago roberto was fired from the factory the same month i retired .
he didn't expect that .
at first he looked for a job .
with roberto's severance pay we opened a grocery store .
but soon a supermarket opened opposite our store .
with the little money we still had , we bought a taxi which was stolen before we could insure it .
since i retired i worked as a private teacher ,
i sewed , i made home made cakes , flower arrangements .
i'm selling make up door to door .
i can separate my fingers by one , by two ;
i can also move my eyes to the side , this one or this one , or both , and move my head without moving my body .
that's why i started to care for children and old people .
but the children grew up , and the old people ...
my friend used to say that i was born to be a clown .
poor thing , she died .
but that's another story .
a gigolo .
that's what i am .
an old gigolo .
i'm useless .
i can't even get a job as a laborer .
if i had known at this age i'd be supported by a woman .
i'm not any woman .
i'm your wife .
you'll throw that in my face one day .
it always happens .
you're already doing that so ...
robert , think of only one thing : ... everything we have .
we have each other , the kids , our grandchildren .
we did so many wonderful things .
we have loved each other so much .
promise me you're gonna go on fighting .
come on , robert .
look at a half full glass , not at a half empty one .
it's empty now .
hi .
nancy , baby !
nancy !
what a surprise , darling !
yes !
how are you?
how are the kids?
billy?
a tooth?
and elenita?
dad's ok .
yes , dad's working too .
because they changed his shift .
yes , with overtime .
he's quite happy .
very happy .
yes , yes .
yes .
okay , okay ...
i'll tell him you called .
did robertito call you?
he didn't call me this month .
i'm not worried .
if he calls you , tell him to call me .
all right .
can i talk to elenita?
i'm dying to hear her voice .
hello?
elenita !
yes , helen , helen .
how are you?
the school?
how is the school?
the blackboard , the pupil ...
yes .
the " gran padre " is very good .
very good .
yes , dear .
he call you , he call you .
i'll tell him .
me too .
kiss , kiss , kiss .
it seems mrs. saenz will get me a role in this soap opera .
she knows deep inside i'm an actress .
she told me to go to audition .
it's easy .
i have to study a text .
i know a lot of poems .
if things are transparent and clean , this time i think i'll get it .
me , on tv ...
i'm a bit scared .
i haven't acted for a long time !
well , i never acted , actually ...
i need a push .
who knows?
maybe i end up being famous and we can move .
i told you not to leave food there ...
the roaches ...
terrible things happen in life !
terrible things happen in life !
i don't know ...
terrible things .
terrible things ...
terrible things happen in life ...
i don't know .
terrible things happen in life ...
terrible things happen in life ...
give me this .
ok .
terrible things happen ...
ready?
yes .
you can start .
good luck .
who sent this dork?
i don't know .
you can start .
it doesn't matter if you don't remember the text .
you can say anything , improvise .
what ...?
here it says she was classically trained .
that's a relief .
please , turn around .
the other way .
dinner is ready " .
thanks .
we might call you .
ma'am .
she came to audition and she was so scared she peed .
and who was she?
an old woman .
she'll never forget it .
don't worry , nobody can tell .
don't pay attention to them .
don't make their day .
don't cry .
don't cry .
they're waiting for you .
let them wait .
i have to go .
lf you ever need anything , come and see me .
thanks .
do you know who i am?
you have a nice look in your eyes .
how much longer?
when will you realize you're with a man who's worthless?
why did you have to beat the guy?
they came to cut the power .
and they did .
i know , mecha told me .
the money was inside the sewing case .
lf i had known ...
lf i " had known " ...
what?
had known .
fuck me !
did you hear?
fuck me !
so many sacrifices ...
and for what?
we have a daughter who left us .
and a son ...
please !
you can't stand the truth .
please .
ma'am , could you come in?
i'll go .
robert , where are you?
robert !
robert?
why are you talking like that?
sometimes you make me laugh .
where are you?
enough , robert !
you've drunken enough .
let's go to bed .
you've drunk enough ...
you talk to me as if i were a piece of shit .
i can't find the candles .
where did i put them?
leave me alone .
please .
you don't like me anymore?
not when you're drunk .
who's drunk?
you !
come here !
let me go .
let go of me !
don't do this to me !
don't , robert !
not like this !
not like this !
it's a wonderful time for my career .
i have many projects and great possibilities .
are you making a movie in the us?
that's what my producer says .
you can interview him .
he's here .
you'll easily persuade him .
bye boys , thanks .
sandrita , just one minute .
i'm tired , francis .
i was telling mercedes you have great news for her .
just two minutes for latino entertainment network .
ready?
sandra , instead of talking about your projects , why don't you tell us about your most intimate dreams?
i love it .
they always ask me the same .
you aren't original at all .
now it's latino entertainment network's turn .
i honestly don't know what they expect me to say .
my dream is like anybody's dream .
my life maybe different , but my real dream is similar to anybody's .
my assistant , the make up lady , the cleaning lady , my classmates at school in villa adela , soap opera characters , my mum ...
we all dream the same .
that somebody will love us .
but not all of them dream of working for telemundo or shooting a movie with andy garcia .
you're right .
me neither .
you have the most important latin american tv channel and you say such nonsense .
you're crazy !
who are you to tell me what to do?
who am i?
who brougth you here from that boring town and made you a star?
a star , my ass !
in a week you'll be in miami ... ... to sign the contract to work with andy garcia .
what is it with you?
that's new .
what's wrong , honey?
why don't you tell me what you want?
do you really wanna know?
i don't want to sign squatt .
i wanna get rid of the mexican , andy garcia .
fuck miami , the doll , the perfume and all the fake guys like you !
i'm tired !
i can't stand this anymore .
sandra ...
i'll get the car and we'll talk .
sandra ...
it's you , isn't it?
i think so .
you told me if i ever needed anything ... yes , hop on .
what was your name?
cleopatra .
cleopatra?
my dad was the director of the william shakespeare theater ...
company in arroyo seco .
he loved classics .
he named my elder brother ...
what are you gonna do?
i have two options : do what i want or what i have to .
and do you know what you want?
then you'd better don't do anything .
eat an " empanada " .
thank you .
cleopatra ...
excuse me .
what do you call me for?
no , i'm not home .
really?
ask the mexican whore to sign that .
get it?
now he's desperate to make me sign .
he's realized he can't control me .
francis?
can you hear me ...?
my battery needs recharging .
the call will be cut off .
it was cut off .
well , i'm leaving .
no , why?
do you know what it is?
no .
me neither .
francis brought it from south africa and put it here .
if i touch it , he'll kill me .
everything is his ...
the apartment , the furniture ... ... my haircut , my eyes , my clothes ...
my famous cleavage ...
i'm a trademark .
i'm his possession .
didn't you like the " empanadas "?
yes !
i'll be right back .
i love massages .
i know how to massage .
i used to do that .
my daughter nancy liked me to massage her feet while she read her university notes in a loud voice and then recite them to me .
does she live with you?
no .
she moved to the states with her husband .
he couldn't find a job here .
what does your son do?
robertito?
he also left .
he left .
but he's different .
he's been different since he was a child .
a very good person and a bit sad .
his dad forced him to play rough games , " male games " , he'd say .
he never understood him .
though he says it's not true , he stopped loving him .
i can understand him better than anybody else , just by looking at him .
once he had an argument with my husband and he left .
i helped him with some money i had saved .
he left with a friend who had found a job in spain .
now he writes to me , calls me whenever he can .
when i can , i call him too .
he sounds good .
but i miss him a lot , more and more every day .
do you like ice cream?
yes .
hi , guido .
hi .
thanks .
that's ok .
can you sign this?
i already did .
it's for romina , my girlfriend .
turn around .
romina?
yes .
and this one's for amelia , the baker .
she doesn't believe i know you .
the ice cream's gonna melt .
bye .
thanks .
i can't really say he's a bad guy , but he doesn't know how to treat women .
he doesn't do it on purpose , he's just a bit brutish .
you're talking about francis?
my dad .
and her?
his wife?
we don't get along at all .
she smokes , drinks gin ...
and she has an obsession : my dad .
they started dating before my parents got divorced .
nobody told me but i saw them together in the car .
dad loves cars .
son of a bitch !
your dad?
francis .
you'll think i'm mixing everything , but i can't separate things .
i'm like that , a bit nuts .
crazy " sounds better .
some things i do better than others .
don't worry , me too .
but nobody realizes .
the same happens to me .
good morning ...
hi .
may i use your phone?
sure .
did you sleep well?
yes .
are you going on a trip?
yes .
use that one .
you have some messages .
yes , but don't touch them .
are you calling your husband?
tell him to give you a break .
a break?
yes , maternity leave .
what a mess !
would you like me to pack your backpack?
first , the heavy stuff ...
how nice !
and fold it well or everything will be wrinkled .
look what you've done to your hair !
don't you like it?
yes ...
but you're crazy !
well , take care .
promise you'll take care .
you too .
next time you pee on the floor , call me .
stop here , please .
bye .
bye .
what is it?
i forgot my glasses at your place , my purse , everything .
hop on .
you must want to kill me .
i'm sorry .
relax .
we'll buy another pair .
buy another pair?
we'll leave now .
where?
to hell .
where?
anywhere .
don't you dare?
no , you don't .
forget it .
maybe you're right ...
it must be difficult for you to forget about everything .
even for two days .
your home , your husband ...
the same clothes , no glasses ... no purse ...
what?
may i use your cell phone?
thanks .
hi , robert .
how are you?
did you sleep well?
no , i'm in the street .
no , from a cell phone .
it doesn't matter who it belongs to .
what's the problem?
ok ...
ok ... let me talk .
i'm very glad there was no power .
now you'll get away from that tv set .
only soccer and awful soap operas .
you watch so much tv your head is square .
i don't know what you can do .
if you're bored , go take a bath , go for a walk ,
look for a job .
ok , robert ...
ok .
robert ...
i can't hear you .
can you hear me?
i can't hear you .
it's going to cut off .
my battery needs recharching .
it's going to be cut off .
it cut off .
well ... here we go !
just two women alone in the world .
do you like this music?
not at all , but don't worry .
if you like it ...
hi !
good morning .
good afternoon .
is there anything to eat?
ask him if there are any free tables .
even if nobody believes it , i love francis .
but he's been so bad to me .
he's the producer , he's made me famous , i'm supposed to be tolerant .
i introduced him to my dad .
they got along from the very beginning .
they're both seductive , fake guys .
let me try .
yes , didn't know you smoked .
me neither .
so?
so nothing .
i wanted to have a producer , get out of my town , appear in magazines .
you're lucky you're an actress .
you can get into de soul of your characters .
you can be somebody else .
i didn't want to be an actress .
i wanted to be famous and i wanted my mom to see me .
two coffees and the check .
i'll be right back .
there's no coffee .
what does it say here?
sallads : two .
does it say " sallads "?
who wrote this?
barvecue " .
i've never seen that .
no offense was meant .
tell me , how do you spell " vomit "?
your daughter's vomiting in the restroom .
what is it?
sandra , what is it?
look , lady ,
let's be clear .
it's not the girl's fault but the mother's .
mother's and commercials '.
adults have to be careful .
you must be careful .
but i ...
excuse me?
yes , i'll be careful .
are you feeling better?
can i tell you something?
no .
what a mess i got you in .
no .
you're in a mess .
you shouldn't do that .
you know what i mean .
it's dangerous .
where are we?
i'd like to know .
i don't know .
at least we're far from that horrible place .
that waiter , " barvecue " ...
so bitter ...
we'll never come back there .
i forgot my cell in the restroom .
and it's the first time i've driven .
roberto never let me .
in arroyo seco , my dad used to sit me on his lap and i'd practise .
but i never drove again .
the taxi lasted us a day .
my dad said i was a very good driver but that i just got a bit distracted .
and you were going to be careful .
this time nothing serious happened .
but young lady , remember that at certain age , children stop being children and become their own parents 'parents .
such is life .
did you understand , darling?
your mom isn't young anymore ...
i'm not young anymore but i'm not old either .
and i don't like when people say " darling " or " love " if it's not true .
those words should be said when you mean them .
bye , darling , take care .
anybody comes now and kisses you .
it's a bit disgusting .
how are we gonna go back now?
where?
that's what i'm wondering .
where?
to go back or not to go back .
that is the question .
what are you going to do?
come with me .
and the van?
i left it at the mechanic's .
it's francis problem .
was it his?
what are you doing?
let the old creep wear it .
he's exaggerating .
it was nothing .
darling , darling " .
go kiss yourself !
what?
i think that crash helped me .
you're nuts !
do you still think they'd stop as soon as they saw you?
let me do it .
with short hair , i'm nobody .
nobody recognizes me .
who knows how long we'll be here .
come , sandrita !
this boy is humanitarian and will give us a lift .
so you were in a crash ...
what happened?
i don't want to remember .
who was driving?
i don't want to remember , i told you .
hitchhiking is dangerous .
there's nobody out there .
when somebody sees two women alone , they say " be careful , it's dangerous " .
can you turn that down?
well , he's right , in a way .
the driver could be a murderer .
not a murderer .
a rapist .
ma'am , i was just joking .
sure , joking !
i don't need a funny guy !
put yourself in her shoes .
you scared her .
can't you see she's an old lady?
she could've died .
are you talking about me?
yes .
ma'am , i never joke , really .
and you started joking today .
do what you want , but i won't get in .
you can't stay here .
it's getting late !
we're in the middle of nowhere .
we coud get raped for real .
where are you from?
la union .
160 miles from here .
and what do you do?
i raise horses .
it was my father's job .
is it a nice place?
i haven't been there .
you'd get bored .
what do you know?
did you recognize me?
what?
i don't know anything about you but i can imagine by looking at you .
and what can you imagine?
nothing .
i don't want to put my foot in my mouth again .
come on .
no , i'm not good at that .
you said you could imagine .
i thought that since you're from the capital city ...
besides , you're a bit wild for town life .
you're wrong .
what did you say?
wild " .
that's what we call the mares that rear ...
with all due respect .
you're comparing me to a mare .
i want to sleep .
turn left .
are you staying in villa adela?
yes .
where are we going?
turn left at the corner .
we're going to my dad's .
he's gonna die when he sees me .
where is it?
stop here .
what happened?
your d aughter
matilde?
what happened?
what was gonna happen .
thanks for coming , mili .
i'm asking you what happened .
she was playing cards .
she felt sick .
poor mom .
and my dad?
he went to the rally .
when will he be back?
don't ask me what i don't know .
what did you do to your hair?
i thought it was my dad .
fucking bitch !
hi .
i'm matilde .
i'm sorry , madam .
this is cleo .
come on .
i wanna change my clothes .
use my bedroom , mili .
mom's in yours .
do you want to see her?
cleo ...
you didn't tell me matilde was so young .
she has sad eyes .
well , her mother has just died .
she lied to you .
she doesn't care about anything .
she plays the martyr , and if it doesn't work , she says she has a headache .
speaking of which , i know why you throw up .
sandra ...
why didn't you tell me you couldn't drive?
because i can .
only i get distracted .
don't change the subject .
i ate too much .
stay out of this .
she called you mili , didn't she?
my name is milagros .
milagros is a nice name .
francis never liked it .
what did you think of carlos?
cleopatra ...
shall we go now?
thanks for the drive .
you saved me .
everybody knows me here , and if they get a hold of me ...
next time , i buy .
are you really leaving tonight?
why don't you leave tomorrow?
i'd lend you a room , but we're having a party tonight .
who died?
is what you have to do that important?
yes , i have to sign a deed .
ok , you decide .
bye .
wait !
i'll explain .
the ranch has been on sale for a while .
it was rented .
now someone is interested in it .
i'd like to put an end to it .
where is it?
in las piedras , near the andes .
is it a nice place?
i'm sorry , i thought it was my dad .
do you love him?
my old man?
sure , why not?
he's the only person i got .
he raised me .
his way , but ...
and your mom?
i haven't seen her for a while .
how long?
15 years .
15 years?
why am i telling you this?
and cleo?
is she a relative of yours?
i wish .

rancor .
no cure for that .

there's some ice over there .
it's ok .
are you alone , too?
exactly .
for long?
a long time .
do you have any children?
two .
i couldn't have any .
but i don't cry anymore .
it's over .
patricio and i wanted to have a boy .
i was sure i was gonna have a boy .
milagros was a child .
sometimes i think it would've been good for us all .
i was mili's english teacher .
that's how i met patricio and her mother .
he was heart broken when she left them .
he couldn't understand why she would ... ... leave him .
him ...
we started dating some time after that .
it's a pity patricio isn't here .
i would've liked him to meet you .
he's never here .
now i'm completely alone .
i'm a teacher too .
i have a headache .
do you have any boys?
i lied to you .
i don't have a husband or children .
i have nothing .

she's a new friend .
yes , but i'm on my way .

i said yes .
yes .
ok , bye .

good morning .
what time does the next bus to buenos aires leave?
in half an hour .

where is indio muerto?
can you buy me a sandwich?
are they your siblings?
and a ciggie?
what?
a ciggie .
so you want a cigarette?
and that's how you ask?
you should say ...
" ma'am , please ... " come on , repeat .
ma'am , please ...
would you be so kind would you be so kind
as to give me a cigarette? as to give me a cigarette?
come on , the whole thing .
ma'am , please , would you be so kind as to give me a ciggie?
i don't smoke .
and neither should you .
you're too young .
i think that's my bus .
cleo ...
i'm sorry .
i'm selfish .
i couldn't leave without saying goodbye to you .
i'm going with carlos .
where?
i don't know , a small town in the mountains .
i invited myself .
cleopatra ...
francis called .
where the hell are you going?
she turned out to be nuts .
are you talking about me?
look who's talking !
you invited me to spend an unforgettable weekend and i ended up alone , drunk and sleeping with a dead old woman .
you're right .
i'm sorry .
and i left you with that bitch ...
that " bitch " doesn't lead an easy life .
we'll talk about that .
did you hear what i said about francis?
no .
look ahead or we'll crash .
what is it?
i don't know .
this carlos guy is weird .
weird and has a gun .
motherfuckers .
they left it there , suffering ...
you sure you're not uncomfortable?
no , son .
on the contrary , it's fun .
sure?
sure .
you should rest in peace .
i mean ... a bit .
thanks .
like a forest path that disappears in the distance my life is fading away while i keep searching .
i've searched in the wilderness , i've searched blindly .
i've been searching for a way out all my life without realizing .
i've been searching for a way out .
i've searched for my destiny .
i've searched blindly dreaming of an open forest an immense sky that dazzies me .
deep inside , a woman is waiting .
it's myself .
a heart awaits .
it's my own heart and i'm filled with joy .
so full of joy .
so full of joy .
oh , what a moment !
oh , what a moment for my feelings to come out freely .
oh , what a moment !
oh , what a moment for my feelings to come out freely .
so full of joy .

oh , what a moment !
oh , what a moment for my feelings to come out freely .
so full of joy .

oh , what a moment !
oh , what a moment for my feelings to come out
freely .

where are you going?
sandra ...

i left home last night because i was tired of everybody telling me i'm not worth a cent .
i left without a fuss with my eyes straight ahead , but those black eyes made me crazy about you forever .
crazy , crazy , crazy .
crazy , completely crazy .
i'll be crazed if she decides not to look at me with those eyes .
crazy , crazy , crazy .
crazy , completely crazy .
and i need your love to live happily ever after .
i left home last night because i was tired of everybody telling me i'm not worth a cent .
you have your eyes shut !
it's the vertigo .

because i'd never done it .
i always thought it was like being in a ufo .
what happened?
what happened?
what happened?
sandra ...

what happened?
i don't know .
a power cut , i guess .
a power cut .

i don't know .
cleo wanted to take this ride .
why are you lying?
i lie?
what about you?
didn't i tell you i was in a hurry?
then go !
just what i needed .
a guy who bosses me around !
did you say " go "?
lf he goes , he's stupid .
lf he stays , he's mama's boy .
i can't believe he's leaving .
first choice .
much better , i was getting bored .
just like in " tower inferno " .
you have my backpack , right?
what backpack?
we're fucked !
yes , francis .
yes , you're right .
i needed some fresh air .
it was an unimportant crash .
no , i'm ok .
at an outdoor fair .
no , i'm not joking .
i'm at an outdoor fair .
kilometer number 600 .
ok .
i'll wait for you .
ok , bring a photographer , bring whatever you want .
i wasn't gonna leave with something that's not mine .
so you returned because you're so decent .
anyway , somebody's picking me up .
i didn't come back just for the backpack .
robert?

i'll go back soon .
soon , i don't know .
did anybody call?

i don't understand what you're saying .

they're waiting for me .
you didn't like my question .

you're mad at me .

you're pulling my leg .

i meant to tell you from the beginning .
you wouldn't listen .
you have been here before and you didn't tell me .
i'm going to the notary's office .

why should i go?
so that you can treat me like that?
sandra , sandra , a kiss ...
hi , sandra .
hi .
would you sign an autograph for us?
thanks .
will you come visit us some day?
be nice , sister .
i came here to rest .
thanks .
look !
put yourself in his shoes .
suppose you meet robert redford and he doesn't tell you anything .
well , robert redford speaks english and maybe you'd realize , but suppose it's our luppi .
no , luppi is my age .
the kid from titanic .
you meet him and he doesn't tell you anything .
what's his name?
i told him i worked on tv , but he was talking about something else .
he didn't realize or he didn't want to .
many people work on tv , but this kid is from the country .
anyway , it's over now .
it was good until he offended .
then what shall we do here?
i don't know .
take a walk , go back .
he's weird .
miss sandra , somebody for you .
what are you doing here?
why didn't you tell me who you are?
have you already signed?
no .
they changed their mind .
they lost their downpayment but they didn't care .
who are they?
they're american .
they wanted to buy cheap land here and find oil .
can i help you?
aitor is waiting for me .
he's the one who rents the ranch .
would you like me to go with you?
cleo ...
we're not going back .
we're not going back .
i'll go with him to his field .
he invited me .
i don't know what time i'll be back .
bye .
we're going back .
i got what you asked me for .
what did i ask?
didn't you want to visit a winery?
then i did one where i played a nun .
it was on in the evenings .
it was called " the mysterious nun " .
did you watch it?
don't worry .
there was another one where i played a blind girl .
the male star was the surgeon , typical ...
and at the end ...
at the end what?
at the end what?
at the end what?
what?
at the end he operated on me and i could see .
i became famous with that character .
you really don't know me?
my truck once overturned on this road .
it's a dangerous road .
i lit a cigarette and ended on a low shoulder .
i was 13 .
low shoulder?
yes , low .
this way , please .
which way?
waitresses , this way .
this way .
no , but where's the winery?
go change your clothes .
no , i ...

excuse me?
my van left .
your van left .
what am i gonna do now?
what are you gonna do ...
are you making fun of me?
and what did you come here for?
i came for a guided tour and it turned out to be a party .
and what do you do for a living?
me?
what do i do?
i'm an actress .
hi , carlitos .
i'll take the animals tomorrow .
aitor .
wait a minute .
this is for you .
i've always liked it .
my old man asked me to .
he decided this a long time ago .
cheers to the newly wed !
what are you gonna do?
about what?
about this house , everything .
i don't know .
if i can't rent it everything will be complicated .
i would give it away .
i don't want it anymore .
why can't you keep it?
you're nuts .
come on .
who told you to open it?
go on , go on ...
those geese aren't mine , they're aitor's .
no , they're free .
let's go for a walk .
tell me something .
like what?
i don't know .
anything .
something from your childhood .
look ...
that is where my brother was shot .
it was an accident .
they had been hunting and were cleaning the rifles .
his name was cesarito , he was 14 .
my mom went crazy .
dad didn't know what to do , how to comfort her .
we left overnight , as if we had all died .
i don't know what's wrong with the truck .
wait .
i'm sorry .
i thought it'd be good for you to stay here .
you think you have a right to everything .
you're right .
i have no rights .
next week i have to go to miami .
anyway , your face has changed since we got here .
those little horses ...
when i was a child , i used to play with them .
i hadn't seen them in a long time .
do you like this music?
it's what my grandpa used to listen to .
do you wanna know what it says?
on this rough land ... my mother gave me life .
and the land didn't give me the woman i love .
i'm going to the garden .
my beloved one is there
among birds who sing so beautifully .
all my love calls her from my heart .
calls her
like the birds who sing so beautifully .
calls her like the birds who sing so beautifully .
on this rough land where i was born .
nice , isn't it?
they were two cousins , pocho and toto .
pocho was a saint , toto , a bastard .
pocho studied to be a lathe operator and works very hard .
toto does odd jobs , he's so lazy .
pocho bought a motor bike ,
toto doesn't even have money to buy condoms .
don't tell me , you chose toto .
and i'm 3 months pregnant .
if you let him beat you now , you'll end up in hospital .
you have to do something !
that's easy to say , but when toto gets mad ...
i'm not saying it's easy but you can't let him beat you .
look at your face .
he could hurt the baby ...
what should i do?
what should i do?
pay attention .
you have to tell him ...
toto !
toto !
yes , what is it?
do you know what the police do te men who beat women?
no .
i'm a doctor .
i got my degree many years ago , in cordoba .
that's where i met the owner of this house .
he came to the mountains , and so did i.
he burned his bridges and so did i.
he got married but was never happy .
me neither .
actually , i'm not being fair .
i shouldn't be talking like that .
i realized i hadn't been happy when i got the chance to be happy .
you're surprised , aren't you?
i made you think .
don't worry .
my dad used to tell me to think more often .
think " , he said , " use your head , think of what you want .
but i was always busy and i didn't pay attention to him .
i never thought what i wanted to do or what i felt .
no , no ...
it all started four years ago , in new york .
i had been married for many years .
my wife , carmen , had always been sick .
then i met viviana at a medical conference .
she was married and she was working as a translator .
it was love at first sight and we lived ten days full of intensity and anxiety .
we didn't know we would see each other two more times .
i sent viviana a plane ticket to new york
to see her .
we had a date at the same hotel and room we had the first time .
when the day arrived ,
i said goodbye to carmen and told her i was going to another congress .
and i left .
i went to the airport and i sat at the departure lounge to wait for my flight to new york to be announced .
i listened to each of the five announcements , until they finally called me personally .
when the plane took off ,
i went home and had dinner with carmen , as usual .
i never knew if she had guessed it .
some months later , my wife died in her sleep , without suffering more than having to deal with her secrets and mine .
after a year
i couldn't help myself , picked up the phone and called viviana , but the number was no longer hers .
things were like that and ended like that .
at least i was with carmen and accompanied her until the end in those painful critical moments of suspecting compassion .
i'm sorry , but did you love your wife or the other one?
love?
i did what was expected of me .
i have a clean conscience .
i don't know if i did what was right or what was wrong .
i will go on living with that doubt .
what about you?
what about me?
are you married?
your husband is lucky .
do you think so?
yes , he's happy because i love him , but i used to love him more .
i'll tell you something .
i lied to you .
i'm not an actress .
my dad was the director of the william shakespeare theater company in arroyo seco , where i was born .
i remember some excerpts from plays by heart .
little texts .
terrible things happen in life .
i don't know ...
as if they were the wrath of god , as if before them everything one has suffered would get hold of your soul .
there are not many , but they exist .
they open dark marks in the rudest face and on the strongest back .
maybe they are the horses of attilas , or the black heralds sent to us by death .
those bloody things hitting us are the crepitations of some bread burning in an oven .
and man ... poor , poor man turns his eyes , as when somebody laps your shoulder ; he turns his crazy eyes and everything he has lived gets hold of his soul ,
like a guilt pond in his eyes .
terrible things happen in life ...
i don't know .
i said it !
like a forest path that disappears in the distance .
my life is fading away while i keep searching .
i've searched among the trees i've searched blindly .
i've been searching for a way out all my life without realizing .
i've been searching for a way out , i've searched for my destiny .
i've searched blindly .
dreaming of an open forest and an immense sky that dazzies me .
deep inside , a woman's waiting .
it's myself , a heart awaits .
it's my own heart and i'm filled with joy .
so full of joy .
so full of joy .
oh , what a moment .
oh , what a moment for my feelings to come out freely .
oh , what a moment .
oh , what a moment for my feelings to come out freely .
yes , robert , yes .
and the kids?
did the kids call?
no , i'm still here .
yes .
yes , robert , i heard you .
i heard what you said .
that everything will be like it was before .
before when?
what are you doing , sweetie?
what is it?
nothing .
what are you going to do?
i'm going back .
i'm leavin for buenos aires in an hour .
and i think ...
i'm going back alone , right?
i would've liked you to be my mom .
these are for your husband .
thank you !
bye .
you taught me a lot in these days .
i don't like farewells .
let's go .
now i have three choices : do what i must do , do what i want or do nothing and sit down to think .
like a forest path that disappears in the distance , my life is fading away while i keep searching .
i've searched among the trees , i've searched blindly .
i've been searching for a way out all my life without realizing .
i've been searching for a way out my destiny ...
i've searched blindly
dreaming of an open forest and an immense sky that dazzies me .
deep inside , another woman's waiting .
it's myself , a heart awaits .
it's my own heart and i'm filled with joy .
so full of joy .
so full of joy .
oh , what a moment .
oh , what a moment for my feelings to come out freely .
oh , what a moment .
oh , what a moment for my feelings to come out freely .
i've been searching for a way out withing my soul i've searched blindly .
i want life to knock me off my feet .
i've searched among the trees i've searched blindly .
i've been searching for a way out all my life without realizing .
so full of joy .
so full of joy .
oh , what a moment .
oh , what a moment for my feelings to come out freely .
oh , what a moment .
oh , what a moment for my feelings to come out freely .
so full of joy .
so full of joy .
oh , what a moment .
oh , what a moment for my feelings to come out freely .
so full of joy .
so full of joy .
oh , what a moment .
oh , what a moment for my feelings to come out freely .
