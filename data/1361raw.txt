and apparently so do the fans .
hey , shitheads !
listen up !
everybody on their feet for the warden .
anthony , wow .
you can sit down .
thank god .
gentlemen , texas marshals have been kind enough to supply us with a dozen of their finest sharpshooters .
so for those of you thinking of mingling with the civilians or trying to make a break for it , you will be shot .
in the head .
now , let's all go out there and have some fun !
crewe !
i'll see you on the field !
i think he's in love with you .
all right , listen up .
i know it's hard to get psyched for the game without caretaker being here .
but somehow that sick , skinny bastard found a way to get us all fired up from beyond the grave .
caretaker's last gift to us .
battle , i presume this is yours .
i still don't think that's big enough .
that's it?
no , that ain't it .
caretaker said he'd find us some gear to wear .
i think he found us a name too .
mean machine !
mean machine !
mean machine !
mean machine !
good afternoon and welcome to a very special edition of espn football .
as today , the semipro allenville federal prison guards will be taking on the very prisoners they guard .
and with this special game , folks , comes a special broadcast , as i'm joined in the booth by baby face bob .
say hi to the folks , bob o.
chris , we went to a commercial .
this job , bob , it's a lot of give and take .
so when i bring you in , don't be afraid to talk to the folks .
unless you don't want to .
and here come the cons ,
led by former nfl mvp quarterback paul crewe .
holy shit .
hey , hey , hey .
well , hello .
how are you?
back away from the girls !
hey , now .
call me !
what the hell are you dressed up for?
hey , i didn't spend 14 years in the joint just to watch this game .
and there in the high security bleachers are the good behavior cons , along with their ... ... cheerleaders?
we're the mean machine don't mean to dis you
we're gonna kick your ass and then we'll kiss you
hey !
ho !
what?
i didn't do it !
come on , batt !
what's that?
did you see that?
damn it !
papajohn's at the 20 , the 10 .
and he will score .
sweet dreams , bitch .
that's a 90 yard return .
and i gotta tell you , the cons seem more interested in hitting the guards than tackling the ball carrier .
hey , mom .
hey , dad .
thanks for picking me up from school .
and here comes the big story of the day .
paul crewe , serving a three year sentence , hasn't played since he was banned from the nfl six years ago .
center , shift it !
shift it !
hey , sasquatch !
twenty , hut !
crewe drops back to pass .
turley's leaving him unprotected .
fumble !
holy shit !
goddamn it .
that's gonna be a personal foul on the big guy .
and this is certainly an inauspicious start for the cons .
come here !
all right !
you got him .
now , protect me !
let's go !
hold them !
and here comes knauer and that big offensive unit for the guards .
eighty six .
back to your cell .
hut !
hut !
knauer has potter wide open .
touchdown , guards .
son of a bitch !
and in the first 90 seconds , the guards are up by two touchdowns .
this one looks like it could be over early .
sorry .
what are we celebrating for? !
it's 14 nothing !
you guys wanna beat these assholes , do it on the scoreboard !
are you okay?
oh , god , you're not hurt , are you?
jesus , you sound like my mother .
listen , if you wanna cry , you go ahead and cry .
i'll cry with you .
get off me !
get back out there and kick some ass !
why are you yelling at me?
all i did was care !
look !
a broken leg will heal .
a loss to the mean machine lasts forever .
sorry , guys .
yeah , yeah .
me too .
all right .
now , let's get started !
now , get the hell out there !
let's go !
way to go !
way to go !
there's the first sign of life from the cons .
let's see if paul " motley " crewe can make something happen .
hut !
on first down , crewe will throw .
he's got deacon wide open .
that's gotta be pass interference .
but the ref is waving it off .
what? !
oh , come on !
come on , now .
i'm in this hellhole for less than that .
be a man and make a call .
you're right .
unsportsmanlike conduct !
eighty eight black !
what? !
come on !
this is baby back bullshit !
bullshit , d.
calm down .
let it go .
let's call that one a questionable call .
blue 42 , hut !
the give is to megget .
he spins to the outside .
megget has room .
he's at the 35 .
the 40 .
he's brought down hard , by his facemask .
what?
oh , come on , man !
that was a facemask !
you're not gonna call that?
i saw a clean tackle , sir .
what you looking at?
are you serious?
tell it to the parole board , criminal .
i mean , this is absurd .
we can't win with the refs on the payroll !
listen up .
i got an idea to end all this bullshit .
come on , let's all stay up !
come on !
down , set !
red 58 .
cover your man !
red 58 .
hut !
that one hurt my marble sack .
all right !
you all right?
yeah .
what down is it?
fifth .
no , no .
it would be fourth down .
okay .
what do you think?
should i go for the left nut this time?
underneath !
let's go !
ref , you gotta get in the game !
right over here !
well , i don't quite get this , but on fourth and 22 , the cons are gonna go for it .
down , set !
red 58 .
red 58 .
hut !
you gotta always protect the mcnuggets .
how about from now on , you call a fair game?
how's that sound?
sounds good .
okay .
wet willie .
yeah , you like that .
and so the guards will take over after one of the strangest offensive series i've ever seen .
okay , boys .
we know who doesn't have any balls out there now .
have we got any?
have we got some balls?
yeah !
all right !
let's go kick some ass !
come on , swit , stand them up , baby .
white 50 .
white 50 .
hut , hut , hut !
knauer , play action .
here comes the blitz .
switowski is so big , it's like being tackled by a coke machine with legs .
this is fun !
nice to see you smiling , bob .
thanks , chris .
green 90 !
hut !
third and 5 , and the give is to megget .
he's to the 40 , where he'll come up short .
but look at turley push the pile .
and now crewe .
and that's a first down !
and look out .
boy , somebody better take control of this game soon , or they're gonna need body bags on the sidelines .
let's go , guys .
start of the second quarter .
cons still down by two touchdowns , but they finally have some momentum .
hut !
crewe with a shovel pass to megget .
and megget scrambles for a first down .
oh , you fooled me .
i got you there , didn't i?
you did .
you know , engleheart , you are the best looking guy on your team .
you know , paul , in the midst of all this , for you to say something like that is ...
come on , let's go .
let's go , d.
first and 10 at the guards '35 .
crewe dumps it over the middle to deacon moss .
and he's hammered at the 17 for a 13 yard pickup , and that's a first down .
hut !
crewe , trying to get his team on the scoreboard .
he will throw .
and it's caught by deacon moss for a touchdown !
all right !
and so there'll be no shutout today , as the cons are on the board .
quit booing , people .
both teams are trying very hard !
what the hell's wrong with you?
stop acting like a damn cheerleader !
sportsmanship , try it .
shut up .
damn .
2 : 11 left in the first half .
and dunham is back in at fullback .
and he is a load , at 6'2 " , 260 .
dunham , breaking tackles .
he refuses to go down .
but he finally does after a 15 yard gain .
that's how a white man runs a football .
if i was on d , i'd crack you square in that egg ass head of yours .
yeah , but you ain't on d.
are you , bitch?
switowski !
come here .
do you know what he said to me in the library?
yes .
him .
out .
d , d , defense d , d , defense
the cons don't seem to have an answer for dunham , who's averaging close to 12 yards a carry this half .
green 67 .
green 67 .
hut !
oh , what a hit on dunham by switowski .
i think i made him shit himself .
shit !
i think he just shit himself .
i think he just shit himself .
good lord .
this guy shit himself bigtime .
see?
i told you i made him shit himself !
yo !
i'll make sure i send them books to the hospital , pimp .
and some diapers .
nineteen seconds .
we got a lot of ground to cover .
so you bastards remember that play we practiced in the mud?
what are you talking about?
that was some schoolyard bullshit .
yeah .
let's try some schoolyard bullshit .
come on , d , let's go .
down , set !
green 88 .
green 88 .
hut !
the clock starts to run .
crewe hands the ball to megget .
it's a reverse .
cheeseburger eddy's got it .
go , baby , go !
he laterals to deacon .
tackle him !
to turley .
the clock is running .
to brucie .
shades of cal stanford .
back to crewe .
he tosses to megget .
tackle him !
and look at that little megget run .
three seconds left .
yeah !
go !
he could go all the way .
touchdown !
did you see that? !
do that sound again .
i like that .
14 all .
bring it in .
do you have any idea who's beating you out there?
this was supposed to be a blowout , and they're showing you up in front of the whole nation .
the whole nation !
i like it when he's angry .
i told you !
way to go , baby , way to go .
what in the hell do you think you're doing out there?
playing football , sir .
i didn't say nothing about winning .
we're not winning .
not yet .
you got yourself in quite a predicament , mr. crewe .
is that right?
see , it's just come to my attention that inmate unger has been taken into custody for the murder of caretaker .
good .
oh , yeah , it's good .
only thing is , he claims to have an accomplice .
claims you knew all about it .
hell , he even says you sent caretaker to your cell .
bullshit .
captain knauer says he saw you planning it with unger .
there's no way that could hold up in court .
court?
hell , boy , in allenville , i'm the judge , i'm the jury , and in your particular case , i'm the executioner .
what do you want?
i want you to lose .
i can't do that .
of course you can .
after all , you've had plenty of practice .
but the men .
it's more important to them than it is to you .
okay .
suit yourself .
spend the next 25 years of your useless life in prison .
all right , i'll do it .
but i don't want my guys hurt .
you get ahead , you coast .
we clear?
fine .
right after i get a two touchdown lead .
i tell you what bothers me the most , warden .
that you're not gonna be out there on that field with us , getting what you got coming to you .
the only thing coming to me is victory .
mean machine .
it's cute .
let's go , boy !
we can do it , baby !
captain .
may i have a word?
don't worry , warden , we'll take care of business .
i already have .
what?
we can win this on our own .
captain , a man in my position doesn't leave things to chance .
now , after you get a comfortable three touchdown lead ,
i want you to inflict as much pain as humanly possible .
do not let up , you hear?
i want those cons to understand who owns them .
do i make myself clear?
oh , yes , sir .
good .
there's the kickoff , and we're under way in the second half .
megget is finally brought down at the guards '33 , where paul crewe will take over .
and what a first half he's had .
here we go !
here we go !
down , set !
y 45 .
hut !
on first and 10 , crewe will pass .
he's got deacon wide open .
come on .
oh , incomplete .
it's okay .
get your head up .
it's all right , man .
come on , paulie .
second and 10 from the 33 .
crewe's looking for deacon once again .
he's open !
he's open !
but overthrows it .
and it's picked off by papajohn .
look out !
he might go .
say goodbye .
touchdown !
the first mistake crewe's made all day .
short memory , baby .
we'll get it back .
we'll get it back .
defense , let's do this !
8 : 38 left in the third quarter , and crewe has struggled thus far in the second half .
hut !
the pitch to megget .
oh , my !
that ball is live !
it's picked up by lambert .
he's at the 15 , the 10 , and he will score !
yeah !
touchdown !
yeah !
crewe took a shot on that play and he's getting up slowly .
meanwhile , in the end zone , the guards have something to celebrate , as they find themselves up by two touchdowns .
this is simply a different paul crewe we're seeing here in the second half .
there's the old paul crewe we love to write about .
what the hell are you doing out there?
i'm done .
i'm out .
that's it .
where you hurting?
my knee .
seems okay to me .
well , it ain't .
if crewe can't go , i don't know how deep these guys are at quarterback .
the guards will try to keep it away from megget , so they'll pooch kick .
fair catch .
fair catch .
as big tony calls for the fair catch .
watch out .
that was as late a hit as i've ever seen .
and even some of the home crowd not liking that one .
hang in there , partner .
can of corn .
can of corn , and i'll be fine .
can of corn .
yeah , i'd have a hard time looking at me too .
brucie .
yeah , coach .
you're the only one that knows this offense , son .
now , do it .
coming into the game , replacing the injured paul crewe , is number 1 , brucie .
all right , all right .
crewe's playing like shit .
that's his problem .
i'm gonna bring us back .
right , 32 flex dive motion on one .
ready !
break !
yeah .
it's brucie's time to shine , baby .
okay .
down , set .
hut !
there's the snap and the ball is fumbled .
and the guards recover .
i knew i shouldn't have had that popcorn .
the guards are in command here as we move late into the third quarter .
ninety eight .
hut !
hut !
the give is to potter .
back to knauer .
he's got a man open deep downfield .
he'll throw the flea flicker !
and he's got it .
touchdown , guards .
and this game is starting to look like a blowout .
hey , man , after all caretaker did , this is how you show him love?
don't worry about it .
you haven't changed one damn bit .
all right .
down , set !
back in at quarterback is brucie , who will try to find a handle on the ball this time .
throw it , brucie !
oh , shit !
and look out .
what a shot he took !
how much more blood do you want?
i think the cons are just about out of options at quarterback .
hey , skitchy , let me ask you something .
when you popped the warden , was it worth it?
was it worth spending the rest of your life in here?
was it worth it?
it was worth every goddamn second .
what the hell is he doing?
paul crewe must be feeling better , because here he comes .
all right , i missed you guys , so i'm back .
we got a lot of work to do .
let's get it going .
deuce right , 89 .
fly on two .
ready?
break .
as we start the fourth quarter , cons down by three touchdowns .
wide left !
tight left !
black 90 .
hut !
hut !
here comes the blitz , and no one's blocking !
and crewe will be sacked for a big loss .
that looked like a message to crewe from his offensive line .
did you see that , man?
they're quitting on him .
okay , baby .
jailbreak blitz .
ready?
we got that out of the way .
i deserved it .
now we gotta play some football .
switch it !
switch it !
cons need to do something to get back in this game .
and that's not it !
and crewe is leveled !
i don't think he's gonna get up from that one .
nice hit !
but he is .
and i don't know how , after that last hit .
all right , punt team !
keep them off the field !
we're going for it .
dumbshits are going for it !
let's go !
let's go !
come on back , if he wants to get his ass kicked .
come on back .
this is unbelievable .
fine .
you guys don't wanna help me , i'll do it on my own .
on two .
let's go , to the line .
on fourth and 20 , the cons are gonna go for it .
this could be the ball game right here .
red 98 .
hut !
hut !
crewe dodges the blitz , but he loses his helmet .
and he's not going down .
he's got the first down .
time out !
man , oh , man .
not bad .
huddle up .
look .
i'm sure you already know this , but i never said it out loud .
i did throw that game .
i did it .
i was in a bad way with some worse people .
after i did it ,
i felt so shitty i wish i would have just let them kill me instead .
now the warden wants to pin caretaker's murder on me if i don't throw this game .
so it looks like i'm gonna get to know you guys a lot better , because i ain't doing that twice in a lifetime .
we got a little time left .
we can still do this .
i'm begging you .
put your hands in here .
okay .
thank you .
now , who are we?
mean machine !
come on , mean machine , let's go !
that's great news .
all right .
we got ourselves a game .
brown 65 .
hut !
first and 10 from the 30 .
crewe finds deacon open in the flat .
hut !
the give is to megget .
and he fights his way for a 9 yard gain .
one yard , baby .
one more yard .
hut !
hut !
crewe tries a sneak .
or is it?
he flips it back to megget .
megget's got the first down and more .
and megget is down to the 4 yard line , where it'll be first and goal .
hut !
crewe hands it to turley .
and look at the big man go .
tackle him !
touchdown !
that was some rumbling , bumbling stumbling right there .
and listen to the crowd as this underdog con team is starting to win them over .
third down and 6 .
guards have the ball on their own 29 yard line .
knauer needs a first down to put this game away .
white 50 !
white 50 !
and look at battle take off .
he knocks the ball loose !
there's a dogpile in the backfield .
the refs are trying to sort it out .
my arm !
the cons recover !
we got the ball !
we got the ball !
we got it !
we got it !
with just over two minutes left to be played , this has turned into a game .
crewe will start in great field position at the guards '25 .
and look at this formation .
the guards , they're confused .
shift over !
move !
they're trying to call time out , but there's the snap .
moss is behind a wall of cons .
i wouldn't wanna be in front of that thing .
and they'll score !
hey !
is that legal?
yeah , it is .
is that a touchdown?
yes , it is .
what is going on here?
shit !
and with the extra point , the cons are down by just seven .
brucie !
yeah .
yeah , coach .
i want you to go out there and kick off .
i can do it .
kick off !
brucie can't kick worth a shit .
i know .
recover the ball .
jesus christ , my savior .
if you help me out with this one ,
i promise to stop cheating on my wife with black guys .
amen .
back in the game is brucie , and he'll do the honors .
and it's a horrible kick .
but the ball is tipped !
and the cons have come up with it !
we got it !
one time out .
got it .
got it .
that's it , brucie .
hey , hey !
my bad .
my bad .
my bad .
come on .
give me that .
damn ...
well , that felt unnecessary .
cons have enough time for one final drive .
crewe drops back to pass .
he's under pressure .
watch the pass !
he's looking for deacon .
he gets the ball up , but he's leveled .
and deacon's got it for a first down , but he stayed inbounds .
tick , tick , tick .
the clock keeps running .
clock's running .
clock's still running !
clock's still running !
on the ball !
goddamn it !
do something !
hut !
crewe .
he's looking to throw .
under pressure again .
go !
get rid of it !
go !
go !
he pitches it to megget .
he's got some room .
here we go .
here we go .
go , megg !
go , megget !
go , megget !
get him !
he could go all the way !
but he won't !
goddamn it !
and megget is hit hard at the 4 , and he's hurt .
my knee , man !
you busted your knee for us , we'll bust our ass for you .
hey , coach , i need a back !
just win this shit .
i'm going in .
coach , you serious?
yeah , i'm serious .
and look who's coming into the game .
you can do it !
get that old ass of yours in the end zone !
we gotta win this thing !
come on !
no , no , no .
hey , old man .
absolutely not .
you're gonna get killed out here .
they've been trying that for years .
don't worry , i got the perfect play .
i ain't handing you the ball .
you don't have to .
nate scarborough , the former heisman trophy winner from 1955 , is gonna play tailback , but he's gotta be in there more for moral support than anything .
mean machine .
mean machine .
mean machine .
mean machine .
mean machine , mean machine mean machine
mean machine !
mean machine !
six seconds left on the clock .
cons down by seven .
they must score on this play .
don't let them through !
down , set !
black 99 !
come on , d !
black 99 !
hut !
hut !
the give is to the big man , turley .
he's stopped by lambert at the line for no gain .
no !
wait !
the ball's picked up by scarborough .
come on !
touchdown !
what an amazing comeback , folks !
taking a play from the old nebraska playbook .
the fumblerooskie .
easy .
easy .
you still alive , old man?
never felt better in my life .
you're a sick bastard .
come here .
all right .
and now the cons are a mere extra point away from overtime .
mean machine !
we go for the win?
we go for the tie?
hell , guys , we're convicts .
we always go for it all .
unfortunately , that's why we're all in the joint .
what would caretaker do?
give me that blackboard .
yeah , come on !
come on .
are you serious?
i don't know .
that play is wack .
it's gonna work .
it's gonna work .
let's go .
on the ball .
come on !
let's go !
let's go , y'all !
let's go !
i think it's gonna work .
get them out there .
and wait a minute .
crewe is coming back into the game .
the cons are gonna go for the win .
they're going for it .
crewe , trying to settle his team into formation .
but there seems to be a lot of confusion .
come on !
run the play !
turley !
turley .
over here .
move your giant ass right here !
right here .
come on , baby .
come on .
the play clock is still running .
crewe better call a time out .
come on , crewe !
they don't know what we're doing !
run the play we set up .
i think you're still dizzy from that hit !
the snap is to deacon .
it's a trick .
he throws it to crewe .
they did it !
unbelievable !
the cons win !
we win !
group hug in the shower tonight !
or not .
or not .
well , there you have it .
a bunch of ruthless criminals have beaten the men that uphold our justice system .
criminals are people too , chris .
now , give me your wallet .
what?
just kidding .
you got a lot of balls , crewe .
you played a hell of a game .
and don't worry , i know you had nothing to do with caretaker's murder .
and i'll back that up .
thank you , baby .
mean machine !
mean machine !
you humiliated me .
i can't believe you couldn't even win a fixed game .
now , where the hell does he think he's going?
he's escaping .
he's escaping .
officer , shoot that man !
but , sir , there's people .
shoot him .
crewe !
captain , i order you to shoot that prisoner .
shoot him !
fire !
crewe !
damn it , i'm giving you an order , captain !
crewe !
pull the trigger !
it's the game ball .
hey .
why don't you stick this in your trophy case .
you have a nice time , old man?
yeah .
yeah?
okay .
so , what do we do now?
well , the first thing is , we tell the team where they're hiding unger .
oh , i can't wait to see what switowski does to him .
great game , sir .
that's a week in the hotbox !
who gives a shit?
