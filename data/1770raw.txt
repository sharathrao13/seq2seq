white horses
# on white horses let me ride away
# to my world of dreams so far away
# let me run
# to the sun
# to a world my heart can understand
# it's a gentle , warm and wonderland
# far away
# stars away
# where the clouds are made of candyfloss
# as the day is born
# when the stars are gone
# we'll race to meet the dawn
# so , when i can only see the grey
# of a sad and very lonely day
# that's when i
# softly sigh
# on white horses , snowy white horses , let me ride away
take a step forward .
and another one .
and another .
# where the clouds are made of candyfloss

she would be .
it's better not to expect too much .
that's why you need to work hard .
what is that on your fingernails?
marina wears it .
well , it looks silly on you .
some people are pretty people , and some people are clever people , which is more important than looks .
marina's mother was a croupier .

rimbaud , baudelaire , verlaine ,
nothing that a good course of antidepressants couldn't cure .
or maybe 25 years in psychoanalysis .
why should we be subjected to their mother fixated outpourings? " you ask .
we get enough of that from our boyfriends .
remember , it's just as relevant to talk about lou reed or ... adam ant in your essay .
precisely what barthes was saying in the '50s , and what baudrillard is saying now .
so , questions?
yes?
the young lady in the green sweater .
oh .
yes , erm ...
do you think a deconstructive approach to literary criticism
leads to a cooler , less emotional response from the reader?
that's an interesting one .
that is the question .
what's your name?
holly rossman .
holly , holly .
very good .
you see , the thing about critical theory that is important ... holly ... holly rossman .
shh .
socialist worker !
holly ...
stuart , not now .
we've got to discuss some work with our tutor .
i'll phone you .
holly , come on !
socialist worker !
i was just kidding about adam ant , right?
don't do that to me !
but it is so important to have a visceral reaction to the text .
but that's so reductive .
oh , absolutely .
it's not .
it's the emotion expressed that matters .
do you know tarkovsky?
it's like tarkovsky .
oh , i love tarkovsky .
do you?
oh , he's my favourite director .
tarkovsky and bergman .
i'm reading bergman's autobiography now .
oh , my god !
cokane in my brain
great song .
you know i've got to figure out where to get my drugs .
erm ... i can get you some coke , if you like .
no probs .
do you know nostalgia?
that's my favourite tarkovsky .
yes , it would be .
she likes brooding .
it's on her cv .
suffering and brooding . " isn't it , holl?
i love brooding
you must be jewish .
why?
we'd better go to semiotics .
holly , are you coming?
you guys gotta get to class?
no .
another drink?

i know .
he fancies himself so much .
poseur .

that's your rob behind the bar .
where?
there .
holly , it's over .
is it?
yeah .
did my voice sound really squeaky?
no , you asked a brilliant question .
he loved it .
i always wonder what people like that are really like , underneath all that crap .
and did you see his shoes?
loafers with yellow socks !
yellow socks !
i know .
it's better than a beret , though .
wooh !
oi , fuck off !
holly !
ben , do you believe in life after death?
don't you ever want to think about something serious?
no .
no , i ... just want to be unconscious .
ben ...
mm?
can you ... get us some coke , please?
coke?
mm .
what's wrong with sulphate?
it's for a rich mate .
oh , yeah?
what rich mate?
no one .
the sweetest girl
that is an interesting one , isn't it?
yes , that is the question .
the question to ask .
holly ... rossman .
# the weakest link in every chain
# i always want to find it
# the strongest words in each belief
# find out what's behind it
# the politics is prior to
# the vagaries of science
# she left because she understood the value of defiance
special delivery .
oh , great .
perfect .
thanks .
look , a few of us are going to a club on saturday .
do you want to come?
sure .
yeah?
we could try some of this , right?
all right .
saturday , then .
bye .
holly , this is much better than most undergraduate work .
no ... i don't think i articulated it very well .
the bit about desire and metaphor with the integration of ...
do you want to get a cup of coffee?
oh , ok .
great .
you got that?
oh , yeah .
god , i used to pretend i was catholic .
i thought it made me seem more ... alluring .
do you think being jewish makes you more neurotic?
not at all .
i was never interested in jewish girls when i was in school .
i'd go crazy for these ... rejecting brnnnhilde types .
still do , in fact .
now , would you say that was neurotic?
yes !
erm ...
you know , it'd be really helpful if i could ... er ... just meet once more to show you a rough draft , before i ...
ok . .. hand it in .
er ... want to come by for tea on sunday?
ok .
erm ... great .
thanks .
er ... my bag .
oh .
er ... see you later .
can you imagine how some people sleep with tutors?
how desperate can you get?
someone like you would do that .
the thing about blokes is , don't ever be yourself .
you've got to have a gimmick , like " intense and difficult " .
you could do that easily .
oh , thanks !
shall i come out with you and ben?
you know , you look a bit peaky , actually .
do i?
mm .
why don't you stay in bed?
tuck up with a book?
i'll see you later .
all right .
mm .
kings of the wild frontier
# i feel beneath the white there is a redskin , suffering
# from centuries of taming

my flatmate , paul .
this is daniel , my erm ...
tourist .

# no method in our madness
# yay !
# just pride about our manner
# yay !
come on .
let's have it , then .
the coke , daniel .
right .
nag nag nag
# nag , nag , nag
# nag , nag , nag
# nag , nag , nag
# nag , nag , nag
it's the connection of desire to reality that possesses revolutionary force .
don't you think so , daniel?
body talk
# morning , afternoon and night
# we're laying together , side by side
# searching for lust , searching for breath
# searching for the touch of life
# no words are spoken
# the only sound in here is ...
hey .
mm .
oh ...
jesus .
i'm wrecked .
when i was a child , i used to go in and watch my parents sleeping , when they were together .
they're not together any more .
i can't imagine you ever being a child .
you know , marina ...
i'm going to have to be careful .
if this gets out , you could be in a lot of trouble .
i won't tell a soul , i promise .
clandestine's my favourite word .
all right .
what's your favourite word?
sleep .
i'm an old man , you know .
no , you're not .
no?
you weren't an old man last night .
ah , well , that was last night .
mmm ... ok .
ohh !
what?
oh , jesus .
that coke was amazing .
just need a little sleep .
just a little bit of sleep .
i'll call you .
i'll call you later .
hi .
come back to me in dreams , that i may give , pulse for pulse , breath for breath .
speak low .
lean low .
as long ago , my love .
long ago .
i always loved that stanza when i was young .
mm .
do you ever feel excluded from rossetti's mysticism , being jewish?
oh , that's right .
you wanted to be catholic , didn't you?
well ...
i think you're very interesting , and very jewish , and both are possible .
holly , i don't think this is a good idea .
no .
no , i know .
no , i'm sorry .
don't be upset .
please don't ... don't be upset .
no , please , don't ...
it's ok .
all right .
selfish , shallow bitch !
you're about as deep as a fucking coma victim !
you ... you're gonna die a vacuous old slut !
and you can keep your crap paintings , cos they're crap !
it's better than dynasty .
fuck off !
do you think i'm shallow?
course not .
just cos i don't read fucking books .
doesn't mean you're not soulful .
oh , soulful like holly ...
who mentioned holly? .. who's sensitive and committed to causes?
she's a really scared person .
and she thinks too much .
i mean , you can't experience things by reading about them in novels .
you know , we've got to really be careful .
i know .
i won't say a word .
that is ... if you want to see me again .
hey ... of course i want to see you again .
god , you look so beautiful ... and strange .
i'm so glad you dumped stuart , holl .
he was always weird .
do you feel guilty about ben?
erm ... yeah , a bit , i suppose .
maybe you're right .
maybe we should all have one person .
like a real soul mate .
marina?
what?
nothing .
you always do that .
no , it's nothing .
i'll tell you another time .
tell me
you're so annoying .
let's go for tea or a nice long walk .
mm?
i thought coke and speed were more your style .
well , you obviously don't know me very well , do you?
you think i'm shallow , don't you?
my friend , marina , i've known her since we were ten .
she just never changes or wants me to change .
i used to be so in love with her brother nat .
talk about romantic projections .
christ !
i'd just melt when he came into the room .
actually , i probably still am , in that yearning , proustian way ...
jesus , holly !
do you ever stop talking?
daniel ...
let's do it here .
right now .
hm?
you could just pull up my skirt and throw me down in these muddy leaves ...
holly !
holly !
what ... what's the matter?
nothing .
nothing is the matter .
will you stop asking me what the matter is?
i just ... i don't feel like fucking in a crummy , wet wood .
that's all .
i'm sorry .
there's a bergman on at the duke of york's tonight .
you don't really like that shit , do you?
erm ... sometimes i do , actually .
all right .
which one do you like best?
er ... wild strawberries .
that's the one that's on tonight .

the black and white one .
oh , fuck off .

mm .
god , what a bitch !
well you did the right thing .
love stinks .

i'll look after you .
gonna come?
mm .
yeah .
daniel , it's holly .
hi .

# i just can't get enough
it's really nice to see you again , holl .

oh , it's the coldest house on the planet .
i know .
so , er ... where do you want to sleep?
there's marina's floor , or her bed , until she gets in , or who with .
or there's a sofa in sophie's room , but she's in there with some drummer .
anywhere's fine .
let's finish this first .
oh , i can't believe how much you've changed .
is that good?
yes .
thanks a lot !
i'm going to get in , too .
i can feel tb coming on .
brrr !
i'll crash in marina's room when you want to go to sleep .
oh , i can never get to sleep .
marina just puts her head down and she's out .
yeah , i used to stick things up her nose when we were on holiday , and draw moustaches on her in felt tip pen .
she never used to wake up .
i had no idea you were such close friends .
bollocks .
girls were never interested in me before .
this is new for me .
i don't know what to do .
all right .
i'm an asshole .
is that what you want?
yeah .
do you think i enjoy having you come in here at two in the morning , screaming and yelling?
i mean , that's ridiculous .
marina , what we had was sex .
listen .
fuck off !
just fuck off !
shall i read you a soothing story?
crime and punishment .
perfect .
raskolnikov pulled the axe quite out , swung it with both arms , and scarcely ... scarcely conscious of himself ... .. and almost without effort , almost mechanically , brought the blunt side down on her head .
he seemed not to use his own strength in this .
as soon as he had once brought the axe down , his strength returned to him .
hello .
you've still got your hat on .
hey .
where are you going?
it feels weird .
yeah , i know .
holly ... are you seeing someone?
not stuart?
no .
i was .
sh sh should i not be now?
it's up to you .
oh .
do you want me not to be?
do you want me to want you not to be?
i think so .
you know i do .
don't be , then .
don't be !
don't be !
well , i should go and finish it , then .
mm .

go on .
i can't !
now , promise that you'll call me .
i will .

marina .
they were ...
he was with her .
what? !
the fucking bastard !
i didn't ...
i can't ... i can't believe it .
i don't understand why she would do this to me .
listen .
forget about him .
he's obviously a wanker .
no , he's not a wanker .
i just ...
i just can't believe it !
she must just hate me .
shh .
she didn't even want him until i did .
i just can't believe it !
she always does this to me .
oh , god .
what if she knows about me?
oh , who cares?
d does she?
what ...
i mean , did she tell you?
oh , god , she told you !
shh .
i can't bear this !
i can't bear this .
i can't bear this .
what about last night , holl?
no !
just forget it , please .
forget it !
for fuck's sake !
hey .
come in .
look , you can't feel any worse about this than i do .
i never knew you were such close friends .
with her it was never anything more than just the ...
god , you are such an incredible girl .
woman .
and someday , you're gonna meet some guy your age . who's really ...
if you see her or phone her again , i'm going to the vice chancellor to report you .
how incredible is that?
where's nat?
he's gone .

how many men were you thinking of collecting , holly?
what do you mean?

yes , and he's gone to paris with isabel .
do you know he's married?
who?
oh , for god's sake !
marina , can we please just talk about this?
i knew that you liked him at first , but i didn't think you'd do anything about it .
cos i'm so mousy and boring?
no ...
well , yeah , if you say so .
yeah .
oh , just because i don't shag the entire campus?
oh , is daddy's girl unhappy?
i'm going to bed .
could you get out , please?
you'd better change the sheets .
you don't know where i've been .
# i call her name

that's my girl !
maxie !

happy new year .

oh , daniel .
yeah .
that's great .
it's fine .
good .
that's great .
i ... erm ... i'm sorry about the way that i ...
it's just that i was so ...
yeah , it's probably for the best .
of course .
absolutely .
linda seems really good .
she gave us all a real shock .
isabel was great .
she's so sure .
she really knows what she wants .
that's good .
isabel , this is holly .
hello .
hi .
nice to meet you .
you too .
so , erm ... are you here in london for long?
marina told me that you're an actress .
no , no .
i have an audition in paris on monday .
i shouldn't say this , but with a very brilliant , very known italian director .
bertolucci , actually .
that's great .
yeah .
acting for cinema is not like theatre .
in the cinema , you must feel it .
not show emotion , just feel it .
and the camera sees it .
it's really wonderful .
which films have you done?
oh , mostly theatre at the moment .
is it nearly midnight?
holly ...
yeah?
oh .
listen , everyone .
isabel and i have got something to say .
we're getting married .
ohhh !
lucky devil !
felicitations , isabel !
holly , are you all right?
what's wrong , darling?
are you all right?
i think a great deal of champagne is called for here .
here .
it's bloody freezing .
put this on .
i'm fine , marina .
god , she's a nightmare , isn't she?
married?
god .
i mean , who gets married?
that's something out of the dark ages .
it's embarrassing .
it's pathetic .
i know .
it's weird .
and she's hilarious !
oh , god , how can he?
it's such a fucking clich .
you've still got me .
why?
who haven't i got?
holly , don't be like that .
i can't bear it when we're not us .
i don't know who i am when we're not us .
i don't know ever .
come on .
please .
for me .
it's nearly time !
oh , it's that time .
happy new year , holl .
you too .
come on .
let's go in .
come on .
smile .
come on . .. three , two , one !
happy new year !
i don't get it
# breaking away to the other side
# i wanna make sense of why we live and die
# i don't get it
# i don't get it
# i ask my friends if they understand
give me that .
right .
no , not yet .
how are we for vino?
do you prefer rouge , isabel?
non , a va , merci .
so , how are the pop videos , marina?
great .
you know ... superficial and meaningless .
and how did you two meet?
it's all been very mysterious .
at a bar mitzvah .
it was fate .
yes , it was fate .
holly rossman , right?
your father's sister's married to my cousin's brother .
leo .
leo muller .
thou shalt dance at bar mitzvahs , and not sit in a corner looking superior .
what are you doing for lunch tomorrow?
i've met this man , much too eligible for me he's a jewish doctor .
he's called leo .
dr leo muller .
hm?
where are you meeting him?
ok .
mm .
if she hadn't been walking past the restaurant ...
i can't bear to think about it .
no .
how about you two?
i met carl first didn't i?
it was at work , at some boring meeting .
wasn't it?
and then i introduced them .
it was like a jane austen novel .
which one?
emma .
so , you're a fight fan , then , carl?
yeah , and i spar a bit .
it's good to work off aggression .
a bit like therapy?
well , i'm in therapy , as well .
twice a week .
jungian .
i wonder if i need therapy .
leo?
well , it suits some people , but it's not for everyone .
what do you do?
he writes songs .
cool .
what have you done?
i'm selling stationery .
top of the range .
we've been living in the states .
it was better for my job .
i'm an actress .
cool .
i love la .
well , minneapolis , actually .
i was only in a soap , but , you know , quite interesting .
yeah , well , i bet you were great with the accent .
it's sexy .
oh , thank you .
how's it going over here?
well , i met mike leigh .
oh , i've heard of him .
yes , he's totally a genius .
and i'm in a new piece soon .
it's very political .
we can come to the premire yes !
yeah .
and you , holly?
oh ... still writing this bloody book ... thing .
it's been two years now .
can you believe it?
still the vampire thing?
yes , still the vampire thing .
it's how ... you know , each decade ...
it reinvents the vampire as a sexual icon .
it's not a book thing , holl .
it's a book .
mum sent us your articles .
they were great .
marvellous .
holly's the intellectual .
isn't she , marinie?
she's a journalist .
i do all right .
i'm always broke , though .
ah .
oh , hi .
i was er ... looking for a light .
it's weird being back here .
i know .
she's kept my room the same .
has she?
still smoking?
er ... no , i've just given up .
this career chitchat makes me feel a failure .
tell me about it .
it used to be hip to be on the dole .
i know !
what's happened?
i'm still waiting to transmute into a successful adult , instead of being a 12 year old .
i remember that 12 year old .
can i read your book , holl?
really?
no , no .
you'd ...
actually , would you?
yes .
who's this boxing prick?
he seems like one of marina's blokes .
it's nice to see you again .
yeah .
erm ... it's nice to see you .
there you are come on .
i want you downstairs .
i want , i want , i want , i want , i want !

who would i have?
look , marina .
i don't want a fight .
would you just stop nagging?
go and learn some hebrew .
bye .
jesus !
you two , you're like fucking siamese twins .
we're not .
how many times a day do you speak?
she's so controlling .
she wants you to get involved with that hopeless twat , so that you'll always need her .
and you let her .
blimey !
you could charge by the hour .
you know it all , suddenly .
she does it to me , too .
how does she do that?
well ... i think you know one way , holly .
he's not a hopeless twat , actually .
and he's not as superficial as he seems .
he just likes the surfaces of things ... and style can be stimulating , you know .
and he does a lot of work on himself .
and he's funny .
and my work is going well .
and i'm really happy , for once .
good .
great .
so , how's isabel?
holly .
holly .
strange feeling
look , holl ...
no .
no .

i used to watch you ... .. in your room .
i know .
i talk to you all the time in my head .
oh , god , i hate you .
# it happens every time
# i give you more than what i have
hold me .
# but now all i need is a little time
# oh , to sing this song , and i think we're gonna find
# a way to lose ...
holly , it's me again .
look , we've got to go to isabel's play on wednesday .
cow .
but it's for nat's sake .
ok , well , don't answer , then .
i'd better go .
it's getting late .
no , but ...
nat .
nat .
what are you doing here?
oh , i really wanted to see you , and say sorry .

nat , you should go .
yes , nat .
you should go .
yeah .

really nice seeing you again , mate .
darling , i'm sorry .
still , you didn't really like that script , anyway .
and you've got the play .
it's crap .
you know it is .
you're embarrassed for your friends to see it .
and natalie liron is in vogue .
it says , " she is a luminous , enigmatic , french beauty .
merde !
shh .
the water's freezing .
how long have you been lying there?
you're a prune .
come on .
there we go .
nat said isabel's play is bloody awful .
when did you see nat?
oh , no , i didn't .
we just spoke .
so , how's the hebrew coming?
are you really pleased for us?
yes .
oh , god .
how many times , already?
how much more pleased can i be?
i'm in a state of bliss .
all right .
you don't need my approval .
of course i do .
i want us all to be happy .
i know .
what about that one?
that goes .
honestly , this whole jewish thing ...
why shouldn't i be jewish?
huh?
it gives me a sense of identity .
really?
whose identity?
what did you say?
nothing .
what?
what did you just say just then?
oh , jesus .
come on .
i fucking introduced you , didn't i?
don't be so touchy .
it's christian of you .
what the fuck did you mean , holly?
nothing , all right?
i'm sorry .
god .
drop it .
we're having a nice time .
you don't have to make it into a big deal .
we were having a nice time , until you spoilt it .
why do you hate people being happy?
i don't .
you're just like your mother .
what do you mean?
just because things haven't worked out for you .
leave nat alone when he's contented .
nat?
what has nat got to do with it?
he's happy , and so am i.
i'm sorry you can't be pleased for us .
i just ... i don't ... i don't understand what ...
i don't know what i'm supposed to have ...
fuck it .
isabel?
hi , darling .
it's marina .

white horses
# on white horses let me ride away
# to my world of dreams so far away
# let me run
# to the sun
# to a world my heart can understand
# it's a gentle , warm and wonderland
# far away
# stars away
# where the clouds are made of candyfloss
# as the day is born
# when the stars are gone
# we'll race to meet the dawn
# so , when i can only see the grey
# of a sad and very lonely day
# that's when i
# softly sigh
# on white horses , snowy white horses , let me ride away
drawing rings around the world
# you expose the film in me
# we're drawing rings around the world
# sooner or later we will melt together
# and draw rings around the world
# with all those meteoric stones
# and all those sheep they never cloned
# ok
# i am glowing radioactive
# we draw rings around the world
# wish you could see us when we're at our best
# now we draw rings around the world
# with cans of post water in tow
# we're gonna vaporise your soul
# earth will become saturn ii
# with all those rings around the world
# tetsuo ii became me and you
# with all those rings around the world
# and all those body hammer blows
# drawing rings around the world
# ah ha
# ring ring , ring ring
# rings around the world
# ring ring , ring ring ...
