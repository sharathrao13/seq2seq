gromit !
owww !

well ...
that went as well as could be expected , didn't it?
though i might have to make a small adjustment to the drop .
a touch painful on re entry .
cracking toast , gromit .
any post , was there , perchance?
oh , dear , a bit steep !
oh , my goodness !
well , i'll be ... !
they're all bills .

i'm down to my last few coppers .

oh !
well , gromit , let's see what's on the 9 . 05 , shall we?
here she comes now .
i wonder what this can be .
happy birthday , chuck !
i knew you'd like it .
here , let me help you .
you look like somebody owns you now .
and that's only the first part !
come and look in here .
( whirr !
whirr ! )
i think you'll find this present a valuable addition to our modern lifestyle !
they're " techno trousers " .
ex nasa .
fantastic for walkies !
all you do is attach the lead on here ... then programme in .
walkies , ten minutes , twenty minutes ...
oops !
ha ha ha !
have a nice walk , gromit !
( whirr !
whirr !
whirr ! )
hmm ...
ohh ...
it's no use prevaricating about the bush .
yelp !
nice walkies , hmm?
how were the techno trousers?
oh .
there's someone at the door , gromit .
i wonder who that could be .
oh , it's about the room , then .
well , that's grand .
er , would you like to come this way and inspect?
i'm asking twenty a week .
that will include your breakfast .
i suppose you like kippers , do you?
partial to a nice black pudding myself .
with bacon , of course .
i'm sure that we could come to an amicable agreement .
as i say , it's a bit dingy at present , but it's surprising what a lick of paint'll do , isn't it?
oh !
er ...
but i don't think ...
hmm .
oh .
er , wasn't quite what we had in mind .
wouldn't you like to see ...?
oh , dear !
look ... um ...
there's something i've got to tell you .
it's , um ... no pets .
does that suit you?
oh ...
seems pleasant enough .
cheer up , gromit .
it's surprising what a lick of paint'll do , isn't it?
