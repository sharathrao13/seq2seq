wladek
you're wounded?
no , no , a little cut .
it's nothing .
i've been worried sick .
i told her not to worry .
you had your papers on you .
if you'd been hit by a bomb , they'd know where to take you .
henryk , don't
don't say things like that .
god forbid , god forbid .
papa , wladek's home .
what did i tell you?

they bombed us .
we're off the air .
warsaw's not the only radio station .

out ofwarsaw?
where?
you haven't heard?
heard what?
haven't you seen the paper?
no .
where's the paper?
i used it for packing .
she used it for packing !
the government's moved to lublin .
all able bodied men must leave the city , set up a new line of defense .
there's hardly anybody left in this building , only the women .
the men have gone .
what doyou thinkyou'll do while setting upyour new line of defense?
wander around lugging your suitcases?
pack , wladek .
i'm not going anywhere .
good .
i'm not going anywhere either .
don't be ridiculous .
we've got to keep together .
look , look .
if i'm going to die , i prefer to die in my own home .
i'm staying put .
god forbid .
i've got something .
listen .
received from the bbc in london .
the british government , having received no reply ... to the ultimatums presented to the german government , has declared war on nazi germany .
ho ho !
that's wonderful , wonderful !
it is expected
within the next few hours , france will make a similar declaration .
poland is no longer alone .
wonderful , wonderful !
mama , thatwas a great dinner .
yes , it certainly was .
when there's something to celebrate , you've got to make an effort .
here's to great britain and france .
i told you .
didn't i tell you?
all will be well !
oh !
five thousand and three .
huh?
is that all?
yes !
five thousand and three zlotys .
all we got left .
it's 3, 003 zlotys too much .
look .
jews will be allowed to keep a maximum of 2, 000 zlotys in their homes .
what are we supposed to do with the rest?
deposit it in a bank .
a blocked account .
banks?
who'd be stupid enough to deposit money in a german bank?
we could hide the money .
look here .
we can hide the money under the flowerpot .
no , we'll use tried and tested methods .
know what we did in the last war?
eh?
we made a hole in the table leg , and hid the money in there .
and suppose they take the table away?
what , take the table away?
the germans go into jewish homes and take what theywant .
furniture , valuables , anything .
idiot .
what would theywant with a table?
a table like this?
what on earth areyou doing?
listen .
look .
this is the bestplace .
no one will think oflooking underthe flowerpot .
no , no , no .
listen .
i've been thinking .
really?
that's a change .
you know what we do?
we use psychology .
we use what?
we leave the money and the watch on the table .
and we cover it , in full view .
are you stupid?
the germans will search high and low .
they'll never notice .
that's the stupidest thing i've ever seen .
of course they'll notice it .
look here .
idiot .
and you call me stupid .
that is very good .
this will take hours !
we're not in a hurry .
it won't take hours .
how will you get them out?
tell me that !
pull each one out individually !
no one listens to me .
quiet , please .
quiet !
order , order , please !
she's a lawyer , she likes order .
just listen !
the watch we put under the flowerpots and the money we stuff in the violin .
will i still be able to play?
well , you'll find out .
jurek?
it's wladek szpilman .
how are you?
fine , fine .
we're fine , thank you .
and you?
fine .
we're fine in the circumstances .
i guess what you called about there's nothing we can do .
theywon't reopen the station .
yes , i know .
but, jurek not even music .
nothing .
no radios for the poles .
jurek i'm sureyou'll find work , a pianist likeyou .
maybe , maybe not .
but
listen , don't be offended , but i didn't call to discuss my future career .
i nagged jurek forweeks and weeks .
at last he gave in and said , " all right , come with me tomorrow .
so i came , and they bombed the station .
meeting you like that was absolutelywonderful .
really? .
yes .
it was it was unforgettable .
i've always loved your playing , mr. szpilman .
call me wladek , please .
no one plays chopin likeyou .
i hope that's a compliment .
of course !
i mean it .
i know .
i was just trying to be funny .
shall we go to the paradiso , have a coffee? .
i'd like that .
and you? .
what doyou do? .
i finished at the conservatoire .
you're a musician !
yes .
what instrument i'm sorry .
what instrument? .
the cello .
oh .
i love to see a woman playing the cello .
here we are .
this is disgraceful !
how dare they !
you know what people are like .
theywant to be better nazis than hitler .
i'm going in there to complain .
no .
it's better not , believe me .
it's so humiliating , someone likeyou .
we'll find somewhere else .
we could walk in the park .
no , we can't .
it's an official decree .
nojews allowed in the park .
my god , areyou joking? .
i'm not joking .
i'd suggest we sit on the bench .
but it's another official decree .
nojews allowed on public benches .
this is absurd .
i'll tell you what we can do .
we can just stand here and talk .
i thinkwe're allowed to do that , don'tyou? .
soyou playthe cello , dorota .
that's nice .
and who's your favorite composer?
chopin?
really?
you'll have to learn to play his cello sonata , won't you?
and what aboutyou , wladek?? '
perhaps i can accompany you , me on the piano , you on the cello .
mr. szpilman , you are quite , quite wonderful .
call me wladek , please .
re . emblems forjews in the warsaw district .
i hereby order that all jews in the warsaw district ...
will wearvisible emblems when out of doors .
this decree will come into force on the 1 st of december , 1939 ,
and applies to all jews over 12 years ofage .
the emblem will be worn on the right sleeve ...
and will represent a blue star of david on a white background .
the background must be sufficiently large ...
for the star to measure eight centimeters from point to point .
the width of the arms of the star must be one centimeter .
jews who do not respect this decree will be severely punished .
governor of warsaw district ,
dr. fischer . '
i won't wear it .
i won't wear it .
i'm not going to be branded .
let let me see this .
doesn't it say we have to provide these armbands ourselves?
where will we get them?
we're not going to get them .
we're not going to wear them .
have you seen this?
what?
what?
i'm working .
what?
what is it?
it's where they're going to put us .
what do you mean , " put us "?
by order of the governor of the warsaw district , dr. fischer ,
concerning the establishment of the jewish district in warsaw .
there will be created a jewish district in which all jews ...
iiving in warsaw or moving towarsaw will have to reside . '
look here .
jews living outside ofthe prescribed area ... will have to move to thejewish district by 31st ofoctober , 1940 . '
theywon't get all of us .
it's too small .
there's 400, 000 of us in warsaw .
no .
360, 000 , so it'll be easy .
what am i supposed to do?
you tell me what i do now .
mama?
mama , what is it?
twenty zlotys .
that's all we have left , 20 zlotys .
what can i buy with 20 zlotys? .
i am sick of cooking potatoes , potatoes , potatoes .
that's the price .
that's what i'm offering .
my advice is to accept .
you won't get more from anyone else .
but it's a bechstein , mr. lipa .
2, 000 ... and my advice is to take it .
what areyou gonna do whenyou're hungry , eat the piano?
get out , you dirty bastard !
what's the matter with you? .
we'd rather give it away !
go on , get out !
haven'tyou eaten today?
what're you suffering from? .
you people are crazy .
i'm doing you a favor .
two thousand , and i'm paying for the removal .
i'm not even charging for the removal !
you haven't eaten today .
you're crazy .
take it .
dorota .
hi .
i didn't want to come .
i didn't want to see all this , but i i couldn't stop myself .
how are you doing?
fine .
good .
no , not really .
they arrested my cousin .
jurek says they'll let him out .
this is disgraceful .
it won't last long .
don't worry .
that's what i said , it's so
it's too absurd .
i , uh , i should
well , i'll i'll see you ... soon .
good bye .

i thought it would be worse .
where will we sleep? .
i'll sleep in the kitchen with the girls .

dostoyevsky , the idiot .
three zlotys .
it's better than yesterday .
three lousy zlotys .
and there are people here making millions .
i know .
you don't know , believe me .
they bribe the guards .
the guards turn a blind eye .
they're bringing in cartloads : food , tobacco , liquor , french cosmetics .
and the poor are dying all around them , they don't give a damn .
excuse me .
haveyou seen my husband , izaak szerman? .
a tall , handsome man with a little gray beard .
no? .
afraid not .
all right , excuse me .
good bye .
sleep well .
but , but if you see him , write to me .
yes?
izaak szerman .
why do we have to have a gentile street running through our area?
why can't they go around?
don't worry about it .
they're about to build a bridge .
haven't you heard?
a bridge? .
a bridge? .
a shmidge .
the germans claim to be intelligent .
you know what i think?
i think theyare totally stupid .
i have a family to feed .
i spend half my time here waiting for them to let us through .
why do they think i come here?
to listen to the music?
come .
come .
dance !
good , they're here .
yitzchak heller's been waiting for you .
what's this about?
sit down , have tea .
i'll start lunch when the girls get back .
so , what are you doing here?
he brought cakes .
his father's back in the jewellery business .
he's doing well , eh?
amazing .
jewellery .
we're recruiting .
who's recruiting? .
don't be cleverwith me .
i've come here as a friend .
they're bringingjews in from all overthe country .
soon there'll be a half million people in the ghetto .
we need more jewish police .
oh !
more jewish police .
you mean you want me to beat upjews with my truncheon and catch the gestapo spirit .
i see !
somebody's got to do it , henryk .
but whyme?
i thoughtyou only recruited boys with rich fathers .
look at my father .

what about you , wladek?
you're a great pianist .
and we've got an excellent police jazz band .
they'd welcome you with open arms .

you've got no work .
thank you .
i've got work .
right .
yes , of course .
i'm sorry , wladek , he wants you to stop .
who wants me to stop?
i always say , look on the bright side !
you're in the small ghetto .
intellectuals , professional people .
you're better off than us .
here in the large ghetto , it's a cesspool .
jehuda , give me something to do .
you're an artist .
you keep people's spirits up .
you do enough .
but i want to help .
i want to do something .
you're too well known .
and you know what?
you musicians don't make good conspirators .
you're too ... too ... musical !
what was that?
symche .
majorek .
there are notices going up .
the city's to be cleansed of undesirables .
there are always notices going up .
hello , symche .
dolek .
mrs. zyskind .
jehuda , working hard?
majorek , this is the greatest pianist in poland , maybe the whole world .
wladyslaw szpilman .
meet majorek .
i know your name .
i've never heard you play .
majorek used to be in the army .
brilliant man .
the onlything i've got against him is he's not a socialist .
you better go now , wladek .
it's nearly curfew .
you know how many copies we print of our newspaper?
five hundred .
you know how many people on average read one copy?
twenty .
that makes 10, 000 readers .
these will start the uprising .
majorek hides them in his underpants , and leaves them in toilets .
toilets , huh?
as many toilets as i can find .
germans never use jewish toilets .
they're too clean for them .
please .
please , help , sir .
stop it !

c'mon , c'mon , c'mon .
come on , boy .
stand up .
stand up !
stand up !
stand up .
stand up .
and , please , tonight , for once , i don't want anything bad talked about .
enjoy our meal .
fine .
then i'll tell you something funny .
do you all know who i mean by dr. raszeja?
the surgeon?
the surgeon .
for some reason don't ask me why the germans allowed him into the ghetto to perform an operation .
on a jew?
they allowed a pole to come in to operate on a jew?
he got a pass .
that's all i know .
anyway .
he puts the patient to sleep and starts the operation .
he's just made the first incision when the ss burst in , shoot the patient on the table , then shoot dr. raszeja and everybody else who was there .
isn't that a laugh?
the patient didn't feel a thing , he was anesthetized .
i said nothing bad , henryk .
what's the matterwith you all?
huh?
huh?
you lost your sense of humor?
it's not funny .
you know what's funny?
you're funnywith that ridiculous tie .
what areyou talking about my tie for?
what does my tie have to do with anything?
i need this tie for my work .
your work?
that's right , i work .
yes .
playing the piano for the parasites in the ghetto .
parasites .
boys .
boys !
they don't give a damn about people suffering .
you blame me for their apathy .
i do .
i see it every day .
they don't even notice what's going on around them .
i blame the americans .
forwhat? .
for my tie? .
american jews , and there are lots of'em .
what have they done for us? .
what do they think they're doing? .
people here are dying , haven't got a bite to eat .
the jewish bankers there should be persuading america to declare war on germany .
lights , lights !
you !
up !
shh , mama .
what?
oh , my god .
shh .
oh , my god .
excuse me .

i'll take care ofit .
excuse me .
have you seen my husband , izaak szerman?
i'm afraid not .
he's tall , handsome , a little gray beard .
ifyou see him , write to me .
don't forget .
izaak szerman .
what happened here?
they've got my grandson .
they pick him up .
they take him away .
what do they do to them?
i've stopped believing in god .
excuse me .
excuse me .
yitzchak?
yitzchak .
wladek szpilman .
henryk's in there .
i haven't seen him .
believe me , they've picked him up .
tough luck .
can you help? .
ha !
now you need me .
yes , now you need me .
can you help us? .
it costs .
i've no money .
then there's nothing i can do .
you should've joined us when you had the chance .
yitzchak , they told meyou had influence .

a snatcher !
a snatcher !

why'd they pick you up?
so you go to yitzchak heller .
did i ask you to talk to him?
you're out , aren't you?
did you beg?
did you grovel to that piece of shit?
no , i asked him to help you .
what did you pay him?
with what could i pay him?
with what?
every zloty i earn we spend on food .
i can look after myself .
they were taking you away .
it's got nothing to do with you !
it's me theywanted , not you .
why do you have to interfere with other people's business? .
you're mad .
that's your trouble , is you're mad .
that's also my business .
hold it .
what's the matter?
what's the matter?
are you sick?
hungry .
employment certificate?
what's that mean , no employment certificate?
you have to have an employment certificate ... to work for one of the german firms in the ghetto , otherwise
otherwise , what? .
you will be deported .
so the rumors are true .
they're going to resettle us .
send us to labor camps in the east .
and they're closing the small ghetto .
my god .
wladek?
wladek?
i thought you'd be off on tour playing london , paris , new york , chicago .
not this week .
you look terrible .
haveyou heard the rumors?
they're going to resettle us in the east .
rumors !
you take it all too much to heart .
what's the trouble?
i've been trying to get the certificate of employment for my father .
i've managed to get one for me and the rest of my family .
but i need another one for my father .
i've been to all the firms and shops .
why didn'tyou come to me?
i didn't knowyou were in the certificate business .
i'm not , but majorek is .
can you help?
i have no money .
please , don't insult us .
can you do something for him?
be at the schultz workshop tomorrow , 4 : 00 .
see what a wonderful piece of luck you've had today?
that's the historical imperative in action .
that's why i always say , look on the bright side .
the bright side .
yes , i know .
how's your back?
better .
better?
better than last week .
thank you .
my pleasure .
it won't help you anyway !
thank you , mr. schultz .
well , at least we got work in the ghetto .
at least we're still together .
du .
du .
du .
du .
du .
du .
i'm sorry .
i did my best .
i thought the certificates would save us .
stop it , wladek !
let's just hope that henryk and halina will be better off .
where will we be going?
you're going to work .
you'll be much better off than in this stinking ghetto .
move .
why did i do it?
why did i do it , huh?
why did i do it?
why did i do it?
why did i do it?
why did i do it?
why did i do it?
why did i do it?
why did i do it?
why did i do it?
don't you have a drop of water?
he's dying .
my child's dying of thirst .
no .
i'm sorry .
i beg you .
i beg you .
don't you have a drop of water?
i beg you .
can you hear what i'm saying?
i'm telling you it's a disgrace !
i can hear you !
we let them take us to our death like sheep to the slaughter .
not so loud .
why don't we attack them?
there's half a million of us here .
we could break out of the ghetto .
at least we could die honorably , not as a stain on the face of history .
why areyou so sure they're sending us to our death?
i'm not sure !
you know why i'm not sure?
because they didn't tell me .
they're gonna wipe us all out .
what do you want me to do?
do you want me to fight?
to fight you need organization
he's right .
what doyou think i can do , fight them with my violin bow?
the germans will never squander a huge labor force like this .
they're sendi ng us to a labor camp .
i t's obvious .
oh , sure !
look at that cripple there .
look at the old people , the children .
they're gonna work?
look at you?
you gonna carry iron girders on your back?
henryk !
halina !
henryk !
halina !

we wanted to be with you .
we wanted to be with you .
stupid , stupid .
why did i do it?
why did i do it?
she's getting on my nerves .
what did she do , for god's sake?
she smothered her baby .
they prepared a hiding place , so , of course , they went there .
but the baby cried just as the police came .
she smothered the cries with her hands .
the baby died .
a policeman heard the death rattle , found where they were hiding .
mama .
what are you reading?
if you prick us , do we not bleed?
if you tickle us , do we not laugh?
if you poison us , do we not die?
and if you wrong us , shall we not revenge?? '
very appropriate .
yes , that's why i brought it .
idiot .
what's he think he's going to do with the money?
hey , boy?

i'd like to talk to her .
don't forget , they hang them for helping jews .
achtung !
how long have you been here?
since last night .
i was pleased to see you .
they're going to start a final resettlement now .
we know what it means .
we sent someone out zygmunt .
a good man .
his orders were to follow the trains out of warsaw .
he got to sokolow .
a local railway man told him the tracks divided , one branch leading to treblinka .
he said every day freight trains carrying people from warsaw ... branched offto treblinka and returned empty .
no transports offood are everseen on that line .
and civilians ... are forbidden to approach the treblinka station .
they're exterm i nati ng us .
it won't take them long .
we're 60, 000 left out ofhalfa million .
mostly young people .
and this time we're gonna fight .
we're in good shape , organized .
we're prepared .
if you need help , i
