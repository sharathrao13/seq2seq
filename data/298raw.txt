being a policeman is not what you see on tv .
i've never had to pick between the red and blue wires .
never seen a police car flip and cause other cars to burst into flames .
never had to jump across rooftops .
i investigate crimes , track leads ... ... and sit in court .
it's difficult , tedious work , and you won't get rich .
but i've done it for 28 years .
i'm a detective .
that's what i do .
if you break the law ... ... l'll do all i can to hunt you down and put you behind bars .
i won't say that i succeed every time .
but i try to make sure that if you do the crime , you'll do time .
any questions?
well , detective preston , why don't you tell us about ... ... the lighter side of police work?
you know .
the fun days .
i chased him over three roofs .
you can't do this !
it's from the mayor .
you're a loose cannon .
you destroyed a city block !
he fired first .
i should read him his rights?
you should've called for backup .
my only backup is in a hospital bed !
his doctor called five minutes ago .
jimmy didn't make it .
oh , god .
oh , god , no .
no !
he was talking about getting out .
it's hard .
he was like a brother to me , captain .
since we was kids , we was partners .
we used to hang out ... ... and dream about being on the force together .
that was the dream .
just two little irish boys ... ... fighting , scrapping , thinking about making a difference .
god , i'm gonna miss him !
i'll need your gun and your shield , pete .
i may be off the force , but i am not off this case !
that's not in the script .
i just threw that in at the end .
i thought i should get the last line .
nailed it !
trey , it was great .
very believable .
but i'm not married to it .
you can't fix perfect .
we have imaginations .
thanks .

give us some information , something .
have a statement?
don't break the police tape .
we have a right  to keep on the other side .
aren't you the cop who got busted with his own cuffs?
think an officer doing his job is funny?
let's see how funny it is when i move this tape back 20 feet .
he'll be a " bloopers " classic .
get b roll .
come over the tape , you'll get b roll of me kicking your ass down to sunset .
detective preston !
detective preston !
why did you shoot the camera?
are you a loose cannon?
what happened?
give me all you got .
brad?
hi , chase .
go .
i have the show to pull your network from the ratings toilet .
you can do public executions?
meet mitch preston .
you know i don't read .
look at the pictures .
annie .
get that f *** ing thing out of here !
what was that?
detective preston destroys maxis tv camera .
that's ours .
" rogue cop guns down camera .
we can sue .
exactly .
he's dirty harry , he's real and we've got him by the balls .
i see where you're going with this .
a reality show .
how is it different than " cops "?
did you see?
he's a modern day cowboy .
he's sexy , volatile .
he's a bad boy , and women love bad boys .
he could frisk me .
you like getting frisked?
brad , focus .
want to see it again in slow motion?
i get the point .
shit !
what?
i was outbid for an " a team " lunch box .
okay , brad .
so we've got this mitch preston?
we're with him 24 hours a day .
because he's gonna blow again , and when he does , we'll be there .
if he makes a lot of arrests , he gets a prize?
who gets the prize?
this isn't a game show .
this is one man , on his own , kicking ass and taking names .
can we give him a partner?
that's a good idea .
we'll give him a funny minority type .
that'll get the naacp off my back .
or is it the ncaa?
do we have a deal?
fine , go make a pilot .
no , brad .
this guy isn't a pilot , he's a series .
trust me .
i'll stake my entire reputation on it .
what reputation?
you still get shit for faking the flammable pajama story .
you can't tell me that wasn't good tv .
are you in or out?
i'm pitching this at fox in half an hour .
i'll give a six episode commitment .
yes !
but if it's all pit stops at krispy kreme , i'm pulling the plug ...
... and you're out of a job .
we'll all be out of a job .
what do they teach you in china?
let's go .
bring it on .
you rocked !
we're screwed .
we know nothing about these shows .
there are rules .
call l. a. p. d. and get clearances .
and find a cameraman .
ls julio out of traction?
i'll call the hospital .
what if our dirty harry says no?
everybody wants to be on tv .
10 36 .
it looks like the stolen cuffs were an inside job .
that's very funny , guys .
very funny .
very well written .
what are you reading , the jenny craig newsletter?
fyl , my friend , a lot of this is muscle .
it's a flyer for some new reality tv cop show .
i got to be part of this .
thought you wanted to be a detective .
i'm a cop and i'm a professional actor .
your career consists of a few lines on an episode of " diagnosis murder .
all i need is the right part and i'll get my big break .
know how old sam jackson was when he got his break?
he was 42 .
okay , but he's got , gosh , what's that thing called?
talent .
i'm talented .
i ain't no sam jackson , but i'm talented .
your partner will be mitch preston .
we know who'd wear the cuffs there .
he nailed the other lead?
he's front page news .
everybody's talking about him .
i'd blow his old ass off the screen every night .
you crazy?
mitch preston , please !
i said , " do you wanna take your feet off the desk?
get your feet off the desk .
where's lazy boy?
my client's taking the fifth .
he's the victim here .
got yourself a pricey lawyer .
had to sell a lot of tvs for that .
who's paying?
that's privileged information .
the captain needs to see you when you're done .
he's done .
come on , rerun .
this interview is over .
we don't talk , we walk .
for now .
do you want me to start filming?
yeah , everything you see .
perfect .
oh , my god .
this place is so depressing .
it looks like a tomb .
well , you wanted reality .
we need a reality change .
this is hideous .
i'm not doing it .
let them follow somebody else .
they don't want anyone else .
you the man of the hour .
all i did was shoot a video camera .
you made us look like savages .
the network is suing for $10 million .
what?
they said you could have killed their cameraman .
maybe i should have killed him .
the chief already cut the deal .
do the show , and they drop the suit .
what?
that's extortion !
they can't do that .
we need good pr .
community relations are in the toilet .
you the best detective we got .
so , what about this big gun?
am i supposed to let them follow me around while i track down the weapon?
look , i did an episode of " cops " once .
you did an episode of " cops "?
you forget the camera is even there .
this is real work .
i'm not an actor .
no one is saying you can't work .
but you screwed up .
and now you've got to play ball .
end of story .
you'll be reporting to the show's producer , chase renzi .
chase renzi?
is that a real name?
i won't take orders from some coked out hollywood dickhead .
not in a million years .
that i won't do .
that's good , because she doesn't have a dick .
check her out for yourself .
she's outside , waiting for you .
well .
better looking than i thought .
we gotta bring in color , some light .
do you think these windows move?
detective preston , hi .
i can see you're busy .
we'll talk tomorrow .
he's not very friendly .
find out where he eats .
make a reservation for two .
here you go , cover boy .
thanks .
detective preston , chase renzi .
it's a pleasure to meet you .
how you doing?
good .
i see you've already ordered .
make it quick , i have work to do .
what can i get you?
same as him .
a cheeseburger , rare , fries and a coke .
diet?
regular .
so , detective preston ....
can i call you mitch?
why don't i just launch into a few basic questions ...
... and find out what makes you tick .
i don't tick .
sure you do .
everybody ticks .
not me .
tell me about yourself .
you have a girlfriend , a wife?
ex wife .
ex wife .
was it a painful divorce?
i only ask because i was divorced , and i know it can be difficult .
i mean , did you drink?
lady , i'm here because my captain made me .
i had no choice .
i have no interest in you , your questions or your show .
not only do i understand your resistance , i appreciate it .
you do , huh?
good .
i'm not into making the same bullshit cop show we've seen a million times .
that's why i believe if we're honest and open with each other ... ... we could do something very special here .
i don't know what you're talking about .
i'm talking about reality , mitch .
there you go .
letting the world find out who you really are .
you're looking for loose cannon , cop on the edge " serpico " bullshit .
i'm telling you , you're wasting your time .
see that anger , mitch?
it's working for you .
the audience will connect with that in a major way .
i'm out of here .
i'll call you later to discuss your new partner .
want that in a doggy bag?
no .
thanks , though .
it was delicious .
how did it go?
is he intense?
i need cherry tums , quick .
ls he psyched about the show?
it may be harder than i thought .
hey !
you son of a bitch !
freeze !
l. a. p. d. !
wait !
wait !
bad idea .
i only got two things bigger than my mouth .
one of them is pointed at your head .
you want to do this the hard way?
i'll stick you , pig !
okay , officer .
you nice with yours .
you damn right .
if your boys want to know who put the smack down on you , my badge is 38723 .
i go by the name of trey sellars , patrolman .
i believe this belongs to you , ma'am .
chase renzi .
that was incredible .
just doing my job , like the badge says , protecting and serving .
get this psycho off me !
what's with the superfly shit?
i got the situation in hand .
top cop , how you doing?
this is my collar .
never leave a suspect who's not cuffed .
he could've had a gun .
nobody got no gun .
trey , i think you broke a rib .
tell him to get the cuffs off .
i told you i can't do handcuffs .
quiet !
you have the right to remain silent !
you know each other?
no .
never seen him before .
just another criminal .
bullshit .
we took a stage combat class together last fall .
nice try , pal .
he's just trying to weasel his way out of the crime .
that's what he's doing .
he looks like a real menace .
who wants to explain?
trey said he'd give me $50 if i snatched the lady's purse and ran .
he'd pull up in his police car , jump out ... ... chase me up a fence , beat me down , kick me
all right , all right .
okay .
i set the whole thing up .
it was a big setup .
i set it up to make it look like i was ....
i was auditioning to get this part .
what part?
your partner .
we've been interviewing .
it won't be this moron .
i should report you for impersonating a cop .
put a lock on that " moron " shit .
why you take everything so seriously?
you should be protecting , not staging crimes .
someone could've got hurt .
like me .
i'm learning from a guy who shot a news camera?
you got the part already .
i'm just trying to spruce it up .
that's what you normally do at work .
better watch your mouth .
what are you gonna do , wrap me up in caution tape?
no , i ain't gonna wrap you up in caution tape .
but i'll tell you , punk , i might whip your ass up and down the parking lot .
work on your " starsky and hutch " routine on your own time .
you better walk off .
i was getting ready to slap you .
he's a disgrace .
you'd work with him?
never in a million years .
i think we have good chemistry .
riveting .
amazing .
really?
thank you .
all right .
the guy's a joke .
there's no way i'll work with him .
i don't want to hear it .
shit , come on .
thanks .
you're doing this .
that's an order .
trapped in the jaws , he struggled .
you'll never see no brothers messing with no sharks .
never .
hello?
i saw you on tv , shooting up the neighborhood .
what's going on , vargas?
i was trying to call you , dog .
oh , yeah?
i got cell phones , call waiting , e mail , voice mail ... ... and i haven't heard " una chingada " from you .
it ain't like that , dog .
i laying low till everything dies down .
it got crazy .
and did i say you could use my gun?
you know , lazy boy , i trusted you .
and you let me down .
and now you put my entire shipment at risk .
you used that gun without my permission .
we don't want that getting into the wrong hands , do we now?
no , i was just borrowing it .
just testing it out , you know?
and how did it work?
real good .
i got it right here .

why should i?
i'm patrolling .
you're happy because you're patrolling .
keeping it safe , mitch .
patrolling every friday at night .
every friday night at 8 .
this guy is the worst actor i have ever seen .
get out .
wait a minute , hold it , cut , cut .
mitch , you can't just toss a cameraman aside .
give me a pad , i'll show you how a tv cop comes through the door .
the doors fly open .
they fly open .
you burst in .
you scan the room .
you do the turn , toss yourself around .
and now !
you're set and
but don't turn your head too far from camera .
that little lady is your lover .
don't respect her , she won't respect you .
always know where she is .
she's in my way .
what's wrong?
you're getting tips from t. j. hooker .
which is the most underrated show in history .
nobody came through a door like you .
thank you .
this guy is no detective .
i'm playing a detective .
i'm playing detective .
all right , guys .
i'm playing a detective .
okay .
let's go do some hood jumping .
what's that?
what do you think?
we jump over hoods .
something you'd know .
freeze !
that was great , trey .
beautiful .
that was really great .
okay , mitch .
come here .
i'm not going on the hood of a car .
what do you mean?
forget it .
i entertained viewers everywhere in the '80s , jumping on car hoods .
one of a tv cop's greatest weapons .
i'll show you .
you gotta stop them , see?
halt !
and you throw your body .
halt !
you okay , t. j.?
moving on .
who stole the money?
deep in thought .
now the eyebrows arch , ever so slightly .
and hooker solves another case .
okay?
all right , trey , you try it .
go ahead .
ready?
get loose now .
loosen up .
ready?
yeah .
trey , who stole the money?
good .
you nailed it , first take .
give me five .
that was good !
okay , mitch .
come on , show me some magic .
mitch , who stole the money?
look at that , trey .
look .
look at the anger in his eyes .
look at that .
see that slight squint says , " hey , i'm mitch .
i'm the man .
don't mess with me .
okay .
let's taste some drugs .
hooker's got a bag of white powder in his hand .
spears it open with a pocketknife .
takes his little pinkie ... ... in the powder .
and he touches it , gently , on his tongue .
watch the eyebrows .
hooker knows it's cocaine .
what if it's cyanide?
hello?
hold on .
there's a reason real cops don't taste drugs , bill .
it's never cyanide .
show me the thing with your eyebrow .
okay , i'm on my way .
it's tricky .
where are you going?
i gotta wash this shit out of my hair .
we have some action?
we have some action , finally .
beep , beep !
hey , mitch .
what'd you do to my car?
we added micro cameras .
in the wheel , the glove compartment and a crook cam in the back .
pretend they're not there .
pretend .
see?
you're catching on already .
we'll be right behind you in the van .
you'll be right behind me?
what are you doing?
i'm on the case .
i'm your partner .
we're together .
unbelievable .
what's the mean face for?
listen .
don't speak , listen .
there's a few things i need to tell you .
first of all , you gotta know that i got your back covered ... ... and i gotta know you got mine covered .
no doubt .
when we're on the job you're the only person i can depend on .
not friends , family , not anybody , just you .
you got that?
that's important .
there's no other way .
and it's gotta start right now .
you know , ever since i was 8 , i wanted to be a cop .
i wanted to be on the force like uncle reggie .
he was the first in the family on the force .
big muscles .
uncle reggie .
he used to let me ride in the squad car with him .
once he let me play with the siren .
from then on ... ... i knew i was gonna be a cop .
uncle reggie .
yeah .
my uncle
uncle reggie passed away two years ago .
he got caught in the line of some fire .
didn't slow me down .
i remember how he set me on my way .
he's looking down on me from a big precinct in the sky .
he's thinking , " you've done all right , trey .
you've done right by me .
what does that got to do with anything?
you got a speech , so i get a speech .
that wasn't a speech .
that " i'm your partner .
that was a speech .
you burned up 90 seconds of air .
that was a speech .
when we get to the crime scene , stay out of my way .
this isn't studio shit .
this is real .
get your camera out of here .
hey , watch it .
julio has to shoot .
that's the show .
he's done " jerry springer .
that's right .
whatever you need , i'm there .
if i get shot , stabbed , it's cool .
whatever .
i'm getting good footage .
go to trey .
i'm trey .
julio .
you worked on springer?
springer , girls gone wild .
get that camera out of here .
who's in the bag?
we don't know yet .
whoever shot him didn't care for open caskets .
thinking what i'm thinking?
i seriously doubt it .
i'm thinking there's dirty cops on the streets ... ... cleaning the streets up on they own terms , partner .
this is payback for a drug deal gone sour .
whoever this guy worked for got pissed .
even better .
this is a bad guy retribution scenario .
good thinking , partner .
good thinking .
i think i can identify one of the victims .
those are 12 gauge , armor piercing uranium shells .
charlie .
hey , mitchell .
i found explosive and incendiary rounds scattered around .
the same gun that put holes in your tv repair shop .
it appears to be hand held , automatic , with interchangeable magazines .
technically , this gun doesn't exist .
what do you mean?
this gun is like the 50 foot shark .
speak english .
it's out there , but nobody's ever seen it .
any idea who made it?
it's a custom job .
my guess is , it's out of eastern europe .
thanks , charlie .
keep your eyes open .
you bet .
what are you doing?
take it easy .
you're not supposed to touch .
i didn't .
i turned it over .
let me know when you touch  i don't have to
what's going on?
he's contaminating my crime scene .
i'm doing a sweep of the area .
you never know where a crucial bit of evidence may be hiding .
like this , for instance .
did anybody think to pull some prints off this water bottle?
can i get an evidence bag?
put down my water .
i'm not finished drinking it .
that's an honest mistake .
you got your water amongst potential evidence so i thought it was ....
hey , t. j. , go solve the case somewhere else .
don't give me orders , i'm your partner !
no , you're not , i partner with real cops .
get me a copy of that report .
all right , mitch .
well , i am your partner , so you better accept that .
i am your partner !
he won't open up .
you know how hard it is to work with somebody like that?
i know .
mitch has been a lot more resistant than i'd hoped for .
i think that you and mitch need some bonding time .
you're right .
we do .
we need some qt time together .
two guys hanging out , have some beers .
i'll call to see if he wants to hang out .
let's not call him .
let's just go over .
just show up?
surprise him .
what are you doing?
how hard is it to say , " hi , trey , nice to see you "?
hi , trey .
what are you doing here?
we got off on the wrong foot .
i got some food .
we can eat the food and bond a bit .
bond?
yeah .
how'd you get my address?
hi , mitch .
oh , shit .
yeah .
i gave it to him .
will you invite us in?
don't be rude .
do i have to?
you got us out in the hall like a jehovah's witness .
i gotta see where my star cop lives .
come on , mitch .
oh , my god .
mitch ... !
nice .
got a little smell to it .
not a stinky smell , an odd one .
what is that smell?
is this here your actual living area?
this is my batcave .
a tunnel in the garage leads to my mansion .
what's the problem?
research tells us buddy cops live in visually distinctive places .
like a trailer on the beach or a loft downtown .
that kind of thing .
your research shows that , huh?
where does he live?
i rent a guesthouse from a producer .
kind of gives off a " magnum " vibe .
totally .
it's unique .
you know what , mitch?
we can make this work .
did a crackhead make this cup?
it's not visually exciting enough?
no .
it's just
the point is to let the audience in on all aspects of your life .
they want to spend time in a place that speaks to your personality .
this does speak to my personality .
mitch , i think you need some time away from the job .
i just found the crackhead's shop .
hey , don't go in there .
this is what you smell all over the place .
wow , a pottery studio !
you're full of surprises .
how long you been doing this?
six years , give or take .
you really got a knack for it .
this room's off limits .
it's not for show .
okay , mitch .
we haven't done any bonding at all yet .
bond with yourself , i got work to do .
hey !
check this out .
must be some hollywood dickhead .
not bad , huh?
a cop never slides across the hood .
why?
it's not police procedure?
your holster scratches the paint .

i think it captures the reality of an inner city precinct .
is this where you do the makeup?
no .
this is good .
you have to see it .
mitch , you have to see this .
look at your desk .
it's so beautiful .
ls this my desk?
that's your desk .
and that's yours , mitch .
we didn't change it .
but this is a confessional .
all right?
talk about anything you want .
you can talk about the job , each other ... ... your sex lives .
i mean , only if you want to .
direct to camera .
no , thanks .
you could put a pottery wheel there .
look , mitch , this is an integral part of the show .
you're obligated to spend five minutes a day in here .
we've provided a chair .
all you have to do is sit and share .
share?
learn how to turn on your heart light .
exactly .
chase !
brad loves the promo footage .
but they need a catch phrase .
i got one .
i wish i was dead .
you need a catch phrase?
i got it .
when i'm about to make a bust  when did you ever make a bust?
don't tell me .
when i'm about to make a bust , to get in the moment ... ... i take three deep breaths and say to myself , " okay , trey , it's showtime !
you say that?
that's stupid .
what's stupid about it?
know what?
don't say it , please .
no , i have to say it , mitch .
showtime . " it's amazing .
that could be the name of our show !
see?
it's not stupid .
it's perfect .
say it again for the camera .
do it again with the breathing .
my god , you're a natural .
it's showtime !
this is harley barley taking calls from fans of the new series " showtime " .

i'm gonna be honest , you know .
it's natural , when you're in a situation that's shitty ... ... to think about what it might be like to have a different partner .
like somebody that was closer to your age .
charismatic , with a little flair and shit .
you kicking it with him , have some fun .
me and a wesley snipes type .
i know you won't get wesley .
i see wesley snipes types all the time .
me and a wesley snipes type?
can you imagine?
wesley snipes type?
do you feel lucky , punk?
huh?

... so mitch can keep up .
because i'm working out .
i do free weights .
go ahead .
make my day .
i'm taking care of mine .
