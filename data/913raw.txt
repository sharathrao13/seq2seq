i think that's it .
once i heard the sound of the laughter of children .
and i wept warm , salty tears for the lost trees .
let the little children come unto the trees ... and i will give them hope , " he said .
but there are no trees for the poor , lost , poor children .
decay is their toy .
despair is their game .
they have only chaos to climb .

that's at the beach .
we always bought these little hats .
and this is kindergarten .
mm .
oh , and , uh , these are my brothers and sisters .
oh .
my dad's a writer .
they live in connecticut .

hmm .
that's colette ...
colette .

very strong opinions .
in fact , you and my father ...
you couldn't get two people more different .
yeah , you'd hate each other .
why?
well , you're so right wing about everything .
