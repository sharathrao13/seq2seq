pilot .
pilot !
you must wake up !
what?
konnichi wa , anjin .
you must greet him .
say konnichi wa and bow .
konnichi wa , omi .
you must say omi san .
why?
san means " honorable .
it is an insult if you leave it off .
say it quickly and bow .
konnichi wa , omi san .
you must get dressed , quickly .
konnichi wa .
konnichi wa .
is she his wife?
wife?
no .
who is she?
the woman is a harlot ... common whore , and damned for all eternity .
a slave ship .
you can't stop now , not if you want to live .
come , pilot .
anjin .
anjin san .
anjin san .
hai , omi san .
no , i'm not going on a slaver .
damn slave ship , and i won't set foot on it !
it's a god cursed slaver , and you'll never make me go on board !
leave him alone .
did he hear what i said?
leave him alone !
is he the pilot , the anjin , ka?
you the pilot of the dutchman?
aye , i'm the pilot .
who are you?
good , good .
i'm vasco rodrigues , pilot of this galley , at least on this miserable trip .
rotten to hell ...
that's better .
listen , pilot , that man is like a king .
i told him that i'd be responsible for you , and that i'd as soon blow your damned head off as drink with you .
now bow to the bloody sama .
you do that like a jappo .
you really the pilot?
aye .
what's the latitude of the lizard?
49 degrees , 56 minutes north , and watch out for the reefs , and bear south by southwest .
you're the pilot , by god .
come aboard .
there's food and grog and all pilots should love all pilots .
amen .
right?
right , but where are you taking me?
osaka .
the great lord high executioner himself wants to see you .
who?
toranaga , lord of the eight provinces , whatever the hell they may be .
he's the chief daimyo over this whole bloody country .
what does he want with me?
well , how the hell would i know?
but if he wants to see you , by god , he'll see you .
now , give him a nice little jappo bow , and on you go .
do it , ingeles .
ship's confiscated , ingeles .
confiscated?
what about my crew?
oh , they'll be all right .
listen , there's nothing that you or me can do about it now .
you'll just have to wait and see what happens .
you'll never tell with the jappos .
they're all six faced and three hearted .
hey ... madonna , she looks fast , your ship .
where was she built , rotterdam?
aye .
do you think we could go aboard her?
i'd like to collect my gear , and you could have a closer look .
i'll blow your head off , ingeles , if you've got some damn trick up your sleeve .
i give you my word , pilot to pilot ... and i'll swear on your mother's virtue .
i'm beginning to like you , ingeles .
hey !
ima !
ima , it is .
ima means " now , at once .
we're to leave at once .
please ask him if i can go aboard my ship .
no , ingeles , i won't ask him a poxy thing .
i have your word?
you have it .
come on .
there's a boat down there , ingeles .
move fast ... ... don't look around , and don't listen to anybody but me ... go .
don't worry , captain san , i am responsible !
me !
sit there .
not to worry , captain san .
you get ship ready .
watch them carefully , ingeles .
tell me what they're doing .
the bowmen are taking out arrows .
madonna , they're too cursed accurate with those things .
are they getting ready to shoot?
yes , they ... no , wait a minute , they're ... the captain's talking to them .
damn all samurai , anyway .
why?
they love to kill , ingeles .
they even sleep with their swords .
and they fear nothing , least of all , death .
if a samurai's lord says " kill , " he kills .
their lord says , " die , " he'd slit his own belly open just like that .
i saw omi san kill a man in the village just because the man didn't bow .
and you'd better remember that , ingeles .
the samurai rule everything here .
they have the right to kill anyone who isn't a samurai whenever they feel like it .
man , woman , or child , it doesn't matter .
they all serve their master .
that's what the word means , ingeles .
samurai means " to serve .
and if you forget your bloody manners , they'll serve your head up for you .
i didn't see you bow and scrape .
that's because i'm me , rodrigo san .
i am important because i act important .
they understand that .
here you don't ask , you act .
of course , sometimes you get killed if you act wrong .
right .
konnichi wa ... to all sod eating samas .
bow like i did .
right .
let's go and get your gear .
kinjiru , eh?
well , not for me , it isn't bloody kinjiru .
i am rodrigo san .
ichi ban bloody pilot to toda hiro matsu sama .
toda hiro matsu sama , ka?
well , i'm from toda hiro matsu sama , who's a bigger king than your bugger , and toda sama's from toranaga sama , who's the biggest bugger in this whole world .
neh?
get ready to abandon ship .
toranaga sama !
toranaga sama !
hai .
that's bloody well better .
those sons of plague infested lice !
they've taken everything !
god curse all jappos .
well , since there's nothing here , why don't you take a look at the ship?
where are they , ingeles?
what?
your rutters , your charts .
you've hidden them somewhere .
well , that's why you wanted to come on board .
no pilot would worry about clothes .
you came for your rutters , and now you want me to get out of here so that you can get them .
you're right .
that's why i wanted to come ... but they were in here .
oh , i don't want to steal them , ingeles .
i just want to read them , maybe copy a part or two .
they were in the sea chest .
oh , madonna , what a liar !
you wouldn't have left them in there .
now , come on , we haven't got much time .
look , i took your word , now you take mine , pilot to pilot .
i won't steal them .
damn !
stolen !
what? !
do i believe you , ingeles?
ah , i think so .
this was where you kept them?
yes .
everything?
even your portuguese rutter?
oh , come on , ingeles !
it had to be portuguese .
how else would you have found your way here?
yes , damn it , even the portuguese rutter .
that's gone , too .
halfway around the earth , and no way to get home .
lord , give me strength !
i know what you feel , ingeles .
i feel sorry for you .
it happened to me once .
he was ingeles , too ... the thief .
may his ship drown , and he burn in hell forever .
come on , let's get back to my ship .
you never saw a slaver move like this ... even with an infidel turk whipping them to a lather .
those are samurai rowers , ingeles .
they'll stroke till they drop dead if lord toranaga wants them to .
how far is this place you're taking me?
osaka?
oh ... 300 odd sea miles , and we'll be there in less than 40 hours .
hey , captain san !
west southwest .
i guess you know your compass , ingeles .
these galleys normally hug the coast for safety , but that would take too much time , and time is important .
toranaga asked me to pilot otura to anjiro and back quickly , and there's a bonus for me if we're on time .
you work for toranaga?
me work for him?
hell , no .
i was just visiting osaka ... my captain and me .
this was just a favor .
they're not good ocean sailors , the japmen .
they're great pirates , fighters , and coastal sailors ... but the deep frightens them .
what are they going to do with me?
whatever the hell they want to do .
what's your own ship like?
oh , i'm the pilot of ... i keep forgetting ... that you're the enemy , ingeles .
portugal and england have been allies for centuries .
but we're not now .
go below , ingeles .
get some rest .
if you want to sleep , use my cabin .
you're tired and so am i .
tired men make mistakes .
how do you feel , ingeles?
rested .
what do you think?
i think there'll be a storm .
when?
before the day is out .
now , that is a safe guess .
if this were your ship , what would you do?
how far is the nearest land?
oh ... three , maybe four hours .
if we run for cover , it'll cost me my bonus .
oh , madonna .
i'm a tired man .
then go sleep .
i'll take the watch for you .
if the wind changes , i'll wake you .
all right , ingeles , i think i'll trust you .
god knows why .
maintain this course .
at the next turn , go four degrees more westerly , and at the next , six more westerly .
wakarimasu ka?
hai .
four degrees westerly it is .
go below , pilot .
your bunk's comfortable .
ah , priest , what have you given me?
god curse me and my lack of wits .
there's a storm there , all right , and this craft won't take much water .
how was your sleep?
short .
and more than i would've had if you weren't here .
can't be tai fun .
what?
tai fun ... huge winds .
worst storms you've ever seen .
we're not in the tai fun season .
when's that?
it's not now , enemy .
still , it looks rotten enough , so maybe i'll take your miserable advice and head for land .
steer nor 'by west .
nor 'by west , aye .
hey , captain san !
isogi , wakarimasu ka?
isogi !
isogi !
what's that ... isogi ...
hurry up "?
well , there's no harm in you
learning a little bit of japman talk , ingeles .
all you need here is about ten words , and then you can make the buggers dance if you want them to .
that's if they're the right words ... and if they're in the mood .
wakarimasu ka?
wakarimasu .
hey , ingeles ... i think maybe you learn too damn fast .
go forward .
get them to start bailing !
make them understand .
hurry , hurry !
ship oars !
stop rowing !
stop rowing !
what do you think , ingeles?
you do what you want , whatever i think , but she won't take much water .
we'll go down like a stone .
ah ... and next time i go forward , tell me you're putting her into the wind !
ah , that was the hand of god , ingeles .
a wave slapped her rump around .
we'll keep her into the wind , then when the time's right , we'll make a stab for the shore .
my nose tells me that , if we turn and run , we're going to flounder !
if we don't turn , we'll never make it !
well , for god's sake , ingeles , what would you do?
wait till we're just past the near headland , then fall off from the wind and make those rowers pull for their lives !
that's dangerous .
i know !
all right .
i'll go forward .
you take the helm .
watch me , and when i signal , go west nor'west for the shore .
you watch me very closely .
i will !
hey .
you'll wait for my order , and obey my orders .
do you want me to take the helm or not?
i have to trust you again , ingeles , and i hate trusting you !
steady as she goes !
hard aport ... now !
hard aport ... aye !
pull , you buggers !
one , two , one , two , one , two !
one , two , one ... damn you , rodrigues !
rodrigues?
rodrigues?
yabu san , thank you for saving his life .
thank you for your courage .
thank you , you black eyed son of a whore .
hai , omi san .
omi san says you may come up , one by one .
lord kasigi yabu has said that you may live in the world of men again , but the smallest breaking of a rule , and you'll all be put back in this pit .
what about the pilot?
what's happened to him?
if you don't come out now , you will stay down there .
where's the other man?
captain general spillbergen's dead , god rest his soul .
he's down there lying in the filth .
omi san wants you to bow to him .
he wants us to come .
come on .
so , now i owe you a life , ingeles .
oh !
god curse you .
it was kasigi yabu who saved your miserable body .
curse him .
no .
no , those jappos would never have come after me if it weren't for you .
the curse is thine .
there's a bottle of grog over there .
here ...
ah .
you'd make a foul nurse , ingeles .
it's your black heart .
bring the bottle over here .
how do you feel?
mmm , better ... considering my head's on fire , and my mouth tastes like a barrel of pig swill .
hey , eh eh eh ... just give me the bottle .
this , uh , toranaga ... why does he want to see me?
i don't know .
by the blessed virgin , i don't know , but since i owe you something , here's some truth in part payment .
never forget that the japmen are six faced and have three hearts ... so be careful , ingeles ... be careful what you say , be careful how you move ... even be careful how you think , especially with toranaga .
toranaga .
what's he like?
same as the rest of them , only worse .
they had 600 years of civil war in this country , ingeles , till about 35 years ago , when this monkey sama by the name of goroda conquered half of all japan and made himself ichi ban ,
lord of the whole rotten country .
and you know who helped him?
toranaga .
then ... well , i guess it was 16 years ago ... one of his own generals killed goroda , and another general stepped right into his sandals ... general nakamura .
and do you know who helped him?
toranaga .
right , ingeles .
toranaga ... and another big monkey sama , ishido .
toranaga in the east , ishido in the west .
sooner or later , there'll be another bloody civil war .
madonna , i think i got drunk last night , ingeles .
where are we?
on course , pilot .
you're the pilot now .
ooh ... oh , a person could think that that was funny .
you're supposed to be the prisoner .
you could be taking us anywhere .
but you ... you wouldn't do that .
if they were taking me to ishido's castle , i'd be damned if i'd be sailing them there .
ishido?
i thought they were taking me to toranaga .
and so they are , ingeles , except that toranaga is in osaka castle for the meeting of the regents and osaka castle belongs to ishido ... and what a butcher he is .
hell , they all are .
everything in this bloody country's upside down .
what are you steering?
south by southwest .
how do you know?
who told you?
you did .
me?
madonna , it's all in a haze .
you looked in my rutter !
ah , ingeles , life is so strange ... and if i live , it is by the grace of god , helped by a heretic and a japman .
there's the sod eating sama .
i'd better go and thank him .
you're a dangerous man , ingeles .
maybe we'd all be better off if they killed you .
osaka ... the white castle city of lord ishido .
an escort of 20 samurai was on the dock , wearing the brown uniform of toranaga's army .
under the command of toranaga's youngest son ,
lord naga .
konnichi wa , naga san .
bow , ingeles , it's toranaga's fifth son .
konnichi wa .
konnichi wa , rodrigues san .
konnichi wa .
all right , that should keep him happy .
come on .
now what's the matter?
you're staying onboard , ingeles .
why?
wouldn't do any good to ask .
when toranaga's ready , you'll find out .
go with god , ingeles .
and you .
