he created an industry .
you lie down , confess your secrets , and you're saved .
the more you confess , the more they think about setting you free .

the doctor put her in a body cast , but also strapped her down . . this has nothing ... . you never told me this .
cari planned this trip to santa monica .
he had a commitment at rand .
so we took her with us .
on the back seat , strapped to this board , 4000 miles .
if you like , mrs. kaysen , we can discuss this ... ... further on the way out .
just how long is my daughter going to be here?
with all due respect , mr. kaysen ... ... psychiatry and economics are different .
the length of susanna's stay isn't fixed .
it depends on her response to treatment .
