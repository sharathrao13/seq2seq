what did he say?
it's fixed , give me your passport ...

that's all i got with me !
that's the only thing i wanted to bring in paris ...
of course , if you'd been here , you could have done something ...
when your friend told me you were living on an island ...
i thought to swin to it ...
but when he showed me where the island was ...
what nonsense are you telling me !
how did you pay him?
i gave him my ticket ...

not bad ...
it'll be nothing ...
what time is it?
where is it?
what?
grasse .
near cannes , in the hill side .
awful not to know such a thing !
i didn't know ...
everybody there work for the perfume industry .
when i was a kid , with my brother , we were apprentices at the distillery .
every day , we picked violets ...
wasn't very hard job to do ...
not hard but you have to get up at four in the morning ...
they have to be picked before the sun appears .
and when there are no more violets ...
then you can use chemistry ...
solo for instance ...
what is " solo "?
i made it , don't you know its name?
maybe " college " , or " variance "?
why do you laugh?
i don't know , all that , this job ...
this job ...
it's an industry you know , a huge industry ...
college " , the one with the bottle looking like an inkpot?
that's it .
i used some when i was in spain .
what did you think about?
expensive !!!
price was not my job !
what do you mean?
i read on a newspaper ...
they say you're very good !
what is the name of your firm?
not my firm , that was not my job ...
so the brunette in the drawer , she's your wife?
she's american?
yep ...
ok , i see ...
what do you mean?
she made you go to the usa , in fact i don't know ...
was she in love with you?
thank you .
sanders ain't your real name , huh?
no , i changed it .
when you change your life ... ... if you want to be left alone ... ... you must change your name too .
and you loved her?
how long did you work for the police? !
it's not because of a woman ...
so what happened exactly?
what happened is ...
i don't know exactly .
everything was going fine ...
i had a lot of ideas , they paid for them ...
paid a lot?
i was the one who paid a lot at the end ...
was too much ...
and you suddenly left everything behind?
yes .
what did you tell them?
nothing ...
not to anyone?
no .
are you nuts !
what are you doing?
it's for the raft !
i take you to st domingue !
on a raft? !
i'm not crazy !
this one won't do .
we'll try to reach the coast , and then we'll ...
what coast?
the closest is la gueira ... ... and it quite far from here !
we might end sailing !
i'm not joking !
then , you'll just have to take a plane ...
well ...
how about you?
i gonna buy another boat , or float my boat off ...
so we won't see each other then ...
no , but we can never know ... fortunately ...
there is fresh coffee in the kitchen .
do you want some?
you know what we'll do , you'll go at la gueira ... ...
i wait here , you come back with a new boat ... ... and we'll go together at st domingue .
no .
i want to stay with you ...
no .
bastard !
why " bastard "? !
where does she go now? !
where do you go?
and polly , how is she?
very well , thanx .
i wanted her to come with me , but she's so scared of planes ...
and the kids?
you mean the grandchildren !
they are in geneve with their parents .
you know , we bought them now ...
yes i know .
coleman told me ...
entrez , miss mark ...
bonjour .
a va?
trs bien , merci .
d'o vient ce vernis?
pas de chez nous ...
je i'ai achet bangkok .
and he is still ignorant yet?
no .
are you sure of that?
yes !
we even have bought his island without him knowing it ...
whom does he pay his rent to?
to the former owners ...
miss marks has settled that with them .
she's terrific !
did you never felt like going and take him back?
not at all !!!
he might go farer than that !
that would cost us more money !
you're absolutely sure he'll come back?
what is he doing?
selling his fruits and vegetables ...
whom does he sell them to?
to us ...
i mean , he sells on markets ... ...
and then , once he's gone , miss mark shows up ...
what's up?
don't you agree?
no i'm not !
he costs us money?
he made us earn a hundred time more !
and he will , more and more !
he's unique !
buying him all the pacific ocean or the atlantic will not make him come back !
then go fetch him with a gun my dear !
i don't need a gun !
i just have to call our lawyers !
do you what is that? !
the 27 contracts he signed before making off !
27 trials !
who's gonna pay?
you?
the japanese has built 4 factories to make perfumes which remain in his mind !
who's gonna pay back?
you?
personnaly , i don't speak japanese ...
because you don't know exactly how much it costed us so far ...
i'll tell you !!!
and me !
wait for me !
i don't leave today , i'm just trying it !

i visited you wednesday , but you ain't at your place ...
what was the time?
