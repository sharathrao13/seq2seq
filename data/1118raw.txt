i started every interview
i've ever given the same way for over 10 years .
so , when did you fall in love with hip hop?
i basically fell in love with hip hop , you know what i'm saying , when cats first started going out to the parks , you know , with the 2 turntables , the mic .
i think it was 1977 .
people are rocking in the parks .
i can remember back in the bronx , 1979 .
set up some turntables in front of the building .
and we was getting the power from the street lamps outside .
plug it up into the street pole .
mc ing , djj ing , b boying , break dancing .
break dancing or popping , beats or rhymes , you know .
i was in love with it .
probably about 12 years old , man .
and i was watching wild style .
it was creative , it was new , it was fresh .
breakin ', rappin ', battlin '.
it was the whole culture , period .
the bambaataa show , the afrika islam show .
it was just like our way of expression .
hip hop spoke directly to me because , you know , it was speaking from the language that the people i was dealing with was speaking , and i loved it as soon as i ...
as soon as i got introduced to it .
i was gonna be dealing with hip hop whether i wanted to or not .
like a forced marriage , it was predetermined .
and i heard eric b is president , and then that kind of changed my life .
i heard the message , melle mel .
there was a rapper named eddie cheeba who was one of the pioneers .
when i first heard sugarhill gang .
rapper's delight .
rapper's delight .
that set it off for rap music .
funky four plus one more .
plus one more , you know what i'm saying?
furious five , freedom .
run and them and whoudini freestyling .
sucka mc's by run dmc .
sucka mc's live .
grandmaster flash on the wheels of steel .
grandmaster caz from the cold crush brothers .
cold crush .
cold crush .
cold crush .
grandmaster flash .
treacherous three , body rock .
spoonie gee , love rap .
the first time i heard rebel without a pause .
eric b and rakim .
epmd and them .
i gotta say public enemy as a group ... you know .
classics , bangers .
i mean , to this day they're bangers .
i just love what it sounded like , and i loved what he was saying .
you know , the whole slick tongue thing .
i felt like these dudes hit the truth .
forget everything else you heard on the radio and all that .
this is it .
this is what i want to do .
i was in .
it was freedom .
i remember the exact day
i fell in love with hip hop .
it was ...
bye !
yo , look , y'all !
look what they doing over there !
come on !
# the mic almost dropped but i catch quick #
# and from that point we get hectic #
# now , i score the ladies , i score the boys #
# i am the one and only art of noise #
# what up , hear , hear? #
# dana dane #

# when out of nowhere dropped this fiendish fiend #
# i want your shoes , your jewels , man , everything #

# reading the news #
# here comes grandma #

# i smile , although i was quite disgusted #
# i said " what's the matter , granny #
# is your blind ass dusted? " #
the day i saw slick rick , who went by ricky d back then ,
dana dane , and doug e. fresh battle in the bronx was the day i truly met hip hop .
little did i know a year later
ricky d would would join the get fresh crew and record the hip hop classic the show , and of course the b side la di da di .
dana dane would drop a couple years later with his classic cinderfella .
but little did i know how much hip hop would be a part of my life .
hip hop was as young , naive , confused , sometimes innocent , and sometimes as mischievous as i was .
and as i grew up ...
later , dre .
later , sid .
hip hip grew with me , and along the way it took on all my baggage ... my dreams .
i felt hip hop , and hip hop felt me .

besides , there's order in this chaos .
i know where everything is and where everything goes .
so , uh , where does this go?
ooh !
it's not what you think .
it's a massager from brookstone .
oh , come on , sid , like i don't know ...
it's a massager !
men take too much of your time .
time i don't have .
you're turning into a terry mcmillian character .

i'm telling you you're in trouble .
oh , it's just i never seem to find anyone on the same page with me .
what , like dre?
oh , here we go .
come on .
you're gonna tell me you never thought about hooking up?
dre asked me once when i was at columbia if we should try being more than just friends , and ...
i told him no .
no? !
what is wrong with you , girl?
i mean , we've been through everything together .
exactly .
so if you two hook up , you get the best of both worlds .
you get the buddy and the booty .
i hear you , but relationships break up .
people get angry , they never want to talk to each other again .
i mean , you're divorced .
terrell was your ace , right?
you still talk to him?
me and terrell talk all the time .
we talk about alimony , we talk about that tramp ...
exactly , exactly .
and you know dre .
he's never been with a woman more than a month .
yeah , well , looks like he's gonna keep this one .
guess so .
ooh , she invited me to her bridal tea shower thingy , and i don't know what to bring .
you haven't changed a bit .
want me to pick something up for you?
oh , would you , would you?
i got you , cuz , i got you covered .
you're the best cousin in the world .
so what do you want me to do with your massager?
high speed , low .
sidney !

i'll ask the same questions .
what is dre's middle name?
fine .
romulus .
what'd you say , sidney?

that's right .
that's the name of this shake dancer , works club mozambique .
ok , aunt betty .
ok , anyway ...
romulus is right .
what is dre's favorite drink?
cosmo .
a polar bear .
ketel one martini up with a twist , but if he's trying to show off , macallan 25 .

thanks for meeting me .
you're my dawg .
it's good , huh?
mmm !
i love these bad boys .
it's true .
i can't even front .
whenever i go out with reese , we always going to some fancy spot with white tablecloths and a lot of silverware , hosting one of reese's clients .
i haven't had one of these bad boys since we started dating .
wow .
she must really be something .
mmhh .
yeah , for sure .
she's brown sugar .
oh , yeah , the brown sugar .

you know , hella ... hella sexy , but not a ho .
that's brown sugar .
that's my reesey .
i mean , don't get confused by her business suit .
she is a freak in the bedroom ...
a little bit too much information .
hey , i'm just letting you know .
then on the converse side of things , you got the girls at the video shoots with their breasts all propped up and their booties hanging out of their dresses .
i like to refer to them as the cyndi lauper honeys .
they just like to have fun .
don't get it twisted .
i'll tap that as well .
oh , i forgot being best friends with a man means i get to find out the stupid and simple ways they look at women .
well , that's how men are , stupid and simple .
see , that's the problem with y'all women .
you ...
you're all too complicated .
you keep trying to change every man into the marrying type , and you just can't do it .
well , i guess reese did a good number on you .
ooh , touch , touch , touch .
and tell me , then ...
dreski , what type am i?
you could probably be in a video .
do this .
dre ...

dre !
dre .
what do you think about this for the mantle?
that sounds so cool .
i never had a mantle before .
it's cute .
it's not really you , though .
now this is tight .
oh , couples love that piece because it's not too masculine , it's not too feminine .
i like to call it a compromising piece .
let me guess .
newlyweds , right?
no , we just ...
pu lease , we are just friends , that's it .
oh , um , i'm sorry .
i just thought , um ...
well , if you need any help finding friend things just ask .

and i realized that i'm the character you're writing on when you say that hip hop has lost its way .
dre , i was talking in general terms .
sid , i could ...
i could feel that look of yours from 3, 000 miles away .
and i was ready , too .
i was ready to leave millenium .
you know , give them my high minded speech and just bounce .
then i started thinking about the money , upward mobility , the suits ...
and i punked out .
you didn't punk out .
well , you gotta admit , i punked out a little bit .
not even a little bite sized ,
melt in your mouth , not in your hand " punk out?
ok , maybe a tiny bite sized punk out .
see?
dre , we all sell out a little in our careers .
it's how you survive the business .
why did it all get so complicated?
i mean , all i wanted to do was make music , and now i'm not doing that .
all i'm doing now is making deals and 10 % of them is shady .
all right , 30 % .
fine , 50 % .
but you see what i'm saying?

the union of hip hop to the mainstream was a hard thing to imagine .
hip hop was always this personal , regional thing that belonged to just me .
starting with fab 5 freddie and yo . !
mtvraps . !
anyone with a television set and cable box could get a piece of hip hop .
i knew i was gonna have to share , and that was hard to get used to .
# one shot to your heart without breaking your skin #
# no one has the power #
# to hurt you like your kin #
# kept it inside , didn't tell no one else #
# didn't even wanna admit it to yourself #
# and now it just burns and your back aches #
# from 15 years of holding the pain #
# and now you only have yourself to blame #
# if you continue to live this way #
# get it together #
# get it together #

i kept getting phone calls from all your ex girlfriends .
here .
thank you , baby .
baby ...
mmm?
mmm ...
i love you ... and , uh , ahem ...
i quit my job today .
why?
'cause , baby , i just ...
i needed to .
i had to .
l ...
i'm gonna start my own label .
i'm gonna do all the things that i've ever wanted to do .
i thought you were doing all of that at millenium .
no , not at millenium .
i wasn't .
i mean , you know how much i love music , how much i love hip hop ,
how it makes me feel , dre ...
and i lost that love at millenium .
how could you make a change like this without consulting me?
'cause this is something i had to do for me .
plus , i know you would've just tried to talk me out of it , and ...
it's not fair for you to assume that .
you don't know that .
reese , you mean to tell me , had i told you , you wouldn't have tried to talk me out of it?
yes , i would have tried to talk you out of it , but i'm supposed to do that .
you get so excited , and you don't think straight , and then you do something like this .
you can't make a major life decision just because you feel like it ...
i don't need you to be my lawyer !
reesey , i need you to be my wife .
and a husband is supposed to consult his wife when he changes the plan .
and a wife supports her husband !
baby , i need your support !
ok , fine .
i support you .
i'll call some money people .
we'll get this squared away .
that's all taken care of .
uh ...
sid said she'd help out with some of the investing , and ...
sidney?
sidney knew about this before me?
reesey , baby , please , you know she's my friend ...
your friend .
ok .
damn , dre .
reese .
well , i see you have it all under control .
i'm really happy for you .
who , whoa , whoa , whoa .
slow your roll .
reesey !
reese !
no , you slow your roll .
reese !
dre?
i'm fine .
you did all right .
just all right .
ok .
so ...
so , you're used to guys closing down restaurants on their busiest nights , huh?
commandeering the kitchen , serving you like a queen .
you're used to all that , huh?
you ballplayers .
all right .
i didn't think so .
you think you're gonna get some booty , don't you?
well , yeah .
yeah?
that's the plan .
one of these days .
come on , that's what this is all about .
you know , the dating , the awkward walks home .
that's what men and women do .
you got it all figured out , don't you?
i'm just tryin 'to be straight up .
you put a man and a woman together long enough , and ... something's gonna go down .
well , what makes you think you gonna be around long enough for something to go down?
well , i think i got a pretty good shot .
it's not that good .
especially outside 20 feet .
and you could work on that d a little , too .
oh , really?
really .
ok .
come here .
how was that shot?
nothin 'but net .

no .
tsk ... he's runnin 'game on you .

sidney , hi !
hey , how you doing?
i never see you in here .
well ...
i usually don't have the time , but ... ever since dre started this record label project ,
i've had a lot more free time .
so i guess i actually have you to thank for bringing me back to class .
me?
yeah .
you know?
for all of your support of dre and his project .
all right , everybody , listen up .
we're just about ready to go .
i want you to find a partner , grab a pair of focus mitts .
we're gonna do some punch combos .
alternate on my whistle .
oh , thanks .
i'm already working with my man right here .
just you and me .
whoa .
ohh !
you ok , reese?
oh , yeah , i'm fine .
i'm just ...
fine .
i'm ...
i'm just ... thankin 'you .
ok , reese .
we're both big girls .
let's let it out .
you have a problem with me and my friendship with dre?
no , i don't have a problem with your friendship with dre .
i have a problem ... that you're in love with dre .
what?
it's understandable .
dre's an incredible man .
listen , me and dre have been through a lot together .
so , yes , i love him as a friend ,
like a brother , but that's it !
friend , brother , whatever .
he ...
he lets you in ... in a way that he hasn't let me in yet .
and all the secrets ...
i have to ... beg for ... you already know !
so just maybe the fact that ... you're that close ... bothers me !
i realize my friendship with dre may make things awkward ... but i am not gonna apologize for it !
i don't want you to apologize for it !
that's not what i'm saying .
i knew you were friends with dre when we got married , but this is not what i expected .
this was not part of our plan .
i never see him any ... more ... because of this ... record label thing !
you just said " record label thing ,
like it's a hobby or a distraction .
this label is more than just a thing to him !
well , you know , like i said , i guess ... you know him better than i do .

anyway , this has been a hell of a year , as all of y'all know , full of ups and downs .
um ... for one , i married this beautiful young woman beside me ... mmm ...
which is cool .
but i also lost my job at millenium .
no , no , bruh , the job lost you .
that's right !
yeah , ok , i like that .
i like that .
but because of it ,
i , um ...
i was able to start my own label .
all right !
whoo !
that took a lot of courage .
thank you .
i would like to thank all of y'all for all of y'all's support during this , uh ... this time .
i would especially ... [ sighs ]
like to thank my best friend , who , uh , left that 75 degree weather to come back home .
you are the perfect verse over a tight beat .
ooh !
word up !
to hip hop .
and to the new year !
yeah !
to the new year .
hippy hip hip !
yeah !
yeah , yeah !
ok .
let's get to the food !
yeah !
excuse me .
uh , since ... uh , since we're all celebrating ,
i'd like to ... excuse me .
i'm sorry .
i'd like to take this to another level .
ok , bruh , could we just stop at the food level real quick , though?
let me just do this ...
do this real quick , and then ...
and then we'll eat .
thank you .
all right .
can i have one ...
one , uh ... one second , please?
let me take this .
ok .
ahem .
ohh !
oh , my goodness !
oh , my goodness .
oh , shit , we ain't never gonna eat now .
i love you so much .
would you do me the honor of being my wife?
i don't ...
i don't know what to say .
say yes .
yes .
all right !
aah !
yeah !
yes .
so , what is the difference between rap and hip hop?
it's simple .
it's like the difference between saying you love somebody and being in love with somebody .
rap is just a word .
um , what are you doin '?
gettin 'more to drink .
you know what i'm talkin 'about .
gettin 'into this whole ... marriage thing .
don't you think this is just a little too fast?
you've only known the cat for a couple months .
about as long as you knew reese before you got married .
that's why you doing this?
this whole competition thing?
what , i marry reese and you marry sasquatch?
oh , so now i'm doing this 'cause of you?
you arrogant son of a bitch !
you really on your own sack right now .
so i guess since i can't marry you , i'm marrying kelby .
no , no , no , no !
no , that's not what i meant .
no .
hey ...
sid , that's not what i meant .
sid , don't ...
sid !
sidney !
you need to talk to your friend .
what y'all goin 'through?
you crazy .
ahh , here we go .
hey ...
hey .
hey .

just gettin 'these champagne flutes .
yeah , that's funny .
you ever wonder why they call them champagne flutes?
no , i never really thought about it .
oh , shoot !
hey , don't break the flute now .
if you find out , get back to me and let me know .
i will .
hey , that's a nice outfit .
you look real ... real nice .
and the food was tight , too .
it was tasty and nutritious .
oh , shit .

oh ...
it's so hard to get respect as an mc when you're a ballplayer .

rappers who play sports .
yeah .
yes .
same thing .
but i was thinking , you could be my mentor .
right .
you know what i'm sayin '?
yeah .

you could work it out so my ... my ... my lyrics get tight .
tight .
tight lyrics .

you know what i think?
you should hire a lawyer to negotiate your contract .
you serious?
yeah , i mean , why pay an agent 4 % to negotiate numbers that are already set by a salary base cap?
dre , don't say anything .
quit while we still have a friendship .
hey , that's what i'm tryin 'to do right now .
i'm trying to save our friendship .
i'm worried about you .
worried about me?
yeah !
you need to stop worrying about me and worry about your own marriage .
so you're ... excuse me .
so you're the attorney
i'm supposed to hire , right?
yeah !
very good !
my marriage?
what you mean?
what's that supposed to mean?
nothing .
nothing .
sidney .
what's that supposed to mean?
maybe this is not the best place ...
the best time to talk business , but i'm sure we'll have plenty of opportunity since our spouses are best friends .
best ...
best friends .
they're so close .
yeah , well , how ... how do you feel with them being so close?
well , let's just say it's very hard to get used to .
sidney , what did you mean? !
sid ...
can we just drop this already?
tell ...
tell me what you meant .
nothing .
no !
you said ...
te ...
nothing .
just ... tell me .

nothing .
it's nothing .
it's just i ...
i've been seeing her at the gym a lot lately , and ... [ sighs ] a lot of guys try and run game on her , and , i don't know , she don't seem to mind .
hmm .
she's a flirt .
all right?
she flirts ...
she flirts a lot .
she's always been a flirt .
and she's flirted with me .
i'm cool with that .
she flirt .
ok .
that's what i thought .
you're probably right .
it's when you talk like that , that's what makes me think that you're jealous .
what? !
yes .
jealous !
no wonder you two are married .
you're both crazy !
look here , contrary to what you and your wife may think ,
i don't spend my nights thinkin 'about you , ok? !
i got a man who's fine , intelligent , successful , and gives it to me on a very , very regular basis , and the shit is the bomb !
so?
i don't care what ...
dre , i need you to be happy for me .
i need you to be there for me , just like you asked of me .
so ...

oh ...
iook , hey , i'm sorry .
i didn't ...
that's cool .
that's cool .
how could you know?
she ain't wearing the $15, 000 ring that i bought her ass .
i'm still paying it off , but you understand .
actually , i'm paying for it .
could you not put my business out on the street?
will you be joining us for dinner?
listen , my man ...
you know what?
we were just about to leave .
i'm trying to order the most expensive bottle of champagne , 'cause we fixin 'to celebrate .
dre .
we gonna celebrate what?
# my divorce # how about that?
and some pork chops .
dre , come on .
'cause i'm kind of hungry .
all right?
you're making a scene .
good .
i want to make a scene .
you know what i'm sayin '?
bye bye , richard lawson .
this is so embarrassing .
i can't believe you got me to do that .
hey , stop complaining .
you forget it was me who helped you
let all the air out of shawn's tires when he asked angie to the homecoming dance instead of you .
key word : home ... coming .
high school .
we're almost 30 years old , dre .
oh , time is a bitch .
i swear , i still feel like we're just those 2 kids pop locking at the block parties .
you remember my first little beat machine?
boy , you thought you were d nice .
the tr 808 .
bust this .
simplicity provides
a fine line between eloquence and plainness .
that's a dope line .
and i know ll didn't think he was that deep .
that was my first published article .
i can't wait for your book to come out .
and when you left ,
i went out , got the l. a. times , every wednesday , for your column .
i'd go to the park and read it .
i don't know , it just ... made me feel closer to you .
uh ... you want anything?
coffee?
vodka?
uh , no .
i wanted them pork chops .
i told you we should have stayed for dinner .
how can you ... joke about this?
'cause i would be flipping out .
ha ha !
sid , i do not know .
i guess i'll break down later .
you know what , though?
i ...
i ...
i'm glad i know now .
i guess i always knew deep down inside that we weren't meant to be together .
yeah?
mm .
and when did you figure that out?
the night before the wedding .
something happened between me leaving the house ... and , uh ... getting to the wedding .
but , you know , i shook it off ,
'cause , damn , i had a beautiful woman that loved me to death .
so , you know , i took all those feelings and ... locked them away ,
'cause not everybody can marry their one true love .
it was a pretty difficult situation .
do you , uh ... you know anybody like that?
no , i don't .
no?
but ...
i do know somebody that was friends with this guy a long time , and ... she thought maybe it was more than just ... friends , but ... something happened to her , coincidentally , before your wedding .
oh , yeah?
and ... she realized it was nothing more than just friends .
nothing?
nothing .
just friends?
just friends .
i can't believe what just happened .
i know .
i don't know what to say .
i mean , usually i'm like the energizer bunny .
you know .
i keep goin 'and goin '...
i was talking about us ... doing it .
this was bad .
we made a huge mistake .
honey , i said i was sorry .
i mean , next time i won't be so caught off guard .
i'll use a little ginseng .
there isn't gonna be a next time .
don't you get it?
this was bad .
real , real bad .
it couldn't have been that bad .
dre , i'm not talking about that .
i'm getting married .
you're still married .
and we ... we just got busy .
where are my shoes?
they're downstairs .
wait .
where you goin '?
this is your spot .
i need to get myself together .
i have to meet kelby after the game .
wait .
you're not gonna tell him , are you?
what are you gonna tell him?
are you gonna tell him?
i don't know .
i ...
i ...
i ...
no , i'm not .
i'm not .
i'm ...
he doesn't know what happened and i want to keep it that way .
well , you're not gonna ... are you still gonna marry this cat after what we just had?
dre ... what just happened was the most ... amazing ... most fulfilling ... most exhilarating ... 5 minutes i've ever had in my life .
7 .
10 minutes .
9?
ok .
8 .
whatever .
the point is , what do we do now?
we can't just go back to the way things were .
wait , wait .
what are you saying?
i need space .
us staying so close , spending so much time together , just confuses things for me right now .
and besides , we wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for you catching reese .
why are you talking like that?
why does it have to be all or nothing?
because we both know it's the right thing to do .
hey .
i know you've done this mad times .
i know you know what you're doing .
but , you know , when you go in there , just , you know , be firm with them , you know what i'm sayin '?
yeah .
don't punk out like you did with sidney .
just ... you stand your ground .
i never punk out with sidney .
you did .
all i did was respect her wishes .
sound like some punk logic right there .
how you figure?
what about francine?
you were feeling her , right?
yeah .
you ain't doin 'nothin 'about it .
i'm not ... the humphrey bogart in this .
i'm the peter lorre .
i'm the sidekick character .
you the humphrey bogart .
you had your opening .
you know what i'm saying?
she wanted you to stop her from marrying the old dude , but you let it ride , you know?
same thing bogey did , man .
you're the same dude .
man , don't be dissin 'humphrey bogart , man .
why not?
'cause he's humphrey bogart .
he's the man .
yo , he was fightin 'a war .
that's what they did back then .
you know what he needed to do back then?
he needed to stop fine ass ingrid bergman from gettin 'on the plane with the corny dude .
and then , he gonna walk off in the fog with some other dude .
come on , man .
with another dude , in the fog?
come on .
2 grown men walk off in a fog , you don't know where they goin '?
think about it , man .
you smoke too much grass , man .
i hope you don't think you walkin 'off noplace with me , man .
matter of fact , let me sit over here .
don't fight it .
i'm not here with him .
i came by myself .
i'm a solo artist .
i'm doin 'my own thing .
security .
a'ight , we got a new joint for y'all .
i want you to check this out .
new millenium recording artists ren and ten .
# hey , yo , ren #

# i can fix it up right quick ... #
how many?
# listen , y'all ... #
i don't think so .
hey .
what the hell is this?
i said to give me space and then you pull this stuff?
what ...
what are you talkin 'about?
guess what demo i heard for our unsigned underground review today .
are you serious?
dre , don't act like you didn't plan this .
you know the editor does the unsigned reviews .
why would i need to plan?
i could have just given it to you at any time .
i was hoping it got the xxl
'cause the shit's tight , not 'cause i know you .
well , i'm not doing the review .
i gave it to gabe .
why'd you give it to gabe?
i gave you money to help start the label .
doesn't the conflict of interest seem obvious?
all right .
well , what did gabe say?
it wasn't a bad review .
he dissed us .
he didn't diss it .
he just wasn't feelin 'it .
sid , you gotta step in .
you gotta do your thing .
you're editor .
i mean , you heard the cd .
i can't do that , dre .
i can't step on his review .
you're the main person that's talkin 'about hip hop losin 'its way , how we gotta get back to its roots .
what's wrong with getting in touch with why we both fell in love with hip hop in the first place?
'cause it's about forward movement .
innovate and move on .
one minute you talkin 'about you want things to change , and the next minute you talking about you want things to stay the same .
i do want things to change .
i just don't like how things have changed .
and ...
and i didn't know this is how it would turn out .
and that's why we need to look back , ok?
'cause if we look back , it will make us see things ...
the mistakes we've made , things that we never knew were there before .
and if we just can stop ... then maybe we can find that thing ... that we both know is missing ... and build on that .
are we ... are we still talking about hip hop?
that's all we've ever talked about .
it's all we've ever known ... from when we were 10 .
sid , just do me a favor .
before you do something you might regret , just ... just listen again .
just listen again .
and just follow your heart .
and whatever you decide ... whatever you decide is cool .
whatever you decide is cool .
dre ...
dre .
i've made my decision .
you ain't gonna change your mind?
what about your heart , sid?
sid?
hey .
can i get you something , sir?
yes .
macallan 25 , neat .
hey .
hey .
you smell nice .
uh ... you gonna have to treat me ,
'cause i can't afford that shit no more .
here .
please .
you couldn't afford it then , remember?
i had to keep playing if i was gonna get your number .
damn .
i lost nearly $200 that night .
yeah , yeah .
dre ...
so , what ... why'd you , uh ... why'd you call me here tonight?
so we could have a drink , laugh on our good times , and , uh , act like none of this ever happened?
yes and no .
i went to a divorce lawyer today .
and ... he asked me one simple question .
have we tried to make it work?
are you serious?
dre , let me finish .
we never tried .
we just assumed it was over ,
like we were in high school or something .
but we're not .
we're married .
we took those vows , dre .
you broke those vows .
come on .
i know that you and sidney have something very special that you share .
i also know there's a reason you made me your wife .
and i ... and i'm hoping that whatever that reason is , it's enough to make you want to keep me as your wife .
oh , reesey .
i do .
i love you .
but i think we both know that this can't work .
i don't know if we have enough of ... what it takes to ... to make this last .
i don't know if we ever had enough .
we can't stay married .
another round?
damn .
well ... at least ... stay a while and have a few drinks and ... have a few laughs .
i hope you realize this means that i have to take half of everything you have .
let me make it easy on you .
here's my little $58 . 25 now .
kelby ... sorry i'm late .
i'm sorry .
well , we missed the show .
i'm sorry .
i just got caught in the middle of this tug of war between dre's label and xxl and ...
i don't know what to do .
i feel so helpless .
kelby , we can see the show on saturday .
yep .
will you wait up a second?
how long are you two gonna play this game?
what are you talking about?
what am i talking about?
you don't want to get married .
i love you .
but not the way you love him .
i'm sorry .
i don't know why your heart doesn't do what your mind tells it .
you don't know .
i'm sorry .
# lying here #
# how bad i feel #
# the clock tick #
# and i think of you ... #
i always thought , one day i would outgrow my relationship with hip hop .
# confusion #
# is nothing new #
i never thought it was a fad , like many .
# flash back #
# all night #
but i never thought it could grow and mature .
# almost left behind #
# suitcase #
# of memories #
# time after sometimes #
# you picture me #
# i'm walking #
# too far ahead #
# you're calling to me ... #
i thought it would be an adolescent memory
i'd look back on ,
like a crush on the captain of the football team .
but i realize we have more than that .
much more .
we have a history ... a friendship .
we listen to each other .
we laugh together .
we finish each other's lyrics .
i don't have to pretend with hip hop , and hip hop doesn't have to pretend with me .
# you will find me #
# time after time #
my feelings have never been more clear , and i know they will never go away .
# i'll be waiting #
to hip hop .
# time after time #
# mmm mmm ... #
# mmm mmm ... #
wait .
didn't i already see you?
mm , yeah .
so what are you doing back here?
i know that y'all put a new song in rotation every week .
so i figure
i'm gonna show up every week till you take a serious listen to this cd .
then i'm gonna come back every week until you put this here cd into rotation .
every week .
she say no .
you playin '.
uh uh .
no , man .
you're not playin '?
i'm not playin ', man .

whoo !
whoo hoo hoo !
we did it , man .
you are the man !
# i worship at the temple of hip hop #
# attended service , eric gave a sermon #
# but the minister became intensely nervous #
# when the killa priest went buck wild #
# and made the reverend run #
# i reached in ... #
she said the angie show , right?
they still come on at the same time , right?
yes , man .

yeah , man .
i told you you was a punk .
