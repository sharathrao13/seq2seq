shannon and i were strangers .
we never would have met if ...
we wouldn't even have spoken if ...
but we did meet , and we did speak .
at least ...
i loved her .
may she rest in peace .
you hungry?
i'm just gonna mash you up some fruit here .

kate .
hey , you missed the funeral .
yeah , uh , i was with sawyer .
oh , right .
a few of them came , the new people .
not her , the one who killed shannon .
that would have been awkward .
they seem to have had a rough time of it .
looks like they went bloody " lord of the flies " out there .
you haven't listened to a word i've said .
do you think there are horses here?
what?
i think i saw a horse in the jungle .
i've seen polar bears .
i've seen monsters .

yeah , charlie , everything's fine .
thank you .

from the moment the alarm sounds , you will have four minutes to enter the code into the microcomputer processor .
induction into the program .
when the alarm sounds , either you or your partner must input the code .
it is highly recommended that you and your partner take alternating shifts .
in this manner , you will stay as fresh and alert .
it is most important that when the alarm sounds , the code be entered correctly and in a timely fashion .
do not attempt to use a computer for any
congratulations .
until your replacements arrive , the future of the project is in your hands .
on behalf of the degroots ,
alvar hanso and all of us at the dharma initiative , thank you , namaste , and good luck .
all right .
so you've been pushing that button every two hours since you got down here .
that's right .
how's that even work?
i've set up 2 person shifts , 6 hours .
everyone's on the roster .
don't they want to know why?
i think the film is pretty self explanatory .
really?
all i heard was something about electromagnets and an incident .
what about all the missing pieces?
oh , you mean the splices?
yeah , just a frame here and there , i think , nothing important .
what do you think?
about the film , what do you think?
i'm sorry i missed it , her funeral .
i ...
i had to be with sawyer , so ...
why aren't you with him now?
'cause i'm going crazy .
do you believe in ghosts , sayid?
i saw walt in the jungle just before shannon was shot .
does that make me crazy?
it's a long drive back to the arraignment .
you comfy?
why now?
what?
nice corn fed farm girl like yourself , no history of violence , straight a's , no record , a couple of speeding tickets .
i just gotta wonder , why'd you kill him now?
oh , right , yeah , don't tell me .
you wouldn't want to incriminate yourself , not after you were so smart planning it .
that jury back in iowa sure ain't gonna get hung upon premeditation .
and a gas leak?
come on , it's amateur hour from top to bottom .
it sounds like you've got it all figured out .
i do have you all figured out .
you don't know anything about me .
white trash mom divorces dad , starts up with some guy who's a drinker , maybe he knocks her around a little bit , and so she marries him because , you know , that's what happens .
and then this drunk , this wayne , he moves into your house , and you get to lay there every night and listen to him doing your mom right there in your daddy's old bedroom .
and even that wouldn't be so bad if he didn't beat her up all the time .
but she loves him , she defends him .
if that don't make a person want to kill somebody , i don't know what does .
but the question is , now?
why now?
why after all these years did you just decide to blow poor wayne up?
he come knocking on your door late at night?
he never touched me .
look out !
get ... get off !
well , why can't you just put the numbers in now?
no , it doesn't work that way .
the alarm goes off in four minutes .
you can't type anything till then .
you mind if i check out some of this hardware?
sure .
just don't break it .
hello again .
hello .
i have something i think you should see .
if you don't mind , i will begin at the beginning .
long before christ , the king of judah was a man named josiah .
boy , when you say " beginning , " you mean beginning .
at that time , the temple where the people worshipped was in ruin , and so the people worshipped idols , false gods , and so the kingdom was in disarray .
josiah , since he was a good king , sent his secretary to the treasury and said , " we must rebuild the temple .
give all of the gold to the workers so that this will be done .
but when the secretary returned , he had no gold .
and when josiah asked why this was , the secretary replied ...
we found a book .
do you know this story?
no , afraid i don't .
what the secretary had found was an ancient book , the book of law .
you may know it as the old testament .
and it was with that ancient book , not with the gold , that josiah rebuilt the temple .
on the other side of the island , we found a place much like this .
and in this place , we found a book .
i believe what's inside there will be of great value to you .
hey .
so rose's husband's white .
didn't see that one coming .
is there something you need , hurley?
no .
just taking a walk , thought i'd say " hey .
who's taking care of sawyer?
sun is .
so you're , like , mad at him?
why would i be mad at sawyer?
maybe 'cause he's the one always comes down here and chops wood and now you are .
it's , like , transference .
what are you , a shrink now?
well , that's what they call it in the mental hospital .
i'm not mad at anyone .
where's jack?
i don't know .
he didn't come back .
has he said anything?
sawyer?
no , he's still sleeping .
can you watch him?
i can stay if you  no .
yeah , i can .
thanks .
uh huh .
yes , i'm sure that's the exact form you've got .
uh huh .
i'll send one over to you , right .
i'll call you back later .
hi , dad .
katie , the police and the u. s. marshals are looking for you .
you shouldn't have come here .
i've been waiting outside for 2 hours .
they're not here .
is it true what they're saying?
katie , what did you come here for?
why didn't you tell me , dad?
tell you what?
i was making a scrapbook , a surprise for your birthday , so i called one of your c. o. s to get some pictures of you in uniform .
the pictures that he sent me had dates on the back , photos of you in korea up until four months before i was born .
why didn't you tell me that wayne was my father?
why?
i didn't tell you because i knew you'd kill him .
and your mother ...
loved him .
you were 5 years old .
i wanted to take you along with me .
she wouldn't let me .
so why didn't you kill him?
because i don't have murder in my heart .
i'm gonna have to call 'em .
can i have an hour?
bye , daddy .
can you hear me?
sawyer?
wayne?
i'm probably crazy , and this doesn't matter ,
but maybe you're in there .
somehow you asked me a question .
you asked me why i ... why i did it .
it wasn't 'cause you drove my father away or the way you looked at me or because you beat her .
it was 'cause i hated that you were a part of me , that i would never be good , that i would never have anything good .
and every time that i look at sawyer , every time i feel something for him ,
i see you , wayne , and it makes me sick .
that's about the sweetest thing i've ever heard .
sawyer?
who the hell is wayne?
where am i?
a bunk bed?
yeah , you're in a bunk bed .
are we saved?
no , sawyer .
not yet .
voil .
what are the odds?
the odds?
yeah .
here , hold this down on the table here , nice and flat .
i mean , think about it .
somebody made this film .
someone else cut this piece out .
we crash .
two halves of the same plane fall on different parts of the island .
you're over there .
i'm over here .
and now here's the missing piece , right back where it belongs .
what are the odds?
don't mistake coincidence for fate .
you've gotta be kidding me .
air lock's over this way .
oh .
come on , admit it .
we've been rescued .
you got it?
sorry .
watch yourself .
son of a bitch .
watch yourself , okay?
okay .
home sweet home .
yeah .
i really thought you were yanking my chain .
what do you keep smiling at?
you need a haircut .
oh , really?
maybe you ought to take me back inside .
you see that?
if you mean the big ass horse standing in the middle of the jungle , then , yeah .
you know that horse , freckles?
yeah , i do .
tequila and tonic .
that's your drink , right?
where's the tonic?
we're running a little low on mixers .
sure you want to waste that on me?
i figured you could use a drink .
i know i could .
you're gonna try to convince me that everyone here doesn't hate me?
only if you're gonna try to convince me that every woman in the world's not crazy .
when the alarm sounds , either you or your partner must input the code .
it is highly recommended that you and your partner take alternating shifts .
in this manner , you will both still stay as fresh and alert .
it is most important that when the alarm sounds , the code be entered correctly and in a timely fashion .
here it comes .
do not attempt to use the computer for anything else other than the entering of the code .
this is its only function .
the isolation that attends the duties associated with station 3 , may tempt you to try and utilize the computer for communication with the outside world .
this is strictly forbidden .
attempting to use the computer in this manner will compromise the integrity of the project and worse , could lead to another incident .
i repeat , do not use the computer for anything other than entering the code .
congratulations .
until your replacements arrive , the future of the project is in your hands .
hello?
hello?
who is this?
this michael .
who is this?
dad?
