why are you guys like so serious?
we're gonna fix bobby kent's ass .

and a straw?
how we're gonna do it?
i was thinking ... we could drive by his house when he's in his yard or some shit .
and shoot'im down .
cops'll think it's a gang thing .
no ... somebody might see us , lis .
you know what we could do , we could go into the guy's house , while he's sleeping ... and stab the fuckin in the neck
he's got a doberman .
best way's just to shoot'im .
how are we get a gun?
my mom has one .
we cant just knock him over the head and drag him off somewhere .
how come?
he's too strong .
wait a sec , havent you ever met him before?

hi donny .
hi heather .

yes , ma'm .
okay ...
are we really gonna do this?
ali , can you get this guy to shut up?
shut up , donny .
we have to figure out a way to get him alone .
he's gotta be by himself .
yeah , that's so much easier to kill someone when his by himself .
ali , what if you'd offer to fuck him again?
isnt this the guy who raped you?
what do you mean lis , like bait?
yeah
it's not enough for him to go .
what if offer to let him dug out my five point o ...
excuse me?
and then offer to fuck him again he can drive you out to the barren's .
wait a second .
ok .
if ali is supposed to be banging bobby , then what the fuck is donny doing here?
i mean seriously like the guy is just gonna go and kick it while smbd else screws his chick?
nobody's that big of a dweeb .
he's right
we can say that i'm heather's boyfriend .

marty , what's with this shit?
i dont know , i guess she digs you .
got me jealous over here man .
she's fine .
hey , are you there with fuck face?
yeah

ok , so we do it and just roll the body into the canal .
the fuckin gators are gonna eat his ass for lunch .

you're in the best position to do it .
you fuck him , and then right when he's gonna cum , you blow his brains out
oh , shit .
man , thats kewl .
i dont want him dead ...
ali , you said you wanted him dead too .
it's too risky if i do it .
i'd have to folow , and he'd might hear me coming .

all right , fuck it ... let's go .
hey bobby , i'm heather's girl ... boyfrind ...

i dont know .
i mean they get crazy and stuff sometimes , but ...
i'm just like hanging out ...

you know , when we lived in the bronx at least we had family ...
family kept things tight and safe .
down here in florida , nobody's tight .
everybody's just ... whatever

nothing .
i just ... i love you ali , i truely love you .
me too , ali .
you know we are gonna be okay , guys ... you know?
we'll get this shit behind us ...
we gonna be back , in time , in palm bay , for donny's birthday at his mom's house .
shit , i never knew nobody who killed somebody .
me neither .
just my grandpa ... i never knew him .
my grandpa was a bad junk ... really bad .
he'd rape anyone dumb enough to walk by his room ...
one night , he got , really pissed on my grandma , he need to take a climb on to her face ,
and , after that , he just , he locked himself up with her in his room , for two whole days
and he just kept drinking and having sex with her after she's dead .
my mom was in the house the whole time ...
fuck ...
she was only 15 .
holy shit .
you know , it really messed with her head .
after that she only hanged out with guys who'd beat the hell out of her
and then , when i was little , she'd get drunk , and she'd drag me and my brother out of the bed at four in the morning , and she had all the news , clippings , about my grandpa , and she'd read them over and over again ...
then , i knew every word before kindergarden ...
i think that's how i learned to read .
she's gone .
we should go .
that chick ali gave me a blowjob last night , and i fucked her .
she called again , sais you all going back to weston ...
marty?
yeah , man , that's the plan .
you going on?
you're my best friend .
okay , so , we're picking marty up in 45 minutes .
derek , what's up with the baseball bat?
cmon , we need more weapons .
what's going on?
i dont know .
my mom'd say something?
no .
it's just ...
nevermind , everything's ok .
my back hurts .
derek , would you give me a masage?
me too , my back hurts too ...
i want a masage .
harder .

i mean it's " crazymotherfucker " , it's like the godfather ...
crazy motherfucker ...
what , to kill a guy?
yeah .
maybe if you hit him right .
like in the back of his head or some shit?
back , front , dont matter ... you just have to hit him hard enough .
you cant just smash the motherfucker ...
you gotta really wack him .
it's not like you're in a fight , and you're really mad at him .
you're not trying to hurt this fucker , you're trying to kill him .
i've got something else .

bobby , this is marty puccio .
i called you .
you asked me to call when i got home , so i'm calling ...

i guess ...
you stabbed him in the heart , you were on top of him ... ... he was on his back .
no shit lis ', i got that mafia guy with a baseball bat telling me what to fuckin 'do every minute .
yeah , that's true .
i mean , i guess they'd say he did it .
no shit lis ', the guy blasted his fuckin brains out with a ball bat .
oh , shit ... !
that was so gross ! .
it was so sick ! .
you think i could get in trouble?
for what?
for being there ... like an accessory .
they could say you were a witness or smth , but that's about it .
that's no big deal .
so , how do you feel?
what , about getting caught?
shit , it's like a heavy weight got lifted off me .
we did it .

hell no , i didnt have shit to do with it .
but i was , like , there , so some would consider that i was a witness or some shit ...
and i dont know , man , like maybe you know that something like this happened , and dont tell the cops than maybe they have some fuckin law , that can get you in trouble , you know
like leaving the scene of an accident , without never reporting it ... you know
they have that in driver's aid .
i know .
shit ! .
it's just ... i need an alibi , man .
no , i wasnt anywhere near those assholes that night ... anywhere near them ...

marty stuck him right in the heart ...
lisa , what are you talking about?

he stuck him right in the back of his fuckin head .
lisa ... what? !
it was so weird ... this hitman , right , he takes this baseball bat and right when bobby's on the ground , he's like gurgling like a baby , shootin blood and his guts were like , hanging out of him ...
it was so sick , his eyes were like popping out of his head ...
he just takes his baseball bat and he swings it ... it was half way into his head .
you watched this?
yeah , i was there , and ali and heather ... we were all there
we saw it ... most of it
heather ... you met her , right?
she's so strange ...
you know , she gets this blank look like she's not even there ... and she starts huggin her knees
like shes totally fright .

lisa ...
yeah , listen , claudia
i'm real worried about how we left him , he's just out there where anyone can see him ,
i cant stop thinkin about it ... you know ,
like someone's just walking there , finding him ...
we shoud've pushed him into the canal more ,
at least the gators would've got him , or he would've sunk or something but
that's why i came over .
what? !
well , claudy , i need to go out there , can i borrow your mother's car?
i need a ride
i need someone to help me move it .

i didnt say i murdered anybody .
they killed him .
i didnt even say they murdered him , i mean , he was fighting back
he was?
i'm sorry .
please i'll do anything , just dont kill me .
and then right when he said that , marty just walked up to him , and wacked him in the heart with his knife .
the whole thing was just totally totally extreme .
wait ... you want somebody to take you out there to move the body?
anybody that's crazy enough to do that ...

would it?
well ... i dont know the law , but i dont think so .
i think you'd still have to say who you were ...

why wouldnt it count?
you'd still say ... you reported it , right?
ali , are you talking about a murder murder?
i guess .
this guy kinda got killed .
