yeah , but it didn't .
stevie knows .
the guy's lucky .
alderman .
inspector rimgale .
i ... need to get in that trunk .
oh , excuse me .
thanks .
pretty fancy shoes you're wearing for a fire scene .
guess you haven't been to many fires .
we wanted to talk to you about alan seagrave's death .
we still haven't gotten a fire report .
you'll get that answer as soon as i do , ma'am .
a man gets stuffed through the windshield of his own car .
is that an accident or arson?
people are asking me .
i gotta tell 'em something .
we're starting to get the feeling your office is dragging out this case ... to embarrass the alderman because of his fire department cutbacks .
i have an uncomplicated job : to decide if a fire is arson .
if so , to catch the son of a bitch doing it .
if my investigative methods happen to muck up ... the campaign of certain mayor wanna be's ,
i gotta tell you ,
i'm not going to lose any sleep over it .
i'm sure you're gonna have that report on my desk as soon as it's ready .
you'll have it .
thank you .
that guy better not make any rights on reds in my district .
hey , swayzak?
you missed it .
get over there .
keep 'em busy .
you should've been there .
it was fucking great !
we almost lost a whole goddamn company for you .
since you shut down 33 , there's no fucking backup .
we appreciate it .
i don't know about the rest ,
but you got my vote for mayor .
if you have a problem , help us .
work with the task force .
the task force?
three guys have died because of cuts made by your fucking task force !
know that little glow that's starting to blink in the corner of your eye?
that's your career dissipation light .
it went into overtime .
come on , man .
no .
if anybody's lights are about to go out , believe me , they're yours .
thanks a lot , fellas .
you did a great job today , by the way .
alderman , will this affect your task force findings?
no more today .
good bye .
so this is that big city job you were talking about .
yeah .
welcome home , brian .
where's that fucking guy buy his shoes?
did you check those out?
they're like fucking butter .
yoo hoo !
hey , g man !
get outta here .
do you have to do that?
yeah .
could you believe that fire?
there we were , adcox and me ... pulling that lady right out of the fire's fucking throat .
we saved a life , man !
whoo hoo hoo !
i love it here !
fighting 17th !
goddamn !
stephen's amazing .
you see how he took that fire?
by the balls !
i'm gonna be that good someday .
you watch .
you'll see .
you know what stephen said to me?
when the shit was coming hard , he said , " you never know ... till the moment the fire stares you down ...
if you're just gonna do this job " or be great at it , right?
he using that line of shit on you now?
you think he made that little gem up?
my old man used to use that line every other day .
it's no line , man !
that's no line .
hey , kid , we ain't waitin '!
go , go , go !
let's go !
no , no , not that way !
what's going on?
come on .
let's go !
it's lunch , probies !
let's get started !
ooo , caw , caw !
a couple of crows , man !
that money will probably end up coming from
this better be good .
or we feed you to the thing .
shut up .
you got something against dalmatians?
accident or murder?
that's the question arson investigators are struggling with ... after a freak explosion known by firefighters as a backdraft
hey , pengelly , you're on tv .
i saw you too !
look , that's me .
he's been identified as alan seagrave , a prominent chicago c. p. a.
despite pressure from the city council , fire officials refuse to speculate on the cause , saying only that their investigation is continuing .
gentlemen , gentlemen .
here he goes again .
as 17th's official toastmaster
and bullshitter .
thank you , santos .
did i mention you were cut out of my will?
i think it appropriate ... that we recognize the two asswipes ... probationary firemen , among us today , who were officially baptized ... into the world of old man fire .
first , to tim .
despite the fact he was born with a dull expression ... and a really hideous pair of ears , he not only took on the beast , but pulled from its clutches , assisted by a more famous and brilliant firefighter ... me , a kicking and screaming civilian ... who'll probably wind up suing us for breaking her fingernails .
and to brian .
help me , santos .
whose own contribution ... was both more beautiful and less likely to sue us .
son of a bitch .
when i heard that both mccaffrey brothers ... were being assigned here at this station at the same time , my heart was filled with a ... sudden desire to transfer .
so raise a glass , lads , to funny looking tim and the mccaffrey brothers .
for despite the fact ... they've gotten on each other's nerves for years , have managed with great effort to still be pissed off at each other .
gentlemen ...
fuck you !
# war , yeah #
# what is it good for absolutely nothing #
# say it again , y'all war , look out #
# what is it good for absolutely nothing #
# listen to me ohh war #
# i despise 'cause it means #
thanks for the ride .
hey , brian .
i'll see you tonight , huh?
yeah , i'll see you tonight .
i've known jack fitzgerald since he was a candidate .
they had fire engines then?
get that man's name !
i gotta say , he was just as ugly then .
can i have a beer , please?
hey .
how you doin '?
hey . ... home of the real firemen .
enough of us stroking each other .
here's the man we're here to honor ,
chief jack fitzgerald .
i know i speak for everybody here .
it's about time you retired ... and made a promotion for somebody else .
think i oughta change the view .
i couldn't have wished for a better life .
thank you much .
i don't believe this shit !
pretty boy , get a load of this .
bull , wait'll you listen to this shit .
let me see .
hey hey hey .
probationary fireman , brian mccaffrey , on his first fire , showed the bravery and courage of a veteran ... when he risked life and limb to ...
double check a burning floor , alone .
emerging victoriously with anna rodriquez , a seamstress for the north shore clothing company .
axe , get a load of this shit !
mccaffrey first gained prominence as the subject ... of a 1972 pulitzer prize winning photograph taken ...
at the scene of his father's death .
that's me .
what are we gonna do about this?
hey , 17 , what's going on?
well ...
i think that it's union bylaw ... that if you get your picture in the paper , even if it's bullshit ,
you buy the whole company a drink .
all right !
i know i'm gonna have another double ... on the hero !
give him a hand over here .
what's this?
leave 'em alone .
good job .
# [ irish jig ]
brian mccaffrey , huh?
brian , this is my boss , alderman swayzak .
he wanted to meet you .
you should be proud of helping to save that woman's life .
that was a hell of a job .
don't believe everything you read .
don't be so modest , brian .
see that?
that's a mannequin .
look , brian ,
let me just get down to it , okay?
i've been checking you out .
jennifer can't say enough .
i need your help .
i'm gonna offer you a job .
i've already got a job .
the great thing about this job , it's still with the fire department .
one of your best investigators , don rimgale , is working a really tough case .
he needs an extra pair of hands .
if that name is gonna come from my office ,
i want it to be you .
why is that?
i want someone from a real traditional fire fighting clan .
yeah , we got all kinds of traditions ...
like dying young .
thanks anyway .
took you all of 30 seconds to blow that off .
brian , i know it's not my place to say this , but i think you're passing on a great opportunity .
you're smarter than that .
look , jen .
i'm trying to do something here .
can't you see that?
i'm trying to be a fireman , not some kind of poster boy for swayzak .
there's gotta be at least 500 other smoke eaters here ... that do that shit for real every day .
why don't you tell swayzak to talk to one of them?

sean and me .
we could just float .

and it was dad's way .
maybe it's not everybody's way .
dad's way?
he tell you that in a fucking seance , huh?
you said you needed to know something .
what did you learn today , huh?

time to move on?
you're right .
you win , stephen .
you're the best .

well , great !
that's great , really great news .
the alderman'll be thrilled that you're working with us .
marty's a good man , brian .
yeah .
so stop me if i got this wrong .
the fire's almost out , you're upstairs on the unburned floor ...

now the itch starts .
the glory boy flash starts .
i'm a hero .
heroes don't stand around .
you can tell me .
that's what it was?
yes , sir .
so you punched out a window for ventilation .
was that before or after you noticed you were standing in a lake of gasoline?
was that before or after you noticed ... you were standing in a lake of gasoline , you idiot?
before , sir .
you could have burned , killed , or crispered half that company .
you wrecked the physical evidence that i use to prove that it's arson .
you know how goddamn hard it is to determine the cause .
now go home and you think about that .
i'll have to call him back .
excuse me .
yeah?
brian mccaffrey , your new assistant .
oh , dennis 'kid .
why don't you go find a corner to hide in?
i'll get to you later .
i don't wanna deal with you now .
great .
you still standing there?
i think we should get something straight here now .
i was assigned to this office by the city .
you better get used to me .
i know who you were assigned by .
i knew your father too .
he was a hell of a fireman .
he had a hell of a reputation .
but it don't cut slack here as far as i'm concerned .
swayzak sends you here , fine .
i gotta eat you .
those are rules .
i got nothin 'to say about that .
swayzak or no , you work for me now .
step outta line , make one false move , you're outta here .
don't think you're the first .
let's go .
where we goin '?
pest control .
# shadow , shadow #
hi , shadow .
hi , ronald .
how ya doin '?
stayin 'comfortable?
i didn't think you would make it .
i wouldn't miss this .
who's that?
he works for me .
is he a fireman?
i like firemen .
you like everybody , ronald .
brian mccaffrey .
yeah , sure .
no , that's stephen .
he's the little one with the hat .
oh , what a treat !
hey , do i know you?
your dad did .
who the hell is this guy?
nah , put it away .
come on , shadow .
he lost his dad to the animal and ... you didn't even tell him who he was coming to see?
tell him .
let me tell you about ronald .
ronald likes telephones .
likes to tape wooden matches to the bell strikers ... and then wrap it in cotton with gasoline .
had a whole little thing goin ', huh?
and when you got bored?
what'd you do?
he started makin 'calls .
never proved .
tell him about us down on state street .
nah .
nobody cares about that one .
it was your basic warehouse torch i was doin 'for the owner .
i mean , they were a cakewalk .
i just
i just lost my concentration and my animal turned on me .
got the whole place going like hell .
my hair was on fire , my hands , everything .
i was dead .
then suddenly i was alive .
i was pulled out of there ... by my hero , my shadow here .
except , he didn't see this big tub of phosphorous , did you?
explosion lit him up so bright , left his shadow on the wall .
still shy about rolling up your sleeves , shadow?
show him your stomach .
the funny thing about firemen , night and day , they're always firemen .
ronald bartel .
all right , the parole board has received ...
mr. bartel's fitness report , his i. d. 44 , endorsement from his section warden .
dr. norris?
as supervising psychiatrist , i would describe ...
mr. bartel's progress as remarkable .
taking into account his disability and the six years ... he's already served , i recommend a parole .
mr. bartel , do you regret your crimes?
yes , and and i'm aware of the pain that i have caused .
if released , will you commit these crimes again?
no .
no , i won't .
do you consider yourself ready for society?
yes , i do .
yeah , right , ronald .
you're ready , all right .
excuse me .
excuse me .
shadow .
remember this?
remember this , ronald?
remember who it belonged to?
mm hmm .
what did you do to that little girl?
it's not fair , shadow .
what did you do to that little girl?
i burned her .
you burned her .
what do you do to old ladies , ronald?
burn them .
and what about the world , ronald?
what would you like to do with the whole world?
burn it all .
see ya next year , ronald .
we figured the body's the owner , some guy named cosgrove .
weird blast , though , like that other guy ... who went through the windshield of his own car .
explosion blew out the flame before the engine got here .
good for us ; not too good for him .
bring the toolbox .
tim , get the hot spots .
you in the cheap seats , watch it .
there's brian .
well , let's go .
hey , mccaffrey , need a special invitation?
come on .
charge the line , axe .
what do you want me to do with this?
shhh .
we got heavy smoke stains observed in entry room .
smoke demarcation line is very low .
fire never got hot enough here to cook the soot off .
come on , you sneaky little son of a bitch .
come on .
tell me where you came from .
point me where you started .
come on .
burn indicators distended toward northern wall .
less soot here , more heat .
lack of discoloration in shattered glass ... indicates slow burn before explosion .
there's some little dead rat critters here .
fire originated in this room .
took its time .
hung out .
the air ran out .
it couldn't breathe .
it was snuffed .
but it wasn't dead .
must have been all that trapped heat lying low , waiting for some sucker to give it one big gulp of air .
another backdraft .
this is our point of origin .
let me have a crowbar .
no sign of accelerants .
well , if it's arson , somebody figured a new way to hide it .
okay , we got alan seagrave ... and donald cosgrove .
both deaths due to close encounters ... with stationary objects .
we have an office door for cosgrove ... and , oh , an '87 porsche for seagrave .
no nonrelevant traumas .
no significant blood toxicology .
attitude of both trajectories are consistent with explosion .
they ran the residue you scraped from both front doors .
it's a combination of plumber's putty and rayophene gum .
it burns almost completely away when you light it .
so it was on both doors?
yeah .
something else i want to show you .
you're gonna have to help me .
mccaffrey , why don't you come over and help us?
no , i don't think so .
not in my contract .
i just rewrote your contract .
come on over and help us .
anyway , here , we're gonna have to lift him .
great .
christ , he's not gonna sell you insurance .
just lift him up .
hold on .
you see that patch of shirt right there?
we wondered about the discoloration .
so i scraped a piece off and ran a spectro on it .
on a lucky shot , we picked up traces of something .
what was it?
ah , trychtichlorate .
nobody around here ever heard of it .
yeah , trychtichlorate .
it eats magnesium .
it's an absorption catalyst used in toxic waste accidents .
it's rare .
they stopped making it a couple of years ago .
we figured it got in his clothes in a gas state from the fire .
what was it doing in the fire?
that's your job .
okay !
stephen , what what are you doing here?
just fixin 'my roof .
you've gotta stop just showing up on the roof like this .
look , i just i wanted to , i don't know , not exactly ... apologize for the other night , especially since ...
i don't remember much .
you remember .
yeah , i know .
i just wanted to say , i don't know , something .
the great communicator .
so what's going on , stephen?
you only bang on the roof when you got something on your mind .
how's brian doing?
he's out .
he quit .
he just up and quit for no reason?
i don't care what you heard , helen , i treated him better ... than any other probie i ever had .
all right?
he probably hates my guts ... but at least he finally took a look in the mirror .
so once again , stephen's right and somebody else is wrong .
you always gotta be right .
that's such bullshit .
yeah?
why?
because i'm the first to admit it when i'm wrong .
yeah?
how often does that happen?
in a fire?
never !
he would have bought it , helen .
i'm telling ya , maybe not today , maybe not next year ; but it would have happened .
all right?
he's my brother .
i couldn't just
you just couldn't live with that .
mccaffrey .
yeah?
take the top off .
holy shit !
that's it .
that's it .
son of a bitch !
this guy is different .
he don't love fire .
who?
the killer .
he used magnesium to make it look like an accident .
i got it after we went to see ronald .
torchers want to fry the whole goddamn world .
but the fires that killed those guys never burned up that much .
the trychtichlorate hid the magnesium in the plug , but it burned slow .
and he made his burns backdrafts .
but he killed these guys .
could have killed everybody .
backdraft blew out the flame .
that's it .
that's the reason .
what reason?
why backdrafts .
whoever fried seagrave and cosgrove ... went to a hell of a lot of trouble to make sure they died by fire .
they also made sure that the fire blew itself out .
so that's why they used the putty in the doors .
what do we got?
a torch with a conscience?
no .
we got a stone killer trying to make a point .
you can make the call now .
it's arson , right?
i'm not calling anyone yet .
you can't rush this .
i've seen it too many times before .
i wanna make sure this torch doesn't walk .
we're gonna wait .
well , well , mr. mccaffrey .
welcome aboard .
nice boat you got here .
what?
you mean mine?
well , not yet .
glad to have you as part of the team , brian .
let's get a picture with mr. mccaffrey and myself .
you look good .
yeah , there you go .
thanks .
hi .
yeah , have fun now .
great night , isn't it?
who is that?
larry dewaay .
come on .
larry , how are ya?
hey .
yeah .
how's the job going?
okay .
yeah? ls rimgale getting any better?
rimgale's rimgale .
he's just doing his job .
doing his job?
he hasn't done anything .
at this rate , he won't declare it's arson before he retires .
will you get me out of here?
otherwise i'm gonna have to go and pick her up .
this is it , one of the oldest fire stations in the city .
what do you think?
it's homey .
shhh !
the guys are sleeping upstairs .
you're gonna get me in trouble .
this is my office .
impressive , huh?
yes , it's very nice .
lot of tradition locked up in this old house .
see those doors?
they lead to the hay loft when they used to have the old horse drawn engines .
lot different then .
but kind of the same , you know?
do you miss it?
you seem like you do .
well , when i came back ,
i , uh i knew .
i knew that i really wanted to be a fireman .
then why'd you quit?
i should have said i wanted to be a good one .
so show me your fire truck .
shhh !
mask up , lads .
bring that sledge .
where is it?
i don't know .
there's alarms goin 'off on three floors .
this alarm system's been screwing up since they built
10?
29?
yeah .
how do we know if the floor's gonna be on fire?
well , when the doors open , if it's hot ,
don't get out .
we're gonna start on this side .
i'll meet you down at the end .
all right , come on .
come on .
high rise gigs give me the creeps .
bull , we're early on this one again ... and it ain't even broke out yet .
we're one short with brian gone .
wait for the next in engines .
let's catch it before it breaks out .
you want to learn something?
yeah , i do .
axe , go with pengelly .
take the other side .
don't split us up again .
it ain't safe .
i haven't got time for this .
then let me take the lead .
do your job ; they need a line .
come on .
come on , axe .
oh , you're so very sly ; but , so am i.
she's hot and smoky ... but she's not rollin 'yet .
shit !
hello , 51 .
you follow 17 in the truck .
11201 south clark .
it's a cancel .
11021 south clark .
south clark .
what time is it , anyway?
all right , take it .
wait , wait .
make sure you check it first .
oh , yeah .
howdy , boys .
brian !
here we go .
now get that mask back on .
right .
clear !
stay here .
check that door for heat , tim?
tim !
watch out , steve .
i got him .
move off .
put it out !
stretcher !
get the goddamn stretcher .
everybody over here .
through here .
through here .
get that stretcher over here .
what the hell happened?
tim !
tim !
how'd it happen?
breathe , tim , breathe .
get him in there !
come on !
you're all right .
come on !
hang on , kid !
hey , shadow , i got one here .
oh , christ .
some guy named holcomb .
steve .
steve .
steve , you all right?
how is he?
he's alive .
is he gonna make it?
they're not saying .
he's in there .
i'm sorry .
you can't come in now .
please stay outside .
i should have been there .
none of us should have been there , brian .
don't tell me about the chance i'm taking .
you were costing me time .
you didn't wait for back up .
you were wrong .
what the hell is your trouble?
this part of your investigation?
you had to do it .
you had to be myth man , taking another fire bare handed ...
instead of looking out for the probie .
we need space .
is that what happened?
i had that fire .
he didn't listen .
he's a candidate , your responsibility .
you shouldn't have had him up there in the first place .
you burned him , stephen .
fuck you .
don't you walk away from me .
yo , brian .
let's go .
goddamn it !
get him off !
come on !
easy , man .
loosen up !
you're just making things worse .
relax .
forget about it .
come on .
come on .
inspector .
alderman .
chinese sponge cake?
when are you gonna catch the prick that's doing this , don?
don?
don't you have any leads?
no , marty , i don't .
we haven't found any connection between the victims at all .
jesus christ .
open your eyes .
you got seagrave , cosgrove ...
and now holcomb .
holcomb?
put 'em together .
it's a goddamn list .
i didn't know the name of that victim had been released?
hey , john .
morning .
i'll do whatever you want me to do .
i want to help you nail that son of a bitch that burned tim .
show me how .
thought old marty was acting a little strange .
he's right .
there's residue .
holcomb is the third victim .
the backdraft was set up somewhere in there .
fried holcomb when he opened the inner door .
but the outer door held and it waited for tim .
in a word , brian , what is this job all about?
fire .
it's a living thing , brian .
it breathes , it eats , and it hates .
the only way to beat it ... is to think like it ; to know this flame will spread this way across the door ... and up across the ceiling ; not because of the physics of flammable liquids , but because it wants to .
some guys , fire owns 'em .
makes 'em fight it on its level .
the only way to truly kill it ... is to love it a little , just like ronald .
hi .
hi .
i heard your friend's gonna be okay .
thanks .
we checked and your boss was partners ... with all the murder victims in a company called lakeside dynamics .
he's keeping that a secret .
i wanna know why .
i don't know anything about that .
you might be able to find out .
get me his files .
do you know what you're asking?
yeah .
four years ago i was punching a cash register .
two years ago , marty swayzak didn't even know my name .
i was bringing the guy coffee .
i practically run that office now .
and marty he believes in me .
i just don't
you're asking me to throw that all away .
your boss is a liar .
stephen?
i'm sorry , helen .
i just couldn't sleep .
well , what's wrong?
it used to be real clear .
when i was a kid , what meant most to me about this job was ... no " ifs .
somebody called the fire department , we came .
we just showed up .
those guys , they just don't know how much i love 'em .
you don't leave people hangin '.
it holds everything up , doesn't it?
loyalty .
i don't get it .
till death do us part . " isn't that what you heard , helen?
you go , we go .
it's all the same ... piece of shit without that , isn't it?
it's the end of everything .
i'm sorry i came .
there's just nobody i can talk to .
i really miss you .
you sure you really want to put grape jelly in the eggs?
yeah , it's part of my formula .
it's an experiment .
it's an experiment?
yeah .
let's get these eggs going .
hey , i want to do that .
can you do it?
that's good .
i'll put that in the formula .
you gonna leave the shells?
yeah .
they're part of the formula?
yeah .
i guess you know what you're doing .
i know what i'm doing .
uh oh .
mom !
i didn't know you'd be up so early .
mom , go back to bed .
we're making you breakfast in bed .
stephen , can i talk to you a minute?
yeah .
you keep going there .
you're doing good .
he knows what he's doin '.
he told me he likes those piano lessons you got him taking .
it's just i don't want to confuse him , you know .
i knew who you were when we got married .
i knew how you did things .
and
i mean , you haven't
i just can't anymore .
i just you know ,
i gotta worry about sean .
yeah .
i mean , you're the best .
you really are .
but the chances that you take just
you scare me now .
sean .
listen , i , uh
i blew it .
i forgot that i gotta work this morning .
so , um
that's all right .
we'll just do it again next saturday .
all right?
mom's crying .
the latest polls came in , marty .
marty?
jesus christ , marty .
what's going on?
we have a city planners meeting in 15 minutes .
marty .
you've gotta level with me , marty .
is there something about these deaths you're not telling me?
no .
what's this?
just take it .
rimgale's gonna wanna talk to swayzak about this .
i'm sorry .
that's a dumb thing to say .
you're right .
good bye , brian .
what the hell you do with this thing?
what do you mean?
i drove it , joe .
this is a copy of swayzak's report that we know is bullshit ; but we could never argue with the numbers because they're airtight .
this file she gave you proves it's phoney .
i checked on the firm that recommended the cuts to swayzak's task force .
they've done exactly one job , a manpower study .
i checked further and it's not even a company .
no employees ... nothing .
just a p. o. box .
i wonder who wrote that report .
someone who knows how to work numbers .
exactly .
like a bunch of dead financial wizards .
seagrave , holcomb , cosgrove  and swayzak .
why did he go through this trouble to cut firehouses?
when a firehouse closes , swayzak converts it into a community center .
that's sweet .
lakeside dynamics , remember them?
they get all the expensive construction work .
i'm telling you , this is a total scam .
these guys were making a ton of money .
it's time we had a little talk with mr. swayzak .
let's go .
mr. swayzak?
gas .
check in there .
aaah !
come on .
come on !
let's go .
come on !
hey , kid .
i think i've got a problem here .
is it true that you were rescued by the fire department's arson team?
that's quite a bunch of guys , huh?
i'm so goddamn helpless here .
i can't do a fucking thing .
what do you want me to do?
i've been lying here thinkin '.
for hours ... thinkin 'and thinkin 'and thinkin '.
we're close .
we're close .
but we're not lookin 'in the right place , not in the right place .
so , you've come to pick ronald's brains ... because nobody knows the animal like ronald .
it must've looked like it was going to be ... a medium deal , didn't it , when your father bought it?
what?
did you watch him when he made that ballsy jump and saved
i didn't come to talk about my father .
i sent away for a copy of that " life magazine " ... with your picture on the cover .
it's a collectible .
who's doing this , ronald?
wrong question .
who isn't?
it isn't a spark , is it?
because there isn't enough damage ... and he wouldn't have had any fun .
it isn't an insurance pro because there isn't any profit .
who does that leave us with?
what's his tool?
how does he do it?
how does he talk to the fire?
the outlets .
no .
that's a probie .
that's beneath you , brian .
trychtichlorate .
very good .
very good .
you still haven't put it together?
i have .
then who , ronald?
you wanna know who?
i wanna know ... if this kid really wanted to be ... just like his dad .
did he?
okay .
i'm outta here .
all right !
i wanted to be him , okay?
i wanted to be him more than anything .
you loved him .
yeah .
you watched him dance with the animal .
you saw your dad burn .
fuck you , ronald !
who the hell's doin 'this?
did it look at you?
did the fire look at you?
it did .
ohhh .
our worlds aren't that far apart , are they?
so ... whoever did this , really knows the animal well , don't they?
they know him real well but they won't let him loose .
they won't let him have fun so they don't love him .
who doesn't love fire ... and is around trychtichlorate all day long?
oh , my god !
that wasn't such a long walk after all , was it?
oh , god .
goddamn it , stephen .
hey , what's goin 'on?
i just came by to see how you were doing?
how am i doin '?
well , i'm sellin 'dad's boat .
guy comin 'by in a few minutes to take a look at it .
what are you gonna do?
i mean , where you going?
i didn't say i was goin 'anywhere .
look , i gotta i gotta get back .
there's somethin 'i'm supposed to do .
what?
what do you gotta do?
look at you .
look at your face !
all the things you must be thinkin '.
you really hate my guts , don't you?
you know something , brian?
that's all right .
maybe we should talk abou  you don't like me ... because i was no genius in the way i raised you .
is that it?
dad was gone !
what was i supposed to do?
you tell me .
forget it .
it's okay .
i tried .
i wanted so many things for you ... that i couldn't even hope for .
because after that , i had no choices !
well , i'm not your father .
you got somewhere to go , go .
people change , huh , brian?
sometimes right when you're lookin 'at 'em .
what's going on with you?
i don't know .
do you?
i gotta go .
roaring fire ]
attention , all units responding .
this is gonna be a hazardous materials response at a chemical plant .
stephen?
has stephen gotten back yet?
he just pulled up .
is it adcox?
how do you know?
i didn't until you came to the boat lookin 'for those chemicals .
lookin 'for me .
what were they doing on the boat?
axe gave 'em to me .
they're cleaning shit .
we gotta roll !
i'll be there in a minute .
i gotta go to rimgale with this .
they're pullin 'a box .
i'll be there !
stephen !
wait !
i'm his lieutenant .
i'll handle it .
stephen?
are you a part of this?
no .
you're sure?
that's the only thing i am sure of anymore .
bull , we need you .
jesus christ !
stephen !
stephen !
shit !
get out of the way !
you all right?
you all right , peng?
everybody all right?

we're pullin 'the plug .
everybody off the roof , now !
jesus christ , axe .
you don't understand .
my cousin , sally , used to work at swayzak's office .
she saw the files .
she saw what he did .
you set me up with those chemicals?
i'm tryin 'to explain .
stephen .
you back off !
axe .
somebody had to stop these pricks .
are you thinkin '?
you burned people !
you didn't see .
you're a fireman .
when sally showed me swayzak's files
i should've let you in on it .
in on murder?
those assholes were closin 'firehouses , gettin 'our friends killed for money .
i had to do it for the department !
for tim?
that was an accident .
did you start that fire?
why'd you have to go in there so fucking early?
that's why you wanted me to wait .
let me finish swayzak !
no .
it's over .
your dad would puke if he saw how you shit on his department .
what would he say about what you do?
your dad died ... saving my life , and these people were killin 'firemen for money .
swayzak .
he killed our friends for money .
what the fuck would you do?
you're his lieutenant .
you've gotta handle this .
it's going !
get to the side !
it's gonna go !
17 !

honor guard , dismissed !
gentlemen , can we help you?
police .
we have a subpoena for alderman swayzak .
ah , inspector  alderman swayzak , how are you doin '?
this will only take a minute .
i'm in a press conference .
these detectives would like to question you why you secretly paid ...
donald cosgrove , jeffrey holcomb , and alan seagrave ... to create a phony manpower study .
ask him who made money off firemen dying .
you see that glow flashing in the corner of your eye?
that's your career dissipation light .
it just went into high gear .
i'll have my aides look into it as soon as they can .
thank you .
mr. alderman has no further comment .
this conference is over .

# you sit there with a blank expression #
# say you can't go on anymore #
# it's not like me to come out and help you #
# maybe i've been down this road before #
# been livin 'in the shadows #
# now you come out slow #
# now you're in the saddle #
# got to ride alone #
# now the dream is shattered #
# those days are few #
# maybe something mattered #
# it's not just for you #
# some are gonna go for broke #
# some will lay down #
# i've been too long standing still #
# all i know is whenever you need me #
# you reach out and set me in motion #
# lookin 'out on that lonely valley #
# you're tellin 'me i've come so far #
# you're the reason i finally got there #
# you're the reason it's been so hard #
# been livin 'in the shadows #
# now you hear the call #
# now you're in the saddle #
# you got to ride or fall #
# now you push a little harder #
# like i showed you to #
# 'cause the day'll be comin 'they will look to you #
# some are gonna go for broke #
# some will lay down #
# i've been too long standing still #
# all i know is whenever you need me #
# you reach out and set me in motion #
# some are gonna go for broke #
# some will lay down #
# i've been too long standing still #
# all i know is whenever you need me #
# you reach out and set me in motion #
# some are gonna go for broke #
# some will lay down #
# i've been too long standing still #
# i will pick you up whenever you stumble #
# you reach out and set me in motion #
