that's tough .
that's tough .
see , now the problem is ,
i was married , my wife hated me being a firefighter , we got divorced nine months later .
you're different , you are a good father , you worry .
but you should worry .
you know , maybe it's time for a change of your scenery?
i was thinking there's a job down at headquarters , head position , do you like me to put your name in for?
are you saying i ain't go to the firehouse?
well , i'm saying that you should ask yourself that question .
maybe go home talk to linda .
you know , be honest with yourself?
nothing wrong with moving on .
i did it .
so what did he say?
mike may have me transferred .
what does that mean for us?
i'll be home nights .
70 cents an hour increase to pay .
is that what you want?
i don't know .
it's been so crazy lately .
you know , our kids are scared .
i see you upset and ... that's terrible .
so this is about me and the kids again , is it?
we're married ten years , when you do this , it's hard for me sometimes .
and i do get scared .
but i deal with it .
i'm proud of you .
you know , mike asked me tonight , if i still love the job the way i did .
and the first time in my life .
i didn't know what to say .

mike?
tell linda i love her .
that i loved her from second i saw her .
do you hear me?
yeah , i hear you .
promise to take care of my kids .
tell them that i'll be always with them .
you tell them that , do you hear me?
i will .
command all units evacuate building immediately .
all units reporting clear , the building is clear , we're all out .
copy that .
it's never an easy thing .
saying good bye to a brother firefighter .
and this time is particularly difficult for me because i watched jack growing to a one of the finest firefighters i've ever known .
he joined this department because he wanted to help people .
who knows how many homes is still standing because jack was there .
how many lives were spared .
he gave his life for that cause .
we'll never forget you , jack .
and we are better for ever knowing you .
but i make you this one promise , tomorrow we will be back on the truck .
because you was the bravest of the brave .
how is it that firefighters run to a burning building , when everyone else is running out?
jack , he would answer that question by saving another man's life .
your courage is the answer .
and today we will be as brave as you .
i'm not mourning you , i'm celebrating your life .
so i'd like everyone to stand up and celebrate the life of jack morrison .
