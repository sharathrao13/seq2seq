when you say people , you mean living people?
i apply for a research position in the neurology lab .
we have an x ray room .
this is a chronic hospital .
the position is for staff neurologist .
you will be working with people .
a doctor , doctor .
any patients at the carmel institute?
earthworms .
sorry?
it was an immense project .
i was to extract 1 decigram myelin
from 4 tons of earthworms .
i worked on that for 5 years , everyone else said it could not be done .
it cannot .
i know that now .
i proved it .
maybe before .. . at st thomas?
all research?
we are understaffed ...
he has never worked with human beings ...
excuse me , you are looking for someone with a clinical background .
as much as i need a job , there must be 100 more suitable applicants .
how about medical school?
you could not graduate without some clinical experience .
you took a pulse , a temperature .
you did diagnosis .
there you have it , then .
you do want the job , do you not?
this way , doc ...
you spend much time in a chronic hospital?
you would remember .
i guess not , then .
we have m. s. , tourette syndrome , parkinson's disease
some of them we have not got a name for .
what are they waiting for?
nothing .
how will they get well?
they will not .
they are chronic .
we call it the garden because all we do is feed and water them .
mr kean?
can i ask ...
i was born 1 91 1 in kingsbridge , new york .
i came here in july 1955 .
prior to that , i was at brooklyn psychiatric center .
prior to that , i was a person .
it gets easier .
you do not think it will , but it does .
no , buttercup ...
go to your house .
good morning , doctor ...
i have a new arrival for you .
she was brought in late last night .
here is her file .
hello , i am dr sayer .
do you know where you are?
can you hear me?
medical insurance?
her name is lucy fishman .
she was found with her sister
many days after her sister died .
she has no living relatives .
she has always been as she is now .
with no response or comprehension .
and yet ...
a reflex .
if she batted it away , but she did not .
as you can see , she caught it .
it is still a reflex .
if you were right , i would agree .
it is as if , having lost her own will , she borrows the will of the ball .
the will of the ball?
excuse me .
you are trying to make a good impression , that is it , right?
you are still settling in .
miss costello , see to it that dr sayer's waiting patients
are rescheduled for tomorrow .
borrows the will of the ball?
that is great .
okay , thank you .
let us know if she catches anything else .
i will be fired .
it is all right , i will go back to school .
did i forget something?
no , i wanted to say that i preferred your explanation .
i will look after things for you until you have settled in .
good night , doctor .
thank you .
hello , i am dr sayer .
i am waheedah .
how are you today?
fine , thank you ...
yes , sorry .
what form?
yes , i will hold .
okay .
three , one , two .
thank you .
bye .
hello .
yipee !
we are in orbit .
now we can try being weightless .
let us celebrate with delicious nestle's quick .
nestle's chocolate flavour is out of this world .
hello up there , time to recharge with delicious nestle's quick .
lucy ...
you are out ...
anthony , would you help me ... move this?
excuse me .
lucy , you are almost there .
here is the water , lucy .
i wonder why your nails grow so fast?
it must be all that jello they give you .
jello , jello , day after day .
red jello , yellow jello , every day jello .
i forgot to tell you , mrs cooper passed away .
remember her?
she was nice .
always a kind word .
her dog i could have done without .
excuse me?
hello .
does he ever speak to you?
of course not .
not in words .
he speaks to you in other ways?
how do you mean?
you do not have children .
no .
if you did , you would know .
it says " atypical schizophrenia " .
atypical hysteria " , this one .
atypical nerve impairment " .
no change since last examination .
no change or therapy recommended .
very nice .
this one is " no change " , dated 9l1 1 l44 .
that is 25 years .
at a point all these atypical somethings ought to amount to a typical something .
but a typical what?
doctor , do you want to go for a cup of coffee or something?
tea?
normally , i would say yes , but i made other plans .
some other time .
yes .
encephalitis lethargica " .
where is it?
sorry , i thought someone had left the light on .
i found the connection .
they all survived encephalitis
years before they came here .
see?
in the 1920's .
is it not wonderful?
yes , i will come back later .
how many have you found there?
five .
and i believe there are more .
how are they?
insubstantial as ghosts " .
only i guess ... many of them were children back then .
yes , children who fell asleep .
most died during the acute stage of the illness .
those who survived . .. who awoke
seemed fine , as if nothing had happened .
we just did not realise how much the infection had damaged the brain .
years went by .
five , ten , fifteen
before these strange , neurological symptoms would appear .
but they did .
i began to see them in the early 1 930's .
old people brought in by their children .
young people brought in by their parents .
they could no longer dress themselves or feed themselves .
they could no longer speak in most cases .
certain families went mad .
people who were normal
were now  elsewhere .
what is it like to be them?
what are they thinking?
they are not .
the virus did not spare their higher faculties .
we know that for a fact?
yes .
because?
because the alternative is unthinkable .
i am all for fixing this place up , but , what are we doing?
i have a hunch .
what stops lucy from reaching the fountain?
nothing .
exactly , the visual field just stops .
there is no pattern .
nothing to compel her to keep going .
so , we are making something .
exactly .
she is looking out the ...
i want to know more about your son .
certainly .
something was wrong with his hands .
he could not write anymore .
he could not do the work .
i should take him out of school , they said .
he was eleven .
slowly , he got worse .
he would call me and i would come in and he was sitting at his desk
in a trance .
one hour , two hours ...
then he would be okay again .
one day i came home from work and found him in his bed .
he kept saying , " mum , mum? " ...
his arm was like this , reaching .
what do you want , leonard?
he never spoke again .
it was as if he disappeared .
later , that year , i took him to bainbridge .
it was ...
november 1 4 , 1 939 .
he was twenty years old .
what did he do for those nine years in this room?
he read .
he loved to read .
he read all the time .
really?
that was all he could do .
that is enough .
all right , leonard .
we are finished .
nothing , nothing , nothing and ...
nothing .
it is one of your statues .
exactly .
pass the salt .
what about this .
what do you mean?
it is a strobe .
you are wrong .
all of this before is the strobe .
this is me saying his name to him .
excuse me .
straight down the middle .
home it in there !
i can catch the ball .
throw me the ball !
is this all of them?
bring them in here with the others .
i should have given david his divorce .
i thought he wanted to be a father ...
the patients have been given their morning medication .
dr sayer hoped you had some free time .
come with me , please .
this is a beautiful aria .
watch them closely for any reaction .
call me ishmael .
some years ago , never mind how long precisely ,
having little money , and nothing in particular to interest me on shore .
i know you can hear me .
try to respond when i speak your name .
it is not just any music .
it has to be right for them .
it is as if they are only moved by music that moves them .
i have not found anything that moves bert , yet .
they sit there all day , if i let them .
i have to play the first card .
leonard . ..
l ...
this is frank .
help me get him to his feet .
there is something else that reaches him ...
human contact .
stand over there for a minute .
he cannot walk without me .
if i let go of him , he will fall .
i will not let you fall .
but ... he will walk with me anywhere .
it is like the ball , it is my will he is borrowing .
the will of another human being .
i will begin by moving the pointer to l for leonard .
when i sense you move the pointer , i will stop and you will take over .
do you understand? ...
all right .
i will begin .
no , maybe i did not make myself clear .
my fault , i ...
l ...
good , good .
now the e.
e , good .
s ...
p ...
you are spelling something else .
his gaze , from staring through the bars ,
has grown so weary that it can take in nothing more .
for him , it is as though there were a thousand bars
and behind the thousand bars , no world .
as he paces in cramped circles , over and over ,
his powerful strides are like a ritual dance around a centre
where a great will stands paralysed .
at times the curtains of the eye lift without a sound and a shape enters ,
slips through the tightened silence of the shoulders ,
reaches the heart , and dies .
have you heard of a drug called l dopa?
it is a synthetic dopamine .
yes , for parkinson's patients ...
why?
excuse me , sorry !
100 years would pass before modern neuropathology
would allow us to locate the damage in the parkinsonian brain .
with our development of the drug l dopa , we can for the first time promise
the parkinsonian patient a more normal life by administering l ...
i am very curious about this drug .
have you come across anyone who ...
excuse me , dr ...
sayer .
have you come across any patients with encephalitis?
after i am through , dr sayer .
if you would not mind .
as i was saying ... by administering l dopa .
do you think an extreme parkinsonian tremor
would appear as no tremor at all?
are you talking to me?
oh , yes .
imagine you accelerated a hand tremor to the point of immobility .
imagine a patient with all the parkinson symptoms accelerated .
the hand tremor , the head bobbing , quickening of speech .
might they not cave in on themselves and turn a person into stone?
i do not know .
maybe .
do you think l dopa would help?
dr sayer , right?
i am a chemist , you are the physician .
i will leave it to you to do the damage .
freud believed in miracles , prescribing cocaine as candy .
we all believed in cortisone until our patients went psychotic on it .
and now it is l dopa?
i think it is too soon to say that .
with all due respect , i think it is way too soon to say that .
let the chemists do the damage , doctor .
but i ...
dr kaufman , did you read this case?
new drug lets palsy patients eat jello .
yes , i read them all .
dutifully , soberly .
all 30 cases had mild parkinson's .
your " parkies " , if that is what they are , have not moved in decades .
perhaps you should look at it again , sir .
you know better than to make such a leap .
you want a connection ; that does not mean there is one .
what i believe , what i know , is that they are alive inside .
how do you know that?
because they catch tennis balls?
i know it .
how many did you think could have it?
all of them .
some ...
one .
one .
with the family's consent , signed .
leonard has parkinson's disease?
no ...
his symptoms are like parkinson's disease
but then again , they are not .
what will the medicine do for him?
i do not know what it will do for him , if anything at all .
what do you think it will do?
i am not sure , it was designed for a totally different disorder .
what do you hope it will do?
i hope ... it will bring him back from wherever he is .
to what?
to the world .
what is there here for him after all these years?
you ...
you are here .
all of it , please .
at 200 mg , he showed no response .
maybe the juice's acid neutralised it .
maybe he needs more .
maybe he needs less .
i will try it in milk .
500 mg .
i will call if there is any change .
yes .
thank you .
it is quiet .
it is late .
everyone is asleep .
i am not asleep .
no , you are awake .
may i?
me .
leonard , there is someone here to see you .
mum ...
mum !
my name is eleanor .
eleanor .
it is a pleasure to meet you .
it is a pleasure to meet you .
ladies?
now , what did i do?
oh , my goodness .
how do you do , sir?
my name is margaret .
beth .
anthony .
how are you?
great man .
how are you?
great , too .
did you meet him?
did he not look good?
i could not deal with losing 30 years of my life , could you?
he does realise it , does he not?
turn this way , please .
it is a camera called a polaroid .
thank you .
takes a picture in less than a minute .
amazing .
now , we could try this .
splendid ...
i would like you to walk to the end of the room .
ready?
go .
very good .
and back now .
that was very quick ...
let me get some more film .
you have to at least lay down .
you need the rest .
i am afraid to close my eyes .
if i close my eyes i will ...
you will sleep .
when you wake up in the morning , it will be the next morning .
i promise .
baby's boat , a silver moon , sailing in the sky .
baby is fishing for a dream , fishing near and far .
sail , baby , sail  out upon that sea .
only do not forget to sail back again to me .
what a wonderful place the bronx has become .
that is my school .
really?
is that classical?
you can pick any type of music .
what is that?
it is rock 'n 'roll .
come on in .
no , something happened while you were away .
it is called pollution .
leonard , that is not wading , that is swimming !
