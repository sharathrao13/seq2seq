you're 1 8 . 4 million dollars shy .
and i don't care how you cut it , that's a whole lot shy .
no ...
mr mcelroy , what we have there is a goodwill gesture .
a deposit .
a down payment .
one and a half million's not a bad start , is it?
i need to do some research .
i need to feed a few thousand to the kids , get some feedback .
you don't think i can allow you to walk out of here with $20 million for a formula that only exists in your head?
and all i get is what?
an ointment for toe jam .
uh huh?
market research .
right .
profile customers , send out questionnaires .
get out the bloody way , felix .
i can dig that .
but unless you've got what we agreed on , what the fuck am i doing here?

one little mistake ... 30 years ago .
all of these items are over the counter .
nothing illegal here .
you're no fucking help , are you?
i beg to differ .
you see , it's not the ingredients themselves which determine the effect but the manner in which they're combined .
these kids are getting very smart .
he's right .
the ravers are the key .
aren't you the clever little chunky monkey?
you keep banging on about my weight .
you're crossing a line .

you can't call it that .
punters'll feel like right tits asking for tabs of 438 l o u , whatever the number is .
no one's going to know what they're on about .
these scumbags spend their entire life smacked out of their heads .

every chemical used in the production of this drug is 1 00 % legal .
not one ingredient is found on any known government's banned substance watch list .
hell , you can ship supertankers of this shit .
you can even lay a goddamn pipeline and no one would bat an eye .
p o s 51 .
it's all that .
and it can be yours .
lf the price ... is right .
chemistry ... mr mcelroy .
what is chemistry ... .. but the ability to attract adoration in others?
you see , you're like me , mr mcelroy .
you're a sky highatrist , i'm a sky highatrist .
see aways krhew 'd be a drug deaer everh wherh was a kd saw my dad ht my mother my mother ht my brother my brother hit my sister , and my sister fuck my father .
so it's inevitable , really .
you'd have to be on drugs just to live in that madhouse , wouldn't you?
drugs are good , mr mcelroy .
drugs are our mates .
fuck .
i'm getting on my own nerves .
what i'm trying to say to you , mr mcelroy , is ... .. l'm very much attracted to what you have to offer .
how are you doing , felix?

accessory to murder .
possession of a firearm .
you fuck me ,
i'll have you on your hands and your knees , with your arse in the air , exposing your rusty sheriff's badge for the next 20 years .
so ask yourself , are you going to help restore some national pride , and stick one on the yanks?
or , like the rest of your life , are you going to piss it all away?

the questorh s whether it's going to pay me ... to be sentimental .
look , we have a choice .
we can use our " get out of jail free " cards , or we can choose " stop , do not pass go " .
do not collect 20 million dollars .
