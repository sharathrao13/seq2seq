turn to your right .
that's it , sir .
you're done .
please follow the orange line .
we processed the roll of film we found in your bag , mr. parrish .
they're not very pretty pictures .
also , you left the camera in the hotel .
we processed that roll as well .
can i see them?
that's not a courtesy , mr. parrish .
this is evidence .
do you guys have your own lab ... or do you have to send it out?
we have a lab .
your legal aide should be here within 30 minutes or so .
now you understand you don't have to talk to me until she gets here if you don't want to .
you know that , sy?
mm hmm .
good .
sy , can i ask you one question?
sure .
what was it about william yorkin that upset you so?
i mean , what did he do to provoke all of this?
family photos depict smiling faces ...
births , weddings , holidays ...
happy birthday !
children's birthday parties .
people take pictures of the happy moments in their lives .
someone looking through our photo album would conclude that we had led a joyous , leisurely existence ... free of tragedy .
no one ever takes a photograph of something they want to forget .
hey , we're gonna go .
sure you don't need my help?
yeah .
sorry , kiddo .
i gotta work .
doesn't matter .
i'm gonna get some takeout for dinner , okay?
okay .
see ya .
see ya .
jake , are you coming or what?
i'm coming !
there's one .
okay .
mom , can i check out the toys?
just for a minute .
i'm just dropping off some film .
make sure you can see me , okay?
okay .
hey , mrs. yorkin .
hey , yoshi .
how are you?
how have you been?
long time no see .
we're doin 'good , thanks .
got 3 rolls today .
okay .
can i get that address again?
yes , it's 3 326 serrano terrace , yoshi .
i'll take care of mrs. yorkin .
what have we got today?
two rolls , and i think
i've got one in here as well .
and can i have 2 prints of each , please?
leica mini lux .
that's a very nice camera .
really?
mm hmm .
because will's been trying to get me to go digital
oh , don't do that .
i'd be out of a job .
hey .
oh .
you have one shot left .
oh , that's okay .
oh , it's a shame to waste it .
oh , no , really , it's fine .
oh , no , please .
i look horrible .
how's jake doing?
oh , he's great .
just had a birthday , and
oh .
how old is he , 9?
that's right .
he just turned 9 .
9 .
hmm .
got a winner .
thanks .
when do you need these by?
can i have them today?
oh .
you know , we close at 7 : 00 on sundays .
oh , well , it's not important .
i can i can swing by tomorrow .
mrs. yorkin , you're one of our best customers .
i'll have 'em for you by the time we close .
thank you so much .
no problem .
i'll go get some shopping done .
we'll see you in 40 minutes .
thanks , sy .
bye .
bye .
hey, jake .
you sliced through an exposure on that last roll , sy .
yes , yoshi , i know .
i made a mistake .
mrs. levitt has a problem ... offer her a free roll of film .
all right .
i've been doing p. o. s. mini lab work for over 20 years now .
i consider it an important job .
when people's houses are on fire ... what's the first thing they save after their pets and their loved ones are safe?
the family photos .
some people think that this is a job for a clerk .
they actually believe that any idiot that attends a 2 day seminar can master the art of making beautiful prints in less than an hour .
but of course , like most things ... there's far more to it than meets the eye .
i've seen the prints they fob off on people at the rexall or fotek .
milky , washed out prints .
too dark prints .
there's no sense of reverence for the service they're providing for people .
i process these photos as if they were my own .
i see someone had quite a birthday party .
i did them 5x7 for you .
oh , i wanted them 4x6 .
um , the larger ones are better .
i didn't charge you extra for them .
okay , um ... it's okay , i guess .
how much do i owe you , sy?
uh , 30 . 06 , but let's just call it an even 30 .
all right , thanks .
you know , we have a special gift for birthday boys .
really?
mm hmm .
that's right .
birthday boys get a free camera .
wow . jake , what do you say?
thanks .
you're welcome , buddy .
we're taking jake to six flags this weekend , so ...
i'll see you very soon .
see you .
come on, jake .
bye .
see ya, jake .
well , what a cool camera , huh?
yeah .
good night , a. j.
that's just great .
oh , look at this .
this is a great shot .
i remember that .
nice truck .
oh , you guys are so cute .
ah .
you are so sweet .
okay , this one's going into the trash .
let me see .
oh , yeah .
look at your face .
that's a classic .
will , i need that back .
no , you're not getting it back .
will , i'm serious .
don't give it to her .
better give it to her .
she's serious .
she's serious .
hey !
told you .
hey , how'd this one get in here?
oh , that's sy .
sy?
sy , the photo guy .
oh , yeah .
sy took it to finish off the roll .
i get you anything else , sy?
oh , no , thanks .
just the check's fine .
what you got there , family photos?
yeah .
yeah?
you mind if i take a look?
mmm , these are beautiful .
that's a good shot .
these your , uh , relations?
yes .
that's my little nephew, jake .
he's a handsome boy .
isn't he?
yeah .
i , uh , i got him a camera for his birthday .
oh .
well , you must be his favorite uncle then .
i don't know .
sure i can't get you no more coffee then?
oh , no .
i'm fine , thanks .
have a nice night now .
you , too .
mom?
what , pookie?
i feel bad for someone .
somebody at school?
no .
what do you mean , you feel bad?
when someone seems sad ... they don't have any friends ... and people make fun of'em ... that makes me feel bad for them .
who is sad and doesn't have any friends?
sy .
sy?
the photo guy at the one hour place?
yeah .
oh, jake .
i really feel bad for him .
but jake ... we don't know that sy is sad .
we really don't know that much about him , you know?
i mean , he might even have a lot of friends .
he probably has a girlfriend and and a mommy and a daddy who love him .
i don't think he does .
oh .
tch .
that is so sweet of you to think of somebody else like that , you know?
listen, jake ... not everybody is as lucky as we are .
you know?
but maybe if we send them good thoughts ... we'll make them feel better .
so why don't we close our eyes and send sy some good thoughts?
okay .
okay?
all right?
ready?
yeah .
there .
i bet the next time we see sy ... he won't seem so sad .
okay .
you have to go to sleep , pookie .
okay .
i love you .
good night .
good night .
tch , tch , tch .
there you go .
come on .
how how do you think we pay for all this?
how how do you think we pay for all this?
i'm just asking you .
what do you think ... there's a money fairy that comes and slips an envelope under my pillow every month?
what are you even talkin 'about?
well well , how all of this stuff ... the new mercedes , the matching washer and dryer ... the fucking jil sander blouse you have on now how?
i love you , nina .
i do ... but if you continually want our life to look like something out of a magazine , i'm sorry .
i've gotta work to make that happen .
do you even believe what you're saying , huh?
this is not about things , will ... and it's not about money .
you're neglectful .
do you understand that?
what?
you are an emotionally neglectful husband ... and you're an emotionally neglectful father .
got it now?
that's just fuckin 'great .
neglectful?
you're not here , will .
you're not here .
you're never here .
i'm going to bed .
nude photos of her
lf , in your mind
bart , what's wrong with you?
oh , my god !
someone's trying to kill me !
oh , wait .
it's for bart.
but who'd wanna hurt me?
i'm this century's dennis the menace .
it's probably the person you least suspect .
that's good , dad .
monday is our busiest day .
people tend to shoot most of their pictures on weekends .
the store has several regular customers .
there's mrs. von unwerth who only takes pictures of her cats .
i've never seen a picture of a human being .
just cats .
2 copies , please , mr. parrish .
there's mr. siskind .
mr. siskind is an insurance claims adjuster .
he only brings in pictures of wrecked cars .
the usual , sy .
i need these by 3 : 00 .
we get all the new parents which , in this neighborhood ... makes up a big part of our business .
new parents go photo crazy .
i don't know how many rolls i have here .
cindy , a nurse from a nearby cosmetic surgery clinic is a regular customer .
we do all of dr. fried's before and after shots .
oh , thanks , sy .
then there's the amateur porn artists .
we have to report kiddie porn and animal cruelty ... but anything else , no questions asked .
is look at these prints .
plus point 3?
sy , are you fuckin 'kiddin 'me?
point 3?
nobody gives a shit until those shifts are in the double digits .
it's blue , larry .
well , i bet brandt cares about a plus point 3 .
are you fuckin 'threatening me?
you're breakin 'my balls over a plus 3 blue shift .
fuckin 'asshole .
next time you call me out here ... that thing better be belching fire .
that's a great attitude , larry .
thanks for your precision work .
sy .
what the hell you doin '?
excuse me?
what was the deal with you and the agfa guy?
well , bill , i'm trying to preserve a minimum level of quality for my customers .
your customers .
and he seems to think that a plus point 3 shift to cyan is insignificant .
it's massive .
sy , let me try and explain something to you one more time .
you need to take another look at your place on the food chain .
these aren't your customers .
they're savmart's customers .
if you haven't noticed , this isn't neiman marcus .
people just wanna come in here with their kids ... have a good time , and save a few pennies on paper towels and socks .
if they wanted to see yelling and screaming ... they'd stay at home .
it was wrong of me to create a scene in front of all those customers , bill .
it won't happen again .
sy , don't you have some vacation time saved up?
i guess i probably do .
you should take some time off .
go down to a club med .
you know , relax .
lay in the sun .
enjoy life .
well , i'll think about that , bill .
and sy , your lunch break was up 1/ 2 an hour ago , man .
what the hell you been doin 'in here?
oh , uh , excuse me .
i need some help here .
i'm trying to figure out if this will work with my mac .
i'm sorry .
this isn't my section .
you're will yorkin .
yeah .
sy parrish .
i'm the photo tech here .
i do all your family's pictures .
oh , right .
sy .
sy , the photo guy .
right .
here you are in the fesh .
yeah .
oh , it's just that
i don't see you in here too often .
uh , well , no .
nina usually does most of the shopping .
um , can you help me with this?
well , i wish i could , but this is computers ... and i do photo finishing .
it's not my section .
i'm actually in just a little bit of a rush .
i had one question i needed answered .
oh , no problem .
i'll get , uh , i'll get someone .
customer needs immediate assistance aisle 4 .
customer assistance , aisle 4 .
someone will be here in just a minute .
great , thanks .
you got it .
so is the rest of the family here?
uh, jake's around here somewhere .
you're a very lucky man , mr. yorkin .
i'm sorry?
you have a wonderful family ... and if you don't mind my saying so ... a very beautiful house , too .
well , thank you , sy , i , uh ... appreciate that ... but l you know , i really need to get all this stuff and get the hell outta here .
hey , i understand .
thanks for all your help , though .
oh , it's okay .
you say hello for me .
i will do .
well , i gotta be gettin 'back .
there'll be someone here in just
there you go .
oh , uh , great .
you know , it doesn't say here if this will work for the mac or not .
uh , no , this is p. c. only .
we have some mac based stuff down here .
ooh !
jake .
hi .
i was just talking to your dad .
what do you have there?
evangelion .
oh .
neon genesis evangelion .
wow .
what does he do?
well , he's a good guy .
he can fy , and he has a silver sword that can kill bad guys .
really?
yeah , and he's 60 feet tall .
and you really want this , don't you?
yeah .
yeah , well
jake .
come on .
no more toys .
we're leaving .
i gotta go .
well , i'll put this back for you , okay?
thanks .
see ya .
see ya later .
i told you not to talk to strangers .
i'm sure my customers never think about it ... but these snapshots are their little stands against the fow of time .
the shutter is clicked ... the fash goes off ... and they've stopped time ... if just for the blink of an eye .
and if these pictures have anything important to say to future generations , it's this ...
i was here .
i existed .
i was young .
i was happy ...
and someone cared enough about me in this world to take my picture .
how much for this one?
most people don't take snapshots of the little things ... the used band aid ... the guy at the gas station ... the wasp on the jell o ... but these are the things that make up the true picture of our lives .
people don't take pictures of these things .
aw, jake ... you really have to tidy up your room , pal .
i bet your mother's told you a thousand times .
hey , chaz .
first down .
it's a good game .
hi , sy .
i thought you said you were going out today .
uncle sy .
can you help me put this together?
how many prints would you like of these?
just one set .
maya , that's a very beautiful name .
thank you .
have you ever picked up prints here before?
i think maybe once .
it was a long time ago .
your face looks very familiar .
you work around here?
sorta near here .
i've probably seen you around the mall .
i'm in here pretty often .
well , we're a little backed up today .
is 6 : 00 okay?
i probably won't be able to pick them up till tomorrow or the next day .
see you then .
thanks .
come on , a little hustle !
a little hustle !
all right .
here we go .
right there .
come on .
good shot .
that's the way to strike the ball .
you gotta get in front of those , son .
jake , i want you to drill it , all right?
visualize where you want the ball to go and drill it .
good one, jake .
jake , that's not good enough .
we're gonna have to work on that .
all right?
all right .
pay attention , fellas .
a little focus .
drill it in there , matt .
come on !
good shot .
good shot .
next practice , thursday .
if you can't make it , be sure and tell derrick .
hey, jake .
hi .
toby , you forgot your sweatshirt .
i was just on my way home from work .
i saw you out there .
i thought i'd check it out .
jake .
you all right?
yeah .
your mom picking you up?
nah , i got my bike .
that was a great shot you made .
but your coach was a little rough .
i thought he should be more supportive .
do you want me to have a word with him for you?
nah , it's okay .
i will .
no , thanks .
okay .
when i was your age ...
i wasn't very good at sports .
mmm .
i was kinda chubby kid .
oh .
let's face it .
i was fat .
i was sick all the time .
kept comin 'down with mono and hepatitis ... and then i broke my collarbone ... and i had to wear this weird cast where i kept my arm up like this all winter .
i wasn't exactly the most popular kid .
how'd you break your collarbone?
oh , i fell out of a tree .
how's your dad doing?
good .
does he come to see the games?
yeah , sometimes .
does he come to see any of the games?
he's really busy at work .
i don't know .
he's he's busy all the time .
he sounds like an important guy .
i guess .
he owns a company and everything .
probably just wants to make sure that you and your mom have all the nice things you want ...
like that cool bike and those soccer shoes .
hold on .
yeah .
you know , those things cost money .
he'd be here if he could .
i guess .
i got something for you .
wanna guess what it is?
whoa .
what's wrong?
it's it's the one you wanted .
mr. parrish , i can't take this .
sure you can, jake .
my parents won't let me .
i'd better be gettin 'back home now .
you sure?
yeah .
thanks anyway , mr. parrish .
okay , see you around the store .
okay .
hey, jake .
the name's sy .
okay , sy .
well , there's
there's been , like , some kind of shift .
i don't know .
a couple of weeks .
maybe five weeks .
six .
no , i know that , but ...
um , yeah , but this
this feels different , you know?
listen, jan ...
i can't talk right now .
i'll call you back this afternoon .
okay .
i know .
i love you , too .
bye .
hi , sy .
hi there .
i was just at the dairy queen .
i saw you down here and thought i'd say hello .
i'm just grabbing some shopping fuel .
i never see you away from the store .
after all these years , you'd think we'd run into each other at some point .
why , do you live around here?
i live downtown .
mmm .
well , that's quite a drive .
no , i'm used to it .
you have a nice boy there .
oh, jake .
yeah .
a little sensitive , maybe , but , um ...
he likes you , sy .
aw .
he calls you " sy the photo guy .
you know , i've watched him grow since he was this big .
that's right .
you've been doing our pictures for a long time .
you know , i almost feel like " uncle sy .
well , i've got some serious shopping to do , sy .
oh , sure .
take care .
oh , my god .
what?
that's so weird .
l l i'm
i'm reading that exact book right now .
you're kidding .
no .
i can't believe that you'd be reading that book .
you know , he writes a lot about noticing coincidence , doesn't he?
yeah , he does .
that thing he says about fear
oh .
the things we fear the most have already happened to us .
wow .
i had no idea you were such a deep thinker , sy .
i wouldn't say that .
do you have any children , sy?
me?
no .
no .
i'm not married .
no girlfriend?
no .
i have a snapshot of my mother , though .
hmm .
she looks very nice .
she's passed away .
oh .
well , um ...
i'm sorry , sy .
gosh , you know , i have to go .
um , it was really nice chatting with you .
it was nice chatting with you .
um ...
i'll probably see you very soon .
we can't seem to go a day without taking a picture of something , so
sy parrish , please see the manager .
sy to the manager's office immediately , please .
what's with the getup , sy?
it's wednesday , bill .
i was doin 'the srs .
sy , there's been some discrepancies in the click count .
oh , well , that's probably yoshi .
you know , his math skills are pretty weak ... but i told you about that when you moved him over from audio .
no , all the discrepancies are on the logs that you initialed .
they are?
yeah .
oh .
i , you know ...
i guess sometimes the end of the week you get a little tired
we're not talking about a few innocent math errors , sy .
the net clicks all zero out .
they always zero out .
the problem is , sy , that the shutdown clicks don't correspond at all .
i mean , they don't even come close to matching the amount of prints that we sold .
well , then , it's probably a problem with the reorder counter .
well , i asked larry about that .
what did he say?
well , he looked at the counter and said that it checked out .
he also said that in 14 years of servicing ... he's never seen a faulty counter on an agfa unit .
really?
so the question is , sy ... where did all those unaccounted for prints go?
well , what kind of discrepancy are we talking about , bill?
we're talking about hundreds of prints , sy .
oh !
that's not possible , bill .
oh , no .
i've done the math ... and the p. o. s confirm it , too .
well , i don't know anything about it .
oh , i think you do , sy .
well , i don't , bill .
look , sy , i've got a family .
i'm not losing my job over this .
i'm lettin 'you go .
no .
oh .
these log discrepancies would be enough ... but you've been spacing out on the job ... taking 90 minute lunch breaks ... creating scenes in front of the customers ... giving away free merchandise .
what?
free disposable cameras to customers on their birthday?
that must have been your bright idea .
sure as shit isn't company policy .
you can't do this .
it's done , sy .
i talked to sims at district .
now you finish out the week and clear out your locker .
and if you do somethin 'like fuck up today's prints
i haven't fucked up a customer's prints in 11 years .
just get back out there .
hey , sy .
sy .
jake wanted to get his birthday gift processed .
i'm sorry?
the camera .
right .
the birthday gift .
number of sets?
oh , just one is fine .
4x6?
5x7?
um , the ones we usually get .
standard .
jake had a really great time with the camera .
didn't you, jake?
yeah .
yeah .
what was that address again?
it's 326 serrano terrace .
sy , are you all right?
i'm fine .
i'll have these for you tomorrow .
all right .
thanks , sy .
bye .
bye .
oh .
i'm leaving early today , yoshi .
okay , sy .
i won't be coming back , yoshi .
bill let me go .
you were fired?
yep .
really?
really .
wow .
i've really enjoyed working with you , yoshi .
yeah , me , too , sy .
sy?
sy , i just wanted to , um ... well , i guess i just wanted to say thank you , you know?
for what?
for teachin 'me all this stuff .
you're welcome , yoshi .
don't let the place go downhill , okay?
i won't , sy .
here they are .
oh , my pictures .
let me see .
let me see .
come on .
what the hell's wrong with these people?
the universe grows smaller every day .
there must be security for all ... or no one is secure .
it is no concern of ours how you run your own planet .
but if you threaten to extend your violence ... this earth of yours will be reduced to a burned out cinder .
now , we do not pretend to have achieved perfection .
but we do have a system , and it works .
your choice is simple : join us and live in peace or pursue your present course and face obliteration .
we shall be waiting for your answer .
the decision rests with you .
aah !
ah !
according to the oxford english dictionary ... the word " snapshot " was first used in 1808 by an english sportsman by the name of sir andrew hawker .
he noted in his diary that almost every bird he shot that day was taken by snapshot ... meaning a hurried shot taken without deliberate aim .
can i help you , sy?
just dropping off some film .
just a customer .
i can still shop here , can't i , bill?
no , sy , you can't still shop here .
i believe i can , bill .
shh .
there's no law that says
i can't shop here just because i was fired .
i checked it out .
there's a thousand other places you could do your photos .
there's no reason to come all the way down here other than to fuck with me .
there's a very good reason .
i calibrated that machine personally .
it's the best mini lab in the state .
all right , sy .
just this one time .
but i'm telling you ... find another place to do your film .
i do not want you back in here .
thanks , bill .
what is it , yoshi?
you can't just
leave your station unmanned down there .
i think you need to see these , sir .
what have you got there?
is it the anal sex fiend again?
motherfucker .
what would you say
mr. parrish's demeanor was when he came in?
demeanor?
yeah .
how did he seem?
did he seem upset or agitated in any way?
um ... i don't know .
he seemed fine .
sy and i had some words when he came into the store .
under the circumstances , i was surprised to see him ... and i asked him what he was doing here ... and i ... i suggested in strong language that in the future he bring his pictures somewhere else .
yoshi , i'm gonna need to make some xerox copies of this .
can you show me where i can get that done?
yeah .
mr. owens , why don't you come and grab a seat and try to calm down?
your wife and child , they're , uh ... they're somewhere safe now?
uh ... they're at my mother's .
i'm i'm sorry .
i'm just a little upset .
no , no , no , no .
i understand .
it's ...
it's understandable .
so how did he take his being fired?
i've had to fire a lot of people , detective .
people get upset when they get fired .
he got pretty upset .
he knew that mr. araki would see the photos ... and he knew he'd show them to you and that you'd call us .
i think it's just a warning .
but you have to take it seriously .
oh , we take it very seriously .
your child's life has been indirectly threatened .
we take no chances in this county .
there's an apb out on his white toyota .
officers are en route to his apartment now with a search warrant .
i've got plainclothes officers on standby inside the store and out .
now , look ... he may come back and pick up his photos .
he may not .
it's hard to say .
i doubt he will .
you really think that's a good idea?
i mean , this place is wall to wall families .
if he's stupid enough to come back here ... he'll never make it inside the store .
are you insane?
mr. parrish , this is the police !
i'm just trying to make
if you're in the apartment ... we need to know right now !
that's crazy .
can you explain this?
kill that tv .
he must be programmed for courage .
mr. parrish !
it's clear .
officer lyon .
double 6 , 3 2 1 .
go ahead , 3 2 1 .
i need to be patched through to van der zee in tmu .
right away , please .
3 2 1 , that's a 10 4 .
hey , dan ... take a look at this .
what do you got?

dad !
are you married , detective?
you have any children?
i'll be the one asking the questions here , sy .
i know .
just one question .
detective , are you a family man?
that's none of your business , sy .
sir , you're right , it isn't .
it is none of my business .
but i'm guessing by your answer and that ring on your finger that you are ... and that makes you a very fortunate man .
i can also tell by the way that you've treated me so far and the way you carry out your job , you're a good man ... good husband and father ... a man who appreciates his good fortune .
you're not the type of father who'd cheat on his wife ... hurt his family , betray their trust .
you would never neglect and abuse your children .
make horrible demands of your children .
you would never ask ...
you would never ask your children to do things ... things that children shouldn't do .
you would never take disgusting , sick ... degraded pictures of your children d doing these things .
you would never treat your children like animals .
will yorkin had it all , and he threw it all away .
he's not a good father .
well , i , uh ... ahem .
i think i understand now , sy .
thank you for answering my question so candidly .
you're welcome .
can i see my pictures now?
sure , sy .
thank you .
