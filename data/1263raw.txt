she can have baltimore .
i'm fine with my lovely little summer place ...

soova motors is offering you five million dollars to do a car commercial ... to air only in norway .

the monroe " eagle " cole presidential library .
i like it !
european rationalism interwoven with american modernism ... a metaphor of organic growth ... a man made mountain over which soars the eagle .
it's fantastic .
is it big enough?
it's , uh , 40, 000 square feet , sir .
and?
clinton's is 20, 000 , sir .
excellent .
it's the former first lady , sir .
shall i tell her you're out?
no , no , no .
will you excuse me?
here he is , mrs. cole .
and the problem is?
as the man who has just gotten the most lucrative speaking fees , the biggest book deal ... the most board offers in history , i would think you'd know .
come on , honey lamb .
you don't believe all that nonsense , do you?
no , eagle .
i believe it's just the tip of the iceberg .
charlotte , lamb , we settled .
pioneers settle .
we rested .
seven million .

fifteen minutes .
an hour .
thirty .
forty five , and it's a deal .
okay .
whoo !
yea . !
sorry .
good evening .
i'd like to thank everybody for coming .
tonight is a very special night for mooseport .
in the words of hunt langley , who put it so eloquently in the moose call ...
the eagle has landed !
how original .
on behalf of the town council , let's give a big mooseport welcome ... to our newest citizen ...
monroe " eagle " cole !
whoo . !
yea !
thank you .
thank you very much .
thank you .
as you all know , it's been over a year since i vacationed up here .
so , first off ... to the rumor that i'm only here because ...
i lost my baltimore house in my divorce ... absolutely true .
i am a mooseport resident ... and even though i didn't get a chance to meet many of you when i was up here as president ...
i certainly hope to ...
i certainly would , uh ...
hope to get to know you all a lot better .
maybe we could , uh , hit a few birdies or , uh , eagles ...
at your local golf links .
anyway , since i'm not here to ask for money ...
i don't know what else to say ... except to thank you so much ... for your hospitality ... and see you around the burg .
hear !
hear !
let's go .
thank you , mr. president .
that was great .
let's go .
thank you , mr. president .
that was great .
uh , could a few of us have a word with you in private?
the president has a limited amount of time .
sorry .
this'll take just a second .
it's kind of urgent .
certainly .
right this way .
excuse me .
mr. president , i'm sorry the timing isn't better ... but it seems that your arrival has coincided with something of a crisis .
folks , i'm the crisismeister .
shall i call the marines?
would you care to sit down , please?
thank you .
mr. president , amos harmon ... our beloved mayor of 24 years , just passed away .
oh , i'm sorry to hear that .
anyway , sir ... the town council met an hour ago in an emergency session ... and voted unanimously to beseech you , sir ... to be our mayor .
your mayor?
mayor !
that's good .
yes , sir .
you see , before he died , mayor harmon was running , as always , unopposed .
and with the filing deadline tomorrow ... we were having a dilly of a time trying to find a replacement .
and then reuben here pipes up and says , " why not get the president? '
i said , " get the president !
in our 240 year history , there would be no greater honor bestowed on our town .
to have as our mayor the most popular president in history .
popular , with approval ratings in the 70s .
eighties , actually .
uh , 85 .
eighty five .
eighty five?
unbelievable .
mr. president , you simply must say yes .
well , folks , uh , even though i'm not in the oval office any longer ...
i do have plans .
sally , please .
we're in the middle of something here .
sorry .
l ...
i was just ... getting my coat .
i'll come back .
uh , hold on a second .
sally , is it?
yes .
sally , you seem like an engaged citizen .
uh , what would you think about my being mayor?
mayor?
really?
it was my idea !
um , i think you should do it .
and then maybe you could do something about that landing situation .
the landing situation?
uh , yeah .
i'm a veterinarian ... and i had a critically ill donkey in my helicopter this morning ... and i almost lost her because ... the president just had to land first .
oh , i'm terribly sorry .
that must have been a procedural thing .
standard security protocol .
standard security .
maybe if you were mayor , you could do something about that .
hmm .
absolutely .
things like that shouldn't happen .
i appreciate your opinion .
it's really , really nice to meet you , mr. president .
nice to meet you too , sally .
thank you .
thank you .
well , mr. president?
i'm sorry , gentlemen .
hold on a second there , bullard .
maybe ...
excuse me , mr. president .
i suggest that we give them an answer tomorrow .
gentlemen , he'll sleep on it .
yes , l i'll sleep on it .
so we'll hear from you in the morning , sir?
you have my word .
you have the eagle's word .
thank you , mr. president !
by god , that's just the way he sounds on tv !
hey !
sorry .
connelly's septic tank broke again .
oh .
stood up for a septic tank .
no .
no .
you look good .
yeah .
yeah?
eww !
what?
you stink !
too much cologne?
no , not enough ...
did you think about a shower?
l ...
yes , i did , but then i would have been more late .
i didn't think it was bad .
you know how you can't smell your own smell?
that's what we got going on here .
yeah .
so is this thing over?
it's over for me .
hey , what do you wanna do?
you wanna get something to eat?
i'm not that hungry .
i think i'm just gonna go home .
what?
is it that bad?
i'll take a shower .
we can take a shower .
i already took a shower .
come on , sally .
what's the problem?
i don't know .
i'm just ...
you know , for the past six years ...
today , when you said you were ...
i don't know , handy .
why don't you tell me what the problem is?
i don't have a problem .
well , that's the problem .
what do you ...
i'll see you tomorrow .
i should've showered .
your newspapers .
good morning , ma'am .
beautiful , ramona .
beautiful .
today's agenda , ma'am .
thank you , john .
perfect , smitty .
for god's sakes , save me from mooseport , rod .
well , how 'bout a job at the pentagon .
gotta go .
good morning , mr. president .
good morning , good morning , good morning .
oh , smitty !
thank you so much .
sir .
what's on tap today?
read the paper .
finally !
grace , you're wonderful .
then you can take that jog you've been wanting to take .
mmm .
fabulous .
oh , uh , about that mayor thing ...
oh , don't worry , mr. president .
we'll take care of it .
while the president is flattered , he declines .
his schedule precludes him ...
actually , i'm considering it .
sir?
actually , i'm considering it .
sir?
yeah , why not?
largely ceremonial .
any work involved you can do .
we run everything else we're involved in .
why not mooseport?
w well , sir , actually ...
as your first move out of office , you become mayor?
it's , uh , beneath you .
and from a p. r. standpoint , it's ...
fantastic .
for the love of public service , eagle cole ... the most beloved president since jack kennedy , agrees to help .
perfect .
and don't forget the wicked witch of the west wing .
she can't claim this is a vacation house if i'm the mayor , can she?
true .
wait until the filing deadline .
then call them with the good news .
yes , sir .
mayor .
we're going to run " turdport " .
thank you very much , gentlemen .
i won't let mooseport down .
you have the eagle's word , okay?
thank you , mr. president !
good bye now !
bye !
it was my idea !
congratulations , kent .
congratulations , stu .
oh , morris , you might want to read this .
holy crap !
thank you so much for meeting with us again , sir .
when we talked last night , nobody else had put in for mayor .
unbeknownst to us , irma brisker , our town registrar ... took it upon herself to persuade harold harrison ...
you might know him as handy harrison , sir .
runs the hardware store .
doing some construction work on your home , i believe .
to run for mayor as well .
well , okay then .
you've got your mayor .
if he wants it , he can have it .
sir , it's a touch more complicated than that .
what's complicated?
it's just that , you see , sir , it kind of got out in the press that you're both in .
what press?
well ...
when the deadline passed , we called hunt langley down at the moose call .
he said when this got around , it would be national news .
of course it will be national news .
press will say i'm trying to squash a bug .
you can rest assured , sir , that not one of them said anything like that .
did they , stu?
no , sir .
none of them said that .
a couple of them called it " david and goliath , " but none of them said that .
what do you mean " them "?
who's " them "?
nbc .
cbs .
fox .
it was really exciting !
uh huh .
what , are you telling me the entire country thinks i'm running for mayor ... against the man installing my toilets?
but , sir , you said " eagle's word .
ah , hell !
stop eating the fertilizer .
go on over there .
look . !
it's the president . !
do you see him?
which car is he in?
oh , yeah , it's him !
company's coming , and bruce is out again .
what is this?
that's bruce the moose , sir .
it's a rescued animal .
handy's pet .
shouldn't it be in a zoo?
afternoon , mr. president .
oh , hello , handy .
is everything okay with that water heater?
everything is fine .
i just wondered if you had a minute .
hey , i'm bob .
i'm working for you too .
bob , nice to see you .
i'm sorry , mr. president .
bob , martha and irma .
martha .
irma .
paint .
pipes .
wood products , like your last two cabinet appointments .
handy , aren't you gonna introduce me?
oh , sorry .
this is mandy .
hi .
mandy and handy .
how cute .
oh !
uh , could we speak privately for a moment?
yeah .
sure .
wh ...
that's my office right over there .
outstanding .
excuse me .
i have a private meeting with the president .
iguana on your left , sir .
whoo !
what a dump .
well , sir .
this is it .
oh , it's cozy .
nice office , yeah .
thank you .
how can i help you , mr. president?
well , handy , as i'm sure you know , we've both put in for mayor .
no , i didn't know that , sir .
you didn't know that?
i knew that i put in .
i thought i was just doin 'the town a favor , that's all .
i thought i was running all by myself .
as you can see , we have a bit of a situation .
yeah , it's ...
we got a bit of a pickle here .
bit of a pickle .
exactly .
so i was thinking that one of us should withdraw .
i would be happy if it were me .
lord knows i have nothing left to prove , much less being the mayor of anything .
but i have a p. r. problem .
oh .
ohh .
p. r. prob ...
is it serious?
well , it got out to the press that i had given my word .
oh .
right .
you know , " you have the eagle's word .
right .
like on tv .
tv .
exactly .
so , um ...
well , look , uh ...
you're a golfer , right?
are you any good?
i get around .
i get around .
like a 10 handicap , maybe , on a good day .
ten?
me too .
we should knock it around sometime .
that would be an honor .
well , uh , if you're trying to make a name for yourself in golf ... you wouldn't , uh , start off by ...
oh .
nice shot .
challenging tiger woods .
no , you'd start small ... local tournaments .
same in politics .
you don't start a political career ... by running against the former president of the united states .
fine .
fine .
it was a privilege to run .
it's a privilege to withdraw .
well , it's settled .
what's settled?
it turns out we both put in for mayor , so i just withdrew .
chicken !
i'm glad i could help with that p. r. problem .
bruce is out of his pen again .
did anybody happen to notice that?
he probably chewed through the rope .
bob , put him back .
i already did it .
oh .
excuse me .
i'm sorry .
sally , the president .
we just had a meeting .
we met last night when i was being stood up .
look , i'm sorry if i was rude to you .
i'm really embarrassed .
rude?
don't be silly .
no .
what you said helped convince me to be mayor .
really?
you're gonna do it !
you're gonna be our mayor !
great !
it is , isn't it?
i'm so glad i ran into you .
you know , i decided to get a dog .
i thought you already had a dog .
yes , i do .
a great animal .
a shih tzu .
westie .
westie needs a friend , and i thought if you were available ...
let's say tomorrow night , perhaps ... we could discuss it over , uh , dinner .
dinner?
yeah , i could really use your , uh , professional advice on this .
really?
my advice?
mm hmm .
uh , okay .
well , dinner would be fine .
great . !
looking forward to it .
my people will get in touch with your people .
i don't have people .
but i could give you my number .
well , my people will get your number and we'll set up a time .
i'm sure whatever time we do set , you'll be on time .
absolutely .
looking forward to it .
see you on the links , sir .
and thanks again for being so helpful .
yeah .
right .
you mean rolling over .
sally ...
you know , bruce is a baby .
babies like to chew things like rope .
ooh ooh .
okay , then .
sally , is it me ... or did you just get asked out by that president guy?
yes , i think i did .
probably couldn't chew through this , right?
and and is it me or did you just say yes ... to the president guy?
yes , i think i did .
look , sally , i'm sorry that i was late , okay ... but you can't date the president because of that .
do you really think that's the reason?
why , then?
why not?
here .
use this .
shut up !
sally , i wanna talk to you !
sally , i wanna talk with ...
thank you very much .
it was very nice of you .
say bye bye now .
it's irene .
mr. president !
yes , handy .
what is it?
mr. president !
thank you very much .
uh huh?
i can't do it , sir .
i can't drop out of the mayor race .
excuse me?
i , uh , i don't have the eagle thing like you , but i'm a man of my word too .
every man's word's important .
isn't that true?
does he want money?
wh what is it?
if you stay in this race , then i'm i'm sure you're gonna slaughter me , but ...
i'm runnin 'for the mayor of mooseport !
is he losin 'his mind?
l ... uh ...
what just happened?
you're runnin 'against the president .
and your girlfriend's datin 'him .
mm hmm .
i repeat ... mm hmm !
no , larry , the president has no comment .
no .
no comment .
thank you .
that's all the networks , 60 minutes and larry king .
the handyman's girlfriend?
his girlfriend?
why didn't you tell me?
i'm gonna look like an idiot .
i tried to tell you , mr. president .
remember?
why didn't you try harder?
what am i supposed to do now , apologize?
back down?
you want to call bert langdon?
for what?
i don't need a campaign manager for this .
hello?
one second .
mr. president .
bert langdon on line one .
bert , what a coincidence .
what's shakin '?
that's what i was gonna ask you , eagle .
it's deader than nixon down here .
i'd be happy to roll up my sleeves and come up there if you want .
bert , i'm running against my plumber .
is there something i don't know?
you watching fox news?
the results are quite interesting .
the poll , of course , is preliminary ... but it does show harrison with surprising strength .
there's an eight percent margin of error , and it's still early ... but it looks to be very close .
seems to me the president has got himself in a bit of a horse race .
eagle , you with me?
don't you mean moose race?
eagle . !
hey . !
oh ho . !
there she is !
hey , come on .
let's go .
that's her right there .
sally . !
miss mannis !
are you dr. sally mannis?
yeah .
just a couple of questions about handy harrison .
hey !
watch it .
is it true you've been seeing mr. harrison for six years?
now you're dating the president .
oh , no .
i'm not dating the president .
it's one date .
i'm not even sure you'd call it a date .
you wouldn't call it a date?
what would you call it exactly?
just a couple more questions !
when did he ask you out?
have you and the president had sex yet?
for god's sakes !
think about it , handy .
for our mayor , we could have the president of the united states .
what are you trying to do to us?
you know he's gonna win .
drop out , you bastard !
come on . !
thank you , reuben .
and you better keep an eye on your speedometer , harrison .
handy !

thank you very much .
the moose hat and everything .
but , irma , we discussed this .
i'm not campaigning .
i'm not .
what?
do you care about sally or not?
no ...
look , her going out with him is just ... it's a casual ...
call it postmenopausal intuition ... but just my opinion ...
lose this election , lose sally .
mm hmm .
it's not gonna go anywhere .
he's 20 years older than me .
he's the president !
so?
power takes 10 years off a man , handy .
rich , another 10 .
by the time you figure he's in great shape and you're not ... he's younger than you are .
mm hmm .
so , you want to campaign or not?
hmm !
mmm mmm mmm mmm !
better shape !
i know i can kick your ass !
up and running .
so how do we kick this thing off , bert?
top priority , obviously , is to keep him presidential .
just pound these moose worshippers ... with what his unbelievable experience can bring to them .
look , if they think about it for half a second ...
harrison can't bring even a fraction of what he brings .
whatever he is .
and what exactly is he?
preliminary research says that he is something ... that actually we've never faced before , mr. president .
and that is?
he's a genuinely honest man , sir .
oh , come on , grace .
all that means is he's never run for public office .
what do you got , bert?
f. b. i. , c. i. a ... nothing .
but this turned up in the local paper .
and , uh , that's it?
that's it .
we're running against the pie eating champ .
huh .
and think about this .
he runs for mayor , but only when he thinks he's unopposed .
he dates the same woman for six years ... but he never pops the question .
what's wrong with this picture?
he won't take risks . !
he won't make a commitment .
and any man who won't make a commitment shouldn't be mayor of anything .
that's good .
how do we get that out?
whisper campaign , at first .
then radio , and eventually , we'll have to have some tv spots .
shouldn't get too expensive , but ...
mr. president , i'm sure you don't want to hear this ... but would the easiest thing be ...
should we discuss a withdrawal?
withdrawal?
grace !
he's the eagle !
eagle cole has never run away from anything in his life !
not to mention what it would do to his finances .
finances?
book deals , corporate boards , library fund raising .
you quit or , god help us , lose to a plumber ... we can kiss those deals good bye faster than you can say roto rooter .
this is not about mooseport .
it's about winning .
it's about spending three million dollars to protect 20 .
maybe i should commit to that speaking tour .
l ...
i , uh ...
i had to cancel that , sir .
you ...
you what?
it it seemed obvious .
it was right in the middle of the campaign .
that was millions of dollars !
sir , there is still that offer ... from the soova motors people .
the ex president cannot do car commercials .
but have you seen the car?
look at this .
it's snappy styling , snappy president .
bullard . !
it's smooth handling .
leather interior !
bullard !
get out , get out .
i'll handle the money , eagle .
i'm sure that with the library pledges , something will turn up .
may i stay now , sir?
go in the corner , out of my eye line .
oh , thank you , sir .
i can still see you .
yes , sir .
what about the girl?
what about this sally handy , sally eagle wank off?
he'll have to cancel the date .
whoa , whoa .
no .
he can't cancel the date .
you said it , bert .
the eagle doesn't back down .
you clear up what i didn't know and when i didn't know it , i'll be fine .
should i draft a press release?
uh , yeah .
oh , no .
no .
um ...
call the press , have them over here first thing in the morning ... and then get handy harrison here to fix the toilet .
you see where i'm going with this , or do i have to draw you a picture?
i see it , mr. president .
i'm on it .
let's get to work .
he's comin 'in .
let's go .
let's go .
move on through .
move on .
oh , boy .
uh huh .
looks like an ambush .
oh , boy .
handy , what are your policies?
mr. president . !
mr. president . !
comments . !
folks , i need a word with mr. harrison .
good morning , handy .
good morning , mr. president .
you got toilet trouble , right?
yeah .
handy , uh , i want to make it clear that when i asked miss mannis out ...
i had no idea that you two had a relationship .
even though i find it reprehensible for any man to interfere in an ongoing romance ...
me too .
i also believe that a woman's heart is hers and hers alone to give .
ah .
yeah .
that's a good point .
mm hmm .
so , i asked sally out in ignorance ... and she agreed to go .
and until she tells me to stand down , i intend to see her .
fair?
call him a horndog !
did she say " horndog "?
well , uh ...
if it's okay with you , sir , i'd like to chew on that a bit .
okay .
okay , you chew on that ... and , um ... if you find that you can't swallow it , you let me know ... and i'll give you the heimlich maneuver , okay?
very good , sir .
come on in here and fix these toilets .
so are we going to see a date , mr. president?
where are you taking her?
i don't know what you're gonna see .
thank you so much .
thank you very much , ladies and gentlemen .
i'm in a great mood .
do we have any ice cream?
absolutely , sir .
and i think we found a way to solve your money problems .
really?
yes .
voil .
that's it?
nothing to it .
you save three million dollars , and look ... still beautiful .
excellent , excellent .
don't even miss it .
okay , everybody .
let's get back to work .
right away , sir .
son of a bitch !
sally !
plunger , you stay off the couch . !
hi there .
hello . !
hey .
hey , it's me .
what's up?
uh ... what are you doing?
you wanna go do something?
you wanna see a movie or something?
you know i have plans tonight .
l ...
oh , that's right .
that's right .
i forgot .
tonight's the night you got a date with the president of the united states .
uh huh .
did you see this?
local vet finds romance with past president .
eww .
where'd they get that picture?
yeah .
there it is next to the president on the front page .
so what about later?
i mean , he must go to bed at , like , 8 : 30 , right?
so , there's supposed to be a meteor shower at 11 : 00 .
that could be cool .
it'll have to be another time .
it's not gonna happen for 240 years , but okay , i'll pencil that in .
i might , uh ...
you gotta ...
you gotta tighten these .
look , if you're doing all this to get me jealous ... it's worked , okay , so could you stop it , huh?
please?
can you just cancel the date with the president?
so that's wednesday .
then thursday .
come in , come in , come in .
thank you , sir .
uh , thursday , i thought you could interview some of the ghostwriters .
oh , great , great , great , great .
where are you taking her?
the pig and the whistle , the only steakhouse in town .
supposed to be quiet , intimate .
do you know it?
pig 'n 'whistle?
no .
what do i eat?
i mean , what do i talk about?
do i have anything in common with this girl?
she's a veterinarian .
why don't you talk about mad cow disease?
don't , by the way , order meat .
why not?
it's just a guess , but she might not appreciate your wolfing down ... the animal she spent all day trying to save .
good point .
come on .
wh what , do you ... do you really actually like this guy?
he wants to talk to me about dogs .
why you all dressed up then?
because he's the president .
well , then why are you wearin 'black underwear?
were you lookin 'up my dress?
yeah , i was .
ow !
oh , get over yourself .
i hardly touched you .
how many times do i gotta tell you how strong you are?
you knuckled my bone !
listen , explain to me the underwear choice .
if you're not attracted ...
i don't believe this !
what difference does it make what color my underwear is?
it's an unconscious indicator ... of your subconscious intentions .
okay .
um ...
how do you feel about the pink?
no .
no .
uh ... what about these?
no !
no?
uh , these?
all right .
or do you like any of these?
i'm going to sears tomorrow .
i'm telling you right now .
oh !
remember these?
yeah .
that we're locking up , okay?
or you know what?
i could always go with none at all .
i wonder what that would indicate .
sally .
sally !

hello !
handy's hardware .
hello , pig 'n 'whistle .
no , this is handy's hardware .
good .
i'd like to confirm a reservation , please .

well , i'll be buggered by a bear .
ah , yes , you will .
look forward to seeing you there .
move up a little closer .
can you move that up?
this feels wrong .
and pushy .
and him making her his booty poodle isn't?
you have to stop saying that , please .
thank you .
to new friends .
lots of em .
this way , mr. president !
sorry about the gaggle .
i just can't believe they hound you like this .

mr. president !
hey yo !
my nose is making a whistling noise .
hey , handy . !

my fellow americans ... welcome to the first of two televised mayoral debates .

clay?
uh , some of them environment people ... have taken to callin 'ned barker's pond a wetlands .
i been fishing there for 30 years .
what's gonna happen?
good question .
clay ...
i was the most environmentally conscious president since teddy roosevelt .
human population will not threaten wildlife in this area ... for 200 years , if ever .
so you go right on fishing in that pond ... and if anybody tries to stop you , you send 'em to me .
right on , mr. president !
handy?
come on , handy .

oh , handy , come on .
i got a question .
my turn . !
my turn . !
morris . !
over here . !
uh , frances?
uh , for 10 years now ... we have needed a stop sign in front of lucy decker's house .
nyah , nyah , nyah .
she has done everything except burn down city hall to stop it .
if elected , what will you do about it?
first off ...
i would convene a commission to study the problem .
i would appoint a blue ribbon panel ... of traffic specialists , right of way attorneys and the army corps of engineers ... to assess the situation and make recommendations .
i would spare no effort to make our streets the safest in the world .
all right !
go get 'im , eagle . !
handy , your turn .
gotta go for it . !
that's well put , mr. president .
lucy , let me ask you , what's the problem?
car headlights .
ten years ago they tried a stop sign .
when cars on bay street stopped , their headlights stopped right on my headboard .
have you tried curtains?
excuse me?
you know , blackout curtains for your windows .
you'd probably sleep better , anyway .
well , i'd try that .
nobody ever suggested that .
well , you come by the store and we'll help you out .
good thinking , handy . !
i'll do that .
that's it , handy !
you tell 'em !
that a way , handy . !
dad .
dad .
mandy gutman?
dad , this is a question for handy .
is that okay?
well , if the president has no objection .
i reserve the right to respond , but no objection .
okay , mandy .
handy , i was just wondering ... now that sally is dating the president ...
does that mean that you're available?
okay , people , can we keep the questioning to the subject of the election?
i think joe had a question ...
actually , morris , i'd like to address the issue , if i might .
thank you .
uh , thanks , mandy , for that question .
sally ...
i know i might not be the best boyfriend , but ...
i thought we had a good thing going here .
you gotta know how much i care about you , right?
why else do you think i got so mad about the underwear with the president?
underwear?
tell us about the underwear !
was it a thong?
mr. president , what about it?
no , no , no , no . !
no , it's color ... it's a color thing .
sally !

i heard you talking about my underwear in front of the whole town .
the whole country .
that's how much i care .
you didn't answer the question .
what question?
is it me or him?
is it me or your new truck?
don't try to make this about me .
it's about you !
how is that about me?
ohh ...
miss mannis !
miss mannis !
man , she pushed you right down .
yeah , she's stronger than me .
it's not about me .
it's about you !
how is that about me?
well , you heard it here first .
it looks like sally is going to cast her ballot in favor of the president .
i'm christy adams , tvnn news .
yeah , baby , you're going down .
so , what do you think?
should i set up another date?
why not?
excuse me .
grace?
grace?
well , what's her problem?
maybe she saw the numbers .
you may have done all right with the girl , but the debate was a disaster .
what are you talking about?
this is impossible .
it's a small town , eagle .
the rules are different here .
uh , well , you guys are the hotshots .
brainstorm .
well?
uh ... sir?
excuse me .
mr. president?
yes?
we could eliminate him .
what?
you wanna make it look like an accident , of course .
maybe his brakes could go out .
oh , my god .
or he could slip on an oil slick .
what , are you insane?
uh , no , sir , i was ...
i was just brainstorming .
did i misunderstand the question?
thank god you guys are on our side .
thank you , sir .

hello .

i spent 25 years with monroe cole ... which is why i'm supporting handy harrison .
yes , you heard me .
i'm supporting handy harrison .
eagle?
have i gotten through to you , lambkins?
i never thought you'd stoop this low , harrison .
i thought this was gonna be a fair fight between two honorable men ... but i can see now that i'm up against somebody who doesn't play by the rules .
have you no sense of decency , sir?
i'm sorry .
talk about hitting below the belt .
bringing a man's ex wife into it .
you're showing your true colors , aren't you?
hey !
i had nothing to do with this .
mr. president !

mr. president !
you want a fair fight?
you just called me dishonorable , sir , a a and i'm not .
so if it's a fair fight you want ... just you and me ...
i think i know the place .

i just need a do over .
okay , handy , you're up about a million strokes .
it's the last hole .
how about double or nothing?
what's " double "?
what's " nothing "?
well , " nothing " is , uh , we're even , tie , status quo .
uh , " double " would be , uh , i back off sally , drop out of the mayor's race .
you got it .
okay .
go ahead .
you hit .
but , you know ... if i'm gonna risk , uh , all that ... you gotta give me something .
you gotta , uh ...
oh , i don't know ...
what?
one throw .
throw?
yeah , i get one throw .
because i can't play you even .
you got local knowledge here .
you're killing me .
he can't throw either .
bury him .
okay .
you get one throw .
but if we tie , i win .
well , you drive a hard bargain , but okay .
yeah , baby . !
there's the old form back .
okay .
what?
hey , what ... what are you doing?
hey !
what's that?
i said one throw .
i didn't say whose ball .
you're out of bounds .
click , click , click .
good morning , sir .
everything all right?
oh , just dandy .
i'm a 10 handicap , and i shot a 142 .
you and i have to have a serious talk about my handicap , miss sutherland .
now , mr. president?
later .
i heard you broke even .
at least you didn't lose .
the most humiliating round of my life .
time to take the gloves off , bert .
let's bury this guy .
well , sir , he's clean as a whistle .
oh , come on .
surely he did something .
knocked up a local , grew marijuana .
hell , i grew marijuana .
we'll find dirt , eagle , even if we have to make it up .
exactly .
i don't believe this .
what?
mr. president .
i'm giving my notice .
your notice?
yes .
i can't work here any longer .
are you drunk , for god's sakes?
we've been together 15 years .
yes , exactly .
and in all that time you have never once gone negative .
at least not first .
and you have never , ever stooped to threats or ... harassment .
grace , he brought in charlotte .
charlotte .
if that's not harassment , what is?
mr. president , you have two days ... two hours and 21 minutes ... until this election is over .
and then i'm gone .
what's that?
i think she quit , sir .
not that .
that .
oh , this?
it's a new poll .
five points .
five?
down .
what's the sample size?
come on , bert .
what's the sample size?
everybody .
everybody?
this is a disaster . !
not to pile on , sir , but i'm worried about the book deals too .
aw , crap .
it's like some mythic greek puzzle .
the riddle of the handyman .
somewhere , the answer .
sir , let's not panic .
this isn't over .
wait a minute .
wait a minute .
what's wrong with us?
what?
i'll give it to him .
it's that simple .
wait .
you don't mean quit .
i'll give it to him .
it's that simple .
wait .
you don't mean quit .
you can't quit , eagle .
i wouldn't be quitting .
that's the beauty of it .
i'll say how qualified he is , how he's the best man for the job .
and tonight , at the debate , i'll throw him my support .
if i win , i win .
but if i lose , it's because i made the most magnanimous gesture in political history ... and people took my advice .
that's brilliant , sir .
thank you .
and then i'd get the girl .
uh ...
sally .
sally !
right .
sally .
hey , hi .
i'm ...
i'm here .
i'm getting ready for the debate .
you wanna come in?
no , i'm gonna get goin '.

what's going on?
what's all this stuff?
oh .
i , um ...
i won reuben in a putting contest ... so i have to make room for some of his stuff .
you ... what?
i know .
i mean , can you imagine someone actually playing golf to win a person?
now , look ...
no .
don't insult me by trying to defend this ...
'cause if i let myself dwell on it , i am really gonna lose it .
but , sally , it wasn't ...
i said don't .
easy .
i just wanna settle this amicably .
okay?
there's your stuff .
my stuff?
wh ...
hold on , hold on .
this is yours .
remember?
from me .
christmas .
don't you remember?
that was the year the power went out .
we had that big snowstorm .
we were so frustrated .
we couldn't turn this on and watch it .
then the power came back and we turned it on , and ... and you looked so beautiful ... by the light of it .
and then we ...
you know .
by the light of it .
i remember .
and then we stayed up all night and talked .
yeah .
yeah .
do you remember what we talked about?
no .
the future .
we talked about the future , handy .
sally , wait .
i don't wanna wait anymore .
good luck at the debate .
are you coming?
she's not coming .
all right , guys , that's it .
two minutes .
we go in two minutes .
two minutes , mr. president .
excuse me , sir .
my hands are shaking .
i can't even go to the bathroom .
i'll pee all over the place .
relax , honey .
i'm not ready for this .
two minutes , handy .
yeah .
be on your toes .
be sharp .
you may have won the first debate , but he's a python .
gentlemen , i believe we're ready .
it's starting !
live , from the seaport town of mooseport , maine ... the mayoral debates ... with your candidates monroe " eagle " cole ... and harold " handy " harrison .
we take you now to your moderator , avery hightower .
good evening .
i'm avery hightower .
i am honored to moderate ... the second and final mooseport mayoral debate .
as is tradition , we will start with a game of rock paper scissors ...
handy !
not scissors .
gentlemen .
uh , mr. hightower , could i ...
i'd like to make a statement first , if that's okay .
mr. president?
no , that's fine .
i have a statement also .
just ...
okay?
thank you .
yes .
gentlemen .
hey .
hi , everybody .
hi , handy .
i just wanna say one thing .
i'm a little embarrassed ... about the way i've been running my campaign .
ohh !
an election , it shouldn't be about personalities .
you know?
or ...
or golf .
or who we're dating .
sally , if you're watching this ...
i was wrong to bring our relationship into this .
i'm sorry .
mmm .
i guess i did it again .
i just brought our relationship into it again .
so i'm sorry for that ... too .
i guess what i want to say , folks , is ...
i think an election should be about the town , about what we need ... and how we can work together to get things done .
the president can do great things for us .
son of a ...
bitch .
having him as a mayor , that's an opportunity that we can't pass up , folks .
yeah .
right . !
tomorrow morning i'm going to the polls ... and i'm casting my vote for the president ...
monroe cole ... for the mayor of mooseport .
son of a bitch !
ladies and gentlemen ... what you've just seen ... is a selfless act .
handy harrison ... is ...
mooseport .
he ...
he is mooseport .
he knows its problems , he knows its pulse ... he knows its plumbing ... as only a person who lives here can .
so tomorrow morning ...
i'm going to the polls .
i'm walking into that booth and opening that ballot ... that simple piece of paper ... that our forefathers gave their lives to secure ...
and i'm casting my vote for harrison .
harold " handy " harrison .
let's hear it . !
man , he's good .
mm hmm .
well , what you've just seen , ladies and gentlemen , is politics at its finest .
politics as it should be .
you did good .
i felt like i had to do that .
harrison .
hey .
that was something , mr. president .
you son of a bitch .
you knew i was gonna do that , so you did it first .
i didn't know that .
how could i know that?
you bugged me !
what we have just witnessed here , on this rare night ...
you bugged me !
i'm not doing anything !
is a show of decency ...
let me go !
a show of inclusiveness ...
ow . !
let go of my arm . !
a show of mutual respect .
let go of me !
it's time to follow their example .
it's time to ...
let go of me . !
let go of me . !
mr. president , are you okay?
i'm gonna get it off !
oww . !
bullard . !
get it off me . !
so , danny , you see that debate last night?
did i. was anybody hurt?
what?
miraculously not .
apparently only minor bruises and abrasions .
what happened?
they're saying it was a freak accident .
yeah , very freaky .
apparently , the stage rigging snapped ... and fell on the candidates while they were shaking hands .
wow .
well , you know what we say .
it's mooseport . !
polls open in 20 minutes , mr. president .
how about a little music to vote by?
good idea . !
good morning , sir .
morning , mr. president .
cloud , pull over here , will you .
how's your nose?
it's okay .
how's your lip?
and your back?
it's just the lip , and , uh ... it's fine .
well , i just ... assumed your back hurt ... with , you know , irma jumping on it .
well ... see you at the polls .
wanna hit a few?
what , just hit 'em into the water?
yeah .
martha's into scuba ... and in the spring she puts on a wet suit and she goes and gets 'em .
somehow or another , i can't picture martha in a wet suit .
yeah , well , you're lucky .
i can't not picture it .
all right .
oh . !
you topped , pulled and hooked it all in one .
here .
let me show you ...
mr. president , you've shaken a lot of hands .
shake hands with the club .
like this?
yes .
now , just look at the ball ... and picture like it's the former first lady .
just whack it .
blood sucking vampire .
aah !
wow . !
you two had issues .
oh , jesus !
so , uh ... how come you didn't ask her?
ask her what?
you know .
oh .
well ...
i don't know .
i probably should have .
scared , i guess .
well , marriage is a scary thing .
i'd be the first one to tell you that .
but once in a while there comes along that special girl .
no , i mean , that's just it .
she is special .
i just figured ... eventually ... she'll find somebody else .
and , you know , you always hope that next guy will be some loser ... not the president .
handy , on the 16th hole of our match ... you laid up .
yeah .
i remember .
i did .
you played it safe .
so?
you ended up in the water .
i never would have been president of the united states ... if i'd laid up .
sometimes you just gotta go for the green .
let's go vote .
out of the way . !
here he is . !
hold them back !
mr. president , over here . !
please , we have some questions . !
good morning , ladies and gentlemen .
please step back .
no comments today .
no questions .
okay , thanks .
thank you .
okay .
please . !
one question . !
kindly walk in over there .
the pageantry of democracy is working .
that's why we love mooseport so much .
once a politician ...
always a politician .
it's 10 minutes past the hour ... and there are 20 minutes left before the polls close in mooseport , maine .
with the former president's campaign spending millions ... on tv , radio and print advertising ... it's an amazing feat that handy harrison's grass roots campaign ... still has him neck and neck ...
it was so beautiful .
hello .
oh .
spectacular , isn't it?
i was thinking about ...
for once don't talk , please .
what?
just listen .
okay?
can you do that?
a long while back ... my mom asked me what i saw in you .
you probably find it hard to believe that anybody could ask such a thing ... but she did .
i see a man i admire , " i told her .
a flawed man , certainly , but a man with principles .
since this handy thing ...
i've seen a man ... who only cares about ego and power ... a man who will stoop to anything ... to win a position he doesn't even want ... from someone he probably shouldn't even beat .
and it angers me , and it upsets me .
oh , and mostly it just makes me sad .
grace ...
because ... you used to be better than that , monroe .
you really were .
and that is no handshake , you son of a bitch .
sugar , mr. president?
oh , uh , three , please .
no , no , no .
one .
good morning , mr. president .
good morning .
where's grace?
i don't know , sir .
could you find her , please?
yes , sir .
let's go .
eagle , we gotta get moving .
they want you down in town for the announcement .
announcement?
i can't expose myself to an announcement without knowing who won .
they won't tell me , eagle .
i've done everything short of bribing them ... with a year's supply of beer and night crawlers ... but i'll get down there and work on it .
get on that toga and get down to that circus , eagle .
please , sir .
sally , um ...
handy . !
you back here?
uh , hey .
it's time , man .
yeah , i know .
don't you want to find out if you won or lost ... badly?
i'm gonna ...
yeah , go ahead .
no , i'll wait for ya .
i'm gonna meet you there .
i want to .
no , go .
you're my ride , man .
come on !
okay .
all right .
let's go .
in a few moments ...
former president cole and harold " handy " harrison are due to arrive .
will big politics and big money carry the day , or will the little man prevail?
we shall soon see .
testing . !
testing , testing . !
we're just about ready to start .
and , uh ...
ah !
i think i see the president coming now !
whoo hoo !
and , oh , there's handy .
hey ...
hey , did you see sally?
no .
hmm .

through the drain?
just one second .
look , sally ...
i was gonna prepare this whole speech ...
what?
i was gonna prepare this whole speech ... but i think it's better if i just say this out of the moment .
all right .
the truth is , you're beautiful .
and you're smart and wonderful .
and ...
and i'm not ...
i'm not .
handy ...
hang on , 'cause i'm ...
i'm in the moment now .
this whole thing , it's made me take a pretty hard look at myself .
and i'm not smart , a and i'm not beautiful , but ... but , hell , i just beat the most popular president in history .
so ...
maybe i'm okay .
almost .
you almost beat him .
sally , between me and you ... just our little secret ...
i beat him .
do you think i would've voted for myself after i told the whole town i wouldn't?
you gave it away?
why?
because he needs it .
i don't .
l ...
i only need you .
that's ...
that's my speech .
oh , handy .
hold on .
i got ...
i got you something .
dirt?
no , it's ...
it's ...
it's dirty , but ...
oh .
look , i don't know how you feel ...
is that a " yes " kiss?
yes .
it's dirty , but it's ... it's really ... it's beautiful .
it's beautiful .
it's , uh , big and ...
that's not just one diamond .
there's diamonds on the side .
there's diamonds and mud .
oh , did i say in the speech ...
i forgot the whole part about how much i love you .
i didn't say it , but yes ...
i didn't ...
you know , there's no ...
i didn't make a word thing out of it , but you can't even measure it .
it's like ...
like , if you take the sun ...
you could take the heat from that sun , and you ...
if you put all of that in a love container , you'd ...
got it .
did you get it?
yes .
but you said yes anyway , so this is all extra , like a bonus .
let's go .
my heart's beating fast .
plunger , come on !
come on . !
how'd it get in the sewer?
oh , that's ...
you know .
things just happen to me .
did i happen to notice you're wearing a thong?
oh . !
oh . !
oh , my god . !
are you okay?
you did it again .
i barely touched you .
okay , look , if this marriage is gonna work ... you're gonna have to realize how strong you are .
you're stronger than me .
just accept it .
i'm not stronger than you .
yes , you are .
i'm a girl .
that's right .
so it hurts physically and emotionally .
come on , boys .
oh .
