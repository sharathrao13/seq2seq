the one closest to you on a horse
jake , jake , listen
get back on your horse move ! move !
wait , i remember the rest of the story
what are you talking about?
it's an ancient folklore it's been passed down
jake !
they tortured and killed her ancestors
to get their hands on the spell
give me that stupid book !
jake , you gotta understand something
this is not about the story it's about you and her
you want to rescue her what's wrong with that?
she's part of the story
she's still there , isn't she?
the queen , she's been in the tower for centuries now
waiting for someone
to serve her?
to scare the children?
now that's not the truth , angelica i know it believe it
ignore him , he wishes his old life was something out of a book
and now he thinks he's in love
shut upwill !
angelica , leave the village now

the idea of going back in there
nothing makes sense there ..
like being inside jake's head

the thing is , i can't  protect him
my father's gonna protect his family too
jake .. jake , come back
