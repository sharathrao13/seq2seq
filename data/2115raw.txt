an eight year old boy from manhattan ... was delivered dead|on arrival today
the centers for disease control .
are we dealing with an epidemic?
whatever the carrier, |we know that it's not the water .
we don't believe|that it's airborne .
one , two , three , four
strickler's disease|was first diagnosed two years ago .
we're no better off now .
i needed you|to see this for yourself , dr. tyler .
it's the same|at every hospital in the city .
for the lucky ones, |it's a lifetime in leg braces .
most of these kids|won't make it .
we need your help .
strickler's disease|came to new york ...
like a thief in the night, |threatening to steal ... an entire generation of our children|from before our eyes .
dr. peter mann , deputy director|of the centers for disease control
the killer was cunning . |it was deadly .
neither a cure|nor a vaccine could be found .
we at the cdc|had to contain it ... before it could spread|beyond manhattan island .
so we went after its carrier, |the common cockroach .
or rather she did .
dr. susan tyler is the reason|that there hasn't been ... a new case of strickler's|in this city for six months .
dr. susan tyler .
dr. susan tyler, |professor of entomology ... at the new york state university .
thank you , peter .
i don't think i need to tell you|new yorkers just how resilient ... the common cockroach is .
since it has proven to be|virtually immune to chemical control , we had to find|a new avenue of attack .
so , with the aid of genetics labs|across the country , we recombined termite and mantis dna|to create a biological counteragent , a new species to be|our six legged ally ... in wiping out|the roach population .
we call it|the " judas " breed .
once in contact with|the judas 'secretions , the common roaches|were infected with an enzyme ... which caused their metabolism|to go into overdrive . | come on , susan !
you're missing it . | no matter how much|the common roaches ate , every last member|of the nest ... starved to death|within a matter of hours .
i hope someone's taping this .
this announcement's been|a long time coming ,
ladies and gentlemen . | coming home .
the strickler's outbreak|has officially been contained .
the epidemic is over .
hey , susan . |honey .
any other questions? | dr. mann , what did this victory|mean to you personally?
it means that i can|move on to other projects with the , uh
our 15 minutes are gone .
and personally , um, |it's where i met my wife .
what is this?
is this|some kind of catholic guilt thing?
we don't even know|what the impact is of what we did .
the impact is that ... a lot of kids will be running around|next year because of you .
a lot of kids .
maybe we get lucky .
maybe a couple|of them'll be ours someday .
oh , a couple , huh? | mm hmm .
oh , okay . |we're not rushing things .
i didn't want to overtax you . |it's been a hard year .
it's been a great year .
oxfords . |seven and a half .
black . |leather soles .
funny , funny shoes .
funny , funny shoes .
funny , funny shoes .
funny , funny shoes .
funny
cdc .
cdc .
hey , boss, |welcome to disease land .
tuck it in . | all right .
all right .
are you sure this is yellow fever?
what , are you ignoring your pages now? | listen , l
okay , these two cops|saw the broken scaffold, |and then the paint mess here .
and then they looked|through that cellar window .
go ahead . |take a look .
pleasant , isn't it?
couldn't let 'em out|until you gave me the okay , so
roughly , there were|three dozen people trapped in here .
we got bacterial samples reading off|the scale , though nothing's airborne .
we got a reverend harry ping .
preacher , if you can imagine that . |he ran this place .
well , there's|no sign of him .
oh , have you had lunch? | uh huh .
try to keep it down|when you see this , okay?
piece of shit|on the ceiling .
hmm?
figure that one out . | here you go , josh .
the subway?
you know what? l l |this is what i love about my job .
i get to travel, |see the world ... and meet new exotic cultures .
it's it's all bacterial, |but hey , what the fuck , right?
thanks a lot , miguel . | board up every exit .
if this leads to the subways, |i don't want anything to spread .
quarantine everything .
what's going on , remy?
oh , i'm just ... commemorating|my sad moments .
so , we're at this|great restaurant .
i'm thinking , finally, |a fucking gentleman .
i go to the ladies 'room . |i come back .
i catch the schmuck slipping|a half ounce of sedatives into my drink .
what a pervert .
this city is full of perverts .
you don't know who|anybody is anymore .
jesus , i look like shit . | hey , guys .
you the bug lady , right?
we're here to deal .
when you pick them up, |you should pick 'em up by|this front vein on the wing ,
'cause it's the strongest part|of the wing .
see , that way|you don't break it .
now , let's see what else|you have in here .
oh , look .
what do we have here? | swallowtail?
excellent . | how come you like bugs so much?
just imagine that|you're one of them .
what , eating furniture and stuff? |that's gotta suck .
no , no , no . |now , don't judge them too quickly .
these guys were building castles|while dinosaurs were still|wimpy little lizards .
now , say you're him .
he's what we call a soldier .
now , there is no way|that you would ever quit fighting , no matter how badly injured|you were .
it would be|a battle to the death .
but most insects don't kill ... unless their territory is invaded .
you'd just stun|your prey up here .
and then you drag it|all the way down through here to there , into what is kind|of like a pantry .
will he eat it alive?
yeah .
they're not really squeamish|about those kind of things .
this is the nest . |it's the heart of the colony .
the big enchilada .
why? | well , if anything were|to happen to the nest , the entire colony|would die out .
i'd just bail and start my own .
well , you couldn't do that .
see ... that big guy there? |next to the queen?
wait .
look over there .
he's the king .
and out of all the nest, |he's the only fertile male .
he got a good deal .
yeah .
it's a simple structure|designed for their survival .
it's perfectly balanced, |and it's very beautiful .
whatever peels|your banana , lady .
so , you wanna buy|the butterflies , or what?
you know what?
you guys have done a really good job . |so , how about five bucks?
that's your best?
i'm gonna show her the weird bug . | costs a dollar just to look .
it's a really great bug . |got it on the subway .
we kind of broke it a little . | okay .
my best offer .
ten bucks for everything, |plus a specimen jar, |some tweezers and some mounts .
deal .
are you crazy?
this is the best . |this is our meal ticket .
come on . |bug's almost dead anyway .
it's yours .
you gave 'em ten bucks . | they're from alphabet city .
there's much worse things|they could be selling .
oh , no .
your papers . |help me get the window .
susan .
push . h , come on . | oh , i hate this window .
okay , on three . |one , two , three .
who the hell do you think you are , putting my two officers|on quarantine?
listen to me , captain . |those two , they go home , they kiss their wives, |they kiss their kids , and i'm the one with|a full blown epidemic
come on , chuy .
we have to make dinner .
dinner . |i don't care .
i do care ! |jesus , god , i hate cops .
they make the worst coffee .
shiny wire . |still giving you a hard time?
as always . | don't stare . |people look back if you stare .
it's not polite .
i can't believe this . | what?
i spend an hour in the field . |i get a weekend's worth of crap .
oh , speaking of that . |that turd that i took to the lab?
i found these in it .
what are they?
buttons . | buttons?
maybe they needed fiber .
sorry .
wow .
oh , my god . |you're just a baby .
oh , my god .
the transfer|of recombinant genetic material ... from termites and mantis|into judas breed will allow|rapid enzymatic change ... insuring 100 % sterility|in all judas females ... utilization|of a suicide gene ... leading to a life expectancy|of 120 to 180 days .
hmm .
not too little ... and not too much .
you rub it in .
around and around .
like this , huh?
let the leather take it .
funny shoes .
aieee . |mr .
funny shoes .
no one is there .
it's empty .
chuy , listen to me .
they have jesus|on the cross , but that is not|a holy place .
can you call me back tonight?
thanks , officer .
cops are on it .
good .
well , they said
can you do me a favor and hold off|working at night for awhile?
i can't do that .
i was actually|thinking i had to get back
susan , someone broke into|your office , okay?
i'm sorry about you losing a specimen , but let's try and get|our priorities straight . | this is not just a specimen .
i did a ph test, |and there are only two species ... that match what i found .
now , one of them|is a leaf cutter ant in the amazon .
the other one|we released here three years ago .
you said
y y you said the ones we released|only had a life span of six months .
we engineered them|to be sterile adults .
the judases were not supposed to last|past one generation .
so what happened? | the one i examined today was a baby .
they were designed to die . |they are breeding .
i shine them good .
chuy , black lincoln . |chuy?
black lincoln . |this one .
chuy , pay attention , please .
this is where|you found the bug?
yeah , man . |but they changed the lock .
you sure you haven't|seen one of those?
no .
what is it?
it's an ootheca .
it's kind of|a fancy name for an egg case .
there's probably more, |like , weird bugs inside of it .
no way . |i see one of those , i puke .
here you go .
here . | hold on .
is there money to be made|on this egg thing?
sorry . | dealing days are over .
vamonos .
these egg things look nasty .
thought you liked|finding nasty things .
well , what if we go find these things . |she'll pay us , right?
is that all you think about?
come on .
this bug . |what does it look like?
did you hear that?
how deep does this go? | let's see .
let's take a look .
you see anything? | not yet .
shit .
i dropped it .
i can't reach it .
let me try . |my hands are smaller .
just leave it . | well , no .
wait . |i think i'm almost there .
how much you think the bug lady'll|give us for this egg thing?
at least a 20 spot .
jesus !
fucking moles !
hey !
got any change? | get a job , scag .
hey , kid ! |get the hell off the tracks !
hey , how about a quarter? | get off my tracks ! |that's where he is .
long john . |that's where he is .
long john .
don't be talking to the moles .
they messed up . | hey , moles !
eat my long john !
look , i already told you|this is cdc business .
and i'm telling you that|those lockers are mta business .
okay , we'll we'll pay for the lock|that we broke , officer .
i mean , whatever we can do | lady , who am i talking to now?
you or him? | you're talking to me , okay? |you're talking to me .
all we wanna see is
see what?
that's|the old maintenance bridge , buddy .
this insect|that we are looking for
look , man .
your lady want a bug ... or it's eggs , or whatever she wants, |that's fine by me .
but it's like|swiss cheese down there .
tunnels in , tunnels out, |old tracks .
you go messing around , break your neck, |and it's my ass on the line .
lace up shoes .
black .
nine west .
chuy , finish your sandwich .
it's good . |it's chicken .
penny loafers .
eleven .
double e.
hey .
he's really good at that . | oh , yes .
he imitates anything .
doesn't he go to school?
he doesn't need school .
he's special .
what you making there? |is that a superhero?
mr. funny shoes .
he knows everything|about shoes .
hey , i'm talking to you . | no , you're talking at me
you come back with|the proper permits .
maybe we'll have a conversation . | great .
we'll do lunch .
yeah , i look forward to it .
uptown .
what happened?
napoleon is alive and well|and working for the mta .
we have to get down there .
he wants a permit? |i'll give him a real special one .
ah , what's that?
is that the egg thing?
give me a hand .
oh , man , that smells .
i can hear the bugs inside .
come on .
cut it . |she's gonna give us at least 40 bucks .
what's up?
i think there's|a guy down there .
oh , shit .
oh , shit ! |it's got me !
help !
oh , god , please ! |please , help me !
alex !
a philosopher named hobbes|once wrote that ,
life , by its very nature, |is nasty , brutish and short .
can i eat it|or will it eat me?
it's this kind of simplicity ... that governs the phylum insecta .
hello?
it's me .
i got the permits . | you did?
we're going down|first thing tomorrow . | okay , that's great .
listen , honey , i i gotta go right now . |i'll call you later . ... or of cellular phones, | okay . as my distinguished colleague|can tell you .
so , you think your little frankenstein|has got the better of you?
i was hoping|you could tell me .
i really need to find|some answers , walter .
dear susan , is it answers you want from me, |or is it absolution?
you still think|making the judases was wrong?
three years ago, |i would've called it unforgivable .
but i have two grandchildren who are|alive today probably because of you .
it would be a tad hypocritical ... for me to pass judgement .
that's not an answer , walter .
it's not an easy question .
but as to the judases ,
i think it's likely|some survived .
evolution has a way|of keeping things alive .
but they all died in the lab .
yes , susan . |but you let them out ... into the world .
the world's a much bigger lab .
funny shoes .
yeah . | hi , peter .
it's remy .
yeah , hi . | is susan there?
i need to talk to her .
how you doin '? | fine .
huh? | it's really important .
yeah , sure .
what are you doing?
what do you got there?
where? | right down there .
in your hand .
nothing . | oh , are we testing it?
maybe . | mm hmm .
are we testing it? | uh huh , maybe . |i don't know .
could be .
it's remy . | oh , good .
okay .
so give me the phone .
come on .
come here .
give me the phone .
are we testing it? |can you hold on , remy? | yes .
hey .
what's up?
they found what? | at the water filtration plant .
what's going on? | okay , i'll be there in, |in about 20 minutes .
okay .
bye . | okay .
bye .
how long you got?
patience .
we'll just try again .
try again .
you know , sometimes these things|can be wrong .
that's okay . |i gotta go , okay?
bye , babe .
susan , we got|the subway thing today .
yeah , i know .
i i'm just gonna have|to meet you there when i'm done .
wait .
when you're done from what?
uh , boots , toys , uh , beer bottles , body parts, |cocaine filled condoms , uh , little baby alligators .
shit , you wouldn't believe|the stuff i'd seen .
yep .
they flush 'em down . |we fish 'em out .
but this thing . |we didn't know what this was .
we were thinking about throwing it away, |but then i remembered remy .
jeremy plays bass in my band .
ah . | anyway .
so , uh
yep .
i remember|remy says to me ,
if it's got more than four legs, |it's not a mammal .
it's a lobster , right?
my father saw me stay in bed , he'd go get the pitcher|of cold water , and whoosh !
i tell you, |that's some alarm clock .
wow .
how big did you say these bugs are? | come on .
hurry up .
you know , my shift's almost over . |i need my beauty sleep .
man , if i'm blowing off|my saturday , then so are you .
yeah .
it looks like somebody|requested you for overtime .
come on .
hurry up . |let's find these things .
we've got a long way to go .
all right . |watch your step there .
we've got burrows going|down seven stories here .
no shit? | oh , yeah .
it's five stories down , partner .
you fall , i don't wanna|come back and pick you up .
okay , it's all yours . |go ahead .
it's 48 hours anyway . |i can't wait that long .
it's 48 hours .
now listen, |you got something to write with?
yes , yes .
i write it . | you gotta write this down .
come on .
here's the case number . |it's two seven
wait a sec .
two , seven . |yes , two seven
eight three . | eight three .
all right .
you got that? | what does this mean , case number?
it means i deal with you|in 48 hours , okay?
mr. funny shoes .
chuy !
hi , doc . |susan sent you some homework .
chuy?
chuy?
chuy?
chuy?
chuy?
people actually|do live down here?
yeah , man . |the mole people .
this section was pretty popular|all the way to fulton street .
tweeked out crackheads, |dopeheads , shitheads , mental cases .
then suddenly , poof ! |all gone .
rumors got started . |someone found a couple of stiffs .
yeah , they make up|some crap about a killer .
overcoat slim , long john .
now , down here is the land of talk .
the wildest version|goes the farthest .
hold it right here . |you got it?
i see
what's this?
look !
the organs are ... |perfectly formed .
they were functional .
i'm guessing here, |and , of course , they don't have a , uh, |a complete specimen , but
what do you think it is?
this thing ... |is not just some random mutation .
it's a highly evolved|soldier caste , formidable killer .
it couldn't have developed|in a vacuum .
it's part of a colony .
this way , this way .
should have stayed|at the office .
how much longer do we have to go? | keep looking around .
it's the size of your palm .
aw , man .
take a whiff .
god , it smells like acid . | no .
it's ammonia .
hey , guys .
huh?
there's some weird shit here .
what kind of weird shit?
lots of it .
god !
man !
go ahead and ask him .
ask .
what the you seen anything|like this before?
why're you asking me if i've ever seen|some shit like this before?
do i look like i've seen|some shit like this before?
hell , no , i ain't never seen|no shit like this before !
who the fuck would wanna climb up|these walls and hang one of these?
must've been a big|elephant ass motherfucker . |i don't know who the fuck
the delancey street station|will be closing in five minutes .
please find alternate routes|to your destination .
carlito? |yeah?
oh , come on , peter . |hurry up .
um , do you have the time?
sir , the time?
oh .
you know , my father always|wanted me to become a dentist .
i said , " no way .
i'm not gonna spend my life|looking into people's open mouths .
what could be worse|than that , right?
oh , man, |i've never been this deep .
this is the old|armory station .
hey , they built it|around the turn of the century .
it's been closed for decades .
yeah , i guess we covered everything . | hey , look .
you got your shit . |i'm happy for you .
let's get the hell|outta here , huh?

hey , show that to the station manager .
tell him leonard said he's gonna|have his bubble butt if he don't|have someone down here in ten
wait a second . |i can't find my way back alone .
look , look , look . |just go back the same way we came .

you need a whole crew|down here to do that . | what is your problem , man?
do you need a memo|every time you take a shit? | oh , don't go there .
you better be careful|how you speak to people .
josh?
he wouldn't be|comin 'from there .

close the door !
close the fuckin 'door !
what the fuck was that?
come on .
here .
here , here , here ! | just wait a minute !
fuck it !
you wait a minute ! |i wanna make sure ! | it's not dead .
yeah , well , it's gonna be ! |very soon , lady !
there it is . |drag it out .

you better tell me ... what the hell's|goin 'on around here .
oh , man .

everything's gonna be okay .
ah , christ .
josh will be here soon . |he'll bring us some help . | you're dreamin ', man .
if your boy was comin 'back, |he'd have been here by now .
they got his ass , man . |they ate his ass , man . | we don't know that .
and if you think there's not|another one of those things out there , what has been puttin'|that shit all over the walls?
listen , leonard . |if you keep on screaming like that , we're gonna meet|the rest of its family .
manny? |manny , be careful .
it it's dead . | no , no , no .
i emptied two clips|into that thing and it kept comin '.
wait , wait a second . |help me turn it over .
peter , these are lungs .
what the hell is she talkin 'about?
biology 101 .
you know, |insects don't have lungs .
that's what limits their size . | the secretions are the same .
oh , god
when i increased|the judas's metabolism , i must|have sped up its breeding cycle .
i mean , we're talking tens, |hundreds of thousands of generations .
i mean , who knows how many mutations . | listen , l
i just don't fuckin 'get this . |how could the
how could the judas|evolve into this?
think generations , not years , okay?
it took only 40, 000 generations|for apes to turn into humans . | so?
we changed its dna , peter . |i mean , we don't know what we did !
wait a minute !
wait a minute ! |wait a minute !
hold on !
if that thing has|been around , how come |how come nobody's ever seen it?
i think we have .
sometimes an insect will evolve|to mimic its predator .
a fly can look like a spider .
a caterpillar|can look like a snake .
the judas evolved|to mimic its predator .
us .
nobody up there knows about this?
nobody would . |not until it's too late .
these things can imitate us .
they can infiltrate us|and breed a legion before|anyone would even notice .
how |how could you do this?
how |how could you do this?
you you take something|and you you make it like a man .
a man who's not a man , he's a | manny !
he's a thing ! | manny !
that steals my child !
manny , you tell her, |'cause she don't give a goddamn . | hey , hey , hey .
your kid's gone . | hey , shut up .
my leg's chewed up all over ! | shut up , will ya?
shut the fuck up !
and they're both talkin'|about insects with lungs ! | shut up !
oh , shit ! |they're everywhere !
manny , get over here !
it's the blood !
the smell of the blood|is driving them crazy ! | oh , shit !
we have to cover the scent !
manny , give me your razor . |give me your razor !
here .
take it . |rub it on the windows .
anywhere where there's cracks . | wha
just do it ! | what?
oh !
what the |ah !
what is it?
scent glands .
insects use them|to identify themselves .
here .
rub it|all over yourself .
they won't attack you|if they think you're one of them .
manny !
it worked .
do you mind if
go ahead .
manny , give me your lighter .
look . |this is where we are .
now , these tunnels|may lead to the surface .
yes . | if we can get ... this car moving, |we might be able to make it .
what
what do you mean , might?
i mean , probably .
but even if they do , th this thing's been down here|rotting for half a century .
how do you know it'll move? | listen to me .
listen .
this car is a cr 17|from coney island .
believe me , it was made to last .
now , manny , there's a track relay switch|in this room here .
you switch the tracks . |that'll get us going . | yes , i'll try .
i'll try . | do .
there's a fuse box|down the tracks .
if i can rewire it, |i can juice up the whole system .
leonard , man .
look at yourself , l | i'll do it .
hey , if you talk me through it, |i'll go out there . | all you've gotta do is
no , no , no , no . |i'll go .
i'll go .
why?
i know much more about|what's out there than you do .
you're right .
you understand the creature , and , uh ,
leonard knows the subway , so so this is the way|it's gotta be .
whatever happens , it's manny and me . | why?
you two have gotta stay on this car .
you gotta get back up .
you gotta undo this .
so , i'll go .
we'll go .
