it's twenty after , dear .
darlin '?

what about you?
i'm all set .
i just ironed my sling .
the lawyer said 9 . 30 sharp , darlin '.
ok .
i hope you're not the miserly kind .
it's brand new .
she ought to get a very good price for it .
ls that the right mileage?
23 miles?
we only took two rides in it .
it's the darn men .
they run into her just to start a conversation .
will you come up , lz?
sure , dear .
don't go by appearances .
it's brand new .
it was a divorce present from her husband .
they givin 'presents for divorces now?
why not?
on the anniversary of our divorce , my husband always sends me ... .. one potted yellow rose , and it'll be 19 years in july .
course , he never did pay me the alimony .
but i wouldn't wanna put a man out , you know , if his heart's not in it .
you break your arm in the car?
no .
my last roomer , the one before mrs taber , we celebrated her divorce and ... .. l misbehaved .
i'm so sick and tired of myself .
will you go over my answers again?
sure , dear .
but don't worry , you'll do wonderfully .
let's see .
did your husband , mr raymond taber , ... .. act toward you with cruelty?
darlin '?
well , yes .
just say yes .
yes .
ln what way did this cruelty manifest itself?
he persistently ...
how does that go again?
he persistently and cruelly ignored my personal wishes and my rights , ... .. and resorted on several occasions to physical violence against me .
he persistently ...
oh , do i have to say that?
why can't i just say he wasn't there?
he ...
you could touch him , but he wasn't there .
lf that was grounds for divorce , ... .. there'd only be about 1 1 marriages left in the us .
now just repeat after me .
" he persistently ...
he persistently ...
they'll call in their estimate , ma'am .
those dents aren't my fault , you know .
i'll recommend the best price i can , ma'am .
you can drive her now .
i've put in a new battery .
i'll never drive that car again .
let's take a taxi .
i ...
i'll give you a lift if you're leaving right away .
swell .
two minutes .
lz , get dressed !
you gotta be my witness .
this'll be my 77th time i've witnessed for a divorce .
two sevens that's lucky , darlin '!
oh , lz , i hope .
easy does it , now .
oh , you're a dear .
here we are .
thanks a lot .
we've gotta go now .
lf you're not goin 'back east right away , i'd be glad to show you the county .
beautiful country around here , you know .
well , i don't know where i'll be , but ok .
thanks again .
my name is lsabelle steers .
lsabelle .
well , ok , you come along too .
that's a sweet afterthought !
you reno men !
i can't memorise this .
it's not the way it was .
just say it .
it doesn't have to be true .
this isn't a quiz show , it's only a court .
i just got off the plane ...
i don't wanna hear anything .
just give me five minutes .
after two years , five minutes ...
you can't have me now , so you want me , that's all .
please , i'm not blaming you .
it's ...
i just don't believe in the whole thing any more .
kid , i understand .
i understand ...
you don't understand .
you're not there , raymond .
lf i'm gonna be alone , i wanna be by myself .
go back .
you're not gonna make me feel sorry for you any more .
gay !
wait up !
i was just goin 'over to see ya !
well , good luck now , susan .
i won't forget you , you can be sure of that .
i don't even know where to write you .
general delivery .
i'll get it .
will you think about it?
it's the second largest laundry in st louis .
i wouldn't wanna kid you .
i ain't cut out for business .
well , will you think of me?
oh , gay ...
oh , you know i will , honey .
goodbye .
bye .
how're you doin ', boy?
ready to cut out of this town?
cos i am .
well , i've been thinkin 'about it .
which one was that?
susan .
swell sport , that woman .
i just met me a girl sweet enough to eat , gay .
fine lookin 'woman .
but when i think of all the useless talkin 'you gotta do , i get discouraged .
i tell you , i'm dyin 'for some fresh air .
and no people , male or female .
why don't we take out to the mountains?
we could even do a little mustangin '.
i wanted to pile up about 500 this time .
i need a new engine .
that engine'll fly you anywhere .
say , you've been two months on this job .
you'll get the habit .
i'll see you over at harrah's later .
let's talk about it .
tom dooley .
lf you throw in your ring you'll never get another divorce .
go ahead , honey .
everybody does it .
more gold in that river than there is in the klondike .
did you do that?
who , me?
no .
i lost my ring on my honeymoon .
let's get a drink .
that's my girl .
wait a minute , honey .
this machine loves me .
never say die .
scotch , i guess , on i ...
yeah , on ice .
rye and water .
scotch on ice , rye and water .
well , cheer up .
i will .
i just hate to fight with anybody .
when you win , you lose .
you know , in your heart .
well , you're free .
maybe the trouble is you're not used to it yet .
no , the trouble is i always end up back where i started .
never had anybody much .
and here i am .
well , you had your mother , didn't you?
how do you have somebody who disappears all the time?
they both weren't there .
she'd go off with a patient for three months and ...
you know how long three months is to a kid .
listen , don't leave .
settle here .
they got a school .
you could teach dancing .
one thing about this town , it's always full of interesting strangers .
oh , i'm sorry .
what did i say?
i ...
i suddenly miss my mother .
oh , isn't that the stupidest thing?
lz , you're a fine woman .
practically the only woman that's ever been my friend .
well , drink up then .
oh , isn't that the dearest dog?
look how sweet he sits there .
yeah .
dogs are nice .
here .
puppy .
hey , dooley .
hello .
how'd you make out?
ok .
i'd like you to meet a friend of mine .
gay ...
gay langland , mrs taber .
howdy do?
and this is mrs , uh ...?
steers . lsabelle steers .
one thing about reno men , they do remember the name .
why don't you boys sit down?
thank you .
what're you girls drinkin '?
whiskey .
we're celebratin 'the jail burned down .
mary , see if you can get four doubles , will you?
uh ... you sure made a big impression on my friend here .
and i can see why .
you a mechanic too?
him?
he's a cowboy .
how'd you know?
i can smell , can't l?
hey , you can't smell cows on me .
i smell the look on your face , cowboy .
but i love every miserable one of ya .
course , you're all good for nothin ', as you know .
that may be .
but it's better than wages .
i suppose you'll be headin 'back east soon , mrs taber?
i can't make up my mind .
i don't know yet what to do .
you don't have a business to run , or a school to teach , or ...?
me?
i never finished high school .
well !
that's real good news .
you don't like educated women?
they're all right .
always wantin 'to know what you're thinkin ', that's all .
maybe they want to get to know you .
did you ever get to know a man better by askin 'him questions?
you mean he'd lie?
well , he might not .
and then again , he just might .
how about it , pilot?
we takin 'off today?
you ever been outside reno , mrs taber?
i walked to the edge of town .
doesn't look like much is out there .
everything's there .
like what?
the country .
well , what do you do with yourself?
just live .
how do you just live?
well , you start by goin 'to sleep .
you get up when you feel like it .
you scratch yourself .
you fry some eggs .
you see what kind of a day it is .
you throw stones at a can and whistle .
i know what you mean .
i have an empty house in the country just beyond hawleyville .
it's all yours if you want some peace and quiet before you go back .
the last woman's gone?
no kiddin '.
i never offered it before .
well , i wouldn't stay there .
but let's rent a car .
we could look at the country .
gay has a truck .
you can have my car .
then you'll have to drive me back .
i don't mind .
thanks , but i like to feel i'm on my own .
i'll rent a car .
where can l?
right now?
why not?
ok .
you sure don't waste time , do you?
i just gotta stop by the garage and quit .
hey , now , that's the boy .
no , gay .
this is mine .
mm .
what is that beautiful smell?
smells like green perfume .
that's sage , darlin '.
oh , sure !
i never smelled it except in bottles .
gee , it's beautiful here .
look , dear girl , i think i better tell you somethin 'about cowboys .
you really worry about me , don't you?
well , you're too believin '.
cowboys are the last real men left , ... .. and they're about as reliable as jack rabbits .
ls anybody any different?
maybe you're not supposed to believe people .
maybe it's not even fair to them .
i couldn't hear what he said to her , but it looked like she left him .
the husband .
she's kinda hard to figure out , you know?
one minute she looks kinda dumb and brand new , like a kid , ... .. and the next minute ...
she sure moves , though , don't she?
mm .
she's real prime .
it isn't finished yet .
it's weathertight .
come on in .
it's insulated .
flush doors .
this is the living room .
and this was gonna be another bedroom .
it's even nicer this way .
here's a picture window .
take a look at this view .
take a look at that .
gee .
it goes on for ever .
fireplace .
brick .
this is the kitchen .
gas refrigerator .
it's nice .
and here's the bathroom .
ceramic tile .
here's our ...
this was our bedroom .
my wife .
she died here .
i'm ... sorry .
she was due to have a baby .
i was up setting the capstone on the chimney ... .. and she screamed ... .. and that was that .
couldn't you call a doctor?
she didn't seem to be that sick .
then i got a flat .
i didn't have a spare .
everything just happened wrong .
it'll do that sometimes .
yeah , i know .
uh , you couldn't live here any more , huh?
we knew each other since we were seven years old , see?
you ought to find yourself another girl .
i don't know .
me with anybody else , it seems impossible , you know?
she wasn't like any other women .
stood behind me 100 per cent , uncomplaining as a tree .
maybe that's what killed her .
i mean , a little complaining helps sometimes maybe .
hey , lz , isn't this a beautiful place here?
yeah .
it'd be just perfect if somebody'd bring in that bottle of whiskey i bought .
with my own money .
hey , that's right !
and bring that bag of groceries .
maybe somebody wants a sandwich .
the glasses are in the kitchen , lsabelle .
i'm real tired .
no , you're just a cowboy , darlin '.
you fellas won't move unless it's rainin 'down your necks .
too rough for you , roslyn?
i don't mind that .
you should've seen his wife .
she helped pour cement and knocked in nails .
she was a real good sport .
now she's dead because he didn't have a spare tyre .
well , that's the way it goes .
it goes the other way too , though .
don't forget that .
it's sure nice to see people in here .
come on , let's have a drink .
i'll start the fridge .
it makes ice quick .
lce?
we gonna stay that long , roslyn?
i don't know .
oh , sure .
come on .
there's no better place to be .
and you couldn't find better company , either .
all right .
that's it , sport .
turn on that ice , guido .
let's get this stuff a flowin ', make the desert bloom .
well , flow it slow .
we only got one bottle .
there .
put that in your thoughts and see how they come out .
come on , sit down , everybody .
let's get comfortable .
i'm sure glad you like this place .
here's to nevada , the " leave it " state .
the what state?
the " leave it " state .
you got money to gamble , leave it here .
a wife you wanna get rid of , get rid of her here .
extra atom bomb you don't need , blow it up here .
nobody will mind in the slightest .
the slogan of nevada is " anything goes , but don't complain if it went .
that's no lie .
i even left my southern accent here .
how come you never went back home?
you came here for a divorce , didn't you?
i wasn't beautiful enough to go back .
oh , lsabelle .
no , that's true .
beauty's a help any place , but in virginia it's a necessity .
why , you can't hardly get a driver's licence without it .
no , i love nevada .
you know , they don't even have regular meal times here .
never met so many people didn't own a watch .
might have two wives at the same time , but no watch .
bless them all .
how quiet it is here .
sweetest sound there is .
there's an lndian store about five miles , if you wanna shop .
groceries , everything .
lf you wanna stay , that is .
be glad to come by and do your chores , if you like .
you know , he reminds me of that cowboy friend i told you about .
had one arm gone , but he was more man with one arm ... .. than any other man is with two .
oh?
i mean like cookin '.
oh !
no , i'm serious .
he could take a panful of chops , toss 'em , ... .. and they all came down on the other side .
who is he?
maybe they know him .
darlin ', you can't go lookin 'for a man .
what , did he take off?
no , not exactly .
he just never came back .
andy powell .
you ever ...?
sure !
called andy gump sometimes?
that's him .
you know where he is?
saw him at the rodeo only last month .
maybe we could find him .
stop thinkin 'you can change things .
but if there's something you can do ...
i don't know what to do , but if i knew , i'd do it .
have you got a radio or a phonograph?
maybe we'll have some music .
there's no electricity .
the car radio .
now who'd have thought of that?
you always get an idea , don't you?
i'll go bring the car round .
say , how about another drink to keep that first one warm?
i'd love it .
i'm gonna make myself a sandwich .
how about you folks?
ok .
i hope you're gonna stay on here .
any chance?
why?
what difference would it make?
might make all the difference in the world as time goes by .
like to dance?
ok .
thanks . lz , give him another drink .
it's a wonderful house , guido .
hey , that's pretty good dancin ', cowboy .
what are you doin '?
she used to teach dancin '.
you know?
before she was married .
no kiddin '? ln a dance hall?
uh huh .
how about the landlord?
move over , boy , huh?
watch out for those pretty little feet .
she knows how to get out of the way .
let's go .
where'd you learn that , pilot?
i never knew him to dance at all .
look at old pilot comin 'out from under a bushel !
hey , you two ought to put on a show !
come on , honey .
this is a good one .
i haven't danced like this in years .
didn't your wife dance?
not like you .
she had no gracefulness .
why didn't you teach her to be graceful?
you can't learn that .
how do you know?
i mean , how do you know?
you see , she died , and she didn't know how you can dance .
to a certain extent , maybe you were strangers .
i don't feel like discussing my wife .
don't be mad .
i only meant that if you loved her you could've taught her anything .
because ... we're all dying , aren't we?
all the husbands and all the wives .
every minute .
and we're not teaching each other what we really know , are we?
dum da da ... dum ...
guido , you're a nice man .
smile .
come on .
come on , lz .
i'm lookin 'for your shoes , dear girl .
watch out .
there's no step !
we better get you home , girl .
you were worried about me .
how sweet .
just wanna keep you all in one pretty piece .
would you have had a spare tyre?
somebody'd better drive her .
go ahead .
i'll take the truck .
oh , lz , don't leave poor guido alone .
tom dooley !
you're a real beautiful woman .
it's almost kind of an honour sittin 'next to you .
you just shine in my eyes .
that's my true feelin ', roslyn .
what makes you so sad?
i think you're the saddest girl i ever met .
you're the first man that ever said that .
i'm usually told how happy i am .
that's because you make a man feel happy .
i don't feel that way about you , gay .
well , don't get discouraged , girl .
you might .
look , why don't you try it out here for a while , see what happens?
you know , sometimes when a person don't know what to do , ... .. the best thing is to just stand still .
i'll guarantee you'll have something out here you wouldn't find on every corner .
i , uh ...
i may not amount to much in some ways , but i am a good friend .
thanks .
let me take you back and get your things .
try it for a while , see what happens .
ever hear the story about the city man out in the country?
he sees this fella sittin 'on his porch , so he says " mister , ... .. could you tell me how i can get back to town? " the fella says " no .
well , could you tell me how to get to the post office? " the fella says " no .
well , do you know how to get to the railroad station? " " no .
boy , " he says , " you sure don't know much , do you?
the fella says " nope .
but i ain't lost .
don't you have a home?
sure .
never was a better one , either .
where is it?
right here .
come on .
i got a surprise for you .
you cooked breakfast .
here , let me .
no , no , no .
you sit down and enjoy yourself .
just this once .
you do this often?
uh uh .
first time for me .
really and truly?
mm hm .
mm .
smells delicious .
hey , you really go all out , don't you?
even the way you eat .
i like that .
women generally pick .
you like me , huh?
birds must be brave to live out here .
at night especially .
whereas they're so small , you know?
mm hm .
you think i'm crazy .
i look that way cos i can't make you out .
why?
i don't know .
you got children?
i never wanted children with him .
oh .
children are supposed to bring you together .
but what if they don't?
i've known of so called happily married couples .
one time , the wife was in the hospital to have the baby ... .. and the husband was calling me up .
i mean , he was calling me .
they're still supposed to be happily married .
i guess you believe in true love , don't you?
i don't know , but they ought to invent a way that you don't have children ... .. unless you care for each other , cos kids know the difference .
i always knew the difference .
listen , if you wanna go somewhere , i don't mind being alone .
do i look like i wanna leave?
i just want you to do what you feel like .
you ain't kiddin '.
even when you're kiddin ', you ain't kiddin '.
no .
it makes me feel peaceful .
you know , they come out here from new york , chicago , st louis , ... .. and find them a cowboy .
cowboys are supposed to be dumb , you know .
so they tell 'em everything .
and they do everything .
everything they couldn't do back home .
it's pitiful .
why is it pitiful?
cowboy's laughin 'at 'em , and they don't even know it .
it's nice to meet someone who has respect for a man .
did you ever think of getting married again?
yeah .
i've thought about it a lot of times .
but never in daylight .
you get lonesome for your children?
oh , i see 'em now and then .
they come whenever i'm in a rodeo .
i'm a pretty good roper .
i get lonesome , sure .
my daughter is almost your size .
uh ...
you size 1 2?
uh huh .
yeah .
so is she .
i bought her a dress for christmas .
size 1 2 .
what happened?
did you just stop loving your wife , gay?
well , i come home one night and she's all wrapped up in a car with a fella .
turned out to be an old friend .
a cousin of mine , as a matter of fact .
oh .
you never had any idea , huh?
no .
you know , in those days i thought you got married and that was it .
but nothin 'is it .
not for ever .
that's what i can't get used to .
everything keeps changing .
i'll tell you this , though .
i wouldn't know how to say goodbye to you , roslyn .
it surprises me .
there's a lot to be done around this place .
lf we were gonna stay awhile .
let's go out in the sunshine .
come on .
let's just live like you said in the bar .
i don't know where i am yet .
hey !
couldn't we use that for a step?
well , we just might at that .
there you are .
let me try it .
it's perfect .
i can go in ... and i can come out .
go in ... and i can come out .
go in ... .. and i can come out .
i can go in ... .. and i can come out .
guido !
what's he doing?
might land .
there's a place back there .
nah .
i guess he's just sayin 'hello .
here , have some lemonade .
oh , thanks .
what does he do?
just fly around?
could be goin 'for eagles .
now and again ranchers hire guido to shoot eagles .
why?
well , they kill a lot of lambs .
he gets $50 a bird .
i never really saw anything grow before .
how tiny those seeds were .
and yet they know they're supposed to be lettuces .
you say the darnedest things .
you know that , don't you?
everybody's busy in chicago , and here we are .
i love this whole state !
hey ...
what have we here now?
well ...
just plain old rabbit !
i'm gonna get him .
it's just one lettuce .
maybe he won't do it any more .
no , ma'am !
it's them or us !
there won't be a thing left inside of a week .
couldn't you wait and see?
i can't stand to see anything killed .
honey , it's only a rabbit .
but it doesn't know any better , does it?
go on inside and let me handle this .
i know you worked hard ...
you're darn right !
and i didn't do it for some bug eyed rabbit .
gay , please .
honey , will you go on inside now?
and stop bein 'silly?
i'm not being silly .
you don't respect what i feel .
and i don't care about the lettuce !
i care about it !
and how about havin 'some respect for me?
oh , guido and lsabelle !
guido !
dear girl !
i thought i saw a passenger !
we never heard you land .
my , you look thrivin '.
boy , am i in the right place?
seen the vegetable garden?
took gay a week just to turn the soil .
mowed the grass and put in them flowers too .
i got your windows unstuck .
fireplace don't smoke now .
you must be a magician .
all he ever did for a woman was get out the ice cubes .
look , we have chairs .
come and sit .
let's show him the inside .
you know , i've moved this furniture so many times , i'm gettin 'long ears !
my , you look lovely .
you've really found yourself , haven't you?
well , i ...
oh , it's so nice to see you , lsabelle .
look , we have a step .
how's your arm?
well , it's still as weak as a bird's wing .
well , i never saw anything like it in my life .
it's magical .
just hope you realise you finally made contact with a real woman .
my dear girl !
come , guido .
i wanna show you the rest .
i've changed a few things , though .
we've changed things around .
how do you like it?
oh , don't look at those .
gay just hung 'em up for a joke .
i put your picture up in the living room .
come on , let's have lots of drinks .
come on .
oh , it's so nice to have company .
i put your picture there . ls that all right?
you don't have to keep it out .
why , guido , it's part of the house .
besides , it's your house .
oh , sit in the big chair .
this must've been your chair .
matter of fact , it was .
lsabelle .
put this under your arm .
thanks , dear girl .
i used to do all my studyin 'in this chair .
when i was still ambitious .
what did you study?
i was on my way to bein 'a doctor .
before the war .
well , you never can tell .
maybe you'll get ambitious again .
i'm gonna tell you somethin ', roslyn .
i spent four years in the war .
did two tours , flew 50 missions .
every time i came back to base i started to design this house .
but somehow i could never get it to look like my idea of it .
now it almost does .
you just walk in , a stranger out of nowhere , ... .. and for the first time it all lights up .
and i'm sure you know why too .
why?
because you have the gift for life .
the rest of us , we're just lookin 'for a place to hide and watch it all go by .
amen .
here's to your life , roslyn .
i hope it goes on for ever .
and yours .
and yours , lsabelle .
and gay .
gay did all the work , you know .
yeah .
and the rabbits are sure enjoyin 'it too .
can you break away from this paradise long enough to do a little mustangin '?
mustangin '?
now you're sayin 'somethin '.
you been up in the mountains?
took a quick look earlier this mornin '.
i spotted 1 5 horses .
that's not too bad .
boy , i'd sure like to get my hands on a rope again .
what do you say?
i will never understand cowboys .
all crazy about animals , and the minute they got nothin 'else to do , ... .. they run up in the mountains and bother those poor wild horses .
shame on you !
horses?
sure .
nevada mustang .
used to ship 'em all over the united states .
not many left .
we'd have to pick up another man .
dayton rodeo's on today .
we ought to be able to pick up a fella there .
that's an idea .
hey , you never saw a rodeo .
oh , you gotta see a rodeo !
i'd love to .
will you come too?
i'm all set .
i'll get dressed up .
let's have some fun !
that's a girl .
go right now .
honey , when you smile it's like the sun comin 'up .
boy , i'd like to have stopped off home and get cleaned up .
why?

i spotted 1 5 this morning .
there might be a lot more , though .
well , i don't know .
what do you expect to get out of it?
of 1 5 horses?
i mean , like , if there was a thousand or more ...
but goin 'all the way up there for 1 5 , it kinda hits me sideways .
better than wages , ain't it?
oh , anything's better than wages .
i tell you what .
we'll drive you to the rodeo , put up the ten for the entrance .
you come along tomorrow and help us run some mustang .

you're just a natural born fool .
it's wonderful to be that way .
