yeah , ok .
blonde's fine .
well , that's what they say .
the discount inn .
304 .
leonard .
well , what then?
we just go to bed .
you wait for me to fall asleep .
you go into the bathroom and slam the door .
slam it?
yeah .
loud enough to wake me up .
and that's it?
that's it .
ah ...
yeah , first i just need you to put these things around the room .
pretend they're your things and this is your bedroom .
should i wear it?
no , no , no .
uh , just like you took it off .
i don't want you to use it .
i'm sorry .
i just mean put them around the room , as if they were your ... your things .
whatever gets you off .
i can't blame the cops for not taking me seriously .
this is a difficult condition to understand .
look at sammy jankis .
his own wife couldn't deal with it .
i told you how she tried to get him to snap out of it .
she came to see me at the office .
i found out all kinds of shit .
she told me about life with sammy .
how she treated him .
thank you for seeing me .
she'd get sammy to hide food around the house ... ... then she'd stop feeding him to see if his hunger would make him remember .
i've taken him to a parking lot and , uh ... she wasn't a cruel person .
she just wanted her old sammy back .
you know all about sammy and you've decided he's faking .
the company's position isn't that sammy's faking anything ... ... just that his condition can't be shown to be ...
i just want to know your honest opinion about sammy .
we shouldn't be talking like this while the case is still open to appeal .
i'm not appealing the decision .
then why are you here?
try to understand , when i look at sammy , i don't see some ... vegetable .
i see my same old sammy .
what do you think that's like for me ... ... to suspect that he might be imagining this whole problem?
that if i just could say the right thing ... ... he'd snap out of it and go back to being normal .
if i ...
if i knew that my old sammy were truly gone ... ... then i could say goodbye and start loving this new sammy .
as long as i have doubt i can't say goodbye and move on .
what do you want from me?
i want you to forget the company you work for for thirty seconds ... ... and tell me if you really believe that sammy's faking his condition .
i need to know ... ... what you honestly believe .
i believe that sammy should be physically capable of making new memories .
thank you .
i thought i'd helped her .
i thought she just needed an answer .
i didn't think it was important what it was .
just that she had one to believe .
a car this nice you should lock .
who the fuck are you?
teddy , your buddy .
prove it !
remember sammy?
you told me about sammy !
jeez !
what the fuck are you doing in my car?
what , your sense of humour went with the memory?
do you know why you're here?
unfinished business .
lenny ... ... let me inform you , your business here is very much finished .
you're still here because of natalie .
who's natalie?
schmuck !
whose house do you think you just walked out of?
that's right , take a look at your pictures .
i bet you got one of her .
oh , nice shot , leibovitz
you'll want to make a note .
you can't trust her .
why's that?
because by now she's taken a look at the suit and the car ... ... and she's figuring out ways of turning the situation to her advantage .
she's already got you staying with her , for christ sakes .
you can't go back there .
let me give you the name of a motel .
you're lucky i ran into you .
that broad's bad news .
what do you mean , " bad news "?
she's involved with drugs .
look .
see these?
this is the bar where she works .
her boyfriend's a drug dealer .
she takes orders for him , arranges meets .
he writes messages on the back of these ... ... then she slips him the answers when she serves him his drinks .
why should i care?
because when she gets jammed up ... ... she's gonna use you to protect herself .
from who?
guys are gonna wanna know what happened to her boyfriend .
guys are gonna come after her .
somebody's got to pay , lenny .
somebody always pays .
maybe she'll make it you .
oh , yeah?
well , maybe she'll make it you .
is that it?
you worried that she's gonna use me against you?
no .
why not?
because she doesn't know who i am .
why are you following me?
maybe i wanna help .
she doesn't know anything about your investigation .
ok , einstein?
so write this down .
when she offers to help , it'll be for her own reasons .
i'm not lying .
take my pen , write this down .
do not trust her .
there .
you happy now?
i won't be happy until you leave town .
why not?
you ever wonder how long you can hang around here ... ... before people start asking questions?
what sort of questions?
the same questions you should be asking yourself .
like what?
like how did you get this suit , the car?
i have money .
from what?
my wife's death .
i used to work in insurance .
we were well covered .
oh !
so in your grief you wandered into a jaguar dealership?
you don't have a clue , do you?
you don't even know who you are .
yes , i do .
i don't have amnesia .
i remember everything right up until the incident .
i am leonard shelby , i am from san francisco ...
that's who you were .
you do not know who you are .
what you've become since ... ... the incident .
you wander around playing detective .
you don't even know how long ago it was .
let me put it this way .
were you wearing designer suits when you sold insurance?
i didn't sell insurance , i investigated it .
right , right .
you're an investigator .
maybe you should investigate yourself .
oh , thank you for the advice .
look , do me a favour , don't go back in there .
will you take the motel out of town?
it's been fun , lenny .
do not trust her .
don't believe his lies .
oh , fuck it .
i need my own place .
no .
she shouldn't have given me that responsibility .
i'm a claims investigator , not a doctor .
yeah , yeah , i guess .
i've got all sorts of other considerations .
legal responsibility , large financ ...
who is this?
write this down .
write down what happened .
write it down .
come on , concentrate .
keep it in mind .
find a p ...
what happened?
he beat the shit out of me .
who?
who?
fuck , leonard , dodd !
dodd beat the shit out of me .
why?
because of you !
because i did what you told me to do , reason with him ... ... tell him about teddy .
great idea !
calm down .
calm down , take it easy .
you're safe .
it's ok .
come on .
just sit down .
sit down .
here , sit down .
ok .
you're ok .
i'll just get some ice for your face .
here .
i did exactly what you told me to do .
i went to dodd ... ... and i told him that i didn't have any of jimmy's money ... ... or the drugs .
and that this teddy must have taken everything .
and what did he say?
he didn't believe me .
he said if i don't have the drugs by tomorrow , he's gonna kill me .
and then he just ... he just started hitting me .
where is he?
why?
i'll go see him .
i'll give him some bruises of his own and tell him to look for a guy called teddy .
oh , he'll kill you , lenny .
my wife used to call me lenny .
yeah?
yeah , i hated it .
oh , this guy is so dangerous .
let's just think of something else , ok?
no , no , no .
you just tell me what he looks like .
and where i can find him .
have you got a pen?
in my purse .
he'll , um ... he'll probably find you .
what do you mean?
i told him about your car .
why?
he was beating the shit out of me , i had to tell him something .
just write it all down .
be careful .
i'll be fine .
a car this nice you should lock .
who the fuck are you?
front desk?
burt , right .
this is mr shelby in room 21 .
yeah , that's it , i don't want any calls .
no , none at all .
what's wrong?
somebody's come already .
who?
calls himself dodd .
what does he want?
wants to know what happened to jimmy and his money .
he thinks i took it .
did you?
no .
what's this all about?
you don't have a fucking clue , do you?
you're just blissfully ignorant , aren't you?
look , i have this condition .
i know all about your fucking condition !
i probably know more about it than you , you don't have a clue about anything else .
what happened?
jimmy went to meet a guy named teddy .
he took a lot of money with him and never came back .
jimmy's partners think i set him up .
i don't know if you know this teddy .
neither do i.
don't protect him !
help me .
how?
get rid of dodd for me .
what?
kill him .
i'll pay you .
what do you think i am?
i'm not gonna kill someone for money .
what , then?
love?
what would you kill for?
you'd kill for your wife , wouldn't you?
that's different .
not to me , i wasn't married to her !
hey , don't talk about my wife .
i can talk about whoever the fuck i want !
i can say whatever i want and you won't remember !
i can call your wife a fucking whore and we can still be friends .
calm down .
you can't get scared !
you don't know how , you fucking idiot !
this has nothing to do with me .
how the fuck would you know?
you don't know a fucking thing !
hey , can you get angry?
yes .
you pathetic piece of shit !
i can say whatever the fuck i want and you won't have a clue , you fucking retard !
i'm gonna use you .
i'm telling you now because i'm gonna enjoy it much more ... ... if i know that you could stop me if you weren't such a fucking freak .
did you lose your pen?
too bad , freak .
otherwise you could write yourself a note about how much natalie hates your guts ... ... and that i called your wife a whore !
don't say another fucking word !
about your whore of a wife?
i read about your condition , leonard .
you know one of the causes of short term memory loss?
venereal disease .
maybe your cunt of a fucking wife ... ... sucked one too many diseased cocks and turned you into a retard !
you sad , sad freak .
i can say whatever the fuck i want and you won't remember .
we'll still be best friends .
or maybe even lovers .
fuck !
i'll see you soon .
stay focused .
find a pen .
i'm gonna write this down .
i'm gonna write it down .
concentrate , concentrate , concentrate .

what happened?
what does it look like?
he beat the shit out of me .
who?
who?
fuck , leonard , dodd !
dodd beat the shit out of me .
hello?
it's burt , from the front desk .
yeah?
i know you said you didn't want any calls but this guy on the phone says he's a cop .
a cop?
yeah .
he says you're really gonna wanna know what he has to say .
i'm not too good on the phone .
i need to look people in the eye .
well , what ...
you can , um , you can crash on the couch .
it's comfortable .
just have a seat .
thanks .
so , how long do you think it's gonna take you?
hm?
you told me you were looking for the guy who killed your wife .
oh , it depends on if he's here in town or if he's moved on .
i have my file here .
can i ask you something?
if you have all that information , why haven't the police found him for you?
they're not looking for him .
why not?
they don't think he exists .
you see , i told them what i remembered .
i was asleep .
something woke me up .
her side of the bed was cold .
she'd obviously been gone for a while .
there had to be a second man .
somebody hit me from behind .
i remember .
it's the last thing i do remember .
look , the police didn't believe me .
if we check ...
how did they explain what you do remember?
the gun and stuff?
john g was clever .
he was clever .
he took the dead man's gun and replaced it with the sap he hit me with .
he left my gun and the getaway car .
he gave the police a complete package .
they found the sap with my blood on it in the dead man's hand .
and they only found my gun .
they didn't need to look for anybody else .
i was the only guy who disagreed with the facts and i had brain damage .
the cops are not gonna believe someone in my condition .
leonard .
you can stay here for a couple of days if it will help you .
oh , thanks .
i have to go back to work , so , um , just make yourself at home .
you can watch tv or have some food .
whatever you want , ok?
make yourself at home .
one thing .
something to remember you by .
my name is natalie .
natalie .
what's wrong?
somebody's come already .
on the house .
thanks .
my , you really do have a problem .
just like that cop said .
hm?
your condition .
well , nobody's perfect .
what's the last thing that you " do " remember?
my wife .
that's sweet .
dying .
i remember my wife dying .
let me , um , get you another one .
i think this one's dusty .
why are you calling me?
what do you want?
i know you're a cop .
what do you want?
have i done something wrong?
i don't know , something bad , maybe .
look , why are you asking me?
i can't remember what i've done .
you wouldn't believe me anyway .
because of my condition , you don't believe someone with this condition .
nobody believed sammy !
i didn't even fucking believe sammy !
ferdy's bar .
come by after .
natalie .
a beer , please .
what do you want?
a beer , please .
you can't just waltz in here dressed like that and ask for a beer .
what , is there a dress code?
why are you here?
i'm meeting someone called natalie .
well , that's me .
yeah , we met before , right?
then why am i here?
i don't know , why don't you tell me?
i don't remember .
i have no short term memory .
oh , you're that memory guy .
how do you know about me?
my boyfriend told me about you .
oh , yeah?
who's your boyfriend?
jimmy grants .
do you know him?
no .
he knows you .
he told me about you .
he said you were staying at the discount .
in fact , a cop came by earlier and was looking for you .
said he was looking for a guy who can't remember anything ... ... wouldn't know how he'd got here or what he'd done .
i get a lot of guys round here like that .
chronic alcoholism is one cause of short term memory loss .
are you teddy?
no , my name's leonard .
did teddy send you?
i don't know .
what's happened to jimmy?
i don't know that , either .
sorry .
you don't remember anything?
you don't remember where you've been or what you've just done?
i can't make new memories .
everything just fades .
then why did you come here?
i found this in my pocket .
your pocket?
bar bet .
care to contribute?
no , thanks .
it's for a lot of money .
come on .
proceeds are going to charity .
help me out .
thank you .
on the house .
thanks .
it's completely fucked because nobody believes you .
it's amazing what a little brain damage will do for your credibility .
i guess it's poetic justice for not believing sammy .
you know the truth about my condition , officer?
you don't know anything .
you feel angry , you don't know why .
you feel guilty , you have no idea why .
you could do anything and not have the faintest idea ten minutes later .
like sammy .
what if i'd done something like sammy?
i didn't tell you?
what happened to sammy and his wife?
she came to see me at my office .
i didn't tell her what i really thought but i never said that he was faking .
just that his condition was mental , not physical .
i found out later that she went home and gave sammy his final exam .
sammy?
it's time for my shot .
she knew beyond a doubt that he loved her , so she found a way to test him .
sammy?
it's time for my shot .
hm .
she really thought she'd call his bluff .
there you go .
or she just didn't want to live with the things she'd put him through .
sammy?
it's time for my shot .
it won't hurt .
she went into a coma and never recovered .
sammy couldn't understand or explain what happened .
oh !
he's been in a home ever since .
he doesn't even know his wife is dead .
i was wrong about sammy and i was wrong about his wife .
she wasn't interested in the money .
she needed to understand his problem .
his brain didn't respond to conditioning but he wasn't a con man .
and when she looked into his eyes , she thought he could be the same person .
when i looked into his eyes , i thought i saw recognition .
now i know you fake it .
if you think you're supposed to recognise somebody , you pretend to .
you bluff it to get a pat on the head from the doctors .
you bluff it to seem less of a freak .
what drug dealer?
hey , lenny , how you doing?
it's private back here .
it's ok , we know each other .
right , kid?
how did you know i was in here?
the jag's out front .
what are you still doing here , lenny?
there's plenty of tattoo parlours up north .
i guess i wanted to get something down before it slipped my mind .
give me the keys , i'll move it .
it'll be all right .
wait out there .
oh , for christ ...
give me a minute , i've got to get something for you .
fact six .
car licence sg13 7iu .
look , wait a minute , will ya?
we gotta get you out of here .
why?
oh , man .
come on , leonard .
how many times i gotta tell you?
it's not safe for you to hang around .
why not?
because that cop's looking for you .
i gotta get you a new identity ... ... some new clothes , a different car would do for now .
put these on .
whoa , whoa .
what cop?
he's a bad cop .
he's the one that checked you into the discount inn .
he's been calling you for days , slipping envelopes under your door , shit like that .
how do you know this?
he told me .
he's been laughing at you .
you're full of shit .
no , i'm not .
he knows you're no good on the phone so he's been calling you up .
sometimes you don't answer the phone ... ... so he slips shit under your door to scare you into answering it ... ... giving you a line of crap about john g being a local drug dealer .
jimmy grants .
who's jimmy grants?
leonard , jimmy's the drug dealer .
the cop wants to know how his operation is run .
he's got some score in mind .
somehow you're involved .
how do you know him?
i'm a snitch .
he's a cop from out of town .
the local boys put us together .
if he knew i was helping you , he'd fucking kill me .
so take these clothes , put them on and get the fuck out of here .
come on , leonard , just go .
you " are " full of shit .
come by after .
natalie .
ferdy's bar .
hey , jimmy .
i'm sorry , i , uh , thought you were somebody else .
sorry .
that's ok .
this jimmy grants deals drugs out of the bar where his girlfriend works?
but he's not going to bring her along?
he'll come by himself , right?
i always figured the drugs angle would be the best way to get him .
no , officer .
i'm as ready as i'll ever be .
you're in the lobby?
what do you look like?
i'll be right there .
lenny !
officer gammell?
yeah .
come on .
hey , smile .
oh , don't , uh ...
not here .
over here .
is it officer or lieutenant gammell?
you know what?
don't write gammell , just teddy .
why?
i'm undercover .
this is the directions , where he's going .
my number's on the bottom if you ...
you're not coming?
nah , it wouldn't be appropriate .
nice picture .
i look thin .
hey , lenny !
make him beg .
teddy !
hey , teddy !

yeah , i remember you .
where the fuck's teddy?
well?
motherfuck !
what are you doing?
strip .
you're making a big fucking mistake !
strip !
my associates are not the kind of people you wanna piss off .
don't say anything else .
i knew i couldn't trust that fuck !
take it off .
your pants , too .
why?
i don't wanna get blood on them .
whoa , whoa , whoa !
wait , wait , wait !
did he tell you what i was bringing?
take your fuckin 'pants off !
i've got two hundred grand in the car !
just take it !
you think you can bargain with me?
just take the money and walk away .
i don't want your fucking money .
then , what?
what do you want from me?
i want my fucking life back !
sammy .
he said sammy .
how does he know about sammy?
oh , fuck .
what have i done?
hey , mister !
i need help !
there's a guy in here , he's hurt bad .
we gotta get him to a doctor .
all right .
i don't know what happened .
i've got this memory thing .
do i know you?
no .
don't worry , i'm a cop .
is he still breathing?
well , i don't know .
maybe .
what the hell were you guys doing?
i don't remember , i have this condition .
i hope it's not as serious as his cos this guy's dead .
ow !
lenny !
that shit kills !
so you remember me now , huh?
you " are " a fucking cop !
and i'm the guy that helped you find him .
get up !
get up !
lenny , you got the wrong idea !
who is that?
he knew me .
of course he did , he raped your wife , he fucked up your brain .
bullshit !
he's not the guy .
his name is james f grants .
john g. check your tattoos .
why did he bring two hundred grand?
what?
what was it for?
amphetamines i told him i had .
is this a drug deal?
no .
yeah , that and your thing .
look , jimmy's your guy .
i figured we'd make a few dollars on the side .
how did he know me?
the discount inn .
he dealt out of there .
the guy at the front desk let him know if anybody came round .
he called jimmy the minute he saw you taking a picture .
you're fucking using me .
no !
you get half .
he knew about sammy , why would i tell him about sammy? !
you tell everybody about sammy !
everybody who'll listen !
remember sammy jankis?
remember sammy jankis?
great story .
gets better every time you tell it .
so you lie to yourself to be happy .
there's nothing wrong with that .
we all do it .
who cares if there's a few little details you'd rather not remember?
what the fuck are you talking about?
i don't know .
your wife surviving the assault .
her not believing your condition .
the torment and pain and anguish tearing her up inside .
the insulin .
that's sammy , not me .
i told you about sammy .
yeah , right .
like you tell yourself over and over again .
condtitioning yourself to remember , learning through repetition .
sammy let his wife kill herself .
sammy ended up in an institution .
sammy was a con man .
a faker .
i never said that sammy was faking .
you exposed him for what he was .
a fraud .
i was wrong .
that's the whole point .
see , sammy's wife came to me ...
sammy didn't have a wife .
it was your wife who had diabetes .
ouch !
my wife wasn't diabetic .
you sure?
ouch !
cut it out !
she wasn't diabetic .
you think i don't know my own wife?
what the fuck is wrong with you?
i guess i can only make you remember the things you want to be true .
like old jimmy down there .
he's not the right guy .
he was to you .
come on , you got your revenge .
enjoy it while you still remember .
what difference does it make whether he was your guy or not?
it makes all the difference .
why?
you're never gonna know .
yes , i will .
no , you won't .
somehow i'll know .
you won't remember !
when it's done , i will know .
i thought so , too , i was sure of it , but you didn't !
that's right .
the real john g. i helped you find him over a year ago .
he's already dead .
don't lie to me any more .
look , lenny ... ... i was the cop assigned to your wife's case , i believed you .
i thought you deserved a chance for revenge .
i'm the one that helped you find the other guy in your bathroom that night .
the guy that cracked your skull and fucked your wife .
we found him , you killed him .
but you didn't remember .
so i helped you start looking again , looking for the guy you already killed .
oh , yeah?
so who was he?
just some guy .
does it matter who?
no reason , lenny , no conspiracy , just bad fucking luck .
couple of junkies too strung out to realise your wife didn't live alone .
but when you killed him i was so convinced that you'd remember .
but it didn't stick .
like nothing ever sticks , like this won't stick .
i took that picture .
just when you did it .
look how happy you are .
i wanted to see that face again .
oh , gee , thanks
fuck you .
i gave you a reason to live and you were more than happy to help .
you don't want the truth .
you make up your own truth , like your police file .
it was complete when i gave it to you .
who took out the twelve pages?
you , probably .
no , it wasn't me , see , it was you .
why would i do that?
to create a puzzle you could never solve .
do you know how many towns ... ... how many john gs or james gs?
i mean , shit , lenny , i'm a fucking john g.
your name's teddy .
my mother calls me teddy .
my name's john edward gammell .
cheer up .
there's plenty of john gs for us to find .
all you do is moan !
i'm the one that has to live with what you've done .
i'm the one that put it all together .
you , you wander around , you're playing detective .
you're living a dream , kid .
a dead wife to pine for , a sense of purpose to your life ... ... a romantic quest that you wouldn't end even if i wasn't in the picture .
i should kill you .
quit it !
lenny , come on .
you're not a killer .
that's why you're so good at it .
come on , what are you doing?
you know what time it is?
it's beer o'clock , i'm buying .
fuck !
i'm not a killer .
i'm just someone who wanted to make things right .
can i just let myself forget what you've told me?
can i just let myself forget what you made me do?
you think i just want another puzzle to solve?
another john g to look for?
you're a john g.
so you can be my john g.
do i lie to myself to be happy?
in your case , teddy ... ... yes , i will .
hey !
hey , that's not your car !
it is now .
jesus christ , you can't take it !
why not?
because the guy you just killed owns it !
somebody'll recognise it .
you know , i think i'd rather be mistaken for a dead guy than a killer .
i might hang on to this for a while .
lenny .
look , don't ...
will you help me find the keys?
help me find my keys !
lenny !
lenny !
i have to believe in a world outside my own mind .
i have to believe that my actions still have meaning .
even if i can't remember them .
i have to believe that when my eyes are closed , the world's still here .
do i believe the world's still here?
is it still out there?
yeah .
we all need memories to remind ourselves who we are .
i'm no different .
now , where was i?
# we lay in each other's arms # but the room is just an empty space # i guess we lived it out # something in the air # we smile too fast # then can't think of a thing to say # lived with the best times # left with the worst
# i've danced with you too long # nothing left to save # there's something in the air # something in my eye # i've danced with you too long # yeah # something in the air # something in my eye
# abracadoo # i lose you # we can't avoid the clash # the big mistake # now we're gonna pay and pay # i guess you know # i never wanted anyone more than you # lived all our best times # left with the worst # i've danced with you too long # say what you will # but there's something in the air # something in my eye # i've danced with you too long
# there's something i have to say # there's something in the air # i've danced with you too long #
