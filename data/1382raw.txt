i'm talkin 'about friendship .  i'm talkin 'about character .  i'm talkin 'about hell , leo , i ain't embarrassed to use the word .
i'm talkin 'about ethics .
you know i'm a sportin 'man .
i like to lay the occasional bet .
but i ain't that sportin '.
when i fix a fight say i pay a three to one favorite ... to throw a goddamned fight .
i figure i got the right to expect that fight to go off at three to one .
but every time i lay in bed with this son of a bitch bernie bernbaum , before i know it , the odds is even up .
or worse , i'm bettin 'on the short money .
the sheeny knows i like sure things .
he's sellin 'the information i fixed the fight .
out of town money comes pouring in .
the odds go straight to hell .
i don't know who he's sellin 'to maybe the los angeles combine .
i don't know .
the point is ,  bernie ain't satisfied with the honest dollar he can make off the vig .
he ain't satisfied with the business i do on his book .
he is sellin 'tips on how i bet .
and that means part of the payoff that should be riding on my hip ... is riding on someone else's .
so , back we go to these questions friendship , character , ethics .
so , it's clear what i'm saying?
as mud .
it's gettin 'so a businessman can't expect no return from a fixed fight .
now , if you can't trust a fix , what can you trust?
for a good return , you gotta go bettin 'on chance ,  and then you're back with anarchy .  right back in the jungle .  that's why ethics is important what separates us from the animals ,
the beasts of burden , the beasts of prey .
ethics .
where as , uh , bernie bernbaum is a horse of a different color , ethics wise , as in he ain't got any .
you sure it's bernie selling you out?
it ain't elves .
no one else knows about the fix?
no one that ain't got ethics .
what about the fighters you pay to tank out?
we only pick fighters we know we can put the fear of god in .
any other bookies know?
you play anyone else's book?
i i lay an occasional bet with mink larouie .
but it ain't mink .
i'll vouch for that .
how do you know?
it ain't mink .
mink is eddie dane's boy .
of course the dane always knows about the fix .
and what the hell is that supposed to mean?
let it drift .
all it means is a lot of people know .
i guess you ain't been listenin '.
sure , other people know .
that's why we gotta go to this question of character ... to determine just who , exactly , is chiselin 'in on my fix .
and that's how we know that it's bernie bernbaum , the shmatte kid
'cause ethically , he's kinda shaky .
so you want to kill him .
for starters .
sorry , caspar .
bernie pays for protection .
listen , leo , i ain't askin 'you for permission .
i'm tellin 'you as a courtesy .
i need to do this thing , so it's gonna get done .
and i'm tellin 'you , as a courtesy , you'll have trouble .
you came here to see if i'd kick if you killed bernie .
well , there's your answer .
i pay off to you every month like a greengrocer a lot more than the shmatte , and i'm sick of gettin 'the high hat .
you pay off for protection just like everyone else .
as far as i know , and what i don't know in this town ain't worth knowing , the cops haven't closed any of your dives ... and the d. a. hasn't touched any of your rackets .
you haven't bought any license to kill bookies ,  and today i ain't sellin 'any .
so take your funky and dangle .
you think i'm some guinea fresh off the boat , and you can kick me .
but i'm too big for that now .
i'm sick of takin 'the strap from you , leo .
i'm sick of marching into this goddamn office ... to kiss your irish ass , and i'm sick of the high hat !
you's fancy pants , all of youse .
johnny?
you're exactly as big as i let you be and no bigger , and don't forget it , ever .
that's right , leo .
you're the big shot around here , and i'm just some schnook likes to get slapped around .
twist a pig's ear , watch him squeal .
bad play , leo .
who got up the wrong side , huh?
same side as always .  that's what i mean .
still owe money to
who is your bookie , lazarre?
i could put it right for you .
thanks , leo .
i don't need it .
in a pig's eye .
you haven't played a winner in six weeks .
people will speak ill of me if i let him break your legs .
people will say i had it coming .
and they'll be right , but that ain't the point .
call me a bighearted slob , but i'm gonna square it for you , yeah .
i think i'll do that this very same night .
lookin 'at you mopin 'around takes away all my
what do you call it?
joy de veever "?
joie de vivre .  well , if you're gonna laugh at me , the hell with ya .
the hell with you .
i'll square myself with lazarre , if you don't mind .
that's why god invented cards .
there is one thing you can do for me .
name it .
think about what protecting bernie gets us .
think about what offending caspar loses us .
oh , come on , tommy .
you know i don't like to think .
yeah .
well , think about whether you should start .
wake up , tommy .
i am awake .
your eyes are shut .
who you gonna believe?
how'd i do?
what do you think?
you are a millionaire .
you gonna remember your friends?
where's me hat?
you bet it , mug .
good thing the game broke up before you bet your trousers .
who made off with me hat?
verna .
verna and mink .
who?  mink and verna .
is thunderclap running tonight?
thunderclap?
yeah .
what's she leaving at?
three to one , more than likely .
lay off , tom .
you shouldn't go deeper in the hole .
tell lazarre ... i want 500 on the nose .
you would have it .
i want me hat .
is that all you came for?
yeah .
i want me hat .
it's mine .
i won it .
what are you gonna do with it?
drop dead .
i need a drink .
why didn't you say so?
hello , tommy .
sorry about the hour .
i'll live .
what's the rumpus?
can i come in?
sure .
drink?
i wouldn't mind .
i tried callin 'earlier .
i got home late .
well , uh , i'm sorry about the hour .
uh huh .
not bad .
better than the paint we sell at the club .
that it is .
that it is .
you thought about cutting bernie loose?
can't do it , tommy .
can't do it .
that's sort of why i'm , uh
tommy , i don't know where verna is .
uh huh .
i know what you re thinkin ', what else is new?
but the situation now i'm worried .
verna can take care of herself , maybe better than you can .
what does that mean?
want another one?
no .
what does that mean?
how far she got her hooks into you?
that's a hell of a question .
it's a grift .
if she didn't need you to protect her brother from johnny caspar , you think she'd still be going on slow carriage rides with you through the park?
that's the deal , isn t it?
you keep bernie under wraps till caspar cools down?
jesus , you're a prickly pear .
what's wrong with her wanting her brother taken care of?
nothing .
i don't blame her .
she sees the angle , which is you , she plays it .
she's a grifter , just like her brother .
probably had grifter parents and grifter grandparents ... and someday they're each gonna spawn little grifter kids .
stop it , tommy .
i don't like to hear my friends run down , even by other friends .
friendship's got nothing to do with it .
the hell you say .
you'd do anything to help your friends , like you'd do anything to kick your enemies .
wrong , leo .
you do things for a reason .
okay , tom .
you know all the angles , christ , better than anybody .
but may be you're wrong about this .
you don't know what's in verna's heart .
leo , if she's such an angel , why are you looking for her at 4 : 00 in the morning?
i put a tail on her this afternoon .
uh huh .
i asked rug daniels to follow her around , just , you know , to keep her out of trouble .
i was worried .
after that meeting with caspar , you can't be too careful .
so what did rug say that has you scurrying over here?
that's just it .
nothing .
he's disappeared .
so you lost your lady friend and the tail you put on her?
i guess it does sound pretty sorry at that .
help me out , tom .
i wouldn't know where to start lookin '.
you know rug's crowd .
you know the people verna runs with .
it's just i'm worried now with things the way they are between me and caspar .
you shouldn't be confronting johnny caspar .
that's what i've been trying to tell you .
you can't trade body blows with him .
he's gotten too strong .
i reckon i can still trade body blows with any man in this town .
except you , tom .
and verna .
okay .
give me the needle .
i am a sap .
i deserve it .
thanks for the drink .
let me know if you hear anything .
who was that?
leo .
he's lookin 'for you .
did you tell him i was here?
no .
did you put in a good word for my brother?
no .
you said you would .
i said i'd think about it .
what did you tell him?
did you see rug daniels last night?
no .
what did you tell leo?
i told him you were a tramp and he should dump you .
you're a son of a bitch , tom .
hello , tom .
what's the rumpus?
mink .
i see you got your hat back .
yeah , what of it?
not a thing .
look , if it ain't my business , i got not a thing to say .
listen , bernie wants to see you .
it's important .
yeah , well , i'm right here .
i'm not made of glass .
he's nervous walkin 'around in public .
he's a right guy , but he's very nervous .
i mean , who wouldn't be?
in the spot he's in , who wouldn't be?
he asked me to ask you to ask leo to take care of him .
leo listens to you .
not that leo wouldn't help a shmatte anyway .
a guy like bernie?
a straight shooter like him?
i don't get it , mink .
what's to get?
it's as plain as the nose on your face .
i thought you were eddie dane's sycophant .
yeah , tom , that's right , but a guy can have more than one friend , can't he?
not that i want the dane to know about it , but the shmatte , he's a right guy , tommy .
he's got a mixed reputation , but for a sheeny , he's got a lot of good qualities .
what's goin 'on between you and bernie?
nothin ', tom .
we re just ... friends , you know , amigos .
you're a fickle boy , mink .
if eddie dane finds out that you got another " amigo "
well , i don't peg him for the understanding type .
find out?
how's he gonna find out?
damn it , you and me ain't even been talkin '!
jesus , tom !
damn it !
jesus !
hello , tommy .
you know o'doole and the mayor?
i oughta .
voted for him six times last may .
and that ain't the record , either .
oh , verna turned up .
she's downstairs .
she say where she'd been?
no .
i didn t want to press her .
you hear about rug?
yeah .
r. i. p.
they took his hair , tommy .
jesus , that's strange .
why would they do that?
maybe it was injuns .  eye ties , more like it .
giovanni gasparo .
so you figure caspar bumped rug .
well , it's pretty obvious , ain't it?
yeah?
so what's the plan?
well , we'll jump on the guinea hard with both feet .
give him the low down , dale .
yes .
well , um ,
leo here just reminded us that mr. caspar operates ... several clubs in our city , wherein the patrons imbibe of rum and play at games of chance .
and we're supposed to stop the party .
they don't look to happy about it , leo .
oh , no , it ain't that , tom .
jesus , tom , we do as we're told .
maybe they're right not to like it .
stirring up this hornet's nest won't be good for anyone , and it'll mean killing .
i'm not thrilled about it either , but i can't just lay down to caspar .
you could do worse .
you might not like it , but giving up bernie bernbaum ... is a pretty small price to pay for peace .
business is business , and a war is going to hurt everybody .
bernie plays with fire , he s got to deal with the consequences . even if that means he gets bumped off .
sweet jesus , tom , that ain't even the point anymore .
caspar pooped rug .
the day i back down from a fight , caspar's welcome to the rackets , this town and my place at the table .
i didn't start this thing , but  you did start it .
you and verna .
we can dangle , leo , if you d prefer .
sit down , dale !
we're all friends here .
and caspar hasn't broken the rules , bernie has , and you , too , by helping him .
and if that isn't enough , consider that if you make this a war , you have more to lose than caspar .
okay , but more to beat him with .
jesus , tom , the two of us have faced worse odds .
never without reason .
it helps to have one .
well , it's your call .
my opinion used to count for something around here .
but it's always yours to take or leave .
come on , tommy .
it's not like that .
goddamn it !
goddamn kid's just like a twist .
get me a stiff one .
no small talk , huh?
they shoot your horse?
if there's any justice .
verna around?
she stepped into the ladies 'room .
you got lazarre's 500?
you'll have to carry me for a few days .
he ain't gonna like that .
couldn't you get it from leo?
it's not leo's debt .
i'll pay me own way .
i admire a man of principle .
does this go on the tab?
close your eyes , ladies .
i'm coming through .
who's the war paint for?
go home and dry out .
you don't need it for leo , believe me .
he already thinks you're the original miss jesus .
what the hell's the matter with you?
what's the matter with you?
afraid people might get the right idea?
leo's got the right idea .
i like him .
he's honest and he's got a heart .
then it's true what they say opposites attract .
do me a favor .
mind your own business .
this is my business .
intimidating helpless women is part of what i do .
then find one and intimidate her .
leo's upstairs ... getting ready to shoot himself in the foot on your account .
i don't know what you re talkin 'about .
he's gonna go to the mat ... for your brother , and it's gonna hurt him .
i don't know leo's business , but he's a big boy .
he used to be .
look , what do you want , tom?
you want me to pretend i don't care what happens to bernie?
well , i do .
he's my brother .
i don't want to see him get hurt .
if leo wants to help out , i il step out with him , show him a good time in return .
there's no harm in that .
there's a name for that kind of business arrangement .
look , i'll do what i have to do to protect bernie .
there's no reason for you to try and queer that .
regardless of what you think about me , bernie's a decent guy .
a straight shooter , huh?
a square " g.
yeah .
sneer at him like everyone else , just because he's different .
people think he's a degenerate .
people think he's scum .
well , he's not .
poor misunderstood bernie .
what is this about , tom?
you want me to stop seeing leo?
why don't you just say so?
i want you to quit spinning leo in circles and pointing him where to go .
i forgot .
that's your job .
i'll do what i have to do to protect leo .
i'm asking you politely .
leave him alone .
i don't have to ask .
if i told him about our little dance last night , your pool would pretty soon dry up .
so would yours .
i don't like being threatened .
i don't like being taken for a sucker .
that might work with leo , but it don't work with me .
do you think last night was just more campaigning for my brother?
i can see the angles .
you know , if there was a market for little old ladies , you'd have grandma bernbaum first in line .
you're a pathetic rum head .
and i love you , angel .
i suppose you think you raised hell .
sister , when i've raised hell , you'll know it .
yeah .
lazarre wants his money .
he wants it now .
i need a couple of days .
yeah?
how come is that?
because i don't have it .
all right , welsher , how do i know you ain't got it?
because i say so .
that ain't gonna be good enough .
what would be good enough?
lazarre ain't gonna like it one bit .
tell lazarre if he s not happy , he can send someone over to break my legs .
i won't squawk .
hello , bernie .
hello , tom .
what's the rumpus?
come on in .
make your self at home .
yeah , you weren't here , so i thought i'd do that .
i didn't want to answer the phone , though .
i figured ... it wasn't for me .
i get it .
get to the point , huh?
okay .
the point is , i'm a good guy .
i've heard that from a lot of people today .
good guy , lots of friends .
that's the way it works .
maybe if you appreciated me a little more , you wouldn't be making waves with leo .
it's a bad time to be doing that .
right now , we're both in a jam .
i hear you re on a bad streak .
short of funds .
well , i got that crazy dago mad at me .
don't ask me why .
i'm just a small timer ... trying to get by like everyone else .
i need help from my friends like leo and you .
leo gets your sister .
what are you sellin 'me?
come on , tom .
it's not like that at all .
it wasn't my idea .
she'll sleep with anyone .
you know that .
she even tried to teach me a thing or two about bed artistry .
can you believe that?
my own sister .
some crackpot idea about saving me from my friends .
she's a sick twist , all right .
she speaks highly of you .
yeah , well , you stick by your family .
the point is , i can help you with your debts if that would make us friends .
my motto is , a guy can't have too many .
big payday saturday , tom .
you could be in on it .
another fix?
which fight?
that's confidential at the moment .
but it doesn't have to stay that way .
how come you know so much about it?
caspar isn't laying any more bets with you .
you really must have mink jumping through hoops .
like i say , you can't have too many .
we got a deal?
i'll think about it .
i wouldn't want it any other way .
hey , adolph .
my credit still good with you?
mmm .
give me a hundred across on tailor made in the third tonight .
lazarre won't like it .
try 50 across .
i'll try .
it's another 1 50 you'll owe him .
only if i lose , adolph .
tommy , the way you re goin '
hey , horses got knees?
i don't know .
fetlocks .
well , if i was a horse , i'd be down on my fetlocks praying you don't bet on me .
drift , small guy .
drop dead , ape .
come on , tom .
boss wants to see ya .
he didn't have time to engrave nothin 'formal .
what you mean , he's eatin 'too much?
what's the goddamn doctor know?
what you eat for lunch?
a hot dog .
just a hot dog?
a hot dog and mustard .
a hot dog and mustard .
a hot dog and mustard !
you hear that , dane?
my kid is as smart as a whip .
even uncle eddie thinks that's funny .
okay .
go ahead .
which hand is the penny in?
choose again .
okay .
here you go .
take the penny .
shiny new penny .
take the kid , wait in the car .
give him a penny , boys !
i ain't got a penny , boss .
that's a penny you owe him .
hello , tom .
what's the rumpus?
you like kids?
no .
have a seat .
go ahead .
well , you're missin 'out on a complete life .
i know , kids , big deal .
still , i'm telling you .
anyways , thanks for comin 'by .
i just wrote this check out to your bookmaker lazarre .
it's for an even 1 , 500 , which is more than i hear you owe him , but i figured you could always use some money on the cuff , a high roller such as yourself .
what do you say?
thanks .
always they apper , huh?
well , you're welcome .
you wanna know why i'm puttin 'you square with lazarre?
not particularly .
i want everybody to be friends .
i do this , you're friends with lazarre , he's friends with you , you're friends with me .
all you gotta do to show you re a friend is give me bernie bernbaum .
you know it's the right thing anyway .
the shmatte steals from me .
i can't have leo giving him a shiny new penny .
so the deal is , i give you bernie , smooth it over with leo and you bail me out with lazarre .
yeah .
then we re all friends again .
you , me , leo , the dane .
we can maybe have tea sometime .
come on , eddie .
friends is a mental state .
what do you say , kid?
i'll think about it .
you'll think about it .
you hear that , dane?
the kid's a thinker .
that's terrific .
does he want a pillow for his head?
okay , kid .
think about it .
it's a mental state .
if it'll help you think , you should know that if you don't do this thing , you're not gonna be in any shape to walk out of here .
would that be physically , or just a mental state?
that ain't friendly , kid .
i make you a nice offer , you give me the high hat .
hold it .
jesus , tom .
just in the nick of time , huh?
well , no harm done .
unless your friend broke his foot .
where am i?
where are you?
johnny caspar's pleasure dome .
same as when you left us about ten seconds ago .
hello , tom .
how are ya?
care to scrape a knuckle on your playmate here?
no .
thanks though , andy .
well , if you change your mind , we'll be interrogating for a while .
what was that party about , anyway?
we do this every weekend .
jesus , what is the matter with you people?
well , they said make it hurt , so we make it hurt .
drink , o'doole?
i'm on duty .
to volstead .
any news about rug?
still dead , far as i know .
get a slug out of him?
yeah , . 22 .
listen , tom , i'm just the chief around here , so don't bother tellin 'me if you don't happen to feel like it , but what the hell is leo doin '?
make him listen to you , tom .
it ain't right , all this fuss over one sheeny .
let caspar have bernie .
what's one hebrew more or less?
we're burnin 'our meal ticket here .
leo will do what suits him , and you'll do what he tells you .
last i heard , leo was still running this town .
yeah , well , he won't be for long if this keeps up .
it's no good for anyone .
you said as much yourself .
first off , o'doole , i can say what i please to leo and about him .
you can t .
second , once leo decides , that's that .
if that sticks going down , there are plenty of coppers i know ... who wouldn't mind bein 'chief and could swallow it clean .
jesus , tom , i was just speculatin 'about a hypothesis .
i know i don't know nothin '.
it s just a just a damn mess , is all .
hello , officer .
i d like to report an intruder ... at 346 west lewis
who's this?
hello , shad .
tom reagan here .
you need the booze?
no , we won't be needing any today .
false alarm , huh?
yeah .
my mother .
she didn't recognize me .
let me talk to mulveany .
miss me?
drop dead .
mulveany here .
sean?
tell o'doole to get a car over to leo's tonight .
if we re banging away at caspar , we oughta be ready for him to bang back .
what do you want?
i was in the neighborhood , feeling a bit daffy , so i thought i'd drop in for an aperitif .
rug daniels is dead .
gee , that's tough .
don't get hysterical .
i've had enough excitement for one night without a dame going all weepy on me .
i barely knew the gentleman .
rug?
a bit of a shakedown artist , not above the occasional grift .
bet you d understand that .
all in all , not a bad guy , if looks , brains and personality don't count .
you better hope they don't .
yeah , well
we're none of us the saint i hear your brother is .
who killed him?
leo thinks caspar did .
but you know better .
i do now .
you see , caspar just tried to buy me into fixing his tiff with leo , which he'd hardly do if he was waging war .
so i figure you killed him , angel .
you or st. bernard .
why would i or my brother kill rug daniels or anybody else?
rug was following you .
he knew about you and me , and that wouldn't help your play with leo , would it?
you think i murdered someone?
come on , tom .
you know me a little .
nobody knows anybody .
not that well .
you know , or you wouldn't be here .
not at all , sugar .
i came to hear your side of the story .
how horrible rug was , how he goaded you into it , how he tried to shake you down .
that's not why you came either .
tell me why i came .
the oldest reason there is .
there are friendlier places to drink .
why can't you admit it?
admit what?
that you don't like me seeing leo 'cause you're jealous .
admit that you've got a heart , even though it may be small and feeble ... and you can't remember the last time you used it .
if i d known we were gonna cast our feelings into words ,
i'd have memorized the song of solomon .
maybe that's why i like you , tom .
i never knew anybody that made being a son of a bitch ... such a point of pride .
though one day you il pay the price for it .
okay , verna .
but until then , let's get stinko .
let's do something else first .
yeah .
let's do plenty .
** oh , danny boy **
** the pipes , the pipes are calling **
** from glen to glen **
** and down the mountainside **
** the summer's gone **

who's winning?
we are , for the nonce .
what's the disposish?
last night , four to one .
dana cudahy went up with the house .
and theirs?
one burned .
the other three?
lead .
whose?
leo's .
the old man's still an artist with a thompson .
yeah , do that .
well , find him , god damn it !
go and see if he fell in the john .
son of a bitch .
no chief .
who's mindin 'the goddamn store?
can t raise o'doole?
no , nor the mayor either .
that's not good .
they're running .
they wouldn t dare !
i don't know , leo .
i warned you not to hit caspar's club .
i'm still here , ain't i?
caspar's play hurt you anyway .
that sorry son of a bitch just slit his own throat .
listen to me , leo .
last night made you look vulnerable .
you don't hold elected office in this town .
you run it because people think you run it .
once they stop thinking it , you stop running it .
jesus , tom .
it sounds like a bad break for me i wasn't killed !
i mean it , leo .
start taking caspar seriously .
i know , i know .
retreat to win , give up bernie .
that'll solve all our problems .
won t anymore , i'll grant you that .
but going toe to toe with a psychopath will get you no where .
it'll force people to choose sides just when you're looking shaky .
the hell i do !
then where's the mayor?
why aren't there any police here?
why weren't there any police at your place last night?
i didn't ask for any .
i did .
mother hen , huh?
what's the matter , tommy?
don t you think i can take care of myself?
i know you can't .
here's the smart play , leo .
you lay back , you give bernie up , you let caspar think he's made his point .
then you wait for him to show a weakness .
please , tom .
you're sticking on bernie .
you're sticking your neck out ... for a guy who'd chop you off at the heels if there was two bits in it .
tom , things aren't as , uh , clear cut as you make it .
bernie's well , hell , you know about me and verna .
things now are , uh
not that i haven't been a gentleman , but
i plan to ask her to marry me , tom .
i guess you think that's a bonehead play .
you think she wants you to?
how the hell do i know?
i think she does .
yeah , of course she does .
i know you think different , but , well , we just , uh
we just differ on that .
leo , caspar didn't kill rug .
course he did .
no .
think about it just this one time .
who was rug following?
huh?
it needn't have been that sinister .
strange man follows her down a dark alleyway .
i told you she can look after herself .
verna wouldn t panic , shoot someone just because he was following her .
nah , it wouldn't have happened like that , and if it had she would have told me .
they pulled a . 22 slug out of him .
a pop gun , leo , a woman's gun .
i know you don't like her , tom , but i trust verna as much as i trust you .
okay , leo .
maybe it wasn't that innocent .
maybe rug knew something she didn't like him knowing and wouldn't want you to know .
rug was following her .
maybe he knew where she was sleeping , and who with .
maybes don't make it so .
there's more than maybes .
you've trusted me before , you've never lost anything by it .
trust me on this .
this is too important .
i don't ask much , and i don't ask often .
trust me on this .
tommy .
trust me on this , or to hell with you .
you don't mean that .
she was with me ... the night rug was following her , the night you dropped by .
oh .
**** [ irish tenor , indistinct ]
okay , leo .
okay .
i'll throw him out .
yeah , do that .
it's the kiss off .
if i never see him again , it'll be soon enough .
hello?
hello , frankie .
it's tom .
how's the funky business?
i've had worse .
your ventilator mending?
tell caspar it's forgotten .
i'd like to see him .
ah .
all right , let me know .
it worked , whatever you did .
leo says we're quits .
but you know i didn't have anything to do with rug .
maybe not .
anyway , that isn't what soured him on you .
oh , you and me , huh?
you always take the long way around to get what you want , don t you , tom?
you could have just asked .
what did i want?
me .
yeah?
yeah , yeah .
when?
okay .
you still up?
yeah .
what are you chewin 'over?
dream i had once .
i was walking in the woods .
i don't know why .
wind came whippin '.
blew me hat off .
and you chased it , right?
you ran and ran .
you finally caught up to it .
and you picked it up , but it wasn't a hat anymore .
it had changed into something else , something wonderful .
no , it stayed a hat .
and no , i didn't chase it .
nothing more foolish than a man chasin 'his hat .
where are you going?
just have to do a few things .
you and leo might still be able to patch things up .
me and leo are finished .
nothing's gonna change that .
you never know .
he's got a big heart .
we're quits as far as i'm concerned , never mind him .
and if leo did want me back , he's an even bigger sap than i thought .
then why don't we just pick up and leave town?
there's nothing keeping you here .
i know there's nothing keeping me .
what about bernie?
he could go with us .
you , me and bernie?
where would we go , verna?
niagara falls?
why do you hate him?
i don't hate anyone .
or like any one .
where is bernie?
why?
leo can't protect him anymore .
i oughta tell him to skip .
the royale , room 302 .
i guess we both double crossed leo , huh?
there's no gettin 'around that .
i guess he's well rid of both of us .
the two of us , we're about bad enough to deserve each other .
are we?
we're a couple of heels , tom .
yes , we are .
so he says , screw him .
give him a dollar .
this was my idea .
hello , tom .
uh , you know o'doole and the mayor .
hello , boys .
tom's a big booster .
always has been .
that's fine , that's fine .
well , tom and i got the proverbial fat to chew .
just let us know if you need anything .
yeah .
happy days .
have a seat , kid .
yeah , that's it .
so , you had enough time to think about things?
yeah , well , uh , circumstances have changed .
don't i know it .
last night i know the dane was disappointed the bulls showed up ... before frankie and tic tac really pinned your ears back , but i said , relax , eddie .
i got a feeling about this kid .
the kid and leo are gonna go bust o .
matter of time .
i said , the kid is too smart for leo . that's what i said .
like a psychic .
ask the dane if i did .
like a goddamn psychic .
go ahead , ask him .
you vouch for that psychic business?
that's right , smart guy .
i know you knew ... protecting the shmatte was a dumb idea .
i know you've been wise to all of leo's dumb ideas lately .
only a matter of time bust o .
that's why last night we didn t put the arm on you , only leo .
seeing how you squiffed your play on leo , i can only be so grateful .
oh , that's real brave coming from little miss punching bag .
okay , eddie .
friends now , huh?
nuts .
so , i guess you'll be looking for a job , eh , kid?
i might be .
you got references?
you been to college?
we only take eggs what's been to college .
ain't that right , dane?
i'm joking , of course .
we all know you could be useful to us , a smart kid such as yourself .
the man who walks behind the man , who whispers in his ear .
i guess you could be useful in spades .
yeah , i can do plenty for you .
can you get leo off me?
i'm tellin 'you not to worry about leo .
we got plans for him .
oh , yeah?
like what?
not so fast there , kaputnik .
i i think what the dane is trying to say is , there'll be time to talk about that .
we can table that for a later date .
see , last time we jawed , you gave me the high hat .
i guess i'm sayin '... you gotta put something on the table first .
ante up .
fair enough .
where do we start?
hear that , dane?
all business .
i told you he was a good kid . where do we start? all business .
well , we can start , for instance , with the shmatte .
like , where's the shmatte?
you could may be tell us that .
the royale , room 302 .
and you might find mink with him .
the hell you say .
sure .
bernie and mink are cozy as lice .
and it ain't just business .
this guy is lying .
why would i?
this guy is wrong .
this guy is all wrong .
mink is clean and this clown is a smart guy .
it's easy enough to find out , ain't it?
you find mink , you bring him back here .
go to the car .
i'm gonna send frankie and tic tac with you to the royale .
if bernie s there ,
frankie and tic tac'll take care of him .
and if he s not there?
i'll sit facing the corner in a funny hat .
get your little hebe ass in the car .
let s go .

i never killed anybody .
i used a little information for a chisel , that's all .
it's my nature , tom .
i can't help it .
somebody hands me an angle , i play it .
i don't deserve to die for that .
do you think i do?
i'm just a grifter .

no one can see you .
no one can know .
god bless you .
go somewhere no one knows you .
anyone sees you , you really are dead .
you're not my problem anymore .
of course not .
you've done your share .
thank you .
don't worry .
i understand .
shut up .
shut up .
thank you .
shut up .
get out of here before i change my mind .
god bless you .
put one in his brain?
yeah .
atta boy .
mink?
tom reagan .
where you been?
will you look?
eddie dane's been looking for you .
bernie's dead .
jesus christ !
stop wailing and listen to me .
caspar knows you were in on selling out his fix .
who the hell gave him that idea?
heh !
i guess i gave him that idea .
sorry .
it just slipped out .
what are you trying to do?
shut up and let me talk .
you lay low till caspar cools off .
then tell him the dane was in on the sellout , and i'll make caspar go easy on you .
you got me into this mess .
that's right , i got you into this .
just remember , mink , i'm the only one who can get you out .
wait a minute , tom .
waah !
uuh !
hello , terry .
getting out the vote?
a message from leo .
leo says if you re smart you'll sit this one out , not that he cares one way or the other .
leo says if you re on the wrong side you take your chances like anybody else .
leo says he gives no special favors , that's all .
tell leo he's not god on the throne .
he s just a cheap political boss with more hair tonic than brains .
uhh !
did leo say that as well?
no , i said that .
cross leo , next time i'll say plenty .
when you re right , you're right .
but you never say , i told you so .
so what am i right about?
well , i'll tell you .
but first you gotta promise not to say i told you so .
i never say that , and i don't like people who do .
mink was robbing me right along with the shmatte .
what convinced you of that?
mink took a powder .
we can't find him .
the dane , he s making excuses for him .
but personally , i think you was right .
i think that mink and bernie was in it together .
i think mink heard that you bumped the shmatte and lit out .
lousy son of a bitch .
i told you so .
what?
you got a lip on you .
that's all right .
i don't generally care for it , but that's all right .
you was a good sport to bump the shmatte .
how do you know mink skipped?
because the dane can't find him .
so he says .
meaning what exactly?
maybe nothing .
i didn't give it much thought , 'cause a guy'll say anything when his number is up .
but , uh, just before i bumped bernie , he swore tome that eddie dane and mink were setting him up that they were the ones who sold out your fix .
well , uh
well , like you say , uh , a guy'll say anything .
so why isn't eddie dane here?
well , he don't care for you , kid .
maybe it's only fair to tell you .
after you left us , he tried to sell me on a double cross .
he says tome , why don't we double cross you and give you the bump ... after we get the shmatte .
well , i figure a deal's a deal .
you're square with me .
you bump the shmatte , i hold up my end .
it's a question of ethics .
everything above board so everybody knows who's a friend , who s an enemy .
so the dane doesn't like you , but he wouldn't cross me .
we go back .
of course there's always that wild card when , uh , love is involved .
i know mink is eddie dane's boy .
still , i i don't make it that way .
then there's nothing to worry about .
yeah .
papa , papa , i got a prize from the sister !
papa , papa , i got a prize from the sister !
papa , papa , i got a prize from the sister !
yeah .
just a minute .
of course , then , there's no reason shut up !
papa , papa , i got
you take a page out of this guy's book .
a little less you talk , a little more you think !
kids .
you gotta be firm .
anyways , there's no reason not to check things out .
if mink is around , i want you to find him .
he can tell us what's what .
what's the matter?
somebody hit you?
what's the matter?
aren't we friends anymore?
if you find him , i wanna talk to him alone .
that's the way you get the straight dope man to man .
just me , mink ... and my friend roscoe .
you understand what i'm saying?
it ain't complicated .
you should leave town for a few days .
things are gonna heat up around here .
go to the palisades .
i'll join you soon as i'm done .
i can't find bernie .
did you find him?
yeah .
is he leaving?
he , uh he left .
he say where to?
he didn't say .
you  thanks .
what's that potato eater up to?
beats me .
that's bernie's sister , ain't it?
beats me .
what's he seeing her for?
beats me .
maybe
shut up .
get lost .
i'll see where the twist fops .
you know who i am?
yeah , johnny caspar's shadow .
what , did he stay in bed today?
jesus .
i open my mouth , the whole world turns smart .
you're leo's twist , right?
me and leo are through .
yeah?
so you re sluttin 'around with tom now , huh?
you get outta here .
okay .
see you later .
before i go , what's your boyfriend up to?
nothing i know about .
yeah?
that doesn't figure for me you dumpin 'leo for the guy who put a bullet in your brother .
he didn't tell you .
aww .
spin her , eddie .
ooh !
you leo's?
yeah .
he wanted her looked out for .
well , you did a bang up job .
i'll be sure to tell him .
where's leo?
if i tell you , how do i know you won't kill me?
because if you told me and i killed you and you were lying , i wouldn't get to kill you then .
where's leo?
he's moving around .
he's getting his mob together tomorrow at whiskey nick's .
you sure?
check it .
it's gold .
you know what , yegg?
i believe you .
go ahead and run , sweetie .
i'll track down all of you whores .
hello , bernie .
come on in .
make your self at home .
hello , tom .
i thought i'd do that , since you didn't seem to be in .
figured it was a bad idea to wait in the hall , seeing as i'm supposed to be dead .
how'd you know it was me?
you're the only one i know who'd knock and then break in .
your other friends wouldn't break in?
my other friends want to kill me , so they wouldn't knock .
what's on your mind .
bernie?
things .
i guess you must be angry .
i'm supposed to be gone far away .
i guess it seems sort of irresponsible , my being here .
and i was gonna leave .
honest , i was .
but then i started thinking ... if i stuck around , that would not be good for you .
then i started thinking that that might not be bad for me .
you didn't see the play you gave me .
i mean , what am i gonna do?
if i leave , i got nothing .
no money , no friends , nothing .
if i stay , i got you .
anyone finds out i'm alive , you're dead , so ...
i got i got you , tommy .
what's the matter?
you got nothing to crack wise about?
bernie ain't so funny anymore?
i guess i made kind of a fool of my self out there ... bawling away like a twist .
i guess
i guess i turned yellow .
you didn't tell anyone about that?
no .
of course , you know about it .
it's a painful memory ... and i can't help remembering that you put the finger on me , and you took me out there to whack me .
i know ... you didn't .
i know .
you didn't shoot me , but  but what have i done for you lately?
don't smart me .
see , i want to watch you squirm .
i want to see you sweat a little .
and when you smart me ... it ruins it .
there's one other thing i want .
i want to see johnny caspar cold and stiff .
that's what you il do for your friend bernie .
in the meantime , i'll stay out of sight .
but if caspar ain't stiff in a couple of days ...
i start eating in restaurants .
oof ! .
uuh !
you make me laugh , tommy .
you're gonna catch cold .
then you're no good to me .
what were you gonna do if you caught me?
i d just squirt a few , and then you'd let me go again .
hello , tad .
how's the club holding up?
we're managing to squeak by without you .
got lazarre's money?
no .
you're not supposed to be here since you turned rat .
relax , tad .
leo isn't around , is he?
last couple of days you booked any heavy bets on a long shot at saturday's fights?
why the hell should i tell you?
the truth is , tad , no reason on earth .
saturday's fights?
drop johnson put two grand on one yesterday on sailor reese , an under card bum .
drop johnson .
he play your book much?
are you kidding?
i didn't even know he could count .
jesus .
you bring them with you?
hello , brian .
still fighting the good fight?
hello , tom .
neither rain nor wind nor snow .
that's the mailman .
o'doole here?
hello , o'doole .
you don't look happy .
look at this mess .
guttin 'the golden calf again .
i don't know whether to laugh or cry .
yeah , it's awful confusing .
you know a yegg named drop johnson?
we spanked him a couple of times .
where does he flop?
terminal hotel , bay street .
jesus !
look , don't nobody ask me since i'm just the chief around here , but i'll tell you my opinion .
caspar is just as crazy as leo , and an eye tie into the bargain .
what's the matter , o'doole?
doesn't anything ever suit you?
hop in , tom .
we been lookin 'for you .
i'm busy .
hop in anyway .
you can't hijack me , tic tac .
we're on the same side now .
or didn t you get that far in school?
how'd you get the fat lip?
old war wound .
acts up around morons .
very smart .
what were you doing at the club , talking things over with leo?
don't think so hard , eddie .
you might sprain something .
you are so goddamn smart .
except you ain't .
i get you , smart guy .
i know what you are .
straight as a corkscrew .
mr. inside out ski ,
like some goddamn bolshevik picking up his orders from yegg central .
you think you re so goddamn smart .
you join up johnny caspar , you bump bernie bernbaum .
up is down .
black is white .
well , i think you re half smart .
i think you were straight with your frail ,
i think you were queer with johnny caspar ... and i think you d sooner join a ladies 'league than gun a guy down .
then i hear from these two geniuses they never even saw this rub out take place .
boss said to have him do it .
he didn't say nothing about  shut up !
or maybe you still got too many teeth .
everyone is so goddamn smart .
well , we'll go out to miller's crossing ... and we'll see who's smart .
**** [ frankie singing in italian ]
you understand if we don't find a stiff out here , we leave a fresh one .
where are your friends when you need 'em , huh?
where's leo now?
hey , tic tac !
you ever notice how the snappy dialogue dries up ... once a guy starts soiling his union suit?
**** [ continues ]
** [ stops ]
** [ resumes ]
okay .
there's nothing out here .
**** [ stops ]
**** [ resumes ]
think about this ... smart guy .
it's hanky time .
** [ stops ]
birds have been at him .
jesus christ .
told you to put one in his brain , not in his stinkin 'face !
i told you , dane .
we heard two shots .
hello , drop .
how are the katzen jammers?
hello , tom .
what's the rumpus?
had any visitors?
uhh , no .
not ever , drop?
not lately .
then you must be happy to see me .
so , uh ... you didn't see bernie bernbaum before he was shown across .
uh , no .
seen him since?
one last question , drop .
you got a lot of money on tomorrow's fight .
that your bet , or , uh ... you placing it for a friend?
no , no , no , it's my bet .
i just have a good feeling about that fight .
a good feeling , huh?
when did a feeling return to your head?
you've outgrown that one .
must be all the thinking you been doing .
tell bernie something's come up , he has to get in touch .
there'll be nothing stirring till i talk to him .
**** [ male irish tenor , indistinct ]
**** [ male irish tenor , indistinct ]
all right , anyone left in there , come on out grabbing air .
you know the drill .
aah !
hello , tom .
where you been hiding?
hither and yon .
is the mayor in?
he's with mr. caspar .
that's who i'm looking for .
scare me up some gargle , will you?
sure .
i'll announce you .
don't bother .
i'm well liked .
i can't do it .
i'll look ridiculous .
it simply isn't done .
assistants , maybe .
for a mayor , you don't hear so hot .
i said head .
head of the assessor's office .
but there are two of them .
i can count .
co heads .
johnny , needless to say , this office will do anything in its power ... to assist you and your cousins .
we did it for leo , of course , on countless occasions .
damn right .
had every potato eater from county cork on the public tit .
but there's a way we do things , hallowed by usage and consecrated by time .
when we put people on the pad when leo was running things  leo ain't runnin 'things !
i ain't interested in ancient history !
i'm runnin 'things now !
nobody can appreciate it more than i.
i can give them jobs .
i can give them good jobs .
i can even give them jobs where they won t have to perform any work , where their lack of english will be no impediment , but i can't
what is this , the high hat?
tom , can you explain it to him?
i can put them in public works , but i can't
you can do whatever the hell caspar tells you .
i don't remember all this double talk when leo gave you an order .
tom .
jesus !
stop whimpering and do as you're told .
you can start by gettin 'out of here .
johnny , it's my office .
get out of here !
take it on the heel and toe before i whack you one !
you two beat it .
yeah , go and keep the mayor company .
i'll take care of ya's later .
runnin 'things it ain't all gravy .
what's the fireworks?
knocking over one of leo's clubs .
son of a bitch won't go belly up .
i'm sorry , kid .
i heard about your little ride this morning .
yeah , well , sorry don't fix things .
we could just as easily have missed bernie's corpse , and i'd be dead now .
i know , i know , but that don't mean the dane's up to anything .
so he hears a rumor that bernie ain't dead .
these stories pop up .
any stories about bernie being alive the dane's made up himself .
you don't know that .
it don't make sense .
why would he?
there could be a damn good reason ... if you got a fixed fight coming up .
do you?
maybe .
okay , yeah , sure .
tomorrow night .
the fix is in .
what of it?
the dane know about it?
yeah .
okay , i get it .
if the dane's been selling you out on these fights and means to again ,
he's gonna have to have somebody else to point the finger at .
yeah , i get it .
with bernie dead , there ain't a hell of a lot of people he can point to .
yeah , the dane sells me out , makes pretend bernie's still doing it .
that's real pretty .
bernie leaked the fix , and you take the fall for not killing him .
but i don't know .
why would eddie cross me like that?
money?
okay , everybody likes money , but somehow it just don't seem like him .
and i know the dane .
nobody knows anybody .
not that well .
money don't mean that much to him .
then it's not just the money he's after .
he's got a wart on his fanny .
huh?
a warton his fanny giving him the fidgets .
maybe he's sick of sitting on the couch .
maybe behind your desk don't look like a bad place to move to .
kid , you got a lip on you .
but you re honest .
that's something we can't get enough of in this business .
i'll admit since last we jawed ... my stomach's been seizing up on me .
if the dane's saying we should double cross you
you double cross once , where's it all end?
an interesting ethical question .
i'll find the dane , talk to him , straighten things out .
sure , talk to him .
have a chat .
i'll take care of it .
ask him if he s selling you out .
i'm sure he'll come clean .
i'll take care of it .
you're swimmin 'in it .
i said i'd take care of it !
johnny .
my chin's hanging out right alongside yours .
i'd worry a lot less if i thought you were worrying enough .
but i am , kid .
christ .
running things .
yeah?
i got your message .
oh , bernie .
i had a dream about you the other day .
yeah?
a nightmare?
on the contrary .
very sweet .
i dreamt you were lying out at miller's crossing with your face blown off .
you get a kick out of that?
i was in stitches .
it's mink , isn't it?
i came back .
he wasn't happy to see me .
can you beat that?
some friend .
yeah .
you know what a nervous boy he was .
i figured you're a friend , maybe you could use some insurance .
did mink have a . 22?
he already ditched it .
why?
after he shot rug?
yeah .
how'd you know?
doesn't matter .
i've been thinking about our deal .
you can stick it in your ear .
huh?
you don't have anything on me that i don't have on you , so i'm calling your bluff .
wait a minute .
i'm pulling out tomorrow morning .
you only have to decide whether or not i leave behind a message for caspar ... that you re still around .
if you want me to keep my mouth shut , it's gonna cost you some dough .
i figure a thousand bucks is reasonable , so i want two .
in a pig's eye !
i'm going out .
i'll be back at 4 : 00 this morning .
if you re not here at my place , 4 : 00 , with the dough ,
caspar's gonna be looking for you tomorrow .
wait , wait , wait !
got any money?
no .
okay .
third race tonight .
by the finish , tailor made had a view of the field .
you oughta lay off the ponies , tom .
okay .
lazarre said he's sorry about this .
it s just getting out of hand .
yeah .
he likes you , tom .
he said we didn't have to break anything .
it's okay .
tell him there's no hard feelings .
heh !
christ , tom ... he knows that .
take care now .
tom reagan .
yes , sir .
mr. caspar's in the great room .
swell .
can you hold these?
kid , what's the rumpus?
i got news .
yeah .
news at this end too .
my stomach's been seizing up on me .
mink just told me that he  eh?
you talked to mink?
yeah , on the phone .
the dane wants you to think that he's disappeared so you can't talk to him ,
but he's been here in town .
you sure it was mink?
yeah .
see for yourself .
he's coming to my place , 4 : 00 this morning .
he's afraid of a crossing with dane .
he told me about the fix .
he says he'll sing for a couple of grand skip money , tell us everyone involved .
but you d better take care of the dane tonight .
mink says he's coming after us tonight .
leo's holed up at whiskey nick's dump .
what?
how do you know?
that ain't all we know , smart guy .
recognize your playmate?
you thought i'd quit , huh?
uh uh .
i followed you this afternoon , and i wondered why einstein would wanna talk to a gorilla .
so i grabbed the gorilla , and i beat it out of him .
you give me a big guy every time .
they break easy .
not like you .
is there a point , or are you just brushing up on your small talk?
i like that .
cool under fire .
i'm impressed .
the gorilla didn't know whose stiff we found , but i can fill that in .
you killed mink , you son of a bitch !
it was mink , you son of a bitch .
it was mink , and by god , i'll hear you say it .
is this how you told drop his story?
come here , bum .
i am gonna send you to a deep , dark place , and i am gonna have fun doing it .
oof ! .
you son of a bitch !
son of a bitch !
you lousy son of a bitch !
if there s one thing i can't stand , it's a double cross artist !
i had a theory about this son of a bitch !
shut up , you lousy son of a bitch , or i'll give you something to holler about !
johnny , it's okay .
the dane made him do it .
it's not important .
then make him shut it !
and we do the same to mink this very same night !
we can't double cross mink .
he wants to spill the whole setup .
i've never let a son of a bitch walk .
you've never crossed anyone .
4 : 00 , my place .
mink's coming in on his own hook , so i promised him the money .
don't make me out to be a liar .
look at this , kid .
something i try to teach all my boys .
always put one in the brain .
what's the rumpus?
i was just in the neighborhood feeling a little daffy .
what are you doing?
walking .
don't let on more than you have to .
in the rain .
bernie's dead , isn't he?
what makes you think that?
that's no answer .
i can't tell you anything yet .
no one really cares , do they?
his friends didn't really like him .
he didn't like his friends .
you're someone to talk .
you're a son of a bitch , tom .
you got me to tell you where he was , and then you killed him .
i want to know why .
what was in it for you?
nothing for me .
giving up bernie was the only way i could see to straighten things out for leo .
i thought you said you didn't care about leo .
i said we were through .
it's not the same thing .
i don't understand .
i don't care .
i don't care what reasons you had or you thought you had .
he's still alive .
you expect me to believe you?
no .
that's you all over , tom .
a lie and no heart .
oh
it isn't easy , is it , verna?
but before you even think about doing that , you gotta towel down .
so you towel down first with a hot towel , as hot as you can stand .
put the razor in cold water , not hot , because metal does what in cold?
i don't know , johnny .
that's why i m telling you !
it contracts .
that way you get a first class shave every time .
okay , johnny .
ain't it the life though?
hello , sal .
you can dangle .
hello , tom .
you sure?
you don't look so hot .
i'm okay .
i'll drive him home .
mr. reagan , there were shots .
go down to the drug store and call the police .
you'd better stay there till the officers arrive .
will my cats be all right?
yeah , they'll be fine .
i get it .
you set me up .
anything to avoid a little dirty work yourself , huh?
how'd you know he'd get it and not me?
or didn t you care?
i figured you'd come early looking for blood .
he wouldn't , so you d likely have the drop on him .
you're right .
the chump never knew what hit him .
but if you knew i d come to kill you , how do you know i won't still?
there s nothing init for you now .
with him dead , you and me got nothing on each other .
let me have the gun .
why?
pin this on the dane .
neither of us want him walking around after this .
the cops'll be leo's now .
they won t care what they hang the dane for .
i guess that's true , if you don't mind keeping the gun that killed caspar and mink .
why did mink shoot rug anyway?
i don't know .
it was just a mix up .
here .
so you re gonna say the dane did this?
sure .
mink thought rug was tailing him .
you know mink .
hysterical .
skin full of hop , head full of boogey men .
comes home crying one day , saying he had to pop one of the dane's spies .
rug was tailing verna , not mink .
mink just happened to be with her .
funny , ain't it?
mink was terrified the dane'd find out me and him were jungle dup together .
i bet you kept him worried about that to keep him under your thumb .
yeah , so what?
scratch , huh?
a little bonus .
why did mink take rug's hair?
beats me .
the kid was dizzy .
fifty fifty on the dough?
or maybe i should get more , since i did the deed .
okay , you keep it .
i want you to have it .
bernie ... we can't pin this on the dane .
why not?
because the dane's already dead halfway across town .
what the hell are you talking about?
eddie dane is dead .
it's gotta be you .
i mean , it was your gun .
what is this?
what the hell are you talking about?
you
you took my gun .
it's just your word against mine .
not necessarily .
are you crazy?
we're square .
you said it yourself .
we got nothing on each other .
yep .
so what's in it for you?
there's no angle .
you can t just shoot me like that .
jesus christ , it don't make sense .
tommy
tommy !
look in your heart .
look in your heart .
what heart?
tad?
it's tom .
tell lazarre i got his money .
yeah , all of it .
i wanna place a bet on tonight's fight .
they set you up downstairs?
how's that?
a little hooch , whatever?
thanks for coming , tom .
leo's real anxious to see you .
yeah , i happened to be near .
well , uh , actually this might not be the best time .
who's he got in there?
o'doole and the mayor .
i'll try again .
they're planting the sheeny tomorrow .
you could stop by .
big turnout .
drop dead .
she's under a lot of strain .
yeah , well , at least she didn't hit me .
glad you came , tommy .
i guess , uh huh?
she's taking the car .
i guess we're walkin '.
guess we are .
we're , uh we're getting married .
congratulations .
funny thing is , she asked me to tie the knot .
i guess you're not supposed to say that .
it doesn't matter .
congratulations .
thanks .
hell , tom , why didn t you tell me what you were up to?
i thought you d really gone over .
not that i didn't deserve it , but you could've told me .
telling you would only have queered things if it
there just wasn't any point .
i can see that .
it was a smart play all around .
i guess you know i'm grateful .
no need .
heh !
i guess you picked that fight with me ... just to check yourself in with caspar .
i don't know .
do you always know why you do things , leo?
sure i do .
it was a smart play .
fine .
jesus , tom , i'd do anything if you d work for me again .
i know i've made some bonehead plays , i know i can be pigheaded , but , damn it , so can you .
i need you .
things can be the way they were .
i know it .
i just know it .
as for you and verna , well , i understand .
you're both young .
damn it , tom , i forgive you .
i didn't ask for that , and i don't want it .
good bye , leo .
