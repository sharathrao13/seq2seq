the afternoon of a torturer
there's nothing in the universe without a reason .
if something occurs , either visible or invisible ,
it's because another thing , visible or invisible , provoked it .
a leaf which gets loose and falls ,
the ice that melts ,
the sudden awakening of somebody ,
the appearance of a little spot on the smooths surface of the skin ,
an earthquake , a flood ,
a plentiful harvest of wheat , an insect invasion .
all the phenomenae of the visible and invisible universe are bound to one and the same principle : the causality .
a beating of wings of a butterfly over the mediterranean sea
can start one cyclone in the pacific .
the world is full of miracles
that our spirit is not taking into account anymore .
why does the light cross this window pane
and not this part , there , in our train compartment
who's made of wood and steel?
or why doesn't it cross your body ,
as the x rays
who allow the doctor to see what we had for breakfast
or the customs officer to see what we have in our luggage
when we present them?
me , madam , i've always been concerned
by the rational demonstration of god's existence .
let's continue .
when we achieved to crack the atom ,
not so long ago ,
dear madam ,
we isolated an ultimate element ,
an ultimate , unsplittable element : the quark .
there , on top .
the fundamental stone of the universe .
what you see , in the shape of this triangle there ,
it's the material world as a whole .
but , by extrapolating ,
i prolong these two axes ...
and i obtain what?
this symmetric triangle to the first one , on top of it .
the immaterial world , the energy ,
usually called antimatter .
the material world is in a ceaseless movement ,
now , the movement ,
even if we consider it only within this mere train corridor ,
occurs in the time .
movement and time .
the movement and the time are inseparable .
their empire , it's there , this triangle below .
the upper triangle ...
do you know what they are , the hell and the paradise?
i believe that if we do bad things , we are in hell already .
for me the hell and the paradise exist with a psychological meaning only ,
they are within ourselves ...
but on the metaphysical plan , dear madam ,
they are outside ourselves .
the triangle of at the top represents the energy , in it's pure form .
or more simply the paradise .
and here , in the centre ...
god .
quod erat demonstrandum .
tandara !
you recognize me , tandara?
shall we go?
tell me , would you guess the occupation of our friend , franz tandara ,
during the last 35 years?
he practises a profession so subtle , i shall say even noble .
millennium .
ancestral .
a biblical profession .
the beekeeping .
where do we go?
madam asks where we go .
we go to the farm .
what farm?
it's not really a farm .
it's a little house ...
it's a hut ...
it belonged to my father .
he kept his sheeps in there ...
and now , i keep my bees .
there's a tree ...
it's beautiful .
we is going to eat there .
i brought some grills .
it's there where you buy the cheese?
what cheese?
you don't buy cheese from bulgaria?
i've never been in bulgaria .
never abroad .
but bulgaria , it's close .
no , i'm telling you .
i've never been there and i shall never go !
i've never asked of passport .
bees , they take me all my time .
and the hibernation of the bees in the forest , that takes place well?
i know not i believe so .
it's the first time , it's experimental .
towards the end of his life , he doesn't give up .
he searches , he 's experimenting .
van gogh !
please , look at this extraordinary yellow , the colour of eternity ...
the honey of sunflower , the sweetest , the most gold coloured .
and this damned car shit ...
i've got a new one , too , but my son dosn't allow me to use it ,
even if it's me who bought it , see? ...
who gave it to you?
say , eh .
i gave everything to him , i shall give him everything ,
if god will leave him alive ...
ticuta !
ticuta ...
don't leave me , ticuta !
seriously , one could swear this is a van gogh .
what shall i do without you , ticuta !
and the political parties , how is it going here , in giurgiu?
i've given him and i shall give him everything ,
if good god will not take him away from me .
because he is my punishment that comes to me from god .
it's your son?  yes .
but your son can not work himself?
no .
why?
because my son is only 37 years old ,
but he's got cirrhosis since he was 19 .
it's my sins for which i pay .
please , excuse these ...
the honey has a strong erotic connotation .
the honey of the eternal love in the song of songs .
the honey is symbol of eternity .
archaeologists have found honey
since thousands of years ago in clay vases .
isn't it , franz , that honey never deteriorates?
what did you say , mr luci?
you take it out finally?
if we leave it outside at night , they are going to steal it .
take the grills !
you have some packages in the car there .
some fruit juice?
no , no ...
bring some fruit juice .
please , enter , mr. professor !
please , make yourselves comfortable .
what is this?
it's you as a child?
yes ...
it's taken during the holy innocents day .
look , this one died .
this one also ...
this one's in australia .
that one , i don't know anymore who he is ...
please , have a seat , please .
thank you .
some coffee?
no , no ..
let's get started , we have a lot of work to do .
maybe we should stay outside .
it's nice outside , nice indeed , especially if the wind is not blowing from avicola .
no .
let's ...
that'll be fast .
the toilet , it's behind that tree .
no , no , thank you ...
do you also harvest the poison of the bees?
i stopped .
it's difficult .
and what method did you use?
narcotics
or the electric shock treatment?
the electric shock treatment .
for the electric shock treatment in bees , you need : a pulse generator ,
the electric source
and the electric surface
where bees gather .
check in the car , there's something for the ducks , too .
the pulse generator is an electronic device
fed by a 9 12v power source
which creates optimal electromagnetical charges .
optimal , for which purpose?
optimal to obtain the bee poison .
the wind comes from avicola .
please , tell her not to pass by anymore .
did you hear that?
stay away !
may i have something to put the flower in?
come here !
put this flower in the jar .
would it be possible?
i don't recall if i already introduced her , she's my wife .

at the beginning , this was his sheepfold .
he had 20 , 30 sheeps .
it was its sheepfold , all right .
but the law prevents you from inheriting ,
you killed your father , after all ...
it was a parricide
yes , you're right ...
parricide , it's the word of the lawyer .
this is the law , madam .
there's no law , everything can be bought .
what is this , " parricide "?
madam , on march 4th , 81 , when the doctors opened my son ,
they didn't even sew him back well . " take him " , they said to me . " that he dies in his bed .
they've had already burry him ,
but i , i persisted .
i was in the church and i prayed . " god , please don't take him away from me .
i'll stop searching for a treasure here , on earth but i'll search it in heaven .
i've flooded with my tears the paving stones of the church ,
but i held word ...
what if i didn't have that money , what would i've done?
nothing .
let's return to your father , how did you kill him?
yes .

when she married you , sdid she know who you were?
yes .
people said to her : " take care , he is going to kill you .
my mother told her , too ...
sit .
my mother was the first who told her : " you won't stay together long time . " " he has all bad parts of his father .
she was not afraid .
or maybe she was , but didn't show ...
but i was imperative .
when i said to her : " do that " , she had to do it .
and if she could bear my wickedness .
because i'm nasty , you know .
it's my partner for life .
please , go , bring some juice , this one is warm .
please , go !
you want me to tell you about my father?
look ... he sleeps , the poor man .
i heard rumors that he's getting into politics .
it's true?
please , ask him .
is that thing running?
yes , it runs , didn't i tell you?
from the train station ,
i went straight to the communists .
then i returned at my father's .
i was 15 . " i don't have anyone else but you " , he told me , my father ,
that moved me and i stayed with him and his sheeps . " you were wrong to leave us .
what are you now? " somebody told me
a wanderer , a shepheard .
another one , a big boss from the communist party , he told me : " if he had been my father , i would have knocked him out already .
shortly , i'll continue with the greatest misfortune in my whole life .
that took place during the autumn , on september 7th , it was tuesday .
at 7 am , a dispute burst between me and my father ,
because of his concubine .
he threatened me , he treated me as bolshevik : " go to hell , you damn bolshevik go to your damn party . " it's them , your friends !
i've asked him for a hat .
it was the autumn , september 7th .
he didn't want to give me anything .
then i decided to kill him .
i took an axe ...
why won't you give me the hat?
if there's a thing i regret , that's the little girl .
what girl?
ah yes , i forgot to tell you .
he had a little daughter from a woman who dumped him .
i washed her ) , i brushed her hair ...
i started to like her .
what happened to her?
she died ...
the evening of the fight .
it's there , near the tree ...
it's there that i knocked him out .
why do you keep calling?
i told you not to call anymore , didn't i?
my father had a sister .
i shall tell you , but we'll deviate from the subject .
no problem .
he had a sister , a disabled person , thin , a dwarfish .
she balanced while walking , like a duck .
he was a giant , and she , a duck .
slept well , professor?
no , i didn't sleep . it was just resting my eyes .
that's right , yes ...
she knit all day long .
i still see her kniting with those little hands ...
he took his sister to stay with him .
she had some terrain , and he wanted it , this terrain .
he told her : " it's not me , it's the boy , your giving the land to him .
i felt sorry for her .
i liked her .
if she won't give you the land , i'll send her away .
she , she told me : " your father is rapacious . " " and my daughters , then?
what will they say , my sons in law if i'll give you the land?
and then , one day , she had a heart attack .
i look at her , me touche ses small cold hands ...
auntie ...
auntie !
what did you do?
hey , you , get up !
damn you , you and your mother !
why you keep silent?
that's what i needed , to buy you a coffin ...
why you keep silent?
listen , we won't call the priest .
we'll take her at the edge of the field .
don't tell anybody that she died .
or maybe we 'll burry her right there , under the tree ...
but in fact she was alive .
i was really glad that she didn't die .
i made her a herb tea ...
some savage mint with some sugar , that was all we had .
i wet her lips .
a spoonful for mom ...
one for dad ...
one for me ...
damn you , you and your mother !
and now , what am i gonna do with the coffin?
i already paid for it ...
what , should i feed the pigs in it?
i'll kill you , i'll kill you both .
c'mon , dad , we'll settle that .
and the little girl , what happened to her?
the little girl?
she was swinging over there ...
when we fought she fell from swing ...
i think , i don't know for sure .
she died because of the fall?
i don't know , maybe ...
or maybe she died one year later ...
they say that her mother buried her there , under the tree .
but i don't think so , actually i know nothing about it .
do you remember her name?
no .
what did you do afterwards?
the little girl?
she was swinging over there ...
when we fought she fell from swing ...
i think , i don't know for sure .
she died because of the fall?
i don't know , maybe ...
or maybe she died one year later ...
please , put some clothes on you , it's getting cold .
please , let me bring it to you , professor .
that's how we eat them , cold .
avicola .
the first time , two civilians came .
they asked me if i knew how a psychiatric patient behaves .
a madman . " of course , i know . " we had one in my hometown in giurgiu . " and how did he behave? " " show me how he behaved .
he behaved this way , that way .
it was like a test , like you do with actors , for your movies .
ah no , god protected me , i'm not in themovie business .
oh yeah , got it .
i concentrated to imitate that madman , or even better , if possible .
bravo !
what else did you see him doing?
yes " , i said .
there was also vasilica .
he had legs like that .
vasilica was getting mad when someone irritated him ... " epileptics , did you see any?
ah yes , i sure did .
they do what?
they do that : " they jump in the air , the eyes rolled upwards , with foam in their mouth .
foam in their mouth?
how's that?
they retain the foam in their mouth first
and they let it go out later .
some of them don't have foam , they just roll their eyes upwards , that's all .
i never had that , so i didn't know ,
but i concentrated ...
i concentrated .
bravo " !
that they said to me .
and they laughed .
they'd liked well my number . " you act very well .
what was their interest to make you act like a madman?
all day long , everybody must believe
that you are a 'mentally ill person '" , they told me .
it takes a lot of talent , in the work camp i steered the artistic brigade ,
i acted in plays .
there ws a cultural committee with the actor mircea septilici there .
he died in canada , he even sent me a picture postcard from there .
go search the postcard for me !
the actor horia caciulescu was there , too . ,
he had his legs like the letter x , like vasilica .
they were writing the play .
and i saw it , aprooved it and played it . " sam the worker " , that's how they called the play .
up , jump , malagamban up , jump , don't stay
up , jump , in one foot mister exploiter
now's my turn to make you jump !
go get the photo .
and one evening , i hear : " that's it , tonight we get the job started .
they're bringing some guys that have killed soldiers in the mountains .
you know what have you to do?
i was told that you master the methods to make them speak the truth .
but no , i don't know any method .
nobody told me that .
what should i do?
how's that , comrade cocos , didn't he tell you anything?
i don't know cocos .
then we achieved nothing ! " " nobody goes out of here alive before they spit everything they know .
they began cooking them , but they got tired fast .
they were stupid , they knew nothing about torture .
a prisoner began to yell .
the militiaman arrives and says : " please , stop this torture .
here we don't torture them like that , it's forbidden .
you are not allowed to do that the patients must be relaxed .
and you irritate them !
there was nobody to form me .
and i , i'd never investigated .
then , a lady arrived .
she was a major .
she initiated me .
she was 30 old .
she seemed 15 .
a kid .
dounia .
she was from bessarabie .
dounia ...
she brought the materials : a torturer's chair
where we could attach their hands and feet .
but they needed the person to serve as a ...
guinea pig .
there was a certain banu there ,
a prisoner of common law , he was incurable .
he wasn't even aware any more ,
he was in the coma .
let's sacrifice this one " , she says . " we'll take him as an example .
to show me how to knock with the pencil .
and you struck them where?
on their testicles .
yes , on testicles .
yes , yes , on testicles .
a long , non cut pencil , with which we struck them on their testicles .
after she showed me on that prisoner ,
i still had enough to learn .
she said to me : " in time , you will become an expert .
i became an expert later ...
you found it?
what is this doing here?
are you blind?
answer me , are you blind?
ok , darling , it's allright .
keep searching it .
i became an expert later ...
nobody is born learned .
every evening , from 11 hours ,
the inquiry started again until 4 5 in the morning .
the first one on which i experimented didn't survive for long .
in the morning he entered in a coma , he didn't say anything more .
his testicles darkened , inflated , inflated a lot ...
it was inexplicable .
who's this woman?
who , that one?
a colleague , from timisoara .
irma .
i'd become a machine , a brainless robot ...
and this one?
it's the same .
and all these are near this tree?
yes , near this tree .
what wabout the prisoner , burned in the oven by stanciugel?
yes , in the oven of the brickyard .
there were some gipsies working there , gipsies from transylvania .
they've argued with stanciugel .
the gypsy was offended , he's beed called " colored " .
to the appeal in the morning , an absentee . " where is he?
they searched for him all day long .
in the morning , i said to the commander in chief : " he burned , sir , in the oven .
don't say a word " , he told me . " we'll report him as fugitive .
it's stanciugel who threw him in the oven?
i know nothing about it .
would you excuse me for a minute .
that night , two gipsies from turda were feeding the oven .
just like that , they've seen a big greenish flame .
no smoke , just flames .
i think these two did it ,
he couldn't have thrown himself in there .
just my two cents ...
the next day , people of the constanta public prosecutor's office arrived .
stanciugel comes to me , he says to me : " don't tell anyone that somebody told you it smelled like burnt flesh .
stanciugel asked you for that?
yes .
because that smelt bad .
everybody could smell it .
the prisoners went to the toilet , behind the sheds .
all those who've been there that night smelled that .
the guard awakened me : " tandara
tandara , that smells burned , here in the back !
i went there , it smelled , yes , and some bones were burning .
i removed from the fire a man's leg .
the morning , i told the commander . " it's nothing " , he sayd . " you dreamed about it .
sir , but ...
you keep your mouth shut !
don't say a word !
understood?
do you know the name of the burned?
i knew it .
i forgot .
most of us were criminals .
there was brganu there .
there was badea there .
there was one sentenced for 15 years .
he'd killed his mother .
and then epuran ...
we were numerous . heartless persons .
why do you say you were heartless?
for example ,
the dead ones were in a bathroom on some grids .
we couldn't have left them on the floor .
we arranged them on some grids .
naked .
and we played with them ...
how's that , you played?
we were not mentally healthy ...
a mentally healthy person wouldn't have done such things .
how did you play with the dead?
as the girl had taught us .
we played to stick them with one's nose in the ass of the other one ,
stiff as they were .
they were light , 'bout 40 kilos ...
the skin on bones .
the skin which dangled , we called that ...
the " apron " !
bravo !
he didn't forget that .
yes , the apron .
the chain of your dog it's so short ...
my colleague throwed them into the cart .
i ran away rather that carrying them
however , that was 20 kilos for him , 20 kilos for the other one .
the strong ones among us were having fun to throw them in the air , as high as possible .
they fell again , with their heads on the arms of the cart ,
there was a whole mess ...
the officers of the securitate , the corporals came to assist ...
and they'd a good laugh , they joked .
and we laughed , too .
did anybody count them , these dead?
did you know their names?
what names?
count them ...
why?
we threw a blanket over them and they left in that cart !
the transport was made at night .
yes .
during the day , the excavator dug the hole .
i'm telling you , we were true brutes .
but you were also forced to do it .
forced?
nobody froced us !
i agreed !
they didn't threaten me .
i swear in front of god , it would be a lie to say that i was forced ..
in 51 , when they've told me they'll release me ,
you know what i said?
i said like that : " not , please , keep me here some more time .
you understand? " keep me here some more time .
this means i liked it , madam .
what do you think , am i crazy?
over there , nobody ever tried to open your eyes?
didn't you ever have time to remain alone and face your sins , your decay?
why did the questioning took so long?
10 12 hours for a page or two?
in which tortures have you participated
as witness and player?
you don't want to tell us anything more?
the evening of my departure ,
when they let me go ,
i turned and i saw the barracks ,
it was as if i left my own home .
i was crying .
what am i going to do?
it was so good in there !
it was not perfect ...
but it was my home , and i liked it .
you said that you searched for some of your colleagues .
executioners as me .
i went to find them , yes . " c'mon , let's confess " , i told them .
what did they answer? " are you crazy?
do i look crazy like you
i've children to raise " , they said . " you want my kids to leave me?
listen , the communiste will regain to power .
that one , he raises pigs . " wasn't it good under the communists? " didn't we manage to live well?
another one , vasile , his daughter is a school teacher in bucharest . " when my daughter will hear that " , he told me ...
i want to die in my own bed .
and his daughter , does she know what he was?
of course she knows .
and your child , he knows?
just go there and keep searching over there .
you're stuck here , or what ...
your child , he knows?
my child is very upset against me , madam .
in the recording done with the professor ,
you said that you couldn't resist more than a month .
at the end of a month , i felt i was turning mad .
once , i stayed there two months .
did you also tortured common law prisonners?
that arrived .
i heard you also tortured teenagers .
is it true?
once we had a pilot , a young boy , practically a child .
he attempted to flee with the plane .
i did him a torpedoing .
what's that , torpedoing?
electrocution on his feet .
that is electric shock treatment .
same as for bees?
yes , same as for bees .
later , she kicked himon his testicles .
he wasn't dead yet , but he couldn't speak anymore .
then she burned his testicules with a cigarette .
always that girl , she was doing it?
yes , her ...
other times , made me do it ...
who made you?
she did .
and all this time , she ...
she , what?
about what does franz tandara dream?
all those who did as i did , they dream the same way .
very bad dreams .
i dream about those who , when we remained alone ...
fell on their knees and implored me to spare them .
my only concern was not to leave any marks .
there was one , marin constantinescu ,
who took charge of our education .
he said : " we appear on certain lists
saying that we are commiting crimes agains humanity .
you understand?
crimes against humanity .
be careful not to commit crimes against humanity " .
no blood .
hidden .
no blood .
it was its favorite expression . " no blood .
then we gave up kicking the testicles ,
as it's been a crime against humanity .
then the woman came and showed us
how to beat them with sandbags .
they were stockings filled with sandat the bottom .
they left no track ,
not even red spots on the skin .
but the lungs detached .
the person was spitting and then died .
what else do you dream of?
i dream about the patients in room n2 in the hospital .
about 20 beds .
there were madmen , real ones ,
but there were also a few , one or two , brought for questioning .
my task was to prevent them from sleeping all night long .
somebody came to me and told me : " look , the fat one in the bed number x
as soon as he fell asleep , i struck him with the sandbag .
there were about 20 patients in that room ,
well , not even one ...
you understand?
not even one ...
ever tried to help another , none ever jumped at me .
naturally , i had a big bat under my bed .
how much did they pay you for what you were doing over there?
5 000 lei .
what was a regular salary , at that time?
a few hundreds of lei .
but i couldn't do it for more than 3 months .
how did you return in there?
they relieved me of duty during the winter of '55 .
the night of christmas 1955 .
i was very confused .
my place , it was over there ...
i couldn't live with my freedom .
freedom terrified me .
how much did you remain outside?
about nine months .
unfortunately , i didn't have any talent for foreign languages .
what's the connection here?
if i'd learned a foreign language ,
they would have sent me abroad .
to do what?
to terminate one or another .
and then i'd have returned ...
but , i didn't have talent for languages , so i remained here .
after almost one year of wandering through the country ...
i returned to them .
today , almost 50 years later ,
do you imagine yourself outside the danger of killing a man?
no , i don't feel outside of this danger .
on the contrary , i'm afraid that i could do it again .
you smoke?
yes , a lot , more than two packs a day .
and during all this interview , you've been able to refrain yourself?
i've a lot of will .
yes , i have that .
of what are you afraid?
didn't you become more ...
more human?
non , i haven't become more human .
my nerves have weakened .
i'm not capable anymore even to bandage a wound ,
i can't bear seeing the blood anymore ...
maybe , more human , or rather a nervous breakdown .
my wife , she knows about it .
she never asks me to sacrifice a chicken .
but my daughter in law , she's deliberately doing it .
laughing , she says : " who's going to kill the chicken?
a man should do that ...
yes , my nerves are weakened .
i even wanted to see a psychiatrist , to tell if i'm sick .
rumania !
tandara , informer , " " the one selling the country away
tandara , little dick " " we're going to fuck you , man
tandara , you've got no balls " " you sell the country for dollars
the sold , " " out of the country !
that's enough , the lads !
dad !
do you hear me , dad?
come here , i've got something to tell you .
what are you doing , dickhead?
good afternoon , miss .
mr. professor , i greet you .
tell me , dickhead , what do you think you're doing?
i told you to calm down , didn't i?
why son't you want to calm down?
why?
you want to confess?
go see a priest , and confess .
hear the bells?
it's close .
go and confess . " please , forgive me , father , as i have sinned . " " i played with the dead ,
i fucked them in the ass .
but no , you don't go cto see the priest , you dickhead .
you go to radio dustbin .
you do it to your whole homeland !
you sell it !
your homeland , that's all you have .
you sell it and you shit on it .
how much did they pay you for that?
you pretend you've got balls .
you hang up the phone in front of mr teodoresco .
you hang up the phone in front of him?
hey , dickhead , do you see my pals over there?
you see them?
dickhead , we're going to set you on fire .
shouldn't we do it ...
we're going to see the game now .
we kick their ass , and on the way back we set you on fire .

we set you on fire .
it was ticuta .
he's going to see the game with his pals .
he is very angry .
very angry on me .
may god not take him away from me .
bring us some honey .
old monkey !
stick it up your ass !
dirty blind bitch !
old bag , blow me .
kiss my ass !
come on , my baby my baby ...
there , there , stop crying , i am here .
i'm going to bring you some honey .
me , i steal everything .
this profession , i've stolen it from a hungarian .
he said : " the profession must be stolen , if you're smart . " " don't steal anything except for the profession and the knowledge .
and i stole !
go bring me the small axe .
it's a metaphor .
because if i stole your hive ...
sure that it's a metaphor .
it's true .
it's a metaphor .
it's what i say .
it's a metaphor ...
don't steal the goods of others .
but the profession , steal it .
it's a metaphor .
the ancient greeks said : " the beekeeping and the theft , they're sacred .
you read that somewhere?
i read it , mr luci .
it's a paradox , tandara .
i know .
what 'that white flag doing here?
it's the flag of beekeepers from giurgiu .
before , i wandered all over the country with my bees .
now , i'm old .
i took my hives with me .
it's so beautiful , our country !
why go somewhere else , when you have such a beautiful country?
i've never been abroad , not even to bulgaria .
you're allright , my beautiful?
you're beautiful .
are you beautiful !
i'd like to ask you another question .
you said you tortured a dying person ,
you " practiced " on him .
with a woman .
which woman?
the same woman?
stop asking those questions .
please , stop torturing him like that .
sorry . " sorry , sorry ...
in your opinion , how many persons died like that?
maybe a hundred , only with me .
you said a hundred?
on the tape recorded with the professor ,
you said you've done a " good job " of which you're ashamed .
it was going well , the job .
i was good at what i was doing .
i couldn't do it anymore , they started loving me .
loving "?
who loved you?
those were the good things .
and there are other things i cannot speak of ...
it's too hard .
why did you keep those pictures?
which relation you've ...
madam , don't you understand?
do i speak chinese?
leave the damn pictures alone !
you'd better knock him in the head with this axe , please , kill him , but stop torturing him .
i'm begging on my knees .
your train , when is it?
at 8 8 : 15 at 8 : 23 ...
well , then , make sure you don't miss it !
c'mon , help me clear the table , they must be in a hurry .
here's the hatchet you were seekeing .
she doesn't want me to tell anything , and neither does her son .
nobody wants ...
the honey , are you still eating it?
no , you're not .
she is very angry on me .
his son is angry , too .
they are all very angry ...
everybody's very angry ...
i'm very confused .
i wanted to be judged by somebody .
i can not be my own judge ...
i seeked the chindren of those whom i'd made suffer . " please , return tomorrow ... or on wednesday ...
nobody wants to listen .
what should i do?
wait to die so god judges me?
maybe .
but i want to do something over here , too .
to do something good , as of the evil , i made enough of it .
i seeked the professor , some 5 years ago ,
to the association of the former prisoners .
poor man , he fell asleep again ...
he is very tired .
i wanted those who sufferd to judge me ...
then when i've seen that not even him seem to care ...
i keep silent .
what did i tell you?
it's nothing , nothing compared to what happened .
one day , madam , you children will be grateful .
they'll be proud of the example given by your husband .
oh , madam not even my grandson ...
when he will be a grown up , he will not forgive me ...
oh , such an idiot grandfather ...
oh , what a disgusting grandfather ...
tandara , come here !
stay there , on your four paws , you stupid dog .
i doubt if they'll refrain from making me sleep in the doghouse .
that , i seized it from a prisoner .
a sas , named reiter .
he had it attached to the bars of the cell's window .
he never wantd to say how he got it ...
may he rest in peace .
it's in this train that i embarqued my old aunt , 50 years ago .
i was a child then .
i liked her .
the second time , she couldn't escape the death .
it's me , i killed her .
how did you kill her?
take her far from here " , said my father . " i don't want to see her anymore .
and where should i take her?
in hell , or wherever you want .
don't return her here anymore ,
or i'll kill you . " " i'll kill you , and i'll also kill her " " i'll kill you both . " " stay here !
don't you dare to return home , you old whitch !
if you keep following me , i'll kill you .
then she cursed me : " may the plague take you all .
why do you curse me?
i didn't do anything to you .
i believed that you had you good heart , that you loved me .
what can i do?
it's your brother ...
from time to time , she turned her head like a beaten dog
and then , she saw me there ...
stayng there , with my bat .
she understood that if she turns back ,
if she doesn't obey ,
i'd beat her up .
nobody ever heard of her again .
wolves may have eaten here over there , on these hills .
thats how they all died .
the last one to die was dounia .
alcoholic , in the last degree .
she burned alive because of a cigarette .
or maybe she set herself on fire , then threw herself through the window ...
i don't remember anymore .
i'd like to ask you another question .
you said you tortured a dying person ,
you " practiced " on him .
with a woman .
which woman?
the same woman?
stop asking those questions .
please , stop torturing him like that .
sorry . " sorry , sorry ...
in your opinion , how many persons died like that?
maybe a hundred , only with me .
you said a hundred?
