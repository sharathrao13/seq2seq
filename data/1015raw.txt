ha !
i love it .
i know .
i know .
wait a minute .
no , it's great .
okay , that was a one more .
time for one more .
okay , you know why guys like doing it in front of the mirror?
why?
objects may appear larger .
that's a good one .
anyway .
oh , that's a good one .
i heard that in the beauty shop this morning .
but seriously .
dee?
huh?
that other thing we were talking about before .
come on .
i mean , he can't just ignore you all night , stay glued to the tv like some zombie ... and then expect you to turn it on like a lightbulb .
i mean , i wouldn't put up with that .
i mean , you're either interesting or you're not .
ask him to decide .
can i write that down?
all right .
i'm either interesting or i'm not .
he'll shit a brick .
hmm .
what if he says i'm not?
he won't say that you're not .
trust me .
okay , i did it .
i told chaim i wasn't moving to israel .
yeah , good .
and?
i said what you said .
he can be a writer anywhere .
if i'm going to be in advertising , i need to be here and not there .
and then he said?
i don't know .
it was in hebrew .
ooh .
but i don't think it was , " you got it .
see you next tuesday .
i don't know .
i'd wait it out .
he'll call you .
i can't .
i better call him back .
be strong .
he will call you .
well , girls , been nice chattin '.
i gotta get back to work .
can i make you a sandwich?
no , i'm cool .
really .
but thank you , anyway .
this was fun .
aww !
huh .
this is good .
more insightful than i would've thought .
this line doesn't feel exactly right .
if you're thinking that line isn't perfect , i agree .
it needs work .
there's something not exactly right about it , isn't there?
i mean , it's not bad .
it's insightful , actually .
it's just
well , what do you think this woman's thinking?
uh , well , i
let's see .
uh , she's thinking about what she wants out of life .
what's she gonna accomplish?
how's she gonna do all that?
women , you know , they think about that a lot .
i mean , surprisingly a lot .
they worry all the time about everything .
you're so right .
how do you know that?
well , you know , even i had a mother .
well
so maybe running gives her time off from all of that .
it gives her something she can't get anyplace else .
look at her .
god .
i want to be her .
she looks so free , doesn't she?
no one's judging her , no boss to worry about , no guys to worry about , no games to figure her way through .
i like that .
no games .
that's good .
that'd be nice in life , wouldn't it?
okay , can i just think for one second?
take your time .
okay .
okay .
no games .
how do i get that in?
she's running .
it's early , it's quiet .
just the sound of her feet on the asphalt .
she likes to run alone .
no pressure , no stress .
this is the one place she can be herself .
look any way she wants , dress , think any way she wants .
no gameplaying , no rules .
games , sports , rules .
games , sports , rules .
playing by the rules .
playing games versus playing
playing by the rules .
playing games versus playing
why are you nodding?
because you're onto something .
am i?
aren't you?
well , i was thinking about a play on words .
something about games versus
i feel like i was onto something good .
playing games versus playing  sports?
yes !
thank you .
do you like any of this?
a lot .
i like the idea that you can be yourself on the road .
i do too .
did i say that out loud?
no , i was just
'cause i was circling around the exact same thing ,
which is great , we're on the same  yeah .
sorry , i'm not thinking straight .
my glands may be swollen .
maybe they should be more swollen .
you're doing great .
nike .
no games .
just sports .

all right .
did he come up with that , or did i?
boy , can i be

i didn't know you were gonna be that honest .
sorry .
i'm sorry .
no , that's all right .
no , that's okay .
you must have looked so forward to meeting me .
i was dreading it .
i had this whole other person built up in my mind .
well , since we're sharing , i heard a few things about you too .
yes , i'm sure .
i'm the " man eating bitch darth vader " of the ad world .
verbatim .
really?
all right .
well , nice to meet you .
that's not who i am at all .
just for the record , i don't think that's who you are .
i don't .
thank you .
i appreciate that .

don't fall for a guy at work .
don't fall for a guy at work .
don't fall for a guy at work .

why won't why don't i just work on these storyboards ... and then bring them back around to you tomorrow if you're free .
i'm free .

i just looked at his penis .
i hope he didn't see me .

yeah , i'm fine .
are you laughing at me?
yeah .
good .
i didn't think anyone else was still here .
i didn't know anyone was here .
what time is it?
it's after 1 0 : 00 .
i didn't realize it was so late .
i feel so alone .
um i didn't catch that .
sorry?
i didn't realize how late it was .
and i'm glad you're here .
i'm stuck .
i feel so alone .
you want a hand with this?
no , thanks .
i'm okay .
yeah , i'm not buying it .
what's going on?
well , i have an early meeting tomorrow with dan , and i wanted to make it later so i could be more prepared .
but then you slipped in there and took the only time he had left , which left me with 8 : 15 tomorrow morning .
it's fine .
i'm just not as ready as i wish i was .
sorry .
you didn't do it on purpose .
i just don't want him to be disappointed .
hey , why don't we go through some of these together?
really?
i insist .
unless you're too tired .
oh , no .
i'm not tired .
yeah , i can see that .
it's just so far beyond tired at this point .
i've basically stopped sleeping ever since i took this job .
you have?
yeah , it's weird .
i , um how do i say this?
you don't feel quite like yourself here , do you?
no , i don't .
not yet , anyway .
boy .
plus , i'm mad that i'm getting sick .
i never , ever get sick .
in fact , you don't have to sit so close to me if you don't want to .
no , come here .
i'll brave it .
so , where do we kick off?
control top panty hose?
okay .
personally , i think they do the trick .
you've worn control top panty hose?
did you put a pair in the box?
seriously?
oh , yeah .
you are full of surprises .
yeah .
no , no , no .
i mean that as a compliment .
i love that .
and how did you look in them?
ooh .
hot .
my daughter and her boyfriend walked in , and i got 'em on with
and they said what when they saw you in your panty hose?
it was the turquoise wonderbra they noticed .
then , the nail polish .
the dress you picked out is totally hideous .
i'm not coming out .
it can't be that bad .
come on out .
i look like a nun an ugly nun .
why?
because it's gray?
gray is the new black .
if he says he likes it , i'll die .
okay , next .
this , i love .
thank you .
next .
i think this is the one .
i like that no , i love that .
okay , this is it .
let me take a look .
yes !
i look older .
this is great .
oh , god , i need boobs .
oh , i'll buy a padded bra when he's not around .
i can't believe this is what i'll be wearing the last night i'm a virgin .
or what i'll be taking off .
alex?
hmm?
i wanna talk to you about something that's pretty important .
i've never talked to you about  oh , god .
he's actually gonna try to be a dad .
this should be hilarious .
i realize i haven't been the perfect dad .
understatement of the century .
can you pass the bread?
yeah , sure , sure .
but that does not mean i don't have the right ... to talk to you about about
about?
all right .
you're a young woman now , and you may be flirting with the idea of of
having sex?
um , can i get a lemonade , please?
well , you know , boys and girls think very differently about sex .
my hunch is girls just want guys to like 'em and hang out with 'em .
whereas guys and not all guys , allright?
but most guys , they pretty much just wanna have sex .
okay , i'm what i'm trying to say here is ,
i don't want you to feel pressured ...
because your boyfriend's older .
please .
save it .
mom had this talk with me when i was , like , 11 .
you're supposed to have sex when you're in love and it's special .
i know everything .
and mom knows me for real and knows my friends and cameron , so let's leave the parental talks up to her , okay?
i promised cameron i'd do it .
oh , jeez .
and also , let's not make me part of this nick makeover ... or whatever this new thing you're into is , okay?
what new thing?
what new thing?
this ridiculous new guy you're trying to be .
clowning around with me?
asking if we can make a salad?
watch friends together?
i mean , it's nuts after 15 years of no relating .
i mean , come on .
who are you to talk about relationships anyway?
you never had a real relationship with anyone in your entire life .
look , i'm supposed to meet my friends .
so i'm gonna go , okay?
sure .
thanks for the dress .
she didn 't even finish her lunch .
johnny come lately , giving her advice?
oh , teenagers .
i think the talk worked .
she's totally right .
move on , dude .
it's over .
please .
now you've seen how the cake is assembled .
the next time you admire a wedding cake , you'll be able to appreciate
wow .
it looks so gorgeous .
fit , vibrant hair .
oh .
i hated being overweight .
i always wanted to be thin and pretty ... and wear cute little clothes .
it built and it built , and my health deteriorated .
and i couldn 't walk and i couldn 't stand ... to even stand up at the park for ten minutes while my kids played .
i tried sitting on the swings , and the chains cut my hips and it hurt .
and i couldn't i couldn 't run and i couldn 't move .
and i was tired and i wanted to be a good mom .
what the hell's wrong with me?
hello?
what am i doing?
darcy?
how did you know it was me?
i didn't say anything .
i , uh , just sensed it .
shit .
i'm such an idiot .
i didn't think he'd be there .
excuse me?
i didn't mean to really call you .
i had your number here , and i was thinking of you .
thinking of calling you .
obviously , i did call you .
oh , no , that's all right .
i , uh
i was thinking about you too .
well , here's to another great idea .
what , " let's meet for a drink "?
yes .
yeah?
exactly what i wanted to say .
sometimes i think you're a bit of a mind reader .
but i don't have to be a mind reader with you .
hmm .
you always say what you think .
i know .
it's a curse .
what
are you kidding?
it's a relief an enormous relief .
do you know how rare that is to actually say what you think?
do you have any idea how rare it is for someone to actually like that?
trust me , this has not been a great thing in my life .
my ex husband didn't love me .
let's just put it that way .
he didn't love you?
did i just say that?
oh , god !
um , i meant to say " it .
he didn't love it that i spoke my mind .
if you wanna know the truth , i'm not sure he did really love me .
ooh .
there's a conversation starter .
god .
a smart person would just get so very drunk now .
how long were you married?
a little less than a year .
i've been divorced about nine months now .
we worked together .
you know that , right?
oh , yeah .
i knew that .
i heard it .
hmm .
what was that like?
it was great in the beginning .
but it changed .
it became competitive .
suddenly , the better i did , the worse we did .
the price i pay for being me .
i know that now .
no , truly .
oh .
no , no , it's true .
do you wanna know all this about me?
keep going .
well , that's why i needed to get out there on my own , as scary as it was .
i mean , not scary , but , um
well , yeah , i was kind of scared .
why?
i don't know .
i guess i wasn't sure i could do the job .
i mean , i thought i could do it , but i'm finding sloane curtis a tougher place than i thought .
i'm sorry .
i know you were up for my job .
no .
i'm sorry i'm the one that got it .
i'm i'm not .
i'm not .
i've learned a lot from you .
like what?
like what?
for starters , you really love what you do .
you really love what you do .
not as much as you do .
how can you say that?
you're so great at it .
you're so great at it .
i think dan's even wondering why he hired me .
really .
i think the bloom is definitely off the rose .
you wanna hear something really great?
yeah .
i just closed escrow on my first apartment ever .
finally , i own my own place .
what?
i wish i was a mind reader .
no .
i was just thinking ...
how men like me can get so screwed up .
i don't think there are men like you .
if we kissed , would it ruin everything?
listen to me .
i think ... you are one of the great women .
i really do .
i'm sorry .
but i just meant to say thank you .
i'm so sorry .
well , i , uh , guess i'll see you ... in , let's see , three and a half hours .
nick , may i just say ... you are an exceptionally great kisser .
no , i mean really , really great .
well , i haven't had this much fun making out since
i've never had this much fun making out .
me either .
don't let this get weird at work?
no .
we have nothing to be embarrassed about .
we made out .
you and i made out .
and if i may , it was  sexy as hell .
god .
that's just what i was about to say .
but i think i said it first , i think .
oh , no , you did .
oh .
um , well , all right , then .
oh , i'm a grown woman .
just say it .
do you want to come back to my place?
say it !
do you want to come
good night , darcy .
good night .
good night .
what am i doing?
lola .
it's okay .
okay .
here he comes .
lola?
i know i haven't heard from you .
lola , how long have you been out here?
just a few ... hours .
nick , you said that you wouldn't hurt me .
and then you slept with me , and then you didn't call me for six days .
so that , in the world of me , that's torture .
i mean , we have this totally unbelievable , life altering sex , and then you just disappear .
i mean , you you you stopped drinking coffee !
lola , i'm so sorry .
it's okay .
it's okay , because i figured out your little secret .
you did?
it's so obvious .
how else would you know the things that you know?
it wasn't obvious to anybody else .
nick , come on .
you're so sensitive .
you're so aware of my feelings .
you're so tuned in .
you talk to me like a woman , you think like a woman .
nick !
come on !
admit it .
you're totally and completely gay .
i am?
you're not?
oh !
i mean , if you're not , you gotta tell me .
based on the other night just put me out of my misery .
are you or aren't you?
say you're gay .
then i'm not nuts .
i'm not undesirable .
not rejected by another guy !
say it !
say you're gay !
admit it !
okay .
i'm gay .
how gay?
oh !
i'm as gay as it gets .
you're gonna make some guy very happy someday .
oh , from your lips .
god , i hate that i'm crying .
well , look it .
if things should ever change in that department
you'll be the first to know .
you promise?
oh , yeah , i promise .
come here .
oh , boy .
it was very nice meeting you , nick .
and you .
thanks for pep talk , yes?
you two just take care of each other .
and thanks for the yarmulke .
oh , no problem .
you wear it well , yes?
happy trails , kids .
isn't he great?
darcy !
i need to talk to you .
uh oh , look at him .
i knew it .
he is weird about it .
this is not about last night .
it's about the nike meeting .
and i honestly believe in my gut ...
that you should make the pitch .
oh , god .
i guilted you into this last night .
no , no .
it would be better if you did it .
no , no , no .
this is your baby .
you've gotta do it .
i gotta go meet and greet these folks .
i'll see you in there .
it's not my baby .
yes , it is .
i predict no one will even know i'm gone until the files start to build .
it could be days .
and then someone will finally ask ,
where's the geek in the glasses who carries all the files?
do either of you two know what the story is on this erin girl?
miss lonely hearts?
who knows?
yeah .
ooh , i know .
she's been here two years .
she tried to be a copywriter but got turned down .
so she got stuck as a messenger .
what fool turned her down?
you did , sire .
well , did i ever meet with her at least?
i don't think so .
as i recall , you told me to " blow her off .
well , i wanna meet with her now .
the kid's got something .
she's kind of funny .
this is your lucky day .
i just saw the nike group get off the elevator .
all women .
your specialty .
come on .
i'll walk you up .
i hate what i'm doing to darcy .
i hate it !
i'm gonna write her a long letter , confess everything .
you're doing darcy?
since when?
no !
i said i hate what i'm doing to darcy .
men are stupider .
it's true .
will you stop it?
they are .
" they "?
are you a woman now?
oh , i wish .
a woman wouldn't have screwed over the woman she loved .
no , they don't think that way .
and another thing .
this thing about penis envy .
yeah .
not true .
no .
they don't envy it .
half of'em don't even like it .
you know who has penis envy?
we do .
that's why we cheat and screw up and lie , because we're all obsessed with our own equipment .
you ready?
okay .
yeah .
thanks .
you don't stand in front of a mirror before a run ... and wonder what the road will think of your outfit .
you don't have to listen to its jokes and pretend they're funny .
it would not be easier to run if you dressed sexier .
the road doesn't notice if you're not wearing lipstick .
it does not care how old you are .
you do not feel uncomfortable ... because you make more money than the road .
and you can call on the road whenever you feel like it , whether it's been a day ... or even a couple of hours since your last date .
the only thing the road cares about ... is that you pay it a visit once in a while .
nike .
no games .
just sports .
he nailed it .
they hit a home run .
where do we sign?
why are you not the happiest guy in chicago right now?
you just did so great .
no , no , i didn't do so great .
we did so
no , actually , you did so great .
you .
you , me .
we did great !
will you come with me someplace?
i wanna show you something .
i have something i need to finish .
please?
please .
okay .
here you go .
come with me .
all right .
should i close my eyes or anything?
no .
so , you see those top two floors right there?
i do .
all mine .
wow .
come here .
so this is my
living room .
it's beautiful .
what are you thinking?
you've got that look you have sometimes .
yeah?
no .
i was just wondering when you get to move in .
well , they said two weeks , so
okay .
this is the dining room .
the fireplace works .
come here .
wow .
i can see elegant parties in here .
waiters with caviar ,
you in a beautiful gown .
you can see all that?
maybe you're naked and i'm the only guest , but it'd still be elegant .
okay .
so this is upstairs .
there's a second bedroom or a future office or whatever .
and this is my boudoir .
your boudoir comes with pretty decent music .
it does .
where is that coming from?
let's turn up the volume .
so , where's your bed going?
uh , right ... here .
so , if you had a bed , we'd be dancing on it .
i like it here .
i like it here too .
no .
i mean , i like it here .
oh .
believe me , we're as excited as you are .
dan?
i gotta talk to you .
yeah?
he'll be there .
bye .
i gotta talk to you too .
that was nike .
they're gonna announce to the trades that we won the account .
i gotta hand it to you .
you saved my ass .
you saved the company's ass .
actually , dan , i had very little to do with saving anybody's ass .
it's darcy you should be thanking , that's what i want to talk about .
darcy?
please .
i was there .
the girl didn't open her mouth .
look , i'm a big enough man to admit when i screw up .
i looked at the marketplace and i panicked .
nick , forgive me .
i want you to step in here .
no , no , no , no .
dan , you did the right thing when you hired her .
i mean , she is the best creative director i have ever seen , bar none .
this isn't about she's adorable .
oh , yeah , she is .
but this isn't about that?
no , no .
not like that .
no , no .
please .
look .
i've been doing a lot of listening lately .
and i've decided ...
i need to take a leave of absence .
i need to get away from here and get some perspective on things .
what are you , nuts?
what is this?
what do you mean?
this is the biggest account this company has ever landed .
do you want me to have nobody running the shop?
what are you talking about?
darcy's here .
for somebody who listens a lot , you don't hear so well .
i had a meeting with her today .
i sat her down .
we had a talk .
oh , dan !
you didn't .
tell me you didn't fire her .
she didn't even put up a fight .
oh , dan , no !
hey , she's gone , pal .
no , no .
it's not too late .
look , call her .
tell her you need her back , you made a mistake .
hire her back .
hey , calm down .
i can't do that .
why?
because i talked to the board and i told them i don't need her anymore .
oh !
they offered her a settlement .
besides , nike says they want you .
you're what they bought .
i got a delivery can i
would you come out for one second?
let me tell you something .
my job is to deliver you .
dan , nike bought an idea .
it wasn't even mine .
every good idea that they loved yesterday came from her .
and if you don't get darcy mcguire back in here , and i mean pronto , the board is gonna be paying you your settlement .
this is all about saving your ass , right?
save it .
annie , get a hold of darcy's address and number as quick as possible .
yeah , sure .
where's the girl in glasses?
erin?
i don't think she's in today .
did she call in sick?
i don't think so .
didn't show up .
oh , where does she live?
does anyone know where erin lives?
who's erin?
and then someone will finally ask ,
where's the geek in the glasses who carries all the files?
hey .
yeah .
did you get a hold of darcy?
no?
keep trying .
and when you get a hold of her , tell her to stay put .
i'm coming right over .
i just have to make a little stop on the way .
do you know where this is?
down the alley .
just down the alley .
thanks .
come on , erin .
be there .
please
erin?
hello?
no , no .
dear mom
mr. marshall !
mr. marshall?
yes , erin .
yes , it's me .
i'm sorry .
i really did not mean to scare you .
okay?
i just wanted to come and see how you are .
how are you?
mr. marshall , if you're here because i didn't show up today , i'm sorry .
i was just about to call .
i swear .
no , i'm not here because you didn't show up for work .
but i'm here well , i
i bet you're wondering why i am here , huh?
as a matter of fact , i was just thinking that .
i was thinking , " why is mr. marshall here in my bedroom?
you were ... thinking that just now?
yeah , in my head .
i must have water in my ears or something .
but you're , you know , not thinking anything now , are you?
i'm thinking a million things .
really?
because , you know , usually i can , uh
i can , uh
you are thinking something right this minute?
mr. marshall , i am thinking that you are crazier than i am .
i think
i think i lost
it's gone .
i'm back .
i'm back .
mr. marshall?
yeah?
i'm sorry .
is there something i can maybe do for you?
no .
no , erin , uh
actually , i came here to see if i could do something for you .
for me?
yeah .
see , the truth is
the truth
erin , the truth is ,
i'm glad i got here before you did anything to hurt yourself .
what makes you think that i would , uh , do something to hurt myself?
i just sensed it .
really?
you could sense that?
well , that's not that's not good .
yeah .
but the real reason i'm here is because
well , here's the thing .
the real reason i'm here is because

alex called me three times from a pay phone really upset .
then we got disconnected .
what's the matter?

the prom .
excuse me .
do you know where alex marshall is?
little tenth grader?
brown hair?
about this high?
i saw her in the ladies 'room .
she's been there for , like , an hour .
alex , are you in here?
alex , it's me .
what are you doing here?
oh , honey , i just
you know , i can't believe that i screwed up .
i wasn't there when you left for the prom .

oh , boy , i feel awful .
are you okay?
i mean , i
come on out .
let me see how you look , at least .
come on .
i look like crap !
i already took my hair out and everything .
so , you know , what happened?
well , if i told you , you'd just freak out , so
what have you got to lose?
try me .
okay .
cameron and his friends , they had this big plan .
they rented this hotelroom and and
it was like a suite .
basically , i promised him that i was gonna
i can't believe i'm gonna say this to you .
i promised him that i was gonna ... sleep with him after the prom .
and like an hour ago , we were on the dance floor and i said ,
i'm sorry , cameron .
you know , i'm just not ready .
good .
good girl .
dad , come on !
i'm sorry , i'm sorry .
go on .
then he goes , " well , the limo , the room and the tux , it all cost me 400 bucks .
and i said , " i'm sorry .
i'm just not
and he cuts me off and he says ,
i never should've asked a sophomore to the prom .
what a waste .
then two seconds later , he goes and meets up with his old girlfriend ... and starts making out with her .
i mean , this disgusting slut with a tongue ring .
and then they were laughing and
i just can't go out there ever .
oh , honey , i'm so proud of you .
dad !
what are you doing?
i'm sorry .
i'm i'm sorry .
but i am .
and believe it or not ,
i know what it's like to be a woman .
i mean , it's not as easy as it looks .
you stood up for yourself .
you know how ahead of the game you are?
anyway , a guy that treats you like that and talks to you like that ,
he's not  worth my time .
yes , i know .
it's true .
he's not .
he's a gameplayer , i hate that .
you are so much smarter than me .
and look at you .
that clown made out with a girl with a tongue ring over you?
honey ... you look beautiful .
thanks .
take me home , dad .
what am i doing?
she's not in the refrigerator .
i wonder if it's too late to go over there .
no , it's not too late .
it's never too late to do the right thing .
that's what i'll do .
i'll go over there and i'll do the right thing .
hello?
uh , hi , it's me .
oh , i'm glad i found you .
uh
can i come up?
darcy?
i need to
hey .
you need to what?
it's 1 : 00 in the morning .
i need to talk to you .
okay .
thanks .
so , you sleep here now?
i thought i might as well give it a try before i have to sell the place .
sell it?
you're not selling the place .
can't afford to keep it .
i don't have a job .
you know , you ought to try returning some of your phone calls .
you got your job back .
oh , do i?
you're a riot .
you know that?
it's true .
dan told me so himself .
why would he tell you that?
i didn't do the job he hired me to do .
even i don't blame him for firing me .
look , i'm , uh you can come on in .
i don't have any chairs , but if you wanna
what if i told you that ... you did everything that you were hired to do everything but that someone was sabotaging you?
picking your brain , swiping your ideas and
well , you you never even knew what hit you .
how is that possible?
oh , trust me , it's possible .
well , who would do such an awful thing?
i would .
i was a dope with a corner office .
and when you came with the job i was supposed to have ,
i mean , it didn't matter to me that ... you were better at it than me or you earned it more than i did .
as far as i was concerned , it was mine , and i was gonna get it back .
so i took advantage of you in the worst possible way .
have you ever done that?
taken the wrong road and no , of course you haven't .
you wouldn't do that .
that's just
somebody like me does that .
and , uh
the problem with that was that while i was digging the hole under you ...
i found out all about you .
and the more i found out ... the more you dazzled me .
i mean , shook my world , changed my life , dazzled me .
and guys like that ex husband of yours , he made you feel that ... the price you pay just for being you ... is that you don't get to have love .
isn't that what you were trying to say the other night?
that you weren't complete?
that you weren't really a winner?
everything about you how smart you are , how good you are everything just makes me want you even more .
oh , wow .
boy .
so it looks like i'm here at 1 : 00 in the morning ... being all heroic trying to rescue you , but the truth is ...
i'm the one that needs to be rescued here .
i sure wish i could read your mind .
well , i was thinking that , um , if everything you're saying is true , if i really have my job back ...
then i think you're fired .
well , i never i never really thought about it from that angle .
well , not that i don't deserve it .
i do do
i'm stuttering .
now i feel kind of , uh , embarrassed that i told you i needed to be rescued .
but that's that's fine .
that's it?
i don't want that to be it .
i don't want that to be it at all .
then don't let a little thing like me firing you stand in your way .
i didn't know what to react to first .
hey , news flash .
i took the wrong road .
what kind of knight in shining armor would i be ... if the man i love needs rescuing ... and i just let him walk out my door?
my hero .
