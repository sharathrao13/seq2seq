carl's jr . has this $6 burger , which really only costs $3 . 95 ... ... so you think you're getting some deal ... ... but the truth is , it may be the best franchise burger out there . i went there yesterday and ordered three .
by golly , those suckers almost filled me up .
when i got home , i still had to have a box of eggos ... ... but that doesn't take away from carl's achievement . i mean , here's a guy who's got to go through life as carl junior , right?
like he can never get out of the shadow of his dad , the original carl , i guess .
do you think this eating has to do with thinking you killed your mother?
that you're eating yourself to death as punishment?
you do think you killed her , right? i never said that .
she called out to you from that big , fancy oak bed .
she said she was having chest pain . i never told you any of that !
how could you know this?
she begged you to dial 911 .
but she was always calling out for you , wasn't she , barry?
you weren't there .
how could you know what happened?
how?
doesn't matter .
what matters is , you've got to stop blaming yourself . if you don't , you'll eat yourself into an early grave for no reason .
you're looking in my head !
stop it !
don't look in there .
you don't have to do it , barry .
leave me alone !
it wasn't your fault .
jonesy?
hey , how are you doing , henry?
what's that you say?
are you going deaf?
how are you doing?
you know .
ssdd .
well , yeah , of course .
hey , you know , i was thinking if you were free this weekend we might go see duddits .
yeah , absolutely .
he's been on my mind a lot too . it's been a long time .
it's open !
i gotta go . i got a thing here . i'll see you saturday .
yeah , right .
see you saturday .
so , mr. defuniak ... ... do you know we're both escapees from maine?
you're from pittsfield .
do you know what happens to scholarship students caught cheating on exams?
you had the flu that day , didn't you , david?
you didn't take the exam?
you missed the test .
and since you were ill , why not write me an essay instead?
3000 words on the short term results of the norman conquest .
go get started .
yes , sir .
better to be from pittsfield than go back to it .
thank you , sir .
how did you know?
you weren't even there that day .
sometimes i just know .
hello .
this probably won't work .
never start that way with a car salesman .
we love challenges .
pete moore . in one hour i'm showing a house in fryeburg . it's a big commission .
and i just lost my damn car keys .
could you possibly make me duplicates?
that takes at least a day .
oh , boy , i just knew it !
easy , trish .
maybe i can help . i'm always good at finding things .
did i tell you my name? i don't remember  i guessed .
now , let's find those keys .
hey , rachel .
hey , pete .
miss , i looked again . i couldn't find them .
okay . i need your help .
you had the coffee in your hand , bought aspirin ... ... went to your car , realized the keys were gone .
that everything?
yes .
look .
this is gonna seem weird , but it's just a thing i do to help me think .
you bought a candy bar before the aspirin .
mars bar .
yours , right?
one more question . lf i find your keys , will you let me buy you dinner?
west wharf?
6 : 30?
best fried clams in the state? it's right on your way back .
sure .
okay .
that'd be nice .
all right .
so you got here .
you opened your purse .
coffee , candy and aspirin , you're juggling it all around .
and that's when ...
... you dropped your keys .
it's just luck , is all .
thank you .
west wharf , right?
half past six?
you got it .
another fuckarow .
jones .
how are you doing?
hey , beaver .
same shit , different day .
same shit , different day .
wanna talk?
no , you're trying to get home .
what's up?
really , i got nothing .
go home .
wait , jonesy?
yeah , beav?
you be careful .
be careful of what?
wish i knew .
what did you say?
i didn't say anything .
right .
sorry .
somebody call an ambulance ! it won't do any good . i looked away for one second .
then i heard a thump .
what happened?
oh , my god !
professor jones ! i just saw him .
he can't die !
clear !
no good .
flatline .
hit it again !
clear !
what do you think? i think it's no good . i think he's gone .
watch out for ister gay .
jonesy , don't try to lift that stuff .
just go up to the cabin .
i'll get that .
here , here , look .
big jacket .
beaver , i'm going in !
all right , i'll see you in a second !
watch the beer .
got blown last night .
good for you .
first time?
bite my bag .
met some lady at bingo , went back to her place , turned into a nice fuckaree .
as opposed to a fuckarow .
obviously .
though i've had perfectly good fuckarees turn into fuckarows in a flash .
try viagra .
viagra? i'm practically at full salute all day . i'm ....
what do you call it?
privatic?
prag prasmatic?
henry will know .
you're thinking of fourth grade .
you're having wood problems?
you haven't tried it , have you?
hell , no !
drop that little blue bomb , you're hard as a louisville slugger for 12 hours .
twelve hours? i'm talking yastrzemski .
you don't have to need it to love it .
bingo?
did you say bingo , like the game in church basements?
there's trim there .
beaver ! i thought my deal was pathetic .
you just watch .
that's your job . i'm fine .
h , you been thinking about duddits more than usual?
remember we were gonna go see him that weekend? i remember .
then i got hit .
i gotta tell you something weird .
the night i got hit , i was standing there and across the street , i saw duddits .
just like he was that day we first saw him back in derry .
he was calling out for help and everyone was ignoring him .
then he looked over at me .
he looked directly at me .
and he motioned for me to come to him .
you believe i saw him , don't you?
yes , sir , i do .
duddits loves me , i know that .
he loves us all .
he would die before he'd ever hurt us .
so why was he calling me into the street to get hit?
maybe there's more to the story we don't get yet .
you don't know shit .
name it ! i'll name it after we come up with a small wager .
50 bucks .
what's the subject? in the movies , when people wake up together ... ... they immediately start kissing and going at it .
but they never get up first , take a leak and brush their goddamn teeth .
which is pretty much necessary when you wake up .
what's it called when you got a constant woody?
you mean priapism .
see?
i'm practically priasmic .
priapismic .
whatever ! it's hard .
that's what you're betting on?
no , i can name the one movie where they acknowledge the scuzzy facts of life . i'll give you a quarter .
a quarter from you .
50 bucks from you .
promised land .
promised land?
never heard of it .
meg ryan and what's his name?
reefer sutherland .
kiefer .
from , i don't know , 1988 or something?
so meg ryan wakes up in the morning and says , " where's the cat?
and he says , " what cat? " and she says , " the cat that shit in my mouth .
that will be 50 small .
bullshit !
you made it up .
could beaver make that up?
you can have that priceless piece of cinematic trivia absolutely free . i'm filing that in the " who gives a shit " section of my memory warehouse .
what's the memory warehouse?
you don't remember? i must've forgot .
you forgot?
just remind me .
don't give me shit . it's in his head .
we've all got one .
hasn't that place been condemned?
not yet . it's so crowded i have to throw something out every time i learn something new .
when i got my new laptop i had to throw out all my files of rock 'n 'roll lyrics .
my warehouse was washed away in a flood about 10 years ago . i didn't know they had enough beer in maine for a flood .
jonesy , if that really is your name ... ... what do you do with the discarded files? i burn them .
you threw away the lyrics to " blue bayou "?
no .
no , if i really can't let go of something ... ... i sneak it back to an office where i keep my secret stuff .
where do you keep the stuff on duddits?
he's got a special section all his own on the third level . i can't stop thinking about the duds lately .
how about you guys? it's this place .
he's all around here , even though he's never been here .
this is our 20th year coming out here to hole in the wall .
and fuck me , freddy , here's to 20 more .
twenty more .
here's to duddits ... ... our dreamcatcher .
wish he was here .
to the duds .
to douglas cavell .
to duddits .
why is tina schlossinger's pussy on the wall of tracker brothers?
because i said so . it's a picture .
have you seen it?
no ... ... but the kid who sits behind me in shop , he saw it .
tracker brothers is deserted .
you don't want to see the homecoming queen's pussy?
don't come .
fuck me , freddy !
some kid's shirt .
so? it's new !
scooby doo . " i belong to douglas cavell . " " if the boy i belong to is lost , please bring him to 19 maple lane , derry , maine .

come on .
eat it .
eat it .
eat it and you can go .
hey , you guys !

you're trying to make him eat that?
what's wrong with you?
got it . i'll make him eat this dog turd , then he can go .

unless you want half .
take a hike , girls , while you have the chance .
piss off .
that's your final warning .
you better watch it !
why is that? i know who you are . i'm trembling with fear .
you're richie grenadeau , the quarterback !
so?
what will people say when we tell them what we caught you doing?
you won't tell anybody anything because you'll be dead .
get ready , pete .
give the word , henry .
pete can fly .
when you come for us , all we have to do is get in your way . i can't catch that little dick?
you know who that is?
that's pete moore .
that's right , fat ass .
pete moore .
no one can catch him .
he's going straight to his house to tell his mother .
she'll call the cops and then we'll see .
you know him , is that it?
never saw him .
then why ask for trouble? i mean , look at this moron !
he likes this attention .
how do you know what he likes?
come on , you dickweeds !
you want to fight us?
yes !
yes ! i'm gone , henry .
just say the word .
why?
you'll lose !
why?
because you can't do that ! it's wrong !
and i'm gonna tell the world !
tell everybody !
you want us to leave , is that it?
no !
let's kick their asses !
let's go .
we'll get him later .
you know that .
get you all later .
it's okay .
you can stop now .
do something .
somebody !
lf i do ... ... and you tell anybody , i'll never hang with you guys again .
i never knew beav could sing .
beaver , that's beautiful . i mean it .
not one word .
eaver !
you've got a fan .
this yours?
douglas cavell .
that's your name , right?
i duddits .

duddits?
duddits .
duddits , we got to get you home .
hey , guys !
come here !
leave the kid there .
stand right here , duddits .

jesus christ bananas !
no way is that tina jean schlossinger .
maybe her grandmother .
good going , beav .
holy god .
we came all the way here just for that?
no .
we came for him .
hey , pete .
you forgot the dogs .
weather moving in .
double storm .
alberta clipper first , maybe eight inches ... ... with a nor'easter on its tail .
get on back to the cabin , henry .
heading straight there , mr. g.
don't mess around .
no , sir .
easy , fella .
easy .
you're okay .
you're all right .
thank god .
thank god .
gee , thank god ! i'm lost . i've been lost in the woods since yesterday .
let's get you inside .
get you warm .
how would that be?
sure .
here , let me get that .
rick mccarthy .
gary jones .
but it's jonesy to everybody .
our damn cell phones are on the blink now , so i can't call for help ... ... but our car will be back soon . i didn't think i'd make it . i lost the folks i was with .
you saved me , that's for sure .
what's that?
it's a dreamcatcher .
lndian charm .
catches nightmares ... ... keeps them away .
keeps you safe down here . i've had enough nightmares .
been doing that all night .
i ate some berries in the dark .
i think they must have upset me .
i know what you're thinking .
anyone who drinks at 11 a . m . needs to take the cure , but i only do it here . in the real world , i never drink till after 5 : 00 ... ... and if it ever does , i'm on the wagon for life .
glad to hear it .
what's the matter with you?
about six months ago , the day jonesy got hit ... ... i did something terrible with a patient .
humiliated him .
drove him out of the office .
barry neiman .
couple days ago , i saw his picture in the paper .
he ate himself to death .
mind if i don't use that story next time i'm trying to sell a mustang?
henry , you were a lead balloon long before this porker munched his way to eternity .
thanks .
you're a real comfort .
you got a real delicate touch to you .
here you go , rick , buddy .
that will fix you up .
jesus christ bananas !
some fuckarow this is turning into !
thanks a lot , pete .
yeah , i think i got it all .
what happened to you?
hi .
joe clarendon .
call me beaver .
rick here had a bad night in the woods .
welcome . is that frostbite?
no , i get the same thing from peanuts . it's allergy .
grilled cheese , anyone?
no , the soup's fine for me , thanks . i'll bite .
sail it over here .
my mother used to feed me pea soup when i was feeling
bitch in a buzz saw ! i've heard some mighty burps in my time , but that's the blue ribbon . i am so embarrassed .
rick ate some berries in the woods .
oh , my god !
oh , my god , that's awful ! i'm so sorry !
rick , buddy , don't worry about it .
there's more room out than in , anyway .
what have you been eating , woodchuck turds?
know what i think? i think you need to lie down and take you a little nap .
you know , i bet you're right . i'm just tired , that's all .
come on .
my hat .
beaver?
in here .
thank you for taking me in .
thank you both .
shit , anybody would have .
maybe .
maybe not .
all right , this is in case you have to urk ... ... if you can't get to the bathroom , which is the third door to your left . if you go in the first , you'll take a shit in the closet . if you need anything , we're outside .
fuck me , give me some air !
we got any gas masks handy?
we need a biohazard team in here .
wanna hear what will freak you out more?
not really .
you know his huge stomach?
when he got here , his stomach was normal , but his chest was out to here ! i wish henry was here .
he's a shrink , not an internist .
he went to med school .
did you?
i thought about it .
you better get a run at it .
shit !
watch it !
what the hell?
pete , are you okay?
no , i broke my leg !
man , my damn leg !

hang on , pete .
hang on .
okay .
here comes the seat belt . i just opened that beer .

how's your leg?
well , it ain't broken . it's just locked up , is all .
you don't suppose he got exposed to radiation? i saw that once in a movie .
guy ended up bald as telly what's his fuck .
this guy's got plenty of hair .
but that red mark got bigger while i was watching it .
what are you doing?
peanut butter calms me down .
somebody else might want to use that jar . i'll leave some .
beav .
beaver .
criminettlies !
i think it's a woman .
i ought to warn you . i'm gonna strangle this broad . i'd guess she's already dead . i'll strangle her anyway .
she almost got us both killed .
hello !
here we come , ma'am .
don't be startled .
hello?
forget it , h. she's gone .
hello !
ma'am , can you hear me?
are you okay?
can you hear me?
i wonder if maybe that's how they say hello around here .
listen , miss road kill , you almost got us dead .
say something .
i have to find rick .
okay .
rick .
yeah .
fuck me , freddy .
what's all that red stuff on their fur?
just like mccarthy's cheek . i never saw anything like this before .
even the bears look scared .
of what?
where are they going?
it's not where that worries me ... ... it's what are they running away from?
what the hell?
this could be perfect .
they can get stinky to a hospital .
hey , you guys !
we need some help !
got a sick guy inside !
this area is under temporary quarantine .
stay where you are .
what quarantine?
we got a sick guy down here !
we need your help here !
we got a real sick guy here !
take him with you now !
glad you're okay .
this situation will be resolved in 24 to 48 hours .
kiss my bender !
i gotta ask you , old buddy .
because i'm confused . is this ssdd or not?
definitely not .
different shit today , pete .
and a pretty weird day so far , if you want to know .
over here .
there you go .
easy .
it's nine miles to hole in the wall . i think i can manage it .
i'll bring the snowmobile back and get you both .
now , pete , you listen to me .
don't go back to the car for beer .
stay with her .
keep her warm .
right hand to god , dr. d.
henry ! if we die before you get back ... ... promise you'll tell everybody she wasn't my date .
i'm telling you , jonesy , i don't like this at all .
this is turning into a double fuckarow .
a real jobba nobba .
rick , you okay? i'm a little sick , fellas . i just need to make a little room .
mccarthy , rick , open up , man .
go away !
open the door or we break it down .
can't a man have some privacy?
rick , where are you bleeding from?
bleeding? i'm not bleeding .
let's do it . i'm not positive i wanna go in there .
what if he's dying?
scooby dooby doo , we got some work to do now .
on three .
ready?
one ....

hold it !
what if we just bounce off?
no bounce , no play .
right .
no bounce , no play .
one ....
and a two ....
three !
oh , fuck !
oh , man !
fuck ! i don't want to see this ! i can't see this .
shut up a minute .
mr. mccarthy?
rick? is he still alive? i don't know .
rick?
rick , are you?
oh , man !
jonesy , if he can still do that , he must be alive .
can you hear me? i think he's dead .
bullshit !
he dropped a clinker ! i heard it . i don't think that was a clinker .
that's enough , snap out of it !
oh , my god !
my god !
no !
no?
good move ! it's trapped .
got nowhere to go but the septic tank .
oh , shit !
listen , beaver , we're gonna change places .
what?
one of us is gonna go to the shed .
no way !
shut up and listen !
there's friction tape there .
you go get it , come back .
we'll tape the lid down .
then we're gonna get the hell out of here !
you get the tape , jonesy .
don't be brave , beav .
you're faster than me . i'll sit on thumper .
no , if it does get out , you can't fight it .
not with your hip .
oh , my god !
goddamn it !
go !
and beav?
yeah?
sit tight , buddy .
okay .
all right .
okay .
shit !
earth to jonesy !
come in , jonesy !
jonesy .
jonesy .
calm down now .
okay .
okay .
okay , here it is .
okay .
find the damn tape !
where is it?
coming , beav !
beaver !
beav ! i got the what the
jonesy , get out of here !
beaver .
get out !
shut the door !
no .
run , jonesy .
you killed him .
you killed beaver .
you killed him , you fuck !
what do you want?
the men call the red stuff ripley , after the broad in the alien movies .
we eradicate the animals as they flee the blue zone .
and the populace?
we're bringing civilians to gosselin's .
we'll detain them till we figure this out .
and owen?
this time the ets belong to you .
that's right , bucko .
you'll be blue boy leader .
finally .
how many left?
about a hundred .
yeah .
not nearly enough for a serious incursion .
my guess is , it's a crash landing .
they've never picked terrain like this before .
or cold weather .
what's your call?
the biggest threat is them getting out of our net .
crash landing or not ... ... they'll try to get out and spread the infection .
i always say they never visited a world they wouldn't rather own .
they're up to their old tricks .
using a standard grayboy look ... ... with the innocent doggy eyes and smooth baby butt skin .
they project what they think we want to see .
but i've had a look at the real thing .
you wouldn't want it marrying your sister .
difference of opinion about the ripley .
really?
who has an opinion?
who do you think?
general matheson .
three star general matheson .
three?
when did you see him?
they called me in yesterday .
what's the opinion of those enlightened cocksuckers ... ... who've never been near an et?
they say the fungus doesn't take hold in all victims .
some of them get over it .
really?
and what about the shit weasels?
the ones blasting out the basement door?
does matheson think folks get over one of those puppies?
their theory is , they'll only grow in a small percentage of the exposed population .
do you like that theory , bucko?
i think it's crap .
so if you thought someone had been exposed ...
... and you had them in your grasp  i wouldn't want them walking out ...
... to wander as they wish .
bucko , i think we're on the same page .
pissing in the same latrine . if the ripley gets out of this pine tree paradise ....
well , it just can't be allowed to do that .
i've quarantined the entire area .
nothing leaves alive .
roger that , boss .
come !
got maples here , boss .
corporal maples , sir . i mean , boss . i know who you are , maples . i handpicked every man in blue boy group .
sometimes i wonder about my judgment .
yes , sir . i'm sorry , boss .
do you know the blue unit catechism?
yes , the b. u. c. for all buckos . is blue unit part of regular army?
no , boss .
better .
how does blue unit operate?
under the radar .
we do not salute , display rank , say " sir . " a force unto ourselves .
regular army compared to blue unit?
pussies .
under what rules does blue unit operate?
rules of combat .
that's right , laddie .
when a soldier disobeys a superior's orders , he puts everyone at risk .
and is to be punished immediately by appropriate command personnel .
that's me .
capisce?
good .
now answer me one question and you can boogie out of here .
but you have to answer honestly .
you were on containment detail at 0600 this morning , sector 14 of blue zone .
did you allow a young woman and her 4 year old daughter ... ... to exit the zone in their own vehicle on hickam valley road?
colonel curtis , she hadn't been in the zone .
she made a wrong turn .
she couldn't have been contaminated .
you know this for a fact?
or because she told you so?
for a fact , boss .
scout's honor?
can you raise your hand and tell me honestly that you know this for a fact?
then do it , maples .
swear on it .
scout's honor .
scout's honor .
stop your blatting , laddie buck !
you just avoided a court martial , boy .
you lie to me again , you'll be facing a firing squad .
get him out before i change my mind .
let's get him out of here .
sentry !
jesus , abe . i warned him .
could have gotten off with a slap on the wrist . instead of taking his whole hand?
he crossed the curtis line !
he came into my house , told me lies .
you think i'm crazy , owen?
a little .
i lost my temper there .
but that little worm did something worse .
the pretty mom he let pass this morning?
she's down at the barn right now crawling with the ripley .
twenty five years , owen .
twenty five years i've been going out to fight these alien bastards ... ... show them they picked the wrong place , knocked on the wrong fucking door .
and frankly , laddie , the tank is running a little low .
luckily for me , there's one bit of good news in this blizzard of bullshit . i have you .
to lead the assault today and to take over for me tomorrow .
what are you talking about , abe? it's my last dance , owen .
from now on , you will lead the band .
you know where i got that?
john wayne .
that's right .
he gave it to me .
and now i'm giving it to you .
abe , i don't know how to ....
let's not get all girlie with each other .
just tell me how we do it .
we go in fast and hard .
how do we come out?
clean ... ... and smiling .
honey , i'm home .
that's a good idea .
catch a little shuteye .
save your energy for those horrendous farts !
well , it's very nice of you to say so . i find you very attractive also .
you're one of those rare women who can handle the full size ford expedition .
the truck that handles like a luxury car .
a really big luxury car .
but seriously , folks , there is one issue i'd like to bring up ... ... just in case i should , you know , kick the bucket out here ... ... turn into a goddamn petesicle .
not that i think that's inevitable . i'm sure henry or jonesy or beaver will be coming to get us soon .
they're my friends .
we're all best friends .
now , ma'am , i'll be very candid with you about this ... ... so please , don't get freaked out or think that i'm some kind of weirdo ... ... who you shouldn't meet for the best fried clams in maine .
just some innocent fried clams at the west wharf !
you see , the four of us , best friends ... ... we all have this other friend by the name of duddits .
and our friend duddits , well , he's not your average old buddy .
one day , a long time ago , he gave us all this kind of gift . it's this ....
how shall i put it?
this ability .
this ability to know things ... ... to talk to each other without talking at all , just mind to mind .
do you see what i'm getting at?
i knew you would .
lately , i've been having this dream ... ... and in the dream , i understand how duddits could give us a gift like that .
i think maybe our friend duds is not from this planet . i think duddits is from somewhere else ... ... and he came here to prepare us for something .
it's crazy .
talking shit about the only perfect person i ever knew .
he's so goddamned good . i can't believe he's a human .
i should be singing his praises , not questioning what galaxy he's i gotta pee .
that's what i should be doing .
here's to you , duds .
the highest civilian decoration .
lord , i will never drink again .
let me get this straight .
yesterday you want to call it quits , throw in the towel , pull the plug , curtains .
today , you're begging , praying .
couple more hours .
couple more miles .
make up your mind .
jonesy !
way to go , motherfucker !
here you come to save the day !
what the hell?
who's mr. gray?
what are you trying to tell me , jonesy?
you're not jonesy .
what was that , mr. jones?
what did we just pass on the road?
are you speaking to me?
yes , i am , mr. jones .
or is it jonesy?
that's what your friends call you , isn't it?
let's be friends .
why are you letting me live? i'm borrowing you .
we're going to take a little journey .
beaver never hurt a soul and you killed him .
he had nothing in his head . i've found something useful in yours .
fuck you ! i know what that expression means . i've studied the foul language section of your memory warehouse .
rather distasteful , i must say .
how about this , mr. gray?
eat shit and die .
why did you call me mr. gray?
watch out for ister gay .
someone told you about me .
who told you about me? if you want to know , why don't you read my mind?
surprisingly , you're able to keep things from me ... ... i don't understand it .
but i'm sure i'll figure it out soon .
oh , pete , jesus !
motherfucker tried to bite my dick off , jonesy . i always thought it would be my ex wife did that .
let's get you to some help .
can you still see the line , buddy? i don't need the line to get to gosselin's .
no , i know that , but ... ... if we didn't want to go to gosselin's , how would you get us out to 95?
95?
who gives a shit? i'm hurting here , jonesy .
what's wrong with you?
wait a minute , you're not  shut up , pete .
you're too messed up to know what you're saying .
too late for that .
pete , i need you to get onto the snowmobile right now .
who the fuck are you?
you sound like one of those james bonds !
this has to do with the fucking eel , doesn't it?
you're not
stop it ! i'll get him to help .
pete , tell him what he wants to know .
now , pete , which way to i 95? i need to go to massachusetts .
my , my .
that is a gift .
who taught you that?
you're gonna be a big help , pete .
climb aboard .
show's over out there , buddy .
let me in .
let me in .
what have you got in that part of your mind , professor?
your memories are out here in the warehouse , aren't they? i want to know who warned you about me .
and who taught pete that nifty trick? i'm sure the answers are here . it'll just take me a while to find them .
to find them .
think about letting me in . it's the polite thing to do .
polite thing to do .
beav !
what is this?
beav .
shit !
fuck me , freddy .
asshole !
so long , beav .
love you , man .
we all made them in art . i finished first , so i made one for you , duds .

yes . i duddits . i duddits !
i duddits !
duds will find her .
how?
he can do anything .
she's from the retard academy .
she always waves .
we've gotta save this girl .
save this world?
not the world , duds .
a girl .
we'll save the world some other time . ister gay?
yeah , it's a mystery .
we need you to solve it .
dreamcatcher .
duds'll read our minds .
not this again .
shut up .
we gotta think of josie .
josie , josie , josie .
josie rinkenhauer .
josie?
that's right .
can you find josie?
this is completely crazy .
you can say that again . i didn't say anything .
you did . i heard you .
you said , " this is completely crazy . " i didn't say that . i thought it .
kiss my bender .
duds can hear people's thoughts .
we can't .
are you sure of that , beav?
hey , guys !
she's down here for sure !
josie , you down there?
josie !
josie !

blue boy leader .
how we doing , bucko?
right here , boss .
fast and hard .
wouldn't have it any other way , blue boy .
sir?
i see it .
don't hurt us .
we're dying .
there is no infection here .
whose radio is that? it's not the radio .
they're putting it into our heads .
we are helpless .
there it is , gentlemen .
there's no infection here .
directly into our heads .
this gives you an idea what we're up against .
if anybody's thinking , " those poor , helpless little folk ... ... all naked and unarmed beside their crashed intergalactic winnebago ... ... what kind of a dog , what kind of a monster ... ... could hear that heartbreak and go in just the same?
well , i'm that dog . i'm that monster .
we are helpless .
we are dying .
these mothers are as harmless as a fox in a henhouse .
and i'm here to kick some ass !
are you with me?
yes , boss !
roger that , boss .
right on , boss .
don't hurt us .
i have a visual .
holy shit !
damn , look at the size of that .
blue boy group , this is blue boy leader .
target imminent .
move to level 4 readiness .
gentlemen , lock and load .
hellfires are hot .
sing it out , owen !
blue boy group , this is blue boy leader .
clean up the forest and get rid of this trash !
don't hurt us .
please , don't hurt us .
there is no infection here .
we are helpless .
fire at will !
fire !
owen , get them out of there !
it's gonna blow !
blue boy group , withdraw at once . i repeat , cease firing and back off !
we can get them ! it's self destructing .
back off !
blue boy group , get out of there !
we're on top of it !
owen , pull out now !
pull out !
get out of there !
pull out !
jonesy , i've been thinking about our friend .
our scooby doo buddy .
for a long time i thought he was sent to us to warn us about something . i could never figure what it was .
don't talk about him .
not till today . it was this , right now .
he wanted to warn us .
go ahead , pete .
tell me about your friend .
did he show you that nifty trick?
no .
jonesy's right .
come on , pete .
let's talk .
bite my bag , motherfucker !
all right , pete , i'll bite .
your bag and everything else .
no , no !
you bastard !
no !
pete .
don't talk to him !
get out of there !
what's up?
thank god you came by , governor . i'm broke down here and fearing for my life .
that's a good looking dog .
where you headed?
gosselin's .
any chance you're going near there?
that's where i'm going .
well , i believe your tailgate has come open .
let's take a look .
i see you have some cargo you're taking to blue base .
got a treat for you , ike .
all you can eat .
eat all the red stuff .
good doggy .
yes .
good boy .
have your fill .
tasty , tasty .
eat all you want
jonesy .
what are you up to?
jonesy !
oh , god !
halt or we'll fire !
you cannot leave the quarantine zone !
halt ! i think i just about halted here .
come with me , owen . i'll show you things you'll wish you'd never seen .
how long we gotta be here? it'll be all right .
i demand to see my lawyer !
there must be something they can do .
don't worry , you'll be fine .
when do we get out?
within hours .
you can't do this to people in america ! i told you to stay over there !
my wife  government's doing everything they can ... ... to get you out of here .
please don't worry . it's all right .
we're doing everything to make sure you're safe .
we'll get you back to your homes within hours .
all clear .
can i help you , sir?
what's your name?
henry .
dr. henry devlin .
a doctor?
good .
we need doctors in there .
come on , laddie , i'll buy you a cup .
you , sir , where you from?
boston .
beantown?
great city .
we'll have you back there in no time .
maybe by morning .
hurry up , bucko .
you see that crud on the faces of children ... ... you know why i relish a turn in the country like we had today .
you were excellent out there , o. it made me feel very proud to
abe?
abe , you okay?
abe?
yeah , i'm fine . i'm fine . i must be getting too old for this shit .
i don't know what the hell that was about .
it's the only way , owen .
we've got to cauterize the site .
they've all got to die .
it's the only way .
but we don't know that .
the studies point to the strong possibility of recovery for many exposed subjects .
the studies show squat , that's what they show . if matheson had been in my spot for the last quarter century ... ... you'd have never made it to your first jerk off .
those gray bastards would have had you for lunch back in armpit , kentucky .
some get better .
at least half will be over it in a few days
which ones , mother teresa?
can you guarantee they won't take it home like a present for the family? i'll tell you what you should be worried about .
what should be on your mind .
not these few unfortunates .
what you should be worried about is a hitchhiker .
what?
a hitchhiker .
our greatest fear is that a grayboy would catch a ride ... ... with somebody and would carry them out of here , without being consumed .
to scatter the infection , like johnny fucking appleseed .
are you sure there isn't such a person?
no .
but i am sure that if there is one he won't get out .
not with the net my boys put up around the blue zone .
and if we do a thorough job on the ones we've got . if we don't get gooey about the little picture when our job is taking care of the big one .
capisce?
owen , if you think this is easy for me , you're crazier than my mother was .
those poor schmucks .
they drive chevrolets , shop at wal mart ... ... never miss an episode of friends .
these are americans .
the idea of slaughtering americans ... ... it just turns my stomach .
but i'll do it . i'll do it because it needs to be done .
so if we start at 2 , we can be done by 2 : 30 .
and it's all behind us .
except for the dreams .
yeah , except for them .
what are you gonna tell rita about what you did here?
what are you gonna tell katrina when she's old enough to ask?
you know me , don't you? i don't remember when we met , but you know me .
we don't have time to screw around .
you've got two problems .
one you know about , one you don't .
go ahead .
your mentor , colonel curtis , he's gone insane from hunting aliens for 25 years .
now he wants you to help him kill hundreds of innocent people .
who are you?
me?
talk about that later , once we get out of here .
you're predictable .
you won't let me burn on this fence ... ... any more than you'll help curtis kill those people .
what you're thinking now is whether that digital sat scan transmitter ... ... in your duffle bag will let you get through to somebody .
somebody named general matheson .
sometimes we have to kill , but our real job is to save lives .
your father was a great soldier .
those were his last words .
you carry his picture with you always .
tell me everything .
you'll save these people .
when we're done talking , get on the transmitter , contact matheson .
cavalry rides in .
that takes care of problem number one .
now comes the hard part .
you think the infection's been contained , that there's no hitchhiker .
you're wrong .
he's riding with my best friend on earth .
a guy named gary jones .
and he's out there .
you and i don't get after him right away , he'll get out of my range ... ... and some kind of shit is gonna hit the planetary fan .
our nightmare hitchhiker .
and all dr. mystery wants is a free pass so he can catch his friend .
very convenient . i'm saying you ought to hear his story .
okay .
where is he?
had him taken to the tractor shed .
okay . i'll check him out and we can compare notes .
whatever you say , boss .
come on , come on .
time's a wasting .
all right , lad , open up .
dr. boston?
are you in here?
i'm here .
where i've been put .
a prisoner on my own damn property .
let's go !
come on , let's go .
get in !
you almost ran me down .
figured you'd read my mind and get out of the way .
blue unit , stand down .
you are under regular army command .
put down your weapons at once .
your mission is rescinded .
this is no longer a blue unit operation .
put down your arms .
repeat , put down your arms .
general matheson has assumed command .
okay , owen .
okay .
you just drove over the curtis line .
where we going?
south .
all i know right now .
just get me in range of jonesy ... ... we'll know everything we need to know .
that's some gun .
can i have a look?
kind of flashy for a guy like you , isn't it? it's a gift . i know .
where are you , jonesy?
pick up the phone .
call 1 800 henry .
hello?
jonesy !
jesus christ , i knew it was you .
where's he taking you?
massachusetts?
he is?
duddits?
okay , i will .
you hang in there , jonesy .
jonesy?
he hung up .
give me back my gun .
we gotta go to derry .
that where they're going?
no , they're going towards massachusetts .
we need duddits .
jonesy says mr. gray is afraid of duddits .
your buddy , he's still alive after all this time with mr. gray?
yeah , he's immune . i think it's because he died .
he got hit by a car and his heart stopped .
twice . i don't think he even knows it .
he came back from the dead .
must have changed him somehow .
it's almost like duddits saw this whole thing coming . is that it?
jonesy told me it was duddits who drew him into the accident . if we catch him , we're gonna have to kill him .
you know we have to do it . it's the only way to stop mr. gray ... ... assuming we can catch him .
when was the last time you saw duddits?
long time ago .
years .
what makes you so sure he can help?
duddits can do anything . i didn't understand that then , but i think it's always been true .
he's the one who made us like this .
like what?
you know , weird .
he's been waiting for you .
blizzard slowed us up .
henny , henny .
henny .
i miss you , henny . i miss you .
henny .
long time , henny .
my god , roberta , what is it?
lymphocytic leukemia .
i'm gonna let you take him , but i have to tell you why .
just now , when he was getting ready ... ... henry he was so excited .
like he hasn't been in such a long time .
i think ... ... that if he's with you , he might die happy ... ... instead of in this awful room .
be sure the parka stays on tight .
cold devastates him .
the medication and instructions are in here .
bye , mom .
goodbye , duddie .
be a good boy .
now , go save the world .
i'm all right , laddie .
they haven't got enough courage to take my trailer .
not yet , anyway .
what've we got?
they're leaving derry , maine , heading south on 95 .
toward massachusetts .
massachusetts?
stay with it , bucko .
general matheson .
come in , please .
this is very nice , abe .
been home through some rough times .
was there something we hadn't covered? i don't think i got to say before how much i respect the work you've done . it was with sincere regret
herman may i call you herman?
we may not agree on all the strategic initiatives , but we do agree on this : i'm past it .
burned out .
just needed a push , that's all .
should have quit after that mess in montana .
even i don't trust my judgment anymore .
oh , yeah ....
my techies tell me we're getting some electronics reading hot from in here .
yes , i've been talking to the wife on my sat phone . i don't know if you've ever met barbara .
she's been after me for years to retire .
she's very happy , i can tell you that . i'll have everything shut down in an hour . if that's soon enough .
that will be fine .
how do you turn off the goddamn lights?
maybe you shouldn't have been so fast to kill that trooper .
you're making yourself at home .
you have no idea , jonesy .
maybe you shouldn't have been so fast to kill that trooper . " not bad?
oh , don't like that , gary , do you?
ownzy .
he's in a police car now .
he's in a police car now .
can you see where they are , duds?
ownzy .
he's in ister gay .
mr. gray .
that's right , duds , he is in mr. gray . " ister gay " is mr. gray .
we gotta save this girl .
save the world?
not the world , duds , a girl .
we'll save the world some other time . ister gay?
you already knew .
where's he going , duds?
where is mr. gray taking jonesy?
ister gay , he want war .
war?
not war , water .
mr. gray wants water . i know where he's going .
he's going to the quabbin reservoir .
what's quabbin? it supplies drinking water for all of boston .
what?
one worm kills the world .
one worm kills the world?
oh , my god .
one worm .
back at our cabin , i saw the worms that come out of these weasels .
mr. gray must want to get one into the boston drinking supply .
just one worm infects the whole world?
are we going right?
yes .
take the 495 to the mass pike . it's not far .
you're doing great , buddy .
now , are you ready to try something hard? i want to ask you something hard .
yes , henny .
good .
can you talk to jonesy?
can you make him hear you?
ownzy ... ... and ister gay .
duddits .
i knew it . i knew it .
he's been here all along .
waiting .
jonesy? it appears we didn't meet by accident .
we owe it to our friend , duddits . i don't know what you mean .
no?
maybe not .
maybe your clever friend didn't want you to know what he was up to .
that's why you had nothing in the warehouse about me .
duddits didn't bother to tell you what job he had in mind for you .
it doesn't matter .
his little scheme didn't work .
did it , ike?
no , no .
we're almost there .
what was it your poetry file had to say? i have promises to keep and miles to go before i sleep
and miles to go before i sleep
stop that chopper !
punch it , dude .
don't be a pussy .
thank you , gary jones .
go up around the reservoir .
aqueduct to boston starts in shaft 1 2 .
patience , bambino .
just up ahead .
stay here and take care of your friend .
no matter what you hear .
so long , doctor .
good doggy .
good girl .
shit !
you son of a bitch !
wait .
wait .
go back to car , duddie .
you'll be safer there .
look out , jonesy .
i knew you'd come , henry . i knew you wouldn't let me die .
who the fuck are you?
don't you know me , h? i don't know .
i think i'm gonna have to shoot you .
just to be sure .
well , maybe you're right , my friend . i don't know myself if mr. gray is gone .
he could be hiding in here somewhere ... ... waiting for his chance .
tell me something mr. gray couldn't possibly know .
tell me something only we would know .
ssdd .
not good enough .
well , you decide .
ask me anything .
at tracker brothers , day we met duddits ... ... what was painted on the wall by the window?
no ...
... bounce ....
no play .
hello ... ... ister gay .
you .
ooby ooby doo ... ... we got some work to do now .
ister gay ... ... go away .
no !
i duddits .
h?
jonesy .
jonesy , if that really is your name ....
that'll be 50 small .
bullshit .
i duddits . i duddits .

we're all best friends .
