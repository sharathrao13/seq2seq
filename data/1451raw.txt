ornelle , planning on pulling that thing out with that truck?
before i start , i got to get it right : who do i send the bill to?
judge executive pays the bills .
hey , darl !

she's a believer .
good grief , little feller .
you're about to get squashed !
now run .
run like the wind !
how you doing , sister?

i didn't think god would let a miss work on sunday .
i have to be open for business before the casino is .
i'm trying to identify this gal .
you haven't seen her , have you?
no , she doesn't come to my church .
i guess you wouldn't know her , would you?
say , henry?
ain't playing much football .
hell , no .
help me out with something .
have you seen this little sweetheart?
she is a looker .
yes .
she's got hit by a truck .
i heard that .
i don't know her .
your money is no good here .
my wife picked out hush puppies .

good deal .
thanks for your help .
okay , darl .

sure will .
hey , darl ... those kids out front , please run them off .
i'm getting complaints .
all right .
see you later , henry .
that's dangerous !
you little shits will have to get out of here .
you're running off all of henry's customers .
what are you just standing there for?
get in the car . what's wrong?
you come with me .
why?
because i said to .
come on .
come on , let 's just go .
your mom doesn't let you smoke .
not in front of her .
who's this?
i'm trying to find out .
so how's school , honey?
amazing . that's good .
can i get a tattoo?
a tattoo of what?
gaia . what's gaia?
gaia , the earth goddess .
when i was a kid , the girls who had a tattoo worked in tit shows .
don't walk around like trash .
thanks .
c. b. to big t one .
you copy?
we're over at the doc's .
you got to see this .
see what , c. b.?
damn , squeegee .
wait until you see this !
you ain't supposed to be in here .
you just wait .
what's going on?
she's got a pecker .
and teeties .
don't say that , c. b. jesus !
she's got a bigger dick than i do .
squeegee , i'll have to take your word on that .
oh , lord !
you call it a" transvestite " .
technically ... because of the hormone induced breasts , she's a" transsexual " .
a transvestite just likes to dress up .
an accident?
no .
this is the copper that killed her , or him .
22 caliber , shot to the back and lodged in the chest cavity .
feet are cut up , so ...
i feel she ran a long way with this in her .
the actual time of death probably just 45 minutes ago .
asphyxiation .
lungs slowly filled up with the blood .
damn , darl .
she was alive while we were unloading those shoes .
jesus as a tattoo ... but this here , that's a stamp , like you'd get in a nightclub .
homicide .
you should've called investigators before moving her .
excuse me , mrs. district attorney , i was called for the accident .
i didn't have any idea ...
wow !
that 's cool !
what?
get back in the car !
she's riding back with me .
come .
what?
i wish to hell she hadn't proposed to me .
it would've been easier .
it 's my fault you're miserable . that's what i said .
you're getting any alimony?
i should .
put her through school .
doc , won't you put some over this .
i always love this bit .
those goodies look so real .
they are real .
what do you think?
they're not exactly real .
they're weren't real .
they're real now .
they sure are pretty .
hey , cut that out .
seems you know a lot about this .
i've read a lot .
i'm sorry .
i just read a lot .
i don't know what the deal is .
we don't want to know what's going on ...
behind closed doors .
stop that .
i'm going back to the desk .
want me to call the state forensics?
why?
carla said we should've done it .
i don't give a rat 's ass .
call in the state boys on a sunday ... to investigate a" homocide "?
they don't give a shit .
have you seen my sunglasses?
no .
shit !
good morning , lana , how you doing? ls the judge home?
he's out back .
take the baby bear .
mr. grandpa bear .
he's got a tie on .
you've got your hands full .
daughter thinks i'm a babysitter .
i have done nothing to dissuade her of that notion .
we have a policy problem with darl i should let you know about .
that d. o. a.
darl doesn't want to call in the state investigation unit .
darl can be mule headed .
he should've checked with me before stealing those shoes .
i mean it's been years since darl has handled a murder case .
the first 48 hours are crucial .
some crime investigations don't deserve the tax payer's money .
this is one of them .
i beg your pardon?
having the wrong kind of publicity in le salle at the wrong time .
with the casino pendent?
i know we shot it ... but , right now , darl just might be the best man for the job .
pretty precious !
i missed you .
i was just gone for a minute and i missed you .
good grief !
darlene , this milk stinks !
there's creamer in the cupboard .
i don't like that powder shit .
this lady ...
she would like to speak to a sheriff or a deputy .
hi .
my name is darl .
pleased to meet you .
are you the sheriff?
yeah .
except i don't use my gun unless the charm fails , you know?
i'm worried about a friend of mine .
you're not from here , are you?
why do you say that?
because you look better than the people around here .
no .
i drove up from new orleans .
how's everything down there?
it 's fine .
you get down there much?
lf i got a good reason , i go down there every now and then .
yeah , i'm worried about my girlfriend .
she called me ...
saturday from le salle .
i haven't heard from her since .
this might not have anything to do with it , i don't know ... but did she happen to have a ...
a what?
it 's ...
a jesus tattoo?
where are we going?
across the street .
full name?
mona .
mona what?
she just had one name .
i felt something was wrong .
what happened?
got shot .
we found her at a swamp .
who did it?
i don't have a clue .
do you?
listen , this sex question over here is a little problem .
what box should i check?
however you like .
alright , both boxes .
next keen?
me .
are you like her sister or something like that?
i'm her wife .
legal?
legal .
i'm sorry , i just ...
i never really ...
hey !
i'm sorry , but it's strange for me .
i don't see it every day .
ma'am , this is a murder case .
i'll have to ask you some more questions , so ...
ask !
what was she , or he ...
she !
alright , what was she doing in le salle?
mona called our house on saturday night and left a message ... around 3 .
she said ... she was working in a christmas party in le salle and ...
her ride left her stranded and in the morning she would catch a bus .
sunday came and she didn't come home .
monday i started to worry .
i called everybody ...
nobody heard from her .
last night , i drove up here .
that's it .
that's all i know .
where was this party at?
i don't know .
she's an entertainer , she performs a lot of parties .
what was she driving?
doesn't have a license nor a car .
where did she call you from?
i don't know .
how about this jesus tattoo she had on her? what's that about?
a few years ago , she went through this religious phase ....
she got this tattoo .
jesus over her heart .
what about that stamp on her hand , that j. a.? what's that?
johnny angels " , a nightclub in new orleans where we work .
both of you work there?
are you the same as she is , you know?
what does that have to do with my husband being murdered?
c. b. , what do you want?
sorry , but we got an emergency .
there's a protest at the casino site and ...
your daddy's got a shotgun .
of course he has .
would you mind waiting in my office?
i got to take care of this .
get back here !
this was to a be a nice protest .
nobody invited him to show up .
you hear me?
he won't let me near him .
he's going to kill somebody .
hey , it's me !
put the gun down !
i've seen better sheriffs in saturday morning cartoons !
there he is , god himself .
mr. own it , mr. buy lt .
well , these raisins ain't for sale !
bull , you stupid drunk , put that gun down !
stay back !
he's crazy !
all bark and no bite !
flatter than yesterday's beer .
you are gone .
there's nothing left .
i'm a dangerous man .
i'm a killer !
lf you were to kill me , you'd have killed me a long time ago .
give me that gun .
get him out of my site .
come on , daddy .
get up .
get off this hill , damn it .
what are you doing shooting at things?
i don't believe it would do any good to lock him up .
do you?
how are you coming with that freak murder?
we made an l . d. she came from new orleans .
i figured .
all shit that floats ends up in new orleans .
that's for sure .
darl , i don't want you to make too much noise with that case .
i'd hate to have the newspapers stick the words le salle parish ... and transsexual murder in the same headline .
i hear you .
see if you can talk some sense into that alcohol soaked head .
all right .
that son of a bitch !
that judge's a tad wacker , that's what !
he's brought up every land this side of the lake , except mine .
and i'll fry in hell before i sell out to that son of a bitch !
no , sir , not for fort knox !
when he asked for my badge , i thought " how bad can that be "?
it 's only a piece of tin .
i didn't realize that that badge ... was my skin .
it held me together .
don't let him do that to you .
don't have to worry about me .
i don't .
your brother took the wrong turn .
took after your momma .
but you are me .
big chief to station 1 .
station 1 .
tell that scarlet person to go back to new orleans .
i'm tied up .
she's left already .
but she wasn't going back to new orleans .
she said she was going by the bus station ... see if anybody had seen her husband .
over .
all right .
i use 2 sticks of butter .
no more , or it doesn't taste right .
plus , it puts pounds on you .
i think i could use a few pounds .
sheriff?
can i help you?
how you doing?
all right .
i was looking for somebody .
she was looking for somebody too .
then we got to discussing shortbread recipes ...
sorry i couldn't help you with your friend .
i'll keep an eye out .
thank you .
sure .
who are you looking for?
i think i know where to find them .
all right .
i thought i told you to wait for me at the office ...
thought i could help .
it turns out mona never bought a bus ticket .
yeah , well ...
okay ...
that's you right there? what's your sign?
your astrological sign?
capricorn .
stubborn .
selfish and stubborn .
i'll handle everything from here .
just go back to new orleans ...
look , you think that mona belongs in a petri dish ... but you're wrong .
mona was the best person i ever met .
the gentlest person .
never put on errors , kind to everyone .
you think that's easy , the choice that she made in her life?
it isn't .
she's the bravest person i've ever met .
so , you put your prejudice aside ... and swear to me you're going to find out who did this .
okay , we'll handle that , right off the bat .
that 's what we'll do .
ho , ho , paradise casino has got to go !
i want 3 of whatever those deals are .
you look lovely .
thank you .
you bought that dress in n. y.?
new orleans , right off the rack .
you're charming .
how are you?
great , thanks .
the governor is here .
we all know about your politics .
come give us a bit of that guitar .
come on , judge .
you're going to play for us , gov?
come on and give us ...
come on up here !
come up here !
come on , governor !
play something nice !
for god's sake !
darl , where are you going?
i don't want to listen to that son of a bitch try to play the guitar .
what do you care?
c. b. , i was just being nice .
hey , hey , ho , ho , paradise casino has got to go !
hey , hey , ho , ho , paradise casino has got to go !
hey , darl !
hi !
darl , those asshole mother fuckers won't let us in their damn party .
get back in the car !
who's that you're with?
nobody .
i'm leaving .
you coming?
does it look like i'm coming?
hey , there , listen .
behave now , all right?
i always behave .
you're not doing a good job .
that 's not his daughter , is it?
there you go .
hi , everybody .
this is ...
party hardy girl .
my friend hannah .
hey , i know you from the tavern .
how you doing?
this must be the husband you're always running down .
hey , i told you to behave .
let 's hear it for the governor !
thanks .
i want to talk a couple of minutes about le salle parish .
not like my opponent , hart burnson , or as i call him ...
heartburn , son !
he's marching marionettes right outside that door .
paradise casino has got to go !
you know me?
no , i don't think so .
you tried to fuck me .
i own a picking pan in shreeport .
this is a shipping invoice .
you stole us$ 2o, ooo worth in my shoes .
i don't know anything about it .
my driver says you were there .
well , your driver ought to be a better driver , you know what?
my brother in law is the attorney general .
he'll rip you a new one .
i don't know who you think you are , but this ain't shreeport .
so you'd better keep your finger out of my face !
burnson doesn't want jobs for you .
you know what?
they're going to vote you off the ticket .
did they tell you yet?
good party , judge .
darl , how are you doing?
you're cutting me off the ticket?
where did you get that idea?
don't bullshit me .
easy , darl .
you easy !
get your fucking hands off of me !
you're embarrassing yourself .
don't fuck with me in my parish !
you need to calm down , hear me?
get your nose out of his ass !
always good to see you , darl .
you too , governor .
thanks for coming .
merry xmas .
merry christmas to all of you .
what is everybody looking at?
just enjoy yourselves .
shit !
home , sweet home .
what are you doing?
what did you do , girl?
some girls are spitters , but i'm a swallower .
i guess i'll carry you .
where are you going to take me?
where are we going?
take off my boots .
hello?
sheriff?
who is this?
scarlet .
did i wake you?
i got the number mona called from .
it 's on my new phone bill .
you got a pencil?
yeah , i got one .
okay, it's 294 367 2 .
got it?
i called there a bunch of times .
nobody ever answers .
this is kind of late .
i don't know what to do with her things .
have you ever lost anybody close?
yeah .
i'm sorry .
so , good night .
good night .
hey , carla .
listen ...
i said some pretty ugly things last night .
i made a fool out of myself .
yes , we all remember very well .
i remember pretty well .
i'm very sorry .
she's watching us , so let 's be civil with each other .
what are you doing for christmas?
drive up to your momma's?
no , because i only get a day off .
it 's too far to drive .
she won't speak to you .
at least try to do that .
yeah , i guess not .
darl , there were a lot of phone calls made about you last night .
phone calls don't scare me .
lf you heard them , you'd be .
watch your back .
let me make a deal with you : invite me over for christmas .
i'll bring a tree , a turkey and fruit cake .
we'll have a big ...
you think you can act like an ass , show up and everything be fine?
you don't get off for free .
you're a cop , you should know .
lf you want to come over in the afternoon to see ashley , fine .
there's a party in baton rouge i'm going to .
ls that right?
i bet the governor will be there .
move your car .
hey , judge .
let 's just get right to the point .
lf you're taking some heat , i'll call the governor right now .
last week i visited an elementary school and i saw this girl ... on a computer talking to kazakhstan .
i'm not smart to know where it is , but i know things are changing .
what was good enough for le salle parish 1o , 2o years ago ...
i don't have a clue what you're talking about !
not a fucking clue !
well , there it is , in a nutshell .
the party is running jackson for sheriff .
ls that right?
that 's right .
well , i'm running . lf i have to run against you and the party .
your father tried that once with very little success .
don't talk about my father , okay?
you and him both can kiss my ass !
that 's exactly it .
excuse me , it's real quick .
lucy , i need that voter petition for elective office .
all right .
thanks , honey .
sure , darl , i'll sign .
you're a good man .
i'll tell that to everybody .
always good to see you , darl .
you told all sorts of lies to get elected .
they'll all catch you " .
what do you say , goose?
i've already signed for jackson .
i understand .
sorry , darl .
keep trash of my parking lot .
you got it , henry .
i really appreciate it .
ornelle ... you're going to go blind looking at that nookie .
i'm looking for my car catalogue .
he's been looking for it for half an hour .
i need you to sign something for me . what's wrong with him?
hey , sister , are you going to sign for me?
well , what are your views about the state supporting gambling?
what does it have to do with it?
well , our governor ... who coverts with harlots on the sabbath , our sheriff steals shoes .
come to think of it , i think jackson might be the better man .
know what i'm beginning to think?
that i liked you a lot better ... when you smoked all that reefer and went fucking in your pinto .
the lord's arms are big enough to embrace all who've fallen down .
i think you'd better get with it .
so you're not going to sign it?
there were a lot of phone calls made about you last night .
watch your back .
red light usually means " stop " !
goddamnit !
you little shits stay out of the road , you understand me?
i don't think i can keep my shoes .
scarlet called 3 times .
did you know jackson is running this year?
well?
yeah , i heard .
c. b. , i gave him his job .
and you know damn well that he's going to get all the black vote .
i don't know what he said , but his deputy will come from swamp town .
c. b ...
i need you on my side .
i found your sunglasses , darl , on the back seat of my wife's car .
hello?
sheriff's office .
i've done everything you've ever asked of me ... haven't l?
darl , it's that scarlet person again .
pulled a fast one , did he?
i told you .
it was just a matter of time .
he did it , you know?
who did what?
killed that freak .
you mean the judge?
who else?
nobody squeezes a shit without his thumb prints in it .
he's running the nigger to fill your slot .
what will you do?
i didn't raise you to roll over , buddy boy .
why don't i just bitch and moan and soak myself to death?
let the record show i never missed one day at work .
not one , no sir !
go ahead , run , you son of a bitch !
come on , boy !
come on !
come here , buddy !
all right .
feeding the little doggies?
how's it going , cletus?
good .
ls it about 8 days till hunter season?
yes .
it 'll be in about 8 days .
was that dog at the wreck?
yes , sir .
that 's buster there .
he must have heard the breaks squealing .
busted loose .
hey , darl !
you look lost .
i walked in from the highway .
how are you all guys doing?
hey , sheriff , what you got there?
it 's a shoe i found in the woods .
it might belong to that freak .
i thought you weren't so interested in that case .
well , i'm getting more interested in it .
you have a party saturday?
why are you asking?
i don't know .
i guess i thought i might get invited to it .
you're not a member .
hey , sheriff ... when you catch him , you'll lock him up or give him a medal?
i don't know .
i haven't decided it yet .
good seeing you .
don't be bitten by snakes walking in the woods .
i'll try .
hey , marcus !
what are you doing in my car?
darl hardwick , move over to the car , place your hands on the roof .
i don't know what you're talking about .
for what?
taking shoes?
statutory rape .
what are you talking about?
the girl you brought to the party was fifteen .
i didn't touch her .
that 's not what she said .
i don't give a shit to what ...
darl !
let me see your gun and up with your hands .
here's my hands up .
what are you going to do?
right .
excellent .
you marginal piece of shit !
up against the car !
what are you looking at , marcus?
you're some kind of friend , huh?
i can get in the fucking car .
get in there !
hey !
hey !
it smells like shit in here !
oh , man !
here goes this up .
i'm recusing myself from the case .
we're bringing in another prosecutor .
carla , i didn't do anything to that little girl .
they must 've paid her off to lie about me .
that 's all i ...
i read her deposition .
you'll need a really good lawyer .
i'm happy to make some recommendations .
they're trying to push me out , that's all this is about .
the freak case can hurt them .
i read her birth certificate .
she was fifteen .
everybody saw you leaving with her .
she's ashley's age .
you just live in your own play pen with your own rules , don't you?
i can't shop without people looking at me like i'm pathetic .
i'm not pathetic , you're pathetic !
i married a good man ... but these last several years i've been miserable .
where did you go?
it was a set up .
i can prove it .
we dropped to a lessercharge , attributed to delinquency .
throw out the statutory rape .
and you get out on 12 months probation .
darl , i'm trying to keep you out of jail .
for a cop , it's a felony offense .
i'll piss away my law enforcement career .
i saw you serve that girl drinks .
that 's against the law .
the condition is you can't leave the parish without permission .
howdy .
need a ride?
a ride with who?
gizmo .
i play a zodiacal accordion on an anti gambling website ... and i'm a good friend of your good friend sister felicia .
this is mark , my unpaid intern .
that party at tidewater .
i heard a rumor the governor was there .
they say in louisiana politics the only way you can get reelected ... if you get caught with a dead girl or a live boy .
our governor's done the combo .
you work for burnson?
who i work for is not as important as getting out the truth .
you know the state police moved your d. o. a. to baton rouge?
records on the case were sealed .
i've been kind out of the loop .
i heard .
you possess a special gift , darl .
i'm talking about the ability to bring politicians to their knees .
i can help you get even .
i don't need any help .
it 's a rough league , bubba .
sooner or later ... at this level , everybody needs help .
can you tell me where a bar named johnny angels is?
you wouldn't know where a place called johnny angels is .
us$ 5 .
only us$ 5 .
i'll read your tarot .
so , is he dead?
no .
not officially , no .
have you come in to do a little christmas shopping?
i'm on a case .
i thought you might know where johnny angels is .
you're a little out of your jurisdiction , aren't you , sheriff?
nice place you've got , though .
this is luna , my partner .
this is darl .
my , my , the sheriff !
oh , we've heard about you .
well , i'm not a sheriff anymore .
there's a story right there .
any freak on the street can tell you where johnny angels is .
why did you come in here , darl?
well , it is christmas , you know?
so i thought i'd just come by and say ...
maybe say you're sorry?
see if you were alive .
y'all got a lot of diseases .
how considerate of you .
good to know you haven't changed a bit .
canal and belvedere street .
green door behind a warehouse .
merry christmas , darl .
yeah , merry christmas .
hey , gorgeous , look at you .
watch the nails .
what's in the bag?
it 's a shoe .
let 's see .
nice .
a stamp , like you'd get in a nightclub .
hello , cowboy .
you're my little flower
flower , flower
i remember when
you were in my hands
time falls like a shower
when i see you , flower
there's a place where grace
will take me to you
i'll breathe
through you
flower , fly
nice job , sugar .
thank you so much .
that was great , darling .
thanks .
hey , sheriff .
i'm not a sheriff anymore .
why?
they caught you with your fingers in the cookie jar?
i'm being set up for investigating the murder of your husband .
that 's funny .
i can't even get you to return my phone calls .
watch it ! what's your problem , faggot?
say you made a mistake !
relax , buddy !
listen , i'm breaking my parole to talk to you .
what do you want?
a star on your forehead?
a round of applause?
did this belong to mona?
no .
are you sure?
i'm sure .
get the fuck out of the way !
stop !
stop !
what?
i found out where the party was .
tidewater .
two years ago , a girl who worked in here was beaten to death ... with a tire iron , right here , on the side of this wall .
and the cops told me to my face that she deserved it !
lf i help you , will you go all the way with this?
this is about real justice for mona .
so that's her shoe back there?
it 's mine .
we wore the same size .
darl , could you hold my lipstick?
my pocket 's got a hole .
what's happening , little momma?
good to see you .
haven't been here for a while .
we're going to hop in and out .
this is my friend darl . what's happening , darl?
you think you could comp him?
comp?
it will cost you sugar .
it 's okay .
just tell him what you told me .
i got friendly with a guy in baton rouge .
i won't tell you who .
it 's not in my best interest .
once a month he pays us to put on a lingerie show in le salle .
it 's a deal .
you ain't got to do nothing you don't want to .
some girls make dates to make extra cash .
i'm not that greedy .
at the tidewater?
it 's okay .
he needs to know .
i'll never say this in court .
we finished up our show , counted up our tips and we're leaving .
it 's 2 : 15 .
i always check to see how long the ride back takes .
we almost ran over her .
she was walking away from the club .
i really didn't even know it was mona until you told me , sweetie ... that it was in le salle that she was found .
and the governor was there?
we're well paid to say " no " to that question .
well , i hate to see a pretty woman standing all alone .
you didn't answer my question .
what question was that? what's the deal with darl?
you know more about his situation than i do .
it is a local matter .
somebody paid that girl .
lf it wasn't her , it 'd be the next .
or the drinking or the graft .
you know he wouldn't have done anything that hadn't been done .
are you telling me you want me to turn the clock back?
18 . 5 % of my appointments have been to women and minorities .
nowadays , a smart , qualified woman like you ... has a place in louisiana public service .
but not darl .
so how could mona model lingerie?
you saw her , brownie .
she had the body for it .
no , i don't mean that .
i mean ...
when the big cadillac bump in the road there you might notice .
here's how you do it , darl : you tuck it in between your legs ... and put on a little g string .
all right ...
so what's next , inspector?
the phone number mona called you from , do you have that?
did you lose it?
it 's in a file at the office .
well , i know it by heart .
i memorized it .
maybe you'll have better luck .
are all the girls here lesbians?
well , some of them .
now , you see the worst side of men working here .
so you worked here?
yeah .
tips are good , money is good .
so do you have to do that tuck in job yourself , i mean ...
darl , it's eating you up , isn't it?
hello? ls this tidewater?
no, l don't think so .
this is darl hardwick .
who am i speaking to?
darl , it's me .
me who?
you got the phone booth out front my place .
darl , i have never been paid for that shoe truck job .
i am not the sheriff anymore .
i can't do anything about it .
i ain't got no shoes either .
everybody got new shoes ...
i don't got no new shoes .
we'll talk later about it . lwant to ask you something important : do you know that d. o. a we found at the swamp?
she made a call from your phone booth at 3 am .
did you see her?
sundays i don't open till 8 .
excuse me , i need to run your credit card .
ornelle , listen , i've got to get going .
bye bye .
i ain't getting no new shoes .
tell me something personal .
you don't want to hear that .
no ...
no ...
my daddy is a crazy drunk .
well , like father , like son .
i'm not either .
i drink like everybody else does , you know?
what about your momma?
i never really knew her .
she died when i was pretty young .
my daddy didn't know how to take care of kids really so ... me and my brother pretty much were raised by my grandparents .
well , what's your brother like?
he's ...
he's different .
i don't know .
my mother's death kind of affected him differently .
probably more , really .
how so?
he turned out ... just a little off somewhere , i don't know .
problematic kid , really .
he's ...
i'll put it this way : when they asked me to run for sheriff ... they said they'd badge me only under one condition : that i'd run my brother out of the parish .
so ...
who's they?
the people who sign my checks .
so i ran him out of the parish .
but that's not helping us connect the governor to mona , is it?
i'm going to try to do something .
you can't drive home like that .
look , i've got a couch , okay?
it 's got " darl " all over it .
flower
come to me
winter is almost here
lf you drink water before you go to bed , the room won't spin .
thanks .
are you sure you don't want a pillow?
no , i'm alright .
frankly , i'm just glad to have a couch .
sweet dreams .
you too .
good night .
i just ...
darl ...
i just ...
it 's too soon .
i can't .
no , i know .
i was just ...
i was thinking about not being able to sleep or something .
wake up !
darl !
i thought you'd gone .
i forgot my keys .
you left them inside .
go inside and warm up .
i'll go fetch some coffee .
hello?
hello?
anybody home?
oh ! ls mona here?
i had an appointment at 9 .
are you running over?
running over what?
i'm going to come back later .
so you know , some old shit came by saying he had an appointment .
shoot !
it 's one of mona's monthly's .
whatever operation it is , it's disgusting .
did you see my keys?
his name is mr. prestman , and he isn't a freak !
he misses his wife , okay?
they were married for 5o years .
she dies , so he misses her , so he likes to wear her dresses .
ls that so fucking horrible?
that 's perfectly normal .
your keys are on the mantel .
darl , what are you so afraid of?
i think the whole damn situation here is a little odd .
really?
you ran your own brother out of town . ls that normal?
you don't know my family !
girls get fucked by their dads !
you're a stripper that lives with a freak !
call that normal?
don't talk about someone i love !
i talk about who i want to !
you wanted to fuck me and didn't even know if i had a dick or not !
somebody who couldn't deal with their sexual impulses killed mona .
shut up !
you shut up !
fucking freak !
get out of my fuckingway before i slap the shit out of you !
shut up !
mona , the d. o. a. , was sent here as a lingerie model .
i've got a witness that puts him at your gate at 2 : 15 ... and a phone record that puts him at a phone booth at ornelle's ... a mile that away .
and ... there's this little deal here .
i found this bloody shoe in your backyard .
that 's it?
no .
there's a matter of your dog .
buster was found at the body .
nothing that would stick .
stand up .
ls that fun?
oh , yeah .
you're a sweetie .
he's clean .
you know what an " imbroglio " is?
no , i don't .
that was one of my favorite words in college .
it means ...
" complicated situation " .
we had a party .
the kind that you don't bring your wife to .
that freak could've passed for miss america .
maybe she was here , and maybe she wasn't .
whatever , bottom line we did not kill her .
him .
cletus can tell you .
we were locked and cleared out by 2 : 3o .
when that truck driver saw that woman on the highway ... we were home with our wives .
burnson's people are on my ass to go public .
lf the press gets a worth of that ... our governor partying with a transsexual who ends up dead .
he's going to drop like a rock .
and your casino project too .
burnson probably set the whole thing up himself .
the members of this club are honorable men , darl .
you want that kind of enemies?
i always wondered what it was like in here .
it smells like shit !
you threw a spit ball on my head .
wait a minute , darl .
i'm getting this thing overturned and my job back , i promise you .
you think you know what you're doing , but you don't .
really? ls that right?
lf by tomorrow the appeal board doesn't reconsider my case ...
i'm going to press .
i'll call burnson quicker than shit .
sleep good .
what the hell do we do now?
something they didn't teach you at the kennedy business school .
darl , wait up there !
hold on , son !
we thought about it ... and we generally accept your demands .
we'll work in good faith to get your job back .
but there's a loose end .
that scarlet person , does she know you know?
she gave a false address on the death certificate .
you know how we can contact her?
she's in new orleans .
we know that .
i'll get you an address .
i'll give you a call .
the sooner , the better .
what's wrong with you?
so when you lost your badge , that's it , you lost everything .
you got that right .
so whatever it takes ...
i mean , to get it back , that's what i got to do , that's about it?
i never missed a day of work , i had a perfect record .
even after you cleaned her off the floor?
what?
who?
that wasn't my fault .
david always said you shot her .
that faggot is every bit as crazy as she was .
myself , i never believed you had the guts .
she pulled my chrome handled smith & wesson with a 6 inch barrel ... and was waving it at me , screaming her hysterical shit !
she was crazy !
she puts it right there to the side of her head .
that 's when i said these last words : " go ahead , bitch , do it !
i made it into work the next day ...
i pulled a full shift ...
i had a perfect record .
here you go , sugar .
howdy , ma'am .
well , hello , cowboy .
i'm looking for scarlet .
she ain't here .
she's over that strip joint?
maybe .
she said you're the one trying to find the bastard who killed mona .
any luck?
we're making a little progress .
girls like me got a free shot bull's eye on our backs .
lf you solve this one , it 'd be a first .
and you are so fine that i might give you that purple heart myself .
i'd appreciate that .
have a good day .
yeah , we're here now .
i'll call you later .
all right .
she gave a false address on the death certificate .
you know how we can contact her?
what's happening , man?
ls scarlet around?
yeah , she's here .
that's us$ 1o .
scarlet is doing it foryou , working hard for appreciation .
show it by stepping up there and tipping that sexy lady .
hi , baby .
can i get you something to drink , baby?
it 's a 2 drink minimum .
everybody in the house put those hands together, make some noise !
forscarlet .
we've got to get out of here .
i'm not going anywhere with you .
the governor's after you .
how do they know about me?
don't worry about that .
you can't be back here !
i'm talking to her , all right?
i don't care what you're doing !
i said i'm talking to her !
okay , i know him !
gitter , it's me .
i know him .
i don't give a fuck if he's your dad !
we've got rules !
you can leave on a stretcher or you can leave like a gentleman .
come on , man .
hey , stop it !
fucker !
i told your mother fucking ass !
darl !
darl !
i'm going to call an ambulance .
oh , my god , you think you ...
look who we found !
stop it !
get up !
stop it !
come on !
let go , damn it !
just get in the car !
come on !
get off !
no !
get in there !
let go of her !
let her go right now !
get your hand away from your pocket !
right now !
take the keys !
go to the truck !
calm down , buddy !
i'm a cop !
i said get your hand away !
calm down , buddy !
hand out of the pocket !
come on !
hurry up !
we've got to get them !
pull over !
what?
they're going to kill me !
let me in !
let me in !
the fucking door !
hurry !
hurry up !
where are we going?
to the tv .
everybody needs help .
see if you can read that?
gizmo hebert republican party headquarter " .
shit !
they've i . d . 'd the truck .
where's david?
what happened to you?
we almost got caught .
don't worry , i'll tell you later .
david !
i know you knew mona .
the guys who killed her are after us .
i need to borrow your car .
i really need your help out here .
please?
david , come on .
do you have the keys?
yes .
what does it look like?
it's out front .
it's a volvo .
lf anybody comes around asking ...
i don't know anything .
take these .
you might need a disguise .
being kicked out of le salle was the best that happened to me .
i wonder what makes people turn out the way they turn out .
i don't know .
mona said she always liked her barbies from the gecko .
okay , so we tell them that you want to talk to the press .
don't be afraid to tell them everything you know about mona ...
tidewater and the whole shooting match .
when your story gets out , that's your protection .
are you all right?
i can't believe i'm depending on republicans to save me .
where's gizmo?
hey , darl .
darl misread our intentions .
we weren't going to hurt you .
we wanted to give you a paid trip to cancun till after the election .
your little elves put a bullet through my truck .
that was a mistake .
a mistake?
darl , what's going on?
hell if i know .
a truce .
more like a mexican stand off .
sister felicia confessed .
the anti casino folks ... planned to pick up a transsexual from a new orleans club .
sister felicia was in all this?
partially .
she would tip gizmo ... when the governor showed up at tidewater .
gizmo picked mona up from the bar and invited to work a party .
drove her out with a premeditated purpose of taking a few photos ... of a transgender person socializing with the governor .
you killed mona?
no .
i'll pass a polygraph .
but you drove her to tidewater .
okay .
but when our telephoto lens came out , freaks got offended ... we had an m. o. thought it was for money .
she was hysterical .
it got iffy , so we kicked her out of the car and george jetson .
you just left her?
yeah , bubba .
we just left her .
then who killed mona?
i can tell you with certainty ... that nobody in this room committed a capital crime .
both parties committed failures of judgment only .
now we should negotiate a binding and good faith settlement ... to keep this story in this room .
let the campaign decide the issues .
it's what the people want .
lf you can't tell me who killed mona , you have nothing for me .
there it is .
a fly in the ketchup .
somebody like mona or scarlet here might have a conscience .
this place stinks worse than tidewater .
let's get out of here .
you're the last person to be lecturing anybody on ethics .
you're right , judge .
you're always right .
darl !
darl , hold up .
you're a parole violator who's fired on police .
don't be stupid .
that's what i do best .
i won't go to the press .
i don't give a shit who wins the election .
i'll find out who killed mona .
lf anybody tries to stop me , i'll go kicking and screaming .
are you going to let him leave?
i'm out of my jurisdiction .
you're out of your job .
daril .
there's a woman out here .
it's about real justice for mona .
this is darl hardwick .
who am i speaking to?
it's me .
you got the phone booth out front of my place .
she made a call from your phone booth at 3 am .
did you see her?
no , i didn't .
ornelle says he was asleep .
he didn't see anything .
something about this place really feels weird .
ls that it?
o. 65 + o, 4o .
us$ 1 . o5 .
with tax , us$ 1 . 6o .
well , you got it down , don't you , ornelle?
i still haven't been paid .
take that out of your judge .
you have a ladies room i could use?
ladies room is closed .
it's unclean .
well , do you have a man's bathroom?
i don't believe in that , ma'am .
there's a dixie burger up ahead .
she doesn't want to go there , she wants to use the bathroom .
you're not one of them?
one of who?
them who use the bathroom they ain't supposed to use?
where's the key , ornelle?
lost it .
who's going to pay for this?
what is it , darl?
who do i bill for that?
you can't go in there !
that's employees only !
darl?
oh , my god !
you sat there and watched that girl through that peephole?
lf this gun matches that bullet that killed her , it's all over .
why?
i want you to tell me .
fuck !
tell me you want me !
fuck me !
fuck me !
fuck you !
bitch , bitch ...
get out you freak !
freak !
oh , my god !
you tricked me , you bitch !
you tricked me , you whore !
stay away from me , you son of a bitch !
help me !
please !
you ain't telling nobody on me !
i'll kill you !
i'll kill you !
bitch !
he never should have went in the ladies '.
that's not right .
that's for ladies .
that's all i'm going to say about it .
oh , my god .
i got it .
hello?
hi .
how are things?
fine .
that's good .
look , you want mom?
yeah .
tell her it's important .
she might be needed here .
hold on .
hey , wait .
what?
i just want to tell you i love you both .
hold on ...
i'll get mom .
mom !
ln a baton rouge press conference , the governor stated ... that yesterday's loss is not the end of his political career .
and although i am conceding this race, l am not defeated .
not when there's work left to do for the people of louisiana .
well , look how beautiful we are .
mona is smiling down on us .
i know that all of us have lost people .
and every time i think about her being face down that swamp ... it breaks my heart .
but we're not going to talk about that today .
she was beautiful and she'd like to be remembered beautiful .
and she'd be so happy that all of you are here .
thank you so much .
i was hoping you'd come .
i'm giving things away .
i didn't want to go through it alone .
i knew who you were before going to your office .
david told me you were brothers , and that you were a real dick .
we both thought it best that i not tell you we knew each other .
cause you might hold it against us .
i probably would have .
i'm sorry for lying about it .
i think i'm going to thank somebody for a car .
it's about time .
are you going to be here?
yeah , i'll be right here .
all right .
