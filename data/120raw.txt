forty cents on the dollar , $640, 000 to you .
here's $150, 000 front money .
get you the rest in two , three days .
who owned these?
malibu equity and investments .
roger van zant .
owns banks in the caymans ... ... runs investment portfolios for offshore drug money .
stuff like that .
so?
you ripped off his bearer bonds .
he's insured .
that's the point .
he collects 100 percent from the insurance .
he's a player .
maybe he buys his bonds back from us ... ... for 60 percent of their value .
makes 40 percent on top of the 100 percent .
sell it back to him , that's an extra $320, 000 to you .
try it on .
kelso called .
about what?
a score he's putting out , he wants you to look at .
i don't need his score .
i got my own .

they were airborne .
they taped the last few seconds of the black and whites .
stolen from fresno two weeks ago .
yellow pickup truck out of whittier a day before yesterday .

does this look like gangbangers working the local 7 11 to you?
robbery homicide's taking it .
we got three motorists .
all they saw were men with masks .
they were distant .
tv man over there , however , he was closer .
did he id anybody?
he was hiding .
he heard it mostly .
what about them?
according to the tv man , this guy started mouthing off .
smart .
somebody called a guard " slick .
now , i figure this guy ... ... went for that hold out piece , ankle holster .
from here ... ... bang , bang ... ... bang , bang , bang .
this side .
this guy has got what appears to be a double tap entry wound to the sternum .
tattooing around the head wound , scorched bone , close range .
probably executed .
it was $1 . 6 million in bearer bonds .
they ignored the loose cash .
'cause they had no time .
they were on a clock .
which means they knew our response time to a 2 11 ... ... had our air , immobilized it , entered ... ... escaped in under three minutes .
it's a good spot here .
we got good escape routes .
two freeways ... ... within a quarter of a mile .
traffic video camera?
probably disabled .
check it anyway .
you recognize the m. o.?
m. o ... ... is that they're good .
once it escalated into a murder one beef for all , after they killed two guards ... ... they didn't hesitate .
popped guard no .
3 because ... what difference does it make?
why leave a living witness?
drop of a hat , these guys will rock and roll .
the shape charge .
the shape charge indicates that they are technically proficient .
proficient enough to go in on the prowl .
let's look for recent high line burglaries that have mystified us .
run " slick " as an alias to the fbl .
you'll get the phone book .
do it anyway .
who's moving the bearer bonds?
check the usual fences .
you and i will check cuzomano and torena .

he was making a move .
i had to get it on .
split's in the car .
i took out of ours evenly ... ... to make up for his full end ... ... 'cause i want to pay off and get rid of this motherfucker right now .

there's more in a couple of days , so don't sweat it .
we're late .

honey ... ... it ain't worth the risks you take for $8, 000 .
like in " risk versus reward .
let's go .

there's no point talking .
you're just a child growing older .
what does that mean?
we're not making forward progress like real grown up adults living our lives ... ... because i married a gambling junkie .

the operation doesn't skip a beat .
we all make out .

good , because there's no percentage if everyone gets upset .
you have your man call me and we'll set the meet .
yeah , okay .

what was it?
you don't want to know .
i'd like to know what's behind that grim look on your face .
i don't do that .
you know it .
let's go .
you never told me i'd be excluded .
i told you when we hooked up ... ... that you'd have to share me ... ... with all the bad people and all the ugly events on this planet .
and i bought into that sharing ... ... because i love you .
i love you fat , bald , money , no money , driving a bus .
i don't care .
but you have got to be present like a normal guy .
that's sharing .
this is not sharing , this is leftovers .
hi , honey , guess what?
i walked into this house today ...
... where this junkie asshole just fried his baby in a microwave ...
... because he was crying too loud , so let me share that with you .
come on , let's share that and in sharing it ...
... we'll somehow cathartically dispel all that heinous shit .
right?
wrong .
you know why?
'cause you prefer the normal routine .
we fuck and you don't speak .
'cause i got to hold on to my angst .
i preserve it ... ... because i need it .
it keeps me sharp , on the edge .
where i gotta be .
you don't live with me .
you live among the remains of dead people .
you sift through the detritus .
you read the terrain .
you search for signs of passing ... ... for the scent of your prey ... ... and then you hunt them down .
that's the only thing you're committed to .
the rest is the mess you leave as you pass through .
what i don't understand is why i can't cut loose of you .
let's go , baby .
i met the manager .
is that the boss?
i did time for what that motherfucker does every day .
can you just handle it till we find you something new?
can you do that?
ain't a hard time been invented that i cannot handle .
why're you hanging with me?
because i'm proud of you .
you're proud of me?
why the hell are you proud of me?
come on home .
what were you doing there?
i was skiing .
i was trying to ski .
that's what people do there .
you go skiing ... ... and you meet people .
you try to have a good time .
did you have a good time?
no .
why not?
i'm not good at meeting people .
you met me .
that happened without my thinking about it .
which is why i probably ....
no , it's because you are fine .
take off with me for a while .
where?
new zealand .
when?
i have to go separate .
you can meet me there .
but my job ....
i got money .
you don't need money .
you could set up a studio and work there .
i don't know .
what's there to know?
are you married?
what?
the last thing i am is married .
i'm a needle starting at zero going the other way .
then , all of a sudden ... ... someone like you comes along .
you don't know me .
i know enough .
come with me .
what's wrong?
nothing's wrong .
everything's right .
will you go?
yeah .
good .
hi , sweetie .
you forget your mom was picking you up?
no .
so , what's going on?
i felt like being alone .
come on , i'll drive you home .
what's happening?

vincent , he's not carrying anything .
i see .
here we go .
not till my boss says so .
both of them are not carrying anything .
let them go .
what do you mean?
we can take them
on what?
they didn't steal anything yet .
it gets knocked back to a misdemeanor , they do six months and they're out .
no fucking way .
i'm not taking the heat from my boss .
they are not walking .
that's exactly what they'll do .
they'll walk .
this is my operation .
i have tactical command that supersedes your rank .
they will walk away and you will let them .
fuck !
back to work .
lapd , the g , what?
where the fuck did this heat come from?
maybe it's the score they were onto .
the place , not us .
because it's been hit a couple of times .
assume they got our phones , our houses .
assume they got us right here , right now ... ... as we sit .
everything .
assume it all .
how will we buy the bank package?
i'll front that .
what about van zant?
with the heat we got , you want to play world war ii on the streets with van zant?
no , i want my 750 .
i got more motivation to whack van zant than either of you .
he is a fucking luxury .
our problem is to take the bank , or split right now .
do not go home , do not pack , nothing .
thirty seconds flat from now , we are gone on our separate ways .
that's it .
the bank is worth the risk .
i need it , brother .
we should stay and take it down .
that's where i come out .
i roll with you , neil .
whatever .
whatever .
not on this one .
on this one , you're on your own .
you figure this is the best thing to do?
this is the best thing to do?
i've got plans , i'm going away after , so the reward is worth the stretch .
but elaine takes good care of you .
you got plenty put away .
you got t bonds , real estate .
if i were you , i would be smart and cut loose of this .
for me ... ... the action is the juice .

because she's got a great ass !
and you got your head all the way up it .
jesus .
ferocious , aren't i?
when i think of asses ... ... a woman's ass ... ... something comes out of me .
so?
so , no big thing .
all i want ... ... is her husband and his whole fucking crew .
you'll work with sgt. drucker .
san clemente road and hermosa ... ... that's where we cut through the fence .

refinery only pays by check .
no cash around .
same for the scrap yard .
stealing hubcaps?
a refinery and a scrap yard .
what the hell is going on?
that's what we are trying to figure out .
we thought we had it .
thought we had it .
i got an idea ... ... on what they were looking at .
want to know what they're looking at?
i mean , is this guy something , or is he something?
this crew is good .
know what they're looking at?

us .
the lapd .
the police department .
we just got made .
yeah !

kelso come through?
yeah , you can build a bank with these .
name is hanna .
first name , vincent .
i smeared this sergeant five yards .
hanna's all over you .
he's on all the work cars .
michael's house .
shiherlis's .
not yours .
they've been losing you at night .
he's a hot dog .
graduate school .
marine corps .
lieutenant in robbery homicide .
he's taken down some heavy crews .
he blew away frankie in chicago .
he was a fucking maniac .
he was working narcotics before that .
divorced twice .
current wife's justine .
he's why the extra heat .
the vice sergeant ... ... says hanna likes you ... ... thinks you're some kind of star .
you do this sharp , that sharp .
look how sharp this guy is to figure that .
funny as a heart attack .
three marriages?
do you think that means he likes staying home?
means he's one of those guys out there ... ... prowling around all night , dedicated .
with him and this much heat , you should pass .
it's worth the stretch .
this guy can hit or miss .
you can't miss once .
you sure?
i am sure .
let's go to the garage .
where are we going?
where are you going?
out .
what are they on?
tac 9 .
they're northbound out lax on the 405 .
we got four ground units .
this is vincent hanna in air 18 .
who have i got?
this is jj .
i'm in air 40 .
richard glover's with me .
it's on the 105 eastbound ... ... approaching the 1 10 .
revolving tail?
i got two units in front , three behind .
ok , have one of them pick me up at the vermont on ramp .
let's go .
am i 100 yards , or what?
am i close or far , or what?
three hundred yards , center lane .
how're you doing?
what do you say i buy you a cup of coffee?
yeah , sure .
let's go .
follow me .
seven years in folsom .
in the hole for three .
mcneil before that .
mcneil as tough as they say?
you looking to become a penologist?
you looking to go back?
i chased down some crews .
guys just looking to fuck up , get busted back .
that you?
you must've worked some dipshit crews .
i worked all kinds .
you see me doing liquor store holdups with a " born to lose " tattoo on my chest?
no , i do not .
right .
i am never going back .
then don't take down scores .
i take scores .
trying to stop guys like me .
so you never wanted a regular type life?
w 'the fuck is that?
barbecues and ball games?
yeah .
this regular type life , that your life?
my life?
no , my life ....
my life's a disaster zone .
i got a stepdaughter so fucked up ... ... because her real father is this large type asshole .
i got a wife .
we're passing each other on the down slope of a marriage .
my third .
because i spend all my time chasing guys like you around the block .
that's my life .
don't let yourself get attached to anything you are not willing to walk out on in 30 seconds ...
... flat if you feel the heat around the corner .
if you're on me and you got to move when i move ... ... how do you expect to keep a marriage?
that's an interesting point .
what are you , a monk?
i have a woman .
what do you tell her?
i tell her i'm a salesman .
so , if you spot me coming around that corner ... ... you're just gonna walk out on this woman?
not say good bye?
that's the discipline .
that's pretty vacant .
it is what it is .
it's that , or we both better go do something else .
i don't know how to do anything else .
neither do i.
i don't much want to , either .
neither do i.
you know , i have this recurring dream .
i'm sitting at this big banquet table and ... ... all the victims of all the murders i ever worked are there ... ... and they're staring at me with these black eyeballs ... ... because they got eight ball hemorrhages from the head wounds .
and there they are , these big balloon people ... ... because i found them two weeks after they'd been under the bed .
the neighbors reported the smell ... ... and there they are ... ... all just sitting there .
what do they say?
nothing .
no talk?
they have nothing to say .
we just look at each other .
they look at me ... ... and that's it .
that's the dream .
i have one where i'm drowning .
i gotta wake myself up and start breathing or i'll die in my sleep .
know what that's about?
having enough time .
enough time ... ... to do what you want to do?
that's right .
you doing it now?
no , not yet .
you know , we're sitting here ... ... like a couple of regular fellas .
you do what you do , and i do what i gotta do .
now that we've been face to face ... ... if i'm there and i gotta put you away ... ... i won't like it .
but , i tell you ... ... if it's between you ... ... and some poor bastard whose wife you're gonna turn into a widow ... ... brother ... ... you are going down .
there's a flip side to that coin .
what if you do got me boxed in ... ... and i gotta put you down?
because no matter what ... ... you will not get in my way .
we've been face to face , yeah .
but i will not hesitate .
not for a second .
maybe that's the way it'll be .
or ... ... who knows?
maybe we'll never see each other again .
they dumped us .
what?
they dumped us .
what do you mean?
chris slipped away .
he doesn't talk about their scores ... ... so there's nothing for me to get from marciano .
i just tried .
what about cheritto?
same .
transponders got put on a bus to san clemente .
they dumped all our surveillance?
yes , at the same time .
9 : 00 p . m .
i had coffee with mccauley half an hour ago !
we were on you .
then mccauley drives in to lax where surveillance can't fly over .
his car's still there .
he's gone .
does anybody have any idea where the fuck these people are?

not a thing .
and not hearing bothers me more .
where's this guy?

waingro .
my name's waingro .
i've been living in this office .
how well do you know him?
we took some major scores together .
why haven't i heard from him?
he's probably busy right now .
but he's real thorough .
he ain't going to forget about you .
that's reassuring .
i got some moves i could make here .

you want to put dominick in the bedroom?
he stays with me .
so , what now?
he's right .
you want out?
this is out .
you believe you have to betray chris?
no shit .
that's right .
you would have to .
see , if you don't betray chris , you victimize dominick .
'cause he'll be an orphan when you go to prison as an accessory ... ... 'cause you got no parents to take him .
so he ends up raised in foster homes ... ... juvenile facilities .
then he steals a car .
then he winds up in gladiator academies like chino and tracy .
fucked for life .
you know what happens , because you've been there .
dominick didn't get a chance yet to choose his life .
but chris did .
if you give up chris , you get off clean .
you can do it ... ... for your kid , so you can raise him .
what else are you selling?
all kinds of shit .
but i don't have to sell this , you know it .
this kind of shit here sells itself .
here's an update .
drucker's on line 2 .
hold on for a second .
drucker's on the other line .
conference him in .
go ahead .
vincent , it's me .
one answer .
what's it going to be?
we're set here .
she'll make the call .
that's good .
here's the deal .
hugh benny has reformed his wayward life ... ... and become a born again good citizen .
apparently , neil got sold out to us by this cowboy named waingro .
van zant .
units are at van zant's house as we speak ... ... because he got shot dead earlier tonight .
if neil goes after anybody else , it's going to be waingro .
waingro just got himself a suite at the airport marquis ... ... under the name jamieson .
he's there now .
i want you to get that to bail bondsmen , bookies ... ... assignment officers and snitches in county .
anyone you can think of who'll put it on the street .
deploy a team at the hotel ... ... and personally check their coms every 30 minutes .
because maybe neil will go for him .
how're you feeling?
banged up , but i'll live .
he's here .
neil is still here .
i can feel it .
for how long?
seven , eight hours , max .
what did you do?
that was you?
i don't sell metal .
would have been okay , you fly out after .
now it's jammed .
we gotta go together .
those other people were with you?
my friend , michael ... ... he knew the risks .
when it rains , you get wet .
get packed .
let's go .
why did you do this to me?

i'm angry .
i'm very angry , ralph .
you can ball my wife if she wants you to .
you can lounge around here on her sofa .
in her ex husband's ... ... dead tech , post modernistic , bullshit house ... ... if you want to .
but you do not get to watch ... ... my fucking ... ... television set !
for god's sake .
put the television set down .
i never cheated on you , bitch .
maybe you should have .
i should have?
you're a party to this .
i made ralph fuck you because it makes me feel good .
our situation is absurd .
