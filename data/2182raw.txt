most people don't see it .
or don't want to see it .
the evidence is right there .
but they refuse to make the connection .
we have colleen on line one .
oh .
absolutely .
we are living in a world of high strangeness .
the fact is .
all this activity stated happening at a cetain definite point in our history .
before the early '50s .
there's nothing .
then it all began .
the sightings .
the signals ... too many to deny .
so you have to ask yourself ...
what specific event caused this sudden uptick in alien visitation after thousands of years of silence?
it was our atomic energy .
they detected it .
i mean .
that many megatons?
how couldn't they?
and then .
they followed it here .
what do they want?
are they studying us?
warning us?
havesting us?
we don't know .
but the fact is they're here .
they're here now .
and they are not going away .
mercy , six two actual .
we've lost visual contact .
say position .
over .
roger , six two .
stand by .
chopper's lost us .
i think we took a wrong turn .
can't see a damn thing out here .
friday .
april 13th .
my last day alive ... maybe .
what does that matter when so many have died before me?
they said she was beautiful .
i suppose she was .
the pat of her that was human .
anyway .
and the pat that wasn't?
what about that?
did the men she killed understand .
in some final flash before dying .
what she really was?
cold .
indifferent .
inhuman .
insatiable .
and terrifyingly wondeful .
and what about the civilization that beamed her dna code through space?
they knew we'd use it .
knew we'd mix it with our own genes .
but did they know the monster that would result?
twice .
she was built .
twice .
she brought destruction .
and now it's my turn to take eve's body .
take her dying dna and somehow create something better .
more pure .
only then will we understand why she was sent .
only then .
slow down .
easy .
she's dead .
i don't think she cares at this point .
you up from the reserves or something?
something like that .
wait .
what?
the road .
we're supposed to be on a gravel road .
the one we passed back there .
pull over , man .
i told you to stay on the road !
did you hear me?
i said pull over .
six two , this is mercy .
put down the radio .
now .
i said put it down now !
okay !
okay !
chill out !
what are you , back from iraq or something?
shut up .
now get out .
jesus fucking christ !
anybody !
this is mercy !
cargo's alive !
repeat , the cargo is alive ...
now get out as i told you .
what the hell are you doin '?
mercy six two , come in .
do you read me?
over .
do you read me?
over?
nothing .
find them .
are you ...
eve .
i got him .
16 miles east southeast .
looks like they're not moving .
still no contact?
mercy six two , come in .
come in .
do you read me?
over .
negative .
send a ground team in there to meet us .
six two ground .
six two ground .
this is six two actual .
rendezvous .
mercy .
coordinates .
87 foxtrot .
over .
can't see anyone down there .
let's pay 'em a visit .
who's he?
specialist robert kelly .
who else was here?
just the driver .
where's his body?
no idea , sir .
i want a full autopsy .
check every inch of this ambulance and destroy it .
and find that driver .
yes , sir .
good afternoon , sir .
this monster's been sucking in natural gas and spewing out electricity for over 50 years .
now , you might be wondering why we still need this in the 21 st century .
after all , it's loud , expensive , inefficient , temperamental , and it smells terrible .
and it's the best way we have of keeping the lights on .
but , if you follow me , i'm gonna show you how we're gonna put it out of business .
come on upstairs .
come on in , folks .
just gather around here .
how's it going , guys?
okay , dean .
warning ...
ladies and gentlemen , meet the tokamak .
you're looking at a prototype fusion reactor .
the university cut a deal with the city to build this down here .
now , we're just in the experimental stages , but soon , everything from cars and cell phones to washing machines , and even spacecraft , will be powered with clean , limitless fusion energy , all courtesy of the atom .
how does it work?
glad you asked .
glen , you wanna fire this thing up?
sure .
we take hydrogen and deuterium , put them together inside the reactor , and then heat the mixture to 10 million degrees .
we then try to get the two elements to combine or fuse , which would produce a staggering amount of energy .
basically , it's how the sun works .
so you're telling us inside that thing , it's as hot as the sun .
yeah .
isn't that dangerous?
yes , it is .
very .
but don't worry .
inside the tokamak are a series of magnets powered by the plant here .
the magnets keep the super hot plasma contained at all times .
positive air flow keeps the room pressurized , and the walls here are six feet thick , which is two feet thicker than the walls in the pyramids of giza .
that's a little trivia for you .
now , i'd love to be able to fire this thing up myself and show you , but unfortunately , there's only one guy who can do that , and that's the head of the department , with his own personal access key .
and now , for the highlight .
on sublevel c is the plant cafeteria , where i understand the grilled cheese is excellent , but the tuna fish sandwich is not .
i'd love to join you , but i gotta get back to class .
so , anyway , thank you very much .
thank you .
thank you so much .
thank you very much .
no problem .
thanks a lot .
have a good day .
bye bye .
behold , the t 4 bacteriophage virus ... nature's most elegant killing machine .
look at it .
it's beautiful , isn't it?
invading our living cells , it has killed unabated since the beginning of time .
who made it?
where did it come from?
what immortal hand or eye framed this dreadful symmetry?
you know what , just between us ,
i think ...
who are you?
i'm dean .
dean?
of what?
leisure studies?
no , dean's my name .
an atrocious one .
sorry , sir?
i don't even think you're in this class .
yes , i am .
i think not .
because if you were , dean , you obviously would have arrived on time along with the rest of your classmates .
won't happen again , sir .
as i was saying , between us ,
i think we made these viruses , you and i.
they're our own renegade microbes , escaped from our cells ... evolving , mutating , they become our curse , our punishment .
multiplying our sorrows ... the perfect predator .
it's hardly perfect .
what was that?
nothing .
no , no , no .
repeat your comment .
well , it's just that you said that viruses are perfect , but they're not .
for one thing , they can't reproduce on their own , and that's their achilles 'heel right there .
without a host mechanism , they're just slowly dying proteins .
it seems we have a future cdc administrator among us .
i don't get it .
on level four of the center for disease control , there are preserved in frozen nitrogen the world's last remaining strains of smallpox ... strains which are now scheduled for destruction .
rendered extinct .
like the dodo bird , dinosaur ... ... and i guess that pleases you , right?
who are you to judge which species lives or dies?
what?
what the hell was that?
specist .
specist?
someone who's prejudiced against other species .
yeah , i know what it is , but of all the things i've been called ...
did you get beat up on the playground a lot?
shut up .
got any change?
yeah .
word .
come on , man .
i will buy you something nice out of the vending machines .
thanks .
uh huh .
it's 'cause i like you .
dean !
can i have a word?
shit .
i gotta go , dude .
i got an online auction , you know?
yes , dr. turner?
as you know , being your department head , it's my responsibility to review your funding .
i must say i'm concerned with what i've seen .
concerned?
you're all over the place !
physics , biochemistry , bioengineering ... too many interests , too few results .
especially for graduate level work .
sir , lately the tokamak's been giving us a very ...
oh , forget it .
the tokamak's history .
fusion power's a pipe dream !
what?
we're ending our contract on it by the end of the month .
so you either find yourself an approved project overseen by a professor ... or you forfeit your scholarship next semester .
is that clear?
wait , wait , wait .
you're cutting the funding?
you can't cut the funding !
i can do anything i want .
no , sir , just listen to me for one minute !
asshole !
cat?
cat?
cat .
i'm hungry .
how did you get out of the lab?
i'm hungry !
i'd be , too , if i grew six inches a day .
lobster .
what?
they play it every hour .
red lobster .
for the seafood lover in you .
what else did you learn from television today?
no , no , no .
if you eat upstairs , use silverware , all right?
this is a fork ... this is a knife .
but with lobster , you take the fork and you stick it in there like that , and you pull it down and you ... pull .
sara .
excuse me?
you don't have a name .
sara .
yes .
sara .
before you fall asleep , i want you to promise me something .
i won't lock you in here anymore if you promise not to leave this house .
ever .
because the outside world is dangerous for you .
dangerous?
you're gonna grow up very fast .
your childhood ...
lasts only days , not years .
see , you were the third generation of something very special .
an alien species ... ... created with a new sequence of dna , received in a transmission from deep space .
that's right .
some of my colleagues tried to study your kind .
things ended badly .
i won't make those same mistakes .
i just want to protect you because ...
i think ...
i think there's a message , a very important message , inside you ... a reason why you're here .
someday , you'll tell me what it is ... in your own time .
are there others like me?
not like you .
you're unique ... and the most important thing in my life .
wouldn't worry .
she won't be giving you any more trouble .
signature?
wait a minute .
wait just a minute .
this can't be right .
pregnant?
she was .
gave birth , too , from the looks of it .
the yellow copy's yours .
i just need the top copy for my records .
no records .
this never happened .
and burn the body .
now .
yes , sir .
abbott?
dr. turner here .
i've been looking everywhere foryou .
that repot to the foundation ...
i'll need to account for how you've been using their funds .
why?
if line items are too much trouble .
then just give me a general ...
damn .
look , dr. turner , i really don't have any time for ...
dr. abbott .
yes?
tell me , where is it?
where's what?
who are you?
where is it?
look .
listen , i don't know what you're talking about , or who you are ...
you can either leave now , or i'm gonna call security .
there is no ... security .
hang on .
i'm getting help .
you don't ... recognize me , do you?
no .
the ambulance ... that night ... in the woods .
remember?
you were the boy .
a half breed .
how did you get in that ...
where did you ...
i escaped ... into the world .
how did you find me?
things will go much ... easier for you if you tell me where it is .
you're having respiratory failure .
look , until i know what's going on , i can't help you , all right?
let me draw some blood .
some others are sick , too .
others?
half breeds .
those like me .
i do see some foreign structures here , but none of it's viral .
if i didn't know better , i'd say it was just pollen .
it is pollen .
and some dust particles , too ... very common in the bloodstream .
nothing that should make you this sick .
antihistamines should stabilize you .
should clear it up .
are the others the same way?
yes ... sore throat , skin rash , and no explanation .
you shouldn't ... you shouldn't be sick like this .
take me to it ... now !
professor?
you wanted to see me?
yeah .
i wanted to see you .
what happened to you?
did you pull an all nighter?
something like that .
i heard turner pulled the funding on your project .
yeah .
sorry .
thanks .
dean , i think i can help .
there's something i want to show you .
go on in .
oh , shit .
take a closer look .
what the hell is this?
i was hoping you could tell me .
i've never seen anything like it .
it's definitely organic .
all right , where did this come from?
it's a half breed .
the result of some unfortunate coupling between human and alien dna .
its flawed genes made it vulnerable to common diseases .
as a result , they're all a doomed species .
what's more , they know it .
if this thing could track me down for help , we can only assume others will be coming , too .
possibly even more desperate and dangerous .
wait .
you're not planning on just dissecting this , are you?
no .
then what?
something profound .
something that will assure my place in the pantheon of science .
yours , too , of course .
i'm talking about the engineering of a disease resistant , perfect alien species .
how?
first , we cut up our friend , then we strip out the disease prone human dna and create a pure strain of alien nucleic acids .
all those aging mediocrities in the genetics community pinning awards on each other for sequencing dna .
sequencing it !
what good is it if you don't do anything with it?
even if you've got a pure strain , you'd still have to mate it with something , right?
you're getting the idea .
let's get this thing out of here .
quietly ... and in pieces .
garbage bags in the cupboard .
i knew it .
so just what are we working on?
oh !
oh , i'm terribly sorry .
i ...
i ...
i ...
excuse the intrusion .
i ...
i didn't mean to interrupt .
i just came to see abbott .
he's not home .
well , i'll come back another time .
would you like to come inside?
why don't you look at me?
aren't i attractive?
you are by any standard ... perfect .
are you abbott's girlfriend?
housekeeper?
just a friend .
just friends .
no need to use names .
your lack of inhibition is truly inspiring .
careful !
brooks brothers !
am i asleep?
am i awake?
who the hell cares?
that's enough .
you can leave .
excuse me?
go !
shut the door on your way out .
not so fast .
moments like these don't happen every day .
i think we should go for it .
no !
it's not polite to be a prick tease !
don't you know that?
here .
let's get inside .
what is that?
it's happened .
what's happened?
sara , where are you?
what happened?
sara , where are you?
holy shit !
what the hell happened?
what the hell was he doing here?
lmpressive .
she's already quite powerful .
what are you doing?
here .
his access card might come in handy sometime .
no , no , just leave him .
we gotta call the police .
i don't think so .
you don't think so?
there's a dead man on your bedroom floor , professor !
turner had it coming for years now .
that's crazy .
you're not thinking about reporting this , are you?
yeah !
it's not murder .
she was just following instinct .
instinct? !
listen , this whole situation has gotten way out of control .
we gotta call the police immediately .
do you really think the police are gonna believe you when you tell them an alien species killed the head of your department?
if anything , they'll take a closer look at you , who recently had a very heated disagreement with the victim over your funding ... which he cut?
that's insane .
i need your help .
sara's producing eggs now .
we can build something , something amazing .
you walk away now , it's back to beakers and bunsen burners .
i like beakers and bunsen burners .
you're upset , i know .
this part of it isn't pleasant .
it's in the name of science .
in the name of science? !
you gotta give me something better than that !
the end result , the end result .
the outcome .
don't ever lose sight of what that all will mean .
i want shared credit .
what?
my name next to yours on everything we do .
agreed .
i was sure you'd turn that down .
what , and give you a graceful way out?
truth is , you don't want a way out .
not after what you've seen .
give me turner's keys .
i'll get rid of the car .
easy .
easy .
come on .
now we gotta find sara .
how?
you don't even know what she looks like at this age .
no , no .
i'll know her when i see her .
she could be anywhere .
no , she's close by .
it's saturday night ... in a college town .
mating opportunities everywhere .
damn , baby !
all right , my turn .
i always wanted a girl who could kick my ass .
how about putting a little tongue on that?
you don't want the tongue .
she's not here .
what if she doesn't come back?
she will .
how do you know?
we've accepted her , provided her with food and shelter .
you look beat .
get some sleep .
thanks .
lent day .
dear , are you all right?
honey , you must be freezing .
you got a name?
i'm colleen .
come on , let me give you a ride home .
it's okay .
it's okay .
come on .
don't feel bad .
there really aren't any good men in the world .
so what do you do?
sometimes , you settle for less .
other times , you curl up in bed with a book and a dove bar .
oh , i know .
i'm a huge sci fi geek .
all that roswell stuff?
it's real .
i'm going to a convention next month on government conspiracies .
i even know how to defend myself against alien abduction .
you do?
oh , believe me .
we are living in a world of high strangeness .
turn here !
i thought you said ...
turn !
fine .
stop !
sweetie , there's nothing out here .
what ...
where are you going?
oh , my god !
oh , my god !
what , are you crazy?
what are you doing running?
what are you doing?
oh , my god .
oh , no .
oh , my god .
god ...
oh , my god !
oh , god !
oh , god !
start !
start !
start !
okay , okay !
that's it !
okay !
okay !
just go !
asshole .
wakey , wakey , sunshine .
what time is it?
so what's her name?
who?
whoever you were out with till 3 : 00 last night .
it was nobody .
where are you going?
got to go to class .
on sunday?
hello?
listen , sorry i'm late .
my alarm clock didn't go off .
hello?
who are you?
i'm dean .
you must be sara .
how do you know my name?
because i'm working for abbott .
please let me go .
please .
you're late .
again !
sorry .
i just met sara .
she's friendly .
it's better to stay away from her as much as you can .
no reason for you two to have any unnecessary interactions .
and another thing .
she's not to be told what we're doing down here , all right?
as far as she knows , we're just observing and studying her .
the half breed's immune system is shredded .
lungs clogged with every imaginable toxin .
all of them will end up like this , i'd wager .
the same thing happen to sara?
no , no , no .
her superior dna should keep her quite healthy .
let me bring you up to speed .
from project athena , using fitch's files ,
i've done a comparative dna analysis of the three generations of alien species .
sil ... the original .
created with equal amounts human and alien dna .
it's not a bad effort , really .
this , of course , is eve ... genetic duplicate of the original .
blood chemistry was highly toxic in both subjects .
behavior unpredictable , often aggressive .
disease free .
slightly susceptible to hydrochlorine solutions .
half breeds ... first life forms created naturally , outside the lab .
mother was human , father was an astronaut infected by the alien strain ... resulting in unstable offspring riddled with disease .
evolutionary mistakes with no defense against infection .
now we have perfection .
or close to it .
with a half human mother , sara still has traces of our dna , but she is the purest species yet .
no ...
i'm going out now .
don't try to stop me .
have i stood in your way , sara?
this is your home , not a prison .
we're your friends .
do as you like .
you're not just gonna let her go out?
why not?
what about secrecy?
what about harvesting the eggs?
that's the plan , right?
certainly .
anything could happen to her out there .
what if she doesn't come back?
she came back last night , didn't she?
sara has eliminated our species as potential partners .
as a purer strain , she has no genetic partner .
plainly put , the girl can't get laid .
can you give me a hand?
hey , you know this project athena?
seems this guy , dr. fitch , already tried growing a creature from its own dna .
the thing nearly destroyed the isolation chamber before they incinerated it .
i have no intention of repeating dr. fitch's failures .
obviously , pure alien dna is too volatile on its own .
once we inject it into sara's eggs , though , her human chromosome should temper the mixture .
what about sara?
how's she gonna feel about this?
sara doesn't have any feelings .
let's get on with this .
we have a lot to do .
may i help you?
i need a room .
yes , sir .
please sign here .
something's wrong .
nothing's wrong .
there's something wrong with you ... ... a sickness .
i'm fine .
you're not fine !
you're dying !
don't turn your back on us !
hi .
sara , wait .
i wanted to show you something , if it's all right .
why don't you sit down?
what is this?
it's chess .
it's a game .
it's fun .
this is the king , and it's the most valuable piece , but it's also the most vulnerable .
and there's other pieces , and they all move .
that's the rule book , but it's long and boring .
it's easier if i just show you .
start .
what?
white moves first .
all right .
you've played before .
no .
wait , you don't mean just by picking up that book , you could ...
that's right .
you're kidding , right?
checkmate .
how can you do that?
i have to sleep now .
okay ...
listen ... maybe we could , you know , sometime ...
what happened to your hand?
it was a bunsen burner .
seen the departmental website today?
amazing !
what about it?
hi , my name's amelia , and i am looking for anyone
in an accredited biochemistry program who's recently done work in advanced dna electroporation .
jesus , look at her !
those eyes , man .
those bedroom eyes , man .
come on , she can't look like that and be a biochemist .
who cares what she is?
what are you doing?
i gotta see just how crazy this chick is .
you're an idiot .
dude , dude !
there's already an answer .
hi .
this is amelia .
get out your credit card .
she's definitely crazy ...
i'm in love .
before we speak directly .
i need to ask you a few questions .
have you done any unusual lab work in protoplastic cell suspension?
specifically .
any kind of transmembrane conductivity and permeability diffusion?
i'm looking for a man who has measured pore coefficients greater than 10e minus 16 meters squared per second .
if you're that man .
please submit some sample data in the response body of an e mail to me .
if i like what you write .
we can meet .
i promise you won't be disappointed .
okay ... that's annoying .
turn your computer off .
just turn it off .
hey !
what's your problem? !
you've been acting squirrelly for days now ... sneaking around , disappearing .
what's up?
nothing .
sir , echelon picked this up during a morning sweep .
what is it?
mass e mail .
went out to servers at every biochem program in north america .
the terminology is highly specialized .
certain key words resonate exactly with project athena .
athena .
wasn't that shut down?
i want this girl found .
yes , sir .
i've been meaning to tell you .
i think it's a big mistake for you to start having feelings for sara .
feelings?
she's just gonna break your heart .
who said i had feelings for her?
i understand the temptation , of course .
i don't have feelings for her .
listen , i know she's not attracted to humans , all right?
everything she does is only in her own biological interest .
i know this .
and listen .
do me a favor .
i'll steal equipment , i'll dissect aliens , i'll even bury bodies .
just don't give me any more dating advice .
please .
okay .
no one knows anything about this , right?
of course not .
there you are .
we need to take another blood sample .
you know the drill .
you look tense .
and your blood pressure's ... 140 .
... way up .
what's wrong?
i'd prefer it if dean took my blood .
dean?
very well .
this won't take long .
what the hell is that? !
must be another half breed .
what are you doing?
i equipped the lab with a fail safe .
hydrochloride gas .
but it's toxic to sara , too !
come on , we gotta get her !
no !
stay !
what about the project?
you can't just let her die !
it's already in here !
you already harvested her eggs?
the first night of her maturity .
she never knew .
did it under anesthesia while she slept .
that's why you let her go out .
oh , come on , look !
he's raping her !
no , dean !
no !
damn it !
go !
go !
go !
go !
get sara !
go !
go !
go !
all right , listen to me .
listen to me , all right?
you're gonna be okay , all right?
you're gonna be okay !
i doubt it .
come on .
absurd ... can't possibly end like this .
no , it's not , okay?
i'm gonna go to the e. r. come on !
i'm going to the e. r. right now !
come on !
the half breeds ... they'll keep coming .
more and more !
dangerous !
the eggs !
do it , dean ... create the new species .
do it ...
your life's in danger .
i don't understand .
you see that thing there?
that contains your eggs .
alien ova , you understand?
the half breeds need it so they can create a viable continuation of their line .
and abbott wanted it ...
abbott wanted it so he could create an even purer strain , so they'd give him the nobel prize .
i think we should just put an end to this whole little garden of eden right now .
what about me?
sara , you could have a lifespan of 400 years , for all i know .
and if i don't reproduce , the threat to your own species ends with me?
that's right .
but with the dna you've collected , you can create more like me .
sara , listen to me .
just because we can do something doesn't mean we should .
i guess this is it , doctor .
ammonium nitrate and perchloric acid .
hope you'd approve .
sara , are you in here?
we sh shouldn't do this .
don't you want me?
yeah , of course i do , but ... why do you want me?
i just do .
you're not attracted to humans .
you want something .
abbott's work was important .
the species must continue .
it's up to you .
why don't you just think of it as a simple exchange of services?
fuck it .
i can't .
it's up to you , dean .
what's up?
did you hear about abbott?
what about abbott?
he's gone , dude ... went missing .
just like dr. turner .
that's two profs in one semester .
i wonder if there's some kind of specialized serial killer out there .
so , anyway ... ... i heard back from amelia .
amelia?
yeah .
the honey on the internet?
the one who wanted the information on electroporation .
you got in touch with her?
yeah .
she liked the data .
what data?
something you wanna tell me?
what are you talking about , hastings?
you left your notebook here one day .
you went through my shit?
jesus , man , why did you do that? !
it's genetically impossible !
so what the hell is it?
look , i just ...
i can't tell you right now , all right?
i'm sorry .
she said the data was perfect .
and then she starts in with all kinds of other questions .
who was i?
where did i get it?
did i have any contact with alien life?
at that point , i'm like , " all right , the chick really is crazy .
wait a minute .
she has your e mail address .
so?
so she can find us !
so what , she's just some harmless crazy chick !
right?
what'll it be?
this is a gas station , right?
fill it up .
you sure you don't need something else?
yeah .
tell me where i can pee .
there's a women's room around the back .
check the oil , too ... unless that's too hard for you .
nice ride .
got that right .
there's no soap in here .
maybe you should file a complaint .
maybe you should get out of here .
maybe i should teach you some manners .
maybe you should .
come on .
all right .
jesus !
stop !
you're goddamn killing me !
what do you say we join the party , huh?
oh , shit !
yeah !
hell , yeah !
cobb?
cobb , you okay?
done worn him out .
i'm coming , i'm coming .
i'm amelia .
you must be hastings .
where can i go and freshen up?
so , you want a drink or something?
so ... how was your trip?
where's your lab?
lab?
i wanna see it .
i wanna see everything .
and after that , you'll get your reward .
you sure you don't wanna ...
tell me something .
where did you get your specimen from , anyway?
we never talked about that .
specimen?
something wrong?
no .
who else lives here?
no one .
just me .
okay ... look ... you know it was all a joke?
the data i sent you was fake .
i made it up .
you didn't make up that data .
now why don't you just tell me where you got it from?
i told you .
i made it up .
it seems you haven't been completely honest with me .
and from now on , that's gonna change .
i came here to get something from you , and you are gonna give it to me .
trust me , you're much better off making me happy than making me mad .
come on !
we gotta get out of the hallway !
stop !
stop !
we gotta get out of the hallway !
come on !
no !
oh , shit !
get in , dean .
it seems we still have a problem with project athena .
who are you?
how do you know my name?
what do they want?
these things?
why kidnap your roommate?
i can't be sure .
my best guess is that they need someone with scientific knowledge to help them bioengineer a new strain of species .
a new species?
yeah .
'cause the current one's about to go extinct .
and if they can't get my help , they'll get my horny roommate to do it .
we can't let 'em breed .
who'd you say you worked for?
i didn't .
look , we've been down this road before ... twice .
the two previous operations of containment resulted in a $700 million bill from the u. s. army and a six week investigation by congress .
i have neither the budget nor the stomach to go through that again .
besides , when i think of those operations , the word " overkill " comes to mind .
so you work for the government .
no , i'm a limousine driver .
unfortunately , the current administration has much less of an appetite for science fiction , shall we say?
so i'm not here in an official capacity , and we won't be taking care of this in an official capacity .
what are you gonna do?
you and i are taking care of this in an unofficial capacity .
she's probably found sara and brought hastings back to abbott's lab .
all the equipment's there for the dna cloning .
blazing in won't do us any good .
we need to figure out a weakness on sara .
you can hack into abbott's database , right?
yeah , i think so .
good .
do it .
yes , sir .
have you made any progress yet?
it's confusing , all this stuff .
maybe it's a question of focus .
now get on with it .
do you intend to kill him?
so what if he dies?
there's a college campus here .
i can find another scientist .
what are you looking at?
abbott made physiology schematics of the aliens .
we're running out of time .
i know .
any weaknesses?
the half breeds have failing immune systems , so we should be able to kill amelia with any common contaminant .
what kind of contaminant?
hydrochlorine gas .
should produce a fatal infection .
that won't work on sara .
how the hell are we gonna kill her?
where do you think you're going?
this isn't my problem .
look at me !
you might be fine now .
what about later?
you're our only hope .
it's up to you now .
your ova cells look okay .
you can see on that monitor right there .
i should be able to inject the dna directly into it .
what happens after that?
we'll have to grow it to maturity in a solution of carbon based molecules ... a membrane bag , basically .
once embryo growth has started , we just keep increasing the container size until it's developed enough to breathe air .
go ahead .
what are you waiting for?
please ... don't make me do this .
do it .
what is that?
they should be coming out soon .
this better work .
he's got my eggs !
there he is .
hey , you okay?
so ... how's things?
wonderful .
is this them?
yeah , the dna and ova cells .
all right , we got the container .
they'll follow that .
who's this guy?
my driver .
dude , you're right .
i shouldn't have sent that e mail .
just get in .
hey !
hold it right there !
i'm gonna need some time !
give me the eggs !
listen , why don't i just head on home?
let's go !
you're with me !
this way !
warning .
containment door closing .
dr. turner .
access granted .
reload password .
containment door closed .
tokamak depressurizing .
christ .
it's the eggs .
she's following the eggs .
exactly .
that's the plan .
let's go !
she's buying it .
where in the hell's dean?
he should be here !
take me to the control room .
up here !
warning .
tokamak depressurizing .
what are you guys up to , anyway?
later .
the remote's gone !
what?
he's taken control of the reactor .
it's activated !
he's lowering the pressure in the reactor room .
you better know what you're doing , dean .
who's in here?
hold it right there !
don't move !
what?
something wrong with my face?
one last thing .
warning .
tokamak depressurizing .
he's powering down the magnets !
just stick to the plan , dean .
this thing's gonna blow !
what are you talking about?
this was not part of the plan !
close the shaft , dean .
why?
if he doesn't secure the shaft , the explosion will release into the atmosphere , taking all of us with it !
what?
damn it , dean , close down the shaft !
warning .
magnetic failure .
now !
now !
now !
close the fucking shaft , dean !
magnetic ...
oh , shit !
sara , no !
oh , shit !
hold on !
i think it's over .
containment door secured .
magnets repowering .
i guess he closed the shaft .
yeah .
let's go find dean !
come on !
let's go !
we're still trying to understand the cause of the explosion .
the experimental reactor was located deep inside this power plant .
the access records show that a man named dr. nicholas turner was using the system at the time of the blast .
if he suvived it .
we'd cetainly like to talk to him .
you're awake !
yeah .
how ya feeling?
not bad .
doc says you're gonna be okay .
yeah .
oh , i brought your favorite dirty magazine .
did you see wasach on tv?
yeah ... said you should come see him sometime in washington when you're feeling better .
really?
it's all cool .
turner's taking the rap .
he even thanked us on behalf of the government .
listen , man , about this whole thing ...
i'm sorry .
i'm hungry .
you hungry?
yeah , sure .
no .
oh , no .
what are you ...
what's up?
what the hell is going on here?
i'm just doing a little cleanup .
no , i mean upstairs !
there's ...
oh , christ .
all right , just relax .
there's something i haven't told you .
come on !
you said it was over .
it is over .
she's got what she wants now .
what she ...
what did you do?
there was still some remnants of the half breed dna , so i stripped away the damaging human strains and created him .
you see , abbott's mistake was relying on sara's eggs .
after all , she couldn't mate with anything that was from her own genetic material .
so i created another one , solely from the other dna .
it's two separate lines .
well , you're on your own now , so ... be careful .
sara , wait .
that night on the catwalk , you saved my life , but your eggs were already gone .
you had no more use for me .
why'd you do it?
maybe you'll find the answer to that someday .
well , that's just great .
we go through all that , and in the end , you give her a goddamn boyfriend .
nobody should be alone , man .
you've just sentenced the world to destruction , my friend .
you realize once those two start mating ...
i didn't say he was fertile , did i?
you mean , you made him ...
sterile .
i tweaked the chromosomes before i even started .
what happens once they figure out he's sterile?
they might not take too kindly to that .
i don't know .
come on , i'll buy you breakfast .
it's my turn , anyway .
