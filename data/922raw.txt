i've had plenty of joe jobs .
nothing i'd call a career .
let me put it this way .
i have an extensive collection of name tags and hair nets .
o. k. , i still live with my parents , which i admit is both bogus and sad .
but at least i've got an amazing cable access show , and i still know how to party .
but what i'd really love is to do wayne's world for a living .
it might happen .
yeah , and monkeys might fly out of my butt .
ahh , the mirthmobile .
this is my best friend garth algar .

i just pulled over a tour bus on its way to chicago .

i recommend the sugar pucks .
they're excellent .
come on .
i'd never done a crazy thing in my life before that night .
why is it if a man kills another man in battle it's called heroic?
yet if he kills a man in the heat of passion it's called murder?
hello !

only me and garth get to talk to the camera .

a gun rack .
yeah , great .
i don't even own a gun ,
let alone many guns that would necessitate an entire rack .
what am i going to do with a gun rack?
you don't like it , fine .
wayne , if you're not careful , you're going to lose me .
i lost you two months ago .

it's at my loft .
i'm there .
i got to go .
the club owner's trying to dick me out of some money .
o. k. o. k.
see how many people i
that bass player's a babe .
she makes me feel kind of funny ,
like when we used to climb the rope in gym class .
you said i get cash up front .
she will be mine .
oh , yes .
she will be mine .
pardon me .
do you have any grey poupon?
garth , just sit there .
he's going to put that on your melon .
o. k. , but just a trim .
don't buzz me , all right?
uhh !
uhh !
uhh !
uhh !
uhh !
uhh !
oh , no !
russell , stop the tape .
so , what do you think?
i think it's two chimps on a davenport in a basement .
i'm not sponsoring this .
i got spots on love boat , but this?
what is this?
mr. vanderhoff , this is your audience .
they're the same kids that line up at noah's arcade .
it looks so cheesy .
that's where i come in .
russell's our best producer .
he does chicago p. m. with elaine ronkey ,
sunshine saturday , the african american digest .
never heard of that .
it's on very late .
it won several awards .
i think i'll stick with love boat .
if i may , speaking from a producer / director standpoint , kids can relate to this show .
these guys aren't phonies .
kids can spot phonies .
they're very smart .
kids know dick .
i watch them in my arcades .
they stand like laboratory rats hitting the feeder bar to get food pellets .
as long as they pump in quarters , who gives a shit?
let me ask you something .
what's your single biggest problem in the arcade business?
well , uh , keeping the customer informed of new product .
like , we have a new game called zantar .
zantar is a gelatinous cube that eats warriors in a medieval village .
every time it eats a chieftain you ascend to a higher level .
beauty part is you can't get to the next level .
the kids keep coughing up quarters .
gelatinous cube eats village
i think it's terrific .
you know , i know nothing about video games .
i found what you just said riveting .
well , i do my own commercials .
i did not know that .
i don't mention the games in the commercials because the technology moves much faster than the advertising .
i did not realize that .
russell , did you realize that?
no , i did not realize that .
so , mr. vanderhoff ,
let me see if i'm hearing you correctly .
are you saying that if you had a spot , say on a weekly show , that you could come on the show and update the kids on exactly what was new in your arcade?
yeah , that's it .
i'm impressed .
wow !
noah's arcade presents wayne's world .
i think that's brilliant .
brilliant .
well , thank you .
we'll get right to work on this .
we'll send the contracts over to your office .
we'll be in touch .
oh .
i'd like to think about this .
oh , of course you would .
i wouldn't have it any other way .
she'll validate .
thank you .
he's in .
stop it !
you're scaring me .
oh , cool .
you're learning cassandra's language .
i've never seen you so mental over a girl before .
you going to marry her?
marriage is punishment for shoplifting in some countries .
o. k. , you passed inspection .
all right .
just barely .
uh , o. k. , that's 42 . 57 , wayne parts and labor .
no way .
brutal .
oh , o. k. there you go .
all right , we got it .
that's not enough .
what?
we got ... that .
that's good , but i need more .
oh , man !
why don't you use a gun?
it's not my fault .
come on .
i suppose it's society's fault?
more .
cool .
all right .
here's an extra dollar .
you guys should have been at gasworks on friday .
yeah , we were there .
there was this band crucial taunt
they had this megababe for a lead singer .
unreal !
phil , we were there .
have you gone mental?
hello?
i think we should go now .
here you go .
cool !
you think it's wise to sell a show we don't own?
by tonight , we will .
ah !
excuse me .
do you know where we could find wayne campbell?
that'd be privileged information .
we just want to know where they broadcast from .
are you a friend or a relative?
we're neither .
russell , i may not have grown up around here , but i understand these people .
this must be the place .
o. k. , we're just about out of time , right?
but first let's give a wayne's world salute to the guess jeans girl claudia schiffer .
schwing !
schwing !
tent pole !
she's a babe .
she's magically babe licious .
she tested very high on the strokability scale .
mmrreowww !
ssss .
are you through yet?
i'm getting tired of holding this .
yeah , that's what she said .
o. k. , so , claudia schiffer , we salute you .
scha wing !
scha wing !
that's all the time we have this week .
until then , good night .
party on , wayne .
wayne's world wayne's world

excellent [ guitar riff ]
and ... we're clear .
o. k. excellent show , everyone .
excellent .
great show .
wayne , benjamin kane .
regional program director for oliver communications .
oh , hello .
i'm russell finley .
we spoke earlier today .
hi .
maybe we can go somewhere and get acquainted .
russell , get to know the crew .
you know anywhere nice?
hi .
hi .
let me get this out of the way
i'm a big fan .
you are?
as i see it , your show's capable of so much more .
we'll try harder , o. k.?
give us a second chance .
don't cancel us without a second chance .
garth , relax , all right?
your pills?
he can't cancel us .
we're on public access .
can i be honest?
my job , it's usually such a bore , but the other day something incredible happened .
what happened?
noah vanderhoff , owner of the largest video arcade chain in chicago , is in my office asking me what's with this show wayne's world
i hear so much about?
i have your shows on tape .
i said i'm a fan .
i put a show in .
he literally jumped out of his seat .
cool .
cool .
he wants to sponsor the show , put you on our station , and pay you a huge salary .
he doesn't realize you're both artists .
you're not interested in money .
no , we're not interested in money .
that's what i told him .
but he said take them two cashier's checks anyway so they know i'm serious .
i may be wasting my time , but here i am with the contract and two cashier's checks for $5, 000 each .
exsqueeze me?
baking powder?
you're going to pay us for doing wayne's world?
give me the word .
i'll tear up these checks .
no !
no !
he shoots , he scores !
want to look at the contracts?
yes .
do you have a lawyer?
yes .
uh ... no .
we're between lawyers right now .
our first lawyer screwed our affairs so badly .
that's right .
i walked right into that office ,
i grabbed him by his big fat head , and i said i'm not going to jail for you or anybody .
exactly .
can i have an opportunity to peruse that contract before we sign it?
hmm .
yes .
yes .
i like what you've done here .
ah .
hmm .
yes .
yes .
um , i dropped my pen .
i'm not so sure about ...
oh , i see .
i see .
hi .
um , does this seem weird?
why does this guy have contracts?
ever see the twilight zone where the guy signed a contract , they cut out his tongue , put it in a jar , and it wouldn't die?
it grew and pulsated and gave birth to baby tongues .
pretty cool , huh?
i got to go .
i like this part .
i feel we can work with you on this project .
you've made mr. vanderhoff a very happy man .
to wayne's world .
to wayne's world .

uh ...
hi , garth .
uh ... hi .
i'm looking for wayne .
he seems to be going through this difficult phase .

go out with somebody else .
get over it .
go out with somebody else .

he's interested in the band .
of course .
i love your band .
you guys wail .
thanks .
you guys kick ass .
you're double live gonzo !

ah .
cassandra ...

anytime .
look out !
aah !
aah !
oops .
sometimes i wish i could boldly go where no man's gone before , but i'll probably stay in aurora .
what are you thinking about?
cassandra .
she's a fox .
in french , she'd be called la renard .
she'd be hunted with only her cunning to protect her .
she's a babe .
she's a robo babe .
in latin , she'd be called babia majora .
if she were a president , she'd be babe raham lincoln .
did you ever find bugs bunny attractive when he'd put on a dress and play a girl bunny?
no .
no .
neither did i.
i was just asking .
o. k. , o. k. , keep looking up .

i got to go .
o. k.
no , no , no .

wayne , i used to be in meat packing .
lips and hooves .
one day , i had a four hour layover in tulsa .
these kids in the airport kept pumping quarters into a game called pong .
they must've gone through 50 bucks .
i sat there watching and said , " hell , i'm in the wrong business .
15 years later , i'm a millionaire .
it's so huge .
thanks .
do i frighten you?
no .
do you want me to?
noah , i love you on that couch .

you know , i love what you do on the show .
i look at you , and i just laugh and laugh .
uh huh .
let me run this by you because you're a sharp guy .
i'm thinking about giving vanderhoff a weekly interview on the show .
how would you feel about making a change?
we fear change .
cassandra , i have to say it
you look excellent .
thanks .
i've been so busy lately with my band ,
i thought i was getting meningitis .
i thought i had mono for an entire year .
it turned out i was just really bored .
you're so fine
you're so fine , you blow my mind
excuse me?
i'm sorry .
it's the last song i heard this morning .
i hate when that happens .
hey , mickey , you're so fine
you're so fine , you blow my mind
hey , mickey
hey , mickey
hey , mickey , you're so fine
you're so fine , you blow my mind
hey , mickey
i think i'm going to put on some tunes .
hey , when did you get the cd player?
when we got the money .
so big boy said you are bad news
we're tired of mama bein 'confused
it's plain to see we rock 'n 'roll
if you don't like it , got to move
there it is
excalibur .
wow .
'64 fender stratocaster in classic white with triple single coil pickups and a whammy bar .
pre cbs fender corporate buy out .
i'd raise the bridge , file down the nut , and take the buzz out of the low " e.
god , i love this woman .
hi , garth .
where's the clerk?
i know .
i'll use the " may i help you " riff .
may i help you?
yes , my good man .
i'd like to look at this fender stratocaster , please .
oh , really?
again?
yes .
careful .
no stairway .
denied !
wow .
you're ... amazing , dude .
thanks .
i like to play .
excuse me .
wayne .
can i put the fender back now , please?
not today , my good man .
i'm feeling saucy .
i think i'm going to buy it .
do you accept ... cash?
cha ching .
have you spoken to wayne about the vanderhoff spot?
yes .
briefly .
he was not very receptive .
oh , really?
well , i'll explain to him that it's not a choice , that it's in his contract .
oh .
well , wayne will understand that right away .
not .
excuse me .
i mean , there's two darrin stevens , right?
dick york , dick sargent .
yeah , right , as if we wouldn't notice .
well , hold on .
dick york .
dick sargent .
sergeant york .
wow , that's weird .
wayne .
listen , we need to have a talk about vanderhoff .
the fact is , he's the sponsor and you signed a contract guaranteeing him certain concessions , one of them being a spot on the show .
that's where i see things just a little differently .
contract or no , i will not bow to any sponsor .
i'm sorry you feel that way , but basically , it's the nature of the beast .
maybe i'm wrong on this one , but for me , the beast doesn't include selling out .
garth , you know what i'm talking about , right?
it's , like , people only do things because they get paid , and that's just really sad .
i can't talk about it anymore .
it's giving me a headache .
here .
take two of these .
ah .
nuprin .
little .
yellow .
different .
you can stay here in the big leagues and play by the rules or go back to the farm club in aurora .
it's your choice .
yes .
and it's the choice of a new generation .
and her name was cassandra
yeah .
anything wrong , davey?
yeah .
i got paid today .
oh , yeah , i know what that's like .
no .
you don't understand .
they laid me off .
i got one of these .
i know how that feels .
know what i'd like to do?
yeah , i know what you'd like to do
find the guy that did it , rip his still beating heart out of his chest and show him how black it is before he dies .
actually , i was thinking about filing a grievance with the union .
well , the world's a twisted place .
hi .
hey , garth .
how's it going?
good .
hey .
there she is .
aah !
i must've slipped .
wayne , um ... what do you do if every time you see this one incredible woman , you think you're going to hurl?
i say hurl .
if you blow chunks and she comes back , she's yours .
if you spew and she bolts , it was never meant to be .
oh ... i'm not ready yet .
i got to be comfortable with me first .
why don't you just go talk to her?
talk to her?
talk to her?
foxy .
foxy .
uh , you know you are a
cute little heartbreaker

you've got to be all mine

yeah .
what about when i'm in my hanging out with ravi shankar phase?
yeah .
and when i'm in my carbohydrate sequin jumpsuit , young girls in white cotton panties , waking up in a pool of your own vomit , bloated , purple , dead on a toilet phase?
yeah .

yeah .
happy birthday
mr. president

this is definitely the type of place i'm going to get when i move out of my parents 'house .
oh , you have a terrace !
yeah .
go on out .
i'll get the dom perignon .
what's goin 'on ...
what floor is this?
um ... the 23rd .
oh .
oh .
you know ...
cassandra ... from this height , you could really hawk a lugie on someone .
i feel so free up here .
costs a lot to live this free .
this might be a tangent , right , but it's something i've been thinking about ...
hi .
if i had a girl like cassandra ,
i wouldn't bring her here .
i mean , look at this place .
this is a fully functional babe lair .
chicks are helpless against its powers .
let's check it out .
i don't believe i've ever had french champagne before .
oh , actually , all champagne is french .
it's named after the region .
otherwise , it's sparkling white wine .
americans , of course , don't recognize the convention , so they call all their sparkling whites champagne , even though by definition they're not .
ah , yes .
the next generation .
in many ways , it's superior , but will never be as recognized as the original .
aha .
what's this?
how to pick up chicks .
how to meet women .
he's smooth .
aha .
daily reminder

we're not mental or anything , so don't be afraid .
we're not mental or anything , so don't be afraid .
my name is wayne , and this is garth .
ehhh ...
nice to meet you guys .
so do you ... come to milwaukee often?
well , i'm a regular visitor here , but milwaukee has certainly had its share of visitors .
the french missionaries and explorers were coming here as early as the late 1600s to trade with the native americans .
isn't milwaukee an indian name?
yes , pete , it is .
actually , it's pronounced meeleewahkay , which is algonquin for the good land .
i was not aware of that .
one of the most interesting aspects of milwaukee is the fact that it's the only major american city to have ever elected three socialist mayors .
does this guy know how to party or what?
huh?
huh?
oh .
o. k. well , we got to get going .
no .
stick around .
hang out with us .

yeah , we'll stay and hang around with youse ... with alice cooper .
we're not worthy !
we're not worthy !
we're not worthy !
we're scum !
we suck !

i really hope cassandra's watching .
oh , yeah , perfect .
whatever it costs
how's it going?
hi , guys .
well , tonight's the night .
a lot of people in the chicagoland area will be watching the show .
i already know it's going to be a hit .
i'll be in the booth .
mr. vanderhoff will be your first guest .
oh , hi , boys .

he's using the cards .
yes !
i told you he'd fall in line .
what is your most popular video game right now?
uh , desert storm commando warrior .
ha ha ha .
ha ha ha .
that would have to do with that limited skirmish in the middle east .
yes .
what the hell's he doing?
aren't there long lines for your more popular games?
well , at noah's arcade , we like to say there's two of everything , so there's never a line .
ha ha .
o. k. now , tell me , noah , i've always wanted to know
what is the difference between pac man and ms. pac man , really?
well , she has a bow on her head .
that's it?
ha ha !
ha ha !
get right out of town .
no , that's it .
heh heh .
ha ha ha !
ha ha ha !
ha ha ha !

oh , that was fun .
i'll see you next week .
i hope .
wayne , could you come to the booth , please?
oh , honey , you were incredible .
i think it went really well .
absolutely .
there was a huge response up in that little room .
those phrases were not on the cards when i gave them to him .
wayne .
what the hell is going on?
what are you doing?
same thing we always do .
you've publicly humiliated the sponsor .
yeah .
you're fired .
fired?

yeah .
right .
i'm out of here , and i'm taking my show with me .
we own the show .
aw , bite me .

uh ...
uh ...
uh ...
hello .
hello .
it's benjamin .
oh , hi .
uh , listen , did you see the show tonight?
i was working , so i only saw the first part , but i laughed my ass off .
we had some technical difficulties , and we're still playing with the format , but ... has wayne talked to you?
about what?
why?
are you canceling my video?
no .
in fact , i called to make sure we're still on .
well , we got a deal , right?
absolutely .
i'll see you in chicago .
o. k.
bye .
you really pissed me off tonight .
garth , you've never been mad at anything in your life .
but you shouldn't have walked out on the show .
i handled it o. k. , but you shouldn't walk out on your friend without telling him first .
i have to run everything by you now?
yeah , you have to run everything by me now .
what am i , some sort of chimp with you as always is garth?
jim to your marlin perkins?
you know , benjamin had you so snowed .
you know what?
he's got it for cassandra .
no way .

cassandra's not interested .
as if .

a ) chicks think he's handsome ;
b ) has cool car ; ,
c ) has lots of cash ;
d ) has no visible scars ;
e ) does not live with parents .
o. k. , how about f ) you're a gimp .
you know what you can do with your pop quiz?
you know what you can do with your show?
you can take a flying ... [ jet engine roars ]
until the handle breaks off and you have to find a doctor to pull it out again .
kiss your mother with that mouth?
you've gone mental .
i'm getting out of here , damien .
fine , then .

go , then .

i'm gone .
go , then .
i am .
where you been?
i waited up for you last night , and you never showed .
where are you going?
chicago .
benjamin set up the video shoot .
i'll be there for three days .
i guess benjamin will be there , too .
he's producing it .
and what does that mean?
he's been paying you a lot of attention lately .
well , maybe he thinks i've got some talent .
maybe he's pokin 'ya .
what?
you think that's the way i get a gig?
first he screws me , then he screws you .
it's dutch door action .
could you be any more insulting?
yeah .
i think you better leave .
fine .
i'm out of here .
oh , man .
what the hell's going on?
i lost my show , i lost my best friend ,
i lost my girl .
i'm being shit on , that's all shit on .
and do you know what really pisses me off?
where are you going?
o. k. , o. k. , come on back .
things aren't as bad as they seem .
i'm sorry .
i didn't mean to dump on you .
i'll figure something out .
o. k.?
hey , mr. doughnuthead man , who's trying to kill you?
i don't know , but they better not .
if you stab a man in the dead of winter , steam will rise up from the wounds .
that's not good !
i'm not happy !
oh , no !
indians believed it was his soul escaping from his body .
right , glen .
reee !
reee !
reee !
reee !
reee !
reee !
reee !
reee !
reee !
reee !
reee !
reee !
reee !
reee !
hi .
hi .
i'm sorry about what i did ...
buds?
buds .
officer kuharski .
damn shame how they screwed up your show .
it was a nice little program .
not that i ever watched it .
here you go .
so , uh , how you doing?
'k. , s'pose .
just wish i had cassandra back .
she's in chicago shooting a video with " bun ja mun .
so , uh ... [ slurping ]
what are you going to do?
i don't know .
i do have one plan .
what are you going to do with these guys?
oh , nothing , really .
i just always wanted to open a door to a room where people are being trained
like in james bond movies .
wicked .
i think you should just go get cassandra .
i just don't think she wants me to .
let me tell you a little something
i've learned about women .
they want you to come get them .
they love it .
i just wish there was something i could offer her that benjamin couldn't .
you'll think of something .
wait a minute .
no .
wait a minute .
hmm .
wait a minute !
i know
the guy in the limo , mr. big , the owner of sharp records .
if we could just get him to listen to cassandra play .
halt .
halt .
the security guard at the concert said
mr. sharp was driving back through chicago on friday .
that's right .
wow .
aren't we lucky we were there to get all that information?
it seemed extraneous at the time .
o. k. , first i'll access the secret military spy satellite that's in a geosynchronous orbit over the midwest .
then i'll i. d. the limo by the vanity plate " mr. biggg " and get its position .
then i'll reposition the transmitter dish in the remote truck to 17 . 32 degrees east , hit westar 4 over the atlantic , bounce the signal down into the azores , up to comsat 6 , beam it back to satcom 3 transponder 137 , and down to the dish on mr. big's limo .
it's almost too easy .
we can only pray he's watching television in his limo at that exact moment .
we'll need help .
we'll help .
we'll help .
you get cassandra !
we'll do the rest !
to the mirthmobile !
yeah !
whoo !
whoo !
o. k. , this is a take , everybody .
i think the snake fell asleep !
uh ...
playback !
looking good .
ain't got no reason for reaction
no
ain't got no reason for distraction
i love the way that you love me , baby
love the way that you stare
ooh , the way that you tease me , baby
ooh , touch me
yeah
touch me
this snake weighs a ton .
it looks great on you .
i'm coming down now .
i'm telling you , you're hot .
yes , officer?
is there something wrong?
have you seen this boy?
aah !
aah !
you know , you're exactly right .
why leave the hotel?
we'll have dinner sent up , you can have a hot bath , and i'll make some calls .
cassandra !
we have to talk .
i don't want to talk to you .
i don't want to talk to you .
i've set up an audition for your band .
my show's coming back .
you've got to be on it .
go home .
i'm not going anywhere .
cassandra , i love you .
you may not believe it , but i love you .
am i supposed to just turn my back and leave?
am i supposed to be a man?
am i supposed to say ,
that's o. k. i don't mind .
i don't mind .
well , i mind !
i mind big time !
and you know what the worst part of all is?
i never learned to read .
is that true?
yes .
everything except the reading part .
very nice speech , wayne .
we're very busy .
of course .
her music video .
very clever .
but where is her band?
hi , wayne .
hi , wayne .
oh , hi , guys .
i didn't see you there .
well , i guess you've thought of everything , huh?
nothing left for me to do but just go home .
bye bye , wayne .
it's bedtime .
but both you and i know that there is no film in this camera .
jimmy !
wayne ... go home .
sometimes people outgrow one another .
it's very sad , but you can't let it drag you down .
is that you ... or the snake?
campbell , wait up !
cassandra , i know i don't have his looks ,
i know i don't have his money ,
i know i don't have his connections , his knowledge of fine wines ,
i know sometimes when i eat
i get this clicking sound in my jaw
shut your yap and get in the car .
excellent .
that's right , girl .
mr. big's limousine is right where we want it .
impossible plays ]
gentlemen , this is it .
let's go .
down now !
wait up , guys .
i fell on my keys .
ow !
ow !
ow !
ow !
freeze !
oh , hi , russell .
how's it going?
hold it right there .
hey !
hey !
watch where you're pointing that thing .
give me the flashlight , russell .
you can help us , russell .
no !
i'm supposed to stop you .
w w what are you going to do , be benjamin's monkey boy the rest of your life?
benjamin's my friend .
no .
benjamin is no one's friend .
if benjamin were an ice cream flavor , he'd be pralines and dick .
it's o. k.
he's going to be ...
o. k.
hi .
hi .
how's it going?
i love you , man .
i know .
no , you don't .
i ... love you , man .
i know .
just say thank you .
hey !
thank you .
all right .
i understand you're doing your job , but i'm very late .
would you mind placing your hands on the hood , son?
there's just one other thing i've got to check .
wayne's world , wayne's world
party time
excellent [ guitar riff ]
o. k , this is a special wayne's world , o. k.?

let's just see who you really are , mister .
it's old man withers , the guy who runs the haunted amusement park !
i would have got away with it if it hadn't been for you snooping kids !

i love you , wayne .
i love you , cassandra .
i love you , garth .
i love you , dreamwoman .
you know , ever since i did your show , kids are looking at me in a whole new way .
i love you , man .
and i love you , because i've learned that platonic love can exist between two grown men .
and i've learned something , too .
i've learned that a flawless profile , a perfect body , the right clothes , and a great car can get you far in america almost to the top but it can't get you everything .
isn't it great that we're all better people?
fishnet !

we hope you found it entertaining , whimsical and yet relevant , with an underlying revisionist conceit that belied the film's emotional attachments to the subject matter .
i just hope you didn't think it sucked .
