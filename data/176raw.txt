whatever the hell you call it .
don't get touchy , porter .
what's his name?
val resnick .
oh , that son of a bitch .
you know him?
yeah .
i met up with him once a few years ago .
he can't use star service anymore ... because he beats up all the girls ... and he almost killed one .
you?
does it matter?
you quit looking after me , remember?
would you happen to have a line ... on where he might be?
i suppose he's at the hotel .
which one?
the outfit hotel .
they're all there .
you got an address?
we're friends , right?
i mean , we used to be .
but i'm an employee , too , and i don't think the outfit ... would like me telling you where the hotel was , would they?
no .
what do you think i'm gonna do?
how strong are you , porter?
personally , i think you are the strongest man ...
i have ever met .
but i wonder if it's enough .
for what?
lf i know you ... you want this resnick guy for something he won't like .
yeah , i'm gonna kill him .
that's something he won't like .
what if something goes wrong , and they grab you ... and they ask you where you found out about the hotel?
why are we even talking about this?
you know i wouldn't turn you in .
i wouldn't talk about who told me what .
but what if they ask you hard?
i'll i'll tell them it was a cab dispatcher named stegman .
the oakwood arms , union and 17th .
hi , val .
where's my money?
no , it's not there .
i took your gun .
it's back here .
you look like a pro .
you keep your mouth shut ... and you'll walk out of here .
my 70 grand i want it .
i don't have it right now .
where is it?
i gave all 130, 000 to the outfit .
i gave it all to them .
well ... tell them you gave them money that doesn't belong to you ... and get it back .
now , porter , i can't do that .
i mean , you don't know these guy
you're gonna kill me whether i get the money or not .
all right , i'll get it .
i'll get the money .
just give me a few days , all right?
what the fuck are you doing?
noon .
tomorrow .
say it .
all right .
you know , this may sound crazy , porter ... but , uh , no hard feelings , huh?
i did what i had to do .
you could appreciate that .
yeah , i appreciate that , you
no , no , no .
don't .
please .
allow me .
jesus .
god .
god .
you bitch !
let her work .
me love you , baby .
me love you long ... time .
wait up , hon .
wait .
tomorrow .
noon .
you and the money ... be at the corner of 7th and franklin ... at the pay phone .
ok .
ok .
where'd you get this?
hmm?
some hooker had it on her shelf .
i recognized you .
i swiped it in case i could use it .
did you hurt her?
huh?
the hooker did you hurt her?
what does that have to do with anything?
i've got a few minutes .
so go boil an egg .
uhh !
philip tells me you have a problem ... you need help with .
yes , sir .
ls it your problem who breached our security ...
last night at the oakwood?
yes , sir .
ahem .
then he breaks into my apartment
there's an old expression ... that has served me well .
do not shit where you eat .
or " live .
do not shit where you live .
yeah , i like that better .
i'm sorry .
i'm sorry , mr. carter .
there are 3 ways that we can handle this .
1 we can help you .
2 we can allow you to help yourself .
and 3 we can have you replaced .
we have an investment in you , resnick ... of time , money , and training ... so assisting you would be , in a way ... protecting our investment .
and that is always good business policy .
yes , sir .
yes , sir , mr. carter .
thank you , sir .
you won't regret it .
now ... according to philip ... a man has come to town to kill you?
yes .
and you say that he's alone ... and that he's a professional robber ... is that correct?
yes , sir .
he does payroll jobs , banks ... you know , stuff like that .
mm hmm .
what's his name?
porter .
well , what's his first name?
you know , i don't know it .
he never called himself anything but porter .
mmm .
where did you get the $130, 000?
that's why this man has come to town , huh?
the $130, 000 that you paid us back?
yes , sir , but only 70, 000 of it was his .
well , we never asked you where you got the money .
it's none of our business ... but now it appears it has become our business .
here's his file , mr. carter .
do you understand your value ... to the organization , resnick?
you're a sadist .
you lack compunction .
that comes in handy .
but now you've allowed an area ... of your personal life to become a danger to us .
a man in our organization needs to be tough ... and self reliant .
were you to handle this problem on your own ... there would be no doubt ... that you're the kind of man we want .
i want to .
ahem .
i want to handle it myself , mr. carter .
great .
until the matter is handled ...
i want you to move out of the oakwood arms .
uh , ahem , but i don't have a place , uh
i don't want anymore unpleasantness at the hotel .
yes , sir .
excuse me for saying so , mr. carter ... but it might be easier if resnick just disappeared .
i thought about that ... but i'm not worried about resnick .
he wouldn't last 2 minutes out on the street without us .
it's that other mutt i'm thinking about .
what's his name?
porter .
takes a lot of moxie to walk right into the outfit ... and start whacking our guys around .
either that , or he's shit nuts .
frankly , i don't understand it for $130, 000 .
70, 000 .
his share .
that's even worse .
i don't want mr. bronson hearing about this .
he'll think i'm getting soft .
one of his principles has always been ...
lf you don't understand it , get rid of it .
a stitch in time , so to speak , so ... stitch this mutt up , phil .
any polaroids or trophies?
no , not this time .
yeah?
they cut me loose , pearl .
just like i thought they would .
hold on one second .
shut up !
i'm on the fucking phone !
yes?
did your friends make it to town?
oh , yeah .
last night , baby .
good .
now , did you tell them ... it was porter took their payroll?
i did .
and they want retribution .
all right .
all right , here's what we do .
ho ho .
yeah , that's porter .
he's shit for brains .
oh , shit .
shit !
next time , porter .
looks like porter's made some new friends .
easy , mister .
i'm ok .
i don't want to press charges .
who were they , huh , pal?
i don't know .
i don't know .
oh , man .
oh , it's you guys .
our buddy stegman says you got a line ... on a load of cash there , porter .
250 grand , to be exact .
70 .
come on , man .
get off of me .
all right , all right , all right .
what do you take us for , huh?
ldiots?
nobody'd go through all this shit for 70 grand .
we don't like trouble , buddy .
you look like a whole bunch of trouble to us .
we found a dead girl full of heroin .
there were signs of a struggle ... and the coroner's not so sure it was an o. d.
we got a witness , though .
a guy with only one nostril .
remember him?
uh huh .
hey , don't worry , porter .
we're gonna give you immunity .
room to operate , " get out of jail free " card .
all you got to do is get the money .
oh , we can't help you , though .
it'd be against the law .
you understand , porter?
it's my money .
wrong , porter .
huh?
it's our money , porter .
me and my partner's money .
you be a good boy , we'll give you a piece .
we'll be easy , porter .
you got it?
yeah , he's got it .
you understand?
you take it easy , huh?
we'll be in touch .
sure , thanks .
what a dope .
fuck .
crooked cops .
did they come any other way?
lf i had been just a little dumber ...
i could have joined the force myself .
jesus christ , porter ... you need to see a doctor .
yeah .
it's gonna sting .
just clean it up , all right?
you hold it there .
yeah , right .
i'll do it .
tell me something , porter .
when did you decide to leave?
was it that night we slept together?
no .
it was the next day when i had to drive you to work .
you could have asked me to quit .
you could have asked me to drive you somewhere else .
hubba hubba hubba .
thanks .
does it fit?
oh , yeah ...
like it was made for me .
it'll look great in your casket .
you know what i think?
i think that , uh ... all those stories about you being dead were true .
you're just too thick headed to admit it .
porter .
god , i missed you .
i missed you .
don't talk .
don't .
oh , no , i ...
i can't .
i got , uh ... stuff to do .
i got ...
ahem .

nobody knows i'm here .
sit down .
relax .
what?
nobody has this number .
what?
somebody does know i'm here .
he's probably fucking her .
hmmph .
he's taking long enough .
maybe the dog , too .
you think so?
give it a minute .
ok , let's give him another bell .
shit .
he's behind us .
oh !
aah !
aah !
it's not just anybody that gets a hit put on them ... by a big firm like the outfit .
i was moving up in the world .
maybe it was time to pay them a visit .
carter wouldn't be expecting that .
and who knows ...
i might even get my money back .
told you he'd show up .
give me my goddamn money , please .
fuck .
give me my money , too .
give me my goddamn money , please .
sure that's him?
yeah .
that's him .
come on .
thank you very much .
thank you .
hey , fellas .
what you up to , buddy?
well , our money's in there ... if you're still interested .
well , not in the dough , but , uh ... the boat i'm gonna buy with it .
huh .
what's he doing here?
it's a ride along , porter .
see , your piece of the pie just got a little smaller .
but don't worry , i'll leave you some crust .
what are you waiting for , porter?
go get it .
go get our money .
you guys do me a favor?
we're here to help , buddy .
they're probably gonna frisk me when i go in there ... so i wonder if you wouldn't mind holding on to this .
jesus .
you know , just for a little while .
sure , porter .
hey .
nice balance .
douche bag .
hmmph .
can i help you?
yeah .
i wanna see mr. carter .
and who are you?
tell him i'm the guy that whacked val resnick .

didn't copy .
repeat .
right .
mr. carter will see you .
uh , turn around so i can frisk you .
bravo .
sit down .
my compliments .
they were 2 of my best .
didn't know how they'd lull too easy .
there's something you want from me .
val resnick gave you $130, 000 .
paid us .
it was a debt . $70, 000 is mine .
i want it back .
i'm sorry .
resnick told me ... but i seem to have misplaced your name .
porter .
porter .
right .
i won't forget it again .
the outfit is not unreasonable , porter ... but no corporation in the world ... would agree to what you're asking .
what about fairfax?
will he give me my money?
resnick told you quite a bit , didn't he?
fairfax will tell you the same thing i have .
we're not authorized to do things like this .
who is?
who makes the decisions?
a committee would make a decision in this case .
no .
one man .
you go high enough , you come to one man .
who?
yes .
mr. bronson ...
i have mr. carter on the line .
put him through .
go ahead , sir .
hey , carter , how's business?
you wanted to see me , dad?
pretty good up till now .
hang on , carter .
look in that green box , johnny .
oh ...
are you kidding me?
ha ha ! ls it the convertible?
you thought i forgot , didn't you?
whoo !

you kidding me?
this car ... and nick's got us ringside ... at the championship fight tonight .
gonna be a good one , too .
my money's on rankin .
no , i don't think so .
i think hicks is favored .
that's got nothing to do with it , son .
well , i gotta get going .
thanks .
happy birthday .
drive safe !
you got it , dad !
sorry , carter .
what is it?
i have a problem .
there's a man in my office with a gun ... who says that he's going to kill me ... if we don't pay him back $130, 000 ... that one of our lieutenants stole from him .
70, 000 .
it's 70
how much is this guy carter worth to you?
what do you mean?
either i get my money , or i'll kill carter .
are you threatening me?
i'm not threatening you , i'm threatening carter .
an audacious man .
who are you?
uh , heh ... my money yes or no?
no .
carter?
oh .
carter?
carter? !
what's going on there?
you just don't get it , do you , you dumb fuck?
carter , talk to me .
carter !
call fairfax and tell him i just croaked carter .
and he's next .
and after that , i'm coming to get you .
are you out of your fuckin 'mind?
you just dug your own grave .
i don't see any cash .
they write you a check?
they gave me the run around .
i have to go and see another guy .
last one , then we got a dead woman , an assault ... and all kinds of stuff to talk to you about .
that means more paperwork , porter ... and we don't like paperwork .
damn shame , porter .
don't let the bastards get you down .
that's right , porter .
don't give up .
hey , can i have my piece back?
oh , yeah .
nice roscoe , porter .
heavy enough to be a nutcracker .
we'll be in touch , rocky .
keep up the good work !
nobody likes a monkey on their back .
i had 3 ... and they were cramping my style .
i was gonna have to lighten the load .
porter .
where have you been?
i've just been taking care of business .
you know , evening up the odds a little .
these guys aren't gonna stop until they kill us ... are they?
no .
i'm sorry .
sorry i got you involved in this .
so why did you?
you're a clever guy .
you didn't need me .
so why did you?
yeah , you're right .
when i came back ...
i came back here with nothing .
no life .
no hope .
you were the only good thing in my life ... that hadn't been taken from me .
i couldn't stay away .
i had to see you ... just to make sure i wasn't in hell .
so why don't we get out of here?
we can't .
why?
well , you said it .
they're not gonna stop until they bury us .
so ...
so we bury them first .
i should've quit .
i should've driven you somewhere else .
hey , look .
hey , look .
whoa .
that's me !
that's me !
happy birthday , johnny .
what's next?
you're the man .
you're totally the man .
this is your night .
hey , johnny .
i'm your birthday present .
who is that?
you sons of bitches .
yes !
we didn't do it .
we had nothing to do with this .
dude , she's so hot .
get her .
she's so fine .
go !
go !
can you believe this guy?
dad's really hooking him up , isn't he?
boy , you are cute , aren't you?
you must have some pretty wonderful friends , johnny .
wealthy , too , 'cause i'm not cheap .
don't wait up , boys .
i promise he won't be home before midnight .
see you , man !
damn !
mmm .
that's a good boy .
ok .
yeah , right there .
relax .
who's the professional here , johnny?
so go with it .
i promise you won't regret it .
there , baby .
hello .
relax , kid .
no one will get hurt .
get hurt?
what's he talking about?
shh .
good to have you back in town ...
mr. fairfax .
i wish i could say i was glad to be back .
i was swimming with the dolphins this morning .
easy , would you?
it's genuine alligator , for god's sake !
what's the matter with you?
sorry , mr. fairfax .
hello , mr. fairfax .
how's it going , charlie?
porter and fairfax .
i bet that'll be a short conversation .
well , between us and our neighborhood cops ...
i'd say we got him pretty well covered , huh?
walter , wake up .
walter !
wake up !
keep those bags up , boys .
come on .
who the hell are you?
i'm the reason you're home early ...
mr. fairfax .
you're porter?
that's it .
keep them up , boys , at shoulder level .
drop them , and i'll drill you .
well , what'll you have me do ... stand on my head?
no .
i want you to do me a favor .
call mr. bronson ... see what we can do about getting my money back .
well ... he let carter die .
but that poor buck toothed bastard's ... probably better off dead anyway .
he'd probably let me die , too .
no , with carter , he thought i was bluffing .
try him .
you might find him more receptive than you think .
all right .
you two are fired .
hello .
well , it's like this ...
i'm standing in my living room ... and there's a man here named porter ... who says that he expects you ... to pay him sooner or later .
yes , of course .
he wants to talk to you .
put it on the speaker .
this is porter .
you got balls , porter .
you're proving to be a real pain in the ass ... a mosquito .
to get rid of you , i'll swat you with 130 grand .
ah .
it's not 130
hey , what the hell are you doing , man?
fairfax?
fairfax .
yes .
oh , it's all right .
he's just killing my alligator bags ... and shooting holes in my suits .
that's just mean .
that's mean , man .
you people aren't listening .
it's not 130 gr
no , you listen .
i'll get you your money ... but you're never gonna live to enjoy it .
you let me worry about that .
here's the deal .
i want you to deliver the money yourself .
you're one hell of an optimist .
what in the world makes you think ...
i'm gonna deliver the money myself?
well , if you don't ... you'll never see little johnny again .
didn't come home from the fight last night ... did he?
he's a good looking kid ... but you indulge him too much .
i told him so .
bullshit .
you haven't got him .
you wouldn't be that stupid .
my dad never bought me a ferrari .
i had to steal my first one .
nice inscription on the key chain .
a little sappy .
want me to read it?
you're dead , porter .
nobody fucks with my family .
you hear me?
you're a dead man .
that's johnny , mr. bronson ... unless you turn up with the money .
ls that a yes?
hmm?
what's the matter , cat got your crotch?
some decisions are hard , mr. bronson .
where?
i'll let you know .
i'll be in touch .
you just signed your own death warrant ... for $130, 000 .
i don't i don't get that .
what is it?
the principle or something , huh?
stop it .
i'm getting misty .
and tell him it's 70 , will you?
70?

too late now .
he doesn't wanna say anything .
he just wants to get himself beat up ... that's all .
here it is .
130, 000 .
that's as close ... as you're ever gonna get to it ... but i'll make you a deal .
tell me where john is ... and i'll finish you quick .
i promise you won't have to find out ... what your left ball tastes like .
but if there's even a bruise on him ...
i'll make this last 3 weeks .
i'll give you a blood transfusion ... to keep you alive if i have to .
where is he?
i'm waiting .
this little piggy went to the market .
