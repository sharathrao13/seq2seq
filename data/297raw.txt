in the first years of the 21 st century ... ... a third world war broke out .
those of us who survived knew mankind could never survive ... a fourth ... that our own volatile natures could simply no longer be risked .
so we have created a new arm of the law ...
... the grammaton cleric , whose sole task it is to seek out and eradicate the true source of man's inhumanity to man .
his ability ... to feel .
police !
you know what to do .
get down !
we have an unknown number barricaded in the southeast end of the compound .
read that .
tetragrammaton team en route .
cleric , lights out .
maybe more than a dozen inside .
when the door's down , blow the bulbs .
yes , sir .
go .
where is he?
shut up .
anybody get him?
did anybody hit him?
shut up !
listen .
this is it .
where?
there .
it's real .
burn it .
why didn't you just leave it for the evidentiary team to collect and log?
they miss things sometimes .
and i thought i'd take it down myself ... get it done properly .
how long , preston , till all this is gone?
till we've burned every last bit of it?
resources are tight .
we'll get it all eventually .
libria ...
i congratulate you .
at last ... peace reigns in the heart of man .
at last , war is but a word whose meaning fades from our understanding .
at last ... we ... are ... whole .
librians ... there is a disease in the heart of man .
its symptom is hate .
its symptom ... is anger .
its symptom is rage .
its symptom ... is war .
the disease ... is human emotion .
but , libria ...
i congratulate you .
for there is a cure for this disease .
at the cost of the dizzying highs of human emotion , we have suppressed its abysmal lows .
and you as a society have embraced this cure .
prozium .
now we are at peace with ourselves , and humankind is one .
war is gone .
hate , a memory .
we are our own conscience now .
and it is this conscience that guides us to rate ec 1 0 for emotional content all those things that might tempt us to feel again ... and destroy them .
librians , you have won .
against all odds and your own natures ... you have survived .
every time we come from the nethers to the city , it reminds why we do what we do .
it does?
i beg your pardon .
it does .
the following items have been rated ec 1 0 ... condemned ... seven works of two dimensional illustrated material , seven discs of musical content , 20 interactive strategy computer programs .
seven works of two dimensional ...
thank you for coming , cleric .
i assume you know who i am .
yes , sir .
of course .
you are vice council dupont of the third conciliarly of the tetragrammaton ...
father's voice .
quite frankly , cleric ,
i am told that you are very nearly a prodigal student , knowing almost instantly if someone is feeling .
i have a good record , sir .
why , do you imagine , that is , cleric?
i'm not sure , vice council .
somehow ...
i'm able , on some level , to sense how an offender thinks , to ... put myself in their position .
if you had ceased your interval , if you were a sense offender ...
i suppose you could say that , sir .
you're a family man , cleric?
yes , sir ... a boy and a girl .
the boy's in the monastery himself , on path to becoming a cleric .
good .
and the mother?
my spouse was arrested and incinerated for sense offense four years ago , sir .
by yourself?
no , sir ... by another .
how did you feel about that?
i'm sorry .
i don't ... fully understand , sir .
how did you feel?
i didn't feel anything .
really?
how is it that you came to miss it?
i ...
i've asked myself that same question , sir .
i don't know .
a nearly unforgivable lapse , cleric .
i trust you'll be more vigilant in the future .
yes , sir .
every time we come from the nethers to the city , it reminds why we do what we do .
it does?
every time we come from the nethers to the city , it reminds why we do what we do .
it does?
it does .
prosecutorial evidence for a. n. r. 1 36890 .
i need it .
it was late this afternoon .
may not have showed up in the records yet .
i'm very sorry , cleric .
nothing has been logged and nothing is pending under that entry .
it was an item of evidence brought in personally by grammaton errol partridge .
check again .
sir , cleric partridge has not entered anything in for weeks .
you're mistaken .
it was a book of some kind .
cleric ...
... there's nothing .
thank you .
he's been passing through the gate into the nether every night for the last two weeks .
we assumed it was enforcement related .
you always knew .
but i , being poor ... have only my dreams .
i have spread my dreams under your feet .
tread softly ... because you tread on my dreams .
i assume you dream , preston .
i'll do what i can to see they go easy on you .
we both know ... they never go easy .
then i'm sorry .
no , you're not .
you don't even know the meaning .
it's just a ... vestigial word for a feeling you've never felt .
don't you see , preston?
it's gone .
everything that makes us what we are ... traded away .
there's no war .
no murder .
what is it you think we do?
no .
you've been with me .
you've seen how it can be ... the jealousy , the rage .
a heavy cost .
i'd pay it gladly .
don't .
you and your partner were close?
i hope you're as pleased to be assigned me as i am the placement .
i was told this would be a career making advancement .
i'm like you , cleric ... intuitive .
sometimes i know when a person's feeling before they know it themselves .
cleric ...
i can only hope one day to be as ... uncompromising as you .
good night .
the later 20th century saw the fortuitous and simultaneous rise of two synergistic political and psychological sciences .
the first , the revolutionary precept of the hate crime .
john?
yes?
i saw robbie taylor crying today .
he didn't know , but i saw .
do you think i should report him?
unquestionably .
... a single inescapable fact ... that mankind united with infinitely greater purpose in pursuit of war ... than he ever did in pursuit of peace .
but i , being poor ... have only my dreams .
i have spread my dreams under your feet .
tread softly ... because you tread on my dreams .
don't move !
don't move !
comply !
comply !
stop !
stop where you are !
get down !
get down !
don't shoot .
this is a lawful entry .
we have a warrant for your wife's arrest .
she's charged with sense offense .
hey !
get her !
get her off him now !
remember me .
libria ...
awake .
awaken to triumph again in the face of yet another day , another step in our unified march
into the unwavering purpose ...
... move ahead together into the certainty of our collective destiny .
what are you doing?
i said , what are you doing?
i accidently dropped my ... morning interval .
i took it out before i brushed my teeth .
i never take it out before i brush my teeth .
then you'll go by equilibrium , log the loss , and get a replacement .
yes .
of course .
your new partner called .
he says he'll pick you up at 1 0 : 00 for the a. n. r.
i hope you don't mind .
i took the liberty of telling him you would be at equilibrium , replacing your dose .
no , of course not .
that was the right thing to do .
stop that .
due to terrorist activity , this site is temporarily closed .
proceed to the equilibrium center in sector 8a .
due to terrorist activity , this site is temporarily closed .
this site is temporarily closed .
proceed to the equilibrium center in sector 8a .
more than punctual , cleric .
hop in .
how were the lines?
i'm surprised you were able to get your interval and get out so quickly .
no , they're ... they're fine today .
maybe i'll drop by later , get my interval adjusted .
you expecting resistance?
that's something you'll find about me , cleric .
i'm a wary person , cautious by nature .
always expecting the worst .
you can't do this .
you cannot do this .
tetragrammaton .
there's nothing we can't do .
how long have you been off the dose?
look at you .
look at you !
look at you .
the mirror's frame is illegal .
destroy it .
we have suppression .
we're making entry .
standard deployment .
collecting catalog .
illegal articles .
you're gonna burn it , aren't you?
eventually .
however , you couldn't have accumulated all this by yourself .
it'll all be sorted and examined .
we'll discover who your confederates are .
gun !
we need her .
what's your name?
o'brien , mary .
well , mary ... you can either wait and tell the technicians at the palace of justice ... or you can tell me now .
who are your friends?
i'm wondering if you have any idea at all what that word means ...
friend .
there's nothing you don't feel?
how about guilt?
let me ask you something .
why are you alive?
i'm alive ...
i live ... ... to safeguard the continuity of this great society .
to serve libria .
it's circular .
you exist to continue your existence .
what's the point?
what's the point of your existence?
to feel .
'cause you've never done it , you can never know it .
but it's as vital as breath .
and without it ... without love , without anger , without sorrow ... breath is just a clock ticking .
then i have no choice but to remand you to the palace of justice for processing .
processing .
you mean execution , don't you?
processing .
the gun katas .
through analysis of thousands of recorded gunfights , the cleric has determined that the geometric distribution of antagonists in any gun battle is a statistically predictable element .
the gun kata treats the gun as a total weapon , each fluid position representing a maximum kill zone , inflicting maximum damage on the maximum number of opponents while keeping the defender clear of the statistically traditional trajectories of return fire .
by the rote mastery of this art , your firing efficiency will rise by no less than 1 20 % .
the difference of a 63 % increase to lethal proficiency makes the master of the gun katas an adversary not to be taken lightly .
without love ... breath is just a clock ... ticking .
prozium ... the great nepenthe .
opiate of our masses .
glue of our great society .
salve and salvation , it has delivered us from pathos , from sorrow , the deepest chasms of melancholy and hate .
with it , we anesthetize grief , annihilate jealousy , obliterate rage .
that those sister impulses towards joy , love , and elation are anesthetized in stride , we accept as fair sacrifice .
for we embrace prozium in its unifying fullness and all that it has done to make us great .
good morning , cleric .
good morning . ... intrinsically , humans , as creatures of the earth were drawn inherently always back to one thing ... war .
and thus we seek to correct not the symptom but the disease itself .
we have sought to shrug off individuality , replacing it with conformity .
replacing it ... with sameness ... with unity , allowing each man , woman , and child in this great society to lead identical lives .
the concept of identical environment construction allows each of us to head confidently into each moment with all the secure knowledge it has been lived before .
what are you doing?
i'm rearranging my desk .
you didn't like the way it was before?
i had no feelings about it .
i'm merely attempting to optimize .
sense offenders holed up in the nether .
we estimate ... we estimate 50 men , sir .
intelligence tells us they're all fully armed .
this is the group that bombed the prozium factories .
you clean , we'll sweep .
yes , sir .
go !
go !
go !
go !
go !
aah !
take it !
take the landings !
aah !
aah !
cover me .
i'm going in .
aaaaaaaah !
nice grab , cleric .
ludwig van beethoven .
cleric ...
why didn't you leave that for the evidentiary team to collect and log?
they miss things sometimes .
i'll take it in myself ... make sure it gets done properly .
you know , preston ...
if we keep burning all this contraband , eventually there won't be anything left to burn .
what'll there be for men like us?
sir !
we got something out back .
we're gonna need two more men on this .
these animals were defended by women and children .
we put them down easily .
this isn't the first time we've seen this .
why do they keep these animals?
what , do they ... do they eat them?
what do you want me to do , sir?
exterminate them , of course .
all right .
let's do it .
no .
what's wrong , cleric?
nothing .
hey ...
grab it .
grab it !
sir ... toss it back in .
i'll finish it off .
give it to me , sir .
give it to him , cleric .
he'll finish it .
wait !
it seems to me that ... at least some of these animals ought to be tested for disease .
if there's an epidemic in the nether , it's best we know about it .
i don't quite follow your logic , cleric .
they were resistance .
they could have led us to the underground .
but instead of apprehension and interrogation , they were slaughtered .
yes , but , cleric , given the circumstances , the father has decreed that there will be no more " process " for sense offenders .
they are either to be shot on sight or incinerated without a trial .
but it's counter to law .
you're a member of the council .
if ...
it is not the will of the council , it is the will of father ... and he is law .
sir ... without the logic of process , is it not just mayhem ... what we have worked so hard to eradicate?
you must understand , preston , that while you ... and even i ... may not always agree with it , it is not the message that is important , it is our obedience to it .
father's will .
call it faith .
you have it , i assume?
yes .
i have it .
good .
confiscated evidence x23 t45 ...
mary o'brien .
cleric john preston passing into the nether ... enforcement related .
thank you , sir .
i don't know what else to do with you .
go on .
go on .
go !
fine .
but you're going back in the trunk .
okay .
here .
step away from the vehicle !
step away from the vehicle !
this is your last warning !
step away from the vehicle !
identification .
i'm a cleric .
i'm here on official business .
identification !
it's in my coat .
where's the coat?
where is it? !
i don't have it .
unidentified individuals are subject to summary destruction .
you're making a very big mistake .
i'm a grammaton cleric , first class .
we're gonna search your vehicle .
no , you're not .
there's nothing in it .
search it !
clear , sir .
keys to the trunk .
i'm trying to tell you .
i have a predawn combustion to witness .
i'm not ...
captain , this is a waste of my time .
my name is john preston .
i'm the highest ranking cleric of the tetragramm ...
wait .
stand off .
i'm sorry i didn't recognize you , sir .
that's okay .
just doing your job .
thank you .
we'll escort you back to the gate .
thanks .
animals .
nether's full of them .
sounds like it came from your trunk .
impossible .
just give me my keys .
i'll be on my way .
captain ...
i'm asking you one last time ... don't do this .
down on your knees !
down on your knees !
down on your knees !
drop down !
on the ground !
comply !
do it !
no .
fuck !
what?
aw , shit !
shoot him !
shoot him !
shoot him !
aah !
always practicing , cleric .
i guess that's why you're the best .
maybe i'm just better .
something on your mind?
why do you ask?
the intuitive arts , cleric .
it's my job to know what you're thinking .
so , then ... what am i thinking?
about the murders in the nether last night ...
and if they know who did it .
am i close?
so , tell me ... do they know?
there are theories .
i have one or two of my own , but at the moment ...
they're premature !
i'm glad it happened .
why?
because now father and the council have decreed an acceleration in the crackdown on offenders .
whoever did it ... all they accomplished was a quicker end to the resistance .
it's gonna be a massacre , cleric .
i came to tell you ... there's a raid in the nether ...
sector 7 .
so get ready .
that door behind you ...
go .
go , damn you !
get out of here , god damn it !
if you don't , you're dead !
don't do it .
he'll shoot us in the back .
if i was gonna shoot you , i'd shoot you in the face .
now go .
damn you !
follow me .
now !
let's go !
there will be no detention .
repeat ... no detention for any purpose .
all prisoners and apprehendees are to be put down .
look out !
aah !
aaaah !
cleric , what's happening?
we heard gunshots .
go !
what are you doing?
cleric !
they're resistance fighters .
cleric !
he's a sense offender !
cover all quadrants !
secure the perimeter !
what is this?
what are you doing? !
nicely done , cleric .
you drive them into the trap ...
i close it .
the very definition of ... teamwork .
don't you think?
why don't you take the honors of the execution , cleric?
these people should be taken for clinical interrogation .
cleric ...
father's rulings are quite clear .
offenders are to be shot on sight .
they have valuable information .
cleric ...
they can be put to much better use .
cleric .
if your weapon's low , please , use mine .
no .
i think , in the end ... it'll be better if you have it .
captain .
yes , sir .
firing positions .
ready ...
aim ...
fire !
sir?
yes , cleric?
you asked me to become father's instrument against the resistance .
i'm ready .
today .
i wish to show my faith .
i wish , with your permission , to locate the underground once and for all .
to destroy it .
to destroy it .
good .
do it .
i'm so ... so very sorry .
these are the possessions he had on him at the time of death .
the illegal ones will be burned with him .
good .
errol partridge .
the name supposed to mean something to me?
he was a grammaton cleric , first class .
you knew him .
news bulletin ...
i'm a sense offender .
i don't hang around much with the cleric .
i want to know about him .
well ...
i suggest you go ask him .
but i understand that he's dead ... killed by your friends at the tetragrammaton .
not by my friends .
by me .
aaah !
you were lovers .
the underground is our foe , and greater than even the threat of those who have forsaken their prozium for emotion is the threat of those selfsame individuals united .
they are the secret organization ...
and thus , it is in the writing of the father that we find our greatest ...
good afternoon , sir .
what will it be for you?
the latest copy of the inserts?
revised edition of the manifesto?
errol partridge .
what do you know about him?
i beg your pardon?
everyone out .
now .
i'm gonna ask you one more time .
errol partridge ... what do you know about him?
i'm sure this must be some mis ...
you're an offender .
i'm not .
no?
then why are you so scared of me?
now , you will tell me everything you know about errol partridge , or i will have a wagon come to take you to the hall of destruction for summary combustion .
l i really don't know ...
speak !
he ... he'd come in here with a fellow named jurgen .
why?
that's ... that's all i know .
i swear .
jurgen !
interesting .
ugh ow !
ugh !
we've been watching you , preston .
you're jurgen .
you're feeling .
do you know why you came?
welcome to the underground .
polygraph .
it detects fluctuations of human emotion .
we have to be sure .
mary .
you're carrying in your left pocket a red ribbon sprayed with her scent .
you breathe it in sometimes when you think there's no one to see .
but what you feel ... what you feel could only be satisfied by falling yourself into her .
she's scheduled for combustion ... tomorrow .
i know .
you know , i was like you .
but the first thing you learn about emotion is that it has its price ... a complete paradox .
but without restraint ... without control ... emotion is chaos .
but how is that diff ...
the difference being is that when we want to feel , we can .
it's just that ... some of us ... some of us have to forgo that luxury so that the rest can have it .
some very few of us have to force ourselves not to feel .
like me .
like you .
what can i do?
you can kill father .
cleric john preston ...
you are to come with us immediately .
cleric preston .
sir .
i've heard the most disturbing rumor .
rumor , sir?
yes .
a rumor maintaining that one of us , one of the cleric , has secretly taken it upon himself to cease his dose , that one of our elite number is actually feeling .
feeling , sir?
are you playing with me , cleric? !
no , sir .
this person , i'm told , is actually attempting to contact the resistance .
now tell me , if you'll be so kind , how exactly ... have you been making use of your time of late?
attempting to contact the resistance , sir .
attempting?
how is it that you intend to expose this traitor if all you do is attempt?
you're ... absolutely ... 1 00 % right , sir .
of course i am .
the cleric is the final line of defense .
if the resistance compromises it , we are doomed .
father is doomed .
i will redouble my efforts , sir , to locate the resistance , to find this traitor , and bring them all to the council's fair justice .
do it .
what are you doing?
what are you doing?
i , uh ...
i was checking to make sure you've been ... taking your interval .
and are you satisfied?
yes , i am .
good night , dad .
i don't understand .
my execution's set .
why are you here?
aren't you gonna dose?
my god .
what ...
what'll you do?
i don't know .
50 sweepers , maybe more .
what about an audience?
can you arrange to meet with him?
father's never given a single audience since the upheaval .
the danger of assassination is too great .
they trained you your whole life to fight these kind of odds .
even if i could ... even if i could make it through , what guarantee is there it would accomplish anything , that anything would be different?
we have a network that's larger than you could ever imagine .
instant word comes that father is dead , that the council is leaderless .
bombs that have already been planted will be set off at prozium clinics and factories around libria .
if we can succeed in disrupting the supply for even one day ... one day ... our cause will be won by human nature itself .
what about war , the everyday cruelties that are all gone now?
replaced by the touch of grammaton .
will you do it?
yes .
can you?
i don't know .
don't ...
seeing her one last time will only make it harder to do what you have to do .
the cleric was implemented and sent out to search and destroy such objects that remained and , if necessary , those who attempted to ...
file footage .
the council ...
viviana preston .
sentence and incineration .
auditory .
viviana preston , for ceasing your interval , for the crime of feeling , you stand condemned to suffer annihilation in the city furnaces .
you will be taken there immediately , and you will burn .
the cleric was implemented and sent out to search and destroy such objects that remained and , if necessary , those who attempted to ...
the council ...
the incineration ... has it gone through? !
it's going through now .
hey !
machine turbines priming .
machine turbines priming .
tetragrammaton ...
i need to speak to this woman !
you're too late , sir .
the time lock is engaged .
if we force the door now , the turbines will explode at street level . ... personnel , clear the area immediately .
all unauthorized personnel , clear the area immediately .
turbines primed .
fire in 1 0 seconds ... 9 seconds ... 8 seconds ... 7 seconds ... 6 seconds ... 5 seconds ... 4 seconds ... 3 seconds ... 2 seconds ...
turbines ... fire .
cleric john preston ...
you are under arrest .
this man ... this senior cleric ... has ceased the dose .
he is feeling !
he is the worm that has been eating at the core of our great society !
and i ...
i have brought him for your justice .
ugh !
i told you i'd make my career with you , preston .
vice council ...
this man is guilty of consorting with sense offenders , of having relations with a female , of sense crime itself .
dispatch a search team to the cleric's quarters to search for unused ...
uh , that won't be necessary , sir .
if you'll run the trace record on his side arm , you will find that it was he who was with the sweeper team when they were murdered .
cleric ...
i assume you have something to say to me .
i know ... it's hard to believe ...
... that a cleric of the tetragrammaton could turn his back on everything he's been taught , would become associated with the resistance , even becoming a champion in its underground .
but it's true .
i promised that i would bring you that man .
and i have .
cleric brandt ...
sir?
the trace shows that it was your gun in the nether with the sweepers .
that's impossible .
this is wrong .
i think , in the end ... it'll be better if you have it .
he switched them .
he switched them .
see , i have his gun now .
of course you do .
you took it when you arrested me .
what?
take him to the hall of destruction for summary judgment and combustion .
wait , wait , wait .
wait !
i can explain this .
uh , sir , i'm not feeling !
he is the one who's feeling !
this is a mistake !
of course ... since a complaint has been lodged ,
law and the letter is that i allow a team to carry out the search of your premises .
do you think that's entirely necessary , cleric , or am i being too ... exacting?
as you say , sir , it's the law and the letter .
and it doesn't disturb you in the least that your colleague is going to his end?
the only thing that disturbs me , sir , is that i am father's instrument against the underground , and yet ...
i've never had the honor of meeting him .
hmm .
yes , but , cleric , you know that father never grants an audience to anyone .
even to the man who brings him the resistance?
sorry , sir .
just a formality .
the search team will be up momentarily .
excellent .
i have nothing to hide .
the search teams are already inside , sir .
excellent .
looking for something?
if i were you ...
i'd be more careful in the future .
how long?
since mom .
and lisa?
of course .
how did you know?
you forget ... it's my job to know what you're thinking .
then you know what i'm gonna do now .
you have a message for the vice council?
you have a message for the vice council?
it's done .
i've located the resistance .
come now .
you'll have them all .
do not address father unless first addressed by him .
avoid eye contact .
if you should break his personal security zone , you will be immediately put down by snipers .
is that understood?
you'll be required to surrender your firearm , of course , and then there's the test .
test?
yes .
you didn't imagine we would risk exposing father to even such a dedicated servant as yourself without first having tested you , did you?
please .
cleric ... your weapon , please .
here .
sit .
we'll start with a test question first .
more of a riddle , actually .
what would you say is the easiest way to get a weapon away from a grammaton cleric?
you ask him for it .
i told you i'd make my career with you , cleric .
... to combine the capacity ...
preston ...
brandt's job was simple ... to make you feel like you'd won , to make you feel safe .
for years , i tried to infiltrate an agent into the underground ... ... until it hit me ... in order to pass undetected into their midst , in order to be trusted by them , my provocateur would have to think like them and would have to feel like them .
but where to find such a man ... a man with the capacity to feel who didn't yet know it?
but ... we've never met .
no?
don't look so surprised , preston .
why should father be more real than any other political puppet?
the real father died years ago .
the council simply elected me to pursue his paternal tradition .
and you , preston , the supposed savior of the resistance , are now its destroyer , and , along with them , you've given me yourself ... calmly ... cooly ... entirely without incident .
no .
oh ...
shit .
not without incident .
i'm coming .
you really should learn to knock .
how did it feel , preston?
agh !
ugh !
ugh !
uhh ah !
wah !
ugh !
agh !
uhh !
ugh !
ugh !
aggh !
aggh !
mind the uniform , cleric .
i plan to be wearing it for a long time .
be careful , preston .
you're treading on my dreams .
ohh !
wait !
wait .
look at me .
look at me .
