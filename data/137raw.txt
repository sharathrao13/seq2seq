situated on wilshire boulevard's famous museum row , the la brea tar pits are one of the la basin's most active geological features .
here for the past 40, 000 years a deep fissure in the earth's crust has allowed oily tar and methane to bubble up to the surface from far underground .
evidence of the ceaseless activity below our very feet .
the 22 storey beverly heights apartment building will open on schedule in spite of construction delays .
that's the word from developer norman calder .
many see the new land mark tower as a sign the la economy's on the rebound .
now here's jere laird with the rest of the business news .
wow .

i think i married a genius .
three years , four banks , $100 million , but the doors are open .
i am so proud of you , honey .
you never gave up .
you didn't let me .

a big favour .
i'm gonna miss my class .
hello?
mike !
oh , fine .
a perfect little ray of sunshine like i was after my parents separated .
every couple of minutes her head comes off her shoulders , rotates 360 degrees , then she starts watching tv again .
it's been hours .
well , we've got a situation here .
i'll come home as soon as i can .
we'll go to oj's house , then the beverly center , right?
i thought we said disneyland .
we talked about getting my nose pierced .
not in this life , baby .
i'll be home soon .
what can i do for you?
i'm getting my nose pierced .
it's a nice look , especially when you sneeze .
you can't do this !
what? !
you're talking about 10, 000 customers with no cooking and no heat .
gas will be restored once it's safe .
when?
you're talking about sending a crew to every house to turn on every damn pilot .
this could take weeks , if not more .
excuse me just one second , please .
having fun yet?
i'm starting to miss the mississippi .
the mud , floods?
mike , you have a call on your private line .
that'll be my girl wanting a tattoo .
help me with this guy .
how you doing?
oh , wendy .
why did you leave kelly alone?
pulling one of your usual stunts .
what?
it was an earthquake .
she hates earthquakes .
she's only 13 .
nobody likes an earthquake .
she's been alone ...
she has not .
i left her with a baby sitter .
who?
a neighbour .
how's she supposed to know what to do if there's another earthquake?
kelly knows what to do ...
you never change , mike .
hello?
hello?
phone went dead .
yeah , they been doing that all over the city .
i'll get a crew out right away .
why not do more underground blasting to see if there's a fault line?
no , let's do it your way .
my way?
we'll empty every building over two storeys .
god , you're a geek .
mike , emmit .
you're a geek .
nice shirt , stan .
you roark?
amy barnes .
hi .
i'm from clgs .
nice to meet you .
careful not to disagree with anything dr barnes says .
would you give it a rest?
all we said was cahuenga was geologically unstable .
the whole city is .
that's why we don't want tunnels blown up .
thanks for coming on short notice , but save the fight for later .
sure .
two o'clock good for you?
huh?
go ahead .
encourage her .
dr barnes , can you tell me what's under macarthur park?
not with any certainty , no ,
that's a shock . but i ...
we ran trains through all day .
no incidents .
this analysis from the guys who collapsed hollywood boulevard .
my engineers were there no demonstrable risk .
you got conflicting evidence?
some reason to strand passengers?
i'm all ears .
until then , we stay on schedule .
i'm sorry , mike .
oh , lah !
he's gotta change his nicotine patch .
so?
so .
so?
how do i find out what's underneath macarthur park? .. low grade evacuation ofmacarthurpark .
city officials won'tsayif it has anything to do with the deaths today of those seven public workers .
take a look at this .
ok .
um , what am i looking at?
that lake was 62 degrees yesterday .
today it's up to 68 .
yeah , it's a sunny day .
it is lovely , isn't it?
it takes a geological event to heat a million gallons ofwater by six degrees in 12 hours .
what is a geological event?
i'm sure you're aware of this , that our continents sit on tectonic plates .
great big rafts on an ocean of molten rock .
yeah .
when they shift , like they did this morning , we get an earthquake .
ok?
yeah .
same mechanism can sometimes open a fissure , sometimes .
magma can find one of those fissures and rise up through it .
what's magma?
lava .
lava?
uh , here in la?
it's one of several possibilities .
it is unlikely , but it is a possibility .
we have a history of that in the downtown area?
paracutin , 1943 , a mexican farmer sees smoke coming out of his cornfield .
a week later there was a volcano 1, 000ft high .
there's no history of anything until it happens , then there is .
well , thanks , ladies .
um , enjoy your day in the park .
ooh , yeah , that was subtle .
what?
you want me to humour him?
he asked us for a hypothesis .
you have a better one?
it's lava .
lava , hm .
hey , hey , that's me !
my god , i'm gonna call my mom .
uh huh .
i'm on the tv , man !
excuse me .
you invited us , remember?
you want me to call olber and tell him the demonstrable risk is lava?
just give me time to do my work .
cos a lake went up a few degrees? !
no , because seven men baked to death and nobody knows why .
mta does not answer to the city .
i cannot go to the mat with them unless you know something .
i do know something , just not with any certainty .
is that the company line?
i'm a scientist .
certainty is a big word .
i need time to collect my data .
i've gotta get down there and get samples .
i can't let you do that .
why not?
it is too dangerous .
that's why .
i'm sorry .
shit .
what did he say?
oh , it's too dangerous .
it's man's work and you're girlies .
i can't let you go down there .
he likes you .
i can tell .
he's ok .
in a macho , controlling , " suspicious of anyone not from his home town " kinda way .
so you like him .
this is good .
we've got to go down there .
i don't see how we can .
this place is swarming with cops .
yeah .
let's do it in the morning before the cops come on duty .

several buildings are burning out of control .
it began a few minutes after the quake , started by an undetermined source .
there was an explosion , breaking windows , then flames .
bob , could it be a ruptured gas line?

oh , my god !
mitch ...
mitch , i don't know how to describe this , but the tar pits are on fire and are spilling out on to wilshire boulevard .
it's coming right up out of the ground itself .
it's as if the tar caught fire , melted and somehow expanded .
the downed fire truck is still on its side , help ! injured firefighters in need of medical help .
hang on !
rescue personnel are starting to arrive .
i know this sounds crazy , but it looks like volcanic lava pouring onto the street .

the house behindmejust explodedinto flames and , to put it bluntly , all hell is breaking loose .
you can see the panic in residents 'faces .

no one has any idea what to put in the way of this lava .
declaration of emergency , assistance from county , state and federal .
all available national guard units and air tankers .
we need water dropped .

safest place .
all right , cedars .

i got a message from sindelar .
he's stuck on " the damn freeway . " wants me to tell you ..
i've got a desk .
that's where i work . .. yadda yadda yadda .
tell him not to expect me .
out .
no problem .
mitch , it's a chaotic scene , with emergency personnel desperate to stop this thing .
officer , do you know where the driver of that bus is?
what are you talking about?
come with me .
come on . .. rolling past the foot of county art museum , ...
we now have a name for this crisis .
it is , according to the us geological survey , a volcano .
yes , you heard that correctly .
as remarkable as itsounds , a volcano here
excuse me ! is wreaking havoc throughout the city ...
oh , my god .
you would have loved this , rachel .
cover !
cover !
hey .
hey , no .
look at it .
keep watching it .
now !
move , you guys !
it's a lava bomb .
you don't do anything un ... until you know where it's gonna land .
i need 20 strong men standing right here .
go get those firemen right now , and those officers right there .
get over here , guys .
over by this bus .
right now .
let's go , hurry up .
god , this hieronymus bosch is heavy .
that's cos he deals with man's inclination to a thing , in defiance of god's will .
i didn't mean it like that .
oh .
fellas , come over here .
right over here .
you were right .
hardly .
gentlemen , i want to move the bus up against the museum like so .
like so !?
yes , like so .
then i wanna shoot out the tyres on the other side .
i cannot turn it over unless the tyres on one side are flat , all right?
what we wanna do is build a corridor to keep whatever this is ...
it's lava .
all right , it's lava .
get round to the front , fellas .
hurry up .
get around the front of the bus .
all right , on the count ofthree , fellas .
one , ... two three .
come on .
police officers on the other side , shoot out those tyres .
the rest of you guys , along this bus .
come here .
all right , on the countdown , aim low .
three , two , one , fire .
all right , we know that stuff is lava .
what do i do next?
you have to evacuate the west side .
this'll burn through the city till it hits the ocean .
it has a million people .
there'll be a million dead or homeless .
this is going to destroy everything it touches .
he's still breathing .
can you grab this arm?
yeah .
grab him right there .
let's go , let's go !
let's get this guy out .
are you realising what we're dealing with?
this is a volcano .
all we can do is get out of its way .
run for the hills and hide?
right .
i can't do that .
look out !
look out !
stay with this guy .
stay with him .
hey , get that ladder over here now !
bring it down !
what're you gonna do?
get us outta here if i can .
hey , watch out for those flames !
get that ladder out of the fire !
the hose is gonna burn !

you all right?
oh ...
i'm sorry .
sorry .
are you all right !?
yeah , i've never been better .
so , what do we do now?
come on .
that lava is coming from a vent .
bad news is there could be other vents , bigger ones , maybe ten times as big , which means we may not have seen the main eruption yet .
you think that's gonna happen?
i need specifics , a phone .
your phone !
give me that .
hey !
i need that back .
i'm on the air .
i need that back .
stay where you are .
stay where you are !
hey , lava's moving round the bus !
give me that phone .
hey , that's property of knx .
not any more , pal .
all right , emmit , get me 200 k rails to build a corridor .
what are k rails?
they're concrete freeway dividers .
you planning on channelling this?
i'm on the telephone , all right .
sorry .
mike , i'll call public works .
they could have some .
roark?
yeah , and any private contractor we have ...
roark !
hell !
and call gator .
cedars is gonna be swamped .
i want him over there .
you don't want him with you?
no , kelly is on her way to cedars now .
she got burnt , emmit .
shit .
she'll have a suite by the time the sun comes up , all right?
all right .
out .
what?
the bus is just deflecting this , ok?
it is coming back around .
it's got in the store .
we are dealing with determined stuff here .
all right , we'll build berms until the k rails get here .
with what?
we'll dig up the streets , we'll improvise .
literally hundreds of firemen , police , city workers have grabbed pickaxes to try to channel this down ... .. the ash and the smoke in the air right now . .. to make a dentin this latest attack on la .
that wall has to be five or six metres tall .
stay with it .
it's hitting every street .
we've got structural fires and inhalation cases .
i can't keep it out without help .
i'm working on it .
meantime , do all you can to keep it on wilshire .
use fire trucks , if you have to .
my street's on fire .
you gotta get some trucks down there .
what street?
the one with smoke coming out .
stanley .
once this is under control .
there won't be houses left by then !
look , i'm sorry .
we'll get to 'em when we can .
yo , i'm talking about people's houses .
you're up here saving museums .
d'you wanna get this guy off me?
oh , great .
mark fuhrman .
let me see your hands .
you gotta be joking .
give me your hands !
get your goddamn hands off me !
hey , what's going on?
he was harassing a firefighter .
bullshit .
i was asking for help .
this is stupid .
let him go .
i'm taking him in .
aw , he's all yours .
shouldn't you be saving lives?
don't move !
watch that third rail .
i don't want anybody hitting that .
hey , watch for the rubble right there !
watch for the rubble .
oh , jesus .
there she is .
looks like we got a hell of a fire , stan .
yeah , we sure do .

i gotta find the driver .
every one of these people off the train now .
come on , move it !
move it !
go !
go !
stan , get back here !
we are in the parking lot at cedars sinai and this is an incredible scene .
these people are staying in the parking lot because the emergencyroom is filled to capacity .
the injuredjustkeep coming here one afteranother .
this , to me , seems more like a mash unit than a majormetropolitan hospital ...
yeah?
gator , you got my girl?
right here .
doc says she's gonna be fine .
nearly done .
all right , let me talk to her .
man's got a direct line to the governor , but he's calling you .
i'm fine , daddy .
honestly , ...
i'm ok .
this is gonna sting .
ok?
i love you , baby .
then stop sending us bodies .
we have gota full house overhere .
i don't have any choice .
cedars sinai is the only emergency room that's still safe and north of the flow .
we got earthquake victims , burns , smoke inhalations .
they're doing triage on the sidewalk .
put the post ops in the mall .
beverly center's gotta have its own power .
the mall , huh?
yeah .
anything good at the cineplex?
have the cops close the streets for you .
oh , goddammit .
jesus h christ .
see that?
the flow's gonna turn .
yeah , i saw it .
what's south of here , lieutenant?
convalescent homes , hospitals .
i'll tell you .
a big gas station , a million houses and everyone i know .
get back in there .
we need everybody we can get .
shit !
emmit , where are those k rails?
i need 'em right now .
hey , what were you trying to do?
take that guy downtown?
better take the freeway .
wilshire looks bad .
hey , enough !
let's get these people on the cart .
come on , stan .
come on , stan .
where the hell are you?
holy mary , mother of god , pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death .
hail mary , full of grace , the lord is with thee .
holy mary , mother of god , pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death .
hail mary , full of grace , the lord is with thee .

aaahhhhhhh !
aaahhh !
ah !
emmit , faa want an update .
where are we with the airports?
no more outgoing .
incoming is being re routed to ontario .
no , no , no , no .
marty , no .
look at the screen .
that cloud is blowing due east .
we gotta send everything to san diego .
emmit , they got two gas lines burning on fairfax .
they can't get any hydrant pressure .
swimming pools .
what about them?
pump out all the swimming pools .
that's all the water we need .
emmit , just got a call from la brea .
total gridlock from pico to sunset .
didn't we send over those traffic cops?
that's who's calling .
cars keep stalling out because of the ash .
it's clogging up the air filters .
chevettes , right?
ok , nowyou can see it coming rightat us .
just a relentless tide oflava melting the street itself .
itincinerates everything it touches .
they're using concrete , they're using cars , ...
you gotta get me some water pressure !
i can't .
the city's out .
hydrants are dry !
lights are out in san francisco .
we gotta get these guys some help .
yeah , i can see that .
don't you hear me?
i said the lights are out in san francisco .
but this street's on fire .
nobody gives a shit about san francisco !
all right , good to see you .
we want a corridor outta these k rails .
keep it flowing down wilshire and headed west , ok?
where are the rest of them?
this is it .
there's only about 80 here .
82 .
everything else is stuck on the 5 or 10 .
we're trying to keep the city in one piece .
80 rails won't do it !
what you blaming me for?
convenience !
maybe we can chopper more in?
one at at time , forget it !
why not knock down a couple of buildings and block this son of a bitch?
all right , come with me .
you guys , come with me .
open a reservoir !
and the city drinks what? !
there won't be a city , ifyou don't move .
i'm doing my best !
knock this shit off !
what is with you people?
chief , how long will it take this stuff to get to fairfax?
about ten minutes , give or take .
enough time to build a barricade?
all right , look .
wilshire boulevard , fairfax .
80 k rails , double stacked in a horseshoe .
ok?
a cul de sac .
that's gotta be a wall at least 6ft high .
d'you have any helicopters , water tankers?
not yet , but they're on the way .
once you get this lava to pool , dump everything on it , all at once , to form a crust .
maybe it'll dam itself like one did in lceland .
thank you .
you're welcome .
this is putting a band aid on a broken leg .
i don't know how many men to keep putting in front of this thing .
as many people as it takes .
listen up , let me tell you what's south of us .
no more museums or department stores , just homes , people .
if we run now , they're defenceless .
you don't like my plan , give me another one , but don't say we're backing out .
is everybody clear on that?
yeah !
all right , let's go .
build a wall .
come on , push him over .
push him over .
all right , come on .
push 'em on in .
give me 14 or 15 guys on each of these things .
right over here on this k rail .
right in here .
hold it .
on the other side .
watch your leg !
right over here , fellas .
there's room by there .
pick 'em up .
let's go .
lift !
come on .
we need more guys on this one .
shit , it's too heavy .
hey , man , you know what they say .
no pain , no gain .
all right , that's it !
i knew it , i'm about to be the volcano version of rodney king .
give me your hand .
roll the tape .
y'all got this?
give me your hands .
go home .
i'm supposed to say thanks?
no .
what did you do that for?
let's go .
still don't have enough guys over here !
give us a hand .
come on .
come on !
you block this , it stays out the neighbourhood?
yeah , that's the idea .
come on .
let's go .
come on , move !
move !
come on !
what you waiting for?
come on .
all right !
let's move this thing !
1 , ... 2 , ... 3 !
aagh !
ok , keep moving .
put it over there !
with so manypeople injured , it is so easy to forget the victims who can't tell you where ithurts .
and , fortunately , these wonderful veterinarians have put their lives on hold to help these animals .
this is a greatstory .
this pot belliedpig was trying to findhis owner ...
ok , just one more stitch .
you're really brave , you know that?
we got internal bleeding here .
can you watch her?
are you ok?
yeah .
is the boy hers?
yes .
we're putting kids in the mall .
prep her .
mommy .
mommy ...
how are you at baby sitting?
hi .
hi .
you ok?
step up , we don't have a lotta time !
roark !
yeah?
there is lava in the red line .
just came through on the emergency band .
it destroyed a train near macarthur park .
is it still flowing?
it's stopped , but i think there's more .
there's got to be something feeding this from below .
a source .
it broke through here , at the tar pits , created this vent .
we now know it broke through at macarthur park , so it's travelling laterally underground over the course of at least eight miles .
you said it blows up .
i've never tracked lava under a city before .
i don't know what it'll do with man made tunnels to travel through .
i need everything to deal with what's in front of me .
i don't have time for a theory .
all right , but somebody's got to .
i can only fight what i can see .
i know .
good luck .
i'm gonna check it out .
all right .
here's a recap of the crisis as itstands .
throughout the city shelters are being hastily erected out of schools , churches and synagogues in an attempt to house the shaken citizens .
ok , ready , you guys?
ok , 1 , 2 , 3 .
shh .
rock beats scissor and scissor beats paper .
i'm not paper .
i'm lava .
what beats that?
my dad ...
i hope .
save your hoses , chief .
i wanna let it pool up all the way to the top .
save your hoses !
not a drop until i give the word .
we'll just have to wait it out now .
this is the moment of truth .
the entire streetis now engulfedin flames .
the weight of this lava has to be intense . .. um das lava zuruckdrangen .
will this plan work?
hubschrauber !
all right , that's it , chief .
open 'em up !
open hoses .
open hoses !
there must be thousands of gallons of water being dropped over this entire area .
the entire area is drenched and the steam coming off this thing is unbelievable .
oh , shit .
oh , god .
i don't believe it .
it looks possible that this whole thing maybe nearing an end .
this incredible gamble seems to be paying off .
did we just beat this bastard?
it looks like it !
flood control !
ladies and gentlemen , it is a miracle .
and look at the faces of these people .
look at these guys !
it looks like they've done it .
they have accomplished the impossible .
they've beaten mothernature and claimed an extraordinary victory over the volcano .
one lastheroic stand here on the corner offairfaxand wilshire .
hell of a party !
i probably should have brought a hat .
chief , they need some help over on stanley .
structural fires , residential .
miller , get your engine over to stanley .
yes , sir .
i guess that's my bus .
hey , good luck .
you , too , man .
show me what this baby can do .
you ready or what?
yo , i always wanted to ride one of these things , man .
stanley ave , here we come !
whoo !
you're a good man , jerry .
all right , roark .
thanks , fellas .
way to go , guys !
roark !
hey , way to go .
how fast can you get to wilshire and western?
we got a problem .
not any more , we got it stopped .
volume of ash is too hot to be out of danger .
how come it's stopped?
maybe it went some place else .
how d'you know it didn'tjust stop?
i don't , but when mount st helen's blew the force was 27, 000 times greater than that of the hiroshima bomb .
you think that vent released that much energy?
no .
let's assume we haven'tseen the realbulk of the magma yet .
trust me , get down here .
shit !
hey , hey , that's my bike .
as crews battled the flow on wilshire , emergency rooms at cedars sinai and midwayhospitals have all reported that their staffs andsupplies are being overwhelmed ...
yes?
jaye , i wantyou home with me where it's safe .
norman , can we talk later?
i don't like his breathing .
let's tube him .
jaye , you've been there hours .
let someone else take over !
god knows what those " people " are coughing up on you .
calder , we need help .
i'm hanging up .
jaye !
go !
right over the red line .
that steam could come from anywhere .
maybe the quake broke a water main .
how'd it get heated?
i don't know .
lower me down .
i'm gonna find out .
no .
why?
too dangerous?
yes .
i thought it was a water main .
all right .
i'll go .
how you gonna get up?
i'm gonna lift you?
i'm not letting you go .
then what are we gonna do?
oh , god , this is so stupid .
this city's finally paying for its arrogance .
which particular arrogance is that?
building a subway under land that's seismically active .
it was a foolish man that builthis house upon the sand .
matthew 7 : 26 .
a favourite among geologists .
all right , there's the tunnel .
i don't see anything .
hm .
what way are we facing?
i don't know .
i can't see anything .
hey !
wha ...
oh !
damn .
ow !
damn !
oh , god .
the tunnel's insulating it .
it's like a lava tube .
it's keeping it fluid , which is why it's moving so fast .
but moving where?
it's gonna go through the tunnels until it hits a block .
once there , it'll punch through .
you mean erupt .
yeah !
one , two , three .
one , two , three .
how far between tunnel sections?
how should i know?
guess !
10 or 12 feet .
this is roark .
i need to know where the red line stops .
we gotta figure out how fast this shit is moving .
you mean where the last station is?
no , where did you stop the tunnel?
we stopped drilling under the beverly center , la cienega .
my god .
that's where cedars sinai is .
that's where kelly is .
how long before it hits la cienega?
hold on .
how long before it hits la cienega? !
i don't know .
if a tunnel's caved in , it'll be slower .
god .
30 minutes , maybe less .
that's not enough time !
no kidding .
we gotta move those people .
no , no , that ain't a possibility , mike .
we don't have any hands left .
we got secondary fires popping off all over the city .
they're looting in beverly hills .
then we have to re route it or block it in some way .
we got 2, 000 people in the way .
listen , moses couldn't re route this shit , ok?
it's everywhere .
we got a flow in a storm drain ...
the genesee transformer's out .
that means the west ...
where's that storm drain go?
it dumps into ballona creek .
what did you just say?
hold it !
it dumps into ballona creek .
ballona creek runs into the ocean .
we caught a break on that one .
yeah .
i would say !
how close is it to cedars?
it's close enough .
all right , listen up , emmit .
i need a demolitions team ,
lapd , national guard , private contractor , or all three at san vicente and 3rd right now !
we want 'em with all they've got .
oh , shit .
man , i wanna be like mike .
right outside cedars we don'tknow what's going on rightnow .
officials have toldpeople here to evacuate immediately .
and realise , these are injuredpeople , some severely , so something is going on .
all right , here's what the lava is doing .
it will flow down the red line subway tunnel until it comes to a dead end : this intersection .
this is the holly hills storm drain extension .
it connects here to the holly hills trench .
anything that flows into that trench will come through the storm drain , on to the ocean .
we got 25 minutes ...
20 minutes .
20 minutes to extend the san vicente trench 200 yards up san vicente boulevard to this place here .
extend it?
yes , extend it .
where are we at?
ground zero .
lava'll break through here .
right here?
yes .
i want you to drill holes in san vicente boulevard ,
iower enough charges into it to blow up a trench 200 yards long , as wide as the street
and as deep as you can make .
what !
we're gonna take this thing to the ocean .
wait , this won't work .
the street slopes the other way .
look at the contours .
it is not going to move into the trench .
it will go the opposite direction into the patients .
maybe some can be diverted ...
no !
it won't .
would you trust me?
it is going to flow that way .
now , everybody grab some stretchers .
let's save as many lives as we possibly can .
that's 2, 000 patients .
we can't possibly save everybody .
i know .
i sent them over there with my daughter .
i ..
i ...
i ...
i don't know ...
i don't know what to do .
what about a dam?
something we can drop in front of the hospital and divert the flow this way?
what?
what she said , knocking a building down?
are you serious?
yes , i'm serious .
it's gotta be 50, 000 tons of steel and concrete .
would that work?
you are gonna knock a building down?
yes , i am .
would it work?
i think it might .
i think it might .
you wanna bring it down against the mall?
absolutely .
that's a precision drop .
that takes days to plan .
set a speed record .
you wanna knock down a building in 20 minutes?
