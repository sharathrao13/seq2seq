maybe they'll give you a pardon , man .
yeah .
that's why none ofthe volunteers come back .
they all get a pardon .
some come back , i heard .
please put me back !
don't take me !
they got 'em up on the seventh foor .
they hide 'em up there .
they're all messed up in the head .
you don't know they're all messed up .
nobody's seen 'em .
and maybe they're not messed up .
that's a rumour .
nobody knows that .
i don't believe that .
good luck , man .
volunteer duty !
i didn't volunteer .
you causing trouble again?
no , no trouble .
these are the instructions forthe first timeprobe .

james cole cleared from quarantine .
thankyou .
you two wait outside .
he's got a history , doctor .
violence .
antisocial six .
repeated violations of the permanent emergency code .
lnsolence .
defiance .
disregard ofauthority .
doing 25 to life .
i don't think he's gonna hurt us .
you aren't gonna hurt us , are you , mr cole?
no , sir .
why don't you sit down , mr cole?
we appreciate your volunteering .
you're a very good observer .
thankyou .
we have a very advanced programme .
something very different .
a chance to reduce your sentence .
and possibly play an important role ... in returning the human race to the surface ofthe earth .
we want tough minded people .
strong mentally .
we've had some misfortunes with unstable types .
for a man in your position , an opportunity .
not to volunteer could be a real mistake .
definitely a mistake .
yet among the myriad microwaves ... the infrared messages , the gigabytes ofones and zeros ... we find words , byte sized now ... tinier even than science ...
lurking in some vague electricity .
but ifwe but listen ... we hear the solitary voice ofthat poet telling us ... yesterday this day's madness did prepare ... tomorrow's silent triumph ofdespair .
drink , foryou know not whence you came , nor why .
drink , foryou know not why you go , nor where .
wandering around in nothing but his underpants ... and one ofthose plastic , see through lady's raincoats .
so , they get there , they ask the guy real nice for some kind of ld .
he gets agitated , starts screaming about viruses .
totally irrational , totally disoriented .
doesn't know where he is , what day ofthe week it is .
all they got was his name .
they figured he's stoned out of his mind .
some kind of psychotic episode .
he's been tested for drugs?
negative for drugs .
but he took on five cops like he was dusted to the eyeballs .
no drugs .
you believe that?
he's in restraints .
yeah .
weren't you listenin '?
i've got two police officers in the hospital !
the medic gave him enough stelazine to kill a horse .
he's rarin 'to go .
that would explain the bruises , i guess .
the struggle .
yeah .
you wanna go in there , examine him?
yes , please .
ls this all you have?
ran it through your system?
no match up .
no licence , no prints , no warrants .
nothing .
i should probably go in with you .
no , thankyou .
that won't be necessary .
all right .
he'll be right here , just in case .
mr cole , my name is kathryn railly .
i'm a psychiatrist .
i work for the county .
i don't work for the police .
so my concern is foryour well being .
do you understand that?
need to go !
need to go !
i can't make the police let you go .
but i do wanna help you , so l
i need you to tell me exactly what happened tonight .
do you think you can do that, james?
may i call youjames?
james .
nobody ever calls me that .
have you been a patient at county?
no .
have i seen you someplace?
not possible .
i need to go !
i'm supposed to be gathering information .
what kind of information?
won't help you .
won't help anyone .
won't change anything .
james , do you know why you're here?
'cause i'm a good observer .
i've got a tough mind .
you don't remember assaulting a police officer?
why am i chained?
why are these chains on me?
you've been in an institution before , haven't you?
or hospital?
no !
now i need to go .
need to go !
have you been in prison, james?
underground .
hiding?
i love this air .
oh , it's such wonderful air .
what's wonderful about the air, james?
very fresh .
no germs .
why do you think there aren't any germs in the air?
this is october , right?
april .
what year is this?
what year do you think it is?
1 996 .
that's the future, james .
do you thinkyou're living in the future?
1 996 is the past .
no , 1 996 is the future .
this is 1 990 .
shut up , ladies .
where're you taking me?
south of france , buddy .
fancy hotel .
you'll love it .
i can't go to france .
i just need to make a telephone call .
yeah , yeah .
zip it , daisy .
you fooled the shrink , but you don't fool us .
let's go , ace .
all right .
come on , come on .
there you go .
now , lemme see your head, jimbo .
see ifyou got any creepy crawlers .
i need to make a telephone call .
got to get to a doctor, jimbo .
can't make no calls till the doctor says .
it's very important !
what you gotta do, jimbo , is take it easy .
relax into things .
and we'll all get along fine ifyou just relax .
let's go .
come on , let's go .
hey , goines !
yo , goines !
yo, jeffrey !
what?
look here .
this here'sjames .
now , do me a favour .
why don't you show him around?
tell him the tv rules .
show him the games and stuff .
okay?
how much you gonna pay me?
how much?
i'd be doin 'yourjob .
five thousand dollars .
that enough?
five thousand?
i'll wire a cheque to your account as usual .
i'll give him the deluxe mental hospital tour .
kid around , makes 'em feel good .
we're pals .
you're the prisoners .
no , you're the guards .
now you got it .
okay , it's all in good fun .
here's some games here .
and there's get out !
get out !
he was in my chair .
games .
games .
here's some games .
games that wanna get out .
see?
more games .
games , they vegetize you .
see?
lfyou play the games , you're voluntarily taking a tranquillizer .
i guess they gave you some chemical restraints .
drugs !
what'd they give you?
thorazine?
haldol?
how much?
how much?
learn your drugs .
know your dosages .
it's elementary .
i need to make a telephone call .
a telephone call?
that's communication with the outside world .
doctor's discretion .
lfall ofthese nuts could just make phone calls ... it could spread insanity oozing through telephone cables ... oozing to the ears ofall these poor , sane people , infecting them .
wackos everywhere .
a plague of madness .
ln fact , very few, jim jim , very few of us here are actually mentally ill .
i'm not saying you're not mentally ill .
for all i know , you're crazy as a loon .
but that's not why you're here .
you're here because ofthe system .
there's the television .
it's all right there .
all right there .
look , listen , kneel , pray .
the commercials !
we're not productive any more .
don't make things .
it's all automated .
what are we for then?
we're consumers, jim .
okay , okay .
buy a lot ofstuff , you're a good citizen .
but ifyou don't buy a lot ofstuff , what are you then?
what?
you're mentally ill .
fact, jim .
fact ! lfyou don't buy things : toilet paper , new cars ... electrically operated sexual devices ... stereo systems with brain implanted headphones ... screwdrivers with built in radar devices , voice activated computers
take it easy, jeffrey .
be calm !
right .
that's right .
you're a very attractive woman .
lfyou want to watch a particular tv programme , like allmy children ... go to the nurse , tell her the day , the time the show you wanna see is on .
but you have to tell her before the show is scheduled to be on .
this guy was always requesting shows that had already played .
yes .
no .
you have to tell her before .
he couldn't grasp the idea that the nurse couldn't make it be yesterday .
she couldn't turn back time !
thankyou , einstein .
now he , he was nuts .
he was a fruitcake, jim .
okay , that's it, jeffrey .
you're gonna get a shot .
i warned you .
right .
i got a little carried away ... explaining the inner workings ofthe institution tojim .
i don't really come from outer space .
oh .
l. j. washington .
he doesn't really come from outer space .
don't mock me , my friend .
get outta my chair !
it's a condition of mental divergence .
i find myself on the planet ogo .
part ofan intellectual elite ... preparing to subjugate the barbarian hordes on pluto .
but even though this is a totally convincing reality for me in all ways ... nevertheless , ogo is actually a construct of my psyche .
i am mentally divergent ... in that i am escaping certain unnamed realities ... that plague my life here .
when i stop going there , i will be well .
are you also divergent , friend?
this is a place for crazy people .
i'm not crazy .
we don't use that term , " crazy , " mr cole .
you've got some real nuts here !
i know some things that you don't know .
it's gonna be very difficult foryou to understand it .
i'm not gonna hurt anyone !
all right .
look , have any ofyou heard ... ofthe army ofthe twelve monkeys?
they stencil this on the sides of buildings everywhere .
have you seen this?
have you seen this?
why don't you just take your time ... and try to explain this from the beginning?
right , right .
it's 1 990 .
okay , that makes sense .
they wouldn't have been active yet .
five billion people died in 1 996 and 1 997 .
almost the entire population ofthe world .
only about one percent of us survived .
are you going to save us?
how can l?
this already happened .
i can't save you .
nobody can .
i am simply trying to gather information to help the people in the present ... trace the path ofthe virus .
we're not in the present now , mr cole?
1 990 is the past .
this already happened .
that's what i'm trying
you believe 1 996 is the present then , is that it?
no !
1 996 is the past too .
listen to me .
what l
what l what i need to do is make a telephone call .
i can straighten this out if i make a telephone call .
who would you call?
who would straighten everything out?
the scientists .
they'll want to know that they sent me to the wrong time .
i can leave a voice mail message that they monitor from the present .
can i just make one telephone call , please?
please?
what are you doin 'in the dog bowl?
get outta there !
who put those doritos in there anyway?
yes?
what?
voice mail?
look , i don't know stop makin 'that noise !
i don't know what you're talkin 'about .
ls this a joke?
i don't know any scientists .
duanne , get out james who?
wasn't who you expected?
no .
it was some lady .
she didn't know anything .
well , maybe it was the wrong number .
no .
that's why they chose me .
i remember things .
james , where did you grow up?
dr railly .
i have the strangest feeling i've met you before .
wait .
this is 1 990 .
i'm supposed to be leaving messages in 1 996 !
it's not the right numberyet !
that's the problem !
lhave a message forthem .
won't work .
can't open it .
you thinkyou can remove the grill , but you can't .
it's welded .
see?
told you .
all the doors are locked too .
they're protecting the people on the outside from us ... when the people on the outside are as crazy as us .
do you know what " crazy " is?
crazy is " majority rules . " yeah .
take germs , for example .
germs?
ln the 1 8th century , no such thing .
nada .
nothing .
no one ever imagined such a thing !
no sane person , anyway .
along comes this doctor .
semmelweis !
semmelweis comes along , trying to convince people , other doctors mainly ... that there are these teeny , tiny , invisible bad things called germs ... that get into your body and make you sick .
he's trying to get doctors to wash their hands .
what is this guy?
crazy?
teeny , tiny , invisible " what do you call 'em?
germs?
what?
now , cut to the 20th century .
last week , in fact , right before i got dragged into this hellhole !
i go in to order a burger in this fast food joint .
the guy drops it on the foor .
jim , he picks it up , wipes it off .
he hands it to me like it was all okay .
what about the germs? " i say .
he says , " i don't believe in germs .
germs are a plot they made up so they can sell you disinfectants and soaps .
now , he's crazy , right?
see?
there's no right .
there's no wrong .
there's only popular opinion .
you , you , you believe in germs , right?
i'm not crazy .
ofcourse not !
you wanna escape , right?
that's very sane .
i can help you .
you want me to , don't ya?
get you out?
you know how to get outta here?
yes , my son !
then why don't ya?
why don't i try to escape?
good question .
very good question .
lntelligent .
because i would be crazy to escape .
i have sent out word .
i am all taken care of .
what does that mean?
i've managed to contact certain underlings , evil spirits ... secretaries ofsecretaries and other assorted minions ... who will contact my father .
and when my father finds out i'm in this kind of place ... he'll have them transfer me to one ofthose classyjoints ... where they treat you properly , like a person , a guest !
with sheets and towels like a big hotel ... with great drugs for all of us nut case , lunatic , maniac devils !
sorry .
sorry .
i got a little agitated .
the thought ofescape crossed my mind .
and suddenly
suddenly i felt like bending the fucking bars back !
and ripping out the window frames and eating them !
yes , eating them !
and leaping , leaping , leaping !
colonics for everyone !
i'm a mental patient .
i'm supposed to act out .
wait'll you morons find out who i am !
my father's gonna be really upset .
and when my father gets upset , the ground shakes .
my father is god !
i worship my father !
these dramatic video tapes , secretly obtainedbyanimalrightsactivists ... have arousedpublic indignation .
but manyscientists vehemently disagree .
torture experiments .
we're all monkeys .
they hurt you?
not as bad as what they're doing to the easter bunny .
look at them .
they'rejust askin 'for it .
maybe the human race deserves to be wiped out .
wiping out the human race?
it's a great idea .
it's great .
but more ofa long term thing .
first we have to focus on more immediate goals .
i didn't say a word about you know what .
what are you talking about?
your plan .
emancipation .
what are you writing?
you a reporter?
it's private .
a lawsuit?

james , we have to do this .
you're very confused .
kathryn , we've been working together for fouryears .
i've never seen you like this before .
so please stop being so defensive .
this isn't an inquisition .
i didn't think i was being defensive .
i was trying to explain exactly what
he should've been in restraints .
it was bad judgment on your part , plain and simple .
why not own up to it?
okay , it was bad judgment .
but i have the strangest feeling about him .
i've seen him before and i'm trying  two policemen are in the hospital .
now we've got a security guard with a skull fracture .
i said it was bad judgment !
what else do you want me to say?
you see that?
see what i mean?
you're being defensive .
lsn't she being defensive?
we have another situation .
he was fully restrained?
yes , sir .
i did it myself .
and he was fully sedated?
he was fully sedated .
are you trying to tell me a fully sedated , fully restrained patient ... somehow slipped out that vent , replaced the grill behind him ... and is wriggling his way through the ventilation system?
watch it !
you sure fucked up !
where are you?
ah , you can talk !
my name's not bob .
not a prob , bob .
where'd they send you?
where are you?
another cell .
maybe .
what do you mean " maybe "?
what's that supposed to mean?
maybe means ... maybe i'm in the next cell .
another volunteer like you .
or maybe i'm in the central office ... spying on ya for all those science bozos .
or , hey ... maybe i'm not even here .
maybe i'm just in your head .
no way to confirm anything .
where'd they send ya?
1 990 .
'90 !
how was it?
good drugs?
lots of pussy?
hey , bob , you do thejob?
you find out the big info?
army ofthe twelve monkeys?
it was supposed to be 1 996 .
science ain't an exact science with these clowns .
but they're getting better .
you're lucky you didn't end up in ancient egypt .
shh !
they're comin '.
the freedom foranimalsassociation on secondavenue ... is thesecret headquarters ofthearmyofthe twelve monkeys .
theyare the ones who aregoing to do it .
lcan't do anymore .
lhave togo now .
have a merry christmas .
well?
what?
did you or did you not record that message?
it's a reconstruction ofa deteriorated recording .
weak signal .
we have to put them together one word at a time .
wejust finished rebuilding this .
did you or did you not make this call?
i couldn't make any call .
you sent me to the wrong year .
it was 1 990 .
you're certain ofthat?
what'd you do with your time , cole?
did you waste it on drugs?
women?
they forced me to take drugs .
forced you?
why would someone force you to take drugs?
i was in trouble .
i got arrested .
i did what you wanted .
i got a specimen , a spider .
i didn't have anyplace to put it , so i ate it .
but you sent me to the wrong year , so it really doesn't matter .
did you see this when you went back?
no , sir , i don't think so .
what about these people?
did you see any ofthese people?
no .
oh , wait , wait .
him?
you saw that man?
maybe in the mental institution .
you were in a mental institution?
oh , god .
cole , you were sent back to make some very important observations .
you could've made a real contribution .
helped us to reclaim the planet .
as well as reducing your sentence .
the question is , cole , do you want another chance?
last connection going on .
no mistakes this time , cole .
stay alert .
keep your eyes open .
we're thinking about the spider , cole .
try and do something like that again .
just relax now .
don't fight it .
we're sending you to the third quarter of 1 996 .
right on the money .
i don't understand !
what?
i don't understand !
where am l?
i gotta find 'em !
i gotta find 'em !
help me !
i don't know where i am .
you gotta help me find 'em !
jose?
jose !
cole !
cole , where are we?
help me , cole !
oh , god , wait !
ln a season ofgreatpestilence ... there are omensanddivinations .
and one ofthe four beasts gave unto the seven angels ... seven golden vials full ofthe wrath of god ... who liveth forever and ever .
revelations .
ln the 1 4th century , according to accounts ofofficials ofthat time ... this man appeared suddenly in the village ofwyle near stonehenge ... in april of 1 362 .
using unfamiliar words and speaking in a strange accent ... the man made dire prognostications about a pestilence ... which he said would wipe out humanity in approximately 600 years .
obviously this plague doomsday scenario is considerably more compelling ... when reality supports it with a virulent disease ... whether it's the bubonic plague , small pox or alds .
now we have technological horrors as well ... such as chemical warfare , which first reared its ugly head ... during the deadly mustard gas attacks ofworld war l .
during such an attack in the french trenches in october of 1 91 7 ... we have an account ofthis soldier ... who , during an assault , was wounded by shrapnel ... and hospitalized , apparently in a state of hysteria .
doctors found he had lost all comprehension of french ... but that he spoke english fuently ... albeit in a regional dialect they didn't recognize .
the man , though physically unaffected by the gas ... was beside himself .
he claimed that he had come from the future ... that he was looking for a pure germ ... that would ultimately wipe mankind offthe face ofthe earth ... starting in the year 1 996 .
though injured , the young soldier disappeared from the hospital ... no doubt trying to carry on his mission to warn others ... and substituting for the agony ofwar ... a self inficted agony we call " the cassandra complex .
cassandra , in greek legend , was condemned to know the future ... but to be disbelieved when she foretold it .
hence , the agony offoreknowledge , plus the impotence to do anything about it .
i'm going right out to get vaccinated .
i think , dr railly , you've given alarmists a bad name .
i have?
there's real data that the planet cannot survive the excesses ofthe human race .
this is true .
proliferation ofatomic devices .
uncontrolled breeding habits .
pollution of land , sea and air .
the rape ofthe environment .
ln this context , it's obvious chicken little represents the sane vision ... and that homo sapiens 'motto , " let's go shopping " ... is the cry ofthe true lunatic .
please , dr railly .
i wonder ifyou're aware of my own studies .
see you at work tomorrow .
i'll give you a call tomorrow .
get in the car !
i've got a gun .

we don't have anything like this .
what are all those?

my notes , clues .

it's about the secret army .
the army ofthe twelve monkeys .
they're the ones that spread the virus .
that's why i'm here .
i have to find them .
that's my mission .
have to locate them because they have the virus in its pure form ... before it mutates .
when i locate them , they'll send a scientist back here .
that scientist will study the virus .
when he goes back to the present , he and the scientists will make a cure .
police officers from threejurisdictions ... apparently including specialtacticalunitpersonnel ... have nowbeen mobilizedto control thegrowing thousands ofonlookers ... here in fresno , california .
does that disturb you?
no .
thought it was about us .
thought maybe they'd captured us and arrested me .
just a joke .
i remember being very afraid for that little boy .
all alone , down that well ... not knowing ifanybody's gonna get him out .
first time i was really afraid when i was a kid .
what do you mean , " when you were a kid "?
never mind .
just a prank , a hoax .
that boy's hiding in a barn .
there are omens and divinations .
one ofthe four beasts gave unto the seven angels ... seven golden vials full ofthe wrath of god ... who liveth forever and ever .
you won't think i'm crazy when people start dying next month .
first they'll think it'sjust some weird fever .
then they'll find out .
they'll catch on .
wait .
stop here !
stop the car !
stop right here !
i was right .
they're here !
you see?
twelve monkeys !
twelve monkeys !
you believe me now?
come on !
come on !
they're here , you see?
twelve monkeys !
twelve monkeys .
come on !
twelve monkeys .
wait , wait .
wait , here .
here , do you see it?
do you see?
i see some red paint , some marks .
marks?
you think that  oh , this is ridiculous .
don't don't you do anything crazy .
or i'll hurt somebody .
i am not gonna do anything crazy , but none ofthis is what you think it is !
you can't hide from them , bob .
i said , you can't hide from them .
no , sir , ol 'bob .
don't even try .
they hear everything .
they got that tracking device on ya .
they can find you anywhere , anytime !
it's in the tooth .
right , bob?
but i fooled 'em , old buddy .
they don't have to spy on me .
i'm doing what i'm supposed to be doing .
you see?
here it is again .
see?
here , follow this paint trail .
here .
it's here , see?
i am not going
come with me !
the paint trail goes here .
let go of my arm !
james , we shouldn't be here .
goddam it !
leave me alone !
let's get out of here .
james , we shouldn't be here .
please don't kill me .
don't kill me , please !
don't kill me , don't kill me !
stick around , bitch .
are you all right?
ls he alive?
go ahead .
we're runnin 'out oftime .
you can't help him .
oh, jesus !
james , you killed him !
all i see are dead people .
come on .
come on .
you never had a gun before !
i have one now .
come on .
come on !
dragons in their pleasant palaces .
the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air ... and there came " you !
you're one of us .
this is it .
come on .
can we help you?
it'sjust a tape .
i'm looking for the army ofthe twelve monkeys .
we don't know anything about an army ofthe twelve monkeys sojust disappear .
just want some information .
didn't you hear me?
don't hurt her !
please , i'm a psychiatrist .
just do whatever he tells you to do .
he's disturbed .
he's dangerous .
pleasejust cooperate .
you want money?
we only got a few bucks .
i told you what i want .
get down .
lock that door .
lock it now !
i told you that goines would get us  shut up !
goines?
jeffrey goines?
jeffrey becomes this big star , and the media latch onto him ... because he's picketing his own father ... a famous nobel prize winning virologist .
you must have seen all that on tv .
i don't watch tv .
ls this him?
yeah , that's him , that's him .
what are you gonna do to us?
tell me more aboutjeffrey .
jeffrey started getting bored with the shit we do picketing , leafeting , letter writing stuff .
he said we were ineffectual , liberal jerk offs .
he wanted to do guerrilla actions in order to educate the public .
like this?
he let 1 00 snakes loose in the senate .
but we weren't into that kind ofstuff .
it's counterproductive .
we told him .
so he and 1 1 guys , they split off ... and formed this underground army .
the army ofthe twelve monkeys .
see?
they started planning a " human hunt .
they bought stun guns , nets and bear traps .
they were gonna go to wall street and trap lawyers and bankers .
they didn't do it , ofcourse .
they didn't do any of it .
like always , mr big shot sold his friends out .
what does that mean?
he goes on tv and gives this big news conference , tells the world ... hejust realized his dad's experiments are vital for humanity ... and that the use ofanimals is absolutely necessary ... that from now on , he, jeffrey goines , will personally supervise the labs ... to make sure all the little animals aren't going to suffer .
what is this?
people like that aren't accessible .
you can'tjust barge in on them .
it's not how the world works .
be quiet and drive the car .
i know what i'm doing .
no , you don't .
this car is stolen , and we are in big trouble .
big trouble .
lfyou don't turn yourselfover to the police , they're going to kill you .
they're going to shoot me , too , because i'm an accessory to murder .
you're all going to die .
nobody is going to die .
you're not going to save the world , okay?
you're delusional .
you've made all this up out of bits and pieces in your head .
no .
yes !
let me give you an example .
you knowjeffrey goines .
you were both patients at county hospital .
jeffrey goines was a fruitcake .
he told you that his father was a famous scientist who worked with viruses ... so you incorporated that information to this cockeyed fantasy .
he didn't say his father was a scientist .
he said his father was god .
this is insane .
prominentpsychiatrist andauthor drkathryn raillyhasbeen abducted ... bya dangerousmentalpatient , james cole .
cole was underrailly's care sixyears ago ... when he made a dramatic escape
what is the matter with your leg?
i got shot .
shot?
who shot you?
i don't know .
it was some kind ofwar .
never mind .
you wouldn't believe me anyway .
what are you doing?
we don't need gas .
i thought you didn't know how to drive .
i said i was too young to drive .
i didn't say i was stupid .
this can't go on .
lfyou have a bullet in your leg , i have to take care of it .
i'm a doctor .
i need some supplies .
meanwhile , in fresno , california ... where mining engineers continue theirattempt ... to sinka shaftparallelto the one in which ricky isbelievedtrapped ... authorities saythere isstilla chance the boymight be alive .
you shouldn't put your weight on it .
you need stitches and antibiotics .
lucky foryou , it's near the surface .
i love seeing the sun .
wait .
let me help you .
you smell so good .
you have to give yourself up .
you know that?
what are you doing? james?
i'm sorry .
what are you doing?
stop it !
what are you doing?
i'm sorry .
let go of me !
they find him?
who?
that kid , the one in the pipe .
you believe that?
they're lowering a monkey down there ... with an infrared camera strapped on him ... and a roast beefsandwich wrapped up in tin foil .
you're makin 'it up .
i shit you not , man .
life is really weird .
a monkey and a roast beefsandwich .
would that i could enjoy this opulent dinner ... and this most stimulating and exciting company ... for itself , with no sense of purpose .
but , alas , i am burdened .
for with all this excess of public attention and cacophony of praise ... there comes great responsibility .
i don't have to tell you all that the dangers ofscience ... are a timeworn threat .
from prometheus stealing fire from the gods
what friend?
i'm not expecting anyone .
but never before
this is ridiculous .
my father's giving a major address . ... to fear the power ... we have at hand .
normally , ifwe caught a guy ... sneaking around with no ld , we'd bust his ass .
excuse my french .
this one says he knows you .
since you seem to have had a few unusual associates ... we certainly would not want to arrest one ofyour closest pals .
never seen him before in my life .
feel free to torture this man , or whatever it is you do .
i'm going back to listen to my father's eloquent discourse on the perils of
i'm here about some monkeys .
monkeys?
monkeys , yes .
twelve ofthem .
arnold .
you look like shit .
you know this man?
ofcourse i know this man .
arnold pettibone .
gee , arnie , it's black tie .
i said , " drop by .
but it's dad's big do vlps , senators , secret service .
you hungry , arnie?
real killer feast we're putting on .
lots ofdead lamb , dead cow , dead pig .
shall we?
hi .
how are you?
hello .
very attractive .
the great escape , " 1 990 .
watch it !
huh?
county hospital?
am i right?
i can't do anything about what you're going to do .
i can't change anything .
i won't stop you .
i can't stop you .
i just want the information .
come on .
hi , ladies .
so nice to see you again .
watch your step on the way down .
all right .
who blabbed?
bruhns?
weller?
i just want access to the pure virus .
virus?
i need to know where and what it is .
i get it .
i see what you're up to .
it's your old plan , isn't it?
what plan?
your plan .
i don't know what you're talking about .
yes , you do .
we were in the day room watching television ... and you were upset about the desecration ofthe planet , which i understand .
then you said , " wouldn't it be great to have a germ or virus ... that would wipe out mankind and leave the animals and trees?
you're trying to confuse me .
you were so funny .
i told you my father was this famous virologist .
you said , " he could make a germ , and we could steal it .
you were so funny .
they mutate !
we live underground !
the world belongs to the dogs and cats .
we live like worms .
i just need the information !
take it easy .
you are a nutcase , completely deranged !
delusional , paranoid .
your process is all fucked up .
your information tray isjammed , man .
do you know what it is , the army ofthe twelve monkeys?
it's a collection ofspace case do gooders saving rain forests .
i have nothing to do with those bozos any more .
i've quit being the rich kid fall guy for a bunch of ineffective fanatics !
so much foryour grand plot , asshole !
my father has warned people about the dangers ... ofexperimenting with dna viruses foryears .
you processed that information through your addled , paranoid infrastructure .
lo and behold , a non profit organization ... becomes a sinister , revolutionary cabal !
this man is complete bat shit !
ladies and gentlemen ... do you realize where he thinks he comes from?
captain dan miller , the man in charge ofthe rescue operation ... sayshe has consulted with experts ... andtheyassure us there willbe no negative
lfyou ask me , the monkey's gonna eat that goddam sandwich himself .
did a man just come running through here?
hisprimaryresponsibility was to the missingboy .
policesay that the bodyofa woman ... foundstrangled in knutson state park ... couldbe kidnapping victim ...
drkathryn railly .
anybody see someone come through here?
the body wasdiscovered less than an hourago byhikers .
but we have an unconfirmedreport that the victim ... a woman in herlate20s orearly30s ... wassavagelymutilated .
earlierin the day , police located railly'sabandonedcar .
it wasfoundnot farfrom
any sign of him?
nothing .
he can'tjust disappear .
you bastard !
i could have died in there , you son ofa bitch !
what are you thinking of ... you twisted sack ofshit?
sorry i locked you in the trunk .
i'm sick ofyou .
what have you done?
did you kill somebody?
yes .
a million people , five billion people .
what?
jeffrey goines said that it was my idea about the virus .
we were in the institution .
it was all so fuzzy with the drugs .
do you think it was my idea?
do you think maybe i wiped out the human race?
nobody is gonna wipe out the human race .
not you orjeffrey or anybody else .
you've created something in your mind .
mentally divergent?
whatever .
a substitute reality ... because you don't want to deal with anything .
i would love it ifthat was true .
it can be dealt with , but only ifyou want to .
i can help you .
they're after me .
who is afteryou?
we have to get out of here .
there were policemen at that party .
party?
you went to a
never mind .
it's important you surrender instead ofthem catching you running away .
wouldn't it be great if i was crazy?
then the world would be okay .
give me the gun .
where is the gun?
i lost the gun .
i could live right here .
you got water , air , stars .
i'm gonna attract their attention .
debris .
i'm gonna attract their attention so they know where we are .
i love this world !
they're gonna tell you to put your hands on your head .
do what they say .
i love the frogs , the spiders .
i'll be with you .
i'll help you .
i won't let them
then i said something about cooperating , and he said he would do that .
so i got in the car .
thanks .
and when l
i started honking the horn , and when i got out , he was gone .
i tell you something .
you lucked out .
for a while we thought you were a body found down state , mutilated .
he wouldn't do that .
this the man he attacked?
i want to be clear about this , okay?
this man and the other one were severely beating us .
james cole didn't start it .
ln fact , he saved me .
funny thing , doctor .
maybe you can help explain it to me , you being a psychiatrist and all .
why do kidnap victims always tell us about the guys that grabbed 'em ... and they try to make us understand ... how kind these bastards really were .
it's a normal reaction to a life threatening situation .
he's sick , okay?
he thinks he comes from the future .
he lives in a meticulously constructed fantasy world that's disintegrating .
he needs help .

drrailly returnedto baltimore without makingapublicstatement .
the authorandpsychiatrist is currently in seclusion at herhome .
meantime , police havepiecedtogether a scenario oftheseries ofevents ... that began with escaped mentalpatientjames cole
sorry .
no , it's okay .
i'm just hyper alert .
i can't sleep .
did you take a sedative?
i hate those things .
they mess me up .
with the kidnapping ofthe baltimore woman, james cole ... isnowalso wantedin connection ... with the brutalslaying ofrodney wiggins , an ex convict fromardmore .

please .
ln fresno , california , the corn field that wasjammed with spectators

that little boy .
he's fine .
it wasjust a prank he and his friends pulled .

when lfoundyou
congratulations , cole .
well done .
well done .
during your interview , while you were under the infuence ... you told us you liked music .
this isn't a prison, james .
this is a hospital .
until you recoveryour equilibrium .
you're still a little disoriented .
time travel is a very stressful thing .
you stood up very well , considering .
you connected the twelve monkeys with a famous virologist and his son .
others will take over now .
we'll be back in service in months .
we'll retake the planet .
this is what you've been working for .
a full pardon .
you'll be out of here in no time .
women will want to get to know you .
i don't want your women !
i want to get well !
and you will be well, james .
soon .
you know , you people don't exist .
you're not real .
we can't travel back in time .
you're not here .
you can't trick me .
you're in my mind .
i am insane , and you are my insanity .
he not only used the word " prank " ... he said the boy was hiding in a barn .
kathryn , kathryn , he kidnapped you .
you saw him murder somebody ... and you knew there was a real possibility ... he could kill you too .
you're under tremendous emotional stress .
for god's sake , owen , listen to me .
he knew about the boy in fresno ... and he says five billion people are gonna die .
no way he could possibly know that .
you're a rational person .
you're a trained psychiatrist .
you know the difference between what's real and what's not .
what we say is the truth is what everybody accepts , right?
psychiatry is the latest religion .
we decide what's right and wrong .
we decide who's crazy or not .
i'm in trouble here .
i'm losing my faith .
yousure fuckedup , bob .
but lcan understand .
you don't wantyourmistakes pointedout toyou .
lcan relate to that , oldbob .
lknow whatyou're thinkin '.
you're thinkin'ldon't exist except inyourhead .
lcan see thatpoint ofview .
butyou couldstilltalk to me , couldn 'tya?
i saw you ... in 1 996 , in the real world .
you pulled out your teeth .
why wouldlpullout myteeth , bob?
that'sa no no .
and when didyousayyousawme?
ln 1872?
leave me alone !
yellin 'won'tgetyou whatyou want .
you have to besmart toget whatyou want .
what do i want?
you don't know whatyou want?
sureyou do , bob .
you know whatyou want .
you tell me .
tell me what i want .
to see theskyandthe ocean ... to be topside ... breathe the air ... to be with her .
lsn 't that right?
lsn 't that whatyou want?
bob?
jim halperin , philly pd .
sorry to call you so early .
you found him? ls he okay?
no , no .
au contraire , doctor .
no sign ofyour good friend , the kidnapper .
however , the plot does thicken .
i got a ballistics report here on my desk .
it says the bullet you claim you removed from cole's thigh ... is , in fact , an antique .
andallindicationsare ... it wasfiredsometime priorto the 1920s .
howabout ltake a spin down there?
this can't be .
you andlcangrab a bite to eat ... and maybe you could revise or amplify your statement .
you can't trick us , you know .
it wouldn 't work .
no , sir .
you haven't become addicted , haveyou ... to that dying world?
no , sir .
i just want to do my part to get us back on top ... in charge ofthe planet .
and i have the experience .
i know the people involved .
he really is the most qualified .
but all that behaviour .
you said we weren't real .
i don't think the human mind is meant to exist ... in two different ... whateveryou called it , dimensions?
it'sjust too stressful .
you said that yourself .
it's very confusing .
you don't know what's real and what's not .
butyou know what's realnow .
yes , sir , i do .
no , i don't know anything about ... a monkey army , doctor .
no , nothing whatsoever .
good lord , if my son was ever involved in something like that
yeah?
well , i'm sorry .
i think it's doubly inappropriate to discuss ... security matters with you , dr railly .
but if it will ease your mind ... rest assured that neither my son ... nor any other unauthorized person ... has access to potentially dangerous organisms in my laboratory .
ls that clear to you now?
thankyou so much foryour concern .
women psychiatrists !
i attended a lecture of hers once .
apocalyptic visions .
she was suddenly struck ... by the most preposterous notion aboutjeffrey .
has she succumbed to her own ...
theoretical " cassandra disease?
maybe we ought to review our security procedures .
perhaps upgrade 'em , you know?
beef'em up .
let's consider again our current information .
lfthe symptoms were first detected in philadelphia ... on december 27 , 1 996 , that makes us know that
it was released in philadelphia probably on december 1 3 , 1 996 .
and was seen sequentially after that in
san francisco , new orleans ...
rio dejaneiro ...
rome , kinshasa ...
karachi , bangkok , then peking .
that was very well done .
lfyou're in there , i have to talk to you !
it's the kidnap woman .
the one who was with the guy who tied us up .
turn offthe lights .
turn offthe light !
what's she doin '?
she's drawing attention to us .
i don't know what you're up to , but you're gonna get us in deep shit .
walkies ready , batteries charged?
i saw you !
i saw somebody in there !
secret experiments .
that's what they do .
secret , weird stuff .
notjust on animals .
i know you .
do 'em on people too down at  have you seenjames cole?
they're watching you .
takin 'pictures .
the police .
i know .
look .
i have to contactjames .
it's very , very important that he's really careful when he reaches me .
do you understand that?
good .
who'sjames?
he was with me .
he spoke to you several weeks ago .
he said that you were from the future and that you were watching him .
bolt cutters .
did you get the bolt cutters?
one dozen .
they're in the van .
the plans for the security system?
all right here , committed to memory .
you know what she's doin 'out there?
what's it say?
i can't see it .
forget about my psychiatrist and concentrate on the task at hand .
your psychiatrist?
did you just say your psychiatrist?
ex psychiatrist .
this woman was your psychiatrist ... and now she's spray painting our building?
what's it say?
what?
there's a policeman over there .
pretend you don't know me .
i want to turn myself in .
where is he?
james !
down !
no , it's okay .
i'm not crazy any more .
i mean , i am .
i'm mentally divergent .
i know that now .
i want you to help me .
i want to get better .
let's get outta here .
he's going .
go !
i've seen that before .
no , you haven't .
a guy in a ford is chasing her and some other guy i can't see .
no problem .
it's probably just another kidnapping ... featuringjeffrey's shrink .
pardon me .
make that ex shrink .
this is your leader?
a certifiable lunatic ... who told his former psychiatrist all his plans ... for god knows what wacko irresponsible schemes?
god knows what she's written on that wall !
who cares what psychiatrists write on walls?
you think i told her about the army ofthe twelve monkeys?
lmpossible !
do you know why?
do you know why?
because , you pathetically ineffectual ... and pusillanimous pretend friend to animals , i'll tell you why .
because when i had anything to do with her six years ago ... there was no such thing , i hadn't thought of it yet .
then how come she knows what's going on?
well , here's my theory on that .
when i was institutionalized , my brain was studied exhaustively ... in the guise of mental health .
i was interrogated , x rayed .
i was examined thoroughly .
then they took everything about me and put it into a computer ... where they created this model of my mind .
yes !
using that model ... they managed to generate every thought ...
i could possibly have in the next ten years ... which they then filtered through a probability matrix ofsome kind ... to determine everything i was gonna do in that period .
so , you see ... she knew i was gonna lead the army ofthe twelve monkeys ... into the pages of history before it even occurred to me .
she knows everything i'm ever gonna do before i know it myself .
how's that?
kweskin , you finish here .
i'll meet you there .
and ifyou forget one thing , i'll have you shaved , sterilized and destroyed .
jeff?
what?
you're a great man .
fuck the bozos !
he's seriously crazy .
you know that .
there .
over there .
okay .
come on .
i need a room .
thirty five bucks an hour .
an hour?
you want quarter hours?
go someplace else .
here's ... twenty five , six , seven for an hour .
deal?
one hour , honey babe .
number 64 .
sixth foor .
up the stairs , end ofthe hall .
elevator's busted .
she's not " honey babe .
she's a doctor .
my psychiatrist .
understand?
whatever gets it up foryou, jack .
tommy , this is charlie over at the globe .
you know ifwallace has a new girl?
sort ofa rookie type?
a little weird?
does fantasy acts?
okay , you were standing there looking up at the moon .
you were splashing through the water , and then what?
i thought i was in prison again .
just like that , you were in prison?
no , not really .
like you said , it was all in my mind .
you disappeared .
one minute you were there , the next minute you were gone .
did you run through the woods , or
i don't know .
i don't remember .
the boy in the well .
how did you know that wasjust a hoax?
it was?
i didn't know .
you said he was hiding in a barn !
i think i maybe saw a tv show about that ... when i was a kid where a boy
it wasn't a tv show !
it was real !
maybe this boy saw the same tv show that i did ... and he copied it .
look , you were right .
i am mentally ill .
i imagined all these things , these people .
i know they're not real .
i can trick them .
i can make them do what i want .
i worked on 'em a little bit .
i got back here to get better .
i can stay here .
what does this mean to you?
i think i had a dream about this .
you had a bullet from world war i in your leg .
