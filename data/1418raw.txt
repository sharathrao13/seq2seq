jesus .
chantal?
shouldn'tyou get that?
hello?
henry?
victor benezet here .
how areyou?
as well as can be expected under the circumstances .
that's good .
i'm sorry to call you like this , but i need you to come in .
there's a charityball tonight .
it'sjust a few questions .
lunderstandwhy you were distressedyesterday ... but we do need to make a proper report .
i'm giving the toast tonight .
and i'm looking forward to it , old boy .
can't we do this tomorrow , victor?
it's a fund raiser .
this'll only take ten minutes .
seeyou at the station , then .
arias .
yes?
hey , howyou doing?
tellmeyourspeech won'tbeinsufferablylong .
theywon't serve dinner until you're fi nished .
ifyou're hungry , write a check , because i can crawl all night .
don't bait henry .
he's nervous .
henry loves being the center ofattention , don'tyou?
excuse us , will you?
yes , go ahead .
i have a position for a good handyman ... in caseyou ever tire ofthese long policeman's hours .
nothing works around here .
i do appreciateyour coming in on such short notice , henry .
you look marvelous .
just grand .
you getyounger every day .
thankyou , victor .
you met detective owens yesterday at the house .
happy san sebastian toyou .
same toyou , mr. hearst .
i'll burn us some coffee .
nonfat milk ifyou have it .
i don't think he heard me , actually .
he reminds me a lot ofyou .
only listens when it suits him .
that's unfair , henry .
not only am i a good listener ... but i keep it all in here .
anyway , we should have this cleared up in no time .
perhaps under the circumstances , i should be calling you " captain .
oh , no .
no need for that formality .
i do apologize about the timing .
i knowyou're due across the street .
wejust need to clarify some ofthe details from your report .
your superintendent is one ofthe charity's biggest supporters .
i know , i know .
so ifyou'll help us put an end to some ofthese nagging questions why , we'll haveyou on yourway .
i would've thoughtyou'd be at the party already .
you do know how to have fun , don'tyou , victor?
tuxedo's all ready to go .
i must say , henry , you seem in high spirits ... what with all this on your doorstep .
how should i behave?
how's chantal?
waiting .
a noble quality in thatyoung woman .
something mine didn't seem to want to do .
i was sad to hear that .
we always thoughtyou made a charming couple .
charming , perhaps ... but dull , apparently .
you see the children much?
both ofmy daughters are living with their mother ... back in new york city .
must be hard during the holidays and all .
we should get on with it .
no milk?
i'm sorry .
no , thanks .
you're into charity .
why don'tyou fund raise us up a cappuccino machine ... so all the lowlifes that come through here can enjoy a solid cup ofcoffee?
i wasjust going to ask mr. hearst about the dog .
oh , yeah .
right .
the " mystery dog .
actually , i like " ghost dog .
that's got a nice ring to it .
can we start again?
i come in here likeyou ask ... and mr. congeniality here is taking a hostile mannerwith me .
it's this case , henry .
it has everyone on edge .
but it'sjust
this business is strange ... going bywhat's in the record .
but let's see .
here . january 6 .
yesterday afternoon .
you sayyou were ... outjogging with a dog .
yes .
man's best friend .
belonging to a neighbor ofyours ... named ricardi .
you ever own one?
when i was a boy , my family had great danes .
butyou don't own one now?
chantal prefers cats .
so , doyou have a cat?
too unsanitary .
chantal would want a cat , but only ifit could be sanitized .
what doyou mean?
cats are always licking themselves .
i dumped a girlfriend once because ofher damn cat .
thing had me up all night slurping away .
a dog is a lot more unsanitary ... but at least when they're sleeping , they sleep .
thankyou for that .
anyway , the messiest is a canary .
she refused that too .
but for once i stuck to my guns .
i can be quite fi rm ifi need to be .
what was his name again?
tango .
doyou write that just like " tango "?
how else would you write it , like " waltz " or " fox trot "?
when you were questioned ... you said ...
i discovered the girl .
what we're not clear about here is what the dog was doing .
so?
logically , you would expect that the dog would have found the girl .
well , i suppose it did .
butyou sayyou found her .
well , me , the dog we were together .
we found the body .
what difference does it make?
i called the police .
unless , perhaps , you think the dog called and disguised his voice .
mr. hearst ... twoyoung girls have been found strangled ... within the past 1 6 days .
it is myjob to fi nd the murderer .
you're a principal witness to the crime scene .
now , i have to make sure that the facts ofyour statements ... agree with the other facts ofthe case .
mr. hearst doesn't appear to be as distressed today .
i'm a guest here .
i'll be treated with respect , sergeant opie .
owens .
that's detective owens .
please .
o w  please !
let's all let's all relax .
everyone has somewhere else they'd like to be .
now , henry , ifyou don't mind ... please ... tell us one more time howyou came upon the girl .
ljoggedup to ricardi's like lalways do .
i grabbed the dog .
better run him a little faster , henry .
he's getting a belly as round as yours !
fuckin 'old geezer .
come on , boy .
let's go .
let's go !
this dog
he was defi nitelywith you?
what dialect doyou need this in?
yes , the dog was with me .
the dog was with me .
got it?
you're saying tango he was there .
good .
you're catching on .
tango's all right .
keeps me company on my runs .
we took the path by my house like always .
suddenlytango wasn't there .
tango , come on , boy !
i called to him , but he wouldn't come .
i could hear him .
he was growling , barking ... actingpeculiar .
that's when i turned back .
i kept calling .
tango , come on , boy .
the dog wouldn't come .
you couldn't see the girl at this point?
obviously not from the path .
but i could see tango in there moving around .
soyou ventured off into the grove .
that's when i saw her .
at fi rst i thought she was asleep .
she was almost i want to say angelic .
the way shejust lay there .
her eyes theywere dark brown .
theywere still open .
sue ellen huddy .
she was three days shy ofher 1 3th birthday .
how did you discern she was dead?
i touched her .
i mean , i put my head on her chest .
there was no heartbeat .
that was that .
the dog found the body .
that's correct .
mr. ricardi states fi rmly that you did not run the dog yesterday .
he admits that on most days you do , but notyesterday .
well , hejust doesn't remember right .
well , that may be , but in that case , your neighbor ...
miss lazzo , doesn't remember either .
and another neighbor , mr. irwin , also suffers memory loss .
in the whole area , you're the only one who remembers correctly .
who am i to believe?
them , naturally .
come on .
you're taking this personally .
i'm just trying to fi nd the truth .
you know , you enjoy hounding me .
how is that , henry?
you forget i know all your tricks .
a murder by some thug or nutcase that's average .
but when it's a pillar ofthe legal community ... that's more than just a witness
then it's banner headlines , television .
it'd help in your push to become our next police superintendent , right?
come on , victor .
confess .
see?
i gotyou .
let's sayyou're right .
everything you say .
i bag a prominent attorney ... hang his pelt on the trophywall ofmy new luxurious offices .
what aboutyour neighbors , then?
areyou saying that they're all out to getyou too?
how would i know?
whywould they be?
maybe because i'm very rich?
because i have a big house ... and a glamorous wife .
i have these things , and it happens i don't deserve them .
my looks are entirely ordinary , and i'm no genius .
mediocre people tolerate success ... when it comes to someone exceptional like a movie star or an athlete ... but when it comes to one oftheir own ... then it strikes them as being an injustice .
you agree?
i thinkwe're getting a little far afield .
interesting thing is , there were no dog prints found at the murder scene ... and we know that without the dog ... you neverwould've seen the body .
in otherwords , your ghost dog story reeks .
there were dead leaves everywhere .
how doyou make dog prints in dead leaves , detective opie?
i don't know .
tell me .
you're a tax attorney .
good at making up fantasies .
that's what they payyou for , right?
the dog was there . jesus .
hold it , now .
hold it .
hold on .
yesterday .
damn .
they're all correct about tango .
i didn't pick him up at ricardi's .
i met him out on the path .
geez .
really had me going there for a sec .
good .
he gets out sometimes , and he runs around the gardens .
halfthe time ...
ricardi doesn'tevenknow he's missing until lbring him back .
i remember now ... that i called him .
tango , come here , boy .
come on .
youjust went offwith him .
yeah , tango's my buddy .
aren'tyou?
go on .
go on .
run .
perhapsyou'll understand howour earsprick up ... every timeyourstory changes .
yes , andlcertainlyhope this one works ... because i'm banking on this lame dog story to get me off the hook .
crap .
how much longer do i gotta put up with this
owens !
you're out ofline .
good boy .
speaking ofdogs , you keepyours on a leash .
you don't need a lawsuit .
now , you listen to me , victor .
this is getting ridiculous .
when you called me , you told me it was gonna be ten minutes .
now look at this .
i'm afraid it's gonna take a little longer .
i can see the notion ofcivic duty and being a good citizen isjust a myth .
i don't rememberwho said it  you don't seem to remembervery much .
i don't rememberwho said the police will ensure public safety everywhere ... except inside a police station .
you called before anyone knew sue ellen was missing .
well , does that make me the murderer?
it says right here , " i ran home and called the police .
my god , there must have been several places closer .
i wasn't thinking .
i just ran home .
or maybeyou thought , " i'd betterwash up fi rst .
i don't likeyour tone .
and frankly , i'm beginning to fi nd yours more and more interesting .
what areyou recording?
doyou have any idea whyyou're still here?
maybeyou should call a lawyer down here .
i am a fucking lawyer !
this isjanuary 7 , 8 : 06 p. m.
sanjuan police headquarters .
i'm captain benezet .
with me is detective owens .
we're talking to mr. henry hearst .
doyou haveyour permission to tape this interview , henry?
why not?
i have nothing to hide .
thankyou .
now , then your name , age , profession and marital status .
come on .
name , age , profession and marital status , please .
youjust said my name .
fine .
whatever .
hearst .
henry buchanan hearst .
i'm 57 .
your house is called " the ilado " up on old sanjuan hill ... and you're an attorney?
yes .
senior partnerwith hearst , dean and dumet right here in town .
you must have a lot offancy computers up there in that office .
you ever surfthe net?
check out the chat rooms and the websites?
i don't know about chat rooms , but sure .
what does this have to do with anything?
any other hobbies?
computers are not my hobby .
photography is .
i have my own darkroom .
i enjoy chronicling the island's history .
and you're married .
yes .
ten years now .
and no children .
yes .
and no children .
why not?
chantal won't chantal can't have children .
she can't , or she won't?
she has a fertility problem .
what difference does it make?
you ever hear ofadopting?
you walk somebody else's dog .
that's true tact .
that's very elegant .
doyou think that's elegant?
this is what i think .
i remember that you couldn't afford law school .
i rememberyou waiting on tables .
we'd swagger in , drunk ... trotting along hot looking dolls , spending moneyyou know we didn't earn .
i think the matter at hand is payback .
that's what i think .
when detective owens arrived atyour house at 6 : 54 p. m. yesterday ... he noted thatyou were not wearingjogging clothes .
i showered .
beforeyou called?
ofcourse not .
lcalledas soonas lcamehome .
91 1 .
whatisyour emergency?
i want to report a dead body .
officers also noted thatyourwife had notyet been told about the girl .
she was in the bedroom .
it says hereyou called from the bedroom .
you had to lie down .
you were distraught .
we'd had an argument .
when you got home?
no , earlier .
please don't go into this now , victor .
it's none ofyour business !
damn it , henry !
chantal was in the bedroom .
she was not .
the dog was with you .
the dog was not .
tell me one thing that adds up ... so we can go across the street and have a good time .
it's a pity thatyou've never been to our home .
then you'd understand .
but i was .
i was there .
downstairs there's that
upstairs it gets instructive .
there's nothing real special about it .
mr. hearst didn't say " special .
he said " instructive .
thankyou .
well , let's see .
upstairs .
there's ahallway , right?
there's along hallway .
sixty feet .
possibly .
defi nitely .
i count five rooms up here .
the extra bedrooms were for the children , which were never used .
the guest bedroom was redecorated for mywife .
our old room is now mine .
in between ... the hallway .
sixty feet long .
you have separate bedrooms .
my lovely chantal's affl iction is the green eyed monster .
they say thatjealousy is all the fun you think somebody else is having .
chantal can be unbearable , i promiseyou .
she have reason to be?
regardless ofwhatyou think ofme , i do love mywife .
i've always loved her .
the only thing i everwanted was to be happywith chantal ... and have children .
but the pitter patter oflittle feet ... was not to be .
check those out .
i certainlywould like to .
it certainly pays to advertise .
ben , thomas , i caughtyou in the act .
married men should be more subtle .
where's henry?
he'll be right along .
had a business matter to tidy up .
i thought i saw him walking into the police station ... as we drove up to the valet .
he'll be right along .
well , what do we discuss now?
we've pretty much exhausted canaries and dogs .
let's talk about the fi rst murder , ifyou don't mind , down in la perla .
happenednot toolong ago , justovertwo weeks .
little girl's body was found .
paulina valera .
twelveyears old .
poorislandgirl .
mother was astreethooker living in amotelnot too faraway .
we thinkitstarted somewhere in thestreets .
paulina was luredorsheran .
either way , thekiller leftherbodyin the dump .
yeah?
tell him i'll be right out .
when i get back , henry ...
i wantyou to tell me what you were doing in la perla ... the night paulina valera was killed .
superintendent .
i'm waiting to introduce good citizen henry hearst ... in , let's see , 29 minutes .
and i'm told he's still in there .
that's right .
victor , doyou realize how important this fund raising event is?
yes , we have two dead girls .
but we also have countless children ... whose homes were blown away in the hurricane .
we have open sewers .
we have a cholera epidemic .
sir , i realize
you obviously do not .
how will the sponsors react if henry's accused?
i imagine extremely grateful that their children are safe .
just have him across the street ... by 9 : 00 , okay?
what timeyou got?
time to go .
your pulse is racing .
i'm due to give my speech !
speech?
yes , i know .
i've been told .
two patrol officers wrote down the license plate number ... ofyour range rover , which was parked in the vicinity ofthe crime scene .
your expensive vehicle attracted attention .
officers thought it might be stolen , called it in .
that puts you in the area , henry .
anytimeyou're ready .
me , i'm just hoping this is as good as ghost dog .
you know whereyou were three weeks ago , sergeant opie?
i was right here serving coffee to stand up citizens likeyourself .
i was at my sister in law's .
i had knocked back a few at the club ... andlhadthis inspiration to drop off some christmas gifts forthekids .
nameandaddress , henry .
ldon'tknowthe exactaddress , butlknow where itis .
it's maria andpaco rodriguez .
should be in the book .
chantal's older sister .
greatkids .
how areyou?
fine .
maria's done a fabulousjob with them .
merry christmas .
why didn't chantal go with you?
it's her sister .
it's complicated .
paco .
merry christmas .
i need to know more about this .
no , you don't .
i talkedtoher .
she gave up a little bit ofdirt .
she says that it's the fi rst time ... that either henry or chantal ... had stopped by in a long time .
she didn't sound too friendly .
whyyou pick that night to thaw the ice?
it has nothing to do with anything .
where'd you go next?
i went home .
police reported your car at 2 : 1 8 a. m.
you see , this is what we here at the police
we call it a window ofopportunity .
i was driving drunk .
i wasjust driving terribly .
lmostdefinitelyneeded to walk offtheliquor .
la perla's not a good idea for a man wearing armani .
it was abeautifulnight .
this place doesn't scare me .
well , it should .
so?
where did you go?
lfoundabench .
lsatdown .
lfoundabench .
lsatdown . lfellasleep .
found a bench .
woke up i don't know when .
felt better .
i went home .
what's gonna stop me from shoving my fist down his throat?
the police would rather that i drove home drunk?
all right , henry .
let's revisit this ... bench later .
first i want an answer to my question ... as to why chantal didn't accompanyyou that night .
it's between the sisters .
lmetpaco rodriguez .
he's ahotlocalartist .
busted him once smoking grass .
who doesn't on this island?
you smoke a little grass , henry?
doyou?
god knows it would help with your sunny disposition .
i'm thinking you don't fancy chantal hanging out ... with a handsome , successful younger man .
doyou?
is this necessary?
how old was chantal when you married her?
twenty .
right , henry?
you're , what , 67 , right?
i'm 57 !
goddamn it , 57 !
this is a fucking outrage .
you know that?
you've no right to pry into my private affairs ... with these soap opera insinuations .
look atyou , victor .
doing a bang upjob policing the island .
drugs everywhere .
just crime is rampant .
superintendent , my butt .
you'll be lucky ifyou still have ajob .
i'm sorry .
i'm really sorry .
this is really rather unbearable for me .
i don't suppose that ...
detective owens could get me a cold drink .
ifyou would , detective .
my pleasure .
all right , henry .
what's going on here?
doyou have anything ... a little stronger stashed away around here?
okay , victor .
what's itgonna take togetme outofhere?
we both know that i could march in an army ofattorneys .
i'm intrigued they're not here already , henry .
you're hiding something , something you don't want to get outside this room .
now it'sjustyou and me .
tell me about chantal .
you tell me about kate and consuelo .
ifhaving a difficult marriage makes me a murderer ... you'd be son ofsam .
touche .
kate and i ... married tooyoung .
she grew to want somebody better .
a man with a real job ... money to buy things she came to know ... that other men were only too happy to buy for her .
and consuelo
consuelojust hates me being a cop .
you stuckwith your guns .
you can't tell me being a cop isn't exciting .
and you obviously enjoy harassing people .
you don't see folks running up to me at cocktail soirees saying ...
gee whiz , a tax attorney .
wow .
what a cool job .
wish i could do that .
wouldn't mind whatyou got , henry .
used to be enough .
chantal's green monster ... extends to her sister's marriage .
you see , maria married for other more tried and true reasons ... despite her mother's objections .
married a man closer to her own age .
a man ofmodest means .
dashing young artist .
beautiful women .
they are a breed unto themselves .
wouldn'tyou agree?
a beautiful woman moves through life unchallenged ... men giving them everything that theywant .
first their daddies , then their boyfriends and husbands .
i'll drink to that .
for some , beauty is their only talent .
there's always somebody more beautiful .
somebodyyounger .
chantal's mother taught her that .
why areyou doing this to me , victor?
i certainly hopeyou've gotten your petty thrill pulling back the curtain .
but there's nothing more to see .
i'll tell you what i see , henry .
i see the bodies oftwoyoung girls , murdered .
the man who did that's going to answer to me .
you make me sick .
why doyou keep saying " the man who did it ... the one responsible , the killer "?
why don'tyou put a name to this phantom
henry hearst , attorney at law ifyou're so convinced that i'm guilty?
construing my marriage to be dysfunctional ... just makes it easier foryou to sell me down the river .
i'm being convinced , but not all the way .
that's whyyou're still here .
i'm still here because i choose to be .
becauseyou asked me ifi would " drop by .
becauseyou fed me this line ofcrap ... about a couple ofquestions .
but now now i'm leaving .
i've told my story to exhaustion .
i've got a ballroom full ofpeople waiting for me over there ... to give my toast in exactly 1 2 minutes .
and i've suffered enough insults and accusations for any friend to bear .
and i've suffered enough insults and accusations for any friend to bear .
you're not going anywhere , henry .
what , areyou gonna sick this knuckle dragger on me?
in that case , be careful .
be very careful , because you only have so many possibilities .
i know something about the law .
i'm gonna walk right out that door unless you book me here and now .
how about i detain you on suspicion?
areyou serious?
read him his rights .
step inside .
you have the right to remain silent .
anything you say can and will be  on what charge?
taking a nap on a bench?
walking a dog without permission?
two counts , fi rst degree murder .
special circumstances .
two counts , rape ... upon the persons ofsue ellen huddy and paulina valera .
i raped them as well , huh?
ifyou cannot afford an attorney , the court will appoint one foryou .
now , doyou understand these rights that have been explained toyou?
seeyou outside a minute , please .
he's one hundred fucking percent guilty .
he knows exactlywhere we're taking him .
yeah , you made sure ofthat .
thankyou .
now , what ifhe lawyers up?
he opens his wallet and trots in some hardball mouthpiece
that's it .
we lose him .
we already had him .
i was sleeping on a park bench .
i mean , my ass !
you're playing it soft .
why areyou butterballing him?
why don'tyou let me go in there and let me drop the hammer on that guy?
i'm gonna walk across the street .
you go back in there , and you sit with him .
and you keepyour mouth shut .
okay?
shut !
i saw victor's eyes .
and your nostrils seem to have a new flare to them .
as in , your butt got chewed for blowing the pooch .
our notorious captain would love to have ambushed me with that tidbit ... and owned the most devastating moment .
yeah .
you okaywith that?
what?
i didn't know diet or regular .
bet they're fast , huh?
excuse me?
little girls .
i bet they run really fast ... when you're chasing 'em .
you'll be running quick , too , when i fi le my lawsuit .
you're telling me toletaman whom i think in all probability ... killed twoyoung girls walk out ofthe station?
for ten minutes , victor .
has he confessed?
ofcourse not .
you have proofenough to arrest him?
i've caught him in a number oflies .
you need more than a few lies .
and until you have them ...
i don't want him retained officially .
don't tell meyou already
five minutes ago .
i thought he might take off .
he has to make his toast !
bring him here .
no uniformed officer .
no restraint ofany kind .
see to it ...
captain .
well , this is nice .
a little alone time .
you know , i likeyou , henry .
can you believe it?
a couple ofgirls strangled , raped .
and yetyou maintain a sense ofhumor about it .
raped and strangled .
what?
you said " strangled and raped .
i wouldn't know , especially ... but these things should be put in their proper order .
don'tyou agree , detective?
doyou call to them?
what do i know?
could be the poor kids , they lured you ... off into the woods and seduced you .
it happens .
you sound obsessed .
you like this sort ofthing .
i'm just curious .
i'm curious howyou operate .
now ... these little girls i bet they run like rabbits , don't they?
come on .
tell me about it .
what doyou do?
touch 'em?
you touch 'em like that?
what , did that hurt?
you hurt 'em , don'tyou?
the little girls .
doyou kiss them?
cut it out !
what's your name , sweetheart?
paulina?
that's a pretty name .
it's sexy , yeah .
areyou here all byyourself?
i am too .
cute top .
it's a tight little blouse you got on there .
god , you're a hot little cutie .
i just wanna put my

it's the captain .
line three .
he what?
never mind , owens .
never mind !
just bring him here .
bring him here now !
he has aspeech tomake .
when you've fixed your rug , i gotta run you over .
haven'tyou done that already?
would you please getyour hands off me?
please !
my god , henry !
what happened?
haveyou met my new tailor and hairstylist ... the " marquis de fucking sade "?
look !
this is nothing less than assault and battery , and i have witnesses !
witnesses to what?
you knocked me down the stairs !
you attempted to escape !
that's bullshit !
come on !
let's go have a serious discu  just cut the crap .
what?
henry , people are depending on you .
shut up . just shut up .
shut up, julio .
doyou mind?
ruthanne , you're looking lovely , as usual .
henry , is everything okay?
yes , fi ne .
thankyou very much .
it's all right .
isabella , hola .
wait .
just pray that i'm guilty ofkilling those girls ... because ifi am , then your boys worked over a monster .
it'll be brushed under the carpet .
but ifl'm not , the monster changes sides .
henry , just give us that money smile .
shit .
good evening , ladies and gentlemen .
happy san sebastian .
i'm proud to introduce a man ... who along with his lovelywife chantal hearst ... has championed many charity causes in puerto rico .
and in the wake of hurricane lucy , we need him more than ever .
so , henry , get over here and empty these people's pockets .
where's his fucking hair?
had the damn thing upside down .
thankyou very much for coming tonight .
whereyou been?
got a lot ofcatchin 'up to do .
i'm right behind you .
when nature sends its worst , it's as ifone ofgod's checks has bounced .
let's prayyour checks don't .
because that's whywe're here .
hurricane lucy ripped across
they say no amount oflearning can cure stupidity .
you're certainly a candidate for  ifhe'd cracked , you'd have come back
well , he didn't crack , and you're off this investigation .
what?
don't , detective .
learn the grammar ofsilence whileyou still hold that rank .
now , you go back to the station .
go home .
put on a silly hat .
do whatever morons do .
the island is a family , one that has been torn apart .
we need to be there for each other , especially for our children .
for there's no greater gift than a child's smile .
i want him back .
now .
tonight .
not tomorrow .
victor , don't underestimate ... the resolve of henry hearst and his law fi rm ... to raiseyour severed head on a pole ... and wave it for the whole damn island to see .
we'll see whose head gets waved on that pole .
well , that's your decision , then ... isn't it?
in closing , i'd like to askyou to look intoyour hearts ... realize what truly matters in life ... and fi nd the love to help our family .
perhaps catastrophe ... is the natural human environment .
we fi nd ourselves attacked by unforeseen forces come to harm us ... even though we are innocent ofanywrongdoing .
but it is human nature to overcome , ifwe work together .
so , please , help me help the children .
thankyou .
you know , as ifi wasn't embarrassed enough ... youjerked me out ofthere without being able to chat or have dinner .
i'm hungry , damn it !
you like chocolate?
there's a whole machine full ofit in the hallway ... and i knowyou've got money .
you can't treat me like this .
ofcourse i can !
you'll eat , henry .
food is the least ofyour problems .
i'm going to do the best i can to seeyou get three squares a day .
come with me .
will you hold my husband all night?
how long could that be?
would you like to have a private chat with yourwife?
this is detective castillo .
he's going to set up a video camera in here while i chat with chantal .
why mustyou question her?
detective castillo will getyou some food .
i should tell you the  do it outside .
victor , i need to know what's happening .
just give me a moment while i close the door .
she came in she was to me
is henry here?
can i see him?
i need to see him .
doesn't want to talk toyou .
ifhe's innocent , why is this taking so long?
i never said he was innocent .
tell me aboutyour lives together as a couple .
you could start with the separate bedrooms .
he talked about that?
and what else?
your sister .
don'tyou offer to light a lady's cigarette?
tell me about the night he ... visited your sister's home .
what night would that be?
december 1 9 , sunday night , about 9 : 00 in the evening .
i fi nd it curious thatyou chose not to accompany him .
i wasn't aware henry had visited my sister .
whywouldn't he tell you?
obviously henry has talked to us aboutyour marriage ... howyou wish you had married someone closer toyour age , like paco .
you're saying henry'sjealous ofmy sister's husband?
areyou having an affair with paco?
am i on trial now?
can you tell me what time he got home that night?
there was a night that could be it .
lrememberthe frontdoor .
it's old , veryheavy .
it tends to slam .
did you look at the clock?
you must've been worried .
this wasn't the fi rst time .
hello?
take me into that room .
why don'tyou answer me?
andyoudidn'tpursueit? or didn't youcare toask where he was?
we don't ask those sort ofquestions anymore .
but i'm sure you're going to tell me .
we have reason to believe he was in la perla ... where a young girl named paulina valera was raped and murdered ... and left on a garbage dump .
i need to know whose name the house is in .
the house was a gift .
then may i haveyour permission to search the house?
you may not .
you said you were hungry .
what'd she say?
you all set , castillo?
yes , sir .
start recording .
i was talking toyou .
that's right .
victor only listens when it suits victor .
i listen , henry .
i was listening when you told me you left your sister in law's ... and drove to la perla , thatyou went for a walk and fell asleep on a bench .
now i'd like to hear something that vaguely resembles the truth .
that is the truth .
chantal says you got home at 3 : 30 a. m.
i told you i went for a walk .
i was drunk .
i
i may have had another drink .
you happen onto via del mar boulevard?
doyou want toparty with me?
whatdoyou want?
did you see any hookers?
no .
you didn't talk to any hookers?
no .
spend time with one , perhaps?
absolutely not .
you're lying , henry .
your carotid artery is pumping like crazy .
and your eyes they turn down and to the left .
that's what liars do .
it's a fact .
our bodies give us away .
doyou know what these do?
they keep me awake .
i haven't been sleeping much .
sinceyou found sue ellen huddy's body , i've been working straight through .
and i've got so much to share with you .
for instance , i accompanied those two officers ... who phoned in the license number from your range rover .
we went back to la perla .
they showed me exactlywhereyou parked .
we conducted some interviews .
imagine my surprise when several prostitutes recognized your photo ... said you'd been coming around for months .
jesus christ , victor , she's in the next room .
i'm talking about street hookers , needle users , crackheads ... not high class call girls .
curb crawlers , for god's sake .
my god .
that old carotid artery is pumping like gangbusters .
god damn you .
chantal can't hearyou , not with the door closed .
unless i turn the speaker on .
please .
she was blond .
obviously peroxide , being hispanic .
she would truly have been beautiful without all that makeup .
i never knew her name .
doyou miss me , huh?
yes , you do .
i left my sister in law's house ... to have sex in an alley with a prostitute .
i be a good little girl foryou .
little girl .
i fi nished myselfoff ... drinking any goddamn thing i wanted at the sunshine cafe .
a whiskey .
what doyou think?
that i'd spend my life banging on mywife's mywife's door?
i'd fi nd a substitute ... someonejust the opposite from chantal .
a prostitute is a woman who will giveyou a great deal ... for relatively little money .
well , as an alibi , i don't know , henry .
a lot ofwomen in puerto rico die their hair blond ... especially in that profession , but i'll tell you what i do know .
one ofthem admittedshe'dbeen withyou last week .
hername was reina .
doyou know this man?
no .
yes .
she was young , much younger than the others .
and she says that's whyyou like her .
but this must be an old picture .
why?
the guy's bald now .
bald?
mm hmm .
you removeyour hairpiece down there as well , don'tyou , henry?
it seems nobody remembers you with the rug .
trying not to be recognized .
that's smart .
pick 'em up inyour car , somebodymightcatch alicenseplate .
" this one likes it quick "  from behind .
he pumps me hard .
at least he comes fast .
then goes like he doesn't want to be here .
but i like it fast .
gets me back
... into my corner .
but a week ago is no alibi , is it , henry?
why , henry?
why here like this ... in the dirt?
think ofthehigh class escorts youcanbuy .
suites at the ritz .
dom perignon .
and you choose this .
don't tell her , will you , victor?
please .
i imagine chantal will be thrilled to learn you were with a prostitute ... instead ofwhat you were really doing .
rapists leave bodily fluids semen ...
dna .
your test'll prove that it wasn't me .
you use condoms with your prostitutes?
ofcourse .
what kind?
i don't know .
trojans .
whatever they have .
the killer used condoms .
chemical lubricants were found in the victims .
he's smart , likeyou .
knows all about our lab tests .
both victims were rapedfrom behind .
both victims were strangledfrom behind .
thumbandfingerprints on the victims'necks confirmedthis .
areyou here all byyourself?
then you put the clothes back on .
dirtandleaves inside thegarments confirmedthis , as well .
prettyblouseyouhave on there .
then you pose them .
each on theside ...
little heads resting on cupped hands .
and you combed their hair .
the lack ofdebris suggests this .
and we have reason to believeyou took their photograph .
stop it !
photography is your hobby , isn't it?
isn't it?
stop it !
what's wrong?
you all right?
i'm fi ne .
what's wrong?
you all right?
i'm fi ne .
you want some water?
no .
i'm perfectly fi ne .
i've never been better .
i'm just tired .
you don't look exactly fresh as a daisyyourself .
you surf , henry?
the internet?
this is a statement from yourweb browser provider .
your e mail address is hhearst@ elpuerto . com .
you sometimes use an on line alias . " hard body hank "?
very catchy .
god , does this ever end?
a simpleyes or no , henry .
yes .
yes .
it seems that hard body hank has visited several pornography sites ... one ofwhich is called barely legal .
it features young ladies posed as schoolgirls .
that website features women , not children .
christ .
every time i check e mail , there's a new message from some electronic bimbo ...
luring me to her site .
so i checked it out a few times .
what's the big deal?
and the prostitutes what does that prove?
that i'm lonely?
that i don't get it at home?
that mywife makes me sleep down the hall?
and all this makes me a pedophile , a rapist , a killer ofchildren?
whywould i do such a thing?
i don't know , henry .
notyet .
let's talk about this glamorous wife who keeps poor henry shivering in the hall .
you know what chantal says?
she's lying !
whatever she said .
i never touched camille .
who's camille?
all right , mrs. hearst .
let's talk aboutyour separate bedrooms .
henry says it was his choice ; he moved out .
he's wrong .
he's wrong or he's lying?
let's not quibble overwords .
but words can be very amusing .
words like " conjugal duty , " for instance ... which henry claims you have not been performing with willing good spirits .
to be honest , he says you're not performing at all .
he has been revealing things , hasn't he?
i'd like to hearyour side .
the most interesting things those i'm sure he kept to himself .
not camille , i'm afraid .
that is the reason you sent him down the hall with his toothbrush and washcloth?
he's out there ... afraid , hoping for a miracle ... that one day things will turn out all right ... as long as nobody speaks ofthem .
he's right to .
to what?
hope?
to be afraid .
christmas day , twoyears ago .
we always used to spend christmas with maria and paco .
ofcourse this was before .
yeah .
that's what i understand .
i couldn't wait to see my niece .
camille .
their children were special ... with an extra share ofmagic ... andgraceandpurity .
camille was one ofthem .
henryandl were extremely fondofher .
how areyou?
they seem very close .
don't they?
you look great !
you too .
we were allhaving agoodtime , the way families shouldbeat christmas .
but then henrygotdrunk .
red , anybody?
no , thanks .
you've already poured it out .
i have .
he startedmaking remarks ...
please excuse my husband . aboutmeandpaco .
excuse the husband , yeah .
something paco seems very adept at .
it was embarrassing .
henry .
i was angry .
this the fi rst time?
no .
ls itsomekindofsecret thatpaco finds my chantalenchanting?
henry , don't .
so what did you do?
don't what?
i told him to shut up .
just don't .
afterdinner ...
maria and i opened our presents .
books forme ...
thanks . she wantedtoread ... andjewelry forher thatl wantedto wear .
why i got up when i did , i don't know .
unless youcallintuitionareason .
but he wasn't there .
something ledme toward thebedrooms .
i don't get it .
come here .
theywere there ...
let me see . in herroom .
yes .
thankyou .
he was talking , andshe was listening .
lcouldn't tellyou whathe was saying ... but the wayhe talkedtoher ... was the way you talk toa woman .
lrememberhowshesmiled , thelookin hereyes .
he had no right to make her smile that way .
and you continued to stay together ... each atyour own separate ends ofthe hall .
and you never had sex since?
you're putting on quite a show for henry , aren'tyou?
right now , he can't hearyou .
once a woman decides that's it's not important
even when i would try toget things back tonormal ... that image was always with me .
and sinceyou can't have children
ofcourse i can .
would you mind telling me how old you were when you and henry met?
i think i was about 1 1 when we came over from europe .
henry became my father's attorney here .
they sailed together .
he was always around .
in our families , you could always fi nd some friend ofyour father's ... with a boat in st. thomas or a penthouse in manhattan .
and that man was henry .
now , your father
he died when you were what?
fourteen .
and henry becameyour surrogate father?
he paid for my college .
and that's when you became lovers?
i wasn't interested in boys my age .
spring break .
i couldn't wait .
we did it on henry's yacht , then in hotels ... in cars , on beaches , everywhere .
he was different with me .
he was tender .
we had a time , henry and i.
i can imagine .
so can you imagine his anger ... at not being able to make love toyou now?
i've seen it .
you've seen it?
as in , he raped you?
rape is an act ofanger .
it's about control , not about sex .
henrywas a very angry man .
doyou think he's guilty?
doyou?
that night , he visited your sister's home .
did you notice any scratches on him , signs ofstruggle?
i can't remember .
i need to get my hands on the clothes he was wearing that night .
please .
give me permission to search your house .
becauseyou sawyour husband talking toyour niece on christmas eve ... you've thrown him out ofyour bedroom and haven't slept with him in twoyears .
now , don'tyou think that's a little bit harsh?
stop trying to bait me .
what doyou call a beautiful young woman who'sjealous ofher 1 3 year old niece?
honest . " honest . " i don't know who's more fucked up , you or him .
i'm sorry .
but don'tyou want to know you've been right about him?
don'tyou?
don't make a mess .
castillo?
take a squad ofmen .
escort mrs. hearst back to her house .
yes , sir .
castillo , search the house .
yes , sir .
say it .
go on .
say it .
she tells you about camille , everything falls into place .
there's no need to even ask my side ofthe story .
i'mjack the ripper , jekyil and hyde , big , bad wolf .
i'll remind you , henry .
i've heard your story all night , and you've been lying .
detective .
you got a problem?
huh?
all right .
let's go .
sitdown , henry .
sitdown , henry .
going man to man now , are we?
shall i roll up my sleeves?
christmas .
twoyears ago .
you and camille .
letmesee .
ldon'tgetit .
it was nothing , absolutelynothing .
camille draggedmeintoherroom toshow offa christmas gift from hermother .
evenaknuckleheadshouldbeable to  she was high onasugarrush ... frompumpkinpie .
this would look good on you .
couldn'tkeep still .
smile .
so chantal overreacted?
chantal never letyou touch her after that?
infidelity ... money , long illness .
i'm separated from mywife by a hallway , a 60 foot hallway .
ln fact , it's a desert , thathallway .
andat the very end , there's a door .
and when it's locked , you can knock all you want ... but thatdoor won'topen .
why doyouholdon?
whynotjustgeta divorce?
just trade one nightmare for another .
let's add it up : halfmy money , the house .
i'd end up living over somebody's reconverted garage .
oh , yeah , and then there's half my share ofthe law fi rm .
that's bullshit , henry .
it's vanity , pure and simple .
being with her puts you on everybody's a list .
you're puerto rico's glamour couple .
ah !
henry and chantal hearst !
they're so in love !
just full ofcompliments , aren't we?
that's whyyou stay married .
at our age , fi nding anotherwoman like that's not so easy .
not so easy ifyou're taking them back ... toyour third floorwalk up piece ofshit $500 a month studio apartment .
is that whatyou mean , victor?
well , we can't all afford ... to wine and dine classy , sophisticated ladies we meet in la perla , can we?
just who'd yourwife fi nd you with before she relocated in such a hurry?
fuckyou , henry .
whoops .
tell me .
sue ellen huddy .
did you know herwell orjust in passing?
not well .
notatall .
it's impossible foramanmyage toknowa 12 year oldreally well .
to knowa 12 year oldreally well .
bags .
throw me the bags .
thanks .
the darkroom .
there was no dog in there .
there was onlyyou .
we don'thave any evidence ofastruggle ... so it had to be somebody very good with children ... or someone she knew .
did you kick the ball around with her , henry?
did you laugh and play with her fi rst?
or did youjust take her?
was itas exciting as paulina valera?
tell me , henry !
go to hell .
you dressed her again .
you posed her .
we'll fi nd the brush , henry .
we'll fi nd the brush you used .
we'll fi nd the brush you used to get her hairjust right .
your trophy .
youmet chantal whenshe was 1 1 .
youmoldedapleasure model .
ls that whatyou think childrenare for?
topleasureyou?
you peel my onion down to the nub .
areyou trying to tell me thatyou don't like them young?
you're twice divorced , single with a vengeance .
who doyou talk to in a martini bar?
the best looking girl you can get awaywith , that's who .
and she's not 50 .
probably mid 30s .
ofcourse , in their 20s hey .
now we're talking .
and how about teenage girls?
we loved them then .
why should anything change now?
what does he possibly see in a girl thatyoung?
what in the world do they talk about?
ifi want to discuss the s& p 500 , i'll call my broker .
young girls don't talk .
they laugh .
they live .
they're in the moment .
and every night is the night .
and their bodies are hard and tight ... and smooth ... the way skin is supposed to be .
and saying so ... doesn't make me a pervert .
men can't say shit anymore .
we're all browbeaten byyouth obsessed old bitches fresh from chemical peels .
still want us to open their doors , pay theirway .
yes , victor , i loveyoung women .
at least i'm honest enough to say so .
one hundred fucking percent guilty .
owens .
we found them , sir .
she come backwith you?
yeah .
put her in there .
all right .
all right , but only ifyou promise to keepyour mouth shut until i'm ready .
you're welcome .
you can sit right here .
check the recorder .
there should be enough tape ... though i don't think we'll need much more .
have a seat , henry .
she's in there watching?
what's he saying?
you're good athiding behindthings .
sitdown , henry ... andtell us onemore timeaboutyour relationship with thesecondvictim ...
sue ellen huddy .
your relationship with the murdervictim , sue ellen huddy the little girl you claim you found by thejogging path .
she thinks that i did this .
i'llask the question onemore time .
what was your relationship to the murdered girl , sue ellen huddy?
there was none .
none?
no .
none .
i saw her by the house on occasion .
shelivedin theneighborhood .
i might have spoke to her once or twice ... ifever .
a greeting , per perhaps .
here's what i believe , henry .
you're bored .
you're unhappy .
you have a history with veryyoung girls .
you've been placed at the scene ofthe fi rst murder .
your attempt at an alibi was to kill a second young girl .
you're in love with someone who doesn't loveyou ... just whoyou were .
you're very , very lonely .
i'll tell you what i believe ... whatlknow ... whatlhaveproofof .
can you tell me who that is?
sue ellen .
aportraitlike that takes time , henry .
and this little girl?
chantal was nice enough to bring these out ofyour darkroom .
youmakelovelyphotographs , henry .
i can't believe that she would go these lengths ...
to make this kind ofpoint .
it's almost farcical .
you killed sue ellen huddy .
yes .
and paulina valera?
yes .
both ofthem?
yes , both ofthem .
raped and murdered them .
i'm the one .
areyouprepared tomakeastatement?
what else am i doing?
well , let's
let's begin with the first victim , little paulina .
takeyour time .

go on , henry .
i'll be right back .
you saw her on the doorstep .
