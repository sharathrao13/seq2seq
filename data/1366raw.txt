he's an elegant dancer .
we'll panic them after a few rehearsals .

well , young fella , i guess 100 a week ought to buy you .
that's more than i generally start with .

you'll never be sorry for this .

it's just a little good luck charm i carry around with me .
is that your racket?
maybe .
i suppose i got no right to ask you , joe .
but now ...
now that we got an understanding .
couldn't you leave it?
no .
i suppose i haven't got the right .
what would be the good of you asking , kid?
once in a gang ...
you know the rest .
i don't want to know .
only maybe ...
maybe it could be different this time .
if we try .
i've never seen the guy that could get away with it yet .
black .

sam vettori is still waiting for you in your office .
all right , i guess i'll have to see him .
i wonder what he wants here .
hey , ritz .

i'll need you in there .
that sam vettori's a no good lug .
you said it , boss .

the big boy says ...
just a minute , boss .
hey , you .
nobody asked you to be butting in here , did they?
screw , mug .
you ain't giving me orders .
you're a fresh guy , huh?
take it easy , rico .
you go out there and wait for me .
jake with me , boss .
now , listen , boys .
watch this guy mcclure ... ... what's head of the new crime commission .
he's putting the screws on , and make no mistake about him .
now , the big boy wants me to tell you guys ... ... to put the chains on your gorillas for the next few months .
because if any of them go too far , it'll be just too bad .
i've never seen nobody the big boy couldn't get to .
he can fix anything .
that's why he's the big boy .
this bird mcclure will be pie for him .
he'll twist him around his little finger .
don't kid yourself .
nobody's squaring nothing with mcclure .
not even the big boy .
small jobs , that's different .
we could spring guys for them .
but shooting?
no , sir .
it's guys like this torpedo of yours that cause all the trouble .
who , rico?
he's all right .
he's a little quick on the trigger , but that's because he's new .
yeah?
well , it's us that'll swing for him ... ... if he shoots at the wrong time .
now , remember what i told you .
come on .
so long .
and you .
you take it easy with that cannon of yours .
did you hear me?
yes , mr. montana .
good night .
good night .
good night .
good night .
do yourself a favor , will you , rico?
leave your gat home on the piano the next job you pull .
yeah , park it next to your milk bottle .
hey .
run your own mob , arnie .
i'll take care of mine .
yeah , i'll park it .
i don't need no cannon to take care of guys like you , mr. lorch .
yeah , we gotta be careful .
little arnie's interested in this here nightclub .
lf it ever gets out who pulled the job ...
they'll never get wise to us .
they're careless , but they've never been tapped .
yeah , but i don't like the whole business .
neither do i , sam .
honest , i don't .
i couldn't sleep last night .
i was up worried .
i don't want to take any chances .
not now the way they're closing down on us .
what's the matter , tony , getting yellow?
no , but , jeez , none of us wanna hang , do we?
you'd like to quit , wouldn't you?
you'd like to run out on us .
you're yellow , you dirty ...
wait a minute , rico .
where do you get that yellow stuff?
you want to know who's yellow , i'll tell you .
joe massara , your pal .
that's why he didn't show tonight .
he'll be here .
just because ...
i know all about that stuff .
i'm gonna give him 10 minutes more .
then we'll see .
now , listen , sam , joe's all right .
he's the best front man in the world .
why , he can go to a swell hotel and order a suite , a suite , and it's all right .
without joe , we can't pull the job , and you know it .
what's that paper?
it's this layout i've been figuring out with scabby .
what , this nightclub job?
yeah .
well , let me see it .
and until i say different ... ... nobody's gonna plan for this mob but me .
you get me?
he'll learn .
now , come here , you guys .
now , get this .
hello , joe .
hello , rico .

i told you to be here at 8 : 30 .
oh , well , you see , i ...
i was busy .
i was rehearsing , and ...
oh , you know how it is .
yeah , i know how it is .
they've been saying it , only i didn't believe them .
they're crazy when they call you yellow .
tell them they can go to ...
say , what's the big idea of the rush anyway?
it's a little job we need you for .
a little job at the bronze peacock .
what do you mean?
are you trying to kid me or something?
how can i take the chance?
they're all my friends , they all know me .
that's why , they'll never suspect you .
now , don't stall , joe .
i ain't stalling .
you gotta get me out of this , rico .
you gotta .
i don't want to ...
well , don't you see , i'm working steady now , and ...
can't a guy ever say he's through?
you're gonna be in on this , and you'll like it .

well , maybe it ain't so hot .
maybe we can't buck little arnie .
i can .
you're too good , that's what .
hello , joe .
you were in a big hurry about getting here , weren't you?
maybe this kind of work ain't to your liking .
joe's all right .
he's in with us .
yeah , i'm in with you .
well , let's see , now .
here's the way i dope this thing out .
i , sam vettori , not you , rico , or nobody else .

only , who stands here?
you kind of forgot that , didn't you?
hey , i'm boss on this job , not you .
right here .
smart guy , rico .
he's got plenty of brains .
i tell you , i'm afraid , otero .
i'm afraid .
you're crazy .
rico's coming with us .
come on now , buck up .
and you , joe .
you'll be in the lobby and give us the high sign ... ... if everything's on the up and up .
you get me?
yeah , and if we get in a jam , you'll have to take a chance with the rest of us .
hey , quiet , quiet .
holy moses , it's alvin mcclure .
the crime commission buzzard .
hey , de voss .

thank you .
delighted to have you with us , folks .
mr. mcclure , a mr. lorch , a financial backer of mine ... ... would like to meet you .
may i bring him over to your table?
lorch?
lorch?
you mean the man they call little arnie?
yes , but ...
you say he's a financial backer of yours?
yes , but ...
i didn't understand that a man ... ... of his type was connected with this place .
i'm sorry , de voss , but you might inform mr. lorch that we're leaving .
i came to this place under a misapprehension .
now , mr. mcclure ...
i'm sorry , folks ... ... but we'll have to go somewhere else .
you like my hair this way , joey?
sure .
i used to wear it ...
where are you going?
just to get a package of cigarettes .
hurry back , darling , it's almost 12 : 00 ... ... and i wanna be with you for new year's .
i'll be back in a minute .
what can i get you?
a victor noble .
stay where you are .
oh , help !
oh , god !
open her up , tony , this ain't no picnic .
what's the matter , tony , losing your nerve?
come on , let's go .
let's go , we gotta get out of here .
come on .
happy new year .
why , joe ...
joey .
what is it?
what's the matter?
nothing .
it's all right .
the joint's been held up , that's all .
held up?
they ...
they shot mcclure .
joe .
now you know .
it was you .
no .
no , it's a lie !
l ...
you shot mcclure .
no , i didn't , i swear .
it wasn't me that shot him .
it was ...
i don't know who .
but it's our hips for this job , all right .
maybe ...
maybe everything will be all right , joey .
maybe he wasn't hurt badly .
but you're through with that bunch .
you don't belong , joe .
you're not that kind .
you'll never go near them again .
olga ... ... you can't go back ... ... on a gang .
well , everything come off all right?
tell me .
everything was all right .
only i had to take care of a guy .
who was it?
mcclure .
mcclure .
you shot mcclure .
a million guys in this town , and you had to pick the crime commissioner .
what did i tell you , rico?
didn't i say to make it clean?
didn't i say no gunplay?
think i'm going to let a guy pull a gat on me?
any more of these cracks , and this is my last job .
the head of the crime commission .
the big boy can't do us no good this trip .
they'll get us dead sure now .
what am i gonna do?
why don't you go and give yourself up?
you're slipping , sam .
and tony , what about him?
where is he?
getting rid of the car .
tony got nervous .
he's like a big baby .
what a fine pickle we're in .
you and that rod of yours .
flaherty's downstairs , a couple of dicks with him .
they're coming right up .
stay where you are , all of you .
they won't know nothing unless they picked tony up .
give them the shaft .
i'll be in here listening .
happy new year , boys .
say , there's a lonesome touring car down the street .
i was wondering if you happened to know anything about it .
how should i know anything about it?
ain't it got license plates on it?
yes , but they're phony .
it was stolen on the north side tonight .
oh , i got a good cafe business .
i don't know nothing about automobiles what's been stolen .
well , you might if some of the bright young men around here ... ... had anything to do with it , wouldn't you?
wasn't there anybody in it?
yes , one guy .
but not when we got there .
he beat it .
but we got a good description of him , though .
i'm telling you , i don't know nothing about it .
well , come on , fellas .
as long as vettori doesn't know anything about it .
oh , say , have you heard the news , vettori?
no , what?
someone knocked off alvin mcclure over at the bronze peacock .
mcclure?
no , that's terrible .
some guys are sure careless with the lead , all right .
what a tough break for arnie .
it's gonna be a tough break for a lot of birds .
well , so long .
oh , i forgot to wish you fellas a merry christmas .
tony , i can't figure him .
the kid's a great driver .
oh , he must've lost his nerve .
i'll take care of him .
let's see the color of that money .
just a minute , sam .
i got my own ideas of a split .
and you can take it or leave it .
we ain't begging you .
yeah , well i bossed this job ... ... and i'm gonna get my split .
how'd you boss this job?
by sitting here cheating at solitaire?
well , that don't go no more , not with me .
we're done .
i've taken orders from you too long .
you'll keep on taking orders too ... ... or you'll get out of here so fast ...
maybe it won't be me that gets out .
no?
well , maybe the boys have got something to say about that .
what about it?
so , that's it , huh?
yeah , that's it , all right .
you can dish it out , but you're getting so you can't take it no more .
you're through .
well?
well , the split's okay with me , rico .
how about you boys?
no hard feelings , sam?
we gotta stick together .
there's a rope around my neck right now , and they only hang you once .
if anybody turns yellow and squeals ... ... my gun's gonna speak its peace .
what's the matter , antonio?
why you don't sleep?
you sick , maybe?
yeah .
oh , what ...
no , can't a guy get up when he wants ... ... without answering a lot of questions?
you stay out late nights , you drink lot of wine .
leave me alone .
oh , listen , antonio , i ...

and give my love to miss manccia , will you?
father mcneil .
hey , tony .

i'm looking all over for you .
rico wants you to come and get your split .
what's the matter , tony?
don't you want a split?
are you crazy?
i'm not crazy .
and i don't want no split .
listen , tony .
rico knows you lose your nerve .
now , he wants you to be a man .
you better not turn yellow .
get away from me , otero .
leave me alone !
listen , kid .
i'm trying to tell you for your own good .
come with me and get your split .
hey , tony !
tony , where you going?
i'm going to see father mcneil .
rico !
i found tony , but it's too late .
he's crazy !
crazy !
i tell him to be a man , but he shakes his head and goes to the priest .
well , i guess that's that .
we ain't got any time to lose .
come on , sam , get a car , and let's go .
not me !
take ...
take scabby .
scabby's no good .

all right , let's go .
we'll use the black roadster .
there he is .
tony !
did you see all them wreaths?
that hearse is sure decked out pretty .
well , this was no time to be tight with money .
tony deserved a swell send off .
poor kid .
yeah , but rico's wreath beat them all .
it was big .
and all it had on it was " tony .
not even rico's name .
yeah .
rico's no braggart .
tony looked like he was asleep .
didn't look a bit changed .
beats me how they do it .
got a match?
look , rico .
there's flaherty , the bull .
things must be getting pretty hot .
what's he want?
he's just stalling .
they ain't got a thing on me .
gee , we're moving slow .
we got plenty of time .
the banquet won't start until 8 .
yeah .
too bad tony won't be there .
yeah , that's the goods , all right .
that's the fanciest i've ever seen , sam .
look at those little turtledoves down here .
friendship and loyalty , huh?
well , how do you like that , sam?
pretty good , rico .
otero told me i don't look good in a derby .
what do you think?
looks just like you .
i thought so .
i guess i'll stick to them from now on .
compliments to a true pal .
mr. c. bandello from a true pal ... ... mr. sam vettori . " well , that's nice .
i appreciate , sam .
that's swell of you .
what's the matter with you birds?
don't you know how to act at a banquet?
what do you think you are , a lot of gashouse yaps?
well , cut the chatter .
scabby's gonna make a speech .
well , folks ... ... you all know what we're here for ... ... so what's the good of me telling you all about it?
rico here is a great guy !

i want to thank you , fellas , for this here banquet .
it sure is swell .
the liquor is good , so they tell me .
but i don't drink it , myself .
and the food don't leave nothing to be desired .
well , i guess we're all having a swell time ... ... and it sure is good to see all you gents with your molls here .
yeah .
well , i ...
i guess that's about all .
and i wish you birds wouldn't get drunk and raise cain ... ... because that's the way a lot of birds get bumped off .
yeah .
lay off that stuff .
i know what i'm ...
a couple of newspaper guys wanna take a picture .
what do you say , boss?
well , what do you think of that , huh?
sure .
send them in .
tell them to make it snappy .
i'll see you later .
oh , don't go away .
we're going to have our pictures taken .
i haven't had my picture taken ... ... in the last 15 years .
well , what do you think of that?
15 years , he hasn't ...
come on , boys , make it snappy .
come on , now !
quiet , everybody !
we're gonna get mugged !
there you are .
now , hold it .
hold it , still !
look at the guys over there .
that was a bad play you made then , rico .
that flashlight .
they might pick you up on that .
well , what do i care?
don't i want folks to see what the boys think of me?
hey , rico , what become of that pal of yours , that dancer guy , joe massara?
he didn't come .
he ain't been around in a long time .
he didn't quit on you , did he , rico?
bad business to quit on me , sam .
one guy tried that on me once .
now , you mind your own business and let me tend to my own .
what does that bull want in here?
i'll show him where he gets off .
careful , rico .
who invited you here?
you're getting up in the world , aren't you , rico?
the downstairs is open to anybody , even cops .
but the upstairs is private .
thanks , but i like to keep my eye on you , rico .
you see , i'm your friend .
i like to see a young fellow getting up in the world ... ... that's all .
so long .
hurry back .
i will .
oh , say ...
somebody threw a brick through meyer blum's window last night .
do you happen to know anything about a diamond and platinum watch ... ... that was stolen , do you?
if you hear anything about it , let me know , won't you?
banquet , eh?
rico got far ... ... too far .
so now , he's got to stop .
i'm saying he's got to stop !
oh , arnie , are you fellas going to start another scrap?
what's the use of my paying heavy dues for protection if there's no peace?
don't worry .
there'll be peace soon enough .
i'm saying he's got to stop , so he's gonna stop .
he's been cutting in on my territory ... ... and that's all wet with me .
look .
i'm sitting here , see?
i'm sitting here quiet ... ... smoking a cigarette , see?
but a couple of my boys ain't sitting here .
they're out looking for rico , and they got their gats with them too .
catch on?
and when they find him , it won't be no banquet that rico gets .
it will be a wake !
arnie , you know best .
i've never met rico .
phelps , 2284 .
hello , otero .
this is joe massara .
i just found out something .
this is hot .
tell rico to look out .
little arnie's gang is out to put one in him .
what's the matter?
where is rico?
you got me .
he ain't showed up yet .
come on , quick !
we got to find him !
i want 10 of these .
gee , you taking all these papers , mr. rico?
why , sure .
ain't i got my picture in them?
here .
thanks !
come again !
that's all right .
fine shots you are !
oh , no !
so somebody finally put one in you .
yeah , but they just grazed me .
the old man will be glad to hear it .
he takes such an interest in you .
tell him the cops couldn't get me no other way , so they hired gunmen .
if i wasn't on the force , i'd have done the job cheap .
did you ever think how you'd look with a lily in your hand?
no , i never did .
i've been in this game many years , and i put the cuffs on a lot of mugs .
someday , you and i are gonna take a ride , rico ... ... and when we do , i'll have the cuffs on you too .
no buzzard like you will ever put any cuffs on rico .

i don't know what this is all about , but it's a private row .
you guys better beat it .
ain't nobody gonna leave this room .
you guys are invited to this private party .
suppose we don't want to stay?
i wouldn't stop you for the world .
only these boys of mine have itching fingers .
sit down , gents .
arnie ... ... you ought to have better sense than to hire a couple of outside yaps ... ... especially bad shots .
come on .
what is it?
let's have it !
arnie ... ... you're through .
you hire these mugs , they miss .
now you're through .
if you ain't out of town by tomorrow morning ... ... you won't ever leave it except in a pine box .
i'm taking over this territory .
from now on , it's mine .
you're growing , rico .
so this is what you've been after all the time?
i seen it in your eyes the first time i met you .
you're no good , rico .
if you think you can muscle in like you did on sam vettori , you're off your nut !
i suppose you forgot all about pete montana , huh?
how's diamond pete going to stop me?
he may be your boss , but he ain't mine .
sam didn't feel that way about him .
sam knew who gave orders .
sam was too soft .
diamond pete could scare him , but i ain't no sam .
sam is through .
now you're through too .
nice stickpin you got there , arnie .
nothing phony about my jewelry .
arnie ... ... you better quit this racket .
you can dish it out , but you got so that you can't take it no more .
you'd better take your hats and beat it .
the first thing you know , you'll be arrested for firing a rod in the city limits .
well ... ... i guess that's about all .
pleasant trip , gents .
come on , boys .
oh , thanks , boys , for the artillery .
well , boys .
what do you think of it?
you're in the wrong job .
it's perfect .
that means you have a new partner .
little caesar .
everybody'll laugh at scabby's story .
gee , boss .
you gave arnie an awful walloping .
rico ...
now you're famous .
you see , otero .
there ain't no use in being scared of any of these big guys .
the bigger they come , the harder they fall .
yeah .
i ain't doing so bad in this business so far .
well , now .
you look great , boss .
yeah , but it feels terrible .
you're getting up in the world , rico .
none of us ever been invited up to eat at the big boy's dump .
and nobody ever crashed the gate except pete montana .
see what i mean?
now , you don't want the big boy to think you ain't got no class .
they rig you up better than this in the stir .
if you think i'm going out in this , you're crazy !
you look fine , boss .
go on .
take a peek at yourself .
oh , i don't know .
all i need is a napkin over my arm .
now , don't you look fine?
yeah .
i guess maybe i don't look so bad after all .
oh , hello .
hello , big boy .
hello , rico .
oh , yeah .
yeah .
thanks .
thanks very much .
well , you're rather lit up tonight , aren't you?
yeah .
i thought i better put on a monkey suit .
that's right .
you may as well learn now .
yeah .
well ...
some joint you got here .
it'll do .
i bet all this trick furniture set you back plenty , huh?
well , they don't exactly give it away with cigar coupons .
well , i'll tell the world .
boy , it sure look ...
oh , look at that .
do you like it?
oh , i think it's elegant .
that cost me $ 15, 000 .
fifteen thou ...
boy , them gold frames sure cost plenty of dough .
well , will you have a cocktail or a dash of brandy?
oh , no , thanks .
i never touch the stuff .
no?
cigar , then?
oh , yeah .
i'll have one of those .
thanks .
thanks very much .
sit down , rico .
yeah .
thanks .
now , listen , rico .
i'm gonna talk to you , but you're not gonna hear a word i say , see?
this is inside dope , and if it gets out , it'll be just too bad for somebody .
you know me .
all right .
get this .
pete montana's through .
yeah?
well .
and i thought he was such a big guy .
he's through .
suppose i were to tell you that from now on ... ... you were pete montana .
that you were to take over his territory in addition to your own .
would you shake on it?
would i?
would i?
all right .
it's set .
i'm doing a lot for you , rico , but when i get you planted ... ... i'll expect plenty of service .
well , you'll sure get it .
permit me , then , to drink to the new boss of the north side .
thank you .
otero , what did i tell you , huh?
i knew it was coming .
i knew he had his eyes on me all the time .
and let me tell you something , otero .
it's not only pete montana that's through , but the big boy himself .
he ain't what he used to be .
pretty soon , he won't be able to take it , and then ... ... watch me .
sure , boss .
pretty soon , you'll be running the whole town .
otero , you said a mouthful .
there's a guy by the name of massara out there .
he wants to see you , sir .
i'll see him in a minute .
yes , sir .
what's joe want here?
he hasn't been near any of us for months .
i sent for him .
i heard somebody in detroit got to flaherty and told him to start working ... ... on a dancer at the bronze peacock if he wanted to find out who shot mcclure .
gee , boss , you're wise to everything before it happens .
yeah , i don't miss much .
i'll find out if flaherty's been working on joe after i have a little talk with him .
gee , rico , what a palace .
oh , hello , joe .
yeah , it'll do .
but what do you expect?
ain't i got 20 grand tied up in it?
hello , otero .
how are you , baby?
first rate .
sit down , joe .
sure i'm good enough to sit in such a swell chair?
come on , now .
cut the comedy .
sit down .
screw , otero .
i want to talk with joe private .
sure .
see you later , joe .
cigar , joe?
no , thanks .
well , will you have a cocktail or a dash of brandy?
no .
well , it surprise you to hear from me?
kind of .
i thought it would be kind of nice to have a little talk together ... ... like old times .
certainly is nice to see you , rico .
especially like this .
you're looking good .
you're looking good too , joe .
living easy , kind of , huh?
not that easy .
dancing's no cinch .
yeah , but you ain't complaining .
no .
no , i ain't complaining .
that's good .
yeah .
dancing's all right for a sideline .
it gives you a swell front .
but it ain't my idea of a man's game .
what's the difference , rico?
as long as i ain't kicking , why should you kick?
who's kicking?
only why should a young guy like you be wasting his time?
and i kind of took pride in you , joe ... ... brought you into the gang , pushed you ahead .
but now you're getting to be a sissy .
we got to go into that again?
can't you just forget about me?
i don't want to forget , joe .
you're my pal .
we started off together , didn't we?
we've got to keep going along together .
who else do i got to give a hang about?
i need you , joe .
i've got the biggest chance of my life .
the big boy just handed me the whole north side ... ... but it's too much for one man to handle alone .
i need somebody .
a guy like you , somebody i can trust .
can't be me , rico .
i've quit .
you didn't quit .
nobody ever quit me .
you're still in my gang , you got that?
i don't care how many fancy skirts you've got hanging on to you .
that jane's made a softy out of you .
you lay off olga .
i ain't laying off .
i'm after her !
one of us has to lose , and it won't be me .
there's ways of stopping that dame .
you're crazy .
leave her out of this !
she's through , out of the way .
you're lying .
you wouldn't dare !
i wouldn't?
i'll show you !
rico , listen .
we're in love with one another .
don't that mean nothing?
nothing .
less than nothing .
love .
soft stuff !
when she's got you , you ain't no good for anything .
we ain't out of this yet ... ... and we don't want no softies spilling things !
i won't spill anything , if you're scared of that .
you think i want my neck stretched?
well , you know too much .
i ain't gonna take any chances .
you're hanging around with me , see?
no , i'm not .
all right .
you go back to that dame ... ... and it's suicide .
suicide for both of you .
just stick here .
hello?
oh , hello , big boy .
no .
no , i don't want that guy .
i don't trust him .
yeah .
i got a kid by the name of joe massara who'll help me .
yeah .
all right , goodbye , big boy .
oh , joe ...
joe .
olga .
we've gotta go .
hurry !
joe , what's the matter?
didn't you hear what i said?
hurry !
hurry !
yes , joe .
oh , you're ill .
i'm all right .
rico .
what did he do to you?
oh , didn't i know it?
he , rico ...
he said you and me gotta quit .
he'd kill you unless i stuck with him .
i ran away .
we've got to get out of here .
anywhere .
as long as we get away !
no .
no?
you're not coming?
no .
that's not the way .
but , olga , you don't know that guy !
olga , you've got to !
please !
no .
sit down , joe .
we've got to think .
i don't want to think or sit down .
you're coming .
don't you see?
it would be no use !
where?
where would we go?
where would we run to?
there's no place he wouldn't find us .
there's only one thing for us to do .
flaherty .
you're crazy .
you think that would save us?
flaherty?
that's worse than suicide .
i won't do it .
i can't .
well , i can do it .
that gang must go .
rico must go .
i want my happiness , joe .
i want you .
we'll never have peace till rico's gone .
i'm going to do it .
olga , don't !
please !
stay here !
olga , open this door !
olga , open this door !
hurry !
park , 1000 .
olga .
don't call flaherty .
please , open this door , quickly !
rico will kill us both !
headquarters , i want sergeant flaherty .
sergeant flaherty , this is olga stassoff .
i've got joe massara with me .
in my apartment .
17 edsel drive .
yes .
yes , he wants to talk to you .
hurry , hurry !
come on , boys , we're going to a party .
who's giving the party?
joe massara .
formal or informal?
i don't know , but we'll find out when we get there .
you shouldn't have done it .
you shouldn't have .
there was no other way .
no other right way .
it's the rope for me .
no , it isn't .
not if you turn state's evidence .
we'll make them promise everything will be okay .
wait , olga !
joe !
there he is , the dirty double crosser .
give it to him , rico !
no .
shoot .
shoot , rico .
get it over with .
come on , otero !
let's go !
you're getting soft too .
what's the matter with you?
come on !
joe .
who was it?
otero and rico .
through the window !
go on , boys .
go and get him !
are you ready to talk now , joe?
well , i'll talk .
it was rico's gang that held up the bronze peacock .
it was rico who shot mcclure .
that dirty , low , sneaking ...
well , joe will tell you .
ask him .
he knows it was rico .
is that right , joe?
was it rico?
where's your phone?
in there .
oh , joe .
here , let me help you .
park , 1000 .
hello , dan , this is flaherty .
round up that palermo gang .
i got enough on them to use a mile of rope .
shoot the cars right out , and above all , get rico .
we've gotta watch our step .
the cops are sure to be cruising around .
you should have plugged joe .
and the dame .
if they ain't squealed about mcclure yet , they'll do it now .
from now on , we're hot .
yeah .
this is what i get for liking a guy too much .
come on .
halt !
halt !
go on , rico .
i'm done for .
go on , rico .
sam !
sam !
joe massara !
they nabbed him over the mcclure business , and he squawked .
rico tried to get him .
now they're after him .
they got otero .
otero?
sam , don't you get me?
what are you sitting there for?
what else can i do?
i can't run now .
they'd get me anyhow .
you're out of your head .
come on , get up .
let's beat it !
it's no use .
put them up !
don't move !
hand over your guns .
all right .
take them down to the car .
you'd better give up , sam .
drop that gun before we start shooting .
come on in .
get on your feet and put your hands up .
put the cuffs on him .
you ain't got nothing on me .
nothing but the bracelets .
and we haven't got a thing on rico , either .
he's next .
there's nobody in there .
no?
well , listen , ma .
if you see rico , you'd better let us know , quick .
well ... ... you got yourself in a nice fix .
yeah .
the cops were just here .
they got otero .
ma , i'm gonna stay here a day or two , then i want a car .
gonna cost you big , because i'm taking big chances .
i got 10 grand planted here .
help yourself .
when you're ready to start , i'll give you $ 150 .
you'll give me?
whose money is this?
who do you think you're talking to?
i need plenty .
my money is hidden in the apartment .
i can't get to it .
i'll give you $ 150 .
take it or leave it .
why , you dirty , thieving old hag , i'll ...
no , you won't .
because i'm the only one knows where the money's hid .
kill me , and you won't get a cent .
i'll give you $ 150 ... ... if you'll be a good boy .
he was mean , sam vettori was .
so now he's got what was coming to him .
what does it say in the paper?
former gang chief faints on scaffold .
after a futile battle in the courts ... ... sam vettori , former gang leader ... ... today presented a pitiful figure ... ... as the hangman's noose was placed around his neck .
listen .
little caesar has never been found .
according to the statement of lieutenant thomas flaherty of the homicide squad ... ... little caesar , the once swaggering braggart of the underworld ... ... wilted in the face of real danger and showed the world his cowardice .
flaherty stated further that little caesar has contradicted his oft repeated boast ... ... that he could dish it out and take it too .
yeah .
when a real crisis arose ... ... rico couldn't take it .
'meteoric as was rico's rise from the gutter ... ... it was inevitable that he should return there . '
well , just the same , he was the real leader of that gang .
don't you believe it .
rico didn't have the nerve , and he didn't have the brains .
he was yellow , just like flaherty said .
here !
that's what rico ...
give me that paper !
hey , watch it !
what's the matter with him?
must be crazy .
i'll show them where they get off .
trying to put that kind of stuff about me in the papers , huh?
i'll show them ...
hello?
hello?
i want park , 1000 .
yeah .
yeah , i can't take it no more , huh?
i'll tell that guy where to ...
hello?
park , 1000?
get me flaherty , and get him quick .
sure .
just a minute .
tom .
oh , tom .
i may be screwy , but this sounds like rico .
yeah?
flaherty speaking .
yeah , this is rico speaking !
rico !
r l c o , rico !
little caesar , that's who !
you're a big guy , ain't you?
shooting your mouth off in the papers .
so i ran out when it got hot , huh?
i can't take it no more?
well , listen , you crummy , flatfooted copper ... ... i'll show you whether i lost my nerve .
thanks , rico , old boy .
the same to you and many of them .
come on , tell me some more .
the sound of your voice does my heart good .
trace that call .
find out where he's phoning from , quick .
say , why didn't you come to sam's neck stretching party , rico?
it was a big success .
funny guy , ain't you , flaherty?
well , you ain't got much longer to laugh .
i'm coming , and i'm gonna put one in your dirty hide ... ... for every lying crack that you made about me , see?
i'll show you who's gonna finish up in the gutter .
we've missed you , rico .
the town has been nice and quiet .
i'm putting on weight .
river , 6547 .
it's a flophouse down at 4th and commercial .
all right .
all right , big mouth .
get your hat and start running , see , because you're all through .
call the papers and tell them that , you rotten , dirty , lying copper !
i knew we'd hear from that guy if i kept giving it to him in the papers .
the conceit of that guy !
they'll have to build a special noose to get that swelled head of his through .
well , wish me luck .
there he is .
that's rico , all right .
pull in there .
you'd better give up , rico .
you haven't got a chance .
you'll have to come and get me .
you'd better be a nice boy , rico , and come out .
you heard me !
if you want me , come and get me !
i'll be with you in a minute .
give me that chopper .
this is your last chance , rico .
are you coming out , or do you want to be carried out?
well , rico , it looks like you and i are going to take that little ride together .
no ...
no , we ain't .
i told you a little buzzard like you will never put any cuffs on me .
you should have come out when i told you to , rico .
mother of mercy .
is this the end of rico?
