refrigerator .
i want to show you something , mr. beck , please .
does that iook iike a refrigerator to you?
looks more iike heil .
where you see heil , i see a speilbinding sense of purpose .
i see the value of keeping your eye on the bail .
when a bride slips the ring on her finger ... ... when a businessman lays his hands on a rolex ... ... when a rapper gets a shiny new tooth , this is that cost , mr. beck .
my horror for their beauty .
my heii for their iittle slice of heaven .
somebody's gotta keep his eye on the ball .
that somebody is me , mr. beck .
i am down here every day keeping my eye on the ball .
that's just a simple fact of life .
and if you're bold enough to face that cold , hard fact ... ... you can make a iot of money .
what do you want with the kid?
i've come to take him home .
that'ii cost you $ 1 0, 000 .

and then we begin our iong journey back to los angeles .
there'ii be no blood , no broken bones ... ... and no problems .

reaily?
are you sure?
i mean , big boy , there's always an option c.
so angry !
shut up .
shut up !
like i said , there is no option c.
let me introduce you to option c.
mr. beck ...

an unexpected twist , you might say .
can i have a beer , please?
mr. hatcher , i was just gonna come find you when this
the kid stays .
i paid you .
weil , fortunately ... ... i had my fingers crossed the whole time .
apparently , young mr. walker ... ... may have stumbled onto a trinket of value .
and as he's iocated it in my jungle ... ... i'm gonna need him to iead me to it .
okay , so iet's go , dickhead .
don't caii me a dickhead , you dickhead .
did you find it or not , asshole?

... i'm feeling pretty healthy .
oh , yeah?
walk .
don't make waves .
you're gonna kiii us ail , mr. beck?
i tried to be reasonable .

the hieroglyphic code ... ... said the great chief of the maraj people put the gato to sleep ...

they say it's dangerous .
what else do they say?
once restored to its rightfui owners , the rivers wiii be iaden with fish .
and the trees wiii grow tail , bringing shade for hammocks ... ... so its people may rest their backs .
you think bringing this gato wiii do aii that?
no , mr. beck .
but i expect the money seiling it brings wiii do just that .
we can buy seed , irrigate .
farm our own iands .
free ourselves from hatcher's mine .
when that statue hits the black market , it'ii vanish forever .
it's a iittle iate for morals .
especiaily after you were going to do the same thing .
and 1 0 percent of that is going to pay for your freedom ... ... so i'd be a iittle more gratefui if i were you .
what if i told you i was gonna give it to a museum ... ... so the whole world could appreciate it?
you can teii me anything you want , travis , but i know you .
what are you going to do after you bring him home?
i'm gonna open a restaurant .

i'm sorry ... ... but money has a way of changing people .
you did find it , travis .
just iike you said .
no one can take that away from you .
and i wiii send you the money ... ... buy your freedom .
i meant that .
you kept your word , and i admire that ... ... so i'ii keep mine .

he got what he was after .
what do you mean?
he caught up with poor mariana in the jungle .
he relieved her of her artifact .

i know you're gonna run on me .
might not be tonight or tomorrow .
but i wiii find you , and i wiii take you back .
are we clear?
yeah .
we'ii both probably be dead in about an hour .
so iet's cancei christmas .
your plan of attack was a bit naive .
man , if i was only 1 0 minutes younger , huh?
i suppose now we have a conversation where you enlighten me .
mr. hatcher .
how many more of you are out there?
enlighten me .
where are the rest of your compadres?
enlighten me !
mr. hatcher .
i don't get why you people are so hostile .
i've been good to you .
i built you a town .
why are we fighting?
mr. hatcher .
what?
we've iost contact with outpost 1 .
there's nobody answering .
mr. hatcher , are you out there?
what can i do for you , mr. beck?
i have no desire to fight with you or your men .
for that reason , you have two options .
option a , you leave the gato and the girl ... ... and you walk out of town , no questions asked .
what's option b?
option b ... ... i make you .
wrong choice .
lock down the town .
still no visual contact .
team two is checking the perimeter right now .
he ... ... that heard the sound of thy holy trumpet ... ... and took not warning ... ... he hath clearly wandered too far ... ... from the word of god .
and cornelius bernard hatcher ... ... your heir has come .
let's get it on , big boy !
it's time to get back on the path .
that's a iot of cows .
hi .

you can walk away right now .
option a doesn't work for me .
before i came here , what did you people have?

you barefoot indians didn't have pockets ... ... before hatcher came along .
i gave you a iife !
i'm the heart in the darkness .
face it ... ... you can't run this thing without me .
i am pumping the blood of the modern world ... ... into your backward veins ... ... you stinking ... ... ingrate ... ... oompa loompa ... ... morons !
