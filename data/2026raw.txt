you punk rockers are so ugly .
i'm sick of you all !
i try to always look my fans in the eye .
to not forget about them .
you have to stay humble , even if you know ... ... you're being worshipped by a lot of people .
i try to keep that in mind when it gets to be too much .
who's eating with us?
what's he doing here?
you invite someone who hit your sister?
he cut my hair off .
that was two years ago .
and he regrets it .
he never told me that .
no , well ... he's shy .
shy?
he's nice when he's not drinking .
he's not nice , he's a pig .
i'm pregnant .
by him?
why don't you say it out loud?
he doesn't know yet .
i can tell him , if you like .
abra , you'll get beat up if you look like that .
was he the only one who would fuck you?
stop acting like a rock star , you'll never be one .
get yourself a damned boyfriend .
just a tip .
micke !
you got a cord?
hi .
micke !
did you have a cord?
there are maybe ten people there .
no point in waiting for more .
there's plenty of people outside .
yeah , i know .
they only come in when there's 50's style rock 'n roll .
thank god i moved out of here .
i'm visiting .
do you play with the band?
oh , no way .
that's not my kind of music .
i know the roadie .

who are those guys?
they heard my demo .

my single is out by christmas .
you'll be back when your money runs out .
you're so immature !
get yourself a damned boyfriend .
so you listened to it?
what did you think?
you can't polish a turd .
that's pretty much what i thought .
hi .
i am so out of shape .
is he your boyfriend?
him?
no , we're fuck buddies .
fuck buddies?
that's right .
what's the best concert you've been to?
oh , right ...
i don't know which one to pick .
ebba grn two years ago , at the park stage back home .
they really rocked .
what about you?
the clash at isstadion or iggy at draken .
it's kind of hard to choose .
but i prefer small gigs at errol's .
errol's?
you've been there , right?
of course , i thought you said ...
i've been there lots of times .
stop , micke .
i need to take a leak .
first record?
wait ...
mine was elo's new world record .

it's so great !
no , they suck .
i have it on tape , let's listen .
they suck so bad .

i prefer listening .
it's been so long since i heard it .

thanks .

excuse me , do you know where errol's is?
the age limit is 20 .
yeah .
i am 20 .
have you got id?
no , but i have stuff for the band .
what band?
lolita pop .
they'll be here next week .
hey .
no way were they 20 .
go home and go to bed .
hi , it's abra .
we met at ...
i'm sorry .
i didn't mean to wake you .
i've got a slight problem .
well , a big problem .
i've lost my keys .
i thought i'd ask if i could ...
i only had mulled wine .
that's alright .
i was at errol's until they closed
and when i was getting my bag from coat check ...
... my stuff was gone .
i've never seen coat check there .
it's not really coat check , but ...
what?
never mind .
what's the song about?
i meant for it to be a bit like ...
like a kick in the groin of the establishment .
yeah , i can tell .
can i stay here a while?
i keep fighting with my sister .
sure , you can take the mattress ...
fuck !
you're heating mulled wine in the oven?
yeah , the hot plates are busted .
they're gonna tear this place down .
there's not even a laundry room .
screw it .
we're ranked as low as you can get .
below even dogs .
and i only got half of my accommodation allowance .
pigs .
where the hell is sweden headed?
you have to wonder .
do you sort by name or style?
preparty , party , after party and weekdays .
hello , what happened here?
i had to buy it .
we were parodying him in school .
i don't listen to lundell .
and it just came with an autograph?
bye , uffe !
if you come back , i'll call the exterminators .
i have to go pee .
hey !
should we start a band?
of course we should .
when do we start?
but we really have to go for it .
of course .
how about a single by christmas?
that sounds awesome .
and no boyfriends .
hell no !
wait ... what did you just say?
the band always breaks up if someone has a boyfriend .
yeah .
so , for how long?
until the single is out .
no , i'll just get depressed .
that's a good thing .
there are no good songwriters who aren't super depressed .
all the time .
your mind is warped , but okay .
okay .
glrl band seeks drummer punk , garage , no synths
hi , do you have the new herreys album?
she played the bass for gothenburg's first girl punk band , svarta ada .
they were great .
how good were they?
don't know .
they never released anything .
but they were great .
let's ask her to play with us .
no !
she's too big for us .
she's a legend .
that was a long smoke break .
no matter , we'll deduct it from your paycheck .
try the brand glenn , they're shorter .
line up those sausages .
i think of him when i screw piffen .
i tried getting him at the christmas party .
he didn't laugh at a single joke of mine .
no sense of humor .
have you got a light?
yeah .
how come you're not in this ugly outfit?
i just refuse to wear them .
i won't take any shit .
same here .
i don't take shit either .
the last time i took shit was at my last job .
and i just told myself that i wasn't going to take any shit .
and then i stopped .
okay .
what are you listening to?
my own music .
it'll be out as a single before christmas .
that's you singing , right?
you've got a good voice .
thanks .
you should write a song about the serfs here at the sausage ...
are you aware you've smoked away half the working day now?
to make up for it , do my laundry .
iron it and fold it .
if you have a sewing machine , fix the yellow pants .
if you don't have a sewing machine , get one .
got it?
good .
i'm not the kind of person who likes to be hurtful .
but i have to be honest .
i think it's kind of lame .
the lyrics are lame , and it's slow .
you have to mean what you write .
you have to be honest when making music .
i know i am .
we're supposed to sound like pissed off rabid dogs .
i can't believe i wrote that .
but i wrote it .
i mean the lyrics .
have you heard that radio show " bommen "?
let's send them our demo .
yeah .
millan .
you can't call here now .
we're waiting for answers to our ad .
should we add drums to it?
they're piffen's .
i can't play .
i don't believe you .
that's his thing .
i'm ...
millan .
i told you you can't call right now !
we're waiting for drummers and bass players to call .
bye !
is my sister there?
hi , it's me .
yeah , i have an apartment now .
the record company got it for me .
they really believe in me .
i'll have a single out by christmas .
i have a girl playing guitar with me , millan .
we have some gigs , too .
we're getting a following .
they sing along and know the lyrics .
if no one calls , we have to let guys in the band .
and we'll be their backup singers within a week .
check it out .
lundell?
no way .
did you see that?
he waved at me .
that's awesome .
not interested in guys , huh?
of course i am .
have you ever ...?
ever what?
you know .
have you ever fucked?
no , i haven't .
not even once?
not even a little bit?
there's nobody to do it with where i'm from .
wait !
what about petting?
but you have made out , right?
i have to make a call .
but you've kissed , right?
millan , please .

and have a bit of sex with me?
wait , wait !
hi !
hello .
check this out .
this is cool .
kind of like iggy .
here's the sleeve picture .
what should we call the band?
something weird .
like " give the kid a trailer " or " puking helicopter " .
it's too bad that " tattooed cop cocks " is taken .
" never mind the ass juice "?
or " god save the king " .
like it?
we're god save the king !
show us your boobies !
show us your boobies !
you little shit !
you'd better apologize !
let's change our style .
why?
even the ladies at work have punk hairdos .
it's not cool anymore .
abra , we can't change just because some 1 3 year old doesn't like us .
we have to fight for this .
what about those who do like us?
take this , hold it out .
cigarettes !
cigarettes !
come on , will you?
thanks .
could you write your band name on my back?
our single is out by christmas .
really?
thank you .
strindberg s playing " bombparty " .
time for the demo of the week , from gothenburg .
the band is called god save the king .
they are millan olsson ...
that's me .
and i can't read the other name .
can't he read?
i wrote it real nice .
here's " fa fa fabriken " .
i have to call my sister .
what are they doing outside , instead of listening to the radio?
come on !
hurry !
never mind , he's over 30 .
they're listening to it here .
and they have no clue they're my neighbors .
that was the demo of the week with god save the king .
wait !
thank you , roskilde !
see you again next year !
thank you , you've been a great audience !
i'll be right there !
relax , damn it !
you can't come in .
but you look so nice .
alright , come on in .
abra?
piffen needs to talk for a bit .
he just broke up with his girlfriend , so it's kind of private .
do you mind sitting in the kitchen?
the kitchen?
it's really sensitive .
he needs someone to talk to .
can't you guys sit in the kitchen?
please?
everything okay?
yeah .
i'm just taking my clothes .
nothing happened , you know .
can't you go to the movies?
oh , fun .
hi .
did you rent the room , or could i ...?
here you go .
it's much too big .
that's ronny , philosophy student , when he can get around to it .
ronny .
hey , ronny !
wake up .
he's got the clap .
i see .
what a hassle .
i was thinking 500 .
a third of the rent , basically .
it's a large , airy closet .
and the bed is pretty much unused .
do you want to hear the song?
what song?
you said i should write a song about the sausage factory .
who knows , it might be the single b side .
it's good .
so , what do you think of lundell?
i guess he's done some good stuff .
some?
he's a damned genius .
thinking about it , some of his stuff is really , really good .
almost gives you goose bumps .
exactly .
this is where i live .
the world's loneliest job .
lundell wrote his novel " jack " on the same machine .
what , that one?
no , the same model .
are you writing a book?
a novel .
i see .
is it difficult?
no .
it pours out of my fingers onto the keys .
just like that .
it can't be controlled .
i just can't find a name for the protagonist's girlfriend .
abra is a pretty good name .
can i use that?
sure .
i made it .
hi .
check it out , i got my driver's license !
man , you're great .
you did it .
i'm so damned happy .
first try?
yeah !
abra is here for the room .
hi , i'm karin .
are you going to rent it?
i haven't decided yet .
i'm checking out some different places .
we'll see .
i'll call you , if ...
okay .
forget it .
they can't be there and in our top ten for the third week .
people just love crap .
what's the point of making music if that's 1?
anyone could write this .
let's do that , take the money ...
... and then release something good .
you can't be serious .
like i'd touch a synthesizer .
damn right wing piano .
millan .
yes , that's me .
okay .
yeah , i know where that is .
we'll be there as soon as we can .
bye .
well , tell me .
tell me !
just a girl answering the ad .
come on .
that's enough , thank you .
that's a synthesizer .
the ad said " no synthesizers " .
i have my own pa .
it works great , so we can use that .
i figured we'd experiment and come up with something new .
you could try ... ... gospel punk .
interesting .
or this .
synthesizer punk .
you're very accomplished .
and i make my own stage outfits .
how about it?
no thanks .
we're punk .
great .
great?
yeah , that's really great .
what's your name?
gloria?
i'll call you .
millan !
i thought we liked the same music .
she's got a pa !
what's the point if the music sucks?
no synthesizers in our band .
you're so narrow minded .
i'm honest .
that's what punk is .
don't you get it?
punk will be over before we've started .
i don't give a fuck .
i'm punk , and i will be forever .
how punk is it that piffen decides if you can drum or not?
give me the key .
you've been brainwashed by the right .
and the record contract?
screw that .
where am i supposed to live?
millan !
could i sleep here?
just until millan calms down?
i don't think so , because my parents are getting divorced .
hi .
alright , then ...
come on , those are your sausages .
what are you up to?
what's going on?
haven't i told you about lining them up?
are you deaf , or just stupid?
maybe you're retarded .
what the hell have i done to you?
i'm not taking more shit from you !
who wants a crappy job like this?
settle down , abra .
you're the honest one , but you never mention you hate him too .
i'm an adult .
i don't need some hitler watching over me .
please sign there .
well , maybe not hitler ...
maybe mussolini?
if i stained your clothes , i can buy new ones .
i don't think we share tastes .
what if i apologize?
i'm not planning to throw sausages at you again .
i wouldn't do that .
sign it .
please?
wait !
gothenburg
i have to come with you .
i know you're there , i can see your feet .
let's be friends again .
do it now .
i'm too nervous .
she's huge .
she gets in everywhere .
she could sink us , abra .
hi .
hey there .
do you still play the bass?
what do you mean?
didn't you play with svarta ada?
yeah .
did you hear us?
hell yeah .
you were great .
our band needs a bass player .
are you available?
was that your song on the radio?
it was pretty good .
how'd you know it was us?
it's written on your back .
oh , right .
well?
i don't really have time .
i could help you get started .
do you have a drummer?
no .
yes , we have .
that's me .
well , there you go .
line up .
the first picture is important .
it always becomes a collector's item .
alright , look pissed off .
why?
we're not a party band .
you can still be happy .
nine out of ten good singles have pissed off sleeves .
you want to go to errol's?
i'll get you in .
one more time , one more time !
we'll be up there one day .
i feel sorry for them .
who?
the roadies , slaving away .
no one likes them .
i have a present for you .
abra?
it's my way of thanking you for letting me join the band .
thanks .
does it fit you?
abra !
you look great !
come out and let me see you .
incredible , abra .
you look great !
turn around .
it looks great .
i was trying for punk when i made it .
it's really nice .
aren't you wearing it right away?
maybe tomorrow .
i have my clothes .
i can take them in my bag .
you can wear it now .
i really don't think so .
you could at least wear the jacket .
i had to .
i'll make some for you , too .
do you want a drink?
can't afford it .
i'm out of work .
the record store needs people .
really?
i love records .
bar johnny wants you in his office .
why?
why?
few get to go there .
he knows music industry people .
go .
hi .
sit down .
did you book tacky tom?
yeah .
they were really good .
we have a band that ...
don't talk so much .
you're cuter when you're quiet .
people talk so much these days .
i don't think so .
come on ...
i really don't think so .
come on .
what were you expecting?
how do you think i got gigs here?
i know he's disgusting .
did he get pissed off?
is he still in there?
does isa like me , you think?
don't know .
have you seen millan?
no .
what do you think millan thinks of me?
she loves you .
so does isa , and i do too .
if you don't like the jacket , i can make some alterations .
millan?
millan?
room for rent cheap , central locatlon
i'm sorry , i was getting something .
do you want tea?
we were just making some .
no , i just had some .
i don't drink tea .
good .
i don't have any .
bye .
bye .
how did it go with dickan?
it didn't work out .
doesn't he have a girlfriend?
does he?
the blond one he was with .
that's his sister karin .
i think this is for the best .
i don't want him anyway .
i really don't mind .
i think it's good we're not a couple .
were you ever a couple?
no .
i'd be sad if that was the case .
now i'm happy .
that's nice .
yes , it's really nice .
where are my cigarettes?
did you tidy up in here?
now i can't find a thing .
you can t just tidy up without asking .
what if i came to your house and tidied up?
would you like that?
seriously , you can't stay here for the rest of your life .
get a life .
hi .
i've made up my mind .
excuse me .
ronny fell asleep over hegel .
you want some wine?
it's only ten past two .
we can wait until quarter past .
how's the single coming?
have you recorded it yet?
we haven't really decided on the song .
and i have writer's block right now .
i know the feeling .
how old are you?
twenty two .
just wait until you're twenty five .
that's when the demons swoop in .
demons?
i try to capture that in the novel .
i see .
what's it about?
i don't want to talk too much about it , because that makes it go flat .
but it's kind of a novel to define a generation .
is her name still abra?
what?
you wanted my name for the book .
right .
exactly .
a toast to your novel getting up there .
and for my band too .
up there?
up there .
they're going up there .
well , look at it .
i am looking .
hi , it's me .
i've moved in with a guy .
yeah , he's a writer .
he's really in love with me .
is he writing a book about you?
yes .
never mind , forget it .
want to hear a new song?
abra , not in here .
it's just so beautiful .
want to know what i think?
it's kind of lame .
didn't you hate ballads?
no , you did .
no , it was you .
and no boyfriend before the record .
you don't think we're a couple?
you don't get it .
when do i get the rent money?
you're behind .
i'll start adding interest soon .
hey .
i got us a gig that might lead to a tv spot .
bar johnny knows a tv producer whose sister is getting married .
that's huge .
huge?
not really .
the pay sucks , but if it gets us on tv , that could lead to a record deal .
record deal?
does anyone have a car?
it's kind of far away .
i don't even have a license .
i don't have a license it's matter of principle .
i can be a trainee driver in three months .
interesting .
is anyone taking notes?
abra , don't be nice to guys with bad taste in music .
they might as well go elsewhere .
he bought some bowie .
it's pronounced " bauey " .
early bowie is fine , but not " let's dance " .
i'll keep that in mind .
good .
you do know how to get pocket money , right?
i mean how to steal from the till .
but roffe's right there .
he doesn't notice anything , as stoned as he is .
flip this one over , so the customer doesn't see the total
then you punch in 50 instead of 59 , and split the difference for yourself .
i don't think so .
give it a shot .
i've been paid .
do you want some wine?
i have two bottles .
so , it's not supposed to rhyme?
no .
that song was really good .
when can i read your book?
it's hard to say when it'll be done .
it's a process .
a painful process .
it's a bit more complex than just writing a song .
not that writing a song is easy .
i didn't mean that .
does abra fall for anyone in the book?
so , how old are you?
why do you ask?
how old are you?
twenty two .
you're lying .
no , i'm not .
your id says you're nineteen .
did you go through my wallet?
that's low !
abra !
dickan , i was going to rent a video player .
want to chip in?
lend me your car , ronny .
wait , wait , wait !
so , what was the point of this song?
i guess we wanted it to be a boil on the ass of the establishment .
at a wedding?
a boil on the ass?
that's gross .
i think the song's great .
especially the lyric .
and who wrote that?
that would be me .
seriously , here's some advice : drop the punk thing .
it's dead .
record companies want new stuff .
then i'm out .
i have a new song .
and change the name .
god save the king?
how about lola wants to dance?
no?
alright then .
next item : who's going to call abf?
you call them , say that we're a study group of six or so .
and then we get money .
it's for equipment , but we'll just split it .
how does your song sound , gloria?
really great song , gloria .
thank you .
wait a second .
are we some party band now?
i won't have that .
then look for another band .
sorry .
i didn't mean it that way .
right .
it's not like i asked him to pick me up .
maybe he means me .
wait .
i have to give him the key .
i forgot .
is that her boyfriend?
no , she just lives with him .
he's nuts .
he's writing a book about her .
okay ...
you know , i ...
i don't usually go through people's wallets .
i'm sorry .
did you wait here for three hours?
you're not allergic , i hope .
hey there .
i have kind of a weird question .
could you drive us to a gig on saturday?
not a problem .
i probably should leave you alone .
isa !
don't mention it to millan .
don't tell millan anything about us .
that's got to be the tv producer .
hi , i'm stefan bergwall .
toastmaster , brother of the bride .
i'm not in the band .
i'm the driver .
so , who runs the show?
that would be me .
hi .
oh .
i thought i'd booked a regular band .
are you going to look like that?
don't you have stage clothes?
yeah , but we'll change into them later .
i'm not dressing up for some upper class wedding .
he's a tv producer .
yeah , come on .
you can sit in the kitchen until you go on .
the kitchen?
what the fuck?
that's fine thank you .
why are we in the kitchen?
rock bands deserve a dressing room .
look what the staff lent me .
they might not be the right size ...
maybe i can find a sewing machine .
please , no sewing now .
dearest bride and groom , dearest friends .
time for some live music , but first ... what was it?
oh , right !
drinks can be bought in the bar .
we have a bucket there where you can put money for the honeymoon .
and now , time for some live music .
featuring the orchestra molly wants to dance .
come on !
hello .
could you please ...
could you ...?
thanks .
how about playing something we know?
don't you know any hit songs?
no .
house of the rising sun?
no .
sweet home alabama?
sorry .
not house of the rising sun ...
how about johnny b. goode?
we should know that .
good , let's do it .
