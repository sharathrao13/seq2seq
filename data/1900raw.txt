when i was in high school , my mom wanted me to work in one of those burger joints .

i mean , think about it , nick .
how many times could you actually say ,
hi , welcome to burger bastards , how may i help you?
would you like a drink with that?
hey !
did you try our new fajitas?
it wouldn't be long until i just snapped !
then some day , some foolio drives up and asked me to " hold the pickles .
i'd just lunged through that window with a french fry scoop in my hand and i just rammed those fucking pickles right down his throat .
jacki , you just missed my turn !
fuck !
next thing you know , i'm standing in front of some judge with this court ordered attorney pleading the " special orders do fucking upset us " defense .
yeah , great .
listen , flip a bitch at this light , will you?
i'm fucking tired .
but it'd be worth it .
you know why , nick?
you're a fucking idiot , you know that?
because when shit like that happens , it's never about the pickle .
okay , that's good .
animal , that's enough !

my brother beating our stepfather to death in my bed with me still in it .
i wish i'd had a big brother like animal .
i was eight years old
i remember ... watching this movie
i don't remember what it was called , but ...
bobby darin was in it .
and he was playing his guitar in some army hospital .
and i tried so hard to pretend that he was singing to me , and that i was there , so i didn't have to be where i was .
i watched a lot of movies like that .
i just i don't want people to feel sorry for me .
i mean , i feel like a freak .
you're just kids , for christ's sake .
they're the freaks , man .
you know ...
sal , i know it sounds stupid , when you say it out loud you know , or corny , whatever , but it's true , man .
music was the one thing that helped me .
when i play , i feel ...
safe .

i'm a 40 year old woman chasing a teenage dream .
but you know what?
it all comes down this .
these 40 or 50 minutes of playing live a few times a month .
# now i dream on the radio #
# asking , " where's my guy?
did he fuck up? " #
# no one thought we'd see this day #
# when we all thought he dropped away #
# the rich orpoor , right or left #
# black and white died the same death . #
at the end ofthe day , when all is said and done , you got your band , you got your family , and you got your friends . # it's a beautiful planet # and if you're really lucky ...
# it's a wonderful life # ... they're all one and the same . # ... and after the bar bash #
# i'm having a party all by myself #
# i'd invite the world , but everyone's dead #
# shall i comb my hair?
shall i wait on guests? #
# it gets any later , just wait on death ! #
all my life , all i ever wanted to be
was a rock and roll star .
# it's a beautiful planet #
instead , i'm a musician ...
it's a wonderful life ! ... just some chick in a band . # it's a beautiful planet #
and you know what?
it's a wonderful life !
it's fucking cool !
# my life is three chords so let me finish #
