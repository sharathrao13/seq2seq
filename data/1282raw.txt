i'll tell you who i don't want to take credit for ... that d. c. sniper .
i was mad when i found out dude was black .
hold on there , terri .
the d. c. sniper is like the jackie robinson of crime .
what? !
tell them , eddie .
he broke into the white leagues with that crime .
that crime took planning .
not only planning , it took math .
you know , it took math to figure out all them trajectories to shoot from the back of an automobile .
that's white folk shit right there .
with the problems we got , black folks used to could say ,
at least we ain't crazy .
our crimes made sense .

most of these businesses coming in are black owned .
this whole block is gonna get upgrades .
they can tear down all this mess around here .
change is a good thing .
long as they ain't buildin 'liquor stores and titty bars , i'm cool with it .
wait a minute now , calvin .
if they build a titty bar across the street , i ain't never goin 'home .
hey , babe !

y'all see calvin baby boy?
hey , coley .
you know that should have been your baby .
i know .
after calvin and i stopped dating , he started thinkin 'small .
he opted for the happy meal instead of the super size .
no , he opted for less drama .
it's her six foot pocahontas weave .
that's what it is .
she ain't weavin 'it up like most of y'all in here .
y'all just mad 'cause she got a little indian in her family .

you're just my baby .
yes , he is .

jesus wept .
why?
why what?
why did jesus weep?
'cause he was sad .
why was he sad?
'cause they didn't let him eat his biscuit .
now , you know i helped raise you better than that .
raised you like you was my own son .
okay .
i gotta go , miss emma .
when you get back here , you better tell me why jesus wept .
you know what?
he probably was mad
'cause they wouldn't let him put jelly on his biscuit before he left .
i ain't seen you in two days .
and why you look so damn tired?
ricky , just be a man and let me know .
i'm being a man .
if you got somebody else , then just say it .
you don't need to be slippin 'and slidin 'and hidin '.
nobody hidin '.
this ain't no subterfuge .
i just been busy .
doin 'what?
'cause you sure ain't doin 'me .
who you doin '?
and what the hell is a subter fudge?
listen , you know how it is , all right?
when we together , we together .
and when we not , we not .
that ricky , he's the man .
please .
he's a clown .
be like mike , not like rick .
if i was like mike , would you like me?
brad pitt .
mel gibson .
bill clinton .
bill clinton?
he's a freak , and i likes me a freaky man .
if i had to choose me a white boy to sleep with ,
i'd have to say mini me .
mini me?
use your head .
what?

i'll take me one of those .
all i'm saying is we need to keep our eye on trent lott .
we need to know where his ass is at all times .
he racist !
he's the poster child for stupid white men .
i don't know about that .
dan quayle couldn't spell " potato .
you know what?
you right about that , checkers .
you know what?
you can be a stupid white man and get elected president .
twice !
all i'm saying is if you're gonna have oral relations with an ugly , fat white girl with low self esteem , lock the door .
lock the door !
click .
handle your business .
there it is .
calvin , come look .
they're gonna lock your ass up for talkin 'like that .
when did they put that up?
guess it ain't no titty bar .
hold up .
i can't believe this .
quentin !
hey , calvin .
you like our sign?
not too flashy , i hope .
i don't want it to fight the funk of the neighborhood .
i thought this was a club .
what is nappy cutz?
you never heard of us?
it's a franchise , the black man's answer to supercuts .
got ten locations nationwide .
this'll be the first one in chicago .
ten chairs with every amenity the african american male desires .
on my block?
it's just an alternative .
you the man .
your shop is legendary .
only business on the block to survive the riots of '68 .
we can't compete with you .
i gotta go .
listen , when 24/ 7 opens , i'd love to buy you a latte .
i can buy my own damn latte .
i know what this is .
you're tryin 'to compete with us .
it's not a competition .
it's a rout .
your business will be closed in six months , seven at the most .
when the bank forecloses , i'm gonna buy your shop and turn it into a more viable cash cow ,
like a bally's or a jamba juice .
we could bypass all the stress if you would sell it to me now .
but of course you wouldn't do that ... too much pride .
and i respect that .
i respect that , too .
you be safe out there .
i was gonna say the same thing to you .
what did slick head negro want?
these guys fittin 'to open a shop on our block?
they're gonna take all our customers .
quality land development buyin 'up everything .
we just gotta step up our game .
hey , rick , you handled that deposit for me?
you gonna have to cool it on these extra activities .
i don't care about your vampire hours as long as you do what i ask .
it's not what you think .
i had some ...
some bullshit to do .
you should've asked me , someone more dependable .
both of you can kiss my ass .
hold up , don't fall apart .
don't fall apart .
not right now , okay?
we got competition on the block .
and i guess change , that's a good thing , right?
well , it's free enterprise .
this is america .
shut up , dinka .
survival of the fittest .
says the privileged white boy .
the privileged white boy do a better job on that fade .
you're starting to cross the line .
relax yourself .
quit it .
quit it .
don't sweat it , cal .
we got your back no matter what .
come on , everybody , let's go back .
this ain't nothin '.
i've seen this many times .
they come and they go .
we gonna be all right .
we gonna be fine .
man , why you trippin 'back there?
why you frontin ', man?
i know you're supposed to be the superstar , but don't you ever roll up on my customers .
what was you thinkin '?
you're right , man .
okay , it's my bad .
it's my bad .
his fade was a little crooked , though .
it's hard being that good , ain't it?
look , cal , it's nappy cutz .
com .
it's the professionalism that is bestowed upon me
when i come into nappy cutz that i appreciate .
did that boy say " bestowed upon me "?
that's what it sounded like .
it's the bikini waxes that i love ...
look at the couches , man , and the lighting .
look at that .
last week i had me a milk bath .
what?
oh , baby .
they dippin 'sisters in milk over there?
give me some cookies .
i'll go over there myself .
was that ...
that was him !
it looked like him .
that's a look alike .
how can they get him?
turn that mess off .
that little girl is nasty !
back to work .
checker fred , back to checkers .
my boys up in memphis go to nappy cut .
they said it's off the chain .
they got honeys in bikinis , be serving wine when they walk through the door .
that ain't nothin '.
i heard they got fish in the floor , swimming .
you standin 'on top of them .
you could pick a fish out , get it baked , broiled , fried , grilled , fondued , souffld ,
sauted , sushied , all that .
fondued?
i like that whole massage thing .
that's tight .
let me tell you all somethin '.
that's not a real barbershop .
that's a fake , franchise , corporate version of a barbershop .
that's why they got gimmicks .
they ain't got no real character up in there .
a real barbershop got real people , real conversation , and most of all , real barbers , and that's what we got here .
calvin , my man !
oh , god .
kenard .
hold up .
dude , look ...
i love you , cuz .
i love you , man .
i finished barber school on wednesday , and now i'm working in a shop today .

maybe?
i'm down with trying out .
i'm about to be rookie of the year up in here .
that's me , man?

kenard's chair .
that aroma is kind of gettin 'to me .
what kind of coffee is that?
it's not a coffee .
it's a chai with soy .
okay , so it's herbal .
yeah , it's herbal .
you must be a lot like me .
you lactose intolerant .
yeah , i'm lactose intolerant .
i go near a cow , and my behind blow up like dizzy gillespie .
downright flatulent .
and the smell .
man , the smell that come out of there , it's so bad , sometimes i have to set myself outside .
i'm not lactose intolerant , all right?
i have a very healthy metabolism .
i tried to have some of them little , bitty milky ways ... the small one .
i ate two of them at a party one night , and , man , it just got ...
i just couldn't control it .
it was the lactose intoleration .
listen , i'm not lactose intolerant .
look , man , all that's fine .
i'm trying to help you .
it's just not fair for your date .
you gotta think about if you on a date and you up here sneakin ''em off , and she's trying to wonder ,
he seem like he dressed nice , he seems clean , but what is that smell?
and you tryin 'to act like you ain't got no ...
take care of yourself .
sir , i am very nice to black people , okay?
nice to black people?
you better be , especially me .
i keep my stuff with me , okay?
i cut you .
you can look me up on the internet , www . cut a mother . com .
that's me right there lookin 'at you .
hey , watch it !

your precious love
your precious love
heaven must have sent you from above
must have sent you , baby
heaven must have sent your precious love

your finger goin 'up there , but you not .
i need to find a new tenor .
man .
i wish my brother darnell was out .
eddie , where you goin '?
what the hell's the matter with you?

there's a guy on the other side of the rig !
get off the truck !
get off !
you wanna know my name , right?
yeah .
loretta .
yeah .
i'm not saying we made out of money .
i'm just saying we need to step it up a little bit .
we're about to get punked by nappy cutz .
if you don't think big , you'll never be big .
calvin , you run a family operation .
you do not need to step it up .
them clowns at nappy cutz , they're not about to take away your business .
your shop is a neighborhood institution .
come on .
people don't care about institutions .
they got fish in the floor .
just swimmin 'around .
you can get it fried , baked , sauted , sushi ...
who told you that?
little rodney at the shop .
little rodney told you he sawfish in the floor .
well , he actually didn't see the fish in the floor , but his cousin in atlanta sawfish .
you know that's ridiculous .
little rodney probably heard it from somebody who heard it from somebody else who was at nappy cutz when they dropped their filet o fish on the floor .
that's ridiculous .
i can't believe you said that .
sun salutation , ladies .
feet together , bringing it to prayer pose .
and reach !
butterfly , butterfly .
bringing it back to prayer pose .
deep ujjayi breath .
breathing in radiance , beauty , light .
breathing out any heavy burdens .
the key to enlightenment is to work through your anger , not have your anger work through you .
first position .
one , two , three .
he ain't shit !
he ain't shit !
jimmy !
what's the deal?
what's up?
lookin 'good , baby boy !
always , always .
still ain't shit .
just a little while ago , he was cuttin 'hair .
good morning .
good morning .
alderman brown's office .
good morning , maggie .
good morning , sir .
any messages?
yes , sir .
a whole stack .
good morning , alderman .
good morning .
good morning , sir .
good morning , jimmy .
i'd like a moment if you have it .
i don't .
this faithful constituent is in need of counsel , and i have to provide it .
reach one , teach one .
remember that .
it's an issue of vital importance and it'll only take a minute .
you have 59 seconds .
thank you .
have a seat .
thank you , sir .
not you .
i wanted to bring to your attention a particular concern of mine .
are you familiar with calvin's barbershop on 79th and exchange?
yeah , i'm aware of it .
they're opening a nappy cutz across the street .
yeah , i know all about it .
shouldn't we do something about that?
why should we?
competition is a cornerstone of democracy .
the future is not what it used to be .
remember that .
but you did say you wanted to keep that particular area fertile for small business interests .
fertile .
i did say that , didn't i?
this boy is gonna be the governor of the state of illinois one day if he learns to do what i say when i say it .
now , i'm not one for explanations , explanatory things explained .
write a report and have it on my desk by the end of the month .
sir , i think we should move faster than that .
think need , not speed .
it's better to measure a thing ten times and cut once than to measure once and cut ten times .
your minute is up , son .
this is gonna be great for the neighborhood .
we'll see .
here he comes .
what's up , samir?
not much .
how are you doing?
all right .
very nice shirt on you .
we need to talk to you , calvin .
what's going on?
we've been approached by quality land development .
they're building a cineplex there and they're making us an offer .
we're thinking about taking that offer .
the money isn't bad .
plus , the money isn't bad .
stew sold him his cleaners and took his viagra popping ass to miami .
i ain't mad at the brother .
what's that got to do with me?
you got your mind made up .
no , we haven't .
but i bet if you came on board and sold them the barbershop , they'd probably pay us double .
that would change my mind .
absolutely .
y'all know i can't do that .
why not?
we've been there since '58 .
so if y'all wanna sell and go down to florida with them funky ass voting booths , you can go ahead .
but i've gotta keep mine .
you're making a mistake , bro .
no , my friend , you're thinking about this all the wrong way .
calvin , there's a lot of money to be made here , son .
go talk to your boy .
come on , babies .
today is the day .
we came a long road to get here .
pay attention .
lighten up .
you come in here some days
looking like joe frazier in jamaica .
people don't like that .
you're too pretty .
learn how to cook .
i know how to cook .
make him hush puppies or a spanish omelet .
hey there , calvin .
hey , calvin .
what's up , cal?
yo , isaac .
what's up , boss man?
you all know why i called this meeting .
nappy necks , whatever they want to call theyself across the street , is openin 'up in three weeks , and they're tryin 'to get our ass out of here ,
like it or not , and we ain't havin 'it .
you know what i mean?
damn straight .
so my plan is this .
fire up the barbecue in the back , have a little customer appreciation cookout .
that's smart .
that's good thinking .
just burgers and dogs , free haircuts for the kids .
show the people we care about 'em .
show them that whatever they goin 'through , we down with them .
you feel me?
i feel you , calvin .
definitely .
man , i feel all of that .
it all makes sense .
that's why i got to raise your booth rent .
what?
you can't do that .
it's my first day .
why , calvin?
we got to pay for this somehow .
forget about it .
we in a crisis , and you can double my rent .
you don't even pay no rent .
what?
in that case , triple it , then .
not to throw salt , but why you don't pay no booth rent?
i don't pay rent 'cause i don't pay rent .
okay?
so pour out your cup of haterade and sop it up off the floor and get some business .
also , i want to institute a couple of new rules .
you comin 'at me with too much .
that's all for one day .
take baby steps .
rule number one ... no more profanity .
i know you about to say something .
don't even say it .
i ain't sayin 'nothin '.
i'm thinkin 'it .
rule number two ... don't be late .
who was it that said , " be on time for something other than ...
" ... before 11 : 00 at the club . " that's what it was .
y'all got jokes .
my bad .
kenard , them jet beauties , they got to go , man .
good .
they're my inspiration , my muses .
he made me take down my picture of lola falana .
i can't cut without the butt .
that's perfect for me 'cause maybe you'll quit .
that's what i thought .
we're going to be more family friendly around here , and i want everybody to start greeting the customers by name .
how are we supposed to know everybody's name?
that's ridiculous .
he's not even showing up .
yap !
yap !
yap !
yap !
all that yapping leads me to rule number three ... no more loud talking .
what? !
watch it .
thank you , calvin .
horace , thanks , man .
i appreciate your coming through .
all right , calvin .
take care , man .
no problem .
appreciate your business .
all right , calvin .
god bless .
all right , calvin .
bye , horace .
you're next .
what's up , cal?
thanks for what you're doing .
we appreciate it .
hi , jimmy !
hey , everybody .
this is not happening .
we got an appointment .
you gotta get out of the chair .
eight mile gave me this time exactly .
we're almost done .
i'll be right with you .
i'm terribly sorry about the inconvenience .
calvin , this is why black business does not succeed .
we're never on time .
you're always coming in late .
you leave early .
giving to the needy and the greedy instead of the deserving .
and double booking our clients !
why do you have a schedule if you ain't gonna use it?
it is 11 : 02 .
that means your man has to get out of the chair .
that means it's my time , and i'm not havin 'it .
come on , man , you gotta bounce .
this is ridiculous .
vamoose .
come on , let's go .
get him .
sit your ass down !
come on , have a seat .
enough of it already .
sit on down , west wing .
up in here like you're from lifestyles of the rich and famous .
only reason you're in here is 'cause your daddy didn't use a life style .
i'll tell y'all one thing ... all y'all are doomed to fail .
it was nice and quiet in here , the way i like it .
just hush .
everything was hush .
free barbecue ... food , fun , and free haircuts for the kids .
bring 'em on down .
bring all the kids .
here you go , girl .
we should have kids so we can bring 'em down to this barbecue friday .
i think we can squeeze four out of that ass .
i didn't mean to insult you .
we could probably get five .

eddie , you need to quit it .

you don't need to watch it .
she throwin 'it at you , dawg .
what's up with that?
shawna is a nice woman , but i don't know if she's the one for me .
who the one for you?
terri?
you need to let that go .
that's not gonna happen .
that's the good news .
you don't need a loud , evil , neck rollin 'chicken head like terri .
that's what you need .
go on .
go on over there .
go on .
isaac , run to the store and grab me some ice .
we're running short on ice .
kenard ain't doin 'nothin '.

no disrespect , cal , but i've been bustin 'my ass in there for you .
i've been bringin 'in a lot of business .

i should've known you was out here actin 'a fool .
i'm tryin 'to teach little sister souljah here some discipline .
now , it's obvious the way she bein 'raised , she headed straight for the peniten sherary .
raised?
maybe if you stopped raising your hand to your mouth , you wouldn't look like shamu of the south side .
okay .
i see where you're trying to go with it .
what kind of man treat a little girl that way?
i wouldn't expect you to know what a man is .
but i'm gonna give you a clue .
give you a hint , throw you a lifeline .
it's one of them things you can't keep !
oh , i can keep a man .
i can keep a man .
no , you can't .
i ain't want you , calvin .

the last woman you slept with was battery operated .

exactly .
i got a question .

you can say that again .
goodness !

you can't fry none of that , though .
you can play ball up in here , man .
no , you can play ball down the street .
like a brother can't get a haircut without trying to play some ball .
they got the wall street journal .
top of the line .
this is what a barbershop's supposed to look like .
this is leather .
word?
that's pleather .
it's leather .
it's ugly .
lookin 'around , it's a nice shop , but it don't have no character .
exactly .
what we got across the street is character .
we got character , we got conversation , and we got ...
we ain't got one of these .
lord have mercy !
this is pillow top !
come on , city hall , show me what you got .
you're startin 'to get on my nerves .

hey , detective .
we was just lookin 'for you .

we heard something ...
you broke into nappy cutz?
you take anything?

oh , man , they got a basketball court !
he's beautiful , isn't he?
i just want him to have everything i never had .
i know you do .
and he will .
so you coming to bed?
yeah .
you tryin 'to get something started?
i was hoping so , but you better catch me before the rollers go in .

put them rollers in .
i might like that .
i got contact lenses ... blue , green , bloodshot red ... left ones only .
ray !
just the man i wanted to see .
come back and talk to me .
i didn't know you was workin '.
come holler at me .
how's life been treating you?
it's been cool .
me and my girlfriend's husband got in a fight .
he only won 'cause she helped him .
good to see you .
come on back .
in the back back?
yeah , in the back back .
with the scissors and everything?
how you been , cal?
you been going to church and living your life right and everything?
what you jumping for?
i ain't know what you was comin 'with .
my nerves bad .
i'm light skinned .
can you get this stuff on this list?
i'm looking to get high end stuff at low end prices .
you know i can .
legally .
you mean like with a receipt legally?
like i ain't steal it .
if the police walk up , do i gotta drop it and run?
i can get anything you need .
nappy cutz won't know what hit 'em .
this is not about nappy cutz .
this is about personal enhancement , personal growth .
expansion .
not nappy cutz .
right .
they won't know what hit 'em .
come on over here and get your hair cut .
i'm working at calvin jr's .
come be my first customer .
what you mean , " uh uh "?
can you hook me up with isaac?
the one with the " i " cut in the back?
you got a 'fro !
you can't be gettin 'the " i " cut in the back .
condoleezza .
with all that white house money she makin ', you'd think she could afford herself a makeover .
if i was in the white house , i'd be fly all the time .
if you was in the white house , you'd be ghetto as hell .
she'd have the president all corn rowed out , talking about , " u. s. , fool .
u. s. , fool .
the president would be a thug .
she think a head of state's a sexual position .
i'm inviting heads of state today .
oh , my god .
please stop .
gina , do i look like beyonc?
just like her .
i knew you was gonna say that .
give me some .
this is like the world coming together ,
like all the gangs coming together .
there's beauty in there .
you gotta love it , man .

yeah , yeah .
beautiful .
what is it , a uterus?
calvin , i hooked you up with the alderman .
what'd you do , get me some handicapped plates?
better .
you're gonna be on the news .
the news?
the alderman's taking a walking tour of the block before friday's city council meeting to let the constituency know that he's concerned .
concerned?
about november , right?
i talked him into talking to you ... good publicity .
you could've asked me first .
i know .
but it was a spur of the moment thing .
we don't do politics in here .
it's a place of business .
this ain't no community center .
you know what?
you sound just like your daddy right now .
we will not be silenced .
when the fbi gassed the black panthers out , we found a place to be today .
thank you , brother calvin .
brother calvin !
we will continue to provide books and classes , food and clothing through our outreach program .
that's right , brother .
and when the pigs show up , they're gonna show up with guns .
we ain't gonna do nothin 'but show up with our guns !
then they gonna start shootin '.
then we gonna start shootin '!
that's right , brother !
i'm tellin 'you , every last one of them's gonna get shot !
that's right .
then all of us is gonna get shot !
and all of us is gonna die together !
let's make it happen !
black power !
black power !
black power !
yeah !
black power !
that's us !
black power !
power to the people !
shit , man , them fools crazy .
well , if it ain't lalowe sharpton .
my goodness , my goodness .
the barbershop .
how you doin '?
lalowe brown .
checker fred , sir .
how you doin ', checker?
lalowe brown .
good to see you .
how you doin ', sir?
my , my .
well , well , look at this .
look what we got ... we got a lady barber .
we didn't have this back in the day .
what's your name?
terri .
sarah?
terri .
lalowe's gonna have to come back and let you give me a little trim .
trim?
a haircut .
terri , if you wanna be down , vote lalowe brown .
you remember that .
this is calvin's barbershop .
this is a cornerstone of the black community for some 40 odd years .
i've been coming down here many a saturday afternoon , get myself straight for sunday morning .
but i wanna introduce you to the man himself , the man who quantifies and epitomizes the institutional possibilities of black hair .
he is a potentiating progenitor in all kinds of fine ways .
he's my fine friend , this brother right here , calvin .
how you doin '?
calvin palmer .
how you doin ', son?
all right .
calvin , you are a pillar of this fine community .
how is everything going for you with all this social change happening down here?
well , mr. brown , as you know , there is a lot of change ...
there is a lot of change , and change is hard sometimes , right?
but if we want to stand together as a community ,
we will find a way to survive .
tell it !
tell it , lo .
that's right .
you let lalowe lay it down for you .
if you wanna stay afloat , we got to ... ... you gonna have to rock the boat .
because if they want to send us packin ', baby , it's on and crackin '!
and if they try to mess with this brother , then it's gonna be on like a mother !
that's a little rough .
if you want to stay around , y'all know what you gotta do .
vote for lalowe brown !
hey , calvin , why don't you get me a little shape up?
'cause i've been running around .
you got a chair for me?
yeah , right here .
of course we got one for you .
kenard !
kenard !
let kenard cut your hair .
hold on , hold on .
wait a minute .
no .
get on over there , get low .
sit right on down , so low .
nice to meet you .
how you doin '?
wait a minute .
it's okay .
it's okay .
it's okay .
it's okay .
kenard here is one of our prima donna barbers .
front chair .
you ain't had your hair cut till ...
kenard .
yeah .
yeah .
let's take a picture .
thank you , brother .
yeah , okay .
all right .
enjoy yourself , low below .
you just relax , down low .
we on tv , man .
i know .
this is must see tv .
it's gonna be good .
this is why i love this community ,
'cause there's a historical context for every action that takes place here .
i plan to die here .
we're running short on time .
if we could speed this up?
you can't rush the best , jimmy .
he ain't the best .
he ain't ask you , man .
well , who's the best , then , youngblood?
you the best?
no doubt .
isaac rosenberg .
the best barber in the state of illinois .
the best barber on this rock we call earth .
come on down to cal's .
our rainbow coalition right here .
yeah , this is integration right here .
what's up , ma?
richie?
you're feelin 'yourself way too much .
don't sweat the technique .
what technique?
you cut like a bitch .
carvin 'i's in the back of people's head?
your skills is limited .
my skills are limited?
where your skills at?
this ain't the time .
ain't in cuttin 'hair .
must be slobbin 'terri in the locker room .
what?
no .
you ain't supposed to air our dirty laundry like that .
we on tv .
what is he talking about?
dinka , it wasn't like that . ... of populist politics .
thug love !
thug love !
it was not like that .
everybody's hatin 'on me .
'cause i'm competent?
you don't make this shop .
i have lately .
i will confront all of those forces that are trying to change , that are trying to make things happen .
they don't treat barbers like this at nappy cutz .
why don't you go find out?
you on that bullshit .
go find out .
we don't need you around here if you don't wanna be here .
fine , man .
all right .
get out of the chair , man .
no , you stay here .
in november , i plan to establish this barbershop as my headquarters .
at calvin's barbershop , we're gonna make this institution one of the leading institutions , like a torpedo moving towards the future .
yes , indeed .
all right .
kenard , just a little off the top .
i really think it's time for us to move along .
come on , jimmy , just two seconds .
my bad , brother .
i skipped you .
why don't you just let me fade you up?
how about a nice quo vadis?
what'd you do to my head?
don't even look at that .
is that my head?
i'm gonna kill you !
i'm gonna kill you !
you a grown man !
you don't do that to kenard !
get out of here !
and far from its roots as a family establishment , this was the scene today at 79th and exchange at calvin's barbershop when alderman lalowe brown stopped by for a photo opportunity and haircut .
or shall i say scalping?
needless to say , i doubt very seriously if the alderman will be frequenting calvin's barbershop anytime soon .
nice .
who is it?
it's rick .
what do you want?
i wanna talk to you .
i feel bad .
good .
i'm busy .
open the door .
we gotta talk about this .
there's nothing to discuss .
dinka , i messed up .
what happened between me and terri was foul .
it should have never happened .
i didn't mean to hurt you .
i'm sorry .
apology accepted .
can we discuss this tomorrow?
you remember shawna , right?
hi .
what's up , shawna?
handle that .
i'll get at you tomorrow .
maybe the day after .
you should see her when i'm drinkin '.
'cause i know her .
exactly right , exactly right .
what are you doing here?
the question is , what you doin 'here?
look a little shady to me .
you come up to my shop today and got the nerve to be huddled up with this shark .
don't come in here accusing me of some malicious and egregious act when what you should be doin 'is apologizing for making me look like a goddamn fool today .
that's what you should be doing .
lalowe .
ease up .
it's cool .
all right there , youngblood .
ain't nothin 'going on in here , just business .
i'll bet .
it's true .
in fact , the alderman and i were just talking about you .
well , about your business .
i undervalued the importance of your shop to this community .
that's my bad .
it'd be a shame to see it all go away for naught .
man , i'm from the south side .
don't try to hustle me .
no hustle .
a hustle implies one side wins , the other side loses .
i'm proposing a win win .
i'm proposing that nappy cutz never sees the light of day .
is that right?
i'll turn it into a nightclub .
your barbershop will continue to thrive without any interference from me or from anyone else .
and this miracle happens if i do what?
not tell people what i saw here tonight?
what'd you see tonight?
what'd you see in here tonight , calvin?
nothing .
nothing .
have a seat .
no , i'd rather stand .
all you have to do is talk .
the city council meeting is tomorrow .
we need those other business owners on your block to sell .
if you were to express to them and to the governing board that you believe in quality land's proposal , your voice could be the determining factor .
at least , i think so .
this could be a shitload of money for the whole district .
not to mention , it could be a nice little windfall for calvin .
a $200, 000 windfall .
now , that's a nice piece of pocket change .
you could take your wife on down to jamaica .
the real one , not that one in queens .
it'd be a nice kick start to your kid's college fund .
you have a son , don't you?
yeah , i got a son .
all you gotta do is talk .
$200, 000 .
i'm not asking you for a whole lot , just to ... come on down and ... ... just talk .
just talk .
all right .
see you tomorrow .
win win .
you stalking me?
just wanna talk .
ain't nothin 'to say .
let me drive you to work .
how am i gonna look rollin 'up in your freak mobile?
terri , we work together .
we need to have a conversation .
listen to what i got to say .
after that , you ain't got to speak to me ever again .
i'll drop you off around the corner .
get in the car .
please .
terri , i really ain't been myself lately .
ricky , before you even say anything , i need you to know that thug gangta player bullshit is over for me .
i'm done with that in my life .
but you don't even know me , what i'm about .
i see you every day ...
late , sleepin 'in the locker room , runnin 'ho's day and night .
how is that not knowing you?
boy !
i'm just gettin 'my backpack .
relax .
what is this , a warrant?
why didn't you say anything?
i couldn't tell nobody i was studying for the fuckin 'ged .
it's embarrassing .
but you passed .
yeah .
yeah , but honestly , though , now that i got it ,
i don't even know what it means .
it means you give a damn about your life .
you should be proud .
i'm proud of you .
don't start paying me compliments and stuff ,
'cause then i gotta give one back to you .
we'd be all over each other again , and don't nobody want that .
i don't want it .
for the record ...
i kind of liked the old terri before all the changes .
loud and angry all the time?
real .
all the time .
man , i hope you hittin 'that !
miss emma , is somethin 'wrong?
nothing a little prayer can't handle , or my pistol .
what's the matter?
they wanna make this funky little place into a co op .
what?
i can't afford that down payment .
i'm gonna have to move .
don't you own this place?
just because i don't own it don't mean it's not mine .
you've been livin 'here , like , what?
a long time , long enough to wipe your nasty little butt .
and a whole lot of others , too .
but it's been worth it , though .
we can't lose you , miss emma .
it's about time for me to retire anyway .
my brother has a nice place out in arizona .
you ever been to arizona?
hot as hell , but i got some nice hats .
how can you leave chicago?
on the bus .
same way i got here .
good morning there , youngblood .
you up early .
they fumigating your crib again?
i thought it'd be a good day to walk and see the trees and dew .
yeah , they fumigating .
i had a cockroach in my house so big , i thought it was shaq .
you're crazy .
let me ask you something .
what?
you done worked and lived around here for what , 34 , 35 years?
yeah , i guess 30 and some change .
i ain't tryin 'to clown , but ...
i hope not .
you know i got jokes .
don't you start nothin '.
let me ask you ... is this the life you wanted?
or did you ever think you could do better?
what the hell keeps you comin 'back here every day?
well , calvin , you know , if i was a bettin 'man ,
i'd say the reason i come back in day in and day out is the free chair .
get real .
hold it !
get off him , pig !
... some very sad news for all of you , and that is that martin luther king was shot and was killed tonight in memphis , tennessee .
in this difficult day , in this difficult time for the united states , it's perhaps well to ask what kind of a nation we are ...
this ain't right .
we should be honoring the man's memory , we shouldn't be doing this .
yeah .
yeah , you're right .
i'm gonna get on out of here .
i need to go check on loretta .
she's talking about moving back to georgia .
i would only say that i can also feel in my own heart the same kind of feeling .
i had a member of my family killed .
but he was killed by a white man .
what we need in the united states ...
you be safe out there .
yeah , i will , man .
don't worry about me .
i'll probably stop by montgomery ward's , pick up a tv , washer and dryer , lamps .
you need anything?
move , eddie !
no !
eddie , get out of there !
no !
no !
i'll stay a little while longer , man .
yeah , so after all that quieted down , your daddy told me i ain't never have to pay for my chair again .
that's the kind of man your father was .
he was a man's man .
he used to always call me a hero .
the funny thing is i never saw it that way .
i didn't save the shop , calvin .
the shop saved me .
a lot like it did for ricky .
i ain't have no life before this .
as far as i'm concerned , my life began on july 4 , 1967 , when i came through that back door and your father gave my black ass a break .
so i'd be sad if somethin 'was to ever happen to this place .
but i'd be all right , though .
oh , yeah , eddie be fine .
hey , what's up , y'all?
calvin , can i have a word with you for a second?
what you want , man?
well , i know these are tough times for you , cuz .
it's times like these when men must rise up and make the right choice .
is that right?
yeah .
it's about the truth .
each and every one of us has our own truth , a truth that we must live with for the rest of our lives .
is there a point to this?
my truth is across the street .
i appreciate the job , cuz .
i'll always love you for it .
but i gotta bounce .
y'all goin 'broke around this mug .
boy , i swear .
all right , all right .
and if anybody wanna come over anytime and hoop it up , ring a player , you know?
all this silence got my gut grumblin '.
i'm gonna run down to berry's , get me a pastrami and fries .
eddie , a man at your age should be watching what he eats .
if you don't knock the fork out of my hand ,
i won't knock the spear out of yours , okay , somalia?
eddie , get me that chicken tamale and strawberry shake special .
get old checkers a ham and cheese on some honky bread , mustard , hold the mayo .
get me a mountain dew and chopped salad .
i'll take some chili fries , onion rings , and a pot pie with egg on it .
okay , that's gonna be three orders of " hell , no " and two sides of " ask your mama " and a large cup of " negro , please .
grumpy old man .
hey , big c , where you headed?
nowhere .
just got a little business to handle .
i'll be back .
and when they build all this stuff , they make it totally unaffordable for the people who live here to stay here .
now , we're south side people with south side money , and that ain't much .
so i'm against the proposed quality land development project on 79th and exchange .
you tell it , sister !
that's right !
very good !
that's right !
quiet .
okay .
before we adjourn and make our decision , is there anyone else who'd like to be heard on this matter?
let's get this thing over with .
i'd like to say somethin '.
sir .
what's he gonna say?
shut up .
shut up .
a little nervous .
i haven't felt like this since i met my wife's pops .
my name is calvin palmer .
i own calvin's barbershop over on 79th .
been there since 1958 .
and all i'd like to say is that all change isn't bad .
who can argue with progress?
better schools , cleaner streets ... something we need on the south side .
and i want the best for my son just like my parents wanted the best for me .
so some change on 79th is well needed and well deserved .
oh , yeah .
also , i'm happy that people outside our community are starting to find the value in our neighborhoods .
but ... if that means selling our soul just to make a quick buck ,
i ain't with that shit .
it's not worth it .
that's why i'm not sellin 'out ... ... like some people i know .
sir , do you know why jesus wept?
no .
no , i don't .
well , when lazarus died ,
martha and mary , they cried over his body .
when jesus sawtheir pain , he couldn't help but cry , too .
so that's why jesus wept .
that's how i feel when i look at people like hank tolliver and gertrude rose and miss emma bein 'driven out ... ... 'cause they don't fit the plan of the new developers .
we gotta realize that people make this community , not $5 coffees and $20 mugs .
it's the people .
and once you lose the people , you lose the neighborhood .
so if i had to say , i would deny
quality land development's proposal to tear up 79th because it just ain't worth it .
thank you .
that's my friend !
that's my friend !
thank you .
thank you , mr. palmer .
we'll take a brief recess and we'll come back with our decision .
you're through .
you know that , don't you?
that was beautiful , man .
thanks .
how much they offer you?
not enough .
we have reached a unanimous decision .
the proposal from quality land development has been approved .
this meeting is over .
what have you done?
that's what i'm talkin 'about .
money , money , money !
