'hello , fulci's . '
hi , i know it's short notice but could you possibly do me a table for two for tonight at about eight?
'sorry , we just gave away the last table . '

they don't do food .
there's a breville out back .
ed , this is serious !
hello .
'hello , it's me . '

i'm going out with david and di .
let's go together .
you hang out with my friends?

that's harsh .
i did not call dianne a failed actress .
let's just go somewhere and have a laugh .
things'll be fine , i promise .
you promised you'd stop smoking .
you promised you'd try drinking red wine instead of beer !
you promised we'd go on holiday .
we went to greece !
we met in greece .
at a rave .
it's not the same .
you promised things would change .
you promised us free cable .
i'm working on that .
i can give up smoking whenever i want .
see , don't need them .
w what was the next one?
it's not enough , shaun .
'we appear to have a breakdown in communication there .
'lf you or someone you know may ... '
i'd say your nine lives were up , shaun .
get fucked , four eyes !
you go out with her , you love her so much .
what do you mean by that?
'... the devastation really is extensive .
it's a total mess . '
i don't know what he meant by that .
got you these .
" to a wonderful mum "?
oooh !
yeah , that's because ...
i thought it would be funny because of what you said last night about you don't want to be my mum and that .
it's just a little joke , just sort of spur of the moment .
they're for your mum , aren't they?
yeah .
smooth .
if i don't do something , i'll end up in that pub for the rest of my life like those other sad old fuckers wondering what the hell happened .
what do you mean do something?
fuck her .
you got your pint .
you got your pig snacks .
what more do you want?
oh .
you want your favourite monkey?

# if you leave me now ... #
who the hell put this on?
it's on random .
for fuck's sake .
john , yes please , mate .
you know what we should do tomorrow?
keep drinking .
a bloody mary first thing , a bite at the king's head , couple at the little princess , stagger back here and bang ... back at the bar for shots .
how's that for a slice of fried gold?
no .
come on , man .
talk to me .
she said if she stayed with me she'd end up in here for the rest of her life
like these sad old fuckers wondering what the hell happened .
that is harsh .
these are rich , interesting characters .
like who?
snakehips .
always surrounded by women .
he's a bigamist .
strangled his first wife with a draught excluder .
and invented the mobile disco .
what about her , then?
ooh !
cockacidal maniac .
she's an ex porn star .
they say she starred in the world's first interracial hardcore loop .
cafe au lait ...
pour vous .

the pub's called the winchester .
exactly .
see , you don't need liz to have a good time .
don't , man .
no .
oi , look at me .
can i just say one thing?
i'm not gonna say there's plenty more fish in the sea ,
i'm not gonna say if you love her let her go and i'm not gonna bombard you with clichs but what i will say is this ... it's not the end of the world .
sorry , we're closed .
pisshead .
# ooh , white lines
# visions , dreams of passion

'then we grab mum , go over to liz's place ,
'hole up , have a cup of tea
'and wait for all this to blow over . '
why have we got to go to liz's?
because we do .
she dumped you .
i have to know if she's all right .
why?
because i love her .

i'm not staying there , though .
why not?
if we hole up , i want to be somewhere familiar ,
i wanna know where the exits are and i wanna be allowed to smoke .
ok ...
'take pete's car , go round mum's ,

oh !
no , there they are .
ok , let's do this , yeah?
yeah?

hello?
he's gonna be dead either way .
that's not the point .
oh , thank god for that .
ah , hello .
who's a pretty boy then?
you didn't say barbara had a jag .
i've always wanted to drive a jag .
it's philip's .
he won't let anybody near it .
i put a mars bar in it once and he chased me with a bit of wood .
fuck , it's gorgeous .
it seems pretty clear , we should go .
why don't i stay here?
what , what , what , what , what?
you know , just look after the car .
if there's any problems ...
i'll honk three times .
ok .
don't forget to kill philip !
hello , pickle .
hi , mum .
you've got red on you .
yeah .
mum , is everything ok?
are you all right?
yes , i'm fine .
where's philip?
dad's in the lounge .
he's not my dad .
really !
ed's outside , we'll take you somewhere safe .
what about the doctor?
i don't think he's gonna come .
philip won't want to leave the house .
philip isn't ...

no .
yes .
your toys are upstairs .
i was going to give them to the jumble .
i took them all to the tip , barbara .
what?
shaun wants to take us somewhere .
don't be silly .
maybe you should stay here and wait for the doctor .
you said he wasn't coming .
you didn't call the doctor?
just to be on the safe side .
i'm fine .
i ran it under a cold tap .
we had ourjabs when we went to the isle of wight .
but , philip ...
it's overblown nonsense .
a lot of drug nuts running wild .
but i should get mum away .
i'm not going anywhere without philip .
mum , look !
how about that tea?
mum , how much do you love philip?
two sugars , is it?
i haven't had sugar in my tea since 1982 .
oh , yes .
will you cut me some bread , love?
mum , look , how much do you love philip?
do we have to go through all that again?
what would you say if i told you that philip's been quite unkind to me?
you weren't easy to live with .
he chased me with a bit of wood !
you did call him a you know what .
did he tell you that?
motherfucker .
shaun !
sorry , mother ...
mum !
did you know that on several occasions ... he touched me?
that wasn't true .
made it up , shouldn't have , sorry .
you don't understand ...
no , you don't understand .
philip is my husband and has been for 17 years and i would at least expect you to respect my feelings .
you must be more adult about these things .
yeah .
come on , shaun .
there comes a time when ... you just ... gotta be a man .
i'm telling you , it's a fuss over nothing .
hello , edward .
hi , barbara .
my , how you've grown .
you better believe it .
what happened?
why is he coming?
it wasn't as easy as all that .
are we following you?
no , it's probably best if we ...
where's the car?
hmm ...
i pranged it .
you were parked .
yeah .
i guess we'll have to take the jag .
philip?
what?
look out !
christ !
give me the car keys !
you're not driving that car .
give me the car keys !
ed , get mum in the car .
i'm on it .
don't worry about me .
worry about your mother .
maybe i should drive .
i've adjusted the seat now .
just be careful !
can you please turn that noise down?
are you all right , dear?
would you like another tissue?
i'd be fine if it weren't for that bloody racket .
it is a bit loud .
sorry , barbara .
you do realise this is a 20 mile an hour zone?
oh , yeah .
here .
mum , this won't take a second , all right?
have you still got the child locks on?
safety first , shaun .
you can't ...
hey , man , watch the leather .
keep moving .
if there's any problems ...
i'll do the honks .
'hello? '
hello?
guys , can you let me in?
what are you doing?
i've come to get you .
what are you doing?
i've come to take you somewhere safe .
we were safe !
you don't know that .
there was two of them out there .
how many are there now?
lots .
lots !
it only takes one of them to know you're in here .
i tried calling but i couldn't get through .
i had to come up with a plan .
oh , you made a plan?
we have to get out of here .
if we don't , they'll tear us to pieces .
and that will exacerbate things for all of us .
shaun ...
this is not about you and me .
this is about survival .
we need to be somewhere more secure , somewhere we can stay alive .
we're with you , shaun .
what?
we're with you .
i'm not going out there .
daffs !
i don't want to be torn to pieces and if you think about it , neither do you .
i'm not going if lizzie's not going .
she's going .
i'm not staying by myself .
you're going , aren't you?
lizzie?
liz?
all right , flash , what's your plan?
great .
i've got a car but it's gonna be a bit cramped now .
has anyone got transport?
yes !
great .
where?
oh , no .
well , i've passed my test .
david?
i don't see the point of owning a car in london .
look , just get any blunt objects together .
if you get cornered , bash them in the head .
keep together , stay sharp and follow me .
so , what's the plan , then?
we're going to the winchester .
ok?
let's go .
come on .
where's the car?
what's up , niggaz?
apologies for the cramped conditions .
di , stay on david's lap .
philip , hang in there , ok?
ed , get there fast .
and , mum , this is liz .
liz , mum .
hello .
ed , be careful .
is your dad all right?
he's not my dad .
he's bleeding .
i know !
ed , be careful .
thought you wanted to get there fast?
i want to get there in one piece !
why are we going this way?
chill out , it's a short cut .
that road goes to the winchester .
shaun ...
liz , please !
i don't understand why the winchester?
it's a pub , it's safe , it's secure .
they know us .
what makes it so secure?
it's got big heavy doors and deadbolts .
and there's a rifle above the bar .
i would think that's deactivated .
it's not .
john's connected .
big al says so .
big al also says dogs can't look up .
they can't .
can't they?
of course they can !
are you sure?
yes !
the pub is the right place to go .
everything is gonna be fine .
shaun ...
i turned it off , all right?
what?
being a father , it's not easy .
what?
you were 12 when i met you , you'd already grown up so much .
i just wanted you to be strong and not give up because you lost your dad .
philip , you don't have to explain .
no , i do .
i always loved you , shaun .
and i always thought you had it in you to do well .
you just need ... m motivation .
somebody to look up to and ...
i thought it could be me .
would you just ... take care of your mum?
there's a good boy .
ed , can you pull over?
two seconds .
ah !
ed , please pull over .
what for?
just pull over !
all right .
whoa , momma !
what the hell are you doing?
chill out .
everyone's all right .
stop telling me to chill out !
and everybody is not all right .
what's wrong?
mum , it's philip , he's gone .
where's he gone?
mum , he's dead .
no , he isn't .
get out !
jesus !
get it open !
ed , get the child locks !
quick !
the child lock !
ed !
now what?
we keep moving .
how do we get philip out the car?
we haven't got time .
we can't leave your dad .
he's not my dad !
mum , he was , but he's not any more .
i really think we could ...
that's not your husband in there .
ok?
it looks like him but there is nothing of the man you loved in that car .
let's go , shall we?
you're not suggesting we walk?
everybody ok?
yeah , we're having a whale of a time .
maybe we should all hold hands , make a crocodile?
do you know where we're going?
david , come on .
sorry .
do you , though?
yeah , totally .
are we close?
we're pretty close .
is your mum gonna be ok?
yeah , i hope so .
did you contact your folks?
they're in antigua .
do you think this is happening there?
i hope not .
about last night .
i know loads of things were said but ...
you said this wasn't about us .
no , it's not .
you said it was about survival .
it is , but ...
you're notjust trying to prove something?
i meant everything i said last night .
maybe this isn't the best time to talk .
ok .
shaun .
yvonne .
how's it going?
er , surviving .
hey , liz .
long time no see .
hey , yvonne .
erm ... this is my boyfriend , declan .
erm ... my friends mark , maggie ,
my mum and my cousin tom .
all right .
this is shaun and his girlfriend liz .
they've split up , actually .
oh , really?
yeah .
that's a shame .
we should scoot .
have you got somewhere you're going?
yeah , we're going to the winchester .
the pub?
yeah .
right , well .
good luck !
hi .
hello .
hi .
hello .
all right .
see?
the winchester's just over there .
over where?
over there .
just over there , over the 20 garden fences?
what's the matter , david?
never taken a short cut before?
shaun .
i'm sure jill and derek live round here .
now , the winchester is just over that fence , all right?
everyone stay where they are , i'll ...
are we all here?
one , two , three , four , five .
yes .
there's six of us .
mum !
i'm coming !
mum , are you ok?
are you ok?
i don't think jill and derek do live here .
shaun?
are you all right?
what are you doing?
shaun !
yes !
no , that's rubbish .
ooh !
yes !
feel free to step in any time .
you did all right .
i didn't want to cramp your style .
i'm so sorry about that .
right .
ok , everyone stay where they are .
i'm gonna check if the coast is clear .
is it clear?
no .
how many?
lots .
oh , well , that is just great .
there are a fair few of them , yes .
i trust shaun has another genius scheme up his sleeve?
this is hardly constructive , david !
we should have stayed at the flat .
why didn't you?
because ...
because , because of ...
captain wow .
will you stop it?
we'll get nowhere moaning .
right , let's all shake out .
get nice and limber .
or not .
take another look at the way he moves .
remember , very limp .
almost like sleepwalking .
look at the face , it's vacant with a hint of sadness .
like a drunk who's lost a bet .
ok , let's try , shall we?
liz .
nice .
good vocal work .
ok .
barbara , that's excellent .
sorry , dear , i was miles away .
d daffs .
uh .
come on !
urgh .
it's mournful , sorrowful , you're dead and you hate it .
go .
uuurgh .
much better .
ed .
i'll do it on the night .
this is the night !
what is that?
what about yours?
who died and made you fucking king of the zombies?
don't ...
yeah , that's pretty good .
right , let's all try together , shall we?
one , two , three .
go , go , go , go .
shit !
get round me , get round me !
john?
john , bernie , are you there?
it's shaun and ed .
we come in all the time .
they can hear you .
we do the quiz .
they know .
stay in character !
i can't see them .
shaun , we have to get inside .
break the window .
we'll be exposed !
break the window !
is there another way in?
yeah , there's ...
two seconds .
hey , noodle .
'all right? 'yeah , man , i can't talk now .
'you get anything yet? 'i got nothing .
i'm in the middle of something .
yeah , it's weird .
oi !
what are you doing?
what are you doing?
you stupid moron .
fuck off .
you fuck off !
fuck fucking off !
i've spent an entire life ...
look at me .
i've spent my entire life sticking up for you and all you ever do is fuck things up and make me look stupid .
i'm not gonna let you do it any more .
not today !
shaun .
oh .
you were saying about another way in?
yeah , there's a ...
what are you doing?
no !
get inside .
no , they'll follow us .
keep up the act , i'll have to do something .
what do you mean do something?
hello , hello , over here !
come on , that's it .
come on , that's it , over here !
over here !
come on .
oh , bollocks .
wait till i've gone then get inside .
gone where?
i won't be long , i promise .
come on , you pasty faced fuckers , let's go !
follow me .
come on , this way , that's it !
come on .
this way , follow me .
come on , follow me .
come and get it .
it's a running buffet .
all you can eat !
shall we go in , then?
come on , barbara .
leave those .
i think they're for me .
he's been gone a good 20 minutes .
17 .
either way , we need to think about blocking up this window .
we're totally exposed .
how will shaun get back in?
i'm sure he'll knock .
let's get some lights on .
david , wait !
power's off .
that's a good thing .
we mustn't advertise our whereabouts .
no , of course not .
do we , david?
no , of course not , lizzie .
i'm just being proactive .
there's no lights , no power .
and there's a hole in the window .
you did that , you twat .
somebody had to do something !
we were in a spot of bother .
somebody has to take control of the situation and if none of you are prepared to accept that responsibility then perhaps ...
i should .
will shaun be gone long?
he'll be back soon .
how do you know?
i don't think he'd leave us .
wouldn't he?
how can you trust a man you binned for being unreliable?
a man whose idea of a romantic nightspot is also an impenetrable fortress .
this is a pub !
we are in a pub !
what are we going to do?
i could get a round in .
let's just wait for shaun .
we'll barricade the window when he gets back .
what then?
how long?
days?
weeks?
a month?
what are we going to eat?
toasties !
there's a breville out back .
great .
saved by nibbles .
must be why shaun took us here before he left .
he's coming back !
why?
because he promised?
if he does , do you think his master plan will be anything more than eating peanuts?
is he just gonna stroll in and suddenly everything's ok?
i don't know , david !
i don't know any more than you do .
but what i do know is that we're here now and we have to make the best of it .
ed , get me a double vodka .
right you are .
i'll have a drink too .
would you like a drink , barbara?
hello .
right , great , fuck it .
we'll have a party and get completely smashed .
we've got our nibbles .
we've got our mini cheddars .
david !
we got twiglets .
oh , look , hog lumps .
pickle !
hello , mum .
you all right?
everybody ok?
yeah .
any sign of john and bernie?
no .
check upstairs?
it's locked .
phones?
dead .
same as the power .
ok ...
nice of you to join us .
yeah , well , i promised , didn't i?
how did you lose them?
i just gave them the slip .
wasn't difficult .
they're not all that .
well , how did you get in?
the back door .
i tried to tell you before you smashed the window .
but it wasn't me blowing our cover by arguing with my boyfriend .
he's not my boyfriend .
might be a bit warm , the cooler's off .
thanks , babe .
so , what's the plan , then?
would anyone like a peanut?
why don't you do your clyde?
has anyone seen every which way but loose?
ed does the most amazing impression of the orang utan .
no , it's not .
it is .
come on .
do it .
no , no .
but it's brilliant .
come on .
you've built it up too much .
no , just do it .
everyone wants to see it .
we could do with a laugh .
do it , do it , do it , do it .
come on , do it .
i'm not a performing monkey .
the power's on .
it's not , i tried it earlier .
the streetlights are on .
i'll flip the fuses , we can watch television .
what about the lights?
yes .
don't advertise our whereabouts .
the lights are on a separate circuit .
just flip the mains breakers .
it's quite simple , david .
is that it?
that's it .
liz , erm ... have you got a quid?
erm ...
yeah .
never anything on , is there?
what?
i think we might have a bit of a problem .
what do you mean?
they followed me .
i thought you said you gave them the slip .
yeah .
well , we'll just have to be extra quiet then , won't we?
what?
ed , no !
turn it off !
shit !
where the hell did he come from?
i dunno .
who put this on?
it's on random .
dianne , get mum somewhere safe .
david , kill the queen .
what? !
the jukebox !
liz , ed , grab a weapon .
what about the rifle?
cocktails?
what do you mean?
the flaming spirits get a rag in , light it .
but the whole place could go up .
what , then?
how about pool?
# don't stop me now
# don't stop me
# cos i'm having ... # john , it's time at the bar .
# i'm a shooting star leaping through the sky like a tiger
# defying the laws of gravity
# i'm a racing car passing by like lady godiva
# i'm gonna go , go , go
# there's no stopping me
# i'm burning through the sky ...
i can't find the switches !
then get the fuses !
# that's why they call me mister fahrenheit
# i'm travelling at the speed of light
# i wanna make a supersonic man out of you
# don't stop me now
# i'm having such a good time
# i'm having a ball
# don't stop me now
# if you wanna have a good time
# just give me a call
# don't stop me now cos i'm having a good time
# don't stop me now
# yes i'm having a good time i don't wanna stop at all
# i'm a rocket ship on my way to mars ...
why is queen still on?
we have a situation !
i know !
fuck this .
two seconds .
ed !
oi !
# oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , explode
# i'm burning through the sky , yeah ...
shaun ! # ... call me mister fahrenheit ...
no !
yes !
yes !
in the head !
ooow !
shauny !
# don't stop me ooh , ooh , ooh
# don't stop me , don't stop me good time , good time
# don't stop me ... #
why didn't you just shoot him , man?
ed , for the last time , it's ...
i fucking knew it !
what did i tell you?
big al was right .
ok .
but dogs can look up .
has anyone fired a gun before?
oh , yeah .
apart from ed?
i'm a pacifist .
apart from david and ed?
what was ed's experience?
he shot his sister in the leg .
i think you should do it .
we should all do it .
how can five people operate one gun?
no one has any experience .
we've got ...
29 .
29 bullets .
call them shells .
29 shells .
i need someone to help me reload , everyone else to look out .
i will fire .
as bertrand russell said the only thing that will redeem mankind is co operation .
i think we can all appreciate that now .
was that on a beer mat?
yeah , it was guinness extra cold .
i won't say anything .
thanks .
they want to come in .
get mum out of the way .
david , dianne , let's go .
ed , give me some shells .
barbara .
oh , hello .
would you like to come with me?
that'd be lovely .
it's nice to meet you , finally .
shaun's always talking about you .
really?
yeah .
ah !
barbara?
are you all right?
i've got something for you .
shaun's father gave me this .
shaun's real father , i mean .
i'd like you to have it .
barbara , shaun and i have ...
it seems only right .
i didn't want to say anything .
i thought shaun would be worried .
liz !
here they come !
stay behind me !
there's one !
sorry , we're closed !
the safety !
that happened to me on stage .
cock it !
there !
where?
three o'clock !
oh !
over there again .
quarter to twelve .
what?
11 : 45 !
keep it simple !
top left !
reload .
i'm on it !
come on , come on .
nice shot .
ok , david , dianne , let's block up this window !
ed , take over a sec .
what is it?
what's wrong?
shaun , i'm so sorry .
mum , what's wrong?
i didn't want to be a bother .
mum , what's wrong?
i didn't want to be a bother .
mum , i don't understand .
the man in his pyjamas .
i didn't want to say anything , i thought you'd be upset .
no , you should've said .
take over a sec .
what's going on?
what's up?
what the hell's going on?
barbara's hurt !
just take over a minute .
jesus .
i know first aid .
just hang on .
mum !
mum .
is she ...?
just hold on , mum , you're gonna be fine .
i never thanked you .
for what?
for these .
to a wonderful mum .
it's been a funny sort of day , hasn't it?
oh , no , no !
mum , come on .
stop it , stop it , stop it .
mum .
please don't go .
what are you doing?
we have to deal with her .
daffs !
for christ's sake !
she's gonna come back !
she's not going anywhere .
she'll change .
she's my mum !
she's a zombie .
don't say that .
move aside .
i'm gonna count to three .
one ... two ... three !
don't point that gun at my mum !
calm down .
don't point that gun at barbara !
ed , don't exacerbate things !
what's that mean?
this isn't exactly fair .
here .
thank you .
it's ok .
please , can we just stop and think about this?
tell him to put the gun down !
she's gonna change .
you know i'm right .
and when she does , she'll kill all of us .
that's what your ex can't seem to realise .
that's what this is about , isn't it?
he doesn't like me !
he's always hated me and now he wants to shoot my mum .
she's not ...
you've never thought i was good enough .
what?
we all know you're in love with liz .
that is not true .
yes it is !
that is not true .
yes it is .
what?
i know you only hung out with me to get close to liz and when she knocked you back , i was there to pick up the pieces .
i've come to terms with that , daffs , why can't you?
lizzie , i want you to know that my feelings for you ...
david !
there are slightly more pressing matters at hand here .
like " daffs " pointing a gun at my mum .
i'm not being unreasonable , " pickle " .
christ , she's not dead !
she's finished .
for a hero , you're quite a hypocrite .
you've gone from a chartered accountant to charlton heston .
i'm not a chartered accountant .
well , you look like one .
yeah .
i'm a lecturer .
you're a twat .
she's not your mum .
in a minute she'll be just another zombie .
don't say that .
we're not using the z word .
please can we just calm the fuck down !
now , i can see what david is trying to say ...
thank you .
even if he is being a twat .
yep .
and , shaun ...
shaun , look at me .
i can't begin to imagine how hard this must be for you but we can't afford to fall apart .
shaun , babe ...
i know you don't wanna hear this ...
you do it .
i'm sorry , mum .
do it !
well ...
i think we're all agreed , you did the right thing there .
david , no !
david !
right , i'm leaving .
what?
i'm not staying here .
david , it's suicide .
i think you should go .
we will .
we can defend ourselves .
what do you mean " we "?
what do you mean?
opening that door now would be a very silly thing to do .
you gonna stay here with him?
look ...
after where he led us?
let me finish !
shaun didn't ask you to come here .
you came for the same reason i did .
get away from that door this instant !
but ...
david !
i'm so sorry , dianne .
maybe i'm not the one you should be apologising to .
shaun ...
david !
no !
no !
no !
no !
david !
no !
no !
david !
david !
dianne , no !
i'm coming , david !
david !
oh dear .
cocktails?
do it .
stay back !
shaun , hold them !
heads !
ed !
hurry up !
shauny , look who it is .
fuck a doodle doo !
ed !
shaun !
ed !
don't groan at me , you thick fuck !
i can't hold them !
no !
shaun !
pete !
i said leave him alone !
ed .
ed !
shaun , bar !
ed !
ed !
ed !
what?
chuck us a cloth , will you?
where are the shells?
they're on the bar .
oh , fuck .
ow !
fuck it !
what are we gonna do?
where are we gonna go?
the cellar .
maybe we can get out !
there's a hatch out on to the street .
you mean go back outside?
oh , give us a fucking break !
go !
i can see the street .
come on .
come on !
why won't it open?
that's it then , we're trapped .
hey , let's go to the winchester !
whose fucking idea was that?
man , i've really ballsed this up .
no , you haven't .
i have , liz .
i couldn't save us .
i couldn't save di or david .
i couldn't even save mum .
i'm useless .
you shouldn't feel so responsible , you tried .
you did something , that's what counts .
yeah , i suppose .
do you think they'll get through?
yeah .
how many shells have we got left?
erm ... two .
i suppose we could take a few of them out if they stand in a line .
i wasn't thinking about them .
i know .
what about ed?
there's only two shells .
i don't mind being eaten .
how are we gonna do this?
i don't know .
erm ...
one of us has to go first .
one should do the other and then do themselves .
you should do me .
i'll muck it up if i have to do myself .
i don't think i've got it in me to shoot my flatmate , my mum and my girlfriend all in the same evening .
what makes you think i've taken you back?
well ... you don't want to die single , do you?
actually ...
i would like to be shot .
besides , i've changed .
i haven't had a fag since yesterday , i promise .
he hasn't .
maybe we should have one now .
you left them in my flat .
yeah , in the bin .
i was desperate .
sneaky monkey .
sorry .
i won't say anything .
come on , we're getting out of here .
i mightjust stay here .
but we can get out .
you two should make a go of it .
what are you talking about?
i only hold you back .
yeah , but ...
maybe you should have this .
don't you want it?
no .
i can't hit anything with it anyway , i'm rubbish .
ed , i'm sorry .
what for?
cos i was shouting at you earlier on .
it's all right .
i'm sorry too .
it's ok .
no ...
i'm sorry , shaun .
oh , god !
that's not funny .
i'll stop doing 'em when you stop laughing .
i'm not laughing .
you'd better be off .
bye , ed .
love you .
cheers .
i love you too , man .
gay .
ready?
ready .
section one .
ready .
zombies to your front .
fire !
fire !
oh , my god !
shaun !
yvonne?
how are you doing?
