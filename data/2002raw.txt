who'll pinch me to wake me up?
who will laugh at me when i fall?
whose breath will i listen for ... ... so that i may sleep?
whose hand will i hold ... ... so that i may walk?
we may question ourselves at moments such as these .
did we make the right decision to settle here?
we are grateful for the time we have been given .
what manner of spectacle has attracted your attention so splendidly?
i ought to carry it in my pocket to help me teach .
who came upon this?
philip , did you move this?
no , mr. walker .
i inspected it carefully .
its head was twisted back and much of its fur removed .
i see .
it was murdered .
but who is the culprit?
who has done this heinous act?
those we don't speak of killed it .
there it is .
why would such a notion come into your mind?
they're meat eaters .
mmm .
they have large claws .
children ... ... those we don't speak of have not breached our borders for many years .
we do not go into their woods , they do not come into our valley .
it is a truce .
we do not threaten them .
why would they do this?
and we ought not to overlook the flight of the birds .
we didn't have it last year and i , for one , missed it desperately .
and i know your wife missed the children dressed in feathers and such .
i am fond of it .
mmm .
i do not have a say in this matter .
august nicholson is chair of today's meeting .
there's a young man who has requested a word with the elders .
well , do have him come forward .
alice .
hello , lucius .
my mother is unaware of the reason for my visit today .
she did not give her consent or consult me in any form .
the passing of little daniel nicholson from illness , and other events , have weighed on my thoughts .
i ask permission to cross into the forbidden woods and travel to the nearest town .
i will gather new medicines , and i will return .
with regards to those we don't speak of ,
i am certain they will let me pass .
creatures can sense emotion and fear .
they will see i am pure of intention , and not afraid .
the end .
what goes on in that head of yours?
say something , lucius .
finton coin is in the tower , and i've promised to sit with him .
hmm .
do you ever think of the towns , finton?
the towns?
what for?
they're wicked places where wicked people live .
that's all .
thank you , lucius .
you're a good friend .
i do hope no one saw you .
what we seem to have amongst us is a predator of some type , most likely a coyote or a wolf .
its manner of ... of killing and removing the fur , but leaving the flesh torn , may be a sign that this animal suffers from madness .
and for the next fortnight , we should be vigilant for sightings of this coyote .
keep careful watch over our little ones as they play on the hills .
as for the other notion ... ... we do not believe our boundary has been breached .
those we don't speak of are much larger creatures than coyotes ... ... and we would know if they had been here .
ahh , it's frightful , this business with the coyote .
is it not , papa?
do not feel worried , kitty .
you are not troubled?
i'm certain it will all end soon .
can we speak on other matters , then?
it would be a relief .
i'm in love !
i want your permission to marry , papa .
there's a proper manner in which things are supposed to happen .
such as the boy would normally be standing next to you , in a moment such as this ...
where is the boy in all this , kitty?
i haven't spoken to him as of yet .
the young man is unaware of your intentions?
he has a quiet way .
i was going to talk with him , papa , but not without your blessings .
i won't talk with him without your blessings .
kitty !
it's lucius hunt .
lucius?
you think badly of him?
no , no .
i have been thinking about him .
he's not like the other boys , papa .
he doesn't joke or bounce about .
no , he certainly does not .
do i have your blessings , then?
look , do me one favor first .
do not tell anyone else of your burstings until you have spoken with the young man .
good afternoon , lucius .
i wanted to ... to ... to tell you something .
i love you , lucius .
i love you ...
iike the day is long .
i love you more than the sun and the moon together .
and if you feel the same way , then we should not hide it any longer .
it's a gift , love is .
we should be thankful .
we should bellow it out with all the breath in our lungs .
thank you !
thank you !
thank you !
shh , shh .
shh .
# baby , sleep , gently sleep
# life is long and love is deep
# time will be sweet for thee
# all the world to see
# time to look about and know
# how the shadows come and go
# how the breeze stirs the trees
# how the blossoms grow
i often wondered if you and my son bonded because neither of you is fond of speaking .
you're very kind .
you must pardon my manners .
i haven't slept in many nights .
you are doing capital , jamison .
just a few more moments , huh?
gather your bravery .
do not jostle about so .
you'll ruin my shirt .
they made a sound when i made a sound , and they mimic before they attack .
have courage , man .
that's a wives 'tale .
it isn't true .
do not falter .
steel yourself !
you know , like a dog can smell you .
pardon me , mr. nicholson?
hmm .
you may run from sorrow , as we have .
sorrow will find you .
it can smell you .
hurry .
i didn't know you could run so fast .
we're still for running and staying ...
hey !
noah ought to be punished .
he whacked little joseph with a stick again .
ouch !
no more hitting !
put it down !
ow , ow , ow !
why don't they grab it?
noah percy !
stop your fussing right this moment .
you're in trouble , you know .
no hitting , no hitting .
i'm to place you in the quiet room .
um , i'll cry quarts .
what if we strike a deal?
yeah , capital idea .
it would be prudent to keep our deal a secret .
can you do that?
can i keep a secret?
like a church mouse .
you needn't go to the quiet room if you a take an oath to never strike any person again .
no hitting , no hitting .
no .
no hitting .
no hitting .
no hitting .
no hitting .
the deal is struck .
we ought not return right away , huh?
what shall we do with our stolen time?
hmm .
hmm .
hmm .
shall we have a foot race?
yes .
up the hill to the resting rock?
no cheating .
what a deeply scandalous thing to say .
i insist you take that back .
is that the school bell?
ivy , you cheated !
i know !
i'm sorry !
whoo !
my sister cried a lot .
you wonder how i recognized you?
some people just a handful , mind you give off the tiniest color .
it's faint , like a haze .
it's the only thing i ever see in the darkness .
papa has it , too .
do you wonder what your color is?
well , that i won't tell you .
it's not ladylike to speak of such things .
you shouldn't even have asked .
you run like a boy .
thank you .
i know why you denied my sister .
when i was younger ... ... you used to hold my arm when i walked .
then suddenly , you stopped .
one day , i even tripped in your presence , and nearly fell .
i was faking , of course , but still , you did not hold me .
sometimes we don't do things we want to do so that others won't know we want to do them .
what?
what's this?
oh , berries .
what a splendid present .
be cautious .
you are holding the bad color .
this color attracts those we don't speak of .
you must bury it .
you ought not to pick that color berry any more .
he picked it from his pocket .
what's wrong?
your breathing has changed .
i've never set eyes on these before .
you did not pick that now .
where did you find this?
today at resting rock ,
noah percy handed lvy walker berries of the bad color .
when asked where he found these berries , for they were not like others i have seen , he pointed to the drawing upon resting rock .
it is my belief that noah percy has entered the woods , and has done so on many occasions .
it is also my belief that , because of his innocence , those creatures who reside in the woods did not harm him .
this strengthens my feeling that they will let me pass if they sense i am not a threat .
we shall speak of the town , just this once , and we shall never speak of it again .
your father left for the market on a tuesday , at a quarter past nine in the morning .
he was found robbed and naked in the filthy river , two days later .
why'd you tell me this blackness?
so you will know the nature of what you desire .
i do not desire it .
my intentions are true to my word .
i think of nothing but the people of this village .
forgive me .
i am but scared for my only son's life .
i am not the one with secrets .
what is your meaning?
there are secrets in every corner of this village .
do you not feel it?
do you not see it?
that is for my own well being , so the evil things from my past are kept close and not forgotten .
forgetting would be to let them be born again in another form .
then let us open it .
no !
perhaps we should speak with edward walker together .
he may be able ...
he hides , too .
he hides his feelings for you .
oh .
sometimes we don't do things , yet others know we want to do things , so we don't do them .
what nonsense are you saying?
you needn't worry .
nothing will happen to me .
you remind me of a colt sometimes .
what makes you think he has feelings for me?
he never touches you .
there's no escape !
oh , hello .
i was just playing a game with noah .
the rascal must have gone to hide in my house again .
houses are against the rules !
he knows that .
are you all right?
we're tending to the children tonight , kitty and l .
i should be with her .
be well .
i heard my parents speaking of you .
i know of your request to go to the towns .
i think it is noble , but i do not think it is right .
are you not angry you have no sight?
i see the world , lucius hunt .
just not as you see it .
what of noah , then?
what if there are medicines for noah that could help him be still and to learn?
may we stop speaking of this?
it is putting knots in my stomach .
kitty is to be married .
she's found love , again , with christop crane .
you think it an odd choice , right?
you know , he won't sit back in his chair for fear of setting wrinkles on his shirts .
but he does have a gentlemanly way about him ... ... and he does care for my sister deeply .
i think kitty is blessed .
i am blessed as well .
my older sister is now spoken for .
i am now free to receive interest from anyone ... ... who might have interest .
i'm going to get you .
oh !
i got you .
i got you .
can you fetch a blanket for me?
have you seen noah?
lucius?
lucius?
hurry , to the cellar !
oh , good gracious !
they're coming .
they're coming .
close the door .
noah , close the door , ok?
they're coming .
close the door .
coming !
here we go .
noah , come on inside !
come on inside !
everyone , inside !
everyone , inside !
they're coming .
come on in .
let's close the door .
lucius is outside , walking .
they're coming .
he's inside safe somewhere !
please , close the door !
he'll come back to make sure we're safe .
ivy !
ivy , please .
please .
no .
don't let them in .
come on in .
by the markings we find this morning on our homes ... ... i feel they were warning us .
they acted as if threatened .
creatures have never attacked us without reason .
does anyone here know of a reason ... ... why these events may have occurred?
who has written this note?
please read so that all may hear .
i have brought this burden upon us .
on the day before last , i crossed the forbidden line
into covington woods ...
... and was witnessed there by those we don't speak of .
i am deeply sorry .
i have shamed myself and my family .
i pray that my actions will cause no further pains .
with deepest sorrow , lucius hunt .
is he in trouble?
do not fret .
you are fearless in a way that i shall never know .
we are grateful ... ... for the time we have been given .
yes .
yes , indeed .
cheers .
i had an elder sister .
mrs. clack , you've been keeping secrets .
oh , kitty reminds me of her so .
what manner of person was she?
saucy .
oh .
and we fought endlessly .
may i ask her name?
why did she not come to covington woods?
my sister did not live past her 23rd birthday .
a group of men took her life in an alley by our home .
please rise !
come on .
she's not going to squeeze my shirt like that , is she?
many blessings on this most joyous of days .
it was a rare and lovely ceremony , was it not?
glorious .
i saw your hand move to your eyes on more than one occasion .
that must have been dust of some matter .
mr. walker !
mr. walker !
mr. walker !
behind them .
how did she deal with this brightness?
help us out .
where are the rest of them?
speak up .
they're in the village .
what?
they left more warnings .
they wish us to leave .
that cannot be .
one saw us .
it ran off into the darkness .
you are certain?
can you boys stay close to lvy here?
she'll tell you some funny stories and have you laughing soon .
we will go together .
livestock has been taken and skinned .
the hides and feathers are missing .
there are marks on the door where it was opened .
the marks are high .
coyotes cannot reach that height .
the elders are going to have an inquiry tomorrow .
each member of the village is to be questioned in the meeting hall .
to see how the border was breached?
yes .
it is cold outside .
you ought to go in .
why are you on this porch?
it is not safe .
there are other porches .
do you find me too much of a tomboy?
i do long to do boy things ... ... iike that game the boys play at the stump .
they put their backs to the woods , and see how long they can wait before getting scared .
that's so exciting .
i understand you hold the record .
it will never be broken , they say .
it's just children's games .
how is it you are brave when all the rest of us shake in our boots?
i do not worry about what will happen , only what needs to be done .
how did you know i was here?
i saw you out the window .
no ... ... i won't tell you your color .
stop asking .
when we are married , will you dance with me?
i find dancing very agreeable .
why can you not say what is in your head?
why can you not stop saying what is in yours?
why must you lead , when i want to lead?
if i want to dance , i will ask you to dance .
if i want to speak , i will open my mouth and speak .
everyone is forever plaguing me to speak further .
why?
what good is it to tell you you are in my every thought from the time i wake?
what good can come from my saying l i sometimes cannot think clearly , or do my work properly?
what gain can rise from my telling you the only time i feel fear as others do ... ... is when i think of you in harm?
that is why i am on this porch , lvy walker .
i fear for your safety before all others .
and , yes ... ... i will dance with you on our wedding night .
i had been to the storage shed twice to fetch food prior to the wedding ceremony .
and the livestock was untouched at that time?
yes , mrs. hunt .
all was as it should be .
thank you , beatrice .
i beg your pardon .
is it true ... about lucius and lvy?
there are whispers all over the village .
we were informed early this morning of their intentions .
it is amazing to witness which two people love chooses to unite .
it follows no rules .
kitty ...
i wanted to speak with you first .
i would not want you to feel pain , in any fashion .
you are my cherished one .
if you were to feel badly about lucius , i would not have it .
one love to sacrifice another love is not right .
there is nothing you could do that would sacrifice my love for you .
you are my cherished one as well .
god bless you and your life together .
what's happened?
is this about lvy and myself?
i know you are very fond of her .
and i know she is fond of you .
there are different types of love .
oh .
oh , god .
oh , lvy ...
noah?
you'll be late for the meeting hall .
would you like your father to walk you there?
noah?
oh ...
the bad ...
the bad color .
oh ...
the bad color , the bad color ...
mama !
i beg your pardon .
what is it?
there's been an accident .
noah percy was found with quarts of blood upon his clothes and hands .
the blood was not his own , and he will not speak as to whose it is .
god in heaven .
ivy !
is there anyone injured in here?
has anyone been hurt in this home?
is anyone in here?
is anyone hurt in this house?
22 , 23 , 24 ...
31 , 32 , 33 ...
lucius?
lucius hunt !
you answer me right this moment !
is anyone hurt in this house?
they're fine .
mr. walker !
joseph !
papa ...
i cannot see his color .
ivy .
come away .
come away .
come away .
here , take her .
take her .
no !
he has suffered a great deal .
he may pass at any time .
please give him all your prayers and good thoughts .
he will hear them .
turn !
i am in love .
i know .
he is in love with me .
i know .
if he dies ... ... all that is life to me will die with him .
i ask permission ... ... to travel through covington woods ...
... and go to the towns ... ... to retrieve medicines ... ... that may save ... ... lucius hunt .
you are my father .
i will listen to you in all things .
i will trust your decision .
i've done what i can to close the wounds .
there's an infection .
what can be done to mend him?
we can only pray .
if there were no limitations , what could be done?
hmm?
what are you asking me?
is there anything at all that can be done to mend the boy?
please , victor .
would you be so kind as to answer my question?
if the infection is contained , he may still survive .
i must speak up .
you have a restless spirit .
i know the thing that is in your head .
you're thinking of going to the towns .
tell me i'm wrong .
you have made an oath , edward , as all have , never to go back .
it is a painful bargain , but no good can come without sacrifice .
these are your words i'm saying .
you cannot break the oath .
it is sacred .
it is a crime , what has happened to lucius .
you have taken the oath .
you and the rest of the elders ...
are you listening to me?
you ... ... have taken the oath .
the moment i heard my daughter's vision had finally failed her , and that she would forever be blind , i was sitting in that very chair .
i was so ashamed .
what do you know about your grandfather?
he was the wealthiest man in the towns?
that he was .
he had a gift for that .
if he was given one dollar , in less than a fortnight , he would have turned it into five .
you do not know of money .
it is not part of our life here .
money can be a wicked thing .
it can turn men's hearts black good men's hearts .
my father could not see this .
for all his gifts , he was a poor judge of a man's character .
your grandfather was a good man , lvy .
he had a laugh that could be heard three houses away .
he used to hold my hand as i hold yours .
he taught me strength and showed me love , and told me to lead when others would only follow .
your grandfather , james walker , died in his sleep .
a man put a gun to his head and shot him while he dreamed .
i tell you this so you will understand some of the reasons for my actions , and ... ... and the actions of others .
you are a strong one , lvy .
you lead when others would follow .
you see light when there is only darkness .
i trust you .
i trust you among all others .
thank you , father .
ivy , do you know where you are?
at the old shed that is not to be used .
yeah .
lvy .
yes , father?
do your very best not to scream .
what?
i am leaving to fetch you medicines .
i had a difficult time getting away .
what is it?
ivy ... ... has asked ... ... to go to the towns ... ... for medicines .
christop .
christop ... you needn't be scared .
we have the magic rocks .
they will keep us safe .
why have we not heard of these rocks before?
christop , please .
do not leave us .
there is nothing to fear .
then why do you wear the cloak of the safe color?
we will light torches .
it will be safe .
it is forbidden .
christop .
ivy ... there's something in these woods .
it turns my stomach to rot .
you will be safe .
they will not harm you , because you cannot see .
they will take pity on you , the way they took pity on noah when ... when he ventured in the woods .
they will kill me , lvy .
i cannot stay .
you're better in these woods than most boys .
anyone would say so .
it is my burden , finton .
you may go .
come with me .
do your very best not to scream .
there's an odd smell .
it is ahead of you .
what is it?
i cannot explain in words .
it is just a few steps .
those we don't speak of !
do not be frightened .
it is only farce .
do not be frightened .
there did exist rumors of creatures in these woods .
it is in one of the history books i used to teach in the towns .
the screams from the woods?
we created those sounds .
the ceremony of meat?
we remove it ourselves .
an elder is always assigned .
the drills they are farce , too?
we did not want anyone to go to the towns , lvy .
what about the animals the skinned ones?
are the elders responsible for that , too?
i believe one of the elders is responsible .
it will not happen again .
there is no one in this village who has not lost someone irreplaceable , who has not felt loss so deeply that they questioned the very merit of living at all .
it is a darkness i wished ... ... you would never know .
forgive us our silly lies , lvy .
they were not meant to harm .
i am ... sad for you , papa .
for all the elders .
on this paper has been written a tool of medicine .
it is common in the towns .
you will go ... with two escorts .
follow the sounds of the stream .
a half day's journey will bring you to a hidden road .
at this hidden road , the two escorts will wait as you continue .
you alone will follow the road ... ... and leave covington woods .
you are to tell no one in the towns where we are ... ... and return with haste .
i cannot come with you .
you gave your heart to this boy .
he is in need .
are you ready to take this burden , which , by right , is yours and yours alone?
i am making fresh cloths for lucius .
he needs them .
alice , i've sent for help .
i've sent lvy to the towns .
you cannot .
it is all that i can give you .
it is all that i can give you .
i accept .
what have you done?
he is the victim of a crime .
we have agreed never to go back .
never .
what was the purpose of our leaving?
let us not forget it was out of hope of something good and right .
you should not have made decisions without us .
you have gone too far .
i'm guilty , robert !
i made a decision of the heart .
i cannot look into another's eyes and see the same look i see in august's without justification !
it is too painful .
i cannot bear it !
you have jeopardized everything we've made .
who do you think will continue this place , this life?
do you plan to live forever?
it is in them that our future lies .
it is in lvy and lucius that this ... this way of life will continue .
yes , i have risked !
i hope i am always able to risk everything for the just and right cause .
if we did not make this decision , we could never again call ourselves innocent .
and that , in the end , is what we have protected here innocence !
that , i'm not ready to give up .
let her go .
if it ends , it ends .
we can move towards hope .
it's what's beautiful about this place .
we must not run from heartache .
you know , my brother was slain in the towns .
the rest of my family died here .
heartache is a part of life .
we know that now .
ivy's running toward hope .
let her run .
if this place is worthy , she'll be successful in her quest .
how could you have sent her?
she's blind .
she's more capable than most in this village ... ... and she is led by love .
the world moves for love .
it kneels before it in awe .
# all the world to see
# time to look about and know
# how the shadows come and go
# how the breeze stirs the trees
# how the blossoms grow
# sleep , baby , sleep
# sleep , gently sleep
there did exist rumors of creatures in these woods .
it is in one of the history books i used to teach in the towns .
it is not real .
it is not real .
noah?
oh , my god .
what is this?
what is this?
where is he?
he found one of the suits we kept under the floorboards .
oh , no .
oh , god .
the animals .
his will to live is very strong .
a half day's journey will bring you to a hidden road .
you alone will follow the road ... ... and leave covington woods .
you are to tell no one in the towns where we are ... ... and return with haste .
my sister did not live past her 23rd birthday .
a group of men raped and killed her .
they stuffed her in a dumpster ... three blocks from our apartment .
my brother worked in an emergency room downtown .
a drug addict came in with a wound to his ribs .
my brother tried to dress the wound .
he pulled a gun from his jacket ... ... then he shot my brother through his left eye .
my husband , michael ,
ieft for the supermarket at a quarter past nine in the morning .
he was found with no money and no clothes in the east river , three days later .
my father was shot by a business partner , who then hanged himself in my father's closet .
they had argued over money .
i am a professor .
i teach american history at the university of pennsylvania .
i have an idea ... ... that i would like to talk to you about .
mile 27 there's a girl .
i'm gonna check it out .
be careful .
you're not allowed to go in there .
please return to your vehicle .
what was that noise?
what are you doing out here?
how ... how'd you get here?
are you from the towns?
uh ...
where are you from?
the woods .
you came from the woods?
in there?
will you help me?
i need to find a doctor of medicine .
i must find these things .
we must make haste .
listen , ma'am .
i'm just supposed to ...
is someone hurt?
please , sir .
we must make haste .
well , you ... you live in there?
i do , sir .
breaker .
what is your name?
kevin .
kevin .
you have kindness in your voice .
i did not expect that .
we have guard shacks every ten miles around the perimeter of the preserve .
we keep medical supplies in there in case of animal bites or related injuries .
you can find the things written on the paper?
uh ...
you have to wait here .
please , sir .
please ... take this as payment .
wait , y you're not ...
you're not tricking me , are you?
i do not understand .
what's your name?
ivy .
ivy elizabeth walker .
there's an overturned tractor trailer causing a one hour delay at the lincoln tunnel .
the body of seven year old katrina nelson was found today .
she'd been missing for three days .
another 1 4 soldiers died in combat when a bomb exploded in their convoy .
it's 35 degrees outside .
what's with the girl?
i tried calling you back on the walkie .
you didn't answer .
oh , it was just some teenagers .
they were lost .
can i give you some advice?
don't get into conversations .
you start talkin ', you start gettin 'into how some estate is payin 'all of us , and no one's allowed to go in there and disturb the animal sanctuary .
people's interest gets piqued .
it's a really easy gig , kevin .
maintain and protect the border .
that's it .
a few years ago , it got out in the papers that some government guys had been paid off to keep plane routes from flying over this place .
that was a very stressful time for me .
don't cause me any troubles .
do not get into conversations .
hey , jay , where's the maintenance ladder?
i n need to fix a sign .
it's in the back .
ivy has returned with medicines from the towns .
she was attacked by a creature and killed it .
noah .
oh , god .
we will find him .
