tracy from the art department's husband .

i was just dropping off tracy's lunch , thought i'd say hello .

that's so sw
what are you doing?
what's wrong , pooky?
pooky "?
pukey .
you're married , and to a girl i work with .
well , that didn't stop us from rattling some desk drawers loose last week .
so come on .
lie down and take a memo .
listen , hire the best photographer , and i don't want jenna to find out .
no .
roger that .
okay?
god , what is up with her lately , anyway?
i mean , she seems so lost .
i have no idea .
i'm getting so sick of having her around ... ... with this crazy new act she has going on .
you know how she stole charlotte's idea and then fired her?
i say we go ahead with our own presentation ... ... and let her fall on her ass .
oh , god , yeah .
okay , you're not cajun .
wanna go for a walk?
sure .
i still can't believe you're getting married .
in two weeks .
is she your soul mate , wendy?
my soul mate?
i don't know if i believe in those .
i think that's kind of naive .
but you get goose bumps when you're around her ... ... and butterflies?
no , i haven't gotten crazy like that about a girl since high school .
matty .
what?
what happened to us?
i mean , how come we never stayed friends?
i don't know .
i forget .
no , what happened?
i don't know .
i can pretty much peg it to your 1 3th birthday party ... ... when you were playing that game .
spin the rapist?
seven minutes in heaven .
everybody ditched .
and that is the last thing i remember .
we don't have to get into this .
it's a long time ago .
it really doesn't matter anymore .
it matters to me .
just tell me .
you came out of the closet ... ... and i started to sing my birthday song to you .
and then you picked up and threw at me ... ... with impressive force , i might add ... ... the dream house that i spent three weeks building for you .
and then you just stopped being my friend ... ... and you never spoke to me again after that , ever .
i'm so sorry .
forget it , jenna .
it was a long time ago .
it doesn't matter .
matt , stop being so nice to me .
i don't deserve it .
do you know what kind of person i am now?
do you know who i am right now?
i ....
i don't have any real friends .
i ....
i did something bad with a married guy .
i don't talk to my mom and dad .
i'm not a nice person .
and the thing is ... ...
i'm not 13 anymore .
jenna .
behind you .
oh , it's good to be home .
daddy .
jenna?
what in the world?
sweetheart .
i missed you guys so much .
are you all right?
mom .
do you ever wish you could go back ... ... like to another time?
i wouldn't mind giving back some of these wrinkles .
okay .
if you were given one do over , anything in your life , what would it be?
nothing .
really?
really .
but did you ever make a big mistake?
or a huge one that could change your life?
what about that?
well , jenna , i know i made a lot of mistakes ... ... but i don't regret making any of them .
how come?
because if i hadn't have made them ... ...
i wouldn't have learned how to make things right .
i'm sorry i missed last christmas .
carrie , i'm heading out , okay?
i'm so exhausted .
jenna's working late .
she has been .
hey .
hey .
i was gonna stop by your office .
i tried to call you a bunch of times .
i didn't get any messages .
i was in a hurry .
but i did try to reach you .
i actually wanted to talk to you about this whole redesign thing .
i hope you don't mind , but i've been working on something on my own .
it's really last minute .
i hope you don't mind .
no , of course not ... ... because i'm doing the same thing .

i could really use this , but you don't need to do me any favors .
i'm asking you to do me a favor .

... they're both a candy and a gum .
that's incredible .
i can't believe they had them .

hey .
yeah?
you got arm hair .
it's never quite got that reaction before .
it was like it wasn't even me .
like i had just ... ... watched us down below , kissing .
then i just floated home on a cloud .
that is so romantic .
look .
you've got goose bumps .
i totally know .
they won't go away .
do you love him?
duh .
when will you see him again?
i don't know , actually .
i don't know if i can .
what?
why?
it's complicated .
it's a grownup thing .
well , at least you have someone to dream about .
guys don't wanna jump your bones when you're a metal mouth .
what is that attitude?
we are young .
heartache to heartache , we stand .
love is a battlefield .
but i like it like this , with freckle girl and the dog .
these photos are unbelievable , jen .
okay , here's the dog .
francis is the dog's name .
okay .
what do you think?
well , i think i'm gonna start reading " poise " for the first time in my life .
no , i got a place i rent in brooklyn .
that'll work?
all right , i'll see you then .
bye bye .
hey .
i wasn't expecting to see you
wendy .
i thought you were flying in tomorrow .
what , are you expecting someone else?
no .
hi .
i wanna take you to lunch .
hungry?
yeah , yeah .
what a surprise .
okay , where do you ...?
how was your flight?
it was good .
you can take pictures of vitamin bottles anywhere .
and i was just thinking that we should try to resolve this now .
instead of being a commuter couple during our first year of marriage .
what?
i'm sorry , i'm sorry .
could you ...?
i missed that .
arlene , do you have any more?
jenna .
my balls , excuse my french , are in an iron vice .
corporate are twisting like a bunch of dominatrixes on steroids .
now lucy's presenting her own redesign .
tell me what's going on .
what is going on is you will have more choices .
all respect to lucy , i'm more anxious to know what you're working on .
thank you .
i'm not complimenting you ... ...
i'm trying to pressure you .
how long until your balls get totally squished?
hopefully never .
i'm really rather attached to my balls .
can they hang in there till 5?
jenna , you are not yourself at the moment .
since when do you keep me out of the loop?
i'm really freaking out here .
the rest of the prints are ready .
goody .
hang in there .
why does nobody listen to a word i say?
arlene , aren't you coming?
oh , you're invited , are you?
okay , bye bye .
oh , no , excuse me .

i'm just the ... ... editor in chief .
whatever .
we've gotta go to 23rd , please , between 5th and 6th .
it's 29 west 23rd .
you got it , lady .
the new and improved " poise " will explore the last frontier .
the new and improved " poise " will explore the last frontier .
it will go heroin chic one better .
it will od .
it will kill .
cause of death?
chicness .
the new " poise " will go farther than any fashion magazine ever before .
it will be deadly serious .
fashion suicide .
so , what do you think?
thank you , sir .
how much time do we have?
we have two minutes .
hurry .
jeez .
such a bitch .
i know this is different .
i mean , from anything we've ever done .
and i know you might hate it and think i'm completely crazy .
but i won't care , even if i get fired .
and i don't mean that disrespectfully , it's just that i've realized something .
who are these women?
does anyone know?
i don't recognize any of them .
i wanna see ... ... my best friend's big sister ... ... and the girls from the soccer team .
my next door neighbor .
real women who are smart and pretty and happy to be who they are .
these are the women to look up to .
let's put life back into the magazine .
and fun and laughter and silliness .
i think we all i think all of us wanna feel something ... ... that we've forgotten or turned our backs on .
because maybe we didn't realize how much we were leaving behind .
we need to remember what used to be good .
if we don't ... ... we won't recognize it even if it hits us between the eyes .
i just ....
bravo !
brilliant .
we will present this to corporate first thing tomorrow morning .
so who's this mystery photographer?
matt flamhaff .
is he arthur or martha?
matt .
he's matt .
no , no .
is he gay?
are you gay?
city and listing?
manhattan .
sparkle " magazine on park avenue .
sparkle magazine .
trish sackett , please .
jenna , i'm sorry to barge in on you like this , but i really have to talk to you
hey , beaver .
i mean matt .
i'm sorry .
old habits die hard , you know .
fine .
is jenna around?
are you here about your photos?
no , actually , i'm not .
i guess i should just tell you ... ... that jenna's decided to go in a different direction ... ... with a more established photographer .
she's gonna use the guy who shoots the official photos of her sweetie pie .
so don't take it personally , because there's just a little bias .
i'm sorry to be so honest with you , because ... ...
i think your pictures are really cute .
it was nice talking to you .
hey , matt .
while i've got you here , do you wanna sign a general release?
maybe we can use your pictures in a catalog .
fine .
hi .
jenny , right?
jenna .
i was looking for matt .
i wanted to tell him some really great news about his photographs .
everybody loved them .
that's great .
i'll tell him when he gets back .
he's out getting his tux .
his tux?
i know .
men .
everything's the last minute .
i mean , hello .
we're getting married tomorrow .
this'll be the cutest little backyard wedding since i don't know when .
congratulations .
thanks .
i'll tell matt you stopped by .
okay .
bye .
we wanna feel something again that we've forgotten .
because we didn't stop to notice how much we were leaving behind .
we need to remember what used to be good .
you ready?
the meeting's cancelled , jenna .
what , until tomorrow?
it's over .
it's over?
lucy ....
she took all your designs to " sparkle " .
everything .
she's their new editor in chief .
your photos showed up in " sparkle online " last night .
they're in outdoor ads everywhere .
she can't take matt's pictures .
those belong to us .
she can't do it !
she can , and she is .
she got him to sign this .
lucy , you stole matt's pictures .
oh , which one do you wanna be today , the pot or the kettle?
if you don't mind , i'd like to be the pot .
maybe the kettle .
it doesn't really matter .
they're both black .
what are you talking about?
i found this in your office yesterday .
does it look familiar?
it has your name on it .
you went through my things?
oh , give me a break .
how horrible .
how terrible .
i can't believe i did it .
what is this?
you can wipe off the " bambi watching her mother get shot ... ... and strapped to the back of a van " look from your face .
i talked to trish sackett yesterday .
it's okay , jenna .
i know all about your little deal .
it's a sweet little deal , actually .
editor in chief if you help them hit a million copies?
so you'd give them tips .
oh , my god .
not bad .
i just wish i would have thought of it .
oh , no .
oh , yes .
only , now i'm taking your job , you stay here with the magazine ... ... you single handedly flushed down the toilet .
what about matt?
why did he sign this?
what did you say to him?
let's see .
i think that i told him ... ... you had decided to go in a different direction .
which you are now .
i might have told him something else , too , but i just can't remember .
george washington bridge , new jersey .
jenna .
jenna rink .
yeah?
chris grandy .
so , what are you doing?
are you married?
because if you're single , i definitely want a number .
we could get together .
i'm still living at home
come on , grandy !
come on .
holy christ !
this is the tune we first tangled tongues to .
what's the dude who sings this?
rick springsteen .
it's springfield , grandy .
i'm out of here .
i thought you wanted my number .
i'll take these .
good afternoon .
you remember , wayne .
it was with the flamhaffs at san ysidro ranch .
san ysidro ranch .
it's so pretty .
it's perfect .
it looks great .
hi .
hey .
i don't know what lucy said to you about me , but i want you to know ... ... that whoever that was she was talking about ... ... wasn't me .
it doesn't matter what lucy said .
i stopped trusting her after she stole my pop rocks in the third grade .
matt .
i am not the awful person that i know that i was .
i don't even know that person .
and i'd like to believe ....
i have to believe that if you knew that ... ... if in your heart , you really , really knew that ... ... you wouldn't be getting ready to marry someone now .
unless that someone were me .
jenna , i'm not gonna lie to you .
i have felt things ... ... these past few weeks ... ... that i didn't know i could feel anymore .
but i have realized in these past few days ... ... you can't just turn back time .
why not?
i moved on .
you moved on .
we've gone down different paths for so long .
we made choices .
i chose wendy .
that's her family down there .
we care about each other , you know?
you don't always get the dream house , but you get awfully close .
please don't cry , jenna .
oh , i'll be fine , i promise .
matty , can i have it?
please?
you're not gonna whip it at me?
no .
look , i won't have you be late .
just go .
go on .
i'm fine .
i'm just crying because i'm happy .
i want you to be so , so happy .
i love you , matt .
you're my best friend .
jenna , i ....
i've always loved you .
jenna's waiting for you in the closet .
matty .
you really know what you're doing .
come on .
sorry , i forgot my scarf .
you know what?
you can be the pot and kettle all by yourself from now on , biatch .
come on , matt .
what did you call me?
we're gonna be late .
for what?
you'll see .
a razzle , mr. flamhaff?
thank you , mrs. flamhaff .
