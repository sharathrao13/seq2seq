boxers !
not one step further .
the keeper of the imperial seal .
just the man i was looking for .
a woman .
you chinese are very progressive .
a gift from an old friend .
wu chow .
he wanted me to send his regards .
father !
father .
the seal .
you must get it back .
i promise .
give this ... to your brother .
what are you reading?
oh . roy o bannon vs. the mummy .
it s incredible .
roy s just taken out the mummy s entire army of zombie confederate soldiers , and he only had one bullet .
that s impossible .
oh , no , it s not .
roy figured out the physics of the canyon and then ricocheted a bullet off the canyon wall .
nailed each zombie through the heart .
what about the shanghai kid?
he was captured and knocked out on page 10 while he was polishing roy s pearl handles .
don t you worry .
roy s about to save him from becoming a human sacrifice .
those stories are all lies .
no .
see?
it says right here on the back . author sage mccallister bases all his stories on firsthand accounts .
sorry , sheriff .
no princess .
every day you meet the noon stage .
every day it s the same story .
she s not coming back .
pei pei s married to her work in san francisco .
modern woman .
sheriff , you got a parcel .
hey , maybe it s from her !
no .
it s from my sister in china .
i know .
i know .
i must go .
stay here and be a good horsey for the new sheriff .
uh , sheriff , that stage is headed east .
isn t china kind of west of here?
i m not going to china .
i m going to new york .
roy invested my money .
is it true that he lives in a penthouse at the top of the ritz surrounded by dozens of beautiful women at his every beck and call?
that s the old roy .
he s married , settled down .
trust me , he s changed .
so there we were .
completely outnumbered .
he didn t have to tell me we didn t stand a chance .
so i send the shanghai kid and the princess out the back .
poor shanghai kid .
he was so frightened .
he forgot to thank me for saving his life .
i m used to that .
now , i returned to the front , and i counted to three ... and i burst out of the mission .
pearl handles blazing .
lead flying everywhere .
and not a single bullet touched me .
no !
yeah .
what happened to the emperor s gold?
well , we divided it up .
i insisted on giving my share to the indians .
the savages?
please don t ever call those noble people savages .
if being proud of your body and wanting to ride around naked all day makes you a savage , then , by god , you re drinking with a savage .
and that is what you call a french toast .
you are so sophisticated , mr. o bannon .
whoo !
who s up for some more bubbly?
reach for the sky , roy .
say that again .
reach for the sky , roy .
chon wang !
you sly son of a gun !
look at you !
look at you !
what brings you to new york?
my share of the gold .
refresh my memory .
what gold?
the emperor s gold .
okay , now , that gold is in what the wall street pros call a long term investment .
we can t touch it because it s building .
i need it tonight .
you just got here .
let s celebrate .
no .
i don t have time .
you just got to the big city .
my father s been killed .
chon , i m ...
you need the money to get back for the funeral?
no .
i must go to england .
the ship leaves tonight .
your father died in england?
china .
my sister followed the murderer to london .
wait .
murderer .
i m a little bit mixed up .
let me see if i can get the facts straight .
you have a sister?
you never told me you had a sister .
is she pretty or does she look like you?
be honest .
roy , i need my money !
i don t like that tone of voice .
you think after all we ve been through i d stiff you?
i m doing pretty well for myself .
yeah .
i m sorry , roy .
that s okay .
you re going through a really tough time right now .
you got to be more trusting of people , okay?
look at me .
it s roy .
the couple at table 5 is ready to order .
do you work here?
no , i don t work here .
it looks like these guys are wearing a similar jacket .
roy , here s your cut of the tips .
it s the craziest thing .
i guess because i come in here so much they re mistaking me for a waiter .
it s embarrassing .
you lost the gold .
not all of it .
where s the rest?
i have one word for you .
zeppelin .
i need my money now !
easy , easy .
will you do anything for this money?
yes .
i must leave tonight .
okay .
take this key .
go to the room .
get cleaned up .
your old pal roy s got a plan .
go !
come on !
howdy , big boy .
what?
there s a woman in there !
she wants me to sleep with her .
of course she does .
i told her the great wall ain t the only big thing coming out of china .
why did you say that?
so you could get the money .
i will not sleep with women for money !
why?
i m gonna sleep with her for money .
chon , just go in there and do your business and think about your sister in england .
what?
roy !
duty calls .
roy !
good evening , mr. mayor .
where are they?
who?
my daughters .
1 0th floor .
roy?
roy , you got trouble .
roy !
i got to check on something .
i il be right back .
chon , new plan .
we got to go .
chon , what are you doing? !
i m fixing her back .
put her down , you decadent philistine .
hey , chon , come on !
let s go !
bye bye .
bye .
come on !
i don t understand .
what s going on?
i don t have time to explain .
all you have to know is there are bad men after us ... but i m in the right .
roy .
you gotta trust me on this .
okay , look .
i m in a transitional phase in my life .
but ...
but what?
you want to know the truth?
i m a little lost right now .
i see you .
you ve got a sense of purpose .
but look at me .
i m a 30 year old waiter/ gigolo .
where s the future in that?
so what s the plan?
you were always my compass , chon .
the plan .
you ask me the right questions .
the plan?
the plan , i think , is to find the right woman .
raise a lot of children and teach them values .
no , roy .
the plan to get out of here .
okay , the plan .
here we go .
cops !
cops !
they can help us .
no , no .
chon , not these cops .
these are dirty cops .
they take advantage of people .
now , if they stop us , remember , i m not roy o bannon .
who are you?
i m your friend smoky desperado from the west .
and who am l?
you .
you re benihana .
benihana .
yeah .
you teach crippled children yoga here in the city .
you go first .
no !
why me?
because you blend in , okay?
now , go !
don t let them see you !
benihana .
hey !
hey !
ooh .
psst !
chon !
come on .
stop wasting time .
you !
chon , i found our ticket out of here .
we re on our way .
looks like old roy came through again .
just like old times , chon .
check over there !
over to the alley !
that way !
yeah , just like old times .
will you forget about the gold for a second?
you re gonna have more money than you ever dreamed of when that first zeppelin takes off .
why do i always believe you?
what do you mean?
you re lucky i didn t invest in that ridiculous automobile idea .
yeah , that s gonna make a lot of money .
what s that?
doghouse .
i m in the doghouse .
oh , come on , chon .
look , i m sorry i lied .
i just didn t want to disappoint you .
that s exactly what i mean .
i can t take that look .
i learned it from my father .
that s how he used to look at me .
what did your dad do?
was he an imperial guard?
no .
much more important .
he was the keeper of the imperial seal .
that s what i love about china .
everybody s job description sounds so damn cool .
the seal has been symbol of the emperor s power since genghis khan .
it has been passed down from one emperor to another .
my family have been watching over it for 1 2 generations .
1 2 generations?
my father and i used to skip stones across the moat and talk about a day i would follow his footsteps .
i was his only son .
if i d have been there , i could have protected him .
it s not your fault .
you were 3, 000 miles away .
what s with that little box?
my sister sent it to me from my father .
there s a message inside .
what s it say?
it s a puzzle box .
i don t know how to open yet .
what do you mean?
get a hammer and smash it open so you can see what it says .
i must have patience .
by the time i m able to open it ...
i will be ready to read the message .
come on , confucius .
that s the corniest thing i ve ever heard .
let me see this .
you know what?
we re gonna go to england .
we re gonna find your dad s killer .
we re gonna get that seal back .
there s no reward for this , roy .
who said anything about a reward?
i m talking about friendship , loyalty , honor .
okay?
thank you , roy .
and i hear england is ass soup .
a lot of pretty girls there .
first order of business , my lords ... is a report from our esteemed friend lord rathbone ... who recently returned from a diplomatic mission to china .
fellow lords ...
i m afraid i bring disturbing news from the orient .
the opium wars have ravaged the land .
the emperor s enemies are organizing .
the most vicious are the boxers .
a godless band of rebels who murder without discretion .
china is not well .
i have brought back an envoy who should give us some insight into the inscrutable mind of the chinese .
is he mad?
given to her majesty queen victoria by the emperor in recognition of her 50 glorious years on the throne .
outrageousness !
long live the queen .
england swings like a pendulum do
bobbies on bicycles , two by two
westminster abbey , the tower of big ben
the rosy red cheeks of the little children
jack the ripper strikes again !
extra !
extra !
read all about it .
howdy , partner .
the english are not very friendly .
they re just sore losers .
what did they lose?
a little thing called the american revolution , chon .
never heard of it .
i il give you the highlights .
they came over with about a million men .
we had a bunch of farmers with pitchforks and beat em like a drum .
hey !
i m walking here !
you re driving on the wrong side of the road !
bunch of amateurs .
these people don t get it .
hello , ladies .
look at you .
what?
i m not supposed to notice a pretty lady?
i thought you wanted to settle down and have a family .
i do , chon .
i just hope i can .
why not?
sometimes i worry that all the damn horseback riding
i did out in the west , bouncing up and down on the hard saddles might have made it so my salmon don t swim upstream the way they re supposed to .
what?
i might be shooting blanks .
oh .
don t say anything .
roy , it s okay .
some people are not meant to have a family .
i ve always had such a special connection with children .
the little ankle biters .
hey , watch it , you little punk !
pardon me , guv .
you gents lost your way?
yeah .
we re looking for my sister .
she s staying at 32 oxford street .
i know it well , guv .
me old man used to live there .
can you show us the way?
well , memory s a little dodgy .
but i m sure for a bob i could get you there .
what do you take us for?
okies from muskogee?
go sell your bullshit someplace else .
we re not buying .
thanks for the tip , guv .
hey !
i stole that watch from my uncle !
what?
this way .
come here , you little rubbish eater !
what did i tell you about poaching on our turf , charlie?
i m on the straight and narrow .
honest .
what s this , then?
after i m through beating you ... you re gonna wish you never ran away from the workhouse !
leave the boy alone .
bloody tourists !
get your noses out of it !
do whatever you want to the kid ... but that s my watch .
well , there s a load of us and only two of you .
so piss off !
easy , fellas .
you ve lost one war this way .
don t make the same mistake twice .
come on !
after him !
hey !
there he is !
get him !
we ve got him now .
move in , lads .
boys , boys , wait , wait !
come on !
get him !
up the bloody ladder !
hey !
hey !
oh !
watch it !
hey .
ah !
come here , you !
cool .
move it !
you !
did you see that?
it s okay .
okay? !
i call that one my kung pao chicken .
i clotheslined the sucker .
come on , get back !
clear away !
make way !
i think you gentlemen should accompany me back to the yard .
this isn t a yard !
it s a jail !
roy , calm down .
unbelievable .
wait !
someone s coming !
let me handle this .
i m gonna handle it .
the english aren t like you .
they don t get all emotional .
touchy feely .
do me a favor .
park the kung fu .
let me do the talking .
come here .
let me give you a hug .
ooh !
i ve been after that fleet street gang for two years .
then you two come along and bring them down in a single afternoon .
brilliant !
now , um ...
oh , that s my watch !
yes .
a street urchin turned it in .
the little punk better not have scuffed it .
i hope your luck picks up .
what do you mean?
i deduced from your watch that you d hit a rough patch .
he has .
how do you know?
it s an investigative technique i ve developed .
i can deduce intimate details about an individual through a close scrutiny of their personal effects .
what else can you tell?
the owner of this watch is a bad gambler and a lousy shot .
although he s cheated death several times ... he spends most of his life wandering in a rather pathetic and futile search for purpose and respect .
oh , yes .
he has a penchant for loose women .
wow .
that s amazing .
i m sure it s a very popular party trick at birthdays for small children ... but it doesn t quite play with adults .
just to set the record straight .
roy o bannon is not attracted to loose women .
loose women are attracted to me .
you re roy o bannon?
yeah .
the famous western folk hero?
have you heard of me?
have i heard of you?
i ve only read roy o bannon vs. the mummy five times .
it s fascinating .
i want you to meet the shanghai kid .
oh , yes .
the faithful chinese sidekick .
i m not a sidekick .
those stories are all lies .
come on , don t be bitter .
i can t help what sage mccallister writes .
if there s anything i can do , i m at your service .
we re looking for my sister .
she s staying at this address .
can you take us there?
oh , dear .
i think you d better come with me .
lin .
wang .
if you don t mind , i il just wait outside .
introduce me .
oh .
this is lin , my baby sister .
roy o bannon .
pleasure .
you never told me your sister was such a ... beautiful lotus blossom .
what d she say?
no , no , no .
no talking about me in your native tongue .
why are you in jail?
i followed the man who murdered father .
and?
i found out where he live .
i snuck inside his house and tried to kill him .
it s my duty to find father s killer .
no , it is mine !
i m the one who promised father .
but i m his only son .
when you abandoned us for america ...
father said he had no son .
what?
whoa .
time out .
time out .
come here .
the detective s a fan .
why don t i play the celebrity card?
we il get her out that way .
okay?
okay .
don t worry .
i il get you out .
everything s gonna be okay .
in fact , i m gonna give you my good luck playing cards .
just ignore the naked ladies .
wang !
have you opened father s box?
not yet .
she tried to assassinate lord rathbone whilst he was taking afternoon tea .
he s 1 0th in line to the throne ...
her majesty s favorite cousin ... and the finest swordsman in england .
so , of course , the press had a field day .
the story actually knocked jack the ripper off the front page .
artie , lin is not a killer .
she s just a really , really , really hot ... confused chinese girl .
maybe if i agreed to sign a few autographs and talk to some of my fans here in england ... do some type of charity event , can we get her out that way?
i m afraid that s out of the question .
what will happen to my sister?
she il go to trial , probably be locked away in an institution for the criminally insane .
the tabloids have already dubbed her loony lin .
i thought it was rather catchy .
at the time .
do you have any notion what would happen if we were to be seen together?
since your return , i have yet to lay eyes on the imperial seal .
i m hosting a jubilee ball at my country estate tomorrow .
be at the stables at midnight .
as requested , a token of my esteem .
this is where you get out .
i hope there will be more trust between us when i m emperor and you are the new king .
wow .
buckingham palace .
look at that , chon .
that s where the queen lives .
hey , look at this guy .
he s a royal guard .
he has a very important job .
i used to be just like him .
no , they re nothing like you .
they re a tourist attraction .
you can make faces at them , insult them ... and they can t move a muscle .
here .
watch this .
roy ...
no , it s okay .
hey , buddy , your shoes are untied .
that is the biggest damn beaver i have ever seen .
roy , stop it .
the queen !
look !
the queen !
she s mooning us !
he almost went for that .
my friend and i just came over from america .
you might have heard of it .
we run your jerkwater country .
come on , you gonna take that from a colonial?
roy , stop it .
i bet you are one hell of a damn poker player .
no hard feelings .
huh?
they can t do that !
you re not allowed to do that !
shouldn t have touched him .
you scram , you little punk .
i ve got friends at scotland yard .
i il give you up in a heartbeat .
you get your watch back?
don t worry about my watch .
go on .
it s a knockoff .
what are you talking about?
my uncle stole this watch from president lincoln .
it s a priceless family heirloom .
not according to the pawnbroker .
you should not steal .
if i don t steal , i don t eat .
who showed you how to do all that kicking and punching?
my father .
have you ever heard of those?
they re parents .
you don t cause you re a little orphan .
now , go on .
you re cramping our style .
oh , this country blows .
you need a place to stay?
come on in and warm your dogs .
you can get into a lot of trouble breaking into a place like this .
that being said , well done .
you just ate the last chocolate .
course i did .
you gotta look out for number one .
i could really get used to this .
living the life of a country gentleman .
maybe doing a little painting .
let lin play in the garden with the children .
vera , chuck , and dave .
who s lin?
lin s the most beautiful woman i ve ever met .
she s gonna be the savior of the house of o bannon .
chon , check out the threads .
all i m missing is the loyal hound curled at my feet .
we are wasting time .
we must find rathbone .
what do you think i ve been doing?
sitting here drinking expensive hooch?
refill .
i ve been working on a plan .
now whoa .
don t slosh the brandy .
it messes with the bouquet .
sod off .
i m trying to teach you a skill set .
help get you off the street .
bartenders make big bucks .
roy !
the plan .
thank you , chon .
if we find the seal ... we can prove rathbone killed your dad .
it s the old hail mary play .
i also have a version where we dig a tunnel .
hey !
bloody catapult .
jesus christ !
you don t need a catapult !
who asked you?
you don t interrupt grown ups when they re talking . lord nelson rathbone requests the pleasure of your company at the jubilee ball in honor of her majesty s 50th year on the throne .
sounds good .
it doesn t address security .
they re not gonna let chon and i waltz into the castle .
all you need is a proper disguise .
i do like a good disguise .
i look like a fool .
what? !
you re a maharaja .
that s indian royalty .
but i m chinese .
it s the same thing .
bob your head a little bit .
gives you more of a india royalty flavor .
that s good .
good show , good show .
good show , good show .
cheerio , cheerio .
cheerio , cheerio .
what do we do when we see rathbone?
kill him .
no , okay?
no !
you re gonna be civil , cause we don t have the seal .
no seal .
no lin .
no family honor .
okay?
be cool .
okay , we look great .
let s enjoy this party .
whoa .
what are you doing?
i m going inside .
the place is haunted .
you re the harness man .
you get back at the carriage .
you wait in case we need to make a quick getaway .
go on .
man your post .
you don t always get what you want .
why are you so mean to that boy?
i see a lot of myself in that kid .
it s kind of freaking me out .
come on .
your name , please , sir .
so i can announce you .
sherlock ... holmes .
sherlock holmes .
which province do you represent , your highness?
nevada .
may i present major general sherlock holmes and his highness , the maharaja of nevada .
how are the security arrangements?
oh , everything seems to be going swimmingly , my lord .
and if i may say so ... it is an honor to guard your lordship tonight .
i speak for all of us at scotland yard when i say that no matter how far you are from the throne ... you il always be number one in our hearts .
okay , here s the plan .
we re gonna get a little chow .
then we re gonna sneak out of here .
start looking for that seal .
okay .
spotted dick , sir?
what?
spotted dick .
can you believe this guy?
i m trying to get something to eat .
he s asking me if i got the clap .
i think he s offering you food .
oh .
spotted dick .
oh , no .
i think i il pass .
i m not really a dessert man .
perhaps my friend might like some spotted dick .
i might try one of these sausages .
a little smoky joe .
mmm !
this is good !
i thought the food here was supposed to suck .
the haggis is fresh from scotland , sir .
it s made from the finest sheeps bladders .
i m gonna get some whiskey and wash my mouth out .
you should try the quail .
i shot them myself this morning .
how do you do , your lordship?
very well , thank you .
i m not acquainted with the nevada province .
but i haven t been to india since 81 .
i spent most of my time in the orient .
i hear you ve just returned from china .
you are well informed , maharaja .
it is my dream that the chinese people will follow india s example and one day embrace british rule .
the chinese are very proud .
they place family and honor above all else .
well , i m sure we can break them of that .
if you il excuse me , i have a matter to attend to .
until we meet again .
patience .
i m proud of you , chon .
we must find the seal .
what do you see?
shh , shh , shh !
he just pulled a fancy dragon key out of his desk .
that was my father s !
i must avenge his honor .
hey , slow down , tiger .
slow down .
quit going all chinese on me .
where is he?
damn it .
remember your puzzle box .
patience .
okay , there are no windows .
we just came in through the only doorway .
that leaves one explanation .
remember in roy o bannon vs. the mummy how the zombie king got away when i chased him into the pharaoh s tomb?
there s a secret passageway behind the sphinx .
there s gotta be a lever or a button over here .
help me lift some stuff up .
roy !
the painting .
it s looking at me .
look !
oh , yeah .
looks like it s looking at me .
that s great .
no , real eyes .
moving !
that kid got to you , didn t he?
unbelievable !
we re not in a haunted house .
that s a technique that an artist uses . ubiquitous gaze or pursuant eyes is the technical term .
it s unnerving , though .
i il give you that .
roy .
now , those eyes .
look !
whatever you say , chon .
let s see what you got here , rathbone .
roy !
what , chon?
are the statues moving now?
wow .
mm mmm !
roy !
i can t hear myself think with you shouting at me .
chon?
chon?
chon?
this is ridiculous .
if you want to act like a child and play games ... then find someone else ... cause i take this stuff seriously .
i m here to work .
i m on a mission .
chon?
okay , chon .
okay , you little chinese otter .
let s play .
ha !
chon , demons !
she s gonna fight my battles for me .
come on .
let s go .
what?
what are you doing?
it s kinky .
i like it .
wow !
look at this .
wait .
there s something different about this room .
hey .
let s go !
wang !
chon , for god s sakes .
now he shows up .
i found it .
wait .
do you want to hear?
the seal s gone .
lin .
roy !
are we gonna come back?
roy !
must you keep doing that?
i was taught not to be seen or heard .
the seal .
i am a man of my word .
i remember watching my brother play with this
like a baby rattle .
when i d try to touch it , the dowager empress beat me .
no doubt your deprived childhood made you into the man you are today .
wu chow .
wu who?
he is the emperor s bastard brother .
he was banished from the forbidden city for trying to steal the imperial seal .
our father caught him .
he vowed to return to claim the emperor s throne .
this guy?
i il assume everything has been arranged as discussed .
you have nothing to worry about .
it s all in place .
that diamond is as big as a damn monkey s paw .
look at that .
roy .
don t even think about it .
i m just admiring the craftsmanship , chon .
so for now , our business is completed .
where s lin? !
hey !
hey !
gotcha !
just looking out for number one .
no !
the kid got the seal !
chon !
it s stuck .
lin !
go !
you can do it !
she s got it .
she s got it !
roy !
come on !
chon , what in our history together makes you think i m capable of something like that?
roy !
i can t do that !
hurry up !
wait .
there s a better way .
every day i get in the queue
too much , magic bus
to get on the bus that takes me to you
slow down !
i m a bat out of hell !
yee haw !
besides , i don t know where the brake is .
what? !
look out !
now i ve got my magic bus
now i've got my magic bus
so , what now , buddy?
relax , relax .
smooth sailing from here .
yes , these are the men who attacked me .
i m afraid the assailants have temporarily eluded us , my lord .
perhaps you could explain to me how loony lin managed to escape from the confines of scotland yard under the watch of the most respected police force in the world .
yes , of course .
it s absolutely fascinating .
she picked the lock using a deck of rather risque playing cards .
then scaled the walls with a mop , a fork ... and various pilfered undergarments .
you ve got to hand it to the chinese .
they re awfully ingenious , lord , aren t they?
does your incompetence know no bounds? !
it's the time of the season
when love runs high
in this time , give it to me easy
and let me try with pleasured hands
where am i?
lin !
i don t even know these women .
lin , what are you doing here?
oh , lord .
do you want to try the position on page 37?
come here , you little minx .
what?
you okay?

he has a good heart .
that s right .
his salmon don t swim upstream .
he shoots blanks .
lin , he cannot be trusted .
how could you say that?

roy is the type of a friend you d never introduce to your other friends or bring home to your family .
he never speak the truth .

chon wang the man who can fight an emperor .
the emperor should never have his burial knife .
i see .
you re still my brother s lapdog .
i m here not for him .
i m here for my father .
of course you are .
it was my dagger that plunged into his heart .
it s still crusted with his blood .
i know the boy has the seal .
where is he?
we don t know .
that s the truth we don t know .
mmm ...
what are you what are you doing?
stop !
put her down !
put her down !
put her down !
or what , mr. o bannon?
are you gonna kick my ass?
i ve read all about your ridiculous exploits .
i mean , just ... how does it feel to kill a mummy with your bare hands?
only a nation of uneducated rednecks would be amused by such cowboy drivel .
whoa , whoa , whoa .
easy .
what s with the personal attacks?
you don t see me making any comments about your pasty complexion or your snotty accent or even your filthy , smutty sex books .
yeah , i saw your book .
it disgusted me .
oh , why is it always the head with you people? !
hold it !
stop !
hold it !
just hold it !
what are we doing here?
guys , look at this .
we re acting like animals ... over what?
some seal?
the seal represents imperial power .
i will use it to unite the emperor s enemies and storm the forbidden city .
what s in it for you?
you re looking at the future king of england .
you re , like , 20th in line to the throne .
1 0th .
but my friend is about to change all that by simple ... process of elimination .
it s called a machine gun .
the first of its kind it fires 200 rounds a minute .
testament to british ingenuity .
oh , so you steal the seal , and then you knock off nine royals?
you got the short end of that stick , my friend .
dump them in the river .
where are you taking her?
to make history .
i can already see the headlines  nation mourns as loony lin massacres royal family .
i need your assurance that you will find the seal .
don t concern yourself .
my men are scouring the city .
you better pray they find it ... or our agreement is over , and you will never get the crown .
chon , i got a confession to make .
you are in love with my sister .
well , that , but ...
i didn t lose all the money on the zeppelins .
no?
nah .
i blew most of it on the roy o bannon novels .
i wrote them .
no , sage mccallister wrote them .
that s what i m saying , buddy .
i m sage mccallister .
you wrote those lies? !
i ve always had low self esteem .
how many books did you print?
i self published probably a million copies .
we were actually second to the bible that year .
oh , you
i guess i m just about the worst friend a guy could ask for .
no , you re a good friend .
thank you .
lf you really love lin , i won t stand in the way .
really?
but if you break her heart ...
i il break your legs .
that s fair .
well , friends to the end , chon ... and this is the end .
chon , you got a plan?
you wouldn t happen to have a plan , would you?
yes .

i don t care anymore .
roy !
you look ridiculous .
i think we look good .
i really must protest this intrusion .
every bobby in london is out scouring the streets for you two .
have you been drinking?
i always drink when my employment s been terminated .
they fired you?
lord rathbone saw to that .
i m sorry .
it s of no consequence .
i never wanted to be an inspector in the first place .
it was my father s idea .
i always wanted to be a writer .
yeah .
artie , we need your help .
rathbone has taken lin .
he s gonna kill the royal family and he s gonna assume the throne .
do you have any evidence to support these preposterous allegations?
we have this .
it s the boy s .
use your technique .
tell us where he is .
paraffin wax most interesting .
he s at a church .
the little punk s hiding in a church .
no , no , no .
it s not candle wax .
i have it .
don t worry .
you il get it .
what are you doing?
he s picking the lock .
well , hurry up !
chon , please !
please .
it s a very meticulous process .
let artie do his job .
it s almost an art form .
it takes the precision of a surgeon .
you have to be so precise .
maybe if we jam another one in there .
that works , too .
lacks a certain finesse .
all right , all right .
let s split up .
what the ...
i am gonna break your neck .
come here .
looky here .
come on , where is it?
what?
you know what i m talking about .

i m not going back .
well , at least we il get a good view of the fireworks from scotland yard .
fireworks?
yeah .
at midnight , they re launching this huge display from a flotilla of barges on the thames .
it s the official kickoff to the queen s jubilee .
is the royal family gonna be there?
they re gonna be viewing the spectacle from a balcony overlooking the river .
he s got a machine gun on the barge .
yes .
you gents lost your way?
kid , tell me you got a way out .
nice move , kid .
so why did you come back?
why did you give up the seal?
cause i m a fool .

nelson?
why are you hiding yourself back there?
i shouldn t like to impede your view , your highness .
nonsense .
you arranged all this .
you should have a front row view .
i regret that , uh , respectfully i must decline .
i need to keep a good eye on proceedings .
whoo !
nelson , you ve outdone yourself .
wait till you see the finale .
hey !
hey !
oh !
this is hopeless .
we re not gonna get past the guards .

lin !
yee haw !
yeah !
yee haw !

10th .
inspector doyle , arrest this man .
he s got a gun !
