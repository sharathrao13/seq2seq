i was on the varsity .
point guard .

mmh , no .
marvin ray broke the record last year .
he did not .
he did too .
are you sure?
i'm positive .
i coach the girls team .
well ... we were undefeated that year .
then i got kicked off the team for fighting , and the whole thing fell apart .
that's too bad .
hey , you know where jacob elinsky is?
he's an old friend of mine .
now let us sport us while we may ,
and now , like amorous birds of prey ,
rather at once our time devour
than languish in his slow chapt power .
let us roll all our strength and all our sweetness
up into one ball , and tear our pleasures with rough strife
thorough the iron gates of life ...
thus , though we cannot make our sun stand still , yet we will make him run .
good .
that's good .
that's an excellent reading .
what do people think?
what's going on here?
luke .
can i go to the bathroom?
no , you went 20 minutes ago .
uh , i have a , um ... a bladder infection .

i am competing with them .

and if your grades aren't good enough , then ...
your grade's gonna be fine .
vincent piscella writes a story about his grandmother dying , and you give him an a plus .
meanwhile , the night of the funeral , you know where rhodes scholar vince is?
getting smashed at a basketball party and slapping girls 'asses .
i mean , what is that?
a charity a plus?
i mean , everyone is always writing about their grandmothers dying , and you know why?
it's not because it's so traumatic .
it's because it's a guaranteed a plus !
and you're all sentimental like ,
oh , vince , that was very powerful , very moving .
no , it wasn't .
you didn't care .
i didn't care .
nobody cared .
that's what grandmothers do .
they die !
sometimes ... guys have a hard time showing their emotions .
so ...
slapping my ass ... that's , uh ...
vince's way of mourning his dead grandmother?
what did your mother say when you ... when you got that?
when i got what?
uh ...
yeah .
she said , um ...
where did you get the money for that?
oh .
and?
and what did i say or ...
where did i get the money?
well , what did you say?
i said , " he likes me .
oh .

no .
why do you care so much?
just curious .
so , um ...
you're not gonna change the grade?
no .
i'm not gonna change the grade .
great !
you know what?
this was a big waste of my time !
hold on .
oh , god .
just ... just cover my ...
don't freeze up on me , you son of a ...
yeah , slaughtery .
no , i can't talk right now .
employment number's coming out .
i just wanted to let ...
call you later .
i'm supposed to meet you at mont ...
hey , frank , you coming out with us tonight or what?
no , i got to meet some friends tonight .
big date , huh?
who's the new bimbo?
can i bang her first?
yeah , you wish , brother .
no , it's more of a going away party .
now , listen , frank , the other thing ... you still holding onto all those o. e. x. contracts?
you better believe it .
why?
you nervous?
claims numbers have dropped three weeks straight , and i don't feel comfortable with this .
claim numbers drop so everybody thinks employment's gonna be up?
look at me when i talk to you .
everybody's thinking this because it's pretty much always true .
when it rains outside , people get wet .
right or wrong , frank?
not this time , sal .
i got a theory .
look at this .
oh , good !
you've got a theory .
look , frank ... fuck you and your theory .
you're in awfully deep here , frank .
you've got $60 million of the bank's money ... $ 100 million .
whoa ho ! $ 100 fucking million? !
what are you two doing?
you want to be part of the unemployment numbers?
get back to work !
sal , you knew they raised my limit to $ 100 million .
they raised your limit a week ago and you're maxing out?
what am i gonna do?
sit on it?
first of all ... you're not gonna raise your voice to me .
that's first off .
you cannot put me , you , or this firm in jeopardy by putting $ 100 million in one idea !
right or wrong?
come on !
right or wrong .
yeah .
listen ...
i think we're in for a low number , all right?
like 140 , 135 .
i really don't give a shit what you think , frank .
you come in here , you're not even clean shaven .
stop playing with this fucking ball and pay attention to me .
you come in here drinking your red bullshit , stink like booze , you're out all night partying ... and that's okay .
but when you become a cowboy , that's when i draw the line .
i am still your boss , and i am telling you now ... you sell half those contracts .
do i make myself clear?
do i make myself clear , frank?
do i make myself clear to you?
yeah .
yes?
good .

and by the way , we're still on for friday night .
courtside , front row .
don't be late .

salomon brothers , along with most of the street , feel the number is going to be high ... around 250, 000 .
solly's looking for a high number .
280, 000 is their call .
fuck salomon brothers .
fuck , uh ... fuck salomon brothers?
yeah , fuck salomon brothers .
they're hedging their bets .
want everybody on their side of the fence .
uh , what's the big deal with the employment number anyway?
phellan .
it's , uh , phelan .
whatever .
look ...
more jobs means fewer people looking for work .
means it's harder to find good people to fill those jobs .
means you got to raise wages to get them .
means inflation goes up .
you got it?
yeah .
no , i didn't think so .
that's why i'm doing what i'm doing , and you're handing out junk mail .
now , get off my desk .
you're wearing a striped shirt with a striped tie .
you know that , right?
yeah , i do it for that ladies .
do the ladies ever tell you that you look like a fucking optical illusion?
yeah?
go away .
disappear .
come on .
i'm out of here .
you better hop to , sonny boy .
you know , it's funny ...
i don't see you picking up the phone to sell those contracts , and i'm pretty sure i just heard your daddy come over here and cut off your allowance , so i'm a little surprised .
you're not gonna disobey a direct order , are you?
you know , marcuse ... do i come into your bedroom and tell you how to blow your boyfriend?
no .
go away .
hey , schultz !
yo .

fuck my father with his endless grief , standing behind that bar , sipping on club soda , selling whiskey to firemen and cheering the bronx bombers .
let's go , yankees !
fuck this whole city and everyone in it , from the row houses of astoria to the penthouses on park avenue , from the projects in the bronx to the lofts in soho , from the tenements in alphabet city to the brownstones in park slope to the split levels in staten island ,
let an earthquake crumble it , let the fires rage ,
let it burn to fucking ash , and then let the waters rise and submerge this whole rat infested place .
no .
no .
fuck you , montgomery brogan .
you had it all , and you threw it away , you dumb fuck !

he's going to hell for seven years .
what am i gonna do , wish him luck?
just get him drunk .
make sure he has one last good night .
that's it .
so you're up for this?
yeah .
i don't even know why he invited me .
what are you talking about , man?
you know , we hardly ever see each other anymore .
you know , you and i are his friends from the past .
oh , yeah .
like his friends from the present have done him much good .
i just ...
i just can't believe he's going away for seven years .
someone turns him in and ...
oh , don't feed me that shit .
what shit?
come on , jake .
don't feed me that bullshit .
yeah , he got caught .
but hello ...
monty's a fucking drug dealer .
shit .
what , are you ... you driving a vintage super " b "?
no .
no .
he is .
yeah , paid for by the misery of other people .
he got caught .
he's gonna get locked up .
and i'll tell you something else .
you two are my best friends in the whole world , and i love him like a brother , but he fucking deserves it .
he deserves it .
what's he planning on doing with doyle?
how the fuck should i know?
i don't know .
maybe ... leave him with naturelle or something .
they should at least let him take doyle with him .
what?
just let him take doyle with him .
he wouldn't be so lonely .
you can't take a fucking dog to the hoosegow , jake .
i'm just saying it'd be kind of nice if he could .
all right .
yeah , it'd be nice .
monty's tough .
i think he'll be okay .
if it were me , i ...
i'd never last a day , but ...
monty , he's different .
oh , yeah?
you believe that?
yeah .
you don't fucking get it , do you?
what don't i get?
you want the simple version , jake?
guys who look like monty don't do well in prison , all right?
man , he's got three choices , and none of them are good .
one , he can run .
two , catch the bullet train .
bullet train?
i'm not saying what he's gonna do .
i'm saying what his choices are .
his third choice is he goes to prison , that's it .
yeah , and that's what he's gonna do .
he'll go and i'll see him when he gets out .
maybe .
i'll tell you what .
after tonight , it's bye bye , monty .
what does that mean?
man , if he runs , he's gone .
he ain't coming home .
if he pulls the trigger , they close the casket .
he's gone .
they lock him away , he's gone .
you'll never see him again .
i'll see him again .
no , you won't .
i'll visit him up there and i'll see him when he gets out .
this is such horseshit .
this is so much like you , jake .
you're not gonna see him ...
like me?
yeah , it's ... exactly .
what's ... why ...
you'll never see him again .
you think you're gonna kick back with some beers , reminisce ... old times ... you're still gonna be friends?
it's over after tonight , jake .
wake the fuck up .
let her go .
that's a good looking girl you got there .
them spanish broads .
ooh .
that's a scary look .
yikes .
you see the look he gave me?
naturelle riviera ... what a name .
you see the rack on that girl?
you know what?
take another angle , man .
you can't fucking touch her .
no .
no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no .
you're missing the point .
she touched you .
you're lying .
am i?
yeah .
oh , that's sweet .
you really trust her .
all i know is she's walking away .
yeah .
we just signed her release .
probably having a big party tonight over at jimmy's bronx cafe .
sure .
why not?
big celebration .
she got that whole fancy apartment to herself now .
what?
you thought she was with you for your looks?
sh e e e it .
girl saw a pot of honey , and she licked it clean .
yeah .
she's a real smart girl .
now , you , on the other hand ...
you're supposed to be smart .
got yourself a scholarship to a fancy private school , hmm?
not bad for a punk from bay ridge .
yeah , but then you go and get yourself thrown out for dealing weed to some rich kids .
what up with that?
you know what happens to pretty boys like you in prison?
ooh .
they gonna love you .
yeah , maybe .
but then again ... maybe not .
jeez , your honor , you know , what can i say?
i messed up .
you know , my mother died .
i i was so worried about my father .
i needed to help him out .
my head was a little turned around .
i got hooked in with the wrong people ,
and i made a big mistake .
i really did , but ... it was my first time .
i'm sorry , and it will never , ever happen again .
time served .
probation .
you don't read the papers much , do you , smart guy?
in new york , we've got a wonderful thing called the rockefeller laws .
let me educate you .
you had a kilo in your sofa .
that kind of weight makes it an a 1 felony .
15 years to life minimum for first offense .
now , with that much spread in the sentencing guidelines , the judges take their cues from the prosecutors .
so if mr. prosecutor's wife busted his chops that morning , you're fucked .
you're gone for good .
if you get lucky ... really lucky ... now , let's say he got some good trim the night before .
maybe he'll plead you off to an a 2 .
but that's still three to eight for first time ... minimum .
how much of that stretch you pull is all up to the mood of the prosecutor , and he's gonna ask us , " did he play ball?
so ... why don't you tell us about your friend nikolai?
let us make it easy on you .
can i ask you one question?
sure .
when you have your dick in his mouth , does he just keep talking like that?
'cause it seems to me he just never shuts up , and i'm ...
i'm just curious ... does that ... does that get annoying?
you know , you're fucking a guy in the mouth ,
and he just won't shut up .
look here , you vanilla motherfucker .
when you're upstate taking it in the culo by a bunch of guys calling you shirley , you'll only have yourself and governor rockefeller to thank for the privilege .
let's get the hell out of here .
tell the u. s. attorney we got a hard ass .
you need a girlfriend .
i need a girlfriend?
yeah .
wait a minute .
when was the last time you had a girlfriend?
all right?
when was the last time you got laid?
i've got prospects .
yeah , you got prospects .
i do .
you know what?
you're in the 62nd percentile is what you are .
what is that?
62nd percentile?
yeah .
that's where you rate .
all the bachelors in new york , we're all competing for the same women ... well , the straight bachelors .
and i'm in the 62nd percentile?
yes , sir .
so in other words ,
i'm better than 62 % of the new york bachelors .
you're rated higher than them , yeah .
but worse than what , 38 %?
37 .
no 100 percentile .
how'd you come up with 62?
there's a whole science to figuring it out .
there's a science to figuring it out?
that sounds very scientific .
and if i may inquire , what's your rating?
funny you should ask .
hmm .
because i happen to fall right in the 99 percentile .
of course .
who came up with the ratings?
i did .
you came up with the ratings?
and you get a 99?
that's very interesting .
yeah?
what are these , uh , based on?
it's just a system .
i mean , that's your rating .
i'm not saying you're a bad person , jake .
no , you're just saying i'm a bad bachelor .
you're a better than average bachelor .
what ... what are the criteria?
first , money .
you have none .
trust funds don't count for shit because it's a red flag that says ,
mommy and daddy could turn off the cash flow one day .
so that right there keeps you out of the top 10 % .
10 % of the ... gold diggers?
10 % period .
two ... you got chronic bad breath .
no offense , but most women won't sleep with a guy with stank breath , so ...
fuck you .
you don't have to get so annoyed , all right?
what puts you in the 99th percentile?
that's what i'm wondering .
okay .
well , first of all , i , um ...
what?
besides your salary and all the money you make .
all right .
i happen to be blessed with a very big dick .
genetics , man .
doesn't dyeing your hair drop you down a few places?
nope .
not at all .
only bothers women if it bothers me .
going gray does bother you .
no , it doesn't .
of course it does .
if it didn't bother you , you wouldn't smear that goop all over your scalp 10 billion times a day .
hey , it's a non issue , jake .
well , are table manners an issue?
see that silver thing to the left of your plate?
that's called a fork .
mm hmm .
and when people eat rice , they use chopsticks or a fork .
yeah , and grown people don't eat ... fried rice with their bare hands .
you don't know how to behave .
you're busting my balls on the way i eat?
you spend the whole week figuring out how to defraud foreign governments ... whatever you do ... and then you get out of there and you go out to the strange world outside your office called reality ... and you don't know how to behave .
oh , yeah?
i rest my case .
you gonna tell me about reality?
jacob , you're a rich jewish kid from the upper east side who's ashamed of his wealth .
you walk around unhappy 24 7 trying to make up for the fact that you were born privileged .
fuck that .
you know what?
that's just some knee jerk liberalism bullshit , man .
you call that reality?
so what's monty?
let's see .
monty's going to prison .
he's a doughnut ... big , fat zero .
yo .
let's not go to practice .
just today .
so don't go .
let's go to my house .
come on , nat .
let's go .
my mother won't be home till late , either .
and there's food .
good , 'cause i ain't got no money .
vito's home .
so?
what's that?
nothing .
i don't care .
you don't care , nat?
what do you mean now?
yeah , right .
you know you likededed him forever .
i never likededed him .
you're always trying to hook us up because you want me to be your sister in law , but it ain't never happening .
don't front like you don't likededed him .
nat , please , okay?
every day you come to my house ...
vito , walk me home " ...

what kind of bullshit is that?
anyway , he's always with that girl .
what's up , simon?
monty , how you doing?
good to see you , man .
good to see you .
who's that?
it's a new guy .
he's golden .
he's good .
now , you know what i told you .
he's big .
it's like , " beep , beep " ... back up your truck , man , you know what i'm saying?
all right , simon .
i'll handle my business , all right?
just trying to help .
all right .
take it easy .
when did he break up with her?
like a month ago .
but she don't stop .
she calls the house , she calls , she hangs up .
please .
please .
did he break up with her , or she broke up with him?
he needs somebody good .
excuse me .
why doesn't he ...
excuse me .
you got a light?
what?
can i borrow your lighter for a second?
thanks a lot .
what's he doing?
he's loco .
yo , i've met you before , haven't i?
you do look familiar to me .
how do i know you?
yeah .

pete .
mm hmm .
yeah , i know who you are .
yo , nat , come on .
let's go .
we got practice .
i'll catch up .
yeah , all right .
whatever .
you stupid .
what do you got practice for?
basketball .
seriously?
you play?
come on .
what are you , a guard?
three spot .
you play small forward?
no shit?
that means you're strong and quick .
i play the one ... point .
you skip too many of these things , they'll give you the boot ... for real .
i just want to finish my cigarette .
funny .
you don't ...
i don't know .
i wouldn't have made you for a ballplayer , you know?
you look more like a ...
like a ... runner , like a track star .
where you from?
no , i mean ... you from uptown?
u. f. a.?
you on a scholarship?
what , i can't be from riverdale?
you can be from wherever you want .
just ... curious .
i didn't mean nothing .
i was just ...
you know , i i was on scholarship , too .
it's a good thing .
you ... you're lucky .
what ... what's your name?
nat?
natalie?
naturelle .
naturelle?
are you serious?
naturelle .
wow .
i like that name .
how old are you?
18 .
are you 18?
why?
'cause it's not every day
i meet a girl as pretty as you who plays the three spot .
that's deadly .
how old are you?
i'm old enough to have to ask .
you're too old to be hanging out on the playground .
i wasn't hanging out .
i was ...
i was passing by .
what if i was 17?
it might shorten the conversation a little .
but you're not .
you're 18 , so we got no problem .
what do you say i come and see you play sometime?
seriously .
i'd like to .
maybe .
maybe?
okay .
i'll be the one behind the bench yelling , " get back on 'd '!
see ya .
hey .
come out here and meet somebody .
who's that?
she's just the girl for you .
hey , jody .
you back there?
hey , baby .
hey , sweetie .
how you doing?
hi .
hi .
is this your little brother , frank?
he's a cutie .
don't bother with me .
i'm in the 62nd percentile .
oh .
that's probably because you don't work on wall street .
the scale is skewed to the money thing .
everybody knows about this .
everybody knows .
anybody at this bar .
you see that ass?
she's beautiful .
mm hmm .
man .
one of the guys at school ... this , uh , biology teacher , terry ...
mm hmm .
did you ever meet terry?
no , i don't think so .
anyway , he , uh , he ... he really likes this girl .
like a student?
a student .
yeah .
a junior .
oh , man .
i mean , the gir" s 16 , 17 , maybe .
i don't know .
uh , she's not really pretty , um ... not in the , uh , classical sense , but she ...
i don't know .
she's ... she's got something .
you know .
mm hmm .
and i told him .
i ...
i told terry , you know , to just forget about it , you know?
he's kind of obsessing , and it's kind of scary the way he talks about it .
but he's like ...
five years from now ,
she'll almost be out of college .
