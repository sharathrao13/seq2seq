tell that dipshit to get fucked !
bravo , it's two five .
we're moving out shortly .

what the hell's the matter with you , taylor?
you are one simple son of a bitch !
i'm sorry , sergeant .

reds are killers .
black ants are the worst .
hurry up , lard ass !
i'm so tired .
just a little .
don't drink too much .
i don't want you drinking any more .
i don't want you cramping up .
you're humping too much stuff , troop .
you don't need half this shit .
i'll haul it for you , but next time you check with me first , all right?
ok .
thanks , sarge .
are you ok?
two two , this is six .
i understand you have a bird inbound at your pos at this time .
bravo six , bravo six , be advised , re supply helo is inbound at this time .

let's go , you people !

it ain't d e r e , it's d e a r , and " sarah " ain't got no two rs , king .
damn , you dumb !
it don't make no difference .
she know what i mean .
she don't read too good nohow !
look at this shit !
pork again !
let me have that turkey loaf for this pork shit .
i can't eat this shit !
what you been smoking , junior?
i hope you don't get that laundry gig .
i hope manny get it , cos your ass need to hump , hump and hump !
hey , white boy ... what you waiting for?
that hole ain't gonna dig itself .
come on , get your dick skin on that thing !
dig !
you ain't got all day !
dig !
dig !
hell is the impossibility of reason .
that's what this place feels like hell .
i hate it already and it's only been a week .
some goddamn week , grandma .
the hardest thing i've ever done is go on point .
three times this week .
i don't know what i'm doing .
a gook could be three feet in front of me and i wouldn't know it .
i'm so tired .
we get up at 5am , hump all day , camp around four or five , dig a foxhole , eat , then put out an all night ambush or a three man listening post .
it's scary cos nobody tells me how to do anything , cos i'm new .
nobody cares about new guys .
they don't even wanna know your name .
a new guy's life isn't worth as much cos he hasn't put his time in yet .
they say if you're gonna get killed , it's better to get it in the first few weeks .
the logic being you don't suffer that much .
if you're lucky , you stay in the perimeter , then you pull a three hour guard shift .
maybe you sleep three , four hours a night ...
but you don't really sleep .
i don't think i can keep this up for a year , grandma .
i think i've made a big mistake coming here .
we got boo coo movement .
third battalion just got hit 15 kliks north of here .
charlie had claymores in the trees , blew a whole fucking platoon to pieces .
bad shit .
yeah .
they got two lieutenants and a captain .
all right , sergeant , who do you want on ambush?
elias ... you take your squad out .
warren , you stay in , but i'll need tex and junior from your squad .
roger that .
ok , move out in two zero mikes .
i thought it was o'neill's turn .
no !
tubbs and morehouse are short .
fu sheng's on an r and r tomorrow , and you wanna send them out on an ambush?
you got the fresh meat , buddy .
they don't know shit , and chances are we're gonna run into something .
what do you want me to do?
send one of my guys to get zapped , so some lame ass can get his beauty sleep?
o'neill ...
take a break !
you don't have to be a prick every day of your life !
elias , get your men ready .
he's in three years and thinks he's jesus fucking christ !
o'neill , your short timers stay in , but you go out .
i need veterans out there .
sergeant barnes .
i think , in front of the men , it's necessary for me to give the orders .
yes , sir .
shit , looks like it's gonna rain .
it's gonna piss on us all night .
i'm gonna put a serious case of crotch rot on that ugly face of yours , junior .
goddamn , man !
you break your ass for the white man !
no justice around here !
what's o'neill got?
a nose up the lieutenant's ass already?
how come we always get fucking ambush?
cos it's politics , man , politics .
chris , show you a picture of lucy jean?
no , you didn't .
she's the one for me all right , that lucy jean .
she's waiting for me .
real pretty .
you're a lucky guy , gardner .
hey , you got a picture of your girl?
i guess that leaves some unlucky girl back at home , don't it?
tuck this in .
shitcan this .
don't need this .
turn around .
come on .
tex , you got junior and taylor here on your position .
goddamn it , elias , don't mess with my pig !
i ain't getting greased , so you keep this sorry cheese dick off my ass !
you got taylor .
gardner , you're with me .
look , case anything happens , you get lost or separated , don't yell out , ok?
just sit tight and we'll get to you .
saddle up !
lock and load !
mom and dad didn't want me to come here .
they wanted me to be like them . : respectable , hard working , a family .
they drove me crazy with their goddamn world , grandma .
you know mom .
i've always been sheltered .
i just wanna be anonymous like everybody else , do my share for my country .
live up to what grandpa did in the first war , and dad did in the second .
well , here i am , anonymous , with guys nobody really cares about .
most come from the end of the line , small towns you never heard of .
pulaski , tennessee .
brandon , mississippi .
pork bend , utah .
wampum , pennsylvania .
two years 'high school's about it .
if they're lucky , a job waiting for them back in a factory .
most have got nothing .
they're poor .
they're the unwanted .
yet they're fighting for our society and our freedom .
it's weird , isn't it?
at the bottom of the barrel , and they know it .
maybe that's why they're called " grunts " , cos a grunt can take it , can take anything .
they're the best i've ever seen , grandma .
the heart and soul .
taylor ...
cheese dick , you're up .
what?
you're up .
sure you know how to work the claymores , dude?
flick the safety off and bang on that sucker three times .
i got it .
don't catch any zs on me , buddy , or i'll sling your sorry ass .
you hear me?
maybe i've finally found it way down here in the mud .
maybe from here i can start up again .
be something i can be proud of without having to be a fake human being .
maybe i can see something i don't yet see , or learn something i don't yet know .
i miss you .
i miss you very much .
tell mom i miss her , too .
chris .
junior .

you volunteered for this shit , man?
can you believe that?
you's a crazy fucker ... giving up college .
didn't make much sense .
i wasn't learning anything .
why should just the poor kids go off to war and the rich kids get away with it?
what we got here is a crusader .
sounds like it .
you gotta be rich in the first place to think like that .
everybody know ... the poor always being fucked over by the rich .

so we don't fight , so we become pacifists .
don't you worry , bunny .
you's a killer anyway , man .
i still like a piece of pussy once in a while .
ain't nothing like a piece of pussy , 'cept maybe the indy 500 .
only way you'd get some pussy is if a bitch dies and wills it to you and then ... maybe !

sometimes i just look at a guy and i know this fella's not gonna make it .
just no fucking way .
get it going now !
new year's day , 1968 .
just another day .
staying alive .
there's been a lot of movement near the cambodian border .
a lot of little firefights , ambushes .
we drop bombs , then we walk through the jungle like ghosts in a landscape .
bunker .
where?
roger .
bunkers at point .
two actuals on the way .
bravo six , bravo two .
be advised there is a bunker complex up front .
we're on the way down .

the nva have been spotted in the village half a klik down the river .
six says we gotta get there asap .
also , leave four of your men here , and a medic , ok?
move it out .
pull the flanks in !
let's move !
hey , where's manny?
yo , washington !
manny , where you at?
we had to get to the village before dark , so we left elias with some men to keep looking .
but it was king who found him , about a thousand yards downriver , not far from the village .
it was the end of the mystery .
the motherfuckers !
the village which had stood for maybe 1, 000 years didn't know we were coming that day .
if they had , they would've run .
barnes was at the eye of our rage and , through him , our captain ahab .
he would set things right again .
that day we loved him .
there he goes , sarge !
check him out .
yeah , you got it , sarge .
tubbs , ebenhock , let's go !

sergeant warren , you bring that honcho over here .
tubbs , get outta there .
junior , burn it .

i never seen brains like that before , man !

we leave now , and nobody saw a fucking thing !
you understand me , taylor?
let's fucking do her !
let's do this whole fucking village !
look at the scars on this gook honcho , sarge .
get out of here , tubbs .
where'd he get these wounds?
says he was hit in a bombing raid .
he's a dink for sure !
ask him why these weapons were here .
they had no choice .
the nva killed the old honcho when he said no .
all the rice is theirs .
bullshit , lerner !
who the hell was the gook we nailed on the riverbank?
he doesn't know .
he says nva ain't been around in a couple of months .
maybe it was a scout or something .
yeah , sure , a scout !
what about the fucking rice and the weapons?
who are they for?
that cocksucker knows what i'm saying .
goddamn right he does !
he's lying through his teeth !
waste the fucker !
where the hell's the vc?
he swears he doesn't know anything .
he hates the nva , but ...
what's the bitch saying?
she's going on about why we killed the pigs .
they gotta make a living .
all that shit .
shut up !
shut the fuck up !
you tell him , he starts talking or i'm gonna waste more of 'em !
tell him , lerner !
hey , sarge !
let us in on this , all right?
let's go for it !
let's do the whole fucking village !
come on !
what the fuck are we waiting for?
let's do 'em !
outta my way !
this is his daughter , right?
right?
you lie !
no , you lie !
you vc !
barnes !
what the fuck do you think you're doing?
stay outta this , elias .
this ain't your show .
you ain't a firing squad , you piece of shit !
tear his fucking head off !
break it up !
break it up !
you're dead , elias !
i swear to fucking god , you're dead !

you're gonna do time in lbj !
this shit won't wash , you fucking puke !
break it up !
shut up !
break it up !
listen up !
captain says to torch this place !
torch this place !
blow the weapons in place !
round up all suspected vc and shake it up !
we ain't got much light left !
lieutenant ...
why didn't you do something?
what are you talking about?
you know what i'm talking about !
no , i don't .
i don't know what the fuck you're talking about , elias !
all right , move it out !
let's go !
taylor , let's go , for christ's sake !
move it out !
police up the weapons , and let's go !

morehouse !

you fucker !
what is this?
what , you a homosexual , taylor?
taylor , she's a fucking dink !
she's a fucking human being , man !
fuck you !
you're a fucking cherry , taylor !
fucking animal !
all of you , you're fucking animals !
fucking lame fuck !
you don't belong in nam , man !
ain't your place at all !
you don't fucking get it , do you , man?
you just don't fucking get it .
it's ok .
get outta there !
police up your dicks and let's get outta here .
i didn't see anything , sir .
i did .
that dink was reported to me as nva .
my report will include lieutenant wolfe as being witness to the shooting .
all right , elias .
staff sergeant barnes .
i want a full report on this when we get back to the cp .
you got it , and i can throw in plenty of eyewitnesses if you want , sir .
not now , goddamn it , not now !
we'll get into this when we get to camp .
if i find out there was an illegal killing , there will be a court martial .
right now i need every man in the field .
and you two will cease fire .
staff sergeant barnes , sergeant elias ...
you hear me?
we're back in that nva bunker complex tomorrow .
this time from the east .
you people get some rest and be back here at the cp at 1900 for a briefing .
come on , man .
you think these chucks give a fuck about us?
it could just as well have been you , harold , if you got in barnes 'way .
and that bunny?
that motherfucker's crazy !
i mean , he scares me , man .
he just scares me .
you bloods are getting too hung up on all this shit .
these gooks are smarter than you think .
barnes knows his shit , man .
they was nva , every last one of 'em .
he's taken us this far , right?
he'll take us the rest of the way .
a christian don't go around a village cutting off heads and shit .
this shit is really getting outta hand , man .
you don't seem to know the difference , the way you shoot up that shit all the time .
i don't know , brothers , but i'm hurting real bad inside .
don't worry about it .
elias won't be able to prove a thing .
he's a troublemaker .
elias is a water walker .
like them politicians trying to fight this war with one hand tied around their balls .
ain't no need or time for a courtroom out here .
sarge .
thanks , bun .
how'd it go there , bob?
yeah , that away , sarge .
fucking elias , man .
he's a fucking rat , that's what he is .
he's gonna get everybody in deep shit .
somebody oughta frag his ass .
so whaddaya think , bob?
gonna be an investigation or what?
o'neill , man , you worry too much .
sarge'll take care of it .
it's a beautiful night .
yeah .
i love this place at night .
the stars ...
there's no right or wrong in 'em .
they're just there .
that's a nice way of putting it .
barnes has got it in for you , doesn't he?
barnes believes in what he's doing .
and you?
do you believe?
in '65 ... yeah .
now ... no .
what happened today is just the beginning .
we're gonna lose this war .
come on !
you really think so?
us?
we've been kicking other people's asses for so long , it's time we got ours kicked .
day by day , i struggle to maintain not only my strength , but my sanity .
it's all a blur .
i have no energy to write .
i don't know what's right and what's wrong any more .
the morale of the men is low .
there's civil war in the platoon .
half the men with elias , half with barnes .
there's a lot of suspicion and hate .
i can't believe we're fighting each other when we should be fighting them .
counting days , and the six inches in front of my face .
not much else .
hope things are well , grandma .
tell mom and dad i ...
well ... just tell them .
chris .
hey , big boy , i know you thought you had that laundry gig all laid out .

elias didn't ask you to fight his battles for him .
and if there's a heaven and , god , i hope there is
i know he's sitting up there drunk as a fucking monkey , and smoking shit , cos he done left his pains down here .

taylor ...
i remember when you first came in here , telling me how you admired the bastard !
i was wrong .
you ain't never been right ... about nothing !
and dig this , you assholes , and dig it good !
barnes has been shot seven times , and he ain't dead !
does that mean anything to you , huh?
barnes ain't meant to die !
the only thing that could kill barnes ... is barnes .
talking about killing?
you all experts?
you all know about killing?
i'd like to hear about it , potheads .
you smoking this shit so as to escape from reality?
me , i don't need this shit .
i am reality .
there's the way it ought to be , and there's the way it is .
elias was full of shit .
elias was a crusader .
i got no fight with any man who does what he's told , but when he don't ... the machine breaks down .
and when the machine breaks down we break down .
and i ain't gonna allow that from any of you .
not one .
you all love elias .
you wanna kick ass .
well , here i am , all by my lonesome .
and there ain't nobody gonna know .
six of you boys against me .

you'll go dinky dow in lbj .
ten years for killing an enlisted man .
ten years climbing the fucking walls .
don't do it !
death?
what do you all know about death?
they sent us back into the valley the next day , about 2000 meters from cambodia , into a battalion perimeter .
it felt like we were returning to the scene of a crime .
alpha company had been hit hard by a sizeable force and charlie company had been probed that night .
there were other battalions in the valley , but we knew we were gonna be the bait to lure them out .
somewhere out there was the entire 141st nva regiment .
caught those motherfuckers trying to pull some shit on charlie company .
they found maps on 'em , man .
a friend at battalion says they had every fucking foxhole fixed on it .
distances ... tree lines ... our claymores ...
everything .
this is bad , man .
i got bad vibes here .
i also heard we're in fucking cambodia now .
cambodia?
man , you kidding me !
you wanted to see me , sir?
looks like you got elias's squad now .
i didn't know we were still referring to this platoon in terms of squads .
take those two holes there and there .
you're tying it off with barnes up here , king down there .
my holes are far enough apart you could run a regiment through and never see it !
i got five live bodies left , sir .
i don't wanna hear your problems .
you'll get new men any day .
make do like everybody else .
i didn't ask for this job .
i don't wanna hear it .
you don't wanna hear it?
that's right .
i don't wanna hear it cos , to tell you the truth , i don't give a shit , ok?
i don't give a flying fuck any more .
i'm glad i ain't going with 'em .
somewhere out there's the beast , and he hungry tonight .

i remember when you first come out here to the bush .
you was green as a ...

there's a way out of anything , man .
just keep your pecker hard and your powder dry and the worm will turn .
how many days are you short?
nah , it's not just me .
it's the way the whole thing works .
people like elias get wasted .
people like barnes go on making up the rules any way they want .
so what do we do?
sit in the middle and suck on it .
we just don't add up to dry shit , king .
whoever said we did , man?
all you got to do is make it outta here and it's all gravy .
every day , the rest of your life gravy !

we gonna get high , high !
sergeant o'neill !
how are you doing?
just fine , sir .
that's good , cos you got second platoon .
yes , sir .
ready?
you bet .
i think now , looking back , we did not fight the enemy , we fought ourselves , and the enemy ... was in us .
the war is over for me now , but it will always be there , for the rest of my days , as i'm sure elias will be , fighting with barnes for what rhah called possession of my soul .
there are times since
i've felt like the child born of those two fathers .
but be that as it may , those of us who did make it have an obligation to build again , to teach to others what we know , and to try with what's left of our lives to find a goodness , and meaning , to this life .
