so how was it?
good .
you're gonna go ahead?
full steam .
anything i can do to change your mind?
nope .
no way .
no matter how hot it gets up there during the day . . . . . . there's not a " " not a damn thing to do at night .
what the hell are you gonna do at night in the middle of nowhere?
sleep like a winner .
doug , you're a city boy with a low threshold of boredom .
you'll be back in two weeks .
come in the office for a minute .
i got people waiting upstairs .
i wanted to tell you . . . . . . senator parker's coming to the dedication tonight .
he's almost guaranteed the urban renewal contract .
do you know what that means?
skyscrapers like this all over the country .
you design them .
i'll build them .
jim , i think you suffer from an edifice complex .
you'll never leave .
after the party , come on downstairs and watch me burn my black tie .
glad to see you back .
doug , i can't understand it .
the dampers won't stay opened .
whatever happened to " hello "?
hello .
how are you?
good .
you look like it took .
hi , mr. roberts .
just a second .
we'll miss you .
duncan know?
he's all smiles .
what electromagnets went in?
doug?
thompson g 4s .
don't you think they should be g 12s?
that's what comes from last minute panic .
i'll fix it .
there's ground water on that atlanta job .
bring the designs in today .
how about chicago specs?
philadelphia?
in a minute , guys .
well , hello .
welcome back .
are you taking any calls?
who's there?
no , i'm not taking any calls .
are we gonna talk at all?
no .
it's my lunch hour .
well , i'm not a cheeseburger , you know .
you're better .
all protein , no bread .
all i need to go with you is about eight glasses of water .
all i need to go with you is in that suitcase .
i got about a $140 worth of vulgar underwear for you .
first things first .
that's nice .
years from now , when they talk about this , and they will . . . . . . remember to tell them that it was my idea .
got change for a 50?
sorry , it's the smallest i have .
not a chance !
let's see what we got here . . . .
twenty five , 50 , 60 . . .
. . . 70 , 75 . . .
. . . 85 , 95 .
that's it exactly .
catch your tip next time .
all your security squad's up there . . . .
hello , mrs. allbright .
hi , phillip .
we won't be so messy tomorrow .
we're gonna try charcoals .
mommy wants to know if you'll have dinner with us?
thank you , but i'm going up to the tower party .
aren't you coming?
mommy says thanks , but she doesn't go to parties since daddy died .
here , let me take that paint off .
bye .
how are you , phillip?
sorry , mrs. mueller , what was that?
i said how are you?
okay .
goodbye .
okay , i'll get on it right now .
i'll have to check the panel .
have to see if all those light up .
mr. callahan?
we still got any g 12 electrodes?
yeah , main storeroom .
right .
okay , booster pump , zone one .
one ten .
check .
main generator , zone one .
i don't get any reading .
try the auxiliary generator .
what the hell?
go ahead .
here we are .
are there offices on this floor , as well as apartments?
i wouldn't like that at all !
the business offices only go up to 80 .
from the 81 st floor , here . . . . . . all the way up to 120 , it's exclusively residential .
now , the apartment i want to show you is 8145 . . . .
say , bill?
tune in the main utility room .
something's screwed up .
the sensor didn't trip the fire alarm .
why should it?
you can see for yourself .
there's no fire .
the sensor indicates there is .
plus wes just called .
he said they're having wiring problems down there .
you better stay with it .
i want you up there with me .
we can do good things together .
what's the matter?
hello?
dave's leaving .
they've offered me managing editor .
that's nice .
i mean i guess we've got ourselves a situation .
it seems .
i want the kind of life you're talking about .
i want that .
i want a place where our kids can run around and grow and be free .
but?
i want this job .
i wanted it for five years .
i've worked for it for five years .
now suddenly it's there .
see , i have ideas , doug .
i can do something with it that hasn't been done before .
i guess i want both , and i can't have both .
can l?
i don't know .
where?
be right there .
let's hold this off till tonight .
what happened?
we kicked on the auxiliary , and this shorted out .
power off?
what about that?
it should've been conduit .
give me a pair of dikes .
i know , i know .
callahan called me .
now just how bad is it?
depends on how good your imagination is .
jesus christ !
specs called for conduit safety covering .
how many fuse terminals did you check?
how many do i have to?
mr. bigelow is here , sir .
okay , send him in .
now , doug , one piece of scorched wire . . . . . . from a burned out circuit breaker isn't conclusive .
maybe not .
but now i'm worried about what other shocks we're in for .
will , doug . . . . . . j. d. , wait till you see this .
what happened?
was the wallpaper hung wrong?
we have an equipment problem .
no problem in the tower , is there?
could be .
come on .
you're just guessing .
i want to talk to your son in law .
i wanna talk to him right away .
get roger simmons .
yes , sir .
i guarantee i'll check this out .
we're all going to check it out .
i'm missing something .
we damn near had a fire .
yeah , a fire .
in this building?
come on .
we haven't finished installing the safety equipment .
the party should've been put off  hold it , will !
everybody's overreacting .
mr. simmons is out , sir .
out where?
they don 't know , sir , but i left word for him to call .
we'll talk to roger tomorrow .
and then we'll decide what to do .
that's okay , isn't it?
nope .
won't wait .
try zone one again .
damn it !
this is top priority .
we gotta get these electrical systems on .
our security program's loused up without them .
don't go away .
doug !
well , what a surprise !
where's that electrical genius of yours?
i called his office , the club , the marina .
no luck .
what's he done?
come on , i'll get you a drink .
he must've done something .
my father called .
he hasn't been that upset in years .
have any idea where he is?
well my husband's territory ranges rather widely .
it's like that of the timber wolf , anywhere within a 50 mile radius .
but if you wanna wait , he'll show up .
he has to .
his clothes are here .
can i get you a drink?
no , thanks .
i guess you don't plan to tell me what roger's done .
hi , doug .
honey .
hello .
what are you drinking these days?
nothing , right now .
well , welcome back from the wilderness .
to what do we owe the pleasure?
callahan was testing a backup generator .
there was a systems failure .
how can that be?
it can't be , theoretically .
unless you screwed around with the electrical specifications .
that's being rather blunt , isn't it?
you betcha .
then you'll understand my being equally blunt .
what the hell business is it of yours?
i wonder what kickbacks were involved .
i don't have to take crap from you .
listen .
we had an electrical flare up in the main utility room .
some of that wiring wasn't exactly what i asked for .
all the wire i put in is up to code , inspected and approved .
code's not enough for that building !
and you know it !
i asked for installations way above standard .
buddy , you live in a dream world .
i deal in realities .
i want your wiring diagrams and copies of your work orders .
that would take weeks and a lot more clout than you have !
in my office !
tomorrow , 9 : 00 .
they say he used to wrestle grizzly bears in montana .
of course , he was younger then .
probably in better condition .
you must have enjoyed all this immensely .
no , i didn't .
actually , i'm depressed for both of us .
what did you expect me to do?
punch him in the nose?
if you've done anything to dad's building , god help you .
baby , i don't need god's help or your old man's .
not anymore .
so don't expect me to shake every time daddy barks . . . . . . even if that's what you want me to do .
all i want is the man i thought i married .
i guess we're running out of reasons to stay married , aren't we?
it's getting late .
mustn't miss the party .
stand back , please !
everybody , back of the ropes !
stand back , please .
everybody , back of the ropes !
hi .
7 : 30 sharp .
i hope you like your men prompt .
at my age?
i only care that they show up at all .
nonsense .
be a good girl , elke .
i left you some milk in the kitchen .
see you later .
did you find simmons?
yeah , i found him .
did he or didn't he change your specs?
he didn't admit it , but i bet you he did .
payoffs and kickbacks .
the only way he could've swung it .
here you are . . . . . . your original specs .
zone one only , but we gotta start somewhere .
that son of a bitch gave us an impossible job .
susan .
hello , dan .
good evening .
how are you , dear?
congratulations .
it's magnificent .
thank you .
i'll meet you out front .
i'd like to talk to susan .
right .
find me the architect who designed you . . . . . . and who needs doug roberts?
i do .
ladies and gentlemen , this is a gala evening .
the entire city is in a holiday mood .
the list of luminaries reads like a who's who .
there are leaders from society and government . . . . . . stars of screen and television .
and now , just arriving , the honorable gary parker . . . . . . chairman of the federal urban renewal commission .
the senator's in from washington to be here for the dedication .
senator parker , ladies and gentlemen .
we'll try to get him to the microphone to say a few words for you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you very much .
i'm honored to be here tonight .
this magnificent building represents yet another landmark . . . . . . in a long succession of landmarks for this great city .
i think you've got him in the bag , jim . being here at this historic moment .
thank you .
and now , ladies and gentlemen , mr. and mrs. roger simmons .
mrs. simmons is the daughter of the builder , jim duncan .
how are you?
nice to see you , senator .
shake hands with mr. duncan , please .
where were you all day?
i wasn't aware the leash was that tight .
later , i wanna ask you a few questions . . . . . . and i expect some straight answers .
and now , ladies and gentlemen , mayor and mrs. robert ramsay .
i thank you very much .
i hereby dedicate this magnificent glass tower . . . . . . tallest building in the world !
we'll make it .
that's it .
all right , callahan?
hit them .
this way .
it's really something , isn't it?
after you .
come on , dan .
i'm going by the office .
i'll be up in a few minutes .
i've never seen the bridge look like that .
it's unbelievable !
astonishing !
how did it go down there , mr. bigelow?
fine , thank you .
good night .
shall i leave you a night line?
no , you can disconnect .
i've had it with phones for today .
lorrie . . . .
sorry , but i have a letter that must go out .
see you monday , janet .
gee , i never thought he'd come back here before the party .
we almost missed him .
it's all right .
i'm not gonna do anything tonight .
have a nice weekend .
thanks .
you too .
hello .
hi .
promise me something?
what?
if i ever start taking you for granted , do something about it .
and what do you suggest?
cut off the phone lines .
pour coffee down my neck .
tweak my nose?
i promise .
how's the family?
fine , thank you .
good .
gary?
would you excuse us , gentlemen?
certainly .
i've got a surprise for you .
politicians don't like surprises .
carlos?
yes , sir .
what can i fix you?
meet senator parker .
great pleasure .
it's an honor , senator .
show him what you've been hiding back there .
yes , sir .
1929?
that's all you'll drink tonight .
a whole case?
what you don't drink , we'll ship to washington .
open a bottle , will you?
yes , sir .
how did you ever come by a whole case?
come on , jim .
it's nothing .
i guess you're looking for someone .
i am .
have you seen him?
i've ordered for patty .
what can i get you?
nothing right now .
thank you , roger .
susan , tell me . . . .
what does a girl do in san francisco when her old man . . . . . . decides to leave for two years?
beats me , buddy .
no headhunting?
i've had a little trouble making that work .
could we discuss that tomorrow at lunch?
no .
you must miss your villa .
well , yes and no .
it gets rather dull in the south of france .
nothing but swimming and yachting , partying and all that sort of thing .
and believe it or not , they fight over the few eligible bachelors .
even such old scraps as l .
no false humility , please .
oh , shall we?
the stock market .
monte carlo's losses , san francisco's gains .
thank you .
do you believe in destiny?
i believe in all good things .
there must be a reason for my coming back home .
meeting you .
this can't be right .
it's too hot .
you better leave it off .
utility .
wes .
doug , i'm up on 83 with will .
we got a wiring problem .
overloads could be trouble .
shut down as many of the zone one systems as you can .
i can't do that .
all the lights are on for the dedication ceremony .
you mean the whole building?
we're taking the overload just fine .
well , shut it down right away .
i can't do that without an okay from mr. duncan himself .
i'll accept the responsibility .
just turn off the lights !
what about the lights in the tower for the party?
not all the power , just the overload !
yes , sir , mr. roberts !
we better get down to 81 and check the relay systems .
they turned on everything in the whole building .
there's something on 81 .
phone it in , in case the lines to the fire department are out .
i'll be in 81 .
you got it .
get those drapes !
smother it !
try to smother it !
pull it around over here .
put it all over him .
come on !
let's get some water onto that fire .
turn it on !
down , down !
stay low !
call an ambulance for this man .
get on the ball !
call an ambulance !
i want everybody off this floor !
the fire department?
on their way .
get that ambulance .
give me a hand .
get him in the elevator .
all right , try not to touch him .
try to get him by his belt .
this is 81 .
a man's been burned .
get an ambulance .
yes , right away .
call duncan in the tower .
he's got a lot of people up there .
what?
do it now !
it's mr. roberts .
yeah , doug .
we were getting worried about you .
susan's here , senator parker , the mayor and his wife .
they're asking why the greatest architect isn't here .
never mind that .
will giddings has been badly burned .
will giddings burned?
how?
an ambulance is coming , but you better think about . . . . . . getting those people down on the ground floor .
what for?
we got a fire here !
well , i think it's under control , but
well , then why the urgency?
urgency?
if fluky wiring in this building caused that fire . . . . . . fires could break out everywhere !
doug , i think you're overreacting .
i feel sorry for will giddings , but he'll be taken care of .
but i won't concern myself with a fire in a storage room on 81 . . . . . . because it can't possibly affect us up here . . . . . . not in this building .
now , have someone call me when the fire department arrives .
meanwhile , get in your dinner jacket and come up and join the party !
what building's on the corner of montgomery and
oh , jesus !
the glass tower !
what?
the glass tower !
i sure hope that fire's on the first floor .
did you ever fight one in a high rise?
is it as rough as i hear?
like being inside a chimney .
jesus !
how in the hell did they get here before we did?
don't anybody ever stay home anymore?
mike , she's throwing a lot of smoke .
eighty first floor , right?
we've got lobby control , second alarm is in .
set up a forward command .
got it .
chief . . . . . . this is roberts , the architect .
what do we got here , kappy?
fire started , 81 st floor , storage room .
it's bad .
smoke's so thick , we can't tell how far it's spread .
exhaust system?
should've reversed automatically .
it must be a motor burnout .
sprinklers?
they're not working on 81 .
why not?
i don't know .
jim?
yes , sir?
give us a quick refresher on your standpipe system .
floors have 3 and 1 . 5 inch outlets .
gpm?
fifteen hundred from ground to 68 , 1, 000 from 68 to 100 . . . . . . and 500 from there to the roof .
are these elevators programmed for emergencies?
what floor are your plans on?
79 .
my office .
that's two floors below the fire .
it'll be our forward command .
men , take up the equipment .
let's go .
architects !
yeah , it's all our fault .
you know we can't fight a fire in anything over the 7th floor .
but you keep building them as high as you can .
are you here to take me on , or the fire?
what about the 81st floor?
you got everybody out of there?
i wanna see all floor plans , 81 through 85 .
gotcha .
this is what worries me .
those beams and that glass .
chief , 81 has been evacuated , but it doesn't look too good up there .
give me a list of your tenants .
don't worry .
we're moving them out now .
not live ins .
businesses .
we lucked up .
most of them haven't moved in yet .
those that have are off at night .
i wanna know who they are , not where .
what's that got to do with anything?
who they are?
any wool or silk manufacturers?
in a fire , wool and silk give off cyanide gas .
any sporting good manufacturers , like table tennis balls?
they give off toxic gases .
now do you want me to keep going?
one tenant list , coming up .
thank you .
what do we got?
elevator bank , central core .
service elevators here .
air conditioning ducts , 6 inches .
pipe alleys here?
one , two , three , four , five .
this is south?
south .
have you got any construction on 81?
anything that can blow up , like gasoline , fabric cleaner?
i don't think so .
good .
i'll be up on 81 .
for what it's worth , this is one building i figured wouldn't burn .
neither did l .
and they're celebrating .
a party .
what party?
where?
in the promenade room .
300 people .
why didn't you get them out?
why don't you go talk to duncan?
he ain't listening to me .
i will .
here he is now .
this is duncan .
a battalion chief?
i'll watch out for him .
thank you .
ted , take your men down to check that hallway .
jack?
jack , how bad?
i don't like the looks of it .
it's running the ceiling .
work it around .
up there .
i'll be up topside .
right .
jack . . . . . . watch yourself .
keep it high .
looking for me , chief?
if you're duncan .
i am .
everything under control?
gotta move these people out of here .
now , just how bad is it?
it's a fire , mister , and all fires are bad .
you're not familiar with the many modern safety systems . . . . . . we have designed into this building .
we've got them all .
it's your building , but it's our fire .
now get out .
i don't think you're listening .
a fire on 81 can't reach up here , not in this building .
i'll do it .
hold it , hold it .
do you want me to pull rank with the mayor?
with a fire , i outrank everybody here .
one thing we don't want is a panic .
i could tell them , but you ought to .
just make a nice , cool announcement to all your guests . . . . . . that the party's being moved down below the fire floor .
now .
patty , you and susan stay right here where i can find you .
now , don't leave this table .
you , i wanna talk to .
did you change any of doug's electrical specifications?
i most certainly did .
for god's sake , why?
the reason should be obvious , especially to you .
we've got a fire .
if it was caused by what you did , i'll hang you out to dry .
and then i'm going to hang you !
would you please stop playing?
stop playing , will you?
ladies and gentlemen . . . .
ladies and gentlemen , may i have your attention?
it seems that we have a small fire . . . . . . in one of our storage rooms . . . . . . 50 floors below .
i assure you there's no danger .
but in accordance with the fire department's orders . . .
. . . a purely precautionary procedure . . .
. . . we're going to move the party down to the lobby for a while .
and we'll be serving cocktails and champagne in our continental room .
but i promise you , dinner will not be delayed .
now if we can all move to the elevators . . . .
now , ladies and gentlemen . . . . . . there's no reason to rush .
senator parker , you and your party .
it's really all right .
stay here .
i'll be right back .
lisolette !
frank !
lisolette !
how's it going , chief?
better get ready .
kappy , get the floor plans on 82 .
we got problems .
fire lapping?
are your com lines tested?
phone jacks on every floor .
i'm plugging into your pa system .
no sweat .
emergency setup?
battery powered standby system .
splice these lines into our two way communications van .
sure .
no problem?
no problem .
how long will this take?
a minute .
not bad .
here's our problem .
the fire's lapping up through the windows .
get down !
get down !
what was that?
come on !
the ceiling's going !
men trapped !
we need help !
bring a line !
pull them out , pull them out !
pass the fire hose !
pass it along !
battalion two to forward command .
urgent !
forward command , go ahead .
explosion on 81 , fire headed toward elevator banks !
we need more crews up here fast !
they need relief on 81 .
hit it .
they're on their way .
done !
tell duncan to stop those tower room people . . . . . . from using that express elevator , or somebody'll get killed .
ring in a third alarm .
i want some rescue squads and some choppers here .
we may need them to get those people down .
come on , park .
i'll be on 81 .
the fire's moving toward the main shaft .
use the scenic elevator .
don't overload .
i don't like how you talk to me .
you drunk?
not yet .
then get out of my way !
you didn't talk like this before .
running over budget and out of money .
did you ask me then to shave $2, 000, 000 off our electrical costs?
shut up and help these people !
let me ask , father in law  excuse me .
did you encourage other subcontractors to cut corners?
where did you save the other 4, 000, 000 in doug's original budget?
please !
please !
hold everything .
ladies and gentlemen , i'm sorry .
move back into the promenade room . . . . . . and we'll take you down by the scenic elevator .
now these express elevators can be activated by fire .
and with the probability of short circuits . . . . . . the cars might stop on the floor where the fire is .
so please , we'll use the scenic elevators over there .
for god's sake , get out of there !
please , back !
it looks bad , jack .
it is .
i got a couple of men hurt .
the fire's spreading .
i got a third alarm in .
what about this ceiling?
must have just happened .
i'll check the other corridors .
firemen , let's pull it down before it falls down .
bring it out !
take it down !
empty all the water out .
chief , it's out of control .
bring in another line !
get another tank !
angela?
angela?
phillip?
phillip , open the door !
what ideas can i use upstairs . . . . . . to explain where i've been all this time?
well , what you might do is just . . . . . . walk right up to him and say , " j. d. , i'm sorry for the delay . . . . . . but my secretary had an urgent personal problem .
what happens if he asks what the problem was?
he won't .
you know what astonishes me?
what?
you make love with a girl . . . . . . and there's no visible evidence .
nothing to mark the event .
look at you .
you look like you could be going to church .
in this outfit?
i love you .
did you leave a cigarette burning?
that's not a cigarette .
jesus !
get some towels .
stuff them under the door .
dan?
right .
what'd they say?
help's on the way .
there's nothing to worry about .
we'll just sit tight and wait till they get here .
i won't panic .
not to worry , baby .
please , just join the end of the line .
oh , no , ma'am .
please .
but i can't find my daughter .
she's here somewhere .
they're aware of that .
she's wearing a purple dress .
i've got to find her !
i promise , they'll find her .
now , only 12 at a time .
i'm sorry .
that's it .
we'll be in the next group , maybe .
it won't be too long .
what's she doing on 87?
forward command?
i wanna speak to jernigan .
harry .
jernigan .
what?
damn it , man !
you should've sent a man up there !
how do you expect her to hear a phone call?
she's deaf !
sure , the kids can hear !
i don't know , maybe they were in the shower when you called .
you stay there .
i'll get them down !
all my men are committed .
i need fresh crews , damn it !
we'll send them right up .
still got people on 87 .
i'll get them down .
i'll give you a hand .
turn your face away .
there never were any firemen , were there?
i said that to make it easier on you .
i switched off the phones .
there's no way to call out .
nobody knows we're up here .
well , i always did want to die in bed .
nobody's going to die .
at least they'll never find out about us , will they?
i used to run the 100 in 10 flat .
don't go !
i'll be back with the whole fire department .
you all right?
the mother and children are in there .
don't worry .
we'll get them out .
wait !
please , mrs. mueller !
please stay back .
what do you think?

it'll take hours to get everyone down .
those of us with stout hearts and trim waistlines should use the stairs .
that's 135 floors .
all downhill .
it's closer than they told us .
let's try the south exit .
that might be clear .
carlos !
yes , sir .
help us get this thing open .

i'll call security .
yes , sir .
battalion 38 responding to fourth alarm .
where are those choppers , kappy?
navy's been alerted .
why do they make these goddamn things so heavy?
you want it easy , chief?
they should design a survival suit for us like for football players .
who pays to see us play?
let's go to work .
i need two men up the stairwell to the tower .
the door's jammed .
i want it cleared .
okay , you got it .

we were supposed to have fire drills , but nobody ever told me anything .
they said we would have fire drills .
but they never did .
it's going to be all right .
it's going to be all right .
you all right?
you know , i had a . . . .
i got up , but i'll have trouble getting down .

come on , let's go .
chief o'hallorhan?
inside , security phone on the right .
get me chief o'hallorhan .
i'm trying to get through now .
can't we go down?
the fire's below us .
we gotta go up , underneath the promenade room .
come on !
tim , get that phone .
check your ventilating systems over here .
i'll send up another truck company .
pull this ceiling , and vent that other side .
it's the copter air control officer .
thank you .
jack , i know you've been hitting it .
i'm getting relief for you and your men .
who am i speaking to?
chief flaker , sir .
u. s. navy , air rescue .
it's about time .
we need your rescue choppers .
right away .
our communications will be near the forward command center .
no , too dangerous .
stay out of those elevators .
then , sir , we'll just trot up the stairs .
you'll just trot right up to 79 , huh?
standing by in the lobby .
thank you .
this ain't gonna help any !
they won't hear us in there .
there's 300 people !
it's a fire door .
it's over 2 . 5 inches thick .
i could crawl through the duct .
will we be able to go with you?
that leads to a pipe shaft that's 135 floors straight down .
phillip , take care of these ladies .
they're your responsibility now .
all right , i'll tell him .
how is it on 65?
they're containing it .
well , it's still below us .
let's take a look .
okay , watch the electrics .
come here !
the master generator's blown .
the backup should've kicked on .
see what's holding up our starters .
what happened?
where the hell are we?
security , this is duncan .
have the main breakers gone?
the whole system's failed .
what's the last report on the firemen getting here?
are they on their way?
hold on to me a second .
hold on !
christ !
that's one of our men !
oh , god !
go down by rope .
better get it .
sir?
we'll rappel down to 65 and use the top of that elevator as an exit .
why not pry open the doors at this level?
i don't think so .
i can't make it .
i'll fall .
i know i'll fall .
then you better go first .
that way , when you fall , you won't take any of us with you .
let's go to work .
check all rooms in that corridor .
check this room .
tear it down .
see?
just like we taught you in training .
open it up .
of course i read you !
i don't know where he is , but if i see him , i'll tell him .
must be an easier way to get to a fire .
not for us .
where've you been?
we had trouble getting here .
the navy flight commander needs you .
just walk 65 floors down?
only five .
a freight elevator on 60's running auxiliary power .
got it controlled?
getting there .
you men stay here with the chief .
tell him i'm on my way .
oh , mike . . . .
this one of your men?
dan bigelow . " nope .
must be a civilian .
okay to o'hallorhan .
he's on his way .
look !
there's another one there !
carlos , give me that security phone , will you?
how'd you get in here?
i'll give it to you later .
give me o'hallorhan .
anybody'll do .
listen , the south stairwell is blocked .
cement , for chrissake !
can you send somebody up to break it loose?
they're on their way?
how?
oh , my lord , elke .
my poor cat .
she's still in the apartment .
i'm sure the fire didn't get up that high yet .
she'll be all right .
hello , ma'am .
hello .
how're you doing?
we're fine .
glad to see you .
that's the door right there .
it's blocked with cement .
we're gonna have to blow that thing .
mrs. mueller?
it's mr. roberts !
mrs. mueller !
phillip !
we hear you .
we're gonna blow this door .
get everybody clear .
you've got about 30 seconds .
understood?
understood !
okay , ma'am , let's get down there .
out of the way .
please go back .
they're gonna dynamite this door .
step back , please .
we're blowing the door .
okay , get down low .
what kind of explosives are you using?
it's plastic c 4 .
blow a hole in anything .
here , shine this on the bag for me .
that's it .
keep it up here .
is there gonna be a bang?
nothing for you to worry about , baby .
you'll be safe .
okay , everybody ready?
good going , brian .
you all right?
i'm james duncan .
can we get down that way?
no , not a chance , sir .
the stairway below is completely gone .
everyone , listen !
hold it down !
listen !
i've been informed that there's no possibility . . . . . . of using this stairway to get out .
now , i'm sorry .
patty . . . .
there's still a chance we can get out of here .
didn't you hear what my father said?
you can't get out that way .
are you coming or not?
if you have to wait for permission to save your own life , go ahead .
i'm getting out .
roger , you . . . .
come on !
come on !
let's go .
you guys , hose the ceiling .
you two , in there !
i guess you thought i stood you up .
it crossed my mind .
you sure you're all right?
those helicopters , they'll get us out of here , won't they?
sure they will if there's not too much wind .
some party .
can i get you anything else?
the choppers are here , but the winds make a landing attempt too risky .
get some men on top of the peerless building . . . . . . and get a breeches buoy to the promenade room .
we can't shoot a line that far in this wind .
why not shoot it from a chopper?
i'll get right on it .
doc?
chief , the ceiling fell in on him .
by the time i got to him , he was covered with hot stuff .
pretty ridiculous spectacle , right?
there's no way down .
thank god you're all right .
oh , roger , what are we gonna go?
i know what i'm gonna do .
get quietly drunk .
if you're responsible for this , i know what you must be feeling .
you don't know the meaning of the word .
responsible?
feeling !
you know about responsibility .
it's a family trait .
duncans are big in that department , at least on the surface .
that's not fair !
i don't think it's wrong to feel a sense of duty .
sometimes , when you turn the exact same phrase . . . . . . iift an eyebrow in the exact same way . . . . . . i see and i hear your father .
the two of you , one !
like a big tree and a little tree in its shade , where the acorn fell .
roger , i came over here to you because i thought you might need me .
right now . . .
. . . what i need most . . . . . . is this .
i promised myself if i ever saw you again , i'd make a full confession .
no , but thank you .
but you don't know anything about me .
but i do .
you're penniless . . . . . . you have no villa in the south of france . . . . . . no antiques coming , no paintings .
but , harlee , i don't care .
i'm a cheap tinhorn .
a two bit con man .
not cheap .
maybe unsuccessful .
but you see , your heart isn't in it .
how can you cheat people effectively . . . . . . if you don't enjoy cheating them?
i came here to sell you 1 000 shares in greater anaheim power and light !
is it a good investment?
there is no greater anaheim power and light .
only the certificate i had printed .
i think you'd have admired the artwork .
beautiful engraving .
i'd like to see it .
it's in my jacket .
i took the jacket off .
it was needed elsewhere .
you see what i mean?
i can't even deliver a phony stock certificate .
did you hear what i said?
every word .
then tell me you're shocked . . . . . . or at least disappointed .
but i'm not .
you must be !
harlee , i'm not .
i'll be right back .
give me a few minutes with doug , will you , dear?
sure .
will giddings is dead .
he died 20 minutes ago .
oh , boy .
i wonder how many more will be dead tomorrow?
i thought we were building something . . . . . . where people could work , live and be safe .
if you had to cut costs , why didn't you cut floors instead of corners?
now listen .
any decisions that were made for the use of alternate building materials . . . . . . were made because i , as a builder , have a right to make those decisions .
if i remain within the building code , and goddamn it , i did !
oh , here we go again !
the building code .
come on .
that's a standard cop out when you're in trouble !
i was crawling around up there .
the duct holes weren't fire stopped !
corridors without fire doors and the sprinklers won't work .
and an electrical system that's good for what?
i mean , it's good for starting fires !
where was i when all this was going on?
because i'm just as guilty as you and that goddamn son in law of yours !
what do they call it when you kill people?
who is it?
chief o'hallorhan .
what happened?
part of the central corridor just blew .
we've got in the fifth alarm .
the helicopters?
it's too windy .
we'll set up the breeches buoy on the peerless building .
what can we do to help?
move your combustible material away from the window .
okay , gotcha .
there's nobody on those drapes .
let's get them .
jake , give me a hand .
did you reach her?
the phones are all out .
just a little while longer , and we'll all be home together .
if only i could have talked to her .
let her know we were thinking of her .
told her how precious she is to us .
she's still such a child .
she doesn't even know where i keep the key to the safety deposit box .
how will she be able to get into it?
i mean . . .
. . . if she should have to .
the things you think of .
do you wanna help me?
here he is .
the wind's down a little .
we're gonna try for a landing .
get roberts .
get 10 people on the roof .
have the rest stand by .
we're gonna start airlifting .
will do .
put these over there .
give me a pad of paper and a pencil .
give me that brandy snifter too .
doug , are they going to land?
they're gonna try .
we'll send the kids out first , then the women .
number these up to 100 or so .
high rise roulette .
high rise roulette .
that's right .
there may not be time to tell you  there will be .
i'll go tell everybody .
pass those out when you're ready .
there'll be a lot of wind up there , so everybody stay in one group .
come on .
stay back , stay back !
look out !
roberts !
roberts !
chief o'hallorhan wants to speak to you .
all right , make way .
coming through , coming through !
here he is now .
roberts , i know those pilots are dead , and l
god , it was just awful up there .
listen , our best chance now is the breeches buoy .
i told my two firemen to knock out a window .
we'll try to shoot a line from a chopper .
hey , one of you guys got a pair of clippers?
sure , what do you want them for?
i want to try something .
step back .
the firemen are gonna knock out the windows .
step back and you won't get hurt .
may i have your attention , please?
we've activated a gravity brake on that outside elevator .
there's no power to bring it back up , but at least we can get 12 people out .
which 12?
the same group that was up on the roof and two additions .
the woman who saved the children's lives and a fireman !
i want a trained man in there .
all right , let's move it out !
marge !
take this .
take it !
you can get out !
go on .
what are you doing?
i'm sorry .
i want you out of here .
so you can stop worrying about me?
what about me worrying about you?
it's the only way you can help me .
help me .
if you asked me to go to the north pole . . . . . . or even the cliffs of mendocino , i'd go .
what if i ask you tomorrow?
please .
ma'am , i'll take her .
thank you .
come on , phillip .
i'll never let you go anywhere without me again .
i don't want to .
ever again .
i'll meet you in the lobby .
i'll be waiting .
we're still a lady short .
you've gotta go .
i don't want to leave you .
honey , i'll make it .
i promise you .
have i ever broken a promise to you?
good luck , honey .
please .
all set , everyone?
okay , here we go .
out of sight !
yeah , it's coming .
let's untie this , take it off , pull in the rest of the line !
okay , come on .
let's get it through .
all right , hold it right there !
bring in another 20 feet of that main line .
that's it .
all right , bring in a little more !
that's it .
hold it now .
brace yourselves .
watch your heads !
grab it !
take it back and secure it !
all right , let it go !
let it go !
all right , go on !
take it out !
okay , take ahold .
how about the main line?
secured?
good !
chief !
explosion above 110 . . . . . . blew the elevator off its track .
it's hanging by a cable .
how many people in it?
loaded .
i'd say about 12 .
what're you gonna go?
flaker .
flaker !
sir?
can you give me a chopper with a winch and some cable?
have them pick me up on the peerless building .
got it .
try and get a hitch on that elevator .
drop it down to the deck by the chopper .
mommy , mommy !
i won't cry if you won't cry .
it's all right .
yeah , take it up out of there .
pull it .
come on !
tie it over there .
okay , let her go !
look out below !
come on .
okay , that's it .
all right !
there's one in there !
come on !
pull it in !
all right , let's haul that chair in !
come on !
that's it !
all right , keep it going !
all right , hold it right there .
who's next in order?
i am .
i am !
come ahead !
i can't do that .
yes , you can .
i can't !
yes , you can .
oh , god !
don't let go of me !
don't let go of me !
don't let me fall !
don't let go !
don't let go of me !
get me out , please !
hold it right there .
okay , lower the cable .
grab that hook !
steady .
what about the torch?
lash it tight .
this is o'hallorhan .
we read you , chief .
pick me up with the hook . . . . . . and set me down on the scenic elevator .
then you'll pick up the elevator and gently set it down on the street .
can you handle the weight?
i think we can handle it .
we'll find out in a hurry .
watch it !
take it away !
how much time do we have?
i wish i knew .
goddamn it , jim , you built the place !
i just don't think that all of us are gonna make it .
well , i guess i'm next .
i don't suppose you'll let me stay .
come on .
i'll see you soon .
i love you .
let it go !
you think this'll hold it?
it'd better .
we have to cut the elevator cable .
what's your number?
68 .
47 .
here , mrs. ramsay , you'll be all right now .
you'll be all right .
tell my husband i'm all right .
tell him i'll be all right .
i will .
and i'll see him at home later .
i will .
let's go .
oh , my god , you're all right !
thank god you're all right !
watch the ladder .
hey , mike . . . . . . deputy wants to see you .
mike , we've been checking the situation in the promenade room .
we figure they've got 17 or 18 minutes left , if that .
it'll take more than 3 hours to get them down by breeches buoy .
they'll die up there if something's not done .
we might have the answer .
johnson's a structural engineer .
tell the chief your calculations .
the structural strength of the joists in that room . . . . . . could definitely withstand the explosion .
what explosion?
chief , we've got the copter ready .
wait a minute .
we'll handle that .
just get back to your job .
yes , sir .
what explosion?
we can blow the tanks two floors above the promenade room .
they hold 1, 000, 000 gallons of water .
that's enough to drown the fire .
you're crazy .
mike , it's the only way .
you could kill everybody up there .
i don't think so .
you don't think?
when you take into account the stress factors , the design
wait a minute .
just hold it .
we've already made the decision .
someone has got to go up there , rig the charges and blow them .
there's only two people qualified for that .
you and conners .
they just brought conners down .
he's on his way to the burn center .
under the circumstances , we can't order you to go up there .
i'm just laying it out for you .
but you . . . .
you see how it is , don't you?
how do i get back down?
oh , shit !
the women are gone .
we are going next .
you've all got numbers .
and you're gonna take your turn .
and if it's any consolation . . .
. . . i'll be the last one out of here along with my son in law .
it's out of control .
and it's coming your way .
you got about 15 minutes .
now , they want to try something .
they wanna blow those water tanks above you .
they think it'll kill the fire .
how are they gonna get the explosives up here?
they'll find some dumb son of a bitch to bring it up .
hang on , i'll tell them .
they want to put out the fire by blowing the water tanks above us .
we'll eat a lot of water and concrete , but if they don't try it , we'll burn .
the fire's out of control .
they think we got maybe 15 minutes .
this way , some of us might survive .
we got no options .
come on .
let's go .
get that line .
get off !
you crazy bastards !
drop this line !
let go of me !
drop the line .
it's not gonna work .
it won't hold everybody !
get off !
get off !
get the hell out of there !
go !
get off .
chief .
we lost the breeches buoy .
it was panic up here .
it's under control now .
i'll try and set down on the roof .
i'll need you up there .
i know where to place the charges , but i don't know how .
i know how .
see you up there .
you'll have to tie yourselves down .
ropes , tablecloths , belts . . . . . . anything you can find !
carlos !
yes , sir .
get some knives .
there we go .
for god's sakes , carlos .
don't tie yourself up to a lot of glass .
that's the '29 .
try it .
it's okay .
doug . . .
. . . i never thought this could happen .
sure .
how much time you think we got?
ten minutes , maybe less .
we'll have to blow the floors as well as the tanks , you know .
all right .
this is your detonator .
you're running instantaneous .
i'm running delayed .
here you go .
this is your explosive .
this is the timer .
later on , after you throw the wire . . . . . . we'll plug it and splice it into the timer , set it , and it blows .
set your explosive like this .
take your detonator , pull the plug .
toss it .
got it?
i got it .
good luck .
see you later .
okay , thanks .
here you go .
what will you set it for?
five .
i think we can make that .
that's it .
tie yourselves down , goddamn it !
you'll never make it through there .
how much time?
three and a half .
here .
here .
i'm burning up !
let's go !
fireman?
bob !
bob !
excuse me .
she was in the elevator with you .
the fine looking lady .
mrs. mueller .
have you seen her?
i'm sorry , she's dead .
lisa !
lisa !
claiborne !
what?
i didn't want you to see him .
you know , there's nothing any of us can do to bring back the dead .
all i can do now is pray to god . . .
. . . that i can stop this from ever happening again .
i don't know .
maybe they just ought to leave it the way it is .
kind of a shrine to all the bullshit in the world .
you know , we were lucky tonight .
body count's less than 200 .
one of these days , they'll kill 1 0, 000 in one of these firetraps .
and i'll keep eating smoke and bringing out bodies . . . . . . until somebody asks us . . .
. . . how to build them .
okay .
i'm asking .
you know where to reach me .
so long , architect .
