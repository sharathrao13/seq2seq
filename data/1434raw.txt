jungle .
damu headquarters .
stoners .
a lot of murder investigations lead here .
one way in , one way out .
thought we were going to eat .
don't ever come here without me .
i'm serious .
for your safety .
how'd you get a golden pass?
i treat them fair .
they know if they cross the line , i tax that ass .
what's that , up there?
they flipping pigeons to signal i'm here .
what's up , bone?
what's up?
what's up?
it's all good .
i appreciate what you did for my nephew .
for sure .
for sure .

i'm sick of it .
i can't stand him !
who are they?
nobody .
i got them under my thumb .
