what he's trying to say , reuben , is that we didn't plan it .
reuben , itjust it happened .
it's like the story of the hippo .
i'm not familiar with that story .
the hippopotamus , he is not born going , " cool bean , i am a hippo .
no way, jos .
so he tried to paint the stripe on himself to be like the zebra , but he fool no one .
and then he tried to put the spot on his skin to be like the leopard , but everyone know he is a hippo .
so at certain point , he look himself in the mirror , and hejust say ,
hey , i am a hippopotamus , and there is nothing i can do about it .
and as soon as he accepts this , he live life happy .
happy as a hippo .
you understand?
i'm gonna kill you !
reuben !
no , reuben !
leuban , this is not the way !
you're gonna be fine , reuben .
no , i'm not gonna be fine .
i'm not gonna be fine at all .

'cause this ship has sailed .
hey , tina .

i'm just gonna run to the men's room .
i'll join you .
i heard about your honeymoon .
just terrible .
i knew that girl was a slut the second i met her .
yeah , well , you know , it's kind of complicated .
hey , don't make excuses .
she's a dime store hooker , and she always will be .
just put it behind you .
speaking of which , you ever hear of a guy named leland van lew?
um , leland van lew .
yeah , yeah .
australian guy , right?
um , was on the cover of forbes last year?
exactly .
yeah , he started one of those high tech , modem scrotum ,
god only knows what they do companies anyway .
jesus christ .
they want to take the company public , and if he wants to remain the c. e. o. of a publicly held company , guess what he needs .
life insurance .
bingo was his name .
all right , you want me to check him out?
yeah .
there's just one catch .
yeah?
this van lew has a reputation as a cowboy .
apparently , he's one of these extreme sports nuts .
so it's a long shot , but if you can pull this thing together , [ zips ]
might be a lot of dough in it for us , maybe a little extra bonus for you , help you with those house payments .
all right .
well , let's make sure he checks out first and you see?
this is why you're the only one i can trust with these jobs .

but you're playing judas .
judas .

uh huh . lsn't that like the point of community theater?
whatever , reuben .
so i'm going on a date with polly .
all right !
where are you taking her?
i don't know .
some restaurant in the east village .
she left the address on my machine .
how could you let polly pick the restaurant?
well , i had no choice .
she called me , like , seven times ... to confirm and then cancel and then confirm again .
why?
what's wrong with letting her pick the place?
you've got irritable bowel syndrome , dude .
lf she chose an ethnic restaurant , you're gonna be running to the bathroom every five seconds .
oh , my god .
you're right .
thank you .
you know , i doubt it'll get this far , but if she turns out to be easier than i thought , there's something you need to know .
i'm not a virgin , sandy .
no , not technically , but times have changed since you were last single .
now , listen , when i'm making out with a girl for the first time ,
i like to give her a little spankin '.
what?
nothing violent .
you just tap her real light right on the tushy and say ,
hey , i'm your daddy .
i'm your daddy .
listen to me .
what are you doing?
i'm blotting the grease .
that's the best part .
let me see that .
listen , don't be shy .
it's just a little tap .
it's like saying , " boop , i'm your daddy .
i'm not gonna tap her .
brings 'em right back to childhood .
trust me , they're putty in your hands after that .
i gotta tell you , i'm really excited about this .
really .
i feel like this could be one of those ... defining moments of my life or something , you know?
yeah , i actually think it's not gonna work out , but i'm pulling for you , reub .
just pray to god she doesn't go ethnic .
the place didn't sound ethnic .
what was the name?
al hafez .
so when did you live in morocco?
ln the late '90s .
i bounced around to a bunch of different places over the past few years .
oh , yeah?
like where?
oh , god , where?
let's see , austin , lstanbul , sri lanka , portland ,
costa rica , buffalo , a couple other places .

oh , yeah , completely .
no , remember?
you were the person who broke oh , my god !
i can't believe you remember that .
oh , of course .
you were like the greatest delegate in model u. n. history .
i guess i did manage to pass a few resolutions .
are you okay?
'cause you're sweating pretty profusely .
yeah , no , i'm fine .
i always react this way to spicy food .
okay .
yeah , but i love it .
i can't believe you're not married .
i mean , even when we were kids ,
i always saw you as that guy that would settle down at a young age, you know?
you were always kinda like an old young guy .
yeah , well , it just hasn't happened .
but , uh , what about you?
you ever gotten close or
to the whole marriage thing?
oh , god , no .
no way .
no, yeah , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no .
i'm not really big on the whole , um , long term commitment thing .
mm hmm .

i recognized you from the forbes cover .

ls this the service elevator?
yeah .
i don't think we'll have a problem with this insurance business .
sure , i take chances , but , hey , you can't build a successful business without the occasional risk .
oh , of course .
what i'm trying to determine are the kinds of risks you actually do take .
i only take the calculated ones .
trust me , i plan on being round for ages yet .
well , i know we'd really love to give you a policy if we can make it work .
we'll make it work , sport .
great .
so , uh , what are we doing on the roof?
i'm just gonna do a bit of a base jump .
here .
keep the walkie on channel 1 3 , all right?
i don't know what you're talking about .
a base jump .
a free fall from an inanimate object .
i always carry me chute in case i find a good launching point .
oh , no .

reuben feffer .

apparently , lisa" s doing wonderfully down there in st. barts ,
selling villas , happy .
that's good for her .

nah .
not important .
lisa's reuben's wife .
mm .
oh .
she left him for another man on their honeymoon .
oh .

i think i'll take the check .
what?
well , you know , your dad seems really nice .
yes .
a man of few words .
yeah .
hey , look , i just want you to know i was gonna tell you about lisa .
i just , um i was embarrassed , and i ...
i guess 'cause i hadn't seen you for so long and oh , it's so okay .
i understand .
no , i was an idiot .
i should've just told you the truth right from the start .
reuben , i'm really i'm not upset .
but when did this happen?
two weeks ago .
two weeks ago?
oh , my god !
are you okay?
well , it was a pretty big shock .
i walked in on her , on lisa , with , um , a scuba instructor on the first day of our honeymoon .
they were still wearing their flippers .
anyway [ chuckles ]
oh .
i mean ohh !
hey , reuben !
uh , it's polly ...
prince .
um , i don't know if you have any plans tonight , but if not , you should swing by , uh , 37 gansevort street ... around 9 : 00 if you can make it .
you know , it's no big deal , but it could be fun .
so , you know , think about it .
okay , so , um , i'll see you later ... or not .
i mean either way .
and oh , if you do come , you should wear comfortable shoes .
that is if you come .
but you totally don't have to .
i mean , i might not even be there .
i am so glad that you came .
yeah .
i wore my comfortable shoes just like you said .
so what are we doing?
oh , crap .
this place is a total secret .
it is the best underground salsa club in new york .
yeah , you know , i'm not really a big dancer .
i don't know
oh , come on .
you know what?
it's easier than it looks .
oh !
oh , okay .
there you go .
just feel it in your legs .
all right .
okay .
ow !
sorry , sorry .
that's okay . just step on my feet a little less than that .

this is my friend reuben .
hey .

hey , you mind if i dance with the beautiful lady?
um , i guess not .
yeah .
all right , thanks , man .
hey .
hi !
i think i might take off .
really?
yeah .
are you having a bad time?
no , no , no !
i'm just not into this whole dirty dancing thing .
what do you mean , dirty dancing?
i saw that movie .
i know that's what you and that , uh , spaniard were doing .
whoa .
wait a minute .
first of all , he's cuban , and that wasn't dirty dancing , that was just salsa .
okay , it's just i'm just really , truthfully not the kind of guy ... that's ever gonna be into these kind of clubs or any
okay , reuben , you know , then tell me , what kind of guy are ya?
what kind of guy am l?
what do you mean?
well , up until now , you haven't exactly been the portrait of honesty , so just come clean , okay?
just tell me who you are .
i hate spicy food .
i knew it !
yeah , i don't like it at all .
i have a mild case of l . b. s. and what is that?
lrritable bowel syndrome .
what?
lrritable bowel syndrome .
oh , god .
that's terrible .
um , what else?
look , the thing is ,
i assess risk for a living , so i know that i have a . 01 3 % chance ... of being hit by a car on my way home , or a one in 46, 000 chance of falling through a subway grate .
really?
so i try to manage that risk by avoiding danger ... and having a plan and knowing what my next move is , and i guess you don't exactly live your life that way .
no , i do it i do it a little differently .
yeah , which is great .
but i'm not gonna ever be a dirty dancer , and i don't eat food with my hands , and i really like you , but i just don't think this is gonna work out .
i just have to go pee .
okay .
just kidding !
oh !
funny .
do it , do it
do it again
do it again
let" s do it again
i wanna do it again
sometimes the rain
hey .
hi .

gettin" down with the sounds around
oh , the smell of the morning flower
as we pass away the hours
i wanna do it again
do it again do it [ stops ]
ow !
did you just spank me?
no !
i don't no .
mm mmm .
are you sure?
'cause it felt like you just swatted me .
no , no , you
i have a little crick in my wrist .
you just felt that little
i was just do you hear that?
really?
yeah .

well , i got it out .
yeah .
yeah .
oh , wow .
this is incredible .
oh , man .
oh , god .
oh , yeah .
oh , no !
no , no .
you can't be done yet .
come on , reuben , focus .
you have to last at least five minutes here .
four minutes , 27 , 26 , 25 .
two minutes 20 , 1 9 , 1 8 , 1 7 .
come on .
you can do it .
5 5 , 54 , 53 , 52 , 51 oh , god !

fifty?
yeah , 50 !
whoo !
let it rain !
i tell ya , i think i might end up marrying this woman .
really?
after one night?
did you spank her?
yeah , i tried , but i don't think she liked it .
yeah , some women find it offensive .
lceman !
i did not sleep with him out of charity .
you weren't interested till you found out his wife boned some other guy on their honeymoon .
that's not it .
he is a kind , decent , solid guy .
i've never been with anybody like that .
still sounds like a charity boning .
hi .
thank you .
do you have to use the word " bone " every time?
i use it when it's appropriate .
have you ever heard of a guy shouting out " 50 " when he orgasmed?
yeah .
yeah?
okay , so throw pillows go in this cabinet here .
oh , you don't you don't sleep on these?
no , no , they're ... decorative .
for who?
what do you mean?
you're the only one who sees them , but you don't sleep on them .
then you take them off the bed every night , put 'em in a box , take them out of the box .
i just don't understand the point .
i don't know .
i mean , lisa thought they looked nice .
oh .
i see .
yeah .
yeah .
i don't see what the big deal is .
they make the bed look nice .
hey !
what are you doing?
that's goose down !
i'm liberating you .
try it .
no !
i'm not gonna just one stab .
come on .
see how you feel .
come on !
this is ridiculous .
it's not ridiculous .
it's not like driving a knife into a pillow is suddenly gonna make me feel
wow .
that feels really good .
huh?
right?
yeah !
what did i tell you?
you know what?
you're right .
come on .
bigger one .
what is the point of these things really?
no point .
they're stupid .
ha !
ha !
ha !
ha !
ha !
ha !
ha !
i mean , what , am i running a bed and breakfast?
not anymore .
you know how many minutes a day ...
i spend getting throw pillows on and off the bed?
how many?
four minutes in the morning , four minutes at night .
that's eight minutes of my life .
i figured it out .
it's 56 minutes a week .
that's nearly two days of my life a year i spent putting pillows on and off a stupid bed !
ha !
ha !
whoa !
whoa !
whoa !
whoa , whoa , whoa !
wait , wait , wait .
you hit mattress .
oh , yeah .
you know what?
i really gotta go .
i'm late .
shoot .
what's wrong?
you lose your keys again?
no , they're just not where i left them before .
hey , why don't you use that key finder i bought you?
reuben , i don't ...
i think it could help . need the stupid key finder !
all right .
anyway , i was thinking i'd come meet you .
really?
i thought you hated dirty dancing clubs .
no , it's just salsa .
it'll be fun .
i'll watch .
hey , what's that noise?
nothing .
it's the key finder , isn't it?
no , it's so not the key finder .
yes , it is !
it is not the key finder .
i'll see you later .
bye .
yes , it oh !
how?
hey , reuby tuesday .
cmo ests?
yeah .
doin 'all right .
you know what?
actually , me no ests too good, javier .
i want you to stay away from polly , all right?
find yourself another dance partner .
why?
why?
because she and i are a couple , all right?
yeah , we're dating .
and i'm not gonna let some big shot salsa king ... sweep in with your mambo moves and your erik estrada look ... and come in and try to take her away , because i've had that happen before and it's not gonna happen again .
reuben , i am gay .
hey , i don't care what you what?
i'm homosexual .
my boyfriend hector , he plays the keyboards in the house band .
oh .
hey , you think maybe you could give me some salsa lessons?
huh .
you hated it .
no , i don't .
it's just it's very graphic for a children's book .
the boy with a nub for an arm .
well , that one has a moral .
you know , to teach kids they gotta be careful when they're playing with fireworks .
right .
no , and and i think it's brilliant , by the way .
seriously .
uh huh .
i mean , like , you really convey ... the pain and the fear , and i love the little doggy too .
but and i don't mean this in a bad way .
right .
just what were you thinking?
so i put all the risks and rewards into the program , okay .
right . which helps me finalize my recommendations .
leland van lew . " ooh !
base jumping !
that is supposed to be so much fun .
that should be on the rewards side .
it's one of the most dangerous activities a human being can do .
really?
have you done it?
yeah .
have i parachuted off the top of a building?
no .
uh huh .
no?
no .
so how do you know what it's like?
i don't .
huh . lnteresting .
would you like some more bulgogi?
sure .
yeah?
yeah , thanks .
i actually like this .
yeah , it's good .
you do?
now you look like a pro racquetballer .
how's that shirt fit , all right?
uh , yeah , it's fine .
you know , i was thinking maybe we can just sit and talk .
i'm not really a big raquetball player .
no worries .
we'll just get up a bit of a sweat .
have a few giggles .
so i've been running the numbers , and i gotta say ... things aren't looking too good from our end .
bollocks !
geez !
leland , i mean , it's not just the base jumping .
it's the heli skiing , [ yells ]
volcano luging , shark diving .
bottom line is , unless you drastically alter your lifestyle , we won't be able to insure you .
reuben , i came to you for a reason .
i was told that you had more imagination ... than any of the other blokes in the big firms that you analyze the man and not just the numbers .
i guess i was wrong .
are you trying to manipulate me?
of course i am .
but i wanna hold onto me company .
oh !
i'll tell you what .
i'm gonna be in nantucket at the end of the month .
you'll come up and be my guest aboard the " roo shooter .
aboard the what?
my sailboat .
i'll take you for a bit of a sail , give you a chance to really get to know me .
and i guarantee you by the end of the weekend , you'll know what a safe bet i really am .
yeah , you know what?
uh , you're bleeding pretty bad .
yeah , i think i've swallowed a tooth or something .
oh !
no .
got it .
your serve .
so i tell leland we can" t insure him .
he responds by inviting me up to nantucket for some death ray sailing challenge .
really?
yeah .
oh , we gotta go do that .
i've never been to nantucket .
you wanna come?
i would well , can ls that rude?
ls it all right if i invite myself?
no !
that'd be great .
okay , good .
so you're actually gonna commit to something in advance .
yeah oh .
oh , my god .
okay , yeah , i am .
i think that would be really fun .
whoa , whoa , whoa .
what?
what are you doin '?
i'm i'm gonna have some nuts .
no .
you don't eat mixed nuts at a bar .
everybody knows that .
what are you talking about?
okay .
let's say , uh , conservatively , i don't know , 1 7 people eat these nuts on a given night .
okay? lf they" ve been here for even two weeks , we" re talking about ... 238 people who dipped their dirty hands into that bowl .
dirty why are their why are their hands dirty?
on average , only one out of every six people wash their hands when they go to the bathroom .
yeah , so when you think you're innocently eating a little bar snack , you're actually ingesting potentially deadly bacteria from about 39 soil handed strangers .
i mean , people wonder why they get e. coli poisoning or salmonella or hepatitis , when all they gotta do is look at the snack bowl at their local watering hole .
i'm not being neurotic .
no .
it's an absolute hot zone in there .
how could you have eaten those?
l l l i mean , i made such a compelling argument .
i like to live life on the edge .
oh .
thank you .
yeah .
you never know .
reuben , i mean , you don't have to do this .
i don't care that you that you don't know how to dance .
no , i thought i'd give it one last try .
hey, javi .
hey , reuben .
you ready?
uh huh .
what is happening?
what?
what are you doing?
tzzz !
yi !
yi , yi , yi , yi , yi , yi , yi !
i don't even know where that " yi , yi , yi , yi , yi , yi " thing came from .
it was just awesome .
holy shit !

i'm back .

i'm not your girlfriend .

i missed you .
reuben i missed you too , but i mean , come on !

i moved on .
i'm in a relationship .

yeah .
she doesn't even call herself your girlfriend .

she just doesn't like the phrasing .
oh , okay .
okay .
then let mejust ask you this .
are you really gonna spend the rest of your life with her?
i don't know , lisa .
because i'm ready to do that with you , reuben .
i made a mistake and i took you for granted , but i promise you that i will never , ever hurt you again .
i love you , reuben .
you know what?
i think , um
i think you should , um , go stay with your parents , okay ,
'cause i gotta be out of here in a week .
what are you talking about?
where are you going?
where am i going?
i'm going into the house , remember?
the house that i bought for us to live in .
well , then , let's let's do it together .
let's go move into our house .

no .
i can't
i don't even know what to say right now , okay?
so
okay .
lf you wanna get back together with her, just let me know .
no , i'm not planning on getting back together with her .
i wouldn't be seeing you if i was planning it's cool , you know?
you guys are married .
she came back .
all right , polly
how's it coming with herb lazare , d. d. s.?
hello?
i haven't even gotten into it yet .
i'm i'm still working on van lew .
wait a minute .
i thought you decided on van lew two weeks ago .
we're presenting to aflac on wednesday .
polly , can you hang on a second?
just hang on one second .
no , i kinda have to go .
you better not be bonus hunting on me , reuben .
bonus hunting?
stan , the man's career is on the line .
i owe it to him to give him a thorough analysis .
all right .
i'm going to barbados with my mistress for the weekend .

yeah , not good enough .
she" s a killer !
hey , hey , hey , hey
i just can't believe she came back .
can we please just focus for a second?
i'm almost finished .
what's next?
polly's career prospects .
risky .
she's writing a children's book where kids get maimed .
yeah , see , i think her lack of career is actually a positive ,
'cause she'd have more time to spend with the kids .
you" re skewing the numbers in polly" s favor , reuben .
why are we even doing this?
because i'm confused , sandy .
i mean , my goddamn wife shows up on my doorstep ... wanting to get back together , polly's freaking out .
i just wanna make sure i'm making the right decision .
i don" t see how putting these two girls in the riskmaster" s gonna help you make up your mind .
mmm .
lnteresting .
what" s it say?
polly .
polly?
yeah .
no way .
you should just cut your losses and get back with lisa .
nah , i checked it , like , three times .
the program says she's the safer choice .
whatever .
by the way , dude , is your health okay?
i mean , you're looking kind of thin .
uh , no .
polly's been making me eat ethnic food , so i've been throwing up a lot lately .
cool .

i'm sorry .
i'm on the phone .

oh , no , l" m okay .
i don" t think i have my sea legs yet .
l" il be out in a sec .

oh , god .
so i know we haven't been seeing each other that long , but i really feel like it's time we take things to the next level , and i'd like you to consider moving in with me .
why don't we just why don't we just move in together?
oh , yeah .
we're gonna have ourselves a tussle .

i learned a lot about myself .
i've learned that i have no career , i'm flaky , i like ethnic food .
polly , would you let me explain this?
uh huh .
lisa came back , and i , you know , i've been trying to figure things out .
what are you figuring out , reuben?
just about us and our future .
future?
what are you talking about?
what future?
reuben , come on !
this is a fling , you know?
come on .
what , did you think we were gonna get married?
whoa !
maybe ...
i was gonna ask you to move in with me first .
oh , my god .
you expect me to move to the suburbs with you?
reuben , are you insane?
whoa !
why is that so crazy?
people do that all the time .
they have kids , they they they make plans , they get married , they buy houses .
you know what , though?
that's you , reuben .
you do that , right?
that's what you do .
i don't live my life that way .
ls your lack of a plan that different than my plan?
i don't i don't have a plan .
yes , you do !
you're on the non plan plan .
i am not on a non plan plan !
you are too !
i've never met anybody more afraid of committing to anything .
i mean , you were a senior delegate at the model u. n. , polly .
what the hell happened to you?
whoa !
wahoo !
come on , you mother !
you can do better than that !
i've been living my life , okay?
l" ve been in good relationships and l" ve been in shitty ones , and i've moved a lot , and i've been happy and i've been sad , and i've been lonely , and that's what i've been doing , which is a lot more than i can say for some freak who thinks ... he's gonna get the ebola virus from a bowl of mixed nuts .
those nuts have pee on them !
it's common sense !
oh , trust me , that is so far beyond common sense , reuben .
you don" t understand what i grew up with .
i had a mother who made me afraid of everything .
okay , well , big deal , reuben .
my dad had a whole second family .
what?
yeah , on long lsland .
a wife and kids and a golden retriever .
a second family?
whatever .
hey , you know what?
i'm , uh , glad i saw that .
polly i am .
cause you know what?
i'm gonna make this really , uh , easy for you , reuben .
i have , um i have no interest ... in getting married and moving to the suburbs .
and , obviously , that's something that's really important to you .
so here's what i think your new plan should be .
i think you should get back together with lisa , move into your house , and move on with your life .
and and , uh , i think you guys will be really happy together .
oh , dear lord .
whoa !
you" re not making myjob any easier , leland .
ah , come on , reub .

your sorry eyes
they cut through the bone
they make it hard

reuben feffer .
reuben , stan .
change of plan .
the meeting with van lew's board and the aflac people's moved to 4 : 00 .
4 : 00?
i don't know if i can do that .
what the hell is wrong with you?
get your ass over here !
good evening , folks .
uh , l" m sandy lyle , and l" ve got a very special announcement .
please note that in tonight" s performance , [ stops ]
in addition to playing the role ofjudas ,
l" il be playing jesus as well .
thank you very much and enjoy the show .
sandy , what are you doing?
wonsuk is playing jesus .
lt" s cool . l" m playing dual roles .
give me your crown , okay , wonsuk?
screw you , sandy !
you" re a has been .
no one even cares you were in that stupid movie .
oh , no .
oh , shit !
aah !
judas is biting me !
what just happened in there?
i am a professional , reuben , and i'm not gonna put my reputation on the line for a group of freaking amateurs .
lt" s always the same story with you , huh , pal?
you did this one movie a hundred years ago .
from then on , you thought you were better than everybody else .
why don't you let go?
move on with your life .
it's not about what happened in the past ... or what you think might happen in the future .
it's about the ride , for christ's sake .
there's no point going through all this crap ... if you're not gonna enjoy the ride .
and you know what?
when you least expect it , something great might come along something better than you even planned for .
you were funny as hell playing those bagpipes , though .
did i ever tell you that?
l i don't think i've ever heard you speak before , mr. feffer .
so , reuby , we" re gonna grab a bite after your work thingamajigy?
no , lisa .
i shouldn't have asked you to come down here .
i'm not getting back together with you .
what are you talking about?
w why?
why?
you screwed a scuba diving instructor on our honeymoon .
i mean , what kind of cold , heartless bitch ... would do that to someone they love?
i'd have to be an idiot to get back together with you after that .
oh , and by the way , i destroyed all your little throw pillows .
yeah , because throw pillows suck , okay?
they serve no purpose .
they're purely decorative .
dude , that was incredible .
you're the one who told me i should get back together with her .
reuben .
whatever you do , don't ever take my advice again .
your dad totally put it in perspective for me .
i was barely famous back then , and i'm never gonna be famous again .
what about your e !
true hollywood story?
the e !
channel doesn't even know we're making this show .
what do you mean?
i hired dustin and vic myself .
and i was gonna try and sell it to the network when l" m done .
you mean you're doing an e !
true hollywood story on yourself?
sandy , that's so that's the stupidest thing i've ever heard .
i know .
i'm such a loser .
look , i need you to do something for me that's really , really important .
so you gotta promise me just this one time you won't screw it up .
reuben , i'm your wingman .
whatever it is , i will not let you down .
your reuben's proxy?
what the hell does that mean?
now , he's dealing with a personal situation , so he asked me to fill in .
now , you gotta relax .
i'm a professional actor , and these dudes will never know the difference .
i can't freaking believe this is happening .
be quiet , 'cause i'm ... tryin 'to prepare .
i'm gonna vomit .
i am so sorry for the delay , folks , but one of our senior analysts , reuben feffer , had his spleen burst just a few moments ago , and
that's not good .
ls he gonna be all right?
well , god willing , leland .
but anyway , be that as it may , we have mr. feffer's associate here , mr. sanford lyle , who" s been briefed on the case and will present reuben" s recommendations .
thank you , stanley .
i just need a little bit of water .
as you know , this is a highly complex case .
um , let me see here .
yeah , on the plus side ,
leland's blood pressure is pretty solid .
and he's , uh , at a decent weight , and he looks pretty damn healthy , right?
and he" s a sexy guy , right?
and he is sexually active in the community .
polly?
j. f. k. , please .
let's not bullcrap each other .
on paper , van lew is one of the riskiest sons ofbitches alive .
but , people , we cannot sum up a man's life with a bunch of numbers on a computer screen .
all right , we all need to look into our hearts and go ,
do i think this dude is gonna die in a few years or not?
ls old leland here gonna fight off a man ... with the last name " reaper , " first name who goes by the last name " reaper , " first name " grim "?
or will this base jumping , crocodile wrestling , shark diving , volcano luging , bear fighting , snake wrangling , motocross racing bastard die?
and the answer is no , friends , which is why myself ,
reuben feffer , stan ... and all of us here at lndurby and friends ... are willing to lay our asses on the line ... and proudly recommend that leland van lew ... receive fifty million dollars in life and health ... and automobile insurance ... for a duration of no less than 20 years .
hey , what do you think , guys?
are you that kid from crocodile tears?
you're goddamn right i am .
i thought so .
lmpressive presentation .
he's insured .
yeah !
bloody ripper !
congratulations .
love ya , son !
rodolfo , wait !
i'm so sorry !
reuben , it's too late .
i have to be on a plane in , like , 45 minutes .
i don't think you really wanna leave here .
you have no idea what i want .
you left rodolfo behind .
does that mean anything to you?
look , i made a mistake , all right?
i should've never put you in the riskmaster .
truth is , no matter what happened on our honeymoon , you're much riskier than lisa could ever be .
yes .
right .
that's why it's not gonna work out between us .
reuben , you are a nice , safe , conventional guy .
just it's not gonna work out .
i don't think that's who i really am .
it is , reuben .
that's okay .
what do i have to do to prove it to you?
huh?
hey !
huh?
what are you oh , my god .
hey , look .
look , i'm eating nuts .
what the hell are you doing?
those nuts aren't even dirty .
hey .
oh !
since we've been together , i've felt more uncomfortable , out of place , embarrassed ... and just physically sick than i have in my entire life .
but i couldn" t have gone through all that
i couldn't have thrown up 1 9 times in 48 days ... if i wasn't in love with you .
maybe you were right .
maybe this is just a fling .
but if you get on that plane and you go to cincinnati ... or tanzania or wherever you're going , we'll never know if it could've been something more .
oh , no .
no , no , no .
no .
oh , no .
n no .
oh , reuben .
please don't eat those .
no , really .
oh , god .
i don't want you to go away , polly .
i'm not gonna marry you , reuben .
i don't wanna get married .
i just wanna take you to dinner ... sometime this week .
can i pick the place?
solid .
excuse me .
hi .

oh , no , no , no , no , no .
