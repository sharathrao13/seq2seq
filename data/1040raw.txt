royal tenenbaum bought the house on archer avenue in the winter of his 35th year .
over the next decade he and his wife had three children and then they separated .
are you getting divorced?
at the moment , no ... but ... it doesn't look good .
do you still love us?
of course i do .
do you still love mom?
yes , very much , but your mother's asked me to leave and i must respect her position on the matter .
is it our fault?
no .
no .
obviously , we made certain sacrifices as a result of having children , but , uh ... no , lord , no .
then why'd she ask you to leave?
i don't really know anymore .
maybe , uh , i wasn't as true to her as i could've been .
well , she said ...
let's just drop it shall we , uh , chassie?
they were never legally divorced .
thank you , pagoda .
etheline tenenbaum keptthe house and raised the children and their education was her highest priority .
yes , i'll hold , please .
thank you .
i need $187 .
write yourself a check .
bene .
si .
grazie mille .
she wrote a book on the subject .
chas , chas !
richie !
uh , the gentleman in the blue cardigan , please .
thank you .
i have a two part question .
go ahead .
chas tenenbaum had , since elementary school taken most of his meals in his room standing up at his desk with a cup of coffee to save time .
in the sixth grade , he went into business breeding dalmatian mice which he sold to a pet shop in little tokyo .
he started buying real estate in his early teens and seemed to have an almost preternatural understanding of international finance .
he negotiated the purchase of his father's summer house on eagle's island .
hold it , chassie .
hold it right there .
what are you doing?
you're on my team .
there are no teams .
the bb was still lodged between two knuckles in chas's left hand .
margot tenenbaum was adopted at age two .
her father had always noted this when introducing her .
this is my adopted daughter margot tenenbaum .
she was a playwright , and won a braverman grant of $50, 000 in the ninth grade .
she and her brother richie ran away from home one winter and camped out in the african wing of the public archives .
hi , eli .
you said i could run away , too .
no , i didn't , and don't tell anyone you saw us .
they shared a sleeping bag and survived on crackers and root beer .
fouryears later
margot disappeared alone for two weeks and came back with half a finger missing .
richie tenenbaum had been a champion tennis player since the third grade .
do you copy , anonymous?
he turned pro at 17 and won the u. s. nationals three years in a row .
he kept a studio in the corner of the ballroom but had failed to develop as a painter .
up ... up ... right ... perfect .
pagoda?
on weekends
royal took him on outings around the city .
put it out there .
these invitations were never extended to anyone else .
richie's best friend , eli cash , lived with his aunt in the building across the street .
he was a regular fixture at family gatherings holidays , mornings before school , and most afternoons .
the three tenenbaum children performed margot's first play on the night of her 1 1th birthday .
they had agreed to invite their father to the party .
what'd you think , dad?
mmm ... didn't seem believable to me .
why are you wearing pajamas?
do you live here?
he has permission to sleep over .
well , did you at least think the characters were well developed?
what characters?
this is a bunch of little kids , uh dressed up in animal costumes .
good night , everyone .
well , sweetie ... don't be mad at me .
that's just one man's opinion .
chlldren : / happy birthday to you / / happy birthday to you ... /
he had not been invited to any of theirparties since .
in fact , virtually all memory of the brilliance of the young tenenbaums had been erased by two decades of betrayal , failure , and disaster .
go , mordecai .

i've been instructed to refuse any further charges on your room account and to direct you , in writing to please vacate the premises by the end of the month .
what about sing sang?
i owe her $100 .
royal had lived in the lindbergh palace hotel for 22 years .
can you pay her in cash?
uh uh .
he was a prominent litigator until the mid '80s when he was disbarred and briefly imprisoned .
no one in his family had spoken to him in three years .
read it back to me so far , pietro .
new paragraph .
richie had retired from professional tennis at 26 .
his last match had been widely discussed in the media .
your friend richie .
end of letter .
for the pastyear , he had been traveling alone on an ocean liner called the cote d'lvoire and had seen both poles , five oceans the amazon and the nile .
the crickets and the rust beetles scuttled
among the nettles of the sage thicket . " 'vamanos , amigos , 'he whispered
and threw the busted leather flint craw
over the loose weave of the saddle cock and they rode on in the friscalating dusk light .
eli was an assistant professor of english literature at brooks college .
the recent publication of his second novel ... ... had earned him a sudden , unexpected literary celebrity .
well , everyone knows custer died at little bighorn .
what this book presupposes is ... maybe he didn't .
let me ask you something .
why would a review make the point of saying someone's nota genius?
you think i'm especially nota genius?
i know w ...
you didn't even have to think about it , did you?
well , i just don't use thatword lightly .
i have to go , eli .
margot?
uh huh .
may i come in , please?
how are you , my darling?
margo was married to the writer and neurologist
raleigh st. clair .
i'm fine , thank you .
you need to eat something .
may i make you dinner?
no , thank you .
she was known for her extreme secrecy .
for example , none of the tenenbaums knew she was a smoker , which she had been since the age of 12 .
nor were they aware of her first marriage and divorce to a recording artist in jamaica .
she kept a private studio in mockingbird heights under the name " helen scott .
she had not completed a play in seven years .
17 october , third examination of dudley heinsbergen .
all right , dudley make yours like mine .
raleigh's next book was on the subject of a condition he called " heinsbergen syndrome .
where's that red one going to go?
done .
good .
very good .
my goodness .
how interesting .
how bizarre .
dudley suffers from a rare disorder combining symptoms of amnesia , dyslexia and color blindness .
he has a highly acute sense of hearing .
there is also evidence of ...
i'm not color blind , am l?
i'm afraid you are .
ari , fire alarm !
let's go !
out you go !
let's go !
uzi , emergency !
let's go !
uzi ... what did i just say? !
look alive !
fire !
chas's wife rachael was killed in a plane crash the previous summer .
what about buckley?
it's too late .
you forgot him .
buckley !
buckley !
no elevator !
there's a fire .
go , go !
go , go , go , go , go !
go , go , go , go , go !
chas and theirtwo sons , ari and uzi were also on the flight and survived as did their dog who was discovered in his cage several thousand yards from the crash site .
four minutes , 48 seconds .
we're all dead , burnt to a crisp .
over the last six months he had become increasingly concerned with their safety .
we left buckley .
it doesn't matter .
etheline became an archaeologist and had overseen excavations for the department of housing and the transit authority .
apropos of my question regarding l 40 slash l 9 adjustments ... um ...
she taught a bridge class twice a week with herfriend and business manager , henry sherman .
it would probably be advantageous for your marital status to be legally established as single in light of the circumstances .
what do you mean?
i mean for tax purposes .
but i thought ...
etheline ...
yes?
will you marry me?
i ...
i love you , uh ...
did you already know that?
no , i didn't .
since herseparation from her husband she had had many suitors ...
... but had not considered a single one until this moment .
this isn't really a tax issue , is it?
that's true , uh ...
i don't know why i put it that way .
let me think about it , henry .
hello .
please tell mr. royal this is the pagoda .
lobby .
thank you , dusty .
you're welcome .
good morning , jerry .
hmm ...
oh , there's a call for you , mr. tenenbaum .
who is it , frederick?
a mr. pagoda .
what do you got?
the black man asked her to be his wife .
no shit?
what did ethel say?
she think about it .
i don't like the sound of this one damn bit , pagoda .
i mean ...
lord knows
i've had my share of infidelities but she's still my wife .
and no damn two bit , chartered accountant is going to change that .
hi .
hey , pagoda , give us a hand , huh?
chas?
what's going on?
we got locked out of our apartment .
did you call a locksmith?
uh huh .
well , i don't understand .
did you pack your bags before you got locked out or how did you ...?
it's not safe over there .
excuse me for a moment .
what are you talking about?
the apartment .
i have to get some new sprinklers and a backup security system installed .
but there are no sprinklers here , either .
well , we might have to do something about that , too .
okay .
lsn't this fun , huh?
lsn't this great?
feels like we're camping .
when are we going home?
huh?
hey , look at this .
pretty cool , huh? / who am i supposed to be? /
who put that in here? / ... look at me /
/ what am i supposed to be? /
okay .
well , i will see you boys in the morning .
good night .
good night .
good night . / look at me /
you know what?
i think i'm going to sleep in here with you .
that way ... ... we can all be together .
/ oh , my love / / oh . /
what kind of side effects can be expected?
well , there are a number of possibilities .
severe nausea and dizziness are standard .
a certain percentage of patients may also experience seizure .
you mean , like flopping around on the floor and everything?
in some cases .
you have a visitor , my darling .
who is it?
it's me , sweetie .
raleigh says you've been spending six hours a day
locked in here , watching television and soaking in the tub .
i doubt that .
i don't think that's very healthy , do you?
nor do i think it's very intelligent to keep an electrical gadget on the edge of the bathtub .
i tie it to the radiator .
well , it can't be very good for your eyes , anyway .
chas came home .
what do you mean?
he and ari and uzi are going to stay with me for a little while .
why are they allowed to do that?
i don't know exactly but i think he's been very depressed .
so am l .
so are you , what?
but why is this necessary?
'cause i'm in a rut , and i need a change .
hang on .
( vince guaraldi trio's
christmas time is here " playing )

and are they all right?
it's hard to say .

his name is royal tenenbaum .
you told us he was already dead .
yeah , well , now he's really dying .
ready .
print it .
i am very sorry , margo .
that's okay .
we're not actually related , anyway .
true .
i'd like to send a response , please .
yes , sir , go ahead .
i received your message .
i'm coming home as soon as possible .
who do i see about that?
the ship's porter arranged for richie to disembark at halifax and transfer to a third class state room on board the queen helena destined for the eastern seaboard .
his trunks would not arrive for another 1 1 days .
hey , baumer .
do you mind if we get a picture with you?
not at all .
he had made a request for his usual escort the one from his days on the circuit to meet him at the pier by way of the green line bus .
hi .
as always , she was late .
/ i've been out walking / / i don't do too much talking these days / / these days / / these days i seem to think a lot / / about the things that i forgot to do ... / / and other times , i ... /
stand up straight .
let me get a look at you .
what's so funny?
well it's nice to see you , too .
that night , etheline found all of her children
living together under the same roof for the first time in 17 years .
where's your dad?
the next morning , richie woke at dawn .
he had decided birds should not be kept in cages fed mordecai three sardines , and set him free .
i've missed the hell out of you , my darlings .
well , you know that , though , don't you?
i hear you're dying .
so they tell me .
i'm sorry .
well , i've had a good run .
you don't look so sick , dad .
thank you .
what have you got?
i've got a pretty bad case of cancer .
how long you going to last?
not long .
a month , a year?
about six weeks .
let me get to the point .
the three of you and your mother are all i've got and i love you more than anything .
ho ho !
ho ho .
chas , let me finish here .
now , i've got six weeks to set things right with you and i aim to do it .
will you give me a chance?
no .
you speak for everyone?
i speak for myself .
well , you've made your views known .
let somebody else do some of the talking now .
what do you propose to do?
i can't say , really .
um , make up for lost time , i suppose .
first thing i want to do is take you out to see your grandmother , at some point .
i haven't been out there since i was six .
i haven't been out there at all .
i was never invited .
well , she wasn't your real grandmother and i never knew how much interest you had , uh , sweetie .
anyway , you're invited now .
thanks .
you know , rachael's buried out there , too .
who?
my wife .
oh , that's right , isn't it?
well , we'll have to swing by her grave , too .
uh , i'll be right back .
chas .
chas .
can i see my grandsons?
why?
because i finally want to meet them .
don't give me that guff .
i think we'll pass .
pagoda ... where's my havelina?
i'll say good night to you now , children .
dad .
thank you , my sweet boy .
i'll contact you in the next 12 hours with further instructions .
look at that old grizzly bear .
hello , ethel .
good evening , sir .

royal , this is henry sherman .
hey , lay it on me , man .
how do you do?
not too well .
i'm dying .

i don't know .
i can't tell .
yeah , me neither .
he wrote me a letter .
he says he's in love with you .
what are you talking about?
that's what he said .
i don't know how we're supposed to take it .
hang on .
hello .
sugar , it's eli .
hey , baby , give me a second .
what are we doing , eli?
oh , i just got to pick something up .
don't repeat that , by the way .
about richie .
it was told to me in confidence , and , you know ...
good .
now just remove the loose soil and note the decomposition levels .
i'm sorry to interrupt your work .
don't be silly .
come on .
i just want to apologize for the other day when i proposed to you .
why?
i thought it was very sweet .
i know i'm not as accomplished as some of the men you've been involved with .
uh , franklin benedict , general cartwright , and your ex husband .
oh , that's ridiculous .
but , but , i feel ...
i can offer just as much as them .
i know i went about it backwards , but ...
henry , i have no interest in franklin benedict or doug cartwright i never did and as far as royal's concerned , he's the most ...
henry?
henry , are you all right?
yeah , i'm fine .
i'm fine .
anyway , let me know when you make up your mind .
henry , wait a second .
i'm sorry , i'm very nervous .
th that's okay .
oh , thank you .

buckley .
buckley , sit .

i'm royal .
have you heard of me?
i'm very sorry for your loss .
your mother was a terribly attractive woman .
thank you .
which one are you?
ari .
uzi , i'm your granddad .
hello .
i'm sorry we haven't gotten to know each other .
i don't get invited around very much .
what do you think of that , by the way?
oh , you ... you don't have to say anything .
it's kind of a " fuck you " to the old man , i guess .
how's your daddy?
fine .
you think so , huh?
how often has he got you working out?
16 times a week .
do me a favor .
tell him you want to meet me .
but we just met .
no , we didn't .
look , i'd like us to have a relationship but we have to pull some strings to make it happen .
now , here's what you tell him .
you say ...
well , i bet mom would have wanted us to meet him before he died .
wouldn't she?
don't you think?
she was a tough old broad , wasn't she?
i wouldn't know .
excuse me .
come on .
oh , that's right .
we've got another body buried here , haven't we?
uh , hold on .
take some of these .
come on .
so what do you think of this big , old black buck moving in up there?
who?
henry sherman .
you know him?
yeah .
is he worth a damn?
i believe so .
what happened to your finger?
uzi , shh .
it's okay , i'll tell you .
i'm adopted .
did you know that?
well , i am .
when i was 14 , i went to find my real family .
they live in lndiana .
all right , now , just set one of them hickory trunks right up top there , sister maggie .
did you try to sew it back on?
wasn't worth it .
hell of a damn grave .
wish it were mine .
it's a shame , isn't it?
what?
well , you probably had another good two or three years of competitive play in you .
probably .
i had a lot riding on that match , you know .
financially and personally .
why did you choke out there that day , baumer?
mr. gandhi leads 40 15 .
that's 72 unforced errors for richie tenenbaum .
he's playing the worst tennis of his life .
what's he feeling right now , tex hayward?
i don't know , jim .
there's obviously something wrong with him .
he's taken off his shoes and one of his socks and ... actually , i think he's crying .
i think you're right .
who's he looking at in the friends 'box , tex?
that's his sister , margot and her new husband , raleigh st. clair .
they were just married yesterday , jim .
oh , yes .
i've never seen anything like this .
neither have l .
strange day out here at windswept fields .
i kind of disappeared after that , didn't l?
yeah .
but i understood .
i know you're not very good with disappointment .
you still got that little bb in your hand , chassie?
why did you shoot me?
it was the object of the game , wasn't it?
no .
we were on the same team .
were we?
well ... you sued me .
twice .
got me disbarred .
i don't hold it against you , do l?
and how is it possible for mr. tenenbaum to withdraw these funds without your written authorization?
objection , your honor .
damn it , i ...
why don't you leave the objections to me , royal?
because i started the corporation when i was a minor .
so , my father was the primary signatory on most of my accounts .
he also stole bonds out of my safety deposit box when i was 14 .
you think you could start forgiving me?
why should l?
because you're hurting me .
come on .
were you in prison?
kind of .
minimum security .
i got jacked by the lrs .
should we split?
yes , sir .
no , call me mr. tenenbaum .
okay .
no , i'm kidding ; call me pappy .
okay .
come on , let's shag ass .
well , just let me know ifyou need somebody to talk to , okay?
i like raleigh very much .
i know he's a lot older than you are and you two are having some problems but ... anyway , maybe i can help .
okay .
thanks .
hey , baumer !
all right !
all right !
ha !
oh , shit !
oh , jesus .
by the way , i heard about that letter you sent to eli .
you dropped some cigarettes .
those aren't mine .
they just fell out ofyour pocket .
oh , my lord , look at you .
come in .
did you tell margot about that letter i wrote to you?
why?
did she mention it?
yes , i did .
why would she have repeated that , i wonder?
well , i would ask you the same question .
rightly so .
what'd you say?
hmm?
what?
i didn't say anything .
when?
right now?
i'm sorry ; don't listen to me .
i'm on mescaline .
i've been spaced out all day .
did you say you're on mescaline?
i did , indeed .
very much so .
how often do you , uh ...?
i'm worried about you , richie .
why?
well , actually , margot is , for some reason .
but i did find it odd when you said you were in love with her .
she's married , you know .
yeah .
and she's your sister .
adopted .
where are my encyclopedias?
they've been placed in storage .
well , damn you .
you're taking my encyclopedias .
th this is humiliating .
i'm sorry .
would you like to make a complaint in writing?
where am i supposed to go?
you're turning me into a damn hobo .
i'd be happy to make a reservation for you
at another hotel .
you son of a bitch .
frederick .
hello there , dusty .
hello .
could you spot me a quarter?
of course .
richie?
hi .
it's your dad .
i think he's very lonely ...
lonelier than he lets on maybe lonelier than he even realizes .
have you spoken to him about this?
briefly , and he agreed that we ...
i'm sorry , maybe i'm a little confused here .
what are you suggesting?
that he come here and stay in my room .
are you out ofyour mind?
no , i'm not .
anyway , i think that he'd be much more comfortable here than he would ...
who gives a shit?
i do .
you poor sucker .
you poor , washed up papa's boy .
all right , let's not get out of hand .
please , don't get in the middle of this , mr. sherman .
this is a family matter .
don't talk to him like that .
call me henry .
i prefer mr. sherman .
call him henry .
why?
i don't know him that well .
you've known him for ten years .
as your accountant , mr. sherman , yes .
where are you going to sleep?
i'm just going to camp out upstairs .
we brought our sleeping bag ...
uzi !
we don't mind , dad .
we like him .
who , pappy?
pappy "?
he can sleep in the room above us .
ari , it's not your decision .
nor is it yours .
well , he's already up there .
what? !
i think he's asleep because of the medication he's on but i ...
i guess you can wake him up and throw him out ... if mom says it's okay .
get out .
all right .
let me just collect my things .
would you mind handing me my cane , richie?
let me see , where's my suitcases?
i'll get 'em .
oh , thanks .
oh !
dad !
mom !
grab me a nembutal , will you , son?
are you okay?
what the fuck you care?
oh , my goodness .
pagoda?
call doctor mcclure .
take a breath and hold it .
now cough .
his condition is stable .
the attack was just a side effect .
i recommend you push fluids and continue the stomach cancer medication .
can we move him?
absolutely not .
for how long?
we'll have to wait and see .
is he going to be all right?
that depends .
is he a fighter?
yeah .
then that's the best we've got .
pagoda's in possession of a parcel containing my will and some instructions for the funeral including my epitaph , for when the time comes .
proofread it for me before they carve it on the headstone , okay?
okay .
i never did stop loving you , by the way .
do you believe that?
not really .
you look terrific .
that dress is stunning .
thanks .
/ tears that angels cry ... / / and the dark and all the sky ... /
lights out , old man .
i thought i'd read for a while , chas .

i'm right in the middle of a sentence .
well , you'll have to finish it in the morning .
them's the rules .
chas?
good night , my boy . / when the oneyou love says good bye / / sing a lullaby / / dee dee dee , dee dee , dee dee / / dee dee dee , dee dee , dee dee ... /

he's your dad , too , chas .
no , he's not .
yes , he is .
you really hate me , don't you?
no .
i don't .
i love you .
well , i don't know what you think you're going to get out of this but believe me , whatever it is , it's not worth it .
chas ...
i don't want to hurt you .
i know what you and the boys have been through .
you're my brother , and i love you .
stop saying that !
what's that jackass doing?
i know you , asshole !
did eli send you that?
mm hmm .
he always sends me his clippings .
what for?
i think he just likes the encouragement .
he's done it for years .
he used to send me his grades in college .
that's ridiculous .
how long do you intend to stay here?
i don't know .
are you ever coming home?
maybe not .
you're joking .
no .
well , i want to die .
raleigh , please ...
have you met someone else?
i couldn't even begin to think about knowing how to answer that question .
i don't like the way you're treating raleigh .
what are you talking about?
you don't even know him .
well , i've met him , and i don't think he deserves ...
stay out of it .
you're two timing him with that bloodsucker
eli cash .
now , that's just not right , damn it .
you used to be a genius .
no , i didn't .
anyway , that's what they used to say .
richard , i know you're terribly close to margot and probably understand her better than anyone .
may i confide in you?
okay .
i believe she's having an affair .
i'm utterly devastated .
i ... don't know where else to turn .
will you advise me?
i don't know .
what do you want to do?
i don't know .
perhaps , uh ...
find the guy and get him?
well , no , i thought we could ...
who do you think it might be?
i don't know at the moment .
let's look at the actuals , okay?
i agree with you a hundred percent .
that's why we have marketing grids .
hey .
what do you say we go down to little tokyo and get some fireworks?
what do you need?
nothing .
i see you got them , uh , crunching numbers for you .
please don't come in this room .
chas has those boys cooped up
like a pair ofjackrabbits , etheline .
he has his reasons .
oh , i know that but you can't raise boys to be scared of life .
you got to brew some recklessness into them .
i think that's terrible advice .
no , you don't .
we take boxing and self defense classes .
i'm not talking about dance lessons .
i'm talking about putting a brick through the other guy's windshield .
i'm talking about taking it out and chopping it up .

how are you feeling?
i'm having a ball .
scrapping and yelling and mixing it up .
loving every minute with this damn crew .
i want to thank you for raising our children by the way .
okay .
i'm not kidding .
you always put them first , didn't you?
i tried to .
lately i feel like maybe i didn't do such a great job .
goddamn it , don't do that to yourself .
i'm the one that failed them .
or , anyway , it's nobody's fault .
plus , that it doesn't ...
why didn't you give a damn about us , royal?
why didn't you care?
i don't know .
i'm ashamed of myself .
i'll tell you one thing , though ... you got more grit , fire and guts than any woman i have ever met .
what ... what are you smiling about?
nothing .
no , wha ... what's so funny?
nothing .
it's these little expressions ofyours .
i don't know what you're talking about but i'll take it as a compliment .
you're true blue , ethel .
you really are .
how's your love life?
none ofyour business .
i'd like you to talk to royal about us ifyou don't mind .
i don't think the timing's right for that , henry .
well , i'd agree if i thought he was really going to die in six weeks but i don't .
well , i hopeyou're right .
actually , i don't believe i'll join you tonight .
i'll call you in the morning .
she said that?
great .
got the sucker on the ropes .
can i ask you something , hank?
okay .
are you trying to steal my woman?
i beg your pardon?
you heard me , coltrane .
coltrane?
what?
did you just call me " coltrane "?
no .
you didn't?
no .
okay .
but if i did ... you wouldn't be able to do anything about it , would you?
you don't think so?
no , i don't .
listen , royal ifyou think you can march in here ...
you want to talk some jive?
i'll talk some jive .
i'll talk some jive like you've never heard .
oh , yeah?

nothing .
mmm .
hello , i'm calling in regards to a dr. mcclure yes at colby general .
the name of the patient is royal tenenbaum .
hmm ...
is that a tic tac?
how much is he paying you?
i don't know what you're talking about .
well , i grew up with the tenenbaum family , you know .
right .
across the street .
mm hmm .
they've fallen on hard times now , haven't they?
i can't say no .
this is bullshit .
change it , huh?
what did you do to your hand?
uh , nothing .
can we get somebody over here to kill these mice for us?
no .
they belong to chas .
or anyway , he invented them .
well , get him to stick them in a fucking cage or something .
etheline ... mind coming up here for a minute , please?
what's cooking , pops?
you'll see .
now , your previous novel ...
yes .
wildcat .

well , wildcatwas written in a kind of obsolete vernacular ...
wildcat ...
wild ... cat ...

james bradley ...
hold on a minute , please .
what's going on?
pagoda has something to say .
he has a cancer .
no , he doesn't .
i know what stomach cancer looks like .
i've seen it .
and you don't eat three cheeseburgers a day with french fries if you got it .
the pain is excruciating .
how would you know?
my wife had it .
not only is there no dr. mcclure at colby general there is no colby general .
it closed in 1974 .
aw , shit , man .
oh , shit , man .
yes , can you send a taxi to 111 archer avenue right away , please?
thank you .
i guess we're back out on the street , huh , pal?
were you part of this , pagoda?
of course he was .
no , well , yeah , he was but , i mean , he wasn't thatinvolved .
where'd you get all these medical supplies?
a guy at st. pete's owed me a favor .
i did some malpractice work for him .
i do have high blood pressure , though .
look , i know i'm going to be the bad guy on this one .
but i just want to say , the last six days have been the best six days of probably my whole life .
immediately after making this statement
royal realized that it was true .
why'd you do this to us , royal?
what was the point?
i thought i could win you back .
and then i thought i could get rid of henry ... and at least keep the status quo .
but we hadn't spoken n seven years .
i know .
plus , uh ...
i was broke .
and i got kicked out of my hotel .
you're a bastard .
good bye , royal .
take it easy on those boys , chassie .
i don't want this to happen to you .
you know , richie , this illness , this closeness to death has had a profound effect on me .
l i feel like a different person , i really do .
dad , you were never dying .
but i'm going to live .
he's not your father .
neither are you .
you son of a bitch !
god .... damn ...
that's the last time you put a knife in me , hear me?
the 375th street y , please .
everyone's against me .
it's your fault , man .
yeah , i know , but damn it , i want this family to love me .
how much money you got?
i don't have .
what , you're broke?
you got to be kidding me .
how are we going to pay for this room?
all right , we'll think of something .
ow .
i'm not in love with you anymore .
i didn't know you ever were .
let's not make this any more difficult than it already is .
okay .
okay , what?
okay , i'm not in love with you , either .
yes , i know ; you're in love with richie which is sick and gross .
do you send my mother your clippings ... and your grades from college?
please stop belittling me .
you never gave me the time of day till i started getting good reviews .
your reviews aren't that good .
but the sales are .
gentlemen ... how much do you already know?
very little , i'm afraid .
would you like to examine the report?
yes .

i'll inform you of my decision at the appropriate time .

he'll probably sleep for several hours and then i'll come back to check on him .
all right?
how are you feeling?
fine , thanks .
are you in any pain?
not really .
why'd you try to kill yourself?
don't press him right now .
i wrote a suicide note .
you did?
yeah .
right after i regained consciousness .
can we read it?
no .
can you paraphrase it for us?
i don't think so .
is it dark?
of course it's dark .
it's a suicide note .
all right , that's enough .
doctor said to let him sleep .
what? !
cover for us , will you , dusty?
yes .
yes , royal .
you've made a cuckold of me .
i know .
many times over .
i'm sorry .
and you nearly killed your poor brother .
what's he talking about?
it doesn't matter .
she's balling eli cash .
oh , my goodness .
may i have a cigarette?
what?
shall i repeat the question?
you don't smoke .
i know that .
and a light .
au revoir .
how long have you been a smoker?
22 years .
well , i think you should quit .
how can i help?
let me look at these forms .
oh , henry .

royal tenenbaum .
i'm afraid visiting hours are over , sir .
wh wh what does it say there they don't want me?
l i'm sorry .
i have to refer you to dr. burrows .
he'll be in tomorrow afternoon .
we could shimmy up that gutter jump over that window ledge and then , uh , pry open that ventilator shaft .
there he is .
richie !
richie .
where's he going?
richie !
well , i have to say he didn't look half bad for a suicide .
attempted , anyway .
thanks . / please / / give me second grace /
/ please / / give me a second face /
/ i've fallen far down / / the first time around / / now i just sit on the ground in your way /
: / now / / if it's time for recompense / / for what's done ... /

hello? / and the clouds will roll by / / and we'll never deny /
w what are you doing in my tent?
just listening to some records .
aren't you supposed to be in the hospital?
i checked myself out .
how many stitches did you get?
i don't know .
you want to see?
/ they seem to stay for day after day / / and won't disappear ... /
jesus . / i tried every way ... /
richie , that looks horrible .
i heard about your ex husband .
desmond?
i guess so .
i didn't get his name .
yeah .
i met him in the ocean .
i was swimming and he came out to me in a canoe .
we were only married nine days .
and i heard about eli .
i know .
poor eli .
anyway , they mostly just talked about you .
they did?
yeah .
i guess that was the attraction , ifyou know what i mean . / she smiled sweetly / / she smiled sweetly / / and says don't worry ... /
i have to tell you something .
what's that?
i love you .
i love you , too .
/ there's no use tryin '/ / you're here / / begin again / / and o'er again / / that's what she said so softly ... /
i can't stop thinking about you .
i went away for a year , and it only got worse and i don't know what to do .
let's lie down for a minute .
/ she smiled sweetly / / she smiled sweetly ... /
this is the sleeping bag we took to the museum , isn't it .
mm hmm . / oh , no , no , no ... /
why'd you do it?
because of me?
yeah , but it's not your fault .
you're not going to do it again , are you?
i doubt it .
/ shewould never say / / where she came from ... / / yesterday don't matter / / if it's gone /
/ while the sun is bright / / or in the darkest night / / no one knows ... /
i think we're just going to have to be secretly in love with each other and leave it at that , richie .
/ good bye , ruby tuesday / / who could hang a name on you? / / when you change with every new day / / still i'm gonna miss you ... /
lobby floor .
thank you , sir .
going up?
yeah .
what floor , sir?
doesn't matter .
so , you're elevator operators now?
yeah , just started .
we'll get a bump as soon as we join the union .
what made you decide to do that?
we're broke .
but in answer to your question
i wanted to prove
i could pay my dues , and whatnot .
i just hope somebody notices .
you asked me why i choked out there that day .
i think i may know the answer and i wanted your advice .
sure .
margot tenenbaum?
yeah .
well , since when?
since always .
does she know?
uh huh .
well , what does she feel about that?
i think she feels confused .
well , i can understand that .
it's probably illegal .
i don't think so .
we're not related by blood .
that's true .
still frowned upon .
but then , what isn't these days , right?
i don't know , maybe it works .
why not , what the hell .
you love each other .
nobody knows what's going to happen , so ...
you know something .
don't listen to me .
i never understood her myself .
i never understood any of us .
i wish i could tell you what to do but i just can't .
that's okay .
no , it's not .
you still consider me your father?
sure , i do .
i wish i had more to offer in that department .
i know you do , pop .
i don't blame you , by the way .
uh , she's a great looking girl and smart as a whip .
mordecai . / stephanie says that she wants to know / / why she's given half her life / / to people she hates now ... /
holy shit .
you came back .
jiminy crickets .
that damn bird must have radar in its brain .
is that true , mordecai?
l i'm not so sure this is mordecai .
what do you mean?
he flew right in here .
this bird has much more white feathers on him .
oh , the son of a bitch must be molting .
oh .
i need your help with something else .
you got it .
what's the situation?
well , um , i think eli maybe ...
hold it .
pagoda , meet me in the lobby .
let's hit it .
i didn't mean right this second , but ... that's okay .
i don't think it was ramses .
i believe it was tootinkamen .
tutankhamen .
tutankhamen?
yes .
tutankhamen .
yes?
hey , richie .
we want to take you to get some help .
is it just you guys?
would you excuse us , please?
okay .
are we still friends?
what do you mean?
are we?
of course .
how can you even ask me that?
well , it doesn't matter .
it doesn't matter?
it does matter .
i heard about you and margot .
i'm sorry .
i don't know what to say .
you don't have to say anything .
i always wanted to be a tenenbaum , you know .
me , too .
me , too .
'cause it doesn't mean what it used to though , does it?
i wish he'd done this for me when i was a kid .
but you didn't have a drug problem then .
yeah , but it would've meant a lot to me .
anyway , i'm glad you're here now .
i recognize that i have a problem ... and i want to get better .
i'll just grab my stuff .
there he goes .
what? !
there he goes .
tucker !
skiddly , skiddly .
/ christmastime is here / / happiness and cheer ... /
i'd like to order some ice cream for my daughter , please .
what would you like , margot?
nothing .
i told you i have to go in five minutes .
oh .
i'll have a butterscotch sundae , i guess .
your brother's all torn up inside .
well , so am i , but i'm not going to discuss it with you .
oh ...
can't somebody be a shit their whole life and try to repair the damage?
l i mean , i think people want to hear that .
do they?
mmm .
you probably don't even know my middle name .
that's a trick question .
you don't have one .
helen .
that was my mother's name .
i know it was .
anybody interested in grabbing a couple burgers and hitting the cemetery?
i got something for you , ethel .

from you?
yes .
this is sanchez .
he's a notary public .
hello .
hello , sir .

i got to catch my bus .
thanks , sanchez .
you're welcome .
are we divorced?
almost .
sanchez just has to file the papers .
i love you , etheline .
congratulations to both ofyou .
i didn't think so much of him at first .
but now i get it .

oh , yeah .
i forgot .
you know , i'm a widower myself .
i know you are , chas .
what are you chewing on?
my nicotine inhaler .
it's supposed to help me quit .
is it working?
not really .
well , of course , i'm half hebrew but the children are three quarters mick catholic .
so they were raised in the church?
i believe so .
i really don't know .
here i come .
boys !
what was that?
eli just crashed his car into the front of the house .
oh , my god .
where's my shoe?
ari , uzi , where are you?
they're okay , chas .
it's okay .
they're safe .
they're safe .
dad , they ran over buckley .

dad .
he pulled them out of the way .
you did?

yeah .
i need help .
so do l .
go around to the other side .
you kids stay there .
we'll be right back .
yeah .
can i say something to you , henry?
okay .
i've always been considered an asshole for about as long as i can remember .
that's just my style .
but i'd really feel blue if i didn't think you were going to forgive me .
i don't think you're an asshole , royal .
i just think you're kind of a son of a bitch .
well , i really appreciate that .
could you let us in your backyard , ma'am?
we've got a couple boys back there .
i think you may have broken an ankle .
well , that's not terribly serious , is it?
do you have an alternate?
no .
ready?
are there priests on call?
why don't you bring the car around , anwar .
at which point , i apparently lost control of the vehicle smashed it into the house , and killed that poor dog .

78 35 , code six .

spark plug , sit , sit .
good boy .

you look great .
can you see out of it?
not really .
uh huh .
minor corneal damage .
page me if it spreads to the other eye .
who do i make it out to?
alex?
okay .
but these aren't structure bearing elements , dad .
it doesn't matter .
it's still best to file another force majeure and recoup the deductible .
you boys come up here with me .
but buckley's still under there .
i know , but there's nothing we can do for him at the moment .
come on .
i got you a new dog for the boys .
i just bought him .
you did?
sorry i let you down , chas .
all ofyou .
i been trying to make it up to you .

spark plug .
thankyou .
you'rewelcome .
i've had a rough year , dad .
i know you have , chassie .
hey .
see , now he has more white feathers on his neck .
i wonder what happened to him?
i don't know .
sometimes if a person has a traumatic experience their hair turns white .
well , i'm sure he'll get over it .
this was one of my first hiding places .
how old do you think those are?
i'd say about ten years .
come here .
royal dug a hole for buckley behind the garden shed and buried him in a canvas duffel bag .
all right , boys .
say a prayer .
dear heavenly father ...
i do .

change sides .
royal had a heart attack at the age of 68 .
chas rode with him in the ambulance and was the only witness to his father's death .
in his will , he stipulated that his funeral take place at dusk .
among the few possessions he left to his heirs was a set of encyclopedia britannica in storage at the lindbergh palace hotel under the names ari and uzi tenenbaum .
no one spoke at the funeral and father petersen's leg had not yet mended ... but it was agreed among them that royal would have found the event to be most satisfactory .
