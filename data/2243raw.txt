aren't you forgetting something?
something to do with the third coefficient .
not that .
tonight .
what?
emma?
what time is it?
almost 5 .
oh , god .
my concepts for microenergy waves , rejected .
the dean suggests i focus on something to help mankind .
like his tobacco study .
alex , your ideas are too radical .
the problem is the faculty .
they're dinosaurs .
they're extinct and don't know it .
one day they'll be discovered by a future archeologist .
their dim little eyes
it's your first year as associate professor .
play things more ...
... conservatively .
you sound like my father .
look at them , philby .
all alike .
ldentical bowler hats .
you want your students to be like that?
i want my students prepared for the realities of the world .
i want them to run along , knocking off every bowler they see .
mrs. watchit !
oh , huzzah , the master's home .
you get it?
hello .
hello .
you're looking in the pink .
must be the scampering ...
... up and down the stairs .
you get it?
i got it .
don't think i'm letting you go out in that filthy jacket .
now , go in there and change .
and you got another letter from that annoying man .
go ahead .
switch it on .
it'll help people keep their teeth well into their 40s .
you might think about cleaning that .
who has the time?
how did you know with molly?
lknow what?
you were meant to be together .
she made the best shepherd's pie .
not one romantic bone in your body .
no , i'm all bowler hat .
why do you waste time on that crackpot?
he has interesting ideas .
a professor shouldn't correspond with a crazy german bookkeeper .
he's a patent clerk .
mr. einstein deserves all the support i can give .
i wonder if we'll ever go too far .
with what?
with this .
with all of this .
no such thing .
all right .
how do i look?
practically decent .
good luck .
she's a fine girl .
she's done wonderful things .
don't worry , you still have that alluring chalk smell .
oh , gotta hurry .
that's more like it .
you look a proper gentleman for once .
better hope so .
lf emma turns me down , you're next .
i'm already swooning .
all right , wish me luck .
thank you .
fresh flowers !
fresh flowers !
flowers , sir?
not tonight , thanks .
no .
i promised her flowers .
spectacular .
spectacular waste of money .
damn thing always breaks down .
need a lift?
yes .
how's the temperature stabilized?
a cantilevered gasket on the fuel regulator
much obliged .
i'm always forgetting the damn brake .
hop in .
i'll give you a perambulation before it breaks again .
i have a prior engagement .
another time .
we perambulate most every night .
certainly .
get a horse !
yes , yes .
alexander !
you're late , professor .
i got here as soon as i could .
they say it's the rage in paris .
but i picked it up for $5 at macy's .
silly , isn't it?
very silly .
i like it .
well , where are they?
what?
the flowers .
you promised me flowers tonight .
oh , i'm sorry .
i was distracted .
well , there is something new .
emma , i need to talk to you .
shall we walk through the park?
yes .
professor , you're shivering .
i hope you're not coming down with something .
well , i'm afraid i am .
i'm not sleeping very well .
even awake , i'm not much use .
i can't eat ... ... or think or do much of anything anymore .
the worst part is , i don't know that i'll ever be well .
there's only one remedy .
for you to marry me and spend the rest of your life with me .
emma , i know it's right .
we're meant to be together .
it's the only thing i've never had to think about .
oh , alex .
wait , i have something for you .
the moment is rather dying here .
i know .
hold on .
i know it's not a diamond .
a moonstone .
well , it's your birthstone .
i thought
you thought right .
i just might cry .
i couldn't help but overhear .
two fine young people ... ... starting out on the road of life .
i wish you the very best .
well , thank you .
and much as i hate to do this , moved as i am by your ... ... protestations of love ... ... l'll be needing your money now .
sir?
and your jewelry too .
we can call this your first bump on the road to marital bliss .
i don't  don't make a scene .
there's no cause for that .
give me your wallet , would you?
did you hear me , lad?
all right , all right .
here , that's everything .
your watch .
and the gloves .
and the ring .
no .
i'm afraid so , darling .
maybe he'll buy you a diamond now .
please .
not that .
why did you do that?
it's only a ring .
emma .
emma .
what?
oh , sir , mr. philby's here .
here?
yes .
he insisted on coming
tell him to go away .
i'm busy .
i won't go away , alex .
my god , what's happened to you?
i've been working .
you used to care about your work .
i care more about my life and yours .
i came by every day after the funeral .
every week , every other month .
then i stopped coming .
did you even notice?
it hurt me , alex , very much .
then why are you here now?
there are things i have to say .
i know .
you're concerned .
i hear it from mrs. watchit every day .
but really ...
... l need you to go .
i won't go with you hiding down here .
i'm not .
that's what it is .
you're in here all day .
alex , will you please stand still and look at me?
it wasn't your fault .
no .
it wasn't my fault .
maybe we should blame mrs. watchit for getting the ring from the jeweler .
or the jeweler for making it .
or the poor bastard who tore the stone from the earth .
i should blame you for introducing us in the first place .
alexander , nothing will ever change what happened .
no , you're wrong .
because i will change it .
david , i appreciate your concern .
i do .
but i ask you to have faith in me .
i want to have faith in you , alex , but ... ... what are you doing here?
why don't you come by for dinner in a week ... ... and i'll show you?
come home with me now .
did you not hear me?
i can't leave when i'm so close .
all right , we'll continue this conversation in a week .
ln a week , we'll never even have had this conversation .
ah , thank you , my good man .
yeah , i'll need a pair for me .
you're early .
that's a first .
i wanted to see you .
well , where are they?
what?
the flowers .
you promised me flowers tonight , don't you even remember?
you never cease to surprise me .
emma , i need to talk to you .
shall we walk through the park?
no .
no .
let's go into the city .
alex , what is it?
nothing .
just hurry !
running is all very well for you .
you're not wearing a corset !
bleecker street , and be quick about it !
good evening .
oh , now you're all gallant .
you're shivering .
i hope you're not coming down with something .
no , no .
i'm fine .
i'm wonderful .
just walking with you again .
we took a walk three days ago .
well , not like this .
never like this .
heavens , look at that .
i've seen it .
now i know you're ill .
you're passing up the chance to explore a new gadget .
it's only a machine .
tell me what's going on .
ls something wrong?
no .
emma , listen .
i need to leave , but i want you to go home and stay there .
i promise i'll come by later .
i'll be upset you didn't meet me in the park ... ... but you must trust me .
everything will be all right .
just know how much i love you .
how much i'll always love you .
all right .
but first , where are my flowers?
flowers , it is .
wait right there .
don't move .
oh , can i help you , sir?
yes , a dozen roses , white .
no , red .
i'm looking for professor hartdegen .
alex , i'm ....
i'm so sorry .
this was not supposed to happen .
of course not .
i know there's nothing i can say .
we were out of the park .
we were safe .
why can't i change it?
i could come back a thousand times .
see her die a thousand ways .
i don't understand .
i can't find the answer here .
not here .
not now .
the future is now .

emma .
hello .
don't be afraid .
wait , don't go .
wait .
i just want to talk to you .
hello .
i'm sorry , i don't understand you .
do you know my words?
yes .
let's talk alone .
the lex , the stone language .
the stone language?
but do you understand me?
we all learn it when we're young .
they tor'jen .
forget , they forget it .
but i teach .
what is he saying?
they're deciding if we should throw you in the river .
tell me the truth .
where do you come from?
well , actually , i'm from here , just not from now .
you see , i built a machine that allows me to travel through time .
i'm from the past .
oh .
i told them you hit your head and you are a wandering idiot .
what are you doing?
getting ready for the mor .
the night .
i'll come with you .
eloi?
what are your people named?
well , i guess you'd call us new yorkers .
new yorkers , are they friendly?
until you talk to them .
tell me about your village .
it's a busy place .
everyone seems to be in a hurry .
and they all wear identical bowler hats .
little round things on their heads .
what do you do?
i was a teacher , like mara .
and i make things .
i made a sess'quin'tan with my papa .
we still use it .
a sess'quin'tan?
sess'quin'tan , steps of rope .
a rope ladder .
we can make one .
i will teach you .
will you tell me more on the next day?
tomorrow?
yes , i will .
why don't you take care of this for me tonight?
thank you .
good night .
good night .
lkalen will tire you if you let him .
he's always questioning .
our parents were firm , but it is his way .
where are your parents?
they've gone from this place .
i'm sorry .
you were right , philby .
i did go too far .
sit with me .
mara , why do you pull the boats up at night?
are you afraid they'll be stolen?
stolen?
i do not know that word .
will someone take them?
it is just more safe this way .
you must do things to be safe where you're from?
well , of course .
yes .
or when you come from .
so i'm not just a wandering idiot .
col'mar .
maybe we could find some tomorrow .
flowers?
morlock !
morlock !
ls he all right?
he had a dream .
so did l .
i was moving through a jungle and  and you saw a shape ahead of you .
a face that called my name .
we all have that dream .
all of you?
yes , now go back to sleep .
you're still not well .
what does that mean , " morlock "?
a child's dream , no more .
go back asleep .
we keep these stones in many places .
this is the room where my parents taught me for the first time .
why do you learn this language if you don't use it?
it's a tradition we hand down .
it meant something once .
it must be here for a reason .
one generation passeth away , and another cometh .
but the earth abideth forever .
why have you come here?
why do you travel through time?
to have a question answered .
a question?
yes .
why can't i change the past?
why would you want to?
you've lost someone .
someone you loved very much .
mara , why are there no older people here?
what do you mean?
older people , your parents 'age .
they've gone from this place .
you mean they're dead?
yes .
all of them?
how is that possible?
there are things better left unsaid .
we don't dwell on the past , alexander .
we do something else .
what?
we remember them ... ... with these .
alexander !
alexander .
are you coming to work now?
come with me .
he's not well .
we're gonna see his machine .
now?
stay with toren .
go the next day , tomorrow .
i need to see that it's all right .
this way .
will you tell me more about new york tonight?
i will .
good , it seems fine .
we had quite a ride together .
it's ready?
it appears so .
will you use it now?
go back to your own time?
well , i guess i could .
it seems so long ago .
no , you should go .
and i need to ask ... ... will you take lkalen with you?
why?
take him away .
back to your time .
will you?
mara , why?
please , you don't know .
take him away from here .
lkalen !
mara , what's going on?
they're early .
we must get lkalen .
lkalen !
lkalen !
lkalen !
mara !
lkalen !
no , stay here .
stay in the group .
run !
where did they go?
we have to follow .
we do not col'quin tor , no .
why not?
this is nem eloi'tas .
our life here .
how can you just do nothing?
how can tor'tas al'mor?
it's day and night .
day and night?
this is the world .
why don't you fight back?
fight back .
why not?
those who far quil'pax ... ... fight ... ... are taken first .
do you know where they go?
no .
do they come back?
no .
has anyone followed?
i don't know .
what about the morlocks?
there must be a leader . lkalen , listen !
sometimes we need to accept what happens .
and other times we have to fight .
even if we are afraid .
now , it's difficult to understand .
i know .
believe me , i know .
now , they're afraid ... ... and i'm asking you not to be .
so will you tell me what you know?
we can save her .
please .
when they go , we're not supposed to talk about it .
but we all know of a place .
what place?
where the ghosts are .
here it is .
welcome to vox system .
how may i help you?
it's all right .
how may i serve you?
what can i get you?
let's see ....
henry james?
no , no , too depressing .
hemingway , perhaps?
no , no , too sweaty .
plato , proust , pinter , poe , pound?
no .
the complete works of martha stewart?
i have it !
jules verne .
right up your alley , i would think .
photonic , right?
or what's left of one .
what's left of all of them .
i am the last .
and these fragments i have shored against my ruins , " t. s. eliot .
you wouldn't know him yet , but he is so depressing , yet so divine .
i'm sorry .
the lending library is out of service .
not to worry , i have them all right here .
every page of every volume .
can you tell me what's happening?
my sources are no longer annotated ... ... and my information is anecdotal .
but what was once one race is now two .
one above and one below .
two distinct species that have evolved .
and how do those below survive?
that is the real question , isn't it?
i don't believe it .
lf you don't like the answers , you should avoid asking the questions .
look at them .
they have no knowledge of the past .
no ambition for the future .
so lucky .
why would you say something like that?
can you even imagine what it's like to remember everything?
i remember the girl who asked me about dinosaurs 800, 000 years ago .
i remember the last book i recommended .
look homeward , angel by thomas wolfe .
and , yes , i even remember you .
time travel .
practical application .
how do you know about the morlocks if you can't leave this place?
one eloi managed to escape .
he told me everything .
we spent years together .
just talking .
the conversation's a little spotty now , but i do remember .
it's good to have a friend .
then you can help us find the morlocks , find mara .
and if the truth is so horrible , it will haunt your dreams for all time?
well , i think i'm used to that .
my friend said he came from the east .
from the jungle .
can you describe it?
i don't have to .
just follow the breathing .
ln the dream we're moving toward it .
but i think it was meant to keep us away .
i might just go in by myself .
no .
mara would be very cross with me if you got hurt .
i'll find her .
go to the village and light a fire so we can find our way home .
will you do that for me?
i lost your pocket watch .
they took it from my room .
i'm sorry .
why would they take it?
stupid .
mara .
mara?
mara .
mara?
come a little closer .
i don't bite .
do i surprise you?
a little , yes .
we weren't always like this .
after the moon fell from the sky ... ... the earth could no longer sustain the species .
some managed to stay above .
the rest of us escaped underground .
centuries later , when we tried to re emerge into the sun , we couldn't .
so we bred ourselves into castes .
some to be our eyes and ears .
some to be our muscles and sinews .
you mean your hunters .
yes .
bred to be predators , but bred also to be controlled .
you see , my caste ... ... concentrated on expanding our cerebral abilities .
you control their thoughts .
not just theirs .
the eloi .
so it's not enough that you hunt them down like animals .
that's their role here .
to be your food .
yes .
and for those who are suitable , to be breeding vessels for other colonies .
you see , i'm just one of many .
i don't understand how you can speak so coldly about this .
have you not considered the human cost of what you're doing?
we all pay a price ... ... alexander .
don't worry , you're safe .
i control them .
without that control ... ... they would exhaust the food supply ... ... in a matter of months .
food supply?
they're human beings !
who are you to question 800, 000 years ...
... of evolution?
this is a perversion of every natural law .
what is time travel but your pathetic attempt to control the world?
your futile effort to have a question answered .
do you think i don't know you , alexander?
i can look inside your memories .
your nightmares .
your dreams .
what if?
daddy !
daddy !
you built your time machine because of emma's death .
lf she had lived , it wouldn't have existed .
so how could you use your machine to go back to save her?
you are the inescapable result of your tragedy .
just as i ... ... am the inescapable result ... ... of you .
you have your answer .
now go .
i believe you have something that belongs to me .
we all have our time machines , don't we?
those that take us back are memories .
those that carry us forward ...
... are dreams .
you're forgetting one thing .
what if?
what are you doing with it?
changing the future .
come on .
wait here .
go !
hurry !
alexander !
i'm sorry you lost your machine .
oh , it's all right .
it was only a machine .
the congregation rose and stared while the three dead boys ... ... came marching up the aisle .
tom in their lead , joe next and huck ... ... a ruin of drooping rags , sneaking sheepishly in the rear .
they had hid in a gallery , listening to their own funeral sermon ....
aunt polly , mary and the harpers ....
this is the place .
so it is .
but there's nothing here .
well , it was different then .
my laboratory was all around here .
the kitchen was over there where that tree is .
not that mrs. watchit ever let me go in there .
i don't know what to tell you , sir .
he's been gone this whole week .
and you have no idea where he went?
no , sir .
this would be my greenhouse .
there was a garden outside .
yes .
i'm glad .
sir?
i'm glad he's gone .
maybe he's finally found some place where he can be happy .
this was my home .
his home .
long ago .
you know , molly and i were talking about engaging a housekeeper .
someone to live with us and help take care of jamie .
are you interested?
perhaps until the master returns .
of course .
but there'd be some changes made .
i run a tight house .
i have no doubt of that .
i'll call and we'll arrange it .
good night , mrs. watchit .
good night , mr. philby .
godspeed , my fine lad .
godspeed .
