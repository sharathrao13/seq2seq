your father .
are you crazy?
ana's mother , a divorced french woman , a teacher ... ... at the foreigners institute ... ... didn't object about tenoch sleeping with her daughter .
it was different for julio .
he stayed with cecilia until dinner , and came back the next morning .
it wasn't noticeable , but cecilia's father , an allergy specialist ... ... feared that her relationship with julio went too far beyond .
her mother , a psychologist ... ... saw it positively , as an innocent thing .
she can't find her passport !
then she's gonna miss the plane !
julio !
help me looking for the passport !
be quick , we're in a hurry !
yes , yes .

hi , dad !

ana's father was a journalist , recently converted to politics .
he was the director of the institute of culture in mexico city .
he had a liking for tenoch ... ... but with his party mates ... ... and never in front of ana , he called him " the young lad " .
let's go .

did your father get pissed?
no .
he got angry .
if i don't take economics , i can forget the car .
being left without " murcigalo " ...
only for not willing to study?
i hate economists !
they can all go fuck themselves .
what an idiot .
no way .
i wanna be a writer .
come with me at literature .
no , i pass .
fucking traffic !
i bet boinas is there demonstrating .
it's her right , charrolastra .
and it's my right to tell'em they're sons of a bitch .

but there are always nice chicks at those demonstrations , huh?
that's for sure .
do you wear perfume?
holy shit !
you're the hog !
open it !
open it !
there's the safe lock .
open it , asshole !
that day , three demonstations took place .
but the jam had been caused by a pedestrian having been struck .
marcelino escutia , an immigrant carpenter from michoacn .
marcelino was hit by a truck at high speed .
he never used the pedestrian bridge ... ... because it forced him to walk 2 more km . to get to the building yard .
his unidentified body was recovered ... and brought to the mortuary .
it was claimed 4 days later .
tenoch was the second of three sons of a harvard economist ... ... subsecretary of state ... ... and of a housewife attending esoteric courses and activities .
they decided to name tenoch " hernn " ... ... but then his father took a job for the government ... and hit by nationalism ... ... he named his son " tenoch " , an aztec name .
i'll roll this joint and we're off .
i've brought some stuff from san francisco .
it's a charm !
uncut pills .
really?
go with the trip !
if i see miriam i'll bite her tits and fuck her hung by her ears !
what a chick !
hell , yeah !
she rubbed herself on me at rata's party .
really , what a slut !
i wanna make sazn's woman .
what an ass and what tits !
yeah , sazn's woman is outstanding .
oh , not here , assshole .
on the terrace !
the smell is the same .
it stinks , dude !
nicely damp , isn't it?
don't be an asshole .
dry .
of course .
monkey stuff .
a strong joint .
tenoch !
my mother .
hello , madam .
how are you?
hi , julio .
hi , mom .
honey !
what's up , kids?
you look weird .
are you a bit sad?
it's for the girls , right?
come on , boys !
love has upset you all !
think of them , and you'll be with them .
are you coming at jessica's wedding?
how could i miss .
you'll have to dress elegantly .
there will be the president , too .
tenoch , throw that cigarette .
hello , madam .
your garden rocks .
saba , i didn't know you were here , too .
i'm everywhere .
at the party , julio and tenoch used alcohol and marijuana ... ... and the ecstasy from san francisco .
their conquering plans failed .
they were afraid that their failure could mark their summer destiny .
at 4 am julio threw up on the road .
at 5 , tenoch broke a car's lamp going back home ...
the same night ... ... saba had his first group sex experience .
a week passed by
for julio and tenoch , boredom became routine .
tenoch's father was a shareholder of a sporting club ... ... so his son could get in on monday , the closing day .
one , two , three .
you were breathless 'cause you had just smoked .
the pro .
you only gave me two meters .
10 at least , asshole .
four , at best .
two and a half .
you always exaggerate .
hey , i don't want to exaggerate , but ... ... you got a really ugly cock
it looks like a hooded monk ...
then get on your knees .
confess yourself !
don't be a queer !
six , seven ... ... eight , nine , ten , eleven .
more bodyguards than guests .
count them .
3 for the comonforts , 3 for the guerreros .
don't point .
my father's boss got two , like that government guy .
plus all the major state .
add herminio , won't you?
no , he's my driver .
but he's armed .
looks like our tenoch is pretty drunk .
dad , i've greeted the president .
the gonzales bocanegras are looking for you .
please , behave with them .
they've always been so nice with you .
all right , dad .
do you remember the fatty girl?
how are you?
it's been a century !
you see?
what are you doing?
what a bunch of assholes , huh?
as you say , sir .
hey , buddy .
do me a mil lslas .
pretty loaded .
do you remember your cousin , tenoch?
he wants to be a writer , too .
you'll have a lot of things to tell .
cheers .
cheers , aunt .
thanks .
what a lady , huh?
yes .
how are you , baby?
the last time , you were a child ... ... crying for the ninja turtles .
it was a thundercat .
sorry , a thundercat .
so you want to tell stories about children?
no , stories about morons like you .
writing in high school is one thing , literature is another one .
when are you starting?
did you read my book?
i've read the critics .
critics are all assholes !
alejandro montes de oca , " jano " , was tenoch's cousin .
his father died when he was 3 .
he was committed to his aunt .
he managed to escape abroad with a master course .
he had just returned after 10 years .
think well .
do you really want to be a writer?
it's full of writers , but the good ones are few .
it takes a life to become one .
my cousin , the writer .
it's not just discipline and improving your technique .
no , you need a personal style , too .
you must have lived a lot .
let's be honest , what have you lived?
yes , tenoch , what experience do you have?
fuck , guys !
sorry , sorry .
are you all right?
i wish ... ... to thank you all ... ... for your presence at this humble celebration .
and especially ... ... the president of the republic and his charming lady ... ... who have shared with us ... ... this important moment for jessica and francisco ... ... in spite of their duties .
it's really ... a sensitive act .
in front of such illustrious guests ... ... i want to wish the newly weds the most absolute happiness .
damn , what a beauty .
hello .
pleased to meet you .
hi .
hello .
hi .
aren't you bored of this all?
no .
not even a little bit?
pardon .
well , a little bit .
yes?
but where are you from?
madrid , spain .
and what are you doing here?
my husband is one of the relatives .
of the groom?
no , of the bride .
did you see what they've done to me?
yes , you , fuck !
luisa corts was left an orphan when 10 because of a car accident .
she was grown by her grand aunt ... ... a franchist who fell sick and was taken care of by luisa in her last 5 years of life .
luisa always lived with her .
at 20 she married jano .
months later , the grand aunt died , and luisa lost her last relative .
what happened?
those assholes .

jano talked to me a lot about it .

the mariachis .
the president left one hour later .
he had a meeting ... ... with the executive committee for the electoral candidates choice .
the next morning , at 10 ...
he shown disappointment for the cerro verde massacre ... ... denying that the governor of the state knew anything about it .
after expressing his condolences ... ... he flew to seattle for a world summit on globalization .
the days passed by , and while jano was away because of his meeting ... ... luisa got some test results from her doctor .
are you a satisfied woman?
i prefer to be awake rather than sleeping and dreaming " .
i value time more than power or money " .
i think about today rather than yesterday or tomorrow " .
she scored 16 points .
the magazine found her afraid to claim her freedom .
luisa didn't agree .
think about conchita's tits .
those stiff and hard nipples .
excellent .
and mayela's pussy?
all wet and hairy .
your girlfriend's mother .

luisa .

really?
really .
fetch betsab .
it won't make it .
the radiator and the battery are screwed .
and it's my sister's turn to use it .
let's go with murcigalo .
my father took it off me because of the broken lamp .
what an asshole .
julio zapata lived with his mother and his sister .
he hadn't seen his father since when he was 5 .
his mother had always been a secretary in a corporation .
his sister manuela , known as " boinas " ... ... studied political sciences at the national university .
after a long negotiation , julio had the car for 5 days ... ... in exchange for 3 weeks ... ... during which boinas would go to chiapas to distribute provisions .
beer !
beer , beer , beer .
here's the beer .
one , two ..
for three !
condoms !
aren't there any of your size?
it's the men's sector .
beware , dude .
after puebla , get off the highway .
the landscape is a real riot .
yeah , that way .
then , once you're here , go this way .
damn .
saba , you fool , that's a river !
you're going towards veracruz !
no , towards oaxaca .
quiet , then you go this way ...
careful , right?
there are traffic control posts .
if you got weed stuff it in your balls , understood?
saba , we're in a hurry .
yes , be quick .
then you get to this small village ... ... there's a hut with a giant coca cola bottle on the top .
saba , and then what?
yeah , then?
what?
the beach , ugly fool !
yeah , the beach .
turn left on a country lane , and you're on the beach .
that's all .
yes?
i'll come down immediately .
give it to me , i'll help you .
be quiet , it's my car .
you haven't told us what you do for a living .
what do you think?
a sociologist .
cold .
philosopher?
no , cold .
psychologist .
really?
lingerie model .
frost !
we surrender .
i have a degree in odontology .
what's that? she dries your drooling , at the dentist .
really?
really?
why such a choice?
i didn't make it .
i never played with dolls ... ... or pretended to be a dentist .
why then?
i was 16 , my aunt fell sick ... ... and i had to find a job .
4 months later i had a degree .
but did you want to do something else before?
i didn't do well at school .
i wanted to travel .
travelling is super cool .
eh , yes .
you've never been on a plane !
what do you mean?
well , only three planes .
so what?
and so i would be a philosopher?
you look like someone who thinks .
of course , you're jano's wife .
luisa often attended to intellectuals 'dinners with jano .
she never integrated herself with them .
there was always someone willing to involve her ... ... or expose her ... ... giving her the word in the middle of a discussion .
i don't know anything about these things " .
sometimes , she would have wanted to ask them ... ... to list the names of all the teeth one by one .
she never did it .
charrolastra , pass me the chips .
what's charro ...
charrolastra?
yes .
what's it?
a mix of charol astrale and charro lastre .
cool , isn't it?
very .
charrolastra , charrolo
charrolastra , charrolo
according to saba ... ... it refers to the dead weight we are for your father .
so daniel and saba are charrolastras , too?
lately saba has been taken by the investigation of ... ... the altered states of his expanded conscience .
in a mystical phase?
no , dope .
he's out of mind .
we see daniel less and less .
every day he's more queer .
is that why you don't see him?
he wants to frequent different companies .
but we're still brothers .
pecas is just a honorary member ... ... because she has terrible boyfriends .
she didn't sign our manifesto .
manifesto?
tell me something .
no .
it's secret .
i won't tell anyone .
we'd be forced to kill you .
one : there's no greater honor than being a charrolastra .
two : to each his own .
three : pop killed the poetry .
four : a joint a day .
saba's idea .
five : don't fuck with the others 'girlfriends .
america's supporters are queers .
seven : death to the morals .
eight : forbidden to get married as a virgin .
club america's supporters ...
you've already said that .
it's repeated because they're queers twice .
crappy team .
ten : the truth is cool but unreachable .
the truth is the best , but it's very hard to reach .
eleven : whoever breaks one of the rules previously stated ... ... loses his title of charrolastra .
take your manifesto to the parliament and it will be a success .
but it's cool , isn't it?
don't the charrolastras eat?
julio and tenoch told her many other tales .
each story proved the strong ties ... that joined them , they were like one .
the stories , although enriched with personal mythology , were true .
but like it always happens , they were incomplete truths .
julio didn't say that he used to light matches to cover the smell in the toilet ... in tenoch's house ... ... nor tenoch revealed that he used to lift the toilet cover with his foot at julio's .
there was no need to know those details .
do you have girlfriends?
yes , ceci .
ana bananas .
bananas?
and where are them?
in europe .
they're thick as thieves .
where in europe?
around italy .
they're lucky .
they say it's wonderful .
yes , but that's not why .
why?
why did they go to italy?
for the clothes?
on holiday?
for the guys !
italian guys are hot !
what are you saying?
you don't know them .
right .
ceci wouldn't be able to betray me .
she wanted to tattoo my name on her tit .
but her mother didn't want her to .
i took ana's cherry .
she only does it with me .
exactly .
i'm pleased .
your girlfriends are lucky for having boyfriends like you .
and are you charrolastras faithful?
of course .
that's how it gotta be .
have you ever betrayed jano?
me?
betraying jano?
no , i'd never do that .
i'm so hungry ...
here comes the lady .
has he ever betrayed you?
jano always needed confirmations .
do you think so?
has he betrayed you?
some beer .
me too .
where did you meet him?
in a bar in madrid .
really?
i bet he was drunk .
no , he was sober .
i was the totally drunk one .
really?
yep .
and then?
and then?
" hey , what a chick you are ! " what did you see in him?
really , what did you see?
well , i don't know .
jano and me share a lot of things .
like?
well ...
he has no father and i'm an orphan
his mother was annoying ... ... like the aunt i used to live with .
those 5 years when i took care of her were terrible .
jano was the only one to be on my side .
shall we toast?
sure !
to relax .
so what will you have?
i don't know .
thanks .
good night .
good night .
hey , pal !
the small one for you .
easy , huh?
fuck , yes .
hey .
what's up?
will ana and ceci make some italians?
no , what are you saying?
ah , it's full of pee here .
no , huh?
absolutely not .
and then italians are queers .
sure .
d'ya think the little cousin's gonna screw us?
looks like jano cheats on her .
heavy stuff , huh?
we gotta comfort her .
make her smile a bit .
i'll show you .
come .
hi guys .
i'm coming .
what's up?
are you awake?
come on , the beach'll run away !
fuck , come on !
julio , the beach .
now?
the after breakfast , cool .

can you drive like that?
yes .
you don't feel bends .
we fly like the concorde .
monkey shit .
pure shit .
good stuff .
sure .
good .
d'you smoke a lot?
so and so .
you?
no .
want a beer?
tenoch didn't know tepelmeme ... ... birthplace of leodegaria victoria , leo , his nanny .
at 13 she had moved to mexico city .
leo found a job at lturbide's house , and took care of tenoch since his birth .
until he was 4 years old , he called her " mom " .
tenoch didn't comment .
there's something for everyone .
i saw you tonight .
what?
what?
you know what i'm talking about .
no , about what?
d'you think you're supposed to spy on a woman in a hotel?
it was his idea .
ah , yes?
and you followed him .
did you want to see me naked?
no .
and get a good hand job .
come on .
did you make love with many other women?
some .
stop it , you boaster .
what .
he's only fucked with his girlfriend .
see that you're wrong .
with whom then?
with flavia .
fuck off !
never .
the idiot came while he was still putting the condom on .
you told me .
what?
a little offer for the queen?
and you , tenoch?
what?
have you made love with others ... ... apart from your girlfriend?
some .
yes , 2 or three hookers .
hookers?
whores .
really?
do you go with whores?
the little queen is gorgeous .
i don't go with whores .
you do .
you're a whore chaser .
no .
goodbye !
goodbye !
wonderful !
turn it up !
did you fuck many guys before jano?
i started late and met jano soon .
were you a virgin?
a virgin?
no .
there was a guy before .
did he bang you hard?
tell us the truth , and go , go , go !
to be honest , yes .
he took me to the factory where his uncle worked .
i was dying with fear , i barely knew him .
i thought he wanted to kiss me .
no , instead ... ... he took my cherry .
the bastard .
he hurt me a real lot .
i said " i won't do it again " .
but we always ended up doing it in a row .
i thought he only wanted to screw .
but he also wanted to talk .
he fell in love with me .
sure ...
he used to pick me up on his bike ... ... in a leather jacket .
he was fascinating .
i was charmed .
i always played hooky any time i could .
playing hooker , like doing blow jobs and stuff?
yes , that , too .
no, playing hooky means cutting school classes .
i used to cut classes to spend more time with him ... ... in the park , or to take a good ride on his bike .
we were even about to go to the cote d'azur .
me too .
a friend of his had found me a job as a waitress .
we had everything packed and ready .
he had a pigtail and a broken tooth .
and an earring on the right .
i was in love with him , i swear .
deeply in love .
then jano came , right?
no .
so what?
dead in a bike accident .
heck .
he was 17 .
had they passed by there 10 years earlier ... ... they would have ran across a couple of cages in the middle of the road .
then across a cloud of white feathers .
shortly after , more crushed cages , with dying chickens .
later on , an overturned truck , surrounded with smoke .
they'd have seen two inert bodies on the ground ... ... the smaller one covered with a jacket ... ... and a hopeless woman crying on his side .
another cigarette .
nice song , dude .
the battery is down .
turn on the radio .
shit .
hide all the stuff .
don't worry .
calm .
don't stare at them .
damn , those are fucked .
don't look , pal .
what the hell's going on , dude?
hey , not a bad crotch .
that woke up both of you .
must have been the heat?
got a hard on , sucked?
you don't know how much .
he's got a super small one .
small , dork?
teodoro is 5 millimeters shorter than your rasputin .
bullshit .
did you measure them?
yes .
but his one is horrible?
how horrible?
hooded .
come on .
ah !
so beautiful !
what?
seen?
it sucks , it's disgusting .
how do you make love with them?
sweetly , with feeling .
yeah , with jiribilla .
with what?
with affection .
what do you exactly do to them?
first , some groping warms the oven .
some kisses on her titties and some nibbles on her nipples .
and then?
then i stick it all in .
with jiribilla .
and then?
i push 'till she's dying .
nothing else?
what do you mean?
ceci waves , shakes , moans , like an oyster with lemon .
ana cries .
oh , poor darling .
no , she cries with pleasure .
i figure it .
do you do it missionary style?
missionary , doggy style , everything .
ana likes to be on top .
and sitting , too .
and a good 69 , as well .
all the kamasutra .
all of it?
i do everything .
and what about that thing when you put a finger in ...
... in the ass?
in the ass?
oh , fuck !
go get some water !
some water !
i told ya .
towards san rafael .
and how much does it take?
it'll be ready tomorrow .
no , but thanks anyway .
nice sombrero .
yes , really nice .

really?
yes .
is it a gift?
yes .
thanks .
it looks good on me .

beautiful name , luisita .
hi , jano .
i know you're not back yet .
i'm calling cause i didn't leave any messages , not to make you worry .
i wanted to disappear from your life ... ... but i've understood it's not right .
this is my message , but actually , i don't know what to say .
i've met lady martina .
she's 98 and she remembers everything since when she was 5 .
imagine all she has lived ... and what we don't live .
the mousse your mother sent us is in the fridge .
pay the phone bill .
it's on the desk .
pick up your shirts from the laundry .

well , take care .

but take my panties off .
sure , sure .
no , come here .
oh , honey .
honey .
i'm sorry .
it's fine , it doesn't matter .
relax .
julio didn't know what he felt .
he only knew it wasn't anger .
he was 8 years old the last time he had felt that way .
one night he had gone out drinking ... and had found his mother in his godfather's arms .
julio had retired in silence ... ... and never told anyone about it .
how ware you , pal?
i'm here .
what about a little challenge?
no , it's all full of leaves .
no problem .
okay .
you've let me beat you .
you had no reason .
i made ana .
what?
you've heard me .
i made your girlfriend .
the last time tenoch had felt like that he was 11 .
he head noticed his father's picture on a newspaper accusing him ... ... of a fraud in the import of spoiled corn for the poor .
tenoch and his parents moved to vancouver for eight moths .
tenoch never asked the reason .
luisa didn't know about julio's confession .
during dinner , though , she felt the tension between the two friends .
she sensed the broken equilibrium ... ... that she had to reestablish .
good night .
good night .
good night , tenoch .
what's up?
don't you sleep with luisa?
fuck off .
how many times did you make her?
only one , and i was drunk .
when?
stop it .
no , tell me .
when?
i don't know .
how's it you don't know?
while you were at lake tahoe .
and where was cecilia?
she was sick .
was it at her place?
no .
where then?
at a party .
what party , asshole?
i don't know , dude .
it was fruity loopy's party , i guess .
the party when saba took her cherry?
i guess so?
what are you laughing , asshole?
saba .
don't laugh !
who started it?
both .
we were so fucking drunk .
and where did you do it?
in the sister's room .
how was ana dressed?
shit !
i can't remember .
was she wearing pants or a skirt?
what panties was she wearing?
what panties?
you've heard me !
white , i guess .
did she take it in her mouth?
no !
look at me , idiot .
did she suck it?
did you lick her?
no , of course not .
did she come?
how do i know?
it was very quick .
did she enjoy it?
how could i know?
and you , asshole , did you enjoy it?
no , no .
i felt like shit , i swear .
i wanted to tell you ...
fuck off , asshole !
to hell !
you've broken our friendship .
the trust !
you made my girlfriend .
you've screwed me !
and me , idiot , bringing you those fucking comics from lake tahoe .
and a shit of a dress for that whore of ana , fuck !
fuck off , dude .
fuck off .
tenoch , forgive me , pal .
i didn't do it on purpose .
not on purpose?
you can maybe stomp her foot not on purpose , not screw her !
right?
not make her !
not make her !
no .
he went on all night long .
tenoch engaged himself in an endless quest for details .
he wanted to make a puzzle with pieces that wouldn't always match .
in the meanwhile , julio melted some details to build a less painful truth .
lady martina gave luisa the stuffed mouse with her name on it as a present .
it belonged to her grand nephew luisa obregn ... ... died of a sunstroke crossing the desert of arizona ... ... looking for a better future .
luisa believed that the dead kept being present .
she wondered how long she would live on in other people's memories .
but she didn't want to fill her mind with thoughts of death .
she heat has hit you , too?
a crazy heat .
hey , where are you going?
stay here .
i wanna see rasputin .
listen , i don't like the idea .
had julio come into my room , it would have been the same .
bullshit .
if you think i'm the driver , fuck yourselves .
go fuck off !
calm down !
fucking hogs !
me , me , me , me .
the shoes .
the what?
shoes .
okay , pull'em off .
now ...
... this way , this way , this way .
come here !
give it to me .
come , feel me .
be calm .
quiet .
look at me .
look at me .
wait for me .
careful .
i'm sorry .
nevermind .
be quiet .
luisa , i'm sorry .
it's just that ...
don't act this way , come on !
wasn't this what you wanted?
it was your game , right?
taking me on a trip to fuck me , wasn't it?
so what?
god , what idiots .
i shouldn't have done it with none of you .
that's what i should have done .
i didn't want to hurt anyone .
do you believe me?
do you forgive me?
yes , yes .
let's go .
me too .
you too , what?
julio .
me too , asshole .
you too what?
i made your girlfriend , ceci .
it's not true .
when?
after the plastilina mosh gig .
son of a bitch .
that's why you brought me home first , right , asshole?
where?
my place .
your place?
in my room , dude .
she had flowered panties .
did you screw her?
the asshole made mine .
what happened to three?
don't fuck the others 'girlfriends .
that's five !
get out !
get out , asshole !
now i'll tear you to pieces !
open !
hey , guys , stop it !
fuck ...
a classic for a boor .
now the boor's gonna smash your face !
blow me , dork !
fuck off !
snob queer !
to hell .
julio listen ...
son of a bitch !
i thought you were different , but you're animals !
the futile manifesto !
not following your own rules !
you mark your territory and quarrel but you just want to screw each other !
that's what you like !
who cares if you screw each other's women , if you come immediately?
who made me do this?
i'm here changing diapers .
seen , asshole?
come on , get out , open !
no .
she's leaving .
you've pushed her .
how could you make my ceci?
that whore !
so we're even , right?
even?
not fucking even !
get on your knees , like you made me do .
come on !
i'm sorry .
on your knees , son of a bitch !
she's looking for a lift .
i know , asshole !
on your knees !
move away .
move away if you want me to get out .
here you go .
come on , i won't do anything .
out .
sorry .
on both your knees .
i beg your pardon , julio , for screwing your girlfriend , okay?
come on , idot , she's leaving .
how many times did you make her?
just once , what do you think?
you're not a charrolastra anymore !
you don't mean anything to me anymore .
you neither .
you're a piece of shit !
come on , luisa , get in .
no .
i'll take a bus to puerto escondido !
to hell with you and heaven's mouth .
we want to go there with you .
why?
to quarrel .
no , thanks .
we won't quarrel .
we promise .
i can picture myself , with two dorks .
we've been assholes .
we'll do as you say .
you command .
it's a few steps from here ! it's close , come on .
but we do as i say .
at the first quarrel , i'll go away .
as you say .
now i'll set my rules .
i'll make my manifesto .
you've gone beyond , julio .
i won't fuck with any of you .
fuck each other , if you wish .
i sunbathe naked and i don't want you around and horny .
i choose the music .
you're required to kindly shut up when i say so .
you cook .
not another word on your poor girlfriends .
keep a distance of 6 meters .
if i prefer so , 100 .
you'll take care of all the labor .
you'll speak only if you already agree .
but if you just shut up , it's better .
it's forbidden to contradict me .
and especially pushing me .
julio and tenoch didn't know where they were ... ... or how to get to their destination .
saba's indications were contradictory .
afraid that luisa might found out , julio took a country lane .
they thought luisa was sleeping .
they didn't know that her fear prevented her from doing so .
it had nothing to do with darkness or with what was surrounding her .
hey !
we got ceviche ... ... fried fish and beer !
jesus carranza , known as " chuy " , and his wife mabel ... ... the fourth generation of a fishermen family .
they lived there , close to san bernabe .
chuy offered himself to escort them to the beaches the next day .
he asked them 350 pesos , including lunch .
let me drive it !
no .
i know how to .
fine then .
don't push it too much .
i know , i know .
nice place to have a bath , that one .
name?
the heaven's mouth .
very beautiful .
fine .
lucero !
don't harass the lady !
don't worry , mabel !
he's teaching me how to swim .
i'll help you .
no , i can make it on my own , thanks .
go to your friend , he's all lonely .
the water is warm .
go .
let's see how you play dead .
oh , she's dead .
oh , lucero .
christian is a whiner .
he spends all night crying .
he only stops in my arms .
he likes to be with his little sister .
so pretty , isn't she?
she looks a lot like you , mabel .
same eyes .
you should have sons , lady .
it shows you know how to handle them .
you're the in the right age , right?
he fell asleep .
what do i do?
marquez passes to ramon .
ramon places on zepeda .
he stands out like a colossus of santa ursula .
claudio the emperor steals the ball .
you can trust him !
a trustworthy emperor !
his majesty goes on , looks for a personal score .
just shoot , heck !
here we are .
a pass to cuauhtemoc which stops it .
he advances towards the goal ... ... and shoots !
the " human wall " !
campos !
that's why he's a regular of the national team !
that's why !
what?
don't you like campos?
wouldn't you want to live forever?
yes .
it'd be beautiful .
no?
by the end of the year , the family will move away ... ... because a new luxury hotel will rise in san bernabe .
they'll move to the suburbs of santa maria colotepec .
chuy will create a transports company ... ... but will be hindered by the acapulco syndicates ... ... and by the consortium of tourism .
two years later , he'll be a cleaner in a hotel .
he won't fish anymore .
heck?
what?
what the hell?
speed up chuy !
shit .
get away from here , you bastards !
not that way , no !
they're shitting inside here , dude !
get out , bastards !
you're throwing shit on me !
out !
let's go !
quick , litile shit !
the pigs tore the camp to pieces .
it was evening already , and julio and tenoch decided to sleep in the city .
for 75 pesos , chuy had found them a room with light and a toilet .
luisa was tempted by the idea of a shower , although a cold one .
they would go tomorrow to pick up their stuff .
the 23 pigs had run away from a farm near there .
during the following 2 months , 14 were sacrificed .
3 will cause a gall bladder infection ... ... after having being eaten at the " el chavarin " ranch .
don't spin , asshole !
tell your mother what you want .
let me talk .
let me talk or i'll hang up .
i would have left anyway , jano ... ... your call makes everything easier .
i 'grateful for that .
this is not a revenge .
i've always known about your betrayals carmen in escorial ... ... and the one in barcelona .
i've always known .
i just hoped you would change , that's all .
my decision has nothing to do with that .
i can't explain now , but soon you'll understand , okay?
don't blame yourself and don't blame me ... ... it's nobody's fault .
no , i don't hate you .
and please , don't hate me .
listen , jano , listen .
i'm calling to say that i love you , and that you've been my life .
i don't expect a happy farewell , but let it be affectionate , at least .
calm down , please don't act this way , please .
did you notice i took less money than what was due?
no , i don't need more .
i'm fine .
i let my keys in the kitchen .
don't lose the terrace key , there's just one copy .
i took the t shirts from ibiza .
you know i like to sleep in them .
i just hope you learn to be happy .
i am now .
take care , jano .
i'll hang up now , okay?
bye .
fuck you !
rematch !
i'm grateful to all the women jano has betrayed me with .
how did i notice?
fucking with him .
he experimented with me the things he learned from the others .
you finally understand .
like the finger in the ass , right?
yes .
come on , really?
but you must know how to do it .
with delicacy .
you can't just stick it in .
jano was a master of finesse .
to the master of finesse !
to jano !
jano , wherever you are .
i'm glad i've met you .
sometimes you're fuckheads , but in the end ... ... you're really smart .
you have the luck of living in a country like mexico .
you can breath life everywhere here .
to the sweet mexico !
to mexico !
magic and musical .
so , are you friends or not?
no .
come on , make peace .
and so i'm a boor?
right that .
do you remember that big thing?
fuck , that's my car .
and me , mr. delicacy?
okay , okay .
a hip guy .
but you like coming to my place?
to see what your father steals .
but his father is a honest man , right?
isn't he honest?
what assholes !
now you're friends again .
to the charrolastras !
to the charolastras !
want beer?
yeah , pretty cold .
sure , sure .
luisa .
what?
i'm sorry for the push .
oh , julio ...
... you went beyond .
i know .
give me a kiss .
forgive me .
you're forgiven .
who fucks better , between us?
the truth .
you make me laugh .
come on .
each one has certain qualities .
but who made you feel better?
honey .
honey !
i don't believe it , pal .
julio crosses his eyes .
but you must stop jacking off and improve your resistance .
he came sooner than me !
both do some training .
and number seven?
eliminate it .
chuy , isn't jacking off cool?
to jacking off !
yeah !
you can't toast to jacking off !
you don't know how to lick it .
i didn't do it at all .
you're surely as lame as tenoch .
you licked it like that , like it were an icicle .
it must be done with care .
the clitoris must be a great friend of yours .
it's a problem to find a great friend .
search and you shall find .
there's no greater pleasure than giving it .
an applause for the clitoris !
yes !
up the clitoris .
up the clitoris .
listen , seriously ...
ceci sucked you off .
the truth?
she nibbled it a bit , dude .
shit , she sucked you off !
ana bites , too?
no , she sucks greatly !
you said she didn't suck you off .
only the tip .
she missed the big dish .
aren't blow jobs great , chuy?
heck , chuy !
up the blow jobs !
wait .
i made ceci many times .
no problem .
i screwed ana many times , too .
i've been there mixing up the cream .
me too !
do you realize we're foster brothers?
he made my girl , but he comes in a blink !
to your girlfriends , who are making 10 italians at a time !
to luigi !
to francesco !
i toast to tiberio !
got any change?
who wants the little maggot here?
i'll take it .
hey , tenoch .
and your mother , too , you know?
what?
really .
the day she washed my clothes .
are you serious?
absolutely !
cheers !
you're crazy .
luisa !
to all mothers !
who sings the " fandunga "?
" la fandunga "?
are you joking?
actually no .
give me a number and a letter .
thirteen .
ah ...
b. 13 b.
after heaven's mouth there's palikata and the beaches of chacrita ... ... and santa rita .
and chacagua .
" chacagua . " what wonderful names .
what do they mean?
i don't know .
good morning , sleepyhead .
sleepyhead .
want some eggs?
a shrimp soup?
please .
and a beer .
the best antidote .
i gotta give the car back to my sister .
fine .
was it chacue ...
chacagua .
is there anything after chacagua?
there's amaranto .
golden beach is there .
huge , with many waves .
many people drown there .
but it's wonderful .
some more soup .
no , thanks .
i must go .
my parents must be worried .
and julio must give the car back to his sister .
i was talking with mabel about staying here some more ... ... to see some bays .
i'm hungry , mom .
well , here you go .
go , go !
that day julio and tenoch started their trip back home .
it was a silent trip with no events .
their parents never knew they had gone to the sea with luisa .
luisa stayed exploring the bays around .
life is like the foam of the sea .
you must dive into it " .
on their return , ana and cecilia broke up with tenoch and julio .
two months later , tenoch began going out with a neighbor .
it took 11 months for julio to go out with a french course mate .
julio and tenoch hung together less and less .
the next summer , the prl ... ... lost the elections for the first time in 71 years .
julio met tenoch who was going to the dentist .
a coffee was less uncomfortable than the excuses not to do it .
and saba , have you ever met him again?
i know he lives in real de catorce .
really?
fine .
and daniel?
self declared queer .
his father kicked him out of home .
a big trouble , isn't it?
on the contrary , he's happy .
he's even got a boyfriend and stuff .
it's fine then .
i've been admitted to the university .
great !
when will you start?
in september .
economics?
yep .
and you?
biology at the uam .
next week .
what a bad luck , huh?
yes .
the uam begins sooner .
do you know about luisa?
no .
what?
she's dead .
what the fuck are you saying?
anything else , guys?
no , thanks .
and how?
cancer .
she had it everywhere .
it happened there in san bernabe .
a month after our departure .
chuy called jano , and that was all .
terrible .
when we met her , she already knew she had to die .
she didn't want to tell anyone .
luisa spent her last 4 days in the hospital of santa maria colotepec .
by her request ... ...
chuy and mabel never revealed her adventure with tenoch and julio .
before dying , gave lucero the stuffed mouse with her name as a present .
tenoch apologized .
his girlfriend was waiting for him at the cinema .
julio insisted to pay the bill .
they never met again .
hear you , huh?
yep .
the bill , please .
