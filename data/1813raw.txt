your father and i have an engagement tonight , so i want you to have a nice early dinner .

yes , ma'am .
sybil , did mr. whitaker call while i was out?
not since you've been gone .
how do you like that guy?
mother , can i please get them?
janice , i said we'd discuss it with your father .
now hurry on inside .
david , put your bike away and help with the groceries .

i could only stay a second .
i still have loads to do .
david , what did i tell you?

mother?
mm hmm .
when you were a little girl , you lookedjust like me , right?
mm hmm .
so , when i grow up , does that mean i'll look like you?
is that what you want , darling , to look like me?
yes , i hope i look exactly as pretty as you .
what a lovely compliment coming from my perfectly lovely daughter .
7 : 15 .
where on earth is your father?
sybil , did i leave my gloves on the hall table?
yes , i see them .
it's nearly 20 after and mr. whitaker still hasn't phoned?
i'm at my wits 'end .
oh , thank you , sybil .
i tried phoning the office even though i knew no one would be there .
i certainly hope that's him , because if it isn't ...
whitaker residence .
this is the hartford police department ... calling for a mrs. frank whitaker .
who is it?
the police department .
hello?
yes , am i speaking with a mrs. frank whitaker?
yes .
one moment , please .
cathy?
oh , frank .
are you all right?
what happened?
everything's fine .
it was all just a big mix up ... the whole thing .
but you have to come get me .
they won't let me leave on my own .
oh , frank , don't worry , darling .
i'll be there as soon as i can .
is there anything i can do , mrs. whitaker?
just keep an eye on the children , please .
i don't think i'll be very long .
big time faggot .
family man .
never can tell .
say , get a load of this one .
you don't see that every day of the week .
this is your copy , ma'am , and your receipt .
thank you .
oh , frank .
i tell you one thing ... if it hadn't been for that sniveling junior cop , they would have never gone through this whole charade in the first place .
instead of trying to save face ...
i saw that guy that they were after , that loiterer .
but they wouldn't listen to me .
so , there were drinks after work?
what do you mean?
they said something , intoxication level , something ...
christ , i had one lousy cocktail with bill after work going over the portfolio .
should i be arrested for that too?
no , of course not , darling .
the whole thing has just put me in a foul state .
he's fine .
oh , the car's fine .
frank says it was the bumper that got hit .
but you know me , i can't tell the difference .
oh , i'm just sorry we had to miss it .
she was fine .
said it was all a dreadful bore , what with mona lauder ... and her gossip .
cathy ,
i'm sorry .
darling , you've nothing to be sorry for .
it was all just a silly , wretched mistake .
ohh .
i'm so tired .
of course you are .
you sleep now .
the bus is here .
have a good day at school .
bye .
i thought you were going to have another piece of toast .
it's late .
i should be getting down there .
can i at least fix you lunch?
no , thank you , dear .
i've got lunch meetings all week .
it's portfolio season .
sybil , if that's the milkman , his check is in the drawer .
i'm just glad you're feeling better , dear .
thank you , darling .
pardon me , ma'am , sir .
mrs. whitaker , this is mrs. leacock .
she said she had an appointment with you this morning .
oh , jiminy , i completely forgot the time .
please forgive me .
i do apologize , mrs. whitaker , but candid views are always the best .
good bye , darling .
good bye , dear .
mrs. leacock .
pleasure , mr. whitaker .
your husband's a very charming man , mrs. whitaker .
thank you .
we're rather fond of him ourselves .
now , please , won't you come in?
make yourselves at home .
i suppose i still can't imagine ... why you would want an interview with someone like me in the first place .
readers of the " weekly gazette , mrs. whitaker ... women just like yourself ... with families and homes to keep up .
a good society paper ... need not be a gossip rag .
you are the proud wife ... of a successful sales executive ... planning the parties , and posing at her husband's side on the advertisements .
to everyone here in connecticut , you are mr. and mrs. magnatech .
thank you .
i'm very flattered .
but , really , my life is like any other wife or mother's .
in fact , i don't think i've , i've ever wanted anything ...
what is it , dear?
i think i just saw someone walking through our yard .
what on earth ...
oh , my ...
mrs. whitaker , perhaps you should call the police .
excuse me .
may i help you?
who are you?
i'm sorry , ma'am .
my name is raymond deagan ...
otis deagan's son .
i was just taking over some of his ...
oh , you're otis's son .
yes .
i i'm terribly sorry for speaking to you in that manner .
i i didn't know who was in my yard .
oh , no need .
how is your father?
i know he was in the hospital .
yes , well , my father's passed away , i'm afraid .
oh ...
oh , i i had no idea .
i'm , i'm so very sorry .
please , accept our deepest condolences .
your father was a wonderful , dedicated man .
thank you .
mrs. whitaker?
the caterer's on the line .
oh , thank you , sybil .
i beg your pardon .
would you excuse me for just a moment?
of course .
mrs. leacock , i'm terribly sorry .
i'll just be one minute more .
that's fine , dear .
good morning , magnatech international?

millstein called .

you've got to be kidding me .
i wish i were .
what are they trying to do , strangle us to death?
does doug know?
yeah , i called him first thing .
all right .

oh , frank .
i'm sorry .
no , no , i understand .
i just wish you wouldn't overwork yourself , especially after ...
i know .
i will .
see you then .
good bye , dear .
i'm terribly sorry about all the interruptions .
now , where was it you wanted me?
just one more at the fireplace .
that's it .
now smile .
isn't that darling?
hold it .
well , i guess that about wraps it up .
bob , rick .
gentlemen .
you're sure you're all right getting home , sir?
thank you , davis .
but as 2nd in command of the " u. s. s. mcmillan ,
i do feel equipped to locate my own car without cover .
very good , sir .
bright and early .
sir , can you spare some change , please?
spare change?
anything would help .
spare change?
where ya headed , tiger?
look out , jake !
oh , for heaven's sake .
david , that is the third time i've told you to turn off that infernal racket and go to bed .
can i pleasejust this once?
no , you certainly may not , and that is final .
ah , geez .
that is not the kind of language we use in this house .
now march .
and don't forget to wash your teeth .
hi .
feeling better now?
mrs. white?
the picture?
yes .
i thought you really enjoyed the scene in the gentlemen's lounge .
how about a drink?
sure .
i knowjust the spot .
i'll bet you do .
identifiication , please .
huh?
identification ...
driver's license .
thank you , sir .
have a pleasant evening .
yes , sir .
what can i get you this evening?
uh , just a scotch ... neat , please .
yes , sir .
there you are , sir .
one more of the same .
so , does the fabled maxim hold that behind every great man there resides a great lady?
in this case , wife , mother and mrs. magnatech herself ,
cathleen whitaker proves that it does .
a woman as devoted to her family ... as she is kind to negroes .
to negroes?
let me see that .
what on earth is that woman thinking?
cathy?
oh , she's been liberal ever since she played summer stock at college ... with all those steamyjewish boys .
why do you think they used to call her " red "?
oh , for heaven sakes .
let's go inside before joe mccarthy comes driving by .
uh oh .
oh , i love that scarf .
oh , i'm sure itjust blew behind the house somewhere .
for heaven sakes .
this really isn't your day , is it?
no .
did they really call you " red "?
oh , nancy .
honestly !
would anyone like another daiquiri?
better not .
oh , no , one's my limit .
el?
mmm .
all right , girls .
no more beating around the bush .
nancy .
oh , i ...
i can't .
oh , come on .
it can't be that bad .
um , well , uh ...
mike insists on ...
he insists on once a week .
ah , you got off easy .
once a week?
oh , you're lucky .
ron's more like two or three .
three , really?
and how .
that's nothing .
girlfriend of mine ...
shirley dawson .
her husband ... every night of the week .
plus , three more times on the weekend .
can you imagine?
it was lovely , cathleen .
thank you .
bye .
bye , girls .
the chicken was divine .
oh , thanks , el .
i'll call you tomorrow .
all right .
bye bye .
could this possibly ...
oh , i'm sorry .
no .
you found it .
yeah , i found it hanging off one of the birches out back .
it was so windy .
i was going back into the house and it just sailed off my neck .
i had a feeling it might be yours .
who else could have been so absentminded?
no , no , it's the color .
it just seemed right .
well , thank you , mr. deagan ... for finding it .
please , call me raymond .
thank you , raymond .
everything looks wonderful , by the way .
good .
i think we got everything pretty much under control .
well , it can't have been easy ... taking over for your father so quickly .
well , between pop's business , my , uh , shop ... and taking care of my little girl , doesn't leave much time for reflecting .
i didn't know you had children .
just the one ...
sarah's her name .
and how old is sarah?
eleven .
well , i'm sure she's a lovely child .
you and your wife must be very proud .
well , um , mrs. deagan , my wife , uh , passed away when sarah was about five .
oh , raymond , i'm so sorry .
thank you .
sarah and i , we do just fine .
you know , i got a picture of her somewhere .
there she is .
that's my sarah .
oh , she's darling .
look at those eyes .
now , what's this i hear about a shop?
oh , yeah , the plant shop .
it's just a little place down on hawthorn .
started out as a service for gardeners ... till i opened the store about six years ago , and , uh ...
well , it's the only thing that business degree's been good for yet .
why , that's marvelous , raymond .
you should be very proud .
well , i am .
uh , if you're ever in the neighborhood , be sure to stop by .
i certainly will .
all right , then .
thank you .
you're welcome .
if that's your father ...
don't worry sybil , i'll get it .
hello?
frank , you haven't left yet?
oh , no .
not again .
all right .
good bye , dear .
he isn't coming home again?
no , he's going to be late .
father never wants to come home .
janice , he most certainly does .
he's just very busy at work and under a great deal of strain .
yeah !
shut up .
janice , that's enough .
sybil , you know what?
wrap up mr. whitaker's plate .
i'm going to run down to the office ... and take it to him myself .
all the way downtown?
it's not so very far .
anyway , the children are fine .
knowing mr. whitaker , i'm just saving him another night of pretzels and coffee .
thank you .
i'm just dropping something off for my husband on the 12th floor .
mr. whitaker .
thank you .
all right .
frank?
oh , frank .
frank?
cathy .
mr. maynard ...
left an estimate for the roof .
i put it in the kitchen .
twelve hundred something .
cathy ...
i can't .
i don't ...
what?
eh , you see , uh ...
once , a long time ago , a long , long time ago ,
i had , um , um , problems ...
i just " f" igured that was ...
that was it .
i i never imagined ...
you had problems?
y yes .
you , uh , never spoke to anyone ... a a doctor?
no .
no one?
i don't understand .
neither do i.
what if ...
i mean , there must be people who ... [ panting ]
i i don't know .
because ...
otherwise , i don't know what i ... cathy .
all right .
thank you .
mr. and mrs. whitaker , this is dr. bowman .
mr. whitaker , how do you do?
hello .
mrs. whitaker , how lovely .
thank you .
i suppose we may as well get started .
actually , uh , mrs. whitaker , i think it might be best ... if your husband and i conversed in private .
in private .
yes , of course .
i think it would be best .
certainly , doctor .
i'll see you later .
i'll see you later , dear .
today , the general attitude regarding this sort of behavior ... is naturally more modern , more scientific than it ever has been before .
but for those who do seek treatment , who possess the will and desire ... to lead a normal life , there still remains only a scant ... five to thirty percent rate of success ... for complete heterosexual conversion .
for many , it's the treatment itself ... that often changes the patient's mind .
what does it , uh , comprise of?
the treatment .
the treatment's comprised of psychiatric sessions ... twice a week , sometimes more .
just talking?
yes .
though some patients have explored additional , more behavioral methods .
behavioral?
electroshock aversion therapy for instance .
or hormonal rebalancing procedures .
i know this can all seem rather daunting at first .
i suggest you take some time .
think over the various options we've discussed .
discuss it with your wife .
no , i already know .
i want to begin treatment .
i can't let this thing ... destroy my life , my family's life .
i , uh ...
i i know it's a sickness , because it makes me feel ... despicable .
i promise you , dr. bowman , i'm going to beat this thing .
i'm gonna break it .
so help me god .
why don't you confirm those times we discussed with rosalyn .
i'll see you here same time next tuesday .
thank you , doctor .
mr. whitaker , mrs. whitaker .
thank you , doctor .
frank?
what?
i'm just proud of you , that's all .
don't say that .
well , i am .
he seems a very decent man , dr. bowman .
don't you think?
frank?
i don't know , cathleen .
i suppose he's decent .
but you must have liked him enough to want to see him again .
who else am i going to see?
well , i'm sure there are numerous doctors in hartford or springfield if you ...
look , i just want to get the whole fucking thing over with !
can you understand that?
frank , please don't .
i i'm sorry .
all right , cathy , i'm so sorry .
good morning , mr. whitaker .
morning .
morning .
good morning , mr. whitaker .
hi , kitty .
i hope you have a pleasant day , sir .
thank you .
good morning , mr. whitaker .
marlene .
i found this in the cupboard , sir .
what's that?
your office lamp ... the one that was missing .
ah ...
should i have it repaired , sir?
yes .
yes , thank you , marlene .
mr. whitaker , mr. fine's been waiting .
frank?
uh?
i didn't see you sitting there .
everything all right?
oh , with me?
of course .
what's up?
just picked up the galleys from the printer .
how do they look?
great , just great .
just leave them there .
i'll take a look first chance i get .
sure .
you'll let me know what you think?
of course i will .
you're first on my list .
what's it gonna take to get you back on that course anyway?
we haven't seen you for weeks .
i know .
sunday .
no excuses .
all right .
i'll hold you to it .
thanks again , el .
you sure that's all i can give you?
oh , yes .
the caterer should have everything .
i just thought a few extras would be nice .
oh , don't forget .
the art show is saturday .
start working on frank tonight .
i swear he's the kind of man you have to pin messages to .
though i'm sorry to say , mona lauder " will " be attending .
turns out her uncle's in town , some hotshot art dealer from new york .
i think i met him at one of mona's soirees .
a bit flowery for my taste .
how do you mean?
oh , you know , a touch light on his feet .
oh , you mean ...
yes , darling , he's one of those .
of course , i could be mistaken .
just an impression i got .
you don't care for them particularly?
well , no , not particularly .
not that i actually know any .
call me old fashioned , i just like all the men i'm around to be all men .
say , why the third degree?
it's not the third degree .
i'm just interested , that's all , in your views .
i read an article in a magazine .
what?
nothing .
i'm just delighted to see you taking interest in yet another civic cause .
i can see it now .
cathleen whitaker and her kindness to homosexuals .
ugh .
that word .
see you saturday ... and bring frank .
i'll try .
then billy hutchinson stole a pass at the ten yard line .
ran it all the way for a touchdown .
you shoulda seen it , pop .
father , want to see my routine for the ballet recital?
hey , i was talking to pop .
children , give your father a moment to eat his dinner .
would you like another lamb chop , dear?
oh , i'm fine .
are you sure?
i have plenty in the oven .
no , thank you .
i'm , i'm fine .
we're playing lincoln on saturday , pop ... if you're not working .
that reminds me .
this saturday is the reception for the modern art show i told you about , the one that eleanor's group is sponsoring .
oh , god .
i know how you hate these things , but i simply have to go .
eleanor pleaded with me to ask you .
wait , what about me?
no one cares one bit what i'm doing saturday .
david , i'm sorry .
but this saturday your mother has an engagement that simply cannot be changed .
well , pop could come .
couldn't you , pop?
we'll see , david .
janice , could you please pass the butter?
thank you .
president eisenhower was determined to keep the troops there until ... ... satisfactory or unequivocal assurances that ... frank?
hmm?
did you see him?
yeah .
you didn't say a word .
so how did it go with bowman?
did you feel ...
it was fine .
and there's nothing else you care to share with your very own adoring wife?
cathleen , what i discuss with this doctor ... it's private , all right .
that's part of it .
oh , i understand , darling .
i do .
oh ... [ chuckling ]
frank , wait till you see the hors d'oeuvres .
the caterer's doing , just such a marvelous job .
i think you're going to be so pleased this year , darling .
i really do .
eleanor , darling , i'm so sorry i'm late .
cathleen , darling .
hello , mona .
uh , i want to introduce you to my uncle , morris farnsworth , that wickedly successful gotham art dealer ... who was kind enough to attend our provincial little gathering .
morris , darling , allow me to introduce you ... to my dear little friend , cathleen whitaker , whose face and civic fancies are hardly strangers ... to the society pages of hartford .
oh , mona .
really , you must ignore her , mr. farnsworth .
charmed .
i do hope you enjoy your stay .
morris was just telling us the most delightful tale ... all about a forged rembrandt .
cathy , don't let us keep you .
i know you want to see the show .
i am dying to see it .
oh , yes , dear , simply charming .
eleanor , you should be so proud .
thank you , mona .
it was lovely to meet you , mr. farnsworth .
likewise , my dear .
wife of hartford executive ... communing with picasso?
mrs. leacock , it's lovely to see you again .
and how is that charming husband of yours?
oh , he's very well .
thank you .
um , would you excuse me just a moment?
oh , certainly , dear .
thank you .
raymond , what a tremendous surprise finding you here .
mrs. whitaker , hello .
is this your daughter?
yep , this is my sarah .
hello , sarah .
hello .
bobby , get over here !
say , sarah , isn't that hutch and his little brother i see playing out front?
you remember them , don't you , baby?
oh , sure you do .
the day we went to the hutchinson house .
oh , yeah .
what do you say you go out and see if they'd like to play for a while?
ah , go on .
for daddy?
attagirl .
oh , raymond , she's lovely .
thank you .
well , how on earth did you find out about this show?
well , i do read the papers .
w ...
no , of course you do .
i just meant that it's ... it's such a ... it's a coincidence .
i know .
i was just teasing you .
because , you know , i'm not prejudiced .
my husband and i have always believed in equal rights for the negro ... and support the n. a. a. c. p.
i'm glad to hear that .
i just wanted you to know .
well , thank you .
oh , not at all .
go !
straighter , tommy !
you got to throw it straighter .
and hard .
one , two , three , go !
it's too heavy .
what?
on the back .
your airplane .
who asked you?
come on , bobby .
so , what's your opinion on modern art?
uh , it's hard to put into words really .
i i just know what i care for , and , and what i don't .
like this ...
i don't know how to pronounce it .
mira "?
mir .
mir .
i don't know why , but i just adore it .
a feeling it gives .
i know that sounds terribly vague .
no , no , actually it confirms something i've always wondered about modern art , abstract art .
what is that?
that perhaps it's just picking up where religious art left off , somehow trying to show you divinity .
the modern artistjust pares it down to the basic elements of shape and color .
but when you look at that mir , you feel it just the same .
why , that's lovely , raymond .
to tell the truth , i've always preferred the work of the masters .
rembrandt , michelangelo ...
would you excuse me a moment?
oh , certainly .
cathleen ...
oh , el , honey , everything looks just marvelous .
cathy , who on earth is that man?
you have this whole place in a clamor .
for heaven sakes why?
because of that ridiculous story?
who is he?
he's raymond deagan , otis deagan's son .
your gardener?
he passed away and raymond's taken over his business .
you certainly seem on familiar terms with him .
oh , " familiar terms " ...
what does that mean?
he happens to have some very interesting views on mir .
oh , jeepers , look at the time .
i have to fly .
i'm having the carpets cleaned for tomorrow ...
what time are the caterers showing?
they said 4 : 00 .
i'll come early , for moral support .
you're a doll .
so glad you could make it .
come in .
come in .
not to say that i'm against integration , mind you .
i do believe it's the christian thing to do .
but i still say what happened in little rock ... could just as easily have happened here in hartford .
nonsense .
well , why is that?
well , for one thing , there's no governor faubus in connecticut .
but the main reason , there are no negroes .
no , but there are some ... rather dangerous pro integration types right here in hartford .
dangerous?
oh , yes .
some very attractive ones , in fact , noted , i'm told , for their kindness to negroes .
oh , dick , stop .
where on earth did you hear about that?
shirley read it to me .
i should have known .
what's all this?
absolutely nothing .
now , let me freshen those .
excuse me , please .
thanks .
oh , by golly , there she is now , the " purtiest " gal in the room .
oh , stan , liquor brings out the texan in you .
i hope eleanor isn't listening .
so what if she is .
i still say frank is the luckiest guy in town .
hear !
hear !
it's all smoke and mirrors , fellas .
that's all it is .
you should see her without her face on .
frank !
no , he's absolutely right .
we ladies are never what we appear , and every girl as her secrets .
i'll say .
how about this girl getting her husband another drink?
darling , don't you think you've already had enough?
no , i don't think i've had enough ...
i'd just like to take a moment to raise a glass to our marvelous host and hostess ... and another glorious annual party at the whitakers .
to frank and cathy , truly mr. and mrs. magnatech .
hear !
hear !
my goodness .
thank you very much .
now , who can i freshen up?
ron?
no , i'm fine .
me .
oh , i think you're fresh enough .
all right .
here , mrs. whitaker , let me take that for you .
thank you , sybil .
cathy?
hi .
honey , is everything all right?
why?
what do you mean?
frank ...
i've never seen him so soused .
oh , he's been working so hard lately .
he's under tremendous strain .
you sure that's all?
oh , yes .
you'd tell me if there was anything more?
of course i would .
well , cathy ,
i think we just threw ourselves one class " a " swanky function .
it did turn out nicely , didn't it?
cathleen , darling , you've simply outdone yourself once again .
thank you so much .
frank?
well , if i do say so myself , it was a lovely party , all considering .
i just wish ... it didn't have to turn ugly ... in front of our friends .
honestly , frank , if you didn't insist on ...
what is it?
oh , frank .
oh , jesus .
oh , jesus !
what's happening?
i can't even ...
god !
frank , it doesn't matter .
the important thing is to keep , to keep trying .
don't !
what?
because ...
i'm sure , you know ,
dick dawson wouldn't mind lending his services every once in a while .
oh , frank .
i mean , you wouldn't mind that so much , would you?
a good looking guy like dick .
maybe even stan would pitch in .
frank , you're the only man that i've ever wanted .
just let go .
frank , frank , you're ...
you're all men to me .
you're all man .
stop it !
cathy .
cathy , i'm sorry .
oh .
i'm so sorry .
i didn't mean to .
it's all right .
i'm i'm all right .
it was an accident .
are you bleeding?
oh , just ... just the littlest bit .
perhaps , um , you could get me some ice , dear .
some ice?
yes .
cathy ...
i i know .
uh , um , it's all right .
i'm all right .
hey , there , hon .
listen .
i can't stay .
i'm meeting stan for lunch at the club .
oh , that sounds like fun .
can't believe i let you get away without these .
it's cute , your hair that way .
oh , yeah?
i experimented .
oh , it's adorable .
thanks .
oh .
whoopsie .
thanks .
cathy .
what?
what happened to your head?
oh , nothing .
i ...
i hit the door .
it was the silliest thing .
cathy .
what?
did something happen between you and frank?
what do you mean?
cathy , i'm your best friend .
nothing happened .
nothing at all .
oh , cathy .
eleanor .
cathy , i'm your dearest and closest friend in the world .
you call me ... day or night .
you hear?
mrs. whitaker?
is there anything i can do?
you sure?
i'm ...
i'm fine .
i just , um ...
i it's a difficult time [ sniffs ] with my husband .
oh .
it happens with married people .
i know it does .
i'm just ... it's just embarrassing .
please forgive me .
forgive you?
mrs. whitaker , listen .
i have to pick up some shrubs from a farmhousejust out of town .
which means i gotta get a move on .
why don't you come along for the ride?
some fresh air , change of scenery ... might help you take your mind of things .
ooh .
oh , no .
i , uh ... [ sniffles ]
i couldn't .
uh ...
thank you , raymond , for offering .
you're very kind .
you sure?
mrs. whitaker?
oh .
yes , sybil?
it's mrs. barker on the phone .
i'll be right there !
oh .
mm .
i have to get back .
okay .
oh , not at all .
um , well , i ...
i was planning on picking them up at 5 : 00 .
you'd like to switch for thursday?
i don't see why that would be a problem .
um , no .
i'm glad i could be of help .
certainly .
bye now .
raymond .
mrs. whitaker .
hi .
hello .
oh , wouldn't you know it .
i just received a call and suddenly everything's changed .
anyway , i ...
you changed your mind .
well , good .
thank you very much , mr. deagan .
thank you .
oh , it's lovely .
what is it?
hamamelis ... well , flowering witch hazel .
fairly rare in these parts .
it's beautiful .
you were right .
what a perfectly lovely spot .
is that a path?
i think so .
let's have a peek .
all right .
sometimes it's the people outside our world ... we confiide in best .
but once you do ... confide , share with someone , they're no longer really outside , are they?
oh .
look !
how lovely .
did he cause that?
he didn't mean to strike me .
i am so sorry .
no .
heaven knows we all have our troubles .
i'm sure you , yourself ...
what?
i don't know .
ever since running into you at the exhibition ,
i kept wondering what it must be like ... to be the only one in a room .
colored or ... whatever it was .
how that might possibly feel .
i'm sure i've ...
i've never ...
well ,
i suppose you sort of grow accustomed to it over time .
i mean , don't get me wrong .
there is a world , even here in hartford , where everybody does indeed look like me .
trouble is , very few people ever leave that world .
i only want what every father wants for his child .
the opportunities growing up i never had .
naturally .
but i tell you something .
if you're really interested ...
oh , i am .
you hungry?
i mean , could you eat something?
i suppose i could .
tell you what ,
i'm gonna take you to one of my favorite spots .
on good days , it's got hot food , cold drink , and just about discernable music .
it's hard to beat that .
there you go .
say , who's green edsel?
yoo hoo .
yoo hoo .
here i am .
oh .
there you are , ma'am .
let me get that for you .
oh .
thank you very much indeed .
thank you , ma'am .
oh , my god .
let me help you with that , ma'am .
oh .
thanks very much .

thank you .
i'm hardly dressed for a restaurant .
you look fine .
raymond .
don't worry .
this is a very friendly place .
say there , esther .
what , you can't say hello anymore?
looks like you speakin 'just fine for yourself .
oh , now you just sore because i haven't been coming around like i used to .
is that so?
mm hmm .
now what do you say about bringing us over a couple of drinks?
what would you like?
oh , uh , a daiquiri if they ...
one daiquiri and a bourbon on the rocks .
thank you , doll .
what do you think you're doing , boy?
thank you .
well , i hope you're finding this very amusing .
what do you mean?
this is a very welcoming place .
how you doin ', gus?
see what i mean?
thank you .
thank you , esther .
here's to being the only one .
you know , we don't have to stay here .
if you feel uncomfortable ...
no .
as long as i stay away from esther ,
i think i'll be fine .
all right then .
## " # " ## " # " [ slowjazz ]
thank you , raymond , for a lovely afternoon .
no .
thank you , mrs. whitaker .
i've had one as well .
mrs. whitaker sounds so formal .
would you ...
would i what?
ask me to dance?
## " # " ## " # " [ slowjazz continues ]
oh .
that looks wonderful .
now , let's see .
where should we put it?
oh .
i know .
right there .
right by the window .
yes .
yes .
that's lovely .
it certainly is .
oh .
now , let's see .
where did i put that list?
although i promised janice that i wouldn't be late for her recital .
can't miss that .
sybil , i've been meaning to ask you ...
yes , ma'am?
what's the name of that church group you belong to?
the one you mentioned to me .
you mean , at ebenezer?
the baptist group?
yes .
i believe that's it .
or was it south green baptist during the fair drive , the ladies auxiliary?
oh .
i didn't know there was more than one .
yes .
i always seem to be signing up for something .
i think that's marvelous , sybil , that you find the time with all you do for us .
i just have so much in the attic i've been meaning to go through .
i thought you might know of a church or civic organization ... that could use a donation .
well , certainly , mrs. whitaker , if that's what you're looking for .
places in need are never hard to find .
i'm sure you're right .
oh !
my .
hello .
may i help you?
good afternoon , ma'am .
allow me to introduce myself .
my name's reginald carter and this is martha livingston .
we're members of the hartford branch ... of the national association for the advancement of colored people .
oh , well , certainly , i am familiar with your organization .
perhaps you'd be interested in reading over our complimentary brochure .
mm .
yes .
i would .
if you wouldn't mind signing our roster ... [ phone rings ]
i'm running so terribly late as it is .
sybil , would you mind signing for me?
yes , ma'am .
thank you .
## " # " ## " # " [ ballet ]
mother !
hello , dear .
did the recital just begin?
shh !
so where are the other little girls from your class?
over there .
janice .
janice !
sybil?
hello .
cathy?
el?
oh , cathy .
thank heavens you're home .
i've been trying you all day .
el , what is it?
so you haven't heard?
you haven't heard a thing?
no .
what happened?
oh , cathy .
there's been talk .
vicious talk .
what do you mean?
about what?
about you?
oh , for heaven sake .
what now?
honey .
it's mona , cathy .
she's ...
well , she's just been on some kind of rampage , swearing up and down that she saw you and a colored man somewhere out on franklin .
getting out of a truck or some such thing .
the same colored man she claims you were talking to at the art show .
eleanor , that's ... that's preposterous .
i mean , yes , i've spoken to mr. deagan on occasion , but this makes it sound like ...
i know .
you have no idea what it's been like around here .
the phone has been ringing off the hook since 8 : 00 this morning .
eleanor , the entire situation is so absurd .
darling , i know .
what in the world am i supposed to do?
i suppose you could start by getting yourself another gardener .
frank?
what on earth ...
eleanor , could i call you back?
frank just walked in .
of course .
you go ahead .
i'll call you later .
frank?
what are you doing home?
is everything all right?
just tell me one goddamned thing .
what?
is it true , what they've been saying?
frank , i can't believe you even ...
because if it is , even in the slightest , i swear to god , cathleen ...
frank , i am sorry you even had to hear such nonsense .
yeah , well , dick dawson didn't seem to think it was such nonsense ... when he snuck away from his desk to phone me today .
good heavens .
he says the whole friggin 'town's talking !
frank , please .
sybil will hear you .
i sent her out !
christ , cathleen , do you even have the slightest idea about what this could mean?
don't you realize the effect it's gonna have on me ... and the reputation i have spent the past eight years trying to build ... for you and the children and for the company?
frank , i swear to you , whatever mona lauder saw or thought she saw ... was entirely a figment of that woman's hateful imagination .
yes .
i have spoken to raymond deagan on occasion .
he brought his little girl to eleanor's art show .
but ...
but , apparently , even here in hartford , the idea of a white woman even speaking to a colored man ...
oh , please !
just save me the negro rights !
you know what that woman is capable of !
and besides , i i've already given him notice ... and we ... we won't be seeing that man again .
fine .
is that why you came home ... because of what dick said?
did something happen at work?
frank .
tsk .
i guess you could call it some sort of early christmas bonus .
what do you mean?
a month of rest and relaxation .
can you imagine?
during the busiest season of the year .
what a goddamn honor .
but when you consider the bang up job i've been doing ... ever since good ol 'dr. bowman came on the scene ... and for being ...
what did millstein call it?
years overdue .
they do owe you a vacation after all you've given them .
palm springs is supposed to be nice .
so says the word on high .
i know it may not seem like it now , but a little time away , a vacation , might be the best thing ... for both of us .
frank , what a wretched day it must have been for you .
say , what do you know?
pop's home .
what you doin 'home , pop?
david , your father has work to do .
it's best you help yourself to a glass of milk and get started on your studies .
yes , mother .
say , pop ...
mind your mother , david .
yes , sir .
uh , say , mr. deagan ...
yes , jake?
there's a lady on the phone for you .
i'll be right there .
hello .
hello .
thank you for meeting me .
i realize you have a busy schedule .
worked out fine .
i was glad you called .
are you sure everything's all right?
uh , is there something i can do for you folks?
can we leave here?
of course .
what is it?
what happened?
i wanted to see you in person , raymond .
i ...
i just ...
i can't .
can't what?
it isn't plausible for me to be friends with you .
you've been so very kind to me and i've been perfectly reckless and foolish in return , thinking ...
thinking what?
that one person could reach out to another , take an interest in another ... and maybe for one fleeting instant ... could manage to see beyond the surface , beyond the color of things?
do you think we ever really do ... see beyond those things ... the surface of things?
just beyond the fall of grace , behold that ever shining place .
yes .
i do .
i don't really have a choice .
i wish i could .
good luck to you , raymond .
mrs. whitaker .
you !
boy !
hands off !
yeah !
you !
raymond , please don't .
you're so beautiful .
come on , dear .
oh !
it is them !
it is !
thank you , mother .
thank you , father .
mwah !
oh ho .
merry christmas , sweetheart .
now i'll be as good as all the other girls in class .

well , what have we here?
bermuda .
acapulco .
rio .
miami .
take your pick .
it's your choice .
mother , will you help me lace up my slippers?
in a minute , dear .
i don't know .
stan is always raving about miami .
oh , frank .
miami would be a dream .
el says it's just darling .
everything's pink .
oh , really?
hmm .
maybe we oughta consider bermuda .
oh , frank !
i do love you , darling .

why , yes .
very much .

but why?
because i said so .
here comes kenny .
i was looking for you on the other side .
i tell you , we're gonna have to start meeting points .
that does it .
i've had quite enough fashion advice for the afternoon .
i do believe it's time for my miss mitchell .
oh , heavens .
what?
i think i left it upstairs .
so silly .
you want me to go get it?
no .
you just sat down .
oh , no .
i don't mind .
you sure?
yeah .
i have to get a paper anyway .

i think it's right there on the nightstand .

welcome home , mr. and mrs. whitaker .
oh , my goodness .
what a lovely greeting .
hiya , pop .
hey , mother .
hey .
so , mother , was it dreamy?
oh ho .
listen to you .
dreamy .
did you have a nice time , mr. whitaker?
yes .
it was very relaxing .
say , pop ...
david , help sybil with the luggage please .
pop , you'll never guess what happened at school this week .
try and guess .
david .
uh , i give up .
i'm helping , mother .
billy hutchinson and these two other boys ... all got expelled from school .
i think you mean " suspended .
no .
expelled . " i swear .
for throwing a rock at a girl's head .
that's terrible .
a little girl at school?
no .
she was a negro .
what?
who told you such a thing?
tommy hawkins .
he saw it , so he had to tell the principal .
sybil , is this true?
yes , ma'am .
i'm afraid it is .
what on earth has gotten into this town?
it was just a couple of foolish kids .
yeah .
hutch said that they were just trying to teach her a lesson .
well , i think it's dreadful , and you're not to play with that hutch boy again , understand me?
yes , ma'am .
david , while you're up , how about flippin'on the set for your old man?
sure , pop .
mother , how do you spell " skirt "?
uh , just a minute , dear .
mother's making a call .
oh .
yes .
hello .
um , i was wondering if you could help me possibly .
i just received your brochure , which i found extremely informative , and i was curious about what was entailed , precisely , in your ... in your volunteer program in terms of particular skills and so on .
you see , i ...
oh .
oh , yes .
i can hold .
father's home .
frank .
what happened to the match?
oh , my , um , shoulder .
it started acting up .
i ...
i just couldn't sit there any longer .
you didn't say anything .
father , i did the splits today .
wanna see?
janice , your father just walked in the door ... and you have schoolwork to finish .
yes , mother .
you know , frank , you never had that physical .
and i think you're due for one .
can i call dr. ellis?
you know , it's been three years .
oh .
did i tell you that the pediatrician thinks that janice is going to need braces?
father , do i have to?
apparently , our little girl has an overbite .
pop , you'll never guess what i'm doing .
where is your coat?
it's in the garage .
i'm waxing pop's car .
and what's it doing there?
it's gonna look swell , pop .
how many times do i have to tell you children you are not permitted outdoors ... in this kind of weather unless you are properly dressed?
yes , ma'am .
because i give up .
if you wanna go and catch your death of cold , then so be it .
you try talking some sense into them , frank , because whatever i say doesn't ...
frank?
what's the matter?
god .
david , janice , go upstairs to your rooms .
now .
now !
frank .
what is it?
cathy , [ sobs ]
something's happened .
what?
i've fallen in love with someone ...
who wants to be with me .
oh , cathy ,
i i i just ...
i ...
i never knew what that felt ...
but i know that sounds so cruel , but ... oh , god .
cathy , i tried .
i tried so hard to make it go away .
it ...
it ...
i thought that i could do it ... for you and for the kids .
but ...
i can't .
i just ...
i can't .
i can't .
i , um , assume then , you'll be ...
wanting a divorce .
cathy .
eleanor .
eleanor , it's me , cathy .
oh , cathy .
so you see , el , why i couldn't tell you anything ... anything at all .
oh , you dear sweet kid .
in a million years , i couldn't have imagined .
not frank .
i think that's what's been hardest of all .
the endless secrecy .
our entire lives just shut in the dark .
are there savings?
none to speak of .
certainly not with frank's job on the line .
well , honey , if there's anything you need , anything at all ...
oh , el .
i mean it .
we're here , all right?
thank you , el , for always having been .
you know , it's funny .
what's that?
this whole time , the only person i was able to talk to about any of this ... was raymond deagan .
what?
it's true .
not in the way that mona intended .
nothing like that .
but we would just talk .
and somehow , it made me feel ...
i don't know .
alive somewhere .
eleanor , i know it's ridiculous and mad , but i ...
i think of him .
i do .
what he's doing .
what he's thinking .
i ...
i do .
el?
what can i say?
you're so full of surprises , i'm speechless .
what do you mean?
i'm sure i must've looked entirely the fool ... crusading away against mona lauder and all her so called inventions .
eleanor , how could you say such a thing?
i didn't say a word .
who am i to tell anyone how to lead their lives?
eleanor , nothing happened between us .
i told you that .
cathy , it's none of my business , but you certainly make it sound as if something had .
mrs. whitaker?
oh .
sybil .
i'm sorry to disturb you , ma'am .
i i just ...
yes , sybil?
there's something i've been wanting to tell you , ma'am , for some time .
something i believe you surely wanna know , even if it isn't exactly my place .
well , what is it?
it's about the little colored girl , ma'am .
the one that got hit .
yes .
what about her?
i'm sorry , ma'am .
it was mr. deagan's little girl , sarah .
what?
oh , sybil .
no .
the neighbors tell me she's doing just fine .
oh , that poor sweet little girl .
that ...
how in god's name could you not have told me , sybil?
this was weeks ago !
mrs. whitaker , please don't be cross with me .
i didn't wanna make things any worse .
sybil , do you know where mr. deagan lives?
i believe he's been at his father's old place on 12th and governor .
twelfth and governor .
thank you .
are you going there now?
please keep an eye on the children .
i shouldn't be too long .
mrs. whitaker .
what?
would you like me to go with you , ma'am?
no .
no , i'll be fine .
thank you , sybil .
who on earth?
yes .
raymond , i ...
i just heard .
just this instant .
i heard and i jumped into my car .
how are you?
how is sarah?
we're fine .
thank you .
would you meet me around the side?
sarah , everything's all right .
daddy's just gonna be out for a minute , okay?
okay .
raymond .
what she must've been through .
what's being done to the boys?
nothing .
i won't put her through that again .
not now .
not with rocks coming through the windows every night .
raymond , that's hateful .
oh , it's not whites throwin 'them .
it's coloreds .
no .
yeah .
seems to be the one place where whites and coloreds are in full harmony .
anyway , we'll be outta here soon enough once and for all .
you're moving?
yeah .
where to?
i have a brother in baltimore , says he can find me work there .
so we're packing up the house .
two weeks , friday , we'll be on the 4 : 30 train heading south .
what about your ... your business , your shop?
oh , the business is through .
nobody's gonna hire me .
so i'm gonna sell the shop to a cousin of mine .
yeah .
things are ... pretty well finished for me here .
i've never lived anywhere other than hartford .
perhaps ... sometime in the future ... after you're settled , i could ...
perhaps i could come for a visit , see baltimore .
you see , i ...
well , it seems as if i'm to be single again .
oh , mrs. whitaker .
please call me cathy .
cathy .
no one would know us there .
i'm just not sure that would be a wise idea .
after , well , everything that's ...
what matters now , what has to matter the most , is what's right for sarah .
i've learned my lesson about mixing in other worlds .
i've seen the sparks fly .
all kinds .
have a proud life .
a splendid life .
will you do that?
good bye , cathy .
hello .
cathy , did i wake you?
i i'm sorry to call this late .
i hope i didn't , uh ...
uh , no .
i was awake .
i , uh , didn't want to upset the children .
no .
no , of course not .
how are they , by the way?
fine .
just fine .
they still ask when you'll be coming home .
i know .
that's , uh , partly why i'm calling really .
i got a call from dick yesterday ... and he said that everything was set , um , papers drawn up .
and he wanted to know how thursday was for you .
3 : 00 or sometime?
i ...
i told him i thought you had car pool thursdays , but i wasn't absolutely certain , so i said i would check .
you never could remember my car pool days .
and they've always been the same .
wednesdays and fridays , long as i can remember .
oh , wednesdays and fridays .
right .
uh ...
same old absentminded ...
what time ... did you say on thursday?
what?
the appointment .
what time?
three .
uh , three o'clock .
all right .
okay .
uh , well ... great .
that ...
that was it , uh , really .
i ... [ clears throat ]
know it's late .
it is .
so i'll see you on ... on thursday then .
see you thursday .
good bye , cathy .
good bye , frank .
sixty seven dollars and thirty two cents .
now , what day is today?
oh , sybil .
