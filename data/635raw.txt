i cant hold her much ionger .
shes taking on too much water .
what is going on back there?
keep your pants on , murphy .
we blew the starboard engine .
port engines way too hot .
hold on .
shorten the tow or cut her ioose .
epps ... ... get off my damn tugboat .
we dont have much time .
move it , epps .
if she sinks , shes taking us with her .
got a punch in the port floater .
five minutes before she floods .
less than that !
get back here .
were cutting her ioose .
cut her ioose .
thats it .
get back here .
come on !
you heard the man !
took us three months to get her off the bottom .
i wiii not iose her now !
goddamn it , epps !
you cant fix everything !
christ !
for the last time , get back here !
shes taking on too much water !
why do you always have to break my balls?
i said get back here !
do you want me to come down there and kick your ass?
because iil do it .
heres to the best damn salvage crew in the business !
we did it , guys !
yeah , iook at that !
aii right .
nice work .
heres to the fucking sea !
to the sea .
to a job weii done .
mr. murphy?
im jack ferriman .
i was wondering if i could buy you a drink .
he doesnt drink .
could i talk to you alone?
you talk to me , you talk to my crew .
thats the way it is .
i fly the arctic weather patroi flights out of mackenzie bay .
last month i was out in the middle of the strait when i came across this .
congratulations .
you found a boat .
in the middle of the ocean , of aii places .
i tried for radio contact and got nothing ... ... so i figured she had to be adrift .
in the bering strait?
thats miles from shipping ianes .
did you alert the coast guard?
its internationai waters , so they noted it and thats it .
you get a name?
no , i put it out of my head untii two days ago when i saw it again .
what are we talking about?
what kind of tonnage?
big .
huge .
could be military .
lets say that were a iittle bit interested .
whats in it for you?
i want 20 % finders fee , whatever shes worth .
have you told anyone else about this?
not a iiving soul .
give us a minute , wiii you?
okay .
so?
what do you think , murph?
who knows?
could be fuii of shit .
i do know one thing .
ive seen strange things happen in the strait .
sea gives you an opportunity , take it .
thats at ieast a week out of our way .
weve been out for six months already .
i got a fiance waiting , remember?
im getting married in a month .
plan was to go back to anchorage .
starboard diesei needs an overhaul .
there is no plan .
if you dont want to go , thats fine .
lets teii him weii get somebody else .
wait a minute .
lets not be hasty .
whats a ship iike that worth?
who knows?
miilions?
thousands?
could be nothing .
depends on a iot of things .
mainly , if we have the right to salvage .
pretty big " if .
whats the split?
we split it even , six ways .
even split?
beats me paying you overtime .
im good .
im in .
greer?
what do you say?
aii right .
hey , ferriman !
can you come over here?
so this is the way it works .
1 0 % instead of your 20 % finders fee .
i cant iet you take advantage of me iike that .
thats the way it is .
take it or ieave it .
fine .
but i go with you .
not on my boat , you dont .
think id teii you where a fortune might be without insurance?
there are five other boats that would jump at this .
i come with you .
so you take it or ieave it .
things are duil !
sheii love it .
what do you think?
too much off the sides , but i can come up with something sheii iove .
shave that yourself .
dont want to help me out?
who the fuck are you kidding?
everybody knows you navy boys take it up the ass .
enjoying the ride , jack?
no , sir .
not the same as flying planes over ice sheets , is it?
whats the appeal?
i could ask you the same thing .
whats a nice giri doing in a dump iike this instead of raising a family?
i own a third of murphys operation .
im not that nice .
and these monkeys are my family .
santos to murphy .

lets get to it .
hey , check this out .
its a watch .
congratulations , buddy .
no .
look again , you moron .
its a digitai watch .
do the math .
they didnt have digitai watches in 1 962 .
so were not the first people to board this ship .
but shes ours now .
lets get some sleep , tow her at dawn .
lets hope theres no more surprises .
amen to that .
oh , god .
epps , can i get some tea?
any sign of what mightve happened?
how she got here?
thats the $64 miilion question , isnt it?
ever hear of a ship cailed the marie celeste?
twin masted brigantine out of charleston during the civii war .
she was bound for london with a cargo of cotton .
thanks .
two months after she set sail , she was sighted by fishermen off tripoli .
she was doing 1 2 knots an hour in a stiff breeze .
something wasnt quite right .
they didnt know what so they went onboard .
you know what they found?
nothing .
no passengers .
no crew .
no captain .
no sign of distress .
59 days after the iast iog entry , it had traveled 4500 miles across the ocean ... ... past the rock of gibraltar and into the mediterranean sea at fuii sail .
and nobody at the helm .
what do you make of that?
a ghost ship .
hey , you smeii that?
i smeii builshit .
been on the sea a iot ionger than you .
i know .
seen things that you cant even imagine .
maritime history is fuii of marie celestes .
so , whats our plan?
i think we should do what we came to do .
tie her up , tug her in .
you think our iittle tug wiii puii this entire ocean iiner?
not with the problems we got .
we could set her at anchor and come back with two or three tugs .
no , some russian trawler wiii come along .
ive already iooked for her anchors , anyway .
theyre gone .
what do you think?
get the engines working ... ... it could take us two weeks minimum to tow a vessei this size .
for my share of what shes worth , id drag her back to anchorage myself .
dont iet go !
help me !
dont iet go !
thought you might want a jacket .
thanks .
boy , do i miss that .
you okay?
you seem quiet since you came back .
i think i saw something i couldnt possibly have seen .
like what?
no , its crazy .
im curious .
teii me .
i think i saw a iittle girl .
on ....
on the ....
the boat?
yeah .
looking right at me .
and then what happened?
nothing .
she disappeared .
sometimes , when id be flying for hours on end ... ... id think id see stuff too .
itd be there one second and gone the next .
like a dream .
thanks .
see you in the a . m .
okay .
good night .
see you tomorrow .
yeah .
shes got a big hole .
shes sinking .
this is where the damage is .
see?
breach in the huil , about 1 0 by 20 ...
... torn to the port coilision bulkhead .
did it hit an iceberg?
no , you dont need an iceberg to rupture a huil .
shes been hit recently .
about a week ago , id say .
this is where we are .
the problems this group of islands .
nothing spectacular ... ... just rocks , a couple thousand seals .
the antonia grazas caught here in this strong current ioop ... ... and slowly shes been pushed towards those rocks .
last time she hit them .
what about next time?
wont be one .
weve got three days to fix it .
thats if the weather holds .
why cant we tow it iike it is?
itd be iike towing a car with four flat tires .
its a bump in the road .
we can fix it .
murph , bump in the road?
the breach we can probably patch if we can get to the inside .
weii weld shut the flooded compartments , pump out the water up to the aft peak .
on top of that , the rudders jammed .
we jerry rig it , set a 38 degree current drift to clear the island chain .
what does aii that mean?
i just thats a iot of work for three days .
but with the gear weve got onboard and whats on that ship , we can try .
we can do it , right?
with the gear weve got onboard , i cant fix our engine .
quit bitching and overhaui the starboard engine .
so thats the plan?
just do it .
iii caii it in .
i wouldnt do that if i were you .
maritime iaw states  i know .
we just dont want any unexpected guests .
just ieave it .
your cail , captain .
aii right , you know the driil .
we do a complete recon .
make sure weve got no problems before we get to work .
stay with me , greer .
dont wander .
okay .
dodge , munder , go to the port coilision bulkhead .
jack and iii work back from the fore .
caii if you need anything .
how about a pizza?
youre so funny .
the only plan in this business is that there is no plan .
what is that?
what these people talking crazy for?
thats not even good english .
hang in there , okay , preciosa?
because someday heii find some other genius to fix his boat .
you want to play iike that?
its stiii sweet , though .
light coming up .
you were right .
she is beautiful .
she sure is .
epps , were heading for the main engine room .
epps?
aii right , capitano .
oh , shit .
were gonna have to dive to get to that tear .
epps , the engine room is totaily flooded .
epps , can you hear me?
wait !
what happened?
you okay?
what are you doing down there?
did you hurt yourself?
what are you doing?
the whole bottoms riddled with them .
looks iike someone used it for target practice .
thats the happy version .
whats the not so happy version?
there were people in there .
i saw that iittle giri again .

where?
i must be iosing my goddamn mind .
weil , did she say anything?
forget it .
come on .
murphy , come in .

we need to see if its flooded .
i may need help shutting it .

murphy , where the heii are you?
how iong have they been here?

they gotta be insured .
no way somebody wiii iet this much gold float away .
weil , the markings have been filed down .
what does that mean?
someone didnt want this traceable .
its stolen .
it may have to do with the reason this ship disappeared when it did .
wait .
if the golds got something to do with 1 962 ... ... what about the bodies?
they cant be more than three weeks old .
somebodys gotta say it , and it might as weii be me .
this ship is fucked up .

maybe youre not quite ready to get married , greer .
fuck you .
okay , guys .
what about the coast guard?
