i'm getting a bad feeling about this .
you don't wanna get engaged now?
please don't be mad .
but i think we should take some time off .
away from each other .
think things through .
for what?
everything between us is too right .
too easy .
never dramatic .
what are you talking about?
i'm 25 years old and still waiting for that , you know , grand passion .
i mean , it's not your fault .
you just don't do grand .
you don't do sweeping , romantic gestures .
look , i wanna marry you .
i wanna spend the rest of my life with you .
ain't that grand and sweeping?
at least sweeping?

i need to be away from you for a while .

lord , have mercy .
quincy .
quincy .
what are you doing?
hey , mr. gascon .
hey .
you got a handle on it?
a handle on what?
on the firing .
yeah .
i've researched .
got everything together .
okay .
all right .
excellent .
yeah , yeah .
all right , here you go .
okay .
all right .
i see names .
what is?
what is this?
yeah .
well ... ... it's just a little hands on experience .
right .
i don't understand what you're talking about .
come on .
what?
don't go daft on me here .
i'm not .
yeah .
it's a list of people who need to be ...
... fired .
what?
you want me to do it?
of course .
you're the expert .
no , wait a minute .
i was just doing the research .
i didn't know you were about to fire people .
yeah .
no , no .
well , see , i thought i was clear .
no , no .
well , then that's my error .
all right .
sorry .
sorry .
okay .
okay .
well , let me know how it goes .
mr. gascon , listen .
i am not comfortable with this .
well , of course not .
to feel comfortable , you'd have to be a monster .
yeah , yeah .
no , you're no monster .
neither am l .
right , right .
i just happen to be in the position ... ... to delegate , and you are not .
hey , good luck .
quincy .
what's happening , man?
hey , nothing .
you look awful .
thanks .
looks like it was quite a blowout .
yeah , i was blown out .
all right .
so , what's up?
this and that .
this and that?
yeah .
sandra said you wanted to see me .
yeah .
so it's like that , huh?
look ....
that's cool .
shit !
make sure mr. gascon gets this .
sure .
q.
q. come on , open up the door , man .
oh , q. man , what you wearing , q?
you know , it feels good on my skin .
you gonna let me in?
what you want?
that's for what .
your mother , my auntie's been calling me ... ... every day early for a week .
she's worried about you .
you can't call her?
been busy .
you been busy?
i've been busy .
move out  watch the piss .
what's that?
you so in a hurry , you ain't looking .
oh , no .
no , no , no .
see , this is disturbing , q.
kind of a mess , huh?
it's like an outer extension of disease .
where's your stuff?
helen , you know , she took some stuff .
took a tv .
left me with the dog and a half naked picture of herself .
just evil .
i gave her everything but my soul .
and i bet they want that too .
just greedy .
don't give it to them .
all you gotta do is pretend to give it to them .
why do i have to pretend?
why can't i just be me?
nobody finds pathetic charming .
was that cheese?
okay , look , i'm sorry about helen , okay?
but you got to pull yourself together , bro .
i been writing .
you been writing?
letters to helen .
a few letters .
how many letters , q?
i could not get the right tone .
no , how many letters?
i just kept obsessing over the way she left me and what she told me .
then it came to me , with my employee termination research ... ... that if helen was my boss , then the way she fired me was bad ... ... bad in every way .
public humiliation , conflicting messages , horrific timing .
oh , yeah , i wrote a letter .
i wrote a letter detailing the disgust i have at her method and technique .
her method and her technique for dumping you?
exactly .
oh , okay , man .
where is this letter?
i'm calling your mom .
wait .
no , that is a scream for help .
i'm calling your mother .
it started out as a letter , then it evolved into a manual .
a manual on how to break up with a lover ... ... based on psychological and employee termination research .
you're telling me you don't find any of this strange?
what's strange , huh?
what's strange about it?
when you break up with somebody , and firing somebody's the same ... ... you wanna do it the easiest way without producing a stalker .
i call it the plan .
the plan?
the plan .
it is brilliant .
you got a table of contents?
i don't believe him .
committed or committable?
time to kill .
location , location .
why break up at her place?
you control the duration of the breakup , leave when you want .
a person can follow you if you're at a bar , restaurant or hotel .
but ain't nobody leaving their own apartment .
and the answering machine?
change the outgoing message ... ... to the mechanical one because a breakup ee will call the breakup er ... ... just to hear their voice and then hang up .
and what that does , it creates a cycle of emotional desperation ... ... especially if the message says , " i'm not here .
i'm in paris ....
you see , to me , falling in love is blissful insanity .
but breaking up , that's a rational act .
now , how do we improve upon that rational act?
we do it through science .
what were you planning on doing with this?
i'm ....
i got a betty i been seeing for three months .
chapter 6 .
yeah .
what's?
capricorn?
aries .
oh , yeah .
you wanna take this on a field test .
quincy?
we're gonna be rich , bro .
we are gonna be so incredibly rich .
how to dress .
how to act .
what to wear .
what not to wear .
all i've done is just research and realize that you can break up ... ... but improve on it by the science .
that's my boyfriend's cousin there .
who's that , honey?
the guy on tv , talking about the book he wrote on how to break up .
not exactly leading us out of the dark ages , is he?
he's kind of cute , though .
what's he like?
i don't know .
i never met him .
but i know he is one lonely puppy .
why do you say that?
what woman would go out with a guy whose expertise is dumping people?
you got a point .
okay , here we go .
what's your love life like?
are you seeing anyone?
give me a second .
so , what do you want me to do?
something drastic .
i've been seeing evan for three months ... ... and i really like him , but he's getting a bit twitchy .
you know how the fine ones are .
i think i need to shock him .
i need to shock myself .
i had that dream again .
the one with the straps?
no .
the one with halle berry .
so ....
dreaming of halle before a haircut ... ... is as clear a sign you're gonna get in this lifetime .
how does it feel to be in the building as an author and not a slave?
i can wait by philip's office .
i don't want you to be lonely .
lonely?
you gotta get out more ... ... because it's depressing seeing you .
a fan wrote me a letter , said i was arrogant .
no , no .
let me tell you something .
you have supplied ...
... a humanitarian service to the world .
no .
no , listen to me .
you should feel good about that .
how is anybody gonna find their one true love ... ... when they're stuck in a bunch of dead end relationships?
quincy ...
... you are a love enabler .
i just need somebody normal .
oh , see , there you go .
there are no normal relationships .
you know why?
because there are no normal women .
you know what?
a girl came to my crib .
never seen her before .
says that she dug the book .
whoa , whoa , whoa .
wait .
a groupie .
oh , my boy had his first groupie .
groupies are there to please , okay .
they're there to do whatever , whenever , however you want , kid .
i couldn't close the deal .
oh , q !
don't tell me that , man .
do you know what i'd do to get with a groupie?
lf it happens again , you can pretend you're me .
i'm gonna do that .
i gotta meet up with nicky later .
you wanna check her out?
nope .
how many weeks she got left?
technically , her time's almost up .
but she's a little freaky .
so ....
you like her .
no .
you gazed into just midair .
no , i ....
when you like people , you gaze .
all right , you know what it is?
she has this long , black , thick , sexy , sexy hair .
just got the weirdest pain in my nuts .
i don't want to be staring at that .
anyway , you'd like her , q. she does physical therapy at the hospital .
you know , she's bright .
mulatto?
no , no .
a little cinnamon .
okay .
bright like smart .
yeah , bright like smart .
she's tough .
she has body and that long , long , black hair .
oh , shit , there it is again .
boy , you are too old to be having the crabs .
you been putting that where you ain't supposed to?
it's a very social organ , but ....
yo .
he's ready for you .
okay .
all i'm saying is that one day a girl's gonna dump you ... ... before you dump her .
it's gonna have you very eric bent : sensitive .
don't jinx me .
i'm not jinxing you .
she's gonna hide things from you .
baby , i think we need to talk .
respond to the door .
okay , fine .
i'm out .
twist it , respond , out .

hey .
hey .

king author , baby .
king author .

well , yeah .

i'm seeing the whole line now of spoil books .
spoil's guide to sex .
spoil's guide to golf .
spoil's guide to pimping .
i'm branding the whole damn world .
yeah .
okay .
guess you're wondering why i asked you up here .
yeah , why am i here?
okay , just why don't you sit .
let me just put it right out on the table .
i need your help .
with what?
firing somebody .
which is not the right word .
more " letting go , " " getting rid of , " " losing .
another employee?
it's my girlfriend .
you want me to help you fire your girl?
well , no , if only you could .
no , no .
i've gotta do this myself .
i'm not gonna delegate this .
i would if i could , but i can't .
it's just ... ... l am at my wit's end .
this woman god , she has a power over me .
just a it's like a voodoo , hoodoo , she do !
she's got me .
i am i'm not in control .
no .
this is not me .
hi , it's sandra .

mr. gascon has brought in a ringer .
i need a professional .
breakup professional?
breakup professional .

you've got to help me .
no , it's a disaster .
my god .
amy , i look like a bigheaded alien .

no , i don't know what i did .
it's ugly .
oh , jesus .
would you stop with the " perfect couple " crap?

nicky .
nicky .

we're gonna be late .
did you hear me?
i'm not coming out .

i'm never coming out .
what are you doing up there?
nothing .
you're doing nothing in the bedroom?
yeah .
and why are you never coming out?
because i'm hiding .
and why are you hiding?

she tried to break up with me .
what?
what? " she was being evasive and she was hiding ... ... and you know what she said to me?
baby , we need to talk .
yeah , that sounds familiar , don't it?
what did you say?
what do you mean?
i preempted the strike .
i ran .
you was gonna break up anyway .
i was gonna break up with her .
you feeling that?
i with her .
there's a world of difference .
but it's cool because i have a plan .

chapter 3 .
chapter 3 .
you been reading .
come on .
that's why you're nervous .
nicky?
maybe .
maybe not , huh?
what is your name?
no , i'm not nicky .
sorry .
okay , that's the wrong name .
excuse me .
quincy .
did you ask me my name?
no .
you didn't just ...?
okay , well , my name is quincy .
okay .
mary .
mary , nice to meet you .
i was actually here because my cousin sent me to find his girlfriend .
she has long hair .
i never realized how many women ... ... in l. a. had long hair .
no other distinguishing characteristics like a scar or a tattoo ...
... dimples or something?
pretty smile .
no , not to my knowledge .
maybe her description of you is more detailed than yours of her .
she doesn't know me .
she thinks she's coming to meet her boyfriend .
but she's not?
no , no .
my cousin sent me because ... ... for some reason , he is terrified she's gonna break up with him .
why would he think that?
because she wants to talk .
he ever think she'd wanna talk about something else?
you know women when they just want to talk .
you guys , when y'all wanna talk , y'all talk .
and y'all talking .
just talky talk .
we're funny like that .
really .
what'd he expect you to do about it?
he wants me to chat her up ... ... tell her how great of a guy he is .
that's really high school .
i said the same thing .
and the cold part is i gotta lie .
he ain't great .
what do you mean?
he's a misogynist .
he's a player , you know?
and he has a three month commitment clause .
really?
yeah , yeah .
no , a firm policy .
sounds like a real peach .
even within the three months ... ... he messes with other girls anyway .
so i'm like , " what's the deal?
yeah , what is the deal?
enough .
want a drink?
yeah , a bloody mary .
can i get a double , please?
mary likes bloody marys .
that's cute .
yeah .
so , quincy , what is it that you do?
i am an editor for spoil magazine .
really?
wow .
you know , you remind me of someone .
you remind me of somebody too .
really?
halle berry .
you got that .
thanks .
yeah .
q.
no show .
damn .
that's a sign , isn't it?
like a flashing red light before a cliff .
wanna go get something to drink , man?
i can't , man .
i just met this babe .
we might go get some dinner and a club later .
i didn't mention that i wrote the book .
ls that dishonest?
you're on a date .
it's all dishonest .
all right .
strange .
you were gonna meet your date , i was gonna meet mine .
and we meet each other at the same time .
strange .
that's not strange .
no?
no .
you wanna hear strange?
give me strange .
teratomas .
that's them little cookies?
they come in a package?
that's tiramisu .
teratomas .
they're tumors that can grow inside our bodies ... ... formed by all three embryonic precursors .
what does that mean?
it means that they have hair ... ... and skin and glands , so they sweat like you are now , and brain tissue .
i saw one pulled out of a woman the size of a basketball .
and when they cut it open , she had a full row of teeth .
all the stuff that comes together to form human life are there .
but somehow they dissemble into something hideous .
it's crazy .
so , what's the strangest thing that you know?
can't bite through your own skin .
what?
it's impossible .
first law of nature : self preservation .
you can't do it , because you're selfish .
i can't bite through my own flesh , because i'm too selfish?
try to .
no .
bite into yourself .
that's lame .
bite yourself .
all right .
you want some hot sauce?
i can't bite into my skin , because i'm sane .
it's the same thing , biologically speaking .
see , if you're not selfish ... ... that means you're crazy and you could do it .
what about if you care about someone more than you care about yourself?
first , why would you do that?
second , are you talking about love?
yeah .
love .
lf someone is in love , therefore not selfish , then he or she is crazy ... ... and could bite through his or her own flesh .
so being in love and being crazy are one and the same?
it's obvious .
wanna bite your other hand?
no .
wanna bite me?
i'm tender .
i'm moist .
i'm loving .
hello .
quincy watson , i presume?
yeah .
yeah , that's me .
quincy .
quincy watson .
what's up?
come on .
i'm rita monroe .
oh , yes , you are , rita .
that's his way of saying hello .
oh , god .
hello , rita .
drink?
you do know why i'm here?
i do know .
i do .
do?
do l?
do i know why?
one second .
so you read my book?
i'm familiar with it .
i'm also familiar with the fact that you plan ... ... on giving my philip breakup pointers .
not a very good idea .
i'm completely ....
everyone has a job , and mine is to become mrs. philip gascon .
i'm sorry .
you were saying?
i'm saying that i think we need to work some things out .
one professional to another .
professional?
don't be under any illusions .
it's not all love .
it's not love .
i think i understand now .
i'm sorry .
i'm sorry .
i wasn't expecting you to be so
what?
so honest?
straightforward .
there's no need for us to work against each other on this .
you wanna talk compensation?
wow .
very direct .
was i too fast for you?
no .
i'm just used to placating ... ... scared little rabbits , you know?
i'm not used to doing business with a real man .
i need to find an atm .
oh , what the hell?
look at the town drunk .
where am l?
you're in my living room .
what kind of man corrupts another man's dog?
you see a woman around?
you that freaky ... ... you need help to get a dog drunk?
what you do to the dog?
i'm gonna report you .
it's not your dog , it's your ex's .
lf helen came home now and saw an alcoholic pug , what would she say?
you can't let pugs drink , they're not rottweilers .
they got little bitty kidneys .
helen's not coming back .
it ain't about helen .
no .
and it's definitely not about the dog .
i don't know what kind of freaky stuff you got my drawers on?
mr. lynch , i've told you ... ... don't take your clothes off for therapy .
hold my dick .
okay .
i'll come back when you get dressed .
dr. jacobs , call 2035 .
evan called .
one o'clock , your place .
a little afternoon delight?
oh , he's so romantic .
you guys are the reason i date .
he thinks i'm breaking up with him .
he's freaking out .
are you?
no , or i wasn't .
then i went on a date with quincy , who thinks i'm mary .
and found out that if true , evan is satan .
not that quincy's reliable , given he lied about ... ... what he does or did in writing that book .
but he did seem sincere , and there's the craziest freaking attraction that's
oh , god .
so i guess the answer's yes .
yes , what?
i'm dumping evan's ass for lunch .
hey .
you're late .
what are we doing way out here?
spies .
i don't think you fully realize the seriousness of the situation i'm in .
i got techniques for you so good you will never worry about this girl again .
now , what's the plan?
early supper , maybe a dvd back at my place .
can we get the dvd at her place?
her place .
now , what do i say?
nothing .
nothing?
it's what you do .
well , what do i do?
you sulk .
pardon?
and then eventually , she will ask you ....
what's wrong?
then you will respond by saying ... ... nothing .
come on , come on .
honey , something must be wrong .
no , nothing .
something is obviously wrong .
no , it's nothing .
tell me .
please tell me what's bothering you .
now you got her .
she's desperate .
hit her right between the eyes .
well , if you must know , i wanna break up .
wait a second .
just like that?
i call it the passive aggressive bullet to the head .
she feels responsible .
then eventually , she'll squeak out , " but why?
and then you just look right in her eyes and say , " hey , i don't love you .
and then you bounce .
wow .
well , it sounds a bit cruel .
it's less cruel than a bad relationship .
now , i'm gonna give you these .
okay?
that reminds you who you are .
you're hard metal .
you're steel .
i still don't know why we couldn't go to your place .
i like the smell of new paint .
drink?
no , thank you .
you look like you swallowed a spider .
i didn't just swallow a spider .
a rat?
no .
wanna know what it is?
what you swallowed?
why i am sulking?
it just looks like you're constipated .
no .
i explained to you that i was sulking .
because you're constipated .
when was the last movement?
it's not about that .
you want to know what it's about?
no .
well , why not?
because you look so cute .
there's something on my mind .
something you should know .
philip , rub my leg .
i have a cramp .
don't you wanna know what's on my mind?
rub my leg first .
higher .
higher .
what's on your mind , big boy?
let's go .
it's open .
you cut your hair .
i know .
no , but i mean , like , you really cut your hair .
i mean , you look like that actress .
halle berry .
no , not halle berry , please .
no .
the actress in that movie about the crack addicts .
that's who you look like .
like a crackhead?
it doesn't matter , because , you know ...
... that's one hell of a cut .
so , what , you like it?
no , i hate it .
that's good .
it makes it so much easier .
i wanna break up .
what?
yeah .
what? " i wanna break up .
you can't break up with me .
i'm supposed to break up with your ass .
well ....
apparently not .
this is so unfair .
this is so completely like you , just totally contrary .
okay , but why you yelling?
because you wanted to break up with me .
yesterday you wanted to have " the talk . " remember?
i didn't want to break up .
you thought i did .
oh , no .
no , no .
okay .
i saw the sulk .
you were sulking when i came in .
that wasn't a sulk .
it was too a sulk .
your forehead looked like a walnut .
i saw it .
okay , today , i was sulking .
yesterday , total misread .
today , today .
what?
about the talking .
so why'd you cut the hair?
to keep you , dumb ass .
this is too confusing .
i'm out .
be gone , nigga .
i don't care .
who's keeping you?
you're real indignant , considering you stood me up .
i did not .
you stood me up .
it's good .
i'm leaving .
but you stood me up .
you practically forced me to go out on a date with another guy .
what?
yeah .
what other guy?
whoever i was out with , obviously .
where'd you go?
where we were at .
now you fronting .
you a comedian now?
it's good , because i'm up out of here .
how long you been seeing this guy?
you know what?
that's no longer any of your business , now , is it?
did you do it?
no , not really .
you're still together?
no , he dumped me .
he dumped you?
wow .
he's good .
too good .
it doesn't make sense .
you were perfect .
you should get married .
it makes perfect sense .
his best friend shows up , acts like he doesn't know who i am .
talks smack about evan to get me all angry , knows all these great lines ... ... and then lies about what he does .
and what does he do? " you ask .
he masterminds breakups .
it's obvious .
it is?
they did the old bait and switch .
i'd slap that ass .
you give it a try .
no .
what are you gonna do about it?
quincy doesn't know that i know .
he doesn't see that i see the connection with evan .
that i know about that stupid book he wrote .
that's fine and dandy .
i'll keep our little date tonight .
take him down the old romance path .
when he leans in to kiss me , that first awkward kiss of the evening ...
yeah . ... l pull back and laugh .
i'll dump his ass so hard he'll be using a walker .
what?
it sounds a little childish .
it is not .
okay .
maybe evan will realize how much he's in love with you ... ... and then you can suggest couple's counseling or ....
it's time for my rounds .
we'll talk later .
lay back , mr. lynch .
q.
what you doing here?
just helping philip .
forget about philip .
your boy got problems .
i know that .
you ready for this?
i'm in love .
that's what you said .
no , no .
that was lust .
that was just bump and grinding ... ... talking dirty while i'm spanking that ass lust .
this
this is love .
it's nicky .
right .
i broke up with her today .
strange way to show your love .
i wasn't in love with her when i did it , okay?
at least ... ... l didn't think i was .
was i in love with her when i did it?
no .
it wasn't until she told me she was seeing another guy .
that's what it is .
that's jealousy .
that ain't love .
think so?
of course it's jealousy , that's what i'm saying .
why would i be jealous if i wasn't in love?
because we trip like that sometimes .
i think i made a big mistake .
i don't know what to do .
what you think i should do?
buy her something .
diamond rings , clothes .
here we go .
you're no help .
credit card .
i need to find the dude , stick my foot up his ass .
he might be big .
might whup your ass .
you know , if it wasn't for that stupid haircut that she had ....
she cut her hair?
cut her hair .
can you believe?
women know that's an aggressive act towards men .
women cut their hair , it's aggression .
she aggressed me .
no long hair?
no long hair .
thinks she look like halle berry .
come on .
halle be
you know , it's
what's wrong with you?
nothing .
i was bubbling .
you know , my stomach is bad .
i ate some of those taquitos ... ... that they had out in the front .
no , i need to go .
where's a?
i'm gonna go to the bathroom .
nicky?
so , mary .
ls that short for marilyn?
no .
actually , it's not .
so why don't you tell me more about your job as an editor .
actually , you know what i'm trying to do?
i'm trying to write a book .
like a children's book .
of course , a book .
it's called all dogs leave l. a.
because they can't get any attention or any love .
where do they go?
compton .
whatever happened to your sleazy friend and his longhaired girlfriend?
they broke up .
how's he taking that?
feels like he made a big mistake .
does he?
yeah , they say that honesty is the most important element in love .
oh , i don't believe that .
i think it's the most important element in a relationship , but love ... ... doesn't care about it one way or the other .
what does it care about?
ltself .
who the hell do you think you are?
we had a deal .
i don't know what crazy game you think you're playing ...
... but you're out of your league .
gotta be a wrong number .
safe word : rabbit .
grow up .
listen , mr. watson , if you want more than sex , then damn it , just speak up .
but double dealing?
totally unacceptable .
you call me back .
these things are pinching me .
i swear , i don't know who it is .
they gotta have a wrong number .
i don't know who it is .
i'm out .
some other quincy .
yo , wait , baby .
look , i swear i don't know who  oh , you swear what?
that you're honest and forthright?
ls that what you swear?
mostly , yeah .
get all you need , bro .
get all you need .
she took the day off .
but if there's anything i could do for you ....
will she be here tomorrow?
i don't think so .
i been calling .
she hasn't called back .
you have the nicest eyes .
thanks .
ls there something else i can help you with?
i like your hat .
i'm so confused .
me too .
what should i do , mr. lynch?
love me .
and hold your dick , right?
okay .
ls he gone?
yep .
finally .
i think he's really , really sorry .
shouldn't you give him a chance?
i don't know .
you two belong together .
how about it?
lf you hate this girl so much , why can't you break up with her?
it's called fear .
don't get me wrong ... ... she has many fine qualities : beautiful , fun , smart ....
but after a point , you get this feeling of bottomless ruthlessness .
so tell me , you wicked little animal ... ... what is philip offering?
you tell me .
nothing .
stinko .
zip .
book payback .
book?
tit for tat .
i can give you tit and tit .
philip gascon?
but you decide .
you helping philip break up with me , or are you helping me marry him?
oh , shit .
oh , shit .
what is it?
i got a cramp .
where?
it's in my leg .
well , i'll help you rub it .
here?
yeah , right there .
that's where the cramp is .
you're not even listening to me .
hello , philip?
where you at?
sorry .
look , if something isn't done soon , i'll be married .
so why you wanna marry philip?
quincy , quincy , quincy .
i'm a practical girl .
i was brought up dirt poor , wrong side of toledo , by not a very loving family .
i've put together a life for myself based on good looks and street savvy .
i figure another five to seven years to cash in .
it's really all quite simple .
i mean , even the book is theoretical .
just ....
don't fall in love .
that's the main thing .
don't fall in love .
it's dangerous .
somebody could get hurt .
do you love philip?
no .
i like him .
he's nice .
he's a likable guy .
but women don't love men they can manipulate .
what about a man that can manipulate you?
well , if i find one ... ... l'm sure i'll fall in love .
you need to break up with her in public .
do it at the post office , airport .
banks are good .
where there's security .
but you gotta come on with the come on .
you got to be assertive .
i know , i've gotta be assertive here .
yeah .
got to get you
i didn't tell you about the face .
what?
you know about the face?
no .
the face of immutability .
see?
you don't show emotion , hard for a person to be emotional with you .
this breaks the cycle of facial expressions .
it gives off pain , anger and hurt .
yeah , keep that .
keep that .
keep that .
yeah .
now , when you see her , you act , you don't wait .
you say , " it's over .
philip .
what's wrong with you?
nothing .
i want to break up .
excuse me?
yeah , i want to break up .
here?
yes , here .
why here?
to avoid violence .
ln a post office?
philip , it's not you .
i know you .
you're a fedex man .
yeah , whatever .
well , it's not possible .
why not?
because we're getting engaged .
the hell we are .
look , i thought it all through ... ... and it is the best thing to do .
it is the most generous thing to do .
i don't want to be generous .
honey , i'm being generous , not you .
listen , let's face facts , philip .
you are an aging , boring white guy .
without me to define you , you're invisible .
so in good conscience , the loving person that i am ... ... l could not really just let you go .
i just wanna break up .
of course you do .
listen , we'll get a bottle of wine and you can tell me all about it .
okay?
come on .
come on .
buck up .
rufus , my darling .
how's my little baby?
rufus , it's me .
helen .
you stop that .
you have something to say to me?
yeah .
what?
you ever hear of this game , the question game?
no .
it's real simple .
it's where you ask me a question , i have to answer it truthfully .
i ask you a question , and you have to answer it truthfully .
sounds slightly mean and dangerous .
no .
how about i start it out?
what's your name again?
mary?
nicky .
your turn .
okay .
what do you do?
i was an editor at spoil magazine .
then i wrote this handbook on how to break up with your lover .
how long have you known that?
first night at the bar .
how long have you known that my name wasn't mary?
yesterday .
so you didn't know that first night?
hold on .
why'd you go out with me?
because you thought i looked like halle berry .
who was that woman on the phone?
i don't know .
no girlfriend in the shadows with a frying pan?
nope .
none of that .
do you love evan?
i thought i did .
once you knew who i was , you planned to stop seeing me?
i can't do that .
that's my cousin .
it's not right .
but here you are .
here we are .
why is that?
i'm crazy .
how crazy?
not a drop of blood .
what's a girl to think?
i'm bleeding internally .
wait , wait .
wait , quincy , wait .
wait .
maybe we shouldn't , quincy .
why?
you know why .
yeah .
you're right .
you're right .
i gotta talk to him .
yeah . lf we have wild sex tonight , it would only complicate things .
yeah , yeah .
it would .
i'm tripping .
i'm gonna go talk to him .
you know what?
maybe i should just go .
you wanna go?
you want me to?
not unless you want to .
i don't .
don't go .
then why you bring it up?
we could play a game .
naked twister .
no , i have a better game .
really?
the fantasy game .
the fantasy game .

i'll be over here .
all right .

it was a fantasy .
oh , my ....
god .
you got me excited .
i ....
i was feeling ....
oh , what the hell .
oh , god .
yeah .
didn't work out , did it?
somehow it turned into a negotiation .
we started out far apart .
i wanted to break up , she wanted to get engaged .
ln the end , we forged a compromise .
what was the compromise?
we got engaged .
congratulations .
thank you .
so you still want to break up?
more than ever .
you know i believe in straightforward honesty and direct dealings?
i have deep respect for your philosophy .
damn all that .
we gonna write a letter .
the letter states you've broken up .
hell , i'll even write it .
all right?
after that , all you do is change your phone numbers , answering machine .
take a vacation for two weeks , somewhere exotic only you know of .
don't you wanna be somewhere so you can be naked ... ... run on the beach , have fun and frolic?
frolic all you want , then come back and you change up .

yeah .
yeah?
well , i can do that .

and this is a big gesture .
you think she's interested?
i know .
how you know?
i know .
her friend told me .
no , she didn't .
she did .
her dude?
she's just using some loser to get to me , the real prize .
you think he's a loser?
i know he is .
i don't believe that .
that she'd choose that .
believe it .

i see where she's going with this .
she likes little games , and i play along .
