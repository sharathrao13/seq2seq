nile ,
nile , nile , impetuous and turbulent river you're like our queen , the source of life .
asterlx and cleopatra
our story begins in a distant past , in alexandria , or at alexandria , both are possible ... ... in egypt , at the palace of the queen of queens .
the legendary and elegant cleopatra .
enough !
i'm saying egypt's culture isn't all that great ...
there were good times of course .
i'm just saying the current people are decadent .
and that egypt is merely a roman province .
a " province " !
yes ...
until further notice , o caesar ... ... it's not the romans that build the great pyramids .
those pointy things?
and the sphinx?
and the tower of pharos?
what do you think of that?
that's old news .
yesterday ... ... or today , my people are superior .
in fact your people are ... ... greek , and i know better true egyptians .
enough !
i can prove to you , o caesar ... ... that my people are still brilliant .
yes?
how?
painting portraits?
no , by building a palace .
i already have a palace in rome .
you'll get one in alexandria too .
so when you visit the " province " ... ... you'll have somewhere to sleep .
but it will be bigger ... ... and more luxurious than all other palaces .
bigger than " caesar's palace "?
i'd like to see that ...
you will see .
rome wasn't built in one day .
when will it be finished?
three centuries from now?
three months .
three months?
three months?
three ...
... months?
within 3 months you'll have your palace .
it'll never be finished in time .
but fine , i accept the challenge .
if you make it , i'll publicly admit ... ... that your people is still brilliant .
but i have my doubts .
see you in three months ...
he really gets the most of me .
oh no ... why is the floor already finished?
first the water pipes .
now we have to break up the floor .
malococsis , i'm not an architect .
i'm a tiler .
what's that door doing there?
no idea .
ask edifis , the architect .
architects ...
along with cart wrights they're the most incompentent .
malococsis !
edifis ...
i'm happy to see you .
how are you?
terrible !
w ... w ... what's the problem?
the door in the ceiling?
that?
i anticipate .
should you want a second floor , no problem .
and the tiles .
beautiful , huh?
feudartifis , come see .
are they beautiful or what?
beautiful .
malococsis ... trust me ... ... i'm not a cart wright .
you're worse .
you're running two months behind .
watch it , i have connections .
people in high places who could cause you a great deal of problems .
preferably from alexandria ...
architect edifis?
no , that's ... what's it about?
i had to laugh because of the alexandria joke ... ... because people in high places makes me think about monkeys in a tree ...
you don't have to get angry .
my little one ... wake up .
breakfast .
kinepolis ...
what's that?
lovendpis ...
serge ...
artifis ... clean the water .
it stinks .
i don't smell anything ...
i was just doing what i always do .
that's your problem .
you always do like you always do .
yes , i always do .
the floor is weird .
i don't feel it .
where is it?
good day .
edifis , is egypt the most powerful empire in the world?
yes .
no one in the world has more power .
of course i don't know everyone .
the romans and caesar have their doubts .
i'm going to show him what we can do .
ok .
i'm building him the most magnificent palace .
ok .
and you , edifis , will be the architect .
ok .
i'll be the architect .
meaning?
i'll have to ...
al my other architects are busy .
no , i'm not busy .
he's not busy .
edifis , you're the only one available .
i have no time .
i have to finish my work for malococsis .
only the tiles , but anyway ...
my queen , as your architect i offer you my services .
when the crocodiles have fresh water , i could ...
no , you're good , but too conservative .
conservative ...
what does that mean?
i want something new , something refreshing .
but ... help edifis .
find some land .
land?
as you wish .
go , edifis , you've got three months .
three months?
what margin?
because three months , that's merely enough for the plans ... ... and with the foundations , that's three times four , nine ...
three months , that's ...
i don't think that's enough .
edifis !
you've got three months .
exactly !
if you succeed , i'll cover you with gold .
if you fail , i'll feed you to the crocodiles .
where's the sweet little lamb?
they ate the little lamb?
i should build that palace .
then i , neither cleopatra , the rain ... ... the hail nor the locusts ... ... would be egypt's worst nightmare .
17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 ...
474 , 475 , 476 , 477 ...
boss !
boss !
i rushed myself ...
i was thinking about some sort of machine ... ... that would enable us to reach the top of the pyramid .
otis ... can't this wait?
what are you counting , boss?
i'm measuring .
cleopatra wants a palace for caesar .
here .
on this stroke of land .
from there ... to there .
that would be a big palace .
it has to be modern and daring .
that's great .
you can stop now ... ... leave it to the experts .
no time , we've got 3 months .
fine .
and how much extra time?
none .
we've got 3 months , not a day more .
impossible .
that's obvious .
however urgent jobs can be interesting .
it's not urgent , it's suicide .
if i fail , i'll be fed to the crocodiles .
and i saw them ...
a crocodile is fast .
not good .
i can't finish my machine .
did you hear me did you hear me?
yes , no , but ...
sorry , but i can be eaten .
three months starting when?
the clock is ticking .
they've been working on the gardens for years .
and there's nothing .
completely nothing .
we need magic .
we need to be magicians .
gods .
exactly ...
we need magical powers .
yes , it's not good news , but that's it .
when i was little ... ... my dad told me about this druid .
geta getabemix .
getasonixme ...
something ending in ix?
helmutlottix?
it starts with geta ... and ends in ininekix .
how about pommederainettepommedapix .
a druid .
a gallic druid with a magic potion .
it gives people enormous strength .
using that potion i'll finish in no time and stay alive .
imhotep , i didn't expect it , but suddenly i'm freed .
boss ... ... magic potions don't exist .
only on children's papyrus drawings .
get us some workers .
let them start the foundations .
there will be a lane with big statues .
called " big statue lane " .
and there gardens with olive and orange trees , willows , ....
yes , and there the palace , luxurious and magnificent .
with a huge court yard and lots of dancers .
and there a small geranium , yes , that will be beautiful .
that will be really beautiful .
you have to picture it .
yes .
i'm leaving .
see you in a month .
a month?
max .
the time to find getabemix and come back .
go , cannabis .
go , cannabis !
let's go !
you're not moving , cannabis .
move it !
go , cannabis !
where does that mix live?
up north .
he lives up north .
go , go cannabis .
the year is 50 b. c.
gaul is entirely occupied by the romans .
well , not entirely ...
one small village of invincible gauls still holds out against the invaders .
and life is not easy for the roman legionaries who garrison the fortified camps of
totorum , aquarium , laudanum and compendium ...
en garde , gaul .
defend yourself !
one moment please .
what was that?
are you new here?
yes , we've just been transferred .
i understand .
this potion is a magic potion ... ... made by our druid and it makes us stronger .
look .
getamanix !
getamenixme !
what kind of country is this?
incredible , it's minus 8000 degrees here .
i don't have to drink it , i fell in when i was a little boy .
it gives me extraordinary power .
look .
nice , huh?
good day .
where's the gallic village .
if you follow them you'll get there
i'm not going with you , ok?
i'm staying here .
i'm going to think a little .
those romans are good , they fly better than the others .
it's because of their new helmets .
they're more aerodynamic .
listen ...
landing could be better .
excuse me?
are you asterixme?
rix .
asterix .
and this is obelix .
and the dog is dogmatix .
do you know getabamenix?
a druid .
getafix , excuse me for disturbing , but you have a visitor .
sir?
it's me !
he obviously doesn't know you .
i , i , i'm edifis .
i'm tumeris 'son , your old friend .
what a pleasant surprise .
you must be frozen .
i'm very happy to see you .
he's from alexandria .
come warm yourself .
that's the magic potion?
no , chestnut soup .
no .
i can't sell you any potion .
not all of it .
one cauldron .
no .
he won't budge , it's the principle .
a small cauldron .
no .
a flask .
no .
a small flask .
nee .
a cup .
a small cup .
a small cup , that's all .
it's a secret among druids and not for sale .
a little cup is not much .
i'm sorry , edifis .
ok then .
you were my only hope .
the small chance of survival .
but i understand .
you have other things to worry about .
caesar , the romans .
who i'm not fond of .
maybe i'm going to die ...
but it was nice knowing you .
gentlemen ...
midifix ...
but what's wrong?
edifis , wait .
i've been planning to consult some manuscripts ... ... in alexandria's library .
i can't promise anything ... ... but i'll join you .
thanks .
thanks a lot , getamanix .
my ship is waiting , there's enough room for everyone .
there's no time to loose .
let's go , dogmatix .
you're not going to take him are you?
why not?
he's too small for such a big trip .
and egypt is the land of cats .
pack your bags and don't talk about any longer .
don't talk about it ...
accompanied by the arctic wind , on board of the napadelis ... ... a long journey to egypt begins , the land of ra , the sun god .
cleopatra's kingdom would soon welcome ... ... asterix , obelix and getafix
and dogmatix?
what?
i bark .
i'm not allowed to talk anymore , so i bark .
fine .
take him out , before he suffocates .
but it's empty .
" it's empty " .
such a smart dog .
my baby .
how nice .
he wanted to be with me .
he got in there himself .
we were just saying ... ... three months is a little short .
artifis is a real hyena .
do you know hyenas?
just the same .
he wants me dead and he has many talents .
like what?
no , he's rich .
he's got many golden talents .
the egyptian coin .
in gaul not the ones with most talents are the richest .
do we have to fear anything else?
no , nothing .
red beard !
red beard !
men , last time we weren't very lucky meeting those gauls ... ... with their magic potion , and that big dog .
completely outnumbered we had no other option than to ...
run away .
no , not really .
we had to abandon ship as soon as possible .
swimming in that ice cold water .
no , it was nice .
it was ice cold .
fine .
to prevent further trouble , we'll avoid the gauls .
but for any others , no pity !
ship at starboard !
ready to board , daddy .
raise the oars .
calm down , my girl .
besides you're not making any sense .
that's what i thought .
how many ships , boy?
just one , captain , a small one .
egyptian , captain .
egyptian .
egyptian .
sounds good .
this will get us back on track .
" ipso facto et manu militari " .
triplepod .
man your posts .
bosco , gambler , mullet , hoist the sails !
rackham , worley , husk , blow the horns .
get ready to board .
i'm king of the world !
pirates !
help , pirates !
look , pirates .
quick , we have to have to get out of here .
the pirates .
it's us !
the g ...
the ga ...
the gau ...
the gauls !
this can't be happening .
is there an axe here?
watch out .
pardon me .
calm down there .
what are they doing?
cheater !
it's not fair .
good .
sink it yourselves .
they know who we are .
they're old friends .
we've met them many times at sea before .
you see , " abyssus abyssum invocat .
enough of those latin proverbs .
what's that at the horizon?
the lights of alexandria .
let the butterflies of my youth strand .
i don't know why i just said that .
i'm hungry .
we'll be there in the morning .
that's the tower of pharos , a beacon for ships .
a beacon for ships .
egyptians are mad .
it's one of the seven wonders of the world .
the biggest construction ever made by man .
i'm hungrier than a barracuda .
bar ra cu da .
you wanted to see me , edifis .
my queen , the palace is getting along nicely but there is not enough time .
that's why i asked some gallic friends , a druid and 2 warriors ... ... to help me with my task .
i'm here to ask your approval ... ... for their help .
if it's ok with you .
i wasn't sure .
you can ask anyone for help .
finish the palace in time .
that's all i ask .
caesar mocks me every day .
i can't afford to loose this bet .
he's completely full of himself .
completely .
completely .
listen ... ... make sure you finish in time and everyone shall receive gold .
i would like that .
else ... the crocodiles .
i wouldn't like that .
now go .
he's cute with that moustache .
a little old .
no , the other one .
no , too fat .
you do it on purpose?
she's probably got an evil personality , but a lovely nose .
she'll feed me to the crocodiles .
very lovely .
lovely nose , and with a little braid on the side .
i'm going to be crocodile food and he's dreaming about her nose .
do crocodiles taste nice?
could you show a little more interest in me?
a big ant .
what a crowd !
looks like the biannual cattle market of lutetia .
all new breeds of cows are presented there .
a great show .
which kind of cows do you have?
yes , continue .
there's nothing going on .
yes , still a lot of work to be done .
and only 2 months left .
about that magic potion , when i visited you in gaul ... ... you told me you would take care of things .
now i would like to know ...
i said i would see if i could help .
how do you mean?
where did all that sand come from?
that was already here .
all those stones were delivered by the nile express .
hitting those slaves is very violent .
they're not slaves .
they're construction workers ... ... they do this voluntarily and they get paid .
and those whiplashes are for fun?
no .
yes ...
i don't know .
we haven't had any complaints so far .
istou "?
maybe it means " continue " .
the signal that the soup has arrived .
no .
they're relieved .
tradition calls for them to exchange hair .
now they're bonded by hair .
it's a different culture .
do you remember that menhir i threw at caius bonus?
i bet it weighed just as much as that bunch of stones .
you should ask him .
he's best positioned to answer .
it's a different culture .
another bill .
i hate paperwork .
otis , my writer .
writer , that's a comfortable position ...
i don't think there are any good or bad positions .
if i have to summarize my life , i'll start with my encounters .
the people that stood up for me , when i was all alone .
it's strange that coincidence determines your faith ... ... because once you've had a taste of the good life ... ... it's sometimes hard to find someone to speak to .
the mirror that helps you forward .
but not in my case , cause i succeeded .
i thank life ... ... i sing , i dance .
i'm love ... ... and when people ask me why i'm so humane ... ... i tell them it's the taste of love .
which today leads me to this kind of mechanical construction .
but tomorrow might lead me to be of service to the whole community ... ... and i'll give myself .
what's for dinner this afternoon?
lentils .
i'll be back .
this is the place where soon caesar's palace will be .
to be finished in 58 days .
what are you looking for?
i've lost my lentil .
workers
workers .
friends .
have we gone back to the days of the pharaoh's?
slaving away and getting whipped?
and for whom?
for caesar ...
let him build his palace in rome .
everyone at his place and the hippos will be fine .
that's true ...
friends , you are being exploited .
you're being exhausted and ... ... to be honest ...
there .
he's right .
and there two huge statues .
but not too huge .
15 meters high is enough .
and at the edge of the sphinxes , a big kitchen .
next to the bedrooms , that's maybe not ideal .
because of the noise and odour?
could become annoying .
didn't think about that .
why are those grapes so big?
they're dates , obelix .
they grow on those trees .
crunchy on the inside .
that's the stone .
not bad .
lunch break is over .
get to work !
i hardly said anything .
only that lunch break was over .
we're not satisfied !
we're not satisfied !
please?
yes ...
we're not satisfied !
we're not satisfied !
we refuse to work any longer under these conditions .
it's unbearable .
we're not satisfied !
calm down , calm down .
we're not satisfied !
who's in charge?
ok fine .
i'll speak for all of us .
i'm itineris .
i'm listening .
you have two new messages .
first of all : we're working more than 18 hours a day or 36 hours in 2 days .
we want it lowered to 35 hours .
that'll never work .
it'll cause problems .
secondly , and sorry for interrupting you ... ... we want a decrease of at least 50 % .
an increase you mean .
no .
a decrease of the number of whiplashes .
we get too many whiplashes .
some people get headaches from the noise .
their head is ready to burst .
yes ... ... and concerning the food ...
some wild boar alongside the lentils would be nice .
the less whiplashes , the slower you work .
then the palace doesn't get finished in time , and i'll be fed to the crocodiles .
enough , edifis .
itineris is right ... ... to not allow that .
i'm sure they would be happy with some wild boar .
it's ready .
no , you fell in when you were little .
come on , dogmatix .
give them a demonstration , asterix .
be careful , it might be a bit too strong .
it's a little too strong .
no , it's very good .
dogmatix , do a trick .
do a trick .
sit !
it's a miracle ...
is there enough for everyone?
i'll make some more .
no , obelix , you ...
fell in when i was little ....
yes , alright .
no !
obelix , no .
hohis .
that's his name .
nobis?
no , hohis .
with an h .
nexusis .
can i help you?
an imhotep .
two .
i have a job for you .
no problem .
who do you want me to kill?
no , we're not killing anyone .
here you go , two imhoteps .
the construction of the palace has to stop .
they're waiting for stones from the south .
make sure they don't arrive .
no stones , no construction .
no construction , no palace .
no palace ... ... no palace .
here's some gold to cover your expenses .
you give back whatever's left .
nice tunic .
i came , i saw , i conquered .
veni , vidi , vici .
the usual stuff .
cesare " .
cesare " or " caesar "?
caesar .
it sounded cool , but ...
engrave 4 plates .
ave caesar .
power and prosperity ...
power and prosperity , caius c+ .
good news?
i came , i saw , i conquered .
as usual
veni , vidi , ok .
vici is a little premature .
what do you mean?
gaul for example ...
what about gaul?
gaul is vici .
it's completely occupied .
no it isn't .
one small village of invincible gauls still holds out ... ... against the invaders , yes i know .
i've heard it over and over .
and cleopatra , they stopped construction?
no , it's going fine .
it's beautiful .
they even ... on the inside ...
no .
excuse me .
don't touch me ...
they'll finish in time .
impossible .
the gauls don't know the meaning of the word .
edifis got 3 of them to help him .
one of them is the druid teachix .
getafix?
yes , i knew it sounded like that .
aikix and journalduhix .
or malcomix .
keep an eye on them for now .
i'll decide later what to do .
si vis pacem , para bellum .
if you want peace , prepare for war .
brucewillix .
in the mean time , the ruthless nexusis ... ... sent by artifis , was completing his mission .
cut off the supply of stones ... ... by bribing the foul convoy supervisor .
there the buildings can form a " c " , from cleopatra .
it's caesar's palace .
that's possible too .
what do you mean?
the stones have arrived .
the supervisor says there are no more stones in the quarries .
funny language .
he wants to be paid .
he's lying .
no , he really wants to be paid .
no , about the quarries .
there have to be more stones .
i could make him talk .
can i?
ok .
but don't overdo it , he needs to be able to talk .
how do you say " talk "?
in the sense of " i don't speak egyptian very well " ... ... it's " medou ene ere comete " .
if it's " talk a little slower " , then it's " medou ere keteb " .
medou ere keteb " .
no , " ketebece " .
ketebece " .
" keteb " .
ketebece " , when they're 8 of them .
ketebece " .
no , not " ketebece " .
no , sorry .
no one understands you .
keteb " open , " keteb " generious .
say ...
ouchebe " .
ouchebe " .
no?
not " ouchebe "?
no , obelix , not so furious .
he says artifis paid him to throw the stones into the nile .
there are enough stones in the quarry .
ai ...
ai ...
he says ...
yes , ai , i understand that part .
he says " ai " because he's in pain .
i'm in pain .
not the moustache .
not the moustache .
he's finished .
we'll go with him .
i'll stay here to keep an eye on things .
otis will accompany you to ...
yes , to ...
here .
amulets .
lucky charms to protect you .
thanks .
amsterisque .
rix .
risque .
yes , rix ...
risque .
the faith of egypt is in your hands .
isn't that a little exaggerated?
my faith is in your hands .
that's better .
go , amsterisque !
rix .
risque .
so our gallic friends and otis went on their way ... ... to the quarries to get the stones .
what's wrong with your dromedary?
it's my stomach .
while i pack up the boat , you can visit the sphinx .
there will be many restaurants .
you can stuff yourself with all kinds of things ... ... steamed fish , meat in sauce .
i knew it , nothing to eat .
nice , those little sphinxes .
i could make little menhirs .
sphinx !
never mind .
sphinx !
no , thanks .
stranger , a portrait with the sphinx as souvenir?
a statue in 30 minutes?
yes why not?
it would look nice at my place .
do you accept sestertius?
sure .
stand in profile please ... ... shoulders up front .
not to far .
we have to be more alert .
artifis is a snake .
besides the transport he could attack the construction site .
we must organise a guard .
what do you think , obelix?
now where did he go?
obe?
obe .
obelix !
not to short?
no no .
so you're from gaul?
yes .
been pretty hefty there lately ...
obe ...
obelix ...
h !
h !
asterix !
obelix , i'm sure that's forbidden .
come down at once .
how nice ...
come down .
you're being childish .
you look so small down there .
don't be stupid .
get off that sphinx .
i'm going to take a walk on his head .
wise guy .
broken nose .
great .
remarkable .
congratulations , obelix .
you've outdone yourself this time .
we could attach it again .
really?
that's a great idea .
with what?
did you see the size of that thing?
yes , it's a rock .
a cliff .
what am i saying?
a peninsula .
stop making everything so complicated and find a solution .
you're so clumsy , obelix .
luckily no one saw us .
let the greek balm you .
imhotep .
tep .
help me , i only have two arms .
was that lightning?
i told you i saw lightning .
i'm not crazy .
done .
no one will find it there .
fine , let's get out of here .
come on , dogmatix .
not a word about this to getafix .
nothing happened .
no .
nothing .
hey , my pyramids ...
seeing the palace is progressing faster than planned ... ... we demand , which is perfectly normal ... ... an extra day off .
you understand me , put yourself in my place adis .
my name's edifis .
what did i say?
itineris , i don't understand anything .
try to move a little .
now?
no .
how about now?
and now?
try it .
do you understand me now?
because ... ... i've been having that problem a lot lately .
are you alright , obe?
i'm hungry .
how could the build such a thing?
stone upon stone .
indeed .
gauls ...
feel like visiting the pyramid?
for free .
not sure if we can learn anything .
they say it's extraordinary .
we're not in a hurry .
stay here , dogmatix .
guard getafix .
if you're good , i'll give you a bone .
don't loose track of me .
you won't get out of this labyrinth alive .
watch it , the corridors are very narrow .
you can't be too fat .
no one is fat .
on your right , anubis .
touching .
the god of the dead .
through here .
come , distinguished guests , go in here .
these hieroglyphs are beautiful .
after you .
enter .
indeed .
no !
no !
you'll never get out of here .
this tomb will be your tomb !
no way out .
we are stuck .
this tomb will be your tomb !
nice one .
i'm too good .
i knew it .
a free visit .
anyway , enough things to read .
hieroglyphs all look alike .
no .
look , obelix , the colours ... are beautiful .
that's all really nice , but ... ... if we don't find a way out soon ... ... we'll have all eternity to figure them out .
that's that .
if they get out of here ... ... i swear i'll never shave my head again .
first of all we have to get that door open .
but considering the size ...
here , obelix ... ... for the first time you can have some magic potion ..
really?
that's what we said didn't we .
one , two , three drops .
that's enough .
well ...
that didn't seem to do anything .
no , it's geta .
yes , i'm here .
here .
we're running in circles .
the pharaoh's had splendid architects .
we're in a serious situation here .
very serious .
i'm starting to get hungry .
what do those hieroglyphs mean?
there's no time to find out , we have to get out of here .
we must set our priorities straight .
i'm reporting to mister asterix that's i'm hungry .
i keep myself busy to forget i'm hungry .
i forgot mister obelix's stomach was more important .
wild boars and fights , that's all he needs .
mister asterix knows everything better .
yes , maybe .
i'm reporting to mister asterix ... ... who wanted to visit the pyramid that this wouldn't have happened in a menhir .
2 sestertius for that logic .
what's keeping them?
the stones are loaded .
we have to leave .
i was excited .
i was just saying something .
mea culpa .
no , i said mea culpa .
it also could have happened in a menhir .
in any case , i can't get us out of this place .
my friends , i fear this is the end of our adventures .
could someone light a torch?
no , i have the amulets , but that's not going to help .
i'm sorry for edifis .
i'm sorry for dogmatix .
or not , dogmatix?
dogmatix?
yes , so?
don't blame me for bringing him !
his sense of smell lead him to us .
so he can get us out of here .
that's true !
dogmatix , listen very carefully .
if you get us out of here , i'll give you a pile full of bones .
yes !
that's good ...
dogmatix !
excuse me , we're fortunate you brought him .
sometimes i think he understands everything i say .
and they returned to the construction site ... ... aboard ships loaded with stones .
we're going slowly .
very slow .
too slow .
at this speed we won't be back in time for the wild board banquet ... ... lentils aren't that great ...
the nile is an unpredictable river ... ... sometimes impetuous , sometimes quiet .
i wonder if you know this nice egyptian poem .
nile , nile , nile ...
what's he doing?
men !
we're seaworthy again .
hip hip hip ...
hurrah .
hip hip hip ...
hurrah .
watch out !
by toutatis , i know he fell ... ... in a cauldron of magic potion ... ... but he'll never cease to amaze me .
hip hip hip ... hurrah ...
stop it .
and construction was ready to start again .
edifis knew he would be finished in time ... ... which , in the field of construction , was rare in those days .
one sip a person .
just one sip a person .
fake potion is being spread .
same consistency , same colour , but it's pumpkin soup .
the only real potion , is the one you get from the druid ... ... around the cauldron .
thirty minutes from here .
this tomb will be your tomb .
not bad .
jackals , die like jackals " .
but that's jackals twice .
what?
they say hyenas?
locked up in the pyramid?
i don't understand .
they're magicians .
you need supernatural powers to get out of there .
they're tuff , those barbarians .
i need an idea .
got one .
i have a terrible idea .
two .
even three .
i've got a whole bunch of ideas .
i'm so good .
i don't like that laugh .
it frightens me .
get to work !
that's not even close to the luxurious garden we need .
getamanix , you don't have any potion to speed things up?
like seeds for example ... ... that grow into palm trees within no time?
no , potions aren't the solution to everything .
some things can't be changed .
nature needs time to turn the seed ... ... with sun and water , into a bud ... ... and then ... ... that bud ...
please .
please .
it can't go any faster .
yes , fantastic !
can someone get me down from this tree?
they started again?
i'm not happy either .
i also want edifis to fail , for personal reasons .
i was thinking i could be of some assistance maybe .
after we've struck a fair deal ...
not here .
in my tent .
i'm listening .
honourable caesar , if i see to it the construction of the palace fails .. ... you'll appoint me and i'll finish the job in 2 months .
that way you win the bet and cleopatra is humiliated .
alright , if you finish it after 4 months .
three , i can't work any slower .
fine , but not any sooner , or you'll have to pay a compensation .
that's a deal , honourable caesar .
how were you planning to sabotage the construction .
with this .
what shall i wear tonight?
careful , it's very , very tepid .
a gift for the queen of queens .
as a token of honour to the queen of queens .
getafix , obelix and asterix .
how sweet .
can i open it?
oh , that's tepid .
a cake .
tonight's desert .
modest meal , 40 dancers ... ... 80 musicians and 300 simple dishes .
i don't like crowds either .
dinnertime !
ah wild boar ...
finally some normal food .
yes .
with lentils .
that's not really allowed .
it's pork more or less .
we'll pretend we don't know .
nobody moves .
we're here to arrest the gauls .
come on , for three wild boars .
i'll beat them up and then we'll eat .
no , wait .
wait !
you're going to fight the whole garrison?
why not?
that's illegal too?
you can't do anything around here .
edifis is right .
we're going to see cleopatra .
yes , nice opportunity to see the palace .
i'll stay here to keep an eye on the fire .
it tends to go out .
that's why i want to stay .
everything is tasted beforehand .
your scheme failed , gauls .
my taster was poisoned by your cake .
we didn't send any cake .
what cake?
that cake .
i don't see fifty others .
the wild boars , ok , but for that ...
silence !
you tried to kill me .
you will die .
by toutatis !
we are innocent .
you have some nerve .
ridiculous .
we work ... ... all day , breath dust ...
eat lentils ...
yes , no ...
yes we do , lentils .
yes , but ...
we didn't send you any poisonous cake .
a cake like that we would have eaten ourselves .
silence !
this is ridiculous .
if she doesn't want to hear it ... ... you don't say anything .
for now .
take them away .
and give the crocodiles an appetizer .
i'm hungry .
i'm hungry .
hungry !
when i said hello , she turned her head .
we used to laugh , said cuckoo ... and now ... ... all of a sudden ... ... she won't look at me anymore .
i'm a stranger to her .
cleopatra and you said cuckoo?
he's not talking about cleopatra , but about a courtesan .
the one with the nice braid .
wouldn't surprise me if he were in love .
i'm not in love .
i want to tell her i had nothing to do with it .
it's a juridical thing .
juridical , yes .
of course .
stop .
cuckoo , i love you .
it's great to look so stupid ...
subtle ...
sometimes you can be really nice , and sometimes we think you're ... ... a fat idiot ...
who's an idiot?
no idea .
drink .
a sip of antidote .
obelix , not everything .
a sip .
yes , a sip .
now ...
obelix , open the door .
i didn't drink it all .
get out of my way .
yes , and when you come back you'll bring me a suit ...
egyptians are mad .
we ask them to get out of the way but they don't move .
and?
i'm ready .
i'm sick of standing in profile all the time .
can't you sketch my front for a change?
like this ...
modern art ...
please?
can we?
i'd better leave .
gauls , since you want to see my demise ... ... i'll , by osiris , show you how a queen dies .
no , by toutatis , listen to us first .
where are your courtesans?
why?
no reason .
i'm sure the cake wasn't poisoned .
i think it's very tasty even .
obelix , cut 3 pieces of cake .
we said three piece .
one ...
go on .
two .
and three .
obviously .
and?
you can see it's not poisoned .
tell your courtesans .
especially the one with the braid .
her name is guimieukis .
guimieukis .
i had a dream last night .
i'd won a million sestertius .
i bought , shoes .
too big , and ugly too .
unbelievable .
and weird , because ...
that egyptian architect and his proposition ...
ilemauris?
artifis .
yes .
incompetent .
he hasn't achieved anything .
send one of ours , to spy and snoop around .
thinking of someone in particular , o caesar?
someone sneaky ...
cartapus !
yes .
caesar , meet cartapus .
our best spy .
ave caesar .
power and prosperity .
cartapus is a professional .
the queen of camouflage .
if i look that way , you can see me .
when i look this way , you don't .
you can .
you can't .
you can .
can't .
can't .
can .
incredible .
you can't .
can't .
can .
you can .
can't .
you can a little .
amazing .
yes .
she wasn't even trying hard .
they mock me .
four months ...
don't rush me .
i've been waiting four months .
my mother will kill me .
i have connections .
come one , stay calm .
don't touch me !
impossible to stay calm .
malococsis , tomorrow i'll finish everything .
i'll even give you a discount .
i'd like that .
he'd like that .
if you're not there tomorrow , i'd rather not be in your place .
and?
the magic potion gives them incredible strength .
i drank it and now i'm superman .
superwoman .
you don't believe me , o caesar?
we shall see .
malivestus !
slap her .
caesar will personally deal with this matter .
the dice is cast .
alea jacta est .
excuse me .
in the name of caesar !
we know the gauls are hiding here .
i demand that appendix , olympix and mannekepix ...
no , their names are asterix ...
their names don't matter !
if they don't surrender immediately we'll attack .
we're here to help cleopatra .
by toutatis , we're not leaving until the work is finished .
don't be so aggressive .
maybe we can talk !
we'll kill you all .
i knew it .
jeanclaudus .
prepare the troops .
and show no mercy .
antivirus .
my name is antivirus .
arm yourself .
one , two , three ... ... four , six ... five ...
come on .
get in line .
here .
put him in some shade .
so , amateurs , coming to see the professionals at work?
yes , alright .
yes , if you're not used to it , it's rather impressive .
getamanix , magic potion for the workers .
it's their day off .
so ...
this is the palace , there are the gardens .
and there is the temple with the sphinxes .
that's not a good drawing .
no , i'm merely sketching .
in perspective it's more like ...
i would have drawn it more in profile .
yes , you do it all the time ...
those romans are mad .
because of the violence in the next scene ... ... we prefer to broadcast this documentary .
in contrary to common belief ... ... the langoustine feeds exclusively on shellfish .
which doesn't bother his humanity .
careful ...
one got through .
dogmatix , attack !
leave me alone .
i've been beaten already .
alright .
sir , we don't allow such speeding here .
we're not in rome .
ave caius c+ , they withstood the attack ... ... but some managed to get very close to the enemy .
bravo , brave soldiers .
they shouldn't have challenged me .
and what's that?
we got right up to them ... ... but they were nice .
they let us go without beating us too much .
what will we do now?
i'm asking , as an amateur .
attack again !
caius c+ , i'm not sure that's a good idea .
the gauls are invincible ... ... i think we better give up ...
i'm very disappointed by your attitude , centurion antiquarus .
antivirus .
my name is antivirus .
no one humiliates the roman empire .
if it's attacked ... ... the empire counterattacks .
he's mad .
he hurt my throat .
it's too quiet .
i don't like that .
i prefer a little commotion .
stop !
war machines ...
take your positions .
how low can you go .
beautiful landscape .
not good , not bad either .
fire !
destroy the palace !
ready?
ready .
when i lower my arm ... ... you fire .
easy .
there ... bingo .
my palace !
i wonder why all this violence is necessary .
no , it's fine .
come !
fine .
excellent .
with such equipment it's easy .
it's not about the equipment .
oh yes it is .
no .
yes .
no .
yes .
no .
yes .
my palace is turned into a ruin .
go on , romans , fire .
we no longer care .
you missed .
you shoot like girls .
we're still here .
we must inform cleopatra .
she could force ... ... caesar to stop .
no .
no .
no .
no .
yes .
yours sincerely ...
i have an idea .
dogmatix will bring the message .
dogmatix will bring the message .
that dog?
you want me to die?
edifis is right .
i mean ... it's a dog .
he got us out of the pyramid .
go on , dogmatix .
take this message to cleopatra .
he's too young to understand .
i'm hit .
never mind , i'm fine .
men !
we're seaworthy yet again .
aboard our trusty old dragon boat .
it's an extraordinary mast , subtle as a bird .
hoist the sail .
yes .
no .
no .
too far .
i'm amazed .
it should hold .
a big sip .
i'm leaving but i'll be back .
hurry and be careful .
hold on , dogmatix .
run , asterisque , run !
alarm !
i know that one .
he's a grumpy man .
shields !
javelin !
why isn't he stopping?
the magic potion !
citebus , trolleybus , get him !
quickly !
go on !
but that's not my name .
obelix is alone .
go help him .
i'm strong now?
edifis ... ... prepare your sarcophagus .
double evasion .
pryadonis , violence ... ... never solved anything .
stop talking .
wait , i didn't drink any magic potion .
you lost .
are you sure?
very sure .
ok .
no , no !
i beg you , no !
i'm artifis , and i beat edifis ...
the magic potion has worn off .
cleopatra will never get the message .
your family is fine?
yes .
imhotep .
and your father?
fine , imhotep .
and your sister .
everything's ok .
imhotep .
what has become of your nephew?
he's doing fine , imhotep .
and how's business?
sorry , i'm borrowing this cart for a moment .
many customers?
enough , imhotep .
how useful .
we can't catch him .
he's got one with 2 horses .
i can't go any faster .
why does everyone always shout " ja , ja "?
catch me if you can .
how will you get up?
like this .
fighting is ridiculous .
let's work together .
a lion doesn't cooperate with a cockroach .
what?
a lion , you know , doesn't cooperate ... ... with a cockroach .
i understood : " an ion ... ... doesn't calculate .
that means nothing to me .
no .
attack !
when i said lion i meant myself !
i knew that .
what's going on?
the lion doesn't cooperate with the cockroach .
who's the lion now?
say it to my face , if you're a man .
everything ok?
by jupiter , a moment ago he was still here .
we're going home .
gone is gone .
i've had it with edifis .
where are we going?
to cleopatra .
i'm scared .
yes , play it smart .
i know cleopatra very well .
watch me .
i'm afraid i have no choice .
one , two , three , four , five .
antelope and lion .
what does the prediction say?
a message and a loved one .
whatever .
my queen ...
malococsis .
come on in .
go , dogmatix .
give her the message .
that's the message .
and there's the loved one .
my queen , as you may know i'm building .
in fact , it should have been easily finished four months ago .
what?
easily .
he can't get away with that !
thank you , my queen , that you care so much .
by isis , he's a sore looser .
this is typical of caesar .
but this time ... ... he'll have to accept his defeat .
we will finish in time .
no , the construction isn't finished .
that's exactly the problem .
i'll see to it .
you can go now , gaul .
guimieukis , show him the way .
i'll be right there .
pardon me , old man .
come , my dogmatix .
come , my gaul .
i believe you don't understand my problem .
it's that way .
straight ahead .
be careful .
yes .
everything will be destroyed .
everything will be fine tranquilum .
that attack was a good idea , wasn't it?
yes , not bad .
asterix is coming back .
when i lower my arm ...
well?
don't know .
a reflex .
how did it go?
cleopatra got the message .
great .
the magic potion took this long to wear off?
well , it's like this ...
you had a taste of the best magic potion there is .
good .
come , my dog .
dogmatix just came back and he succeeded .
i was sure he could do it .
there's a little pink ...
ave caesar .
somebody wishes to see caesar .
who?
someone .
i understand .
my queen , what a pleasant surprise .
enough !
i rushed over here ... ... without changing , when i heard about what's going on here .
what happened?
when you accept a bet you have to play fair .
the gauls may help me .
i never said ...
if i may say something ...
just one ...
this is not conquered territory .
i demand the romans leave the construction alone ... ... and repair all damages .
but ...
silence !
immediately !
so what do we do now?
what she said .
we leave and repair the damages .
of course , naturally .
i wouldn't want her to sniff her nose at me .
no matter how lovely it is .
the romans are leaving .
that's good news .
they're leaving already?
incredible that each of those romans leaves his footprint in the sand ...
excuse me , i couldn't help myself .
that's alright .
for the first time romans and egyptians were working together ... ... on the construction of the palace .
and just in time ... ... when the last grain of sand fell ...
what are you going to do now , edifis?
i still have to finish my work for malococsis ...
you don't have to worry about the crocodiles any longer .
that's why it could take a bit longer .
not too lang .
can't become a habit in this line of business .
caesar admitted his defeat ...
i bow to the most beautiful queen of all ... ... and to the egyptian people that after the ro ...
and i bow to the egyptians who are the greatest people of all .
cleopatra kept her promise to edifis .
let him be covered with gold !
that was the deal .
cover me with gold .
the queen gave getafix ... ... valuable manuscripts from her library in alexandria .
your nose ...
your majesty is too good , by belenos ...
otis also gave the palace a modern touch .
what's this little chamber for?
it's otis 'invention .
it's the " no effort " .
we chose that name when we noticed ... ... that people can go up and down with no effort .
speak for yourself .
oh it tickles when it stops .
by jupiter .
i want to explore every room of this miracle with you .
the palace is huge , caesar .
it consists of 162 rooms .
it could take a while .
what do you think cleopatra and sesam are doing?
caesar .
cae sar .
nothing unpleasant .
as an exception to the rule ... ... the banquet , that concludes all of asterix's adventures ... ... didn't take place in gaul but in egypt .
those big shrimps are nice .
homarus .
obelix .
that's the pha ra o .
because his name is o.
his name is o and comes from phara .
it's o from phara .
the guy's name is o.
he says he's from phara . from phara .
like the pharaoh .
the boss ... our boss .
you have a lovely moustache .
is it real?
yes .
it's nothing .
you just let it grow .
like your braids ... ... which are nicer then obelix's .
thanks .
you know how to please a woman .
that's a local custom .
in gaul .
good evening .
your name , please .
what for?
it's a private party .
i've got a list .
i'm julius caesar .
sorry , impossible .
there must be a problem , because ...
excuse me .
make some room .
a warm evening?
are you alone?
we're with two , four , six , eight .
it's crazy .
good evening .
there's a problem ... ... i have to be on that list .
how do you spell your name?
c , a , e , s , a , r. julius .
cetaparis , seinesaindenis , c+ , but i can't find any ...
c+ , that's me .
are you c+?
why didn't you say so?
nice harness .
thanks .
i'll see you inside .
are you ok?
have a good time .
can you look for julius?
j , u , l , i , u , s.
sir , i'm not ...
i work here .
i don't know , but i know ...
there's one of my amphorae inside .
with a j?
u , l , i , u , s.
yes , that's right .
julius caesar .
at the queen's table .
good evening .
is it in alexandria or at alexandria?
because in the south of gaul there's a city called avignon .
there's a beautiful bridge .
and people say " at avignon " .
are you a courtesan?
yes , and i used to do other things too .
i can talk without moving my lips .
it's funny , the way ...
i have another one ... here .
every part of your face hides something beautiful .
a rose out of your ear ...
a sphinx from your nose .
that's the pharaoh .
o is his name .
and he's from phara .
that's where he comes from .
where he was born .
the pharaoh , because his name is o.
help !
