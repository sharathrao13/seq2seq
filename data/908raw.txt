talk to who? !
so , while installing these windows , you knelt on some broken glass from the pane you had dropped .

what do you think , mr. leach?
we may be ok on the glass , but what else will they come up with?
oh , george !
oh , my god , i can't believe this is happening .
that's not allowed in here , miss .
are you ok?
it's all right .
i don't think i can handle this .
i was too afraid to sleep last night ...

we slept late .
you made me breakfast .

kevin delaney?
do you want me to rub him out?
anything , you name it .
i have friends making enquiries .
good .
the jewels are very safe .
if i get sent down , it all gets handed back to cut my sentence .
now , to cut my sentence even more ,
i could tell them who done it with me if i wasn't very happy about everything .

thanks a lot .
bye .

so?
he's not sure it was you .
what about you?
no , no , he believes me .
that's why he can't figure out about you .
figure out what?
whether you turned him in or not , stupid !
don't er ever , ever , ever call me stupid .
ok?

that's george's lawyer .
the other guy must be the barrister .
so?

let me know if anything unexpected turns ...
excuse me .

no , i don't think so .
oh .

so george will tell him where the diamonds are?
that's what i'm going to find out .

it's better that you don't tell me .
oh , you know , if it wasn't for george ...
otto tried to k k k kiss me .
i thought he might .
no .

sorry .

an american legal student wants to see me for a moment .
what time is sir john due?
12 . 30 , sir .
right .
come in !
hi .
how very nice to see you .
am i interrupting?
absolutely not .
really?
really .
delighted to see you .
hello .
so .
this is the place .
this is it .
very nice .
i was at the courts this morning .
it's fascinating !
really , so much to know ,
everybody wears these .
do you?
oh , ridiculous !
well , erm
i only have a few minutes .
sorry .
i'm sorry .
but until then , i'm all yours , as they say .
i just have a couple of questions .
i'm having a little problem understanding preliminary criminal procedures .
what exactly is the committal?
ah .
interesting .
basically , it's a preliminary investigation where the prosecution presents evidence that the accused has a case to answer .
that's what it says in the book .
let's take , for example , my friend george thomason .
right .
his committal is on wednesday ...
thomason?
yes .
george thomason?
yes .
do you know him?
i'm defending him .
what are you talking about?
i'm his barrister , his lawyer .
that's so great !
that's so weird , isn't that weird?
oh , i'm so happy you're defending him !
thank you .
he's sure to get off now .
wow !
i can watch you work now !
please .
amazing .
well , anyway .
at the committal , george would then plead ...
not guilty .
really?
the evidence is largely circumstantial .
but wasn't there an identification?
true , but a very elderly lady .
i think they've got the wrong man .
you don't think he did it?
no .
let's just say , for argument's sake , that you did think he did it .
sure , if more evidence against him came to light .
right , right .
you would then advise him to plead guilty , and turn over the jewels to get his sentence cut .
and he would turn them over to who , to you?
theoretically , yes , yes .
oh , of course .
erm .
well er ...
i'm so sorry , i've forgotten your name .
wanda .
wanda !
what a fool , what a fool .
well , wanda , there are three ...
not wanda gershwitz?
yes .
oh , my god .
what?
you're his alibi .
i can't talk to you !
why not?
my dear lady , you're a defence witness !
i'm sorry , i must ask you to leave .
what did i say?
it's not ethical for me to talk to a witness .
everybody does it in america .
not in england , it's forbidden .
i insist , or i may have to give up the case .
i'm sorry .
please .
oh , archie .
i didn't come here to talk about boring criminal procedures .
come on , you know !
you knew the minute i walked in here .
i want you .
what?
hello?
sir john is here .
show him in , please .
make love with me .
pardon?
nothing .
will you take me to bed?
no , sorry .
bye , uncle .
hi !
he's pleading not guilty so you're safe until the trial .
leach doesn't think he did it .
ken says there's a safe deposit box key , but only george knows where it is .
thank you , wanda !
what have you found out?
not a lot .
you realize he's in court tomorrow?
i know that !
so nothing , huh?
nix .
zip .
diddly .
bupkiss .
niente .
oh , it's too big !
no , it isn't , portia .
it's enormous !
no , it isn't !
oh , please , mother !
no !
absolutely not !
i'm so miserable and you just don't care !
do shut up , portia !
all i get , all day , is people complaining to me .
oh dear .
ecco i'uomo .
ooh , le due cupole grandi della cattedrale di milano .
benito mussolini !
dov'll vaticano?
volare
oh oh
e cantare
oh oh ...
archie , i want you to speak to her about plastic surgery .
hmm?
i do wish you'd listen to me .
i want you to speak to portia .
i'll speak to her in the morning .
goodnight , archie .
goodnight , archie !
goodnight , wanda .
goodnight , who?
sorry , darling .
just a stupid case i've got tomorrow with some lousy old hag .
are you george francis thomason of kipling mansions , murray avenue ,
london w9?
yes , sir .
the charge is one of armed robbery .
are we ready for a committal , mr. percival?
yes , under section 6 . 2 , madam .
that is correct , 6 . 2 .
here are the statements , all to be fully bound , please .
stand up , mr. thomason .
you are committed to stand trial at the central criminal court .
there is some urgency about this case .
the main witness , mrs. coady , is elderly and has had serious heart difficulties recently .
is there any possibility that this case might be put down for an early trial?
that is for the old bailey listing officer .
take him down to the cell , please , officer .
hi , hon .
how are you doing?
you look great .
i love your hair .
got time for a coffee?
no , i've g g ...
have you thought about it?
why did he give you this?
eileen coady , 69 basil street .
does he want you to send her flowers?
do her shopping?
show her a good time?
rub her out?
he wants you to rub her out?
he's going to kill her !
fuck off , or i'll kill you .
limey fruits !
so the old lady will m meet with an accident?
eh , k k ken?
sssh .
sssh !
what's so funny?
nothing .
just that wasting old ladies isn't nice .
well , it's better than b buggering people .
i bet you one pound you don't kill her .
all right .
all right .
i love watching your ass when you walk .
is that beautiful or what?
don't go near him !
he's mine ! one pound says you won't kill her !
when could you look at it?
let's think .
my wife's going to the opera on friday .
i'll look at it then and call you on saturday .
i really appreciate it .
thanks .
bye .
hi .
i know we're not allowed to talk .
give me a call .
i can't .
please?
we're not allowed to speak .
we don't have to .
i don't want you for your conversation .
i'd love to ...
what happened?
got a date , friday .
look here !
do you mind not making that terrible noise?
my dogs will be having their nap .
nice doggy .
nice ... doggy .
otto , what are you doing?
it's a buddhist meditation technique .
it focuses your aggression .
the monks did it before they went into battle .
what kind of buddhism is this?
asshole !
it's an early tantric meditation ...
what is this?
to get information , i might have to get friendly with him .
well , we're ready now , at last .
good .
enjoy the opera , darling .
your supper's in the fridge .
marvellous .
be good .
when you say friendly , what are we talking about here?
cordial?
courteous?
supportive?
what?
i don't know .
let's just see what happens .
so , friendly might include actual er what , penetration?
i don't need your jealousy now .
jealousy?
yes .
hey , i'm merely curious .
me?
jealous of that fop?
what about my tits?
does he get to handle them?
yes .
that's my forecast .
i'll stand by that .
nuzzling?
i think $20 million is worth a nuzzle .
80 % chance there .
sucking?
i thought you weren't jealous .
i'm not , i don't believe in jealousy , it's for the weak .
one thing , though .
touch his dick , and he's dead !
i told your father to get the car serviced .
aren't we going , then?
oh , do shut up , portia .
hurry up .
hi .
do you despise me?
no , that's not a word that leaps to mind .
can i stay , then?
of course .
look , ...
wanda ...
i know .
your wife's coming back .
no , it's not her .
she'll be hours .
it's about what i said to you .
it is all right for us to speak .
it is?
provided that we don't discuss the case .
oh .
oh , fine .
it's just , if anyone saw us talking ...
oh , but they won't .
sorry if i seem pompous .
oh , you're the best , archie .
no .
not yet .
i'm thirsty .
what shall i get you?
whisky .
you are the sexiest , most beautiful girl
i have ever seen in my entire life .
get me my drink .
oh , archie .
mm , archie .
so .
if george decides to change his plea , he'd tell you where the loot is first , wouldn't he?
mm?
darling , we mustn't talk about the trial , ok?
i know .
i just meant theoretically .
kiss me there .
oh .
theoretically .
erm .
.. to his legal representative ...
what's the matter?
oh , it's wonderful , archie .
ooh !
aah !
what?
what , darling?
you're getting me hot !
sorry .

something cold?
maybe in the fridge?

your moaning worried me .
i was faking it , stupid !
don't ever call me stupid .
and i'm not jealous .
then leave !

his wife , his wife !
for goodness sake , get off to bed .

hello , honey .
what happened?
n n nothing .
what's that?
er ...
not granny?
not yet .
oh .
who is it for , then?
a f f f ...
a fish?
frenchman?
a phone operator?
friend .
oh , a four legged one?
where's my sister?
she's in the b b b ...
thank you .
lavatory .
wanda !
anything?
what?
no?
why are you here?
i'm here because i'm bored !
bored , wandering around this awful city , shoving george's pic ...
talking to a lot of snotty , stuck up , intellectually inferior british faggots .
they get rigor mortis in the prime of life in this country !
standing there with their hair clenched counting the seconds till the weekend , so they can dress up like ballerinas at the flat at four 2b , saint ...
to be honest , i er ... hate them .
i mean , pretending they're so fucking lawyer ...
so fucking superior with those phoney accents .
not you , ken .
you've got a beautiful voice when it works .
son of a bitch !
so er ...
want to have some lunch?
have you heard from him?
who?
archie .
no , i have to finish my hair !
nothing?
ok , i'm out of here !
no plans to see him?
no .
ok , bye , bro !
bye , wanda !
oh , sorry .
what? !
it wasn't theirs to sell .
a old lady gave it to them to engrave .
someone put it in the display cabinet ...
that's their problem .
no .
legally ...
you paid for it !
they accept their mistake and they're offering you this .
it's much more valuable .
i adore this and you want me to give it back ...
i don't want ...
they can't have it .
wendy .
no .
no !
wendy !
no !
tell them they can't have it !
you're the bloody barrister !
hello .
hello .
oh , archie , it's beautiful .
it's just beautiful .
oh , my god , look !
oh , archie , it's beautiful .
isn't it wonderful?
whose is it?
it belongs to someone at the chambers .
and where are they?
hong kong .
ah so .
gone for weeks .
nice rug , archie .
may i?
archie , what are you doing?
the polka , i think .
you make me feel free !
free?
do you have any idea what it's like being english?
being so correct all the time?
being so ... stifled by this dread of doing the wrong thing?
asking someone , 'are you married? 'and hearing , 'my wife left me . '
or saying , 'do you have children? 'and hearing , 'they burned to death yesterday . '
wanda , we're all terrified of embarrassment .
that's why we're so ... dead .
most of my friends are dead .
we have these piles of corpses to dinner .
but you're alive , god bless you .
and i want to be .
i'm so fed up with all this .
i want to make love with you , wanda .
i'm a good lover .
at least , i used to be in the early 14th century .
can we go to bed?
yeah .
hang on !
mind your head .
agh !
aagh !
aaagh !
aaagh !
i think i love you , wanda .
oh , archie .
can i ask you a question?
anything .
where's my locket?
i couldn't get it .
what?
wendy wouldn't give it back .
look ...
i got you this instead .
do you like it?
no .
archie , i have to have mine .
what's the matter?
why?
my mother gave it to me on her death ... bed .
oh , i'm sorry .
all right , darling .
i'll get it for you .
you promise?
i'll think of something .
sex is very , very difficult for me with somebody that i don't trust completely .
i promise i'll get it .
ok?
ooh !
i love you , archie .
i've loved you ever since the first second i saw you !
what was that?
what?
your brother didn't bring you here this time?
no .
he's no idea?
he doesn't have a clue .
what?
he is so dumb ...
really?
he thought the gettysburg address was where lincoln lived .
those terrible lies he told about the cla !
so painful !
when he heard your daughter's name was portia , he said , 'why did they name her after a car? '
i love the way you laugh !
i love you , you're funny .
how come a girl as bright as you can have a brother who's so ...
don't call me stupid .
jesus christ !
ouch !
otto !
come on !
i'll deal with you later !
what have you done with her?
she's all right !
otto !
now , apologise .
what?
shit !
are you totally deranged?
you pompous , stuck up , snot nosed ,
english , giant twerp , scumbag , fuck face , dickhead asshole !
how very interesting .
you're a true vulgarian , aren't you?
you're the vulgarian , you fuck !
now , apologise !
what?
me to you?
apologise .
all right , i apologise .
you're really sorry?
i'm really , really sorry .
i apologise unreservedly .
you take it back?
i do .
i offer a complete and utter retraction .
the imputation was totally without basis in fact , and was in no way fair comment .
it was motivated purely by malice .
i deeply regret any distress my comments may have caused you or your family .
i hereby undertake not repeat any such slander at any time in the future .
ok .
miserere dominus
miserere dominus
canis mortuus est
you said you loved him !
right , otto !
here's a multiple choice question .
a. wanda was lying .
b. wanda was telling the truth .
which one are you going to pick?
what was the first one?
you said you were not seeing him !
i knew you'd come and fuck it up !
i was dealing with something delicate .
i'm setting up a guy who's important to us .
he knows where the loot is and if you'll be arrested .
you lope in like rambo without a jockstrap and dangle him from a window !
now , was that smart? !
was it shrewd?
was it good tactics , or was it stupid? !
don't call me stupid .
oh , right !
to call you stupid is an insult to stupid people !
i've known sheep that could outwit you .
i've worn dresses with higher iqs .
you think you're an intellectual , don't you , ape?
apes don't read philosophy .
yes , they do .
they just don't understand it .
let me correct you on a couple of things , ok?
aristotle was not belgian .
the central message of buddhism
is not every man for himself .
you read ...
the london underground is not a political movement .
those are mistakes .
i looked 'em up .
now .
you have just assaulted the one man who can keep you out of jail and make you rich .
so what are you going to do about it , huh?
what would an intellectual do?
what would plato do?
apologise .
pardon me?
apolo ...
what?
right !
i'm sorry .
no .
not to me .
to archie .
and make it good , or we're dead .
oh , i'm so very , very , very , very s ...
fuck you !
i'm s ...
i'm very , very s ...
i'm so very s ...
very , very s ...
very , very ... ssfff ...
ugh !
hello , mr. burglar !
going somewhere?
think you can rob mr. leach?
i'll teach you a lesson .
he's a very good friend of mine .
otto !
otto !
he'll be very pleased with me when he finds you all tied up and ready for the police !
and don't call me otto .
to you , i am
aagh !
oh , god .
i'm sorry .
i'm sorry .
i'm sorry .
please .
i'm sorry .
i'm sorry , i didn't know it was you .
how could i know it was you?
i mean , how could you expect me to guess?
stupid jerk !
what the fuck are you doing robbing your own house?
you asshole !
you stupid , stiff , pompous english ...
agh !
i'm sorry .
i'm sorry .
er ...
er ...
yeah .
god almighty !
bloody hell !
darling !

oh , no !
well , are you hurt?
no , i'm ...

bit of a headache .
i er ...
i came in here , somebody hit me , tied me up ...
my god , is that the time?
what?
i didn't realise it was quite so late .
what? !
i'm late for a conference .
you've just been attacked !
it's nothing , i must fly .
sorry .
archie !
i'll help you tidy up later !
hello , portia .

your father has finally gone completely mental .
hi .
archie !
thank you so much .

why not?
why not indeed !?
afterwards , ...
yeah? .. let's go to south america .
what?
let's fly to south america .
why south america?
ok , ...
iceland?
what do you really want out of life?
i don't know .
why do i like you so much?
archie .
hm?
do you speak italian?
i am italian !
sono italiano in spirito .
ma ho sposato una donna che preferisce lavorare in giardino a fare i'amore appassionato .
uno sbaglio grande !
but it's such an ugly language .
how about ...
russian?
