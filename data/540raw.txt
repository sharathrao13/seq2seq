welcome to hazzard county .
a little corner of the world where everyone knows everyone else ... ... and people are never too busy to stop and say howdy .
shoot , some folks even say this is where the apple pie was invented .
yep , basically everything down here moves a little bit slower ... ... unless , of course , your last name is duke .
man , the general's in good shape .
bo , it's happy hour at the boar's nest , and we still got two deliveries to make .
it's all one big happy hour , luke .
besides , we're taking a shortcut .
hi , luke .

no questions , only unsers , as read by laurence fishburne .
i'm too old for this shit .
that's what i was thinking as i turned into the final lap ... ... running fourth at talladega .
but then it hit me .
life is like a racetrack .
you gotta keep going round and round .
that is so true .
sure , sometimes you crash and burn .
but if you don't make the turn , you ain't never gonna learn .
so i gripped the wheel tighter , checked my gauges , and made my move .
make my move .
give you my move .

i bet you the old phone book i don't break a bottle .
phone book it is .
daddy , you get me close , and i'll put a bullet in this son of a bitch .
goddamn it , jimmy !
who says i can't shoot?

cousins closer than brothers .
both big hearted , strong willed ... ... and restless as a couple of cats thrown into a swimming hole .
nice driving , cuz .

i won the bet , you son of a bitch .
oh , come on .
i didn't break any bottles , so i won the bet .
i was just joking about the bet .

hell , you know that'll never happen .
maybe one of these days you'll wise up and come work for us .
we could use a man like you .
i don't know .
i don't think it's a good time to be in the moonshine business .
moonshine business?
we ain't in the moonshining business .
but if someone were in the moonshining business , why would it be a bad time?
now , luke , you know i can't say anything .
boss hogg'll tan my hide .
he spanks you?
hey , dil , what do you want?

of course , some people say the boys 'first steps ... ... landed right on the sheriff's last nerve .
dukes .
just once you two ought to try leaving a place ... ... in better shape than it was when you walked in .
oh , i think your boss can afford to replace a few broken beer mugs .
i heard there was a little incident earlier ... ... concerning a certain crappy orange hot rod out at the miller farm .
y'all really upset some of them construction boys .
when i got there , they were not being gentle with your beloved piece of crap .
what'd you do , rosco?
i can't say she's gonna be in real good racing shape for the rally this weekend .
you watch yourself , hillbilly boy .
come on , boys .
my shift's over .
i'll take you over to cooter's .

mostly cosmetic damage , right , cooter?
mostly .

meanwhile , you boys take my truck .
what if you need to tow somebody?

by the power vested in me by the county of hazzard , georgia ... ... l hereby seize this property ... ... for the crime of producing and distributing moonshine .
now , jesse , we can do this the easy way ... ... or , of course ... ... there's that other way .

only way i'm leaving this farm is in a wooden box .
well ....

well , now .
lookie there .
moonshining .

i don't understand how they could just take your farm .
they planted a still in our barn .
they planted a still?
now , why would they need to plant a still?
because they're too damn dumb to find our real one .
i was waiting on old bill miller up at the truck stop last night .
he said boss 'men seized his land for some trumped up charge too .
maybe it's got to do with all that construction equipment up at the millers '.
you wanna go up there and take a second look?
oh , i don't know , boys .
oh , now , pauline .
don't worry , uncle jesse .
we're gonna take care of it .
you know what's gonna happen , don't you?

that's why we love you , honey .
oh , goddamn it .
well , well , well .

what's it look like?
i'm building a doomsday machine ... ... gonna aim it right up your heinie hole .
you stupid enough to think you can fix this?
i'm fixing to fix it .
oh , you fixing to fix it .
you couldn't fix an election if your brother was the governor .
what do you want , rosco?
this here vehicle , it was used in the illegal transportation of moonshine .
boss wants it impounded .

and i might need a ride too .

i'm in a crawfish boiling mood .
well , it seems that the duke boys ... ... have stolen your safe .

hogg has been paying that kid prickett a lot of money ...
... to race here saturday .
he's paying him?
y'all better get your asses back here quick as you can , got it?
ten four , shepherd , this is lost sheep out .
what's this?
what's these crackers doing in our place?
turns out prickett came back because hogg paid him a assload of cash .
don't mean billy has anything to do with strip mining .
you got to be kidding me .
oh , shit .
roll them up .
what the hell is this , man?
looks like somebody's lost .
look , a couple of white boys playing black . ls that's what's going on?
actually , we were at the geology lab for some environmental stuff , and
no , i get it .
they on one of these reality shows .
who wanna get they ass kicked?
yeah .
why don't you two hillbillies join us up here for a minute?
actually , we prefer appalachian americans .
man , get out the car !
now , which one of you two brothers is michelangelo?
there's a certain creek that people sometimes canoe up without a paddle .
you could say that the duke boys were on that particular creek right now .
let's kick they ass , jerry !
never thought i'd say this , but , hot damn , it's the cops .
there goes the canoe .
give me your shoelaces .
what?
these guys over there gave me theirs .
see , i'm gonna fashion myself a lasso .
when the jailer comes in , i'm gonna rope his keys .
luke and bo duke are home free .
period , end of story .
i got on cowboy boots , cuz .
i like your style .
you gonna need those shoelaces?
we gonna have to get out of here .
hey , yul brynner .
we gotta make a phone call .
we gotta call our lawyer .
what the hell are we in here for?
well , where should i start?
we know you're gonna strip mine hazzard .
do you , now?
well , that's good .
guess where i'm gonna sink that first drill .
right down in the middle of your bedroom .
y'all do still share a bunk bed , right?
hey , that's a phat suit there .
what , you some type of pimp?
what has strip mining got to do with you paying billy prickett to race tomorrow?
you like magic , luke?
sleight of hand?
see , while you're looking over here , something's really happening over here .
you see , despite the fact that i now own your beloved farm ... ... l can't legally mine it , because the county won't let me .
i need to hold a public hearing , you know ... ... to give the citizens of hazzard a chance to object .
and let me guess , you're going to hold the hearing during the rally tomorrow?
and if nobody knows about the hearing , there won't be anyone there to object .
there you go .
sleight of hand .
sleight of hand .
grow the fingernails out .
then pop some fingernail polish on them bitches .
ls billy prickett in on it?
prickett?
prickett's just collecting a paycheck .
we ain't gonna let you get away with it .
really?
tomorrow , if you happen to be strolling by the courthouse about noon ... ... you might wanna rush right in there and voice your objections .
voice this .
dadgum it .
i just remembered .
tomorrow morning you're going to the georgia work farm .
and i hear they have a rather strict policy on weekend passes .
yo , b. you need to pop a feather in that hat , yo .
then your man ho's will be having more respect for you .
i have $ 1 00 right here ... ... for whoever knocks that loudmouth son of a bitch out .
thank you .
now , break some rocks for me , boys .
take care , now , you hear?
bye bye .
don't you know you're not supposed to wear white after labor day?
all right , here's what we're gonna do .
when we stop for gas , we call up cooter and tell him to put a pig in the road , right .
then when the cops are moving the pig , cooter hooks up a cable to the bumper .
car drives away , the hook will pull out the whole chassis .
he can't drive without a chassis
all right , shut up back there !
my cousin's starting to go crazy .
we gotta get him to a hospital .
i think he done caught the fever , or something .
that's what happens when you're humping livestock , hillbilly .
can we help you guys out with anything up there ... ... oblige you with a reach around or something?
of course , you'd have to un cuff us first .
sarge , if you and me was to have a chase , you think you could catch me?
appears to me you caught already , son .
i'm serious .
lf i had my car and you was in this one , you really think you could catch me?
because , bubba , this car feels kind of slow to me .
she's got plenty under the hood , don't you worry about that .

i think something bounced up into my undercarriage .

ma'am , i'd be pleased ...
... to check your undercarriage .
thank you .
i stopped you because your taillight is out .

sir , you hit me .
because your taillight is out , and we couldn't see you brake .
you're gonna write me a ticket?
yep .
this is ridiculous !
ls there anything i can help you out with today , ma'am?

she was looking at me the whole time .
let's get out of here .
where are the goddamn keys?

you told me she wasn't emotionally available for me .
that it was better to lose a lover than to love a loser !
because you would faint every time you saw her !
i don't faint .
you called me a loser?
i was trying to make him feel better .

hogg , you lay one hand on them ... ... and i'll shove a apple in your mouth and my foot up your ass .
well , you bring the vaseline .
we'll make it a party .
